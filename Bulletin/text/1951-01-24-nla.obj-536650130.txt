FAMOUS NOBLE KENILWORTH,
YOUR WALLS
ARE STURDY STILL!
pOUR miles from Warwick are the
A magnificent ruins of Kenilworth
Castle immortalised by Sir Walter Scott
in his novel “Kenilworth.”
The original castle was founded in
1120 during the reign of Henry I by
Geoffrey de Clinton, Treasurer of Eng-
land. His son, who became chamberlain
to Henry II, built the great keep, a
massive stone structure over eighty feet
high. The castle came into the possession
of the Crown and further additions were
made by Henry II, King John and
Henry III, During the latter’s reign
(1216-1272) a great artificial lake cover-
ing more than a hundred acres surround-
ing the fortress on three sides was formed
as an additional defence.
In 1248 Henry III unwisely granted
Kenilworth to his brother-in-law, Simon
de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. Fifteen
years later de Montfort led the barons’
rebellion against the king, who was de-
feated and taken prisoner at the Battle
of Lewes in 1264. The King’s brother,
the Earl of Cornwall, was also taken
prisoner and confined in Kenilworth
Castle, which was taken by the forces of
Henry III in 1266 after a siege lasting six
months.
John of Gaunt, Edward Ill’s fourth
son, strengthened all the defences of tha
castle and built an enormous banqueting
hall which rivalled that of Westminster
in London. During the next century and
a half Kenilworth had many royal
visitors and it was the favourite retreat
of Henry V. It continued to be a royal
fortress until 1562,-when Queen Elizabeth
granted it to one of her courtiers,
Robert Dudley, whom she later created
Earl of Leicester. His improvements to
Kenilworth cost £60,000 and he spent
lavishly on entertaining the Queen, who
visited the Castle on four occasions
between 1566 and 1575. On her last
visit the entertainments provided for
her enjoyment included plays, tilting,
pageants and elaborate ceremonies which
lasted nineteen days. The lavish scale of
these entertainments was graphically
described by Sir Walter Scott.
In 1648 Cromwell gave Kenilworth to
some of his officers in place of arrears
of pay and today the castle stands as a
magnificent relic of the turbulent days
through which it passed.

BABBITT AND BUTTON.
May I add a comment on the Red
Page’s admirable review of Brian James’s
novel. The Advancement of Spencer
Button ? It refers to a comparison made
there of the character-presentation of
Spencer himself with that of Babbitt.
To me, it seems less a question of com-
parison between those two characters than
between a problem of construction in
the two novels.
In Babbitt, it is the character of Babbitt
which dominates the whole background.
He is in the forefront of every scene, and
only subject-matter is selected from the
background which has to do with his
affairs. To carry a novel on such terms,
its central character must be a positive,
active, dominant personality, with all
events in the novel dramatised on his
immediate conflict with its minor char-
acters. In Babbitt, these minor characters
are given only small parts, in relation to
Babbitt, and none is brought to a
dramatic finality save Paul, and
he only because the debacle of Paul’s
life brings Babbitt’s simmering rebellion
over the dissatisfaction of his being to
a crisis.
In Spencer Button, this constructive
problem is reversed, for the background
is the central motif of the novel, and
Spencer’s career the thread which holds
the whole mass of it together. If Spencer
had been a positive, noisy, self-assertive
character like Babbitt, the background
would have receded into a flat pattern,
and its rich, colored and positive quality
would have been lost. There would
hardly be room on the same stage for a
dominant Spencer with such a tremendous
dominant as Mr. Goodman (“Six of the
best”) or for a socially-pushing Spencer
with such a self-assured social stylist as
Mr. Shaw Wilson, or for a polemical
Spencer with the grievance-mongering Mr.
Wallace Campbell.
One of the amazing feats of the novel
is that in those three personalities alone
there is all the substance of three full-
length novels. The same may be said of
the Ogg family, or the hopeless, helpless
Mr. Foil. Each one of them has a be-
ginning, a middle and an end. Such
prodigality can only come from a mind
richly stored with subject-matter from the
spectacle of life, a satanic eye for human
idiosyncrasies, and a plastic pen for
drawing life-size portraits. The ease with
which such a function as Empire Day is
crowded with vivid pen-sketches is com-
parable only to those dashed-off by
Dickens at the Veneering dinner-table, or
the guests attending a Merdle banquet.
And Spencer’s slow development,
watchful and cautious, dodging conflict
but taking advantage of it, has the effect
of highlighting all the contentious person-
alities surrounding him. Finally, that
personality of Spencer’s is essential to the
spiritual drama of the novel, which is
that of a mdfi who funks the emotional
adventure of his ego and whose life is
given over to the dry mechanism of
affairs. The Winnie Ogg episode con-
denses this universal complexity in
a manner truly Balzacian. One
must pause at that episode because
it puts such a sardonic accent on
tile novel’s title. The Advancement of
Spencer Button. Advancement where?
To the attainment of a headmastership or
into the limbo of emotional frustration
and the death of aspiration for a reward-
ing love-affair?
The essence of greatness in a novel is
that inspired capacity in the novelist to
stamp on the reader’s mind an unfor-
gettable gesture which will remain as the
dramatic apex of the novel; the supreme
revelation of whatever may be the
novel’s psychological theme. When old
Grandet, dying, reaches out to grasp the
crucifix which the priest is holding, it is
not the crucifix he reaches for, but the
gold from which it is made. When
Babbitt, seething with rebellion against
the codes and taboos of his class which
deny him the right to think for himself,
is vaporing resentment against them at
the club, he sees Virgil Gunch looking at
him. Just looking. But this looking
conveys to Babbitt such a threat of
pariahdom, such an ostracism from all
the rights and privileges of his fellows,
that Babbitt’s spirit falters and he escapes
from the club. But on the pavement an
uneasy impulse makes him look round.
Virgil Gunch is standing behind him,
looking at him. And Babbitt’s nerve
cracks. He throws up his one insurgent
effort at self-identity and crawls back to
submerge himself in the mob.
That episode at the morgue in Spencer
Button epitomises just such a dramatic
apex; a crisis of spiritual defeat from
which there is no appeal, no escape:
An officer took him to the body. “Is it?”
“No, I’m certain it isn’t. I mean, I’ve
never seen her.”
The officer looked hard at Spencer. He
was very white.
“Quite certain?”
Spencer shook his head, not trusting his
voice. Then he burst into tears and strove
vainly to check them. The hardened
attendant wasn’t surprised—nothing could
surprise him now —but he said, not un-
kindly, “Come along—it’s a dreadful place,
I know.” He knew as well as anybody that
tears are so often a maudlin luxury—a
poor nameless pity for oneself. He led
Spencer out. “Ah well, what did it matter,
anyway? It wouldn’t make the slightest
difference,” he thought to himself; and
then said to Spencer “Have a stiff whisky,
old man, and get the taste out of your
mouth.”
So it was all as simple as that, was it?
For Spencer could have saved the
simple Winnie from the streets and a
suicide’s end in the Harbor. When
scandal descends on the Ogg family by
the defalcation of the council’s funds by
Ogg senior and his flight from the town,
and Winnie and her mother are ostracised
by the community, and shut up alone in
their house, Spencer has not the courage
to brave the social taboo against them
and call and see Winnie. He walks up
and down outside the house, trying to
persuade himself that it would make
matters worse for Winnie if he called on
her, and then sneaks off for fear anyone
should see him hanging about the house.
And that action morally destroys both
Winnie and himself. When in middle-age
he snatches at a furtive love-affair —that
last reaching-out for an emotional
adventure before it is too late—that
abortive overture is finally felled by Miss
McCree’s dismissal of him as “A safe
man,” too safe to take a risk with life,
too safe for a woman to risk an illicit
love-affair with in the future ...
I submit that Spencer had to be pre-
cisely the man he is both to carry his
own private drama of frustration and
the whole novel’s packed mass of material.
A writer can’t have it both ways. The
hero-problem—that is, a central character
on whom to carry the narrative—has
always been a baffling complexity to the
novelist. Scott, Dickens, the greatest of
them, made a mess of it, with their
popular-fiction dummies round whom
their vitally-alive minor characters create
the novel’s reality. Fielding is the only
great novelist who created a fully-alive
hero, out of his Tom Jones. And Spencer
is a definitely alive personality. Just as
in Babbitt, the emotional bridge is
created between Spencer and the reader.
Everybody at some point has fingered at
the signpost of Safety First. Every
maturity has known disillusion at an
objective attained.
There is another tribute, a personal one,
which I must pay to this splendid novel.
It has lifted, for me, a nagging pre-
occupation of years; a preoccupation
that must obsess anyone who subjects
self-esteem to the status of his country’s
national culture. We have established a
sound plastic tradition in Australia. We
have poetry of the highest quality here.
We have novels, but not the novel; the
novel which will give a compact presen-
tation of the normal fife of a people—
which will concentrate in a group the
whole content of the mass. In short, the
national novel, as distinct from the purely
aesthetic novel, which is concerned only
with dramatising the private fives of its
characters.
Such a national novel must take a city
for its background, for a city concentrates
the life of a people at a higher intensity
than that of a bucolic community, with
its more temperate rhythm, its less com-
bative stress on the struggle for existence.
When I got back /to Australia after a
year spent in America, and reviewed
Sydney from a refreshed angle, an appall-
ing thought hit me: this city had not
got a novel.
True, Sydney had Jonah, but that
novel presented only a small and localised
section of the city, and dealt only with a
selected section of its denizens; the pro-
ducts of its slums. Other small sections
of Sydney had been recreated in two
works that will endure, a picture of Cir-
cular Quay as it was in the ’seventies in
Conrad’s Mirror of the Seas, and a
glimpse of the Domain in Stevenson’s
Wrecker. But for the rest, Sydney, and,
for that matter, the people of Australia,
have remained a blank in type-matter, as
far as the rest of the world is concerned.
For the purely national novel has this
peculiar property. It is the only type
of novel which can reveal the life of
one people to another, for if a writer has
the power to create such a novel, it will
deal with the common denominators of
all peoples; their aspirations, spiritual
and mundane, their eternal conflicts of
personalities and affairs, their desires,
loves, hates, attainments and frustrations.
In two novels, Main Street and Babbitt,
Sinclair Lewis revealed the whole Ameri-
can people to the world at large. The
past great novelists, Dickens, Balzac,
Scott, Cervantes, had done the same thing
so completely that we have absorbed the
whole content of their countries, cities,
peoples without ever needing to get out
of an armchair.
Well, Sydney has got its novel at last,
a novel that will endure, wifi become a
classic, will, in time, make its denizens,
and the people of Australia, citizens of
the world. The Advancement of Spencer
Button has advanced the Australian novel
into the area of all that is great in the
metier of the novel.
NORMAN LINDSAY.
Sketches in Verse.
As the author of that beautiful
sequence of poems Christopher
Columbus, one of the finest achievements
in all Australian poetry, William Hart-
Smith is a man to be watched with care
and to criticise with circumspection: he
has a way of writing very lightly, very
slightly, almost invisibly, and then
when he puts all his slight pieces together
you have something as bard and glitter-
ing as diamond.
Most of the poems in his new collection
On The Level (printed by Timaru
“Herald,” N.Z.) are the tiny Canterbury
landscapes and seascapes he has pub-
lished from time to time in The
Bulletin ; fine, small, delicate pictures
of seagulls riding on a wave—“and up
they go and down they go”—or old pine-
trees uprooted by a storm with “yellow
plates of clay around their roots” ; verses
more like pen-drawings than like poems,
where the writer is content to set down,
with a note of wonder, a precise picture
of what he has seen and to leave it
largely to the reader’s mind to magnify
the image into poetry.
Then there are a few more complete,
more rounded poems such as “Shoes” and
the lovely “Bathymeter” in which the
poet makes explicit the symbol and the
emotion which elsewhere are only sug-
gested—a pair qf shoes placed tidily side
by side under the bed becomes an image
of the necessity for order in the universe
and of the terror of chaos ; and the cor-
respondence of stars in the sky and
phosphorescent fish in the depths of the
ocean becomes another image of
harmony:
this dance of stars in solemn time
and fish in swing is certain proof the Lord,
whoever he be, cannot resist a rhyme.
And with these “pen-drawings” and
lyrics go a few semi-narrative poems
which look like tentative steps towards
another sequence in the style of
Columbus: two poems on Marsden and
two on the shepherd named Mackenzie
who gave his name to New Zealand’s
Mackenzie Country and who was accused
of sheep-stealing; all fine pieces of
verse.
On the whole it is a book of sketches
and beginnings, but full of sensitive feel-
ing for nature, sensitive language and
verse-craft.
A New Chevallier.
Gabriel Chevallier is so delightful a
writer and so clearly an immortal in the
tradition of Rabelais and Maupassant,
and his Cherry (Seeker and Warburg) is
so good in its way, that one really feels
apologetic for not liking the new book so
much as the novels that went before it.
But the way in which Cherry is good is
not quite the way of Clochemerle, Sainte
Colline, The Euffe Inheritance or
Mascarade: it is not a novel but, simply,
a pen-portrait of a small girl, from her
third to her twelfth year, drawn from
life. Cherry is the daughter of one of
Chevallier’s neighbors.
Chevallier’s balance of mind shows very
nicely in the book, for Cherry is neither a
monster in the modern manner nor a saint
in the Little Nell tradition, but a lively
and engaging mixture of all the virtues
and most of the vices common to man-
kind. It is lightly and humorously written
and both deep and wise as a study in
child-psychology:
What pleases me most about Cherry is
that she is absolutely natural. She has
acquired a stock of hymns, improper songs,
polite phrases overheard in drawing-rooms,
philosophical tags, terms of endearment
and coarse expressions into which she dips
to suit the requirements of her passing
moods or fantasy, or to suit the importance
and status of whoever is asking her ques-
tions.
A new or out-of-the-ordinary word will
amuse her for a day or two; then it slips
into the ragbag of her memory. A new
game takes her fancy for an hour; and
everything is at first a game, whether it be
writing, sewing, cooking, saying her prayers,
confession or a tummy-ache. But nothing
gives her quite the same pleasure as the
activities which depend on violence, whether
of body or of tongue. I am not at all sure
that for Cherry, quarrels and scoldings,
tragic griefs and clamorous repentances,
don’t all come under the category of games,
so great is her abhorrence of a fife that is
not eventful.
Thus the reader will find here his own
children accurately and amusingly
portrayed, and memories of his own child-
hood springing to mind. He will find that
the total book gives a picture of the
French provincial town where Chevallier
lives. He will find much to enlighten
him about adult as well as childish
behavior, for our own quarrels and
scoldings, tragic griefs and clamorous re-
pentances, our private fights and even our
international wars, also spring partly
from mankind’s abhorrence of a life
that is not eventful.
He will find, too, a book that performs
a valuable service in correcting the im-
pression, fostered by the cheap transla-
tion of The Euffe Inheritance, that
Chevallier is merely a “naughty” author,
like a Thorne Smith or a Linklater: it is
the whole spectacle of life that enchants
him, as the whole of life enchanted
Maupassant.
But when all that has been said he will
not, alas, find a Clochemerle. The book
reads a little like journalism, a set of
essays which Chevallier could have
written for a ’weekly paper ; and Cherry,
though Chevallier must have enjoyed
drawing her at full-length, should really
have found a place only as a minor
character in one of his novels.
Reviewed Briefly.
Frederic Chopin, Son of Poland: Later
Years: Opal Wheeler (Faber). Part Two
of a pleasantly told life of Chopin for
children, copiously illustrated by Christine
Price, and breaking into the easier ex-
tracts from his music every now and
then, so that a child may go from the
book to the piano and play what he or
she has just observed Chopin composing;
moreover, Chopin is shown to have led
an absolutely blameless life. Other books
in the same style, with different illus-
trators, treat of Mozart, Haydn, Bach,
Schubert, Stephen Foster, Beethoven,
Handel, Schumann, Grieg and Brahms.
♦ * * *
Satan Island: Julian Watson (Faber).
The brigadier sells his island off the coast
of Cornwall to a sinister stranger ; his
children, angry at being deprived of their
playground, quarrel with the stranger;
the gardener tells a queer story of Ger-
mans burying looted gold in Crete during
the recent war, and of the part the
sinister stranger had in hijacking the
cache —it all ending in a fierce fight on
the island and the triumph of virtue. For
older children; and includes map of
island.
» * * ♦
The Haunted Reef: Frank Crisp
(Bodley Head). The adventurous crew
of the small Pacific salvage-pearler-trader
motor-lugger Southern Cross pick up a
manacled man adrift on a tree-trunk. In
hospital ashore he whispers “Taratara.
. . . The Haunted Reef” . . . and thither
they go, dogged by the rascally Irish
captain of the steamer Fiafa; there are
exciting diving adventures and astonish-
ing struggles by land and sea before the
heroes get their hands on the diamonds
from the safe of the wreck. For teen-
age boys.
* * * *
Live Bait: Ronald Wills (Wingate).
This mystery of assaults and murdered
boys in an English village is chamber
music to the average detective story’s
vaudeville; an exquisite mind makes its
points with amusing subtlety as, for
instance, when the amateur detective’s
brilliant study of a suspect’s character in
terms of his living-room is blown out by
the simple fact that the house has been
rented as it stands only a few months
ago ; the people are beautifully done;
the conclusion is seen to have been
dropped fairly, point by point, into the
reader’s lap; and no effort is made to
keep the murderer out of view of the
reader. But for lack of the usual
ballyhoo it falls, as a detective story, a
little flat; no detective story can succeed
completely whose detective is not
astonishing in his own right.

a DEAL ON THE BLACK
by C.S. BARY
a f-ORTY MILLION
f— * American dollars,” re-
I cited the cicerone. “But
of course Italy would
never sell.”
“Poppycock,” I said.
“You’re tellin’ me,” nasalised
the Yank.
The marble flesh of Moses
was like smoky ivory. With dust
thick in the creases. His attitude
called for thunderbolts and white
lightning with maybe a couple of
active volcanoes for a backdrop.
He must have gleamed in
Buonarroti’s day, but of late he
had absorbed too much of the
Roman scene,
“They told me his toes had
melted away through centuries
of being kissed,” I said.
“You’re thinking of St.
Peter.”
“Let’s have a drink.”
Outside San Pietro nei Vincoli
you could fry sedame on the
granite paveway. We dropped a
flight of stone steps into Via
Pietro Lazzi; turned into Via dei
Serpenti. Into the first bar. The
sign said “Si parla anche
italiano.”
“How long you been in
Rome?” I said.
“Came in this morning.”
“Accommodate yourselves,”
said Carlo the coffee-cooker.
“Grab a seat,” I translated.
“Just command,” commanded
Carlo.
“What you drink?” I trans-
lated.
“Anise,” said the Yank.
“Capuccino,” I said.
THE Yank’s suit was brand-
new. A national character-
istic. The broad tie flouted a
print of Botticelli’s “Venus”
looking like a refugee from a
1920 penny-peep machine.
He was loving it all. Black
glass table-tops, reading-lamps
set in Ischian sea-shells, feathery,
leathery lounge-seats, green
bottles with-basket\foprk bodices.
From the radio came a male
contralto’s beseechment to
return to Sorrento. In one
corner two dolls were frithing
and tithing over mayonnaise in
long glasses. The murals were
rude nudes in lewd moods. The
Yank’s grin was smooth and
broad like a Los Angeles boule-
vard.
“You alway drink coffee?”
“Teetotaller,” I said.
He hung out a Camel.
“Non-smoker,” I said.
“Let’s invite the sweeties
over.”
“Misogynist,” I said.
“What ?”
“These girls are on the pay-
roll,” I said. “You pay their
bill; they get a cut. They never
order second-best.”
“Why should I complain?”
complained the Yank.
“No return for outlay,” I ad-
vised. “I know. I’ve tried.”
“I only got an hour left. I’m
second mate on the General
Klinkerr, Up the river. We’re
sailing on the tide.”
I stirred the loam in my
painted cup. A second mate. A
Yankee tub. A river. And a tide
to sail on. Did he mean a high
tide to clear the sewerage de-
posits? Or a low tide to get
under those Tiberian bridges?
Well, well. Too hot to think. I
at© some of the coffee. The
Yenus pattern in my eyeballs
lighted up like neon-tubes.
“Don’t do that again!” I said.
“Huh?”
“Pour your anise into my
capuccino.”
“Okay.”
A TAXI stopped outside. A
**■ Roman citizen alighted and
walked in to stand at the bar.
.The taxi waited. The radio im-
plored us in a treble-tenored
tremor to remember Rome. I
felt dyspeptic.
“A buddy from my hometown
works in Rome,” confided the
Yank. “Works for the American
Express Company. The office is
shut today. Sunday. Don’t
know his private address.”
“Bad luck.” I waved for fresh
coffee, “What’s y’r name?”
“Mike.”
“Bad luck, Mike.”
“He asked me to bring some
American cloth material over.
Says he makes profit on it over
here.”
“How much you got?”
“It’s in a jeep round the block.
About enough for twenty suits,”
I looked over at Carlo the
coffee-cooker. He used to buy
my coffee in the old days. Clean
fragrant coffee-beans fresh from
the Swiss Alps. For ravenous
Rome.
But Carlo shook his head at
the question in my mind.
Cautious. And the newcomer
was on his way out. I stopped
him before Mike had a chance.
“Scusi, signor,” I switched to
my Sunday-best Tuscan. “What
hour is it?”
He looked at his watch. He
looked at my watch. I looked
at his watch. Thirty thousand
lire without the gold strap, I
guessed. At least.
“Your clock is correct,” he
said with cynical sibilance. “I
have only five minutes to get to
the football.” He pulled a
thousand-lire gate-pass from his
waistcoat pocket. Ah, yes!
The Milanese Gioventu
against the locals. The match of
the year. How could he push in
at this late hour? Especially
with a ticket already cancelled.
“We have cloth to sell,” I told
him.
Yes, smuggled cloth. Enough
for a long spell of hell in a
smelly cell. But Roman citizens
don't whistle readily for cara-
binieri. Cop-callers in Rome are
as rare as bullfighters in the
Coliseum. Both parties to a
litigation are likely to find them-
selves simultaneously incarcer-
ated. Waiting for the machinery
of the law to develop momentum
is a dreary business. Especially
if the waiting is done in caboosa.
Every turn of the rusty, dusty
legal wheel involves rubber-
stamping and fumbling, inter-
minable interrogations and form-
filling, signing and counter-sign-
ing, cigar-smoking by the wine-
logged carabiniere coloncllo.
Roman justice takes a little
time. A little lifetime.
The newcomer went away. He
opened the taxi door. He closed
the taxi door. He came back.
The taxi waited for the Roman
citizen.
“Where is it?” he asked.
HE was too good. Romantic
black ringlets smearing
his coat collar. Lumpy gold
rings over yellow gloves. Walk-
ing-stick, spats and a two-day
beard. He had an anchor to
hold his tie straight, and an
anchor to anchor the anchor. A
pocketful of aqua di Cologna
competed with a bellyful of
fragrant Italian cooking. Social
approval depended on personal
accoutrements. The bigger the
array, the greater the prestige.
The Yank wiped the dew from
his forehead. His grin was still
sharp and sweet like chilled
Frascati on a midsummer noon.
“I’ll go get the stuff,” he said.
The citizen sat down and
combed the seaweed on his
scalp. Straight back like
Dempsey on fight night Then
he teased it into the seven seas
versus Captain Blood. He wiped
the onion soup off his comb onto
his waistcoat.
The Yank had a package
under each arm, a package
dangling from each paw. The
citizen tor© a hole in one pack-
age. Peeped at the stuff inside.
“I work for the Government”
he told me. “I never buy this
stuff for resale. I only use it
among my relatives.”
“That’s reasonable,” I said.
Twenty relatives. Identically
suited.
“Do you speak English?”
asked the Yank. The citizen
looked worried.
“He says ‘What price?’ ” I
translated. I have battled
through too many do-you-speak-
English routines.
The author at the time of
■writing this story was with an
Australian mission on the
Continent.
The citizen remembered the
football. Impatiently. He was
as anxious to be gone as a Bondi
tram-driver.
“The stuff is worth two
hundred dollars,” said the
Yank.
“One hundred and forty
thousand lire,” I translated. The
Roman citizen fished out his
comb, began cleaning his teeth.
Meticulously. He rMnembered
the football. He put the comb
away.
“I will pay one hundred and
ten thousand,” he declared.
“He’ll pay one hundred
thousand lire,” I translated.
“Okay,” said the Yank. “That
will fetch me some souvenirs
before my ship sails.” Souvenirs
of Rome. The radio switched to
“St. Louis Blues. The Yank
looked nostalgic.
“I will be back at six with the
money,” said the citizen. He
stood up.
“My friend’s ship sails in an
hour,” I said.
The Italian pulled out his
pocket-money. A fairly respect-
able ten-thousand-lire note. Five
limp wom-out thousand-lire
notes. A fistful of grubby small
notes. I held the big notes up to
the light. One by one. This
trick buys a fight in Sydney. In
Rome it earns respect.
“It’s all I have with me,” he
said. “I can get no more until
after the football.”
A HOPELESS pattern. A
sticky Roman Sunday after-
noon. A football game. A
Yankee ship. A heap of cloth.
And a sucker with no cash on
hand,
“Drink an aperitive?” I
offered.
“There is no time,” said the
citizen.
“Need the money now,” I
said. “My friend’s ship is ready
to leave.”
“Ask your friend to leave the
stuff with you,” he told me.
“This evening I will give you the
money and take the stuff.”
I put it into basic English for
Mike’s benefit. Mike twisted his
face about. Trying to look
thoughtful.
“I want some dough right
away,” he said. “Have you got
any with you?”
“Not enough to buy the
cloth,” I said. “I got about forty
thousand.”
The Roman citizen said: “If
you can hold the stuff till this
evening I’ll give you ten
thousand oyer and above/’
“Give me your forty
thousand,” said the Yank, “plus
the fifteen thousand from the
Italian. That will be enough. I’ll
leave the cloth with you and you
can collect the full price for
yourself. This evening.”
Money for nothing. I day-
dreamed through the weeks to
come. “Buy Bianca Neve tooth-
paste,” said the radio, “and save
money on dentists’ bills.”
“Very complicated,” I re-
marked in both languages.
Th© Roman citizen controlled
himself heroically. He examined
his watch. He gesticulated. He
sweated. He examined his
watch. “Nice watch,” I said,
always quick with an idea.
“Santissima vergine!” he
cried. He was overdoing it.
A plangent prowler paddled
past. Peddling. I gave him one
of Mike’s cigarettes. Magnifi-
cently.
“Listen!” said the Italian. “I
am a gentleman. I have no time
to waste,”
An Italian gentleman. I took
a good hard look. Something
the guide-books had missed.
I slipped into four-wheel drive.
“Money now,” I said.
“Senta!” he simmered. “I
give you my fifteen thousand.
You buy the stuff and hold it for
me. This evening I pay you the
full price plus ten thousand for
your trouble.”
Ten thousand lire’s worth of
trouble for an Italian gentleman.
“Va bene,” I said. “Okay.”
A promise for a promise. I
took his fifteen thousand sticky
lire; folded them lovingly.
“You are a gentleman, I trust
you,” 1 he said, writing down my
name and address. He writhed
into the taxi. He was gone. I
grabbed a breath of fresh air.
“My money is back at the
pub,” I said.
“We’ll take a cab,” said the
Yank. *
WE pulled up outside the
Albergo. Five hundred
lire a night. No bathroom,
no service, no what’s-y’r-
game? Nothin’. Only poky
cubicles and grey-sheeted beds,
Mike began scratching
dandruff preparatory to thinking.
“Don’t be glum, chum,” I
soothed. “I won’t be long.”
The padrona was waiting.
Determinedly. Seven days in
Rome and she was still un-
conquered. I felt dejected. Re-
jected.
“Buona sera, bellezza,” I
vocalised. “Figlia delle stelle.”
“Will you be able to pay your
account?” she queried.
I produced fifteen thousand
lire. I paid the account. Scorn-
fully. I studied the railway time-
table. I climbed five forlorn
flights to my square bare room-
let. Blue demons of despair were
consuming me. The future was
frightening. My reaction was
hatred for the present. The push-
ing pilgrims. The carping
tourists. The hilarious solem-
nity.
I packed the valise in two
minutes. A weather-beaten
rucksack, a cheap torch, an
aluminium bottle for cold coffee,
a long pair of Zeiss field-glasses,
ragged wind-jacket, leather
trousers. In the toe of the
mountain-boots was a brittle
thousand-lire note. It broke in
half as I pulled it out. I put both
halves in my pocket.
I thought of the task ahead.
The weeks of walk over rock and
ice. The hours* of anxiety. The
struggle to smuggle. From
Macugnaga across the Alps to
Wisp. You exchange lire for
francs for coflee. You struggle
back, trip after trip, with a sixty-
pound pack, a breaking back
and enough profit to invest in
watches and cigarettes. Then
you/ spend a week in Rome try-
ing to seduce the landlady. Then
you begin again, Alpine smug-
gling offers no fabulous profits.
It saves you from joining Italy’s
five million unemployed.
Dogana patrols are sighted.
Frequently. They are unavoid-
able. Occasionally. They are
unbribable. Ostensibly. The un-
lucky smuggler spends weeks in
a carabiniere clink. Training
cockroaches to race for cigarette
bets. Cigarettes made from dis-
carded butts.
Mike appeared suddenly. Not
unexpectedly.
“Everything under control?”
“Sure,” I said.
“Lousy hotel.”
“Sure.”
Mike looked at his watch. So
many people in a hurry. On a
dreamy steamy Sunday after-
noon.
“I must get aboard,” he said.
“Have you got the dough?”
I knew what was coming. I’m
no fighter.
“No dough,” I said. Not un-
expectedly.
“I’ve gone to a lot of trouble,”
he reproached me.
“Yeah.”
There was hardly room for
two bodies in my roomlet. Two
vertical bodies. The Yank was
pawing me with the grim
joviality of a justifiable
murderer. I sagged and felt
haggard. I concentrated hard
for a frantic half-second. I re-
laxed again. Sat on the bed to
survey the position. A rest
between rounds.
The Yank had forgotten to
fall over. He was ill with a con-
cave midriff. Where my ragged
right had jammed. He was
somewhat transparent about the
gills. Waiting to regurgitate. I
could smell anise.
His eyes were shut. He was
cursing fluidly in neat Neapoli-
tan, He held a knife, blade up-
wards, in one fist. The
vaudeville touch.
I TOOK the knife before his
1 eyes unscrewed. I went down-
stairs for a last pass at the
padrona.
“Ha visto I’americano?” she
inquired.
“He’s no American,” I said. I
grabbed the phone.
“Pronto! ” answered Carlo the
coffee-cooker at the other end.
“How much coffee will you
want next month?” I inquired.
“No coffee, friend,” he said.
“I’ll bring you ten chilo-
grammes,” I begged.
“Five will be enough, friend.”
“What do you know about my
two companions?”
“Two companions, friend?”
“The one who pretends to be
American, and the football
fan?”
“They’ve been working to-
gether for three months,” in-
formed Carlo. “They haven’t
much money.”
I felt somewhat sorry for
them. No capital. Hard-work-
ing shysters deserve success, I
reckon. My watch said fifteen
minutes to catch the train. A
walk along Via Nazionale would
save a twenty-lire bus-fare. I
staggered into the streaming sun-
light

UNION RULE.
The other day some politician spoke of
Australia (potentially, of course) as a
“great industrial base” for supporting the
military cause of the free nations in the
southern hemisphere.
It does not matter to what party the
politician belonged. He might as reason-
ably be of the “Labor” party which, over
the nine years the Curtin and Chifley
Governments spent in office, looked on
indifferently while the unions made a
living corpse of the Glen Davis project
by limiting its shale-oil output to the
minimum which would conceal a public
scandal; or he might belong to
the coalition at present in power which
has decided to close the thing down
rather than tolerate any longer the pre-
tence of a useful activity. With all Aus-
tralian basic industry struggling to keep
going under the dead hand of go-slow,
strikes, political time-serving, and Com-
munist sabotage in the interests of
Moscow’s cold-war, the applauding from
the mouth of any spokesman, from either
side in politics, of Australia’s prospects
of providing the sinews of modern war
for more than about half a day is pure
eyewash.
There isn’t the coal or the steel or the
cement or even the united will to produce
these things sufficiently to satisfy normal
peace-time requirements. The roaring in-
flation of the currency registers primarily
both the shortage of essential goods and
services and the frantic bidding-up of
prices by those who scramble for what is
offered on the market. One Government
after another has been confronted for
years with the sabotage of all coal reserves
(in order that even a one-day strike shall
become a “weapon” in the hands of the
miners’ bosses against the community),
the shamefully slow working of ships in
Australian ports, the tactics of pulling
engineers out of industrial plants (so that
one aggressive union executive can lay
a whole range of shops idle); and all
have seemed powerless to prevent such
things —seemed powerless, because ex-
hibiting no real effort to tackle them.
“An arsenal for democracy! ” What is
it but a bad joke? As for the inflation
resulting, it is the simplest feat for any
rabble-rouser to create indignant demands
that “Menzies must be forced to do some-
thing”—do it all by himself, when those
supposed to be injured by high prices
and short supplies have not the slightest
intention of doing anything themselves,
individually or collectively.
The working year started last week
with the usual display of electric-power
blackouts (worse than ever), stop-work
meetings on the coalfields, bans on over-
time in the ports and engineering-shops
(in “protest against awards”) —all in re-
sumption of the “Labor” conspiracy of
last year to “prevent the Menzies Govern-
ment from governing.” That is the face it
wears in this country in order to serve the
cause of solidarity in the “Labor” party.
Actually the bosses of the unions
chiefly concerned are mostly irreconcilable
Communists, and they are carrying out
Moscow’s orders to sabotage any pre-
paration of the Western democracies (in
which Australia is included) to resist
Moscow’s plans for world dominion.
That Australia should become “a great
industrial base,” an “arsenal for demo-
cracy,” is precisely what this campaign
is directed to prevent. Not one member
of the late Chifley Government, talking
endlessly in mere protests against the
decline of our economic state of health,
ever utters one word against the deliberate
sabotage of useful employment by these
union bosses. It is a principle of
their policy, too, to smash industry under
private enterprise so that Governments
shall have excuse to step in and “nation-
alise” the ruins. Then run all industry—
or let the unions run it —like Glen Davis.
“Labor” has been campaigning with a
loud voice for a return to central price-
control and the pegging of goods-
prices only. It would allow every indus-
try to become a Glen Davis, let wages
rise and hours of work fall to any levels
the unions consent to accept, and permit
consolidated revenue to be devoted to the
purpose of “keeping national industry
going.” It would allow unions, in short,
to govern the country. All our Com-
munist “traitors” (Chifley Ministers’
description of them in 1949) are devoted
to that objective. There would be no
fighting services.
It would be a change to see some
organisation of public opinion, in suffi-
cient strength to convince any Common-
wealth Government which may be elected
to power, that the mass of Australian
people have had enough of this sort of
stuff. The Menzies Government has
had due allowance made it for the
truly enormous handicap it has had to
carry during the first year, now elapsed,
of this 19th Parliament. Its defeated
political opponents left the ground strewn
with mines and booby-traps, and there
was little hope earlier of breaking through
the obstacles which the vanquished had,
with due forethought against defeat,
erected in the Senate. But what is tradi-
tionally the effective working period of a
three-year Parliament has now begun,
and in this middle-term the Government
must come to grips with its job or confess
itself a failure.
Glen Davis is only by accident
the test upon which the Government’s
authority and resource must be proved.
The first test might have been found
on the coalfields or on the wharves or in
the strangled shipping services, all of
which are manifestly impatient to set
the ball rolling. The union bosses are
anxious to show how important to our
economy are even a few drums of
basic spirit from Glen Davis in such a
national emergency, when all the ships
in all the ports are growing barnacles
and the railway-tracks are (like those
of Victoria for eight weeks this summer)
covered by high grass. The threat of
unemployment is no longer a “weapon
of the employer” ; it has become the
weapon of the union boss.
During four post-war years the Chifley
Government submitted to every form of
blackmail from the bosses of the key
unions—and especially from the miners’
executive—on the ground that any price
was worth paying by a “Labor” Govern-
ment to avoid a general strike. And any
price asked was duly paid, though in the
end it did not save Chifley and Co.
The Chifley Government’s long and
shameful toleration of defiance by union
bosses of its own authority, the Arbitra-
tion Court and the union’s own pledges
went for nothing towards saving “Labor’s”
political skin. Its well-advertised dis-
position to avoid “provoking a strike” at
all costs was a clear signal to every union
to go its hardest.
But there is no need for the Menzies
Government to follow suit. It has to
find means to cure this intolerable usurpa-
tion of authority by the unions. The
public does not yet appreciate everywhere
the essential issue in the Glen Davis
decision. Ministers had not the wit to
present their case adequately in the first
instance.
Every citizen watching his children
growing up should take to heart a couple
of simple reflections. He might ask him-
self what friendly Power abroad is going
to be interested in protecting a White Aus-
tralia for slackers, and what is going to
save our cockeyed ideas of industrial con-
ditions when the Japs and the Germans
come back into competition in the world’s
markets and the sea-carrying trade. These
questions are fundamentals not for the
dim future, but for today.
Appeasing a Dragon.
If the reported decision that the U.N.O.
side is to stay and fight on in Korea
represents high policy, it might well be
hoped that more thought has been given
to it than was evidently given to earlier
decisions in the same quarter. There
might also be the hope that the decision
is backed by something more like work-
ing unanimity than has been seen
hitherto.
The first decision to go in at all and
fight in Korea might perhaps be labelled
wholly emotional. More precisely,
American emotionalism. That Korea
had been “given away” by U.S. policy-
makers is freely admitted. The actual
state of things on both sides of the arti-
ficial boundary-line was quite well
known. Official U.S. statements had fre-
quently protested against the Soviet
arming of the North Koreans. U.S.
“intelligence,” lately the scapegoat, was
not at fault there; the North Korean
strength was as good as public property.
Moreover, neither the U.S. policy-
makers nor anybody else had any
illusions about the comparative weakness
in the South. The Americans had with-
drawn altogether from Korea, and more
than one subsequent U.S. official an-
nouncement could only be interpreted as
giving the Soviet-prepared North Koreans
advance notice that if they now attacked
they would have only the South Koreans
to fight. Yet, when in due course thgy
did attack, it was hastily decided hy the
U.S., hastily backed by U.N.0., to reverse
all this and go in and oppose them.
Why? The answer, of course, lies in
earlier history. For years a particular
line of pure assumption had been so
shouted from the housetops of the
pundits that the fact that it was assump-
tion had long been forgotten and it had
passed into common currency as an
article of faith. Ironically, it was in the
first instance an American assumption:
that if the Japs had been opposed when
they went into Manchuria (as State
Secretary Stimson wished and execrated
Britain opposed), the course of history
would have been different; meaning that
the Japs would have either caved in or
been licked, and so there would have
been no third partner in the Axis, no
Pearl Harbor, etc., etc.
Similarly, Mussolini in Abyssinia ; ditto
Hitler in the Rhineland or in Austria.
Like the Japs, in the assumption, both
Mussolini and Hitler, on the same
reckoning, would have either caved in or
taken a hiding ; and so there would have
been no Munich —a name which, by the
force of all the subsequent hindsight
propaganda based on the sheer assump-
tion, has meanwhile passed into the
language as a synonym for craven
appeasement with disastrous conse-
quences.
There is not, of course, and never has
been, anything stronger than assumption
in all this. Yet it, and apparently nothing
else, caused the evident sweeping reversal
of American —and not only American —
policy on Korea when the long-expected
invasion from the North duly happened.
In the line of reasoning on that mythical
foundation the invasion of South Korea
was the prelude to a series of similar
aggressions. The tablerappers—if not
substituting for the high-policy makers,
at any rate decisively influencing them —
conjured up the ghosts of Manchuria, of
Abyssinia and Austria, and the dreadful
ghost of Munich. And so completely had
the assumption become an article of faith
that the decision to go in and fight was
practically unavoidable.
It is as well to recall now that only
recently prevailing mood ; a mood by no
means confined to America, It is as
well to consider the outcry there would
have been if no action at all had been
been taken. It is as well to remember
what joy there was in the camp while
things were going well, to the apparent
complete justification of the pundits who
for years had made such voluble capital
out of the Munich assumption and its
forerunners. Also, it is as well to
remember that something over 50 U.N.O.
member-nations endorsed the American
policy which had sprouted up overnight,
and supported (vocally, at any rate) the
proposed action. And perhaps, in the
light of what has happened since, with
enthusiasm a major casualty, it may be
as well to remember that the decision
to advance into North Korea, so bitterly
criticised since, was British-sponsored.
Above all, it seems necessary to keep
in mind that the activating notion all
through has been the acceptance of an
assumption as gospel: the belief that a
show of force against deliberate aggres-
sion would surely prevent that aggression
leading to other aggressions leading to
world war. It has not worked out that
way at all. Indeed the very opposite
might well be the outcome: the action
based on the assumption that it would
stay aggression and prevent world war
may itself turn out to have been the fuse
leading on to World War 111.
Obviously something went wrong with
the entire assumption-structure in this
case. The hunt for scapegoats has natur-
ally followed, with General MacArthur
and his “intelligence” the targets for a
lively barrage of rocks hurled with special
fervor by some of MacArthur’s own.
countrymen. The real facts of the tactical
side of the disastrous retreat from the
apparent threshhold of victory may
require time to transpire. In any case,
what really went wrong may go deeper
and have a much more ominous signi-
ficance.
It may be that at the time the
first action against aggression was decided
on, the promise the action seemed to hold
out was as good as the cause itself. The
delayed Chinese Communist entry into
the battle, under Russian direction, might
well have been a result of what the U.S.-
cwm-U.N.O. action had all too plainly
revealed; (1) the real division of outlook
on the Western side (made evident both
by the unwillingness of the U.N.O.
members to back up their high words
with fighting forces and by the pious
hopes uttered by, among others, Attlee
Ministers, that Americans would not get
“bogged down in the Far East”); and
(2) tire real extent of American and
general Western unpreparedness.
Whatever the explanation for the
Chinese delay, followed by the all-out
Chinese aggression, both the division of
outlook and the unpreparedness are still
present. More, they are now giving rise
to trends which could make the worst
that might happen in Korea seem
insignificant. On the one hand, there is
in America a very strong trend indeed
towards isolation; on the other, there is
an equally strong trend noticeable in
Europe, and especially in Britain, in the
direction of appeasing Communist
China practically to the limit of its de-
mands rather than that there should be
any weakening of Europe’s defences —or,
in plainer language, of America’s
strength to defend Europe.
What the Chinese Communists now ask
as appeasement is simply the withdrawal
of all “foreign” troops from Korea, the
abandoning of the U.S. protection of
Formosa, and the admission of Com-
munist China t.o the United Nations.
The breadth of cleavage in the Western
side is indicated by the fact that not one
of these lines of appeasement appeals to
America, while all of them have strong
advocates on the other side of the
Atlantic. At least, such an appeasement
of the Dragon would substitute Korea
for Munich as a byword, with Indo-
China and Hong Kong and possibly
Malaya to follow as Dragon-food,
The American isolationist trend or
the trend in Europe, including Britain,
in the direction of China appeasement
are best read in the representative Press of
both sides of the Atlantic. In America
it has been reported that 40 out of
every 50 of the huge volume of letters
lately pouring in on Congressmen from
all parts of the country favor the Hoover
prescription of “armed isolation.” In
Britain is evident, in papers like the
London “Observer,” an increasing
advocacy of what is glibly called the
“abandonment of places of weakness,”
as contrary to the Acheson doctrine of
the “creation of situations of strength.”
And, moreover, they do not boggle at
adding Indo-China, Hong Kong and the
rest to Korea as all “expendable/’
Where Australia comes into this
eagerness to appease the Dragon may be
hard to see; but it should not be hard
to see how important to this country is
its support of an American policy of
U.S. strength in the Pacific.
Socialism to Open Fire.
With a note of obvious, if somewhat ill-
founded, joy in his voice, K. E. Bardolph,
the Adelaide M.L.C. who is also S.A.
president of the A.L.P., announced last
week that Senator McKenna would
“officially open the Labor party’s
campaign against rising prices in the
Labor ring at the Botanic Park on
February 25.”
It is, of course, an early opening of
“Labor’s” 1952 election campaign. Or
are the boys scared? Do they fear that
Menzies will come back from London
determined to force a double-dissolution
on either the Commonwealth Bank bill
or compulsory military training? Or
rather, do they fear that their bosses, the
A.L.P. Executive, won’t let them climb
down over both bills as they did over the
anti-Red bill?
Whatever the reason, Adelaide is
unlikely to flock to hear a speaker, even
of Senator McKenna’s quality, advocate
such a weak cause. By “campaign against
rising prices” is obviously meant urging
the Federal Government to reimpose
price-control, which it can’t do unless the
people grant the power by referendum or
the States unanimously delegate their
powers over prices. The States are by no
means unanimous about that, despite
“Labor” propaganda. And Senator
McKenna won’t find it easy to persuade
“the workers” that wage-pegging must
accompany price-control or the thing
wouldn’t work, that’s if he allows such
a dreadful word as wage-pegging to
sneak into his discourse.
In any case the position was pretty
clearly summed up by Mr. Spender the
other week: —
Controlling the lives of people won’t
give us greater production... .There must
be greater efficiency in business manage-
ment and greater production by individual
workmen I was not elected to impose,
under this or that pretence, socialistic con-
trols upon a free people or to put our
economy in a straitjacket Underpro-
duction can only be cused by overpro-
duction. Controls have in the end precisely
the opposite effect There is a prime
necessity for the most careful scrutiny by all
State Governments as well as the Federal
Government of moneys being spent on
capital works There is no easy answer
to the inflationary problem.
Federal “Labor” doesn’t really believe
that price-control is an “easy answer.”
What it does believe is that Socialism is
the complete answer, for under Socialism
only the Socialist Government and its
bureaucracy would rule, the people
would have no rights as to choice,of
employment or business and, before
long, not even the right of criticism.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Industrial Paralysis.
Strikes or one-day stoppages to reduce
output of necessities and disrupt industry
were foreshadowed towards last week-
end from half-a-dozen Communist-bossed
executives of key unions. For good
measure Communist O’Shea’s Melbourne
trams began stopping again.
The whole cause of the power-crisis in
all States, it should never be forgotten, is
that there are no coal reserves with any
industry, transport, power or fuel service
because the miners’ bosses won’t permit
any. The policy is to call the weather, as
it serves, into conspiracy with them to cut
off supplies by preventing the stocking of
any reserves anywhere. National-defence
stocking is specially barred, by orders
from Moscow.
The coal stoppage for 24 hours last
week on top of the bad weather nearly
blotted out Sydney power-houses com-
pletely and led to a threat of gas-ration-
ing. Pluming themselves on this success,
the miners’ bosses announced plans for
a one-day stoppage every week. This is
in protest against the Coal Tribunal’s
award requiring the working of the full
five shifts a week in order to qualify for
an extra £1 a week to wage-workers. Last
week the B.H.P. steelworks and associated
industries, which had already dismissed
700 employees, represented that 10,000
more were likely to lose their jobs be-
cause coal was denied to the works.
The A.E.U., which Communist Rowe
has made notorious in the postwar years,
was annoyed by the steps which had to
be taken to collect compulsorily two fines
of £5OO each imposed by the N.S.W, In-
dustrial Commission for a stoppage in
breach of award at A. & I. Steel works.
Last week the A.E.U. executive ordered
another 24-hour stoppage, the Kembla
branch of Communist McPhillips’s iron-
workers joined in, and fresh summonses
were issued against both unions.
About 5000 A.E.U. members in
Sydney, to their credit, did not obey the
stoppage order. Of the 14,000 who did
stop some 5000 attended a meeting and
carried a dictated motion banning over-
time if there were any more “attacks on
the union” by the law.
Communist Roach’s wharf union has
for a fortnight had an executive-planned
ban on overtime ready to launch. It is
calculated to congest every port, and the
balloon is announced to go up early in
February. Every shipping company
knows that Communist Elliott for the
seamen has foreshadowed a widespread
shipping strike soon.
If any Australian wants to know why
all this has to happen the answer is that
the W.F.T.U., industrial organ of
Moscow’s Cominform, was instructed at
the recent Warsaw “peace” conference
(the one which Healy, Mrs. Jessie Street
and other local Reds attended at the price
of having their passports cancelled) “to
start a series of extraordinary claims on
wages and conditions throughout the
capitalist world” and “to link their de-
mands with the struggle for peace”
(British cable reports last week).
It is certainly time, as a spokesman for
the Commonwealth Government said at
the weekend, that the Government should
be “prepared to take a firm stand.” The
firmer and the quicker, the better.
Floods, Fires and Frauds.
Fifty years of Federation were cele-
brated with floods, fires and frauds in
Queensland. All central and northern
Queensland was swamped with monsoonal
rains, the south-west was ablaze with
bushfires last week, and the capital is
still shaken over the Bulimba election
fraud.
The sugar-country on the coast and the
sheep-country behind it were swept by
cyclones and floods that tore hundreds
of thousands of tons of cane from the
ground, drowned thousands of sheep,
marooned towns, ruined roads and rail-
ways and bridges and caused damage con-
servatively estimated at £4,000,000. In
the south-west thousands of acres are
burnt black.
In Brisbane political storms centred
round Bulimba. Queenslanders are
used to rows over roll-stuffing and
other election peculiarities, but Bulimba
was something more. Justice Mans-
field found there had been fraud,
and that Gardner, the “Labor” man who
won the seat by 42 over his Liberal and
Independent opponents on the first-past-
the-post system, owed his victory to it,
though himself not implicated. Gardner
then said the judge couldn’t count.
Morris, Liberal deputy-leader, called this
an insult to the judge. Gardner then held
that the election was not declared void
because of election frauds, though he
didn’t say why it had been declared void.
The election was declared void on January
2 ; on January 17 Mr. Speaker Mann had
not declared Bulimba vacant.
Last Thursday Premier Hanlon said
Parliament “would not decide until
March whether the Bulimba seat would
be declared vacant.” This means that
Gardner, though his election was declared
void by the judge, will continue drawing
his £3O a week until then, and take his
seat as a member when the Parliament
meets.
It reminded Queenslanders of Premier
Hanlon’s worries in 1938, when the
Premier had almost as much trouble in
winning his electoral kingdom of Ithaca
as had Ulysses of old in regaining his
Ithaca. That election was declared void.
Mr. Hanlon appealed to the Full Court,
which de-voided it, and this was upheld
when, on appeal, the High Court of Aus-
tralia declared Ulysses—sorry, the Premier
—duly elected.
Mr, Dunstan, “Labor” member for
Nash, must be watching all this with deep
attention, for his majority was but 25
and his election, too, is to be tested in
the courts. It all arises out of the sus-
picious “Labor” business of abolishing
preferential voting and using doubtful
State roils instead of the Federal rolls,
processes which, with seat-“redistribu-
tion,” gave the Hanlons a majority of
seats on a minority of votes.
The "Indernesian Comrades 8 '
Holland’s last Lieutenant-Governor in
N.E.1., Dr. Van Mook, who had a gruel-
ling post-war job in Indonesia —one made
much harder by the Chifley Govern-'
ment’s support of the Japanese enemy’s
ex-collaborator Soekamo —has at length
broken his silence in a book published in
London, The Stakes of Democracy in
S.-E. Asia. He shows great sympathy
with Indonesia’s case (he was himself
born in Java), and desired only to pave
by reasonable steps (for sake of
minorities) the way to independence. He
asks bluntly: “Was it need for the Com-
munist vote or" fear of Asia’s hordes that
made Australia so hostile to the Dutch?”
No reply need be expected from Dr.
Evatt or Soekamo’s friend’s friend, Mr.
Chifley.
In these post-Chifiey days, having got
all they wanted against the Dutch out of
the Chifley crowd’s sponsorship of “our
Indernesian comrades” on the U.N.O.
Good Offices Committee, Soekarno and
Co. now decline to submit their Dutch
New Guinea claim to the U-N. com-
mittee “because our representative on
that body is Australia.” That is one
overseas jobholder Percy Spender might
recall by urgent cable. He can no longer
have any “good-office” work to do.
Life and a Comma.
On Friday, January 12, the captain of
the migrant ship Liguria radioed Fre-
mantle that one engine had broken down
and the ship’s position was “precarious”
in heavy seas about 450 miles north-west
of the port. The ship was carrying 950
migrants and a crew of about 250. The
message asked for tugs to take the vessel
in tow. That night came a second
message, “Tug necessary immediately,”
The ship barely had steerage-way in
heavy seas.
At once action was taken to send the
tug Uco to the rescue. Extra crew, gear
and stores were got together, a volunteer
band of 15 Fremantle wharflurapers began
loading coal into the tug. At this stage,
apparently, none of the crew thought
about pay—decent unionists never do
when there is an emergency with life at
stake.
Normal rates for tug crews is about
£2 a day, with 7s. 6d. an hour overtime
and Bs. Bld. double time. On the Satur-
day morning appeared P. L. Troy, Com-
munist secretary of the Dock, River and
Harbor Workers’ Union. He demanded
£l2 a day, with Bs. an hour for time
worked over eight hours a day. The tug-
owners offered £5 a day and 12s. 6d.
overtime, which had been paid previously
for salvage jobs.
Over 400 miles away the Liguria rolled
in the big seas, her officers trying to calm
the frightened passengers, while this
haggling went on. The thing was
hurriedly referred to the W-A. Industrial
Registrar, who said the owner’s offer was
a fair thing. Troy called the crew
together, spoke to them, went back and
said the tug wouldn’t budge unless the
men got £8 a day and £1 overtime. The
owners offered £6 10s. and overtime, Troy
then demanded £7.
By this time nearly 24 hours had
passed since the Liguria had called for
help. Troy, denied the £7, pulled the tug
crew “out.” The wharfies on the coal
heard of this, and, having worked like
beavers to get the coal aboard, lost their
tempers and damned the tug crew heartily,
reminding them that it was an emergency
and could end fatally. But the dog
showed his teeth at the sheep and they
crouched fearfully in their comer.
Meantime the Liguria’s Fremantle
agent had made radio contact with a
British freighter, the Chandpara. With
no arguments about pay she promptly
changed her course and made all speed
to the crippled vessel, reached her early
on Sunday morning and had a line aboard
a few hours later. The two then began
the tow to Fremantle, reaching there on
Wednesday, five days after the first call
for help went out.
For the people of the Liguria it must
have been a great thing when the Chand-
para hove in sight and an even greater
thing when they were safe in Fremantle.
All Fremantle was relieved to see them.
As for the Communist cause of all the
concern, in typical Communist style he
changed the tune, finally alleging that the
Uco was unfit for sea, that she “had her
hull plugged with pieces of broomhandle”
and was holed in her forepeak tanks. The
Uco’s crew might reflect that if that were
really so Troy should never have
bargained about pay to start with; he
should have refused to allow them to
put to sea at all.
Conservation, Is It?
Over in Wellington (N.Z.) the city
council is about to plant out 25,000 trees
from its nurseries into parks, reserves and
streets. In Queenstown (Q.) a citizen
named Francis Stomer, who died some
months ago, has left £6OOO to the local
council to be used in beautifying the
town, mainly by tree-planting and teach-
ing children to respect and care for trees.
In other parts of this Commonweatlh
people are trying to preserve existing trees
and plant more, and some progress has
been made in breaking down the old Aus-
tralian instinct to grab an axe and go for
the nearest tree.
Government departments, however,
apparently still regard trees as objects to
be got rid of as ruthlessly as possible.
Near Junee the P.M.G.’s Department
found a lot of trees on the route of a
telephone-line and promptly proceeded
to cut them down, deaf to the indigna-
tion of local residents who offered to let
the line run across their properties rather
than see the trees go.
The limit was recently reached, A
beauty-spot known as Muogamarra,
about 30 miles north of Sydney and over-
looking the Hawkesbury River, has been
preserved for years by public subscrip-
tion and the devoted care of a small
society formed to look after it. It had
been stringently guarded against fire and
wildflower vandals, and has attained a
minor fame among local and overseas
tourists. This time the axe was wielded
by the N.S.W. Government Railways,
which chopped down native trees in
the sanctuary because it wanted to run a
power-line over them.
Minister for Transport Sheahan said
something about making inquiries,
possibly into the question of whether or
not the power-line could have avoided
the trees. But not a word has come from
the responsible Minister about either the
Junee or Muogamaira acts —he is Mr.
Weir, the N.S.W. Minister for Conserva-
tion. As such he ought to be consulted
before any public body takes the axe to
a tree. Maybe they don’t take him
seriously.
The Wren Case.
Victorian Supreme and then Full Court
having in turn upheld Magistrate Jack-
son’s competence to hear the action for
criminal libel brought on the information
of Ellen Wren, wife of John Wren, against
Francis Joseph Hardy, the hearing was
resumed in Melbourne City Court last
week. It began on October 26 last and
was interrupted on objection to the
magistrate’s jurisdiction.
The information is founded on extracts from
Hardy’s book Power Without Glory. Informant
claims that the author meant and is under-
stood to mean
That Mrs. Wren had committed adultery
and had an illegitimate child named
Xavier:
That she had seduced a married man;
and
That she had falsely represented herself
as, or allowed herself to be represented as,
the wife of the man concerned.
Various witnesses for Mrs. Wren said they
had identified characters in the book—which
they said purported to be a record of activities
and associations of John Wren —including:
Nellie West (Ellen Wren), “Snoopy” Tanner
(late “Squizzy” Taylor), Lou Darby (late Les
Darcy, boxer), Archbishop Malone (Archbishop
Mannix), “Red Ted” Thurgood (late E. G.
Theodore), and a whole gallery of Victorian
“Labor” politicians (many of them dead or
retired), including among those living Carr
(ex-Premier Cain, M.L.A.), Kiely (Keon, M.P.)
and Kelleher (Kennelly, M.L.C.).
Preliminary addresses and intervals in the
hearing were marked by heated disputes between
counsel (Campbell, K.C., for Hardy and
Galbally, M.L.C., for Mrs. Wren), especially on
points whether Ellen Wren was bringing the
action on behalf of John Wren and whether
she was coerced into doing so, on both of which
the magistrate ruled against defendant.
First witness, John Francis Wren (son), said
in evidence he believed leading names in the
book meant those of his mother and father.
Among details of identification was a heavy
upholstered chair (brought into court) bearing
a heraldic crest with an inscription in Gaelic
of which he understood the “rough translation”
to be “Wren to Victory,” a detail described in
one passage of the book, but with translation
as “West for Victory.”
Witness said he and his father decided his
mother should bring the action because the
references to her were the grossest libel in the
hook.
Mr, Campbell: Not because then the defence
of truth and public benefit could not be raised
—‘To the best of my recollection, no.
Has your father read the book? —No.
Has your mother read it? —She read it and
burnt it. She hid it when not actually reading
it. #
Did she tell your father she had read it? —-
Not until three or four weeks before the
criminal libel charge was laid.
Witness said his father had had extracts from
the book sent him through the post before
publication. His father “rippled through a few
pages” and threw them away, without reading.
With the extracts from the book sent to his
father came “a demand for £100,000.” His
father said he would never submit to blackmail
(blackmail references ordered by magistrate to
be struck out of the court report). He told
his father of descriptions in the book of West
as “directly or indirectly connected with two
murders,” “connected in a nefarious manner
with the Milk Commission and the ringing-in
of racehorses,” and that “before he started his
tote he had rigged a pigeon race.”
Mr. Campbell: You told your father of
these allegations, and still he did not read the
book? —He still did not read the book.
Witness identified “Snoopy Tanner” with
“Squizzy” Taylor, “a known convicted
criminal.” His father had not been associated
with Taylor, but knew him to the extent of
ordering him off the racecourse. Mr. Campbell
then read a long passage from the book describ-
ing how Tanner had threatened to murder John
West, apd “Arty” West (alleged to be Arthur
Wren) had “advised his brother to get in first,”
whereafter “John West sat thoughtfully for a
while caressing his revolver.” Then “a plan
crystallised in John West’s mind” There
followed, in the reading, the story of a night
raid on the house of “Slasher Cutting”
(identified by witness with “Snowy Cutmore, a
Melbourne criminal”) by Tanner and “the big
man,” ending with gunshots; of Tanner emerg-
ing and trailing blood and getting himself into
a taxi, but “dead when he reached hospital”;
of Cutting’s corpse found in the house with
its brains blown out on the wall, and his old
mother saying “the big man shot both of
them.” Witness said he had read this. He
had also read in the book that Tanner had been
employed by West, that West ran politicians
and that West had used Tanner’s gang to
terrorise political opponents.
Mr. Campbell: The allegation in the book is
that your father instigated a particularly
foul and horrible murder? —Yes.
Do you agree that the book presents your
mother as a good woman driven to adultery by
the conduct of her husband? —Yes.
Do you say that the libel of her adultery is
grosser than the libel that your father instigated
the murder of “Squizzy” Taylor?—Yes.
Witness having denied in answer to further
questions that his father had abstained from
laying the information “because he feared that
if he did so his political activities with certain
politicians might suffer from the publicity,” he
was ordered to leave the court while counsel
wrangled over the point, which Mr. Galbally de-
clared to be “a matter of scandal.”
Witness (recalled) then said he regarded
descriptions of an interview in th 6 book
between West and Lou Darby, in which West
threatened that Darby would get no more fights
unless he joined the Army, as one of several
“embellishments on half-truths.” The incidents
affecting Lou Darby did not confirm his view
that West was identical with Wren. Other
passages were read to witness describing
West’s “corrupting influence in the Parlia-
ments,” and an interview with Archbishop
“Malone.”
“The politicians were mainly Labor men,
but he added quite a few Country-party
and Nationalists to the ranks of West
men In pre-selection ballots for safe
Labor seats his men were always active.
They had developed some interesting
techniques. Their motto was vote early
and vote often.”
Witness said these passages did not help him
identify West with his father, nor did an-
other passage declaring that Mr. Kiely alleged
in Parliament that “West helped defeat the
Carr Government” and that “when Sir Alfred
Davison was Premier he called on West every
day,” and that West financed the Country
party. “Mr. Kiely” he identified with Mr.
Keon, then M.L.A. in Victoria, now member of
the House of Representatives, and “Davison
with the late Sir Albert Dunstan of the Country
party. His father had challenged Keon in the
Press to substantiate the allegation that he had
given money to the Country party.
Next witness was Bernard Nolan, a solicitor.
He said he had known John Wren 30 years and
Mrs. Wren 26 years. He had visited the family
once a week throughout that time and tod
regularly gone with Wren to the Stadium. He
had acted for Mr. and Mrs. Wren in a pro-
fessional capacity, and one of their sons,
Joseph Wren, was a solicitor h ™:
He identified West in the book with Wren be
cause he was described as extremely bow-legged,
did not smoke or drink or spend money on
girls, and once wrote a chequefor fSOOforhe
poor, and another time gave £SW to the first
Australian V.C. At variousi stages in hr
career (said witness) Wren owned five race-
SSSU ( . long . feaso of "S

SS caH in Sydney and a °‘
houses, and was once what we caff an S.P.
b °WitaS r said what he meant when he said he
would like to be locked up with Hardy for a
Couple of hours was that he would probably
“kick him to pieces.” He amended an earlier
statement and admitted that he and Wren tod

CARRERAS LIMITED - OVER 150 YEARS REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
discussed the question of Wren’s taking action
for libel, but insisted that Wren had not read
the book. He did not believe Wren was running
“his own men” for Parliament, but Wren had
told him that he had paid the expenses of
candidates. , ~
Patrick Cody, wine and spirit merchant, said
he had known the Wrens for 50 years, and
used to drive Wren home from the city in the
evening and used to gb with Wren to the
stadium. He agreed that the book “as a
whole” portrayed Nellie West as a good woman,
fond of her home and children. He and Wren
were engaged in the distilling industry, but did
not control it, also in the yeast industry,
and he and Wren and the late E. G. Theodore
were associated in Fiji goldmines.
Witness said he was interested in racing and
had owned racehorses. He was interested in Mr.
Wren’s horse Murmur, winner of the 1904
Caulfield Cup. Mr. Campbell then read a pas-
sage from the book in which West’s horse
Whisper was successful in the race, also conver-
sations between West and “Sugar” Renfrey as
they watch the race, in which West explains
that the horse Gladstone is making its run early
according to the plan he had instructed. Wit-
ness said he had not discussed with Wren the
implication that Wren had rigged the 1904 race.
Several witnesses—a University student, a
journalist and two police-detectives—gave
evidence of public addresses by Hardy in which
he had said that he did not accept libel laws,
that the book was an attempt to do a social
benefit; and, this at a Yarra-bank Communist
meeting, he was proud to be a Communist and
had written the book “under the law ot
Marxism.”
The case for the defence is to open tomorrow
(Thursday).
POLITICAL POINTS
Menzies caught a dose of the influenza
raging in Britain, but kept his engage-
ments in spite of it, and has now been
ordered to rest from “public engage-
ments” before coming home. At 56 a
man can’t lead a strenuous political
career and expect to throw off illness
lightly. Chifley discovered that (he’s nine
years older) after enduring a long illness
caused as much by overwork as anything
else. The two wijl be able to talk about
their doctors —if nothing else —when
Canberra opens for business again.
Michael Stewart, the British Under-
secretary for War, said the U.S.A. must
be told that Britain won’t support any
“wild, reckless or provocative action.”
Britain has to make clear to the Russian
and Chinese Governments that she is will-
ing to be friends on honorable and equal
terms.
It must have made fine reading for the
Dominion Prime Ministers in London at
the time to see what could be done about
British Empire unity and co-operation
with the Americans. But then, scratch a
Socialist and you never fihd a realist,
McGirr assured the N.S.W. people at
Christmas that they were in “the dawn
of a new era.” Then the N.S.W. coalies
returned to work from their holidays,
promptly went on strike and the dawn
became more like a midnight fog at
Bankstown,
Dr. Evatt, in his “reply” to Mr.
Spender on the latter’s newspaper article
on inflation, is reported by a Melbourne
paper as saying “Australians could not
increase production if their will to do so
were being sapped by a daily decline in
their earnings and savings.” There is no
decline in their earnings—wages keep on
increasing and the Commonwealth
Statistician keeps on reporting increased
savings-bank deposits. Dr. Evatt calls
that “a drift in our living standards.”
But production is not increasing.
Melbourne has had an electricity black-
out as a premonition of the coming
winter. It has had others. There was a
blackout of fresh meat for three and a
half days at Christmas, and two and a
half days at New Year. After housewives
had struggled through that they were
faced with the butchers’ annual picnic, a
jamboree at Diamond Creek, where there
was no blackout on the beer. Meat used
to be delivered twice daily in Melbourne,
on six days a week. That was in the first
year of Federation, the Jubilee of which
is now being celebrated. It sounds like
some distant heaven,
A body in Sydney calling itself the
War Gratuity Increase Committee, which
is out for a 50 p.c. increase in war
gratuities, has “challenged” Mr. Fadden
to deny its claims at a meeting tonight.
Speakers: Clive Evatt, Rev. Van Eerde,
R. E. Simmons, E. J. Ward (good old
Eddie) and R. E. Wellard (Postal
Workers’ Union). A typical bunch. Lud
Mayor O’Dea and State Attorney-
General Martin, whose names head the
list of “patrons” of the outfit, ought to
be more particular.
Three State “Labor” Governments (in-
cluding the “Labor”-nursed McDonald
outfit in Melbourne as one) have rejected
the Commonwealth Government’s
hospital - finance scheme for increased
Federal subsidies. Any sane man would
think the hospitals were too hard up to
look any gift horse in the mouth, especi-
ally one as good as this; but no, the
"Labor” Ministers who speak for those
hospitals are outraged at the bare idea
of encouraging citizens to pay 6d. a week
to a hospital fund to insure themselves
and their hospitals.
Last June shipping-freight rates on
Australian wheat to the U.K., Egypt and
Italy were 625. 6d. to 655. sterling a ton.
By December they were 87s. 6d, Three
weeks ago they were 110 s. to 1205., and a
week ago ships were being chartered by
the Australian Wheat Board at 1455. to
150 s. This makes about 4s. lOd. a bushel
to take wheat to U.K. and Mediterranean
ports. The buyers have to pay it, but
how long they will continue paying 18s.
a bushel to the growers under those con-
ditions is another matter.
If a public servant can blush there
must be a lot of red faces in Victorian
Premier McDonald’s department. His
officers circularised Victorian country
publicans as to what accommodation they
could provide for the 80 persons who
would accompany the Centenary Jubilee
train tour. When only a few replies came
in the Government chaps made loud
noises to the Press about publicans’ dis-
courtesy and lack of interest in historic
affairs and so forth, and the Govern-
ment ordered a police inquiry on coun-
try pubs generally. Then the Premier’s
Department staff came back from holi-
days and found in a drawer letters from
practically every publican in the bush
offering accommodation or giving rea-
sons why it couldn’t be managed. At
last report the Government typistes were
working overtime sending out letters of
apology. But the average country pub-
lican isn’t so easily mollified when he’s
been publicly accused of what the Vic-
torian Government accused him,
Melbourne “Argus,” to whom the wish
could be father to the thought, claims
that once again the Victorian Liberals
are about to displace Hollway as leader.
Tovell, former Minister for Education, is
one tip for the throne; the “Argus”
seems to favor Norman, “regarded for
some time as a potential leader.” Holl-
way wasn’t downcast when last seen.
Calwell, becoming more politically
cockeyed than ever, declares that Earle
Page’s hospital scheme —it has the
merit of putting first things first, which
“Labor” doesn’t understand at all —
“will take more value out of the pound”
because, he says, under the Chifley scheme
everybody “could have gone entirely free
to public wards in any public hospital,”
whereas now patients will be expected to
pay 6d. a week (a mere tramfare) to a
hospital fund if hospitals are to get the
benefit of a higher Federal subsidy. This
naturally seems terrible heresy to such
Socialists as Calwell, who affect to believe
that nobody ought to be asked to pay even
the smallest sum for anything.
Two months ago the Riverside coal-
mines in Queensland stopped when Millar,
Communist-boss of Queensland Colliery
Employees’ Union, pulled the miners out
because two “roperiders” were given jobs
on the coal face. Chairman Murray, of
the Coal Reference Board, ordered them
back on pain of losing holiday pay and
sick-leave credits. They refused. Settle-
ment was eventually reached on the dis-
pute over the two miners. Then Millar
announced the mine wouldn’t work till
the C.R.B. restored the holiday pay and
sick-leave credits: That’s the way the
Communist plan keeps the coal under-
ground.
The retiring Queensland president of
the A.W.U. told delegates to a conference
in Brisbane that “there could be no wage-
pegging without the strictest control of
prices and profits.” Can this be taken
to mean that the gentleman is in favor of
Federal price-and-profits-control with
wage-pegging?
A monthly paper heads its January
issue: What Does 1951 Hold? The
answer to date from Queensland and
the N.S.W. coast is: Water!
Six men were drowned when 450 tons
of coal in the collier Kiama shifted in
the battering she got from the heavy seas
and practically threw her on her beam
ends on the way from Newcastle to
Sydney, The Kiama’s cargo was most
urgently needed. That’s why her
courageous crew took her to sea in
the face of serious storm warnings
and an already raging ocean. Had
the city had sufficient coal reserves
to see it through a few stormy
days, the Kiama could have waited for
safer weather. But the Communist policy,
implemented by the miners, is “no coal
reserves,” The “policy” of the McGirr
Government is not to do anything
about the Communist “policy.”
The Australian Wheat Board can’t get
contracts for wheat-sacks for next
season’s harvests, and is urging the wheat
States to rush up bulk-storage equipment.
If it waits for the N.S.W, Government
to rush anything like that it is in for a
long, long wait.
Melbourne had a “lightning” tram
strike on Saturday because the
trammies objected to the Tramways
Board cutting down the number of late
trams and thus reducing the overtime
bill! Yes, there’s a Communist “a-leadin’
of ’em.”
Victoria may yet have a State lottery.
Deputy-Premier Dodgshun says the Gov-
ernment would organise lotteries to help
hospitals “as a last resort only.” The
Government recently added £3oo*ooo to
its budgeted million to‘keep hospital
wards open, but the hospitals have
threatened to discontinue 1000 beds unless
finance is forthcoming. The State will
never cease cursing the day it falls for
the lottery stunt.
Latest British Communist to write a
book on why he has recanted from Com-
munism is Douglas Hyde, until March,
1948, editor of the Communist “Daily
Worker” and “front-line” worker himself
for the Stalinist cause in U.K. It was an
unaccepted opportunity to call the
volume Mr. Hyde and Dr. Jekyll.
The best part of 2,000,000 people in
Sydney felt they’d been half-drowned in
rain again last week. They really got off
lightly. On the day it began North Queens-
land had just registered in one week
52.36 in. at Sarina, 43.51 in. at Calen,
37.75 in. at Eton, 33.37 in. at Proserpine
and 31.3 lin. at Mackay. Rockhampton
wharves were feet under water from the
swollen Fitzroy, and the whole city
escaped being submerged only by the
skin of its teeth.
In the Attlee Socialist Government the
Ministers change their jobs as often as
they change their shirts —a sufficient
revelation of the rapidity with which they
make a hash of the nation’s business. In
the latest change Aneurin Bevan

the Labor Minister, goes to Pensions,
Marquand from Pensions to Health.

Food, became War Minister, and Shin-
well, War Minister after holding Supply
and Fuel, went to Defence. As London
“Daily Telegraph” mordantly remarked,
“A poor hand was never noticeably im-
proved by rearranging the cards.”
Melbourne “Argus,” after wasting a lot
of ink urging the Menzies Government
to “take over” price-control, which it
cannot do unless the people say so by
referendum, has now got the argument
down to a fine point—it believes that
wage-pegging must accompany price-
control, but that price-control must come
first. It hasn’t, so far, urged the Menzies
Government to peg both wages and prices
at the same time, though if that Govern-
ment has power to do one it has equal
power to do the other,
“Old-timer”: Touching that British
peanut fiasco in East Africa, there was
one of a different kind on the N.S.W.
Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area a score
or so of years ago. Some bright soul got
the idea of growing peanuts there and an
experimental plot was duly prepared, the
inevitable “heads” gathering for the
initial planting. The usual speeches were
made in which a great future for the
M.I.A. peanut industry was prognosti-
cated, whereupon somebody turned to the
bag of “seed.” It was then discovered
that what the bag contained was the kind
of peanuts one buys in the shops,
properly roasted and all.
A company has been registered in
Adelaide for the purpose of growing tea
in New Guinea. A small planting has
already been made, and the promoters,
R. M. Williams and C. V. Thompson,
are happy about the way the plants are
coming along. There has never been
much doubt that tea could be grown in
New Guinea. The catch is whether it
can be picked and marketed cheaply
enough to compete with the old tea-
producing countries. Steeply-rising prices
give the present venture a better chance
than could have been expected in pre-
war days.
It looks as though wheatgrowers on
Queensland’s Darling Downs will have to
draw on some of that “stabilisation”
money which, under the Federal
socialistic wheat scheme, is supposed to
help farmers who don’t have a successful
harvest. Rain and floods practically
wiped out the Downs wheat crops this
year and robbed the growers of well over
£3£ million.
“Security” under the League of Nations

“United Nations” it is destroying
Korea.

“Aestur”; In Hcfbart’s Theatre Royal
the Fifi Banvard company was perform-
ing Somerset Maugham’s “Rain,” the
moving story of a missionary who perse-
cutes a prostitute because of her profes-
sion, then suicides when he, too, falls.
During an interval my mother, a sociable
soul, asked a bloke on his own in the
next seat how he was enjoying it. “It’s
all right,” he said. “But I like a bit of
singing,”

“Phil Anthus”: Forty years or so ago
one of the “fun” books of the day—
probably a Cole product—had a yarn
to the effect that when music stopped
suddenly at a certain concert a feminine
voice from the audience was heard to
shrill, “I always fry mine in lard!” That
tale tickled my youthful fancy, and when-
ever my mother or sisters and cronies
fell into a cookery discussion I —first
getting near the door—usually threw in
the lard-frying item. Now, in this year,
1951,1 have come upon a cabled message
in the Melbourne “Argus” to the effect
that an English vicar. Rev. H. W, R.
Elsley, having been troubled by a gossipy
congregation, caused his choir to stop
suddenly in the middle of an anthem,
upon which a voice rang through the
church, “Yes, I always fry mine in lard! ”
Mr. Elsley, it is said, reports the incident
in his parish magazine, adding, “The
House of God is not a conversation
salon.” Well, well! Who am Ito doubt
the word of an English vicar, supported
by a newspaper that “stands in the place
where it is demanded of conscience to
speak the truth”? All the same, I have
a nagging feeling that it is too much to
suppose that history has repeated itself,
right to the very letter, through the
medium of lard.

“R.R.T.”; The resurrected Sturt Ex- ,
pedition arrived at Wagga city (population
approximately 16,000) and passed like a
dose of quack medicine through a gpose-
berry-bush. The Bulletin gave us a bright
page on it illustrated by Heth. I imagine
Heth to be an old joker about 78, other-
wise I don’t see how he could have got
the technique, the art and the detail
into it. Many people saw the show, but
few were pleased, because it lacked a
touch of reality, tradition and some air
of dignity. It whizzed through the main
street on wheels with a few riders follow-
ing. The riders, weedy as their mounts,
wore doormat-combings, insecurely
gummed on for whiskers. No aldermen
or public men were associated with it.
It passed and turned its back on a very
worthy monument marking the place
where Sturt camped in 1839. Meanwhile
the old ’Bidgee, source of all the Riverina
wealth and future grandeur, rolled dis-
dainfully near by.

“V. Cluse”: Higher education has its
embarrassing moments when inflicted on
the young and innocent. A bright young
thing from our suburb who has been
absorbing the subjects designed by our
educators to suit the final secondary-
school examinations set out for a fruit
district to spend the interval between
exam, and results as the guest of her aunt.
She returned home on an evening when
her family had several guests in the house,
and came into their presence triumph-
antly flourishing a handful of notes. “My
goodness!” exclaimed an admiring
matron. “How on earth did you earn
so much money?” “Oh,” cried the lass,
with airy naivete, “castrating apricots at
twenty-five shillings a day!”
♦ * * *
“Bo”: Of those who now use the
internal-combustion engine instead of
Dobbin for the transport of the wares in
which they deal none uses it in a more
unique way than that noble character
the bottle-oh. Time was when, “doing”
the suburbs and, hand to ear, announcing
in raucous tones his willingness to buy
“rags, bags or bottles,” his ancient nag
was wont to amble along at around half
a mile an hour, stopping unbidden
periodically along the thoroughfare to
allow the kids to appear with the bagful
of empties. The other day his modern
counterpart came down our street —the
first in about four years. His truck
(empty) was doing a steady 15 m.p.h. and
about every 10 houses he sang out
“bottles” in a voice that would win
approval from a ladies’ Band of Hope
meeting. By the time Christmas-party-
throwers had got to their front gates in
the hope of getting rid of the gin- and
wine-bottles (who’d have any beer-bottles,
anyway?) which they’d have cheerfully
given away to get rid of, the alleged
bottle-oh had disappeared around
the corner. Not once did he stop.
The great puzzle is, how. does he
make the game pay?

“K.”: I see Paris has staged an
international “Congress of Cyber-
netics” —“the science of communi-
cations and control-devices,” as
a special correspondent in France
of Melbourne “Age” explains.
Revolutionary-age robots, in fact.
There was a tortoise which sheers
away from an obstacle in its path,
and when its batteries are running
down goes off to a machine for
recharging them. There was a
mechanical chess-player which
“plays an invincible game” with a
white rook and White King against
moves of the Black King made by
a mere human opponent. If the
opponent moves his king into check
the creature on the other side of
the board flashes a light in protest,
and after this has happened three
times running it “loses its temper”
and ceases to be interested in the
game. Before long they hope to
have one machine playing against
another. This is all rather childish
waste of time. Why don’t they
turn out a mechanical brain which
people like Premier McGirr can
use instead of whatever he does use
for directing the Government of New
South Wales?

“Clooter”: Though I’m all for the
advancement of science, it seems some
sort of a movement should be started
here to suppress a Harley-street
(London) specialist named Leyton. This
chap peps up his patients by injecting
into them extracts from the pituitary
gland found in sheep’s heads. It’s
claimed that this treatment stimulates
backward pupils, tired businessmen
and baldinghousewives- This sort
of thing may bfc all but
as one who is always depressed
by the number of backward pupils and
tired businessmen he encounters, not to
mention the thousands of housewives
being hurried to an early baldness
through tearing their hair over the price
of things, I’m alarmed at the possibility
of the medical profession sending
hunters into the sheep country in search
of sheep’s heads. Carried to extremes, as
it might well be, this new scientific step
could easily depopulate our famous
“Just trying her out for the hill-climb test.”
sheep-waiks, and then where would
the national income Jbe without the
annual wool-cheque? No, far better
sacrifice a few businessmen than face
national ruin.

“8.A.K.”: The way of a father with
good intentions is hard. Big Jim has
certainly paved his little bit of pathway
to hell. “A kid naturally looks up to his
father,” he informed me once. “He
thinks his father knows everything about
everything, and it never occurs to him
that the old man might be wrong. A
man should never do anything that’ll
make him think otherwise; but, blime,
the questions that boy of mine asks me!
Anyhow, I’m getting over it —and dead
easy. I’ve
bought hi m

paedia. Now
all I’ve got to
say is, ‘Oh,
that? It’s
No, I'm
blowed if I’ll
encourage you
to be so lazy ;

your encyclo-
paedia the way
I had to.’ ” In
theory, the
idea was flawless. But, alas! Big Jim was
very despondent when I saw him last.
“It was a terrible blue getting the boy
that encyclopaedia,” he mourned. “I’m
like a hunted animal —can’t call my home
my own. No sooner I’m in the door than
he’s at me, ‘Hey, Dad, what’s a fohn?’
and there he is with his finger on the
line, checking-up on me. And now the
stinkin’ little know-all thinks his old man
is nothing but a blasted ignoramus.”

“Chink”: Yes, the approach to news
is relative, as “Jasby” (B. 10/1/’5l)
implied when quoting a Yank journalist
who rejoiced professionally over a series
of tragedies, and when quoting also a
woman who passed over dark war-time
reports with the remark that the paper
had nothing in it. Was there not once a
keen young sub-editor who went to his
chief with a cable message and shouted,
“Big news: 100,000 Chinese drowned in
floods,” only to be told tersely, “It
amounts to nothing: throw it away”?
More personally, I recall that in my novice
days as a country reporter I got a certain
elevation of soul each time'my grizzled
editor-manager muttered, “Good paper
today, me boy.” My smugness suffered a
sea-change when I ultimately learned that
he was not, in fact, referring to the
paper’s news-content, but to the quantity
of death and “in memoriam” notices,
which were charged at double rates!
Nevertheless, so deep did those few words
sink that even now, 30-odd years later, I
still get a kick out of hearing the ghost of
the old man grunt, “Good paper today,
me boy!”,

“Zake”: The old lady peered along
the rows of books on the shelves, then
finally sought the advice of a salesgirl.
She wanted one suitable for a “young
girl of about twenty-six.” As she chased
the elusive coins around her handbag to
pay for the recommended book the sales-
girl, bending down to write out the
docket, said by way of conversation:
“A pretty jacket, isn’t it?” The old lady
gave it close inspection and nodded
approval. “Yes, dear,” she agreed. “Did
you hand-embroider it yourself?”

“T.McN.”: It may cheer all horse-
lovers to know that their favorite animal,
which has such a long and honorable
record both in the peaceful development
of this country and in its defence in war,
is still playing a useful part in spite of
mechanisation. Dollars are important
just now, and crayfish are great dollar-
earners when exported to America, so
South Australian farmers have been
selling unwanted farm-horses at any old
price for cutting up into bait for crayfish
pots ; a herd of 300 were recently driven
to Port Macdonneli for the purpose.

“Eventide”: Four years ago a number
of N.S.W. people, realising that quite a
lot of elderly people found themselves
homeless in the evening of their lives,
decided to do the best they could to pro-
vide homes for them. A committee was
formed, and this was registered with both
the. Federal and State Governments as a
charity. Some money was borrowed, a
block of land was bought at Padstow
(near Sydney), and an appeal for funds
was launched. As a result seven cottages
have already been erected and fully
furnished, and these are occupied by
14 elderly people. Now an effort is
being made to build small cottages in
each of which five elderly women will
live, each occupying a separate unit.
The tenant will pay a nominal rent of
10s. per week, and will have her own
quarters, garden, etc. The first of these
cottages will be dedicated as a memorial
to the poet Henry Lawson. Contribu-
tions to this fund may be sent to the
Eventide Homes Appeal Fund, Room

SAVING ELECTRICITY.
“A crowd of 19,000 was blacked-out for an hour
at a Harold Park trotting meeting. The club hopes
soon to install an emergency lighting plant.”
In factories and suburban grots
The blackout used to weary us,
But now they’re blacking-out the Trots,
The matter’s getting serious:
A lighting plant at Harold Park
Last week achieved publicity—
But why not race them in the dark,
And save on electricity?
It’s not much use to watch a nag
Go clop, clop, clop, clop, clopperty
When ail you want to do is bag
Spectators’ fluid property;
And many and many a human shark
Of tried and proved duplicity
Could do this better in the dark,
And save on electricity.
The punter knows he’s got to lose—
Or else he lacks sobriety;
He’s not out there to pick and choose—
He likes the ’course society;
He knows that he’s an easy mark
Of weekly periodicity.
So reef it off him in the dark,
And save on electricity!

“Max”; In a side-street of Toowoomba
(Q.) the other day a small gang of
P.M.G. men were working on an under-
ground - cable job. Enjoying a few
minutes’ relaxation while awaiting the
arrival of material, they squatted around
and rolled cigarettes. Their respite was
rudely disturbed when a near-by window
was flung up and an irate lady thrust her
head out. “Can’t you men do an honest
day’s work?” she yelled. “What do you
think we pay
rates for? I’ve
a good mind
to get on the
phone and
report you.”
She slammed
the window
down again.
Shortly after-
wards a
council utility
appeared and
out jumped a
stormy official.
“What the
blazes do you
fellows think you’re doing? You’re all
sacked. Call and get your time.” Then
his eye happened to glimpse a red truck
parked some distance away. He shut off
steam, hesitated, and “You are council
men, aren’t you?” he asked. On being
told they were P.M.G. employees he
sheepishly edged towards the ute. Wav-
ing an arm airily, as the truck moved off,
he called, “Take it all back. You’re not
sacked after all.” And all because the
lady had just been served with her rate
notice!

“L.A.P.”: Three-quarters-of-a-million-
pounds’-worth of art treasures versus the
stuffed carcass of a horse and the horse
wins every time. Phar Lap’s hide is still
the most popular exhibit in Melbourne’s
Museum and Art Gallery, though prob-
ably few of his admirers have heard of
the Van Eycks. Mr. R. H. G. Haines,
assistant director of the gallery, has an
unusual scheme to remedy this state of
affairs. He said “Phar Lap’s body should
be placed in the centre of an intricate
maze, through which people must pass
the whole gallery of paintings to find it.
If they didn’t stop long enough before a
required number of pictures a trapdoor
should open and they would find them-
selves back at the front-door and have to
start in again. It is disheartening to be
working in the gallery and to find that
so many people come here only to see a
horse.”
“Old Unionist”: One might swear that
any McTavish would be a Scotsman;
but I have met one who doesn’t speak

being Alexandre Macktavisch —which he
agrees is pronounced just like the name
of the mon from Aberdeen, ye ken. The
boys decided that he should be Sandy.

“Pip Tok”: First of the centenaries to
be celebrated in Westrafia this year is
that of the Perth Literary Institute, which
was founded under the name of the Swan
River Mechanics’ Institute on January 28,
1851. The original building was a one-
story affair, standing on land, then worth
£lO, granted by the Government of the
Colony, at the corner of Hay- and Pier-
streets. Within a few years, other blocks
were granted and two new buildings
erected. One of these was, for many
years, the only museum in Perth. The
Institute was fortunate in having, as its
foundation president. Captain John
Septimus Roe, R.N., the Colony’s first
Surveyor-General, who maintained an
active interest until his death in 1878.
A collection of natural-history specimens
presented by him gave the museum its
start; specimens lent by the museum
formed part of the Paris Exhibition and
of the Melbourne Exhibition of 1880.
“ Nonsense, dear—they only grow to that size in North Queensland."
The collection was bought by the Govern-
ment in 1892 and transferred to the new
Museum in Beaufort-street. The present
building was erected in 1898, Although
formed as a mutual improvement associa-
tion and called a Mechanics’ Institute,
members included politicians, business
and professional men. At least one
member of the Royal Family became a
life-member. This was the Duke of
Edinburgh, who called at Perth in 1868
and gave the Institute a tenner. Present
name, the Perth Literary Institute, dates
from 1909.

“Pasquin”: The fine flying film “12-
o’clock High” illustrates the way fashions
in military heroes have changed since
1939. The hero of the film is a tough,
scowling U.S. brigadier-general confronted
with the job of straightening out a unit
w'hose CO. has become “overidentified
with his men.” The C.O, lacks the
resolve and ruthlessness necessary for all-
out air warfare ; he thinks more of his
men than of victory. This goodhearted
softie is given a base job ; the tough b.-g.
takes over and with harsh, cold discipline
turns the outfit into a winning combina-
tion. Fifteen years ago the story would
have been pacifist propaganda. The
tough b.-g. would have been a stubborn
old martinet, obsessed with the minutiae
of Army routine and intent on crushing
the spirit of his men. The softie would
have been a thoughtful idealist who
realised that those under him were human
beings and not robots. There would
have been an inevitable clash between the
two; the b.-g. would have had the softie
court-martialled and cashiered. The
softie would have been ruined, but
morally triumphant. I can’t work it out
further, but something would have hap-
pened to vindicate the softie and expose
the b.-g. as a dangerous old fool. Nowa-
days, of course, even popular writers and
film studios realise that discipline has
some connection with a well-trained Army
and that some generals are every bit as
able as any private.

“Lineshooter”: There is one R.A.A.F.
lad who will always remember the R.A.F.
optical service. The eye-specialist, a
wing-commander, wrote him a prescrip-
tion for spectacles. The Aussie wore the
specs for a few weeks, but still suffered
from eyestrain and headache, so he
reported back to the specialist. “It’s
about these spectacles you prescribed for
me,” he said. “They’re no good, sir.”
The wingco hit the roof. “No good!
Well, you Aussies are the blanky
limit. Why, man, they’re brand-new.”
The Aussie pondered over this for a few
moments, saluted and withdrew, dumped
his specs in the rubbish-tin and headed
into town to a civvy eye specialist.
“E.H.M.”: “B. A. Ker’s” poetic wail
(B. 10/1/’5l) reminds me that when the
ergot disease first made its appearance
on paspalum a Sydney suburban Civic
Father moved at a council meeting that
paspalum be declared a noxious weed in
N.S.W. “B. A. Ker” calls it “King of a
jungle that nobody sows”; tons of pas-
palum-seed are sown annually, particu-
larly in S.Q. and northern N.S.W. —the
dairying and grazing industries in these
districts have been built up and survive
rin a foundation of paspalum. The
American market also absorbs about 600
tons of the seed every year, and the
demand is increasing because paspalum
is specially suitable for use in “dust-bowl”
areas.

“Bamekaw”: Are modern youngsters
softer than their Dad’s were? In my
schooldays we used to indulge in a form
of wrestling, mounted pick-a-back, and
termed “cock-fighting” ; I see it no more.
Also vanished is “high-cockalorum,”
another rough-and-tumble, in which one
team bent down with head to rump, in
the manner of an elongated Rugby
scrum, while the other side with flying
leaps landed as heavily as they could on
the waiting backs in the hope of breaking
the line. I strongly suspect that the
lumbago of many of my contemporaries
started years ago when immature back-
bones were asked to take the impact of
801 b. or so of flying boy. Another gentle
diversion was “sacks on the mill.” The
rules were simple. All that happened
was that, when
you saw one of
your mates fall
over, you hurled
yourself on his
prostrate body,
shrieking out
the words from
which the game
is named. At
this rallying-cry
boys would
come running
from all points,
and joyously
hurl themselves on the heap till a size-
able pyramid of human flesh had been
formed. Some deep-rooted reminder of
race-preservation caused the heap to
disintegrate before the bottom layer was
asphyxiated, and I cannot recall any
really serious accident resulting. Yet the
other day when I asked a lad his favorite
playtime occupation, he solemnly
replied “Folk-dancing.” Pah!

“Mikyo”: This “What’s in a name?”
theory of “Barossa’s” (B. 3/l/,’51) regard-
ing plonk is all wrong. In my experience
“plonk” is not a general term for Aus-
tralian wine: it is a class as distinct as
port, sherry or any other; its other names
are “bombo,” “pinkie” and “snakejuice.”
I know three regular dealers in this com-
modity, and none of them calls it “plonk,”
The Wop at the sly-grog shop calls it
“vino”; my mate Bacchus, who uses it
to dilute his metho on a 50-50 basis,
always asks for “a half-crown bottle of
port”; my wife puts it on the grocery-
list as “a bottle of cooking wine, please,”

“Ike Hollar”: When the news of an
old friend’s death came to me my
curiosity was about whether he had got
his last words right. On our last meeting
he had been cheerfully facing the end,
but took the opportunity of my visit to
discuss with me whether he should use
“will” or “shall” in the last words he
proposed saying to his family assembled
for his farewell. There was never any-
thing the old pedant enjoyed more than
a discussion of that sort, so I humored
him and before I left we had agreed on
the correct word. Now it appears that
there was no “last word” ; the old fellow
had gone peacefully to sleep in the even-
ing and at midnight he was found to
be dead.

“Eve”: Met him crawling parkwards
one boiling hot day. “Going to the
Gardens for lunch,” he snapped, waving a
paper-bag. “Saves one-and-seven. The
place I used to eat in charges two-bob for
a sandwich-and-tea now, so I take a five-
penny sandwich up to the Gardens in-
stead.” “How do you get on for the tea?”
I asked. “Oh, that!” he snorted. “I have
a drink of lukewarm water from the
bubbler. With the tea they give you nowa-
days you’d hardly tell the difference.”
HIT THE DECK!
“Widow, young-middle-aged, attractive, means,
very keen card-player, would correspond with gent.
S 5-15, same interest, view mat.” —Agony ad.
She’s still upon the sunny side of fifty
And rather adequately lined with pelf,
She’s in the category of the nifty,
For, modestly, she vouches that herself.
These form, I ween, a happy combination
Of attributes, something that well affords
To some prospective ’groom, whate’er his station,
Of satisfaction quite the sublimation.
But note: she loves “the broads.”
On her ability to “run up” pasties,
To render succulent a leg of lamb,
Concoct a wide variety of tasties,
She’s as completely silent as a clam.
Perhaps the reason is that she considers
Those of far less importance than this fact:
Of all the nation’s band of merry “widders”
She is, at bridge, the very ace of bidders,
So bold, yet so exact.
What if she couldn’t fasten on a button,
Or knit a jumper, mend a pair of socks,
Couldn’t discuss the merits, say, of Hutton,
Or tell the diff. between egg-plant and phlox?
But, ah! The dexterous manner of her shuffle,
The cool, expert assessment of her hand!
On busted flush or straight you’ll find her bluff’ll
Succeed. A sky-high call will never ruffle
Her perfect self-command.
Here, then, for him who likes his game of poker.
Who loves the lone misere to contemplate,
To chase the bowers or the elusive joker —
Here is undoubtedly the ideal mate.
Instead of listening to the radio blaring,
Or hopping out to night-spots or the flicks,
She and her lord would quietly be chairing,
With “fifteen two” and “fifteen four” declaring,
And then “a pair makes six.”
The most successful conjugal relations,
According to psychologists, are those
Where “things in common” lessen altercations.
Their lives they thus more placidly dispose.
That may be so. But this I merely mention:
Her Number Two could find the road has
bumps.
What with her skill at “dealing out,” dissension,
Whene’er it comes, could cause him apprehen-
sion,
His star to suffer serious declension,
For she’d hold all the trumps.

lacks that annoys him most. I’ve tried
the old tricks —a nail to hitch it to, or a
noose if she can get it off the nail;
jamming it between knee and bucket or,
in desperation, parting the tuft and tying
it to a rail; but in the end you’ve got to
admit the
cow’s right
to brush
away flies,
and com-
promise is
balled for.
Perhaps the
most irritat-
ing touch
Janie im-
parts to the
act is, after
lashing
both my
ears, to let the accursed appendage lie
with wanton familiarity around my neck,
or drape it negligently across my knee —
in which case I lower an elbow upon it
and not only restrain the whisking a
while, but probably prevent another dis-
turbance, the first stage of which is an
elevation of the said tail. Such minor
gains are sweet consolation to the harried
milker, for he knows darned well that,
though he may be on the council or be
the .local heavyweight champ, may own
the best rooster or the greatest thirst in
the district, may be the village snooker
wizard or an elder o’ the kirk, to his cow
in the suifraier-time he is just another fly.

“Brolga”: I’ve always understood the
feeling which makes a bushman, alone in
a bustling city, hail with deep relief a
mate from some outback town. Many
times, since I came to the city, I’ve been
greeted with almost frantic delight by
some stockman who had known me on
an outback cattle-camp. Nevertheless,
such claim for kinship in reverse left me
a bit staggered. Was trout-fishing near
my solitary camp by the banks of a
Monaro (N.S.W.) stream when I was
hailed from the opposite bank. “They
tell me there’s a bloke from Bondi camped
here somewhere,” the waving figure
yelled. Thinking that maybe someone
from the city was trying to trace me to
tell me I’d won the lottery, I modestly
replied that I was the bloke himself.
“I’m from Bondi, too,” was the joyous
answer. Thanking my stars that the
water at this point was both deep and
cold I quietly backed into the tea-tree and
headed upstream.
♦ * ♦ ♦
“Big Mat”: You blokes have been
hearing a lot about me from that talka-
tive mate o’ mine; now I’ll tell you
something. He starts hanging his hat up
to a girl in Echuca, see. We’re
doing a bit o’ fencing out towards
Kanyapella, and strike me roan if Nugget
—that’s me mate, see, the bloke that
sends you them letters about me—don’t
hire a flash sulky in the town one Sunday
and drive her out to our camp. Me, I got
no idea what he’s up to, and don’t expect
no females to be around, so I peels off and
hops into the dam to get a few mussels,
reckoning I’ll chuck a line in that after-
noon, the river being about two-mile
afaay and the fish good. Well, I got a
good few, and I’m having a blow on the
bank when I hear voices, look over the
bank and there’s Nug. and this girl. I
duck down. He looks around and then
sights me, having left the girl sitting in
the sulky. “If you don’t get that girl out
o’ this,” I snarled, “I’ll come up the bank
as lam and go you scone-hot.” Old
Nug. laughed, thinking I was having him
on, see, so I screwed up me dial and made
to run up the bank. He give me one look
and broke evens across the flat, flew into
that sulky and went up the road like a
bloke gone mad, with the sulky bounc-
ing about and the girl hanging on and
yelling. He comes back that night and
I says, “That ought t’ be a good yam
for them Bully blokes,” but he told me
to go to —well, that’s why I’m telling
you meself.

“Wippegong”: Outside my window
are a few stray stalks of ripe oats; the
sparrows have found them and, to my re-
“Every time eggs go up HE thinks it's something to crow about!"
lief, have varied both their diet and their
sport of scattering the dry-mash in the
hens’ hoppers. They land half-way along
a stalk, sidle towards the head till it
bends to the ground, and there extract
the grain at leisure —and, incidentally,
proclaim themselves finches. The gaudy
imported goldfinch has the same trick.
So have our modest little natives; zebras,
double-bars and the like. And remember
that little river that was crossed by the
road from headquarters to the strip at
Milne Bay? Kingfishers haunted its
banks, green pigeons flashed in the sun as
they shot across from one belt of black
jungle to the other, but in the partly open
grassy patch near the bridge were dozens
of little brown-and-purple finches. We
meant nothing to them; beside the
traffic or idling stragglers passing within
a couple of yards, they slipped down
seeding stems, swaying over the water or
lost where they settled near the ground.
Never saw their nests; but the nests we
did find, and dodged, were those of the
yellow wasps under the clay banks of that
creek. There must be something in that
air stimulating to air-fighters, for what
those furies did to the neighboring insect-
life was much on a par with the way
Turnbull’s boys handled the Japs.

“Bad Australian”: It would appear
that Australia has again backed the
wrong horse in introducing to the north-
west the mesquite described by “Salmon
Gums” (B. 10/1/’5l). There would be
a different tale to tell, however, if the
seed had been that of the honey-
mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), which is
found from Mexico to the Argentine
pampas, where it is known as algarroba.
The curse that has been unloaded on us
appears to be the spiny and practically
useless algarrobilla. The honey-mesquite
is a valuable fodder-tree; its fruit
figures largely in the diet of the
Indians of the Argentine, Bolivian and
Paraguayan sections of the Gran Chaco.
They make a fairly appetising kind of
johnny-cake of the pounded seed, and
also brew a reasonably potent drink
called aloja from the immature fruit.
Periodically borracheras or wild, unholy
jamborees are held on this booze, which
last for several days non-stop, and when
one is in progress the encampment of
the celebrants is a good place for a white
man to be away from.

“Zanthos”: The) boss was out drafting
the late lambs and the missus was helping.
The big ones had been sold, and the rest
needed their wool off to avoid blow-fly
strike, grass-seeds and burrs. The yards
were hot and dusty, and one lamb went
down, nearly smothering. The missus
carried him to the near-by pond to revive
him. Pushing through water-lilies and
mud to the water she found the bees
there first —hundreds of them lining the
water’s edge, queuing, up for a drink.
Drafted, the lambs moved unwillingly
towards the neighbor’s woolshed while
the mothers protested in the yards. The
missus followed up in the old car, pick-
ing up any stray sick lambs. One
young’un, unmarked, broke back to the
yards and the missus did a sprint to
catch him. Putting him into the front of
the car she went round to the driver’s
side, but the lamb took fright as she got
in. Shooting over the front seat on to
the back he went straight through the
rear window —at least his head did, and
there he hung supported by spikes of
“safety” glass! The missus grabbed a
struggling leg with one hand and tooted
for the boss with the other. After all, a
lamb these days is worth 90-bob, and
who knows what it will be worth when it
grows up?

“Kelms”: Pothunters, foreign “sports-
men” and small boys with shanghais
have received an ally in their war on
small birds in a dusky-hued newcomer
to W.A. He’s
the Ceylon crow,
a specimen
smaller than our
own Kelly, just
as black except
for a grey
“collar,” rather
less scrupulous
and twice as
vicious. Troops
who called in at
Ceylon will know
him, and will
have sympathy
with the W.A. birdlovers who aim to
eliminate him as soon as possible. That
might be difficult. He’s already been
seen in places 150 miles apart, and if he
has taken to the bush he’ll thrive. But
he’s sure to leave visiting-cards in the
form of disembowelled birds smaller
than himself.

“Globe Trotter”: Acting on the advice
of her next-door neighbor she decided to
rear some chickens, and got hold of a
broody hen which finally hatched out a
fine clutch of chicks. They thrived for
a time, then began to lose condition
until several of them died. The disap-
pointed woman consulted her neighbor,
who inquired as to the chickens’ diet.
“Oh,” she replied airily, “I’m not feed-
ing them on anything—-they’re still on
their mother”!

“Old-timer”; It was towards the close
of a long, maddening, hot and dusty day
in the drafting-yards. Men and dogs were
tired and irritable, the old boss had
dropped into that hitter taciturnity of
his which usually presaged a storm.
When the last hundred weaners broke at
the gate and raced off in bunches toward
the scrub. Big Fleming screamed “Bless
them” or something, Little Curl threw
his hat on the ground and jumped on it,
Pocketknife collapsed in tears. The boss
took a deep breath, then blasted us from
topknot to breakfast-time as the worst
collection of fools this side of Hades,
aspersed our ancestry and that of our
ancestors, cursed our past, present and
future and then sacked the lot of us on
the spot. Wearily we went to the hut,
bathed, ate, half-heartedly debated where
we’d go for another job, sorted out gear
for departure and presently went to bunk.
We were at breakfast next morn when
the old boss came down. He got a
pannikin of tea, sipped it, looked us
over and said "You blokes look as though
y* might know somethin’ about sheep.
Had t’ sack all me men last night. Could
do with a few good hands.” Big Fleming
stood up. “We might have it on,” he said
gravely, “but don’t you go askin’ us for
references. The last boss we worked for
was too flamin’ ignorant to write.”
; There was a gleam in the boss’s eye as
' he replied “Well, I don’t write me opinion
of anyone, I tell ’em. You can start
straight away.”

“Aestur”: The pelican certainly isn’t
noiseless (B. 3/l/’5l). We scared a big
flock on the bank of a creek near the
Murray a few miles from Beni (S.A.),
and as they took to the air they grunted
like pigs—we took them to be sounds of
alarm. This was the only time; they
fish silently, and the only sound to accom-
pany the incredible aerial feats they
perform in formation is that made by
their great wings.

“Bo”: The itinerant book-salesman
had called in at old Margetts’s place just
on the rise over the bridge, Margetts, a
bachelor cocky who was locally cele-
brated for his unorthodoxy in the matter
of pets, was also an avid reader, so that
the salesman had booked a fairly solid
order. Snapping his order-book shut the
salesman bent down, twisted the catches
on the lid of his case which had fallen
closed while he had been operating his
high-powered talk, lifted the case, shook
hands with his customer and was half-
way down the path to the road-gate when
a piercing whistle came from the veranda
he had just left Looking around, he saw
old Margetts, a look of consternation on
his dial, peering hither and yon. The
salesman hesitated for a bit while his
customer rushed into the house. Half a
minute later he emerged, and by then
the salesman had drifted uncertainly to
the gate. He was just undoing the latch
when Margetts hurried up. “I can’t find
Aussie anywhere,” he said in anguished
tones. Then his eye fell on the sales-
man’s case. Unceremoniously grabbing
it out of its owner’s hands he opened it.
Joyfully he dived his hand in and hoisted
out about sft. of brown snake. Then,
as the salesman fell back, his eyes stick-
ing out like organ-stops, the full import
of the dastardly attempt smote Margetts.
“Y* thievin’ swine!” he roared. “Tryin’
to get away with a man’s pet when he
wasn’t looking. Y’ can cancel the order
now, an’ think yourself lucky I don’t give
you in charge!”
"A really snug model , sir."


“You blokes know where y going?”
“M.U.R.”: Shakspeare and “Bellerive”
both knew more than “Wobbly Kelly”
(B. 17/1/’5l), for snakes do hiss, though
they don’t make a practice of doing it on
all occasions. I’ve probably killed and
seen as many as any other bushman my
age, and only twice did I hear the hiss:
once when I cornered a brown in an old
piano-case that was being used for a
chaff-box, the other when a tiger dis-
puted the right-of-way with me alongside
the Prill Park woolshed. The first one’s
hiss was a combination of fear and bluff,
the tiger’s was definitely a threat.
“W.K.” can get a fair imitation of the
sound by putting the tip of his tongue
against his top teeth and exhaling
strongly. You’ve got to be close to your
snake to hear it. Not so with a goanna.
This chap has a hiss which amounts to a '
low roar and can be heard feet away.
Apparently all reptiles are capable of
sound; even a sleepy lizard, when
desperate, can make a hiss which sounds
like a miniature snarl, whilst one of the
smaller garden lizards actually barks.

“Zake”: The weekly mixed came
down through the cutting and round the
rather sharp bend where the line is partly
hidden by a thick patch of blackberries.
The driver looked, swore, leaped to the
whistle-cord and slammed the brake-lever
hard over. But it was too late. As the
train bumped to a grinding stop the loco.
crew got down and started on the job of
removing the dead cow which was
jammed under the bogie. Ten minutes
later, as they pushed the carcass down
the incline and straightened up, a sawny-
looking cove sitting against a tree almost
opposite the engine stopped chewing his
straw for a moment. “I tipped that
might ’appen,” he drawled. “That cow’s
bin muckin’ about on that line for nilly
half a hour. A wonder she ain’t bin
belted before—she’s alwiz there.” The
driver looked across. “Well, couldn’t y’
have got up and shooed the damn’ thing?”
The recumbent one stared for a moment,
then grinned broadly. “Aw,” he said
slowly, “it’s easy to see you don’t know
much. Y’only shoo’orses, not cows!”
♦ * ♦ ♦
“Solitude”: We were crossing the flat
when Seventyfiver began peering around
expectantly, a scowl on his mug. A large
hare jumped up. The old cattle-dog gave
chase, and I gazed after them a while,
then turned back with a chuckle. “I
know, I know,” snapped Seventyfiver
irritably. “Long-ears ain’t tryin’. It’s
the same ev’ry momin’. He waits f’r us
on purpose,” He was still growling when
we ran into Sandy, and Sandy’s tale of
his new greyhound-cross went unheeded
till the old bloke caught sight of that
mong. “Gripes, he’s the same color as
Blue,” he exclaimed. “I’ll borrer that
bloke orf y’. Er —er —no way o’ makin’
’im look a bit littler, I s’pose?” Sandy
eyed him stupidly. “Well, y’ c’d stand
’im in a hole,” he suggested. “Yair, or
walk ’im in long grass,” grinned the old
bloke. “That’ll do; long grass.”
Approaching the flat the following morn-
ing, Seventyfiver made Blue stay behind,
as he rode on through the long patches.
The hare jumped from a tussock. The
new mong took off, there came the usual
derisive skirmishing, then as the hare
suddenly dropped his ears and began
to run, Seventyfiver’s mirth broke loose.
His roar followed the pair round a fern-
patch, down the flat, back, round the
fern-patch and up the long spur. It
echoed joyfully as the dog, after taking
a couple of turns out of the quarry, sent
him flying madly into the hills. “Lost
him in the rough,” I murmured. “Y-yair,”
managed Seventyfiver happily, “but thatll
leam ’im. Bet after this, he (hee-hee!)
he’ll treat Blue with a bit o' respect/’
“Rooster”: I watched one of the
garden spiders at work in the top corner
of the porch entrance. It was dangling
from the transverse beam on about a
yard of thread, seemingly a purposeless
effort, until the stiff breeze swuni the
little engineer through space to ajichor
the free end to the upright support,
Other silky strands were glued to
precisely-placed points, and soon the
polygonal framework took shape. A
diagonal link-up was quickly effected, and
from the point of its bisection radiating
threads soon appeared. Connecting the
spokes spirally appeared to require extra
care and adjustment* but the whole
operation took only 50 minutes, complete
with thousands of globular gummed
deposits for catching the victim on a
“sticky.” The icurious thing is that,
although the trapped prey is hopelessly
foot-bound in the web, the spider itself can
scamper quickly over it in effortless style.

“Vet”: It was about five years ago I
first visited old Jack. Jack and his missus
had acquired two rooms and veranda on
four or five acres of bush just outside
the town, and, by watching each bob,
eked out a living on their combined
allowances. “You’re foolish to buy all
your needs, when you could make this
place practically self-supporting,” I
mentioned. “You’re not too old to do a
bit of clearing now and then, Jack, and
with the bush off you could grow your
own vegetables, fruit, eggs and even run
a few sheep to help keep yourselves in
meat,” Jack thought it over and
evidently saw the point, for it wasn’t long
before he began grubbing out a little
patch of scrub each week. His interest
grew, he planted seeds, and later built a
fence across his small property. Last
week I again stayed with old Jack. In
one corner was his vegetable-garden, in
another several fowl-pens, a row of
fruit-trees graced the fence, and on the
remainder, sown down with special
grasses and topdressed, grazed half a
dozen lambs. But a meatless dinner was
followed by a meatless tea. “I suppose
you provide your own mutton nowadays.
Jack,” I mentioned. “When are you
killing one of those lambs out there?”
- “Kill one /” The old bloke was aghast.
“Gripes, we couldn’t eat one o’ them,”
he gasped. “Why, we’d be cuttin’ our own
throats, at the price they’re bringin’!”
♦ * * *
“Wonk”: The big straight gum was
spoiling the garden, but, afraid to saw
it down lest it hit the house. Dad
sought the bloke who did the falling
for the timber-mill. “You could fall
it away from the house, couldn’t you.
Jack?” he inquired. “Yair. I’ll drop
it for you at the weekend for a quid.”
“A quid! Gripes, you ought to fall
j
it and cut the surface-roots for that, ,
growled Dad. “Tell you what. I’ll give
you ten-bob to fall it, and I’ll cut the
roots meself.” “A quid to fall it,” said
the bloke. The argument lasted 10
minutes, then Dad
concluded it stub-
bornly. “Well, X ain’t
payin’ more than ten-
bob,” he announced.
“It won’t take as long
as y’ think. I tell y’
what: you fall ten-
bob’s-worth, an’ I’ll do
the rest meself, Y’ c’n
use my tools, but I
won’t be home Satur-
day, so leave me axe
sticking in the top o’
the stump when y’
finish,” Dad was in
the pub on Saturday
afternoon when the timber bloke re-
turned. He reported that he had done
his ten-bob’s-worth, that the tree had
fallen away from the house, and he col-
lected his pay. Last seen. Dad was
hopping round the straight trunk that
was chopped off about 30ft, from the
ground, was pointing at the marks of the
springboards, and howling about his axe
that showed plainly oyer the edge of the
cut.

“M.U.R.”: I see where Victoria is
talking about protecting goannas to save
’em from extinction by pea-rifle marks-
men who find the go. an easy target,
since he generally runs up the nearest
tree and sits there. Tortoises, too, are
copping it, from their habit of basking
on the surface and getting a bullet
through the carapace. The go. is an egg-
thief apd chicken-taker to some extent,
largely because eggs and chiqkens aren’t
enclosed on the average farai, bq.t it
more than makes up for it by the bunnies
it destroys. I’m all for protecting the big
lizards and, though I don’t want to start
an argument, I’d protect eaglehawks, too.
UP. COUNTRY
THE TUSSOCK-GRASS PLAIN.
Buttercups yellow and violets blue.
Nid-nodding grasses like delicate grain;
Snow-berries looking like white drops of
rain;
Steepled pink fly-catchers baited with dew:
These were but some of the flowers that
grew
Long ago down on the tussock-grass plain.
Wreaths of white heather-bells fit for a
bride,
Patches of greenhoods like pools by the
tide
Left in low shallows, fenced by the tall
Tasmanian scrubs that encircled it all.
The primeval wonderland, lovely and lost,
Unnamed and unknown, on the wild
North-west Coast,
Where many a mountain was yet no-
man’s-land
And many a gully unmapped and un-
spanned,
Timber and tree-fern, a green-matted gulf
Where still roamed the vanished marsupial
wolf.
thought I might some day return with
the spring
And go where the little grey bandicoots
hid
In the tents of the tussocks, to hear the
birds sing
In the blackwoods and sassafras jungle
amid
The towering eucalypts fencing the edge
Of nothingness, guardians of gully and
ridge,
I should travel the tussock-grass, find my
way back
To the past by some wandering wallaby-
track.
Back with the springtime and after the
snow
And frost-winds of fifty grey winters ago.
But they tell me the blossoms no longer
remain
To celebrate spring on the tussock-grass
plain:
That now where the cypress and wattle
grew lush
Bulldozers have torn out the heart of the
bush,
The stringybark giants have vanished away
As well as the blossoms that danced for a
day,
The myrtles all moss-grown and centuries
old
Are not, and their fastness is flattened and
rolled,
Torn by the tractor and tamed by the
plough . . .
They say it is all good potato-land now.
But at least I have seen it, at least I have
known
That world where a thousand wild bugles
were blown
Calling September, that followed and came
Apparelled in azure and argent and flame.
Unaltered and glorious, always the same.
While buttercups yellow and violets blue
Flooded the acres that lately were sober
In the onrush of beauty that gathered and
grew
And broke like a wave on the edge of
October.

THE STOCKYARDS.
Maybe those rails are falling.
And rotting those yards may be.
But ever I hear them calling
Over the leagues of sea.
Although they are no more trodden
By my scattered mates and me.
I am back once more in the battle,
With memories still to keep
Of the tramp of a hundred cattle
Or the dust of two thousand sheep;
They come to me in the daytime,
They come to me in my sleep.
The calves or foals that we mustered
Are ready for rope and brand;
The week’s fresh horses are clustered
And there in the small yard stand
Awaiting the stockman’s riding
Or ripe for the breaker’s hand.
Long days amid dust and barking,
Long days at the drafting-gate
As we picked up the swift ear-marking
That flowed like a stream in spate
And turned them into the side-pens
Or missed one—a moment late!
Hard knocks when a roped calf fought us,
Hard fall when a rough colt threw,
Dark days when the stockyards taught us
How little of stock we knew,
Till at last we came by the hard way
To be one of the useful crew.
That’s where we tasted the essence
Of courage and give-and-take;
That’s where we learned the lessons
Of many a crude mistake,
And that’s why the yards are with us
Whether we dream or wake.

MONSOON PATROL.
Heavy with rain the grey clouds earthward
strain
And float like wisps of hair among the
trees,
Tracing a changing pattern with the
breeze.
A long black line moves through the
tangled roots,
Black bodies sway, whilst ’neath our heavy
boots
The leaf-mould sags as we plod through
the rain.
The paperbarks o'erhead are rich in bloom.
And on their boughs, against a darkening
sky,
Cicadas drown the clustering fruit-bats’
cry;
The thunders roll, then from the swampy
bogs
Come deep-voiced roarings, as a myriad
frogs
Call loudly to their mates amidst the
gloom.
Now comes the storm, a wall of hissing
grey
Lashing the tree-tops. Like the angry wail
Of rain-men sweeping down a dreamtime
trail.
Crying and calling that the earth gods give
“Food to this country that the tribes may
live.”
The lightning answers as the tall trees
sway.
The clouds roll on; the sun, a spear of
light.
Strikes through the trees, a challenge to
the rain. \
Now see the white-faced lilies of the plain
Toss all together as the light wind heaves
And brings a sigh of gladness from the
leaves
Whilst tall ground-orchids sway like elves
in flight.
Yet still the thin black line flows on with
ease.
Winding o’er hill and plain, to pause and
rest
Near jungle stream, or on some mountain
The hours fly past, for fateful time has fled.
I watch a child asleep on mother s
As we go plodding onward through the
trees:
Until at night, beside the smouldering fires
I listen to the chants of these strange men,
Hearing their children laugh; and, once
again, , , . , . . ,
My thoughts go back into the natives lore
And through a misty haze I see once more
The dreamtime children marching with
their sires.

Korea, and what has followed in its
wake, have altered the economic stresses
and strains everywhere, and the dominant
feature of the position today is the
relentless pressure of inflationary forces,
both external and internal. Prices and
costs are high, and are expected to go
higher, while essential raw materials are
in short supply, and so is skilled and other
labor, and fears are growing that there
will be a reimposition of wide-ranging
controls. At the moment odds are in
favor of an increase in total demand,
with rearmament leading the way. But
the problems created are numerous and
complex, and so are the remedies neces-
sary to deal with them effectively.
Our swollen export income, especially
for wool and metals, is due in part to
America’s short-term policy of obtaining
large supplies quickly for its stockpile
and rearmament programmes. The
inevitable rise in prices and wages, which
are being pushed up by other factors,
too, has already created a dangerously
top-heavy costs structure, the long-term
effects of which have yet to be felt,
because there has been no corresponding
increase in production. The Government
has already taken a number of appro-
priate steps to cushion the ill-effects of
what is happening, and a more thorough
regearing of public policy to the capacity
of the economy as a whole is called for.
However, the function of arresting the
drift is not the sole responsibility of the
Government, but calls for a co-operative
effort from all. An important factor in-
volving the principle of stability is the
need to adopt a national wage policy
under which wage-increases will be
directly related to increases in produc-
tivity.
Meanwhile, as usually happens under
such circumstances, events are leading to
a flight from money into inflation hedges.
In trade and industry there is a predis-
position to accumulate materials and
components that are expected to become
scarcer and dearer. In the investment
market more people are anxious to deploy
their capital so that its purchasing-
power will not decline as the cost-of-
living mounts. In this connection, the
position of bank shares lies between fixed-
interest-bearing securities and that of
commodity or industrial equities, with a
greater measure of stability than many
of the latter. The 1945 Banking Act
prescribes neither floor nor ceiling for
trading-bank profits or dividends, but it
does subject bank activities to a large
measure of central-bank control in rela-
tion to advances, interest-rates, invest-
ments and the freezing of deposits, all of
which react in one way or another upon
earnings. The controls are being used
mainly to restrict inflation. Bank earn-
ings and dividends have been allowed to
rise, as a glance at the introductory table
shows.
Last term the E., S. and A.’s profit,
which increased by £21,345, reached
£224,310, best since 1939. It was a
modest 4,2 p.c, on shareholders’ funds
(capital and reserves combined), or 7.4
p.c. on the £3,000,000 of capital alone.
The div. remained at a nominal 10 p.c.;
nominal because English income tax of
9s, in the £ reduces it to 5.5 p.c. (stg.),
equal to 6.9 p.c. in Australian currency
at the current rate of exchange.
Balance-sheet figures reflect the effects
of inflation and of steps being taken to
combat it:

This is the group of Australian drug
houses that got together about 20
years ago to mitigate the effects of
aggressive competition, reduce overhead
and gain advantages on the buying side.
The operating units, scattered throughout
the Commonwealth, now comprise:
Elliotts and Australian Drug Pty., Ltd.,
Sydney and Newcastle; Felton, Grimwade
and Duerdins Pty., Ltd., Melbourne;
Felton, Grjmwade Dental Co. Pty., Ltd.,
Melbourne; A. M. Bickford and Sons, Ltd.,
Adelaide and Brisbane; Felton, Grimwade
and Bickford, Ltd., Perth, Fremantle and
Kalgoorlie; Taylors, Elliotts and Australian
Drug Pty., Ltd., Brisbane, Rockhampton
and Townsville; L. Fairthorne and Son Pty.,
Ltd., Launceston and Hobart; Drug Houses
of Aus- Export, Ltd., London buyers;
Hudson’s Eumenthol Chemical Co. Pty.,
Ltd., Sydney; Sandas Pty., Ltd., Sydney and
Melbourne.
They manufacture and distribute drugs,
proprietary medicines, cosmetics, medical
and scientific instruments and toilet
goods, etc.
Before World War II competition from
Britain, Germany, France and U.S. kept
earnings and divs. moderate. Since the
end of hostilities economic, exchange and
other conditions, including rapid growth
of the population and “full” employment
at high and rising wage-rates, especially
for females, have provided fresh oppor-
tunities of which the group has made the
most. Selling-prices of some lines are
still controlled, but expanding turnover
has more than taken care of advancing
costs, net earnings have benefited, the
dividend has been strengthened, and so
have reserves, while shareholders’
prospects remain bright.
Since 1946 those on the register
have put up £1,264,700, of which £829,756
was capital and £434,944 share premiums.
The latter (fixed by capital-control
authorities) make an 8 p.c. div. worth
only 5.2 p.c. on the total amount of new
capital issued during this period. At
June 30 last the £3,405,000 of paid capital
(it includes £lOO,OOO of 6 p.c, pref,
money) had the support and assistance
of £1,714,565 of reserves, subject to
£321,153 of goodwill, etc. Most of the
£789,632 by which the price paid for
shares in the subsidiaries exceeded their
face-value is now represented by tangible
assets, the chairman says. And he added
that reserves for depreciation, etc., will
more than meet any likely charges for
the purposes for which they were created.
The inference is that profits have not
been overstated, and that there is actually
more in the safe than the eye can see.
Last term the principal operating cos.
in all States reported record sales and
record profits. Combined net earnings
took a leap of £110,562 (44.7 p.c.), reach-
ing £357,690. That was after deducting
outside shareholders’ interests and allow-
ing £89,969 (up £8064) for depreciation,
£227,424 (up £63,308) for taxation and
an unspecified amount for other contin-
gencies. It also leaves out of the reckon-
ing £52,997 dropped from somewhere
into reserves, and £26,592 written off on
account of the export subsidiary (Drexo
Pty.), which had lost all its capital and
has been wound up. Individual members
of the group now attend to their own
export business, is mostly with
Southern Asia and near-by islands.
The £357,690 was enough to pay
the pref. div. and show 10.6 p.c. on
ord. capital compared with 7.2, 8.8, 8.1,
7.2 and 7 p.c. back to 1945. A point was
added to the div., lifting it to 8 p.c.
The year’s bigger trading is further
reflected in balance-sheet figures:

To help finance net additions of
£261,016 to stocks and £219,804 to book
debts the co. went to sundry creditors
for an extra £349,179. The growtii in the
more-or-less liquid surplus (£3,634,905)
was £52,222. Plans for erection of new
warehouses, laboratories and offices have
been pigeonholed until materials and
labor become available.

The trustee cos. are rendering an
essential service at very small cost
these days—there has been but a trifling
increase in their charges, which are
anchored by legislation, since the begin-
ning of this century. Of its kind, this
80-year-old is the largest in South Aus-
tralia and second-oldest in the Common-
wealth. Paid capital, doubled in 1925
and steady since, is £lOO,OOO in 400,000
£1 shares paid to ss, each; and it has
the support and assistance of £128,430 of
reserves.
Shareholders have had an unbroken
run of 10 p.c. divs. for the last
16 years, but it is difficult to say when
better need be expected. For the last 11
years the tussle has been, and still is, one
between rapidly-rising costs and steadily-
growing returns from an expanding
volume of business. Despite an increase
of over 78 p.c. in income over this period,
last term’s net earnings were £l9l short
of the 1939 figure. And now fresh infla-
tionary forces threaten to push solution
of the costs problem further into the
background.
Last term a record £2,034,206 of new
business was entrusted to the co.’s expert
care. This exceeded the value of estates
wound-up by £389,071, leaving trusts in
hand that much greater at £15,470,636:
Gross Exes. p.c.

1950 . . 15,470,636 91,897 78,057 84.9
Gross earnings from all sources increased
by £4BBO, and exes, (up 14s. p.c.) made
off with all but £67 of the gain. The net
result (£13,840) was 13.8 p.c. on capital
compared with 13.7, 13.9, 11.8, 11.5 and
11.6 p.c. back to 1945. The recent stiff
increase in the basic wage will further
increase the ratio of exes, to gross earn-
ings, and unless offset by an increase
in commission charges the co. will be
fortunate if it is able to maintain profit
at the 1950 level. Meanwhile, the task
of the trustee becomes increasingly diffi-
cult, especially in dealing with trust in-
vestments. There is an urgent need for
testators to give trustees power to invest
over a wider field than is now provided
by the list of legally-authorised trustee
securities.
At Sept. 30 last the co.’s capital and
reserves, together with £1260 coming to
creditors and £8503 earmarked for the
taxgatherer, were represented by free-
hold, etc., £81,700, safe deposit £30,623,
Government securities £103,377, mort-
gages £19,768, book debts £5340 and
cash £2385.
At 14s. 1 Id. (13s. 3d. a year ago) the scrip
returns 3.3 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis.

the State, a new 100,000-ton-p.a.
kiln is being installed, thus lift-
ing total plant capacity to
250.000 tons p.a. Owing to de-
lays in delivery, the new plant
made no contribution to last
term’s record output of 153,429
tons cement. The co. also holds
120.000 £1 shares, on which 3s.
had been paid when the books
closed,'"in the new North Aus-
tralian Cement Co, (Townsville).
It is a half - million - pound
popposition in which Adelaide
Steam and Goliath Cement are
also interested, and is not ex-
pected to get into full produc-

paid capital carries interest at
3i p.c. p.a. This Brisbane co.
is supervising erection of the
new co.’s equipment, as well as
its first 12 months’ operations.
To help finance the expansion
at Darra and investment in the

then stood at £294,073 in 44,878
first 8 p.c, and 182,183 second
6 p.c. cum. prefs, and 263,016
ords. The prefs. rank in the
order stated for divs. and capi-
tal, and advance point for point
with the ords. after the latter
have had 6 p.c. Those on the
register have never failed to re-
ceive an annual distribution for
the last 23 years, the average
being approximately 9.3 p.c,
firsts and 7.3 p.c, seconds and
ords.
It was the bigger output that
put the spring of £9286 into last
term’s profit, lifting the figure to
£30,717 —the coal strike had cut
into the previous year’s net earn-
ings. The £30,717 was enough to
pay minimum pref. requirements,
plus 6 p.c, to the ords., and then
show 4.2 p.c. on average capital
(pref. and ord. combined) as
against 2.3, 6.4, 2.6, 1.4 and 1.6
p.c. back to 1945. An extra
point was added to the div. on
all shares, making the rates 10
p.c. firsts and 8 p.c. seconds and
ords.
There is nothing to worry
about in the finances:

Kalgoorlie Southern Gold
Kalgoorlie Southern Gold
Mines, N.L., was recently
formed in Melbourne with
a nominal capital of £250,000
in ss. shares. Gold Mines
of Kalgoorlie, Ltd., took
120.000 paids for leases and
subscribed for 50,000 contribs.,
and a further 245,900 contribs.
were offered to those on
G.M. of K.’s share-register;
Western Mining Corp. and staff
are to take 110,000 contribs.
and other participating cos,
215.000 contribs. The new co.
will thus kick off with an issued
capital of £185,225 in 740,900
ss. shares of which 120,000 will
be f.-p. and the balance con-
tribs., payable Is. on applica-
tion and the balance as re-
quired.
The new co. has taken over
from G.M. of K. at cost leases
extending for about three miles
south of the Golden Mile
(W.A.) main workings, and is
to test-drill the area at depth
for a possible recurrence of the
main Kalgoorlie structures and
ore shoots. Extensive geo-
logical and geophysical examina-
tions of the field have been made
by Western Mining Corp., and
the evidence suggests the prob-
ability of such a recurrence in
the quartz-dolerite in this area.
The depth at which it is ex-
pected that the lodes might be
intersected is anything from
1000 ft. downwards, and it is
reckoned that the cost of the
drilling campaign will not exceed
£150,000.
The other cos. associated with
the venture are Barrier Corp.
Pty., Ltd., North Broken Hill
and Broken Hill South. Any
shares not applied for are to be
taken by G.M. of K. The future
of Westralia as a gold-producer
partly depends upon the outcome
of this well-directed and
strongly-backed prospecting cam-
paign.

BIGGER AND BETTER
A hundred years have passed since London’s first great
exhibition. For some time we have been planning to cele-
brate this anniversary by a Festival displaying every aspect of
British life. In particular, we are making the 1951 British
Industries Fair an occasion for the world to see the full extent
of our recovery and resources. We can promise that the
8.1. F. like British Industry itself, will be bigger and better than
ever. Three thousand exhibitors from a hundred trade
groups will show their latest and finest products.
Few enterprising buyers will miss this unparalleled oppor-
tunity of seeing what Britain has now to offer. Thousands
have made early arrangements for their visit, so please make
your reservations without delay.

Bearing Service (Holdings)
Bearing Service (Holdings),
Ltd., was formed in Melbourne
in April, 1950, to acquire all
the shares in Bearing Service Co.
of Australia, Ltd. (Melbourne),
and Bearing Service Co. of Aus-
tralia (Pty.),' Ltd., Brisbane.
In doing so it also became the
owner of a 100 p.c. interest in
Bearing Service Co. of Aust.
Pty., Ltd. (Sydney), Ball Bear-
ings Pty., Ltd. (Sydney), Wil-
liam Easy Pty., Ltd. (Sydney),
and a 52 p.c. interest in Bearing
Service Co. of Aust. Pty., Ltd.
(Adelaide), as well as 37.6 p.c.
of the shares in Duncan and Co.,
Ltd., Adelaide.
Almost all of the group’s sup-
plies of ball and roller bearings
are imported, the principal
sources being Hoffman Mfg. Co.,
Ltd,, British Timken, Ltd., and
Fischer Bearings Co., Ltd. —all
of England. Additional sup-
plies come from other manufac-
turers in England, U.S.A. and
Switzerland.
For shares with a paid-up
value of £142,112 in the two
principal (controlling) concerns
the present holding co. paid
£829,902. Of this £622,426 was
paid in 1,244,853 shares of 10s.
each, and £207,476 in cash,
which was raised by an issue of
414,951 ords. to the public.
Present paid capital is thus
£829,902 in 1,659,804 shares of
10s. each, compared with
£142,112 of the concerns taken
over.
Though the new valuation
placed on the undertaking was
nearly six times the paid-up
value of the old shares, and ex-
cess of paid-up capital over net
assets on consolidation was
£392,637, making net tangible
assets ss. Id. per 10s. share, past
earning - power of the cos.
showed up well in relation to
the enlarged capital. Allowing
for public-co. taxes, combined
net earnings for the year to
June 30, 1947, were 8.1 p.c. on
present capital, 18,7 p.c. 1948,
and 19.9 p.c. 1949.
For the year to June 30, 1950,
after providing £12,000 for un-
distributed-profits tax, net profits
were 19.8 p.c. on capital as it
now stands. Taxes for prior
years amounting to £139,332
were paid, and at balance-day
net tangible assets stood at
6s. 2d, for each 10s, share, fol-
lowing a reduction of £77,000
in intangible items.
The co.’s agencies, services,
management and goodwill are at
present its most valuable assets.
If current profit-rates can be
maintained the basis on which
the flotation was carried out can
be entirely justified. Though
profit-earning at present levels is
a recent development, the future
promises to be active in the co.’s
line of business. The original
company, which was formed in
1924, reported in 1950 that in
only one year since 1931 have
trading results not been better
than in the preceding year.
The co. is paying an 8 p.c.
div. On profits shown it could
pay a good deal more. But it
will be wise to set aside a sub-
stantial proportion of its earn-
ings until capital has more
tangible support. However, if
the present trading experience
continues, and funds are not re-
quired for further expansion, a
10 p.c. distribution may be a
possibility in the not-far-distant
future.
On an 8 p.c. div. basis the
10s. shares return an immedi-
ate yield of 4.7 p.c. at 17s.
King Island Scheelite
King Island Scheelite ss. shares
have soared to 295. on Mel-
bourne ’Change since tungsten
from Chinese sources has ceased
to be available to Western
nations. In November the
shares sold at 9s. 6d.
In the three working weeks to
January 13 the co. produced
49.4 tons of wolfram concen-
trates from 8894 tons of crude
ore ; value was £85,000. In the
six weeks and four days to De-
cember 16 the co. treated 22,195
tons for 99.8 tons of concen-
trates, then valued at £99,400.
The co. is working, by open-
cut, a 3,000,000-ton body of
scheelite ore on King Island,
Bass Strait, the ore averaging
about 0.65 p.c. WO3. The
United States Government is re-
ported to be endeavoring to make
a direct long-term contract with
K. 1.5., and tungsten ore, previ-
ously under £lO a unit, is now
quoted in London at £23 a unit.
The co.’s concentrates are cur-
rently worth £lBOO (Aust.) a ton.
Issued capital is £500,000 in
2,000,000 ss. shares. A div. of
a shilling a share was paid on
December 12, 1950, Previous
div., in December, 1949, was 6d.
Wool and Exchange Controls
While Maorilanders are
dazzled by the wool boom,
sheepfarmers there haven’t been
losing their heads. They haven’t
gone on a spending spree, and
don’t expect to, although they
could with funds left free after
compulsory “freezing” of £1 in
every £3 in their bank accounts
from this season’s clip.
The mid - season outlook
shows they’re not carried away
by super-prosperity —at least
not yet. Perhaps it’s because
they’ve never been in the habit
of spending their income just as
“Half the work of forty years gone , and you call it just
a slip of the razor!"
it came in. In average years
they got along comfortably; in
depression they cut down and
sat tight; in the boom they’re
taking their time. They’re a
budget-minded crowd who know
how to use the bank, and they’re
doing it.
Between £4O million and £5O
million will be frozen in N.Z.
by the time this season’s 900,000
bales are sold, and perhaps that
much more will be lying around
waiting to be spent, because
growers aren’t in a hurry. It
will be a whopping addition to
M.L. trading-bank deposits—
nearly £205 million last year-
end —or some might be salted-
down in shares and stocks.
Later on a lot of it will go into
plant, equipment and improve-
ments on sheep-runs, perhaps
when prices drop back from
present dizzy peaks.
As millions from wool bank
up in N.Z., exchange pools in
London and elsewhere should
rise, and M.L. should be in a
good position to scrap exchange-
controls that have cramped the
style of investors and others
there for a dozen years or so.
There’s no reason, so far as the
man-in-the-street can see, why
the N.Z. pound shouldn’t soon
regain its old standing and be
freely convertible again—except
for dollar dealings. This would
cut the ground from under the
feet of those who by-pass official
exchange channels to buy Aus-
tralian shares and resell them
at a profit on M.L. markets. As
they’ve acquired skill and prices
for Australian shares in N.Z.
have moved up to within 5 to
1\ p.c. of Australian levels,
they’ve done well, at the expense
of others who operate only close
at home. Nothing would con-
solidate values in N.Z. like
action by the Reserve Bank to
open the doors and allow
Maorilanders to buy Australian
securities at the official exchange
rate. It would write “paid” to
share-profiteering.
If those who hold the reins
wait to see how decontrol of
imports, which has now gone
two-thirds of the way, pans out,
it shouldn’t be many months be-
fore M.L. knows the answer, for
it is quickly emerging from the
stage of State-planned shortages
on the Socialist pattern.
Consolidated Metal Products
Incorporated in November
last year with nominal capital of
£750,000 (paid -up £250,000),
Consolidated Metal Products,
Ltd., will act as a holding and
controlling company for its six
wholly-owned subsidiaries en-
gaged in manufacture and dis-
tribution of battery equipment,
lead oxides and certain chemi-
cals. Electric and kerosene
hot-water-storage systems are
also manufactured.
Present trading interests
already extend throughout the
Commonwealth and into New
Zealand, and some overseas cus-
tom is enjoyed. The subsidiaries
are:
Battery Equipment Supply Co. Pty.,
Ltd. (paid capital £12,000); Battery
Equipment Supply Co. Victoria Pty.,
Ltd. (£12,000); Phoenix Chemical Co.
Pty., Ltd. (£4000); Lead Products
Pty., Ltd. (£6000); Lead Refineries
Pty., Ltd. (£12,000); Swiftsurc, Ltd.
(£50,000).
Lately the company made an
issue of 500,000 10s. shares to
directors and staff and a few
customers and friends.
This issue, which was oversub-
scribed by £lO,OOO, spreads the
shareholding throughout the
eastern States. Profit figures of
the subsidiaries are not made
known. Working capital is in
excess of capital figures given,
and the new moneys will be
used for expansion.
Directors of the co. are J. H.
Broinowski (chairman and
managing-director of each sub-
sidiary), A. R. Allen, C. J.
Doring, F, F. Munro and W. L.
Walters,
Korma Textiles
In an outsize share deal just
before the curtain fell on the
1950 investment year Felt and
Textiles of Australia, Ltd.,
parted with its 500,335 £1
ordinaries in Korma Textiles
(N.Z.), Ltd., to give Stanley and
Hilel Korman, managing direc-
tors of the New Zealand mil-
lionaire textile concern and
their associates, majority con-
trol. The price wasn’t an-
nounced, but Korma ords. were
selling at 15s. on N.Z. markets.
With the exchange gain added,
the Australian vendors should
have received between £400,000
and £500,000.
Korma’s chairman, Jim
Gentles, said in Auckland that
the two reps, of Felt and Tex-
tiles —C. Rhodes-Smith and H.
W. Rowden —on his board would
retain their seats, and the
management would follow the
direction it had been travelling
before the deal. Relations would
remain on a co-operative basis.
Felt and Textiles first joined
forces with Korma in February,
1947, nine months after the N.Z.
co. was founded. There haven’t
been any ord. divs. yet, as the
co. has concentrated on paying
off heavy ordinary and special
depreciation on its costly plant,
and has had production and
marketing problems to sur-
mount.
Earlier last year J. Gadsden
(Aust), Ltd., converted share
assets in J, Gadsden (N.Z.),
Ltd., into cash and transferred
funds to Australia with exchange
advantage.

London Airmail
From Herbert Holman
The broad facts about Britain’s
fuel crisis are simple enough.
There’s sufficient coal beneath
the ground to serve the nation
for half a millennium, but
there aren’t enough face-workers
to operate the machines that
hew the coal and convey it to
the surface. Because of the
dirty, unhealthy and dangerous
nature of the work, lack of
housing near the pits, cleaner
jobs elsewhere and, not least, the
social consciousness of wives
and families, the labor force is
dwindling. Moreover, the
miner’s wage-packet has grown
so fat by comparison with other
years and his scarcity has be-
come so marked that he feels
entitled to take a day off just
as and when he pleases. He
does, too frequently. On New
Year’s Day, for instance, two
out of every five miners in
Yorkshire stayed at home, at a
cost of about 100,000 tons of
coal.
In his broadcast appeal for
the help of everyone “in pre-
venting a fuel crisis which may
come, which will come, unless
we all do what we can,” Mr.
Noel-Baker, Minister of Fuel
and Power, showed that he was
out of touch with the facts. The
fuel crisis is already here among
us, as Mr. Noel-Baker would
soon find out if he were to tele-
phone his coal-merchant. He
might, after succeeding in de-
feating the persistency of the
“engaged” signal, hear a tired
voice answer: “Sorry, sir, I can
only book the order. I can’t
promise anything,”
At the coal-merchant’s office
he would find a weary and im-
potent staff trying to cope with
a throng of importunate cus-
tomers in varying degrees of
anxiety and exasperation. He
would also notice that many of
them brandished slips of paper
bearing the hurried scrawl and
impatient signatures of general
practitioners. Doctors’ certifi-
cates in a coal-office! The next
must surely be: Ministry of
Fuel and Power. Medical Cer-
tificates (Coal, Coke and An-
thracite —■ Domestic Premises)
Division.
Miners are exhorted to pro-
duce more per man —and they
don’t, except in spasms. (We
have even heard that civil ser-
vants have been working late
addressing envelopes containing
individual appeals to miners.)
Housewives are exhorted to save
fuel, and react impatiently to the
admonitory pointing finger of
officialdom. This is as much an
age of exhortation as it is of
planning. When plans fall down
appeals follow. If planning, in
the shape -of attractive show-
rooms and advertising cam-
paigns, has enticed the house-
wife to buy the tax-bearing
goods she can hardly be blamed
if she wants to use them,
especially when those who sell
the goods also supply the fuel.
On a higher level, the Prime
Minister and four members of
the Cabinet, including the
Foreign Secretary, have received
the full executive of the
National Union of Miners. It is
reported that the Prime Minister,
when asking for an extra
3,000,000 tons of coal in the
next four months, said that
another fuel crisis might “bring
their Government down.”
Mayn’t the householder rightly
feel that such an avoidable crisis
ought to bring any Government
down, and that he and his
family, by choosing to sit in the
cold, are keeping Messrs. Attlee
and Co, in?
Theatre in 1950
Last year was a profitable, if
hardly distinguished, year for
the theatre. Many shows —too
many for mention here —settled
themselves down to bring con-
tentment to managers, surtax
forms to authors and continuous
employment to actors. Once
again the standard of acting has
far exceeded that of production
or authorship. Yet it is notice-
able that a few young British
playwrights are making names
for themselves. Christopher
Fry at one time had three plays
running concurrently. Wynyard
Brown’s “The Holly and the
Ivy” is the one play in London
which, by its sentiment and sin-
cerity, has audiences eating out
of its hand. Australian Hugh
Hastings has done extremely
well for himself with his true-to-
life Naval comedy “Seagulls
Over Sorrento.” A young actor,
Denis Cannan, has shown his
command of wit and craftsman-
ship in “Captain Carvallo” and
has attracted the notice of
Broadway. And a Scots lawyer,
Roger MacDougall, has reached
the West End with a comedy of
manners, “To Dorothy, a Son,”
and is held to have come to stay.
The sensation of the year was
T. S. Eliot’s “The Cocktail
Party.” Opinions differ as to its
quality, both as poetry and
drama, but it is doing enormous
business on both sides of the
Atlantic. Other established
authors have not had a good
year. Rattigan, Bridie, Lons-
dale, Priestley and Coward have
added little to their reputations.
It is paradoxical that the only
regular playwright to have a
strong personal following in
England is the Frenchman Jean
Anouilh.
Some highlights of the year,
in brief: the end of those mara-
thon runners “Annie Get Your
Gun” and “Oklahoma! ” ; the
comparatively poor quality of
their successors; the continu-
ance of R, F. Delderfield’s
comedy of service life, “Worm’s
Eye View,” into its sixth year;
the drift back to the stage of
film-actors from their enforced
“resting”; the churlish lack of
acknowledgment by the London
theatre on the death of G. 8.5.;
and another record-breaking run
of nearly 500 performances, this
time for a classic, “The Beaux’
Stratagem,” and the reason for
it —not so much due to a new-
born interest in Farquhar as to
the fact that the husband and
wife who shared the leading
parts were household favorites
on the radio.

“If women do not chase men there

Marriage-guidance official Dr. Ethel
Dukes.
Why should you live in single
loneliness
Or hold a job to earn enough to
dress.
You city girls,
When there are builder’s
laborers who earn
So much these days that they
have cash to burn
Or buy you pearls?
And why should you get up to
milk the cows
When you could change your
state for marriage vows,
You country belles,
When shearers make as much os
English lords
By working on, say, half-a-dozen
boards
With ample spells ?
But if you don’t set out to chase
your man
As women have since e’er the
world began
You’re plain obtuse ;
And when your sisters see you
poorly dressed
And ask you why, it’s feared
you’ll have at best
A lame excuse.
D.H.E.

“In the forthcoming N.S.W. 26-
mile marathon championship a mobile
amplifier will broadcast to competi-
tors light music and sports results,
and give progress reports on the race.”
“Now they’re all at the
barrier, but one or two
fractious competitors are delay-
ing the start. One competitor
on the extreme left persists in
‘wheeling,’ and he’s being cau-
tioned by the starter . . . There’s
another delay now —yes, they’re
slapping another competitor
heavily between the shoulder-
blades. It looks as if he’s
swallowed his chewing-gum.
“And talking of chewing-
gum, what better could you
grind between your tombstones
than Giggley’s? It is now avail-
able in the latest flavors —beer,
gin and rum. You can become
a regular beer-chewer and save
yourself the anguish of know-
ing that every time you up-end
a schooner in a bar you’re mak-
ing a present of about fivepence
to Artie Fadden. Don’t forget
the name —Giggley’s. If ‘chews
on chewing on.’
“They’re racing! As they jog
up to the five-yard mark there
“ Really , I wish you'd CONCENTRATE!”
are sixty-two in the lead, with
another thirty about six inches
back. It’s hard to sort ’em out
from this distance, but I think
‘Jog’ Trotter leads by a quarter
of an elbow. In another half-
mile or so the field will start to
string out, so until then we’ll
return to the studio. This is
2GG. Now here’s Nellie
Blucher to sing ‘My Boy
Friend’s Got a Busted Nose, He
Breathes Now Through His
Ears,’ with Count Panzee and
his Rhythm Hicks . . .
“Back at the marathon now.
They’re still bunched up so
tightly some of the competitors,
fearing pneumonia from the cold
air being blbwn down their
backs by those close behind
them, are pulling on sloppy
Joes. They’ve gone quarter
of a mile and there’s only
twenty-five and three-quarters to
go. It’s getting really thril-
ling ! . . .
“Do you suffer from flat feet?
When you take your shoes off
after walking or running do you
have to prise your toes apart in
anguish? If so, change to Doc-
tor Jubble’s special toenail-
support shoes. These have such
comforts as the famous half-
hollow peptonised heel, plaited
tongues, sanforised eyelets, a
miniature springboard in the
soles and a special vitaliser in
the reversible instep. Remember
the name Doctor Jubble’s
famous toenail-support shoes —
‘they give you fits.’ And now a
spot of bright music to help
competitors face with cheerful
hearts the gruelling miles ahead:
Duke Wellington and his band
playing ‘The Crematorium
Blues’ . . .
“Now, here are the placings
for the Welter at Moonee
Valley: Fleabag first. Sunburn
second, Itcher third. No scratch-
ings . . .
“Back to the marathon again.
Now we can get a much clearer
idea of how they are faring.
They’ve gone half a mile and
the excitement is becoming in-
tense, There are only fourteen
now bunched in the lead, with
the nearest group about ten feet
back, and if they can keep this
up right to the end it could
devel®p into one of the most
sensational finishes of all
time . . ,
“Do you get cramps in the
legs if you run only forty miles?
Why put up with this discom-
fort, with the added risk of
drowning if you happened to run
into a deep lake while you were
so stricken, when you can ob-
tain instant relief by using Doc-
tor McCuckoo’s Calibrating
Compound? Anti - corrosive,
colloidal and non-coagulating,
this marvellous remedy needs
only half the bottle rolled into
the affected muscle with a brass
ruler for an hour and the re-
sult is magical Except for a
slight limp for about a week the
leg will be completely restored
to normal. Get your bottle at
any chemist’s. Only half a
guinea a bottle, or, as a special
concession, three guineas for
half a dozen. Remember the
name Doctor McCuckoo’s
Compound—‘lt’s a pore-pene-
trator.’
“Now back once again to the
race. It’s just over one hundred
in the shade at the moment, and
if you listen keenly you can hear
the panting of the competitors
closest to the ‘mike’ . . .
“Now here’s a special an-
nouncement. Do you perspire
too freely in hot weather when
you are exerting yourself? You
needn’t. By using the famous
Waterwings soap your pores will
become so clogged up you
wouldn’t be able to sweat if you
tried.
“Back to the marathon.
Although your favorite station’s
mobile unit has been going along
in first gear it got so far ahead
we have had to stop and wait
for the field to catch up. From
here it looks like Dan Lollylegs
in the lead —yes, it’s Dan right
enough—nobody could mistake
those long legs, that easy loping
gait. And there in second place
is Ben Bouncer, his short,
nuggety legs going like pistons.
Ben’s action stands out like a
beacon ... No, it isn’t Dan in
the lead, it’s Ben! Dan’s back
in the ruck somewhere . . .
“Now before we continue the
description here is a very im-
portant message. It’s foolish to
stay hot and uncomfortable
when you can keep beautifully
cool by having a long sleever
of Molar’s Magnificent Beer.
Its winking bubbles, its rich
creamy lather are fascinating to
behold. Deliciously iced, this
sparkling drink laving your
parched tonsils is truly a nectar
for the gods. Remember the
, . . aw-awk . , . clunk! . . .
Hey! Lemme alone, you, and
get back into the race or I’ll
have you disqualified!”

SUNDRY SHOWS
ARCHIBALD PRIZE.
Newspaper reproductions do
less than justice to William
Dargie’s Archibald Prizewinning
portrait because they tend to
cramp it, and a little more than
justice to the Harbor landscape
by Lloyd Rees, which took the
Wynne Prize, because, while its
best qualities of hard drawing
and massive structure show
clearly, there is no indication of
its academic iciness: it is the
bare anatomy of the Harbor,
with nothing of its life of ships
and poetry of light.
This is Dargie’s sixth award
since 1941, and he is likely to
go on winning at pretty regular
intervals; for, though he is not
Lambert nor, so far, up to Long-
staff at his best, there are few
painters of portraits today who
can match him for all-round
craftsmanship.
In the first place, he can paint
an excellent likeness ; and, when
all is said and done, a portrait
should look like the sitter; it
should not be less like him than
a photograph, but more like him.
He gets his effects without dis-
tortion ; which is always a test
of virtuosity, for it is so easy to
create a temporary astonish-
ment by standing the sitter on
his head or turning him into a
corkscrew. He has —what so
many of the other entrants lack
—an aesthetic sense, a feeling for
harmony in color: the grey suit,
the red tie, the green drapes , . .
everything in this portrait, if not
astonishing, is in good taste.
The aesthetic sense and the virtu-
osity show together in the actual
texture of his paint; which —
while other painters so often
employ a thin and greasy tech-
nique—is pleasant to look at.
And, above all, he has a feeling
for the proportions of a pic-
ture ; his figures live at ease
within the canvas, with space
around them.
He is almost the only por-
trait-painter in Australia today
who paints like a professional;
who takes his job really seri-
ously; and who has, however
hard it is in costume and ges-
ture to make a modern business-
man look like Madame Suggia
playing the ’cello or the resplend-
ent cardinals of Velasquez and
El Greco, a touch of the grand
manner. Sir Leslie McConnan,
general-manager of the National
Bank, doesn’t look like a prince
of the Renaissance ; but he does,
in the commanding ease of the
pose, in the rugged geniality of
the character displayed, in the
cut of his clothes and the
spaciousness of the setting, look
like an outstanding figure in the
modern world of commerce.
But if the portrait thus seems
a reasonable choice for the
award and an admirable picture
to hang in the boardroom of the
National Bank, it is not the pic-
ture one would choose to hang
in a private collection. Some-
thing is always missing in a
Dargie portrait: imagination,
gaiety, the force of an original
genius. Up to a point it may be
a model of craftsmanship; but
it never breaks away from the
careful craftsman to take on
the glowing, independent life of
a great work of art. It is like
the novels of a Galsworthy
from which one turns, in dis-
satisfied admiration, to look for
the profound genius of a Con-
rad: the thing that transcends
reality.
Two paintings by Mary Mc-
Leish, slight though they are,
are a welcome relief in their
freshness from the overwhelm-
ing competence of the prize-
winner. Arthur Murch’s gay
and grotesque picture of the
comedian George Wallace is a
relief. Hayward Veal’s portrait
of Hugh McCrae is a relief;
for though Veal hasn’t taken
the job of the portrait-painter
very seriously, painting only the
poet’s head bobbing up out of
nowhere, he has put down an
engaging impression of McCrae,
who, when he comes to town,
always does look like some ro-
bust apparition, as if he has just
stepped on to the earth for the
first time, and likes it very
much. (H. A. Hanke’s portrait
of Veal, incidentally, is a sound
piece of work in a straightfor-
ward style.)
Dobell’s entry, the portrait of
Hudson Fysh, is hardly to be
described as a “relief” from the
Dargie. There is nothing very
fresh about it, in the paint at
all events. It is black, thin and
tacky and looks as if it had been
painted in Indian ink. yEstheti-
cally, especially in the strange
ghastly dinginess of the hand —
Dobell has never attempted to
paint flesh-tones —it is ugly. But
yet it is alive. There is some-
thing genuinely memorable in
the negligent ease of this por-
trait, with so much alert vitality
both of sitter and painter under-
lying the surface of polite
humor.
The present commentator —
reluctantly, because Dargie has
attempted and, in a sense,
achieved so much more —prefers
the Dobell to the prizewinner;
but prefers, far above either of
these, Ivor Hele’s self-portrait.
In space and dignity Dargie may
outweigh Hele; but not in any
other quality.
Here is a technique just as
good as Dargie’s; in fact —the
painting around the eyes is really
magnificent—more solid, more
durable, the reflection of a
deeper, more dynamic person-
ality. And in dramatic quality,
in the tension of the pose—the
painter, momentarily drawn back
from his easel, seems to be
challenging the universe; as in-
deed a painter does —there is
nothing in the whole exhibition
that remotely compares with it.
For its combination of technical
strength, vitality of characterisa-
tion and dramatic force, all ex-
pressed without recourse to dis-
tortion, it is the most striking
portrait exhibited in Sydney for
years.
Among the Wynne Prize
entries Lloyd Rees clearly stands
out. Lance Solomon has not
done himself justice—why did he
not exhibit one of the larger
landscapes from his recent ex-
hibition, or one of his beautiful
seapieces?—and though there is
a good watercolor of the Centre
by John Eldershaw and a
pleasant piece of green and grey
in L. S. Pendlebury’s “The
Cyprus Tree” there is nothing
seriously to challenge the cold,
hard but masterly prizewinner.
Lloyd Rees exhibited far more
exciting work —his huge, sombre,
nightmarish landscapes —in last
year’s Society of Artists’ show.
Hie Sulman Prize attracted the
usual array of ineffable mon-
strosities, and, merely by strolling
from one end to the other, the
adjudicator displayed incredible
fortitude. There doesn’t seem
to have been any particular
reason for pausing to give the
prize to Harold Greenhill’s
harmless “Summer Holiday”;
but no doubt the judge had to
stop somewhere before he could
get away, and Greenhill has
been the winner of a travelling
scholarship.
Promise may lurk somewhere
in the paintings by the pupils
of Desiderius Orban at David
Jones’s Gallery, Sydney, but
among the harsh grey pottery,
the dead or tormented flowers,
the abstractions, the turgid har-
borside slums, the slathery por-
traits and the leaden landscapes
it is difficult to detect. The
crude, cumbrous force of
Orban’s own best work is
merely crude here, and the
Central European gloom appro-
priate to the teacher is inappro-
priate to his Australian pupils.
E. Finlay’s jars against a green
drape say more for themselves
than most of the pottery-paint-
ings, G. Marjason’s “Kirribilli”
is a pleasant Orban pastel, K.
Moate’s “Lane Cove” a good
Orban landscape in heavy green,
and there is a feeling for
atmosphere in J. C. Powell’s dark
landscape “Trafalgar.”
Because the brasses, which
too often are classed as “just
blaring” instruments, pre-
ponderate in a military band the
unthinking are apt to consider
that the dispensing of fine music
is rather beyond such an en-
semble—-“all right for stirring
numbers and all that.” This is
far from the case. The A.B.C.
Military Band, which was
formed 17 years ago when
Lieut.-Col. Adkins came out to
give it the inaugural blessing (it
was then known as the National
Military Band), has developed
into a first-rate band capable of
playing almost any type of
music. The first of its Jubilee
concerts will be at Sydney Town
Hall next Saturday night, and
the programme will include the
Mastersingers’ Overture, Liszt’s
Second Hungarian Rhapsody
and Elgar’s “Chanson de Matin.”
Lieut.-Col. Adkins, who has just
retired from the position of
director of Kneller Hall, the
Royal School of Military Music,
is one of the world’s outstanding
military band conductors.


Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
The Commemoration Celebrity Concert
at the Town Hall next Saturday night
will be under the baton of Sir John Bar-
birolli. Later on Lady Barbirolli, who, as
the oboist Evelyn Rothwell, is a celebrity
in her own right, will give her first recital
with Margaret Schofield as accompanist.
Guests of the High Commissioner for
Pakistan and the Begum Haroon were
entertained at Port Melbourne on board
H.iVI.P. ships Shamsheer and Sind. The
hosts were assisted by Commander M. A.
Aiavi, of Shamsheer, and Commander
Ahmed, of Sind. After a dinner of tradi-
tional dishes, which included pulao (rice
and meat) and shami kabab (spiced meat
made into flat, round cakes), a presenta-
tion of silver salvers was made to the
two commanders. The visit of the
Pakistani ships is in honor of the Federa-
tion celebrations, and in his speech,
delivered in faultless English, Commander
Ahmed expressed a wish that Australia
and Pakistan should work together for the
ideals for which the British Common-
wealth stood.
The Begum Haroon’s formal dress
consisted of knee-length tunic and full
trousers, known as the gharara; these
were of soft grey tissue woven with silver
threads. Over her shoulders was a
matching silver-edged sari. Beautiful
silver jewellery completed a colorful
picture. Mrs. J. McEwen, wife of the
Minister for Commerce, wore a gown
and jacket of white moire taffeta. Presi-
dent of the Legislative Council, Sir
Clifden Eager, was with Lady Eager, she
in a gown of aqua-blue brocade. Air-
Marshal George Jones’s wife was dis-
tinctive in grey, rainbow-spotted satin
goyvn and tiny bolero. Lady Wales wore
a jacket of white and silver lame over
her black gown. Mrs. Norman Robin-
son’s slim-fitting gown was of black
crepe. Mrs. R. R. Dowling, wife of
Commodore Dowling, chose a gown of
palest mauve lace. Commander J. S.
Robertson’s wife wore black, floral-
patterned taffeta. Mrs. W. L. Russell
Clarke’s filmy black lace bolero, worn
over black, was patterned in white
flowers.
Betty Minor, of Tennessee, U.S.A.,
who has been house-guest of Col. R.
Ramey, U.S. Military Attache, and Mrs.
Ramey, was guest-of-honor at a late-
afternoon party given by her host and
hostess at their Toorak home. Mrs.
Ramey received her guests in a light-blue
linen frock which had embroidery on
the bodice and pockets of the skirt. Her
daughter Miriam’s full-skirted frock was
of green waffle-brocade. Betty, who
leaves for home early in February, wore
a navy linen frock which had a wide
white linen panel in front. Guests in-
cluded the U.S. Consul-General, S, J.
Fletcher, and Mrs. Fletcher, Sir Norman
and Lady Brooks, Air Vice-Marshal and
Mrs. R. Willock and Mr. and Mrs. Jules
Bernard. Mr. and Mrs, John Cox came
from Lancefield for the party. After-
wards Betty and the Ramey family left
for a touring holiday in Tasmania.
After dispatching to Sydney her
Archibald-Prize-entry portrait of Bernard
O’Dowd, Madame Mario Vigano has
turned her energies in another direction.
She is a member of the committee com-
posed of leading members of the Italian
community which is organising a garden-
party to assist the funds of the Victorian

The Patons and Baldwins wool show
featured many new colors and fashion
trends. Button trimmings and belted
waists add interest to jackets. One
charming cardigan in the new Catkin
fleck yarn features long deep revers, has
three buttons on each cuff and matching
buttons on each side of the slightly-
flared basque. New necklines range
from the plunging line to the high,
rounded style. Pockets are prominent.
Large patch-pockets (rather deceptive,
for, they are just side-slit openings) are
placed on the hipline of a tailored jacket.
There are deep patch-pockets with turn-
back cuffs to their slanting tops on
tailored frocks. Contrasting colors
knitted into one garment is a new way
of achieving smartness. Usually this
color-contrast takes the form of stripes.
One short-sleeved sweater had the stripes
running vertically instead of horizontally.
In the Fair Isle designs was one sweater
which had a yoke on fuzzy-wuzzy
Angora wool. The bolero, in plain wool
or Angora, is as popular as ever. Plain
and fancy stitches are used to make
attractive garments, and the new quilting-
stitch gives tone to a plain knitted frock,
cardigan or sweater.
Pictured here is Mrs. Simon Warrender,
formerly Pamela Myer, only daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Norman Myer, of Toorak.
Pamela was the first Australian girl to
join the Royal Navy and met her husband
when he was out here on the staff of
Admiral Sic Bruce Fraser. At the con-
clusion of the war Pamela went to Paris,
where she studied millinery, and then came
home and opened an exclusive Paris salon
in the store of which her father is
managing-director. Romance ripened
when Simon again visited this city and
culminated with their wedding in London
late in 1950, Simon, who is the second
son of Lord Bruntisfield, 12th Baron
Boroughsmuir, and Dorothy, Lady
Bruntisfield, was torpedo-officer on the
ship which sank the Scharnhorst. He in-
tends to settle in this country and is
looking for a property on which he can
raise cattle.
In the absence of the president of the
Vera Scantlebury Brown Trust (Lady
Herring, who is holidaying at Barwon
Heads) Miss Linda Byron Moore did the
honors at a small party in her Melbourne
Mansions flat for the 1951 winner of the
scholarship, 'May Holmes, who has been
attached to a mobile circuit with the
Maternal and Child Hygiene branch of
the Department of Health, and who is
now en route to England, During
her two years abroad May will
visit Norway, Sweden, Holland and
Finland, doing post-graduate nursing in
relation to child-care. She will also study
at the College of Nursing, London, doing
a health visitor-tutor course. The
scholarship winner trained at the Royal
Melbourne Hospital, did midwifery at
the Queen Victoria Hospital and infant
welfare at the Tweddle Hospital. Mrs.
Ronald Gordon helped her sister dispense
hospitality. Other members of the Trust
present included Kathleen Syme, Dr.
John Dale, E. H. Ebbs, secretary of the
Trust, and R. C. Pearce, managing-
director of Glaxo Laboratories, whose
firm’s generous gift of £lOOO was prac-
tically responsible for financing this
year’s scholarship.
At the M.R.C. meeting at Caulfield the
charm of white was well expressed in the
simple white linen frock with its Italian
cut-out embroidery at the neckline worn
by Mrs. S. Garnsworthy, wife of the
chairman of the club. Mrs. Garnsworthy
was hostess at a large luncheon-party,
with presswomen as special guests. Mrs.
Alec Hunter wore a navy-and-white-
pattemed frock with a white hat. Mrs,
John Cain’s grey-patterned frock was
worn with a black picture-hat. Pale
pink and blue daisies patterned the
chiffon frock Mrs. A. G. Warner wore
with a white hat. English visitor Mrs.
Charles Stanley was in junior-blue silk
patterned with tiny white stars; her hat
was of dove-grey felt. U.S. visitor Mrs.
J. H. Kraft wore a natural shantung suit
and a small natural straw hat banded with
gold-toned grosgrain. Embroidered beige
linen was the choice of Mrs. Lionel
Newton, contrast being effected with a
wide-brimmed black hat.
From Sydney
A number of things have been happen-
ing this week, mostly in the art and
marriage markets, but really nobody
thinks of anything much except the high
cost of food and the blackouts.
The blackouts have decreased man-
hours, but increased woman-hours. Most
women with young families can get
through their work only by sticking to a
strict routine, which is quite impossible
to maintain these days. When the lights
go off suddenly, time must be spent com-
forting babies who are terrified by the
unexpected darkness, and in the meantime
the older kiddies (who love the black-
outs) have devised all sorts of villainies
which have to be corrected. This is time
lost. Money is lost through food deterior-
ating in refrigerators that keep defrosting,
and in buying extra clothes because
washing can’t be done regularly. Sauce-
pans take longer to clean because they’re
being used on fires and methylated-spirit
stoves, candle-grease adds to the house-
hold chores, and one cannot depend on hot
water for any purpose. Nothing can be
planned in housekeeping any more. And
this is the summer picture! No wonder
housewives dread the winter.
When Gwen Mclver married Jim
O’Riordan at St. Mary’s on Saturday her
wedding-dress was a dream of delight.
Eighty yards of French tulle went into
it, posed over pale-pink satin and
appliqued with diamente and pearl-
studded lace. Her flowers were gardenias
and tiny pink roses. Her attendants wore
white marquisette with gold-jewelled'belts
and gold net bonnets that bore little
butterflies on each side. There were three
matrons -of - honor: Mrs, Redmond
Dalton, Mrs. M. Mclver and Mrs. John
Kouvelis, The bridesmaid was Patricia
O’Riordan. Gwen is the daughter of
the W. J. Mclvers, of Vaucluse, Jim the
son of the John O’Riordans, of Rand-
wick. About 200 guests attended the
reception at the Hotel Australia.
Dr. Norma Oliver’s third finger, left-
hand, is decorated with an emerald sur-
rounded by diamonds these days in token
of her engagement to Matthew Hogan,
qf Woollahra. Although both Norma
and Matt are Sydneysiders (Norma is the
daughter of Mrs. H, Oliver, of Neutral
Bay, and the late Robert Oliver), their
engagement is of great interest to people
in the Wagga district, where they are
well known. Norma was stationed at the
Base Hospital there after her graduation,
and has been with the Department of
Public Health in Wagga for the past two
and a half years. The couple plan to
get married in about six months’ time and
to make their home in Wagga.
From India’s coral strand comes news
of the marriage of popular Sydney
journalist Beth Gallagher, daughter of the
Cecil Gallaghers, of Brisbane, to Bryan
Woodley, at the Scots Church in Bombay.
There were about 100 people at the
church to see them married, but only 30
at the reception, for there is rationing
in Bombay and also prohibition. Beth
appeared to be quite heart-whole and
fancy-free when she left for a holiday in
Colombo just before Christmas, but the
romance was not so whirlwind as it seems,
for the two had met a couple of years
ago when Beth was returning to Australia
after a trip to England. She and her
husband will remain in Bombay for the
next 12 months at least.
Occupying Beth’s flat in Macleay-street
are her cousin Joan Woodley, who comes
from Dalby (Q.), and young Judith
Hammond, of Four Pegs, Hannaford
(Q.). Judith came to Sydney a month or
so ago to try her luck as a model and has
already had some assignments with
various publications, quite a feat con-
sidering the competition there is in this
town for such work.
There was quite a good showing by
women artists and women sitters among
the entrants for the Archibald Prize,
notably two charming light-handed por-
traits by Mary McLeish. With the excep-
tion of Millicent Preston Stanley’s smile,
which as painted by Mary Edwards is
anything but a Mona Lisa, the expressions
on the sitters’ faces are sad, serious,
thoughtful and worried. Perhaps the black-
outs have been too much for them.
Among the Sulman entries is a picture
representing society as consisting of
orchids and a serpent. Alas, society is
not so simple as all that.
While people were sloshing across the
wet Domain to see the Archibald exhibi-
tion, others were sloshing through the
mud at Avalon to view the excellent art
show the locals have arranged at the
school there. The pictures, which have
been diligently collected by Arthur Murch
for the show, are from all over Aus-
tralia and are representative of the best-
known of Australian artists. There are
also woodwork, sculptury, pottery, home
crafts. This show is part of a drive for
making Avalon a centre of community
culture. The Education Department is
co-operating with the locals in their pro-
gramme of discussion groups, literary,
musical and dramatic work, studies in
foreign affairs, and adult education in all
its phases. The art show will be on till
next Saturday,
A beautiful and interesting visitor to
Sydney is Rosemary Solomons, who is
here as part of her prize for being chosen
as “Miss Ceylon.” Miss Solomons is a
teacher in her home town, where her
whole family is connected with work in
the field of education. She plans to stay
at the Y.W.C.A. for a fortnight when the
10 days provided by her prize are up,
for she has been connected with Y.W.C.A.
work since she was a youngster (she is
now 22). Her clothes are delightful.
When we met her she was wearing over
her dress a little embroidered jacket that
she had made herself with a lavender sari.
The sari is a garment so becoming and
beautiful one begins to wonder whether
it might not become a fashion in Sydney
before long.
Perhaps the people who have bought
their autumn outfits weren’t so precipitate
after all. The Easter holidays start on
March 23, which is the earliest ever, and
the Show and Easter Meeting certainly
rate new season’s outfits. The shops have
opened up the woollen materials, with
tartans as strong as ever and texture the
catchword. It’s to be the thing apparently
to take the rough with the smooth,
velveteen with tweed, brushed wool with
gabardine, etc. The French wool materials
are amazing—so fine and firm and sheer
they could almost be accordion-pleated.
These are about 535. a yard. Nearly
all the imported woollens are from 38s.
upwards. Australian angora fabrica can
be bought for a guinea a yard. This
isn't so bad as was expected, for they are
all 54in. wide, and three yards (or less)
makes a dress. The astonishing thing is
that cotton velveteen at 19s. lid. a yard
is as expensive as fine silk velvet.
A woman in this town called Clarinda
says that anybody can be witty if they
only try. One way, she maintains, is to
take everything literally and comment on
it as such. For instance, when a woman
said to her “My dear, that girl sat there
and smoked twenty cigarettes one after
another,” Clarinda replied, “So unsport-
ing of her not to smoke them all at once.”
To a man who said he “couldn’t call
his soul his own” she said that she was
surprised he should want to. When
another said pompously that he “pro-
posed to leave the world a better place
when he died” she said there was no doubt
it would be a better place when he was
gone. She thinks that sanity must run
in her family, and she’s rather acid, but
she gets the laughs.
The Metropolitan Group of the C.W.A.
will hold its first Thursday Tea of the
year on January 25 at Endeavour House.
The time is 2.15 and the hostesses will
be the vice-presidents of the group. All
members and country members are in-
vited. The Metropolitan Group will again
conduct the kiosk at the Royal Show this
year, and hope to see all their former
patrons there.

PERSONAL ITEMS
A very welcome visitor to Australia
landed last week with a fistful of batons,
a typical don’t-give-a-darn London air
and an Army vocabulary which sits
strangely beside the Mus. Bac., L.R.A.M.,
A.R.M.C., and so on after his name. He
was here in 1934, when he delighted a
Sydney crowd by telling it he believed
in more and cheaper beer for the workers.
Every bandsman swore by him then, and
there’s every reason to believe they won’t
feel any differently this time. The name—
Colonel H. E. Adkins, one-time director
of music at the London Military College
of Music, The object—taking charge
of the A.B.C.’s brass voices on a tour of
engagements,
“Macnell”: Up-anchoring from Bal-
moral Naval Depot for Washington,
Naval Attache Captain Freddie Cook,
D.S.C., R.A.N. Of the 370 who survived
from a complement of 1200 when battle-
ship Royal Oak was torpedoed open in
Scapa Flow, Cook was the only Aus-
tralian. Appointed second-dickey of the
specially-fitted a.-a. cruiser Curlew, Cook
learnt enough of the Luftwaffe off Namsos
and points thereabouts to write a recog-
nition handbook; when Curlew finally
sank under a load of bombs off Narvik
in 1940, he again survived, to become c.o.
of the aptly-named commando-training
centre, H.M.S. Tormentor. When his
trainees did their stuff on the radio-
location station at Bruneval, Cook com-
manded the small craft which took them
off, his effort rating honorable mention
in Hilary St. George Saunders’s book of
the paratroopers, The Red Beret. Cook’s
forte then was Ids navigation, which he
will scarcely need in Washington, where
all the streets are straight.
Elevated to the Westralian Supreme
Court Bench, barely a month after taking
silk, John Virtue, K.C., War II major and,
until his appointment, president of the
W.A. Law Society. Forty-five, lofty, well-
knit and genial.
Getting in early, Otago (M.L.) Uni-
versity has engaged for thfe end of 1951,
for its Chair of English, Professor J. Y. T.
Greig, of the University of Witwaters-
rand, Transvaal. Son of a Presbyterian
missionary, born in Manchuria, the prof,
graduated from Glasgow University, and
had a shot at journalising before taking
another in the Kaiser’s direction with the
Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (the
famous “Fighting Fifth”). After the
Armistice Greig became lecturer in
English at Armstrong College, Newcastle-
on-Tyne; was for a time at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville (U.S.), and wrote
a biography of philosopher and historian
David Hume.
“Recco” farewells a colorful character:
After a life about as packed as a man could
wish, Lt.-Colonel P. S. Bapty laid down his
arms in Concord Repat. hospital (Sydney) this
month. Known from Afghanistan to Tottenham
as “John the Baptist,” he was a drummer-boy
in the British Army in India in 1899, got his
commission in 1914, M.C. in Mesopotamia,
and subsequently served in Persia, Afghanistan
and in the Waziristan and Mashud campaigns
(twice “mentioned”), ending as major. A crack
rifleman, he represented both Britain and India
in international shoots, on one occasion tying
for the King’s at Bisley and being placed on
five others. He’d been in films, such as
“Bulldog Drummond,” where expert shooting
was required, had five years in the London
Special Constabulary, drove an engine in the
big rail strike of 1926, grew a beard, and took
it off after growing tired of receiving salutes
from people who thought he was Jan Smuts.
His hobby was collecting arms, and in London
he had ah armory covering ancient guns, swords,
bows and arrows, which film- and stage-
companies frequently drew on. In Australia
when the second show started, he joined the
R.A.A.F. (where as an armament-officer he
more than indulged his hobby), came out in
1944 flight-lieutenant, then had a shot at the
American Army Transport Service (having
already got sea-time in before War I, collecting
the Royal Humane Society’s gold medal for
life-saving). In his new service he sailed
wherever U.S. troopships and Liberty ships
coursed, and that was over many seas. He
found time to qualify as a marine-engineer,
took his know-how ashore, and at the end
was managing-director of Totts Motors, of
Tottenham (Eng.).
G. K. Townshend, whose watercolors
have delighted Australians for a genera-
tion past, and whose black-and-white
work is familiar to Bulletin readers —he
contributed from the front during
1914-18 —has been elected vice-president
of the Royal Art Society of N. S. Wales.
He is also vice-president of the Austra-
lian Watercolor Institute. The trustees
of the N. S. Wales National Gallery have
lately bought another of his watercolors
for the permanent collection, and the
Mayor of Ipswich (Q.) has acquired one
for the newly-formed Ipswich Gallery',
which John Cooper has assisted in start-
ing. Another Townshend painting has
gone to the wife of the Prime Minister
of Pakistan, a gift from the Australian
High Commissioner in Karachi.
Every week almost a British engineer-
ing authority casts up hereabouts to look
over prospects. Latest is Lieut.-Colonel
Harold Riggall, boss of the big
Lincoln firm of Ruston and Hornsby,
and chairman of the Australian offshoot.
President, in 1946, of the Council of
British Engineers’ / sociation, he’ll be
hereabouts for several months, with an
eye to expansion.
Many Australian naval men will re-
member the rangy length and battleship-
stem jaw which sailed under the name of
Captain Wilfrid Patterson, R.N. He
captained cruiser Canberra out here on
exchange duty in 1936. And he was the
captain, with Admiral Jack Tovey beside
him on the bridge, who brought battle-
ship King George V’s hungry Min. guns
up to Bismarck on that rain-swept, gusty
morning which saw the German’s end.
Now, admiral and knight, he has just
retired.
The Bulletin’s artists at once recog-
nised, if not the face, at all events the
style of the self-portrait below —Scorfield
had himself met the famous “Punch”
black-and-white humorist when he visited
Sydney early in 1939. Born at Sutton
Forest (N.S.W.), in 1887, Henry Mayo
Bateman shifted early to London, studied
at the Winchester and New Cross Art
Schools and began his distinguished
career with his first published cartoon in
1906. Since then his humor has appeared
in Britain’s leading journals, mainly
in “Punch.” Here he was the great
CARICATURIST BY HIMSELF.
illustrator of the faux pas, among the
well-remembered being the guardsman
who dropped his rifle. When in Sydney,
Bateman was entertained royally by the
Society of Black and White Artists, then
in lower George-street, and presented with
an artist’s smock, on which most of the
notable black-and-white men of the day
had delivered themselves of a sketch.
The drawing reproduced here was
recently sent by Bateman to cartoonist
Ray Whiting, whom he knew in London,
and who says the subject is not nearly so
decrepit as he is portrayed.
It is traditionally accepted that poets
may starve in their garrets in the sacred
interests of their craft, but musicians,
being of less fragile fibre, are regarded as
unique should they deliberately turn away
from really big money because of
quixotry connected with their art. Which
was why some eyebrows were raised
when Sir John Barbirolli, limned here by
Dubois, turned down a fabulous salary
with the New York Philharmonic to re-
build the threatened-with-extinction Halle
Orchestra, which had been bombed out
of its Manchester headquarters. This
financial sacrifice Sir John considers a
BARBIROLLI AT WORK.
bagatelle beside the fact that in the five
years since he made his momentous de-
cision the Halle has been rebuilt to great-
ness, and before coming to Australia he
. toured with it throughout Europe.
London-born, Barbirolli started with the
’cello, but he early had a hankering to
conduct. While still in his late ’teens he
took a grip on the bottom rung by
deputising for the bandmaster of the
regimental band in which he played—
that was towards the end of War I.
Later, at two days’ notice, he deputised
for Beecham with conspicuous success,
and thereafter has never looked back —
at 37 he was the world’s youngest top-
ranking conductor, taking over the New
York Philharmonic from Toscanini, a
formidable commission which he dis-
charged brilliantly. Vigorous yet suave,
he has the happy knack of getting the
maximum out of his forces with a
minimum of fuss. An avid follower of
big cricket, Barbirolli received the
accolade last year.
Brilliant young medico Roland Beard
has been awarded a travelling scholarship
in obstetrics by Adelaide University; he
already holds the Archibald Watson
Prize for surgical anatomy, won in 1945.
He studied, as well, in the jungles of New
Britain, Diggers his patients, and went on
to Japan with the 8.C.0.F.
Heard his Last Post in London last
week, Major-General Sir Ernest Swinton,
credited with originating the idea of the
War I tank. A peace-time knowledge of
farm tractors suggested the use of
armored tractors on battlefields; his pro-
posals were pigeonholed till, in 1916,
Churchill got hold of them, and acted
characteristically: the result was the metal
monsters which the Germans first beheld
lumbering on them at the Somme.
Chichele Professor of Military History at
Oxford between 1925-39, the old soldier
had served throughout Kruger’s war,
then the Kaiser’s, and while at his work
at Oxford wrote eight books, mostly
military, possibly the best being The
Green Curve, an uncommonly clever
presentation of the psychological problem
of two field commanders each en-
deavoring to forecast the other’s
actions. First in the Army in 1888, he
was 82 at the end.
Dr. A, G, Butchers, head of the Maori-
land correspondence-school of the Educa-
tion Department, is calling it a day. He
attained enormous popularity among the
many youngsters he tutored by corres-
pondence, demonstrated to him by
crippled children travelling long distances
to bid him farewell on his retirement.
Born in Brunswick (Vic.) in 1885,
he put in five years as a Govern-
ment exhibitioner at Melbourne Uni-
versity. Forty-six years ago he taught
at Launceston (Tas.). He crossed to
Maoriland in 1918 to become head of
McGlashan College, Dunedin, which
Colin Gilray, of Melbourne Scotch
College, 'bossed before moving to the
Yarra city. In 1930 Dr. Butchers joined
the Government correspondence-school
and five years later became its head.
When, in 1939, Walter Nash, then
New Zealand’s Finance Minister of four
years’ standing, landed in London, the
“Daily Mail” greeted him: “The
Dominion regards him as its Strong
Mad. He’ll need to be. He has come
here for £l7 million.” Nash knew his
surroundings well enough. Bom in
England, he started as a solicitor’s office-
boy , worked in a bike-shop and ran a
tobacco-shop before trying his fortune
in the Fern Land with his wife and young
son. The son grew up to be a barrister;
the father began selling books and soft-
goods. Now 69, Nash has been in Parlia-
ment since 1929, was his country’s first
Minister to Washington (1941), and
apparently is placed in the same category
by the N.Z. Labor party as by the “Daily
Mail” —last week he became Labor’s
leader.
Called in to shake the collective hand
of The Bulletin, Geoffrey Burgoyne, of
Perth, rangy, sun-red and genial, full of
anecdotal vitality, culled from a lifetime
of journalistic experience. Editor of the
Adelaide “Weekly Herald” at 30, he’s
since spiked copy on the “West Aus-
tralian” (Perth), bossed the “News”
(Hobart), and in War II returned to Perth
to edit the “Daily News.” Now he
relaxes at leader-writing. An old-time
Bulletin par.-contributor and story-
writer, he knew the paper’s J. E. Webb
in Perth, indulged his philanthropic in-
stincts by chairing the Perth Children’s
Hospital board, and in 1946 set off on
what he calls his swan-song, with the
Empire Press delegation visiting London.
While there he did a conducted tour of
War II battlefields, landing on the Nor-
mandy beaches and tracing the invasion-
route through. As he admits, it was, for
a newsman who had handled here the
news of the Allies’ great effort, some
swan-song 5
Into the Silence:
At Kingaroy (Q.), from injuries received when
the homestead of his property, Greystonelea,
burned to the ground, Captain Harold Fraser,
M.C. and Bar, In Palestine with the sth Light
Horse, he later flew with the A.F.C., his
exploits there rating considerable mention in the
Official History. For some years he continued
hr civil flying before going on to the land.
At Narrabri (N.S.W.), at 92, John Matthew
McDonald, who must have been the State’s
oldest practising solicitor. He first hung out
his shingle in 1881 at Walgett, and at the end
was the best-known advocate in northern N.S.W.
He did his share of public work.
In Melbourne, Miss Philadelphia Nina
Robertson, 0.8. E., who was secretary-general
of the Australian Red Cross in World War I.
She retired in 1933.
At 80, in his Sussex (Eng.) home, Sir William
Robert Campion, the last Westralian Governor
to come out from England. House of Com-
mons member, he commanded a battalion of
the Royal Sussex regiment in War I before
coming out as Governor in 1924. During his
term he was host to the present King and
Queen, in 1927, and after his return to England
was associated with Westralian mining
ventures. Lady Campion is a member of
Byron’s family. Her nephew Rupert, the present
holder of the title, is farming in Westralia’s
wheatbelt. •
In Sydney, at 87, George Pitt, the first chair-
man of the Sydney Technical College Associa-
tion, which pioneered the move to transfer
students from the college to the university. A
particularly active philanthropic and educa-
tional worker.
At Dromana (Vic.) at 87, M. Paul Bibron,
probably Melbourne’s best-known teacher of
dancing. Up to 1940, when he retired, he
made old Admiralty House in Exhibition-street
a rendezvous for epicures as well as dancers.
He came to Australia from Tours, France, in
1883, and then went back to study under the
distinguished Espinosa.
At 89, in Melbourne, Mathew Bennett,
M.L.A., member for Gippsland West until he
retired last year as the oldest member of the
Victorian Parliament. He was one of the
Country party’s stalwarts after it merged with
the Farmers’ Union in 1928.

U.S.: “ARMED ISOLATION.”
If the disaster in Korea pro-
duced a European and British
reaction closely resembling the
jitters, the U.S. reaction has
been no less striking and could
easily be much more unfortunate
for the Western side.
The U.S. reaction is a very
clearly marked present trend
back to American isolationism,
with the single difference that
this time it would be an armed
isolation.
That is what has really been
lately advocated by ex-President
Hoover, in a severely-attacked
but nonetheless ominously signi-
ficant speech $ by leading Re-
publican Senator Robert Taft, in
several similarly ominous
speeches ; and by other quarters
not confined to the diehard isola-
tionist Press.
The trend has become vocal
as an echo of the fighting in
Korea and of the fact (as Ameri-
cans see it) that the U.S. was
left by other U.N.O. members to
bear the brunt of that fighting,
with very serious losses. The
danger is that, unless there is
very soon some better evidence
of willingness to get on with
defence preparations, and better
evidence by all the Western side
of willingness to fight if neces-
sary, the trend might prove too
strong for those who have guided
the new non-isolationist, collec-
tive-security American policy.
What makes the trend seem
particularly dangerous is that it
was noticed when things in
Korea were going reasonably
well, before the debacle hap-
pened, The correspondents in
America of the “Manchester
Guardian,” London “Times” and
the “Economist” all interpreted
the last Congressional election
result as a swing back to isola-
tionism. They were loftily re-
buked for it in sections of the
American Press, but it is now
the American Press itself which
is making a feature of the trend.
Thus, one of the most highly
regarded political commentators,
Walter Lippmann, has com-
mented :
“If what I am told by men
who have been out in the country
is correct, and what, as nearly
as I can judge from some good
samples, the letters pouring into
Washington signify, it is this:
After Korea, what the people
want is to increase the military
power of the United States and
to get out of entanglements like
Korea. There is little doubt, I
think, that the main tide is
running in the direction of an
armed isolation.”
The isolationist movement, in
Lippmann’s view, could take the
form of a demand for a with-
drawal from Europe or Asia,
“which is, of*course, what the
Kremlin wants more than any-
thing else on earth.” The same
commentator has also reported:
“There is indeed a rising tide
of isolationist sentiment in this
country. It could carry with it
a withdrawal that would take us
very far, perhaps as far as Mr.
Joseph P. Kennedy proposes—
that is to say, to the positions we
occupied in 1939,”
Lippmann sees the trend as
arising from the failures in
Korea and Germany of the
Truman Administration’s
“globalist policy”:
“In Korea it has come peril-
ously near to costing us the
flower of our Army. In Western
Germany the grossly misin-
formed, miscalculated and mis-
judged effort to rearm the Ger-
mans of our zone is misfiring
dangerously,
“Offered no choice except to
stand guard on the Yalu and the
Elbe or to withdraw to our
ocean frontiers, how after such
disasters could anything but a
movement to isolationism be
expected? Why in the name of
commonsense should anyone be
surprised that this nation is with-
drawing from the far places
where it has met defeat and
frustration in order to collect its
strength and to collect its wits?”
As a note on the future, he
adds; “A new doctrine which is
far short of the globalism of the
Truman Doctrine on the one
hand, and of the isolationism of
Mr. Kennedy on the other, will
have to be formulated if the
isolationist sentiment is not to
become irresistible and over-
whelming,”
The trend has also been lately
noted by correspondents of New
York “Herald Tribune”:
“A new extreme isolationism is
being bom of the defeatism that
now horribly pervades this con-
fused city [i.e., Washington], No
leading figure has as yet dared to
give public voice to this import-
ant trend. But all over Washing-
ton, in the lobbies of the Senate
and House, among the more
tremulous policymakers, and
even in the recesses of the
military staff the same subter-
ranean muttering is going on,
“Our Allies cannot be de-
pended on. We have not the
power to carry the burden of
world leadership alone. We
must ‘contract our commitments’
(the new catchword). We must
abandon first Asia and then
Europe to their fate. We must
retire into our own hemisphere,
which we can defehd. So goes
the story.”
The Scripps-Howard chain of
papers has run an editorial
stating: “The profound dissatis-
faction in this country with the
slow progress of European
defence plans in the gathering
storm is a serious threat to the
solidarity of the Atlantic com-
munity. Britain and France
must remedy this situation if
they expect the same whole-
hearted co-operation they had in
the past.”
As another example, by way
of indicating how widespread is
the U.S. noting of the trend, the
“Sioux City Journal” in lowa,
which has strongly supported the
recent U.S. collective-security
policy, now suggests that the
U.S. should make it plain that it
will do its best for the Western
European nations “if they keep
in step,” but should also “Then
tell them that if they do not, if
they try to wriggle out, if they
shirk their plain duty, if they
decide to let Uncle Sam do this
job of fighting by himself, they
will suffer the penalty of our
withdrawing from the whole
stinking mess and let them shift
for themselves. Yes, by all
means let us return to isolation-
ism if they fail to do their part.”
On the European side, too, the
trend is evidently being noticed,
which may be something to the
good. Thus, the Paris correspon-
dent of London “Times” says
in a recent report:
“The revival of isolationist
trends in the United States has
reminded Frenchmen of what is
really at stake behind the un-
pleasantness of new taxes and
sacrifices in a period of internal
prosperity. Suggestions that
France is the weak link in the
Atlantic defence system, and that
the French will to fight is at best
—New York “Herald Tribune."
TOWER OF BABEL.
doubtful, have stirred all those
who hitherto toyed with ideas of
neutrality.”
In Britain also more and more
notice is being taken of the
trend, A typical comment
(from London “Daily Tele-
graph”) :
“The fact that the bulk of the
forces engaged in Korea have
been American, that in spite of
the Marshall Plan and other
forms of American aid Western
Europe is still without an in-
tegrated defensive system, in-
evitably creates a feeling of
impatience which could turn into
hopelessness” (that is, in the
U.S.).
As one more representative
British example, L. S. Amery
concludes a long letter featured
in the “Times” and dealing tren-
chantly with British tardiness in
defence:
‘The nation must be con-
vinced that its leaders are in
earnest So, incidentally, must
America, if she is to help with
raw materials and equipment in
the spirit of lend-lease. It was
our spirit and our performance
in 1940, not our danger as such,
that secured lend-lease then.”
The “Times” itself is editor-
ially optimistic about what it
calls “the American debate” on
isolation. It thinks “It is
altogether better to have the
skeleton of the old isolationism
—or new nationalism, as some
would say—out in the open than
to have it clanking its chains in
the closet. Amerifans can now
take the measure of what it
means ; and many will come for-
ward, as they came forward 10
years ago, to lay the isolationist
ghost.”
Perhaps the “Times” optimism
about that is justified, but any-
one studying the American Press
and noting the speeches being
made by Taft and others must
reserve a doubt. The trouble
with spontaneous national trends
is that they are almost wholly
instinctive and do not go the
way that looks the soundest by
paper logic. In any case, the
isolationism “debate” will do
some good if it gives Western
Europe a different kind of a
fright from the Korean jitters
variety.
Both Sides for Peace.
The Dean of St. Paul’s, Dr.
W. R. Matthews, takes a look
at the armaments race:
“Armaments are piling up, the
forces are swelling. But we are
assured that they are to defend
peace. Both sides say this. It
seems that every gun, every tank
and every submarine produced is
to be regarded as one more
defence of peace.
“At least it is clear that no
one dares to say outright that he
is preparing for war. THe desire
of the common people of every
land for peace is too strong.
“We may hope that, in the
end, this desire of the masses
throughout the world will pre-
vail, and we shall escape the last
tragic absurdity of two mighty
armies equipped with atom-
bombs and all the latest scientific
instruments of slaughter rushing
into battle each bearing the
banner, ‘We fight for peace.’ ”
The Dean, at any rate, cannot
be called one-sided. The happy
alternative implicit in his re-
marks, of course, is that one of
the sides should not prepare to
“fight for peace.” Then there’d
be only one lot of villains.

“Turkey is about as remote from the
Korean war, physically, as it’s pos-

GRAF SPEE'S END
{Graf Spee, repeatedly hit, has
scuttled behind her smoke-
screen. Harwood is closing her
at top speed.}
THEY had gained 2\ miles
when the quarry turned to-
wards them and snarled a
trio of llin. salvos at
paper-thin Ajax. Any one of
those six-gun broadsides could
have blown her out of the water ;
as it was they exploded all round
her in a flung forest of water,
colored dirty yellow at the base
from bursting T.N.T.
The 6-inchers’ reaction was
characteristic and immediate;
they let go with everything.
Every seven seconds 16 high-
explosive armor-piercing shells
burst beside or aboard the
German; a brightly-glowing
fire blossomed on his midships
and he lumbered again for the
safety of his smoke. Before he
did he loosed a parting shot—it
hit Ajax on the after-superstruc-
ture. Armor-piercing, it bored
42ft, through several cabins, then
X-turret trunk, wrecked the
training and loading machinery
below the gunhouse, and finally
burst in the commodore’s sleep-
ing cabin. As well, part of its
base slammed against Y-turret’s
training-rack and jammed the
turret to a standstill. And it
killed four and wounded six of
X’s crew.
Graf Spec may have noticed
the falling-off of Ajax’s fire
through loss of two turrets; at
any rate, she turned to close the
range. Ajax was ready, and
bared her other teeth —a salvo
of four torpedoes at miles.
At once the big German forgot
his belligerency and resumed his
running course.
Again the British cruisers
steered to close the range.
Worrying, spitting and zig-
zagging like a brace of Kilkenny
cats they bore in, biting with
vivid red bursts at the German’s
armored hide. They drove in
almost to spud - throwing
distance —four miles, pretty well
point-blank. And they were
hitting Graf Spee continually.
He showed his concern by
firing torpedoes—missiles which,
once seen, must be avoided.
And the spotting aircraft did
see them, passing on her dis-
covery immediately to Harwood.
At once he altered course
under full rudder till he
had swung right round to due
south. Somewhere in the
distance the German torpedoes
slid harmlessly past, to sink, at
the end of their abortive run,
into the deep slime of the
Atlantic. There was grim satis-
faction on those fighting faces
on the British bridges—the
torpedo is the weapon of the
little fellow, a power-packed
punch he uses when things begin
to get out of hand ; the use of
them by an enemy mounting
llin. guns was as good as a
signal from the enemy of the
effect of their gunfire.
But Graf Spee’s gunnery was
more accurate than her
torpedoes; so much so that
Harwood decided to break off
the action and wait for dark.
Accordingly the cruisers made
smoke and turned to the east,
to shadow at about 15 miles.
Again, the German had a part-
ing shot, again at Ajax; it
brought down her maintopmast
and snapped all her aerials. Jury
wires were soon rigged.
The enemy made no attempt
to follow them, but steadied on
a course due west, steaming at
22 knots directly for the Plate.
Sipping hot cocoa on his
bridge, all about the acrid stench
of burnt cordite, Harwood re-
viewed the position. Below him
on the fo’c’sle sweating crews
from A and B turrets were busy
clearing empty cordite-cases
from around the shoots where
they’d been shot from the gun-
house, having delivered their
contents. From the galley
issued a sustaining stream of un-
dainty corned-beef sandwiches.
They found their repositories in
turrets, in the director high above
the bridge, in fumy engine-rooms
deep below water-line,
Down aft in the wardroom
the ship’s surgeon worked
intently over a pile of bloody
bandages laid on an operating-
table bolted to the deck. The
writer remembers a frothy
young thing aboard his cruiser
in Sydney asking why on earth
there were so many bits of iron
stuck in the floor of the ward-
room. This day they held the
collapsible legs of Ajax’s
operating-table the sickbay
forrard, small and unarmored,
was useless except as a dressing-
station. The surgeon looked up
a moment from what a steel
splinter had done to a chest-
wall, and gazed round at the
other limp objects waiting his
attention. He was thinking,
though you would never have
got him to admit it, of course,
that this was just right-half a
dozen wounded exercised his
slightly rusty fingers, found out
any faults in his first-aid organi-
sation, and ensured that the
members of it felt they were
doing something really useful.
Yes, just about right—not too
many, not too few.
Far below the surgeon, almost
on the ship’s bilges, magazine-
crews rapidly broke open fresh
cases of cordite ready for the
call to smack high-explosive food
into the hoists which delivered
it to the guns’ hungry bellies.
On his bridge in the clear
sunshine, gazing over the white-
flecked blue to where a distinc-
tive control-tower jutting above
the horizon betrayed the metal
which bore it, Harwood was not
concerned with these ’tween-
decks goings-on. No orders in
this meticulously-knit organisa-
tion were needed to initiate
them. He was thinking of
merchantmen in his enemy’s
path, of Cumberland’s eight
cold 8-inchers in the Falklands,
of the state of his ammunition.
He turned, and the signal-
yeoman was beside him.
“Signal Cumberland,” the
commodore said, “ ‘Close the
Plate at full speed.’ And pass
this signal to all merchantmen,
and Admiralty.”
In a minute the ether was
charged with Graf Spec’s posi-
tion, course and speed. And in
an oak-lined room in faraway
Whitehall several officers, heavy
with experience and gold braid,
bent over their chart to mark a
new position.
On across the white-flecked
sea Graf Spee trailed the hunt,
the British guns laid constantly
on the conspicuous fighting-top
visible far ahead. Then Achilles,
overestimating the enemy’s
speed, closed to 11. miles. A
salvo landing close alongside in
a slamming blast and vicious
whine of splinters sent her scut-
tling back to her long-range
snadowing position.
Harwood could hardly believe
his eyes when he saw, at the
top of a signal the yeoman
handed him, in the square
marked “From,” the address
“Graf Spee.” But it was from
his enemy, and asked, in a form
of chivalry which was to be sub-
merged under the bitter years of
fighting ahead, “Please pick up
lifeboats of English steamer.”
Then they sighted, close to Graf
Spee ahead, a merchantman,
stopped and blowing-off steam.
When Ajax came up with her
she signalled that she was the
Britisher Shakespeare and that
she was quite all right. The last
the gladiators saw of her was a
smoke-smear trailing urgently to
the south.
Shortly afterwards Exeter
signalled Harwood that all her
turrets were now out of action,
she was flooded for the greater
area of her forepart, but that she
could still raise 18 knots. She
had done all she could —
Harwood ordered her out of it,
down to the Falklands. She
later made an English dockyard,
to refit for the fight of her life
in the Java Sea.
There were no further
incidents till 7.15 pan., when
Graf Spee swung round, bore all
guns on Ajax, and let go. The
first broadside fell short and
directly in line. Ajax promptly
altered course for the spouts—
and the next lot erupted dead in
her wake as she turned.
There were a few more
exchanges, mainly by Graf Spee
to keep her shadowers at bay.
Even so, Achilles closed to
within five miles by 10 p.m,,
with the German nicely
silhouetted against the afterglow
in the west, and then her black
bulk outlined against the lights
of Montevideo.
Graf Spee proceeded north of
the English Bank and anchored
in Montevideo Roads at 50
minutes after midnight.
Harwood reported that his
chief preoccupation at that time
was how long Graf Spee in-
tended to stay there. With the
By "MACNELL”
mam action concluded, and the
enemy, for the present, safe
inside territorial immunity, let’s
cross to the Fiihrer’s head-
quarters to find the answer to
the commodore’s worry.
On December 16 Admiral
Raeder, C.-in-C. of the German
Navy, consulted Hitler and
presented him with this report
of his appreciation of the
battle temporarily suspended
thousands of miles away.
“At least two weeks are
needed to make the Graf Spee
seaworthy, and the Government
of Uruguay has granted only 72
hours, TTie Foreign Office is
requested to continue efforts to
obtain an extension of the time
allowed; this appears hopeless,
however, as Britain and France
are exerting great pressure.
[Raeder was misinformed—the
British Ambassador was polling
every string to hold the Ger-
man longer, for obvious rea-
sons.] Uruguay is unreliable
as a neutral, and is not able to
defend her neutrality. Intern-
ment in Montevideo is therefore
out of the question. A break-
through to Argentina, which is
stronger, could be considered,
since that would permit us to
retain greater freedom of action.
The commander of the Graf
Spee has proposed a break-
through to Buenos Aires, and
he requests a decision as to
whether, if the prospect is hope-
less, he should choose intern-
ment in Montevideo or scuttle
the ship in the fairly shallow
waters of the La Plata River.”
Captain Langsdorff radioed
this information the same day:
“1. —Strategic position off
Montevideo; Besides the
cruisers and destroyers, Ark
Royal and Renown. [This was a
false position, created by skilful
British propaganda. Ark Royal
and Renown were actually many
thousands of miles away.
Harwood’s only reinforcement
was Cumberland, though he
hoped for some heavy stuff
within five days.] Close
blockade at night. Escape into
open sea and break-through to
home waters hopeless.
“2. —Propose putting out as
far as neutral boundary. If it is
possible to fight our way through
to Buenos Aires, using remain-
ing ammunition, this will be
attempted.
“3. —If a break - through
would result in certain destruc-
tion of Graf Spee without
opportunity of damaging enemy,
request decision on whether the
ship should be scuttled in spite
of insufficient depth in the
estuary of the La Plata, or
whether internment is to be
preferred.
“4. —Request decision by
radiogram.
(Sgd.) Commander, Graf Spee.”
These were the orders Langs-
dorff received:
“L —Attempt by all means to
extend the time in neutral waters
in order to guarantee freedom
of action as long as possible.
[Remember that though this was
exactly what the British were
striving for, the Germans be-
lieved that reinforcements had
already arrived.]
“2. —With reference to No. 2:
approved.
“3. —With reference to No. 3:
No internment in Uruguay.
Attempt effective destruction if
ship is scuttled.
(Sgd.) Raeder.”
On the following morning,
watched by a vast crowd of
sightseers, Graf Spec put to sea.
While the foregoing corres-
pondence between cronies was
going on, Harwood was going
about his business, outside. He
made a signal of his own.
“My object destruction.
Necessitates concentrating our
forces. Increased risk of enemy
escape accepted. Cumberland is
to watch to west of English
Bank, showing herself off Monte-
video in daylight. If enemy
leaves before 2100 [9 p.m.], ships
in touch shadow at maximum
range—all units concentrate on
shadower,”
Harwood made other posi-
tioning signals, and received
one—to the effect that his enemy
had landed a funeral-party, and
that she had been hit between
60 and 70 times. Another sig-
nal, from Admiralty, told him
he was free to engage Graf Spec
anywhere outside the three-mile
limit.
He decided then to remove his
patrol further to seaward, “as I
considered that a battle in the
very restricted waters just out-
side the three-mile limit was im-
practicable, owing to lack of sea-
room, and possibility of ‘overs
landing in Uruguay and causing
international complications.”
Up and down five miles out-
side the British pack steamed
teeth bared, waiting, ready
Well clear of the others, so that
her line of fire was unmasked
crept cruiser Cumberland, the
eight long unblooded snouts o::
her Sin. guns sniffing towards the
Plate, ready at the press of
trigger to fling a broadside or
over a ton of armor-piercing
metal. Her heavily-gunnec
length was a great comfort to
the other game little terriers.
Then, on Sunday, December
17 Harwood received a re-
port from shore that Graf
Spee had landed the welding
equipment she had borrowed to
make good her damage. The
report sent the British sailors
scurrying to their guns. At 3.40
p.m, he received another signal,
even more electrifying;
“Graf Spee is weighing
anchors.”
Harwood at once altered
course to close the Whistle Buoy
in the mouth of the Plate, and
increased to 25 knots. Ajax’s
aircraft was catapulted and
sailed away towards the town.
She must have seemed like a
vulture to the German sailors.
Then Ajax’s receiving radio
woke to life. The reports came
in quick succession from her
aircraft. Graf Spee was pro-
ceeding slowly to the westward.
Now she is in shallow water six
miles south-west of Montevideo.
Then, a psean of triumph, “Graf
Spee has blown herself up!”
Harwood heard the message
from his signal-yeoman. He did
not answer at first, just stood
silent with his hands on the
compass beside the wheelhouse
voice-pipe down which he had
passed so many orders —orders
which had culminated in the flux
of flame visible as a fiery curtain
fighting the gathering night over
the starb’d bow. Then he
turned to his navigator, and in
a voice tired with strain, yet
vibrant with suppressed feeling,
gave the last order of that epic
action —the navigational direc-
tion to steam the British
squadron within four miles of
the Whistle Buoy and the
funeral pyre of the enemy they’d
fought to the death.
Guns’-crews fell out, to crowd
the guard-rails and stare in awe
at the leaping fuel-fed blaze
close to starb’d. It was now
completely dark. Graf Spee was
ablaze from end to end, flames
roaring in almost solid sheets
clear to the tops of her masts,
their whipping peaks pouring a
pall of black smoke to the watch-
ing sky. She was almost
awash, listing critically
to starb’d, the painted bow-wave
on her side sweeping back from
her stem clearly visible in the
lurid light, giving her still the
impression of graceful speed
and movement. It was merely
an impression—the actuality
was ignominious death.
Three days later, the 20th, the
final act was played. Captain
Hans Langsdorff shot himself,
leaving this letter addressed to
the German Ambassador, and
meant for onward transmission
to Germany and his Flihrer:
“19/12//39.
“To the Ambassador,
Buenos Aires.
“Your Excellency,
“After a long struggle I
reached the grave decision to
scuttle the pocket-battleship
Admiral Graf Spec, in order to
prevent her from falling into
enemy hands. I am still con-
vinced that under the circum-
stances this decision was the
only one left, once I had taken
my ship into the trap of Monte-
video. For with the ammuni-
tion remaining any attempt to
fight my way back to open and
deep water was bound to fail.
Sooner than expose my ship to
the danger that after a brave
fight she would fall partly or
completely into enemy hands, I
decided not to fight, but to de-
stroy the equipment and then
scuttle the ship. It was clear to
me that this decision might be
or unwittingly mis-
construed *by persons ignorant
of my motives, as being attri-
butable entirely or partly to
personal considerations. There-
fore, I decided from the be-
ginning to bear the consequences
involved in this decision. For
a captain with a sense of honor,
it goes without saying that his
personal fate cannot be
separated from that of his ship.
“I postponed’my intention as
long as I still bore responsibility
for decisions concerning the
welfare of the crew under my
command. After today’s de-
cision of the Argentine Govern-
ment, I can do no more for my
ship’s company. Neither will I
be able to take an active part
in the present struggle of my
country. I can now only prove

Spee.”
According to his lights, an
honorable letter, and a brave de-
cision. But—“l can only prove
by my death that the fighting
services of the Third Reich are
ready to die for the honor of
the flag”—irresistibly recalls
that dying for the honor of the
flag is no German monopoly;
except that the White Ensign
seems to call for, from those who
served it, a different sort of
death —Yarra, Perth, Jervis Bay,
Glowworm, Rawalpindi. All
these ships were trapped by a
superior enemy, and all died
fighting. . , ,

Harwood, a full admiral, re-
tired in 1945 from the service he
had served for 45 years because
of ill-health. He died in June,

initiator of a naval battle which
will go down in history as a text-

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
‘‘Fogging” of Sheep.
“Outback”: C. A. Bowhay,
Buckinbah, St. George (Q.), has
had excellent results in the con-
trol of sheep-lice with a T.I.F.A.
plant he installed in June last.
In June-July he fogged 10,000
sheep straight off shears, using
a B.H.C. fog, and he has had
practically no trouble with lice
since, although 1950 was one of
the worst years for lice Queens-
land has experienced.
A few of the older stud ewes
are now showing a few lice, but
a fair quantity of wool was left
on their heavy fronts by the
shearers. Bowhay intended using
fogging to protect his sheep
against blowfly strike until the
C.5.1.R.0. reported that it would
not recommend fogging for that
purpose. However, he did fog
about 1000 ewes and lambs with
B.H.C. in the open air, very late
in the afternoon, with excellent
results. He had practically no
strike amongst the lambs,
although it was a particularly
bad fly-strike period. There was
some strike when D.D.T. was
used. About 20 per cent, of his
untreated lambs were struck.
Bowhay considers that on his
results the C.5.1.R.0. should re-
vise its opinion concerning the
efficacy of fogging for control
of body-strike in circumstances
such as those experienced in
Queensland this season. The
fact that sheep could be fogged
immediately after shearing, with
the one muster only, meant a
great saving of labor compared
with routine dipping.
Better Lambings.
“Bungaree”; In w ormy
districts, ewes should be
drenched at least once before
lambing. Use phenothiazme for
preference, but don’t drench
closer than one month to lamb-
ing, and, if possible, put ewes
into a spelled paddock after this
drenching.
Where lambing is likely to be
prolonged and where paddocks
are available, a system involving
the raddling of rams on the
brisket will obviate much disturb-
ing of ewes during the lambing
period. In U.S.A. rams are
fitted with a light harness carry-
ing a cake of raddle under the
brisket. Color of the raddle is
changed every fortnight, then
ewes are drafted into flocks of
similar color. Each flock should
then lamb in consecutive periods
of a fortnight each, thus per-
mitting more intense care and
supervision and at the same time,
a minimum of disturbance for
those still to lamb.
Marking losses can be con-
trolled by cleanliness and steady,
organised work as opposed to
"I saved it by burnin' a firebreak round it.”
hell-for-leather, record-breaking
attempts. Avoid like the plague
the man who brags about the
number of lambs he has marked
or sheep he can drench in a day.
In districts where flystrike has to
be reckoned with, mulesing is
sometimes done at marking.
Vaccination for pulpy-kidney
and/or scabby-mouth may also
be necessary. It has been
stressed for years and can bear
repetition that marking should
be done at a temporary yard in
the paddock, where the minimum
of driving and holding time will
keep down mismothering.
When the operation is com-
plete, catchers should drop the
lamb on its four feet —not on
its rump. Marking wounds will
heal quicker without a dressing.
If flies are troublesome, use a
repellant or some mild non-
irritant dressing. Don’t put it
on with a swab —spray it on.
A swab or brush picks up dirt
and germs and distributes them.
Before starting marking, take
several hours to collect and pre-
pare the gear. Touch up knives,
earmarking pliers and mulesing
shears with an oilstone. Then
sterilise the lot by covering with
water in a clean tin or saucepan
and boiling for 10 minutes. Be
even more careful in sterilising
the hypodermic syringes—always
have a spare one, they are easily
broken —also the needles. Don’t
forget to take the syringe to
pieces before boiling, otherwise
the expansion of the metal
'plunger will crack the glass
cylinder. During marking opera-
tions keep hypo.-needles in a
covered dish of methylated
spirits. Also have a bucket con-
taining Dettol or some reliable
disinfectant to hold shears,
knives and pliers on the job.
Keep vaccines in as cool a
place as possible —right out of
the sun—and if there is dust,
put instrument and vaccine table
on the windward side of the
yard. In any case that is where
you should be operating.
In a wet year like 1950, lambs
picked up almost every sheep
disease possible and losses were
very heavy. In a normal year,
however, dirty marking yards
and dirty instruments cause
blood-poisoning, tetanus and
arthritis. 4 -
Between marking and weaning
the lamb has to be kept growing
without a check. Worst enemy
at this period is internal para-
sites, and the age at which
drenching should commence will
depend on the weather and the
district. This wet season worm
larvae have polluted pastures to
a degree never before reached
in this country, and as a result
lambs have been dying from
worm-infestation at eight weeks
of age. In any case, even in a
moderately healthy season, it is
good policy to drench all lambs
at weaning.
The post-weaning period is
perhaps the most vulnerable in
the life of a lamb. If flies and
worms are active keep a constant
eye on the weaners. Drench
every three weeks if the weather
is showery. If there is the least
possibility of bodystrike, dip or
spray the weaners with 1 per
cent. D.D.T. before the flies get
busy.
Grass-seed is another bugbear.
If no clean paddocks are avail-
able and they are picking up
seed, a swim will sometimes ease
things a bit. One of the worst
features of grass-seed is that the
punctures allow the entry of all
sorts of wogs, resulting in skin
abscesses, blackleg, blood-
poisoning and anthrax.
Black-rot in Crucifers.
"‘“Nubis”: It is caused by a
fungus, and all crucifers are sus-
ceptible. It shows first as a
blackening of the small veins
near the leaf margin ; later, the
leaves become brown and
wilted. It soon spreads to the
large leafstacks and main stem,
but can only be seen in these
on cross-sectioning. Crucifers
with fleshy roots (turnips,
swedes, radishes, etc.) may be
affected below ground.
Spread of the disease is in-
creased by spray-watering in
seed-beds; also by insect bites.
To control, disinfect the seed—
immerse it in hot water
(122 deg. F.) for 15 minutes
(cabbage seed 25 minutes).
Locate the seed-bed on new soil,
well away from the vegetable
garden. Eradicate host weeds
(wild turnip, etc.). Don’t use
sprinklers use furrow irriga-
tion between rows. Spray with
insecticide to eliminate biting
insects.
Always use new ground for
crucifers (a crop rotation of at
least three years). Infected soil
may be fumigated with formalin.
To do this, loosen-up the soil
and apply Igal. of 2 p.c.
formalin solution to the square
foot. (To prepare the solution
add Igal. of commercial
formalin to 49gal. of water).
Smooth the soil and cover with
bags moistened with the solu-
tion. Leave for four days. Then
remove the bags and loosen the
soil to permit the fumes to
escape. Sterilise digging imple-
ments in boiling water or
formalin solution before use.
After about a fortnight, the
ground can be sown.
Wet-season Seedlings.
“BUI C”: The N.Q. wet
season prevents the raising of
early veges seedlings unless
shelter is provided for the beds.
Make good-sized square beds,
edging them with stones or logs
to prevent stormwater washing
them away. A big plot may be
divided into sections for dif-
ferent plants.
Set stout forked saplings at
each comer of the bed, ram-
ming the soil in tightly, and run
crosspieces between them. This
frame should be stout enough
to carry a roof of corrugated-
iron. The iron should point east
and west, and be at least 3ft.
above the seed-bed. If the
supports are slightly higher on
the east than on the west it will
let the morning sun reach the
bed better and run off the rain.
It may take a little experi-
ence tp get this cover working
properly, but we have grown
thousands of good, early seed-
lings beneath such a shelter.
Maintaining Small
Generators.
“Radian”: A d.c. generator
may be either compound- or
shunt-wound, depending on type
and size of the plant. Com-
pound-wound generators are
usually employed on larger
plants and may be run on open-
circuit without damage—that is,
THE WEATHER.
By Inigo Jones.
The Queensland rains and cyclone came as forecast. More
rain is due shortly; as in the last manifestation of the main
cycle in 1879 it began about 20th January. Just at present
there are no spots whatever visible on the sun, and the new
group to intensify this rain has not yet appeared. When
these rains do come they should give fairly general results;
heavy in the tropics and down the coast to the northern
rivers of New South Wales and getting lighter as the
distance increases from these parts till they are light in the
west. The west, however, showed some very heavy rains
in 1879 on the upper Darling in February and fairly heavy
all down the river but again this may not be repeated in’
just the same way. The main wet season from the tropics
seems likely to last till late April, but in 1879 Easter was
clear in between heavy rains, so holiday-makers may hope
that it will be clear again.

with all external wiring discon-
nected. They also may be wired
to supply lights and all types of
appliances without having a
battery in circuit. The shunt-
wound generator is common to
cars, trucks and small lighting
plants where the main considera-
tion is battery-charging.
If an open-circuit occurs be-
tween the generator and bat-
teries, excessive internal heating
will usually burn out the arma-
ture windings, or melt the solder
and throw wires off the com-
mutator. For this reason all
electrical connections where an
open - circuit could develop
should be kept clean and tight.
Battery terminals are one of
the worst offenders by reason of
excessive corrosion set up
through seepage of the acid.
Terminals that show signs of
sulphation should be removed,
washed clean in a solution of
washing-soda and hot water,
then scraped bright on their
contact surfaces. Battery-poles
should be scraped clean before
the terminals are replaced and
tightened-up. A light applica-
tion of grease will slow down
further corrosion for a long
time.
Contact-points on the cut-
out, voltage regulator, or reverse
current relay whichever is
fitted —should be checked regu-
larly and cleaned with a contact-
stone.
If a mercury break relay is
fitted, make sure that there is
always sufficient mercury in the
jars for fingers to dip well below
the surface, in the closed
position.
Before working on any live
fittings it pays to disconnect
one battery lead, and so prevent
the risk of short-circuits. Deli-
cate parts can be seriously
damaged by a short and are
often hard to replace.
A generator that has been
idle for some time often refuses
to function through loss of
residual magnetism. If this fault
is suspected run at normal speed,
and touch the leads from a
battery to the generator
terminals, applying positive
battery to positive generator.
Ail things being in order, the
generator will function, and if
in regular use will give no
further trouble.
Conserving Natural Hay.
“Agric”: Des Collings, Col-
well, McKinlay (Q.), will have
10,000 bales of Flinders-,
Mitchell- and a small proportion
of button-grasses this season,
and would have had more but
for the shortage of labor.
From the previous season’s
harvest, which was light, the
hay, when chaffed by a chaff-
cutter and sweetened with
molasses, was fed to the ram
flock, and Collings opines that
this resulted in increased fertility
among his flock, yielding a better
percentage of lambs. In future
he intends to feed his ewes, in
the hope of still further in-
creased fertility.
Considerable acreages have to
be mown to ensure enough hay
for satisfactory preparation of
windrows, to warrant the use of
his fast automatic New Holland
baler. The effect of the hot
climate on hay was soon re-
vealed. One acre produced from
15 to 26 bales of hay of an
average weight of 45 to 50
pounds. It was noticed that
before cutting the grasses did
not have more than 25 per cent,
moisture content, and it was
decided to reduce the curing
period to three or four hours,
instead of 24 or more, and the
average bale weight increased to
65 to 75 pounds. The hay was
much greener, and it was antici-
pated that it would retain more
smell and taste when fed to
stock.
In areas of good grass-growth
some 30 to 35 bales weighing
651 b. were obtained per acre.
Considerable difficulty had to be
overcome before the grass could
be cut successfully. Short tufts
(of Mitchell particularly),
moulded with earth up to 6in.
from the ground, clogged the
mowers, which had to be set
higher. This resulted in the loss
of a certain quantity of grass.
but it is thought the return
growth and/or regeneration will
more than compensate for this
loss. In cutting the grass, a
diesel tracked-tractor is used
with a 30ft tractor hitch, to
which are attached three 6ft.
trailer-type mowers and two 9ft.
side delivery rakes, these allow-
ing one man with a tractor to
cut and rake 18ft. of grass in a
single operation. An average
cut in eight hours is 25 to 30
acres.
Hints for the Farm.
“Old Crab”: If you load your
pigs from a roofed and boarded-
in shed or sty, through a chute,
into truck or trailer, you’ve
noticed your baconers jib when
they see the daylight. Run
hessian or bags along your
chute (or board it up) and you’ll
speed up your loading.
“Big Billy”: Protect rock-
melons from excess moisture by
stretching a canvas sheet or
frame over them. If this is not
done the flavor will be impaired
and the fruit become watery and
insipid.
“Inc”: There seems to be
something in the idea that the
strained dregs from the teapot,
added to their food or drinking
water once a day, will protect
domestic pets against ticks.
“Waverly”: Tomatoes will-
root from cuttings consisting of
side-shoots from the axils of
leaves. This will supply a few
plants for late fruiting, and they
will bear earlier than December-
sown seed. Choose strong cut-
tings from non-diseased plants
and keep under glass away from
sunlight for the first fortnight.
“Myrr”! If pumpkins or roots
are fed to pigs, give them a con-
centrate, preferably in the form
of grain and crushed —3ylb.
daily for each pig, plus ilb. of
meatmeal. When cereals with-
out separated milk are fed, a
mineral lick (four parts of
crushed limestone to one part of
salt) is a necessity.

SPORTING NOTIONS
At times in the past Sydney race-
clubs have come under fire for allow-
ing excessive optimism to lead them
into a foolish, right-to-the-last-minute
pretence that a meeting would take
place as scheduled, when existing
weather conditions have made it most
palpable that a postponement was
inevitable. However, even the most
super-optfinists could scarcely turn a
blind eye to* the moisture which hit
Sydney last week. In a matter of
three days some 12 inches of rain
fell on Rosehill racecourse; by mid-
day Friday the S.T.C. had accepted
the inevitable. The meeting was post-
poned to today (Wednesday), when
horses which impress as likely to
shape well are Oreel, Caphua, Royal
Andrew, Golden Bird, School Belle,
Beau Sandy, Valley Forge and Apex.
Without the benefit of the Rosehill
meeting to either instruct or contuse
one, a glance may be %ken at the
Challenge Stakes-Anniversary Handi-
cap double. On Saturday (weather, of
course, permitting) San Domenico
will attempt to bring off a hat-trick
of Challenge Stakes successes. This
has not been done by any horse pre-
viously, a fact which in itself seems
to weigh against San Domenico’s
chances. Weighing even more heavily
against him, however, is the plaster
of 9,13 he’ll have on his back.
In 1949 San Domenico won the
Challenge with 8.5; that was only his
seventh start in a race, and his fifth
win. Last year the Hua gelding
carried 9.10, conceded other runners
from 221 b. to 451 b. and, clocking
I.los, won by a neck from High Jip,
who carried 7.8, and who later in the
year won the Newmarket with 7.7.
That, of course, was a great win of
San Domenico’s, but at the same time
the handicapper very nearly had his
measure then, and he may prove to
really have it this year, especially since
the field seems likely to be of better
quality than last year’s.
Imported Donegal will be nearest
San Domenico in the weights, with
9.5; then follow (with final accept-
ances yet to be made) Field Boy (9.3),
Hesdin (8.12), Warrah King (8.9),
Pantomime (8.8), Acquittal (8.8) and
Buzmark (8.3). Although there are,
lower down the weights, some
fairish speedsters who could bob-up,
it is from the abovementioned first
few in the weights that the Challenge
winner can be best expected to come.
Overlooking his failure m the mile
Villiers, and looking back rather to
the performances which led to bis
being strongly fancied for the Vilhers,
Hesdin is present observer’s fancy tor
the Challenge, with San Domenico
and Buzmark the next-best.
With a poorish bunch of stayers
engaged, weights for the Anniversary
Handicap are on a rather lower scale
all round than in the Challenge. Ot
40 horses still in at time of writing,
only five are rated at Bst. _or better.
They are Chitral, * Denali, Persist,
Yamboon and Crag Son. Persist is
sure to be strongly fancied, and, of
course, must be conceded a show,
but this mare has built up a list of
convictions which take more than
courage to overlook. Present ob-
server’s fancy is another mare in
lolanda. Ballroom, Great World and
Persist may be reckoned the greatest
dangers, with consistent Captain
Roddy the best of the lightweights.

The prediction/ventured upon here
last week that River Hero was worth
watching for a while bore early fruit.
Backed in from tens, to start even-
tually at 13 to 2, the Hellespont horse
had a comfortable win in Saturday’s
Barton Handicap at Caulfield.
A 51b. allowance for apprentice J.
Kerr reduced River Hero’s burden to
8.7 —a luxury weight fqr a horse who
has won over the Flemington straight-
six with 9.13. As well, River Hero
had a much more favorable barrier
position than the one which had
beaten him the previous week.
Smartly away, well up with them all
the way, and in front when they
turned for home, River Hero scored
by something more than a length from
Carnage and Winlake, and cut out
the six furlongs in I.los— only a
quarter of a second outside the course
record.
River Hero represents pretty well
the ultimate in stiff luck with a race-
horse. Although obviously all the cut
of a champion sprinter, he has been
prevented by perennial rheumatism
from rising to anything approaching
the true level of his ability. And, if
that were not enough, this beautifully-
bred and fine-looking stallion —all the
makings of a splendid sire—is, purely
because of a technicality, ineligible
for the Stud Book. He is a son of
Hellespont and the Melbourne Cup
winner Rivette, but the mating was
not registered as required.
The aged gelding Chatspa has given
his owner O. R. Porter some tiptop
wins, but he has almost as often been
the cause of the Porter digits being
badly burnt. Patron looked the
logical favorite for the 12-furlongs
Deakin Handicap, but by the time
Porter and connections had finished
backing their opinion Chatspa started
favorite at twos, with Patron at
9 to 4. Lady Nora was the only
other at all in demand, and the
fancied trio duly filled the places,
though not in the order foreseen by
the Chatspa people. The camera’s
verdict on a tight finish was that
Patron had pipped Lady Nora by a
half-head; Chatspa finished well, but
all too late, to be three-parts of a
length away, third.
The failure of odds-on favorite
Bahadur in the Kingston Stakes, a
set-weights affair for two-year-olds,
appeared to peeve a fair number of
onlookers, who forthwith “demon-
strated,” but the Dhoti colt’s defeat
did not altogether surprise those with
whom present observer agrees in
viewing with misgivings the over-
racing of two-year-olds. The present
crop of youngsters has been
racing for something less than six
months. In that period Bahadur has
had a dozen starts, for five wins and
only once unplaced. On Saturday
Bahadur was beaten most comfortably
by the Blue Moon colt Moonpath.

Continuing to impress as one of
the most promising of the younger
apprentices, R. Irons rode a splendid
race to win the mile Mitchell Handi-
cap on Siren Song. Dashing away
to a big lead entering the straight,
Irons completely stole a march on the
wily senior hoop W. Williamson, who
rode the warm favorite Black Don.
Siren Song started at 12 to 1, and
beat the favorite by three lengths,
with Law List a similar distance
further back.

Every lawn-tennis championship,
State or national, held at the N.S.W.
Association’s White City courts since
1946 has been spoiled by rain. It
seems a rather grim omen for the
next Davis Cup challenge round,
which is scheduled for the same
arena. Latest upset has been in the
current Australian chlmpionships.
Originally due to commence on Tues-
day last week, they were actually just
getting under way as this went to the
printer. Great interest in the present
championships lies in the anticipation
of another Sedgman-Larsen singles
final. Sedgman so far is two-up on
Larsen, having won the Q’land, Vic-
torian and South Australian State
titles while the American came out
on top in the N-S.W. tournament.
However, the Australian title is the
one which Larsen will be really trying
his utmost to win, and it is an odd
fact that while he’s a world beater
anywhere else Sedgman has had
singularly little luck in major tourna-
ments at White City.

Following defeat in the third Test
the M.C.C. tourists retired to lick
their wounds on the Apple Isle, an
environ pleasingly suited to such pur-
suit. The said wounds, as a matter
of fact, had reached such proportions
that skipper Fred Brown was forced
to cable headquarters an urgent SOS
for reinforcements. These arrived last
week in the shapes of Brian Statham
and Roy Tattersall, a couple of much-
needed trundlers.
Meanwhile, scraping together all fit
personnel, together with walking
wounded, and as well co-opting the
unofficial Bedser twin, the tourists
proceeded to Tassie. At Hobart they
turned on a hurricane second innings
to beat Tasmania by nine wickets.
Tasmania hit up 192 and 229; M.C.C.
replied, with 234 and a second innings
188 for one wicket in 85 piinutes.

The success of the Australian eight-
oar crew at the Christchurch (N.Z.)
Centenary Games recently inspired
one of the most priceless, typically-
American bits of oblique self-praise
yet heard. In a heat, and again
in the final, the Australians defeated
an American crew of high repute
from the University of California;
they beat the Americans for the third
time in the New Zealand champion-
ships, after which the American
coach Ky Ebright declared that the
Australians were “undoubtedly the
best crew in the world.” Paid a trifle
of £7OOO per annum for his services
(so we are assured by a Sydney G.P.S.
honorary coach), Mr. Ebright earns
his screw by at least turning out
“undoubtedly the second-best crew in
the world.”

A former amateur champion of
Australia, Billy Barber (9.9), won a
reasonably comfortable points deci-
sion over Alex Stangaciu (9.10) at
Leichhardt last week. Stangaciu, Who
hails from Rumania, is a rather
wild-and-woolly fighter of the south-
paw persuasion. He got in some
pretty rough work on such occasions
as he found himself at close quarters
with Barber, but for the most part
Stangaciu’s wild swings seemed more
likely to produce rain than a knock-
out.

Jack Read cogitates the departed
glory of Australian boxing:
Boxing here has never been at so
low an ebb. Why? In my opinion
it is due to an almost total absence
of capable teachers, and, nearly as
important, the fact that principal
powers controlling the game them-
selves know little about boxing;
many of our promoters are hard-
pressed to distinguish between a right
cross and a boston crab. A notable
exception, and one which proves the
point, is Newcastle Stadium, which is
controlled by Hughie Dwyer, a former
triple champion of Australia; there
are always good boxers on hand and
good fights to be seen at Newcastle.
One thing a livewire promoter
would do is make our national cham-
pions defend their titles as often as
possible. As it is, these titles are
fast becoming practically meaningless.
Just look over the list. Tire cham-
pions are: flyweight, Mickey Hill;
bantam, Elley Bennett; feather, Bernie
Grant; lightweight, Jack Hassen;
welter, Mickey Tollis; while Dave
Sands holds the middip, light-heavy
and heavyweight titles.
Hill won his title from Taffy Han-
cock in February, 1950, and has not
defended it since.
Bennett took the bantam title from
Mickey Francis in April, 1948, and
has not defended *it since.
Grant became recognised as
feather champ, after beating Mickey
McDonald in November, 1949. He
successfully defended in a return
match with McDonald one month
later, and has not engaged in a title
bout since.
Hassen won the lightweight title
in September, 1949, and has not
defended it since. After being beaten
by a string of importations Hassen
recently won a bout with Ken Bailey
in Sydney. On that occasion Hassen
scaled half-a-stone over the light-
weight limit.
Tollis is the most recent champion,
having collected his title from Kev
Delaney on September 1, 1950. How-
ever, there is no indication that he
is at all likely to defend his title
within six months of winning it, as
is allegedly required under Australian
championship rules.
As for the triple titleholder Sands,
he bagged his three crowns in 1946,
when he took the middleweight from
Jack Kirkham on May 11, the light-
heavy from Jack Johnson on August
24 and the heavyweight from Johnson
on October 12. In the four years or
so since Sands has had one solitary
title fight; he successfully defended
his heavyweight laurels against Alf
Gallagher in September last year.


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIMD
The contributor placed first is paid
4id. per line; all others 2j|cL per line.
MacArthur
The pack is already yelling at Mac-
Arthur’s heels, and what a pack it is!
Remember their appalling record of
appeasement in Korea, with appease-
ment’s customary disastrous conse-
quences, their arguments over whether
we should cross the 38th Parallel, stop
well short of the Manchurian border, and
the monstrous military time-wasting that
followed, the childishness of their wishful
thinking that if we observed some such
obscure “niceties” we would not “pro-
voke” Red China?
What claptrap it all was and is! I
can imagine nothing more ridiculous than
the present spectacle of Red China being
absolved of blame for its invasion of
Korea and MacArthur being saddled with
it instead. Could anything be more
fantastic when the one thing clear in the
Asiatic picture is the Soviet intention to
kick us out of China come what may?
On the face of it, that may happen fairly
soon.
But all is not lost yet; MacArthur’s
critics should wait a little longer—he
is a fool who would sell the general short.
I came to know him fairly well during
the Pacific War when I was correspon-
dent for the London “Daily Express,”
certainly well enough to know that he
is a patient military thinker who will not
commit men to useless slaughter—which
is generally the result of the last-ditch
stands for which some of us are now
yelling our heads off.
Some of his professed friends do him
almost as much injustice as his critics.
A Sydney daily, for instance, in a mixture
of apology and half-hearted praise,
remarked,
These rhetorical and attitudinising military
leaders always leave the impression
—maybe unjust—that they regard war
as a robust game invented to exercise their
special talents.
And that when no general could be more
sparing of his men. His pride and joy is
his ability to hit the enemy “where they
ain’t.” Which also brings me to note
rather sadly that the same paper hit
him “where he weren’t”:
Okinawa, Saipan, Iwo Jima —any one df
these victories would have been sufficient to
win a general his place in the sun.
Those, of course, were Admiral Nimitz’s
shows which, because of their cost in
lives, MacArthur deplored.
One thing more. I wish the Press
and others would ignore the “God and I”
fictions. If MacArthur, although with
circumspection and decency, invokes the
name of the Almighty a little too fre-
quently for most of us, it is only because
his faith is stronger and more real than
ours and because he sincerely believes
that he is fighting on the side of right.
Who is there among us who will deny
him that?— Henry Keys (N.S.W.).
Labor
An acute shortage of labor for basic
industries is one result of “full employ-
ment,” and a mad rush is always on for
staff. All sorts of lures and enticements
are held out so that Jessie the ’teenager
or Joe the schoolboy will come and work
for Whosit and Co., where, according to
the radio and newspaper advertisements,
everything is offered from free lunches
to an associate directorate. Wages are
played up with overtime cunningly
worked in to inflate the weekly wage but
never a suggestion of working for these
wages.
Strangely enough the P.M.G puts
over the biggest blurb of all, mostly on
the radio, and a dazzling picture is
painted of all the money you get for so
little effort. Free shopping time, short
hours, high wages, all amenities —they all
get plugged, but nary a word of work.
One day an employer will make the
astounding discovery that some prospec-
tive employees will be attracted by the
suggestion that a job awaits them where
work is the main feature. The credulous,
not knowing what the word means, are
sure to be ensnared. — !ago (Vic.).
Compulsory Training
One weakness of the Federal Govern-
ment’s compulsory-training scheme is the
call-up of age-groups—the present plan
is to call up youths of 18.
During the war, in almost every tent
in every A.I.F. unit, there would be a
scatter of ages ranging from 18 to 50.
The influence that many of the older men
had on the youngsters was remarkable,
particularly the influence of those who
were Old Diggers. Sometimes the influ-
ence was bad, but that was so rare that
it had little effect on the unit as a whole.
Sometimes the older men gained a respect
that the n.c.os. couldn’t get from some
of the lads.
Imagine a tent of lads all 18. Where
is the restraining and guiding influence
to come from? It’s no use expecting it
from the n.c.os. or instructors —they are
not in a position to give it. It must come
from among the men, from, themselves
and their mates.
The drafting of groups of’ these lads
to existing C.M.F. units and absorbing
them there would help to solve the prob-
lem. That was done with universal
trainees at the beginning of the last war
with some success.—R. W. (N.S.W.).
Teachers
Teachers as wage - earners (B.
27/12/’5,0)? For many years the salary-
rates of teachers, like those of nurses and
the clergy, were based on the assumption
that noble work brought its own reward.
In the last five years (I’m talking of
N. S. Wales) their salaries,, have been
nearly doubled and their conditions con-
siderably improved, all through the
efforts of the present executive of the
N. S. Wales Teachers’ Federation. Is it
any wonder then that all efforts to shift
them have failed? The teacher’s attitude,
when his pay-cheque jumps appreciably,
is no different from that of any other
wage-earner. His purpose in teaching
might be to educate the young, but his
reason is to earn a living. Anyone who
improves that living for the teacher earns
his gratitude, and that is just what the
N. S. Wales Federation has done.
My quarrel with the T.F. is that it is
lowering the professional standing of
teaching—the point made by The
Bulletin. While the executive did its
job for teachers no one worried what its
politics might be, but, particularly since
the coming of the Menzies Government,
the political side has come right to the
fore. That can only lead to one of two
things—the collapse of the executive or
the complete discrediting of the teaching
profession in public opinion.
A regrettable feature of the present
regime in the N. S. Wales T.F is that it’s
done nothing to improve the professional
standing of teachers. In common with
most trade-unions, nowadays, its object
seems to be to bring all to the level of
the inefficient. The federation claims as
one of its greatest achievements the
abolition of the educational theses as
steps to promotion. There is now no
incentive or encouragement for a teacher
to read educational research reports or
to study modern educational methods.
The federation journal, “Education,”
“Lucky I Wore my rope-soled
sandals !”
rarely contains items of professional
value; most of its space is taken up with
politics that don’t concern teachers as a
body however they may concern them
individually.
The reason for the Red control of the
N, S. Wales T.F. is easy to see. The
Reds work. They do not make a part-
time hobby of the job ; they put all their
energy and ability (both considerable)
into it. When there is, as now, any
movement of dissatisfaction, attention is
distracted by a campaign, usually for
increased salaries —the present one is for
an increase of £2OB a year —and then
branding any critic as a saboteur of the
salaries campaign.
The well-known Communist technique
of clouding the issue is used extensively.
Just as the coalminers in 1949 were asked
to vote on not whether they would strike,
but whether they should retain the right to
strike, so teachers were asked to vote at
the 1950 conference not whether they
opposed the anti-Red bill, but whether
they wished to maintain “civil liberties”
for teachers. That, in some obscure
fashion, was mixed up with the opposi-
tion to the bill. After all, who would
vote to deprive himself Of “civil liberties,”
whatever that phrase may mean?
Teachers are no fools, yet they are
deplorably unaware of the harm being
done to them by their Red-infested
federation in N. S. Wales, If they want
to be regarded as a professional body
they must act professionally, and not be
hoodwinked by a few shillings dangled
in front of them. They must remember,
too, that professional ethics are not
peculiar to the B.M.A. —D. W. (N.S.W.).
Pensioners
“Critic” (B. 3/1/’5l) apparently believes
that owning a house valued at more than
the statutory property limit allowable to
an old-age pensioner will disqualify a
person from drawing the pension. Actu-
ally, the value of a pensioner’s home,
unless income is drawn from it, is excluded
from the property restriction. Further,
in N. S. Wales, councils can, if they so
desire, relieve such properties from payc
ment of rates. — Kanimbla (N.S.W-)-
“National” Theatre
The Prime Minister is supposed to be
favorably disposed towards subsidising a
“national” theatre. Why? In all States,
and, for that matter, in all countries,
actors who can’t make the grade and
playwrights who can’t sell their plays
scream out for a “national” theatre.
Why? So that the public, who do
not wish to see these actors and hear
these plays, will be forced to pay for
them anyway?
Already in some States little amateur
companies are getting money from the
Government to pay for their brief hours
of glory on the stage. Why should they?
If they want to play at being actors,
why shouldn’t they either be compelled
to bring their acting up to the standard
necessary to pack people in or else to
pay for their vanity?
If the public doesn’t want the pro-
ducts of actors, writers and producers of
plays it should not be compelled to buy
them. The call for “national” theatres is
another example of a claim on the
national purse by people who are not
entitled to anything more than they can
raise themselves.—R. H. (Q.).
Bureaucrat’s English
Sir Alan Herbert is still in this land,
I believe. If so, since he probably sees
The Bulletin, it should interest him to
read this specimen of bureaucratic
English from a recent Government order
issued from Whitehall:
In the nuts (unground) (other than
groundnuts) order, the expression “nuts
shall have reference to such nuts, other than
groundnuts, as would, but for this amend-
ing order, not qualify as nuts (unground)
(other than groundnuts) by reason of their
being nuts (unground).
Some New York journalist pounced on it
first. Then a paper in the Middle West
reproduced it with advice to the author
to simplify it by calling them peanuts,—
