TWO BIRD BOOKS
First published in 1932 and reprinted
sixteen times up to 1956, Neville W.
Cayley’s What Bird Is That? has of
course always been invaluable and
indispensable to anyone in Australia,
amateur or professional, who wanted
to know what bird was which. It has
now been republished by Angus and
Robertson in a completely revised
edition which makes it, if possible,
more indispensable than ever.
The old edition had one weakness
of which all amateur bird-watchers
complain: that the color-plates of each
individual bird were too small. It is
a valid complaint, but there is not
likely to be any remedy for it, for no
publisher could make large color-plates
of all those hundreds of birds without
enormous expense and without running
into a set of several enormous volumes,
like some of the more sumptuous
orchid-books, which, in two senses,
would be no use to the average bird-
lover’s pocket.
In practice, the more one gets used
to the book and accustomed to classify-
ing the birds in their various families—
so that one knows, for example, that
it is not much use looking for an emu
in the color-plate of tree-creepers, or
an albatross among the firetail-finches—
the less this difficulty matters; but the
new edition at any rate has done a
good deal to help the amateur, not by
enlarging the plates, but by remaking
the complete set and, to save him
dodging about all over the place trying
to relate plates to letterpress, printing
the appropriate list of birds opposite
each plate.
This reviewer’s favorite color-plate
in the old Cayley has always been
No. XVII, the tree-creepers and sheilas*,
not so much for its use in identification
but for its purely aesthetic appeal.
There is something exceptionally
charming about all these little brown
birds perching about the page on then-
pink and brown branches and bits of
bark; and for some reason, perhaps
just that Cayley was artistically happy
when he was doing it, these birds
look much more alive and less like
museum-specimens than many of the
others—the “Parrots of the Tree-tops,”
for example, in Plate XXII. It cannot
be said that the new edition makes this
plate any more charming. The whites
are whiter, the browns are richer, and
perhaps the total effect is slightly more
dramatic; but the pinks have almost
disappeared in the hot browns and,
lacking this modulating softness, the
plate is slightly less attractive than its
predecessor.
This is, in fact, a minor disadvantage
of several of the new plates; a hotting-
up of the browns which sometimes
gives an effect of harshness. The sea-
birds of Plate XXXVI, who used to
repose on somewhat inconsequential
but pleasing patches of pink, now squat
on most uncompromising yellow-
brown sands; and the whole page does
not look quite so harmonious . . . not
that, being so crowded, it was ever
one of Cayley’s best.
But this disadvantage is offset by a
firmer, richer brown in the plumage of
the birds throughout the book; and
there is no doubt that the general effect
of the new plates is an improvement:
clearer, truer, richer color, therefore
helping in identification and at the
same time, more often than not, making
a more attractive picture. So great is
the improvement in some instances that
it is quite astonishing, in fact, to
compare the magpies and other black-
and-white birds in Plate VIII and to
realise that in the old Cayley there
were no real blacks or whites but only
a dullish approximation to them. If
you compare the gorgeous riflebirds,
bowerbirds and drongoes of Plate II
you will find that the greens have
become greener, the golds more golden;
and the satin bowerbird, if not necess-
arily more attractive, a considerably
more probable shade of blue. Or you
could note how much improved are
the metallic purples and greens in the
wing of the white-headed pigeon in
Plate IH . . .
The text, too, has been revised and
largely rewritten for this edition by a
panel of three experts, A. H. Chisholm,
K. A. Hindwood and A. R. McGill,
aided by the Gould League of Bird
Lovers. Some of the revision, it must
be said, seems unnecessary. In a book
such as this, encyclopaedic in character,
and something of a community effort,
Cayley’s text may not be sacrosanct,
but it seems a pity to alter it except
for very good reason. However, much
of the original text remains, and the
general effect is once again, an
improvement: to correct minor errors
in Cayley; to add the most up-to-date
information; to make the letterpress,
like the color-plates, crisper.
Other improvements are a list of
rare visitors to Australia not recorded
in the former edition—mostly sea-birds,
but also including such unexpected
customers as the Common Swallow
of the Northern Hemisphere which,
migrating southward, was once ob-
served at Cape York, and the Colombo
Crow which “has wandered, per ship,
from Colombo to Fremantle, W.A.,
on a number of occasions”—and a new
color-plate, drawn by Brian Bertram
of the Australian Museum, of birds
introduced to Australia such as the
sparrow, skylark and that elegant eater
of magnolia-buds, the red-whiskered
bulbul.
Angus and Robertson have also re-
published in a revised edition A. H.
Chisholm’s Bird Wonders of Australia:
an appropriate and indeed essential
companion for Cayley, for everybody
who is interested enough to identify
our birds will of course want to know
something of their habits; and, so far
as this reviewer knows, not forgetting
Charles Barrett, Chisholm’s book
performs this service more compre-
hensively and more entertainingly than
anything else in the field.
It is an informal, companionable
sort of book, wandering out into the
bush instead of just staying in the
museum, full of interest on every page
from its discussion of birds and snakes
to its exotic facts about bowerbirds and
lyrebirds and its fresh information on
that most curious habit birds have of
annointing themselves with ants
presumably, Chisholm is inclined to
think, as a tonic. The photographic
illustrations are mostly new in this
edition and some of them are superb.
A Kinky Old Salt
The Search for Captain Slocum, by
Walter Magnes Teller (Deutsch),
reintroduces a very odd character who
dropped into Sydney in 1896 and made
a considerable stir, not only on
account of the cold waters over which
he sailed but also on account of the
unexpectedly hot water he found in
the Harbor.
Slocum was the old sea-captain who,
setting out from Boston in 1895, sailed
alone round the world in the Spray
and wrote a celebrated book about it.
When he first hit Newcastle, N.S.W.,
somebody hit him with a lead-line,
which is supposed to account for some
of his subsequent eccentricities; but
worse than a lead-line was to hit him
in Sydney, and it seems clear that his
eccentricities began long before his
accident.
The Sydney thunderbolt was one
Henry A. Slater, who had formerly
been second-officer on the Northern
Light under Slocum’s command. He
had been an ex-convict when Slocum
engaged him, says Teller, and was now,
surprisingly enough, an ex-constable,
having “served the colony in the
Darlinghurst police.”
When he heard that Slocum had
arrived in the Spray, Slater called a
public meeting and proceeded to tell
how, on the Northern Light, after they
had disagreed about bullying the men
and also about some job on the mizzen-
mast, his captain came at him with a

SPLIT TO THE WIDE
IMrORE and more each day the Aus-
tralian Labor Party must regret
that it ever opened its mouth about
Parliamentary salaries.
If any principle had been involved
the issue would have been fought-out
long ago. But there was no principle.
When the last Richardson report
recommending increases in salaries was
presented in May, 1956, only one
Labor man spoke on it—Dr. Evatt,
who spoke for the whole party, and
the only Labor interjector cheered
him on.
Dr. Evatt on that occasion put a
strong case for abiding by the report
of the Richardson Committee, which
contained two of the three members
who again considered the matter
recently. Every argument he used
about their capacity and judgment in
doing the fair thing was no less valid
in 1959 than in 1956. He extolled Sir
Frank Richardson as one who had
“occupied very important positions,
has a great knowledge of commerce
and industry and Government....
specially qualified as chairman.” He
dwelt on the fact that he had “assisting
him Mr. G. E. Fitzgerald, the general
president of the Australian Society of
Accountants, who is a university-
lecturer in accountancy,” and who was
“familiar with the salaries and emolu-
ments of those engaged in industry
and public service of various kinds.”
Dr. Evatt said that the committee’s
views “could not be disputed by any
patriotic Australian.” And all his
fellow-Labor members sat beaming.
The only two private members who
spoke either for or against the second
reading of the bill were Falkinder
(Lib.), of Tasmania, and Turnbull
(Country party), who were subjected
to one or two rather jeering interjec-
tions from the Labor benches because
of their opposition to the bill.
TT is safe to say that except for some
A internal influences the course events
might have been exactly the same this
year. The original opposition to the
bill from the Labor benches was
apparently intended to be no more
than a move to put all the blame on
the Government while sharing in the
booty. But the matter became more
complicated as elements within the
party sections, both in the caucus and
outside, saw. the opportunities offering
for betrayal of leaders who have
become stale news in order to super-
sede them.
To E. J. Ward, leadership of the
party is worth more than a rise in
private-member salary at the present
time. And to various factions the
matter presented a means to be used
at the forthcoming Federal conference
to destroy enemies and fulfil political
ambitions of their own.
Unfortunately the pot of dissension
seems to have boiled-over. The leaders
who set the example by yelling have
set everybody else screaming in com-
petition and fighting to make the issue
his own. with the result that the party
now resembles a mob of women at a
bargain-sale all trying to capture the
same pair of four-and-elevenpenny
red-nylon panties.
Some of the elements concerned in
the fracas, like the Victorian State
executive, do not seem to be able to
move hand or foot except as indicated
by Communist policy. The Victorians
even presumed to suggest that members
should be ordered to hand over the
proceeds of their rises to the A.L.P.
organisation under pain of loss of
nomination, but more moderate and
experienced leaders realise how gross
a contempt of Parliament such a step
might be and the nature of its possible
consequences.
'T'HE Government, which had been
the main target in the beginning,
has ceased to be the Labor target. The
issue has ceased to be whether M.P.s
shall get rises. It has now become a
matter of discipline as to whether
A.L.P. rules shall be obeyed, particu-
larly the basic rule, which is the very
heart of Labor’s ability to exist and
function in Parliament that a
minority shall accept the decision of
the majority, and vote in the House
accordingly.
This rule was not obeyed by Ward,
Haylen, Cairns and others who sought
to evade the consequences of their
actions by not voting at all. The presi-
dent of the Federal A.L.P.. who has
always been the stern arch-advocate
of the good old Moscow principle that
whoever breaks this rule must be
expelled, has resigned to back the
rebels; and the leader who has lived by
the support of the Leftist rebels is com-
bining with his Rightist enemies to des-
troy them as deviationists. Altogether
it is about as pretty a mess as any party
in Australia has ever found itself in, the
whole floundering and panting for the
meeting of the Federal and State
Assemblies so that they may wield their
pretexts to destroy their enemies.
TN the background, of course, stand
± the great Communist unions whose
leaders are linking the issue to the fight
against the penal clauses of the Arbi-
tration Act (“fines for workers, pay-
grab for M.P.s”) in the hope that it
will break-up the Labor party and leave
them in control of a helot Federal
organisation.
They, of course, are all in favor
of palaces, champagne, country-houses
and bullet-proof limousines for the
Commissars of Moscow, but in Aus-
tralia they believe that M.P.s and
Ministers should wait for these luxuries
till they themselves are in power. The
Communist official organ in Sydney
rejoices that “the Communist party is
the only political party to oppose the
Richardson report on principle.”
The Trades and Labor Councils
have competed with each other in
objurgation, but it is regrettable that
the country has been deprived of the
sage viewpoint of Albert Monk, presi-
dent of the A.C.T.U., who has been
otherwise occupied in Russia.
Most of those involved in the battle
have so far transgressed Labor rules
or committed themselves to condem-
nation of their leaders that they cannot
turn back. Mr. Haylen has committed
the unforgiveable sin of accusing Dr.
Evatt of not having given “effective
leadership.” He and others, who sup-
posedly support Mr. Chamberlain’s
horror at what has taken place, do not
agree with his line of action. Mr.
Haylen, while not prepared to bow to
Parliamentary leadership, is ready to
be the slave of an outside dictator who
has no responsibility to the electors. He
believes that the A.L.P.’s retiring head
commissar should have given the
caucus a “firm and stern directive in
his capacity of Federal president,” and
that “the Federal Executive should
have given us lines on which we could
have moved earlier, and then we might
not have had this conflict.”
This is one of the most significant
utterances of the whole shindy and
shows why Parliamentary Labor has
become what it is. Haylen and
most other members consider them-
selves, though elected by a majority of
electors, to be puppets of the A.L.P.
The fight is not now about salaries,
but about whether the Parliamentary
members will or will not take the
orders of the A.L.P. juntas. In course
of it Labor is being torn to pieces, with
no part of it being strengthened save
the Communist underground financed
by the Watersiders, Seamen and other
unions which draw their inspiration
from Moscow.


STRAWB'S LAST STAND


PLAIN ENGLISH
Khrushchev's Apotheosis
On the verge of the Foreign Ministers’
Conference and of the decisive period
in the settlement of the Berlin issue—
or the unsettlement of it —the most
peculiar atmosphere of fog envelops the
Kremlin.
Mikoyan, since his return from the
United States, seems to have completely
effaced himself. Scarcely a word has
been heard of his doings in the last two
months. Khrushchev, having gone
through the satellite countries of East
Germany and Poland in a strange con-
tradictory series of moods which im-
pelled-him one day to look and sound
like a comic imitation of Hitler and the
next like the good fairy out of Hans
Andersen, retired to the Crimea after a
final burst of abusive fireworks.
He was scarcely out of the way when
the Kremlin apparently decided to cele-
brate his birthday by abolishing collective
leadership and restoring the “personality
cult,” which Khrushchev himself was
supposed to have demolished, along with
Stalin’s reputation, at the 20th Congress
of the Russian Communist Party.
Possibly his colleagues did this in self-
defence after having observed the attri-
tion which seems to be a feature of
collective-rulership. Malenkov, Molotov,
Bulganin, Zhukov and a dozen other
figures have fallen victims to the germs
of deviationism or treason which have
carried them off politically, and it is
feared in some cases physically, since
they were elevated to a share in the glory
of running the U.S.S.R.
Khrushchev’s record in his period of
office has been rather like that of a
Roman Emperor of the mad era. His
views and behavior have never been the
same for two days together. One day
he has been discovered drunk and dis-
orderly shouting such abuse at foreign
Ambassadors as has not normally been
levelled at Ambassadors since the Middle
Ages. Another day he has been a very
dove of peace, patting everybody on the
back and pausing only in his displays of
loving-kindness towards Westerners to
lecture his fellow-citizens on the evils
of drunkenness.
In the era in which Russian borders
have been opened more freely than at any
time since the October revolution, he has
nevertheless done more swashbuckling
and threatened more people with more
horrible fates than any other dictator
since the Czars. Against the background
of his yearnings to prove himself more
civilised than his predecessors stand the
bloody incidents of Hungary and Tibet.
On his birthday he was elevated by
the Soviet press to the same heights as
Stalin, extolled as “our beloved tutor,”
“the source of our glory,” and various
other extravagances which place him
among the Russian gods.
A few days afterwards circumstantial
reports suggested that he was gravely ill
with a brain-tumor or. with hardening of
the cerebral arteries, which seems not
unlikely judging by his brainstorms and
his erratic behavior.
So far as anybody knows he is still in
the Crimea, but a belated official report
has been issued about him which says
that he will be present" at the ceremonies
of May 1 in Moscow.
Anything that comes out of Moscow
is only true when proved true.
Not all his former admirers outside
Russia joined in adulation of Khrush-
chev’s virtues on his natal day. Nasser’s
birthday-present took the shape of a
hearty smack in the eye consisting of an
allegation that there was a Communist
plot in the Middle East to use Israel and
Iraq as the claws of a pincer which would
presently enfold the “fertile crescent of
Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq,” as a
preliminary to setting-up a Communist
Government in Egypt and starting a
sweep across Africa, with plans to
dominate South America as well.
Nasser is even asking Britain and
France to buy the cotton which he has
been selling to Czechoslovakia. It is
evident that the Arab bloc has given
Khrushchev away, along with Iraq, the
Government of which Nasser cannot see
“any hope” of coming to terms with.
Non-Asian Influenza
[From Canberra]
Finis, at least on the Parliamentary level,
has been written to the sorry Saga of
the Salaries, with the passage through
the august Senate of the last of the legis-
lation implementing the main recom-
mendations of the Richardson Report
last week.
Members and Senators from both sides
of the Parliament left Canberra at the
weekend, many with wrinkled reputa-
tions, many with misgivings, many with
consciences—but all with an extra £l3 a
week, retrospective to March 1 last.
In a remarkable finale to the whole
sorry mess, a particularly virulent strain
of influenza —now known as Salaries
Sickness —struck at the Parliament.
Strangely, it affected only Labor mem-
bers of the Senate—l 3 of them in all,
preventing any possibility of the legisla-
tion being defeated.
When the final figures were counted,
Labor could muster only 13 of its full
complement of 26, in contrast with excel-
lent Government Whipping by Dame
Annabelle Rankin, of Queensland, who
ensured that there was a full turn-out of
31 Government Senators, even though
rebel Tasmanian Reg Wright defected.
The sting had gone right out of the
Opposition.
They were so shaken by the events of
the past three weeks that at the weekly
caucus-meeting last Wednesday nobody
dared raise the issue of defecting votes,
incompetent leadership and the numer-
ous other charges that had been bandied
about.
One veteran Labor menjber, comment-
ing later on the absence of any reference
to the matter 'at caucus, said: “No one
was prepared to light the bushfire. They
had no idea of how to put it out.”
The salaries uproar, however, while
it may be dead, is not yet buried, as
there will be a long post-mortem on the
corpse at the A.L.P. Federal executive in
Canberra on May 5, and further autopsies
at the A.L.P. conference the following
week.
No one is awaiting the outcome more
anxiously than Parliamentary Opposition-
leader Evatt.
Accent on Youth
[From Canberra]
Officials organising the tour later this
year of H.R.H. Princess Alexandra have
made a wise decision. With the approval
of the Princess, they have put the “accent
on youth” in her tour-programme.
Details released at the weekend show
that official functions, as known from
previous Royal tours, have been cut to
a minimum and as many opportunities as
possible are being given to Alexandra to
meet the youth of Australia.-
The only real chance Federal
politicians and their wives will get to
bore the Princess will be at a ball to be
held at Parliament Flouse. For the rest
of her stay at Canberra arrangements
have been made for her to meet as
representative a cross-section of the
young people of the city as possible.
Highlight of this will be a dance.at
Government House, which will be a
much more informal affair than the State
ball being arranged by/for the politicians.
She will tour the vast Snowy Moun-
tains scheme for two days before return-
ing to England late in September.
Garter Knight
All Australia will be pleased at the
appointment of Governor-General Slim
to a Knighthood of the Garter, prob-
ably the highest honor the Crown has to
offer.
Sir William Slim joins the select band
of great war-leaders in the Order —Earl
Mountbatten, Viscount Alanbrooke,
Viscount Portal and Viscount Mont-
gomery.
In Australia the Governor-General has
received a popular accolade from
everybody with whom he has come into
contact. His strong personality, his
ability and keen observation have the
accompaniment of a broadminded out-
spokenness ; and while maintain-
ing the dignity which goes with a
Royal representative’s office, he has
exhibited a warm friendliness and interest
in the Australian way of life. With all
classes, from Prime Ministers to stock-
men in the outback —and sporting men
on the inside —he has been at home. In
their more worthy achievements he finds
Australians extremely modest.
Field-Marshal Slim is easily the most
versatile Governor-General Australia has
had: a great, soldier who rose from the
ranks —like many Australian generals, he
began life as a schoolmaster —a splendid


speaker, and a writer of English prose and
exponent of military history who is well
up in the ranks of modern writers.
Australians have found him a warm,
if sometimes candid, friend, and will be
sorry to see his term end this year and
will hope that his successor will be half
as good. If he is, there will continue to
be no quarrel even from extremists
with the present policy of appointing
Governors-General from overseas.
Peace at a Price
Not for many years in a Victorian Par-
liament has there been such a continued
show of strength by backbenchers as in
recent weeks.
Before Christmas the Cabinet decided
to legislate for the extension of trading-
hours for new- and used-car dealers, and
provision was made for this by lengthen-
ing them to 8 a.m.-lO p.m. from Mon-
days to Saturdays, instead of the pre-
vailing 6 p.m.-closing from Mondays to
Thursdays. The backbenchers objected,
and the provision has been dropped from
the bill.
Last year the Government amended
the regulations governing Albert Park,
an inner park and lake area, to prevent
motor-car races without the Govern-
ment’s permission, and Bolte added, for
good measure, that his Government
would never give permission. Yet A.L.P.
Senator Kennelly, the protagonist of the
races, has been so successful in mould-
ing the Liberal backbenchers, through
municipal and charity mediators, that
there is now every chance of the party
reviewing the Act.
Cabinet also has backed-down 8 on its
bread bill, cad in the legislation now
offered to Parliament the clauses setting-
up a bread-industry committee of nine
members to regulate the industry and
to allow one-man bakers to bake in
unrestricted hours, except Sundays, have
been dropped. The Minister for Labor
announced, rather bravely, that the im-
portant provisions on bread standard
should not be delayed by other contro-
versial questions.
Bolte’s placatory attitude cannot be
dissociated from a not unnatural desire
to leave his deputy, Rylah, with a happy
party as he goes on his world tour.
Tasmanian Election
After a very short but not exactly sweet
campaign, Tasmania will hold a general
election on Saturday,-when a record 89
candidates will contest the 35 Assembly
seats. For 50 years there were 30 mem-
bers in the House, each of the five
Federal divisions returning six members,
chosen under the Hare-Clark system of
proportional-representation. Last year, in
an attempt to end the condition of near-
deadlock that has existed for several years,
the electoral laws were amended to pro-
vide seven members to each electorate.
This change had been advocated for a
long time, but its first tryout is in
circumstances not envisaged when it was
originally suggested.
The expectation was that seven-mem-
ber electorates would in all probability
give either the Labor or the Liberal
party a clear majority, instead of the
15-15 House of recent years. This could
happen on Saturday, but it is also quite
on the cards that one or more D.L.P.
members could hold the balance of
power. Another possibility, even more
embarrassing to the main parties, is that
former Treasurer Turnbull, who is
running as an Independent, may squeeze
in between their evenly-divided ranks.
Labor, having only recently expelled
Turnbull from the Cabinet —it was this
that precipitated the election could
hardly accept office relying on his sup-
port. On the other hand it is less than
a year since the Liberals were demand-
ing his resignation and moving a no-
confidence motion against him.
At the Federal election last November
the A.L.P. vote was slightly ahead of
the Liberal in both the Senate and the
House of Representatives. Labor won
three seats and the Libs, two in the
Reps. In the Senate each party won two
seats and the D.L.P. took the fifth. The
D.L.P. collected almost 17 per cent, of
the Senate votes. That figure would be
easily enough to elect a member on
Saturday, but none of the D.L.P. candi-
dates has the prestige and personal popu-
larity Senator Cole was able to command.
Bolte Gets the Money
[F rom “Collins-street”]
There was no doubt where Billy Hughes
stood in 1947 about the bill to increase
the pay for Federal M.P.s. He was out
to get the money and he didn’t care who
knew. The closest performance to that
personality since (whether in Canberra
or Spring Street) has been given by Henry
Bolte.
Billy Hughes threatened what he re-
garded as the weak-kneed among the
members that, if history was to be
trusted, those who voted against the
increases Would not be returned by
grateful taxpayers at the next election
at the top of the polls but thrown-out.
Bolte didn’t issue any threats ; but he
wanted the money, and he wanted it
very quickly, because within a day or
two he was to go abroad.
The political atmosphere was very
much against Bolte, but not entirely.
Although there was a real public resent-
ment of the handsome way in which the
Federal M.P.s were treating themselves,
it was less marked in the reaction to the
Martin recommendations in Victoria, due
substantially to its treatment by the Mel-
bourne press.
The dailies in Melbourne had not
carried their criticism of the Canberra
pay-rises to the bitter hostility shown by
the “Sydney Morning Herald” group
(acknowledged and crypto); and press
and Parliament jog along comfortably
enough as they do in the other capitals,
other than Canberra and Sydney. So
Bolte’s belated efforts were presented as
musical comedy rather than as a melo-
drama of The Pinched Pensioner.
When the Labor Opposition let him
down by docilely adopting a direction
from the A.L.P. to vote against the rises,
his scorn in the House was heavy (as
Labor attempted not too hard —to
delay passage of the bill) about those who
took their orders from the Trades Hall ;
but there was always the Country party,
although the annual conference had
directed members to vote against a pay-
rise bill.
,Yet it took at least three meetings—
there may have been others even more
secret where Government members were
not waiting agonisingly outside the door
for the result —lobbying equal to that en-
countered only when it is proposed to
raise the standards of milk or bread and
adroit House tactics before Bolte was
able to depart at the weekend satisfied
he had done his share to ensure he would
not return to a House of broken col-
leagues on the breadline.
Victorian Electorates
Seven-hundred delegates turned up at
the annual conference of the Victorian
Country party at Bendigo, and many of
them must have been bewildered to dis-
cover that apparently the most important
business was to instigate a campaign for
a redivision of Assembly seats, by the
divorcing of them from the Federal seats,
to give “a true 23 country seats.”
This was apparently a counter to what
is expected to happen in the Council.
The mischievous attitude of the
Country party in the Legislative Council
in shredding, with its one-vote majority
when voting with Labor, sound legisla-
tion passed by the Liberals in the
Assembly, last year produced mysterious
hints in the press about the Government
considering an overhaul of Council
electorates.
These threats obviously originated from
State Cabinet. When questioned at the
time in the Legislative Council, the
Government Leader, Sir Arthur Warner,
pleaded innocently that he knew nothing
of them, but they were more than threats.
A survey was actually being made,
although one was hardly necessary, since
one country province, North Western, has
47,000 voters, and one city province,
Southern, 160,000. The disparity of votes
is three-to-one in other city and country
provinces.
It is now accepted as certain in Spring
Street that Bolte will legislate for a more
equitable redistribution of the votes of
the provinces before the next Council
election in 1961. This inevitably will
reduce C.P. representation, but it could
hardly be claimed the stinging recoil had
not been earned. It will be necessary for
Bolte to get Labor support in the Council
for the redivision bill, but no doubt this
will be given with alacrity.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
"THE BREAKER" AND TRITTON
[From Rev. VV. J. Owens]
As I think that “Duke” Tritton is
(among other things) a bit of a sport
and not unwilling to stand up to a knock
or two, may 1 take him up on a few
points?
(1) “The traditional style of English
riding.” Does he mean the Australian
tradition of comic riding by an English-
man, or the established style of riding
in England? “Cock,” his English cobber,
admittedly could not ride when he left
England and acquired his knowledge of
equitation from “Duke” and his mates.
Did they, and do they, ride in the
“traditional English style”? Did it not
occur to “Duke” that “Cock's backside
flopping up and down” was largely
occasioned by his stirrups being too
short?
(2) Does not “Duke” know that Harry
Morant [“The Breaker”] — an accom-
plished horseman according to Australian
standards—was born in England and his
style of riding acquired there? In 1902,
under instructions from the English War
Office, I went to Fordingbridge in Hamp-
shire to assist in handing-over his effects
that had just arrived from South Africa.
(3) “Duke's” information about the
British Army is very much astray. The
white cross-belts went out over a hundred
years ago, and were .replaced by the buff
“belt and braces” of the Slade-Wallace
equipment. The scarlet tunic and white
helmet of the First Boer War and the
Gordon Relief Expedition in the .’Bo’s
were replaced for foreign service by an
all-over khaki, and certainly were never
seen by Australians in the Second Boer
"We must not be hasty in our judgment , my sweet. After all it IS a
pleasure-cruise!"
War or the two World Wars. Webbing,
or leather, bandoliers were worn by
mounted troops —obviously over the left
shoulder, and not over the right, as indi-
cated by ‘"Duke.”
Obviously Tritton, as an Australian,
city-born and -bred, could • have little
knowledge of English life in rural parts
or in her Army, and only a late and
limited experience of horses. His errors,
therefore, in these departments are
excusable and more amusing than irritat-
ing, but it comes to a different matter
when he .repeats unfounded gossip of
“the murder of Harry Morant” and
repeats the shocking gossip that Aus-
tralian troops were paraded under duress
to witness the execution and deprived
of their rifles to prevent them firing on
the countrymen (be it noted) of their
comrade.
As an Englishman, I protest against the
portrayal of a comic Englishman, alike
deficient in horsemanship, common-
sense and justice.
I might tell “Duke” Tritton that I
lived nearly 30 years in England—fifteen
of which were spent in the Territorial
Army, seven in the infantry and four in
the cavalry. Fifty years in Australia —
half of them in the country —and an
Australian son and daughter (as my son
tells me) still leave me a “Pommy,” but
1 hope have not impaired my love for a
fair deal.

“C.F.”: . Going to Russia from Aus-
tralia (B. 1/4/’59) has always been some-
thing of a crusade. I remember travel-
ling to England in 1929 on a Bay-boat.
We had two tourists bound for Russia
aboard ; they were being sent by some
union, but they were very haughty. They
got around in their shirt-sleeves and navy-
serge pants, and kept so aloof that my
remembered impression of them is of
their slightly-rounded white-cotton backs.
They just didn’t mix with any of the
people aboard, not even with one of the
younger Lindsays who had a new copy
of Byron, or with Myra Morris, who had
some very pretty frocks, particularly a
blue with a gathered skirt,

“K.R.H.”: I’ve noticed several pars.

about an absentminded bishop, Dr.
Wentworth-Shields. Over the years I’ve
heard them many times, but here is a
true one . j was a cho ir-boy at New-
castle Cathedral when it happened. As
the eve ning service was about to begin
the bishop said to Dean Archdall, “I’ve
forgotten the notes of my sermon. Don’t
worry - i know where j i e f t them,’’ and
be re t urned to the deanery. The service
proceeded and as sermon-time came near
without the bishop's reappearance the
dean sent a curate to look for him. He
found the bishop about to get into bed.
When the curate* explained that he was
to deliver the sermon the bishop said,
“Dear me, you know I thought I had
delivered it.”
DOUBLE TROUBLE
“A group of women met in Sydney to form
a political party with the object of having every
State and Federal electorate represented- by
both a man and a woman.”
A group of Sydney women has been
meeting to invent
A Good Housekeeping method of con-
ducting government;
The thought that most excites them is
that each constituency
Should elect a man and woman, instead
of one M.P.
They've probably decided that the mem-
ber of today
Will need a Parliamentary wife to help
him spend his pay,
Though budgeting the member’s pay,
with alt the dust it rouses,
Is not the best-housekeeping way of
running certain Houses.
It didn’t work in Eden with the local
Sir and Madam ;
A lobbyist corrupted Eve, and she cor-
rupted Adam :
An Angel with a flaming sword was very
much upset;
He sent them to the country —and they
haven’t got back yet! -
There’s much with which good house-
keepers in politics can grapple,
But attempts to feed two people on one
Parliamentary apple
Don’t argue them as clever as they would
be, / am sure,
If they’d rest themselves contented with
the diplomatic core.

/''J. loves in old novels (B. 15/4/’59)
” did not figure only as grubby
on poor relations ; heroines drew -on
gloves in moments of hauteur, buttoned
or unbuttoned them to gain time, stripped
them off as a gesture of abandon, dropped
them as man-bait, flung them down in
despair; the “small, gloved hand” in
his engendered the hero’s first pangs of
passion, and a single glove (invariably
delicately perfumed) was a trophy over
which he yearned. Jane Eyre, fleeing
from worse than death, remembered her
gloves ; Captain Wragge perpetuated all
his. villainies in black cotton gloves
(“neatly darned at the finger-tips”); Mr.
Swiveller dashingly sported yellow ones,
while Mr. Bob Sawyer’s appearance is
summed up thus: “He eschewed gloves,
and looked something like a dissipated
Robinson Crusoe.” —“Roomy.”

“Don't Park West” one: “Gent’s W.C.

didn’t investigate, but it did occur to me
that the Blackheath brains-trust should
be able to devise a sign which would
sever the connection between their sani-

“E.H.M.”; Wonder how many remem-
ber the origin of the call-signs of some
of the radio-stations not mentioned by
“Maitri” (B. 8/4/’59)? 3DB originally
stood for Druleigh Business College, over
Melbourne’s Capitol Theatre (this station
was later bought by the “Herald”);
3AW, a combination of music and
theatre, Allan’s and Williamson’s, while
3AR represented Associated Broadcast-
ing. The LO of 3LO, if my memory
holds good, stood for Lloyd Osborne,
who was connected with one of Mel-
bourne’s rag-shops or with Allan’s music-
store. Strange how most of them have
gravitated since then to the news-barons.
—or is it?
“D.8.K.”: Was “Maitri” correct about
2GB’s call-sign origin? In my 35 years
in the Australian radio industry, I have
always understood that the letters in that
call-sign are the initials of the radio-
engineer who started that station on its
way, Gordon Beard, in the early ’twenties.

“Doric”: Was playing the radiogram

ground to his TV election-speeches.

“Siosal”: Since Stanley Kramer was
filming “On the Beach,” it was lair
enough that he should regard himself as
being “on,” rather than “in,” the streets

the Yanks have no monopoly in the
matter of being “on” a particular spot,
A century and more ago a large slice
of Australia’s population was “on”—
never “in” and rarely “at”—the various
goldfields. Some of the old-timers of the
’fifties were still afloat when I was a
small boy in country Victoria, and when
one in particular showed -up we lads
used to nudge each other and say “That's

we weren't quite clear what happened
at Eureka, we knew very well that Bob

fragrancy of the green - belt through

thereby have solved a riddle that’s
puzzled me for 50 years. Half-a-century
ago my girl gave me the bird abruptly
and without any reason at all after a
pleasant Sunday-afternoon drive in my
ultra-smart piano-box buggy with “blood”
pony. We voyaged along Botany Road,
through Red fern, Waterloo and the vast
sandy stretch to somewhere near the
entrance to Shea’s Creek. I pointed-out
to Mary, who was from Orange, the


Cauliflower Inn, the Chinese furniture-
factories, in Botany Road, the expanse of
Chinese market - gardens, O’Riordan’s
soap-factory, the boiling-down works,
knackers’ yards, and wool-scouring estab-
lishments en route, and so on towards
the aboriginal settlement at La Perouse.
Now it’s hit me hard: Mary could have
made an awful mistake and blamed me!

“Corpus”: A padre from a nearby
town made a Sunday visit to a small
country church in S.A. to baptise a num-
ber of infants who had been saved-up
for this occasion. All went well until
the time of the sermon, when the infants
set each other going like cicadas. The
padre was forced to give up the unequal
struggle, and announced the last hymn,
which, believe it or not, had been chosen
by the organist before the service: “Jesus
calls us o'er the tumult.”
/'Yur local newspaper carried a Housing
_ Commission of N.S.W. notice
inviting applications “from married
couples without children who are in-
terested in obtaining the tenancy of Com-

“without children” in any advertisement
of accommodation he would be lucky
to get off with a fine ; for one hears
regularly of the penalties imposed on
people who have inserted advertisements
with such conditions. —“Aginit.”

“Wusslean”: Even when a woman
professes to be completely candid about
her age (B. 8/4/’59), I’d take her word
with a spoonful of salt. The other
evening Mrs. Wusslean, looking ex-
tremely pleased with herself, remarked:
“Today Mrs. Elderly from next-door
said to me ‘Of course, you wouldn’t
remember the first World War —you’re
not forty yet!* I don’t mind her know-
“Any dry-cleaning?”
ing my age, so I told her straight-out,
and she'd hardly believe it, she said.”
When I observed that Mrs. Elderly must
have been surprised to hear she was born
before that particular war began, Mrs.
Wusslean—to her credit, she blushed —
replied: “Oh, I didn’t let on I was that
old. I had to lop-off a few years!”

did the lady maintain a bold front or
make a clean breast of it?

“Musheen”: ffolitts, ffcildins, ffolkts
and ffrench (B. 8 /4/’59), yes ; but never
fforbes. Forbes is the name of a Scottish
Highland clan, and should be pronounced
with two syllables. Traditions regarding
the origin of the name are various ; one
is traced to one Uchonchar from Ireland,
who slew a ferocious bear and, having
received for his reward the hand of a
young and beautiful heiress named Bess,
assumed the name for having killed the
bear “For Bess.”

“Sunray”: She was plentiful; her

“Bardon”: Reference (B. 8/4/’59) to
the Eltham (N.Z.) Jubilee and its old-
time theatrical reviews (“The performers

who walked into a village shop and said
to the. shopkeeper “I want to buy your
complete stock of tomatoes, eggs and
overripe fruit.” “Ah,” said the shop-
keeper, “you must be going to see that
old ham play Julius Caesar at the Village
Hall tonight.” “I,” said the customer,
“am the old ham.”

“Jesmondene”: The nattering
chauffeuses (B. 8/4/’59) who were inter-
rupted by the mobike’s backfiring can
be certain it was intentional. “Bo” in
his youth apparently did no delinquent
mileage on trusty Triumphs or Powerplus
Sevens or he would know that on them
the rider at will produces backfires by
using the exhaust-valve-lifts while the
throttle is well open. Practised im-
moderately for scaring-off charging dogs
or horn-indifferent cows, it often ex-
ploded the back off the pong-box, and
then you could kid yourself you sounded
like Jack Gunn in 1915 bettering 100

J. K. MOIR
MAN OF THE FRIENDLY PEN
By DOROTHY CURTIS-HARE
IT all happened because no
one could tell me who
wrote “The Road to
Gundagai.” I asked every-
one who chanced along until,
one day, a very dignified
gentleman said, “Why don’t
you ask the Head Cheese of
the Bread and Cheese Club?”
As a foreigner from Canada
who didn’t know about bunyips
or bindies, the Australian
sense of humor had often
found an easy mark. This had
all the quality of a “bunyip-
nest.” But the gentleman,
bland and intent, had no
twinkle in his eye.
“Who is the Head Cheese?”
I asked.
“J. K. Moir, the best-
informed Australian on Aus-
traliana you could possibly
meet.”
I telephoned J.K.
Speaking to a stranger on
the telephone is like com-
municating with someone in
a dark tunnel. You miss the
lighting of interest in the eyes,
the humor of the mouth and
the whole absorption of the
person. It was not like that
with J. K. Moir. His voice was
gentle and friendly, with a
brisk businesslike tone that
encouraged me to state my
wishes clearly and concisely.
In five minutes we were
gabbling away happily and
looking forward to a real
visit.
TTnfortunately that was not
to be. My only personal
contact with Australia’s
warmest advocate and guardian
of her literary prestige was by
letter and three phone-calls.
But though I left Melbourne
suddenly, J. K.’s thoughts and
helpfulness went before me
across the thousands of miles
to Perth. This is from a
letter from him, written on
16/5/’5B, which waited for me
in Sydney:
“I am so disappointed that
I missed you, as I feel, after
reading your letter, that I
could have helped "you a lot.
Here are a few people who
might help you—use my name.
“Mr. Daniel O’Brien, sec.
Royal Geog. Soc., Ann St.,
Brisbane; and Doug Lock-
wood, Darwin Melb.

man).
“Alice Springs: Best town in

spots, interesting places. The
keeper of the jail is known to

“Between The Alice and
Port Augusta there is little of
interest except Coober Pedy,
Ayers Rock. This latter is an
awe-inspiring sight. Tell Bill
Harney, if you divert to The
Rock, that I sent you. Bill,
himself, is worth meeting. If
after leaving Port Augusta you
go back through Pentwortham,
Auburn, try to have a look
at the inside of Pentwortham
MOIR
Church and see the Marriage
Register. Bully Hayes, the
‘Scourge of the Pacific,’ was
married there on 25/8/1857.
It was one of several bigamous
marriages he contracted. His
bride was a widow of loose
morals. Pentwortham was
founded by Harrocks, the
explorer. It is about 80 miles
from Adelaide. A few miles
further toward Adelaide is
Auburn, the birthplace of C. J.
Dennis, the poet. The pub in
which he was born still stands.
See Mrs. Jean Glover there.
“Adelaide: Contact lan
Mudie, poet, an authority on
S.A., N.T.; good fellow. His
add. is 54 Moseley Street,
Glenelg. He is a prominent
member of the Fellowship of
Australian Writers. He will
‘wise you up’ to S. Aust.
affairs.
“Perth: Contact J. K. Ewers
(who knows the North). He is
an F.A.W. member. He is poet,
novelist, historian. He will
put you in touch with Mary
Durack (Mrs. Miller) and
Henrietta Drake-Brockman and
others.
“Of course I’ll be delighted
to read your MS. [on one of
Mrs. Curtis-Hare’s books on
her experiences in Australia].
I do wish I’d seen you. Feel
I could have helped you more
if I knew exactly what you
intend doing.
“Have not been well for
some time. Had an X-ray last
week —nothing wrong. The

conclusion that I am exhausted,
insist that I have a rest. To-
morrow I go out to Dr.
Heath’s for a fortnight.
“Write to me en route, let
me know if I can help in any
way.”
Tn Brisbane it took a bit of
■*- sleuthing to find Mr. Daniel
O'Brien. The building was
large, honeycombed with shops,
offices and passages. As I
followed the arrow marked
“Royal Geographical Society,”
people scurried around me like
rabbits. In and out, upstairs
and round corners, until a door
opened into the Inner Sanctum.
Here Mr. O’Brien’s business
and personal life is so intric-
ately entwined that to separate
them would require a Solomon.
He lives his work in such a
glow of vitality that his snow-
white hair seems alight.
But it was a bit startling to
find him in full dress at 10-
o’clock of a Monday morning.
On his left hand squatted a
huge opal ring that caught the
fire 1 from his eyes as he said,
“I’m sitting for my portrait,
and I’ve just been telling Mr.
Elliot that I don’t mind what
he does to me as long as he
does justice to this opal.” Then
his vivid eyes focused on me:
“Now what is it I can do for
you? I have three minutes to
spare. If you’d come tomorrow
or last week, I had time on
my hands to burn, but to-
day . .
He caught-up the name
J. K. Moir, and away he went:!
“Tell me about J.K.! How
is he? I’m afraid he’s a much
sicker man than he knows. Has
he had a report from the
X-rays? I’ve been impatient!
with J.K. He never spares him-
self, and somebody has to
fight for him. He’s spent his
time helping every Tom, Dick
and Harry to fame, and
neglected his own chances. He
should have had the 0.8. E.
years ago, and he wouldn’t
have it now if we hadn’t fought
for him. Oh, many’s the time
I’ve told him how foolish he
is.”
Dan O’Brien’s eyes flashed
and softened with affection. He
made me see J. K. Moir as a
naughty little boy who needed
a firm parental hand . . .
And J.K. was right about
Doug Lockwood the
busiest journalist, with one of
the largest territories in the
world, was too fast for me. I
was sorry to miss him. His name
popped into every conversa-
tion from Mt. Isa to Darwin,

POLITICAL POINTS
The 39th N.S.W. Parliament was
opened last Tuesday. New members
were sworn-in, the new Speaker, Ray
Maher, was dragged “reluctantly” to the
chair, a few kind words and a few angry
ones were exchanged and the House was
adjourned until May 19. On that date
the intention is to sit for about two hours,
the sole business being to fill a vacancy
in the Legislative Council. Parliament
will not meet for ordinary business until
August.
As the old Parliament went into recess
on December 10, this means that the
House will have gone nine months with-
out a single debating day. Cahill’s not
being fair to members. At this rate how
on earth can they cross their heart and
claim that theirs is a full-time job?

N.S.W. Liberal leader Morton sur-
vived a leadership challenge by E. D.
Darby (who is critical of Morton’s
private business interests) last week by
22 votes to six. Deputy-leader Askin was
also re-elected, with 20 votes to H.
Jackson’s eight. Nevy Liberal Whip is
Eric Hearnshaw.
C. B. Cutler, who led the Country
party at the election in the absence
through illness of Davis Hughes,
was elected to succeed Hughes as
leader, with W. A. Chaffey as
Deputy.

Prime Minister Macmillan is believed
to have decided against an early election.
This isn’t surprising. With Foreign
Ministers’ talks arranged and a Summit
talk just around the corner, it is neither
the time to go electioneering nor to
risk a change of Government. Legally
the election can wait another 12 months,
but a more likely time is towards the
end of the year.

Bolte, who left on his overseas pro-
motion tour last Friday, won't have much
time to lose ; he’s due to embark on
July 16 from Colombo for Australia and
in the meantime is scheduled to meet
bankers, financiers and industrialists in
San Francisco, Washington, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal,
New York, London, Birmingham,
Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow and towns
in Germany, France and Italy.
Unlike his first tour, this one has the
advantage of being recognised on a top
political level and he expects to make
further progress in discussions he
initiated on his last mission. Still, official
recognition could result in more fetes and
less funds.

Trade Minister McEwen, back from
trade talks in Washington, said that U.S
officials had assured him that America
did not intend to expand its programme
for disposal of surplus primary products.
He said that he had found that even
FOR THE 1959 CAMPAIGN
senior U.S. authorities had not realised
the effect American restrictions were
having on Australia’s export trade. He
was hopeful America would relax its
quotas on lead and zinc. Next day word
came from America that Mt. Isa’s U.S.
parent company had ordered the Queens-
land concern to cut lead-production by
another 14 per cent, in 1959-60.

The Associated Chambers of Manu-
facturers have asked the Federal Gov-
ernment to abolish the payroll-tax over
the next two years, beginning with a cut
in the rate when the August Budget is
prepared. R. W. C. Anderson, director
of the Associated Chambers, in announc-
ing this decision, said the tax rejected the
principle of “ability to pay” .because it
was applied irrespective of whether the
employer concerned was making profits
or not. By adding to costs at every
stage it had an inflationary effect which
outweighed any benefits derived by the
Treasury.

No Federal party leaders were invited
to Tasmania for the State election cam-
paign. It was a rush business, anyway,
but it seems probable that both Libs

fine their case to local issues. The sight
of a Federal politician might remind the
electors of Federal M.P.’s salaries and
that might have repercussions on the
local parties.

Queensland Premier Nicklin returned
from Canberra confident that the Prime

the bank while in New York. •

New Zealand has repaid in full the
£lO-million loan advanced by Australia
last year. The original terms provided
for repayment in eight quarterly instal-

unexpected improvement in the
Dominion’s oversea-funds position made
the earlier redemption possible.
“Mugga Way”: Some of the
benighted who believe that the
Russians are living in prosperous
freedom should take note of the
frequent “jamming” of United
Nations, American and other broad-
casts. No Soviet broadcasts to other
countries are jammed, but the
Russian army of jammers is one 'of the
largest radio-systems in the world. In
1948 it had about a dozen transmitters,
but the number is now estimated at 2500,
representing a capital investment of about
£lOO million and an annual operating-cost
of nearly £5O million. It broadcasts
nothing but meaningless noise, but it pre-
vents the people of the Communist bloc
from hearing the truth about a lot of
happenings in the outside world.

Oddly, at a time when there is con-
sternation about the U.S. restriction on
imports of Australian lead and zinc
following a world oversupply, there is
concern among Australian cattle
authorities about the slaughter of our
dairy-herds for export to the U.S.A.,
where high prices for all kinds of beef
have followed a drop in exports from
the Argentine—caused by previous over-
slaughter of herds to cash-in on high
meat prices. (Some comments on the
Australian beef boom appear on page
20, this issue.)


Although the Victorian State Labor
M.P.s had earlier approved the move for
higher salaries, under orders from the
A.L.P. executive they opposed the bill
when it came before the House last week.
As in the Federal Parliament, they are
fully aware that it will go through
despite their opposition.
This led Bolte, who introduced the
bill, to say of the Opposition: “They
remind me of a filleted fish ; lost their
backbone, lost their intestines.” He said
to Labor members: “I know you over
there. You will squirm for a day and
be paid for three years.”

Balked by shortage of funds in its
plan to build blocks of multi-story flats
in Glebe and Camperdown, Sydney City
Council now proposes to raise the extra
cash by selling three of its hotels. At
least, that’s the official story, but Liberal
and D.L.P. aldermen suspect it’s a
phony because the council is calling for
tenders for sale or lease. A year ago the
Labor majority on the council refused
to sell these pubs, and the suspicion is
that they are stalling until the June A.L.P.
conference, which may issue a directive.
To a comment by Communist Aider-
man Wright that if the breweries bought
the hotels it would not help the public,
Alderman Thom (D.L.P.) replied that it
was the business of breweries to run
hotels, but it wasn’t the business of the
council. Right enough. Nor is it the
business of the council to run multi-
storied blocks of flats.

So far the only reply India has re-
ceived from Peking to its protest against
portions of India being included in maps
of China is that the maps were drawn in
Chiang Kai-shek’s time and the present
regime hasn’t yet had time to correct
them. Nehru says he has told China that
this is a very inadequate answer. China
has not replied. Perhaps Mao is trying
to decide whether his cartographers
should make another great leap forward

In a Meet-the-Press TV-tussle on the

won on points against a team of Mel-
bourne “Herald’s” soundest and most
experienced journalists. M.H.R.s, de-
lighted to hear it, have been asking for
a re-showing in Sydney.
The pressmen’s questions were, of
course, a bit shop-soiled by the time the
Federal Treasurer got behind the
cameras, and some of the facts Holt
brought out were newish, giving him
an edge on material; but his come-on-
now-old-boy-be-reasonable manner was
persuasive, and he was bland and better-
tempered and altogether more convincing
than the Prime Minister.

Although the A.C.T.U. denies it, there

is alarming some of the more moderate

The Hospital Employees’ Union suggests
the A.C.T.U. should concentrate on Aus-

“Informal” is usually among the leaders
on Senate ballot-papers, a state of affairs
that vexes successful and unsuccessful
politicians alike, and suggests that the
teaching of civics in the schools could
be improved. Senator John Marriott,
convenor of a Parliamentary committee
interested in ways of reducing the in-
formal vote, is now circularising various
political bodies for their ideas. Several
have already supported the identification
of candidates with political parties. There
is still considerable support for a circular
ballot-paper, to eliminate the unfair
advantage gained now by the party which
draws first place on the paper.

While the Australian Government
awaits with some anxiety a decision on
the plea for the “freezing” of inter-
national territorial claims in the Antarc-
tic, the Russians and the Americans are
calmly asserting that they are in the
area to stay. American Rear-Admiral
George Dufek has been advocating a
year-round, land-based airfield on the
Antarctic continent and nuclear plants
to provide heat, light and power for
U.S. stations there. He says the airfield
could support Great Circle flights of
commercial jet - airliners, which he
believes will be using the Antarctic routes
within 10 years.

The average motor - vehicle uses 410
gallons of petrol a year now, compared
with 370 gallons 10 years ago, probably
because people are using their cars more

to an estimate by the Institute of Public
Affairs Victoria. It seems those railway
and tramway deficits will get bigger and
worse.

Parliamentarians from 16 Common-
wealth Territories, including such widely
scattered areas as Aden, Basutoland,
Fiji, North Borneo, Kenya and West
Indies, have been in Britain attend-
ing the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association’s eighth course in parliamen-
tary practice. The gathering, which in-
cluded the Speakers of the Indian and
West Indian Parliaments, heard British
M.P.s, officials of the House and political
parties and civil servants lecturing on
such topics as question-time, adjourn-
ment-motions, elections and the party-
system. To round-off the course they
should have dropped-in on Canherra for

“No wonder there’s nation-wide resent-

the Commonwealth Government has in-
vaded every avenue of our lives ; and,
what is worse, the financial policy of
the States is not laid down by Common-
wealth Ministers, but by departmental
heads and long-haired economists.” The
speaker was John Galbally, Opposition
Leader in the Victorian Legislative Coun-
cil. Forgetting, apparently, how Chifley
invaded our lives, Liberal Ministers
listened in respectful agreement, and the
Country party hear-heared heartily. It
was the most popular speech the Council
had heard for months.

Import-licensing is influencing motor-
manufacturers in America, England and
Europe to extend their manufacturing
activities in Australia. Firstly because
of an expected growth in the Australian
market, and secondly, because they feel
it is wiser to increase the Australian
content of their product than to rely on
the import of components. A review of
the motor-vehicle industry, released by
the Department of Trade, says Australia
is well on the way towards the establish-
ment of a motor-vehicle industry which
can stand on its own feet in peace or war.
As a result of existing expansion of the
industry, Australia is now saving about
£lOO million annually in foreign exchange.
In addition, the expanded industry pro-
vides employment, directly or indirectly,
for over 100,000 persons. Capital invest-
ment in the industry increased from a
prewar £lO million to over £lOO million
in 1957, and expansion plans totalling
£36 million will be undertaken in the
near future.

There is no prospect at present of
raising the school-leaving age to 16,
Queensland Education Minister Pizzey
said recently. Existing accommodation
could not cope with the extra numbers
involved, even though by the end of its
three-year term in office the Nicklin
Government would have doubled the
number of high - schools and also the
number of high-school enrolments. In
Queensland the school-leaving age is 14.
This is also the effective age in Victoria,
South Australia and Westralia, although
all three States have provided for a rise
to 15 years when accommodation per-
mits. In New South Wales the age is 15 ;
in Tasmania 16.

hasn’t succeeded. In Halle, a town of

Brisbane musician Robert Dalley-
Scarlett, world authority on Handel and

active conductorship of the Brisbane

His main reason for retiring is that he

he’s had 59 years of conducting choirs,
and that’s a pretty fair record with
choirs. He’s especially busy at the
moment: 1959 is the bicentenary - year
of the death of Handel, and his services
as a Handel authority are much in

Talk veering south, as natural in con-
versation with an Antarctic explorer,
Professor Frank Debenham was asked
if he had read Douglas Stewart’s “Fire
on the Snow.” “No-o.” Then, quickly,
he said that he knew Stewart’s poetry,
and admired it. This was the day after
Professor Debenham and Griffith Taylor, the
two surviving members of Scott’s 1910-13
expedition, received their honorary doctorates
at Sydney Uni.
Professor Debenham was discovered relax-
ing over a typewriter amid the lawns and trees
of Turramurra, on Sydney’s North Shore line:
a fair, cheerful man of 76 with exquisite
manners, wearing a red tie and a black
smoker’s cap. The professor will be going
back to England soon, and it seemed a pity
that he and Douglas Stewart hadn't met; inter-
viewer said so, adding that Dougias, at morning-
tea, had expressed alarm at meeting an expert.
“No, no,” the professor protested. “He’s the
expert —in poetry. I write a little —well, I
wouldn’t call it poetry, doggerel, really, and I
imitate. him. Ape, perhaps, is the better
word.”
It is a word no one else would dream of
using in the context of Professor Debenham.
Born, like another famous Australian, Bradman,
at Bowral (N.S.W.), he went to The King’s
School, Parramatta, then took an Arts course
at Sydney University, was a teacher at The
Armidale School, came" back to do science,
studying geology under Professor David, and
was introduced to Scott by David. He sat
for his finals, by special dispensation of the
Senate, after returning from Antarctica, then
went to Cambridge. Wounded at Salonika
after a stint on the Somme, he finished War I
as a major, and became a Fellow of Gonville
and Caius College in 1919, then tutor, Reader
in Geography, and Professor of Geography
from 1930 to 1949. He is also founder and
a former director of the Scott Polar Research
Institute. In 1945 the Colonial Office sent him
to Africa to report on water resources from
the Rhodesias up to Uganda.
Apart from verse —interviewer saw a rondeau,
and some charming light verse about Austra-
lian animals —he writes a variety of books.
One, just out in German, has some magnificent
Antarctic photographs; an English edition, and
a couple of other books, are with the printer;
and he is writing a simple manual of surveying

[From R. S. Porteous (“Standby”)!
When William Albert Amiet, M.A.,
died on April 13, Mackay (Q.) lost its
best-known and best-loved citizen. His
brilliance, his sparkling but always
kindly wit, and his dry human under-
standing charmed all who met him.
For 40 years Mackay claimed him as
its own. No civic reception, no important
occasion was complete without him. Yet
he was a humble man. His ability to
speak many languages fluently—perhaps
even more his profound knowledge of


astronomy —made him regard himself
always as (to quote him) “a very small
cog in this vast universe.”
Since an infirmity kept him from
marching he stood at the Cenotaph at
every Anzac Day dawn-parade, his sturdy
figure and white hair almost as familiar
as the Cenotaph itself.

to the manager’s job in Melbourne, and
once more to Sydney, as assistant-
manager. Last January he was appointed
manager of the Royal Exchange branch
in Macquarie Place, Sydney, serving
what he calls “the golden - end of the
city” woolbuyers and shipping - firms,
insurance-companies and the Stock Ex-
change—to say nothing of the proposed
future expansion round Circular Quay.
Incidentally, the original branch of the
Bank of N.S.W. was established in 1817
at Mrs. Reiby’s cottage, only a few doors
away from the Royal Exchange branch.

Barry Stern, founder of the Museum
of Modern Art in Sydney, as a young
man who holds definite views on the
future of Australian art. His aims in ‘
starting this museum are to put on view
a collection of paintings which reflect
distinct Australian national charac-
teristics, and to develop public awareness
of modern trends in artistic expression.
At present the collection is housed tem-
porarily in a top-floor flat in George
Street, open to the public only on Satur-
days and Sundays, 1 p.m. till midnight,
and over the lunch-period on Mondays ;
but he’s hoping to raise money to
buy the Grosvenor Gallery and put his
increased collection there. He has 20
pictures on display some loaned by
friends and well-wishers, some his own
gift—set-out deliberately in the spacious
living-room to show there is no clash
in harmony between modern artistic
form and his reproduction baroque and
Louis XV furniture.
Stern, now 26, was born in Sydney
and educated at Newington. After leaving
school, he spent a year touring Europe
and visited museums and art-galleries in
London and on the Continent. Coming
back to Sydney, he worked for seven
years in the family-business, and then
opened his museum. He paints, writes
poetry, and is acting-president of the
Poetry Society of Australia.

a yellowbelly named Ned Kelly, with
special tag attached, will be released in
the Condamine River (Cecil Plains area,
Q.) under police supervision, and between
8 a.m. and 4 p.m. local anglers, having
paid their five-bob nomination-fee (2s. 6d.
for juniors), will try for the £lOO cash-
prize for landing Edward. Four other
tagged fish will also be released with
lesser prices on their gills. It will all
help swell the funds of the Nangwee
school-committee.

“Penulis”: “P. Nuyts” (B. 11/3/’59)
does not mention one of the most im-
portant uses for graphite: it is one of
the very widely used industrial-lubricants.
Wherever oil or other lubricants would
decompose because of great heat or pres-
sure, graphite is substituted. The odd
feature of this is that it is a mineral, and
minerals are usually reckoned to be
abrasives. In addition, graphite is chemi-
cally identical with diamond, and, like
that more valuable substance, almost
always soils the fingers of anyone touch-
ing it.

“Tully-Innis”: “Seedy’s” tale of the
gambler who danced on his hat (B.
1 /4/’59) recalls the Sicilian gang’s refusal
to accept the cane-inspector’s price on
the bottom paddock. They demanded the
magistrate, but that worthy was un-
available immediately, due to pressure of
court business. When he did arrive,
closely followed by organiser and cane-
growers’ secretary, the men were togged
for town, ganger resplendent in green
slacks, yellow shirt, ox-blood shoes and
grey fedora. Without changing, he
walked to the field and pointed out the
weeds and entanglements to the Beak,
who, after deliberating, .. refused the
requested increase. The ganger looked
around wildly—the magistrate was clearly
A YEAR AGO
A year ago that hill was afire,
The shout of voices, cry of stock,
Was screaming leaves, the moon turned
red.
Was day, was war, the hill was fire.
The cattle ran on hoofs of flame.
The sheep fell burning in their wool.
The big trees wrenched their bodies free
And shouted triumph up in flame.
A horse ran mad and killed a man.
Its gaping nostrils breathed the smoke
Of burning mane and it plunged in
And burnt a house where lived a man,
The house v.’as day. The rearing horse
Was twisted head and gleaming teeth,
Was scream and scream from outside
night.
The fire rode upon the horse.
It was a sign to catch the heart.
It made us stand and watch it burn —
The hill, the man, the horse and all
That world that one time shaped the
heart.
All close, familiar things were strange.
The self beyond the self we knew
—The death, the madness of our will —
Now shouted to our sight. Not strange
That it should show its truth;
The moment comes when things must be
What they might most deny, defy.
A year ago we saw our truth.
A year ago the world was fire.

sacrosanct, and the organiser was six-
foot-two. His eyes fell on the hapless
secretary, and, taking his hat off, he made
towards him. He propped within 3ft. of
the official, and, placing the derby on the
ground, leapt upon it, glaring and swear-
ing. Not to be outdone, the sec. took off
his own hat, equally new, placed it in the
dirt beside the other, and took to the air.
When he landed, however, his feet were
firmly planted on the Sicilian’s hat, which
by then was almost unrecognisable from
the battering. Calmly the sec. /reached
down, lifted his own, shook the dust off
it, and was in the car and away before
Guliano’s mate recovered his breath.

“Cuttie”: In his article on Professor
Holmes’s attitude to Keyline (B.
25/3/’59) John Henry states that P. A.
Yeomans introduced to Australia the
first chisel-plough. In that case the pro-
pounder of the Keyline theory must be
a very old man, as there was a chisel-
“It’s a solar-powered producer of ultra-violet rays for use on rainy days”
plough on my grandfather’s property
outside Warwick (Q.) 50 years ago. As
my forebear imported most of his plant
from Ransome’s, England, they were
most likely the makers. The principle
was the same —from Hin. points to
winged shears 12in. and over wide, and
go down as far as one liked. It was never
used much, as it was a horse-killer, but
it would be good behind a 50 h.-p. tractor.

“Arev”: A missionary who served
many years up North tells me how a half-
caste girl forecasts the sex of the next
child. If the previous child has hair
which comes to a point at the nape of
the neck, the girl said, the next child
will be a daughter. The missionary
claimed it worked.
/'''ran called in just as tall, slim Melissa
was setting-off for a polo-barbecue,
polished - cotton reinforced by four

Gran was not impressed; merely re-
marking that 50 years ago namesake
Great-Aunt Melissa —now a comfortable
dowager, but then a skinny flapper—had
attended a salmagundi-party in frothy
muslin and Valenciennes, five starched
petticoats, further foundationed by a
chemise, an embroidered white-flannel
petticoat and frilled drawers! Dictionary
explanation of “salmagundi” as “mince-
meat, etc.,” doesn’t throw much light on
the nature of the long-ago party ; sounds
like a rissole-supper! Anyone know? —
“Talbingo.”

“Merrangbaur”: A vet. I know was
speeding to an equine patient during the
dark hours when his progress was halted
abruptly—a straying draught-horse had
decided to exercise his right-of-way. The
vet. climbed out, inspected the cause and
result of the collision, and promptly
reached for his little black bag. In the
glare of his lone remaining headlight he
squirted painkiller into Dobbin, per-
formed an emergency operation, sewed
him up neatly, led the groggy animal
into the nearest paddock, and took-off
again on his way. That vet. did such a
good job that the farmer has yet to
discover that he now owns a gelding.

“Jeyles”: We can be grateful to “Pike-
trailer” (B. 25/3/’59) for disclosing that
the name of London Zoo’s panda is
Chi Chi. That double-word, used as a
colloquial adjective, for long described
the precise English speech of Asians, and
latterly has been a derogative term im-
plying Eurasian. Frank Thring, on the
radio, recently described the thrill of
seeing the so-Australian “Seventeenth
Doll” “wowing a typical chichi London
first-night audience.” So we now deduce
that chichi (correctly pronounced “she
she”) means blase, sophisticated and con-
ventional. Now perhaps “Piketrailer”
can tidy-up the whole matter for us and
explain whether this panda’s vocal efforts
are accented, whether her birthplace
borders Europe and Asia, or whether in
the hot-house atmosphere of Regents
Park she has acquired sophistication.

“Manamoi”: Smithy’s place adjoined
the noted sheep-stud owned by Sir X.,
and the whole district knew that, though
Smithy’s ewes produced a fine crop of
high-quality lambs every year, their
owner had never possessed a ram. One
day Sir X. met his neighbor in town.
“I see, Smith, that my rams have been
getting into your paddocks again.”
“Have they now, Sir X.?” “Odd that
they never get through any other fences,
isn’t it, Smith?” “Yes, indeed, Sir X.”
“Funny that it’s only at mating-time
that they get through yours, Smith.”
“I really hadn’t noticed, Sir X.” “Funnier
still that it’s only my top stud-sires that
get through.” “Extraordinary, Sir X.”
A long pause, then, “Smith, you’re the
best bloody judge of sheep in this
district!”
* * * *
Can’t understand why so
many Australians still persist in calling
budgerigars “lovebirds.” The aboriginal
name is distinctive Aussie for a bird
distinctly Australian (although he. has
multiplied to enormous numbers in
American and English and other overseas
aviaries). Lovebirds are African. In no
respect do they resemble budgies. They
are much bigger, have a little stump of
a tail, and emit a very shrill, high-pitched
whistle. With them there is no convenient
means of distinguishing the sexes, such
as the blue wattles of the budgie cock
and the brown of the hen. Although the
African hen will nest in a wooden box
similar to a budgie’s nestbox, she first
jams the box nearly full with grass ; the
Aussie lays on bare wood or sawdust.
The African nestling is clothed with
yellow down when hatched ; the budgie’s
young are bald.

“Kelms”: Around Perth and Fre-
mantle they’re catching blowfish weigh-
ing over 91b. and taping 28in., and it
takes will-power to throw away a fish
like that. They’re north-west blowies,
and it’s usually considered those taken
are well south of their range ; but there’s
an odd one or two caught every year
between Fremantle and Mandurah, and
I’d say their range could extend probably
to the Leeuwin. Wonder is the ocean
isn’t full of them. I don’t know of any-
thing that will eat them. Fishing well
offshore, I’ve tossed them to sharks
who’ve mouthed them and spat them
out; and even seagulls won’t take them.
But they must be food to some sea-
denizen ; anyone got any clues?


'T'he old bay draught-horse now spends
-*■ most of his time leaning over the
fence talking to the skewbald pony from
next-door, and the only effort he is
called upon to make is to answer to his
name for an apple or a pat. The old
lorry is up in the hay-shed with a stack
of old drums on it; the dray is buried
under a heap of this and that, along with
the utility that was cut-down from an
old Austin 20 ; and the springcart, which
Grandpa used to drive from Carlingford
to Parramatta on market-days, although
it is new-painted, is a bit drunken about
the wheels, and every now and then the
wheels are put to soak in the horse-
trough.
It was when the tractor-drawn sprayer
blew-up that the old horse was pressed
into service with the spray-cart in the
orchard, with two men on the hoses, and
he quickly resolved any doubts about
his memory. If the men were spraying
apples and they came to a peach-tree,
he'd go straight past, or turn into the
next row without any command. He was
generous about it, too. He didn’t even
give a horse-laugh as he stepped past
the broken-down machine.

“Ajax”: Having started toil with one
of Australia’s leading coachmakers 64
years ago and spent many years making
the things, I think I’m qualified to poke
my bib in on the buggy symposium.
There were many varieties, including
Abbott, piano-box, canoe-front, hori-
zontal curved dash, cutunder, turnout
seat (inspiration for the dicky-seat in
cars), buckboard, Surrey (with canopy,
but not necessarily with the fringe on
top). The Abbott was essentially Austra-
lian in design. Angus and Son, of
Sydney's Castlereagh Street, were noted
for Abbott buggies. Haining was another
well-known Sydney coachbuilder. Hilliers
turned-out thousands of two-wheeled
“sulkies” at about £6 each. American
firms, notably Studebaker, exported huge
numbers of vehicles to Australia “in the
white” (unpainted). They cost almost as
much to paint here—12 to 14 coats —
as the landed cost from America, which
was incredibly low. These vehicles were
noted for grace and extremely light
weight, about half that of Australian-
built vehicles. A great variety of in-
genious designs, particularly on under-
carriages, were available. The piano-box
type was one of the most popular.
“Jobber”: I shall never forget the day
I sat next to Lawson on a bench at the
old Bulletin office, not far from our
Mecca —the hideout of cash-dispenser
McMahon. Lawson made several
entries to the little accountant’s office,
and was gently ushered out. I had wished
Henry good morning, and he said, “You
are a bush boy, aren’t you?” I admitted
it, adding that I had had a meal at the
“lonely pub in the mulga scrub” at Lake
Eliza and had waltzed Matilda into
Yantabulla. He advised me not to worry
about Lake Eliza, and proceeded to
lecture me on the evils of strong drink
and the snares and pitfalls of a great
city! He was still waiting to see Tom
McMahon when I left with my cheque.
THE LAWSON "LEGEND"
Although Cecil Mann (B. 15/4/’59)
had not met Henry Lawson —to
which I say, hard luck, Cecil, as his was
a face worth somewhat more than a
passing glance!—he’s certainly had more
than a glance at the legacy of the master
delineator of the Australian bush scene
and the Australian bushmen.
Whilst on the subject of meeting “our
Henry,” as we natives of his old home-
ground are apt to call him, I can’t, of
course, estimate the number of people
who did meet' him outside the Mudgee
district, but I can assure Cecil there are
many of that old town's citizens living
who can claim the honor. These include
the present Mayor of Mudgee, Robert
Roth, and others, like this scribe, who
have drifted afield. Like the present
Mayor, we used to “dive in the shaded
pools” of the oak-lined Pipeclay Creek,
within a half-mile of Lawson’s old home,
now replaced by a fitting memorial.
Can’t quite agree that Henry did not
“New or old ?”
find interest in the Australian scenery.
He lived in our region, Eurunderee, for
about 10 years of his youth (came there
when seven), and when he revisited there,
as he frequently did, evinced a lively
interest in that “strip” of Australia. It
would be logical to say that it would
have made a considerable impression on
the young mind, and that he “knew”
this section of our land, which, by the
way, is not comparatively “arid”; a
26in. annual rainfall isn’t all that bad!
The origins of that region are some-
thing like this. First, a few big holdings
were granted ; then came the gold-
strikes, the Log Paddock and Golden
Gully, and then the division of the land
into small holdings. Too small. It was
hard going, and Lawson’s people, in
common with many of ours, would have
experienced anything but luxury! And
these are the people he would have
known. An apparently casual people, by
no means always unhappy, who, when
on for a yarn, were good at the telling.
This is borne out by Henry, who used
many of them, setting them down in his
own unrivalled manner.
He certainly knew his bush and bush-
men, and had the tremendous talent of
relating a story which became a gem of
literature. Like a master batsman, of
the Bradman-McCabe-Kippax class, who
knew what to do with every ball, Lawson
placed every word as only a master
would—in the right place. His were the
ordinary words of our language, but how
he could use them!
There was not much offering in our
region for a young chap like Henry, and
many others. I’m sure “Brian James”
(John Tierney), who once dwelt within
a couple of furlongs of the old Lawson
home, would vouch for this, and if any-
one could speak with some authority
on Henry, then John could. So, like
others, Lawson drifted. He toured much
of the back-country and not in the easy
way either. His was no seven-days’
fleeting glimpse of Australia, like a lot
of people who visit here and can come
up with a book on the “land and its
people.” The city knew him, and he
knew the city. He was not so keen on
much that he saw there, either.
But we should not forget that Lawson
was different; a dreamer with a
tremendous talent. He did not seem to
belong to any particular section of our
land; he belonged to Australia. And
I’m quite sure that, with his experiences
in the Australian bush scene, he could
speak with authority on a substantial
area of Australia.

NEW GUINEA INCOME-TAX
"Dills to introduce income-tax
into Papua-New Guinea
passed their second reading in
the New Guinea Legislative
Council on April 20 and then
that Chamber adjourned until
June. The three elected Coun-
cillors said they would stay
in the Council long enough to
debate the measure, then
resign.
The proposal, before it
reached the actual legislative
stage, was criticised in the
Canberra Representatives on
March 18 by Liberal member
Roy Wheeler on the ground
that the proposal followed only
a departmental inquiry and not
a public inquiry, and that there
should be no taxation without
political representation.
To this Paul Hasluck,
Minister for External Terri-
tories, replied that the report
of the departmental inquiry
was tabled in the Papuan-N.G.
Leg. Council last October in
order to attract debate there
and comment from residents
throughout the Territory. Re-
sults of the debate, and press
and individual comment, had
been sent to Canberra and dis-
cussed in Cabinet.
As to introducing taxation
without political representa-
tion, Mr. Hasluck claimed that
taxation was already levied in
the Territory, and. had been
for many years annual
revenue from taxes was already
£5 million a year. The reason
for introducing income-tax was
to replace existing forms of
taxation with a more equitable
system and one which would
encourage greater develop-
ment.
The upshot of the whole con-
troversy has been the intro-
duction in the Port Moresby
Legislative Council of a bill
which imposes, for the first
time, income-tax on com-
panies and residents, natives
and otherwise (or “indigenes”
and “non - indigenes,” in
departmentalese), though a
proposed amendment exempt-
ing taxable incomes of under
£lO5 would leave most natives
free from income-tax.
Company-tax will be 4s. in
the £, slightly more than half
the Australian maximum rate
(7s. 6d. in the £).
"I’m afraid Mr. Dawbell is flat-out right now—
could you ring later ?”
Mining profits and dividends
will not be exempt, and the
tax-freedom of mining calls
will be revised.
Income from the sale of
prospecting-rights and divi-
dends from the rights will be
exempt, and the Australian
subsidy on oil-drilling has been
included.
But some concessions in
relation to depreciation, etc.,
allowed to Australian primary
industries are not included.
However, business losses,
incurred after July 1 this year
may be carried forward and
offset against profits during the
next seven years.
Because of higher allowable
deductions, and a lower tax-
scale, the income-tax is claimed
by the Territory Treasurer,
H. H. Reeve, to be “well be-
low half the Australian rates.”
When the taxation bills are
brought into force it is pro-
posed to abolish export-duties
and to decrease import-duties
“significantly.”
Export-duties are now paid
on copra, cocoa and rubber.
Import-duties are levied on
general merchandise and food-
stuffs, including imports from
Australia.
As regards personal income-
tax, the personal allowance
will be £286 ; wholly depend-
ent wife, £230 ; wholly
dependent child under 16,
£130; wholly dependent
student child, £l3O.
Medical expenses will be
allowed up to £150; life-
assurance and superannua-
tion expenses to £3OO ; educa-
tion expenses to £l5O ; medical
and hospital benefits contribu-
tion in full.
Tax on a taxable income
from £lO5 to £l2O will be a
minimum of 10s. a year.
From £l2l to £3OO, the rate
will be 6d. in the pound, then
rising to the maximum rate of
6s. Bd. on more than £12,000.
Lead-zinc Problems
'l7'oluntary (but U.S.-direct-
* ed) reduction of Mt. Isa’s
annual lead production-rate to
53,000 tons a year for 1959-60
will represent a drop of 25
p.c. on the July-November
(1958) average of 71,000 tons
p.a.
In November the rate of out-
put was cut so as to bring
1958-59 output down to 62,000
tons, but production of copper
was increased.
The 9000-tons-p.a. cut
announced in New York by
J. D. Mackenzie, chairman of
American Refining and Smelt-
ing (owners of 53,9 p.c. of
Mt. Isa’s shares), which will
operate in 1959-60 to achieve
the 25 p.c. cut on the 71,000-
ton figure, will reduce out-
put to the 53,000 tons p.a., and
is part of U.S. policy which
aims at bringing “production
of lead into line with con-
sumption.”
There is to be a meeting of
United Nations Special Com-
mittee on Lead and Zinc in
New York this week, arranged
to discuss means of dealing
with the present world over-
supply of these metals.
It is a ticklish situation. U.S.
mines have already been put
on a quota, and this was
followed by restrictions of U.S.
lead-zinc imports from, among
other countries, Australia and
Canada —with resulting outcry.
Broken Hill mines have cut
production by one day in 10,
but have lifted their Australian
selling-prices of lead and zinc
to £lOO (Aust.) at ton, com-
pared with £69 sterling in
London for lead and £72
sterling for spelter. Lead and
zinc in the U.S.A. (subject to
duty and quota) are both
around 11 cents a pound.
All Australian lead-zinc
shares reacted sharply follow-
ing the direction from New
York ’on Mt. Isa.
Meat Export Prices
Creaking at the meeting of
the Australian Agricul-
tural Council in Perth, the
Minister for Primary Industry,
C. F. Adermann, told ' the
gathering that despite extremly
bad seasonal conditions in
some parts of Queensland,
activity in the meat-export
industry has been sustained.

Queensland meatworks have
experienced a prolonged kill-
ing season, some works record-
ing the highest kill of this
century.
In other States there have
been heavy intakes of export
lambs and an increase in the
amount of mutton for export,
together with a good deal of
activity in the preparation cf
boneless cow- and bull-beef for
the U.S.A.
It is estimated that beef
exports from Australia during
1958-59 will reach the all-time
high of 160,000 tons. Last
year 125,000 tons was recorded.
Lamb exports will probably
be up 30 per cent, on the 1957-
58 figure of 29,000 tons, and
mutton exports are expected to
increase to 25,000 tons, as
compared with 18,000 tons ex-
ported last year.
Due to the influence of the
American market, export-beef
prices have reached an unpre-
cedented level, with exporters
making every. effort to take
advantage of this attractive
market. However, it would be
unwise for producers to base
their quality standards on the
assumption that the present
high prices for low-grade beef
in the United States will con-
tinue indefinitely. (This view
has lately been emphasised by
a visiting U.S. expert.)
The United Kingdom
market has also remained
strong due to reduction in
Argentine shipments probably
resulting from excessive
slaughtering of breeding stock
in that country over recent
years. Because of the rela-
tively high prices ruling for
beef in the United Kingdom,
the Australian Meat Board
decided to discontinue bounty
payments on beef exported to
the U.K. under the 15-year
■ meat-agreement as fro m
December 27, 1958.
The lamb-exporting States
have been well served by
seasonal conditions. The
quality of lamb has been
better than last year and the
numbers considerably higher.
It is evident that the swing to
crossbred-breeding for fat
lambs is continuing. Home-
market prices for lambs have
been affected adversely by the
skin-market and the expecta-
tion that prices in the United
Kingdom would become de-
pressed by the weight of in-
creased U.K. home production
and supplies from New Zea-
land. Up to the present, U.K.
lamb prices have been holding
well.
Australian market prices for
mutton have remained fairly
firm. A feature has been the
strong demand for the canner
type of sheep, due to the
demand for this mutton for
export in boneless form to the
United States.
Sydney ’Change Report
nPHE annual report of the
Sydney Stock Exchange
committee, released the same
day as the annual cocktail-
party (a very congenial func-
tion held at the Yacht
Squadron, Kirribilii), deals
with the Sydney sharemarket
for 1958, the growth of Syd-
ney ’Change’s activities, and its
extension of statistical services
during the year. There is also
a digested review of Australian
share-price movements, with an
annotated explanatory graph
showing market peaks and
troughs, from f 875 to 1958.
After traversing- the infla-
tionary boom of 1951 and the
crash of 1952, the summary
concludes:
The recovery of share prices,
beginning in late 1952, has con-
tinued to date, with some slacken-
ing in 1955-56. The reduction of
stocks after import-restrictions and
improved liquidity position of com-
panies during 1952-53 occurred in
a context of steadied prices and
relaxing import-controls.
Resumed high capital-inflow and
rising industrial profits encouraged
the restoration of share prices.
Although this recovery slackened,
particularly with rising interest-
rates and increased indirect taxes in
1956, the speed of price-increase
quickened after 1956.
Recent tendencies encouraging
this share-price increase have been
the growth of hire-purchase, rising
industrial profits, and heavy capital-
inflow, together with the expansion
of institutional investment in the
market.
So powerful have these influences
been that the fall in wool prices
and the tendencies, growing in the
latter part of 1958, to balance-of-
payments disequilibrium have been
obscured.
C.S.R. Hardboard
A new hardboard factory,
similar to the plant now
operated by the company in
Sydney, will be built at Bacchus
Marsh, a halfway stop between
Melbourne and Ballarat, by
the C.S.R., and is another
£2-million industrial feather in
Bolte's gay headdress.
Markets for the hardboard
are opening because more
imaginative uses are being

won in the Wombat forest,
and the Victorian Government

from the State forests for a
considerable period.
A.M.P. Bonuses
Tncreases in bonus-rates by
the A.M.P. Society for the
third successive year bring them
to the highest level since 1930.
This is something one would
have hardly believed possible
back in the days of p.c.
to 4 p.c. long-term Govern-
ment loans.
Diversification of invest-
ment has had a strong in-
fluence in the improvement of
A.M.P. bonuses, as in the case
of other life-offices.
For several years after the
war investment emphasis was
on equity shares. Now there
is a tendency to shift to fixed-
interest securities giving a
higher yield than highly priced


front-rank ordinary shares.
And the long-term bond-rate,
of course, is now up to 5 p.c.
Interest earnings are one of
the chief sources of surplus
for a life-office’s bonuses to
policy holders. The other
factors are low mortality and
economy of management.
The return to high bonus-
rates by the A.M.P. are
particularly commendable in
view of its well - known
liberality in surrender-values
and loan-values.

Referring to the rejection of
Electronic Industries’ takeover
proposals, Mr. Webb indicated
that the book-value of H.P.’s
net assets at £5 6s. Bd. per ord.
share was substantially less
than real values.
Earning-capacity, at present
relatively below that of Elec-
tronic Industries, was expected
to lift upon completion of
present modernisation plans.
One aspect of the two dis-
turbances affecting H.P.—the
palace revolution over its
capital-expenditure and invest-
ment policy, and the takeover
bid by Sir Electronic Warner
• —has been the fact that a lot
more air and light have been
brought into the boardroom.
Bearing Service
T>earing Service (Holdings),
Ltd., a highly successful
post-war Stock Exchange list-
ing, has reported a slightly
lower profit for its latest half-
year, brought about by higher
expenses and temporary
disturbance to operations.
A report has now come
from London stating that the
Timken Roller Bearing Co. of
Ohio (U.S.A.) has offered to
buy the 47 p.c. of the shares in
British Timken, Ltd., not
already owned by it.
Some complications arising
from separate control of the
U.S. and the U.K. Timken
companies have already been
evident in Australia.
Last year Bearing Service
(Holdings), Ltd., was appointed
sole distributor in Australia and
N.Z. for Australian Timken
Pty., Ltd., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Timken
Roller Bearing Co., of Canton,
Ohio, U.S.A., the largest
tapered-bearing manufacturer
in the world. The Australian
factory was set-up in Ballarat.
At the same date the Bearing
Service group, which has sub-
sidiaries in every State, ceased
to act as distributors for bear-
ings made in England by
British Timken, Ltd., which
formed its own Australian dis-
tributing subsidiary, handling
Timken and F.B.C. ball- and
parallel-roller-bearings.
Until last year all Bearing
Service supplies were imported.
In addition to the British
Timken and Fischer (F.8.C.)
bearings, it has been distribut-
ing Hoffman bearings, as well
as supplies from other manu-
facturers in the U.K., U.S.A.
and Switzerland.
If the U.S. company gains
full control of the British
Timken co. it will acquire with
it full control of the bearing-
distributing offshoot in Aus-
tralia, which is at present in
competition with Bearing Ser-
vice (Holdings), Ltd.
At this juncture it might not
be out of place for the directors
of Bearing Service to advise
shareholders as to the nature of
their tie-up with the Ohio
company and its Australian
manufacturing subsidiary.
Reid Murray “Look-over”
'T'he arrival in Brisbane of
O. J. O’Grady, managing-
director of Reid Murray Hold-
ings, has prompted some specu-
lation. It is evident that
although Queensland is the
only State without a Reid
Murray retail outlet, it is not
likely to remain so for long.
Current suggestions for a
Reid Murray look-over are
retailers T. C. Beirne and Allan
and Stark, furniture-retailer
John Hicks, Ltd., and electrical
retailers Chandlers (Aust.), Ltd.,
and Packard Bell Pty., Ltd.
On current form, Reid
Murray would be likely to
select an organisation which
will provide business for Reid
Murray Acceptance Corp., the
hire-purchase subsidiary. This,
coupled with the fact that sub-
sidiary Robert Reid is firmly
entrenched in wholesale soft-
goods trade, and its customers
might object to its acquisition
of a department-store, seems to
rule-out T. C. JBeirne and Allan
and Stark.
The other “quality” which
Reid Murray look for is
management. Here we find
that Chandlers (Aust.) and its
subsidiary, J. B. Chandler In-
vestment Co., are capably
headed by Sir John Chandler,
while John Hicks has a board
with an excellent record.
Thiess Issue
HThe announcement of a one-
for-one par issue by Thiess
Holding, Ltd. (Brisbane) left
the market guessing. Although
one of the most anticipated
issues for some time, the
investors took several days to
assess its value.
__ On one hand, shareholders
are invited to participate in an
issue to double their holdings.
This from a company whose
shares command a 150 p.c.
premium would be most wel-
come. However, on the other
hand the company says that
it may have to drop its divi-
dend front the current 16f p.c.
to as low as 10 p.c. on the in-
creased capital.
The new issue will raise an
additional £437,870. working-
capital, and more will be sought
by an issue of unsecured notes
and by bank accommodation.
Queensland Woollen Trade
Queensland’s woollen trade
is largely influenced by the
weather, and over the last few
years the northern State has
experienced rather mild winters,
with the result that companies
such as Bruce Pie Industries
and Queensland Woollen
Manufacturing Co. have
suffered.
Throughout the trade there
has been a reluctance on the
part of most retailers to place
other than stock-replacement
orders. This, as well as the
fall in the value of wool, has
resulted in smaller turnover,
higher manufacturing-costs,
and constricted profits.
Unless there is a return to
true winter conditions in the
near future, Queensland
woollen - manufacturers can’t
hope for a better half-year.

ART
Stage and Music
“Marcus”
“I am” asserts our be-
wildered and regrettably
deceased hero as the curtain
falls on the concluding act of
this interesting new play by
the young Melbourne writer-
actor Alan Hopgood, currently
cutting its dramatic teeth at the
Union Theatre and nicely
handled by the University's
Marlowe Society.
The abovementioned “I
am” has, of course, distinct
philosophical undertones. To
come to this conclusion the
play’s youthful hero had first
to undergo a series of searching
allegorical experiences, help-
fully listed in the programme
as Birth, Dreams, Roguery,
Desire, Defeat, Wisdom and
Sympathy, Companionship,
Faith, Forgiveness, Love,
Hero-worship, Ambition, Self-
realisation, Struggle, Death;
and finally Return.
You may now see what the
playwright is getting at, how
vast and ambitious is his
canvas. He is concerned with
Man’s progress through life
and his ultimate physical and
spiritual fate. Hopgood says in
effect —and he makes no pre-
tence of originality in this —
that Man has common wants
and that h s world has a stock-
pile of obstacles and that the
chances of his defining just
what he wants and then over-
coming the obstacles are very
slight indeed.
And this is where the play,
like so many of its kind, falls
down. And it would seem here
to be the fault of Hopgood's
script rather than of George
Ogiivie’s ingenious and finely
detailed production.
Hopgood does not create in
his characters a convincing
want: he constantly tells us
that they desire such-and-such
—love, power, security and so-
forth —but we hear him only
in our heads, so that the
apparent desperate needs and
lacks of these characters are
not adequately conveyed and
they do not move us.
Language is another diffi-
culty. “Marcus” evokes a
lyrical atmosphere it has
affinities with the Tennessee
Williams of “Camino Real,”
even the Shakspeare of
“Romeo and Juliet” — and
Hopgood and Ogilvie do well
in maintaining an ethereal yet
actual world. But Hopgood’s
mixture of poetics and prose
drags heavily at times, missing-
out on the rhythms of speech,
and he is far too prolix with
such words as “infect,” “belly, ’
“drain,” etc. Also his other-
wise well-drawn characters too
often express themselves as if
they all graduated from the
same highfalutin college.
Their actions, however, are
another kettle of fish alto-
gether ; in fact, the movement
and flow of the play are its
happiest aspect. This is where
the theatrical imagination of
its author is most evident.
Altogether “Marcus” has
an impressive vitality, but at
this stage it is more an idea
than a finished work of art, and
it could do with much
rewriting.
Hopgood’s Giotto stood out
amidst a number of excellent
characterisations, includ-
ing Nicolov’s drunken Thomas,
William Blake’s Padillo, Kira
'Daniel’s Girl in Red and John
Deverall’s Preacher Man.
In the difficult title-role Guy
McNicholl lacked assurance in
the early stages and thus failed
to establish the peculiar search-
ing uncertainty of Marcus’s
character ; but he came good
later and showed himself to be
a young actor with a lot of
promise.

“Eriks”
Maree Tomasetti and
George Fairfax won the
annual “Eriks,” on the vote
of Melbourne drama-critics,
for the best performances of
the year—she for her per-
formance as the Citizen’s Wife
in “The Knight of the Burning
Pestle,” he for his Lt. Barney
Greenwald in the Little’s pro-
ducfion of “The Caine Court
Martial.”
Peter Randall won the Doha
Ribush producers’ award for
“The Caine Court Martial”
and the Irene Mitchell award
for the best Australian-designed
set went to Frank Hinder for
“The Shifting Heart.”
“The Caine Court Martial”
was in all respects an illustrious
production ; it was bought for
commercial TV despite its
cost. Kevin Coleman, who
played Queeg, was highly com-
mended by the critics, and
many theatregoers felt he had
given the performance of the
year in it.
Maree Tomasetti is (or
ought to be) equally well-
known in Sydney as in Mel-
bourne. She ha's been in the
first few for the award in some
of the five years in which it has
been presented.
“Seven Nuns”
“Seven Nuns at Las Vegas,”
put' on in the Albert Hall,
Brisbane, by the Villanova
Players, is an amusing comedy
in its own right because it is
grounded in a genuinely ex-
ploitable situation. An arthritic
nun in a North American
climate prays for a bit of sun-
light, and overnight their entire
convent of seven nuns is
miraculously set up on the
outskirts of Las Vegas. No
sooner is it there than it enters
into direct competition with
the saloons, with the ultimate
triumph of missionary zeal over
gambling-fever.
The difficuity is to make
totally different personalities
come through the sameness of
the nun’s habits, and all seven
actresses were successful in this
regard—perhaps the Sister
Edna of Margaret Hayes win-
ning on sheer theatricality.
As happened in the -medieval
moralities, the worldy charac-
ters carried the day, particu-
larly the three Las Vegas
“hostesses” who visited the
convent.
“The Billion Dollar Saint,”
the male offering for the pro-
gramme, was nowhere near as
good a piece of theatre, either
in theme or presentation.

Post and Firkusny
Joseph Post returned to the
concert platform in Brisbane
after a long absence to lead
the Queensland Orchestra
through the first of the much-
heralded “Centenary” concerts.
The programme was largely
19th century spiced with a
sharply etched Fourth Piano
Concerto by Martinu. Rudolf
Firkusny was the soloist in
this, the first Australian per-
formance, as he was in the
world premiere two years ago
in Edinburgh. He had a great
deal of percussive playing to
cope with while the orchestra
countered with quite frankly
romantic outpourings that were
not disguised by the tang of
modern harmonies.
The real novelty of the con-
cert was the use of the soloist
for most of the first half. There
have been occasions when a
conductor's time has been
wasted accompanying pianists.
This was not one of them, and
Firkusny came back after the
well-received Martinu to play
even more brilliantly in Rach-
maninoff’s Paganini Variations.
The diabolical flickerings of
the tune through the music and
the constant shadow of the old
Latin hymn “Dies Irae” over
the whole piece were all
handled imaginatively. This,
with due attention to the full-
blown popular tune that Holly-
wood found in the middle of
the work some years ago, made
it the success of the concert.
Dvorak’s Second Symphony
was another matter. Apar*
from some rough string tone,
it was given complete devo-
tion by conductor and players.
Yet if this is what Dvorak
Moliere in Brisbane
The efforts of “Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme” to ape society
are as full of meaning (and
warning) for today's Mr.
Nouveau-Riche as for their
17th-century prototype; and
Brisbane’s Twelfth Night
Theatre presented Moliere’s
play with much style, expense
and verve —though it would
have been better to present the
piece strictly in terms of its
true period and avoid easy
lapses into modernism. (Per-
haps the translation used gave
a false lead.)
Cleonte, posing as a Turk,
should still retain vestiges of
his true, elegant self. The
rightness of Gordon Davies’s
Count Dorante only high-
lighted the deficiencies of
others, and when he was joined
by Patricia MacDonald their
scenes were the highlights of
style for the piece.
James Stevens could not re-
duce his own intelligence into
the mould of the basically
.stupid “Gentilhomme.” Too
often, when M. Jourdain
should have appeared totally
ridiculous, Stevens’s wise eye
turned the tables of comedy
completely in his favor. In
her own workmanlike way
Blanche Lather made a more
plausible character of his
neglected Madame.

The music is ponderously
serious, and for long stretches
pretty dull. There are not
enough flashes of Dvorak’s
genius for simple, unaffected
melody, and instead of the
racy passion of the later
symphonies we have only
sound workmanship, which is
not nearly good enough.

Feld Quartet
The final concerts of this
ensemble's Sydney season
included Mozart’s “Hunt”
Quartet (K 458), in which
rhythms at headlong pace w'ere

sions, with entry-attacks clear
and clean.
Beethoven’s Quartet, Op. 95,

the same composer’s first
“Rasoumovsky” Quartet, with
a fi&al movement of great

Landscapes
The “Australian Landscape
Exhibition” at Farmer’s Blax-
land Galleries, Sydney, should
have had some less ambitious
title, for many important land-
scapists from all States are
omitted.
Quite a few of the paintings,
too, including Thomas Gleg-
horn’s swirling white and
purple “Coast Wind” and
Robert Juniper’s pink geometry
in “Landscape,” to say nothing
of lesser works, have little per-
ceptible relation to the earth,
the sea or the sky.
But at all events it is a
liberal exhibition, by no means
confined to one school. On
the one hand there is the
fidel ty to Nature by no
means incompatible with a
fresh approach of Robert
Grieve’s remarkably solid and
attractive “Sea Cliffs, Wye
River” and J. Carington
Smith’s impressionistic “Bush
Landscape” ; and on the other
hand there is the looser but still
valid symbolism of Judy
Cassab’s softly flowing,
“Willows” and the monumental
simplification of Herbert
Flugleman’s mauve tree and
immensities of rock.
Charles Bush shows Mel-
bourne looking surprisingly
like Venice ; Phyl Waterhouse
impeccably says the right thing
about light filtering through
trees; Sali Herman gets a
striking effect out of orange
brick-kilns and sand or clay
that looks like snow; Lloyd
Rees is looser than usual in
“Storm at Werri”; W. E.
Pidgeon is faintly troubling in
“Upper Hunter” because the
sheep are all walking- out of the
picture; Jan Molvig has an
effective example of one of
those sinister, end-of-the-world
landscapes ; Roy Fluke, though
the picture remains a bit stiff,
like an architect’s blueprint,
offers the interesting informa-
tion that there can be, simul-
taneously, three full-moons
over “Dingo Brush”; and
Irvine Homer’s New England
scenes, if exceedingly shiny,
have moments of primitive
charm.

Seven Painters
The pictures of Audrey C.
Snell, Max Casey, James
Logan Bell, Beverley Stevens,
Daisy Wood, Beatrice Ritchie
and Nora Konig hanging at
the Athenaeum Gallery, Mel-
bourne, all point in very much
the same direction, namely
Nature. At any rate, that
seems to be their intention.
Some are hotter on the scent
than others, but none registers
what could by any stretch of
imagination be described as a
kill.
The “Old-fashioned .Garden”
painted by Beverley Stevens
has atmosphere and feeling,
but Daisy Wood has given her
wildflowers no air to breathe
in. More impressionistic is
Nora Konig, who evidently
uses Meldrum’s method of
measurement to get an effect
that is sometimes pleasing.
Max Casey has sensitivity and
. observation, but is a trifle
short of the technique with
which to express them.

Lawrence Daws
An attractive show of
abstracts by Lawrence M.
Daws, sent back from abroad,
is at Sydney Macquarie
Galleries. “Omphalos 1” is a
fiery piece of red and purple
thrusting inward to a hot
centre which, in spite of its
formidable title, is not unlike
a slighter, abstract version of
Streeton’s “Fire’s On.”
“Omphalos II” moves about in
blue ; “Song of the Edda” is
an intricate construction in
green; and “Precession” (but
surely it should be “Proces-
sion?”) winds across the
canvas in a harlequinade at
once colorful and somewhat
coldly mathematical.

“What Lola Wants”
The screen-version of the
highly successful stage-musical
“Damn Yankees,” this is an
adaptation of the Faust legend
to modern times, but instead
of an aged philosopher selling
his soul to Mephistopheles in
return for youth and love, the
20th-century trader with the
Evil One is a middle-aged
suburban baseball-fan who
hocks his soul for the privilege
of becoming a young hero of
the game. There is also a red-
hot number with red hair and

the subject is handled with

“The Devil’s General”
This German attempt at a
revaluation of Hitler has made
a reappearance at the Australia,
Melbourne, with dubbed Eng-
lish. This certainly helps to
clarify the story of the Luft-
waffe general (Curt Jurgens)
who doesn't see eye-to-eye with
the Fiihrer and is whisked off
by the Gestapo for interroga-
tion.
That Hitler-worship hasn’t
been altogether eliminated
from the German mind is sug-
gested by the fact that Hitler
doesn’t appear except in his
badly painted portraits. A hand
stretches out for a telephone-
receiver and a sharp voice is
heard giving the decisions, but
we nowhere see the whole
sacred person. His last words
are: “So the general is dead
—what a pity. Order a State
funeral immediately.”

COLUMN
Email, Ltd.
'\7’igorous and, at times, seemingly
* indiscriminate expansion-by-absorp-
tion contributed to a more than fivefold
increase in Email’s earnings over the 10
years to December, 1955. However,
when a subsequent weakening in demand
for many electrical lines and changes in
the executive set-up were followed, in
1957, by a fall in earnings, fears were
expressed that the co. might have become
somewhat entangled in its own extensive
net of diverse subsidiary interests.
While the latest accounts from Email
tend to confirm the earlier need to tidy-
up the multi-sided organisation, they do
so by indicating the progress already
made in that direction and, even ignoring
the profit-recovery, suggest a continuing
movement towards a still more effective
utilisation of group resources.
[The Email organisation came into being
in 1934 on the merger of two Sydney-
based concerns, Electricity Meter and
Manufacturing Co. Pty. and New System
Telephones Pty. The parent co. now
heads a big flock of subsidiaries whose
manufacturing-interests range from heavy
electrical equipment (switchgear, generators,
etc.) to ceramic wall-tiles, and cover,
among other things, electric-motors, gas-,
electricity-, water- and parking-meters,
irrigation equipment, domestic and com-
mercial refrigerators, washing-machines,
stoves, space- and water-heaters, plastics,
telephone-registers, air-conditioning units,
shop-fittings and various small domestic-
appliances.
The group is also a substantial share-
holder in, and distributor for, Formica
Plastics Pty., has a shareholding in Amal-
gamated Television Services Pty. (Channel
7, Sydney), which, in turn, has an interest
in Brisbane TV, Ltd., and in conjunction
with Telephone Rentals, Ltd., of London,
supplies telephone, time-control and broad-
casting equipment on a rental basis.
The principal manufacturing centres are
in N.S.W. and Victoria, distribution of
group products, under such well-known
brand-names as Westinghouse, Eicon,
and Airzone, and of a wide variety of
agency-lines being carried out throughout
Australia.]
The possibility of a merger with
Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia),
Ltd., was considered in 1956, but after
lengthy negotiations, the proposal was
dropped, the two boards agreeing merely
to develop further the close liaison
already existing between their cos.
The takeover method of expansion,
financed, mainly, by share-exchanges,
hasn’t provided shareholders with many
opportunities for increasing their invest-
ment (the last cash-issue to members was
in 1948), but there have been other gains,
and while a one-for-four bonus-issue in
1955 heralded the end of a six-year run
of 12j p.c. divs., a liberal one-for-one
handout in the following year made the
8 p.c. div. in 1957 worth 20 p.c. on
pre-bonus holdings. These issues raised
paid capital to £5,585,831, of which
£lOO,OOO carries a cumulative 6 p.c.
A stronger demand for refrigerators
and to a lesser extent, washing-machines,
together with the brisker wholesaling of
TV-receivers, would appear to have had
something to do with last term’s im-
provement in turnover (undisclosed),
and, with economies arising from the
consolidation of various subsidiary acti-
vities, net earnings, as claimed, rose by
£85,841 to £591,396. Before arriving at
the profit-figure the board provided
£130,679 for the “increased cost of plant-
replacement,” and reduced the annual
provision for depreciation by £106,386
to £515,712. As the depreciation provi-
sion doesn’t appear to be under-weight
by the Tax Commissioner’s standards,
the provision for plant-replacement has
been treated as an appropriation in the
following table, to give a net profit of
£722,075, or £216,520 more than the
amount claimed in 1957:

Either way, the addition of a 1 p.c.
bonus to the 8 p.c. div.-rate didn’t strain
anything, and if the large and liquid
working-capital is any guide, shareholders
might reasonably expect to benefit from
any significant increase in earnings in
this term or the next. With capital-profits
of £138,335, a net £346,779 was added
to reserves, but the co.’s reputation for
modesty in matters of profit was in no
way damaged by the non-disclosure of
the tax-provision.
At £716,075, the profit attributable to
ord. shareholders represented 13 p.c. on
ord. capital, as against 9.1 p.c. in 1957
and 10.6 p.c., on the same figure, in 1956.
Another large cut in stocks (down
£565,927) brought the total reduction
over two years to £1,159,888, the conse-
quent increase in cash holdings, etc.,
taking the total against this item to
£1,744,971 (up £509,113). The abundance
of working-capital (up £105,865 at a
conservatively-reckoned £6,840,325) and
the big swag of cash could and, perhaps,
should, encourage the board to pursue
its declared policy of widening the scope
of group operations and seeking fresh
avenues for investment:

Major extensions to the big Orange
(N.S.W.) factory have been completed
in the current term, and additions to
the ceramic-tile plant at Sydney are
nearing completion, as are extensions to
the new commercial-refrigeration plant
near Melbourne. Despite the substantial
cost of these and other projects, deprecia-
tion and the sale of plant and premises
(rendered surplus to requirements by
reorganisation of subsidiary operations)
limited the net increase in fixed - asset
book-values to £69,140. Freehold land
and buildings were written -up by
£1,590,375 in 1956.
At balance-date share-capital was sup-
ported by £4,683,632 of admitted reserves,
the ss. ords. enjoying a net tangible cover
of 9s. 3d. There was, however, another
£1,000,000 to the credit of provisions for
warranty and research and a hefty
£2,252,695 against “taxation, service and
other provisions.”
Bonus-issues can’t be held entirely
responsible for the moderate disclosed
earning-rate on share - capital (share-
premiums accounted for over half of the
1955 and 1956 bonus-additions to capital),
and although earnings have yet to feel
the full benefit of changes in group
organisation, there still seems to be room
for the development of greater earning-
power. Meanwhile, sales have been “sub-
stantially maintained” in the first quarter
of the current term, and, in relation to
current ma'rket-values, the ss. ords.
appear reasonably enough priced at Bs. Id.

Mac. Robertson (Aust.), Ltd.
IN the published accounts of Mac.
Robertson (Australia), Ltd., the
board apparently prefers to smooth-out
some of the bump caused by erratic
movements in raw-material costs, and,
as a result of this quite justifiable
approach, declared net profits tend to
follow a far more even course than do
the annual tax-provisions.
Last term, to December 31, was,
admittedly, a rather bumpy one, and
while the tax-provision was cut by over
50 p.c., net earnings fell by little more
than 10 p.c., to a figure only £lOOO
different from the quite satisfactory
average result for the preceding five
years.
The foundations of the Mac. Robertson
organisation were laid in Melbourne
almost 80 years ago by the late Sir
Macpherson Robertson, and the group has
long occupied a prominent position in
the confectionery trade as the largest,
by far, of the Australian-owned choco-
late-, confectionery- and cocoa-manu-
facturers.
The public first acquired a share-
interest in the business in J 950, when
shareholders in the then newly-formed
Mac. Robertson (Australia) placed
850,000 10s. ords. on the market at 16s.
At the same time the holding-co., which
had previously exchanged 3,400,000 ords.
for the £1,027,203 share-capital of Mac.
Robertson Pty., raised its paid capital
to £2,000,000 by the issue of 300,000
£1 5 p.c. prefs., further issues of ord.
scrip., in exchange for minority interests
in subsidiaries, taking the total on the
share-register to £2,023,882.
The ord. div.-rate slipped from 8 p.c.
to 7 p.c. in 1952, but was restored to
the higher level in 1953 and raised to
9 p.c. in 1956 ; the present 10 p.c. scale
being adopted in 1957 and providing
some compensation for the omission of
the tax-free content which had been a
feature of earlier distributions.
Subsidiaries in the five mainland States
and agents in south-east Asia, Japan,
West Indies, New Zealand and the
Pacific Islands handle the numerous con-
fectionery lines produced at the group’s
large Melbourne factories, while the
wholly-owned Colorprint Pty. turns-out
the necessary cartons and wrappers.
Several years ago Mac. Robertson’s
began work on an experimental cacao-
plantation, of 1250 acres, near Lae, New
Guinea, and last term received the first,
small, shipments of co.-grown beans.
The project is still regarded as a “pilot-
scale venture” but, with the continuing
development of the cacao-bean industry
in New Guinea, it seems probable that
the group will eventually obtain a greater
proportion of its requirements from that
area.
At present, West Africa is the world’s
largest producer of cacao-beans, and
political as well as seasonal uncertainties
suggest a continuation of the violent
fluctuations in market-prices which have
troubled chocolate- and cocoa-manufac-
turers for some years. Over the past 12
months the price of Gold Coast beans
has moved between £440 and £338 a
ton, the price rising as high as £670 a
ton in 1954 before falling to £250 a
ton in 1956.
Minor adjustments to selling - prices
were made by the group early last year,
to counter increases in the cost of beans
towards the end of 1957, the “inade-
quacy” of these adjustments being re-
garded, by the board, as the main cause
of a £200,583 slip in gross trading profit
over the year. In addition, there was a
small drop in the Australian output of
confectionery during the period and a
corresponding slip in group turnover.
The lower turnover brought a small
(£25,754) reduction in selling and admin-
istrative expenses but, at £297,169, pre-
tax trading profit was down by £146,272,
after providing £165,364, or £28,557 less
than in the previous term, for deprecia-
tion and drawing (to an unspecified
extent) on the £40,000 stock-provision
charged against earnings in 1957.
Income from investments and proper-
ties rose by £4960 to £56,010, but it was
the heavily reduced and rather light tax-
provision (down £112,304, at £100,875)
that limited the fall in net earnings to
£29,008:

After breaking out of line in the pre-
vious term, the disclosed earning - rate
ol ord. capital dropped back to 13.7
p.c., as against 15.4 p.c. in 1957 and
13.5, 13.4 and 13.2 p.c. in the three years
back to 1954.
Investment income is derived, mainly,
from sizeable shareholdings in a
number of public and pty. cos. in
which Sir Macpherson Robertson was
interested, shares in other cos. being
valued at £480,316, of which £217,981
is represented by scrip listed on Aus-
tralian ’Changes. Principal sharehold-
ings are in Australian Licorice Pty.
(19.6 p.c. of issued capital), Lifeguard
Milk Products, Ltd. (15.7 p.c.), Life
Savers (Australasia), Ltd. (24.7 p.c.),
Maize Products Pty. (22.9 p.c.), Waxed
Papers Pty. (50 p.c.), Mac. Robertson-
Miller Airlines, Ltd., which also has an
interest in Air Beef, Ltd., (46.1 p.c.) and
Gibson Confectionery Pty. (34.6 p.c.).
Stock on hand climbed by £235,966 last
term but several of the main balance-
sheet movements sprang from a big
reduction in raw - materials bought for
forward delivery (down £461,883). A
corresponding fall in the liability under
forward contracts left the co. to rely
on the overdraft (up £191,176) and cash
holdings (down £200,487) to help cover
the increased stock on hand, an extra
£42,742 in book-debts and the net
£98,929 outlayed on fixed assets.
Although these changes brought a
decline in liquidity, there was no over-
all shortage of working-capital, current
assets (excluding shareholdings) amount-
ing to a comfortable 38s. 9d. at December
31 last for every £ of current liabilities

Freeholds were the subject of a very con-
servative revaluation shortly before the
formation of the hokling-co., subsequent
additions appearing in the accounts at
cost, less depreciation. The majority of
last term’s capital-expenditure went into
a new material-store at the main Mel-
bourne factory and into plant, etc., for
the principal manufacturing- and print-
ing-offshoots.
Heat - wave conditions over southern
Australia affected sales of confectionery
in the first two months of the current
term but cacao-bean prices, rather than
turnover, are likely to remain the main
factor in determining short-term varia-
tions in trading-results, while a solid
financial structure, modern plant and
techniques and well- and favorably-
known products point to encouraging
long-term prospects.
Backed by net tangibles of 18s., the
10s. ords. would return £5 Bs. Id. p.c.
from a 10 p.c. div. at last week’s price
of 18s. 6d.

T)onus- and cash - issues
" announced last week by
R. Fowler, Ltd., will increase
the co.’s ord. capital by 125 p.c.,
but, despite the size of the
issues, there should be little
difficulty in holding to the
indicated 10 p.c. div.-rate.
Ord.-shareholders on the
books on April 25 last will
collect one gift-share for every
two held, the new scrip partici-
pating in a subsequent one-for-
two par offering. The cash-
issue—the first to members for
over 30 years—is equivalent,
in effect, to a three-for-four
issue, and is payable in full by
June 19. -
On completion of the issues,
ord. capital will amount to
£588,825, another £40,000 of
10 p.c. pref. money taking
total paid capital to £628,825.
According to the rather
cautious' profit - estimates
handed-out annually by the
Sydney - registered pottery-
manufacturer, the net earnings
of the co. and its subsidiaries
have risen by at least 50 p.c.
over the past two terms and,
including a £25,000 provision
for kiln - replacement, last
term’s record showing was
sufficient to cover the small
pref.-div. and 17.7 p.c. on the
enlarged ord. capital.
A big programme of plant-
expansion and -modernisation
has contributed to the profit-
gain, and portion of the funds
raised by the new issue will be
used in the further expansion
of production facilities.
Founded in 1837, the Fowler
organisation turns-out stone-
ware drainage- and sewerage-
pipes, sanitaryware (cisterns,
basins, pans, etc.) in vitreous
china and earthernware, insula-
tors, wall - tiles, household-
crockery and other ceramic
products at potteries in Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide and
Brisbane.
Ord. shareholders haven’t
missed a div. since 1933, a
-bonus-issue in 1954 restoring
the ord. capital jettisoned in
the 1934 term. Averaging
7.4 p.c. over the preceding
decade, the div.-rate was
hoisted to 10 p.c. in 1951, with
a p.c. div. coming from
the earnings of each of the
last two terms.
Next month’s interim pay-
out (on pre-bonus scrip only)
will be calculated on the higher
scale, the board indicating a
final div. of not more than
5 p.c. The new cash-issue
shares will rank for half of
the final div., the bonus-shares
ranking equally with the “old”
ords.
The volume of Fowler’s
turnover is determined, to a
large extent, by the level of
activity in the building-trade,
and recent plant-extensions
enabled the group to take full
advantage of a good demand
from that quarter last term
(to September 30), satisfactory
increases being reported in
sales of sanitaryware and
other lines.
Actual turnover and the
tax-provision are both on the
secret-list but, after adjusting
for a tax-overprovision, allow-
ing a little-changed £42,171 for
depreciation and providing
£25,000 (up £10,000) for re-
placement of kilns, net profit,
as written by the board,
advanced by £1440 to £83,659.
Inclusion of the replacement-
provision with earnings
increases the profit-figure to
£108,659 and the gain for the
£11,440:

holdings, as they stood at
balance-date, and exceeding
by £45,776 the amount required
to pay a full year’s 10 p.c. on
the increased ord. capital.
A £31,154 surplus on re-
valuation of lands “formerly
used for the winning of raw-
materials” took the revaluation
reserve to £214,093, the bonus-
issue involving the capitalisa-
tion of £130,850 from this
account.
A new tunnel-kiln for the
burning of Fowlerware at the
Victorian pottery was com-
pleted during the year and,
with the construction of a
second tunnel-kiln at the Mar-
rickville (Sydney) plant early
this year, the group expects to
be in a position to meet “any
increased demands for sanitary-
ware made on it by the build-
ing industry throughout the
Commonwealth.”
Apart from revaluation,

premises added a net £114,007

At September 30 last well
over half of the group assets
were represented by reserves
and, even after allowing for
the bonus- and cash-issues,
visible reserves would still be
£22,578 greater than - ord.
capital. At the same time, con-
sidering the relatively small
amount of outside money in
the business, it would seem
that the board could quite
easily have gone for cheaper,
fixed-interest money, rather
than raise fresh capital.
The group’s immed'tete
prospects and its performance
in recent years warrant a fair
degree of market support for
the scrip, but last week’s price
of 735. 6d., cum div., bonus
and rights, didn’t appear to
leave a great deal of scope for
latecomers. (The books closed
for both issues on Saturday.)
At 735. 6d., the rights would
have a theoretical value of
around 18s. 3d., allowing for
dividend differences, the £1
ords. returning 5.1 p.c. from a
10 p.c. div. at an ex-rights and
ex-div. 38s. 9d.
Monbulk Preserves, Ltd.
A/Tonbulk last year was
churning-out the profits at
the rate of 31 p.c. on paid
capital, and the way things are
shaping it looks like money
for jam.
This prosperous little confi-
turie, which a few years ago
bore the euphonious style of
Camm’s Jams, hasn’t been in
the public eye very long, but
it seems to be a healthy infant.
It is true that reference to
the 1957 memo, of sale —which
offered 200,000 ss. ords. to
the public at ss. 3d. each—
discloses that profits haven’t
been by any means uniform
over the past six or seven
years.
Net earnings adjusted to a
public-company basis with tax
deducted on the present-day
scale show for the five years
prior to listing a sharp dip
followed by a strong upward
trend—£22.49B (1952); £1209
(1953); £5875 (1954); £15,827
(1955); £41,346 (1956).
There is good reason to be-
lieve, however, that this pattern
was influenced by an ab-
normal and non-recurring set
of circumstances.
There was, in 1952, the
sharp recession in the U.K.
market for imported jams fol-
lowing the derationing in the
U.K. of sugar and various
sweet foods. English preserv-
ing companies resumed normal
production compelling Aus-
tralian manufacturers to divert
a larger proportion of their
output to the home market,
where at that time the industry
was enmeshed in punitive
price-controls.
In order to fill the gap left
by the curtailment of export
markets, there had to be a
widening of the range of pro-
ducts and the opening-up of
new outlets locally.
The late D. T. Camm started
out to grow berry-fruit in
1895, and in 1912 he expanded
into the business of jam-
making at Monbulk, Victoria,
marketing under the “Quail”
label. In 1930 D. Camm and
Sons, Pty., was formed to take
over operations, and the well-
known “Monbulk” label made
its appearance.
The firm expanded steadily
until the war, when output was
boosted to meet the require-
ments of the armed forces, and
the immediate post-war years
provided receptive local and
overseas markets which kept
Camm’s production-line busier
than ever.
Part of the demand was
met by the formation in 1946
of D. Camm and Sons (Tas.)
Pty., located in Hobart to
supplement the output of the
headquarters plant with berry-
fruits and apples processed at
the source of supply.
Until 1951 manufacturing in.
Hobart was carried out in
temporary rented premises, but
during that year a new brick
factory, located in the heart of
Hobart Town and built to the
company’s specifications, was
made available by the Depart-
ment of Industrial Develop-
ment on the basis of a ten-
years lease with an option to
purchase for £37,060, cost of
construction. Present - day
value of this building is
approximately £70,000.
Here are profit figures for
the two years since listing:

to strike this result, £46,455

(£14,056) for depreciation.
Notable, too, is a very healthy
surplus of £45,874 after divi-

yet to pass judgment, but 7s.
a ss. share for a yield of 7.1

on the market of today.
Nor has the one-for-five par
issue announced toward the
end of term exhausted the
scrip’s prospects. Export
markets must be viewed with
caution, but Australian sales
remain satisfactory, although
highly competitive, and de-
velopment seems to be at a
brisk rate.
There was a big increase in
the book-value of stocks
during the year, but the
£205,711 rise was mainly due
to the acquisition of a new
subsidiary in Model Preserving

Finances are easier than indi-
cated by a cursory run-down
of the balance-sheet. The
£191,817 of deposits constitutes
a deferred liability, of which
£110,357 is owed to share-
holders themselves, and is re-
payable at the company’s
option . at any time before
1967. Therefore current liabili-
ties are only £456,502 against
current assets of £644,908.
Land and buildings are at
1957 valuation, plus additions
at cost, and plant, etc., is at
1951 valuation or cost, less de-
preciation ; which indicates
that the net tangible cover
shown by book-values at Sep-
tember 30 last, 6s. lOd. for
each ss. of scrip (after comple-
tion of new issue) would be
fair enough.


South Pacific Conference
During the past fortnight
representatives fro m
islands spread over
thousands of square-
miles. have been making their
way to Rabaul where the
fourth South Pacific Con-
ference will be opened today
(April 29).
More than seventy delegates
from 18 Pacific territories
most of them natives of the
islands they represent —will
attend the conference, which
will continue for a fortnight.
The conference is organised by
the South Pacific Commission,
an advisory and consultative
body established 12 years ago
by the countries responsibleffor
the administration of island-
groups in the South Pacific.
The member-countries of
S.P.C. are Australia, New Zea-
land, Britain, France, the
Netherlands and the United
States. Its zone of operations
covers a vast area extending
from the western end of New
Guinea to Pitcairn Island, and
from Australia’s Norfolk
Island, below the Tropic of
Capricorn, to the Marianas.
U.S. Trust Territory just short
of the Tropic of Cancer.
The object of the S.P.C. is
the wellbeing of the people of
the area. It is particularly con-
cerned. with health, economic
and social matters and its Re-
search Council consists of men
who have specialised in various
branches of these subjects and
in their application to the island
territories. On the recom-
mendation of the research
council the Secretary-General
and staff, with headquarters at
Noumea, make what investi-
gations are considered neces-
sary and pass on the results to
all members.
Every three years delegates
selected from the local
inhabitants of the territories
meet in open conference to
discuss their problems. The
delegations may include Euro-
pean advisers, and some do ;
others consist entirely of in-
digenous natives. The first of
these conferences was held at
Nasinu, Fiji, in April, 1950.
Fifteen territories and the
Kingdom of Tonga sent dele-
gations. Noumea was the
scene of the second conference,
in 1953, and the third was held
at Nasinu again, in April-May,
1956. And now Rabaul.
This bringing-together of
people from widely separated
island-groups is something
entirely new in Pacific history.
At no time have all the groups
concerned in S.P.C. been under
one ruler; their languages,
customs and culture are diversi-
fied. There is a vast difference
between the light-skinned,
comparatively cultured people
of Polynesia and the dark,
primitive hillmen of the
interior of New Guinea, who
are still at the Stone Age level.
In between are races at
various degrees of advance-
ment. With the exception
of Tonga, an independent
native kingdom, all the terri-
tories can be loosely de-
scribed as colonies, but the
degree of European domination
and direction varies consider-
ably. Fourteen-thousand of
Tahiti's 36,000 inhabitants are
French, and French Polynesia,
of which Tahiti is the most im-
portant island, has a small local
legislature and is represented in
the French National Assembly.
A similar state of affairs exists
in New Caledonia, where one-
third of the island’s 70.000
people are French including
two-thirds of Noumea's 22,000
inhabitants.
■poi, Britain’s biggest Pacific
-*• colony, has a population
of about 360,000, in which

The Messy-go-Sound
By ROSEMARY DOBSON
THE car turned out of the
gate and on to the high-
way.
“I think we will go
round by the reserve” said
Elizabeth. “It’s something that
you haven’t seen yet, and it’s
really worth seeing. Angus
and I are always so pleased that
we live near it. It’s a lovely
stretch of bush.”
She waited Tor some
response, but none came. Oh,
damn it all, she thought im-
patiently.
“How do you feel?” she
asked aloud, adding implac-
ably, bent on a reply, “Com-
fortable?”
“Yes, thank you very much,”
answered Lucy, her face
averted as she looked dolefully
out of the car window. And
she moved her heavy body
slightly as though to empha-
sise that she had heard the
question.
Elizabeth sighed impatiently
to herself. Were the whole five
weeks to be like this? Was
she never to make any
advance? Lucy had arrived
four days ago and perhaps it
was too early to despair, but
surely by now they should have
achieved some ease in conver-
sation.
Elizabeth stole a glance at
Lucy as she made. the sharp
turn from the highway. She
looked extraordinarily young—
more like 14 instead of 20.
It was not only youthfulness of
appearance, but an apprehen-
sion in her expression. Eliza-
beth did not like ideas to
escape her. She hunted after
them till she could pin them
down and name them. It might
have occcurred to her that
Lucy’s air of apprehension was
that of the quarry scenting the
hunter, but it did not.
Lucy, in fact, was not com-
fortable. She was now always
conscious of her body, heavy
with pregnancy ; and the heat
distressed her. As they drove
along the winding road of the
reserve the early afternoon sun
sprang out from ambushes,
dazzling her eyes. She held her
handkerchief in her hand, but
was afraid that if she were to
lift it to her forehead Eliza-
beth would notice. She wished
that the journey would come
to an end.
Elizabeth drove slowly. “I
suppose you know all these
wildflowers” she said, “pro-
bably much better than I do.
Look at the pink wax-flower.
Isn't it lovely?”
And moved by an impulse
she stopped the car, jumped
out, picked a small spray, and
returning gave it to Lucy.
“Seven flowers,” she said.
“A little constellation. They
might be the Pleiades, star-
shaped like that.”
“Can I wish on them,
Mummy?” asked Elizabeth’s
small daughter Marjorie, from
the back seat.
“She likes to wish on the
first star of the evening,” ex-
plained Elizabeth. “Sometimes
I know what she wishes, and
sometimes I don’t.”
Lucy touched one of the
flowers with the tip of her
finger. If only it will be all
right, she wished. Then she
turned and gravely handed the
spray to Marjorie.
“I wish there will be a
merry-go-round.”
“1 truly think there will be,”
said Elizabeth.
They drove on. The road
seemed to press apart on either
side a springing growth of
trees and shrubs. In the warm
autumn sunlight the leaves
glittered brilliantly, silver and
grey-green, olive and wine-red.
Even the particles of dust
thrown up by the wheels of the
car hung in the air like fine
silver. Outcrops of sandstone
shone warmly, and here and
there a freshet of water falling
over rocks dazzled their eyes.
The hills turned over and over,
folding and unfolding, and
between them every now and
then there was a wink of sun-
light on the distant river.
“It is beautiful,” said Lucy.
It was almost the first remark
she had volunteered in the four
days, and Elizabeth was beyond
proportion grateful for her
appreciation.
Tt was an ugly sight which
met them as they turned
out of an S-shaped bend in
the load.
The accident could not long
have happened. Both cars
seemed severely smashed, glass
was scattered over the roadway,
and a dazed man and a woman
were still extricating them-
selves from the wreckage while
two other figures crouched
over a woman lying slack in
the dust.
Elizabeth pulled-up sharply,
turning the nose of the car into
the side of the road.
“Don’t look,” she com-
manded quickly. “Turn the
other way and talk to
Marjorie.”
She feared there would be
fainting or hysterics and hoped
that by acting quickly herself
she would stifle any such
tendencies in Lucy. She
slammed the door to and ran
along the road.
Only one man of the group
appeared sufficiently con-
trolled to help her. The women
sat down at the side of the
road crying noisily, and
another man walked round and
round the two cars nursing an
arm and swearing obscenely.
Between them Elizabeth and
the .first man did what they
could to ease the pain
of the woman whose
injuries were only too
obviously severe. It was not
until some time afterwards,
when Lucy appeared beside
her. that Elizabeth looked up.
“There was a house about a
mile back,” said Lucy. “1 took
the car and asked them to ring


for a doctor and an ambulance.
They should be here in a
moment.”
And with a good sense and
an absence of morbid curiosity
for which Elizabeth blessed
her, she returned immediately
to the car.
When Elizabeth joined them
twenty minutes later she found
Lucy and Marjorie conversing
with great animation. Lucy
fell silent again as they started
off and drove past the
shattered cars where a doctor
and an ambulance-man were
now taking charge.
“That was splendid of you,
Lucy,” said Elizabeth, “I was
afraid you’d”—and then, not
being quick enough to end her
sentence differently she left it
disastrously, hanging in the
air. Silence emphasised her
dismay.
Lucy knew very well what
she had been going to say.
Elizabeth, so frighteningly
capable herself, had been
afraid that she would be
hysterical. Well, she was learn-
ing to control herself quite a
lot. And in spite of the heat
and the unpleasant tremors of
fear that still lingered she ffelt
pleased.
“Look here,” said Elizabeth.
“I don’t think we’ll go on to
the Andrews. Let’s go home.
I don’t think that could have
been too good for you to
witness in your condition, and
I’m terribly sorry it all hap-
pened.”
“No,” replied Lucy quickly ;
“lets go on. I’m quite all right
■—and we mustn’t disappoint
Marjorie.” And indeed, this
new-found control in the midst
of her fear and homesickness
elated her. She added, “I can
rest later.”
HEhe Andrews were giving a
■*- children’s party in aid of
a Church orphanage. Invita-
tions had been sent out and
an entrance-fee was charged.
Balloons hung from the
trees, there was a Punch-and-
Judy show and, sure enough,
a merry-go-round.
“Are you sure you’re all
right?” asked Elizabeth as
they got out of the car, and
then, feeling that Lucy was
resenting her solicitude, she
went on hurriedly, “I can’t
think why they don’t make
this sort of thing open to who-
ever wants to come in. I
suppose they are afraid they
might get some common
children in by mistake.”
That sounded scathing and
unjust, she reflected, but she
remembered Stella Andrews as
the snob she had been at school.
Her heart sank as they went
through the gate: she could see
at a glance several of her
acquaintances among the
groups of parents in the garden.
Now the embarrassment that
she had been dreading for the
past week would certainly
begin. Since Lucy had arrived
they had hardly left the house
and certainly there had been no
need for introductions. Stella
Andrews came over to them.
“How are you, Elizabeth?
And this is Marjorie? Would
you like one of these
balloons?” She separated one
from a number she held in
her hand and gave it to her.
Marjorie clasped it happily.
“Stella, may I introduce
Lucy West? She’s Tom West’s
wife, and she is staying with
us.”
And Elizabeth went on
hurriedly, staving off Stella’s
amused curiosity.
“Could we find somewhere
to sit down, please?”
It was ridiculous to become
flustered about it, but really
the position was absurd. A
stepmother seven years
younger than onself who
looked at least twelve years
younger! And people had
gossiped so much about
Angus’s father’s second
marriage. It was just as well
that it had taken place quietly
at Warialda where Tom lived.
But Elizabeth still felt
resentful of the curiosity
“Some child Tom married
practically out of a bush
school”—so she had overheard
someone explaining. Now
that Lucy was in Sydney and
staying with them the discrep-
ancy was brought home still
more forcibly. Thank good-
ness, Elizabeth had consoled
herself in the first few hours
after Lucy’s arrival; she is
quiet, and not arch and
kittenish. That she felt she
could hardly have borne.
With relief she caught sight
of her friend Catherine Davies
sitting calmly under a tree.
With her there was no need of
explanations.
“Catherine,” she said as they
joined her, “here’s Lucy.
Will you see that she rests?
Lucy, do stay with Catherine.
I’ll get you both some tea.”
Taking Marjorie by the
hand she left them abruptly.
/"''atherine, tranquil and con-
siderate, sensed Lucy’s
fatigue and unease and after
making one or two remarks
which required no answer said
that the sun made her feel
lazy and shut her eyes. Lucy
at once relaxed her defences
and began to be preoccupied
with her fears and anxieties.
She longed not for her hus-
band in this first separation
from him, but for her child-
hood home. There, she felt,
she would be at ease, and able
to face her greatest fear calmly.
It was, in fact, her mother
she wanted. And here was
Elizabeth with three cups of
tea on a tray.
“Marjorie is sitting beside
James at the tea-table,
Catherine,” she said, “and I
left them there because they
are quite happy. There’s a vast
array of cakes and things, but
Marjorie is eating her straw,
and James seems to be count-
ing hundreds - and - thousands
They are quite speechless.”
They drank their tea sitting
in a row on the seat, Lucy
in the middle. Before them
on the lawns children peeped
excitedly or ran about aim-
lessly. Attendant a dm Its
watched them with love and
pride.
“I say,” remarked Catherine;
“there’s a kind of bloom about
mothers when you see them
in a mass like this, isn’t there?
They all look beautiful. Per-
haps we do, too.”
“I doubt it,” replied Eliza-
beth, “for my part.” And she
told Catherine briefly of the
accident, adding. “Lucy was
marvellous.”
“I expect you were too,”
said Catherine, and Lucy
assented in a belated murmur.
“I don’t know how well you
know Elizabeth yet, Lucy, but
she can always be relied upon
to act quickly and to do the
right thing. She’s never
frightened by anything.”
“But I am,” said Elizabeth,
leaning across Lucy. “There
have been times in my life —I
was terrified when Marjorie
was born. I thought I’d never
live through it. It was dread-
ful.”
And for the second time that
afternoon she bitterly regretted
her words.
There it was, thought Lucy.
It was out in the air at last,
and now she had her oppor-
tunity to ask. For the thought
of labor and the act of giving
birth had, for nearly eight
months, filled her with a
dread she could not dispel. She
had tried once to express her
fear in a letter to her mother,
but in the end she had
destroyed it, thereby sparing
her mother much anguish.
Mrs. Paton loved her
daughter deeply, but with a
nervous reticence that forbade
any real intimacy of conver-
sation. She approved Lucy’s
marriage in spite of the dis-
crepancy in ages because she
knew that Tom West’s steadi-
ness would shelter her
daughter, and that his wealth
would give her the security
that she herself had longed for
but had never known. So she
had given Lucy her blessing,
but had felt quite unable to
discuss the physical aspect of
marriage. Babies? She couldn’t
have discussed the prospect of
babies with Lucy for anything.
Now Lucy had only to ask
these two young women lightly
and offhandedly and they, out
of their experience, could help
her. But the dread loomed
again, and the words died
before they were uttered. Per-
haps there will be another
opportunity, she thought. Per-
haps later on I’ll get to know
Elizabeth quite well, and then
it will be easier.
At this moment she was
aware of another young woman
standing in front of them.
“Hullo, Elizabeth, Catherine,”
she was saying. “Elizabeth, do
introduce me. I hear this is
your stepmother.”
■Clizabeth stood up. “Yes,”
■*-' she replied abruptly, “it’s
Lucy West. Lucy, this is
Margaret Manning.”
“How do you feel about
having two bouncing step-
children like Elizabeth and
Angus? Will you boss them
round? And you’re Marjorie’s
grandmother? Crazy, isn’t it?
How’s Tom? He and my
father were great friends.”
Even Catherine, glancing
from Margaret to Lucy, was
perturbed by the crassness of
the questions. Lucy knew that
she and Elizabeth, both
acutely embarrassed, were try-
ing to find some way to
terminate the conversation
when, mercifully, Marjorie
and James appeared.
“Mummy,” said Marjorie,
“can we go on the merry-go-
round?”
Lucy rose awkwardly to her
feet.
“I’d like to take them, could
I?”
“I’ll come with you,” said
Catherine.
“Excuse me,” said Elizabeth
to Margaret Manning. “I
must find Stella.”
The merry-go-round, hired
for the occasion, was set up
under a tall plane-tree. There
was a sprinkle of light and
shade and a sprinkle of hurdy-
gurdy music, at once tawdry
and appealing. Round and
round went the small girls and
the small boys, round and
round, slower and slower, and
then the music stopped and
the merry-go-round was still.
Lucy thought of the circus


that had come to the country
town where she had gone to
school and, remembering her
childish joy, longed to recap-
ture it. Beside her Marjorie
hopped from one foot to the
other so Lucy had hopped
waiting for her turn. Her
mother had bought her a ticket.
Now she bought tickets for
Marjorie and James and, with
Catherine, moved forward to
put the children aboard.
Suddenly Catherine, after a
quick consultation with James,
called to Lucy: “He wants to
be sick. Can you manage?
I'll have to go.” And they
disappeared.
Now Marjorie, already
astride a horse, became
alarmed. Unaccompanied, she
was momentarily lost. The
music sprinkled down through
the sunlight. Marjorie's face
puckered and, unthinking, act-
ing on an impulse that was
half-pity and half-eagnerness,
Lucy climbed up to join her.
At once the merry-go-round
began to revolve. Lucy
stood, steadying Marjorie on
her horse and wedging herself
against a wooden upright. As
through a long tunnel she saw
herself as a child again and
identified herself with that
child’s unquestioning happi-
ness.
The music was cheaply,
sadly gay. The children
laughed and called, Lucy
smiled and the rri'erry-go-round
spun faster and faster. Suddenly
the effort of holding Marjorie
steady gave her a slight twinge
of pain in her back and with
a jolting return to adulthood
she thought, “I should never
have got on.”
But still the merry-go-
round accelerated. She saw,
scarcely distinguishable in a
brilliant wheel of color, people,
grass, trees, people, grass,
trees. Shutting her eyes she
concentrated on darkness in an
effort to stifle the nausea and
faintness within her. At last
she heard the music diminish-
ing, felt the slowing revolu-
tions and, as the merry-go-
round faltered to a stop,
managed with infinite care the
descent.
Elizabeth, anxious and
alarmed, had arrived in time
to see the last few revolutions
of the merry-go-round. With
a forbearance unusual to her
she asked no questions but took
Lucy’s arm and led her and
Marjorie at once to the car.
She was stricken by Lucy’s
evident weakness and blamed
herself for not having watched
her, for not having gone
straight home after the acci-
dent in the reserve.
She drove quickly, but to
Lucy the journey seemed end-
less. Once again she felt the
sharp, sudden, downward
ache in her back. And with
a dreadful flash of intuition
she thought, “It can’t be —
not the baby!” It was five
weeks too soon, it couldn’t be.
And she waited, watching the
speedometer and bracing her
back against the seat of the
car.
/"\utwardly calm, Elizabeth
helped her to her bedroom.
She removed Lucy’s shoes,
assisted her into bed, and with
the ordered efficiency of the
naturally-competent rang the
doctor, fetched a hot-water-
bottle, and made tea. All the
time in her mind she was add-
ing and subtracting days and
hours and recalling the onset
of her own confinement.
“And what has our species evolved to? Yuman robots—
industrialised ants —peas in a pod!”
It was Lucy who finally put
into words the thought that
was so alarming them both.
From the bed she looked up
at Elizabeth, her face pallid
and unhappy. “I’m awfully
sorry, Elizabeth, but I’m afraid.
Can you tell me —is it the baby
coming? It’s so early.”
“I know,” said Elizabeth.
“We’ll have to see what the
doctor says.”
Lucy despaired. Now there
would never be time to ask. If
it was all going to be as dread-
ful as she feared how would
she know whether something
was very wrong—or not? And
for the first time she thought of
the baby, not as part of the
fear, but as a being who might
live, or irretrievably, unbear-
ably, die.
When they arrived at the
hospital Lucy was taken at
once to the labor ward. At
the desk Elizabeth, with Angus
beside her, gave the necessary
details.
“Yes, that's about all,” said
the nurse. “You’re Mrs. West's
sister, I take it.”
“Oh no,” said Elizabeth,
“I’m her step-daughter.”
“I beg your pardon •”
“Don’t you see? She’s my
husband’s father’s wife.”
“Ah, yes.” The nurse
adjusted her mind to this in-
formation. “Well,” she said
cosily, “isn’t that nice! It’s not
everyone who has a grown-up
daughter on hand at her first
confinement. Will you and
your husband wait here? You
may be here a good while. Poor
little thing, she looked worried,
didn’t she?”
“Poor thing, poor thing,”
repeated Elizabeth after the
nurse had gone. “If only I’d
been nice to her. I’ve resented
her all the time she’s been with
us, and now I’ve let this
happen.”
“You really shouldn’t blame
yourself, Liz,” said Angus,
holding out to her a lighted
cigarette. “I know the accident
was probably rather a shock,
but who’d have thought she'd
have gone jumping on to a
merry-go-round.”
“I know, I know. But if
we’d gone home as we should
have done it might have been
all right. She was terrified on
the way here, you know, and
I really think she’s been
terrified for months. Tom
wouldn’t have been able to
understand that, and she’d no
one else to talk to, stuck away
up there.”
“But how were you to know
she was terrified? She just
seemed reserved to me. I don’t
think she wanted to get to
know us. Don’t go persecuting
yourself.”
“I must tell you Angus. I
loathed the thought of having
to tell everyone she was my
stepmother. I thought of every-
one making stupid facetious
remarks. The trouble is I’ve
no sense of humor at all. What
time is it now?”
“Ten o’clock.”
At half-past eleven Lucy’s
baby was born. In her
imagination great waves of
pain had left her stranded on
some dark, barren stretch of
shore to which she clung resign-
ing life, hope, memory.
“Here’s your son, Mrs.
West,” said the sister. Lucy
opened her eyes. The whole
world turned over and the
shore was bright with warmth
and light. She saw a face
older and wiser than any she
had ever seen. It was the first
child in the world, im-
measurably old, immeasureably
wise. Then feebly, flickeringly
he opened first his eyes, and
then his, mouth. His hands
fluttered to the light. He began
to cry.
“He’s very little but he’ll be
all right.” The sister took up
the baby. “Your stepdaughter
is here, Mrs. West.”
Elizabeth stood beside the
bed.
“It’s all right,” said Lucy.
“Don’t look so worried, Eliza-
beth. Everything’s all right.”
“Lucy, I managed everything
so badly. It was all my fault —■
the accident—everything.”
“It wasn’t the accident,” said
Lucy. “It wasn’t your fault.
Don’t you see? It was the
merry-go-round. I wanted to
go back and that was wrong.
I shouldn’t have minded going
forward. I’m sorry, I don’t
suppose I’m making sense. It
was all to do with being
afraid, and that was so unneces-
sary. Do you understand?”
And she added, “Where’s Mar-
jorie? You know, / got my
wish too.”

GREASY-WOOL FUTURES
[Part 3]
By CLIVE HALL
"Defore giving examples of
actual transactions on a
greasy-wool futures market I
feel I should stress to wool-
growers that a futures market
is a cash market. Each day
“margins” are paid into the
market by floor-members on
behalf of those of their clients
against whom the market is
moving.
This means to say that on a
rising market they will pay
into the clearing-house daily
sums of money representing
the rise in the market to a
farthing per lb. on behalf of
those of their clients who have
sold contracts and will
obviously have to buy them
back at a price higher than at
which they sold. (In a falling
market the opposite applies.)
By so doing, this enables the
client who bought futures to
“close out” his transaction at
any time and receive his
money in cash. The floor-
member in his turn will call
for margins from his clients
and will wish to have it
promptly— i.e., the same day.
Should it not be received the
same day, as I understand the
position, the floor-member is
within his rights to close out
the contracts and take what-
ever action is necessary to get
the money.
In Australia today the col-
lection of margin is overcome
on the London market by
getting the country client to
appoint his bank or his wool-
selling broker as his agent to
pay money as required by the
market movements.
Now, normally wool and
futures markets move together:
that is, when wool is high,
futures are high, and vice versa.
However, there will be occa-
sions caused by one of a
number of reasons where either
futures are dear in relation to
wool or cheap in relation to
wool. Such occasions are
normally short-lived, but as I
have stressed before the wool-
grower is well advised to con-
sult a futures-broker before
attempting to operate to avoid
such pitfalls.
A well known maxim, which
is most applicable to the
futures and wool markets, is to
buy what is cheap and sell
what is dear. The woolgrower
has always got a stock of wool
that is the equivalent of a
purchase, and it is in his interest
to sell futures as an insurance
at the dearest possible price
relative to that wool.
My first example will, I
hope, illustrate a normal trans-
action on a greasy-wool futures
market in Australian currency,
with wool and futures follow-
ing their usual pattern ; and in
the second example I will
endeavor to show what
happens when the woolgrower
sells futures when they are
cheap, at the same time draw-
ing attention to the fact that
it is always advisable for the
grower to “hedge” in a quoted
month on a futures market
four to eight weeks after his
clip is due to come to auction.
This is to protect himself, in
case of delays, either in transit
or hold-up in sales, etc.
Example No. 1: A wool-
grower with a clip of 35 bales
of Merino wool, averaging
3001 b. per bale greasy, shears
in September, but his clip does
not come up for auction until
December. However, at the
time of shearing, similar wool
is selling for an average price
of 72d. per lb. greasy, and he
finds that the futures market
for January is quoted at 120 d.
per lb. clean, which price he
assesses would give him the
same return as if he were sell-
ing his clip immediately (his
clip yielding approximately 60
per cent, clean wool).
He therefore sells two
January contracts at 120 d. per
lb. clean — i.e., he promises to
deliver on to the futures market
the greasy equivalent of 60001 b.
clean weight of 64’s average-
style wool, for which he will
receive 120 d. per lb. clean, i.e.,
£3OOO. He is now in the posi-
tion where he has a stock of
wool which is currently valued
at £3150, and he has made a
sale of futures to the value
of £3OOO, from which it can
be seen that he has an almost
complete insurance for the
value of his clip.
In December his wool is
sold, but in the meantime
values for wool have fallen by
10 per cent., which will show
him a loss of some £3OO on his
clip, but he is now able to buy
back his futures contracts for
January at 108 d. per lb.,
futures having declined with
wool, which will give him a
profit of 12d. per lb. on each
contract, or a gross profit on
his futures deal of £3OO, which
he uses to offset the loss on his
jvool.
The final result would be as
follows:
Sale of Wool Clip
Value of clip in
September—
-35 bales (3001 b. per bale)
@ 72 pence per lb.,
35 x 300 x 72 ..=£3150 0 0
Result of Sales in
December —
Price realised, 65 pence
per lb., 35 x 300 x 65 = £2843 15 0
Gross loss on sale owing
to fall between Sep-
tember and December £306 5 0
Result of Futures Transactions
Sale in September of two
January contracts —
Each 30001 b. @ 120
pence per lb =£3ooo 0 0
Purchase of two January
contracts -
Bought, back in Decem-
ber when’ clip is sold
to liquidate the above
sale —bought back at
108 pence per lb.,
2 x 3900 x 108 .. =£2700 0 0
Gross profit on futures
transaction .. .. £3OO 0 0
Gross retuni from wool
and futures .. .. £3143 15 0
From the above figures it can
be seen that his gross income
is extremely close to the figure
for which he budgeted.
Example No. 2 : Using the
same grower’s figures but wiih
futures values at only 116 d.
per lb: We will then have the
position of the grower having
wool to the value of £3150 and
having sold futures against
that to the value of £2900.
Admittedly, he is protected
against a major fall, but in a
small decline he could be
affected by his adverse futures
trading to the extent of £lOO
or more.
We will assume the market
rose from 116 d. to 120 d., in
which case he would have to
put up . margin, and then it
declined to 109 d. on the date
he sold his clip. Whilst it was
declining and when the price
of futures returned to 116 d.
he would be able to receive
back from his broker the
margin which he had put up
when it was 120 d., but at ail
times he must maintain his
original deposit in the market
until he “closes out,” or
terminates, the contract.
Result of Futures Transactions
Sale in September of two
January contracts—
Each 30001 b @ llOd.
per lb =£2900 0 0
Futures market rises
to 120 d. per lb. per
contract — i.e., 4 pence
per lb. on 60001 b.
clean =£3ooo 0 0
! Margin requirements to
cover loss if closed-
out at this point .. =£loo 0 0
As market falls back
to 116 pence this
amount is refunded.
Purchase of two January
contracts —
Bought hack in Decem-
ber when clip is sold
to liquidate above sale—
Bought back @ 109
pence per lb.—
2 x 3000 x 109 ..=£2725 0 O
Gross profit on futures

Gross return from sale
of wool .. .. .. £2843 15 0
Final income .. £3OlB 15 0
On the London market
interest is paid on deposits held
against contracts, but not on
margin moneys.
Listed here are a few futures
trading terms with which 1
think growers should be
familiar:
BEAR and BEARISH: A bear is
one who believes in lower prices.
To “bear the market” is to press
sales in a concentrated manner. An
item of news may be considered
bearish if it is expected to precipi-
tate sales.
BULL and BULLISH: A bull is
one who believes in higher prices.
To “bull the market” ts to buy
contracts steadily and vigorously.
A news-item or repo.t may be con-
sidered bullish it if portends higher
prices.
CALL: A designated buying and
selling period resemoiing an auction
conducted three times a day on
London in order to establish official
maiket quotations, it is important
to note that a call period lasts
only a short time (about 10
minutes) and trading is confined to
one delivery-monm a time during
the call.
CLEARING-HOUSE: The cen-
tral agency autiior.sed by the
London Wool Terminal Market
Association which guarantees all
contracts and th.ough which all
transactions of members of the
Lxchange are clea.ea and financial
settlements effected daily.
DEPOSIT: The amount deposited
by a client with his broxer to pro-
tect the broker against losses on
contracts for his account.
DIFFERENTIALs: T his nor-
mally means the premium or dis-
count applicable to me qualities of
lops finer or coarser than 64’s B
which are deliverable on the London
market. Such differentials are fixed
at the first of each month.
LONG: One is sa.d to be “long”
on the Futures Market if one buys
contracts as an opening transaction
in anticipation of a rise.
MARGIN: A margin js a request
to deposit further money to offset
losses caused by adverse market
fluctuations.
POINT: The minimum unit in
which changes in futures prices may
be expressed—that is, one farthing
per lb. on London.
ROUND TURN: A purchase
and its liquidating sale, or a sale
and its liquidating purchase.
SHORT: The term used to
describe one who sells futures con-
tracts as an opening transaction in
anticipation of a fall.
SPOT PRICE: The price at which
physical sales of the commodity
are actually taking place.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Sydney Horses
The A.J.C.’s Anzac Day
meeting attracted 27,000, pro-
ceeds to benefit ex-service
organisations. Sharp showers
after racing began made the
going soft conditions in
which apprentice - allowances
are taken advantage of, and
the younger lads duly won the
first six of the seven events.
The solitary exception was G.
Podmore’s win on Grove Hall
in the concluding Welter. It
was Grove Hall’s fourth win,
but was his first in open
company.
• • • •
Claiming a 71b. allowance,
C. Hunt rode Woolsack par-
ticularly well for his win in
the Coral Sea Handicap. In
Love, winner at his two prior
outings, both on wet tracks,
had too much weight this
time. Woolsack is to be
entered for major sprints at
the coming Brisbane winter
meetings.
Morning Star, who had the
best form of the 24 starters in
the A.J.C.’s First Two-year-old
Stakes (a Graduation event),
beat stablemate Count Rego
by half-a-head, with the speedy
pacemaker Inquisitive a close
third. The result seemed
another strong case for
bracketing stablemates on the
tote. In early course-betting
Count Rego was favorite. He
eased in the face of strong
support for Morning Star, who
firmed from 9 to 2 to 7 to 4.
On form the winner was
entitled to be favorite.
Prince Delville’s colors were
carried to victory by Polo
Prince in the Second Somme
Two-year-old Stakes. The
gelding—raced by Mrs. J. G.
Barnes and W. J. Bradshaw—
is by imported Osborne II
from Ducal Gem by Le Grand
Due (Fr.) from Emerald by
Constant Son (imp.). Ducal
Gem has thrown a number of
winners; Osborne II won 13
races in England at from six
furlongs to 2{ miles, and Polo
Prince might be a good one.
At his prior start at Rand-
wick he had been beaten
narrowly by Wolarma.
Midget apprentice A.
Taylor, claiming 61b., showed
good judgment in keeping
Novice winner Lady Signal
away from the heavier going
alongside the rails. E. D. Law-
son trains Lady Signal for a
partnership of four. Runner-
up Careless Lass was ridden by
apprentice R. Hutt, and
another apprentice, Keith
Smith, was on minor place-
getter Cherry. Lady Signal
is by Brueghel (It.) from Isigny
by Valognes (imp.).

not previously scored at
A.J.C. headquarters, but he
had won at Newcastle and
Canterbury. Most thought a
mile would be a trifle too short
for the son of Talking, in the
Encourage, but he was at home
on the soft track and won with
something to spare, well
handled by Keith Smith.
Leukos came on the scene
when the race was almost over ;
he has been disappointing at
recent starts. The favorite,
Mighty Missel, was a mighty
flop. Though capably enough
handled by Fred Hood, he may
have gone better for N. Sell-
wood, who had a fall in the
opening race, suffering a
broken collarbone.
• • • •
Trainer Gordon Brown’s
luck is out with his middle-
distance galloper Turkestan,
who has finished second at his
last three starts, twice to Flash
Gem, and at Randwick on
Saturday to Autumn Amber, to
whom he had to concede 231 b.
That made the difference be-
tween success and defeat. The
winner is by Genetout (Fr.),
whose progeny do well as a
rule when the going is soft.
Royal Jester was a promising
third.
Trainer T. J. Smith arranged
a gallop by champion Tulloch
and Tory Victory (another of
his team) at the Randwick
meeting. They ran three fur-
longs in an easy 38sec. while
a shower was falling. Tulloch
(R. Selkrig) just won the trial,
but was not ridden along. His
trainer was pleased with the
effort, and Tulloch will resume
racing at the Brisbane winter
fixtures.

The Sydney Turf Club has
dropped its all-tote meetings
after a trial of some weeks.
Had all Sydney racing been
conducted on trial as all-tote
fixtures the scheme would have
had a better chance, but all-
tote mid-week, and then back
to bookmakers and tote on
Saturdays foredoomed it.
Randwick trainer M. Mc-
Carten, who has enjoyed much
success with gallopers of New
Zealand ownership and breed-
ing, will shortly take over the
preparation of crack three-
year-old Up and Coming, one
of the best of the younger
horses to come to Australia in
recent years. Raced by trotting
owner-breeder N. Simpson,
who bred him, the gelding is
by Resurgent (imp.) from Cash
and Carry, an unraced mare,
by Paper Money (imp.) from
Gold Sand by Psychology
(imp.). Gold Sand won 10
races up to one mile and is
related to Courtship, a
brilliant filly whose five suc-
cessive wins at two-years in-
cluded the A.J.C. December
Stakes at Randwick. This
season Up and Coming has
won the Avondale, Great
Northern and Wellington
Guineas, the N.Z. Derby and
the Great Northern St. Leger.
A sound stayer, he can mix
his distances. Last month he
ran second to Yahabeebe in the
seven-furlongs Challenge
Stakes in 1.224, a New Zea-
land record. Australia's best
(1.22) was made in 1942 by
Freckles.
Most of the latest Canter-
bury Park mid-week winners
showed quick form-improve-
ment which tricked the
majority of punters. Had book-
makers been operating they
would have copped the lot!
This all-tote fixture was one of
the best held —and now they're
out. Tote - turnover was
£150,019 10s.
Mainbrace—champion of his
time in New Zealand ; winner
of 23 races,, 17 of them in suc-
cession, and of £28,985 in
stakes—sired Mainbridge, sty-
lish winner of the Canterbury
First Maiden. Bred in New
Zealand, the three-year-old
cost a modest 325gns. as a
yearling; the first foal of
Empire Princess by Foxbridge
(imp.) from Te Awe Awe by
Lord Quex (imp.). Te Awe
Awe won several races, in-
cluding the Marlborough (N.Z.)
Cup.

Dipso, rank outsider but all-
the-way winner of the Canter-
bury Wednesday Handicap,
was thought by the stable and
regulars at that track in the
early mornings to have had an
excellent show in the Welter
at the same course four days
earlier. He had shown trainer
Herb McNamara an excellent
track-trial, and was backed in
the Welter from 14’s to B’s, but
finished eighth of 14 starters.
Under the lighter scale of
weights last Wednesday Dipso
carried only 7.4, and was
ridden capably by stable-
apprentice K. Parkinson. The
win-div. worked out at 55 to 1.

Melbourne Notes
With the approach of the
jumping-season the corres-
pondence-columns of news-
papers will be the sounding-
board for the annual con-
troversy —whether or not cross-
country racing is cruel. Neither
the' hurdles nor the fences at
any Melbourne course are fear-
some enough to be a major
hazard to horse or rider —and
even races on the flat occasion
their share of serious falls. On
the other hand, jumping-races
make a wonderful spectacle. It
is this writer’s view that Mel-
bourne racing will be the
poorer if the opponents of
jumping-events ever succeed in
having them abolished.
On that subject, it’s good
news that Pedro’s Pride is back
in training. The big daughter
of Don Pedro is the finest
jumping - mare in living
memory. She will be burdened
with enormous weights, but if
her suspect leg stands-up to
racing she will add color to the
season.
• • • •
With no racing in Melbourne
last Saturday (Anzac Day) a
party of Melbourne book-
makers flew to Sydney to try
their luck as punters. At time
of writing they had not
returned —if that’s significant.
They may have suffered injury
trying to remember to urge the
favorite on instead of back.
Over the past couple of
years several Melbourne
trainers have made overtures
to Deniliquin apprentice Roy
Higgins to transfer his inden-
tures, but the lad, who has been
outstandingly successful in the
Riverina, has chosen to serve
out his time with his present
master, Jim Watters. He will
become a fully-fledged jockey
in June, and will settle in Mel-
bourne if retained as No. 1
rider by a prominent stable.
On what he has shown of his
skill in Melbourne, he should
not lack offers. He has rarely
made an unsuccessful visit to
the city.
• • • •
News that Tulloch had a
trial gallop at Randwick
created tremendous interest in
Melbourne racing-circles.
Champion as he was in three
States, Tulloch ran his best
races in the southern capital.
His record-breaking Caulfield
Cup win was an unforgettable
performance, and Melbourne
racegoers would love to see the
champion repeat the dose in
this year’s Melbourne Cup.
Incidentally, Tommy Smith
once remarked that his charges
looked better and generally
raced better in Melbourne.
Possibly the milder climate is
the reason. Conversely, Mel-
bourne horses rarely show their
best in Sydney. Lord, for
example, at this year’s A.J.C.
autumn carnival was nowhere
near the galloper he had
proved himself at home. Caul-
field Cup and V.R.C. Derby
winner Sir Blink is another who
couldn’t show his best form in
Sydney.

The Trots
Quick thinking on the part
of driver Merv Adams won
the £lOOO Harold Park Invi-
tation (11| furlongs) for
champion mare Sibelia last
Friday night, downing Fettle
and First Kiss. Fettle (winner
of the Lord Mayor’s Cup)
and Sibelia started from
12yds. behind. With a lap
and a half to go Fettle and
Field Dixie locked wheels, and
Adams at once dashed Sibelia
around into second place be-
hind pacemaker First Kiss.
First Kiss was still first into
the straight from Sibelia and
Fettle, but Sibelia easily did
best in the run to the judge to
win by two-and-a-half lengths.
Fettle hung on to dead-heat
with the tiring First Kiss.
Sibelia has now won 19
races at the Park, one more
than any other pacer since
night trotting was introduced in
1949. She paced at a 2. 5 i

gait, only f sec. outside her

Central North won the Cald-
well Cup for 1959 when it de-
feated Central West 8-6 in
the final of the N.S.W. Rugby
Union country carnival at
Chatswood Oval, Sydney.
Central West led 6-0 at half-
time. Central North entered
the carnival in 1957, and it
was its first win of the Cup.
Central North, capably led
all through by Wallaby lock-
forward Peter Fenwicke, had
the harder path to the final,
having to defeat two of the
carnival’s strongest sides,
Riverina and the A.C.T. How-
ever, Central West, whose two
earlier wins had been over
New England and Hawkesbury
Agricultural College, also did
well to reach the final, as it
had more than its quota of
injuries. Fenwicke was selected
later to lead Country 1 against
City I on May 9.
Last year’s Caldwell Cup
winners, Newcastle, did not
compete in this year’s carni-
val. On Sunday a strong

In Saturday’s round of
Sydney Rugby Union, Uni-

Main surprise of the week-

half-time and later leading 4-0.
In the previous round Glades-

“L.G.G.”: An Australian
Soccer club-record crowd of
11,080 saw Prague outclass
Auburn 7-0 in the final of the
Ampol Cup (night series) at
Sydney Sportsground on April
15. Prague played delightful
Soccer, and is the team to beat
in this year’s Federation com-
petition. Star centre-forward
Baumgartner scored three
goals and once again staked
a claim to be called the greatest
Soccer player ever to be seen
in action in Australia.
“Miowera”: Hungarian
Gyula Polgar, coach of Apia,
has been put in charge of the
Sydney Soccer Federation
squad from which will come
the sides to play the Costa
Rican club Deportivo Saprissa
and Scottish club Hearts of
Midlothian. Polgar, a former
crack Hungarian international,
will be assisted by Prague
captain - coach Baumgartner,
who looks certain to captain
the N.S.W. team. The squad
selected is well balanced, and
reputations did not sway the
selectors too much ; several
veterans were dropped to make
way for promising youngsters.
The team is being given the
most extensive training-scheme
ever organised in Australia,
and should become a formid-
able combination.
* * *
The V.F.A.’s decision to
reduce the number of players
to 16 seems to have paid-off.
High scoring, indicative of
fast, open football, was a
feature of the first round, in
which four of the eight win-
ning teams kicked over 20 goals
each (three of them kicked the
same tally, 22, while last year's
premiers, Williamstown, kicked
26), and in every game at
least 150 points were scored,
in four of them the tally being
more than 200. One full-
forward booted 11 goals, and
two others 10 goals each.
“Blue”: Lew Holmes,
president of Calton (V.F.L.)
club, was called upon to per-
form an unusual task before
the opening game against
Essendon. Relations of Jim
Marchbanks, a champion of
Carlton’s successive premier-
ship years of 1906-07-08, asked
that his ashes be scattered on
Prince’s Hill Oval, Carlton.
Nine of Marchbanks’s old
team-mates were able to be
present at the ceremony.
“Magpie”: The V.F.L. has
lost one of its most colorful
players in Bill Twomey, oldest
of three brothers who have
starred with Collingwood in
post-war years (Mick is still
playing). Twomey played 190
games in 14 seasons, and was
going to give it a go again
this season, but a persistent
cartilage injury has forced him
to retire, thus preventing him
from joining the select band
who completed 15 playing
seasons with ’Wood. Twomey
skippered the Magpies in 1957
and played in every field posi-
tion except the last line of
defence. His father was one of
the most famous players the
State produced.
“Old Pivot”: Melbourne's
success in getting North Laun-
ceston to clear follower Bob
Johnson created a problem in
identification, as Melbourne
already, of course, has a Bob
Johnson, one of the V.F.L.’s
best (as well as tallest) ruckmen
in recent years. Melbourne
has been after the second Bob
Johnson for some time. Prob-
lem was solved by giving the
new player, who has taken over
fellow-Tasmanian Peter Mar-
quis’s full-back position, the
sobriquet “Tassie.” There is a
third Johnson, Trevor, also in
the first XVJII; the three are
not related.

“R.G.E.”: Queensland Uni-
versity’s win in the State’s

their last win, in 1953. With
a mile to go, No. 6, weakened

overboard. The quick-thinking
stroke decided that the police-
launch reach him
before the sharks, which had
circled the light shells at the
start, and pushed ’Varsity over
the line first in very good time.
Subsequent attempts to dis-
qualify the crew on the ground
that it didn’t row eight men
got “crabbed,” and the result
stood. It is the only known
championship crew to win with
an incomplete complement. In-
cidentally, one of the 1953 crew
was Dr. “Chilla” Wilson, who
led the Australian Rugby
Union team to N.Z. last year.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
"LAW" IN RED CHINA
[Part 1]
This article on “Recent Legal Developments in the
People’s Republic of China” was prepared for publication
by the International Commission of Jurists at the Hague,
the Australian member of which is Sir Owen Dixon, Chief
Justice of the High Court of Australia.
The purpose of the commission is “to contribute to the
establishment of a world in peace under law” —corresponding
to the concept of the Rule of Law.
This article, taken from the commission’s “Bulletin,”
is based entirely on source-material published in Peking or
Shanghai by Red Chinese agencies of one sort or another,
and therefore speaks for itself.
TThere are areas in which
individual liberty inevit-
ably comes into conflict with
national security. But in free
society the ultimate solution
to this conflict rests in sub-
stantial measure with an inde-
pendent judiciary which is
empowered within limits to
review actions taken by the
executive and the legislature.
In the People’s Republic of
China, the position of the
judiciary vis-a-vis the executive
provides an interesting
example of the opposite
extreme. It may be recalled
that shortly after a brief period
of relative freedom following
Mao Tse-tung's famous speech
on “contending and bloom-
ing,” delivered in two parts in
February and March, 1957, the
legal profession has been
sharply criticised for not being
severe enough in dealing with
“counter-revolutionaries.”
In December, 1957, four
members of the Supreme
People’s Court were brought
under severe attack for their
advocacy of “judicial independ-
ence.” One of them was Chia
Ch’ien, Chief Justice of the
Criminal Court. Chief Justice
Chia argued that “the court
handles matters affecting
people’s lives, freedom and
property, and has the power
of life and death, investment
and deprivation,” and that
therefore the court may refuse
to accept “party” leadership.
For refusing to adhere to the
theory that the court should
follow party leadership, the
Chief Justice was accused of
deviationism. For challenging
the correctness of the leader-
ship of party committee-
members on the ground that
they do not understand law
and are not familiar with actual
conditions, Chia Ch’ien was
denounced as being “madly
conceited and childishly
ignorant.”
This point was considered
once more in January, 1958,
in a speech by Wu Te-feng,
deputy-chairman of the China
Political and Legal Affairs
Society, “on the preservation
of the socialist legal system”:
The Rightists have said that the
party is a “layman"’ in legal matters
and that as such should not head
legal work. This is also absurd.
In China, the legal system has been
created under the leadership of the
Communist party, in accordance
with the principles of Marxism-
Leninism and the experiences of the
people themselves in the course of
class-struggle . . . Observe, for
instance, the results of our legal
work. We have abrogated the old
laws of the Kuomintang, and
enacted and promulgated various
important laws in accordance with
the needs of the revolutionary
struggle and construction. The
Communist party has shown great
legal knowledge and ability to lead
legal work. In abolishing the Book
of Six Laws of the Kuomintang,
the Communist party made a
detailed and correct analysis of the
appropriateness of the “book.”
Who could have done such work?
The have accused the
party of interfering with the trial
work of the court. This is likewise
absurd. We all know that laws
have to be administered according
to policies of the State, and it is
the Communist party which is the
most capable of deciding such
policies in the interests of all the
people. The party does not inter-
fere with the courts’ independent
trial as long as they adhere to the
policies of the State. Is there
anything wrong with such leader-
ship and supervision?
It is interesting to note in
this connection that the aboli-
tion of the old law which took
place in 1949 was followed by
a period of absence of law.
Recently some 4000-odd laws
and ordinances are reported to
have been promulgated,
although the long-promised
penal code is not yet com-
pleted. Supervision by the
party is in effect complete con-
trol of the judiciary by the
New York “Herald Tribune.”
BURDEN OF GRATITUDE
executive. The court is in
actual fact “assisted” by a
Judgment Committee which,
apart from reviewing import-
ant and difficult cases, is
empowered to deal with any
cases that, after pronounce-
ment of verdicts, are found to
have been “wrongly adjudi-
cated.”
The review of judicial deci-
sions by the executive involves
no special hearings. Neither
the trial judge in all cases, nor
in criminal cases the accused,
has the right to be heard.
The executive power of
review provides an important
means for the Communist
party to test the “accuracy” of
judicial decisions, and, on the
basis of the results obtained,
to compile statistics on the per-
centage of cases “wrongly” and
“rightly” decided.
This is of extreme •import-
ance especially when the pro-
motion, renewal of appoint-
ment and dismissal of judges
and assessors may be based on
these statistics.
The Chinese Communist
. press gave wide publicity to
the establishment after July,
1954, of legal advisory offices
throughout the country to pro-
vide “free legal service” for the
public. This does not mean,
however, that any person seek-
ing redress or brought to trial
in the People’s Republic of
China may call upon the
lawyers in these offices and is
entitled to free legal advice and
representation. Jt should be
remembered that the lawyers’
organisation, too, has become
a political organisation.
Jt is established, as Lin Fzu-
ch'iang,'a Chinese Communist
lawyer, recently wrote,
“according to the wishes of
the party and the people, and
although it is a social body,
and not a State organ, State
and society today are led by
the working-class and its van-
guard —the Communist party.
It is unthinkable that the
lawyers’ organisation could
discharge the task entrusted to
it by the party without party-
leadership.”
Thus lawyers are told, in
effect, that they must not
undertake the defence of any-
one who may be suspected of
counter - revolutionary senti-
ments —this includes, inter alia,
persons seeking the return of
confiscated property.
Lawyers are warned that by
doing so they would be advanc-
ing the cause of counter-
revolution and become suspect
themselves. Persons accused
of counter - revolutionary


offences are in practice denied
the right to legal representa-
tion.
This is of growing import-
ance and should be viewed
with grave concern in the light
of recent discussions in the
legal circles of the regime on
the treatment of crimes as
“contradictions between the
enemy and ourselves,” thus
placing all or most criminals
under the proletarian dictator-
ship ; that is to say, subject-
ing them to administrative and
“judicial” measures designed
for the elimination of counter-
revolutionaries.
Instances of such measures
are trial by the mass in cases
concerning counter-revolution-
ary activities, trial by the
workers in cases of industrial
crimes, and immediate execu-'
tion of death sentences in the
presence of those witnessing
the trial.
The trial is generally held
in the open air, or in a factory.
A racecourse in Shanghai, for
instance, has been used for
spectacular trials of counter-
revolutionaries. To give
another example, an exhibi-
tion of incriminating evidence
against counter-revolutionaries
was recently held in Anshan
(Lianoning). These are but
part of a nation-wide campaign
for the suppression of counter-
revolutionaries.
After the abolition of the
Chinese Code, Chine'se lawyers
on the mainland were required
to go through a special course
of legal training before they
were assigned to different posts
in the law courts and other
legal institutions. The so-
called reform of the legal pro-
fession took place in 1952 —the
year notable for the Sanfan
and Wufan opposition move-
ments in the wake of the sup-
pression of the counter-
revolutionary movements in
1951.
The 1952 reform of the legal
profession was considered by
the Chinese Communists as a
great success for having
“purged the old legal concepts.”
But it was admitted by Shih
Liang, the Minister of Justice,
a woman lawyer, that the
reform “had been violently
attacked by the Rightists.” In
her published report to the
Chinese Communist Party
Congress, Shih Liang stated
that as a result of such reform,
“7 per cent, of the Chinese
lawyers were expelled and
punished, 70 per cent, of them
were given employment other
than legal practice, and 20 per
cent, were retained in the pro-
fession of law.” The report
gave no account for the remain-
ing 3 per cent, of lawyers.
In reply to the criticism of
the “Rightists” that the judges
of the existing . Communist
courts were none other than
legal ignoramuses, the Minister
of Justice argued that between
January and July, 1957, the
judges, who were formerly
workers, farmers and shop
clerks, had dealt with 7000
cases in Shanghai alone and
not one case was wrongly
adjudicated!
In the People’s Republic of
China, there are six law facul-
ties in the so-called Compre-
hensive Universities which are
under the direct supervision of
the Ministry of Higher Educa-
tion. Under the direction of
the Ministry of Justice there
are four Colleges for Politics
and Law and"* three legal
training-schools situated in
Chungking, Tsinan and
Shanghai.
There are also the so-called
Kanpu (cadre) Schools of
Politics and Law in North-
east, North-west and Central-
south China. In each province
there are kanpu training-
courses. During the past years
the kanpu schools had trained
about 20,000 legal kanpu. The
figure has often been quoted
by the Communist party to

RUSSIAN field-marshals.
Illingworth, in London “Daily Mail.”
I hope he doesn’t treat me like he treats
WESTERN politicians.
refute the Rightist criticism
that “legal education under the
Communist regime regressed
by some 20 years.”
Of the four colleges for
politics and law, the most
important one is the Peking
College for Politics and Law
established in 1952. It appears
that until now, even in this
important college, there is not
a single textbook on current
Chinese law. The teachers in
the law colleges rely entirely
upon the legal textbooks used
in Soviet Russia.
The students of law have
openly called teachers the
“sound-recorders” and students
themselves the “typewriters.”
They also complained that they
were “not going to be judges
in Soviet Russia.” In the
summer of 1956, mindful of
the general reaction against
Russification in the legal educa-
tion, the Ministries for Higher
Education and for Justice held
a joint conference discussing a
teaching plan for the four col-
leges. In that conference it
was decided that in the teach-
ing of law, the main emphasis
should be laid on Chinese legal
materials and the Russian
literature would be subsidiary,
In implementation of this new
teaching-plan, the text of
Theory of State and Law,
written by a lawyer, Chang
Hsin, was adopted as a new
textbook of which 150 copies
were printed for circulation
among the teachers of law.
There has been a complaint
of downgrading of the legal
education in reference to the
underrating of legal research
and the low salary for the pro-
fessors of law as compared with
other professors. This com-
plaint was fully reflected in an
article written by Han Te-p’ei,
the Dean of the Law School
of Wuhan University, who
complained that, while the
salary-scale for the professors
of other faculties had been re-
adjusted, the pay of law pro-
fessors was reduced. He also
complained of the scarcity of
material available for research-
work due to inaccessibility of
many legal publications, par-
ticularly those relating to legal
developments in the capitalist
countries.

Adenauer Moves
Upstairs
T* RE f s . comment on r.
Adenauer s decision to
accept nomination for the
Presidency of West Germany.
London “New Statesman :
“Observers have been quick to
argue that Dr. Adenauer’s
acceptance was a result of a
clever manoeuvre by his critics
within the C.D.U. rather than
a deliberate decision of his
own. Though the Chancellor s
hold over his party has weaken-
ed within the last year, it
would be unwise to lend too
much weight to this explana-
tion. He can, if he chooses,
remain in office as Chancellor
until the summit negotiations
are well under way or
abandoned—and as President
he will play a much larger part
in politics--than his predecessor,
“He may, indeed, have been
impressed by the constitutional
role General de Gaulle has
carved-out for himself and be
aiming at creating a similar
one for himself: the German
Constitution is still flexible,
and Dr. Adenauer carries
enough personal authority to
bend it to his wishes. It will
in any case be some time
before his successor will be
powerful enough to alter the
main lines of post-war internal
or external policy.”
* * *
London “Daily Express”:
“The inflexibility of the Chan-
cellor has alarmed his most
loyal adherents. His apparent
refusal even to consider the
new ideas produced by Mr.
Macmillan [on the Berlin issue]
has been a drag on the pro-
gress towards peace.
“Dr. Adenauer is seeking to
retain his power, even in his

it will be up to him to show

tive role to play in the search
for peace.”

“Yorkshire Post”: “Some
people interpret this startling
move as evidence that this
Iron Chancellor, with his rigid
attitude towards the problems
of European security, has lost
some of his hold over his party.

new era may be dawning with
his departure from his long-
held office, and that we may
now see a more flexible
approach towards a summit
conference.

“But Dr. Adenauer is 83.
Remarkable man as he is, it
may not be necessary to look
beyond his advanced age for
the reasons behind his decision
to seek a less burdensome post-
Nor is it at all certain that once,
he relinquishes the Chancellor-
ship and is elected President his
influence over West German
policy will decline. Of his great
services to his country and to
Western Europe as a whole
there can be no question. He
may now think that, since he
cannot remain in control for
many more years in any event,
he will best serve Germany
and the causes in which he so
firmly believes by quitting
office at this time.”

“Manchester G uardian’s”
Paris correspondent: “After
24 hours’ reflection French
opinion has crystallised about
Dr. Adenauer’s decision:
officials feel that his objective
in standing for the Presidency
is, in the words of ‘Le Monde,’
‘above all to assure the con-
tinuation of his policy in
Germany.’ This naturally does
not displease the present
French Government, whose
members so frequently stress
the importance of the new
Bonn-Paris alliance. It is also
generally believed that Dr.
Adenauer discussed his decision
with General de Gaulle when
he last visited Paris.”
* * #
“Manchester Guardian’s”
West German correspondent:
“West German newspapers
have, without exception, ex-
pressed astonishment at the
Chancellor’s decision. Here
and there is a note of fore-
boding, even where the writers
are not supporters of his
Christian Democratic party.
The ‘West Deutsche Allge-
meine,’ for instance, fears a
break in his firm line of foreign
policy, and, in the domestic
field, a swing to the Right.
“The same paper has printed
the views of a large number of
readers. These show that the
bulk of the Christian Demo-
cratic voters are alarmed over
Dr. Adenauer’s withdrawal. To
them ‘Der Alte’ —‘the old one’
—has become a household
phrase, a symbol of security
and prosperity. No successor
is likely to instill the same
quiet confidence.”
Monty for Moscow
A sampling of U.K. editorial
comment on the announce-
ment of Field-Marshal Mont-
gomery’s intention to visit
Moscow:
London “Economist”: “Any-
one who knows Lord Mont-
gomery will not find it hard to
believe that his march on
Moscow is exactly what he
says it is: a personal recon-
naissance, born of his own
restless energy, and neither
inspired by nor involving the
British Government.
“Some of those who accept
this version will applaud him
for trying to make an indi-
vidual contribution to frank
understanding between Russia
and the West; some will rue-
fully recall past occasions
when the Field-Marshal’s inter-
ventions in diplomacy have
merely added to the confusion.
But the obvious point about his
latest enterprise is that a great
many people will never believe
that he is. not in some sense
an official British emissary.”

London “Daily Herald”:
“Monty, your one-man mission
to Moscow might just do some
good. It is a chance in a
million. But it might also do
harm. Terrible harm. And the
chances of this happening are
more than one in a million. A
lot more.
“If you want to go to
Moscow and look-up your old
pals, that’s all right by us. If
you want to be chums with
Khrushchev, that’s all right by
us, too. -v
“But don't meddle.
“The Summit is strictly out
of bounds.
“Politics is a business for
professionals. And no
politician on earth is more pro-
fessional than Khrushchev. He
could eat six peace-seeking
generals before breakfast.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph” :
“It should be perfectly obvious
to our allies that a private
mission of this kind reflects no
kind of Government initiative.
The Field-Marshal wants to
‘clear his mind’ about Soviet
attitudes, an experience he
could not permit himself so
long as he was deputy to the
Supreme Allied Commander.
If he returns with the con-
clusion that much of what
General Norstad and his staff
think is more wrong—or more
right than he thought, the
knowledge could be useful.
Even among commanders it is
safer to have an official oppo-
sition.”

London “News Chronicle'’:
“On purely political grounds,
apprehensive M.P.s should
remember that Montgomery
has done this before. In 1947
he visited Moscow with the
approval of Attlee and Bevin.
He is now taking another of
his calculated risks and feels
himself capable of dispelling
confusions.
“Yet on balance we feel that
the trip is a mistake. Mont-
gomery is an unpredictable
figure, and he has publicly
chosen an inopportune moment.
He may do Mr. Khrushchev
some good, and we hope that
he does ; but what is good
for Mr. Khrushchev is not
necessarily good for the
alliance.”
* * *
“Yorkshire Post" : “It has
been carefully—and truthfully
—explained that the Field-
Marshal will travel ‘at his own
responsibility’ and as ‘a private
citizen,’ and that Mr. Mac-
millan was informed of his
intentions ‘as a matter of
courtesy.’
“But an example of how
these affairs may be misunder-
stood occurred when it be-
came known that Lord Mont-
gomery had asked to see Mr.
Macmillan. Is it customary, it
was at once asked, for a
private citizen to see the Prime
Minister before he visits
Moscow? Mr. Macmillan
agreed to see Lord Mont-
gomery. It is pointed out that
he would not wish to do other-
wise. The Field-Marshal is an
old friend. This is well under-
stood here. It may not be
elsewhere.”


Indians, descendants of inden-
tured laborers, now outnumber
the native Fijians, with a few
thousand Europeans as a small
but dominant minority. In
most other island groups the
indigenous natives still com-
prise the majority of the popu-
lation. East and West New
Guinea are, of course, admini-
stered by Australia and the
Netherlands respectively and
both countries are working
to plans which provide for the
eventual self-government of
the Pacific’s largest island by
its own people. This is more-
or-less the long-term objective
envisaged for most of the
territories in the South Pacific,
though the transition will
naturally come more readily
and rapidly to some than to
others.
As the area from which they
are drawn offers such contrasts
it is not surprising that the
delegates who assemble today
at the Malaguna Technical
Training School at Rabaul
should differ widely in back-
ground and education.
All three members of the
Fijian delegation are University
graduates. H. B. Gibson is a
New Zealander with a legal
practice in Fiji; Dr. A. H.
Sahu Khan, an Indian physi-
cian who graduated at the Uni-
versity of Otago (N.Z.) ; and
Semesa K. Sikivou, who took
an M.A. degree at Auckland
University and a Diploma in
Education at London Univer-
sity.
The Tonga delegates are the
Crown Prince Tungi, who was
educated at Newington College,
Sydney, and graduated in
Arts and Law at Sydney Uni-
versity, and his brother, Prince
Tu'ipelehake, who also went to
Newington and, later, to
Gatton Agricultural College in
Queensland. With them as
adviser is Mahe ’Uli’uli
Tupounia who graduated in
Commerce at Auckland Uni-
versity.
Delegations from other
territories include men and
women who received part of
their education in Australia,
New Zealand, England, France,
Holland, Hawaii or America.
In contrast there are many who
have never been outside the
South Pacific area and some
who have just left their own
island for the first time.
Most of the delegates from
U.S. Trust Territories were
born while the islands were
under Japanese mandate, but
Elias P. Sablan, from Saipan,
claims to go back further than
that. “During my lifetime I
have lived under five flags. I
was born on November 8, 1899,
the day the Spanish flag was
lowered in the Marianas. I have
experienced the German and
Japanese periods of admini-
stration and now live under the
American flag, along with that
of the United Nations.” The
Elias P. is no belated tribute
to Sablan’s latest flag. His
father spent seven years in the
United States about 80 years
ago, being taken there as a
lad by the skipper of a New
bedford whaler.
Once a cable - operator,
Sablan has filled many roles
since the end of the Pacific
War —a year as Chief of
Police at Camp Susupe, eight
years Mayor of Saipan and,
since 1953, a member of the
Saipan Congress. He also
owns and operates a grocery
store, is a judge of the Com-
munity Court and chairman
of the Saipan Board of Edu-
cation.
C. E. Sayers, a former
London editor of Australian
Associated Press, who attended
the second and third South
Pacific Conferences and is also
covering the present one,
recorded in “The S.P.C.
Quarterly Bulletin” his im-
pressions of the gatherings
Sayers noticed that the nervous-
ness which, not unnaturally,
characterised the first con-
ference, disappeared at sub-
sequent ones, “giving place to
a more positive note in dele-
gates’ speeches, more inde-
pendence in thinking and in
the general approach to the
problems set down for dis-
cussion.”
He recorded that it was the
firm view of delegates from
all parts of the area that while
full advantage should be taken
of lessons in social advance-
ment in health and hygiene and
in economic development there
should be as little interference
as possible with the good things
of their ancient culture. Sayers
was particularly impressed with
the conduct of the last confer-
ence by chairmen chosen from
among the delegates. Looking
back in retrospect to his first
conference, he says:
Two impressions abide from that
1953 introduction to the most
pleasant of the world’s peoples;
their earnest courtesy and their
sincere simplicity. I have had no
reason to vary that impression
since; indeed, it has hardened into
certainty as my admiration for the
islanders and their good sense grows.
Faith in the
Future
These are times in which nations must use
their best brains to keep up in the race for
survival and progress.
Knowledge has been widened, new skills have
been introduced, marvellous machines have been
assembled. And this has created its own need; the
need for minds that will enable us to take
full advantage of what offers in a world of
abounding performance.
Older countries have come to realise it.
Some of Britain’s best civilian brains have
been recruited to patriotic service. One instance
of that is in the successful British drive for
industrial power from the atom. Many of the men
influencing that programme at the top are not on
any official pay-roll.
A similar example is the National Research
Development Corporation, which is getting
remarkable results in applying the benefits of
modern science to British industry.
In the United States the civilian brain force
is freely enlisted to assist the Administration. The
Americans have also developed a system of private
or privately-endowed “brain centres,” whose
specialists are retained to supply facts and
conclusions which help Government thinking on
defence and other major problems.
The larger of these institutes are equipped to
advise on an amazing range of questions;
mathematical, scientific, economic, social or plain
utilitarian. Commerce avails widely of" their
services to promote efficiency.
In Australia our numbers are fewer. For every
one person in this country there are more than
seventeen in the U.S.A. and five in Britain. That,
to me, accentuates the need for our employing
fully the talents we do possess.
To suggest this is not to reflect on the quality
of our elected leaders, or the Public Service, or our
excellent scientific and educational bodies.
It is simply to say that Australia has a store of
experienced brain-power in the community at large
—and, taking our cue from the larger democracies,
I believe we could be drawing more upon its
available energy now to quicken our march into
the future.
H. Hastings Deening


and it was obvious J.K.’s advice
was well founded.
In Alice Springs, Nick
Muldoon took my hand in his
big fist, and smiled: “This is
like J.K. Didn’t you know he
died a month ago quite
suddenly? I had a telegram
waiting for me when I came
back from holidays. I was
sorry I couldn’t go to the
funeral. I believe it was a
big one. Bill Harney flew down
as soon as he heard.
“No, I’m afraid I’m not an
authority on The Alice. I’ve
only been here twenty-eight
years. You should see some-
one who really knows the place
.. . Yes, flowers grow well
here, if you can give them
enough water, but I’m not
proud of what you see there.
The garden’s gone to pieces
while I was away. Tomorrow,
I’ll start ripping it out . .
'T'hen Bill Harney—and Bill
Harney was worth meet-
ing.
1 had met each man in his
environment —Mr. O’Brien in
an office lined with vintage
photographs and memories;
Nick Muldoon in his garden ;
and now Bill Harney in the
majestic shadow of Ayers
Rock. Bill was always up
before dawn, brewing billy-
tea and watching the tourists
taking their dawn shots of The
Rock.
“Come on over here and get
warm! Don’t know about you
Canadians! Every time I see
you, you’re shiverin’.”
As Doug Lockwood has
said: “Bill Harney is the
biggest talker in the Northern
Territory and the easiest to
listen to.” But when I men-
tioned J.K.* Bill lost his bluff
heartiness. The sudden silence
gripped us in the greatest
tribute one can ever pay to
him who has gone before. I
looked at Bill. His shock of
white hair was still rumpled
from sleep, his rugged cheeks
seemed more lined and his
blue eyes moist.
We warmed our hands in
the flames flickering up from
the mulga-wood fire. And Bill
said softly and slowly:
“I flew down to the funeral.
It was all I could do. J.K.
was a great man and a great
mate.”
A thousand miles to the
south, at Auburn, Mrs.
Jean Glover leaned over her
shop-counter—fruit and vege-
tables in back-drop and
showed me a different J.K.
Her eyes were sad and her
gentle voice regretful, but sud-
denly she remembered J.K. as
he had bounced into her shop
on his way north with Mr.
Bill Stone.
“He was like a little boy
wagging school. Such non-
sense! We had a jolly time.
There was so much to talk
about and so much to do. He
wanted to see inside the church
at Penwortham, and you know
this is the birthplace of C. J.
Dennis. J.K. wasn’t still a
moment. I shall always
remember him bursting with
energy. It isn’t possible that
such a vital personality can
be gone.”
“It isn’t gone,” I said. “It’s
followed me around Aus-
tralia. I have experienced only
a small part of the spirit that
still lives in the lives of all
who knew him.”
That feeling gained fresh
impetus as 1 talked to lan
Mudie in his Glenelg study.
He leaned back in his chair,
touched his finger-tips together,
and smiled thoughtfully:
“It wouldn’t be possible to
estimate all the good J. K.
Moir has done. It was con-
stant, consistent and unspar-
ing. At all hours of the night
or day, all seasons of the year,
the little house in Bridge Road,
Richmond, in Melbourne, was
open to anyone. He went to
infinite pains to preserve early
records, writings and data. He
bought when he couldn’t afford
to —not only books but hand-
craft and native arts. His
house was a museum —every-
thing imaginable of Austra-
liana. He rescued priceless
items from oblivion because
no one else could be bothered,
and he gave away as much as
he gathered. He didn’t write,
except to be a prodigious
correspondent, but he has done
more for Australian letters
than anyone else in his time.”
TYriving over the long, sol i-
tary stretches of the
Nullarbor Plains, J.K.’s words
came back to me:
“Some people freight their
cars over the Nullarbor and
down from The Alice, but if
you really want to see Aus-
tralia you’ll find even the
dreary places interesting. After
all, even that is a part of
Australia!”. . .
Perth was bathed in sun-
shine. The Swan River
sparkled, and the conference-
room at the Technical Corres-
pondence School had a wel-
come heat after the cold winds
of Norseman. John K. Ewers,
seated in the big leather-
bottomed chair, tapped the
letter thoughtfully. That letter
—three hastily scribbled sheets
of advice—was alive with
meaning. It had stirred so
many memories, accumulated
so much feeling and enriched
several conversations.
“I hardly know where to
begin,” John Ewers said at
last, watching the smoke curl
from the tip of his cigarette.
“I knew him well, and my
memories are a mixture of a
man who loved life and
enjoyed it. He was human,
lovable and completely him-
self. He exhausted himself
helping others—giving un-
stintingly of time, energy and
his house. Often I got letters
written at two a.m. after every-
one had gone. Perhaps his
greatest virtue was his
generosity. He not only gave
of what he had, but if a period-
piece came up for sale and he
knew someone else wanted it,
he queried that person first.
Sometimes his need for it was
obviously the greater, but J.K.
never thought of himself. He
was happy in another’s
pleasure.
“He had a big, old double-
bed in his house that was in
constant use by transient
writers, poets and artists. I told
him once he should have had
all his visitors carve their
initials on it. It would have
been a fine record. I think
everyone in the literary world
visited him.”
Tn the quiet lounge-room with
the smooth waters of the
Swan River far below,
Henrietta Drake - Brockman
read J.K.’s letter. She was
pushed by a multitude of com-
mitments, from reading proofs
of the forthcoming Westralian
Fellowship anthology of
Joseph Furphy to arranging
for several people to attend the
opening of the new Skinner
Gallery.
“J'?K. formed a club, you
know, the Bread and Cheese
Club, and he edited their paper
‘Bohemia.’ He had long been
interested —in a desultory sort
of way—in Australian books.
Then he grew interested in the
writers. In quite a casual way,
he began collecting. It was his
life —really his life. He built-
up a magnificent library. One
beautiful, enormous volume I
was lucky enough to see when
it was delivered to him was
Heemskerck Shoals, by
Robert Fitz Gerald—a luxury
edition completely hand-made.
Now his whole library has
been sent to Canberra as the
J K. Moir Memorial Collec-
tion.
“I think he was liked because
he never indulged in criticism.
He was the friend of all who
wrote. Because he met so
many, he was able to introduce
them to each other and always
eager to do so. He mixed
bushman and scholar, states-
man and clerk. He made no
discrimination whatsoever. He
was the touchstone of Austra-
lian mateship.” . . .
li/fARY Durack was at home.
It was Guy Fawkes
Night, and the Miller house
was vibrating. The ecstatic
chatter of the little one, the
wisdom of the knowing nine,
the pony-tail poised for flight,
and the settled later ’teens with
career-wise eyes! There were
five in all—every age-group
lived and moved and had its
being in a burgeoning of self-
fulfilment that swept one along
in its exuberance.
When things had in general
come to earth, Mary Durack
settled in a big comfy chair
and thought about J.K. The
dog curled up asleep beside
her, and the cat sprawled full-
length on the rug at her feet.
“No, I didn’t have the privi-
lege of meeting J.K., but I
knew him well through his
letters to me. He treated Aus-
tralian writers and artists as
members of a big family—his
family. He kept us together.
He hung our pictures, filed our
letters, shelved our books,
watched our progress and held
us closely to the soul of our
country. His affection, under-
standing and generosity were
big enough for everyone, but
his biggest love was Australia.
He made us a sort of brother-
hood, and left an emptiness
that no one will be able to
fill. He was in his own right
a wonderful little man.”
Mary Durack went on in her
quiet way, putting a poetic
atmosphere in her reminiscings
that marked the warmth of her
feelings. She completed a pic-
ture 1 had travelled 6000 miles
to get. Yet it was only part
of the picture. In many an
Australian heart—who can
guess how many?—there burns
a shrine of remembrance for a
little grey-haired man who was
a friend. As the “Bohemian”
quotes:
It is the end of evensong —
He sleeps but finds perpetual
birth
Within our hearts, within our
earth!


Lack of Intelligence
By "R. R. D."
A mbassadors are second-
chop nowadays. Their
proper work is done for them
by Foreign Secretaries or even
by Prime Ministers. Like the
pound sterling and every-
thing else in the Priority State,
they’ve lost their value and so
forfeited their title. Diplomatic
standing is not what it used
to be, before trade and
“cultural” attaches came on
the scene. True, the members
of the corps still insist on
“prestige”—but have you ever
looked up the derivation of this
word in a dictionary?
We owe the foundations of
our prosperity to a system of
aristocracy, which the Russians -
are doing their utmost to copy.
The meaning of aristocracy,
of course, is “government by
the best citizens” —it has
nothing to do with beer-barons.
As far as the British race was
concerned, this system meant
(and still does mean, though
in a more constricted circle)
those who count their country’s
service an honor not to be
measured in terms of £.s.d.
This, of course, is directly
opposed to the modern view—•
the better the man, the bigger
the screw. You don’t find many
Ambassadors nowadays “lying
abroad for their country’s
good” very largely at their own
expense. That used to be the
way, when we won diplomatic
victories, but since then times
have changed.
Now that diplomats, like
politicians, rely on the tax-
payers of their country to keep
up their state, it might be
expected that they would add
efficiency to the guile of their
less-costly predecessors. But
this is not evident.
Take the last few years. Who
foresaw Nasser’s “officers’
revolt” and its consequences,
or the coup d’etat in Iraq
(though, it must be admitted,
Nuri was caught too), or
the trouble in Cuba? Anyone
who did must have kept very
quiet about it, for the Western
nations seem to have been
caught on the wrong foot each
time —and there are other
examples, too. Of course,
Graham Greene jumped the
pistol on the last event and his
publishers must have blessed
the fact that Our Man in
Havana appeared at the
psychological moment
The Communists, of course,
get over this sort of difficulty
with ease. Their new-style
diplomacy appeals directly to
the masses over the heads of
Governments. (That’s why Mr.
Mikoyan made his tour and
consolidated his appeal.) The
system cuts both ways—having
won the confidence of the
people, Communist diplomats
are in return taken into the
people’s confidence, so they’re
always a jump or two ahead.
“So that's what happened to my snuff!"
Western diplomacy lags
behind, living in the past but
failing to reach the standards
of those days.
Even if the foreign service
has become just another branch
of the bureaucratic tree and
Embassies no more than ex-
pensive post-offices, at least
taxpayers can expect the
production of proper military
intelligence from there, with
some attempt made to work
on it. Nobody imagines that
the Ambassador and his
counsellors should spend their
time in disreputable bars,
gossiping with the unsavory
types who tell you what really
goes on. But they should have
people on their staff who can
do this, and also some means
of collecting and sifting this
information for intelligent
counter-action. That’s one of
the reasons for the existence
of Embassies and Legations—
as we shouldn’t forget at this
moment when Russia is seeking
to reopen her Embassy here,
just when Australia is begin-
ning to become a power to be
reckoned with in the struggle
against Communism. •
It used to be done. The
following is fiction ; it’s from
John Buchan’s Greenmantle,
but probably not far short of
the truth:
We have had our agents working
in Persia and Mesopotamia for
years—mostly young officers of the
Indian Army. They carry their lives
in their hand, and every now and
then one disappears and the sewers
of Baghdad might tell a tale. But
they find out many things, and they
count the game worth the candle.
Tlaat was in the days when
our Government was apprised
of what was going on in time
to take counter - measures,
which have until now ensured
our survival as free men. No
doubt there still are people
doing it, but are they the right
people and are they going to
the right places?
What’s wrong with the old
firm? Judging by Graham
Greene’s divertissement, almost
everything—mainly the fact
that these young officers did it
for the love of their country
and not for pay or personal
“prestige.” Their efforts were a
true bill, and worked.
That’s excuse enough for the
“experts” to step in nowadays
and take over the running of
a show. The simple citizen
doesn’t know and doesn’t want
to know how military intelli-
gence is collected, so long as
it is done. So he must hope
that Greene’s tongue was firmly
in his cheek when he wrote his
account of Our Man in
Havana. But, judging by the
results, he is entitled to wonder.


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Honorary Degrees
Why are. Australian uni-
versities slow in granting
honorary degress to people
who have done outstanding
work but who are not gradu-
ates?
A case in point concerned a
State university which years
ago declined to award the de-
gree of Bachelor of Science to
a brilliant student —at one of
his school examinations he had
failed to pass in mathematics.
It didn’t matter that he had
passed in this subject at sub-
sequent examinations; he
would have to sit for, and pass,
this exam, before going on to
the B.Sc.
He declined, secured a posi-
tion with an agricultural
organisation and did such
important work that he was
awarded the highest of all
scientific honors —Fellow of
the Royal Society of London.
Then Canberra granted him a
Doctorate in Science, and the
university which refused him
a B.Sc. has had to swallow its
pride and, at a special cere-
mony, award him the same
doctorate ad eundem gradum !
Another man graduated
B.Sc. some 30 years ago, and
has since done original work
which has won fame for him
abroad. One day he asked how
much additional work he
would have to do before being
awarded the D.Sc. He was
told that he would have to
follow the usual rule of writ-
ing and submitting a special
thesis.
He pointed out, in vain, that
he had already published suffi-
cient original work to earn
this degree several times ; to
write the thesis would be a
serious interruption of special
work in collaboration with an
American university. But—no
thesis, no doctorate.
The field of arts is even
worse off. The Australian rule
is that a writer must first
graduate B.A. Then a thesis
must be written on a subject
usually a biography
approved by the Dean of the
Faculty of Arts. It doesn’t
matter that not one in 200 of
such theses is good enough to
be published in book-form ; it
will earn the M.A.
To gain a Doctorate in
Literature a book must be
published after the M-A. has
been secured. This is never a
creative work, such as a novel
or a volume of short-stories;
it is usually a “critical evalua-
tion” of some working writer
who never saw the inside of a
university. None of our uni-
versities confers degrees on the
people who did the original
writing.
By adopting this attitude our
universities imply that there is
no real merit in writing many
novels, hundreds of short-
stories or successful plays;
what really counts is the
ability to criticise the work of
others, even if the critic can’t
turn-out a piece of fiction good
enough for a third-rate maga-
zine.
Surely some Australian
writers whose work is on the
list of required reading for
the degree of B.A. at our State
universities deserve awards?
After all, they’re responsible
for creating good literature. —

Unused Parks
Children living in large
blocks of fiats aren’t the only
ones who appear to spend most
of their spare time at TV or
other forms of artificial enter-
tainment (B. 18 /3 / ’59). Scant
use of park playing-space—
except for organised school
sport—is a feature of the
middle-class Sydney suburb in
which I live.
My home is within easy
walk of two parks. Both have
three concrete cricket-pitches,
free for anyone to use except
when required for junior or
school matches. In winter one
park has two football-grounds
—Rugger and Soccer ; and the
other is used for hockey and
basketball by girls’ high-
schools. No one plays on
these grounds on Saturday
afternoons. Only rarely have
I seen more than a few boys,
outside school hours, playing
cricket and football, in either
park.
There must be dozens of
teenage boys living fairly near
these parks. In the long
Christmas holidays one would
expect to see a goodly number
regularly playing there. What’s
wrong with these green 'open
spaces? What’s wrong with
the children? — Morris the
Tinker (N.S.W.):
Drink and Deaths
Authoritative support for the
view that drinking is directly
or indirectly to blame for a
large percentage of road-deaths
came from the recent con-
ference of police-commissioners
in Sydney.
They announced that speed-
ing and the imprudent con-
sumption of liquor by drivers
were the main causes of fatal
road-accidents, and they agreed
that a driver who drank
enough liquor to become
exhilarated was often just as
great a menace as the heavy
drinker. Among other things,
the commissioners urged that
“courage and commonsense”
should be used to attack the
problem, and that rigid en-
forcement of the law, coupled
with heavier penalties, could
greatly reduce the road-toll.
Ever since road-accidents
became a force to be reckoned
with a section of the com-
munity has protested about
mixing drinking with driving.
Those warnings have been
treated with scorn by a selfish
minority of the motoring
public, who have persistently
scouted. the suggestion that
speeding is both dangerous and
a major cause of road-acci-
dents.
Commonsense should out-
law the foolish social custom
of taking “one for the road.”
It’s a practice that far too
often leads to tragedy.—
Ardoyne (Vic).
Denominational Schools
“Bolivar” (B. 8/4/’59)
should know that letters urging
Government support for de-
nominational schools appear
pretty regularly.
During the Federal elections
Labor’s new Senator, Dr.
F. S. C. Dittmer, was asked his
opinion on the subject. He
dismissed the matter, stating
that the Queensland scholar-
ship-allowance was £lB per
year. This meagre sum is given
only to a select number in
secondary - schools ; the
majority 6f primary-schools get
nothing at all.
When speaking of denomi-
national education, thought
usually turns to Catholic
schools, but Protestant
authorities also contribute
heavily. The bishop of the
C. of E. diocese of Townsville,
Bishop Shevill, has protested
publicly against the unjust
burden borne by denomi-
national schools.
In Government schools
throughout Australia the
average cost per child in 1953
was given at £59 6s. 7d. In
1956-57 the Victorian Govern-
ment allocated £3l million for
the primary- and secondary-
education of 339,000 children,
an average of over £9l for each
child. In the same period
enrolment at Catholic schools
in Australia totalled 348,000.
Bearing in mind the Victorian
figures, the obvious fact
emerges that these schools are
saving taxpayers something in
excess of £3O million.
It must be clear to “Bolivar”
that the denominational school
is contributing quite a bit to
the public purse for which
little or nothing is received in
return. —B. J. L. (Q.).
Public Leaders
“Magnoon’s” explanation of
why politicians are more highly
regarded in England than in
Australia (B. 4/3/’59) is
admirable.
Until after the Reform Bill
of 1832 the landed gentry
dominated English public life,
and this class continued to
provide most of the members
of the Commons for a good
many years after that. In 1865,
for instance, one-quarter of


the members were connected
with 31 families.
The mid-19th century saw
a great growth in numbers,
wealth and influence of the
middle-classes, who were edu-
cated in the same kind of
schools as the older landed
families — i.e., public schools.
Older public schools were re-
modelled on the system
pioneered at Rugby by Dr.
Arnold, and a host of new
schools on the same lines were
also established.
The 19th-century English
public school proved highly
successful; members of the
landed class, trained in the
same schools, followed the
same pattern. The type was
held in general admiration, and
its outlook and code of
manners provided strong
inspiration for the people.
Not until the .20th century
was there pronounced criticism
of the kind of education pro-
vided by the public schools.
In the 1900’s a leading Liberal
journalist and staunch demo-
crat, Sir Theodore Cook, had
such faith in the public-school
system that he expressed the
hope that its ideals would
become those of the whole of
British society.
As long as this class con-
tinues to maintain an outlook
basically akin to 4hat which
inspired it in the 19th century,
and is powerfully represented
in the Commons, public life
will be highly regarded—

Observatory Sites
Astronomy is of ever-
growing importance. The
Northern Hemisphere is well
supplied with giant telescopes,
placed on the most suitable
sites, but the world lacks a
modern observatory to study
that part of the cosmos seen
only in the Southern Hemis-
phere.
To achieve solid results, an
observatory has to be placed
at a high altitude in an area
having the maximum number
of clear nights. The air must
be as free as possible from
moisture, dust and smog.
Above all, the site must be
clear of sky-glare caused by
city lights.
Mt. Stromlo has proved to
be a most unsuitable site for
the Commonwealth Observa-
tory. It’s close to the glare of
Canberra’s lights and has an
average of no more than 100
clear nights a year.
A proposal is afoot to test
Mt. Arapiles, in western Vic-
toria, as an alternative site.
“I Wonder what my stars say for today ?”
Although it has some 230 clear
night-skies a year, its altitude
is less than 1000 ft. above sea-
level, and for six months of
the year there is a lot of mois-
ture in the air.
The clearest air is found in
desert regions. Central Aus-
tralia can hold its own with
any place in the world in this
respect. On over 300 nights a
year there isn’t as much as a
wisp of cloud, and the stars
shine with a steady and
astonishing brilliance.
If America was establishing
a branch of one of its famous
observatories in Australia, Mt.
Woodroffe, in the Musgrave
Ranges, would be bound to
receive serious consideration.
It is over 5000 ft. high, and it
shouldn’t be too hard to make
an access-road to its summit.
Even if this spot is too isolated,
there are several mountains in
the Flinders Ranges, out from
Port Augusta, which are more
than 3000 ft. high—and are
close to good roads and a rail-
way.
Then there is the flat-topped
Pewsey Vale Peak, easy to get
to, over 2000 ft. high. It is 30
miles in a direct line from
Adelaide, is screened from all
but a fraction of the sky-
glare of the city by an inter-
vening range and gets at least
250 clear nights a year.
Adelaide has a small, old
but good astronomical tele-
scope housed in a little
observatory, but the building
is right alongside the city’s
blaze of neon-lights and is
useless for any practical work.
Time to copy the American
example of making the site the
prime consideration. — Cano-
pus (S.A.).
Advice on Art
Concerning Felton Bequest
purchases, a Sundry Showman
in B. 1/4/’59 asks whether the
Bequest’s advisers are advising
altogether wisely.
The answer is that they are
advising according to their
knowledge of current
standards, which demand that
the less like Nature and the
more like Picasso a picture
looks the better; hence the
National Gallery gets a lot of
pictures of that sort.
The Felton’s past advisers
made recommendations
according to their knowledge
of current standards, and
current standards then de-
manded that the less like
Nature and the more like the
latest pet of the Royal
Academy a picture looked the
better: hence the gallery got
a lot of academic pictures.
Every now and then it held an
auction and, the standard
having changed, these one-
time masterpieces would be
knocked-down to the highest
bidder for a few guineas.
It might be argued that this
is an unfair comment on the
operations of the Bequest,
since the gallery has acquired
through its advisers such
timeless masterpieces as the
Rembrandts, the Van Eyck,
Rodin’s Minerva, the Con-
stables, the El Greco, the
Turners, the Greek Aphrodite
(where is that statue?), the
Corot, the Meldrums, etc. But
one must conclude that most
of these works were chosen,
not because the buyers under-
stood them, but because they
were paintings of universal
prestige.
Whistler said that he judged
a person’s taste not by the best
ornament he had in his house
but by the worst. The best
may have got there by acci-
dent, but the worst could only
be there because the owner
liked it.—M. G. S. (Vic.).
Production and Prices
Few people these days accept
the old economic theory that
increased production means
lower prices. It could happen
that way ; but for many obvi-
ous reasons it isn’t allowed to.
Milk and sugar are two good
examples. Milk-production in
N.S.W. during the present flush
season has been the highest on
record ; but there has been no
cut in prices, simply because
the Milk Board takes only the
same quantity from producers,
leaving them to dispose of the
surplus as best they can. Some
of it is fed to pigs, but prob-
ably a good portion of it is
simply thrown away. I live
within 40 miles of Sydney and
pay Is. a pint for the first pint
and ll|d. for each, succeeding
one, making milk a rather
costly item to buy in quantity.
The result is that consumers
can afford only their minimum
requirements, and even at that
the bill for two average per-
sons is at least 14s. a week.
Sugar, too, seems to be out
of the reach of a good many
people on low incomes. The
other day I saw where pro-
ducers intend to ask for
another increase, the excuse
being that production-costs
have risen by 400 per cent, in
the last couple of years, while
the retail-price has gone up
by only 100 per cent. There is
no suggestion of reducing
production-costs that might
upset somebody or mean a
lower standard of living for
some fortunate shareholders.
Oh no! The consumer will
cough-up.
An increased sugar-price,


while directly increasing the
cost of living, also affects the
price of a considerable num-
ber of food-lines and drinks,
The Federal and Queensland
Governments in the past have
supported the claims of sugar-
producers for price-increases,
and it can almost be taken for
granted they will do the same
this time.—Dix (N.S.W.).
Wildlife Protection
If our native fauna is to
have the protection to which,
by law, it is entitled, more than
a wildlife magazine will be
needed (B. 25/3/’59). In
Queensland the whole of the
coastal strip from Cardwell to
Thursday Island is a declared
wildlife sanctuary, yet flagrant
murder of protected birds is
commonplace.

Three things are necessary
to preserve our natural wild-
fife. First, all guns within a
wildlife sanctuary should be
licensed. No one would deny

and wallabies, the right to pot
the pests, but except for the
destruction of gazetted pests
there is no need for anyone to

I have travelled many miles, par-
ticularly on weekends, when the

minors with their ,225. Some have
refused to give their names, others
have said that they had permission
to shoot on property adjoining a
Crown reserve. One owner has
allowed shooters on his land, dis-
regarding the danger of bullets

Until wider powers are granted, no

tection of our native birds.
A lead has been given by the

the protection-laws in an effort
to preserve the wildlife of the
shire. But even granting the
“licensing, protection, adver-
tisement in all languages” pro-
gramme, we should do well to
remember the legal maxim
that “not only must justice be
done but it shall also appear
to have been done.”
Admonitions, warnings and
convicted-and-discharged deci-

Classifying Schoolchildren
“Parent’s” reply to my
letter on the classification of
school-children by age (B.
25/3/’59) typifies the difficul-
ties faced by schools in their
administrative problems. It is
so easy to complain, but what
are the alternatives?
The lowest age for admis-
sion to high-school—in N.S.W.
at least —is 11 years, six
months. Any child advanced
at that age is ready for uni-
versity at 16 years, six months.
But how many professors con-
sider that a satisfactory age
for tertiary education? Most,
I venture to say, regard it as
too young!
Another point that “Parent”
overlooks is that any inequali-
ties in development between a
child and his classmates tend
to become more marked with
the passing of time ; the older
the child is, the more difficult
it becomes for him to catch-up.
I am not an educationist,
although I speak from practi-
cal classroom experience. No
teacher worth his salt would
confine a child, repeating a
grade, to a mechanical repeti-
tion of work he has done
already. The teacher should
try to develop his knowledge
on the basis of that work. The
most satisfactory solution of
the problem seems to be pro-
vision of special classes for
advanced children, such as the
N.S.W. Opportunity C classes

Pervenire” might take note). —

a more-or-less harmless social
influence. It is rapidly becom-
ing a menace to public safety.
On the same Friday night in
Melbourne a few weeks ago
police were called to three
suburban picture-theatres to
quell disturbances caused by
gangs of bodgies.
One such disturbance took
place at our local theatre. The
theatre-manager caught a
youth making-off with valuable
hearing-aid equipment. He
detained him and rang the
police. Within minutes the
manager’s office was besieged
by bodgies, all going flat-ouc
vocally on behalf of the
detained lout. When the
police arrived the bodgies fled,
leaving behind an assortment
of weapons, including a sheath-
knife and a jagged bottle. In-
side the theatre the three front
rows of seats had been com-
pletely wrecked ; many more
seats in other rows had been
torn from their fastenings and
hurled to the floor, seat-cover-
ings had been slashed and a
brick had been thrown through
a plateglass window.
On the following night my
teenage son, in company with
two other 15-year-old young-
sters, was attacked by a mob of
five bodgies in a suburban
train. The attack was unpro-
voked by the youngsters, the
bodgie youths being urged to
“lay into those lads” by their
female companions. While the
three youngsters escaped serious
injury, they certainly got a
nasty surprise ; this experience
will undoubtedly make them
nervous about travelling at
night without adult protection.
It’s a sorry state of affairs
when neither theatres nor
trains are altogether safe for
young people. The obvious
remedial course seems to be to
crack down hard on bodgies
and their kind. — Wusslean

The Fishing Industry
Apparently Communist
China isn’t far behind Japan
in scenting the value of the
Australian fish-market (B.
11/3/’59).
Quick-frozen shrimps from
Shanghai are selling in at least
one grocery chain-store in
Sydney. Put-up in cellophane
containers with an attractive
label “Fresh Water Shrimps—
Peeled and Cooked,” they are
sold over the counter at 4s.
an Boz. packet. The label
states that the shrimps are
packed by “China National
Foodstuffs Corporation
Shanghai Branch.” Perhaps
they have other lines on the
Australian market as well.
No Pure Food Act is in force
in Communist China. Still, if
we in Australia can’t sell fresh
or quick-frozen shrimps or
prawns to the public at a
reasonable price we can't
blame them for buying im-
ported goods. Selimat
(N.S.W.).
The Small Bankrupt
Because the small inde-
pendent businessman has a
genuine, if not always under-
stood, niche in the economy,
the number who are going
bankrupt (B. 25/ 3/ ’59) is, to
say the least, disconcerting.
Their fate might well dis-
“Don't just sit there nagging—read me the instruction-book!"
courage others from starting in
what can be a useful com-
munity service and a personally
satisfying vocation.
Commonwealth figures for
the 1956-7 financial year show
that bankrupt businesses in-
eluded 121 general-store-
keepers 108 builders 72
carriers,' 68 garages, 52 painters,
37 restaurants and 36 hotels.

such as insufficient capital, ex-
cessive credit and failure to
keep proper books would
appear pretty obvious danger-
signs; yet the Registrar in
Bankruptcy says that these are
among the chief reasons why
so many founder.
There are other traps for the
inexperienced or poorly advised
—borrowing at high interest-
rates, unjustifiable speculation,
excessive spending on advertis-
ing, and selling too cheaply or
highly on turnover. Again,
many firms slump through fail-
ing to allow for depreciation to
build-up a reserve to meet
future commitments, or
through not providing for
increases in sales-tax.
Even organisations success-
fully launched or established
sometimes falter when faced
with heavy competition from
larger concerns, a change in
public demand for their pro-
ducts or a change in Govern-
ment policy—factors for which
proprietors can’t reasonably be
held responsible.
Establishing and maintaining
a worth-while venture is
seldom easy. There is no
reason why it should be, but
recognition of the “little man”
and his role in commerce and
industry might lead to the
removal of at least some of the
pitfalls that beset the paths of
would-be independent pro-
prietors.—Xavier (Vic.).
Handwriting
So they want to change the
style of handwriting in Tas-
manian schools. It might be of
service to future citizens if,
instead of tossing-out the exist-
ing script, an honest attempt
were made to teach children
to write it properly.
In my day instruction in
writing started with the neces-
sary posture of the body. Then
we discovered how to put the
hand into shape and position,
after which we were shown
how to hold the pen.
]We learnt how the nib holds
ink, and that fountain-pens
were dangerous things to
possess, as also were fancy
nibs and copying (“purple”)
pencils. And the writing of the
teachers on blackboards was
never a dreary scribble —it was
of the neat and polished
variety, always a good example
for kids to copy.
The late W. T. McCoy, one-
time inspector in N.S.W. and
Director of Education in S.A.
and Tas., often used to say
that the only visible sign a
child could give of attain-
ments in school was hand-
writing.
Tasmania doesn’t so much
need a different script as
proper teaching of the existing
one. —G. Sturrock (N.S.W.).
Third-party Insurance
One wonders how much
third-party insurance con-
tributes to the accident-rate.
It gives the reckless motorist
a feeling of undeserved finan-
cial security, and tends to spur
him to do careless things that
he wouldn’t do if he knew that,
financially, he was responsible.
Surely it would be a good
idea to make the motorist per-
sonally liable for the first £5OO,
and at the same time limit the
extent of any claim against a
motorist to £10,000? This
would mean a substantial
reduction in the premiums for
compulsory third-party in-
surance, thereby giving the
careful driver some reward
and at the same time helping
the unfortunate victim of some
motorist’s carelessness.
Five-hundred pounds might
not seem very much, but it is
an amount which most
motorists could pay. And it
is a large enough sum to induce
careful driving. —W.P. T.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
FARM MANAGEMENT
From “C. B. M.”
C*ince maintenance and
expansion of our rural
industries are essential to the
national economy, any sugges-
tion which may help towards
achieving this aim must be of
value. After many years as a
bank-manager in three States,
mostly in country branches,
and being myself raised on the
land, I put forward these
points, hoping they may be
constructive.
My comments are mainly for
the small farmer or grazier—-
the battler —who is the type
most eager to learn. My ideas
are gained from knowledge of
the financial affairs of success-
ful graziers, farmers and dairy-
men, observation of different
phases of their activities, and
discussion.
Of course, each area needs
different treatment, whether in
cultivation or in breeds of
stock or types of grain used
to meet the varying conditions
of climate, soil and conforma-
tion. Therefore I shall do no
more than deal with general
problems and make general
recommendations, leaving pro-
gressive farmers to apply these
principles to their own
situations.

should recognise that the land

trade from which they can

open spaces .”
retire. A doctor or a lawyer,
for instance, will set-off know-
ing that his profession is to be
his life’s work, so he will steer
his course accordingly. Men
on the land must do the same
if they want to be successful
and happy. Serving the land
is a calling which demands
initiative and enterprise and
offers in return a power of self-
expression not afforded by any
other livelihood.
The matter was put in a nut-
shell by a farmer I know who,
at 82, still lives on the property
where he was born: “My life
has been full and exciting, with
constant struggle against the
forces of nature —drought, fire
and flood—and a steady
change in methods from the
horse to this mechanised age.
My days have never been hum-
drum or monotonous.”
Always ready to help traders
and business-houses, financial
institutions have, in the past,
made only limited contribution
to the primary industries.
Perhaps it has been difficult
to do much, because men who
gain their living from the land
usually have independent
minds and don’t take kindly
to regimentation in manage-
ment or advice. However,
farmers, graziers and dairymen
are now taking more interest
in administration, and stock-
and-station agents, banks,
insurance companies and
manufacturers of machinery,
recognising that the interests
of all parties coincide, are now
employing highly qualified
staff to show the way, while
agriculturists are endeavoring
to put this knowledge to its
best use.
The still low price of wool,
and difficulties with other
land products, calls for
thought about the industry.
Increased raising of livestock,
fat-sheep, pigs and poultry
may, by a carefully balanced
spread of activity, keep revenue
coming in. It’s the old story
of not having all your eggs
in the same basket. This spread
of activities was the secret of
the success of the German
settlers in South Australia,
under hard and primitive con-
ditions.
There are many methods of
fodder-conservation, but for
the average farmer that of
stacking hay, sheaved or baled,
is probably best for economy
and ease of handling. If you
don’t own the plant to carry
out the project, contractors can
be engaged to do it. In all
farming ventures the capital-
cost of plant is important. If
it will not pay the small land-
owner to buy machinery, he
must adopt the next-best
course, and hire. Anyone can
carry out grandiose schemes,
given the necessary money, but
to the man on the land they
must be a paying proposition.
A farmer I knew in South
Australia had about 3000 acres,
which he used for grain and
sheep-raising. I noticed that,
while he had tractors and other
mechanical implements, he did
not possess a motor-lorry. He
said that all his deliveries to
and from railhead, about six
miles away, were done by
hauliers. He contended that,
taking into account capital-
outlay, repairs, insurance and
registration, this method paid
him better than owning a
lorry, and that, in addition,
all money paid-out for haulage
represented a full deduction for
income-tax.
Many inexpensive contri-
vances can be used for water-
conservation, such as saving all
the water that runs off houses
and sheds. Instead of letting
this drain down the road after
a heavy shower, cheaply-
constructed underground-tanks
could conserve it for use on the
kitchen-garden or to water a
patch of lucerne for the pigs
and fowls.
' The same forethought may
save losses from fire. I
remember how my father, for
instance, used to have his main
haystack near the stables, but
always built a reserve stack
about half-a-mile away. He
argued that, in the event of
fire, he would be unlikely to
lose both stacks.
Whether it’s a question of
soil-erosion, disease, or such
pests as rabbits, foxes and
mice, or birds, there is usually
a way of controlling the
damage at practically no cost,
given a little initiative and the
co-operation of neighboring
owners.

money out, as long as the pro-
gramme in your mind can be
carried on with reasonable
efficiency without outlay.
Take an interest in outside
affairs —sport, church, local-
government, etc. —but never
miss the main issue, which is
the progressive maintenance of
your property. Many good
men have ruined themselves by
becoming too involved in
public duties, outside their
own interests. It’s great to be
recognised as a good citizen,
but this doesn’t help when the
purse-strings tighten. Remem-
ber that your own holding
comprises a full-time job.
Learn to save time. The
foundation of good manage-
ment is a sound arrangement
of each day’s work. Every
man who has done well on the
land has been an early riser,
and this habit 'provides time
for effective planning for the
day ahead. It’s recognised that
more work can be done in the
morning than in the late after-
noon ; to substantiate my argu-
ment, 1 quGte the exercising of
racehorses, who do their best
work before most people are
stirring.
Financial arrangements
need to be made carefully.
Avoid borrowing unless it’s
essential ; but if it is necessary,
evolve some plan for system-
atic repayment, remembering
that big interest-payments can
be embarrassing in diffcult
times. Interest goes on adding-
up seven days a week, whether
conditions are good or bad.
Arrange your borrowing so
that it will be worthwhile for
you, and build a reputation as
a “good payer.”
To buy too much plant can
mean overcapitalisation.. It
may be all right to buy if cash
resources are available, but to
do so by hire-purchase or other
means is questionable wisdom.
The grounds for such a venture
must be strong, because
seasonal conditions can upset
the use of new machinery.
For instance, an expensive har-
vester bought one year on h.-p.
may not be needed the next
year because of drought—and
then the trouble starts. When
buying, stick to the well-
established makes of farm-
machinery—letting others be
the guinea-pigs for new ideas.
And if you've had to buy plant,
be careful with its main-
tenance. Even the poorest
farmer can build some sort of
shelter to cover plant. In the
mallee areas of South Aus-
tralia I’ve seen implements
sheltered by timber grown on
the land—at no cost to the
settler, except hard work.
Keep records of rainfall,
results of crops and wool-clips,
lambing-percentages or milk-
yield, but don’t become a
fanatic about this. Records
are useful in providing a spirit
of competition for you to do
better with your returns each
year, and also if you ever want
to sell the property.
If you are in the fortunate
position of having funds avail-
able for investment, place the
money on fixed-deposit or in
a savings-bank or bonds. Then
it's readily available in case of
need. Of all the companies
registered in Australia, about
90 per cent, never reach the
stage of paying a dividend, and
many farmers’ security-packets
contain only a lot of useless
scrip. The business of the man
on the land is farming, and my
advice is to stick to that and
leave surplus balances where
I’ve suggested.
Never become a stock-
dealer, gambling on the
market, the weather and the
future turn of prices. Some
men have done well at this
game ; but it needs a special
acumen, which is not every-
one's gift. If ample feed is
available, buy with a view to
shearing or fattening, but avoid
any other form of dealing in
stock, because it can land you
into much trouble.
If you have to buy more
land to set-up a son, try to
get it nearby. Then plant can
be loaned and physical assist-
ance can be given, which all
means savings. Land-quality
varies within a short distance,
so it’s worth a bit of study,
because the suitable method of
cultivation can be learned only
by experience. Never become
land-hungry.
In conclusion, I would
advise you to be friendly with
your neighbors and live in har-
mony with them. Above all,
aim for a comfortable home.
It’s the first thing that will keep
your wife and family happy
on the land and stop them
wanting you to drift back to
the city, as too many have
done.
To sum-up: with all the
modern discoveries, farming
still rests on its own original
foundations —hard work and
commonsense.
Strawberry-thrips
“Belar”: Growers should
now be watching for the straw-
berry-thrips ; an insect about
l/16in. long, it attacks both
leaves and fruit.
Injury to foliage shows when
the buds begin to appear—
young leaves change color,
becoming bluish and crimped.
When the fruit develops, rust
appears on its surface and
hundreds of tiny cracks show
on the skin. These become
larger as the crop matures,
while the size of the fruit is
reduced and it does not ripen
properly.
The thrips lays eggs inside
the leaves, and in a few days
larvae emerge and congregate
on leaves, flowers and young
fruit. Both adult thrips and
larvae scrape the plant and
take its juice. After two or
three weeks the larvae pupate
and six or seven days later
become full-grown insects,
which attack the plant again.
Damage caused by the thrips
is something like that done by
the red-spider, though the
spider only causes blue dis-
coloration close to the main
veins.
Nicotine-dusts and sprays
are effective. Use a 5 per cent,
nicotine-alkaloid dust, mixed
with hydrated lime to ensure
even distribution. For spray-
ing, mix 40 per cent, nico-
tine-sulphate with 21b. good
laundry-soap and 50gal. water.
Nicotine-alkaloid dust deteri-
orates if exposed and must be
kept in an airtight container.
Turnips
“Rutabaga”: Field-turnips
and swedes, both excellent
fodder for cattle, horses, sheep
and pigs, come from the same
stock and need the same kind
of treatment.
Seed them between February
and May, according to locality.
April and May are best on the
Darling Downs (Q.). but in
Victoria and parts of N.S.W.
February and March are pre-
ferred, while in colder districts
it*s necessary to sow in spring,
though this may encourage
attack by aphis. The crop does
best in deep, rich loam, rather
light in texture ; but good
yields can be expected from
most fertile soils, deeply and
thoroughly worked.
For fertiliser, apply about
3cwt. super, an acre. Rotted

farm-manure will supply
humus, and heavy dressings of
it should be ploughed-in.
Sown alone, about 31b. is
enough for an acre ; sow in
drills 3ft. apart, so that a
scarifier may be used between
the rows when seedlings are
well above the ground. When
the young plants are about 3in.
high, thin them out to 12in. If
the land is clean, no further
attention will be needed.
Phosphorus for Cattle
“Big Billy”: A hot, dry
summer often gives rise to
phosphorus-deficiency in cattle,
particularly in the beef-breeds.
Its most noticeable sign is the
way the beasts eat bones, dead
birds, scraps of old leather
and other rubbish.
First step is to vaccinate all
cattle against botolism; then
try to cure the deficiency. The
supplements recommended are
either superphosphate, sterilised
bonemeal and boneflour or
dicalcic-phosphate.
It’s best to topdress the
pasture with super., or dissolve
the super, in water and add it
to the feed. Use 51b. to lgal.,
and mix well. After it has
settled, a pint of this clear
solution is equal to 4oz. bone-
meal.
Sterilised bonemeal should
be fed at these rates: Adult
cattle and calves, jib. a week ;
cattle over 3001 b. weight, fib.
a week ; milking-cows, 21b. a
week. This supplement should
be added to the feed each day
or two.
As regards boneflour, lath-
is the equivalent of 21b. bone-
meal, while 11b. dicalcic-phos-
phate equals 21b. bonemeal.
Orchard Weedkillers
"“Sundowner”: Autumn is the
best time to apply chemical
weedkillers in orchards.
For channels and roadways
and around the farm, use
C.M.U. at 401 b. to 601 b. an
acre, with ylb. a chain extra for
a channel 6ft. wide. Stagnant
water in the channel will im-
prove the kill; but don’t use
this chemical in the orchard
itself.
Against couch-grass and
paspalum. dalapon at 53b. to
lOOgal., when growth begins in
the early summer, gives best
results. Follow-up sprays will
be needed ; use 31b. to lOOgal.
For general weed-control in
straw-mulch the most eco-
nomical spray is a mixture of
20gal. creosote with 90gal.
water, emulsified with lgal.
of special emulsifier (C.M. 496).
Don’t use any of these
chemicals, though, amongst
young trees. These are best
kept free from weeds by fre-
quent cultivation and hand-
hoeing.
Roughly, it will take about
300 gal. water to spray tall
grasses and weeds thoroughly,
but once they are controlled,
the rate can be reduced to
about 50gal. an acre.
Don’t put weedkiller through
an ordinary orchard-sprayer—
a lOOgal. spray-pump is the
thing to use.
Garden Week in
Melbourne
“M.G.S.”: It was possibly a
sure instinct which made the
Nurserymen’s Association
select autumn for the annual
exhibition of their art in the
Olympic Pool in Melbourne.
Contrary to popular opinion,
autumn is the best time for
color in the garden, beating
spring and summer hollow, as
most of the poets, from Keats
downwards, have observed.
The Pool, having been
drained of water, and the
nurserymen having packed it
with their products, one could
look down from the upper
benches on a sea of green, blue,
gold, crimson, ruby and orange
running through all the tonal
gamut, and as there was no
presiding deity to bring order
into the chaos it had all the
accidental variety of an artist's
palette.
From the point of view of
color few flowers are more
resplendent than Amelanchier
canadensis, whose foliage turns
from apricot to a rich red in
the autumn, and which has, in
addition, fruit that can be eaten.
Most of the dogwoods run it
a good second, and there is as
much variety of color in the
maples as in a crowd of
budgies.
The Persian witch-hazel,
with its strange flowers with
brown bracts and scarlet
stamens, and the elegant New
Zealander Nothofagus fusca,
which runs to copper and red
in autumn, are both wonders.
Everybody knows the liquid-
amhar, whose foliage turns
from green to gold, bronze and
black velvet, but some of the
rhuses are equally noteworthy.
The stems of Rhus typhena
laclanata are thick and woolly,
and its branches wander in all
directions, but its fernlike
leaves make up for its queer
appearance with their color,
while underneath Its suckers
make vivid splashes of crimson.
Somebody has planted a
scarlet vine (Vitis aiicante
houchet) in the vicinity of a
Lombardy poplar, and has
produced a pillar of gold
splashed with drops of blood
which makes the man-sculp-
tured pillar at the entrance
look as unimaginative as an
electric-light pole.
Golden weeping - willows,
golden elms and ashes,
Frcixinus raywoodii, the color
of a good claret, and Rhus
callous foffis alropurpurea are
other noble subjects. Inci-
dentally, it isn't the fault of the
nurserymen that they have to
describe their products .in dog-
Latia, so that the usually
beautiful common names are
apl to be forgotten, any more
than it is the doctors’ that they
have to do the same with
diseases.
Coming to the display of the
Cactus Society of Australia,
we are in a different world
altogether. This is a world of
nightmare shapes rather than
of color, though color is pro-
vided when, after years of
waiting, a plant like a spiked
Soccer-ball sends up a stick
which bursts into a blaze of
scarlet. Their fantastic formal
aberrations, permutations and
combinations are essentially,
no doubt, no more abnormal
and repellent than the acacias,
the eucalypts, the melaleucas,
the Casuarinas epacris, lepto-
spermums and callistemons
seemed to the early settlers.
Untouchables once, some of
them are Brahmins now, and
Schubert, of Noble Park, is
doing a good job in that direc-
tion.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(16/4/'59)
Queensland! is likely to Have only poor rains daring
May, apart from moderate falls in the north and south
coastal districts. Light to moderate rain may occur in
June, but good rains, above average, should fall in the
southern half of the State during July.
The coastal areas of N.S.W. should have moderate
rains in May, though rainfall may be poor elsewhere. Light
to moderate rains are likely in June, and moderate general
rains are indicated in July, with well-distributed rains for the
balance of the year.
Rainfall may be patchy in Victoria during May, apart
from moderate rain in the east-central and north-east
districts and in Gippsland. Fair general rains are indicated
in June, though rainfall may again be patchy and below
normal during July.
Reasonably good rains are indicated in the agricultural
areas of South Australia during May, though rainfall may
be light in the Murray Valley and poor in the interior.
Good rains should continue in the agricultural areas during
June.
The agricultural areas of Western Australia should
receive reasonably good rains in May, with best falls between
Perth and Albany. However, rainfall may be poor elsewhere.

Country Weather
“A.C.T.”: First of the
country weather - forecasting
services has been set-up for the
Riverina and s.-w. slopes of
N.S.W. It’s planned to extend
the service later to all States
and territories.
The Agricultural Forecast
Service will provide three fore-
casts daily, with reference to
the area served, giving general
weather - conditions, win d-
direction and -force, tempera-
tures, humidity and rainfall.
When possible, the expected
duration of weather favorable
for such activities as hay-
making, harvesting and fruit-
drying will be announced.
Also, four-day forecasts will
be broadcast on Mondays and
Thursdays . to enable farmers
to plan ahead —if reasonably
accurate and reliable predic-
tions can be made.
Pineapples in the N.T.
“Arafura”: In the red
laterite country here around
Darwin there are thousands of
acres of good, deep soil, almost
level, growing woollybutt,
coolibah, bloodwood and
ironwood, but capable of pro-
ducing up to 15 tons of pine-
apples to the acre.
That has been the yield at
the Berrimah Experiment
Farm (eight miles from
Darwin), run by the N.T.
Administration’s Plant Indus-
try Branch.
The plants—originally from
Queensland —belong mainly to
the Cayenne smooth-leaf
variety. They started bearing
at 15-months and needed less
fertiliser than in Queensland,
although they are grown on
richer soils there.
It costs £3OO an acre to
establish a plantation in the
N.T., including clearing and
land-preparation, and annual
costs are about £lOO an acre
for fertilisers, cultivation, etc.
In Queensland a return of £6OO
an acre would be considered
excellent. We need to sell our
pines here for only 4d. a pound
to reach that figure, because of
our higher yield—and prices
here seldom go below Is.
Many of us work our farms
part-time, and pineapples
appear to be ideal for this.
Water is the biggest problem,
but pines do not need as
much as crops like bananas,
which have been the favorite
sideline until now. Within a
12-mile radius of Darwin
there is good underground
water at 30ft. to 50ft., and
several bores have an output
of about 3000 gal. an hour.
Our rainfall is reliable, so it’s
only necessary to water pines
at monthly intervals during the
dry-season.
Now that a growers’ market
has been established in Dar-
win, with an executive which
can keep an eye on export
possibilities, pineapple-growing
should have a future here.
Eel-worm
“Malua”: The nematode, or
eel-worm, will soon be listed
as one of the No. 1 killers.
Infestation is particularly
serious in the U.S.A., and so
far biologists haven't found a
solution.
The order Nematoidea (all
completely parasitical) ranges
in size from the microscopic
eel-worm of plants to the
gigantic tape-worm, which
infests animals. One species,
Trichina spiralis, is the well-
known muscle-encyster of pigs
and men. But the eel-worm has
adapted itself to roots of
plants, encysting them and
forming large varicose-like
galls, which kill its host. The
only other plant-species 1 can
trace is the Anguillulidce, para-
sitic of wheat. This creature
pursues a cycle from ground
to ear, laying its eggs, and leav-
ing the young to do the damage
and go to ground for the next
crop. The breeding of hardier
strains has abolished this pest.
The nematode flourishes in
plants only in poor soil.
So, although apparently a new
worry, it has probably always
been in existence, finding
sustenance in natural soil
Now, with the rape of the land,
it is using plant-roots to con-
centrate its natural fodder.
To rid ourselves of this pest
we are told to let the land lie
fallow for two or three years,
or to fumigate the soil (this
means complete sterilisation,
like cutting off your foot to
cure your corns, and it’s a
prohibitively expensive process,
as well as a dead loss in pro-
duction).
However, there is a more
logical method for a small area,
which I have proved successful.
This is simple—enrich the soil.
Pull out and burn all infested
plants. Then lime the ground
and spread over it super, and all
kinds of manure and organic
refuse. Dig these in and water
well, then mulch the surface
heavily and keep it damp for
three or four months. The
plants put in after that lived
happily ever after. A body—
animal or vegetable—which is
well-fed and watered, automati-
cally resists disease.
Farm Hints
“C.A.A.”: Don't expect too
much from seaweed as a
fertiliser. It contains all the
minerals t>ut in such minute
quantities that its value is
overrated. However, it's an
excellent source of organic
matter in the garden.
“Norque”: When the tem-
perature rises above lOOdeg. F.
for several days on end,
kerosene-operated refrigerators
are liable to show their age,
however sound the door-
insulation. Soak a blanket in
a bucket of water and drape
it over the door from top to
bottom-edge, securing it over
the top with something
weighty. This will reduce the
internal temperature several
degrees and, when the day’s
a real scorcher, may help even
new models.

From “Yeldel”: The ship Star
of England (B. 18/2/’59) loaded
guano oft' the Chilean coast during
the 1850’s. She was one of the
vessels caught-up in regulations
imposed by the Chilean Govern-
ment, to the effect that on com-
pletion of loading all ships must
proceed some hundreds of miles
off-course to a predetermined port.
This had to be done in order to
get a clearance; but some of the
masters, including the master of
the Star of England, objected and
lefused.
Information Sought
What were the exploits and fate
of Harry Power, an early Victorian
bushranger ?
He was an Irishman who reached
Victoria at the beginning of the
gold-rush and took to horse-steal-
ing in 1855. He was apprehended,
sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment
and escaped in 1869, taking to the
bush in the Beechworth district.
Except for a short raid into N.S.W.
as far as Adelong he confined him-
self to this area, and was captured
in his camp near the head of the
King River on May 27, 1870. He
served a 15-year sentence, and was
engaged after his release to add
verisimilitude to the exhibition at
Melbourne of the so-called convict-
hulk Success. He was drowned in
the Murray on November 7, 1891.

Cannas are good for the position.
They stand hard conditions, are
quick growers and have blooms of

seed for 15mjn. in warm water
before sowing; root-clumps are
also obtainable from nurserymen.

Is the Japanese Trade Agreement
in the best interests of the Austra-
lian economy ?
At the time of the signing
of the agreement (July 6, 1957), the
Minister for Trade, Mr. McEwen,
described the agreement as a great
step forward in the Federal Govern-
ment’s policy of consolidating exist-
ing export-markets and in opening-
up assured new opportunities for
export. “If Australia were to
continue discriminatory and unfair
trade-policies towards Japanese
goods,” he continued, “especially in
the light of such a heavy adverse
trade-balance as Japan was running
with Australia, there would be a
constant risk of her resorting to
restrictive trade-practices and econo-
mic reprisals.” Japan is Australia’s
second-best customer and a major
support in the wool-market. Since
the agreement she has also been
buying increasing quantities of
wheat, sugar, barley and coal, as
well as dried vine-fruits, dried milk,
etc. Fears of possible undercutting
and swamping, and of damage to
Australian industry as a result, have
proved groundless; an advisory
authority has been appointed to
investigate any complaints of unfair
trading - practices by Japanese
exporters.

When was the Sydney Mining
Museum founded?
In 1875 rocks, fossils and other
specimens collected by C. S. Wil-
kinson, Geological Surveyor of
N.S.W., became the nucleus of a
collection of minerals forming an
adjunct of geological survey-work
carried out by the Mines Depart-
ment. The collection, to which
other specimens were added, was
first housed, in 1876, in a building
in Young Street, and from it
developed the present Mining
Museum. In 1879 the collection of
the Rev. W. B. Clarke was added
to the museum, which two years
later was transferred to the
Garden Palace, where the entire
collection was lost in the fire of
1882.
The collection was renewed, and
in 1886 was accommodated in
Macquarie Street, from where, in
1893, it was moved to a building
situated behind the present Sydney
Hospital and previously occupied
by the Technological Museum. The
building was opened to the public
in 1894; subsequently the collec-
tion was moved to the present
building in George Street North,
where it was opened in 1909. The
museum is enlarged and altered
periodically by exchanges and pur-
chases; it renders service to pros-
pectors, examines and identifies
specimens of rocks and ores and
conducts a general-inquiry bureau
in connection with the mining
industry. It also looks after the
preparing and collecting of minerals
for use as teaching-aids in schools
and other institutions.

Where is molybdenum found in
Australia ? Does Australia produce
much of it ?
Up to 1920, when world output
was much smaller than it later
became, Australia was the world’s
leading producer of molybdenum,
but subsequent production has been
relatively unimportant. Of a total
output of 2814 tons of 90 per cent,
concentrates to the end of 1954,
Queensland had provided 1685 tons,
N.S.W. 801 tons and Victoria 320
tons. During World War II the
possibilities of producing molyb-
denite from Australian sources
were fairly thoroughly investigated
both by Government departments
and-private interests, but the pros-
pect of large-scale production was
not encouraging.
Most of the molybdenite deposits
in Austraila have been shown to
occur in pipelike form. The prin-
cipal exception is the Yetholme
deposit in N.S.W., consisting of
disseminations of molybdenite in
an altered sedimentary rock
adjacent to a granite contact. The
Yetholme deposit possibly contains
800 tons of molybdenite, but pro-
duction could only be attained at
very high cost. The most important
of the other deposits are the pipes
at Everton (Vic.), which were worked
intermittently from 1917 to 1944.
The pipe at Wonbah (Q.) had been
developed to a depth of 250 ft. for
a production of 98 tons of concen-
trates when production ceased in
1943.

How to assemble a book-length
MS.?
Presuming you have used quarto
paper of good quality the sheets
should be numbered, arranged in
sequence and fastened securely
together. For a book or long MS.
divide into chapters or sections,
and fasten each separately; place
the whole in a cardboard box. If
posting, it’s best to register; avoid
as far as possible sending covering
letters. The question of royalties
and payments is largely a matter


for publisher and author, but there
are general fixed rules in British
Commonwealth countries. The
author is strofigly advised to send
all MSS. to a reliable literary agent,
who will protect all rights and
attend to details.

Are there any specific rules as to
the amount of alimony fo be paid
by a separated party ?
The court may order a husband
to pay alimony or maintenance to
his wife, both during the pendency
of the suit and/or permanently
after the granting of the decree.
The court acts on a broad principle
that alimony should be about one-
third of the husband’s income but
thlS t rule J f S J ery fleX l b!e ‘-
minatjon of the amount is influenced
by the wife’s separate means, by
the amount of the husband’s income
and by the general conduct of the
wife. Either party can apply to
have the amount of alimony
reviewed in the light of altered
circumstances.

Account of the wheat-industry in
Austialia from ns beginning.
Impossible to give a full account
here of the history of wheatgrow-
ing in Australia. A good summary
is given in the Australian Encyclo-
pcedia, which can be consulted at
public libraries. Here are a few
points: Wheat was sown by the
first settlers soon after they landed
at Sydney Cove in .1788, but, owing
to the unsuitability for wheat-
growing of coastal, inhabited
N.S.W., wheat was grown mainly
in Tasmania in early years; Tas-
mania exported wheat to the main-
land up till the middle of the
19th century. Rapid expansion
of wheatgrowing in Australia in the
last years of last century and the
first four decades of the present
century followed the large-scale use
of machinery, adoption of dry-
farming practices, use of fertilisers,
and evolution of improved varieties
of wheat. All the main varieties
of Australian wheat are sown in
autumn and harvested in spring,
Australian grain is typically soft
and white, though hard white
samples are grown. William Farrer
is the great name in Australian
wheat-breeding, but many other
experimenters, including Marshall,
Pye, Gordon, Waterhouse and
Soutter, have also produced new and
improved varieties. Australia ranks
about tenth in wheat-producing
countries in the world, but ranks
third or fourth as an exporter.

. ...R.K.: “The Golden Ghost” is
too long for us to cope with in
full, but here’s the pith of it: —•
The rain had eased by morning,
And only a drizzle fell,
The colt surveyed his surroundings,
From the base of Faulkner’s Hill.
To his left were the Bulla Mountains,
The Mandora on his right,
Behind him was the rugged road,
That he travelled all the night.
No signs of life appeared all day
As he climbed up Faulkner’s Hill,
The rain and wind had surely gone,
For the old gum-trees stood still.
The Golden Ghost they called him,
The word was soon round town,
Several parties made their way
To the hills to run him down.
He’d stand atop the Kublac Pass
And watch the riders come,
They’d get within a half-a-mile
Then the Ghost would make his ran.
We leave him now in the mountain scrub
In the midst of his mares of fire,
I hope someday that he’ll return
To the yards of the Lachlan high.

One of the most interesting mannequin-
parades Sydney has seen was staged
during the week by the third-year
students of the Occupational Therapy
Training Centre. The clothes chosen were
right up-to-the-minute in fashion and
were all suitable for physically-handi-
capped people.
Magyar sleeves, overblouses and culottes
were suggested for those who walk with
crutches, the value of the culottes being
that they guard against sudden gusts of
wind. Colored stockings, Bermuda socks
and Bermuda shorts with smart long-
sleeved blouses disguise scars and burns.
Velvet slacks with glamorous blouses can
be worn by an amputee for evening
wear. Clip-on earrings, button-through
dresses, poppit-necklets, slip-on bracelets
and wrist-watches are all easy-to-manipu-
late aids to fashion, while long-handled
umbrellas are a smart disguise for a
walking-stick. These are but a few of
the suggestions made by the students.
The parade, which also showed
specially-designed step-ins -and swimsuits
(zippered up both sides), was compered
by students Judith Harper and Ngaire
Hopkins and modelled by other third-
year students. Wheelchair-fashions were
shown by Miss Beryl Peck, and Miss
Hannah Wagner was another guest-
model. The students organised the show
with professional efficiency and were
warmly applauded by the audience of
doctors and occupational-therapists.

“Racing with Royalty.” On Thursday,
St. George's Day, the story of England
was told in song by Miss Evelyn
Gardiner, in poetry and prose by Mr.

A parade of high-fashion jewellery,
including a wrist-watch in diamonds and
rubies valued at £6500, followed the
luncheon held at the Australia Hotel to
aid the expenses of the Mater Hospital.
Minuet Ball. Mrs. Tom Bateman wel-
comed the guests-of-honor: Mrs. J. J.
Cahill, wife of the Premier, and Mrs.
P. H. Morton, wife of the Leader of the
Opposition. Other official guests included
Mrs. Hanne Fairfax, Mrs. J. Miculicic-
Rodd, Mrs. Adam Redler, Mrs. Norman
Rydge and Mrs. H. C. Coombs.
Julian Brewer, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. B. H. Brewer, of Balgowlah, whose
marriage to Bruce Campbell, of Mun-
derooie, Warren ( N.S.W. ), will take place
towards the end of the year, has fust
returned from a very interesting 10
months abroad. At the international
conference of ex-pupils of Sacred Heart
Convents throughout the world, held in
Brussels, she represented Australia, and
it was at this conference that she met
Miss Michiko Shoda, who has since been
married to the son of the Emperor of
Japan. Julian was' very impressed with
the personality of Miss Shoda, who was
representing the Sacred Heart Convent in
Tokyo, of which she had been the dux.
It is interesting to hear that the con-
ference this year is to be held in New
York, and that Australia is to be repre-
sented by Miss Mollie Cahill, also an
ex-pupil of the Convent of the Sacred
Heart, Rose Bay, and now headmistress
of Hornsby Girls’ High School. Julian’s

The Bush Book Club, which has been
sending books to lonely parts of the
country for the past 50 years, took a
bow and retired gracefully from service
at its final meeting during the week. Miss
Barbara Knox, the president, recalled the
history of the club with affection, and
said that, as public libraries were now
catering for country people, > it was
thought better that the club should go
out now “with a bang” rather than later
“with a whimper.”
Sir Kenneth Street, C.J., was to have
been the main speaker at the meeting, but
was stricken by Echo 6, so Mrs. John
Moore proposed the adoption of the
reports. Other speakers were Mrs. J. A.
Lander (retiring president of the C.W.A.),
Mrs. E. J. Turner (representing the
readers), Mrs. St. Clair Maclardy (whose
mother, Mrs. Aubrey Withers, was one
of the founders of the club) and Miss
Ruth Bedford, who suggested that those
people who lived in areas that were still
isolated should be “adopted” by members
and helped. Mrs. Kathleen Raymond,
secretary of the club, said that she had
the names and addresses of all w'ho still
needed books, and would supply them
to those interested.

MELBOURNE
The Anzac Day march through Mel-
bourne seemed more poignant than ever
this year. Perhaps it was the mental
flashback evoked by the sight of many
World War I nurses driving in cars to
the Shrine instead of marching as usual
with colleagues of the women’s Services,
who were led by Mrs. J. M. Shippen
formerly Matron Elizabeth Johns, war-
time matron for the Australian forces
in New Guinea. But if the lump in one’s
throat did threaten to become greater at
times, especially during the Edith Cavell
Memorial Service (when the first wreaths
were placed in remembrance of the older
nurses), it soon disappeared completely
in the cheerful and friendly atmosphere
of the Nurses’ Memorial Centre hall,
where reunions over afternoon-tea were
mostly accidental and always joyous.
Among those who thoroughly appre-
ciated the steaming-hot tea and home-
made cakes prdvided by members of the
Betty Jeffreys Auxiliary were 1914-18
veterans, former Navy matron Miss Ina
Laidlaw, and the former Matron-in-Chief
of R.A.A.F., Miss Margaret Lang, 0.8. E.
Nurses from the last war included Mrs.
M. Rossiter, Mrs. W. N. Tinsley (wife
of Brigadier Tinsley), Miss I. Plante and
Miss M. Macmillan, all of whom were
attached to the 2/7th A.G.H.
At the door auxiliary president Mrs.
J. Degenhardt was kept busy welcoming
new arrivals. She was helped by Miss
Huia Bristol and Miss B. Atwood, while
good work behind-scenes was shared by
Mrs. M. E. Morris, Misses K. and E.
Curwen-Walker, Miss Mary Snowball
and Miss M. Matthews. The money
raised by the auxiliary is used to help
maintain the centre, which was planned
in the grim environs of a prison-camp
by nursing-sisters to serve as a memorial
to their colleagues who had died. The
auxiliary is always glad to enrol new
members, and further information can
be had from Mrs. Degenhardt.

Glen Gordon, of Busselton (W.A.), who
arrived just in time to be chosen for the
role of W.A.C. corporal in the Melbourne
Little Theatre drama “Time Limit,”
which had its premiere on Friday, had
been voted the best actress in the South-
Western Drama Festival in her home
State. Glen, who is on a holiday-trip
around Australia and New Zealand,
was very thrilled to have the opportunity
to make a stage-appearance so soon after
her arrival in Melbourne. The play,
which has the Korean war as background,
concerns the defection of a U.S. major,
and has some bright comedy to relieve
its rather tense drama. The only other
woman in a cast of 18 is Benita Burke.
Most social functions these days are
planned to help a good cause, which
certainly adds an enjoyable spice of

desire of members of the Victorian
Ladies’ Bloodhorse Association to raise
money for veterinary research led to
historic Bolinda Vale, the property of Sir
Rupert and Lady Clarke, being thrown
open to the public on Sunday the
invitation was so eagerly accepted that
at times traffic between Melbourne and
Lancefield was held-up.
While their elders looked at the stud
cattle (which included the famous Santa
Gertrudis breed), and at the sheep
and horses, as well as the points
of interest inside the century-old
homestead, a magician kept the smaller
children happily interested, and a
seemily inexhaustible supply of hot-
pies, sweets, soft-drinks and afternoon-
tea added still further to the fund. Lady
Clarke is president of the association,
whose members include Mrs. lan Miller,
Mrs. A. A. Lord, Mrs. L. Buxton, Mrs.
W. K. Burnside, Mrs. Frank Watts and
many other woman-owners of racehorses.

knife, knocked him down, kicked him
about the face and head, spat at him,
struck him in the face with a belaying-
pin, arrested him at revolver-point,
handcuffed his hands behind his back,
threw him down the half-deck and kept
him there all day without food or
water.
A trifle irritated, to say the least, at
this treatment, Slater “wrested his
hands free” from his handcuffs (a
remarkable feat), crept on deck and
stole a revolver. But then, he said, he
thought better of whatever was in his
mind, threw the revolver overboard and
retreated below again. Whereupon the
captain and his officers and petty
officers all began to fire their revolvers
into the forecastle.
Failing to shoot him, Slater con-
tinued, Slocum got him on deck on a
false promise of forgiveness, knocked
him down again, handcuffed him with
two pairs of handcuffs, shackled his
ankles, wound a chain around his
throat and through his legs—“l had
then over 801 b. of chain on my body”
—and popped him into a section of the
lazaret 4ft. by 4ft. by sft. long. After
about 40 days in this box, fed on one
ship’s biscuit a day, Slater got hungry
and, catching one of the innumerable
rats that used to run over him, squeezed
it dead and ate it. He found out later,
he said, that “Captain Slocum used
to 1 pour melted butter or cheese on to
what remained of my clothes to attract
the rats.”
Slater himself seems to have been
tolerably- eccentric; but Captain
Slocum’s subsequent behavior, some of
it very unpleasant, suggests that the
wildest of these charges may not have
been without foundation. He had
Slater bound over to keep the peace in
Sydney; sailed on round the world to
fame; and eventually, when he set out
on another solitary voyage “to some
faraway place,” disappeared at sea. All
in all, the “Boston Globe” seems
rather to have understated the case
when it described him as “a kinky old
salt.” Teller’s biography of him makes
interesting but grimy reading.
New Zealand Memories
New Zealand’s history is so brief
that anyone like Sir Ernest Andrews
who is 86 has pretty well seen the lot
of it; and for a few pages in Eventful
Years (Pegasus Press) it almost looks
as if Sir Ernest is going to tell it all
again—or at least the whole Edward
Gibbon Wakefield story.
But this is only an essential prelude
to the story of his own parents and
grandparents who came out to Nelson
in the Maiy Ann in 1842 —one of the
New Zealand Company’s happier
voyages: very different from that of
the ship named Lloyds, on which 65
children died—and it is soon apparent
that it is the personal story of the
family rather than the full official his-
tory he is going to relate: how Grand-
father Andrews quarried the first stone
in the South Island and built himself
a flourmill; how, there being no horses
or bullocks available, they caught wild
goats and used a team of 16 or 18 of
them to plough the land, cart the wheat
and deliver the bread; how, riding from
Nelson to Christchurch, his father
heard a “heavy body” dashing through
the bush and, from its three-pronged
footprint next morning, deduced that
it was a moa; and how Sir Ernest him-
self, as a small boy at school in Ash-
burton, enjoyed the spectacle of a giant
of a man named Bob who, in spite of
having no feet and being accustomed
to walk on his knees, which were
protected by leather pads, was so
formidable a character in his cups that
he charged two policemen with a pitch-
fork and had to be lassoed with a long
rope before he would submit.
These are easy and unpretentious
memoirs, and they continue to provide
such lively anecdotes all the way
through. There was the time the young
Sir Ernest was jailed for rashly
robbing the policeman’s orchard; and
the time the Ashburton fire-brigade
turned out to extinguish the moon,
which they mistook for a bushfire; and
the time when, as a young school-
teacher in the country, he made friends
with a Maori who was a descendant of
Te Rauparaha, and, when he unthink-
ingly derided that old monster’s
memory, found himself hurled to the
ground and half-throttled.
As a schoolteacher —afterwards to
become a printer and businessman in
Christchurch—Sir Ernest kept on the
move over both islands. In Hawkes
Bay he saw the record flood of 1898,
when, amongst other strange happen-
ings, he observed a drowned cow
lying with its head on the pillow on
a bunk in a farmer’s cottage. In
Nelson, besides meeting a remarkable
non-swearing bullocky and a cat that
caught trout, he played a terrific game
of cricket, taking six wickets in the
first innings, making 114 runs (which
was well past the total of the opposing
side) and taking all ten wickets in the
second innings.
Sir Ernest was a representative
cricketer for Canterbury, South
Canterbury and Hawkes Bay; and was
mayor of Christchurch for nine years.
He has some kind things to say about
Melbourne, where he attended a
mayoral conference; and .some painful
things to say about the Barrier Reef.
JANUARY
In summer when the hills are blond
O dark-haired girl with wave-wet ankles
Bare your skin to the sun and to me.
All summer go brown, go salt by the sea.
O dark-haired girl stay close to me
As grass that shivers on the hill’s hot
flank
Or your spine that trembles under my
hand ;
The pale grass is dead, but not so the sea.
Across the paddocks stooks and bales
In separate civilisations stand
Like tribesmen s tents and townsmen’s
cities,
While a dark girl swims in distant seas.
The sun’s blond fire turns red and black,
A horrible army runs through hay
By flank of hill through hair of tree
And the ashes fall upon the sea.
Stook-tents, bale-cities all fall down
And fences keep the dead stock back.
O dark-haired girl, stay close to me,
All summer go brown, go salt by the sea.

The Mistress Cook: Peter Gray
(Faber). This succulent morsel con-
tains “one thousand classical recipes
from twelve countries and six cen-
turies,” such as are—or should be—
cookable by the average American
housewife. There is everything from
an omelette to a monkey’s ear (which,
alas, is a fungus), and the style is read-
able and amusing.

The Kingdom Under the Sea: Henri
Queffelec (Barker). A Breton fishing
captain strikes a rich bank of fish and
swears his crew to secrecy about it,
thinking that continued big catches will
win back his wife’s respect and break
the absurd stalemate into which their
marriage has fallen. The wife, not
caring much whether he is a success
or not, only resents being shut out of
his life at sea; the obvious secrecy
annoys her, and to break it she com-
promises herself with a stupid crew-
member. Out of the near-disaster that
follows, understanding grows between
the couple. Assured writing and exact

observation turn this rather common-
place story into a shrewd and absorb-
ing novel. It won a Grand Prix from
the Academie Francaise, so the occa-
sional crashing cliches and touches of
boys’-paper rhetoric are probably
faults of translation. The domestic
scenes are especially adroit, and there
are no traces of literary idealisation of
the sea and those who work it.

The Question of Being: Martin
Heidegger (Vision). Translated by
William Kluback and Jean T. Wilde,
with German and English texts, this
presents, for the first time in English,
Heidegger’s essay on “Concerning the
Line,” here retitled “The Question of
Being.” Prefaced by three critical
essays, the book is essentially an
attempt to reconcile Heidegger’s brand
of Existentialism, after his “demonic
honeymoon with the Nazis,” with
philosophies more hopeful and more
democratic.

The Easter Enigma: Michael Perry
(Faber). An examination of the facts
of the Resurrection from a Christian
viewpoint; partly to state the historical
evidence, chiefly to dismiss the supposi-
tion, sometimes advanced by psychical
researchers, that Christ’s resurrection
was comparable to other “"apparitions”
which can be attributed to telepathy:
i.e., that “the Risen Christ caused the
disciples to project an apparition of
Himself.” Incidental discussion brings
in such figures as St. Joseph of Coper-
tino and his remarkable levitations.
There is a foreword by Dr. Austin
Farrer.

Get Up and Go: Don White (Win-
gate). A pleasant, easygoing, super-
ficial travel-book —the young English
author walked round the world on £25.
His Australian adventures include
hitch-hiking across the Nullarbor in
heavy rain, finding his room-mate dead
on his first morning in Sydney and
coping with the other, more usual
perils of this terrible town —“The
northern suburbs are the home of the
deadly funnel-web spider while the
entire city suffers from plagues of bull-
ants, fleas and especially venomous
brown snakes.”

Welcome Good Friends: Sir Kenneth
Barnes (Peter Davies). Posthumous
autobiography of the director of the
Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. In
his childhood General Gordon played
soldiers with him; then he had more
serious soldiering in World War I; and
so to dramatic criticism; and so to
Pinero, Shaw, Ellen Terry, RADA and
the Vanbrugh Theatre. Lively enough,
especially when Shaw appears, but
more sober and solid than most
theatrical autobiographies, it is a story
of 50 years’ devotion to an ideal —“to
inspire and direct the training of those
who seek greatness on the stage.”

Our World and Its Beginnings:
Gustav Fochler-Hauke (Odhams).
Plentifully illustrated with the usual
delightful pictures of prehistoric
monsters prowling amongst swamps
and volcanoes, this large book deals
with astronomy, the formation of the
earth, geology and evolution. Infor-
mation is up-to-date, and the author
sees no irreconcilable conflict between
religion and evolution, provided the
Creation story is accepted symbolically,
Suitable either for older children or the
general reader.
