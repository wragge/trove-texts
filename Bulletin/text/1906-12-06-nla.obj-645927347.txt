The RED PAGE
THE AUSTRLIAN NOVEL.
Breathlessly the wide continent
waits for the coming of the Aus-
tralian novel—forgetting that the
American novel and the English
novel are not yet. Meantime, Australian
novels we have with us—good or indifferent
work-a-day novels that compare passing
well with the product of extra-territorial
authors. A consideration of six Australian
books—five of them novels—that have been
sent for review in the same fortnight should
indicate, however faintly, the direction in
which the stream of Australian literature is at
present flowing. Into what great ocean, or
what stagnant swamp, the current will at last
lead us, we may perhaps not guess; but at
least it is possible to note the direction of
that drift, to indicate the value and the
quality of the straws upon our sluggish
literary stream.
Of the six volumes that offer themselves
for comparison, four are from Australian
publishers, but one of these four publishers
has got his book printed abroad. It must
at once be said that two of the three
books printed in Australia are inferior
in appearancfe to those produced in
England. There is no reason why this should
be, except that the Australian publishers
do not know their own business. With
the growing competition of daintily pro-
duced American novels, chiefly remarkable
for the inanity and abnormal height of
their much-illustrated heroines, it might have
been worth a local publisher’s while, for in-
stance, to design an attractive cover to such a
book as Paterson’s An Outback Marriage.
In its present blue dress it looks more
liko a text-book than a readable novel ;
while De Boos’ Settler and Savage has
the brown dinginess, but not the dignity,
of a cheap dictionary. That these strictures
are callous but not unpatriotic is evident
from the Australian exception already
alluded to. Gordon and Gotch’s At the
“ Labor in Vain ” shows that the Australian
publisher can produce an attractive work
if he thinks it worth his while. _ To the
Melbourne printer and the Melbourne illus-
trator of this little grass-green book be
thanks. Typographically, the book, in its
effort to leaf) the commonplace, occasionally
becomes skittish ; but Ruby Lindsay’s illus-
trations show “ a coming-op disposition ” in
her work that it is pleasant to chronicle.
Her illustrations, though occasionally faulty
in drawing, and too reminiscent of the work
of her brothers, have beneath them a basic
sense of composition which more than com-
pensates. (
Happily for the purposes of our quest, one
of the volumes, Settler and Savage, chances
to be a re-issue of a novel published in Aus-
tralia in 1867, under the title of Fifty Years
Ago. This work of the late Charles de
Boos has almost the appearance of a
valuable find—a fossil footprint on the
mud of Time. It is the Australian
novel in file making, the Australian novel,
with difficulty acclimatising itself upon
Australian soil, tardily shaking off the
influences of over-seas. It is Fenimore
Cooper in the back-blocks. Through these
pages of breathless adventure stalks the
Australian “ black-skin,” wearing with
dignity the pride, the stoicism and
the magnanimity of the red-skin of
romance. Here is the intrepid white
settler who swears a dreadful vengeance,
and • grimly wreaks it. The story
reads almost like the genesis of the
modern melodrama ; the characters have
an annoying propensity for saving each
other’s lives upon the least pretext; and
the habit so grows upon the hero and
his intended victim that occasionally these
two save each other’s lives. The other faults
of the book—its stilted style, and the
impossible formality of the dialogue-
are due solely i o the passage of
time. The surprising thing is that at
this date the book should yet remain read-
able. De Boos, despite bis environment
and his period, manfully cleared the way for
the writers of this more hopeful time.
Turning to the moderns, what have we
gained ? There is an advance, moderate,
yet distinct, in the works of Paterson,
Kathleen Watson, Bertha Shelley.
None of these writers aim very high,
but all in a measure reach their
goal. An Outback Marriage , by A. B.
Paterson, is a cheerful story, told with
the careless ease and the unassuming
casualness that a reader would naturally
associate with the author of The Man from
Snowy River. It is a fine, cheerful, healthy,
matter-of-fact yarn that could not have been
written anywhere but in Australia, nor by
anyone not an Australian. The structure of
the story, commonplace at its best, bears
signs of tinkering ; the plot is used simply
as a clothes-horse upon which to hang
a number of delightful and exciting inci-
dents. The characters differ little from
the stock puppets out of the literary trades-
man’s box ; but in a novel of adventure the
characters have not time to wait to get their
portraits minutely painted. They have to
be off to steal somebody’s sheep, or
fight somebody, or rescue a girl from
drowning, or cut out wild cattle from
the scrub, or search for the missing heir,
or fall down a well. And Paterson’s
characters do all this witli a breezy zest that
is infectious. In a few swift strokes lie gives
us the atmosphere of out-back.
The sheep themselves (he cheerfully explains)
seem always in league against their owners.
Merinos, though apparently estimable animals,
are in reality dangerous monomaniacs, whose
sole desire is to ruin the man who owns
them. Their object is to die, and to do
so with as much trouble to their owners
as they possibly can. They die in the droughts,
when the grass, roasted to a dull white by
the sun, comes out by the roots and blows
about the bare paddocks; they die in the wet,
when the long grass in the sodden gullies breeds
“fluke” and “ bottle ” and all sorts of hideous
complaints. They get burnt in bush tires from
sheey malice, refusing to run in any given direction,
but charging round and round in a ring till they
are all calcined! They get drowned bv refusing
to leave flooded country, though hunted with
frenzied earnestness.
It is in the incidentals that Paterson
succeeds. The adventure of Red Mick and
his sheep dogs is stirringly told ; and
whether the heroes find themselves rounding
up cattle or shooting buffaloes, or kitting
every head they see, or falling down a well,
they do it with a convincing l and light-
hearted vigor that pleasantly stirs the pulse.
Paterson’s method he naively explains to the
reader :—•
And now, after hauling the reader pretty well
all over Australia—from mountain-station to out-
back holding, from cattle-camp to buffalo run—
we must ask him to take a seat in the Supreme
Court at Sydney.
So he hauls us to a “push” ball—just
because the incident, which has nothing to
do with the story, appeals to him as good
“ copy.” Yet the ingenuousness of the
method disarms criticism : one suspects that
the author does riot imagine his book a
masterpiece. Yet it has its niche—a cheer-
ful Australian yayn lightly told.
<#
Sundered by a hemisphere of feeling,
alien in its locale and foreign in its aspira-
tions, Kathleen Watson’s The G-aiety of
Fatma has as its sole connecting link
with Paterson’s book the same careless
cheerfulness. Fatma is nierely the typical
woman’s novel for the English book-
market ; it comes into this article almost
by courtesy : it strangely* happens that it
has been written by an Australian. It is a
tale, as light as air, and as impalpable, of
a Franco-Arab girl in the little Algerian
seaport of Cherchel.
A place of sunshine, delicate ruins, and frag-
ments of old-time glories, beautiful seas and
skies, heavenly gardens, groves of lemon, olive,
palm.
And, we may add, of good, exiled English
noblemen, and wicked English noblemen in
white yachts, and snatches of French, and
lavish feminine descriptions of Fatma’s
frocks and Fatma’s sandals and—especially
—Fatma’s smile.
The bright, inscrutable smile which mystified
while it allured, the smile which in after-days
became the talk, the wonder, the desire of the
men and women of London’s most gorgeous and
exclusive houses, the marvellous smile that came
so slowly, that quivered with such a delicate irra-
diation, that said at once so little or so much,
provoking to mirth or pathos as it chose, but con-
quering ever, its shining way strewn with the
hosts of the slain...etc., etc,
But the book will be read ; despite the
melodramatic plot and its stage “curtain,”
the story is infected' with the gaiety of its
charming heroine, and the style is almost
caressingly feminine. Fatma is sufficiently
improbable to be very like a woman. Kathleen
Watson has acquired the trick that should
bring her into the market of popularity.
Only . .". Fatma does not help us on our
quest for the Australian novel ; she is. a mere
irresponsible little straw drifting Imp-hazard
into dear little giddy eddies of her own.
It seems as if ultimately something might
be done with Harold Hansel], author of At
the “ Labor in Fain,” a collection of stories
good and bad, and reflections that are occa-
sionally epigrammatic and frequently dull.
Hansell can tell a good story with artistic
conciseness ; his yarn of the hopeful mariner
is delightful, its ending worth all the elaborate
apothegms in the book. But Hansell needs
pruning, a severe self-discipline. Exaggera-
tion is not humor ; and yet he has the gift.
He will find himself—in time.
' J*
Still hopefully. let us open Underbid by
Mrs. Norman Shelley, of Sydney. And here
is a surprisingly interesting story built up,
alas, out of one monstrous improbability. A
dying girl confides her illegitimate baby to a
girl friend, Enderby Lane, under a seal of
secrecy, death coming before she can tell
Enderby the name of its father. The sup-
posed seducer of the dead girl, who is now
in love with Enderby, finds her in the
country the same night with the child —his
child—in her arms ; and knowing nothing of
the other girl’s death, nor, indeed, of the
child, believes Enderby to be its mother.
The girl is prevented from denying the
man’s accusation by her pledge not to ex-
pose the secret and the shame of her dead
friend. So, stunned by the encounter, she
remains passive while the man, under the
conviction that this is the only way to save
her reputation, forces her to marry him next
day. That is the tremendous situation—
the husband and girl-wife loving each other,
yet eternally divided by the child which he
is convinced is hers, and which the reader
knows—or is led to believe—is his. (The
fact that ultimately the reader learns that the
author has wilfully misled him does not
diminish the dramatic power of the situation.)
The story, with its cunningly arranged
scenes, its simple, powerful theme, its de-
liberate use of coincidences, its surprising
climax, seems almost as if meant for the
stage. The credulity which an audience
brings with it to the drama is neces-
sary for the reader of this dramatic tale.
But Mrs. fSiielley has clothed the awkward-
ness of her improbable plot with a dainty
garment. The characters of Enderby and of
the little group of old women are delightfully
and delicately outlined. The atmosphere is
one strangely new to Australian novels. The
old women with their surface hostilities and
then talk of graves are depicted, as it were,
in faded tints ; about them faintly hovers
the charm of all old and gentle things.
Their humor is dimly delightful, their pathos
real because unforced. And Enderby herself
is studied with a woman s insight ; but the
men suffer from pourtrayal by a woman.
They speak like this—in tne feminine key :
“And yet it should be the aim of all to marry
and most men would wish to see that tender joy
on the worn .in’s face as she holds the delicate breast
for her child to suckle. How tenderly be would
feel towards her in seeing the blue veins showing
through the delicate skin in such service, the
sweet eyes raised to his in response to the smile
on her master’s face for we are masters,
Enderby, and, strong or weak, competent or in-
competent, must remain so till the end.”-,
Enderby displays real constructive power,
much psychological insight, and a capacity
for interesting the reader, despite the im-
probable basis of the plot. This book
suggests, nay, promises more matured work
to follow. At least this lonely straw upon
the literary stream is not aimlessly drifting.
There is room and need in Australia for the
little current in which it has been caught.
Another straw caught in a flow whose direc-
tion and motion we can clearly see is The
Wilderness, by T. B. Clegg, of Sydney.
This book conforms to all the canons of the
most strongly marked type of Australian
novels—the novels of which Randolph
Bedford’s The Snare of Strength may be
taken as a prototype. Bedford’s earlier
work, True Eyes and the Whirlwind , set
the formula of the type ; but his second
novel did no more than keep in the
grooves of the simple principles laid
down. There was no development, no
growth ; the framework gaped unclothed.
In both these there is an undeniable power
of phrase, a swift painting of an unforget-
table picture, an elan and a virility
that swings the reader breathless, protest-
ing, to the end. His novels are a heap of
brilliant tesserae which he’is too impatient) to
build into an artistic mosaic. Such is the type,
and in a _measure-both George Lancaster’s
A Spur to Smite and Clegg’s The Wilderness
conform to the formula. Indeed, A Spur
to Smite might have been written by Bed-
ford ; the astonishing thing is that this book
—in no sense an imitation, yet in its charac-
teristics so alike—was written by a woman.
It looks, then, as if at least one type of novel
is being slowly evolved that may be claimed
—or deplored—as typically Australian. The
type may be one of limited possibilities, but
its probable influence, good or bad, upon
Australian literature cannot be overlooked.
The Wilderness, while retaining the charac-
teristics of the Bedford-Lancaster school,
displays a more matured constructive power,
it grips a bigger handful of characters and
treats them with a, more subtle psychology.
The plot is a study of the far-reaching effects
of one sin—the’ ruin of a boy’s family by a
business-man, who plays the commercial gan
upon the approved commercial principle
The youth who revenges his great wrong 1
a wrong still greater, the business man wl
see his principles grow to a fearful harvest
in his son—each learn the grim lesson of tl
law that com produces corn, tares con
forth from tares. The scheme is big in coi
ception, the execution scrappy. The stor
flickers from scene to scene with diseor
certing gaps of darkness in a manner mac
cleningly cinematographic. Yet the atmos
phere of the scenes, all set in Australia,
faithfully indicated. Equally well don
is the dainty opening scene with it
unobtrusive pathos, and the grim horr<
of the kanaka hospital in the cane
fields, life upon the out-back section, ant
the bursting of the boom in Golde
City. But the author has built bis boo
upon the fallacy that life has no compens;
tjgns ; he forgets that it is kindly Nature’
way in the course of the generations out o
evil to produce some good. He sees life as
tragedy unrelieved, a gloom unliglitened
The sin must be traced to its bitter end
the grim revenge of Nature logically con
sum mated. So too soon the author let.
us observe the set of the tide towards
tragedy ; we feel that he will let nothing
stand in the way of his piling up of horrors
The work might have been written by ;
medical man. The description of the in
sanity of Geoffrey Merton, for instance, is
accurate ; but the general subject of this
mental disease could be more authoritatively
treated in a medical text-book. Mr. Clegg
might reflect that that is where the readei
might prefer to find it.
jt
Thus it is chiefly from a medical point ol
view that the revenge taken by the doctor
is of interest. It is the murder, not of a
man’s body, but of his personality. By
means of a rare poison the doctor determines
to blot out the memory of his victim, Merton
the financial genius.
That this ego took its quality, its color, so to
speak, from the physical life of man, and the
exterior forces that played on it, he had no doubt.
Experiment had made it clear that it was so.
What if he could use Merton thus! Merton the
outcast, Merton the hewer of wood, the drawer of
water, the past blanked o(it—whatanew Merton to
evolve ! What a revenge ! Men had toiled and
sweated for him, been,broken to make his fortune.
Let him bear the yoke be had placed on others !
. . . Well, the opportunity had come. He entered
the room where Merton lay, a shaded light by his
bedside. He turned the shade so that the light
could fall upon the face. It was beaded with
sweat. Consciousness would return for a time at
least—and after, he would make his venture into
the Unknown.
The experiment is successful, and a
kanaka boy’s body buried in the coffin of
Merton ; while that poor thing slowly
recovers his health, but not the memory of
his personality.
One side of the face was out of all keeping with
the other, the corner of the mouth sagging, the
lid of the eye half-closed. Rocldeigh had severed
the facial nerve to divert recognition. The opera-
tion left only a minute incision in the flesh, but
wrought a complete, a repulsive, change.
The Wilderness, even by such devices as
these, retains the reader’s interest through-
out ; and the author shows a constructive
ability rare among Australian novelists.
With a simpler theme, a little less pathology,
and an ampler faith in life, T. B. Clegg may
produce a fine Australian novel. He has
not the virility of Bedford or Lancaster, but
he has a more capable grasp of his tech-
nique ; he lumbers along where they gallop,
yet, in the end, he reaches more solid
ground. To him we may look to clothe the
skeleton of the type wit.i an enduring flesh.
Only, Clegg must write with a p%n and not
a lancet.
Yes, The Wilderness and Enderby are
straws whose drift will repay watching.

When You Visit London!
Meet Your Friends and
Fellow Australasians at
Stewart Dawson’s,

ONE of the sights of London, and one you should not miss, is the magnificent six-story building just erected by STEWART DAWSON & CO.
for the better reception of the many visitors to London from Australia. It is miles ahead of any building anywhere devoted to the Jewellery
business. Fireproof throughout, it has superb Shipping Offices for the prompt despatch to our Australian and New Zealand Stores of all the new
things as they appear. There are Three Showrooms, Home Offices, Reception Rooms, Two Electric Lifts, Strong Rooms, and last, but by no means
the least, a Bureau where you can write your letters and meet your friends in comfort, or have a glance at the Australian and New Zealand papers

will be cheerfully supplied, and Mr. Dawson will always be pleased to see any one personally if they so desire. j


Whjl<} thin hair and baldness are
undesirable for men, they are vastly
more so for women. Nothing adds
more to the adornment of women
than rich, heavy, flowing tresses.
The hair is too valuable to allow it
to suffer from neglect. So just as
soon as you notice that your hair is
coming out you should use
filler's
flair Vigor
isr.r..»
It checks falling of
the hair promptly.
This feature of Ayer’s
Hair Vigor is now
recognized as most
marked, and has
brought to this prep-
aration a world-wide
reputation.
You cannot possi-
bly have a splendid
head of hair when the
scalp is covered with
dandruff. We urge
upon all who are in
any way troubled
with dandruff to be-
gin the use of Ayer’s
Hair Vigor at once.
Do not be deceived
by cheap imitations which will only
disappoint you. Make sure you get
AYER’S Ilair Vigor.

Automatic vSPRAY
PATENTED UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION
IN ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.
THE man who makes two blades of grass grow where one
grew before is recognised as a Public Benefactor. 1 The
TYREE SPRAY will do more than this; it will
enable you to grow two sheep where one grew before, as it
can be used as a rabbit destroyer. It will double the fruit
crop, as it enables anyone to keep down the insect pests. It
will double the output of poultry and eggs for the same
reason. It can be used for white-washing, painting, spray-
ing, disinfecting, fire extinguishing, cleaning windows, kalso-
mining, washing horses, traps, houses, and a number of
other uses too numerous to mention.
The TYREE SPRAY works at a cost of one
half penny per hour.

Summer Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Summer Girl.
When the heat-haze shakes and quivers, and the
gusty hot winds whirl,
And the pavement burns beneath your blistering
feet,
A vision most refreshing is the cool-clad Summer
Girl
Softly drifting like a sea breeze down the street.
She reminds you of some spray-splashed isle, set
in a sunlit sea,
Secure from burning winds and scorching heat —
With her chiffon billows round her and the
foamy lingerie
That swirls and surges round her dainty feet.
When your collar chafes and crinkles till you feel
inclined to pray,
Floating past you in her airiness she goes.
Filmy draperies caught round her to eoquettishly
display
Lissom limbs and glimpses rare of fretwork hose.
While you curse the heat and worry, and your
eyeballs swell and ache,
About her an Antarctic coolness lies,
She’s a beauteous mist-wraith straying from some
distant southern lake,
Or a chiffon-clouded sprite from Paradise.
0, were I some princely potentate, or multi-
millionaire
(I’m a city clerk, at thirty bob a week),
I would lease some lotus-island, and the Summer
Girl so fair
And I no more this dusty world would seek.
Then the earth might shrink or shrivel, and the
sun might burst and swell,
All in vain for us the last trump would be blown ;
I would simply wire this message—“ Don’t you
bother, Gabriel;
Summer Girl and I’ve a heaven of our own.”
VIC.
ROBERT CRAWFORD.
Mary Jane.
Now Summer’s with us once again,
And verdant Youth at Love’s alarm
Doth seek him out a Mary Jane,
And hang her proudly on his arm.
And Mary Jane of common stock,
With bliss intoxicated quite.
Giggles for long hours by the clock,
And slaps at him in sheer delight.
I wandered down a leafy lane,
And quizzed the couples as they passed,
And each succeeding Mary Jane
Was singularly like the last.
Ah ! white and pink and blue chiffon,
And flashing eyes, and swinging hips,
And If you dare I ” and “ You go on ! ”
And handkerchiefs to cherry lips.
It makes one think of days long gone,
When we were young, and joined the dance,
And when as buds we bloomed upon
That hardy annual, old Romance.
The world swings gently through the years,
Regardless of our rights and wrongs ;
But somehow always it appears
To swing in time to cradle songs.
To Her the glory of it all,
While she has breath she’ll not refrain,
Mother of Nations since the Fall !
Enthusiastic Mary Jane !

Dusk.
It is growing dark ; by the dull belar
There climbs and climbs ever a white-faced star
Like the dwindled soul of some long-dead moon,
Whose reflex once laughed in the reed lagoon.
It is growing dark ; o’er the open plain
Fades the last spilled red of the sunset’s stain,
And where Night, low crouched, on the ranges
springs
Comes the sudden whirr of a wild bird’s wings.
It is growing dark ; where the brown boat drifts
Through the drooping greens.of the willow rifts
Winding mists steal up from the couch of day,
Where the red and gold have alike turned grey.
It is growing dark ; at the branding yard,
Where the moist, black soil is beaten hard,
And the bark-stripped gums stand stiff and
tall,
Comes the organ note of the cattle call.
It is growing dark; in the station home,
Where the yucca blooms are like drifted foam,
And the trees bend low to the fondling night,
There strikes o’er the grasses a shaft of light.
It is growing dark ; we must turn the boat
Shorewards now, where the lilies float,
And we must not pause at the landing-place—
The heart sees much when night hides the face !
It is growing dark—and ’twere best to go
Back to prudent ways and the lamplight’s glow,
Lest, while blushing Day to Night’s dusk arms
slips,
Warm lips in the dark should find warmer lips !
It is growing dark; lift the dripping oar;
A long, rippling sweep—and we make the shore.
A brief hand-clasp, then your dress gleams white
On the curving path as we say “ Good night! ”

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin ivould oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by talcing some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor ,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

THE FORGOTTEN CANDIDATE.
In these last days beicro the Federal election The
Bulletin would fain put in a word for an almost
forgotten candidate—AUSTßALlA. Australia
is our country; the only one we have, the only
one we ever will have. It represents, in a sense,
the last chance of the white race; if Australia
becomes black or brown or yellow or black-and-
tan, there is-no other place on earth where a new
and purely white community can be reared except
by the inconceivable expedient of extirpating the
colored races already in possession. Australia
and Canada represent the final hope of the
British empire, and Australia does that even
more than Canada, which the United States
ls slowly eating up by arbitration, and
which seems likely to be all consumed
by-and-bye. The whole secret of the empire’s
strength lies in its white peoples; they
have not only to hold the citadel against millions
of white enemies, but against countless millions
of discontented black subjects. But Britain
itself—that valiant little speck in the North Sea
can’t hold enough white men to garrison the
empire against the increasing dangers outside,
and unless a great reinforcement of white citizens
grows up in the only white dependencies which
Britain possesses the prospect is dreary in the
extreme. These are good reasons why Australia
should look to itself with special anxiety. And
there are others. This country is, in a sense, the
most marvellous episode in all history, and is
worth preserving on that account. It is, so far as
we know, the one continent, since records began,
which has been occupied practically by one race,
speaking one language, and existing under one
Government. And now the marvellous episode is
m a fair way to be spoiled, and the hope of the
white races to be destroyed, and the prospective
prop of the empire is likely to double up before it
really becomes a prop. Australia, after lying quiet
for a century in the most unruffled backwash of his-
tory, suddenly finds that its peaceful sea has become
the scene of one of the most disastrous naval
battles known for two centuries; that on the
shores of that sea has been fought the most awful
land engagement recorded for over 1400 years ;
and that we are in the front rank of tumult
instead of being in the rear. Surely if there is
any candidate who should be thought of now it is
Australia.
• *. * *
But amid the swarming of small, ant-like candi-
dates, and the clatter of silly, over-dressed women,
and the frenzy of fat men, and the buzz of Kelly’s
motor car, and the tearing across the land-
scape of Reid’s dog, and all the rest of the
babel of sounds, who speaks of Australia, and
where is the Australian party to be found?
“We should frankly trust to Britain for our
defence” is the catchword of Toryism—old, un-
patriotic, inept, hating to be bustled at its large
dinner, or to he disturbed by ominous spectres
looking in a,t the window of its club. Canada
trusts to Britain for its defence, and Canada is
being abandoned piece by piece for peace
sake. It used to be reckoned that British
America on its western coast extended south-
ward till it joined on to Mexico, but it
certainly does nothing of the sort now, and only
the other day much of the remnant of its Pacific
coast went to the United States in a “fake”
arbitration. Newfoundland also trusts to Britain
for its defence, and, a week or two ago, a few
British war vessels appeared on its coast to make
fishing regulations which would pacify the Yankee
fishermen, and to overrule the Acts of the New-
foundland Legislature in the process. Some
day, in all probability, a similar British fleet
will appear off our coast to make regula-
tions for the free admission of Japanese and
Chinamen, and then our house of cards will
fall about our ears. That is what will almost
certainly happen if we remain the weak, defence-
less community that we are. There is little or no
appreciation in England of the White Australia
policy. Britain, with no great Asiatic or negro
danger at its own door, doesn’t understand what
that danger is. It prefers black dependencies,
governed from London, available to be exploited
by London syndicates, and affording good billets
and jobs and pickings for the younger sons of the
British aristocracy, to white dependencies that
govern themselves and do little for England—
which thinks it is the empire—beyond adding an
unprofitable splash of red to the map. It is 100
to one that Britain —which has only fought one
serious cam pa .. .or half-a-century, and that a
campaign to f . Chinese labor on a white man’s
Government' ould not take up arms to defend
the White Australia policy. If it even comes to
look like a choice between waging war against
Japan, with all the complications that might follow,
and forcing Australia to open its gates to Asiatic
immigrants, the British guns are much more likely
to be pointed at us than at our enemy—that is, if
Australia remains the thinly-peopled, unarmed con-
tinent it is. This is just what would probably have
happened to Canada if it hadn’t given way to the
United States over the Alaska boundary, and
what will happen to Newfoundland if it objects
to having its fishing laws overridden in the United
States’ interests by British warships.
* * •» *
After all, why should we expect the purely
commercial Britain of to-day to fight for our
White Australia policy ? It is a splendid ideal,
but it is our ideal—not Britain’s. It is an ideal
that is worth maintaining even at imminent
hazard of ruin, but it is a fruitful source of
quarrels with our Asiatic neighbors, and if
we make no preparation to bear a share of
the burden of these quarrels, it is not likely
that Britain will carry the whole responsibility.
Britain will judge the importance of the White
Australia principle by the amount which we are
willing to sacrifice for it. The White Australia
doctrine is practically a throwing down of the
gauntlet to Asia, and Australia backs its opinion
in the matter with an antiquated gunboat, a
proposal by a senile Defence Minister to estab-
lish a workshop for the making of a few rifle-
barrels, and a subsid 1 ' the navy of the greatest
nigger Power m oarth. That is not the
way to inspire ?_>ritain with respect for a great
national principle. Britain would probably stake
its whole existence, if need be, on the maintenance
of the White Australia policy if Australia could
show such an army and navy as would make
its cordial friendship seem worth retaining
on plain business principles. An ideal with
100,000 rifles behind it is very different
from an ideal that is going about naked.
Again, Britain would probably stake its existence,
if necessary, on the maintenance of the White Aus-
tralia policy if this land had such an army and
navy that the MaCountry couldn’t force us to open
our doors to Asia without making such a slaughter
of the people of its own race as would revolt
British public sentiment. But if it seemed
possible to coerce this utterly defenceless land
into reversing its policy without killing anybody
in the process, the chances are that Britain would
sooner coerce Australia cheaply than coerce Japan
at great expense.

And there are even worse possibilities than this.
There is the possibility of Britain being engaged
in a struggle for existence—Germany professes to
fully intend that it shall engage in such
a struggle within the next few years—and
of Japan, as Britain’s ally, occupying Aus-
tralia in a ; friendly way, to protect us against
Britain’s opponent, because we are too
miserably unprepared to be safe without Japanese
protection. The friendly Jap would regulate
our affairs in a friendly way while he was here,
would suppress “disorder,” would open the doors
to Jap settlers, and would make us feel, for an
indefinite period, all the blessings of Asiatic
assistance. And there is the fourth danger that
Britain may one day decide that a country which
adds nothing of importance to the defensive
power of the empire is a mere vanity—the vanity of
a red splash on the map—and may resolve that it
is good enough for Australia to be part of the
empire while its inclusion costs nothing, but that
if it threatens to cost anything it had better go.
In other words, Britain may conclude that if the
White Australia policy is likely to make trouble,
even the expense of coercing Australia into nigger
labor views isn’t worth while, and may
just retire from the scene. Britain has had
such moods before. It has had many spasms
of intense land-grabbing, but it has also
had one or two spasms when it threat-
ened to retire from the colonisation business
altogether. It even went so far, half-a-
century ago, as to drive the Orange Free State out
of the empire when that locality didn’t want to
leave, and then, in later years, it fought a bloody
war to recapture it when it didn’t want to be
recaptured.
* • • *
There are many possibilities ahead, and if Aus-
tralia doesn’t take warning, and put its house in
order, it deserves whatever may happen to it.
This country wants almost every essential of de-
fence, but, first of all, it wants white men —the
raw material of defence. That is the same thing
as saying that it wants plenty of available work,
and abundance of available land, for with these two
essentials it can get good strong white men by
millions. It wants industries that will supply
it with every essential for the maintenance
of a civilised white population, even if its
communications with the outer world are cut off.
It wants many more taxpayers, so that it may
have revenue wherewith to provide the means of
defence. It requires to build at least two trans-
continental railways—in fact, it wants far more
than two—so that its defenders can reach every
part of its coast if necessary, and it wants settlers
and industries in order to make these railways
pay, as well as to pay for these railways. It
is in urgent need of sufficient courage and
common sense to make its people set to work
to arm and train themselves, and to make them
build a navy instead of singing “Sons of the
Sea” and “Boys of the Bullpup Breed,” and
celebrating Trafalgar centenaries and the like.
It wants to sell some of its football and make rifles
with the money. It is up to it to swap its cricket
for cartridges. It is bitterly in want of some sen-
timent that will enable it to realise that we can’t
always be the remotest outpost of the white race
without being prepared to maintain that position
by force of arms ; that we can’t always challenge
greedy Asia without a gun to back up the chal-
lenge. And while we want all these things we
have—what?
• * * •
First, we have the Protectionist party. It is a
good party, but too diluted. It recognises fully
that we need population; that we need industries
to employ population, and that it is only by creat-
ing these industries that we can get population ;
that we should be able to make everything required
for our own defence ; and, so far, its patriotism is
beyond question. But only a section of it is solid
on the fact that we must break up the great
estates to find room for hundreds of thousands of
small settlers —the men who carry the gun most
sturdily in time of trouble. The party has no
whole-hearted scheme of defence, apart from the
wretched Playford and his projected gun-barrel
factory. It isn’t solid on the construction of a
really serviceable Australian navy. Its Affable
leader wastes time arguing over small financial
points, instead of acquiring the Northern Terri-
tory promptly on the best terms he can make, and
hurrying on with those two railways which may
be urgently wanted for defence purposes any day.
The Protectionist party is a patriotic and truly
Australian party, but it isn’t the whole hog Aus-
tralian party that it should be.
• • * •
The Labor party comes next. It is solid enough
on the breaking up of the great estates, though its
proposed method—a graduated land-tax ranging
from to 4d. in the £—looks rather inadequate
for the purpose. Still, it would certainly
do a great deal towards removing one of the
worst hindrances to population and progress. As
for the promotion of Australian industry the
Labor party officially sinks the fiscal issue,
but it proposes to take a referendum on the tariff
question at next election three years hence— three
years hence ! —as if time were all our own, and Asia.
might not be at our gates inside three years, and
as if three years hence were not about the time
when Germany reckons it may be able to make a
bid for the supremacy of the ocean, and upset all
the old ideas about the absolute security of
British guardianship. The Labor party (as a
party—some of its leaders are wiser) is cold
on the subject of defence, which many of its
members describe as “ militarism ” ; it takes little
interest in immigration; it puts no enthusiasm
into the question of the two transcontinental
railways, without which half the Australian sea-
board might be occupied while the other half
hardly heard of the circumstance. It is also a
patriotic Australian party, but it doesn’t see far
enough ahead to realise that when it made White
Australia its watchword it issued one of the most
comprehensive challenges in history, and that
such a challenge needs a gun behind it as well as a
Wages Board and an Eight Hours movement.
* * * *
Last of all, Australia has the Unclean party,
the Unpatriotic party, the Anti-Australian party.
It is against land ‘settlement and the acquisition
of a sturdy country population of small settlers,
and is solid on the right of the great landlord to
keep Australia empty and consequently defence-
less in order to satisfy his brutal greed and his
sordid pride. It believes in having huge estates
and great empty areas, and in warning off agri-
cultural settlers because we have no land to give
them, and in letting the sons of such settlers as we
have drift away through inability tofind soil to camp
upon. Its policy is one of destroying Australian
industries to make room for imports, though some
of its members cadge for votes by expressing their
readiness to protect the few industries we already
possess—as if a handful of industries such as we
already possess could satisfy any progressive
people ! It is opposed to the growth of an indus-
trial population just as it is to the growth of an
agricultural population. It has no scheme for the
defence of Australia, and it includes little after-
noon-tea Kelly and persons of his kind, who scoff
at the idea of Australia making a serious effort to
guard its own territory. It talks White Aus-
tralia, and it has the cordial support of Bruce
Smith, who seems to believe no white man should
have a job if a nigger wants it. It includes
the whole Stinking Fish crowd, which for years
slandered and lied about Australia till this
country became a bye-word—a crowd which kept
its money here because it knew the cash was
quite safe, while it told amazing yarns about the
unanimous flight of capital, till the world stood
appalled at the picture of howling desolation. It
is the party that goes round with the “broken
home” under its arm, and the confiscation lie
in its mouth, and its hand full of legends
about the bursting of the marriage tie; and in
between times it raises the rent and spends part
of the surplus in buying jewellery for the lady
with the variable hair and the artificial counten-
ance. And among its apostles are G-EOB.GE Reid
the Yes-No, Judas Cook, importer M‘Millan,
Maximilian Hirsch, who has the hearty support
of the American Harvester people, .Lonsdale, the
alleged Single-taxer, Gibb, who warns the people
of the Hume against immigration, and others of
their kind. No Australian can go wrong next
week by voting against any member of this push.
* • • *
But even at the best there is reason to fear that
Australia—Australia in the largest, widest, most
national and most patriotic sense of the term —■
is a candidate whose deposit will be lost on the
12th.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Karl Marx Joke and Other Anti-Sosli
Jokes.
On December 12 there will be held in Australia
about the most curious election on record. It
turns, so far as the Tory party can make it do so,
on the sudden discovery of the Socialistic bogey.
Until about twelve months ago, when it became
evident that Freetrade was really and truly a dead
horse, there was no Socialistic bogey. It arose
in a night, so to speak. This time last year hardly
one of the fussy society women, who now rush
around with their mouths full of garbled extracts
from the allegedly dreadful writings of Karl
Manx (and occasionally Gronlunii), had heard of
Karl Marx (or Gronlund), and even now they
hardly know the latter from Greenland. Marx
was born nearly 80 years ago, and he died 23
years ago, and was buried without doing Austra-
lia any harm, and, until the Reid party found out
that Freetrade was no more use as a battle-cry, not
a soul in the Fat camp took the slightest interest
in Marx, or had the least idea that his bones were
raging dangerously throughout the land, or that
his skull was combustible. And these same fussy
society persons had lived for 15 years right along-
side a peaceful and respectable Labor party, and
never once took the trouble to imagine that that
party proposed to wreck the home and the hearth
and the marriage tie; in fact, from 1894 to 1899
they allied themselves politically with the alleged
wreckers, and spoke of them, so long as they kept
Reid in office, as a very quiet, peaceful and re-
spectable set of men. When Reid all at once in-
formed his followers and his press barrackers that
they were to become terrified about the “home,”
and to realise that confiscation and anarchy were
at hand, and that Karl Marx was calculated to
upend society, the party staggered at first and
said “Whaffor?” It took it a month or so to
realise the new attitude that was expected of it,
and it went out with a wild expression and an
uncertain pair of legs to learn its part. It found
that it had suddenly to “view with alarm” a
man of whom it had never heard, and who
died before some of it was born, and to be scared
to death over a Labor policy that had been living
next door to it for 15 years without scaring it
worth a cent. At first it made bad mistakes and
viewed the wrong man with alarm, and a section
of it makes bad mistakes still. Some of its advo-
cates, especially its lady advocates, got names
mixed up, and declared wildly that from their
childhood upwards they had been horrified at the
Socialistic doctrines of a German who never did
anything worse than write heavily about fortifi-
cation, or a Frenchman whose strong point was
agricultural chemistry, or an Italian painter, or
Chilian President, or a horse that won the Vic.
Derby in 1872. Even now the most energetic
Anti-Sosh lady-canvasser has occasionally to take
a paper out of the bosom of her dress and surrep-
titiously refer to it to find out what person she is
alarmed at, and what doctrine she is terrified
about. Then the original Anti-Sosh doctrine had
to be simplified to bring it down to the level of
its advocates. The statement that the graduated
land-tax would imply a partial confiscation
of land values was a thing that the Women’s
National League and similar bodies tried to grasp,
and couldn’t. They wanted a plain, simple,
crude oleograph of a lie, done in two colors—one
glaring red and one shrieking green. So they
went forth to tell the housewife of the oack street
that the Labor party had guaranteed o confiscate
her house. And when she replied that she hadn’t
any house, being only a tenant in difficulties with
the rent, they said wildly that the Labor party
meant to take the kitchen table and the dresser.
And when she asked what on earth the Labor
party meant to do with the kitchen table and the
dresser, the Anti-Sosh female replied excitedly
that Pontius Pilate— no, Karl Marx—
was going to burn them, or they were
going to be sold and the money given
to J. C. Watson, or Caesar Borgia, or some
dreadful person. There were, of course, incon-
gruities and incoherencies and discrepancies about
this sort of thing. It was impossible for a stout,
good-humored, beaming lady, whose husband
was known to be investing largely in real property
all over the district, to state that everything had
become so insecure that capital was flying from
the country in fear of plain, dreadful revolution,
without the statement looking as if it didn’t hang
together. But, after all, the Anti-Sosh female-
most of the party seems to be either female or
male-woman—is reasonably sincere in her own
foolish, chattering way. She almost believes
that she is terrified about the nefarious socialistic
doctrines taught by somebody whose name she
can’t remember, and whose books it is too much
trouble to read, just as Wilks almost fancies at
times that he is really in danger of being burned
at Smithfield, and that he is valiantly facing the
Inquisition in Balmain. And when the election
is over—well, a month after the election is over—
half the Anti-Sosh party will have forgotten the
difference between Karl Marx and Frederick
the Great.

Socialism, Savagery, and Sausage-Meat.
“S. J.” writes : Melb. Argus, which in Victoria
stands at the head of a wild, screaming, hysteri-
cal Tory-Freetrade-Anti-Sosh campaign, came
out, the other day, with a weird outbreak, which
is given below. The outbreak suggests that a
number of alleged facts have been flung into
somebody’s brain as hunks of flesh are flung
into a sausage-machine, to be squeezed out in a
series of paragraphs, like a string of greasy
sausages. The Argus’s half-pound of sausage
is as follows :
Socialism and Savagery.
Socialism is to-day existing in Australia, not as a costly
State experiment, but an actual ordered (or disordered)
system of life of the community. It is the form of
government in numerous societies—small, but of old
standing. They live in Central and North-west Aus-
tralia, and Professor Baldwin Spencer has written a very
interesting book regarding their habits and their institu-
tions.
Among these dusky Socialists the:re is no accursed
private ownership of land. Every man builds his mia-
mia where he will. There is no tyradmy of private enter-
prise grinding the faces of the pm'or. The bandicoot,
baked in mud on the ashes, is fn a e to aIL The sacred


sticks and emblems are the property of all the tribe.
Even the tribal dogs belong to no one in particular. No
shameless aboriginal Rockefeller has ever tried to
establish a monopoly in yams. . ,
Once these progressive nations had marriage lavs of the
ideal nature, pictured by that logical but indiscreet
Socialist, Mr. H. G. Wells. A man’s wife belonged to
him no more than she belonged to his neighbor. The
happy community floated hand in hand upon that sea of
love which the Fabian novelist paints so exquisitely.
Alas 1 they have fallen from that perfect state. But who
knows how they may not be regenerated when the
Socialist redeemers go forth to preach to them ?
Why not leap back to their condition of happiness im-
mediately? Why drift gradually to the blissful goal?
These advanced nations are naked and hungry, it is true ;
but among* them all men are Equal. It is Socialistic to
be hungry, provided that everyone else is hungry too.
As for clothes, they are only the outward and visible signs
of inequality. Clothes connote a wardrobe ; a wardrobe,
a house ; a house, a plot of private ground. It was from
clothes that the world’s present miseries began.
Let us be Socialists with Jacky.
This effort resembles the sausage in its methods
of production, and also in its murky, rancid
misrepresentation ; for no man has yet invented a
sausage which dares to state truthfully what it
contains. For instance
“Socialism exists among the aborigines of Australia.”
This is a fragment of slink veal, masquerading fraudu-
lently as honest pork. There is only one trace of
socialistic law and order in a native tribe, in that it will
go jointly to battle against another—the very rudest and
earliest Socialism. The abo. has no socialist police. If
Jacky steals a club from another Jacky, each of them can
belt h—ll out of the other, and it is nobody’s business to
interfere. If a gin is going to have a baby, that is
purely her own personal concern. She just goes wherever
she thinks hand>, and has it. It is her own business
whether she humps that baby on her back or leaves it.
The Argus, after declaring up till now that Socialism
means the cast-iron regulation of everything, starts to
allege that it means the disorderly letting-slide of things
in general. Pass out the slink veal !
“Once they had wives in common.” This is a piece of
flesh of dubious nature. In the marriage rules and cus-
toms of some tribes there is a suggestion that per-
haps tribal marriage once existed. But, even if it did,
it was when Jacky had even less Socialism than the infini-
tesimal quantity which he has now.
“No aboriginal Rockefeller has arisen to make a
corner in yams.” This is a lump of plain, decayed dog. I
have known a Jacky make a coiner in a piece of good
salt beef that he got from a white mail’s camp. And the
others assaulted him —as individualists, not as Socialists
—for when he surrendered, in a bruised condition, who-
ever got the biggest section of beef kept it.
There are many other fragments of dog and cat
and unborn calf in the parcel of bad meat, but
I let them alone in order to throw the Argus
sausages away. They are beginning to smell.
By the way, though, the Argus forgot to men-
tion that its savages have no Protective tariff,
no Labor caucus, no graduated land-tax, no
State-owned railways, no trades-unions, no
scheme for the nationalisation of the tobacco
industry, no Minimum Wage law, no Arbitra-
tion Boards. Poor wretches ! It is lack of
these things that has brought them down to
the Argus level.

Keidism—its Last Phase.
The electors of Australia, on Dec. 12, will, in
few instances, be able to record a satisfactory
positive vote. The candidate is rare who includes
in his platform all that is necessary to set Aus-
tralia’s laggard feet on the path of progress. But
in a vast majority of the electorates at least, a
negative vote can be given against a Reid candi-
date. The man who has voted against a REID-ite
has done something at least to make Australia
a safer and better land to live in. REip-ism has
been a Protean curse in Australian politics. At
present, its shape is Anti-Socialism. But it has had
many previous manifestations. Its first success
was when in the one campaign it at once took
advantage of the Labor discontent with the
Dibbs Government, and “knifed” the veteran
Parkes. Dibbs had held office through some
years of bitter depression and serious industrial
unrest. On the whole, his administration was
good. He made a beginning with Protection.
He put the finances on a more honest and
sound basis than before, or since. His Attorney-
General (now Mr. Justice Barton) reformed the
franchise and gave the electors one-man-
one-vote. During the bank crisis the Govern-
ment acted with sound judgment and courage.
But there were serious mistakes. Among them
was the prosecution, or rather persecution, of the
Broken Hill strike leaders. At the polls, when
the general election came round. Reid took full
advantage of those mistakes. He out-shrieked
every other demagogue in his appeals to Labor.
To him their Socialism was a far more desirable
thing than “the creature Protection” which
Dibbs represented. Poor Parkes was left out of
the race of this shameless demagoguey. He was
fairly artlul, the veteran, but Reid, who could
promise anything, tickle the ears of the lowest
groundlings, and throw flip-flaps if need be to
catch votes, beat him. The Dibbs Government
was destroyed, and Reid attained to office. Reid-
ism then meant a servile truckling to Labor, and
an enthusiastic ad vocacy of Freetrade. At the next
elections REiD-ism appeared as a still more com-
plete subservience to Labor, and as an enthusi-
astic advocacy of unimproved land values taxation
as the panacea for all political ills. Then the
Federal movement —to which Reid’s attitude had
been that of an embittered and hostile clown
(among other things, he compared the idea of
N.S.W. joining a Federation to the position of a
sober, decent man who goes to live with half-a-
dozen drunken disreputables)—came into promin-
ence. It threatened to destroy REiD-ism, which then
was Anti-Federation. ButREiD-ism never believed
in being out of office if a change of principle could
avert such a calamity, and when the efforts of
Deakin in Victoria, Barton in N.S. Wales, a,nd
Kingston in 8. Australia had brought Federation
to the rank of the question of the day, Reid sud-
denly became a Federalist. That sudden conver-
sion was promptly followed by the most dis-
reputable exhibition of REiD-ism on record. It
becoming apparent that if the Federation was
consummated, Barton, and not Reid, would be
its first Premier, Reid threw his bulk in the path;
his infamous Yes-No, coupled with his failure to
prevent the N.S.W. Parliament from its equally in-
famous breach of the conditions of the Federal En-
abling Act, destroyed thefirstFederal Constitution.
Reid was quite frank as to his motives. He
wanted to be “top-dog,” and wasn’t. When
there seemed another chance of his becoming
top dog he turned again, and REip-ism once
more took on the mask of Federalism. But
the Federal Prime Ministership eluded his grasp,
and Reid at the first Federal elections again
took the field as the foe of union, as the
leader of the party of discontent and ob-
struction. During the whole life of the first
Federal Parliament REiD-ism was represented by
but one ambition—to gain office by an alliance
with the Labor party. Reid and his followers
were prepared to vote almost anything that the
Labor party favored, if thereby the Government
could be dispossessed. But all schemes failed, and
by the time of the second Federal elections, Reid
had drifted away from his old demagoguey, and
had lost much of his old hope of gaining office by
grace of the Labor party. RsiD-ism raised there-
fore the banner of Freetrade and Sectarianism.
It appealed for votes in the cause of the destruc-
tion of Australian industries and the perpetuation
of old-world religious rancors. Again Reid failed,
and the history of the second Parliament is a
record of his intrigues to get to office, not this
time with the help of the Labor party, but by
playing on the fears of the Conservatives.
That game gave Reid at least a taste
of success. For a few days of Parliament
and many months of recess, Reid was
£-Prime Minister, to be, however, promptly
dismissed when Parliament re-assembled. Now,
REiD-ism makes its final appearance, and its
banners this time are Sectarianism and something
called Anti-Socialism, which analyses down to
abuse of the Labor party, by alliance with which
Reid first won to office and to which he truckled
so slavishly for so long as it was willing to give him
place. Freetrade has .disappeared from his pro-
gramme, because Reid recognises that Freetrade
is hopeless, and he never wastes time in believing
in anything that is hopeless. What is left is a
rallying cry to the discontented and an appeal to
the advocates of colored labor, to the friends of land
monopoly, to the preachers of bigotry, to the
enemies of Australian industries, and of Australian
liberties. REiD-ism appeals thus to the electors in
antagonism to everything that is wholesome and
national. Its destruction is about the only task
to which Australian electors can definitely set
themselves on December 12.
The New Hebrides.
Prime Minister Deakin received a deputation
from the Presbyterian Church the other day in
regard to the New Hebrides, and preached a very
poor sermon from a very good text. The text
found for him was this from the official report of
the British High Commissioner for the Pacific:—
These Presbyterian missionaries, the excellence of
whose intentions I have absolutely no reason to doubt,
have been so long established in those parts, and have so
lon«- been unchecked by the concurrent existence of any-
thing representing lay government, that they may to
some extent feel themselves the ruling power in the
islands, and they are inclined more or less to resent not
merely the authority, but even the existence of lay
government. They especially resent the gradual growth
of French influence. And w'ere it not for the hope of
help in combating this, some, at least, of them would, I
believe, endeavor to ignore British Government authority.
From that text, which fully explains why a
handful of parsons are prepared to bring the
British empire into a quarrel with a friendly
State over a few specks on the map of the Pacific,
Deakin might have discoursed eloquently. He
might have pointed out that it was quite natural
and in strict accordance with hereditary tradition
that the Presbyterian ecclesiastics should strive to
get a spiritual and temporal dominion over the
New Hebrides. That was the way of any church
anywhere, from the first beginnings of churches to
Dowie at Zion, and Presbyterianism is a dour,
rocky, grasping creed at all times. He might
have then pointed out that historical evidence did
not lead any sensible man to favor Presbyterian
or any other clerical domination of temporal affairs.
When the Presbyters of England and Scotland
had been allowed to usurp temporal power the
consequences were disastrous to the community.
(To avoid any suspicion of partiality, he might
have pointed out at the same time that Roman
Catholic, Anglican, or any other religious domi-
nation, had also invariably proved evil, and that
all sects seemed grasping and rocky when they
thought they saw power ahead.) Accordingly, he
might have respectfully refused to give any
weight at all to the representations of rampant
Presbyterianism as to the New Hebrides. The
fate of those islands, the Affable One might have
remarked, would be determined purely by tem-
poral considerations, and no religious body would
be allowed even a little finger in the
pie. But Alfred Deakin did not do that. His
text was strong, but his exordium was so weak
that it wanted to lean up against something to
avert collapse. He even promised sympathetic
consideration for the outrageous claims of his
Presbyterian deputation. It is a pity Alfred
Deakin is so complaisant. The New Hebrides
present the first “Foreign Affairs ’ problem
which the Commonwealth has had to face, and
the Commonwealth enters the field as the advo-
cate of priestly domination.

The Church and Property.
Anglican parsons become a very bitter set of sin-
shifters when they are told that their church is a
rich man’s church, and that it is the apologist for
every political iniquity which serves the purpose
of the wealthy. As a side-light on this subject,
here are some extracts from the debate on “Pro-
perty ” held at the recent Church Congress ■
Canon Stephen (Melbourne): Private property was
needed in order that a man’s true self might be realised
and expressed. It was something in which bis will could
act and his character be developed and revealed.
(APPLAUSE.) , ,
Embling (Vic. M.L.C., a lay member of the Congress) .
All men here started free, and perfectly equal. If a man
failed in Australia it was either through ill-health or
laziness. (APPLAUSE.) Take the property-owners of
Australia right through ; they tried to do their best for
the people around their. The whole trend of Victorian
politics for 50 years had been to raise the poor and see
that the rich did their duty to the State. There was no
privileged class. (APPLAUSE.)
Canon Richards (Hay, N.S.W.): Those who moved
among the working classes were frequently appalled by
the frightful selfishness of the working man. (AP-
PLAUSE.) While the rich did spend a great deal of
money on themselves, the working man spent fer too
much money in drink and gambling. (APPLAUSE.)
Canon Potter (Melbourne): If all the means of pro-
duction, distribution, and exchange were nationalised,
the people would be paid by the Government, and for
that payment they would he supposed to work. What
he wanted to know was how were they going to make
people work who didn’t want to. (APPLAUSE.)
Rev. S. S. Moncrieff (of Adelaide) : It was very easy
for people who had no wealth to tell men who had what
they ought to do. . . . (APPLAUSE.)
Please note the applause. With heads like this
what must the body of the church be like?

Wanted. Some Real Men.
“ Squidge ” writes : —
When Australia’s second Parliament closed its career,
Alfred Deakin, whose great fault is his dreadful affability,
told the House that he bore not the slightest resentment
to anybody on account of anything that had been said
or done during the session. “Too generous inter-
sected Maloney, and he was right. Deakin is too
generous—foolishly generous. He would have done
better if, instead of dispensing sugary compliments, he
had told the Oppositionists a few truths about them-
selves —told them in such a way that the country might
take heed and bethink itself before it gave such repre-
sentatives another opportunity of thwarting every
attempt at good government.
At the beginning of the session, when the Government,
in accordance with its pledges, brought down the Anti-
Trust Bill, Joe Cook and his gang of obstructionists,
spoke page after page of Hansard in condemnation of
the Ministry for introducing such a contentious measure
so early in the session. The same Cook, also J.hnson and
Kelly, kept the House up all night when the Preferential
Trade proposals were introduced, so that weary members
might listen to them denounce the Ministry for “blud-
geoning” measures through at the fag end of the
session! It was the same all the way through.
Cook and his gang have spoken four times to anybody
else’s once on every measure and every proposal. Their
policy all through has been obstruction. Nevertheless
the Deakin Government is able to go to the country with
an admirable record. Twenty-five measures have been
passed into law. Thirteen Bills—ah useful measures and
some of them very necessary ones—have been rejected or
withdrawn, or else left unfinished, because the Opposition,
not being strong enoug'h to defeat them, has talked them
into temporary oblivion. . , ,
Now a word about this Opposition. Of whom does it
consist’ Its leader is G. H. Reid, Australia’s political
bankrupt, the man who as Prime Minister came to Parlia-
menfc with a Governor-General’s speech that contained
absolutely nothing—a Prime Minister without a policy.
This great man, who has the interests of .the Common-
wealth so much at heart, has appeared in its Parliament
two or three times only since he fell out of office. Even
on those occasions he only appeared because he happened
to be passing and had an hour or two to spare. His
appearance in the House was always the signal for the
stoppage of public business while he made interminable
speeches about events that happened in the long ago
when he was Prime Minister. As to this great leader s
following His trusty lieutenant is Pumpkin Smith, who
hardlv "set foot inside Parliament House all last
session. The constant attendants among Reid’s sup-
porters were Joe Cook, Willie Kelly, and Too-
much Johnson. Three more wearisome bores or
greater political tricksters it would be hard to imagine.
Cook, dyspeptic, vindictive and nasty, is always ready to
work off any trick on a Ministry that has made itself his
mortal enemy by being in office. Therefore he lends
his support to Willie Kelly— whose presence in
the council chamber of the nation is an insult to the
nation’s intelligence. This youth, too irresponsible to
regard Parliament as anything else than a skittle-alley,
too feather-brained to enter seriously into the work of
legislation, has made the House of Representatives his
playground and the dignity of the Commonwealth his
cock-shy. Associated with him were Robinson— another
schoolboy; Wilks, who is jaundiced with Yellow
Pupism ; Conroy, a political larrikin ; Lonsdale, irre-
pressible and irresponsible; and Johnson, the bore of all
b °These make up Reid’s party. There are others on the
same side of the House who vote with him and support
his policy, but these are the genuine Reidites, the leaders
of that great party of anti-Sosh about which Reid him-
self so proudly boasts. Heaven help any party that owns
such leaders ! These are the men who scream and rant
about the caucus of the Labor party. Yet their own
political methods are those of pure autocracy. The
caucus means the rulj of the majority. Job Cook and
Pumpkin Smith stand for one-man rule. When the
Chief,” as they call him, bids them obstruct they sit up
all night and talk, and hinder the work of the country in
every possible way. Surely when these professional ob-
structors go before their constituents the people will re-
member these things and boot them into the obscurity
they deserve.
The Peregrine Pickle.
Some remarkable litigation arising from the
alleged sale of an Australian steamship to a
Russian Government agent, prior to the fall of
Port Arthur, promises to provide much sustenance
for the lawyers, both in Sydney and Melbourne.
In November, 1904, a certain John Moller cabled
from Shanghai to Captain Miles, in Singapore,
asking him whether he could purchase two fast
steamships for prompt delivery at Hong Kong.
Moller was acting for one Varawa, who repre-
sented the Russian Government, and Milks
(formerly of the Tasmanian State Ministry) was
looking to Howard Smith and Co. for the
desired vessels. Miles nominated the firm s
s.s. Peregrine as being just the thing that
Moller wanted, and eventually the sale was
agreed upon subject to certain conditions. The
negotiations, conducted by cable, were prolonged
for four weeks, at the end of which time Moller
was still whistling for the delivery of the
Peregrine, whilst Howard Smith and Co., and
Miles, the go-between, were making a similar
noise for the purchase money. At last Moller,
accompanied by his principal, Varawa, went to
Melbourne for the purpose, clearly, of arriving at
a definite understanding with the owners of the
Peregrine. If Varawa’s intention when he set
out for Australia was to put up the money and
take the boat, his enthusiasm possibly cooled on
the voyage. Russia was then contemplating
peace with Japan. When pressed by H.S.
and Co.’s solicitor to carry out the alleged
contract, Varawa denied that any binding con-
tract had been made, and straightway he and
Moller left Melbourne for Sydney, where
they booked their passages for Shanghai. Next
day the body of Varawa was seized in
Sydney under a writ of Capias, the shipping firm
having started an action, claiming £BOOO penalty
—or damages —for the non- completion of the dis-
puted contract. Por 11 days the important
Russian personage was confined to Darlinghurst
Gaol, but on paying £4OOO into court he got his
release. The Law has moved very slowly in this
Peregrine case since it swooped down so suddenly
upon Varawa in Sydney last January. Nothing
more was heard of the trouble until lately, and
then it broke out in two places. Captain Miles,
who conducted the abortive negotiations between
Howard Smith and Co. and John Moller (acting
for Varawa), sued his brother agent for 5 per
cent, commission on £26,000, the amount net which
the shipping firm was to have received for the
Peregrine. The action was tried in Melbourne by
Justice Hodges, and he made short work of it. He
decided that the cables interchanged by Moller
and Miles were merely negotiations with a view of
purchasing the vessel in their joint interest, so
that they—plaintiff and defendant—might earn
commissions. The vendors’ conditions, said Justice
Hodges, were never agreed to by Moller ; there-
fore there was no contract whatever for the sale of
the vessel. This question of commissions, as
between Moller and Miles, touches the other
legal proceedings in which Varawa and Howard
Smith are involved, for whereas Miles claimed
5 per cent, on £26,000 from Varawa’s agent,
Howard Smith and Co. claimed that Varawa
had contracted to buy the Peregrine for £28,000.
This is but a side-question, however. Nq sooner
had Justice Hodges, in Melbourne, dismissed the
claim of Miles v. Moller than the claim of
Howard Smith v. Varawa came up for decision
by Justice Pring and a jury in Sydney. In this
case the learned Judge read all the cables
which Justice Hodges had read, and came to an
exactly opposite conclusion on them. Justice
Pring held that there was a binding contract for
the purchase of the Peregrine. The damages
were assessed at £IO,OOO, the learned Judge re-
marking that the case would doubtless be taken
to higher courts. His complacent manner of
using the term in the plural—courts—seemed very
characteristic of the horrible legal belief that law
is made for lawyers, and litigants are their lawful
prey. The N.S.W. Pull Court, needless to say,
has granted a new trial in the case of Howard
Smith and Co. v. Varawa. The latter has
the Russian Government behind him, and
whichever way the Pull Court decides, there
is pretty certain to be an appeal to the
Federal High Court. Meanwhile an action,
Varawa v. Howard Smith and Co., is pending
in the Victorian Court. Varawa claims £20,000
damages for alleged false imprisonment. As
to whether there really was a business contract
for the non-fulfilment of which the indignant
Varawa has suffered so much worry, it remains
for other Judges to d ecide whether J ustice Hodges
rightly decided and Justice Pring wrongly decided
or vice versa. Nothing is certain except that the
Russian gentleman was confined in Darlinghurst
Gaol for 11 days, as the result of his having been
called upon to defend an action for breakage of a
contract that couldn’t be broken unless it was
made. And the Law on the subject of the making
is at present in a Yes-No state.
Local Government—in Hobbles.
N.S. Wales Legislative Council, which repre-
sents nobody, which was elected by nobody—
which, in fact, consists largely of men who were
refused election by the people —has just decided
that local self-Government shall not really exist
in the State. The Local Government Extension
Bill, as it left the Assembly, provided that muni-
cipalities might do a great many things if they
wanted to. It did not say that they should do
them; it simply gave them large powers of
governing themselves. The Leg. Council, which
represents nobody, now denies them these powers
of self-government. It will not permit them to
tax themselves to carry out local improvements
beyond a miserably insufficient amount. By
one sweeping amendment it restricts the total
rates to 2d. in the £ on the unimproved
capital value, and l|d. in the £ on the improved
value. If this provision goes through, it will
mean disaster to many municipalities. Take
Redfern, for example, with rates now amounting
to £11,568 per annum (the figures are for last year,
as given in the N.S.W. Statistical Register).
The foolish Leg. Council's maximum two-penny
rate on the unimproved capital value would bring
in only £6731 —barely more than one-half of the
present rates. The Council has no right to inter-
fere with the self-taxing powers of the people;
but, at the least, if it does interfere, it ought to
see to it that it fixes a maximum which will leave
the municipalities moderately solvent, and if it
fixed two different kinds of maximum they
shouldn’t be so wildly discrepant as to amount to
a burlesque. So absurd is the Council’s provision,
that, while the ljd. maximum on the improved

From Place and Time and Number
Towards that spectral strand

There, every shapeless Notion
On leaden wings flits by,
With atoms in commotion
So contradictory
That land is mostly ocean,
And salt lakes mainly sky.

(Nirvana’s dim recess)
Are built from Reid’s abscissions
Of rather more or less ;
Antediluvian visions
Of baldhead Nothingness.

value would bring in, for all the suburbs of Sydney,
a total of £347,157, the 2d. maximum on the unim-
proved value would bring in less than half that
amount —to be exact, £163,196, which is only
about two-thirds of the present total rates.
Apparently the real object is to kill the system
of Uxing land on its unimproved value—to do
this in the interests of the fat incubus who holds
land out of use for the sake of the rise in price
which the extra demand, caused by the squeezing-
out of the people, gives it. Having, then, inter-
fered with “the liberty of the subject” in this
general way, the Council, which professes tolove the
liberty of the subject above all things, cuts down
the freedom in a few dozens special ways, refusing
the people the right to spend their own money in
providing and maintaining ferries, light railways,
pawnshops, public laundries, and other things and
services that in other countries —England in-
cluded—municipalities have for many years under-
taken. The Carruthers Government hasn’t
made any emphatic remarks about any of these,
either; at present it looks as though it will put
up with the butchery, and subsequently strike
attitudes, and go to the country as the Ministry
that established local government. On the other
hand, it still has the chance to partly pull itself
out of the bog into which it has drifted by firing
back the maimed object at the Council, and show-
ing that irresponsible crowd that the powers of
the people shall not be cut away from them by a
dozen political culls and has-beens, fearful of some
Fat absentee friend of theirs having to pay an
extra ha’penny in municipal rates.

The Wrong Kind of Immigrant.
A Maorilander sends this :
Maoriland, desirous of living up to its threat to com-
plete the North Island Main Trunk Railway by 1908, told
its High Commissioner Reeves, a while ago, to send out
some navvies. Reeves revelled in the job of selecting
and exporting the British brawn. Soon there arrived
watchmakers, bursting with competence to push 4e wt. bar-
rowloads over stiff clay; costermongers from the wild bush-
lands of Whitechapel, desirous of conquering the primeval
supplejack; drapers’ assistants from Battersea, who
didn’t bring their own picks, but who were frothing to
shift 10yd. of rock a day; and factory-hands from the
Black Country, obviously adapted to slinging a long-
handled shovel. When a draper-navvy threw himself
into a waterhole and forgot to answer the roll-call, and
a cotton-spinner shot himself in a boarding-house, and
when various other samples of Reeves’ Brawn drifted
about the country complaining of a vacant feeling under
the waistcoat, Premier Ward told Reeves not to
be so dashed energetic. But Maoriland still flooded the
railway platforms of Hingland with pictures of Hinemoa
in a feather-kilt; and literature alleging that the Garden
of Eden was but a gumfleld compared with “God’s Own
Country " was to be found in every pub. People who
could read saw dollars in hustling those who couldn’t
across the water. The shipping companies fell on the
necks of the touts who rounded up the grocers’ clerks of
Slumpton, and Stoke-Pogis, and the touts began to do
an amazing business by quoting extracts from the Maori-
land -Year Book, the Settlers’ Guide and the Tourists
Department’s picturesque works. So Maoriland finds
that, although Reeves has been suppressed, the man from
behind the cheese counter is still arriving, wearing riding
pants and a wide hat, and intimating bis desire to manage
a station ; the shipping-clerk from Tilbury Docks has
announced his intention of bossing the Bank of New
Zealand ; and the father of a family, with a capital of
tuppence, has definitely left the flower-pot moulding
business to take up the land which is “absolutely
given away.” When the Battersea character finds
the M.L. farmer still prefers to employ the person
who has been milking cows from the time he was weaned,
he gets angry and says it’s a blasted country, and doesn’t
compare with Battersea, and rushes off to the Charitable
Aid Boards, and lives on them as long as they will stand
him. He thinks that as he has been assisted into God’s
Own Country, the Creator should keep on feeding him.
Maoriland, still with the idea that it is a good deal larger
than China or Hindustan, nevertheless finds that the
constant arrival of fresh hundreds of people, who have to
make a new start in life, is a hampering circumstance.
The Trades Councils have written to the papers of the
Cold Country, saying that the weather is bleak in M.L.,
that nobody can live on 3d. a day, and that if a job of
shovelling mud is advertised there are more local appli-
cants for the job than there are shovels in the locker. Of
course, Maoriland’s chief need is population, but popula-
tion that has to be fed out of the charitable funds when
it gets to its earthly paradise, and which throws itself
into a water-hole after a brief trial of hard work, is
not to be encouraged. To make immigration fair to
the immigrants and to the country, M.L. has got to
understand that its export of raw materials is not the
only thing a country need yell about. It has got to see
the feebleness of attracting men with 3s. 6d. to land that
costs £45 an acre, and it’s got to find out that a man who
has driven a donkey-cart in the “Heast Hend”is not
necessarily going to depose the bushman who has been
fighting trees all his life. Most of all, M.L. has got to
squash the shipping companies’ touts, who are mostly re-
sponsible for the influx of the wrong sort of settler, and
incidentally, to push its marvellous Land Bill through to
make the persons who hold upwards of £50,000 worth of
land disgorge for the benefit of the people who are aching
to get enough earth to grow produce that will warrant
the influx of navvies from “ ’Yde Pawk ” and bushmen
from the Old Kent Road.

One of the early episodes of the Melbourne build-
ing trades strike was the appeal made by the
Board of the Alfred Hospital to the strike com-
mittee urging that work should not be suspended
at that institution. Whereupon the strike com-
mittee courteously resolved :
That the secretary be instructed to write the secretary
of Alfred Hospital committee, informing him that this
committee is willing to appoint a small sub-committee to
confer with the hospital committee and contractor, with
a view to overcoming the difficulties in connection with
construction of the operating-ward.
And the Board of the hospital discourteously
replied :
That the secretary be instructed to write, informing
the secretary of the United Trades Societies’ Strike Com-
mittee that this Board cannot interfere between the con-
tractor and his workmen, and that the appeal they
instructed the architect to make to the strike committee
was solely in the interests of humanity, and an effort
which they believed would be appreciated by the work-
ing classes to prevent delay in the construction of the
new operating room (which is almost entirely for
their benefit), the cessation of the work of which un-
necessarily impairs the efficiency of the hospital.
Observe the situation : The Board didn’t wait to
find out what offer the men proposed to make.
For all it knew to the contrary, they might be
willing, so far as the hospital was concerned, to
abandon all their claims “in the interests of
humanity.” But, rather than be seen talking to
some mere workmen, the Board threw the in-
terests of humanity overboard. It was willing to
interfere in the quarrel between “the contractor
and his workmen,” by writing to the men at a
distance, but it wouldn’t interfere by sitting in
the same room with them, and speaking to them.
There its poker-backed dignity got in the road.

Despairing cry of a Herald correspondent
Mr. D. Witenden, Stoekinbingal, writes pointing out
the effect which the incidence of the proposed Socialist
land-tax would produce. The first effect would be that
values would fall about 50 per cent. Ninety per cent, of
the lands privately owned were mortgaged for more than
half their value. Some of the purchasers had not paid
more than 10, 15, or 20 per cent, of their purchase money,
while others had had to go to the banks on account of
drought, bush fires, and rabbits. The inevitable result of
the tax would be that the greater portion of the land
would fall into the hands of the banks and other financial
institutions, which would be ruined by the sudden
depreciation in values. If the tax is imposed, he con-
tends that it will cause the greatest financial and indus-
trial calamity that Australia has ever been called upon to
witness.
Let’s see. On a property where the unimproved
value—the value of the bare ground—isn’t over
£5OOO, the tax will be nothing at all. How many
of the people that B. Witenden wails about at
Stoekinbingal own over £5OOO worth of land ? The
man with £5OOO worth of land is probably worth
at least £lO,OOO, when his house, furniture, fences,
stock, implements, crops, &c., are counted in. if
his £5OOO worth of land is mortgaged for more
than half its value (say for £3000), that leaves him
a poor, haggard wretch, worth £7OOO clear. And
the land-tax won’t touch him or anybody poorer
than him. Why is B. Witenden making all this
row at Stoekinbingal ?
Jaerah Jack Forrest, in the course of a recent
speech at Perth, said: “I am in favor of the
establishment and development of industries and
manufactures.” Now, here are a couple of Wes-
tralian samples of the way he “established and
developed industries.” In the late nineties the
mossy-backs of Busselton—in John’s then elec-
torate —awoke sufficiently to clamor for a butter
factory. Forrest spent thousands of pounds of
public money on brick buildings, engines, cream
separators, freezing plant, churns, butter-workers,
&c.—the most complete plant of its kind in Aus-
tralia. The mossy-backs attended in great force at
the champagne lunch—given by the Government,
of course—at the opening, and then went back to
sleep. For eight years the total output of butter
was about 6cwt. Then the whole outfi t was handed
over, regardless of cost, to a private firm, and
after ten years of Bigjohn’s intelligent attempt to
“establish and develop an industry,” the follow-
ing appears in the West Australian (12/11/’06):
A Record Consignment of Butter.—What is stated to
be the largest consignment of butter manufactured in
the State will be brought to Perth to-day. The weight
of the butter, which was produced at Busselton by Messrs.
Macfarlane and Co. Ltd., and is being consigned to
Messrs. Silbert and Sharp, is lOcwt.
Fancy half-a-ton of butter causing all that fuss !
Another specimen of Bigjohn’s establishment
and development was the Ravensthorpesmelter—
a Government concern that was started to treat
the ores of a number of small mine-owners who
were beneath the notice of the capitalist. The
ores were treated at a trifle above cost, yet the
smelter was paying wages, maintenance, and
sinking fund. Then Kauffman came along and
saw a good thing in it. He made the Govern-
ment an offer to buy this profitable undertaking
at less than half its cost, and the offer was
accepted. Bigjohn has no luck at the develop-
ment and establishment of industries.

The S.M. Herald, in its Chinese madness, threw
facts and truth to the winds over the wreck of the
Australian, and rode wildly on its turtle over the
heaving sea of fiction :
When it is remembered that these
Chinese had only a few days before been
rescued from a dangerous wreck, w'hich
might have been obviated had the
Federal authorities been prompt in dis-
charging one of their rudimentary obli-
gations to see after the proper lighting
of the coast, this action can only be re-
garded as arbitrary and cruel.
Now, in the first place, even the
paper that most furiously opposes
land settlement can hardly suppose
that, while Australia has only
4,000,000 people, it can properly
light 8000 miles of coast. The Aus-
tralian Government wouldn’t have
got through one-twentieth of the
job before the Herald would be
delirious about “Federal extrava-
gance.” And, in the second place,
coastal lighting isn’t a Federal busi-
ness as yet. It is still one of the
State Rights, and if the Herald
hadn’t been so anxious to slander
the Commonwealth at any cost, it
might have remembered this fact.
N. S. Gkeen, Australasian manager of Dun’s
Mercantile Agency, is back from the United
States with some remarks that have a bearing on
the craze for importing a boss for the N.S.W.
railways :
Speaking of the railways in the western States, Mr.
Green said they compared very unfavorably with our Own
system. The cars were luxurious and comfortable, but
the tracks were nearly all in a very bad state, while in
the most cases traffic was -conducted on a single line.
Wrecks were frequent, and he happened to be in two,
but escaped injury, although on one occasion he had to
spend the night in the woods.
He “happened to be in two” ; also he spent a
night in the woods—small incidents, it seems,
that might occur any time to ’any man in the
country that the S.M. Herald wants to get a
railway manager from. When that manager
arrives—if he does arrive—and starts a competi-
tion with Tait of Victoria, it looks as though
there may be a good deal of excitement both sides
of the Murray. It also looks as though there
may be a good many funerals.

“ J.C.H.,” from the Transvaal, on the S’Aicanfr
elections: —
John Bull has decided to give the Transvaal Respon-
sible Government this month, and this will enable the
election to take place in February or March next. Then
the colony will pass back into the hands of its rightful
owners, and John Bull, Cohen and co. will wake up to
the fact that the Boer leaders have topped the poll on the
votes of John’s kith and kin. The “Progressive” and
“ Responsible ” leaders are calculating on a pretty solid
vote from the working man, but they have got the same
chance of getting the working man’s vote as they have of
being struck by lightning. Under the Dutch Govern-
ment, Johannesburg (now Jewburg) was the best city on
earth for the skilled mechanic, but since Cohen and co. and
their paid agitators worked up one of the most unholy
wars the world has ever known for the sole purpose of
getting rid of the white working man to make room for
the Chow, the city is on the ragged edge of insolvency.
Under British rule, the gates have been thrown open to
the off-scourings of Europe, until the city swarms with
the scum of the earth, and life and property are not safe
in any quarter of the city. But the votes of the working-
men and the more sensible of the business community
will enable the new Dutch Government to rid Johan-
nesburg of the Chow and the scum, and bring it back to
its old security and prosperity.
Last Sunday’s strike meeting, in Fitz-
gerald’s Circus building, makes it very evident
that Wren, of the illegal tote—the man who
lives and bloats financially on the misguided
shillings of the poor—is setting himself to bag the
Melbourne Trades Hall bodily. Apparently he
is not satisfied with the capture of the State Labor
party. Strike-leader Hannah read, with exces-
sive enthusiasm, a letter dated from a mansion
in Studley Park. Letter was from Wren. He
pointed out how Stoessel surrendered at Port
Arthur and was now disgraced, then drew a most
feeling analogy, and ended up by laying at the
strikers’ feet his great business capacity to promote
any entertainment in their aid. With Hannah’s
sympathetic reading and the extra flourish which
heralded the announcement of a £2OO enclosure,
the meeting was captured on the spot, and
great was the cheering for thetote vampire.

A Bulletin man goes to‘“Wonderland ” :
On Saturday night last Wonderland City at Bondi
burst upon Sydney’s startled gaze with a roar and a bang.
It was in a more or less incomplete state, but as Mr.
Anderson wished to be present at the opening of his
greatest undertaking, and Saturday was the latest he
could wait, the flower of his enterprise blossomed out
somewhat prematurely. Wonderland City takes in the
site of the old Aquarium, and includes the little bay and the
deep ravine round which the old-time switchback railway
used to run. Why it is called a city is not very obvious ;
Wonderland Gardens would be more appropriate, for the
great charm of the place is the wilderness of winding
paths, the terraced sides of the ravine, and the stretch of
delightful sandy beach where the everlasting waves
put the side shows to shame. Seven thousand
electric candles are dotted over the 22 acres, and
a number of arc lamps blaze with an amethyst-tinted
light. Old-time tram dummies have been transmuted into
garden houses, inviting seats nestle amid the native
shrubs, and in the farthest recesses of the grounds there
is a delightful luminous darkness that will cause the
marriage rate to go up by leaps and bounds. And that
is the chief charm of the place. The side-shows are
numerous and entertaining, but they have not the mag-
netism of that wilderness of winding paths among scrub,
flower-beds and ponds, in which cool fountains spray and
murmur. For the man who goes out to have a
riotous time, there is a theatre, in which a
variety show will rage perpetually, and there
is an open-air skating rink where he can waltz
round with his girl in his arms under the stars and in the
face of an admiring crowd. There is the puppet show,
where a miniature George Reid cavorts, a switchback
railway, a topsy-turveydom, and, last and greatest of all,
Katzenjammer Castle. And when man has raged through
all these, he can roll down the terraces, down, down to
the yellow sand of the beach, hire a bathing-costume,
and cool off in the surf.
It seems that Manager Anderson had calculated on
having about 5000 people present at his opening, and the
alert Kneeshaw of the Tram way Department made arrange-
ments for carrying 8000 or 9000 if the occasion demanded
it. But Sydney fell upon Wonderland, and the
trams were suddenly called upon, at a few minutes’
notice, to take out over 20,000. They did it remarkably
well. But the Wonderland people were flabbergasted at
the rush, the supply of tickets g’ave out, and the seething
A VEILED SPECTRE OF THE
ELECTIONS.
mass tore down the windows of the ticket office. Once
inside the huge crowd hurled itself upon the refresh-
ment departments and cleaned up everything eat-
able and drinkable, and yelled loudly for ice in
any shape or form. The waitresses were helpless,
and in the empty larder and dried up cellar the atten-
dants became gibbering idiots. Some of the papers made
caustic references to the bad management, but they were
unjust. The enormous crowd was quite unexpected.
The only suggestion The Bulletin has to make is that
admission be by turnstilea, where either cash or
tokens would be taken ; or, better still, that the trams
issue through tickets like those to the racecourse. That
would save struggling at the gates when unexpected
crowds happen along.
I could only sample one of the side-shows: Katzen-
jammer Castle. Outside the mysterious building people
were waiting by hundreds, listening to the roar of
machinery and the shrieks and howls of the victims. The
way in led up a narrow winding passage, and just as I
got nicely into it out went the light, and I tripped
over a sudden upheaval in the floor, and fell on a
mass of woman in front, whilst several cwt. of lady
fell on me from the back. As the light blazed out
again the procession arose and rushed on. Again dark-
ness fell suddenly. The floor also seemed to fall, and the
maiden in front turned round and hurled her arms round
my neck and hung upon me. The matron behind also
took a good, firm grip of me. When the light came again,
they went on their own once more, and the procession
got over some inequalities without any San Francisco hap-
penings. Then, in blackest darkness, an awful wind smote
down from overhead. Machinery waspounding at the floor,
and in the midst of a pandemonium lovely unmarried
females once more embraced me and demanded to be
taken out. Also, a girl behind got on my shoulders
and screamed to be carried away. Then I struggled
breathlessly on to a floor that oscillated like a fiend.
Later I found myself outside, carrying a young woman
and a girl, but how I got there I will never know. And
they charge only sixpence for all that catching and
jamming. It is worth Ss. 9d.

If farce is to be highly successful it must
have a leading comedian of exceptional ability
and at least one actress of bright, conspicuous
attractiveness—one whom the gods will love, and
whose photograph they will treasure. For farce
cannot depend On itself, having no self worth
mentioning to depend on, but must rely on its
acting. Essentially it is silly; the game is to
make the silliness “go” with the arts of the
comedian and the smiles of pretty women. It can
hardly be said that the comedy co. now battling
at Sydney Palace has all the qualities to
make a success of such a piece as “Turned
Up.” Inevitably it suggests comparisons with
the old Brough and Boucicault production.
But, withal, the domestic troubles in the house-
hold of mariner Medway are shown in an amusing
fashion, and win the tribute of much laughter.
“Wig and Gown,” a comedietta which precedes
the'main piece, is very, very thin, turning on the
old idea of a girl’s name being confused with a
yacht’s, and Polly’s “stays ” and the man’s inten-
tion to “run heron a month’s trial” and “to have
her scraped ” and so on appeal nowadays rather
as sacred memories than as matters of fun.
Marryat about used up this jest when he wrote
“ Newton Forster,” and that was 74 long years
ago.

The cast in Meynell, Gunn and Varna’s
co. is fairly even throughout—that is to say, it is
evenly good, not evenly bad ; but the lack of one
or two people who will stand up like towers of
mirth above the great plain of moderate and un-
blemished capacity still remains. Miss Florence
Leigh (in a good character sketch of an old
housekeeper), Miss Helen Russell, and Miss
Violet Dene (who has rather a tendency to over-
act) deserve the kindly word. H. Halley as
Captain Medway, and Harry Hill as his son,
show best among the men, though James Lindsay s
broadly farcical Carraway Bones is always amusing.
“ Turned Up” ends with this week, and then the
co. moves on, to turn up afresh in other cities.

At Her Majesty’s, Sydney, they are
getting ready to change the atmosphere, which
for a couple of months has been charged with Red
Indian, cow, sudden death, and the fluent Ameri-
can humor of Big Bill. On Saturday Tittell
Brune—now enough of an Australian institution
to do without the Miss will make her
appearance in “La Tosca” for the first
time in Sydney. Hitherto the hard-working
young American actress has been much more of a
success in the light, simple “Sunday” type of
piece than in the heavier, tragic sort; but she has
changed her methods, they say—gets to her work
before the “wild-rabbi” is abroad in the land,
and spells in the afternoons —and the change is
said to have altered her view of things. But
Saturday will tell; and Miss Brune can be sure
of a warm welcome, anyhow.

“The Midnight Wedding” will probably
hold the stage at Sydney Criterion during the
Christmas season. It is a stirring yarn, and its
uniforms and glitter, and the royal palace of
the Straddlebugs, and the rest of the pomp
have taken the taste of the public. The pres-
ence of Harcourt Beatty in the cast gives
the piece a certain distinction. Beatty is accus-
tomed to the better sort of melodrama —the sort
which Williamson or Musgrove stages without
calling it melodrama —and he brings with him its
atmosphere, which is a very different thing from
that of “ Wilful Murder,” or “ The Face at the
Window.” That is to say, it is the palatial rather
than the backyard atmosphere, and in its gloomier
aspects it breathes of the mediaeval dungeon
rather than of the midnight baked ’tater stall.

“The Lights o’ London” will be blown
out at Sydney Royal after Friday, and on
Saturday “The Cotton King” will be staged for
a fortnight’s run. If The Bulletin remembers
rightly, there is a heavy shower of real rain in
“The Cotton King,” and this inclemency of the
weather drives Baker, who has been airing his
noble principles on the lawn, to take up a strictly
honorable attitude under the verandah till the
clouds roll by. But perhaps that episode was in
some other play. Baker lias been a person of the
highest character on so many lawns that it is
difficult to avoid getting him mixed.

With a magnificent Crash Bang —the

Madame Amy Sherwin and her clever duet

The Tivoli bill is, these days and nights,
chock-full of 15-carat turns. There are no bril-
liants to speak of, but it is all good, honest value,
and mostly the old familiar gold—Seymour and
Dupre, Cassie Walmer, the Alaskas, Dawson, and
others that are, like the goods in the auctioneer’s
advertisement and the sandflies by the seaside,
too many to mention.

“What Would a Gentleman Do?” the
new Brough-Flemming production at Melbourne
Princess ? s, must be condemned on its first-night
form as an inferior and disappointing play. Things
might have presented a more convincing and
interesting aspect if it had not been that, owing
to Flemming’s illness, the part of hero was thrust
unexpectedly upon a substitute. Flemming, for
instance, might have depicted the Man from Aus-
tralia as a strong and dignified personality in
spite of his gaueherie and naive faith in a
manual of polite etiquette. As it was, Gregan
M‘Mahon, as the result of unpreparedness, simply
grafted bad grammar and awkward manners on to
the facial inanity and amiable tomfoolishness of
his English-Johnnie part in “Dr. Wake’s
Patient.” He was shoved into the new character
so suddenly that he hadn’t time to take the pre-
vious Johnnie off his countenance. To show,
however, that the weakness of the production
rests with the play more than the players, one
need go no further than the plot. Dickie Hook,
the Man from Australia, lives in England with a
blue-blooded but hard-up colonel and the latter’s
charming daughter Madge (Beatrice Day). Un-
known to the latter, the ungrammatical^Austra-
lian pays Pa for his board and lodging and
for introductions to the Very Best People.
Dickie falls in love with Madge, and is
accepted by her out of gratitude, the
Beastly Colonial having given her brother Ronald
£lOOO to pay his gambling debts. Poor Dickie,
whose favorite book is a manual entitled, “ What
Would a Gentleman Do? ” is highly flattered that
a lady of the land has endorsed his new gentility
by accepting his proposal. Unfortunately, he
overhears Madge confiding to her brother that she
cares only for Sir Kit Wynne (Carter Pickford),
•now on his way home from Melbourne with
£15,000 per year. From this on the story becomes
mawkish, not to say drivelsome. Dickie, be-
sotted with chivalrous generosity, enters upon a
course of self-depreciation, and tells Madge that
he had only wooed her from a snobbish desire to
own a blue-blooded colonel as a father-in-law,
and takes the blame of Sir Kit’s , sin in
breaking the heart of a Melbourne girl, the
daughter of a “simple schoolmaster.” This is
such tremendous lying that it seems a pity
he didn’t look up his valued manual before rush-
ing to extremes ; if he had searched in the index
under the letter L he might have got some valu-
able advice. Later, Madge learns that her lover
is the culprit, but Dickie, determined to carry the
superfluous cross of martyrdom to the bitter end,
cables to Melbourne and exonerates Kit by the
tidings that the supposed victim, less “simple”
than her father, “had never really cared.” One

can’t feel very sorry for Dickie, who is hardly up
to hero standard. Two minutes after he has
parted from Madge, Mrs. Brough, in the part of
an aristocratic aunt, contrives that he shall hear
Dolly Banter (Miss Temple) confess her hopeless
love for him. It seems a plebeian trick for a
patrician aunt to play, believing, as she does, that
Dickie’s heart is not yet off with its old love,
but the end justifies the means, and the Man from
Australia, steppingfrom hishiding-place, promptly
wins Dollie Banter. The humor of the play is
entrusted to Mrs. Brough and Miss Temple and to
J. F. Forde in the part of an Irish servant. All
three work hard and keep things moving, which
is not an easy matter in a play where all the
women but one are lovesick, and every man has
lost either his money, his best girl, or his self-
respect.

At Her Majesty’s (Melb.) “The Spring
Chicken ” is still on the roost, but retires after
to-morrow (Friday) night to allow the elaborate
perches and plumage to be packed for its Maori-
land flight. The vacant coop will be filled by
“The Girl from Kay’s” for six nights only,
Saturday (Dee. 15) being named as the date of
the comic opera’s farewell to Melbourne. The
“ Chicken’s ” last days have not gained in bril-
liance by the substitution of Arthur Crane for the
indisposed Reg. Roberts. The new man’s singing
is creditable, but his Babori is rather the stereo-
typed wife-deceiving husband of the comic stage
than the gay Parisian martyr to vernal flirtatious-
ness presented by Roberts. Another fault found
with the “ Chicken ” by a few epicures is its lack
of spice, not counteracted by the cloying sweet-
ness of mother-in-law Clara Clifton. Charmingly
chubby and coyly arch in her appeal to audiences,
this ingratiating lady, regarded in the light of a
pickle for devilled son-in-law, is sadly deficient
in mustard, pepper and vinegar. Nevertheless,
the “ Chicken,” which has crowed to good houses
throughout its Melbourne season, must be classed
as an all-round success of good staying power.
The last new tail-feather it sprouted was a bur-
lesque of “ The Man From Mexico.”

Conductor Frederic Beard, late of Bir-
mingham, had only a moderate attendance at his
Wagner-Tschaikowsky orchestral concert, at Mel-
bourne Town Hall on Saturday. The new leader
was hampered by the absence of his second bas-
soon, which left loud wind-passages brusque and
unsupported. In the “Tannhauser” overture
the trombone, too, seemed to blare forth the
accentuated theme with too raucous an emphasis,
thus sacrificing thunderous majesty to brazen
clamor. Tschaikowsky’s “Symphony Pathetique”
went with a good deal of fire and rush, and the
concert as a whole supplied testimony that worse
things might happen than the establishing in
Melbourne of another conductor, young, eager,
enterprising and experienced.

The Bulletin goes to press in an un-
usually sorrowful frame of mind, its report of
“The Face at the Window” having somehow
failed to arrive from Melbourne. It had
hoped to have supplied a vivid account of the
Shriek which peals out maniac-fashion just before
the crime is perpetrated and the victim is left
what the evening paper calls “bathed in gore,”
with three “astonishers ” after “gore.” It
expected also to give some interesting facts
about the awful Countenance from which pours the
Shriek that is behind the window pane, and shortly
before the Corpse, and a little previous to the
Funeral. There was going to be a picture of the
Face at the right-hand top corner of this page,
and the cry, which was the harbinger of death, was
to pour diagonally across the page, and hang out
like a streamer or a tassel at the left-hand bottom
corner. All these things are regretfully post-
poned, to the great detriment of this issue.

At Melbourne Opera House the show has
brightened considerably during the month, and it
is not for want of good models that Premier Bent,
who often spends Saturday afternoon in Rickards’
dress circle, continues to be tragic when he means
to be comic, and violent when he intends to be
airy and feathery. The latest addition to the
song-and-dance list is Harry Bedford’s quick and
lively rendering of a philosopher in rags. The
banjo artists continue to score brilliantly, while
Selbo, whose gaily-tinselled clubs slip and slide
and gleam and dance all round him like darting
gold and silver fish, is a juggler remarkable not
only for his clever work but for the dainty way
he does it.

the usual elaborately-faked comic items. Blanche
Arral keeps on springing one more farewell con-

and “In Conclusion ” fashion of old-time

without appropriate scenery for her items, but
she pleases the feminine mind by changing during
the evening into various drawing-room costumes ;
and the conviction steadily gains ground that she
is someone Very Distinguished travelling incog.

that is, put up cash for “ the cause.” So the yells

Mr. Harry Leader, a promising playwright who left
Sydney six years ago for England and had a measure of
success, one of his plays being staged by Mrs. Langtry,
died, on board the Omrah, between Sydney and Mel-
bourne, on November 27. He was aged 32 years.

The veteran Maskelyne broke out again lately—at St.
George’s Hall, London—as an exposer of spiritualistic
fakery. A credulous parson, one Archdeacon Colley,
was so impressed by the ghosts and things he saw at a
seance that he put up an offer of £looo—he didn’t put up
the cash—for anyone who could produce the same effects
under the same “ test” conditions on a public platform.
Maskelyne, after remarking to the audience that he was
getting very tired of the spirit trade, proceeded to pre-
sent all the “phenomena” which had amazed the
reverend challenger. His assistant played the part of the
archdeacon, haunted by a lovely vision! Maskelyne pre-
tended to fall into a trance and become the medium for
producing the vision aforesaid. A vapor issued from his
entranced body, and the form of a live woman gradually
materialised from the vapor. What tfie archdeacon had
witnessed in a darkened room was here perpetrated in
the glare of a strong electric light, with hundreds of
people looking through their opera-glasses for an expla-
nation of the trick. They could find no reason why the
archdeacon shouldn’t ante up the £lOOO.
This curious advt. appeared in Hobart Mercury:

The droughty west doesn’t suit the constitution of the

met the same misfortune, and Harold Whittle, pianist, is
at present in the fever ward of Bourke hospital.
“0.K.”: Talking of Madame Amy Sherwin, and her
occasional lapses into Scotch ballad singing, it is a mis-
taken policy for any platform artist of distinction to
make a bid for the Scottish vote unless she is going the
whole haggis. If she be not verra Scawtch, with Maggie
or Jessie for her front name, and Macsomething to follow,
she might as well be Miss Smith for all the support she
can command from the tartan clans. And there isn’t
much to be gained, as a rule, by going the whole haggis
for a series of concerts. Sandy and his wife have no
money to w'aste on musical vanities, ye ken. When they
are tempted to a concert by an appeal to their national
sentiment they feel their way carefully. In the way-
hack seats at a modest bawbee they form a cautious
opinion of the singer’s merits, and if they are favorably
impressed they take pass-out cheeks, and use them in
half payment for better seats at twa bawbees.
“ Melb.” : Williamson chooses “ Mother Goose ” for his
pantomime, because it was the most successful ever
known, and because this is the centenary of its first pro-
duction at Covent Garden (London) on Boxing Night,
1806. This leads me to a new book, just to hand, “His-
tory of Oovent Garden Theatre,” by H. S. Wyndham.
Rich, the famous harlequin and manager, founder of the
English pantomime, built the first Oovent Garden theatre
in 1732. Garrick acted there, but was mostly associaied
with Drury Lane. Oovent Garden was the scene of the
first production of Goldsmith’s “ She Stoops to Conquer,”
and Sheridan’s “ Rivals.” A long series of Handel’s operas
was g’iven there, also the first London productions of his
“Messiah,” and other oratorios. In 1802 John Kembie
bought a £20,000 share in Covent Garden, wherefore he
and Mrs. Siddons transferred from Drury Lane. Thev
lost everything in 1808 through the burning of the
theatre. Drury Lane was burnt not long after. When
the new' Oovent Garden opened there were the O.P. (Old
Prices) Riots, lasting three months. Kemble caved
in. Kean flashed upon the town at Drury Lane.
Covent Garden got Macready and Miss O’Neill. We
pursue the tangled yarn with the success of
Fanny Kemble, and the unfolding of Knowles as a
dramatist, with Macready as “ Virgini us.” A brilliant
but disastrous management w»as that of Madam • Vestiis
and Charles Mathew's, with the original production of
Boucicault’s “London Assurance.” Now conies the
management of Macready, with such productions as
Bulwer’s “Lady of Lyons,” “ Richelieu,” and “Monev,”
supported by Helen Faucit. After this opera held swav,
with Grisi, Rubini, Lablache, Mario, and the other great
ones. Also, there was the incomparable ballet of
Tag’lioni, Cerito, Grahn, etc. Skirmishing down the
years we come to the second burning, of the theatre in
1856, after a bal masque, given by Wizard Anderson on
the eve of his departure for Australia. This was just
halfw'ay between the first production of “ Mother Goose”
(1806) and the present time. Great personages identified
with the theatre in later time are Patti, Melba, and
victorious Wagner, not forgetting Gustus Harris.
Ellen Terry is alleged to have intentions of opening a
shop in the West End of London for the sale of things for
baby. It wouldn’t be her first trade venture ; once she
ran a turkey farm.
Young August Siede, whose orchestral compositions—
performed under the blessing of Marshall Hall—stamp
him as a promising musician, has completed the score of
a grand opera w'hich he hopes to get produced in Mel-
bourne next year. Siede is the first Australian-born
composer of a grand opera, and his ambition deserves
encouragement.
The motor-car is nowadays a sort of guarantee of
eminence and success in the theatrical profession in
London, and no actress can be said to have really
triumphed till she has been photographed in a costly
auto, and had the picture reproduced in many papers.
The success of “La Milo” Montagu and Cruickshank
Lang has been so big that one motor-car is not large
enough to hold them, and they are pictured side by side
in two tremendous cars, while the nose of a third peeps
in. No doubt the third is for Milo’s poodle.
Late Oily Deering- took a part in the w'ell-remembered
Vic. adaptation of “The Happy Land,” a then recent
London success. The Vic. adaptation was frankly politi-
cal, and contained some loud burlesques of Graham
Berry and his Cabinet mates of 26 years ago. Deering
caricatured “Jack” Woods, the then autocrat of the
railways. It was a great success—while it lasted. The
Berry party saw to it that it didn’t last long.
“Alba”: The logic of “The Virginian” illuminates
one of the many little side-tragedies perpetrated in the
name of Cow and Horse. The Virginian, in the interest
of his boss, guides the lynching party to his friend Steve’s
camp-fire. Everybody loves Steve, but the mere fact
that he has absconded with the sacred red animal
destroys all human pity. The Virginian covers his
emotions while Steve is being sacrificed on the altar of
the god Cow'. The gaunt heifer and the large, bony
moke have set fathers chasing sons with halters and
sheriffs across the United Shakes and other places where
hoss and cow have been allowed to annex the skyline. I
took to Trampas, the head cattle thief, from the start;
his tremulous bearskin trousers and his yearnful grunt
never required explaining. But the Virginian’s method
of stalking Trampas, in the last act, was a bit of stage
cowboyism that any Broncho Bill or bar hustler would
violently repudiate. The cow-buster who went looking
behind doors and whisky barrels to see if his enemy’s
breath was shootable, would be dead meat in a pure
gunning tournament.
Is all Poverty Point “going on the land”? Here, as
the latest, is Hamilton Hill, the baritone, telling an
English interviewer: “Heave for America next month
to do the Keith Circuit for 58 weeks. My wife pays a
visit to Australia while I am away to see her native
Wodonga once more. And in a couple of years I hope to
go out and buy a farm on the banks of the Campaspe.”
“ Stargazer ” : One is compelled to admire “ The Power
and the Glory.” It is so courageous, so contemptuous in
conquering the impossible, so magnificently original in
its disregard of dramatic conventions and law’s and ordi-
nances. We have the heroine rescued from the clutches
of perfidious villainy in a frock coat, and released from
the haunted chamber by virtue in the shape of a plump
British sailor, and in the next scene she is discovered
impersonating a marble figure on a tomb in the village
church in order to start up and confound the iniquitous
frockcoat and its scrubby associate-in-crime when they rob
the poor-box, and try to carry off the blind child, who has
wandered into the sacred edifice to preach a long sermon on
human frailty, and the advantages of the simple life.
How and why the heroine came to be sleeping on that
tomb in a w’hite “ nighty” in the damp, cold atmosphere
is left entirely to the imagination of the audience. Later,
the same heroine is madly pursued round the top of a
lofty London monument by the infuriated frockcoat, and
just as the insensate garment is about to hurl her into
the depths, the blind child, since deceased, suddenly
bursts through the adjacent clouds, hung on a wire,
whereat the infamous frockcoat cowers, and the curtain
falls, leaving Patience still on her monument, and no
better off than before. But, of course, she turns up un-
harmed in the next scene. Considered as a burlesque of
popular melodrama, “The Power and the Glory” is the
finest bit of humor staged in Australia for 10 years, but,
marvellous to relate, on the night I v'as there a sober
citizen was ejeeted for laughing at the joyous comedy.
“ Micawber ” : This is one of the late Wybert Reeve’s
early experiences, as related by himself:—“l found my-
self cast for Ross, Banquo, and the First Murderer, which
necessitated my murdering myself and reporting to Mac-
beth that I had done so. I knew, in all probability, I
should murder Shakspeare without any trouble, but I
could not see my way to the other arrangement. Mac-
duff and Malcolm mixed up Ross’s lines in the first tw'o
acts, and I was all right as Banquo up to the front-scene,
when I appeared in a cloak, slouch hat and beard, as
the murderer, and undertook my own demolition. Then,
in the murder scene, I crossed as Banquo w’ith Fleance,
threw cloak and hat on, bobbed round the wing, and
entered as First Murderer ; followed myself off and com-
mitted the'sanguinary act behind the scenes. I entered
at the banquet scene, reported I had done the deed,
threw off the cloak, put some chalk on my face and a red
gash across my throat, and was Banquo’s ghost. I after-
wards came to life for the rest of the piece as Ross.”

Claud Leplastrier, a Sydney artist who has long pleased
oity and suburban audiences with lightning sketches and
illustrated songs, has been engaged by Rickards for a
season at Sydney Tivoli—as part of that manager’s
excellent policy of giving Australian talent a chance on
every possible occasion.
Touching Anderson’s purchase of Bostock’s Circus ele-
phant for his Bondi Wonderland, a Melb. paper remarked
that the price was high, considering that the ordinary
cost of educated elephants, landed in Australia, is £250
apiece. But elephants are perishable goods, and the pro-
portion of early deaths in a shipment of beasts raises the
average value a lot higher than £250. Besides, the Bostock
elephant was an exceptionally tine specimen, and the
Wirths, who were not in dire need of another monster for
their collection, thought it good enough to bid up to
£335 for this one. Elephants evidently are regarded as
fine advertisement stock by the showmen who pay so
much money for the costly privilege of feeding ’em.
Dan Barry is a splendid advertiser. When on tour
with his “Kelly Gang” in a Gippsland town, he is
alleged to have gone to a local J.P. whom he knew
intimately and propounded a scheme. “Mr. Smith,” he
said, “you are an old friend of mine. I want you to do
me a good turn. I’m playing ‘ The Kelly Gang ’in the
local hall to-night, and, as there is a big case on at the
court this morning, ivould you announce the show from
the Bench, and hang these two day bills in the court
house.” Then the J.P. rose in his wrath, and drove Daniel
Barry headlong out of his premises. But later on he re-
lented more or less, and Daniel got his ad vt. His Honorary
Washup took his seat on the Bench looking like thunder,
and words of deep import. “ I have,” he said, “ a
most serious statement to make. An actor by the name
of Barry—Daniel Barry—called at my office a few minutes
ago, and had the audacity—the incredible audacity—to
ask me to announce his play, ‘ The Kelly Gang,’ for to-
night, and to profane the halls of justice with this bill
—this lurid and glaring bill’’—here he unrolled the bill
and shook it with the hand of reprobation—“giving the
names of the persons engaged in the frivolous proceed-
ing. This person (Barry) states that in other towns the
Bench has announced—l sincerely denounce-- 1 The Kelly
Gang,’ and that the result of the Bench’s generosity has
been what this person Barry calls a 1 full house.’ I hope
no such outrage will be again perpetrated by this person
—ahem —Barry. I trust this person Barry will under-
stand that I distinctly refuse to mention his drama of
‘The Kelly Gang’ from the bench, or to have anything
to do with his bills.” There was a good house that night,
and Dan was quite satisfied. If the story isn’t true, it
ought to be. It sounds so like Dan.
“Snell”: The most amusing incident I ever witnessed
on any stage happened at Lefroy, Tasmania, long ago,
when the local reefs wers turning out a lot of gold, and
the Native Youth was paying fat dividends. Lefroy was
a good pitch for a nomadic show, and the Grand English
Dramatic Company, run by Ferguson and Gadd, two
enterprising managers never before and never since heard
of, drifted in to give three magnificent performances of
the great drama, “ Woman’s Wiles.” There was a full
house on the first night, and Miss Fortescue Jones, who
was playing the clinging but persecuted chief female,
soon wormed her way into the hearts of the gentle miners.
She was tall and pale, and much distressed, and the villain
was utterly despicable. He was a big, ponderous, per-
sistent brute, and never gave the woman half a chance,
pursuing her from pillar to post and home again, and
persecuting with the diabolical purposelessness of the
melodramatic villain who never goes to bed. The third
act was reached, and we came to a powerful moment
where the heroine abandoned herself to her grief, hurled
herself on the mossy bank, and told the villain, “ You are
a dev-hill,” as a preliminary to a piteous appeal. Here the
villain forgot his stage directions and fumbled his part a
bit. He also got in the heroine’s limelight, and threw his
dark shadow across her best bit of facial expression. The
young lady was heard to utter an impatient aside, and
she pushed the bad man off, but the villain was rattled,
and drifted on to obscure the view again. Then, sud-
denly and angrily, the persecuted damsel snatched hold
of him, and dashed him against the scenery. She shook
him with such violence that his false teeth rattled, and
she slapped his painted and frescoed countenance.
“You— —idiot!” she squealed; “do you think I can
act at an audience through your fat carcase?” Then
the villain recovered somewhat, and cursed hoarsely in
his private capacity. He said the limelight was his at
that particular moment, whereat the lady called him a
liar, and, grabbing him once more, tore away his dickey,
and hit him on the head with it. Then, seizing his
walking-stick, she went for him with the fury of a
leading lady robbed of her limelight, and chased him
ignominiously from the stage, and for ten minutes the
racket behind could be heard above the rapturous en-
cores of the audience. Virtue had triumphed.
Luscombe Searelle, the composer of “ Estrella,” who
his first Australian appearance at Newcastle
(Is.S.W.) over 30 years ag*o as pianist to a scraggy variety
CO., is said to have made a big hit in New York with his
latest work, “ Mizpab,” a biblical play set to music.
IN AN OLD-TIME THEATRE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There are certain sentiments that never fail to stir an
audience —the very furniture applauds them.”— Dramatic
Critic.
The theatre was empty, it was dark and very old,
The furniture was ragged, and the roof was stained with
mould.
Here once the melodrama raged, and night by night for
years,
Here virtue fought with villainy, and damped the stage
with tears.
One time the roaring public in that gallery would sit,
And admiring patrons pounded on the flooring of the pit;
But now the rats are nesting in the padding of the stalls,
And beetles in battalions hold reviews upon the walls.
I stood alone upon the stage, where once the villains
roared,
And English heroes postured and defied the foreign
horde.
“Come on!” I cried, “a British tar abhors all wicked-
ness,
And never yet forsook a lovely maiden in distress ! ”
My voice rang through the empty hall, the gathered dust
was stirred,
And something most amazing and miraculous occurred—
There burst a sound of clapping where the thicker
shadows lay,
And from the seats of absent gods quaint voices cried
“ Hooray!”
“ Unhand me, wretch ! ” I shouted, “ I’m a simple village
girl,
But death before dishonor, and I scorn you, noble earl! ”
A squall of scorning music sharply rent the musty air,
And a shout of rapture hurtled from the crowd that
wasn’t there.
“ Ha ! ha ! But who can save you?” (fearful hisses from
the pit!)
“ Fitzgerald Montmorency will! ” I cried, and made a hit.
And, as I left the place of mould, in muttered thunder
tone
I heard the empty theatre still applauding on its own.

The Bulletin hears of an old and
esteemed acquaintance in the shape of Master
Willie Eyers, aged 10 years, of Bolwarrah (Vic.)
and other parts. Willie’s record aroused this
paper’s admiration last January. At that time
young Bill (who had previously run away from
home three times in three months) persuaded his
little brother Arthur to join him in an adven-
turous and piratical career. They borrowed a
pony, a saddle, and an unbroken two-year-old
colt (which Willie rode on bare-backed principles),
and started for N.S. Wales. They l-eaehed the
police-court instead, and Willie was sent
to the Industrial School, to be afterwards
boarded out at Box Hill, near Melbourne. Now
the papers record that Willie’s wanderlust and
"V iking spirit have broken forth afresh. He re-
cently fled from his guardians, and walked back
to his home near Ballarat. The eighty-mile jour-
ney took him a week. Then an unimaginative
“ beak ” sent him to the schools once more.
Willie is too enterprising a boy to be wasted as a
chore-drudge at Box Hill. He should be appren-
ticed to a cattle-lifter or a Territory buffalo-
shooter, or to something in the pearl-diving and
wild-cat line.
The Anti-Sosh fashion-plate canvasser has
struck a new idea which worked very well
indeed till tried on a washer-lady of Pad-
dington (N.S.W.). When informed that the
triumph of the Socialists meant the loss
of her dear little home, the washer-lady’s
eyes gleamed, and she inquired eagerly whose
home she would get in exchange, and speculated
as to whether the new establishment would have
a nice big wardrobe. Her ambition in life was to
have a home “ wid a wardrobe in it, an’a mat,
wid a bunch of flowers painted on it, behind her
wash-handstand.” She whooped for the Socialists
on hearing that her mouldy premises would go to
someone else. The fashion-plate looked un-
comfortable, and played the latest Anti-Sosh
trick. Producing a copy of the roll she scanned
it for a moment. “Why, your name is not on
the roll after all, so you won’t be able to vote for
the Socialists, my good woman ! ” And she
turned to go. Then Bridget arose in her wrath.
‘ Not on the rull, indade. I’d have ye know
twas on only yisterday, and if it’s not there now,
’tis because you’ve struck it off, ye thievin’ wretch
to rob a pore worrukin’ woman of her vote ! ”
Then she reached for the fashion-plate, but that
tall and aristocratically lean lady broke the
record, leaving her ospreys in Bridget’s hands.
The “noton the roll ” gag is unpopular among
lady canvassers in Paddington now.

Thus “ Lewin Crade ” :
I’m a cynical sort of citizen, and I spend a brown cir-
cular coin every morning on the Argus, just to laugh at
its follies. But one day last week I picked up the Age,
and noticed therein a short extract from a pamphlet by
Tunnecliffe (a Victorian Senate candidate) advocating
early marriage as a remedy for prostitution. It was
quitea moral little paragraph, and I thought it hit the
marriage-destruction lie straight between the eyes, and
blackened both of them. I spent three days wondering
why the Age printed it. Finally, I decided that it wished
to help Tunnecliffe’s candidature by demonstrating that
he was a grave and thoughtful man, who was not afraid to
tackle difficult questions. But when I got hold of an
Age this morning again I discovered that quite an ani-
mated discussion was boiling around the extract. One
Robert Walpole referred to the paragraph as “ vile.”
Someone spoke of “Mr. Tunnecliffe’s iniquitous views on
the marriage tie,” while an indignant “Lady Elector”
wants to know “ why Mr. Tunnecliffe does not withdraw
after having been so exposed.” Now, what is the matter?
The thing was perfectly moral, even in the most conven-
tional sense. Are all these people mad, or am I dead,
or is the Age off its skull, so to speak ?

Balderly, of the second-hand odds-and-
ends shop, was unusually irritable a few mornings
ago, and in the course of the day
volunteered an explanation. “Tam

instead of hiding it, threw his last
purchase of stolen spouting in the
doorway.
A large constable’s vanity, or his crude
sense of humor, has got him into bad trouble in
Melbourne. The huge-bodied policeman spoofed
an Age reporter with the yarn that Governor
Talbottle had descended like a god from his car
to shake hands and congratulate him (the cop) on
his traffic-management when on “point duty.”
Talbottle, who is liable to get flustered over very
small things, wrote to the Age angrily denying
that he had entered into any kind of communi-
cation with the stupendous trap, and the Age
passed the letter on to the bobby headquarters,
and headquarters asked the John for a feasible
explanation. The peeler hadn’t one, so head-
quarters fined its copper 30s. for making a false
report to the press, and 30s. more for making a
false statement in official correspondence. Also,
the J. Dunn will take walking exercise on a beat
after this. Which is rough on the vain blue-
bottle.

The morning fixed for taking the bagging
off Colonel Light’s new statue in Adelaide was
almost as bad as anything Adelaide can do in the
way of days. The sun blazed, while an easterly
buster picked up the roads and spread gravel over
the proceedings. Yet the vapid orators bated
never a platitude. Mayor Bruce led off with
thirty-five minutes of weary stodge, and the rest
of them dribbled yards of useless remarks before
the bag was dragged off the statue of the city’s
layer-out. Meanwhile school children kept
standing “to attention” fainted by the half-
dozen. Directly this was done the assemblage
rushed off to buy itself a large wet drink, leaving
the unfortunate officials and school children to
bear the subsequent orations. Why can’t a statue
be deposited on its pedestal during the dark,
stilly night, and just be there in the morning
without saying anything about itself ? The bronze
Colonel had looked like a badly-assorted sack of
vegetables for about a week, yet Adelaide’s
notabilities wouldn’t have the shroud taken away
till they had learned all their unnecessary speeches
off by heart.

THE APOTHEOSIS OF JUDDY.
The programme announced that “The Lion-hearted
Judkins, the true-hearted Judkins, the noble-hearted
Judkins” would be there. He was; so were several
policemen, to take care of him. After a speech by Mr.
Judkins, the chairman, Mr. C. H. Matters, said he had a
little surprise for him. In obedience to signals, a large
square cardboard box was handed up. Mr. Judkins
looked at it in a confused manner. . . . Mr. Judkins was
requested to step forward. Mr. Matters then took from
the box a bushy wreath of ti-tree, relieved by. bush
daisies and linaeria flowers, and lined internally with
cardboard, shaped to fit Mr. Judkins’ head, and formally
crowned Mr. Judkins with it, in the presence of a con-
vulsed assemblage. Mr. Judkins was then embellished
with a long blue ribbon like a Derby winner. It was put
about his neck by Mr. Matters, and twined around his
body. In this very striking guise he addressed the
audience, expressing thanks for the welcome surprise and
appreciation of the kindness which prompted it. He re-
marked: “I assure you I do not regard it as a joke.”—

THE LITTLE BOY AT MANLY : “But it is the
funniest thing I ever saw in my life.”
“ Gnat ” sends a picture of a prohibition
town :
Invercargill (M.L.) is a prohibition town. But that
doesn’t mean that Invercargill doesn’t drink. In fact, it
has two breweries and keeps both of them going. They
brew the liquor in the town ; but as they can’t sell it there
they cart it to the adjoining electorate, on the town
boundary, and sell it in two-gallon and five-gallon kegs.
The Saturday night rush for these kegs has become an
institution. The Customs returns show that the Sep-
tember thirst took 10,060 gallons before it was drowned,
while in October it took 13,071 gallons. In a town of
12,000 inhabitants this may be considered a fairly decent
performance for a month. The average beer trade of the
hotels (15)in the days of license was about fifteen hogs-
heads each per month, or 225 hogsheads in all ; under
prohibition it represents about 260 hogsheads all told.
The only difference is, that instead of drinking in pubs.,
those so disposed have orgies in stables, sheds, under
bridges, in ditches, and behind gorsebushes. What
national prohibition might do I don’t know, but the
system under which you can follow a beer-cart across the
street, and buy from it more than you want, is a fool of a
system.

This passion for men of the sea isn’t a new
thing. A divorce petitioner told Yic. Justice
Gussen, the other day, that after he had brought
his best girl out from the Cold Country and
married her, she only dwelt with him a wqek.
Then she departed without saying good-bye.
After long search he found her serving drinks in a
city bar, whereupon she showed him the photo, of
a ship’s officer and said, “That is the man I ought
to have married ” ; also she fervently stated that
she would never return to him. That was 20 years
ago, which seems to show that he was a very
gradual man. Perhaps that was the difference be-
tween the two; there is nothing dilatory about
the average ship’s officer when pursuing a girl.
He would sooner break his neck than be a bad
second in the race.

Not only are the Federal electors alive to
their democratic possibilities, but they are being
held in this glad state —or the male section are—
by a wise alliance with D.C.L. whisky. D.C.L.
strikes the key-note of wisdom, and does so in a
manner so harmonious and comforting that even
the she-electors are glad to see their mankind
occasionally struck thereby. It is better than
any other sort of strike so far invented for the
mitigation of the human lot, which, alas ! is
mostly a bad lot.*
One day during Cup week half-a-dozen
people witnessed an episode in the career of a
tall gentleman, in the grey frock-coat and squat
grey topper of a superior sport. It hap-
pened in the vestibule of a Melbourne hotel.
Ihe tall gentleman came languidly down-
stairs, pulling on a lemon-yellow glove, and
looking just the thing, when a matron
swooped upon him, called him a bad word,
and struck his belltopper an awful blow
with her gamp. Then she repeated her re-
markf and smote the hapless man where his
hair was growing thin. She followed this
up with some sentences about her feelings as a
mother and the sanctity of the home, and hit
out with her gamp again at the terrified and
expostulating gentleman, and continued smiting
till her weapon was just a bundle of wires and
torn silk. Then she burst into tears, and
informed the thrilled onlookers that this raven-
ing lion in lambswool had enticed her daughter
from a happy home and a virtuous life.
The man in grey denied the accusa-
tion with splendid indignation, and
mopped up the gore that streamed
from his damaged nose in a silk
handkerchief the while. He
had never seen the woman
before in his life ; he knew
nothing of her daughter;
he was a highly honorable
Sydney citizen, and his
v wife was upstairs, and
would testify to his
honesty, sobri-
ety, and the
assiduity with
which he lived
thesimplelife.
The convic-
tions of the
injured mother
were shaken. She
looked doubtingly
upon the stranger in
grey, her face paled,
her voice faltered.
“ Then, if you’re not
the villain,” she said,
“I’ll like to know
who’s goin’ to pay
for my ruined um-
brella ? ”

Some wearisome
people in Vic. coun-
try towns are agi-
tating for legislation to empower a reduc-
tion of the width of their main streets, the
reason given being that wide thoroughfares are
“ bad for business.” What a fearful and wonder-
ful thing the Kyabramapootra brain must be
when it imagines that people who buy a pound of
sugar at thelocal store now would buy a pound
and a half if the shop on the other side was close
enough to keep out the light and air ! If the
theory works out, they shouldn’t stop at asking
for a reduction from three chains to 50ft. It
would only require a further reduction to make
every place flow with milk and honey• while
those townships with streets that George Reid
couldn’t squeeze through would be populated
with millionaires.

Justice Hood ran through 30 cases at last
Melbourne Divorce sittings, and the weariful
tales got on his nerves, so that towards the end
he spoke plain words. One of the petitioners was
a lady whose husband had gone to England on
August 28th, ’O3. He had written from Perth
(W. A.) and from Africa—then all word ceased.
His Honor observed that the lady had been in a
tremendous hurry to start proceedings, seven
days after the legal period of desertion was up.
He opined that possibly the missing husband
was ill, or his business was very engrossing, or he
might accidentally have forgotten all about his
wife. Still he gave the lady her decree, which
was a very sensible thing to do ; for if a lady can’t
start proceedings three years after desertion,
what is three years mentioned for ? And three
years doesn't mean three years and two
weeks —it doesn’t even mean three years and
one week. It means just three years. Another
petitioner was a farmer who had acquired
the beginnings of a family about three months
after the wedding, which undue haste so annoyed
him that he practically deserted his wife. Justice
Hood assured this gentleman that he was asking
for divorce because of his wife’s ante-nuptial
giddiness, but that the law didn’t take notice of
that sort of giddiness. Another lady informed
his Honor that her husband had literally kicked
her out of the house, and told her to go and earn
her own living, but Mr. Hood said that the kick-
out wasn’t desertion, it was only boots, and he
hung up the matter for further evidence.
“ A wood ” complains bitterly from Ade-

the kitchen, “ Roast lamb for Mr. John Downier.”
I expected to hear her call out “ Mr. Ohewhard’s
tripe ” when ordering mine, but she didn’t.
Why is this ?
Is John Downer’s serve cut off a blue-blooded iamb?
I think there must be something in it. I’m going to
find out the cause of this injurious differentiation, as
Bruce Smith calls it, and if there is no explanation there
will be another Habibulla tragedy, only worse.

The only people who profited by the fire that

(Maoriland) lately was the safe and strongroom firm,
Chubb, of London and the world generally. The Bank of

Bank, and a number of others, all report that the docu-
ments and lucre stored in Chubb’s safes and strongrooms

little things that it cares about behind doors of Chubb’s
manufacture, and sleeps quietly at night in consequence,
and the good example has been followed by the Commer-

houses into mating-houses ; but where could a young
man find a better wife than in the church, and where

gress.
When the amorous Baptist searcheth for a maid
(Oh, my brethren, hug your knees and roll your eyes !)
He will catch her in the cosy picnic glade,
Where the hoary Deacon winks with knowledge wise.
When he’s seized with sudden longing to be wed
To a damsel with a longing of her own
(Oh my sister, rub my shoulder with your head!)
He can find her in the vestry all alone.
In the twilight of the silent summer eve,
When the air is full of Love’s poetic fire
(Oh, slide within the circle of my sleeve !)
He can meet her coming homeward from the choir.
When the Dorcas club’s embroidery is done,
When the Young Men’s Christian Union ends its day,
We will breathe a Benediction while they run
To cuddle in the old familiar way.
For everybody settles Cupid’s debts,
And the little god, as rosy as of yore,
Smiles blandly on the holy amourettes,
Beginning just as even-song is o’er.
He spreads his wide domain o’er land and sea,
And he chuckles in the pulpit full of joy,
While the pretty Baptist maid, in laughing glee,
Sits smooging with the blissful Baptist boy.

A quaint little case that should have been
settled in the children’s court was brought up
before Sydney Police Magistrate Wilsliire last
week. The prosecutrix was a pretty, well-dressed
child-woman of about 18, with a small speck of a
baby in her arms. She was a quiet little woman,
and it was a perfectly tame baby. The defendant
was her husband, a nice boy of 19. Apparently
they had married, sparrow fashion, on nothing a
week, and had lived with their respective parents.
One night the little woman wouldn’t come in
and play the child’s game of “ludo” at her
husband’s place, and after this disagreement they
felt that all the world was The husband
apparently pulled his hat down fiercely over his
eyes, and went off up country to shear sheep, if
he could find any small enough. The wife
finally proceeded against him for lack of the
maintenance that, apparently, had never been,
and she came into court with a blush and
the small baby to tell the story of how their
dolls’ house had been broken. She blushed
something extra when asked if she was still fond
of her boy, and admitted shyly that she was. She
didn’t want him sent to prison; she really only
desired to have the dolls’ house repaired. The
P.M. couldn’t find any statute to meet the case.
Statutes are large, hard things, which are not to
be thrown at butterflies with impunity, and he
wanted something feathery with a silk lining. So
he spoke like a father to the complainant—like an
extra-peaceful father, lest the little woman should
cry and wake up the very small baby—and, by the
time he had finished, the dolls’ house was so nicely
repaired that you could hardly see the breakage.

Melbourne is still haunted by its flying
thief. He attacks tall warehouses from the top
windows, and he prefers them tall, for then there
is less care taken about fastening the top win-
dows. Basements and doors he scorns. Once
a clerk, who was working on Saturday afternoon
or Sunday in a room near the clouds, saw the
winged marauder at the window, but when he
hid collected his senses sufficiently to look out
there was nothing visible save a fly on the wall.
The flying thief has now scuttled among the
hiuse-tops for over a year, and the roofs of
Melbourne are still his special property.

“ I suppose your husband does everything you

“ Oh, dear no! You see he knows I don't

Overheard in a fashionable Sydney shop.
One of the Smart Set was investing in a very
expensive Bridge outfit. She said she must have
English cards ; in fact, she could not understand
how anybody could possibly play with any others.
The assistant explained that there was 6d. duty
on each pack of imported cards. She was furious,
and, when she was selecting her set, ventured to
“suppose the awful Socialism had also heavily
taxed that.” “Yes,” said the affable assistant,
“games and fancy goods pay 20 per cent. !” This
just about completed the knock-out. “No wonder
all decent people love Mr. George Reid, who is a
Freetrader, and only advocates putting a duty on
luxuries and removing it off such necessaries as
these, ” said the Smart Set.

Regarding a paragraph in this column
(22/11/’O6), The Bulletin hears from the N.S.W.
Police Department that that organisation has
never used the “ Bertillon ” system of identifica-
tion, but has lately adopted, and with much
success, the Henry system of identification by
finger prints. Said system was designed by E. R.
Henry, Commissioner of London Police.
Traveiling on the Victorian railways is a
hungry business, for the meals, such as they are,
come along hours behind their proper time. The
cause of this is mostly the dirt on the engine.
When the refreshment rooms were built, they
were positioned so as to fit in with mealtimes.
Trains then used to trot along. Now they have
dropped to a walk, and the refreshment rooms
have all moved an hour or two further on, for the
trains only arrive later—they don’t start earlier.
The Victorian traveller leaves Spencer-street for
anywhere at about 6 a.m. He breakfasts at any
old time between 9 and 11 a.m.—it all depends on
the amount of dirt that hasn’t fallen off the
engine. Dinner arrives as much on the wrong
side of 2 p.m. as is possible—that’s if the train
hasn’t been stuck up at some station where there
is only a tap and a tin drinking mug. Tea at
night, provided the border hasn’t been crossed,
is obtainable between seven and eight. That is
on the main lines. When you get off them and
start to wander in “mixed” trains or “Limericks”
over branch lines, you have to give up all thought
of meals; for you’ll often travel for three-quarters
of a day without seeing a refreshment bar. But
the Government probably doesn’t want anyone to
travel on the branch lines—the more people that
travel on them, the greater is the Department’s
compensation bill.

Australia’s imported navy made the usual
mess of things in Sydney Harbor last week. The
worn-out Pegasus had started for England, but
after slipping its moorings it was found that the
imposing but useless Pah’f’l was tailing right
across Farm Cove. This fact might have been
noticed earlier, but wasn’t. The Pegasus had
either to stop indefinitely or go round by the
rocks, as the flagship quite blocked the gangway.
It chose to go round by the rocks, and deposited
its propeller thereon, which necessitated an ex-
pensive trip to the dock. The Pah’f’l is a large,
hulking, commodious brute, which can only
amble safely around the harbor at high water, and
uses most of the harbor in its amblings, and it
seems to have an immeasurable capacity for
getting in the road.

“Num” : One of the worst examples of
the gambling mania I ever saw will not be reached
by Premier Oarruthers’
repressive measure. At
2.30 one winter’s morn-
ing, about two years
ago, I was walking to
my home in Padding-
ton, and caught sight
of two youngsters,
both under ten, stand-
ing ankle-deep in the
mud under a big arc
light. I crossed and
found them so intent
they didn’t notice my
approach. Each held
in one hand a bunch of
cards. “Why don’t
you boys go home to
bed ? ” I asked in stern,
J udkins-like tones.
The nearest suddenly
awoke. Glancing up,
he replied, “Not me.
I’ve got tuppence left,
an’ I’m goin’ ter see
it through. I’m a
game sport, I am. See
yer,” he added to his
companion. The latter
had only a pair, and
the twopence became
threepence. I left them
playing. When I re-
turned at 10.30 they
had gone. Somebody
had departed ; to his
home broken, dis-
pirited and ruined.

“D.” : It was men-

I faring case that the
gold-laced and spot-

fifth officers on the P. and
O. passenger boats draw
the handsome remuneration
of £1 a week (with their keep,
&c., of course). Yet the fourth
officer on a P. and O. boat is somebody.
Even if he doesn’t keep a regular watch, he is
generally in charge of the chief officer’s, and
should anything happen, is liable to blossom at a
moment’s notice into the full responsibility of a
watch-keeping officer, in charge of half a million
of money and 500 lives. And he gets the pay of a
generally useless on a farm.

The large illumination of a K.C., and the
milder radiance of four other lights of the N.S.W.
Bar shed themselves last week before Justice
Cohen, sitting in Equity, re the disposal of £45.
This affluence was at stake among the members
of a family which had journeyed all the way
from Young to have the case decided. The
Justice said it was a shocking business, and sug-
gested a settlement, and he suggested it so firmly
that the large illumination, and the four dimmer
radiances, and all their paraphernalia of solicitors,
and attorneys, and clerks, went out and settled.
The legal talent was so large, and the case so
small, that it looked like the army of Xerxes
bearing down on a grasshopper. As for the mere
imperceptible speck of £45, it had vanished in
costs long before the family started from Young
to look at its case.

Adelaide, which had not a single outdoor

going strong in that line. Along North Terrace
are, an equestrian figure in honor of the farm-
burners killed in S’Africa, also Bobby Burns and

to the road) W. W. Hughes and Thomas Elder.
In Victoria Square are Queen Victoria and
Hercules, McDouall Stuart and Colonel Light
(Light and Hughes were both set up last week.)
Now Sturt the explorer, Torrens of the Real
Property Act, and Ridley of the reaper are being
inquired for.

The latest Juddyism :
At the conclusion of his remarks, Mr. Judkins called
upon the audience to cease applauding what he had said,
and to stand up in silence, as if in horror. The audience
complied, and resumed their seats in silence, and then
departed.
A time may yet come when Judkins, after one of
his wild orations, will ask the audience to fall
down as if in convulsions, and intimate that those
who desire to froth at the mouth can procure soap
in the vestry.
THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.
(Scene down our street.)
“She called me a Freetrader ,
an’ me a respectable married
woman! ”
The sleeplessness of the unsatisfied
creditor is a disheartening thing. One Frederick
Bruce died in Melbourne just 18 years ago, leav-
ing sundry creditors lamenting. Recently, from
England, there came to the late Bruce’s wife the
sum of £2300, being deceased’s share in an uncle’s
estate. She had hardly got wind of the glad
tidings before a bland gentleman was on the door-
step, pressing for the balance of the late Bruce’s
18 year-old account. An appeal to law resulted
in the amount of the legacy being ordered into
the Bruce debt liquidation pool—after subtraction
of united costs. Even a glass-eyed creditor can’t
approach Costs for wakefulness.

these dames who create an uproar about the
tearing up of the marriage lines are really in
terror lest they should have to explain, when
Watson comes round with the tearing apparatus,
that they haven’t any.
“ O.K. ” : A feuLLETLN advt. submits pic-
tures of three smart upstanding skirts under the
unnecessary question “Do These Skirts Appeal

in the advt., which give free scope to the imagi-
nation.

“The Slave”: Melbourne newspaper men,
in an attack of gregariousness, decided to form a
club, or something. A committee was appointed,
and it has worked out an arrangement. The club
is to affiliate, or brotherise, with the Melbourne
Stock Exchange Club, a big residential concern.
The newspaper men will all be members of the
Stock Exchange Club, with all its privileges and
its rights and its wild cats ; also, they will have a
room of their own, to which Stock Exchange
members will not have the entree. Member-
ship of the new club will carry with it the
right of admission to Stock Exchange clubs all
over the world, and also to other Press clubs,
while visiting pressmen can be made honorary
members of the new club with surprising ease.
The committee had great struggles for a name,
and it went to South Africa for one. The sug-
gested title is “The Press Bond”—not “The
Silken Thread” or “The Inky Yoke,” but
“ The Press Bond.” Members, presumably, will
be “Bondsmen.” Nobody thought apparently
of “ The Press Gang. ” However, the committee
doesn’t want to callits little show a club because
it proposes to extend the affair into a benefit in-
stitution and to gain rights and privileges that
would not be accorded to an ordinary club.
Whatever it calls itself, the idea is a good one.
Melbourne has been a desert for visiting press-
men, and the inky toilers of the city have had no
place but the street or a pub. where they could
enjoy even a Swiss cigar in unison.

“ Snell ” : I notice that the Victorian
Government has accepted a tender for school
books, and one of the conditions reads:—“The
blocks and plates for illustration may be prepared
outside, but the printing must be done in
Victoria.” This apparently means that the local
artist is reckoned by Bent and Co. a no-account
f erson, and not deserving of any encouragement.
t is the old, stupid prejudice against Australian
art that is characteristic of the dull devils who
manage our affairs. Australia can send artists to
England to take good places as illustrators, but
Bent isn’t at all sure that it can show any clever
enough to do elementary drawings of the school-
kid variety. Isn’t it about time to waken these
leather-headed Parliamentarians to the idea that
native art is worthy of some trifling portion of
the encouragement that is extended to native
industry?

THE SHORTEST CUT TO HEAVEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Those who die for the Fatherland will receive eternal
rewards. —Kaiser William’s latest.
One pathway to Eternal Life
Bears blanky signs of human strife ;
Spent cannon-balls and bits of shell
Sweet stories of salvation tell,
And sermons, sometimes preached by stones,
Are uttered there by rotting bones -5
Of them who died whilst showing fight,
And joined the angels clothed in white.
All men who fall with gun in hand
March to the Better Fatherland;
Their souls are saved—which fact we know
Because the Kaiser tells us so.
And in this truth we find, indeed,
Encouragement to Christian Creed ;
For, if a slaughtered soldier’s ghost
Gets numbered with the Heavenly Host,
We should invoke, upon our knees,
God’s blessings on our enemies !
Fight on, ye brave ! Whilst lost in doubt
Concerning what the war’s about;
Fix bayonets, and charge the heights,
And let your liver or your lights
Receive the foeman’s steely thrust,
Rejoicing as ye bite the dust.
Then, having met a hero’s fate,
Proceed to Peter at the Gate,
And say : “ Great servant of the Lord,
Behold ! I perished by the sword.”
(Or bullet, as the case may be)—
“ I guess there’s room inside for me.”
And Peter, smiling in your face,
Will answer : “ Welcome ! child of grace ;
The waves that wash the Golden Shore
Will cleanse you of your clotted gore ;
Go, stand on guard beside the Throne,
A private in The Kaiser’s Own.”

The WILDCAT
COLUMN
Statistician Drake, of Victoria, in the “Vic-
torian Year Book, 1905” —part XI., just published—has
a table showing- the net burden of the funded debts of
the States for that year. Here are the salient features: —
Debt Not Net
Total Covered by Burden
Funded Earnings and per
Debt. Sinking Funds. head.
Victoria .. £51,513,767 £5,432,666 £4 9 7
N.S. Wales .. 80,594,372 . 20,538,998 13 18 7
Westralia .. 16,642,773 3,712,638 14 16 9

Queensland .. 39,068,827 18,511,524 35 4 3
Tasmania .. 9,307,456 6,818,639 38 0 9
Maoriland .. 59,912,000 23,973,572 27 14 3
But these figures relate to funded debts only. They also
do not take into account municipal and corporation
debts. These latter, together with the unfunded
debts, amounted for Australia —without Maoriland—to
£27,099,280 on J une 30, 1905, equal to £6 14s. lid. per
head of population at that date. The unfunded debt
was wholly unproductive, but how much of the municipal
debt was earning its own keep it is impossible to say.
The proportion would, however, be so extremely small as
to be an almost negligible quantity. Taking it as such,
these figures will be got:—
Funded Unfunded Total
Debt not and Muni- Burden

Westralia .. £3,712,638 £493,821 £l6 16 3

N.S. Wales .. 20,538,998 6,100,499 18 1 4
S. Australia .. 8,723,072 1,619,537 27 12 1
Queensland .. 18,511,524 1,923,907 38 17 6
Tasmania .. 6,'18,639 914,080 43 2 9
The earnings of the reproductive works are for the year
ended June 30th, 1905, and that was an unusually profit-
able year. In a bad year the debt not covered by net
earnings is twice as great. Thus in 1903 in N.S. Wales the
funded debt not provided for by the net earnings of
reproductive or partly reproductive works amounted to
£34,912,000, which was equal to £24 18s. 4d. per head of
the population at that time ; and to that had to be added
the unfunded and municipal debt. The figures in the
tables above, therefore, show' the position under the
most favorable circumstances. In other words, even
when Australian public works are earning- the most, as
the result of a boom season, there is a debt amounting to
from £l6 16s. 3d. to £43 2s. 9d. per head, interest on
which has to be provided either out of taxation or out of
further loans. This means that an average household
must be taxed to pay interest on from £B5 to £215, and
that is more calculated to break up the home than most
things.
If the finances were considered as any ordinary
commercial concern would view them, the results would
certainly be less satisfactory than they are represented
here. Apart from the fact that nothing is charged
against earnings to cover general depreciation, it is
an admitted fact that in many cases ordinary repairs
and maintenance are neglected. Repeatedly the S. Aus-
tralian Railway Commissioner, for one, has drawn atten-
tion to that. The earnings really available for interest
are, therefore, less than is shown ; for the charges for
maintenance, &c., are not being got rid of, but are simply
being deferred, and will have to be faced some day. Then
there is the larger question of replacement. Most of the
things into winch the borrowed money has been put dis-
placed other things less than 50 years ago. The chances
are that these things will themselves be displaced long
before another 50 years are passed. Some of them have,
in fact, been displaced already—twice over, in some cases.
First, the steam trams went, then the cable trams.
Steain railways may, to a great extent, disappear in the
same way; likewise, the present telegraph system.
Many private commercial concerns recognise all
this, and provide accordingly. The Melbourne
Hydraulic Power 00. has a fund for the return of capital;
so has the Melbourne Tramway 00. Certainly these cos.
have leases merely ; but they were satisfied to take leases
because they had no faith in their power-scheme being
the power-scheme of more than, say, 30 years. And they
were right; for traction purposes, at any rate, the cable
is already antiquated. But though many of the State’s
works have either become out of date, or almost for a
certainty will become out of date, no provision worth
mentioning is being- made for the return of capital—for
the repayment, that is, of the debt. At June 30, 1905,
while the total Australian funded debt was £224,685,540,
the accumulated sinking funds, built.up out of earnings,
were only' £2,175,752. There ought to be provided a
sinking fund nnd a replacement fund—a sinking fund to
pay off the old debt and a replacement fund to provide
the new works without getting into new debt; and prac-
tically there is neither. The whole of the net earnings
go to pay interest; and even then they leave a debt to be
provided for out of taxation equal to from £B5 to £215
per household.
The Anti-Socialist crowd would have some sort
of a case if it said that the State in Australia has proved
itself a reckless financier ; and the Socialist crowd would
have a great deal better case if it showed itself determined
upon financial honesty and business prudence. But Anti-
Sosh is an even more reckless financier than the other.
It is particularly interested in cutting down taxation ;
that is to say, it particularly' interests itself in preventing
the proper charges being made against the revenue of
the business undertakings for maintenance, replacement
and sinking funds. Also, it particularly interests itself
in getting concessions on railway freights, etc., and
making the provision for maintenance, replacement, and
sinking fund impossible. In particular it Opposes the
progressive land-tax ; in other words.it wants to drive
the settler so far out into the country that to make it
worth while taking his produce to market at all the
railways will have to carry it at a rate so low that they
won’t be able to make provision for maintenance, replace-
ment, and sinking fund ; or it wants to force him to pay
the present landlord so much that he won’t be able to
pay the railways enough to allow them to make the
provision before mentioned. There is a case to be made
out against Socialism as it has been practised in Aus-
tralia ; but the Anti-Socialists don’t make it. On the
contrary, they' propose to go on practising Socialism,
but to do it under conditions that must mean either a
smash or an awful struggle in the future to avoid the
smash.
The most savage insurance fight that Australia
has seen for many a day has broken out in Westralia. It
has been threatening for a couple of years. Eighteen
months ago, how'ever, an agreement was drawn up, pro-
viding for a tariff ; and all the offices doing business in
the West pledged themselves hard and fast to stick to it.
It was necessary to make the pledge thorough because it
was know’n that one or tw'o offices, which hadn’t got
much of a footing in the State, wanted a chance to cut
in and make up for lost time. It has been know'n
for some months that the agreement was being
strained, if nothing w'orse was happening to it, and finally
a bad breach and an ineffective settlement gave
one or two of the biggest foreign cos. the pretext they
wanted. They consequently withdrew from the agree-
ment, which, of course, meant smashing the tariff, and
then the war started by the big foreigners dumping in
insurance at utterly unprofitable rates —down to 6d. per
cent, per annum. The object was twofold—to knock out
the comparatively small (because young) Australian
offices, and to grab some of the business which has
been done hitherto by other big foreign concerns—
in particular, the Commercial Union—which were
either earlier in the field, or worked it more ener-
getically. The process is much the same as the
“ dumping ”of goods by the foreign manufacturer. And
the result will be, no doubt, the same in the end ; that is
to say, no sooner will the “dumpers” have cleared the
field of some competitors, and got the business on their
own books at the present ridiculous rates, than they will
put up the price ; and the public will then have to pay
extra to make up for the cos.’ present losses. There
doesn’t seem to be any effective way of dealing by law
with the big foreigner who dumps insurance into Aus-
tralia ; but the Australian can deal with that sort of
practice and that sort of co. without waiting for any law.

Twelve months ago attention was drawn to the fact that
the report of this bank contained no balance-sheet. This
obvious deficiency is being remedied by an amending
Bill now before the Westralian Parliament; though it is
an extraordinary thing that an amending Bill should be
needed. Since the previous amending Bill, which came
into force in 1903, extending the powers of the bank, and
allowing it, for one thing, to make advances to pay off
existing liabilities, the figures have been moving up
rapidly. That amending Bill, however, contained the
stupid provision that, though a man might have borrowed
elsewhere to complete the improvement of his holding, he
could not borrow from the State bank to pay off the old
debt unless he borrowed a third mare than the old debt and
put the extra third into new improvements—an inex-
plicable provision, the result of which is to load a settler
with debt and interest for unnecessary improvements.
Presumably the new bill knocks out that provision ; and
it is time, for it is about the last idea that anybody who
really wanted to help the settler would think of. The
reserves are held by the Treasurer to meet possible
losses ; whether, however, there have been any losses to
cut into these reserves cannot be said in the absence of a
balance-sheet; also, nothing can be said very definitely
as to whether there are overdue repayments outstanding.
Costs are coming down as advances increase. On this
point here are the figures :

1906 .. 96,564 394,164 70,699 015 9
It is claimed that the cost of the improvements effected
with the aid of the advances now covered by mortgage
has been £608,145 plus £39,281 spent on stock and plant;
and that seems safe enough banking, unless the improve-
ments have been put in the most hopeless places—as
to that, of course, the figures are no guide. As to costs,
here is a comparison of the four Australasian State land
banks, whose figures for the year have been published :
Advances Expenses

Maoriland .. £3,125,069 .. ss. Id. p.c.

The farmer who wants assistance may get a hint here
that there is something to be said for that nationalisa-
tion of monopolies which he is being just now invited to
curse so comprehensively. A big concern, it seems, can
be run at about one-fifth the cost of a little concern ; the
only trouble is that, when a concern grows big, unless
the public that uses it also owns it, the users don’t get
the benefit of the economy.

The situation is none too clear, but that is apparently
how the matter stands. According to the reconstructed
articles, a part of the profits must be set aside to buy
deferred inscribed stock for cancellation. Formerly the
total of the amounts thus used was shown as “ capital
reserve, being difference between the cost and the
nominal amount of the bank’s perpetual stocks purchased
and cancelled, including stocks purchased out of profits.”
In 1905 this reserve was written off, and assets were
written down to match. Last year £7193 was set aside
out of profits ; and as the stocks were reduced by £8990,
apparently a profit of £1797 was made. As this £8990
has disappeared from the balance-sheet, assets must also
have been written down to that extent. Apart from this

removing the old trouble is shown hereunder (between
1896 and 1900 the total was reduced from £3,845,350 to
£3,176,074): —

The £2,672,734 is made up as follows
(1) £983,547 perpetual debenture stock, 4 per cent., re-
payable on six months’ notice at 5 per cent,
premium.
(2) £889,419 perpetual preferred stock, 3 per cent.
(3) £799,768 redeemable stock, 3 per cent., with an
“ extra 1J per cent, under certain circumstances,
interest payable out of profits.
As for the share capital, £lO of the £2O per share was
written off in 1893 ; then, in 1897, the other £lO went
(total £900,000). Meantime £l2 10s. per share had been
called up, though onty 43,155 shares were kept alive.
Under the first reconstruction, this bank paid
4J p.c. and 4 p.c. on the old deposits—an average of 4J ; .
p.c. In 1896 the interest bill was £164,389. By 1900,
through repayments and the amendment of the foolish,
impossible old scheme, the interest burden was down to
£109,955. Last year it was £90,000 —or it would have
been those round figures if it had been fivepence more.
In 1596 the gross profits were £220,896 (out of that,
management, salaries, rent, and the £164,389 before-
mentioned had to be paid); last year the gross profits
were £249,043 (and out of that, besides management,
salaries, and rent, only £90,000 had to be paid). Cer-
tainly management, &c., costs more now ; all the same,
it is a fine recovery in 10 years.

The striking feature is the increase in advances. No
doubt safe securities can be got even now ; yet any large
jump in advances is to be viewed at present with some
suspicion and mistrust. Still, so far as new depositors
are concerned, the position is one of perfect safety. The
liquid assets represent no less than 53 per cent, of all
new liabilities ; and reckoning the reconstructed deposits
as capital, the new depositors’ and other creditors’
interest in the non-liquid assets is only 38 per cent, of
their book value; in other words, all creditors not
covered by the reconstruction could be paid with the
liquid assets and the non-liquid assets even if the latter
only realised 38 per cent, of their present book value.
Exclusive of anything made by buying old deposits at a
discount, the shareholders' fund (capital and reserves)
earned £7 2s. Id. per cent, last year ; and, especially
considering the interest that first had to be paid, that is
good enough proof that the book value of assets is a long
way better than 38 per cent, of the true value.
Summed up, the position with regard to the
E.S. and A. Bank, from a share point of view, is that in a
good time it ought to show up remarkably well, owing to
the large amount of deposits (old and otherwise) it has in
proportion to its capital; but in a bad time, when earn-
ings are poor and risks too great to take, the shareholders
will have an unusually cold time, because (unlike a bank
in an ordinary position) it will have to go on paying
interest on this vast bulk of deposits whether it can use
them or not. And that’s why a strong reserve fund
should be built up in such a rare good time as the present,
instead of grabbing the chance to increase the dividend.

The principal assets of this energetic co. are “advances
on land, stations, stock, wool and other produce, includ-
ing property held by the c 0.,” which, with customers’
balances, etc., total £5,109,102—a pretty large and
comprehensive item. With an item of that character
and that size in the published accounts, it is almost
impossible to tell from them how things are really
shaping; for so much depends upon the provision
(if any) which is being made out of profits for deprecia-
tion and probable losses. You can’t trace that provision
(if any) with accuracy in the accumulation of cash and
liquid assets either, because in a property-owning busi-
ness of this sort, with so much of the property only
partly improved, the provision for depreciation, &e., may
go into fixed improvements or extension of property. All
that can be said is that it looks as though the co. were
run on very safe lines financially. It was formed in 1884.
The next year it paid 7 p.c., and then for 16 years,
right on to 1901, it paid an unvarying 8 p.c.—paid
just its 8 p.c., while some other cos., in the pastoral-
finance business were paying 12 and 15 p.c., or
more ; then in droughty 1902, though it showed
more than enough to pay 8 p.c., it pulled its
dividend down to 7 p.c. because the outlook was very
bad. And it looks as though the profits were really
earned ; for if accumulated interest were being piled up
on to the advances, the latter wouldn’t be likely to show
the actual decrease that they do. The increase in liquid
assets might also be pointed to ; but as against that, of
course, is the fact that liabilities of all sorts increased
during the past year by £506,954. Here, however, are the
figures relating to these movements in more detail: —

Altogether, it is a co. whose financial record commands
uncommon respect; it locks as though it might easily
issue much more gaudy reports if it were that sort of co.
In particular, it looks as though it prefers to write down
values out of profits rather than build up visible reserves.
Its burden of debenture debt is a good deal less oppres-
sive than it was 10 years ago, and in view of that and of
its larger reserves, to say nothing of the possible writing
down of assets through the process of providing other
assets out of profits, it ought to be easier for it to earn 8
per cent, now than it was in the long stretch of former
years. (The co. last year, by the way, paid £5OOO out of
profits as the nucleus of a staff benevolent fund ; this has
been deducted from the profit shown above.) From an
investment point of view, Dalgety’s are, nevertheless,
rather handicapped by a £l5 per share liability (£5 paid)
—a liability which is all the more to be remembered be-
cause of the large extent of the terminable debentures
and the current liabilities.

In both departments there has been a satisfactory ex-
pansion of business; and the accounts in other respects
show good figures. The expense rate has moved up a
trifle iii the Ordinary branch ; but this is partly due to
the appearance of a new item, £250 having been charged
ao-ainst the revenue of each branch for a staff fidelity
fund. Though this fund is still intact, it has been
regarded as an outlay, the amount being no longer at
the disposal of policy-holders. In the Industrial branch,
though still just upon half of the total income is absorbed
by expenses, there is a slight shrinkage in the percentage

The one serious doubt in connection with these figures,
in the Industrial branch especially, is whether they are
not being benefited by the inclusion of a very large pro-
portion of very unsatisfactory business. The report
of the last actuarial investigation (1905) showed
that the largest proportion of industrial business
was under endowment tables; and that is the very
poorest sub-branch of a very poor branch of insur-
ance. Thus, for instance, in case of death before the
endowment period expires, only the premiums come
back to the “insured” family. This certainly makes
things easier for the society ; but the inclusion of this
poor sort of insurance casts aspersions on both the total
figures and the expense rate. On the other hand,
nothing but praise is due for the change in the form of
the society’s investments. The high rate hitherto
earned has been due to the very large proportion of
funds out on mortgage. Owing to the cheapening of
money, this society, like some others, has apparently de-
cided that it isn’t any longer worth while taking mort-
gage risks at the price ; and the money is going into
Government and municipal securities instead. (It
is striking, by the way, how anti-socialists, when
they want a safe thing, go for Socialistic securities.) The
immediate result is that, whereas in 1905 only 26 per
cent, of the total funds were represented by these assets,
the proportion is now 39 per cent.—a spring from
£126,815 to £219,723 in the year. This, of course, must
mean a reduction in the interest earnings; but in the
present accounts it doesn’t show itself seriously. Six
years’ figures are as follow :
Interest Earned on Average Funds.
1901 ..£4 10 3 per cent. I 1904 ..£4 Q 1 per cent.
1902 .. 4 9 4 „ „ 1905 .. 410 6 „ „
1903 .. 4 8 8 „ „ I 1906 .. 4 9 1 „ „
The cost of the T. and G.’s new business charged to the
Ordinary branch is amazingly small. The total cost was
£21,026. The renewal premiums were £61,731. If they
cost 7 per cent., the total for that business would be
£4321 ; this, disregarding the very trifling annuity
business, would allow £16,705 for the cost of new
business ; and the new-business premiums were £19,258.
That means that the cost charged to Ordinary depart-
ment was only 87 per cent, of the new-business premiums.
On the same basis the cost of the A.M.P.’s new business
last year was 89 per cent. ; of the National Mutual’s, 127
per cent. Either the T. and G. is extraordinarily well
organised, or the Industrial business is being loaded with
a good deal of the Ordinary department’s expenses.

From New York :—“ The opinion of an ex-Aus-
tralian may be of value afj this moment regarding the ‘ Big
Three’ Life Insurance cos. The investigation, recently
concluded, disclosed a rotten state of affairs, and sent
McOall, of the New York Life, to an early grave, Alexan-
der, of the Equitable, to a sanatorium, and McCurdy, of
the Mutual, to exile in Paris. Had political considera-
tions not halted the enquiry, u- questionably a greater
exposure would have been made. The net benefit to
policy-holders was that a certain number of the directors
were forced out, but unfortunately not sufficient to
change the policy of the companies, which is a policy of
wading up to their necks in Wall-street syndicates. By
a new law just in force, the policy-holders have, for the
first time, the power to elect their own officers, and it is
hoped that they will use their proxies wisely. The exist-
ing managements are doing their utmost to continue in
control, and, as they have the policy-holders’ money to
do this with, it is possible that they will win. They have
retained a well-known lawyer to undertake the task of
getting proxies for them, with a fee of fifty thousand
dollars ; a minimum sum of one million dollars is guar-
anteed for ‘ expenses.’ All Australian policy-holders
will readily realise that only notices favorable to the
companies will be issued from this source. Yet, obviously,
policy-holders could not have a good word for men who
abused their positions to fill their own pockets. A very
strong board has been formed in opposition to the com-
panies’ management, of which board Nicholas Longworth
is honorary secretary, and, as he is the son-in-law of
President Roosevelt, it is assumed here that the latter is
in hearty sympathy with the movement.”

Possil ly this co. does an extensive agency business, apart
from the executor and trustee business ; if it doesn’t it is
impossible to account for the heavy' expenses, which
work out at £1 ss. 9d. per cent, per annum of trust
balances, while a pretty' fair average for a moderate-sized
trustee co. in an eastern State is 4s. percent. Agencies
may also account for the remarkable variations in profits.
Otherwise, erratic profits made by trustee cos. don’t look
well; they always suggest that the commission on the
capital value of an estate, running up to 2| per
cent., has been taken credit for before it is
earned, leaving the annual commission to pay- the
expenses of managing the trust; and the danger then is
that, as the annual commission sometimes doesn’t pay
fair expenses, fair expenses are cut down and cheap and
nasty management is substituted. Persons who are
interested in trustee-managed estates or who propose to
hand their own estates over are certainly not interested
in seeing how cheaply the co. can do the business—in
other words, how much it can save out of the manage-
ment of the trusts to pay away in dividends ; and if the
expenses do run to lj per cent, they need not worry
about it. What, however, they have need to see to is
that the office doesn’t pay away so much in dividends and
expenses to-day’, through improperly counting- in corpus
commissions as earned, that it can’t give the best
service tO-morrow. The Bulletin doesn’t know that
these remarks apply to this co ; it is impossible to tell
much from the accounts when a trustee co. also does
general agency business. But, in a general way, the
figures do suggest over again that the law relating to the
most important work of trustee cos. is extremely defec-
tive ; and there is nothing to prevent concerns trading on
the high reputation which some trustee cos. have earned,
and making a serious mess of things—which latter
remark, by the way, certainly doesn’t apply to this
particular co.

This little society found but small demand for its money
. uring the year. Its advances shrank from £5836 to
and the average interest earned was only a frac-
tion over 7 p.c. Fortunately its expenses are very
modest, so a 5 p.c. dividend is just possible. Whether
even that is wise, in the apparent absence of provision
for contingencies, is doubtful. Certainly this can be said
for it—the members are only risking their own money, the
net liability to the public being but £260. And it's a
good deal better to see a society like this go slow than
borrow largely to lend out at low rates on present values.

ture unprofitable. When the first Fremantle smelting
co. was floated in 1897, the mines were acquired, but
they have lain idle ever since, till the advance in lead in-
duced Manager Sutherland to advise the directors to
re-open them.
Boulder Main Reef, Kalgoorlie, has made a
partial clean up, and the result is £2090 from 1997 tons,
or about 21s. per ton. The full return, with costs, will
be published shortly. The remodelled plant is capable of
treating 2500 tons monthly. On June 30 ore reserves
were given as 20,000 tons, worth 345., or eight months’
supply, but a good deal of ore has been opened up since
then, and some of it of higher value. On present infor-
mation, the proposition does not look very promising.
South Kalgurli (W.A.) is not maintaining its
position. On Bept. 30 last- year ore reserves were esti-
mated to be 123,000 tons, worth 395., while, on Sept. 30,
’O6, they had fallen to 112,000 tons, worth 325. During
the 12 months 94,400 tons were treated, and the mill
gained 11,000 tons on development. Profits, which, a
year ago, were over £6OOO a month, are now only half
that amount. Manager Morgan has run the mine care-
fully and economically, but the lode is so patchy that it
is difficult to maintain the reserves. There are still possi-
bilities, as Marty’s, or the Perseverance, lode at 1500 ft. is
14ft. wide, worth 4oz. But that is only according to
diamond-drill bore ; and in most of the higher levels this
lode has been proved to be practically worthless.
Mararoa, Norseman (W.A.), is opening up well
at the 240 ft. level, and it is now certain that the option
will be exercised. Where the reef was pierced, it assayed
60s. for sft. wide, but, in the drives, it has improved to
635. A trial parcel of some 400 tons is going through
the Government mill; should this support consulting-
engineer Henderson’s estimate of 60s. per ton, there will
be no difficulty in paying the purchase price without
rushing calls. Even in the casual way in which the mine
is being worked, 400 tons of ore are being raised monthly,
and the profit from this tonnage would very soon make a
nice nest egg.
* * * *
Princess Royal, Norseman (W.A.), after sus-
pending crushing for six to seven weeks, has re-started
the mill. Active development work has been proceeding
siiice Manager Henderson took charge of the combined
properties, and it looks as if the mine will do better in
the future than it has done recently. Still, some months
must elapse before the full results of the amalgamation
are seen.

Lancefield, Davyhurst (W.A.), is not likely to
join the regular producers for some time to come, The
new treatment plant, modelled after that of the South
Kalgurli, continues to give a lot of trouble. The manage-
ment apparently forgot that the South Kalgurli is dry,
while the Lancefield makes 100,000 gallons per day.
The wet ore, going direct to the Edwards furnaces,
caused a collapse of the brickwork, and the fur-
naces have practically to be rebuilt. Edwards,
the patentee of the furnaces, is looking into the
trouble on the spot. Even if the furnaces were all
right, treatment could not proceed, owing to want of
firewood for the roasting ; and, as timber in the district
is very scarce, this isn’t an item to be cleared up in one
day. A lot of changes have been made in the staff, from
manager downwards, and, of course, everyone is blamed,
though none of them is responsible for the failure to
roast wet ore in a close furnace.
* » « *
Queen Margaret, Bulong (W.A.), has had a
Very chequered career since Henderson gave up the
management. The local control has been very expen-
sive, and now some pretty accusations are being' made
against one another by some of the people who were in-
terested. If chairman Harvey Patterson had any time to
worry about such a tinpot show, things would have been
changed long ago.
« * * *
Golden Pole, Davyhurst (W.A.), now once
again in charge of Nat. Harper, is being shaken up. Late
Manager shut down part of the mill and reduced the out-
put to 1000 tons a month, but Harper has started an extra
five head, and the output will be increased to 1500 tons
monthly. On July 31 ore-reserves were given as 16,300
tons, or 11 months’ supply, so that the necessity for closing
down five head was not very apparent, especially as it
increased costs. Since last balance-sheet co. has earned
profits of £2300, and should do better in future. But the
erratic nature of the reef makes the future of the mine
doubtful.
* * * *
Wages at Broken Hill have been put up rather
more than Is. per shift. The number of men employed may
be taken at 7400; last year they mined and treated 1,339,034
tons of ore, or 25,750 tons per week, which pans out
slightly under 3£ tons per week per man. Allowing for
construction work going on, a weekly average of about
4 tons of ore may be reckoned for every man on the pay-
• sheet; and, on that estimate, an extra shilling per shift
means Is. 6d. per ton added to working- costs. This
wipes out between one-half and one-third of the profit
from zinc-bearing tailings. Still most of the cos. can
well afford the increased wages ; for the extra expense is
equivalent to considerably less than £1 per ton on
their output of lead.
It is probable that the British, Broken Hill,
won’t be long now in arriving with the drill at the
extremely shy shoot of ore at the 800 ft. level. From the
400 ft. of Blackwood’s section a drill-hole is being put
down at an angle, following a branch of ore off the
western leg. It is expected that this may make bigger as
it o-oesdown. The old 490 ft. Junction stope, which was
holed into last week, is yielding high-grade ore ; and this
is a godsend just now. 4 # *
An Adelaide promoter has formed a syndicate
to exploit an alleged mine on the north side of Stephens
Creek reservoir, six miles from Broken Hill. The show
adioins the old Eaglehawk, where, in the early days, rich
bunches of chlorides were produced. The particular
seductiveness about the new show is that carbonate
of iron associated with silver has been discovered ; and
the silver assay was simply dazzling. But, unfortunately,
when an important buyer of ore came up for a second
plateful it wasn’t forthcoming ; so it looks as though
the whole mine, so far as it has been developed, went
into the assay-pot. And it was only a small assay-pot, too.

Alfred Clarke, whose capacious heart, capa-
cious frame, fand capacious modesty have definitely en-
throned himjas the Clarke and Co., has one ambition. It
is to repeat with the New White Leads, Broken Hill, the
history of the South and North B.H. mines. “Alfred”
was sponsor to these two claims in the old days of J.
W. Collins and Captain Morrish. But he lost grip of
them somehow, though he never lost faith. Even
the Victoria, which he cherished carefully, was snatched
from him by the Tyrrel-cwm-Baillieu combination and
added to the North Broken Hill vineyard. So the ewe
lamb left is the New White Leads, away south on
the flat from the Broken Hill outcrop, towards
the Pinnacles. There are three dour Scotchmen
on the Leads board, and it has been a case of
“ mon, be carefu’ o’ the saxpences.” Years of work only
sees 400 ft. of sinking and not much drifting done. A
canny Yorkshireman, one Siddall by name, pleads that
Bull is dying to put £50,000 to the credit of the Leads.
But “ Alfred ” is coy about parting with his last love, for
he isn’t quite a chicken now'. Chairman Thompson
says, “ Well, the board’ll just consider any offer.”
So far, the best the co. can show is a shoot of 19 per cent,
ore of about 4ft. average width, down to 300 ft., where the
shoot was over 300 ft. long. Rising Sun, nearer the South
Blocks, has sft. at 500 ft., and it is Clarke’s hope that
width and value will increase in the Leads with depth.
This is not what happened in the Block 5 old shaft. Still,
there are worse mining gambles than the New' White
Leads, and worse things could happen than that a slice
of luck should hit the middle button of A. E. Clarke’s
hospitable w'aistcoat.
If the Crowl Creek-Shuttleton (N.S.W.) amal-
gamation goes through (and there isn’t much doubt
about it) the new co.—to be called Crowl Creek-Shuttle-
ton—will be in 150,000 shares of £1 each, 120,000 paids
and 30,000 contribs. Of the paids Crowl Creek gets
61,000 and Shuttleton 49,000, and the other 10,000 go as
bonus shares to those shareholders w'ho apply for their
proportion of the contribs. at 7s. per share. Thus 100
present shares in Crowl Creek will carry 58 paids, and on
the holder of 100 shares taking up 14 contribs (at 75.) he
will get four additional paid shares. In Shuttleton 100
present shares will carry 36 paids, and on taking
up 11 contribs. (at 75.) the shareholders will get
three additional shares. Fractions will go to reserve.
The mines have been valued at the same figure ; the dif-
ference in the allotment of paid shares represents the
estimated difference in the value of the two plants. No
distinction is made between present paid and contribut-
ing shares in the scheme, which altogether seems a fair
one. And there isn’t any doubt that amalgamation is
the proper thing. The new co. will have £10,500 sub-
scribed to go on with.

The old Dine Dine tin lodes, 50 miles from
Condoblin and 100 miles from Cobar (N.S.W.), are being
attended to. Many years ago Cobar men worked them,
picking out the rich patches and hand-dressing the
stuff ; but that is no way to handle a property whose
strength lies in its 3 per cent. ore. There are several
veins, all quartz, running up to as much, as 12ft. in
width ; and there is enough stone exposed to justify
putting up a small battery—it doesn’t take many tons
of tin to pay for a battery these times. The proceeds
should be used in searching for the main ore channel,
which apparently hasn’t yet been found.
* ■* * *
From a man at Tingha (N.S.W.) who doesn’t
like portable tin dredges “There have been four floods
on Cope’s Creek, at Tingha, recently, in quick succes-
sion. In the midst of them it was reported that one
portable tin-dredging plant had stopped for want of
water. Yet there was enough to wash engines and all to
kingdom come—that is, until the dam broke. Then they
were able to report no water. They should have said,
‘No tin.’ Portable plant shares are a risky speculation
for one not on the spot. Yet the promoters of these failures
seem to retain their fatness and their winning smiles.”

Even out of Mt. Lyell (Tas.), which does far
more for itself than most Australian concerns, the foreign
workman gets a big bite. Net profit was about £53 per
ton of copper last half-year. The value of the blister
copper shipped, including gold and silver, was about £lO5
per ton (copper averaged £B5 9s. 4d.); so, if we reckon
the net profit at £53, it required about £52 per ton to
cover costs and foreign returning charges. The mining
and smelting costs were £36 per ton of copper, so £l6 is
left to coverall other costs, including foreign returning
charges for separating the gold and silver from the
copper. Freight and some other expenses have to be de-
ducted ; but it seems safe to reckon that about one-fourth
of the total costs, or, say, about £lB, is paid to foreigners.
They not only get the lion’s share of the dividends, but
also get a lot of the work.
An old and much valued friend, the Crown
Lyell (Tas.), has been dragged from seclusion by Thomas
Luxton, who has purchased 65,000 forfeited shares.
These shares are no doubt those over which an option
was given to another broker for a tenner a little while
since. Now they are sold at 6d. each on a deposit of £5OO.
To get that money back, 10,000 shares wouid have to be
placed at Is. each. Judging by the market made, it did
not take long to recover this much, unless the dealing
consisted of cross-firing on a big scale. Those who buy
into the co. must do it for a gamble. The mine,
first and last, has been a duffer, as rank as any
of the outside shows in the Lyell district. Pyrites
were got by sinking, but the average was low. It
is doubtful if 500 tons of 4 per cent, ore could be shown.
Once it was thought that the claim had value because of
its position—next door to the North Lyell. If the North
Lyell shoot is making sensibly towards the Crown Lyell
lease, there might be something to be said in favor of
holding shares. But the Mt. Lyell working plans do not
bear this out any more than does the persistent ignoring
of the claim by the big co. Show consequently, on pre-
sent proved resources, hasn’t anything to justify a market
for its shares. Still, that want is not likely to baffle
Stock Exchange metallurgists trained to concentrating
the nimble ninepence.

Central Cookman’s is a Maldon (Yic.) show
with Bendigo capital behind it, and has such venerable
names as Watson, Dyason, and Thompson Moore as
props. The show is run on true Bendigo lines,
except in one particular. On Bendigo principles,
management, including board fees, costs only
£3OO a year. Directors, instead of making calls
to do progressive work, have been living on a small bank
overdraft and a few dribs of profits got from stone broken
from the intermediate workings ; and that is not like
, Bendigo, though it may be Maldon practice. Co. has got
on to 6ft. of stpne at the 300 ft. level, described as
“payable.” Now, it would not be Maldon stone if
it was not payable, for there is more “payable”
quartz reported at Maldon for less divs. than in any
other square mile in Yic. This 6ft. of stone in the Cook-
man’s may lead to something, but when shares stick at
3s. there does not seem to be another South German in
the air. Better things are looked for from Thompson
Moore than to let a co. live practically on scrapings as
the Cookman has done for six months just past. Let a
few stout calls be made, and no one will grumble, but it
is folly to scramble on in the little way Central Cook-
man’s is now run.

“Burchie” : Here at the new Tarnagulla (Vic.)
rush, where, till a few days ago, even the birds suffered
from melancholia, one can count about 500 men (and two
women). Miners are in the majority. Swaggie comes
next; after him, cocky, who can’t get his crop off for
want of men. The lead runs into private property, and
Private Property asks for ss. to place your pegs in the
ground, and £2 to break the surface. Swaggie—who
hasn’t the coin, as a rule —is barred. Am too excited to
reckon what £2 ss. for a 60ft. claim means per acre ; but
the farmer (the poor farmer !), whose ground is being
ruined (?), has a good thing on. Some men are raking
out gold—but the “ poor farmer ” has the best claim.
“ Mallarapoonie,” from Cloncurry (Q.): The
Bulletin mentioned lately that, one way and another,
Hampden seems to have been bungled a good deal. To
meet the circumstances, remarks of that kind should be
made with vehemence ; and the fact that, up to the pre-
sent, the contributing shareholders have shown no dis-
position to ask irrelevant—not to say distinctly rude
questions, marks them as being, very mild and affable
bipeds. Affability appears to be one of Australia’s great
natural resources. The mine is now put under the super-
vision of a Mr. Smith ; and it is up to Mr. Smith to deal
with the demon Bungle. But, while it is one thing to
play the giddy ox with a big strong thing like the
Hampden, it is quite another to monkey round with a
gross of small squibs, in the way the Willcocks Cloncurry
Co. has done. This is the concern the State put its hand
in its pocket to assist, and it is pretty safe to say that, if
it hadn’t been for the assistance it received, the concern’s
exact location would now be mighty hard to define. It
is one of those things that mostly live on assistance—and
the hopes of further assistance. After the way it has
fooled about, its name is Mud —just plain earth mixed
with water, which two are Slush.
“An offset is Mt. Elliott. It is the exception
that proves the rule of Bungle. Not since the day
that development work began has a false blow with a pick
been struck ; not a spike has been driven but where it
was intended to stay. The equipment is beyond reproach,
the w'orkmanship good, and from start to finish the work
of development has never flagged. And these things have
been done while the railway is yet 200 miles away ; in the
face of a Herculean water problem that will always be a
problem, seeing the mine is within 1 j miles of the crest of
the main dividing range ; and with high rates of carriage,
scarcity of good timber, and 101 other items to contend
w'ith.
“ There are several other small, tired syndicates
hereabouts with an inclination to lean up against the
globe and rest awhile. An exception is Bedford’s West
Cloncurry ’Cate. At time of writing, however, this con-
cern seems to have accidentally got its leg over the back
of its neck, or something like that. It hopes to eventu-
ally untie itself, but if it fails there is nothing, for it but
to die in a knot. And that’s a horribly uncomfortable
position to be buried in.”
The crowd behind Mt. Elliott ought to be
making money. A few' months ago, with the market at
about 405., the co. issued a big block of shares at 305., more
than half of them going to certain underwriters—as
though any underwriting were necessary under such
circumstances. Then, as if to scare the shareholders from
applying, the market was squeezed down to about 28s.
Recently Melbourne sharebroker Keats was sent to Eng-
land to “introduce” Elliotts, and do a little in the in-
terests of Chillagoe and the Leichhardt syndicate ; and
with a report from Waller to back him up—addressed to
and apparently paid forby the directors —Elliottshave been
boosted to 87s. Though the mine, as far as it has been
proved, is extra good, the stock is pretty obviously one
that the outsider is liable to burn his fingers over.
* * * !._■*
The dear old S.M. Herald is a rare humorist
when it mentions a mine. Monday it mentioned that
during Saturday Elliotts had jumped some more. “ Pos-
sibly,” says the ancient joker, “this may have been
assisted by the announcement in Saturday’s Herald that
the finances of the co. have been so nursed that its credit
balance and liquid assets aggregate £40,000, and the co.
is therefore in an excellent position to develop its large
reserves of low-grade ore down to the 370 ft. level.” The
poor old thing forgot chat its paragraph on Saturday
wasn’t about Elliott at all, but about Mt. Molloy, and
that Elliott hasn’t any 370ft.' level to get low-grade or
any other sort of ore from. If the Herald nowadays
reports on Monday that Jones is ill, and on Tuesday that
Smith is dead, it is apt to remark that Smith’s dead-
ness did not come as a surprise owing to the forethought
of the Herald in announcing, Jones’s illness the previous
day.

Gilmore tin show (N.Q.) has some phenomenally
rich ore in its shafts. Lode is a soft kaolin, containing
much oxide that could be washed out, with lumps of
harder ore thrcugh it. Dolly Grey shaft is down 100 ft. ;
sinking has been stopped until a whip is erected, although
a level has been started from the bottom. There have
been good rains in the district, which will interfere with
packing, especially as the stuff, when wet, is like soup.
Midas shaft is down 35ft. From these two shafts all tho
ore so far crushed has been raised. The shafts are
supposed to be on the same line of lode ; if they are it is a
big, rich mine. The country is a shale, with a quartzite
dyke running through it. Understood that Waller, John
Moffat’s technical adviser, has a good opinion of. the
probable persistency of the lode. Anyway, the claim has
put up a record for a tin min 6 by paying dividends out of
the stuff taken out in shaft-sinking. It is, in fact,
doubtful whether any other mine in Queensland has
done it except the Victory, at Charters Towers.

Rather than waste their time upon a proposal for
a tin smelter in North Queensland, the YVaverley Associa-
tion might, with advantage, look into the question of a
plant for dealing with impure copper ores. North
Queensland abounds in this class of material, and the
Waverley people would find' no. difficulty in assuring
themselves of a tonnage easily; which is the first point to
be considered in the erection of a smelting plant.
Briefly, the points are—(l) What have you got to treat?
(21 How will vou treat it? (3) Where will you treat it?

Those who are supposed to know what is
coming expect Mt. Cannindah to be the next Queensland
copper shares to have a demand. Philp, jun., has taken
charge, and is more than satisfied with recent develop-
ments. (Old disastrous politician Philp, sen., to whom
Mt. Morgan and other Queensland mining ventures were
not kind, is a big holder, and also of Elliotts, so his luck
seems to have turned.) The worst feature of Cannindah
is its 300,000 shares ; but most of this big swag are well
held.

“T.R.S.C.” : W. A. Thompson, mentioned in
B. 15/11/’O6, has proved that in the Northern Territory
white labor is the cheap labor. Zapopan, with yellow
men, can’t pay on oz. stuff; Thompson: has pulled
through on Bdwt. Yet Zapopan, with a reef of easily-got
stone, and with winding engine and facilities for
economical handling and treatment, has for manager a
good miner, good battery man, good engineer, and good
fellow, who would make a name for himself in any other
part of Australia ; but loaded down with Chinese labor
in the N.T. he fails. Thompson, on the other hand, with
about the same size of reef as the Zapopan, though much
harder to break, and working under the most primitive
conditions, hauling with a whip and carting half a mile to
the five-head battery, shows a profit from hit North Star
stone, averaging barely Bdwt. The difference lies partly
in Thompson, but mostly in the white miners he employs
whenever he can capture them ; and he never employs a
Chow in the mill. Do you hear? No Chows in the
battery.

M.L. Mines Department has appointed as its
Inspecting Engineer Frank Reed, who, from being a
mines inspector in VVestralia, stepped into the general

of the prospectors and owners of the New Cardiff colliery,
now the Seddonville State coal mine.

The Maoriland State Mines Record has been
reprinting John McCombi'e’s story of how he and Robert
Lee found the Waihi. They had been working on Wai-
tekauri with poor success, and had gone further afield,
when they came on the Waihi quartz outcrop. But as
soon as they started tunnelling the Maoris began to
bother them, on the plea that the place was a wahi tapu.
Once the natives tried to close in the end of the tunnel
and bury them alive, but were scared off by a well-timed
explosion. Finally they could do nothing else but work
at night till they got out two tons of stuff. Upon this
the Thames County Council—more Socialism ! —paid the
freight to O>vharoa, where it gave loz. 3dwt., worth
about £2 17s. 6d. per oz. McCombie and Lee, having had
the stuff assayed, decided that the battery had only got
out about a third of the metal; but (this was in 1878)
they were assured that assays were “ fads ”; and the
“ practical mining experts ” thereabouts hit the show' with
the largest curses they possessed. Result was the pros-
pectors couldn’t raise any money, and were starved out.
While they were away trying to earn something, other
parties came along, pegged on the reef, and finally, to
save a fight for which they hadn’t the stomach left,
McCombie and Lee formally abandoned the ground.
After a spell of very profitable but wasteful work the
claims got into trouble again, and the present Waihi Co.
was only formed with difficulty. It has now 330 stamps
at work, and the divs. from the mine up to the end of
the co.’s last year amounted to £1,924,018. McCombie,
one of the prospectors, is at present manager of the
Talisman, at Karangahake; Lee, who was an American
miner, faded out years ago.
“Pea-green”: Resolved at the conference of
representatives of Stock Exchanges in Melbourne, “That
no official quototion shall be granted by the Stock Ex-
changes of Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney for vendors’
shares in mining companies until at least six months
after the registration of the company on their official
lists.” How virtuous ! And one of the gentlemen who
carried this was the underwriter of the shares in a recent
S. Aus. copper “go,” in which a market was made for the
underwritten eighteen-penny stock at prices running up
to 6s. before a£lo nqte had been spent on the “mine.”
There were also “ various suggestions concerning alteia-
tions in the No Liability Acts” ; but the public didn’t
get any details of them. The brokers assembled did not
suggest the desirability of stringent alterations in. ttie
Liquidation of Companies Act. Liquidation nowadays
often means robbery. Not one-third of the liquidating
mining cos. ever see balance-sheets or statements of the
liquidation, and inquiries regarding them are met either
by insolent replies or by frigid surprise at the inquiring
creditor’s impertinence.

One of the special points to be considered by
the Broken Hill British Mine in the extension of their
present mill, was a suitable rockbreaker. There are
several types of crushers at the Hill, but the management
of the British decided to purchase Austin Rotary Rock-
breakers after exhaustive enquiry and practical work
with other makes. The Block 10 Co. purchased two
Austin’s some time ago, and these were put to a very
severe test for capacity, horsepower, and wearing abili I y
—the result has been a triumphant and conclusive proof
that the Austin is the best machine at present offering,
crushing more material with less h.p. than other makes.
They have forced lubrication, double counter shaft
bearings, and are of heavy construction to withstand all
strain. W. and J. Lempriere, of Melbourne, are the sole
agents.*

The introduction into the Broken Hill and
Western Australian Mines of a small hand rock-drill for
boring “ pops ” to break up large blocks of ore, cutting
“ hitches” for timber, and squaring up shafts and levels,
has quite revolutionised the old method of working with
hammers and gad. The best machine for this work is the
“ Shaw ” Hand Rock Drill and is manufactured by the
Austral Otis Engineering Company, Ltd., Melbourne,
who are the sole agents. The machine weighs only 161bs.
and has only one working part—the hammer—-which
serves the purpose also of a valve. One man with this
machine can easily do as much work as four men with
hammer and drill. In some of the hardest lodes in the
Boulder these machines bore over lin. a minute, and in
softer country as much as 2£in. per minute. Unlike other
types, the operator does not experience any excessive
vibration due to the recoil of the hammer. The working
pressure is 801bs. per square inch and the machine uses
about 25 cubic feet of free air per minute. Ten of the
biggest mines in West Australia are now using the Shaw
Hand Rock drills. Fullest particulars may be obtained
from the Company’s offices in South Melbourne, where
the machine may be seen working.* M

The strength, lightness, durability and low cost
of spiral rivited pipe have given it a place of superiority
above any other pipe. This pipe possesses enormous
bursting strength, and is protected, inside and out, with a
perfect coating manufactured from asphalt. Asphalt
coaled steel pipes have lasted from 25 to 40 years without
any sign of decay, and may last as long again. Spiral
pipe is manufactured by Mephan Ferguson, at Wanganui,
New Zealand, and at his engineering and pipe works,
Melbourne, where the latest up-to-date machinery is also
used for making boilers, fluming, ref rigerators, bolts, nuts,
and every discrintion of cast or wrought iron work.*

manufacturers of the “Hornsby” Patent Safety Oil
Engine, the latest adaption of which is their Traction
Engine, have entered the Gas Engine arena and are now
making the Hornsby-Stockport Gas Engine and Suction
Gas Plant. The latter we learn will develop upwards of
10 brake horse power at the cost of Id. per hour. The
minimum cost and attention required should prove a great
inducement to users of motive power to instal this type
of plant. The Australasian addresses of the above firm

The Reavell Air Compressor is an entirely new
departure in compressor design, and by its numerous
good points is already finding considerable favor in Au -
tralian mining circles. As there are no section valves,
the volumetric efficiency is at least 5 per cent higher than
any other compressor. It is unrivalled for driving by
means of an electric motor, and is the only machine in
which driving gears can be altogether dispensed with.
The sole licensees for Australia"are Babcock and Wilcox,
makers of the well-known water tube boiler, whose Aus-
tralasian office is at the Haymarket, Sydney.*

“Moon”: The .recent death of King
Micky, of the Illawarra (N. S. W.) tribe —he
passed away at his palatial gum-tree beside
Minnimurra River—recalls an occasion on which
he interested me much. Was at a South Coast
show, and saw Micky start a business of the
Aunt Sally variety. The plant consisted of a
small, narrow shield, a cricket ball, and a vacancy
of twenty paces between him and the enemy.
The public was earnestly entreated to attempt
regicide at a penny per attempt. The spec,
proved a sound one, and the way that skipping
emperor dodged the flying ball made me feel
proud that I was. an Australian. Skilful shield
work kept him all in one piece for an hour or two,
but his rapidly-increasing affluence got him down.
Adjournments to a hidden bottle of rum became
frequent. Then it grew more and more evident
that Micky saw several balls flying at him at
once, and his inability to decide which one to
spar-up at resulted in the forcible removal of one
of the royal toe-nails. The astonishing antics of
that child of nature led me to imagine that he
was hurt, but later reading in “ Aboriginalities ”
about niggers who burnt off their feet for amuse-
ment or sat down on the red embers as a matter
of preference have convinced me that his wild and
frequent throwing of himself into the air and his
frenzied bellowing were mere s'gns of joy.
Anyhow, he scratched himself for all events for a
week, and when 1 asked a retainer next day
about the imperial health, I was told “Micky
blay no more plurry cricket.”
“Mallarapoonie,” from some way north :
“E.H.W.” (B. 18/10/’O6) writes of the imperviousness
of blowflies to heat; which reminds ire that up in Car-
pentaria (the region that drains—or rather boils—into
the Gulf) there is a beetle that can knock “E.H.W.’s”
flies into a cocked reverberatory furnace. Am not aware
what its correct beetleological name is, but locally it is
called the asbestos beetle, or devil fly. This heat-beetle
is a big brother-in-law to the entertaining “crick-back,”
and its capacity for standing heat is positively astound-
ing. On the sultriest summer days it may be seen
shivering on galvanised iron roofs with an overcoat on.
If an open fire is handy it will assuredly be found tramp-
ing round among the half-dead embers and ashes. It will
inhabit a permanent fireplace, and never appears happy
unless allowed to sit on the iron pot-hangers just where
the smoke leaps from the blaze. At night it burrows
among the hot charcoal and ashes to camp. Have known
an asbestos beetle accidentally drop into the boiling
beef bucket, and only succumb after thrashing round
for a space like a rudderless motor-boat. Personally, it
is an active, sour-tempered insect, with an aggressive
buzz, and a bite like the prod of a devil. In color it is
jet black. It escaped from Tophet originally, and still
hankers after the old familiar environments.

Just when scientific people are telling us
that the Australian aborigine is not such a low-
down specimen of humanity after all, we awake
to find that the jocund samples of native nobilitv
who used to haunt Sydney streets in days when
we could not appreciate them, are vanished. Ten
years ago there were a good number of aboriginal
monarchs and peers about the N.S.W. capital,
but they, and their glory., and their dilapidated
toppers, faded by. degrees. The blackfellow’s
topper was the emblem of his sovereignty, or his
dukedom. It was his coronet, his ancestral man-
sion, his seat in the House of Lords, and the sign
and seal of his pomp, dignity, and pedigree.
With it, he overawed the mere aboriginal herd,
and maslied the aboriginal beauty. He took it
off when he received 3d. for beer, and he put it
on again while he drank the beer. He also slept
in it, if appearances were any criterion ; and its
frayed look likewise suggested that he used it as a
trap for porcupines. And now, just when we
learn that King Billy was rather a fine character
after all, and had begun to think of adding Billy-
study to the school curriculum, we find that Bill
and his hat are gone.

“ Onk ” : Has any Bulletiner anything to
say about the tuneful note of the stumpy-tailed,
blue-tongued lizard ? Towards evening Mr. S.
Tail makes a noise something like “Hoo-hoo, ”
repeated several times, with intervals of about
half-a-second between each “hoo.” I have fol-
lowed the sound on more than one occasion, and
always found the reptile. I’ve come to the con-
clusion that he’s making an appointment with the
future Mrs. S. Tail.

“ C.E.E.” : In answer to “ Janor ” and
others re snake killing. The very best way to treat
these reptiles is with silent contempt or Christian
fortitude. Don’t, under any circumstances, leave
your bed on account of a snake—to leave a
warm bed in a fevered condition for the purpose
of jumping on any reptile is positively dangerous,
and to chase the beast out on to the cultivation
paddock and stone it in the night air when
you have hardly anything on save a cold
shudder is madness. Also, one method is
just as futile as another. Ignore your snake
—with practice you can ignore two snakes
at once. If the snake wants to sit on the
edge of the bed let it sit there till it is tired.
It is a long snake that has no turning, and
in the end it will turn away. A cold attitude
for a cold snake is part of the fitness of things.

“Spotter”: In some of the townships
along the Great Southern Railway (W.A.) may be
seen at times, on the razzle, objects dressed like
men. They stare on the ground with a terrible
fixed stare, and go to and fro as if searching for
lost treasure. These are “ poison punchers.” They
chiefly inhabit the south-eastern portion of the
State, where they obtain a livelihood grubbing
poison plant on the large estates. The pay is £1
a week and rations of £lb. tea, 2 sugar, 10 flour,
7 tins dog, and 2 rice. Gangs of these staring
inhabitants, with a ganger at 255. per week and
above ration allowance, work together. Each
man is supposed to cook for himself, find tent,
&c., and carry water and crib to work. The work
consists of walking up and down large paddocks,
each man taking a strip about a quarter of a
chain wide. Followed or driven or howled at by
the ganger, up to 12 or 15 miles a day may be
traversed. The staring person carries a bag to
hold the grubbed poison plant. When the bag is
full its contents are dislodged and burnt. The
wages and ration allowance together are worth
265. 6d. per week of six days. I fancy these indi-
viduals become professors of mesmerism in their
old age. They have the glassy eye of the cheap
mesmerist, and the fixed expression that is cal-
culated to overcome the cheap “subject” and
make him eat candles.

JONES: “ What became of that old dog of yours, Pat? ”
PAT : "Share, he shwallered a tape measure , an ’ it kilt him.”
JONES : "He died by niches, thin.”
PAT : " Indade he didn’t. He wint round and died by the yard.”
What, damme, is the country coming
to ! At Waikato (M.L.) the local Fatmen chased
a smell over a sheep-farmer’s ground, and per-
suaded themselves that it was a real old Hinglish
fox, and that they were Hinglish Squires. When
he’d done cussing them, the farmer charged the
red-coated persons with frightening his ewes, and
exhibited many prematurely born lambs as an
evidence of damage. The Bench had the deplor-
able taste to charge Fat for the dead lambs, the
burst fences, and the damaged ewes. Some
Benches don’t seem to know the respect due to
Fat, especially when it is Fat masquerading as
Squire.

“The Prooshan ” : Notwithstanding our
echidna’s accredited weakness for ants as an
article of diet, I never yet succeeded in getting
one to eat an ant while under my eye. I placed
a large “ porky” on a nest of meat ants once, but
his quillship got away quick and lively without
sampling one, and started disappearing beneath
my eyes in his own mysterious fashion, without
slinging any tailings, some yards from the nest.
In spite of this, I have found the same nests
or mounds tunnelled through and through by
echidnas in winter time, when the ants are boxed
up.
“ Agricola ” : It’s a fat lot of good going
to the expense of providing a mob of legislators
to draw up magnificent Birds’ Protection Acts,
and to impose fabulous fines in order to enforce
them. As soon as they have got everything
nicely fixed up, some imported idiot sends ’Ome
for an assortment of pests, with which he renders
the expensive Act of no value. There is much
outcry, at times, that, though the lyre bird is
strictly protected, there are plenty of tails in the
market. Of course, the usual idea is that mis-
creants are destroying these beautiful and fast-
disappearing birds for the sake of the few pence
they can obtain for their plumes. This is doubt-
less true in some cases, but, in my locality, there
is no need to rise at an ungodly hour and stalk
the wary biped in his own haunts. If you want
plumes, all you need to do is to walk along the
gullies and collect them, after the fox has done
with them. He has no further use for them after
he has consumed the bird to which they were
attached. There is nothing aesthetic about the
fox, and there is no decorative scheme connected
with his den. During this season alone I esti-
mate that foxes have destroyed more lyre birds in
my district than have been disposed of by men
during the last 10 years. Of course, the im-
ported man says it is the fault of the lyre birds
for roosting low. That’s all right, but they did
it in safety for ages until our imported friends
dragged the fox hither, and, apparently, that
smellful beast is not going to give them much
time to learn safer habits.

“ Hassan ” : I had always doubted that
yarn of the bird which feigns a broken wing to
draw an enemy from its nest. I thought it a
pretty fable for the burnished Sunday-school
infant. I have changed my opinion. Tramping
through the scrub of the sea coast the other day,
I saw my dog put up a small, grey-white bird,
very distinctively marked by a black band round
the neck. It fluttered painfully along the sandy
track, but just managed to keep out of Towser’s
reach. When it had led that excited hound for
50yds. or so, it flew to the top of a stunted banksia,
and poked borak at him. I remembered the
legend, and searched the bush from which it had
come. Sure enough there was the nest with three
absurd young ones. One could see into their
stomachs, so frantic was their yellow-beaked
appeal to the world in general for food. I spoke
of this bird to a small boy of my acquaintance.
He informed me that it was the “ horse-shoe,”
and always played that trick of disablement.
Then he asked me where the nest was, but small
birds are no enemies of mine, and I gave ;the
wrong address. If that small boy is going to the
address I gave him, he has 10 miles to cover,
mostly uphill.

“Knuckle”: Be largest death adder
[B. 15/11/’O6). There was for many years ex-

lid not run the rule over it myself, but it cer-
;ainly looked guilty of the charge.
A FALL IN ORIENTALS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Feroz Khan, the oont-conductor, though well-skilled in
wily arts,
Had the haughty disposition that an eagle nose imparts,
And his fiercely-curling whiskers told the folks along the
road
That Feroz Khan was loaded and was likely to explode.
Feroz looked upon the white man with a proud and
scornful eye,
And regretted to his comrades, with a melancholy sigh,
That the furnaces of Eblis were not vast enough to burn
All the white-faced sons of Shaitan that were waiting for
their turn.
But the pride of man is fated —as it always is, they say—
To come tumbling down in fragments in the good old
moral way;
Thus Feroz, the camel-driver, looked upon his Waterloo,
In the person of McDougal, overseer of Wingaroo.
Now, the ways of hump-backed camels are as Sheol in the
sight
Of a self-respecting equine, and he sweats in dreadful
fright
When he comes in sighting distance of the oont-train and
its packs
Promenading, slow and smellful, out along the western
tracks.
But the haughty soul of Feroz scorned to give the right-
of-way.
“ Let the unbeliever turn off,” he’d sarcastically say ;
And he’d frown in grave reproval when the man of un-
belief
Cursed him roundly—bones and body—for a camel-
driving thief.
Jolting over washed-out wheel-ruts, round the lignum,
dried and dead,
Came the buck-board of McDougal, as his weary way he
sped ;
For the heat was simply awful, and the dust and flies
were worse,
And McDougal lumped them, jointly, in an all-embracing
curse.
From the point where the brown highway winds behind
Terowie shed
Came a jingle and a clatter from the dried-up river-bed,
And the horses’ eyes were roving in a wild, excited quest
O’er the camel-train of Feroz crossing over from the
West.
Nearer drew the swaying camels, wilder grew McDougal’s
team,
Where the grey and dusty highway skirted what was
once a stream.
Till the horses turned and bolted as the swingle-bars
went crash,
And the rest was dust and splinters and profanity and
smash.
Grim and ireful was McDougal as he walked to
Wingaroo,
And he vowed a Scot’s vendetta on that dusky, Afghan
crew,
While he mused, with brow deep-furrowed, on the out-
line of a plan
Which would tend to the undoing of the swarthy Feroz
Khan.
With the laughing kookaburra and the screaming
cockatoo
Came the shades of night a-falling—falling over Win-
garoo,
And the faintly-muttered “hooshtas” and the sound of
muffled grunts
'Signified that here was camping Feroz Khan and all his
oonts.
CHURCH AND COW.
If the dairyman could not come to the church, the
church must go to the dairyman.— Melbourne clergyman.
CURATE (appropriately): “ Dearly beloved
brethren, the Scripture moveth us into
sundry places,” Ac., dec.
When the pall of night grew deeper, and the camp in
slumber lay,
And the cool night-breeze, in passing, made the river-
timber sway,
Swift from out the sombre shadows, where the lignum
thickest grew,
Stole the form of Jock McDougal, overseer at Wingaroo.
Silent-footed, crept McDougal down along the river
track,|
Where the desert-ships lay resting from the labors of the
pack,
And he daubed each patient camel, in the fashion sheep
are tarred,
With a whitewash-brush anointed with an unclean
porker’s lard.
And the bull, the pride of Feroz, was defiled for evermore,
By the malice of McDougal and the burden that he bore
From his neck there hung, suspended by a stout and
heavy line,
Aye, the thrice-accurs&d carcase of a fresh-killed baby
swine.
When the early dawn was breaking on the sky-line, faint
and wan,
Came the sounds of lamentation from the camp of Feroz
Khan,
And for Oriental curses of a special fancy brand
One could quote supplies excessive to a very slight
demand.
Jack McDougal bought the camels, for a song, in Tilpa
pound.
For no trace of haughty Feroz or his minions could be
found,
But in Afghan upper circles ’tis considered infra dig.
To allude, however slightly, to the baleful name of pig.

RELIGION AND CREAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If the dairyman could not come to the church, the
church must go to the dairyman. . . Churches must not
be far from creameries.— Archdeacon Hindlky, at the
Anglican Congress.
Now you’ve nought to mutter at—
Farmers, bring your butterfat!
And your hymn-books pious !
While you shove the old milk-tin
You can hear of Benjamin,
Lot and Ananias.
As the fluid you deliver
Sing ye “ Gather at the River ”
(No unkind reflection);
While you push the day’s affairs
Hear the Collect, chant the prayers,
Swell the glad collection.
It was all a lie prodigious
That the cow was irreligious,
And the calf abhorrent;
Now we know that men of cream
May pursue as well the Gleam
As the milky torrent—
That the Milky Way is given
As a clear short-cut to heaven ;
That from their Creator
Cream-producers are not driven—
But the good from ill is riven
By the separator.

“ S. Remo”: Am one with “Janor
(B 24/10/’O6) re the horse power of the goanna.
We had hunting with us one day an obstinate,
pig-headed boy named Kelly, though he would
have been quite as pig-headed if he had been
called anything else. We struck a “go” of ton-
nage that looked like 6ft. over all, fast as lightning
and trained to the hour. It was in bare, open
country. Kelly was toiling in the rear, when the
go. doubled back, outflanked us, and charged
straight at a blue gum. Kelly noosed him neatly,
but the go. was sft. up the tree before he got his
line taut. Then up he went, drawn by that
reptilian elevator. Before we reached the tree
butt Kelly was out of reach, kicking and clawing
with his feet, but clinging as grimly to that line
as ever Reid clung to office. We yelled to him to
let go and drop, but he wouldn’t or couldn’t.
Then we tied all our lassoes together and tossed
him a line with the help of a stone. If we hadn t
done that Kelly’s skeleton would be up the tree
to this day.

“8.H.D.”: Be “San Remo” (B. 25/10/’O6)
on snake killing. If “San” tries the plan of
always keeping in front of his snake, under the
impression that the scaly horror can only Strike
backwards, he’ll get bitten one of these days.
I won’t dispute that the snake uses his tail to
spring off of, but he can spring just as
well forwards or sideways as he can back-
wards. Was recently walking through the
bush, and perceived a snake alongside me.
Ho reared half his length up on his beam
end, and sprang at me. He nearly scared
breakfast and dinner out of me, but I sprang also,
and he missed. It was my turn now, so I
deliberately broke his back with a stick in the
good, old, safe, conservative way, instead of using
my feet, as “ S. R.” suggests.
“ Harry ” says : I told that bush direction
story way back in “ While the Billy Boils ” days,
and have seen it mangled up in various forms
lately. Here is the original. I think : Scene near
Lowe’s Peak, between Mudgee and Gulgong,
during and after the great rush. Pat O'Some-
thing, settler, cattle-duffer, &c., &c., meets hope-
less new-chum wanting to find his way through to
Gulgong, or anywhere. Pat (impressively) :
“Folley the lay o’ the land till ye git down
forninst Foley’s corner fince. Tur-r-n to the
right, by the dam, and take the Pake on ye’re
left shoulder. Carry it there till ye lift the Gap.
Shift the Pake Onto ye’re back, and carry it there
till ye see the three bowldhers by the Chinaman's
Creek. Cross the creek by the graves ye’ll see
wid the bit of fencin’ round thim. Thin, drop the
Pake, and take the Granite Ridge on ye’re left

“A.S.”: A friend rears poultry. Next
to his place of business there is a Jap. laundry.
Had some chicks there. One day he picked up
two of them in the yard with necks broken. Next
day same. Third day watched. Saw the Jap.’s
fox terrier commit the murder. Called over the
fence to a Jap. who was cutting wood : “I say,
John, your dog been killem my fowl.” No reply.
Remark repeated, and this time provoked a very
emphatic “W’at” from the Jap. “ Your dog
been killem my fowl,” repeated my friend for the
third time. The Jap. gazed at him for a full
minute, and then said, “ Excuse-a me, mister, Pm
not a d—d Chinaman.” By the time my friend
had recovered himself the Jap. had finished chop-
ping the load of wood and had carried it inside.

“ Quiddam ” : Be the prickly pear : During
the last big drought in Queensland most of the
dairies round Rockhampton were kept going by
means of prickly pear, the succulent vegetable
being carted from far and wide to the cow farms,
and then boiled or steamed, cut up, and mixed
with bran, See., and fed to the hungry stock. It
wasn’t good tucker, and meant a lot of labor and
blasphemy, but it filled up and kept the stock
alive. Incidentally the leaves used to fall off the
drays, get covered with dust, and unobtrusively
wait till a cyclist happened along and struck
them, after which the bikist would dismount and
sit under a tree for half a day or so, repairing
about 200 punctures in the outer circumference of
his whirling steed. I know of nothing more pic-
turesque than the language of a cyclist after he
hashit'a 1 meek and lowly pear-leaf.
Pelorus Jack, the white fish of the French
Pass, Maoriland, has at last been recognised. He
is a cetacean of the dolphin family, and his
scientific monniker is Grampus Griseus , other-
wise known as “Risso’s dolphin.” For years
his species was a mystery, and various people
who knew nothing about the creature described
him as a “Silver Whale,” a “Monster White
Shark,” and a “Leper Porpoise.” He is about
14ft. long, has a blunt nose, a humped forehead,
a high dorsal fin, and a narrow fluke tail. He is
mostly bluish white, tinged with purple and
yellow, and his flippers are blackish and mottled
with grey. The whole of his body is covered
with irregular, brown-edged, scratch-like lines in
all directions; these are supposed to have been
caused by the fish scratching himself against the
keels of passing steamers. Logic can do anything,
and this is how it is worked out. The lines
showed that Jack scrubbed himself against the
bottoms of the steamers he piloted—therefore
that was why he piloted them. He scratched
himself because he had an irritation of the skin,
and if he had a very bad irritation he must be a
diseased fish. In the Bible a man who became a
leper was described as going white, therefore this
fish, which had a diseased skin and which was
white, must be a leper—which was all as plain as
mud. As a matter of fact, Jack is apparently in
the best of health; certainly he is wondrously
active, which a leper fish would not be. Far back
in 1848 a school of dolphins came to Pelorus
Sound, but the rest either died off or went back to
the Antarctic —which is the home of the species,
and where it is comparatively common —leaving
Jack on his lonesome. The same creature is
found in Arctic waters, where it is called by
sailors the cow fish. Jack follows all steamers
that go through the Pass with one exception, and
that is the. IT.S.S.Co.’s Penguin. While giving
an exhibition of fancy diving in front of that
steamer he was struck by the forefoot, and rolled
ignominiously. He sheered off, and has ever
since declined to take the slightest notice of the
Penguin, and that fact makes the steamer un-
popular. It is about 30 years since Jack first
commenced to follow craft through the Pass, and
during that time many attempts have been made
to hoist him by hook and line, and riflemen nave
tried to shoot him. But the sailors took him
under their protection, and passengers who tried
to catch him were warned that success might
lead to an unpleasant encounter with the crew,
so they desisted. Since September, 1904, Jack
has been protected by an Order in Council which
makes anyone taking him liable to a fine of £lOO.
This identification is official, and will stand till
the next one comes along. There seem to be holes
in it somewhere. Why did Jack remain when
his companions went away ? Was he an absconder
with the trust funds, or what ? Or was he the
victim of a crusade against the undue use of
cuttlefish (on which he lives) by some finny
Judkins? If he is a dolphin, then he is related
to the blaekfish which are so numerous in those
waters, and it seems more than likely that he is
really only a blaekfish who discovered some
patent food which had the effect of making him
bigger and turning him white. Then perhaps
the rest of the family put it to him gently that it
was time he left, as there was something uncanny
about him, and he left accordingly.

There was a domestic disturbance at
Scanlan’s. Mrs. Scanlan’s shrill voice could be
heard, raised in wrath and scathing vituperation,
and Scanlan, in retort, roared scraps of Irish
minstrelsy, as he was wont to do when drunk
and disorderly. Half the people of the township
were gazing over the fence or peering through
the palings, keenly enjoying the difference in
the family of Scanlan. Mrs. Mick was armed
with a prop-stick, and when she was weary of
advertising her husband’s manifold sins and
wickednesses she swiped at him with her weapon ;
but Scanlan danced over the cabbage plants, and
laughed and sang in crapulous Irish glee. Dis-
gusted at her inability to impress her bad man,
Mrs. S. turned to the crowd for sympathy, and,
with tears streaming down her cheeks, she wailed :
“Look ut him ! Will yer look ut him? A fort-
night Chewsda th’ docthor guv him up fer hope-
less, ’n’ like th’ thrue wife I am I prepared meself
fer th’ wor-rst, ’n’ what d’ye think he’s done on
me? Bad cess t’ him if the bla’guard haven’t
dhrunk th’ good whisky I got in fer his wake ! ”
AN EASY ONE.
SALT (haring finished his talc of the sea-serpent): “ I s’pose you boys find it hard to believe me?”
AMIABLE YOUTH: “ Not at all! Not at all! I’ve believed bigger lies than that."

Viviani, the new French Minister of
Labor and Health, “proposes to administer his
department as a Socialist, and to extend trades-
unionism ” ; and “he intends to demand a 10-
hours working-day.” There seems room here for
some explanation from Tom Mann and the other
gentlemen who talk to Australian workmen about
a six-hour and a four-hour day, and yet won’t
hear of such a thing as Protection. How, with
Freetrade, does Thomas propose that the goods
made in a factory where men work four hours
daily shall compete, in point of cheapness, with
those from the factory where men work 10 hours
for no greater wages ?
The reason assigned by N.S.W. Premier
Carruthers for abandoning his principal measures
and closing the session with a bang is remark-
able :—
I recognise that the Opposition has used me very fairly,
and I do not want to make return by using the majority
which I have to try to force something down their throats
when there is no time for discussion.
Plenty of Premiers have declared that they had
to abandon their measures because of the obstruc-
tiveness of the Opposition, but Joe is the first one
to throw his Bills overboard because the Opposi-
tion gave him every facility to carry them. That
was actually the best excuse Joe could find for
not trying to carry the famous measure for the
reform of the Lands Department, about which he
blew so big a trumpet.
What Christmas Gift would a woman value
now more highly than that of a beautiful complexion ?
And yet with the heat of our Australian Christmas how
niggard is nature of this gift. But do not despair. The
Valaze Massage Institutes at 158 Pitt-street, Sydney, and
274 Collins-street, Melbourne, places this almost
priceless gift within the reach of the fair sex of
the sister capitals. It is wonderful how young
and fresh and radiant one’s complexion becomes
under the beauty treatment as practised there.
Wrinkles and crowsfeet seem to be just spirited away and
a woman rises from the massage chair radiant as a rose.
But not only is ordinary face massage in all its exquisite
phases practised there but serious blemishes such as birth-
marks, moles, red noses, disfiguring growths, double
chins, etc., are painlessly and permanently removed. For
use in the home toilet, Mile. Rubinstein, the principal of
the allied Valaze Institutes, has a number of European
preparations that have won renown in beauty circles of
the Continent. Of Valaze itself, that dainty Russian
Skin Food, praise is superfluous. It is the one beauty
belief of thousands of Australian women. But there are
others. Rusmo Hair Killer, a liquid for removing super-
fluous hairs ; Valaze Blackhead and Open Pore Cure ;
Valaze Herbal Soap and Valaze Skin Lotion are a trio of
beauty builders that, are sovereign in their respective
spheres. They are sold by all chemists throughout Aus-
tralia and New Zealand, but if you have any difficulty in
securing them you should write direct to Mile. Helena

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, December 4, 1906.
My Dear Arini.
Captain D’Oyley, of the Pegasus, might have
quoted, when his warship’s propeller struck a
rock in Farm Cove, “how Nature is always on
the watch to trip us up when we strut.” He had
just started the Bullward voyage. A swarm of
friends had bidden him adieu (he was the most
popular man of his kind in the shore set), and
were lined up on the shore or in launches, waving
hands and handkerchiefs. The Flagship’s yards
were manned and its band playing as the Pegasus
did a fancy steaming exit. The flushed and
flattered captain, who is noted for his elegant,
hair-trigger kind of manceu vring, was on the
bridge, a proud Briton, when the kittenastrophe
occurred. It couldn’t be classed as a catastrophe—
only a couple of blades broken. But it was
enough to suddenly make cold tea of the cham-
pagne send-off and put the Peggy into dock.
Miss Eugenie Duggan (Mrs. Anderson) and
state Premier Carruthers had an interchange of
compliments behind the curtain on Saturday
night, after the formal opening of Wonderland
City. “lam pleased to meet a great man,” said
the tragedienne, when Carruthers was introduced.
“It can be no unusual occurrence for you,
madame ; you meet one every day in your hus-
band.” Which was extremely “ready” of the
State Premier. That gentleman, by the way, is
being congratulated on the arrival, last week of a
small girl. , ’
Miss Duggan s contribution to the opening pro-
gramme was the recitation “Billy’s Bose” (most
of audience in tears at close) and a dazzling
billowing robe of pink chiffon. As the manage-
ment had expected about 5000 persons, and got
some 20,000, the cookies and ices at the refresh-
ment tallies were “off” early in the evening.
But a Government House crowd at a garden
party isn’t always as orderly and good-tempered
as was the crush at Wonderland. At two o’clock
on Sunday morning Mr. Anderson and his ex-
hausted staff of managers and organisers came
into Sydney and sat down to an ante-dawn
breakfast, which was also the previous night’s
hours 61 "’ PrOSperity drives pe °P le t 0 feed at strange
• a re sidence three-quarters of a century
in Bathurst, seventy-three years of which were
passed in one house on Jordan Creek, Mrs Agnes
Busby, on Nov. 26, joined the Big Camp at the
great age of 97 years. She was the widow of Dr.
George Busby, Assistant Colonial Surgeon in the
days of the System ; she married him in 1833
She came to Australia (and to Bathurst) two
years before that (in 1831), with her brother, Rev.
1. 1 hompson, the first Presbyterian minister
appointed to the town. The Busbies were numerous
in JN.o. Wales in the twenties. There were John
senior and junior, and William of Darlinghurst’
George of Bathurst, Alexander of Cassilis, and
James of 1< albrook, St. Patrick’s Plains. One
Busby (James) was appointed British Resident at
Bay of Islands, Maoriland, under the Governor
of i\ew South Wales. Another conveyed water
* rolxl Botany Swamp to Sydney in 1872
and the pipes are still to be seen at points on the
road to Botany. They seem to have buzzed round
very earnestly, those old Busbies.
Sydney has a corner in clever girls. Some
results of their cleverness—no, skill is the better
word—are displayed in a room at Vickery’s
Chambers. The show is an Exhibition of Aus-
tralian applied art. There is a book case in silky
oak, with a “bullock team” design on leather,
portrait frames, umbrella stands, and decorative
panels, all artistically carved art designs, and all
purely Australian—flowers, foliage, and seed-pods
Ihe currajong, the waratah, the woody pear’
and that curious long, very long, pea
that grows wild about the South Coast—Nature
must have fashioned these specially with a view
to their being applied in art to copper lock-
plates, copper vases, panels and frames. Por-
t eres, dados and friezes are also “ treated ” with
charming Australian designs. And the bookbind-
m?r. » tra ,• po , ets bound in Australian-born
calf by Australian-born damsels ! One book has
the hair on. It is bound in a baby-calf’s brown
and cream hide, and it smells quite nice, as if the
volume had gambolled in clover.
An Australienne in London thus fluffs in a
private letter: “Saw the gilded ‘Billy’ Lawson
driving with Delia Mason. Shame ! He ought
to be in his own country giving the girls driving
exercise. Carrie Moore is so toned-down that
she would be, in Sydney’s opinion, almost tone-
less and lifeless But England likes its stage
girls that way. They like the Delia Mason kind

dottily in love with her. Her figure is divine-
a slender Venus de Medici type tempered by
marvellous corsets. She makes the funniest and
most fascinating little moues when singing. Her

the fixed, tranced stare of young first love. In
clothes, every blessed thing is ‘ hand-made,’and
vilely expensive in consequence. But, of course
you ve not waited for me to tell you this. We
are sick of the word ‘ hand-made, 5 but it is sup-
posed to convey perfection. A small niece of
mine asked me if the world was hand-made by

maae.
beems that it is a breach of naval law for out-
sider boats to fly a Union Jack. The other day
®* e ® trlc kroneh with a Jack flying was buzzing
to Watson s Bay when it was chased by a pinnace
from the Pah fl and made to haul down the rag.
What wouM have happened if the launch had put
out the Royal btandard to dry ? The Pab’f 1
would have sunk it, for sure, with a shot. Also,
what would have happened if the launch had
kept in front and raced for its life through the
Heads ? Presumably, as the British tar never
gives up, the two vessels would be at Maoriland
Exhibition by now.
Cable says that Miss Elyda Russell, piamste,
of Sydney, has made a successful appearance at
the Bechstein Hall in London. Cannot meet
anyone who knows the new hand on the ivories.
Palings cannot place her, neither can Maestro
Sykes. She is referred to by some paper as a
niece of the late millionaire Russell, the bene-
°f Sydney University. Talking of players,
the Maorilander, Magnus Laing Meason, who is
studying in Berlin, sends a portrait of himself at
the piano. His hair is in the usual duck’s tail,
like his maestro’s, and his hands are gathered
curiously high over the keyboard—as if they were
a condor going to swoop down on a horse. His
playing name is now “Magnus de la Laing.”
After a concert tour of Italy, the youngster will
make his debut in Berlin a year hence.
If “ The Midnight Wedding ” were played by
actors in civilian clothes it would be but a minor
success. The man who wrote it wrote with his
tongue in his cheek and his eye on Wfiman.
“ Cive her uniforms,” he said, “ blazing military
uniforms. Let every man be uniformed, and let
his sword clank against his armed heel, and let
there be a wedding.” All the alarms and ex-
cursions and night surprises, the roll of drums and
clash of steel, have for their raison d’etre the love
affair of one woman—not a foreign foe armed to
the whiskers and bent upon wiping a kingdom
off the map. A wedding and scarlet clothes are
the supports of the drama. The wedding isn’t a
bit smart, ’as are those that occur in Sydney
and the backblocks, and most of the red hussars
are bandy or circular in the legs. No matter—a
woman gets married, and the ’groom is in uni-
form. So the Criterion is crammed with women,
and the dramatist s faith in their primal instincts
is justified. The wicked woman of the scarlet
drama is, by way of contrast, robed in black-
severe, unrelieved, long, close, clinging black
velvet, and a big black cavalier hat laden
with feathers, totters on her head. Satanella is
she named, “by merit raised to that bad
eminence.” Miss Di Cooper plays the part, and
looks as Gibson Girly as Camille Clifford in her
long black velvet sheath.
Two innocent white frocks of the same pattern,
two strings of pearls around two round throats,
two greenstone ornaments of the same carving—
all these two-things are to be found in the por-
traits of the Maoriland twins, Aileen and Doris
Woods. The bunch of “press opinions” that
accompany the pictures simply exude apprecia-
tion of the youngsters’ singing and dancing of
Maoriland airs and measures. But one paper
marvels how a voice can indulge in those weird
Maori war cries and still retain its quality. The
twins and Miss Maud Fitzstubbs are booked for a
20 weeks engagement, commencing in May, 1907.
Next writer from London who tells me of our
Australian artists, whether players or singers,
living on charity and eating the 'pro bono publico
sandwich, will be asked for names. lam begin-
ning to have cheerful doubts about the stranded
Australienne in London. The Twins are making
money, and are never out of an engagement. The
Griffith trio of sisters get a fairly good living.
One contralto, I am told, gets ten shillings an
appearance, but then she generally appears after-
noon and evening somewhere or other, and has no
need to eat the free sandwich. None of these
artistes could, by the practice of their art,
earn the price of" their evening gloves and cab
fares in Australia. For that matter, no artist
can, no matter what his or her quality. We
haven’t the population, and the qualified one has
to be dissatisfied with the drudgery of teaching.
Staell and Allpress have to teach. Burns Walker
has to lift his fine baritone for pupils. England
offers a lot of chances at Dover, Chelsea, Brighton,
Scarborough, and the like for the clever enough
warbler or player ; so, after all, England is a good
foster-hen, and we will continue to shoo the
musical chick off these maternal premises on to
those of the old bird with the wider wings.
Miss Winifred Austin, who went hence some
months ago with Miss Jean Brenan, the florist,
has married in London. Her accomplice is actor
Leslie Victor, a smart little mummer who was
here years ago with the Broughs. Victor and his
bride are coming out in the Julius Knight Co.
Ola Jane’s “ Dearest ” has sent her, all the way
from America, a frock so beautiful that it would
“ make you leave your happy home.” The phrase
is Ola Jane’s, and its fascination is lost in quota-
tion because the accent can’t be reproduced. Ola
Jane is Miss Humphrey, of the Waldron Co.,
and perhaps it would be wise to mention that
“Dearest” is her mother. The garment that
■would make you quit your comfortable, deep-
verandahed villa to gaze upon it is heaven-blue
silk muslin and white lace. The lace is inset and
offset and everything that is bewildering; the
gown is Princess in construction, and as for the
rest—well, Ola Jane’s sea-green eyes and burnt
amber hair will do the rest.
The heavy responsibility of a matrimonial
engagement rests upon Ola Jane. Miss Eileen
King, one of a group of handsome sisters, nieces
of Mrs. Spencer Brunton, has met her fate through
the artiste presenting the right man to her. “He
never loved who loved not at first sight,” as
Shakspeare has it. This man loved at first sight.
The matrimonial outlook for the forty de-
butantes of last winter, and the 1040 of the few
years before last winter, is quite gloomy. To have
any chance now you must be a widow, and how
can you be a widow if you never married at all,
and how can you bury the deceased if he wasn’t
dead, or even alive ? The latest causes for these
profound reflections are Mrs. Andrew Chisholm,
of Goulburn, Mrs. Inglis, of “Hillside ” (one of a
squatting family), and now is mentioned the
engagement of another widowed squatteress,
mother of one of the prettiest of younger Sydney
girls.
_At the annual meeting of the High School Old
Girls’ Union it was decided to make an endeavor
to strengthen the feeling of fellowship between
the members, and at the same time to perpetuate
the name of the old school in some useful way.
Accordingly, it was resolved to erect a shelter at
the Thirlmere Home for Consumptive Women.
To do this the sum of £65 is needed, which will
endow a shelter that will accommodate two women
at a time. To raise this sum a bazaar has been
decided upon, to take place in the High School, on
December Bth, from 3 to 10 p.m. Joint hon. secs,
are Mrs. Britton, of Lennon-street, Mosinan; Miss
Amy Mack, Citizens’ Chambers; and Dr. I.
Coghlan, Hyde Park.
Sir Alfred Cooper, a Knight Bachelor, who is
connected with a Big Tea Concern, and who
maintained a private hospital during the S.A.
war for wounded Tommies, is at the Australia
with his monkey and his 'sob. The monkey sits
■on the knight’s shoulder, and the pair have been
photographed together. Probably Jacko belongs
to a collateral branch of its owner’s family tree,
and before Adam the families threw cocoa-nuts
together at the missing link.
Some beautiful photographs of Madame Nora
Dane-Valenti are on view at Falk’s. One end of
a Limerick lace scarf is gathered on her hair, and
the remainder falls upon one shoulder and is
draped upon the corsage. Her Mexican parrot
accompanies Madame when she is singing in her
room, and joins in at the end of each line,
pitching its voice in the correct key. Madame’s
first concert occurs in a fortnight.
Country hotels in N.S.W. are, as a rule, so
very bad as to take away most of the pleasures of
touring. A holiday with bad food and poor
lodging loses much of its bloom. Out of philan-
thropy then I let the public know that the Hotel
Oriental, Springwood, has now fallen into the
hands of a German with a passion for cleanliness
and good cooking. It is an oasis in the Blue
Mountain desert, on the way to that other more
considerable oasis, the Medlow Hydro.
Widow of late Justice George Long Innes—no
longer a widow—has decided to turn into cash the
stock of wines in the cellars of “ Winslow,” Dar-
ling Point. As she married the ex-French Consul
at Sydney, and now resides in the champagne
country, it would be painting the lily, or pouring
liquor over the hotel, or something of the sort, to
take the old family drink to her new home.
Mr. Resch, the brewer, is saying aftfwieder-
sehen (this word must be pronounced carefully).
He goes for a trip by the German liner, leaving
next Saturday.
The garden fete in Mrs. A. G. Ralston’s
grounds realised over £2OO for that most worthy
charity, the Crown-street Women’s Hospital.
Mrs. John Anderson died at Esrom, near
Bathurst, on Saturday, aged 76 years. She had
a family of 15 children, 11 of whom are still living.
Esrom is a somewhat historic suburb of the City
of the Plains. Close by is Mt. Pleasant, the estate
of J. H. Stewart, whose father, Major-General
Stewart, was Acting-Governor in 1825 for 18 days.
At Esrom, too, is Bradwardine, the old home of
F. B. Suttor, and the only house outside Sydney
wherein an Executive Council meeting has been
held. Other old homesteads thereabouts are the
house of Mr. T. J. Hawkins, Gold Commissioner
at the Turon in the fifties, and father of
Dame Suttor, and the domicile originally owned
by Whittingdale Johnson, Crown Lands and Gold
Commissioner, and afterwards Stipendiary Magi-
strate at Sydney.
Queen Alexandra was sixty-two years young
on Saturday. Portraits of her continue to show
her as twenty-two. If a woman is only as old as
she looks in her photo, then the Queen is
younger by many years than her junior offspring.
Almost the most gorgeous thing in the way of
furniture is the catalogue of the goods and chattels
of a cleric who is about to shake the loam of
Australia off his feet and go back to the country
whence he was imported. The description of
the handsome art sideboards, highbaclced chairs,
massive oak extension dining table, tier dinner
waggon with mirrors, etc., valuable Indian
carpets, luxurious Chesterfield settee,' ladies’ easy
arm chair to match, piano, Chippendale suite
in Lyons silk damask, etc., etc., suggests that
things have looked up in the apostolic line since
the “Sign of the Cross” days. Then Marcus
Superbus had all the furniture, and the Early
Christians hardly mustered a sound chair among
them.
King Edward was unable to be present at the
Florentine Night, given by the Royal Sydney
Yacht Squadron (of which he is president),
last Friday, in the club grounds. Yice-Com-
modore Walter Reeks tdok his place, and filled
it quite as ably, but without the crown and scep-
tre which Edward always wears in the evenings.
A number of the women guests were in evening
dress and picture hats, and there was a topaz
moon, a silky sea, a mile of Jap lanterns, and a
charming crowd that buzzed pleasantly.
The last big conversazione of the nearly faded
year was that given in the Town Hall to say a
civic and society good-bye to the Mayoral pair—
the Allen Taylors. The names of the committee
carried huge banking and political value, and all
the Pointer dames turned out to tell Mrs. Taylor
that she and Mister Mayor have a large bill
against the State for services rendered. Speeches,
presentations and flowers rained, and hopes were
spoken that the city will get a pair as useful and
charitable for its next civic year.
It was a great disappointment to Melba that
her son’s health did not allow him to continue his
studies for the army. Pictures of him and the
girl he is to marry show him to be a gentle-faced
youth, while she is a pleasant, everyday tennis-
girl.
I struck some of the outer fringes of politics
during the past week. A woman told me that
she was going to vote for Mr. Reid because he
had saved Australia from disgrace by rescuing
some wrecked Chinese sailors whom the Labor
party had refused permission to land, and taking
them to the shelter of his own house and giving
them clothes to wear. She didn’t seem to see
any humor in the picture of Chinamen dressed in
Mr. Reid’s clothes. Also, another said that there
wouldn’t have been any Federation but for Mr.
Reid, and therefore, though Federation had
benefited other States at the expense of N.S.W.,
she thought it right to vote for him and oppose
the Socialistic designs of the other States for the
division of N.S.W.’s wealth. These and other
politics have made me so dizzy that I am going
to bed.
From the Maoriland Exhibition
The Australian visitors—guests of the Government-
are being royally entertained. In the intervals of view-
ing the Exhibition, and in order to counteract the effects
of so much whirling gaiety at races, dinners and other
frolics, pleasant excursions have been arranged, and,
under special guidance of Mr. W. S. Smith, of the Tourist
Department, these Australians are wandering into the
heart of the great mountains, fording rivers, drifting over
lakes, and considering the best efforts of the Almighty
generally. The trouble is that there is too much to b«
seen. It would take several years and many trips to use
up all the show places.
There is an erroneous idea in active circulation with
reference to hotel tariffs in the Isles of the Big Show.
Intending visitors to the Exhibition need have no fear of
being imposed upon. The enterprising Tourists’ Bureau,
under the superintendence of Mr. Donne, has gripped
the matter with both hands, and is hanging on
to it. Hundreds of comfortable rooms are on the Bureau
books, available at moderate tariffs that are controlled
by the Bureau management.
From a Brisbane correspondent:—
The complimentary concert tendered to Mrs. Gilbert
Wilson, on Monday evening, provided a good occasion for
the sporting of frocks and frills. His Majesty’s presented
quite a wide-awake appearance—the programme, how-
ever, was very so-so, with the exception of Mrs.
Wilson’s own numbers. The Leidertafel, with the assist-
tance of a choir of female choristers (which it would
have been much better without), gave a lightning exhibi-
tion of its imperfections, and the major portion of those
assisting did not seem up to their best. Mrs. Wilson has
seldom had a greater artistic triumph. Perhaps the
comparison made it seem better than it was. Her final
encore, “ To-night,” was sung at the express wish of the
shop girls, who packed the gallery, and with whom Mrs.
Wilson has always been a favorite (chiefly because she
remembers that they are women, and often tired at that).
It was fine, and floral trophies and pretty farewell gifts
were showered upon the stage.
All Queensland seems to be leaving for England next
week per Omrah. The Brothers White and their brides,
the Arthur Feez coup e, Mrs. Gilbert Wilson, -the
heavily-gilt Lairds ; Mrs. Smyth, the Gympie widow of
wealth ; and a host of smaller fry.
Pretty Margaret Ferguson, our Queensland composer,
gave a badl.v-arranged recital last week. It served, how-
ever, to show her power and versatility. Songs, noc-
turnes, mazurkas and orchestral music flow with equal
tunefulness from her pen. Miss Ferguson goes to England
in January for a year’s study and concert-going.
Lady Chelmsford presided at a meeting of the Central
Children’s Ministering League on Thursday afternoon,
and, as usual, hit the nail on the head by expressing
regret at the absence of the children. “ Next year,” said
her Ex., “ I hope both they and my own children will
take part in a similar gathering.” Isn’t it like a church-
run show to have a shivoo of officers, and forget all about
the league members themselves?
The new Society of Artists opened its doors on
Thursday afternoon at the Town Hall, prior to which
their Exes, had a private view, and expressed, it is
said, a flattering opinion of the pictures and pottery.
Pretty Mrs. Grout, wife of the Consul for Spain, carried
off honors with a sunset scene. Colclough, the sec., has,
as usual, some good work, while Wirth and Addison are
also to the fore. Old O. Fristram show's a fine portrait
head of Miss Constance Petre (in a black mantilla). An
interesting exhibit is a case of Brisbane pottery hand-
painted by one Denis or Ted O’Brien.
Yours Affectionately, Akenehi.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbouknk, December 4, 1906.
My Dear Yarbik.—
Dame Talbot goes round with leisurely grace
opening up tea-cosy fetes for the needy, bhe has
a friendly smile that lights up her pallor, and
that same smile terminates a few remarks very
pleasantly. It trails after her words and sweetens
her talks. Also, it’s a rather young smile. It
haunts her grey years with happy intent, and
reduces middle age to comparative youth every
time it happens. Our sex doesn’t preserve its
smiling to any extent. The decay of teeth, the
influx of wrinkles, the lean wintry years, leave
little chance for a sweet lighting up of the
countenance. One must have a happy nature
plus a set of good original eating tools, to make
a happy half-laugh like that of Dame lalbot
possible in the autumn days.
All social Melbourne is disposed to purchase
pasteboards for an amateur bill of melody, designed
to provide a feast for stranded Jack Tars on the
Great Day of Plenty. It’s not that the dukes of
Melbourne and their duchesses are anxious about
the hard-up boys in blue, but the performers in-
clude Mrs. Vallange, Miss Lesly Madden, and
other fashionables. There would probably be
just as much real enthusiasm if the idea were to
get up a Christmas dinner for decayed Jews.
The pathetic news of Mrs. Lionel Buckland’s
death was cabled out last week, bringing a shock
to Mrs. Aitken’s family and a big circle of Mel-
bourne chums. Mrs. Buckland was the youngest
and the prettiest of the brewery Aitkens. Some
years ago, the small, pastel-like beauty, after
two seasons of innumerable conquests, married
the man whose trousers had the best Bond-street
cut and the most beautiful crease in this metro-
polis. The pair drifted to the Cold Country,
where much of their prosperity dwindled.
Tidings still came, however, of the little dame’s
porcelain charm.
The massive son of the Chief Justice, whose
plump form gives the kilt, when he dons it, the
distended circumference of a crinolined petticoat,
is becoming one of the crack motorists hereabouts.
He took part in the recent reliability race and
toot-tooted into a foremost position among the
survivors. Captain Guy Madden may look like
the fat boy from “Pickwick,” but he can control
a petrol car better than most, and beat a gale of
wind when he really lets her go. Another thing,
he doesn’t bounce any. While every bone is
shaken and rattles dismally in the lean man,
the massive Madden boy sits as steady as a gaso-
meter. A big advantage is fat in a motor. It
is ballast—a comfortable, settled kind of ballast
which fills the bill as nothing else can.
It’s a blessing that many of the excitements and
pleasures of this hairpin sex of ours are cheap and
harmless. I sat out the toilette preparations of a
stylish Lilian the other day, and actually shared
some of the obvious joy she was extracting from
tying her pretty clothes on. She is a luxurious
person over her frills. She fastened her bebe
ribbons with a glad chuckle, and patted down
the frothy Val. that coasted her petticoat edge in
a truly enjoyable way, and fingered the top-laces
that trellis-worked her chest lovingly. Then
she slipped on, her skirt, and there were
more tender pats and strokes. A blouse was
added to the dainty collection. Ten minutes
were spent arranging this —every hook met every
eye with a happy air. The belt was fastened
into position after much pleasant fuss. Pinally
the head-gear was attached with tender care, and
gloves were extracted from a scented sachet.
Then she said, with a glad little laugh, that she
was ready. No man that I ever heard of laughs a
glad little laugh when he puts on his belltopper
simply out of gladness at his top-hat. And we
were only going to an auction sale of pictures.
Think of the happy consciousness of those
clothes ! It haunted me. It held her. What
chance has the thrilling kiss of Edwin against
Angelina’s love of her bebe ribbons ?
There was a big crowd at the Menzies concert
on Saturday. It was a high-priced bill of varie-
gated song designed to help on the memorial fund
of the fallen Australians buried in S’Africa. No
stylish feminine considered the object much. It
was enough that a pair of Exes, were promised
as a spectacular item, and the brew of cheer was
to be given gratis. This last was Norman
Menzies’ idea of getting a big crush, and he got it.
The hotel manager knows better than most how
the skirted element like eating without charge.
The Talbottles filed from one concert scene
to another (a couple were in simultaneous
progress) and even looked cheerful when the
Pierrots pantomimed some Mary Ann refrains.
A striking personage was Miss Malcolm —a re-
turned gadder with soft chestnut coils in sympa-
thy with her brown millinery, and a gentle, in-
gratiating eye.
A surprise at this show was the resurrection of
Judge Molesworth’s eldest chick—Elaine—after
a long oblivion. The prolonged tour in other
lands has changed her more than a globe-trot does
most of our frivollers. From a girlish charmer of
uncertain outline and chubby countenance, the
blithe Miss Molesworth has developed into a
straight-fronted glass of fashion, and her face
would be severe were it not that the family
dimples come to the rescue and show that young
joy is in her still.
Mrs. Norman Menzies, billed as “Dorothy
Vane,” was the surprise of the recent Charity
matinee. In blush-pink chiffon and a hat blush-
ing en suite , the little, deep-throated warbler
looked as juvenile as in the first days of “The
Geisha.'’
Miss Olive Morrel does not go strutting in the
panto, boy rig, afterall. Possibly she wouldn’t do at
the Firm’s Private View, or perhaps her Please-Go-
Gently style is too irresistible and the Firm feels
that she is too valuable a girl to be spared. Possi-
bly, also, Miss Young yearned to put on the pink
suit that gives so much advantage to her natural
appointments.
From high quarters come rumors of a well-
known Melbourne girl’s romantic attachment to
a Polish Count. ’Tis said that the family pooh-
poohed the idea of the foreign alliance, but as the
beauty clung: to her Pole, her father and mother
have gone forth, sans prejudice, on a visit of
inspection.
The Yarra Sculptors’ Society opens its annual
show of clay, pastel, daub, and copper on Dec.
21st, about the time the fatted goose prepares to
bow its neck to the Christmas axe.
I have been looking with a twisted smile upon
the girl with the giddy Mama, and I’m sorry for
the little Miss. There are lots of her about, but
in this special instance the case is really not comic
—it’s pathetic. Mama flirts without discretion.
She canvasses actively for masculine smiles and
attention, and, being dainty as well as mis-
chievous, she gets them. The little Miss looks
on with the chilled, uncomplaining regard of an
octogenarian saint. There’s a certain old wisdom
in her quiet air ot endurance. Her own young
heart, that should be, as it were, playing kiss-in-
the-ring out in the gay world, is shut up in a
philosophical cloister. In fact, her life is spoilt,
and the gay Mama suspects the chick has
inherited her Popper’s sedateness or a stylish
boredom. She doesn’t dream how things really
are with the sensitive soul of the girl.
Femininity would have plunged readily into the
new little pastel-toned booklet that bears the
seductive title, “ The Shrine of Desire,” had the
verse-maker responsible for the small volume
omitted a preface which rambles over much
poetic, philosophic and idealistic ground, and
drifts into the observation that “the woman who
uses her body as a clothes-rack is as a brake upon
the progress of the world.” Also, it includes this
other unflattering reference —“To see their women
folk tightly-corseted, empty-headed, futile, grasp-
ing, vain and aggressive, gorgeous with their bar-
barous hats and gowns —the products of sweated
years of toil.” Mr. Rupert Atkinson can’t expect
the sex to worship at his “Shrine of Desire ” after
that savage attack. Yet the booklet is an artistic
article, and has some sweet thoughts.
So many books of spring verse, mostly amatory
and moonlighty, are on the market that now
every spouse who grows taciturn and sulky with
his life-mate is suspected of compiling a volume
addressed to the rest of the sex. A dame of my
acquaintance reckons her hubby, whom she calls
“Crosspatch,” is toiling to bring out such a
volume. “But I shan’t discourage the dear,”
she wound up in a laconic tone. “ I’d rather have
a book for a rival than some cat who’d teach him
hypocrisy and humbug.”
Clarence Weber, the muscle showman and
wrestler, is about to follow the example of his
brown antagonist Buttan Singh, for he will lead
a Mrs. Weber from the altar on the 19th of this
month. There’s nothing of the Sandow girl
about the bride-elect. She’s a pocket edition of
loveliness, and her name is Peck (not bushel).
Another example of the natural law of selection
is to be found in this union of big brawn and
small daintiness.
The chestnut switch that adds a look of luxury
to the meagre head of the stylish She brought a
big laugh to an assorted assemblage, the other
day, at an aquatic show. One of the strenuous
swimmers was in the midst of distinguishing her-
self above all others when the brown coils, that
were buffeting the high waves in a series of ducks,
dips and somersaults, loosened, and upon the sur-
face of the deep a long, expensive, chestnut
switch went sailing off on its own, while the pro-
prietress, shorn of much of her glory, shed morti-
fied tears into the brine. A current of giggles
ran along the ranks of the onlookers. Fancy any
sea-nymph inured to the rude elements and the
mischances of the hour relying on a treacherous,
artificial switch ! To wear a wig in the water
seems the acme of folly.
The Malcolm M‘Eacharns haven’t yet finished
burning their Australian boats behind them, or
shaking the dust of this country off their feet.
The other day some showy nags of theirs were put
up for a bid in the public market-place. There is
little else left as a MJEacharn reminder. But he
will continue to draw his dividends from this land.
Ho Jolly Jenkins, of the Order of the Unshaved
Shagpat, is off gadding to Colombo. His jaunt is
the beginning of an elderly programme of leisure.
At the end of his leave, he quits his post in the
local House of Babel. Never more will his beau-
tifying Lord’s Prayer, elocuted at the Parlia-
mentary opening, move the multitude to piety.
But a book of memoirs is threatened, and that
volume will tell how he waved his hand and did
the thing properly.
The Fitchett College was the scene of an Old
Girls’ Corroboree last week. All the seasoned
Methodists put in an appearance, and seemed
to see no humor in the unveiling of a picture
representing a group of the oldest The painful
significance of the thing may have bruised a few
feelings, yet it made none of the Old Girls grin
cynically" But the hair-pin sex seldom does grin
in that particular way. It’s either thoroughly
good-humored, and laughs till its jolly sides ache
inside its corset, or it bites its lips hard and tries
the strength of its claws. Cynic is masculine, and
the feminine of cynic is cat, and the female of
cynicism is caterwaul.
Mrs. A’Beckett rallied together many idle
flutterers at her Armadale home last Tuesday, and
genial weather conditions gave the frills a sunny
show. The hostess herself was rigged in glisten-
ing grey, with dashes of black to avert too gay an
impression. The one single chick of the house
wore a smilesome forget-me-not blue. It’s a
becoming youthful hue. Woe betide the crow-
footed female who attempts to put her fifty odd
years of beauty-wreckage inside a forget-me-not
rig !
Bishop Stone-Wigg—these clerical hyphens are
subtly persuasive—addressed the peerage and
aristocracy at Mandeville Hall, the other day, on
the matter of the New Guinea heathen. It was
Mrs. Ross-Soden’s own notion, and the Toorak
flutterers rallied to the call. The gaitered one said
many things with an engaging smile, and, as costly
refreshments helped on his appeal, some cash
should result. But no expensive Toorak maiden
rose and declared her intention of devoting her
life to the coons of Papua, and teaching the
black baby its alphabet, and ministering to the
poor and afflicted gin. That kind of enthusiasm
doesn’t grow at Toorak.
A bright girl, with fetching ways and the
practical mind of the elder twenties, sends along
a motor complaint. She was spending the day
with Adolphus in the green-and-gold neighbor-
hood of Healesville, and had retained her com-
plexion cleverly and her eye-shine wonderfully.
Percival, urged on by these charms, and by a
gentle breeze that was amorously loafing among the
gums, and a sky that was one expansive blue hope,
was on the point of submitting his destiny to her
care and charge when a vile machine toot-tooted
from the green distance, and distracted Geoffrey’s
attention. Next it went slap-bang into a huge
old tree-trunk, and there were screams and com-
motion. Augustus rushed to the rescue, spent an
hour restoring order, and then took his girl home
abruptly. She hasn’t had a fair chance to speak
to Alphonso since. Hence her grievance. Motors
shouldn’t come to interfere with a sentimental
climax. It may be that the names in this par
have become a little mixed, but there is nothing
mixed about the grievance.
The most successful hospital graduate I’ve ever
met hails from the Harbor neighborhood. She
owns up to five operations. She came out of each
of them minus part of her anatomy, and now
pretty well walks abroad without any interior.
She looks charming. In fact, her cheerfulness
and sunny health are a horrible temptation to one
to be rid of all one’s troublesome interior in the
same way. But it’s wise to wait, and consider
awhile, and know if anything untoward happens
to the three-quarter dame who has, so far, got
along magnificently with 25 per cent, knocked off.
Senator Best’s pretty chick stepped lightly on
delicate feet to the altar the other day with an
imported young person named Broad. Miss
Beatrice Best is the second Best in the double-
barrelled family of the Senator.
The picnicker is getting active. She is peculiar
to the hot season, and bestirs herself when the
Social top has entirely ceased spinning. One has
to be a general lover to endure the drag picnic.
The opportunities afforded to a couple who want
to hold hands, and are accustomed to holding
hands all the time, and want always to hold the
same hands, are nil at a picnic omnium gatherum.
There you have to hold any old hand that comes
your way, or hang about loose.
A shirt created a sensation in a polka-scene the
other evening. A bachelor sported it, and bore
the blushing honors of the sensation with much
embarrassment. Other Johnnies rushed to
ask him his mercer’s address. Matrons, jealous
for the up-to-date spruceness of their hubbies,
worried him with inquiries, and finally every
girl wanted to rest her head on the novel, softly-
tucked ches-tprotector. JThe bachelor grew so
unhappy that he left before the programme was
half through, wearing the pallid countenance of
the ghost-haunted and the look of one ready to
suicide in a bowl of claret cup. Fancy how a She
would have crowed at creating anew thatch or
dimple or petticoat sensation ! The glory of it!
But then the other cats wouldn’t have asked who
her barber was or what dimple factory she
patronised. Only the he-sex would have been
oceans nicer to her, without exactly knowing why.
“ Rosna ” writes from Adelaide: —
A statue of a handsome young man named Colone
Light, who once committed the indiscretion of laying
out Adelaide, and from all I can learn didn’t get much
thanks for it, was unveiled the other day. The thing is
the work of Birnie Bhind, and is one of the best images
this much-bestatued village can boast. It has an
excellent position, close to the Post Office, where
it blots out the figure of Victoria in the back-
ground. This is no great loss. Her Majesty may have
been a very nice queen, but her statue isn’t ornamental.
His Ex. unveiled Colonel Light before a crowd of ancient
settlers and a pair of celebrities. The women present
wore hot, elaborate toilets, and looked unhappy. The
only cool blot on the burning landscape was the pretty
pale blue creation worn by Mrs. Herbert Bymill, who has
just returned from honeymooning in the Cup State.
A more frilly crowd went along to the unveiling of the
Hughes statue at the University the next day. Walter
Hughes was one of the founders of Adelaide hall of eru-
dition, and this memorial of him was presented to the
authorities by his nephews. The unveiling was com-
mitted by Mrs. Walter Duncan and his Excellency Le
Hunte, assisted by Chief Justice and Chancellor Way, and
propped up by Mr. J. J. Duncan. These people pro-
vided the requisite cataract of well-chosen remarks.
A brilliant Adelaide damsel, Miss Eleanor Cowper-
thwaite, has just wrested her M.A. degree with first-class
classical honors from the ’Varsity. The girleen, who is
little more than 24, has been teaching at the Methodist
College for three years, and did not attend a single lec-
ture, so that her success is something extra.
Mr. Henry Dutton, of Anlaby, the person who loves to
be called “ squire,” has had a new and extensive yacht
built in Great Big Britain, his other yacht having become
overworked carrying vice-regal and celebrated folk.
The new vessel is timed to plough the wild waves hither
some time in December. Its furnishings and general
accoutrements are said to be quite intense. It is rumored
that Mr. Dutton intends sailing in his own fleet of one
vessel to Japan and other brown countries thereabouts.
A story came to light recently about an Adelaide cen-
tenarian, Mrs. Stead, who has reached the age of 102.
About 1865 a man named Sach bought some land from
the old lady’s family on the annuity plan. He agreed to
pay £l5O a year for the property until the death of Mr.
and Mrs. Stead, when all liability would cease. Sach
paid Stead steadily till he died. Then his brother
and heir, who was also Sach, took on the burden,
but the Steads saw him out also. Then the trustees of
Sach 11. said that it seemed their luck was out, and re-
fused to have any more to do with the business, and Mrs.
Stead, who had already received over £3OOO, got back the
land to comfort her declining years.
Adelaide lost one of its sweet girl graduates the other
day—Miss Millie Clark, B.A. She was only 25, and held
the position of classical mistress at the Advanced School
for Girls, a seminary that gathers in most of the educa-
tional honors of this State. She was taken ill quite
suddenly, and died within a day or two of meningitis.
Miss Clark was a clever and charming damsel, and one of
a clan that is addicted to the learned habit of graduating.
Dr. Ennis, chief director of noise at Elder Conserva-
torium, has fled to Europe for the vacation, and to recap-
ture his wife, Mrs. Ennis is secretary to that excellent
caper, the society for the invention (or is it prevention ?)
of cruelty to tram-horses and other archaeological curi-
osities. She was made a special constable in this con-
nection, but the wear-and-tear of handcuffing offending
trams and dragging them off to prison proved too much
for her health, and she was obliged to go to Britain to
recuperate. Directly the Conservatorium closed the
Doctor tore his hat off the nail and, leaping over all
obstacles, fled away to join her.
Miss Dorothy Gee, an Adelaide maiden who was lately
married in the Parent Land, advertised Australia by
having her wedding-cake ornamented with a pattern of
kangaroos. The necessary male appurtenance to the
proceedings was a young English medico.
Yours Affectionately, Tkyphena.
At the Chinese benefit, given in Adelaide
to the visiting Commissioner Hwang Cheng, the
local Consul for Japan aired his knowledge of
matters Chow by proposing the health of the
great reformer Kang Yue Wei. Now, it seems
that the Chow Court offers a reward of 50,000
dollars for that reformer’s head. So it was calcu-
lated to be a harassing moment for Hwang Cheng,
who probably got out of the difficulty by pre-
tending to drink the toast and spilling the liquor
down his capacious petticoat.

that the cow was the greatest factor for unrighteousness
in the country places, and the chief cause of Sabbath
breaking.
Evidently the idea that the devil goes about like a
ravening lion is incompatible with modern
thought and Australian conditions. Here, at
least, he is a “fair cow.”
They call him President Loosespelt in
Uncle Sam’s country now.
J. E. West, Greid’s opponent in East
Sydney, is a Londoner, 10 years younger and four
stone fitter than the Yes-No person. As a pro-
moter of the marriage-tie and the birth-rate
problem he goes nine children and three grand-
children better than Reid, though on the other
hand Reid is one dog (the dry animal) ahead of
West. As a boss West has the confidence of his
workmen and his clients. He has been a
Democrat under Gladstone in England and under
George Grey in Maoriland.
Melbourne has an artist who is the image
of Holman Hunt’s Christ—cherubic
visage, curling beard, china blue eyes
with an expression of gentle humility,
all the characteristics are there.
Also, he affects a few miles of
black underskirt, or something,
as an adornment for his neck.
There is another artistic being
who bears a strong facial re-
semblance to Hyne’s Captain
Kettle, but is otherwise the
mildest - mannered creature
who never breathes a
“damn.”
Alf. Conroy, of the Werriwa (N.S.W.),
left the platform the other night, went down
among his audience, seized a man who had in-
curred his dislike, and fired him out of the door.
Before he got into Parliament he used to go round
Sydney as one of the Parkes gang. One night at
North Shore a man entered the tram car in which
Parkes, Conroy and others were seated, and didn’t
show that appreciation of Parkes which Conroy
considered essential. Conroy fired him off. The
car was going rapidly, and for a while it wasn’t
known how many of the party would be indicted
for manslaughter. The vehicle was stopped, and
people got off to search for the body. The man,
however, had melted away, and a great political
trial was averted.
Chamberlain’s Tablets cleanse and in-
vigorate the stomach, and leave the bowels in a
natural condition, while pills are more harsh in
effect, and their use is usually followed by con-
stipation.*
At Longreach (Q.) the other day W.
Kewley, secretary of the Longreach branch of
the A.W.U., handed in his Union ticket. “A
faithful machine,” was the brief description
of the character of “Bill” Kewley offered
by one who has worked with him in the
Labor movement of Queensland from its
inception. In constructive genius he was
deficient, but to his duties in the interests
of Labor he brought tireless energy and
faithfulness, and he ranked as one of the
most trusted leaders of the movement. “I
have lost one of my best friends,” was
the wire sent by Premier Kidston on hear-
ing of Kewley’s passing out.
Old Yic. politician Janies Mirams
tells The Bulletin, apropos a recent par,
how he came to mention his family in the
course of an electioneering fight. His op-
ponent, Tucker, had said he (Tucker) was
a native. Mirams replied that, though he
wasn’t himself a native, he was the father
of many good natives. But, “I never had
occasion at any of my numerous contests to
rest my claim on anything beyond my poli
tical policy and my ability to advocate it.”
And the old man adds this rather pathetic
note : “ Don’t think me unduly jealous of
my political reputation ; but remember how
I have been unjustly robbed of my business
and personal reputation.”
Another Australian who has gained
abroad that appreciation denied him by
this importstricken country is A. E. Kit-
son, senior field geologist of Vie. Mines
Department. Kitson goes to do exploratory
geological work for the British Govern-
ment in Nigeria (Africa), at a salary of
£7OO per annum—just double the amount
Victoria paid him. He will root about in
Nigeria during the favorable season, and put
in the ague months classifying and writing
up his discoveries in the London Imperial
Institute.
N.S.W. public service has lost one of its
institutions by the death of Captain Edie, head
of the navigation department. In the ’Bo’s he was
one of the best-known skippers in the Union
S.S. Co.’s service. He left the sea to join the
Government service in 1890. Ten years later the
Labor party succeeded in abolishing the Marine
Board—an assemblage of well-meaning but in-
capable veterans—and out of the ruins arose a
comfortable billet, with the tremendous title of
Superintendent of Navigation, and Edie was
easily marked out for the job. What the captain
did not know of maritime matters wasn’t known
to anybody else, and his successor, now that
Columbus is dead, won’t be easy to find. He was
bearing his 66 years well, and looked good for a
long voyage yet, when his ship of life broke up
unexpectedly on the rock of pneumonia.
“ H. 8.” : Other times, other manners.
What a difference between the treatment of
Bill-Marion Edwards and Margaret Catch-
pole ! Margaret, if the legend is true, mas-
queraded in male attire to ride her em-
ployer’s horse 60 miles to the assistance of
her smuggler lover, and was sentenced to
death for horse - stealing.
Only by the exercise of
powerful influence was she
sent to N.S.W. as a lifer.
Bilarion, also in pants,
was charged with bur-
glary. Result : A few
humorous pars., a sym-
pathetic court, bail, a
circus engagement, a
speedy acquittal, and
much public semi-adula-
tion. Even the small
accident whereby Bil-
arion half-filled a lady
with small shot, during
her circus engagement,
would probably have
been a hanging matter for
Margaret.
Laborite W. M. Hughes waves a satirical
brolly at Spruce Myth in S.M. Herald :
Mr. Bruce Smith says that Mr. Fowler is apprehensive
that under Socialism knitting needles, hens, and fish-
hooks will be nationalised. Let Mr. Bruce Smith take
heart ; he will be able to follow his favorite occupations
unhindered. The spectacle of the great man unbending
in his moments of leisure to knit the useful sock or the
ornamental tie, to gather up the nutritive and mysterious
egg from the boastful hen, or hooking with bent pin the
skittish tittlebat, is one that no decent system would
willingly destroy.
John Longmuir, who in the not-very-long-
ago was John Haynes’ editor, but is now owner
of a little country paper, is opposing Austin
Chapman for Eden-Monaro. John is said by the
daily papers to be doing very well, but, if he is, it
£s due only to the tremendous boosting he is
receiving from the said daily papers. When
Johnny is wound right up and going at full speed,
it is quite impossible to understand him without
the aid of an interpreter. He is a Gael, or some-
thing like that, and persists in addressing Aus-
tralians in the language of the Hebrides. And the
language of the Hebrides is an awfu’ thing, ye ken.
THIS SPEAKS FOB ITSELF.
When Bishop Langley died, Bendigo
jibbed for a long time at every nominee whom the
cautious Archbishop Clarke suggested, and the
billet lay vacant for weeks. At last it has
gone to Archdeacon J. D., Langley, of Sydney,
brother of the last bishop. Brother Langley starts
to wear the apron at the age of 70. He was a
banlc manager before he took to buttoning his
waistcoat close up to his collar-stud, is a real good
sort, and as shepherd of the Rocks (Sydney)
always kept his flock from straying into sectarian
wrangles. The fact that he had The Bulletin
office in his parish used to please the Rev. J.D.L.,
though The Bulletin didn’t go to his church to
any extent.
When possessed with that tired feeling,
generally miserable, don’t relish your food, try a
dose of Chamberlain’s Tablets. They will make
you feel a new man, and give you an appetite.*
OLLY DEERING.—A MEMORY.
An old identity of Redfern (N.S.W.) was
buried last week at Rookwood. Mrs. Margaret
McLacblan was born at Islay, on the West Coast
of Scotland. In the early sixties, Donald, her
husband, who died 10 years ago, opened a grocery
at Redfern and made money. Her two sons
attained high positions in the public service.
One is Secretary to the Railway Commissioners,
and the other Public Service Commissioner for
the Commonwealth.
December birthdays include Opposition
leader Butler (S. A.), 56 on the 3rd ; Parson John
Watsford, 86, Dr. McKellar, 62, and Senator
Zeal, 76 on the sth; Tom Bent, 68, and Missionary
Dr. Brown, 71 on the 7th ; Sly, K.C., 57 on the

Carruthers, 49 on the 21st; Admiral- and Wes-
tralian Governor Bedford, 68, Dugald Thomsen,

Dr. Cawley, the well-known Adelaide
surgeon, died suddenly on November 26 while in
the very act of performing an operation. Fortu-
nately there was another doctor present, else the
patient would have had to wait in a partially cut-
up condition till more surgical aid could be found.
What are the odds against such a death as
Cawley’s ?
Thus “ Maori Mac ” :
Maoriland’s Defence Minister, Colonel Pitt, who died at
Christchurch recently, was a Tasmanian. His father was
harbor-master at Hobart in the early days. The Colonel
and two brothers arrived in Maoriland more than 40 years
ago. All three were called to the bar in Tasmania, and
afterwards practised in Ward’s State. Pitt entered the
House of Representatives about the sametime as Richard
Seddon, but retired after a few years’ service; he was
inserted in the Legislative Council six years ago. At the
time of his death he held three portfolios, and during
Ward’s jaunt abroad the Colonel cheerfully humped his
colleague’s burden along with his own. He was always
in the front of the stage, but never in the limelight, and
he died of overwork. He never called himself “ colonel,”
neither did he sport the title on his cards, and there was
no frill about him.
The Age told a story calculated to raise the
angry passions of Hodges, who went out to split
the Democratic vote at Kooyong to the joy of
Tory Knox. An M.P. called on Hodges to expos-
tulate. Hodges admitted he was in error, and
didn’t like the job. “But,” be said, “you had
better see Mrs. Hodges.” The M.P. made a
further effort to induce the distressed candidate
to withdraw. “No, sir,” was the reply, “you
must see Mrs. Hodges.” The M.P. accumulated
his courage in both hands and saw Mrs. Hodges,
and stated his case. “Withdraw! ” she said.
“No, he certainly shall do nothing of the kind.
He must go on. He’s as good a man as you, and
has as much right to be in Parliament. He won’t
retire; so there.” The Bulletin is reminded of
an energetic lady who hustled her hubby into
standing for a Ballarat district electorate, hustled
him through the campaign, and literally bundled
him into the House. “John sits in Parliament,”
said this worthy woman, “but Pm the member
for Bungaree.”
This interesting tale comes from Bris-
bane :
H. C. Ransome, who is carrying the draggled banner of
Anti-Sosh against Federal Attorney-General Groom at
Darling Downs (Q.) is a man with a grievance. In the
dim past, Horace sold two truck-loads of Warwick cedar
to a firm in Brisbane, and the firm paid him half-
rates for half-inch boards, whereas the custom of the
trade, it is alleged, was full rates for all boards under
the inch in thickness. Ransome considered he was
“balanced ” for about a century, and invoked the aid of
the law. The law wore long ears, and brayed forth a
non-suit. Appeal upon appeal were unsuccessful—the
law merely wagged its aural appendages, and remarked
“ haw.” Then the spirit of devilry moved in Horace, and
he lit out on the tortuous path of politics, determined to
ventilate that grievance about those boards in the
legislative halls of Brisbane, and he once got 37 votes at
Cunningham. There is a dark suspicion that he wants
to get into Federal politics so that he may tell the
Commonwealth all about the boards.
A SIMILE AND A MORAL.—“What
the dustman is to the dwelling in which we live,
that Hunyadi Janos is to the local habitation of
the human spirit.” Thus writes a well-known
medical writer.*
Asked what is the most frequent and annoying
pest which patronises this great Continent of ours, you’d
state, with one loud, unanimous voice, “ The Fly.” The
fly is more pestilent than snakes, dust-storms, mosquitoes
or even politics. When he swarms into your tea, on to
the most sensitive points of exposed skin area, or starts
to frivol with your dinner, your language towards him is
more emphatic than the words of the prophets. But
there is an antidote. And very “ anti ’’ master fly finds
it. After spreading Insectibane judiciously around, all
that is required for him is a broom and a cemetery.
Rocke Tompsitt and Co., proprietors of this blessed fly
exterminator, have received many grateful letters stating
that Insectibane is as deadly to the numerous cockroach
as to the man3 r other varieties of festive insects so skil-
fully designed to stimulate man’s activities in his hours
of ease.*
Bj a man who says he knows him :
Archdeacon Langley, of Sydney, who has received a
unanimous nomination to the Bishopric of Bendigo, left
vacant by the death of his brother, has one of the rarest
virtues of the times—he is charitable to a degree that
makes him liable to all kinds of imposition. Some ten
years ago, when N.S.W. was enjoying the blessings of
“Freetrade”—Langley was on Church Hill then, and
the unemployed were an affliction—his door was pounded
on at all hours. Even when the visitor breathed a huere
blast of beer on the cleric when the portal was opened,
or had a three-card apparatus sticking out of his
pocket, Langley didn’t seem to suspect. Men three
sheets in the wind used to tell him that they hadn’t eaten
for fourteen months or thereabouts, and if they didn’t
immediately fall down asleep on the footpath he helped
them, “for the times are really bad.” The unemployed
who used to meet at the Statue or in the Domain gener-
allyr marched in procession to Langley’s house, and, taking
him out, put him in front of them for an airing in the
streets. It was a suspicious, sneery and sarcastic time
with the employing classes, and an unlucky, squalid and
desperate time with the unemployed, and the figure of
the ingenuous Langley was pleasant for the eye to
rest on.
The story of a fine old telegraphist :
Veteran Charles Todd retires from the S.A. Government
Astronomership after 49 years' service. He was born at
Islington (Eng.) in 1826, and was reared at Greenwich,
where the big Time Manufactory is. He entered
Greenwich Observatory in 1841. In 1854 he was appointed
Superintendent of Telegraphs and Government Astrono-
mer in S. Australia, and arrived there in 1855. He found
no telegraphs to superintend. A year or so later a private
line was built from Adelaide to Port Adelaide, but the
State bought out the Private Enterprise concern,
and set Todd to work on a State line. The only
other telegraph lines in Australia at that time
were the Melbourne-Ballarat, Melbourne-Bendigo and
Melbourne-Williamstown connections. The Adelaide-
Port Darwin line is Todd’s greatest monument. He sub-
mitted a scheme to Governor Mac Donnell, who embodied
it, in a despatch to the Colonial Secretary in 1859, in the
days before any white man had crossed Australia.
(Explorer MacDouall Stuart’s march from Adelaide to the
Indian Ocean didn’t happen till some three years later.)
Nothing resulted. Todd again propounded his scheme
in a paper read before the Philosophical Society in 1863.
The paper was published in England, and that superior
country gave Todd the derisive laugh and the glassy eye.
The thing hung fire till 1870, and then came the Eastern
Extension Oo.’s offer to lay a cable from Singapore, via
Java, to Port Darwin to connect with a sug-
gested line around the Gulf of Carpentaria to
Queensland. Todd hauled out his scheme once
more, and this time he was listened to. The other
States declined to take a hand in the game, so S.A. went
alone. The distance was 2000 miles, through unknown
country, and cartage of rations ran from £24 to £l3O per
ton. About 500 miles at each end were let by contract,
and the Government undertook the intervening 1000
miles. After a while the Port Darwin contract struck
trouble. The Government took over the job in 1872, and
sent Todd north to supervise. He sailed in the Omeo,
which was followed by the Tararua, the two vessels
taking between them 157 horses, plant, and stores. Todd
struck his first trouble at the Roper River, when the
Omeo’s skipper reckoned he’d see the whole caboodle
darned before he’d take his steamer up the stream unless
he was indemnified against loss. The indemnity was
given, and the voyage proceeded without accident. Todd
stayed in the Territory for five months, and then over-
landed to Adelaide, inspecting every post on the way.
On 22nd August, 1872, the wires met near the centre of
Australia, and from that lone spot the Superintendent
spoke to Adelaide and Port Darwin. Todd afterwards
had a hand in the erection of the Adelaide-Westralian line.
His last 30 years or so have been comparatively restful.
AUSTRALIA'S YOUNGEST LEGISLATOR.
BEN WATKINS, Labor M.H.A., elected un-
opposed for Queenstown, Tasmania, Nov. 19,
1906; born, July 26, 1884.
Ben Watkins, the new member of the
Assembly for Queenstown (Tas.), is the youngest
Parliamentarian in Australasia, having passed his
22nd milestone last July. Tom Seddon, who
stepped into his deceased father’s M.L. con-
stituency at 23 or 24, now takes aback seat. Ben
contested South Hobart at the general elections
last March, against Tory Stafford Bird and ex-
Laborite Mac Master, and ran a good second to
the ex-Speaker and ex-Treasurer of the Fly speck.
He has now been elected unopposed to the seat
vacated by Geo. Burns, who is trying to wrest tlie
Denison (Federal) constituency from Philip Fysh.
The new member has earned his daily crust since
his 14th year on Tasmania’s Labor paper, the
Clipper. That publication, by the way, has now
two members of Parliament on its staff ; as editor
“John Drayman ” Woods secured a Labor seat
(North Hobart) at the general elections in March.
A POLITICAL CAREER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Neil James Archibald Primrose, second son of the Earl
of Rosebery, has inherited the sum of £lOO,OOO under the
will of his great-aunt, the late Miss Cohen, of whose town
house he also becomes the owner. The bequest was made
expressly to enable the beneficiary, who will attain his
24th year next month, to follow a political career.
— Cablegram.
Oh, what a thrill of joy we feel
When told of this “ career ” for Neil!
It really seems the worst of shames—
We don’t do more for little James !
To what high “ honors ” is he called,
Aunt Cohen’s nephew, Archibald 1
Of course he’s got the Cohen nose—
And where that hangs the money goes.
Can harm befall the British race
So long as Neil is in his place ?
Can foreigners play harmful games
Against the sacred land of James ?
Is England likely to be mauled
When ruled by little Archibald ?
Ah, no 1 But could such sad things be,
Her foes at Cohen’s name would flee—
And, at the sight of Cohen’s nose,
A panic would possess those foes !
Ten million men as good as he
(But not, alas ! with £ s. d.)
Have no “ career ” at all —but then,
Of course, they are but common men ;
They’ve no Aunt Cohen, though it’s true*
Their best-known “ uncle ” is a Jew.
Their fathers were not “ noble lords”
Who handled Chosen People’s hoards !
So they, of course, must meekly bow
Without complaint or scoff or row,
And, with enthusiasm, cheer
For Neil James Archibald’s “ career” 1
So here’s to Neil, and here’s to James,
And here’s to Archibald—yet Fame’s
A curious thing ; and so I fear
For Neil James Archibald’s “ career ” !

POLITICAL
POINTS
GEORGE’S DRAG-ON.
THE KNIGHT OF THE WOEFUL FIGURE: “ Fair
lady, for your own safety you must name me
your true knight to slay this horrid monster.”
THE LADY: “ Bless my soul , my good man, there
is no need. I have just kicked the stuffing
out of the dragon myself .”
Bruce Smith said at Petersham (N.S.W.)
that the only parts of his electorate in which he
could not obtain support “were Rookwood and
Newington Asylums. They were the only places
he could not convince. The Socialists had, how-
ever, succeeded where he had failed. (Laughter.)”
That is just where the analogy between Socialism
and Christianity comes in. Anti-Sosh might do
for the well-to-do, but the broken-hearted, the
weary, and distressed would have none of it. So
it was in the days when Christianity appeared in
Rome. The patrician and the rich slave-owner
and Nero Smith—no, just plain Nero—the
emperor, didn’t want it, but the slave, the down-
trodden, and the man without hope in this life
embraced it eagerly. It brought them comfort.
And Spruce Myth boasts in effect that there is no
hope in his doctrine, and that it is only acceptable
to the man and woman who have plenty of the
good things of this life.
N.S.W. State Premier Carruthers saj 7 s he
will have a surplus of £2,000,000 this year. Is this
the point at which Joe stops borrowing, or will
the same old Joe go on floating the same old loan
just the same?
Who says that no graduated land-tax is
wanted in N.S.W. ? On the Upper Richmond
-Kiver dairy farmers, unable to either buy land or
pay the exorbitant rents demanded, are accepting
places on the shares system for a return of 6s. Bd.
in the £, while the owner annexes 13s. 4d.
The only way that the tenant can exist in such
circumstances is by child-slavery.
Thus Willie-Motor Kelly, t’other day,
from the affluent altitude his pa won and placed
him in :
I see men. . . professional polit'cians, for whose peculiar
abilities life offers no better prizes than the salary and
sueli perquisites as the professional politician can cap-
ture.
Surely, surely he isn’t thus referring to his poli-
tical deputy-boss, ex-miner Joe Cook !
Men who can judge in S.A., say that the
successful Senators at the coming elections wiil
be Story (Labor), Plavford (Ministerial), and
Symon (Opposition). The two first are Protec-
tionists, and the latter describes himself as a
‘‘new” Protectionist. It is expected that
Speaker Holder and Paddy Glynn will beat their
Labor opponents.
England is just beginning to bump per-
sonally against the Chinese problem, having sud-
denly discovered that there are 70 yellow laundries
and 2000 Ah Fats in Liverpool alone. Home
Secretary Gladstone is said to be “ puzzled ” how
to deal with them—which is quite likely. Yet
even a very ordinary cook would be able to tell
Herbert Gladstone that the best way to prevent
cockroaches in the soup is to put the cover on the
pot and keep them out.
Chanter, candidate for the Riverina
(N.S.W.), deserves a big “sympathy vote” to
help swell his majority against Anti-Sosh. For
Chanter has had hard luck in polities. Always a
straight-goer, he was faced last election by
squatter opposition, which won the seat by
means that couldn’t stand after investigation,
and Chanter won back the constituency on
a fair go. In the meanwhile, however, he had
lost the post of Chairman of Committees, and had
incurred a double lot of election expenses. During
the difficult times of the last two sessions
Chanter’s vote was always in the right r’.ace, and
his views now are straight Australian The
electors should give him this time a majority,
which will ensure him a waik-over for the future.
Reid’s Anti-Sosh gambols round the
country were brought to a sudden stop by an un-
favorable report
from the can-
vassers who
were testing
the feeling in
East Sydney.
The old district
was, on the
whole, they
thought, safe.
But when the
rearrangement
was made a
large portion of
Paddington was
tacked on to
East Sydney,
and it was dis-
covered to be a
hot-bed of what
Reid calls Sosh.
»o the ex-J-
Premier came
back to town in
a hurry and
proceeded to
attack the Pad-
dington end.
He expected to
be heckled, but
he was listened
to with cour-
teous attention,
in spite of the
fact that the
night was
stormy. At the
con cl usion a
number of
questions were
put and George
was asked to
reconcile his
figures with
those of Cogh-
lan and the “Year Book of Australia.” This
was something new to Greid, and he lost his
head. Pulling a shilling from his pocket he
threw it to the questioner with the request to
take himself off to his natural haunt at the pub.
Then the crowd jeered and the meeting came to
a stormy end.
Thus Melbourne Argus :
Flinders ought to feel itself honored in having the
opportunity of sending a man of Mr. Irvine’s standing and
achievements to the House of Representative*.
Irvine nosed round among a good many constitu-
encies before he decided which one he had the
best chance of “honoring.” As for Flinders, an
electorate which has returned Gibb would pro-
bably feel honored by anything.
Joseph Cook went up to Brisbane lately
with this narrative hanging out of his mouth :
Had the Federal Government been careful, they could
have established old-age pensions out of surpluses, which
at present were being squandered.
Now where are these surpluses, and who is squan-
dering them ? The posts and telegraphs just
about pay their way; they do better under
Federal than they did under State management,
but they just about pay their way. Apart from
them the Commonwealth has about £8,800,000
revenue. It must return £6,600,000 to the States—
it really returns over £7,000,000. Defence and
naval contribution to Britain cost about £700,000;
expense of collecting Customs and Excise about
£250,000 ; all other services about £BOO,OOO. Cook
alleges that, out of the £2,200,000 which is all the
Australian Government can reckon on, it could,
but for its reckless extravagance, pay £1,500,U00
for old age pensions, as well as £700,000 for defence,
and the cost of government as well. It is a pity
that Cook’s friend Reid didn’t perform this marvel
when he was in office.
Some of the Labor Leagues in Maoriland
have ideas. In 1905 Maoriland imported £579,948
worth ot paper and stationery, and at a recent
debate at Palmerston North a Labor speaker
stated that the sawmills of the North Island
threw away and burned enough sawdust and
make all the
the State
idea was that
start apaper-
by using up
the half-
country,
for a
waste timber to
paper required in
twice over. His
the State might
mill or two, and
this waste keep
million in the
and make work
lot of people.
A PUZZLER.
In Mr. Reid’s opinion, the man who finds it too much
trouble to leave his business to record his vote on polling
day is unworthy of the privileges of the franchise.
L.B. : “ And what about the man who is elected
the leader of a party and neglects his country
for his own private interests! ”
Archbishop Clarke told the Church Con-
gress that he found he could have his shovel-hats
made in Melbourne of quite as good quality as
any shovel-hat made in London, and at a smaller
price. Now it is up to the Arch, to admit that
not only can we turn out hats for bishops but we
can raise bishops for hats.
In Victoria, Anti-Sosli’s new horror—in-
vented especially for the farmers —is that, when
the Labor party arrives, clerks in Melbourne will
be supreme. In that case, it seems to be a choice
between the clerks and the Clarkes. And the
clerks, anyhow, will give the farmers room td live.
They, at least, won’t collar all the best land and
use it for sheep-runs.
The N.S.W. Lands cases drag along with
leaden feet. So far the result is as follows:
Hoskins and M‘Nair, after being remanded off
and on for about 18 months, were acquitted.
Charles Bath, after hanging the long ends of his
walrus moustache in the soup of accusation for
quite a while, has been acquitted. Willis, who
was persuaded to return to Australia after many
months of a catch-as-catch-can struggle with South
African law. is where he was, the jury having
disagreed. Crick, after pervading the lower and
upper courts with his robust presence for a long
time, is where he was, the jury having disagreed.
Peter Close —Peter the Rooster, who crowed
accusingly at Crick —is still ready to crow if
wanted. The new Lands Bill, which was to make
all scandals impossible for the future, has been
abandoned and the Lands Department is where it
was. The Attorney-General, at time of writing,
hadn’t said what he would do next, and the im-
provement leases are on the old spot.
Ten years ago, when Victoria introduced
the Wages Board system, which then represented
the high-water mark
of the world’s in-
dustrial legislation,
the number of em-
ployees in Victorian
factories were
47,646. The figure
now is 80,235. The
Tory of ten years
ago declared that
the Wages Board
system would burst
up all industry, and
make Victoria a
wilderness, and, in-
stead, the manufac-
turing industry, which
had been stationary for
ten years, started to
improve quite a lot. The
Tory person is just the same
kind of lying prophet when he
utters the same kind of prophecy about
the graduated land-tax and the proposed
new Federal tariff and other reforms to-day.
Every prophet is to be judged by his past, and
the past of the Tory is worse than awful; he
hasn’t struck the bull’s eye of prophecy once.
“ F.C.” : As far as Victorian Laborites go,
the occurrence of Cold Country Labor leaders
seems to have been singularly unfortunate. First,
little Ben Tillett transpired, and retired without
making any lasting impression. Next, the disas-
trous Tom Mann planted his large hoofs on the
movement, with crushing effect. Now, Ramsay
Macdonald makes a mess of things. Macdonald
has barely warmed his first seat in the Commons ;
he is merely one of a job lot of nearly 700 mem-
bers ; yet he talks to Deakin—twice Prime
Minister, and Commonwealth and State Minister
for many years—as though Deakin were the
novice and he (Macdonald) the master. It is
safe to say this pawky Scotchman will return
’Ome little wiser than when he set out. The best
of them don’t seem to be able to forget that these
are “ the kawlinies.”
This was one of the S.M. Herald’s loud
scare-headings over the case of the Chinese pas-
sengers by the Australian -
THE SHIPWRECKED CHINESE.
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES BACK DOWN.
AT FIRST DEMAND GUARANTEE BONDS.
THEN UNCONDITIONALLY SURRENDER.
And then the article went on to show that no
“guarantee bonds” had ever been even men-
tioned. The agents were asked if they would
“undertake” that the Chinese, many of whom
were from Maoriland, would not remain in Aus-
tralia if landed, but apparently all that was asked
was a general promise. The “ guarantee bonds ”
only existed in the Herald’s imagination.
S.M. Herald balances the political drivel
against State interference in its leader columns
by clamoring for State Socialism in the page
headed “On the Land.’’ Here is a late sample :
The rabbit export trade furnishes another very con-
vincing example. It is safe to say that but for Govern-
ment grading and supervision in this business, it would
never have developed into anything better than a veri’
small trade, with a very bad name.
Apparently the Herald realises that it is no use
talking Private Enterprise to the fanner, so it
holds out to him the hairy paw of Esau while
Jacob is busy writing the leading article.
The Sydney morning papers have had a
vision about an alleged scheme of the Democrats
to boycott tradespeople who don’t vote their
ticket. Surely this must be a delusion ! These
papers are probably thinking of their own threat
of a few years ago to boycott newsagents who
sold a projected democratic morning paper. That
threat was made openly and brazenly, by circular,
and the Telegraph had the effrontery to describe
these newsagents as part of a great organisation IT
had built up for the circulation of its paper, and
which organisation IT declined to allow any inter-
fering new rival to use. If any agent did deal in
a new journal, he was to lose the Telegraph’s
connection. Yet the agents had fitted up their
own shops, and made their own businesses, and
had received no aid from the ’Graph in doing it,
and the ’Graph had no more right to dictate to
them what other goods they should sell than it
has to dictate to Mark Foy what chiffons he shall
deal in. And papers like that have the front to
talk of boycotting 1
About Senator Gould’s statement:—
The Commonwealth had no power, nor was such a
thing ever contemplated, of imposing a tax for the pur-
pose of bursting up big estates, and such a proposal was
a barefaced attempt to interfere with the State rights
and the State prerogative.— Senator Gould, of N.S.W.,
as reported in Sydney ’Graph.
The Bulletin has asked Mr. Gould for quite a
number of weeks to produce the clause of the
Constitution which declares that the Common-
wealth has no power to levy a graduated land-
tax. Being quite unable to extract an answer, it
now takes the liberty of assuming : (1) That Mr.
Gould can’t find any such clause; (2) that his
statement was gross misrepresentation ; (3) that
he has backed down ; (4) that he is a failure ; (5)
that he hasn’t thecourageof his alleged opinions ;
(6) that he isn’t coming to the scratch ; (7) that
the less notice the public takes of Mr. Gould on
December 12 the better.
THE AWAKENING; OR J. BULKS
LAUNDRY.
LOXDON, Friday, 3 p.m.—An investigation that has just
been held into the importation to Liverpool of a score
of Chinamen resulted in the discovery that there are
no fewer than 70 Chinese laundries in the city and its
suburbs. Altogether there are 2000 Chinese in Liverpool.
Irvine, says Melbourne Argus, is “ one of
those politicians whose best qualities are de-
veloped only in office.” In other words, he wants
office so badly that when he doesn’t get it he
develops his worst qualities. At least, that’s how
the Argus would have put it if it had been talk-
ing about Lyne.
At no time, perhaps, than during the hot
summer months, is Scrubb’s world-famous Cloudy
Ammonia more welcome as an adjunct to the toilet. It
is invigorating, cooling, and refreshing to a remarkable
degree when added to the bath, while a few drops soften
the toilet water, and impart a delightful freshness to the
face and hands. As a purely household accessory, too
(as most people are aware), its claims are manifold, for
there are few uses to which it cannot be turned._ It
whitens and rapidly cleanses linen of all kinds, is of
material assistance in the cleaning of marble, glass, plate,
and china, and, in addition, is highly recommended as an
important addition to shampoo washes for the hair.*

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Sydney Prince Alfred Yacht Club sailed the
first of its three championship races of the year on Satur-
day. It started with a drift, varied by occasional cat’s
paws which were barely sufficient to keep the yachts
moving- against the flood tide. Then a faint nor’-easter
breathed on the face of the waters, and Mr. Saxton’s
Magic caught it first and started away to Chowder in the
van. In Manly Cove the Magic showed an excellent
b t of seamanship, and gained water thereby. At
Shark Island and Fort Denison it was still leading,
and after that nothing else had a hope. Magic
won by Bmin. 43see. from Scotia, which beat Cul-
wulla by lmin. 37sec. Six started in the Cruisers’
Handicap, and after the wind came there was a pretty
race between Athene, Bui Bui, and Fairlie along the
eastern shore; all three being on the 15-minute allow-
ance. Herreshoff was the scratch boat, and had brought
along a huge jackvard topsail, with a view to raking up
all the atmosphere there was. It was an excellent idea,
and at Manly Duval had wiped out a couple of com-
petitors. At Shark Island he had moved up to second
place, with Bui Bui only 65sec. ahead. At the fort they
were abreast. Passing Shark Island the second time
Herreshoff was leading by over a minute, and at the finish
was nearly two minutes to the good, with Bui Bui second,
and Athene lmin. 56sec. behind.

Saturday’s open-boat affair was merely a repe-
tition of the struggle between Chris. Webb and George
Holmes in the Australian and Donnelly. While they
watched one another they took no heed of Vision, which
C. Abbot has got trained up to the moment, so to speak,
and that craft got to the front and stayed there. The
handicapping badly war 1 -" shaking up, for every .Satur-
day afternoon see- the re*, struggle lie between the same
old four. The other -8 or 10 boats ought to have a look
in occasionally, or e.' -f re should be a subdivision, or
something. Vision won, with Australian second, Don-
nelly third, and Scot fourth. Open-boat racing in
Sydney harbor grows monotonous.
*•* » *
Another round of Sydney First Grade cricket
concluded on Saturday last and left Gordon at the head of
thelist with nine competition points. Paddington and Bur-
wood share second place with five points each. Then come
Waverley with four and North Sydney with one. After
that they are mostly something worse than nothing. The
round was chiefly remarkable for the three crushing-
defeats of clubs i hat have in their time kicked up con-
siderable dust. On the previous Saturday Burwood smote
together 270, and dismissed Redfern for a miserable 45,
and then it w’ent home with the satisfied feeling that
follows a good day’s work. On Saturday Redfern again
tried its luck at the sticks, but Burwood bowler Garnsey
took five for 51, and though Kerim and Nicholls made a
slight stand the innings ended for 138, leaving Burwood
victors by an innings and 87 runs. This disgraceful
licking was just about equalled by that which Middle
Harbor endured at the hands of Paddington. Middle
Harbor’s first innings yielded 100. Paddington
responded with 254, of which Trumper and Noble
made 38 and 56 respectively, and W. R. Iredale
38. Sundries also scored well, totalling 26. It was
bowler Oollins who wrecked Middle’s second innings.
He took six for 23, and Winning got the other four for
28 (Noble got none for 17). The side was out for 68,
leaving Paddington boss of the ground by an innings
and 86 runs. The third of these fearsome debacles was
that of Central Cumberland, which fell before Gordon.
Gordon responded to Cumberland’s 199 by closing the
innings with six wickets down for 304, and the Gordon
bowlers did the rest. Macartney took five for 22,
Pitt knocked down the other four for 38, and the remain-
ing man was run out—total score, 72. So Gordon went
home winners by an innings and 33 runs.

Saturday was a horrible day for cricket, or for
anything except a Turkish bath and a rub down. It was
insufferably humid, with leaden-tinted clouds hovering
near, occasionally spilling rain, and a weak, decrepit
breeze staggering along in a series of gaspy puffs.
The desolate atmosphere and the dim light took the
soul out of the batsmen, and poor scores were the
order of the day. Cotter, of Glebe, topped the list with
86, and was caught by Hopkins off White. Next came
Quist, of Sydney, who was caught by Bentley off Sullivan
for 73. Whitting, of Balmain, was run out for 71. After
these, the scores tailed off rapidly to single figures and
eggs.

Ex-Queensland cricketer Alan Marshal, who
played a few times for Paddington in Sydney first-grade
cricket, made five records for his London County Club
during the late English season greatest aggregate,
highest individual score, most centuries, most wickets
captured, and most catches. In batting his figures were
53 innings ; six times not out ; 3578 runs ; highest score,
300 not out; average, 76T2. He made 12 centu ies, four
of which exceeded the double hundred. He bowled 741 T
overs, 134 of which were maidens, taking 167 wickets for
2355 runs ; average, 14T0. Apart from London County
cricket, he made 772 runs, including two centuries, and
took 43 wickets.

London Truth has taken a vote of its readers
as to the best XI. available for England at the close of
its cricket season. It resulted in the following order :
Hirst, Hayward, Tyldesley, Hutchings, Fielder, Lilley,
Burnup, Haigh, Rhodes, Knox, and Arnold (with Jack-
son close up 12th). Warner and A. O. Jones were also
often named, generally for the position of captain. Ten
of the voters named 10 of the above 11, but nobody named
that exact team, which is not surprising, seeing that
there is no room for Fielder, Knox, and Haigh, all fast
bowlers, in one XI. C. B. Fry was dead lame, and out of
the running, when the vote was taken, and Ranjitsinjhi
was away in India. All the picked, except Hutchings
and Knox, are old stagers, and all except those two and
Haigh have visited Australia.

Girl cricketers are fast taking possession of all
the spare patches on the suburban reserves about Mel-
bourne. At Albert Park they practise side by side with
the junior players of the trousered sex, and the spectacle
is now such an ordinary one that it seldom provokes any
comment. At first the male smiters tumbled over one
another in their eagerness to carry out half-lengths of
matting for the feminine players, but the novelty soon
wore off, and the girls now hump their own furniture.
Wagner —not the musician, but the fellow who
drove the winning car in the Vanderbilt Cup race —is
said to have made over £2400 by side wagers on the great
contest. This race .will live in history as the one at
which the fool spectators rushed on to the course to get
a good view of the finish, and were driven over. The
Automobile Club was attacked in the press for not erect-
ing proper barricades to keep the lunatics back, and the
officials took it so much to heart that they induced the
club to undertake the building of a proper autodrome in
time for next year’s race. This track is to be 20 or 30
miles to the lap, and will be situated in private ground,
somewhere within 100 miles of New York city. The de-
signers have taken special care to arrange for hills,
corners, and long straight stretches, so that the whizzer
will have every possible variety of ways Of breaking his
neck.
Maoriland has started out to severely dis-
courage the bookmaker. Hitherto, when warned off the
course, the bookmakers declined to go, and went on lay-
ing the odds. Afterwards, when hauled before the court,
they pleaded not guilty, and paid their fines cheerfully
when the cases went against them ; and duly put in an
appearance at next meeting. Now the courts have got
tired, and at Christchurch lately, when a number of books
were hauled up, no less than three volumes were sent to
gaol for two months each. Other publications who had
not such long records were fined large, amounts, and told
that their next appearance before the court would be
rewarded with a slice of jug. Bookmaking on the course
is a dead game in Maoriland now.

A small country racing club in S.A. has had to
stand a lawsuit through reviving the cruel old custom of
racing in “heats” (which simply means running the
same horses over the same track again and again till one
of them clearly outstays the others). This throw-back
to ancient custom was announced on posters, but not on
the official programme ; so in the Maiden Hack Race the
winner of the first go claimed that the race was all over,
and that the stake was his. He got a verdict, too. The
club fiercely urged that it should be allowed to take the
case on to the Supreme Court, but the lower tribunal
said it wasn’t worth it. The amount of the stake fought
for was £2 10s. !

After all, the Victorian police managed to
arrest Hill, the man wanted over the Blue Jacket case
last August, when a few undeserving tote shops were had
for small amounts by means of a bogus telegram. The
police believed that Mill had fled to Africa with the 2d. or
so that was made out of the paltry alleged swindle, but,
on spec., a detective was ordered to watch the premises
pf Hill’s mother. When all hope was given up, nobody
remembered to cancel the order, and the ’tec. remained
outside the house, like a dog' on his master’s grave, or the
horse that is tied up to the pub, while his owner tells
lies over his beer inside. And, the other day, Hill came
out of Collingwood, where he is alleged to have been
hiding for three months, all on account, of that wretched
2d. or so, and the tec. enveloped him. He has been com-
mitted for trial. At the preliminary hearing some curious
evidence was given. To work the scheme an accomplice
was wanted in the telegraph office. First, it is said,
Fletcher was approached. Fletcher shook his head hard.
The matter was laid before Monaghan, but Monaghan de-
clined with bitterness. Next, Brown was insidiously
asked to join. Brown reckoned he would see the appli-
cant blowed first. Then Lobb, who was “ religiously
inclined,” was tried, and Lobb is said to have rushed the
offer. There is no mention of Fletcher, Monaghan or
Brown being “ religiously inclined.”

One good result of the new N.S. Wales Gaming
Act has been the closing of whole row's of Chow shops
around the Ilaymarket. Most of them were labelled
“grocery,” “boarding-house,” “cookshop”; but that
there’s nothing in a name is hinted at by the fact that
one alleged Chinese club had its “members only”
shingle printed ih English ! If it had been printed in
Chow it might have scared away the Chow who wasn’t
a member and so spoiled business. Being in English, it
was interesting reading for the policeman.

The coursing brotherhood in N.S.W. is already
agitating for an amendment of the anti-gambling law, so
that betting may be allowed at meetings where two great
bounding streaks of dog run a hare to death in a closely-
enclosed paddock. Otherwise, they say, the pursuit of
one short animal by two long ones w'ill be a lost amuse-
ment. It was always a lost sport, like pigeon-butchery,
and the sooner it is legally damned and done for the
better. Of course, the usual dubiously clean hand holds
out the usual plea that the wretched proceeding “improves
the breed of dogs.” Weil, the breed of dogs that coursing
encourages can die out without much harm to the com-
munity; it’s a long, spindle-shanked breed, useless for
real hunting since it will only follow game that it can see
and will not pursue by scent, and has no courage at all.
The best that can be said for coursing is that it improves
the breed of a dog that is only of use for coursing-, just as
horse-racing helps the production of a kind of horse that is
good only for horse-racing. Both sports also encourage a
darned poor breed of men ; while pigeon-shooting pro-
duces the curious upright hog that is neither wholly man,
nor quite pork.

Melbourne Bicycle Club’s attempt to revive the
departed glories of the Austral Wheel Race fizzled out
badly on the first night of the meeting. To attract the
“ toffv ” crowd that used to adorn the M.O. Ground, the
club had arranged an adaptation of an alleged Japanese
military spectacle—Takahari Chochin Gyoretsu—which
was promised as a dazzling and glorious memory ; a great
array of military wheelmen, on machines beautifully
illuminated, coming on in the darkness amid surroundings
of oriental gorgeousness, and going through thrilling and
weird evolutions, etc. The blessed Takahari boiled
down to a series of simple evolutions by bike-mounted
teams from the defence forces, said teams carrying Chinese
lanterns, green and red flares, &c. The dazzle and gorge
of the spectacle was grievously absent. Such a scene
would be well worth viewing if carried out on the Lang-
warrin plain by mounted men with lanterns or flares, but
the baby evolutions of bikists on a half-acre of ground
merely provoked the crowd to scorn. The Australian
can ride a bike or a goat as successfully as Greid
rides a rail, but he is most at home on a horse, and the
2000 crowd that doubled itself at 9 p.m. in order to view
the spectacle presently departed in disgust. Eight military
teams were to have evoluted in the competition, but
by the time four had done so it was so late and the spec-
tators so few chat the other four postponed operations
sine die. Nothing brilliant transpired about the racing.
The heats and finals of the Bagot (scratch) mile and the
M.B.C. Plate were run off, B. P. Kett beating Bestel and
F. Murphy in the former, and Hehir winning the latter
from H. B. Smith and Quinlan. The Teams Race was an
interesting novelty, three teams of three men each being
handicapped for each of the four heats. The members of
each team, of course, paced each other, and, as the
winner carried his mates with him, there was an unaccus-
tomed unselfishness about the affair.

Gus Rennert, the burly German who has chal-
lenged Clarence Weber to wrestle for the Australian
Championship, has been referred to as “the wrestler who
came out with Hackensclimidt.” Rennert didn’t come
out with Hack. He came to Australia on his own—from
German New Guinea, or some German colony close at
hand —and lived for a time at Balmain (Sydney). He was
one of Carkeek’s faked spontaneous challengers all over
Australia, and afterwards filled the same role with Hack.
Then Hack, took him to England, where he used to chal-
lenge as “the London wrestler,” and put up thrilling
goes with the Russian. He put on three stone of muscle
and learnt a lot. Once he wrestled 15 minutes “ fair
dinkum ” with Madrali, the Horrible Turk. He is in
Australia for a short while, and will probably go on to the
States to meet Hack, again as the spontaneous challenger.
He will certainly do so if he can take away with him
Weber’s scalp and the Australian Championship.

The recent epidemic of heart-failure has caused
something like a scare in Maoriland, and people of an in-
vestigating turn of mind have dug out the fact that most
of the victims are old-time athletes who trained their
muscles at the expense of their hearts. As a result, the
organ they overtaxed in the days of their youth sud-
denly went back on them in mature life, with the usual
lamentable results. In the face of this discovery, the
fact that some of the schools have been training their
pupils for eight and 16 mile races is being severely com-
mented upon. Athletics are good, but too much of the
good thing is sometimes fatal.

After his experience at Brennan’s Amphi-
theatre, Sydney, on Tuesday of last week, Peter Felix
ought to realise that he has no chance of winning a fight
in Sydney' on points unless he can bleach his skin white
and call himself by another name. He is a pretty boxer,
he fights a fair, gentlemanly scrap, and gives his oppo"
nent a lot more consideration than is either wise or busi-
ness-like ; and .vet, withal, he doesn’t get fair play. In
fact, his treatment last Tuesday night week was dis-
graceful. It was a savage fight, and the veriest novice
could see that Murphy- was hunting desperately for a
foul. Unless he could find that bird, he was a beaten
man. By the grace of referee Mr. Harry Beckett he
got the foul, and the fact that he did so is an
indelible stain on Mr. Beckett’s reputation as a
referee. Twice before, when Felix had beaten Murphy to
the rope, and was banging him heavily while the white
man layback across it, the referee called Felix off—which
he had no right to do. Murphy’s feet were on the ground,
and Felix had the right to bang him for all he was worth.
He could have knocked Murphy right out then, but
seemed to hesitate to give the coup de grace to a man
apparently quite helpless. Had the positions been
reversed that great right-hand swing of Murphy’s would
have crashed down on throat or jaw and sent Felix to
sleep for a week. The curious point about it was that
the referee didn’t give Murphy the foul when Felix
struck him across the ropes on the first and second occa-
sions, yet the thing that was lawful on two occasions
was illegal on the third.
THE SILLIEST SHOW ON EARTH.
Frank Thorne, the Westralian featherweight
who visited Sydney a few months back, and heat every-
thing that was pitted against him, and departed with
the championship of his class, met with a reverse at the
nimble hands of young- Bob Greenshields at the Olympic
Club’s Coliseum, Melbourne, the other night. Thorne
came east to meet an old foe, and one he had already
defeated on his own stamping ground, but Greenshield B
had picked up mqch knowledge in the meantime, and
had had many victories to put the winning spirit into
him. Thorne is a rushing, worrying fighter, but Green-
shieldsisbard and clever, and just themanto take the best
advantage of worrying tactics. Frank had him down for
eight seconds in the first round, but Bob soon hammered
some of the dash out of the champion, and as his boxing
was very decidedly superior to Thorne’s, he piled up
points through the eventful rounds that followed, and
was easily a winner at the finish. There were moments
when it seemed that Thorne was not actuated by the
wildest desire to win, but he took a lot of collision, and
his fighting in the 19th round was evidently in dead
earnest. At the conclusion, Wren offered to back Thorne
against Greenshields for £soo—a mad offer on the night’s
showing, and presuming there was no fish in the atmos-
phere.

Seems that champion pug Jim Jeffries has
found farming a losing game. His ignorance of the
business, coupled with the extortions of the Private
Enterprise railroad combine, made it an expensive
failure, and it is said that there is a ghastly gap in the
amount which the one-time boiler-maker accumulated
in the ring. To fill the hole the great scrapper will meet
the winner of the next great fight for a 50,000d01. purse.

When Nelson, after being defeated in his fight
with Joe Gans, at Goldfield (U.S.A.), went round the
country telling his bright American lie to the effect that
referee Siler had received thousands of dollars to out him
on an alleged foul or any good or bad excuse whatever,
he quite forgot that the kinematographs had been drink-
ing in the details of the scrap. While he lied the films
were being developed, and in due time they were run off.
When run off at full speed the pictures showed nothing,
but when slowed down to half speed the foul punch stood
out plainly. On the screen Nelson’s left was seen to
execute a low drive which landed on the very spot com-
plained of by Gans at the time of the fight. Now Nelson
is in the soup, for the people are howling for his blood,
and the referee has issued writs against him, claiming
heavy damages for defamation of character, and other
things.

O’Brien, who funked on the Squires match, is
back in the States, having wiped the floor with the soft
marks he w'ent across to England to meet, and he finds
that in his own land his name has a tendency to become
Mud. He proposes to alter all this by belting stars out
of Sammy Berger, who nearly beat him a little while ago.
His friends explain that it is part of O’Brien’s “ method ”
to allow any new man he may meet to make a con-
siderable impression the first time ; that he holds his end
of the stick up fairly well at the second meeting; and
that he makes it a rule to utterly demolish his foe at the
third meeting, when public interest has been worked up.
It sounds very nice. The only trouble is that Berger,
the Jew, may make it his fixed and inviolable rule to
knock out his opponent for good at the second encounter.
* * * *
“ Philo ” : Mention of Sam Berger in a recent
Bulletin, as a fighter who punched O’Brien to a stand-
still, reminds me of another Hebrew, A 1 Kaufmann, who
is considered to have a chance for the world’s champion-
ship. In fact, O’Brien’s possession of the title is not at
all certain. He has three formidable opponents in Berger,
Kaufmann, and Tommy Burns, and it is widely predicted
in Uncle Sam’s sporting circles that Berger will be the
future proprietor of the title. This reminds me that the
Jews seem to be getting the fighting business largely into
their own hands in America, where there are more top-
notchers of the Hebrew race than of any other. Besides
the two aspirants for the heavyweight championship, there
are a couple who threaten to take the lightweight cham-
pionship back to Palestine. Then the featherweight
champion is a Jew named Abe Attell (who is considered to
be the cleverest man at the game in the world); and the
amateur feather-weight and 1051 b. championships belong
to Moses and Aaron. Altogether, the seed of dispersed
Abraham are getting a corner on the American fighting
business, and if the Gentiles don’t do something
prompt they will be left. The fighters of Israel have won
their way to the top in spite of being handicapped by
large quantities of surplus nose, and that is a serious
drawback for a fighter.
One Pitt (evidently Bottomless) writes to
the Herald asking W. M. Hughes to tell him
thenumberof adults
who, on account of
the Socialistic ten-
dency of our legis-
lation, have found
it expedient to “get
off the land ” ; the
number who prefer
their present occu-
pations to the trials
and hardships of
being on the land ;
the number who
have no desire to go
on the land ; and,
finally, the num-
ber who, having
honestly tried, have
failed in their en-
deavors to secure
land. Pitt asserts
that if these queries
be answered truth-
fully, it will be
found that there is
no land monopoly.
It is a pity Hole
didn’t wade in and
answer his own questions truthfully, and thus
prove his case. Orifice professes to believe that
the figures can be found ; and, if so, Gap should
find them. The failure of Cavity to do so is just
what might be expected of Chasm.
Died this week in the mountains above
Sydney, “Sam” Allen, for years past the too-
energetic head of the big North Queensland firm
of Samuel Allen and Sons (he was the oldest of
the sons) —a “white” man who spent his life in
building up a business, and wrecked himself in
the process.
THE REASON WHY!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Why is it that in this vast unpeopled continent, full of
boundless resources for human prosperity and happiness,
enterprise is so sluggish, and so many millions of Austra -
lian money that might be emploj’ing thousands of men
in Australian enterprises, are left in London as a better
field of investment ? — Excerpt from G. 11. Redd’s ‘ Letter
to the Electors," published in Sydney Daily Telegraph.
Now, do you ask this question, George,
In sober earnest, seriously ?
Wilt list to a suggestion, George,
Not purposed deleteriously ?
Why is the gold exported. George ?
Why js it (inter, alia)
To Germany escorted, George,
And not kept in Australia?
Because our enterprises, George,
Lack surety and security,
And Foreign-trade despises, George,
Australia’s futurity!
Because we want Protection, George !
A statesman to determine he
Won’t spread ALL his affection, George,
On your beloved Germany !

W. T. GOODGR
A FINE OLD PIONEER PREACHER.
The dwellers of the bush and small townships
of Australia have often been regarded as a god-
less race, and of recenty ears greater efforts have
been made for the propaganda of the Gospel
through the agency of associations. The in-
creased facilities of travelling by the extension
of railways and better means of communication,
have vastly assisted m reaching those parts which
50 years ago were almost without religious
teaching. Among the pioneers of over half-a-
eentury ago is one who still remains an energetic
worker and ministers to six congregations ex-
tending over a radius of 42 miles in a scattered
district of Victoria. He is the veteran Rev.
Thomas Beecher Swift, of Alexandra (Vic.), who
for over 55 years has labored in the vineyard of
his Master. It is to such men as this that the
Scots Church owe their proud position in Aus-
tralia at the present day. On October 13th,
1905, he celebrated his 84th birthday and re-
ceived congratulations from all parts of the
Commonwealth. At this green old age he still
retains his strength and vitality and enjoys
splendid health which he attributes to total
abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, and to the
occasional use of a well-known household remedy.
“I have been a preacher of the Gospel for 52
years,” he writes on May 19th, 1902, “and am
now in my 81st year. I suffered for a long time
from costiveness and consequent indigestion.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills were brought
under my notice some two years ago. I took one
pill every evening, and soon under that method
my costiveness and indigestion were relieved.
They assist nature in the discharge of all her
functions, increase the appetite, produce sound
sleep, and give elasticity of spirits. I always
preach three times on Sundays, and drive long
distances to my appointments. I enjoy life and
the Lord’s work to which He called me more than
50 years ago.”
Three years later he writes to us again as
follows:—“Referring to my previous letter, I
can still endorse the merits of your remedy. I
was suffering from constipation and indigestion
for many years. I tried many remedies but they
all lost their effect. But with Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills they are as efficacious now in
assisting nature as they were four years ago. I
cannot do without them, and one pill every night
assures me to be right for the next morning.
Although I am in my 84th year, every fourth
Sunday I drive 38 miles, and on other Sundays,
25 miles to fulfil my appointments and conduct
three services every Sunday. My health was
never better, thanks to Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills; my life never brighter, my days never
happier, and God’s work under my care never
more prosperous than at present. I am sending
you my photograph, and am indeed glad to be
able to state that Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
still maintain their standard of excellence and
efficiency.”
Mr. Swift has received many enquiries regard-
ing the above letters and he assures us that he is
only too happy to reply to anyone who may write
him.*

The Tory papers are calling upon the
electors of South Sydney and Hunter electorates
to return Drs. Jimmy Graham and Liddell be-
cause these gentlemen have attended to them and
their children. By the same argument, the
people who have supplied the electors with food
for themselves and their children should also be
returned whenever they feel like going into
Parliament. The Tory argument might have some
weight with people who have not paid the doctors
for their services, but to the man who has paid
his bill it is an insult. There is* no difference
between the gentleman who sells medical know-
ledge and experience and the fellow who sells
bread and • cheese. They both save life—in fact,
the grocer saves our lives every day and the
doctor only occasionally. And the man who has
paid his half-guinea per visit is under no more
obligation to the medical gentleman than the
medical gentleman is to the bloke whom he
remunerated with a bob for 41b. of potatoes.
Jim Hogue, who went to the Castlereagh
(N.S.W.) to deliver addresses in favor of candi-
date Barry and against Labor man Trefle, is, it is
said, to be stabled in Sydney when the next
State contest goes on in the interior, or else he
will be sent out to blight the Opposition candi-
date with his unfortunate support.
Certain Australian employers are raising a
fighting fund to test the constitutionality of the
“union label.” It is hard to see why decent
employers should view the label with grief or
alarm, though the harm it will do to sweaters is
as plain as a terrace of houses. All that the law
provides is that a union or a group of unions may
register a label which, when affixed to goods, will
announce that they were made by union labor.
There is no compulsion on anyone to use the label,
and it should be a very dangerous thing for a
union to have if all—or even half—that the daily
papers say about the public revolt against trade-
union tyranny is true.
A true bill:—
The name of the Melbourne Age should stink in the
nostrils of every Australian Democrat after its decision
to support the candidature of the unspeakable Simian
Phraser for the Senate. Phraser as elected six years
ago, wholly and solely because his name was the
only one which appeared on the tickets of both the
Argos and Age. He did not address a single meeting—a
fact that probably helped his candidature considerably—
but he sent forth dodgers wholesale announcing his
strong Protectionist principles. Then the drought came
along. Simian bad to buy fodder, and this fact, com-
bined with association with Tories of Freetrade pro-
clivities, led to his ratting on Protection and voting in
favor of a “revenue tariff.” He is a traitor to his
alleged principles, a dullard, a political pantaloon (he
doesn’t amount to a clown), an enemy to all pro-
gress, and for these reasons the Argus supports him.
The Age supports him because he and old David S.vme
chew food together daily at the same restaurant. Vic-
toria returned Phraser at the top of the poll six years
ago because he and Synie chewed food together daily at
the same restaurant. But since then it has elected Tren-
with, despite all Syme could do to keep him out. That
should be sufficient of a hint to the old Age man that
things may not be what they were, and that a mere
mutual chewing of food may )>e insufficient recommen-
dation for a legislator.
Thus ‘ ‘ Chibur ” :
Let us sit down for a few minutes and light up and
consider things. Bill has got a new' rifle, one of those
American ones. Joe has a shot g-u'n^or had, up to last
Saturday, when part of it went away suddenly. So did
two of Joe’s fingers. He’s in hospital, and the gun is in
the river, ft was a Belgian gun—cost him 2is. 6d., too.
What a pity—give us a match ! —what a pity it is we
can’t build guns. Now, if we had a gun factory we could
build our rifles for our defence force, and we could also
build ourselves shot guns and sporting rifles which,
possibly, wouldn’t burst and blow off two of Joe’s fingers.
Give us another match ! Thanks. Well, so-long.

FOR AUSTRALIA!
“ VICTORIAN INFLUENCES.”
1 cubing the last few weeks the useless and not
ornamental Wilks, of N.S.W., has been hunting
the shifty and elusive vote around the back alleys
of Balmain with an impossible lie to the effect
that the tariff, which applies equally to all Aus-
tralia, somehow protects Victoria and doesn’t
protect N.S.W. —the poor old Ma State which is
always understood by Wilks and a few others to
be ground down beneath the iron heel of calamity.
This wildly-absurd allegation is supposed to be e vi-
denceof that bogus “ Victorian Conspiracy ” which
—with the alleged Romish conspiracy, and the
alleged conspiracy of the manufacturers against
the agricultural population—is the chief stock-in-
trade of agitators of the inferior Wilks type.
And the pathetic feature of the case is that in
howling “ Victorian conspiracy ” Wilks appeals
io a sentiment which is worth at least a few votes.
The anti-Victorian feeling exists among a section
of Sydneyites—an ancient, purposeless, artificially-
inanufactured grudge which has no counterpart in
any other section of Australia, nor in any part
of N.S.W. outside Sydney and its environs. It
began with Separation, which diminished the
consequence of the high-handed Sydney politicians
of 55 years ago, but that was in itself only a small
grievance. Almost immediately after Separa-
tion, however, came the Victorian gold era, and
for years and years the Mother State—that was
the favorite pose of Sydney politicians even then
—was eclipsed. Victoria, in 1850, just before
Separation, had 76,000 people ; N.S.W. had
190,000. By 1861 Victoria had 540,000 people to
N.S.W.’s 350.000, and the tiny State kept the
lead for 30 years thereafter. Sydney, in 1851, was
times the size of Melbourne, but when the gold
era cametylelbourne overshadowed it so completely
that for a while, to people away in England,
Melbourne was the centre of Australia, and
Sydney only some sort of a bye-product.
* m # *
Amid the rowdy politicians of the old Sydney
days this accidental temporary eclipse was bitterly
resented, and the Sydney press followed their
lead. Old John Robertson was the chief rowdy,
and he used to forget what few manners he ever
had, and expectorate violently when the name of
Victoria was mentioned. The most civil thing he
ever said about it was “Cabbage Garden.” To
the big, loud-mouthed, devil-may-care Parliamen-
tarians of two generations, and to their press
barrackers, a loose, coarse, free-and-easy denunci-
ation of the State which once had the effrontery
to eclipse N.S.W. served to fill in speeches when
nothing else was handy. It turned up in all
manners, of unexpected places. When N.S.W.
invited the other States to join it in forming a
Commonwealth, the large, sprawling men of
the Dibbs type denounced the movement as
a “ Victorian conspiracy.” They were against
Federation, and everything they were against
was “Victorian.” “When the bank crisis came
in 1893,” shouted Dibbs m one of his speeches of
loose vituperation, “all our money went over to
Victoria to keep it afloat, and this shows how
completely dependent they are on US.” It was
pointed out to Dibbs that there was a Customs
record of exports and imports of coin, and that
the record showed that in ’93 Victoria sent more
coin to N.S.W. than it received from that State,
whereupon the large gentleman didn’t retract,
but only foamed generally. Even before the first
Federal Convention met a claim was put in for
Bathurst as a site for a Federal capital, the reason
assigned being that it was “away from Victorian
influences.” It wasn’t considered necessary to
point out that Victorian influences must neces-
sarily be leprous ; it was recognised that, when it
was mentioned that they were Victorian, Sydney
would take the leprosy for granted. Sydney
Telegraph devoted a whole leading article about
the same period to denunciation of the iniquitous
and unbrotherly Victorians who had levied a
heavy duty on N.S.W. coal, and thus grievously
damaged the N.S.W. coal industry ; it made no'
difference to it that there never was any such Vic-
torian duty, that Victoria wasN.S.W.’s best coal
customer, and that the coal industry was highly
prosperous just then. The same Telegraph, which
lives by fostering local grudges and jealousies
and provincialisms, started wild perjuries about
how “Victorian gold” was pouring across the
border to buy votes for Federation in N.S.W.,
and almost in the same breath it alleged that
Victoria had no gold at all, and was such a
deadly poor place that .N.S.W. would have to
support it if Federation came about. A year or
so ago the same Telegraph ran, mostly in its
correspondence columns, a long-continued fiction
about how the other States, principally Victoria,
were robbing N.S.W. of its Federal surplus—this
despite the fact that every month regularly, in
its financial column, it had to record the fact that
N.S.W. received its whole surplus with absolute
regularly.
■K * * *
And even to this day every N.S.W. member
who doesn’t believe in suppressing N. S. W.
manufactures for the benefit of the foreign
importer is described off-hand in the Sydney
importing press as a person who has fallen under
“Victorian influences,” and is therefore despic-
able, and this description is cheerfully applied
even to veterans like Lyne, who were Protec-
tionists for half an ordinary lifetime before Federa-
tion brought them into contact with Victoria.
When the first Governor-General came out—
a very tired, sick man who badly wanted to get
ashore and have done with the heaving sea—there
was a deluge of official correspondence from
Sydney to the effect that he must come all the way
round to that port by water, because it would be
an insult to Sydney if he finished his journey by
rail, and thus touched the polluted territory of
S. Australia or Victoria before he reached the
N.S.W. capital. Now, on top of these and a
multitude of other silly outcries, arises the bright
new lie that, in some way or other, the tariff,
which applies to all Australia alike, protects
"Victoria and doesn’t protect N.S.W.; and the
Anti-Socialist party, which lives on hatreds—anti-
Victorian hatred, anti-R.C. hatred, hatred of
Australian industry, and Stinking Fish hatred of
Australia in general—is making all possible use of
this lie. The anti-Victorian cry is a curious obses-
sion, handed down from the middle of last
century, and it seems to keep going in and around
Sydney long after its origin is forgotten by the
multitude. And the obsession has its uses.
Whoever rallies up an anti-Victorian party, or an
anti-Australian party, or an anti-Australian Indus-
try party, or an anti-Land Settlement party, or
an anti-GoD party, at least gets his reward in the
shape of that party’s vote.
The Perfidy of Syme.
“ Pol.” is angry with a newspaper :
That alleged Liberal organ, the Melbourne Age, owned
and directed by that alleged patriot, David Syme, has
performed some strange somersaulting over the Victorian
Senate elections. As the result, manufacturer Ciiakles
Atkins is now left with a grievance as long and as heavy
as a telegraph pole. When the sinuous Foreign-tiade
tactics of G. Reid and his party became apparent,
Atkins, who is one of the strongest of the Chamber
of Manufactures’ men, and one of the most per-
sistent supporters of Australian industry, appeared
as a Senate candidate. Apparently he did it on
some sort of understanding with David, for David’s
leading articles patted him on the back and bade
him go forth and conquer. Atkins went forth, and spent
much energy and some money in the going. The
treacherous Syme, whose name should be Slyme, allowed
nomination-day to arrive, and Atkins, who has been
selected by the Dkakin Government as its candidate,
duly nominated. On the first newspaper day thereafter,
David’s paper printed an article with its Senate selec-
tions. C. Atkins . was not among them. The picked
three were Senator Simon Fraser, Jimmy M'Coll, late
M.H.R., and old Senator Styles. Atkins was dismissed
with the remark that he was a fine Protectionist and a
fine Australian, and that some day David might think it
opportune to run him for politics. The reasons
for David’s preliminary wobbling and final perfidy
are not hard to see. Styles was a candidate
whose sturdy Protectionist career and rosy chances
of success made it impossible to leave him out.
Sim Fraser is a Giant Axe-bearer and Grand
Apron-wearer of the Orange Societies, and as such is dear
to David, in whose Scotch heart, moreover, the ancient
gibberer has long found place as a beloved crony. But,
more than that, Fraser headed the poll six years ago,
and the man who heads the poll always has a large claim
on David’s support. Jimmy M’Coll, by far the best Pro-
tectionist and Liberal of the Anti-Sosh trio (in which he
and Fraser are included), was chosen apparently
because of his bright chances of election. David
has followed his old policy of picking out
the men most likely to win, in order that after
the elections he may blare loudly that alone he
did it. In the choice of Styles and M’Coll there may
not be so ver} r much to grumble at. But the preference
of Fraser to Atkins turns a fierce and orange glare upon
the throne of David, and the atmosphere in his vicinity
is filled with a doggy smell. Atkins is voung, vigorous,
progressive, and full of an Australian spirit. Fraser
is an old crusted Tory, the adored representative of the
big landlords, and his senility is such that in the Senate
he has never been anything but an object of ridicule. He
is not even a Protectionist. When the weak-kneed tariff
was being framed, Fraser seized nearly every chance he
got to strike it fiercely in the legs with his vote. Where-
fore the perfidious treatment of Atkins brands Syme and
his paper as traitors. It will probably, on December 12,
also brand them as backers of the wrong horse.
J. E. WEST, the honest Democratic candidate
who opposes Yes-No Reid at East Sydney.
Memo. — Mr. West never helped to cut down
any civil servant’s salary.
The Confusion of Gibb.
Gibb, the fat blunderer who is fighting against old
warrior Lyne at the Hume (N.S. W.), seems to al-
most hold the Anti-Sosh record in the matter of
giving away his own case. Here is a sample of
Gibb, quoted from a paper (the Sydney Tele-
graph) which cordially admires him and tries to
put coherence into his remarks :
(1) A land tax for making areas available to the people
was not necessary in any case while the good land in the
vicinity of railways could be resumed for closer settle-
ment, and the Government had power to deal witli the
matter without such legislation as that proposed by the
Labor party.
(2) tie condemned the action of the authorities in
advertising Australia abroad to induce immigration, and
argued that nothing of the kind should be done till the
whole of the young men and others already in the country
had their wants supplied. After that it would be time
enough to encourage immigration.
(3) He demonstrated that Protection was of no use to
the primary producers now that they were producing
more than could be consumed in the Commonwealth,
that prices were fixed by the outside markets of the world,
and that it was farcical for William Lyne, or anyone else,
to pretend that the agricultural class could he assisted by
high duties. The only way to help them was to cheapen
railway and ocean freightage, and establish conditions
which would create a contented and prosperous class on
the land.
(4) He asserted that the progressive land-tax had been
a failure in Maoriland, and that the people there were
already clamoring for the substitution of freehold tenure
for leasehold, which had been unsatisfactory wherever
it was tried, as there was no incentive for people to make
homes and improve their property.
So this is Gibb’s position : (1) It is quite easy to
find land for the people without a graduated
land-tax to break up big estates. (2) There
is such an awful scarcity of land under the pre-
sent system that this great continent, with only
inhabitants to the square mile, can’t afford to
encourage immigration. (3) Protection, that would
create a manufacturing population to which the
farmer could sell his produce on the spot, and
thus save the 10Jd. per bushel which sea-export
costs him, wouldn’t do the farmer any good. Ihe
farmer doesn’t want to save a bushel, and
the only thing is to keep this country empty of
consumers and export the wheat. (4) The M.L.
progressive land-tax. devised so that the small
farmer may have the freehold of his small farm
instead of being the big landlord’s tenant, is a
failure because the people want the freehold.
Gibb ought to go back to private life and to his
old somnolence on the sofa.

Voices from the West.
“Wurrym”: The Tory crowd is dispirited in
Westralia. Forrest continues to cavort across
the landscape spluttering such incoherencies as—
He wanted men to go with him who had opinions of
their own, not men who had no opinions, but obeyed
their unions. He wanted people to obey um. (Laughter.)
He and the happy family of curiosities that
make up the “ W estralian Party ” have but two
planks in their platform': (1) that the Labor
party, having done good work in the past, is a
danger to Westralia; (2) State Rights must be
conserved. Each member of the party talks
round this pair of subjects till his bored audience
dissolves into nothingness. Occasionally one of
them decorates his speech with a gem of thought
like the following :
In the old days the members of the Labor party were
all manual toilers. They were not so now. What were
they ? He knew them to be doctors, dealers, and parsons.
That’s Forrest complaining that the Labor party
is too liberal and too widely representative of the
people. Again :
He was in favor of the Federal capital site being fixed
at an early date. He thought that the States should
retain their borrowing power.
That’s Chas. Clarke, a would-be Senator, who,
having made money by lucky speculations on the
goldfields, considers himself a “representative
man of the State.” Next :
When the Gracchi— amongst the most learned and
pure-minded of men—broached the doctrine of com-
munism in land, it divided Rome into two factions, and
Rome decayed.
That’s by a Mildewed Disaster who answers to
the name of Mills, and has a lot to say about the
French Revolution. Then there are things like
this :
The. Speaker in the United States Con-
gress had spoken in deprecatory terms of
the drift towards Socialism, and the effect
it was having- on America. Socialism had
been tried. Mr. Mills had told them how
it was tried in Greece.. It had been tried
since in Peru, and proved to be a failure.
That’s a sample of the oratory of a
medico named Thurston no,
Paget-Thurston. Delivered in his
best bedside manner, it only resulted
in sarcastic interjections and “other
interruptions,” and what the dailies
politely describe as “ imitations of
domestic animals.” The Bedside
Person evidently thinks that the
Spanish invasion of Peru proved that
the old, kindly Peruvian system was
a failure,* just as an invasion of
ThurstonJs house by a burglar might
be held to prove that Thurston was
no good as a doctor. They are an
amusing lot, these old men of W.A.,
but Jarrah Jack; demanding strong,
independent men who will obey him
and ask no questions, is the most
wonderful of them all.
♦
The Victorian Women’s National
League has become such a joke that
its “ appeal ” to women and similar
persons in connection with the
Federal elections was looked forward
to with more than usual interest.
When the document appeared, it
more than fulfilled expectations..
The old marriage-tie myth had be-
come so moth-eaten that some of the
husbands of the league-women had,
rather gruffly and publicly, told
them to throw the rubbish over-
board. But the league was in such
a destitute condition that, if the
marriage-tie myth were taken out
of the platform, there would have
been only a fragment of the edifice
left. So the appeal contained one
long shriek and two prolonged
wails, in which the marriage-tie was reported
to be in deadly peril and “the home” to be
on the brink of the precipice, while “the
family” was gazing directly into the abyss.
Huge slabs from a foreign person named Gron-
LUND, and other foreign gentlemen named Bax
and Marx, were printed in the manifesto,
showing that, if Watson got into power, the
Family Must Go. In fact, judging from the
appeal, the first plank in the Labor platform is
the “breaking of the marriage-tie and the
abolition of the family.” As for the home,
everybody is to camp out in future, unless Reid
gets back with a big majority.

“ S.” writes :
It is interesting- to note that an outbreak of Anti-Sosh
has taken place in England. Lady Violet Greville,
writing in the Graphic (where pictures of lords and kings
fairly jostle each other), says that the leisured, wealthy
classes are being driven out of England by the Socialists,
whom she denounces with great fury for such a well-
dressed person. She artlessly adds that the usual refuge
of these persecuted fellow-countrymen of hers is France,
Italy, or the Continent in general. Apparently Violet is
unaware that the Government of France is now, and
usually is, in the hands of Socialists ; that Germany has,
in its Social Democrats, the most advanced and largest
political organisation in the world. Also, Italy is largely
Socialistic, and the same may he said of Spain. Com-
pared to the Continent, the English Socialists are very
small and few in a row, and of practically no political
account, so far. Even the moderate Labor Party in the
House of Commons contains only a minority of Socialists ;
and so far this writer hasn’t heard of any Socialists in the
House of Lords. Apparently there is a cold time ahead,
all the same, for the Anti-Sosh party the world over. The
cause of progress is moving ahead so rapidly that Anti-
Sosh has to keep on the run to prevent itself being
trodden on. There are very few places now where it is
safe. China used- to be the prize reactionary and con-
servative country of the world ; hut there are signs
that Anti-Sosh wouldn’t he quite safe even at the far end
of the Yang-tze-Kiang. So far as I know—and I try hard
to keep one eye on Anti-Sosh —the only place where that
much-pursued and harried animal will be safe is the
north-west coast of Greenland. And it is pretty cold
up there ; a lot colder, in fact, than where Anti-Sosh will
go to when it dies, if the Scripture account of what hap-
ji 'iied to Mr. and Mrs. Ananias is correct.

Here I grew tired of Podsnap and opened the
book I had picked up at random on my way out
that morning. It was a volume of Herbert
Spencer, and the first words I chanced on were
these :
Often the most conclusive argument fails to produce
a conviction capable of swaying conduct ; and often mere
assertion, with great emphasis and signs of confidence on
the part of the utterer, will produce a fixed conviction
where there is no evidence. Especially is this so among
those of little culture. Not only may we see the strength
of affirmation and an authoritative manner create faith
in them ; but we may see that their faith sometime
actually decreases if explanation is given.
ANOTHER FLYING WOMBAT.
DE ROUGEMENT: “ Ah, ladies and gentlemen ,

Metcalfe, one of President Back-down Roose-
velt’s Ministers, sent to ’Frisco to bully or coax
the Californians into letting Jap children mix
with those of white parentage in the schools, says
that Japanese are not Mongolians ; therefore the
State law which bars the Jap is unconstitutional.
Rubbish ! Professor Flower, whose authority
on an ethnological question is better than that of
Roosevelt’s whole Cabinet, in a list of dwarf
races of men, says :
In this division are included certain of the Mongolian
or yellow races of Asia—as the Samoyedes, the Ostiaks,
the Japanese, the Siamese, and the Annamites.
In this list of the Jap’s connections, by the way,
is one whose king has lately been cooking and
eating his wives ! The French ethnologists,
Topinard and Quatrefages, say that the round-
headed, frizzly-haired, dwarfish Negritos, as they
are called in the Philippines, are to be found in
Formosa, and adds—
But, beyond that, in Liou Ohiou and the south of
Japan, it shows itself , in the traces it has left, in the
present population.
Another pleasant family connection for “ our
gallant ally.” For here we have it on the very
highest scientific authority that the Jap is not
only connected with the most barbarous Mongo-
lian stocks, but is tainted with a nigger cross.

“ Hassan” (from a Sydney suburb) on the poli-
tical situation :
lam a democrat. I believe that Australia is the finest
country in the world. I believe also in State control of
the food-supply, in the Gothenburg- liquor system, and in
a legalised State totalisator. I believe in breaking up the
big estates. I do not care which party will give these
things, to that party goes my vote. The Freetrade can-
didate has no hope ; I am even now' maturing a dead cut
in a lonely place for him. The Protectionist is non-
existent in my electorate. Ido not trust a party which
holds the economic absurdity of high wages and cheap
foreign competition. Even if a Labor candidate calls him-
self Protectionist, the caucus may over-rule him, and
vote with Reid. I have hopes of the Labor party ; it is
led by the most honest man in Federal politics. When it
refuses to be dishonest at the dictation of the Trades
Hall —for it was dishonest to “put the mercenaries to
the sword,” and when it declares for Protection (I would
even connive at a little dishonesty for this last), it will
get my enthusiastic vote. So far as my politics
are. eoncerned, I am for those very' “mercenaries”
rather than for the extreme Labor section. Now,
one of the candidates offered me is a Labor man.
I cannot, holding the urgent necessity for a high tariff,
give him my vote. The other is a young gentleman who
drives about in a motor-car, and holds views on Defence
which a 14-year-old boy should be ashamed of. He isaFree-
trader, and he certainly will get no vote of mine. And
yet I am told it is my duty to vote, and I feel that it is.
Wherefore, I will go to the polling place and carefully
scratch out both these names as a small protest against
the folly of a tariff-sinking Australian Democratic party,
and the haughty imbecility of the young Freetrade
motor-car person. It will be objected that half a loaf is
better than no bread, but a non-fiscal third party, which
may possibly give support for concessions to Reid, is no
party for me. I will take no risks. When the Labor
party declares for Protection I will only scratch out the
motor-car. And there are, I feel sure, thousands of
electors who think just as I do on the question.
+-
Anti-Sosh has got itself in a tangle at Balaclava
(Vic.). George Turner’s retirement made Bala-
clava anybody’s chance. A Labor candidate came
forward in oil-distiller Hampson, a rather weary
person from Bendigo. The Ministry’s flag is
carried by little Roberts. Hewison, a “eul-
chawed ” lawyer, g;ot the nomination of the
Political Women with Expensive Bonnets and
the Weird Citizen’s League. Agar Wynne, once
M.L.C., came out on his own and did a vigorous
canvass, and backed by the Age (which seems to
have gone considerably off its head of late) some
people reckoned Agar might almost Wynne.
The Argus wobbled, uncertain whether to howl
for the man it wanted, or the man who seemed
likely to get in whether it wanted him or hot.
Finally, three men with long slack whiskers arbi-
trated, and Hewison was told that the Women
With Expensive Bonnets and the Weird Citizens
had decided to withdraw him. And Hewison
says he isn’t a motion or a cork to be withdrawn
by anybody or everybody. Possibly, on election
day, Hampson will find himself gasping with
amazement at the top of the poll

FOR AUSTRALIA!
A Plain Request to Gr. Reid.
The Scotch part of The Bulletin continues very
tired of George Reid’s thick fog of words regard-
ing Socialism, and it proposes that George shall
come out of the fog and say definitely what part
of Socialism he is anti to and intends to abolish.
This can be done in the simplest and most con-
clusive manner. All Reid has to do is to take
the Estimates of Expenditure, and rule out the
socialistic lines that he won’t put up with.
Socialism costs money every time; so the anti-
Socialist can get to the very Root of the Abomina-
tion in the Estimates, and destroy the thing by the
simple and direct process of refusing to provide
the payment of it. Moreover, if G. Reid
isn t prepared to refuse to pay for the Abomina-
tion, then he isn’t an anti-Socialist at all—he is
merely a place-hunting humbug. The horrible
thing trails right through the Estimates from the
first page to the last—Commonwealth and State
Estimates alike. On the very first page, the Par-
liamentary reporting staff is provided for. Private
Enterprise can report debates; in fact, Private
Enterprise does the work in the S. Australian
State Parliament. Will George Reid be the anti-
Socialist he says he is, and pledge himself to sack
Hansard staff ? Page 11 of this year’s Estimates
deals with the Parliamentary refreshment-room.
There is a steward, an assistant steward, a prin-
cipal cook Joe appears from the records to be
only a secondary member of the family—and other
Socialistic officers. Will G. Reid be the anti-
Socialist he says he is, and sack the steward,
assistant steward and principal cook, and let
Private Enterprise feed him ? Twelve thousand
pounds a,re provided for, a page or two later, as
Socialistic subsidies to the Pacific Islands mail
services. Private Enterprise demands £6OOO a
year for a service to the New Hebrides, the
.Solomons, and a, few other islands. Will G. R eid
be the anti-Socialist he says he is, and let Private
Enterprise make its own terms with the people
who want to write to the New Hebrides
about the 20 yards of Turkey twill that they
desire to sell to their black brothers ? Fifteen
hundred pounds are down for “ expenses of
making inquiries and preparing plans for addi-
tional lighthouses.” Will G. Reid explain why
lie didn’t fight this Socialistic item, and will he.
swear that he will let Private Enterprise build
future lighthouses ? The Government Printer’s
department cost £16,479 last year. Will G. Retd
knock off talking a mere mist of words, and pro-
mise to abolish the Government printery and sack
all hands? As for the Postmaster-General’s
Department, it is one huge, glittering outcrou of
Socialism. Will Reid, G., be the anti-Socialist
he says he is, and let Private Enterprise do the
work? The thing is simplicity itself. The first item
is •• Central staff: Secretary, £1000.” Will Reid
as the leader of the party of anti-Socialism’
pledge himself to strike out that item? When
the public wants to send a small parcel out to a
suburb, it drops a note into a carrier’s letter-box,
and the parcel is carted out before the end of the
week—for sixpence or so, if it is a very small
parcel, and the suburb isn’t remote, and the
roads aren’t bad. As the leading anti-Socialist,
will George Reid undertake to strike the Post-
master-General’s Department items out of the
next Estimates, and let Private Enterprise carry
on the business of letter-delivery, as it now does
that of parcel-delivery? Then, when G. Reid
has thus destroyed the Monster that he say’s he
wants to destroy in the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment, will he continue the destruction in the
State Parliament? Will he undertake to give
one month’s notice to every Jack and Jill
in the Education Department ? Will he tell the
Sydney Grammar School (where the most gorsreous
anti-Sooialists have their sons educated) that it
shall have no more Socialistic State aid? He
can’t kill Socialism by shooting at it with his
mouth from a, platform. He can kill it nearly
dead by sacking the people who do the Socialistic
things. Will he pledge himself to sack them?
If not, all Gr. Reid’s anti-Socialism is mere hum-
bug and rubbish.

The Lie of the Scarce Land Party.
So popular is Watson’s graduated land-tax be-
coming that the Tory press and the Tory candi-
dates are alarmed, and are lying with even more
than their usual vehemence over the matter,
Finding that many farmers, who are unable to
obtain land either for themselves or their sons,
are inclined to support the tax, the Tory party
solemnly and persistently warns them that
Watson s proposal is a sham, and that Watson
himself is a hypocrite of the first degree. His
real intention, so these persons declare, is to take
the land from everybody. The squatters are to
be attacked first, but the farmers are certain to
be despoiled later. Now, even granting that
Watson is the Devil in disguise, and that he
really intends doing, or rather trying to do, all
this, surely a little reflection will show the
absurdity of it ? For, if the land is to be taken
from everybody, who is it to be given to, or what
is going to be done with it? Not even theS.M.
Herald or the Argus suggests that the Labor
party is going to eat it, or intends to cart it out
and dump it in the Southern Ocean. Both these
fatuous rags simply say that “the Socialists are
going to take it,” and there they stop, just when
they are almost beginning to grow interesting.
Curiously enough, it is the very process which
Watson advises that would make Watson’s
alleged conspiracy impossible, and it is the very
process which the Tories advocate that would
make Watson s alleged horrible scheme quite
easy. Watson’s policy aims at the creation of a
huge body of farmers, and is its own protection
against the principle being carried too far. At
present, owing to the fact that huge fertile areas
are carefully kept unpopulated by the great land-
lords, the balance of voting power is easily in
favor of the cities. But let the country districts
become thickly studded with farmers,'and with
small towns dependent on farmers, and the
balance of power would cease to be on the side of
Labor strongholds—the cities. As a matter of
simple fact, Watson and his party, in advocating
a policy that will encourage land settlement, are
really helping to limit their own power ; but the
farmer has got so muddle-headed with reading
the Herald and the Argus, and listening to
Reid and Jocook and old Pulsford, that he is
almost afraid to leave his plough out at nights if
an advocate of land-taxation is about. Also, his
vanity is stirred when the squatter invites him to
stand ); side by .side ’’with him “to resist the
spoi. er ; and he loses sight of the fact that he is
being spoiled himself all the while
Our Unguarded Back Door.
Partly owing to Prime Minister Deakin’s over-
great anxiety to be economical, and partly owing
to the treachery of S. Australia’s ex-Premier Jen-
kins and the arrogance of its present Premier
Price, the second Australian Parliament ended
with the Northern Territory question still un-
settled. Price demands, as the figure at which
b. Australia will surrender the Territory, that the
Commonwealth shall take over all its debt —
which, a year ago, was £3,658,170, and is now
rather more—and, though the debt is'monstrous
compared with the population, the Territory is
dirt cheap at the price. Any Government which
could find the money to finish the transcontinental
railway, and thus open up the Territory to popu-
lation, could make it worth a dozen times the
amount of its debt. But the bulk of the debt
only represents deficits and mismanagement, and
Prime Minister Deakin, in his excessive economy,
wants only to take over that portion which
is represented by visible assets, leaving the
rest for S. Australia to pay. This is grossly un-
fair, and there is nothing to be gained by the
unfairness. No matter how desperately econo-
mical Deakin may be, the Tory and anti-Federal
press will still mumble its old tale about “Federal
extravagance,” so Alfred might as well resume
his wonted affability and make a more generous
offer. Next, Price, of S. Australia, demands that
the Australian Government shall complete the
transcontinental railway, and not only that, but
shall complete it along the route of the existing
survey or thereabouts. This—especially the
second condition —seems needlessly arrogant dic-
tation on the part of Price, yet at the same time
it seems that Deakin is unnecessarily particular
in not letting Price enjoy his arrogance in peace.
When Australia gets possession of the Territory,
it must build the railway in red-hot haste—it
AN AMAZING CIRCUMSTANCE.
Mr. Reid bewails the circumstance that thousands of
electors who should be heart and soul with him have de-
serted his cause in support of comparatively unimportant
ssues.
GEORGE: “ Well, well, bless my soul! The thing
seems very little use as a lure, after all. It
actually scares the birds.”
is the only way to make the Territory pay,
and every day’s delay means dead loss, for
the Territory’s deficit is growing all the time.
And, as for the route which the line is to
follow—a matter about which Price is super-
fluously combustible in his methods—it is, so far as
is known, the best route yet discovered. Under
these circumstances, Price’s terms might as well
be accepted. Finally, Deakin wants S. Australia,
before he takes over the Territory, to give up its
mean and snarling refusal to let the other trans-
continental railway—the one to Perth—pass
through its bit of desert, and it seems sheer
foolishness to let that side issue stand in the way.
The Northern Territory should be secured on the
instant, even if it had to be done on worse terms
than S. Australia demands, and the securing of it
should be the first business of the new Parlia-
ment. As it stands it is a huge danger. It is a
place that it is impossible to defend without a rail-
way. It is so empty that, according to all theories
of international law, any foreign power may claim
it off us on the ground of lack of effective occupa-
tion. Worst of all, it is a place which is simply
administered by S.A., and that State is
only in temporary possession by permission of
Britain. One of the terms to be fulfilled before
S. Australia could get complete possession was
the completion of the transcontinental railway,
and unless some power completes that line Britain
may yet resume the Territory, and make it a
Crown Colony, with the land let out to big syndi-
cates, and worked by millions of niggers and
Chinamen. To waste time bargaining over small
details when the country is standing on the verge
of a volcano of this sine is reckless—and even if
Price is willing to sacrifice the interests of Aus-
tralia while he haggles over the last copper, that
is no reason why the Commonwealth should be
equally blind and unpatriotic. Meanwhile, by
way of a side issue, while the bargaining goes on,
the inevitable land-grant railway syndicate makes
its appearance. There have been many such in
the past, and they all proved bogus and futile,
but some day a genuine one may happen. Then,
probably, S. A. will withdraw its offer to surrender
the Territory, and the transcontinental line will
be built as a private spec., and the back-door
of Australia will be left in the hands of a private
syndicate. Certainly the attitude of S. Australia
over the proposed line to Westralia is mean and
petty and exasperating; but that should not be
allowed to stand in the way of the public interest.
When once the Commonwealth gets possession of
the Northern Territory it can explain clearly to
S. Australia that it must either consent to the
building of the so-called transcontinental (it is
really a coastal) line from Adelaide to Perth, or
else a real transcontinental railway will be bunt
across the southern fringe of the Territory to con-
nect Perth with Sydney and Brisbane, and Ade-
laide will be left on one side as a mere by-product.
But that is a matter for the future. The first
question is to secure the Northern Territory for
the Commonwealth, and put a big chain on Aus-
tralia’s back door.

Anti-Sosh Which is Not Bosh.
Anti-Sosh in Australia is, so far, just Bosh—
Bosh, with a fat, ridiculous person as chief bosher,
and a mournful consciousness in its heart that
there is nothing real in its existence, that it
is tmly a shadow of a movement and a ghost of a
party. Anti-Sosh in other lands is a different
matter; and it is just as well for the Australian
elector, who may be inclined to view with amused
indifference the G. Reid antics, to recognise that
anti-Sosh may become a matter of serious
danger. Winston Churchill, the Ameri-
can novelist (not the Winston Churchill
of England, who self-ad vertises so acutely),
was recently a Candidate for a State gover-
norship; and part
of his platform
was an advocacy of
State-owned rail-
ways. He was not
able to get in a
single paper in the
State an intimation
that he was a can-
didate. The iron
hand of the rail-
way com panies
gagged every jour-
nal. His chance
with the electors
was smothered as
effectively as if he
had been sand-
bagged. This is
anti-Sosh as it is
understood in
America. It is no
pretence, no trick
cry behind which
sectarianism can
lurk or poiitical
indolence mask it-
self. It is a real
politicalforce with
the conscience and
the methods of the
Thug, and with a
strangle - hold on
Democracy. A
little encourage-
ment to G. Reid,
and anti-Sosh will
develop on the
same lines in Aus-
tralia. Capitalism,
under modern con-
ditions of civilisa-
tion, has grown to
be a power so vast,
so rapacious, and
so unscrupulous in
its methods that
nothing is too ex-
treme to be possi-
ble in its plans to
combat the cam-
paign for the bet-
terment of the
masses. It is even
hinted to-day in
Europe—and the
hint has such a
mass of circumstantial evidence to support it
as to almost make out a prima facie case—
that anarchist outrages, which seem to be the spora-
dic outbreaks of individual anti-Socialists, carrying
their convictions to a fatally logical conclusion,
are really the organised and designed weapons of
Capitalism, intended sometimes to discredit
democratic political movements, sometimes to
facilitate Stock Exchange coups, but always
ordered and controlled by the Money Power.
The idea seems, at first blush, ridiculous; but it is
not carrying recklessness much farther than did
the organised iron-masters of America, headed by
Carnegie and Erick, when they deliberately
forced on the Pittsburg bloodshed so as to smash
the Iron Trades Union ; and there is a great body
of suspicious coincidences to connect anarchist
outrages with the campaign of Capitalism against
the people. Anti-Sosh, as Australia knows it,
is a thing to scorn. • As America and Europe
know it, it is something to fear. And from one it
may grow to the other.

The Rice Christian in Politics.
Thus does the S.M. Herald, which indulges in
daily diatribes about the time-serving tactics of
Deakin in his alleged pandering to the Labor
party, hold forth about Bowden, alleged Eree-
trade and Anti-Sosh candidate, for the Nepean
(N.S.W.): —
Lithgow is the biggest polling place in the electorate.. »
The ironworks (Sandford’s) represent the one big con-
sideration, and business men, professional imen, artisans
and laborers alike will vote for the man who will help Mr.
Sandford’s project along... When it became known that
Mr. Bowden was a Freetrader it looked as if he could
expect little support, for Mr. Sandford has said that a
12£ per cent, duty is necessary to firmly establish the
business. .. But, most important of all is Mr. Bowden’s
declaration that he is in favor of the lty per cent. duty.
As a Freetrader he regards a 10 per cent, duty as a
revenue tariff, and if, as Mr. Sandford says, the extra 2J
percent, is going to make all the difference, then he is
not prepared to cavil at its incidence.
Regarded as two shameless time-servers who will
do anything on earth to get votes the S.M.
Herald and its friend Bowden, who now professes
to regard 10 or 121 per cent. Protection as Eree-
trade. should hold the record. Yet a great many
people are imposed on by the Freetrade person
who is willing to protect one industry, and fail to-
realise how badly they get left when they vote for
the Rice Christian of the Bowden stamp, Ihe
result pans out like this : Bowden, the Freetrader,
is willing, for the sake of getting votes a,t Lithgow,
to protect the Lithgow iron business, but
in other matters he is the same old destroyer of
Australian industry and the same old prop of the
foreign importer. Somewhere else Smith, or
«Tones, Freetrader, is willing to protect woollens
for the sake of the local vote, but otherwise he is
the same old enemy, and he doesn’t see why he
should help to protect iron, there being none m
his electorate.' At a third place, BobsoN, Free-
trader, is willing to buy local votes with a duty
on hats, but takes no interest in protecting
woollens; and somewhere else Binks, Iree-
trader, is willing to sell his immortal principles
and buy votes with a duty on boots, but doesn’t
care tuppence for hats. And if about 50 of these
people get in, all of them Freetraders who, like
Bowden, are pledged to Protection for the sake
of votes, the lamentable result is that, after all,
each one has only pledged himself to Protection
for the one industry which will get him votes. So
there is one vote for protecting each industry,
and 49 against it. Bowden may be willing, for
the sake of the Lithgow vote, to vote for a Pro-
tective duty on iron, but his vote will do no good to
Lithgow unless he has with him a party which
believes in protecting iron, and the only party
which is unanimous for the Protection of iron is
the party which believes in Protection all round.
One solitary Rice Christian isn’t a majority, and
hardly amounts to even a visible minority. Con-
sequently, these are the questions which Lithgow
should put to Bowden :
(1) Do you believe in effective Protection for all Aus-
tralian industries as well as iron ?
(2) Do you belong to a party which believes in the
effective protection of all Australian industries ?
(3) Will your friends, the Freetrade boot-Protection
man, and the Freetrade hat-Protection man, and the
Freetrade woollen-Protection man, and all the rest of the
Freetrade-Protection men also vote for Protection for our
iron industry?
(4) If you are a solitary iron-Protection pelican in a
Freetrade wilderness, what good are you to us?
(5) And if you won’t vote for protecting boot and hat
and woollen industries in other electorates, how do you
propose to get the members for these electorates to help
you in protecting us?—in other words, how are you going
to avoid being a solitary pelican, as above described, in the
wilderness hereinbefore mentioned?
If Bowden and the other Freetraders of his
kind can’t answer these questions satisfactorily,
no intelligent body of electors has any use for
them.
P.” WRITES :
Sydney Tory papers, which refuse to give Labor candi-
dates a hearing by reporting their speeches, wax furious
whenever a few people make an interjection or two at a
Tory candidate’s meeting. “ They won’t give us a fair
hearing,” they yell. Then they turn the crank of the
patent office lie machine, and grind out something which
they allege is proof that the Labor leaders have con-
spired to prevent free speech. Here is a Herald sample
of the substance •
“ The Labor leaders may disclaim all responsibility for
these organised disturbances, but a specific instance is
reported to the People’s Reform League. At a meeting
held by Mr. J. Hindle, anti-Soeialist candidate for the
Cook electorate, a man who announced himself as the
President of a Labor League urged the people to interrupt
and howl down the speaker. The police were asked to
show themselves on the platform, and see if they could
secure order. As soon as they were seen on the platform
the Labor President addressed the noisy portion of the
audience, and asked them to give the speaker a hearing.”
It all happened thus : Holy Hindle started by trying
some Geo. Reid “ witticisms ” on the crowd. It was a
good-humored, non-critical crowd, and it accepted the
witticisms as quite fresh, and laughed. Then the chair-
man said something in a stern voice, and a severe-visaged
lady on the stage looked pitchforks through her pince-
nez, and shook her hat feathers fiercely. Hindle con-
tinued his witticisms, and the crowd continued to testify
its appreciation with loud hilarity. Then the local
Labor president mounted a chair, and asked the
crowd not to laugh any more, as Mr. Hindle might
have something serious to say. The point seemed
to strike the crowd as feasible, and it prepared to take
Hindle seriously. In another ten seconds it would have
been the most serious, attentive crowd in Sydney, but
before it had time to get the smile off its countenance
the police strode in, and emptied out a very serious-look-
ing old gentleman who hadn’t laughed once. Perhaps he
was fired because he couldn’t see Hindle’s “humor.” I
could discover no other reason.
The Labor President didn't urge the people to “ howl
down the speaker,” and the people didn’t howl—they just
laughed at Hindle’s “ jokes.” But the point I particu-
larly want to stress is that the Labor President
appealed to the crowd before the police appeared, so that
he wasn’t bluffed into it by the police, as the Herald
alleges. His well-meant act was twisted by the Tory
push into some sort of a low-down dodge.

gentle in their action, and more reliable, as they
can always be depended upon. Sold everywhere

Hell.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Baptist parson P. Carey has resigned a church lecture
ship because he doesn’t quite believe in Hell. His fellow
parsons view his position with profound sorrow.
Now I gather by deduction
And by ratiocination,
By air-pressure and by suction,
And by every indication,
Rule, or method scientific
Which the human tongue can tell,
That the worst of sins horrific
Is to disbelieve in Hell.
To be squeamish on the question
(So the Baptists all are urging)
Is a moral indigestion,
Which demands relentless purging.
You’re unsound in Little. Mary,
And a queasy infidel,
If you take the track of Cakey—
If you are not sound on Hell.
For the Christian hale and hearty,
With a stomach iron-plated,
Likes to damn the other party
In the method Calvin stated ;
And his mighty Sunday dinners
Wouldn’t please him half so well,
If he couldn’t think of sinners
Who are frying down in Hell 1

stimulates the activites oh the bowels and kidneys.
It cleanses the bowels, acts as a diluent, and
flushes the kidneys in a most satisfactory way.
Thorough elimination is salvation, and there is no
better eliminator than Kutnow’s Powder.

WRITES :
“Tripoli, Syria, July 20th, 1905.
“Dear Sirs, —It gives me pleasure to let you
know the result of my trial of Kutnow’s Powder.
It is an efficient remedy in regulating liver
secretions and curing skin diseases due to dis-
ordered functions of the said organ.—Yours truly,
“J. ABELA, M.D.”
The Advantages of Kutnow’s Powder.
SIR JAMES CRICHTON BROWNE said that a prolongation of
life is not desirable unless that life be vigorous and happy.
Many of the quick-killing diseases that involve but brief
disability and suffering, like typhus and typhoid fever, are decreasing,
while slowly degenerative diseases, involving protracted invalidism
and much misery, like Bright’s disease, diabetes, and cirrhosis of the
liver, are mounting up. - Society has always had to pay for every
mistake it makes, except when the habit of hygienic correction is
cultivated. PROEESSOR LAWSON TAIT, M.D. recognised the
importance of removing the debris of undigested food the morning-
after the banquet, and not only prescribed Kutnow’s Powder in his
hospital and private practice, but used it personally for years with
unqualified success. The secret of health is often found in the
elimination of uric acid, and this is easily achieved by the use of
Kutnow’s Powder. It cleanses the stomach, rouses the liver, flushes
the kidneys, and clears the bowels. By this simple means the errors
of excess in diet and drink are corrected, and the poisonous ddbris
removed from the system.
How to
Detect Fraud !
The genuine and original Kutnow’s
Powder can be had of all conscien-
tious Chemists throughout the
world. See that the fac-simile sig-
nature, “ S. Kutnow and Co., Ld.,”
and the registered trade-mark
“ Hirschensprung, or Deer Leap,”
are on the carton and bottle. You
will then avoid fraud, and
Get Kutnow’s
Powder.

“Many thanks for Kutnow’s
Powder you sent me for the Thermal

beneficial for my Rheumatic and
Gouty Patients, both in the hospital
as well as for those patients taking
the Aix-les-Bains cure.

“ Dear Sirs, —I have no objection to your pub-
lishing my testimony concerning the excellent
properties of Kutnow’s Powder. I can only wish
I had tried it years ago. In my case it has proved
to be an agreable and gentle aperient, cleansing

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Lawks ! How the Blacks are falling:!”
So cried Scrubologista on London house-top,
While smuts dropt adown from the sky,
All fogacious, murky, and smoke-clouded,
Upon snowdroppery of sheets and shirts.
Thus dropt sky pilots upon Melbourne —
Not a shower of big fat black frogs,
But amiable, ambling, smirking gents.
In fair round stump-jack, with good grub well-lined,
Full of rheologic saws and antique instances.
A few came out of golden shower-baths,
Forty quid a week, and so downwards.
A twentj T -pounder would be rather poor,
Ten pounds a miserable pittance,
As I have heard one designate that very wage ;
But then came Charley Matthews, Bush Brother,
The gentleman from Dubbo.
Would you believe it ? He only gets ten bob,
With damper and a blue Matilda.
Yet does more good ecclesiastic graft
Than any pair of Fats.
Give your respects, howe’er, to certain Gaiters,
Those of Carpentaria and New Guinea,
North Queensland and of Perth,
Their blackened legs now twinkle merrily.
But, perhaps, they draw on moleskins in the bush,
And get a lift from bullock-puncher
Wherever bullocks are in vogue.
Well, now, this Congress waits upon Mayor Weedon ;
Allis kootoo, salaam, and tiddy-falli-falloo.
Then hie to the Cathedral. Lo i a procession,
Headed by a funny little banneret.
Solemn walk round ; a holy Jericho
In the thick of Melbourne’s busy city.
White-robed phoongyes carry big, thick sticks
With silvery hooks on top, or electro-plate.
Most solemn slow the pace.
Then Newcastle’s bishop unpacks epigrams
Thick as Chinese crackers.
Now debate ensues within Town Hall.
Heterodoxers have been sharpening teeth.
One Blackmore and one Reverend Hart,
They pour boiling water on the ant-heap
Of Digby Berry, and th’ Evangelical crowd
Who, to say truth, are hit below the belt,
Taken unawares, as plain Bill Squires
Would never job antoganist.
Now rises Bishop Mercer, of Tassy,
To'proclaim the cheerful Gospel.
Age and Argus punctuate much laughter,
While Berry, Archdall, and that excellent kidney,
Can do little more than sneeze.
Fierce and indignant are the protests
That the show is being given away—
Nelson’s Trafalgar broadside
Into the stern-fittings of Santissima Trinidad
Not more disastrous.

I The humorous Women’s National League
has issued an election circular to the Victorian
farmers. It gives the backbone explicit instruc-
tions as to how and when to vote, as follows :
If possible, be near the booth the night before the
elections, vote early in the morning, get back to your
harvest and send your wife and daughters to the poll.
When you have done your duty, get back and save your
crop. Remember, the trend of the Senate is to become
Socialistic, and, if the Socialists have their way, you will
have no crop to save, nor any say in your own affairs.
Some farmer will yet go mad owing to the helter-
skelter ways of the Women’s Ananias League.
Its breathless advice to him to camp out at the
polling-booth, leaving the wife and girls to see
that the Socialists don’t steal the crop during the
night; its hurried warning that he is to race back
and save the crop lest there are more Socialists
stealing it than the wife and family and dog
can handle; its gloomy admonition that he is to
stand by the crop while the family is away voting
lest the worst should happen; and its frantic
exhortation to remember that if the Socialists get
in they are going to abolish agriculture, so that
there will never again be any crop—all these are
things which tend to drive the placid agricul-
turist off his “ dot.”
The Cressbrook Estate.— Messrs. Isles, Love
and 00. report a brisk demand for the illustrated plans
of the Cressbrook Estate, which is to he sold by auction
on the 15th instant. An analysis of the 20 years’ terms
shows the following interesting particulars :—With milk
at sd. per gallon, which is the ruling price at the Cress-
brook milk factory on the estate, and taking the average
value of the land at £6 per acre, one gallon of milk per
day will pay principal and interest on l(it acres of land,
ot the milk of one cow estimated at the moderate quan-
tity of eight quarts per day, will pay principal and interest
on 33 acres ; or, to put it still plainer, the milk of two
cows at two gallons per day each, will pay principal and
interest on £lOOO worth of land. The Cressbrook condensed
milk is widely and favorably known, and the demand is
much greater than the supply, consequently the price
of milk is not likely to decline, and it is needless to
point out that the dairymen who supply to milk factories
obtain a far higher return than those working for butter.
The quality of the land to be sold is so excellent that it is
only necessary to quote from the reports of Messrs. John
Forrest and John Cameron, one of whom says, “ Acre for
acre, I do not know where it can be equalled ” ; and the
other, after inspecting and valuing all the freehold
estates in the Upper Brisbane River district, says that
“ The Cressbrook Estate is by far the most valuable of
them all.” Arrangements have been made to meet every
train at Toogoolawab, and to provide every facility for
inspection. The vendors will also pay the railway fares
of purchasers from any part of the Commonwealth.*
Tyree, the man who introduced Acetylene into
Australasia at Sleepy Hollow, Nelson, Maoriland (where
he was promptly fired out by the City Council as a man
with ideas that would quickly close up their little local
gasworks) has now tackled another undertaking. Not
satisfied with fighting nine patent law suits against
infringers in eight years ; persuading the insurance com-
panies to accept Acetylene ; hustling the shipping com-
panies and railway men, uptil they agreed to carry
carbide ; waiting on butchers, bakers and candlestick-
makers who run the various municipal councils of
Australasia to pass reasonable laws, and filling up odd
moments by developing the Acetylene business until
now about 4000 tons of carbide are imported
annually into Australasia, he now proposes to
coyer the earth with an invention that provides
a new use entirely for carbide in the shape of an
Automatic Spray. The power is developed by the use
of a small quantity of calcium carbide put into a thing
that looks'like an oil-drum with a pipe , stuck in it; with
this simple-looking affair a spray as fine as dew or a
stream forty feet long can be used at will. The pur-
chaser can paint his house, whitewash the fowl-yard, kill
the insects in the gardens or orchards, destroy the rabbits
on the run, clean his windows, wash the cart, spray the
dogs and horses, kalsomine the rooms, put out a fire,
and finish up the day’s work by giving the kids a needle
bath.*
T. Skene and Agar Wynne, both Victorian
Tories, are quoted enthusiastically by a Sydney
Tory paper as alleging that the small farmer
would be ruined by the graduated land-tax which
wouldn’t touch him at all. He would be ruined
by not being taxed, in fact, and when people who
had lent him money on his property found it
wasn’t taxed, they would “call their money in”
(this is Agar Wynne), and “ruin would stare
many in the face” (also Agar Wynne). At pre-
sent it is mostly the landlord (such as Agar
Wynne) who stares the farmer in the face.


The truth of the matter is-THIS!
The reason that most Paints crack and peel off is simply because
they are not ELASTIC.
When the Oil, which is the LIFE of a Paint, evaporates, it leaves
a CRUSTY SURFACE of pigment, and as the changes in the atmos-
phere takes place, expanding and contracting the surface —OFF comes
the paint.
Now, Arco Elastic Carbon Paint is, as its name implies,
ELASTIC. That is, it contracts and expands with the climatic
changes, and thus, under ALL circumstances and conditions, it STICKS.
Under ordinary conditions Arco Elastic Carbon Paint will last
INDEFINITELY, but under SEVERE conditions it’s Guaranteed
for FIVE YEARS.

A CURED WOMAN
Relates her Intense Sufferings—how Doctors
Failed to do her any Good. She Finally Tries
Clements Tonic
Which flakes Permanent Cure.
(BY A SYDNEY REPORTER.)
Here is a narrative which will assuredly put many a reader on the right track —supplied to us by
Mrs. Annie Young, of Myrtle-street, Leichhardt. It was at Mrs. Young’s present address, where
she lias been living for the past eleven years, that our special correspondent was granted the inter-
view which appears hereunder ■
“It is thirteen years since I had the illness you refer to. It doesn t seem half so long ago, for
everything is as fresh in my memory as though it was only yesterday.”
“Were you experiencing any physical pain?” _ _
“Oh ! don’t talk about it. Have you ever had neuralgia m the head? I hope not, for it was
something dreadful. Right across the forehead, through from one temple to the other, and up to the
top of my head, the most acute pain imaginable harassed me. The agony was so great that often I
imagined something was pressing on my brain, and I really used to think I would go mad with it.
It had such an effect on me, indeed, that even my sight went bad, and, as for the feeling in my eyes
—well, they felt as if they were double the size they should have been. Ah ! what desolate, melan-
choly days they were ! I’m sure I felt myself to be about the most unhappy woman in the world,
and 1 think I had occasion to be in view of the fact that the outlook was so black.”
“ Do you mean that your prospects of getting strong again seemed remote ?”
“They did, indeed, for I had been attended to by several doctors, and the most they could dofor
me was to give ’just a little relief now and then ; but there was nothing lasting about it, and if I felt a
trifle better one day, I was sure to feel ten times worse the next, and the medicine, besides being so
ineffective, was always disagreeable to take. A strange thing was that I felt always so worn-out,
drowsy and exhausted—as if I was only fit to go somewhere and lie down and die—yet, when I made
an effort to sleep, do you think I could ? Not a bit of it. I’d twist and turn nearly the whole night
through, and when at last I dosed off the dreams I had were fearful.”
“ And you couldn’t get permanent relief from these symptoms through the medicine prescribed
for you ? n
“No, unfortunately. But finally I got something to do me good. Clements Tonic it was,
and the best remedy I ever had in all my life, too. Goodness, what a show it made of everything
else I had taken, for instead of only easing me a little occasionally, it went right to the base of my
infirmities, and lifted them out by the roots ! In addition to what I have already told you, I must
state that I was highly nervous—nobody could be more so, for I was actually afraid to stay in my own
house by myself, and was continually worrying myself about things that I imagined were going to
happen. Trouble was always hanging over me, and I couldn’t get the idea out of my head—not until
I had been taking Clements Tonic for a space of time, when, quite mysteriously, I ceased brooding
over such silly things, and my mind became as happy as the day. Oh ! it was wonderful what an
altered woman Clements Tonic made me. Instead of being anxious and timid all day, I got as happy
and cheerful as possible—nothing frightened me, and my nerves were steady. It is because I know
so many nervous women that I deem it my duty to say what a splendid remedy Clements Tonic is for
that complaint, though, for that matter, it was equally beneficial to me in other ways. I used to get
pains down the small of my back and about my shoulders, also palpitation and pains in the region of
my heart, which made me think that something very serious was wrong with me there ; but Clements
Tonic showed itself to be such a pain-removing medium that I can faithfully recommend it to all
sufferers. Its regulating influences on the heart were extraordinary, and for making one’s sleep sound
and peaceful, the same remedy was the only one to meet with my requirements. I wish I had used it
months before, for plenty of people told me what a grand medicine Clements Tonic was. The least I
can do is to assist my neighbors to throw off their afflictions, so you may publish my experiences in
any manner you like.”

JOHN GRAVEN-BURLEIGH’S
TRUE HAIR GROWER
ASTOUNDS AUSTRALIANS.
GREAT DEMAND FOR TRIAL BOXES.
THE STORY OF JOHN CRAVEN-
BURLEIGH, THE ENGLISH
MERCHANT WHO DISCOV-
ERED THE MOST FAMOUS
HAIR REMEDY IN THE
WORLD,
Mr. John Craven-Burleigh, the English
merchant, who, a few years ago, retired from
his former business to exploit the merits of a
hair preparation, is making it interesting for
Australian men and women who have vainly
Mr. John Craven-Burleigh.
sought healthy scalps and plentiful hair.
He starts the hair before asking you to buy.
The phenomenal success of this wonderful
preparation has astonished the world. People
have written in, saying “Hair has grown
where there was never hair before,” or
“ After being bald for years, your True Hair
Grower has produced long, thick hair.”
This great hair producing formula was
discovered by accident. The story goes—
that a few years ago, while travelling in
Switzerland, Mr. Craven-Burleigh met a
noted Swiss savant who made the science of
hair growing a life study. This learned
savant was induced by Mr. Craven- Burleigh
to permit the latter personally to try out a
preparation that the savant had just perfected.
The result was astonishing. At the end of
forty days, after having been very bald for
several years, Mr. Craven-Burleigh’s head was
covered with a thick, healthy growth of hair.
Exclusive permission was immediately
obtained for Mr. Craven-Burleigh to manu-
facture and sell the preparation to the public.
At first, further experiments were made in
and around London with astonishing results.
Then the countries of Holland, Germany,
France, Italy and Russia were taken up.
In all 700,000 cases have been treated
during the past five years with a wonderful
record of success.
In advertising to the Australian people,
Mr. Craven-Burleigh felt that the seriousness
of his apparently extravagant claims might
be doubted, so he decided to demonstrate in
advance of his request to purchase, that his
“ True Hair Grower” will not only stop hair
losses and permanently cure dandruff, but
will actually grow hair where latent hair
roots exist.
All you have to do is to send a sixpenny
stamp for a large trial box. It comes to you
postpaid by return.
In one of his circulars to prospective
customers he says “ I AM A BUSINESS
MAN, and can frankly state I am not con-
ducting a charitable enterprise.” “ I KNOW
what my preparation will do and will send
you a Large Trial Box for 6d. only to let you
prove it for yourself. When ytfu are satisfied
by using the Large Trial Box, th at it will do
all I say, I will be pleased to supply you with
a further quantity at a moderate price.”

“ Huffin-Guffin’s ” kitchen
We lately moved into one of those single-fronted, one-
eved-looking suburban homes. The box-like rooms are
one behind the other, with doors to each leaoing off the
streak of passage. On either side of us along our street
are other rooms similarly placed, with only a wall be-
tween but it is about our kitchen that I want to write.
It is a fearful and wonderful example of economy in space.
The two doors are opposite each other. There is no room
to open both at once. There is no room for either to be
open if anybody is in the kitchen. The kitchen table
is close to all the walls, but it is closer to
one than to the others. By getting side-on we
can pass between it and three of the walls. A chair is at
one end of the table, with the seat under the table. We
climb on to the table, pull out the chair a few inches, and
then slide down into it. The only place for the dresser,
containing crockery, etc., is in front of the fireplace. If the
fire gets big enough to be any real use, we have to pour
water over the dresser to suppress the combustion.
When one of us gets into the kitchen to light the morn-
ing fire, the rest must keep out until the fire-lighter
backs into the yard or else burns to death. At the same
time the person who gets first into the kitchen runs the
least risk of being fatally crowded, for he has the window
to escape by, and though it is a small window it is
larger than the door. The last into the kitchen
is always the first out, unless the escape is made by the
window. There is no room for two to pass by the door.
Sometimes a jam occurs. Then the window has to be
opened to let one through. We can’t have a large joint
of meat. The fire required to cook it would burn the
dresser in spite of all the water we pour over it, even if
there was room for so much meat. We have chops or
steak cut thin, or sausages flattened out. We can’t get
the kitchen enlarged. To do so, some of the dining-
room (already too small) would have to be stolen. Or else
the back of the chimney would have to hang out on the
right-of-way. Then the milkman couldn’t get along with
our chalk-and-water. So we will have to manage. I wish
some of those big landholders with their thousands of acres
to spread about upon had to live in a crowded subui ban
residential area for a while. It would do them good to
have to crawl under the bed to give their wife room to
put on her corset what time the morning sun makes a radi-
ance on the boot factory opposite, or to stand out in the
right-of-way while the children file past to school. ... I
hear smothered sounds in the kitchen. I am always
warning the family about getting out there all at once.
I must go and see about it.
Now it is the Conservative old Tasmanian
Post that prints this from a Shanghai correspon-
dent :
One has a very different opinion here of Japs than is
held (by some) in Australia. . . . Instead of calling them
our noble allies we call them our treacherous allies.
And a returned Maorilander tells one of his
papers:—
There is precious little disinterested love for England
in Japan. The people of Hong Kong are s mply furious
at the thought of the alliance. The Englishmen in Japan
are as much foreigners as any other Europeans. The Japs
are much disliked, and the Germans speak of them as
robbers, cheats and spies. Everywhere outside Japan
they have a bad name.
Since he got swelled head, it is hard to find as
much as one man who has looked in upon the
Monkey at home and come away with a decent
word to say for him.

A REALLY NICE PRESENT
f.HERE are several points of superiority
about this Keyless Electric Clock. The
chain and weight movement is much more
reliable than any spring mechanism, there is no
danger of a broken spring, the winding is done in
a moment by merely pulling up the weight by the
chain. If you want to see the time during the
night, you have simply to press the button and
the brilliant Incandescent Light illuminates the
face of the clock. The figures and the hands are
• white, and thus show out clearly and distinctly
on the dark background of the prettily embossed
case. You must not think that this clock is in-
ferior because it is so cheap. We guarantee it to
keep excellent time.

Suffered for a Long Time Without
Relief—Had Three Doctors and
Derived No Benefit—One Doctor
Was Afraid to Touch Them
Soreness Disappeared and Hands
Now Smooth After Application of
CUTICURA SOAP AND
CUTICURA OINTMENT
“For a long time I suffered with
sores on the hands which were itching,
painful, and disagreeable. I had three
doctors and derived no benefit from
any of them. One doctor said he was
afraid to touch my hands, so you
must know how bad they were; an-
other said I never could be cured; and
the third said the sores were caused
by the dipping of my hands in water
in the dye-house where I work. I
6aw in the papers about the wonderful
cures of the Cuticura Remedies and
procured some of the Cuticura Soap
and Cuticura Ointment. In three
days after _ the application of the
Cuticura Ointment my hands began
to peel and were better. The sore-
ness disappeared, and they are now
smooth and clean, and I am still
working in the dye-house.
“I strongly recommend Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment to any
one with sore hands, and I hope that
this letter will be the means of help-
ing other sufferers. Mrs. A. E. Maurer,

r MOTHER 1
Seigels Syrup
The world-wide popularity of Mother
Seigel s Syrup is based on the recommend-
ation of countless thousands of men and
women whom it has cured of indigestion,
biliousness, constipation, headaches, dizzi-
ness, sleeplessness, flatulence, nervous de-
pression, anaemia, general debility and
various disorders of the stomach, liver and
kidneys.
Compounded of roots and herbs, Mother
Seigel’s Syrup contains digestive stimulants
and tonics for the stomach, liver and kidneys
that render it invaluable to all who by
reason of sedentary occupation, worry,
overwork _ or. climatic changes, lack the
vigour, vitality and strength which can
alone be obtained from good food, well
digested.
Cures CONSTIPATION
“ I was very constipated, and though I took the usual purgatives they only gave temporary
relief. Soon I was as bad as ever, if not worse. Medical treatment quite failed, but Mother
Seigel’s Syrup cured me thoroughly.”—From Mrs. J. Johnson, 2, Cathedral Place, Woolloomooloo,
Sydney, New South Wales. November 23rd, 1903.
BILIOUSNESS
“After a restless night I would commence my day’s work with a bad headache, and a sick
bilious feeling. Breakfast was a mere pretence, and I felt so weak and drowsy that after an
hour’s work 1 would have to leave off and rest. I went quite dizzy at times, while my eyesight
became so dim that I could hardly see. Mother Seigel’s Syrup alone cured me.”—From

WARNER’S SAFE CURL
• I
Why it cures disorders so seemingly different in character as
Rheumatism
Gout
Neuralgia
Backache
Sciatica
Indigestion
Anaemia
Blood Disorders
Biliousness
Jaundice
Gravel
Stone
Bladder Troubles
General Debility
Sick Headache
This is a fairly long list of disorders, but every one of them ist caused by defective action of the
KIDNEYS AND LIVER.
When the kidneys and liver are working perfectly, it is impossible for anyone to suffer from an;'
of the disorders named. In order that this important fact may be realised, the following description
of the work performed by those vital organs is given :
The Kidneys filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine every day. In this
quantity of urine are dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains in weight of uric acid,
together with other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce.
When the kidneys are in health, all this solid matter is in solution and is invisible. Directly the
kidneys, through either weakness or disease, become unfit to do their duty properly, a proportion
of the solid matter remains in the blood, becomes actively poisonous, and causes us to suffer from uric
disorders such as Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Gravel,
Stone, Bladder Troubles, and Bright’s Disease. A simple test to make as to the condition of
the kidneys is to place some urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and let it
stand until next morning. If it is then cloudy, or there is a brick-dust like sediment, or if particles
float about in it, or it is of an unnatural color, the kidneys are not healthy and no time must be lost
in adopting remedial measures, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some less serious but more painful
illness will result. ;
The Liver. —In the liver various substances are actually made from the blood. Two or three
pounds of bile are thus made from the blood every day. The liver takes sugar from the blood, converts
it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it to the blood gradually, as the
latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble, into urea, which is com-
pletely soluble, and the liver also deals with blood corpuscles which have lived their life and are use-
ful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from Indigestion, Biliousness,
Anaemia, Sick Headache, and Blood Disorders.
The health of the liver and of the kidneys is so closely connected that it is almost impossible for
the kidneys to be affected and the liver remain healthy, or vice versa.
It is nearly thirty years since scientific research directed specially to diseases of the kidneys and
liver was rewarded by the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the world as Warner’s
Safe Cure. It was realised, at the outset of the investigation, that it was necessary to find a
curative agent which would act equally upon the kidneys and upon the liver, these organs being so
immediately associated in the work of dealing with the body’s waste material, and after many dis-
appointments, the medicine which possessed the required aotion in the fullest degree was at length
discovered. Warner’s Safe Cure cures all diseases of the kidneys ansi, liver, and, by
restoring their activity,' these vital organs are enabled to rid the body, through the natural channels,
of the urinary and biliary poisons, the presence of which, in the system, are the cause of Rheu-
matism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Blood Disorders, Anaemia, Indigestion,
Biliousness, Jaundice, Sick Headache, Gravel, Stone, Bladder Troubles and General Debility.
Warner’s Safe Cure cures all these disorders simply by removing the cause of the disorder. This is the
reason why cures effected by Warner’s Safe Cure are permanent cures.

hope of recovery was despaired of, will be sent post free, by H. H. Warner and 00., Limited,

The Inky Way.
J. P. Stow, now a P.M. in S. Australia, and one of the
early editors of the Adelaide Advertiser, and about the
best spinner of yarns in those parts, is at 76 reminiscing:
in his old paper. He has just lecalled one of the early
trials of the Register. George Stevenson, who was
private secretary to Governor Hindmarsh, was the
founder of the Register, with Kyffin Thomas as manager
and printer. When Stevenson was bought out of the
concern he left some bad feeling behind him, and when
be went into politics the Register called him “honest
George Stevenson.” Stevenson sued for libel, and got a
verdict; afterwards the Register, which was bitter in
those days, used to refer to him as the Mr. Stevenson
whom a jury of twelve had decided that it was a libel to
call an honest man. Stevenson afterwards became city
coroner.

“ Mallarapoonie ”: I write to suggest that the Mel-
bourne Argos—by reason of its hostility to the present
Australian Ministry, and its large weepings about Aus-
tralia’s political fate (the ultimate end of which, it says,
is Sosh —the tiling' Reid alleges is a tiger, liable at any
minute to become a rhinoceros, and when not a rhinoceros
it may be all things, from a cockroach to a screw-wrench),
and on account of the ill-nature it showed over the
Petriana spook, the Six Hatters perversion, and other
small stale fish, besides its condemnatory attitude towards
things Australian in general—should be known in future
as the Narked Cuss.

A recent instalment of a big Australian daily’s serial went
astray at sea, and the yarn had to be suspended. In the
great majority of cases the Saturday serial of Australian
dailies would never be missed. It is printed, not as litera-
ture, but as superstition, tradition and imitation. Some
of the serials bought by Australia’s big dailies are syndi-
cated to hundreds of papers, and cost the Australian pro-
prietor rarely more than 2s. 6d. per column. At these
prices the Australian writer has no chance —the proprietor
keeps up the farce of “literary enterprise” by buying a
fairly well known name from oversea, and, at the same
time, pays six or seven per cent, of the figure the local
fiction-merchant would have to demand, else he couldn’t
live.

A couple of notorious “ rag-planters” have invaded the
muddy township of Taihape, on the Main Trunk Line of
Northern Maoriland, and the wordy warfare is persistent
and impure. Thus does Biotts of one paper see Lurk of the
other in his mind’s eye : “We can picture to ourselves the
bei.o figure of an old disappointed man, grasping in his
dingy fingers an ungrammatical pen, and scribbling with
the virulence of despair, ever and anon dipping his quill
into a pot containing a sickening concoction of personal
malignancy and bitter invective that is like nothing so
much as an evil-smelling and foully-saturated fungus,
which, when squeezed, exudes drops of vile calumny.”

Melbourne pressmen who have the bad luck to be on
the unattached list—there are only about a dozen of
them—are growling bitterly at the niggardliness of the
Melbourne Herald. Ever since good old Sam Winter
died the paper has been bitterly cheap in its treatment
of its space staff. Work is given out at per day, and 10s.
is paid for the day’s work even if it runs into several
columns. Men might put up with that, but when, by
extra expedition, a man gets his work finished by 1
o’clock, lie is only allowed to charge for the half-day, and
is paid only ss. The permanent staff has been out down
ti bed rock, and the work is done principally by casuals.
These men turn up at the Herald office in a little gano'-
er ery morning at 9 o’clock. They may be kept waitin'”*
till half-past 10 or 11 without anything happening. Then
probably a voice of authority tells them to come back
after lunch, when jobs will be handed out at ss. each. It
is riot as though the Herald were in low water. On the
contrary, the paper has never, in all its existence, shown
so handsome a profit as it does now. But the taste of
dividends has caused an appetite for more, a id profits
are pursued wolfishly. What the Herald wants is
opposition. The stuff it publishes, and the style in which
it publishes it, have sunk far beneath the level of the
most ordinary evening journalism. The paper, with its
idiotic headlines and its terrier dog yappishness is
becoming more ridiculous every week. A live opposition
paper, with a smart permanent staff, would stagger the
Herald in a week, and inside a month such a publication
would make “ Kurnell” Reay’s organ wonder which brick
had fallen on it.

“Talking of tricks of trade,” said an orchardist who
had in days gone by run a township newspaper, “ the
biggest shock I ever got was when the local parson come
to me and pointed out how we could each do the other
a real good turn. ‘ You wade in,’ he said ’and attack
Christianity, and I’ll reply to you on Sundays. You
keep me in front and I’ll keep you.’ It was after that I
turned to the orchard business, and now I make up cases
of damaged fruit without a qualm. What happened the
parson ? Well, the last I heard he was a Bishop.”
* * * *
“ B.”: I’m afraid I should degenerate into a vile and
disloyal Republican if I didn’t have the English illustrated
papers to keep me in the right way. A recent Black and
White, for instance, has done me no end of good. It por-
trays a solemn scene—“ His Majesty’s Pet Dog, Handbag
and Hat Being Taken to the Train.” The hat looks
crushed and the dog bored ; but are they not rovalty’s
hound and hat? I rejoice, therefore, to see that their
custodians are fully seized of the importance of their
office. The johnny in charge of the animal even wears an
air of apology to the dog for having him on a string
With the bearer of the hat I can find no fault* he
is walking reverentially with head bowed down just’ like
a bishop what time the choir chants “ Holy Holy Holv ”
Still, I do think he ought to have worn gloves, orcarried
the tile on a golden salver.
THE PURPLE POET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am a patch of purple poppies, crazy-quilt and cranky,
I am a lurid adjective, a comprehensive blanky ;
My cornucopia chariot that rolls thro’ every season
Is chock-a-block with planets and with all things out of
reason.
My wheels are wheeling comets, and tornadoes are my
horses
That reel me round the rainbow and the starry water-
courses ;
I boil my billy on the sun ! With frenzied exultation
I prod each panting Pleiad with my points of exclama-
tion 1
I am a dashing Don Juan, a wicked rake and human,
I’ve swooned upon the heaving breasts of every style of
woman.
The girls I sing are not immured in dim and dusty clois-
ters,
In hansom cabs and motor cars they cry for stout and
oysters.
And they are epics every one—to decorate their bonnets
I weave them wreaths of ballades bright and garlands
gay with sonnets.
And when I weary of their smiles I take my airy car again,
And boil my frantic billy-can upon some blazing star
again.

DID THIS MAN NO GOOD.
This is not a picture of “Before Taking,” and then “After
Taking,” etc., but it depicts a man whose stomach has
brought him to a pitiable stage of emaciation.
DO you suffer from indigestion and constipation ? Is your tongue furred when you
get up in the morning ! Do you have pains and a fullness after meals ? Do you
feel dizzy when stooping over? Does your liver bother you? Do you have
pains in your abdomen about an hour before meals?
All these symptoms or one or more of the n indicate that your digestive organs
are weak and out of order. They are indications that should cause you considerable
alarm and induce you to seek immediate relief. They are symptoms that, if they are
not looked to and removed, will cause you great and prolonged agony often resulting in
sudden death.
They exist because your organs are weak in nerve force. Some abuse of your
stomach has crippled its digestive power and you must get rid of the weakness.
’s Electric Belt
corrects the action of the stomach. It gives tone and strength to the tissues, developes
the latent energies, increases the flow of gastric juices and forces the stomach to properly
assimilate the food. In th'i way, by restoring the nerve life that has been lost, Dr.
McLaughlin’s Electric Belt wiil cure any case of indigestion, and by correcting the
action of the liver, any case of constipation that ever existed. It is guaranteed in every
case undertaken.
It will euro all Functional Ailments which are
simply the results of a Loss of Vital Nerve Force,
Weak Back, Nervousness, Varicocele, Kidney and
Bladder Troubles, Insomnia, Sciatica, Rheumat-
ism. A trial is never regretted.
MR. A. S. JOKES, c? CROW MOUNTAIN, writes : “ For many years I tried all sorts
of remedi33 for indigcstior. P was so badly run down that life was a misery.
Though drugs had faiieci to cure nia, your Belt cured me entirely in a few months,
[lot only of indigestion, but debiiity and nervousness as well. A friend who had been
cured by it induced me to try it. 1 always recommend it to my friends.”

Victoria has learned that the lunatic at
large is a more frequent person in its midst than
it dreamed of. According to the last report of
the Lunacy Department, it is the practice to
“board out,” on the State-children principle,
lunatics from the asylums—at time of the report
there were 13 male and 18 female patients living
with private families. The State pays 6s. per
head for maintenance, and as nobody is likely to
keep an able-bodied lunatic idling about his pre-
mises for Os. perweek, it followsthat theable-bodied
lunatic has to graft—and does so. That’s what
the private family has the lunatic there for. As
Dr. Jones, of the Department, puts it, “The
system appears to be regarded as one way out of
the servant-girl problem. ’’ There are some
pleasant possibilities about the “boarding-out
idea—in fact, a vision of loony Mary Ann drifting
about all day in the kitchen among carving
knives, or deranged i'homas whirling an axe at
the wood-heap, opens up a whole herd of possi-
bilities. But probably the deranged and unpaid
slave is too tired and hard-driven to have the
energy to turn on the kind family with a lethal
weapon.
Things are moving a little. Nestle’s milk
people, who make cow-fluid into a sweet tinned

feathers in A. Deakin’s cap.

“Vulcan : Blither Adelaide’s collective citizen
carries his holiness even to the length of consistent
honesty, or the local tax-collector is an extra hustler.
Anyway, the City of Frequent Church proudly boasts
that for the past eight years, including 1906, it has col-
lected the whole of its rates, amounting' to over £40,000 a
year. Well, that is a record to be proud of. I know of
an alleged Sydney taxpayer who consistently hasn’t been
one for over three years, and have heard of others who
openly boast of having dodged their municipal obliga-
tions even longer. Who’s responsible for this tenderly-
discriminating tax-gathering? And in what direction
does the discrimination mostly discriminate?

Last King’s Birthday, a party hired a trap from
a Sydney firm of undertakers and livery-stable keepers.
In the course of the proceedings the firm’s driver upset
the whole concern over an embankment, and several of
the party were much shocked and bruised, and lost con-
siderable nose blood. Later one of them went to settle
the hire bill, and suggested in a humble way that the
firm, in view of the damages its driver had caused, should
make some concession. “Oh, we could not do that”
said the firm, “ although, of course, if anybody had been
killed, we should have made a substantial reduction on
the funeral !”
‘‘Nux Vomica”: Re “N.M.B.’s” par. (B.
15/11/’O6) anent the selling' of methylated spirit to
boozers. It is true —I have had experience of the same
thing, but did not drop to the dodge for a long time.
One old chap used to come in regularly on Sunday morn-
ings, about 11.30, and get his pint, and not until he had
stopped getting it did I learn where it had been put.
It was no use remonstrating with him then ; he was dead.
Several cases have come under my notice of men holding
good billets in Sydney who were fired for absorbing both
rectified (i.e., 90 per cent.) and methvlated spirit—in
most cases they were fired on account of the methy-
lated article. That gruesome stuff, which smells of paint
and tastes like the swallowing of a newly-varnished
hearse, has a fascination for a small class of degenerates,
just as whale oil has it devotees and kerosene rouses a
gleam of enthusiasm in some few faded eves.

“D.”: A few weeks ago I was walking along the
South Melbourne beach when my attention was drawn to
a fisherman standing on the footpath. He was bare-
footed and still wet with salt water and w’hite with brine,
and he had his trousers rolled up to the knee. “ Here
y’are ! Fresh outer the water.” He had a basket of fish
at his feet. He looked cold and forlorn, and a great pity
welled up in my heart. I asked him to come over to
O’Brien’s and wet himself with something better than
salt water. He came. “ Pretty cold standing over there,
isn’t it ? ” I asked, when W'e were safely in the bar. “ 1
don’t mind the cold,” he said, “but it spoils bus’ness.
I’ve on’y sold sixpen’orth, and I’ve bin standin’ there
more ’n a hour.” I felt the pity coming on again, and
fought against it; hut it beat me. “How d’ye sell
them ? ” I asked, looking into the basket.' He
looked at me in a calculating way before he
spoke. At last he said, confidentially': “ Look ’ere,
young feller, I believe yer a decent cove, in spite of y< r
looks, an’ I’ll tell yer a secret.” He pointed to his bare
feet and legs. “ This is on’y kid,” he said. He pointed
to the basket. “Them fish ain’t just outer the water at
all. I bought ’em at the Fish Market this mornin’, an’ I
bin ’awkin’ ’em all day. I often come down’ere of er
night to finish ’em up. People from the northern suburbs
snap at ’em quick, as a rule ; but these cold nights is
killin’ on trade.” Has truth quite vanished out of the
world ?

“Albert D.”: Have noticed the number of
small, tired boys who flock into the big city banks, at the
week’s end, to cash the wages cheque. Some carry bags,
others merely stuff the bullion into their trousers pockets
aud stroll back to the office. Last Saturday, at 11
a.m., I saw a cigarette-faced nipper weighing about
4st. 61b. staggering from the Union Bank, Pitl-street,
Sydney, his pockets bulging with coin. A breath
of air or a well- irected sneeze would have brought
about his physical collapse. In most city offices,
on Saturday morning, amid the horrible jangle of
telephones and the strenuous desire to catch the
picnic-boat or motor-launch, it is usually the smallest
boy who is sent to bring the wages from the
bank. In London or New York the well-posted bank
spielers would certainly nobble that boy. At Manchester,
some years ago, a nipper returning from the bank with the
wag-es, £l7O in all, ran into a pale, well-dressed kid carrv
ing a cage full of rats and followed by a business-like fox-
terrier. “ Where y’ goin’ ? ” asked the bank boy anxiously.
“ Ah’m goin’ to let the tyke mop up these,” said
the pale boy shaking the cage-full of vermin. There
was a hurried adjournment to a back lane where the dog
got to work in style and filled the gutter with dead rats.
Then a worried-looking man with long arms rushed the
bank boy into a corner and separated him from the £l7O.
Probably the Sydney spieler’s intellect hasn’t grasped the
fact that several thousand pounds are idling around, in
boys’pockets, every Saturday morning, between the Hay-
market and Bridge-street. A small, well-organised crowd
of boys with rats could take a lot of Sydney’s wages for a
walk any time it liked.

A case whereof the moral seems to be that
agreements ought to be kept in cool, secluded places,
and offered for signature only during a holy calm, was
settled by Judge Murray (N.S.W.) lately. A widow, the
mother of a boy who wanted to be a grocer, called at a
Sydney “ business college ” to inquire if the college
could make him anything better. The head of the place
handed her a paper, which the widow thought wasanappli-
cation form, and she signed it. Later, she telephoned to
say that her boy would not go, and in reply got a bill for
£2l, being- four quarters at £5 ss. a quarter. She then
found that she had signed a contract to the effect that
default in one payment made her liable for a year’s fees ;
but there was so much rush and hustle about the whole
business that nobody seems to have been very sure
whether anything was read or explained or understood.
The Judge therefore found for the defendant on all
points, and dismissed the claim against the widow, with
costs.

The motor train is rapidly approaching. In
U.S.A. some of the big companies that have a huge
suburban traffic at stated hours only run engine-drawn
trains when the crush is on. The rest of the day the
traffic is carried on by motor carriages, many of which
are, since Roosevelt knocked off the excise on industrial
alcohol, driven by spirit engines. The cars are sharp
prowed, like boats, and fitted with round port-hole-like
windows in front ; they have side entrances, and brakes
operated by compressed air. Each car carries 75 people,
and can attain a speed of 53 miles an hour if required.
As hill-climbers they are said to be wonders. This sort
of craft ought to recommend itself for Sydney’s North
Shore line.

“Hypo”: I visited the Mint the other day.
There gold is plentiful enough to satisfy the most con-
firmed mono-metallist. Gold being boiled in pots, like
boarding-house soup ; gold in wedges, like those with
which splitters burst up big logs (only worth £l5OO each
instead of 25.) ; gold in long, flat bars, which workmen
were filing up, as blacksmiths file horseshoes (I tried to
catch some filings in my clothes, but couldn’t) ; gold in
laths, like hoop-iron from round bales of cornsacks or
wool-packs (only golden color); “scrap” gold, like the
remains of my wife’s rolled-out pastry after she has
cut the biscuits out of it ; and gold with the
all too unfamiliar portrait of King Edward thereon.
I was given a canvas bag containing 3000 soys, to lift. I
could have carried it away quite easily, but I didn’t. The
Mint is worth seeing. And the authorities there are
humorous dogs. A notice on my card of admission read :
“ Visitors are particularly requested not to interfere with
the workmen in the performance of their duties ” (a polite
hint not to knock one down and take bispot of boiling-
gold, 1 suppose). And the card also told me on no
account to offer money to any person. Fancy offering 3d.
to Croesus, so that he could get a lengthy beer.

“ Wyung ” tells a story of a Private Enterprise
hole : In one of the Melbourne tramway engine-houses
there is standing a large solid monument to official
“dunno.” One day a Deputy Ross of the engineering
department happened into the engine house and found the
Chief Attendant making mental calculations as to when
it would be time to go home. The Deputy Boss looked
around ; then he woke the calculator up, led him to the
spare “ heater,” a thing like a great boiler stood on end,
into which the waste steam passes from the engine and
heats the feed water before it goes into the boilers. “It
is a long while since these things were put up,” said the
Deputy Boss, “and I think we ought to see what they’re
like inside. You’d better cut a manhole —about here.
Send the dimensions to the car factory, and they’ll make
you a cover for it.” It took three solid weeks to chop
that hole in the §in. steel and to fit the door to it; and
when it w'as done there was nothing to be seen inside
but dark experiences, as might have been expected.
Still, the Deputy Boss was very pleased with the result,
and said he would have manhole doors cut in all heaters
in his charge. It was very necessary, he said, and he was
surprised that nobody had thought of manholes before.
By-and-bye the engine person turned from contemplating
his work and feeling that it was good, to see the <>reaser
grinning all over his oily face into his skull hat. He
wanted to know why. For reply the greaser made up to
the Deputy Boss and asked him, very respectfully, where
the necessity was for two manholes in one heater. The
Deputy Boss had forgotten to look round the other side
of the heater! I know about it, because I was the
greaser. But up till now- the story of that extra,

This is written by a man who has had 20 years’
experience in “ the trade,” and shows what a great thing
it is for a city to depend upon the importing of calico and
ribbon:—
I have been in Sydney for some months, seeking a
situation m the rag line. First thing, bought a Herald
and read the “Wanted” column. Found—“ Wanted, a
first-class Carpet Hand.” Arrived at 9 o’clock ;
there were 18 to 20 waiting. Punctually at 10
o’clock the boss arrived. You enter the sanc-
tum and bow ; then produce your references—
they are seldom read, but you have to produce them,
even if you make them up yourself. After this, state
your name, your age (woe if you are over 25), married
(for Heaven’s sake, say No); your address. It really does
not matter what you say, because the next thing is,
“Call again.” You call again. “Very sorry, position
filled.” A lie ; there wasn’t any position. There are a
few genuine “ wants,” but in most cases it is nothing but
a business advertisement, a cruel fraud, causing a couple
of dozen hungry work-hunters to dance attendance for a
whole morning, to be swindled and humbugged.
One large firm advertised, “ Wanted two dress hands.”
I was on the spot as early as the proprietors. Met one
outside the office. Told him my business. He replied,
“We don’t want any hands.” I said, “ There was an ad.
in the Herald this morning.” He went into the office
and returned in half a minute. “ The position is filled.”
Another “ business ” ad. Butin this case the left hand
did not know what the right had done.
Another firm advertised for mercers—“ Apply by
letter.” Among the applications were two from two of
the firm’s own men, hoping to better their miserable
pittance. There were two mercers wanted next week—a
genuine ad.
I was fool enough to be had by one firm three times.
The same old ad., the same modus operandi up to a
certain stage. But in this particular the swindle was
better worked. One of the lesser lights took the names,
&c., of the applicants. “Very sorry, the manager ill,
call to-morrow’.” You call to-morrow ; the boss is still ill.
Those ads.—“ Wanted, Dress and Manchester Hands
for our Big Sal are very often swindles. This sort of
advertising is done, firstly, with an idea of advertising
the department—making out that the public is rushing
it. Secondly, it is done to test the 1 labor market. Low
wages are offered to see if the bait will be snapped.
Surely to heavens the wages are low' enough now' (single
men 205., married 80s. to 35s ). Thirdly, through advertis-
ing over a noin deplume they test their own employees,
especially managers of departments. They are usually
branded “Confidential.” It is very confidential when
you get an answ'er to your advt. from your own em-
ployees !

“Starr,” who is the mother of a family, writes
from the bush The Bulletin tells of people who don’t
or won’t buy Australian-made goods, and leaves it at that.
Now the plain reason why we out here do not buy Aus-
tralian goods is because we never see them, and don’t
know them. Me don’t know what articles are manufac-
tured in this country, nor w here the factories hang out,
nor what prices should be paid for them. I have always
lived in the bush, or in bush towns, without ever seeing
a city, and am only one of many such, and I have
taken an interest in the labels on the things I
use, and the advertisements for the things I want; but
where are the advertisements of the locally-made goods?
Have used cornflour and maizena for long years
nearly all Scotch makes. They will not thicken up stiff,
and are just like the boiled starch I put the pinnies
through. Tw'o years ago I got some cornflour from a
hawking boat, and found it was made by Matthew Munn
(N.S.W.), and that he had been making it for 50 odd
years , yet that brand has never met m3' e3’es in stores or
papers. It is good cornflour, but it must have come this
way b3' accident, and I’ve not met it again. Then there’s
“ Marrickville tweeds ” —that’s all. Presumably those
tweeds have no money-order address, and no price. They
just transpire. No bush woman of my acquaintance
knows anything of Sydney tweeds, or dress materials
though they do remember that many years ago the
white hawkers used to bring round “ Geelong tweeds
“good stuff,” they say. “ we never see anything like
that material now'.” As for woollen homespuns and
winseys, they are never seen in the bush, and they ought
to be. Some say coffee is grown in Queensland. Mavbe •
it never gets into the bush. Advertisements giving - par-
ticulars of the goods, and where they can be got are
what we bush women want—just in case the local store-
keeper won’t (and he mostly won’t) stock them. The
store person might invest in home-made goods if he knew
where to lay hands upon them. He often tells me he
doesn t know any more than I do.
ANDROMEDA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She is a snared and prisoned thing—
A meek white moth with broken wing.
Life took her heart when it was yet
Too 3 7 oung for grieving or regret,
And slowly tamed his prisoner—
That glowing woman’s heart of her !
She did not guess what Earth could give ;
She did not know she did not live ;
Caught from the Sun in Work’s grey net,
And in a gloomy office set,
Her breast sometimes forgot to sigh—
Some days she hardly missed the sky.
Her dewy gladness dull Work took
To write dead figures in a book ;
And on her high stool, hour by hour,
She sits —a frail and long-stemmed flower !
And the days drag 7, each day the same—
She is so soft a thing to maim !
She, made for love, of love compact
Has half forgot the love she lacked ;
She waits, a harp of slackened strings
One word of love its music brings.
Each hour is but a death she dies :
One hand in hers is Paradise.
And when I kiss her lips at night
She is a pool of still delight,
Her low laugh a triumphant thing,
Her voice a bird on buoyant wing ;
And when I whisper low her name
Her soul is but a shaken flame !
Her soul that dreams it is alive
The grey ghouls take—from nine to five
She adds up figures—who to me
Is a God-given mystery !
They shut her heart in ledgers up—
Her heart that is a thirsty cup !
So long her life has bled and bled,
They pay dead wages to one dead.
Ah, still we chain, our gods to mock,
Andromeda upon her rock !
But that young stifled heart of her—
Unbind me, gods ! her rescuer !

Has the Largest Sale of any Chest Medicine in the World.
Those who have takep this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Its healing power is marvellous. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of
Breathing, Hoarseness, Fain or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it
effects a Complete Cure. If is most comforting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has never been known to exist where "Coughs” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house
should be without it, as, taken at the beginning a dose is generally sufficient, and a Complete Cure is certain.
Beware of Imitations ! The great success of HEARNE’S BRONOHITIS CURE, has induced a number
of unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of
deceiving the simple-minded, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact,
and to request you in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARNE’S and to see that you get i+

THEORIES
ABOUT
FOOD.
ALSO A FEW FACTS ON THE
SAME SUBJECT.
We hear much nowadays about health foods and
hygienic living, about vegetarianism and many other
fads along the same line.
Restaurants may be found in the large cities where
no meat, pastry, or coffee is served, and the food crank
is in his glory, and arguments and theories galore
advanced to prove that meat was never intended foi human stomachs, and
almost make us believe that our sturdy ancestors who lived four-score years in
robust health on roast beef, pork and mutton, must have been giossly ignorant of
the laws of health.
Our forefathers had other things to do than formulate theories about the food
they ate. A warm welcome was extended to any kind from bacon to acoins.
A healthy appetite and common sense are excellent guides to follow in
matters of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits and meats is undoubtedly
the best.
As compared with grains and vegetables, meat furnishes the most nutriment
in a highly concentrated form, and is digested and assimilated more quickly than
vegetables and grains.
Nervous persons, people run down in health and of low vitality, should eat meat
and plenty of it. If the digestion is too feeble at first it may be easily corrected by
the regular use of DR. SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES after each meal.
Two of these excellent Tabules taken after dinner- will digest several thousand
grains of meat, eggs or other animal food in three hours, and no matter how weak the
stomach may be, no trouble will be experienced if a regular practice is mac e
of using DR. SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES, because they supply all
the natural juices of digestion as found in a healthy stomach, and every form
of indigestion will be overcome by their use.
Cheap cathartic medicines, masquerading under the name of dyspepsia cures,
are useless for indigestion, as they have absolutely no effect upon the actual diges
tion of food.
Dyspepsia in all its many forms is simply a failure of the stomach to digest
food, and the sensible way to solve the
question and cure the dyspepsia is to
make daily use at meal time of a pre-
paration like DR. SHELDON’S DIGES-
TIVE TABULES, which is endorsed by
the medical profession and known to con-
tain active digestive principles.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
II the community is to have Gloom, let it be the Perfect
•Gloom, not a muddy, half-and-half sort of Gloom, but the
real, coal-black, infernal Gloom. Then the community
can judge whether it really wants Gloom.—(Bulletin
i5/n/m
WE weary, 0 unctuous brothers,
Ot shifting and semi-toned mist.
And ask for the darkness that smothers
All things with its blackening fist.
Let life be as drab and as dreary
As if it indeed were a ban,
A p.lgrimage, doleful and eerie,
To merciless Judgment, for Man.
Aye, let us have done with half measures,
And throw ourselves prostrate beneath
Black palls, in the hours of our leisures,
With wailings and gnashings of teetli ;
All joys and all levities spurning
As most reprehensible in
Mere fagoted “ brands for the burning,”
Conceived, born and nurtured in sin.
Sing hey for Eternal Damnation
For those who don’t “ do as they’re bid,”
And seek the dour door to Salvation,
Ordained by the prim unc-o’ guid.
Ohase all the smart boats off our waters,
Let trjjun-cars and trains cease to ruu,
And shut Sydney’s gay boys and daughters
Away from their sea and their sun.
Yes, cram into dismal tin Bethels,
Where, groan-laden, giddiness dies,
Our Maudies and Minnies and Ethels—
Dear girls of the gladdening eyes,
Who erstwhile were wont to await us,
In frillsome and whispering skirts,
And talk with us, walk with us, fete us,
The bright little, light little flirts,
Yet who, on our Sainthood’s arrival,
May giggle and ogle no more,
But under the Great Gloom Revival
Must sit in their pews and deplore,
While paintings in soot and sienna,
Are drawn for these innocent ones,
Of Moloch, who waits in Gehenna,
For Earth’s unregenerate sons.
So, finished with sunshine and laughter,
We jettison women and wine.
And balefully boom a Hereafter
Of Wrath, in a shuddering whine ;
As clamorous church-bells are clanging
A dirge in our din-deafened ears,
And long-visaged pastors are banging
On pulpits that float in our tears.
And shall we be nobler and stronger,
Or walk any nearer “ the Light”
When love titillates us no longer
And alcohol may not excite?
When fun and frivolity vanish,
And, sourly and soberly led,
The natural human we banish
To set the sad Prig in his stead ?
Ah, ask your grim pietist yonder,
Your sanctified, smug Pharisee !
And, while they consider it, ponder
On life as they wish it to be.
When, labelled and shrouded and shriven,
Through perfect, ineffable Gloom,
Dumb, herded, as cattle are driven.
We moaninglv march to the Tomb.

TALAFEKAU.
A Woman of the Backblocks.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MRS. THOMPSON pulled herself up
on one elbow to look through the window
of the shanty. Her movement awakened
the baby in the bed beside her, and he threw out
his arms and murmured uneasily. A low parti-
tion, running half-way across, divided the paling
shanty into two rooms, and in the further one a
man walked heavily to and fro.
“Jim,” called Mrs. Thompson, “’ere’s Mr.
Lawson cornin’ up the ’ill for ’is breakfast. You
get it for ’im, old man, do. What with this kid
keepin’ me awake all night, and such ’eavy frosts
in the mornin’s, I’m not goin’ to get up at seven
for a bloomin’ engineer.”
Her husband came round the corner of the
partition, an untidy, loosely-knit man, burnt
brick red by the sun, and with the usual settler’s
slouch.
“I’ll fix ’im up all right,” he said, good-
naturedly. “ I got the kettle boilin’ for tea an’ I
s’pose there’s bacon in the safe.”
He was laying out the clumsy crockery on the
American cloth which covered the kitchen table,
when Lawson stepped over the low threshold.
He was a young civil engineer, making a first
survey for a railway line in the far backblocks of
N.S. Wales. He had outdistanced the remainder
of his camp, and had arranged to breakfast at
Thompson’s until his own cook arrived.
“Mornin’, Mr. Lawson,” called his hostess.
“You must just put up with Jim’s fryin’ y’r
bacon to-day.”
“ That’s all right, Mrs. Thompson,” he called
back. “ Baby been troubling you again ? ”
“ Troublin’! Why if I ’aven’t been awake more
than asleep, what with ’im wantin a drink now
an’ somethin’ else the minute after, and in between
his screechin’ loud enough to wake Jim, an’ that’s
not easy, I can tell yer.”
“’Ere y’ are now,” said her husband, placing
the bacon and brown tea-pot on the table, “ an’
there’s the bread, an’ if you’re wantin’
jam, it’s in the tin on the shelf be’ind
yer.” He looked into his wife’s room, ad-
ding—“ Reckon yer can look after the kid an’
dinner, eh, ’Melia? I’m goin’to the creek pad-
dock.”
Lawson, left alone, settled down to eat his
rough breakfast, and began to read his letters.
The rustling of the paper caught Mrs. Thompson’s
ear, and he heard her high-pitched, drawling voice
as she talked on, raising it a little to carry over
the partition.
“ Ye’re a great one for letters,” she said. “’Bin
to the post office on the way through the township,
I expect.”
He admitted that he had.
“ An’ Joe Blane, I reckon he let yer look through
the letters yerself, eh ? ”
“Well, yes, he did,” replied Lawson. “But
then, you see, only my letters came by yesterday’s
mail.”
“That’s all right,” Mrs. Thompson went on.
“’E pretends as’e can read the outsides of’em,
but, lor’, ’e can’t, no more nor I can.”
“Why, didn’t you go to school?” asked Law-
son.
“No, not me. Why, there weren’t no school
’ere in my time.”
“ You might have gone to Toolliwongi,” he
suggested, naming the nearest town.
“Lor’,” exclaimed Mrs. Thompson, with a
little laugh, “I ain’t never bin out o’this place.
We ain’t travellin’ kind o’ folk—none o’ my family
are. But,” and her voice expressed some pride,
“ I ’ad an aunt as was in Toolliwongi once. I’ll
tell yer ’ow she came to go while yer eat up yer
breakfast.
“ Yer see, Mister,” she began, “my aunt Mary
was a fine-lookin’ girl. She wasn’t one o’ the
scraggy sort, like I was before I married Jim, but
she was always big an’ fat, an’ she ’ad nice curly
black ’air an’ red-colored cheeks. When she was
dressed fine in yaller or red she looked just gran’.
Any’ow, that’s what the folks roun’ ’ere say.
“ Wal, there come up ’ere a young chap they
called Bill Smith. ’E was one of them travellin’
fellers, with a waggon-full o’ fancy flower-seeds,
an’ books, an’ potted stuffs. ’E called hisself a
‘agent,’ and cut a pretty dash in these parts.
Aunt Mary was the prettiest o’ the girls, an’ soon
they began to sweetheart each other.
“ Next time ’e come, ’e was to bring the weddin’
clothes —an’, sure ’nough, ’e did. They say as
they was good—one o’ everythin’, an’ lace on ’em,
and one red dress, an’ one yaller with black rib-
bons. ’Er father ’ad the Creek Farm then, an’
was reckoned a warm man in the township, but
when ’e saw the clothes, ’e thought the match
good enough even for ’is daughter. Everythin’
seemed reg’lar, an’ they was to be married afore
’e left.”
Mrs. Thompson ceased speaking, and the bed
creaked as she set her feet to the ground and got
out of it.
“I’ll tell yer the rest,” she said, “while I’m
getting my clothes on.”
“Why,” said Lawson, “I thought that must
be the end. And so they were married, and lived
happily ever after.”
“ An’ that they didn’t,” said Mrs. Thompson,
with decisive emphasis. “She was never
married, and when she went to Toolliwongi! it was
to go to the Sessions, an’ ’twas the police as
fetched her. Mr. Jones, it was,” she inserted
parenthetically, “the mounted policeman for
this district, an’ ’e died of apoplexy the year
Creek Farm ’ouse was burnt in the bush fires —
big, red-faced man ’e was. But as to my Aunt
M ar y—it was for a murder—a murder with ’er
own. ’ands.” The colloquial tone made Lawson
shudder. “They wasn’t married,” continued
Mrs. Thompson. “No, an’ ’e went away again
an’ took the clothes with ’im. I s’pose ’e’d s'ei n
some other girl ’e fancied. It wasn’t long before
Aunt Mary’s baby was born —a boy, same as
mine. Most o’ my family ’as boys. ’E was a
sickly little chap, bein’ born in the middle o’
summer, an’ a very ’ot summer, too. Wal, the
neighbors made fun o’ it, an’ she couldn’t stan’ it.
Yer see, she’d bin used to bein’ the belle o’ this
district an’ it come ’ard to be poked fun at. But
’er father, ’e didn’t think it funny—not ’e. ’E
was a nasty-tempered man, an’ ’e made a lot o’
fuss. In the end she drowned’im down in the
creek —the baby, not ’er father. ’E’d ’a’ bin a
nice ’andful. D’yer know the steppin' stones at
the foot of the ’ill where the cows go to water ?
’Aven’t yer bin there? Wal, that’s where it
’appened.
“Some’ow the police ’eard of it. P’raps 'er
father told ’em. ’E was a queer sort o’ old chap,
very mean an’ back-’itting. Wal, they come an’
took ’er to Toolliwongi to be tried.”
At that moment the baby began crying, and the
narrative was interrupted while Mrs. Thompson
lulled him by singing, “Onward, Christian
Soldiers.” When there was quiet again Lawson
asked if the young mother had been hanged.
“No,” said Mrs. Thompson, with what seemed
to be a feeling of regret. “No, she wasn’t ’ung.”
She came to the end of the partition with her
baby on her arm and leant against the wall for a
few minutes, taking up the story again.
“No, none o’ my folk ’ave bin ’ung, not as I
remember. They said she was young an’ ignorant
—somethin’ o’ that sort. Any’ow, they found a
way to let ’er off, an’ she just stayed in gaol down
in the town. So yer see, Aunt Mary saw a deal
o’ city life one way an’ ’nother.”
She turned back to the bedroom and continued
talking while she put up her hair. Her words
came still more slowly, muffled by the hairpins
held in her mouth. “ She never came back ’ere
again. She said she was ashamed, but I’ve often
thought it was more like she got too towny livin’
up in those parts. I dessay she'd ’a’ looked down
"on us if she ’ad.” Mrs. Thompson slipped in the
last pin rather crossly, and came out into the
kitchen fully dressed at last. She was a tall,
stout woman, sallow and sun-tanned, with lines
already showing round mouth and eyes, although
she was still under thirty. Her unbrushed hair
was pinned up roughly ; her bodice, of some dark
stuff, was unfastened at the neck ; her shoes were
trodden down at the heel. The baby at her
shoulder—a happy little infant —was dressed in
faded red flannelette, and had a little stringless
bonnet on his head.
“I’ll leave the washin’-up, Mr. Lawson, ’an
come a bit o’ the wav with yer,” suggested Mrs.
Thompson. “Just wait, and I’ll get my sun-
bonnet.” She took up a great shapeless head-
covering ot washed-out pink, and strolled to the
door. Outside the frost was melting under the
heat of the sun.
Lawson excused himself on the ground of
getting to his work at once, and Mrs. Thompson
continued amiably : “ Wal, I thought p’raps ye’d
’a’ liked to go down by the creek and see the
place where Aunt Mary drowned the baby. But
I’ll show yer another time. There ain’t much to
see roun’ about ’ere, an’ may be, it bein’ in the
family like, Ido think too much on it. Ye’ll be
in ter-morrer, Mr. Lawson, won’t yer now ? An’
Jim’ll carry them machine things for yer if ye’ll
just give ’im a call. ’E ain’t special busy, an’ ’e’ll
like to give yer a ’and. Wal, s’long. Just ’ear
this young ’un ’owlin’ fer ’is breakfast 1 ”

So quiet is
kidney disease
in its approach
that it is often
mistaken for
some other
complaint. The
woman who is
tired all the day,
sleepless the
night through;
who is anaemic,
irritable, ner-
vous, who suf-
fers from dizzy
spells, rheuma-
tism, headache;
whose eyelids
are puffy and
swollen puts
down her
trouble to some
female com-
plaint instead
of to the real
cause —T HE
K IDNE YS.
The man whose
back is weak,
whose limbs
drag, who has
distressing urinary troubles, dropsy, gravel—he never sus-
pects his kidneys, which are the real cause of his illness.
This is why kidney disease is so serious and so generally
fatal. If YOU don’t feel as well as you ought, DO NOT
NEGLECT YOUR KIDNEYS ANOTHER DAY. Be-
cause our neighbors—Sydney men and women —tell so
earnestly and sincerely how Doan’s Pills have cured them.
A SYDNEY MAN’S TESTIMONY.
“Doan's Pills completely cured me of Backache.”
Mr. C. Wickes, Waiwera, Wardell-road, Petersham, this city, says:—
“ Some months ago I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills for pains in the
small of my back, and this medicine cured me. The first two boxes did me
no good ; but a friend who had used them persuaded me to go on with the
treatment. lam glad I did so, for a few more boxes completely cured me.
The backache was worse when I moved about; it would very often leave
me when I rested. Previous to using Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills I had
used many remedies without obtaining the slightest relief.”

Pills are sold by all Chem-
ists and Storekeepers at 2s

DOAN’S OINTMENT.
Any person takes serious chances in
neglecting an attack of piles. This ailment
has a tendency to become chronic, and there
is also a further tendency to ulceration and
forming of fistula, which we know are most
difficult to cure.
The safest remedy for any form of piles,
whether itching or protruding, is Doan’s
Ointment. In using it there is no detention
from daily occupation, and the many cures
made by it have made it famous in every
corner of the world. Any chemist will tell
you that it enjoys a greater demand and
more enthusiastic popularity than any othaf
pile remedy ever placed on the market.
Mr. Joseph Holland, 222 Cleveland-street,
city, states :—“The advertisement that is
published from time to time in Sydney
papers to the effect that Doan’s Ointment
cured me of itching piles is quite true.
Before I used Doan’s Ointment I thought
I would never get a remedy to do me any
good. I had them for seven years, and they
caused me intense pain, and a most teasing
irritation. It is two years ago since I made
the statement, and, if Doan’s Ointment
wasn’t a real good thing I would have had
some return of the trouble —instead I am as
free of Itching Piles as when I made the
statement. Doan’s Ointment took all the
venom out of the trouble these couple of
years. It is a marvellous Ointment. Any-
body may rely on it giving absolute ease.”
It cannot be repeated too often that Doan’s
Ointment will cure Itching Piles. It will
cure them absolutely. But do not take the
manufacturer’s word for this, ask Mr. Hol-
land. He knows, for it cured him, and he
lives here in Sydney. Is not that the best
possible kind of proof? Could there be better?
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d.
per pot, or will be posted on receipt of price by Foster-McClellan Co.,

REMEMBER THE NAME—DOAN’S.
The Cliques of the Who’ll-
Get -In.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CACKLE of women of either sex—of either
sex or none—•
Shriek, and gibber of beings complex, that
Time from the Ooze hath won.
Brainless blockheads, with never a doubt that
theirs are the only ways—
Oh ! but we grimly kept them out, in the stern
old union days.
Selfish “problems” who lust for gold, for “purity,”
or for sin
But the shameless doers of harm untold are the
Cliques of the Who’ll-Get-In.
Society things of the anti-Sosh, with the silly,
empty lie,
Picking the frosted cakes of Bosh (that will hurt
’em by-and-bye).
Society frills to be trifled with, when a Govern-
ment fall seems near,
Used to-day by a Reid or Smith to sweep their
pathways clear ;
Freetrade dames of the Gracious-Me’s, and the
gushing Doodle-Doos—
Darlings that worship the Anything-ese—and the
Anti-Sosh Goo-Goos.
Women-and-Girls-Protection Frights (whose looks
protected too well),
Hating the innocent Out-o’-Nights, when the
stuffy rooms are hell;
Saviours of children who are not lost—hounds
where the frail have trod—
(Leaving a trail by infanticide crossed), who have
none of their own, thank God !
These are the Scares of the healthy life, these are
the ghouls of sin,
These are the tools of “ our chief ” (good Lord !),
and the cliques of the Who'll-Get-In.
There is another (as I’ve heard tell), fair and forty
and fat,
With the purr and the velvet that hide too well
the spit and claw of the cat.
As an angel of Peace and Love she comes, with a
sigh for the human race.
In her heart she would ruin a hundred homes
that her name might take first place.
To Lobby and Office mysteriously she goes where
are barred the thin,
With a purr and a sigh and a veiled false eye—
and the whisper of “Who’ll-Get-In ? ”
With never a thought for their country’s sake
are their selfish bosoms vexed—
But, “ Agent-General ?—who will they make ? ”
and “ Who’ll be Prime Minister next ? ”
They follow to Melbourne and Dowmng-street
with letters from Lord knows who,
With tlie tricks of the harlot for all they meet,
so long as their names get through.
With the wriggle and smile for the big man’s while
wherever “a word’s” to win—
With lecture and screed for the people’s need,
and the whisper of “ Who’ll-Get-In ? ”

HENRY LAWSON.
The Bagmen’s Tour.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CALLIPO DOWNS is an early July
shed, and the night before shearing
started last year the rouseabout hut was
comfortably filled with the contingent of pilgrims
usually found there at that time of the year.
We were a pretty genial crowd just then, for
the cook had been put on that afternoon, and we
had just risen from the first decent meal most of
us had seen for Some months. The only gloomy
faces were those of the men who had missed the
job. A hard-faced, diminutive man was standing
at the fire and discoursing earnestly. This was'
“Squeaker,” ex-jockey and groom, and anything
else you like. A much-travelled man was
“ Squeaker.” He and his mate, Long Paddy
Ryan, hadi arrived only that day “fair on their
uppers,” after walking from Sydney. He was
saying—
“l heard one o’ yous coves say a little while
ago 1 Maoriland for the workin’ man,’ an’ ’e was
a’most cheered for sayin’ it. If you’d ’ad time to
look up from the ’eap o’ bones on yer plates, you’d
’a’ seen that me an’ Paddy ’ere wasn’t ’aving any
Maoriland, for we’ve bin there an’ have just come
back. Ask Paddy.”
Paddy was sitting on his bunk. He arose and
went alongside of “Squeaker.” He was six-feet-
three, and the biggest man in the hut, while his
mate was under five feet. Paddy said : “ I agree
wid all that the little man ses, an’ more, too. It’s
no place for an Australian, annyway. Tell them
all about it, Little-’un.”
“Well, then, me an’ Paddy was thirty quid
strong each when we was in Bourke after last
shearin’, an’ I’d heard a lot in the sheds about
Maoriland, so I ses to ’im one night, ‘ Let’s go
there, Paddy.’ ”
“ An’ bad luck to me, I ses * ves,’ ” said Paddy.
“So we goes ter Sydney an’ buys a brief to
take us ter Dunedin, that bein’ the place a chap
told us was best. No, we didn’t try ter scale the
steamer blokes neither ; they’re too fly, an’ we ’ad
beans. There was nine of them sent back in the
police boat before we left the’Eads, and I was sorry
for ’em, but not ’arf as sorry as I was for myself
after. We got there all right, and then the band
began ter play. We started ter look fer a doss-
’ouse, but they wasn’t ’avin’ any Australians at
any price. At last we goes to a ’ouse which ses,
* Board an’ lodgin’ for single men.’ We went
inside, an’ asked the old party in charge for beds.
She looks at me an’ Paddy an’ then at the swags,
an’ then goes over to the stairs an’ ’oilers out.
‘Mary, is the top flat emp’y?’ Mary ’oilers
back, ‘Yes.’ Then she turns to us, an’, lookin’
me straight in the chiv, ses, ‘Cash in advance,
please.’ I ses, ‘You’re pretty suddent ’ere,
mum, ain’t yer ?’ An’ she ses, ‘We ’ave ter be
with you Australians.’ I had ter be civil, so I
said nothin’ then. Later in the day we went ter
get a cab to ’ave a look round, an’ I asks one
.cabby, ‘ ’Ow much ? ’ He ses, ‘ ’Arf a jim.* I
ses, ‘ 1 don’t want ter buy the thing,’ and ’e ses,
‘ O, I see, you're one o’ those blauky Australians
which lauded to-day. If jou 11 wait tili I nail me
cushions down inside, I’ll take yer for five bob.’
I sooled Paddy on to ’ini, an’ in no time we was
run m, an’ ilex’ day we was hauled before the
beak for be’avin’ rioehusly. The beak arsked the
John who copped us if there was anything known
about us, an’ ’e said, ‘ They’re Australians, yer
wuship,’an’ yer wuship said, "Five pounds ora
month,’an’ was as angry over it as if we was up
for murder.
“ W e got out o' there quick an’ lively, an’ got
inter the country. It was wuss there, even though
we ’ad beans to pay with.”
I dunno why, but tliey wasn’t for thrustin’ us
anny where over there,” said Faddy, sadly.
“ An’at a place called Ashburton, the paper
said one day in big letters, * Two Australians
passed through the town yesterdee, but there’s
nothin' missing.’”
‘‘That’s so,’ said Paddy, “an’ there wasn’,
aither. ’
“It was ‘Cash in advance ’ ever} 7 where. An’
we couldn't get a job any where, on’y flax-cutting,
an’ that’s a job for the scum o the earth. Beans
was gettin’ low, and there was nothin’ before us
but ‘liummin’; an’ I hadn’t ever done much o’
that. We was over too late for the shearin’, or we
might ’a’ done better. We only struck one shed
as was shearin’, and there the tucker was let out
at contraek to the cook, an’ ’e charged us a bob a
feed. That was hard lines if you like. So we
tackled flax-cutting’, an’ I wouldn't do it again
for Father Peter.”
“ I’d sooner blow bladdhers at tuppence a ton,”
said Paddy.
“ We got a few bob outer that job, and we makes
back ter the ‘rattler,’ an’ who should we see there
but ole Scotty that was pennin’ up ’ere last year,
’ini an’’is ole pan-cleaner. ’E was leadin”im on
ter the platform when I spots ’im, an’ I was never
so glad ter see anybody in me life. It seemed
like home, an’ ’e was glad to see us too. ’E
’adn’t done too bad, ’e said, an’ was rnakin’ down
ter Dunedin. We ’ad a few with him, an’ then
he asked us ’ow we stood, an’ I tell yer, chaps, I
nearly wept to ’ear the good old cry, ‘ Are yer
short '! ’ ’E lent us all ’e could spare—three quid
—and with that, we ’ad enough to take one o’ us
to Sydney, and the other as tar as Auckland, on
the way ’oine. You’d never catch a Maorilander
sayin’ to a shed mate, ‘ ’Ow are yer off for stuff ? ’
They’re too civilised there, an’ they go about
throwin’ ’arf-crowns at theirselves for bein’ clean
an’ honest. There's whips o’ churches an’ par-
sons an’ teetotallers, an’, in consequence, they
suspect everybody o’ somethin’ or another.
“Ole Scotty ’ad a few in; an’, when’e went
over to the platform, we went with ’im ter see ’im
safe off. ’E goes to the ticket office, an’ says to
the lardy-dali joker at the winder, ‘Gimme a
ticket for me an’ me dorg for Dundee.’ ‘Hey ? ’
ses ’is nibs. ‘ Gimme a ticket for me an’ me pan-
cleaner for Dundee,’ ses Scotty a second time.
‘ There ain’t no sich blanky place,’ ses the dook,
‘ an’ if yer don’t use better langwidge, I’ll have
yer blanky well run in,’ ’e ses. ‘You aren’t in
Australia now.’ I knoo when I ’eard this that
there was trouble brewin’ for an Australian, so I
told Scotty ter come over to the tote an’ make
sure. We goes over, an’ finds that it was Dunedin
that Scotty meant. I went and apologised to ’is
mbs, an’ told ’im we was poor forrm scum, an’
would ’e excuse Scotty this once; an' so Scotty
got away.
“ Then me an’ Paddy goes to Christchurch, an’
Paddy goes ter the hospital sick. I couldn’ leave
’im there, so I looks about for a job, an’ I ’eard o’
one from the on’y good sort I struck over there.
’E says, * When yer arslc for a job, don’t, for
Gawd’s sake, tell ’im you’re Australian, f’r these
blowed-up snufflers here thinks no one’s any good
but theirselves.’ I goes to the bloke, an’it was a
livery stable, an’ right inter me tommyhawk.
Fust question, ’e asks me where I come frum. I
tole ’im Dunedin. Then ’e asks me for a stiff
tellin’ about my ability with horses. I ses, ‘ Look
at me chiv, an’ if that don’t satisfy yer that I’m
a horsey man, then you’re no judge o’ horses yer-
self.’ 'E looks’ard at me for a bit, an’ses, ‘Ho,
yes, you’ve bin among horses, an’ yer can start in
the mornin’.’ I got on all right for about three
weeks, an’ by that time Paddy was on the mend.
An’ then one day, when I didn’t know that ’e was
about, one o’ the horses played up, an’ I performed
Australian style, an’ called ’im an’ ’is boss blanky
Presbyterians, an’ sich like. Then ’e pops out
from be’ind, an’ ses, ‘ Ho, you are a blasted Aus-
tralian ! ’
“ I sez, ‘ Yes, an’ what about it ?’ An’ then I
thought o’ my mate, an’ I smooged to ’im for
Paddy’s sake, an’ told ’im I ’ad a sick mate in the
hospital. But it was no use ; ’e only got worse,
an’ said, ‘ You are a .bloomin’ Australian. Get
out o’ this at once!’ I ses, ‘Gimme a week’s
notice,’ an’’e puts’is’and in’is kick in a’urry,
an’ ses, ‘Get off the premises at once,’ an’ ands
me a week’s screw. 1 went. Then me an’ Paddy
takes the steamer goin’ back to Auckland ; that
would leave us so much nearer ’ome, at the worst.
When we was on the trip, I useter ’elp the
stooard, an’ got a few points about the boat,
which stood me in after. When we gets ter
Auckland, we ’ad just enough to pay for one
ticket to Sydney, an’ a few bob over. Paddy
wanted to give it to me, an’ I swung for ’is jaw,
an’ if ’e ’adn’t ducked, ’e’d ’a’ gone out.”
Paddy looked down affectionately at Squeaker
ah’ said, “He is the brave man although he’s
little, but wait an’ listen, an’ ye’ll hear some-
thin’.”
“Paddy was for sellin’ the swags, but they was
worth very little more than they are now, an’
that’s not much, an’ then I thought o’ somethin’,
an’ ” ——
“We did it,” said Paddy, triumphantly. “I
put the diver little devil in the swags, an’
sthrapped him up, an’ bought a ticket, an’ carried
him aboard the stamer aisily. The man at the
gangway said, ‘Ye’ve a wondherful big swag.’
‘Yis,’lses, ses I, ‘’owin’ to yeer bad laws, ye
arre dhrivin’ capital out o’ the counthry.’ An’ I
showed him me pass an’ got on board. What
d’ye think o’ that, now?”
“ I wasn’t safe even then,” said the Squeaker,
taking up the parable, “ not till the tickets were
taken up. I went an’ ’ad a look around after
Paddy unstrapped me, an’ after we gets to sea I
went an’ planted under the calico that’s round the
fresh beef bangin’ near the butcher’s shop; so,
when the purser mustered the steerage passengers
near the meat, I was bangin’ to the ’ook like a
shin o’ beef. An’ when I gets the office that all
was right, I gets down, an’ finds myself as greasy
as a drover’s cook. An’ when I sees the red roofs
o’ Sydney shinin’ through the air like a bush fire,
I nearly cried. Maoriland’s all very well for a
capitalist, but not for an Australian worker.
Why, me an’ Paddy came all the way from Sydney
to ’ere on a quid, an’ didn’t ’um a feed even.
Some day, there’ll be a war between us an’ that
place. An’ I’ll be there. There’s lots o’ poor
Australian blokes which can’t get back, an’ I
think there oughter be a subscription got up to
bring ’em back. Straight wire, an' no funny
business. ”
TABBOY..


impure blood is the cause of very many of the ills to which
flesh is heir. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla purifies, vitalizes and n-
richesthe blood, as testified to by Mr. W. J. Pickering, Store-
keeper, Breeza, N. S. W., who sends his portrait and tells the
following interesting story:
Y>\
“In the year 1890 my ankle
broke out, and I went to a
doctor, who told me 1 was
suffering from blood poison-
ing. He prescribed for me,
but did me no good, and I
tried several other physicians
without benefit. I went into
St. Vincent’s Hospital, Syd-
ney, and, after a few months’
treatment there, came out
worse than ever, feeling
greatly discouraged. I suf-
fered terribly for four years,
until my wife, hearing of
AYER’S 3 arsaparilla
got me a bottle. She persuaded me to give it a thorough trial. Soon
I noticed that the sore on my ankle began to heal, then the pain dimin-
ished, and after a course of six bottles I became as well as ever I was
in my life, and I remain in the best of health.
“ Everybody for miles around here knows what tribulation I went
through. I now recommend Ayer’s Sarsaparilla to all who suffer from
impure blood, and I am glad to say that it has done good to all who
have tried it.”
Be sure you get the original AYER'S Sarsaparilla. See
that the name—AYER’S SARSAPARILLA—is on the wrapper,
and blown in the glass of each bottle.
