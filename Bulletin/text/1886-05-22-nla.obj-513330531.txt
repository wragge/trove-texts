The disclosures in the N.B.W. Parliament
concerning the “Australian Portrait Gal-
lery” and the “History of the Soudan Con-
tingent” once more prove the pressing
necessity of putting some effectual check
upon the disbursement of public monies.
In these cases the sums thrown to the wind
to gratify the mean, miserable ambition of
the party in power, do not astonish by their
magnitude, so much as by the selfish profli-
gacy which they denote, and the immunity of
Ministers from all practical responsibility in
their dealing with the national funds. We
are accustomed to believe that the expend! -
ture of all monies is controlled by Parlia-
ment : here is an instance of payments made,
not only without authority of Parliament,
but certainly against its wish. Yet no one
can say that there is anything positively
illegal, or even unconstitutional in the
action of Ministers in making these pur-
chases, norland this is the important point,
is there any reason whatever why, under
the present system, the Ministry or any of
their successors should not spend money
still more wastefully, selfishly, and foolishly
—if that be in any way possible, and up to a
thousand times the amount. Why should the
House trouble with Estimates for the year
If the Treasurer is allowed to dip into the
public purse to purchase any gew-gaw,
literary or otherwise, that takes his fancy ?
The Act of Appropriation is a solemn farce
while Ministers are able to grab at their
pleasure and with impunity, sums which
the House, unless coerced by the fact of the
money having been already paid, would
certainly refuse to gran f .

Any student of English Constitutional
History knows that it was only their con-
trol of the public monies which enabled the
Commons to maintain and increase their
power in the Commonwealth. The liberty
which we now enjoy was bought not by the
blood of our ancestors, but with their sub-
sidies. Many of our best laws were, as Hal-
lam states, “in the most literal sense ob-
tained by a pecuniary bargain with the
Crown. The sale of redress was chaffered
for as distinctly as the most legitimate busi-
ness between two merchants would be
transacted.” Had Charles I, or Elizabeth,
or Henry VIII been able to raise money
without the authority of Parliament, Eng-
land would at once have been placed under
the rule of a despotism tempered only by
assassination, and, appreciating to the full
the value of their prerogative of finance, the
Commons surrounded that prerogative with
safeguards which to this day prevent the
Monarch or her servants, the Ministers,
from touching a penny that is not already
voted. These safeguards are not noticed in
the written Constitution, and were not in-
troduced here when Responsible Govern-
ment was conceded, and the checks in
the New South Wales system are so
feeble that each successive Premier has
defied the power of Parliament to re-
strain his band in the expenditure of
the public funds. Sir Henry Parkes, when
in power, continually added largely to the
"expenditure without Parliamentary war-
rant. It is only just to him to say that his
purchases, with the exception of those
“works of art,” were always made with
admirable judgment, and have been in nearly
every case magnificent public investments.
'Still, his freedom in making them, and his
independence of the Assembly, show clearly
•enough that Ministers have powers which
should not, under any circumstances, be
allowed to them. The following Ministry,
that of Sir Alexander Stuart, spent
money quite as independently as Sir Henry
had done, not nearly so wisely, and hardly,
perhaps, with the same immunity of sus-
picion. The largest single item of unauthor-
ised expenditure was involved in that
Soudan Expedition which, illegal from its
inception, was a source of infinite loss to the
country, and infinite private gain to the
renown of Ministers responsible for its des-
patch. Had not the Ministry been able to
grab money from the Treasury, without
consent of Parliament, it is exceedingly pro-
bable that this national farce would never
have been placed upon the political stage.
THE LATE MR. HUGH GEORGE.
And, to descend from great things to small,
another instance of the Treasurer s practical
irresponsibility to Parliament is seen in the
subsidising of the precious volumes, “The
Australian Portrait Gallery ” and the “ His-
tory of the Soudan Contingent.” Take the
former first, the “Portrait Gallery.” We
fail to find this volume on sale at the
stationers' shops in Sydney: it does not seem
to be offered to the public. The publishers
seem rather to have depended upon the
Government subsidy to cover the total
cost of publication. The Government
subsidy, for the purchase of 500 copies
can be called by no other name, amounted
to £6OO. Private members were, it is
affirmed by Mr. Young, asked to give £5
each for copies of the precious volume, but,
as against this, they were allowed to write
their own biographies—an invaluable privi-
lege to men of the O’Connor, Dai/lev, and
Buchanan order! Was the difference be-
tween £1 Is. and £5 the precise amount of
extra expense involved in printing a “puff-
ing” rather than a “slating” notice? Or
was a reduction allowed to the Treasurer on
his taking a quantity ? Or was it thought
that the Ministry, being as they are therein
described a set of inspired statesmen, should
have the copies cheap; while the prominent
members of the Opposition, being, as some
of them are therein pourtrayed, a very in-
ferior set of fellows, should have to pay more
for this lovely volume, the “Australian
Portrait Gallery”? Sir Patrick J bnninqs
will have to fence with more than his usual
skill to answer these questions. Then about
the “History of the Soudan Contingent.”
This book so teems with fulsome eulogy of
Plain Bill in particular, and the Stuart
Ministry in general, that one long howl of
derision would have greeted its distribution
in New South Wales. How is this to be
accounted for ? Did the Ministry instruct
Messrs. Myers and Hutchinson to write the
book in this style? If so, the Ministers used
public money to meanly, selfishly, and dis-
honestly gratify their own vanity. If this
was not the case—and we are told by Mr.
Myers, in the Sydney Daily Telegraph,
that it was not —the writers named mus
have erred in their task, with the result tha
the book produced is only fit for distribu
tion in London, where Sir Alexander
Stuart now is, and where the characters o
New South Wales politicians are, fortu-
nately,for the credit of the colony, unknown
It seems impossible that two practised
leader-writers for the daily papers coulc
have blundered so. They had doubtless
written a great deal of leading matter
in support of the expedition and the
Ministry which sent it, and no doubt ex-
pected to write much more both in praise
of the Contingent and the Stuart Cabinet
Possibly they were carried away by their
enthusiasm, generated either by the Contin-
gent or by the £lOO and £l2O which they
received for the work ,
* ♦ »
There is another more important) but les®
glaring, matter in connection with the finan-
cial feats of Mr. Bibbs. It is his trick ol
spending money not included in the Estl-
mates-in-Chief, and then coming down
with so-called Supplementary Estimates of
three-quarters of a million at the end of
the year. These latter were not “Esti-
mates” in any sense of the word. They
were almost entirely lists of amounts paid
in anticipation of the sanction of Parlia-
ment. And the Assembly was obliged to
rote them. It had no alternative. The
money had been nearly all paid away*
nothing remained for members but to as-
sent. Even if the money had been thrown
into the sea, it had gone from the Treasury.
Those who had received it would laugh at
the idea of re-payment. Practically, Mr.
Bibbs, with the consent of the Cabinet, was
the Parliament of the country, for he could
deal with the funds as he chose. There was
no check upon his single will. The Assembly
might spend laborious nights in discussion
of trivial increases, and trumpery grants*
but this was a mere formality. He could
keep out any sum, large or small, from the
Estimates-in-Chief, pay it even while mem-
bers were worrying over items utterly in-
significant in relative importance, and then
show it months after on the supplementary
list—not of sums required, but of amounts
paid. And nothing has since been done to
prevent any Treasurer from doing likewise.
At the present moment while the Assembly
is contemplating unimportant reductions in
departmental votes, Sir Patrice Jennings is
empowered to pay away thousands for any
vicious and wasteful purpose, that a less
careful and conscientious man might select
as a vehicle for extravagance. He might do
this, and nothing need be heard of it until
the Supplementary Estimates are laid on the
table for the mere formality of confirmation
by the Assembly, The plain fact is, that the
Assembly has handed over to the Treasurer
the keys of the Treasury with authority to
scatter national funds in whatever direction
fancy may dictate or self-interest indicate.
* * *
It is time that all this was altered. The
integrity of all past Treasurers and of the
present one may be unimpeachable, but the
future must be provided for. Some Trea-
surer may arise who, pretending land is
wanted for railway purposes, may give
£loVlCO—not for an estate like that which
Sir Henrv Parkes bought at Evelelgb,
worth the amount, but for a block worth
£60,000, and pocket the balance as commis-
sion. Or another Cabinet may desire to let
posterity know of their imagined virtues,
and employ an editor and publisher to pro-
duce a book which shall be as well stocked
with flattering lies about themselves as it is
with libels on their opponents; or, again, a
future Ministry may pay Sydney journalists
immense sums for but little work as an in-
ducement to those writers to bolster up a
Cabinet that deserves to fall. These things
have not yet been done, but there is nothing


except the absence of corrupt Ministers to
prevent their accomplishment. It is bad
enough that the State finances should pass
from the control of Parliament; it is a
thousand times worse that the door should
be left open to the possibility of such cor-
ruption as we have endeavoured to imagine
and describe.
* ■ ■
To find the true method of bringing the
expenditure of all moneys under the direct
and complete control of the Assembly we
must hark back to the source whence our
Parliament was derived~the Parliament of
England. We have already alluded to the
safeguards the House of Commons has de-
vised for protecting its prerogative of appro-
priation. The chief of these is the supervi-
sion of the Exchequer which may best be
understood by this excerpt from Hearn’s
“ Government of England,” descriptive of
the process necessary for the issue of money
from the Home Treasury
“ When the Treasury requires money either for
its own use or that of any department it obtains a
toya! sign manual warrant prepared In a specified
form, and authorising the issue of the required
Sum; and, thereupon, directs to the Exchequer
Certain instruments styled Treasury warrants and
issuing letters. It then becomes the duty of the
Comptroller-General of the Exchequer to ascer-
tain whether Parliament has agreed to the ?ote to
which the royal warrant refers; whether the Bill
for providing Ways and Means applicable to such
a vote has become law, and whether the sign
manual reciting the special purposes of the vote
and not exceeding its amount, the Treasury war-
rant and the Issuing letter are in substance and in
form conformable to law. If he be satisfied that
each of these five indispensable conditions has
been duly fulfilled he then gives his warrant for
the issue of the amount.”
There is in New South Wales no efficient
analogous process. The system here may
be briefly described thus: “ when the
Treasurer wants money for anything
he goes and draws it.” If it is not
to the credit of one fund it may be
procurable from another. At the present
time it is whispered that £109,000 in one lump
has been debited to an account that was
intended for quite another purpose, and
Sib Patrick Jennings proposes to follow
the evil example of his predecessors by
drawing an advance against loan expendi-
ture, presumably from the Consolidated Re-
venue, so as to keep away from the London
money market until the end of the year,
although the general loan fund will be
exhausted within less than two months from
the present, This means that two millions
must be debited and then afterwards
credited to the funds that are in no way
liable for the expenditure. Such political
cooking of accounts* whether for a good or
bad purpose, should not under any imagi-
nable circumstances be permitted. It is an
insult to the House which is called together
to deal with the finances: it is a temptation
to a Treasurer to pervert funds for a more
questionable purpose; and it is an evil ex-
ample for the country. In England, as Hearn
shows) nothing of the kind would be per-
mitted. Mr. Gladstone does not come down
at the close of the year with receipted bills
for services never ordered by the House,
amounting to 10 per cent, of the year’s
expenditure, and causing a deficit cf one-
eighth of the annual revenue, as Mr. Dibbs
did last year. Any unforeseen expenditure
has to be explained by an English Ministry
before payment is made* and credit vote
obtained therefor. The same system must
be adopted here. The Treasurer’s advance
of £loo*ooo must be dispensed with, and a
new department added to the Audit Office
to effectually provide against further mis-
use of Government money. The work of
the Audit Office now is comprised for
all practical purposes in the mere check-
ing of accounts for the discovery of clerical
and technical blunders. Its functions are
retrospective and devoid of regard for the
will of Parliament. The new department
must act prospectively regarding the public
funds to prevent this wastefulness, and
the cooking of public accounts. Then, and
not till then, will the autocrats of office be
prevented from paying extravagant sums
for outrages in art, libels in literature, and
panegyrics in “portrait galleries.”
The Murderer, Liddiard—the Murderer,
Society.
The determination of the New South Wales Exe-
cutive to have the execution of William Lid-
diard, the Warden murderer, carried out, excites
no surprise. All necessary legal formulae were, In
his case, satisfactorily completed. The infamy
that blackened the moral character of the chief
witness for the Crown did not seriously impair the
evidence, for testimony otherwise procured from
18 different sources established the truth of the
self-confessed adulterer’s declarations. Liddiard,
It is admitted, and can hardly be denied, mur-
dered Noonan. The poor beggarly scrambler for
a subsistence on a selector’s little sugar-cane plot
had thought to add to the sunshine of his life by
marrying a woman. To his dull soul brlght t
breathing visions no doubt came. His boor’s in-
tellect, startled from a life of litter, arose above
the price per cwt. of maize or sugar-cane. Love
lived. Dreams reigned. The sodden stupor built
up by years of brutish labour fell away. And the
woman ? Well, what is Warden that it should
escape the curse of Troy ? Liddiarl found that
one of his labourers named Noonan held guilty
intercourse with his wife. He got his gun, he got
his tomahawk. One evening, when the sun was
setting, he chopped Noonan to pieces in the cane-
brake, squeezed the mutilated body into a bag,
forced another labourer to assist him to the river
with the ghastly load, and, rowing along the rip-
pling waters, he dropped his burthen into the deep.
Murder, however, will out. The revenge was
wrought 13 months ago. On the 20th of April last
a jury in the Grafton Assize Court found Lid-
diard guilty, and Acting-Judge Knox passed the
sentence the law directs.
* * *
Liddiard murdered Noonan. Society will now
murder LiddiarU, The distinction supposed to
lie between killing done by a corporation and kill-
ing done by an Individual, is unreal. For matters
of commercial or social value a distinction be-
tween the two tribunals is useful and necessary.
But the opinion of any number of individuals
taken in the mass is only a multiple of the in-
dividual opinion. It is not a different essence.
The fallibility of the individual as to incident, to
sanity, to the right to hang, or to any right,
leavens the sum total of the conclusions of the
mass. A stream does not rise higher than its
source. In ordinary affairs no irreparable injury
springs from taking a corporate opinion as a basis
for action. A rule of averages has play. If under
the corporate opinion a man be unjustly im-
prisoned he possesses the right to a claim for com-
pensation. Inherent fallibility is thus atoned for.
But there are subjects from the determination of
which, according to his own ideas, the individual
is precluded. He cannot kill when he thinks it
right to do so. Now, in such cases, where are we
to look for the principle which gives to a multi
tude of these individuals the right to set aside this
prohibition ? No one can confer that which is not
his. Can, then, the individual who possesses no
right to kill confer the right to kill upon himself
when collected into a society with others? Can
this society which denies to the single members
the right to kill, itself exercise the right? If so,
whence does it derive it? It must be from a source
outside human reason, or from human reason. If
the first, the constitution of modern society cuts
the ground from it. If the second, how has it
purged itself of the fallibility of its component
parts? Again, from the opponents’ side, if we
admit that killing by society is justiflab’e there is
evolved from this general right, conferred by in-
dividuals, the root of the individual right to kill.
Thus, either the individual is dowered to kill, or
society has not the right.
♦ ♦ n
On many subjects there is much thoughtlessness in
the way man makes over his conscience to Society
or the State. In the infancy of our race the prac-
tice was intelligible. In the medioeval ages it was
also intelligible. We had gods, then, over us.
Their voices were in the thunders. They drove
the winds in the midnights, and kindled the
sun in the mornings. Through the white,
wide spaces their hands reached down and guided
us along. We walked from sorrow to joy, and
when at the last we fell asleep we knew soft
fingers would open our eyelids, and that we
would leap transfigured into a realm of
infinite delight. Laws in those years were divine
laws. Ears heard, as the commandments fell, the
beating of an omnipotent heart. What wonder
was it that in such circumstances men cast out
their reason and with uncovered heads rushed to
obey authoritative behests ? Now these gods are
all practically dead. It looks as if for evermore
they shall lie dead. The world is to-day worldly.
It takes sole charge of its own affairs, and, unless
in its scientific results, the business of the infinite
azure does not concern it. What, then, is the pre-
sent relation between man and law ? Law is partly
his creation. Law is a thing he helped to make in
an hour when he was serious, or in an hour when
he was humorous, and so long as it serves his pur-
pose he will observe it. But what is its abstract
value, its eternal significance, its absolute power
to oblige ? What is its eacredness, its sanctity, its
inviolability? It is a fallible issue of fallible
thoughts, a thing in season for a period, but
doomed to extinction as surely as is the source
from which it sprang. Can there, then, a man be
found who, in the plenitude of his intellectual
health, will, after thought like this, hand over his
conscience to a Statute book? Intellectually,
he stands erect before the book ; morally
he stands erect before its makers. He is
awake. In him is power co-equal with their
power—authority to determine what is right,
authority to determine what is wrong. When
through vibrating air commandments fell as from
the lips of Infinitude it was human for him to
crush the head of his reason and to obey. But,
now I Every man’s reason is the judge of the laws
he should obey.
• * *
The surrender of individual conscience to the
State is a characteristic of phlegmatic nations.
There are nations specially phlegmatic when the
interests of humanity at large are at stake that are
not so on any other occasion. Men, vaguely aware
that there are brutality and horror in tearing the
skin from a wretch’s spine, or in hanging him
from an Bft. rope, shrug their shoulders and leave
the question to the authorities. If told that legal
forms have been fulfilled they are fully appeased.
Consequently, ancient barbarisms flourish among
these when they have become almost extinct in all
actively humane nations. No civilised country in
the world has so bloodstained a criminal code ag
New South Wal s. From almost every part of
civilisation the " cat ” hai dropped down into the
slough where penal blunders of barbaric jurists
lie among blood and tears that ought never
to have been shed. Seldom does an ex-
ecution take place in France. The scaffold,
it was cried aloud the other day by the Dibitxo,
no longer exbts for Italians. In Austria, im-
prisonment substantially supersedes the death
penalty. In Belgium imprisonment is the invari-
able substitute. In most of the States of America
imprisonment takes the place of the gallows.
But in N. 8. W. we tlog for everything we take
afancy to, and keep on our register 21 offences*
excluding wilful murder, for any one of which a
man may be ordered to be hanged. Have we
not here evidence that our law-makers bring to
their work consciences made up of the stuff and
B haped in the mould of an old dead time ? They
find no cause for reflection in the fact that the
dripping triangles have been taken down else-
where. Quite undisturbedly they write that
hangings shall go on, although elsewhere exe-
cutions are abandoned as things found to have
produced no good result. To them the whiz of
the whip carries the charm it carried a century
ago. The broken-necked wretch blown by the
wind at the end of a rope is still the lesson he ages
ago was counted. Here the phlegm of the com-
munity assists. Its conscience on human regrets
has been surrendered to the Slate. The outcome
is the perpetuation of barbarity, more blood and
more murder.
* * *
Liddiard’s is a low life, we admit, and at its
going out there will be neither darkening of sun
nor earthquake. But the choking of the soul out
of the grizzly pig-feeder, cattle-tender, and cane-
grower cannot bo effected legally at the end of a
rop swung from a gaol gallows without the mo-
mentous question of the head and front of human
rights forcing a passage through the sick socialities
and political trickeries with which the public mind
is surrounded. The feel of murder is in the air;
of liddiard the murderer, in the first instance*
and of Society the murderer in the second. They
face civilisation: Liddiard with a tomahawk in
his hand in the cane-brake with the evening sun
shining into his red eyes; Society, with ar.peln
its knuckly fist at the foot of the gallows, with the
morning sun rising over the walls of the gaol-
yard; the one the representative of an individual
idea of right, the other the representative of a
corporate idea of right; each finite, fallible;
neither commanding power to undo it* deed in the
wide long halls of the future; neither knowing
anything of the ultimate purposes of our vagrant
existence; of why the earth rolls and the sun,
shines and birds and beasts are alive; or of why a
sad glad heart wan thrust into the keeping of a
short-sighted capricious human intellect. The??,
the representatives cf the individual, and the re-
presentative of the corporate idea of what is right
front civilisation as the two murderers of to-day.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Burdekin and Beer.
Mr. Burdekin, M.P. for East Sydney, objects to
the proposed taxation of land and income. His
objections are based upon “principle.” By a
strange coincidence his views accord admirably
with his evident interest. These coincidences
usually occur when wealthy men are brought to
consider taxation which touches their own
pockets. Men of moderate means usually submit
quietly to any taxation imposed upon them; it is
not so with the rich. Their principles invariably
lead them to make a stubborn resistance when
taxation is not levied upon those who can least
afford it. But Mr. Burdekin is not with-
out expedient. He would make up the re-
quired amount from three sources: (1) by an
increased sale of the State capital in Crown
lands; (3) by reduction of 2}4 per cent on the
Public Service Estimates; and (3) by an excise on
colonial beer. The first is a spendthrift’s alterna-
tive, the second is a legal robbery, if we are right
in considering it as an all-round reduction from
the pay of Civil servants, and the third is a mean
device for making the working classes contribute
from their small incomes that the Burdekos
of the country may escape. From Mr, Burde-
kin’s anxiety to draw from this last source
in order that incomes over £3OO, and land worth
more than £lOO3 may be free of taxation, we
should think he bad been reading English his-
tory; for there he will find that up to the middle
of the 17th century, all but an insignificant
fraction of the national revenues were drawn
from the landholders direct ; all State ex-
penditure was provided for from this source
and;no national debt incurred. But the nobles
in the reign of the profligate Charles 11. induced
the king to part with his land revenues for £300,000
a year, which sum was wrung by the dominant
party from the poorer classes in the form of cus-
toms and excise. The landholders by constitu-
tional trickery shifted the just burdens from the
land, and ever since that date the aggregation of
estates has gone on throughout England: and the
same system prevails here, because the poor are
made to carry the load that belongs to the rich. If,
as is jusr, the lands of the colony were made to
contribute fairly to State purposes, the Coopers
and Burdekins and others who monopolise im-
mense portions of the land-wealth of Sydney,
would find their power of accumulating wealth by
adding acre 10 a era and house to house, dimi-
nished to an alarming degree. But a reduction of
3>£ per cent, from the screw of a Civil servant,
and a tax of 6d. per gallon on colonial beer would
not harm the land-millionaires. What matter if
adding to the burdens of the poor brings them
daily nearer to destitution: what matter if the
task which they are set is made so huge that
thousands sink to desperation and become mere
gutter-loafers, area-sneaks, and Domain-crawlers?
Is not our native aristocracy still left? Are there
not magnificent mansions at Potts Point ?
Do not millionaires daily become richer ?
These are the signs of prosperity our conser-
vative legislators delight to observe. Take Is.
3d, from the £3 10s. which Tom the navvy,
who supports his wife and six children, used to
receive; make Jorrocks, the labourer, pay a
penny a pint more for the colonial beer, the only
stimulant which he can afford, and one which is as
necessary to him as tea to the abstainer-do these
things, but touch not the yearly thousands which
men of the class of Mr. Sydney Burdekin draw
from their tenants; ask them not to pay a farthing
to the State for the land which they hold. They
are gentlemanly and aristocratic; the vulgar
navvy, the unmannered labourer, and the insig-
nificant Civil servant are the people who should
pay all these nasty low taxes. “ If,” says Mr.
Burdekin, “ we must have taxation, it should be
gathered in other forms net so obnoxious as those
proposed by the Government.” Obnoxious! To
whom ? That is the point which this statesman
will have to explain to the electors of East
Sydney.

I lie Troubles of School Teachers.
In no branch of the New South Wales Civil ser-
vice are officers more harassed, worried, atd
bullied than in the Public Instruction Depart-
ment. The particular trouble just now is the cir-
cular calling upon all who are in charge of schools
or departments of higher grade than their own to
present themselves in June or December next for
examination; non-compliance with the mandate,
or failure to pass, entailing- degradation In the
service. That a school graded A 1 should have a
teacher of similar standing is certainly desirable,
but It Is very rough on teachers who have for a
long time held positions with credit to them-
selves and to the satisfaction of the inspectors
to be forced to cram again up to examina-
tion standard. The rule is an excellent
one, but it should have had a prospective
effect only; to make it retrospective is plainly
unjust. How is it possible for, say, the mistress
of a department, to devote the time necessary for
the cramming? She has to be in the class-room
during school hours: then the pupil teachers
(male and female I) have to be taught, (a work for
which no remuneration by extra salary or other-
wise is paid,) lessons arranged for the children,
next day, and at last, after odd matters incident to.
the conduct of the school or department have-
been attended to, the teacher may, if she have no
domestic labours to occupy further time, settle,
down to study for her own examinations. But
as all students know, it is impossible to do good,
work when the mind is fagged out. To keep on
working a weary brain is to discount at a ruinous-
rate the power needed for the work of the follow-
ing day. Besides this, few mistresses who have-
been for a long time In the service are without
large domestic duties, nor is it the desire of the
department that they should be. To such a one it
is an impossibility to undergo iherequired amount
of cramming. Degradation in the service will be
her only alternative—a poor reward for one who
has faithfully served the department for 10,15, or
20 years, and is able satisfactorily to per-
form the duties of her present condition.
Another grievance which peculiarly ffflicts
this class of officers is the 4 per cent, tax on
their incomes for the benefit of the Superannua,
tion Fund. The fund is to them a lottery in which
they have only the remotest possible chance of
winning anything. If they should remain in the
service until 60 years of age, they will receive a
pension, but what female teacher hopes or wishes
to continue teaching until that age ? Girls take to
teaching that they may not be dependent on those
who would otherwise be obliged to support them,
but when they marry and the census subsequently
benefits to a gratifying extent, their domestic
duties encroach more and more upon theirtime,
until it is necessary to resign the duties of office
for the claims of the household. If this 4 per cent,
were paid to an insurance company an annuity
equal to the superannuation would be obtainable
at 60, while in the event of earlier death the
capital sum insured for would be available with
profits for the benefit of any children. But under
the Government system the teacher may toll on
to 59 years of age, and then by death or retirement
lose all claim upon the fund. This, in the case of

Holy Abraham!
Again js the sacred name of Abraham the black
beast of the M’Quade family, of Sydney. In last
Saturday’s issue of the Sydney Daily Telegraph
we read the following interesting Judaic item of
information :
,injunction motion was applied for id
the Equity Court yesterday on behalf of
Frederick M’Quade to restrain one Abraham
Friedman from dealing with certain promissory
notes, given by F. M’Quade and his brother,
Hbkby. The former entered an affidavit showing
that in 1883, before he was of age, he borrowed
from Friedman £llOO, for which, with his brother
Henry, joint promissory notes to the sum of £3300
were given. The notes were dishonoured and a
compromise made to pay £2300, which was done.
Subsequently a further sum of £6OO was borrowed,
and a promissory note therelore entered into for
£2200, this amount including the £llOO which had
been previously struck out. This promissory note
was also dishonoured. A sum of £4OO was further
obtained, and a promissory note given for £lOOO.
The injunction was granted to the hearing of a
suit being brought by M,’Quad;e against Fried-
man, or until a further order of the Court was
made.
In the same issue of the D.T. appears the sub-
joined paragraph:—
“ The chaplain of the United States Congress, in
opening the session on March 36, offered up a
prayer which has oused considerable sensation.
It opened as follows :-Give ear, O God of Jacob,
and enable us to see the danger which threatens
the civilized world, a revolution more tremendous
than any which history tells, in which a reign of
terror may be created in every capital in Europe
and America. The prayer went on to say that the
time had come for selfish grinding monopoly to
cease, and that rich men should learn that their
great fortunes are not given to be spent in their
own pleasures.”
One of these days we shall have to adopt this
prayer In Sydney. Only when it comes into use
here it will begin—“ Give ear, O God of Abra-
hamsh 1 ”

The Gospel of Damnation.
Dr. Jefferis, the Congregational great gun of
New South Wales, whose weekly (spell it as you
please) maunderings fill a column in each of the
morning papers in Monday’s issue, prides himself,
we believe, upon the liberality of his sentiment
and the thoroughness of his logic. He professed
to have lugged his religion along with the ad»
vanning tread of modern thought, and to produce
a sample of theology meet for the requirement!
of the day. (He spurns the bigotry and intolerance
of a former age. Consequently he preaches ser»
mons on current topics, and gets column reports
in the morning papers. It was in accord with the
spirit of tolerance that he denounce! on last Sun-
day the dicta of Roman Catholic prelates, who
were wont to enjoin celibacy on those who would
be pure. He scouted such dogmas with the
energy which always characterises sectarian act-
ings—
*' It was assumed,” he said, “ with an arrogance
that would be irritating if it were not that
familiarity breeds composure, that the decisions
of certain prelates of the Italian race,and of the
bygone centuries, were to prescribe and define for
men of the Brltlsu race and of to-day what would
be the character and limitation of their marriage
laws.”
And having thus disposed of the pretentious
assumptions of the Italian prelates, he proceeded
to show what he himself could do in the same line.
For “ with an arrogance that would be irritating’
if it were not that the microscopic mental little-
ness of the speaker “ breeds composure,” he an'
nounced his “decision” as being that which
should “ prescribe and define for men of the
British race and of to-day, the character and
limitation of their marriage laws,” that—
“ Divorce was desecration. He did not suppose
that any could be so luminous ai to look forwaru

ance, if he believes that the m ajority of men of to

to you this may be piety, but to us it seems the
rankest of blasphemy to drag in the “ flery indig-
nation” ofa just ani merciful God to back up the
narrow, miserable, bigoted twaddle which it
pleases you to spout. Tell us, Dr. Jeffebis, who
authorised you to curse the people ? Who handec
to you this “judgment of flery indignation,” that
you might use it to terrify and coerce those whom
you could not persuade or lead ? You, oh mighty
Congregational is t! are right in saying that no at-
tention should be paid to the blasphemous maun-
derings of Italian prelates; but tell us, we ask,
where is the difference in point of value between
your fulmlnations and theirs? Jebome was but
the antetype of Jeffebis. Or rather, Jeffebis is
but a bacterian Jerome.

A Clean Bowl-out for the “ gyduay Daily
Telegraph.”
In the middle of February last, when the Sydney
Daily Telegraph was still inflated to bursting-
point with Soudan glory, a volume called the
“Australian Portrait Gallery ” was published. As
this production surrounded things with a Soudan-
jflory halo, and even possibly for other reasons
the D. T. gave it a splendid notice. But nearly
three months afterwards, when the glamour of
cornstalk militarism had become tarnished, it was
found out that tha Government had bought 500
copies of this “Portrait Gallery,” wheieupon the
D.T. waxed rageous. The two notices are a glori-
ous contrast. They are as follows: -
This (the italics are And this on the 13th

“ This is a noble remit
of painstaking research
and picturesque ability—
at once a valuable addi-
tion to the historical re-
cords of the colony and a
handsome gilt-edged vo-
lume for the drawing-
room table. The lives
of 34 of the prominent
figures of two genera-
tions of colonists are set
before the reader, and
each biography is sup-
plemented by a litho-
graphic portrait from
the pencil of Mr. W.
Maoleod. There is also
as an appendix, a con-
densed history of the
Soudan expedition, and
to complete the work, a
copy of the Constitution
Act. The biographies
are written from a
standard above that of
party politics. They
record alike good and
bad qualities of politi-
cians of every phase of
thought; and without

On the motion for ad-
journment, two other
matters of some con-
siderable importance
cropped up. Mr. Wil-
liam Clarke complained
that Government money
had been spent in pur-
chasing’ a publication
called “The Australian
Portrait Gallery.” The
book in question was an
illustrated series of poli-
tical biographies, and ig,
to say the very least, a
most singular publica-
tion for a Mleiatry to
identify Itself with. By
a very suspicious coinci-
dence the resources of
both pen and j. encil have
been exhausted in pre-
senting the portraits of
the men then in power
in the most flattering
colours. Other public
men have been written
down with just as much
enthusiasm as the party
in office have been written
up. To purchase such a
book as this with public
money, and without the
sanction of Parliament,
Wes an act of which it is
difficult to say whether
vanity or audacity is the
more striking feature.
It is one of the national
undertakings of the
Stuart Government, and
has helped to swell the
deficit which has been
bequeathed by that
Ministry to the colony.
Why, therefore, it was
a'ked last night, should
tne present Government
be held responsible ? No
reason why, except that
the present Government
is asking for the money
to pay for this piece of
criminal extravagance.
In this Government Mr.
Dibbs is Colonial Secre-
tary, and in the Stuart
Government he was
Colonial Treasurer.
Prom the Treasurer’s
advance account that
money came, and to re-
imburse the Treasury
for its advance its equi-
valent is now demanded.
Mr. Dibbs should be in-
terrogated about it. His
colleagues should ask
him to make good this
money. He ha 1 charge
of it when it was spent.
The country gave him
no authority to advance
money for the purchase
of fulsome eulogies of the
Stuart party or stupid
libels on their opponents.
It is against the
country's interest t o
have these things circu-
lated.”

Michael Davitt and Oxford.
a eS TT in Bt ° re for the BeDBi tive
Will hat« f ° ford University. Some months
ave to Pass before they will get over the
shock of having unwittingly slept one night under
the same college roof as Michael Davitt. A
letter in the Oxford Review, forwarded to us a
few days ago, puts the case pathetically. Th
Davitt is, it is complained, “ an ex-convict, and
person of openly-expressed disloyalty.” Wei
after all, the world now knows that Davitt is anc
always was an honest man. He graduated in
larger university than Oxford. The man with
big heart who climbs step after step up the stai
of poverty, knows, when he comes to a breathin
place upon a landing, much more of the truths o
life than shaven pedants could ever teach him
Davitt did not sell his knowledge for money. I
war the sort of knowledge that makes the weak
and downtrodden look up and fancy they beholc
the dawn of a day of redemption reddening in th
east. He gave th’s knowledge away. He
gave himself, away too. He and his hearer
tried to hurry up the dawn. That wa
what made him a convict. But he came
out without name or fame stained. No
leading man in literature thought his hand too
good to give to Davitt. A seat in the English
House of Commons was provided for him. It is
true that in a partisan sense of the term he is stll
disloyal. He insists upon having Ireland ruled by
an Irish Parliament. But in that sense Gladstone
also is disloyal. So are almost all Irishmen, anc
the greater part of Englishmen. So are very
many of the best students in Oxford itself. The
horizon is therefore gloomy to the sensitive par-
ties to whom loyalty, as they understand the
term, is the first of duties. But Oxford has a
habit of getting up gloomy horizons at great
periods. It was there Ring Edmund was mur-
dered. When William the Conqueror marched
up thejgates of Oxford were slapped in his face.
It was in Oxford that Cranmer, Ridley, and
Latimer were put to death for being good Pro-
testants. The students of Oxford took up arms
against Henry 111. They made Cromwell, the
arch-revolutionist of his day, the rebel and regi-
cide, thiir Chancellor. The loyalists of Oxford
should fortify themselves by 1 hlnking over these
things. In such a home of political consistency
Michael Davitt may not alone sleep there again
but enter the gates and take his seat as Chancellor
at the head of the long hall.
Whfn a split comes in a theological camp, the
onlooking world has fun. Divines, as a rule, never
admit that anything they formerly said was wrong.
On the contrary, had they but one breath they
would spend it asseverating that never in their
whole individual or corporate existence had they
a single time missed the bull’s eye of abstract and
everlasting truth. Hence, when common sense
gets too much for some old cob-webbed dogma,
the divine’s retreat from the ancient orthodox
position would be ludicrously pitiable did he not
preserve such an opera-bouffe majesty of car-
riage. This makes it simply laughable. Nothing
in the Christian system has been more authori-
tatively established than that the prayers of the
faithful could draw rain from the skies. O ver and
over again, year after year, and century after cen-
tury, this belief was acted upon, and a question
never rose within any fold of the Christian church
as to the revealed soundness of the practice. Out-
side, in the halls of science, doubt, however, began.
It waxed strong. It inoculated the clerical mind.
Divines set out in retreat. But did these re-
treating divines admit that they were run-
ning away from an discredited dogma? Not
at all. Bishop Mooshouse suspended the prayer
because, as he alleged, the people of Victoria
would not dig dams enough. Dean Macartney
stopped it because the Government were not
sending a sufficient number of diamond-drills
around the country. Others, who wanted to keep
on similar friendly terms with the exponents of
science, ran from the cob webbed old dogma with
excuses of a like kind. But so far in Australia no
retreat has been effected under a cover so ingeni-
ous in one sense, end, from the standpoint of a
bishop in the grand old faith before which half the
race has bent the knee, so utterly opera bouffish as
that of Dr. Stanton, Bishop of Northern Queens-
land. A couple of weeks ago, when cattle
were dying in the West and people were languish-
ing for water, some members of his fold appealed
to him to order the church prayer for rain to be
offered up, and holding science by his right hand
and his threadbare old creed by the other, this
episcopal refugee to the asylum of common sense
replied that ‘from the geographical condition of the
country sufficient rain-fall was an impossibility! ’
Why do these clerics not cut the prayer honestly
out of the Prayer Book, say it was put in there
when the populacs believed a mitred man was
hand-in-glove with the Almighty, and that most
who now stand as teachers between the Seen and
Unseen are unprepar2d to perpetuate hollow and
farcical imposition ? If not, why not keep on
praying as they used to do and curie science and
the sons of science in the rotund terms of old ?

It must be a gorgeous thing to be an Agent-
General. If you are one you have chances of
dining with dukes, making merry with marquises,
and hobnobbing with royal highnesses. Mr.
Murray-Smith, the late Agent-General for Vic-
toria, has enjoyed these precious advantages to
the utmost. At the valedictory banquet given
him in London lately, a royal duke presided, and
another duke and several earls lent the lustre of
patrician presence to the proceedings. The riff-
raff of knights and oipolloi of C.M.G.’s who were
also there are not to be mentioned in the same
breath, though any one of them would be con-
sidered a personage at Potts Point. Granville
(of course) made a speech in which he suggested
that Australia should have its own military college
and “supply recruits to the scientific branches of
the army.” It is very clear that Plain Bill
has let us in for it. We are expected to
be always ready and eager to turn our plough-
shares into lieldpleces and rush to help Old Eng"
land in her hour of need. And, for these enthu-
siastic toadies, she will always be having hours of
need. If it amused them and did not hurt us we
should not care. But It does hurt us —to the ex-
tent that we are made ridiculous in the eyes of
Europe and the sensible portion of England. Our
German, French, and Italian fellow-colonists are
iraong the best citizens we have. How will they
ike to have to contribute their shares of taxes for
jho support of a contingent intended, perhaps, to
flght against their own countrymen ? And what
other emigrants from Germany, France, or Italy
we * xpe ?\ to come °ut to a country where
eir national identity is ignored whenever Old
England happens to get into a mess and has an
hour of need? What do they care for Old England
and her hours of need ? Not a farthing. They
esire to make homes for themselves, rear their
families in comfort and live at peace with all men
except, perhaps, absentee land-monopolists and
burglars. If they cannot do this in Australia they
will go elsewhere. By the way, although most of
the speeches made at the banquet turned upon the
subject of Australian loyalty, and several refer-
ences were made to the Contingent and its glori-
ous deeds, not a word was said about the Master
Spirit who organised and sent it forth upon its
noble mission of capricide. The name of Dalley
was never mentioned. How soon the memory of
great men passes away I How soon the coM world
forgets I But yesterday and the name of Dalley
made the Czar tremble in hid Imperial halls, and
Bismarck shudder in his shoes. Now-even if it
were bellowed through a coach-horn—it would
not frighten a goat. This is a cold, cold world I

The poets have often sung about the bells. They
have hung around them tender associations, they
have invested their brazen clamour with a glamour
to us inexplicable. Prout and Poe, and those
other sweet singers who chanted the praises of
campanology, never could have lived in the
vicinity of a Sydney church, or they would-curs-
ing Instead of blessing—have poured out the vials
of their wrath on the heads of the bellringers and
every other church functionary up to the arch-
bishop. The ordinary “ ding, dong, dell, come to
church, or go to—bed,” is quite bad enough; but
when they proceed to dole out the “ Old Hundred,’,
or some other lively ditty with a lorg pause be-
tween each note, reminding you of the one-flnger
tunes your big sister used to soothe you with in
your teething days, then it is that your troubles
come home to you. You are reading, or writing, or
trying to sleep, when these jarring reverberations
fall upon your brain, with a measured exactness
suggestive of the torture of the Chinese water-
tower-where, a drop of water falling from agr;at
height, at regular intervale, on the head of the
condemned, produces, first madness, then exhaus-
tion, and finally death. We are somewhat far
advanced in the first, and weekly approaching the
second stage. We long for the day when bell-
ringers shall be hanged and boiled down, their feet
made into glue, and their skins tanned under the
provisions of the New South Wales Dog Act.

Cardinal Moran's utterances on any topic what-
ever, would not receive any further attention, for
they merit none, than would those of any other
man seized in his opening manhood, crammed
with the special but useless learning of a by-
gone age, and overwhelmed with the impressive
ceremonial which antiquity has bequeathed, were
it not for his Kyardinal's hat. Had he remained
plain Father Moran and burled himself in the
work of an ordinary country priest he might have
gone on with his mole-Ilke researches in Irish anti-
quities until possibly he had electrified the Vatican
by producing a good paying relic such as the
thigh-bone of St. Patrick, He would have got the
Pope's blessing, some small promotion, and the
world would not be troubled with his deliverances
on the matters of science of which he has had
little time to become acquainted in the upward
scramble for a red cap. And now wisdom is sup-
posed to follow that p!ece of red rag. His last de-
liverance is widely printed wherein he says that
with almost the sole exception of SirISAAO Newton
all the great discoveries have been made by
Catholics, or men who bad been taught by Catho-
lics. Now,' any fool knows that till within the last
300 years or so everybody with any learning was
nominally Catholic, and the Cardinal might just as
well say that all the great discoveries were made
by men with two legs, for all his argument proves
as to the nursing of science by the church. And
his allusion to Sir Isaac may excuse us for re-
minding his adoring flock that it was mainly
through Voltaire and Madame du Chatelet’s
translations and expositions that Newton s dis-
coveries were brought before the benighted people
of the Continent. Voltaire was certainly brought
up a Catholic, and he taught Catholics. One of the
most significant lessons he taught was to treat
with derision the pretentions of mole-eyed and
ambitious prelates, whose strength lies, not in the
free support ©f intelligent hearers, but in dumb,
submissive ignorance.

It has become the fashion now in certain quarters
lin England and Australia to make comparisons be-
tween Valentine Baker and Charles Dilke in
their capacity of morally broken-down gentlemen.
It is pointed out that the associate of the Prince of
Wales behaved “with fine instincts” when th
case came into court, whereas tbe man of th
people acted in what appeared to be the spirit of
pettifogging attorney. There is, we admit, para
doxical as it may appear, gentle manliness in crime
and there was a ray of chivalry in Baker's be
haviour during the time Miss Dickenson’s evi
dence was under consideration. Until, however, the
whole of the Craweord case comes out (as it will i
the Queen’s Proctor do his duty) it is premature tc
try to determine which of the fallen men is the
more gentlemanly. This we will presently men
tlon—just to keep the popular scales even—
Valentine Baker's attempted assault on Miss
Dickenson was not an isolated turpitude. The
Prince’s associate wore a bad character in most of
I the garrison-towns he lived in. In Colombo he was
horsewhipped by a merchant named Wilson, and
he spent some time looked up in Wellicaddy Gaol
for being, on two occasions, unduly amorous. If
we are to compare the associate of royalty and
the associate of the people, let us do it right along
the line of published facts.
Albury, sitting asleep among her vlne-trtsaed
hills, with her white feet in the clear broad river!
will one day awake and stand erect and be a great
olty. From her situation alone, in the centre of a
fine agricultural district—the wines of which are,
Bven now, in infancy, held up to the light
and looked upon benignly by purple-beaked
jpicures in remote corners of the world—and the
norement of population, this would slowly but

to pass the bridge unscathed and euchre the despot
on their own side. We have frequently seen the
debased and furtive Victorian at his unpatriotic
manoeuvres. Wehave seen him, attired in the
ruins of a cabbage-tree hat, supported under his
Aiw5 a w d^ bb ° n ° r a Jeathern Strap, ride into
Albury. we have noted that he sat proudly in his
saddle, and, with an ostentatious disregard of the
weather, generally wore no ether clothing than a
shirt and a pair of trouseis. We have seen him
many hours afterwards return, disguised in a hard
hat and exalted with alien rum, wearing three
complete suits of skp?, and trying to keep a good
grip on the pommel and look innocent at the
same time. Under the flag of Federated Aus-
tralia these things will not be, and the people
over the river will gradually grow virtuous
again. The awaking may come at any moment.
To-day there is excitement in the town, and
clamour of bush voices in tho hotel bars. Grave
city fathers come upon you suddenly and lead yoii
into bye-ways, and produce blocks of low-class
road-metal, and ask you what you think of that
for a specimen, and tell you there’s lots more
where that came from, and swear you to secresy
about it, and carry on more like Bendigo men
than white people. There is good gold being got
in the reefs close to the town at last, and every in-
dication of more to come. For years and years
people have rooted for gold cut kmong the grim
hills overlooking the river, but in,a desultory
and half-hearted way. Gold has always been
found in quantities almost payable, but there
is no mistake about It now. There is renewed
prosperity in the mining interest in the Bordeir
City. From Hawkesbury, Splitters' Creek, and the
Black Range the news is good. Who knows how
soon “ Nailcan” shares mfly be bargained for under
The Verandah ? Over all Australia a great mining
revival is taking place. It seems thrit as our
agricultural and pastoral prosperity fails, our
mining prosperity increases. This is probably
one of the worst years for farmers and squatters
that New South Wales has ever seen, and it will
probably be famed for some of the finest gold ano
silver discoveries yet made. The revelations of
the diamond-drill may make Stawell a new
Ballarat—the splendid prospects of Lansell’s deep
shaft have made Sandhurst like an intoxicated
ant-hill; Maldon is rolling in gold;.from Chiltern,
Ballarat, Port Darwin, and Gympie the returns are
good; the silver mine at Captain’s Flat,near Quean,
beyan, is.a perfect Bonanza, as is also said to be that
about to be floated at Coen, in Queensland. And
in Grafton they won’t listen to anything less than
lOOoz, of gold to the ton 1 Rimberley,may yet fur-
nish a goldfield that will support half the mining
population of the world; but, aiasl how many
hundreds-perhaps thousands-of poor devils will
lie coflinless in those hot wastes—“wherethesouth
wind seldom wanders and the winters will not
stay ” before them ? The present rush is without
reasen and is simply insane. With the memories
of Port Curtis and Port Darwin in their minds men
ought to stay where they can get Christian Jmrlal.
Our own country has good enough inducements
for those who seek to dig for gold or mine fqr
silver, Heaven knows.
We read that “each N.B.W. blackfellow
now costs Government at least £6 a year, exclu-
sive of the cost of his annual blanket.” If ex-
penses go up this way and people set paid for
having been born aborigines, we shall have
Parkes’ disappointed followers getting a blanket

M. Papamiohalopoulos has been appointed
Premier of Greece. It is believed that this ap-
pointment will ensure peace. It a man with a
name like that can’t do it then is there no virtue

A Melbourne Argos scribe, “doing” an
infant asylum, made a most affecting discovery.
Bhe found that when a “mother arrives to see her
little one she rushes to the gate to welcome her
with as much eager affection as any lawfully-
begotten child could exhibit.” Oh, remarkable
phenomenon! That the child of a woman whose
misfortune it is to have loved too well should te
born with the same affectionate Instincts as the
offspring of “respectable” ladies who have sold
themsalvea to men they loathe for the sake of a
position or a title! We know*a good many “law-
fully-begotten” families In which any sign of

The oldest foreign

130. He was a Manilla

landed in Fiji, with two
companions, about the
year 1801. He stood by
Cakebau through the
many wars that lent a
lustre to the reign of that
spirited monarch. And
now he is dead. It is said
that he lied with his usual
ease and cheerfulness to
the last. The statement
of his age was given with

During the hearing
of the celebrated “ Bryce
v. Rusden ” case the sub-
ject of Maori cannibalism
was alluded to by the
lawyers. Baron Huddles-
ton asked Sir John Gorst,
who defended Rusden,
whether he had ever
heard about a Mr. Thomp-
son, who in 1842 was sent
to N.Z. as a police magis-
trate, and who, if report
spoke truly, met with an
untimely fate. Sir John
replied in the negative,
and Baron Huddleston
explained that it was re-
ported at the time that
Mr. Thompson, who had
gone into a Maori district
to adjudicate on a Native
lawsuit, was, after the
trial was over, killed and
eaten by the parties to
the suit. He was very
thin. So is this story.
Mr. Charles Gillespie,
proprietor of the'.Kairori
Hotel, Wellington (N.Z),
had a narrow escape from
being massacred by the
Maories (when a lad of 15)
about 30 years ago. At
that time his father, his
elder brother, and him-
self, were working on a
farm in the Hutt district,
which was garrisoned by
soldiers, the natives being
then in a state of chronic
“rebellion” against the
Government. One day
Charles left his father
and brother in the hut,
preparing dinner, and
went a message for one
of the soldiers on duty in
the neighbourhood. He
was gone only a few
minutes. On his return,
he entered the dwelling,
and instead of finding his
dinner ready as he ex-
pected he was horrified to
see his father and brother
lying on the floor, welter-
ing in their blood, the
father quite dead, and the
brother able only to say
that the Maories had
tomahawked them, and
that he hoped he would
be kind to their mother,
who was then living in
Wellington, before he
also expired.

We are much afflicted to hear from a
London source that Henniker Heaton objects to
Tun Bulletin. He recently wrote to the Colonial
Institute expressing strong disapproval of the
paper, which he of course described as “scurrilous”
(the usual word, you know) and protested against
the presence of the file in the Institute. The
committee of course took no notice of Mr. Heaton’s
objections, but it is singular that the members
lately have failed te find the usual Bulletin in
its place.
Speaking of Sir Saul Samuel’s protest
against Henniker’s pretensions to set up as the
Grand Mogul of Australia, the Jbrnil’S London
correspondent says:—“ Sir Saul hates Henniker in
a truly Hebraic fashion. Poor pigmy! Heaton i*
too hifrh up the ladder to be affected by anything
he can do.” "In a truly Hebraic fashion!”
Humph 1 It would take a lot to make Sydney
people believe that Sir Samuel condescends to
hate Mr. Henniker Heaton on account of the lat-
ter’s Christianity.
Judge Noel, of Melbourne, the ablest
Judge who ever presided over the Victorian In-
solvency Court, is so ill that the Government have
appointed Judge Worthington to temporarily tike
h;s place. When Judge Noel was away on leav e
of absence, two years ago, the Adonislan Judge
Quinlan was appointed to act as his locum tenens,
but owing, it is said, to the fact that many of the
decisions of that functionary were reversed on
appeal to the Supreme Court, it was not thought
advisable ,to place him over the Bankruptcy
Court again.

year, while hundreds of hungry people around
him crawled shivering through a famished and
hopeless existence. And such men as the vicar of
St. Mart-in-ln-the-Eields exclaim on Sundays from
the pulpit: Dearly beloved brethren, “ lay not up
for yourselves treasures on earth.” Of such is the

The death early last month of Dr. Trench,
Archbishop of Dublin, recalls a good old-crusted
weil-known story “ originally ” told of the pre-
late, who was a hypochondriac, and was con-
stantly experiencing what he took to be premoni-
tlens of paralysis. The last course had been
served at a grand banquet, when the Archbishop
agitatedly said to hia daughter: “I fear that I am
threatened with one of my bad attacks; I have
been pinching my knee for the last five minutes,
and I eannot feel the slightest sensation.” “Make
your mind easy, your Grace,” rejoined a lady on
the other side of the table, “it was my knee you
have been pinching.”
The Queen—down, little fluttering heart!
—appears to have hit up an an ingenious device
for obtaining necessary rest (I) during drawing-
room receptions, A London high Tory paper says:
—“ It used to be the upright position that fatigued
her so much and caused her to retire early. This
evil has now been remedied By a means by which
her Majesty can rest during the function, and
from which she has found considerable relief.”
We would give worlds to be let into the secret
that lurks in this mysterious paragraph. Can it be
that an arm-chair or a sofa is concealed some-
where in the royal “ improver ? ”
The Duke of Connaught, a son of Queen
Victoria, has been appointed a staff Major-General
to command a division of the Bengal army. This
promotion over the heads of older officers was
justly earned for distinguished services rendered
at the taking of Carthage, and for his valour sub-
sequently in beating back step by step the forces
of Marshal Soult in the Peninsular War. The
Duke’s exploits at the battle of the Boyne, and his
godlike valour in heading the Balaclava charge
are too recent to need comment. He is a brother
of the Duke of Edinburgh, who was ones in Aus-
tralia, and under whose command Nelson won
what little distinction he ever gained.
We read in the Sydney D.T. that “ whilst
at Grafton, Lord Carlngton was introduced to an
old salt named Richard Paine, 80 years of age, who
fought under Nelson.” This affords yet another
convincing proof of the marvellous energy of the
British in times of war. As Mr. Dick Paine could
have barely reached his fifth year at the time
Nelson died at Trafalgar—lBos-it is no marvel that
England swept all before her when “ sucking ”
Admirals Joined her navy at such a tender age.
Perhaps Mr. Richard will favour us with his
memoirs of the battle, and his comments thereon
The prominence given to old Dick’s statement
almost suggests the irreverent idea that editors of
daily papers need a course of elementary lessons in
history,
On the occasion of Judge Paul’s first visit
to Roma (Q) he was met and escorted into town
by a large number of the residents, some of whom,
with loyalty to long-established customs in such
cases, had pushed conviviality to the extreme
border of sobriety. One of their number cheer-
f“fly remarked to the judge :“I suppose we may
state that the notification of your visit was the
First Epistle of Paul to the Roma-ns?” 11 Well ”
replied the Judge, “ had it come now, it would be
more properly called the First Epistle of Paul to
the Tlght-uns,” Which is one of the best speci-
mens extant of that most dismal of all
commodities, Australian forensic wit. It is 10
years since we heard a respectable joke made in
court, save by a contumacious witness; and we
don t remember ever having known a Supreme
Court judge—barring the late Mr. Justice Fallows,
of Victoria—give expression to a notable plea-
santry.
Nine years ago a
fair-haired little boy
of about five summers
was brought by his father
to one of the leading
musicians In the Cabbage
Garden, and this gentle-
man was Informed by the
hopeful parent that he
thought there was
something in his boy.”
Further explanations led
to the youngster being
treated to a trial gallop
a piano, and so well
did he shape that a public
exhibition of his remark-
able powers was arranged
ior. At to is exhibition
he played some half-
dozen pieces ; notably,
the “II Alio Tesoro,”
from Don Giovanni, with,
such exquisite taste and
marveUous correctness
that he was at once styled
the "Australian Mozart.”
Another innate ana sur-
prising faculty he dis-
played, when, standing
several yards from the
piano, and with his back
turned towards it, he cor-
rectly, and Instantly
called out the names of
the notes In chords struck
by Mr. J. Summers and
Mr. Pulver. These gentle-
men tested him in every
form of progression, in-
version, &o„ and in all
keys without finding a
single mistake in his
answers. As a finale, the
little fellow played a
lively strain of his own
composition In the key of
C.and by a progression
of flats conducted it
through a complete circle
of modulation back to
the key from which he
started. After this he
studied under the best
masters in Melbourne,
«od in December last our
little wonder, Master
Ernest Hutchinson, was
sent to England at public
expense to compete for

From a letter written by
him to Dr. Torrance wo
learn that he failed to se-
cure the first prize, but
under circumstances
which fully justified the
good opinion formed by
his friends, and which
should entitle him to at
least as hearty a welcome
on his return as we award
to a crack cricketer, or
oarsman. Three hundred
candidates competed for
the prize, and these were
reduced by examination
to six, the little Austra-
lian being one of them,
but he fell out in the
next round. Personally,
we do not hold a very
exalted opinion of these
examinations. The Duke
of Edinburgh, for ex-
ample, was passed with
flying colours as an
R A.ftf., and yet he can’t
play well enough to se-
cure an engagement in a
dog-and-monkey circus.
That all was not strictly
O.K. at the last exam,
seems possible, from the
fact that little Hutchin-
son complains that al-
though he was called
upon to play, modulate,
transpose, read at sight,
and tell by ear chorda
struck, still he was aofe
asked a single question in
that most Important
branch of all-harmony,
notwithstanding that
papers sent to Austra-
lia expressly said that
the work would in-
clude a harmony paper.
We sincerely trust little
Ernest will reach the top-
most rung of his profes-
sion, but at the satr e
time we are quite sure
it would b© i»r more

lowering unfinished hencoops on the Association
Ground, or pulling a cedar plank on the Parra-
matta river.
An old and a new-world story of the ex-
periences of religious deputations, Lord Thurlow
once sa;d to a deputation of Dissenters: “ Gentle-
men, I am for the established religion, and If you
can only get your d— religion established, I will
support that, too.” It is related of a certain
N.B. W. knight that he had one morning in the dim
Sometimeago received three deputations, and
thought there were no more to come, but in this
he erred, for a small, thin, meek, and exceedingly
pious little parson marched in at the head of
several more who looked like his younger breth-
ren. The statesman looked at them and greeted
them with: ‘‘And what the Sheol do you
want It was religious teaching in State school a
that they wanted, but they scooted without
troubling to ask for it.
A London correspondent of the Sydney
Evening News writes to say that Captain Loftuo,
who was gazetted Secretary to the Colonial Bxhl-
bitlon Commission at a salary and allowances of
*BO a month, because he was the son of our late
lamented Augustus, “ cannot be found at his office
or at the Exhibition, but that his name figures
with strictest punctuality on the monthly pay,
sheet.” Which Is probably a wicked libel, as the
truth is not always in the Evening News. But, even
were the allegation founded on fact, why should
these vulgah Australian fellahs enqulaw about
such twines when evewybody knows a man’s

Mr. Edward Valentine Browne, who won
his action for libel against Melbourne Punch
some time ago, receiving £3OO and costs as a balm
for his wounded feelings, has just given a publica-
tion to the world which for sarcastic observations,
humour, and small capitals, takes the bronze
medal against all comers. The bulk of the brochure
is taken up with a series of very small comments,
In very large type, upon the conduct of all and
several who were in any way concerned with his
case. Mr. Carrington Is quoted as saying that Mr,
Browne once “dressed as a baby at a fancy-dress
bail, and that he afterwards “had his head
shaved.” If E. Y. B. will take our solemn advice
he will have his head shaved again, and will like-
wise put it under a pump, and also in a refrigera-
tor until his present mania for book-writing
evaporates. Andthehumour ? Oh, yes, certainly:
that is contained in two words on the title-page—
“price sixpence.” The book Is called “E. V.
Browne’s own Punch.” The name ruins its pros-
pects straight. Melbourne has hitherto just been
able to exist in spite of one Punch, but with two

Holy Adelaide is rich in “disclosures” just
now. Naughtiness appears to be quite epidemic
in the City of Saints. The latest debutante at the
police court is Mrs. Elizabeth Watson, who lately
played the role of Mrs. Crawford at another court,
with Mr. Kingston (ex Attorney-General) as the
local Sir Charles Dilke. In a word Mrs. Watson is
a divorced lady. But she is like the prodigal. She
wants to return home and be forgiven. It was
with this object in view that Mrs. Watson solicited
an mteiview with her husband the other day. She
pleaded—he remained obdurate. Poor Mrs. Watson
had come fully prepared for obduracy. After
putting the question “ will you take me back—
once I twice 1 thrice I” —she landed hubby heavily
across the head with some stones tied up in a
handkerchief. As he still refused to take her once
again to his bosom, she broke her umbrella over
his front teeth. Hence the aggrieved lady’s
appearance in the dock. By the way, she further
threatens to shoot the unrelenting Watson with a
six-chambered revolver. Mr. Kingston gave her
the weapon, so she states, and taught her to bring
down a blow-fly at 30 paces. Revolver-nractice
must be a favourite pastime with the Kingston
family. The brother of the ex Attorney-General
once shot a cabman, just to keep his eye in.
It is not altogether an unalloyed joy to be
called Smith. Lord Carington will discover this
one of these days, or we are mistaken. At any
rajte, if be does not, it will not be the fault of a
young man of that name who galvanised Grenfell
and paralysed Young lately by announcing him-
self as his (Lord Carington’s) nephew, and giving a
champagne supper to the chief men of those loyal
townships. He was a splendid success while he
lasted. People intrigued to get him to drink with
them, and went home haloed with glory when they
had got him to accept an invitation to dinner. The
handsome daughters of the district lavished their
bewitching smiles upon him as he passed, and
their young men wished him dead every time.
Then the end came with a crash. The gay and
charming Smith was dlacoverid to be a very
hollow and disgusting sham after all. He had
showered a snowstorm of cheques upon the town,
all of which were found to be valueless. And the
townspeople had given him their good money for
them, not to mention that they had made asses of
themselves in other ways. Smith, of course,
vanished at the first sign of failing credit. The
local paper facetiously observes that he went to
Sydney “probably to see his uncle.” His cheques
may now be bought by the pound at current rates
for waste paper. A large proportion of the in-
habitants of Grenfell and Young are now pro-
fessed Republicans and greet any reference to
rank with gloomy derision.
The Melbourne A«e recently published a
letter which was sent to Mr. Fronde by a Mr. He
Castella, a Victorian taxpayer, in re some juicy
little errors in " Oceana.” It seems that the great
author was a guest of Mr. De Castella’s when
these colonies staggered under his weight, and
whilst the wine was in, possibly—we only say
possibly—mine host warmed to the occasion, and
electrified his guest with interesting reminiscences
of Paris life in February, 1848, Mr. Froude snapped
up these iterrs, and when “Oceana” reached
Australia, M. De Castella was horrified to read how
his stories had been distorted; and fixed up as his
own personal experiences. Hear him wail:—"Ever
since I read your statements I have been haunted
by them. I have not been a detective-officer I I
have had nothing to do with the French police! I
did not fight in the streets in February’4Bl I did
not serve in Caussidiere s hordel” But worse, and
worse, “Oceana” thrilled the world with a state-
ment to the effect that, though, Madame Da Cas-
telia was moderately ricb, she might have been just
rolling in riches had she pleased her friends by
marrying someone else, This was condemned
prevarication, and enough to make most men rip
the book beyond recognition, and prance about
knocklng-out Imaginary Frondes in two rounds.
M. De Castella writes for redress; probably he’d
as soon take it with a hoe-handle as not. Colonial
celebrities will henceforth bar;their doors against
old world book writers who visit them in the guise
of valetudinarians.
It is still a disputed question whether the
Marquis of Normanby intends taking one more
plunge into the sea of matrimony. If the harm
ie®s gentleman has really centred his noble
affections upon a “colonial young lady” (who
shall be nameless, because we are not quite sure as
to which one it Is) we shall offer no opposition to
the match. The Marquis is no longer young, cer-
tainiy—but neither was Boucicault when he led
his golden-haired goddess to a Sydney altar. How-
ever, the Marquis has an advantage over Dion B.
inasmuch as he has burled his first wife. So, take
it altogether, we’re downright glad that the ex-
victorian Governor isn’t a Russian. Yes; that a
. we were wanting to arrive at. Under
me Czar’s benevolent despotism noblemen and
gentlemen of a “certain age” are sternly pro-
mDited from tasting nuptial joys. In the opinion

Bummerj. The poor old boy was torn away from

Normanby sent the Russian Major a hearty

Political
Points
Mirams of Victoria is preparing an exhaus-
tive reply to G. H. Reid’s recent freetrade
oration.
Mr. John Davies (in the N.S.W Assembly):
“the sooner we go to the country the better.”
What would we not do if Mr. John Davies would
but say “ some other country ’’—and act upon it!
In Portugal ballot-boxes for the reception
of votes are generally placed in churches between
the statues of two saints. Dan. O'Connor, although
a true son of the Church, generally looks out for
two good tough sinners to act as scrutineers.
One of the Anglican bishops in Ireland
writes:—” Home Rule would banish from Ireland
all that is good and intelligent In it”—meaning
no doubt that he and his handful of followers
would have to look out for better feeding grounds.
The Melbourne Age, which no failure in
its prophecies can daunt, asserts that “ unless the
Great Powers land an army in the Crimea as they
did in 1854, Russia, either singly or in league with
Franc , will seize the opportunity for invading
Turkish dominions once more.”
Touching the absurd N.S.W. Liquor Traffic
Commission, the only important point on which
the Government is divided now is whether it
would be better to use the members of the Com-
mission as a door-mat, or to put them on handles
and use them as offlce-mops. In either capacity
they would be of far greater use than they are at
present.
A DUDE’S DELIGHT.
HOSTESS: “I’M AFRAID YOU ARE NOT ENJOYING YOURSELF.”
MASHER: “I AM INDEED, THOUGH. MORE THAN A DOZEN GIRLS’ EYES ARE GLUED
ON ME.”
“ Mr. John Davies complains of the N.S.W.
Executive Commissioner to the Indo-Golonial Ex-
hibition, Sir A. Stuart, and his son, receiving £2OOO
a year.” We don’t, though we don’t think poor
Sir Alick needs any pecuniary Inducement to keep
him from accepting diamond rings from Spiers
and Pond, the caterers.
Henniker Heaton has a letter in the
Morning Post defending bis universal penny
postage scheme, for which 140 members of the
House of Commons voted, and to promote which
the wily Henniker is starting a league. “The
Postmaster-General,” remarks H.H., “calculated
the loss attendant on the carrying-out of my
Scheme at £360,000 a year. During Kowland Hill’s
agitation the authorties calculated the loss at
£1,500,000 a year. The profit on the British Post-
Office to day is just £3.000,000 a year.”
The Western GRAziEßvery sec sibly points
out that the united request of the colonies for free
admission of Australian wool to the (J. 8., will be
followed by a similar one from the mammoth
pastoralists of South America. Already the gra-
ziers of the great Platte Valley are our greatest
rivals, and they have the advantage of distance to
bring their produce to the Eastern manufacturing
States. The Grazier thinks the concession asked
for by us if extended to South America will have
the effect of handicapping us more heavily than
now.
“ There is a sign of a revival of Nihilism in
Russia, and, by way of precaution, a decree has
been issued preventing the use of wreaths at
funerals It is said that these wreaths teach the
doctrines of the revolution.” Besides, it’s just as
well to get the nobility of Russia broken la to
being buried without wreaths. There may be a
vague profundity and general vastnegs about the
remains now and then that will make the decora-
ting with wreaths a bit puzzling and rather
widespread. Wreaths of smoke, though, may be
supplied at this class of funeral. These wreaths
also “ teach the doctrines of the revolution.”
A society of saints in Adelaide, called the
Vigilance Association, held a meeting lately to
consider “ how to free Parliament from scandalous
offenders against morality.” A number of clergy-
men were present, but no bank officials of pious
proclivities turned up. All were agreed that holy
men, strict pietist wa°hed-in-the-Fount gospel-
mongers, are the only fit and proper persons to
represent an enlightened community, and that the
career of each M.P. should be examined with a
microscope, the goats sorted from the sheep and
cast out; when the latter alone handle the reins of
Government, then for the millennium. The V.A.
is going to petition the Assembly to ejtct the vile 1
and unregenerated, but the Assembly won’t get
up and kick Itself out into the cold world, even
to make room for a spotless government, which
would legislate by inspiration. We advise this
useful society to turn its attention to the clergy.
Reynolds’ paper, the staunchest, and, in
tact, only radical journal in England, and which
has been one of Gladstone’s strongest backers, be-
gins to dread the absolute predominance of that
statesman, and writes vigorously against One man
Government. Be his proposal to buy out the
Irish landlords, it says:—“lP it were proposed to
present the Irish people with some millions of
pounds we could understand and sympathise with
such a proposal, but to give a single brass farthing
to the gang of robbers who have brought Indelible
disgrace on the English name Is beyond all human
endurance. It is surely the robbed and not the
robber that is entitled to compensation, if com-
pensation there is to be.”
Vanity Fair’s view of the English poli-
tical situation is that “the astute Mr. Chamber-
• sees that his aged patron Gladstone is
visibly coming to an end, and who, besides, cannot
endure the airs that Mr. Morley gives himself as
a coming man, has withdrawn his protection, his
support, and himself from the Cabinet, and is now
endeavouring to make friends with the Mammon
of unrighteous Hartington, in the hope that the
Whigs may receive him into their houses. It is a
move quite worthy of Joseph, and made at an op-
portune moment; for. having got rid of Sir
Charles Dilke, Joseph, if he can only trip up the
Grand Old Parliamentary Hand, would be, as he
imagines, in a masterly position as an ally of Lord
Hartington’s, next in dignity to that commanding
Marquis. In this position he reckons, no doubt,
that he would not have long to wait before he
succeeded to the leadership of the House of Com-
mons; for the Duke of Dovonshire being now 78
years of age, it will probably not be long before
Lord Hartington is himself removed to the Upper
House. That, no doubt, is the calculation.”
The following from an American corre-
spondent, appears in a London Tory paper of 3rd
April (five weeks, be it noted, before the Chicago
labour-riots reported here by cablegram the other
day):—“We are still in the throes of the big strike.
I believe that hard lighting between the labour
unions and the orderly citizens and capitalists is
merely a question of a year or two. The labour
unions threaten that, if they are locked out and
boycotted by the railway corporations and syndi-
cates, as is contemplated, they will plunder the
cities; and I see nothing whatever to prevent
them from doing so. They are far better men (so
far as fighting Jgoes), and far better organised,
than the citizens and propertied classes, and these
latter have no army or volunteers and no police,
or rather the police belong: to the labour unions,
who elect them. In the meantime, everything is
rising in price, law and order are openly defied,
and the courts are simply scandalous. The next
civil war cannot be far oil, and will probably end
in a strong military government.” So that is the
Tory forecast of a struggle to the death between
Men and Money I
The N.S.W. Government want money
while the Sydney streets swarm with mangy dogs,
and while in almost every backyard in every big
town in the colony there is at least one yelping
cur which makes night hideous and tortures the
sick. The present systematically-evaded muni-
cipal half-crown registration fee is a mere farce.
Dogs, blind men’s dogs alone excepted, are of no
practical use in the centres of population; they
are distinctly “luxuries,” and people who own
them ought to be made pay for the privilege of
annoying thoir neighbours. First-class dogs kept
either for ornament or for sporting purposes,
should be subject to a tax of 203. per annum, and
all un.ictnaed dogs should be so d by auction—
those which are umaleable should be summarily
destroyed. The police should be entrusted witn
the collection of licenses and should be given, not
merely (as at present) a capitation fee on vagrant
dogs captured and destroyed, but a larger reward
payable out of fines Imposed upon the keepers of
unregistered dogs. Such a tax would yield a
revenue of many thousands a year and would
abate a growing and unendurable nuisance, the
only present remedy for which is the secret em-
ployment of strychnine. We commend the subject
to the Treasurer’s attention.
Sir G. W. DesYoeux,late Governor of Fiji,
was, when he lived there, the best hated man
in those remarkable islands (which, by the way,
an old resident says, are drifting steadily down
towards Cape Horn.) A Fijian Junius wrote him
a valedictory letter, which was published in the
Fiji Times. We cull from it the following choice
flowers of diction:—
“In Demerara your name has a bitter savour. .
... on the reputation you left behind you at
St. Lucia it would not profit you to expatiate. It
is notorious that in F jlyour relations with the
community were the reverse of cordial. The
terms in which jour published despatches were
couched resemble nothing so much as the vituper-
ation of a superior tlshfag You have
been consistent in your disparagement of those
with whom you have been brought in contact, and
the latter have as consistently returned the com-
pliment. Have you the effrontery to assert that
it is they, not you, who aro in fault ? Go to! - you
know that you, and you only, are the culprit. I
vJSEu 70 ? ® onfes ? It as you read these lines,
me blush of shame Is mantling' on your velvet
yo i? r * hyaointhine noddle is bowed in
a»™i!?.H, onbe ™ r ? the tr uth.” Are there no
dungeons In Ijjl no racks no thumb-
screws ? If such a production as the above
? n B y dn ®y Paper the proprietors
would suddenly disappear from public view to
emerge no more till the final judgment. Fiji
must be a paradise for plain-speaking editors, At
the same time it may be as well to say that the
-,7® qu . ot ® was not published
until Sir G. W. Des Vceux had left Fiji for Europe
On the whole, we believe if we had to choose be-
tween governing Fiji and selling peanuts in Syd-
ney we would plump for the peanuts. The
colonists of Fiji seem to be an exceedingly wry-
necked lot. They hated Sir Arthur Gordon, who
introduced a regime of justice to the native race,
detested Sir G. W. Des Yoeux, who carried out
this policy; and are disgusted with Mr. J. B.
Thurston, the present Acting-Governor, who
treads in the path of his predecessors. It was a
cruel blow to them when they were prevented
from annexing at their sweet will the lands of the
natives and making the latter work for them
7.® r .J;h®y liked or not. We are not sorry
r jji is drifting’ down to Capo Horn. Wo oan grow
sugar enough in Queensland to make all the rum
we require.
More glory for Henniker Heaton! He has
been interviewed by the Pall Mall Gazette
which publishes his views to the extent of a
and a half. The first point we notice is
that Great’Ennlker was “ much struck with the
average ability of the House of Commons.” Such
an opinion, from such an authority, must be in-
tensely gratifying to Gladstone, Chamberlain, and
Parnell, and if we could only get their opinion of
Henniker our joy would be more than complete.
But, perhaps, they have not time to notice little
things. Henniker further told the Pall Mall
man that he‘‘felt quite at home in the House of
Commons. We have the same practice and proce-
dure in Australia. We quote May’s ‘Parliamen-
tary Practice’ just the same.” Please notice
the we. Anyone in England reading this
absurd speech would think that Henniker had
been in the N.S.W, Assembly for years v whereas
the solemn fact is that when he did try to get a
seat for a Southern constituency, on the Radical
ticket, he was “ licked yes, licked. Then
Henniker proceeds further Into the realms of
magniloquent romance in saying, “A year or two
ago I was sent to England by the people of Mauri-
tius to represent,” &o. This little island seems to
be a perfect mine of wealth for Hennlker’s repu-
tation. It is quite recently that he related with
becoming embellishments his own gallant conduct
in, as he puts it, “ rescuing despatches;” now he
goes one better by relating how he was onee a sort
of plenipotentiary for the Mauritians. In another
mall or two, we expect to read an account of H.H’s.
exploits when emporer of the islands. Henniker
concludes the interview by remarking that he has
a lot of new ideas about various subjects and
place o , including Mauritius, we .'suppose, and ex-
plains that Fair Trade and the housing of the poor
were the questions which earned him his majority
of 1000 at Canterbury. Touching this latter state-
ment, W. H. 8. Aubrey, the Liberal candidate’at that
election, writes to the Pall Mall asserting that it
was the beating of the tom-tom clerical, and the
support of the liquor interest, that worked most
for the “ representative Australian.” Mr. Aubrey
says: “ The saturnalia that prevailed in the streets
from dusk on the polling-day until long after mid-
night was a disgrace to civilisation.” Which only
goes to show what ecstacy Englishmen feel at the
success of a ‘‘representative Australian.” And
the use of this title leads us to wonder whether the
theologians will not wish for another revision of
the Old Testament Scriptures so as to make it
read, “And I said in my haste that all men are-
representative Australians.”

said “never mind. Is the Mudgea Indkpbndhkt

“ Ten Nights in a Bar-room ” comprises
the joy now meted out to the frequenters of the
Sydney Olympic. The piece Is patronised, as we
read In L’Entr’ Acte “by all the Temperance
societies In Sydney,” which makes us inclined to
believe .that temperance is not good biz. in this
sinful metropolis, for when we rolled up to see
the “ great moral drama,” there were about as
many people in the theatre as may be found in the
House when Dan O’Connor Isorating; but there
were certainly more than would remain in a
Methodist church in the suburbs while a good
healthy dog-fight was prooseding in the next lot,
• • •
It may be a humiliating confession of our
wickedness, but we are pained to say after witness-
ing this great moral drama that we shall prefer in
future to confine our attention strictly to such as
are not moral. This, in spite of the fact that this
colossal temperance lesson requires a striking
mixture of characters widely separated as the
poles for its representation. There is, first of all,
the good-hearted but depraved Yank, Sampson
Twitcher, who never feels better than when he
has three inches of corn whisky in the vicinity of
his diaphragm; then there is Simon Slade, the
stony-hearted landlord, also depraved, who, in
spite of the hardness, seems to have a fancy for
filling his bar-room with free drinks. The bulk of
the customers are likewise depraved to an alarm-
ing extent, the one oasis of virtue in the wilder-
ness of depravity being Mr. Romaine, the philan-
thropist. He is no slouch at temperance reform.
He just cruises into the bar, loaded cram-full of
lofty platitudes and fierce denunciations which he
fires into the depraved ones. Of course thess
volleys have tho customary effect —they increase
the revenue of the nearest pub. And they have a
like effect upon the audience. As soon as the cur-
tain falls upon Mr. Romaine, the men in the house
desperately grab their hate, and depart with deliri-
ous haste, to toss sixpences into the till of some
adjacent bar. Stay, this fact may be of political
importance. Let the Government compel the pro-
duction of great temperance dramas at every
theatre In the city, and the consequent consump-
tion of liquor will wipe out the deficit in a week,
—a new way of liquidating the public debt. Why,
oh, why are we not the Premier?
* * •
It is only just to the interpreters of this
magnificent moral lesson to admit that th<?y strug-
gle under the burden of their business with a de-
termination that verges on the heroic. But their
reward la not and cannot be anything like com-
mensurate with their gigantic effort.
** * *
“The Phantom Ship” still travels under
the Sydney Royal Standard but gives place on
Friday night to “ Othello,” to be followed on
Saturday by “ Our Emily,” a drama founded upon
Dickens' “Divid Copparfleld.” The patrons of
this theatre have enjoyed every comfort latterly—
they have never, (a tear here blots the slip,) been
crowded. The place was deserving of better
houses than those which greeted it.
to <0
“The Widow O’Brien” has played to a
crowded circle, a sudorific gallery, and a plethoric
pit, during the week, and seems good for a pro-
tracted trip. Martyn Hagan is Improving almost
considerably. It is hard work for an actor so
young as Martyn to represent a character so old
as Captain Cranbury, but he is gradually becom-
ing more able to bear bis weight of years. Sophie
Harris lands effusive applause in her whack of
“Trovatore;” when she goes for a top note and
knocks it out triumphantly you see the deep ex-
pectancy of the gallery god?, and once we heard
tho muttered tribute of admiration “ Thunder
wouldn’t she be a rum ’unj to hawk bananas!”
Taken all through, the piece goes as merrily as a
fat man falling down stairs, and the audiences are
as happy as they ever should be in the Gaiety.
*» * *
We do not forget Miss Emma Chambers.
Knowing “The Magistrate” would keep up a long
time at tho Royal, we held over Miss Chambers as
an interesting item with which to wind up our
notice of the show. She plays the part of Pop-
ham, a housemaidish young person, and is assured,
on the strength of a story in Bow Bells, that the
love of Cis Farringdon for her will never wane.
She makes a few snaps at a rival, Miss Marie
Brooke, who, in the character of a young lady
“ reduced to teaching music,” is also convinced of
the fixed nature of the young rake s affections.
Mies Chambers “snaps” in very harsh tones. A
pretty face and a harsh voice never go well toge-
ther. If the guttural emphasis must be there as
it is, a wrinkle or two about the mouth, a cast in
the ej e, and a piece broken off the end of the nose
would make tne character a congruous entity.

Miss Watt-Tanner takes a benenfit to-
morrow (Friday) night. A new piece of light tex-
ture and brief dimensions will reveal her in her
most smiling manner. The piece is called
“ Withered Leaves.”

“ La Fille de Madame Angot ” started her
career at the Sydney Opera House on Saturday
night, when the audience was such as managers
pray for-or, at least, would, if they ever prayed
for anything. And the audience throughout was
joyous to the very extremest verge of hilarity.
Miss Grade Plaisted was of course la fille char-
manic. Especially the charmante, for whether as
the ingenuous and naive little bride, tho guest of
the intriguing Lange, or her furlouily jealous
rival, she managed to get right home on the
affections of the house, from the gilded
circle to the palpitating pit, every time.
And Miss Lambert finds in her role quite sufficient
to make things hum all round when her business
is undergoing performance, for the character of
Lange gives a lot of chances in music and action
for the display of Lambertian ability. Miss Ella
Fenton is marvellously economical with her voice,
for though there is very little of it she makes it go a
very long way, and her song descriptive of the
character of the late Mrs. Angot is a decided
boom. The popularity of the chorus, too, helps to
make things pleasant, for the boys in the pit join
in, and this gives a sociable tone to the whole
affair.
* * *
Charles Harding is a vigorous Ange Pitou,
especially vigorous when he throws a boot (without
taking it off his foot too) after Pomponnet Just as
the latter is preparing for his wedding. The
interpolated song by Delaney and Hinohy in the
third act is not likely to become very extensively
hackneyed, for it is not particularly brilliant

Despite discouraging ciroumstauoes the

crowd. Her particular skill consists in keeping
herself inside a skipping rope. If she only showed
half as much skill in keeping Inside her clothes,
the attractiveness of her exhibition would becon-
siderably dlminished. What we mean by this is
that it Is impossible for a girl with a train to do
much dancing, and that if Lena wore long dresses
she would be less capable of showing her agility
to an ecstatic audience. Another new end moder-
ately startling performance is that of Madlle.

become as we are credibly informed by L’Entr
Acte the sensation of the day.” It is worth see-
ing, anyhow. We notice that Edith Wilson’s name
does not appear on the programme. Last time we
saw her among the Circle we were positively cer-
tain that she would catch her “ death of cold.”
We hope she hasn’t though. It Is much too soon
for her, to put a clothes— we mean close, to her
career.

The fame of the Sydney Alhambra has
penetrated far into the back country, and bush-
men (who, from their appearance, one would
judge to be totally ignorant of the existence of
such an instrument as a razor) now come tearing
on horseback over the spinifex plains and dreary
wastes, and through the box forest and cotton-
bush country, lying between here and Sturt’s
Desert and the Paroo, with one object in view—to
witness “ the entire change of programme,” which
tohes place every Monday evening at “the home
of minstrelsy and mirth,” as the management
modestly call it. Wa don’t mean to say that bush-
men are the only patrons of the Alhambra, for all
classes, from the bon ton of Potts Point to the
person who earns a precarious livelihood by dead-
horse and cattle removing, trundle round there
and enjoy themselves. The most popular item of
the programme seems to be Matlock’s singing.
When he begins in his modulated tenor to query
ohallthey meet again? ’ the house becomes as
still as a churchyard at midnight, and ihe audience
gaze with awe-stricken faces at his chiselled brow,
hhd when he finishes the high-toned portion of the
audience batter the floor with their sticks and
umbrellas until the rails dance out, old men forget
themselves, young girls weep, and the gods shriek
and yell “ankore” until he gives a repetition.
Minnie Hope and Nina Tulloch appear in a Dutch
sketch; Lucy Frazer, Amy Rowe, and Ida Francis
each sing ballads, and look lovely, the last men-
“.op®d ytmng lady, particularly, having very little
difficulty with the second item, although she
doesn t exactly rival Patti in the first. Mr. Arthur
Reed is a very much deluded young man. He
fancies he can sing comic songs, but he can’t, for
the simple reason that the songs he chooses to
sing have nothing comic about thsm. Mr. Reed is
a disciple of the J. C. Neild school of humour.
Our readers can readily imagine how dreary he is.
Mr. Glendall does a skipping-rope dance, for
which he deservedly gets much applause. Miss
Arnetta Scasi, from the principal Continental
theatres, and Drury Lane, Dubbo, and Mr. Har-
rington, serio comic vocalist, make their appear-
ance this week, for the first time at “ the home.”

This is what the three critics of three Sydney
dablea say regarding that unfortunate “Moon-
light sonata at Kowalski’s last concert. The
Herald:—“lt was not in accordance with the
standard of the best interpreters of the great
master.” The Telegraph“ His interpretation
was a great achievement, and would alone be
sufficient to pkee the artist in the ranks of the
foremost pianists o f the day.” And, last, but not
least, the Evening News (I)— I “The sonata in C
sharp minor was not so good: but this may have
been owing to the heavy character of the music.
We are unable to regard the Moonlight sonata as
anything better than a school-exercise.” 111

Mr. Dampier has been shocked, so we have
been Informed. It appears that a young and am-
bitious actor ventured to give that gentleman
some new readings of “Hamlet,” and suggested
new “ business.” “ For Instance,” said the young
man, “ in the speech ‘ As by lot, God wot,’ Hamlet
should speak the words ‘As by lot,’ and then
stamp upon Gutldenstern’s toe, who jumps around
in pain, and ejiculates ‘Godl’ to which Hamlet
reprovingly asks ‘ Wot ?’ ” Mr. Dampier replied
that he would write to Henry Irving and ask his
opinion upon the point.

Mrs. Isaac Selby, better known as Miss
Tessle Chapman, has lectured at the Sydney
Theatre Royal. Mrs. Selby has not been a nun.
She has “escaped from the quagmire of Roman
Catholicism, but has net plunged into the morass
of any other ‘ ism,’ and is content to walk on the
firm ground pointed out by the finger post of rea-
son.” The leoturess was introduced to tne audiecce
by her husband. We don’t know what ‘ ism ’he
has escaped from—we imagine Methodism, from
the twang he has retained. We are convinced he
acts wisely in taking a back seat while the
“ missus ” takes the flute- Mrs. Selby is a young
Irish girl, with a pretty Irish face, a fair turn of
Irish wit, and a gorgeous Irish accent. Her sub-
ject was: “Why I left the Roman Catholic
Church.” The lady has In her favour not only
good looks but also a good address and a clear,
sweet voice. On the other hand, her lecture was
delivered somewhat after the manner of a lesson
got by heart, in which the loss of one word is suf-
ficient to snap the chain of memory. Her lecture
is chiefly made up of anecdotes strung together
by pertinent remarks, most of which met the
approval of her huge audience. Some of her
stories are worthy of repetition. Twelve years
after the death of her mother she was taken to
task by a priest for permitting the good mother to
swelter in purgatory, He then demanded a good
round sum to be expended in masses for her re-
lease. Not at all taken aback she coolly told him
that, as he had allowed her mother to remain there
I.’ years, she was now thoroughly acclimatised and
therefore unfitted to reside In a milder climate.

“lolanthe” has had a three weeks’ re-
vival at Melbourne Royal. The cast was con-
siderably different from the original, and the
performances were rather different, too. Mr.
Thornton, as the new Lord Chancellor, struggled
hard to make us forget that Mr. Brough was
specially designed by Providence to play that
particular part. But we didn't forget. Miss Alice
Barnett, per contra, is the only Fairy Queen we
shall ever love. The character was made for her.
The Queen’s remark that she “ sees no objection
to stoutness—in moderation,” now possesses the
piquant flavour it lacked when Mias Trevelyan
reigned in Fairyland. That lady laboured under
the artistic disadvantage of not being stout. But,
with all, “lolanthe” has hardly been going with
the same go as of yore, and, on the33nd, “The
Sorcerer ” and “ Trial by Jury ” are to be put up.
They ought to go. “ The Sorcerer,” first produced
eight or nine years ago at the Opera Comique, gave
Gilbert and Bulliran the unique reputation which
has stuck to them ever since, it is a rather short,
but really funny, opera. Alas I for our departed
youth—how well we remember the first perform-
ance! The bishop who entertains a tender regard
for the pew-opener as “ a very plump and pleasing
person.” And the matter-of-fact Sorcerer, who
sells penny curses done up in packets of a dozen
each, and recommends his clients to lay down their
love philtre “ia the wood.” Ah 1 - but, no matter.
On the 33nd we shall meet again these friends of
happier days.

Brian Barley, the good-looking Gilbert
Vaughan of "Called Back,” would appear to have
finally severed his connection with George Rig-
nold. Although handicapped by a chronic huski-
ness, Mr. Darley takes a lot of beating as the
genteel villain of melodrama. That was bis usual
line while with Mr. R. He formed the dark back-
ground of wickedness which threw Handsome
George's virtue into bold relief—and limelight.
Talking of separations, Mr. Henry Harwood flgnts

purity in your ballad: there is pathos of a sublime

PEPPER AND SALT.
Adelaide is happy in the possession of a
*• Vigilance Association.” Its members constitute
the very cream of South Australian piety. Some
of them—such as Crooks, the bank manager, and
Walker, the Y.M.C.A. secretary—have immor-
talised themselves. Well, the Vigilance Associa-
tion held a meeting the other day “to consider
how to free Parliament from scandalous offenders
against morality.” The idea is to petition the
Assembly— don’t laugh I—to make a law preventing
scandalous offenders from sitting in the House,
We fear the Vigilants’ little joke will fall fiat.
The Assembly—on the strength of recent dis-
closures—is far more likely to pass a " Christian
Young Men’s Suppression Act,” with a special
clause providing for the extermination of curates.
Still, if the Vigilants be in earnest, we can suggest
to them—pass the banjo:—
“The Anglican Synod is now sitting in
Hobart. The want of sufficient funds was the
burden of the bishop’s address. to
dailypaper.—
It is about time that there was a Press
Censorship in N.8.W., if royalty is to he respected
any longer. For some time past we have regarded
the Yass Tribune with suspicion. That suspicion
has grown into a dread certainty. The paper is
disloyal. It dissembles no longer, but shouts this
out that the world may hear;—“There is at large
at least one human unit who is non compos mentis.
Ho it is who solicited the Prince of Wales’ opinion
as to the ‘hundred best books.’ The idea of
existing Royalty criticising Genius is indeed
charming. Wo don’t suppose H.R.H. could—bar
metallioians-name a hundred books. That he
has not read the number in question is almost a
certainty. Now if it had been a question of who
were the hundred prettiest members of the demi
monde, Albert Edward might been have appealed
to with safety, being in such matters a connoisseur
par excellence."
HIS EXCUSE.
WAITING WIFE : “Now you just thought
you’d sneak up-stairs with your shoes in
your hand so’s I wouldn’t know what time
you got home, but”
SURPRISED HUSBAND (interrupting): “No,
no, my dear; ye see I lost the tram, and the
walk home blistered my feet, so I had to take
’em off.”
A most appalling responsibility has been
thrown upon us. We have the authority of the
Geelong Times for announcing that at the opening
of the latest London show ‘‘Queen Victoria was
presented by the Prince to the representatives of
the Australian colonies.” Then we are to be sad-
dled with her! Part of the Imperial federation
scheme evidently. Quick—a lively air, please;—
We take this from the order issued by
Lieutenant-Colonel Trice, of the Victorian
Mounted Rifles. It refers to the examination of
probationary officers. '* Fertility of resource
when in difficulties will form part of the practical
examination.” There is scope for much ingenuity
here. We will make a few suggestions for the
benefit of the candidates:—
(1) When you come to this part of the examina-
tion paper, boldly call the examiner aside, and ask
•
him to tell you confidentially, as between man
and man, what the correct answers are. You
might then ask him for the loan of a Aver till the
next week.
(3.) If you cate to give Illustrations of what you
think your fertility of resource would be when in
difficulties you might bear in mind the following
hints:—
Question (say): If, in time of war, one of your
men started for home what would you do with
him ?
Answer: Spare him, so that he might be com-
pany for me when I struck for home.
Question (say); What would you do If your
horse threw you while you were charging down
on the enemy’s square ?
Answer; Lie where I was till the trouble was
over.
Question (say); What, in your opinion, are the
most vital parts of an army ?
Answer: The bread-waggon and the beef-van.
Question (say): If you wished to lead the enemy
into a trap, what would you do ?
Answer: Leave the canteen unprotected.
These are only a few illustrations of what we
would consider straight replies to questions con-
cerning our fertility of resource. But they may
answer the purpose for which they are Intended
and that is all we care about. And now we will
take a drink.

HOW TO DO IT.
Can a cove with a broomstick sweep backwards
the surges
That roll, day and night, o’er the shingle and
sand,
Singing ever the same sullen, sad, ceaseless dirges
For the loved and long-lost ones that ne’er shall
sight land
Till the day when the ocean yields up all who’re
sleeping
On Its cold briny bed? No, he can’t-and we’re
sure
You’ll have just as much luck with this project of
keeping
Your Parliament pure.
They’ll get In there, somehow, there’s naught can
deter ’em—
These black sheep that bring the dark taint in
the fold:
People work for ’em, plump for ’em-seem to pre-
fer ’em;
For e’en as it was in the ages of old,
When King Solomon ruled, and King David, his
father
(Two lawgivers, they, who—we all must allow,
Took more than their share of life’s pleasures,—
yes, rather!)
Just so it is now.
01 grim champions of virtue, that rejoice o’er the
failing
Of weak “friends and brethren ” who fall by the
way—
Keep a watch on yourselves, for we read of your
nailing
The funds of the banks and the Y. M. C. A.
For your present crusade—it is mad, idiotic;
Would you ask men to round on each other’s
amours?
Men, whose morals, maybe, are no whit more
chaotic
Than are yours.
01 children of light, with black coats and smug
faces—
Chill Christians, un-Christllke—now hear and
take heed;
From those kindred “ offenders,” who sit in high
places
And hump round the plate, let your churches be
freed,
Then, if you still dream of expelling each sly fox
That sits in the House, you must work out a plot
Like the one which, of yore, brought such trout' le
on Guy Faux—
Blow up the lot!
We need no blessed ghost, we wi3,
To tell us that.
We know the burden always is
“ Pass round the hat I”
The sleek young curate learns it soon.
The phrase comes pat
At morning prayers or afternoon,
"Pass round the hat I”
Bush-preacher, bishop trained with skill.
Or parson fat,
The burden of their speech Is still
“ Pass round the hat I”
Prom year to year men still remain,
Sit as they sat
For years, to hear the old refrain,
“Pass round the hatl”
What do we hear ? That God is good
And man a vat
Of rice, and (this is understood)
“ Pass round the hat 1 ”
We’re getting somewhat sick of each
Church-acrobat.
The same old tricks, the same old speech,

Are palling on us, and, methinks—
But hang all that!
Life’s short enough—we’ll shake for drinks,

ALAS! SIR PATRICK.
A Queensland paper, referring to political
matters in N.S.W., speaks of "Mr. Jennings.”
This is too much. The thigh-bone and the muffled
drum, please.—
Alas, and this is the reward
Of patriotic labours past,
That you should be referred to as
Plain Mister Jennings at the last.
They know not of your fame, your rank—
These next-door neighbours—what a star
You’ve been, so you may judge from this
How small a great man, Pat, you are.
In your city, foul maligner, (by the way, is Yass
not a city ?)
You may sit and pen whole TniBUNE-fulls of
similar mendacity,
But although upon your readers your audacity
may palm a lie,
It can’t on us—the Prince is of a literary family.
No judge of books, you think I Wo think it’s like
your Yass stupidity;
Don’t you know the Prince has often read with
profit ana avidity
His mamma’s work, which tells in language plain
yet terse and pointed, with
The tears on every page, what poor Brown’s sore
legs were anointed with ?
Don’t you think the Prince must hold this little
book, so calmly beautiful,
As next the Source of England’s Greatness, and, if
he is dutiful
As son and critic write “ best hundred volumes:—
the Divine; of it
One copy; mother’s Journal in the Highlands ;
ninety-nine of it ?
MERCY!
This is more than we can bear—
The news has knocked us down;
Will they send her over here
With her sceptre and her crown?
Must this country find the brass
To support a tinsel throne?
We have come, alasl
To a pretty pass—
The Queen is all our own.
We would feign decline the gift
Of this awful incubus;
Oh I ’twas mean of Wales to shift
His most gracious Ma on us;
We had stood erect till now:
But the seeds of shame are sown—
We must learn, somehow.
To scrape and bow,
If the Queen is all our own.
Court morals, manners, dress
Seem to Abigail divine;
But, for our part, we confess
They arc scarcely in our line;
In the course of llecting years
We quite grovel-proof have grown,
But sneers and jeers
Must change to “ cheers ”
The Queen is all our own.
This is the meaning of
“ Federation,” then, ’tis clear—
We have got to take the Sov.
And support her over here;
Oh! if it’s not too late,
Let our protest be made known—
That we’d rather wait
Ere we federate,
So, " Britons hold your own."
JOHN BULL ON THAT SUBJECT.
Joyful tidings I One more figure
Come to swell the lengthy list—
Boon to grab the people’s money
With that little dimpled fist.
Joyful tidings 1 Tell us, then, of
What do tidings ill consist ?
More than twenty little princes
And princesses, plump and fat,
At the present time are being
Trained to carry round the hat.
Must we hail with joy the advent
Of this newest royal brat!
Does the little mouth, just opened,
Eat the bread of honest toil ?
Does its father earn the wherewith-
al to make his kettle boil ?
Deuce a bitl the ducal dada
Merely scrambles for the spoil.
Joyful tidings I Jubilate !
Let us grin and bear the blow,
One more little German princelet
Born to reap what Britons sow I
Oh I when comes the next arrival,
Head the awful message, “ Woel”
TO PLAINER TOM.
It is known that Campbell feared to write
much after the publication of “ The Pleasures of
Hope,” lest he might endanger the reputation won
for him by that fine poem. Tennyson has reached a
height of song that Campbell never dreamed of
aspiring to. There is probably nothing in the
whole range of ancient and modern verse more
exalted and Inspired than the “ Passing of Arthur ”;
and “ Enoch Arden ” is the perfection of domestic
pathos. “ The Palace of Art ” and the “ Lotus
Eaters ” are jewels that should, “ upon the
stretched forefinger of all time, sparkle for
ever” as he has (rather awkwardly) written. Yet
this Isolated Titan of song doesn’t seem to care
much for his reputation. The man who wrote
“Lady Clara Vere de Yere” and “Aylmer’s
Field,” the one a manful and daring, the other a
pathetic protest against Title, has debased his
genius by becoming a lord; the hand that
penned the great “ In Memoriam ” has stooped
to perpetrate “ Hands all Round I ” And
his last outrage, the Indo - Colonial ode,
is simply a trumpet-toned appeal to tb e
public for dead cats. Beshrew us If we have
a poet about the place who would for untold
rum put bis name to such garbage. And the

Justice Kerferd, of Victoria, ig a shocking
example of the effects of political junketings.
For years, the ex-Attorney-General (the friend of
both sides) has been a prominent figure whenever
the lions fed. At official spreads and semi-official
picnics the courteous Kerferd bore himself as a
man must do who means holding ®n to a snug
billet. At the back scratching dinners which sig-
nalise the departure and arrival of brother tollers
to and from Yurrup, Mr. K. was usually to be
found in the flesh. Butnow.ahl now, a change
has come o’er tho spirit of the Kerferdlan dream.
Dyspepsia has crept u pon tho J ustice in tho autumn
of his life. Only last week he had to decline an
invitation on the melancholy ground that “ his
health does not permit him to indulge in ban-
quets.” Ho has climbed the ladler of fame-but
at how great a costl
The other day some heartless person in-
serted the following advertisement in the London
Era:-"Wanted, ladles, 100 for ballet, 50 for
chorus. Only experienced persons need apply.
Good salaries and expenses when on tour, lo
commence immediately in London. Half salaries
rehearsing. Apply any day this week (except
Saturday), to Mr. Hawkins, 13 Cleveland-row, St.
James’.” The consequence was that on the fol-
lowing Monday large numbers of the ladles of the
ballet and female choristers were seen wending
their way towards the residence of Sir Henry
Hawkins, the eminent judge, who lives at the
address in question. The neighbourhood was
thrown into a state of wonder and surprise; and
the procession of applicants past the windows of
the clubs in Pall-Mall excited much curiosity
among the inmates. It was not until Sir Henry
Hawkins’s butler had seen and dismissed several
hundreds of the shamefully-tricked fair creatures
that the constantly-increasing crowd became fully
aware that the advt. was a cruel hoax. We don’t
see it stated that Sir Henry Hawkins complained
of being called upon by ballet-girls. It isn’t likely
he would, if we may judge from the trouble taken
by certain eminent ornaments of the Sydney Bench
to make the acquaintance of the ballet. E/en
judges arebut mortal, and some of them in Austra-
lia are very mortal indeed.
First wife : “ And so you say you have hit
upon a plan for keeping your husband at home
every night. How ever do you do it ? ’ Second
wife; " Well, you see, I have hired a young and
handsome governess for the children, and just
after tea I get her to take the little ones into the
parlour where I leave the lot with my husband
while I go into another room, but never out of
hearing. The governess, being a novelty and very
attractive, Richard remains under the pretence of
amusing the youngsters, and starts telling the
governess fairy tales and lying to her ab out what
a big man he is in the city, and carrying on just
the same as if he wasn’t the father of five children
and hadn’t a bald head and enough lumbago in his
back to kill a tiger. When 9 o’clock comes, I start
the governess to bed, and, of course, it’s too late for
her old lunatic admirer to remember that he has an
engagement down town, and I have him all the rest
of the night to myself. Isn't it just grand ? ”
First wife (sadly): “ Well, yes, it appears to
act all right in your case, but it would never
do in mine.” Second Wife : “No ? Then
can’t you try soma other plan?” First
Wife (despondingly) : " Hardly. The only
plan I know to keep Fred, at home would be to
set up a bar in the parlour, and sit and shake for
drinks with him until 3 o'clock in the morning.”
Second Wife: " Dear me, Claw, I fear your case is
hopeless, for if a smart stylish governess can’t
keep a man at home aftar dark, how on earth can
his wife expect to do so. Take a little spiff of
* Florida.’ ” I

In the N.S.W. Assembly Mr. W. Clarke said he desired to bring under the notice of the House certain information he had received from the Government in reply to a question
he had asked. The question he had asked with-"1. What number of copies of a book called the 'Australian Portrait Gallery' was purchased by this or poevius Government.
and by whose authority? 2. What was the total amount, and from what fund was the money paid?" The answer he received was that 500 copies of this book bud been [?]
by the Stuart Government at a cost of £600. The book contained the portraits of a large number of political celebrities. Some of the sketches were culogislie, others were
scandalously libellous, whilst, on the other hand. it was published in eulogise the political character of some of our public men. It was a place of extravagance which he thought
the house ought not to tolerate, and the best thing would be for it to refuse to pay the money, and make those gentlemen who had been eulogised pay for it themselves, He asked
what had [?] of this "Portrait Gallery?" [An Eon. Member: Sent to Amsterdam.] At any rate, the gentleman who authorised the expenditure ought to be reprimanded by
the House. The expenditure of that £600 was typical of the extravagant waste of public money during 1885. (Hear, hear.) He thought it his duty to bring this matter before the
House and the Country, so that they might know who was responsible for that waste of £600.


“ Tell me your company and I’ll you who

tion, the Churoh of England book depot, and the

It was thought that the picnic arranged
for last Saturday by the R.S.Y.G, to their Commo-
dorc ' l ' Mr. James Fairfax, of the S.M. Herald.
would have been postponed out of respect tor the
memory of Mr. Hugh George, the Herald’s
general manager, who died suddenly on Fridav
night. Reading between the lines of the Gover-
nor’s feeimg speech on the occasion it would seem
hlu Excellenoy was somewhat surprised to
find that some of Mr. Georges closest and moat
intimate friends could bring themselves to attend
a jovlaf pionlo almost before his unburied bodv
was cold, ’
Hugh George.
The mala points of this good man's life have been
fairly and adequately set forth in the Australian
papers -when and where he was born, how he be-
gan life, how he achieved success, how, for five
and thirty years he was at once the figure-head
and main-spring of the biggest newspaper work In
Australia, all these things are found in the records
of the day. Nor has that one big episode—the Im-
prisonment in the Victorian Parliament House-
been missed. All has been told, and well and
kindly told, for each recording scribe was the old
man’s friend. Nine out of 10, Indeed, were under
direct personal obligation to him—the cherished
obligation which grows with years of kindly
counsel and sympathetic friendship and guidance.
Hugh George was a big man. Any good pressman
is a big man, and the man who manages pressmen
aright is somewhat bigger perhaps at least in the
patience, tact, and self-control which are the
lubricants and governors of all the gear of
life. But, while acknowledging the ade-
quacy of the record already made, we feel
that there is something for us to say-
something that folks generally will care to hear,
and that will help them to remember the men they
knew, or to conjure ud the man all pressmen
loved, and all oitymen of Melbourne and Sydney
honoured and esteemed. We want to paint the
little men, dressed usually in grey, gray through-
out. His hair thick and close cropped, had
scarcely changed in colour through the past 10
years. We remember the hair and board always
of the same fine healthy grey. The eyes gray also,
though with a light of blue, like the Hash of steel
when on occasion they did flash; and clothes al-
most always grey. A little man in grey, for he
was not more than sft. (fin. in height, but well and
strongly built, straight and square in body as in
mind. So all those who knew him remember him,
seated during his Sydney career in the little room
on the first floor of the Herald office; his door
always open, his ear, heart, and understanding
also.
I remember in the winter of last year,
when half a dozen pressmen and “the old
man ” in the midst of us (for we never if we
could help it started without him) passed a
glorious time on Lake Narrabeen. It seems but
yesterday that pleasant calm grey day. The old man
in the stern rf the boat, suggesting quietly that it
might be better to take a man along because there
was an after-dinner time to be considered when
“exertion spoiled good conversation,” and oppos-
ing a certain proposal to climb up to a Trig-station
on the shore, he “ having arrived at a time of life
when mountain heights wf re matters upon which
it was always well to accept existing evidence.”
And how genial was he over an after-dinner glass
of wine I—how keen was his appreciation of every
little vein of humour that sparkled across the
surface of common-place talk I Bhcul ’Tis scarce
a year ago. But there is another time somewhat
farther lack when the old “Vag.,”not in very
good heart just then, was quitting Sydney, and a
few of us agreed to give him a bit of a send-off.
Would Mr. George come ? Of course Mr. George
would come—wby on earth shouldn’t he come?
If It was anything to help one of the cratt along
we might know he would always come. And he
did come, satin the chair, and when the proper
time arrived got up to say just the pleasantest and
best things one man could sty of another, to put
all the shining facts he knew together, and to give
the man himself such a picture of himself as must
needs stir him up like good old wine whenever he
thought about it.
One of the best pictures I have of Hugh
George is in connection with that little
dinner, one amongst many. ’Tls easy to
recall the Manly Beach trips of course,
the Saturday afternoons and Sunday morn-
ings, when the bothers of the work were
blown away. All travellers by those boats
must have known the little man in grey. But
there is just one other memory, and It is so recent
as to be almo&t sacred. It is Indeed but of Wed-
nesday last, the day upon which Mr. George left
Sydney for Melbourne, that by one of those pecu-
liarly iortunate strokes of fate which come to us
all at times, I. the writer, walking up Bent street,
met Mr. George by the side gate of the Union
Club. And we stood beneath the shade of the
trees there and talked awhile. There was no
reason why we should have stood so. It was 10 to
one that we should have passed with a nod. But
he baited, stood over by the fence and said, “How
are you getting on?” And so we began to talk-
first of men, all the pressmen in the city. It need
not be said that he Knew them all. Then df mat-
ters, Press matters, of course. He talked of the
Herald, and now It seems to me more as one who
reviews the past than with any large interest in
the future.— of the other daily papers of the city,
of this Bulletin, in wnicb, some years ago, he
had a considerable interest. He knew what they
all should do, be could make good guesses at what
they all would do. He predicted the future
of each, sketched out their proper and
legi inate lines of develop! eat; showed the
bye-ways they would probably enter, and
the certain loss and probable defeat they
would find. And alter a good half-hour thus he
spoke sorrowfully and briefly of himself. He was
not well—there was something about him he could
not understand—he would take a turn in Mel-
bourne. and might come-to amongst his old asso-
ciates, “ but if things do not change shortly—well,
it’s all up.” So we parted, and two minutes later
I saw him turn into O’Connell-street and pass out
of my sight for ever. It seems strange to realise
it now, hard to understand that we are talking
about a man whose living human form has gone to
dust and ashes-who will be missed from his old
haunts here henceforth for ever. But, so it is.
Gone as we all must go, and, putting all customary
cant out of the road, gone in the best possible
way. He had said good-bye to us all in Sydney,
and he wanted to go down for one more look in
Melbourne. He had his look. Just one day to
shake a thousand friends by the hand, and then
that something he could not understand made it-
self very comprehensible and took him away
suddenly, aod without much shook or pain, to
all those other friends from whom he had been
parted for days, or weeks, or months or years.
It is not, as is very well known, our habit to dis-
cuss the spiritual aspect of any matter, but, going
out of the way for once we may say that Hugh
George, though not much of a Presbyterian, was a
good deal of a Christian. Me did not bother
churches much, though whenever a good church-
man stood out of the ruck and shook away his
fetters he found the old blsnop amorgst the
preachers and teachers of the Press behind him.
The old man died in his club, living his useful and
genial life, and caring very little for the things to
be. He would have died just the same in his bed
had it been his ill-luck to have had his life-thread
fretted away by weeks of painful illness. He had
fought a very good fight and covered a very fair
field of duty, and trained and disciplined for 64
years a good honest-working soul. If it falls to
him to continue on in any otner style of existence
he won’t need to put back much, for the sort of
work be was mainly given to was what may fairly
be termed of righteousness-useful and accept-
able and rare in this world, and beyond doubt
welcome in any other.
THE CORNSTALK IN LONDON.
ENGLISH GOSSIP. PROM “ THE BULLETIN’S”
AGENT-GENERAL,
London, Bth April.
Dear Bulletin,—Sir Alexander Stuar
has “come to hand” at last. We have been
anxiously expecting him tor some time. Not,
mind you. that he is particularly required. That
£lOO a month and a trip to the old country is easily
earned. The backbone of the work which should
have been Sir Alick’s in connection with the pre-
paration of the N.S.W. court has been broken by
your indefatigable Agent-General, with the
valuable assistance of Mr. George C. Levey. I
may venture en passant to express the opinion
(probably it has been more ably expressed before)
that the appointment of Sir A. Stuart as N.S.W.
Commissioner to the Indian and Colonial Exhibi-
tion was a piece of absurd extravagance (N.S.W.
can at present afford to be extravagant 1) and mis-
management—not to breathe the objectionable
word ‘‘jobbery.” The other and at present mere
financially stable colonies, with economic wisdom,
appointed their respective Agents-General to the
duties. Clever N.S.W., which must be singular in
everything since the Soudan fizzle, withheld its
confidence from Sir Saul Samuel, who (not to
draw a too close comparison which might be cm-
sidered odious) is at any rate far from being the
least able of the Agents-General, and sent over a
worn-out paralysed statesman—l shou’d rather say
politician, whose reign of power has been more
disastrous than that of any other man within the
history of the colony.
* * *
Well, as I was saying when I interrupted
myself, we have been anxiously expecting the
missing link that has done so much lately to
strengthen the golden chains which bind the
colony to the mother country. I have often re-
marked that giddy young Australians en route to
England, via America—medical students and the
like—almost invariably suffer “unavoidable de-
tention” in New York, and have been inclined to
suspect that the notorious gaiety of the American
capital has much to answer for in that respect.
But what are we to think of the case of an elderly
gentleman of remarkable appearance who has
been non est inventus for tome time ?
• ♦ »
Our uneasiness while this “mysterious dis-
appearance” lasted has been painful to witness
and hoar, but thank heaven! it is now over. The
great man has arrived, looking a little played-out
it is true, but slid with the unmistakable air of
K.C.MG. about him. I have been fortunate
enough to know Sir Alexander by sight (I could’nt
mistake him if we met at a dog fight!) since I was
an enfant terrible, the beloved of the “ tom-boy ”
schoolgirl, and the abhorred of the orchard owner,
but many of my acquaintances here have never
had the pleasure ot setting eyes on your com-
missioner, and I am daily pestered with requests for
an introduction. These requests I feel, as an Aus-
tralian, unwilling to comply with. Why, oh why, if
you m ust send a representative did you not pack off
that clever showy and effervescent Dailey or the
pompous and aristocratic Jennings? Surely you
might have well spared at least Sir Patrick for
twelve months!
m * *
Apropos to the arrival of Sir Alexander
Stuart, i may mention that an impression is fast
gaining ground amongst English people that New
South Welshmen are below the average biped in
physical charms, and I have been to same pains to
point out (I should certainly be rewarded by the
colony with a purse of sovereigns or be recom-
menced for a O.M.G -ship) the erroneous estimate
formed by the observation and inspection of
persons who have certainly come from the
colonies, but who originally went, or were sent
there. Am I wrong in suggesting that Sir Alick
(par exemple) is indebted to Scotland for his birth
and to " Ueelanders ” for his beauty, while N.S.W.
can only claim the honour ot having fos-
tered his genius! in these arguments, lam
also able to point to our cricketers. Surely Bon-
nor is good-looking enough to answer all neces-
sary purposes, while Murdoch is quite too tran-
scendantiy lovely. Ted. Evans, it is true, will not
more than pass in a crowd, andSpoflorth is but so-
so; but so-so is good—very excellent good—with a
lump of leather in his fist, and the Englishmen in
the summer will be too busily engaged in the
effort of keeping their bails on to admit of a criti-
cal analysis of the features of either of those
heroes. When these arguments fail to convince I
have simply to assume a graceful pose and re-
mark : “ I am a born Australian, and so is my
friend Patchett Martin I”
* 9 .9
Talking of the cricketers reminds me that
Alick Bannerman is left behind this time. Alick
is another of the famous Alicks I have had my
“ Umpa ”on since my knickerbooker days. I re-
member, when he worked at Aloock’s Tannery,
watching him play with a local club of a Saturday
afternoon on that piese of unclaimed ground at
Bnmore. Later on, if my memory is not as frail as
Tom Garrett’s supporters, Allckwasto theforeasa
storeman in the mercantile house of S. De Ltssa
and Co., in Barrack-street. His cricketing genius
afterwards pushed him up in the world, a place
was found for him—and one for Charlie, too—in
the Government Printing Office, and Alick be-
came, and has since remained, no end of aswe.l,
with, I have detected to my sorrow, a disinclina-
tion to be reminded of eaily associations, just as
if be was not as good a man when he tanned the
leather, as he is now that he wears the pointed
boots and the dog-skin gloves I The bitterness of
the world was again Illustrated when I chanced
again to meet the diminutive but sturdy batsman
in Belfast, Ireland, in ’BO. Murdoch’s team had
come there to play 18 of the North of Ireland C C.
I was staying in the neighbourhood with some
friends at the time. Do let me tell you the story
of the match. It's rather a good one. On
the verandah of the pavilion I sat next to
an exceedingly handsome old man (a par-
son), who, i.i the course of a conversation
we entered upon turned out to be a poet, an
enthusiastic lover of the national game and a
brother of the then living Charles Badham, one
of the best men N.B.W. ever possessed. While we
talked the match progressed, and to the ecstatic
delight of the local element the eighteen had
decidedly the best of it In the last innings our
men ban to go to the wickets with a big score to
make up, and the task looked rather hopeless

I hurriedly mentioned the departure of
A. G. Taj lor last week. He was gone like a flash
of greased lightning. Within twelve hours of
the arrangements of the passage by Sir Saul, he
was on board with his wife and mother, and, 1 am
i lad to know, more comfortably quartered than
on the home journey. Stay I I am scarcely correct.
He is on hls“r.omo’ journey now. Australia is
home to the true Australian. The native who
repudiates bis birth place and speaks of England
as “ home ”is both a fraud and a fool, f regret
to say that I have met several of that “kl ney.’’
I am glad Taylor is well started, lor he was utterly
miserable here. Whether he would have been In
such a burry to depart if he had been staying at
the “ Grand ” and parting hundreds instead of
iretting ms heart out with empty pockets in Chob-
ham-road K., Is a question we need (not discuss:
but don’t you think it a pity that his trip afforded
him a glimpse only of the seamiest side of London ?
For instance, for a young politician to have spent
months within a ’bus ride of the House of Com-
mons, and not to have spent an evening within its
walls, is rather a distressing reflection. Mr. and
Mrs. Taylor had but two outings while here—they
spent a day at the Albert Palace (a new imitation
of the Crystal Palace at Battersea), and an evening
at Drury Lane Theatre. The West End and even
the parks, they saw nothing of, and they leave
utterly ignorant of the magnificence and oppres-
sive vastness of the world’s metropolis. We (the
adjective includes two or three Anglo-Australian
ink-slingers) were disappointed at Taylor’s sudden
departure, as we looked for the opportunity of
bidding him good-bye at some sort of a cheerful,
modest re-union we meditated fixing up. We
were obliged to content ourselves with wiring our
God speeds to Plymouth, from whence letters
arrived to-day, describing things as “All serene.”

Now let us gossip of the Murray-Smith
banquet. The committee—of which Sir Saul
Samuel was chairman—courteously sent me a
ticket. By the laboutsof my confreres you havo
probably bad a full, true, and particular account
of the whole affair in the dailies, even to the 7cey
of the hiccups which unfortunately seized the
Royal Duke, and the persistency with which our
mutual friend, Lord Rosebery, called for Irroy. I
may, therefore, confine my remarks to personal
adventures and impressions. I arrived on the
scene of action—the Freemasons’ Tavern—at the
same moment as Sir Alexander Stuart, and we
entered the reception rooms together. The
crowd had just commenced to strike a bee-
line for the banqueting-hall. What a lot
of them there were to be sure (over 300), and
such quiet, respectable, law-abiding looking per-
sons I Here and there I noticed a beetling brow,
and softly whispered to myself, “ Bt. Michael and
St. George;” and occasionally I caught a sunken
sinister eye, and knew that a hungry journalist
was enviously wondering where I have my linen
got up, or speculating as to whether the diamond
in my stud came from Brazil or Glasgow. Some
years since, when i was inspecting public buildings
in Sydney, the Houses of Parliament had a great
fascination for me, and I spent many hours in the
strangers’ galleries Well, the general appearance
of the visitors at the Murray-Smith banquet re-
minded me forcibly of the members of the Legisla-
tive Council. That should convey volumes of
close type to you. Nearly all the faces were familiar
to me, but I knew, very few of their owners. I
was fearfully nervous. I feared the Commander-
in-Chief might overwhelm me by offering me bis
snuff-box, or by mistaking me for Lord Rosebery.
The likeness between us la said to be remarkable.
I was also afraid to open my mouth lest 1 ad-
dressed some distinguished person in mistake for
a waiter, or vice versa. How absurdly incon-
venient it is, by the way, that the costume of
waiter and waited-upon should be so similar—
especially in these plutocratic days. I was nervous,
too, of being placed at table next to total strangers.
One never w hom one may meet in these
mixed assemblages. Fortune, however, was kind to
me. In the reception-room there were too many
aspirants for the )ionour of speaking to his Royal
Highness, or of even toucning the hem of his
garments, to admit of his seeing me and making
mistakes: I spoke to no one, and therefore made
no enemies, am when we scrambled to table I
found to my delight and relief that I bad fallen
among friends and had escaped the fate of the
man who journeyed to Jericho. On my right was
A. Patohett Martlr, and next him was placed his
“pardner” in the Anglo-Australian Agency
business, G. C. Levey, a C.M.G., it la true,
but is it not commonly said that “there
are good and bad of all sorts?” We, too,
—happy mortals!—were within a few yards
of the chair with its royal occupant, bathed
as it were in the effulgent radiance which, of
course, suirounds the Queen’s first cousin and a
grandnephew of that truly good and great man
George IV. It wa? appropriate in one way that
Messrs. Spiers and Pond, returned Victorians,
should cater for the Murray-Smith banquet, but I
regret to say that the management was not suffi-
ciently patriotic to rise to the occasion. The
dinner was sufficiently elaborate and fairly eatable,
but it might have been much better, and the nig-
gardly spirit displayed towards the close, and when
the talking and toasting began, was distressing.
Considering the difficulty,—almost the impossibi-
lity—of getting a bottle of champagne within hail,
the enthusiasm displayed was remarkable. At
one point it was a little tqo remarkable. When
your own Sir Saul—the only Sir Saul—rose to
reply to the toast of “ The Empire,'’ proposed in
an eloquent speech by Earl Granville, there were
noisy and prolonged cries for Lord Rosebery.
This was horribly bad taste and the worst of form,
but I iear that a knowledge of what is good form
and taste was not as general id the company as
might havo been supposed; Sir Saul proceeded
with his speech, which was short and statistical.
Later on, Lord Rosebery, at the request of the
chairman, satisfied his too ardent admirers by a
few words big with Imperial Federation. It was
about this time that I began to lose all apprecia-
tion in the proceedings, especially as no “smokes”
were on the table, and I had left.my cigarette-ease
at home.

A fair attendance put in an appearance at
Canterbury Park meeting last Saturday, when the
ground kaptun its unenviable notoriety for acci-
dents, Pirate, Galatea, and Gasket coming to grief
in the May handicap, the outcome of which was a
broken collarbone for John Gough. We have an
Animal s Protection Society which might well take
the jockeys under its wing, for youngsters in their
teens connected with racing stables, have as a
rule little more to say in the matter of a
mount, than a horse put to work with a galled
shoulder has over his trouble. However, the equine
receives the protection of the law, whilst the
youngster, who should be still at his mother’s
apron-strings, is allowed to risk his life over a
dangerous course. But then its the "sport of
kings.” doncherknow. One prominent jockey, at
least, thought discietlon the better part of valour
on Saturday, and we dare say there were a good
many more who would have liked to follow his
example, had they been at their free will, or could
have afforded to be so fastidious in the matter of
their mounts. The Flying Handicap resulted in a
win for Fuse, well ridden by yourg Kelso, who
beat the favorite, Mackay, by a nose alter a great
struggle. Eucalyptus at 6t04 on made a win
of the Selling race from Sundial. Florence
started at even money for the May Handicap, and
leading into the straight appeared to have the race
well in hand, but Davis eased the mare down, and
Hams on Ellington dashing up on the inside,
caught him napping and snatched a victory by a
neck, Binalong third Sundial won the Prince of

The meeting between Backhouse and

easy thing of it.

The llrßt match of any moment for the
Gardiner football cup came off on Saturday after-
noon. between the newly formed Gordon club and
the Universitys, when the Gordons put the Unl-

to nil. The Gordons are composed of renegades,
or, perhaps, we had better call them seoeders from
the Wallaroo, Red fern, Balmain and St. Leonards
clubs, and that they form a strong team is evi-
denced by the fact that they beat the University
club on its merits on Saturday last.

The match between the Warwicks and
Belvideres has so far been conspicuous for.the bad
form shown by both sides with the bat. Warwicks
were all disposed of for 76, the only double figures
being Hiddleston 13, Cottam 10, and Hume 18; and
the Belvideres lost three wickets for 31 runs. The
junior representatives in each team acquitted
themselves remarkably well, the form, confidence,
and patience exhibited by young Hume in this
his maiden effort, showing that we have not
yet heard the last of this youngster in the
cricketing world.

Contrary to expectation, the Wentworth
representatives totted up the highly-respectable
score of 163 runs in their match against the
Osbornes for the M'Quade Cup. Their success was
mainly due to the excellent stand made by
Dickens and Busober, the former running up 49
before he was run but.

The pugs across the herring pond have
been very busy since we received last exchanges.
First and foremost was the meeting of Jack
Dempsey, the “Nonpareil” of the prize ring as
” a ,? d ? eorge La Blanche!
The Marine, with small gloves, to a finish.
Dempsey is the middle weight champion, and is a
fighter. He weighs TOR. 81b, in con-
dition, is 34 years of age. and has never been
beaten, having won no less than 3T battles and
drawn four. ,T The Marine ” weighed list. 11b nn
the day of the flsrht, has done some first-rate work
in the ring, and it wrs thought would have
a good show of putting Dempsey into his little cot!
They fought 13 rounds, and a N.Y. paper thus de
scribes the finish of the contest:—“ Le Blanche is
looking wretched. Both his eyes are swollen and
disc- loured. His cheek is open nearly haf£wav
across. He seems desperate and disheartened
Dempsey sees it. and, dsshlng upon him, delivers
two heavy body blows. One-a staggering strakn
-lands just above the heart. The Marine totters
but with an effort makes shift to close and fight at
shert arm. ‘ Break 1' Tffi-y are apart vgain and
Le Blanch© is fighting desperately. But what is
the matter with him? His blowi are wild and
swinging. His legs are unsteady. He is get
ting groggy. Once he dashes his flat against
Dempsey’s neck, and then Dempsey plants a
sounding blow upon his face. B-fore lt Le
Blanche totters and in a moment he Is’fiat
upon his back. Dempsey draws back and
waits for him to rise. But the gory face is nnVt
half lifted from the ground before he sinks back
agiUn. And then a painful sight is witnessed. Le
Blanche is fairly knocked out, but the game heart
of the plucky fellow struggles to susteia him!
Again and again he tries to rise, sinks back, turns
oyer and wriggles on the ground like a worm.
Time is almost up. Already the second is
ing the battle, when the prostrate; man struggles
to bis feet, lalses his hands in an attitude of
offence, uplifts his battered visage and stag-
gers across the ring just as Dempsey springs for-
ward, and with a generous impulse, catches up
his vanquished foe and holds him in his arms ”

been planked down on Despot as though the race
was all over, bar shouting, yet he leaves Australia
a maiden. Somehow, the stable and the public
were never tired of finding excuses for their Idol’s
defeat. When he fell—which was frequently it
was always taken for granted that he must have
pome in alone barring the accident. Only once or
twice did this arch-deceiver show anything ap-
proaching good form, and then it wasn’t within
pounds of his trials. Taking Despot for all in all,
we should think he was about the most expensive
animal that Mr. White ever owned.

The world’s supply of gold from 1857 to 1881 was
£550,380 000, of which India imported during that
period £93,570,000. India thus took annually, not
for circulation, but for hoarding and for making
into ornaments (which are as much merchandise
as lead or iron) a sixth of the world’s total gold-
yield. in 1883-81 she consumed £4,750,000, or a
fourth of the whole yield. The gold-coinage of
Germany has from first to last absorbed only
£BO 000,0C0; that of the U. 8., only £33,000,003; that

"THE GERM OF LIFE IS ELECTRICITY.”
Dr. Scott’s Electric Corsets & Belts
AN ENGINEER’S TESTIMONY.
Mr. Robert Moore, engineer of the s.s. Northum-
bria, who holds two certificates of competency,
and has been trading in this port for the past 25
years, sends us the following statement:—“About
seven or eight years ago I sprained my back in lift-
ing an anchor, and from that time until I came to
you for a Beit, I never was well. Excruciating
pains In the back and muscles used to attack me
with alarming p ?rsistency until really I could never
depend on freedom for a single day. Having tried
so many things ineffectually, you cannot wonder
that I purchased your Dr. Scott’s Electric Belt
with considerable misgiving, but I am happy to tell
you that since commencing to wear it I have been
entirely relieved and have not suffered from any
of my old symptoms since. lam now completely
cured, and there are scores of men in the coastal
trade to whom I have recommended it, who, from
personal experience, can speak as highly of it as
myself.
DR. SCOTT’S ELECTRIC CORSET
For
HEALTH, COMFORT, AND BEAUTY.
IMPORTANT TO LADIES.
Mrs, Williams, of Millers-street, St. Leonards,
writes of these admirable curative appliances:
—“I cannot speak too highly of your Dr. Scott’s
Electric Corsets as a natural and scientific means
of relieving pain. For a very long period I suffered
from acute baokaohe-one of the most distressing
complaints of our sex, but I am happy to inform
you that since wearing your corset (Dr. Scott’s) I
have never once felt a relapse or a return of my old
symptoms. I consider them, Indeed, invaluable,
and frankly and earnestly recommend them.
DR. SCOTT’S ELECTRIC BELTS.
ALMOST MAGICAL.
Constable William Stapleton, of the Redfen
Police Station, has experienced some of the beneflti
of curative electricity in the form of Dr. Scott’i

siderably, says Mr. Stapleton, from muscular palm
in the back, caused through exposure and takini
cold in the execution of my duty during a heavj
rainstorm. You cannot imagine the amount o
pain and agony I suffered from this comparative!;
trifling matter, and it became so bad that I wai
obliged to consult our surgeon and obtain slcl
leave. Neither the one or the other availed, how
ever, and as a last resort I tried your Dr. Scott’
Electric Belt. The effect was almost magical. Th
pain seemed to leave me instantly, and I have neve
felt the slightest inconvenience from it. I hav
recommended your Belt to scores of my friends
and amongst others to Mr. F. Cavener, the hea
porter of the Railway Station, who used it wit
equally successful results upon a child of his

recommendation is of any service to you you

PALL MALL ELECTRIC ASSOCIATION'
54MARGARET-BTREET. SYDNEY
Woman Items
A Rochester (Eng.) postmistress is charged
with heavy embezzlement. Her defence is under-
stood to be a novel one. She is a somnambulist,
and says that she has secreted the missing articles
and money in her sleep, and now cannot find
them.
A lady (a perfect lady!) in Perth, W.A,
was recently charged with throwing stones at her
husband. The lady replied that “it was a family
affair,” and was at once discharged without a stain
upon her character. The rights of women are
beginning to be recognised in Western Australia
at any rate.
“ Two women have fought a duel in
France,” says the Evening News. All right. Let
the sweet creatures work off their bad temper
among themselves and then we shan’t all be going
about with scratched faces and a dent in the back
of the head where the teapot took us when we
weren’t looking.
“ Can’t afford to marry ” is a common ex-
cuse, but a young lady of Tumberumba (rumbling
ground) got over that difficulty by forging a £U
cheque, which the happy man duly invested. The
next difficulty will be harder to get over, and the
honeymoon will be rather eclipsed, as both are
awaiting the S.M.
It is easy to let a lady into a bath, but
terribly hard to get her out again. That at all
events is the complaint on the Queensland sea-
board. The devoted parties who keep the keys of
Sydney surburban wash-basins have had the same"
iron enter their souls. At Rockhampton, when
the janitor considers a fair allowance of time has
elapred, he puts his mouth to the keyhole and yells
** A man I” If a fellow philosopher will only throw
a brick on the roof at the same time, all his
troubles will be over.
It will stop many a Sydney woman from
running to the Divorce Court when Sir Alfred’s Bill
becomes law, to inform them that Queen Victoria
will never, no never, allow a divorced woman to
appear at Court. Even though the divorced woman
re-marry with all legal pomp and ceremony, the
rule is Insisted on. The secret of the Queen’s re-
morselessness in this regard seems to be that her
own mother-in-law —whom, of course, she hated—
was a divorced w Oman. Prince Albert’s mother
was divorced from his father in 1836, and was after-
wards re-married to Count Poelzlg.
Circumstances alter oasrs. A certain
Bathurst alderman had a cook of the female per-
suasion. She was a capital servant and seemed to
have been born In a boiler and reared under a
kitchen dresser. A few days ago she “knocked her
mistress silly” by giving notice that she was about
to leave. And, on being asked the why and where-
fore, she replied that as her father had, just been
elected an alderman she didn't think it would look
well for her to remain in service. Her father—or
rather her pa—is a butcher. And in all probability
a good butcher and a better cook have been sacri-
ficed in order that the former may enjoy the pri-
vilege of “ discoorsing ” on drains and murdering
Her Majesty’s English on every possible occasion.
Thus spake, ex cathedra, Cardinal Mo-raw:
•‘The Catholic church has never yet, and never
shall permit or acknowledge divorce under any
pretext whatever.” Is that so ? If it is, what are
we to think of a par. from the Bone corre-
spondent of the London Times which says “The
Pope has granted the divorce of the step-daughter
of Mlnghetti, the ex-Prime Minister, with Count
Banhofl. The young lady will now marry with
Count Bulow, so well known in London society.
Her mother was Miss Acton, who first married the
Prince Comporealle, and secondly Mlnghetti.
Fortunately for Mmo. Danholf, her marriage took
place in a town where the decrees of the Council
of Trent have not been promulgated.” The
church, like the State, has evidently one law for
the rich and another for the poor.
The MelbourneTiying-in Hospital, on be-
half of which Genevieve Ward organised a per-
formance of “Antigone ” (gratefully remenjbered

High-toned patronesses—who rolled up in dozens
so soon as Lady Loch smiled upon the Institution-
found the old title somewhat embarrassing, and
with a niceness approximating nastiness the com-
mittee re-christened It “The Women’s Hospital.”
Of course, it never was a men’s hospital—but we
are almost forgetting our point. The Women’s
Hospital bazaar is just now doing the best busi-
ness of any of the Melbourne shows. Raffles,
ttlrls, and art unions (baziars are rare shops for
heart unions) are among the leading attractions

Queen is honoured in the West, by the obeisance of

and served in the East by sempstresses who pawn
their shawls to buy a Sunday dinner.
Simultaneously with the news of the Chicago
riots, word of an exciting disturbance at Castle-
maine (Yio) reached us. A fascinating amazon,
the Rev. Miss Helen Hart—the “girl-lecturess,” as
she styles herself—(she Is a strong-minded female
who wears hand-made curls and was born some-
where about the fall of Babylon; waited on the
editor of the local Leader with a whip up her
sleeve and resentment in her heart. When the
scribe came forth she asked him in strained and
agitated tones how he dared to, and not receiving
a satisfactory answer forthwith, produced the
cattle-persuader and proceeded to be a mother-in-
law to him. She gave that editor Helen
but before her hate was thoroughly expended the
ungallant wretch handed her a severe back fall,
completely wrecking a valuable improver. The
“ girl-lecturess ” climbed on to her feet again with
alacrity, and then gracefully withdrew, leaving
the whip as a souvenir. The whip goes to the
editor; it is said that weapons left in newspaper
offices under such circumstances are always con-
sidered editor’s perks.
The Profane City (Q.) Benevolent Societyis
one of the great evidences of advancing civilisa-
tion in the North. The committee consists of
about 10 ladies, four gentlemen, and one old
woman; and its object, as the name implies, is to
pick up fallen sinners, brush the dust off them,
and then hold on to keep them from falling down
again. The business does not always progress
very well, it is true, for the ladies are rather given
to talking all at once, and the chair-female has a
bard time of it; but she does her best, and a n
angel could do no more. Her husband is also a
member of the committee, but he seldom speaks
HARD TO PLEASE.
HE: “AH, THERE, MY DEAR! IF I HAD MONEY I WOULD BUY THE WORLD FOR
YOU.”
SHE: "EVEN THEN I WOULD NOT BE HAPPY IF YOU WERE STILL IN IT.”
now, for whenever he gets up to address the
meeting' his wife calls bin to order, and
He consequently subsides. But as a charitable
organisation the society is a decided succe?a. No
wounded sufferer has to wait long by the wayside
in that town without a good Samaritan and an ass
coming along, though even there the ass generally
comes first—possibly because mules are always
more plentiful than Samaritans. Sometimes the
two are combined, thus proving that the ancient
fable of the centaurs was not entirely devoid of
foundation. Even the two-pance la not wanting,
though the aforesaid benevolent society, less
fortunate than the individual mentioned in Scrip,
ture, are not able to do their benevolence on
credit. Taking it all round, therefore, we can
only regard the institution as a credit to human-
ity, and we give it our best wishes—the only thing
which we can afford, in thess hard limes, to dis-
pense gratis.
Miss Cleveland, the American president’s
sister, has just revived the famous old controversy
about se dteolletant in the following letter:—“The
newspaper statements with regard to * my im-
modest dress and its influence in encouraging a
shocking scarcity of waist and sleeves in other
women's dress,’ has been sent me several days,
with accompanying comments, but always anony-
mously, so that I have been unable to reply, had I
deemed an anonymous communication honest
enough to justify an honest response. That has
not always been the case. I approve an evening
dross which shows the neok and arms. I do not
approve of any dress which shows the bust. Be-
tween the neok and bust there is a line always to
be drawn, and it is as clear to most frivolous society
women as to anatomists. This line need never be
passed, and a faaionable women's low-neck even-
ing dress need never be immodest. If it is so, it is
because she prefers to be so. It is wholly false, so
far as I have observed, that a shocking scarcity of
waist and sleeves mark the gowns of society
women. This is sadly and painfully true of a few
society women, and it is indeed shocking, nauseat-
ing, revolting, and deserving of the utmost
denunciation on the score of morality, beauty
health, and every other consideration which good
men should conspire to preserve and exact. There
is need of very few words on this subject and no
argument. Any American women can wear the
waist of her evening dress up to the lobes of her
ears if she likes. There is no queen to command
her appearance in low corsage. She can also con-
trive her dress that by the exposure of her person
all true social ethics and aesthetics as well are re-
volted. Between the two there is an appropriate
and beautiful modest mean which all can, if they
will, follow.”
Gentle reader, is your life insured ? On
second thoughts, however, this it a foolish ques-
tion to put, because you really do not know
whether it is or not. In England it has leaked out
that the irrepressible Insurance canvasser has
struck ou a new line and does quite a tidy busi-
ness by persuading persons to insure the lives of
others who will have no interest In the policies,
and no knowledge, in many cases, of their exist-
ence. Only the other day a man sought the advice
of one of the London police magistrate?, and made
a complaint that his beloved wife had Insured his
life, unknown to him at the time, for £3OO, and
that shortly after this she kicked him out of bed,
sethis night-shirt on fire, and fervently prayed
that he might be a corpse before morning. He
wanted to know if that was the correct thing for
a loving wife to do. His worship said it wasn’t,
because the wife who would raise her hand to
her husband was unworthy of the name of a Ber-
rltish woman, but, at the same time, however, he
was afraid the Insurance business would hold good.
This is a terrible thought, and perhaps it would be
as well, before Sir Alfred's Bill is through, to add
a clause making insurance of this character suffi-
cient justification for a No. 1 divorce. It’s a fear-
ful thing to be mixing up with one’s fellow-crea-
tures in apparent love and friendship, and yet not
be able to say for certain that some of them are
not wishing that their breath was a pestilence to
str ke you dead, so that they could go home and
do the “ Continong ” with your insurance money.
Only last month a policy of Queen Victoria’s was
put up for sale by public auction, and which of us
can say that his or her life is not in the market—
perchance in the pawn-shop even now. Competi-
tion is so great that some companies will take
great risks, and there are many of our dearest
friends who would think no more of taking the
chances on our lives than they would in taking a
ticket for a Sheffield Handicap consultation.

On Monday evening, the 17th inst., Mr. and
Mrs. C. J. Roberts, of Chatsworth, Potts Point,
gave a most charming and successful ball. The
guests, who numbered about 300, began to arrive
soon after 9 o’clock. Directly the gates were
entered one could not help being struck with the
beautiful appearance the whole scene presented
by moonlight. Mr. and Mrs. Roberta received
their (.visitors [at the entrance to the ballroom,
which apartment is really a delicious place: large
mirrors are suspended at short distances all round
the wall and reach from the ceiling to the
floor. The room was artistically ornamented with
lovely bouquets of flowers and ferns. The floor
was in perfect condition for dancing, the band
played in exquisite time at d most recherche refresh-

The Ashfleld amateur athletic sports meet-
ing was held at the local recreation ground last
Saturday afternoon. The handsome new stand
was crowded with visitors, who seemed much in-
terested in the races. As yet the turf on the lawn
Is rather too bald to make promenading
thereon an item of enjoyment. The bicycle race
was the most interesting event, and not a little
excitement was shown by the ladies during the
competition for the ladles’ bracelet. Mr. Arthur
Fry met with a nasty accident on his homeward
journey. His bicycle collided with a horse, the
latter showing execrable taste in kicking and
damaging the ankle of a man who was down. The
injured man was shown every kindness, however,
by the rider of the horse, who had him conveyed
to his residence with the least possible delay.

The eldest daughter of Dr. Jefferis was
married last Wednesday week to Mr. Kent, the
organist of the Pitt-street Congregational Church
Amongst the presents to the bridal pair was a
house full of furniture given by the congregation.
Dr. Jefferis, in his lecture on Sunday night, said a
man should never marry until his household fur-
niture was paid for, but he seems to forget that it
doesn’t fall to every man’s lot to have a father-in-
law whose congregation of several hundred strong
ire willing to provide the same Lares and Penates.

lace looped up with brown rosettes at Intervals.
A beautiful dress worn by a dark young lady was
of cream laoe and sprays of red roses. Pink was
not very plentiful, but one tulle dress of th

well. A chic costume was of white tulle wit
single loops of white satin ribbon. An atrooiou
gown was of bright blue silk mixed with brigh
maroon satin.

The Mayoress of Sydney held a receptio

who began to arrive about 3 o’clock, were re

16 performers played some brilliant and beautifu
selections during the afternoon, which added con

success of the reception. At intervals in th
music refreshments were served which wer
thoroughly appreciated. Miss Young’s costum

The tennis tournament is over at last, and
“ sassiety ” went on Saturday to the grounds
to see the victors and the survivors of the awful
fray obtain their prizes from the hands of our
own “ Queen of Beauty”—to quote a now his-
toric phrase. Before proceeding further let us
enter our protest agaiost the hideous dresses
worn by the lady players. With the exception
of Miss B. Metcalfe, who looked really charming
in white serge with blue trimmings, not a ten-
nisee (female for tenniser) was dressed with the
slightest attention to artistic adornment. Surely
a game that gives opportunity for so much grace
and pose of figure must readily lend Itself to a
style of gown at once suitable and attractive.
Lady Canngton was dressed in a dark-blue cos-
tume with white horizontal stripes; Hon. Mies
Harbord, in dark-blue with white spots, a stylish
high black hat; Miss Herbert Lord, a lovely French
?rey costume of cashmere and satin, bonnet and
ur cape to match; Miss Madden (Melbourne) in a
black silk gown trimmed with cardinal satin; Miss
Wrench wore a magnificent seal-skin coat which
completely covered her dress; Miss J. M. Purves
had on much yellow and blue canvas
costume; a Melbourne lady wore a striking gown
of maroon cashmere trimmed with rows of elec-
tric-blue velvet, bonnet and parasol to match;
Mrs, Charles Hogg In a becoming costume ot
golden-brown plush and canvas cloth, small brown
bonnet; Miss Weaver, dark-green trimmed with
old gold striped satin; Miss Cecil Griffiths, a hand-
some coat of dark-brown, alternate stripes of vel-
vet and satin, with maroon bonnet; the Misses
Watt dressed alike in stylish dark-blue frocks,
high black hats with scarlet bird in front; Mrs.
Risby, dark-green costume; Miss Gilder, bright
maroon cashmere and satin; Miss Metcalfe, stylish
dress of golden-brown cashmere; Mrs. Robinson,
dark-blue serge dress, braided in the front. The
number of gentlemen present included Judge
Wlndeyer, Lord Capel, Col. Bingham, Baron de
Tuyll, Captain Terry, Mr. Calvert, and many more
well-known men.

Many laides present at the reception given

We observe the following in The World

Capel, of [typhoid fever, at Monte Carlo, has oast a

as Miss Harford, she was very popular. She leaves
two little children, one of whom Is heir presum-

An item for men only. A Melbourne
tailor, the other day, sued G aorge Smith for £5 10s.
for alsuit of clothes supplied. George refused to
pay, and in defence stated that the clothes were
so absurdly out as to be useless. He tried on the
coat in court, and with tears in his eyes pinched
up a handful of collar showing a cavity beneath,
where you could stuff a trues of hay. He showed
how the seam down the back made him appe ir to
have a twisted spine, and as for the fit around the
hips, words failed him to express his disgust at
having his shapely pelvis so caricatured. He
argued justly that the human frame divine
was not a olothes-sereen for careless tailors
to practise their diabolical arts on, and
fairly broke down when he appealed to the
magistrates for protection, and asked them to
“only just look at the way the fello w had out the
pockets, and say whether any man of his build and
natural fascination could excite anything but con-
tempt from the fair sex and derision from bis
own.” The magistrates made Mr. Smith turn
round and round, and deciding that the tailor
must have thought he was rigging up a marlin
spike with a mainsail Instead of turning out an
unexceptionable and hitherto Irresistible masher,
gave a verdict for George, and made the man of
thread pay £1 Is. expenses. George has now
another coat, and goes forth conquering [and to
conquer.

Died, aged 24.
Dead! and the seat of silence set
Forever on those jocund lips,
Where mirth and music seemed to fret
Wnen bade to cease their truant trips.
Quench’d like a ray from star that burns,
His upward course to zenith height;
As placidly he earthward turns
The beam anon cloud-wrapped from sight.

Dead 1 with them trampl’d underneath.

When torn by rose-thorns bringeth death.

It has been proposed in America to endow a Col-
lege for the education of wives for the world—
that is to say, ladies who wish to reside in Paris,
Rome, London, or even St. Petersburg, are to be
specially educated in the language, history, cos-
tumes, and cookery peculiar to the country in
which one intends to marry. And, further t
it is proposed to educate ladies for class mar-
riages—for instance, to become the wives of, say
doctors or of lawyers. The scheme is rather
good, but it would be rather tiresome, to say
the least of it, if a girl fixed upon her own
destiny as, say, a doctor’s wife, and went through
the necessary training for the position, and found
when she was quite ready that there was no doc-
tor forthcoming with a proposal of marriage.
Even if she took the precaution to become en-
gaged to a man of her favourite calling before
going to the trouble and expense of training
at the Wife College, the proverbial “slip between
the cup and the lip ” might occur which would
spoil all her plans.
Of the lunatic notions put forward by
country grovellers for the purpose of testifying
their loyalty, and contributing to the pleasure of
Lord Carington, that of getting up a buck-jump-
ing exhibition "lays over all” for phenomenal
stupidity. At Bathurst, a loyal subject named
Yeomans generously offered to lend a confirmed
“ buoker,” and a still more ardent admirer of vice-
regal greatness namel Paddy Smith offered to ride
him, in order that the cup of his lordship’s happi-
ness might be filled. The confirmed buoker, how-
ever, being of “ dimmyoratlo ” tendencies, ob-
jected to being butchered to make a Roman holi-
day, and when the bowld Paddy mounted it was
found that there was no more “ buck ” in the hone
than there is in a dead cow. Tickling his ribs
merely made him sneeze, and when a blaekboy
cunningly placed a Scotch thistle beneath his tail
the confirmed buoker picked it out with his teeth,
and then laid down and began to fan himself with
it. Of course his lordship expressed himself as
being highly pleased with the performance, but
neither Paddy nor the blaekboy have ever been
seen to smile since. The Grafton people, how-
ever, went one better still by donating a
£3O buck-jumping prize, to be contested for
at their recent agricultural show. This
fared no better than the Bathurst exhibition.
The men were obliging enough, but the horje
proved to be the most intelligent animal again,
and burst up the business by falling over on his
rider, one M'Covey, who narrowly escaped being
killed. Lord Carington was so thoroughly delighted
with the Grafton performance, that he almost
went down upon his knees to beg the committee
not to do the thing again. How any sane man
who has the sllgbest acquaintance with horses
could agree to put up a £3O prize for the best
buoker is just a shade more than we can understand.
With proper handling, not more than one out of a
thousand horses will buck, and all that that one
is fit for is shooting. And yet this is the brute for
which the sapient Grafton show committee
offered a £3O prize, while th,e owner of the best,
tractable, saddle or harness horse had to content
himself with a plated pewter pot worth 30s. A
£3O fine inflicted on those who aided and abetted
the buck-jumping performance would suit the
case all over. Unlike the poet, the buck-jumper
is made, not born, and the sooner the “rough
rider,” as the bush horse-breaker is called, is
abolished the better. The people of Grafton
know this as well as we do, but it appears there is
nothing our country cousins will stop at
in their Insane desire to coax an approving vice-
regal smile or nod. The next place Lord
Carington visits should organise a cock-fight or a
dog or bull fight in his honour, or, better still,
might start the grand, intellectual old Cali-
fornian game of “ rooster-pulling.” The way it’s
played is this: Each competitor, having paid his
entrance-fee. seats himself on a log of wood, with
his feet firmly planted against another log. He is
then handed a rooster, and, placing it head down-
wards between his knees, he seizes the legs of the
unfortunate fowl, and gives them a mighty jerk
upwards with all his force. If he succeeds in pull-
ing the legs of the bird clean from the body he
wins the pool, unless the other competitors are
equally lucky, in which case a fresh coop of
roosters is procured. This, although not quite so
exciting as a buck-jumping exhibition, is far more
humane. The birds make no noise whatever,
being probably too absorbed in the Interest of tho
game to do so, and, besides, they can be served up
for the Governor’s banquet at night, and thereby
enable the reception committee to oopiblne plea-
sure with profit, whereas a buck-jumper is a dead
loss from start to finish.

The Dread Bright’s Disease Yields.
62 Dargharn Street, Lyndhurst, Sydney,
10th March, 1886.—“ During the last eight
months of 1883 I was laid off work, being
unable to leave my bed. I suffered the
greatest agony with pains in my scrotum,
down the inside of my thighs, across my back,
up the spine, ending in fearful headaches ;
my water was thick and muddy, I could not
rest in bed, or sit or stand very long in any
position. I tried several doctors, who told
I was suffering from a severe form of
Bright’s disease ; one advised me to go to
the hospital, as I could not live more than
a few months, being so far gone, A friend of
mine sent me a cutting from an American
paper wherein I saw a cure for Bright’s
disease, lat once wrote to Mr. Warner in
America, who advised me to get a dozen
•Safe Cure from San Francisco. (The
medicine can now be obtained of any
chemist in Australasia); I did so, and took
ten bottles, and from that time to the
present I have had no pains or trouble-
some symptoms, and feel in every respect a
different man. I have gained thirty-five
pounds in weight, and work hard every day.
Tho Distressing Diseases of "Women.
Alfred Street, St. Leonards East,
North Shore, Sydney, N.S.W., Bth March,
1886.—“ About three years ago I suffered
greatly from disease of tho Liver and Kidneys,
and without actually suffering much pain, I
nevertheless felt a disinclination and
general unfitness to attend to my house-
hold duties. My symptoms were a dull,
heavy, painful feeling across my back and
loins, between my shoulders, accompanied
with severe headaches. At the time I
commenced to take Warner’s Safe Cure 1
was suffering from Erysipelas in my foot,
which, however, after taking two bottles of
the Safe Cure, entirely disappeared. I have
now had seven bottles, and feel quite well.”
VILE WHISKY “BITTERS” WILL NEVER CURE KIDNEY DISEASES.
Unequalled, for Brain Workers.
Public School, Waterloo, Sydney, sth
March, 1886.—“ I have been a sufferer nine
or ten years, and during the early part of
.that time tried medicines from several
medical men of the highest reputation in
this colony, but with no permanent result.
I was told by one of the most eminent of
of them, whom I shall always remember with
gratitude for his unselfish advice, that no
medicine then known could cure me,
and mat drugs would only increase the evil
with greater rapidity. I therefore abstained
from their use, and wore as he directed, a
hydropathic bandage and paid strict attention
to diet, eating little animal food so as to
lighten the labour of the kidneys. The
disease, however, gradually increased as
evinced by the fixed dull heavy pain in the
loins, a burden almost unendurable, till my
attention was directed to the hints on diet,
etc., in the pamphlet surrounding a bottle of
Warner’s Safe Cure. These impressed
me so favourably that I decided to try the
medicine, and not without considerable fear
that I should suffer for my temerity. I
hazarded the trial of a bottP, the effects of
which were so satisfactory that I continued
their use till I had taken nearly eight bottles.
I now find myself free from the old too
familiar pain, and other symptoms indicate
a speedy recovery."
Sufferod for Eight Tears. STcw Well.
6 Dargiiam Street, Lyndhurst, Glebe,
Sydney, N.S.W.—3rd March,-1886.—“ It is
now more than eight years since I first
became afflicted with Kidney and Liver
complaint, but not until the last two years
have I been obliged to give up work. My
feelings were mostly a feeling of languor,
so great that I cannot express, with dizzi-
ness, and strange kind of mist floating before
my eyes. Being in a “ Lodge,” I had the
benefit of different doctors, but cannot say I
was much improved. Having got one of
Warner’s Safe Cure pamphlets, I studied it
with the result that I tried the medicine, and
can say with every satisfaction. Before I
finished the first bottle I felt I was improving
and have taken in all fourteen. I no longer
suffer pain, languor, or other unpleasant feel-
ings which is entirely due to the Safe
Cure and Safe Pills. My friends say lam
quite another man, and I feel such to be
the case, solely from the use of Warner’s
Safe Cure and Safe Pills.”

N.S.W., 23rd March, 16185.—“F0r the last
twelve years I have been suffering from pains
in my back, spine and scrotum, down the inside
of my thighs, feeling so languid, and weak as
not to be able to work. I could not turn
over in bed, neither could I lay an hour w i t h o u t
vomiting, which gave me great pain, and
sometimes would pass a quantity of Gravel.
Since taking Warner’s Safe Cure, my pains
have nearly all left me. I can rest well
nights, and feel in good spirits. My urine
is natural, in fact I consider myself on the
road to complete recovery.
■Warner’s Safe Cure for Typhoid Fever.
48 Mount Street,Pybmont, Sydney, N.S.W.
22nd March, 1886.—“ Having suffered from
Typhoid Fever for seven months, during
which time I had four relapses, it is need-
less to say how prostrated I was. I cannot
let the opportunity pass without letting you
know what a boon Warner’s Safe Cure was
to me, being safe, speedy, and certain. lam
now quite well, and enjoy a cricket match as
much as before my illness.
BEWARE I
Unprincipalled persons Jealous of the suc-
cess of WARNER'S SAFE CURE, and utterly
unscrupulous as to the means employed to
compass their selfish ends, advertise in the
public prints that their nostrums will cure
Kidney and Liver Diseases. Such a result
ivas never heard or thought of until it iras
believed money might be obtained by trading
on the fair name and fame of WARNER’S
SAFE CURE, Any person of intelligence
knows that Vile Whisky Bitters will not, never
has, nor ever can cure diseased Kidneys or
Liver. The raw liquor in these cheap de-
coctions acts as fire on the delicate tissues
of the inflamed and congested organs, and
makes their victim infinitely worse. Yet what
do these human vultures care? Nothing!
It is “your money and your life" with them.
There is but one known specific for Kidney,
Liver, and Urinary diseases, and that is
WARNER'S SAFE CURE. It has been sub-
jected to the most severe tests in three
continents, and incontestibly proved to be all
it is represented by hundreds of thousands
of grateful men and women, As you value
your health, shun all vile worthless Whisky
Bitters as you would so much poison.

WATCH
TJIE KIDNEYg.
They are the most important secretory organs.
Into and through the Kidneys flow the waste fluids of
the body, containing poisonous matter taken out of
the system. If the Kidneys do not act properly this
matter is retained, the whole system becomes dis-
ordered, and the following symptoms will follow :
Headache, Weakness, Pain in the Small of back and
loins, flushes of heat, chills, with disordered stomach
and bowels. You can thoroughly protect the Kidneys
by Dr. Bell’s Bitters, and when any of these symptoms
manifest themselves you can quickly rid yourself of
them by this best of all medicines for the Kidneys—
Dr. Bell’s Bitters.
What is Dyspepsia?
Among the many symptoms of Dyspepsia or Indi-
gestion the most prominent are —Variable appetite ;
faint, gnawing feeling at pit of the stomach, with un-
satisfied craving for food ; heartburn, feeling of
weight and wind in the stomach, bad breath, bad
taste in the mouth, low spirits, general prostration,
headache, and constipation. There is no form of
disease more prevalent than dyspepsia, and none so
peculiar to the high-living and rapid-eating Australian
people. Alcohol and tobacco produce Dyspepsia;
also bad air, rapid eating, &c. Dr. Bell’s Bitters will
cure the worst case by regulating the bowels and
toning up the digestive organs. Sold everywhere.
Note.—Any poor Person, or the manager of any
Hospital, Asylum, or Old People’s Home, may obtain
the Bitters gratuitously, upon written application to
the Agents, accompanied by a certificate of a Minister
of the Gospel, certifying that they are unable to pay
for medicine.

BEWARE ;
Unprinoipalled persons, jealous of the success of
Warner’s safe cure, and utterly unscrupulous as
to the means employed to compass their selfish
ends, advertise in the public prints that their
nostrums will cure Kidney and Liver Diseases.
Such a result was never heard or thought of until
it was believed money might be obtained by trad-
ing on tne fair name and fame of Warner’s safe
cure. Any person of intelligence knows that Vile
Whisky Bitters will not, never has, nor ever can
cure diseased Kidneys or Liver. The raw liquor
in these cheap decoctions acts as fire on the delicate
tissue of the inflamed and congested organs, and
makes their victim infinitely worse. Yet what do
these human vultures care ? Nothingl It is ‘your
money and your life” with them. There is but
one known specific for Kidney, L'ver, and Urinary
diseases and that is Warner’s safe cure. It has
been subjected to the most severe testa in three
continents, and incontestibly proved to be ail it is
represented by hundreds of thousands of grateful
men and women. As you value your health, shun
ail vile worthless Whisky Bitters as you would so
much poison.
Ned. Trickett Interviewed.
A Rockhampton correspondent sends us the fol
lowing: A few days ago I attempted to interview
the remains of Ned Trickett, formerly the water
deity of Australia in general, and of New South
Wales in particular. Ned now keeps the Oxford
Arms, in East-street, where he leads a peacefu
existence among the dlsembottled spirits of the
past; and thither I went to beard the alligator in
his den (it would spoil the metaphor to call him a
lion, as that animal is not partial to water). Ntd
has the reputation of being exceedingly unap-
proachable, and pressmen are his special detesta-
tion, so I did not anticipate much success, and I
got even lees than I looked for. Blessed are they
who expect nothing for they shall not be disap-
pointed. I found the ex-champion, as usual, in
his bar, where he lounges away the entire day,
making on an average about three remarks p?r
week; and I opened our acquaintance with a brief
allusion to drinks. Ned’s response to my invita-
tion was monosyllabic, and consisted of the single
observation, “ H'm.” He did not chance to have
his mouth open at the moment, having, ap-
parently, closed it for the week (this was
on a Thursday morning), and nothing short
of a great emergency seemed likely to
rouse him up. I ob-
served, too, tbat he con-
fined himself to sherry,
and seemed exceedingly
chary of sampling his own
blue-iuin. Evidently It
was useless to wait until
he turned the tap and let
his eloquence flow of his
own accord, so I opened
my business by asking
him lor a few details of
his own recent career,
and as the immediate re-
sult of my rashness our
new-born friendship, ce-
mented by sherry and
shsndy-gafl, was shat-
tered in an instant—
Like a clam on ’he sea
shore when high is the
tide
My host was prepared to
absorb and Imbibe;
Like a clam when the tide
is distressingly low,
He shut up bis sheli and
gave way to his wo-.
Ned’s woo was iu regard
to things in general and
newspapers in particular,
and his deep rooted ani-
mosity was of a kind that,
if It only had scope for
action, would leave noth-
ing larger than a 3-m
quad to represent the
whole journalistic world
of Australia. He was not
loud or voluble, it is true,
but he was viciously
vindictive, and uttered
strange Internal sounds
as if his gastric juices
held oaths in solution and
they were crystallizing
into oxide of blasphemy.
If he could have backed
up against an editor and
kicked out with both
leet he would have done
it with sincere pleasure.
His grievance was based,
so lar 1 could learn, on
tbe occasional comments
which have appeared
since his eclipse, and Ned
is half inclined to give up
the hotel business and
spend his old r ge in pro
scenting actions lor libel
against those journals
which mention that he is
no longer champion. I
finished my long shandy,
therefore, and came
awaj, leaving him ttlll
making observations In
submarine language. 1
have been ill ever since
that interview, but I may
mention that 1 do not
ascribe my sufferings to
Ned s beer, having drunk
much woise compounds,
especially on one occa-
sion when snowed up in
a central Otapo town-
ship and reduced to kero-
sene, afier having drunk
the bar dry. The local
census-taker to whom I
next applied could only
inform me tbat Ned was
an able- bodied male whit?
citizen, aged 35 years,
which facts I already knew. From information
gathered elsewhere, however, it is evident the
ex-champion’s career is quite finished. He has run
an hotel over since his arrival at Rockhampton, and
at one time made an occasional appearance on the
river, but has long since washed off his war-paint
His last challenge, and probably the last he will
ever Issue, was directed to some of the local oars-
men, Ned offering to pull a four-eared crew on
the Fitzroy, but the event did not come off, and
the once great sculler now never enters a boat.
He has apparently abjured spirits as well as blue
water, aud like Mr, Venus, he floats his powerful
mind in tea, and runs his little bosto ry in peace,
except when disturbed by his old enemy, the
Press. He has seemingly become a fixture in this
town, and Rockhampton is certainly a good place
for a man to grow old in if he wants to do it in a
hurry. It is also eminently suited for a man who
wishes to die, or to go mad, or to write poetry, or
to repent of his pass sine; but at the same time I
would be glad to see Ned Trickett in some more
congenial location, where he would find a little
amusement to fill in time till Gabriel comes along
aad blows his clarionet.
The Fxritrss, the organ of the R. C. heir-
aroby iu.N.S.W., says a dally newspaper in the
Irish R.C interests is contemplated in Sydney.
“It,” says The Express, “white run on commercial
does, but will always be prepared to defend our
boiyredgion a-, d rbe cause of fatherland whenever
necessary ; aid, instead of allowing the garbled
Irish l?) news ius< rted in our dallies to pass as the
true state of matters in the old land, a full supply
of reliable information will appear from day to
day Already ar’a igements are being made for
its early production.”
They know how to make the glory of God
pay in the fflce of the Australasian. Here’s a
little remark from a late issue:—“ All desirous of
aiding in the good work of continuing the publi-
cation of sermons are earnestly requested to for-
ward subs riptions.” This is fair average right-
eousness as the thing passes amongst us no r-aday s.
The Australasian won’t scatter the seed of
saving grace gratis— no, not when there are horse-
races divorce-suits to All its scintillant
columns; but when the offerings of the good souls,
des rous of shouldering the gospel-chariot along,
mount high enough, the pious editor gives his
readers half-an-hour of hysteria, from the fiery
Spurgeon mostly, and the recording angel puts it
down to him.

Why they were butchered is a matter of no con-
sideration whatever. In all probability not one

“murder” so bravely avenged, but it seemed de-
sirable to butcher someone, and accordingly these
defenceless wretches were shot down just to “ en-

A Sydney suburban alderman has just
pronounced that ail this doctors’ scare about the
danger arising from the “floovia” of bad drains
is “mere bosh.” Ho aas lived near one for the
past four years, and ho never had to call a doctor
into his house except on those joyous occasions
when his good lady thought proper to show cause
why assisted emigration should be abolished. This
aldormanio Solomon must be a near roiation to the
man who declared that he was cured of bronchitis
by sleeping in a damp bed in a room with a leaky
roof and two broken window panes; and got rid
of dyspepsia by adopting a liberal diet of curried
lobster, pork chops, crumpets dumplings, and
colonial beer. Verily, we live and learn—at least,
s ;me of us do, and the rest of ui bluff the lunatic
asylum authorities by becoming aldermen. Syd-
neyites are used to the “ civic ” argument. “What
do you want baths for ?” asked the old-time
alderman—“look at mo, and I haven’t had a bath
for 20 years I”
The Scottish Nbws, looking at the failure
of the Commercial Bank of 8.A., says that “the
whole of the colonies are rapidly nearing the mar-
gin of very troubled waters.” We presume that
the News has heard of the Commercial’s manager,
the Rev. Crooks, and his excessive piety, so
strangely like that of its own City of Glasgow
Bank directors. By the way, Australia, which
will in another generation be able to buy up Scot-
land, wonders when there will be an inroad into
the Land o’ Cakes of wealth producers. Three-
fourths of Scotland is now owned by a handful of
useless drones. The total acreage of Scotland is
18.946 694 One single nobleman owns 1,336,000
acres, and his wife 149,879. Another has 431,000
acres, a third 434,000, a fourth 378,000 Twelve pro-
prietors own one quarter of the whole acreage of
the country, 70 proprietors own one half. Nine-
tenths of Scotland belong to 1700 persons. Whilst
on the one hand there are these mammoth pro-
prietors, on the other we are told of crofters who
are starving, and who are evicted from their poor
holdings beemse they cannot live and pay the
rent which is exacted from them. The Scottish
Nkws, before extracting the mote from the Aus-
tralian eye. had batter pull the beam out of its
own single optic and start a timber-yard.
ev. J efforts warns people against cynic-
ism, and s iy<: —“ Young men had to come to him
with the gloomiest accounts religiously of some
of the great shops and warehouses in Sydney.
They say the Christian y mng men could be
counted by twos and threes es against soorei and
hundreds of others absolutely irreligious.” So
long as the meek and godly youths don’t increase
iu numbers, especially ui the banks, things will
perhaps continue to worry along much as they are
now. When tae number of saints in positions of
trust Increases we shall have to pay too much for
the gaol vote. But perhaps we do the young men
an injustice. You see wo have just been reading
about Crooks, the pious thief, of Adelaide, also
about Walker, the defaulting secretary of the
Adelaide Young Men’s Christian Association. At
Hobart, in January, this exemplary young Walker
was loud in hla denunciations against card and
billiard-playing; and at the same meeting he read
a paper, in which he said that the association
ought to guard young men from evil and vice.
Saint Walker, who, after all, seems to possess a
humorous turn, also urged the local society to
follow the example of the Adelaide Association in
the way it conducted Its business. Ah, yes, we
see Dr. Jefferls is right. Walker was a cynic as
well as a saint. Cynicism ruined him.
The Kapunda Herald, one of the ablest
exponents of the land-nationalisation theory in
Australia, thus puts the advantages of leasing as
against absolute sale of land:—‘‘The selector
should remember that every shilling he pays In
rent is made by the whole community and goes
into the national exchequer to reduce, and even-
tually abolish, indirect taxation. The true rent of
land—that is, the annual value given to the land
by the general progress, leaving everything else to
the tenant, is what the State will reserve to Itself;
while under the system of private landlordism,
which is creeping on us here and which is the c urse
of older countries, the true rent and whatever in
addition can be screwed out of the helplessness of
the tenant, will be paid to a class of sinecurists
who can live in idleness and luxury while the
drudges of the country have to bear the brunt of
taxation.”
The following gives
an Interesting- glimpse of
what some people think
of their own responsi-
bility in tendering evi-
dence When Rusden, the
New Z aland 5000 pound-
er historian, was in the
box the counsel examin-
ing said, “Would you be
willing jour book should
go forth to the world
again as it now stands ?”
‘ No.” “You admit it
contains gross. - libels
aoout Mr. Bryce?” j“ I
admit there are certain
inaccuracies which would
have to be altered.”
" Wh u did you discover
j our riatement* were un-
true?' •• Some lime ago.”
“Yrt you come into
couit pleading justifica-
tion, and swearing that
the libels were true in
substance and in fact?”
“ I acted under legal ad-
vice”: that is to say, he
had sworn to certain
statements not according
to his own belief, but ac-
cording to what h 1 s
law ye; s told him. Js there
theu no ch ck on the
gentlemanly Christian
lawyers who persuade
people to commit per-
jury?
A Sydney gentleman
lets us make an extract
from a etter received by
him from a friend at
Collengu 1 e, a small place
south cf Wagga, which
will enable the public to
perceive at once that the
squatter is getting too
wealthy and should be
kicked out of this
country forthwith :
“The country about is in
a really terrible state.
Men who have say 50,000
sheep are watching them
die in hundreds. Fifteen
hundred sheep sold near
Tirana, a few days ago,
brought 2s. 101. a head.
To make matters worse,
this is lambing-time, and
as soon as the lamb starts
to suck the ewe, the pair
are nearly sure to die. It
is horrible to see a ewe
lambing with about 20
crows watching her.
After waiting round a
while the crows aforesaid
hop down and calmly
pick its eyes out and then
devour as much more of
it as they want. If a sheep
goes to the river, and
while getting a drink gets
bogged in the mud, in one
hour its eyes will be
‘removed’ by crows. I
could walk along the
Murrumbidgee for one
mile and see 100 dead
sheep.”
