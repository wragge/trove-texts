■COR centuries Canterbury has been
the see of the primate of all England,
metropolitan, and its cathedral is one of
the greatest architectural and historical
treasures in Britain. Its history began
over 1300 years ago in the Romanised
English town of Durovernum, which was
a commercial post situated at the con-
vergence of military roads from Dover,
Lympne and Richborough. After the
Romans departed it became the capital
of the Saxon king Ethelbert, who in the
year 597 welcomed St. Augustine and his
forty monks and gave them land on
which to build a monastery and church.
The church which St. Augustine dedi-
cated was sacked and burned by the
Danes in 1011, and was later restored by
Canute, the Danish king, whose church
was also destroyed by fire. The oldest
stones of the Cathedral’s fabric belong
to the church rebuilt by the Norman
Archbishop Lanfranc. These stones were
brought across the English Channel from
Caen, in Normandy.
Throughout succeeding reigns and
under successive archbishops, Canterbury
Cathedral gained in importance as it
acquired age, beauty and dignity, and
today it is one of the supreme expres-
sions of the enduring faith of man.
In 1170 it was the scene of the murder
of Archbishop Thomas Becket by four
knights who came from the court of
Henry 11, which was then near Bayeux,
in Normandy; following this dark deed
Henry II suffered his penitential scourg-
ing in the crypt of the Cathedral. Here
are the Royal tombs of King Henry IV,
Queen Joan of Navarre and of Edward,
the Black Prince. It was he who visited
Canterbury Cathedral with the captive
king of France after the battle of
Poitiers in 1357, when a French army of
60,000 was defeated by an English army
8000 strong.
Canterbury was the target for several
enemy air raids during the Second World
War, the greatest of which was the
“Baedeker” reprisal raid during the night
of May 31, 1942. The noble Cathedral
suffered superficial damage from “near
misses,” but its library was destroyed.

ART OF THE THEATRE.
The important thing about the famous
Stanislavsky system of acting is that it was
not a system at all. True, if you wanted
to relax your muscles and prepare your-
self for concentration on the problems of
your role, you could stare at the top of
your thumb ; or, if you were on stage and
wanted to put yourself in a proper state
for emitting magnetic radiations you
could select a small area of the actor
opposite you and stare at it until gradually
you enlarged the circle of your awareness
—which must have been slightly em-
barrassing for the area subjected to this
scrutiny—rbut, as David Magarshack em-
phasises in Stanislavsky on the Art of the
Stage (Faber), these devices were only
means to an end, and it was the end that
was all-important to the great producer.
The difference between Stanislavsky
and those teachers who merely impart the
mechanics of voice, gesture and per-
ambulation and the time-worn tricks for
capturing the audience’s attention is that
the Russian —who died in 1938 and who
directed the Moscow Art Theatre in a
period when it was still possible for him
to declare his complete opposition to pro-
paganda-plays—regarded the actor as a
creative artist. Certainly, under his rule,
the actor had to know his tricks ; but it
was more important that he should be
able to reproduce in his mind the inner
life of the character he was portraying,
and then the tricks would not be mere
trickery but the natural outward revela-
tion of that character in speech and
action.
Stanislavsky maintained that there
were, broadly speaking, three types of
actor; the creative, the imitative, and the
stage-hack. All three kinds can give you,
up to a point, an entertaining or even a
brilliant performance, for in all of them
may lie a measure of art, and even the
hack performance may have the outward
appearance of art. The hack, “unable to
enter into the feeling of his part,” merely
“reproduces the text of his part by means
of once-and-for-all worked-out methods
of acting a clever selection of
different theatrical cliches and their
combination.” This is, perhaps, to take
an Australian example, the sort of acting
one gets in radio serials where the actor
hasn’t time to study his part (which, in
any case, may not be worth seriously
studying): so, from the combined skill of
the actor and the producer, you get the
appearance of art, something which will
.serve for the moment. It may be reason-
ably effective entertainment; but it is
hardly “the life of the human spirit,”
which is what Stanislavsky looked for in
the theatre.
David Magarshack’s account of
Stanislavsky’s analysis of the “imitative”
land of acting—neither as meretricious as
the hack nor as deeply sincere as the
creative—expresses what the present re-
viewer felt about Olivier’s “School for
Scandal,” though not his “Richard the
Third.” Whereas Quayle and Diana
Wynyard in “Much Ado About Nothing”
seemed wholly to believe in what they
were doing, so that the theatre
bubbled with joy in a way one rarely sees
in period comedy, whether Shakspeare’s
or Sheridan’s, Olivier in the Sheridan
play seemed fundamentally cold, present-
ing only the appearance of mirth:
The difference between the creative and
the imitative actor is that the latter enters
into the feelings of his part only during
the preparatory stages of his work, while
during the actual performance he does so
only indirectly, that is to say, by imitating
his former experience. Such acting, as
Stanislavsky points out, may be beautiful,
but it is not deep;, it is effective rather
than powerful. It creates a greater impres-
sion on the spectator’s sight and hearing
than on his spirit, and for that reason it
thrills rather than moves him. The spec-
tator, in short, admires rather than believes
in such imitative acting. Its means are too
superficial or too showy for the expression
of great passions, for the subtleties and
depths of human feeling defy all technical
methods. They need the direct assistance
of nature herself at the moment the actor
enters into the feelings of his part and gives
them an outward embodiment. But for all
that the representation of a part which is
only prompted by the process of genuine
feeling must be recognised as an art.
There is a school of thought which
holds directly opposite views from
Stanislavsky. It supports the imitative
rather than the creative actor. Where
Stanislavsky holds that the actor must at
all times, even if it is his thousandth per-
formance in a certain role, believe
absolutely in what he is doing—in the
reality of the part he is playing and the
“given situation” in which he finds him-
self ; thinking only of the work in hand
and not so much thinking of it as being
the character—the other school believes
that the actor, while mechanically per-
forming the actions and saying the
speeches required of him, can safely at
the same time be thinking how much he
would like a cup of tea or whether or not
he will back Dogsbody in the Cup.
Neither of these methods can, in the
nature of things, be absolute. The
creative actor, no matter how much he
may believe he is Macbeth, will some-
times remember that he is really Mr.
Jones, who has pretty girls and unpaid
bills to think of. The mechanical actor
will sometimes be carried away by the ex-
citement of the moment on stage and live
his role as well as merely playing it. But
one can hardly doubt that, fundamentally,
Stanislavsky’s approach is infinitely to be
preferred.
The best test for it, as Stanislavsky
himself said, is in performance; try it out
(as Doha Ribush used to try it out in Mel-
bourne) and see if the result is not more
satisfying. But a theoretical test is also
possible, for if a stage performance is to
be a work of creative art and the actor a
creative artist, we should be able to find
in Stanislavsky’s theories the principles
which animate and govern all the arts.
And those are exactly what we do find.
An actor, said Stanislavsky, should not
play to the audience but should immerse
himself in the situation of the play ; if he
was deeply interested in what he was
doing the audience would also become
interested. Sets should be designed not
to dazzle the spectator but to help the
actor believe in the reality of his part, and
as long as the set did this it did not matter
whether it was realistic or symbolic. The
actor should be “completely” carried
away by the? play, for only then could he
perform his part “without being aware of
his own feelings and without thinking of
what he is doing, everything happening by
itself, subconsciously.” An actor should
not be satisfied with an interpretation
that was more-or-less satisfying “in
general,” only with an interpretation that
absolutely represented the whole inward
and outward individuality of the
character. A play should be approached
as a series of “pieces,” separate scenes,
separate scenes within scenes, and the
actor must interest himself in the
mastery of each of these “pieces” in turn.
If a “piece” happened to be perfectly per-
formed one night it was no use the actor
trying to “fix” it, memorising intonation
and gesture so that he could repeat the
effect the next night; it was more im-
portant to try to recapture the creative
state of mind out of which the perfect per-
formance had flowered. The “pieces,”
finally, must blend into “one line,” the
fundamental meaning and direction of the
play.
David Magarshack is fully aware of the
dangers in Stanislavsky’s method: an
actor or producer who misreads the play-
wright has only to take the wrong “line,”
as Stanislavsky himself did in his early
days by turning “The Cherry Orchard,”
which Chekhov thought of as a light
comedy, into a tragedy, to cause the
greatest grief to the author. But there
are dangers in any system of acting, and
it is hard to disagree with a view so noble
in intention as Stanislavsky’s, in which the
actor’s profession is so much dignified
and in which one sees a performance on
the stage growing and flowering before
one’s eyes like a work of art —never to
be “fixed,” never precisely to be repeated,
never intended merely to astonish the
audience or to bring applause for the
actor, never merely pleasing “in general,”
never mechanical but flowing from the
subconscious mind of the actor, who must
so have studied the play and (Stanislavsky
insists) so fully and richly lived, observing
himself and other men, that he is able to
become the character he is acting. If it
is a counsel of perfection which says that
an actor must live his part before and
after he performs it on the stage and that
the principal actor —to get himself into
the creative state of mind—must come
to the theatre, every night, at least two
hours before the play begins, what other
counsel is worth while? And besides, as
David Magarshack points out, what
Stanislavsky advocated is essentially no
more than Mrs. Siddons practised.
Stanislavsky on the Art of the Stage
consists of a long foreword by David
Magarshack, a series of discourses
Stanislavsky gave to the Moscow Bolshoy
Theatre in 1918 when it was decided to
improve the acting of the opera company,
and a record of five rehearsals of
“Werther,” based on shorthand-notes
taken by one of the actors. It does not
add a great deal to the Stanislavsky books
previously published and, within its own
confines, it is to some extent repetitive.
But for anyone wanting an introduction
to Stanislavsky and a summary of his
ideas, or anyone looking for a critical
basis on which to approach the art of the
stage, it is fascinating.
Diplomaf-Parson-Squire.
Adding a long introduction, some inter-
mediate chapters, and notes, to an old
autobiography, . Dr. Esme Wingfield-
Stratford has put out, in This Was a Man
(Robert Hale), a life of the Honorable
Edward Vesey Bligh, 1829-1908.
Bligh was the younger son of the fifth
Earl of Darnley ; he began a career as
diplomat in Hanover, Florence and
Berlin, and seems to have attracted
Palmerston’s eye over a few bits of deft
handling; but then he began wooing the
Earl of Abergavenny’s daughter, Isabel.
The Earl approved, but on condition that
Bligh forsook diplomacy and took
religious orders. So the young man be-
came a clergyman, and the enormously
wealthy and powerful old Earl preferred
him to ecclesiastical livings that were
within his gift.
In 1875, after the death of the Earl
and Countess of Abergavenny, Bligh re-
signed the incumbency of Birling and be-
came the squire of Fatherwell Hall, Thus
he was in the course of his life diplomat,
parson and squire ; and if he did littlf
that is remembered, his story makes an
interesting document of the times: his
diplomatic days supply a note on King’s
Messengers of the 1850’s:
These Messengers- had an undress sort
of uniform, but I never saw but two,
Johnstone and Poignard, who availed them-
selves of it, and they travelled always at
their own risk in mufti. I don’t think their
position was altogether a satisfactory one
socially: for they succeeded to a different
and lower class —the Courier class of
former times —and although some of the
Ambassadors and Ministers and nearly all
the Attaches were civil to them, I don’t
think they were fully recognised as members
of the diplomatic circle , . .
Lord Darnley, of Cobham Park, had
little affection for Lord Abergavenny, his
near-neighbor, and vice versa:
Lord Darnley had an almost old-maidish
possessiveness about Cobham Park and
it was known that the hunt was emphati-
cally expected to mind its P’s and Q’s
within these sacred precincts, of which the
holy of holies was constituted by the avenue
that went from the house to the village,
and was exclusively reserved for the funeral
of the head of the family, the gate never
being opened except for that purpose. Now
it happened that a hunted fox ran under
this same gate, with the hounds hot on its
trail. There was a momentary check....
but a famous sporting character, a Kentish
yeoman farmer called Dick Russell
vaulted olf his horse, and lifted the gate
bodily off its hinges, letting through the
whole field, who followed the hounds at
break-neck gallop down the avenue. At
the end of it they encountered Lord Darn-
ley, whom the noise had brought out of
the house, literally and fortunately speech-
less. Next day it was intimated that Lord
Darnley had withdrawn his subscription
from the hunt. The day after it was an-
nounced that Lord Abergavenny had
tripled his....
Bligh’s days as a practising clergyman
were considerably taken up with burglars
and drunken servants *, and at St.
Leonard’s-on-Sea he had to deal diplo-
matically with a clergyman who proved
to have been a convict transported for
forgery ; but it was as Vicar of Birling
that he was most active, conducting a
campaign against landlords whose houses
were badly roofed and insanitary, and
later, joining forces with an evangelist
family called Jary, beginning “The Great
Birling Revival,” a somewhat scandalous
novelty in the 1870’s, not approved of by
the Earl of Abergavenny and his
Countess, who are by Dr. Wingfield-
Stratford thought to have had some hand
in a threatened strike of servants at the
Vicarage.
In his later years as squire, Bligh be-
came a magistrate, a popular and paternal
one, and led a movement to get better
roads. He had always been a cricketer,
and proposed as early as 1898 the leg-
before-wicket rule which was not adopted
until many years after. In his old age he
was to be seen pedalling a tricycle, with
which he had several accidents ; and from
the last of these he died.
Epic Makers.
If one is not carried away by Maxwell
Dunn’s excitement in his book How They
Made “Sons Of Matthew ” (Angus and
Robertson), it is probably because the
backslapping jargon of the stage, film and
radio worlds induces vertigo in the re-
viewer no less than the heights of the
Macpherson Ranges in which most of
Mr. Dunn’s marvels came to pass.

Tli Conquest of Happiness.
Catherine Gaskin’s newest story, Dust
In the Sunlight (Collins), is of Ruth, a
London music student who marries’ a
charming cad called Alex Channing
while hey are both on leave from World
War 1; he dies shortly after the war, by
accident. Life is like that.
Ei 'body is sorry for Ruth, whore-
fuse- to live in a flat with Channing’s
grandmother, whose evil influence has
perv: ted the lives of the whole Channing
family. Ruth goes to Ireland to stay with
Ginny Kilgannon, who is dying of tuber-
culosis and whose husband gets himself
shot in full view of her window for mur-
dering a policeman as member of the
I.R.A. Seeing her husband shot hastens
Ginny Kilgannon’s end. Ruth takes
G ; iiny’s little baby boy to England, and
goes to live in the old mansion on the
farm which she has inherited from her
husband, Alex Channing.
Ruth is still very unhappy, but Mark
Hudson, son of a neighboring squire, is
very unhappy, too, because he is in love
war. beautiful Mrs. Claire Brockley of
the same district, Claire Brockley, who
first introduced Ruth to Alex Channing,
is also unhappy, because she has been
Alex Channing’s mistress, and not only
is lie dead, but her husband, John
Brockley, raids her safe-deposit box and
uncovers the scandal, denouncing her at
an ternoon-tea party. For he is ex-
tremely unhappy, too. . .
By this time Ruth is in love with Marx
Hudson, and when Mark Hudson sees
how Claire Brockley has been carrying
on he offers marriage to Ruth, who ac-
cepts him. But one day in church Ku
seems him looking at Claire Brockl - y,

A LADY By CHOICE
By DAVID ROWBOTHAM
IN one of those shabby off-
streets near the beach where,
at two o’clock in the morn-
ing, nothing seems to survive
except a few empty cars, derelict
in shadow, leaning into the
narrow kerbs, over which the
dull dreams of yellow lights fall
from storied rooms; where
silence is the one circumstance
paramount to neglect, and above
all washes the sound of the surf
and the fusing gleams of cosmo-
politan stars: there lives Erica,
in a two-roomed flat with a
radiogram.
Alongside the radiogram is her
bed, rarely made up, since it is
constantly either ignored or slept
in, for Erica arises at eight to
begin work at nine, and, being
cook, maid and housekeeper to
herself, allows herself little
time —after she has played, in
addition, cosmetician, hair-
dresser and milliner to herself
for the making of one silly old
bed which would be uncomfort-
able no matter how well the
mattress was thumped and
turned and the sheets swept
smooth. Then, although her
office day ends at five, she starts |
work at the cafe a few minutes '
afterwards, arriving breathless
but pretty to peddle dishes and
coquette with or discourage, as
she pleases, the customers there
until seven, when, unescorted
but leaving behind her, perhaps,
an invitation to “call at eight,
she departs for home.
Between seven and eight she
has, posh’vely no time to make
the bed, although she might
parenthetically “whip up” the
bedclothes to the crumbled pil-
low and leave it at that.
THE kitchen is scenic with
clotheslines bearing with
some discretion, and some indis-
cretion, undies and what-have-
you seemingly too delicate to
permit description. They would
be likely to fall apart. And
there’s a sofa in the corner by
the disused shute that leads to
the laundry downstairs and up
which, one memorable night, a
desperate suitor thrust himself,
a bunch of roses and a bottle of
Burgundy. He and the roses
were rejected, but the Burgundy
was retained with thanks singu-
lar for being so promiseless.
On top of the dresser, among
bric-k-brac, dust and unidentifi-
able paraphernalia, rests a
safety-razor with blade inserted
and touches of rust and dried
foam and flecks of facial hair
about its edges. The gas-stove is
disreputable, but, next to the bed,
the most exploited appurtenance
of the flat. There are one tea-
spoon, three cups and saucers
which don’t match and an old
stone teapot, all “got” from the
caf£ where she works, and two
hard chairs, one green, one
varnished, standing by the
linoleum-covered table under the
sliding windows which, because
they won’t slide, are never
opened. The sink catches ade-
quately the drops from the tap
and is a favorite repository for
the dishcloth, odd cutlery, tea-
leaves and, frequently, “empties.”
The most distinctive piece of
furniture in the bedroom adjoin-
ing is the radiogram. The bath-
room, in the hallway, is com-
munal.
WHEN her gentleman-friend
sees her home at midnight,
or later—much later, maybe—he
is led delightfully by the hand
into the black lobby yawning
welcome behind the door that
has a latch and a scratchy bell,
up narrow stairs that bend
abruptly halfway and relinquish
their rail at the landing, on a
little further, ascending close to
the wall and so into the passage-
way, at the end of which is the
door that opens to stuffiness,
signs of desultory but neverthe-
less discriminatory living, tea or
coffee and the radiogram.
Erica is motherless. She
grew up during the war. Before
the night is through she will tell
her gentleman-friend this much
at least, and if he appears sym-
pathetic as well as attentive, he
will learn that she ran away from
a father who daily drank and
beat his family of twelve and
established herself
with nine frocks, two
evening-dresses and
lots of hope for the
nominal charge of
one pound per week
in the two-roomed

"CANT, HUMBUG AND
HYPOCRISY."
In the long history of the Australian
“Labor” party there is no record of a
greater display of hypocrisy than that to
which the House of Representatives was
treated during debate on the Communist
Dissolution Bill, especially by Mr. Chifiey
and Dr, Evatt.
For over 30 years “Labor” has run,
though perhaps unwillingly, in double
harness with Communism. Communists,
including the head of the party and the
then official representative of the Comin-
tern, sat on the committee which in 1921
drafted the “Labor” objective of sociali-
sation, along with people like Messrs.
Curtin, Scullin and Holloway.
Attempts to expel Communists in the
early ’twenties only led to their taking
control of the N. S. Wales “Labor” party,
to which Messrs. Chifiey and Evatt
belonged, and tearing it to pieces. A
second attempt to oust them in 1928 was
foiled by a section led by the late
J. A. Beasley, Minister for Supply
and Shipping in the war-time “Labor”
Governments, which secured the passage
of a resolution through the N. S. Wales
A.L.P. Easter conference that “while the
policy and methods of the A.L.P. and
Communist party are at variance, the
objective of these parties is identical, i.e.,
the socialisation of industry,” and that,
therefore, “the ill-considered dictum of
the Federal officials would prohibit the
rank-and-file from advocating their own
policy.”
The end of the depression saw the
discovery that the many socialisation
units which had been formed in N. S.
Wales under the auspices of the N.S.W.
“Labor” party were “dominated by Com-
munist influence,” which was not surpris-
ing, since the socialisation committee of
the A.L.P. included a couple of Moscow
delegates and made use of such sterling
“Labor” men for lecturers as Mr. Shar-
key, then recently returned from the
latest Comintern conferences.
A year or two later the annual report
of the A.L.P. executive stated, referring
to a supposedly bogus rival Labor execu-
tive which had risen up:
On this provisional executive we find
H. L. Denford (i.e., former general sec-
retary and treasurer of the Communist
party) sitting side by side with the former
general (political) secretary, J. S. Garden,
Dr. Lloyd Ross, advocate of Communist
policy, and W. Macnamara, who, mem-
bers will remember, tried to establish a
dictatorship of the movement through the
medium of the socialisation units.
The secretary of the United Front Con-
ference was Mr. R. A. King, who was
selected immediately afterwards as delegate
to attend the celebrations in Moscow in
connection with the anniversary of the
Russian revolution.
In 1940 this Red faction was in com-
plete control of the N. S. Wales branch
of the “Labor” party, and there does not
seem to have been a single protest from
Mr. Chifiey or Dr. Evatt.
Mr, Beasley said, as reported in Han-
sard on May 2, 1940, that “circumstances
have arisen in N. S. Wales today which
definitely establish that the Communist
party is controlling the policy and
domestic affairs of the Labor party.”
The process of usurping that control,
he -said, had been “spread over a long
period of years, but developments had
all been in accordance with a well-defined
plan.”
When the Communist party was
banned that year, indeed, Dr. Lloyd Ross
slipped ostentatiously off the central com-
mittee of the Communist party, rejoined
the “Labor” party, and within a few
months was the chief propagandist of the
“Labor” Government in the propagation
of socialisation plans and paid as an
official of the Post-war Reconstruction
Department.
The year 1941 found Dr. Evatt ranged
with Communists in their fight for
the release of two Comrades who
had been placed in internment because
of subversive activities which they
had hoped would lead to revolution,
the Communist party at that time being
illegal. It also saw the institution ot
the campaign by the banned Communist
party for the internment of its opponents,
the Australia First men, who went in
holus bolus, despite their complete inno-
cence of the charges against them ; Dr.
Evatt and his associates in their case
having lost enthusiasm for the cause ot
freedom, their horror of the internment
regulations and, in fact, of everything to
which they had objected when the Com-
munists Ratliff and Thomas were
involved and tQ, which they are now so
vehemently objecting in the Communist
Party Dissolution Bill.
During the succeeding period, with Dr.
Evatt in office as Minister for Security
and Attorney-General, all prosecutions
of Communists were dropped, and the
Communist party carried on its organisa-
tion openly and without disguise and
reached its greatest numerical strength
before it was re-legalised by Dr. Evatt,
under a bond the terms of which it began
at once to break flagrantly, without inter-
ference from the authorities.
It was only as far back as 1946 that
Mr. J. A. Ferguson, president of the
A.L.P. Easter conference in N. S. Wales
and himself an ex-Communist, thought
so well of the Communist party that
he invited it publicly to disband and
join the Labor party in a body. And
it is only a short time since Mr. Chifley,
who is now prepared to accept a ban
on Communism, said that it was merely
another political philosophy and that Mr.
Holloway, M.P., declared it to be Christ-
like in its teachings.
The political heads of the party,
Messrs. Chifley and Evatt, run true to
the form which they have shown over a
number of years. They, in this case, are
prepared to accept the people’s verdict
that the Communist party shall be
banned, but they take no responsibility
for co-operating in making the ban
effective. They don’t want the Menzies
ban to have any teeth in it.
Dr. Evatt, as always when the liberty
of radicals has been concerned during his
career, has developed an abhorrence of
the “avoidance of legal processes” —pro-
cesses which he himself evaded so
blatantly in the case of the Australia First
men —and an affection for the courts
which he has not shown in such matters
since he came out into the open to secure
the freeing of the Communists Ratliff
and Thomas in 1941.
On the records of these gentlemen,
their arguments and those of the party
behind them are what a valued fore-
runner in the “Labor” movement, the late
J. A. Fihelly, described as “cant, hum-
bug and hypocrisy.”
It will be time enough to treat their
regard for liberty of the subject seriously
when they show the sincerity of their
“hatred” of Communism by insisting that
the A.L.P. branch to which they make
their pledges as “Labor” candidates
follows the example of the New Zealand
Federation of Labor and expels Com-
munist-run unions with W.F.T.U. affilia-
tions, such as the Watersiders and the
Ironworkers, from which come a very
large proportion of the funds that keep
the Australian “Labor” party alive, not
to mention a very large slice of
“Labor’s” policy, including socialisation.
Can U.N.O. Survive?
Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of
the Disunited Nations, has gone to
Moscow with “the hope and strong in-
tention” of “seeing Stalin about a
new and great effort to end the cold war.”
The challenge to end it, he said, is one
that “cannot be postponed.”
His mission was self-appointed, and
he went first to London and then to Paris
to consult the British and French Foreign
Offices “on the Chinese question,” evi-
dently desiring to take to Moscow a gift
in the form of consent to admission
of Communist China, now engaged in
an aggressive war, to a permanent seat on
thfe Security Council. His inquiry on the
point seems to have received the answer
it deserved. Britain and France have not
yet handed over their diplomatic
authority to the interim executive of the
sort of show that U.N.O. has, in Mr.
Lie’s own view, become. Mr. Lie’s
statement after these consultations was:
Increased tension is making the U.N.
unworkable. It was created as an organisa-
tion for the entire world. Now it is pro-
posed to split the world permanently into
two camps. There is only one possible end
to that road —a third world war. The other
road is the U.N. This road leads away
from the third world war instead of towards
it.
At Geneva he officiated at a ceremonial
taking-over for U.N.O. of the old League
of Nations headquarters, and addressed
the World Health Organisation Assembly,
one of the many U.N. bodies which
Soviet Russia has boycotted. There Mr.
Lie descried another challenge “a
supreme challenge” the “poverty,
hunger and insecurity of 1600 millions
in the so-called under-developed areas of
Asia,” where Soviet Russia is now
aiding and abetting civil war and mass
banditry, accompanied by famine, all
natural developments of the cold war.
Mr. Lie did not make that point: in
fact he deliberately skipped it in pro-
ceeding to cite these conditions as
another argument for reuniting the
nations in one great big happy family,
old Uncle Vyshinsky and all.
Since Mr. Lie can hardly be function-
ing under any delusions about the facts
of the cold war in Europe, the hot war
in S.E. Asia or the identity of those
interested in maintaining both, his pil-
grimage to Moscow oughUto be assessed
against its proper background, the features
of which are:
Mr. Trygve Lie’s five-year term as
Secretary-General expires this year. Mr.
Lie was Moscow’s choice in 1945 for
president of U.N.O. The “two-camp”
conflict began as early as that. When that
proposal failed Mr. Lie was made Secretary-
General.
Stalin, like Hitler in his day, has recently
inaugurated a “peace offensive” in order
to try to bring about a disinclination as
well as an inability (through lack of arma-
ment) in Western peoples to stand up to
Soviet aggression, Stalin wants the Western
leaders to come to Moscow to ask for
terms of peace in the “cold war.” (This
was Hitler’s technique, too.) Britain and
U.S.A. are not falling for that, but
apparently Mr. Lie is more pliable.
It may serve Soviet propaganda that
Mr. Lie should humbly pursue such
inquiries at the seat of opposition to the
organisation which he serves, in which
case he can return to the West only under
suspicion. It may serve Mr. Lie, also, if
U.N.O. Assembly can be persuaded that a
retiring Secretary-General who can get the
ear of Moscow is the best possible choice
for the office at the end of his term.
Of course there may not be another
term. Mr. Lie himself has advanced one
cause for fear on that score in that the
cold war is making U.N.O. unworkable,
he says, even if a third world war does
not come to finish it off. But that is not
the only accident against which U.N.O.
would now find the insurance premium
rather high. The Atlantic Pact between
America and the Powers of the Western
Union in Europe was received last year
by Mr. Lie and by president Evatt of
Australia as a supplanter of U.N.O.
among the democratic nations, and there-
fore a calamity; and Mr. Lie has never
made it clear that he does not date the
“two-camps” development from that
event rather than from Russian obstruc-
tion of U.N.O. (and the Foreign
Ministers’ Council outside it) since the
earliest meetings of both these bodies.
The continued cold war has made
the Atlantic Pact just what Mr. Lie
feared, and at the very hour of Mr. Lie’s
departure from U.N.O. headquarters on
his Moscow mission—indeed, perhaps
this was his inspiration—two influential
American Republican leaders, Herbert
Hoover and John Foster Dulles, declared
that U.N.O. as planned was finished, and
that the whole conception of an inter-
national society for keeping the peace of
the world should be refashioned. The
notion is not new: Mr. Hoover
expressly brought out his proposals in
order to test public opinion. He said:
I suggest that the United Nations should
be reorganised without Communist nations
in it. If that' is impracticable, then a
definite new united front should be
organised of those peoples who disavow
Communism, who stand for morals and
religion, and who love freedom.
This should have shaken those American
isolationists who expressed anxiety over
the spirited statement of policy by Mr.
Secretary of State Acheson in reply to
Moscow’s “peace offensive.” Mr. Dulles
went further. He said that the charter
and the membership of U.N.O. were
obsolete in face of new international
forces and should be reviewed at a
general conference; but, over and above
that, “economic and military aid for
Europe should be transformed into a
clear-cut programme for restoring per-
manent health and vigor.” The announced
programme of Soviet Communism, he
said, is one of “encircling and isolating
the United States so that it can be
strangled into submission,” and
We can save freedom for ourselves only
as we engage in the greater effort of saving
human freedom everywhere.
That Europe is not the only danger-
spot is testified by daily events. Mos-
cow’s blunt rejection of the American
Note over the Russians’ shooting-down
of an unarmed American naval plane
over the Baltic was followed within the
same week by announcement from Wash-
ington that plans were being drafted for

The Communist seizure of Hainan
part of Moscow’s “cold war” in Asia S
put Malaya and Indo-China in the same
category, whatever distinctions pol-
ticians may discover between the British
and the French problems in those conn
tries. They are alike in the path of an
aggressor carrying on war, the same path
the Japanese followed in the same region
10 years ago. The three-Power talks
between Britain, France and U.S.A. in
London last week have clinched the
matter.
What Mr. Lie could tell Stalin is that
the hotting-up of the cold war is having
the very opposite effect to that which the
Soviet hag presumably been aiming at.
It is not frightening America out of
Europe: it is crystallising her recogni-
tion of duty to remain there. It is not
weakening the Western bloc but
strengthening it. It is not limiting the
scope of the Atlantic Pact: it is extend-
ing it to the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
When the other day President Truman
reached Galesburg, Illinois, on his tour
of 16 American States, he told the crowd
that welcomed him that the decisions
made by the United States in the months
immediately ahead would determine
whether or not there would be a third
world war. “There will be one,” he said,
“if the United States reneges on our
allies as Russia is reneging on her allies.”
This is the “cold war” which Mr.
Trygve Lie has gone to Moscow to stop.

“Abdul Assiz,” back from a trip:—
In view of the growing need to attract dollar-
importing tourists to Australia, it is both

PLAIN ENGLISH
"Get On with the Job!"
Polling in Victoria on Saturday
registered primarily the electors’ view on
the entirely futile quarrel there between
the Liberals and the Country party. In
the 1947 elections these parties stood in
alliance. Popular opinion obviously
looked to them, in the State as in the
Federal sphere, to join forces in defence
against the socialisation objective and the
class-war advanced by “Labor.” In Vic-
toria the support for this stand approved
the Hollway-McDonald campaign by
returning 28 Liberals and 20 C.P. mem-
bers in an Assembly of 65.
The dispute that arose between the
coalition parties 12 months after their
forming a joint Ministry disgusted many
people. They had been voted into power
to check the disorder of Communist-run
strikes; yet ostensibly they quarreled
over the administration of an anti-strike
measure aimed at preserving essential
services from sabotage. Actually the split
arose largely, if not chiefly, from personal
jealousies, especially the intrigues of
Albert Dunstan, who died during the
election campaign. The C.P. element
suffered severely in public support when
it actually took over the Opposition
benches. Premier Hollway went so far
as to open the Liberal ranks to C.P.
dissidents, and changed the name of his
party to Liberal-Country party to assist
their adherence.
Inevitably the parties elected to office
in 1947 lost ground on Saturday as the
result of their wrangling. Two rebel
Liberals appear to have been defeated.
The L.C.P. ranks are expected to num-
ber 28 in the new Parliament in place of
the 30 who went to the elections, and
the C.P. rump 12 instead of 16. To-
gether the former (and still natural) allies
may number 40 in the Assembly against
25 for “Labor” ; and the reasonable con-
struction of this position is that the elec-
tors have replied to the wranglers of the
last Parliament that it is their job to work
together and that, with a majority reduced
to 15 in place of the former 31, they
may now be better disposed to do so.
“Labor’s” increased strength, from 17 to
25, when analysed represents no great
advance in electoral support; the seats
they regained were lost to them three
years ago by only a handful of votes
each. That recovery might have been
greater but for the tramway strike which
petered out only just before the elections.
. As a result of its change of objective
—from one of alliance with the Liberals
to one of holding the balance of power—
the Victorian Country party lost four
members (to the new L.C.P. organisation)
before the elections and four more at the
polls. The returns make plain beyond
question that the C.P.’s “balance of
power” can be used only for bargaining
to obtain a firm settlement with, the
majority party, if Victoria is to have any
hope of stable government for an in-
definite period ahead. The only other
possibility—an arrangement by the C.P.
. a Socialist Government (which
incidentally both “Labor” and C.P. leaders
ejected before the polls)—would spell
ultimate ruin for Mr. McDonald and his
(lowers. The Victorian elections have
remonstrated, as those in Queensland did
immediately before it, that there is no

diversion of such aid to serve any
renewed Franco-German rivalry in arma-
ments.
Any other nation may join in the new
plan, says the French Minister, and no
doubt the Benelux countries and Italy, all
dependent on Ruhr coal, would be glad to
do so. M. Schuman rightly says that an
agreement for internationalising the Ruhr
is an essential basis of Europeon economic
federation. It has been welcomed at once
by the West German Government, which
simultaneously announced its adherence
to the Western Union pact.
But the dismay of the Socialist Govern-
ment in Britain is not disguised by Mr.
Attlee’s formal welcome of the news.
Apparently a move for assuring
peace in Western Europe, for which
the British Government in the dis-
illusioned days of the late ’twenties strove
earnestly and long, is accounted how a
small thing compared with the buttressing
of the Attlee-Cripps socialisation plans.
British “Labor” has long been warned
to prepare, for the return of (Continental,
especially German, competition in over-
seas markets which British nationalised
industries have during their “Golden
Age” had to themselves. Socialism’s
easy times of “prosperity,” based on
scarcity, short hours and high wages—of
“soaking the rich” and distribution of
largesse from the Treasury among the
faithful—could not possibly last for long,
and now its day is nearly over. And a
good thing too, if value is ever to be put
back into the pound.
Cripps and his steel “experts” may have
to drop altogether their postponed plans
for nationalising steel, and, further, make
taxation concessions in order to permit
British steel to compete. The Socialists
are more likely than ever, with this
development, to find themselves out of
office after the elections which all parties
regard now as inevitable and expect about
next November.
It is high time something pulled them
up.
A Test of Sincerity.
The Federal “Labor” party has decided
this week to move several amendments
to the Communist Party Dissolution Bill,
but the accommodating attitude of the
Government which has adopted the —to
class-war politicians—startling innovation
of actually being ready to meet the wishes
of opponents when such a step does not
destroy their legislation seems to leave
them out on a limb.
The only point raised by “Labor” on
which Mr. Menzies will not give way to
a material extent is the onus-of-proof
clause, so that Mr. Chifley and Dr. Evatt
will be left with only a single feather to
fly with in their opposition to the bill.
It will not be enough to hold up either
of those heroes of democracy. Neither
of them has been exactly famous for
proving cases against his enemies, or
enemies of the Communist party whom
they interned during the war. In fact,
even where innocent men, like the
Australia-Firsters, had a complete answer
to charges against them, Dr. Evatt gave
them scant opportunity of proving their
innocence.
After it had been established that the
Australia First men had no connection
with, or knowledge of, the pretext for
their internment, an absurd conspiracy
to welcome the Japanese and murder half
the Australian population which was
hatched in Western Australia between
three or four irresponsibles and an ex-
Communist agent of Dr. Evatt, that mis-
sionary of legality, under privilege, in-
formed the public on the eve of a
judicial inquiry that his victims were “un-
doubtedly a quisling, subversive, anti-
Australian and anti-British group, pre-
pared to stab Australia in the back at
the moment of the greatest peril.” But
he failed to produce evidence which
would have hanged a dog to support his
statement.
All that onus of proof amounts to in
the Anti-Red Bill has been set out by
Mr. Richard Windeyer, K.C., a staunch
democrat:
(1) The prosecution will make an aver-
ment of guilt.
(2) If the accused does not deny this on
oath, this is to be taken as sufficient proof
of guilt The effect of such legislation
has been, and would be, to leave it to the
defendant to deny his guilt, and thereby
submit himself to cross-examination. If
such cross-examination leaves the matter in
doubt, the accused would be entitled to
acquittal; unless the prosecution, by calling
evidence, removes that doubt.
Mr. Chifley and Dr. Evatt have intro-
duced similar legislation and operated
under it. Their stand on the clause will
be a true test of their sincerity.
A.C.T.U. Battleground.
In Melbourne this week the A.C.T.U. has
gathered the first special congress of its
delegates—about 350 from constituent
unions—held for about 20 years.
Business: originally to devise action in
protest against delays in the basic-wage
hearing before the Arbitration Court; to
that is now added action by the unions to
demonstrate against the Commonwealth
Government’s anti-Communist Bill.
In other language, this business-paper
is to decide what to do about a basic-
wage claim (£lO a week) which can only
boost present inflation to the skies;
and to fasten on the whole “Labor”
movement denial of the right of
the Commonwealth Parliament to enact
legislation to check Communist sabotage,
which legislation the majority of' the
electors have enthusiastically approved.
Communist union leaders, the members
of their party’s general staff for the “cold
war,” make no secret of their belief that
they can capture this conference and
dictate the political action of the “Labor”
party through the governing body of its
industrial wing. If they do, then political
“Labor’s” insistence upon its opposition
to Communism, the dressing-up of the
AX.P. as an organisation holding nothing
in common with the Communist wreckers,
will be revealed as bogus. The Federal
“Labor” caucus has already made clear
that its attitude towards legislation
during debate in Parliament is decided
outside Parliament altogether.
During the whole of last year—nearly
10 months —the Arbitration Court’s hear-
ing of the basic-wage claim was occupied
by the union advocates and their witnesses.
More than once the court made repre-
sentations about the unnecessary pro-
traction of these proceedings. Such
“delay” as has occurred has been of the
unions’ own making. The Federal
elections and then the Christmas vacation
were causes of interruption in the case
which everybody concerned foresaw (if
(he hearing should extend for so long)
from the outset.
The Communists want A.C.T.U. en-
dorsement on these grounds for general
stoppage of industry throughout Aus-
tralia, and to link the two matters on the
agenda in order to force on “Labor” the
“united front” they have been preaching
as a shelter for their own policy and
operations. A.C.T.U. president Monk has
already gone a long way towards en-
couraging them. The A.L.P. is now
watching its professed friends mounting
for action the engines which will destroy
it politically for a generation.
Housing and Prefabs.
The housing problem is today the No. 1
headache of every Government in Aus-
tralia and the No. 1 heartache of hun-
dreds of thousands of Australians. Re-
search Service estimates that at the
1947 census there was a shortage of
197,000 houses or, including those dwel-
lings properly due for demolition,
310,000. Making allowances for
marriages, natural increase of population
and the very considerable immigration
in the period, this shortage had increased
by the end of 1949 to 212,000 or, in-
cluding demolitions, 325,000. This means
that, in the two and a half years to last
December, despite the activities of Gov-
ernment and private builders, new con-
struction did not even keep pace with
the increased demand, let alone teke up
any of the slack. The Commonwealth
Housing Commission towards the end of
the war had planned to have 50,000
houses erected or under construction by
the end of the first post-war year, rising
to 80,000 a year by the end of the third.
Actual construction in the third year was
just under 50,000, and in the fourth
(1949) approximately 55,500.
Taking the end of 1955 as the earliest
date by which it might reasonably be ex-
pected the shortage would be overtaken,
Research Service estimates that, to
achieve this, it would be necessary to
double the 1949 production rate, entail-
ing the employment of 212,000 men in
the building of homes —almost double
the present labor force—although this
number might be reduced if production
per employee improved and delays caused
by shortage of materials could be reduced
and the amount of work done under fac-
tory conditions increased. Even at that
rate —111,000 homes a year—there would
still be a shortage of 57,000 homes at
the end of the period; this shortage, it is
suggested, could be met by the importa-
tion of prefabricated houses.
The Australian Housing Mission at
present in Britain has been looking into
the possibilities of obtaining prefabs, in
large quantities. Three States as well
as the Commonwealth have already called
for tenders for prefabs.; Development
Minister Casey says the figure will run
into “a considerable number of thousands
a year for some years,” and the Housing
Mission, in a circular to the trade, speaks
of 15,000 to' 20,000 a year.
Although it seems a sad anomaly
that we should look to blitzed Britain and
war-torn Europe for relief from our hous-
ing difficulties, past and present perform-
ances suggest that unless we do so the
headaches and heartaches will be with us
indefinitely. The prefabricated houses
sought are not temporary dwellings; they
are permanent homes —not elaborate or
architecturally beautiful, but serviceable
and practical. One important argument
in favor of such a scheme is that imports
could be tapered off as local production
increased, ceasing altogether when the
backlog was overcome ; there would thus
be no problem of surplus labor in the
industry when “normal” building con-
ditions return and the industry merely
has to provide for current increases in
population and replacements for demo-
litions.
"You Can't Kill An Idea."
One of the most fallacious arguments
against the Federal Government’s bill to
outlaw the Communists is that “you can’t
kill an idea.” Those who accept it
haven’t learned to distinguish between
Communism, which is the idea, and
Communists, who practise it.
It’s true enough that no law can destroy
an idea, but laws can and do protect
people from the practice of ideas. Almost
every day the law is busy suppressing or
punishing people who have endeavored to
practise such ideas as bashing a citizen
and taking his wallet, selling beer with-
out a licence, robbing others by fraud,
murdering another person, infringing
health rules, assaulting females, breaking
industrial awards, stealing other people’s
property and so forth.
All the offenders so caught and
punished had ideas—and though the law
can’t kill such ideas it sets out to suppress
or punish those who try to put them into
effect, in order to protect the community
frotn these things.
The Communist idea is that Australia
should be a Communist State in a
hegemony of Communist States, all giving
allegiance to the top Communists in
Moscow, and that this should be the fore-
runner to a Communist world. Their
idea, where they are sincere Communists
and not merely agents of the Soviet
military dictatorship, is that all this would
make Australia and the world a sort of
paradise on earth.
But those who run the Communist
party go further. Ignoring the fact that
Australians don’t want a Communist
State (or because of it), Communists plan
to force it upon us by all possible means,
including treachery, civil war, disruption,
strikes, and violent divisions among the
people. They are prepared to lie, cheat,
commit fraud, betray and, if necessary,
kill to achieve their ends. They will, if
they can, and by any means, cause un-
employment, starvation and misery
because they believe that a people brought
to- those extremes would welcome
Communism. They have practised,
either here or abroad, all the things
charged against them.
In other words, they are prepared to
stop at nothing to put their idea into
practice. That is where the law comes in.
Any man may, in his mind, entertain the
most evil thoughts or ideas and the law
can do nothing. But the law can stop the
practice of the ideas, which is what the
Federal Government law means to do and
what the people of Australia expect it to
do with regard to Communism. To talk
about “you can’t kill an idea” in this
case shows want of thought.
Electricity and Development.
It seems that Eastern Riverina will be
first with hydroelectric power, and Albury
“Border Morning Mail” claims, with
some justification, that “within the next
decade the city of Albury will find itself
in the centre of the greatest hydro-
electricity generating scheme in Aus-
tralia.” The pleasant Murrayside city is
practically in the heart of the Snowy,
Hume and Kiewa schemes, which are
designed for an output of 3,000,000 kilo-
watts from waterpower.
Private and public use of electricity has
expanded so greatly since the war —it is
trying to expand further —that it has out-
grown power output. Lack of ordinary
electrical equipment for the use of power,
which has held up building in particular
as well as other construction, is being
steadily overcome ; but the more the pro-
duction of that sort of equipment in-
creases the more noticeable becomes the
inadequacy of generating equipment.
An estimate puts the number of addi-
tional electricity consumers connected to
power-stations for 1950 at 80,000, and
suggests that to cope with this demand
additional plant capable of generating
more than 250,000 k.w. will be installed •
“the first phase of a tremendous expan-
sion programme which will double

Australia’s power potential in six or seven
years.”
In a sense the failure of the coal in-
dustry to supply enough fuel for generat-
ing, for manufacture of iron and steel,
and for transport may prove a blessing in
the long run, since it has forced the
nation to begin development of its water
resources. There is a double benefit in
this, because most of the hydroelectricity
schemes are linked up with irrigation,
which in turn will bring more intensive
production from land now comparatively
unused.
The triple scheme in eastern Riverina
will generate a total of 3\ million k.w.;
2,860,000 from the Snowy, 289,000 from
Kiewa and 75,000 from Hume. The Vic-
torian Kiewa scheme is well ahead of the
other two —already its No. 3 station is
generating 26,000 k.w. from Bogong
waters. Kiewa is up in the Mt. Buffalo
country, where the rainfall is somewhere
around 80in, a year (snow and ram) and
the highest storage dam will be over
5000 ft. above sea-level Like the Snowv
scheme, it diverts rivers from their old
courses, in this case the headwaters o
Gippsland streams like the Tambo and
the Bargo. North of the range the waters
that flow down the Kiewa and Mitta
valleys into the Murray will spin g»
turbines sunk in artificial caverns m t

others. Mr. Casey, Federal Minister to

POLITICAL POINTS
Saturday’s voting in Victoria showed
conclusively that there is no room for
three conflicting parties in Australian
politics; the electorate is too evenly
divided for either of the two anti-“ Labor”
parties to get anywhere without the sup-
port of the other. On Sunday night, with
a couple of seats still in doubt —the Gov-
ernment candidate held a small lead in
each —the posit'on of parties was L.C.P.
28, C.P. 12, “Labor” 24, Independent
Labor one. “Labor” had improved its
representation by eight seats ; Hollway’s
party had lost four and the Country
party four. The political position
is thus “as you were” ; no party has a
clear majority. There is, however,
this difference —it should be clear to both
the anti-“ Labor” parties that another elec-
tion would most likely see them both
worse off. A settlement of their differ-
ences is therefore imperative.
Despite his party’s gains, it is futile for
Cain to claim the result as a moral win
for “Labor” or to say that it would have
won “if there had been an equitable dis-
tribution of electorates.” On Sunday-
night’s figures “Labor” had polled 512,000
votes against 564,000 for the other two
parties. In effect, Cain won back some
of the seats Chifley lost him in 1947 ;
with the threat of bank-nationalisation
removed the election was fought on State
issues alone.
Chifley’s presentation of “Labor’s” case
in the second-reading debate on the Anti-
Red bill reflected the hotchpotch of com-
promises which produced the case. His
party, he said, would not oppose the
sections banning the Communist party,
yet the main portion of his speech was a
condemnation of the ban. The Leader
of the Opposition has always maintained
that the best way to fight the Communists
is in the open, though for the greater part
of his term as Prime Minister he showed
a strong reluctance to fighting them at all.
In claiming that “the lessons of history”
showed that it was impossible to suppress
minority movements by force he quoted
only three examples—lreland, India and
China. He could hardly have been chosen
worse examples to support his argument;
the movements which won independence
for Eire and India were national move-
ments opposing minority rule from with-
out. China, never a democracy, has
merely exchanged one set of overlords for
another.
The surge of background noises which
were an accompaniment to the Chifley
speech were symptomatic of.his inability
to convince or hold the House on that
subject. This, in turn, was due to his
inability to convince himself.
From Mr. Chifley downwards most
“Labor” speakers seemed to be talking
with tongues in cheek: “I am against
Communism, but” ; “Communism is
a menace, but” ; “I yield to no one
in my contempt for the Communists,
but” . Most of the “buts” were to
the effect that to take action against the
Reds would merely send them under-
ground, where they would be more
dangerous than on the surface ; the rest
were allegedly grave fears that the legisla-
tion was aimed against liberty in general
and “Labor” members in particular. The
passage qf words between Ward and the
Prime Minister at the introduction of the
Senate reform bill seems to have been a
godsend to most “Labor” speakers ; study
of their speeches suggests that without
that very small bullet they’d have had no
ammunition at all,
Eden-Monaro Fraser’s contribution
easily took the prize for the best tongue-
in-cheek exhibit in the whole delicatessen
window. Adopting his favorite role of
champion of civil liberties, he delivered
a speech which to anyone hearing him
for the first time might have seemed a
model of tolerant sincerity—down till
the last minute of his time. Then he
stepped up his delivery to express-speed
and spat out a venomous attack on Prime
Minister Menzies, whom he described as
a tyrant and a renegade. That gave the
show away.
Fraser —like others who adopt the
attitude of I-may-not-always-be-right-but-
I’m-never-wrong—considers both sides of
a case judicially and then detides in favor
of his own prejudices.
McGirr’s Parliament petered out last
week with the Premier still playing hidden
numbers with the polling date. He took
comfort from Hanlon’s win in Queens-
land and Cosgrove’s drawn game in Tas-
mania, so possibly Cain’s partial revival
last Saturday may encourage him to name
the day. He’ll be an optimist if he really
builds any hopes on the apparent swing
back to “Labor” in Victoria. Cain merely
regained some of the seats lost when his
party was annihilated in the first surge of
popular indignation at Chifley’s Bank
Grab. When McGirr faced the electors
in May, 1947, the pendulum had hardly
begun to swing against “Labor.” More
important still, the electors had had only
three months of McGirr leadership; now
they’ve had three years.
Final counting in the Denison electorate
in Tasmania saw the Independent, Wedd,
squeeze past the post in company with
three “Labor” members and two Liberals.
Make-up of the new Parliament will thus
be; “Labor,” 15; Liberal, 14; Indepen-
dent, one. This still spells deadlock un-
less Wedd accepts the Speakership, which
seems hardly likely as it was his resigna-
tion of that post which forced the election.
In Queensland elections, says “Labor’s”
official journal, “the Liberal party, despite
an increased House from 62 to 75, gained
only two seats.” This ignores the gain
of eight seats in all by the Liberal-
Country coalition against “Labor’s” gain
of seven. This is called “Labor’s” re-
covery !
It is a principle well recognised among
housewives that the next-best thing to
getting new furniture is to shift your old
stuff round. Queensland Premier Hanlon
apparently believes in the same prin-
ciple ; his new Cabinet contains only one
new member,, but he has shuffled the jobs
of several of the old Ministers. Gair,
Minister for Labor, becomes Treasurer in
place of Larcombe, who moves into the
Attorney-General’s office, from which
Devries shifts out to become Minister for
Education. Jones, Minister for Health
and Home Affairs, takes on the Depart-
ment of Labor and is replaced by Moore,
previously in charge of Mines and Immi-
gration, which now goes to Power, whose
Works and Housing portfolio passes to
newcomer P. Hilton. Hanlon’s reason
is that a change-round brings a new
outlook periodically to the various depart-
ments. In other States this is effected
by periodical changes of Government;
in the perpetual-“ Labor” State it has to
be done withjn the party.
Municipal elections in Britain indicate
that the swing against Labor is still “on.”
Last year Conservative gains in the
councils were a pointer to the strong
revulsion, of feeling against the Attlee
party ; the trend was reflected in the heavy
losses Labor suffered in the general elec-
tion last February. In the current muni-
cipal elections Labor lost 82 seats and
the Conservatives gained 211, the balance
coming from Liberals and Independents.
With the Attlee Administration’s majority
a single figure, and the weather rather
vile, someone in Britain has called it
“government by influenza.”
General MacArthur in Japan agrees
with Menzies. Speaking of Japan’s new
democratic Constitution, he says the
ballot-box is no safeguard against Com-
munist intimidation and force:
The Japanese Communist party has
become the avowed satellite of an inter-
national predatory force. This raises the
question whether the party should any
longer be regarded as a constitutionally-
recognised political movement
The issue is clear and unequivocal—how
far may fundamental human rights be
exercised unabridged without becoming the
instrument of their own destruction.
Japanese Chifleys hold that outlawing
Communists is quite futile.
J, A. Beasley, Australian Minister to
the United Kingdom 1946-49, Minister
for Supply and Shipping 1941-45, M.H.R.
for West Sydney 1928-46, left an estate
passed for probate at £33,000. That’s a
better job of saving than most politicians
can manage. Joe Lyons and John Curtin,
dying in office, left very little ; at the
New Guinea timber inquiry evidence was
produced that the assets of E. J. Ward,
who had stated he had “no interest in
any private company and had never made
any private investments,” were £8924 ex-
clusive of a house and land. Beasley
went to Canberra three years ahead of
Eddie.
Communism is not the only subject on
which Federal “Labor” is at cross pur-
poses with itself. It used its Senate
majority to write into the Child Endow-
ment bill an amendment it knew the
Government would not accept, and many-
members made impassioned speeches on
the subject. Now the party’s executive
has decided that it wants the bill passed
in its original form after all. The final
decision rests with caucus; whichever
way it goes somebody’s face will be red.
“Poor old Holloway” is urging the
Government to seek a world-wide con-
ference “to outlaw war.” The trouble
about old Mars is that he wouldn’t recog-
nise a proclamation of outlawry if it was
pinned on him.
Last week the Federal executive of the
A.L.P. decided that the Australian Peace
Council was a subsidiary of the Com-
munist party and that no A.L.P. man
could be associated with it and remain
a member of the party. It looks as if
that broadminded democrat Senator
Morrow will have to make up his mind
which camp he is going to stay in—he
attended the Peace Council conference
in Melbourne and shared what spotlight
was not taken by the Red Dean. If
Morrow decides to resign from the
Moscow-inspired peace racket to save his
A.L.P. label he’ll be in good company;
Eddie Ward and Clive Evatt pulled out
of the Australian-Russian show in similar
circumstances. Jessie Street refused to
follow them, lost her “Labor” ticket and
is now the president of the Peace Council.
When McGirr described the Earle
Page health scheme as “a swindle” the
Federal Minister for Health commented
that instead of attacking his Government
for being slow in producing, a plan the
N. S. Wales Premier would be showing
more concern for the health of the com-
munity if it endorsed the Commonwealth-
States tuberculosis agreement formulated
in August, 1948, and still awaiting the
signature of the Ma State. A few days

During the trial of Dr. Fuchs it was
given out that the traitor’s activities were
unsuspected by the British Government
until American security men put them
on his trail. Recently Canada’s
External Affairs Minister Lester Pearson
in reply to a question in the Canadian
Parliament, revealed that Fuchs had been
named during the Canadian spy investi
gation in 1946, and that his name was
one of five which had been given to
British security agents. At Fuchs’s trial
it was mentioned that the first “informa-
tion” about him came from the US
authorities in the autumn of 1949. When
Mr. Pearson was pressed with further
questions he said:
Surely, when we had 150 to investigate,
it was Britain’s responsibility to investigate
five in their own country, including Fuchs.
Surely, indeed.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Percy Pawnticket”: There is an old
photograph of Pitt-street in a Sydney
bookshop showing on the vista a regular
forest of the posts that used to support
the shop awnings before cantilever awn-
ings—received at first with many fearful
misgivings—were introduced. Against
every one of those posts there is a man
leaning. Post-leaning was a notorious
characteristic of Australians in those old
leisurely days and the subject of much
Bulletin sarcasm. It seems to be one of
the country’s forgotten habits. It is not
merely that there cannot be post-leaning
if there are no posts to lean against, for
in the old days if there wasn’t a spare
“I can't turn corners with one hand yet."
post the leaners could always find a wall;
and there are still acres of walls. It is
simply that an old habit has been elimin-
ated, and forgotten without its passing
being noted. There is still the time to
waste; outside a big suburban pub the
other Saturday morning I saw a crowd of
60 or 70 men waiting for the beer to
come on; but although there were some
practicable posts in the vicinity not one
had its leaner.
“Fairf”: The bravest man I know is
an ex-serviceman who is unable to speak
and is almost completely paralysed in the
right arm and side. But his spirit is
still unbeatable, and the twinkle has never
left his humorous, brown eyes. Strangely,
he can still hum a tune, and his method
of wishing a friend a merry Christmas is
to hum a few bars of “Auld Lang Syne.”
The rest of his conversation consists of
signs, yet he rarely fails to make his
meaning clear to strangers, and his inti-
mates know exactly what he is saying in
the language of his own invention. But
sometimes the great-hearted fellow leaves
me wallowing. Recently I met him and
was being brought up to date with the
news. His son —not the biggest, the
second-oldest —had had a fight. The left
fist raised in position told me that. Not
a brawl. In the ring. A touch on the
ring he wore made that clear. He took
my hand and raised it above my head.
“He won,” I said delightedly. Jack
shook his head; his left hand made a
motion parallel with the ground, but his
head was still shaking. “He didn’t get
knocked out?” I submitted, and knew
that I had guessed rightly. “He lost on
points?” Another shake of the head
dismissed that suggestion. I was growing;
puzzled. Another thought came: “He
lost on a foul?” Again the shake of the
head. “He won on a foul?” I was
wrong once more. Now I was puzzled.
For a moment the ex-Digger seemed
stumped. Suddenly his hand moved to
his breast-pocket, took out an imaginary
pencil, and began to make graceful passes
in the air. I watched, completely be-
wildered ; the actions suggested sketching.
Then 1 woke up. “Draw! He got a
draw?” The brown eyes were smiling
with the triumph of another difficulty
defeated.

“Curtain Raiser”: There is a strong
movement afoot to make the compulsory
acquisition of English a part of the con-
stitution or something for New Austra-
lians. It is suggested that after a certain
period all d.ps. should come up for exami-
nation. And they’ll need it. I was in a
paint-shop the other day when a Balt
asked for two gallons of “animal paint.”
“What’s the cove want to do?” said the
shopman, looking helplessly at me. “Duco
an elephant?” “No,” said the N.A. “I
vant animal paint.” “Don’t stock it,”
said the shopman. “But no, dere it is,”
said the Balt, pointing to the enamels.

“Nakhoda”: I don’t know whether
there is any Spanish bullion sunk off the
Queensland coast (B. 3/5 / ’5O), but an
Australian I knew had so much faith in
a native legend that a Spanish ship from
Manila had been wrecked off the east
coast of Labuan island that he gave up
a second-mate’s job to spend the rest of
his life in a native house with a native
lady on a pleasant beach amongst the
coconuts on the remotest part of the
island. Once a month he came in to buy
stores, but if he saw a white man
approaching along the main street he
would vanish like a * spectre. I don’t
know how he got on, and would be
interested to know if the Australian occu-
pation of the island found him still living
on his hopes of fortune. There were-
grounds for them. Year after year the
Spanish home fleet assembled in Manila
Bay round about Christmas to catch the
trade-wind. Private trading wasn’t called
by ugly names like blackmarket in those
days, and every passenger and member
of the crew was allotted so much deck-
space for personal cargo, and they
naturally piled as much on their own
reservation as they could gather. There
was no Plimsoll-mark, and it is in
Spanish records that one year, of 90
galleons that left Manila Harbor, only
three lumbered into port in Spain.

and weight is supreme. A ten-ton truck
has the right of way no matter where he
is. Five-tonners get out of his road, but 11
run a ‘ute’ into the gutter. A ute’ll
always bluff a baby-car into giving way ;
and the bloke driving a horse knows
better than to stick out for his rights
against any of ’em. But when you’re on
a push-bike there’s just one way to keep
out of hospital: dash for the gutter when-
ever any of ’em toot. And it’s no use
givihg signals—they just toot and keep
coming. You haven’t got the weight to
hurt them, and if you haven’t got sense
enough to get out of their way they
reckon it serves you right.” And so on.
A month ago George was promoted to
truck-driver’s offsider. Last night I heard
him describing an adventure —with ex-
planatory charts drawn in spilt beer.
“Here’s the silent cop, and we’re coming

bike shot across here. Gripes, I don’t

way some of these blokes go on when
they’re on a bike it’s a wonder there’s not

“Morris the Tinker”: An accountant in
a Sydney factory whose services as J.P.
are in frequent demand by fellow-em-
ployees was asked by an elderly laborer
to witness an application he was making
for a block of Crown land. “I’m retiring,”
the old fellow explained,
“when I’ve got my house
built.” One item he had
to state in the application
was his assets. The J.P.
nearly dropped the paper
when his eyes caught the
figure—£l2,ooo. It isn’t
the only example I’ve en-
countered of well-endowed
people holding humble
jobs. When a young
fellow I worked in a big
Sydney department store.
The management gave
employees a chance to buy
shares. There was talk
among the staff of how a
waitress in the refreshment-
room had applied for
£4OOO-worth. The aston-
ished general manager had
asked her where she got
such a sum. “Oh, Dad
offered it to me,” she
answered. “He says the
firm’s shares will be a first-rate in-
vestment and I may as well have the
money now as when he dies.” One of
a group of employees I heard discussing
the incident then mentioned the name of
a salesman in the ironmongery depart-
ment, who, he said, was worth £7OOO.
A couple of others endorsed that state-
ment and one said, “People with that
much money should be barred from work-
ing for wages. They ought to be bosses
themselves.” A sentiment a*
echoed without dissent. P art y

“Bar Ney”: Saxon migrants (B.

followed the path of the Zwars of a
century ago. A New Zealand prisoner-
of-war from North Otago, while working
in a factory in Saxony, came under a
guard more kindly than the usual run.
Back home again he recalled the consider-
ation shown him by the guard and wrote
offering him a job in New Zealand and
undertaking to pay his fare. The German
accepted and recently arrived in Maon-
land with his seven-year-old son.

“Lao-dah”: The cabled report that
Frankfurt was all agog the other day over
the rumor that Hitler was alive in a
Tibetan monastery gathering his forces
together for a European comeback recalls
Napoleon’s brief stay on Elba. The
Corsican was not a prisoner on the island,
but its properly-installed sovereign, con-
veyed there aboard a British warship. It
was the Tsar who provided this face-
saving expedient of giving the ex-dictator
of Europe a bit of soil 19 miles by six
on which to lick his wounds; it cost the
Allies 100 days of battle. Six months
after his installation Nap, in his Emperor’s
dress, was approaching the shores of
France aboard a brig with six smaller
vessels and 1000 fanatical imperialists
behind him. He landed, distributed
Legions of Honor to all and sundry, and
a few days later was being galloped to
Paris, with the whole country shouting
“Vive VEmpereur.” When the Vienna
Congress heard the news it knew at once
that it would be the whole of France it
would be fighting, and within a few weeks
vast armies were moving towards the

French frontier. It was Napoleon’s

“P.0.M.C.”; In Sydney, too, stone-
masons are almost a forgotten tribe (B.
10/5/’5O), and ornamental stoneworking
will soon be numbered among the lost
arts. For instance, in spite of inter-
mittent agitations by the public and
historical bodies for the restoration of the
Sydney G.P.O. clock-tower, it seems un-
likely that even now skilled labor could
be obtained locally'to replace the many
intricately-cut stones damaged during and
since the dismantling. Incidentally, the
removal of the tower was a typical
example of one-eyed war-time official-
dom ; other city clock-towerS such as
those of the Town Hall and Central
Railway Station were not considered
menaces to life and limb and were left
intact.

“Aestur”: A British migrant in Tas-
mania recently arranged for the eviction
from his house of a family who had been
part-tenants for three years, and who had
been endured by previous occupiers even
though they had often made themselves
objectionable. When the newcomers took
oyer the cottage, the part-tenants made
vicious attacks on them —not a pleasant
welcome, and nobody blamed the
migrants for deciding to get rid of the
b s. They had to be evicted by force,
for they were ensconced behind an inner
wall; when some of the lining was re-
moved it was found that they had built
cells between two uprights: six rows,
each eight feet long, reaching to the
foundations. The cells were dripping with
honey, and the beekeeper who handled
the* eviction declared he’d never seen the
like before.

“Bo”; Whenever I pass a particular
house in a certain Sydney suburb I grin
at the memory of a humorous-minded
cove with a touch of imagination who
caused confusion to a little dictator. The
building-inspector was a cross-grained
crank who took a delight in trying to
catch unwary ratepayers contravening
minor building regulations. He had a par-
ticular snout on prospective garage-
builders, insisting on a host of amend-
ments to plans and thus often having the
application rejected. The village Hamp-
den had had three applications for his
garage-plans knocked back when one day
the b.-i. happened to pass the place, and
his dial took on a puce tint as he saw
the owner putting the finishing touches to
a garage near the street, a situation of
particular anathema to councils. Calling
the owner’s attention, he rasped And
what do you think you're building!
The other looked quizzically at the tyrant,
“You will observe,” he drawled, that I
am engaged in constructing a new power-
house for the Government.” “I know it’s
a garage,” bawled the other, “and I know
you didn’t get permission from Council
to erect it. If you don’t pull it down
within seven days Council will prose-
cute you! ” The other didn’t appear
unduly distressed at the threat. “Well,”
he said calmly, “if you’re around here in
eight days you’ll still see it up.” As the
other swung on his heel the ratepayer
“Me niece couldn't come today."
commented: “See these? Round things.
Wheels, They render the structure, not
a permanent building which requires a
permit under the regulations, but a
movable structure, which doesn’t. Now
run along, boy, you’re cluttering up the
landscape.” Council blustered, but lost.
The “movable structure” is still there.

“Lawnstob”; A practical joke -played
in Hobart had its repercussions recently
in Melbourne. Sid Hammond, who runs
a produce store in Hobart, had his shop
invaded by customers demanding fulfil-
ment of a promise posted outside that he
was prepared to sell 305.-worth of pota-
toes for 6s. 6d. A couple of weeks ago
Jack Mulcahy, licensee of the Grosvenor
Hotel in Melbourne, was similarly bom-
barded by thirsty individuals demanding
free beer. The Hobart produce man had
posted notices about the city' stating that
Jack would turn on free beer in honor
of the inter-State oarsmen who were in
the city practising for the King’s Cup.
Who posted the earlier notice can easily
be guessed. Both the alleged promises
were honored.

“Aestur”: “Clo’s” Pooh-Bah from
Perth (B. 19/4/’5O) reminded me of an
English rival who tickled my fancy a
year or so back. Someone wrote to
the “New Statesman” disagreeing with a
statement made by “Critic” in his weekly
“Diary”; the editor printed a reply from
“Critic” in which the correspondent was
advised to read a book on the subject
written by Kingsley Martin. The “New
Statesman’s” editor, “Critic” and Mr.
Kingsley Martin shared the joke, and
smiled to themselves with the one mouth.

“Gage Roads”: Fremantle was treated
to the sight of a flag rarely seen in Aus-
tralia when the 12,500-ton freighter
Atlantic Empire came in to load grain
for Bombay. The ship was launched in
Britain last year, is Greek-owned and
registered in Liberia. The flag, with its
13 alternate red and white stripes, is
similar to that of the U.S.A., except that
it has only one five-pointed white star
on the blue field of the jack. The simi-
larity is not surprising, because Liberia
was founded in 1822 by an American
Colonial Society to provide a home for
freed black men. The capital, Monrovia,
was named after James Monroe, the man
of the Doctrine, who was U.S. President
at the time.

“Vingter”: My first experience of regu-
lation-strike tactics were those employed
by a Torres Straits Islands official, who
smarted under Governmental refusal to
provide him with what he deemed
essential office accommodation to permit
him to conduct his daily interviews with
the Administration’s raw material on the
matters of spraying pigs, sorcery, marital
infidelity, infringement of gardening
rights and other routine matters. To
remove the necessity of conducting these
interviews in his living-room the official
contrived at the end of the bungalow
veranda a dovecote structure, which
housed only the sitting occupant, his
audience perforce standing outside. To-
wards visiting bigwigs from Thursday
Island the official was the soul of hospi-
tality right up to the moment in which
anything savoring of business matters
was mentioned, when he immedi-
ately led the way to the “office.” Here
he seated himself, leaving his superior
officer standing without dignity or com-
fort till the matter was threshed out.
Thereafter they adjourned immediately to
the living-room, where hospitality was
resumed, till the mention of administra-
tive matters compelled another adjourn-
ment to the “office.” Administration
caved in with the grant of a new office
when it was observed that the resident
man adroitly steered conversation towards
business topics just when it appeared that
the whisky was about to be passed.

“Spasebo”; Australians certainly do
sing when they’re happy (B. 3/ 5/’5O), but
they don’t do it very well. A crowd, re-
turning from a win by Carlton over
Collingwood will often express its
joyful feelings in a vocal manner, but
before they have gone far somebody is
certain to burlesque it. The pre-Com-
munist Russians were different. A
carriageful of soldiers or peasants would
break spontaneously into a lovely folk-
song and, apparently without any con-
ductor, would take bass, tenor and bari-
tone roles in perfect harmony. They
were not self-conscious about singing
well in public as an Australian would be.
That’s as I knew them before the first
war. What they’re like after years of
herding in mass-production plants and
munition-factories is another question,

“South Coast”: Do we sing for joy (B.
3/5/’50)? When I stepped gingerly round
our lady-help’s array of rags and polish
on the floor, I remarked “Not singing
today. Beryl? Not happy?” She con-
sidered that. “No,” she said. “My
work’s going on all right today, so I
don’t need to sing. I only sing when I’m
all behind and worried.” Perhaps she
has something there. After all, we only
sing to the unfortunate baby to comfort
ourselves. The baby, having feigned sleep
to get rid of the old man and his weird
ideas of harmony, waits until he tiptoes
out exhausted, then gurgles to its fingers
arid puts itself to sleep in its own good
time.
HIGH GENEROSITY.

Hies All he thought of was rushing off every
Ming after dinner to a two-up school. The only
pscnt he ever brought home was once when he was
an orchid and some saveloys.”
druDk . —Wife in divorce.
He was as mobile as the Flying Pieman,
Elusive as the Scarlet Pimpernel;
either ill-starred or skill-less as a “swi”-man
r When nightly for the cry of “Heads” he fell.
His obligations to the bond of Hymen
He looked upon as just a bagatelle.
The fact that such involved a wife to keep
Occasioned him no slightest loss of sleep.
He’d patently no strong predisposition
For pipe and slippers and his chosen mate
After encompassing the demolition
Of all she’d put before him on a plate.
j t W as a fatal, fatuous ambition
Drove him inexorably out the gate,
An urge that he could never overrule:
To get a run of heads and break the “school.”
Maybe ’twas all his wife’s misapprehension,
Her deeming that of her he thought no whit,
That really he’d the very best intention,
That when on Fortune’s lap at last he’d sit,
Able to give the horse-laugh to “the pension,”
A roll of tens and fivers in his mitt,
He’d do it proud—or so he’d like to think —
And clothe his spouse in costly silk and mink.
To know such generosity unbounded,
To heap such gifts around his lady’s feet
Wasn’t his fate. By evil fortune hounded,
He only gave her all the bills to meet.
But tarry! To his credit this redounded:
With offerings he tried to make her sweet
At least on one occasion. No, not rags,
But just an orchid and a bunch of snags.
It certainly would tax imagination
To find more ill-assorted gifts than these:
A blue-blood flower, queen of all vegetation,
A tethered row of thick-skinned mysteries.
A temporary reconciliation
He hoped these might effect —pathetic wheeze!
He wolfed the snags. His wife could not, you’ll
guess,
Display the orchid, for she had no dress.

HALF REFORMATION.
“Nearly half the pupils in a Czech secondary school
have signed a pledge never to smoke or drink alcohol.
In a resolution they proclaimed: ‘People who succumb
to drink have no place in our Socialistic society.’ ”
“We youth of Prague,” said newly-weaned Jan
Daken,
“On due consideration being taken,
Hereby aver —well, 49 per cent, of us —■
Vice is a curse, abhorred by every gent, of us.
Wherefore we do most solemnly declare
That we shan’t drink or smoke—or even swear.
As of today we dice grog, smokes and sex.
For us, no stigma of ‘dishonored Czechs.’ ”
“Come off it, mug,” spake Kurt, aged fourteen
years.
“Gimme a snort of port, a brace of beers.
You kids have still got milk behind your lugs.
When you’re as old as me, you’ll go the jugs.
How can a Socialist say that he’s fair dinkum
If he ain’t sociable enough to sink ’em?
Us 51 per cent, will wrap our dials,
Just like our dads, in beertific smiles."

ABORIGINALITIES
“B. A. Ker”: Although still running
swiftly, the upper Nepean has returned
to its normal course. Where it winds
through Cobbity (N.S.W.) the stream is
little bigger than a creek, but the might
of the torrent it was during the recent
floods is very evident. The middle hand-
rails of the stout bridge are gone, though
they would be at least 12ft. above the
normal water-level. Far up the paddocks
the paspalum is muddied and laid flat,
the heads pointing downstream. Fences
are broken down or draped with festoons
of flotsam. High up on a range of hills
is the water-mark: a fringe of silt,
swamp-oak needles and dead grass. Amid
this debris are pumpkins of various sizes
and several fruit-cases. An old broom
tells a tale of somebody’s home that was
flooded out; and a battered metal canister
contains what was probably that person’s
prized, if guilty, souvenir. It is a coffeee-
cup of striking design and excellent china,
the legend on the cracked bottom:
“White Star Line.” Where the slopes run
down to the river-bank the rabbits have
returned, and, taking advantage of the
easy digging, are extending the living-
quarters. But it is the trees that carry
evidence of the height—and might—of
the floodwaters. Hung fully 20ft. above
the ground on a limb of a thick blackbutt
is a flat wooden packing-case some 4ft.

lings, evidently jammed in the fork sft.

high in a bluegum will be a source of
wonder in years to come., No stranger
would believe that a log weighing per-

20-odd feet from the ground and another

“Vinaka”; On many of the outlying
islands of the Fiji group ( the native shows
the greatest respect for the banded sea-
snake, not so much because of its
dangerous bite but because of the snake’s
ability to change at will into a beautiful
young maiden whose chief object in life
is to seduce the young men of the village
from their homely tasks of copra produc-
tion, fishing or dalo-digging. Once they
fall for the siren’s charms they are irre-
vocably slaves of the snake, to die
immediately they rebel against serpentine
domination. It is quite easy to discover
the impostor, but usually the siren’s
beauty is so devastating that the swains
are caught before they can put the damsel
through the necessary tests. On close
investigation the left elbow of the snake-
girl will be found to point downwards.
Also, the transformed snake can be picked
easily if the girl is invited to sit on a
stinging nettle. If, in her innocence, she
does so, it proves conclusively that she
is a siren, for what normal girl would sit
on a stinging nettle? But there is one
certain precaution that will safeguard the
young men from these charmers. If each
morning he should cut through a branch
of the lawyer-vine he can with impunity
flirt with any beautiful village maiden or
even any strange one who suddenly con-
fronts him, secure in the knowledge that
he will be able to return home to his fish
and his dalo.

“Salmon Gums”: As “Fairf” says (B.
19/4/’5O) “aluminium is not one of
nature’s colors,” and that may be why
that moth was attracted to it. Ever seen
the prelude to the mating of moths? A
moth, presumably a male, will be observed
resting on a leaf. Suddenly it rises and
flies in a comparatively straight line for
anything up to 30 yards. Follow it and
you’ll find several other moths, coming
from different directions and all converg-
ing on the one point, around which they
all flutter anxiously. The object of their
search, a female moth, is practically in-
visible against her chosen background and
remains perfectly still, until she is dis-
covered by one of the males. The others
immediately become lost and, after aim-
lessly circling the spot a few times, drift
away. An explanation that satisfies me
is that the search is initiated by a broad-
cast appeal by the female, who keeps
her set operating until a male comes in
on the beam. The sudden cessation of
signals would account for the bewildered
action of the disappointed males. I think
this accounts in some measure for the
flight of moths to a flame or electric -
light, the light-waves being on the same
wave-length as the female moth’s broad-
cast. It is a known fact that every
element gives out its own particular radia-
tion—the spectroscope employs this know-
ledge to analyse the make-up of the stars
—and “F.’s” moth may have been
designed to respond to an emanation
corresponding to that from aluminium.
Nature, not knowing that man would
invent that substance, was probably quite
smug about that moth —provided, of
course, that I’m right.

19/4/’5O) can’t have used much hair-
restorer on his chest if, after a “whiff”
“The wife likes them fresh.”
of SO2, he “took the count.” In a S.A.
wine-cellar where I once toiled sherry
hogsheads were stacked in tiers three or
four high, each upper tier resting on
three-by-twos laid on the casks below,
Immediately before filling, each hogshead
was sulphured. A cellar-hand snagged a
bit of calico coated with sulphur on a
wire hook, lit the rag and dropped it,
suspended by the wire, into the cask, re-
placing the bung loosely. The filler as
he came to each hogshead placed .the
bung aside, withdrew the wire and put a
brass nozzle into the bung-hole. This
nozzle was connected by 2in. rubber hose
to an electric pump which kicked out
1800 gallons an hour. As the wine poured
in, the sulphur-smoke poured out of the
bunghole into the face of the filler. The
latter would have his head between the
casks above, right over the bung-hole.
He had to stay thus, listening intently,
because at 1800 g.p.h. a hogshead tops up
very quickly and the filler had to depend
on his hearing for the right moment to
yell for a switch-off of the pump. After
three or four hours of that a man was
filled with 802 from frontal sinuses to
the last air-space in his lungs. But we
never needed to seek medical attention
to be desulphured.
“Betcha”: Stan moved his boot to
watch the activities of a small nest of
ants. “Must be about the maddest things
on earth, ants,” he remarked, lighting an-
other fag. “Nearly got their nest cleaned
up again, from the dirt we chucked on it
yesterday. Think they’d take a tumble
to ’emselves, wouldn’t y’?” “What, an’
leave it in?” Les rolled over contentedly.
“No; but y’d think they’d shift off the
edge o’ the flamin’ table-drain,” Stan said
lazily, “instead o’ gettin’ buried every
time it’s cleaned out. Save ’emselves a
lot o’ work, if only they had any sense.”
Les grunted, looked at his watch, and
stowed away his lunch-bag. “Better do
a bit more,” he groaned. “Traffic’s been
held up long enough on this road. Did
you find the pipes? Where were they
this time?” “Aw, one was in the wash-

at the weather. “Think we’ll get any

HANDS.
So still they lay
Upon the polished wood,
As if exhausted from the long hard day.
I watched them secretly. From where I stood
They seemed like sunken snags: the desk the
river
Whose gleaming surface showed no swell or
quiver.
Black-rimmed they were and furrowed like the
sojl
On which their days are spent.
Scarred, calloused, twisted, gnarled and bent —
,Yet from them strength and courage seemed
to flow;
Kindness, a quiet peace and a sense
Of permanence.
And then I felt though all I knew should go
Crashing in the abyss of discontent,
And though my fellow-men
Gazed on the ruins, hope and courage spent,
I knew, whatever was of worth,
That hands like these would build it up again
From naked earth.

“Tidapa”: The claim is sometimes
made for the flying-fish that it is the
fastest swimmer in the sea. Taking into
account its air-speed, in which the lack of
resistance assists it, the ability of this
swimmer-cum-flier to mote is respectable.
But it is to be noted that it is when escap-
ing from a hunter fish that the flying
bloke leaves his natural habitat and takes
to the air. In the Indian Ocean the flying-
fish provide sustenance and sport for the
two kinds of marlin, the sailfish and a
speedster of the barracuda type named
by the Malays Ikan Lekas, and to the
latter must be given the speed belt of
the ocean. The streamlined perfection of
the»marlin and sailfish allows these giants
of the sea speed in excess even of that
of the porpoise, which is reputed to be
capable of 50 m.p.h., but Ikan can always
beat the marlin to his prey.

if I’d SuS glory —tr-tree. Perhaps
had to cook with it as fuel my
opinions would have altered somewhat;
still, old inhibitions die hard, and some
ot my earliest boyhood pleasures em-
braced ti-tree. The scrub variety had a
ball root that needed very little trimming
to be a formidable-looking war club, and
even less attention to be a hockey stick.
Another variety had a bent taproot that
simply cried out to be pared down into a
primitive boomerang. Our cubbies were
generally constructed of the scrub, de-
spite the inevitable ti-tree itch and
showers of prickly spines that fell down
as the bushes dried. In later years hard
times were made a little better by the few
shillings gained from the sale of the
paper-like bark of the bigger trees, fer-
neries being the vogue of the moment
and the bark ideal for lining wire baskets.
Now I read with delight that industrial-
ists have proved ti-tree bark can be
made into cork equal in quality to the
imported article. Australian lino, fac-
tories are using it extensively in their
products. Incidentally, I have been
cowardly enough to stick to the tra-
ditional spelling, but Sydney Techno-
logical Museum spells the name “tea-
tree.” If the story is true that Captain
“I think my watch must have stopped."
Cook’s men thought the scrub was tea
growing wild, the Tech.’s spelling seems
indisputable.

“Pip Tok”: A Government trapper
who caught a mother dingo just before
she whelped removed six unborn pups
from her. The heads and tails of the
pups, along with evidence of the mother’s
death, he sent along to the York (W.A.)
Road Board in support of a claim for
payment on account of the whole family.
He was paid £1 bonus on the dingo and
a bob on each pup. When the secretary
asked the next meeting of the board to
approve the payment the board decided
to refer the matter to the Vermin Depart-
ment, whose job it is to refund such pay-
ments to the boards concerned. The
question is still to be resolved by the
department’s Solomons.

“Kelvin”; The penal settlement main-
tained by the Dutch at Merauke right up
to the outbreak of the Jap war proved
that headhunting (B. 26/4/’5O) was not
a lost art among the Fly River tribes
over the Dutch border. The Administra-
tion guarded the prison settlement on the
coast and flanks only, leaving the job of
policing the hinterland escape route to
the unpaid but enthusiastic Tugeri gentry,
who were partial to exotic dishes in the
form of would-be absconders. I remember
a round-the-world canoeist who passed
through the Torres Straits islands in 1934,
en route to Java via the Fly River littoral.
Oldsters among the some of
whom bore livid neck-scars as reminders
of the occasion on which they came
within an ace of providing trophies for
the Tugeri sportsman, looked at the
radiant aluminium canoe and prophesied
sadly that he would make “for Tugeri
feller No. 1 kai-kai.” I never learned
the fate of the canoeing globe-trotter, but
to this day Torres Straits mothers hush
fractious offspring with the mere mention
of the Tugeri bogeyman.
* * * *
“Tarbush”: A routine job at our place
is the nightly walk round the premises
with rifle and torch to discourage the
foxes which poke into the backyard after
scraps and a possible stray hen. Going
out on a recent night I picked up in the
torch beam one dazzling blue-green eye,
apparently close to the ground, and quite
motionless. It was far too big and
brilliant to be the massed optics of a
ground spider, and it didn’t move off
fitfully as cats’ eyes usually do. I moved
in on the thing, picking bare ground so as
not to make a disturbing noise, and
eventually finished up within about Bft. of
a nightjar lying like a brooding hen on
a bare claypan. At that range the one
eye that was visible changed to a deep,
burning red. The bird continued to stare
without apparent discomfort at the torch
for perhaps a minute, and then, with the
effortless ghost-like motion of the owl
tribe, it simply floated into the air and
was off to resume its hawking for the
insects that gather at the light from house-
windows.
* * * *
“Curate’s Egg”: Certain facial char-
acteristics of the new rouseabout, who
signed on at the shed under a name similar
to that of a city pug who used to be in
the news, discouraged questions, though
the stranger never actually claimed that
he and the city slugger were identical.
He never threw his weight about, but,
after spending a week getting his bear-
ings, he installed himself without osten-
tation on the petrol-tin seat of the ring-
keeper at the Sunday-morning swy school,
thereby usurping the throne Chilla had
occupied by right of conquest since the
beginning of the run of sheds. Chilla
accepted the position with the air of a
good grass-fighter who recognises the
superiority of a trained man. Those who
had looked forward to a gory contest
had long got over their disappointment
when one Sabbath morn they were sur-
prised to see Chilla installed in his old
office of honor. When the reputed pug
arrived they shaped up in stony silence.
The battle was brief but bloody, and when
some time after he had been revived
Chilla was asked why he had suddenly
thrown discretion to the winds, he drew
from behind his swag the sporting sheet
he had found in one of the huts, and
pointed to an announcement that the pug
bearing the name of Chilla’s conqueror
was due to fight in the city on March
16, which was the very day of the debacle
at the Wiregrass shed. “This bloke must
be an impostor, but he’s pretty good just
the same,” said Chilla through his
battered lips. Just then someone spotted
the dateline on the paper—it was two
years old.

“Flinders Range”: In this slice of
northern S.A. the most conspicuous
vegetable after rain is the prickly acacia-
bush that colonises watercourse flats.
Given a drop of moisture it throws out
a wealth of vivid green that is literally
startling in a landscape built up of brown-
reds and blue-greys. Besides its orna-
mental value, its use as dry-time browsing
for sheep and its excellent firewood, this
acacia is a soil-holder and a soil-builder.
In a few years 20 or 30 of the bushes
can turn a bare flat into an oasis of tall
herbage after rain. The pity is that, be-
cause of their edible properties, so few
young plants ever succeed. One sees the
tiny seedlings with their delicate, fern-
like leaves for a few weeks in a good
season. Later, often before the leaves
give way to the adult phyllodia, they dis-
appear. Yet in the vicinity of a fettler’s *
camp in this district one can always find
strong young plants—but there sheep
seldom venture and rabbits are non-
existent.
* * ♦ ♦
“Spoke”: A remarkable piece of luck
enabled Norman Favaloro, of the Mel-
bourne National Museum staff, to bring
back a specimen of the very rare blue
petrel from Macquarie Island in the Ant-
arctic. This member of the Prion family
hasn’t been seen since 1901, and one of
few specimens extant has lain in the
strongroom at the Museum since 1860.
Favaloro happened to be watching the
shore party signalling the ship one night
when he observed a bird fly into the
beam and grabbed it. It turned out to
be the blue petrel.
* * * *
“Wonk”: Herb paused on the ridge to
stare as the horseman on the far bank
urged his mount into the river. The
horse went in gamely. Slowly it waded
to the saddle-flaps, slipped in a hole and
went under, swam for a bit, striking
bottom once more, battled with the
current and finally clambered out some
distance downstream. Herb spurred down
the bank. “You darned fool, crossing
there,” he bawled at old Charlie. “You’ll
be getting drowned if you’re not care-
ful.” “Aw, I always cross there,” Charlie
defended stoutly. “I know that place an’
I ain’t never been drowned there yet.”
“That’s not to say you won’t be,” Herb
lectured. “Why don’t y’ go round by
the bridge?” “What, ride five miles!”
roared Charlie. “Aw, go ’n’ get y’r ’ead
read.” He continued to cross the river
at the same place, despite all protests, and
Herb made a practice of riding that way
to see that the old chap was safe. Then
one morning he spotted Charlie turning
resignedly upstream, and nearly an hour
later ran into him coming down on the
near side. “Went up to the bridge, did
you?” Herb greeted him. “About time
you woke up that crossing is risky.” “Aw,
well,” frowned Charlie, “most times it
don’t matter; only y’ see, I just paid
ten bob f’r new shoes f’r that nag an’
I don’t want t’ ruddy well lose ’em.”
SUMMER SUNRISE.
- „ mpr lay over the land as we went
where the daybreak lay ribboned and rent—
still comely, not withered and brown,
white unto harvest the paddocks rolled down,
Sr with seed-time the acres unfurled
From the edges of night to the ends of the
world.
nh the glory of morning! Before us the wide
sweep of the sun-rising ran like a tide,
Rose like a torrent and flowed like a sea
Hieh over level land, low land and tree
Till every ghost of the darkness was laid,
And the great shade grew lesser and ceased to
be shade.
fold of Ac grass-harvest, gold in the air—
A ereat golden country, this time of the year!
pitched in the hollows and patched on the
Camps'of’ Australian gypsy bluebells;
And edging the roadway, wherever we pass,
Withering ribbons of wallaby-grass.
A shallow lake fringed with lean rushes and wan
Where flicks the blue swallow, where floats the
black swan;
Mirrored clouds forming and fading and driven
Out of the blue to some other blue heaven;
Leagues where the long paddocks level and
meet
Till the whole world is nothing but ripening
wheat.
Nothing but wheat and the white cockatoos;
Grey galahs rising and changing their hues —
All in an instant, fifty as one,
Turning to pink in the path of the sun;
And ever before us the far mirage shone,
Ever the dancing airs beckoned us on.
Oh, the great golden countryside! Beautiful
still
To me is each hinterland, gully and hill.
For joy you have given me, all you still give,
I shall love and re-love you as long as I live.
Till I go to my rest, with my own little part
Of this great golden country heaped over my
heart.

Above reserves are subject to goodwill and trade-
marks amounting to £296,065.
Murdoch’s, whose ordinary shares have
undergone two sharp swings in price
within a few weeks, has been an over-
capitalised business ever since the present
company took over from a proprietary
at the crest of the boom in 1929 —paying
£624,285 for assets that did not include
the Park- and George-street building. In
the price £296,064 was for goodwill.
Very soon the new company had to face
slump conditions, and no ordinary divi-
dends were paid for 13 years after 1931,
while the prefs. have been subjected to
the 22\ p.c, permissible cut ever since
that date.
Started by the late James Murdoch in
1893 on the site it still occupies at the
South-west corner of Sydney’s “men’s-
wear block,” the business is one of that
city’s best-known men’s outfitters, and
has lately turned a hand to selling
women’s clothing as well. On the upper
floors of the building Murdoch’s has its
own factory for some clothing lines. This
property has belonged outright to the
company since 1934. It was bought
for about £393,000 from Murdoch’s
Investments Pty., a family concern to
which the freehold is still heavily
mortgaged.
Murdoch’s shared in the sellers’ market
for clothing that developed during the
recent war, and in 1944, when the ord.
shares were first listed on ’Change, they
collected a 3 p.c. dividend after their
long famine. The rate moved up to 5
p.c. in the last three terms, but there was
a drift back of £4264 in the last net
profit; this was shown at £37,192 after
undisclosed tax and other expenses. After
paying the pref. dividend it represented
5.6 p.c. on ordinary capital, compared
with 6.4 and 6 p.c. in the two previous
terms.
The general difficulties that prevail for
retailers at present —rising costs, reduced
profit margins—have evidently been still
more severe in the current term, for the
board announced at Easter that there
would be no ordinary dividend for the
half-year ended January 31. Thereupon
the £1 shares, which have rarely been
up to par since listing, drifted as low as
13s.
However, as rumors grew of an im-
pending merger between Murdoch’s and
another (highly successful) retailing busi-
ness, the scrip began to regain favor.
Since the board officially advised share-
holders this month that negotiations for
some “workable arrangement” are in fact
under way, the market has set a value of
par or a little higher. The pref. shares,
which had been slightly less than a par
proposition for a long time, have not
strengthened.
The questions for the sharemarket
have been: (1) whether the merger
negotiations are likely to come to any-
thing ; (2) if so, what- prices Murdoch’s
are likely to obtain for goodwill and the
freeholds. Goodwill still figures in the
books at the 1929 figure. Freeholds
include not only the big city building (at
cost price plus additional expenditure)
but a property in Reservoir-street, Surry
Hills, that used to be occupied by the
Murdoch’s manufacturing subsidiary but
is now leased to outside tenants:

ing rate last term, despite an increase of
nearly £40,000 in net profit after taxation.
But Stock Exchange quotes have since
risen by ss. and the current yield from
the scrip has tightened to 4.5 p.c.
In 13 years the Repco group has be-
come quite a factor in the car trade;
efficient management has modernised the
plant and widened its scope so as to
share in servicing the army of motor
vehicles (over 1.3 million strong) now
on Australian roads. The board hopes
to participate further in making parts
for locally manufactured cars and trucks,
and it has set up a unit for servicing
tractors. Operations are mostly* in Vic-
toria, but lately there have been inter-
state acquisitions as well.
Repco itself is a holding company, and
a list of the main subsidiaries shows its
ramifications; the first three are the
originals, bought from R, G. Russell in
1937, and these, together with the Paton
Brakes business, remain the most import-
ant units:
Replacement Parts Pty., Ltd. —Established
1926, is the importing and merchandising sub-
sidiary, with branches in Victoria and Tas-
mania; it also makes electrical equipment.
Russell Manufacturing Co. Pty., Ltd.—
Large-scale makers of pistons, piston-rings,
cylinder sleeves and valve guides.
Auto Grinding Co. Pty., Ltd. —Established
1921, has auto-engineering and reconditioning
plants in Melbourne.
A. T. Richardson and Sons Pty., Ltd. —
Acquired by Repco in 1942, makes flywheel
ring-gears and does general auto engineering.
' Repco Bearing Co. Pty., Ltd. —Formed a
few years ago to take over the manufacture of
engine bearings in Melbourne and Launceston.
Patch’s Brake Replacements Pty., Ltd. —
Founded in 1927 and acquired by Repco in
1947 for £300,000: price being covered by an
issue of 150,000 £1 shares at, a 20s. premium.
Warren and Brown Pty., Ltd. —Motor
engineers and tool-makers of Footscray, bought
in 1949.
Precision Metal Stampings, Pty.—Sydney
manufacturers of oil-seals, bought in 1949.
To finance all the expansion and the
new adoptions, capital has been doubled
in the last two years. Some units are
still in the development stage, some have
apparently had to pay arrears of tax out
of their recent profits, and the general
presentation of accounts is now to be
overhauled. Still, the figures aa they are
show that in relation to capital employed
the trading return was appreciably
lower last term. It was smaller tax (down
£30,930) and depreciation (down £11,648)
that left the net figure higher:

The latest accounts took in the profits
of one big subsidiary for 11 months
only; but the rate of increase in sales
slowed down last year, says the board, and
could not offset rising costs whilst selling
prices were largely controlled. Wages-
bill for the group’s 1600 employees was
£724,000, and is likely to be higher again
this year.
Despite the £152,300 extra capital and
the £179,550 of premiums that was
raised with it, the board still had to go
to the bank for a further £101,141 to
finance expenditure on fixed assets
(£164,079), and the large rise in stocks
carried (£246,053):

will require £116,250, or £25,886 less than
was earned last term. The £1 shares
(which now have net tangible asset back-

tion.

It was In 1939 that Warren and
(QJ came down to Sydney, to trade there
through a. subsidiary called Linen S
Pty., which limits its agencies to women’
wear And four years ago a Meibom
subsidiary, John Warren and Co Sf
joined the family, but failed consistento
to pay its way, so operations in Mel
bourne are now “suspended for the time
being.”
Ihree years ago the investing public
became interested in all this when Warren
and Strang (Q.) issued 30,000 new £1
shares at par, raising capital to the present
figure of £60,007 ; there had previously
been a £lO,OOO bonus issue from reserves
for the old shareholders.
Profits for the four years ending June
30, 1946, were quoted in the prospectus as
averaging £7503 after allowing tax on a
public-company basis. The 1947 accounts
at first showed a profit exceeding £7OOO,
but tax commitments settled since have
reduced the figure to £4687. In the last
two terms, the net profit after undisclosed
tax was £7616 and £7843, representing
about 13 p.c. in each case on present
capital; the dividend has been kept at
8 p.c.
The board offers little comment on the
latest result, but apparently the Linen Hall
subsidiary turned in a net loss of £9Bl
after meeting some prior tax liabilities
out of the year’s profit. The Melbourne
subsidiary also presumably suffered a loss
until closed down during the year. The
consolidated profit was, however, £227
higher than in 1948, But that seems,
from the chairman’s remarks 18 months
ago, to include certain final subsidy
adjustments from the Commonwealth
Government which were received early
last term, but really related back to other
periods. The remdval of textile subsidies
has been one factor to make the going
tougher for - softgoods traders, who no
longer enjoy the conditions of a sellers’
market.
During last term the board slightly re-
duced the value of stocks despite higher
price-levels. Debtors’ balances rose by
£12,888, for which the bank advanced an
extra £17,348 whilst other creditors were
repaid £6113. On balance, current assets
exceeded liabilities by £62,451, an im-
provement of £4036 over the twelve-
month.

Bitumen and Oil Refineries
Allowing for generalised
fluctuations, the sharemarket has
maintained a pretty steady atti-
tude towards Bitumen and Oil
Refineries scrip both in the period
0 f waiting and now when a
profitable trading basis seemsi
to have been established. The
company was formed early in
1946 to set up a refinery (non-
polymerising) near the Bun-
nerong power-station, at Botany
Bay, Sydney. This was to be
Australia’s second refinery, the
first belonging to the Common-
wealth Oil Refineries ; but since
the Bitumen and Oil (“Boral”)
project two more have been
erected, by the Shell and Vacuum
companies respectively. Shell is
Boral’s only rival in Sydney.
American interests are closely
associated with Bitumen and Oil.
Of the co.’s £1,250,000 capital,
40 per cent, is held by the Cali-
fornia Texas Oil Co., Ltd.—
which is in essence a jointly-
owned subsidiary of two U.S.
titans, the Texas Oil Co. and the
Standard Oil Co. of California.
Crude oil for treatment at
Bunnerong comes from the Cali-
fornia Texas Oil Co. The
original intention was that the
main Bunnerong products would
be petrol and bitumen; Boral
was to market the bitumen on
its own account, but would turn
over the petrol and other oils to
Caltex, Ltd., which is another
subsidiary of California Texas
Oil Co. In effect, the latter is
selling crude oil to Boral and
buying back refined —with prices
flexible at both ends.
The efficient and economically-
run refinery was finished and
ready for operation in the latter
half of 1948. This was some-
what later than schedule, and
the original estimated cost of.
£700,000 was exceeded, partly
because of late modifications to
the design. As the plant
approached readiness, it was
clear that the anticipated market
for bitumen sales had not'
materialised —in fact there
existed “considerably less than
half the estimated demand.” New
competitors had entered the field
and public authorities are held
up in their road-making plans.
It was therefore necessary to
convert the Bunnerong plant
from bitumen to the production
of diesel oils. This was not
accomplished until March, 1949.
Meanwhile, the production of
ordinary motor spirit has pro-
ceeded according to plan. In this
respect, the financial year that
ended last June 30 was produc-
tive for about 10 months; in
regard to other products, for a
much shorter period.
That was the company’s
first profitable year. Gross profit
was £129,443; and after
charging administrative costs
(£62,491), interest on bank and
other advances (£23,705) and
depreciation (£52,610) the board
declared a net profit of £40,747,
representing 3.2 p.c. on capital.
It was decided not to declare
a dividend, but to use most of
the net profit in reducing the
company’s establishment ex-
penses. However, an interim
dividend at an annual rate of 6
p.c. has been paid (after some
hesitation) in respect of the first
six months this term.
Last year the board effected
a small reduction in the bank
overdraft, which still remained
substantial at £360,910. Stock-
in-trade had almost doubled and
there was a large increase in
ordinary trade debtors:

Benefits of full-scale produc-
tion in the Current term —and
some improvement in the bitu-
men trade—were said to have
produced “most satisfactory”
profits for the first half of this
term, and the position may
have improved further with the
abolition of petrol-rationing.
Since last winter Bitumen
and Oil scrip has recovered on
the Stock Exchange from 235. to
295. 6d. At the latter figure, the
scrip would yield 4.1 p.c. on a
6 p.c. dividend.
Gold-price Decision
Eight months ago the Inter-
national Monetary Fund ordered
its executive board in Washing-
ton to report upon the South
African proposal (supported by
Australia) for an increase in the
price of gold; also upon an
alternative proposal that the
Fund should approve sales of up
to 50 p.c. of a producing coun-
try’s output at “free” prices
above the pegged rate of $35
an ounce. The executive board
now recommends that both
claims be rejected. The Fund
is certain to adopt that course;
but South Africa’s Finance
Minister says he “reserves the
right to sell gold at the best prices
available,” while Australia, no
doubt, will accept the Fund’s
ruling.
The board’s argument (as
cabled) was threefold; (1) If
gold were dearer, the amounts
which flow into private hoards in
Oriental countries would absorb
more of the present foreign ex-
change receipts of those coun-
tries and impair their monetary
reserves; (2) premium sales of
gold would make it harder to
restore international balance,
causing more severe exchange
and import restrictions; and (3)
premium sales would undermine
the stability of currency ex-
change rates.
The first argument seems to
assume that a raised world price
for gold would not itself affect
the internal prices nor the
physical rates of hoarding in
Eastern countries. The second
argument is important and gener-
ally valid for the Marshall Aid
nations. It certainly does not
apply, however, to South Africa’s
balance of trade, nor does it
answer that particular country’s
grievance»that one of her major
exports is finding its way
to U.S.A. at prices that are
kept artificially cheap. The
third argument of the executive
board appears to be aimed at the
proposal for partial sales of gold
above the pegged price (where
the argument is strong), rather
than against an all-round rise
in price (where it is not)
The board’s decision, taken
from a global point of view, is
not surprising, but it need not
be regarded as the last word on
gold prices for all eternity. It
remains to be seen just what
South Africa intends to do, or
can do, about premium sales.
The unofficial price of gold has
weakened lately, one reason be-
ing the new regime in China.
Russia, incidentally, as a pro-
ducer, supported the move for
a higher world price.

A Steadier Sharemarket
There was a steadying in the
market last week, B.H.P. at
545. settling down at about
2s. 6d. under the recent record
price, and A.C.I, about Is. 6d.
lower at 555. 3d. Tooth shares
have shown little or no change
in the swiftly-moving market of
the past three weeks; they
closed at 935. 6d. last Friday.
The market is expecting some-
thing here. Burns Philp sup-
porters were not satisfied with
the 12i p.c. div., and, after sales
at £5, there were dealings at 955.
There was market disappoint-
ment, too, with the premium
charged on the C.S.R. issue.
C.S.R.-holders are more
accustomed to bonuses than to
premiums. The 35 p.c. premium
charged is regarded by the
board as being some offset
against the inflated prices that
the co. will have to pay in main-
taining and expanding its under-
taking. It is suggestive that pre-
vious provisions for deprecia-
tion and replacement, however
generous, are not meeting
charges for replacement and
providing that inner reserve for
which the C.S.R. has always
been famed.
Bradford Cotton recovered to

Chief problems of all industry
remain the questions of costs, of
raw-material and fuel supply, of
labor available, of transport and
of anomalous taxation. There
is a vast unsatisfied demand still
ahead of our essential in-
dustries, more particularly those
interested in building and con-
struction. Because of profit-
restriction resulting from a
number of factors share prices
have not yet inflated to the same
degree as most other values and
costs.
Roma Gas
“Petro”: At 2.30 p.m. on May
9 inflammable gas issuing from
an artesian bore being drilled at
Hillside, a grazing property
about 35 miles north-east of
Roma in South Queensland, was
ignited by the striking of a
match at a distance of 60ft. from
the hole. Four men suffered
burns to the face and arms from
the resulting explosion. The
explosion is stated to have
thrown water, gravel and flames
to a height of 100 ft.
The well had been drilling for
some weeks, and struck water at
a depth of 760 ft. on the morning
of the day on which the explo-
sion occurred.
In view of past records of
bores sunk in the Roma district,
it is surprising that the fire risk
was not appreciated. It is
remarkable, also, in view of the
time and money it has spent on
the geophysical examination of
the Roma area, that the Mineral
Resources Bureau was not keep-
ing a close watch on the well if
only for information as to
directional lateral changes in the
physical characteristics of the
underlying strata. Such data
are vital to the correct interpre-
tation of the readings obtained
from the several geophysical
methods employed by the bureau
around Roma.
Pending an examination of
the samples of gas collected and
sent to the Government analyst
in Brisbane, it is not certain
whether the gas is “dry” (that is,
without a measurable content of
condensible paraffins, and prob-
ably consisting of a mixture of
methane and carbon-dioxide) or
“wet” (indicating that conditions
•favorable to the generation of
petroleum exist at this point).
The fact that the driller whose
match ignited the escaping gas
did not notice any petroleum
odor would indicate that the
gas is “dry.” The behavior of the
well, as reported, indicates that
a pocket of gas was collected
and drawn into the bore by the
flow of water in the aquifer after
it had been tapped by the drill.
Whether the gas is “wet” or
“dry,” or whether it is
panied by small amounts of oil
or not, has no fresh bearing on
the prospects of commercial oil
at Roma.
The fire was extinguished 14
hours after it started by corking
the hole with a 44-gallon drum
and then blowing out the reduced
flame with the blast from 51b.
of gelignite hung over the well.
This is strong indication that
there is no commercial volume
of gas behind the blow and that
any oil-spray is lacking also.
The method employed would
have had no hope of success in
checking a fire over a com-
mercial reservoir of either
natural gas or oil. That is not
meant to belittle in any way the
good arid courageous job done
by the men who extinguished the
fire.
When the news of the gas
blow reached the near-by town
of Wallumbilla a mass rush to
the bore occurred, and it was
necessary to call a squad of
police from Roma to control the
sightseers and to prevent them
from entering the danger zone.
The reaction of the Stock
Exchange has been a hardening
of sellers’ quotations, but little
change in buyers’ offers.
N.Z. Newspapers
Newspaper profits, like those
of most other Maoriland cos.,
seem to be levelling out at a
shade under post-war peaks, but
they’re still on a fairly high
plateau. N.Z. Newspapers, Ltd.,
owner of the Auckland “Star”
and the Christchurch “Star-
Sun” and part-proprietor of
leading provincial journals,
slipped back £1695 to £61,249
in its latest term (to March 31),
with the first break in an up-
trend that began back in the
mid-war years and gained
momentum after the war ; but
the co, is in a comfortable
enough position to convert its
1949 8 p.c. div. and 2 p.c. bonus
to a 10 p.c. div. basis.
After a string of 8 p.c. yields
for 11 years before the rise,
investors lately decided it was
time to revise ideas of the value
of the 16s. Bd. shares, which
had a ceiling of £2 12s, 6d. last
year. On prospects of a run of
10 p.c. yields, however, the scrip
is tightly held. Offers 4s. above
last year’s high mark haven’t
been tempting enough. Reserves
have snowballed to £198,156,
including floating funds of
£78,156, without taking in
£70,000 set aside for machinery
obsolescence, which has been
mounting annually, and there’s
a sizeable hidden reserve besides,
in properties and plant, listed at
£298,898, which would cost a
fortune to replace.
Here’s the trend:

For 30 years the co. has been
ably directed by knight Cecil
Leys, who consolidated the
evening-Press monopoly in both
metropolitan centres where it
operates. Plant modernisation
and rebuilding, to cost the best
part of half a million, is just
getting going, and will bring
big balance-sheet changes from
now on. Population growth has
gained a lead of a decade, due
to war and post-war hold-ups, so
there’s a good deal of leeway to
catch up.
The premium of £7 charged
on the new issue of C.S.R. £2O
shares ■ (one for five) disap-
pointed the market, and there
was a net fall on the first day’s
trading of £2 ss. a share, to
£72 15s. Quotations at the end
of last week were still around
that figure. It is the first occa-
sion in the last half-century that
the C.S.R. has asked share-
holders for a premium, and —no
question about it —it came as a
shock. The new capital
(£3,159,000, including premium)
is required because of the present
low purchasing-power of the £
and consequent heavy outlay on
erection and equipment of new
factories and enlargement of old
ones. The C.S.R. was interested
in the Courtaulds flotation last
year.
* * * *
For long-term holding, Cour-
taulds shares (paid to 55.) should
be worth attention at last week’s
quote of 6s. The co. has strong
interests behind it, and though
some years are likely to pass
before dividends come along,
the Courtaulds people know
their business.

Shareholders not prepared for
a long wait for dividends from
Metropolitan Cement might take
the present opportunity of
getting out at par. The scrip
sold at 20s. 6d. last week. Capi-
tal outlay has been far in excess
of prospectus estimates, and if
the limestone deposits are
acquired, as it is intended to do,
by April, 1951, it is unlikely that
the co.’s investment in the
cement undertaking and ancil-
laries, shares in other cos.,
intangibles, etc., will be much
under £1,600,000 for a 150,000-
ton-capacity organisation. And
lengthy teething troubles are the
usual thing in a newly-established
manufacturing concern.

f INDUSTRY
Australian secondary industry has
made remarkable progress in the past
ten years. The total number of
factories has increased by half; the
net value of industrial production is
almost three times as large; numerous
articles which previously had to be
imported are now made locally;
demand both at home and overseas
for Australian-made goods is high.
The Bank of New South Wales has
played, and will continue to play,
a valuable and stimulating part
t in fostering the great industrial
development of Australia.

Joseph Priestley, Yorkshireman, Doctor of Divinity,
theologian and pamphleteer, owes his fame to chemical dis-
coveries made in his leisure hours as a relaxation from writing
sermons and political broadsheets. His first success as a
practical chemist was the accidental discovery of soda water.
While living ne«t door to a brewery in Leeds, curiosity led
him to investigate the process of brewing. In doing so, he
found that carbon dioxide gas, which is produced during the
brewing of malt beverages, could be dissolved in ordinary
water to make “aerated water.” The success of this experi-
ment set him on his chemical career and he acquired a renown
which matched his considerable reputation as a theologian.
His appointment as librarian to Lord Shelburne at Bowood
in 1773 gave him ample time opportunity to develop his
scientific hobbies and his most important work was done
during the following eight years. In this period he discovered,
prepared and studied a vast number of gases —all of them
highly important—including oxygen, ammonia, nitrous oxide
(the “laughing gas” of the dentist’s surgery), hydrogen
sulphide, hydrogen chloride and sulphur dioxide. Priestley’s
inventive genius was of a type that is typically British. As
a practical experimenter he has had few,
if any, equals, and the gases he discovered
have proved of immense scientific and com-
mercial importance. He died in 1804 in
Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
There’s no disputing the fact
that the world is becoming a
warmer place to live in. Set-
ting aside man’s persistent con-
tribution to this troublesome
enough phenomenon, it is con-
soling to know that the climate
—here in the Gulf Stream, at any
rate —is improving. On the
average, winters are milder and
summers brighter than they
were. There are fewer great
frosts,' and Europe’s glaciers are
shrivelling year by year. So
that, in time, these islands may
expect to have a mild, equable
and reliable climate. But not yet.
Southern England had a
chastening shock when “the
green lap of the newcome
spring,” so far from being
strewn with violets, suffered
storm and gale and deep snow-
drifts. Branches of lilac and
cherry-trees, in full blossom,
snapped under the weight of
snow; fires burned all night in
orchards and failed to prevent
some damage to fruit crops.
Our multi-sweatered guests, the
West Indies cricketers, fought
their first practice match against
rough and chilly weather; and,
when the snows had melted, rain
came to mar the season’s official
opening.
The housewives’ revolt against
the high prices of fish and green
vegetables has no political im-
plications, notwithstanding the
Minister of Food’s assertion that
they have his backing. It may
be left to them to resist “the
reorganisation of marketing
under public ownership” as
firmly as they have refused to
pay exorbitant prices. What
happened was that when con-
trols were lifted from fish some
wholesalers tried to cash in and
make quick fortunes. The
scheme failed and, instead, the
merchants lost heavily.
Fresh vegetables are scarce
because of last year’s drought.
Shoppers can’t—and won’t —pay
extravagantly for them. If there
is any lesson at all, it is that the
housewife feels the stronger for
her partial emancipation. She
it is who wants to do the con-
trolling, by the money in her
purse, and not have to be
grudgingly thankful for what-
ever is handed to her across the
counter. Everybody will wish
her success.
The Budget
It seems commonplace to
reaffirm that Britons deserve a
better and more stable Parlia-
ment than they have at present.
A fair prophecy to make is that
Parliament will begin to func-
tion properly when those of its
members who are ill can be
excused attendance until they
have recovered, when ambu-
lances and “walking wounded”
are not to be seen within the
precincts of the House, and
when the Whips move out of
the limelight.
The striking thing about the-
Budget debate was not that the
Government won, but that their
majority (5) was so close to the
forecast of the previous day
(3). However great the need for
a truce or understanding between
the two main parties so that the
nation’s business may be carried
on, the Opposition and all other
anti-Socialist elements were
bound to contest the major
points of the Budget. The
further 9d. a gallon on petrol
(thus doubling the tax) is
intended to provide the money
to pay for slight tax reliefs. As
there are few motorists who use
their cars sojely for private pur-
poses, this tax must inevitably
increase business charges, thus
giving another upward jolt to the
cost of living. Purchase tax was
intended to be a temporary
device to cut down luxury spend-
ing, but has extended even to
household articles that are as
essential as the kitchen sink.
There doesn’t seem anything very
luxurious about a five-ton lorry.
The answer lies in the fact that
the railways are losing heavily
at the cost of the roads. Of
such is the nature of “planning.”
The Budget, needless to say,
has had a bad Press (the
“Times” editorially burst into
doleful alliteration.' “brooding
over the bleak and barren
budgetary scene....”); the
sharpest criticism is directed to
Sir Stafford Cripps’s refusal to
consider reduction of Govern-
ment expenditure.
—and after
The party struggle for a
decisive majority in the next
Government is taking shape.
While the result of a snap elec-
tion now would probably be
little different from the present
composition of the parties, much
may happen before the autumn
to sway the nation into compel-
ling decisions ; so that an appeal
to the country in October or
November might give a clear
majority.
Labor strategists are said to
be concerned over the prospect.
They know that the total Labor
vote and the huge majorities in
the industrial constituencies will
be repeated. But the recent elec-
tion has shown that this does
not give a true picture of seats
held. Which means that unless
the Labor party can expand its
influence into the rural districts
and small towns it has poor
hopes of a working majority.
The result of this is that Mr.
Aneurin Bevan, leader of the
diehard proletarians and sworn
enemy of the rest, has been
forced off-stage by Mr. Herbert
Morrison, who is all sweet and
cooing reasonableness and who
painstakingly avoids stepping far
to the left of centre.
The Tories are busy stock-
taking, and, in tidying-up their
shelves, they are careful to make
room for possible intakes. Were
their Parliamentary affairs con-
ducted solely under the director-
ship of Messrs. Eden, Butler and
Co. it is probable that the Gov-
ernment Whips would be less
harassed than they are. But the
leader of the Conservatives, as
the world knows, is no punch-
puller.
The strongest pointer yet to a
future overthrow of the Socialists
comes from the Upper House.
By joining the Conservative
party, the Liberal front-benchers,
Lords Reading and Rennell,
have established the firm be-
ginnings of a solid anti-Socialist
front. Lord Woolton has been
quick to seize his advantage, and
it is hard to see how the more
progressive realists among the
Liberals can hope to hold out
much longer. What might once
have been coalition would now
seem to be coalescence.
Fact or Fiction ?
Posterity can be a searching
critic where the lives of the great
are concerned. The debunking
age of Lytton Strachey and
others may have been a too-
violent reaction from the
squeamish repression of Vic-
torian biographers. Nowadays
better - balanced understanding
and fuller knowledge of the
science of psychology seem to
point to relevant fact-finding
rather than the extremes of
whitewashing or muck-raking.
Opposition to the publication of
what are considered to be
unsavory episodes usually comes
from the families of the
celebrity, and more than one
play or biography has been held
back for this reason,
A somewhat paradoxical situa-
tion has arisen over the Words-
worth centenary celebrations at
Grasmere, The poet’s well-
known love affair with Annette
Vallon was expunged from Mrs.
Joyce Cockcroft’s play “The
Wordsworths” by request of the
Wordsworth family. Meanwhile,
in London, Mr. William Words-
worth, another descendant, has
stated that he is working on a
film script dealing with this very
episode.

Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
The decorations for the Coral Sea Ball
in St. Kilda Town Hall were the capable
work of Alwyn Spicer, his wife and Pat
Lukies, and the tropical atmosphere was
captured to the life. Floating over the
ballroom was the haunting perfume of
frangipani and other tropical flowers.
The official enclosure was set with small
tables, each presided over by a host and
hostess. Federal president of the Aus-
tralian-American Association, R. G.
Casey, and his wife, who is president of
the women's group, received the vice-regal
party, Mrs. Casey wearing a full-skirted
gown of black slipper-satin and a match-
ing jacket. The bouffant gown of pale-
blue brocade worn by Lady Brooks was
made with a decollete neckline and with
tiny pearl buttons to the waistline.
Jeanette Brooks's picture gown was of
powder-blue brocade.
Filmy white nylon net was the choice
of Mrs. S. J. Fletcher, wife of the U.S.
Consul-General. The wife of Rear-
Admiral J. A. Collins was in dove-grey
chiffons. A long.*, spray of lime-green
orchids toned in with the emerald-green
satin gown of Mrs. Harold Rabling.
Mrs, W. W. Killough, president of the
American Women’s Auxiliary to the
Children’s Hospital, wore black slipper
satin. Organiser of the ball, Rhoda
Taylor, had her white chiffon full-skirted.
Mrs. lan Potter’s brocades were old-ivory.
Layers of pastel-pink tulle formed Mrs.
Frank Gillespie’s gown. Wanda Shilli-
day’s cream satin brocade gown had
trimmings of crystal beads. Her mother
was in black lace. The skirt of Mrs. Ken
Myer’s white linen gown was encrusted
with gold beads to match the bead trim-
ming on the strapless bodice. Gold em-
broidery embellished the bodice of Mrs.
Les Sangster’s black tulle. Mrs. Alwyn
Spicer’s white georgette ballerina frock
had igold accessories. Mrs. Ted Doyle
contrasted her black satin with turquoise-
blue velvet shoulder-straps.
Looking radiant and slightly overcome
at the warmth of the welcome given her,
Erna Berger raised her lovely voice with
the Victorian Symphony Orchestra in the
Town Hall with Henry Krips conducting.
The petite singer’s gown was of cham-
pagne lace mounted on tea-rose pink
taffeta. The skirt was bouffant, the
bodice fashioned with a Medici'
collar and long, tight-fitting sleeves.
Noted in the audience were Dorrie
O’Neill, her gown wide stripes of white
lace printed on black linen ; Mrs. Audrey
Elford,,hers of old-rose lace ; Rosalind
Martin, in amber shot taffetas ; and Mrs.
Gordon Byron Moore, in cherry-red
angora.
Melbourne’s Little Theatre will cele-
brate its 150th production on Saturday
next when the curtain goes up on
“Saloon Bar.” Players and their friends
have been working hard giving the theatre
a face-lift. Also in celebration of the
progress of the Little Theatre was the
Bal Masque at the Delphic. Black
domino, jewel-colored masks and balloons
added a touch of fantasy to the occasion.
At the official table was Mrs. Ken Bur-
gess, wife of the president of the Little
Theatre’s Players Club, in a gown of bur-
gundy crepe trimmed with crystal bugle-
beads. Mrs. Peter Whitehead rustled in
strawberry taffeta, as did Biddy Sewell in
translucent green with a skirt cut into
petals and showing a lime-green ruffled
tulle petticoat. Lois Murray matched the
bodice of her white tulle gown with a
shoulder-cape of powder-blue satin.
Marjorie Archibald’s bouffant red-shot
taffeta gown had a portrait neckline. A
black lace and sequin mask was worn by
Bettine Wiseman with her pale-lemon self-
patterned organdie. Dew-drop tulle in
midnight-blue was Margot Pettigrew’s
choice. Mrs. Hal Percy danced in shrimp-
pink tulle. Mrs. Philip Dare’s short
strapless evening gown was in elephant’s-
breath shot taffeta. Mrs. Maurice Copo-
lov’s gown of aqua-green satin had an off-
the-shoulder bodice. A white faille frock
with Medici collar and slim skirt made
neat effect for Rita da Silvaera.
“One Wild Oat,” which had its
premiere at the King’s Theatre, is an
entertaining play headed at times towards
slapstick. The audience obviously
loved it, and also their old favorites
Minnie Love and Lily Moore. Mrs.
John Heath was there in a bouffant
gown of black lace and tulle, Mrs.
S, B. Henderson wore a short ermine
jacket with her silver-grey brocades, Mrs.
Norman Watts’s powder-blue crepe gown
was splashed with crystal beads, Ruth
Morton wore wine-red under a full-length
fur coat. Mrs. G. Charlwood topped her
steel-grey frock with silver-foxes, Mrs.
Eric Cottrell’s blue-fox cape was worn
with parchment-toned satin. A little theatre
hat gave a perky touch to Mrs. Sam
Wells’s black ensemble, Mrs. Arthur
Howarth’s black lace frock was short,
her tiny black pearl-and-gold-trimmed
velvet cap gay with emerald-green
feathers.
At the civic reception given by the
Lord Mayor, Cr. J. S. Disney, and Mrs.
Disney to visiting Salvationists General
and Mfs. Orsborn at the Town Hall, the
Lady Mayoress wore a black jacket-suit
and a small black cap finished with a
black aigrette. Among the wives of
councillors were Mrs. F. P. Selleck in
parchment-toned felt hat and black coat
with a deep cape collar of black Persian-
larhb and Mrs. O. J. Nilsen, her jacket-
suit hyacinth-blue. Mrs. J. J. Booth was
with Archbishop Booth ; her clerical-grey
suit was worn with a navy, feather-
trimmed hat. Mrs. H. Wootton added
to her black suit a powder-blue grosgrain
hat. Mrs. J. J. Daly contrasted her black
coat with a garnet-red cloche hat. Pink
lined the lapels of Mrs. Isobel Green’s
frock.
A nippy wind brought out fur wraps
and snug suits to Flemington for the first
of the winter meetings. There was color
aplenty, and among the new shades
orchid-pink was an easy winner. Mrs. Eric
Avery’s coat was of this shade; her
matching hat was finished with plaited
ropes of the material falling across each
shoulder. Mrs. Ray Joseph combined
steel-grey wool coat and small hat of
grey and orchid-pink jersey. With her
beige gaberdine tailored suit Mrs. Con-
stance Day wore a platter-shaped brown
velvet hat finished with aigrettes. Mrs.
J. Newton’s brown velvet cap was
trimmed with a short upstanding brown
plume. With her black velvet coq-
trimmed hat Mrs. Norman Bush wore a
black slim-fitting coat with collar and
cuffs of black Persian-lamb. Mrs. H.
Armatruda covered her forest-green
wool crepe frock with a full-length
ermine coat; a gold aigrette trimmed her
brown hat. Judge Foster’s wife was in
ink-blue tweed, a turquoise-blue sweater
and an ink-blue felt hat. London-tan
accessories went with Ann Wilton’s beige
suit. Bettine Burgess’s frock and jacket
were in grey and brown striped wool;
her winter-white felt hat had brown and
white trimmings. A lime-green and clover
chevron tweed coat was «worn by Mrs.
John Ahlberg with a clover felt hat
banded with clover grosgrain ribbon.
This is the beguiling young Australian
comedienne, Babs MacKinnon, whose
act, “The Woman in His Room,” is one of
the high spots of the current Tivoli
presentation, “Where’s Charley?” Babs,
who is only 17, is the daughter of Mrs.
Irene MacKinnon and the late Douglas
MacKinnon, who were known in the
theatre as the Musical Macs. Most of
Bab’s life has been spent in the theatre,
and her education while on tour was
received from a private tutor. David and
Frank Martin regard her as highly promis-
ing. Photo by Harry Jay.
From Sydney
Tonight in the Town Hall, Sydney audi-
ences will laugh and sigh a little and
maybe grow a bit sentimental as the
Cavalcade of Song unrolls its glittering
pageant. The songs and the music go
’way back and throw a shadow forward
on what will be tomorrow’s choice. The
programme is of whirlwind variety. The
Police Military Band will be there ; there
are 500 in the cast. City choirs and
theatrical societies will breeze through
grand opera, musical comedy. There
will be bailet, too, and Joan Mitford is
coming from Maitland, and will sing the
fascinating “Habanera” and “Seguedelle”
from “Carmen.” Last year in the midst
of the blackouts the Cavalcade of Song
was a success; this year with the lights
on (here’s hoping) it should be a triumph.
The T.B. Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen’s
Association benefits.
Patricia Bartlett, Sydney mezzo-
soprano, is at present in England scoring
successes in a series of London recitals
directed by the British Arts Council.
Patricia is also featured on the 8.8. C.
Third Programme, and reports have
already reached friends here of her
crystal-clear singing in this programme of
Mozart’s “Idomeneo.” Last Saturday
night she was associate artist with Heddle
Nash in Leeds. Patricia, who had
plucked local laurels, left Sydney more
than a year ago to further her studies at
the Royal College of Music, London,
Her work with the famed Glyndeboume
Company and her experience at the
Edinburgh Festival have been of great
value to her. Photo by Robin, of London.
. The decorations of the Coral Sea Ball
(excepting the flags) are long since faded
to dust. But the memory it commemo-
rated will remain evergreen in Australian
hearts. It sometimes seems that a function
more imagination-stirring than a ball
might be arranged to impress the great-
ness of the day on the hurrying citizen.
However, the ball was a triumph—flags,
orchids, satins and laces. Before assem-
bling at Prince’s many of the guests had
been entertained at cocktails at the
Admiral Moore home in Elizabeth Bay.
Admiral Radford, Commander-in-Chief
of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and his wife
were the big guns of the evening. Mrs.
Radford has a very dignified air, and
rich gold brocades suited her style.
The Governor-General, Mr. McKell,
Mrs. McKell and daughter Betty were
at the ball, and their entry was dramatic
with the playing pf “God Save,” “The
Star Spangled Banner,” and the unfurling
of Australia’s and America’s flags.
President of the Australian-American
Association, Conrad Horley, and Mrs.
Horley, and Minister for External Affairs
Percy Spender and Mrs. Spender, re-
ceived the guests. Deep-blue taffetas, full
and bouffant, were worn by Mrs. Horley,
and Mrs. Spender’s frock was of black
tulle and lace. U.S. Naval Attache, Com-
mander Adrian Perry, and Mrs. Perry
came up from Melbourne for the ball,
Slimly-fitting silver lame gleamed in her
frock.
Promising to be one of the brightest
events of the season is the “Evening in
Buenos Aires” now being planned by an
energetic committee which includes the
newly-appointed Consul-General for the
Argentine, Mr. H- Fernandez Yayle, Mrs.
Fernandez Yayle and Mrs. C. Monjauze.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Interviewed in Sydney, The Mouth
/otherwise known as Joe E. Brown)
opened and betrayed the friendliest fel-
low imaginable, with a guiding prin-
ciple of humor from which he never
deviates —making fun against those with
physical or mental infirmities is out.
Serious-minded, like most funnymen off-
stage Joe E. first trod the boards at nine,
which gave him a sound training before
grinning into films. As well as putting on
scores of shows for troops in the late war,
he did as much broadcasting—once in
Canada, in half-an-hour’s broadcast fun-
ning with fellow-artists, he dragged in
116°million dollars for war purposes. He
naturally goes down well here, formality
fitting him about as badly as a muzzle.
M.L. puppeteer Raeburn Griffiths is in
Sydney to present to advertisers a puppet-
film which he made at Rushcutter Bay,
the first of its kind produced in Australia.
Back home in Maoriland he runs a
marionette theatre, with which he’s pro-
duced Shakspeare from Whangam in
the north to the Bluff in the south, again
a “first” for Australasia. In “The
Tempest” (rehearsed for 12 months and
presented 500 times), three operators jiggle
nine characters, which are all on-stage
at once in the last scene. Griffiths reckons
that working his minions (which he makes
himself), three at once, and speaking his
lines at the same time, in a two-hour show
leaves him about as fresh as a concert-
pianist finishing Beethoven’s 35-minute
Hammerclavier. A keen-faced 30-year-
old who enthusiastically believes in
puppets as a medium for serious theatre,
he has sent his film to the 8.8. C. and
America, with high and, in the opinion
of present writer, who has seen it, sound
hopes of cashing-in on television.
“M.”: If Joseph Nicholls is not the
best-known man in the Territory he
ought to be—all Territorians must, at
some time, have had dealings with the
holder of 26 official positions, ranging
from Clerk of the N.T, Supreme Court,
Sheriff of the Territory and Registrar of
the Prize Court (a delightful touch), to
Librarian, Rationing Officer, Clerk of the
N.T. Licensing Board and Registrar of
Births, Deaths and Marriages. He was
associate to Judge Wells when, a few,
years before the late war, Jap pearlers
appealed successfully against being de?
tained by the patrol service. A life-
member of the Darwin and Alice Springs
R.S.L., he has given a Nicholls Medal for
footballers in the former town and a
Nicholls Shield for those in the latter.
The call of the north took him from
Brighton (Vic.) to Darwin 25 years ago,
for a three-year term as police clerk ; he
celebrated his 25th anniversary behind a
paper-piled desk —possibly writing to
himself.
One of Westralia’s hardy overlanders,
Michael Patrick Durack is preparing for
a spell of nostalgia by back-tracking from
the Kimberleys to Cooper’s Creek, over
the route on which he and his brother
drove cattle in the early ’eighties. Durack,
an outsize pastoralist in the West, has
just completed one of the biggest property
sales in the State’s history—three huge
stations, Argyle in the N.T., and Auvergne
and Newry in the Kimberleys—to an
English syndicate for £260,000. He will
hang on to a small show in the Kimber-
ly 5 to maintain the family’s historic con-
nection with that region. Hailing from
Coulburn, and shifting to Queensland,
where his dad helped pioneer the Cooper’s
Geek district, he eventually took Horace
yreeley’s advice and sought new pastures
m the West. Now rising 86, still erect
and whipcord lean, he spends much, of
he year in the saddle, and hides a jovial
ace beneath a streaming white moustache
and full-pointed beard of Edward VII
es ign. He is on the executive of the
erth Pastoral Association, was M.L.A,
and is the father of writers and illustra-
tors Mary and Elizabeth Durack.
Third Maorilander to participate in

L. V. Bryant, a member of the Everest
expedition of 1935 when it reached
22,000 ft. up, and R. Scott Russell, who
climbed Karakorum in another assault in
the Himalayas. Packard was a student at
Canterbury College, Christchurch, M.L.,
and learnt his stock-handling in alpine
country round Canterbury and Westland.
Place of honor in the R.A.A.F. section
of the Coral Sea march in Melbourne
was taken by Wing-Commander D. W.
Kingwell, who headed the 32 Hudson
Squadron up north. It was a Catalina
and a Hudson which first spotted the
Jap invasion fleet, and it was Kingwell
who figured in one of the most dramatic
solo encounters in the squadron’s history.
Returning to base at Salamaua, he was
intercepted by five Zeros and fought a
running battle for 20 minutes, most of it
in full view of the ground staff and troops
stationed about the Jackson air-strip back
of Moresby.
After receiving a knighthood in the
Birthday honors, John Dudley Gibbs
Medley, Vice-chancellor of the Uni-
versity of Melbourne, went off to the
U.K. in time to collect an honorary
degree from Oxford. Although born
among its dreaming spires, the son of a
professor, and himself a graduate of New
College, he spent little of his time among
the cloisters. Five years’ service in the
1914 war, which earned him D.S.O. and
Bar, were followed by several years in
business in Australia. As his mother was
a Gibbs and both his grandmother and
his wife’s mother were members of the
Bright family, he naturally entered the
firm of Gibbs, Bright and Co., and
managed its offices in Adelaide, Mel-
bourne and Sydney before going back to
teaching and the study of the classics at
Tudor House, Moss Vale (N.S.W.). Mel-
bourne University, looking for a man
with organising as well as academic quali-
fications for its vice-chancellor, selected
him for the post, and in his 10 years
of office he had the big job of steering the
KNIGHT J. MEDLEY, out to grass.
University through the war years and of
battling with the enormous post-war prob-
lems, when personnel and students
more than doubled and the overflow had
to be accommodated at Mildura. He has
just had the uhgrateful job of closing
down the sub-branch and finding accom-
modation for a fresh influx of students
at a time when the rage for academic
education has reached the proportions of
an epidemic. Tall, with a great stoop
and a face like a kindly vulture, he isn’t
the type of the absent-minded professor,
though he looks it. He is credited with
having done a great job in “humanising”
the institution he is in charge of and
from which shortly he is to retire, at 60.
Judged here by Prior, Frank Walters
Kitto, the new High Court Judge, has
reached a peak of his profession at 47.
Schooled at North Sydney High, he took
his B.A. and LL.B. with first-class honors
in both, and, after brief experience of the
Law’s mechanical side in the N.S.W.
Crown Solicitor’s office, was called to the
Bar, in 1927, and within a few years,
practising on the Equity side, was already
a legal light. To a first-class
legal brain with an extraordinary
faculty for seizing on the real issue hidden
in a case, he adds the gift of practical
commonsense. K.C. at 39, and a fine

of the language, his reputation widened
and he became considered one of the
leading Constitutional lawyers at the Bar.
The Privy Council banking case, in which
he worked in close liaison with Barwick,
K.C., set the seal on his career. He was
born in Melbourne.
“King’s Pawn”; Winner of the Aus-
tralian Draughts Championship squared
out in Brisbane, Lloyd Fell, of Sydney,
is also a “ranked” chess playej* —which
means that he is classed among Aus-
tralia’s first 20. Players who are top-
rankers in both games are rarities—Fell
won a City of Sydney chess championship
on his first appearance in competitive
chess, and was a long-distance mover in
the latest radio chess-match between
Sydney and London.
“M.G.S.”: John Lanigan, the big,
robust tenor who made a real hit in
singing, operatic and dramatic circles in
Melbourne before he left for England,
to make an even greater hit there, has
seen fit to provide himself with a new
name for theatrical purposes—John
Levant. My dictionary gives “levant” as
the name of the eastern Mediterranean
and the coasts of Syria, Asia Minor and
Egypt; it is also the name of a silk fabric
and of an easterly gale that springs up in
those parts. And it can mean “to decamp
or abscond,” from the Spanish levantar.
Perhaps the young man thought that
Melba, Stralia, Austral and Mae Sydney
had used up all the possibilities of Aus-
tralian nomenclature, but it seems a
strange selection. Why not John Yarra-
yarra or John Eaglemont?—he comes
from Eaglemont-by-the-Yarra. He was a
munitions worker, later served in the
Army during the late war, then won a
“Sun” aria competition. He has been
snapped up by one of the leading opera
entrepreneurs in London, but while wait-
ing for the season is singing in the musical
comedy “Carissima,” and earning enco-
miums from the critics.
“J.E.M.” : Voiced his last orisons, the
Rev. James Robertson Maxwell Hall,
M.A., Rural Dean of St. Philip’s since
1935, member of the Queensland Anglican
Diocesan Council and Rural Dean for
South Brisbane, but long before that the
most popular padre in the State’s furthest
south-west, where he was head of the
Bush Brotherhood, headquartered first at
Charleville and later Cunnamulla. A
word in disparagement spoken of the
“Reverend Jimmie” would have bought a
fight in jackeroos’ quarters or shearing-
sheds along the Warrego or Bulloo in the
nineteen-twenties. The padre never
failed to turn out as rake for Cunna-
mvflk in the regular Sunday-aftemoon
fixtures. Also, he brought the choir with
him to the pictures after Evensong every
Sunday night Creed was no barrier to
entry to the kindly environment of the
Cunnamulla Rectory, where religion,
politics and sport were argued with gusto,
to the broadening of many an adolescent
mentality. He was heavyweight champion
of Queensland University in 1919, and
since 1940 Was R.A.A.F. padre at Green-
slopes Military Hospital.
An Old Australian comes back as a
migrant in Archdeacon Juss Barnett,
Rural Dean of Sherbourne, Dorset.
Headmaster of Caulfield Grammar in
1896, he went missionising in China,
founded Hong Kong University and then
settled in Dorset. With his wife, the
90-yea r-older proposes to live in the
Apple Island.
“Cauboy”: If Gertrude Johnson, the
indefatigable founder and honorary
director of the National Theatre Move-
ment, has her way, next year’s Federation
celebration will be signalised by an arts
festival in Melbourne comparable to the
Edinburgh Fes '.val. She is off by air to
Rome, Vienna, Salzburg and London to
look into the way such festivals are run
in those parts and to recruit Australian
artists like Robert Helpmann, John
Brownlee, John Lanigan and Sylvia
Fisher for the frenzy, which will com-
prise opera, ballet, drama, orchestral
concerts and chamber music. She is
assured of full financial backing, and she
has made such a remarkably good do of
the Movement’s previous seasons that
there is no reason to suppose she won’t
make as good a do of this one. W. P.
Carr, her producer on those occasions, is
already in England gaining experience in
the English theatre.
Going from Launceston to the deputy-
managership of E., S. and A. in S. Aus-
tralia, W. A. Lawrie has been with the
bank since 1914 ; his father, too, was in it,
managing at Mt. Gambier and Darwin.

At 55, in Brisbane, Frank Rogers, two-war
Digger and Queensland’s Deputy-Director of
Rationing. In War I lieutenant in the 7th
Battalion, one of the early wounded on
Gallipoli, in the second he was lieutenant-
colonel, camp commandant of the 2/24th
Training Battalion.
At 81, B. T. Pearse, Victorian headmaster
and for years a graceful paragraphist in The
Bulletin ; outback pars., mainly on the antics
of the country nippers he used to teach, pre-
sented with a rare sympathy and insight into
that barefooted breed. His calligraphy, like that
of most schoolies, is remembered in this office
for its neatness.
In Kent (Eng.), at 45, in an aircraft crash,
Wing-Commander H. G. N. Ramsbottom-
Isherwood, a Maorilander who studied for the
priesthood in Melbourne, changed his mind
and joined the R.A.F. in England in 1930. Fie
was the War II ace selected to command the
Hurricane wing sent to north Russia in 1941.
His wing comprised four Australians, two
Canadians, a Rhodesian and a further mixed
bag of English, Scotch, Irish and Welsh fliers.
At Geraldton (W.A.), at 78, Christopher
Rowan, who battled hard and successfully to
put lupin on the map as stock-feed in the
West. Forced by the depression of the late
’eighties from medicine at Melbourne Univer-
sity on to the land, he became manager of
Jimalong Station on the Lachlan. Shifting
west in 1910, he settled on Wooree Station, out
of Geraldton —here, president of the Victoria
(W.A.) Agricultural Society tyid of the district’s
Flour Milling Co. For eight years he was
sheep and wool adviser to the Transvaal
Government.
At 87, in Sydney, James Houston, blue-water
engineer who’d driven Mcllwraith McEacharn’s
ships for 31 years before he finally drew his
fires in 1927. Joining the firm in 1896 as
fourth engineer, his competence is measured by
the fact that within five years he had chief’s
rings up. Widely liked among coastal black-
gangs.
In Sydney, at 70, Lancelot de Mole, the
Australian engineer who, in 1912, living in
Perth, invented a military tank and submitted
its design to the British authorities. Recognition
came two years after the war, when the Court

was better than that which lunged into action
at Cambrai in 1916. The British Government
rewarded him with C.B.E. The original model
of his tank is in Canberra’s War Museum.
In Brisbane, Ralph Gore Sco(t, well and

THE UNFAIR
COW
By
E.O.SCHLUNKE
THE first thing Ingham showed me
when I went to visit him on the hill
dairyfarm he’d retired to after a
lifetime in the public service was his
cow. But what he talked about mostly
was his neighbor Reimer, who’d sold her
to him.
“One of nature’s gentlemen,” he said.
“Not like those smug, rich fellows on the
flats who want a hundred pounds an acre
for their farms, and who wouldn’t say
‘Hello’ to you unless you had a certificate
from your bank manager.”
It made me smile a bit to myself ; he’d
always been so suspicious of everybody
in his departmental days.
“Helped me no end to get settled here,”
he went on, as if his move, a mere eighty-
miles down the South Coast, had been a
truly epic business ; “brought all my odds
and ends of furniture from the station at
half the carrier’s price.”
Which didn’t seem such a noble service
when one considered that Reimer was
doing the trips in any case on his own
business. The fact seemed to be that
Ingham had made up his mind that every-
thing was wonderful in his new life ; all
sunshine and serenity and fresh, pure
milk. No inter-office “screamers” to
harass him ; no struggles and manoeuvres
to retain his seniority over younger and
cleverer men pushing up ; no half-hidden
smirks when he couldn’t make up his
mind about the correct procedure; and
no presumptuous hats or coats hanging
on his peg if he happened to come to the
office a bit late.
HIS cow Judy typified everything that
was good. She was a very quiet cow,
so quiet that Ingham could go up to her
and pat her where she lay in her pasture,
ruminating over the grass she had eaten,
and Getting in tardy motion those glands
and organs which she employed to pro-
duce her niggardly two-and-a-half quarts
of milk. Ingham thought she was
wonderful. Then one evening she became
ill.
At first Ingham thought it was just her
vaunted “quietness,” but when she
refused to stand up, no matter how much
he urged and cajoled her, he had to
believe it at last. He stood there, baffled by
his inexperience, with a helpless look on
his face, and I couldn’t help thinking how
much he was missing the various helpful
secretaries he’d leaned on so hard in the
last few years.
The cow had chosen an exposed
hillock to lie on, and we hadn’t been
encouraging her very long before a slim,
dark, young fellow came loping across the
slopes in the characteristic rubber knee-
boots of the dairy hand. It was Reimer’s
man; and immediately Ingham began to
look less hopeless. The boy was con-
cerned at the state of the cow.
“Better go and tell the boss,” he said,
and off he went with Ingham’s blessing.
“Reimer will fix her up,” Ingham
assured me. “He’s a wonderful man with
cows.”
I looked for Reimer’s coming with con-
siderable interest. My private opinion of
the cow’s trouble was that it was mainly
senile decay, and I wanted to see how his
reputation would come out of this.
Presently we saw Reimer striding down
the winding road, so bow-legged that his
knee-boots gaped at every stride; a
gnomish little fellow with wide cheek-
bones, pointed chin and lively but very
crafty grey eyes. He had a box of rather
tarnished veterinary instruments under
his arm. With him was another dairy-
farmer, a venerable old man he called
Bob, and following behind was the dairy-
hand with another young fellow, a
soldier-settler who’d been a prisoner, A
sick cow, apparently, was everybody’s
concern.
THE two older men fixed their eyes on
the cow as they approached and
hardly regarded us at all. They had a
close look at both ends and the udder;
they prodded her here and there and
pondered deeply while the rest of us
watched. After about five minutes’ think-
ing the old man said, “It might be milk-
fever.” But Reimer kept a very non-
committal expression on his face.
“She’s got a wet muzzle,” he said.
He told us to stand her up so that he
could have a better look, so we got hold
of various parts of her, heaved her up,
and held her when she swayed.
“She’s weak,” said Ingham, beginning
to fret, though he knew that was bad for
his ulcer.
Reimer turned a tolerant look on him;
after all it was Ingham’s cow, so he was
entitled to make remarks about her, how-
ever unqualified he might be.
“Fever soon makes them weak,” he
said} and I could see how neatly he
would escape if Ingham could be con-
vinced that she had contracted some fatal
illness.
He went and had another look at her
muzzle, and he said in a rather aggrieved
way, as if he suspected that the cow was
trying to deceive him by having contra-
dictory symptoms, “She’s got a wet
muzzle.” *
And the old fellow. Bob, repeated it,
solemnly and significantly as if he’d
forgotten about the previous inspection.
Reimer stripped at the teats and a small
quantity of watery stuff came away. The
udder was hard, too. He nodded his head
this way and that, still in command of
the situation, but obviously weighing far-
reaching consequences.
“It might be milk-fever,” he said, still
most noncommittally; and he picked up
the box of instruments and looked at
Ingham. “I could pump her udder, if you
like.”
It looked like the lowest kind of
duplicity, trying to put the responsibility
on the man who knew least. I glanced
round at the others to see what they were
thinking, and saw that the
was becoming aggressive ned man
“We ought to get her into a J
place, he said, “out of this • tered

Renner seemed to have done a lot of
thinking on the way, if the pinched and
sombre expression on his face meant
anything, and as soon as we had he
snug he started to haul out his instn,
ments. But the young fellow' Elliot took
one look at them and burst out laughing
m the frank way many soldiers had
acquired.
‘That’s the outfit old Noah had in the
Ark, isn’t it?” he inquired with mock
seriousness.
Reimer disregarded him for a presump-
tuous upstart and went on frowninglv
fitting his pieces together.
“What she really needs,” Elliot turned
to Ingham as a man of enlightenment and
progress, “is a shot of penicillin, just like
the doctor would give you if you were in
a feverish condition.”
Ingham was impressed, so much that he
surveyed Reimer’s preparations with
some doubt; but he didn’t feel sure
enough of himself to check the fiery little
man. Reimer, however, acted as if by
the mere change of his facial expression
Ingham had grossly insulted him.
“If you don’t want me to treat her,” he
snapped, “I’ll go home. But mind you,
I’m not answerable for the consequence!”
The “consequence,” ‘lngham could
readily gather, was to be the sudden,
irrevocable death of his cow. He
hesitated again, on the other leg, as it
were. ' '
Just then the cow gave a dreadful
moan and collapsed. It lay on its side,
legs and neck limp on the ground, with
flecks of foam coming out of its mouth.
A brief but startled look of consternation
flashed over Reimer’s face, but he said
nothing while young Elliot shouted,
greatly excited. “Penicillin! Only
penicillin can save her now!”
And Ingham, all alarmed and flustered,
cried out:
“Yes, quickly, get your penicillin before
she dies.”
And Elliot rushed away like the wind.
WHEN I looked at Reimer he was
packing his instruments into their
box again, which he shut with an angry
snap.
“All right,” he said to Ingham in a
sulky voice. “Let her have his penicillin,
but remember what I said.”
Ingham, with haggard face, looked
after him as he strode away, thinking, no
doubt, that now he was going to lose
both his cow and his friend. I thought,
however, that Reimer’s steps were really
quite jaunty, and the unworthy thoug
came into my mind that he was
with the way things were going: it tn
cow died it would be Elliot’s fault, and i
it recovered he would be cleared
suspicion. . A rt.
Elliot was back in a few minutes,
looked rather perturbed at how the co
condition had deteriorated, but when

Because ! saw upon the dark
tide the Bowsprit-pointed barque,
all her masts and spars bared, glide
swan-like past the harbor side,
into my mind there comes again
that red-purple gibber plain
rimmed at the parrot-blue of night

I journey in that region, there
the black swans sail upon Lake Eyre.
I waken on a plain that lies
past Camooweal and hear the cries
of brolgas on the cold air borne

MOFFAT HEADLAND.
This was a morning in summer, and
the dfoning beat
Of cicadas low in the bottlebrush
burdened the air
With a viscous sweetness, cloying the
listener’s heart.
The bush was a hazy mural, far off and
yet near.
Coming on to the Headland, out of the
bush,
One felt like the hoary old sundowner
called to a bar—
A foaming beer before him, and a lush
Blond barmaid to whisper nonchalantly
into his ear.
Louder the sea-noise below us as we
stopped
On the brink of the precipice. Stopped
by the uprush of air,
Our immediate breathing, also, as
blindly we topped
The Headland jutting immaculate there.
We were two wise young people.
Sweet, this encounter.
After sick passionate bush. The swift
embrace
Of the cool wind from the ocean,
brought like banter
A keener light to the eye, fresh blood
to the face.
Glorious blue and gold of ocean and
cloud:
Strung, like a rich woman’s necklace,
the glittering beach:
Seascape and landscape below us, made
us the proud
Surveyors of all heart felt and the eyes
could reach.
Yet, at our feet, sensed suddenly, a
wooden cross,
Crude, as mere boys might fashion to
foster a hoax.
Hung on our vision, held us at a loss—
A second steep declension, and one to
tax.
A man on the verge of departure into
a dream
Of seascape and landscape, finding his
foot on a grave
This, marked with a year and a name;
the usual theme
Of burial—grim relics men struggle to
\save.
“Queen of the Colonies,” here, in the
Eighteen Hundreds;
Husband and wife brought ashore, and
buried together
After the burial party, in landing,
blundered.
Trapped by the surf and not by stormy
weather,
Lost the grieved husband, the wife
having died at sea.
That was the history, briefly; and
wintry enough
To be told on a sunny morning: yet,
curiously,
Lending an air of mastery to the bluff.

SUNDRY SHOWS
A New Concerto.
With the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra under Eugene Goos-
sens, the young New Zealander,
Colin Horsley, was soloist in the
first Australian performance of
the Piano Concerto by Lennox
Berkeley, the contemporary'Eng-
lish composer. It can be said at
once that this is the best work
of its kind that has appeared
for some years. It is well con-
structed, logical in its develop-
ment, with no loose ends left
dangling around, and if it is of
no great melodic invention it is
at least pleasantly harmonious.
Colin Horsley played it with
great gusto and an obvious
enjoyment.
There must have been many
sighs of relief at the programme
announcement that non-arrival
of score-parts made cancellation
of a Bartok “work” necessary.
The substituted Delius, a pure
evocation of nature, found the
orchestra at its top, the peak
being reached in the second
movement with some beautiful
singing by the upper string choir.
Three Fanfares, the final one
by Goossens himself not the
least in merit, were attractive,
that by the American composer
Aaron Copland bringing from
trumpeter John Robertson some
splendid playing.
"Mrs. Warren's
Profession."
A somewhat rough-and-tumble
production by the Melbourne
National Theatre didn’t prevent
this early effort of the nona-
genarian playwright from mak-
ing an impact on an audience of
1950 people. It sat silent
throughout the proceedings as if
overawed at these 60-year-old
revelations of a 19th-century
social system.
Pat Cosgrove, as Vivie
Warren, the girl who is being
brought up as a young lady on
the proceeds of an international
brothel business conducted by
her mother, spoke her most
pregnant lines with the imper-
sonality of a textbook. Henry
Heydeman ’learnt of his future
mother-in-law’s profession with-
out displaying. more emotion
than if he had been told that
she was suffering from a gum-
boil.
But Norman Foote, as the
ineffable Sir George Crofts,
pimp and pandar, looked and
behaved like a thoroughly
decadent old boy, and Miss
Phyllis Wilson, unlike sundry
celebrated actresses of the past,
made Mrs, Warren a blithered,
bewildered and silly woman in
a horrible predicament who
aroused sympathy rather than
reprobation. The production
was by Moira Carleton.

thereby demonstrated that in
many respects this work is
superior to the more famous B
Flat Minor. The robust, rhyth-

"One Wild Oat."
Melbourne is now splitting its
sides at “One Wild Oat” (King’s
Theatre), a wild and \yoolly busi-
ness whose mainstay is Arthur
Rigby, as a sentimental tough
guy who hides a heart of gold
behind a shifting fa?ade of
ferocious scowls, grins and
grimaces. Where Silvaine’s
piece isn’t thinly-disguised
vaudeville it is in essence the
sort of simple farce favored by
amateur suburban companies in
the ’nineties, with an under-
current of modern sophistication
in the matter of matrimonial
relations.
Mr. Rigby makes his points
with the punch of a professional
boxer and in a voice like a
steam calliope, and Malcolm
Phillips, as a solicitor with a
family of precocious adolescents,
makes his in a parsonical bleat
which is more amusing at its
first surprising appearance than
at the finish,
Tramp-Vamp.
Clifford Mollison’s pro-
duction of “The Girl Who
Couldn’t Quite” at the Palace
Theatre, Sydney, began as a
comfortable drawing - room
comedy, Grandma Taylor
(Barbara Brandon) looking out
frequently through the French
windows of her mansion over
her broad acres of garden, and
chitchatting with country-
doctor Paul Evans (Michael
Duffield) and philanthropic
squire Sir John Oxley (Reginald
Wykeham), about grand-
daughter Ruth (Avril Wheatley),
who lives in a mood and never
laughs.
So when Ruth enters, we are
prepared for her, marching
about the stage and standing to
attention like an Awa, break-
ing vases and being rude very
amusingly ; and when she stands
at the window and laughs, and
they send out for the man she
was laughing at and haul in
Mollison—well, we are prepared
for that, too.
At this point we may wonder
why so pleasant a young lady
as Miss Wheatley should have
been brought all the way out
from London to go drilling and
shrilling about the stage, a job
any young Australian amateur
could do almost without think-
ing ; and at this point Miss
Wheatley turns on the acting,
and, with Mr. Mollison support-
ing as amateur psychologist,
drags out of the sewer of % the
past her disgusting old nurse *and
those practices which are re-
sponsible for her unnatural
gravity.
Wherefore it becomes obvious
that Miss Wheatley has not
needlessly visited us; but in an
inferior vehicle.
Flowerpieces and landscapes
(mostly of English scenes) by
Irene Hilton at Freeman's
Galleries, Sydney, fail to rise in
general beyond the standard of
well-meaning amateurism ; but a
“Mixed Bunch” (No. 20) has its
tulips combined in a pleasant
arrangement of blues and greens
and yellows, and “The Floating
Bowl,” in which the artist says
she has experimented with a new
medium which she prefers to
keep secret, is surprisingly vivid
and decorative. The effect is
rather like that of bright oil-
paint laid on wood.

Wagner’s sense of theatre,
lighting and dramatic effect does
not reduce at all satisfactorily to
concert-stage presentation, and
in the performance of “Tann-

Tim the Tramp (Clifford
and the Queensland Symphony
Orchestra the choir had many
long pauses to sit out.
Of the four soloists William
Herbert was unimpeded by the
use of manuscripts, and sang
with intelligence and beautiful
tone, and James Wilson sang
“O 'Star of Eve” splendidly, but
Strella Wilson was not at her

Danish composer who studied
under Berlioz and Von Billow,
went to America and died in
Denmark at the age of 80. It
seemed to contain echoes of the

The concert given at Sydney
Conservatorium by the N.S.W.
Youth Symphony Orchestra and

young choristers and players
under Carl Sauer’s spirited direc-
tion, had painstaking rehearsal
and, for the most part, had
much merit, though wood-
winds and brasses generally
need strengthening. The choir
was at its best in Bach’s “Jesu,
Fount of Joy,” Wheeler’s “The
Singers” and in the Dvorak
Largo.


ST ANTHONY
By
BRIAN JAMES
WHEN anything of value and
importance was lost, irretrievably
lost as if some malign spirit had
hidden it way. Mother used to
say: “Say a little prayer to St. Anthony,
and you’ll find it.”
There was a touching faith in this that
defied all the reasoning of the scoffer and
the unworthy. How St. Anthony did it
we never learned of course —whether he
just led the searcher to the lost article, or
whether he actually carried it in the way
of easy finding. But the fact remained
—he did help. Seldom did he fail, and
then it was the fault of the prayers ; they
were not fervent, or the “intention” was
insufficient.
Once Mother had lost her locket-
brooch, a massive ornament in twisted
and cunningly wrought gold. A thing to
be worn only on grand occasions—
church and visitings and visitors, when
one dressed up properly. There was no
telling where the brooch had been lost.
We had been to the Mission in town —
two redemptorists had seared our souls
with hell in anticipation and certainty,
with the only consolation to the juvenile
mind that it wouldn’t happen for a long
time yet. The brooch was gone when we
got home.
Beside the imminence of the flames
perhaps the loss of a brooch, a worldly
vanity of vanities, should have been a
small matter. But Mother grieved over it,
softly grieved with inner hurt, for the
locket contained a very small photograph
of Father; just the face ;as he was at the
time of his marriage. But it was more
than a mere photo ; it was the very em-
balming of memories and dreams, the
idealisation of earthly romance. Mother’s
own girlhood was in a way in that locket,
caught and fixed there for ever.
It was hard for us to think of Mother
as a girl—she was so hardly used by life,
prematurely aged, harsh and hard at
times, we thought; a bit craggy. Father
had died when we were very young ; six
of us there were ; and Mother had set to
on the stony farm and worked like a man
—harder than most men really. The
locket, or its contents, had pre-dated all
this struggle—“ There was a time, there
was a time,” it sang in its own way—a
time, a moment in the vast eternity, and
the locket held it ~ .
BUT the locket was lost, and could
be found nowhere.
“I had it on,” said Mother, “when we
left the church. And I had it on when we
got to McDermott’s yard”—where the
country folk left their traps—“and I
think I had it on when we got into the
buggy.”
“You only think!” said Ellen im-
patiently. Ellen was the oldest, just on
nineteen then. A fine girl, even if she was
our sister, but a trifle hard to put up with.
Mother was wonderfully tolerant with
Ellen, much more so than with the rest
of us.
“I’m almost sure, Ellen.”
“Then it must be in the buggy—it could
hardly jump out without our noticing it.”
“But is not in the buggy. We’ve looked
and looked.”
“Well, it’s lost then.” Ellen said this as
if it could never be recovered.
Here indeed was a case for St. Anthony,
an excellent chance to show what he
could really do. Mother didn’t say that,
or even think it. She said, “We’ll all say
a little prayer to St. Anthony,”
The search continued, for that was
necessary, too —St. Anthony, it seemed,
made a special point of not doing every-
thing himself.
It was Tom who found the locket. I
can still hear his shout, “Here it is!”
And Tom came running back from the
buggy.
“Where was it, Tom?”
“Right on the seat of the buggy—right
in the middle of the seat!” Tom was
excited about it.
“But I looked and looked everywhere
in the buggy,” said Ellen.
“So did I,” said Mother.
“And there it was, as plain as plain
could be!” said Tom.
“There can be no doubt at all as to
who put it there,” Mother said. “Now a
little prayer to thank St. Anthony.”
Mother was very pleased, and promised
to put something in the poor-box next
Sunday.
I think Tom was most impressed of
all. Tom was fifteen then, but he had
been a man as long as we younger ones
could remember. In fact, I don’t think
Tom had ever been a boy. A quiet,
serious fellow, almost stolid at times, but
he had a smile, too, that it did one good
to see. Very good and kindly he was to
usi in his earnest way, and I do think he
was the best man I have ever known.
Tom was only eleven when Father died,
and at once he stepped into manhood and
responsibility.
WELL, the finding of that locket was
a big event, and Mother said that it
just went to show. The younger members
of the family went into emotional re-
joicing and had to be told to keep quiet.
Their riotous joy seemed lacking in rever-
ence.
In it all, though, Georgie seemed
specially privileged. A quick, bright, lively
fellow was Georgie, and even we thought
him a beautiful child. A bit spoilt, too,
perhaps. Certainly Ellen had helped to
spoil him, though now she was trying to
undo her part in it, and even re-
commended a good hard smack. “He
wants it, mother, really and truly he does,
and it will save a lot of trouble later on.”
But it was seldom Mother ever brought
herself to smack Georgie, for Georgie
was in a class by himself, as it were.
Something of sentimental value to him
like the brooch, only a lot more so. For
Georgie was not yet born when Father
died—Father was dead four months when
Georgie arrived. He was never George:
at first it mostly went Little Georgie
and now at four it was just Georgie.
What would be done about his name
when he grew up a bit more, we didn’t
think of.
Georgie shook, his head in quick half-
circles, as he had a habit of doing, and
all his curls went into a wild kind of
fairy-dance. “Good old Antiny—he
found Mummy’s brooch,” he sang. He
had lovely hair in curls, it was, of light
gold. It had never been cut, and Ellen
made those curls her special care. She
loved doing Georgie’s hair, tending each
curl of it, winding them round her finger,
standing back now and then to get the
effect. Sometimes she told him sharply
to stand still, and that he was a naughty
boy, for Georgie was often wilful and
mostly unpredictable .. .
IT was in November sometime, weeks
and months after the finding of
Mother’s locket. I am not too sure just
how long. It was a good season, as every-
one said, or nearly everyone, for there
were some who must always be grum-
bling, and no season could ever be just
right for them.
Never had we seen the flats so green,
and even on the hill-slopes right up to
the timber it was green too, and not a
touch yet of the yellows and browns of
summer that were usually the colors long
before November had given out. In the
gully there was a small clear stream of
water that slis over the sand and gurgled
in the gravel and boulders. The gully
seldom ran at all, except in a wild tawny
flood after heavy rain, and at most for a
for a day or two after, dwindling
down rapidly to nothing at all. But now
there was this happy-looking stream, tell-
ing us it was there in its own right and
that it intended to run on for ever. And
on it went, right down to the creek, which
ran full, clear and strong among its oaks
and willows.
The gully and its flats was a place of
mystery and danger. It was an old gold-
diggings, long ago deserted, except for a
few withered relics who clung to the
place and their last bright hope. There
were shafts everywhere—hundreds and
hundreds pf them in varying stages of
decay. Some were great unsightly funnels
where the earth had caved in ; others were
neat dark oblongs, traps for the unwary,
thrillingly deep when stones were thrown
in—long and magnified seconds to wait
for the plonk of water or thud of clay.
And lower down were the biggest shafts
of all, often timbered and slabbed still,
where the lead had deepened and many a
vain attempt had been made to beat the
water. The water had never been beaten
down there, and the gold there was
fabulously rich, it was said. No one else
would ever beat that water —only the old
relics would ever do that, for they all had
their sure ways of doing it —some day
soon. Some day.
Mother and Tom had fenced off our
part of the gully—Sailor’s Gully it had
been in the great days. It was too
dangerous for stock. Many a cow had
fallen down the diggers’ holes, as we
called them, and horses, too, especially
frisky spring-time colts and fillies. Some-
times grass grew right up to the edge of a
shaft, even hanging down over the lips of
it and almost Hiding it. Men had fallen
down these holes, too. At least two men
had, long ago now. One had not been
found for weeks, and a grim story that
made.
The gully, then, was out of bounds for
the younger children.
I N those days before foxes, we kept a
1 small flock of turkeys, fine big bronze-
wings, lorded over by a magnificent
gobbler named Tim. Half his time, Ido
believe, Tim spent in stately strutting, tail
like a gigantic full-spread fan, and wing-
tips scoring the ground. Except for the
color, he was more like some fine old
galleon in full sail. Never a turkey could
gobble like Tim ; any sound at all seemed
sufficient to excite him to gobbling. We
would whistle at him and off he’d go into
a whole series of gobbles. His less-
demonstrative wives would cluck-cluck in
the way of turkey-hens, and feel proud,
no doubt, at having such a lord and
master as Tim.
Apart from adornment the turkeys
were not very profitable. Mother would
sell some occasionally to folk in town—
we never ate them ourselvesr—but their
eggs were hard to find, for the turkeys
ranged far and wide, sometimes being
gone for whole days at a time, camping
out at nights. They laid away, of course,
for they scorned any nests we might make
for them. Down the gully was their
favorite nesting, in the thick clumps of
briar-bushes, yellow-box suckers, or
dense patches of Chinese burrs, A
turkey’s nest was a regular treasure-trove,
but as likely as not the hen was already
broody arid sitting on the eggs. If it
happened to be old Sal —Tim’s favorite
wife —Tim would go broody himself and
help to bring out the clutch. Tim took
his paternity very seriously, and he was a
wonderful father—no turkey-hen ever
looked after chickens as well as Tim did,
or snuggled them under his wings so
lovingly at night. TT . M
Turkeys fascinated Georgie. He should
really have been scared of turkeys, for
when Georgie was little more than a
year old, a huge gobbler had savage y
assaulted him, knocking him over and
cuffing him. Mother hud r^
Georgie before he was badly hurt, a
that gobbler forthwith became Hms
immediate predecessor. Georgie w
wearing a red woollen coat or lump
the time, and that was supposed to hav
provoked the attack. But it was not hew
to be sufficient excuse for the mten
murder. . ,
Tim was different. Vain he m#t be,
spending altogether too much of his t
in showing-off, but his strong F'
instincts would seem to have soft : d
fiercer sides of his nature. Any .
the turkeys were about the house, 8
would follow them round and round,
incite Tim to gobble. Tim
obliging that way.

enough —the soft languid heat of early
summer.
The turkeys drifted through the home
addock, cluck-cluck, with Tim in all his
majesty of full sail and frequent gobbling.
Ellen heard the gobbling, without special
notice, hearing it vividly later on as a
memory. Georgie, too, was talking to the
turkeys as he always was.
“Georgie!” called Ellen at last, in her
best tones of second mother. No response.
She called again. But there was no
Georgie under the pepper-tree. Ellen
frowned. Georgie was disobedient, and
some reprimand was needed. She called
from the door in harder tones. And still
no reply. Her voice shrilled into
“Georg —ee!” long and short like, the
song of the coach-whip bird,
ELLEN was somewhat alarmed, but
her thought ran mostly to punish-
ment for Georgie’s naughtiness. On two
counts: wandering off, and not answer-
ing.
She went to the front of the house.
“Georg —ee! ” And she stood and listened
anxiously. Only faint echo came back
from the high ridge beyond the gully.
And the air was still again—with that
summer stillness that is so full of unnoted
sounds. “Georg—ee! Georg—ee!
Georgee!” Faster, louder, shriller, and

, to this slim hope, Ellen ran up
the rocky track that led to the up-the-

ot level ground among the ridges. It was
nearly half-a-mile from the house.
The three were at work on the new-
turned, dark-red soil. Clearly their only
concern was the job they were sharing—
Torn was running out the drill furrows.

headland. But she tried to be calm. “Is
Georgie with you?”
K/T OTHER understood at once. She
dropped her bag of grain and ran
to Ellen, Ihe boys, slower in realisation,
stopped their horses and stood wonder-
ing. Then they knew something was
amiss, and they ran too.
Mother was comforting Ellen—not a
word against her remissness. Ellen was
breaking down badly. Mother didn’t
break down. She was quick and practical
Barney was to look after the horses and
let them go ; and then follow as fast as
he could. Mother, Tom and Ellen
hurried home—Tom in the lead.
Ellen knew now that Georgie was dead
—and that Mother knew it. Before it had
been fear —but the fear went away with
hope. There was no more hope. “I did
watch him,” she cried. “I did watch him,
and he was gone in a minute. One minute
he was there, and the next he was gone.
The turkeys!”
“ There, there! ” said Mother. “We’ll
find him sure enough. He’s gone a little
further than you think.”
The unintended ambiguity was a blow
to Ellen. And for the first time in her life
she realised that real grief, the acute im-
personal sorrow, can only come with the
wisdom of the years.
The gully looked the same, but in-
expressibly forbidding too. The turkeys
were gone, and the midday quiet pressed
down like a weight upon the scene. Cal-
ling out was useless, and they knew it was,
but they kept calling. There was only
one place where Georgie could be, and it
was fearful to think of finding that
place ...
"THE neighbors were alarmed, and a
1 small crowd of men and some of their
womenfolk gathered round. There was
much peering into shafts, for all the good
it was, for the shafts ran quickly down to
solid darkness. Something more practical
was organised in the way of ropes and
candles and hurricane-lamps. But the
shafts were legion—no one had ever
realised hov/ many there were. Sailor’s
Gully had been a rich patch of gold. And
gold was having its evil due, even when it
was no longer there to exact it.
Mother said to Ellen, “You go up to
the house and make a big lot of tea.
Barney can help you to bring it down,
A bucket of it.”
It was good to give Ellen something to
do.
One of the relics hobbled along from
his mud-tin-and-bag mansion. Old
Looee Slade —the “Dirty Looee” of a
hundred childish pranks and stories.
Looee was one of the hopefuls who were
going to beat the water yet. Looee
steadied his weak blue eyes and spoke
from his few remembered experiences.
“Won’t float,” said Looee, “for days
and days. You’ll see!”
Looee wasn’t particularly upset about
it —it was just an established truth of
drowning.
“Then they floats,” continued Looee,
“face down.”
Looee’s revived importance derived
from his finding that man long ago—he
who had taken a few weeks to find . . ,
“Then,” said Looee in a cracked-up
kind of cunning, “the flies is a great help
in finding them.” In no way could
Looee be viewed as a cheerful help.
Someone in his charity induced Looee to
go back to his hut.
JINNY and I came home from school
to find this searching for Georgie.
We and the other children that came our
way to school joined in. That half-a-
dozen other children didn’t fall down
shafts must be attributed to a miracle.
Warnings were plentiful enough, but
mostly wasted.
Two mounted police and “Snowy” the
blacktracker came out from town. Some-
one had sent for them. They weren’t
much use —not in a search of this kind ;
and whatever Snowy’s powers in tracking
there was little enough scope for them
here. A wide area had been gone over,
but there could be no certainty that the
search was effective. Most of the deep
shafts had water in a season like this.
There might be, horrible thought, some-
thing in Looee’s theories after all.
Tom in his quiet way was as much a
“ You'll have to excuse him; he's painfully shy."
man as any of them there. I was very
proud of Tom. And I am ashamed, too,
to say that I was a little proud of myself
—the very immensity of this tragedy was
a cause of pride. My real affection for
Georgie was a thing apart altogether
from this. That was real and strong
enough, and so was the hope that Georgie
would be found alive and well. Some of
the women, Mrs. Cox and Mrs. Rimmer
among them I remember most distinctly,
hushed their voices when I came near
them. But I knew what that meant, and
it gave me a new importance in my own
eyes.
Then Jinny and I went and had a good
heartbreaking cry. Jinny was six and I
was eight at the time.
When I think back now I am quite sure
that Mother was far calmer than any of
those women. They fussed a deal over
her and tried to get her to go home. “Get
her home, Tom,” they said, “before”
But Tom knew better and didn’t try to
get Mother to go home. They tried, too,
to console Mother with a balanced and
blended mixture of hope for the best and
grief for the worst. They meant well.
It was more than five hours now since
Georgie’s disappearance. The sun was
sinking. Tim and his harem were thread-
ing a way homeward, making a wide
detour in doing so, to avoid the searchers
perhaps. Men looked at the sun and
looked at each other as to say—“lt’s
hopeless. He’s a goner,”
But they kept on, too, going over again
shafts they had previously examined.
'They tried a variety of dragging gear ;
big hooks mostly, heavily weighted, and
fish-hooks in this grim fishing. But no
results, except some horrible false alarms.
Ellen took it hardest of all. Added to
her, grief was the guilt of blame. Noth-
ing could take that from her.
“You mustn’t, Ellen,”* said Mother.
“You couldn’t help it, Ellen.”
And Ellen only wished she had been
drowned instead. I think a new respect
for Ellen came to us in that hour.
THEN Barney came forward. A simple,
good-natured fellow was Barney
whom we never credited with much sense,
and we always felt that with a screw or
two loosened he would have been the
silly one. Barney wasn’t his proper name
either —it was Arthur. But we always
called him Barney—the name seemed to
fit naturally, and it was a silly sort of
name, anyhow. Barney had big grey
eyes and his face otherwise was mainly
grin. You could tell Barney anything
and he’d believe it. Youi could put any-
thing over him and he’d never get upset.
It used to upset Tom a lot more than it
did Barney.
Barney for once was really serious, and
an idea was turning itself over in his
mind. He said to Mother: “Have you
said a prayer to St. Anthony?”
Even in her great distress Ellen was
shocked. “Oh, Barney! How could
you?”
The feeling, of course, was that St.
Anthony was very efficient in the matter
of brooches, scissors, thimbles—and the
screw-wrench that time. But lost
children were out of his line. He didn’t
go in for such things, and he wasn’t up
to it. No, it wasn’t quite right. Not
quite etiquette.
But Barney said, “Why not? I’m going
to try, anyway.”
And really now, when one thought of it,
it couldn’t do any harm.
“One Our Father and three Hail
Marys then,” agreed Mother, It sounded
like a recipe , , .
It might have been St. Anthony himself
—only that the voice was a trifle rough
and croaky for a saint —but someone
called out, “He’s down here! I heard
him! ”
There was a rush to a shaft some dis-
tance up the slope. An isolated shaft
with a small heap of mullock. Here the
sinking had been shallow, and that shaft
was no more than twelve or fifteen feet.
A rank duffer probably in the old days,
seeing that it was all by itself.
But a feeble and intermittent wail was
coming from that shaft. No mistake
about that. Long John Sanders said, “I’ll
be !” Not a nice thing to say, and
women present too, but if profanity had
ever been sanctified. Long John sancti-
fied it then.
ALIGHT was quickly lowered, and
there was Georgie all right, lying in
the soft sludgy mud at the bottom. Tom
was lowered on a rope, and hauled up
with Georgie in his arms. A very dirty
Georgie, pickled in mud, and very white
of face. But Georgie, and undoubtedly
alive.
Again Long John extended the invita-
tion that he’d “be !” Then he said
“That is the first shaft I looked down, and
he wasn’t in it then. He wasn't, I tell
you!” Others, more refined than Long
John, translated the sentiment into, “Well,
what do you know about that! ”
Dr. Hallick was out as fast as his two
grey ponies could fetch him. He said
Georgie would be all right, nothing
broken. Bad shock though, and con-
cussion. Keep him quiet in bed. Be out
again the morning, just as a precaution.
He’d be all right, though, and as good
as gold in a very few days. Then he said
a gruff) cheering word to Ellen, and told
her to get to bed too. He didn’t bother
about Mother. You don’t have to waste
time and words on women like Mother.
The crowd hung around till all the ex-
citement had died away and the doctor
had gone. Near the end of it old Looee
Slade hobbled over.
“Been a lot different,” said Looee, “if
there had been water.” Looee seemed a
trifle disappointed that there had been
no water.
As to Georgie himself, he was as good
as gold in a few days, and more spoilt
than ever. Ellen —well, you couldn’t
blame Ellen for spoiling him now.
Georgie couldn’t tell how he came to be
that shaft. And of course he had no
knowledge of what St. Anthony had done
towards his being discovered.
But St. Anthony got his full credit and
was raised even higher in estimation as
a powerful and benevolent saint. Mother
vowed there and then that she would put
a whole pound in the poor-box next Sun-
day. She couldn’t afford a pound very
well, but St. Anthony must know how
grateful she was. In any case, she could
always sell a turkey or two for the money.
For a long time after Tim kept his
little flock away from the gully. But that
may have been coincidence.
GOLD DREDGE.
The dredge sings in the morning
Before ever a bird is awake.
Sparrow and thrush and starling in the
town
Are faithful to daybreak;
But the bush birds are silent,
Only the rustle of leaves and the falling of
water fills
The valleys. They have gone
Deep into the hills.
The dredge sings day and night.
You can’t hear from the town the clatter
of falling stones,
Nor the water she drinks and spews out,
But her song travels afar,. . .
Maybe, look, you can see a light
Too low down in the sky to be a star!
The dredge works night and day. The
great squat boat
Is just about to turn on another tack.
She takes a year to sail across the paddock
and back
And churn a field to a permanent wake of
stones.
She howls, she sings, sihe screeches like a
chorus of cracked crones!
u y a y back to a couple of mates
With a sluicing claim and a crazy con-
. tra ption of wood,
Piling up mountains of rocks
And scrambling for tiny flakes in the dolly-
box.
Enough to make you laugh

QANTAS EMPIRE AIRWAYS In
BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORA
Maoriland Under Holland
By M. H. Ellis
Mr, Sid Holland's anti-Socialist .Government gained power in
Maoriland 10 days before the Menzies-Fadden parties defeated the
Labor-Socialists in Australia. Each country is interested in the efforts
of the other to restore economic stability and rural and industrial
productivity. What has been happening in Maoriland over the past
six months is told here.
ONE of the virtues of Mr.
Sid Holland’s Maoriland
is that it is a place of
realities. Even the Press
is affected by its realism.
Beautiful brides who run away
rate only a paragraph. And
all the models, lovelies, race-
horses, jockeys and s.-p. Gala-
hads could go and jump in
the lake as far as the newspapers
are concerned if the price of
butterfat or the oat yield hap-
pened to go up 10 per cent.
There is an orderly stolidity
about the news from Maori-
land which is pleasing to the
Australian eye, nerve-wracked
by comics and irritated by the
suppression of news of national
importance in the interests of
due notice for vice, sex, crime
and night life.
At the same time, it is a little
depressing to read the naked
truth about New Zealand every
day, because almost exactly what
is happening in Australia is hap-
pening, or has happened, in New
Zealand, save that Labor there
is not so wedded to the class-
war and has shown guts in deal-
ing with the Red question and
that the community very ob-
viously understands its prob-
lems and takes a more serious
daily interest in them than in
what will win at Harold Park
next week.
Parliament in June
The new Nationalist Govern-
ment has been in office now for
about six months. It has not yet
met Parliament, which is ex-
pected to assemble about June
20, the month before the
Nationalist party conference
meets in Mr. Holland’s home
city of Christchurch. Labor
leaders have repeatedly de-
manded an early meeting,
though in language which
seems strangely mild to Aus-
tralians Mr. Fraser and his
lieutenants do not seem to have
called the Prime Minister a
Fascist or likened him to Hitler
even once; and the word Ges-
tapo so far does not seem to
have seeped into the Maoriland
Labor party’s vocabulary. Mr.
Holland’s reply is that he is not
going to meet Parliament until
he has a fully-matured and con-
structive programme to put
before it and until he has
thoroughly untangled the diffi-
cult financial situation which is
his legacy from 15 years of
Labor rule.
When Mr. Fraser becomes a
little heated Mr, Holland merely
quotes a letter which Mr. Fraser
himself wrote in 1947 when the
delayed meeting of Parliament
was a matter of complaint by
the then Opposition which is now
the Government. It says every-
thing for the Prime Minister
which he might want to say at
present.
The situation of New Zealand
on the eve of the meeting of the
first Nationalist Parliament
since before World War II is
this: It subsists on external
markets which are best adapted
to its purposes of any —wool,
meat and dairy produce. The
prices of all these are high, but
have been rendered higher by
subsidies designed to “stabilise”
and to make up the leeway be-
tween inflated costs and not so
inflated returns. It has a dollar
deficit of about 30,000,000 dol-
lars which it has reduced con-
siderably in the past few months
and is hard put to it to meet it.
Its balance in London is about
£54,000,000, but most of this is
required for bank-adjustment
purposes, and there is only a
free margin of about £6,000,000
in the guise of “spendable cash.”
Its sterling-balance position is
responsible for the unavoidable
continuance of petrol-rationing.
Its population has passed the
1,900,000 mark and is expected
to be above 2,000,000 in three
years, with an increasing annual
problem of youth employment
due to the increased birthrate
of the past decade.
And while it sets against these
facts a record production, both
as to quantities and to value,
and the satisfactory position that
many of its larger political ques-
tions are non-party, so that com-
pulsory service introduced by
the Labor Government presents
no problem, and the unions
themselves are to be heard ask-
ing for a development confer-
ence to bring about liaison be-
tween the Government and all
sections of the community for
expansion of industry and pro-
duction, the new Government
has little reason to be happy
about its difficulties.
Legacies of Socialism
The corpse of Socialism lies
dead in its front bedroom. The
creditors of Labor’s bankrupt
estate haunt the doorstep, and
the will, which is now fully
understood, has proved to be
one of those engaging documents
so familiar to the families of
philanthropists in which the
dear departed has left something
to everybody and only an excess
of liabilities with which to pay
out.
Also, there is a disease abroad,
left rampant by «the defunct
Administration, in the form of
raging inflation which led
Mr. Holland to intone upon
the body a valedictory in which
he said that New Zealand had .
been “travelling false trails —one
along the path of the idea that
nothing should be held up for
money whether it was available
or not; the other directed to a
destination at which money was
believed to grow on mulberry-
trees.”
The word “inflation,” in fact,
is a frequent one in Mr. Hol-
land’s vocabulary, he being
Minister for Finance as well as
Prime Minister. He says it is
due to shortness of capital and
to the attempts of the Socialist
Government to do things beyond
its resources. He sums up:
Inflation is an insidious method of
taxing the people by increasing the
cost of living and reducing purchas-
ing-power It is causing shortages
of labor and materials and generally
distorting the country’s internal
economy, while causing serious diffi-
culties in the oversea balance of pay-
ments. It has hit the working people
hardest. N.Z. is living, both exter-
nally and internally, far beyond its
income, and has been meeting the
internal deficiency by creating Reserve
Bank credit and currency without
corresponding production of goods or
services.
But, with an overhaul of the
expenditure programme, he feels
that though the position is
“serious” there is “no need for
alarm.”
Serious it undoubtedly is on
the figures, or would have been
if allowed to go on. With the
gay abandon of a slightly
elevated lady doing the bargain
sales armed with her husband’s
cheque-book, the late un-
lamented Government, The
aroma of whose remains stifl
fills the Dominion, went about
making itself good with the
electors regardless of cost.
Planned Extravagance
It left behind it a legacy of
a works programme to cost
£368,000,000 within the next
seven years, exclusive of another
programme of £45,000,000 for
local-government works. The
main item includes £92,000,000
of expenditure from sterling
funds which don’t at present
exist. And the total, according
to the present head of the Gov-
ernment, is a mere £250,000,000
(not taking into account the
lavish plans for local govern-
ment) more than can be raised
from the public for the purposes
planned by borrowing and taxa-
tion.
There was a deficiency in pub-
lic accounts at the end of the
past year on March 31 —Maori-
land follows British practice in
ending its year on that date —•
estimated at £28,794,000, a gap
which the Fraser Government
gaily bridged by collaring
“temporarily” £2,794,000 of
social-security trust reserves and
as gaily ordering the Reserve
Bank, whose policy has been
under control of the Treasury,
to manufacture £26,000,000 of
credit* This problem and the
economies called for to meet it
must be faced by the new cus-
todians of Maoriland with a
heavy and growing load of sub-
sidies on their shoulders if they
are t° T aintain something like
The Socialists have paid subsi-
dies on almost everything under
th ® ?un, including Socialism it-
self m all its forms.
Eggs, tea, coal, woollen goods
milk, bread, butter and railway
and air transport are all subsi-
dised.
This year the total figure is
about £15,000,000; next year
if it is allowed to, the grand
aggregate of subsidies will reach
£17,000,000, a cool £8 10s per
head of population, including
ancients on the edge of the gray?
and infants uttering their first
cry at the sight of the bonus-
ridden world into which they
have fallen.
It is no wonder that Mr. Hol-
land holds that subsidies are
becoming “a substantial item in
the load of taxation” and that
the benefits to the people have
come to be illusory,” besides
being a major budgetary prob-
lem and “ripe for review.”
There is no wonder, either,
looking at the general careless-
ness with which manufactured
money has been flung about,
even in a way which seems
novel when implemented by a
Labor Government, “the pay-
ment of overseas debt before it
was due when renewal on advan-
tageous terms would have been
the wiser course,” that it is pro-
posed as early as possible to
take from the Finance Minister
his statutory power to dictate to
the Reserve Bank and to leave
the issue of currency and credit
to be determined by economic
considerations.

passengers than the passengers
themselves. The scale of fares
then did not cover the bare
operating cost of s\d. per mile,
much less the cost of ground
organisation, aerodrome main-
tenance and interest on capital,
all these amounting to about sd.
per mile. Passengers (the
Minister said) were paying 4d.
a mile, and for every mile the
fourpenny passengers travelled
the taxpayers provided sixpence,
or in the aggregate about £6 16s.
per passenger over 200,000 pas-
sengers.
Postal Losses
The Post Office, which form-
erly showed a steady profit of
£1,000,000, was down this last
year £350,000. Broadcasting,
previously a paying proposition,
has been scratching to break
even—its State orchestra, which
was to cost £40,000 a year, actu-
ally cost £lOO,OOO last year. The
State Housing Department will
lose £174,000 on 1950-51, and
would have lost another £60,000-
odd if the new Government had
not increased rents over a range
of rented houses.
And among the other things
which Socialism has bequeathed
are claims from 288 owners of
coal deposits, which the Coal
Act of 1948 transferred entirely
to Crown ownership, amounting
to £1,549,000,000, or nearly 2j
times Maoriland’s national debt
of £615,000,000.
Mr. Holland and his col-
leagues discontinued the hear-
ings of the Coal Valuation Com-
mission last January.
Trends of Policy
The trend of economic
measuies so far has been tend-
ing towards the restoration of
absolutely free enterprise, so
soon as it can be achieved, with
economy in public works and an
extension of markets and the
tourist trade, the last avenue
to be cultivated with great care
under the wing of Mr. Fred
Doidge as a probable source of
much-needed dollars.
Some measures which have
been taken include the freeing
from control of land sales, which
seems to have led to great com-
petition for homes in the range
of £2500 to £3OOO without undue
inflation of prices.
Land-resumption laws have
been amended to make it pos-
sible for the vendor-elect of
land resumed for soldier-settle-
ment to refuse to take the Gov-
ernment price, though if he re-
fuses he cannot sell his property
otherwise than to a soldier-
settler. At the same time there
is to be an extension of farm-
settlement. Power projects likely
to expand industry are being
gone ahead with. Housing, and
particularly rural housing, is
being stimulated by the raising of
the borrowing limit for home-
building to £200(), of which re-
turned soldiers may borrow to
100 per cent, of the total and
others to 90 per cent, on 35-year
repayment terms.
Encouragement is to be given
to renters of State houses to buy
their homes on this basis. Wage-
pegging has ended and the right
has been restored to give greater
rewards for greater services—
the public service, by the way,
has been appealing before a tri-
bunal for increased all-round
salaries.
The “Labor” federation is
proposing an increase in the
basic wage of £2 ss. per week as
its contribution to the solution
of Maoriland’s financial diffi-
culties.
Financial Policy
A new financial policy is to be
applied to the railways, the
losses on which, according to the
Minister, were due in the period
1947-50 not to inefficiency but
to the policy of the Socialist
Government of failing to increase
freight and passenger charges on
a reasonable scale—there was
only one increase of 15-20 p.c.
on fares and freights between
1938 and the present time. There
is to be a reorganisation to' in-
clude, possibly, the replacement
of uneconomic railway branches
by feeder roads, and it is be-
lieved that under the new plan
the lines as a whole should pay
at least 1| per cent, profit.
Removal of sales tax on
domestic appliances was an early
measure of the new Government,
and as from the middle of April
an interim advisory committee,
aided by a special technical com-
mittee, at work overhauling the
system of import control and
deciding what goods can be ex-
empted altogether; also, tariff
groupings and other matters
affecting import licences for 1951
which are promised for July in-
stead of November as formerly.
Expansion of production, both
for sale to the United Kingdom,
which takes 97 per cent, of
Maoriland dairy produce, under
existing agreements, and to other
countries, is being handled
jointly with producer organisa-
tions.
A move is to be made to re-
turn the control of union man-
agement to the rank-and-file, per-
haps through secret ballot and
the regulation of compulsory
political levies by unions.
Lastly, there is a works pro-
gramme for capital works neces-
sary to overcome power short-
ages, building shortages, includ-
ing hospitals, schools and houses,
to be financed in part by the
Government’s first loan, which
will open on May 29, a few days
before the Parliamentary session
begins, with possibly an overseas
loan to build overseas external
balances to pay for imported
capital goods of the type of
hydroelectric equipment.
The Medical Scheme
On the social side, the Govern-
ment has many plans in hand,
some likely to be unpopular in
interested quarters—such as the
restoration of the death penalty
—and some popular, such as the
provision of 50 per cent, of the
cost of institutional homes built
by societies for old people, and
the more widely interesting
matter of medical and pharma-
ceutical benefits, the existing
scheme being maintained with
modifications to abate abuses.
Doctors will now be able to
decide whether they will charge
the patient direct and leave him
to recover from the fund or
accept payment direct from the
fund. In place of the present
flat rate per visit the new ar-
rangements provide for a fee
“not exceeding 7s. 6d.,” and dis-
ciplinary committees are being
set up to police certain features
of the amended legislation, such
as the restored right of doctors
to sue for amounts not recover-
able from the Social Security
Fund.
Dealing with medical and
pharmaceutical expenditures and
curbing the enthusiasm both
of some types of patients and
unscrupulous medicoes who have
built up a sort of mass-produc-
tion organisation must be a head-
acjhe to the new Administration,
since the cost of medical bene-
fits has increased from £831,000
in 1943 to £2,500,000, in the year
just past, while prescriptions,
from averaging about two per
inhabitant of the Shivery Islands
in 1943, have risen to 7,000,000
total, or per inhabitant, at
a total cost of over £1 per head
of population in 1949-50.
The Legislative Council
Whatever the Government in-
tends in legislation next
month, it may not find easy,
since Mr. Holland faces the same
problem as Mr. Menzies, though
no doubt with more hope, in the
Upper House, the abolition of
which he has always advocated.
At present it has 25 members, 19
of them crusted Socialists —or at
least not Nationalists.
Mr. Holland, as a private
member, twice has introduced
private members’ bills into Par-
liament to destroy the now-very-
awkward excrescence which he
said during the 1946 election
campaign “performs no , useful
function and will be abolished,”
a sentiment which he qualified
during the recent campaign with
a further promise that upon the
Council’s abolition the National-
ists would “examine the possible
alternatives to provide some
form of safeguard against hasty
or ill-considered legislation.”
Certain it is 'that legislation
passed by the Imperial Parlia-
merit in 1947 made it possible
for New Zealand Parliament to
amend its Constitution, and the
Government now has in mind
the creation of a written Consti-
tution, especially designed to
prevent a recurrence of inci-
dents in which a Socialist Gov-
ernment since 1947 has virtu-
ally altered the existing one by
the passage of simple bills for
which it had no mandate from
the electors.
Certain it is, also, that what-
ever the Government attempts,
the Labor Opposiiton, to which
it has not endeared itself by its
trenchant criticisms, will use the
Legislative Council in particular
to thwart it if it can. If it does,
the Council being a nominated
House, Mr. Holland will no
doubt find a willing suicide
squad to remove the obstacle
pending the next election, which
will be fought after the 1951
census, on new allotments of
quotas possibly based, not on
total regional numbersof electors,
but on total population of ail
ages, together with a freer give-
and-take in quota margins to
deal equitably with areas re-
mote from close settlement.
Despite soaring production,
the approval by the Maoris of a
new five-point programme to
simplify their land and social
and economic problems and a
general support from the major
Press, there is little room for
Australian politicians to envy
Mr. Holland and his followers
during the next few months,
though some inhabitants of
N. S. Wales might like a small
share of the drought which at
present affects parts of the
Dominion.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
AUSTRALIA AND MALAYA.
Australians generally, and
many of their “political leaders,”
are “dangerously ignorant —and
as a result indifferent —of what
goes on in Malaya.”
The view thus roughly ex-
pressed by Singapore “Sunday
Times,” and in effect by the
“Straits Times” also, can be
taken as the most widely typical
present Malayan view of this
country, and one which would
take some refuting, even though
the “political leaders” referred
to are only the discredited
Chifleys.
The Singapore “Sunday
Times” puts the blame down to
“the scanty information pub-
lished in most Australian
papers” ; the same holds also for
British papers, which, apart
from some good reporting by the
Singapore correspondent of Lon-
don “Times,” mostly ignore
Malaya, or else, like the
Chifleys, view it with affected
Leftish sentimentalism, which is
even more misleading.
On that point, London
“Economist” has recently in-
sisted that in Britain a “most
downright change of attitude is
needed.. . .the Malayan emerg-
ency has not yet been f seriously
treated as the prime threat to the
Commonwealth, which it cer-
tainly represents.”
More troops, it added, are
required in Malaya: “It may
not be possible to recruit and
send them without a change in
public opinion; but what has
been done to keep an issue such
as this in the public eye here at
home?.... Far stronger and
more frequent statements are
needed from London that Britain
means to rtay in Malaya and
see the emergency through ; in
spite of the presence of British
forces many Asiatics there —and
Europeans, too doubt it.
Morale is the essence of the
Malayan war, and it is folly not
to do all that is possible to sus-
tain it.”
The charge of Australian
ignorance of Malaya in the
Singapore papers was mainly
in reaction to the discredited
Chifleys’ “manifesto,” the “Sun-
day Times” further comment-
ing :
“What greater lack of appre-
ciation of the true position in
this area [Malayd] could have
been shown than that exhibited
by Australian Labor in its mani-
festo directed against the sugges-
tion that an Australian volunteer
force could be sent to Malaya
to fight the bandits.
“The manifesto has, as could
be expected, found applause only
in the columns of London’s
[Communist] ‘Daily Worker.’
Much of what was published
under the name of Australian
Labor could not have been more
suited to the ‘Daily Worker’s’
columns if its text had been pre-
pared by one of that paper’s own
editorial writers.
“Its reference to the campaign
in Malaya as a civil disturbance ;
its suggestion that Malays,
Chinese and Indians should be
asked for an opinion on the
fighting here; its general lack
of appreciation of the real
urgency of the war in Malaya—
all of these show a degree of
ignorance which goes beyond
that of political convenience.
“It should be brought strongly
to the attention of Australians
that, so far as Malayans are con-
cerned, the intervention of Aus-
tralian troops would be wel-
comed —even beyond that, and
despite the statements to the
contrary in London, they are
thought by many to be urgently
necessary.
“Australians might also be
told that what is a civil distur-
bance in Malaya today might
be an Australian war tomorrow,”
The “Straits Times” sees the
Chifleys’ attack on what they
suspect is the Menzies Govern-
ment’s policy as being “en-
gendered by memory of defeat
at the polls”—in other words,
that sourness which was already
noticeable enough, in their leader
and others, when they were in
office and has become ten times
worse since.
“Australians,” the “Straits
Times” editorially comments,
“may be left to decide for them-
selves whether Mr. Harrison was
in fact ‘deplorably frivolous’ in
urging a realistic outlook on
Malaya’s ■ Communist war, or
whether the demand for a
Pacific Pact and the recruiting
of volunteers for service in
Malaya conveys an impression of
‘irresponsibility and aggression.’
Malaya’s own reaction to the
Labor executive’s manifesto is,
of course, bewilderment at the
tender yet ill-born regard which
the Chifleys and Calwells now
have for the feelings of Asians.
“But Australian Labor ought
to know on whose behalf it has
become so solicitous so sud-
denly. It is not on behalf of
Malayans. The ‘unwarranted
imputation of opinions to the
Malay people’ (to quote to the
exact letter) of which the Labor
executive complains in connec-
tion with statements made by
Australia’s Defence Minister
when in Singapore obviously is
a criticism more properly
addressed - to the Labor mani-
festo. If, by good fortune and
the comradeship of Common-
wealth, Australia finds it possible
to give the people of Malaya
real help in the hot war against
Communism, Malaya will accept
with gratitude, and remember
with thankfulness. That is not
an unwarranted opinion, but a
statement of fact.
“The profound misconception
under which the [Chifley] party
caucus is laboring is evident in
almost every sentence of criti-
cism, nowhere more clearly than
in the manifesto’s description of
the Malayan war as ‘civil dis-
turbances.’ Technically this
description may be correct, just
as Japan’s war against China,
because neither side ever de-
clared war, was never more than
an incident which became an
emergency. The Malayan war
remains an ‘emergency’ for
largely similar reasons, but not
even in Australia would anyone
literate enough to read the news-
papers look upon this emergency
as other than a very consider-
able disturbance indeed, while
those who profess an intelligent
interest in national affairs should
know it for what it is. The
Malayan war is not a rising of
Malayan nationalists. It is part
and parcel of the Communist

THE OLD UPHILL ROAD.
world war. The Communists in
Moscow, in Peking and in the
Malayan jungle, all have said so.
Why should Australian Labor
not believe them?
“No attempt has been made
to analyse the attitude of the
Malay, Chinese and Indian
populations of Malaya, says the
Labor manifesto. No real infor-
mation has been given on the
subject of the activities of
British, Gurkha or locally-
recruited troops. It is incredible
that Australian Labor leaders,
who so recently formed the Gov-
ernment of Australia, should
make so sweeping a claim of
total ignorance. Presumably
they must now be credited with
the incomprehension they pro-
fess, though this is sad comment
indeed on Labor mentality and
on the failure of Labor, when in
office, to inform itself on a prob-
lem which intrudes within Aus-
tralia’s sphere. Yet again, even
a cursory reading of newspaper
dispatches could have partly
illumined the darkness. It is
tragic that the simplest truths on
Malaya have not penetrated the
Chifley mind.
“The help that Malaya would
accept from Australia would
not be help in the policing of
a colonial possession—in the
sense in which the Labor mani-
festo use§ that phrase. It would
be help in ensuring that the
Attlee pledge to Malaya is
honored, as of course it will be.
It would be help in restoring
peace and order and freedom
from terror. Malayan progress
towards responsible government,
which Australian Labor would
foster, remains ambushed until
this is done. Is it against Aus-
tralian interests that the Malayan
people should be released from
the terror of Communist
thuggery and the menace of
Communist aggression? In the
concept of Commonwealth is
there to be no place for mutual
assistance? But perhaps the
final answer to Australia’s Labor
caucus is this: not yet has
Malaya asked for help, and it is
inconceivable that the British
Government will make any such
approach without the knowledge
and consent of Malayans. The
Chifleys can begin their debate
from there.”
It should be added, regarding
the Menzies offer “to consider
any British request for help,”
that Edinburgh “Scotsman” has
reported that this had been
“studied at the highest level in
London.” Adding dryly that
“No such invitation was forth-
coming from Australia’s Labor
Government headed by Mr.
Chifley, in which Dr. Evatt was
the Minister for External
Affairs,” the Edinburgh paper
stated that the request for help
would be made by Lord Mac-
donald, here for this week’s con-
ference on South-east Asia.
On Bevin.
On the ground that his ill-
health makes such a change
urgent, both in his own and his
country’s interests, London
“Daily Telegraph” has run a
leader suggesting that Mr. Bevin
should now be relieved of
“responsibility for a Depart-
ment.”
In the course of the article,
however, it pays tribute to him
as one “now in the seventieth
year of an unusually hard-spent
life”:
“It is for historians rather
than Mr. Bevin’s contemporaries

Divided West.
Conferences now taking place
or shortly due will show the ex-
tent to which the Western states
men of Europe endorse or are
able to support the view of US
Secretary of State Acheson that
the West must employ “total
diplomacy”—a most embracing
term—to counter the Russian im-
perialist expansion aided by
Communist fifth-columnists in
all countries.
The suggestion has been as
good as unanimously endcu-sed
by the U.S. and also by the
British Press. As typical of the
latter, London “Time and Tide”
comments:
. “First, we must realise that
since the Russian plans are
planetary in scope, the answer to
them —the counter-plan of the
free peoples— must also be
planetary in scope. What we
have at the moment is a series
of unrelated and disconnected
responses.
“Secondly, we must recognise
that the activities of Communist
parties throughout the world are
co-ordinated activities, activities
planned well in advance and as
related to each othef as the in-
dividual parts of a jig-saw
puzzle. This being so, the anti-
communist measures of the
Governments of the free world
should be similarly arranged and
co-ordinated.”
Something of the prevailing
hopeless division which Acheson
must have had in mind is indi-
cated in editorial comment by
London “Economist,” reporting
that the need for united Western
strategy is now becoming steadily
more widely accepted, as well it
might be:
“With each new manifestation
of Soviet hostility—whether it be
the shooting-down of planes or
the organising of provocative
demonstrators in Berlin or the
reinforcement of the Chinese
Communists with fighter aircraft
—the Western Powers have a
warning that they are enveloped
in a global hostility that demands
as global a resistance. Ociaiy
enough, however, the la
months have on the whole bee
a period of rather more Allied
disunity than usual.” .
Three main issues, reports *

understanding, and, so r,

Recognising Spain.
Among the highly important

£i" Lo “ don ’ °n e n° £ ,w
Sret and thorniest, will be that
„f bases, especially air-bases, to

ides into shooting war.
Reporting from The Hague,
where the first steps were taken
S month, a special corres-
o dent of’ Edinburgh “Scots-
man” asserted that the U.S. was
pressing for the acquisition of
such bases'in Spam. Moreover:
“The main opposition, which
comes from Britain and France,
is understood to be more or less
lukewarm. It is not suggested
that Spain be allowed to join the
Atlantic Pact, but that a separate
arrangement be made for leas-
ing and developing airfields in
return for better commercial and
diplomatic treatment of Spain.
Portugal is among the smaller
nations pressing for exploitation
of Spanish defence capabilities.
“The military leaders are ap-
parently agreed on the matter,
but because of its larger politi-
cal overtone it cannot be settled
by that. It is understood that
the United States will probably
raise the question at the ‘Big
Three’ Foreign Ministers’ meet-
ing in London, and that it is
likely then to be referred to the
chiefs of Government for final
decision.”
An Important Book.
In a London “Observer”
article-length review under the
heading “Prospect for Freedom,”
the writer describes Modern
Arms and Free Men, by Van-
nevar Bush (Heinemann), as “the
most important book at present
on the market.”
Its author the former chair-
man of the American war-time
Defence Research Committee
(and hence a leading figure in
atomic and other such develop-
ments), the book is assessed by
the reviewer as having three
unique merits;
First, he says, it gives more
authoritative and reliable news
°n the present state of
, e sconce of armaments than
all the world’s newspapers to-
gether have contained during the
last five years.
Secondly, it corrects the false

portions.

THE WATCH ON THE BRINE.
Thus, while it is, for instance,
ruinous to mass-produce air
fleets which will go on the
scrapheap in a few years without
ever having fought, because
every aircraft now in production
will be obsolete in about five
years’ time, air forces must
meanwhile be kept at a reason-
ably safe strength.
“The Russians, unless they
intend to start war in the immedi-
ate future, are, it appears, making
a serious mistake just now, in
building near-obsolete last-war
bombers by the thousand. The
same holds for most other
weapons, such as tanks,
ordnance, naval craft, and for
many ammunition types. Even
atom-bomb stockpiles may have
to be written off at some per-
haps not very distant date, be-
cause defence will have caught
up with them.”
On the question of the survival
value of different political sys-
tems in this scientific age, the
American authority is quoted as
quite certain that democracy,
with its elasticity, is at any rate
enormously better fitted to deal
with the challenge which that in-
volves than is rigid dictatorship.
He “makes the striking observa-
tion that Hitler ensured his ulti-
mate defeat in advance by
‘destroying the great structure of
German science’ at the very
moment when he came to power
and set out to rearm. There are
signs that Stalin is similarly ham-
handed in dealing with Soviet
science.” _
Church and Dean.
Two things no doubt puzzled
many in connection with the
poseur-tour of these parts by the
Dean of Canterbury: (1) how a
leading Christian churchman
could reconcile his religion with
Russia’s thoroughly well-
authenticated institution of a
slave system on a scale (some
16,000,000 slaves, men and
women) and of a brutality as
dreadful as history has ever
recorded; and (2) why the
church itself should tolerate such
a Kremlin-serving and Com-
munist-serving missionary.
The first question will no
doubt have to stand over until
the actual true character and the
activities of the Dean are more
clearly revealed by the processes
of time. What may be a suffi-
cient explanation of the second
question, however, has been
given in an evidently authorita-
tive letter in “Manchester
Guardian,” written in comment
on a Hou» of Lords speech on
the Kremlin and Communist
conspiracy in the course of
wh l ch V or ? V \ nsitt ?« named
various leadme churchmen.

stated, “very properly believes
that disciplinary action ought to
be taken by the church against

ciplinafy action, but until the
Houses of Parliament (including
the critics of the Upper House)
allow the church her rightful and
much-desired liberty there is no
ground for complaint against her
on this score by implication or
otherwise.”
In other words, the church,
because it is denied the neces-
sary powers for disciplinary
action, has to suffer politically-
made appointments to it as
everybody else has to suffer
them.
Polio Report.
London “Economist” has re-
ferred to a report published in
the British medical journal the
“Lancet” regarding “an associa-
tion that was found in Mel-
bourne last year between inocu-
lations of children against diph-
theria and whooping-cough and
subsequent attacks of polio-
myelitis.
“It should be emphasised,”
the “Economist” remarks, “that
there was no evidence that im-
munisation caused poliomyelitis
or that the children concerned
were infected by the contamina-
tion of the immunising agent or
the syringes—that they de-
veloped poliomyelitis at all could
be explained quite simply by the
occurrence of a severe epidemic
at the time.
“The significant finding,” the
“Lancet” points out, “was the
association between the site of
the injection and the site and de-
.gree of the subsequent paralysis.
It seems, in fact, that inocula-
tions, particularly against whoop-
ing-cough, may have to be added
to tonsil operations, heavy exer-
cise and other physical distur-
bances as being likely to deter-
mine whether paralysis will ensue
from an attack of poliomyelitis
and, if so, its location and sever-
ity. The Ministry of Health’s
studies of experience in this
country [Britain] will be awaited
with interest.”
Dragnet Digest.
Vital Germany. —Holding that “It
is no good blinking our eyes to the
fact that, with the exception of the
failure of the Berlin blockade, the
Russians* are winning the cold war,”
London “Time and Tide” sees Ger-
many as the really vital issue: “The
more the Russians win the cold war
the greater the danger that they will
be tempted to adopt the hot war to
bring about the ‘final overthrow’
which their apocalyptic vision pre-
scribes, If Germany goes, France
and Italy would become untenable.
It is whether Germany is to go that
the weeks and months immediately
ahead will settle.”

“Cold War Ministry.” —A London
“Daily Telegraph” letter-writer puts
forward a suggestion for the setting-
up in Britain (and presumably in any
other democracy vitally concerned)
of a special, separate Cold War
Defence Ministry, to carry out re-
search and propaganda and safeguard
key strongholds: “Its existence would
permanently and automatically bring
home to all both the reality of the
cold war and our determination to
fight it as a national menace. Further,
the other free democracies would
mutually benefit from the experience
that would be learnt, accumulated and
pooled.”
* * * *
“Family-circle” Policy. —The “Scots-
man” (Edinburgh), reporting a state-
ment by Mr. Bevin that in the
view of the other Governments
at the Colombo Conference there
was no incompatibility between
British policy towards Western Euro-
pean Union and the maintenance of
traditional links with the British
Commonwealth, says that the pre-
cedent there established was that
Britain is to remain the intermediary
in all contact between Europe and
the Dominions. It claims also that
London has developed over the past
few months a much better system of
keeping Dominion Governments in-
formed of developments inside the
Marshall-aid organisation. Through
a new high-level committee, “con-
fidential” information is passed on,
so that Commonwealth officials can
now be much better informed on
current economic progress in Euro-
pean trade and production. “This,”
it adds, “expresses exactly the British
preference for step-by-step develop-
ment of closer relations between the
British Commonwealth on one side
and Continental Europe on the other.”

Britain Fades from Greece. —One
Englishman, Byron, won’t be for-
gotten there; a new book on him
(according to N. Y, “Herald
Tribune” report) has been eagerly
bought up by Athenians. But, while
“the Byron legend remains strong in
Greece, that of Whitehall fades.”
The story of Britain in Greece, from
Byron to Churchill, “has been
swiftly drawing to a close since the
end of World War II.” Gradually
withdrawn, the last of Britain’s troops
have now gone, leaving only small
missions of the three Services. Uncle
Sam has taken over from J. Bull:
“This all-out orientation of Athens
political life toward the United States
climaxes a recent development of a
historic nature —the waning of British
influence in Greek affairs.”
* * * *
Social Services or Defence ?
Allowing that it is “a shocking thing
to be spending nearly £BOO million a
year on defence in what is supposed
to be a time of peace,” London
“Economist” suggests that that is
nothing out of the way compared
with what is being spent on the
“welfare State”: “In 1938, expendi-
ture on the social services was just
below that on defence; in 1949, if
food subsidies are included, it was
nearly double. If the community can
‘afford’ to spend 131 per cent, of its
income on the welfare State, can it
not afford 7 per cent, for defence?,”
* * * *
After Joe? —In a detailed review
of the Politburo’s members, a Lon-
don “Observer” concludes that two
of the younger ones, Malenkov and
Beria, are already more important
than all their seniors, except perhaps
Molotov; “Malenkov has the Party
and Beria the Police. If they are on
good terms, and can work together,
they could easily make themselves
supreme when Stalin goes. Ranged
against one another, they could bring
the Soviet Union down in ruins.
Nobody knows what they will do, or
whether they will work in harmony
with Molotov. But Malenkov’s
record suggests that he will be kept
from the ultimate leadership of Russia
only by death or revolution.”

The Churchill Touch. —Without any
question the grand touch is still
there, and as outstanding as ever,
Mr. Churchill’s recent foreign-
affairs speeches emphasising that he
remains the greatest of living states-
men. In one of them he said; “The
dominant forces of history have
come from the perception of great
truths and the faithful pursuance of
great causes.” On which, London
“Economist”: “Yet in recent dis-
cussions of policy in the West the
crusading note, the needed touch of
grandeur, have been missing. In
reaffirming his faith that European
unity and the revival of Western
civilisation are causes worthy of the
devotion of free men, Mr. Churchill
brought back the great themes to
Parliament and, for a time at least,
silenced the cynical, the partisan, the
disillusioned and the afraid. ‘How
easy it is to impair great unities,
and how hard to make them.’ If Mr.
Churchill had said no more than that,
his speech would have been memor-
able.”

“Good afternoon, sir!”

I strongly suspected the two-
* headed turtle had a split per-
sonality the moment it opened
its mouths. For 40 minutes the
two heads had been engaged in
heated discussion, and from
snatches of conversation I
managed to gather that, whilst
one head, which possessed a face
soft, gentle and beautiful, desired
to attend some form of religious
meeting in a hall near by, the
other, with a face gnarled, evil
and fraught with cunning,
expostulated in uncouth and im-
proper language that its only
desire was to proceed to the
Frog and Arms with all
dispatch and get as full as a
boot.
As the strange conversation
proceeded I could not help but
ponder on the noble motive of
the one and the base one of the
other. Did such a split per-
sonality exist in all of us? Were
we all Jekyll and Hydes? So
engrossed was I in the subject

holic shouting. For a moment
I was assailed with the desire
to enter for a Jimmy Woodser,

thought, turned abruptly on my
heel. At that precise instant,
believe it or not, there was a

felt my personality split; and all
I could do was to dash inside
and buy ourselves a couple of

was a suggestion of staying ability
in Yardon’s game victory over Old
Jamaica and Waterfront in the first
Juvenile Novice; by the same token
there was, in his position in the
betting order, a strong suggestion
that the win surprised connections as
much as it did the run of punters.
Yardqn is interestingly bred, being
by Tidemark, a son of Wychwood
Abbot-Clamella, who was got in
England and foaled in Australia. Big*
Bess, the dam of Yardon, is a

While punters can be extremely
vocal concerning the failure of favor-
ites, they themselves show some rare
form at times in the matter of
making favorites. A prize example
on Saturday was their manifest eager-
ness to welcome back to Sydney
Beau Robert, a nag whose name must
be held in veneration by a host of
bookmakers. After a string of expen-
sive failures in Sydney a few months
back (favorite and beaten in three
starts out of five) Beau Robert was
hoisted off to try his luck in the
bush. After twice demonstrating his
inability to win at Parkes (N.S.W.),
he made a reappearance at Randwick
on Saturday, and with that formid-
able record as recommendation was
sent out favorite at fours for the
mile Moorebank Handicap. Beau
Robert finished ninth, winner being
Silique, a winner at Canterbury the
previous week yet allowed to start
at 16 to 1 on Saturday.
In other events at Randwick, Battle-
wyse in the mile Three-year-old
Novice, Acquittal in the Flying (6f.),
Grand Beau in the Warwick May
Handicap (12f.) and lolanda in the
Carlita Handicap for three- and four-
year-old fillies and mares were all
comfortable winners.

Highlights of the V.R.C. meeting
at Flemington on Saturday were the
assorted sensations of the Grassmere
Steeple and the damning comment on
the “stayers” at present on hand in
Melbourne, offered by Saxony’s easy
victory in the 14-furlongs Cardinia
Handicap.
In referring to Saxony’s win as a
poor comment on her opponents, it
is not intended to disparage the
game and good little mare that
Saxony is; but the comment is
inescapably obvious. With 9.6, Saxony
conceded the rest from 241 b. to 341 b.,
and beat them pointless; taking
charge at the furlong, Saxony went
on full of running to score by 2\
lengths ; closest to her at the finish
was Potentate, who was in receipt <
of 341 b.
The Grassmere Steeple saw the stiff
new Flemington fences again bring
’em down like ninepins. The rank
outsider River Princess showed real
horse-sense by declining to take any
part in proceedings right from the
start. That left nine participants in
the race; four of these came to grief,
with, unhappily, Avaunt Garde and
Young Victory both killed. Taking
the final jump together, Jevington
and Valboy singled out from the
field in the run home. Half way
up the straight Jevington began to
veer out badly, and, carrying Valboy
with him, seemed certain to put that
horse over the fence. The rider of
Valboy, however, managed to ease
his mount back; Jevington went on
to be first past the post, but there
was scarcely a doubt as to the out-
come of the protest which was
immediately fired in. After a purely
formal retirement the stewards gave
it to Valboy.
Most notable of other events at
Flemington were a couple which
involved mammoth fields charging
down the straight six. The Ferndale
Handicap for two-year-olds lent sup-
port to the old adage “the bigger
the field the greater the certainty,”

n r the day “Lord Wilton has won a
last ” The race in question
was the Adelaide Cup of 1885, and
further reading of the contemporary
reference suggests that it was a rather
unimpressive performance by a some-
what undistinguished horse. But
while Lord Wilton’s name may not
be inscribed very large in a list of
champions of the turf, it has at least
one claim to a permanent place in
the record books in that, because
of betting restrictions then operating
in South Australia, Lord Wilton won
his Adelaide Cup at Flemington.
Since then, of course, the Cup meet-
ing has been back at its proper venue,
but results over the past few years
must lead connections of South Aus-
tralian stayers to wonder if the race
might not just as well still be held
in Melbourne. Last Wednesday saw
Peerless Fox the third Melbourne
visitor in succession to win the
important two-miler.
Peerless Fox’s was a slashing good
win, and a grievous painful one for the
books; in the day or so preceding
the race, and on the course, a con-
stant flood of cash brought the
visitor’s price tumbling down to a
final quote of 7to 4. In the running
of the Cup, particularly in the middle
stages, Peerless Fox struck trouble
galore, and he was in front of only
two horses with three furlongs to go.
The St. Leger-winning filly Auburn
did most of the pacemaking, but she
was beginning to pack up as they
entered the straight; at that stage
Preston took Peerless Fox wide to
gain a clear run on the outside, and
his brilliant finishing burst to defeat
King Comedy by a half-length had
all the marks of an exceptionally
good stayer. Certainly Peerless Fox
can be added to the comparatively
short list of horses whose per-
formances this season make them the
first ones to look for when Melbourne
Cup weights are issued.

Racing at Randwick on Saturday
offered in every regard a thoroughly
mixed grill, The weather turned on
a little bit of everything during the
afternoon; winners ranged from the
fancied to the fanciful; and the
smallish crowd consequently had
opportunity to demonstrate just about
every known variety of “receptions-
accorded- winners.”
Notable among the “receptions-
accorded” were the joyous cheers
which rang out as Sellwood landed
the Two-year-old Novice for fillies
on the hot favorite Putoko, the
violently abusive demonstration which
greeted the same rider when, a little
later, he won another two-year-old
event on Daksha, who was not
favorite, but had been when he had
finished a long way back at his pre-
vious start, and the stone-cold silence
amidst which apprentice P. Hannon
returned to scale after winning
another two-year-old event on
Yardon, a 100-to-l chance, and pay-
Is. 6d. for a win and
to 15s. for a place on the tote.
Both Putoko (a daughter of Sir
t-rusoe) and Daksha (a Dhoti colt)
trained by Maurice McCarten,
and the pair gave McCarten respec-
ively his 14th and 15th two-year-old
of the season. Putoko,

It’s a long, long time since St.
Kilda could draw the second-largest
crowd on a Melbourne football
Saturday, but they did it last Satur-
day, when 25,000 went to see whether
the Saints could make it four wins
in a row. Against North Melbourne,
the toughest side they’ve struck this
season, Saints rushed to an early lead,
and lasted long enough to win by two
points, 12.8-10.18. It puts them equal
with Essendon as the two unbeaten
teams, and when they meet Carlton
next Saturday they’ll possibly have
the biggest crowd of the day. Other
matches: Carlton beat Richmond,
17.15-16.10; Geelong beat Melbourne,
9.16-10.7; Collingwood beat Haw-
thorn, 7.25-6.12; Essendon beat

In Sydney R.U. last Saturday
North of the Harbor beat South of
the Harbor in the first of the season’s
representative matches —a series which
will culminate in the Tests against
the British Isles team. The match
ended on an exciting note, with South
making a vain bid to overcome the
early lead established by North.
North won 19-17. Most pleasing
feature of the game for future selec-
tions was the outstanding perform-
ances “given by the respective full-
backs, Barry and Booth, particularly
Booth, whose game was flawless.
With the retirement of Brian Piper,
regular State and Australian fullback
since the war, selectors can be
grateful for a man of Booth’s calibre.
But Booth, like all our fullbacks,
who are schooled under the Aus-
tralian rule of kicking out on the
full only in their own 25, will have
to adapt himself to the international
rule of kicking out on the full from
any part of the field if he is to be
a success in international football.
And this is not always as easy as
it sounds; repeatedly we have seen
Australian forward packs run off their
feet as a result of their backs failing
to find touch with their kicks. The
important thing to remember is that
the kick that travels only 25 yards
and goes out is much better than
the one that travels twice that dis-
tance but does not go into touch.
A good fullback finds touch with
every kick.

Pickworth, the Melbourne golf pro.,
tied with C. H. Ward and South
African Bobby Locke in the “Daily
Mail” cup at Walton Heath (Eng.),
then lapsed with a 78, 79 in the
play-off, and, though the prizemoney
had been equally divided, could only
run third to Ward and Locke for
the cup. Meantime, Eric Cremin,
who is having a great run this season,
added the Queensland Open (his third)
to his other scalps. He can afford
to sympathise with the struggles of
Von Nida and Pickworth in other
parts.

“The English, who fretted over the
berserk manner in which the Aus-
tralians played tennis in England, are
still throwing up their hands in old-
fashioned horror at the earnestness
of our fellows at cricket. men-
tions mournfully that our men ‘are
putting into the game a grimness that
hardens the sunny nature of it.’ Then
he goes on to say: ‘Did ever a
cricketer get so much antagonism
into cricket as M , the Australian
fast bowler, got into his bowling at
Trent Bridge? His face was set to
a quite pained grimness—a man in
battle itself could wear no aspect
more formidable.’ ”
Sounds awfully familiar, doesn’t
it? However, let the reader be cor-
rected on his natural and automatic
assumption. The M stands not
for Miller but for McDonald, and
the item comes from this page of
December 21, 1922.

The tiger is employed as the
animalistic symbol of Malaya, and it
can certainly be said of Singapore
boxing fans, at least, that they must
be tigers for punishment. A couple
of weeks back the said fans packed
the Happy World Stadium to the
rafters to see Australian Dave Sands
hopelessly outclass “Boy” Brooks;
three rounds saw the end of Brooks.
Evidently unsatiated, the boys piled
in again last week to see a repeat
performance. The race—for that is
all it was —went the full distance, but
Brooks was under the disadvantage
of running backwards all the way.

Improved Branding Fluid.
“C.S.”: The formula of a
new sheep-branding fluid which
remains on the sheep for a year
and is removed from the wool
by normal scouring methods
has been released by C.5.1.R.0.
Brands in use at present re-
sist commercial scouring. The
expense and inconvenience of
the extra sorting to remove
branded wool and the special
processing it requires are con-
stant sources of complaint.
Developed after seven years’
research by the C.5.1.R.0. wool-
research laboratories, the new
brand, known as L.B.E. brand-
ing fluid, has been tested on
sheep in many parts of the coun-
try. Scouring trials on the
branded wool have shown that
the brands will scour out under
commercial conditions.
The preparation is a water
emulsion of lanolin, tallow and
other materials to which suitable
pigments have been added.
Ammonia is lost when the
emulsion is applied to the sheep,
and the waxy pigmented base
which remains is not washed out
by rain. It is removed, however,
when the wool goes through the
hot alkaline soap solution in the
scouring vat. Full details from
the Textile Liaison Officer,
C.5.1.R.0. Wool Textile Labora-
tory, P.O. Box 19, Geelong
(Vic.).
Diesel Engines.
“R.H.G.”: Main difference
between a diesel and a petrol
engine is that in the full diesel
the heat of compression alone is
sufficient to cause the explosion.
Air is compressed by the piston
on the up-stroke, and at a set
point before top dead-centre
fuel is injected, resulting in a
steady explosion which forces
the piston down on the working
stroke with tremendous force.
The whole cycle is radically
different from the petrol engine,
which draws in a pre-arranged
mixture of air and fuel, com-
presses it, and sets it off by a
spark, often a good deal further
ahead of t.d.c. than a diesel, to
allow for the lag in actual com-
bustion. The diesel depends far
more on closely-sealed com-
pression, and leaky rings, etc.,
will cause a severe drop in
efficiency.
Two main drawbacks of
diesels are excessive carbon,
general dirt, and heavy con-
sumption of lubricating oil. Ad-
vantages are saving in fuel costs,
extra h.p. and rugged construc-
tion.
Starting trouble, often the
curse of the small diesel, can be
overcome by squirting petrol
into the air-intake. Heavy oil
can also be used when wear i§
excessive, but only where a
priming cock is fitted. The heavy
oil simply seals up the compres-
sion and forces the necessary
high temperature. If bad start-
ing trouble is experienced don’t
overfill the chamber with addi-
tional fuels, as serious con-
sequences may ensue, among
them a “busted” piston top.
Water is a deadly enemy; see
that faulty gaskets, etc., don’t let
water in overnight or in idle
periods. Heads are usually
water-cooled in some way—
although there are some experi-
mental air-cooled diesels and
the danger is ever-present.
Cooling water should be care-
fully watched, and in all thermo-
syphon types the water must be
above the level of the top or out-
put pipe at all times. Avoid
sharp bends in cooling-water
pipes, and have the tank at the
level recommended by the
manufacturer.
A faulty injector should be
treated with the utmost care, or
replaced. The injection hole is
very small and must not be
tampered with by scratching
with rude tools. The fuel pump
and governor gear require
proper freedom of movement,
occasional cleaning and adjust-
ment according to the instruc-
tion-book, but otherwise should
be trouble-free. If possible,
always get an engine with a
hand-operated fuel pump. To
test the pump and injection is
then simply a matter of working
the hand-lever' attached to the
fuel pump—with the pump “on
stroke” —and a definite groan
should be heard, indicating
proper working.
For timing, in single-cylinder
engines, check the marks on fly-
wheel and crankcase, and listen
for the injection “groan” made
by the automatic part of the
pump. The injector can be re-
moved still attached to the fuel-
injection line, and the actual
spray, which should be very fine,
examined. Be wary of engines
with the injectors forming part
of the water-cooling seal: drain
the water from the heads before
removing them. Obtain informa-
tion about h.p. rating, and buy
an engine that will deliver your
required power at its lowest revs.
Increasing the revs, on diesels
increases the h.p. to a marked
degree ; indeed, some makes are
actually almost identical save for
difference in fly-wheel speeds,
but carry widely different h.p.
ratings.
Diesels, because of the heavy
shock of their working cycle.
must be bedded down solid, not
necessarily on concrete, but at
least with several times their
weight in wood, or with founda-
tions well buried. Extra time
spent in making a good founda-
tion wjll pay in efficient, smooth
running and lack of damaging
vibration.
So-called “semi-diesels” vary
a good deal in efficiency, espe-
cially the two-stroke type ; they
run at much lower compression
pressures and must have out-
side assistance to set off the ex-
plosion, otherwise they’re basi-
cally the same in design. Some
are called “hot-bulb” engines,
requiring a blowlamp to heat up
an ignition plate in the cylinder-
head, against which the fuel is in-
jected. These jobs, because of
lower pressures, are of lighter
"We might get its mate tomorrow”
construction and cheaper to buy,
but can cause a good deal of
trouble. In general, plump for a
four-stroke.
Poisoning Rabbits.
“C.A.A.”: Rabbits will take
poison at any time of the year
despite opinion to the contrary.
Find burrows and feeding-
grounds and between them run a
furrow turned sufficiently to ex-
pose fresh soil. After free-feed-
ing for several nights place the
bait; diced carrot or apple is
recommended. If carrots are
used soak in sugar-syrup to make
them sweeter and damper and
to absorb the poison better. If
baits are set at night and looked
at first thing in the morning there
is minimum danger to stock and
birds.
Fumigation is effective if done
properly. Essential to a good kill
is dogging to ensure that a maxi-
mum number of rabbits take to
their burrows. Then dig to firm
ground before fumigating, stop-
ping all openings and making
sure that sufficient gas is
pumped in to make it lethal.
Plough in treated warrens, as
many small rabbits are got in
this way, either in the inner re-
cesses of warrens to which gas
hasn’t penetrated or outside
through exposure. Frequently
visit old burrows to stop up
holes.
Follow the Directions.
“Nedrium”: Nature is not
easily balked, and the careless
assumption that science solves
all can often be costly. Vic-
torian orchardists at Pakenham
found this out last year when
some of them tried the hormone
spray against pre-harvest fruit
drop. This spray is meant to do
one thing only—hold fruit on
the tree until they are mature.
Some growers, seeing that
apples stayed on the tree so
well, left them on a while after
maturity while prices improved.
Growth of the outer apple layers
increased, so the temptation to
leave the fruit for a while longer
was the greater.
Though most of the fruit was
picked, packed and sold almost
immediately, there was trouble.
Outwardly the buyer saw a
large sound apple, but the inner-
core was found to be black.
There was absolutely no out-
ward sign of this internal
trouble, due to the unnatural
conditions of growth after
maturity.
So anti-drop sprays are for
use only before maturity.
Bone-chewing.
“B.”: When stock take to
chewing bones, wood and other
rubbish it’s because the soil is
short of sufficient lime and phos-
phorus and the stock aren’t
getting minerals from the pas-
ture.
In dairying districts tons of
minerals have been taken from
the soil and nothing put back
into it. Milk yield of bone-
chewing cows is far below that
of cows on good country, and
bone-chewers are not capable of
producing healthy calves.
Every cow needs lime and
phosphoric acid to keep the bone
structure hard. Without them
the bones become soft and
brittle, the joints stiff and swol-
len and the gait is affected.
Calves may be aborted, bom de-
formed or dead. Better pastures
and good licks are the remedy.
Topdress the soil with mineral
manures, increase clover growth
and sow various species of
palatable grasses. Phosphoric
content is seven times higher in
the shoots of young grasses than
in old. That’s why there’s a
heavy consumption of lick when
grass growth is at a standstill.
Farmers like rock-salt because
they can place it in the open and
have done with it. Bigger pro-
fits roll in when troughs are put
under cover from wind and rain
and the cow is given a really
beneficial lick of one part bone-
meal and four parts salt.
A South African experiment
proved that 3oz. of bonemeal
daily stopped bone-chewing and
resulted, in seven months, in an
increase in weight of 671 b. and
m 10 months of 1051 b. over ant
mals not given minerals. On dT
ficient pasture cows i n c J' f
need 240 z, of bonemeal a week
Essential Materials.
, P ut back”: It is remarkable
that, although there is no short-
age overseas of materials
essential for the pastoral indus-
tries, Queensland merchants an.
pear to be reluctant to pl ace
orders with indent - agents
Various reasons are given, such
as fear of losing their quota of
Australian manufactured goods
and price-fixing, which allows no
more profit percentage on im-
ported than on home-manufac-
tured goods. Merchants cannot
be blamed for not bothering to
import goods under such con-
ditions, but if the pastoral in-
dustries of Queensland and the
Northern Territory are to in-
crease production someone will
have to import galvanised-iron,
wire-netting, bore-casing, piping’
rabbit-netting, fencing-wire, etc!
One frequently hears the com-
plaint that imported goods are
too dear, but whereas before the
war a ton of iron
cost the equivalent
of three bales of
wool, a ton of im-
ported iron today
costs the equivalent
of only one and a
half bales of wool.
Most grazing
properties have a lot
of maintenance and
repair work waiting
to be done, and any
money spent on such
work is an allowable
deduction for in-
come-tax purposes.
As landmen are now well
organised, it should be easy for
a group in each district to co-
operate to finance and import
requirements of essential
materials.
Wheat-breeding in Q’land.
“Agric”: A difference of
opinion has arisen between
Queensland Government and
wheatgrowers on the Darling
Downs regarding the dispersal
of wheat-breeding centres. Roy
Perrin, of the Queensland Grain
Growers’ Association, contends
that a wheat-breeding station at
Dalby is urgently needed in view
of the deterioration of present
varieties, and that major wheat-
breeding programmes should not
be concentrated at Warwick
under climatic and soil condi-
tions different from those in the
Dalby district. Acting Minister
for Agriculture Moore says that
dearth of suitable research statt
and expenditure involved in
establishing new rese a r c
materials and facilities wou
not justify new breeding-centres.
Moore contends that experi-
ence has shown that in many
lines of agricultural research it
is best to concentrate basic i
vestigations at a limited num

Country Radio-sets.
“Sarina”: Poor radio recep-
tion after rain is usually caused
by dampness. Moisture gathers
on panels, terminals and wiring
and interferes with the flow of
electricity. In some sets it also
affects the capacity of coils and
condensers, thereby greatly re-
ducing range and volume.
Transformers also are very
easily damaged by damp air.
Much trouble woijld be pre-
vented if all radio-sets could be
run freely during periods of
rain. But country folk with bat-
teries to replace or have re-
charged cannot keep their sets
dry in this way.
Half the battle is to have the
set installed in the driest part of
the house. If it is against the
outer wall of the house more
damp will find its way to it than
if it is set against an inner wall.
It is just as important that the
set be not installed in a very hot
place, for great heat is ruinous
to dry batteries.
During rainy spells a lighted
hurricane-lantern set behind the
set will keep the moisture down
to some extent. Take away the
wet battery whilst the light is
there.
Move the set to a place where
it gets a good measure of sun-
light on the first dry day. If re-
ception has dropped off badly
get the chassis out of the cabinet
and dry damp panels and wires.
The chassis won’t suffer for
being dried for six or eight hours
outside the cabinet. The dry
batteries must not be exposed
to very hot sunlight.
Summer Rains and Wheat.
“He-Ne”: Constant heavy
rains this summer over the
N.S.W. wheat-belf, have inter-
fered with seed-bed preparation
as well as having encouraged
heavy weed-growth. Acreages
may be reduced, because farmers
won’t be able to get into the
paddocks with machines. The
rains have built up soil moisture,
it is true, but heavy weed-growth
will take toll of fertility unless
the weeds can be got at.
There is bound to be sheet
erosion in fallow paddocks;
sheep can’t be put on to boggy
country —as it is, there are bad
outbreaks of footrot, worms and
blowfly attack. April is the seed-
ing month in many districts, and
this year April was just as wet as
February and March.
.Hints for the Farm.
“Baroona”: Secateurs or
pruning,-shears must be really
sharp to do their work properly.
If they do not make a clean cut
sharpen them before using
again; they will damage the
plants if they are used while
blunt.
“Rooster”: May and June are
the months to apply the annual
dressing of organic manure to
asparagus beds. Stable manure
or compost spread in layers
about 4in. thick and lightly
forked or disked under the sur-
face is the ideal quantity. Ip
acid soils a dressing of lime
could be given with advantage
a week or so before applying
the manure.
“Billjim”: Sows which are to
be remated should receive six
gallons of milk per day for the
first month after the litters are
weaned. Give weaners up to
11b. of meal per day, as fast
growth in the earlier stages
means heavier pigs when the
milk-supply fails.
“Sundowner”: If turnips are
to be succulent they must be
grown quickly—in from 45 to 50
days. Heavily manure the beds
and sow thinly |in. deep in rows
12ft. apart and thin later to 3in.
apart. An additional applica-
tion of 2oz. of super, per square
yard will help.
“Metax”: Keep a shallow
layer of oil in the bottom of
the tin in which small drills and
taps are kept and it will save
them from rusting.
“Sarina”: In U.S. apiaries
foul-brood disease is effectively
cleared up by removing infected
bees to fresh hives and feeding,
them honey or syrup-rendered
antiseptic with a little carbolic-
or salicylic - acid. Infected
colonies are sometimes also
sprayed with a mild acid solu-
tion. The disease is readily
recognised because it makes the
bees lazy and listless and causes
an unpleasant odor in the hive.
“Bill C.”: Shorten the outer
leaves of cabbage or turnip
seedlings when transplanting.
The seedlings will then be less
affected by the sun and will root
quicker. About \oz. of blood-
and-bone worked into the soil
in all prepared holes acts as a
great stimulant upon trans-
planted seedlings.
“Soc”; If you’re going to
move your bees about order
deep-cleated lids, similar to
your bottom-boards. Where
the strapping hits in the centre
tack on a 2in. piece of galv.-
iron to protect the timber. The
colonies are so uniform then that
when you get to your next site
and start unloading you’ll find
one or two have done the journey
upside-down. But there’s no
better lid made for loading.

foaming at the mouth and gasp-
ing. Reimer made clucking
noises with his tongue and acted
as if it was a most regrettable
affair. However, when Ingham
asked him if he would help us
give her another injection, he had
no objections, acting in the most
tolerant and broadminded man-
ner imaginable, only shaking his
head from time to time, and
saying “What a pity!”
EARLY in the morning I
heard Ingham get up, so 1
went after him. Judy’s condi-
tion was undoubtedly low. We
gave her another injection,
though I felt it would have been
more merciful to let her die in
peace. Then, when we were
returning mournfully to the
house we heard a cheerful voice
calling, and there was Reimer
driving a cow into our gate.
“He wants to sell you another
cow,” I said to Ingham, with as
much acid in my voice as I could
generate at short notice.
But Reimer shouted “I thought
you’d want some milk while
Judy was sick.”
And he drove the new cow
into Ingham’s bail, got a bucket
and in a few minutes it was full
of milk, though, through his
having milked her so fast, you
couldn’t see how many inches
deep was froth.
“There you are, always gives
a bucket,” he said, “even when
she’s a bit upset from being
driven away from home.”
Ingham looked at all the fresh,
sweet milk, and for the first time
he seemed a little happier. The
new cow was quiet, too, and let
him stroke her along the neck.
WHEN Elliot came later in
the morning Judy was
dead. Ingham was not as upset
as I’d expected, mostly, I think,
because Reimer had acted as if
she was as good as gone ever
since the injections had started.
Elliot was very annoyed with
Reimer, both for being in a
position to blame the penicillin
for killing the cow and for win-
ning Ingham over again. He
dragged the carcass to a remote
part of the farm with his utility
and there he opened it up, deter-
mined to expose Reimer beyond
all excuse. Triumphantly he
pointed to little eruptions on the
organs and small, allegedly
foreign bodies in the intestines.
“She was rotten with parasites
and disease before he sold her
to you,” he declared.
And Ingham looked duly
impressed.
“And don’t let him get at
you again,” Elliot went on. “You
send his other cow back with-
out a ‘Thank-you,’ and come
with me to the sale tomorrow.
I’ll get you a decent cow.”
And he went off, making the
most disgusted" noises.
“I’m sure he means well,”
Ingham confided to me as we
walked home. “But speaking as
man to man, how do we know
that those things he showed us
were really diseases?”
' Then I thought it‘was time I
told him my opinion of Reimer
and his ways.
SO we went with Elliot to the
sale next day. Elliot bustled
about looking minutely at cows
and cross-examining dairymen
about their performances, get-
ting into a great state of neigh-
borly enthusiasm. Finally he
decided on a beautiful red Illa-
warra that looked so productive
with her deep-hanging udder and
glowingly healthy body that
anyone who saw her would want
to own her.
“Whatever you pay for her,
she’s still cheap,” Elliot enthused.
“She’s a genuine eight-gallon
cow. You’ll be able to swim
in milk when you have her.”
Then he was off to have
another word with buyers and
sellers.
Immediately he had gone
Reimer appeared. A look of sur-
prise came over his face at see-
ing Ingham there. Then he be-
came confidential. “Thought I’d
buy a cow today to replace the
one you’re using,” he said.
Ingham was somewhat taken
aback, as if he’d been caught
doing something very mean. He
looked as if he might retreat at
any minute, so I saiS quickly
“You won’t need to replace that
cow, Mr. Reimer. Ingham will
be returning her as soon as he
gets his new one home.”
“Oh, I see,” Reimer replied
as if he’d caught a couple of
conspirators.
Then Ingham rushed to con-
fide about the eight-gallon cow.
Reimer looked interested, but
amused after the manner of a
better-informed man.
“Now what would you do
with eight gallons a day?” he
asked. “That is, if she really
does give eight gallons. You
only want enough to drink.”
“You could make your own
butter,” I suggested to Ingham
to help him out, but Reimer was
running on: “A cow like that
would cost you twenty-five to
thirty pounds, far more than any
sensible man would want to pay
for a drink of milk.”
And he grinned as if he’d
caught Reimer in time to save
him from an egregious folly.
Then he nodded towards Elliot
on the other side of the ring.
“That’s the auctioneer he’s
talking to,” he said, and though
there was really no reason why
Elliot shouldn’t talk to the
auctioneer, Ingham was startled
by the suggestion in, Reimer’s
voice, and immediately he got his
undecided look on his face again.
Reimer stuck close beside Ing-
ham ; but as soon as the sale
started Elliot came and squeezed
himself on the other side.
THE red Illawarra, being one
of the prize offerings, was
soon brought on, and in a few
minutes the bidding ran to
twenty pounds, Elliot shouting
so eagerly on Ingham’s behalf
that Reimer sniggered into his
other ear “They’ll run you for
an extra fiver if he shouts like
that. Better tell him you’ll do
your own bidding.”
And Ingham was so abashed
that he plucked at Elliot’s sleeve
and gave the next bid himself,
a reserved, hesitant nod. The
bidding settled down, and the
auctioneer’s stick was hovering
for the final plunge at £23 10s.
when Elliot, who had been
watching Reimer most suspici-
ously, startled everybody by de.
manding to know who had
the last bid. wno nad made
I think it was mine,” said
Ingham, a bit upset by the seen.
Elliot was making. Cene
But the auctioneer’s bid
catcher asserted that i t iZ,
n mer J . Elliot gave an aS
yell and looked as if he S
going to crack Reimer on thl
nose. But instead he should
Twenty-four pounds on behalf
of Mr. Ingham!” half
And Reimer put on a resigned
smde as he watched the cow
knocked down. But he was still
full of friendliness towards Ins
ham appearing to sympathise
Sir J or . havin B to endure
Elliot s behavior.
“I’U brin g her home for you
with some heifers l’ m buying”
he offered. “That will save you
the cost of a drover.”
And Ingham looked as if he
was more than half ashamed of
himself.
XHE new cow didn’t turn up
1 that day, or the next. But
Reimer arrived when I was hav-
ing my afternoon nap, and when
I woke I saw him talking
earnestly with Ingham in the
pasture, and Ingham was patting
Reimer’s loan cow as if he had
become very much attached to
it. Reimer left when I started
out to join them,
Ingham was evasive about the
business, but as day after day
passed and the red Illawarra
didn’t arrive, I mentioned the
fact to Elliot the next time I saw
him. But Elliot laughed in a
most disillusioned manner.
“Let him have his Reimer,” he
said. “He’ll be happier with him
than with any eight-gallon cow
that was ever calved.”

How was the 9th Div., 2nd A.1.F.,
formed, and how was the shape of
2nd A.I.F. color-patches determined?
In June, 1940, a convoy containing
the 18th Brigade (originally part of
6th Div.) and certain other units
was diverted to England. In England
a second brigade (the 25th) was
formed, and the Australian force,
about two-thirds of a division, played
a part in garrisoning the .country in
the Battle of Britain period. The
Australian Government decided to
increase this force to a full division.
On October 23, 1940, its commander,
Maj.-Gen. H. D. Wynter, became
“G.O.C. 9th Australian Division.”
In the next few months the force
was shipped from England to the
Middle East. There a reorganisation
took place, in the course of which
the 18th and 25th Brigades were
transferred to the 7th Division and
the 20th, 24th and 26th Brigades to
the 9th. The shape of color-patches
in 1940 was derived from those of
divisions of the Ist A.1.F.: Ist,
oblong; 2nd, diamond; 3rd, oval;
4th, circle. Consequently: 6th, ob-
long; 7th, diamond; Bth, oval; 9th,
circle. Because of reorganisation,
this simple plan was later subject to
many modifications.

How was the Australian flag
chosen ?
Soon after the opening of the first
Commonwealth Parliament by the
Duke of Cornwall and York, later
to be King George V, the Melbourne
“Herald” inaugurated a world-wide
contest for a suitable design for a
flag for the young nation. The first
Commonwealth Government raised
the prizemoney to £250, and more
than 30,000 designs were received.
These were displayed to the public at
the Exhibition Building in Melbourne
at a Pageant of Flags opened by the
Countess of Hopetoun, wife of the
first Governor-General, on September
3, 1901, The seven judges appointed
by the Commonwealth Government
unanimously selected the design sub-
mitted by Ivor Evans, a Melbourne
schoolboy, later managing-director of
an old-established firm of flag-makers.
This is the flag in use today. In
1908 a seventh point was added to
the large star in the lower half of
the hoist to represent Commonwealth
territories.

Some particulars about an old-time
"Bulletin” story writer named Perce
Abbott ?
Born Pittsburg (U.S.A.) on Septem-
ber 30, 1859, his father was Scottish
and mother Irish. After a stormy
youth he was trained for the law, but
before serving his articles was offered
the post of U.S. Consul at Dunedin
(N.Z.). Thence went to Fiji as
managing clerk to a solicitor who
was also editor of the Fiji “Gazette.”
He came to N. S. Wales and edited a
Riverina paper. He then travelled
the world for five years, was in
Kimberley the night of the Jameson
raid, made 'a living in London as
paragraphist, songwriter and enter-
tainer, and conducted the orchestra
at Pier Pavilion, Southend. He
returned to Australia, and died in
Melbourne in 1901. He is represented
in The Bulletin Story Book.
* * * *
A few details about the origin of
Canberra ?
The district was discovered by
Charles Throsby in 1821, and settled
by Joshua John Moore and Robert
Campbell in 1823. The whole area
was then called Limestone Plains,
but Moore’s grant was variously
described as “Canbury,” “Canbeiry”
and “Cambury.” All that is definitely
known about the name is that it is
of aboriginal origin. The present
official spelling of the word first
appeared in official documents about
1857. The Yass-Canberra area was
selected for the Aite of the Australian
capital by a* bill which passed the
Commonwealth Parliament in Decem-
ber, 1908. In .1909 the Yass-Canberra
region was surveyed and the actual
Canberra area was pronounced the
most suitable location for the future
capital city.

THE ROOSTER FIGHT.
On vacant land
In a suburban street,
From a barnyard two
Roosters did meet.
They leaped and
Posed to do and dare.
Pounced at each other
And did fiercely spur.
In the combat the
Elder bird did sway.
Fell to the ground in
A exhausted way.
Armed with a broom
A woman hit out
Upon the victor of
The horrid bout.

Communists running Melbourne s

shortage in industry—and used it to the
full. Had times been normal they would
soon have been broke and back to work,
with their claims before the Conciliation
Commissioner.
In the trade-union movement’s happier
days it was an unwritten law among those
who went out that they must not take
other employment while on strike. But
not so with this tram strike. Communist

Tramway Employees’ Association C. L.
O’Shea told the men bluntly the night he
called them out (only half attended the
meeting, the others were working) that
they could expect little from the union
and they would have to obtain employ-
ment elsewhere.
After that trams did not run in Mel-
bourne, and nearly every “trammie
was absorbed in other industries. Most
of them joined other unions, and for all
intents and purposes left the tramways,
but they still attended all the meetings
called by O’Shea to vote for a continu-
ance of the strike.
During two mass meetings (held at
night to make sure the men would attend)
union officers proudly boasted that more
than 85 per cent, of the strikers had
gained other jobs. But still the strike
continued because the men did not feel
any strain.
The tactics of Communist O’Shea have
been most successful, and could easily
be used by other unscrupulous Com-
munists to prolong a struggle and force
an honest employer to yield to their
“demands.” State and Federal Govern-
ments would be wise to give this new
Commo line serious thought, and take
some step to prevent strikers from gain-
ing employment elsewhere. While admit-
ting the Australian worker can please him-
self where he earns his bread and butter,
it’s a bit crook when he goes on strike
in one employment, joins another and
votes to keep the strike going.— Waddlin’
Willie (Vic.).
Industry and the Employer
The average unionist feels helpless
when he reads that the president of his
union threatens a strike. He may not
agree with the president’s views, but he
knows that in a strike he will have no
choice but to stop work. He has no
available means of testing the opinions of
his fellow-unionists, beyond his immediate
workmates, and the fear of - being
accused of “scabbing” kills any desire he
may have to follow his own inclinations.
The aloofness of his employers doesn’t
help. If a real test of strength comes the
employers can help their own case con-
siderably by strongly supporting moves to
oust Communists, and offering their em-
ployees all possible help should they
decide to defy Communist strike orders.
Decent unionists are fed up with con-
tinued use of the strike weapon in Aus r
tralia, and if they had some support on
which to base a unity of purpose em-
ployers might find them on the doorstep
the morning after the union boss said
“Strike! ”
The unionists’ attitude to strikes in the
coming months may well be determined
by the employers’ attitude to unionists.
One thing is certain: The employer
should not be a non-combatant in Aus-
tralia’s industrial war. — Slim Jim (W.A.).
Drovers—a Vanishing Race
A young woman takes the place of her
sick father in droving a large mob of
cattle from Central Australia to Queens-
land. Whether she is moved by adventure
or whether she does it from sheer neces-
sity, because no men are available, the
fact remains that drovers are becoming
increasingly rare.
Any grazier knows the difficulty in-
volved in getting a drover to undertake
a trip, and when one is obtained he is
nearly always an old man. The younger
men just don’t seem to want the work.
To see some of these old-timers one
would wonder how they manage to ride
a horse let alone control large mobs of
cattle for long periods and over all sorts
of country. The fact is, of course, that
they don’t do the jobs properly. They
pan’t, because they are too old. Cattle
are frequently lost and all sorts of mix-
ups occur. The old drovers are not to
blame —they do their best, but it is a
younger man’s job. .
One local (s.w.-Q.) drover, who, with
two other men, is to take a large mob of
steers some 200 miles, is proud of the
fact that he is 76 and father of 25
children. But one wonders if one of the
25 children could not take his place and
give the old chap a bit of a spell. Another
old-timer is stone deaf. He travels with
a young lad who carries a pad and pencil
and writes down anything which anyone
wishes to say to his boss. A younger
man in the district has given up the drov-
ing job because, he says, he can’t get men,
and if he does get them he has to pay
them £lO a week and keep whether they
are on the job or not.
While admiring the spirit of the old
drovers, they have their limitations and
they cannot live for ever. How, then,
are stock going to be moved from place
to place in the future? The general cry
is* for more meat, but to produce meat
stock must be moved to and from the
railheads first to be fattened and later
to be slaughtered. In our district this
problem becomes more and more urgent.
Motor transport seems to be the only
answer, but our Queensland roads will
need to be improved before that is under-
taken to any extent. —G. A. (Q.).
Builders’ Registration
The hairdressers of Queensland want
legislation to enforce registration of all
tonsorial artists. That is probably
necessary, but what about builders?
At present anyone can set up as a
“ Well, if the bridge Wasn't here , where WAS it?"
“builder and contractor.” No law re-
quires the employment of a time-served
carpenter, or demands that the house
shall conform to any standard. With the
hungry demand for anything resembling a
roof, and the availability of “valuers”
who place a steady £l2O per square on
anything with a superficial likeness to a
dwelling, a neat racket is being worked —
particularly in North Queensland.
Ramshackle dwellings, undercutting
reputable builders’ prices, are appearing
in the better-class suburbs, accompanied
by high rentals. The tenants, unwilling <o
improve even the gardens of these houses,
make their homes ugly' blots on other-
wise decent streets, and the jerry-builder
landlord collects the rent, and laughs at
standards of decency. Register the
barbers by all means, but first register the
builders. — Video (Q.).
Wasting the Yanra
Was there ever a great asset to a city
that has been so coiossally mismanaged as
the Yarra? One authority has converted
the part which runs through Melbourne
into a semblance of a main drain with
“beautification” schemes; some other
authority has thrown bridges across it so
low that nothing taller than a raft can
get to its upper reaches. A few miles up
all navigation ceases except for canoes,
and even they have to be portered.
Shark-boats and trawlers which bring
their catches to the city have to discharge
them on one side, of the first bridge and
have them carted to the fish-market a few
yards above it.
Although not a Rhine or Danube, the
Yarra is quite a respectable river by
European standards, and if it were in
Europe it would be locked all along its
length to the foothills and would be
navigable for probably 100 miles for
relatively large craft. I once travelled
400 miles in a luxurious river-
steamer through the heart of Sweden
along a waterway no bigger than
the Yarra, linked with lakes and
canals by dozens of locks which actually
lifted the vessel. over mountains. The
waterway was packed with barges and
trading vessels and must have paid for
itself a thousand times over.
The Yarra has been put so completely
out of commission that nobody even
thought of using it for transport during
the two-months’ tram strike, although
part of it is still capable of serving a
dozen of the inner suburbs. A comic
thing about it is that it has begun to silt
up through disuse and there is no way
in which the authorities can stop the
process because they have built their
bridges so low that they can’t get their
dredges under the first one. — C. Raiser
(Vic.).
Anzac Day
From a sentimental point of view the
holding of Anzac Day holiday on the day
on which it falls is all right, but eco-
nomically it is wrong. In these days any
excuse is good enough for a day off, and
this year many employees failed to turn
up for work on the Monday, preferring
to have a long weekend. In a couple of
years the Anzac Day holiday will fall on
a Thursday, which means that many will
fail to report for work on Friday, thus
having from Wednesday afternoon until
Monday morning as a holiday.
Most of them will lose a day’s pay,
possibly a couple of days, but in these
days of high wages that is a minor
matter; besides, it is so easy to make it
up with overtime. For a long time
Anniversary Day was celebrated on the
day on which it fell, but it was wisely
moved to the first Monday after 26th
January. Moving the Anzac Day holiday
to the following Monday would be a
wise move, and would not affect its
solemnity.—W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
Naval Reservists
“Insubordination of P./o. Brady” by
“Macnell” (B. 12/4/’5O) will have been
read with keen interest by all who served
in the R.A.N. Atmosphere, colloqui-
alisms and the old familiar customs of the
service are exactly right and bring back
nostalgic memories.
To those mature enough to sort out and
balance the impressions gained on service
ashore and afloat, the story has an anti-
reservist undertone, however, which calls
for some comment. Allowing for the
fact that rapid expansion under war con-
ditions made dilution in all rates and
ranks inevitable, it must be conceded that
“hostilities-only” people did a pretty good
job of work. Credit for this, of course,
belongs largely to the naval organisation
and to the trained personnel (“perms”)
who formed the framework upon which
ships’ companies were built. Neverthe-
less, it might well be argued that in many
respects reservists brought with them a
wealth of experience and fresh points of
view which had a beneficial and re-vital-
ising effect on an armed service which
dare not remain static in outlook. These
remarks could even include the gunnery
branch!
So far as officers are concerned, they
usually possessed a reasonable quantity of
O.L.Q. (officer-like qualities) but among
the various braids, i.e., straight, wavy and
criss-cross, there ran the whole gamut of
types, from those with the highest ideals
of devotion to duty to those with the
poorest. Comparisons, therefore, are
odious. The position of Commanding
Officer is a difficult one to fill. The C.O.

Price-control
Though all other States have abolished
price-control on drapery, Queensland re
tains it, a decision having two annoyinc
effects on the Queensland retailer:— b
I—The Queensland retailer is not
allowed the same margin of profit on
drapery lines as the retailer in other
States.
2. —Southern manufacturers of pro-
prietary branded lines are reluctant to
supply Queensland, because they like to
see their goods sell at the one price every-
where, and if they are going to be sold
cheaper in Queensland then they won’t
be made available. It creates an absurd
situation in border towns— Retailer
(Q-).
Teachers and Inspectors
Spare the inspectors a little (B.
19/4/’5O). They are but a part in, and
the victims of, an antiquated system of
education. The inspector of larger schools
has as his guide the assessments formed
on assistant teachers during the year by
the head teacher.
Put a dozen head teachers in a room
and before long the conversation swings
to one thing: “What schools are to be
vacant for head-teacher appointments?
What chance has one against another of
securing the appointment?” For head
teachers have varying cards of efficiency,
even to the extent of decimal places. So
head teachers study the whims of in-
spectors and instil these ideas into their
staffs.
To become a head teacher in Queens-
land in a larger type of school it is neces-
sary to teach for many years in the
smaller one-teacher schools. There is
no promotion from assistant to head
teacher in a large school. He who would
aspire to the head-teachership of a large
school must disappear into the wide-open
spaces, returning later to the long-sought
throne. If this scheme was transferred
to politics it would be first necessary to
be a party branch president before be-
coming Prime Minister. . ~

TALKIES
"We Were Strangers."
The Bulletin admits to arriving a few
minutes late at this film at the Majestic,
Melbourne. Consequently it doesn’t know
what the revolution in Havana was about.
Perhaps, like most revolutions, it wasn’t
about anything, but there was no doubt
about the enthusiasm for it of the prin-
cipal performers, Jennifer Jones, John
Garfield, Ramon Navarro and Gilbert
Roland.
Begrimed from head to foot and
stripped to the waist—all except the lady
—they were digging a tunnel under a
cemetery with the intent, apparently, to
further the cause of liberty and justice by
blowing up all the corpses. This is all
that present commentator could make of
their frenzied activities at that point.
It transpired that their conspiracy was
far more subtle. They’d thought it all
out, and purposed bumping off the Presi-
dent in the reasonable expectation that he
would have a State funeral in. the cemetery
they were undermining and that they
would then be able to blow up all the
corpses, the President’s included, plus the
Government and most of the leading
citizens of Cuba, Their spiritual anguish
when they discovered that the President
had willed that his mortal remains should
be interred elsewhere was touching.
But somehow or other the revolution
happens, the gates of the More swing
open and the people imprisoned by the
late Government emerge, no doubt to
form a new Government which will be
blown up in due course by the late Gov-
ernment in the cause of liberty and justice.
It appears that the picture deals with
an incident in Cuban history and that the
producer intended to make a great drama
°‘ '!■ A touch of humor would have
turned it into a magnificent satire.
"Three Came Home."
In the days of hand-set newspapers
the only difference between pathos and
bathos was a sober compositor. The
boundary-line is still a fine one. No one
can put his finger on the spot where what
nas been fine stirring tragedy suddenly
curdles. “Three Came Home” (Sydney
Lentury) shows that the extremities are
custmet enough.
Plotted on Agnes Keith's book, the film
opens in British North Borneo early in
~ The white people there, diplomatic
aits for the most, are waiting for the
s adow front the north to materialise,
en the Nip arrives, one finds that the
I, „ dlrector ’ Negulesco “Johnny
mda was one of his—has tried hard
t L e audl entic ; all these Japs are not
usual Hollywood wizened chimp-types.
™ e , are more like gorillas. His re-
ipenif s^ps badl y on ly once, with the
afte i tbe Nmth Australian Division
f ree r on S. jungle-fighting arrives in to
a prison-camp not only wearing
freshly-blocked slouch hats, but with
them turned up at the side.
The Nips take the little settlement with-
out a shot, segregate the men from their
wives and children, and bundle them off
into separate camps. There is one par-
ticularly tragic scene of the men help-
lessly watching their families being herded
along a wharf into boats, not knowing
where they are being taken, or what is
in store for them. However, when this
scene is served up again and again with
only minor changes it becomes luke-
warm, cold, defunct and finally emits a
distinct scent.
Sessue Hayakawa, last seen when
theatre pianists pounded out sinister
“mood-music” for his entrances in silents,
turns up here as a reasonably humane
Jap colonel; and for one who is at her
best in comedy, Claudette Colbert hands
in a surprisingly fine piece of acting in
the part of Agnes Keith.
“Three Came Home” has been drawn
out too finely, but although it is not a
superlative film, it comes at a time when
our memories may be fogging, and when
the exponents of “Forgive them every-
thing” may not be getting quite enough
interjections,
"All the King's Men."
Hollywood does best what it does
easiest; not its costly costume-romances,
or its extravagant musicals, but its gang-
ster plays with plush interiors, double-
crossing women, murderers, blackmailers
fixers, bashers—a technique excellently
suited to American politics ; and when to
this is added a first-class novel, tacitly
admitted to be based on the life and death
of Huey (“The Kingfish”) Long, and
when the film’s director, Robert Rossen,
writes the script and keeps it almost the
same as Robert Penn Warren’s novel, it is
not surprising that the result should be
a masterpiece.
The film is also fortunate in having
Broderick Crawford as Willie Stark, the
small farmer with big ideas, who dis-
covers what every man anxious to shine
politically has to learn sooner or later,
that the world is more of a circus than a
debating society. The problem of the
great and good man then becomes how to
turn the circus to his benevolent ends ;
but, alas, poor Willie! he finds he is
being used as a vote-splitter in an election,
has a night on the bottle, and from an
unconvincing lecturer on taxes becomes a
fast-talking rabble-rouser ; and from here
on Crawford gives a persuasive portrait
of his decline from circus-trainer to the
most brutal of its animals ; glib, pig-eyed,
domineering, ruthless, depraved and
murderous.
The part of hostile campaign-follower
changing to secretary, changing to dis-
illusioned and discarded mistress, which
got Mercedes McCambridge her Academy
award, might not have been so import-
ant if she had not made it so, and if it
were not such a shock to find a Hollywood
secretary who could not be mistaken for
Betty Grable; but John Ireland’s part
as reporter turned fact-finder was lessened
by allowing his girl-friend, in love with-
Stark, to betray her uncle, the old judge.
For in the novel it was young Jack
Burden who blackmailed the old judge,
who had been a friend of his family for
years (and was, in fact, his father), into
suicide; and it was Stark’s ability to per-
suade young Jack to do this, an ability
which the author compared with the rare
force of personality of men like Long,
Hitler and Mussolini to make good men
do vile things and like it, which the author
had wanted to emphasise.
However, giving this pretty job to the
girl strengthened the motive of her young
doctor brother for shooting Willie, and
a very neat job he made of it. (Sydney
State.)
Ingrid, Roberto, "Carmela."
If Ingrid Bergman wanted to be a Fatal
Woman, she has succeeded in being fatal
to Roberto Rossellini in “Stromboli”
(Sydney Regent). Any of the short pieces
that make up Rossellini’s “Paisan”
(Sydney Variety) might well be weighed
against Miss Bergman’s whole career—
the negro military policeman acting
“troppo” for the amusement of the Italian
boy, for instance, or the baby wailing
among the dead partisans, or the monks’
horror at learning they were harboring a
Jewish chaplain—in these Rossellini
reminds us, as the Cardamatis production
of “The Sunken Bell” (Sydney Independ-
ent) reminds us, that the lightning-strokes
of art are worth a whole battery of star-
system flashlight-bulbs. So if we must
weep for Ingrid, let us also weep for
Roberto. In trying to make an honest
actress out of a Hollywood star he has
lost his innocence. It is a relief to come
away from this Antony-and-Cleopatra
atmosphere to “Carmela” (Sydney Savoy),
another Italian film, the sentimental story
of a girl deserted by an officer of the
garrison of a prison-island ; she goes mad
and plagues another officer in the delusion
that he is her lover returned ; he pretends
affection in the hope of restoring her
sanity, and falls into the usual trap —at
any rate, Doris Duranti’s person would
make up for a lot of sanity. The film
might be easier to follow if you could
understand all the Italian dialogue, but
one suspects that here the Italians, whose
films have lately seemed almost beyond
criticism, have managed to fail without
even Miss Bergman’s aid.
"The Small Back Room."
This British film at Melbourne
Athenaeum based on a Nigel Balchin
novel is an attempt on the part of
directors Michael Powell and Eme'rich
Pressburger to pot two or three birds with
one barrel. As a documentary of the
activities of the back-room boys who had
the desperate war-time job of working
out antidotes to the latest German dis-
coveries about high explosives, and how
their worst enemies weren’t the Germans
but official red-tape, it is exciting ; and
here Mr. Balchin works from direct
observation, since he was one of the re-
search workers.
Mixed up with it is the psychology of
Sammy (David Farrar) who is in love
with Susan (Kathleen Powell) and divides
his devotion between his work, Susan and
the whisky-bottle. There are indica-
tions that he is sadistic. There are
horrific scenes in which Sammy has his
encounters with whisky and the bottle
grows to titanic proportions and attacks
him.
Having smashed every article of furni-
ture in his flat he goes quietly back to his
work, only to be involved in a furious
encounter with his Susan. These scene
are so horrific that his suicide busines
with a bomb that explodes almost b
being looked at, although really heroic
becomes an anticlimax.
"The Red Danube."
The intransigence of the Russians
occupied Vienna is played to the limit
this M.-G.-M. version of the Bruc
Stewart novel, and skilfully-sustained
suspense and the reasonable logic of th
story do the rest, allied to some worth
while acting, especially from the olde
members of the cast. Ethel: Barrymore’
Mother Superior of the convent which
gives sanctuary to the Russian ballerim
whose repatriation the Soviet authentic
demand is a delicious portrait in which is
blended whimsical humor, deep human
understanding and quiet but inflexible
determination. As the agnostical British
colonel who is charged with the odious
task of handing over the girl along with
other unfortunates to the tender mercies
of the Russians, Walter Pidgeon makes
grim-faced but gentle exchanges with the
Mother and crosses, verbal swords in ic>
politeness with his cynical opposite-
number, whom Louis Calhern makes
quite a nasty type. The encarmined state
of the river, be it noted, is due entirely to
ideology and not to its having been
ignited by the love-interest as expounded
by Janet Leigh and Peter Lawford, At
Sydney St. James.
"Mourning Becomes Electro."
All the gloom of Miss Fitton’s stage
presentation of Eugene O’Neill’s study of
the doom of the House of Mannen is in
this screen transcription at the Savoy,
Melbourne, and Rosalind Russell, Michael
Redgrave, Raymond Douglas and Kirk
Douglas put a similar intensity into their
acting. The audience on the opening
evening had to relieve its tension by
hearty laughter. But it is difficult to see
how O’Neill’s terrific opus could be done
in any different manner.
The motivation of the characters is so
vague as to seem utterly incomprehensible
to an audience of modern people, A wife
hates her husband and worships her half-
brother, a daughter hates her mother and
adores her father and her brother, her
brother loves and hates his father and
mother and is horrified by the feeling he
arouses in his sister, they all feel intoler-
ably guilty about both their loves and
their hatreds, and they are drawn in so
many directions by their conflicting
beliefs and feelings that they are either
half-mad or quite mad, like the brother.
It all becomes so shadowy and compli-
cated that the reasons they give for their
feelings sound comic. The thing lives,
however, and the inference .is not that
O’Neill has merely read into his play
Freud’s famous hypothesis or theory but
that he is either describing something he
has experienced in himself or is giving the
history of an actual South American
family with wtych he had acquaintance.
On their visit to Brisbane, Rockhamp-
ton Little Theatre wasted the talents of
producer Graham McDonald and some
excellent settings, music and lighting, on
Mary Cayley Bell’s “Duet for Two
Hands.” Tom Bencke and Ralph Clay,
with little support from the women of
the cast, did what they could to reconcile
the romance, horror, mystery and incipi-
ent poetry of the piece, but that was not,
and could not have been, enough.
