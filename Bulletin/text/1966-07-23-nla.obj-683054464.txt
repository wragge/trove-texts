Of all the products of Australian vines, none has achieved greater fame than Mildara Sherry. The grapes used are
Palomino, Pedro and Doradillo. Mildara Sherry like many others owes its distinctive taste and bouquet to a secondary
culture of flor yeast. After the flor process, the wines mature in oak casks for many years and are blended in a range of
classic styles to suit different tastes. MILDARA SUPREME DRY SHERRY, the true, pale, dry, delicate style of Spanish Fino,
was first laid down m 1936 and the quality and original unique style have been maintained by the technical staff throughout
the years. It is the finest wine of its type produced in Australia. MILDARA GEORGE DRY SHERRY is of the same quality
as Supreme but of greater age and completely dry. This pale flor-style sherry is free of dextrose and levulose, so interests
people on a non-sugar diet. MILDARA CHESTNUT TEAL, is for those who prefer a delicious full-bodied wine; here is a flor
sherry of the Oloroso style mellow and fruity. Rio VISTA FLOR DRY SHERRY, is a flor Amontillado style but light; a sherry
easi i?- g of flavour and a palate most attractive to the knowledgeable sherry drinker. Rio VISTA MEDIUM
SHERRY, combines the flor character of Rio Vista Dry Sherry with the softness of Rio Vista Cream for those who like
S She -7u y S0ft L not too sweet. Rio VISTA CREAM SHERRY is a true flor sherry with a pleasing sweetness and mellow
finish, with emphasis on the subtle, smooth flavour of the grape.
MILDARA - it makes a host of difference

Rough Justices
Sir,
From time to time—all over Aus-
tralia —newspapers conduct spontaneous,
Sporadic forays at a Judicial System
which permits citizens “of good charac-
ter” usually untrained in the law to sit
in judgment in a number of jurisdic-
tions in suburban Petty Sessions in the
States of Australia other than New
South Wales.
Your contributor Mr. Brian Buckley
(8., July 2) is the latest in the field.
He chose to highlight in his entertaining
article the recent case at Exmouth
(W.A.) of a young law student.
My research into the facts reveals
that the student, after serving 22 days of
a three months’ sentence “wrongly” (as
the Melbourne “Herald” of April 23
last said) imposed by honorary justices
after conviction of “illegal use” of a
truck at Exmouth, can hardly be hap-
pier (on top of all he endured in a
prison at Exmouth) to have His Honor
Mr. Justice D’Arcy at Perth not only
upholding the conviction recorded at
Exmouth but to have superimposed a
fairly substantial penalty of $lOO to
boot.
Considering that, in Victoria, there
are some 8000 Justices of the Peace,
about 40 Stipendiary Magistrates, about
25 County (District) Court Judges, and
about 15 Supreme Court Judges, it is,
surely, a matter for commendation that,
like teenagers, the only time one hears
of the work of JPs is when the odd
case of “rough justice” occurs. Mr.
Buckley is correct when he refers to
the fact that lawyers have their private
ratings of JPs who sit. He omits to point
out the palpable fact that, though, this
“ratings” technique applies right
through the legal gamut —to the Privy
Council, too.
On the question of that notorious
rape case at Camberwell, it is futile for
the Police Association to criticise,
through its Secretary, the low bail of
£5O. For, had the police importuned
for substantial bail (or no bail at all),
then the accused may hot have
absconded. Those granting bail (at all
levels) are reliant upon the police—a<jd
no objection was made at Camberwell
at relevant times to the quantum from
all reports. In my opinion, having been

Photography is still the best way of getting high quality copies
from any document. Photography gives full tonal and colour
values, with clear sharp images. Only the 3M dry photo copy-
ing method uses photography in a fully automatic copier. And
with 3M dry photo-copying there are no messy chemicals,
toners or powders. You get photo sharp prints from any
document, whether printed, typed, written or drawn, whether
black and white or full colour. You can even copy from books.
See the 3M Automatic Dry Photo Copier, in operation at the
3M centre soon.
* There are only nine copying machines on the Aus-
tralian market using no additives, chemicals or toners.
Six of these are made by 3M. Unless you see the 3M range
you aren’t being fair to yourself!

HOSPITALITY PROGRAMME
STARTING IN SEPTEMBER
hauled out of bed now for some 14
years at ungodly hours —with no thanks
at all from an uninformed community—
and with weekly bench service, the JPs
perform not only useful work, but they
do it heroically. Many’s the time in
freezing July do colleagues and myself
cheerfully leave our beds “in the early
hours” to secure the release of persons
apprehended or determine on mental
cases, and so on. Crime, unfortunately,
occurs in “out of office hours” times,
such as Christmas, Easter, weekends,
and night-time, when in fact the “pro-
fessionals” are at their leisure.
Mr. Buckley brings professional
magistrates into his discussion —in
attacking the honorary system (osten-
sibly this is done in the hope that some
will “rub off” sufficiently to bolster his
case against JPs). So that his discursive
article serves only to present a case for
the JPs.
In the Melbourne “Sun” this year a
Stipendiary Magistrate is reported as
having dealt with a company director
on a charge of dangerous driving. He
was told of allegations that the defen-
dant was assaulted by the apprehending
policeman. The report went on to state
that the magistrate, in convicting the
defendant, said: “In all cases before the
court, police evidence is accepted.” I
still have the cutting and, as there was
no retraction as far as I know, I pre-
sume there was no “misreporting” of
the SM. I wrote to the “Sun” and
pointed out that if a JP had said what
the magistrate had reportedly said there
would have been a furore. My letter
was not published. So often do critics
allege JPs say that sort of thing. It
would be an irresponsible maxim “That
police evidence must always be
accepted.” In all my years of court ser-
vice I have yet to experience a review
of any decision I (sitting alone or with
others) have reached—from either a
defendant or the police. That, of course,
may come —it does in all the jurisdic-
tions, too. And that is why our British
system of justice throughout is un-
rivalled.

Crisis at the Cape
Sir,
Much has been written about the
position of this organisation in relation
to North West Cape. Generally this
has been confusing because of the
extremely complex nature of the con-
tract and its conditions, our position
throughout the contract, and the politi-
cal background of the whole venture.
The article in THE BULLETIN, I
believe, told the story of this project
in a simple and straightforward
fashion and, as far as I can see, with
realistic interpretations. In my opinion,
It is a first-class piece of journalism to
be able to tell so simply such a com-
plex story. (8., June 11.)
I believe I should also make the
comment that it is the American
Government rather than the Austra-
lian Government and its Minister for
Defence to whom we must look for an
equitable solutiom

Naughty Geoffrey
Sir,
Geoffrey Dutton really is very
naughty (8., July 9).
I have never expressed distrust of the
ability of Australians to stand on their
own feet—l thought they were already
doing so. I simply maintain it is rub-
bish to believe that abolishing the
monarchy from our constitutions will
abolish the pathetic snobberies asso-
dated with it and that attention should
not be distracte d by this quaint quix-
oticism from much more urgent radical
issues in Australia and outside And l
deplore the overtones of general Anglo-
phobia particularly evident in Donald
Horne’s contribution to the symposium.
The unpalatable truth is that Britain

We apologise for alluding to such an
unpleasant possibility as Death. How-
ever, it is even more heartless to pretend
that the possibility does not exist and
neglect to provide against it. The stern
fact is that most cars have less than half
the safety features of the Rover 2000. You
see above only a dozen of these. We've
listed fifty on a chart we’d be pleased to
send you. In the meantime, have a think
about this: In the event of a collision,
certain things normally tend to happen:
(a) the engine tries to join the driver in
the front seat, (b) the steering column
tries to impale him, (c) the driving cabin
tends to distort, (d) the doors fly open.
The Rover 2000 has been designed ex-
pressly to inhibit these tendencies: (a) on
impact, the engine is encouraged to go
down under the car rather than up into
your lap, (b) the steering column doesn’t
start at the front of the car where a
collision will cause it to spear you; it
starts high up on the bulkhead, out of
harm’s way, (c) the cabin is a rigid steel,
cage, vastly stronger than the usual,
NOT NEXT YEAR
OR THE YEAR AFTER
THIS CAR COULD
SAVE YOUR LIFE
TODAY!
(d) because of the above, the doors are
unlikely to open. These are four of the
fifty reasons why many authorities con-
sider this the safest car in the world.
Happily, its handling, braking and control
are such that the likelihood of accident is
far less to begin with. These are aspects
of the Rover 2000 we would like to demon-
strate to you: the rock-steady ride on all
surfaces, rough or smooth, wet or dry;
the remarkable cornering ability at speed;
the magnificent steering; the incredible
brakes; the extraordinary driving comfort
that banishes another cause of accidents
fatigue. Once you’ve sampled all this,
you may decide to put your life down at
about £l,OOO. That’s about the difference
in pounds between ordinary motoring and
our kind. (We use old currency because
it seems less and people tend to under-
value their lives.) And about that chart.
Please send for it. It gives us quite a
sense of purpose to think we might sell
you a car and also save your life.
Thank you.

Taiwan’s Tourist Boom
Sir,
Your article on travel trade (8., July
9) is incorrect in saying “As far as the
Nationalist Chinese are concerned, once
you have been to Communist China
you are not welcome in Taiwan.”
Visa applicants who have previously
visited the China mainland and other
Communist-controlled countries are
asked to state the nature of such visits
on the application form printed by this
Consulate-General. If they have done
so as tourists they are still welcome to
visit Taiwan. To put the record
straight, I wish also to point out some
figures about the booming tourism in
Taiwan. Nine years ago, in 1956, a total
of 14,974 foreign tourists visited Tai-
wan. Last year the number of tourists
jumped to 133,666, representing a nine-
fold increase. By a latest count the
number of tourists of all nationalities
reached an all-time high of 16,050 in
May, 1966, alone.

The Coolgardie Trap
Sir,
Yes, your correspondent was falling
into a trap (Man on the Land, final
paragraph, 8., July 2), though I didn’t
set it intentionally and I don’t blame
him for falling. I rather admire him for
it.
Who could possibly imagine that
there is much practical significance in
research into the origin of the Cool-
gardie Safe? And who could deny that,
on the face of it, the compilation oi
“accurate, up-to-date, and impartial
statistics” for both the margarine and
dairying industries seems a more worth-
while pursuit? This judgment touches
on questions which are usually, and to
our increasing detriment, put in the
too-hard basket.
Firstly, there is the question of
priorities. Given limited human and
material resources, which jobs are to be
done first? Secondly, there is the ques-
tion of proportions. How much pure
research should be done and how much
applied? How theoretical can we let
how many people get and for how long?
A third problem your correspondent
illustrates is the difficulty of under-
standing the significance of what some-
one else (or even, in the case of pure
research, what oneself) is doing.
Rutherford died believing that his
work would probably never find practi-
cal application. And, to get back to the
Coolgardie, who would guess that this
research is part of a larger project, one
of whose aims is precisely to gain fur-
ther insight into these problems?
The project is, in fact, a study ol
innovation, invention, and scientific dis-
covery in Australia. An attempt is being
made to discover the conditions in
which these take place, both at every
level from innovation to scientific break-
through, and at each stage of our his-
tory from pioneering to present day.
The Coolgardie, of course, represents
the pioneering innovatory class. One
end-result of this study could be to give
some indication of the conditions neces-
sary for our resources of inventive talent
to be used more productively. I guess
this is the sort of thing your Man on
the Land is after, too.

Fuji Electric
Electrical Power for Progress
Electricity plays an important part in
the modernization and the development of
man’s ability to conquer science for indus-
trial growth. Fuji Electric Co., Ltd. is famous
for design and manufacture of modern
equipment to generate and harness electric-
ity, Nature’s greatest gift to mankind!
Australia’s Industrial Potential
The potential growth and development
of Australia’s industry, and the use of her
natural resources are dependent upon the
ability to place unlimited electrical power
at the disposal of industry. Fuji Electric
is aware of the advances Australia has
made in becoming an industrial leader.
Australia has begun an electrical power
modernization program from which she
will emerge as one of the world’s most
progressive and industrialized nations.
Fuji Electric’s Past Contributions to this
Program
We at Fuji Electric have seen the impact
modern electrical power generating equip-
ment has on Australia’s industrial advances.
An example of our contributions to Aus-
tralia’s modern power for progress program
is the huge 950 KW Pelton type water
turbine generator built by Fuji Electric and
installed at the Murray Power Station as a
part of the Snowy Mountains electrical
power modernization program which is
changing the entire future of industry in
Australia.
Fuji Electric’s Place in Australia’s Indus-
trial Future
We have the most advanced research
laboratories and the highest trained crafts-
men anywhere in the electrical equipment
industry. These assets, coupled with mod-
ern facilities and quality controlled pro-
duction techniques, bring an outstanding
quality to every Fuji Electric product
an excellence which will help increase the
industrial growth and economic structure
of Australia. We offer a variety of electrical
power generating equipment to provide
electricity for an entire city or for the
largest industrial facility ever constructed.
No matter what the requirement, our abun-
dant technological knowledge and ability
can design, develop and construct that
equipment.
Fuji Electric, A World Leader In Its Field
For more than 40 years, Fuji Electric’s
products have established the standard of
excellent electrical equipment in Japan and
the world. The quality performance and
high reliability of Fuji Electric products
is backed by the integrity, experience and
skill of more than 18,000 craftsmen who
make up our working force. In addition
to electrical power generating equipment
we hold a leadership position in the fields
of electronics, nuclear research equipment,
and electrical household appliances de-
signed for modern living. We manufacture
everything electrical from mammoth water
turbine power generator to the tiniest
transistor.

The Deposit Gap
Sir,
J. C. Horsfall’s comments (8., June
25) on the Housing Loans Insurance
Corporation do not do justice to that
organisation or to the principle of mort-
gage insurance. A less than twelve
months’ operation, allied to the fact of
the similar service provided by the com
peting privately based body, Mortgage
Guaranty Insurance Corporation of Aus-
tralia Ltd., makes it a little early to
assess the Corporation’s potentialities.
MGICA, which is not restricted as to
interest or amount of loan, has under-
written $ll million in a slightly longer
period, so that a total of $l6 million
of insured loans to date between HLIC
and MGICA is not unimpressive.
These loans are those made for
amounts in excess of lenders’ normal
maximums. In permanent building
societies ordinary maximum is about
75 percent of valuation, and insured
loans extend up to the full 95 per-
cent. The object of assisting credit-
worthy borrowers to overcome the
deposit-gap problem has been achieved
at least in that lenders have been able
to grant these higher loans aggregating
$l6 million, and no misconception
exists about the ability to obtain a
95 percent loan although more could
be known about these benefits in legal
and real estate circles.

Three Cuckolds
Sir,
Madeleine Armstrong (8., July 9)
says that “The Three Cuckolds” gives
some idea what (commedia delVarte)
was like. I feel that she is misled in
this, for “The Three Cuckolds,” with
its careful structure, balance of charac-
ters, witty dialogue, and emphasis on
plot, is more of a commedia erudittia
play. Certainly it is much closer to the
style of Goldoni than to the slapstick
comedy of the original commedia delV-
arte. Mrs. Armstrong would get a
better idea of what commedia delV-
arte was like by watching a Punch and
Judy show or a Mack Sennett film
than by watching “The Three Cuck-
olds,” however admirable Dramsoc’s
production might be.

occurred before.

abolition statute from being presented

Five judges of the N.S.W. Supreme
Court held unanimously that there are
limits to the sovereignty of the N.S.W.
Parliament and that the Court has juris-
diction to prevent the passage of an
unconstitutional statute. They granted
the injunction (Trethowan v. Peden,
volume 31, N.S.W. State Reports, p.
183) and their decision was later up-
held by the High Court of Australia
(Volume 44, Commonwealth Law Re-
ports, p. 394) and by the Privy Council
(1932 Appeal Cases, p. 526). Before he
finally reaches for his pen to wipe out

cations of Trethowan’s case.

In your feature “The Bulletin, 86
Years Ago: July 3, 1880, Hang Ned
Kelly” (8., June 18) it says “Father
Gibbie was the first to enter the burning
house at Glenrowan.” As a matter of
fact, this should have read Father Gib-
ney, a Redemptionist priest, who later
became the fourth Bishop of Perth from
1887 to 1911.

will be found unprepared to
echo the Chancellor’s matured
opinion that “the University of Syd-
ney in its actual circumstances has
become unequal to the wants of the
community.” In colonies such as those
of which the Australian continent is
composed, where society is so widely
different from that which the older
universities draw their graduates, a
departure from the traditional model
is excusable and even necessary. As
colonial society is constituted, it is
the practical, business-loving element
which rises to the surface. But the
keen, hard-headed man of the world
is scarcely the material from which
the enthusiastic and somewhat un-
practical student of letters may be
evoked at will. It is this latter class,
nevertheless, which must necessarily
form the staple of a university, while,
therefore, rigidly conservative regu-
lations are strictly adhered to, it is
evident that for many gerierations to
come until, in fact, society will
have so far solidified itself as to bear
some affinity to that of older coun-
tries the scope of our university’s
usefulness will be much narrowed
down.

More and more airlines are offering the DC-9 and the comfort and convenience you find only on a pure jet.
Whether you travel a little or a lot,
why not be particular and pick a
Douglas DC-8 or DC-9. There are
many good reasons why you should.
For instance, when you select the
new DC-9, you’ll be rewarded with
an entirely new kind of jet travel:
Quick, quiet, comfortable pure-jet
transportation to and from many
places jets could never go before. The
sleek, swift, silent DC-9 is already
one of the all-time success stories in
the history of commercial aircraft.
More than 450 DC-9’s are operating,
ordered, or optioned by airlines
throughout the world and passengers
are already giving it rave notices. Try
a new DC-9 first chance you get.
For longer trips, take the great
Douglas DC-8. The DC-B’s speedy,
stable, smooth, silent flight makes
even the longest trips seem shorter.
Look for a quick, quiet Douglas jet on the
following 50 airlines:

Liberals Who Chicken Out
AT long last there is evidence to
substantiate an old suspicion:
that there is high-level opposition
in the Liberal Party to full-scale
participation in public discussion
of the Government’s Vietnam
policy. It always looked as if this
must be the case, since so few
Liberals came forward to speak
up for the Government at the
teach-ins which swept the universi-
ties last year. Mr. Tom Hughes
and Dr. H. B. Turner were the
only MPs who did so, apart from
Mr. Hasluck himself, just once.
The burden was left to a small
band of non-conforming univer-
sity men and to the DLP.
The evidence is in a letter sent
recently to N.S.W. branch officials
by State Secretary, Mr. J. Carrick.
In the context of a reasonable in-
struction to members not to be
involved in demonstrations or
counter - demonstrations, it said
that the N.S.W. Executive had
decided teach-ins “should not be
encouraged since, in the first
place, they are largely designed to
provide audiences for our oppo-
nents, and secondly, they do not
provide effective opportunities for
our speakers.”
There are, of course, arguments
in favor of the N.S.W. position.
Most of the teach-ins have been
initiated by leftists in universities,
and there were a couple of nasty
little attempts to prevent the Gov-
ernment case being put effectively.
One must also consider the tor-
tuous and crammed format of the
teach-in: hour after hour of argu-
ment and counter-argument dulls
the neutral mind and leaves
doubt. Since Government policy is
a positive one of involvement,
whereas the Opposition wants only
non-involvement, the format of the
teach-in may be prejudiced against
the affirmative speakers.
But these are unpersuasive
arguments for the sort of general
discouragement the N.S.W party
orders. Where leftist manipulation
has occurred, it has been relatively
unimportant. Those who initiated
the teach-ins have generally al-
lowed the organising committee to
be politically balanced, making it
easier to resist and, if necessary,
expose misconduct. Besides, the
case for our commitment to
Vietnam is so sound that when
properly put, even to a hostile
audience, it makes the inevitable
impact. Finally, it would be a
definite asset for the Opposition
if it got around that Liberals are
not prepared to debate their case.
It remains true that there is a
serious problem posed by organised
disruption. At least five Cabinet
Ministers who have spoken on
Vietnam at recent public meetings
have just not been able to make
themselves heard above the bedlam
of hysterical leftists. But it is
ironical that this has happened
mainly at Liberal Party meetings,
not at teach-ins.

THIS AUSTRALIA
The Mouse that Roared
IN Washington last week Harold Holt had an experience unique for an Australian
Prime Minister. As Holt accurately said, Australia, small and undeveloped,
was a mouse alongside the United States, the greatest military power the
world has seen.
But the mouse speaking with the
voice of Holt gave the lion encourage-
ment at a moment it needed encourage-
ment. Much more importantly it per-
suaded the lion to adopt the mouse
viewpoint.
An odd feature of Holt’s mission was
that from the outset Holt had a
genuine fear that the United States
might contemplate withdrawal from
Vietnam. If it withdrew from Vietnam
it might be shocked by its loss of
prestige and in shock decide to go
further and withdraw from South-East
Asia into a form of partial isolationism
that acknowledged responsibilities only
for Europe and let the rest of non-
Communist world go by default.
In some ways it is difficult to see
how Holt acquired this fear. It may
have been that he felt that public
opinion in the U.S. might force a with-
drawal. Public opinion in the U.S.
operates more powerfully upon foreign
policy than it does in most parlia-
mentary-governed countries and there
is no doubt that a section of public
opinion feels that the U.S. in Vietnam
has got itself into a hopeless mess
from which it can extricate itself only
by what will amount to virtual with-
drawal.
This fear came through in the
manner in which Holt continually
blasted at the lack of information about
the war in the U.S. He claimed the
Americans were being presented with
a negative picture which suggested that
the U.S. was fighting a tough, costly
war without seeming to achieve any-
thing worth while. But they were not
being told of the positive side, that
behind the shield of U.S. strength in
the area the non-Communist countries
were strengthening their economies and
moving toward a position of co-
operation that within a discernible
period could produce a developing,
politically stable non-Communist area
in South-East Asia in which living
standards were rising and would rise
further and where the challenge of
Communism could be met and over-
whelmingly rejected.
Possibly this fear was unreal. But
the American lion needed some en-
couragement and it got it from the
mouse of Australia. Holt not only said
the U.S. policy was right but gave
reasons why it was right. And in doing
so he secured a changed emphasis in
U.S. policy in the area. Whereas pre-
viously the U.S. concentrated merely
on saying it would not be defeated,
Johnson accepted Holt’s theme and be-
gan explaining not only that the U.S.
would not be defeated but how it
would be victorious. It would be vic-
torious by intensifying the develop-
ment of a new prosperous Asia behind
the shield of the U.S. presence.
More clearly than ever Holt has now
indicated his private belief that it is
only a matter of time before Britain
pulls out of South-East Asia as a
significant power. This is what lies
behind his reference to the disap-
pointment he had in Britain on this
Holt and Johnson —a new Asian Alliance?
subject even though he had to be polite
and say he was encouraged by Wilson's
personal determination that Britain
should remain in the area as a mili-
tary force.
Holt was a tired bleary-eyed man
after two 22-hour days and little sleep
when he reached Honolulu. But he
must have felt that it was well worth
while. Only the future will tell whether
Holt’s analysis of the Asian situation k
sound or a tribute to his optimism
rather than his judgment.
For this is the key. It is upon his
analysis that Holt bases his approach
and in turn has influenced the Ameri-
can approach to a new Asia.
ALAN REID
Greedy Airlines
THE airline industry is passing into
a greedy period: TAA and Ansett
ANA both want bigger cuts of the
business, and their employees are not
only demanding higher handouts but,
as has recently been demonstrated, are
prepared to let internal air services go
hang unless they get them.
“Competition” has also become a
clean word again in political and
economic discussion. In the internal air-
line industry both Sir Giles Chippindall,
the outgoing Chairman of TAA, and
Mr. Reg Ansett want more of it, the
major difference between them being
the former’s continued insistence that
the Government operates its two airline
policy to TAA’s competitive disadvan-
tage. On the narrow ground that the
rationalisation of services and Mr.
Ansett’s takeovers of various intra-State
airlines appear to have restricted TAA’s
scope for expansion, this is as true as
it is natural for bureaucratically and
socialistically minded people to get
worked up about it. There are no abso-
lutes in this argument. If Mr. Calwell
was in power the balance would be
swung toward TAA and Mr. Ansett
would be the one complaining. The
bigger national question is not whether
Ansett is selling too much and TAA
too little (both are heavily subsidised
by the Government, so competition is
prostituted, anyway) but whether the
two-airline policy is being operated to
the best advantage of the country as a
whole.
Above all, the aim should be
rationalisation Hot only of services for
the best deployment of resources within
the industry but also in the allocation
of resources and priorities. If the par-
ticipants between them cannot give the
country the internal air services and
facilities required, they must be subsi
dised. If on top of that, rationalisation
is best served by maximising competi-
tion, even say to the extent of giving
free rein to IPEC and others in the
freight field, then let us have more
competition (so long as the pretence is
dropped that either of the present two
airlines is standing on its feet).

The Unruly Bishops
THE major obstacle to State Aid for the Roman Catholic sector of the
independent schools in New South Wales is not the alleged anti-Catholicism
of the electorate, but the failure of the Catholic Bishops to agree upon what
form this aid should take.
It is true that in the middle 1950 s
all the Catholic Bishops of Australia
did agree upon a common plan that
was presented to the governments of
the time, but the political climate at
the time was not favorable. This plan
was something like the present hospital
scheme. The grant would be invested
in the child, whose parents or guardians
would then sign a document authorising
the school of their choice to collect
the grant on behalf of the child.
However, the Bishops of N.S.W.
never did put this proposition to any
N.S.W. Gdvernment. Cardinal Gilroy,
together with the then Bishop Carroll,
did put a proposition to Mr. Heffron,
to which neither Mr. Heffron nor his
Government made any reply for nearly
two years, and then it was a negative
one. This particular approach was made
on behalf of the Archdiocese of Sydney,
and was perhaps motivated by the fear,
in Sydney, that the recently formed
movement in Goulburn, as the result
of the “School Strike” in that city,
might become a mass movement of
lay-people over which the Bishops
would have little or no control.
More recently the Archdiocese of
Sydney has asked the Government of
N.S.W. for three things: (a) training
of Catholic lay-teachers in State train-
ing colleges, or in similar institutions
approved by the State; (b) payment
of the salaries of lay-teachers in its
school; (c) an increase of the State
allowances paid to those children whose
parents qualify for them by submitting
to a means test. This request was
turned down by the Government, not
because they were in themselves un-
reasonable, but precisely because the
Government refuses to regard the
Archdiocese of Sydney as the spokes-
man for the rest of the Catholic
Church in N.S.W.
Other Bishops of N.S.W. have been
in touch with the Government, also.
Some of them want all the qualified
teachers in their schools to be paid by
the State; others want a per capita
grant; still others, an undertaking by
the State to build schools for them.
Since each Bishop is autonomous in his
own diocese, it is, of course, obvious
that individual personalities, not to
mention political differences, make
agreement between the Bishops rather
problematical.
Accentuating the differences be-
tween the Bishops is the fact that the
Archdiocese of Sydney is educating
60 percent of all the Catholic children
attending Catholic schools in N.S.W.,
and the that Sydney has spent
millions of dollars in reorganising its
school system. Without the co-opera-
tion of Sydney, the rest of the Bishops
realise that they have little, if any,
chance of being heard by the State
Government.
However, Sydney, as well as the
other eight dioceses in N.S.W., may
well be facing a crisis which could
result in the complete breakdown of
the Catholic sector of the independent
schools, with obvious disastrous results
to the State schools. Many of the
dioceses in N.S.W. will almost cer-
tainly have to raise school fees to a
level which will be beyond the capa-
city of their lower income groups to
pay.
It is fair comment that Bishop Mul-
doon’s subsequent railings against what
he considered to be the injustice of
the State toward the independent
schools would have much more real
force if he could prove that the
Bishops had made a united and
reasonable approach to the Govern-
ment, and had been rejected.
The thing that strikes most Catholics
is that in the one case, where the
Bishop was really accepted by the
Government as the official spokesman,
there were very beneficial results.
Archbishop E. M. O’Brien, of Can-
berra, successfully negotiated with the
Menzies-Fadden Government for aid
for his schools in the A.C.T. First of
all he obtained an agreement by the
Federal Government to pay 5 percent
interest on all approved loans for the
building of new schools; and more
recently, an agreement to build all
future Catholic schools in that terri-
tory.
Dr. O’Brien regarded this whole
question as one of economics. The
economics are just as valid for the
State of N.S.W. It can be statistically
demonstrated that to educate the
Catholic children in the eight dioceses
of N.S.W. (i.e., excluding Sydney) in
State schools at $260 per head, would
cost the State $17,680,000 per year.
Catholic schools could carry on at say
$4O per head, which would represent
a saving to the State of $l5 million.
This does not mean that $4O per head
is the cost of educating Catholic school
children, but that amount would enable
Catholics to keep their schools open,
and to be real partners with the State
in education.
As far as lay people in the Catholic
church are concerned, they are dis-
tressed by three things: (1) The failure
of the Bishops to agree on a united
proposition to the State; (2) Their
lack of leadership; (3) The failure of
the Bishops to take lay people into
their confidence about current or pro-
posed negotiations with the Govern-
ment.


a great moment
for all
whisky
drinkers
Connoisseurs are aware of the vital part grain plays in pro-
ducing a fine, smooth whisky. Australian barley, grown
under ideal climatic conditions, has reached such high
quality that it is now recognised internationally for its
superb whisky-producing qualities. This is important for
Australia; it is important for the entire Australian Whisky
industry. For the first time our modern distilleries, with
their highly skilled blenders and strict quality controls, are
now able to create smooth, matured whiskies of truly
unique character.
This is the era when Australian Whisky has achieved full
international recognition—so much so that it is being
sought in increasing quantities by overseas countries.
Connoisseurs are already celebrating this new era. Why
not join in and enjoy a nip or two tonight? You’ll be
pleasantly surprised.
Safety Fast
A FEW years ago a shiny auto-
mobile of pleasant design and
surging power was on sale on the
Australian market. It could be bought
with a complete range of extras akd
„.. v „ i r . .. , i i , ,
additives but it could not be bought
wi sa e s eering. .
A fault in the design of the steering
mechanism was responsible for the
development of a dangerous slackness
after about 10,000 miles. Just as the
car was fully run in and generating
huge bursts of brake horsepower, the
driver found himself unable to keep

and fault of this car were well known
i n the motor trade it seemed that until
very recently nobody cared,
The sharp acceleration in public con-
cern for high safety standards in car
manufacture has followed the investiga-
tions and revelations of the United
States Senate Commerce Committee
and of one of its chief witnesses, Ralph
Nader, author of “Unsafe at Any
Speed.” The strong man of the Senate
Commerce Committee, Senator Ribi-
coff, insisted that General Motors,
Chrysler, Ford, and American Motors
provide a catalogue of all the secret
defects in their vehicles since 1960.
The manufacturers protested, but com-
plied. Their embarrassment was made
worse when General Motors recalled
more than a million Chevrolets and
the Chrysler Corporation recalled
17,000 Dodges for safety modifications
during the Senate hearings.
The safety proposals of the United
States Senate have now been studied
by the Victorian Government, and last
week the Acting Chief Secretary, Mr.
Manson, announced that Cabinet was
preparing new legislation to raise the
safety standards of cars sold in the
State.
The legislation will cover five major
points, which the Government did not
at first reveal. It is understood, how-
ever, that panel instruments and con-
trols, steering columns, door latches,
and hinges, tyres and wheel runs, and
fuel tanks and pipelines, seat belts, and
brakes have been studied by the Vic-
torian Cabinet, and the legislation will
try to establish higher safety standards
for most of them. The legislation will
take effect in two or three years.
ir fHE day before Victoria announced
its decision, the Commonwealth
Government formed the Motor Vehicle
Design Advisory Panel to investigate
methods of making cars safer.
It is under the chairmanship of the
Controller of the Land Transport Sec-
tion of the Department of Shipping and
Transport, Mr. J. H. W. Permezel.
Spokesmen for the motor manufac-
turers were quick to criticise the Vic-
torian move for unilateral action.
General Motors-Holden’s said that it
was in favor of moves to set higher stan-
dards of safety, but complained that
independent action by the States was
unnecessary and undesirable. This view
was supported by the N.S.W. Minister
for Transport, Mr. Morris, who said
that uniform legislation should be
passed in all States and that the issue
was a national one.
The Victorian Government has a
notion that it will supply a lead to the
other States and will spur the Common-
wealth Advisory Panel into quicker
action, but the motor industry declares
that independent legislation in the
various States could make it very diffi-
cult for car makers and distributors to
comply with safety standards.
The problems of hasty action were
instanced a couple of years ago in
Western Australia when State Cabinet
at Christmas announced that all cars
sold from early January onward would
have to be fitted with windscreen
washers. The motor trade replied to
this sudden announcement that it would

be impossible to comply with these
regulations for some months and the
Western Australian Cabinet quietly
changed the timetable.
Late last week the Victorian Govern-
ment, through the Acting-Transport
Minister, Mr. Hamer, told a con-
ference of State and Federal Transport
Ministers the details of his proposed
legislation. He had already declared
that his Government would proceed
with its laws irrespective of whether
the States and the Commonwealth
agree to pass similar legislation. In fact,
the Victorian Government’s plans were
endorsed by the conference and there
was general agreement that uniform
action ought to be taken.
The Murrumbidgee Moonshiners
LAST week’s move into the Muri*umbidgee irrigation area by Government excise
inspectors looking for illicit liquor stills was preceded by several develop-
ments in this off-beat and little-publicised industry.
In Victoria, where most of the illicit
activity has gone on in the past,
excise investigators noticed that
the unofficial ruling price for this sort
of grog has risen from 9/- a bottle
three years ago to 17/-, indicating some
step-up in demand. This came with an
increase also in their uncovering of
illicit stills in Victoria; their tally has
been 110 stills in the past five years,
but 23 in the past three months. Past
practice, they knew, confined illegal
distillers just to making the stuff for
themselves with a slight overflow dis-
tributed among neighbors, friends, or in
small local clubs. But increasingly big-
ger stills were unearthed. One had
been turning out a whopping 750 gal-
lons a week. Another was so big it

figure so largely and it is inaccurate
to blame only Southern Italians as most
have been found doing it because
it is a fairly regular custom in most
European countries.
Australian Customs are harder for
several reasons. For one thing, they
just do not like the business. They and
the local liquor producers and traders
do not want to see it flourish in a free
atmosphere. Health hazards come into
it because of the crude, often dirty,
uninspected equipment used and the
continuing temptation on makers to
turn out stuff of increasing potency for
a commensurately more satisfied mar-
ket. Then there are always the tempta-
tions for the gangster element to move
in, resulting in an unwantedly danger-
ous new by-product.
The liquors most favored in this sort
of manufacture are grappa, rakia,
schnapps, and slivovitz. Production
principles in home stills are the
simplest: the brew is boiled in an en-
closed container from which the steam
is run off in tubes that are water-
cooled in an adjoining container to
emit finally, in liquid form, an end
product of sometimes mammoth
potency. The Melbourne Customs
House haul of such stills is quaintly
varied. Copper laundry tubs are favor-
ites, as are 44-gallon drums, buckets,
and paint tins. But there is also one
large milk can, one old fire extin-
guisher, a former oxygen holder, and
even an ordinary pressure cooker in
which a female offender boiled up
cherries for weeks on her home stove
to yield a hard-won 60 gallons of grog.
As well as wine and grapes as base
commodities, fruits are fairly common
apples, pears, plums, apricots.
Potato peelings are rare, but any-
thing that ferments will do. Sugar
added helps the process efficiently.
One producer just kept on boiling up
sugar and water.
Fines are tough: up to $lOOO. But
second offenders are frequent. The ex-
cise men can seize not only stills and
liquor from them but also anything
used to carry it. One distiller lost his
car that way. At best, officialdom ack-
nowledges it can never completely
stamp out the practice, but continuous
hard investigation and cracking down
can diminish it.

SIR WILLIAM SPOONER, who
died in Sydney last week aged
68, though for so many years
familiar in politics, was not a political
type. He cared little for the limelight
and showed no disposition to advance
himself.
His political behaviour was in tune
with his whole history. He enlisted in
the Ist AIF just after he was 18 years
old, served in the Australian Field
Ambulance in France, was wounded at
Ypres, won a Military Medal, trans-
ferred to the Australian Flying Corps,
came home, and sank back into civil


life, and about the only thing that re-
minded anybody that he had been a
serving soldier was his interest in Syd-
ney Legacy, of which he was president

From then onward he was one of
the enigmas of politics. He was never
a private member. He stepped straight
mto the Ministry of Social Services
without getting excited about it He
took over the Ministry of National
Development less than 18 months later
and achieved a record unbeaten by
anybody except the Prime Minister: He
held the one office continuously for
14 years, weathering a period in which
there was more industrial and commer-
cial development in Australia than in
any other 30 years of Commonwealth
history. He was undoubtedly the min-
isterial father of the great mining indus-
try of today.
The strange thing was that every-
thing coming under his ministerial
hand seemed to do well, although no-
body, least of all himself, gave him
credit for it.
The Joint Coal Board was an in-
stance. Founded before his time, it

As it was, his period saw industrial
peace established on the fields, the
industry mechanised, full employment,
sub-standard coal towns brought up to
standard, the export trade built to a
record level, and coal prices reduced
despite huge increases in wages. He
graduated to the Government leader-
ship of the Senate late in the 1950 s and
made no name for himself. He was

to the illness which struck him

had been aDDointed a KCMG in 1963

de Gaulle
By DOUGLAS JOHNSON
Douglas Johnson is Professor of Mod-
ern History at the University of Birm-
ingham.
GENERAL DE GAULLE breaking
up the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation; General de Gaulle
as the privileged guest of Moscow;
General de Gaulle recognising Com-
munist China', condemning the Ameri-
can policy in Vietnam and offering to
mediate there as he prepares to explode
a bomb in Tahiti; the phenomenon con-
tinues. Much has been written about
the General and yet the fundamental
questions remain. Can one take the
General seriously?
Has he a world influence, are his
actions important, is he the subject of
great preoccupation in Washington, in
Moscow, and in Peking? Some say that
he lives a Walter Mitty existence, that
he has no real power. His bomb is only
a “bombette” and he is only a skilful
pretender in an age of pretence. But
he had few forces when he came to
England in 1940, and he did not make
many friends or allies, since he quar-
relled both with Roosevelt and with
Churchill; yet from 1940 to 1945 he
was highly successful. Others admit de
Gaulle’s successes, but refuse to see any
deep significance in them. There is no
such thing as Gaullism, there is only
de Gaulle. Gaullism can only exist
for as long as the General lives, and
he is as old as the Eiffel Tower. Already
in Paris the word has gone round that
the politicians are preparing for the
period of “l’apres-gaullisme.” Already
it is suggested that this will open with
a break between Pompidou and Debre
and that this will be the end of Gaul-
lism, whether in terms of European
defence, of relations between East and
West, or of attitudes toward America.
But even those who say this sometimes
have their doubts.
Just as some Americans have begun
to wonder whether the General is mor-
tal after all, so some begin to believe
that his long, ungainly shadow will con-
tinue to fall over world affairs, even
when he is entombed in the Wagnerian
splendors of the Mont-Valerien. How
then can one understand this pheno-
menon? How can one bring de Gaulle
and Gaullism within one’s rational com-
pass? The usual way has been to think
in terms of the person. But this has not
been very successful. Looked at in one
way de Gaulle is attractive. He is
honest, simple, tolerant, and humane.
He is highly cultivated and his conver-
sation can be entertaining and brilliant.
Everything about him is interesting. He
is the supreme contradiction to the say-
ing “the bigger the gun, the bigger
the bore.” But looked at in another
way he is less attractive. “When General
de Gaulle wishes to consult the map of
France he looks in a mirror.” His
egoism, his conviction that he is France,
his view of history on such a gigantic
scale that a thousand ages in his sight
are like an evening past can be made
to appear ludicrous. It was said that
Madame de Pompadour used to call
Louis XV “France” even when they
were in bed together. For any living
man so to exalt himself as to identify
himself with an emotional concept, “la
France,” is to present a picture which
is laughable, or disagreeable, or both.
approach is to consider
the General as a politician; as a
statesman whose actions and activities
must be analysed and appraised. But
once again this is not entirely satis-
factory. One can point to successes.
One can show how, on a number
of occasions, the General has im-
posed his own rhythm on events,
like an orchestral conductor. In 1940,
France was defeated; the General in-
sisted that the war was a world-wide war
in which France, through her empire,
still had a role to play and allies to
win. In 1945 liberated France had to
envisage the possibility of Communist
revolution; de Gaulle went to Moscow
and transformed himself into the ally
of Stalin. In 1958 a howling mob in
Algiers posed the issue of whether
Algeria would remain French; de
Gaulle elevated the question into that
of the renovation of France. But equally
one could suggest that de Gaulle has
never done anything. Under the Third
Republic he failed to convince his
fellow-soldiers about mechanised armies
and he himself failed to understand the
use of air-power. Under the Fourth
Republic he failed to stop inflation and
he allowed the war in Indo-China to
develop. Under the Fifth Republic he
has abandoned Africa, he has allowed
a number of business interests to
become powerful, and he has avoided
any attempt at social reform. Once


the road
to Tahiti
again the most contradictory attitudes
can be maintained.
There can be little doubt that one
does not understand Gaullism either in
terms of the General’s personality or in
terms of his actions. It is curious that
more attention has not been paid to his
ideas. For throughout his career General
de Gaulle has been a soldier who has
been a writer and a speechmaker. Before
the war he wrote several books, includ-
ing an analysis of the reasons for Ger-
many’s defeat in 1918, which set for-
ward a number of interesting ideas con-
cerning both defence and politics. Dur-
ing the war de Gaulle had little with
which to make his influence felt other
than the spoken or the written word.
It was with his Memoirs, written during
his retirement in eastern France, that
his reputation began to recover again.
Since 1958 his television appearances
and his Press conferences have been
amongst his most effective weapons.
The General, that is to say, has
always been concerned with words. And
it is not as a spell-binder that he uses
words. His speeches are invariably care-
fully prepared and memorised (one of
the several ways in which Churchill is
to be compared to de Gaulle). His use
of French is distinguished and can be
impressive. He has the gift of using
telling and impressive phrases. But de
Gaulle does not speak in order to
hypnotise or to move his audience. He
speaks (and he used to write) because
he has certain things to say. And it is
not surprising that his speeches should
often appear repetitive, or that to those
following de Gaulle on one of his tours
of French regions the speeches should
sometimes seem empty, since de Gaulle
is always putting forward a limited
number of ideas.
It is curious that his actions should
occasion surprise, since if one looks at
his speeches or his writings, one often
finds them announced a long time in
advance. For example, the present con-
tribution of France was sketched out in
general terms in the Bayeux speech of
June 16, 1946. The present policy
toward Moscow was heralded in Octo-
ber, 1944, when de Gaulle described as
“nonsense” any attempt to cut one part
of Europe off from another, and in his
Memoirs he wrote off an association of
peoples, “from Gibraltar to the Urals.”
In countless writings and speeches he
has described the theory of leadership
which he now incarnates. Indeed, it is
difficult to find anything surprising in
de Gaulle, since his actions seem to fit
normally into the framework of a fairly
simple intellectual system.
What then are these ideas which form
the basis of Gaullism? The first and
most obvious is his belief that it is the
nation-state which is the basis of politi-
cal action.
Nations exist and they are rooted in
history. Political ideologies, such as
Communism, are not as powerful as the
nation-state. Communism will fade
away, or it will change, or it can be
accommodated. But the nation-state
will remain. National leaders such as
Roosevelt or Churchill may surround
their policies with a certain idealistic
phraseology, but they will be concerned
with trying to advance the interests and
the power of their own countries. In a
similar way de Gaulle himself will
always try to strengthen the inter-
national position of France, whether by
a particular defence policy or by a
particular approach to other nation-
states.
It is this nationalism which has been
the most derided and criticised of the
General’s ideas. De Gaulle, it is said,
is an anachronism because he puts for-
ward this conception of the nation-state
at the very time that the nation-state
has become out of date. Because of the
expense and the complexity of modern
weapons it is not possible for a single
State to organise its own defence. How,
asks the former Prime Minister, M.
Pleven, is it possible for France to
defend herself without a radar screen
which involves a whole international
organisation? And equally, it is asked,
how can one talk of the independence
of a country when every country is
economically dependent upon all the
others?'
But there are a number of observa-
tions which can usefully be made. To
begin with, the evolution of the world
since the war does not suggest that
nationalism is an out-of-date concept.
The emergence of the power blocs has
been a national rather than an ideolo-
gical one. American and Russian influ-
ence has been associated with their
greatness as nation-states rather than
their championing of particular ideolo-
gies.
The evolution of international Com-
munism has confirmed this. One may
dismiss the concept of “France” as
something which is purely emotional.
But is the word “Communism” any
more precise or any less emotional? It
comes as no surprise to de Gaulle that
there should be differences between the
Russians and the Chinese as leaders of
Communism.
Russia (and the General always pre-
fers to talk about “Russia” rather than
Use the phrase “the Soviet Union”) is
different, both nationally and histori-
cally, from China, “that old country
which is older than history itself,” and
therefore their ideologies will be dif-
ferent. The political evolution of Africa
and of Asia has also seen the triumph
of different nationalisms. Movements
such as the Pan-African movement have
hardly been successful, just as, in the
world itself, the United Nations
Organisation has hardly become a
dominant force. Thus it would be wrong
to suppose that nationalism is out-
dated.
On the contrary, the General could
claim that his concept of the nation-
state has allowed him to be on the side
of history. New nation-states can come
into being. It seems unlikely that de
Gaulle ever had much faith in the per-
manence of French Algeria, or in the
success of much of French Africa. He
was not prepared for France to be
ousted by other countries, such as
America or Britain. But once he saw
the emergence of a new nation, of an
Algerian Algeria, then he was prepared
to accept the independence of that
Algeria as national. When he goes to
Latin America and harangues the
crowds he believes that he is supporting
a movement within these countries for
effective independence from American
influence. When he accords diplomatic
recognition to Communist China he is
recognising the existence not of an
ideology but of a national reality.
JN the same way, de Gaulle finds him-
self amongst the “Liberals” in his
approach to the Vietnamese situation.
The Americans, he claims, are fighting
“a filthy war” in Vietnam. This is
because American intervention is con-
trary to the principle of the nation-
state, and the ending of French rule
in Indo-China meant the emergence of
national identities, not the substitution
of one colonial ruler for another. But,
more important, according to de
Gaulle, the Americans are fighting a
myth in Vietnam. There is no such
thing as international Communism.
It is not true to say that if a certain
area of South-East Asia falls to Com-
munism then there will be a wholesale
victory for the ideology against which
the Americans are committed. Just as
in Europe one has seen the emergence
of a Rumanian Communism, as well
as a Russian Communism, so in Asia
one will see the development of
similar diversities. Just as in Europe
there is no reason why one should not
negotiate with a Communist govern-
ment if it is convenient, so in Asia one
can negotiate. One can suggest that de
Gaulle is wrong in his appraisal of the
situation. But it is difficult to reject
altogether the notion that the dangers
to world peace come from national,
rather than from ideological, aspira-
tions. It is certainly unwise to dismiss
this attitude as out-of-date.
The second principle of Gaullism is
the need for a strong State. This is of
particular relevance to France, but it
is linked with de Gaulle’s belief that
the whole of modern existence spells
danger and that the whole of con-
temporary developments is to increase
that danger. Both the supporters and
the opponents of the General associate
him with crisis and with disaster.
France, he maintains, is in constant

danger of sudden death, and therefore
must have some permanent authority
which can take the necessary decisions
and some independent force which can
defend the country. Whether the exist-
ence of such an authority is in accord-
ance with certain theories of govern-
ment is immaterial.
The demands of internal and inter-
national politics concur in creating a
certain type of French State, which has
to be both strong and independent.
“Politics is action,” the General has
said, “an ensemble of decisions which
are made, things which are done, risks
which are taken.” This being so, the
government of a country cannot be
entrusted to an assembly. An assembly
exists for debate and for deliberation, it
does not exist in order to take decisions.
And, therefore, although the General
would undoubtedly have made a for-
midable parliamentary figure, and
although there is some reason to believe
that he was attracted to the life of the
Chamber, he has always shown a con-
tempt for political parties and a deter-
mination not to allow too much im-
portance to either of the Assemblies.
It is interesting to see that de Gaulle
has not been criticised for this as much
as might have been expected. The main
criticism, or fear, is that his disregard
of party organisation is bound to
weaken Gaullism when he is no longer
there. Some believe that a well-
established Gaullist party would be the
best guarantee of the survival of the
Fifth Republic. But usually there is
approval, and many of those who
oppose de Gaulle claim that they would
preserve the institutions which he has
created. It is difficult to accuse the
General of being old-fashioned in this
respect. Surrounded by an apparently
efficient, team of advisers, many of them
young men recruited from the Ecole
Nationale d’Administration, de Gaulle
resembles the technical leaders of the
modern States for all that cartoonists
portray him as resembling a monarch of
the Ancien Regime. His appeal to the
masses rather than to the political
elites of France is also strikingly mod-
ern.
De Gaulle is the leader of the mass
society. He does not belong to any
group, or to any particular section of
the population. He does not stand for
any political ideology, which, in a
traditionally divided country such as
France, would alienate more support
than it would gain. De Gaulle has
explicitly stated his belief that in our
times it is technology which dominates
the universe. Hence the need for
technicians and administrators who can
answer the aspirations and the fear of
masses and who will remove the need
for the various political banners which
have dominated the battlefields of the
past. Politics in Europe is no longer
deciding how inadequate wealth should
be divided up. Politics has become the
art of ensuring that the technical
achievement of limitless prosperity will
not be prevented. Gaullism in this
sense is a-political and very modern.
The third of the major Gaullist prin-
ciples attempts to resolve the contra-
diction which is essential to all Gaullist
thought, as it is inherent in the present
constitution: namely, that France is at
one and the same time both divided
and united. Gaullism believes that essen-
tially there is no difficulty in resolving
this, since whilst Frenchmen may be
divided in terms of religion, or in terms
of recent activities (such as the resis-
tance or such as the war in Algeria)
or in terms of social distinctions, they
are united by being French. Therefore,
everything that recalls to them that
essential “Frenchness,” everything that
reminds them of their basic unity, is to
be welcomed.
QNCE again this is something which is
long-standing in French history. One
is reminded of the Sacha Guitry film
which followed the fortunes of Talley-
rand through the series of different
regimes of the Revolutionary and Napo-
leonic periods. There were a series of
crowd scenes in which a character
wrote successive slogans on the wall,
“Vive le Roi,” “Vive la Republique,”
“Vive l’Empereur,” “Vive le Roi,” and
so on, until eventually a menacing
crowd waited to see what he would
write. Rubbing out all the others, he
wrote “Vive la France” and everyone
was satisfied. Statesmen as different as
Tocqueville, Thiers, or Gambetta have
emphasised the need to find a policy
which can emphasise national unity. It
is no accident then that de Gaulle is
anxious that everyone should be able to
see, to witness, and to feel the presence
of France.
And there is no reason to believe that
he will be the last French ruler to
behave in this way. Since 1958 we have
become very conscious of two things
which are also essential to Gaullism.
The one is the economic recovery of
Europe. In the 1950 s it was only too
obvious that Europe was dependent
upon America. Is it so obvious now?
At a time when America has been feel-
ing that her overall commitment is over-
stretched, and when so much of her
effort is absorbed by Vietnam, one
should have thought not. The second is
that since 1958 one is struck by the
evolution of France. A generation is
coining forward which is not hidebound
by anti-clericalism or by memories of
the German occupation.
Economic progress is becoming
generalised and is masking the contrast
between the dynamic and the stagnant
departments. In a country which
never knew mass-circulation news-
papers, the development of television
is particularly significant. The Gaullist
belief that every Frenchman has a bond
with every other Frenchman coincides
with a moment when one Frenchman
is become more like another.
No one can deny that the General
can be exasperating, and one can
understand why a British minister
should choose to attack him personally.
No one can deny that he has made
mistakes and that, as he grows older,
he might make many more. It is possible
that the election of next spring will
show a certain shift in French politics.
But the point of this article, explor-
ing the ideas of Gaullism, is to suggest
that Gaullism does correspond to some-
thing inherent and profound within
France. At a time when a survey con-
ducted by an English review shows that
the overwhelming number of informed
English people see the Common
Market essentially as the General sees
it, and at a time when many believe
that the General’s attitude toward
Russia may soon be shared by other
European powers, it would be mis-
leading to suppose that Gaullism is a
spent force in Europe, either.
De Gaulle is the last survivor of an
old generation, the Churchill-Roosevelt-
Stalin generation. At the same time
there is much that is modern and con-
temporary about him. We have not
heard the last of General de Gaulle;
in one form or another, we have not
heard the last of Gaullism.

will discuss the successes and failures
of President de Gaulle’s policies from
Algeria to Tahiti.)


ORR
The Lone Ulsterman
by W. H. C. EDDY
MY first impression of Sydney
Sparkes Orr was gained at a
Philosophy Conference in Mel-
bourne in the late 19405. After one of
the sessions we were standing in a
circle of philosophers and Orr was
arguing against the rest. I can no
longer recall what the issue was but
he was maintaining that the theories
of the others were not satisfactory for
dealing with it and that only the Pla-
tonic theory of forms could cope with
the problems.
I remember thinking that his criti-
cisms were shrewd and telling, though
I could not accept his Platonic solu-
tion, for Orr was a philosophical idealist
while I was a realist. But what struck
me most forcibly was the personality,
of the man. He was not at all abashed
by his isolation or by the jokes to
which it gave rise but stood his ground
resolutely and ably and with warm
geniality. He obviously revelled in the
argument and the situation.
Later, from 1960 onwards, when I
was already deeply immersed in the
study of his case and had arrived at
the conclusion that he was an innocent
victim of a gross miscarriage of justice,
I came to know him intimately when
he stayed in my home for long periods.
The first thing that struck me about
him on closer acquaintance was his
courage, not merely his moral courage,
which was already obvious from the
public record, but also his physical
courage.
When he first came to stay with me
it was not long after he had been
grazed by bullets in an attempted assas-
sination. My first concern was his
physical protection and I sought and
obtained the co-operation of the N.S.W.
police. Orr acquiesced in the measures
taken but pointed out that if his
enemies were determined to kill him
we had no chance of covering all con-
tingencies. He had faced the prospect
and thought that the only attitude he
could adopt was a fatalistic one.
The second thing that struck me
about him was his method of composi-
tion. He wrote several articles and
speeches soon after he came to Sydney
and liked to write in company. He
would state a sentence and invite
comments, discussing it word by word.
When he was satisfied he would write
it down and go on to the next sen-
tence. In the early stages he was very
accessible to suggestion but as his text
became firmer he grew more and more
stubborn in his adherence to it. Occa-
sionally he would change one word
for another but he was especially re-
sistant to any suggestions for cutting.
He revised his writings many times but
each revision meant a growth, rarely
if ever a shortening. After he had
accepted most of my suggested addi-
tions reformulated in his own way,
and rejected all my suggestions for
deletions, he would read his text to
a friend over the telephone and go
through the whole process again.
He had great respect for the judg-
ment of Professor R. D. Wright and
weighed his criticisms with special care.
If Wright came down decisely for the
deletion of a passage to which I had
already objected, Orr might waver
but he argued tenaciously for the re-
tention of its substance, trying various
reformulations to meet criticisms. Once
he had made up his mind it was not
easy to change it.
I found his method of composition
inconvenient and uncongenial, especi-
ally since I was hard-pressed trying to
finish my book on his case. I would
finish my normal work usually between
9 and 11 p.m. We would then discuss
Orr’s writing for an hour or two until
he took up his discussions by telephone,
when I resumed my work on my book.
He would usually finish and go to bed
about 2 or 3 o’clock while I worked
on until 5 or 6in the morning. He
was up at about 7 and immediately
after breakfast went to the study. By
the time I was awake at 9 or 10
o’clock, he had a sheaf of comments
or criticisms on what I had written
the night before. We discussed these
before I turned to my other work. In
these discussions he was as resistant to
deletions as in his own writing. In
my case this would have been disastrous
since I like to pour everything out in
a first draft just as it comes, and I
certainly had no wish to commit my-
self to everything I had written. We
were both so hard-pressed that our dis-
cussions at times were inevitably tense.
But Orr had a rich sense of fun and
tensions would often dissolve in
laughter.
could work for long with
Orr without being impressed by his
uncompromising honesty. He left you
in no doubt about what he was think-
ing and he was careful and accurate
in his account of events. His memory,
of course, was not infallible, but it
was fantastically good. In writing up
aspects of the long struggle in which
he was engaged he was meticulous in
his attention to detail, and there are
voluminous unpublished records of all
that he could discover about what went
on. Even late last year, when he was
already seriously ill, he was working
18 hours a day giving as exact an
account as he could garner of the
moves that were then going on, and he
continued this process even in hospital
in Sydney this year, when his iends
despaired of his life.
He spent his convalescence a> our
home. His wife, Sadie, came over and
joined him here and he was happier
and more relaxed than I had ever seen
him. No account of Orr would be
complete without some reference to
his strong family feeling. He and his
wife were obviously a devoted couple,
and he made no secret of his apprecia-
tion of the staunchness of this warm
woman of sturdy commonsense. They
proudly showed us pictures of their
three children and at all times I knew
him Orr followed their doings with
devoted interest. The family bonds
were very tight.
I have often been asked whether
Orr suffered inwardly as a result of his
case and how far it contributed to his
physical breakdown. As for the first
question, of course he suffered. The
externals, such as his enforced poverty,
did not seem to bother him seriously,
though he was often worried about
provision for his family, and this was
one of his reasons for accepting the
settlement. He did not wish to leave
his family saddled with debts and with
no provision for their future. Apart
from that, Orr suffered real anguish.
Sometimes late at night the pain
would burst out of him in a long
statement about the injustice of it all
and the blindness of so many who did
not see what it implied for them. How
far this affected his health it is
impossible for me to say. Despite a
congenital heart defect, he seemed to
be in vigorous health until two or three
years ago. He himself told me recently
that the struggle had not affected hfc
health while the issues were clear cut
and he was sure he was doing what
was right. When many of his sup-
porters began to press upon him com-
promise solutions and he wavered,
partly for political reasons (he needed
their support), partly because he had
strong feelings of gratitude and affec-
tion toward them from the past, he
became uncertain what was the right

One heater isn’t whole house heating.
But Gilbarco Ducted Heating is!
Ask an expert and he’ll tell you a heater in one location, no matter how good and how
expensive, won’t warm a whole house. Warm air must be distributed through ducts,
individually into each room, for even house heating.
This is just what Gilbarco Central Heating does. And at a reasonable cost. It’s oil-fired
and thermostatically controlled for economy and gives you warmed filtered air distributed
through outlets into every room of your house. In summer it converts to assist ventilation
throughout the house.
If you’ve decided on whole-house heating, get it. Go to Gilbarco!

thing to do. From that time, he said,
his health rapidly deteriorated.
Certainly when he tried, near the
end, to write accounts of the role of
some to whom he had been very close
but whom he regarded as having be-
trayed the cause, he could not write
for more than half an hour without
bringing on heart pains. He tried vari-
ous means to overcome this difficulty,
such as dictating to his wife or talking
out the facts, but it was not the physical
effort; it was the thoughts and the
emotions that were too painful. He
had to complete these writings in
small fragments. Apart from that, I
saw no evidence that the long struggle
broke his spirit. It possibly broke his
body, but the last time he was here a
few months ago his spirit was as
serene and keen as ever it was.
Nobody can understand the motiva-
tions of Orr’s long struggle who ignores
his Irish background. He was an
Ulsterman but he also sympathised with
the revolutionary traditions of the
South. He saw himself as carrying on
Irish traditions of struggle against in-
justice. I always thought that there was
a romantic element in all this but as
an ingredient it was something much
more serious. Orr was acutely aware of
the importance for the flourishing of
democratic institutions of integrity in
those who administer them and he was
shocked by the indifference of so many
to evidence of its absence. He saw his
struggle not merely as a matter of
justice for himself but also as a struggle
for the purification of institutions in
Tasmania and beyond.
■A s such, he was sure of its historical
importance and found it hard to
sympathise with those who could be de-
flected from the main issues by sensa-
tional personal allegations, especially
when the evidence behind them was so
obviously trumped up and false. He re-
jected the views of those who held that
the prestige of institutions must be de-
fended by pretending that they had
done no wrong when, in fact, they
had. The end of that course, he saw
clearly, was rapid deterioration and an
eventual crash of prestige. The alterna-
tive path is exposure of the wrongs done
and reform. Only in this way can a
deserved prestige be maintained. No-
body was more solicitous of the pres-
tige of universities or of the courts.
But he was also aware of the dangers
of a fake prestige and struggled against
it. As long as there are democratic insti-
tutions in Australia, Sydney Sparks Orr
will have an honorable place in our
history. As the men in power who have
done wrong in his case pass from the
scene and no longer have to be pro-
tected, the significance of his struggle
will emerge with increasing clarity.
Orr was volatile. In a single day he
would pass through many moods and
express a great variety of opinions but
his long struggle attests above all that
underlying constancy and seriousness of
purpose which is the mark of great-
ness. Who else could have done what
Orr has done?

Prophets Without Honor
The Journalists of Saigon
By GEOFFREY FAIRBAIRN
IN the 1930 s almost all the good
journalists enjoyed a consensus of
informed opinion about the aims of
the Nazis. But they were not believed,
since it could never be proved, in a
definite sense, even after the occupation
of the Rhineland, that the Anschluss,
the occupation of the Sudetenland, the
seizure of Danzig, and so on and were
to be the consequences of infirmity of
anti-Fascist purpose; and since most
people’s humanly understandable crav-
ing for peace and security seemed to
be best served by negotiations like
Munich. The will to resist on the
part of the small States of Central
and Eastern Europe was slowly eroded
and their inclination to accommodate
themselves to an apparently irresistible
power was sanctified by the clear un-
willingness, or inability, of the great
anti-Fascist Powers to act in defence
of any small State when the chips were
down.
And so it might be today if young
Americans and Australians were not
dying in Vietnam (the anti-Communist
Vienamese are still dying in battle in
greater numbers, it should be noted,
but Western allied casualties are now
heavy). What kind of war are they
dying in? Just as in the 19305, there
is a consensus of opinion amongst Wes-
tern journalists about this, however
much these journalists may differ about
what should be the Western response.
And the vast majority of them—how-
ever hedged about their commitments
may be, however disillusioned they may
have been by past events —opt for con-
tinued resistance.
Robert Shaplen is one of the most
experienced Western journalistic ob-
servers of Vietnam who writes in Eng-
lish; the best prose writer amongst
them; the steadiest in point of under-
standing the general moving picture;
and because he is the most personally
reticent in his narrative, he is the most
moving of all toward the end of his
latest book —“The Lost Revolution:
Vietnam 1945-65.” Andre Deutsch,
$4.50 —when he attempts to make sug-
gestions about what might be done. He
is the best journalist in the English-
speaking world to write about Vietnam.
Never have the exacting standards of
the “New Yorker” been better justified.
Shaplen, like Denis Warner, Malcolm
Browne, Michael Field, David Halber-
stam, and indeed like Gerald Stone, a
“protestor,” has no real doubts at all
about the nature of the struggle: “Over-
all military strategy is undoubtedly
formulated in Hanoi and radioed or
sent by cadre couriers down to these
regions or zones.”
Denis Warner’s similar analysis is too
well known to require recapitulation in
these pages. Malcolm Browne also
argues quite as strongly in “The New
Face of War”: “The Viet Cong expects
to win its war in South Vietnam. But it
is also offering the techniques it devel-
oped here to all other Communist revo-
lutionary groups in underdeveloped
nations throughout the world, especi-
ally in Africa and Latin America. A
growing number of these nations are
showing interest in the Vietnamese
patent and, before long, many of them
may be paying royalties to Hanoi,
Peking, and Moscow . . . Accordingly,
South Vietnam is a laboratory.”
Michael Field writes much more dis-
tufbedly in “The Prevailing Wind:
Witness in Vietnam”: “The people I
saw in North Vietnam are like their
Chinese allies, emaciated through in-
adequate nutrition. They automatically
fulfil the dictates of their fanatical
leaders . . . They aim to destroy all
that the West presumes to stand for.
To spread the poison with which they
have been inoculated, they will kill,
torture, and deceive . . . They will
accept untold privations. They have
learnt to hate their adversaries abso-
lutely. There can, at present, be no
reasonable discourse with them, for
they are the homunculi of the phan-
tasmagorical world issued from the
‘scientific socialism’ of Marx.”
The Quagmire
J)AVID HALBERSTAM, for long re-
garded by some anti-Communists
as a “bad boy” and praised by Gra-
ham Greene for having “not (taken)
at all the conventional line about the
American presence in Vietnam,”
writes in “The Making of a Quag-
mire”: “The new Indo-China war was
not a spontaneous uprising from the
South. It was part of a calculated and
systematic conspiracy on the part of the
government in Hanoi to take over the
South. But it was the most subtle kind
of conspiracy, for though Hanoi dir-
ected the war, set its pace, controlled
its overall strategy, and on the inter-
national front articulated the propa-
ganda aims of the Viet Cong, it did
not in those days (1959) send North
Vietnamese troops to fight in the
South . .
Gerald Stone, who alone of these
journalists opposes the American com-
mitment in Vietnam and who speaks
of “southern Communists demanding”
help from the North with their “in-
cipient rebellion” an estimate that
ignores the command structure of the
Indo-Chinese Communist politico-
military machine which defeated the
French and shows a strange unaware-
ness of who can demand what in a
centrally controlled Communist organ-
isation—nevertheless, being an honest
reporter, writes in his “War Without

Honor” that by early 1965 “it (in-
filtration) was indisputably taking place
on an ever-increasing scale with grow-
ing numbers of northerners included.
At the same time, North Vietnam,
aided by China, was pumping large
quantities of arms, munitions, and other
military supplies southward. This was
open aggression—a calculated, illegal
invasion of territory aimed at top-
pling an opposing government that had
shown itself capable of suppressing in-
ternal opposition. No quibbling over
numbers of infiltrators and tonnage of
arms could obscure the fact.”
Now it may be that all these ex-
perienced reporters are wrong and that
Dr. J. F. Cairns, who has never availed
himself of the opportunities offered
freely (in both ordinary senses of that
term) to visit any part of South East
Asia as a parliamentarian, is right.
It can not be definitively proved, any
more than the findings of great jour-
nalists like Douglas Reed and so on
could be definitively proved right against
the assertions of the appeasers and of
people like Oswald Mosley in 1936-
39. The fact that such people had to be
discredited or even locked up later on
should not be adduced to support the
analogy: the fact that they were quite
hideously wrong, and the journalists on
the spot quite terrifyingly right, must
be.
The Lost Revolution
JJOWEVER, to return to Robert
Shaplen’s book, it not only confers
a wise and experienced authority upon
the findings of young journalists on the
spot in Vietnam, and confirms the
findings of deeply experienced journ-
alists on the spot; it also throws a good
deal of new light upon Diem, parti-
cularly upon the reasons for his dis-
trust of most Western advisers at mo-
ments of crisis (dating back to 1954),
more light upon the motives and be-
haviour of that strange, almost eerie
man, Nhu, and upon other Vietnamese
nationalists of varying significance; and
a deadly steady light upon the funda-
mental cruelty and mendacity of the
French colonial overlords—and upon
“The Lost Revolution,” the relative
failure of American political endeavor
after World War II in this part of
“Asia.”
He is wonderful in his descriptive
analysis of this failure —almost as won-
derful as he is in his sketch of the
Vietnamese Resistant in 1945, the man
appallingly injured by French colonial-
ism, who he does not believe would
be serving the Communists today—
wonderful in his evocation of the kind
of Western bureaucratic mean-minded-
ness that for years kept General
Lansdale (the fabulous “Hillindale”
of “The Ugly American”) away from
South Vietnam (the same bureaucratic
mean-mindedness dogs the footsteps of
our own Colonel E. F. Serong today);
wonderful in his understanding of the
two major weaknesses of the Western-
backed Diem’s regime’s responses to
Communist aggression the decision
after 1954 to form a regular, orthodox
army (a point which has again and
again been made by Denis Warner),
and the inability to train civil servants
not to look upon service in the country-
side as constituting only a disagreeable
exile, the disagreeability of which must
be taken out on “the locals”; and won-
derful, above all, in his steady vision
of the fact that chance plays a great
part in human political affairs and yet
that, despite this, the Americans—rep-
resenting the West alone until re-
cently—have lost their sense of revo-
lutionary message.
And of course this is the irony of
our time: quite clearly, the future
in any reasonable estimation lies with
the West; its cast of mind is best
equipped to deal with the truly great
revolution of our time—the technologi-
cal revolution—and so are its flexible
institutions and patterns of behaviour;
Marx-Leninism is not an irrelevant bore
only in the West, but in the Soviet
Union also. Yet—and it might be a
terrible yet —Peking in its pre-techno-
logicality is using the intellectually out-
worn concepts of “pure Leninism” in
order to assert that “The wind from
the east prevails over the wind from
the west.” This is a terrible fantasy,
however historically explicable; this is
what young Westerners are dying in
order to prove false. If one reads
Shaplen (or Warner et al.) and then
reads Truong Chinh and Mao (et
al.) — then one learns, or re-learns,
“what it is all about”: a dreadful con-
test between free men, often muddled
and self-critical, and the devotees of a
philosophy that sees history not as a
struggle for values but as an ineluctable
process.

TAKEN FROM the “New Statesman”:
"Evelyn Waugh’s ex-cook, now Univer-
sity lecturer, needs 2/3 large unfur-
nished rooms/flat near Holland Park or
Mayfield comprehensive schools with
nearby or built-in kindly lady to pre-
vent my 10-year-old becoming a latch-
key daughter. Reasonable rent, evening

What's cooking?
MEN MIGHT make the best chefs,
but as diners it is women who are push-
ing the Australian gastronomical revo-
lution that is wiping out our old steak-
’n’-eggs mealtime image. This is the
view of Miss Marjorie Moore, executive
director of the Fifth National Accom-
modation and Catering Exhibition and
Seminar in Melbourne last week. To
it went 440 hoteliers, moteliers,
restaurateurs, and professional caterers
from all States, New Zealand, and New
Guinea to learn and tell each other
what was cooking, now, in the business.
“When they go out dining, Dad sticks
to his oysters, steak, and pudding, but
it’s Mum who wants to try something
different, and often steers Dad on to
it, too,” Miss Moore said
To suit the Australian dining palate,
a few curbs have been necessary on
the Continental newcomers, she went
on. Waiters particularly had to watch
not to be too subservient. It em-
barrassed Australians, who didn’t want
as much bowing and scraping as Euro-
peans and Americans. And we’re still
behind in our French lessons. A lot of
local maitres d’hotel had found they
could lose custom by printing menus in
French. If they wanted to persist with
the habit, they were being advised to
put the English equivalent somewhere
nearby, too.
The exhibition that went with the
seminar had a few terrifying novel
gadgets to keep customers’ hearts and
food warm. On show were the newest
radar ranges and microwave ovens,
capable of instant conversion from deep
freeze to edible temperature. We can
imagine a lot of mums who’d like to
experiment with that sort of thing, too.
Go To The Ant
THE TAKEOVER by the anony-
mous giants of more and more smaller
companies means the disappearance of
the family business built up by men
in a more picturesque age when pri-
vate enterprise had perhaps more
emphasis on enterprise. One of these
was Thomas Cowan and Co., of New-
castle, now swallowed up in Houghton
and Byrne Holdings Ltd., and giving
that company the business of fumigat-
ing shipping and grain cargoes in every
major Australian port.
Thomas Cowan began in Gosford,
N.S.W., without even an office, then
spread to Newcastle. During a holiday
trip to Hong Kong he met an engineer
from the Panama Canal who told him
that America was spending millions of
dollars to counter the devastating
effects of termites in the Panama Canal
zone.
Cowan gamely set up a branch office
in New York and got the contract to
clean white ants out of the canal. This
was the turning point in his career.
Before he died in 1958 at the age of
86 he had spread the company opera-
tions through offices at Hong Kong,
Bangkok, and Singapore. The name of
Thomas Cowan is still on the doors
there, although other companies have
bought the businesses.
Thomas Cowan, a man of little
formal education, was a practical
fellow who cultivated colonies of white
ants so that he could study the means
to destroy them. His observation of
the ants under glass and microscope
revealed a highly developed communal
system with its life centring around its
well-protected queen. But the most
rewarding of Cowan’s observations
came from the study of hygiene in the
process of which the ants cleaned each
other’s coats. This was the knowledge
he used in his eradication process.
There was no secret about Cowan’s
method. The only formula that he
guarded was the make-up of the deadly
powder which he injected into the
trails of the wood-destroying ants. The
powder vaporised, spread along the
trails, and impregnated the microscopic
fur on the skin of the ants. As the
ants cleaned each other they absorbed
the fatal dose. Once the queen was
dead the colony could no longer survive.
Cowan did not need to see his victims
to kill them. He needed to find only
a tell-tale trail. The one essential was
that the ants be not disturbed because
the wary destroyers might not return
over a broken trail.
Cowan knew that white ants were
capable of travelling incredible dis-
tances. He knew that a colony could
extend its activity to the other side
of the street and he knew that the
cleaning out of white ants on one pro-
perty often cleared up the problems
of neighbors. He knew, too, that the
ants feasted not only on wood but on
books and other paper. He could pro-
duce exhibits to show that where the
ant trails crossed steel they etched a
track through the metal.
When Houghton and Byrne took
over on July 1 there were only three
shareholders in the family - owned
private company including Thomas’
only surviving son, George, and his
grandson, Robert. They got 65,000
fully paid 50-cent shares currently
worth $78,000 and an unstated cash
settlement.

Rosy Glow
WE CALLED on Edmond Samuels,
chemist, poet, composer, philosopher,
and manager of popular entertainers, at
his Potts Point, Sydney, flat. The walls
of the flat were covered with glossy
prints of stars of show business, all of
them signed, and the living-room is
perpetually bathed in a rosy glow,
achieved, Mr. Samuels told us, by skil-
ful use of curtains. However, Mr.
Samuels himself is far from seeing
everything perpetually bathed in a rosy
glow. He is preoccupied with world
peace.
As his contribution to this subject,
Mr. Samuels recently released a record-
ing through Columbia, which will be
sent to the Queen, President Johnson,
the Pope, the Governor-General, and
church leaders in Australia and over-
seas. The 45-rpm disc carries a record-
ing of Mr. Samuels’ poem “The Un-
known Soldier Speaks from Menin
Gate,” read by John Clements. The
cover-design is an early painting by
Frank Hodgkinson, based on an idea
of Mr. Samuels.
“I wrote ‘Menin Gate’ in 1937, but
the message of peace is just as applic-
able today,” Mr. Samuels told us. “I
was inspired by the Menin Gate
memorial in Ypres, France, dedicated


to 56,000 British soldiers whose bodies
were never found. I had been contribut-
ing poetry during the ’thirties to the
2UE Diggers’ Session with Harry Yates.
I was given 24 hours’ notice to write a
poem for the annual Armistice Day
Festival of Remembrance. A lot of
people still have a copy of the poem
framed.”
The poem was written in Mr.
Samuels’ Headache Bar, the world’s
first, against a background of 7000
autographs from celebrities, and in be-
tween listening and giving advice to a
handful of other celebrities and every-
day customers who included the Head-
ache Bar in their daily round.
Young Edmond Samuels, a mixture
of Scottish and Jewish descent, returned
to Australia from Scotland while in his
teens. At the age of 18, in a year he’d
prefer not to specify, he was apprenticed
to a chemist in Castlereagh Street, Syd-
ney, opposite the Australia Hotel. By
the ’thirties he owned the pharmacy
and with a showman’s touch not com-
mon in his profession he opened the
Headache Bar.
The idea, and, no doubt, the 300
well-known people who attended the
opening, captured hundreds of feet on
newsreels in Australia and claimed
space in several overseas newspapers.
Since the ’thirties Mr. Samuels has
written three musicals. His “Song of
the Snowy” and “All About Love” have
so far been shelved. But the boisterous
lyrics and music of “The Highwayman”
were well received by Sydney and Mel-
bourne audiences during 1950. Colum-
bia has since cut an LP of highlights of
the musical.
His third recording is philosophical.
Cut on a sunny afternoon at Columbia’s
studio near the Quay, Mr. Samuels’
record covers subjects such as Advice
to youth, Peace of mind, Beware of
tattlers, Do unto others, Borrowed time,
Love thy neighbor, Humility, and Posi-
tive thinking. “Thousands of people
have listened to my record here with
the curtains pulled across the windows
and they have all gone away thankful,”

When young, I came from Riga,
To do well here, was eager;
But Wife and strife
Have wrecked my life,
And now my gains are meagre.
Sure, I am an Irishman,
From Mallow, County Cork;
I like Australia, though I find
It’s rare to hear good talk.
’Tis better since late closing,
So much more civilised,
And the local tipple’s stronger
Than I had realised.
I am a Swede.
I came here out of greed.
For sunlight. This does indeed exceed
My expectations. I am freed
From Northern darkness and depressive
need.
This is the life that I do wish to lead.

AROUND MELBOURNE
Swinging Little Englanders
IT’S interesting how different
Governments go about spread-
ing goodwill. Last week we had
Mr. Charlton Heston spreading
sweetness and Mark Twain on be-
half of the U.S. State Department.
This week we had Keith Ovenden
and Jeremy Burford giving us
swinging England on behalf of the
Commonwealth Relations Office.
Actually they are on a universi-
ties debating tour and already they
have been to Perth, ANU, Mel-
bourne, Monash, and now on to
Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, New-
castle, and Armidale. The idea is
for the brilliant young to meet the
young. The U.K. Government pays
their fares, our universities feed
them and put pillows under their
heads. A gentleman from the High
Commission said: “They can say
what they like. We’d rather, of
course, that they didn’t slate the Old
Country too much, but nor do they
have to agree with the Government.”
The two were cleverly chosen.
Keith Ovenden is 6ft. 4|in., Beatle-
haired, and, until he talks, rather like
the ruckman recruit from Mananga-
tang. He’s a double honors in
Institutions and English Literature
from Keele University in Stafford-
shire and a former president of the
Keele debates union. He makes a
lovely contrast to Jeremy Burford,
6ft. s|in., who is smooth, utterly
Cambridge. He is an honors law
man and a former president of the
Cambridge Union. He is going on
to a Fulbright at Oxford. Ovenden
is going on to a Fulbright to Michi-
gan to read politics.
JN Perth the debate was “The
Westminster System is the worst
form of Government apart from all
the others.” At Monash it was
“Columbus went too far,” and at
Melbourne “That Culturally this
House regrets having been born in
the 20th Century.”
Your correspondent, who still re-
tains an affection for this century,
went to hear this last debate. In
the affirmative corner we had Keith
Ovenden, Miss Morag Fraser, an ex-
editor of Farrago, and Richard
Walsh, president of Sydney SRC
and editor of Oz. In the negative
corner we had Jeremy Burford,
Gareth Evans, president of Mel-
bourne SRC, and Patrick McCaug-
hey, an M.A. student and “Age” Art
critic.
It would be a mistake to bore you
here with all the argument. Some
of it was very intense as if the
speakers felt that all could be saved
right there in the Melbourne Uni-
versity Buffet.
A questioner from the floor asked
Mr. Walsh: “Are your attempts at
wit a further demonstration of life
in the 20th century?”
“Yes,” said he sadly, “I am ex-
hibit A.”
But it was the visitors who fre-
quently kept things moving. Miss
Fraser quoted from various volumes
at great length until a student ten
rows back stood up and said: “From
where I am, I can’t hear a word you
are saying.” Jeremy Burford said:
“I CAN hear and I’m willing to
swop places.”
As I say, the visitors were skilled
at abuse. Keith Ovenden pulled him-
self up to his 6ft. 4|in. and started
with: “I’m the short one.” Then he
said: “It is my duty to warn you
against Mr. Burford. He is a liar
from Cambridge. He has devoted
most of his study to criminology
and when he comes before you re-
member that anything he says is the
product of an unscrupulous legal
mind. The last time he was in a
cinema was when he was four. That
was when he saw Bambi and he
went out bawling after three
minutes.” Cambridge, he said, was
known for its lovely dreaming spires.
Not so, anymore. It was renowned
for its screaming tyres. Then he
proceeded to demolish the 20th
century. “Mr. Burford is a product
of this. I come from London, ‘the
swinging city.’ This is a term coined
by Time and Life magazines. They
inform the world that London is the
most exciting place on earth. And
they do this just before the Ameri-
cans move in with their own mass
culture, the Bunny Club, Batman,
and Pop Art. All this cohesed just
a little too easily. They persuade the
tourist to visit the swinging city so
that they absorb this muck.
“Let me tell you about ‘Batman.’
Oh, it’s a clever money-making
idea, produced at such an infan-
tile level the smallest moron can
understand it. Yet at the same time
it is so bad the average adult can
laugh at it. Pop is rubbish.”
Mr. Ovenden then proceeded to
cover the ugly breakdown in modern
culture. He described the Beatles as
just an example of brilliant selling
on the consumer market. They were
a trick, couldn’t play, couldn’t sing,
yet the whole world had been per-
suaded to swallow them. Then, for a
man who had gained his culture at
a Staffordshire university, he said
some quite frightful things about
“Coronation Street.” Only “Z Cars”
was spared, and I’m glad he didn’t
disillusion me about that.
Next we had the tall one, Jeremy
Burford, 6ft. sJin. “I will tell you
something about Keith Ovenden,”
he said. “He’s a typical example of
the new British .meritocracy, a self-
made man, and he has respect only
for his creator. He’s a good debater,
but there are two things I don’t like
about him . . . his face.
H E has written off Cambridge,
but, you know, the old place has
discovered some pretty permanent
things. I think it was in 1934 that
they discovered that grasshoppers
could hear with their legs. It was
successfully proved by the scientists.
When they tapped a tuning fork the
grasshoppers reacted by jumping
vigorously. Next they removed the
legs from the grasshoppers, tapped
the tuning fork, and they didn’t up
at all. The case was proved.”
Mr. Burford didn’t say a word to
restore our faith in Ena Sharpies,
but he did point out that the mass
media, while not being culture, had
been enormously successful in the
spreading of it. Culture was closer
to the hand of the common man
than ever before in history. In the
past only a very small elite, only
the very rich, had been concerned
with it. The majority of man was
merely concerned with his own sur-
vival. There was an attempt from a
tweedy sports coat in the second row
on behalf of folk singing and folk
stories, and Mr. Burford did concede
this was indeed all very charming.
However, to a cultured man it
wasn’t greatly to be regretted.
Patrick McCaughey restored our
faih in the 20th. He told us of the
great creative forces in all the arts,
of Picasso, James Joyce, Henry
Moore . . . Admittedly, the warden,
Mr. Sinclair Wilson, did interrupt
with: “There’s one creative force
which seems to be disappearing with
the pill,” and the young Mr. Mc-
Caughey replied: “Oh, I admit,
there’s a lot of new media about.”
It was an efficient, well-conducted
debate. The motion was lost 200 to
71 with 27 abstentions, and so we
went home somewhat comforted that
our century was not lost after all.

ON THE MARGIN
The Sandman Cometh
SOME time ago
Lord Casey,
while he was in
Britain, set about a
singularly difficult,
indeed desperate,
undertaking. It was
to try to get people
interested in the
British Common-
wealth. When he
came back to Aus-
tralia he admitted,
with the frankness which is one of his
most attractive traits, that he had hot
had much success. He said that when he
mentioned the British Commonwealth
to important persons in London “their
eyes would glaze.”
This response, though discouraging,
caused no surprise to those who had
made any study of eye-glazing and its
causes. The British Commonwealth is
well-known to rank high on the list of
subjects that produce this reaction. My
own memory goes back to the days
when it was called the British Empire.
I am bound to say that in its later years
the British Empire was pretty eye-
glazing, too, if not quite as sedatively
so as the British Commonwealth.
This is a common characteristic of
motley collections of countries. At a
party, try to make your fellow-guests’
eyes shine (or pop) by launching into
a eulogy of the United Nations, or
NATO, or SEATO. You will meet with
much the same disheartening result as
Lord Casey did.
Let me emphasise, before going fur-
ther, that a tendency to glaze the eyes
does not connote any moral unworthi-
ness—rather the contrary. The late
Albert Schweitzer, for example, was a
fairly consistent eye-glazer; whereas
Christine Keeler, in her heyday, was not.
It is a general, if deplorable, truth that
the lilies and languors of virtue fail to
make our eyes light up as brightly as
the raptures and roses of vice.
At the same time one must recognise
that Miss Keeler no longer rivets the
attention as she did three years ago.
She shows signs of developing a certain
modest status as an eye-glazer. This
illustrates the familiar fact that too
much publicity can rob any famous
character even far more interesting
ones that Miss Keeler—of their fascina-
tion. It happened to Bernard Shaw
(though he is making a comeback) and
more recently to Sir Winston Churchill.
Things can be over-exposed as well
as people. In this country the map of
Australia is a conspicuous example.
Waggish persons sometimes try to give
it a fresh appeal by standing it on its
side and pretending it looks like a
head, with Cape York for the nose. The
expedient is pitifully unsuccessful —our
map, sad to say, is eye-glazing from any
angle.
On a wider scale the present era has
produced several topics of high glazing
potency, the supreme one being, of
course, space. The very emptiness of
space makes it intensely uninteresting.
It is rendered yet more so by the robot-
like character of the military men who-
travel in it, their banal conversation—
consisting largely of “All Systems go”—
and their identically presentable fami-
lies.
The Teenage Revolution has risen ta
about 74 points on the UNESCO eye-
glazing scale (in which UNESCO is-
-100). This is not because the subject is
intrinsically dull but because, like
Churchill and the Sydney Opera House,
it has been talked about too much. It
has a strange power of self-perpetuation,
by breaking into sub-topics like the
Beatles, the surf cult, and mini-skirts,
each of which after a brief novelty slides,
into the soporific.
Turning to the literary field, one is-
struck by the mastery of eye-glazing
prose displayed by the writers of blurbs
on book jackets. There was a good recent
specimen: “This outspoken novel
describes the search for identity of a
young bricklayer.” Another: “The hercr
is a dedicated young Naval officer
haunted by a sense of personal failure.”
One could compile an extensive list
of eye-glazing words and phrases, such
as heritage, heartwarming, alienation.
Apart from the great mass-glazers
like Space and SEATO, most of us
have our personal nominations. One of
mine is the private life of Sophia
Loren, whose efforts to become legally
married to Signor Ponti have been re-
ported for so many years. It is hard to
remain shining-eyed over an actress of
moderate talent, who is also implacably
monogamous. Elizabeth Taylor, by con-
trast, has never completely glazed my
eyes through all her marital vicissitudes.
Though it must be conceded that her
attachment to Mr. Burton shows dis-
turbing signs of permanence. I would
hate Liz to finish up as respectable and
eye-glazing as the British Common-
wealth.

Open bag. Put in product. Close bag.
Packaging products is far simpler
when your package is a polyethylene film bag.
Packaging has two basic costs: the
cost of the package; the cost of put-
ting the product into its package. On
both counts, polyethylene film bags
can lower costs. First, because poly-
ethylene film is one of the lowest cost
packaging materials. Second, because
polyethylene film bags are so simple
to fill and seal.
Only a small amount of machinery is
required for the switch to packaging
in polyethylene film bags. And once
the switch is made, it’s not unusual
for a manufacturer to double the
number of products packaged each
hour.
The bags themselves come in any
shape or size and may be printed in
up to five colours. They are simple
to close with a heat-sealer, tape or
twist-tie.
Union Carbide will be happy to intro-
duce you to a bag supplier who can
demonstrate the simplicity and econ-
omy of polyethylene bag packaging.
When ordering direct from your bag
supplier, be sure to see samples and

resins listed at right.

A SHORT STORY
DID you ever eat a dead-mouse
sandwich? Statz did. It was pre-
pared for him by a bunch of wags
at th% Criterion one Saturday night. He
ate it with apparent relish, or so the
story goes.
A foreigner, an eccentric, a noncon-
formist, an alcoholic, settled who knows
how or why, in a tightly knit, dull,
gossip-loving community, there were
bound to be stories, some true, others
apocryphal. Statz was a natural butt:
everyone poked fun at him, laughed at
him, and probably pitied him. Charac-
ters did imitations of him at parties.
Plenty of times I had laughed, too, with
an inward feeling of shame. There was
the story about his groping all night
around and around the big gum in the
City Gardens searching for a way out
of what seemed to him to be an exitless
cul-de-sac but that one’s been told
before about other drunks.
My experience with Statz has its
amusing side, too, but it cured me of
laughing at him. And because of the
timing of the incident I owe him a
debt of gratitude.
I was in Nettle’s pub in Sidgwick
Street, morosely drinking by myself as
I had almost every night and a good
part of the days for more than two
months. I don’t know if I have the seed
or whatever it is of the alcoholic in me
until my wife left me I had been a
normal, average drinker—but I had cer-
tainly reached a dangerous stage, need-
ing it more every day and actually en-
joying the thought, in some twisted way,
that I was destroying myself and that
people (including, of course, Heather)
would know \yhy. I don’t even know if
I loved Heather after eight years of not
particularly happy marriage. Before the
first six months were over I realised
she was rotten with self-interest and we
were always having rows, after which
we would go about the flat for days
trying to avoid each other mentally as
well as physically. In spite of this, she
continued to be irresistible to me. So
perhaps that’s love.
I just couldn’t stand the thought of
her physically belonging to anyone else.
The image of their love-making kept
recurring, making my bowels squirm,
my head spin with jealous loathing.
There were other times when I con-
gratulated myself on being free of her
and thankful that there were no child-
ren to complicate the situation, but that
physical thing had to be blotted out,
especially if I were to sleep.
It was a quiet night at Nettle’s
only a dozen or so other drinkers in
the bar — 1 and I was still reasonably
sober. I was getting increasingly fed up
with a loud-mouthed trio next to me
who were discussing Saturday’s race
chances and was thinking of moving
when the swing doors burst open and
STATZ
Statz made his customary whirlwind
entry, staggered to a standstill, and
swayed back on his heels at the bar.
Dressed in a leather overcoat, neat blue
suit, a pork-pie hat, and carrying, as
usual, a gaping Gladstone bag, he stood
undulating, hands grasping the counter
edge, surveying the room from half-
closed eyes, head thrown back, hair-
fringed lips pouted as if frozen in the
middle of a kiss.
“Glass of wine, pliz,” he commanded
as Eddie paused before him.
“Don’t you think you’ve had enough,
old boy?” said Eddie. This was
standard procedure and was the reason
Statz was seen in so many bars each
night.
£JTATZ seemed to swell up like a
touched-up toad. He eyed the bar-
man with withering dignity. “I will
be the judge of this, my man,” he said
carefully.
Eddie shrugged and poured him a
glass of port, which Statz drained at a
gulp. Then he grabbed his bag and
staggered to a bench against the wall,
where he sat, unmoving, as if waiting
for the stuff to work. Occasionally his
face twitched.
For a while I forgot about Statz, be-
came immersed in my own troubles.
Why, I asked myself, did it have to be
a bludger like Anderson who had . . .
well, cuckolded me? Anderson was a
worthless but muscular street photog-
rapher, of all things. It was an extra
blow to the pride. I tortured myself
for the umpteenth time with the thought
of the contemptuously open way they
would kiss and paw each other in my
presence. You may well ask why I did
nothing about it. But, in a situation
like that, with the odds stacked against
you, there is literally nothing you can
do, short of murder, which would not
By TOM PICKERING
make you appear even more ridiculous.
I doubt if there is anything quite as
hurtful as someone you love teaming
with another and turning against you.
When I looked again, the little man
was still in the same spot but he had
another glass of wine in his trembling
hand. The glass was tilted and the
liquor was spilling. Finally, he placed
the glass on the floor and began to roll
a cigarette. His fumbling fingers
sprayed tobacco all around as each
attempt ended in failure.
Mainly because my punting neighbors
were knocking themselves out watching
him, I went over to Statz and offered
him my packet. “Have one of these,”
I said.
He inclined his head like a cockatoo
as he attempted to focus. “My name,”
he said, with drunken formality, “is
Stephen Statz. I thank you.” He took
a cigarette.
“That’s all right,” I said, sitting down
next to him and striking a match.
“You’re welcome. How are you to-
night?”
Statz swung around and inspected
me more closely, probably to make
sure he was not being ridiculed. “Your
name was?” he asked.
I told him and he repeated the name
to himself several times. ‘T am so
happy,” he said at length, holding out
a limp hand.
He shook my hand for so long I be-
gan to feel embarrassed. It was lik6
holding a dead, featherless bird. His
faded eyes, which peered at me from
a face covered with red splotches and
fine broken veins, also had a dead-bird
look about them. I withdrew my hand
as gently as possible.
Uncomfortable under his scrutiny, I
was at a loss for words and was about
to return to the bar when I noticed the
rolled paper protruding from his bag
and remembered hearing that he was
an artist.
“I believe you paint, Mr. Statz,” I
said.
“Paint!” Statz roared scornfully. And
then, almost inaudibly: “Paint. Yes, I
paint. Nobody know what I do. Where
do you hear this? I am dirty drunk-
ard. Don’t you know that? Is this not
the opinion of the townspeople? But
there are times I get away from all
these pigs.” He wrinkled his face in
disgust and, for a moment, I thought
he was going to burst into tears. Then
he smiled. “Out with the trees, ah, the
green, friendly trees and the quiet ani-
mals who do not mock. Sky above,
earth below, breezes on my face stirring.
I am poet, too, no? Alone with hature,
there I paint. They would not believe
that, but you will believe. What I
see I paint: the beautiful trees, the
sky, the clouds with the sun upon them,
the shy little birds with the frightened
eyes. But not of me are they afraid.

For me they are my models. Believe
that. And no damn bloody nasty people.
I am drunk now, but believe what I
say.”
All this was delivered with much
working of face muscles, waving of
hands. Unknowingly, I had opened the
floodgates. Because of his condition, it
was difficult to judge whether this back-
to-nature stuff was spurious or genuine.
He was attracting so much attention
that I wanted to get away.
A sudden grunt. “Look,” he said. “I
show you. What no man has seen, you
I show.”
He made a dive for the open Glad-
stone bag on the floor and took out the
roll of paper. He unrolled it across his
knees. It was a watercolor, a rural
scene in violent colors: a red and yellow
cow which, owing to faulty perspective,
appeared to squat on the branch of a
tree, goggling with swollen eyes. Odd-
shaped birds hovered in a molten,
swirling sky. I know nothing about art,
but it looked to me like the work of a
child or a madman which, I suppose,
was not surprising.
“This and this . . . and this!” he
spluttered, stabbing at the picture with
his finger. “I am inspire when I paint
this animal. I love this animal who
comes quite up close to me and looks
at me and makes no sound and DOES
NOT LAUGH! This animal stop eat-
ing grass and sat for his portrait. So?
A cow. Sweet, gentle cow. Ach! No-
body know the way Statz feel. But you
will understand, my friend. The rest
do not matter.
He glared angrily about the bar.
“Bastards!” he spat. “Bastards. All of
them. I come to this country and, by
God, am treat like bloody damn dog.
I, Statz, the tailor!” He smote his nar-
row chest. “Do they want my beautiful
work? No, I am foreigner, dirty Jew.
A Jew is different maybe? A Jew does
not need food, clothing, a home? He is
to be denied happiness? So I drink and
I swear at them and they laugh. Al-
ways they laugh. But I am six of them.
They are nothing! Can they make a
fine suit of clothes, a fine, pretty dress?
Could they create a perfect animal
like this? Statz is great artist and they
are beneath my feet. They are pigs!”
I nodded politely from time to time
during this outburst and, when it
seemed he had run down, I had our
glasses recharged. I felt it was the least
I could do. Statz took the glass without
thanking me and drank it quickly.
H E sat quietly for a minute or two,
then suddenly went to pieces. He
began talking again, but his speech was
slurred, unintelligible except for a word
here and there. He dribbled and his
head rolled loosely forward as if his
neck were broken. Then the head came
up with a jerk and he cringed back in
the seat, holding his arms protectively
before his face.
“I see geese!” he screamed. “Geese!
They fly at me. They flap in my face.
Peck at my eyes with their sharp beaks,
screech in my ears. Get them away!
Eeeeeowaaaa! They spit in my face
and screech!”
The men turned to watch the enter-
tainment, offering callous comments.
“There he goes again.”
“Heil Hitler!”
“What is it this time, Statzie?”
“Grab us one for me Sunday dinner,
mate.”
“Could you go a mouse sandwich?”
“Could ’e go a hegg?”
“Watch out, cock” (this to me),
“he’ll have you before a firing squad.”
Statz jumped up and, spitting oaths
between clamped teeth, lurched across
the bar to a door which led to the resi-
dential part of the hotel. Then he
turned and faced the laughing men, in-
flated himself, threw up an arm in the
Nazi salute, bowed low, and made his
exit. This pantomime, which I had
witnessed before, was, I believe, meant
to be insulting, but the men roared
their, appreciation of the diversion.
Picking up his bag and the painting,
I followed Statz into the hall. I watched
him stumble up the three steps toward
a side entrance, then turn right too
early and run into the wall. He swore,
turned the wrong way and came back
toward me.
I stopped him at the top of the steps.
“You forgot your bag,” I said.
St?tz looked at me blankly. “Who are
you?” he said.
“Bailey. We’ve just been talking.”
“Bailey,” he repeated, peering
stupidly. “I do not know you, sir. Pliz
give me my bag.”
On Statz’s right, as he stood sway-
ing, was a staircase leading up into the
darkness of the first floor; on his left
was a full-length mirror with a whisky
advertisement stencilled on it. A man
came out of the bar. He winked at me
and, as he passed, he tapped Statz on
the head with a book. Statz, instan-
taneously enraged, swung around so
that he faced the mirror. “Bastards!”
he roared.
He shaped up at his reflection in the
mirror, made a wild swing at the move-
ment he saw there, splintering the glass,
fragmenting his image. It was a shock-
ing moment. I expected a scream of
pain, but the little man just stood
watching the blood drip from his in-
jured hand, saying to himself, over and
over: “Accept those things which you
cannot change.”
A bubble of hysterical laughter that
had welled up in me at the sight of
him attacking his own image died be-
fore expressed and I stepped toward
him, wanting to help. But Statz shrank
from me, terror in his now sober eyes,
then turned and bolted into the street.
I knew there was no point in following
him.
The circumstances gave that mum-
bled phrase (which I have since dis-
covered is part of the Alcoholics
Anonymous creed) such impact that it
stayed with me long after I left the
hotel. The words plus the example of
the tormented little tailor jolted me
back to my senses. I have no wish to
see geese or paint red and yellow cows.
Statz’s bag I left at Nettle’s, but his
masterpiece is hanging in my bedroom
—as a reminder.

No Change in Tune
By JACK KUNST
INSTALLED as the new director of
the N.S.W. Conservatorium of
Music, Joseph Post says he feels a
little uneasy. But then, he says, he feels
uneasy every time he faces a symphony
orchestra.
Of course, a Conservatorium is not
an orchestra and Joseph Post has a
little more time to think before acting
than he had when he took over the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra from
Silvestri at 75 minutes’ notice in 1959,
or when he conducted the orchestra in
the Bartok Violin Concerto with Max
Rostal in 1955 following Sir Eugene
Goossens’ collapse on the stage.
Sitting in the director’s large office
last week, Joseph Post said: “I’ve
always had to work hard to prepare
my work. One daren’t appear in front
of a symphony orchestra without a
pretty thorough idea of the score. But
then I enjoy working hard at music
—it is both my job and my pleasure.
I consider myself among the lucky
ones to have a profession which is also
my enjoyment to be paid for doing
what I like to do.”
To Joseph Post the appointment to
the Conservatorium is a personal ful-
filment and an accolade to his work.
He said: “I knew that Sir Bernard
Heinze was retiring but I really didn’t
think that I would be a suitable appli-
cant for the job. Three or four of my
good friends thought differently, and
they persuaded me to apply.
“I did so with considerable diffidence
because I felt that I had been away
from academic music for so long that
someone with more skill and experi-
ence in that respect would be better.
I was very surprised, and not a little
flattered, to be chosen for the position.”
Official start of the new appoint-
ment was July 1, but all through June
Joseph Post has *had time to get
organised and to familiarise himself
with the complexities of “the Con.”
What did he find?
He said, “I found a flourishing con-
cern — a music school with a splendid
forward-looking policy, and a fine spirit
of enthusiasm. I can’t imagine that I
will want to make any drastic changes
or institute any important innovations.
“Sir Bernard Heinze has discussed
with me plans he made for the develop-
ment of the Conservatorium — and I
am sure I won’t be able to better these.
Rather, my task will be to see them
brought to fruition.
“For a person like myself who has
been mixed up in performing for so
long, it is not easy to return to the
academic side of music. However, I
hope that my long experience in practi-
cal music-making will prove to be of
some value to the students — especially
those intending to become professional
musicians. I think the production of
professional performers is one of the
main functions of the Conservatorium.”
One of the first things Joseph Post
is anxious to strengthen is the string
teaching. The first step in that direction
was the recent formation by Sir
Bernard Heinze of the Sydney String
Quartet, which at once provides a fine
nucleus of teachers and a chamber-
music body within the Conservatorium.
Joseph Post recalled the days of the
Conservatorium’s first director, Henri
Verbrugghen, when a fine string quartet
led by Verbrugghen made a tremen-
dously valuable contribution to the
teaching and general work of the Con-
servatorium.
Twenty-four concerts were given each
season on Wednesday nights. They con-
sisted of the playing of two quartets
preceded by a talk by Verbrugghen on
the music to be heard.
These lecture concerts were given to
large, discriminating audiences and,
undoubtedly, built up a keen apprecia-
tion of chamber music. A revival of
such a series of concerts might well be
worthwhile with the new quartet.
Joseph Post was a staff conductor
with the Australian Broadcasting Com-
mission from 1932 until this year, and
during that time he conducted all the
ABC orchestras many times. Comment-
ing on this long service, he said: “For
these many years of enjoyable employ-
ment and for all the splendid oppor-
tunities given me I will be eternally
grateful to the ABC. To be associated
with a body of musicians such as the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra in making
great music is a joyous and wonderful
experience.
“But it has its other side. All my life I
have been worried that I might not be
up to the job I had undertaken—that
the performance I was about to conduct!
might somehow fail. Even these days,
before a concert,
“That is why I gave up conducting
operas for the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust a few years ago. The slightest
mishap at a performance and I would
have a sleepless night. But, sleep or no
sleep, the next day early I would have
to be rehearsing again. The strain
became too great and so I gave it up.”
Apropos of opera, Joseph Post said
Sir Bernard’s plan for a complete opera
school within the Conservatorium had
gone a long way toward coming into
being. There seems real hope that it will
start next year.
And in the new wing soon to be
added to the Conservatorium a large
rehearsal stage and other facilities to
house the new opera school will be
included.
This will undoubtedly be a project
dear to the heart of Joseph Post, for
whatever his reputation as a symphony
conductor many people would say he is.
at his best in opera.
LETTER FROM BATH
Perfect Pears
OF all the European cities and towns
which have festivals, Bath is one
of the few to have a specific
atmosphere all its own. Much of this
is due to the setting, much to an
admirable organisation, only a little of
it to the music heard. The importance
of a right setting should not be depre-
ciated. Surrounded on all sides by the
lush green of Somerset stand the enor-
mous terraces of Georgian mansions,
built from local yellow-grey freestone.
Forming straight lines, crescents, and
circuses, they are of a special immo-
bility; they are heavy and solid, without
feeling too weighty, tastefully orna-
mented, apparently all alike and yet
far from monotonous. There are the
bridges which span the peaceful Avon,
and fine homes such as that once occu-
pied by the eccentric William Beckford,
in Lansdowne Crescent, now the resi-
dence of Lord Strathcona, the Festival’s
hospitable chairman, its walls resplen-
dent with Romneys.
The Festival itself, which included
many activities other than music, was
well run. Major musical events took
place in Bath, in Wells cathedral andi
in Bristol’s Colston Hall. In Bath itself,
the theatre, which seats about 1000,
housed “Cosi Fan Tutte” (Menuhin’s

Adler and the Royal Ballet, Covent
Garden; in the two halls of Bath, seat-
ing about 500 listeners each, appeared
the Festival Orchestra, the Czech
Chamber Orchestra, Yehudi Menuhin,
Janet Baker, Hephzibah Menuhin,
Maurice Gendron, Geoffrey Parsons,
Fou Ts’ong, John Williams, Elisabeth
Schwarzkopf, Julian Bream, Peter Pears,
Ravi Shankar, and many others. The
people of Bath, far from overwhelmed
by the influx of visitors from far and
wide, continued in their leisurely way,
polite and friendly, and, in a restrained
way, quite proud of their Festival, which
receives substantial sudsidies from the
City of Bath as well as many industrial
and commercial concerns.
As might be expected, the offerings
at such a Festival vary greatly in
quality and the standard of presenta-
tion. My first concert was a recital by
tenor Peter Pears, with Julian Bream
playing both lute and guitar. I really
have been most fortunate: already, in
Prey and Pears, I have heard two of
the greatest living singers, while Bream
and Williams, whose contracts with
different companies prevent their re-
cordings as a duo-team, are among the
greatest guitarists alive. Pears opened
with a group of madrigals by Philip
Rosseter, John Dowland, and Thomas
Morley. He has a truly exquisite style
and his ebbing diminuendo, of which
even the last faintest breath remains
clearly audible, is little short of miracu-
lous. He sang sitting down, in order to
retain close contact with his accom-
panist.
After the interval, an audience in-
cluding such listeners as Menuhin,
Berkeley, and Ravi Shankar, was
regaled with two fine modern song-
cycles: “Songs of the Half-light,” by
Lennox Berkeley, and “Songs from the
Chinese,” by Britten. Berkeley’s settings
of poems commissioned from Walter
de la Mare in 1965 are, in turn, gently
plaintive and tenderly passionate; they
include some beautifully cadenced vocal
lines and very effective dramatic sec-
tions. The Britten cycle, already known
from recordings, was written in 1958
and is among his best recent work.
There are some allusions to negro music
and jazz and, toward the end of the
cycle, a use of falling cadences that
sounds almost like a parody of one of
Britten’s best-known mannerisms. The
rhythms used to match the gentle texts
are often very attractive and this cycle
also is one, when sung so beautifully,
that I will be happy to hear again.
Bream’s playing, both as an accom-
panist and as a solist with lute and
guitar soli, was about everything one
could wish for. His guitar playing was
not, to me, quite as exciting as had
been John Williams’, but on the lute
he creates enchantment.
The rest of the musical entertain-
ment, or what I heard of it, was
not of quite so high a standard. As is
usually the case at Festivals, there were
events of interest taking place in
several places simultaneously and it
may well be that I could have done
better with a different choice. Thus,
I missed an opportunity of hearing
Janet Baker, who, by all accounts, is a
superlatively fine singer, in a Mahler
cycle at Bristol with the BBC’s “New
Orchestra,” a recently formed training
body for orchestral players. I also
missed a performance by the Royal
Ballet in which Australian-born Jane
Landon received very great praise for
the quality of her dancing in two
spectacular pas seuls in a single per-
formance. What I did hear was, re-
garded charitably, a mixed bag. On
the final evening there was a concert
by the Czech Chamber Orchestra, a
group of redoubtable string players led
by Josef Vlach. Unfortunately, their
skill was not sufficient to make this a
memorable occasion; playing without a
conductor almost any conductor
simply doesn’t work, and although their
attack was clean and precise, the per-
formances were dull and characterless.
This was most painfully noticeable in
Bach’s G minor concerto in which
harpsichordist George Malcolm, on a
fine German instrument, was given
little chance to show his artistry.
The afternoon was the occasion for
one of Yehudi Menuhin’s musical ex-
periments. In order to give fullest ex-
pression to his long-avowed enthusiasm
for Indian music, he had commissioned
Peter Feuchtwanger, a young and
earnest composer with great interest in
Asiatic music, to compose a piece to be
played by violin (Menuhin), sitar,
tabla, and tamboura, the traditional
Indian instruments played by Ravi
Shankar and Alla Rakha. The result,
entitled “Raga Tilang,” was not a suc-
cess, though interesting at first. Yehudi
Menuhin, sitting cross-legged in socks
and Indian shirt, earnestly endeavored
to match his Indian friends, but the
violin proved unequal to the occasion
and, compared with the sitar, sounded
unsubtle and indeed coarse.

show seemed based on an assumption
that he would sing, dance, quip, and
clown, as Sydney’s Channel 9 compere
Don Lane and Melbourne’s Graham
Kennedy are willing and able to. It
was not the Crosby style, and once
this was established his sponsors ap-
peared to lose interest in him as a
property.
Among the formulas behind the
American variety shows we see in Aus-
tralia there is one which could succeed
without risk anywhere. This is the Ed
Sullivan approach. It requires the com-
pere to be well known, not necessarily
in showbusiness, to be shy of limelight
and sparse of speech, and to have vast
sums at his disposal to buy the most
exciting and newsworthy talent of the
moment to top the bill and carry the
others less famous. Possibly this is what
Crosby had in mind, but perhaps it
would have been the only way his show
could have succeeded. But Sullivan's
formula allows him to go far to tape
an act, and there is State Department
help in some instances. Within the U.S.
he can use network taping facilities. He
does not have to stand on one stage
and try to do his best with little or
nothing.
Of the other comperes, Dean Martin
is the most fortunate in that he has
created a public image which he now
exploits. He sings album songs, saunters
around waving a golf club, clutches any
women on the talent list, refers to his
liquor consumption, and smiles, smiles,
smiles. There is good, expensive talent
on the show, but a large percentage of
it is Dean Martin. From comments I’ve
heard, this is a rapidly wearing com-
modity.
The hardest working of all is Danny
Kaye, if you do not count Gleason,
who is a whole show rather than a com-
pere. So is Skelton. Kaye’s show has
long been a favorite with public and
reviewers, from whom I differ. There
are sketches built around Kaye in his
shows, and some are delightful, as was
his character “Jerome,” but some are
too long and unfunny. As a singer, his
wavering nasal voice spoils many tunes.
His interviews with children are good
but over-long for all but the truly senti-
mental. I think of Kaye best as a soft-
shoe man, but this is the talent he dis-
plays least.
Andy Williams is back for another
season with the same show, in which
Andy sings more frequently than Dean
Martin, and not one song at a time, but
in brackets, which is fine if you like
Andy Williams as a singer. I can
imagine many who would not, especially
on the visible medium. Guests are
usually restricted to two, and usually
opposed in character, as Phil Harris
and Liberace were, strong cheese and
watered milk.
From this run down it should be clear
that Australia can have adult variety
shows compered by straight men simi-
lar to Ed Sullivan. Almost anyone
would do, but he would need almost
absolute control and a budget probably
beyond any channel’s dreams or night-
mares.

WHEN a film arrives on a wave of
overseas adulation, one’s attitude
tends to be either one of uncriti-
cal anticipation of greatness or of de-
liberate defensiveness. (I can generally
manage a mysterious mixture of both.)
Anyway, the cries of delight from Lon-
don, where “Alfie” is apparently re-
garded as the cinematic event of the
year, would have been hard to live up
to, and to me the most disappointing
aspect of the film is that it’s neither
masterpiece nor flop. It’s just a fairly
entertaining movie, well acted, often
amusing; it makes an acceptable even-
ing’s entertainment and afterwards
you’ll probably never think of it again.
Pictures like this are the backbone of
the industry, but why all the fuss?
Alfie (just in case you haven’t heard)
is a charming, self-indulgent Cockney,
whose only aim in life appears to be
the pursuit of sexual pleasure without
involvements. Responsibility is foreign
to him, but at the end he is left with
the uneasy feeling that he’s missed
something. This is one of those films
which feels it can safely be daring so
long as it ends with a final, redeeming,
moral headshake.
Alfie, for all his easy charm, is not
an admirable character, but such people
make fine subjects for fiction, and even
in real life are often more entertaining
and likable than the respectable ones.
But the script of “Alfie” never explains
him, never makes him come alive. Why
this unremitting pursuit of birds? Why
does he crave sex but fear love? Even
his irresponsibility is difficult to credit,
since he’s apparently engaged (off-
screen) in solid jobs which he’s able to
keep—something of a feat considering
his almost unceasing sexual athletics and
the fact that he has TB.
Lewis Gilbert, a director best des-
cribed as soundly workmanlike, never
seems too clear about the aims of the
film. Most of the time he treats it as
a light comedy, with Alfie actually
addressing the audience directly a
trick which very soon loses its magic.
Yet there are scenes attempting slice-
of-life realism these do occasionally
come off, more thanks to the players
than to Mr. Gilbert. The richly
romantic Technicolor, too, increases the
unreality it actually manages to
make London look pretty, which is the
last adjective to be applied to that
metropolis.
Fortunately, Lewis Gilbert has the
services of a first-class cast and a script
which is often funny. Michael Caine
can’t make Alfie believable as a human
being, but he’s undeniably a charmer;
Vivien Merchant is genuinely touching
as the lonely woman whose brief as-
sociation with him brings pain and
humiliatiqn. Shelley Winters, Julia
Foster, and Jane Asher are impressive,
and Millicent Martin is pretty good,
considering she’s only on the screen
for about ten seconds.
If “Alfie” came to us with too much
advance build-up, “Masquerade” ar-
rived with practically none, except for
some sniggering, totally misleading last-
minute publicity. Far from being a
come-on, this has turned out to be a
keep-away—which is a pity, for this is a
well-constructed, stylish, thoroughly
diverting film. It’s a pleasant surprise to
see such originality of approach from
Basil Dearden, who is always extremely
professional but not as a rule a par-
ticularly individualistic director.
As a long-time fan of Bette Davis,
I’d go to see the old girl in anything,
and her quietly sinister performance in
“The Nanny” was no disappointment.
Seth Holt has treated the film with an
admirable lack of hysteria, and has


wisely had the overwrought script of
Evelyn Piper’s thriller toned down
after all, the family involved is ratty
enough without being involved with a
homicidal nymphomaniac as a neigh-
bor. This straightforward production
may not be particularly inventive, but
it is entertaining and remarkably
competent.

CHIPS WITH EVERYTHING” is
about a group of raw conscripts
in an RAF camp during their
eight-week period of preliminary train-
ing for National Service. As a descrip-
tion of the day-to-day life of conscripts,
presumably based on Wesker’s own
experience, the play is lively, amusing,
and has the ring of truth.
The original London production
under the direction of John Dexter,
which I saw in 1962, exploited the
documentary interest of the play to the
utmost. Absolute realism was the
order of the day, and the whole pro-
duction had the verve and precision of
a successful military exercise.
Jim Sharman’s production follows the
same general lines. He has had the
assistance of a sergeant in training his
promising cast of young actors in the
technicalities of square bashing. But his
production does not maintain quite the
same cracking pace as that of John
Dexter. Whether this is due to a dif-
ference in theatrical or military tradi-
tion, I do not know.
Although the realistic portrayal of
military training seems to me the
greatest strength of the play, it is not
Wesker’s chief concern. “Chips With
Everything” is a passionate attack on
the English class-system.
Australians, who do live in an egali-
tarian society, can readily sympathise
with Wesker’s point that the English
class structure was a closed system
(surely it has changed now?) from
which it was difficult to escape even
if you wanted to (except by emigrating
to Australia). But Wesker does not
succeed in dramatising this point very
satisfactorily. The lower-class conscripts
are delineated with care and sympathy,
but the officers are rather absurd
figures, merely observed with dislike.
In portraying them, Wesker the drama-
tist became confused with Wesker the
rebel. Also, I suspect it is a romantic
notion of the Wesker of Centre 42,
rather than a fact, that the conscripts,
if not corrupted from above, would sing
folk songs like “The Cutty Wren”
rather than the latest pops.
Francis Flannagan’s production of
“Hamlet” gave evidence of care and
thought and held some interest for the
student, but it remained a workshop
experiment. It was a pity that the
experiment of using modern dress was

not carried through consistently in-
stead of having Hamlet wearing a kind
of Dickensian tutor’s garb in one scene
and a duffle coat in the next, while the
King and Polonius affected some sort
of Ruritanian military uniform and
saluted each other in Nazi fashion. In
any case, the severe sandstone ex-
panses of the Cell Block stage seemed
more suited to a traditional production
than to the informalities of modern
dress.
As often happens in experimental
productions, some of the lesser charac-
ters were interesting. Lyn Munro’s
Ophelia, a young woman with a mind
of her own, was refreshingly different
from the usual stereotype. Charles
Moody’s Polonius managed to be pom-
pous without being a complete dod-
derer. The Play Scene was well done
and the Ghost was more acceptable than
usual. But “Hamlet” is only as good
as the Prince, and Ron Tunstall was
bested by the verse.

The Tomb of the Fuhrer
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
The Last Battle. Cornelius Ryan. Collins.
$5.65.
IF some celestial dramatist had set
out to compose a fitting last act to
the tragedy of World War II in
Europe he could scarcely have im-
proved on what history actually pro-
vided. For 14 days in April, 1945,
illuminated by the arc lamps of its
own blazing buildings, Berlin held the
centre of the stage, the last battlefield
and the tomb of the Fuhrer himself.
Since H. R. Trevor-Roper pub-
lished “The Last Days of Hitler”
nearly 20 years ago there have been
numerous accounts of the battle for
Berlin. But the story has a perennial,
nightmarish sort of fascination. It is
simply almost impossible to conceive of
a city of eight million people being a
battleground; the miracle is that
(though the figures are far from con-
clusive) not more than about 100,000
civilians died in the final holocaust,
and of them it has been estimated that
20,000 collapsed from heart attacks
and 6000 committed suicide. Berlin was
existing on three levels during those
apocalyptic days. At ground level,
among the gaunt skeletons and buildings
and acres of rubble, was the battle itself
where Red Army tanks and troops
crashed through the ramshackle de-
fences manned largely by old men and
boys of the Volkssturm. Below ground,
crammed in suffocating air-raid shel-
ters and cellars, in railway tunnels,
and in the bowels of great concrete
flak towers, were the civilian popula-
tion some terrified by the spectre of
Russian vengeance, some apathetic,
some, with the traditional bitter humor
of the Berlin Cockney, covering the walls
with rude anti-Nazi slogans while the
buildings crumbled about their ears.
And lower still, in the nethermost
air-conditioned, carpeted, map-hung
depths of the Chancellery bunker, was
the dream world of Hitler and his re-
maining courtiers a world where
astrological predictions and legends of
Frederick the Great jostled aside the
grim realities of military reports, where
the Fuhrer with his puffy, dough-
white face, glazed eyes, and uncon-
trollably trembling hands moved
non-existent armies about vanished
battlefronts, screamed orders and im-
precations to which no one listened any
more, and heard the unbelievable news
that Himmler, der treue Heinrich, the
sea-gfeen incorruptible of Nazism, was
trying to open peace negotiations with
the Allies.
All this is the stuff of tremendous
drama and Cornelius Ryan does it full
justice. Five years of research went into
“The Last Battle,” during which Ryan
interviewed scores of soldiers, civilians,
and Nazi officials who were witnesses
to the agony of Berlin. But the book
is a good deal more than a chronicle
of the final battle for the city. The
battle itself occupies only the climactic
chapters of a sweeping narrative that
begins with the two mighty Allied of-
fensives toward Berlin the Rus-
sians smashing through their bridge-
heads over the Oder in the east, the
Americans and British rolling irresist-
ibly toward the Elbe in the west. Ryan
was the first Western war historian al-
lowed access to the archives of the
Soviet Defence Ministry. He talked at
length with Marshals Koniev, Rokossov-
sky, and Chuikov, and he provides a
valuable insight into Russian motives
and strategy in the hidden power
struggle between the Allies during the
final stages of the war.
F OR > as Ryan reminds us, the Cold
War began weeks before Red Army
tanks ploughed down the Unter den
Linden and the hammer and sickle was
hoisted over the Brandenburg Gate.
Stalin, dourly suspicious of Western
aims and fearing to the last moment
that the West would make a separate
peace, was determined to occupy as
much of Germany as possible before
the last shot was fired. For some time
it appeared that the German collapse
would develop into a headlong race for
Berlin. On the Western side there were
frayed tempers and hot words as Mont-
gomery, backed by Churchill, pleaded
in vain for Eisenhower’s permission to
crash on into northern Germany with
Berlin as his goal. To Churchill, as to
Stalin, the Reich capital was of
supreme political importance apart
altogether from its military value. In
the event it was Omar Bradley’s U.S.
12th Army Group that first reached the
Elbe in mass and would have made the
drive on Berlin if it had come. But the
drive did not come. The Anglo-
American forces halted at the line of
the Elbe, leaving the Red Army to
steamroller into the city from east,
north, and south.
The decision to come to a stop on the
Elbe, which was to have momentous
consequences in post-war years, was
reached after much heart-burning in
the Western camp. It is, of course,
understandable • in the light of the
agreement already reached with Russia
about the carving-up of Germany into
the Allied zones of occupation. Eisen-
hower saw no point in incurring
another 100,000 casualties (the estimate
of his intelligence staff) in conquering
territory that would have to be handed
over to the Russians later. He also
feared the possibility of unpleasant inci-
dents if the two armies collided head-on
in the scramble for victory. Political
advantages weighed much less with
Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower
than with their British counterparts.
Anyway, the Americans could argue
that Berlin, though left deep within
Red-occupied country, was to be the
subject of a separate system of divided
control among the Allies.
Ryan has done an excellent job of
drawing together the threads of this
tangled skein of bickering and bargain-
ing that lay behind the final assault on
Berlin. In popular war history it makes
a valuable supplement to the concluding
chapters of Chester Wilmot’s “The
Struggle for Europe.” But I expect that
what will appeal most to the general
reader is Ryan’s vivid, often harrowing,
re-creation of the atmosphere of Berlin’s
last hours.
Marvellous Melbourne
By DAVID MARTIN
Humping My Bluey. Graham Mclnnes.
Hamish Hamilton. $3.15.
AUSTRALIANS in their sixties are
now writing their memoirs and
unlikely places assume a retro-
spective glamor. Graham Mclnnes
endows Melbourne just after the first
Great War with an aura of adventure.
Elderly gentlemen between Frankston
and Kew will read this book, in which
no particular bluey is humped, with
nostalgia, while their grandsons will be
surprised at how little has changed.
Judging by the fact that the present
volume takes the author only into his
early twenties, and that it was preceded
by one dealing with his younger boy-
'hood, we may expect it to be followed
by a long series. I doubt whether I
shall feel that I have to read them all,
notwithstanding that the opening instal-
ment seems to have sent some English
reviewers into raptures. Mr. Mclnnes’
observations on people and events do
not move me, but he has a pleasant
talent for evoking the local past. He
writes with his mind on the British
reader, calls the lower end of Sydney
Road the Shepherd’s Bush of Mel-
bourne, and includes maps of his city,
of Victoria, and Tasmania in the style
of a guide book. Since the material is,
in its own right, rather unexciting, and
since cliche gaily pursues cliche across
the pages, “Humping My Bluey” could
be called unrequired reading were it


not for a kind of uninhibited directness
and some interesting sidelights on
Angela Thirkell, the novelist, who is the
writer’s mother.
It appears that this formidable but
not strikingly maternal lady was already
a leading character in “The Road to
Gundagai,” Opus I in the Mclnnes
saga. It also appears that her son loves
her less than passionately, for she didn’t
care a rap for glamor and youthful sus-
ceptibilities. Her untidy house in Grace
Street, within cycling distance of Caul-
field racecourse, hardly provided the
ideal background for a lively Scotch
College boy, though up to a point it
seems to have suited Captain Thirkell
pretty well. A Tasmanian with a fine
war record, he comes through as a
pathetically helpless civilian who never
recovered from the effects of the Wall
Street crash on the Australian motor
industry, as a lenient but unsupportive
father, and as a part-time husband who
quickly reverted to absent-minded
bachelorhood after Angela’s departure
for London and the world of Foyle’s.
“Is his Mum dotty?” one of Graham’s
schoolmates asks another as they are
watering the daisies on the back lawn,
to get this classical answer, “No, but
she’s very highly educated.”
rpHE lad, undauntable, looks for his
emotional and social satisfactions
somewhere else. He finds them in Brigh-
ton in the plenty-daughtered household
of the Timmins family, presided over by
a delightful woman whose father was
Theodore Fink, the chairman of the
Melbourne “Herald.” The story then
becomes a string of prefect flirtations,
tough fruit-picking holidays, and esca-
pades of minor naughtiness in two
neighboring States until it leads us to
Ormond College. Here it picks up again.
The picture we get of a Protestant for-
tress, governed by its master in the
spirit of a crofters’ school, has the
brutal charm of an authentic period
piece; even the inane initiation rights
become quite amusing. They, too, don’t
seem to have changed much, except
that the freshers of this earlier genera-
tion, unlike those of the present, were
not chased round the Carlton Cemetery
encouraged by flourbags.
The author can claim distant cousin-
ship with Rudyard Kipling and Stanley
Baldwin. He is too wise and un-
affected to make much of it, though
he may have inherited certain
characteristics from his two kinsmen.
Like Kipling, he suspects the romantic,
only to fall prey to it in an inverted
form, and like Honest Stan he is as
pragmatic in his attitudes as could be.
From his mother he derives the irony
which just saves his work from being
altogether too trivial and a fair eye for
local atmosphere. He even essays an
experiment in the genuinely dramatic,
right at the beginning, when we see the
boy escaping narrowly from a perverted
policeman—the same policeman who is
in charge of the station to which his
embarrassed father takes him the next
day to ask for an inquiry. The child
MARCH
Coughing, the last of winter stumbles
Over blackslimed ice that leaks
Secretly into asphalt bogs,
Stained hands clenching shawled rags.
In yards and corners, snow disguised
Takes cover in its stubborn war
With shovels tossing rocksalt chunks
Under the tyres of stinking trucks.
Houses lean exhausted, feet
Fast in mud: the whole town founders.
From sunless months, potatoes, muck
And cabbagestalks the ground is sick.
Yawning, sallow as the street,
We walk home slowly from the park
Stretch like the dirty trees, and wait
With them for the worn sky to part
Its seamless cloth: wait for the touch
Of light on eyelids, to turn south
With trees, soil and shabby town
A tranced face to the new sun.

knows he is the same, but is afraid to
say so.
The man best qualified to review this
book would be George Johnston, whose
Brother Jack grew up in the same place
at the same time, if not in the identical
environment. Jack would probably have
agreed with the laconic sentence which
defines the year 1930 as the one in
which the post-war period ended and
the pre-war period began. I had never
thought of it like that, but it is true.
Australian Gothic
By ALAN BRISSENDEN
Kylie Tennant. Margaret Dick. Rigby.
$2.75.
KYLIE TENNANT writes big books.
They spread and sprawl over New
South Wales. They teem with
people. The main characters are out-
siders, often concerned with survival in
the face of a hostile or indifferent
society. None of them goes under, but
neither do they attain their ideals; they
keep going, with optimism. They never
reach tragic stature, perhaps because or
tragedy one has to get beyon t e
merely rea .
When this realism works best is when
it forms an ambience in which out-
landish figures move; Miss Tennants
most memorable characters are her
Gothic grotesques—minor ones like
Mrs. Malloy, the rich old eccentric of
“Tiburon” who gives lifts to bagmen
in her chauffeur-driven limousine, or
major ones like Snow and Dapcy in
“The Battlers.” When they arejplaced
in the unnervingly real country land-
scapes of these early books, a balance is
achieved which enlivens the whole
novel. And in “The Battlers” especially
the cool detachment of the writer allows
her bitterness at society and her affirma-
tion of living, even at the lowest level,
to emerge strongly.
It is this persistently positive attitude
which Margaret Dick finds the most
notable element of Kylie Tennant’s
work, giving the novels a unity they
might otherwise appear to lack. She
places Miss Tennant in the stream of
modern writing, which includes Camus
and the existentialists rather than Stein-
beck and the social realists, though
where the existentialists end in despair
she clings on to hope. Despite the claims
put forward by Miss Dick, the novels
themselves just won’t hold up the weight
of metaphysical expression she wants
them to bear.
They are indeed about “a search for
meaning and significance in life,” but
only “The Battlers” presents this theme

successfully. In the others it is lost
beneath the action, the multiplicity of
characters, the careful realism, and the
conscious poeticising. This is not to deny
the accurate presentation of things
observed, the frequent humor, or the
gusto' of individual parts of some of

Sad Harvest
By JAMES KIRKUP
New Poems, 1965. Editor, G. V. Wedg-
wood. Hutchinson. $3.
MAY God preserve me from my
friends” should be the watch-
word of everyone who has to
compile an anthology. It is a motto
especially appropriate to the editors of
this semi-official, now biennial,
anthology, who have often entertained
us, in their introductions, by their
accounts of hasty, last-minute rummages
for poems how they wrote begging
for work from friends who had simply
not thought of contributing. The poems
thus raked together were inevitably poor
stuff inferior things already rejected
by a score of editors but which the
poets were reverently hoarding for
publication in a posthumous volume.
Dr. C. V. Wedgwood seems to
have something of the same kind of
problem. In her lively and gracious
introduction she says:
When I was asked to edit the
anthology for 1964-5 ... I began
at once to write down a short list
which soon turned into a long
one of the poets whose recent
work I wanted to include. Some
were famous, some were relatively
unknown, some were well estab-
lished, others still very young. It
was in my, perhaps prejudiced,
. opinion an impressive, well-
balanced list, and I even got as far
as writing letters to two of the
poets on it.
This gives very nicely the modest,
kind, and unpretentious tone of the
introduction. But* one wonders, should
editors be modest, kind, and unpre-
tentious? Shouldn’t they rather be
ambitious, cruel, and megalomaniac?
They need to be when dealing with
poets, who are usually far from modest,
kind, and unpretentious, but rather a
deceitful, money-grubbing crew with one
eye on fame and the other on the
nearest rival. Perhaps this is why
the present volume is comparatively
tame and lukewarm: Dr. Wedgwood
has been too civilised and cultured and
human, and really too nice altogether.
She wins our sympathy at once by
telling us she is not a poet herself:
thank God for that! One rival the
less! (murmur the Immortals). But,
like everyone, she “knows what she
likes,” and what she likes is often
admirable up to a point. (In these
democratic days, everyone feels he has
a right to an opinion, especially on
poetry, or any other subject he knows
nothing about.) Dr. Wedgwood’s
relaxed and amiable approach makes
for a wide variety of choices and a very
representative selection of the poetry
being written today, a selection merci-
fully free from editorial whimsies,
literary theories, and modish prejudices,
anthology contains about six or seven,
two poems I really like. But this
anthology contains about six or seven.
Perhaps if Miss Wedgwood had allowed
some of the better poets to be repre-
sented by more than one poem, the
standard would have shot up. As it is,
among one hundred and twenty con-
tributors, there is a large proportion—
about sixty percent —that should never
have seen print.
The women poets, as usual, are ex-
cessively feeble. One begins to weary of
Stevie Smith’s one-string fiddle and
the anaemic niceties of Elizabeth Jen-
nings (“The JEN Club Pennings?”).
But there is one fine poem, “Celebra-
tion,” by a woman poet whom I regard
as the foremost in England now
Gloria Evans Davies, an inspired Welsh
bard. She has feeling, guts, and form.
I was also pleased to find a superb
poem by Charles Higham, “Rushcutter’s
Bay.” It is the most vivid and authentic
picture of the Australian landscape in
verse that I have ever read: though I
have never seen Australia, I am sure it
would be like this, just as I feel it
would be like the pictures of Sydney
Nolan and the novels of Patrick White.
To express the essence of a place is
difficult: this poem also expresses the
essence of a continent.
I like the frank, straightforward but
deeply poetic work of Charles Causley,
Clifford Dyment, Peter Redgrove, and
Douglas Livingstone, all well repre-
sented here. But honestly, the rest
WHAT’ S wrong with people these
days? What’s the matter with their
poems? The poetry is in the people,
and in this decade so far the British
have not been at their best: one feels
in most of these poems a sourness, a
bad temper, and a sheer lack of emotion
and imagination. Most poetry that gets
printed in England today is dry-as-dust
linguistic choppings and changings by
our dreary provincial academics. It
is the verse of professors of poetry, the
lines of lectures of Englit. There are
few poems in this anthology by real
people: just read the notes on con-
tributors, in which the poets try vainly
to persuade us of their reality and
humanity: for example, Laurence Lerner
says coyly: “He is now living in Hove,
Sussex, and is married, with four
delightful but quite unliterary children.”
So what?
The notes on contributors are
such things, really necessary? are
most revealing, for they show a depress-
ing conformity. I was amused to find
that the editor, who had gaily accepted
the fanciful account I had written of
my birth, had cut out the most impor-
tant part of my biography, which I had
taken great pains to compose for her:
“Unmarried, with no children.”
THE CRAB
I
The crab is no metaphysician, and I envy
him.
Climbing like a mechanical toy,
gripping the smooth surface
scrubbed by many tides,
he pauses where my human shadow
falls,
then scurries obliquely over the brim.
II
Sideways crab on a sloping rock,
you tell me indirection is another way
of living.
I walk backwards, myself,
and falling into crevasses
find that stumbling is another way of
seeing.

Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon are the main grapes used
for making Claret and Burgundy. At Yalumba Cellars
these grapes are gently crushed through a special roller
mill to avoid stalkiness and the “must” is fermented in
contact with the red skins. Fermentation is allowed to
proceed at higher temperatures than with white wines in
order that the natural pigment of the skins will impart
more colour to the wines and add body and bouquet.
Tannin and other extracts absorbed from the skins during
fermentation make Clarets and Burgundies more robust
than the paler Rose’s or white table wines.

Observed
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
The Mandarin and Other Stories. Eca de
Queiroz. Bodley Head. $2.65.
ECA DE QUEIROZ, generally
regarded as the greatest Portu-
guese novelist of the nineteenth
century, has only begun recently to be
translated into English. Trained as a
lawyer, he became a diplomat, a call-
ing particularly sympathetic to great
writers.
De Queiroz in this group of short
stories and one novella adopts an ironic
stance. Each of these stories could have
the letters Q. E. D. affixed after them.
In each he pursues with Euclidean pre-
cision the line along which a particular
character’s passion or weakness is lead-
ing. This line inevitably conies into col-
lision with reality, which proves much
more powerful than the aspirations of
men. The artistry of de Queiroz lies
in that the reader cannot predict the
point where these two lines of force
will intersect.
For all their scepticism these stories
have the air of a fable, a trance in
which reality works to its absurd con-
clusions. In “The Mandarin” an im-
poverished clerk is visited by the devil,
who appears in a top hat and tempts
the clerk to ring a small bell lying on a
dictionary. As the clerk rings the bell
a Mandarin in distant China hears the
remote tinkle and falls dead in his gar-
den. The clerk inherits the Mandarin’s
millions, only to find himself haunted
by hallucinations, in which the Man-
darin appears lying paunch upward,
clasping a paper parrot.
J)E QUEIROZ is an exponent of the
Jonsonian Comedy of Humors. Each
character has an identifiable formula,
even if it is quite a subtle formula. All
behaviour may be related back to this
basic formula or “humor” no matter
how inexplicable it may at first seem.
Narratives written in this manner tend
to become an argument in which ideas
are worked out. Perhaps the supreme
example of this in the novel is
“Madame Bovary,” where the heroine’s
selfishness brings nemesis, which is total
and absolute. A large amount of very
great literature belongs to this class, but
I am excited most by novels and stories
where reality is presented for itself and
not as the demonstration of an argu-
ment, where passion is more than just
a geometrical problem.
Modern science now regards the
Euclidean straight line and point as
myth and oversimplification. De
Queiroz ultimately remains an observer
of passion, rather than an actor, and
just as his characters are trapped, so
he is trapped in his own highly polished
scepticism, his Euclidean geometry of
character.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Don't Devalue!
THE case against a devaluation of sterling is overwhelm-
ing. Of all the ways to solve Britain’s economic crisis
and ease its balance of payments problem, devaluing
sterling seems the most unlikely. Certainly there will be
mounting pressure on the pound in coming months as the
sterling speculation season mounts to its normal September
climax. But there is too much at stake, not only for Britain
but for the rest of the world, to allow sterling to fall.
The Europeans have a very large stake in the survival of
the pound; they would stand to lose heavily on their British
loans if sterling went down, quite apart from the fact that
British goods would offer more severe price competition
against European goods after a devaluation. And apart
from all this, a devaluation would mean that no longer
could the European bankers continue to force their economic
attitudes on an obedient borrower.
It is significant that Britain no longer gives the Europeans,
who are supplying massive financial support for sterling,
any guarantee of repayment in the currency of the lender
as a protection against a sterling devaluation. The guaran-
tees were dropped when other countries, particularly the
Commonwealth, protested that they were receiving no guar-
antees for their significant efforts in bolstering sterling by
keeping the bulk of their foreign reserves in London and
that either the guarantees should become universal or should
be dropped entirely.
Australian officials are convinced that sterling will not
go down and the Government is firmly committed to
helping sterling by keeping the bulk of Australia’s foreign
reserves in London (where by the way they are now attract-
ing handsome interest rates).
In any event, sterling cannot be unilaterally devalued;
and the other devaluations that would follow immediately if
sterling went down could mean that most of the world’s
trading currencies, including the dollar, would be devalued,
too.
For Britain itself, the effect of a devaluation would be
clearly inflationary at a time when deflation is the required
economic policy, and so would be self-defeating. The incomes
policy would be completely destroyed under the pressure
of higher costs of imported food and raw materials; manu-
facturing industry would be given another respite from the
need to smarten itself up, because prices of its exports would
automatically be more competitive than those of countries
that had not devalued.
So a devaluation would give Britain little more than
extra breathing space in which to cure her economic ills; and
there are far better ways of giving her that space than
devaluation.
Seven for Uniformity
ONE of the main hopes for this week’s Perth meeting of
the State and Commonwealth Attorneys-General is
that from it will emerge, at last, genuine uniformity
in the seven Companies Acts now in operation in Australia.
Since the uniform Acts were introduced in 1961, all States
except South Australia have maintained that uniformity
(even the Commonwealth has eventually got around to
keeping in step despite its mounting reputation for dilatori-
ness) except on such minor issues as whether articles of
MEN AND MATTERS
THE coming flotation of the Darrell
Lea confectionery group with an
issue of slm. in 50-cent shares
will be the second time the Lea family
have gone public.
This time the company being floated
is under the chairmanship of 38-year-
old Darrell Bernard Lea, the youngest
of the four sons of the group’s founder.
The others are Montague (the oldest
brother, who first led the Leas to mar-
ket four years ago), Maurice, and
Harris.
The current float is of their Sydney-
based interests; the other took most of
the Melbourne ones through the 1962
listing of General Foods Corporation,
the Twisties maker. The following
year the Lea family, represented on
the General Foods board by Montague
and Maurice, increased their already
major share holding when General
Foods bought the Leas’ Victorian
candy-making company, Montague
Bernard & Co. Pty. Ltd. Then, after
only two years of public life, the Leas
sold their shares to British Tobacco,
which bought out the remaining min-
ority holdings last year.
But so far there are no signs that
British Tobacco is waiting to snaffle
the latest float, which covers the Darrell
Lea, Sydney, manufacturing operations
(now under one roof at Kogarah) and
the retailing of chocolates and confec-
tionery in Sydney, Wollongong, New-
castle, and Melbourne. Bernard Lea,
the current driving
force in the family,
so far has no Brit-
ish Tobacco over-
tures to report.
The Darrell Lea
business has cer-
tainly grown under
the control of the
four brothers. Their
father first tested
the market back in
1902 in W.A., S.A.,
and Victoria, and finally came to
establish himself in Sydney. The
present business, however, was started
in 1926, and in 1935 was converted to
a proprietary company. Maurice was
senior executive from 1926 to 1965,
when Bernard assumed the chair.
TWO months ago the AMP Society
held its annual elections of direc-
tors; last week the Society’s
chairman retired for a highly predict-
able reason—he had reached the retir-
ing age.
So the Society’s board appointed its
deputy chairman, Mr. Vincent Fairfax,
to sit at the top of the table and in-
vited well-respected Sydney business-
man Mr. Donald Junor to take the
vacant board seat.
When Mr. Junor comes up to face
policyholders for the first time he will
Darrell Lea
Donald Junor
V. C. Fairfax
have been a director for 10 months,
and even if his impressive credentials
(FCA, chairman and managing direc-
tor of Mauri Bros., and chairman of
Nightingale) were not enough to en-
sure his election, his experience in the
job will certainly give him an edge
over any possible contender.
But is this the way policyholders
want their mutual organisation to be
run? Would it have been so terrible-
for Mr. C. G. Crane, who has served
the society so well as a director for 11
years and chairman for six, to have
stepped down two months ago so that
policyholders could have at least had
the opportunity of considering a suc-
cessor without being presented with a
fait accompli?
Of course, it may be that policy-
holders’ opinions do not matter on such
questions as to who should control the
institution they own.


association should be typed or printed. But South Australia
had stood out on two fairly important matters —the com-
pulsory retiring age of 72 and the eligibility of anyone to be
a proxy at a company meeting.
Reasons for the Adelaide objections seemed to be on
questions of dignity that were close to the hearts of the
venerable legislators who redded in that State’s Liberal-
Country League dominated Upper House. It was an imper-
tinence to require septuagenarian directors to come up for
annual re-election as all the other States agreed, and it
was unthinkable that any bounder could attend a com-
pany meeting on behalf of a shareholder and kick up a
fuss when he did not even own any shares himself.
The new Labor administration in South Australia will
probably take the opportunity of bringing that State into
line at the same time as all of them apply the results of
this week’s meeting to their companies legislation. And the
changes may be significant, as they follow many years of
intensive study of the U.K. Jenkins Committee report and
its appropriateness for Australia.
One of the main matters on this week’s agenda is con-
sideration of the whole of the 9th schedule of the Act that
deals with company reporting. Apart from discussing the
addition of new requirements, such as revealing group turn-
over, total emoluments of directors, “inside trading” in
company shares by directors, and publication of private
companies results along the lines of the recent U.K. Act,
the Attorneys-General will look at the anomalies that have
been discovered in the five years that the schedule has been
operating. Many of these are simple matters of terminology,
such as balance sheets at present being required to show the
value of shares listed on stock exchanges while profit and
loss accounts refer specifically to shares listed on Common-
wealth of Australia stock exchanges, so that the earnings of
the one cannot be related to the value of the other in com-
panies like CSR, which have shareholdings in New Zealand,
for example.
Listing Plessey Pacific
IF the Attorneys-General are looking to Britain for some
of the improvements currently being considered for
our Companies Acts, the London Stock Exchange could
look at some Australian listing requirements when next it
considers improving its own.
The reason preventing the British Plessey Co. Ltd. from
being listed on Australian stock exchanges, following its
takeover of Ducon some years ago, is simply that the
company does not want to have to meet the more stringent
Australian requirements of revealing service agreements with
senior Plessey executives. The company hopes that a com-
promise can be arrived at soon.
But whether the British parent gets listed or not, there
will eventually be one Plessey company on local stock ex-
changes. The group hopes that its local subsidiary, Plessey
Pacific, should be listed here by offering the public about
a 30 percent interest, but not for at least two years. By
this time Plessey Pacific should be in a position to “make
shareholders happy right from the beginning,” after absorb-
ing all the goodwill involved in its Ducon acquisition.
Its dependence on entertainment is diminishing. Now
Plessey is looking for growth in industrial and defence
fields. While its product interest is widely spread, 40 per-
cent of the U.K. business is now with the PMG.
This is probably the direction in which Plessey Pacific
will head, too. Telephone and Electrical Industries Pty., part
of the Plessey Telecommunications group, is already princi-
pal supplier of message registers to the Australian Post Office
and exports even to Taiwan.
The company has shown great skill in gathering a local
board of directors that should make it one of the best-advised
companies in its major fields of operations—defence and the
PMG —in Australia; Sir Giles Chippindall, a former head
of the PMG, is chairman, and Sir Frederick Scherger, the
former armed services chief, is a director. And as a handy
bonus on the side of Plessey’s wide interests in aircraft com-
munications, Sir Giles is a former and Sir Frederick is the
current chairman of TAA.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
F Or the economy : The Australian wool cheque
for the 1965-66 selling season reached $710.9 million,
$27.1 million or 3.7 percent down on the previous year.
Bales sold, at 4,667,629, fell back by 8.2 percent, but
average greasy prices were about 5 percent above

share markets, although with keener selection. Oils have
grown a little stronger. A careful firmness distinguishes
industrials; leaders look more uniform.
It’s a seven percent Bank Rate (and far from un-

June trade figures, the crucial sterling position, and
further squeeze moves overhang dealings . . . Interest
rates and money tightness also make the most contri-
bution to Wall Street's nervousness.
F Or companies : After its last year’s practically
steady profit, CSR believes earnings will fall in 1966-67;

PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
At Home with Cost-Benefit
THE latest in a commendable series
of Treasury publicatons is en-
titled “Investment Analysis.” It
raises great issues of national policy.
Is the pay-off period the best way of
deciding whether to install that extra
plastic moulding machine? Will Mr.
Court ever be able to justify a Com-
monwealth grant for the Ord? Is the
Loan Council an inefficient way of
allocating moneys for public works?
But rather than rush off into these
issues, it may be more worth while to
have a simple-minded look at the
central technique expounded, attempt-
ing to put it in a somewhat less bureau-
cratic language. The technique is the
“discounted cash flow” method of com-
paring the benefits and costs of pro-
jects. The example is not, I hope, too
homely and personal. I can claim at
least that it is genuine.
I am in the process of building a
house in cold, costly Canberra and two
projects suggest themselves a solar
hot-water system and oil heating.
There are cheaper alternative ways of
arranging to be able to get water hot
and the house warm simple electric
systems —but they are more expensive
to run. How to weigh the stream of
future savings against the immediate
extra initial expense? And how to de-
cide which to go for if the bank
manager imposes a simple budgetary
constraint.
Following Treasury, I can apply dis-
counted cash-flow techniques to measure
the benefit-cost ratios. The extra initial
cost of the solar hot-water system will
be about $lOO. But it will save $3O a
year utilising Canberra’s plentiful sun-
shine and saving on its costly electricity,
though let me assume it costs me $5 a
year in fiddling around, replacing the
broken glass panels and the like, and
that its efficiency diminishes at a cost
of a dollar a year as the reflector loses
its shine. The net cash flow of benefits
therefore goes: $25, $24, $23, $22, $2l,
$2O, $l9 . . . the $lOO is recouped or
paid off in just over four years.
What about the other project—the
oil heating instead of simple electric
radiators? This would cost initially an
extra investment of $2OO, the oil can
and burner costing this much more
than electric radiators. But it would
cost $5O a year less to run, fuel oil
being cheaper than power. So there is
a net cash flow of benefits of $5O going-
on undiminished year by year. There
would be a simple payoff in dead on
four years.
My architect told me I’d do better
with the oil heating than with the solar
hot water. He needs to learn some
economics!
First of all there is the interest cost.
Tying up money in gadgetry costs
money, either because I have to pay-
bank interest or else because I could
be earning something with it —say
7 percent a year. This means that
future savings (or benefits) have to be
discounted by an interest calculation
in order to allow for this and make
them comparable with the initial sum.
Using this rate of interest, the dis-
counted cash flow becomes $23, $2l,
$l9, $l6, $l4, $l2, $ll, $lO . . . for
the solar system, and $47, $44, $4l, $3B,
$35 . . . for the oil heater. The payoff
period becomes longer for both, though
the oil heater still pays itself off more
quickly than the solar water-heating.
But our architect has more to learn.
FOR there is also the problem of
the phasing and the life spans of
the two pieces of machinery to
be brought into our calculations. We
can fairly assume that the solar hot-
water system will go on producing
savings for many years, though after
fifteen or so the interest discount rate
will have reduced them to insignificance
from our 1966 viewpoint. But pursu-
ing the discounted benefits up to the
end of the ’7os and adding up each
year’s now-comparable figure, we get
a total benefit of $l5l, which can be
compared directly with our initial cost
of $lOO. We have a benefit cost ratio
of 1.51.
The sun won’t get obsolete and elec-
tricity prices will probably not fall
much, but oil house heating will prob-
ably be put out of business by natural
gas. In, say, six years’ time, shall we
assume. So we add up the discounted
benefits from the oil heater’s six years
of life—s 47 plus $44 plus $4l, $3B, $35
plus equals $238. And the $4O we
may expect to get as our trade-in on
the changeover to natural gas might
be $4O or discounted to present values,
«.r»Te ta a . coun J e “ .? add U P
to $266. Against the $2OO initial cost,

Stock Exchange Malaise
Hammers have never been music
in the ears of stockbrokers. No
less the thuds of those now re-
sounding around the stately but doomed
Victorian edifice of the ANZ Bank at
351 Collins Street, as wreckers clear a
path for the new stock exchange build-
ing. Let us face it, Melbourne’s brokers
have known better times. If not two
a penny, their seats are now worth a
mere $17,000, even the biggest broking
firm has forgone the publication of
its annual investment bible this year,
backroom boys have been getting the
axe as never before. In happier days
a stock exchange to match Sydney’s
palace in O’Connell Street was not only
a must, its realisation was eminently
practicable. But brokers now having to
find the $4 million half-share toward its
cost have been stopping up their ears as
Whelan goes to work.
In private most brokers blame the
Government’s insatiable appetite for
loan money for the malaise in stock
exchange activity these past few years.
In a recent address Mr. Ricketson
admitted “the undeniable attraction”
of interest rates on fixed interest
securities and that this “has doubtless
diverted funds from equity investment.”
On the other hand, he said the while,
“investors requiring fixed interest
securities would be unwise if they did
not avail themselves of present market
conditions. This situation would not
be allowed to obscure the very reason-
able prices at which shares in profit-
able, soundly financed, and expanding
companies can be acquired today. The
share market is particularly favorable
to the medium and long-term investor,
but there is also ample scope for the
equity investor primarily interested in
immediate income rather than the
promise of capital and income gains
in future years.”

brokers. Though, admittedly, some of
their circulars proclaim them from
time to time, most of those I’ve seen
lately haven’t been talking about the
market prospects at all, but offering
their clients long and learned essays
on such non-market topics as the wheat
situation and the world’s shortage of
capital. What is more, we seldom find
any of the brokers attempting to inter-
pret the market situation, in all its
political and economic relationships,
these days. It is as if most brokers have
given the game of appetite-whetting
away. And this might also be said of
the Stock Exchange itself. The Press
seldom sees the committee over an
after-hours drink these days, so dry is
the state of the equities cupboard.
Some local brokers, wide awake to
the possibilities, must be excepted from
this, such as the firm that in April
depicted Australia as a “fairytale
island,” listing its immense natural re-
sources, efficient primary industry,
and “sophisticated” secondary industry,
and pointing out that prices of shares
here are cheaper (on recognised aver-
ages) than in Britain, the U.S., the
Continent, and Japan. “Naturally, of
course, this is only a fairytale,” ex-
claimed the circular; “Or is it? Ask
us.” Who wouldn’t buy equities after
such an appeal!
J’VE had a whip round the brokers to
see if perchance any of them have
issued statements interpreting the effect
of the basic-wage increase on market
prospects for their clients, but have
failed to find one. Maybe their thoughts
were too depressing, following on the
earlier intimation that company profits
fell in the March quarter this year. Or
perhaps they have preferred to wait for
any Budget concessions which would
make the outlook for equities more
assuring. Against this I did get an
admission from one broker that the
market would prosper between now and
the Budget, and one notes, of course,
that, helped considerably by the heavily
weighted BHP, the Melbourne leaders’
index has gained a new peak for the
year.
One might have thought that, with
the basic-wage going up $2, the Federal
Treasurer in a liberal mood for his first
Budget, and this being an election year,
a much more favorable situation was
emerging for equities. There are few
overt inflationary signs about as yet
which brokers could advertise, but it
doesn’t take all that perception to see a
few near the surface, and at least some
discussion of them in brokers’ circulars
would seem appropriate.
If we are going to get even a
moderate inflation, this would be the
time to forget the meagre yields now
offering on blue-chip stocks, I mean
recession-proof stocks with a growth
potential, and fill one’s stocking with
them. You might do better doing this
than, say, following Speculator’s Diary
or buying metals shares at their current
inflated levels, which is what most in-
vestors still seem to be doing.

What Chance for Equities?
By CROESUS
IF one thing more than another has been bedevilling equity investment these past
few years it is high interest rates, not only on competitive investments such as
Government loans and fixed interest stocks generally but also on borrowings for
working capital purposes.
The complex of forces causing high
interest rates would seem to have had
some solid reinforcements lately. One
of these is the rise in the basic wage,
which is going to put heavy pressure
on available supplies of working capi-
tal as well as on profit margins, and
by this route on business expectations
and thus through to private investment.
Another is the gap opening up between
heavier loan requirements and the loan
market’s potential. A third is the
general rise in interest rates overseas,
which cannot fail to rub off to some
extent on Australia. (At the time of
writing a rise from 6 to 7 percent in
British Bank Rate was mooted.)
Even if they wanted to go beyond
fiscal policy to enliven the economy
and assist business expectations, the
monetary authorities will have to look
at these forces squarely. If I read them
aright, they rule out the possibility of
official moves to reduce interest rates.
In these circumstances the future of
share prices is not too bright unless
fiscal policy tries to force the pace
and business seeks relief from the pres-
sures on its profit margins in prices.
Both these are possibilities, though one
cannot prejudge a new Treasurer be-
fore his first Budget. Nor should we
underrate the present force of competi-
tion in inhibiting price increases, even
if the alternative means dismissing
labor.
In the meantime, industrial equities
look like staying suspended in the
reverse yield gap, awaiting monetary
instability to lift them out. As a general
class, I can see no other possible way
out for them in the near future. Cer-
tainly not through the discounting of
substantially higher dividends, which
might be expected from high real
growth, the real growth rate here
having slowed to a walk. For particular
shares, yes. There will always be some
of these reflecting special growth situa-
tions, just as there will be other shares
reflecting regression of their firms and
industries in the national economic
hierarchy.
J AM excluding from all this the possi-
bility of the Australian investment
arena being enclosed by exchange
controls such as have virtually locked
the N.Z. investor inside his own coun-
try (there were suggestions last week
the N.Z. Reserve Bank was about to
relent a little on the Budget ban on
dealings in overseas shares for N.Z.
currency). That is not the sort of
solution industrial equity investors
here are looking for. Nor are they
looking for the type which has lifted
industrial equities to a postwar peak
in Britain; one means, of course, a
capital-gains tax aided as it is in
present circumstances by inflation and
the emerging possibility pf devaluation,
the friend of shareholders par excel-
lence.
We can for the foreseeable future,
anyway, rule out a “lock in” of the
N.Z. variety and also a capital-gains
tax, such as in the U.K., where equities
are lifted by a scrip shortage. This
brings us back to the possibilities for
monetary instability, or, to put it
crudely, inflation. Nothing is better
calculated to neutralise the adverse
effect of high fixed interest rates on
equity prices. It sets in motion the
familiar sort of scissors movement in
favor of equities. As the purchasing
power of money falls, a given fixed
interest rate becomes less attractive.
Also, the capital sum invested loses
value in purchasing-power terms.
After the prolonged stability Aus-
tralia has experienced in recent years
and the skill gained in monetary and
fiscal management in this period, it
would be idle to presume we are enter-
ing a period of inflation. Nothing was
further from the thoughts of the
Treasury authors of the recent Govern-
ment White Paper on the economy,
whose eyes were focused more on the
possibility of some sectional slackness
(such as in private building and con-
struction) in the economy to be taken
up rather than on the possibility of an
overflow of excess demand or cost-push
causing inflation. They seemed to be
worrying more about how to buck up
the rate of growth and maintain
sufficiency of consumer spending in
the face of a possible slackening in
private investment.
On the Treasury’s showing, investors
in industrial equities will have to wait
a while yet for a clear inflation signal,
though I’m not at all sure the wait will
be all that long. For instance, it could
be that we shouldn’t be counting the
economic chips at home so much as
looking at the new possibilities for de-
valuation of sterling for the answer
to this question. In any case the econ-
omic survey may have been a bit too
complacent on external outlook.
No doubt it has occurred to some-
body in the Treasury that, in the event
of sterling being devalued, so would
be practically the whole of our inter-
national reserves, with a corresponding
loss in the resources available to the
economy. Perhaps this wasn’t some-
thing to put in the survey. At the
present level of reserves it might not
be as big a disaster as at first glance
because we still buy about a quarter of
our imports in Britain, the rise in U.K.
prices would be gradual, and doubtless
some of our other sterling sources of
imports would also devalue. Perhaps
the more important consideration for
us in the context of inflation pos-
sibilities here is that, if we followed
sterling in a devaluation, prices of our
imports in Australian currency terms
would rise and this would be reflected
in higher prices over the whole
economy.

Takeovers in Aluminium?
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
IT looks as if the big aluminium pro-
ducers are preparing for a burst
of takeover activity in the alu-
minium consumer products industry
along the lines of their scramble a
couple of years ago into aluminium
wholesaling.
Already Alcoa is well on the way
into the consumer end of the industry,
with its aluminium house siding and
its links with Dowell and Overseas
Corporation. And now it is stepping
up that interest in a move that seems
certain to stimulate other big semi-
fabricators like Australuco and Com-
alco to follow the vertical integration
pattern right down to the consumer.
There already are some powerful
links, like Comalco’s large share
interest in G. E. Crane and Alcoa’s
association through Cupples Products
with Wunderlich.
But the big expansion plans for new
factories in three States, which Alcoa
and Overseas Corporation have an-
nounced for their jointly owned
Dowell group, draws attention to
prospects for Dowell’s competitors like
Dural Leeds and Hunter Douglas. Un-
doubtedly, Dowell’s three new factories
are going to have some effect on the
sales of one or all of these companies.
Yet it seems on the cards that at
least one of them will end up under
Alcoa’s wing along with Dowell, or
possibly be taken over by a metal
maker, such as Comalco, as a move
to counter Alcoa’s entry into the mar-
keting end.
Dural Leeds seems a likely subject
for such a takeover sooner or later,
although there could be dangers in-
volved in looking at the shares on
this score alone. The aluminium pro-
ducers may well decide against moving
in any greater degree into end pro-
ducts if local demand for metal con-
tinues to rise at the fast pace of recent
times, particularly as some vertical
moves in the U.S. have not been par-
ticularly successful. Nevertheless, it has
been a clear pattern overseas and it
is now beginning to happen here.
THE big moves in soft drinks, with
General Foods’ talks with Cottees
now taking the limelight from
the Coca Cola news of non-returnable
bottles, have drawn attention to the fact
that the market image for Tarax is
showing marked recovery from its low
1963 point. At $l.lO the shares are
yielding 5|- percent from the higher
12 percent dividend which directors
indicated for 1965-66 in the interim
report.
Profits were considerably higher in
the December six months and Mel-
bourne’s long dry summer will have
ensured a record result for the group
over the full year to June 30. The
group’s new products canned drinks,
cordial preparations, and low-calorie
drinks have all become well estab-
lished and broadened the base of opera-
tions.
But the real feature of the shares at
present is the capital growth possibilities
they offer. Directors are currently plan-
ning substantial capital expenditure on
new products, additional buildings, and
general expansion. The company his-
tory indicates that part of this will be
financed by an issue to shareholders.
Tarax has already learned about the
risks of over-expansion the hard way, so
there seems little danger that the
coming moves will be so large as to
cripple earning rates as the 1961-62
one-for-one issue did.
FRIGRITE’S $1 shares appear worth
considering at current prices of 52
cents. This is only two cents above
their lowest price this year. The group
earned 8.8 percent on capital in 1964-65
and should have scored a substantial
improvement on this for the latest year.
In the December six months profits-
were more than double the earnings of
the previous corresponding period, but
no dividend announcement accompanied
the interim report. Nevertheless, there
seem to be reasonable prospects for. a
final dividend this year. An added
attraction is the $l.OB asset backing for
each of the $1 units.
The sharp moves in the price of the
shares earlier this year indicate that a
speculator could make a quick profit
once prices start to rise. The January
price range was between 60 and 65
cents. In February this improved to
70-72 cents, a level which held until the
March interim report (and no divi-
dend), which pushed the price down to
58 cents. A quick recovery took the
price back to 70 cents in April, and it
has gradually drifted to the present
level on very small turnovers.
The shares are obviously rather prone
to moving sharply under small pressure,
so a return toward par seems likely
when announcement of the year’s result
is due. This will be accelerated if the
result carries a dividend declaration.
A CONSISTENT but unspectacular
record, lack of growth, mediocre
earnings, the recent slack in the
building industry, and very tough com-
petition are combined factors in the
drift of the $1 shares in Patersons, the
Melbourne furnisher, to current price
of 63 cents. Even if the company reports
a poor result for the year, the prospects
are that the dividend would still be
enough to appeal to an income-seeking
investor. The shares are currendy yield-
ing an unlikely 12 percent from the 7|
percent dividend. If the dividend were
cut to, say, 5 percent, the return on
current prices would still be 8 percent.
The group is well established with
regular customers, strong on assets
($1.13 for each share), and business is
conducted on conservative lines. The
main thing affecting profits in recent
times has been the level of costs. Earn-
ing rate was 9.4 percent in 1964-65.
Sales were steady in the December half.
The Chartist says:
STEAMSHIPS TRADING CO. appears to have good recovery prospects on
technical grounds. The overall picture since 1960 suggests a somewhat cyclical
situation and a downward trend followed the top formation of 1964. A
rectangle base pattern has formed above 88c over the past thirteen months, which
suggests a rise to about the $1.50 level eventually. Sales have now taken place up
to' $l.OB, and this would be considered a breakout from the congestion area. A
shorter-term projection of about $1.35 is indicated, where fairly strong resistance
would be encountered.

Stronger Floor
For Tin
THE International Tin Council’s
new buffer stock price range adds
to the strength of the £stg.l2oo a
ton “floor” on the London Metal Ex-
change—although the basic floor in the
ITC’s scheme is now £llOO. But there
are three “zones” in the price range—
the buffer manager may buy at prices
between £llOO and £l2OO, can neither
buy nor sell between £l2OO and £l3OO,
and may sell between £l3OO and £l4OO.
The £l2OO level thus becomes the
psychologically important lower level.
And, probably not accidentally, the level
chosen is the same as that at which the
U.S. stockpile controller cut sales last
year.
The added confidence among pro-
ducers, which a definite minimum price
will provide, will be quite important in
building up output. The gap between
production and consumption is large,
and is currently being filled by U.S.
sales from surplus stocks. There are
about 75,000 tons left for sale, which
at the current rate would suffice for
about five years.
Good progress toward filling the gap
was made last year, when the shortfall
was about 15,000 tons, compared with
20,000 tons in 1964. But tin prices aver-
aged over £stg.l4oo last year. This
prompted the establishment of many
small high-cost mines.
Suqar Pricing
COLONIAL Sugar Refining Co. Ltd.
points out in its latest annual report
that, currently, world sugar stocks
total 33 percent of 1965-66 consump-
tion, which would “not be regarded as
excessive for most food commodities.”
Directors point out that, at the end of
1960-61, stocks totalled 32.4 percent of
that year’s consumption, but that within
two years a London price of £stg.los
a ton was reached.
The events which brought prices up
so steeply, however, were far more than
the ordinary run of rain or drought.
The breakdown of the International
Sugar Agreement and the failure of
Cuba’s crop combined to cut supplies
and disorganise markets.
Conditions are different now, with
the boom-inspired expansion programs
providing much more assurance of ade-
quate supplies.
Producers have almost stopped their
expansion programs. Last season was
not by any means a specially lucky one.
Consumption on the other hand is
not booming, with perhaps a 2 million-
ton lift a year currently—about 4 per-
cent of 1965-66’s 60 million tons total,
which virtually balanced production.
So, considering the high production
costs in many less-developed nations, it
is inevitable that prices will improve:
but when and by how much are ques-
tions both large and at present un-
answerable.

MINING
Assessing Metals Profits
BY the end of this month most of
the full year’s production figures
for mining companies with
June 30 balance dates will be available
for keen investors to assess the likely
profits before the final figures start
flooding in within the next few weeks.
To gain a more accurate assessment,
production figures should be studied in
conjunction with trends in metal
prices, always bearing in mind the
existence of any contracts at fixed prices
or any other pricing system applying
to the particular company’s output.
Another very important factor will be
any likely changes in the costs of pro-
duction, exploration, or expansion in-
curred during the year.
If, for example, we compare the
average London Metal Exchange cash
prices of the four leading non-ferrous
metals, copper, lead, zinc, and tin, in
the years to June 30, 1965 and 1966,
copper is the clear winner, showing a
gain from £stg.437 to £568 per ton.
Tin also shows a gain from £1382 to
£1407, while the average LME lead
and zinc prices have fallen, lead from
£122 to £lO4 and zinc from £l2l to
£lO6 per ton.
However, because of the existence
of producers’ price agreements for
copper and zinc, these prices are not
necessarily an accurate indication of
the actual prices realised by particular
companies over these periods. LME
prices are a reasonably accurate guide
to the earnings of Australian lead pro-
ducers. The Australian tin price reflects
movements in the Penang price, which
follows trends in the LME price
although it has generally been at a
slightly lower level.
PRODUCERS’ price agreements have
been made in the past for copper
and zinc because of concern over the
widely fluctuating prices which are
detrimental to sales and encourage sub-
stitution. Generally, these fixed prices
are below the free market prices, but
could be a means of supporting the
price should there be any marked
weakening in world prices.
In fact, this has been the case with
zinc recently, as LME average monthly
zinc prices have been running at levels
slightly under the current producer
price of £stg.lo2 per ton ($A255)
since last April. The zinc producers’
price was first fixed in July, 1964, at
£125 ($312), under the leadership of
the Imperial Smelting Corporation,
Australian producers following suit.
Now only 20-30 percent of world pro-
duction of zinc is sold on the LME.
In September, 1964, the zinc pro-
ducers’ price was reduced to £stg. 110
($A275) and {was further reduced to
£lO2 ($255) last March. As a rough
guide to the gross prices realised by
Australian producers selling at these
levels (transport costs being a factor of
obvious importance for any Australian
exports) it is estimated that in the
financial year to June 30, 1966, the
average will be around £lOB ($270)
per ton compared with about £ll3
($282) in 1964/65.
In the case of copper, Australian pro-
ducers first fixed the domestic price at
$640 per ton in April, 1964 (at this
stage it was supplemented under the
Copper Bounty Act, which guarantees
a minimum price of $6BO per ton).
Following world trends it was increased
to $6BO in August, 1964, to $750 in
May, 1965, to $790 in October, 1965,
and to its present level of $B7O per ton
in early January this year. Thus the
average of roughly $6BO-$690 per ton
in the 1964/65 financial year has been
increased to around $B2O in 1965/66.
By contrast, world producers in Chile,
Zambia, and the Congo abandoned their
producer prices last April. For instance,
the Zambian price, which was previously
fixed at £stg.336 per ton, now follows


“I thought
they were all
good shares!”
So they were ... good solid shares ... when you bought them

the LME three months’ forward price.
The Zambian price, which would have
averaged somewhat over £stg.26o (over
$650) in 1964/65, increased to roughly
£stg.3l2 ($780) in the first nine months
of 1965/66, but because of the higher
LME prices will average out closer to
£360 ($890) for the full year.
This is of particular significance to
Mount Morgan Ltd., which has an
export contract with the Sumitomo
Trading Company, of Japan, based on
the Zambian price. Last year the
average price realised per ton of copper
by Mount Morgan was just over $6BO,
but this year, on the above estimates, it
could be some $lOO per ton higher.
Thus, although the water shortages
due to the drought curtailed production
between July and December, 1965,
resulting in a decline in blister copper
production from 6526 tons in 1964/65
to 4819 tons in 1965/66, the higher
prices will offset this to a large degree.
Total revenue from copper sales (before
costs) in 1964/65 was in excess of $4.4
million and this year should be around
$4.3 million. In addition, the higher
gold production in 1965/66 (82,610 fine
oz. produced at the smelter—an in-
crease of 23100 z.) will add over
$70,000 to gold earnings. So despite the
undisclosed loss incurred in the first
half of the year it seems likely that
the chairman’s forecast last February
that the full year’s profit would be
“comparable” with last year’s will be
substantiated.
JJOUNT Isa Mines Ltd on the other
hand, has produced 75,870 tons of
blister copper, substantially in excess
of last year’s strike-affected figure of
35,200 tons and greater also than the
pre-strike level of 70,895 tons in 1963/
64. Mount Isa Mines, which earns ap-
proximately 70 percent of its earnings
from its copper production, has not ex-
ported any copper this year, all produc-
tion being sold at the domestic pro-
ducers’ price, which, as estimated above,
could average around $B2O per ton in
the year to June 30, 1966. On this
basis copper sales alone should amount
to over $62 million, compared with
total metal sales last year of $46 mil-
lion when average metal prices realised
were $662 per ton of copper, $304 per
ton of lead, and $292 per ton of zinc.
Despite reduced prices this year for
lead and zinc, this year’s profit pros-
pects look very good.
It must be remembered, though, that
the company has to bear the costs of
the current expansion program, includ-
ing the new K 57 shaft and No. 2 con-
centrator, designed to lift total ore
output to a daily rate of 16,000 tons.
(Currently it is at levels of almost
11,000 tons.) Also the cost of bringing
the company’s McArthur River (N.T.)
extensive silver-lead-zinc deposit into
full-scale production has been initially
estimated at in excess of $lOO million.
However, a decision on the commercial
prospects of this deposit is not ex-
pected for at least a year.


Highlights of Speech by
Mr. GEORGE S. MOORE
PRESIDENT
FIRST NATIONAL CITY BANK
(NEW YORK)
on June 30, 1966, announcing the purchase of 50 per cent
of the Share Capital of Waltons Credit Corporation Limited
# First National City Bank (Citibank) is more than
150 years old. Its Capital Funds exceed l]4 billion
U.S. dollars ($1,250,000,000), larger than any other
bank in the world.
# Two principals have been paramount in the his-
tory of the bank—one is strength. This explains
our Capital position and our record of paying
a dividend to shareholders every year since our
founding in 1812. The other is adaptation to change.
We have long had a reputation for leading many
constructive changes in banking services.
# Assets of the Bank exceed 14 billion U.S. dollars
($14,000,000,000).
# As I look around the world, I see few countries
that offer opportunities surpassing those visible
here. Australia faces a future of exciting achieve-
ment.
# Your laws and practices do permit us to enter the
finance business here. We have had considerable
experience and success in this field also, in such
lending activities as the instalment financing of
automobiles, consumer durables and equipment;
in financing real estate mortgages; in personal loan
business; as well as in factoring accounts receiv-
able and leasing equipment.
# I assure you we are impressed, not only with the
present soundness of the assets and the profitability
of Waltons Credit Corporation, but with the oppor-
tunity it offers for expansion and broader service
to your people and business community.
# Waltons Credit Corporation Limited, formed in
1958, has financed the major part of the instal-
ment accounts receivable of Waltons Limited.
Between July 31, 1959, and July 31, 1965, these
accounts receivable have expanded almost five
times to where they now equal nearly SASS million.
This is an impressive performance.
# Whilst the first aim of the new credit company
will be to continue this excellent business, we pro-
pose to serve the Australian financial market with
the broad spectrum of financial services I have
mentioned.
# We plan, in due course, to offer additional fixed
interest debentures for public subscription. The
name of the joint enterprise will be changed, sub-
ject to official approval to Citibank-Waltons
Credit Corporation Limited, with Mr. John R.
Walton as Chairman.
# We of Citibank are honoured to be partners with
Waltons Limited in this credit corporation. We
are joining with people whom we admire and
respect. The linking of our resources and capa-
bilities should ensure a successful future for the
new company. I believe this is an excellent ex-
ample of the manner in which the people of our
two countries can work more closely together to
our common benefit.
Statement by
Mr. JOHN R. WALTON
CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR
WALTONS LIMITED
We at Waltons are naturally very happy to be associated with the powerful and highly respected name of the
First National City Bank of New York. We are greatly honoured to have with us today, Mr. George S. Moore, who
has flown out especially to make the announcement of this event —an indication of the importance that the Bank
attaches to this partnership, which of course, is of even greater significance to Waltons.
It was three months ago tomorrow that Mr. Moore and I shook hands on this deal in New York. It is worth men-
tioning in this connection that our good friends Sears, Roebuck and Co. played an important part in bringing the
Bank and Waltons together. Incidentally, today I received a message from General Wood, the grand old man of
Sears whom some of you met in Australia in February, which states —
"Congratulations and best wishes to you and George Moore for the alliance of Waltons and First National City
Bank. R. E. Wood.”
For the help and good wishes of General Wood and Sears, Roebuck and Co., we are very grateful.
Over the last three months there has been much to be done. The lawyers have worked hard and long in preparing
those documents that form the basis of our partnership. The Federal Reserve Board of the United States and our
own Reserve Bank have closely considered the arrangements before granting their respective approvals. But per-
haps most important has been the work done in Australia by the investigating accountants, a distinguished international
firm as well as by a Comptroller of the First National City Bank, in establishing, to their complete satisfaction, the
soundness of the receivables and of the Waltons organisation generally. Without favourable reports in this regard we
would not be gathered here today.
I believe that our alliance with this vigorous organisation, enormous by any comparison, is not only a wonderful event
for Waltons, it is a wonderful thing for Australia. I am sure that our joint company will have a long, happy -and
very successful life.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
CSR's "Other" Problems
ON the face of it, the latest balance
sheet from Colonial Sugar Refin-
ing Co. seems to disagree with
its directors’ view of what happened
to the company in the year to March
31. They said that “poor financial re-
sults from the mills and the interest
cost of increased borrowings were offset
by a material improvement in total pro-
fits from other activities and interests
and by a reduction in the provision for
income tax.”
On the contrary, the accounts sug-
gest that most of CSR’s other activities
did as badly as sugar.
What were these non-sugar “mate-
rial improvements”? They were not in
chemicals, where profit was “about the
same”; not in distilleries, where sales
fell from the previous year’s fortu-
itously high level; not in ocean vessels,
whose cargoes fell; not in hardboard,
whose market is levelling off; not in
the Bradford Insulation group, where
“severe competition” has depressed
selling prices, and not in blue asbestos,
where a further loss occurred. Gypsum
and tiles seem the only bright sub-
sidiaries operations.
So the only areas of real improve-
ment appear to be in the partly owned
operations like RMC and Pyneboard;
dividends from these two companies
explained much of the doubling of in-
come from “other” investments to $2.1
million in 1965-66. And the immediate
omens may be bad even for them. The
directors note that in recent months
there has been a slackening in building
activity that has reduced total sales,
although some products continue to do
well.
The parent company investment in
subsidiaries is shown as being currently
valued at $46 million, a rise of $3 mil-
lion over the year. But this investment
earned profits of only $3.2 million last
year, or an average of about 6.9 per-
cent compared with the 16 percent the
parent company itself earned on its
capital before adding its dividends
from subsidiaries.
is no doubt about the impor-
tance of tax benefits to the CSR
accounts; pre-tax profit over the past
three years has fallen by about $5.6
million, while net profit has eased
back less than $2 million.
New investments in plant and min-
ing were stated by directors as im-
portant contributors to the reduction
in taxation provision. Last year the
group spent $23.1 million on plant and
properties and it put up $2.4 million
toward a partnership and joint venture
an item which “includes” an equal
interest in the Mt. Newman project.
B UT how long can CSR continue to
spend so much money on tax-
deductible expansion? Sooner or later
its activities will have to earn their way
without the benefit of tax assistance,
which last year lowered the tax rate
to about 30 percent of the pre-tax
figure instead of the normal 42 j per-
cent. The iron ore developments may
provide it with further opportunities,
and, even though its sugar expansion
seems to have all but ended, the group
still has $9 million of contracts for
capital expendture on its books to
help out with the 1966-67 tax bill.
The style of the accounts has cer-
tainly improved this year, with share-
holders being given the details of the
year’s results in plenty of time to study
them before the annual meeting. But
there continue to be the unexplained
additions to (and subtractions from)
the company’s list of subsidiaries.
The sugar position has been widely
canvassed; directors expect the com-
pany’s production to be up by about
75,000 tons to 807,000 tons, which
would mean an extra $3 million worth
at current prices. But with the Euro-
pean beet crop likely to be good, earlier
hopes for an improvement in prices
late in 1966 may be dimming. The
company’s forecast of a lower group
profit this year seems a realistic one.

Fortunes from Iron Ore
S. Hilditch
OLD plans
changed and
new factors
introduced to the
Western Australian
min erals picture
have affected drasti-
cally the fortunes of
W.A.’s five so-called
“iron millionaires.”
For Lang Han-
cock and his part-
ner, Peter Wright,
an already vast in-
come stands to rise
substantially with
Daniel K. Ludwig’s
entry into the iron
ore and manganese
fields; Garrick
Agnew’s iron royal-
ties from Robe
River will be post-
poned by a Port
Hedland rationalisa-
tion plan; but more
dramatically the
Port Hedland plan turns Mt. Whale-
back into a Pandora’s Box for the most
publicity-shy of the reticent quintet,
Stan Hilditch and Charles Warman.
At last count their share has risen
from $BOO,OOO to more than S2J million
each. Now, if all existing Japanese
contracts are converged on the Mt.
Whaleback area, this could rise another
$1 million apiece. And this covers only
about one-third of the proven deposits
of the area.
It would be hard to find a more
varied group of people than these five.
Stan Hilditch, for all his potential
wealth, prefers to stay in the iron
country, where he works as camp man-
ager for the Mt. Newman group,
which he helped so significantly to
create. Now a greying, lean man of
sixtyish, he went into an unusual part-
nership with Charles Warman, a W.A.
goldfields man who has been called an
engineering genius. Mr. Warman put
up much of the capital for his partner’s
explorations, which began around Mt.
Whaleback in 1956. Later the partner-
ship was granted temporary reserves
over 1349 square miles of the area
which Mr. Hilditch had camped on
for months and had staked out meticu-
lously. In April, 1963, Amax took an
exclusive option over their whole
reserve, later bringing in CSR’s Aus-
tralian equity in what has proved one
of the most harrowing acts of patriot-
ism in the north.
Garrick Agnew’s entry as a force in
this field began indirectly when he be-
gan breaking records as a distance
swimmer in Perth. He held an Empire
Games record at the time he accepted
a scholarship with Ohio State, one of
the top academic colleges in the U.S.
From here he graduated with first-class
honors and went on to Harvard Business
School, where he learnt among other
things to think in the big-scale terms
that have only now become common-
place in his home State. He worked
for a time in the South-West Pacific
area before returning home.
He started out in shipping and, while
he retains fluctuating interests in this
field, his success has spread across four
others: salt, gypsum, bentonite, and
iron.
With a U.S. group, Howe Sound, Mr.
Agnew’s company was 49.9 percent par-
ticipant in Basic Materials, which
proved the Robe River deposits, extend-
ing over 64 miles between Goethite
Gorge and Pannawonica (BHP have an
adjacent lease which they will shelve if
the Port Hedland negotiations are ap-
proved). Mr. Agnew took the survey to
Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co., of Ohio, and
earnt a percent shareholding in a
group that will eventually give a new
meaning to the initials CWA Cliffs
of Western Australia. Cleveland Cliffs
retained 51 percent and brought in
Mitsui, with 35 percent; the other 6|
percent is attributed to “other inter-
ests,” not because they wish to remain
anonymous, but because they have not
yet been brought in.
Mr. Agnew, then, is unconcerned with
the proposed changes. “We always con-
sidered the percent interest in the
operating company the main part of
the arrangement,” he says, “and I’m
sure Robe River will be worked one
day. It’s simply a matter of time.” At
35, he can afford to bide his time.
MR- AGNEW, in a sense, has been
Johnny-on-the-spot, but not nearly to
the same extent as Lang Hancock, who
grew up literally on top of the minerals
that are creating the new boom. His
family had a station on the fringe of
the Hamersley Ranges, and Mr. Han-
cock now owns Mulga Downs, a
750,000-acre sheep station in the For-
tescue Valley, and Hamersley Station, a
500,000 cattle station in the ranges
themselves. As a young man, out on a •
dingo-trapping expedition from his
home, he came across the blue-asbestos
deposits, later to be sold to CSR, at
Wittenoom Gorge and by the time of
his now-famous flight, during the Wet
of 1952, he was an extremely rich man
by Australian standards. Heading south
for the summer, with his wife, in their
small aircraft, he was forced below
clouds and was flying between the walls
of a gorge: he recognised deposits of
iron and returned in the winter of 1953
to trace these for 70 miles. Then he
went touting his finds among 30 of the
world’s biggest companies.
Although Australia, believing itself
short of iron, had banned exports, he
received a contract on December 1,
1959, from Rio Tinto in anticipation,
and rightly, of this soon being lifted.
Geologists of the company later to
become Conzinc Riotinto of Australia
(partners with Kaiser Steel in Hamers-
ley Iron) then broke the code written
in the eroded gorges of this fascinating
country, to lead to Mount Tom Price,
now centre of Hamersley Iron develop-
ment.
Mr. Hancock is nearly 57, his partner
a year older; they have been associated
in the minerals business 25 years. Mr.
Wright, probably the least-known of the
five, is an accountant, at present in
Britain after having visited U.S. indus-
trialists “on projects that might lead to
something later.” Mr. Hancock says
with a touch of intended mystery. They
are partners in all the iron ore ventures
and some of the others; the first iron
shipments get away in August and Mr.
Hancock hopes to get his first royalty
cheques in the current financial year.
He shies away from being specific about
anything to do with his income, though
he has not denied reports that, even
before manganese, he would be getting
$4BOO a day in royalties and would
become Australia’s biggest taxpayer.
A zealous opponent of socialism, he
is far more concerned at the hazards of
Government interference and anxious to
stress that “the significance of the Lud-
wig participation hasn’t yet been seen.
It’s the most far-reaching proposal in
this State so far. It will result in work-
ing low-grade material economically,
with a secondary industry competing
not with the other iron mining con-
cerns but with the scrap-iron people.”
When he gets around to discussing
the millions involved, Mr. Hancock
acknowledges that “some people seem
to treat us as parasites. But without
prospectors there would be no industry
in the north. In Wittenoom 1100 people
lived off me for 20 years.” Certainly
the facts to back his claim are impres-
sive: export of blue asbestos brings in
$4 million a year in foreign exchange.
But the West is not the only place
for iron ore millionaires. Developments
in Tasmania and the Northern Terri-
tory will also bring in millions of dol-
lars to their promoters.
The Frances Creek Iron Mining
Corporation project in the Northern
Territory, which has $22 million worth
of export contracts beginning in six
months or so, is 65 percent owned by
Duval Holdings Ltd., whose principal,
Frank Duval, bought into the leases dis-
covered by Northern Territory prospec-
tors Louis Harmanis and Ken Waters.
With the project estimated to cost $6.6
million to develop, the two major part-
ners, Duval arid the 25 percent holder,
McDonald Industries Ltd., stand to do
very well out of it.
In Tasmania, iron ore means E. R.
Hudson, manager director of Kathleen
Investments Ltd., who on his own
account has a stake in the Savage River
project that will net him about $lO mil-
lion in royalties over the 20 years of a
45 million ton, $5OO million contract
due to start next year. His partners in
this current development are the U.S.
Pickands Mather company and the
Japanese Mitsubishi empire, but these
operations cover only about one-third
of the deposits over which he holds
leases, and the remaining two-thirds
he hopes will one day provide the basis
for a Tasmanian steel industry.


THE MINERAL
THE MILLIONAIRES
Garrick Agnew: Swimmer-turned-
businessman, will get 7½ percent
of Robe River profits.
One of Frank Duval's com-
panies owns 65 percent of the
Frances Creek project near
Darwin.
Lang Hancock: Discovered the
Hamersley deposits
Roy Hudson: Will earn $10. mil-

PEGASUS-
a major breakthrough in aero power
Vertical take-off and forward flight from the same engine
Powers the world’s first operational V/STOL strike aircraft
Powers the world’s first jet V/STOL transport
VERTICAL take-off isn’t new. Helicopters
have been doing it for years.
But vertical take-off combined with near
supersonic speed from a single
engine is an achievement a
Bristol Siddeley achievement.
Pegasus is the engine, a vectored^thrust
turbofan that makes the Hawker Siddeley
P 1127 V/STOL strike aircraft so manoeuvr-
able it can dance on air.
The tactical possibilities are enormous. An
aircraft equipped with Pegasus
is immediately endowed
with flexibility, mobility and
surprise—three indispensable elements in
combat.
Applications of the Pegasus are not con-
fined to single-engined aircraft. Two Pegasus
engines, partnered by pure lift engines, also
power the Dornier DO 31, the world’s first
jet V/STOL transport.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Appliance Industry Uncertain
Investment choice narrowed to three
THE six companies in this group
show considerable variations in
price at the time of writing and
it is not possible to see any similarities
in either dividend or earnings yields.
Because General Industries’ and Mal-
leys’ shares still have a par value of
$2.00 and the others have par values
of 50 cents, I have adjusted all prices
to a basis of $l.OO of capital:

(a) based on my estimates of adjusted earnings for
1965/66.
Those who might believe that there
should be some relationship between
the share price and the net worth per
share according to the last published
balance sheet will also search for this
relationship in vain. Only Kelvinator’s
shares are selling above net worth and
the surprising thing is that the share
price only shows a premium of 12 per-
cent on net worth despite the com-
pany’s excellent past profit record. The
other five companies’ share prices
range from 70 percent of net worth
down to 30 percent of net worth.
From these figures, one can only
come to the conclusion that the share
market is quite uncertain about the
future prospects of these companies. In
other words, they are all regarded as
“speculative.”
There are probably some reasons for
this judgment. One, perhaps the major
one, is the lack of knowledge about the
extent to which the companies have
yet to suffer from the bad debts of
the retailing side of the industry. Kel-
vinator has been frank about its likely
losses from the H. G. Palmer debacle,
as have the directors of Simpson Pope.
However, once these losses have been
provided for, one would have thought
that investors would have been pre-
pared to regard past levels of profit as
a reasonable guide to the future. It
must be assumed that they do not have
this confidence, and memories of the
losses of 1961/62 and subsequently are
still fresh in their minds.
While the incidence of major losses
has varied from company to company,
it does seem that all have been affected
to some degree by all the retail failures
which have occurred in the ’sixties. One
finds it difficult to believe that a closer
investigation of some of the customers,
coupled with a closer watch on the
payment of accounts, would not have
shown up some warning signs that
would have enabled the manufacturers
to avoid losses.
Despite the doubts expressed by the
chairman of Kelvinator regarding the
demand for refrigerators over the next
five years, there is good reason to
believe that the level of new family
formations will tend to increase at an
average annual compound rate of about
five percent. As this is likely to pro-
duce a similar rate of growth in hous-
ing demand, one can see the demand
for stoves, refrigerators, and washing-
machines increasing at about the same
rate.
UNFORTUNATELY, this is only a
superficial view. No doubt
tion point for stoves and refrigerators
was reached some time ago, but it is
fairly clear that it is not yet reached in
the case of washing-machines, although
it may now be getting close to it. The
other problem is to know the propor-
tion of these appliances that is pro-
duced for the “new” market and the
proportion which is produced for the
“replacement” market.
It was suggested recently that the
life of a refrigerator was probably
between fifteen and seventeen years;
this does not mean that replacement
does not occur until the end of seven-
teen years. Stoves would probably have
an even longer life, and washing-
machines probably much shorter.
Finally, there is the factor of com-
petition. It seems that this has been
very keen for some time and any
attempts made to rationalise the indus-
try have had little success. In fact,
despite the disappearance over the
years of companies such as Presi-
dent, Colda (taken over by Mal-
leys), and Rota-Frig (taken over by
General Industries), other quite major
manufacturers have appeared on the
scene. Frigidaire would seem to be the
most substantial; so far as can be judged
from the published results it has not
been doing very well, either. J. N. Kirby
is hardly a newcomer, although it has
changed its allegiance from Crosley to
General Electric. AEl’s record even
before the ’sixties was not very inspir-
ing. Standard Telephone withdrew from
the domestic appliance market some
years ago and are probably congratu-
lating themselves now.
So far as our six listed companies
are concerned, only four have a record
of unbroken positive earnings for the
past five years. General Industries made
a loss in 1961, and Simpson Pope made
losses prior to 1963/64. The earnings
record of these four in terms of earning
rates is as follows:
1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Emai'l 9 4 11.1 11 0 10.6 5 6
A. G. Healing 17 6 13.9 15 9 15.9 16.2
Kelvinator 23.1 29.8 31 0 34 7 38.1
Malleys 4 2 10 0 10.0 16.6 18.7
It is noticeable that, if we take the
past four years (and in this event we
can also include General Industries in
the series), the companies, with the
exception of Email, have rising earning
rates.

Kelvinator 100 104 116 128 8 6
Malleys 100 100 167 187 7.0
With all the uncertainty that sur-
rounds the industry, it would seem that
the last three are fairly attractive buy-
ing at the present time on the basis of
their current earnings, interim reports,
and records over the past four years.
Unfortunately, other factors can
always be found to deter the investor.
General Industries’ record has been
rather erratic, and there is always a
feeling that there might be another
sharp reversal of the profit trend. Kel-
vinator has a low dividend yield, and
the shareholders have had only one
benefit in the past fifteen years, so,
despite the earnings, investors could
well feel that they may have too long
to wait for the next handout. In the
case of Malleys, they probably feel
that the Whirlpool campaign has not yet
been running long enough to judge
whether it \yjll capture a real slice of
the market and they are worried by
the substantial June 30 stock build-up.
Apart from those who want to specu-
late, I think the investment choice is
narrowed to these three (General Indus-
tries, Kelvinator, and Malleys). Having
in mind that growth may well he slow
in the industry, I would he inclined to
select the highest dividend yield.
Malleys is the obvious choice because,
although the dividend has been reduced
in the past, there is an unbroken record
since 1941 of dividend payments.
General Industries passed its dividend
in 1962.


THE CHARTIST SAYS
No Signs of Upswing
INVESTORS looking for capital growth since 1960 would
certainly have not found it in the appliance group of
stocks. With the exception of Kelvinator and Malleys,
they appear to be in recessive phases.
Although it is hard to imagine some of them falling to
much lower levels in the short term, they should not be
bought at present on technical grounds. Indeed, strong major
downtrends are evident and it could take some years of
consolidation before any upward movement could be resumed.
Possibly General Industries will make an earlier recovery
from present indications.
EMAIL is certainly a long way from its high point of $1.46
in 1960. A sideways movement above the support level at
70c was followed until penetration early in 1965 and a low
point of 37c was achieved only several weeks ago. Although
no immediate further downside objectives exist, there would
be no reason to buy Email until there is some evidence of a
reversal of trend.
GENERAL INDUSTRIES is another stock where a strong
downtrend has been evident since 1960. Since the low
point of 78c in 1962, the stock has moved in wide fluctua-
tions and there is some technical evidence now that the worst
could be over for General Industries, as a base has formed
which could support a rise to over the $2.50 level eventually.
However, a strong resistance level at $1.45 would need to be
broken on high volume before any major recovery could be
expected.
A. G. HEALING. —The chart must be a depressing sight
to investors who bought into this company near the top level
of $1.60 in 1960 and indeed to any long-term investor who
entered this stock during the past six years. Although a side-
ways movement continued during 1961 to 1963, the down-
trend took a steeper angle toward the end of 1964 and an
all-time low of 19c was recorded in March of this year. The
stock could be regarded as in a strong recessive phase, and it
could have many years of wide fluctuations before there
would be a technical reason to buy after the formation of a
base reversal pattern.
KELVINATOR shows a slightly better performance, as it
managed to hold a 35 percent uptrend for two years until
the break at the beginning of the 1965 bear phase, where a
fall to $1.78 followed. There is still a possibility of a further
decline to the $1.60 level and an extreme downside objective
would be about $1.40. This stock is still in a downtrend, and
investors would take a risk on buying before a clear base
pattern is established.
MALLEYS has shown more cyclical tendencies, and it can
be seen from the chart that this stock consolidated for over
eighteen months after the 1961-62 downtrend. An uptrend
of almost equal duration followed at a rate of 45 percent to
a high point of $3.95 in 1964. After the break of trend early
in 1965, a low point of $2.52 was recorded and this could well
be the low point. However, it should be noted that this stock
is still in a downtrend and should not be purchased until
this is decisively broken.
SIMPSON POPE presents a very similar picture to A. G.
Healing and must be as equally depressing to long-term
investors. Although a base formed after the 1960 decline, the
stock was only able to achieve a high of 74c in the 1963-64
uptrend. A decline followed the break in trend to a low
point of 27c recorded earlier this year. Once again there is
no base consolidation to suggest an early reversal of trend
and there would be a good deal of resistance at the 40c level,
which would slow any eventual recovery. In this type of
recessive situation, a period of several years’ sideways move-
ment can generally be expected before any break in the
major downtrend.

MAN ON THE LAND
Some Lively Days for Wool
THE old Melbourne Wool Exchange
is an appropriate venue for this
week’s meeting of the Australian
Wool Industry Conference (July 21-22).
Many a clerk has lost his way in the
tortuous corridors and stairways of the
Exchange (built around 1890), and our
guess is that some of the delegates to
this conference will have difficulty find-
ing their way, too.
It is no longer possible to talk of a
clear division in the wool industry—
Yes (for orderly marketing) on one
hand and No (against any form of con-
trol) on the other. There are many
divisions now and it could be that this
meeting of the AWIC will be a turning
point. Either the divisions are resolved
or the conference becomes fragmented.
Promotion of wool, or rather the
money necessary to support promotion,
is the cause of grave dissent among
woolgrowers at the moment. The execu-
tive of the AWIC has already recom-
mended to the Federal Government that
the 1966-67 levy for promotion and
research should be maintained at two
percent of gross income from shorn
wool. The chairman, Dr. Melville (who
announced some time ago that he in-
tended to retire), said: “Considering
the continuation of drought conditions
in important woolgrowing areas the
executive felt that the maximum levy
of two percent would be needed to
raise the required $14.5 million wool-
growers’ contribution.”
But, considering the same drought
/ j \ f .
(and some other things), some of the
delegates to the conference are liable to
object strongly to the executive s action
Objectors to the levy come from both
the Yes and the No camp, but,
strangely, the strongest objectors are
some of the men who voted for the
reserve price plan. On the other hand,
there is quite strong support for the
levy from anti-reserve price men who
objected to bureaucracy in marketing,

ut that 1S a b° ut ad be can do, and
™ an 7 growers will reject his explana-
tion. Any talk of growers repudiating
promotion would be at variance with
the facts. Yet already this ugly word
has been used in one or two places
and it will be used again probably.
Sir William Gunn and International
Wool Secretariat managing director
Mr. W. J. Vines repeatedly talk of a
five-year promotion plan. Yet again
it can be charged that a five-year
period was never mentioned during the
campaign to secure the higher pro-
motion levy. There was no agreement
between growers and the Board that
the period should be five years.
Luckily for the Board and the IWS,
wool consumption in the United States
has increased in the past two years.
The Board, naturally, will claim that
the credit for this belongs to the IWS
and its promotion campaign. It is one
of those things which could never be
proved satisfactorily one way or an-
other. Yet two factors in the increased
U.S. wool usage would seem, to our
view, to be beyond argument. These
are the Vietnam war and the moderni-
sation, using electronic equipment, of
American mills.
Perhaps all these things are inter-
related. But to accept blandly the view
that the Woolmark symbol has been
the cause of greater U.S. wool usage
seems utterly naive. If it were even
an important contributory factor a
further question would have to be con-
sidered. Which wool supplier is getting
the most benefit Australia, which
provides the great bulk of Woolmark
funds, or South America, which provides
nothing at all? Until proven otherwise
we maintain that South American ex-
ports of wool to the U.S. have increased
more rapidly than Australian exports.
Our guess is that there will be heated
argument over the continuation of the
levy, but that it probably will be ratified
for at least another year. Perhaps a

firm date for revision will be set. We
cannot visualise anything more drastic,
because the objectors, although strong
individually, do not appear to have the
support of their organisations.
Another hot topic is one-bale lots.
Here again we have an extraordinary
paradox. One would suppose that the
men most in favor of some form of
bulk selling of one-bale lots would be
the men who supply most of the one-
bale lots, i.e., the smaller growers. Yet
evidence to date suggests that smaller
growers want no change and that
strongest objection to one-bale lots is
coming from big graziers who tend to
regard one-bale lots, and perhaps the
men who provide most of them, as nuis-
ances.
Any form of bulk selling of one-bale
lots is controlled marketing. Considering
that perhaps 30, or even 40, percent of
growers supply most of their clip in
one-bale lots it is likely that control of
one-bale lots means control of 30 or 40
percent of growers (not wool, however).
Yet it was small growers who were sup-
posed to be the strongest advocates of
reserve price (i.e., controlled) market-
ing.
JN a somewhat abstract way, the best
fireworks could come from the
N.S.W. Graziers’ Association section of
the Australian Woolgrowers and
Graziers’ Council. The N.S.W. graziers’
charge that the AWIC has exceeded its
constitutional authority could be serious.
It depends how strongly the charge is
pressed. It may be a tactic to bring the
executive to heel. If it does build up it
could put the executive in a position
where resignation becomes the only
thing to do.
It may be that this conference will
also see some discussion on the exact
position of Sir William Gunn. He is,
to date, the only chairman the Wool
Board has had. The Wool Board’s
constitution is different from that of the
old Wool Bureau. Now that Sir Wil-
liam has resigned from the Australian
Woolgrowers and Graziers’ Council it
could be argued that he must, of
necessity, be unavailable for reappoint-
ment when his current term as Board
chairman expires. He has not said that
he intends to retire. The constitution,
perhaps, is open to interpretation on
this particular point.
It all adds up to a rather lively
conference.

Living off a Dairy Farm
ACCORDING to an economic
survey conducted by the Univer-
sity of Queensland, a dairy farmer
needs an annual production of about
90001 b. of butter to give the owner
a decent living. The 1960 Dairy In-
dustry Committee of Enquiry sug-
gested a figure equivalent to an actual
butterfat production of a
year. It further recommended that
finance be provided to enable small
dairy farms to amalgamate and expand
to a size which would permit this mini-
mum level of production.
The term “decent living” is used
here to mean a net income equivalent
to the basic wage, plus loadings to
cover the owner’s risk, reward his
managerial skill, and return interest on
his invested capital. Clearly, such an
income does not make much provision
for beer and skittles. The recipient
would have to live quite frugally.
The university’s agricultural econom-
ists, W. O. McCarthy, N. Hodgson and
J. E. Briggs, collected their figures
from farms in the Boonah Shire,
Queensland, for the five-year period
1957-61. During this period the basic
wage in Queensland averaged $1436 a
year, although the actual average adult
earnings in the State were $2104. These
wages contrast with the average net
income of the farmers surveyed. Their
actual income was calculated at the
time to be only $1284. And this figure
does not include interest on capital.
If these Boonah Shire farmers were
to have got the then-current basic wage
of $1436 plus merely five percent inter-
est for their capital, plus lj percent
for managerial skill, plus another La-
percent for risk, their net income
should have averaged $3232. To attain
such an income the typical farm would
have had to gross over $7OOO and pro-
duce nearly 90001 b. of butter.
JN fact, only 12 percent of the far-
mers in the shire reached or ex-
ceeded this level of production. The
overwhelming majority of the farms in
the area, therefore, has what is termed
a low output problem. Farm enlarge-
ment is an obvious means of over-
coming this problem, though some of
the farmers themselves did not recog-
nise that their troubles stemmed from
having a farm that was too small.
Moreover, most of the farms would
have to increase their size consider-
ably. The average farm is presently of
260 acres and would need another 144-
acres and 23 cows to reach the goal of
90001 b. of butter a year.
In round figures, one farm in three
throughout the shire would have to be
sold up and divided between the re-
maining two. The existing rate of
turnover of land in the district is such
that the average farm is adding only
acres a year. Thus, it will take the
typical farm more than a hundred years
to increase to an optimum size!
Despite this slow market in land,
about a third of the farmers said that
they would be willing to sell out and,
neatly enough, the other two-thirds
said that they would be willing to stay
and buy more land at the ruling rate
of $9O an acre. Amalgamation, it would
seem, could proceed in this district in
an amicable manner without the need
of any coercion. All that is wanted,
apparently, is a finance scheme.
It would be very helpful to ascertain
to what extent this predicament applies
in other problem dairy districts in Aus-
tralia. Ireland, Holland, and the United
Kingdom have all managed to devise
schemes to allow farm enlargement to
occur smoothly. These are described in
an OECD publication of 1964 entitled
“Low Income in Agriculture Prob-
lems and Policies.” Industry and Gov-
ernment planners here might care to
take a look at this report.

S PECULATOR’S DIARY
Mr. Bearbull of Britain
Plus the quest for a gold share
A BROKING friend of irnne has spent the past few months overseas trying to
keep up with the inflation that has become so prevalent there. In England,
apparently, the wages and productivity policies implemented by the Labor
Government have got out o<f hand. A nine percent increase in wages in the past
year has been met by an absolutely negative increase in productivity. Hence the
increase in prices in the land of the bowler hat.
Although the English economy is in
a dangerously weak state, the U.K.
share market is riding on the high tide
of inflation. Also artificially boosting the-
share market is the abnormal demand
for shares by the booming unit trust
business in the U.K. Unit trusts seem
to be formed for any purptose, the latest
being one concentrating on companies
which will benefit by tJhe recent gas
discoveries in the North Sea.
One thing my friend noticed was the
following question and zinswer series in
“Your Money,” a feature column in one
of the popular dailies:
Question: I want to invest in Aus-
tralia, where my son is now living, but
need a high yield.
Answer: Millars Timber and Trading
at 17s each yield 7 percent. They are
speculative, but this is, a fine company.
Not, I feel, the most representative
company of our fair land. Also, just
what is a “fine” company?
On a more professional note was, I
gathered, Mr. Bearbull’s column in the
London Stock Exchange Gazette on
June 24. The whohe column was de-
voted to the virtues of one of my old
favorites, Hanimex Corporation. Intro-
ducing the company as one of “excel-
lent potential,” he goes on to give his
reason for the poor price performance
of Hanimex in the past year: first,
“the fact that the import surcharge
proved expensive, and, secondly, that
so far at least the tax charge has been
sub-normal.” One worthwhile point
that Mr. Bearbull produced was that
“total sales of photographic materials
and equipment last year in the U.K.
t^ie mark an increase
£7rn. on previous year—and a 1
the evidence is that demand is still
running at a high level. Since Mr.
Bearbull made his purchase a few weeks
a S° the shares have nsen ten cents -
So much for England, where, if noth-
ing else, the Stock Exchange is still
operating. Not so in Colombo, where
the local exchange has closed down
until further notice! It was these sad
stories that made my thoughts turn to
devaluation or, at least, the fear of it.
And that, naturally, led on to the sub-
ject of gold shares.
Rather than join in the argument
about whether Australia will follow
England in a devaluation, I’m quite
happy to let other people speculate on
this matter in the next few months pro-
vided I’m holding a gold share. One I
did consider was New Guinea Gold,
but, as I mentioned the other week,
this stock has already had a 33 percent
rise this year.
Instead, I settled for the Fijian-based
Emperor Mines. After missing dividends
for several years, a 6d dividend was
paid in 1965. Since then production has
been maintained, so a similar payment
seems likely again this year. This cur-
rent performance alone should be
enough to attract any anxious gold share
bidder.
My only other purchase this week
was another 100 Tennyson to make my
holding up to 500, so that I’ll get an
even 400 in the new company being
formed as a result of the merger with
STP. So far the market has failed to
show any great enthusiasm for this mer-
ger. Why is hard to understand, when
the dividend yield will be over 6 per-
cent, assuming STP’s percent rate
is maintained. This dividend would be
about 2\ times covered by profits if, as
seems likely, STP has maintained its
29 percent earning rate on capital in-
creased by the takeover of Sekers Silk.
The first sale this week was Deposit
and Investment at 28 cents. Bought
at 18 cents only three months ago, I
managed to achieve a 50 percent profit.
In cold cash that represents $9O. Kath-
leen rights produced an ever better
result when they went up to $1.30. At
that price the profit came out at $lB3,
too good to resist on top of the $63
profit on the 400 shares sold last week.
Transactions this week were:
PURCHASES
1000 Emperor Gold 55c $563.
100 Tennyson Textiles 80c $B2.
SALES »
1000 Deposit, Invest. 28c $273.
400 Kathleen rts. $1.30 $598.
This jumps the balance up to $1431,
indeed a healthy balance for this lad.
