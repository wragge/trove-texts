National Notebook
Film History
A piece of film history came our way
last week when Mary Astor, star
of “The Maltese Falcon,” “The Great
Lie” and other vintage Warner Bros
films of the ’forties, as well as countless
TV dramas, arrived for a brief visit on
the Oronsay. Miss Astor told us that
whereas she would spend five or six
weeks on her vintage movies, nowadays
she would do a TV play in the same
number of days.
“You get a script Monday, costumes
Tuesday, and shoot Wednesday,” she
said. “The trouble with TV plays is that
the director is often working for a man
who knows nothing about the medium.
The big boys of Warners knew every-
thing about films and they give a director
a free hand to get results In TV the
sponsors interfere constantly.
“From the actor’s point of view the
advantage over movies is the greater
variety of parts you get. And having to
grasp a role right straight off makes for
greater concentration. But it is difficult
to achieve a rounded character in the
medium.”
She regarded her best screen roles as
Brigid O’Shaughnessy in “The Maltese
Falcon” and the Other
Woman in “Dodsworth”.
Of the first, she said:
“The director, John Hus-
ton, said to me: ‘The
woman you’re playing is
a liar. Liars are always a
little out of breath.’ So he
had me run round the set three times.
When I was through l was ready to play
a liar to perfection !”
Miss Astor is also the author of three
novels, the latest of which, “The
O’Connors,” about a husband-and-
wife TV team, is “very close to home,”
she says. It will appear from Double-
day in March.
Ida Leeson
/"Vne of the more extraordinary figures
of Sydney was Miss Ida Leeson,
who died last week aged 78. She was
extraordinary in many ways. She was
a formidable researcher (she found
Matthew Flinders’ long lost log book
at the Admiralty when she was in Lon-
don in 1927); she was Mitchell
Librarian from 1932 to 1944 and
librarian of the South Pacific Com-
mission and the School of Pacific Ad-
ministration, she was a captain and
then major in Alf Conlon’s redoubtable
Directorate of Research during the war.
In later years she was an extraordin-
ary and endearing figure at a quiet Mac-
quarie Street restaurant, eating her way
fastidiously through a very tiny meal,
straw hat perched primly and squarely
on her grey head. The most extraordin-
ary thing about her, however, was her
capacity to prise secrets from people.
Ida Leeson had no squeamish sensitivity
about secrets —personal or those of state
—for she never had the slightest doubt
that secrets existed only for her to
know them.
One of her senior colleagues once
remarked in loving desperation: “There
is only one way to appease Ida. Tell
her a secret a day!”
Signing Off
A ustralia’s champion autograph-
hunter has turned over his collection
to the Australian War Memorial and the
National Library, Canberra. He is Mr
Stanley Ravenscroft, a retired Sydney
businessman. Mr Ravenscroft’s collection
was not a big one; it amounted to 200
signatures, all on portrait photographs.
However, it made up in calibre for
what it lacked in numbers. Mr Ravens-
croft began it in 1911 when he captured
the signatures of Earl Roberts and
Kitchener, and he continued at about
that level of celebrity
until he decided a few
years ago that Harold
Macmillan was where he
would end. In between
came names like Clemen-
ceau, Foch, Churchill,
Shaw, Pavlova, Sibelius,
Toscanini and Melba; and rubbing along
with them all were the Prime Ministers
of Australia from Barton onwards—a
complete set. “Unique in its variety and
wide field of interest” was the National
Library’s phrase for the collection.
Mr Ravenscroft told us last week that
his hobby was possibly an unusual one
today. Apart from the quiz expert Barry
Jones, who he thought was an enthusiast,
he knew of no one with a collection
like his own. “Some people collect
stamps; I collected these,” he said. “I
used to get quite a kick out of it.” But
he would not tell us what we would
most have liked to know: the names of
the only three celebrities ever to knock
him back for an autograph. “They
weren’t interested,” he recalled “I just
. wouldn't discuss them.” With the dis-
arming pride of a true collector. “It was
their loss,” he said.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Making the Arbitration
Commissioners Think
THhe really important thing about
the employers’ new wages policy
—seeking to have the total wage
fixed instead of having the basic
wage and margins fixed separately—
is that it will, or should, force the
Commonwealth Arbitration Com-
mission to undertake a fundamental
re-examination of the basis of its
wage-fixing policy.
In this area of national policy,
which is removed from political and
governmental control, it is vital that
the Commission should not act in a
routine, habitual, non-critical way but
should keep its methods, its machinery
and its principles under constant and
conscious review.
It is true that the Commission
merely settles disputes and is not an
organ for determining economic
policy, that it cannot control, in any
way, either prices or the level of
profits. But, whatever limits the Com-
mission may place on its activities in
determining wages, it is operating at
the very heart of the economic
complex and there are grounds for
believing that it does not do enough
of the fresh, critical thinking but
tends to tread its worn path according
to customs and procedures settled
long ago when the problem was quite
different.
ThiE employers appear to be deter-
A mined to prod the Commission
into a full-dress re-examination of its
long-standing way of going about
things, by attacking the system at its
central point the division of the
wage into two elements, basic wage
and margins. They have acted in a
constructive and stimulating way.
There may have been a reason for
having a division of this kind when
the basic wage was a real and total
wage paid to a section of the un-
skilled workers. Forty or fifty years
ago it was important to see that such
people, covered by Federal Awards,
received no less than a fixed sum—
the minimum amount required to
meet the needs of a family of a
certain age with an additional
section of the wage—the margin—
also paid to most workers for skill,
responsibility, the onerous or un-
congenial character of the work, and
so on.
But, long ago, this basis for
dividing the wage into two parts
disappeared, and the basic wage,
like the margin, is today not limited
to the minimum needs of a family,
but fixed at the highest level that the
capacity of the economy will sustain.
Both elements of the wage are, of
course, adjusted over periods of time,
by one means or another, to the
changed values of money. In addition
both elements are increased, or
should be increased, to the extent
and only to the extent that the
capacity of the economy permits.
A ll this means that as productivity
increases, so should both elements
in the total wage. But both elements
together should not increase to a
greater extent than the movement in
productivity would warrant.
The real problems in this field are
threefold. Firstly the parties struggle,
on the one side, to get more than
increases in productivity really justify,
and, on the other, to keep increases
below that level or to delay the
awarding of justifiable increases as
long as possible. Secondly there is the
decision about how much of the
available room for movement should
be taken up in basic wage increases
and how much in marginal increases.
Thirdly there are real disputes and
real difficulties about the actual level
of increases which the state of the
economy and the improved pro-
ductivity would permit.
As to this third difficulty, it is not
very easy for anyone (including the
Commission) to measure increases
and to determine the rate of move-
ment in productivity. Indeed the
Commission believes that the task can
only usefully be attempted every three
or four years. This is what the Com-
mission now tries to do with both
elements of the wage. But it does it
at different times.
Tf the task can best be performed
at intervals of about three years it
seems silly to do it every 18 months
or so by dealing with margins in
between the decisions about the basic
wage.
Logically it would seem to be best
to deal with both in the one enquiry
every three years. This at least would
enable, indeed force, a conscious con-
sideration of the relative increases to
be given to margins and basic wage
respectively and it would also open
up the question, which the employers
want determined, whether both
elements should be increased in direct
proportion.
Although this seems logical enough
there are difficulties about having this
overdue type of enquiry every three
years. The tendency for all awards
to follow the Metal Trades Award
would mean that the economy would
suffer the impact of wage increases
occurring all more or less at the one
time. Furthermore, over the pre-
ceding years increases in productivity
may well have been already distri-
buted in over-award payments and in
dividends. Further, in times of full
employment whatever is awarded
tends to be added to over-award
payments not absorbed in them.
All these matters have to be
weighed.
The Commission should regard the
case as a challenge to do a lot of hard
thinking about fundamentals. If it
does, then it may well be that things
will never again be quite the same
in this area of economic policy.


THIS AUSTRALIA
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
The Secrets of Perth
A madman hanged?
FROM A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
B. W. ROBINSON
Huntington's chorea. ..
hanging of Brian William Robin-
•*- son last week in Fremantle Gaol
created no great stir in the Australian
Press, outside Western Australia. With
one exception the Eastern States’ news-
papers reported the hanging with only
a few paragraphs. The ABC had broad-
cast The Ballad of Reading Gaol the
night before the hanging but that was
a coincidence. When it came to the
morning of the hanging only one person
demonstrated outside the gaol, a house-
wife, acting independently.
The reasons for the relative lack of
interest were not hard to find. Robinson
had shot down a policeman who had
attempted to intervene in an argument
between Robinson and his father, then
gunned down a passer-by who tried to
disarm him while he was fleeing and
finally was only arrested after fresh gun-
fire. Even a person who violently
opposed capital punishment on principle
would perhaps have been able to agree
with the “The West Australian” when in
an editorial it said “the case . . . had no
element of doubt and no redeeming
feature.”
Certainly there was no element of
doubt in the case, no suggestion that
Robinson was not the man who had
killed the policeman and the passer-by.
But in Robinson’s birth and family back-
ground, but if these facts were known to
frenzy on that February day last year.
By choice, Robinson had refused to
allow these facts to be used during his
trial. The truth had been approached
several times in court but never brought
out. But the Executive Council which
made the final decision for the hanging
should have been in possession of facts
on Robinson’s birth and background.
The Executive Council would have
had before it a report from the trial
judge and also a report from the Crown
Law Office which should have given
details of Robinson's family background.
What these undisclosed facts do is to
give very strong support to the defence
that Robinson was mentally ill.
The laws of libel and Robinson’s
expressed refusal to allow anything to
be made public that would hurt his
family stop the publication of his back-
ground, but if these facts were known to
the Executive Council any suggestion that
they saw “no redeeming feature” is
difficult to understand.
What has been disclosed by Robin-
son’s lawyer, Mr J. S. Marian, is some-
thing of the history of mental break-
down in Robinson's family. The wife
of his father suffered from Huntington’s
Chorea, described as a rare and one of
the few hereditary mental diseases, before
she died ten years ago in a mental
hospital. Robinson’s elder sister in her
forties has been a regular patient in
institutions and also suffers from the
same disease. In addition Mrs Robin-
son’s mother appears to have suffered
from the same disease. Robinson is
virtually illiterate.
The cause of the argument with his
father on February 9, last year, is said
to have been over a discovery he had
made that day about the circumstances
of his birth. (Records of a children’s
court case about the time of Robinson’s
birth have been lost.)
Even what can be disclosed about his
mental condition makes it clear that
there was at least some ground for
doubt about Robinson’s sanity, to put
it very mildly. At the least the whole
case is yet another argument for an
examination of the outmoded procedures
and legal forms that surround any plea
of insanity.
The hanging of Robinson has made
the Fremantle gaol chaplain, the Rev.
Ernest Grundy of the Anglican Church,
call not only for the abolition of capital
punishment but for complete prison re-
form. He said afterwards: “You have to
have your nose rubbed in this kind of
thing before you realise just how bad
it is. When you walk into Fremantle
Prison, you walk into a set of buildings
whose penal concepts are straight out of
the eighteenth century. Brian was per-
fectly willing to accept that it was better
for him to be executed rather than spend
the rest of his life there. If I had been
in the same position I would have felt
the same as he did.”
But Western Australia is a long way
from the abolition of capital punish-
ment. Those who mobilised with the
Anti-Hanging Committee were surprised
and shaken to find the depth of public
bitterness against them in the city.
Although at the end of the campaign
there were brave words from the com-
mittee, the public feeling for capital
punishment has been evident enough for
the Government to proceed with plans
for the hanging of Eric Edgar Cooke,
which will be the 34th Western Aus-
tralian hanging this century.
THE ITALIANS —I
Silence Along the River Flats
Padded Soil Floors on four-acre farms
FROM A MILDURA CORRESPONDENT
IIfHiLE the front of silence in the
" Italian community in Melbourne
has been cracking, along the Murray
there has been silence, even though
Father Aldo named Mildura and Robin-
vale as areas where poor growers were
suffering from exploitation by their
countrymen. There are about 2300
people of Italian birth living in the
Mildura district. One of the con-
centrations is 288 people in Wentworth
Shire, mostly in a small riverfront settle-
ment, Buronga, just across the river
from Mildura. These are nearly all
Calabrians.
They are market gardeners trying to
get a living out of blocks of land as
small as four acres. They work from
dawn till dark seven days a week and
put their trust in the agents through
whom they must sell their produce on
Melbourne or Sydney markets. Most of
them have not left their tiny farms since
the day they began working there.
Their homes are small and of weather-
board or cement sheet. Some have only


padded soil for floors. Many of these
small growers have no tractors or farm
vehicles of their own. They hire or
borrow machines from others to do the
occasional heavy work on the farms.
In an effort to get the most out of
their small areas of land they have
glasshouses for growing tomatoes in
usual out-of-season periods. They begin
with one glasshouse and gradually build
others if seasons are kind.
But apart from the occasional extra
glasshouse there is nothing to suggest that
the majority of these Italians have any
more money than is essential to keep
them alive.
Many have big families. The children
are always plainly dressed and many
go to school without shoes.
It is conservatively estimated that
Italians in the Mildura area have an
annual production of fruit and vegetables
worth one million pounds, but this sum
is not reflected in the general living
conditions of most of them.
However, some Italians display
evidence of great prosperity. Throughout
the 170 square miles of irrigation district
there are those who own several
properties, who have large homes and
run expensive cars. The whole Italian
community in the area is prosperous
enough to have built its own public hall
in Mildura.
In a place as prosperous as Mildura
there is no need for the conditions
existing among some Italians. There is
no open proof that these growers are
being bled by their fellow countrymen.
But Father Aldo has been through the
area recently, staying with Father Orsi,
the parish priest of Redcliff, near
Mildura. Father Orsi has so far been
silent but he went to Melbourne to
confer with Father Aldo immediately
following his statement. During Father
Aldo’s visit he went with Father Orsi
into a number of growers’ homes and
people here are drawing the reasonable
inference that much of the information
for his attack on the agents came from
his visit.
THE ITALIANS—II
Melbourne’s Crime Drama
The role of the Press
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
H. BOLTE
Open concern
IVlelbourne’s shotgun murders in the
Italian community have been front-
page news to papers all over Australia,
and of interest to many overseas.
In Melbourne, the morning “Sun” and
evening "Herald” have handled the story
as the biggest news since the late Presi-
dent Kennedy’s death. Twice the “Sun”
has run late editions to cover the
nocturnal developments in this com-
plex crime drama.
The first occasion was when the fifth
victim, Antonio Monaco, was shot
barely 12 hours after a reward of £5OOO
had been offered for information lead-
ing to the apprehension of the other
three victims’ assassin.
The other special “Sun” was last
Thursday, when the paper stayed open
to cover the dawn raid on the Victoria
Market by 180 armed detectives. This
edition, which was timed as appearing
at 6 a.m., covered developments in the
raid up to 5.20 a.m. It was excellent
journalism, produced with zest and
efficiency by an able team.
The “Herald” has not been far behind,
given that two of the dramatic killings
occurred around 3 a.m. Its front-page
coverage of the Muratore murder was
an outstanding piece of reporting and
layout, granted that the hard news had
already appeared in a late edition of the
“Sun”.
Melbourne’s other daily, the “Age”,
has not rated it so highly. In the past
week the only time the “Age” hoisted it
to real prominence on its front page was
when it published a Canberra despatch
in which the Immigration Minister, Mr
Opperman, said that Vincenzo Angil-
letta, the first shotgun victim, had a
clean record in Australia, despite his
conviction for crimes of violence in
Italy.
This was tame stuff, and showed Mr
Opperman very much on the defensive.
Psychologically, its effect was to be-
little the events to which the “Sun” and
“Herald” were devoting their front pages
and all their powers of writing and
presentation.
Last week the story took a new turn
when Fitzroy Catholic priest, Father
Aldo, was frontpaged by the “Sun” for
predicting that the fifth shotgun victim
would be Frank Madafferi, another Vic-
toria Market personality. The “Sun”
had this as an exclusive story on the
day that the “Age” published Mr Opper-
man’s version of events surrounding
Angilletta.
The next day, in a curt review of
developments, the “Age” stated that
Father Aldo had denied saying that
Madafferi was marked down for a shot-
gun attack. No elaboration was given,
but it was later learned that Father
Aldo had left Melbourne for a sojourn
in the country. Inside the “Age” was an
editorial, the tenor of which was to
imply that the other Melbourne papers
had been making a sensation out of the
case.
This was strange in view of the
Premier, Mr Bolte’s expressed concern
and while these words were being written
and printed, Victorian police were
assembling at Russell Street for one of
the biggest raids they had ever con-
ducted. The scale and thoroughness of
their swoop in the Victoria Market
proved that to the police, at any rate,
the killings in the Italian community con-
stituted one of their biggest challenges
for years.
For too long have standover practices
at the Victoria Market gone unnoticed.
In fact, if there is any criticism of the
Melbourne papers, it is not for sensa-
tionalising what are inherently dramatic
events, but for ignoring the situation for
so long.
UNIVERSITIES
T V or
Not TV
The Reluctant Professors?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
A polite dispute in Melbourne about
the use of educational television
within its two universities has raised some
dust over the last few weeks and also
revived the wider question of how far
University administrators are keeping up
with progress.
The Victorian Employers’ Federation,
which publishes more Press statements
than any of its counterparts, started the
battle—by taking up the banners in
favor of the use of closed-circuit tele-
vision by universities. The Federation
issued a four-page report with the pro-
vocative name of “The Reluctant Profes-
sors”. Its theme is that “conservatism
has been a major barrier in preventing


speedier approach to the use of television
in the universities.
The evidence for conservatism,
according to the report, comes from the
fact that although closed-circuit tele-
vision has been available to interested
faculties and departments in the Univer-
sity of Melbourne since 1955, the first
experiments were not undertaken until
1963 and then there were only three
trials.
The report says that television has
been proved to have a role in overcom-
ing accommodation and teacher short-
ages. Also it would be useful for show-
ing complicated experiments being con-
ducted on a small scale, because they
could be magnified so that all students
in a large class could see them.
The University of NSW is praised for
its pioneer work in the field in Aus-
tralia. (However, in Sydney the Univer-
sity of NSW still regards the use of
closed-circuit television as experimental.
It has been used with success in giving
color magnified pictures of a major
operation for medical students.)
The report also refers to an experi-
ment carried out at the Toorak Teachers’
College where students watched a ten-
year-old boy doing an intelligence test.
With a touch of humility after 500
words the Employers’ Federation report
says that “it is not for laymen to assert
that television should be widely used
in university training.” But it then adds
“what is being criticised is the way in
which academics seem to have spent
more time in thinking up reasons for
opposing television than they have in
finding out whether or not their reasons
are valid.”
What the report doesn't say clearly
is that Australian universities have not
yet attempted to make a full-scale re-
appraisal of lecturing techniques in the
changed conditions of the last decade.
The University of NSW has begun to
do so with a special Educational
Research Unit, but the tendency has
been to let the tutorial system slip into
bigger groups and let the lectures go on
as though it were Oxford or Glasgow in
the nineteenth century.
Melbourne University reaction was
that the Employers’ Federation criti-
cisms were premature. The Dean of the
Faculty of Medicine at Monash, Pro-
fessor Andrew, who had got some praise
in the report, went out to battle in de-
fence of his colleagues when he suggest-
ed that it was “not altogether a case of
reluctant professors but rather an over-
cautious Government which is delaying
the proper use of television in universi-
ties” and asked for Government money
as was recommended by a special com-

Then the disclosure followed that in

HOW TO FLOG
80 Years Ago: February 2, 1884
Two “medical gentlemen”, the AUS-
TRALASI AN MEDICAL
GAZETTE informs us, attended the
late flosaines at Woolloomooloo
■■from professional reasons”. These
worthies consider that the punishment
, -11 . ,
was got over too quickly, and that

the administering of twenty - five
lashes in less than three minutes did
not inflict sufficient pain on the
culprits. To avoid in future such a
leaning towards mawkish sensibility,
they propose \hat there should be an
interval of thirty seconds between
each stroke, so that the correction
“would be unutterably more severe,
without causing any more injury to
the man flogged, and with less shock
to the nervous system.” But their
suggestion does not end here. They
complain that “the lashes are ad-
ministered too much on one spot”,
and should be more impartially dis-
tributed, so that no portion of the
dorsal region could reasonably com-
plain of being neglected. Even this
does not exhaust their ingenuity. Half
the number of stripes should be
apportioned to the buttocks, “so that
t° r next fortnight or so the men
flogged would be in such a state as
to prefer standing to sitting . They

Three reforms for NSW
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
/Yne of the central problems confront-
ing penal authorities is the rate of
recidivism of young offenders. Figures
in NSW, the State with Australia's largest
prison population (about 3300), about
50 per cent of young offenders return a
second time and about 25 per cent a
third time.
It is this problem that the NSW Min-
ister of Justice, Mr N. J. Mannix, plans
to tackle. Mr Mannix spent a week in
New Zealand last month to study two
innovations in the penal system, Pre-
Release Hostels and Periodic Detention
Centres.
NSW has already been planning some
moves but Mr. Mannix returned from
New Zealand convinced that the success
of their experiments had been sufficiently
proven for NSW to go ahead without
delay.
New Zealand has two “Periodic De-
tention Centres”, one at Auckland and
the other at Hamilton, a North Island
farming centre. Juvenile first offenders,
i.e., those between 16-20 in NZ, are
sentenced to a period of so many hours’
detention. At the magistrate's discretion
it may be served at the weekend or on
week-nights at the centres. The youths
are given work to do.
The Pre-Release Hostel of which there
is still only one, in Auckland, is designed
to deal with prisoners who have served
most of their term. The Auckland insti-
tution, set in a large old house, takes
juvenile offenders for the last few months
of their sentence.
The youths live in the hostel but go
out to work during the day. At night
they have to work in the hostel and they
also pay a board of £4 a week. The
Auckland centre has been in operation
for over a year. At first it encountered
strong local opposition, because it was
set in a quiet residential area but penolo-
gists are proud that there have been no
local complaints.
New Zealand has also successfully
carried out an experiment that has long
interested Mr Mannix —sending out
maintenance offenders to work. At present
New Zealand is sending between 30

and 40 adult prisoners out to work, al-
most all of them maintenance offenders.
Mr. Mannix is harshly practical about
the arguments in favor of the projected
reforms. He took the portfolio of Justice
about four years ago, after being an
assistant Minister for two years. Not
long after taking the job Mr Mannix
came under bitter political attack from
the Opposition for the release of a con-
vict on parole, who subsequently murder-
ed two people. He puts the arguments
in favor of the projected changes in
NSW as “a way of disciplining first
offenders and saving the taxpayers
money”. In addition if maintenance
offenders can be sent out to work they
can be made to make a contribution to
the families’ upkeep from their salaries.
At present maintenance offenders who go
to gaol can take out their spite on their
families. Further, they cannot be put
on to work in gaol, so in the words of
the Minister “they rot” until they have
cancelled out their arrears at the rate of
£.l a day.
THE TERRITORY
The Passing of the
Croc Hunters
Stopping gin burglary
FROM PETER BLAKE IN DARWIN
C. E. BARNES
A deputation
Tt looks like that colorful battler of the
-*■ north, the professional crocodile
shooter, has had his chips in the
Territory. Ironically the death blow to
the croc hunter has come at a time when
world prices for hides have never been
higher.
The reason for it is legislation in-
troduced in the NT Legislative Council
a little over a year ago to tighten up
control over and protection of the
Territory’s wild life, and a recently
gazetted regulation applying to Arnhem
Land. Few realised when the Wild Life
Protection Ordinance was introduced
that its implications would be so great.
It was considerably amended in many
respects, but, as far as croc shooters
were concerned, its teeth were not even
blunted. As things stand now, shooting
of the fresh-water, fish-eating crocodile
(Johnstoni) is prohibited, and the species
is completely protected.
In times when the big, cagey and
highly-priced salt-water estuarine crocs
are getting harder to find, the trusting
Johnstonii offered an easy target to
shooters.
In previous years prices have been
too low to make fresh-water crocs worth
the trouble; most hunters have left them
strictly alone. They are much smaller
than the salt-water croc, and their hides
harder to tan.
Hunters can clean out a lagoon in
a night, getting up to 50 skins. Once a
lagoon is shot out, it stays that way,
because the Johnstoni is not a great
traveller.
Fear that the species would be wiped
out altogether, and they are not
completely unfounded, prompted their
protection under the Wild Life Ord-
inance.
The Government held off proclaiming
the Ordinance till the end of the present
season, and it came into force on
January 1.
Another section of the Ordinance lays
down that all croc shooters must be
licensed. One intriguing condition of
such a licence is that it can be endorsed
to limit the size and sex of any estuarine
croc.
Snorted veteran shooter, and now a
skin buyer in Darwin, Roy Mofiatt, “I've
been in the game for years, and even
then I can only tell the sex of a ‘gator
if I see two of them lying together no
more than a few yards away”.
But a still bigger blow to the liveli-
hood of the professional croc hunter is
a seemingly innocent regulation recently
gazetted.
The Territory’s Welfare Branch,
which looks after the aborigines, has
long been leery of croc shooters because
of their reputation for gin burglary along
the lonely coasts of Arnhem Land.
Welfare has done its best to keep
unauthorised people out of Arnhem Land,
which has always been the mecca of the
croc hunters, because its thousands of
mangrove-fringed tidal creeks and rivers
are the natural home of the big reptiles.
As things stood previously nobody
could set foot in Arnhem Land above
the high water mark. Naturally enough
this still gave croc hunters plenty of
scope to operate within the law.
But under a new regulation pro-
hibition extends to the low water mark.
This effectively keeps the shooters from
entering the rivers and creeks and
provides stiff penalties if they are
caught.
Darwin’s biggest skin buyer, Irwin
Ridsdale, organised a deputation of croc
shooters which saw the Minister for
Territories, Mr C. E Barnes, on bis first
visit to Darwin this week.
Mr Ridsdale said already a dozen or
more men who were working the fresh-

The Killing
of Captain Cook
“Executive fatigue ”
By M. H. ELLIS
JAMES COOK
One fatal error
Dr Beaglehole’s presidential address
to the History Section of Anzaas
on The Death of Captain Cook was the
product of a type and intensity of
original research rare in Australia among
academics. It is a valuable character
study.
The known facts about Cook’s tragedy
are clear, as far as they go. After cold
months in the Behring Sea and there-
abouts seeking the tempting reward of
£20,000, then “on the bead” of the
elusive North West Passage, he had
sailed southward with the two ships
Resolution and Discovery to be received
with reverence as a divine visitor and
housed in a holy enclosure by the forth-
coming residents of the shores of Keala-
kekua Bay in Hawaii. Hospitality seemed
boundless, supplies were rendered up at
first lavishly (with free wives for dis-
count). The one fly in the ointment was
the illogical communism of locals whose
motto was unflinchingly governed by the
proverb, “What’s yours is mine”. They
stole with gay abandon and seemed to
develop a grievance when checked. Cook
left 18 days after coming to anchor. He
returned reluctantly and only because
there was no other place in which to
-refit after a squall had sprung the fore-
mast of his ship.
When he came back, the temper of
the inhabitants was not so welcoming
as before. They gave less, they stole
much more. Everybody was in a bad
temper; those in the ships stole right up
to the captain, the crew more bent on
free ladies and dolce far niente as
practised in the Pacific Ocean than on
holystones and splicing. They were
quite ready to take out their own griev-
ances on any handy native and relation-
ships had not been improved by the fact
that Cook seems to have affronted
religious sensibilities in the island by
seeking to buy the palings round the
holy heiau in which he had dwelt in
honor as a supposed divinity, and
desecrating the sacred enclosure in
which neither birth nor death were per-
mitted, by burying in it the body of a
defunct seaman.
There was disorder. Theft increased
in extent and nature until Cook felt
bound to employ the old expedient of
taking a hostage chieftain into the ship
to act as ransom for the return of the
Discovery’s stolen cutter. He went ashore
with armed marines for the purpose, not
even arranging proper cover from the
ships for his party.
Cook was mild of temper only some-
times. At this stage he was weary from
long responsibility and contact with offi-
cers like his master, Bligh of the Bounty,
and from extra duty due to the illness of
senior adjutants. He was also apparently
in a state of cyclonic anger which pro-
duced unusually savage punishment for
his crew and, what was worse, of momen-
tarily infirm judgment.
It is hard enough for a cool hand to
deal with seemingly pacific natives un-
accustomed to white men. In the most
passive-seeming circumstances, they are
apt to take sudden fright and begin
throwing spears, as Captain Arthur Phillip
discovered at the cost of a very sore
arm on Manly Beach in 1790. In condi-
tions which call for threat, and perhaps
reprisal, against such people there is only
one rule —which Cook forgot. The
whole focus of the actual reason for bis
death can be pin-pointed in a subsidiary
sentence in Dr Beaglehole’s elaborate
essay on his hero’s emotional make-up
and its product in history of his relation-
ships with crews and natives. He “over-
estimated the effect of musket fire”.
In other words he forgot the rule that
if force must be used as a threat against
savages untutored in the power of
modern arms, it must, in the interest of
both efficiency and humanity, be not only
overwhelming, but appear to be so.
Experience should have proved to him
long before, as it proved to Wallis in
the Dolphin off the Tahitian Coast in
June, 1967, that, once the gay, wife-
proffering children of the Pacific Eden
were roused, even the persistent firing
of a ship’s great guns would not deter
them from attack, though they might be
armed only with stones. For the
moment Cook was out of reach of the
guiding “hand of experience”. This was
his fatal mistake.


OUT AND ABOUT
Camelot: J.C.W.’s Strike Oil Again
Business as usual for The Firm
By PATRICIA ROLFE
JC. Williamson’s have gone into
# 1964, which is the 90th anniversary
of John Cassius Williamson s ar-
rival from America to play “Struck Oil”
here, with a song in their hearts. The
song is likely to be from either “Came-
lot” or “How to Succeed in Business
Without Really Trying,” two musical
comedies happily referred to by the Firm
as “blockbusters”. Between them, these
two musical comedies could make a good
deal of difference to the Firm’s
operations this year.
Williamson’s admit that after five
years they needed another “My Fair
Lady,” and in “Camelot,” rather sur-
prisingly, they seem to have found it.
“Camelot ’ opened in Adelaide at the
end of November, and will move to
Melbourne on February 22. Advance
bookings and business in Adelaide were
better than for "My Fair Lady,”
although Adelaide, Festival of Arts not-
withstanding, is considered something of
a theatrical graveyard. “Cameiot” is ex-
pected to run a year in Melbourne. This
year Sydney will have to make do with
How to Succeed in Business Without
Really Trying,” which has had six
months of near-capacity business in Mel-
bourne, proving the Firm’s biggest
musical comedy success, "My Fair
Lady excepted, for 10 years.
Its a cheering prospect for William-
son s. How much the firm needed
another My Fair Lady was clear in
the company’s accounts to June 30,
1963, published mid-January. Net profit
of J. C. Williamson Ltd and its sub*
sidiaries slumped by 67 per cent from
a record of £216,939 for the previous
year to £71,638. Dividend was cut
from 17i per cent to 10 per cent. The
directors in their report said that the
high 1961-62 profit reflected the success
of “My Fair Lady” and the compara-
tively poor result for the past year was
due to increasing costs and the lack of
attractions “in any way comparable
with ‘My Fair Lady’.”
“Camelot” was not only the most
expensive production the Firm has staged
—£loo,ooo spent before the curtain
rose, against £70,000 for “My Fair
Lady”—but it was a considerable risk.
“Camelot” had poor critical reception
in New York where it was dismissed
as a handsome bore. But on the strength
of the Lerner and Loewe reputation,
gained from “My Fair Lady,” it had
enormous advance bookings. However,
“Camelot” has not yet been presented
in London. H. M. Tennent’s were wary
of it and no other management has so
far taken it on.
Still, a theatrical organisation which
can afford to spend £lOO,OOO on one
production must be fairly well cushioned
against disaster. With Williamson’s there
are no last-throw gambles, as might take
place on Broadway or in the West End,
and none of Broadway’s brutal one-
night runs. But on the other hand,
there is no large floating audience
which can be trapped into things like
“The Mousetrap” year after year,
J. C. Williamson’s is now almost
certainly the world’s largest single coin-
mercial theatrical enterprise. It owns or
operates for stage presentation two
theatres in Sydney, two in Melbourne,
three in New Zealand, one in Adelaide,
one in Brisbane, with access to Edgley’s
His Majesty’s in Perth. Most entre-
preneurs in other places merely lease
theatres. Tennent’s do not own theatres
nor, since the Schubert organisation
broke up, do many American manage-
ments.
So Williamson’s on the score that
they both own theatres and act as entre-
preneurs come out as larger than London
counterparts who have to find a theatre
before they can put on a play, or
American ones, who generally have to
find both a theatre and a band of angels
before they can think any further ahead,
Williamson’s also make their own sets
and costumes, which elsewhere are
generally done under contract
But there is no virtue in size itself,
This is apparent even to those within
the Williamson empire,
Williamson people tend to grow de-
fensive about their firm’s operations.
This is mostly the wearing-down effect
of constantly rubbing shoulders with
people who see the theatre as something

mystic, wonderful, and who feel that
the responsibilty of those managing
theatres is to the theatre and not to
audiences or shareholders. Williamson’s
come back at this with a brisk, no-
nonsense, “We’re in the game to make
money for our shareholders.”
Reluctantly they will admit that there
are such things as prestige presentations.
How else can you classify Sir John
Gielgud and Marcel Marceau? William-
son’s will then admit that they do things
with one eye on the firm’s “name” and
the other on the box-office. The result
of doing things this way is measurable
as goodwill, which Williamson’s in their
last published accounts, to June 30,
1962, placed at £190,000.
Running in cycles
T>UT everything that Williamson’s do,
from Gielgud to knockabout farce, has
one aim—to keep their theatres open.
A winning formula will not keep on
winning. Taste in theatre seems to go
in cycles so that some types of enter-
tainment are stronger over a period of
years than others, but because you do
well with “My Fair Lady’ doesn’t
guarantee success —or failure —for the
next musical you put on.
Most of Williamson’s energies go in
keeping their shows moving across the
Commonwealth and New Zealand so
that there is a minimum time when
theatres are dark.
Williamson’s must buy when the
plays and musicals they want are on
offer. Sometimes they cannot know
exactly until many months later how
and where they are going to open with
a particular show and what sort of run
they will be able to give it. In this they
are in a very different position from
that other large entrepreneur, the Aus-
tralian Broadcasting Commission. The
commission has its orchestras in each
State and has only to move its solo
artists. A musician may go across the
continent two or three times in the
course of a long tour, but moving the
whole cast of a musical comedy is an
expensive and complicated proceeding.
Williamson’s appear to have the
advantage over other entrepreneurs in
always having a theatre ready for a
show, but this can work against you as
well as for you. Mr Garnet Carroll
with the Princess in Melbourne and the
Capital in Perth has to find theatres for
his successes in other States, but he can,
if it seems wisest, shrink or expand his
activities until he finds the shows he
wants and he need go interstate only
with proven successes. But the William-
son behemoth must move on.
The Williamson enterprise is a good
deal more complex than is suggested
by those who believe that the company’s
investments in property enable it to
carry on its theatrical ventures. “William-
son’s own half of Castlereagh Street,”
is the way it usually goes. The other
theory is that Williamson’s made enough
money out of reviving “The Maid of
the Mountains” to live off its financial
fat forever.
The company has gone through some
vicissitudes since the original J. C.
Williamson came here. In 1920 Wil-
liamson’s amalgamated with J. and N.
Tait. In 1938 several of the largest
shareholders sold out their interest and
a new company, Australian and New
Zealand Theatres Ltd, was formed. This
gave financial control to the New
Zealand interests of McKenzie’s chain
stores, but within a year, which saw
some fairly unfortunate ventures, J. C.
Williamson Ltd formed a wholly-owned
subsidiary, J. C. Williamson Theatres
Ltd. Control of the theatre side was
back in the hands of the Taits, notably
Sir Frank.
Since 1952 J. C. Williamson Ltd has
not been listed. From that date until
1962, when the new Companies’ Act
was proclaimed, Williamson’s did not
publish its result. Now it does. The first
published balance sheet to June 30,
1962, was surprising, if only because it
reminded Australians that the majority
shareholding was still in the hands of
New Zealanders. It showed that that
year’s record net profit of £216,939
came mainly from the theatre, property
investment yielding only 20 per cent of
the net. This year’s result shows how
much the Firm depends on its “block-
busters.”
So owning half of Castlereagh Street
does not keep Williamson’s going.
Williamson’s actually do not even own
the Theatre Royal, leasing it from the
heirs of Gustavo Ramaciotti, an original
partner of J. C. Williamson. They
did own land near Park Street which
they sold to Consolidated Press recently.
They own the Regent Theatre in George
Street and have a large shareholding in
the Prince Edward in Castlereagh Street,
which may soon go for development.
They also own Her Majesty’s at Railway
Square, but sold the site of the original
Her Majesty’s in Market Street to Wool-
worths some years ago.
Looking back in the theatre it is easy
to remember the successes and let the
failures slip your mind. If Williamson’s
now seem to be on a good patch, last
year’s Sydney list is sobering.
At Her Majesty’s the year began
with Tibor Rudas’s “Cinderella,” with
Williamson’s collecting the rent. Then
Marcel Marceau, very successful; “The
Pirates of Penzance,” not too good; “My
Fair Lady” revival, not nearly as big
as the first season; Victor Borge, not
as good as his first tour; the Georgian
State Dance Company, a big success;
“Sail Away,” not much business; “Annie
Get Your Gun” revival not too good,
and “The Merry Widow,” just so-so.
At the Royal it was “Woman in a
Dressing Gown,” very good; “Carnival,”
very bad; “A Shot in the Dark,” not
much business; “The Season at Sarsa-
parilla,” a flop; “Who’ll Come A-
Waltzing,” another flop; Joyce Grenfell,
excellent; “Goodnight, Mrs Puffin,”
good business; John Gielgud, excellent
business; “Mary, Mary,” good.
Theatre remains utterly unpredictable.
Almost every play or musical that
Williamson’s have put on has broken
some sort of record, or some sort of rule.
Recently “Goodnight, Mrs. Puffin” on a
return season in Melbourne did better
business than it had during its first run
•—almost unprecedented in the theatre
anywhere.
There is piquancy in the fact that
success in Melbourne often seems to
guarantee poor houses in Sydney, and
vice-versa. All reputation to the contrary,
Sydney is a better theatre town than
Melbourne. At least, it is more sophisti-
cated. Gilbert and Sullivan still does
well in Melbourne but seems pretty old
hat to Sydney audiences. Anthony
Quayle’s Shakespeare company did better
in Sydney than Melbourne. Robert
Helpmann vows he has never had a
success in Melbourne. The New York
City Ballet was a flop in Melbourne,
but did much better in Sydney. If you
really want to take it back, Pavlova did
better in Sydney than Melbourne.
Cyril Ritchard in “The Pleasure of
His Company” broke the house record
in one week for a straight play at the
Theatre Royal but was a flop in Mel-
bourne. “Oliver” was a greater success
in Sydney than Melbourne, so was John
Alden’s Shakespeare company.
Surprise successes
T>UT, of course, there are some actors
who consistently draw audiences. At
the top of the list for J. C. Williamson’s
at present, for consistency and availability
is Miss Googie Withers, who is married
to the firm’s joint managing director,
Mr John McCallum.
One of the surprise successes of the
past few years has been the one-man
show. Williamson’s has brought out
Maurice Chevalier, Danny Kaye, Victor
Borge, Marcel Marceau, Joyce Grenfell
and John Gielgud. These have all been
successful. Chevalier was the least
successful financially.
What does Williamson’s look for to
fill its theatres? They look first for the
big musical comedy, which, if successful,
is the strong, long-term prospect, although
the profit percentage from a musical is
no higher than from a successful play.
Straight plays come mainly from
London. What used to be called a
drawing-room comedy or a Theatre
Royal play is now —perhaps mercifully


-—in short supply, but Williamson’s are
still looking for them.
Terence Rattigan and William Douglas
Home were the white-haired boys with
“The Reluctant Debutante,” “The Deep
Blue Sea” and so on. Then there were
“Woman in a Dressing Gown.” “Simon
and Laura,” “Nude with Violin” and
“Roar Like a Dove.” But Williamson's
felt that Enid Bagnold’s “The Chalk
Garden” represented exactly what they
were looking for. There w ; as a drawing-
room setting to keep the Theatre Royal
patrons happy and enough high-sounding
dialogue to persuade some of those who
talk about serious theatre.
Farce, w'hich came on strongly after
the war with “Seagulls over Sorrento,”
“Reluctant Heroes” and “Worm’s Eye
View” has little draw now 7, although Mr
Irving classified “Goodnight, Mrs Puffin”
as farce.
Tastes change and Williamson’s
audiences, although in no simple fashion,
are changing too. The theatre-reared
audience is growing older, dying off.
There is now a potential audience, which
is accustomed to television and licensed
clubs but w'hich is larger and better off
than the older established theatregoers.
There are still many types of plays
which Williamson’s won’t touch. The
short list of “better” plays they have done
recently includes “Tw'o for the See-Saw,”
which was not a success, “The Miracle
Worker,” which lost large sums in both
Sydney and Melbourne and “The Diary
of Anne Frank.” w'hich lost money too.
Of Tennessee Williams they have done
only “A Streetcar Named Desire.” This
did good business but they haven’t played
Williams since.
They will not touch “kitchen sink.”
They defy you to name one play of this
genre which would have made money
for them in theatres the size of those
they operate. But there still seem to be
some modern plays which could come
within Williamson's commercial cate-
gories. For example, Osborne’s “Luther”
which is doing well on Broadway, or
Rattigan’s “Ross”.
On Australian plays Williamson’s are
somewhat disillusioned and mostly off
the record.
Resting on Laurels
exigencies of commercial theatre
always seem to have made William-
son’s activities in the drama haphazard,
with simple comedies succeeding Bern-
hardt and melodrama mixed with Thorn-
dike and Casson. But Williamson’s can
lay strong claim to establishing both
opera and ballet in this country.
Unfortunately, in both these fields
Williamson’s may now have to rest on
their laurels, looking back to the great
days of Melba and Pavlova. Williamson’s
do not believe that they could profitably
present opera w'ith imported casts in
this country now'. They brought Italian
companies here in 1948 and 1955. Costs
rose so sharply in those seven years that
in 1955 Williamson's lost almost the
same sum that it had made on the 1948
season.
Williamson’s point to the £IOO,OOO
loss which the Australian Ballet
Company sustained in its first year and
remind you that they successfully
sponsored the Borovansky company for
many years. It's not a fair comparison.
In Borovansky Williamson’s found a
director ideally suited to their require-
ments, which were simple, that is to
operate at a profit and not to try any-
thing, or at least anything much, which
might seem too advanced to ballet-
lovers.
Although Williamson's have gradually,
and perhaps temporarily, moved out of
these fields, they do w'ork in association
with the Elizabethan Theatre Trust and
other managements on various projects.
In fact, nowadays the list of people jointly
sponsoring a presentation is nearly as
long as the cast. For these joint-pre-
sentations, the entrepreneurs involved
open a bank account into which every-
thing connected w'ith the presentation
is paid and out of which all expenses
are met. At the end. if the venture has
been unprofitable the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust dips into its subsidy and William-
son’s or any other commercial manage-
ment concerned keep smiling.
Relations between Williamson's, the
Elizabethan and the other commercial
managements are generally cordial.
When any one of them at any time may
need either a theatre in which to place
a show or a show' to fill a theatre, this
is the only working arrangement. In
general it is taken that the more theatres
there are the most people are likely to
get the theatre-going habit and the
better it will be in the long run for
everyone concerned.
Although the unions connected with
the theatre here are not generally so
fiercely militant or demanding as those
on Broadway, there seem to be some
specific provisions which make things
difficult for management here. For
example, once a player is cast and the
play is in rehearsal, he is put under
contract and the only way the manage-
ment can make a change is by buying
out his contract. “We have bought out
contracts time and time again,” a
Williamson representative said, “but
obviously you can't go on doing it for
ever.” In America a player is not put
under contract until the show has been
running a month, when the show 7 and
the player have proved their worth.
One area of Williamson’s activities
which has shrunk almost out of existence
is the concert business. This was usually
under the management of J. and N.
Tait. Two years ago they brought out
Marian Anderson. Within recent years
they have brought out Menuhin and
David Oistrakh, in association with the
ABC, and Jan Peerce. However the
ABC’s hold on available concert halls
for the greater part of the year makes
concert activities almost entirely un-
workable for anyone else.
This may change to some extent when
the Sydney Opera House, Canberra's
National Theatre and the Melbourne
Cultural Centre are finished and perhaps
other projects in smaller centres are
under way. Although Williamson’s, in
common with most people connected
with the arts, think of the Sydney Opera
House as Charlie Moses' concert hall,
they believe that it will be available
for commercial productions and think
it entirely possible that they will make
presentations there.
Strong on Tradition
TTOWEVER, Williamson’s have no
grand plan for the future of theatre
in Australia. It is inevitable that a firm
90 years old should be strong on tradi-
tion in a calling which makes such a big
thing of tradition. All the offices in Wil-
liamson House, adjoining the Theatre
Royal, have photographs of Cyril and
Madge as young stars, or posters from
“Chu Chin Chow 7 ,” w'hich must serve to
remind any new, young hopefut that Wil-
liamson's have seen them come and go
many times. Most fascinating is the lib-
rary. which Williamson's believe to be the
largest of its type in the world. In a
fireproof room and guarded from rats
as best they can be, is the book of every
presentation Williamson's have ever put
on, from the original script of William-
son's ‘'Struck Oil.” There are operettas
in authors’ handwriting, the librettos of
operas Nellie Melba sang, the author's
manuscript of “The Squatter's Daughter.”
The man w'ho still seems to have his
eye to the future in Williamson’s is 80-
years-old Sir Frank Tait, joint managing
director with Mr John McCallum. Mr
McCallum may have done exactly the
job which Williamson's expected of him
when they brought him back from
London stage and film work, but to
the outside eye he has not given the
Firm the new image which a younger
talent might have been expected to give
it. The Williamson’s directorate is now
Harald Bowden, Claude Kingston, Harry
Strachan and the firm's London repre-
sentative, Charles Doming, all of whom
have given long service to the theatre.
Williamson’s see no major changes
in their enterprise in the immediate
future. They are unlikely to build any
new theatres or to alter their enter-
tainment formula drastically. They will
continue to try to give the customers
what they want and leave others to
mould public taste.


The Professions
4. Conversation with
a Surgeon
"He has to he something of an athlete ..."
By PETER HASTINGS
Since it’s in the air, what do you think
of Professor Marshall’s charge the other
day that “medicine was one of the few
professions in which industrious dolts
could earn £5,000 a year.” Is that true?
Of course it’s true. I need say no more.
Does the brilliant student necessarily
become a brilliant doctor?
No. Plenty do, of course. But many
who top their final years just fall by the
wayside. You need more than brilli-
ance to become a top specialist. One of
the things you need is social intelligence,
a feeling for the world and for people.
Since we’re talking about specialists
and, in particular, surgeons, why did you
become a surgeon?
An accident, really, as it was for most
of my contemporaries who became
specialists.
Did you have no special qualifications?
Oh, yes, we all had. Good degrees,
the top teaching hospitals and so on.
We certainly went for specialisation once
we became doctors. I only meant that
few if any of us approached medicine
with that idea in the back of our mind.
What took you into specialisation?
I became interested in general surgery
and did quite a bit of it. I then became
interested in my special field, took a
higher degree in Edinburgh and on my
return to Australia gradually became
known professionally.
What’s required of a specialist?
I think he has to have a gift for his
field, an intellectual curiosity about it
and a sense of professional integrity. You
know we soon get to know whether a
man has the goods or not. A specialist
of repute prizes above all else the respect
of his peers which is never given lightly.
What about the surgeon?
I think I’d add to the qualities I’ve
just mentioned those of concentration,
precise judgment, guts and imagination.
Anything else in particular?
The capacity to recognise that some-
thing better may turn up tomorrow plus
a considerable physical stamina. A top
surgeon has to be a bit of an athlete.
He has to be as good and his hands as
steady four hours after he’s begun an
operation as when he started. It’s a bit
like a five-set tennis match. It’s the last
set that counts.
What about his “fine hands” and so
on?
Mostly myth. There are a lot of
myths in medicine. One is that there is
nothing quite so delicate, demanding and
complicated as neuro-surgery. I’ve seen
it and it’s very dull and tedious.
As a young man I thought I might
specialise in ophthalmology until I saw
one or two eye operations. I thought
I’d never seen anything look so botched
and bungled. It wasn’t, of course, but
there was nothing delicate about it. It
put me off.
Are surgeons as vain as they are
sometimes painted?
Some of them talk too much
especially about themselves.' Most of
them are rather modest, hard working,
painstaking and concerned with and for
their patients. The days of the great
swashbuckling surgeons whose word was
law for hospitals and patients alike are
gone.
Anything else gone?
Yes—the old system of the specialists
graduating from general practice. Nowa-
days the bright young men seek to
specialise immediately they have com-
pleted their teaching hospital year.
How do surgeons learn their trade as
such?
The very best ones get it through the
apprenticeship system which is still the
best. The really great names in surgery
were all apprenticed once to the best
surgeons. I was apprenticed—that is an
assistant—to a very eminent surgeon. It
meant I did most of his weekend work
for him and had little time to myself.
But I learnt an awful lot. In fact the
other day I had a patient who asked me
if (in the course cf a very specialised
operation) I would remove a growth
from his leg. I cut the growth out and
stitched him up quite neatly. The
theatre sister said, “Fancy you being
able to do general surgery like that.”
I was quite put out.
Do surgeons earn as much as some-
times reputed?
I don’t know. There are probably 200
general surgeons in Macquarie St of
whom five, perhaps 10, earn between
<£20,000 and £30,000 a year. Now
I’d hazard a guess that Macquarie St
contains about 45 ophthalmologists, 30
urologists, 50 orthopaedic surgeons, 45

Does your office still bottleneck inter-office

its quota of incoming/outgoing calls? □
Time you discovered Philiphone ease—and
started saving time. The Philips inter-office
communication system was designed to do
things even the latest switchboards can’t

Philiphone have two calling positions, giving
any sender direct and instant contact with
12 other personnel (one at g time) or any
six, at the same time! □ A Philips intercom.
system is the quickest, simplest and most
eco'no'mical way to make inter office calls.

HELP
all the year round
ENT men, 20 neuro-surgeons, 75 anaes-
thetists, not to mention psychiatrists,
thoracic surgeons, dermatologists and
God knows what else. In fact about one-
quarter of the medical population com-
prises specialists of one sort or another.
Now those top men in those various
categories would probably earn about
£lO,OOO a year.
That’s not bad, is it?
It’s not sensational either. It’s certainly
better than pre-war when the bulk of
specialists were probably not earning
more than £lOOO a year. When I re-
turned from Edinburgh with an FRCS
in the mid-thirties I earned only £7O in
eight months and I had a wife and family
to keep. I made between £4OOO and
£5OOO a year a few years later but I
earned every penny of it.
Then you don’t regard your very top
and near top specialist surgeons as over-
paid?
No, I don’t. Surgeons aren’t big
earners compared with accountants and
leading barristers. A surgeon, any
specialist for that matter, is only over-
paid if he’s lazy or greedy or inefficient.
I am somewhat sceptical, for example,
of those GPs earning £12,000 a year
or more. It sounds a bit like a factory.
However, the really hardworking special-
ist —and he is hardworking if he’s any
good—is by no means overpaid.
What about overheads?
Fiendish. There’s a three-man prac-
tice I know well in the building next to
this one. They were telling me the other
day that overheads accounted for be-
tween 25 per cent and 30 per cent of
the practice’s gross takings. The break-
down was £3OOO a year for two suites
of rooms, £5OOO yearly for secretarial,
£4OO yearly for telephones, £7OO
yearly for postage and stationery, £ 1400
for car maintenance —about £10,500
per annum. That’s a lot and specialists
haven’t bad fee increases for about two
years while costs keep rising. Rates
and taxes on this building, for instance,
have risen from £2900 to £BlOO in
one year. The tenants have to meet that
cost.
Excuse me—a moment ago you men-
tioned hard-working surgeons. How
hard-working are they?
Surprisingly so. Consultation, patient
care and surgery are very time-consum-
ing. I will not, for instance, apologise
for keeping anyone waiting. I will not
hurry through one patient to examine
another. When you hurry you miss
things and might make a mistake.
Have you ever made mistakes?
We all have.
How do you keep up?
Intensive reading. And travelling. I
have been to the US and Europe a num-
ber of times since the war and I might
add it’s very expensive. But travelling
as a means of keeping up with new
developments is very important.
How do Australian specialists rate
with those in the UK and the US?
We have nothing to fear by com-
parison with specialists in the UK. The
top in Britain is very good and always
has been but it’s fragmented. US
specialists, however, are several years
ahead. You ask why and the answer, I
suppose, is the US economy. All that
money going into laboratories, facilities
and research. That sort of thing. If a
surgeon or specialist writes a paper in
the US it is immediately printed and
widely distributed. Everyone gets to
read it. However, although the
Americans are so far ahead in many
respects I think the British intellectual
approach to medicine is better dis-
ciplined and founded. Ours likewise.
The Americans are frequently too
venturesome. It’s interesting that in
Canada, right next door to the US, the
approach is much more conservative
and the standard of practice and re-
search is so high.
How do Sydney top surgeons compare
with those in Melbourne, Brisbane and
Adelaide?
We’re well ahead of Brisbane and
Adelaide. It’s a matter of how long
medical schools have been established,
availability of teaching hospitals and so
on. Adelaide is ahead of Brisbane simply
because its medical school is older. Mel-
bourne is a different cup of tea. We’re
ahead in seme way and they’re ahead in
others. Twenty years ago Sydney had a
distinct edge. Forty years ago a decisive
edge. Think of the great Sydney names
of the past, general surgeons like Edie
and Poate, Craig and McKelvie who
really pioneered techniques in surgery
connected with thyroid, urology, ortho-
paedics, the prostate and so on. I could
mention many other names of course.
However, Melbourne’s caught up. For
one thing they admit only 200 students
to first year medicine. Here, by law, the
university must admit all qualifying
matriculants and you get the absurdity
of 600 students. The ideal is about 200.
In the US, Harvard, with all its resources
admits only 200 a year, and Yale only
60. In addition there’s a Dean of Ad-
missions who vets the student in every
way. It’s not enough to be a matriculant.
Anyway, to answer your question in a
nutshell, there are differences between
the Australian States but with greater
facilities and more resources the dif-
ferences are breaking down fast. The
insularity of medicine is disappearing.
With all your experience and the fact
that you obviously have made money in
medicine, do you think it as attractive
a profession as it once was?
No, I don’t. Or at least it doesn’t
appear so. Science, government, tech-
nical industries and business are com-
peting for graduates. That drains off
some of the brains we would otherwise
get. Before the war medicine offered
social prestige and financial rewards un-
matched by other professions except
law —and certainly unmatched by busi-
ness, government and other sources of
employment which nowadays offer 9-to-
-5 jobs, superannuation, cars and fringe
benefits. That’s one reason, I suspect,
why the group medical practice has be-
come so popular—duty rosters, days off,
etc. It’s a powerful attraction.
A personal question. Has anyone ever
tried to bribe you?
No. It’s a bit difficult in my line but
I’ve known many attempts to bribe
surgeons v/ho have to prescribe expensive
equipment and appliances for patients.
You can probably guess what. You’d
be surprised at the respected firms in this
country which approach surgeons and
suggest that if the surgeon recommends
that his patients -patronise a particular
firm for what they need, the firm will
refer clients to the specialist as patients.
That’s why I religiously recommend a
panel of names to any patient of mine.
I never recommend one firm in par-
ticular, even if I thought its appliance
or servicing a bit better.
Are bribes of this nature taken?
Very seldom I should think.
What’s the commonest form of un-
ethical behavior?
I’m not sure, but the hardest to put
down, and a vicious one at that, is


“That was
London...
and yet it
sounded like
a local call”
m
» ■>
\
Of course! ; . . because all Telephone calls to London now
travel via COMPAC, the new Commonwealth Pacific Cable
which extends to New Zealand, Fiji, Britain, Europe and
North America.
Regardless of whether your call is to London or Los Angeles
the clarity is equivalent to that of a local call.
If your business demands a large volume of overseas contact,
check the advantages of installing Telex or Leased services.
It costs less than you think to ’phone Overseas a 3 minute
call to New Zealand is only 37/6; to London 75/- (minimum rate).

dichotomy or fee splitting. A GP agrees
to refer his patients to a particular
specialist for a part of the specialist’s
fees, maybe a quarter, a half or what-
ever the amount may be.
But how does the specialist get around
the problem of payments?
Quite simply. He pays the GP as an
assistant. It’s quite legal that way. Years
ago a specialist friend of mine was
approached by a GP to do business
along these lines. The GP was to under-
take all post-operative care of the
specialist’s patients and get paid for it
of course. Actually I don’t think there
is much of it in NSW, certainly nothing
on the scale practised in the US and
Europe. Ethical standards in NSW are
high. I mean this. I think a lot of
it is due to the example set by Sir
Charles Blackburn who is not only a
physician of world distinction but a man
who has given medicine in this country
tremendous standards.
As a surgeon practising on your own,
what do you think of the partnership
system for top surgeons?
It’s a vexed question and it depends
on the partners, especially on the senior
partner who has to make the wheels go
round and keep them oiled. There are
disadvantages in the system but I think
I would prefer it to the unceasing, some-
what lone wolf existence of a leading
general surgeon who has only his assist-
ant or apprentice to fall back on.
Do surgeons feel superior to
physicians?
Not at all, although I’ve known some
physicians who felt superior to surgeons.
A leading physician is superior in some
ways, in the sense that he frequently
enjoys an intellectual edge over the
surgeon. He has to read more widely
and more deeply. He has to take a much
greater number of factors into considera-
tion when making a diagnosis. Surgery
for all its complications at times is more
straightforward.
A leading Sydney silk told me some
time ago that one of the dangers in law
is that top barristers can go out of
fashion, that solicitors change their
briefing habits. Is that true of a surgeon?
I don't think so. The danger with the
surgeon is not that he goes out of
fashion but that he can go off quickly,
physically I mean. A physician has the
advantage of him there. Macquarie
Street’s oldest practising surgeon is in
his seventies, and its oldest practising
physician is 90. Both are still good but
you can see a significant discrepancy in
their ages. Quite simply a surgeon must
remain something of an athlete as I said
before.
When should a surgeon give up?
When indeed? That’s a tough ques-
tion. Because of vanity and egotism
many surgeons keep on long after they
should have retired. Many years ago I
knew a surgeon of great eminence in
this country, a man whose friendship I
greatly valued, who had got to the
stage where he was making serious, even
dangerous, mistakes. I eventually re-
fused to refer any patients of mine to
him.
Did he know that?
Never.
When will you give up?
As soon as I feel I’m losing ground
in my surgery. And if I haven't the
nous to know when I’ve reached that
stage I hope someone will have the sense
to tell me."

SHORT STORY BY BERNARD COYLE
ON their way to the Executive
Council meeting, the first since
Raddle's death, the ten surviving
ing members came to the Great Hall of
the Museum of Art and History to see
their old leader. Simms and O'Shea went
together. Crowds, lined up in Adminis-
trative Square to view Raddle, clapped
on their way upstairs, the radio having
counselled all mourners that cheering
during the obsequies would be unseemly.
The roar of clapping from the thousands
below him was, to O'Shea, as awesome as
a whole forest raving and flailing under
transforming winds, and in the putty-
colored faces raised to the facade of the
Museum, he saw sanity, ultimate justify-
ing sanity.
Raddle, eviscerated to good effect and
stuffed with sweet preservatives, was the
Raddle of twenty years ago—the rubi-
cund and fulsome lines of his recent
face having been smelted down by
death or the cosmetician to the crisper,
more brittle face which was that of the
historic Raddle at his peak.
“Is it really Raddle?” Simms asked.
“He doesn't smell right to me.”
“It's Raddle,” O'Shea decided. “No
more piles problems for him.”
They stood to attention and did re-
verence. After two minutes of silent
standing on the deep lambswool mat
which bore Raddle's coffin like a funeral
raft bearing a bier, they were approached
by the major of honor guard of marines.
“Your car is waiting at the back.”
In place of the people’s treasures which
normally stood there, there were lantern-
jawed marines in the naked hall. As
Simms and O'Shea strode away the
marble of the floor rang beneath their
feet like a muted bell; but Major Nicklen
and Captain Ross, their police aides,
moved in utter silence behind them.
Beyond the cedar doors of the gallery,
Dr Rankin, the curator, was waiting to
shake their hands.
Simms smiled. “You've certainly
worked hard, Rankin, getting the place
ready.”
“Thank you, sir.”
Rankin led them to the back entrance.
Within their overcoats, they stiffened
against the cold. Eucalypts and poplars
fanned the air and on a remote mountain
in the Alps, shining snowdrifts drew the
eye.
“For the first time in 30 years,” Simms
murmured from his corner of the car,
“I’ve had a holiday. Four days during
which the world and Seddon and Shaw
stood still in mourning. It’s been enjoy-
able.”
“I’ve used it as a recess too,” O’Shea
said. He had an honest baker’s face.
“Matter evolves, however, and we’ll soon
know whether we go out the window or
not.”
“I’d go first,” Simms assured his
friend, “and you’d have a week or so
after me. How would you spend it?”
“Lobbying, Hopelessly lobbying. Until
the Assembly actually votes for your
trial. Then I’ll have my last holiday. I'm
content, whichever way it goes. Which-
ever way it goes we've got a few busy
days ahead of us.”
In front of the car, the squad of cycle
policemen bent into the wind, obviously
riding against it, modifying their balance
to its erratic will.
“It'd be a good day for sprinkling
ashes,” O'Shea said. “Of course if the
day goes properly for us, we'll finish em-
balmed, like dear old Raddle.”
The autumn sun lay on his lap like
a tawny cat. He wished they could drive
on for hours with their bald heads thrust
back against the plush and their knees
warm. But it was barely a mile and a
half to old Party Hall, with its flock of
silver lakes around its flanks, trembling
in the wind. By five to eleven they were
there, Simms looking up to the third
floor where Shaw, Chief of the Organ,
might now be reading a letter, a political
behest from the dead Raddle.
Their limousine swept down an avenue
of paratroopers who blithely presented
arms to it. In the foyer, Ed Fallon, Presi-
dent of the Assembly, ex-officio chair-
man of the Executive Council, flanked
by the two black-gowned secretaries,
waited to greet them into Council.
“Is it the Crown Princes we see com-
ing?” Ed asked his two secretaries who
allowed themselves a faint dry titter.
“If it is, you’ll know all about it,”
Simms promised.
The chairman looked at his watch.
Raddle’s death and the engrossing issues
of the interregnum had raised fiesta in
his heart. “Nearly 11. God knows the
truth but waits. He waits in an office on
the third floor and his other name is
Shaw.”
“Anyone else arrived yet?” O’Shea
asked.
“Only Hopkins and poor old Fitz.
They’re eating cashews and drinking beer
over in the ante-room. Would you like
to join them?”
Fallon nodded to a black-and-gilt
official who led Simms and O'Shea down
the main corridor where every door had
its fine paratrooper.
The ante-room was equipped with an
excellent bar, behind which Hopkins was
shooting a glass full of beer for Fitz-
gerald. It was typical of the two of them
to be there first; old Fitzgerald politically
mellow, ready for death, far too depleted
to take part in the lethal shufflings which
would begin in the Council this very
day; and Hopkins, complexioned like a
leech, livid with booze, quite impure poli-
tically, visibly demoralised, and without
a portfolio for the last three years.
“Good morning, gentlemen,” Hopkins
called. “Would you like the chief soak
of the Executive Council to pour you a
nice glass of piss?”
Fitzgerald laughed. He snatched up
a peanut from a dish with the urgent
jerkiness of a parrot, lifted his glass to
the new arrivals and took a prodigious
mouthful of beer.
“You could pour us a glass,” Simms
nodded. “It may be your last chance to
do something for us.”
“You can't tell us, Derrick,” Fitz-
gerald called. “Old Derrick can't tell us.
Just scatter my ashes from the top of
Mangrove bridge, lad. And pour in a
few thousand gallons of ale to wash me
down to the sea.”
“Don’t worry, Fitz, old friend,” O'Shea
smiled. “We may be doing that little trip
together.”
Mighty little Seddon, Raddle’s Minis-
ter of the Interior, arrived with his two
young satellites, Hartley and Chamber-
lain. Then, dark, tense and refusing
drinks, Ferguson pounded in and filled
in the time having a hit of billiards by
himself. Finally, Darcy and Martens
came in, talking together. Ten men who,
living a few idle minutes on the rim of
the crucible, were, throughout the whole
nation, the men most in peril.
They were allowed to drink there for
another five minutes, and then an official

knocked on the door. It was time to leave
the ante-room, senior men first. Fitzgerald
limped through the door, behind him
Darcy and Ferguson. Then, visibly
making a ritual farewell to the bar by
the way he laid his glass down, mopped
up slowly and put away the beer-gun,
Hopkins went. Then Simms and O’Shea,
Seddon and Martens, Hartley and
Chamberlain.
Ed Fallon and his two secretaries led
them down the corridor, and the end of
the procession was a special squad of
parliamentary police who would guard
the door of the Council Chamber.
“Before we begin,” Fallon said loudly,
above the noise of sitting Councillors,
“we’d better have a minute’s silence.”
Throughout the minute, Simms
watched Seddon, an Italianate young man
with thick black hair and perfectly
harmonious features. Seddon glared
across the silent chamber, as bald and
monumental as a bronze condottiere, at
one with the present and unconquerably
self-confident about the future.
Executive Council meetings, being
secret, could be carried on without a
finicking regard for the classic forms of
the parliamentary meeting. All that the
people knew of the work of this conclave
was the final draft of some of the deci-
sions taken here. For this meeting was,
in fact, a Cabinet meeting, each of the
10 except Hopkins having held a port-
folio under Raddle; and Cabinet minis-
ters who were not in the Council were
able to contact it only through Raddle
himself—the great man thus making him-
self both apex and hub.
Fallon coughed. The Council aban-
doned silence. The First Secretary be-
gan to read in plain chant the proceed-
ings of the last meeting and the decisions
taken therein. The 10 voted on a pro-
vision about the appointment of district
agricultural officers, on a Citrus Fruits
and a Rice Committee to present reports
in view of proposed trade agreements with
Italy, on new minimum requirements for
the executive of workers’ committees,
and on military manoeuvres for the
central coast.
Darcy rose then as Minister of Agricul-
ture, and began to speak about “dummy-
ing” on the part of farmers in the south-
ern districts. He explained how affluent
farmers had lent money so extensively in
the areas where gambling was rife that,
with the fall in world food prices and
the imposition by Raddle of the low flat
rate on all produce, their debtors tried
to pay off hopeless debts by virtually
alienating land to them.
Seddon began to tell the Council of
the apostasy of the Second Secretary in
the Legation in Ottawa. As a result of
his failure, two scientists from the Canad-
ian Institute of Nuclear Research had
been indicted for treason.
It was close to noon, and questions on
Canadian espionage drifted about the
room like pieces of leisurely jetsam. None
of the Councillors wished to be the one
to let the subject die, and to precipitate
the fraught moment when Shaw would
be called into Council.
At last Fallon cut across the shambling
discussion.
“If we could put this business aside,
Colonel Shaw wants to be admitted. The
motion to let him in here has to come
from one of you.”
The Councillors stared stupidly at their
hazed images in the Council table.
Neither Seddon, Simms nor Ferguson
would ever propose the motion.
“All right,” old Fitzgerald grunted. “I
move it. I move that the Chief of the
Organ be admitted to the Council Cham-
ber to advise us on important
matters.”
“Seconded,” Hopkins called, eager for
damnation.
“Anyone to speak?” Fallon asked.
No one raised a hand. O'Shea turned
his eyes along the table. Unable to see
Ferguson for the welter of faces and
parts of faces which interposed them-
selves, O'Shea knew exactly the look of
the man at this moment, a pale bunched
brow and beneath it cheeks and jaw and
neck all livid with excitement.
Simms was leaning far out on the table,
showing to junior Councillors the speck-
led band of broken flesh running across
the back of his neck, where he had been
shot by a demented trade union organ-
iser over 30 years before.
Beside O’Shea was Seddon, his arms
folded tightly like those of a little boy
in a football group. He emitted a flavor
of unbeatable mastery, so that at this
flat table, in a theoretically equal condi-
tion with every other Councillor, he still
seemed the top of some pyramid of
authority and dignity. Like volume and
mass, truth and love, education and
sanity, the image of Seddon and the
image of Shaw were to O’Shea two
complementary principles.
There was no God. Matter evolving
was God. And the highest form of matter
evolving was the Party, and the highest
form of the Party was nominally the
Executive Council. In fact, the supreme
form of the Party, matter, or God had
been until last Wednesday Raddle, and
Shaw at Raddle’s elbow and ear, Shaw
whispering to the only man to whom the
pervasive Secret Police ultimately repor-
ted, the only man in any way exempt
from Organ scrutiny.
On last Wednesday, God had stirred.
Raddle had begun haemorrhaging in the
afternoon. Before dinner-time he had
died.
The Organ was a peculiar Party body,
a creator of Party truth, bringing out of
nothing the facts on which many of
O’Shea’s old friends had gone down to
death. It was unanswerable wisdom. In
its stablest form it served one man, and
provoked the swift evolution of matter
since the old man did not have to face
harmful political opposition.
“We'll put it to the vote,” Fallon said.
“All those in favor that, . . . (the

Sfecond Secretary handed Fallon a flimsy)
“that the Chief of the Organ, etc.”
There was a series of Ayes; some meant
to be weary, others meant to be blithe,
yet all identical in the end. Ten slovenly
hands rose in the air.
“That absolves me,” Fallon smiled,
“from casting a deciding vote.”
He plucked up the house telephone.
“Col. Shaw, please.” As he waited, he
surveyed wryly the string of bluffing
elders slumped along the table, all their
hearts quivering and their stomachs con-
vulsed.
“Hullo, Colonel. You may come down
now.”
They waited on for Shaw while the
secretaries went and opened both leaves
of the door. Some didn’t stir, others sat
like men who had forgotten speeches, in-
dulging many furtive mannerisms to plug
up the gap of silence. Then through the
doorway came the row of Shaw slom-
mocking down the stairs like a school-
boy. He was small, so small that even the
few hints of plumpness about him seemed
inordinate; he was very bald and very
brown, as if the hair had been singed off
his head by the same excess of sun that
had leathered up his face.
No one stood for the entry of the Chief
of Secret Police, for he was the servant
of the Executive Council. Fallon
motioned him to the small padded bench
beside the chairman's seat.
“Councillors,” Fallon intoned. “I pre-
sent to you Colonel Shaw.’’
The clerkly midget rose.
“Mr President and Councillors. I want
to assure you of my organisation's con-
tinued assistance to the Executive Coun-
cil. It is the child of the Executive Coun-
cil and could not exist without it. It
exists for your use. Its history proves its
value, for 35 years ago it was a branch
of the Army and consisted of four or five
Army officers. Now it is an institution
of tremendous extent, whose limits no
one knows perhaps not even I. It has
grown because it nurtures no private am-
bitions, but labors for the Executive
Council. And it is not going to reverse
this fruitful policy. I offer cur help to all
of you and urge you to take it.”
From his bench. Shaw began to wander
down that side of the table which was
unpeopled except for the two secretaries.
“There’s naturally a hiatus in our work
as the result of the great Raddle’s death.
You will find that Party security is still
the alpha and omega of our existence.”
He continued, doubling and re-doub-
ling his message, doodling with words.
Out of his repetitions would come at any
second a sign of election. When it did,
it seemed unrehearsed and unsubtle.
The little man came back to the centre
of the table. “Excuse me,” he said to the
Second Secretary, and leaning so far
across the table that his pudgy upper
body lay almost flat along its surface, he
extended his hand unmistakably to
Simms.
“Good afternoon, Mr Simms. You
look fine. Many a year left on the Exe-
cutive Council for you yet.”
“Perhaps, Colonel.”
“I’m sure of it. Could I have an inter-
view with you later?”
Without sign of disbelief or disap-
pointment, Seddon gazed across the table
at Shaw's robust face. Many of the
Councillors were glad, if not for Simms’s
success then for the discomfiture of the
wonderboy. O’Shea sat quietly, absolved
from the weight of death, from lumping
its close certainty about with him day by
day and from bearing soon a weight of
grave earth on his brow and chest and
stomach, which would be inanimate in
death but which were, in any case, his
brow and chest and stomach.
Shaw stood upright again. He said,
“Mr Chairman, gentlemen, excuse me,”
and made for the door.
At the top of the table old Fitz began
to clap.
“Damn good choice,” he called.
“Damn good choice.” The clapping
bounced off Shaw’s back. He refused
to advert to it.
“Order,” Fallon mumbled urgently.
“Come on.” He tugged at old Fitz's
shoulder. “Fair go, Fitz,” he hissed.
But the old man was engrossed in
cheerful applause.
T>ehind the perfect curve of the wall,
cosseted dam waters were set as
neatly as a jelly in a bowl. Terraces de-
scended half-way down the valley-side
and vanished into a jungle of rugged
sand-stone flora, clearly intended to act
as a barrier against children who intend
to fall into catchment areas. It was
scarcely a challenge to O'Shea’s grand-
children, squealing thei.' way down to
the shore under the eye of O'Shea's son,
their parent.
On the highest terrace, on a lawn mot-
leyed with shade from perennials, O'Shea
and his wife sat on camp-stools and
gazed at the stunning inertia of piled-up
waters. Mrs O’Shea was an intense lover
of natural beauty, but her ardors were
never articulate enough to interest her
husband. O’Shea had commenced his
improbable association with this lady be-
fore the Revolution. On a holiday
ordered and paid for by the Party, he
had met her at a fishing place far up the
coast, where her father owned a launch.
At that time she had been very slim. He
still remembered how perfect her limbs
were, with a promise of eternal perfec-
tion about them. She had wide, dark eyes,
a classic long nose, and something of a
lantern jaw, which now made her ludi-
crous when she had her dentures out.
Simms had told him to marry a Party
lady rather than a moronic country girl
whose chief virtue was her malleability.
But O'Shea found her obtuseness not
merely endearing but even ravishing.
Mrs O’Shea had survived the years of
struggle with simple loyalty, not to the
Party and Party doctrine, but to O'Shea.
“This is the finest dam I know,” she
said. “How much did you say it held,
dear?”
“Only about 60 billion gallons.”
“Only about 60 billions!”

We would need 120 tons of ice on a summer day to
cool the twelve floors of 505 St. Kilda Road. But it
takes just 35 Chrysler 5 H.P. and 8 H.P. Packaged
Units to do the job.
The advantages of placing a number of packaged units
throughout the building are that each floor may be
regulated to a mean temperature chosen by the
occupants of each floor —and a service call for what-
ever reason does not interrupt the continuity of cooling
or heating for other people in the building.
Your Airteinp Distributor will show you, for instance,
the job we’ve done for Kodak in Perth, Hotel Australis
in Adelaide, Peak Frean in Sydney and Camden Home
Units in Brisbane. Or he'll take you into offices,
restaurants, council chambers, R.S.L. clubs and
hospitals or private homes that are better places to
work and live in. This is because they are air
conditioned by Chrysler.
Walter P. Chrysler of automobile fame pioneered tho

“Yes. Don't sound amazed. That’s only
small as dams go.”
She looked over her shoulder to see if
Ross was still standing near the Picnic
Reserve gate, but he must have been off
somewhere in the shade of the trees.
“That Captain Ross and his friends,”
she grunted. “I wish they'd either stay
at home or join in the fun. How can we
have a lively picnic with them moping
about? It’s worse than having guardian
angels.”
O’Shea smiled faintly. “Perhaps you’d
have liked it better if you’d married
some fisherman from Smoky Cape. Per-
haps you don't like being so important
that the Organ has to hover around you.”
“I’ve got no regrets,” she shrugged.
“Not one.”
O'Shea, in an open shirt with the
breeze stirring the hairs of his consequen-
tial chest, was drinking a placid can of
beer, direct from the can, as if he were a
boilermaker on holidays.
“Oh,” his wife said,” I couldn’t ask
you about Seddon last night. I fell asleep
waiting for you. Why was he put on
trial?”
“Basically for warmongering,” O’Shea
said simply. “He's far too militant. He’s
militant at any cost. Simms found out
that he’s been in constant private corres-
pondence with a lot of our diplomats.
He’s been behind the encouraging of a
fair amount of direct sabotage all over
the world. For instance, that generator
explosion in Holland. Obviously sabo-
tage; and the Dutch know as well as I do
that ultimately it was Seddon behind it.
His methods have become so clumsy and
patent that I fail to understand him any-
more. And now, this Indonesian business,
Seddon was very insulting to Simms over
that.”
“He asked to be shot. Raddle would
have shot him. And yet Simms puts him
in charge of a . . . What is it he’s going to
run?”
“An Agricultural Research Station.”
“Yes, Raddle would have shot him.”
O’Shea considered his beer can. “Simms
considers Seddon's personality. Seddon
has been popular. Simms might want to
impress people with the mercy of the
regime. He might be offering a chance
of rehabilitation to Seddon.”
Mrs O'Shea shook her bead. “I don’t
know! I’m not brutal. But if a man says
he’s guilty and demands to be shot for
his crimes ....!”
“He meant it. Life on those God-for-
saken western plains is a far worse pen-
ance than death for a man like Seddon.”
“Well,” she said blithely. “If Com-
munism is the truth, I suppose that’s the
only way to run things.”
O’Shea smiled. “You know, you’re a
wise old bird. When I was in the Lega-
tion in Paris, a newspaper man said
to me, quite seriously, ‘You people
won't last long. Your leaders are already
killing each other.’ It was the time of
Dowd's purges, you know. These demo-
crats are so naive. They think that when
Seddon begs to be shot for his crimes,
he's under the influence of some drug.
Yet, the people they believe in . . .! It
beats me!”
She stood up, pulled her cardigan
from the back of the chair and began
putting it on.
“I'd be a bit worried about you if you
weren't such a good friend of Simms.”
“Well,” he said, in mild but real an-
noyance, “it's no use explaining to you
how friendship can have little to do
with it. Just the same, you don’t have
to fret over me. Someone said — I think
it was Hartley — that under the old
system I would have made a good,
plodding suburban alderman. He meant
it as an insult. He didn't know me when
I was superintendent of the North Coast.
However, suburban aldermen die at home
of coronary occlusion or ruptured
ulcers.”
“Stop it,” said Mrs O'Shea.
“Damn me. Here they come,” groaned
O'Shea. “Anyway, it's time to go.”
His three grandchildren came gallop-
ing up the steps. From amongst the
syrup-colored poplars, Ross appeared
and glided towards the cars. O'Shea and
his. wife folded up the camp-stools. A
cooling sun had moored itself to the rim
of the mountain above them; and their
son came up to them and said, “Almost
time to go, isn’t it?”
“I suppose so,” said O'Shea.
O'Shea, as Communications Minister,
sat by Simms on the day the leader
opened the new Telecommunication
Centre by a mere telephone call to
Bangkok. When the dignitaries had been
ushered out of the building, and milled
for a little while in the damp sunlight,
Simms invited O'Shea to ride home with
him, since it was a day of considerable
triumph for the Communications Minis-
ter.
“It’s quite a day for you,” Simms
said warmly.
“Yes.”
“You don’t sound as if you believe
that.”
“I do. Except that I have a favor to
ask and I don’t know whether you’ll
misunderstand me or not.”
“Haven't you known me long
enough?”
O’Shea conceded this by hitching his
shoulders.
“All right,” he said. “This is it. I know
that no one has ever retired from the
Executive Council the way a carpenter
or a butcher retires. But, I want to do
that. To retire, normally and naturally.
I’ve given my all for the Party, and now
I’d like to sit on a beach in the sun, with
my old moll talking rot beside me. I
don’t think I’ll be as much use to the
Council from now on as many a younger
man would be.”
Simms pulled at the lobe of his ear.
“Look,” he grunted. “Have you thought
about this? Do you really want to
retire?”
“Yes. I’m sure. I could get a doctor’s
certificate to confirm the wisdom of re-
tiring.”
“Huh!” Simms wriggled in his seat.
“We could all get doctor’s certificates to
say we shouldn’t battle on. Some of
us could get them psychiatrists.”
The leader thought on, sucking at a
hollow tooth he had since O'Shea first
knew him.
“It’s such a stinking bad example,” he
growled.
“Look, you can tell the people I
couldn’t work on for health reasons. You
can surely think of some incapacitating
disease to give me.”
“It’d be dangerous for you to retire.
I mean, Shaw might have you investi-
gated.”
“I can risk that. Can I retire?”
The Premier sucked dubiously.
“Oh, hell! I suppose we can rig it.”
Above the almost non-existent hum of
their limousine, the rain travelled on a
high wind and pecked at the window.
O’Shea knew a beach far up the coast
where the weather was always tempe-
rate and bream crowded in the fishing
holes. He had a lease on land there, and
had built a bungalow scarcely a hundred
yards from the beach.
Usually he rose for the tides or stayed
up for them. Mrs O'Shea found some
serene enjoyment in tending their bun-
galow, yet she spent hours on the beach,
watching. O'Shea fished until the sun,
lolling above the ridges behind their
head, could no longer take the chill out
of the wind.
The retired Councillor fished the
weeks away with a quiet consistent pas-
sion. One night in early December, for
example, he covered himself with mos-
quito repellent and shuffled down to the
beach with his gear. There were a few
lights at well-known fishing holes up and
down the beach, but he had for his own
use a mile of pure sand, dark surf, and
fish who never rested from hunger. He
lit a fire high up on the beach and,
his hands orange in the fire-light, baited
up with blood-worm.
He scarcely had time to hope before
a fish struck. It was like that at every
cast and he spilt out far more time in
baiting than in actually taking the fish.
In the end, when he looked at his watch,
he found that it was after midnight and
that he was far too tired to clean his
catch. He washed them in the surf, put
them into plastic bags, kicked the dead

fire over, and sprinkled it with sand.
With the surf forgotten, and his mind
on soft unaspiring rest, he struggled
away through the desiccated sand-dunes.
Layers of sleep descended on him. He
slept richly, like an ear of grain done up
in its warm husks. The tide changed a
few hundred yards away from his
window, and began to change again. Into
the sky came a reflection of dawn a few
meridians away. The night turned dimly
luminous. Trawlers jerked up the estuary
and wavered towards open sea.
A blue truck hummed in quiet, un-
impeded third gear through the streets,
looking for Pacific Avenue and O’Shea’s
green bungalow.
The O’Shea’s doorbell rang in chimes.
If you jabbed the button again and
again, as children always did, you caused
a riotous and accelerating pattern of
notes, such as woke Mrs O'Shea at four
o’clock. When she saw the light blue
uniform of the Organ Liaison Branch on
the three men at the door, she squealed
and it was this noise which brought
O’Shea himself fully awake.
He sat up in the warm bed and two
Organ men came through the door and
looked at his early morning ugliness with
distaste. One had a repeating rifle over
his shoulder and the other had a revolver
in his hand.
“You’d better get some decent clothes
on,” the Organ man with the revolver
said. Mrs O’Shea wept hopelessly in the
corridor. O'Shea opened the cabinet and
took out a clean shirt.
the drugged processes of
Communist redemption, he had no
time to himself to think on his life,
to find its motif or its formula. He
shared a cell with a former public ser-
vant who was on the edge of re-conver-
sion and who sweated with proselytizing
fervor for the ex-Councillor’s political
sanity. The loud-speakers in the roof of
his cell were meant to remake his soul,
they tugged and wheedled him from
truth to truth. In the re-education group
in which he worked he was constantly
abused as a lazy bourgeois because he
lacked ardor to express the truth that
was in him. “Which must be in you,”
the leader of the group, a middle-aged
lawyer, would scream, “since you used
to be a Councillor.”
The whole group would then cry,
“You used to be a Councillor! You filthy
bastard! You gob of shit!”
He was the body of their sin and they
couldn’t look at him without frenzy.
With the old bread which came in twice
a day, O’Shea and the public servant
were given baked beans in the morning
and a variety of things rice, bananas
when there was a glut, a few green
tomatoes at night. In the evenings,
two orderlies bore in the sanitary can on
a wooden platform with handles. The

two bearers would stay in the cell to
talk about O’Shea’s nakedness while the
poor government man knelt down and
scuttered around the can, chalking bands
of manifestos on it for the men in the
next cell.
O’Shea surmised that he had a few
weeks of life left. It sped away from him
with the indistinctness of a train wailing
down a night cutting. He was a man
watching carriages go past, each window
spraying his face with the same cold
light, and nowhere in that whole feature-
less length anything, a rail or a handle,
to lay his hand on.
Until, two days before he was shot*
Simms came to say good-bye. O’Shea
was marched to the warden’s office and
felt its thick green carpet distractingly
comfortable beneath his feet. Simms
alone was there, standing near the
warden’s chair, against a background of
three smiling group photographs of
Army officers.
“How’re things, O’Shea?” Simms
asked with considerable warmth.
“Not bad. A nice bit of happy execu-
tion would do me the world of good
now.”
Simms nodded. “The routine of a
political prison must seem clumsy to a
man like you. You’re a believer in any
case, aren’t you?”
“Yes,” O'Shea sighed. “I suppose it’s
no use denying that.”
Simms was overtaken by sudden an-
noyance.
“Why in the hell did you want to
retire? The very act of retiring put Shaw
onto you, and I warned you that circum-
stances might make me unable or un-
willing to help you. Shaw believes that
anyone who wants to retire from the
Executive Council must be a political
criminal. Of course, I’m not so sure I
don’t agree with him.”
“Don’t worry.” O’Shea smiled, like a
man whose weekend meat has not been
delivered yet who is gracious about it,
“I had a marvellous retirement. After a
week I said to myself, ‘lf I w'ere arrested
tonight, I'd be still satisfied’.”
Simms rocked his head in exaspera-
tion. “If it was only a holiday you
wanted . . .!”
“No. A holiday wasn’t enough.
Neither for the old girl nor for me. I
wanted to be able to cast a line into
the sea and say, ‘No more Executive
Council for me’.”
Simms turned his back on O'Shea and
looked at his reflection in the glass of
one of the photographs.
“For a man of your temperament,” he
said, “you have worked well for the
Party. You got to the top rung by pure
integrity and guts-power. A lot of people
would say you didn't deserve this. But
we know that being a Communist isn’t
a matter of deserts or otherwise. The
logic of development very often kills the
best Communists. I hope you don’t think
I’m responsible ultimately for your ar-
rest. When all the evidence had been
considered and when seven members of
the General Assembly applied for retire-
ment, I chose to give my assent to your
trial, but it was Shaw who began to
hunt for you.”
“You don’t have to give any explana-
tion.”
“Let me talk. Shaw brought me evi-
dence of all sorts of corruption in your
department some junior inspectors
who turned tours of inspection into
fishing trips, a few senior public servants
who were using the finances and material
of the department in subtle ways. I know
he could have found this sort of thing
in any department. Then he went back
over 30 or 40 years, looking for any
speeches, incidents, meetings with
foreign diplomats, anything that could
be interpreted in line with your guilt.
And so, here we are.”
“I told you you don’t have to explain,”
O’Shea said. “I’m not a Communist’s
boot-lace if I can’t accept the Party dis-
cipline without moaning. You had to
bring me to trial.”
“Friendship in the old sense is a
crippling burden these days.”
“Just now,” O'Shea said firmly, “the
highest form of love is the purge. In the
slaughter of a hundred unsuitables like
myself, there’s love for unborn millions.”
“It’s my upbringing. All the foggy
relative ideas of love and friendship I
was fed; the child is father of the man
and so on.”
“If you’re a friend,” said O’Shea, “all
I want is that my wife shouldn’t be
touched. She won’t cause you trouble.
In a few years she’ll die with a modicum
of peace in my son’s home. Can you
leave her alone till then?”
“I promise you. She’ll be left alone.”
“Thank you.”
The door opened and a far-away
babble of truth from the speakers in
each cell throbbed around the walls of
the office. O'Shea was taken away. With
a small, throaty hiccough the door
closed.
Simms took up the telephone.
“Colonel Shaw, please.”
“Hullo, Colonel. I’ve just seen O’Shea.
I’ve made a decision. I think we’d better
put his wife in a re-education institution.
Not that she was ever educated in the
first place. She’s unrepentantly bourgeois.
She’s staying with her son. You know,
the lawyer. You have the address.”
He said good-bye to the warden and
was conducted down to the car. In the
street, in the few seconds before Nicklen
hustled him into the car, he saw the sky
ruddy with wind as it had been a year
before, when Raddle died. In the grey
flats across the road, large fertile women
filled the windows, knowing by the car
and four motor-cycle policemen that
someone of moment was within the
prison. They waved and cheered when
he came out. They held their babies’
arms and waved them like flags at the
national father. From the window he
watched them, knowing that there was
a meaning to their living in slums,
cooking on a squalid gas-ring, eating
old bread, catching colds from the
damps of the walls, turning off the
light at night merely to blot out the
prolific junk of family life which made
the room ugly, and begetting children
in rooms already crowded with heavy-
breathing children.
“Not long now, my children,” he
grunted. “Not long now.”
In the wide avenues, the sun had room
to spread its shoulders. With its light on
his artless face, the father of all the
people slept in the warm corner of his
car. ,

OVERSEAS
Their Man in Canberra
Lim Yew Hock Malaysia’s new envoy
from ALEX JOSEY in Singapore
Tun Lim Yew Hock (Tun is
Malay title, higher than a Dato,
probably equal to a barony, which
was bestowed upon him by the Yang di
Pertuan Agong in 1958) is a third
generation Malayan Chinese of Hokkien
stock. He was born in Singapore on
October 15, 1914, and, like Singapore’s
Prime Minister, and half the Cabinet,
attended Raffles Institution. He started
his schooling in a Chinese school, but
there his formal education ended. He
had to look for a job: but this was the
period of depression, the Hungry
’Thirties, and for three years Lim Yew
Hock knew the misery of unemployment.
But he was not idle. He learned short-
hand and typing, and in 1934 he was
working in the Singapore office of
Imperial Chemical Industries as a clerk.
He was still a clerk when the Japanese
marched in. After the war, Singapore
went through a period of intense trade
union activity, and Lim Yew Hock left
his job with the Singapore Cold Storage
to become the full-time general secretary
of the Clerical and Administrative
Workers’ Union. He did not realise it
then, but this was his first step towards
a political career which eventually was
to occupy 15 years of his life.
Lim Yew Hock’s energy and enthusi-
asm, and his distrust of Communist
agitators in the Singapore trade union
movement, soon came to the notice of
the authorities, and in 1947 he was
selected by the British Council to go to
England to study modern democratic
trade union methods. He came back a
socialist, and an organiser of industrial
unions. Later he helped to found the
Singapore Trade Union Congress, and
became the president. But this organisa-
tion, like so many others, political and
trade union, with which Tun Lim was
associated, collapsed after a while.
Singapore was a colony going through
a difficult period of development, in
which Nationalists, Communists and
opportunists clashed with colonial in-
terests. Political parties and trade unions
sprang up and disappeared with equal
suddenness but Lim Yew Hock con-
tinued to remain in the public eye as a
workers’ man.
In 1948 Lim attended the Asian
Regional Conference of the International
Labor Office, in New Delhi. That was
the year when 34-year-old Lim became
a politician. He became a nominated
Member of Singapore’s first Legislative
Council. In 1951 he contested one of
the twelve elected seats in the 25-member
Council, and secured the highest number
of votes of any candidate. He was then
a member of the Progressive Party, now
no more.
In 1955 Lim Yew Hock fought for
one of the 25 elected seats in the 32-
member Assembly. Again, he polled
more votes than anyone else. By now
he was the driving force in the Labor
Party, which was part of the Labor
Front, and he accepted David Marshall’s
invitation to become Minister for Labor
in Marshall’s short - lived government.
Marshall resigned after 14 months in
office following the collapse of con-
stitutional talks in London. Later, Mar-
shall accused Lee Kuan Yew, a member
of the all-party delegation, of stabbing
him in the back when he tried to re-
open the talks. Marshall also com-
plained that Lim Yew Hock failed to
support him in London.
On June 8, 1956, Lim Yew Hock, the
ex-shorthand typist, became the Chief
Minister. He then had two fierce
political opponents to contend with:
David Marshall, a bitter and often con-
temptuous enemy, and the argumentative
and legalistic Lee Kuan Yew. Marshall
had hoped that the Labor Front would
resign with him: he had said as much
in London. He hoped the Front would
be ready to fight fresh elections. In-
stead, Lim Yew Hock took his place as
Chief Minister, and headed another all-
party delegation to London in 1957, to
reach agreement on principle, and again
in 1958 to sort out the constitutional
details. On each occasion, Lee Kuapi
Yew went with him.
Tun Lim Yew Hock can, therefore,
justly claim to have played a leading and
important part in achieving self-govern-
ment for_Singapore. He did much more,
though he never knew it at the time. He
also prepared the way for the emergence
of the well-organised, disciplined, ruth-
less People’s Action Party waiting in the
wings to dominate the political scene
once elections for Singapore’s first fully
elected government were held in 1959.
Tun Lim had not failed to recognise
the danger, and in 1958 he set up a new
party, the Singapore People’s Alliance,
which, he hoped, would become a broad
united front of all parties opposing the
People’s Action Party, which then
included a number of extremists in its
ranks. Tun Lim’s efforts failed. Revo-
lution was in the air, and Tun Lim’s
government was swept aside, the PAP
winning 43 of the 51 seats. Tun Lim
survived, and he became Leader of the

Opposition. His party won four seats.
An eve of poll sensational disclosure
that his party had received $500,000
from American sources as a fighting
fund did nothing to help his cause during
the elections.
Lim did not contest the 1963 elections
in which all the Alliance candidates
were defeated. He put out a statement
saying he had decided not to stand for
office following w'hat he called the
PAP’s smear campaign against him. He
said that this had gone beyond the
bounds of decency, and he instructed his
solicitors to take legal action against the
People's Action Party to clear his name.
No action was ever brought to the
courts. Clashes in the Assembly be-
tween the Prime Minister and Tun Lim
Yew Hock had been getting progressively
more bitter and personal, and, at the
final session of the old Assembly, angry
words were exchanged. Tun Lim was
highly critical of the Prime Minister's
handling of the discontent among the
Harbor Board's 10,000 workers, to
whom Mr Lee had unexpectedly given
a $2 million bonus. Mr Lee retorted
that the workers would have got this
$2 million two years earlier if the sec-
retary of the Harbor Board Workers’
Union “had not played the Communist
game” and ended up in jail.
Tun Lim resigns
IT was a particularly acrimonious debate
and some hard things were said.
There is no doubt that this clash must
have hastened the end of Tun Lim’s
active political career. His position had
been weakening for some time. No
longer was he Leader of the Opposition,
a job taken over by Dr Lee Siew Choh,
chairman of the pro-Communist group
which broke away from the PAP in
1961. And, in a complex and develop-
ing situation, no longer did Lim com-
mand the full confidence of his own
party. He did not stand for re-election.
And when the votes had been counted,
and an astonished Alliance Party dis-
covered they had been completely
routed, he was blamed for the defeat, and
from all sides came a call for his resigna-
tion as chairman. Lim at once gave up
the post and flew to London for his
son's wedding.
It is perhaps in the nature of things
that ungrateful voters can more easily
remember a politician's defeats, and
errors of judgment, than they can their
triumphs. Tun Lim's passing from the
active political scene went almost un-
noticed; yet Tun Lim can claim his
measure of success as a politician and
as a trade union activist. He has
always believed in merger with Malaya,
and right from the start he strongly
supported Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s efforts
to get the maximum advantage for Singa-

Sometimes it is difficult to get the mess-
age. VENTILATION is one of the less
tangibles and not always too well under-
stood by those who may need it most.
It happens to be our business and maybe
we're more interested, but everybody
wants better air conditions. Usually the
great need is for a controlled forced
draught throughout the whole building
more here, less there not only for
removing stale air, smoke, cooking
odours and so on, but also for replacing
continuously with clean filtered air.
Cooling in summer in winter time the
air-flow rate is cut back to a gentle level

normal room heaters. Thoroughly engin-
eered mechanical ventilation can be a
low-cost answer to most air comfort

pore in Malaysia. For two years Lim
Yew Hock kept the PAP minority
government in office (in his own in-
terests as much as Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s
it may be argued), and he has often
insisted, not without reason, that he
prevented the PAP from being captured
by Communists when in 1957, as Chief
Minister, he ordered the arrest of 35
PAP extremists. Mr Lee has always
protested that the moderates in his party
could have handled the situation had the
Government not interfered. To which,
in my hearing, Tun Lim has remarked:
“I had good excuse then to close down
the PAP. That was what the Security
people wanted me to do. I could easily
have removed my Opposition. I never
entertained the idea for a moment. I
believe in democracy. I gave the PAP
another chance.”
Tun Lim Yew Hock has long been a
personal friend of Tunku Abdul Rah-
man, Malaysia’s Premier, and this
friendship must have contributed to the
eventual merger of Singapore and
Malaya, and the creation of Malaysia.
They are two men with much in
common. Tun Lim is a quiet, unassum-
ing man with a common touch. He is
normally happy, and he has a quick,
friendly smile, and an easy manner: his
eyes glint good-humoredly through his
spectacles. He is a slightly built man, a
pipe-sucker, a good companion, willing
to drink “Yam Sing” (bottoms up) with
the next table, ready to tell a good story,
willing to listen.
I have known Lim Yew Hock almost
from the beginning of his public life.
Many times I have had a bowl of
noodles with him, and a glass of beer,
at a foodstall, sitting on a low stool in
the roadway in busy Chinatown. He
must be one of the best known persons
in the State: he has had long association
with societies and clubs and organisa-
tions. He speaks several Chinese dialects,
and excellent Malay, and is confident in
English. He is informal and approach-
able, and it is not in his nature to be
anything else. He carried the burdens
of high office in the State with ease and
sensible dignity. In the Assembly, as a
speaker and as a personality, he was
no match for Lee Kuan Yew’s brilliance
—who was? But Lim Yew Hock, as
head of the Government, and as
Leader of the Opposition, and, later,
spokesman for his party, often proved to
be a courageous and skilful debater. He
seldom lost his temper, or appeared
ruffled. Unlike David Marshall, Tun
Lim tried hard to avoid personalities in
politics: he struggled to be friendly even
with his bitterest political enemies.
Family man
T ike many Chinese, Tun Lim Yew
Hock is a devoted family man. His
wife and four children (three daughters,
one married, two now with him in Aus-
tralia) have always been an essential
part of his life. He considers himself
fortunate that he has managed to give
his children the sort of education he
would liked to have had himself. His
friends say that Tun Lim Yew Hock is
not a rich man, but has invested what
surplus he had carefully and wisely.
Tun Lim has consistently and ener-
getically opposed Communism, and he
was never able to condone Lee Kuan
Yew’s readiness to collaborate with
extremists of all shades during the PAP’s
nationalistic. battle for freedom from
colonialism. This in spite of the fact
that Lee made it clear that after in-
dependence he would resist anybody
attacking democracy. Tun Lim did not
consider this sufficient reason to associ-
ate with Communists, even briefly.
When he was in office, Tun Lim met the
Communists, in the schools and in the
trade unions, head on, and this method
then did not prove successful. It was not
until Lee Kuan Yew became Prime
Minister that the Communists were out-
manoeuvred, and finally routed, at least
for the time being. Tun Lim’s methods
in tackling the Communist menace may
have been wrong: but nobody could
ever challenge his courage or determina-
tion.
As Ambassador for Malaysia in Aus-
tralia, Tun Lim Yew Hock will be able
to make the fullest use of his personable
qualities. He is energetic, tireless
(though no longer a badminton player
since a serious car accident in 1962
which, for a time, seriously injured the
sight of one eye), approachable, and a
man of the world. He has travelled in
Europe, and knows Japan, and has
visited the United States. He will be a
worthy representative of his country,
and his considerable political experience
will not be a disadvantage to him.
Just before leaving Malaysia for Can-
berra, Tun Lim told reporters he had
three main tasks. They were to con-
solidate Malaysia’s friendship with Aus-
tralia and New Zealand during this
“crucial period of confrontation”. To
enlist wider economic co-operation from
New Zealand and Australia, and, thirdly,
to look after the welfare of some 6000
Malaysian students in Australia.
All this I am personally confident, as
the Tunku must also be, that Tun Lim
Yew Hock will be able to do well and
unostentatiously in formal surroundings,
or circumstances, or informally while
sampling. Australia’s wines or beers, in
appropriate places, sucking between
lips, as always, that briar pipe of his.
Australia will not find it hard to get

The Myth
of the Mafia
The American experience
By DANIEL BELL
IT is a vivid demonstration of the
power of the mass media, the
gullibility of the American audience,
and the deceit of certain public officials
that the phrase Cosa Nostra has passed
so quickly and so uncritically into the
lexicon. Any newspaper reference these
days to a gangster, particularly one w'ith
an Italian name, is almost automatically
prefaced with the statement that he is
a member of the Philadelphia Cosa
Nostra or the Los Angeles Cosa Nostra,
etc. The phrase has almost become
synonymous with organised crime itself.
Yet the hard fact is that there is no
such thing as the Cosa Nostra, at least
not in the sweeping sense in which the
phrase is generally used. Nor is there a
nationwide “syndicate” or “crime cartel”,
such as the Press has identified w'ith the
Cosa Nostra. And as a result of these
misconceptions the complex nature of
organised crime in the United States—
which does exist has been seriously
over-simplified and distorted, thus mak-
ing it much harder to conduct an intelli-
gent fight against it.
The phrase Cosa Nostra comes, of
course, from Joe Valachi, the gravel-
voiced, self - confessed murderer who
appeared on the national television
screens in early October, 1963, while
testifying before the McClellan Com-
mittee. Valachi was a natural. His
mangling of the English language, his
Brooklynese, and the unalloyed casual-
ness with w'hich he told his gory tales,
in contrast with the stiff but credulous
moralising of the Committee Chairman,
delightfully fitted the imagination of an
older generation raised on Nick Carter
and a younger one fed by Eliot Ness.
Hearing Valachi claim that while he
participated in several murders he W'as
not actually present at the shootings,
Senator McClellan asked: “Do you mean
to deny responsibility for these slay-
ings?”
To this suggestion that he w'as seeking
exemption, Valachi replied with simple
astonishment: “No, Senator, I know the
law, I was an accessory before the fact,
during the fact and after the fact. But
you see, Senator, in every profession
there is specialisation. And since I am
a good driver, on every job like that I
handled the wheel.”
But how genuine is Valachi's testi-
mony, and w'hat is the Cosa Nostra ?
What he testified, both in his first-
hand reports of a number of murders
and in his hearsay accounts of the gangs,
is largely true; certainly it checks out
with w'hat is already known to New
York prosecuting officials. What is false
and exaggerated, however, is the picture
drawn by some Justice Department
officials and the McClellan Committee
of the scope of these activities and of
the nature of organised crime.
Valachi began his testimony with a
story about his “initiation” into an Italian
gang in the 19205, a story replete wfith
solemn oaths, the drawing of blood and
the assignment of a “godfather”. There
were a number of such close-knit gangs
among Italian immigrant groups in the
’2os; they were composed of individuals
W'ho had come from a common village
or area, and frequently those who made
up a particular gang had vague family
connections. Some called themselves
“Mafia” in imitation of the Mafia in
Sicily, though a few may have actually
belonged to the Mafia at home.
Occasionally there were vague alliances
between gangs; more often there were
violent rivalries. Among the major
clashes were the ones between the Cala-
brese (who came from the toe of the
Italian mainland) and the Sicilians.
14 months of (murder
TI/fucH remains unclear about those
early days. But what is clear is that
in 1930 there was a murderous war
which ran for 14 months, ending on
September 11, 1931, with the murder of
Maranzano, the last of the so-called
“Moustache Petes”, or the older genera-
tion. Out of this war, Luciano emerged
as the controller of some of the major
rackets in New York. But this was a
fight for control only of the Italian
gangs, and involved largely the opera-
tion of the vice and narcotics rackets.
It did not affect the “industrial rackets”,
which were controlled by the Jewish
gangs under Lepke and Gurrah; the
organised liquor-running under Owney
Madden; the beer distribution under
Dutch Schultz in New York and I.ongy
Zwillman in New Jersey; the gambling
concessions run by Meyer Lansky or
Phil Kastel; the numbers rackets of the
West Side Irish gangs, operated under
the protection of Tammany leader Jimmy
H ines; or the vast bookmaking and slot-
machine enterprises which were coming
under Costello's rule. Nor did it affect,
except indirectly, the multifarious rackets
in Chicago under A 1 Capone, or criminal
enterprises elsewhere.
The end of the w'ar in 1931 marked
the beginning of a “truce” between the
many, many different and decentralised
racketeers and their operations. As
Valachi said about his own gang, the
books were closed in 1931 and were not
reopened until 1954, when Albert Anas-
tasia and Frank Scalise began selling
“memberships” for about $40,000 apiece.
This was one of the charges against them
which led to their murders.
The difficulty in understanding organ-
ised crime in the United States is that
various writers have persistently sought
to picture it as a vast cobweb organised
like the Bolshevik Party (perhaps w'ith
Trotskyite deviations) and run from a
single, centralised source. In the “Satur-
day Evening Post”, a magazine that has
obviously been receiving the co-opera-
tion of at least some Justice Department
officials, Peter Mass begins a sensation-
alistic profile of Joe Valachi with the
statement: “The syndicate’s existence has
been known for half a century under
a variety of names: Mafia, Black Hand,
Unione Siciliane and others. But never
before has a member broken the under-
world code of silence, and never before
has the law had such a revealing insight
into ‘America’s second government’.”
Little more than 10 years ago, the late
Senator Estes Kefauver made an equally
sweeping statement in his ghost-written
book “Crime in America”: “The Mafia
today actually is a secret international
government-within-a-government. It has
an international head in Italy—believed
by United States authorities to be Charles
(Lucky) Luciano . . . The Mafia also has
its Grand Council and its national and
district heads in the countries in which
it operates, including the United States.”
But no serious evidence has ever been
presented for any of these assertions.
Turkus, who prosecuted Murder Inc.,
pointed out in 1951 that the Mafia “has
been virtually extinct for two decades”,
and that its last remnants —or at any
rate those still calling themselves Mafia
—were wiped out in the 1931 purge by
members of the Unione Siciliane. The
use of the Black Hand as a headline-
catching label has an even more erratic
history. In 1910, when Italian immi-
grants were being crudely terrorised by
extortion letters signed with a drawing
of a black hand, the New York Police

Department assigned the case to one of
its officers, a Lieutenant Petrosino.
After detailed investigation, Petrosino
proved that no central Black Hand
organisation even existed. The Black
Hand was a myth, deliberately perpetu-
ated by Neapolitan and Sicilian thugs to
get money from gullible immigrants.
As for the Luciano organisation,
Turkus remarks: “It has become popular
in recent years to ‘expose’ Unione as
the single society ruling all crime in
these United States. The evidence and
recorded history paint a different picture
of the facts. No one who really knows
anything at all about the sharp clannish-
ness of mob bosses with respect to
nationalities and creeds would ever
attempt to attribute to any one group
the control over the whole. Besides, if
one such unit had all crime in this
country under its power, is it not reason-
able to assume that somew'here along
the line, some law agency Federal*
State, country or municipal—w'ould have
tripped it up long before this?”
A phrase catches on
Tn strict fact, there never has been a
true Mafia in the United States. The
myth of the Mafia has been spread for
years by a single agency of the United
States Government, the Bureau of Nar-
cotics, which has had to contend with
a highly organised international racket.
Since Italy was a shipping point for
much of the narcotics arriving in the
US, and once here it w'as handled by
Italian gangsters, the highly imaginative
former Commissioner of the Narcotics
Bureau, Harry Anslinger, proclaimed
that the racket was in the hands of “the
Mafia”. And this concept w'as as-
siduously fed to various journalists until
the phrase caught on to the extent that
one now finds a petty gang war in
Brooklyn of recent years blown up into
a “rift in the Mafia”.
If one accepts the well-documented
history put forward by the Sicilian writer
Giovanni Schiavo in his book “The
Truth About the Mafia” (Vigo Press,
1962), for all practical purposes the
Mafia disappeared in Sicily in 1927
when it was shattered by Mussolini.
According to Schiavo, the Mafia, or the
groups bearing that name, emerged
around 1868 as part of an opposition
to all established government in Sicily.
Under the Mafia’s rules of brotherhood,
only Sicilians could belong which
makes a mystery of the presence of
various Neapolitans or Calabrese in the
so-called Mafia gangs in the United
States. Again according to Schiavo,
there has never been an American Mafia,
or an international Mafia, or even one
in eastern Sicily. There were fraternal
organisations and mutual benefit societies
of Italian immigrants in the United
States, and a number of them fell into
the hands of gangsters. But the XJnione
Siciliane, originally a fraternal benefit
society, had nothing to do with the Sici-
lian Mafia. Nor did Lucky Luciano, A 1
Capone or the various Italian gangsters
who assembled for the famous Appala-
chian meeting in 1957.
What, then, of the Cosa Nostra? Why
is this new myth taken seriously, and
why are responsible men silent? The
Valachi picture of a Grand Council of
organised crime headed by an over-all
boss is untrue and nowhere supported by
serious evidence. Moreover, it is a
picture contradicted privately by a law-
enforcement official with the highest
reputation for probity and integrity.
The phrase Cosa Nostra is the figment
of a public-relations man in government.
When Valachi was being questioned by
the Narcotics Bureau some years ago,
he apparently kept referring to “our
business” or “our thing,” using on these
occasions the Italian phrase for those
words, “cosa nostra ”. If a Harlem nar-
cotics pusher were to appear before a
Senate committee and mumble about
“our thing”, he would be laughed down
in a moment. But to the American
penchant for the exotic-sounding phrase,
no matter how meaningless in its own
tongue, Cosa Nostra seems to conjure
up something strange and sinister. It is
the same merchandising principle applied
by the fur industry many years ago when
it began to sell rabbit to the American
female as lapin.
The reason for the Valachi “spec-
tacular” publicity materia! fed to the
magazines and newspapers; nation-wide
television hearings before a Senate com-
mittee—is that the Justice Department
wanted to dramatise the need for new
legislation and powers which it has
sought for years, notably a Federal bill
to legalise wiretapping.
Is there any organised crime in the
United States? There is, and there are
even occasional efforts to create overlord-
ships, though of limited territories or for
particular rackets. There are also deals,
favors, and accommodations —and fall-
ings-out: The picture, if one wants an
analogy, is more like the Democratic
than the Bolshevik Party.
But even this image distorts the major
changes which have taken place in the
nature of organised racketeering over
the last 40 years. Up to 20 years ago,
huge profits were made in the industrial
rackets and in bootlegging. Up to 10
years ago, huge profits were made in
illegal racing information (through the
national wire services), off-track betting,
and gambling. The rackets today are
more petty; among them are the fight
game, numbers and narcotics, and the
last, where large windfalls can still be
made, is both risky and sleazy.
The real point to grasp about the
large sums of money gained previously


when long mileage and low overheads are really crucial. . •

Tough's the word for Olympic truck and bus tyres; they go a much longer way to cut operating

rugged treads, too, give longer life, improved braking and the traction to go when you need
it most. From ‘all-round’ highway tyres to heavy-duty tyres for mine and quarry jobs, the

in organised rackets is that much of it
has now been transferred to “legitimate”
business. Large sums of rackets money
are now invested in the wholesale liquor
industry, the dress business, small plastics
and fabricating companies, small steel
fabricating companies, and, of course, in
the legitimate gambling casinos of
Nevada as well as in the entertainment
business —record companies, night clubs,
and the like.
The sleazy rackets remain, but the
older racketeers have tended to move
away from them. Much more money
can be gained by going “legitimate”.
The real domain of organised crime
in the US, then, is no longer the old one
of outright illegality, but the more
shadowy one of dealing and corner-
cutting. And this is a much more
difficult world to deal with than the
imaginary world of the Cosa Nostra.
Yet such has been the transition of crime
as an American way of life.
One Million
Migrants
A migration corporation?
FROM DR. E. VON HOFMANNSTHAL
IN SYDNEY
The day of the white man in most
countries of Africa and Asia is at
an end, in spite of the lip-service
of some governments which assure the
white residents that they are welcome
and will be treated equally with the
colored population. Thus, there are
certainly far over one million people
who will have to leave their countries,
leaving their immovable assets, often the
product of generations, behind. Looking
for a country where they can live and
earn in safety and honor they cannot
find a better country than Australia and
to a lesser degree New Zealand. Aus-
tralia, now even more for political than
for economic reasons, needs white immi-
grants of the colonial type. She should
be willing to accept them and to assist
them in saving at least part of their
considerable property invested in the
countries they are forced to leave, in
her and their interest.
One of the reasons for squeezing the
whites out of Africa and Asian countries
is to appropriate their assets. There are
thousands of ways of doing it with or
without a legal cloak. Egypt has been
especially resourceful in inventing such
devices. Farms which a few years ago
were worth hundreds of thousands of
pounds are unsaleable even at a small
fraction of that price. The 2500 still
existing white farms of Kenya have
represented a value of far more than 100
million pounds. All kinds of violence
and tricks are used to prevent their sale.
One example: a white farmer had
already arranged the sale of his farm
to the neighboring tribe at a low price
to be paid by instalments out of the
proceeds. Another tribe threatened to
make war on the buying tribe unless it
desisted from the purchase, in order to
occupy the farm themselves for nothing.
The sale fell through. Similar, less blunt,
dangers threaten also urban enterprises,
apartment houses and private homes.
With diminishing exceptions, it must be
said that the property of whites in most
of these countries becomes more and
more unsaleable and the proceeds, if any,
untransferable.
The white settlers, although in some
places under growing danger of life and
limb, are lingering with their families in
leaving the country, hoping against hope
that it will be possible to save at least

something from the fruit of their and
their forefathers’ labor. They cannot
accept the thought of reaching a foreign
country as beggars. This time of frus-
trated waiting is lost for the integration
in a new country, for the education of
their children. Every month lost in wait-
ing is an economic loss for them as well
as for the country of immigration.
These difficulties and dangers could be
solved by an Australian corporation, pre-
ferably a Government corporation which
would facilitate the immigration to Aus-
tralia by acquiring at the same time the
assets of the immigrant at a nominal
price. At first consideration, let us call
it a down-payment, this company would
provide the immigrant with certain assets
necessary for his settlement which are
an excellent investment anyway. Then it
would proceed in administering and sell-
ing the property. Nobody should imagine
that the corporation would have smooth
sailing. But it would be in a better posi-
tion than the private seller. It cannot
be threatened or blackmailed. It is not a
citizen of the country and thus enjoys
the protection of international law. A
Government corporation would even
enjoy immunity under certain conditions.
End to frustration
TF at last the corporation succeeds in
obtaining a moderate price for the assets
acquired, the arrangement with the
seller should be that he receives the
largest part of this price less the down-
payment already received. Whether that
should be 90 or 50 per cent should
depend on the merits of the case and the
demerits of the country. The important
idea is that he does not give his property
away but can expect a considerable part
of the consideration if and when it will
be collected. And he can be sure that the
corporation will get a better deal than he
could have obtained. The balance,
whether it is 10 or 50 per cent, is to be
fairly retained by the corporation for
financing its activities.
Under such a scheme the emigrant
can leave sooner, start sooner his (and
his family’s) settlement in Australia.
Months or even years of frustration and
danger are converted into those of fertile
adaptation, with the hope of retrieving
something of the fruits of his past
labor and saving, anyway, more than
he could get' himself. The offer of the
Australian company is a lifeboat
approaching in his despair. It deepens
his feelings of gratitude to his new
country, thus makes him a better immi-
grant and citizen.
All this would be an asset for Aus-
tralia. She gets desirable immigrants at
an earlier date, will save some of their
property to their advantage and to that
of her economy.

RIVELAZIONI SUI DELITTI...
TT'or sheer gutsy journalism we won’t
forget easily the work this past
week of our local Italian newspaper,
“11 Globo”. The men at “II Globo”
were the first to have the courage to
point out in print that the Victorian
Market was rotten with extortion
rackets. Then they went on to
describe how Vincenzo Angilletta, the
first man killed, had a long criminal
record before he ever came to Aus-
tralia in 1951. They had the
Immigration Department hopping as
they hadn't hopped in years.
The story was set on its way by
“11 Globo”, then thrown up big
by the “Sun News - Pictorial.” The
reaction of most of us was: “What
now? How would these ’ll Globo’
people feel as they returned home
late at night, or maybe went out in-
to the garage in the early morning?”
“II Globo” is right in the Italian
area, at 125 Brunswick Street. You
see the signs in the shop windows,
SI PARLO ITALIANO, and all the
newsagents have the latest “11 Globo”
posters: “In Esclusivia RIVELA-
ZIONI SU I DELI T T I DEL
VICTORIA MARKET”.
Over the road is the Brunswick
Hotel, dated 1852, and all the
buildings are Victorian, with their
balustrades and urns on top. “II
Globo” is in such a building. It has
a circulation of 25,000, comes out
on Mondays with 14 to 18 pages,
and it has two mighty selling features;
they have two whole pages of Italian
soccer results, which start to come
through at 5 a.m. on Sunday, and
they have a TV supplement with all
the programmes in Italian.
Seeing that 80,000 to 90,000 of
Australia’s 350,000 Italian population
live in the Melbourne metropolitan
area, they do all right. But it comes
as a shock when you realise that
Melbourne is a bigger Italian town
than Reggio di Calabria, which has
only 60,000.
There are three main figures in the
“II Globo” team Übaldo Larobina,
32, the editor-in-chief and an ex-
reporter and sub-editor on “II Tempo”
in Rome; his co-founder, the company
secretary, Zeno Dardi, and Nino Ran-
dazzo, 31, the assistant editor. Laro-
bina was born in Calabria, Dardi
comes from Bologna, and Randazzo
from the Aeolian Islands, just north
of Sicily.
Zeno Dardi said that following
their first market story their circula-
tion went up 4000 and they received
nigh on 500 telephone calls and tele-
grams of congratulations.
One had to put the inevitable ques-
tion: Did anyone threaten you?
“Only cranks.”
How many? “Four.”
What did they say? “Oh, the
usual thing. You’d better lay off,
the Carlton cemetery’s not far away.”
How about Father Aldo, then?
Father Aldo is the 'ltalian-born parish
priest of Fitzroy. He’s been here nine
years, and before that he was six years
in the US. He is 37, good-looking
and muscular. He began his sermon
the Sunday before: “If I die, I leave
behind no children to die.” Father
Aldo is the priest who named the next
man on the death list and attacked
the stallholders for treating the coun-
try growers like slaves.
Oo what about Father Aldo, then?
Dardi said: “He is the most won-
derful person I have ever known. He
is a man who has plenty of courage.
He’s a worker-priest. He works 20
hours a day just to help individual
migrants.”
What about this business of ex-
ploitation of the growers at Mildura
and Robinvale? . . . “It’s all true.
Father Aldo knows the story better
than anybody.” Is he likely to be
shot? “I don’t think so. They know
that if he were killed somebody else
would take his place and he’d say
the same thing. But I don’t think
they would kill a priest. Even the
Mafia in Sicily would not do that.
The reaction would be too bad.”
The other side to this story was the
funeral of Vincent Muratore, 43, the
fruit merchant who was shot dead
outside his Hampton home on Janu-
ary 16. Estimates of Muratore’s
wealth went all the way up to
£BO,OOO. His funeral had something
of the atmosphere of the old Chicago
mobster funerals, and it was very like
the mighty funeral of Domenico Ita-
liano on December 13, 1962. Dome-
nico was known as “11 Papa” and he
died peacefully in his bed at the age
of 65. “II Papa” was the reputed boss,
and his death almost certainly started
off the present war of succession.
Over 1000 people turned out for
his funeral, including the entire cast
of the present adventure, Vincent
Muratore, Domenico Demarte and
the rest. But we haven’t seen many
funerals like it. It was directed by
Johnny Gattuso, the promoter, the
man who brought out Walter Chiari,
Ava Gardner’s smooth boyfriend.
The coffin was an improved model
on anything you can buy in Mel-
bourne. It was an oak casket, beauti-
fully carved, with silver fittings and
silver crucifixes on the lid. It was
put in position before the altar of
St Mary’s Star of the Sea Church,
West Melbourne, and it was flanked
by lighted candles. The body was
dressed in the brown habit of a
Capucin monk and a dress-shirt.
Outside the church there were
hundreds of wreaths formed into
crosses. Two of the cards were par-
ticularly interesting. One read: “With
deepest sympathy, D. Demarte”;
and the other, “Sympathy from A.
Monaco.” Domenico Demarte was
wounded outside his house in North
Melbourne on November 26, and
Antonio Monaco just managed to
survive two shot-gun blasts outside
his house at Braeside the previous
Saturday.
There were nigh on 1500 people
at the Muratore funeral, most of them
Italians, and it was heavily Con-
tinental, the women veiled, covered
in black, and crying. The pews were
packed. Some stood at the back of
the church and over 500 stood out-
side.
Muratore was buried in the Italian
section of the cemetery right next to
the grave of “11 Papa”, Domenico
Italiano, which has a massive-memor-
ial plus a handsome glazed photo-
graph of the man himself. And it was
interesting to see that “II Papa” on
this day did almost as well for flowers
as Muratore himself.

letters
to the
editor
SARAWAK AND INDONESIA
Sir,
Your issue of December 14 has only
just reached me, and I would like to
congratulate you on your excellent series
of articles on Indonesia. They are com-
prehensive, balanced and penetrating.
There are, however, three aspects of
your treatment of the Indonesian
problem as it affects Indonesia’s neigh-
bors, and especially Sarawak, upon
which I would like to comment.
Firstly, you do not, I suggest, suffi-
ciently stress . the utterly vicious
cynicism and brazen hypocrisy which
characterise the double talk of Indo-
nesians such as Subandrio. Indonesian
statements nearly always mean the reverse
of what they say and no confidence
whatever can be placed in Indonesian
assurances. Confrontation has been
accompanied by unbelievably venomous
personal attacks on our respected Prime
Minister, Tungku Abdul Rahman, over
the Indonesian Radio. This is coupled
with pious and entirely hypocritical ex-
pressions of hope for another summit
meeting and for the revival of still-born
Maphilindo. Whether this double talk
springs from an irresponsible attitude
towards international relationships or
from the fickle shifts of power in Indo-
nesian politics is of little importance at
the moment. The fact is no nation can
feel safe to act on Indonesian assurances.
Secondly, you do not bring to life the
savagery and brutality of the so-called
confrontation of Malaysia. It has meant
in Sarawak a whole series of murders
and attacks on villages by heavily armed
but cowardly gangs of terrorists along
a border which had known peace, apart
from occasional tribal conflicts, for more
than one hundred years. The victims
have been unarmed civilians, our own
Sarawak country people.
The only support for Indonesia in
Sarawak, apart from a handful of Malay
extremists, who are under the impression
that they have been oppressed by
Chinese, comes from our own Chinese
Communists. More than one thousand of
these people are being trained in Indo-
nesia for armed subversion and some
have already been sent back. We have
captured or killed quite a number. This
is being done despite the fact, as you
rightly point out, that most Indonesian
leaders are themselves violently anti-
Chinese, i.e., they are seeking to create
the very Chinese problem which they
profess to fear.
Thirdly, you do not explore the
possibilities of w'hat would happen if
confrontation was successful and
Malaysia crushed. This could only mean
the collapse of Malaysia, anarchy in a
key area of South-east Asia and the loss
to Australia and the rest of the demo-
cratic world of a small but staunch
friend, even if a politically rather young
one. Furthermore, Indonesia would never
be satisfied simply with crushing
Malaysia. It must, because of its turbulent
internal trouble, whether in the form
of corruption in government organs or
dissatisfaction because of economic mis-
management, press on with further ex-
pansionist projects. These would un-
questionably be directed against either
or both the southern Muslim Philippines
(where Indonesian subversion is no new
thing) or against Papua-New Guinea. The
latter would be the easier target.
You must also recognise that just as
Malaysia, because of its prosperity and
stable operation of government, has been
regarded as a menace to Indonesian
unity, Australian New' Guinea can be
looked upon as a threat to Indonesian
control of West New' Guinea. The more
effort Australia puts into the uplift of
the people of Australian New Guinea
the more irritable the Indonesians may
feel at the contrast Australia is putting
up next door. Malaysia may be a symbol
of what Indonesia regards as a reminder
of its failings and a rival form of govern-
ment that should not be shown to the
Indonesian people.
HAVING spent five happy and reward-
ing years learning to be a lawyer as a
Colombo Plan student in Adelaide, I
understand the Australian viewpoint and
regard the Australian dilemma with the
greatest sympathy. I am not one who
feels that Australia and New Zealand
are letting dow'n their friends in Malaysia
by not sending troops into Sarawak and
Sabah—much though we w'ould like to
see them here. I know that I speak for
nearly all Sarawakians w'hen I say that
w'e enormously appreciate all the help
we, as a small developing country, have
received from Australia and New
Zealand since our liberation from the
Japanese by Australian forces. We know
that the tw'o well-trained units from
Australia and New Zealand now in
Malaya are playing a most valuable role
in helping to stabilise the situation simply
by being there.
I apologise for the length of this letter,
but I do want to make the point that,
as next-door neighbors of Indonesia,
w'e in Sarawak have also wished the
people of Indonesia well. We, too, have
W'ished to live in peace and amity W'ith
her. But all we have received in exchange
for our goodwill is a savage kick in the
teeth. You can lean over backwards in
being nice and civilised and friendly to
Indonesia, but in her present state of
strident megalomania it would be folly
for Australians to think that just being
nice will prevent Indonesia from turning
its covetous eyes on Australia in the end.

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
Sir,
Apropos the hanging in Western Aus-
tralia, on January 20, the quotations in
“Plain English” (18/1/64) refer to the
deterrent and ethical aspects of capital
punishment and ignore an aspect peculiar
to Australia and other nations with a
federal constitution.
It can be argued that whereas the
term salus populi est suprema lex
formerly justified capital punishment,
modern society now demands in the
interests of justice that the rehabilitation
of all types of criminals be an acceptable
risk to society. But Australia is artificially
divided into six States, or societies, with
six criminal codes. Thus justice cannot
be served so long as the life of a citizen
depends on which side of an imaginary
(boundary) line he commits his crime
and on what particular political party is
in office in a particular State.
It was difficult enough to secure a
uniform marriage law. At present it
would be nigh impossible to secure a
uniform criminal code. Without a
uniform criminal code, capital punish-
ment in Australia, except for treason,
cannot be justified.

THE SOUTHERN CLOUD
Sir,
M. H. Ellis’s review of “Southern
Cloud” (18/1/64) leaves a nasty taste in
the mouth. It is a great pity that this
critic did not find out all the relevant
details about the author of the book
before the review was composed. Ap-
parently Mr Ellis has jumped to the
common erroneous conclusion that when
an author uses initials it indicates that
the author is a male, unless, of course,
Mr Ellis is merely showing sarcastic dis-
approval of such usage by the fair sex.
We are tempted to launch into vigorous
defence of the book and its author, from
the facts we know, and which Mr Ellis
apparently does not know; but we are
of the opinion that Miss Carter, a senior
Melbourne “Herald” staff journalist, is
well able to defend herself and her
authorship from such flippancy, regard-
less of Mr Ellis’s opinion. The book is
a well-written documentary of events
which are now part of Australia’s history,
and Miss Carter has used a journalist’s
eye for detail, including in the book not
only the loss of the “Southern Cloud”
but also the events leading up to, and
since, that tragedy; and the inclusion of
details re the people who took part in


these events, however unnecessary such
trivialities may seem to Mi Ellis, seems
to make sense to us.
At least Mr Ellis concedes, unwillingly,
we suspect, that the book will become
part of aviation history—with that we
heartily agree. For Mr Ellis’s informa-
tion the writer of this letter is a female!

SOVIET WHEAT
Sir,
It is difficult to agree with Mr E. J.
Donath’s suggestion (18/1/64) that a
harvest of the order of that of 1958
could again make the USSR a large
wheat exporting country. The official
gross harvest of all types of grain for
1962 exceeded that of 1958, but, far
from allowing a resumption of large-
scale exports by the Soviet Union, this
apparently did not even allow her to
lay in sufficient grain to tide her over a
poor year. A population growth of over
3 million per year means that the USSR
will need to do better than equal past
harvests if she is to avoid becoming a
permanent importer of wheat.
As the current crash programme to
develop the long-neglected fertilizer in-
dustry begins to take effect, the hitherto
chronically low crop fertility on State
and collective farms cannot but improve.
The process, however, will not be a rapid
one, and many grain-growing areas have
been told that years will elapse before
fertilizers will reach them in desirable
quantities. In the meantime, if Aus-
tralia’s wheat legislation is, as Mr
Donath says, based largely on difficulties
in the Soviet bloc, then it may well be
soundly based after all.

“DISSENT’"
Sir,
Dr Frank Knopfelmacher’s review of
“Dissent” (28/12/63) charges the maga-
zine and its editors with lack of intel-
lectual integrity and honesty. A serious
charge—until one realises that his view
of intellectual integrity and honesty
seems, to say the least, idiosyncratic.
His review boils down to the point that,
although the editors are intelligent about
Communism, they are, however, soft on
it, because they are dominated by the
“corrupt” political party of which they
are members.
The evidence Dr Knopfelmacher brings
for his assertions is, to use his own words,
“inadequate and inept”. I would be in-
terested to read examples supplied by Dr
Knopfelmacher where “the requirements
of intellectual honesty are crudely flouted
whenever Santamaria Catholics are in
any way involved”. And, searching for
evidence in back copies of “Dissent,” I
just can't find any support for his claim
that the Communist Party and the DLP
are juxtaposed. Both are attacked, quite
rightly in my opinion, but nowhere can
1 find a statement which in any way
equates them.
The unfortunate “equation” is rather
Dr Knopfelmacher’s. The impression he
leaves, whether he means it or not, is
that opposition to the DLP and Mr
Santamaria must be equated with in-
tellectual dishonesty: a Grimm’s fairy-tale
idea of the situation for the many people
(not only “Dissent” editors) who are
anti-Communists but who still have
strong objections to the DLP and, indeed,
find some worth in the ALP.
PATRICIA HEALY
Melbourne (Vic.).
Sir,
Frank Knopfelmacher patronisingly
praised the editors of “Dissent” for not
“orbiting in the Communist sun,” and
then proceeded to argue that they com-
promised themselves because they did
not print articles on Soviet culture, Cuba,
Djilas’ gaoling, Profumo. The argument
is complete nonsense, since the editors
have printed many articles which fellow-
travellers must find offensive, articles
attacking neutralism, Soviet policies on
the Jews, on Chinese Communist failures,
in favor of State aid, etc., etc. Perhaps
the fact that there were two articles
which Dr Knopfelmacher calls “Leftist
ritual” merely indicates that the editors
believe in that old-fashioned notion of
free speech.

ALL-FREIGHT AIRLINE
Sir,
Your article (18/1/64) regarding our
plans to establish an all-freight airline
stated the position pretty accurately. It
is not, however, simply a case of IPEC’s
right to establish a new airline industry.
This country, with its centres of trade
and industry separated by great distances,
badly needs efficient transit systems. The
unreliability of air-freight has forced
most shippers to use alternatives which,
although more efficient than air transport
as it is presently available, are con-
siderably slower over long distances
than a well-run air-freight system should
and could be. The result, in generally
increasing the costs and frictions of pro-
duction and distribution, is of very con-
siderable national interest.
The persistent decline in air-freight
carried in this country over the past
decade indicates that the two major
domestic airlines are not able to provide
a service to meet the needs of Australian
shippers and the real question is whether
the Government proposes to let this
deplorable situation continue.

YIRRKALA MISSION
Sir,
Your Melbourne correspondent has
been misinformed on the position at
Yirrkala Methodist Mission, in Arnhem
Land (11/1/64). In the interests of truth
I think the following facts should be
stated:—
1. The Board at no time discussed the
Select Committee or its work, nor does
it know what part Mr Wells played in
this, or what evidence he gave apart
from slight references in the Press.
2. The Rev. E. A. Wells was not
“sacked” by the Mission Board. In the
interests of the church’s work and with
all the facts before it the Mission Board
transferred Mr Wells to Milingimbi, a
large and important aboriginal work in
Arnhem Land. 3. Mr Wells indicated
that he would not go to Milingimbi but
would return to the home work of the
church. With his decision the Board
agreed. 4. The Methodist Church has
procedures by which any minister may
appeal should he consider an injustice
has been done. Mr Wells has made no
such appeal. 5. The policy of the
Mission Board in connection with mining
at Yirrkala was substantially the same
as that of 1958 when the bauxite mining
lease was proposed and the Mission
Board had written into the lease clauses
protecting the aborigines’ rights. This
was well known. We know of no protest
from Mr Wells or from anyone else on
this.
The Methodist Church has no cause
to be ashamed of its part in the struggle
against the exploitation of the aborigines
and in working for their rights and
welfare.

HAY OR SILAGE
Sir,
The article on the merits of “Hay or
Silage as the Better Fodder” (14/12/63)
in itself may be quite accurate, but I
feel that to be of any value to the man
on the land it should have been carried
through to the most important step
the economic evaluation of the two types
of feed. Whilst the weight gains attained
by hay may have been greater than
silage of equal protein content on a dry
matter basis (and I presume that was
how it was judged), was the increase in
proportion, to the increased cost of
making hay to the cost of silage? This
after all is the very crux of modern-day
farming—the cost of production to at-
tain income.

MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY
Sir,
John Johnston’s letter on Melbourne
University affairs (18/1/64) omitted to
mention two matters. The first is that
he is currently president of the MU
ALP Club, and the second is that,
though he was elected president of
Student Action in 1961, he has never
been re-elected. Indeed, this would be
impossible, for Student Action, as it then
was, does not now exist.

REVIEWS
ART
The Mask and the Face
Traditional and avant-garde portraits at the Archibald
By JOHN HENSHAW
Archibald, Wynne, and Sulman Prizes
for 1963. Art Gallery of New South
Wales.
Qince these awards began in 1921, 1897
and 1936 respectively the terms
under which they were conceived apply
less and less as the years go by. So
many competitors for the Sulman (of
which I was judge) had no idea that
“subject painting” might be distinct from
genre, still life, portrait or even land-
scape. Paradoxically some purely
abstract pictures grope more assuredly
for grand subjects than their “traditional”
brethren. Happily, the Archibald now
shows dozens of portraits of friends by
friends, being compromised to the extent
of admitting the possibility of a great
painting of someone unknown
Portrait painting as a major concern
of avant-garde artists declined many
years ago, but it hasn't died. In the US
a fair number of experimental painters
have taken time off to paint people who
interested them and in the process have
brought a new suppleness of technique,
spatial order and composition to their
work.
Great portrait painters have always
gone beyond superficial appearance, even
the most deceptively realistic of them.
Ingre's prophetic study of the architect
Debedan (1810), Degas’ portraits of his
Neapolitan relatives, the Montejasi-Cic-
erale, Goya’s rich characterisation of
Dona Isabel Cobos de Porcel (1806) in
the National Gallery, London, enter
realms of super-reality which the photo-
graph cannot touch. Of the tw'o broad
approaches, Ingre’s tussling with the
vagaries of appearance in order to attune
their flux to the ideal concepts of his
romantically classic imagination (a view-
point roughly similar to Modigliani’s if
one substitutes Pacific carvings for Greek
gods), or the other implicit in the Goyas
and explicit in Soutine, Kokoschka and
the vast majority of northern and central
European artists, where the forms are
reconstituted according to an emotionally
charged series of impressions caught up
by the artist’s conscious will—neither
permits a neutral recording but pushes
towards some more concrete realisation.
The Archibald has little direct in-
fluence on the movement to or away
from our concern for portraits. It will
remain, for the time being, a repository
of styles largely conservative, but the con-
temporary element will slowly increase.
When it comes to styles and fashions,
in fifty years no one will care tuppence
how so and so painted, just as the
suburban house of 1919 or 1930 or
1955 are on one level of design quality,
and make for equality of living. What
will concern people will be whether so
and so had anything to say.
Such an evaluation must await the
work of Jack Carrington-Smith, whose
reticent portrait of James McAuley won
this latest Archibald prize. Over the
years Carrington-Smith quite frequently
put up the strongest entries for com-
petition, concerned as they were with
structural qualities of form, truthfulness
of statement and careful draughtsman-
ship. It is easy to dismiss these things
as outmoded, but they are likely to
remain essential to the art. In retrospect
Carrington-Smith’s win was well de-
served.
lyioLViG’s “Joy Roggenkamp” displays
considerable charm, both of char-
acter and handling, agreeableness of
color, for all its slightness of drawing.
Both Connor and Sibley provide strong
elements of emotional conviction, but
their strengths become weaknesses in
throwing together articulate forms. Judy
Cassab makes an almost monumental
statement of Oscar Edward’s massive
form, loosening only on her organisation
of light passages around chest and head.
Kahan's theatrical, green-eyed Robert
Hughes must have irritated the sitter(?)
with its melodramatic posturing. The
portrait of the Governor-General, Vis-
count De L’lsle, is more interesting but
reveals, despite careful painting of the
rather solemn face and hands, a real con-
flict between textured background, body
shape conceived flatly and sculpturally
at the same time, and acutely rendered
detail—a most curious work indeed.
Feurring displays textural astuteness but
fails to equate his drawing with it, while
Vladas Meskenas tends to overheat and
overpaint some very interesting ideas of
form. Other portraits of interest by
Rigby and Joe Rose match traditional
competence of works in the other rooms.
The winning Wynne painting, “Sand-
hills on the Darling” by Sam Fullbrook,
brings a subtle organisation of quiet,
light color out of his subject. Beneath
this is a very genuine feeling for outback
landscape which belies the thinness of
handling. Of more abstract works, Guy
Warren's “Estuary in Moonlight, Shoal-
haven” more than equals Fred Williams’
“You-Yang Landscape” beside it. Tom
Green, Storm Gould, Gazzard, Curtis
chime in with landscape conceived from
the “inside”. Their opposite numbers
Salmon, Ray Crooke, Frank Bennett and
others compete with the “outside” view.
Whether Kevin Connor's “Portrait of
Sydney” or Alfred Cook’s equally
panoramic “The Black Mountain”
amount to statements of equal signifi-
cance, we will leave to future genera-
tions. Eva Kubbo’s winning watercolor
could be conceived equally well as a
central European abstraction as its Aus-
tralian subject. The paint is attractive
and variable like its neighbors Salkauskas,
Guy Warren and Fred Williams. Other
skilful watercolors enliven a modest, if
not outrageously exciting, Wynne.

Television is necessarily the most
compromised artistic medium. It
has, in fact, so compromised itself that,
as a medium, it rarely warrants the
description, “artistic”. And yet, poten-
tially, because a television programme is
a one-time thing, and because the
producer of television has great technical
resources at his disposal, it has great
possibilities for spontaneous expression.
But it relies, to a far greater extent
than its comparables, theatre and film,
on its audience, and a fickle audience
at that. People go to the theatre or the
cinema by choice; they watch television
because it's in the living-room. Con-
sequently, plot becomes the operative
ingredient in the success of television
drama. For only when a script can
capture the Ben-Casey-conscious and
still have some merit independently, can
television attempt something more than
merely bumping up the ratings and
separating the commercials.
The English television networks have
discovered such a formula, in their
increasing adaptations of literary classics.
The BBC has predictably given Dickens


and Shakespeare. Toe often, though,
in these Dickens adaptations imagina-
tion has been sacrificed to efficiency, and
the producers have turned them into
comic-strips rather than television drama.
Not so with “Emma”. Jane Austen’s
homely chronicle of Highbury and its
match-making and romantic intrigues
would not seem to be popular fare. But
all the delicacy and precision which
makes the novel great, distinguishes the
translation, and what is objectively
trivial becomes wholly fascinating. Con-
sistently well acted (notably by Paul
Daneman as Mr Kmghtley) and unpre-
tentiously produced, the episodes I have
seen extracted every nuance and casual
implication from the story, while never
at the story's expense.
Far more ambitious is “The Stories
of Guy de Maupassant”. De Maupas-
sant’s tales are rather like limericks.
They are written for their endings. That
their endings so often send up their
beginnings, and their beginnings give
false indications of their endings, is their
peculiar attraction. They are a mannered
burlesque, constantly echoing what has
come before, to the extent of identical
conversations taking place between
different characters —like limericks, they
have internal rhyme. They are self-
indulgent stories, packed with puns and
caricature, placing people in embarras-
sing or confusing situations and laughing
at the way they fumble their way out
of them. The irony is deliberate, but it
is kindly, and, if de Maupassant makes
people look absurd, he never makes them
grovel. It is the exactness with which
the producer has realised the affectionate
parody, and the inverted self-parody,
which makes the series such a complete
success.
“The Inheritance”, on Wednesday
night, concerned impotency. The
ambitious Lesable marries the heiress
Cora for her anticipated fortune, only
to find the will requires the birth of a
child within three years, otherwise the
money goes to charity. Unfortunately,
the effeminate Lesable can’t comply, and,
with the greedy father-in-law and the
frustrated wife on his back, goes through
hell (and several doctors) trying. This
amusing central situation, wildly over-
characterised by de Maupassant and the
actors, breeds a succession of hilarious
side incidents and repercussions (there
is a beautiful moment when Cachelin,
the father-in-law, advises Lesable not to
brood on his inadequacy, saying, “. . . a
watched pot never boils”), until the
ironical conclusion. Repeatedly there
were surprises, and occasionally there
was pathos, but the producer never
allowed the pace to fall off and used
his jaunty music to assert the dominant
mood a mood of wordliness and
flippancy.
Television does not have to be in-
tellectual to be artistic, a fact apparently
not fully grasped in Australia, or in
New York (“The Robert Herridge
Theatre”), nor must it be socially con-
scious (“The Defenders”) If the
producer can rely on an intelligent and
a palatable script, and period adaptations
provide this, then the product can be
creative and it can be good; as good as
“The Stories of Guy de Maupassant”.
WILLIAM DANIELS
MUSIC
Hindemith
¥>aul Hindemith, who died in Frank-
•*- furt recently, aged 68, was one of
the most versatile musicians of his time.
Best known as a composer, he was also
a noted teacher and theorist, a concert
violinist and violist, a skilled performer
on (it is said) twelve other instruments,
a conductor, and a musical administrator
whose achievements included the organ-
isation of Turkey’s musical life along
European lines in the late 19305.
Hindemith spent the 1920 s experi-
menting and defying convention. He
dabbled in polytonality, atonality, and
jazz. He wrote for unconventional instru-
mental combinations in unconventional
musical forms, and called the finished
works simply “chamber music” or “con-
cert music”. He parodied operatic con-
ventions in his opera “News of the Day”,
for which he wrote the libretto. (The
opera’s high point was a scene in which
the heroine lay in a hotel bathtub and
sang the praises of electric heating: a
Breslau gas company, worried about
possible effects on business, sought and
obtained an injunction prohibiting the
opera’s performance in that town.)
Hindemith’s early works also -include
a number of items of “gebrauchsmusik”
(i.e., music for use, utility music), among
them a score for a “Felix the Cat”
film, a series of pieces for beginners on
the violin, and a work called “The
Lesson”, whose stated aim was just “to
employ all present”. The aim of these
works was to try to bridge the gap
between the serious composer and the
man in the street. In the 1930 s Hinde-
mith stepped down from the role of
musical rebel and began to consolidate
the results of his earlier activities. He
produced a book outlining the
theoretical basis of his harmonic syntax,
in which he referred to what had gone
before as a “transition from conservative
training to a new freedom”, hinting that
the period of experiment was now
ended; he had lived through the transi-
tion, he said, “more intensely than most”.
The “new freedom” which he had
attained was in fact a new orthodoxy,
to which he adhered for the rest of his
life, and which he used as a basis for
criticism of more “advanced” music His
attitude towards young serialist com-
posers after the Second World War
resembled Strauss’ attitude to him a
generation earlier.
The “new freedom” was also accom-
panied by a decline in adventurousness
and, to some extent, in output. Hinde-
mith’s concern with the problem of the
relationship between the artist and the
community manifested itself in the
1930 s in an increased readiness to write
for relatively conventional media in
relatively conventional musical forms.
His best known works the symphony
“Matthias the Painter”, the ballet suite
“Nobilissima Visione”, the piano con-
certo “The Four Temperaments”, and the
funeral music for King George VI
date from this period.
Ironically, the composers with whom
Hindemith’s mature style has most
affinity are the giants of his student days,
Reger and Strauss. Reger’s influence can
be clearly seen in Hindemith’s attach-
ment to busy and rather superfluous
counterpoint, and his tendency to eke
out ideas by imitative part-writing. Like
Strauss, Hindemith is an inferior
melodist, whose themes are too often
merely collections of melodic fragments
instead of homogeneous units. His
chromaticism, like Strauss’, often serves
to conceal the fact that the musical
material lacks interest. (Tovey recounts
finding that a tune in a violin sonata,
which the violinist could not play in
tune with Hindemith’s accompaniment,
“lent itself quite naturally to harmoniza-
tion in terms of Spohr”.) His harmony,
like Strauss’, is quite diatonic, despite
its overlay of chromaticism.
In several other respects, Hindemith
and Strauss can be contrasted quite
sharply generally to Hindemith’s dis-
advantage. Strauss was a master of in-
strumentation: Hindemith’s instrumenta-
tion is mostly merely dull. Strauss suited
the style to the mood: Hindemith’s style
is depressingly homogeneous. Strauss’
music often has a directness and exuber-
ance that outweighs its limitations:
Hindemith’s is mostly quite unengaging.
Nevertheless, Hindemith has been a
significant figure. His style has had a
great fascination for several generations
of students: though only three composers
of any note, Rawsthorne, Reizenstein
and Dello Joio, show any trace of it in
their mature work. (Most younger com-
posers for instance, the Sydney com-
poser Richard Meale—have abandoned
the Hindemith manner at a fairly early
stage.) And his best music has, as Virgil
Thompson remarked, “a moral elevation
and a straightforward honesty that make
it impossible not to respect and to admire
it for being at all times unquestionably
‘good’ music.”

The Celluloid Revolution
Since World War It, a dazzling cinema renaissance

period of cinema history from the
“*■ end of the war to date has been
an immensely rich one in almost every
film-producing country. From Europe,
the Americas and Asia wave after wave
of superb and original films has swept
round the world, for this is the first time
foreign films have circulated beyond
their immediate locale. The makers of
these Aims comprise a few prewar
veterans, but by far the majority of the
interesting ones have been made by
artists who began making films in just
about this period: Kurosawa, Bergman,
Kazan, Satyajit Ray, Wajda, Antonioni,
Bresson, Bardem, Torre-Nilsson, and so
on.
A new Pelican on the contemporary
cinema by the editor of “Sight and
Sound” is an appetising prospect. It turns
out to be an unsatisfying meal. After
some routine factual background on the
postwar decline of audiences and the
impact of TV, we get on to the history.
Miss Houston’s strategy is to devote
a chapter or two each to Italy, France,
the UK, the USA, Eastern Europe and
to bundle the rest (Japan, Sweden,
Argentina, India, etc.) into a single
chapter. No doubt to solve her
organisational problem in the book she
had to proceed in this way by countries.
But need the allocation of space bear
so little relation to the quality of what
is discussed? Certainly Bergman and
Kurosawa deserve as much space as
any English director. These artists are
surely greater than anyone working in
the UK, and therefore worth as much
space. Thus I cannot see the logic of
spending a chapter on the UK and giving
Japan and Sweden only part of one.
Equally unsatisfactory is the tactics of
her approach within the chapters. The
chapter “The Italian Experience”
proceeds thus. Immediately after the
war some Italian film makers' threw
aside all commercial considerations and
made some realistic films (neo-realism).
This was an “explosion” (p. 22). These
realist films were a financial flop, so
commerce reasserted itself until quite
recently when a new crop of directors,
indebted to neo-realism, came to the
fore. “Meanwhile” Antonioni was
“found” . . . “to speak for the sixties”
(p. 29). End of summary.
This is not serious criticism. It is not
analytical, and it ignores the important
questions like: Who are the serious artists
of the contemporary Italian cinema?
Rossellini, De Sica, Visconti, Fellini?
If so why, if not why not? The later
careers of Visconti and Rossellini in
particular show up the absurdity of
trying to analyse them under the catch-
phrase “the neo-realistic movement”.
To get herself out of such difficulties,
Miss Houston relies heavily on the
Decline Theory. This is the theory that
artists have a certain purity and
discipline in their first efforts, but that
this is later corrupted by commerce, or
senility, or overwork, or something. Miss
Houston employs this theory again and
again. Rossellini’s “Open City” is praised
because it is “raw” and unphoney: his
“Paisa” is already a bit contrived; and
after that he has been “in search of a
subject” (p. 28). De Sica is praised for
the purity and social purpose of his
“Shoeshine” and “Bicycle Thieves”; but
as he goes on and “as his own playing,
in other men’s films, has grown more
florid ... so his sensibilities as a film-
maker seem to have become blunted”
(p. 25). (Whereas, I would say, bad film
though it was, “The Condemned of
Altona” is the best piece of mise en scene
De Sica has ever managed.) Visconti
began by making disciplined master-
pieces but then his “instinct for excess
. . . that taste for grand opera . . . [is]
barely kept in check by the disciplinary
tug of fact” (p. 27) and we get the
theatricalities and melodrama of “Rocco
e i Suoi Fratelli.”
HPhe Decline Theory loses any plausibil-
A ity it began with because it is applied
to so many directors: Sir Carol Reed, Or-
son Welles, Fred Zinnemann are others.
Doubtless some may have declined, but
more often one suspects Miss Houston
resorts to the theory whenever she isn’t
as impressed by the later films of a
director as she was by his first. Yet it
could well be simply that the novelty
has worn off, or that the critic inter-
preted the director in a particular way
but the director was perverse enough to
go off on a track on his own, or maybe
simply that the critic made an over-
enthusiastic valuation in the first place.
Maybe the critic needs to rethink.
Curiously, when Miss Houston conies
to France she does not employ the
Decline Theory. This may be because
it has already been made to look
ridiculous by the new wave directors
who believe that practically all their
elders except Renoir are played-out
fuddy-duddies. Yet Miss Houston still
gives equal space to the new wave,
which issues from 1958-9, as to all the
years 1946-58 when some very rich
French cinema was produced Renoir
gets two pages, Bresson one and Cocteau
less, and their best post-war work has
yet to be touched by anything of the
new wave.
Perhaps the real test of such a book
is the section on the British cinema. We
are told of the forties follies, followed
by the early fifties gloom—relieved only
by the Ealing comedies —and then the
Free Cinema break-through! Free
Cinema, of all things! A phoney piece
of self-publicity by Lindsay Anderson
and his pals (Reisz, Richardson) —-
frustrated critics who wanted to break
into films. How oversimplified and
lacking in perspective can an analysis
get? How do artists like Reed, Lean,
Olivier, Asquith, Mac Kendrick, Crichton,
Hamer fit into this? Those that aren’t
subjected to the “decline” theory (Reed
and, by implication, Lean) are just
brushed off. Crichton isn’t even men-
tioned, although I’d trade “The League
of Gentlemen” for anything by the
Free Cinema gang. Richard 111 isn’t
mentioned; Michael Powell and his
masterpiece “Peeping Tom” isn’t
mentioned; strong, competent talents like
J. Lee Thomson (“Tiger Bay,” “Cape
Fear”), John Guillermin (“Never Let
Go”) and Val Guest (“Hell is a City”)
are never discussed. Instead there is a
chapter which indiscriminately bundles
Richardson, Reisz and Anderson with
artists who have a firmer claim to be
taken seriously, like Clayton, Schlesinger
and Bryan Forbes. Miss Houston con-
nects Free Cinema with an alleged wave
of “semi-cultural, semi-political” protest
into which she links the Royal Court,
“New Left Review” and the Alder-
maston march! Such total failure to
single out what is serious and worth-
while from the merely well-publicised
mars the whole book.
It comes as no surprise after all this
that the section on the American cinema
is at times grotesque. Kazan’s films are
dismissed, incredibly, as “a dazzling
display of muscle flexing” (p. 71). Welles
is passed over as a “conjurer” (p. 167)
with hardly a word on his brilliant fifties
films (“Othello,” “Mr Arkadin,” “Touch
of Evil”). Minnelli, Huston, Zinnemann
are all subjected to the Decline Theory.
But I cannot go on with these lists.
This book is neither original nor serious.
It is a compendium of unargued cliches
—that they are “Sight and Sound” cliches


is no excuse. 1 found the paragraphs
devoted to Antonioni, Bergman. Minnelli,
Kurosawa, Welles indeed all the
directors I admire and take seriously—
totally inadequate and unsatisfying. For
example. Miss Houston writes,
“Antonioni’s themes are familiar enough:
breakdown of communication has
become the catchword of the age” (p. 31).
Indeed it has, yet I do not see that this
catchword is in any way relevant to
Antonioni’s films, or would suffice to
explain their greatness even if it were,
and therefore has any place in a serious
study of them.
Even in a journalistically popular
book one does not expect lopsided
emphases, bad argument, snap judgments
on serious film-makers. Imagine how
unacceptable would be a similarly
cavalier treatment of Contemporary
Poetry or the Contemporary Novel. That
M iss Houston sees fit to treat the cinema
this way can only sadden those of us
who lament the fact that it is not taken
seriously enough as an art form.
To turn from this to a new edition
of Mr Taylor’s survey of British
dramatists from Osborne onwards is to
move to another level altogether. Mr
Taylor’s first chapter of 11 pages and
his Epilogue of 8 are all he devotes to
trends. For the rest his book is a close
critical study of the plays, productions
and texts, artist by artist. The artists
are grouped around their alma mater,
The Royal Court, Theatre Workshop,
TV and Radio, etc. A whole chapter
is devoted to the one playwright Mr
Taylor regards as of outstanding
importance: Harold Pinter. Taylor
admits his grouping of writers is an
arbitrary convenience and he does not
read significance into his groups. He
doesn’t, for example, try to argue there
is a Royal Court or Theatre Workshop
“movement”. He passes no judgment
without a meticulous examination of
play and production (except for the odd
acid aside on film versions of the plays),
for which he seems to have a
phenomenally retentive memory.
Taylor writes in a deceptively con-
versational style which serves to under-
emphasise his extremely careful phrasing
and analysis. His views are original and
interesting. He suggests that John
Osborne with Luther shows signs of
substituting a Rattigan-like craftsman-
ship for his initial fervor, but he admits
that the atrocious “Blood of the
Bambergs” and the interesting but
flawed "Under Plain Cover,” which
were produced after his first edition
appeared, shake his theory. The analysis
of Wesker, as a basically preachy Left-
winger struggling desperately to make
theatrical statements is involved and
subtle. Wesker’s self-liberation from
naturalism is chronicled and the con-
clusion that “the debilitating effect that
his inability to see that things may in
fact be other than he thinks they ought
to be has on his ability to express his
ideas in properly dramatic terms” (p. 148)
is most forcefully argued.
But most of all there is his discussion
of Pinter, whose plays, “whether we
accept or reject them. . . . are
monumentally and inescapably there, the
artifact triumphantly separated from the
artist, self-contained and self-supporting”.
They are in fact “the true poetic drama
of our time”, the musical use of words.
The author's ability to tell a story
means that “Anger and After” is
absorbing as well as thorough. Its author
writes film reviews for “The Times”,
articles and reviews for “The Times
Literary Supplement” and, it is no secret,
is the columnist “Arkadin” of “Sight
and Sound”. He is young, obviously
hugely enjoys cinema and theatre, and
has managed in this book to present a
balanced and mature survey of the
revival of drama in England only seven
years after it began.

A History of the Australian Country
Party. Ulrich Ellis. Melbourne
University Press. 50s.
If puzzled about a gift for any of the
many new boys in Federal Parliament
you have the problem solved in this
second of two source books on the
Country Party, written by Ulrich Ellis.
(The first was his history of the party in
New South Wales.) It might seem that
history writing runs in the Ellis family,
Ulrich being a brother of Malcolm
(M.H.). Ulrich's manifestation is differ-
ent and specialised. He warns the reader
early in this new volufne not to look for
objectivity the book, he says, “is
written from a point of view, from in-
side looking out”. In a 360-page volume,
copiously illustrated and as full of
miscellany as an old-time country store,
there is nevertheless a lot of reassuring
detachment, especially when you con-
sider that as its first and its outstanding
back room boy (in the beginning he
really was no more than a boy), Mr
Ellis was through four decades quite
prominently engaged in making Country
Party history before he settled down to
record it. He is now established in
Armidale as the apostle of the New
States movement, for which he has done
more than any other single individual —
not excluding the late Sir Earle Page,
whose amanuensis and precursor Mr
Ellis was through what conjointly were
the critical years of the Country Party
and of the singular career of “the Doc.”.
(While this is another piece of its history,
unrecorded up to this moment, the
Country Party has shown poor apprecia-
tion of his contributions to its survival;
something that Mr Ellis himself wouldn’t
realise, having been so long on the in-
side looking out.)
The minutae of his research, for a lot
of which he had the advantage of his
own recollections, is tremendous. Side
by side, with an entertainingly deadpan
presentation, be it conscious or not, Mr
Ellis has provided a number of caution-
ary tales. It is this feature which suggests
to me the particular value which their
Ellis on the Australian Country Party
will have for the new boys. They will
learn of some high drama in machina-
tions behind the introduction of prefer-
ential voting, one of the staggering
variety of direct imprints which the
Country Party has made on the fabric
of Australian politics. Also, that the
party rather expects the detestation
which Liberals and Laborites alike share
for it, though it has been bedfellow of
both in its time; but that there are
macabre case histories of politicos,
great and small, who have tried to
snatch the party’s share of the melon.
Another of Mr Ellis’s stories is of the
time, a time which hardly any Australian
doesn’t regard but as a time of truce and
oneness, when the party even turned to
its advantage the collusion of the whole
of the rest of Parliament in the matter
of the 1934 Melbourne Cup. For the
new boys, this is as good a guide to
Country Party form as any.
Often accused of caring more for
office than principles, the Country Party
joins Governments only when it thinks
fit, and on its own terms. Because it
wanted tariff reductions and got only a
half-promise that proved worthless, it
refused to join the Lyons Government
in 1932. It was after the 1934 elections
that the Melbourne Cup incident healed
the breach with an effectiveness nothing
else had achieved. The armistice con-
tinued for six years, until the monu-
mental fallout between Sir Earle Page
and Mr Menzies. But not all the credit
should be chalked up to Australia’s love
of the horse.
After the 1934 elections Mr Lyons
approached the then Dr Page with a
coalition proposition that proved un-
acceptable, because it didn’t go far
enough on tariff reductions and offered
too few portfolios to Country Party
men. (It is a topical matter today that
the Country Party expects an allotment
of portfolios “on the basis of its
numerical strength’’.) Mr Lyons was
equally adamant about counter-proposi-
tions. A week after the new House
assembled he came down with a proposal
that looked like being supported as
unanimously as one for a salary rise
that the House adjourn so that members


could attend the Melbourne Cup. When
Dr Page announced that he would
oppose the motion, Labor, seeing a cer-
tain opportunity of defeating the Gov-
ernment, also said it was opposed. Never
a horsey man anyhow, Mr Lyons
promptly abandoned the motion. It had
been a close call, and reopening of
coalition negotiations was (says Mr
Ellis) “an immediate result”. Mr Lyons
gave Dr Page assurances that decisions
in regard to tariff would “be of such a
character as would be generally accept-
able to the Country Party”, and besides
increasing the number of portfolios
offered he capitulated further in agreeing
that the leader of the Country Party
should be Deputy Prime Minister.
CVjllowing the publication early last
year of “Truant Surgeon”, the
autobiography of Sir Earle Page, the ru-
mor has been around that a book by, or
authorised by, Lord Bruce will appear
in due course. This should be a check
balance on claims put forward in
“Truant Surgeon” and Mr Ellis’s two
books (should one say his two other
books?) that Mr Bruce was a sort of
Man Friday to Dr Page’s Crusoe. What
these claims amount to, and so far
people on the scene at the time haven’t
challenged them, is that the Financial
Agreement, the Australian Loan Coun-
cil, the National Debt Sinking Fund,
the Federal Aid Roads Scheme and the
Australian Agricultural Council are the
practically unaided work of Sir Earle.
If so, the claims of those who regard
him as the statesman of the first half-
century are credible. It is certainly in-
disputable that in his last portfolio, as
Minister for Health in the Menzies
Government, by producing solo the
National Health Scheme inaugurated in
1950 he had an individual triumph in a
field strewn with lamentable failures.
It was due not to Page himself but
to the Country Party, that Lord Bruce
was able to make his entry into
national politics—under an agreement to
introduce preferential voting. Perhaps the
key to the Country Party's survival is in
the preferential system of voting which
it pressurised through in the war period.
Hughes, doubtless instinctively, refused
to be persuaded.
It all blew up during one of his
absences, when in April, 1918, the con-
servative member for Flinders resigned
to become Chief Justice of Victoria.
The Country Party organisation of the
day (there was no Australian Country
Party then) nominated J. J. Hall against
Mr Bruce and the Labor candidate. Two
days before the poll, at the instance of
Acting Prime Minister W. A. Watt, the
Federal Nationalists agreed that legisla-
tion for preferential voting would be
considered.
Although it was too late to withdraw
their horse the Country Party thereupon
ran him dead, and Bruce romped home.
“In one stroke, therefore (says Mr Ellis),
the Country Party had achieved a major
policy objective and found a substitute
for Hughes who, as Prime Minister, was
a target for their sharpest darts.”
Later it was itself to provide two
Prime Ministers, and currently a poten-
tial third.

A agreeable light reading.
Armand Denis has become famous
for his films on wild life. In his auto-
biography he writes that his first active
interest in animals began at the age
of three when his mother found him
breeding flies in a matchbox.
He regards his TV films as most valu-
able propaganda in his mission to pre-
vent destruction of wild life for com-
mercial gain or pleasure. Denis came to
Australia first in 1952 to make a film
on crocodile hunting in Northern
Queensland, then went on to New
Guinea, whose people he found the most
fascinating part of the journey to the
Antipodes. Africa has always been his
real love. He and his wife Michaela have
now built a permanent home in Kenya,
from which they set out on their regular
filming expeditions.
Alistair Mac Lean’s new thriller is
slow-starting, tending in the first chapters
to bog down in a lot of irritating “smart-
aleck” back-chat. But when the pace
does quicken, the story lives up to his
reputation for high suspense and in-
genious inventiveness.
Author von Konrat’s pre-war experi-
ence as a deep-sea diver led to his be-
coming a saboteur in Hitler’s army,
and his knack for languages qualified
him for work among the enemy. With
200 others he was landed secretly at
Sevastopol during its siege to blow up
vital installations. He passed himself off
as Russian, was able to carry out his
work which hastened the downfall of
the city, but had trouble convincing the
oncoming Germans that he was one of
them.
This is an incredible war-and-after
story, which perhaps could not safely
have been published before now. There
is no mention of a translator. If this is
Mr von Konrat’s own lucid and witty
English, he certainly does have an extra-
ordinary knack for language
Mrs Lubbock came to Australia to
visit her daughter, married and living
on a property near Cootamundra in New
South Wales. Soon after her arrival she
bought a car and set off alone to see
the country. Trips to Broken Hill, In-
verell, to Bourke and “back of,” Light-
ning Ridge where she gouged for opals,
and the Dead Heart, Tasmania, and the
Tropical North, to which she travelled
by boat, are described.
Detail of country and city life has
been recorded in a most observant and
careful way. And she does show a real
flair for recapturing the vernacular,
making such characters as Fixer Miller,
outback undertaker and odd-job car-
penter, encountered in the bar of a bush
hotel, come amusingly and convincingly
to life.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Freight Rise Darkens Export Picture
The Australian export scene is not as rosy and free from
early disturbance as it might appear. Exporters of both
primary and manufactured products are already getting
nervous about a practically certain increase in freight rates
between Australia and British-Continental ports which could
occur before the end of this year.
A fair measure of stability (illustrated by the accompanying
graph) has prevailed through two full export seasons as a
result of the “stand-still” arrangement negotiated with over-
seas shipowners in March,
1962. The first agreements
making up that arrangement
begin to expire in September
next.
More than a premonition of
an upward move in ex-Australia
freights is suggested by an
approximate 7i p.c. rise in ex-
Britain rates to take effect from
March. Local authorities do not
feel convinced that production
costs have actually gone up by
this amount, though they believe
the English shipping companies
are keeping a safe eye on a
probable advance in seamen’s
wages as well.
They therefore regard a
parallel Australia-Britain rise as
almost automatic but hope it
may be held below 1\ p.c.
With all these alarums about,
it’s no wonder that exporters,
by way of their Australian
Manufacturers’ Export Council,
want more teeth put into the

Pty Ltd and Overseas Shipping Representatives’ Association.
Federal Exporters’ Oversea Transport Committee (FEOTC),
enabling this body to discuss freight rates with all overseas
shipowners.
Australia's relative impotence on outside shipping matters
was shown again last year when North American rates were
jumped by 10 p.c. solely on the ukase of the shipowners
concerned and without prior consultation.
FEOTC’s present powers extend only to discussing export
rates with the British and European Conference of Shipping
Lines, represented in Australia by the Oversea Shipping
Representatives’ Association. The two bodies meet on the
Australian Oversea Transport Association, which was
established under Federal Government sponsorship in 1930.
The association allows consultation on transport affairs
with the main British, Danish, Dutch, French, German,
Italian, Norwegian and Swedish shipping groups. On the
increasingly important North American and Asian routes,
Australia is still largely at the mercy of individual shipping
companies.
There is little doubt, even in the more rationalised European
orbit, who can call most of the tune. And any wholly-
owned Australian line could scarcely start to resolve the
advantages possessed by the foreign shipping “monopoly”.
The ANZ Bank’s Quarterly Survey has recently explained
the reason very succinctly. “Australian operating costs, how-
ever, mean that Australian ships
have little prospect of participa-
tion in overseas trading, because
of the higher wages which must
be paid and the amenities which
must be made available to Aus-
tralian seamen on Australian
ships, as against ships registered
overseas and manned by
foreign labor.”
So a heavy drain of “in-
visibles” appears to be part of
the natural order for Australian
exporters. Nevertheless, the
benefits of the 1962 “stand-still”
display what negotiation can
accomplish. They provide suf-
ficient evidence to justify any
attempt to widen the range of
FEOTC, if more overseas
shippers will come to the party.
To cap the manufacturers’
problems, purely coastal freight
rates may have to rise for the
first time since 1958. Coastal
ships now handle only about 5
p.c. of domestic cargo tonnage,
though the introduction of bulkships and “containerised”
cargo is giving them a new lease of life.
UK Shipping Gets
New Impetus
Crop failures in Europe and China not only helped to boost
world commodity prices but gave a tremendous boost
to the shipping industry. While the US argued about the
freight rates it was going to charge Russia for the shipment
of wheat, other shipping nations were cashing in on the sudden
demand for freights. As a result, tramp shipping companies
(already helped by a general increase in seaborne trade in
1963) reported that tramp freights in December were at their
best level since 1957.


Shipbuilders in Britain in 1963 obtained new orders for 11
million gross tons, helped by the UK Government’s £stg7s
million credit scheme for British shipowners who ordered from
British shipyards.
Estimates of the effect of the new credit scheme indicate
that possibly 600,000 tons of new orders were prompted by
the new source of credit, but there also was a normal revival
in shipbuilding demand which accounted for 900,000 tons,
including 250,000 tons for export. Allowing for the fact that
about one million tons is required as normal annual replace-
ment, the current upsurge in shipbuilding demand in Britain is
a complete reversal of the slump which existed a year ago.
Critics point to the fact that Japanese shipbuilders can still
build a ship about 20 p.c. cheaper than British yards. But
with the rising wage and cost structure in Japan, this margin
could be whittled down.
A recent UK survey indicated that British shipyards could
become far more efficient in their costing, because the direct
labor content represents only about 17 p.c. British yards are
hampered because they grow like Topsy. They are less effici-
ent. than some of the more modern European or Japanese
yards because of choking restrictions caused by a maze of
railway tracks, ancient roads and shallow waterways. But
supporters of the industry who would like to see a continuation
of UK shipbuilding revival say there is no reason why eco-
nomies cannot be achieved in the supply of equipment outside
the actual shipbuilding process.
Tramp shippers report that the world tonnage of idle ship-
ping laid up has dwindled from 41m. tons to around lim.
tons, most of which is obsolete. Many ships currently pressed
into service will become obsolete within a short period (parti-
cularly if freights fall again) so there is plenty of encourage-
ment for building the new and economic super-tankers which
have made such an impact in bulk freighting, particularly in
the oil trade.
There is no doubting the UK fleet of shipping has lost
ground to the US, France, Italy and Japan, whose combined
tonnage (nationally subsidised) has jumped by 40 p.c. since
before World War 11. New prestige fleets also have been
built up by other nations under heavy government subsidies.
But subsidies and convenient flag registration in Liberia,
Greece, Panama and Lebanon are not the only reason for the
decline in British shipping, because the Scandinavian countries
managed to outstrip Britain in shipping growth without the
benefit of heavy government subsidies.
The current forward-looking programme in Britain must
emphasise economies, efficiency and a reliance on the big
bulk carrier. But it is claimed there is still a great need for
aggressive competition, which seems to be inhibited by the pro-
tective conference line system. This establishes agreed freight
rates and tends to avoid competition in any route already
served by another British line.
Because of the need for heavy capital investment in new
ships, it is being suggested that the British shipowners’ logical
method of achieving economy is to amalgamate wherever
convenient.
Copper Prices Break Out
of Support Clamps
two years or so of astonishingly rigid stability, spot
copper prices recently started to oscillate upwards on the
London Metal Exchange. Nothing like the ebullience of lead,
zinc and tin could ever have been expected, but the main
Rhodesian producers were not long in calling the market to
order again.
They had eminently succeeded in imposing, by support, a
firm floor at £stg234 a ton for contract wire bars. Exhaustion
of stocks bought for this support quickly lifted the clamps and
rates sped as high as £stg23B 10s.
Now Anglo American and Rhodesian Selection Trust, the
two principal Rhodesian miners, have decided to sell at the
LME price or £stg236 a ton.
Despite a well proven ability to control the market,
producers have to watch a fairly abundant world supply very
carefully. Though consumption generally is going ahead,
substitute materials offer a clear temptation at too high prices.
The Rhodesians now impose no limits on output or sales.
They certainly expect a livelier demand, yet it hardly seems
possible that the old stability can be easily regained. London
may continue to react to the immediate lack of stock.
Australia’s domestic production is assisted by a bounty which
vanishes if the overseas price reaches £stg26o a ton or more.
Imports are dutiable when the overseas price falls under
£stg232 a ton.
Australian Banks Join
Computer Revolution
XpLECTRONic banking is now well on the way in Australia.
Both the Bank of New South Wales (in Sydney) and the
ANZ Bank (in Melbourne) expect to embark upon the “com-
puterisation” of trading bank operations this year.
The ANZ has sounded fairly reticent of details since the
initial announcement in 1963, but the Wales was quite expan-
sive about plans last week. If it gets first into the field, that will
be a reward for several years of close research and investi-
gation.
Adaptation of computer techniques to banking has not
proved particularly easy anywhere in the world, especially
on routines dominated by cheques. A cheque’s information,
conveyed in a multitude of handwritings and personal idio-
syncrasies, must be translated into “machine language” and
also standardised to a given banking system.
The Wales’ general manager, Mr R. J. Abercrombie, was
careful to explain that the lines taken by his bank would
“permit us fully to integrate our techniques with those of
other trading banks when they adopt electronic accounting.”
It is not merely an affair of substituting machines for clerks.
Indeed, employees hitherto absorbed on procedural duties like
ledger machining and voucher handling can be more valuably
used elsewhere in the bank.
As with many other computer developments throughout
commerce and industry, no retrenchment is called for. Speeding
the processes does, however, help to contain costs.
What technically permits the extension of automation to
cheque and voucher sorting is the encoding of identifying
symbols on to cheques and vouchers in a magnetic ink.
“Magnetic Ink Character Recognition” (MICR) then enables a
computor to classify cheques from coded information covering
customer, bank and branch.
The Wales’ General Electric 225 computer, with ancillary
sorting equipment, will bring about 170 Sydney-area branches
fully into its system and some 200 others partially. It will
centralise the branch ledgers and also print customer state-
ments. At full speed the computer can cope with 500,000
debits and credits a day.
Total outlay for the Wales’ first centre in Sydney will be
nearly £1 million. Other capital cities and centres in Australia
and New Zealand are eventually to move into electronic data
processing.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Queensland as a Case Study
(The last of a series of four articles on the Stanford Research Institute’s
survey , “The Development of Australia”)
After outlining the elements of
development required for integrated
regional development, including those of
an adequate infrastructure, resources
development, industrial manufacture and
market outlets, the Stanford survey
chose two under-developed regions as
examples of sectors of Australia offering
huge possibilities—the north of Western
Australia and Queensland. Only the
latter will be considered in this article.
Much of the interior of Queensland
is suitable only for pastoral industry,
and particularly for cattle raising, says
the Stanford survey, but what makes
regional development promising is the
mineral wealth of the State. The long-
established silver-lead-zinc ores of Mt Isa
are now overshadowed by copper. The
deposits of bauxite are perhaps the
largest in the world. New accessible and
thick seams of black coal have recently
been discovered. Natural gas has long
been used locally at Roma and the only
commercial oil field yet discovered in
Australia is at Moonie.
The survey suggests that the focus of
a regional development plan for Queens-
land could be the creation of a statutory
authority, modelled largely upon the
Snowy Mountains Authority, to control
the water resources of the Fitzroy River
basin, including the Isaacs and Dawson
rivers which unite to form the Fitzroy,
and possibly the waters of the Burdekin
River system to the north.
HThe main reasons for suggesting these
-*■ water developments are that they
would form a natural extension of the
electricity grid from Brisbane, which
lies 400 miles to the south; that there
is good land in the brigalow which can
be linked with the pastoral country
further west by using irrigated pasture
to fatten store cattle; and that the re-
duction of the Weipa bauxite to alumina
will be undertaken at Gladstone with
power from a thermal generating station
using the newly discovered Moura-
Kianga coal.
This location of a major industrial
enterprise in the region is likely to attract
related industries, says the survey. A
plan to control the periodic flooding of
the rivers, to divert the water for
irrigation of the brigalow lands and to
provide supplementary power (which
could cheapen the cost of thermal
generation by taking the peak load)
would give a great impetus to develop-
ment.
The creation of a statutory authority
with the specific task of developing and
controlling the water of the Fitzroy and
Burdekin basins is conceived as the
nucleus of a development programme
for Queensland as a whole. The first
stage in such a programme, already
begun, is an inventory of resources —
including minerals, surface and under-
ground water, soil analyses and geologic
and topographic siting of power plants
and storage dams. This inventory should
be correlated with a survey of existing
road, rail, power, water, and port
facilities, and the construction needed to
supplement them.
/Ybviously, says the survey, there are
” other areas of Queensland where de-
velopment is also likely to be feasible.
The oil discovery at Moonie, in the Surat
Basin, and the pipeline under con-
struction to Brisbane, where two new
refineries are being built, have already
stimulated employment. If more oil is
found this stimulus will be multiplied.
The natural gas field which has been
used for many years at Roma should
be thoroughly investigated to determine
its extent and potential. New Common-
wealth highways and railways could
facilitate movement of cattle from the
inland pastoral areas.
Further north, behind Townsville,
there is already developing a series of
water and power development schemes;
but further action is necessary to control
the coastal rivers, to construct high-level
bridges, and to integrate the agricultural
development of the Atherton Tableland
with the pastoral country further to the
north.
Queensland already grows cotton, but
irrigation would seem to be necessary
to produce good quality cotton by the
methods pursued in Texas and California,
which are now the leading producers
of cotton in the United States Tobacco,
maize, and many other crops can be
grown in this fertile area.
In the back country, the survey
observes, there are vast mineral deposits,
many of them just beginning to be
exploited or still lying unused. Mt Isa,
600 miles inland, is responsible for much
of the recent growth of Townsville. The
bauxite of Weipa will be carried around
Cape York to Gladstone for reduction
to alumina. But there is also iron in
the Constance Ranges and a great
stretch of pastoral country in the Gulf
region could be greatly benefited if
certain road and rail connections were
supplemented by access roads.
Queensland is closer than any other
State to the phosphate deposits of Nauru
and Ocean Islands. It is also a natural
point of departure for the growing
markets in Japan and the West Coast of
the United States, and very close also
to South and South-east Asia. With
copper, lead, silver, zinc, coal, iron,
uranium, manganese; tin, rutile, oil, and
gas, and the largest deposits of bauxite
in the world, Queensland can look
forward to development of manu-
facturing industries on a large scale.
It also has a unique tourist attraction,
still little developed, in its tropical coast-
line and islands, with the Great Barrier
Reef extending for hundreds of miles
offshore. To develop the tourist traffic,
more hotels and better transport facilities
are required. The tourist traffic across
the Pacific through the Pacific Islands
could produce a considerable contribu-
tion towards the external balance of
payments.
Enumerating these resources, the
survey says that the very large deposits
of bauxite proved at Weipa on the
York Peninsula are the largest high
grade bauxite yet known to exist in the
world.
On coal, it says that one of the great
mines of the Southern Hemisphere is
likely to develop in the 350-square-mile
Kianga-Moura coalfields, 100 miles
south-west of Gladstone. The Peabody
Coal Co. of Missouri with Thiess Bros
Pty Ltd of Australia have a franchise
to develop for export large quantities of
coking coal. Mitsui and Co. Ltd, Japan,
has joined the group and acquired a 20
p.c. interest. A firm order is reported of
2.4 m. tons to be shipped to Japan over
the next three years and of a second
order for 3.4 m. tons to be shipped over
a seven-year period.
iron, “immense” iron ore deposits
are reported in the Constance Range,
120 miles from the Gulf of Carpentaria
along the border of Northern Queens-
land and the Northern Territory, but no
estimates of the quantity of ore available
have been released. Since most of the
ore is reported to lie in Queensland a
beneficiation plant could presumably be
built within the State. There are
problems of underground water, trans-
port, harbors, and markets. If a tech-
nical and economic analysis should prove
the project feasible, an integrated iron-
steel plant in the Gladstone area using
the Moura-Kianga coal would seem to
be a possibility.
The survey goes on to show that

—Development Finance Corporation Limited —reviews monthly
the investment portfolio to attain our objectives of capital growth
combined with the security offered by a diversified portfolio.
Although investment opportunities arising from daily market
price fluctuations are not ignored, portfolio operations of the
Delfin Fund are more importantly motivated by long-term
economic considerations. Your Board has a continuing task of
analysing the economic and social forces which are already
creating tomorrow’s investment opportunities. In this way we
hope to select those industries and companies that we believe
will grow at a faster rate than the overall economy.
It is gratifying to note that during the past twelve months the
Fund has benefited by no less than fourteen companies in our
portfolio making bonus issues, seventeen companies making
rights issues and a further three companies are currently subject
to take-over offers which, if concluded, will improve the capital
value of the Fund.
Earnings per share have shown a steady growth as indicated
below:
Six months ended 30th April, 1962 .816 pence
31st October, 1962 .911 pence
30th April, 1963 .936 pence
31st October, 1963 1.102 pence
Since the last report to Shareholders the net asset backing per
share based on the market value of your Fund’s portfolio has
improved from 4/8. 9d. to 5/1. 3d. The Fund’s investment port-
folio reflects our belief that if we were to seek higher dividend
income we would risk sacrificing the growth characteristics
which are so important to your investment. As stated previously,
this investment approach, is, in our opinion, in your best interests
as Shareholders.
GENERAL
During the past two years, investors in the more speculative
stocks have suffered substantial capital losses and unfortunately
in some instances such losses are of a permanent nature.
Your Fund was not designed for the speculator but to meet the
needs of the genuine investor and its performance during the
difficult period emphasises the value of a managed diversified
portfolio.
With the greatly improved economic conditions now existing in
Australia 1 look forward with confidence to our continued
growth over the years. The present high level of liquidity arising
in some measure from the improvement in world prices of our
primary products could be expected in due course to produce
higher levels of equity shares generally and the sound holdings
of your Fund should show a corresponding improvement in
value. I believe that you will find the Delfin Fund to be a
rewarding long-term investment.
Please do not hesitate to write if you have any queries regarding
your Fund, but I suggest that its diversified portfolio represented
by a single security, its assured marketability with complete
management being provided at an annual fee of only ten shillings
for each £lOO investment, represent excellent value to the
genuine investor in Australia’s growth potential.
Yours
thfully,
(JOHN H. MARKS)
Chairman of Directors

Highlights from the Chairman's Address to Shareholders
Mr. Leslie J. Thompson in his Address to Shareholders at the 52nd Annual
Meeting revised the operations for the year. The following highlights are
taken from his Address and Statement of Accounts.
CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS
Total assets of the group of A.P.A. Companies now total £30,565,726
at book value, with market value greatly in excess of this figure.
SUM ASSURED IN FORCE
Sum Assured in Force including bonus additions now totals £39,957,000.
INCREASED BENEFITS TO POLICYHOLDERS
£361,085 was allocated for reversionary bonuses to policyholders. £29
per £lOOO Sum Assured was the rate of Bonus declared for the main
Whole of Life Tables.
ANNUAL INCOME
The gross annual income from Life and Accident Premiums and the
investment of Life Funds and Reserves now exceeds £2,150,000.
INTEREST YIELD
The net effective rate of interest (i.e., after deducting income tax)
earned on the Assurance Funds including Reserves was £5/9/9%
compared with £5/8/4% in 1962 and £5/6/9% in 1961.
RATE OF PROGRESS
Assets, Reserves and Life Assurance Funds, Sum Assured and Annual
Income have doubled in the period of the last seven to eight years.
ACCIDENT DEPARTMENT
Personal Accident and Sickness premium income again increased. The
steady rate of growth in this section has continued.
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
A.P.A. NOMINEES LTD. had another successful year. This Company acts
as Trustee in a number of public company issues of debentures and notes,
and also acts as Superannuation Fund Custodian.
A.P.A. FIRE & GENERAL INSURANCE CO. LTD. showed satisfactory
progress and increased premium income.
FIRST FEDERAL DISCOUNT CO. LTD.— authorised dealer Australian
Official Short Term Money Market, kept its portfolio of Government Stocks
fully employed during the year in acceptance of deposit monies from its
large clientele of companies, firms and individuals all over Australia.
A.P.A. DISCOUNT CORPORATION LIMITED authorised dealer New
Zealand Official Short Term Money Market, operated profitably during the
year. This Company has established Offices in Auckland, Wellington and
Christchurch.
manganese, of importance to the iron-
steel industry, exists at the headwaters
of Mary Creek, and that Queensland tin
accounts for one-third of the Australian
production. Rutile is also available in
large quantities.
Both agriculture and pastoral in-
dustries are well established in Queens-
land, but both can expand significantly
with an integrated programme to provide
irrigation and flood control, transport,
and the development of unused lands.
Cane farming now extends along 1,300
miles of coastline from the NSW border
to Cairns, where it benefits from high
summer rainfall.
Sugar competes with wool as the most
valuable crop. In 1960-61, 327,000 acres
of cane were cut, yielding £47m. which
represented nearly half of the total value
of Queensland’s agricultural production.
About 95 p.c. of Australia’s sugar
output comes from Queensland and is
processed by its 31 mills. Concern is
felt in the valuable cane lands of the
Lower Burdekin Valley over diminished
supplies of fresh water and salt
intrusion.
Some cotton is grown, but less than
10 p.c. of Australia’s requirements
is produced domestically, though the
Commonwealth has guaranteed a price
of 14d. per pound of lint. A gin now
exists in Brisbane, and with sufficient
irrigated land, Queensland might become
a major cotton-producing area.
Queensland produces half of the
tobacco grown in Australia, and with
irrigated land could grow more.
More beef is produced in Queensland
than in any other State in Australia and
about 46 p.c. of total beef cattle are
raised here. In 1961 it accounted for
75 p.c. of the total beef exports with
a value of £36m. One sixth of the
country’s sheep are also in Queensland.
Wool sales were £.53.8m. in 1960-61.
With irrigated pastures in Central
Queensland far more beef can be
produced and more sheep grazed, the
survey states. New beef roads will in-
crease the stocking through permitting
earlier sale and will also permit a con-
tinuous flow of stock to the abattoirs
throughout the year.
Originally the “brigalow” represented
about 12.3 m. acres, but one-third of it
has been cleared. The remaining Bm.
acres is regarded as the largest un-
developed agricultural resource in
eastern Australia. Research has estab-
lished methods for effective clearing and
has demonstrated how the land can be
used for improved pastures, cash crops,
and supplementary fodder crops. With
improved pastures the carrying capacity
of the land can be increased sevenfold,
it is claimed.


Why Indonesia Opposes Malaysia
And yet " suffers five times more than Singapore ”
From ALEX JOSEY
7-hat is at stake is not just 8.7
p.c. of our national income,
but literally our survival as a
separate people in this part of the world.”
This is how Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Singapore’s Prime Minister, saw Indo-
nesia’s “confrontation”. He was speak-
ing in the Assembly after the arrest in
Singapore of five Indonesian saboteurs
and 19 fifth-columnists, and the dis-
covery of a quantity of arms and ex-
plosives.
The agents and spies had been
trained on the Indonesian island of
Pulau Sekupang, a few miles south of
Singapore in the Riouw Archipelago.
They had been instructed to sabotage
petrol dumps, railway lines, water works
and power stations. Explosives and
weapons were found behind a mosque
and at other places including a hedge
near the Chief Justice’s residence. One
of the Indonesians arrested was a
former Indonesian Consulate official in
Singapore.
Mr Lee said that the fact that Indo-
nesia w'as now prepared to use agents
and fifth-columnists to disrupt Singa-
pore's economy put a sombre hue on the
Government’s responsibilities. “We are,”
he said, “now in the midst of a battle
for life or death, a battle for survival,
our survival as a separate entity to live
our lives in our ow'n way in South-East
Asia unmolested by bigger and more
powerful neighbors.”
Mr Lee said that Singapore's chances
of survival were ten times better in
Malaysia than if they were on their
own. He spoke of a “conscious act”
of Indonesia to inflict damage on
Malaysia, by economic sanction “even if
it cost Indonesia four times our losses”,
by military pressure on Malaysia’s
borders and sabotage from w'ithin. If
it appeared to have a chance of success,
“direct military action could not alto-
gether be ruled out"’.
Mr Lee warned that if ever the Com-
munists in Malaysia succeeded in weak-
ening “our resolve” for Malaysia then
“verily first Sarawak, then Sabah, then
Singapore, and finally Malaya itself will
be slowly absorbed into the Indonesian
orbit”. If this happened then even the
Opposition, the Barisan Sosialis, which
the Prime Minister said was a Com-
munist front organisation, “may look
back to this era as a golden age”.
Mr Lee said it was now evident that,
months before Malaysia was mooted, the
Indonesians had launched a scheme
gradually to absorb Singapore and
Malaya.
Economically, Indonesia’s trade boy-
cott is expected to cost Singapore about
SM2O9 million a year. This amounts to
8.7 p.c. of the State's national income,
and is, in the words of the Finance
Minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, “a severe
blow' 5 . It is no use for anyone to pre-
tend it is a “trivial matter”. Yet it is
not crippling. In the past three years,
Singapore’s national income has in-
creased by SMSOO million, and the
SM2OO million direct loss caused by
LEE KUAN YEW
Singapore’s Prime Minister
Indonesia’s trade suspension means that
if Singapore can sustain, in other sectors
of the economy, the rate of growth of
the past three years, it could make good
the losses in something like two years.
In other words, Indonesia’s economic
confrontation has set back Singapore’s
timetable by two years. Certain social
projects, such as free secondary school-
ing, will be held up, but industrialisation
is expected to forge ahead. Dr Goh
pointed to Hong Kong’s sensational
development, and to Australia's rapid
progress, as an indication of W'hat could
be done.
Indonesia’s “economic disarray”, as
Dr Goh put it, w'as suspected to be
much more serious. Business circles in
Singapore say that Indonesia is suffering
five times as much as Singapore, and
can afford it ten times less. Indonesia’s
foreign exchange earnings, already in a
precarious state, are being still further
reduced; on the black market the rupiah
is worth even less.
Withdrawal of Singapore-based ships
from Indonesian waters has caused a
severe dislocation in the Indonesian
transportation system, and this means a
great deal in a republic with 1000 in-
habited islands.
All this has resulted in an accumula-
tion of raw materials at Indonesian
ports, and an acute shortage of rice and
other imported consumer goods. Indo-
nesia, now the world’s largest importer
of rice, buys about a million tons a
year, and much of it is carried in Singa-
pore's ships.
Apart from Singapore’s loss of earn-
ings and a reduction in the national
income, the employment situation in
Singapore has also been affected. Some
8200 workers directly affected by cutting
off supplies of rubber and other produce
and the laying up of ships may eventu-
ally lose their jobs.
The new economic defence law in-
volving the direction of employment is
a novelty in Singapore, and Dr Goh has
promised that the Government will take
the “utmost care” in implementing the
law to ensure that the industries absorb-
ing the workers will not be injured, or
rendered inefficient by having to employ
an unsuitable working force.
These measures were designed to pro-
tect the workers. Dr Goh has already
discussed with the State’s powerful
Economic Development Board the ques-
tion of also looking after the interests of
businessmen affected by Indonesia’s
confrontation. He said that special
arrangements will be made to make it
easy for owmers and management to
gain entry into the new industries now
being planned for Singapore.
The plan has three aspects. The first
covers equity participation in certain
large industrial enterprises which have
been planned by the Economic Develop-
ment Board, and are in various stages
of implementation. They include a sugar
refinery, a fertiliser plant, a solvent ex-
traction plant, an iron ore loading
terminal and beneficiation plant, a grain
silo operation and the Jurong shipyard.
Total share capital in these projects
exceeds SM6S million. A portion of the
share capital w'ill be reserved for owners
of establishments affected by confronta-
tion. The Economic Development Board

will be a direct participant in these
enterprises.
The second aspect of the scheme
covers a number of small, promising
industries, which include a bicycle
assembly and manufacturing plant, a
fruit juice cannery, meat processing,
manufacture of preserved ginger, mos-
quito coils, building hardware, lire-
crackers, plastics, automobile com-
ponents, and others. In most cases,
the capital investment ranges from
$M 100,000 to $M500,000. The Econo-
mic Development Board would provide

dustrial enterprises, and to promote new
industries. Technical assistance will be
provided by the Economic Development
Board.
Dr Goh recalled that just over 12
years ago Hong Kong experienced a
similar need to reorientate her economy
from a purely trading port to an in-
dustrial economy. The success which
Hong Kong achieved in effecting this
change has been spectacular, and there
is no reason why Singapore, with the
advantage of a protected Malaysian
common market, could not do even
better.
“Singapore businessmen now affected
by confrontation are in a better position
than their Hong Kong counterparts were
a decade ago,” said Dr Goh. “They
have the advantage of positive Govern-
ment assistance and the services of an
effective industrial promotion agency.”
Dr Goh said that what the Indo-
nesians had done amounted to waging
economic war on Malaysia. Singapore
could not watch passively any action
undertaken by any foreign country which
directly assisted Indonesia in “pursuing
her policy of confrontation to our detri-
ment.”
Singapore is a free and open market
to all the industrial countries of the
world. Large industrial countries have
an export market in Singapore worth
SM3OO million a year. Even a small
country like Holland has an export
market here of SM7O million a year.
The Malaysian market is more than
twice these figures.
Dr Goh reminded that any profit
which foreign businessmen hoped to
obtain by assisting Indonesia, either by
supplying ships or by direct purchases
of rubber and other tropical produce, and
by managerial and technical assistance
to achieve these ends, could only be
marginal.
Dr Goh warned that “these countries
will do well to balance the possible
profits from hazarding into Indonesia
against the earnings they now enjoy
from the export market here. They
should not sacrifice a bird in the hand
for one in the bush.”
Dr Goh said that any country which,
enjoying a thriving export market in
Singapore, went out of its way to assist
Indonesia in its economic confrontation
of Malaysia would find Singapore mar-
kets closed to their exports.
Nobody in Malaysia believes that
Indonesia can seriously damage the
Malaysian economy permanently. In
Indonesia, conditions are almost certain
to worsen. Indonesia’s military pressure
most likely will increase, frontier clashes
continue, and saboteurs still sneak in.
But I doubt if President Soekarno will
be mad enough to try open invasion.
Neither militarily, nor economically,
therefore, is Malaysia in grave danger.
Nonetheless, all Malaysians would much
prefer normal diplomatic and trading
relations with her large neighbor.

Customlife is increasing
this man’s life assurance policy
That’s what we mean by “Guaranteed Insurability”!
Four years ago, at age 36, this
man took out a Customlife policy,
with guaranteed insurability.
Today, although stricken with a
heart attack, he is exercising his
option to increase his cover by
£5,600 —*the amount of his
original insurance.
It is granted without question.
Without penalty rate.
This option is possible through
our “Guaranteed Insurability”
plan. Briefly, it guarantees you
the right to increase your life
assurance cover periodically with-
out the need for further medical
examination —regardless of the
state of your health at any 5f the
pption datgs.
Customlife realises that one cannot
depend on constant good health, and,
realising this, provides for your
in the event of any illness at any time.
Let's look at specifics:
From birth to age 40, it is possible for
you to increase the cover on your life
five times. Option dates exist at ages 24,
28, 32, 36 and 40 to increase cover by
an amount not exceeding the original sum
assured . . . which can be up to £5,000.
Thus, taking advantage of all options,
you have a maximum amount purchas-
able of £30,000, with only the one
medical examination when the initial
policy is taken out.
Even if you should delay to, say, age 35,
you still have two further option dates.
Perhaps you are thirty now; you have a
young family and a responsibility for
their future and your own. You can
take out an initial policy for any amount
up to £5,000, and increase it as you will
at the option dates, with no fear of
refusal on medical grounds.
The coverage, of course, applies to
women, too. The same complete protec-
tion applies to you as a career woman,
or a young wife sharing family responsi-
bilities.
This is worry-free security, enabling you
to plan for the future with a new
confidence.
You can have more specific details of
this Life Assurance plan by contacting
your nearest Customlife office (listed
below). If you have delayed buying life
assurance, this may be the wisest time for
you to move. Customlife will tailor a
policy to your requirements immediately.

RMC Dodges More Bricks
TAirectors of Ready Mixed Concrete
doubtless are a bit confused by
criticisms of their proposed entry into
the sub-underwriting and merchant
banking business through the formation
of a £2.4m. offshoot, RMC Under-
writing & Development Ltd, in which
Ready Mixed Concrete will hold a 50
p.c. capital interest.
Although feeling justifiably proud of
their success in achieving a £sm.
capital profit on the sale of the UK sub-
sidiary, they perhaps are a little injured
at suggestions that their expertise is
open to doubt in a field where others
have failed. Perhaps they may not have
analysed too closely the relatively poor
performance of some of the less success-
ful competitors in the merchant banking
business. But they indicate they have
no illusions when they say that only
moderate dividends can be expected
from the new venture in the early years.
In fact, they put a figure of 4 p.c. on
dividend prospects when analysing
future returns.
This is an interesting exercise, because
RMC’s announcement to shareholders
compares current dividends of RMC at
12i p.c. with future prospects of 16j
p.c. on reduced capital of 3s. 6d. plus
a 4 p.c. return on the one-for-20 new
issue of 10s. shares in the new offshoot.
In terms of money, RMC anticipates
that holders of 1000 ss. stock units in
RMC now receiving £3l ss. in dividends
will end up with dividends of £3O 3s. 4d.
on their future holdings, after deducting
the Is. in cash returned to stockholders
when capital is reduced.
Stockholders may even use this Is. a
share to apply for more shares in RMC
Underwriting & Development Ltd.
In terms of dividend liability, RMC
will be better off, yet gaining an oppor-
tunity to achieve a handsome capital
profit on its subsidiary if the project is
successful.
A big factor behind all this, of course,
is the backing from J. B. Were & Son,
the powerful Melbourne broking firm
which can put many juicy plums in the
way of RMC Underwriting if it wants to.
Inevitably there will be stockholders
who would prefer to see a full return
of the £sm. in booty from the sale of
the UK subsidiary. Pointing to the
results of the J. B. Were group of in-
vestment companies, they may prefer to
do their own investing.
RMC directors need not be straying
too far away from the parent company’s
current interests. Their description of
the proposed activities of RMC Under-
writing mentions the “financing of com-
mercial transactions for the Readymix
Group as a whole”.
Already the Readymix group in-
cludes a wide variety of activities, such
as dairying, distribution of Mercedes
Benz and Rolls Royce passenger vehicles,
truck builders, plant hire service and
even tin mining in Malaysia.
There is plenty of scope for using
funds here, including finance for stock-
holders who would like to buy a Rolls
Royce on credit after using their Is.
return of capital as a deposit.
A big question, of course, is the cost
of administering the new underwriting
and investment house, including the ex-
pensive share transfer department. Pre-
sumably RMC will achieve economies
by combining the new share registry
with its existing transfer department.
Also, presumably, Mrs Richards will be
secretary of both companies, thus saving
any extra expense.
An immediate problem for stock-
holders is the awkward ratio of shares
to be offered in the new company. A
one-for-20 ratio means that it is neces-
sary to hold 2000 RMC shares before
receiving a neat parcel of 100 10s.
shares in the new company.
The odd lots specialist who handles
the buying and selling of the odd parcels,
either in Sydney or Melbourne, should
be in a happy position because he is
permitted a handsome margin each way.
Perhaps RMC's offshoot could make its
first profit by buying out the odd lots
brokers in Sydney and Melbourne.
Of more immediate investment in-
terest to the market is the fact that, after
reducing RMC shares to 3s. 6d. par
value, the anticipated future dividends
of 16j p.c. would provide a dividend
yield of more than 8 p.c. on recent
market prices of around 11s. Bd. (less
Is. 6d. returned). Considering the low
yields once accepted from this stock
when the general market was nowhere
near its present peak, the income return
is most attractive even after averaging
out the 6d. a share tied up in the new
offshoot.
Ampol for the Tax Conscious
Investors in a high tax bracket but
looking for a good income return a
few years hence should not overlook
Ampol’s deferred shares.
And the ones with the most appeal
are the partly-paids. At present the
fully-paid deferreds bring Bs. Id., while
the contribs, paid to 2s. with 3s. due in
a final payment on March 31, bring
ss. Id.
The market assumes that Ampol’s
dividend will be no higher than 14 p.c.
per annum in the interval before the
deferreds rank for dividend after June
30, 1967. So the price margin between
ordinaries and deferreds at the present
time should be little more than 2s. Id.
Yet the ordinaries are currently valued
on the market at 3s. 6d. higher than the
deferreds —at 11s. 7d. where the yield
is still an attractive 6 p.c.
Instead of taxable income, investors
should expect tax-free capital apprecia-
tion from the deferreds.
Other than deferment of dividends for
the next three years the deferreds rank
equally in every respect with ordinaries.
A larger equity (in terms of capital
outlay) can be obtained in Ampol by
buying the deferreds, and if necessary
the holding can be trimmed later.


Is Mar chants Going Flat?
£500,000 sunk in screw-top bottles
rpuE severe reduction in television and
-*■ radio advertising by Marchant and
Co., soft drink manufacturer, does not
suggest the company is “going broke”, as
the chairman, Mr H. F. Walsh, quickly
pointed out in Melbourne when question-
ed on the reasons for the decision, but
it definitely establishes that the company
is still crippled by sizeable liquidity
problems.
These were brought fully into the lime-
light at the annual meeting last August
when about 40 shareholders badgered
Mr Walsh for an hour on the future of
their investment.
The most significant point discussed
was the £500,000 of current assets in-
vested in stocks of screw-top bottles, the
gimmick which really put Marchants
back into the Melbourne picture and is
currently making a moderate impression
on the Sydney market.
This bottle is considerably dearer to
produce than the normal seal-top. More-
over, it is questionable whether the stocks
are “liquid” to the extent of half a mil-
lion pounds.
The Bulletin spoke to Mr C. B.
Snellgrove, the managing director, who
said considerable progress had been made
in the reduction of creditors over the past
few months. The balance of the regular
television and radio commitments had
been cancelled in line with the normal
policy of “keeping tabs on expenditure.”
He said that sponsorship of programmes
could well be resumed at a later date.
When Mr Walsh was asked whether
he did not think advertising usually in-
creased profits, he answered that the
screw-top bottle was advertising itself
and it was a matter of opinion which
form of promotion was best.
“If we had tons of money we would
use both forms but our creditors are
too large,” he said.
Some people are saying that the com-
pany is stuck with a costly gimmick. They
suggest the screw-top is rarely used be-
cause most sales are made to the family
market whose constituents usually polish
off the bottle in one go, thus eliminating
the need to re-seal.
But can Marchants afford to drop the
sales line that has won them such an
increased share of the Melbourne market
and is possibly the only angle keeping
turnover up in Sydney?
(N.B. — Tarax, a competitor of Mar-
chants, is reviewed on page 56.)
Less Gold from Orlando
Treading like some crossword puzzle
clue, the latest Press release from
Peko-Wallsend Investments Ltd reports
that in the Orlando gold mine “sustained
dilution from an unstable hanging wall
. . . has lowered average head grades.”
That is to say, a considerable volume
of production from this wall is not gold-
producing, and the gold recovery is,
therefore, reduced. Orlando profits
could, therefore, be lower than last year.
Payment of an interim 61 p.c. con-
firms last year’s dividend of 13i p.c.
which was an improvement on its pre-
decessor (Ilf p.c.). Otherwise, sales
and profits of the group for the Decem-
ber half-year are comparable with those
for the similar period in 1962.
Metal Firms to Blend
A takeover approach from G. E. Crane
Holdings Ltd was an unexpected
bonanza for shareholders of the NSW
company Watson and Crane Holdings
Ltd.
in the last three years Watson and
Crane has earned an average of 10.1

Terms of the offer are not yet known.
Pre-offer market prices were 11s. Bd. for
Watson and Crane 10s. shares and 86s.
for G. E. Crane 20s. shares. Watson
and Crane last sold at around 15s. with
buyers offering 14s. 9d., sellers asking
16s.
Watson and Crane has a foundry at
Fairfield, making plumbing brassware,
non-ferrous castings, including aluminium
hot pressings, forgings and electroplat-
ing. All types of plumbing, building and
engineering supplies are merchandised
from Waterloo.
During 1962 a new division was open-
ed to supply and erect specialised flat-
type roofing.
G. E. Crane makes rolled products in
aluminium, copper and their alloys, oper-
ates an engineering division and makes
plumbers’ brassware, sheetmetal goods,
lead products, collapsible tubes (such as
for toothpaste) and other metal contain-
ers.
Comalco Industries Pty Ltd, the CRA
subsidiary, has a one-fifth interest in
G. E. Crane, to which it supplies metals.
Whatever the terms, Watson and Crane
shareholders can be expected to fare
better within the G. E. Crane fold.
G. E. Crane shares enjoy one of the
highest ratings on the market; they are
consistently low-yielding.
Knitting Up Loose Ends ]
A stor Consolidated Mills Ltd seems
bent on knitting up loose ends, after
receiving a partial takeover offer from
an English manufacturer of knitting
wools, Emu Wool Industries Ltd.
It recently announced an offer of five
2s. shares plus 20s. cash for every eight
ss. shares in Processing Industries, a
company which Astor sponsored in 1959,
and which has never paid a dividend.
Astor makes and markets worsted
spun yarns and is the best customer of
Processing Industries which produces
tops from synthetic fibres and does
dyeing.
The two companies have identical

boards so there will be no top-level
opposition to the takeover.
Meanwhile Emu Wool’s offer of 4s.
per Astor 2s. share for half Astor’s
capital of <£116,030 still stands. Ex-
Processing shareholders will not qualify
for the Emu offer, but Emu will have
an option to take up extra Astor shares
to maintain a 50 p.c. holding
Astor sold off its thread-making sub-
sidiary, Astor Textile Pty Ltd, to the
Australian subsidiary of English Sewings
Ltd, in May last year, and was able to
return capital of 3s. a share.
So the Emu deal is the second over-
seas compliment paid to Astor’s manage-
ment.
Although the earnings potential of
the newly constituted Astor group will
be an unknown quantity until at least
the next profit release in September,
the 2s. shares have considerable appeal
to the individual investor prepared to
bide his time for a year or so.
Recent sales were posted at 3s. 7d.,
and if sellers can be attracted with offers
of less than 45., the buyer runs little
risk. If Emu, the second largest manu-
facturer of knitted wools in England,
thinks the shares are worth 45., why
should Australian investors doubt it?
Provided, of course, that Emu’s offer
is accepted, Astor will in future supply
hand knitting yarns to Emu Wools (Aus-
tralia) Pty Ltd, which at present gets
its supplies from Yorkshire. This business
will be some sort of replacement for the
sale of the thread subsidiary.
And the greater scarcity of the Astor
shares will be a factor in maintenance
of its share price. In fact, an intending
investor might do well to check on the
Processing avenue to an Astor share-
holding. [f the Processing shares can be
picked up for 4s. 6d., this seems the
easiest way in.
“If at first you don’t succeed . .
Wills Goldfields should see a
better response from investors when
it makes a second attempt to float to
public status in February-March.
The first attempt, made in July, 1962,
failed dismally. Little interest was held
for gold shares.
This time the company is going to the
public with more definite plans. The
initial float calls for only £lOO,OOO, part
of which wiil be a cash deposit on a gold
and silver field at Glen Wills (Vic.),
40 miles north of Omeo in South
Gippsland.
The present owner, Mr K. M. Wright,
purchased the field ir< 1952 from the
Maude and Yellow Girl Gold Mining
Co., whose directors apparently regarded
the field as useless. Mr Wright has proved
them wrong over the past years.
Ihe rest of the money will erect a
plant to treat the gold and silver ore.
Eventually, with the profits from these
activities plus the funds from a possible
call to shareholders, tin reefs recently
discovered at Mt Wills nearby will be
developed.
The present glamor which tin holds
on stock markets will certainly lure in
some investors. The company is at
present awaiting the full test results of
assays being made on the tin ore.
Directors believe that the ore also
contains around 50 p.c. mica—a very
valuable product which is imported in
volume by Australia.
Despite the fact that the initial pro-
gramme is largely developmental, share-
holders may still see early benefits. The
£lOO,OOO issue will consist of 10 p.c
cumulative preferred ordinary shares
with a par of ss. After three years they
will convert to normal units.
Listing is planned for Adelaide, Mel-
bourne and Sydney. Although the likeli-
hood of an underwriter is slim, there
will be brokers handling the issue and
two well-known Australian gold com-
panies are believed to be considering an
investment.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Are Dunlops Under-Valued?
A short while ago, the results of Dun-
lopillo Pty Ltd were publicised. It
would appear that this wholly-owned
subsidiary of Dunlop Rubber Australia
contributed about li p.c. of the group
profit for 1962-63. One naturally
wonders about the "‘product mix” of a
group of companies such as Dunlop,
whose operating divisions have been
classified by the company under the
headings of automotive, industrial pro-
ducts, footwear and garments, Dunlop-
illo, flooring and sports goods.
Generally, one comes to the conclusion
that, of the group sales, the automotive
division probably provides up to 70 p.c.
of the total sales, which means that
profitability is heavily dependent on the
future of the automotive industry gener-
ally.
The future growth that is likely to
occur in the motor car industry must be
largely a matter of opinion. Growth
has been rapid over the last seven years
when the average annual compound rate
of increase in the number of vehicles
on the register has been between 6 p.c.
and 7 p.c. Estimates of future growth
rates range downwards from these levels
to about 4i p.c.
Dunlop must be a large supplier of
replacement equipment since the original
equipment of tyres and batteries can
hardly be expected to last much over two
years with normal use. Basically, then,
one would expect sales to increase at the
same rate as the total number of vehicles
on register, weighted a little by the num-
ber of new registrations. However be-
cause of the extreme competition in both
the tyre and battery fields, any marked
upward lift in the prices of these pro-
ducts seems rather unlikely at the present
point of time.
|"|ver the last seven years Dunlop sales
v have been increasing at the rate of
11 p.c. per annum compound on aver-
age, but part of this increase results from
acquisitions (outside the automotive field)
and there have also been some increases
in prices. It is, therefore, not unlikely
that sales volume has increased at the
rate of between 6 p.c. and 7 p.c. per
annum, although it is quite possible that
Dunlop may have increased its share of
the automotive market.
Over the last 12 months there have
been two moves to extend manufacturing
activities, and in both cases Dunlop has
been associated with Olympic. It may
well be that this association is necessary
to give the volume production needed
and, in view of the earlier association in
Wheels & Rims Pty Ltd, Olympic was a
more logical partner than Hardie Rub-
ber Co. which also proposes to establish
a manufacturing unit in Western Aus-
tralia.
It seems rather strange that no earlier
moves had ever been made to set up
manufacturing units in either South Aus-
tralia or Western Australia, and as the
total investment by Dunlop and Olympic
seems to be of the order of £1 million
(or only just over li p.c. of the total
investment of these two companies) it
does not seem that the cost was the
deterrent.
One could be forgiven for jumping to
the conclusion that the moves have been
prompted by the possibility that over-
seas competitors could gain a strong
foothold in these two States now that
there has been some reduction in duties
on tyres. While the investment could
increase sales it is probable that it is only
a defensive move.
With a view to deciding if Dunlop
shares have been seriously under-valued
for the last three years and the current
price of 475. 6d. is a realistic one, it is
desirable to examine the correlation be-
tween sales, earnings and ordinary divi-
dends.
A T this stage it may be worth pointing
out that the price of 475. 6d. is
equivalent to about 68s. 6d. cum the
bonus and cash issues made in July, 1963.
This represents an increase of 56 p.c. in
the share price in less than 15 months.
Precise sales figures have been given for
only the last five years and during this
period the increase has been of the order
of 42 p.c. in money terms. Net profit
before tax, depreciation and interest on
fixed loans has increased by only 18 p.c.
over the same period.
This relationship between sales and net
profit before tax and depreciation suggests
that over the period of five years there
has been a reduction in margins and
whether this is likely to be a continuing
factor in all fields of Dunlop activities
it is difficult to say.
However, because of the relatively
fixed nature of prior charges such as
interest and preference dividend, earn-
ings available to ordinary shareholders
increased by over 25 p.c. during this
five-year period, and per share earnings
increased by nearly 22 p.c. despite the
increases in capital which took place
over the period.
The total ordinary dividend payout
increased by 20 p.c. and the dividend
per share by nearly 16 p.c.
This increase in dividends per share
has been running at the rate of 3 p.c. per
annum compound over the last five years,
and over the ten-year period at the rate
of about 4i p.c. compound. Neither rate
is really sufficient to justify the present
low yield of just under 3.4 p.c. from
the expected 8 p.c. dividend which was
forecast last July.
Tt seems, therefore, that those buying
the shares today are expecting some
fairly substantial further benefits to share-
holders in the very near future, even
though the one-for-four bonus issue and
one-for-three cash issue at par provided
a lift in dividend income of 12i p.c.
only six months ago.
However, earnings in the 1962-63 year
are certainly very adequate to cover the
future dividend commitment of 8 p.c.
on the increased capital, and the com-
pany has an excellent record of almost
annual increases in dividend payouts
apart from the three years ended in
June, 1961, 1962 and 1963.
While the shares, therefore, seem fully
priced at the present time, one could not
suggest from this record that they are
over-priced.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Less Lolly in Soft Drinks
Reason for tumbling share prices
/~|ne-time darling of the young investor,
” Tarax Drinks Holdings Ltd ss.
shares are struggling on the market to
hold half their top price for 1963.
At 10s. 3d. the yield is 4.8 p.c.
and on last earning rate of 13 p.c. for
the year to June 30, 1963, that gives an
unimpressive earnings yield of 6.3 p.c.
The profit shrank from £175,966 to
£117,522 after heavier depreciation
charges (up £39,585 to £170,680) bat
a negligible tax provision of £11,500
(down £98,000).
Directors’ explanation for the low tax
provision was the recoupment of prior
losses in several acquired subsidiaries
and the 20 p.c. investment allowance on
new capital expenditure.
As the gross increase in plant invest-
ment was only £80,194, losses carried
forward were apparently the more im-
portant factor.
The company was first listed in Mel-
bourne in March, 1959, since when sev-
eral businesses have been acquired: Tee
Vee Drinks Pty Ltd of Geelong, Loy
Bros Pty Ltd and Milsworth Aerated
Waters Pty Ltd, both of Melbourne,
Summons and Graham Ltd, Sharpe Bros
Pty Ltd and Consolidated Beverage Co.
Ltd, all of Sydney, and Ecks Holdings
Ltd.
The year 1961-62, when profit receded
by about £6OOO, was defined as one of
consolidation and expansion. Tarax
launched itself on the NSW market,
where it found trading conditions more
competitive than at home and distribu-
tion methods substantially different.
(Tarax, incidentally, introduced its own
distribution methods.)
Purchase of sufficient bottles and cases
to serve a much bigger market than the
home market, and introduction of Dixi
Cola, an American type cola drink with
its own special bottles, cases and cans,
was a project involving heavy initial ex-
penditure.
During 1962-63 Sharpe Bros Pty was
integrated with Summons and Graham.
Pty, and production concentrated at
Homebush. Surplus properties at Parra-
matta and Leichhardt were to be sold.
Tarax introduced soft drinks in cans
to the Australian market in 1961-62,
an event which involved major expendi-
ture at Huntingdale in Victoria and
Chullora in NSW.
Soda water, dry ginger ale and bitter
lemon are also canned for the adult
market. Tarax cans are marketed
through food stores (the UK and US pat-
tern), and these outlets handle larger
volume on a low profit margin.
A low calorie soft drink was put on
the market in 1962-63.
The Tarax bottling plants are located
at Huntingdale, Brunswick, Geelong and
Chullora.
The Ecks factory was closed in 1962-
63 and production merged with Tarax
at Brunswick and Huntingdale.
A separate division controls the manu-
facture and distribution of bottled drinks,
other than Tarax, for home delivery.
Loy Bros is at Burnley (Vic.), Tee Vee
Drinks at Mentone, and Sharpe Bros-
Summons and Graham at Homebusb
(NSW).
Granted the NSW weather conditions
were unfavorable in the second half of
1962-63, but Tarax seems to have ex-
perienced very real organisational prob-
lems in the year under review.
Substantial loan capital was obtained
in the last two years, and the 1963 ac-
counts show a big build-up in bank over-
draft, from £29,786 to £416,177.
Stocks have rocketed to almost four
times the level required in June, 1961.
Certainly the business is much more ex-
tensive and comprehensive than it was
two years ago, but shareholders would
like to know how the sales compare.
Tarax continues its policy of exclud-
ing from its assets bottles and cases in
the hands of customers, but directors
commented that under a new policy
certain bottle stocks in factories at the
end of the year were valued at cost.
Using the very substantial share pre-
mium which the company enjoyed, Tarax
has strengthened shareholders’ funds by
the acquisition of smaller competitors.
However, shareholders did not bargain
for the very severe drop in earnings, and
their surprise was registered in tumbling
share prices.
Sale of surplus properties after closing
down plants should improve liquidity in
1963-64.
Greater prestige was expected from
the fact that Tarax became a nationally
advertised product in 1963. It seems
that the key to the future is in the sales.
The company does not deserve a
higher investment rating than at present
until it shows evidence (perhaps in the
interim report in April) of greatly im-
proved sales on a good profit margin.

RAYNORS HOLDINGS LTD
Some Attention Warranted
IDaynors Holdings Ltd earned a re-

Sons Pty which held all the capital of
Raynors Pty.
The firm had been in the general en-
graving field since 1898, and in the years
approaching the Second World War,
metal engraving, including the manu-
facture of name-plates, became a speci-
alty.
In 1955 a new factory was completed
at Punchbowl, making metal pressings,
diecastings, plastic mouldings and en-
graved components for automobiles,
domestic appliances, and the electronic
and engineering industries.
Printed circuit boards were produced
for the television and electronic indus-
tries under world patents.
The industries for which Raynors
caters have their cycles, and in 1960-61
profit retreated sharply, but still covered
the usual 10 p.c. dividend.
In 1960 a Melbourne and an Adelaide
company were taken over for share con-
siderations.
The AMP Society took up £50,000 in
preference shares which are being re-
deemed at the rate of £2500 a year.
Shareholders have participated in the
company's development by taking up a
one-for-one par issue in November, 1959.
Stocks were reduced from £164,003 to
£142,909 over the last year, and the
1962-63 accounts show a reduction in
bank overdraft with a comparable in-
crease in sundry creditors and accrued
charges.
At 13s. 3d. to yeild 3.7 p.c., the ss.
shares have not had a rise comparable
with the rest of the market, and merit
some attention by virtue of the reported
“very high” level of production in the
first half of the current year.
The ordinary shares are listed in Syd-
ney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane.

GEOFF. K. GRAY (HOLDINGS) LTD
Auctioneer’s History is Good
eoff. K. Gray (Hol.dings) Ltd is a
comparative newcomer to the Stock
Exchange list, but is nevertheless well
known as an auctioneer and valuer in
Sydney.
One of its less known activities the
one which appeared to have caused the
decline in profit last year is furniture
retailing at Manly and Eastwood, an
activity which has had to cope with
extremely keen competition in recent
years. Nevertheless, Gray's profit-earn-
ing history is good.
From £12,533 in 1959-60, the first
year of listing, the company lifted earn-
ings to £26.688 and then to £38,186
(equal to 36 p.c. on capital) in 1961-62.
However, the installation of additional
facilities, plus unrealistic trade-ins for
furniture, brought profit back in the
1962-63 year to £23,231, equal to 21.7
p.c. on capital of £107,000.

JAMES WALLACE (HOLDINGS) LTD
Widely Diversified Interests
Tn a year generally regarded as very
A difficult for the building industry,
James Wallace (Holdings) Ltd was able
to produce a result regarded by directors
as “highly gratifying”.
The net profit actually slipped by
£20,449 (or 12.6 p.c.) 'to £140,990,
giving an earning rate of 214 p.c., com-
pared with 28.0 p.c. on average capital
employed in the year to June 30, 1962.
The latest profit was after providing
£99,092 for tax, and charging £53,197
for depreciation and amortisation.
No takeovers were effected during
1962-63, and although technically
Smiggins ( Kosciusko) Ltd was a sub-
sidiary at balance date, and subsequently
floated off as an independent public
company, the figures included in the
attached accounts summary for 1963
exclude that company.
Directors said the emphasis in 1962-
63 was on consolidation. In the pre-
ceding year, Mutual Development
Corporation Ltd and C. I. Walker
and Sons Pty Ltd were acquired by a
share exchange, and in 1960-61 H. T.
Worrall and Sons Pty and Premier Win-
dows Pty were added to the group.
The organisation had its birth as a
tug-owner 90 years ago. It wasn’t until
1944 that building and construction was
undertaken, and in 1947 the company
built the first post-war multi-storey
building in the city of Sydney. This was
the Grand United Order of Oddfellows’
building in Castlereagh Street.
It then moved into joinery, structural
steel and equipment hiring, and in
October, 1957, a holding company was
formed and converted to a public com-
pany to take over all these activities,
plus property development.
Today operations embrace building
and contracting, development and pro-
ject construction, structural steel and
joinery, wholesale and retail hardware,
plant hiring, freehold and leasehold
property, home building and renovations,
the manufacture of aluminium curtain
walls and windows, a travel agency, loan
and hire purchase finance, printing and
linotyping.
Every type and phase of construction
is undertaken by the company, but the
job for which the company will achieve
most renown will undoubtedly be the
redevelopment of The Rocks area on
the south-east of the Sydney Harbour
bridge southern approach.
This is a £3O million scheme which
will give James Wallace’s building
division a continuous basic turnover for
the next ten years.
James Wallace was awarded the con-
tract which was tendered for last March
by four other groups.
The venture will not be financed
through James Wallace. Shareholders
were relieved to get this assurance from
the chairman (Mr N. W. Clark) in his
1963 annual address. When final
negotiations have been completed, share-
holders will be advised of the method
of finance.
It is assumed that a separate company
will be formed to handle the project and
seek outside funds. Institutions that
want to own property in the area may
finance these buildings themselves. A
leading Melbourne sharebroker has
agreed to negotiate finance in Australia,
and if necessary, from overseas.
At any rate, the risks of such an
enormous project will not be borne
directly by James Wallace shareholders.
Directors consider their £100,002 in-
vestment in Smiggins (Kosciusko) Ltd
which was formed to develop the Smig-
gins Holes area of the Kosciusko State
Park, should be well worth while.
During 1962-63 extra finance was
obtained for the group by a £500,000
debenture issue.
Shareholders have not been called on
to subscribe extra capital since flotation,
although a placement of 150,000 ss.
shares in 1961 was made partly to
shareholders.
The company made a three-for-two
bonus before going public in 1959.
A dispute over the balance of a con-
tract was the subject of long arbitration
proceedings, and a compromise sum was
finally settled for during 1963 which
exceeded the amount brought into
account during 1962. The considerable
legal expenses were absorbed in 1963
results.
There are other proceedings in train
to recover certain debts of subsidiary
companies.
Debtors rose from £778,110 to
£1,095,048 in 1962-63. The value of
work in progress and stock on hand, at
cost of construction to date, including
goods and services supplied by sub-
sidiaries at normal trade rates, less pro-
gress claims actually received, rose over
the year from £1,210,042 to £j,444,789.
Contracts on hand at balance date or
to be commenced during 1963-64 total
£ll million. The first overseas building
venture was undertaken with the
securing of a £2 million contract for the
Auckland City Council.
At 1 Is. 6d. the ss. shares yield a reason-
able 5.2 p.c. Apparently investors are
holding back until announcement is
made of financial arrangements for The
Rocks project.
The company has been careful to keep
its capital relatively tight and it should
show in future the same caution under
continuous management.
A modest investment at present prices
should not lead the buyer far astray.

Why was Geo. Pizzey
Overlooked?
nnHERE is a long list of shares that have
A failed to rise in line with the rest
of the market over the past month. For
most of them there exists a sound reason
for apathy, such as a patchy past or a
doubtful future. Others have been subject
to abnormal selling pressure as investors
move their funds to what they consider
will be a more profitable holding.
But there are a few shares which have
apparently been overlooked. One of
them is Geo. Pizzey & Son Ltd, Mel-
bourne-based leather merchant, tanner,
importer, exporter and shoe mercer who
also has minor interests in the engineer-
ing, plastics and indenting fields.
Pizzey’s prospects for 1963-64 are
particularly bright and yet the shares
hung around their December closing
price of 12s. 3d. until last week when
a short buying burst took them over 13s.
It is hard to pinpoint any definite
reason for the lack of interest which is
now prevailing again, but the fact that
the tanning trade was r,ot recommended
by brokers as one of the 1964 “glamor”
industries could have something to do
with it. Geo. Pizzey, however, is an
extremely well-based and ably managed
firm with more than 43 years of ex-
perience as a public company behind it.
After record export earnings in the
1962-63 year, profit peaked from
£102,499 to £142,208 and the
dividend, covered by a 20.9 p.c. earning
rate, was boosted frorp 10 to 12 p.c.
Trading in the current year has been
buoyant.
Apart from this there are three other
factors which make the shares a good
buy at current levels. First is the reason-
able dividend yield of about 4.6 p.c.,
reinforced by an earnings yield of
8.4 p.c.
Second is the asset backing of 19s. 6d.
behind each ss. share.
Third, no issue has been made to
shareholders since 1951 when a one-
for-one bonus followed an assets re-
valuation in 1949-50. At June 30 last,
paid capital was only £754,523 of total
shareholders’ funds which came out at
£2,433,399, so there is plenty of
opportunity for directors to make
another bonus issue when they feel the
time is right.
All in all, things look very promising
and the investor could score considerable
gains through a parcel of shares
purchased quickly.
Speculator’s Diary
Otockmarkets have their moments of
excitement but you have to go into
the fruit markets to get the real thing.
The biggest news the stockmarket
could muster up last week has been
RMC, or should I say the directors of
RMC, entering the field of underwriting
and development. A most spectacular
but depressing feature of the proposed
development company is the huge
capital of £2.4 million. It dwarfs the
capital of £1.6 million of Melbourne-
based Australian United Corporation
and the capital of £l.O million of Sydney-
based Development Finance Corpora-
tion. These two companies are the
largest in this very testing industry. Their
success lies in the experience and ability
of management.
Four of the seven directors in the
proposed new company will come from
the RMC board. None of the present
RMC directors has any substantial ex-
perience in development financing, so
we must look to the three outside direc-
tors (as yet unnamed) to guide the com-
pany initially.
The RMC directors, in speaking of
the prospects of the new company, said:
“Dividends from the company in the
early years cannot be expected to be
more than moderate, but the shares
should hold excellent prospects of
growth in the longer term view.” My
question is “Why?'’
I am sure that the shareholder who is
interested in the welfare of RMC, and
consequently of its shareholders, would
have much preferred to have the great
bulk of the £7.4 million (the cash pro-
ceeds of the UK sale) returned to him.
A generous bonus issue by the company
would then have brought the reduced
capital up to a level in tune with current
operations. Instead RMC is to be saddled
with a development company from
which little can be expected for some
years at least.
It looks like an eventful meeting on
February 10, reminiscent of one some
18 months ago. I am hoping to receive
a free invitation.
All this idle chatter is not getting me
any nearer the market.
This week I started in the “As”.
Before Christmas, my man Philip across
the Tasman reminded me of the ap-
proaching conversion of Automobile and
General Finance notes. They have now
just one month to go before they convert
into shares.
If ever a company was in a position
to have a bonus issue, this is it. Over
the years, earning rate has steadily
moved up and was a fantastic 90 p.c. to
capital last year. Even after the notes
convert, earning rate on the increased
capital would be a high 48 p c.
Let’s be conservative and assume
profits do not increase this year. Then
if the company had a l-for-2 bonus
issue, it would still more than twice cover
the normal 15 p.c. dividend.
It seemed such a good short-term
prospect that in went my order for 500
notes.
On to almost the other end of the
scale with a purchase of 500 Watson
and Crane. With the announcement of
a takeover by G. E. Crane, the shares
promptly moved up 4s. The operator
for my broker struggled with opposing
operators and after some days I emerged
as the owner of 500 shares at an average
price of 14s. 9d. Admittedly G. E.
Crane is more in the long-term category,
but good long-term investments often
become good short-term buys. I am
also gambling on a l-for-5 share offer.
The tone of my selling this week was
defensive. Both my ODE and Tableland
Tin holdings were halved. Respective
profits were £2B and £77 respectively.
Hestia was a case of getting out where
I had come in. Brokerage played its
part and the loss was £ll.
Transactions for this week were:
SOLD
500 Hestia, 9/6 £232
1000 ODE, 6/6 £314
400 Tableland Tin, 26/9 £526
BOUGHT
500 Automobile & Gen. Finance
notes, 26/- £662
500 Watson & Crane, 14/9 £376
Balancing my account seems to be-
coming almost commonplace each week.
This time it's a credit of £l5 standing
in the account.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Who Owns the Country?
City man’s idea is a myth
By JOHN ANDREW
Dome months ago The Bulletin’s
“Speculator’s Diary” referred to a
book called “The 60 Families Who Own
Australia” . . . good, strong stuff which
every dabbler in shares should have for
reference. The author devoted himself
in the main to an examination of in-
dustrial, manufacturing and financial
houses.
If it is true that 60 families do control
these complexities—and it might be so
• —how many then own the land?
The bulk of Australia’s more import-
ant rural activities are in the hands of
fewer people than one would imagine
possible in'l964.
It is an easy matter to discover how
many rural holdings there are in Aus-
tralia and how many people live on
them. The Commonwealth Year Book
tells us there are about 250,000 holdings
supporting, in part or whole, about one
million men, women and children.
In a population of 10 million, and an
area.of some three million square miles,
this is perhaps small enough. But it
means little really, as “holdings” are any-
thing from one acre upwards and opinion
varies greatly on how much of our 3
million square miles is useful agricultural
land. The “boosters” go as high as three-
parts of it. More cautious experts put
it at less than half.
r\uR biggest rural industry, by a good
margin, is wool. The Wool Industry
Statistical Handbook reveals that there
are about 110,000 flock owners in Aus-
tralia. They own altogether something
in excess of 150 million sheep.
Of these 110,000 flock owners only
15,000 have flocks of more than 2000
sheep each. Now 2000 sheep does not
make one a squatter. Perhaps 5000
might just enable one to qualify, but
2000 is a good round figure and, besides,
it is an available statistic.
These 15,000 flock owners, each
having more than 2000 sheep, own in all
about 85 million sheep. And some 96,000
flock owners, each with less than 2000
sheep, have about 65 million sheep in
all.
Assuming that 30 sheep provide a
bale of wool, it follows that the 15,000
bigger flocks produce 2.8 million bales
of wool while the 96,000 smaller flocks
produce 2.2 million bales.
At this point another factor must be
appreciated—generally speaking it is the
wool from the bigger flocks which brings
the highest prices. The big station is in
a position to breed better sheep, to buy
better replacements, to class the wool
more effectively, and to cull inferior
animals more readily.
fFHE point is that 15,000 owners of big
-*■ flocks—about one-seventh of all
woolgrowers—produce more wool, and
more top quality wool, than the remain-
ing 96,000 small owners who, on paper,
represent six-sevenths of the industry.
When you begin to convert bales to
money there is a problem. A bale of
wool can be worth anything from £5O
to £5OO depending on quality and the
fluctuations of the market.
The average price per bale of wool
sold in the six months ended in December
was £9O. But again one might assume
that many of the big properties would
have averaged a good deal higher than
that, while many of the small properties
might have been lucky to get the average
price.
This is one of the main arguments of
those who want a change in the auction
system of selling wool. The big property,
they allege, gets favored treatment (good
selling times, etc.), and is in a position to
withdraw its wool if it wishes and sell
later. The small man takes what he can
get.
Many of the 96,000 smaller wool-
growers could be selling less than 70
bates of wool worth less than £4OOO a
year. By the time costs, tax, property
maintenance and so on are accounted
for, there often is not much left.
With some of the bigger properties
the returns from the wool clip can be
astronomic.
To give an idea of how big the really
big properties can be it was revealed in
1957 that Kooba, which had been the
biggest of several properties owned by
Sydney millionaire F. W. Hughes, was
carrying something like 105,000 sheep.
(On today’s prices their wool would have
been worth £350,000 plus.) At the same
time in Queensland there were 129,000
on Thylungra, owned by Australian
Estates Co. Ltd.
Others running between 40,000 and
60,000 were Haddon Rig, Boonoke,
Yanga and Buckinguy in NSW, and
Noondoo, Ardmore, Fernlee, Lans-
downe, Rockwood, Portland Downs and
Boorara in Queensland.
Naturally these figures can vary
greatly from year to year depending on
management as well as seasonal factors.
They are included simply to give un-
familiar readers an idea of what a really
big sheep station is.
Statistics can confuse and one must
stress that many of those 96,000
smaller sheep owners will also engage in
wheat, fat lamb or beef operations. So
will many of the bigger ones.
Some allowance certainly should be
made for this sort of thing but even so
it is somewhat revealing to discover that
about 15,000 properties provide the
biggest and most important part of Aus-
tralia’s wool clip.
What of other rural industries?
We know, from the Commonwealth
Year Book, that there a-re about 250,000
holdings in rural Australia. This number
includes sheep and cattle properties as
well as those producing wheat, oats,
dairy produce, fruit, poultry, pigs and
so on, and also those properties which
combine two or more of these activities.
What we want here are the ones that
really count those of such size and
stature that their owners are in a position
to control the rate of production, and
the growth of production, of each of
the commodities they produce.
The bigger pastoral companies all
have lists of the properties they consider
important in each rural district.
Once again one is struck by the
relatively small number of properties
considered worthy of inclusion: — In
the whole of NSW, 18,000; Victoria,
15,000; Queensland, 7000; SA, 4500;
Tasmania, 600; and Northern and
Central Australia, 300. West Australia
is not included only because this list was
compiled for a company which does not
operate in WA. But if we allow 3000,
say, for the West, this gives us a grand
total of fewer than 50,000 big
growers of wool, wheat, beef, milk,
cheese, mutton, lamb, pork, eggs,


chickens, fruit, vegetables, oats and pea-
nuts and so on in the whole of Australia.
This figure would probably be over-
generous. Many “borderline” properties
would be included on the list. One man
puts the real figure at around 30,000;
that is about 15,000 big sheep properties
and about the same number for all
other rural industries combined.
But even 50,000 properties is really
not much in terms of people, and a pro-
portion would be owned by companies.
It would certainly be less than the popu-
lation of many a Sydney or Melbourne
suburb.
The 200,000 - odd “unimportant”
properties which are left may not be
lived on by people who are exactly
starving; but they may not be very well
off either.
The reasons are complex and varied,
of course, and cannot be evaluated
entirely in terms of profit and loss as
in the case of most businesses.
In the light of these figures the
popular notion of the city man that the
average farmer is “in the chips” is ex-
posed surely as a myth. Many are
attached to the land whether it pays well
or not.
And if someone were to say that the
general situation, from the angle of
national development, is not as healthy
as it should be, one would have to agree.
Case Against Pesticides
Era of integrated control at hand
By MARIEL LEE
“Tf,” wrote one reviewer of Rachel
Carson’s “The Silent Spring”, that
startling indictment of pesticides, “man
fails to keep his powerful weapons under
intelligent control, and works against,
rather than with, natural law he will
inevitably bring about great danger to
himself and his resources.”
Man, ever since he first lived off the
land, has, by magic and science, com-
bated weeds, insects and diseases
affecting stock and crops; but only within
the last quarter-century have three
organic compounds promised complete
victory: the insecticide DDT, the herbi-
cide 24D, and the “wonder drug”
penicillin.
Research has produced other com-
pounds, which, man now learns, can be
as powerful against him.
Agricultural, forestry and health
workers particularly risk poisoning by
skin absorption, but pesticides have con-
siderable secondary or transmitted
effects. Already some countries have
legislated to enforce the precautions
advised bv scientists and manufacturers.
Great Britain has, since January 1,
1962, prohibited field, farm and forest
sprays containing heptachlor, dieldrin
and aldrin, and, like the United States
and New Zealand, banned lindane,
which, mixed with fertiliser or sprayed
to control pasture grubs, is still used in
Victoria, although it endangers birds and
fish, and illegally high residues have
been found in the milk and meat of
animals grazed on sprayed pastures.
Some would even insist on all
chemical compounds being tested for
possible side-effects and proved safe be-
fore, precisely labelled, they are offered
for sale.
Only 500 of the more than 50,000
insect varieties in Australia are classified
as pests. Many species dwindle and
disappear as forests are cleared and
pastures improved, but some few in-
crease enormously.
“Many things we consider pests,” says
the reviewer already quoted, “are only
so because they thrive in the artificial
environment mass agriculture provides ”
And how they thrive! There is in-
creasing world demand for pesticides,
the manufacture and sale of which in the
United States alone had by 1961 risen
to 612 million pounds weight, worth 300
million dollars, or £AI4B million; big
business, indeed.
Most of these pesticides were for agri-
cultural use, but in 1962 one-and-a-half
million acres of United States forests
were sprayed.
"Oresent pesticides do not discriminate
A between actual pests, insects which
check potential pests, and insects actively
helpful to man. Most regretted victims
are bees, on whose fertilising services
much crop success depends.
A Horsham (Vic.) market gardener,
one of thousands suffering such loss,
reports greatly reduced tomato and other
crops since aerial farm spraying killed
the bees once plentiful along nearby
river frontages. His crops, too, are more
damaged by insects which, since soraying
killed their natural competitors and
predators, now breed unchecked. Im-
proved pastures, rid of red-legged earth
mites by DDT, now suffer from lucerne
fleas.
Yet pesticides must still be used in-
creasingly for economic food production
now. and to prevent food shortages as
world population, increasing by 5000
every hour, doubles itself in the next 30
years.
American experts estimate that, but
for heavy use of pesticides, their output
of apples, potatoes, citrus fruits and
cotton would drop by half, and of milk,
meat and wool by one-quarter. Use
of parathion and malathion increased
Japanese rice production by 30 p.c.
DDT, aided by BHC, dieldrin and mala-
thion, has wiped out many anopheles
breeding grounds, but more remain. In
the past decade 250 millions contracted
malaria, which still kills two-and-a-half
millions annually.
Augmented food supplies are dearly
bought. Between 1953 and 1958 in-
creased rice crops cost Japan three
thousand dead and thousands more ill
of parathion. The incalculable world
cost will inevitably rise with pesticide
use.
T>esticides, easily stockpiled for emer-
A gencies, most effectively counter un-
expected outbreaks; their expensive re-
current use, however, only controls,
never eradicates pests, some of which
develop resistance, as sheep blowflies
have done to aldrin and dieldrin, and
may eventually do to diazinon, now
effective, and as rabbits are doing to
myxomatosis.
Biological control, improved cultiva-
tion and selection of resistant varieties
will more surely, and safely, eradicate
pests than the most powerful pesticides
research can find.
Queensland's prickly pear, in 1925
spreading five acres per minute in spite
of extensive poisoning, was conquered
within five years by cactoblastis. Nova
Scotian orchardists, barely controlling
codlin moth by pesticides, found that
natural enemies and occasional selective
sprays dealt more surely with codlin
and other insect pests. Predator insects
are now used against sirex wood wasps.
Even better results come from releas-
ing male insects sterilised by gamma rays
from a radio-active cobalt source, for
their matings produce no progeny, so
the species rapidly declines. By this
means Florida eliminated screw-worms.
Further research on the requisite
balance of essential soil nutrients, like
that on trace elements, would ensure
vigorous, healthy crops little affected by
pests. Resistant plant and animal
varieties also lessen pests; culling sheep
for breech wrinkles has reduced blowfly
strike. Here selective compounds, fatal,
like myxomatosis for rabbits, to par-
ticular species, are valuable supplements.
Meanwhile, there are practical as well
as humanitarian reasons for ending the
needless slaughter of wildlife which
Rachel Carson, perhaps over sensation-
ally, attacked in “The Silent Spring”.
Residues of poison, a threat to man,
are building up in the tissues of wildlife.
Every freshwater fish in the United States
is said to contain DDT residues, which
are also found in the tissues and eggs of
Canadian ducks 500 miles from where
DDT has been used. The DDT, mala-

thion, sevin and guthion in field sprays
must similarly affect Australian wildlife.
More rigorous policing of pesticide
manufacture and use, with legal action
against the ignorant or careless who
endanger life, would protect willing allies
fighting pests.
Research, perhaps financed jointly by
governments and primary industry, can,
and must, provide biological and chemi-
cal insurance against songless spring.
For, as Dr Waterhouse, Chief of the
CSIRO Division of Entomology, says,
“the era of pesticides is past, and the
era of integrated control (the combina-
tion of natural or biological control with
limited use of insecticides) is rapidly
being ushered in”.
“Space Flyers” for
Sydney Show
rpwo self-propelled human “space flyers”
from USA will be a unique
attraction of this year’s Sydney Royal
Show at Easter.
The space flyers take off from a small
platform in a roar of rocket-thrust and
hurtle into space.
They can fly a distance of more than
800 feet at a speed of 60 miles an hour
to a height of nearly 60 feet. Their
means of propulsion is a “rocket belt”
perfected by the Bell Aerosystems
Company of Buffalo (NY).
The Bell Rocket Belt was developed
with the sponsorship of the US Army
as a new dimension in mobility for the
foot soldier.
The first public demonstration was
given in 1961 and later a special flight
was made for the late President Kennedy.
The space flyer blasted off from an
Army amphibious craft, flew over 200
feet of water and landed gently and
precisely in front of the President. Since
then more than five million spectators
have been thrilled by Bell Rocket Belt
flights in the United States, Canada,
Mexico, South America and France.
The three-man Rocket Belt team will
appear in Australia only at the Royal
Show. -
Ridding Poultry Farms
of Wild Birds
rpwo Victorian Government departments
Land and Agriculture have
begun experiments hoping to eliminate
sparrows and starlings on poultry farms.
These wild birds have increased alarm-
ingly during the past two years, due in
part, perhaps, to the recent extensive use
of laying cages with open feed troughs.
Investigations have shown that a surpris-
ing quantity of feed is being eaten by
sparrows and starlings, as well as other
wild birds, in the cage sheds.
This represents a serious economic
loss to the poultry industry as well as a
disease control problem.
High Jersey Prices
A draft of 36 Jersey cattle from the
well-known Bollhayes stud brought
a high average of £AI39, at Catherington,
Hampshire.
The highest price paid was £525 for
the yearling bull Bollhayes Apollo’s Myth
with 1,000-gallon, five p.c. fat females
on both sides of his pedigree.
