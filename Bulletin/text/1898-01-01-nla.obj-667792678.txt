THAT SORDID MAJORITY!
Why sordid? All majorities are influenced by motives more or less sordid.
And are Labor members above these little weaknesses ? Smokers decidedly
are not. It is because they get the best value, and because they can appre-
ciate a pure, perfect, and fragrant smoke that such a large majority always
carry

THE RED PAGE.
REVIEW Austin Dobson?’ writes Someone.
But I cannot; I like him too well. I have
a robuster mood for Praed ; and a tenderer
mood for Locker; and a jollier mood for
Calverley; and a more classical mood for Lang (I
want Lang ‘ collected’ too); but on sailor’s-pleasure
days and in my faded-rose) eaf mood I always
turn to Austin (we call him just ‘Austin,’
en famille; the Dobson assooiations breathe anti-
climax—and, priggish or not, one can’t utterly
contemn associations). And I have lost all sense
of ‘ quality ’ in companionship ; our minds have
grown alike as wife and husband grow alike in
feature and expression. But I fancy at the begin-
ning of our acquaintance I held Austin a pleasant
rhymer—sometimes a very pleasant rhymer—
but rarely more than a very pleasant rhymer.
Now we are friends he is just Austin, and
the rest goes hang. That smart fellow Juve-
nis tells me he has more craftsmanship than
inspiration; that he can navigate the shal-
lows, of sentiment, but founders in the deeps of
passion; and so on—with much antithetical
elaboration of metaphor. I agree—‘ Very likely ’
—and Juvenis, with his long pin and his label, is
off to classify the next poet for the critical
museum. I wonder what ‘A Gentleman of the
Old School ’ would think of Juvenis—he who
. . . lived in that past Georgian day,
When men were less inclined to say
That 'Time is Gold,’ and overlay
With toil their pleasure ;
He held some land, and dwelt thereon,—
Where, I forget—the house is gone ;
His Christian name, I think, was John,—
His surname, Leisure.
Reynolds has painted him—a face
Filled with a fine, old-fashioned grace,
Fresh-colored, frank, with ne’er a trace
Of trouble shaded ;
The eyes are blue, the hair is drest
In plainest way,—one hand is prest
Deep in a flapped canary rest,
With buds brocaded.
How well Austin pictures the old fellow I
He liked the well-wheel’s creaking tongue,—
He liked the thrush that stopped and sung,—
He liked the drone of flies among
His netted peaches;
He iiked to watch the sunlight fall
Athwart his ivied orchard wall;
Or pause to catch the cuckoo’s call
Beyond the beeches.
The mellowness of that verse, of the whole poem,
takes me: it seems to have grown ripe on the
same sunny wall as its subject and his peaohes.
‘Madame Placid’isa second part, and has not
quite the same appeal.
• » • *
Over ‘ Proverbs in Porcelain ’ I do not linger
so long (instead of ‘ reviewing ’ I’m telling you
what I like best); but I always linger over
‘ Babette ’ — she, I think, touches the climax of
Austin’s talent for tenderness - when he tries to
soar higher he ioses balance in the rare air of
pathos, and falls flapping clumsily (O, I see his
faults, but I feel only his oharins).
“ GOOD NIGHT, BABETTE t”
*' Si vieillesse pouvait ! ”
Scene.—A small neat Room. In a high Voltaire chair
sits a white-haired old Gentleman.
Monsieur Vieuxbois. Babette.
M. Vieuxbois (turning querulously )s
Day of my life ! Where can she get ">
Babette! I sayl Babette I— Babette 1
Bibette (entering hurriedly ):
Coming, M’sieu’! If M’sieu’ speaks
So loud, he won’t be well for weeks 1
M. Vieuxbois.
Where have you been ?
Babette.
Why, M’sieu’ knows:—
April 1 . . . Ville d’Avray I . . . Ma’am’selle Rose I
M. Vieuxbois.
Ah 1 lam old,—and I forget.
Was the place growing green, Babette?
Babette.
But of a greenness ! —yes, M’sieu' 1
And then the sky so blue!—so blue I
And when I dropped my immortelle,
How the birds sang!
(Lifting her apron to her eyes.)
This poor Ma’am’selle I
M. Vieuxbois.
You’re a good girl, Babette, but she, —
She was an Angel, verily.
Sometimes I think I see her yet
Stand smiling by the cabinet ;
And once, I know, she peeped and laughed
Betwixt the curtains . . .
Where’s the draught?
(She gives him a cup.)
Now I shall sleep, I think, Babette ;
Sing me your Norman chansonnette.
Babkt e (sings).
* Once at the Angelus
(Ere I was dead),
Angels all glorio us
Came to my Bed;
Angels in Blue and White
Crowned on the Head.’
M. Vieuxbois (drowsily).
•She was an Angel' . . . ‘Onoe she laughed*. •«
What, was I dreaming ?
Where’s the draught?
Babette (showing the empty cup) i
The draught, M’sieu’ ?
M. Vieuxbois.
How I forget!
lam so old 1 But sing, Baeette 1
Babette (sings).
‘ One was the Friend I left
Stark in the Snow ;
One was the Wife that died
Long,—long ago;
One was the Love I lost . . .
How could she know ? ’
M. Vieuxbois (murmuring).
Ah, Pan! ... old Paul I . . . Eulalib tool
And Rosa . . . And O! ‘ the sky so blue 1 *
Babette (sings).
' One had my Mother’s eyes,
Wistful and mild ;
One had my Father's face;
One was a Child :
All of them bent to me,—
Bent down and smiled /•
(He is asleep 1)
M. Vieuxbois (almost inaudibly).
' How I forget! ’
*lam so old!’ . . . 'Good-night, Babette l*
* * • •
** Vignettes ” I never liked much—l fancy them
(with exceptions) immature and flat. Perhaps
Austin is always better at vehicle than burden ;
the burden is sometimes very light in “Vignettes.*
But lam fond of “ A Gage d’Amour with the
stiff but pregnant verse—
We shut our heart up, nowadays.
Like some old music-box that plays
Unfashionable airs that raise r
Derisive pity;
Alas,—a nothing starts the spring;
And 10, the sentimental thing
At once commences quavering
Its lover’s ditty.
And then the girl—and then the sum-up—
Well, well, the wisest bend to Fate.
My brown old books around me wait.
My pipe still holds, unconfiscate,
Its wonted station.
Pass me the wine 1 To Those that keep
The bachelor’s secluded sleep
Peaceful, inviolate, and deep,
I pour libation 1
* • ♦ •
The ‘ldyll of the Carp’ is nicely handled,
surely ? And ‘ The Sundial ’ I always read twice.
The wife’s favorite, she thinks, is ‘ Before Sedan,’
with the familiar —
Ah, if beside the dead
Slumbered the pain !
Ah, if the hearts that bled
Slept with the slain 1
If the grief died But no
Death will not have it so.
I admit a virtue, yet find the art overdone—
imagine I hear Austin blowing for his own organ.
What do you think ?
• • • •
‘ The Paradox of Time ’ I cling to (are you
aware I was 52 last birthday?); and ‘AriVio-
ferix ’
(All passes. Art alone
Enduring stay* to us;
The Bust outlasts the throne,—
The Coin, Tiberius.)
for the valour of the thought (what a complicating
nuisance is the slang ‘ bust ’!) And next, in the
new ‘collection,’ comes Austin’s magnificent
maturity ‘At the Sign of the Lyre ’ —with, in
the gay forefront, the sprightliest octaves ever
penned—
THE LADIES OF ST. JAMES'S.
A PROPER NEW BALLAD OF THE COUNTRY AND THE TOW».
* Phyllida amo ante alias.’ —Viro.
The ladies of St. James’s
Go swinging to the play ;
Their footmen run before them,
With a ‘ Stand by ! Clear the way i*
But Phyllida, my Phyllida !
She takes her buckled shoon,
When we go out a-courting
Beneath the harvest moon.
The ladies of St. James’s
Wear satin on their backs;
They sit all night at Ombre,
With candles all of wax ;
But Phyllida, my Phyllida !
She dons her russet gown,
And runs to gather May dew
Before the world is down.
The ladies of St. James’s !
They are so fine and fair,
You’d think a box of essences
Was broken in the air :
But Phyllida, my Phyllida !
The breath of heath and furze,
When breezes blow at morning,
Is not so fresh as hers.
The ladies of St. James’s
They’re painted to the eyes;
Their white it stays for ever.
Their red it never dies:
But Phyllida, my Phyllida!
Her colour comes and goes;
It trembles to a lily,—
It wavers to a rose.
The ladies of St. James’s!
You scarce oau understand
The half of all their speeches,
Their phrases are so grand:
But Phyllida, my Phyllida !
Her shy and simple words
Are clear as after rain-drops
The music of the birds.
The ladies of St. James's !
They have their fits and freaks;
They smile on you- for seconds ;
They frown on you—for weeks :
But Phyllida, my Phyllida 1
Come either storm or shine,
From Shrove-tide unto Shrove-tide,
Is always true—and mine.
My Phyllida ! my Phyllida 1
I care not though they heap
The hearts of all St. James’s,
And give me all to keep ;
I care not whose the beauties
Of all the world may be,
For Phyllida—for Phyllida
Is all the world to me !
* » * *
JHere Austin finds his own ; and he follows it
with ‘The Old Sedan Chair,’ and——l must quote
THE CURE’S PROGRESS.
Monsieur the Cur 6 down the street
Comes with his kind old face, —
With his coat worn bare, and his straggling hair,
And his green umbrella-case.
You may see him pass by the little ‘ Grande Place, 9
And the tiny • Hdtel-de-Ville’ ;
He smiles, as he goes, to the fieuriste Rose,
And the pompier Theophile.
He turns, as a rule, through the ‘ Mar chi' 0001,
Where the noisy fish-wives call;
And his compliment pays to the ‘Belle ThArbse
As she knits in her dusky stall.
There’s a letter to drop at the locksmith’s shop,
And Toto, the looksmith’s niece,
Has jubilant hopes, for the Cur 6 gropes
Iu his tails for a pain d’epice.
There's a little dispute with a merchant of fruit,
Who is said to be heterodox,
That will ended be with a ‘ Ma foi, ouiF
And a pinch from the Curd’s box.
There is also a word that no one heard
To the furrier’s daughter Lou. ;
And a pale cheek fed with a flickering red,
And a “ Bon Dieu garde M'sieu’ l "
But a grander way for the Sous Prtfet,
And a bow for Ma’am’selle Anne ;
And a mock “ off-hat ” to the Notary’s oat,
And a nod to the Sacristan :
For ever through life the Curd goes
With a smile on his kind old face—
With his coat worn hare, and his struggling hair.
And his green umbrella-case.’
* • * •
Delicious picture ! And some I pass to absorb
the personal suggestion of ‘ A Revolutionary
Relic,’ and that charming child-rhyme of ‘Little
Blue-Ribbons ’; and many I cannot mention.
But you, Sir, will appreciate that reinforcement of
Red Page doctrine, ‘The Lost Elixir’—on Lowell’s
text that * One drop of ruddy human blood puts
more life into the veins of a poem than all the
delusive aurum potabile that can be distilled out of
the choicest library.’ ‘The Fables’ I read with
interest, but hardly with gURto : the ‘ Tales ’ are
better —very clever that ‘ Story from a Dic-
tionary ’ ! And on over the pages—the course that
crowns the feast! —are the ‘ Essays in Old French
Forms’ —ah! Is not ‘Circe’ best of English
triolets—in the lighter mood, at all events? And
which of Austin’s is the best English rondeau ?
one of them must be. And is there a better
English ballade than ‘The Pompadour’s Fan’—
for the art ? —though I prefer ‘ The Barmecide ’
for the idea. And what flavour in Austin’s vil-
lanelles — e.g., ‘ When I saw you last, Rose ! ’ I
hesitate among sweets, and ... give you the
in-English-inimitable chanson- fragrance of
AFTER WATTEAU.
• Embarquons-nous ! ’ I seem to go
Against my will. ’Neath alleys low
I bend, and hear across the air—
Across the stream —faint music rare, —
Whose ‘ cornemuse,' whose ‘ chalumeau’l
Hark ! was not that a laugh I know ?
Who was it, hurrying, turned to show
The galley swinging by the stair?—
‘ Embarquons-nous I ’
The silk sail flaps, light breezes blow ;
Frail laces flutter, satins flow ;
You, with the love-knot in your hair,
‘ Allans, embarqnous pour Cythere';
You will not? Press her, then, Pierrot!
‘ Embarquons-nous! ’
tTou will make room for ‘ The Wanderer’?
THE WANDERER.
Love comes baok to his vacant dwelling,—
The old, old Love that we knew of yore t
We see him stand by the open door
With his great eyes sad, and his bosom swelling.
He makes as though in our arms repelling
He fain would lie as he lay before:
Love comes back to his vacant dwelling,—
The old, old Love that we knew of yore.
Ah, who shall help us frun over-spelling
That sweet forgotten, forbidden lore 1
E’en as we doubt in our heart once more,
With a rush of tears to our eyelids willing,
Love comes back to his vacant dwelling.
That has always haunted me, and the ‘ over-
Bpelling ’ does not matter when you’re used to it.
‘Leal Souvenir’ has a touch of stiffness, but
* Ah ! but the back-look ’ glorifies it.
Leal souvenir.
“ For old sake’s sake 1 ” ’Twere hard to choose
Words fitter for an old-world Mu a
Than these, that in their cadence bring
Faint fragrance of the posy-ring,
And charms i hat rustic lovers use.
The long day lengthens, and we lose
The first pale flush, the morning hues—
Ah! but the back-look, lingering,
For old sake’s sake !
That we retain. Though Time refuse
To lift the veil on forward views,
Despot in most, he is not king
Of those kind memories that cling
Around his travelled avenues
For old sake’s sake !
* * * •
And, for a last word, take Austin’s own—
In after days when grasses high
O’er-top the stone where 1 shall lie,
Though ill or well the world adjust
My slender claim to honored dust,
I shall not question or reply.
I shall not see the morning sky ;
I shall not hear the night-wind sigh ;
I shall be mute, ns all men must
In after days !
But yet, now living, fain were I
That some one then should testify,
Saying— 1 H- held his pen in trust
To Art, not serving shame or lust.”
Will none ? Then let my memory die
In after days!

young men, his success has been almost invariable.

their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded ; the weak and shattered consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN
DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
m.outh on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fearof something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &0.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled

Mr. J. H. WEHR, FARMER,
WASLEYS, S.A. writes:—“l can-
not refrain from adding my testi-
monial to your numerous list. In
justice to science, humanity, and
yourselves I must say that your
treatment of sorrowful afflictions is
past all belief. For seventeen years
I have been a sufferer, and four
months ago I went from bad to
worse ; in fact lost all hope of ever
being well again. When I visited
you I was at once placed under a
course of treatment entirely new to
myself, and from the first I was able to attend to my
occupation as farmer. lam happy to state that lam now
well and better than I have been for years, but shall
follow your advice and take the remedies for some time to
do away with all risk. I shall always remain indebted to
you for my wonderful cure.”
ANTHONY BARRY, Castle Inn,
Hindley-street, Adelaide, writes
“ I will be glad if you will publish
the following- for the benefit of suf-
ferers. For the last five years I
have been in the West, having
worked from Lake Darley to the
Horse Shoe Bend in Murchison.
Nearly the whole of the time I have
been a sufferer from Debility,
and loss of energy, always moping
alone, afraid to join in any
conversation, noises in the ears, and other symp-
toms too numerous to mention ; in fact, was a nuisance
to myself and mates. Tried many advertised remedies
without obtaining any relief. On 1113" way to New Guinea,
and hearing of so many from the West on their way to
other colonies breaking their journey at Adelaide to
obtain .your treatment, I decided to do the same. lam
glad to say I now feel fit to continue my journey without
fear, and am sure I have only to take your remedies a
little longer to obtain a thorough cure. lam well known
in all parts of the West, and write this that my mates and
others may know where they can obtain a certain cure.”

Mr. M. J. DENAHY, Beryl
Street, Broken Hill, writes:—
“ Your remedies have acted
like magic in my case, having
been a sufferer for months
from weakness, and through
weakness I was so ill that f
had to give up work, and I
say truthfully I never thought
I should ever regain my
strength, as I took so much
medicine before seeing you
and without feeling the
slightest bit better, when
fortunately I met a patient of
j'ours, Mr. J. Kent, who
advised me to lose no time,
and, using his own words, he
said : ‘The only chance you
have is to go to Brunswick, Hamilton & Co., who will
very soon put you right,’ and I am thankful I took his
advice, for since I took your remedies l am as well and as
strong as ever I was in my life. I cannot thank you suffi-
cient for what you have done for me.”
REMARKABLE CURE OF DEBILITY. ]
Mr. J. W. AITCHISON, 22 North-st., Adelaide, writes:
—“Gentlemen,—l cannot refrain from addins my testi-
mony to your extraordinary and most marvellous treat-
ment of one of the worst cases of Debility such as mine
was. Since being under your care I can safely say that I
am a strong man once more, and the distressing symptoms
from what I was suffering from have all disappeared in a
most miraculous manner. I had previously been under
the care of five different practitioners for the past four
years ; purchased three different galvanic or electric belts,
without deriving any benefit whatsoever. I had given up
all hope of ever being myself again, when I was recom-
mended to see you. In two weeks’ time I began to feel
improvement, and your remedies did more for me than
the whole four years’ treatment with others. I feel as if
I can never thank you enough, and, as I should like other
sufferers to know what you have done for me, make what-
ever use you like of this.’’
JOSEPH MARTIN, Cen
tral Mine, Broken Hill,
writes “ Accept this tes-
timonial in recognition for
the valuable services you
have rendered me by per-
forming a wonderful cure of
my case, which has been on
me for over five years, and
now that I am well and tell
you that I spent over ±2OO
before consulting you, and
deriving not a farthing’s
worth of benefit from emin-
ent men makes my case one
that other sufferers should
hear about, so that they can
be treated and cured as lam,
and also made strong,
healthy, and happy, which I never thought could be done
until I was a short time under your care. I could con-
tinue for months writing of the misery and anxiety which
I have suffered, and it makes this testimonial pne of great
value, not only to you, but also to those who may be
sufferers like I was, and those that read this and will take
my advice and place their case in your hands will not only
thank you, but also me for making it known to them,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ON THE STAGES THAT ARE DRY.
Slowly o’er the salt-bush ridges see the moving
cattle feed;
Ne’er a gilghi-hole they break for, not a clay-pan
do they heed ;
You can hear contented breathings through the
waning afternoon,
For they’re lately from the waters of a never-dry
lagoon.
It is grand to be a drover when your stores and
roads are right,
But your very heart-strings tighten when the boy
reports* at night:
“ There’s no water for the cattle till you get to
Ginnagay—
To the troughs just past the station, over sixty
miles away ! ”
There are wrinkles on your forehead, and your
heart’s a lump of lead,
Thinking of three double stages and three troub-
lous nights ahead ;
And up-swells an anguished moaning to the
sullen autumn sky,
As you force the dumb brutes forward through
the stages that are dry.
Onward through the choking dust-clouds, down
the twining, blinding track,
To the front the strong are moving, whilst the
weak are falling back ;
Closely guarded by the mud-tank just abreast the
western wing,
Tailing off and stretching forward, in a far-extend-
ing string.
One by one they lift their faces in a pitiful appeal,
As they scent the private waters that the coola-
bahs conceal;
Then it’s “ Back, you sniffing brindle ! there’s a
boundary-rider there,
If he had the river Murrav he would still refuse
your prayer.”
Onward o’er the blazing sandhills to the clink of
bit and bar ;
Flanked by barren flats and ridges where the well-
stocked warrens are;
All the pangs of thirst concentred in each dumb
brute’s sunken eye—
Oh, it’s hell to be a drover on the stages that are
dry!
Some are crippled, some exhausted ; all are lowing
sadly weak ;
There are many left to perish where a sand-streak
marks the creek ;
You can see the front lot stringing, but the tail is
out of sight,
They begin the stage at dawning that the strong
ones made last night.
There beneath that rising dust-cloud are the leaders
miles away,
Rushing wildly in their madness to the troughs at
Ginnagay.
Says-your true and thorough stockman, “ I could
just sit down and cry ”
For it’s hell to be a drover on the stages that are
dry !
E. S. SORENSON.
HERE’S TO YER!
Ring, bells, to the high, high wind !
For this is the morn of the year
When care is cast behind
And we drink to the world good cheer.
A flagon fill first for the sailor who thinks of the
girls ashore,
Fill a mug for the stunted tailor, for the maid a
goblet more.
Fill a cup for the sighing lover, a glass for the
bushman brown,
Bring the teamster, reaper and drover ; come, men
from the busy town.
Bring the axeman down from the ranges ; come,
counsel and lawyer lean,
Ye brokers and agents on ’changes, come up to
the world’s canteen.
Come, miners and merchants and judges ; come,
pressman, parson and priest.
Bring the shepherds in from the ridges to join in
the cheer and the feast.
The wise men, the vain and the mean men, the
statesmen looking profound,
The dull men, the fat, and the lean men, all help
the world to go round.
Yes, come all ye foolish and wise ones, and bury
your petty feuds ;
Come heavy and light and good-sized ones, come
belles with your mincing dudes ;
And gather around all the kind ones, and those
who have had hard fare—
The laine and the halt and the blind ones ; let all
in the season share.
Yes, gather in too from the byeways the friend-
less poor and the sad,
Ye rich who know but the high ways—bring shekels
these hearts to make glad.
Sing hey for Smiling Pleasure ! drink deep to
Dimpled Mirth !
Pour forth the foaming measure—“ Good Luck to
all the Earth ! ”

BURIED AT SEA.
I would be still —
Oh, mighty Power, be still and let me sleep !
“Is there no rest ? Must I forever stray
In this blind, aimless, all-unknowing way?
Was life to me so calm, so quiet a thing
That Death must keep me ever hurrying
Through this vague world of waters ? Wide,
wide world
Of dead monotony 1 And Death is full,
Full of its awful voice, its restless roar,
The booming thunders of its ceaseless war
With wind and shore. Oh, mighty Power, be still,
Be still and let me sleep !
There is no rest 1
Strange scaly things and grim leviathans
Do nudge and nuzzle me in wonder whence
This shapeless, long white-shrouded thing hath
come—

SATURDAY, JANUARY 1, 1898.
The Partition of John Chinaman.
The partition of Poland was an interesting
circumstance, but historically it will not be
reckoned a patch upon the partition of
China—if that event comes off as suggested
by the Ivolnische Zeituno, a German news-
paper generally very well informed as to the
proceedings of its Government. Europe has
suffered a good deal from Asia : but if, in
addition to what it has swallowed already,
Europe devours an Empire of 4,218,401 sq.
miles and 402,680,000 people—or even
if it contents itself with China Proper,
which contains merely 1,336,841 sq.
miles and 386,000,000 people —it will
have very effectually squared the account.
Then the recollection of the time when
Asia was lively, and the Mongols drove
the Turks so far that there was great trouble
in preventing them from getting into Vienna,
will grow so faint that it will be practically
invisible. And there is no expectation
that the descendants of the men who licked
the men who for three centuries were a
terror to Europe will make much more than
a pretence of effective resistance to the
annexation by European powers of the most
fertile and important provinces of their
country.
* * * »
Apparently the partition has already com-
menced. It is announced that by an agree-
ment between Russia, Germany, and France,
Russia—-which has already stolen a good
half of Manchuria—proposes now to steal
the other half; also the quasi-independent
peninsula of Corea, and “ the whole of the
noz’th-eastern province of China down to
the province of Shantung.” This seems
to mean that the Russian grab will
include part of the coast of the Gulf
P e ; Chi - li, so. that Pekin—if his
capital is left to the Chinese Emperor—will
altogether 1< >se its direct connection with the
sea via Tientsin. At a rough estimate,
Russia will add to her territory and popula-
tion a trifle of 470,0005 q. miles and 25,000,000
people—and with no trouble at all but the
trouble of putting out her grimy hand and
taking them. This brings the eastern wing
of Russia-in-Asia down to the 40th parallel ;
and, thanks to the previous annexation of
I urkestan, her western wing is even lower,
so she can move her centre forward when-
ever it suits her to absorb Mongolia and its
desert desert or pasture is all one’ to
Russia.
* * * *
Germany’s share of the loot is the valuable
province of Shantung, with four large coal-
fields and good prospects of iron, gold, and
other minerals ; with many fine harbors,
splendid agricultural valleys, and with the
Hwang-ho and its floods to regularly wash
the surplus population out to sea. Shan-
tung’s area is only 53,762 sq. miles, or not
quite half as much as Prussia’s ; but it is the
most thickly-populated province in China,
bar one, its total of 36 millions beating
Prussia’s by five. France’s share, the
Fukien province, is a little farther down the
coast, on the way to Anam ; and, if France
can see her way to annex Kwangtung later
on, her Asiatic territories will join hands
along an elegant strip of seaboard. Probably
Britain would object, however, for Hong-
kong is on the Kwangtung coast, and Canton
is the Kwangtung capital ; and France, by
collaring Fukien, has already jumped the two
treaty ports of Amoy and Foochow. Fukien is
the most thickly-populated province of China,
going 22 millions to 38,500 sq. miles, or
574 per sq. mile. Fukien is one of the
principal tea-provinces ; and its exports
total about £5,000,000 per annum. And
France is to take Formosa—Formosa, ceded
to Japan by China after the recent war, and
if Japan objects, Russia, Germany and
France are to combine to smash her ! The
partition is worthy of Napoleon, with a
dash of Metternich and Peter the Great
thrown in.
* * * *
Japan and Britain are very much out in
the cold. The most important territorial
grab of the century has been carried through
without them. The seizure of Formosa is a
severe blow to Jap vanity, swollen to
arrogance by her victories over China ; yet
she can only sit and fume. To fight three
Great Powers at once is a contmct from
which even the rashest Little Brown Man
may well shrink. And the Little Brown
Man can reflect, as he impotently bites his
fingers, that he himself is in great part
responsible for his humiliation. Before the
Chino-Jap war it was with very good reason
surmised that China was worthless as
a fighting power; but the proof was
not absolute—or, rather, though it was
mathematically absolute, it was not visible to
the naked eye. Japan conclusively showed
that the Chinese army was a nonentity, the
Chinese navy a cipher, and the Chinese
commissariat a chaos. Then, doubtless
at Russia’s suggestion, the curious trio of
Powers decided that, as the joint was hot,
they might as well carve it. The carving
has been done with admirable skill ; and the
shock to the British Cabinet may be
imagined. It is always a shock to Britain to
find that other Powers are capable of devour-
ing weaker peoples piecemeal in the fashion
of which she has been the chief modern ex-
ponent ; and one may safely wager that, at
this moment, the British press is howling the
whole gamut from surprise to rage and in-
dignation. Britain, who grabbed India, who
grabbed North America, who grabbed Aus-
tralia, who grabbed a hundred other items of
territory, large or small, and missionaried or
murdered the aboriginal inhabitants out
of existence, is convinced that she alone
grabs by right Divine, and that the grab
of every other nation is directly impelled
from the Pit. But Britain no more than
Japan dares tackle the three Powers.
Europe is beginning to do without Britain,
much to the latter’s astonishment ; and
though foolish Britons bellow defiance,
sensible Britons by no means relish the
“ splendid isolation ” —of an old wolf at the
tail of a hungry pack. And the partition of
China without Britain’s knowledge or con-
sent is an ominous answer to the bombast of
Queen Victoria’s jubilee.
* * * *
Yet it is not very clear what benefit Ger-
many and France ai’e going to derive from
becoming Russia’s catspaws—beyond the
certainly immense benefit of conciliating
Russia for European-concert-purposes in
the present. Russia is at home in Asia :
a Tartar at heart, she knows how to
rule a Tartar; and the Tartars have
long known how to rule the Mongols. But
Germany is far from home, and France is
as far. Both nations have learnt that their
permanence as first-rank powers, in view of
the ever-increasing might of America and
Russia, depends upon expansion at home or
abroad ; and as expansion at home means
bloody war both nations are making sacrifices
to establish colonies abroad after the British
fashion. But neither French nor Ger-
man colonies seem to prosper, and the men
and money taken to maintain them can ill be
spared from the armed camps in Europe.
Possibly, with no Chinese opposition, it
may be possible to farm the most fruitful
Chinese provinces at a profit ; but if the
partition goes on, as is its inevitable ten-
dency, it looks as if Germany and
France might find they have bitten more
than they can chew. That was the mistake
Spain made with America. For she tried
to spread herself over not Mexico only,
not Peru only, but over the whole of South
America; and she spread herself out too
thin. She did not keep South America,
and the struggle cost her so much that
she fell from a first-rate to a third or
fourth - rate power, and looks perma-
nently fixed at that. And just as Eng-
land gained by Spain’s loss, so Russia
will gain by the loss of France and Germany
—if they eventually have to fall back from
Asia as Spain fell back from America.
Then, having assimilated China as she
assimilated Poland, and her Caucasian
and Armenian provinces, and Siberia, and
Turkestan, and all her other wonderful ac-
quisitions since the days of Ivan 111., Russia
may turn to the East and then ?
* » * *
This is vague and far-away speculation, for
Russia will agree to much in Europe and
Africa for the sake of a free hand in Asia,
and there is enough of Asia left to mono-
polise her energies for a good many years to
come. What seems reasonably certain is
that the aggregation of peoples called the
Chinese Empire, after having preserved a
separate individuality and history through
ages which have seen a score of first rate
nations rise from darkness and perish in
oblivion, has commenced to fall to pieces
under the most favorable' auspices, and with
the greatest possible chance of continuing
to fall until the pieces are unidentifiable.
As a vast historical institution, the Chinese
Empire is the most aged and most respect-
able item on earth. It was living under just
and enlightened laws centuries before Solon
saw light, and when Justinian’s ancestors
of the fiftieth generation had never been
dreamt of. Its literature was classic when
the Eastern world could neither read nor
write ; and its philosophers speculated and
experimented when the prehistoric propa-
gator of Isaac Newton was a hardshell
savage making barely-articulate noises when
he wanted a bone. Away back in anti-
quity it invented printing, and gunpowder,
and similar notions, and grew tired
of them long before modern science was
in its swaddling-clothes. The mind may
travel back past the glories of Rome, and
Carthage, and Greece, until it comes in
Europe to a dead wall, on the other side of
which is utter darkness, and still there is a
settled government in China, and arts
flourish, and books are written, and theatres
are open, and young men with slanting eyes
are running over willow-pattern plates with
moon faced young women, through a country
where fantastic pagodas lean to canals flow-
ing under impossible bridges, and dragons fly
under trees clipped like whales looking out
of fifth-storey windows. And, in the after-
dinner hush of Christmas Day, The Bulletin
beckoned to a passing vegetable John and
laid these solemn matters before him, and
enquired if he was acquainted with Mene,
Mene, and likewise with '1 ekel, Upharsin,
and whether he knew his ancient empire was
about to be swallowed by the Medes and
Russians, and the Flowery Land was going
to be trodden flat under the iron heel of a
foreign militarism. And that vegetable John
sadly and emphatically replied, “ No savee ! ”
Maoriland's Middle-Class Women.
“ A Rabid Englishman ” to The Bulletin :
The extension to the masses of a university education,
never abundantly successful in Europe, reaps disaster in
countries remote from the large centres of the civilised
world. The seething- discontent in Maoriland feminine
circles is the digestion of the pudding that many politi-
cians h ive evolved out of women's education. Maori-
land is suffering acutely from over-education of its
women. Parents of all classes concentrate their energies
to the end that the girls of the family should gain univer-
sity honors —to what purpose ?
* * * *
The children of the past decade are growing up, and,
with the children of this, constitute in themselves an
educational revolution. The girls are better educated
than the boys. Consumed by a conscious egoism, the New
Maoriland woman is devoid of the elegances of affectation.
Her ambitions are petty, her views of life strictly limited.
Her emotions are the ferment of the brain, arid shq has
ceased to believe in the existence of heart. Possessing
neither tenderness nor sympathy, she is capable of doing
a kind action without,believing it to be such. The train-
ing she undergoes is not calculated to make her appear to
any great advantage. She rides with spirit, plays lawn-
tennis, golf and croquet energetically, and dances prettily.
She thrives best beyond the trammels of civilisation, and
mopes under restraint. Her spirits are light, her
laughter joyous ; in the backwoods she is eminently com-
panionable ; but when fettered by the conventionalities
of a town she rings artificially, and originates an impres-
sion in a stranger’s mind that may not be altogether
groundless.
♦ * m *
Practical is written across M.L. women’s brows, and it
spoils their faces. A little less study and a great deal
more daintiness would blend better with their component
characteristics. Womanliness appeals to the world, and
the world of a woman in Maoriland is principally mascu-
line. Yet a want of tact is worse than a want of virtue.
• * * *
The sincerity of the Maoriland girl is the frankness
emanating from a life that points to Nature as its main-
spring. All paths touch somewhere the pastoral and
agricultural pursuits of the province, and by this contact
the freedom of the country influences the artificial con-
ditions paramount in towns. The contrast on a change
of circumstances is accepted with great pluckiness, and
in the marriage of the period in Maoriland such a con-
trast is usually present. The wife assists her husband in
his fight, and by her sole exertions settles the conduct of
the establishment. In England, the principle of marrying
under straitened circumstances and struggling to im-
provement is viewed askance ; but in Maoriland, girls
reared in comparative comfort seize the occasion, and,
striving pertinaciously, slowly float, to stages of affluence.
This trait in a character so complex suggests that their
selfishness is superficial, and their generosity dormant.
» * * *
Entertaining is treated with supreme indifference. The
hospitality is charming, even lavish in the generosity ex-
tended. No request is untoward. The guest comes and
goes, and advent or departure creates no diversion. The
even tenor of the way steadily progresses, and is in-
variably dull. Dinners are rather terrible ; the clever
people’never listen, the stupid people never talk.
Courses are generally eaten in dead silence. The hostess is
nervous, the host sleepy, and the dinner a ghastly gastro-
nomic muddle. The humble chop is elevated to the posi-
tion of a chef-d’ceuvre, and at that has no appreciable
evidence of tenderness.
* * * *
Possessing patience without ambition, self-confidence
without self-esteem, and devoid of the dignity conferred
l, v experience, the M.L. woman of the old school remains
the embodiment of a kindly soul imbued with most
generous instincts. She moons quietly along in the de-
parting footsteps of the age, content to have eradicated
from the education of her children all that was advan-
tageous to herself. In consequence, the Maoriland
maiden is a farrago of inadequacies—energetic without
elegance, active without grace, loquacious without wit,
mistaking bustle for style, raillery for badinage, noise for
gaiety. It is difficult to determine the responsibility for
the conduct of the provincial minx. Morally culpable the
parents may be, but the influence of systematic studies is
the more potent factor. The ethics of pleasant conversa-
tion they have never acquired ; the principles of dressing
are too intricate. It is wrong to imagine that the women
do not know how to dress ; they do, but they don’t do it
properly. Some women obtain their clothes from England,
and, when they are well-groomed, do credit to their
tailors. Principally, however, they are at a loss to know
what to wear, or how to wear it. The crisis typifies a
wholesale slaughter of existing fashions. The result is
crude, occasionally bizarre, seldom artistic. Of English
poets the ordinary Maoriland woman knows little; of
Continental writers in any capacity she knows less.
She may perhaps pay greater attention to music. Her
artistic appreciation is neither deep nor fervent. When
she plays, her music has no soul; and when she sings,
her soul has no voice.
• * * *
As a country' delivered to the tender mercies of the
advanced woman, Maoriland attempts to exploit any
movement that will keep her subdued. The allotment
of the franchise was signally weak. The sop to Ckr-
bkrus is only temporary. If a dog growls and is fed,
on the morrow he wiil growl again. Franchise has
raised a particular species of rabid femininity in Maori-
land, and what conjuration will exorcise it only Satan
knows. The section preaches partial impact, and at
gatherings of partisans talks volubly of political rotten-
ness and social reform. These views of reform induce
their holders to wear bloomers under skirts, to vaunt
their independence of men and even manners, to
blatantly nurture “prohibition,” and to irritate their
party with imbecile criticisms and hamper it by womanly
mutations. The political woman has become a nuisance.
She is anxious to retain all the privileges of her sex
and Secure besides all those of man. She wants to be
a man and remain a woman. She will not become a
man, and it will be a public blessing when she ceases
to be a woman.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Approaching Fall.
Apparently the mana of Richard Seddon is
a diminishing quantity. The Maoriland session
just closed has been the most disastrous one
since the beginning of the Liberal regime seven
years ago. Seddon’s absence in England was
the beginning of the trouble ; he came back
with a title and the trail of the Jubilee grovel
upon him, and the ill-luck which seems to
attend so many Premiers who go wandering
BIJLL-wards has been more or less with him
ever since. He came back to find that his locum
tenens, big “ Jock ” M'Kenzie, had been run-
ning amok in his absence, and had lost no
chance of saying something foolish, or doing
something large and honest and clumsy and
elephantine. It would have taxed the resources
of a far more diplomatic man than Seddon to
explain away “ Jock ” M‘Kenzte’s sayings and
doings, and the M.L. Premier didn’t even try.
The tales of the Jubilee grovel followed
Richard of Kumara back to Wellington, and
made a bad impression on the democratic
Maorilanders. The bill for that same grovel
was a subject of bitter contention, and the
row over the ill - fated account made
more trouble. Then Joseph Ward, the
ex-Treasurer of the Seddon Ministry, re-
appeared in Parliament, an uncertificated insol-
vent, with a somewhat doubtful standing in the
Legislature, and with the moral stench of the
Farmers’ Association and the Colonial Rank
hanging about him like an atmosphere. Sed-
don’s fierce loyalty to his old colleague alienated
much of the snulllesome element of the House
of Representatives, and the rumor that Joseph
Ward might even resume his old place at the
Treasury was a cause of bitter anger. The pur-
chase of the Bushy Park estate from theB.N.Z.
by Minister M‘Kenzie’s sons aroused a storm
of peculiar intensity. The proposed vote of
censure on Seddon himself for holding a paid
billet with a British mining syndicate was
almost carried by an Opposition, several of the
leaders of which themselves hold paid billets
with British and other land syndicates, and,
though the Government held its own, it did it
by a very narrow majority, and the Liberal
party split badly over the question. All through
the session a bitter, continuous stonewall was
kept up by the Tory party and the fragmentary
sept led by Stout, the renegade Radical of
Dunedin. And the Legislative Council rose
definitely in revolt, and deliberately re-
jected every progressive measure sent up
to it. The Old Age Pensions Bill was lost
in the nominee chamber ; also the measure
for the restriction of alien immigration, the
Wages Protection Bill, and the Apprentices
Bill—a measure designed to put down some of
the worst forms of sweating. The prospects of
all these, and of the State Fire Insurance
scheme, look quite as hopeless for next session—
in fact, it has become evident that either the
Upper House must be reformed or the Liberal
movement must stop short. Therefore, Pre-
mier Seddon has formally declared gory war
against the Council, and has practically staked
the existence of his Government on the issue.
But his majority in the House of Representa-
tives is comparatively small now ; there seems
a chance of the Opposition being strength-
ened shortly by the substitution of Stout as
leader for the impossible Russell ; the down-
fall of Joseph Ward has weakened the
Ministry; it is weighed down by the dead
weight of M‘Kenzie ; and Seddon’s title is
against it; and the Jubilee legends are against
it; and Seddon himself is a weary Titan
struggling under the burden of too many port-
folios (he carries six of them in all), growing
old and a little broken, soured by the bitter
politics of a province where politics are more
bitter than in any other of the Australias, and
with his many good works already beginning to
he forgotten. Judging by present appearances
the mana of old sturdy Digger Dick will just
about last another session.
A European Trouble.
It has become a kind of legend in Europe that
centuries have a habit of closing with a huge
political convulsion, and there is a vague feeling
afloat that the break-up of the Austrian empire
maybe the boss convulsion which will celebrate
the end of the 19th century. Nobody really
knows how that harlequin state has held to-
gether so long. It consists of eighteen distinct
nations and tribes, and a few fragments that
are not large enough to be called tribes. It


includes more languages than it is easy to count.
Almost every one of its multitudinous clans
hates the other seventeen with a fine old crusted
hatred whose beginnings date back to the days
of the Roman empire or thereabouts. They
came together by accident ; some of them are
there because they were driven southward by
the old Gothic irruptions ; some because they
were elbowed eastward by the Romans and
Franks ; some because they were chased north-
ward by Greeks and Turks and others ; some
because the Tartars harried them out of the
East. The debris of a multitude of races came
together with a clash in the centre of Europe,
and remained there for want of any other place
to go. Hardly any of them are strong enough
to stand alone, and for several centuries the
Austrian Kaisers have tried to make them into
a nation—sometimes by diplomacy, brute force,
and persecution ; sometimes by granting liberal
political institutions, when they couldn’t well
help it, and trying to promote education, and
endeavoring to rub off the sharp angles of racial
hatreds. The unwieldy empire always seemed
to totter on the verge of a precipice. For a
century or more the real Austria was a strag-
gling fly-speck on the map, holding down
Bohemia with one hand and trying to hold
down Hungary with the other, and fighting for
its life against the stupendous power of Turkey
at the same time. It was twice all but wiped
off the map of Europe by the Ottomans, and
each time it came to life again, and after
standing the whole brunt of the great Ottoman
invasion for 200 years, it finally sat down hard
on its enemy and got him into a better frame
of mind. For very many years it lived in a
state of periodical civil war; the revolt of
Bohemia was only a shade less regular than
the uprising of Hungary, and the uprising of
Hungary was only a shade less regular than the
sunrise, and the yearning of Hungary and Tran-
sylvania to tear each other to pieces was the next
most reliable thing to the chronic struggle for the
possession of Servia and the chronic row about
the Bavarian frontier. Even now, the motley
empire seems as far from being consolidated as
ever it was. It has apparently settled down
to argue out once more the old soul-filling row
between the great German and non-German
elements, and, if the latter comes on top, its
many component parts will then have to argue
things out among themselves. The general
idea is that something will burst when Kaiser
Francis Joseph goes to sleep with his troubled
fathers, and Kaiser Francis Joseph is very
old now, and is the head of a mentally-deranged
family, which badly needs to marry its cook,
and bring new blood into the veins of the
debilitated Caesars. The Austrian empire, if
it once bursts, has a fair show of being the
biggest problem Europe has had on hand for
two centuries.
The Appointment of Justices.
The proper mode of appointing justices of the
peace, now that the present political back-door
system stands condemned, is by no means clear.
Broadly speaking, there are two courses open—
a nominee system and an elective system. The
present is a nominee system, but is susceptible
of much improvement without the necessity of
adopting the other. This may be done either
by restricting the nominating class, or by pre-
scribing qualifications for the nominated per-
sons. Various proposals have been made in
these two directions. It has been suggested,
for instance, that the power of nomination
should be confined to Supreme Court Judges, or
to the Attorney-General, or Minister of Justice.
The objections of want of knowledge of local
requirements, and of a tendency to select people
of “society” standing, may be urged against
the one proposal, and the stronger objection
that it is what the present system is in theory,
against the other. As to the idea of qualified
nominees, there are no great difficulties. What
test should be applied to ascertain the
qualification? Who would apply it ? What is
a qualification ? The last difficulty raises the
old question as to whether justices of the peace
should be learned in the law, or merely
possessed of average common-sense and intel-
ligence, and should be honest. The great
danger in the “ qualified nominee” proposal is
that “social standing” would gain the day,
and that, therefore, boodledom and its variants
would acquire a secure tenure of the justice-
ship of the peace. The elective system has
much to recommend it theoretically and as a
democratic proposition. But there are serious
practical objections against it. The people are
unused to the idea of elected dispensers of jus-
tice ; there are dangers of corruption to ensure
re-election or to reward services on polling-
day ; and incompetent money-bags will have
undue chances of election. But probably most
of these objections would vanish with a magis-
tracy paid for its services. Unfortunately, every
Treasurer would see in this proposal an insuper-
able objection. Justicemustcontinuecheap,even
though it have to continue nasty. So many ob-
jections may be urged against every proposal
that it is hard to come to a conclusion : but in
the end it will probably be found that a choice
will have to be made between the nominee pro-
fessionally-educated justice, paid or unpaid,
and the elective paid justice. Higgins’ oues-
tion at the Vic. Law Commission, the other
day, w-as significantly indicative of what that
Commission will probably recommend. It was :
“ Do you see any reason why the maintenance
of justice should be left to amateurs and volun-
teers, any more than the maintenance of rail-
ways or waterworks ? ”
Rough on Drink.
A N.S.W. public servant was charged last
week with embezzlement upon his own confes-
sion, and made the usual statement that “the
whole thing had been brought on by Drink.”
The teetotal party alw'ays does a shriek of joy
over this regular and rather monotonous “ con-
fession ” ; almost everybody who does anything
nowadays says—when he is found out and has
to say something—that it was all the result of
Drink ; and The Bulletin, being a trifle weary
of that shriek, desires to say something on the
other side of the case. In the first place, the
first instinct of anybody who has done any-
thing illegal is to say that it was done by
somebody else. Even Adam of Genesis said
that the other fellow did it. When that falls
through, about the only other thing to say is
that it was all caused by the Der-rink. In
former days, the same kind of offender used to
say he was bewitched ; the only reason why
he doesn’t say that now is that no
modern jury believes in witchcraft. In
still earlier days it was the custom to
say that the devil called on him personally
with his visible tail hanging down behind him,
and drove him to crime, and he would say that
still if there was any reasonable chance of the
court believing in the personal visit of the
devil. If scientific knowledge were more gene-
ral than it is, he would probably tell the arrest-
ing constable when the attempt to lay the
crime at the door of the other fellow had failed
7 that he was to all intents and purposes as
innocent as the new laid snowball, and that the
crime was caused by cocaine, or ether, or mor-
phia, or hypnotic suggestion by some person or
persons unknown, or by the interference of
astral bodies or elementary spirits, or it arose
through male hysteria, spinal meningitis, gene-
ral paralysis of the insane in its early stages,
heredity, temporary mental derangement arising
from the fumes of green coffee, or something
else equally profound. But, as the witch and
the devil have gone, and the other things
haven’t yet fairly arrived, the Drink is, for the
moment, the oidy thing that a man can ascribe
his crime to, when the attempt to shift it on to
someone else has failed. The jury wouldn’t
understand the other things, and the arrest-
ing constable couldn’t spell them when he put
down tiie remark on his note-book, and the
accused himself probably never heard of them.
Moreover, by putting it down to the Drink the
accused individual enlists the sympathy of the
large teetotal section of the community, and
there is a fair chance that the teetotal part of
the jury will insist on a strong recommenda-
tion to mercy—whereas the cocaine or hysteria
theories appeal to no large community of
cranks, and pay no dividends worth mention-
ing. And, though the accused may have lied
in the first place by saying he didn’t commit the
crime, and in the second place by saying the
other fellow did it, when he makes his third
excuse to the effect that it was all caused by
Drink, the teetotal community always regards
t lat third shuffle as a matter which requires no
proof whatever. However great a liar the
arrestee may be in other matters, his absolute
truthfulness, when he puts his offence down to
Drink, is always accepted. Which is pretty
rough on Drink.
Judge Hood, in addressing a Melb. jury in a
recent seduction case: “In assessing damages
they would also bear in mind that the parties
were not in very high-class society. A pound
or two to a person in humble circumstances was
of more importance than £lO to a person in a
high social position. In dealing with wealthy
people the jury would give heavier damages.”
And again : “ They would consider, in this
case, what they would give the mother as com-
pensation for her injured feelings and the dis-
grace to her family.” It is satisfactory thus to
have an authoritative declaration from the
Supreme Court bench that the feelings of a poor
woman are not worth so much as those of a
“ person in high society.” Also, the honor of a
daughter of wealthy parents is worth more
than that of a poor girl, which explains why a
poor man who steals a few shillings gets 12
months, while the “ person in high society,”
who swindles bank-depositors, is discharged in
great haste. If it had been the defendant, in-
stead of the plaintiff and her family, who was in a
humble position, an order to pay £1 might be a
heavier punishment in his case than the loss of
£lO in someone else’s. That would at least
have been a logical statement, and on that
basis the poor man who seduced the rich man’s
daughter might, with some show of fairness,
get off more cheaply than the rich man who
seduced the daughter of humble parents. But
the theory that the rich man should get off
more cheaply if he seduced the daughter of a
plasterer than if he led astray the daughter of
a banker, simply on the ground that a plas-
terer’s daughter doesn’t matter much, is an
undisguised acknowledgment that there is one
law for the rich and another for the poor

Mr. Jno. M. Creed, M. L. C., writes :
Ed. Bulletin, —I have carefully considered the'case of
Suffield, now undergoing imprisonment on conviction
for a criminal assault upon Anne Chambers as set forth
in the pamphlet issued from the office of Tiie Bulletin
newspaper. *
. the essential point in the case against the prisoner
is his identification by the prosecutrix alone, uncor-
roborated by any other witness, and contradicted by
the evidence of Mrs. Warren and her daughter.
But for the evidence of Anne Chambers herself there is
nothing to connect the prisoner with the case, and her
statements in relation to the assault vary so materially as
to render it, in my opinion, quite unreliable.
There is no evidence other than that of the prosecutrix
to show that the inquiries disclosed by the medical exam-
ination were caused by the assault of any human being,
whilst the very similar bruises and abrasions found by
Dr. Nash on the person of Mrs. Cole, which were unques-
tionably caused by the bull, which was loose in the
grounds at the time Anne Chambers was injured, render
it within the range of probability that her injuries were
caused by the same animal.
In my opinion, there was not evidence of a sufficiently
reliable character to justify conviction.
In a civil action the verdict of a jury is frequently set
aside on appeal to the Full Court on the ground that it
was not supported by evidence, and the enquiry authorised
by section 383 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act
should in criminal cases take the place of the Full Court
in Civil ones.
It is an anomaly of the most objectionable character
that there should be power to upset the verdict in a case
relating to money or property, but not when the liberty
of a possibly innocent man is involved.
I can see nothing in the section which, in my opinion,
justifies a demand for new evidence or facts before such
an enquiry is directed.
I fully realise that the administration of justice should
not be lightly interfered wfith, but cases may arise in
which review of a verdict is necessary in the public well-
being, and it appears to me that the Suffield case is
one of them.—Jjto. M. Creed. Sydney, Dec. 17, 1897.
Kleptomania in well-to-do circles is chronic
theft among the working classes, and gets
punished accordingly. The Argus, in a recent
paragraph, artlessly tells the story of a klepto-
maniac who is evidently doomed to become a
“ habitual criminal.” Some extracts from this
quite unconscious satire on the law. “There
is a prisoner in the Melb. gaol who some months
ago was sent to serve a sentence for theft—a
nice long sentence, evidently. Many charges
were brought against him, which demonstrated
that the man was a lorn thief. . . . Since
li is incarceration he has continued as big a
thief as ever. The other day, when called
before the governor, he stole a pencil
from one of the warders while Captain
Burrows was lecturing him about his con-
duct. . . . He has, while outside prison,
practised the art of theft to such an extent that,
whether he is being watched or not, he always
resorts to strategy to achieve his end.” In fact,
the unfortunate devil whose brain-disease has
brought him to Melbourne gaol is evidently as
expert a kleptomaniac as the late Earl of
Derry and many other high-born thieves—
privileged to practise their art without the
least fear of ever getting inside a prison.
The Seddon Government’s Masters and Appren-
tices Bill, just thrown out by the Legislative
Council, was a praiseworthy attempt to deal
with a really serious evil. In Maoriland, as in
Australia, the apprentice system has almost
died out. In former days masters took appren-
tices for a fixed term of years, at wages which
increased with each year, and with a definite
obligation to thoroughly instruct them in a
trade. The result was that skilled workmen
grew up who knew their trades in every branch.
The newer idea is to engage boys at small
wages for no definite period. There is no obli-
gation to teach them anything, and, as a rule,
they only learn one small branch of the busi-
ness, and even that they learn just sufficiently
to make them useful to their employer for the
moment. In a year or so, when they want
more wages, they are fired out to make room
for other small boys at next to nothing
per week, or often at nothing at all—-merely
a promise of something per week in their
“ second year.” In such cases they are very
seldom kept on after the first year. The re-
sult is that the new local generation seldom
really knows any trade ; in most factories
where skilled labor is required it comes in its
grown-up state from Europe—just enough of it
to boss the temporary Maoriland small boy,
whose fate is to be a Touseabout all the days of
his life. The Seddon Government proposed to
meet this evil by absolutely prohibiting the
employment of the small boy at no wages, and
compelling masters to take apprentices instead.
In other words, it proposed to provide technical
instruction for the rising generation, and at the
same time to revert to a fine, ancient, respectable
system. But the Council called the ancient
respectable system a “dangerous socialistic ex-
periment,” and bounced the fine old precedent
down the stairs by a large majority.
An item of evidence in a recent Melbourne suit
is calculated to make the public get away by
itself in a dark corner and shudder. A doctor
was being sued for £5OOO damages for the
alleged unskilful botching of a patient, and the
usual professional brother got into the witness-
box to swear on behalf of defendant. Under
cross-examination this brother acknowledged
that there is a standing arrangement among
doctors to give evidence on each other’s behalf
when necessary. He didn’t say exactly how
hard they agreed to swear on each other’s
account, but the view that is likely to occur to
the public is this : If the profession is only
going to swear the truth and not a hair’s-
breadth more than the truth on behalf of the
sawbones who is in difficulty, then there is no
apparent need of any arrangement. Every
witness undertakes to tell the truth, and it
doesn’t require arranging. Then what does the
profession arrange ? As a rule there are only
two things about evidence that really need to be
arranged—one is to suppress the truth more or
less, and the other is to tell the truth as in-
accurately as circumstances may call for. Sup-
posing a doctor, by hideously unskilful treat-
ment, permanently disables a brick - laying
patient, and the latter wants damages. Appa-
rently the arrangement implies that the pro-
fession will either actively swear in favor of the
doctor, or if the case is too awful for that, will
at least swear as little as it possibly can on
behalf of the bricklayer. And if these are the
conditions, what show has any bricklayer ?
That alleged arrangement in the medical pro-
fession seems, in the interests of justice, to call
for a whole lot of investigation.
The five points of the People’s Charter fought
for by Englishmen when Australia was a penal
colony, were universal suffrage, vote by ballot,
equal electoral districts, triennial Parliaments,
and payment of members. The Chartists meant
by “ universal” adult male suffrage—and they’re
still far from it. Their Parliament also runs
seven years and payment of members is still in
the distance. Equal electoral districts in the
beneficial Chartist sense is not understood, nor
likely to be for some time. Australia, on the
other hand, can be fairly said, in one portion
or another of its territory, to have won the
whole five points. On universal suffrage it, in
some divisions, has “exceeded the wildest
dreams ” of Chartism, for it has given women
votes. And still how much remains to be done.
The five Chartist points are mere portions of
the machine of Government; skill and honesty
are wanted to work the machine.
Not very wise in their generation are the
people who have just hatched-out a fearful and
wonderful scheme for making the gay Gallic
bachelor give hostages to fortune, whether he
likes it or not, by privileging the more prolific
at the expense of the less. Government-licenses
only to fathers of at least three children ;
Government-scholarships only to children of
such fathers; Government posts only to fathers
of more than three children. All which penny-
iu-the-slot business is moonshine, for the simple
reason that if people won’t populate they
won t —and the more they won’t, the bigger
majority there will be of childless and sinall-
familied men to decide what the law shall
be. Moreover, it doesn’t seem as if this
French-Population-Increase-Alliance knows al-
together on which side the national bread is
buttered, else why should it so despondently
compare the French annual population-increase
of 50,000 with the 500,000 of G ermany. What’s
Germany going to do with her swarms, unless
she parts with them for the benefit of newer
nations, or cuts her own throat by adding her
increase to the monstrous military burden
which is already straining to the utmost her
industrial back ? And, as France isn’t going
backwards at all events, she might very well
cease from troubling and let the revanche slide.
She had her own day of invasion and glory and
arrogance, and the 1870 war was, after all, only
a German revanche. So that honors are easy.
Now that the minimum affirmative vote re-
quired to adopt Federation in N.S. W. has been
raised to 80,000, will the Reid Government give
the cause of Australian nationhood at least
some kind of a show by .taking the Federation
vote and the General Election on the same day ?
If the Melbourne Convention prepares a consti-
tution it will be ready to be voted upon by
March or April. The Assembly must dissolve
early in August in any case—probably it will
have to dissolve before the end of June so as to
prevent the Government going to the country
with another deficit. The two votes could
easily be taken simultaneously. It would save
a large sum in expenses, and it should make it
comparatively easy to get 80,000 votes, or even
more, on an abstract question, where otherwise
the odds are very much against anything like
that number being obtained. The Federal
party in Parliament, if there is one, should try
the effect of a real hard kick on this issue.
The S.M. Herald, in the unusual role of law-
reformer, remarks that the sole qualification
for a juror should be his elector’s right. The
idea is not new. The franchise is the test of
jury-qualification in several parts of Europe.
Many of the evils attributed to the jury system
of Britain and Australia spring from the cur-
rent notion as to what constitutes the qualifi-
cation for the office of juror. It is not
maturity, judgment, or learning that is
sought; the sheriff (or the police) draws up the
list on a strict property basis. This actually
vitiates the primary idea of a jury of one’s
peers. The “ twelve good men and true ”
should be the average men met on the street,
and the only way to make sure of getting this
principle into operation is to regard citizenship
as the sole qualification. A jury picked on any
other qualification is virtually a sheriff or
police-made body.

Editor Buzacott, M.L.C. (Q.), is quite right
in protesting against the present absurd method
of amending clauses in Bills, by moving little
changes one by one till everj'one is hopelessly
bewildered. “Mr. President, I-beg to move
that, in the above sentence, the word ( right ’
in line 2be struck out.” That being done, an-
other motion is made to insert “ wrong,” or
“ astray,” or anything. Next, somebody bobs
up to insert an “and” or an “or” or a “ but ”
somewhere or other, and, if something has been
missed in line 4 and the Committee has dealt
with an “ if ” in line 5, line 4 can’t be gone back
to until the whole bill has been right through
Committee. Buzacott tells Row, in his days
(which was about the time wlien “ the Assyrian
came down like a wolf on the fold ”), if they
wanted to amend a clause, they simply threw
the thing into the w.p. basket and produced a
whole new clause, ready-made, just as a con-
juror produces a pumpkin from your left ear
and you wonder how you never knew it was
there. Buzacott’s plan is the plan. Yet none
of the Australian Parliaments adopts it.
The Suffield Case.
PRESS COMMENTS.
Says Albury (N.S.VV.) Daily News of Nov. 29:
‘ Having- read the whole of the evidence and the reports
of the manner of the trial, we have come to the conclusion
that this case embodies one of the most cruel and mon-
strous miscarriages of justice ever perpetrated in any
part of the British dominions where trial by jury is in
force. . . . And the only possible explanation is that here
again the late Judge Windeyer brought his dominating
mind into force and reduced the jury to that mental con-
dition of acquiescence in his callous will which was
responsible for so many brutal travesties of justice in this
colony.”
Writes “ Saladin ” in Orange (N.S.W.) Leader of Dec.
4 : “ A calm, dispassionate consideration of the evidence
would lead any ordinary person to conclude that the case
against Suffield was very weak indeed.”
The Beacon : “ The case is emphatically one for en-
quiry.”
The North Rockhampton (Q.) Times, in a leading article
on Dec. 4, says : “ We have read the pamphlet from its
commencement to the end, and rise from its perusal with
the thorough conviction that the man who is suffering
penal servitude was no more guilty of committing the
offence than the writer of these lines." And the w l iter
adds : “ The case under review is by no means the only-
instance of the miscarriage of Justice in N.S. Wales. In
the chaplain’s book in Maitland Gaol there was, and pre-
sumably now is, a quaint but significant entry : ‘ G. K.
Rusden, to take leave of Roger, an aboriginal - , who has
been pardoned for the crime it was proved he had never
committed.’” The writer goes on to relate how some
years ago he was chaplain of Maitland Gaol. “At one of
the semi-annual Assizes a Chinaman named Ah Veil was
convicted of the murder of a countryman at Port Stephens
and sentenced to be hanged. The gallows was erected!
the hangman had arrived from Sydney, and the execution
was fixed to take place on the following morning. On the
previous evening something occurred which raised grave
doubts in the chaplain’s mind as to the guilt of the
prisoner. He wired to Mr. Charles Cowper, then Colonial
Secretary, and asked for a respite of three days. A
favorable answ-er was returned. Next morning, accom-
panied by two sergeants of police and the interpreter, Go
Pong, the chaplain was in the saddle by daylight, and
after a dreadful ride —for flood waters were out—the place
was reached, and a searching investigation held, with the
result that the unfortunate wretch was found to be the
victim of a conspiracy, and no more guilty of the crime
for which he was convicted and about to be hanged than
anyone who reads these lines. The man is believed to be
alive to this day. It is worthy of note that a then bar-
rister and afterwards a Judge of New South Wales, i n
commenting on the circumstance, observed: 4 Well ’you
had a frightful journey; you ruined a valuable horse;
and for what l Only a poor devil of a Chinaman.’ ”
Yarrawonga (N.S.W.) Chronicle writes on Dec. 7
“ T^ e evidence . . . impresses us with the belief that
there has been a gross miscarriage of justice . . . that
there should be an enquiry is obviously beyond question.”
Sydney Stock and Station Journal, Nov. 30—“ The
circumstances look like, in the first place, a gross miscar-
riage of justice ; and, in the second place, a defiant, pig-
headed refusal of the authorities to re-open the case.”
Sydney Suburban Times, in an article on 4th Dec., 1897,
says “ Perusing the evidence dispassionately, one is
forced to admit that it is so inconclusive that the re-
luctance of the Crown to have further investigation
seems inexplicable.”
Clunes (Vic.) Guardian, in leading article, Dec. 14 -
“The man was tried, convicted, sentenced, when all (he
testimony goes to show that he was not guilty of the
crime imputed to him . . . The evidence, however, col-
lated in proof that Suffield is not guilty, is so conclusive
as to warrant the belief, very strongly expressed in Syd-
ney, that the Govt, dare not reopen the case in fear that
the. proof of their inactivity in the true interests of
justice should be unmistakeably exposed.”
Bundaberg Leader., Dec. B—“ Taking the evidence as
published in this pamphlet it is clear that Suffield was
sent to gaol on the bare assertion of an apparently hvs
terical female who, even in her own statements concern'
mg the matter, contradicts herself repeatedlv n
will appear to everyone reading this ease that'justice his
miscarried.’ J nas

Queen Victoria was one of Mr. Thomas

One of the largest and hottest audiences
that have ever filled a theatre in a perspiring
city graced the opening of Her Majesty’s Panto-
mime on Boxing Night. The stories of “ The
Babes in the Wood ” and “ Bold Robin Hood and
his Merry Men ” have been inextricably mixed by
the man who wrote the “book” for the enter-
prising firm, and through three long acts of
spangled splendor and a scintillating wind-up,
and tangled twin tales meander behind the foot-
lights. All the title rdles are Well played, espe-
cially the Wood, which had a great reception on
its first appearance, and the business of the even-
ing includes a flitterjr-twittery flutter of robin
red breasts and a practical waterfall. The Babes,
represented by Lily Titheradge and Carrie Moore,
are well-grown infants whose principal act con-
sists in not being murdered in the aforesaid Wood.
Miss Carrie, as the boy babe, has nothing to do ;
and Miss Lily, as the girl, still less. Talent
must be plentiful when two such clever girls
are wasted on these tiny parts. The cruel
Uncle, who is also the Sheriff, is a joyful inebriate
consistently and cheerfully' drunk all the time.
Mr. Bert Gilbert, who makes his first appearance
in Sydney in the part, shows a fine artistic sense
in getting to the exact state of muddle likely to
be kept tip through a whole lifetime, for Uncle
looks as if he would never be any drunker than
just that and yet never be quite sober. Also, he
sings in the Wood and quarrels noisily with the
orchestra, and brings on a melancholy dog, and
sools him on to the conductor, and takes strong
convulsions on the stage so that his coat is rent in
twain and turned front-side back, and then he
abruptly flays his dog and leaves Snatcher’s bare
bones bleaching in view of the audience. He also
hires two bravos to slay his relatives, and inserts
both legs into one trouser, and is wheeled home in
a barrow to his ancestral door-way by a strong
bobby, and sleeps in the Wood, and does
a variety turn, with Robin Hood, and takes
part in many siqg-songs, and yet never gets
any drunker and never gets any soberer.
* * * •
Ada Reeve looks good enough to eat as
Robin Hood, and, as a first-night tribute, the con-
tents of so many florists’ shops were handed up
that they had to be lined in front of her along the
stage. Her principal business is singing, with a
shapely band of Merry Men as chorus, and her
figure as a boy is a triumphant success. Alice
Leamar is her sweetheart, Maid Marian, and has
nothing much to do but stand about coyly and
be kissed whenever the interest is flagging. De
Lara, as Dame Durden, makes the Babes’ nurse
an angular Anglican old maid with bloomers and
a bike ; and J. J. Burke and Coleman are two
original villains of the deepest and dustiest hue ;
they look like Dusty Rhodes and Weary Walker,
and have all the heavy tragedy to do in the Wood,
where they have a fight to a finish with gloves on,
and then grope round on their hands and
knees, apparently seeking the thread of the
narrative, which by that time is lost altogether.
They have the best duet in the panto., and a well-
worn practical jokelet, which also is worked up in
the Royal show, of black-chalking each other’s
shirt-front. But they are refreshingly villainous
villains, and the life and soul of the piece. The
wedding-breakfast scene is the poetry of feeding ;
the animated meats and drinks and table-fix-
ings form a gorgeously - swagger bean - feast,
and the other ballets are soul-satisfying so far as
they go, but there is too little dancing and not
one topical allusion. A Xmas panto, ignoring
Federation, and never once referring to the
coming elections, or the Bennett divorce-case,
or the John Norton libel-suit, has an unfinished
aspect. There is one concerted ditty that gives
signs, with careful nourishing and dieting, of
growing into a topical song, but it is very anaemic
and feeble as yet. L. Caron has made some
pretty birdy music for the robins to hop to. There
is plenty of go in the Firm’s effort this year, and
the comedians are bright and clever. With one
or two rattling good songs and a dancing troup
inserted the show would be one vast, solid success.
** * m
“ Charley’s Aunt ” rose again at Sydney
Criterion on Monday night. There was a heavy
sea of humanity breaking over the ticket-office,
and it blew a fierce gale of population on the
stairs, and manager Lohr, in a dismasted condi-
tion and laboring heavily, was visible for a while
trying to direct things, and then foundered in
deep vvater. Apparently the “ Charley’s Aunt ”
boom is a long way from extinction even now.
Frank Thornton comes back the same crinkly
little joy as aforetime, and his two brief
twinklesome comedy legs age not at all. And
as Thornton is, barring the beery Stephen
Spettigue with his hiccup and his dropsical
umbrella, the whole comedy-element of the play,
the fact that he is still in good repair is a sufficient
guarantee of success. The “ Aunt ” can never, as
a work of comedy-art, be quite the triumph that
the “ Private Secretary ” was ; that sad and bun-
struck teacher is a creation such as only comes in
a comedian’s way once in a lifetime; but still the
lady from Brazil is a vast hunk of mirth and glad-
ness, and her struggles to find her rear pocket
are a whole comedy in themselves. A more
detailed notice of Thornton’s deserving show and
the company is regretfully held over till next
week. This devastating red organ has, for various
reasons, to go to press on Tuesday night. And
when Xmas falls on Saturday, and more new
shows than the paper can hold open on Monday
night, and they are all so crowded that sudden
death waits on the stair, the situation is difficult.
Therefore, it is merely necessary to mention that
the co. in general gives satisfaction, and the parts
of it that are more satisfactory than some other
parts will be particularised in a future issue. Also
any parts which are not distinctly satisfactory
thus get a chance to improve, and the chastening
axe of criticism is suspended for one week.

It was a very hot and abundant audience
that took a violently perspiring interest, on Mon-
day night, in the new and amended version of the
history of Richard Whittington, Esquire, and his
alleged Oat, as presented at Sydney Lyceum. In
fact, said Cat, of the dimensions and color of an
elderly leopard in extreme disrepair, pervades the
piece so autocratically that even Harry Shine —as
a Dame Durden of much tonnage and a mani-
fest determination to boss the entire show —is
fain to take a second place of the most second-
ary kind. Despite the overshadowing char-
acter of the animal, however, Shine gets a
fair show to assert himself as a dancer and
takes the bun from all competitors—panted or
petticoated. The dancing throughout is so good
that it makes the musical side of the entertain-
ment look comparatively one-horse and apologetic.
A special exception is made with regard to the
chanty ” voiced by about the most silver-piped
and apple-bowed and liberally-pooped ship’s com-
pany that never bunked for’ard with the ’roaches.
The said company coolly—contrary to all nautical
statutes in that case made and provided—retires
into the saloon of its good ship, the “old man”
being presumably just then perched upon the
mizzen-royal yard with a revolver trying to hold
his own against an aggravated mutiny.
* • * *
‘ 4 Dick Whittington ” and his tremendous
Cat go well throughout, so far as can be judged
amid the storm and stress of an opening night.
When the waits get a little shorter and the Cat
shakes down somewhat into its new surroundings,
the show will probably go still better. It is long,
but not lean ; the staging is reasonably gorgeous ;
and the “ book ” basis of the agony doesn’t too
urgently cry out for the prompt assassination of
the perpetrator thereof.
** * *
The Rickardspantomirneatthe Royal began
its earthly career on the 23rd Dec., and is therefore,
at date of publication, a flourishing infant of a
week old, and doing as well as can be expected.
By getting four days’ clear start of both the Pitt-
street shovvs, it was enabled to peg out as its own
special claim several dear old familiar chestnuts,
which the first-night audience greeted with cheers
—for auld lang syne. This panto., which is billed
as “ Jack the Giant-Killer,” and keeps as near the
title as any reasonable Xmas production is ex-
pected to do, will be remembered, among a host of
others, by the dazzle and glitter of its dresses and
by the most realistic stage-giant on record. Grim
Gobbler is a large and hairy Titan, with the newly-
arrived Story Gofton concealed somewhere in
his works. He is slaughtered by Jack (Addie
Conyers) some time during the evening, but at
11.30 on opening night G.G. was still alive and
full of original sin. The original Jack, by the
way, came to grief with a sprained ankle very
early in the season, and the understudy, Miss Edie
Haytor, butchers the giant pending Miss Conyers’
recovery.
* * • *
Lottie Moore, as Jack’s sweetheart, is as
nice as pie, particularly in the final display where
all the characters come on in their very best
clothes and do a turn at the Court of King Arthur.
That early aboriginal British sovereign, in the
person of A. Bellman, is as heavy as a slab of
cold Xmas pudding, except for two brilliant
flashes ; one where he plays a unique card game
with Merlin and co., and another where he
and George Lauri coruscate in a bur-
lesque of Napoleon and Josephine. The
Huline Brothers, with bells on their fingers
and toes and capes, ring tunes all over them-
selves, and an exquisitely dressed ballet also
jingles like a glorified ice-cream cart. The four
specially - imported dancing girls are graceful
skirt artists with one sensational exit which alone
is worth the admission money. T. Woottwell,
the Haytors, Ivy Scott, and Marietta Nash are
all in the cast and seem to want elbow-room. Alice
Simmons warbles effectively as the Fairy Queen.
Some of the jokes are of the same tonnage as
Governor Phillip’s monument, but, on the whole,
the panto, is a dazzle of loveliness, and it’s a
wonder how the management does it at the price.
The Bulletin has nothing but praise to bestow
on Story Gofton’s Giant; but even if it had, it
would smother its feelings. This paper must
respectfully decline to criticise adversely any
gentleman over Bft. high carrying an ironclad
telegraph-pole as a walking-stick.
** * *
Though the bulk of Rickards’ stars are
away pantomiming at the Royal, that resourceful
manager has enough left to keep the Tivoli pro-
gramme well up to the mark. The eight Kellinos
arrived just in time to fill the gap, and they filled
it to the apparent satisfaction of everybody. The
Royal Standard co., byway of an unusual effort
of originality, staged “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” for
the holiday season, and a few small casual shows
are raging temporarily in various parts of Sydney,
and calling loudly for no particular notice.

The Fitzgerald’s Circus, at Redfern (Syd-
ney), is so far doing good business, and it deserves
all the luck that has come in its way. It is a very
large and honest circus with an immensity of
horse in it, and though the present writer, in his
own private capacity, absolutely loathes horse, he
fully recognises the fact that for a community
which likes the kind of horse that the Fitz-
geralds put on that kind of horse is just the kind
of horse that such a community would like. The
programme is a very long one, and all the items
are good—some of them excellent. All the people
who undertake to turn somersaults over an alarm-
ing quantity «f horse do it neatly and cleverly,
and the equestrians perform some remarkable
feats. John Stewart, who does a surprising
balancing act on a tottery pile of chairs, and
La Belie Rose, the nice-looking female who travels
uphill and down on a revolving globe, are dis-
tinctly above the average, and the performing lion
and elephant are two beasts who deserve ail the
moral support this paper can give them. The
latter animal, when he gets on his tricycle and
Bilmartins at a good pace round the enclosure
with the lion on his back, may be a trifle
laborious, but his conscientious devotion to busi-
ness is most praiseworthy. There are sundry
dazzling girls in the eo., and much spangled cos-
tume, and altogether it is about as much in the
way of a circus as anyone could ask for.

Of two pantomimes that came to pass in
Melbourne, on Monday night, the smaller one at
the Bijou was the less inconvenienced by the heat.
“ Robinson Crusoe ” is a mere extravaganza with
very little meat on its bones, and a very great deal
of bones. Five chief performers, Martin Hagan,
Lucy Fraser, Willie and Amy Gourlay, arid John
Forde supply 90 per cent, of everything worth
mentioning. The balance, which is made up of
scenery, legs, and limelight, deserves a certain
amount of praise, but not nearly so much as these
five industrious and capable grafters. The result is
not much of a pantomime, anyhow. Perhaps it
would have been wiser to bill “ Crusoe ” as a bur-
lesque and leave it to battle fora living on its bare
merits.
** * *
“Dick Whittington,” at the Melbourne
Royal, presented a first appearance of being likely
to settle down into a satisfactory pantomime
before the end of the week. It lasted till mid-
night, and the audience was beginning to melt off
the premises when some of the best items fell due.
Earlier in the proceedings a flower-pot ballet
had given the crowded house at least one
large spectacle to swear by. With a lot of book
material to work upon and a flock of disciplined
infants at command, the stage management should
make “Dick Whittington” go for several weeks.
Unfortunately, Maggie Moore on Monday was
nearly reduced to a standstill by persistent re-
hearsal and a violent attack of weather Her
spiritless performance in the name-part must have
hampered the good intentions of Roberts and
several other people who will steadily improve
their opportunities as time goes on.
** * *
Thus far, business at Melb. Princess’s
suggests that Wilson Barrett is being taken seri-
ously by the female mind. “ Women don’t
reason, they only feel,” and they dearly love to
feel sorry for a majestic hero in flesh-colored
tights. Therefore the doleful unreasonableness of
“Claudian” delights them, as a rule, whilst an
average man, sitting down to consider the cause
and effect of Holy Clement’s Curse (an article in
no way resembling somebody’s patent tonic), gets
oppressed by a sense of unbelief in the things
that harrow his best girl’s heart. Even a
churchwarden couldn’t find a decent excuse for
Clement’s Curse. It is a disgrace to Early Chris-
tianity, and a satire on the name of its holy
utterer. Also penitent Claudian, after 100 years
of devastating public life, is an impossible person,
for he talks to himself about his malign influence
as though it were quite a recent discovery, and
appears to be armed with the current emperor’s
authority to execute any minor potentate on the
spot. The picture of this wandering Pagan living
on and on, and still sticking to his billet under a
succession of Roman emperors whose power was
decaying all the time, is an unconvincing work of
dramatic art. As a highly-colored costume show,
with much blood and thunder and pretentious
dialogue to keep matters moving, “ Claudian ”
may be admired, but as a play, or a sermon, it
lacks the healthy vigor of Truth.
* * * *
The all-round acting of Wilson Barrett’s
company can’t avoid comparison with local
“ talent,” and the comparison is rough upon the
new arrivals—just at first. Presently, no doubt,
they will seem a fairly well-balanced crowd, well-
posted in their solemn duties. There are so many
of them who play dull parts in an experienced
manner that The Bulletin had better maintain
impartial silence concerning everybody save
Wilson Barrett and Miss Jeffries—until one or
other rises above the level of mediocrity. Touch-
ing the two principal performers, last week’s
remarks will keep fresh for another seven days.
** * *
At Melbourne Alexandra the new Dan
Barry season made a boomsome start with “ A
Gilded Sin,” a drama in four large acts and thir-
teen awful situations. “ A Gilded Sin ” contains
a good deal of old Hinglish Christmas in the first
place, after which the girl who was once pure as
the beautiful snow falls among gilded sinners and
destroying angels, and is sorely troubled by visions
of the past until circumstances bring the boss
murderer to bay. Dan Barry’s dramas never fail
to end happily when they get the blood-shedder
at bay. _ By way of a change, The Bulletin
would like to see the curtain drop on a villain who
was doing as well as ever, but the Alexandra
audiences probably wouldn’t roll up if the wages
of sin were beer and skittles, instead of sudden
death. They want Retribution—plenty of it—at
the Alexandra. Manager Dan. 8., as Dennis
O'Toole, covers considerable ground in “A Gilded
Sin,” and 30 other names decorate the programme.
None of them are quite so valuable for decorative
purposes as Lottie La Verne and Doris Ventry.
All the same, Rita Aslin and Tottie Laing read
very nicely.
** * *
Harmston’s Circus, having recovered from
a brief attack of stormy wind, flourishes exceed-
ingly. It is a bright, cheery show, suitable for
parents and guardians as well as the cynical
infants who sit around matinee performances at
half-price. S'mi - lady acrobats are calculated to
bring a warm glow of satisfaction to the baldest
head, inasmuch as they display their strength and
agility in a sentimental light, and smile sweetly
into vacancy—the smile of love’s young dream.
For an aged parent, with a glistening circus on
the top of his head, there is exceptional charm in
a flexible blonde who seems to be thinking of her
sailor lad far across the seas, whereas if she were
to beam upon a beastly Johnnie fellow in the ad-
joining chair, he (the hairless one) would feel his
age keenly. Ballet girls, addicted to smiling at
young Augustus in the stage-box, might make a
business note of this observation. Harmston’s
circus clowns are apt to do something funny once
in a way, although up to now the humorous
supremacy of the baby elephant remains unim-
paired.
The Christmas bill at the Opera House is
a strong muster of attractions, with Austin Rudd,
the Waldrons, and Frank Leon in the middle
distance, and the Hegelmanns to the fore. The
three Hegelmanns, if not actually the “Greatest
Gymnasts on the Face of the Earth,” are some-
thing very like ’em, but The Bulletin must study
the literature of gymnastics before coming to a
further opinion on the magnitude of their per-
formance.
At Poverty Point .
Cockaigne : “As Holy Clement, in ‘Claudian,’ Willard
got his first lift out of the rut of stage villainy, the despair
of every clever actor, from Irving to the Australian
Baker.”
H. : “ Wilson Barrett appears in Melb. without any
essential diminution of power. Time has not thinned his
flowing hair —much. His voice is finely resonant, his
diction manly, with only two slight faults. The first is a
tinge of the London affectation in pronouncing, which is
disliked even in the English provinces, and brings down
the sledge-hammer in America, where, indeed, the
superior classes do talk English. And he is apt to mis-
pronounce ‘ch ’ for the soft ‘ g,’ thus ‘ chem ’ for ‘ gem,’
‘chenius’for‘genius.’ But he takes splendidly—apart
from his piece.”
Shifter: “The books of the Melbourne Theatre Royal
show that the following subjects have been dealt with in
Christmas pantomimes at that house:—‘Aladdin,’
‘Arabian Nights,’ ‘Babes in the Wood,’ ‘Cinderella,’
‘Enchanted Island,’ ‘Forty Thieves,’ ‘Froggie Mould
a-Wooing Go,’ ‘Goody Two Shoes,’ ‘Gulliver,’ ‘Hey
Diddle Diddle,’ ‘House that Jack Built,’ ‘Humpty
Dumpty,’ ‘Jack Horner,’ ‘ Lalla Rookh,’ ‘Magician’s
Daughter,’ ‘ Riquet,’ ‘Robin Hood,’ ‘ Robinson Crusoe,’
‘ Rule of Three.’‘ Sinbad,’ ‘Sleeping Beauty,’ ‘Tom the
Piper’s Son,’ ‘Twinkle Little Star,’ ‘ Valentine and Orson,’
‘ YVhittington.’ ”
Pretty little Ethel Haydon will be leading girl in Man-
chester Princess panto.
Strong man Sandow, the other day, in San Francisco,
had a three-round contest with a 5301 b. lion, which, a
week before, had killed his keeper. In the first round,
Sandow got the beast round the throat with one arm and
round the middle with the other, hugged the wind out of
him pretty well, and then banged him down on the floor.
The second round was a repetition of the first. In the
third, the lion leaped on the man’s back, but, before he
could get his teeth to work, up went Sandow’s arms round
his neck, and he was pitched right over Sandow’s head,
and fell with a resounding thud "on the solid floor. Then
the lion gave in, and put his tail between his legs as a
sign that he had handed in his resignation.
Binoc : “ One part in which poor William Terriss was
never surpassed by anybody was that of Chateau Renaud
in the ‘ Corsican Brothers.’ ”
Holdar M. : “ ‘ Why does the comedian choose Sunday
for his burial-day?’ put in a previous issue, has a wider
application extending to the ‘perfesh.’ generally. The
mummer lives and dies for advt. and, though all his other
yearns gradually fade, this one is always fresh. The re-
mains will annex more ad. if planted on the Sawbath
when his brother pros, can attend in great swarms. And
consider the ‘ extry ’ impression conveyed by the cortfege
as it does a Sunday crawl in sight of the ‘common classes,’
who are more at home on the Day of Rust. Even William
Terriss carefully perished in time for Sunday burial.”
Charles Godfrey, said to be utterly broken down when he
left W.A., is going again as strong as ever at the London
’alls. He gives them “ Dreams,” a clever serio-trashy
song written for him in Australia, of which somebody
wisely remarks that “ only a genuine artist could treat it
with any hope of success.” Godfrey is a genuine artist,
but his art is a minor consideration when one thinks of
his marvellously tough throat.
Writes a London correspondent : —On a recent Friday
Madame Melba gave her final concert in England before
starting for her American tour. Brighton was the locale,
and the diva’s colleagues were Ada Crossley, Ben Davies,
Douglas Powell, and John Kruse. Melba, of course, got
a great ovation, and she looked superb in a wonderful
French frock with an array of magnificent diamonds. The
Gippslander also got plenty of applause, and sang so as
to deserve it. Early next morning Madame Melba started
for America accompanied by her sister, Miss Dora Mit-
chell, her secretary, two maids, a wonderful dog, and a
few tons of luggage.
Dear Bulletin,— l have just come on a waltz, having
for frontispiece a cow with large brand on near side, and
dedicated to the Scottish Australian Investment Co. It
is a grand idea, isn’t it—the Branded Cow Waltz? On the
off-chance that corporate bodies in difficulties pay for
having music dedicated to them, I am at present bringing
out “ The Fixed Deposit Galop,” dedicated to the Queens-
land National Bank.— Harry Monck.
“ Of Nellie Stewart the Chronicle complains that she
‘ too frequently suggests the first boy of pantomime or
burlesque;’ the solemn Standard say's she ‘appeared at
first to lack refinement ’ (our dainty Nellie !); the Globe,
‘ her vocal powers are hardly sufficient to justify the large
share of music assigned her ’; and the Daily Graphic
asserts her ‘singing and voice are not of a very high
class’; whilst the Pall Mall and St. James, in a broad
half-column notice, perform the marvellously malicious
feat of not even mentioning her name ! !! True,” says
The Bulletin’s correspondent, “ the original ‘ I was
dreaming ’ voice is, alas ! not there, and its substitute I
would rather forget, but in verve and vivacity it was the
same favorite Nellie much improved as an actress. Per-
haps she tried to do too much, was over-anxious after her
long rest, orin faceof the unusuallydemonstralive greeting
of a largely Australian audience she may have over-acted
her songs and part, but, whatever it was, at the curtain
most of us were as sad as wet hens when the chicks are
lost."

Old C. H. .Tames, the hairy “father of the
Doom,’ has filed his long-expected schedule in Melbourne.
James s schedule has been anxiously waited for ever since
his bloated child burst a few years back. The main
trouble m his case was the Dominion Banking Co., in
which concern James owned 68,789 out of 70,000 shares.
When the Dominion Co. broke with a fearful odor of
ancient egg, James was requested by the liquidator to
pay £171,399 in calls, but he only smiled in his long beard
and paid no attention whatever. Other boomers went
own by dozens, and paid their lonesome fink or more in
the J, but James made no sign. The court rained orders
on him to file his schedule, and issued a warrant for his
arrest for contempt, but the tough old man simply stayed
over the border out of its jurisdiction. Now that the
i, 11 ”? l ,a,r * ;lr( 'i l has got tired of the joke and sent his
schedule along, there is nothing very surprising in it,
after all. It sets forth that liabilities are £851,000;
assets, £532,000 ; shortage, £319,000. The Commercial
an j* 'ty Melbourne banks and some huge private
creditors seem to have a lien on about everything,
so the Dominion creditors will probably crush old
James for only a color. The old man says indignantly
that one cause of his insolvency was the “ unnecessary ”
calling up of the capital by the liquidator of that bank,
so apparently the last of the boomers reckons that it was
a piece of sheer insolence on the part of the beastly
depositors to want their money and to keep asking what
James had done with it. Still, considering that the bank
kept calling at the top of its voice for some years and sjot
nothing, its action probably was unnecessary—in one
sense. It was quite unprofitable, anyhow.

The National Bank of Tasmania got through
the half-year ended 30th November with a profit of £4127.
Previous half’s profits were £4012, and at 30th November,
1896, they were £3534. The usual 5 per cent, dividend
(£3991) is paid, leaving £136 to the good. There is nothing
special to report, except that the business looks all right,
and the cash-reserve is large and solid, and the National
seems to earn its dividend with a very small margin. The
institution is 12 years old ; it has a paid-up capital of
£152,040 and a reserve of £22,500, which hasn’t had any
additions made to it for a good many years, and it leads a
solid, respectable and blameless existence with apparently
no prospect of doing anything very large for many years
to come.

Of the four purely Sydney banks, the shares of
the B.N.S.W. show a drop in the last 12 months from
£34 7s. 6d. to £34 ss. ; Commercial of Sydney from
£24 17s. 6d. to £22 12s. 6d. ; City of Sydney from £4 ss. to
£3 ; A.J.S. from £1 3s. to 3s. 9d. The restoration of con-
fidence seems further off than ever, somehow.

One utterly foolish and utterly unaccountable
feature in the constitution of the S.A. State Land Bank is
the proviso that all money received byway of repayments
from borrowers must be used in paying off bonds. The
business is constantly getting larger, and the bank is con-
stantly selling bonds to raise the money for more loans,
yet, instead of lending out again the money that comes in
as interest and instalments of principal, it has to use
it for the compulsory repayment of bond-holders, who
don’t want their money back and who only swear when
they have to take it and skirmish round in search of new
investments. The result is that there is a lot of needless
expense and worry, and that the bonds don’t sell so well
as they otherwise would, simply because the public
doesn’t care for a security where it is liable to have its
interest stopped and its principal violently thrown back
at its head at any hour of the day or night.

Tasmania is also thinking of starting a State
Land Bank in a very small way, begining with a capital
of £lOO,OOO. A State Land Bank with only £lOO,OOO
capital would be a microscopic affair even for Tasmania,
but, if the system was once introduced, it could, of course,
be enlarged indefinitely. But the Braddon-Fysh Ministry
totters along with a very small majority now, and no one
believes that it seriously wants the proposed Land Bank,
and it is doubtful if it could carry the measure through
the Assembly in any case, and the House of Slow Land-
lords would throw it out to a dead certainty, so no one is
much interested.

B. D. Morehead, ex-director of the Queensland
National Bank, thus explained why he knew nothing of
the utter rottenness of the institution he was paid to
look after, even when its stench shrieked aloud all
through Australia : “ I did not consider that a director of
a bank or public company would be justified in going
behind a certificate of the accuracy of a balance-sheet,
unless he had grounds for suspecting collusion between
the auditors and officers of the institution ; and in this
case he had not the shadow of a suspicion.” But the
point which Morehead dodges is this : the Q.N. Bank
auditors didn’t for many years past, anyhow, certify to
the accuracy of the balance-sheet, so he had no certificate
of accuracy to go behind. And The Bulletin pointed
this out at intervals for years, and yelled the fact in
Morehead’s large, incapable ear, and he wouldn’t hear it.
Couldn’t Morehead see that the auditors only said every
time that the balance-sheet agreed with the books, and
always avoided saying whether the books were accurate
or not ?

Sydney Telegraph keeps two separate sets of
financial opinions on hand. When the N.S.W. Govt,
floated its 3 per cent, loan in Sydney at £lOO it remarked
proudly that the credit of the Freetrade province was the
best in Australasia. When the Victorian Govt, went one
better by floating its 3 per cent, loan in Melbourne at
£lO3, it considered that Protection must have reduced
Melbourne to an awful state, and made the profitable
employment of money practically impossible when people
would accept such rates as these.

Last year the Northern Territory budget

The Intercolonial Investment, Land and Build-
ing Co. (Sydney) reckons its year’s profit to 31st October,
1897, at £5123. A 10 per cent, dividend (£3295) is paid :
£1650 is added to reserves, making them £10,950, and the
balance at credit of profit and loss is raised to £lB6l. The
Intercolonial always seems to struggle through in good
times and bad, and its 10 per oent. dividend is about as
regular as the sunrise. The fact that it keeps very clear
of the dangerous deposit business, and can’t be seriously
rushed in times of panic by scared people wanting their
money back on the instant, is probably one cause. Another
probable cause is that it doesn’t buy more property than
it can pay for with its own money.

The Mutual Life Assurance Co. of New York
announces that in future it will base its estimates on the
assumption that the rate of interest to be realised on in-
vestments is 3J per cent, instead of 4 per cent., as hereto-
fore. Thismay mean rather smaller bonuses for a year or
two, but it is a wise provision, and implies a lot of addi-
tional security to policy-holders. Several Australasian
offices are also coming down to the 3£ per cent, rate, and
the others ought to do likewise.

The Derwent and Tamar Fire and Marine In-
surance Co. (Hobart) has just finished its 59th year with a
profit on the 12 months’ work of £B4Bl, as compared
with £8175 last year. In view of the bill to be met over
the recent Melbourne fire (where the co. has £14,000 at
stake), the board wisely cuts down the dividend from the
usual 15 per cent, to 74 (£3750). The Derwent and Tamar
is a fine old concern with £50,000 paid up capital, £50,000
reserve, and £19,204 at credit of profit and loss ; and
though its business is very small for its age, it pans out
much better for its shareholders than some concerns
which hustle a great deal harder after premiums. Its
investments in particular, judging by the steadiness of
the interest returns, seem remarkably safe.

Melbourne is still patiently cleaning up the
delris of the almost-forgotten boom. One of the most
hopeless wrecks of the crowd the Freehold Assets
Realisation Co., which is really the old Freehold Invest-
ment and Banking Co., disguised and in liquidation—
reports the results of a year’s work. Properties to the
book-value of £76,982 were sold, and realised £12,422 ;
loss, £64,560. On this basis, it may be inferred that the
£1,063,817 (book-value) of properties, which form the
bulk of the assets, are really worth some £160,000. On
the other hand, the concern paid off £138,455 of its de-
posits during the year, the holders taking £29,105, or about
4s. Id. in the £, in full settlement, and being darned glad
to get it. The Freehold Assets Co. has a peculiar mode of
liquidation : when it sells £60,000 worth (nominal) of pro-
perty for £lO,OOO it spends it in buying back its own deposits
by Dutch auction—the depositor who will take the smallest
sum in the £ getting the preference. Most of them take
about 4s. The depositor who holds on to the last may get
20s. in the £—or he may get one-eighth of a penny; it is
an interesting gamble for the last depositor, and every-
thing depends on whether the assets or the deposits de-
preciate faster. At present, however, the co. owes
£1,135,000 to depositors, and has about .£’1,140,000 of
paper assets to pay them. with. And as the assets are
realising about 3s. 3d. in the £ on their nominal value,
and the depositors are being paid about 4s. in the £, the
natural inference is that unless things improve the last
depositor will be badly left.

Some years ago, when banks were going bung
and many leaves in the book of revelations remained as
yet uncut, a certain Australian paper was in the habit of
submitting advance-proofs of damaging statements to a
certain boomster, and the boomster would promptly sup-
press the threatened article with a little cheque. At last
there came a time when the bleeding financier had no
more character to lose. He was tired of struggling to
keep things dark. A representative of the same old rag
came round with another sheet of damaging statements,
and asked in the same old insinuating voice, “ Will this
look well in our next issue ?’’ The boomster leaned back
in his chair and shrieked, “ Ye s, you blanker, it will look
blanky well,” and the editor’s ambassador slunk away,
muttering that the other fellow was “ evidently dead to
all sense of shame.”

A rare chance to flood foreign philatelists with

penny Victorian stamps in their safes during the late big
Melb. fire. The writer saw a number of these stamps, the

the white portions of the stamps were unchanged in any
way. It is probable that the new printing ink used to
defeat chemical “treatment” contains some ingredient
that changes color on exposure to great heat.

Dear Bulletin,—You were talking the other
day about record weights of pieces of opal, and quoting a
270 z. piece unearthed lately at White Cliffs as an exam-
ple. The winner of that piece has been fortunate enough
to find two larger pieces still, weighing respectively 43
and 330 z. I fancy those are the record. The opal con-
tained in these stones had very fine streaks of color, but
two-thirds of the stones were “ bastard stones” or
“ potch.”—Pom Pom, White Cliffs.

Silver Hill, one of the shows boomed on the

Broken Hill’s mineral output for the year was
valued at £1,755,155, as against £1,751,528 in 1896. The
principal falling-away is in bullion ; here are the figures
for the last four years : ’94, £1,543,038 ; ’95, £959,562 : ’96,
£788,530; ’97, £615,874. And, of course, the decline in
this item has lately been more pronounced than ever. In
the first quarter of 1897 the value of bullion exported was
£174,459 ; by the fourth quarter it had gone down to
£110,900. That fall is, however, more than counterbal-
anced by the increase in the export of crude and concen-
trated sulphide and other ores. In 1895 these materials
were or xport valued at £587,255 ; in 1897 at £1,028,363.

Rumors went round that the B.H. Junction
directors, sick of the mess in the mine resulting from the
creep which the manager reported was a special mark of

punish a manager for carrying that policy into effect.

30 per cent, silver. Long, long ago, the co. paid £50,000
in divs. for similar stuff. The largest piece of silver-ore
found weighed 16cwt.; it was practically pure metal. That
was five years ago ; since then, prospects have, until lately,

Dear Bulletin, — In your “ Wild Cat ” column
of 18th inst. appears a report on the Grong Grong reefs,
in which it is stated that no crushing has been done at
the Harry Smith mine for 12 months. Now, we are crush-
ing at the present time, and have been doing so for some
time, and have just cleaned up 120 oz. for the past four
weeks, and only running the battery half-time at that,
for want of water. As to the statement that £l2OO worth
of gold has been won from the Harry Smith, if that amount
were multiplied by 10, it would be a little nearer the
truth. Furthermore, the above mine never ceases crush-
ing, except when compelled to do so for the want of water,
which, unfortunately for the shareholders, is too often.—
L. Abrahams, Secretary, Harry Smith G.M. Co.
• * * *
Yet another mining disappointment for poor
N.S.W.—Victory, Forest Reefs. For many months the
public has been reading that the stuff would certainly
crush over an ounce to the ton, and calculations as usual
were made on that basis. Result: “ Crushed 50 tons for
350 z. amalgam estimated to contain 17ioz. gold, or 7dwt.
per ton.”
* * * *
The latest N.S.W. mining float in Bull Land :
“ The Great Mount Phoenix Gold-mine,” somewhere in
the Shoalhaven district. Some ore has been treated
going three and four ounces to the ton, and the lode is
said to be from 7to 10ft. thick. Capital, £110,000; pur-
chase price, £90,000 ; £5OOO cash, £25,000 either in cash
or shares, etc ; £60,000 in shares, leaving £20,000 for
working capital. It sounds like some old resurrection.
Anyhow, 10 to 1 there is no mine in that district worthy
of such a capitalisation, and if any attempt were
made to so place it locally it would be ridiculed out of
existence.

An ably-written report on the Wolumla field,
N.S.W., has been furnished by J. E. Came, the geological
surveyor. He finds that while at Pambula, the neighbor-
ing field, the gold is entirely confined to felsites and
rhyolites, at Wolumla it occurs with altered sedimentary
rocks, crushed granite, and felsite. The output from 118
tons of picked first-grade stone from several shows was
6550z5. gold and 1812 oz. silver. Gold average, soz. lOdwt.
12gr. ; silver, 12oz. 17dwt. 14gr. per ton. The seconds
remain for treatment. At the same age Pambula had no
returns equal to these, yet it enjoyed a boom, the death-
like gloom of which extends even to Wolumla !

Premier Forrest, in his budget, announces that
the Perth mint will produce “a thrill of joy” in Wes-
tralia by opening on Ist March next. There is no doubt
now that the mint is needed. The local product of gold
is quite enough to justify the existence of an indigenous
coinery—and as the banks have been charging 2s. 6d. to
3s. 6d. an ounce commission for transhipment, &c., to
Melbourne, the saving will be considerable. But how is
the mint to be managed ? The Deputy-Master, who will
have the responsibility of running the show, was taken
from the Royal Engineers, and figures as Lieutenant John
Francis Campbell. No mention is made of his capabilities
as a coiner, other than that he has spent three months
in the London mint since his appointment to Perth, and
that he is now thoroughly conversant with every process.
One would hardly expect this to be conclusive—unless,
indeed, he is somebody’s cousin or nephew. Moreover,
the London mint does not do the class of work which will
be the chief trouble in Perth. It deals with refined gold
received systematically from the Bank of England. The
Perth mint will have to take any sort of gold the publio
likes to bring, and at the public’s own time. The public
brings its gold in parcels varying from one ounce to
10,000 ounces, and there is only one certainty about it all
—it will never be refined. Cyanide gold will come for-
ward, with heavy admixture of zinc. Certain districts
will send gold with its local alloy of iron—and the
officials will have to struggle with each separate parcel,
refining it independently, and preparing it for the valua-
tion by assay. This is no child’s game ;in fact it is a task
that is quite unknown to the London artificers. Deputy-
Master Campbell has associated with himself two London
mint men, who come to their task blissfully unconscious
of the trouble it involves. Further developments are
awaited with interest.

Even the Plunderderry mine, Coolgardie,
looks like becoming a steady producer. Last crushing,
330 tons for 6070 z. Quite good enough if it can be main-
tained. On the advice of the manager this prodigious
co. recently bought the adjoining lease to the south. The
mine was working within 80ft. of the boundary of that
lease, and the gold chute was dipping that way. This
and the northern block were peggad by the finders of the
“ golden hole.” Both were jumped and forfeited, but
lawyers kept a legal fight until the collapse, and the
political crowd in Perth, whose interests were with the
jumpers, fell in, whereas by compromise the £50,000
which only awaited the completion of the title could
have been lifted. They will know better next time, but
the chances are that none of the crowd will live long
enough to see Bull again make such an ass of himself.

From a reliable mining man at Kalgoorlie:— The
water difficulty will, I am afraid, be serious, although
most people here say there is not the least fear of a
failure in the supply. Seems to me that all the water is
in the oxidised zone of the country, and, as some of the
mines have got into the sulphide zone at 70ft., while
others hare had to go 200 ft. or more, it looks as though
the sulphide zone would be represented by a line in a sec-
tion of the belt in a N.W. and S.E. direction. As such a
supply can only be the accumulation of ages of rainfall, it
must necessarily be limited, and, as the number of stamps
increase, must necessarily diminish. There has been no
rain to speak of this year, nor does it look a bit like it
just now. The Govt, water scheme, even if it is ever
carried out to the letter, cannot be in operation for some
years—probably five—so the chances are that water will
be short in six months’ time, anyhow. As this matter has
a very important bearing on the almost immediate future
of the mines of this great camp, I propose to give it much
closer attention, and at some later date will give you the
conclusions I arrive at. Business is remarkably quiet,
but compared to Coolgardie it is lively. The banks have
put the screw on to a good number, and everybody is
praying for better times with the new year.

Time that .the law in W.A. respecting the rights
of alluvial diggers on gold-leases was either more clearly
defined or set aside altogether. Called upon to define
the extent of his lode, the manager of the Ivanhoe Ven-
ture mine pegged out the whole lease as the boundaries
of the lode ! The Warden then ruled that the onus of
proving that the lode did not extend to the four corners
of the lease rested with the diggers, and he was compelled
to refuse their application to dig within the lease. The
example is sure to be followed by other managers ihe
moment any trouble from diggers is threatened.

I may be, or I may not be. I dunno. Gord

At Melbourne District Court a few days
back one Fanny Cooper charged a man with the
paternity of her unlawful infant. Fanny was
quite positive on the point. She had made the
man’s acquaintance in 1889, she said, and in
January, 1890, a child was born. Whereupon
h anny took out a warrant for her lover’s arrest,
but he disappeared, and for six long years she
sought him vainly. Then she recognised the base
absconder in Melbourne Exhibition Gardens, and
Eut the law upon his track, and finally brought
im to the Court aforesaid, where she was pre-
pared to swear to him among a million betrayers
if necessary. It was a good yarn until the alleged
Lothario put in his defence. He proved that from
November, 1888, until April, 1891, he had led a
life of strictest celibacy in Darlinghurst Gaol. And
the only alibi that is better than being in gaol is
the alibi of being dead.

Melbourne has got a lady burglar whose
experiences seem to show that the woman house-
breaker has some advantages over the male one.
A Richmond citizen found her ransacking his
house at midnight, and sprinted down the street
after her, the lady, who was barefooted, making
remarkably good time round the corner. When
he caught her, and tore most of her dress oti in
the process, she fell on the pavement under a gas-
lamp, and wept bitterly at his feet, and told him
that she had three starving children at home.
The householder was in a partially clothed state,
having rushed out in great haste, and that made
him feel embarrassed. Moreover, the burglar was
young and rather good-looking, and as she lay on
the pavement in the abandon of grief, showing her
bare feet and a lot of white ankle, she made
the situation all the more difficult. Moreover,
the man was painfully aware that he had torn a
great deal of her frock off in capturing her, and
that it wasn’t gentlemanly to thus violently un-
dress a lady in the street. Just at this crisis some
other men came along, and it being a man’s
natural instinct to take the part of a young woman
with bare feet they interceded for her, and the
only thing that citizen could do was to wipe away
a tear, and tell her to go home and be a good girl
and an ornament to society for the future. A male
Bill Sikes would never have got out of a scrape in
that fashion. Then the penitent girl went away
and apparently committed seven or eight more
burglaries, till she wore out public sympathy and
was arrested with <£ls worth of stolen under-
clothing in her possession.

Dear Bulletin, —“ Arrived front Sydney ”
seems likely to become a recognised offence under
the unwritten law of M.L. One instance out of
many : Two boys were charged before a Welling-
ton magistrate with having robbed a swagger’s

like to send two boys to gaol, but I think 21 days
will do you no harm and be a lesson to you. 9>
When up rose the strong blue arm of the law:

One B. Douglas propounds in the columns
of the Age an unexpected conundrum—“ Why is
Victoria retrograding ? ” Douglas gives, at con-
siderable length, the brief answer—George Tur-
ner and co.” ‘ How,” he asks, “ can we possibly
improve our condition under the present do-noth-
ing policy of the Government ? What we want to
resuscitate our deplorable condition is a bold and
Liberal policy, such as would set the wheels of in-
dustry in motion ... a practical and progres-
sive Government . . . one that will raise the re-
quired means for the development, &c., &c. By
this means we may soon restore prosperity, and
make this grand country blossom as of yore.”
A Melb. lawyer, prominent in criminal
practice, has decided to shut down for ever on
Hindoo cases. He avers that he wouldn’t believe
any Indian whatever on his oath or on anything
else. Prior to a recent case in which one of these
“ British subjects like ourselves ” was implicated,
the client rounded up a dozen of his “ cousins ”
to the lawyer’s office. “What did you bring all
these men here for?” demanded the man of
parchment. “All right,” said the son of the
Himalayas, with a sweep of his hand; “ me pay
you ; you tell him what to swear.” The lawyer
decided to let some other rising member of his
profession have the job, and fired the procession
of yellow scum down the steps. “ I’m not over
particular,” he says, “but those fellows are a bit
too strong.” It would really be worth while to
keep a record of Hindoo evidence in Austra-
lian courts. Kipling relates that nobody pays
the slightest attention to native evidence in
India, where you can get a murder charge (corpse
included) trumped up against an enemy for 10
rupees.
One hot evening

stout business man
took off his hat
and proceeded
to wring his
head. The

ed off

when

Here the

spirit of
young Aus-
tralia came
to the sur-
face. One
person in a
straw hat bet
sixpence with
another that an
odd number of
drops would fly
off next time the
head was shaken.
The stout man shook
four drops off, and
the sixpence was lost.
Then he gave his smok-
ing cranium another shake
—result, five drops. After that
he shook off an even number of
drops eight times in succession,
and the first gambler got through all his change
and retired from the game. The moisture gave
out about that time, so it wasn’t renewed.

Sundry S.A. brewers offered to come
down handsomely with beer on Xmas day so as
to gladden the hearts of the poor old derelicts
and incurables in the benevolent asylums with one
last look upon the foaming pewter. Whereupon
the Christian Endeavor Union requested Kingston
to prohibit the distribution, and keep the aged on
weak tea and cold water at the festive season. It
is gratifying to note that the S.A. Premier re-
fused, and the pity is that he didn’t refuse with
anything like the violent language that the case
called for. As the ancients in the asylums can’t
get out to go on the bust even if they do contract
a love of drink at the age of 80 through having
one beer at Xmas, and as they have no money
to bust with if they do get out, and as
there will be no more gratis beer for 12 months,
the Christian Endeavor Union looks a pretty mean
crowd of bigots, anyhow. What does it matter
if the toothless patriarch does get a chance to fix
his bleared eye on just one beer before lie dies ?
The Union would supply him instead with cold
water and exhortation ; but water is thin and ex-
hortation is very flatulent, and when a man is aged
75 and gone in the legs he prefers creature com-
forts that warm his innards for the moment to all
the spiritual comfort that ever grew in Palestine.
And probably, if the choice was left to' him, he
wouldn’t give up his shaky hold on that lonesome
pot of consolation to save the souls of all the
Christian Endeavorers in S.A.

Divorce and advertisement. From a recent

Did you suggest to Richards that he should take some

Witness : I may have. I think he was taking it at the
time. I think that is in answer to a telegram from him
saying he could not come up that night. (Laughter.)

Witness : Yes.
Do you find it good for you ?
Witness ; it is fine and fattening. (Laughter.)
On the endurance of Government Depart-
ments. Years ago, in the principal Baratarian
Post-office, an imported youth was appointed,
through political influence, to a position carrying
■£2oo per annum. There was no work for him to
do, and the postmaster set him to copy the printed
slips (on which were the names of the’recipients of
registered letters) into a book. This duty was
altogether too arduous, and the gilded youth, con-
trary to instructions, began to cut off the printed
slips and paste them in. The postmaster remons-
trated, was defied, had to report the matter to
headquarters, and was politely informed : “The
Department had no objection to the pasting pro-
cess.” And, for all that is known to the contrary,
that youth, now grown-up, is pasting in slips to
this day.

THE CURE FOR DEPRESSION.
When would-be toilers groan aloud
For work or occupation,
And leaders of the land-boom crowd
Are lying low behind a cloud
Avoiding observation ;
When rains are spoiling farmers’ crops,
And small suburban drapers’ shops
Can’t take enough to pay the rent,
And stock, instead of rising, drops—
Then is the time for giving “ slops”
To Turner and the Government.
As rulers of a trustful State,
And pillars of the nation,
Their duty is to legislate
A means of raising profits great
From general stagnation ;
To “ put their shoulders to the wheel,”
And turn up trumps at every deal,
And borrow’ cash at four per cent.
Wherewith to feed the public purse ;
Or else the “country ” breathes a curse
On Turner and the Government.
The life-blood of enduring trade
Is boomsome legislation,
The “ country ” needs the earnest aid
Of Gillies. Why thus long delayed
Victoria’s salvation ?
His policy would soon restore
Lost confidence for evermore,
And banish gloomy discontent.
Rise, Duncan, rise ! the gods command ;
Thine be the task to rid the land
Of Turner and the Government.

In my youth the pure Ideal
Shone as proudly o’er the Real
As the silvery torch of Dian o’er a petty candle ray ;
But as years dispelled Illusion,
Fell my gods in dire confusion,
And I wept—to think my Idol’s feet were only feet of clay :
And as time goes on the Real
Grips the throat of things Ideal
With the grip of wolves that fasten on the flank of fleeting

And as Days advance I falter
In my search for fane and altar,
And would gladly find an Idol —that had only feet of clay.

Here is an interesting English mystery
which is somewhat relevant to a cursory discussion
that once flitted through The Bulletin columns.
A man lately disappeared from a large London
hotel. When last seen he was entering his bed-
room. This room was found exactly as a man
would leave it on turning into bed. All his
clothes were there, and it was evident that if he
had gone off, as he undoubtedly had, he had de-
parted in his pyjamas and a dressing-gown, and
bootless, hatless, and penniless. A search was
made, of course, but not the faintest clue came to
light. The river was dragged, the detectives
poked about, and interest flickered and went out.
I hen, seven weeks after the man’s disappearance,
his body was found by an eccentric foreign visitor.
It was shockingly decomposed, and lay under an
accummulation of cobwebs in the hotel bath.
The Revue Medicale (Paris) states that
An English ladies’ tailor advertises that he is the
sole possessor of a fabric which resists the passage
of the Rontgen rays, so that ladies’ charms can-
not be disclosed to the curious without their
consent.

There are many quaint ways of dying in
Australia ; the backblocks are full of unconsidered
side-tracks leading to destruction. But a bush-
man who lately pegged-out near Chiltern (Vic.)
met with an end which was even above the Aus-
tralian bush average for shuddersomeness, and,
from a shuddery point of view, the bush —with its
stories of death from thirst, and of timber-getters
slowly burnt to death or gradually crow-eaten
while held down alive by fallen trees- -is a place
where the nice fresh horror is always waiting on
the half-shell, so to speak. This particular bush-
man took a fit in a paddock beside the Murray.
Then the ants ate him for 24 hours, at the end of
which time he was discovered still alive, but
dying. For plain, homely gruesomeness that
episode would be hard to beat.
The lesson
of every big di-
vorce case is the
same —if you
are going into
the co-respond-
ent business, al-
ways typewrite
your letters.
Also type-write
the signature
and the ad-
dress. A type-
written letter is
too vague and
unproveable to
be sworn to in
a way that will
satisfy a jury.
The man who
pours forth his
soul on a type-
writer can pour
with impunity,
provided he
keeps that ma-
chine for writ-
ing to that girl
only, and per-
sonally smashes
it into small
junksand drops
the wreckage
into the sea
when the di-
vorce case be-
gins. Type-
writers have
sometimes
identifiable pe-
culiarities —
hence the need for this precaution.

then threatened to wreck the lockup, if their
mates were not freed, but four policemen charged
down on them and dispersed the lot ! The British

A quaint Bulle-
tin correspondent
(alas, most Bulletin
correspondents “run”
to Drink) :
I have been taking too
much whisky. I was con-
scious of intense malaise
if I could not get it. I
drink only between 8 and
10 p.m.—but was shocked
at last to find it took J of
a bottle to satisfy me.
What to do ? By a mere
accident I took to elder-
berry wine of very low
alcoholic strength. It is
very nasty. I find that a
J-bottle will replace the
whisky and I suffer hardly
any malaise. This is curi-
ous. To experiment fur-
ther, I tried about J-lb of
plum jam in 1| pints of
boiling water. Same re-
sult! It seems, then, that,
in some cases, where there
is strong- desire to reform,
the craving may not really
be for alcohol, but merely
for sugar and water. Or,
any readily diffusible and
assimilable tonic, food, or
stimulant. This is worth
noting. By the way, a
thing I like very much is
kola comp, elixir. It con-
tains celery seed, cocoa,
kola ; 10s. a bottle here in
the wilds of Maoriland.
It does not create a habit with me, but gives me great
joy. It makes me feel light and peckish and charitable.
You can mix it with alcohol, hot water, lime-juice, tea,
sugar, and Van Houten’s cocoa, all together, and you
won’t want to call the Queen your aunt. Iced, with
cocoa and lemon-squash, it would be grand. Or treat it
like vermouth gommee. Mix with sugar, acid, and strong
gum, scrape a lot of ice in, and suck through a straw. A
very nice hot drink is sugar, lime-juice, V.H. cocoa—
boiling water. Lemon-and-melon jam in boiling tea is
also good.
ARTLESS.

About the most agreeable row any Bulle-
tin man ever saw took place on Boxing Day in a
Sydney banana shop. The Roman proprietor had
sold to a stout Sussex-street matron a bag of
bananas with the bad ones at the bottom as usual,
and she was just bringing them back as this scribe
went by. She commenced the campaign by land-
ing Marc Antony in the eye with the oldest fruit
in the bag. While he was trying to get the
banana out of his eye the lady filled the place
with abusive expressions, and pounded the stock
generally with an umbrella, and before the Roman
could see and had finished a few observations on
his own account she had burst almost everything
except one unripe melon, which refused to give
way to her assaults. Then an Italian reinforce-
ment seized her from behind, but she knocked it
out in one round, put her foot into a tray of
tomatoes, wrecked the fly-catcher, aimed the
melon into the back-room at the Italian’s wife,
who was having hysterics all by herself, missed
her but broke some crockery, which rebounded on
to the cat, and then tramped over the ruins into
the street, where the loafers at the adjacent pub.
cheered wildly as she departed.

Adelaide Hansard, in reporting a recent
speech by Premier Kingston, made him say that

things, which reflects infinite credit on the pro-
vince.” By-and-bye this beautiful misprint will
get to England, and the hair on the head of the
Nonconformist conscience will stand up in horror.

Melbourne City Council was discussing the
question of street-watering the other day, when
Alderman Carter, M.L.A., whisky-merchant, and
high-priest in the temple of Respectability, put in
a word for sprinkling the city streets on the
blessed “Sawbuth.” Said Carter: “The Council
can get plenty of infidels to water the streets on
Sunday, and so obviate the necessity of well-
dressed gentlemen and ladies who have consciences
being compelled to attend their places of worship
in a very undesirable frame of mind.” Observe :
The man who waters the streets on Sunday is
necessarily an mfidel ; an infidel has no con-
science ; he would be lost anyhow ; why not put
him on to sprinkle the well-dressed gentleman’s
way to church, in order that the well-dressed gent
may arrive at the tabernacle in a desirable frame
of mind, and not mad with Providence because
there is grit in his eye, and his Paris hat looks as
if it had been dragged through a dust-storm by a
horrid dog ? The unconscionable infidel has his
uses—his duty is to enable Pat Man to go to
church in comfort.

One Sarah Ann Somebody, who recently
sued for a divorce in Melb. and failed to get it, is
another victim of the unaccountableness of the
law. Sarah Ann Somebody and her husband had
their home and domicile in the backblocks of
Queensland. The evidence alleged that the
reason why she didn’t sue for a divorce in Queens-
land was that her husband threatened to “do
for her” if he ever found her in that province
again ; also, he gave her 20s. and threw her off a
steamer (then in Hobson’s Bay) on to Victorian
soil. This was eight years ago, and the lady had
lived in Victoria ever since, nevertheless judge
Hodges decided that Sarah Arm Somebody hadn’t
an “independent domicile”in Victoria,and hadn’t
been “ domiciled in Victoria at the time of the
desertion,” so her petition was refused. Yet, if
Sarah Ann Somebody, who purported to be fired
out of a steamer in Victorian waters, with 20s. in
her pocket, and warned off at the risk of fatal
personal stoush, wasn’t deserted in Victoria, where
was she deserted ? She must have been deserted
somewhere.

tion was provided was “ a disgrace to civilisation.”

What is left of that ancient Melb. hostelry,
the Albion, Bourke-street —a pub. redolent of
memories of the golden coaching days—was
before the Licensing Court the other day, charged
with not having sufficient entrances, i.e. , one to
the premises and another to the bar direct. The
old Albion was pulled down a year or more ago,
and the name now stands only for an underground
bar and feeding-room to which there is but one
front door. The Albion pleaded that a back-door
from Little Bourke-street fulfilled the conditions
of the Act, and the residuum of the ancient ren-
dezvous was discharged without a stain on its
counter.

Tozer wanted, the other day, to appoint a
protector of half-castes—half-caste girls in particu-
lar. . . . Western, M.L.A., remarked that he
knew one half-caste in the West who owned 1000
head of cattle ; two others, who were drovers,
employed white men and possessed hank accounts.
A protector for these men would certainly be an
anomaly. . . . The treatment of aboriginals in
the beche-de-mer trade is a matter that calls for
speedy remedy. It is no uncommon thing for
men to be taken to the islands by beche-de-mer
fishers, and left there to starve or to drown by
way of settling the wages question.
According to the statement of the prose-
cutrix in the Suffield case, she first saw her
assaulter sitting on a gate, smoking. She recog-
nised him. He bade her good evening. Being
frightened, she did not reply, but ran quickly
past him. Yet it appears that all she had
ever heard of Suffield was of his kindly and
inoffensive disposition. His gentleness towards
children had been specially instanced to her. She
herself appears to have been anything but un-
willing to listen to the relation of these traits of
Suffield’s character. Yet the mere fact of meet-
ing him, sitting at ten o’clock of a summer’s night,
upon a gate, smoking, within hail of her em-
ployer and his family—the mere sound of this
gentle and inoffensive man’s voice—so frightened
her that she rushed, panic-stricken, away from
him !

Not five feet eight.
She doted on a figure slim :
Without a doubt
I could not satisfy that whim—
For I am stout.
And, knowing this, how could I dare
(A boor like me)
To ask that maid her life to share—
My wife to be ?
And yet I did ! egregious ass,
I must confess ;
I popped the question—and, alas 1
She answered “ Yes ! ”

You did what men were loth to do ;
Alas ! that mankind is so fickle.
Through wrath and wrack the line you drew,
And did what we were loth to do.
Oh, shame ! that they should martyr you,

God made the world. But all who see the light
Have to create again this universe,
And color it, apportion day and night,
Make it a paradise, or else a curse.
And so I shaped it with the tools I had,
And 10, I looked at it—and it was bad !
It happened, as it mostly does to men,
That I began to rave and rhyme and flirt;
To cut it short : I fell in love, and then
I thought a reconstruction would not hurt.
I shaped the world anew in Love’s sweet mood,
And 10, I looked at it—and it was good !

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, December 28, 1897.
Mr Dear Mtee —
Desolation will flap its sable wings for about a
month longer at Govt.-House, and then the ’appy
’ome will be filled again. His Ex. and party will
turn their faces Sydney-wards on the 20th January,
and Her Ex. has booked her passage to this be-
nighted country by P. and O. of the near future.
A brother of Gov. Hampden, by name Thomas
Brand, has arrived here and been convoyed to the
vice-regal summer retreat by Aide. Sloane-Stanley.
Capt. and Mrs. Ferguson will flit to London for
the season, and Mrs. F. will shake the creases out
of her wedding-dress and give it an airing before
H.M. at a drawing-room. Brides of the “ hupper
suckles ” are always expected to toe the line at
Buckingham Palace within a reasonable time after
their marriage.
Boxing Day meeting at Randwick brought out
a fair collection of notables, local and interpro-
vincial. As the day was cool, highly - polished
toppers and long coats were worn by all the poli-
ticians, who all looked their sprucest. The veteran
Reggie Bright trotted wearily about with a “ has-
been ” air ; Emily Soldene was a sketch in black-
and-white. On the well-filled stand were many
bumt-up holiday-makers from up North, and some
new and startling styles, which mostly adorned
the backs and heads of visitors from the country
and other provinces. The drunk-and-disorderly
hat was a feature of the millinery; with a bashed-
in crown, and slapped on to the wearer’s left ear,
it lends a riotous appearance which would justify
any magistrate in giving the wearer 14 days’ with-
out the option at sight. A pink girl had a bright-
rose straw tile thus defying the laws of gravity by
standing on its brim on her shoulder; and another,
a golden hat which crowned a yellow-and-white
poem, was hanging on its owner’s left ear.
To be up-to-date now, every woman uses
one ear as a hat-peg. Three gaudy girls in bilious
orange, blue and brick-pink, respectively, obvi-
ously wore their finery at the society-paragra-
phistes. Little Mrs. Savage tripped prettily in
pale blue. Miss Church had a neat, pink frock
and a highly successful hat. A lady with an
arsenic green ruff looked as if she had trimmed
her throat with curly cabbage.
As a display of gilty splendor and gorgeous
gowning the Royal Panto., “Jack the Giant Kil-
ler,’’takes high rank among seasonable infestivities.
The purple and fine linen is not merely confined,
as it often is in Pantos., to the jokes of the come-
dian and the petticoats of the ballet; but it
is lavished broad-cast on every performer down
to the minutest “ super ” whose small body
is encased in glossy satin and the most lustrous of
silken tights. In the midst of so much sartorial
splendor, even Lauri, as the inevitable burlesque
female, hadn’t the heart to forego a chance of
sporting a swell ng-out, and looked a positively
pretty woman in powdered hair and a multi-colored
Watteau gown. The four new ballet-maidens
settled down into the affections of the male portion
of the audience with a loud clank—especially
the dark - eyed houri who distributed smiles
and winks round the house with devastating
effect. The first three dances of this fascinating
quartet, though performed in garments of much
loveliness, were eclipsed by the delirious whirl in
the Court scene, where the beauties, gowned in
indescribable masses of pink brocade, scarlet satin,
white lace poppies and ribbons, finished up their
can-can by being borne aloft, shoulder-high, each
with" a fascinating black satin shoe pointing to the
gas-jet. Lottie Moore, more winsome than ever,
but wearing a frock of uncompromising blueness,
which clashed with its surroundings every time,
made Pansy quite an intelligent panto, girl. In the
final scene she comes on inside an eye-dazzler of a
brocade frock with pale-blue trimmings, and spoils
the effect thereof by exhibiting doubtfully white
hosen which suggest the harrowing thought that
Lottie’s washing hadn’t come home in time. Tom
Woottwell’s indigo circus-tent pants looked well
when he entered on his patent motor-car, pro-
pelled by a little portable fireworks-factory con-
cealed in a kerosene-tin. A wild craving of the
audience for encores gave opportunity to a robust,
red girl to tack on several additional verses to a
song which was dreary and wholly unintelligible.
The only words of it which were understandable to
an English-speaking audience w ere “Themayden
was so sorsee,” and they didn't seem worth re-
iteration.
Contradictory reports are given about this year’s
Xmas trade. Some leading firms declare they
have had better biz. this year than they have since
the great gone-bung time ; other traders depres-
singly state that money is tight. In that case,
money must be like every second man in the
streets towards the wee sma’ ’oors on Xmas Eve.
To the theatre-goers leaving the Royal near mid-
night, where “Jack the Giant-Killer” was still
going strong, the prowlers looked very staggery.
A roaring trade is doing in gloves ; they are the
“ toney ” present at this festive season. One
lady, whose name wold bullocks would not tear
from me, was taken into a glove-shop by a man
friend, who asked her advice about getting some
pairs as a present for a lady. The sagacious
woman thought she knew whom the gloves were
for, and chose assorted colors in three-and-nine-
penny misfits, inwardly rejoicing at the thought
of the other woman's disgust at the badly-chosen
gift. The donor meekly suggested a higher price,
ut his adviser assured him he was doing the right
thing at 3s. 9d., so he bought four pairs and handed
them to her with a polite bow as his little Xmas
tribute. And the glove-expert had to look full of
wild rapture, and to accept, with a twisted smile,
her cheap kids.
For want of style and dowdy frumpishness the
first-night d.c. of “ The Babes in the Wood ” was
below low-water mark. Every woman flopped
and fanned herself, and her hair came out of curl,
and few men were in regulation rig, while the
gowns were all above high-water mark and a low-
cut bodice the exception. One frock, strapped up
over the shoulders with beady bands, was smart,
and a black-and-white dress in the front row
looked fashionable. Ada Reeve, like a green-and-
gold lizard in tights, annexed many flower
bunches and one ingenious device of a vegetable
bow and arrow. Alice Leamar’s wedding-dress
is looped about with pearly chains, and dainty
cupids hold up her white train, pink as an em-
bodied bridal blush. The glitter of the wedding-
ballet culminates in the lobster-salad girls with
silver bowls for hats and lettuce garlands on their
skirts, and in the walking Neapolitan ices in
correct stripes. Robin Hood’s merry men are
bandbox foresters, correctly clad in cloth by
an accurate costume designer. The make-up
of the two desperadoes, Coleman and Burke,
is a feature of the show. In their heavy-
villain boots, drooping wool-feathers and gaudy
cloaks, they prowl about melodramatically and
carry in their belts a whole marine-store of rusty
ironmongery. On the proceeds of their crime
they emerge as cheap swells at a seaside resort,
where Burke is annexed by a large rope to the
largest hat on record.
A cruel disappointment befell an up-country
township recently through the non-arrival of any
dignitaries to bless the local flower-show. Capt.
Ferguson, the nearest approach to vice-royalty ob-
tainable, was expected, as he was visiting those
parts, to throw a Govt. House halo around the
blossoms. To meet the train he was supposed to
arrive by, a squadron of the district soldiery was
drawn up, and an officer pranced up and down
before the regiment in martial style. But the
looked-for visitor didn’t arrive as per agreement,
and the Mayor had to be hastily turned on to
open the show before the exhibits wilted away,
which was a very flat proceeding. And the dis-
gusted soldiery drowned their grief in beer.
It is “the thing ” among the Women’s College
students to wear sun - bonnets in the college-
grounds. The flopping head-gear is more com-
fortable than the hard, unyielding trencher, and
surrounding an innocent baby-face with fluffy
hair it looks fetching; but the soft muslin frills
standing off from a bald, knobby forehead and
glistening specs, give the wearer the appearance
of a she-wolf in lamb’s clothing. By the way, a
back view of a girl-undergraduate in a roomy
gown, topped off with a flapping cotton bonnet,
doesn’t suggest much grace of outline.
Nicholson and co. issue their Xmas musical
magazine with a bold challenge to the whole
world to show any other shilling publication of
similar quality. Twenty-six new and popular
ballads for a shilling come to less than a half-
penny per ballad, which certainly is cheap. The
principle soul-cries of the production are a
specially-composed song “This is Love,” by A.
Plumpton, Florence Schmidt’s favorite encore
warble, “ The Day when You’ll Forget Me,” and
a tuneful “Japanese Lullaby” sung by Fannie
Liddiard, at the Lyceum Theatre. Besides these
there are a good number of sad comics and some
good standard songs, the whole enclosed in a gay
and artistic cover showing a draping of national
bunting over a glimpse of the ’Arbor. This
locally-produced music-book has no “ Made in
Germany ” about it; it is all got up right here on
the spot.
Divorce is a queer stepping-stone by which to
clamber up among the enthroned gods on society’s
gilded seats, but some ambitious women are using
their rumored domestic cataclysms in that way.
A handsome woman, whose name has been in
everybody’s mouth lately as a future figurer before
Justice Simpson, took the opportunity recently to
go forth in public with her hubby and intro-
duce him to an acquaintance, observing ironically,
“ I suppose you’ve heard that my husband is
going to divorce me, and that Mr. So-and-So and
Mr. Such-and-Such are to be made co-respon-
dents ? ” The acquaintance hadn’t heard of it till
then, and was properly sympathetic at the
unfounded rumor, and also at the social status of
the alleged co-respondents—all thoroughly Naice
men. “The Blanks are not going into the
Divorce-court,” “ Mr. So-and-So is not a co-
respondent,” is as good an advt. as putting it the
other way round.
Many an unwritten romance could be disin-
terred from the old-clothes shops. The chief
dealers have their regular connection, and at the
season’s end triumphs of toggery are disposed
of cheap by leaders of fashion to the reach-me-
down vendors. It is an understood thing that the
garments must be altered so that their identity is
destroyed. And, as a rule, the Sydney smart
woman’s clotheß become old friends to her friends
before she discards them, and are easily recognis-
able. A lady had an imported skirt when the
black skirt and colored blouse boom was raging,
like unto whioh there was no other robe in the
city ; she wore it until its decadence, and even
beyond, and then sold it. And. one day a spiteful
cat, paying an afternoon visit, gave her »'vay
before a whole roomful of callers by saying : yh>
my dear, I’ve just seen your black skirt walking
down the street with a cream blouse, and it looks
as good as new.”
The stamp-collecting craze is not so crazy as
some people imagine. Postage-stamps are quite a
modern idea, even now, and hundreds of ‘ first
•issues,” still obtainable for a few pence, or shil-
lings, are likely to become valuable relics before
the youth of to-day becomes bald and toothless.
This is the golden age of philately. The rarity of
early Australian stamps, for instance, is bound to
keep pace with the advance in population and
education and consequent increase, in letter-writ-
ing, apart from the gradual disappearance of
present collections through accidental destruction.
Australian stamps, on a rough reckoning, were
about forty times more scarce at the outset than
English issues. In all countries the tendency is
for stamps to grow commoner, and, therefore, less
worth collecting as time goes along, until, at last
the philatelic demand will be for “ first century ’
issues only. This is the first century. Most of
the stamps we give away to acquisitive small boys
are destined to crumble into oblivion under a glass
case.
Lydies aren’t popular lodgers with landladies
anywhere. ’ Even in the sparsely-womaned West,
girls travelling “ on their own ” get the cold shoul-
der from hostesses. Two girls from this side, who
lately went to Perth to find work at the inevitable
typewriter, on landing, wearily trudged about
from house to house, only to be met with the curt
refusal, “We don’t take lydies.” The kind of
woman who gets on in those parts is the one who
is never without an escort. But civilisation is
spreading, and so a mine-manager found when he
arrived at a Westrahan town, bringing with him
a lady whom, to appease the proprieties, he called
his “sister.” But (I am told the “sister” was
fascinating) the shift-boss, the engineer, and one
or two others promptly proposed to her, so the
manager (who evidently was a Bible student, and
knew the game had been played before) put a full
stop—or, at all events, a semi-colon —to all such
philandering by marrying the lady himself.
Some of the ’buses with the new stair attach-
ment have been entirely deserted on top lately,
women preferring to crowd inside on sunny days
to sitting aloft on the shiny oilcloth. A ’bus-boy
explained the reason to a curious “ inside ” on a
day of lofty temperature : “ Carn’t sit outside —
jist feel them cushions.’
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Married lady-doetors, apparently, follow the
example of married stage-ladies in being profes-
sionally known as ‘Miss.’ The ex-Melbourne
Hospital surgeoness, though now Mrs. Buchanan,
practises as ‘Dr. Ereda Gamble,’ and has a huge
brass-plate so inscribed on her Collins-street front-
gate. Similarly, Melbourne’s best-known woman-
medico, Dr. Constance Stone, is, privately, plain
Mrs. Jones.
“ Mt. Morganaire D’Arcy, now of Stanmore
Hall, Middlesex, has just lost his wife. News of
Mrs. D’Arcy’s death reached Australia on Christ-
mas Eve. She was a dark, handsome lady, for-
merly Miss Birkbeck, of Rockhampton. Some of
her picturesque clan still bask in Bananaland
sunshine, only pausing in their enjoyment of life
when some tactless outsider describes them as
‘Mexicans’ instead of ‘South American Spanish.’
“ Somehow, Mrs. D’Arcy seldom appeared in
public, and with increasing riches and importance
she grew more and more retiring. To the last,
however, she was well worth looking at, and she
understood, moreover, the secret of setting-off to
the best advantage her raven hair, stately figure,
and clear-cut features. Old Rockhamptonites still
admiringly chronicle remembered glimpses of her
as a young wife, garbed effectively in colors—
daring for those times—as she drove about the
township in her husband’s one-horse buggy.
“ One of the recitations at a recent Speech-day
was a translation of Hugo’s ‘Fishers.’ The
nervous young girl-elocutionist nearly got caned
by her flustered teacher afterwards for rendering
‘ the ominous old ocean sobs without ’ as ‘ the
amorous old ocean,’ etc.
“But, really and truly, love seems to come
almost as naturally on the ocean-wave as sea-sick-
ness. A fond girl travelled all the way from Eng-
land in the steerage, just the other day, to marry
her true love in Australia. The faithful one had
hardly stepped aboard to welcome his bride-elect
when she asked, in a snip-snap tone : ‘ Can you
marry me, and give me a home, within half-an-
hour ? If not, here’s a chap as will ! ’ turning to
a fellow-passenger standing sheepishly at her
side. The sight of a rival in the field speedily
heated up Number One’s affections, which, perhaps,
had grown a bit lukewarm, and he talked so
eloquently of a double-frontage villa and a lady-
help, that he haled his matrimonial consignment
and her worldly goods ashore without further
bother.
“ A neat thing in semi-official Xmas cards was
issued ‘with the best wishes of the Mayor of
Melbourne and Mrs. M'Eaoharn.’ The four sides
of this festive souvenir present views of the Town
Hall, Prince’s Bridge, Queen’s Wharf, and other
places as they were in 1857 and are to-day ; also, a
picture of Melbourne’s first wild, untutored
settlement (1837) on the bushy Yarra bank
where the modern wharf-lumper now earns
colonial beer by the Sweat of his brow.
Eawkner and Batman, the early fathers of Mar-
vellous M., are suggested by two very small figures
crossing the Yarra—which is believed to have been
quite suitable for bathing, at that period—in a
small boat. Presumably, they have just corn-
pleted the purchase of the future Victorian capital
for a few yellow glass beads and a bottle of rum.
A black dot on the opposite bank of the river may
be taken to depict the royal aboriginal vendor of
the property engaged in emptying the bottle.
“Aprons and embonpoint go abominably to-
gether. At a tony charity function of modern
times, more than one beefy dowager blotted an
otherwise agreeable landscape through adopting a
‘pinny.’ It’s like going to a ball with palpable
powder on your nose, as if to accentuate your mis-
fortune in burning the offending feature beet-red
at tennis that afternoon. .
“About a year back, the bride of a recent
fashionable wedding had pointed out to her the
girl whom a,n acquaintance was about to make his
wife. Gazing in true feminine fashion at the
other, she turned to her friend. ‘What special
qualifications has she to be Asterisk Dash’s girl ? ’
she demanded, with a snort. The question, in
time, returned to the principals, and the other day,
when her own much-advertised wedding took
place, one of the first telegrams to arrive was from
Mrs. Dash, ‘ What special qualifications have you
to be Blank Thingumbob’s wife ? ’
“ It is related that during Labor-member John
Hancock’s last election for Footscray, two fine
carriages with spanking horses drove up to his
committee-rooms. The drivers asked for placards,
and labelled their vehicles ‘Yote for Hancock.’
The members of Hancock’s committee were
puzzled about these carriages; they couldn’t
understand where they came from. But they
were employed all the day in Hancock’s service.
It now transpires that they were sent up by
squatter Pursey Chirnside from Werribee. One
of the few commendable features in Pursey’s
political character is his liking for Hancock.
“Brassey, Madden, and M‘lntyre sat together
at the Melbourne Conservatoire of Music concert,
and pretended not to be bored. These three wise
men apparently know little about music. One of
the numbers performed was Schubert’s Unfinished
Symphony—two movements, allegro and andante.
It was played in the usual way, with an interval
between the movements. But when the allegro
movement was completed, Brassey, Madden, and
MTntyre joined in the applause, and then turned
to their programmes to see what was to come next.
The next number down was a song from Weber’s
‘Der Freischiitz.’ But when the orchestra began
again on the andante of the symphony, the mix-
ture of bored anguish and amazement on the faces
of the illustrious three was comical. They looked
at their programmes and at each other, and then
had a whispered consultation, pointed to the next
item, elevated their eyebrows, and at last gave up
the puzzle.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
Appropiate scriptural welcome to N.S.W.
politicians visiting Japan : “To see the nakedness
of the land are ye come.”
In reply to a demand that the Yic. Govern-
ment should raise a loan and start a policy of
“reproductivepublic words,” Premier Turner re-
plied flatly that he didn’t know where to find any.
The Age falls on Turner very heavily over this
statement, yet in the sense the Yic. Premier pro-
bably intended the statement was logical enough.
There is hardly such a thing to be found now as a
new public work that will pay, for years to come,
the full interest on the money borrowed, even at
3 per cent., for its construction. There are any
number of new railways and water conservation
works wanted which would pay perhaps 1\ per
cent, immediately and more afterwards, and these
provinces will have to tackle them seriously before
long, or else petrify. But if they are built with
borrowed money the debt and the interest
deficiency are such a huge handicap that they will
probably not get anywhere near the paying point
for 200 years. The N.S.W. railways, for instance,
are doing better than some other systems, yet
they have nearly =68,000,000 of accumulated defi-
ciency to work off before they begin to be a profit-
able property.
An “ Arabian Nights ” story relates how
a certain fisherman found a very small pot sealed
with a cabalistic seal—and opened it —whereupon
out came a tremendous genie,, who spread over
heaven and earth before the fisherman could say
that the prawns in some Sydney shops go uncom-
monly high this weather. Something of the same
kind seems to be happening in the Carruthers-
Norton libel-case. This case started in a small,
mild way over a piece of land which, it was
alleged in Norton’s paper Truth, had been im-
properly or foolishly dealt with by Carruthers
in his capacity as Lands Minister; but the
original, dry, technical little case has spread
so fast and so furiously into alleged de-
tails of the private life of all manner of
people that the early aspect of it threatens
to disappear altogether. At the present rate of
progress the little town where the case is being
heard will soon not be near large enough to hold
the witnesses who have come to swear to sensa-
tional things of one kind and another.
There are lots of escapes from collision at
Sydney Circular Quay which cause no fuss and
never get into the papers. As long as there is no
actual dull thud, and no bow driven five feet into
an opposing sponson, the reporter-man doesn’t
consider it his duty to make remarks ; for which
reason the public continues to plank down its
money in a joyous spirit for a passage which
may end in time, but has a good many chances
per thousand of ending in eternity. On Box-
ing Day, however, there was a very consider-
able thud, and the North Shore steamer Cammeray
sunk the Princess with such velocity that the last
of the passengers was barely dragged off in time
to save that person’s bacon. One moral stands
out pretty clearly from this and similar collisions:
no single-ended ferry-boat, which has to back out
and swivel round through crowded traffic, should
be allowed to ply from Circular Quay, The local
Marine Board is popularly understood to consist
of seven very old mummies, in a very bad state of
preservation, so nothing great in the way of reform
can be expected from it. But this very small
reform is hereby thrust under the Board’s collec-
tive nose, in the confident hope that the youngest
and least decayed mummy may be induced to
sneeze violently and wake up.

H. : “I suppose the rumor that Dan Barry
wanted Graham Berry to do King Lear, on shar-
ing terms, is a funniment. In a book called
‘Pillars of the Empire,’ poor Berry is elaborately
described as one of them. What a grand thing it
is to be a pillar. Reminds you of Falstaff’s
soliloquy on honor. Who hath it ? He that was
pensioned on Wednesday.”
It is likely that poor old M‘llwraith,
now that his day is done, thinks that if he had
his time to live over again he would do many
things differently. Among others, he probably
wouldn’t boot even the humble variety of press-
mam quite so hard. M‘llwraith, in the era of
his greatness and his stupendous overdraft, never
disguised his low opinion of the ordinary news-
paper hack. And now a good many very small
hacks who, among them, might have done a good
deal to ease his downfall, are getting square with
their ancient contemner.
Henry George delivered six orations on
the day of his death. He went to bed tired and
worn out —woke up a few hours later complaining
of illness, and died of apoplexy 30 minutes after-
wards. They placed the body in state at the
Grand Central Palace, and 90,000 people came to
take a last look. There was an enormous funeral,
and then a parade at night, to which every labor
organisation in N.Y. sent a delegation, and the
police had to stop the thousands of non-official
workmen who wanted to join in. All of which
goes to show that the great idealist was not with-
out honor even in his own country, and his own
generation.
“In ’62,” writes “Three Up,” “Bill
Price faced the sand-fly and mosquito and went
Out Back to do battle with droughts, heat-waves,
sandy-blights and sundries. In camp Bill drank
strong tea and plenty of it, and at the
local shanties he never drank beer if he
could get anything stronger. Some-
times he chewed tobacco, sometimes
smoked a pipe ; but he mostly had a
pipe in one side his mouth and a
“chew” in the other. As might be
expected, it sent him under (’twas the
drink, J think), and he died near
Louth, N.S.W., the other day, aged
98 years.”
As a councillor of the munici-
pality of St. Kilda (Vic.), Premier
Turner is still the commonplace,
tinpot, suburban magnate he was
prior to entering Parliament, 10 years
ago, unaltered but for the fact that
the “ dignity ” peculiar to the munici-
pal councillor has become inflated in
proportion to his advance. The other
day, at the St. Kilda Council, he
raised a royal row about the playing
of a band on the local Esplanade on
Sundays, not from pious motives, but
because such a crowd collected that
the premyah and his “ sweet ”
couldn’t conveniently get past to
church.

Saturday aged 83, was once something of a power
in cornstalk politics. He entered the Assembly
in ’69, and was Treasurer in the first Parkes
Ministry, and Minister for Mines in the second.
He was also one of the founders of the A.M.P.
Society, and in his earlier days he was a dis-
tinctly Liberal politician. Then, when he
became too old to be much use, the miser-
able nominee system shunted him into the
Council, and all that this generation remembers of
him is that he was a very feeble and conservative
and ordinary old man of no special account. The
system of appointing Councillors for life seems
specially devised to enable politicians to outlive
their reputations.
G. W. Steevens, in a London Daily Matt
article, entitled “ Under the Iron Heel,” thus
describes Kaiser Wilhelm as seen recently in
Berlin
A man of middle size, sitting constrainedly and bolt up-
right, a dead yellow skin, hard-pencilled brows, a straight,
masterful nose, lips jammed together under a dark
moustache, pointing straight upward to the whites of his
eyes ; a face at once repulsive and pathetic, so harsh and
stony was it, so grimly solemn ; a face in which no indi-
vidual feature was very dark, but which altogether was
black as thunder. He raised his gloved hand in a stiff,
mechanical salute, and turned his head impassively from
left to right, but there was no courtesy in the salute, no
light in the eye, no smile on the tight mouth for his loyal
subjects. He looked like a man without joy, without
love, without pity, without hope. He looked like a man
who had never laughed, like a man who could never
sleep. A man might wear such a face who felt himßelf
turning slowly into ice.
The eternal Chief Justice Madden has
been elected as Chancellor of Melbourne Univer-
sity in succession to Brownless. There isn’t an
honorary billet in Melbourne now, with any
dignity and any chance of wearing long petticoats
in it, that Madden doesn’t get elected to.
Hassel, manager of Olive Downs station
(N.S.W.), is considered one of the smartest and
most daring men amongst cattle in the backblocks.
He is a novelty, besides. He has never been
known to swear, and no cuss-words are allowed to
circulate on his station. Consequently his men
near choke ” at times for want of ventilation in
that respect. One old whaler, who couldn’t exist
without an occasional explosion, rode across to
Whittahranah run one Sunday, and spent half
the day on Back Creek pouring out all the im-
prisoned accumulated blanky of months. How-
ever that may be. Back Creek never holds water
now. There’s a fiery drought there.
It is announced that Dr. Cockburn is to
succeed Play ford as S.A. Agent-General. This
will leave Kingston and Holder as the two survi-
vors of the original Ministry which took office in
June, ’93. Cockburn is Scotch, 47 years of age,
and, during his 13 years of office, he has been
Premier once, Chief-Secretary twice, and twice
Minister of education. His departure from
S.A., if it really happens, will be another result
of the Adelaide Hospital row, which has been
the cause of nearly everything that has happened
m S.A. for two years past. As a member of the
Kingston Government, Cockburn is practically
ostracised by the profession which takes off your
leg for a consideration, and, as a consequence, his
practice is probably hardly worth keeping now.
An highly-ornamented tatooed relic of last-
century Maoriland went to the Happy Greenstone
Land lately at an unspeakable age from Kahia-
pohia (Kaiapoi). Paari Taki (Paul Stack as he
was christened when he ceased to be a stout pagan
and became a dubious Christian) was a great man
down South, and to show his gratitude to a Kapai
Government which made him a native assessor he
wore a bell-topper—the rest of his clothing was a
flax mat. Paari was a fighting man in the expedi-
tion oi 200 warriors which was sent up to Cook’s
Strait in days when the century was young to deal
out utu (stoush) upon Te Rauparaha after that
gory savage’s descent on Kaiapoi. There were
giants in M.L. in those days, and of these Thaia
Taihewa, Pita Te Hori, Hakopa Te Ataotu,
INatanahira Warawarautu, Horomona Pohia,
Thaia Tainui (you will find their illustrious but
discordant names graven on Kemp’s deed of June,
’4B) have “gone over” to Shad'owland. Paari,
like all of his race, dealt largely in numbers, and
was wont to tell how he was personally cognisant
of the eating of 70,000 Maoris in his early fighting
dayß.
RICHARDSON, FROM A BATSMANS
POINT OF VIEW.
A coincidence : In 1885 Premier King-
ston’s brother, who had been sent to gaol for
taking a hilarious pot-shot with a pistol at a pass-
ing cabman, was released “ in order that he might
enjoy his Christmas dinner at liberty.” On
Christmas-eve just past Kingston let out Jewell
for the same purpose, after seven days of hi? six
weeks’ sentence had been served. Jewell was the
man with two stumps who pounded Kingston
cheerfully on the head with a walking-stick.
S.A. law has just sent a broken-down
old miner of 60 to gaol for six months for not sup-
porting his grandchild. The said child’s father is
well-off at Broken Hill, but, as he is out of tlie
jurisdiction of the S.A. Court, and the S.A. law
is too tired to take proceedings in N.S.W., it gets
square by jugging the grandfather. Which seems
a little rough on the latter somehow.
Ite Kaiser William's hiccupy talk about
the German St. Michael planting the Imperial
eagle in China : St. Michael and his sword of
flame seem to lie the particular straws in William’s
hair. He recently set an artist to work upon an
allegorical picture of himself in the archangelic
character—wings, nightshirt, fiery sword, and all
complete. Apparently William the Sudden is
going mad very fast of late.

Queer old “ Hoppy ” Hopkins, Vic.
Western District squatter, ex-Geelong Mayor
and M.L.A., has gone under, and Turner will
gather in another handsome cheque for probate
duty, unless there is truth in the vague rumor
that Hopkins suffered many financial disasters of
late years. “Hoppy” was the strange old man of
Vic. politics. _ He was eccentric and slouchy in
dress, and his clothes always looked as if they
had fallen on him from a great height. His suits
excited painful speculation in gilded ball-rooms
by reason of the fact that two-thirds of the time
they seemed to be on the point of falling off, but
Hopkins always hitched them up at the critical
moment, with a weird spasm of his long body,
and saved the situation. Hopkins had a kindly
heart, like many other unusual-lookingmen, and did
many kind actions in a certain convulsive fashion
of his own. He leaves a young widow behind
him, and his death is said to have cast a gloom
over Geelong. But ali ttle additional gloom would
not be noticeable in Geelong, anyhow.
Dear Bulletin, —Some people will per-
sistently keep up the legend that Margaret Catch-
pole is identical with the late Mrs. Reibey. If
your correspondent “G. 8.” will take the trouble
to turn to last edition of “Margaret Catch pole ”
he will find an ample apology by the author of
that book, Rev. Cobbold, for his mistake. Here
are a few comparative dates. Margaret Catch-
pole was born in Suffolk, 1773 ; arrived in Aus-
tralia, 1801 ; married , 1812. Mrs. Reibey (nee
Mary Haydock) was born in Lancashire, 12th
May, 1777 ; arrived in Australia, 1790 ; married,
1792 (at the age of 15). Her husband, Thomas
Reibey, died 1810, two years before Margaret
Catchpole was married. Of her seven children
none are living, but these are the birth dates of
her grandchildren, viz., Thomas Reibey, of En-
tally (Tas.), born 1820, and James Thomson, of
Burrier, Shoalhaven, born 24th Aug. 1824, re-
spectively 8 and 12 years after Margaret Catch-
pole’s marriage. If it is maintained that these
people are Margaret Catchpole’s grandchildren
that lady’s immediate descendants must have
married very young indeed.—T.M.T.
Captain Curling was Police Magistrate at
Napier, M.L., in 1859. Mrs. Curling “led
sassiety ” there. A strong detachment of the 65th
Regt. was quartered at Napier then, and Curling,
in the course of his duties, had to issue warrants
of arrest against two of the officers for debt. So
one morning, when Mrs. Curling read over the
list of invitations for a ball, Curling told her that
the two best dancers couldn’t come because they
were under lock and key. Then one of those
things that Wragge describes came along. When
it was over, Curling went down to his office
pledged to release the pair, and, as the only way
out of the difficulty, a document was drawn up
and signed, by which they agreed, upon their
honor, that if they were released to attend the
ball they would return to gaol immediately
afterwards. They went to the ball, where they
met the man who had jugged them; and they
kicked him out of the house and pitched him into
the lagoon. Then they went on dancing—with
Mrs. Curling chiefly, and when the ball was over
they struggled up the big hill at the back of the
town and went to their quarters in the barracks
very drunk. They were so drunk that they
forgot all about their honor. And when they got
sober they thought it was too late to remember
what they had forgotten. In the end, Curling
had to mortgage his screw for six months to pay
the debt and placate the creditor’s feelings and
soothe his bruises. Ani when, afterwards, those
two young gentlemen came to grief in the Maori
war, and one was shot dead, and the other was so
badly wounded that he had to leave the army,
Curling got drunk—with joy principally.
. Samuel Davenport, aged 79, the lone sur-
vivor of the first S.A. Ministry under Responsible
Government, still does the Adelaide block. He
was appointed Commissioner of Public Works in
March, 1857, though his Parliamentary career
started as early as ’46. Finniss, the first S A
Premier, died a few years ago.
About £2OOO has been subscribed for
the William Clarke statue, and the bronze image
of that ancient, ordinary millionaire will soon be
under way. If they want to make it a life-like
statue, however, there should be another man on
the pedestal besides Clarke, and the latter should
be lending, the other man something. No statu6
of the good-natured old man could be lifelike
unless it represented him in the act of having
something borrowed from him.

Dear Bulletin, —The visit of Lord
Ardilaun reminds me of a general election in
Dublin in the pre-ballot days. Lord A. was at
that time Sir Arthur Guinness and head of the
great brewery; he was also a candidate for the
city. A peculiarly Irish placard was posted on
every wall, reading : “ He that is not for us is
agin us (A. Guinness). —Hebrews xx.” During
same election the whiskyfied Jehu who drove me
across town (he was a freeman and entitled to a
vote) told me en passant that he had received £5
each from agents of two candidates for his vote,
and the committee for the third had paid him £7
for hire of car to block him from voting at all.
Being a trifle confused as to the morality of all
this, I asked him whom he intended voting for.
“Be jabers, yer ’anner, I axed the praste, an’ he
towld me they were all heretics, and a bad lot, and
not to vote at all, and nayther I will, blasht
them.”— Harry Monck.
Brisbane Street, a publication with a
splendid bump of language, thus discourses on a
local M.L.A.
He has the intelligence of a ’bus proprietor ;
and, when he chooses, the manners of a bear. The Street
is open to bet that he does not read six decent books in
any average six months and could not speak intelligently
for six minutes on any principle of civic management.
He is the very type of your small-minded, hide-bound,
pig-headed, out-of-date Fat Man.
Then the writer hurries on to another man and
remarks
The Street understands that Mr. Blank is shortly com-
ing to Brisbane. Mr. Blank is an unparalleled scoundrel;
and if he does come, this gentle paper will write him such
a puff biographical as shall move him to the depths. The
Street loves unutterable cads who go round the world
under a score of aliases and live on the trifles they feloni-
ously pilfer from decent people.
There’s nothing weakly circuitous about that
streak of eloquence, anyhow.
“The accused,” insinuated Judge Win-
deyer in his summing up of the Suffield case, “is
stated to be a man of education. Colonel Baker
was an educated man, which didn’t prevent him
from committing an offence similar to that with
which the accused is charged.” Which was, as
his Honor very well knew, absolutely untrue.
Col. Baker was never charged with rape’; but with
an indecent assault, about which there was not
even a suggestion of the brutality alleged against
Suffield.
The case in which J. H. Canuthers,
N.S.W. Lands Minister, sues John Norton for
criminal libel, developed an unexpected patch of
interest the other day, when Norton put into the
box a female witness who said such remarkable
things that Carruthers’s counsel asked the pre-
siding Judge not to allow publication until the
other side had been heard. The presiding Judge
(Backhouse) made the order as requested, and
established what seems to be a precedent in
criminal cases.
The publicans in a distant Westralian
mining-camp have started a bottle-breaking club
to keep the hop-beer men from using the empties
and thereby injuring their business. The rules
are very simple; so much a shot (the amount
varies according to the drunkenness of the com-
petitor), and as little as the publican can get the
winner to take for each broken bottle—the money
to be spent in liquor. There is one lady in the
club; she wildly swipes her half-brick at the
bottle as representative of her husband, who can’t
aim straight because he is blind in one eve and
cross-eyed in the other.
Ed. Bulletin, — Your par. re horse found
dead with bell-chain cut into his neck reminds
me that, back in the sixties, a bullock yarded in
Namoi district, N.S.W., had a bow and half a
yoke on, and the bow, buried slantwise in his
neck, had cut its way into the bone, the attached
half-yoke hanging down. The flesh had healed
perfectly sound, leaving only a little sore on each
side of neck where the bow went through. The
beast had been so often chased in that dense
brigalow scrub that he could gallop as safely as
any old warrior with 4ft. horns, and never strike
a tree—with the bow sticking out on one side and
the half-yoke swinging on the other !—R.F.

the derelict’s tracks. They found him naked,

Dear Bulletin, —A fortune awaits the
man who can discover a dead-sure preventive or
cure for fly-bunged eyes. Every third man you
meet m the bush, just now, has to do his seeing*
with one blinker—a fly having closed the other
for repairs. To have both lamps bunged up at
once means inexpressible suffering and total
blindness for at least three days. Although every
summer my eyes close up alternately once a week
or so, I ve never yet been able to catch the fly in
flagrante. You never feel the actual bite or sting.
An itchy sensation sets in suddenly, and imme-
diately after the eye starts swelling, and continues
swelling for a day and a half, then slowly goes
“°'Y n again to normal for the next day and a
Once the eye has begun to swell, nothing on
earth I know of can stop it. Little pain, but the
itching is almost unbearable. The general help-
°f babies and drunks makes them a verit-
able gift to the flies. Opinions differ as to the
particular kind of fly that does the mischief. Some
hold its a small, black breed, whose special
mission on earth is to bung-up eyes and die.
Others think it’s the ordinary house-fly, which,
after feasting on putrid matter, poisons the eye’
up or nose when touching it. Anyhow, to my
knowledge no one has ever yet caught or even seen
the mysterious insect. Can any of your snake or
fish authorities enlighten me?—R.H.

Travelling by coach, some time ago, in
company with a stock-and-station-agent, in tha
Darling backbloeks, we were persuaded to play
“ bottle-100 ” with the driver, for a shilling a time.
The one who sees a bottle first calls “ bottle,” and,
if it is really a bottle and unbroken, the other
players pay him a shilling each. Should it be a
broken bottle or a jam-tin, or something of that
sort, the one who calls pays a shilling all round.
We had played this for some time, the driver
“getting a bit ahead of it” every mile, when I
noticed a crafty smile on his face, and decided to
be careful. I saw a square gin-bottle lying on the
roadside, but determined to pay one shilling rather
than tvyo, and kept quiet. The agent, however,
yelled “Bottle!” when the driver remarked,
“That’s a bob all round ; it’s broken.” When we
came up to it, it was apparently whole, but the
driver pulled up and asked me to turn it over. I
did so, and found a big hole in it. “ How did you
know it was broken ? ” “ Because I put it there 1 ,
broken side down, on my last trip.” We thought
we would play a little longer, although by this
time not sweet on the game. After losing about
30s. between us to the driver, we were surprised
to hear him say “ Bottle ” in a matter-of-fact
style, without looking up from his horses.
“ Where ?” we asked. “ See that bush ? There’s
a small medicine-bottle in it.” When we came
alongside, we could just see it stuck on a twig.
Said the driver, with a reminiscent look on his
face, “ I put that bottle there about eight years
ago, and I’ve done pretty well out of it, for such
a little one.” I decided I was a mug. I don’t'
play bottle-100 with coach-drivers any more.—

A German workman has been lying for
weeks in Perth Hospital with a wrecked spine.
He and others were working at an old brick wall,
when an alarm was given that the wall was
falling. The others ran, but the German, a man
of phenomenal strength, acting on an impulse,
set his back against the wall. “ I vos a tain fool,”
he said to his mate, when awaiting death in the
hospital, “ I thought I could prop up a brick
wall.” The writer saw a manifestation of the
same impulse once in Gippsland. A settler
falling a tree noticed as it began to go that his
brother was walking within range, and ran and put
his hands to the falling butt. Sense came to him
in time, and he jumped clear. The brother was
killed by a somersaulting limb. This same un-
reason is probably responsible for many so-called
heroic actions.

Dear Bulletin, —You have grievously
man-handled Young Australia for his supineness
in allowing his politics to be made in Germany,
London, and other foreign parts. I think the
reason why the imported politician flourishes like
a green bay-tree in Australia whilst the local pro-
duct is a comparative failure lies in the uncon-
vincing nature of Australian stump-oratory. And
Australian stump-oratory is dismal and lacking in
grip and go because of the great Australian
adjective. In ordinary life the Australian who
wishes to be incisive and carry conviction illumin-
ates his speech with innumerable blankies, and
his conversation goes like a cavalry charge ; but
when he arises in public to state his case and air
his opinions before a mixed audience, he has to
drop his crimson adjective, and is presently a
terrified and bewildered wretch, bushed in the
tangled ruins of ten-thousand unfinished sen-
tences. He starts out well, and gets along all
right until he strikes the place where the first gory
expletive should come in, then he suddenly recol-
lects himself, baulks badly, and the sentence goes
to pieces on his lips. This happens 25 times in 25
minutes till the audience gets tired and derisive,
and the orator’s speech, when looked back upon,
seems about as coherent as a dictionary that
has been run through a chaff-cutter. There
are only two remedies. We must sanctify blanky
and make it permissible in polite society, or else
repress it with the utmost rigor of the law, so that
the new generation may accustom itself to think-
ing without the assistance of the present indis-
pensable bloodshed.— Silas Snell.

NOTICE.— White Stab Line of Coaches.— The Owner
desires to notify that after battling through the winter
he has received, on the first day of summer, one
week’s notice to leave, the stables, and consequently
the “ White Star Coach ” will make her last trip under
the present Management on Monday night. The Pro-
prietor wishes to thank those residents who have
so loyally supported him during the eight months
the Opposition were trying to crawl into his
stables ; and leaves the Public to decide whether their
interests are best served by having “ only one ” coach
running to “only one house.”
In justice to Mr. , the Proprietor of the Line
desires to state that Mr. is also entirely exonerated
from the serious charge of having stolen a Grey
Cat from the Hotel, as the valuable feline turned up
about two hours after Mr. had started for
Kaikoura. Neither Mr. or his boss bear the Grey
Cat any ill-will, and they both trust that she may long be*
permitted to shriek at the midnight moon undisturbed by
the actions of any unprincipled adventurer.
Ohingaiti, November 9, 1897.

The ways of the country lock-up keeper
would do credit to the Heathen Chinee. When
cut firewood runs short the keeper simply looks
out for a guileless blackfellow, gets a couple of
nobblers of rum into him, and then runs him in.
Fined 10s. or seven days’ look-up. As if any
blackfellow had 10s. about him! The wood-
splitting commences at once, and lasts, with an
occasional turn at white-washing, the whole seven
days. Fact.

The Bulletin will be glad to receive, for
publication, from all c ters, tersely-expressed
comments on the Suffieid case —which it regards
as involving one of the most cruel injustices ever
perpetrated by law in Australia. The case is
forcefully set forth in Mr. A. G. Stephens’
pamphlet, published by The Bulletin and post-
free from this office for 7d. in stamps.
Mr. Frank Senior, who has been chemist
to the N.S. Wales Governors for many years past,
has conferred a blessing upon the citizens of his
country by discovering a wonderful cure for head-
ache. The new remedy cures instantaneously, is
very palatable, and perfectly harmless to both
ladies and gentlemen. Moreover, it is perfectly
effectual, no matter what the cause of the head-
ache may be. This cure, the result of years of
experience, can be had in 3 sizes, by post 1/4, 2/6,
3/8. Senior, chemist, George-street, Sydney.*

In connection with these easy-running machines, we have just issued a daintily
got-up brochure, fully illustrated, entitled “ Cycling for Ladies,” containing
some very useful hints for beginners , and for those who are anxious to look as
smart as possible when wheeling. A really good hint given and received at
the right time often decides the all-important question of whether a lady looks
awkward or elegant when cycling. For those interested in cycling from the
racing standpoint, we have also issued a little souvenir booklet, containing an
account of the distinguished

rider, C. F. Barden, whose appearance ALONE on the scratch mark of the
Austral Wheel Race made the Swift the cynosure of all eyes. This Xmas
season we are sending to all our old customers an entertaining Xmas story,
entitled “ Xmas in A ustralia ,” illustrated by our own special artist. Should
any of these esteemed patrons be accidentally omitted from our list—which is
a very lone one- —a post-card to any of our depots will command instant
attention.

Holdar M. : “ Was one of a recent audience In a city
theatre, following the march of a realistic drama. I
studied surrounding faces, and marked how the mass
palpitated with pleasure upon the hero’s release from
prison, where he had been interned upon stage suspicion
compared to which that against Suffield was of heavy cir-
cumstantial calibre. Why do people throb with vitality at
the consummation of an understood effect, yet remain
deaf to the cry of real flesh and blood, praying not for
sensational release but merely for unbiased attention ?
Haresfoot : “ When Mr. Wilson Barrett’s ‘ Sign of the
Cross ’ co. was in Norwich, the representative of Nero
read the prayers in Church one Sunday morning. The
time will come when theatrical companies will be com-
pelled to attend church for advertising purposes, just as
tire coachman had to come in to prayers, which, he
hoped, would be remembered in the wages.”
Haresfoot : “ Lawrence Barrett, U.S. tragedian, re-
cently defunct, was engaged by Williamson for Australia,
ten years ago, but broke his engagement, to go on the
road with Edw’in Booth. A more legitimate type of actor
than his no-ways relative Wilson Barrett, he was yet
something like the Britisher on a lighter scale.”
N. : “The lovely' grace of dancing is carried to such
an excess as to be demoralising. It is poisonous to the
children. A horrible type of thin girl-child is created,
with pasty face and clubby hair.”
Viator: “In English provincial travelling theatrical
companies now, the agreements require actors and ac-
tresses to be well-dressed ‘both off and on the stage.’
Consequently, it is getting to be a point of honor with
stars to dress shabbily, just to show they are not common
cattle, amenable to the manager’s threats. A very similar
distinction between the china and earthenware of the
profesh is that which requires the stock actor to walk
across the stage in taking a call before the curtain,
whereas the leading people only come out and bow.”
When Dampier was touring Victoria not very long
ago the co. did a one-night season at a small
town. Next morning Alfred Rolfe was on deck
when a cordial inhabitant called in to congratu-
late him. “ You did that very well,” he said,
shaking Rolfe by the hand; “I knew when I saw you
doing it that Bill Stone must have called in and given
you a few hints.” Rolfe intimated that he was glad the
inhabitant had enjoyed the piece, but that unfortunately'
Bill Stone hadn’t called. The inhabitant was not only
surprised ; he was pained. “ Bill must be unwell,” he
decided ; “ when a new company comes here Bill always
calls on them and gives them a few hints. I don’t know
how some of them would get on without. It’s a wonder
ful advantage to a travelling company to get a few hints
from a man like Bill Stone.” “Well, who is Bill Stone ? ”
demanded Rolfe, a trifle irritably. “What? Don’t you
know him? Why, Bill’s one of the best actors in this
country. He lives just down the street. You oughter
see him act. Why', I’ve seen him go across that stage in
two jumps.” Then Rolfe, who couldn’t go.across the
stage in less than three jumps himself, apologised for his
ignorance and retired discomfited.
An envelope from Bland Holt can be picked out of a
thousand, with his back hand and the thick strokes of his
quill. The postman in Melb., Sydney, Brisbane, or all
over Maoriland, will say, “ Bland again.”
Overheard in a London drawing-room. Mrs. R. : “ Have
you been to the Pavilion, dear?” Mrs. G. : “ Oh, yes—
last night. Such a lovely programme ! So very inde-
cent ” 1 !
Some or the girls at the Melb. theatre-bars, in their
eagerness to push business for the show, have a painful
habit of asking, “ Are you going inside?” From a medi-
cal point of view, the question is superflous. Every man
who takes frequent doses of theatre-bar whisky' is pretty
certain to be going inside, if not already gone.
Cockaigne : “ Goddard’s ‘ Players of the Period j states'
that Mr. Wilson Barrett first appeared at Halifax, in 1864,
aged 18, so that he would now be 51. He used to live at
the Priory, St. John’s Wood, the house once occupied
by George Eliot. There is a pretty little yarn bandied in
his biogs. One winter’s night, in the snow, he reached
h >me, and found a boy shivering outside. The boy only
wanted to look at him. Barrett took him in and gave him
supper, and sent him home with all that remained for his
mother, and a bottle of wine, too. The boy was to call
at the theatre next morning for a billet as messenger.
However, Mr. Cobbe, the acting-manager, recognised
this Arab as a girl, who, in her own clothes, had asked
him for work. Presumably the pathetic maid was
mashed on Barrett. Some time afterwards the girl was
sent to prison by the oity magistrates for personating a
boy."
Mahlstick : “The Students’ Exhibition, just open at
Melb. National Art Gallery, brings out the ideal Trilby
of the trustees, the Trilby whom they probably regard
as specially adapted for the Altogezzare, as Svengarly
says. lam sorry to write disparagingly of a person who
may combine the mind of a Florence Nightingale with a
frame which I must term stringy, cow -like, and absolutely
unpicturesque. Far better to draw only from the Venuses
of Medici, Milo, the Anadyomene, and Canova.”
First nights at Melb Princess’s are religiously attended
by a man with a famous, infectious laugh. It is a valu-
able laugh to the management. On the first night of
“ The French Maid,” the maid was singing about the bad
bold lodger who called her into the bedroom and chucked
her under the chin, and when she got to the refrain —
“ What did he take me for? ” the audience was just for a
moment inclined to feel shocked. Then the laugh came
and broke up the awful silence.
Paper Cap: “Maybe the scribe who enthused over
Naphtha Joseph Dias, as the star low comedian of
eighteen hundred and fast-asleep, got it from little Joe
hisself. This was the case. Joe obtained his chance—the
only one—at Bendigo, or somewhere. It was as Toby
Twinkle, in ‘ All that Glitters is Not Gold.’ He knocked
that Bendigo audience; but, would you believe it, he
never got another show. No one now living can tell the
reason why. You need to live behind the scenes, and get
to know the hanky-panky.”
H. : “‘Olaudian’ is based on Godwin’s novel, ‘St.
Leon.’ Nobody can help observing how inferior the three
last acts are to the very strong first one, in which Willard,
as Father Clement, divided the honors with Barrett.
When the original production was a bit of a rage, Toole
appeared in a burlesque by Burnand, ‘ Paw Claude,’ in
which very subtle observers were supposed to discern
‘ Pork Lard.’ ” The exact value of “ Pork Lard ” when it
was discerned is uncertain.
Daniel Emmett, born 1815, father of negro-minstrelsy
and composer of “ Dixie,” still lives at Mount Vernon,
U.S.A. He has seen all the others pass—Foster, Bryant,
Birch, Christie. Even the original minstrel has passed
away. What we have to-day is but a variety of the
variety-show.
A London paper remarks that Boucicault — our Bouci-
cault —is no stranger at the Court Theatre, where he now
occupies the managerial chair. Some 17 years ago, when
his brother-in-law, John Clayton, was bossing the show,
Boucicault played at the Court in his ow’n little comedy
of “ My Little Girl,” taken from Besant’s novel.
Cockaigne : “ Most of Irving’s engrained stage eccen-
tricities are through defective sight. Buckstone was so
deaf that he had to watch the mouths of the other per-
formers.”
Haresfoot : “Talking of Sunday Thespic Obsequies,
never will I forget the fair Ophelia’s. Nothing impresses
the clergy so much with the deep-hid theological bent of
the theatrical profession as meeting its members at a
funeral, or discussing Scripture with an actor on a steam-
boat deck by night. If you can only get an actor or actress
to church, they are the churchiest people there. If a
civilian, so to speak, says prayers into his belltopper half-
a-minute, a Wilson Barrett will take a whole one. Well,
when Ophelia was buried, Sir Peter Teazle, the Panto-
mime Monarch, the Fairy Muslina, and the rest, quite
made me cry, too.”
The w'ife of a very toney professional man has a sister
married to a most disreputable bummer. The toney lady
excuses her husband’s relationship by explaining that the
bummer “is not my husband’s brother-in-law, he (the
bummer) is only married to my sister.”
Dear Bulletin,—You call attention to the fact that the
trustees of Melb. cemetery have £20,000 in hand, and
don’t know what to do with it. Why not advise them to
spend a £lO-note or two in refixing some of the tomb-
stones and railings that have dropped out of plumb
through the dropping out of people who onetime paid for
the tending of these now’ neglected graves.—Actor.

Blood and Fire : Can you swear to it on your own personal,
immortal curse ? L.M.D.: We cut off the last two verses

his case heard at ah open public enquiry.
Alb. : “Clerical celibacy is a Papal ordin-
ance, about 900 years old, and could be abrogated,
though it won't. What strikes me is the absurdity
of the Protestant opposition. The youngest and
most stalwart clergy of the Protestant sects are
kept in celibacy. The one with the best chance of
getting among the females of the flock is the
learned, spectacled, sapless little tadpole of the
craft —a pale, anaemic atomy, with feeble body and
bulbous head. The Protestant theory is, that if a
clergyman can afford it he has irresistible carnal
and sinful impulses, but if he can’t, he hasn’t.
Let sauce for the goose be sauce for the gander.”
“The Suffield Case,” a 64 pp. pamphlet

A stylishly-dressed woman called at a
certain Melbourne hospital to be treated as an
out-door patient. In the middle of the examina-
tion the doctor stopped and said: “Look here,
do you ever wash yourself ? ” Gasped the woman:
“ Yes, of course I do—on the parts that require it.”
Dr.: “ Well, go home and get a bar of soap and
wash yourself on the parts .‘•hat don’t require it
for a change. ”
Pathetic hunk from recent discourse of
Bishop Stone-Wigg, just down from New Guinea.
“We lately sent two Kanaka teachers to serve
four villages. On the day of their arrival great
festivities were proceeding, in which they joined
heartily. They discovered next day they had
unwittingly participated in a cannibal feast.' There
had been a battle with a mountain tribe, and one
of the enemy had been taken captive and used as
material for a banquet.” By the way, oughtn’t a
teacher or missionary who unwittingly participates
in such a spread to be suspended a while from his
ghostly functions—long enough, at least, to let
him get the taste of the lamented fried brother
out of his mouth?

IN AND ABOUND MELBOURNE.


A Story of Dread and Gratitude.
A tale of surpassing interest to the afflicted,
who unhappily constitute a large percentage of
humanity, could be evolved from the many and
curious expressions of gratitude which have
emanated during the past few years from sufferers
in all parts of the world, who have been made
whole through the agency of one simple dis-
covery.
What an insight do these records give us into
the miseries and agonies borne by the human
race ! Wbat splendid examples of endurance,
gratitude, and even heroism under cruel tortures ’l
What thrilling incidents of courageous struggles
with the demons of destruction, and of simple
faith in the honesty and ability of the rescuer to
save, do they afford !
h rom every quarter of the globe these personal
histories ha e been gathered, from every nation,
and from all peoples. From ice-bound wanderers
in Arctic snows, and from dwellers under Southern
palms. From the stately cities of the Old World
and the far-off corners of the great American con-
tinent ; from the vast plains of Australia, the
lonely veldts of Africa, and the coral islets of
Southern seas, Christian, Turk, and Pagan unite
in swelling the volume of gratitude which has
awakened the world to the supreme merits of ST.
JACOBS OIL. Every wind that blows carries
with it many-tongued acknowledgments of salva-
tion from physical wreck by the world’s Great
Pain Conqueror, and the experiences of the vic-
tims go to make up a story of dread, the harrow-
ing nature of which is only alleviated by the
revelations of their escapes' from the King of
Terrors through its instrumentality. The few
extracts given herewith are taken from a volume
which tells in detail the history of their sufferings
and the hopelessness of their prospects under
every other description of treatment.
Names and addresses are given as guarantees of
accuracy, and the reward of .£100, offered many
years ago by the proprietors of St. Jacobs Oil, is
still payable to any person who will prove satis-
factorily that any of the testimonials published in
the interests of this marvellous curative agent are
other than genuine. The book is opened hap-
hazard, and the record made without any attempt
at classification :
Mr. .T. Marlow, merchant tailor, of 11 Flinders-
street East, Melbourne, tried every known remedy
suggested for rheumatism, which had troubled
him for five-and-twenty years, and cost him large
sums of money. St. Jacobs Oil gave him relief on
its first application, and eventually drove the
rheumatism from his system.
Mrs. Mason, of Young-street, Redfern, cured a
severe attack of neuralgia by the application of St.
Jacobs Oil, after all other so-called remedies had
failed.
Mr. John Taylor, of Messrs. M‘Ewan and Co.,
of Melbourne, asserts, out of the depths of his own
experience, that St. Jacobs Oil is a certain cure
for lumbago and toothache. He had both badly,
and claims to know.
Mr. Maurice D. Benjamin, of Brisbane, had
grave doubts about the power of St. Jacobs Oil to
conquer rhejjmatism, but, when he had an oppor-
tunity of putting it to a personal test, he cheer-
fully acknowledged its wonderful capacity for kill-
ing pain and giving rest.
Mr. William Beach, the Australian oarsman
who lowered Hanlan’s colors, found St. Jacobs
Oil of the greatest service to him when training,
because he could always use it successfully for the
relief and cure of stiffness, cramps, and all muscu-
lar pains.
Mr. Frank Stephens, of Auckland, was lame
from an injured knee for many months. All
remedies recommended and tried were unsuccess-
ful, but St. Jacobs Oil removed every trace of pain
on a second application.
Mr. Edward Hanlan, the great American
sculler, and, for a long time, champion oarsman
of the world, strongly recommended St. Jacobs
Oil when he was in Australia, more particularly
for muscular pains in the limbs.
Mr. G. Brett, the champion amateur oarsman
of Australia, looked upon St. Jacobs Oil as
having been specially prepared to meet his suffer-
ings, and expressed the opinion that no boat-house
or training-quarters should be without it.
Mr. A. H. Jarvis, of the Hindmarsh Cricket
Club, Adelaide, constantly used it for accidents
in the cricket-field, and bears hearty testimony to
the yirtues attending its use as a remedy for all
sprains and bruises.
Mr. G. Alexander, a prominent member of an
Australian Eleven expresses his gratitude for the
services rendered by St. Jacobs Oil to the mem-
bers of the team when in England, where it was
for all accidents happening in the field.
Mr. Harry Rickards, the popular comedian and
theatrical manager, whom everybody knows,
emphasises his opinion as to the valuable proper-
ties of St. Jacobs Oil by referring to an occassion
when he was so ill with cold and pains in the
chest that he despaired of being able to appear on
the stage. He, however, used St. Jacobs Oil
freely and was in front of the footlights at the
appointed time free from all pain.
Mr. Harry Hoyte, the popular comedian, was
confined to his bed by an acute attack of rheuma-
tism, and. vainly experimented with many alleged
remedies ineffectually. Having no stage substi-
tute he was in despair, until St. Jacobs Oil was
tried, when he obtained instant relief and was
enabled to resume his professional duties.
Tiie above are but a very few of the opinions
expressed in Australia out of the enormous num-
ber that have been tendered. It would be im-
possible to reproduce them in a newspaper on
account of the space they would occupy and the
cost of insertion, but they are at all times open to
inspection.
Representative pharmacists throughout the
colonies have also cheerfully acknowledged, not
•nly the large sales effected by them, but the flat-
tering reception given to it in every instance by
their customers, whilst the leading wholesale
houses unanimously testify to its popularity and
success, following on the huge distribution of it
through their hands. The latest of these docu-
ments reads as follows :—
“Sydney, 7th October, 1897.
“ The Charles A. Yogeler Co.,
“Baltimore, U.S.A.
“ Gentlemen,
“We find by reference to our books that we
have sold, between November 30th, 1881, and
April 14th, 1897,
1,109,808 bottles
of St. Jacobs Oil.
“ It might be gratifying to you to know that no
other medical preparation that we have handled
during this period has anything like approached
the sale of St. Jacobs Oil.
“ We are, Yours faithfully,
“Elliott Bros. Ltd.”
Comment on such testimony as the above is ob-
viously unnecessary. There is no reading between
the lines ; there are no puppets to dance when the
strings are pulled. The one patent fact is that
St. Jacobs Oil is the one all-powerful conqueror of
every sort of pain, and that the public know it.*

USE ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT.’
It is Pleasant, Cooling, Soothing, Health-Giving, Refreshing and Invigorating.
YOU CANNOT OVERSTATE ITS GREAT VALUE IN KEEPINC THE BLOOD PURE AND FREE FROM DISEASE.
“AS an illustration of the beneficial effects of ENO’S ‘FRUIT
SALT,’ I have no hesitation in giving the particulars of the case of one of
my friends. SLUGGISH ACTION of the LIVER and BILIOUS HEADACHE
affected him, so he was obliged to live upon only a few articles of diet, and to be
most sparing in their use. This did nothing in effecting a cure, although persevered
in for twenty-five years, and also consulting eminent members of the faculty. By
the use of ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT’ he now ENJOYS VIGOROUS HEALTH ; he
has NEVER had a HEADACHE or CONSTIPATION since he commenced to use
it, about six months ago, and can partake of his food to the great satisfaction of
himself and friends. You may well extend its use pro bono publico. I find it makes a
VERY REFRESHING and INVIGORATING DRINK.—I remain, yours faith-
fully, J. W. Neil." —( From the late Rev. J. W. Neil, Holy Trinity Church, North Shields.)
HEADACHE and Disordered Stomach.— “ After suffering for nearly
two and a half years from SEVERE HEADACHE and DISORDERED
STOMACH, and after trying almost everything, and spending much money, with-
out finding any benefit, I was recommended by a friend to try ENO’S ‘ FRUIT
SALT,’ and, before I had finished one bottle I found it doing me a GREAT DEAL
of GOOD, and now I am RESTORED to MY USUAL HEALTH; and others I
know that have tried it have NOT ENJOYED such GOOD HEALTH for years.
— Yours most truly, Robert Humphreys, Post Office, Barrasford."
The effect of ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT’ on any DISORDERED and FEVERISH
condition is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact, NATURE’S OWN REMEDY
and an UNSURPASSED ONE.
CAUTION. -Examine each Bottle, and see CAPSULE is marked ENO'S ‘ FRUIT SALT.'
Without it,you have been imposed on by a WOE TH LESS imitation. Prepa?’ed only by

BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
These Bitters I recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chrome
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
! Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. :—The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of-Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costiveness.
j D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB-I find these Hitters a
I mast valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
i strengthening ; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
i tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
| G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
| exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.

“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
4i That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint)
will be as speiedily cured.

Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for “it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
a “ ROW’S STEANE’P WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to al
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION. —When you call for these ask for

POINTS
Q. Labor-member Sim (to Minister of
Education Dalrymple): “ Neither you nor I have
a prepossessing appearance.”
The S.A. Govt, has practically promised to
take up next session O’Malley’s bill to legitimatise
children born out of wedlock, but whose parents
subsequently marry.
The slogan of the victorious Tammany
J»rty at New York municipal elections (among
beer saloons of the Bowery, anyhow) was
lo Hell with reform.” No beastly hypocrisy
about that.
Brisbane (Q.) Worker editor Higgs is
mvited to run against M‘Master, M.P. for
Fortitude Valley, at next Parliamentary election.
Higgs, who has energy enough to run against the
archangel Gabriel himself if necessary, has
accepted.
c< In Q. Assembly. Labor-member Stewart :
“The Legislative Council is governing the
country ; the people’s representatives in this
House are only spectres.” Labor-member Cross
(sft. high and 14st. in weight): “Do you call me
a spectre ?”
The Westralian Parliament grovelled
greatly at the “ generous action ” of Premier For-
rest m proposing a £l5O annuity for the widow of
his late adversary, Gov. Broome. Blessed is the
man who can afford to pay his respects to a lady
at the public expense.
In the last days of the Maoriland session
Premier Seddon managed to pass a common-sense
resolution to the effect that the unfinished busi-
ness of this year shall be taken up again next year
at the point where it left off. Hitherto, M.L. has
gone on the old British fool system by which
everything has to be started afresh with a new
Bession, and all the oceans of conversation gone
over again from the beginning.
Somers Vine has
spoken hopefully and
patronisingly of the de-
bilitated Federal Council.
If that institution stands
this last shock people
will begin to believe in
its enduring vitality. The
approval of Somers Vine
is generally fatal.
Official estimate of
colored population (other
than aborigines) in Q. :
Chinese, 7888; Kanakas,
8248 ; Japs, 2632 ; Jav
nese, 468; other Asiatics,
948. Does the last num-
ber include all the In-
dians, Syrians, Persians,
&c. ? It looks mighty
small. However, the
total estimate reaches
20,184.
Again stated that Q.
Premier Nelson intends
to resign his seat next
year, be appointed to
the Upper House, and
take the Presidency of the
Legislative Council after
Palmer is pensioned off.
In Q. the President of
the 1 Council is ap-
pointed, and may be re-
moved, by the Governor.
It is commonly supposed
that the President of the
Q. Leg. Council is, neces-
sarily, Acting-Governor,
but in March, 1893, a
commission was issued,
appointing Palmer Lieu-
tenant-Governor. So the
bullocky old man would
continue to reign atGovt.
House in Lamington’s
absence, even though he
vacated the Council’s
chair. But Palmer is a
poor man now, and the
presidential salary of
£lOOO a year is a very
important matter to him.
The Victorians are a good deal worried
about the insane arrangement of the railway which
has its terminus on the Murray at Cobram. Some
intelligent Government made the railway terminus
at Cobram where there is no bridge, and then it
built a bridge at Tocumwal, nine miles away,
where there is no railway. And it didn’t even
make a road between the two places, freight
going per tired bullock across a deep black-soil
plain covered with crab-holes. For which reasons
much of the language in these parts is quite un-
publishable.
In a Cue (Westralia) Sessions case lately
one of the jurors was actually also a witness.
And, after he had given his evidence, he got back
into the jury-box to well and truly hold the scales
of justice between the side he was swearing fop
and the side that was swearing against him.
The Brisbane Defence Force was asked
recently for the loan of a gun-carriage, as an
ornament to a military funeral. Reply : “ Horses
turned out to grass, and can’t possibly be avail-
able in time ” —then two days ahead. If these
horses are out at grass when the invasion
comes
The Victorian Old Age Pension Commis-
sion strongly recommends, among other things,
the establishment of a State Life Assurance
system. Even the hardest lying on the part of
one or two Tory papers can’t disguise the fact that
State Life Assurance has been a great success in
Maoriland, and the idea keeps spreading.
Now that Graham Berry has been
“ honored ” with a shabby little Government an-
nuity, the Liberals of Victoria are invited to raise
a Longmore Memorial Fund for the benefit of an-
other waning warrior. Longmore is 71 now, and
not too affluent. He and Berry are the two lone
survivors of the MacPherson Cabinet of ’69.
Russell, M.H.R., on the Maoriland Old
Age Pensions Bill : “Theimprovident poor should
not be encouraged. I knew one man who spent
.£63 in one drunken bout. Ward, M.H.R. :
“ What greater argument could you have in favor
of giving pensions, to the improvident ? That man
contributed about £45 to the revenue in one act.”J
A big fight is impending between the Ass.
crowd and Labor-party for the seat in S. Adelaide
rendered vacant by “ M'Pherson’s death. The
Labor nominee will be either Kirkpatrick, ex-
M.L.C., or Hutchison, both able men. The
latter was a fellow-apprentice of M‘Pherson’s in
England 20 years ago. The Tory nominee will
probably be ex-Mayor Shaw, of Adelaide, part-
proprietor of the famous Londonderry mine.
B. R. Wise is telling all over again in the
papers how Reid was elected leader of the Foreign-
shoddy party mainly because M’Millan, Bruce
Smith, and Sunday Brunker refused the position,
and only after it had been offered to Wise himself
and declined. Which mainly goes to show that
some men don’t know how to grab at the skirts of
opportunity when it comes along. No one would
dream of offering Sunday Brunker the leadership
now, and Ashton has succeeded to Wise’s place as
the rising hope of the Free-raid party, and Wise
himself is fast becoming only a soured elderly
young man with a grievance which he ventilates
in the papers.
“TO THE PUREETC.
PARSON (entering library): “Have you ‘ Moths’—by Ouida, I think it
is? My daughters are earnest students of entomology and
would dearly prize such a work."
Zeal (Meib.), M.L.C., on the referendum:
“Itis a most pernicious measure. It is calculated
to sweep away the Legislative Council.” The
metropolitan sewage system is also pernicious—it
is calculated to sweep away typhoid. Somehow
the writer is reminded by Zeal’s lucid remark of
an old Smeaton miner he once knew. The miner
had a large, purple wen on the summit of his
head, and was advised to go to Creswick hospital
and have it yanked off. He demurred ;he didn’t
want that wen off. Asked wh,y, he replied
surlily, “ Well, ye see, I’ve had it so long !”
A HINT TO TOBACCONISTS.
Queensland Assembly wound up the 1897
session without any passing compliments. Last
year, Keogh, as the youngest member, delivered
the usual valedictory oration about the beauty
and honesty and noble character of everybody,
and the deep debt of gratitude which the country
owed them, and so on. This year there were only
grunts.
According to G. ex-Republican Dibbs :
“ We can no more do without English capital than
we can do without air to breathe or water to
drink.” Well. England waded in and made her
own capital, and if this country can’t do likewise,
and is going to lie down helplessly all its days
calling on Bull for assistance, it had better be
obliterated.
Q. Home Secretary Tozer :
A Minister of the Crown has no time to wade through
the Gazette. I have not read it for seven years, and I
do not want to read it for seven more.
Query : If Ministers don’t read and don’t want to
read the Gazette, and Horace Tozer, as in this
case, doesn’t even know the things that appear
in it over his own signature, how does he expect
the public to be enlightened by it ?
Postmaster-General Duffy (Vic.) the other
day asked Parliament for power to stop letters
addressed to sweep-promoters outside the pro-
vince, and for a general authority to open letters
—anybody’s letters —when they were supposed, or
were said to be supposed, to be connected with
gambling business, or other illegal business, or
with practically any business at all. The idea
didn’t come off, but the mere proposal shows that
the Sabbath snuffle crowd is still a power in Vic-
toria.
Pinnock, Brisbane police-magistrate, is re-
ported as having recently told a vagrant that “ no
man need be out of employment in Brisbane. If
you don’t get work within a week I’ll give you
six months.” That callous remark, if Pinnock
was correctly reported, helps to justify any decent
Government in shunting the awful old man off the
bench. If Pinnock would disguise himself and
walk round under the name of Smith looking for
work for one week, and getting nothing but abuse
and dog-bites, he would perhaps go a little slower.
Slab of jubilee gush by Colonel Building-
Society Templeton, at the banquet given to the
Bisley rifle-team in Melbourne—the howl of a
strong liquidator in his poetical agony !
And when we gathered in St. Paul’s Churchyard and
heard the Old Hundredth rise in the air it seemed to be
the culminating point—the grand fortissimo of a cres-
cendo that had started in the far east, gathered in
strength and volume in our own Australia, and swept
over India, and up to the very feet of our Sovereign
Queen. And as we turned to sleep that night we knew
the last echoes of that hymn were dying away on the
prairies in the Far West of Canada, leaving an atmo-
sphere of j'oy and sweetness encircling the whole world
round.
Ricardo: “ Graham Berry’s jingoistic ac-
tion in regard to the New Hebrides, when Agent-
General, endeared him for ever to the hearts of
two of the most strenuous advocates of his pension
—Service, inside Parliament, and Harper, now
outside. It is understood, in such diplomatic
circles as we have, that Berry saved the New
Hebrides when Salisbury wanted to hand them
over to the French. And the New Hebrides are
as Scotch as the old ones. Service and Harper,
with the help of Rentoul, are running them
financially on strict Calvin and whisky lines, in
opposition to the blighted school of the renegade
Higginson.
Apparently Drake, of Queensland, was
only babbling through his hat when he tabled his
famous motion for a State grant to the allegedly
penniless and bedridden MCI wraith. On the face
of things, it was a challenge to Nelson to prove
that his old colleague was really in distress, but
Drake, as usual, hadn’t the courage of his opinions.
Premier Nelson offered to put the motion at the
head of the notice-paper “if the hon. member
asks me to do it,” and thus give Drake every
chance of denouncing MClwraith as a fraud and
a malingerer. But “the hon. member” didn’t
ask him to do it, and the matter dropped. Every-
thing drops more or less in Queensland.
I
Q- Govt ' has im P oBed a border-tax of
~ 2 a ton on wool in order to prevent Q. wool
from finding its ocean outlet at Sydney. But the
tax prevents very little. The south-western wool-
growers take their wool to Mungindi, pay the
border-tax there, and cart it to Moree (N.S W )
rather than attempt to carry it to Yeulba, on
the Q. rad way. The road to the latter place is so
awful that a round trip from any of the stations
concerned to Yeulba and back would take two
months at the best of times (and can’t be done for
any money just now ; teams would perish), while
the journey to Moree and back can be done
within 14 days.
Murphy, M.L.A. for Warrenheip (Vic.)
has long craved for a railway from Bungaree
Junction (in his own electorate, of course) to the
local racecourse. The Government refused on the
ground that the line would cost £3500 ; it would
only be used two days in the year, and the esti-
mated revenue was just £75 per annum. But, all
the same in the early morning, after a late
sitting, when there were 37 people in the House—
a moderately full attendance—the second reading
ot the Bill authorising Bungaree railway—where
the tram is to run twice a year—was carried by a
majority of seven. The fine old boomers, Gillies,
M In tyre, O Loghlen and co., who always vote
tor borrowing the money and building every rail-
way everywhere immediately, were with the
majority, while the Ministry cursed vainly in the
rear.
In Maoriland just now the Tory organs
that Robert Stout shall throw up the last
remnants of his old Liberalism and take Russell’s
place as Opposition leader, while at least one
Liberal organ (the Canterbury Times) suggests
that Stout shall go back to his old faith and
succeed Seddon as Liberal Premier. Why Stout
should be in such urgent demand is difficult to
understand. A.s Grey’s Attorney-General he did
nothing in particular, and as Premier he was the
head of a slipshod Government which was chiefly
notable for its ruinous deficiencies. Stout, like
Drake in Queensland and Deakin in Victoria,
acquired his reputation for ability mainly through
his oratory, and like them he is one of the etern-
ally coming men who never come. And the
coming man who has been coming ever since he
was 30 and hasn’t arrived at 53 is none too pro-
mising.
“A HIGHLAND FLING."
The Canterbury Times (Christchurch,
M.L.), a paper which has hitherto been a consis-
tent supporter of the Seddon Government, sug-
gests that Premier Seddon should go to England,
or, perhaps, be honorably kicked there, as Agent-
General ; and that Robert Stout, the hairless
teetotaller of the awful Midland Railway scandal
days, shall turn democrat again, and abjure his
new Tory friends, and become a respectable mem-
ber of political society, and the country shall for-
get what a ghastly failure he used to be as Premier
and give him another trial in that capacity. The
same paper proposes also, that Agent-General
Reeves shall come back from England and become
a member of the Stout Democratic Cabinet; and
that ex-Treasurer .Joseph Ward shall be white-
washed and made Treasurer again ; and that the
Left Wing of the Liberal party —the section which
has partially quitted the Ministry by reason of
Seddon’s autocratic methods, and which partially
straggles after Stout—shall come back to its
allegiance, and that the re-united party shall
follow Stout as it used to do Ballance. Which is
much the same as suggesting that Stout shall be
ground up in the mills of the gods and made young
again, that the old pot which was broken
shall bef "he whole once more and not be at all
weak st* '~He joint.

, When an Australian team is making a lengthy
aggravated stand against Stoddart’s trundlers, and
A BO . I ', starts sending down that famous break-ball
i V. ands on the off stump and finishes abruptly
, . Violently on the button of the batstnan’s diaphragm,
jet. the assaulted, after resuscitation, be chaste and re-
?" ec J’ a V ce P T t the bowler’s apologies with grace, and thus
the Lancashire lads a lesson in humility,” writes
iiiE bulletin’s London correspondent. “In the match
surrey v. Lancashire, which virtually decided the cham-
pionship, and left Surrey on top, Tom bowled with such
aeamy inaccuracy as to break Sugg's finger, stretch
MacLaren batless on the turf, and send Johnny Briggs
dancing about on one foot nursing a bruised kneecap.
el " ln their distress goeth T.R. on each occasion
with sorrow writ large on his face, and poureth forth his
tribulation in words. Sugg, in an angel’s whisper, re-
phed, Sorry be conglomerated ! you hyphenated
Diank . and the other two poured out hyphens and
blanks also.” ‘

Adelaide cricketers don’t enthuse about Giffen
as much as those who are farther away. He is in wretched
batting form, and only bowling fairly. The writer would
prefer to see Noble in the team in Melb. on present form,
but Giffen might possibly be valuable on his own Adelaide
wicket in the third test-match.
* * * *
After taking Billowell over to Melbourne, ’twas
hard lines that he was not played v. Victoria, as now his
chance of being included in the test, which begins to-day,
is ml. Bill is in first-rafe form, and his bowling is much
respected and feared by a majority of the English players.
\Vnen the third test has been played and lost, it will sud-
denly be discovered that Billowell can still bowl. What
a farce cricket has become, when kissing goes by favor.
No pals—no place !
* * * *
The papers are now working up an agony over
an operation to be performed upon Ranjitsinhji’s tonsils.
If it is the removal of them, it is scarcely worth calling an
operation. The writer’s boy, 13 years of age, had his re-
moved a few weeks ago. He was promised half-a-crown
for the trick, but, upon sitting in the operating-chair,
said it was worth half-a-caser a tonsil, which was duly
promised. The doctor, after injecting cocaine, caught
hold of a tonsil with,a pair of pincers and snipped it off,
ditto the other ; the youngster received his five bob, and
there the matter ended.
* » * «
Writes X. : “ George Giffen now declines to
play on any terms in the second Test-match, as he has
not had sufficient time to practise, and is submitting an
offer for the third match. Giffen has taken a correct
stand, for it really looks as if the Australian cricketing
authorities, so long as they can collect a colossal revenue
with a Ranjifsinjhi, care mighty little as to how the
matches go. Sydney ground has been spoilt as a cricket-
field, both for players and onlookers, bj y the revenue-pro-
ducing cycle-track. Every effort should be made to win
these test-matches, even if the whole revenue derived be
expended in the attempt. Sydney' ground is now more
than half taken up with grand-stands, and a rest must
now be taken in that direction, or the crowd at a shilling
a head will have to take up its position outside the
fence.”
* * * »
One of many inane yarns re Ranji credits that
unthroned alleged highness with having undertaken to
give £5O to the “ Australian charities” the first time he
was clean-bowled in this country. Ranji has no £5O
notes to fling anyway. He’s not even a prince
when he gets to India, and lie has no revenue whatever
“on his own.” Ranji now is only a brown Pretender in
very modest circumstances, and he doesn’t even pretend
to the throne in a very active way. Also, it is hardly
large enough to be called a throne.
* • * «
Cricket runs in families. Witness the Trotts,
Trumbles, Graces, and Giffens. In Adelaide four Hills
play for one electorate club. Recently A. Hill made
149, F. Hill 68, and H. Hill 22 (not out). They are all
brothers of the great Clem, and their father was a famous
old-time Adelaide cricketer.
* * * *
Mentioned in cricket circles that a very aggres-
sive animosity exists between a well-known Australian
bowler and a member of Stoddart’s team. Both parties
are alleged to have told friends in strict confidence that
something sudden will happen to the other fellow w hen
they meet. The question is now, supposing they do meet
under favorable conditions, which fellow will the sud-
denest thing happen to ?
* * * *
The sweet girl scholars at the Presbyterian
Ladies’ College, Melbourne, have a cricket-club and prac-
tise regularly in shortened skirts and with a great excess
of pads, gloves, and other safety appliances. The vulgar
multitude'is rigorously denied a glimpse of the girls at
play on account of the superfluity of ankle in the busi-
ness, but a few pawky elders who know as much about
cricket as a mole knows of the Copernican theory stand
round giving advice. The girls are being taught cricket
because it is so English, you know, and no people are so
beastly English as the Scotch nowadays.
* • * •
The V.R.C., being about .£50,000 better off than
it was five years ago, will probably make a widespread
increase in its racing stakes for the coming year, rather
than add a huge lump of surplus to the Melbourne Cup
attraction and overlook all the minor handicaps. Pro-
bably any improvement of big events will be in the
way of swelling the prizes for second and third place
runners, a reform that would naturally make for honest
sport. And honest sport is what the Y.R.C.—like every
other Australian racing club—wants badly, very badly.
Adelaide racecourse presented an unusual sight
on Dec. 18, the first race-day after the passing of King-
ston’s Gaming Act. Bookies and tote-men fought shy of
the meeting, saving Carr, the leading Adelaide penoillor,
who attempted to dodge the new law by receiving invest-
ments and paying full dividends without commission.
Apparently the Act doesn’t reach Carr, but where the
latter’s profits come in is a mystery at present, as the
fractions over and above divs. are very small. The
absence of bookies and commission-agents increased the
tote-receipts of the club by £2OOO as compared with last
year. A ss. machine was worked for the first time at
this meeting. The 6s. tote is the last straw for Cohen;
it really looks as if the pelican-beaked race will have to
start in the General Debility business, or get into Parlia-
ment, or do something for a crust.
* • * *
Randwick brought together a proper Sydney
holiday attendance on Monday last for the A.J.C. Summer
meeting. Sammy Brass was the first fancied for the
hurdle race, but ere the flag fell the crowd discovered
Hereford, who was making his maiden efforts over
hurdles, and Mr. M‘Grath’s horse was backed down to
6to 2. Sammy Brass fell at the very first hurdle, and
Hereford won as he liked from Crysalite. For the Villiers
Stakes, Loch Marie was favorite at the short price of
3 to 1, but the public, recollecting Whakawatea’s
recent return to brilliance, backed him heavily, not-
withstanding the old horse’s 71b. penalty. Loch
Marie won in a canter, and the unmentioned Mecca
behind her. Half-a-dozen two-year-olds turned out for
the December Stakes, Essex and Lucky Boy being most
fancied. The winner turned up in Picture, who started
at 10 to 1, the two favorites finishing last. Phillip was the
first horse rushed by the public for the Summer Cup,
but so soon as it was seen Kelso meant backing his horse
in earnest, a rush was made for Tornado, and he had first
call at 6to 1. Tornado won by a bare head from Old Clo’,
who again ran a great mare. Spark, a bay gelding by
Antseus from Mondaine, won the Nursery Handicap ; and
Australian, starting at the nice price of 10 to 1, won the
A.J.C. Handicap from the favorite, Sayles. The Kelso
stable had a great day out, winning no less than three
events out of the six on the programme.
• • * *
At Randwick, on Boxing Day, loud and deep
were the execrations of thousands at the withdrawal of
several very popular and well-backed candidates for
Villiers and Summer Cup. It is high time the various
authorities passed a drastic law repressing these tactics.
If a horse be not scratched for a race 48 hours before
noon of day of race that horse should be deemed a
starter—barring the sudden death of the animal and a reli-
able medical certificate of his decease, or some equally
strong reason for his eleventh-hour withdrawal.
» * * *
At Randwick on Boxing Day the flat and
Leger were peculiarly free from balancers and spielers,
and the new registration rules answered well. Perhaps
now there is no better-managed course in the world than
Randwick ; but, to perfect matters, cannot the A.J.C.
executive just manage to issue 3d. or 6d. race-cards to
suit the pockets of the thousands who won’t run to a
“ bob ” for the elaborate race-book ?

The defeat of the handsome little Essex in the
rich December Stakes is difficult to account for. It will
probably not be long before he will prove that the form
was all wrong by beating all the animals that finished in
front of him.

Tatt.’s meeting commences to-day (Sat.), at
Randwick, and concludes on Monday. Sweeps on the
two principal events are bound to ensure big fields. The
Carrington sprint may fall to Precaution or El Norte (if
started in preference to Astronomer), whilst Tatt.’s Cup
seems a fair thing for Coil, next to whom may come
Voyou and Bonafide.

Tornado (Cadogan [imp.]—Avalanche), the
winner of the Summer Cup, was bred in Queensland, and
put up a good performance there when he dead-heated
for Brisbane Cup in 3.34 J. Like that rare old ex-Queens-
lander, Battalion, he seems to improve with age, and will
assuredly be heard of again shortly.

“ In the Cambridgeshire, Maluma was never
seen in the fighting van after the last 200vds. were entered
upon,” writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent.
“ At the finish she ran through beaten horses and was
sixth. The first six were in order, English, two Ameri-
cans, English, Irish and Australian horses, and a head
only separated the leading four. None of the six carried
over 7st. 31b., and the pace from the jump killed the
heavy guns. Comfrey at 25 to 1 was a very nice win for
111. Lon. News Ingrain on his 50th birthday—and the
‘ books.’ Joe Thompson made a * tremendous’ book, and
was a big winner. This was the first of the four chief
autumn handicaps to be won by an English horse. ‘ln
respect for her late husband ’ Mrs. Langtry was absent,
and there was really no genuine sign of the stable-money
being on Maluma.”

Bill Martin made a meteoric descent upon
Adelaide recently with alarming results. All the cycling
officials, who regard Bill as worse than the Evil One,
immediately sought refuge in back alleys and other un-
likely places, and a detective was put on to follow
William on a bicycle. Bill was in fair form, and it was a
sight for the gods to see the ’Murkan cutting out a fast
mile with a fat, perspiring detective in the dim distance.
Then it turned out that the Plugger was over on business
re a mere libel-action and not on any bloodthirsty wallop
bent, so everyone breathed again.

Cycling has developed a form of sweating beside
which the yoking of human beings to ploughs was com-
paratively humane. Some enterprising individual hav-
ing invented a cycle delivery dray, niggardly firms deal-
ing in small articles are doing away with their horses,
carts and drivers and, instead, hire some unfortunate
who, for a few shillings a week, has to plug round with a
cumbrous combination of a tricycle and a delivery van,
weighing 2cwt. or more, over suburban hills and against
head winds and all sorts of weather. Many of these
machines, for the sake of cheapness, are fitted with solid
tyres. So far, they are only used by firms dealing in com-
paratively light goods, but the machine is eheap and the
miserable human plugger is oheap also, so the practice is
sure to spread.

Three “scorchers” got off scot-free in Melb.
police-court the other day, because Nicholson, P.M., did
not think the constables had “fitted themselves for the
position of taking the rate of speed, and of judging dis-
tances." In the case of a solicitor, the constable “ saw
defendant pass a tram (travelling, according to a tram
official, at 12 miles an hour) about 400 yards off, and
when he reached witness he was 200 yards ahead of it.”
Defendant pointed out that if that were true he must
have been riding 24 miles an hour. Constable: “ No,
you were riding about 16 miles an hour.” The bench
advised the police to go and “ measure off distances and
practise judging them, and not to be discouraged.” If
there is any decent show of a conviction ahead the force
will probably struggle against all the discouragement that
comes in its way.

Melb. Herald asks Parliament to decree that
every bike shall carry an apparatus which will give

Swan, who gave Adelaide Advertiser the para-
graph out of which Bilmartin obtained £5O damages
(the costs of the paper being £lOO more), stuck to his
story in court to such an extent that he has now been
committed for trial for perjury. Said story was to the
effect that Bilmartin and another man had a very willing
scrap in a retired corner, and that the Plugger was
banged into a state of ridiculous wreck.

The fiasco which the grass-track falls made of
the last Austral has stirred up the League of Vic. Wheel-
men. A committee has been appointed to “take evi-
dence as to the safety or otherwise of the M.C.C. Ground
as a cycling track,’’ and on the report submitted will de-
pend whether or not the league will sanction future Aus-
trals there. Presumably some of the riders who fell dur-
ing the two Austral days will be called to give evidence.

It was officially announced at the last meeting
of the Vic. League of Wheelmen that its net credit
balance was only £546 2s. 5d., exclusive of furniture and
such. One member advised caution in order to avoid
insolvency, and the expenditure of £BO on finger-posts
was, among other things, “ deferred.”

J. G. Ward, of M.L. Parliament, has drafted a

Beyond providing some casual hanger-on of
the game with a free trip ’Ome to dear hold Hingland as
manager, the sending of an Australian team of athletes
to the other end of the world can serve no useful or sen-
sible purpose. In the first place, it would be almost im-
possible to get a representative crowd ; in the next, even
the best team would be donkey-licked. The Maorilanders
who went on a similar errand, a few years ago, fared
badly, and, certainly, Hempton and co. were far
superior to any combination that could now be raked
together here. Barring Roseingrave in the long jump,
not one of the proposed lot would score, and it is doubt-
ful whether an attack of fever, some time ago, has not
left the usual after-effect on Roseingrave.

On the eve of the races of a W.A. town, re-
cently, an imported gaby, having bought a particular
horse’s chance in a Calcutta sweep, hastened off to the
owner’s place with about 10ft. of rope, and requested the
stable-boy to hand over the moke forthwith, “because
I’ve just bought him for £2. 10s.” Stable-boy—after re-
covering his breath —“ Oh, orl right. The boss is just
goin’ to put ’im in the dray to cart the milk to the lunatic
asylum- an’ I dessay ’e’ll give yer a lift. ”

John L. Sullivan is now a white-haired man
with a shaven upper lip and elderly mutton-chop whiskers,
and his only ambition is to settle down into a municipal
billet. To which end he has encased his bull neck in a
tall collar of the most respectable shape, and he probably
refrains from drinking whisky-hot before luncheon.
When Jonel came to Australia with a dramatic show he
was a “ whale ” for whisky-hot before luncheon.

The English Amateur Rowing Association has
liberalised to the infinitesimal extent of deciding that a
boat builder is not necessarily a pro. If, however, he
builds or lets boats for “ money or wages,” he is barred
along with the common manual laborer, which term is
understood to include the counterjumper, the tailor, and
the man who rows with bare arms. Still, it isn’t Austra-
lia’s place to poke borak when its own shamateurs decide
that professional cyclists and axemen are not amateur
oarsmen, whilst professional yachtsmen and pigeon-shots
(and pigeon-shooting is, perhaps, the cronkest and most
debasing of all sports) are to be welcomed with open arms.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is equally bene-
ficial as a remedy for catarrh, rheu-
matism, and rheumatic gout. As a
Tonic, it assists the process of
digestion, stimulates the sluggish
liver, strengthens the nerves, and
builds up the body when debilitated
by excessive fatigue or wasting
illness. Physicians everywhere con-
sider Ayer’s Sarsaparilla the best. It
is a skilfully-prepared combination
of the most powerful alteratives and
tonics. No other blood-purifier gives
equal satisfaction or is so universally
in demand.

Napoleon’s opinion of an editor (as given
by Doyle): “An editor ! wliat is he ? A dirty
man with a pen in a back office. And he will
talk like one of the great Powers of Europe.”

Dr. Betz, of Heilbronn, finds that acne
rosacea (red nose and cheekbones due to drink)
fades right away, if the patches be well rubbed
night and morning with oil of turpentine. So
says the Journal des Praticiens.
North Otago Times (Oamaru, M.L.),
reporting a local function, remarks :—“ Several of
the names in the foregoing list have been
omitted.” Which is about as beautiful as that
historical Irishism : “ I hit him once and missed
him ; then I hit him again in the same place.”
A W.A. teamster agreed to take prospec-
tors out to a new find for so much a head, and with
each lcwt. of baggage. On the day fixed for
starting, each man's lot was weighed and packed
up, but it so happened that the team did not start
till next morning, and the load was found to have
grown considerably during the night. At the end
of the journey, the teamster pulled up at the local
store and borrowed the scales. “ Now,” said he,
“each man weigh bis hundred; anything over,
he’ll have to pay me Is. a pound for or forfeit.”
And, as most of the passengers were hard-up, that
carter had about two tons of provisions for sale
cheap.
A “Sailor Man ” :
There was lately an Italian barque at a wharf in an
Australian metropolis, from whence proceeded so sicken-
ing an odor of bilge-water that anyone who went near her
could easily be seasick on land. It was glorious to see
her crew at their mid-day meal on deck. The cook
brought out the lobscouse, or whatever it might be, in a
big bowl, and the men squatted around anyhow, and
helped themselves promiscuously with each other’s slob-
bered sheath-knife, or spoon, or other utensil. On the
day before her departure the cook braced himself up for
his annual wash —and performed his ablutions in the
mess-bowl. Just as he was dressing the dinner-hour
struck, and the men came trooping forward for their grub.
Cook ran to the side with the bowl, pitched out the slops,
and, ten seconds later, had the feast before them in his
late washing-tub.
Some gruesome speculations :
Sydney pawn-shop windows are full of second-hand
teeth—some from the dead, no doubt, others from the
living. In the latter case hope must be far from the
breast when people conclude that, as they have nothing
for the teeth to do, they may as well pawn them and
take a drink. But who buys them ? Like the opera-
glasses, violins, revolvers and concertinas, always on view
in pawn-shops, they seem to be put there for ornament,
as no one ever seems to want any. It is said they are
worked up by dentists into new sets. If so, it must be
consoling to the millionaire who has a false set to reflect,
when he is getting in his fine work on turkey and trufrles,
that the very same grinders he is using on such dainties
once watered at the smell of a hot saveloy, or gnawed a
chop-bone at “the eight o’clock rush.” And how the
lover must enjoy a kiss from the lips of his Potts Point
darling whose new set may have been bathed in the gin-
and-cloves loved by their former ow ner—the pride of the
Chow’s harem ; or they may be the same ivories that
have been alternately lipped and bashed by the “bloke”
when she wouldn’t give him up all of her sinful earnings.
They are, indeed, false teeth.

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS of
Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

Please mention this paper when writing
Melb. : “ A Japanese laundry just opened
in Prahran. First I have heard of in Melbourne.”
“ The German surgeon considers that
woman comes from the hand of God with super-
fluous mechanism.”— French one.
Viator: “St. Patrick’s, Melb., though
bolder, and infinitely, more effective in situation,
recalls Canterbury Cathedral more than any other.
The front tower stumps make one think of Notre
Dame, which is also to have its spire in some in-
definable future age when the Virgin shall trample
the Goddess of Reason under foot.”
Dear Bulletin, —How’s this for a bit of
solid butting: My uncle (living near Hamley
Bridge, S.A.) owns some half-dozen pet sheep and
a crossbred merino ram, usually called “ Billy.”
Not having a rival in the neighborhood to try
conclusions with, Billy attacked an English
waggon in the shed, and drove the hind part 2ft.
out of the straight line. The waggon then became
locked against the front wheel, and I suppose
Billy thought he’d had enough of it. The nave of
the hind wheel, which was the part assaulted, bore
marks as if it had been struck with a sledge-
hammer. The waggon weighs 18cwt. Billy is all
right.—W.O.R.
R. : “ All over Australia an idea exists
that human fat has special medicinal virtues,
giving extra strength, extra fighting power, extra
resistance to disease, and the like. Apropos hereof
a quotation from the Practitioner (p. 505-6,
Nov. 1897) may come in. ‘ Human fat was also
in demand for embrocations to be applied in
rheumatism. This appears to have been one of
the perquisites of the hangman, who doubtless
made a good profit out of it. At any rate the
commercial value of the article was sufficiently
great to make it worth while to produce artificial
imitations of it. Pomet says—' Everyone knows
in Paris that the public executioner sells it, the
druggists and apothecaries a little; nevertheless
they vend a sort of it prepared with aromatic
herbs, and which is without comparison better
than that which comes from the hands of the
hangman.’ The trade in human fat continued at
least till the middle of the eighteenth century.
In the Universal Spectator and Weekly
Journal of May 20th, 1732, is a reference to the
case of a man imprisoned for plundering dead
bodies of their fat.”
“ Fatman ” sends The Bulletin a neat
and genial little rhyme :
I love the noble working-man
Who slaves so hard for littl? pelf,
Yet always has a private shelf
Whereon he keeps his boozing-can.
I dearly love the rabid ghost,
The honest, ’earty, ’orney-’and,
Who has an awful down on “ land,” j
But hates the sisrht of water most.
I love the humble, simple son
Of toil, who, in domestic life,
Prefers to jump upon his wife
To any other kind of fun.
I love the poor, down-trodden lout,
Who never gets a chance to speak,
Jest ’cos of that there wealthy clique,
Yet’s always sponging for a “ shout."
« love the grimy Democrat
Who always yahs at propertee
As so much “ dirt,” what time that he
Has half the earth beneath his hat.
I’m always longinc to embrace
The cove who, when you can’t agree
With him, just curses loud and free,
And spits tobacco in your face.
And when at certain times I find
I’ve got to take his hand and shake it,
It always makes me feel inclined
To fall upon his neck and—break it.

A Wimmera paper tells the following
story:—
“ Up in prohibition Mildura, before the introduction of
the club system, and when it was really hard to get a
liquor, an enterprising barber opened shop. His charges
were fixed at shaving 9d., haircutting Is. with a glass of
strong thrown in. He would give a customer any
drink i. . :o whisky. The scheme caught on
splendidly. Visitors marvelled, and used to remark what
a clean shaven place Mildura was. The community soon
began to look as if it had been struck bald-headed.
Strangers not in the know used to-wonder why a man
got his hair out half a dozen times a day, or almost had
the skin shaved off his face. Rechabites took to wearing
beards, and letting their hair grow long. If one was seen
with a close crop, or newly shaven, scoffers would ask
him if it had been ‘wine crop,’ or ‘whisky shave.’ But
Mildura knows that barber no more. The clubs simply
ruined him, for the people can now get liquor ad lib
without having their hair cut every time.

Suffield is still in his living grave, and the

with all its feet to make him fit that grave.
Suffield is a victim not only of Windeyerism, but
of Government by Contradiction. Both N.S.W.
political gangs, the ins and the outs, are interested
in justifying the actions of their respective Minis-
ters of Justice. A pamphlet fully dealing with
this monstrous wrong has just been published.

Dr. Stephen H. Emmens, the Yankee
chemist, who invented the explosive, “emmen-
ite,” adopted by the U.S. for coast defence, now
claims to have found how to make gold out of
silver. Says he has sold an ingot of it to the
“Bureau of Assays” for coining purposes. He
keeps his secret for the present, except to state
that by a chemical treatment of the silver he pro-
duces an intermediary metal, “ argentaurum,”
then by a further treatment he obtains the gold.
One drawback about it at present is that the arti-
ficial gold is so expensive that, like the diamond,
it can only be manfactured at a slight loss.

LA6ER B€€R.
The Family Skeleton.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a carriage by the gateway, there’s a flun-
key at the door,
There’s another cooing softly to the satin-coated
bays ;
There’s “an architectural poem,” as the papers
said before,
When I built my swagger villa in the boasting,
booming days.
On the lawn a leaping naiad holds a fountain to
the sky ;
There are marbles made to order in Genoa years
ago,
And my wife goes down the terrace in the best
that gold can buy
To complete the striking tableau—meaning
Somerville and 00.
Neatly tailored, smartly hatted, step up Somer-
ville and Co.
Fourteen stone, five-foot-eleven, sound of limb,
as good as new ;
Rich as Croesus, so they tell me, when my wines
unstinted flow,
And the eyes of envy stab me in the market and
the pew.
Silk hats rev’rently salute me, doing homage mete
to cash,
And the rose-leaf lips of maidens smile a greet-
ing sweet to see,
For I hold the whip securely, and the world spins
n’eath the lash,
And a grinning, lanky goblin makes a hollow
sport of me !
Bare and bleached is he—his sapless joints like
rusted hinges creak,
And a wisp of hair clings quaintly to his bony,
hollow skull.
In my wife’s eyes lurks the terror that her lips re-
fuse to speak,
But he is my dear, damned brother, and we two
are never dull.
In our home he bides contentedly ; its beauty
pleases him —
He exults in lavish splendor, and he loves to
come and sit
On an old black carven bureau when the lamps are
burning dim, *
Making mouths for me, and mumming like a
jester from the Pit.
When the waltzers swing together, and the lips of
women glow,
And the low, glad laughter lingers ’mid the
blossom-burdened trees,
He is barred and double-bolted in his cupboard
down below,
And my girl and I look happy, and are almost
at our ease.
But I’d rather be alone with him. My den is dark
and small.
Up I take him when the guests are gone, and
give a curse to care,
For the sweet, old mellow whisky makes him
human, after all,
And we fraternise, and gaily we get drunk
together there.
One time Kate and I, to fool him (God! I love her
and forget!)
In the moaning winter evenings tried the old
home custom o’er;
Sitting snugly in the firelight, read, as ’twere a
lesson set,
But he crept up through a crevice, and he
capered on the floor.
Then the story was forgotten, and I glowered on
the flame,
Whilst she wept, crouched low in terror with
her face upon my knee.
That was long ere we were comrades, ere this
fierce abandon came,
And I knew the poignant humor of his hell-
born comedy.
Now he roams the whole house over—we alone
can see him there.
When I come at eve he answers to the summons
of the bell;
Waking strangely in the night, I hear his footstep
on the stair,
But I know he’ll never leave me, we’ll foregather
deep in hell.
I had once a child, and loved her, but her eyes
grew wild and old—
Oh, my God ! the crazy laughter of a babe ! —it
haunts me still!
But the spectre wearied shortly, and he stretched
her, white and cold,
And I blessed him and was grateful for the
mercy that could kill.
Things are rosy in the city, wondrous rumors go
the rounds
Of the clever coups that Somerville and 00.
have made of late.
We’ve just worked a little corner good for thirty
thousand pounds,
And the firm and wife are dining with the
Governor at eight.
It is sport, all sport for him, and when at last he
tires, I swear,
He will take me by the arm one day; exposed
beneath the sky
We will walk the Block together, see the blank,
white faces stare,
And, ’fore God, I cannot say who’ll laugh the
louder, he or I.
EDWARD DYSON.
The School at Sergeant's
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of all the small bush schools I ever had
the misfortune to be in charge of, I think with
least regret of the school at Sergeant’s. And this,
with other things, leads me to say that the experi-
ence of teachers does not vary so much with the
schools as the places they board at. Practically,
the schools are alike—little wooden boxes with
iron roofs—cold as Kiandra in winter and hot as
Booligal in summer. Nowadays the buildings are
even more uniform—built to style, as it were ; but
in my day the only difference was in the width of
the cracks. The children are always the same—
God forgive them ! —the results never vary ; and
the same loneliness pervades all. But the chief
difference in the place you board at is that each is
the worst. All except Sergeant’s.
* * * *
Old Sergeant was one of the finest men I
ever saw—six-feet-two at sixty-three ! A rugged
and seamed old face, clean-shaven but for a fringe
of white hair about his neck; eyes clear as a child’s;
and a mouth that expressed determination except
when he was in company and couldn’t get rid of
the superfluous saliva engendered.by his inactivity.
He was a rough old customer, with many quaint
and truthful sayings—more or less concerning
women, and more or less unprintable. But his
veneration for his wife was almost pathetic. It
showed in his speech. With a total disregard for
grammar, it was, “ When me and Tom was on
Lambing Flat,” or “ The time me and Bill Wade
was overlandin’,” but every reference to her was
“Mother and me”; and “Wasn’t it, mother?”
O omprised half of his yarns.
* * * *
The family were all married ; and, in the
long winter evenings, after my solitary tea —my
mouth waters even now at the memory of those
preserves—l would go into the kitchen and find
the old woman knitting his socks, and old Ser-
geant making picture-frames of fruit-stones and
cones. A steaming glue-pot by his side, and pliers
in his hand, he cracked the nuts and fitted the
pieces with such minute care that to cover three
square inches of frame was a long night’s work.
After a while, I drew designs for him to pick out
with different kinds of stones, and even essayed
one myself—that was picked to pieces in more
ways than one. And then, in front of the log fire,
he would tell stories of the old time, or I would
play the fiddle.
* * * *
He would never let me play my best piece
—“ Home, Sweet Home ” —because : “ When me
and Tom was on Araluen—that was before mother
and me took up, wasn’t it, mother ? we got word
that a great fiddler, called Something-Whisky, was
cornin’. There was a bit of a hall at the pub.,
and me and Tom was often there, doin’ a
bit of steppin’ and such. Me and Tom was
counted the best steppers on the diggin’s—
leastways, Tom always played,” he added, with
characteristic modesty. “ Well, Whisky took the
hall, and we all dressed up to take out our ten
bobs’ worth ; and, my word, there was a mixed
crowd there—wasn’t there, mother ? Well,
Whisky came out, and as soon as he starts we
could see he was a fine player; but there-was too
much shakes and such for us. He ran up and
down like winkin’ till big Tom M'Grath—you re
member Tom, mother?—stands up on a seat and
says : * I move Jack Sergeant does a step.’ That
was me; and before old Whisky knew where he
was I was at it. Whisky stood on one side
pattin’ his fiddle and speakin’ some language to
himself, while I gave a new step me and Tom
had been practisin’ on the quiet. Well,
of course, there was drinks; but no one re-
membered old Whisky, till he ups and
starts playin’ ‘ Home, Sweet Home,’ just plain
like. Sometimes now, when I’m lyin’ in bed, it
comes to me ; don’t it, mother? Well, you never
heard a lot of fellows cough and clear their
throats like we did. After that we cleared the
stage, and made him promise only to play plain
tunes we knew, and then we all goes out and paid
afresh to come in ; didn’t we, mother ? ”
* * * •
When the old woman died I offered to
move, but old Sergeant wouldn’t hear of it. -‘You
stay along with me and we’ll rub along—you was
a favorite of hers.” One night he selected one
from a number of tombstone photographs. and
asked me to write the inscription. He looked
over my shoulder and spelled the words as I wrote
“ Sacred to the memory of Jane the beloved wife
of— ” Then he stopped me. “ What’s wrong? *'
I asked. “ Well,” he said, “ her and I was never
properly married ; best rub out wife and put help-
mate. She was that— true—wasn’t you, mother ? ”
said the old man, dreamily.

His boots are from the Strand,
The bike which he propels with speed

He drinks a glass of Belgian gin—
Jamaica rum, perchance—
And smokes the “ best Virginia ” in
A pipe that’s “ Made in France! ”
He looks at his imported watch to see the time of
day
And hurries, for he wants to see a new, imported
play.
The lamp is “ Made in Germany ” that lights him
on his way.
He’s a patriotic, thoroughbred Australian !
He’s a patriotic, thoroughbred Australian !
And he sticks up for his country like a man !
For it’s good for growing mutton,
But it couldn’t make a button
For the trousers of a true Australi-an !
He comes up to his cottage, where
There’s lager from the Rhine,
And seats himself upon a chair
Of Austrian design !
His English hat he places on
The Chinese cheffomer,
And drinks from his Italian glass
His German lager beer !
He strikes Italian matches and he lights the
German lamp;
He sees the jam and pickles have the real im-

He tries the Dutch piano for the latest foreign

He’s a patriotic, thoroughbred Australian !

And he sticks up for his country when he can.
It’s the champion for cricket
When MTCibbin beats the wicket ;
That’s sufficient for the true Australi-an 1
The Chinese washstand in his room
Is near the Russian rug;
He fills the ’Murkan basin from
The German water-jug ;
He takes his German razor
And he shaves himself with ease }
He reaches for the towel-stand —
The latest—Japanese !
With Baris soap he washes off Australian dust
and dirt,
Puts on his Irish collar and his English under-
shirt ;
He laces up his London boots, which very seldom
hurt
A patriotic, thoroughbred Australian !
He’s a patriotic, thoroughbred Australian !
And he sticks up for his country like a man !
And he buys of all creation
But the land of his location,
He’s a thorough-going, true Austral-ian !

Another “Light That Failed.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A gaolj in Borneo ; on a syn-baked patch of clay
stood the triangles, near which were a group of
half a dozen —the doctor, the jailer, the hospital
dresser, the native warder or mandore, and his
two assistants. At the back of the group stood
the gallows, from the cross-beam of which dangled
the fraying ends of three ropes, “the trinity,” as
the Doctor sneeringly called them, from which, on
the previous day, had dangled and been cut down
the emancipated bodies of as many natives. In
front, the grim black prison wall. To the left the
women’s ward, in front of which a few unfortun-
ates strutted, in a vain endeavour to catch the
sympathy of some member of the group with
wiles they had exercised in their youth. To the
right was the gaol hospital, in front of which a
few miserable vagrants were apathetically watch-
ing a couple of good-conduct men tying up in
mats the bodies of those of their companions
whom Providence had mercifully released from
suffering.
The door of the main prison opened ; through it
came Mandore Nyam, the hangman, followed by
a dozen or so of coolies, after whom were half that
number of Pathan guards.
The corporal of the guard saluted, and he and
his men fell back ; the doctor lit his pipe; the
dressers began smearing the lint with vaseline
and iodoform, while Mandore Nyam, who had
relieved the warder of his canes, was squatting
close to the ground and cutting deep grooves in
the clay with his forceful and accurately delivered
blows. The prisoners had, meantime, stripped,
and were waiting in misery their turns. The
warder handled a bundle of warrants to the gaoler,
and the later stepped forward, and, in quick,
careless style, told the first man in the row, Suli-
man, that, having been convicted of a breach of
the Labour Ordinance, in leaving the estate on
which he worked without the manager’s permis-
sion, he had been sentenced to 50 cuts; had he
anything to say ?
Suliman, the wreck of a fine specimen of a
native, stepped out of the rank, and with his
hand to his forehead said, “ Tuan, I left the estate
to complain of my master’s treatment of me. He
overworked me till I nearly died of beri-beri, and
when too ill to work or defend myself or her, he
ruined Russina, my daughter. I could get no
hearing from anyone there, so I left the estate to
see if anyone in the town would listen. I take
my 50 strokes, if Allah spare me, willingly, if I
can but feel that my daughter’s ruin will be
avenged. Tuan, I am ready.” And Suliman
walked up to the triangles.
.“L n this pipe!” said the doctor, as he
tried again to light it.
“D n that fool of a coolie ! Just as though a
daughter of his being taken up by Sayers, was
going to get him off a flogging for clearing out to
complain, as he calls it. Ready, Doc. ? ”
“Yes, goon, Nyam.” This from the Doctor,
who, with his mouth to his pipe, and his ear to a
stethoscope, had been reckoning how many cuts
the prisoner could stand. Suliman was soon fast
to the triangles. Nyam flicked him playfully
with the end of five feet of rotan, as he planted
his feet firmly and waited for the signal. The
gaoler raised his hand ; Nyam drew back ; the
swish of the rotan through the air was followed by
a dull “ tack ” as it came with frightful force
against Suliman’s naked flesh. Suliman gave no
sign of pain, and the Mandore slowly counted
“satu.” Again was this repeated, and again till
the gaoler dropped his hand when the Mandore
counted “sapuloh.”
The Doctor reluctantly interrupted his yarn to
the gaoler, and cast a look towards Suliman.
“ Go on,” he said, as he resumed his yarn.
Again the Mandore said “ talli,” and the gaoler
noted twenty on the back of the warrant.
A nod from the Doctor started Nyam on his
third ten. The first cut drew blood, but no sound
came from Suliman.
“ Dua,’’ said the Mandore aloud, and an atten-
tive listener might have heard a faint moan from
the poor man’s lips, mingling with a snigger from
the Doctor, as he recounted some scandal which
had come to his professional ears.
“ ‘ Ampat; ’ ‘ lima ; ’ ‘ anam; ’ ” and the moans
grew more pronounced; “ ‘tujoh ; ’ ‘delapan;
‘simbilan;’ ‘sapulah;’ that is thirty,” said the
Mandore. The quivering, bleeding, length of
emancipation gave one piteous glance towards the
Doctor, who merely signed with the stem of his
pipe to go on. Again were the cuts from one to
ten, from “satu ” to “sapuloh,” monotonously re-
corded in a droning sing-song voice by the Man-
dore. Once more the Mandore awaited a sign
from the Doctor to go on. This time it was
longer coming ; the pipe would not draw. “ Might
sound him again, Doc., eh ? ” asked the gaoler,
“he begins to look bad on it.” “ Right, when
my pipe is alight,” said the Doctor, as he struck
his last match, signing at the same time for the
Mandore to go on.
“Another light that failed,” laughed he as the
action put out the match, “ the beggar can wait
till next ‘ talli ’ for stethoscoping—and, meantime,
give me a light off your cigar.”
“Satu,” counted the Mandore, “dua, tiga, am-
pat, lima,” and the moans, which had become
more and more audible, now ceased ; the Mandore
almost lost count in his vain endeavour to attract
the gaoler’s attention. That functionary was too
busy recounting to the Doctor his not too reput-
able escapade with the wife of a certain big
official, to pay attention to the moans of a coolie,
and Nyam stopped of his own accord when the
Mandore counted “sapuloh.
With a laugh at the last coarse jest, the Doctor
drew out his stethoscope and listened. “ Heart
disease,” said the Doctor. “Another light that
failed,” added the gaoler, throwing down the
stub of his cigar.
YANG ANYUT.
Age “ In Memoriam ” jingle :
We cannot clasp thy hand,
Thy faie we cannot see ;
Yet let this little token tell
We still remember thee.
Which implies that deceased still takes the Age—
asbestos edition, presumably.
Holdar M. : “ Sweet woman’s clinging
nature has been as widely commended as her
generally noble resignation in the face of adversity.
The former attribute stands good, but the latter
is doubtful. For instance : It was a wet and wail-
ing night, and a Sydney suburban bus was making
for the city. A damp, disordered crowd filled
every inside seat. The collection of twopenny
fares proceeded smoothly until one fair female was
challenged. Her contribution to the fare-box, she
admitted, was one brown ; the other brown, as she
shrilly explained to a cynical driver, had slipped
amidst the straw, whence he could afterwards
recover it. The Jehu was obdurate, but the lady
protested, and this impecunious scribe, desiring
yieace, struck matches whilst the lady searched.
The lost coin refused to appear, but a pint of rain-
water came out of the hollow crown of the lady’s
hat, and flooded the search-party. The driver
outside grew blasphemous, and objurgated in the
midst of the driving rain and the furious south
wind. One horse went down on the slippery blocks
while he was ‘driving blind’ with his mouth
down at the trap threatening battle, murder and
sudden death if the other brown wasn’t forth-
coming. The girl dissolved into tears and still
looked for her lost penny in the straw. The damp
crowd inside took the matter cynically, and only
made strong remarks about the fallen horse.
i inally that animal was got on its feet and held
up by a strong volunteer force, and then the
sodden driver came to the door and announced
that the bus wouldn’t move another step till the
copper was forthcoming. Upon which the dis-
tracted female got out a good-sized roll of notes,
and extracted a well-filled purse from underneath
the notes, and paid. The clinging nature of
woman hasn’t been over-rated in the least. For
clinging to a penny on a wet night I don’t know
her equal.”
Witnesses before Vic. Law Commission
are most unanimous when they complain of the
system that enables crown officials to charge
heavy fees for doing the work for which they are
also heavily salaried. Cases are instanced of a
judge’s associate charging six guineas for a two-
hours’ job, and the prothonotary demands two
guineas from every citizen who wants to look at
one of the documents for the care of which the
official is already paid a fine, fat screw by the
State. “ Why,” wails one witness, “ should there
be any fee paid to Government servants for doing
work that comes within the scope of their ordinary
duties?” This is so innocent that even echo is
not expected to reply, excepting with a casual
gibber of mirth. Why should a crow pick out the
eyes of the gentle jumbuck when he gets a chance 1
The Licensing Bench in Melbourne is com-
posed of Judge Molesworth, Nicholson, P.M.,
and Panton, P.M. Molesworth and Nicholson
are always in accord. Panton is always a dis-
sentient and indignant minority of one.’ In old
times in Sydney something of a similar kind was
represented by the Full Court. Judge Cheeke
always agreed with the Chief Justice, and so saved
all the bother of delivering an opinion. Fawcett
and Hargrave always disagreed with the Chief,
and took a lot of trouble to explain wherefore.
Ihe bar used to loot inexperienced juniors by
temjiting them with long odds to bet that Cheeke
would disagree. Cheeke’s “I agree with the
Chief Justice ” was as sure a principle to back
as the setting of the sun—and surer, since the sun
doesn t. set. “ Agree ! ” cried Dr. Bellinfante.
“ What an agree-able man is Judge Cheeke. If I
see him not agree once—only one e—parbleu I I die
happy.”
He was the least trifle seedy, and looked
like a British swell tourist whose fortunes had
just started on the down grade. Still they don’t
draw very tine distinctions in the seedy, dusty,
fly-infested, sere and yellow town of YVi cannia,
and when he drifted into the bar and had a drink,
and then ordered dinner, “including a bottle of
the best wine you have in the house, landlord,” he,
was served with alacrity. Having finished dinner
and an extra bottle of the wine, he sauntered on
to the verandah where the boss was walking up
and down and fighting with the flies. “ I have-
haw—had an excellent dinner, landlord ; very ex-
cellent dinner. Even the wine was not- haw—
bad for the bush. I—haw—thank you.” Then a
trifle louder : “ I regret, landlord, that I really
can’t—haw—pay you. lam stone-broke. I really
am—haw. But ” —here he turned round and
cleared his coat-tails for action—“ you may—er —
kick me if you like.” And the landlord kicked
enthusiastically without a word.

“My wife ]»••** all her life long been subject to rush of blood to the
head and fainting tits. In later years these were more frequent, and
her skin became very sallow. She had scarcely any appetite, and it was
not safe to leave her at home by herself for fear of a fainting fit. I may
state we had medical advice both in England and here in New Zealand,
but it did no good, so some months back I suggested that she take
Ayer's Sarsaparilla. She protested against it, believing, it to be quackery,
but I purchased a bottle just to give it a trial, and the result was mar-
vellous. Mrs. Moul has taken five bottles, and now she is a new creature.
My daughter has also begun to use your sarsaparilla for skin
discoloration and poor, appetite, with considerable success already.
I forward you their photo by this mail, and you can make what us©
you think proper of this statement. Yours gratefully,
John E. Moul, Ty-Coed, Swanson, Auckland, N. Z., Feb. 9,1897.
