AFRAID OF FOOD.
feufierers from indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and find
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and 1 unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s Eunser
thol Jujubes correct acidity of tlie stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent
abnormal fermentation of the food, thus allowing the natural digestive ferments to act
and if taken regularly after meals they so
improve the digestion that a strict diet be-
comes unnecessary. Hudson’s Enmenthol
Jujubes are most useful to those who suffer
from Heartburn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

The Red Page
Little Big Men
Is pettiness in human contacts one of the
unfailing marks of genius? Every now and
then some latter-day writing about the great
infects me with a sort of sick certainty that
this is so, and no sooner have I recovered
my healthy admiration of the man in his
work than I am ill again of some new scrap
of indigestible, disillusioning biography. Now 7
Richard le Gallienne’s personal and near-
personal recollections of The Romantic
' Y indies have brought: about a relapse. This
is a frank, revealing ago. The biographer of
a Byron would be more likely to give us the
sordid essence of a divorce-court co-
respondent than the glamor and color of a
Don Juan. Not that Le Gallienne’s writing
is so much to this very modern taste; as the
title suggests, it is flavored largely with the
unreasoning worship of an older day. He
tells most of his self-conscious delight, as a
young w'riter, in meeting and hearing the
Titans of the time, in being so fortunate as
to “see Shelley plain,” as he quotes it. But
a number of his sketchy memories have a
direct action on this mental illness of mine,
and might be better labelled “The Littleness
of Great Men.” And it is such childish and
intemperate littleness for the most part that
it leaves me weak and feverish again.
Take this sample of what Le Gallienne
calls “breakfast-table amenities.” It hap-
pened at the house of George Eliot’s hus-
band, George Henry Lewes. Between Tenny-
son (not yet a Lord) and Herbert Spencer
was seated Frederic Harrison, historian and
what was then thought advanced- radical
thinker. Neither of his eminent neighbors
had met Harrison before. The first amenity
—-indeed, the first w 7 ord —came from Tenny-
son, who suddenly asked, “I suppose you
know who I am?” and, having been assured
otherwise, delivered himself so: “I’m Mr.
Tennyson, and if I thought as you do I’d go
and hang myself.” Even less gracious was
Harrison’s introduction to Spencer. Having
broached so,me philosophical subject and hav-
ing “quite deferentially ventured to express
opinions that were his own but not the phi-
losopher’s,” he had tin 7 unhappiness to see
“Spencer clapping on his ear clips and be-
having as though on the verge of an epileptic
fit.” The philosopher then had to be all but
carried from the room and Harrison up-
braided for not knowing better than to con-
tradict the great man. The ear clips, avc are
assured, Were carried by Spencer “for all
conversational occasions” and constantly used
to end the discussion when any difference c.f
opinion stirred him to a like irritation, which
it inevitably did. Of the same great philo-
sopher it is_ said that he never employed the
ladies of his household for longer than six
months “for fear they should become attached
to him.” A later story of Alfred Lord Tenny-
son concerns a distinguished luncheon in
his honor, immediately prior to which he
found on his hostess’s table a volume by
Churton Collins. avlio “made a point of
tracking down Tennyson’s considerable in-
debtedness to the classics.” This so enraged
the poet that lie summoned his wife and,
without apology, left the luncheon-party
lamenting, made straight for home and took
to his bed, a sick man.
On the advice of the friend who intro-
duced the author to Ibsen, Le Gallienne was
to “tell him that all the English Avoinen adore
him. That will be enough.” This the young
writer did with the greatest success. The
mention of Ibsen’s name by Le Gallienne at
another time and place gives us this picture
of Bjorustjernc Bjornson : “He stopped short,
fire in his eyes and nostrils, and shaking his
great Avbitc mane, he thundered out, ‘lbsen !’
A pause and then again Avith withering .con-
tempt, ‘lbsen is not a man; he is only a
pen !’ ”
Of Wilde Ave have the talc of an occasion
when a friend wrote his name in the visitors’
book of a club as “O. Wilde.” “O. Wilde!”
said Oscar. “Who is O. Wilde? Nobody
knows O. AVilde; but Oscar Wilde is a house-
hold word!” We arc shown Swinburne
"breathing hard and spasmodically” as he
gave his opinion of a new poet (Francis
Thompson) with “true Swinburnian, poly-
syllabic scorn,” and .scribbling offensive re-
marks in French oil the margins of the re-
A'ieAv. Meredith we see at a moment when Le
Gallienne, recalling a promise of a page of
manuscript, has had the misfortune to say,
in his diffidence, that he expected “only a
little poem.” Writes Le Gallienne: “The
air seemed to grow still as with imminent
thunder, and then with merciless sarcasm
he let loose his lightnings upon me. ‘Oh; I
see,’ he said, turning to his fellow guests.
‘Mark you that! He Avants nothing import-
ant. Only a little poem! Hoav truly he
speaks, after all. Everyone knoAvs the un-
importance of my poor poems.... Yes!
Nothing important—only a little poem!’
So he went on while I expostulated in vain— *-
and I never got my manuscript.”
Thus it goes, incident after incident so
childish in essence, so grotesquely out of pro-
portion Avith the stature of these men, that
one is almost forced to conclude that, Avhat-
ever virtues genius may possess, it certainly
lacks the blessed, salutary one of humor.
To think of one of those great men driven
to uncontrolled fury by a pinprick of criti-
cism is to see some Brobdingnag native hop-
ping AAildly on one leg and Availing his dis-
tress to Heaven because an ant has bitten
him on the big toe. It is ludicrous ; it is
a little pathetic—and vastly human. Giants
that are-maddened by the mention of the
possibility of other giants, by the suggestion
that, there may be ether roads than their
roads, other thoughts than their thoughts,
that there may even be pygmies who have
never heard of their gianthood, make laughter
for “the gods.”
Not all, nor even the larger part, of Mr?
Le Galli<?nne’s romantic rambles end in such
disillusioning vieAvs. but these concern me
most. And, after all, there is nothing quite
so entertaining or so humanly intriguing to
our perverse nature as the unveiling of our
idol’s feet of clay: chiefly, I suspect, by
reason of the comfort it brings to the dis-
turbing sense of our own mnddiness.
A. M. HAS KN.
A Gippsland Novelist
In the early, ’seventies, travelling with a
bullocky and his team carrying stores from
Sale (Vic.) to a cattle-station homestead in
the Gippsland ranges, I passed through a
tiny settlement bearing the Scotch-sounding
name of Glenmaggie. It consisted of a store,
a bush pub (I think it was the Magpie and
Stump) and a wood-and-iron structure that
was school, church—at long intervals —'dance-
hall and general meeting-place. Thence on
till we reached the foot of the ranges, where
pack- and riding-horses awaited us, we
passed through vast aisles of magnificent
• timber; and from the backbone of the ranges
that towered before us could be seen in the
clear mountain air the white crest of Kos-
ciusko. Eater on, when once a week I rode
down the bridle-path from the track along
' the mountain-ridge to the glen for our mail,
I often halted for a few seconds before that
wonderful scene. At my feet lay a great
sea of foliage so dense that the wind passing
over it mimicked the billows of the veritable
ocean, and sighed through the branches and
leaves in haunting monotone. Here and
there a bird sounded its liote; and, carrying
clear across the distance, came the click of
the timber-gettei'’s axe. That was the Gipps-
land timber belt as it stood in almost pri-
meval solitude nearly 50 years ago. I have
never seen Glenmaggie nor those beloved
ranges since, but they tell me the little settle-
ment has grown into a township, and the
glorious timber-land is no longer a sea of
giant treetops but a chequer-board of pros-
perous holdings.
It was in this lovely .spot that Mary Ful-
lerton was born, and in her latest book—it
is a human document rather than a novel—
she brings back to me something of the'
glamor of the great forests and the Alpine-
ranges of Gippsland. She had the advantage
of being one of a large family, and in the
free and generous atmosphere of eouutry life
came to love the folk around her, their
simple ways, and, above all, the beauty of
the densely-wooded bush. In The People of
the Timber Belt (A. M. Pliilpot) she takes
us on a very welcome excursion from the
rut of Australian, fiction. Probably every
young community passes through a stage
when all its literary output tends towards
a single standard. Its limitations seem to
be so strictly set that each newcomer feels
a sort of compulsion to follow on the conven-
tional lines. We are getting old enough now
to think for ourselves, and each rebel who
breaks away from the old and outworn types
should receive a hearty welcome. And that
welcome Mary Fullerton deserves -she. de-
scribes human nature as she saw it in the
timber belt, and carries out her work With
fidelity, charity and understanding. The
story is told by a schoolmistress, and in the
telling we see the little suggestions of “primes
aiid prisms” that are a sort of veneer to a
very broad- and sympathetic nature. .Her
study of character is largely psychological,
and draws us into a network of primal pas-
sions, shot through by flashes of spiritual
fife. Here and there are passages exquisitely
descriptive of natural beauty, and one per
feet little idyll will be found in the story of
Pat and bis fairy wife.
It is a book that will not please all read-
ers. The plot, if it may be called such, does
not work to any fixed design : it simply
evolves from the natures of the folk. It is
like life in being a compound of tangles and
ends. One glimpses tragedy from afar off.
not tragedy wrought out of the stuff of cir-
cumstance, but out of the Jiving being of
the characters. Slaves of technique may
find faults in workmanship, narrow souls out
of sympathy with the lialf-religious, half-
superstitious outlook on life of simple men
and women may take a superior attitude to-
wai-ds it; but all in all Mary Fullerton has
done an excellent piece of work and gone
direct to Nature for its material. Published
in England, where the author is at present
residing, _ “The People of the Timber Belt”
has received a very favorable reception from
English reviewers. As Australian writers
do not as a rule fare too generously at the
hands of the British publie, this is good news.
T. B. C.
Passion and Compassion
“Art should never stand for passion, but
for compassion,” said Fritz Kreisler recently.
Whereupon a writer in the Melbourne
Aegtjs concludes that this is “a well-merited
rebuke to the erotic school that has; exer-
cised such an unhealthy influence of recent
years.” And so it may be; but since
Kreisler said this an article signed by him
has appeared in another paper in which he
does not baulk at the assertion that “every
true artist is consumed by a passion to
create.” In which of these utterances are
we to look for Kreisler’s real opinion?
Some deeper issue than a point in esthe-
tics is on trial here. As to the second of
these dicta, nobody, even among those of ns
who are unconsumed by passions, creative
or otherwise, would be disposed to quibble.
As to the first, it means, if anything at all,
that Burns’s “Cotter’s Saturday Night,”
Shakspeare’s “Tempest,” the last Quartets
of Beethoven and Wagner’s “Parsifal” are
masterpieces unparalleled by anything else
that their authors gave to the world—a con-
clusion that afflicts the mind with a whole
pestilence of depressing and thwarting im-
plications. For. if the notion that compassion
is the end of all true art should become a
fixed universal axiom, or if, by any contradic-
tion of terms, the creative mind should be
content to express itself dispassionately,
what —to pursue the thought no further —
what would be the fate of the Kreislers.
whose distinctive function it has been to
wring passion, and only incidentally compas-
sion, from the bowels of their fiddles?
Everyone must surely be aware that for
the creative artist compassion is passion - , and
that the deepest compassion in poetry or
music will be expressed only by him who can
express the greatest longing, the greatest joy,
the greatest ardor of grief or hate or love. A
little pathos, a little joy, a little passion—
there is the measure of mediocrity. lago

NO KNOCKING
THE most important quality
of motor spirit is its “anti-
knocking capacity. Knocking
necessitates easing the com-
pression, by retarding the
“spark,” when increased pulling
power is most needed—as when
climbing a hill—with the result
that the power capacity of
the engine is thereby reduced.
Shell Motor Spirit possesses
natural non-pinking properties
which enable the fullest use to
be made of an open throttle
and advanced spark, without
“knocking.” Try Shell out on
the hills. It has greater pulling
powe r—quicker acceleration—
and gives more miles per gallon.

DAVID JONES’
for Service ''Sydney.
and Desdemona are fruits of one stem ; and
the root that nourished them burgeoned into
a thousand diversities of passionate explo-
sion Similarly, Burns is one of the ver>
Greatest of poets because he covers a larger
area of experience and gives a more passion-
ate definition of that experience than any
other since Shakspeare. Put Marlowe and
Bvron, men of passion sans compassion, re-
spectively alongside of Shakspeare and
Burns, and they shrink to comprehensible
proportions immediately. I write as the
tiger springs,” said Byron; and if all Pace
of his poems were obliterated we should still
be able, with that single astonishing gesture
as evidence, to gauge something of the vol-
canic force of his mind. He was a pheno-
menon in nature, certainly; but by the con-
trast of Burns’s divine completeness of uttei-
ance he seems all too human. Both were
splendid fellows, noble as Romans, familiar
with the sublimest aspirations of the human
spirit. Both were seducers of women
which is regrettable or not according to your,
conception of the artist-mind. Both were
superb poets. But compare them, and note
how, by the side of the superman Byron,,
Burns 'attains the stature of a demigod.
Burns was what any man, or any super-
man,” might well wish to be. He was one
of the most magnificent beings that ever
graced the earth. That is to say. lie was the
incarnation of joy, the breath of desire,
the soul of compassion, the trumpet-mouth
of heroism, the herald of liberty, the heart of
friendship, the spirit of laughter, the be-
stower of caresses, the lover of all beauty,
the most generous, the most lovable because
the most passionate of all the poets except
Shakspeare—the eternal exception!
"Art should never stand for passion, but
for compassion.” Was ever such cant? Any
self-respecting or at least self-understanding
artist might have been expected to know that
the "moral” estimate of passion (in the more
downright sense of animalism) is simply a
shrewd necessity of convention, and that this
estimate has nothing but a social bearing on
the universal fact of animalism. That is
to say, instead of this animalism being some-
thing that must be slurred over as gracefully
as possible, as in the world of moral values,
it is to the artist the very life and essence of
the creative impulse.
This is such an old story, I marvel that
there should be any call to repeat it at this
time of day.
ADRIAN LAWLOR.
Optics and Art
Australia could do with a little healthy
heterodoxy and a few freakish vagaries in
art just now. We have climbed with a vigor
and joyous zest to an acceptable standard in
portrait painting and a realistic interpreta-
tion of Australian landscape. The impetus
set going by Condor, Tom Roberts and Stree-
ton has energised abundantly and fruitfully
for a generation, and forthright and admir-
able work has been created by the many
young brushinen who followed in their steps.
“We have painted the Australian bush, sea-
scapes and mountain-scapes, and done a dash
at portraiture. Well, what more is there to
do but amble along in the ruts marked out
for us, following the prescribed lines —carry-
ing on?” say the easy-going, happy band of
pleasant painters.
Very good, very charming! But isn't
there a danger now of becoming trite and
set, of letting accepted convention atrophy
individual effort, of ceasing to seek and
struggle and investigate and prove _ and
agonise and work and fight accepted opinion
if need be? We could do with a few heretics,
the wilder, the more startling and outrageous
the better; for it is from these that a grain
of truth is more likely to be dropped—-per-
haps unwittingly—-th an from within rhe
trite, safe closures of the accepted code.
But Max Meldrum is not one of these. He
is not a wild insurgent with a new gospel,
as so many of his disciples would like to
believe. Vaguely they hope he has a stark
new thought to tell. Surely he is out of the
common rut, a new prophet. Unfortunately
he is not anything of the kind. He is not
the giver of a new thought or an original
outlook for which lie may be a martyr dur-
ing this generation and immortal as a pro-
phet in the next. With much force and em-
phasis he denounces all art in Australia that
is not his own. Therefore it is naturally
expected that he has something new to state.
But in the doctrine enunciated in the course
of two Guide lectures at the Melbourne
National Gallery and another at the Athe-
naeum Hall during his own exhibition there
is not a revolutionary notion or novel
thought to be discovered. He merely carries
an accepted platitude to extreme limits. In
theory lie claims to be a realist, vowing that
the closer one goes to Nature and the more
faithfully and literally one records just
exactly what is seen, the greater and truer
the art. In propounding this doctrine —
which is the primer off the kindergarten of
Realism —Mr. Meldrum delivers the Word as
though it were new, just -when, as a matter
of fact, we are beginning to see that
Realism has had rather too big a day in
Australia —and in other parts of the world
! —to the exclusion of imagination and crea-
tive self-expression.
But it is in his elaboration of this quite
healthy insistence upon reality above all
things that Max Meldrum has secured for
himself a reputation for novelty. “You
cannot see as much as you think you can,”
he asserts. “The eye can see only one thing
at a time, and you should set down just the
limited number of these things in the order
in which the eye sees them.” He also sup-
ports his realism by the explanation that art
is nothing more than optical science: the
artist must simply set down what he sees.
Summed up, it all amounts to a clamorous
insistence upon ABC and the nose on vour
face, but a denial of the existence of DEF
or any other “nebulous terms or ideas” and
a refusal to look at any other feature but
that nose.
Turning to the concrete demonstration of
this ABC and nose on the face, the latest
Meldrum collection of paintings is rather
staggering. If the Meldrum landscapes are
the last word in simple realistic statements
of facts as they are, then all the rest of us
need spectacles. If “the eye sees just one
thing at a time, and these things are set
down in the order in which they are seen,”
the eye evidently never gets as far as sun-
light, any variation from one fixed shade or
green, or anything transparent, bo that it
•won’t see too much, it must protect itself
with a heavy opaque veil, and, glimmering
through this, it discerns one sickly shade
of pink, an opaque, muddy brown, a pulpy
green and a cold blue-grey varied to di d event
intensities by applications of hake white.
And this shrouded eye sees no difference in
texture between a sky at dawn, a tree-trunk,
a man’s coat, a flashing eye, a rose petal and
moonlit water. , . „ . . , .
When a leader is emphatically insistent
in expounding realistic and faithful represen-
tation of things seen as the only art to be
taken seriously, it is surely reasonable to ex-
pect some striking demonstration of this doc-
trine —the apotheosis of realism. .But in a
first-form exercise in drawing a single tree-
trunk, cut off before the curving beauty of its
branches begins —set in a grassy paddock,
no suggestion of realistic representation is to
be found. The tree does not appear to be
rooted in the ground; it is a floating stick 01
perhaps a piece of ribbon, with what might
be a green wall or curtain flat behind it,
with no suggestion of surrounding atmo-
sphere or of the horizontal plane of the solid
earth, no resemblance in texture or color to
grass, fallen leaves or soil. In lecturing
Mr. Meldrum says that “a great artist does
not attempt to do too much; he does not
pretend or try to do more than Ins technique
and his medium can achieve.” In practical
demonstration of this creed, . the lecturer
keeps his subject-matter within the barest
and simplest limitations; but his optical
science seems inadequate to cope with the
work. Something startlingly real, even it
unpleasant, is expected from, a professed
liealist and exponent of objective art to the
exclusion of all creative, imaginative. and
subjective work. But the most fantastic, of
idealists aud romanticists have something
more like real Nature to record than these
products of “rational” optical science.
HATTIE KNIGHT.
What Does Music Mean?
Miss Hattie Knight lately regretted the
“shallow, almost unconscious vessel through
which some divine message of beauty is
conveyed to the world,” and made special
reference in this regard to what she calls
“the soul-stirring tenor, and the spintua.
heights” to which he exalts her. May not
her disappointment with the “vessel” be
partly accounted for by her over-estimation
of the “message”? Knight probably
sees in music potentialities it does not hold.
The subjective state of the listener is a lead-
ing factor in coloring what is received. I
have made my living as a musician for 50
years, and, next to the joy of being loved
by those I love, music remains my chief
delight; but I cannot say I have ever felt
any message come to me, nor have I ever
been exalted to spiritual heights. Exalted,
yes, and to heights—but not spiritual alti-
tudes.
Bedrock consideration of the art of music
is useful after clearing away the jargon of
the schoolmen. Music may be.. roughly said
to be the recurrence of rhythmically ordered
atmospheric waves. It is a semi-barbarous
form of excitation. It is an intoxicant, a
dope, or a drug, as one may choose to call
it. It has no language and cannot convey
any message. It is an emotional alterative.
It finds the latent sestliesia in the most
vicious and the most virtuous.
When the enterprising burglar’s not a-burgling,
And the cut-throat isn’t occupied in crime,
They love to hear the little brook a-g'urgling,
Or listen to the merry village chime.
The neurotic, the erotic and the mystical are
specially sensitive to music’s influence. _ It
is a soporific and an excitant. Scientists,
especially the German pathologists, have done
a good deal in the way of explanation, but
musical mysteries still abundantly fascinate.
Miss Knight, for instance, probably finds
that the voice of her “vacuous tenor” (or
tenorino possibly) exalts her spiritually more
than that of a bass or baritoue. If so,
why? Why is the minor mode a depressant
and the major an exultant?
Why does a dog sit in front of a barrel-
organ "and howl? This question may appear
trivial. It is not. The dog can’t dislike the
“music” or he would flee. If he likes it,
what is the material cause of his pleasure?
It will scarcely be claimed that he is the
recipient of a message, or that he is exalted
to spiritual heights. The illustration is
not here introduced for the sake of the re-
ductio ad absurdum. The dog’s howls and
the spiritual exaltation of. Miss. Knight have
a similar cause —a special disturbance of
the nerve system by sound waves. -Further
than this we cannot go until science helps
us. Some day it may answer many of the
questions that puzzle us. In its replies I
venture to think no such phrase as •■divine
message” will be found; and if such a feel-
ing as “spiritual exaltation” is referred to at
all it will be mentioned as a morbidity.
TORCH.
The Tyranny of Letters
Tile author, far from deserving contempt,
should really be pitied. In the days before
the spark of emulation set something un-
quenchable alight in his brain, he was the
true lover of books. He found in their pages
a sweet relief from the cares of the world,
and the pearl-studded gates of romance were
always ready to swing wide for him once
the magic door was closed and a good book
taken from the crowded shelves. Adventure
thrilled him; love stirred him pleasantly;
and the deeper pages of the students of
character and the essayists and philosophers
sent him into a pleasant musing, from which
he arose like a giant refreshed. A new book
by a favorite author was an event of import-
ance, and the discovery of a new author s
merit embodied the promise of contented
hours ahead.
But now it is different. He has written—
and has been rejected. He has written again
—and at long last his work has found favor.
After that the whole course of his life is
altered —always provided that he has the
instincts of the genuine creator of a shadow
life and does not count an occasional ephem-
eral essay among the pleasant hobbies of a
busy existence. Success, or the elusive
shadow of it, lures him on until there comes
a day when he finds that the pleasant dream
of a year or two ago has become a reality
that dominates his life. In the first place, a
great amount of the time hitherto devoted
to reading must be sacrificed to writing. Out
of the busy round, however, he manages to
save a precious hour or two to be spent over
a book. He picks up a novel —but somehow
it reads differently. Sub-consciously, and
through the medium of the printed page be-
fore him, he is exploring the mind of the
author, seeking for motives, and pulling the
good man’s plot to shreds. The adventure
that previously thrilled him now seems crude,
and he lays the book aside with a secret con-
viction that he could have done better him-
self. He picks up a volume of Gibbon or an
older historian, and a bare fact will leap up
to him from the pages and send him off into
a long train of thought. The hour that be-
gan with a pleasant delving into an old
favorite will end with a stubborn wrestling
with a refractory idea, and an essay will
evolve from a mere trifle and cause the book
to be laid aside while the idea spreads itself
across paper. Life assumes the proportions
of one great flow of ink or typewriter ribbon,
and relentless work will dominate the writer
even through the intimacies of his home.
There are other matters, also, which harass
the dealer in literary wares, and the road to
the phantom of success is inevitably thorny.
And yet, when all is said and done, who,
among all the inky tribe, would forego his
little crown of literary success, real or imag-
in ary ?
M. H. HOLCROFT.
A Satchel of Books
The Loser Pays, by Bert James (States Publishing
Co.). A novelette of mystery and murder. An
innocent victim, a wicked man and a faithful maid,
With a detective thrown in, are the principal
characters in a story woven with some skill.
The Third Warning, by Augustus Muir (Methuen).
A novel that professes to have in it “a mystery and
a thrill and a spice of love” suggests a literary
cocktail to stimulate the jaded appetite of the reader
of “shockers.” In this case the familiar ingredients
are nicely blended, and the author succeeds in
keeping his secret till the last few pages. Appa-
rently a first book; undoubtedly a good attempt.
Lazare , by Henri. Bcraud (Thornton Butterworth).
After 16 years of insanity, Jean Mourin, musical
composer, returns to his sane self. In the period of
lapse he had assumed the character of one Gervais,
a carpenter. On the return to normal life he finds,
himself in a changed world and without friends.
Out of this dual personality the author weaves a story
that may appeal to lovers of the occult, but will
tax the patience and credulity of others.
My Confessions, by Montague Noel Newton (AVernei
Laurie). Making money out of one’s sins takes a
new form in this narrative. The publisher launches
the literary barque with the comment that “Monty
Newton admits to a life-time of crooked dealings and
in this amazing book tells you how he cleaned up
a million t’ounds in his ‘Ventures.’ ” The book has
a certain interest. Whether the world wouldn t be
better without it js another question.
Australian and New Zealand Press Directory, 1925
(The Country Press). This is the fourth edition, and
it is even more comprehensive than its predecessors.
Its object is to “give advertisers reliable information
regarding the scope and influence of the various media
as well as indicate the field of their activities.
Apart from this special object, the_ directory supplies
maps and carefully compiled statistics of the agn-
cultural and other products of each State, giving
the publication a value to others than the class to
which it makes its particular appeal. It suggests
possibilities of still further extensions.
In a review of “The Keeper’s Book”
(R.P. 6/8/’2G) the writer, dealing with British game
laws, states that “it was only in our own time that
the [British] Ground Game Act made the hare and
the rabbit private property and forbade them to the
multitude.” This is not so. The Ground Game
Act, passed in the ’eighties, gave power to the
tenant of the land to kill hares and rabbits; previ-
ously not even the tenant could legally kill them
without the consent of his landlord.
“Grub Street”: In a leading article (B. 30/7/’25)
the writer, ridiculing a statement that no Australian
artist or writer was honored first in his own country,
asked whether Henry Lawson had to take his bush
ballads to Paris for appreciation. Perhaps not, but
I am not sure that his prose works have not had
far more solid appreciation “ez fur away ez Paris is”
than in Lawson’s own country. Galswoithv lias.
said that to him Australia means Lawson and that
Lawson is valued in England more than here. As
for Paris, I have read “His Father’s Mate” in French,
“Camarade de Son Pere.” And who is to say that
publishers here were not impressed when Blackwoods
published “Joe Wilson and His Mates” in 1901?
The point is that if an essentially Australian wntei
like Lawson, the life of whose words lay in our
native idiom, needed overseas approval to give him
momentum, how much poorer chance have less gifter
writers of getting a start without applause from
abroad? This provincialism is a disease not con-
fined to Australia, of course; America has it in a
Very virulent form.
“Old Boy”: Like “Obfuscus” (B. 30/7/'25), I have
heard a great merchant dictating to a typist Ray
your letter of and I writhed, especially as he
did not learn any Latin at all at school (I know,
because I was there and was in the Latin class, and
he was not). But it is not with Latin alone that
one suffers this misery. The imitation of French is
as bad. People talk about a “cabaray” who would
never ask for a glass of “claray” when in one, and
nobody calls a personal servant a plain valet except
those who employ them- —the rest of us say v allay
for fear of being thought iggerant of French, though
the best English dictionaries support the English
phonetic pronunciation. But we all like to be
thought linguists. That is the reason we call
visiting foreigners “Mongseet,” "Seenyor,” etc., in-
stead of giving the title in use by ourselves—a
courtesy they pay us when we visit their countiies.
This striving of the ignorant to appear cultured is
almost as painful as the labored efforts of timid
or inexperienced writers to prove themselves literal y
by avoiding at all costs of euphony or clarity what
it absurdly called the split infinitive—meaning the
placing of an adverb in the space left for it in
English between the preposition and the infinitive
verb. I was glad when my union—the Oxford Society
for Pure English—gave the death-knock to that
imbecility.
“Whelp”: Chesterton is not the only English writer
who has given a word to Vi agga Wagga (B.
0/8/’2C). The late George Augustus Sala, when lectur-
ing in Australia in 1885, found the town much to
his liking. This was his testimonial (“Life and
Adventures”): “Great financial success was also mu-
lct at AVagga Wagga, a really pretty town, with
the name of which all those who remember the
Tichborne trial will be familiar. The Assizes were
on when we arrived, and by good luck the Grown
Prosecutor turned out to be an old friend of mine.
I had a capital house on that and the succeeding
night—the Judge came, the Bar and solicitors mus-
tered in full force, the prosecutors and the witnesses
were all to the fore, and I could almost have
believed that the prisoners, escorted by friendly
warders, were also present.” Sala was not so
favorably impressed by Mudgee. “It was here,’ he
records, “that I underwent one of the most serious
snubs I ever experienced.... It came from a lady,
who, when I had come to the end of what I thought
was a pathetic and picturesque description of the
appearance of her Majesty Queen Victoria at her
coronation in June, 1848, exclaimed, ‘Rubbidge.


Will Balloon Tyres Stand Severe Service?
They will if they are made of SUPERTWIST —and Goodyears are
Despite the swift popularity of balloon
tyres, many people are still a little
doubtful about them.
1 hey concede their extra comfort and
good appearance, but question if
balloons will stand severe usage.
No such question need disturb the
motorist who is thinking about
Goodyear Balloon Tyres.
For, by force of a new remarkable
cord material called SUPER-
TWIST, Goodyear anticipated and
answered this question long before
offering its balloon tyres to the public.
Its special adaptability to the balloon
tyre is by no means the result of
fortunate chance.
SUPERTWIST is the outcome of
deliberate and expert design, of long
and intelligent search, in Goodyear’s
own fabric mills, for a new material
to meet the new needs of the low-
pressure, flexible-sidewall tyre.
You want the SUPERTWIST
advantages of greater elasticity and
durability in the tyres you buy.
Being an exclusive Goodyear de-
velopment, SUPERTWIST is used
in Goodyear Tyres only.
BALLOON TYRES


SINGLE-SIX SEVEN-PASSENGER SEDAN
NOTHING like the latest Packard Single-Six Sedans has ever been
seen in Australia before. Fully equipped with every luxurious com-
fort right down to the last detail, at the prices of <£9so and £1025, they
represent value which is revolutionary. The refinement of these closed cars
is inimitably Packard. Built to wear well for ten years they couple luxur-
iousness with economy. The latest features mentioned below form
a combination not to be found in any other car in the world.

The Chassis Pressure Lubricator—or as it is sometimes called, the a one-shot oiling
system”— on the new Packards, make the motors almost human in caring for them-
selves. To oil the 45 chassis points requiring lubrication it is only necessary to pull
out and then release a plunger which is affixed to the dash-board. (See illustration).
Lubricating the chassis is no longer a garage job. It takes just one operation.
The Motor Oil Rectifier prevents dilution, retains the viscous condition of the
motor oil. It promotes longer life and smooth and silent operation by maintain-
ing all the desirable properties existing in fresh oil. Packard owners find that the
Motor Oil Rectifier multiplies the life of the motor oil by five, and that they need
to change oil but four or five times a year.
Balloon tyres together with an exceptional spring length and wheelbase make the
riding ease of these latest Packard models incomparable.

Better Lighting
in the Home.
No room should be lighted in such a manner that
individual lights are visible.
Illumination should be transmitted, dissipated and
reflected light.
Good illumination requires a sufficient intensity of
wall-diffused light and the elimination of glare.
Miller fittings supply that combination of abundant
light and soft-colored tints so desirable in dining-room
illumination, yet heretofore difficult to secure.
When Miller fittings are lighted a flood of white light
is distributed throughout the room, and the atmosphere
created gives beautiful soft tones to the other furnishings
and decorations, providing that pleasing harmony which
is the desideratum in planning efficient lighting.
The lighted or unlighted Miller fitting is a very
beautiful ornament of distinctive lines and shape.
Not only do Miller fittings give pleasing and
economical illuminations, but they add to the beauty of
the furnishings and adornment of any home.
Better lighting is half-furnished.

“Why, she looks as young and charming as her daughter.” How
often have’ you heard these words spoken about women who have retained
their girlish appearance while their family is quickly growing up aroum,
them! Have you ever stopped to think what the real secret of their
vouth is? The turning-point of youth to early middle-age comes when a
little silvery grev creeps in amongst that crowning glory of women—-their
hair. No matter the youthful bloom upon the cheek, or the figure its easy
girlish form, the hair appearance is the mirror of the age.
Stop for a moment and think of the really smart women that you
know: they do not allow those tell-tale grey hairs, the unmistakable symbol
of advancing years, to creep in and spoil their beauty. . .
Grev hair can never be fashionable —it is the first sign of old age. A
man ma'v be as old as he feels—but a woman is as old as her hair.
Or Allen’s Mexican Walnut Stain has enjoyed the confidence of women
for 25 ‘vear&—■it is perfectly harmless, easy to apply, immediate m action
and above all, undetectable. Carefully carry out the instructions and let
it restore your hair to its natural shade. Grey hairs will vanish like ma b ic
and vou-th' will walk in at your door.

Midnight in the Valley.
When midnight came to the valley,
Sombre and dark and wide,
Stirless grew oak and sally
Down by the riverside.
While ferns in the darkness slumbered,
Fronded and tall and soft.
Bright were the stars unnumbered,
Moving, white-fired, aloft.
As though by some spirit bidden
Noiseless the river flowed;
Mute were the night-birds hidden,
Each in its green abode.
No wind from the heights came telling
Secrets to field and wood ;
Lightless each farmer’s dwelling
Back from the roadside stood.
Where, tasselled and tall and sleeping,
Crops in the lowlands grew,
Mists, through the darkness creeping,
Up from the river drew.
When midnight came to the valley
Holding the land in thrall,
Stirless grew oak and sally—
Stirless and silent all.

FRUITS OF THE NAVIGATION ACT.
Tiie settlement, real or bogus, of the ship-
ping strike—-it has broken out again in
several forms and places notwithstanding the
settlement —has by no means removed the
necessity for remodelling the Navigation Act.
On the contrary, the cry for relief from the
monopoly established by that measure is
louder than ever, and the complainants have
an unanswerable case. When Parliament
decided to reserve the coastal trade of che
Commonwealth for ships on the Australian
register it thought it was helping to build
up a great mercantile marine. What it
really did was to forge a weapon which, as
wielded by the associated companies and the
imported bosses of the Seamen’s Union, has
smitten the Australian manufacturer in his
own market, inflicted serious loss and injury
on Tasmania and Westralia, and made the
name of Australia cursed in Papua and the
Mandated Territory. The reports of the
Tariff Board and the Navigation Commission
have shown how an agricultural machine
sold in Melbourne for £lO5 cost £125 in
Westralia; how 425. 6d. per ton was charged
for shipping fencing-wire from Newcastle to
Fremantle as against 38s. per ton from New
York to Fremantle; how the freight rates on
maize were Is. 2d. a bushel from Cairns to
Melbourne and Is. Ofd. a bushel from
S’Africa to Melbourne; how a Brisbane
manufacturing co. had to pay 41s. per ton for
the carriage of its cement to Cairns, whereas
British cement was carried to all Queens-
land ports for 245. per ton; and so forth.
Of course, the tactics of the Seamen’s Union
are a factor in these monstrous charges (they
have been increased since the Tariff Board
reported that “much of the benefit conceded
by the tariff is lost through the additional
cost in freight on Australian goods”), which
are so fixed as to cover losses on past strikes
and others to come. And the effects of the
frequent Walsh-Johanson hold-up are
more damaging in many ways than those of
the steep cargo rates, injurious as they are.
* * * *
Substantial Queensland orders for machin-
ery had to be refused two or three months
ago by Vic. manufacturers because the usual
shipping strike was raging, and railway
transport was too expensive. American
agents got the orders. Again, the poisoning
of rabbits had to be suspended for a month
in parts of the Westralian wheat belt because
supplies of poison ran out and could not
be replenished by steamer, Walsh and his
squarehead satellite having tied up the steam-
ers. As a result, thousands of acres of pro-
mising crops were destroyed by the pest.
Cases like these are seldom mentioned by
the papers which minister to the vanity
of crackbrained Communists by publishing
their sinful rubbish, but they occur
in plenty during every shipping strike.
And the Red tyranny set up by the Naviga-
tion Act has well-nigh ruined the Tasmanian
tourist traffic. Before the Act came into
force thousands of mainlanders made the
“apple trip” to Tasmania by British mail
steamers calling at Fremantle, Adelaide,
Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Now they
are restricted to WALSii-controlled boats,
which are held up every holiday season, with-
out fail, so the apple tripper of other days
goes to Hobart and Launceston no more.
Curiously enough, though British steamers
may not carry Westralian passengers from
Fremantle to Hobart, they may carry them
from Fremantle to Sydney for transhipment
to Maoriland, provided the passengers have
booked to Auckland or Wellington. Also, if a
Sydney man goes to Fremantle to meet a
wife or daughter returning from abroad, he
is forbidden to accompany her on the steamer
if he gives Sydney as his destination, but
not if he buys a Fremantle-Wellington ticket
and sacrifices the Sydney-Wellington portion.
* * » *
Another anomalous feature of the Act, as
administered, is that steamers owned by
overseas companies and manned by colored
labor are permitted to carry cargo and pas-
sengers between Fremantle and Derby and
the intervening ports, Geraldton, Carnarvon,
Onslow, Port Sampson, Port Hedland and
Broome. But a corresponding exemption is
denied to the settlers in Papua and the Man-
dated Territory, although they have just as
much right to the privilege as the West-
ralians concerned, except that they have no
votes. In the words of the Royal Commis-
sioners who recently visited the Common-
wealth’s island possessions, Papua is treated
as part of Australia for the purposes of the
Navigation Act and as a foreign country for
the purposes of the Customs Tariff Act. In
one way and another Papua costs the Aus-
tralian taxpayer about £lOO,OOO a year, and
upwards of a million has been expended on
the Mandated Territory by the Expropriation
Board alone. It seems a big price to pay for
ruining the planters, and that (as the Gov-
ernment has been warned by numerous
authorities and investigators, from Lieut.-
Governor Murray to these Royal Commis-
sioners) will be the inevitable result of ex-
tending the Navigation Act to their islands
and compelling them to send their copra to
Sydney for reshipment to Europe, instead
of to Europe direct. As for the effect of the
Navigation Act on the Australian mercantile
marine, Senators Elliott and Duncan,
members of the Royal Commission, point out
that "the mercantile marine was established
and built up prior to the Act, and without
any protection whatever against foreign com-
petition.” In those days the companies “ran
more ships, gave a better service and their
profits were greater.” That they gave a
better service can be borne out by any coastal
traveller whose experience goes back, say, 15
years. As regards finance, “balance-sheets
reveal that whatever profits the shipping com-
panies are able to declare are derived, for
the most part, from their investments in
other concerns,” principally coal-mines, while
the maritime unions have lost enormously in
wages during their many strikes and the Sea-
men’s Union, in addition to having many
members unemployed as a result of the
latest incident in the campaign “to expedite
the social revolution,” is almost broke. And
the number of privately-owned vessels on the
Australian register has actually declined since
the coasting trade was reserved for those
vessels, with the Westralian exception men-
tioned. In 1914, exclusive of dredges, tugs
and sailing craft, Australia had 1030 vessels
of an aggregate of 320,465 tons. In 1924
there were 954 vessels of 393,520 tons. And
included in that total were 5.4 steamers of
the Commonwealth Government Line which,
when it brought its losses down to £1,171.569
as it did in the last 12 months for which
proper accounts are available, was reckoned
to have had a good year.
■* * * *
The Elliott-Duncan section of the Royal
Commission’s report closed with these recom-
mendations :
That the coastal trading provisions of the Navi-
gation Act be repealed.
That there be substituted therefor adequate duties,
under the Customs Tariff Act, upon foreign shipping,
with a lesser preferential rate upon British shipping,
calculated in the case of cargoes upon the rates* of
freight charged per ton and in the case of passengers
upon the fares charged.
Such are obviously the lines on which the
Act will have to be remodelled, although
special treatment will be necessary for parts
in which special circumstances exist, such as
North Westralia, the Northern Territory, the
Gulf Country, Papua and the Mandated
Territory. The shipping industry is entitled
to Protection against cheap-labor competi-
tion, but there is not a shred of justification
for the continuance of a monopoly which has
been cynically and persistently abused. That
monopoly was designed to be a benefit to
Australia, instead of which it has been an
unmitigated curse. The coasting-trade
clauses of the Navigation Act represent a
grant of power to foreign-born Communists
who are never happy except when they are
playing some dirty trick on the much too
tolerant Commonwealth in which they get
their easy living. That power will have to
be resumed.
THE TARIFF DEFORM MOVEMENT.
Every few days news is published that
another branch of the Town and Country
Union for Tariff Reform has been estab-
lished somewhere, and is going strong, or
intends to go. The numerical strength of
the union is uncertain; all the same, it
is part of a chain of organisations which
count for a good deal. It is, in the first
place, a tool of the importing crowd, which
wants the tariff reduced in the hope that
Australia will thereupon manufacture less,
and employ less well-paid Australian white
labor, and import more from cheap-labor
countries of any color. According to the latest
published comparisons the Commonwealth
imported more, in proportion to population,
than any country save one or two, and it
is incurring more foreign debt than a dozen
big countries put together in the effort to
pay the bill, its exports being quite insuffi-
cient for the purpose; and still the importer
wants more—he is a difficult cormorant to
satisfy. He employs little labor, and it
is mostly low-skilled labor; he is to a great
extent a non-Australian himself, and his tent
isn’t so fixed as that of the manufacturer.
The Laborite (Communist or plain) rather
approves of the Town and Country Union
and concerns of the sort. It wants to de-
stroy or greatly reduce Australian manufac-
tures, as they exist now, for the benefit of
the importer. He wants to do the. same,
either to bring about complete but peaceful
State ownership, or to create such chaos as
will lead to complete and blanky revolution.
The Country Party, which represents, or
thinks it does, the man on the land and
the “primary producer” in all shapes, is
naturally a large element in a Town and
Country Union. The man on the land is
supplied with quite over-colored ideas of the
amount which he contributes to the revenue
in the shape of duties on agricultural im-
plements and machinery, and the fortune he
would save if he could buy foreign plant free
of duty, and destroy the local factories.
Agricultural implement and machinery are
classified under 28 headings, and in seven
cases the preferential duty is nil. In the
others, it is various. The agricultural person
has no guarantee that the prices of these
things w r ould be any lower if the duties were
taken off and local industry destroyed, but
Bruxner’s N.S.W. Country party tells him
they would be lower. It really doesn’t know
much about it, having very little commercial
knowledge, but it has been told these things
by the importers and the newspapers pub-
lished in their interest. The importers and
their organs may be strictly truthful and un-
selfish, or they may not.
* * * -*
The bucolic gentleman is thus furnished
with the idea that, by throwing himself into
the Freetrade movement, he may get the
small tax taken off the alien chaff cutter,
while the big duties remain on silk hats and
gold watches. In other words, he hopes to
make war with limited liability. But the
tariff-reduction movement would be difficult
to stop when started; and though the im-
porting crowd is quite willing to avail itself
of the agricultural vote in opposition to local
manufactures, its chief interest is in other
things than chaffcutters. If it can engineer a
very material reduction of tariff revenue, and
it is necessary in consequence to increase
direct taxation —land-tax and the like —it
will probably consider that it has done a
great stroke, though in the general impoverish-
ment of the community it may find that it
wasn’t altogether the genius it imagined itself.
Considering the immense business the im-
porters are doing under the present insuffi-
cient duties they might be wiser to be
content, and not make experiments with the
fowl which lays the golden eggs. As for
the farmer and the “primary producer” in
general, he will almost certainly realise, in
the moment of success, if it unfortunately
arrives, that he has been a considerable fool
and the victim of a great take-down. The
tariff revenue collected during the last year
for which complete figures are handy was
under 33 millions (224 in Customs and
10J in Excise). The whole State and
Federal land-tax collections were below four
millions. To reduce the tariff revenue by a
mere 12 per cent, at the risk of having to
make good by increasing the land-tax by
100 per cent, wouldn’t be much relief at
the Customs end and would be a shockingly
bad bargain at the land-tax end. Cer-
tainly if some real “relief” was granted under
the tariff, no Ministry that Australia is
likely to possess could balance its finances
without heavy land taxation.
* * * *
Tom Mann used to tell “the workers”
that they had nothing to lose but their
chains. Some of the farmers’ friends try to
make them believe the same thing. They
had better not be gulled. If Freetrade were
established and the Customs revenue were lost
or even seriously reduced, no class could be
called upon to give up more by way of com-
pensation than the farmer, and that is apart
from the almost certain increase of land-
tax. Unpayable railways are always being
built “to open up new wheat country.” The
products of the farm are carried by rail at
specially low rates —often at half cost or less.
A troublesome shipping line is maintained
at enormous loss to keep down freights, and
these are certainly not freights on factory
exports. Something approaching £80,000,000
has lately been invested in the promotion of
“settlement.” The “primary producer” who
cultivates sugar is granted a monopoly of
the local market. Cotton bonuses and meat-
export bonuses are not unknown, likewise
aids for the purchase of wire-netting and
sundries. Almost everything the farmer
grows is heavily protected. He is told with
icy scorn that he gains nothing by this, but
that is merely to test his creduliiy. There
is hardly a port where cheap-labor foreign
ships, untrammelled by a Navigation Act
couldn’t land cargoes of foreign food and
compete against the local producer if Free-
trade conditions prevailed. Even imported
wheat would be quite a possibility. Another
matter for which the N. S. Wales agricul-
turist, at any rate, might possibly be more
grateful than he seems to be is that he pays
no land-tax to the State except in the unin-
corporated Far West. It was the tariff re-
venue which made it possible to abolish the
State land-tax nearly 20 years ago. If it
was revived, and on the Tasmanian scale,
the new bill would be well over £1,000,000
per annum. In addition to other helps the
farmer has the cheapest labor available, and
awards have troubled him little. But de-
spite all these benefits the cry for the free
admission of foreign hoes and shovels was
used with great effect on the N. S. Wales
farmer at the recent elections, he being appa-
rently unable to understand that Bruxner
and his State colleagues have no more, influ-
ence over tariffs than over tides and currents.
The resultant vote-splitting put Lang and
the semi-Communists in power, and in their
hunger for the 44-hour week and for money
to spend on large devices they are likely to
give the “primary producer’’ an awakening.
UNCONSCIOUS LIBEL.
To a recently-published novel W. Somerset
Maugham attached the following “Author’s
note”:—
As the law stands at present, writers of fiction
are in a very awkward predicament. Choosing the
names of their characters at haphazard, from Brad-
shaw’s Guide, the telephone directory or, as is the
practice of the author of this novel, from the obituary
column of the Times, it is inevitable that they should
sometimes hit upon the name of a living person who
may suppose that a reference to him is intended;
and if for purposes of verisimilitude they give one of
their characters a post or office which exists in an
actual place, the holder of that post or office is
liable to assume that a reflection is cast upon him.
He went on to point out that it is hard
to believe that any writer would be such a
fool as deliberately to libel a total stranger:
but as inadvertence is in this case no excuse,
he proceeded to disclaim all reality for both
the characters and places concerned in his
novel. Disclaimers to the same effect are
to be found in other novels issued by cau-
tious publishers.
The doctrine of what may be conveniently
described as “Unconscious libel” had its
origin in a case, confirmed on appeal, which
came before the English courts 15 years ago.
The decision put a new and fearsome peril
in the way of all publishers of newspapers,
magazines, novels and other printed matter.
Thereafter they rode with black Care
behind them —the ever-present ghost of a
possible libel suit. The old definition of the
offence was “a malicious defamation ex-
pressed in printing or writing or by signs,
pictures, etc., tending to injure the reputa-
tion of another, and thereby exposing such
person to public hatred, contempt or ridi-
cule.” -Malice might, however, be rebutted,
where otherwise inferred, by proof of cir-
cumstances showing that the statement com-
plained of was privileged. That is an in-
complete statement of the position, but suffi-
cient for our purposes.
The element of malice, in its legal sense,
was an essential in the case. In the matter
of Artemus .Tones it was difficult to find,
and, seemingly, the Court did not worry
about it. Artemus was a London barrister
in practice who at one time had been on the
staff of a Sunday newspaper and contributed
signed articles to its columns. Some time
after he had found a more remunerative
sphere in the law, his old newspaper gave
him what he claimed to be a nasty dig. If
published an article defaming an “Artemus
.Tones,” and some of his friends gave evi
dence in the suit he brought for damages
that they had thought it referred to him.
Certainly the name “Artemus” is unusual,
but no one could say the same of “Jones."
The author of the article and the editor of
the newspaper swore that they did not know
of the existence of the wounded Artemus,
and that gentleman’s counsel agreed to accept
the disclaimer. His contention was that it
didn’t matter whether they knew his client
or not —he claimed damages all the same.
And so in effect the Court held. “A person
charged with libel,” said the C.J., “cannot
defend himself by saying that he intended
in his breast not to defame, or that he in-
tended not to defame the plaintiff, if in fact
he did both. He has none the less imputed
something disgraceful, and has none the less
injured the plaintiff.” So that if you let-
off defamatory fireworks and they happen to
hit someone you never intended to hit, and
didn’t even know was there, you’ve got to
pay. After that decision authors had to con-
sider their villains very carefully. Mr.
Maugham’s system of consulting obituary
notices w T ould be quite ineffective, since you
could never determine when you had come
to the last of arty particular tribe —there
would always be some outstanding Smiths.
Browns and Robinsons. Manufacturing
queer names is equally dangerous, since it only
narrows the circle. The name-factory has
long since used up all available material.
The decision was much discussed in legal
circles and with a note of dubiety. The
editor of one law magazine in a vein of satire
attached a note to the names of those -well-
known characters in legal fiction “John
Doe” and “Richard Roe” to the effect that
they were purely fictitious and referred to
no living persons.
It is very doubtful if the disclaimers of the
cautious authors and publishers are of very
much value, in view of the decision in the
case of Artemus Jones ; for putting in print
the fact that you intend in your breast not
to defame anyone doesn’t alter the matter
if he can show that he has been defamed in
the eyes of his triends. Some light, however,
has been shed in a quite recent decision.
Shaw v. London Express Newspaper, Ltd.
It is not decisive, but it is helpful. Last year
the Sundat Express published an article
entitled “The Mystery Murder of Camden,
with a sub-title of “Phyllis Dimmock s
Death.” In the body of this article, which
dealt with a once widely-discussed murder
trial, there appeared a facsimile of a post-
card, said to have been received by the
Phyllis who had been done to death: it


boro the address: “Mrs. B. SHAW> 29 St.
Paul’s-road, Camden Town, N., where
Phyllis had once lived as a supposed m«
ried woman with a man named ©haw.
the course of time, after many tenants
come and gone, another person of the na
of Shaw came to live at this address; a
it was whilst he was there that the Sum . y
newspaper, by a sort of fatalistic act o
journalism, saw lit to revive the old Camue
mystery. The new Mr. Shaw was muc 1
troubled and afflicted in mind, so he led the
Court to believe, by the publication. Jie haci
been quite unaware of the house s associa-
tion with the affair when he began to live
there. So distressed was he that he went to
the Court for damages. He had, betoie
taking action, written to the newspaper
claiming compensation for the alleged de-
famation, and it had responded by publishing
an apology and explaining that Shaw the
second was not in any way associated with
the Shaw referred to on the postcard. In
this case the Judge went so far as to refuse
to admit evidence to show that the plaintiff
had been asked by persons in the neighbor-
hood whether he had anything to do with
the subject matter of the article, and ruled
that the statement complained of could not
in law be regarded as defamatory and con-
sequently there was no case to go to a jury.
The effect of this judgment is not m con-
flict so much as in explanation of the de-
cision in Jones v. Httlton and Co., where it
was laid down that “in an action for libel u
is no defence to show that the defendant did
not intend to defame the plaintiff if reason-
able people would think the language to be
defamatory of the plaintiff. ’ In Hhaw s
case we get some inkling of what the Court
considers reasonable people would not think.
It doesn’t seem to go much further cer-
tainly not far enough.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Policy of National Defencelessness.
At the invitation of the Victorian Labor
College, Deputy Federal-leader Anstey re-
cently regaled a Melbourne Trades Hall
audience with his views on Defence, and they
are presumably also the party’s views. Having
announced that “the party has declared m
favor of a system of National Defence m a
desire to preserve the open road to the
achievement of its ideals,” the orator pro-
ceeded to extol the virtues of the system •
without, of course, explaining what the sys-
tem was—and concluded a memorable speech
with the following words
It is practically impossible for any nation to
invade Australia because of its remoteness from
other countries, and neither America nor Japan
could invade us because there are no naval bases.
Whether this last remark referred to Aus-
tralia’s lack of naval bases or the other
people’s is not quite clear. But it is a
small point, and doesn’t really matter. Fed.-
leader Charlton, in attempting later to ex-
plain his lieutenant’s indiscretions, was not
very helpful. All he would say, indeed, was
that “the party has a Defence policy, which
will be elaborated in the proper place and
at the proper time.” The amount of Defence,
national, Imperial or any other sort, which
is to be expected from a Government whose
creed is contained in Anstey’s concluding
sentences may well be imagined ; and until
Charlton makes it plain that neither he nor
his followers subscribe to Anstey’s views
on Australia’s immunity from invasion, pious
protestations that the party really has a
sound Defence scheme are not likely to be
taken seriously. If a party honestly profess-
ing the belief that this country’s geographi-
cal position renders it safe from attack
ever finds itself in power, then the aboli-
tion of the fighting services must logically
be one of its first actions. Of course, im-
munity from invasion is not, and never
has been, guaranteed by a few thousand
miles of sea; and Australia’s “remoteness
from other countries” provides no safe-
guard from attack. Several centuries ago,
when sea transport was in its infancy, Spain
conquered South America. More recently
Britain subdued India and a large part of
Africa. In the late war a few million
American troops crossed 3000 miles of ocean
and landed on a foreign shore, and that
in spite of the fact that the second most
powerful fleet in the world was opposed to
their doing so. In view of this, anyone
who imagines that her mere geographical
position can save Australia from attack must
be weak-minded. That neither America nor
Japan has naval bases within striking dis-
tance of this continent is also incorrect. Both
these countries have several well-equipped
bases around their own coasts; and if Aus-
tralia were navally defenceless, these would
prove quite near enough for the purpose.
Isolation alone affords no protection from
invasion—neither the dampness of the
ocean nor its extent is likely to deter
a resolute invader. Reliable charts of
the world can be bought to-day for 3s.
Od. With one of these apiece, and the re-
quisite quantity of fuel to get them t<i their
destination, nothing but. bad navigation or
engine trouble could prevent an unlimited
number of enemy transports from unloading
their human freight on the shores of the
most isolated undefended countries. An in-
vader only requires a base in close proximity
to the shores of the invaded country if
the latter possesses a navy capable of
harrying his transport routes. If the victim
has no navy, the invader does not need any
advanced bases, for his communications can-
not be cut, and, no matter what distance they
may have to steam, his transports will always
be safe. These are the first principles of
naval strategy, as true to-day as they were
a thousand years ago. And the moral which
they point is equally true. The only safe-
guard against invasion is a strong navy.
The stronger the navy the safer the safe-
guard.
An Imported Strike.
The idea of having a British shipping strike
or industrial war fought out m Australia,
instead of where it belongs, has at least the
advantage of novelty. The advantage may be
doubtful, but about the novelty there is no
doubt at all. Australia is thus elevated to
the dignity long held by Poland and Bel-
gium—cockpits of Europe, and countries
where other nations fought out their quar-
rels to the discomfort of the native popula-
tion. Both are flat countries, which made
them handy battlefields, and Australia is like-
wise flat. The position is that the British
seaman (the A. 8.), who receives £lO per
month with board and unstable lodgings,
is invited to face a reduction to £9. He
registers, in many eases, as an unemployed
when he goes ashore, and collects the dole
till he goes afloat again, but that is not
wages, and there is no certainty about it.
British shipping companies, except those
which employ colored labor at much less
than £lO per month, are making dreadful
weather. Some of the badness is blamed on
the British coal situation. When the coal-
miners secured their 42-liour week the num-
ber of workers required to produce a given
amount of coal increased by 24 per cent.,
and every industry which required coal had
a depressed feeling in consequence. Even
the preaching trade, which makes no use
of fuel, except indirectly by allusion to the
flames of Tophet, fell upon emaciated times.
It is quite possible that the crews of British
ships in Australian waters did not originate
the idea of starting a revolt here against
their employers, and against their own onion
in Britain, and that the event was staged tor
for them by the usual trio of imported fire-
brands. If it is a spontaneous movement it
will doubtless spread to the ports of the
world, with the possible partial exception ot
Britain’s own. They might be omitted as
regards long-distance craft with the idea that
it is policy to lure the ships away to remote
parts and hold them there, and that if the
seamen maroon themselves in sunny climes
instead of in bleak old England the sunny
climes will find provision for them in some
shape or form. The sunny climes may be
accompanied by a favorable political atmo-
sphere. The course of events which looks
most probable is that action will be taken
by the Federal Government at the request ot
the British Government, but under the Brit-
ish law which, like a faithful hound, follows
its country’s ships from place to place. The
exact whichness of the law really doesn t
matter. Then the strikers (or deserters) will
probably receive sentences and be put into
State gaols, there being no Federal gaol to
put them in. Whereupon the five State Gabor
Governments will very likely let them out
again, and ask the Prime Minister what the
deuce he thinks he is anyhow.
♦
Sugar Manufacture—and Some Others.
It was in 1915 that the Commonwealth lent
a helping hand to the cane-sugar industry,
almost entirely a Queensland affair, and it is
still lending. A leading feature ot the case
is the prohibition of the import of sugar
grown by colored labor, which means that
all foreign cane-sugar is shut out, the nigger
being universal. Still, a heavy duty is fixed
by law to make sure, and to keep out beet-
sugar, which is white; and substitutes for
sugar (saccharin and the like) carry duties
of 305., 355. and 40s. per lb. to make very
sure indeed. Prices are fixed to make certain
that internal competition won’t make sugar
unduly cheap, but people in the jam-making
and fruit-preserving line are allowed a sub-
stantial reduction. Their business is partly
an export one, and if they were charged on
the same basis as the retail grocer they would
be ruined, and the one-sidedness of the busi-
ness would cause a row. The one fly in the
ointment is that more or less artificial pros-
perity has created a surplus for export, and
the foreigner can’t be compelled, not even at
the cannon’s mouth (if Queensland possessed
a cannon), to pay more than current nigger
price for this surplus. Therefore further
expansion of the industry is repressed for
the present in Queensland lest low prices
abroad should grievously damage the results
of high prices at home. In a valiant mood
Prime Minister Bruce declared that, when
the prohibition embargo on the importation
of foreign cane-sugar expired this year, it
would not be renewed. In future this par-
ticular producer was to be content with Pro-
tection through the Customs, the same as
the manufacturer has to be when the manufac-
turer has the luck to get any Protection at all.
Shortly after there was a scrambling sound
and a rain of leaves and twigs as the heavy-
weight gentleman climbed down, and the
embargo, the duties, the fixed price and the
monopoly of the Australian market are re-
newed till .Tune, 1928. They might as well
be renewed indefinitely, and considered as
fixtures. No doubt the sugar industry is
worth cultivating at the price, but it is un-
fortunate that the Hughes and Bruce
variety of politician doesn’t extend his range
of vision a little. The manufacture of sugar
from local cane for local supply (and for
export if possible) is a most commendable
ambition. But so is the manufacture for
local supply of woollen cloth from local sheep
and of cotton and linen goods from local cot-
ton and flax. Practically everything made of
cotton and linen comes in free provided it is
of British make or ostensibly so, and woollen
goods are very insufficiently protected under
the preferential tariff —indeed, some minor
lines are not protected at all. The cotton-
grower receives Government aid, largely in
the hope that he may supply material for
British factories, but the cotton manufacturer
doesn’t. Both he and the woollen man are
treated like the contemned dog of Holy Writ.
Their industries employ much less of the
foreign and more of the Australian element
than the sugar-maker does, yet if either of
them suggested a monopoly of the local mar-
ket for the local product the chances are
that the Federal Cabinet would be carried
home to bed and its condition pronounced
serious. An obvious feature of the industrial
depression is shown in the factory wage-
rate, w'liich the Federal Statistician reports
as follows: —
Factory Wages per Employee per Annum.
1918- .. £129 16 0 | 1921-22 .. £179 410
1919- .. 143 13 0 | 1922-23 .. 179 18 5
1920- .. 169 5 7 I 1923-24 .. 180 0 <
Increased wages, and increased cost of
materials, and new plant because of higher
wages, are not much more than incidents if
Protection rises to correspond. But apart
from the Government’s breathless haste to
make assurance trebly sure for the sugar
industry, there is remarkably little doing in
the way of increased Protection, even when
State Ministries propose to reduce hours
and output by one-twelfth and thus make still
further additions to the w r age bill.

Elective Governors.
The British authorities are to be presented,
as soon as possible, with “a memorial,
apparently originating in N. S. Wales, and
signed by all the Labor Governments, re-
questing that the export of minor Excellen-
cies from Britain to these parts shall cease,
and that the States shall in future have
“locally-nominated” Governors. (’^'o l^ [ u '
nated” is the term used in the press.) The
idea of Australian Governors is wholly coni-
mendable, unless “uncouth crooks ’ get at it
and make dishonest use of it, as they do of
the ballot-box, which is also a commendable
piece of furniture. It is unfortunate that
the referendum isn’t an Australian institu-
tion so that public opinion could demand a
chance to express itself on this and any
other important matter —not a bogus refer-
endum which Parliament can insolently over-
ride, but one of the Swiss variety which over-
rules Parliament. But, though the refer-
endum looms large on Labor programmes, it
shows no sign of being enacted by any Labor
Government, for a definite and absolute ex-
pression of public opinion isn't popular in
uncouth and crooked circles. And the anti-
Laborites, being dull dogs in the mam and
slow to move, have never realised that they
should put it on their programme, and push
it for all it is worth. No solitary anti-
Laborite has even tried his luck with this
matter in the shape of a private member s
bill. In the matter of Australian State Gov-
ernors, everything depends on the method
of appointment. The Canadian system, under
which the imported Governor-General creates
the minor Excellencies, is an improvement
on the old Australian method, inasmuch as
it saves some money and gives local men a
chance. But it is not enough of an improve-
ment to be worth while. Tim makeshift pro-
position that the Chief Justice should play
a double part is wholly obnoxious, for the
judiciary should stick to its ow r n trade and
keep out of politics. A third method is that
the State Excellency shall be the creation of
the State Ministry or the Ministerial caucus,
and be its‘ sordid and corrupt creature if it
happens to be sordid and corrupt itself. The
situation might be aggravated by treating
him as removable in the same way as an
Agent-General or Director of Finance, so
that an incoming Ministry would have more
patronage to dispose of. The fourth alter-
native is to follow the example of the United
States, and make the appointment for a fixed
term (the U.S. term is two, three or four
years) by popular election. This really
means introducing the referendum idea,. re-
garding which present-day Labor politicians
are very moderately enthusiastic in theory
and exceedingly shy in practice. It makes
the appointment as clean and as free from
suspicion as it can be made. In fact, with
the State voting as one constituency the
business might be much cleaner than a gerry-
mandered State election, and the political
color of his Excellency might be an unplea-
sant reflection upon that of the Ministry.
In keeping with its reputation for stodge, the
Victorian composite Ministry has decided
to stick to the perishing tradition of the
little, imported sub-viceroy, instead of join-
ing in the new movement—-with the proviso
that everything suspicious must be left out
of it. But a Government which can’t see
the advisability of annexing the referendum
idea as its own is all stodge.

The Commercial ’Plane.
When the Armistice released hundreds of
Australian flying-men who had performed
mightily in the air of France and Palestine*
the prophets foresaw the people of this coun-
try, spurred by the example of the returning
soldiers, taking to the safer and less con-
gested element in increasing numbers. But
the hopes stirred by exhibition stunts in the
various cities failed to materialise, and the
pessimists said the air business was over-
boomed. A couple of private concerns strug-
gled into being, one owing its existence to
the enterprise of Major Brearley, who, after
taking Perth’s breath away with hair-raising
feats performed in a war-worn Avro,. settled
down to the humdrum trade of carrying pas-
sengers and mails along the nor’-west fringes
of the Sunset State. Another concern, col-
loquially known as “Qantas” —the Queens-
land and N.T. Aerial Services—is doing
quiet but estimable work in the North-East.
The monthly story of its romantic Sittings
is lost in the din of the cities, where the crowds
prefer the romance manufactured and canned
in Los Angeles, Cal., but up in the immense
territory where it operates Qantas has lost
none of its adventurous appeal, and at the
same time has become an important factor
in the spread of civilisation in the Back-
blocks. The punctuality it maintains oyer
its big hops of 577 miles from Charleville
to Cloncurry, and the 496 miles from Cion-
curry to Camooweal and back again, Should
rouse furious envy in the breast of earth-
bound ones waiting humbly in their lords
for the traffic cop to notice their existence.
Judging by the times recorded a delay of
five minutes in a flight of half a thousand
miles is considered a matter for censorious
comment in the North, where commercial
men take extended business tours in . the
taxis of the company, and surgeons flit a
hundred miles on Saturday morning to per-
form an operation and flit back in time to
put their little bit on the favorite in the
first race of the local meeting. The success
of the aerial pioneers indicates that Aus-
tralia is an ideal continent to fly over. A
recent cable stated that aircraft firms in
England, where the roads are getting so con-
gested that motorists are looking skyward,
are being inundated with orders for aerial
runabouts of 20 to 60 horse-power which can
be housed in an ordinary garage, manipu-
lated by any person reasonably sober and in-
telligent, and which cost between £6OO and
£9OO, But in Australia the N. S. Wales
section of the Aero Club has come to. the
melancholy decision to postpone its light-
aeroplane competition scheduled for Novem-
ber for the reason that no light aeroplanes
are being constructed in the State.

A Matter of Bedclothes.
An impression seems to prevail that the
British coal-miners struck a fresh chord on
the industrial lyre when they recently held
up the Government with a threat of all-
round stoppage, and extracted a subsidy —
for the current financial year, anyhow—to
eke out their wages. The threat might be
more or less novel, but the subsidy isn’t so
new as it looks. In the struggle to preserve
the fetich of Freetrade as nearly intact as
possible, during a time of stress for which
that old unseaworthy joss is quite unsuited,
a lot of things have been done that would
have been denounced as “unsound” in better
days. When the much-applauded reduction
of working hours took place the number of
miners employed to produce the same quan-
tity of coal increased by 23 to 24 per cent.
Then items like these began to appear in the
Estimates:—-
1920- Coal-mines Deficiency £15,000,000
1921- 3,000,000
1922- ” ', 5,000,000
1923- ” ~ 1,500,000
1924- „ ~ 500,000
Apparently the idea was to taper off the
voluntary contribution until the great in-
dustry, understood to be one of the props
of empire, could stand up unpropped once
more. But it has been explained very clearly
to the Baldwin Ministry that in future the
subsidy is expected to be permanent and
compulsory. So there is an idea that the
poorer mines which have closed should be
kept closed, and that the industry should
be limited, like Queensland sugar, to make
the burden and loss of it as small as pos-
sible. The coal dole isn’t the only mystery
in the new finance of J. Bull, for there
are items of expenditure such as these: —
1919- Railway Agreements . . £60,000,000
Bread Subsidy .. . . 50,000,000
1920- Railway Agreements, etc. 26,932,000
Bread Subsidy .. . . 45,000,000
1921- Railway Agreements, etc. 30.673,000
1922- ~ „ 33,697,000
1923- „ „ 1,965.000
1924- „ ” „ 499,000
Seems as if the poor old Freetrade gentle-
man was always cutting a bit off the tail ot
his blanket and sewing it on the head to
make the article longer, or paying Is. to
make something 6d. cheaper.

Happenings, Especially in Queensland.
“Solomon Malai-rop” : Job-control had a
busy time recently. The ink was probably
dry, but only through the judicious appli-
cation of blotting-paper, on the seamen s
agreement that they would job no _ more, in
return for which they were to retain all the
advantages of the award which had been
specifically abandoned. And then jobbing
resumed. The Marrawali was held up at
Melbourne on the plea that the chief engi-
neer should not dismiss a pair of unsatisfac-
tory firemen and exercise his right to en-
gage two other unionists instead. The union
claimed the right of appointment, and pro-
posed to reappoint the pair of unsatisfac-
tories. Bulli (N.S.W.) Shire Council pro-
vided work for the local unemployed, but one
of them being sacked the others left and be-
came unemployed again. But Queensland,
as usual, had the most unusual experience.
A railway ganger, being told that his bit of
line was in poor order, demanded his dis-
charge—kept on demanding till he got it,
and so got out of the service. Then he in-
sisted on coming in again, and being em-
ployed as a laborer on the same section and
no other. The insistence being rather un-
accountable. he was refused, but was offered
work elsewhere instead. Thereupon the sec-
tion was declared “black,” all repair was
prohibited, and trains proceeded to crawl
over it at their own risk. The Brisbane Gov-
ernment has spent 10 years in the effort to
be an impossibly good shepherd to its
adherents, and it is now being bitten by its
own sheep. Queensland is in a curious state
of flux just now, some of the conditions
being as follows: —
Employers of labor oil the 48-liour basis are to
have one-twelfth taken off their output by the
introduction of 44 hours. It is also proposed to
make them pay 21s. where they now pay 205., the
extra shilling being for the children’s endowment
fund.
The Government, being a huge employer of labor,
should pay a big share. But it can’t do what il
expects other employers to do (in fact, its entei -
prises pay no taxes and are so rottenly run that
they require unprecedented subsidies out of othn
people’s taxes), so its share will have to be added
to the private taxpayer’s load.
Between 1919 and 1922 the number of employees
in Queensland factories increased by 1258. The
increase in the hands employed in sugar-mills was
1491, so other industries showed a decline. The
sugar business is a monopoly created by Federal
law, and the price (a high one) is fixed and made
proof against competition. Employment returns for
the sugar refinery are not published, and the mill
figures do not appear in the Year Book for later
than 1922. On the returns, the common or garden
employer doesn’t look a promising subject for more
taxation.
The subsidy required out of taxes to keep the
State railways going has averaged £1,200,000 p.a.
since 1915. I can trace no similar shortage south
of the Line. It is expected to be more when
44 hours gets fully going. And despite all this the
disrepair is dreadful, likewise the untidiness and
procrastination.
Possibly as a reward for the 44-hour boon th
staff at the grelat Ipswich railway workshop's has come
out on strike. The cause assigned was the manage-
ment’s objection to the holding of meetings, or of
too many meetings, in working hours.
In the biggest Sydney share list the leading
Queensland copper-mines get a mention. One of
them paid its last dividend five years ago, but that
is Mount Morg an, with a Government subsidy. Some
last dividends were paid seven years ago, and one
12 years ago. People of the Paul Freeman variety,
with a free ’hand and Bolshevik tendencies, did a
lot to wrecl: the copper industry, especially at
Oloncurry, officially described as “the and
most extensive cupriferous area in Australia.” It
perished .’in Sts rich infancy. One reason why \ ic-
torians, who supplied much of the capital that is
buried There,* lean towards Theodore’s scheme for
stealing the Federal South-to-Nortli railway for n>
State is the dream that it might put new life
into Cion curry.
It may furnish some explanation of the in-
eo’/npetenee ihi Queensland s affairs, and it*
blind and widespread faith m crude Gorn-
niunist superstitions, that the demand toi
t/ie higher education in that part is, in P ro "
portion to population, the poorest in Aus-
tralia, and the Australian record is poor
enough. Australian universities offer educa-
tion which is good, practical and cheap and
they offer it after dark for the benefit of the
wage-earner. A young man who chooses to

A Heritage of Peace.
“Descend into a gold-mine, and no matter how
‘ich it is, you can find dirt it you look for it.
Exactly the same with nations. We have always
looked for the dirt in the Near ■ East, and we have
always found it. The young men of Turkey are as
human as any of us, and like all of us they are
tired of war, and yearn and pray for peace." Let
us shape our policies according-! v.”—Ton Skeyiiili,
( 11. 13/8/’2o ).
Dear Bulletin, —.Air. Skeyiiili. came on
the sample Russian, always a patient, ox-
like, holiday-loving creature, and found that,
after seven years of war, he was willing to
put up with a particularly bad form of gov-
ernment (he always has) rathe'- than fight
any more (he never has fought in his sober
moments unless driven to it. but he is easily
driven). Then lie dropped on the sample
Turk, commonly regarded as a rather objec-
tionable character, and found that, after 12
years of war, lie was also ready for a spell
and willing to let some other Turk take a
turn in tin- trenches. He was going home,
possibly for more ammunition. Then Mr.
Skeyiiili. made the earnest appeal that we
should "shape our policies accordingly,”
though what exactly is amiss with our poli-
cies he didn't state. Australia has one battle-
cruiser at the bottom of the sea, a fleet which
is amazingly small and sketchy even when a
turret ship of the mid-Victorian vintage is
reckoned in to swell the list, and 46 cadet
midshipmen under training at recent advices,
all this to guard and patrol a naval station
which stretches officially from the Equator
to the South Pole. It is reported to have
1703 soldiers permanently under arms, or one
to over 1700 square miles. If we could
"shape our policies” to show more profound
confidence than that in all Near-Easters, in-
cluding Turks, Russians, Chinese, Japanese,
mixed Bolsheviks and sundries, I would like
to learn how. This country needs a call to
arms more than a soporific sermon about a
tired Turk who wants temporarily to go to
bed. Mr. Skeyiiill is hardly right in say-
ing that one can always find dirt in a gold-
mine if lie looks for it. Clean earth and
clean.rock are common, but dirt, in the sense
of something objectionable, isn’t. And
neither Australia nor Europe began the
search for dirt, of the objectionable sort, in
the character of Asia. It was Asia which
came searching in Europe, and whether as
Persian. Ilun. Avar, Mongol or Turk he
brought a dubious and often a very bad re
cord with him, and left a worse one behind.
The British and French made a pet of the
Turk after the Crimean War foolishness,
and British people became so maudlin that
it was the fashion to say Annul, was the
only gentleman left in Europe. Bulgarian.
Armenian and many other horrors wore out
this sentiment, hut it revived when the Young
Turks took over control in 1908. and Britain,
at all events, mamfled again. Then more
years of sporadic massacre persuaded all but
Ihe most hopeless that the polite and plaus-
ible Young Turk was just the polite and
criminal Old Turk over again, and was never
likely to he anything else till the tiger eats
grass. The drawbacks of flic Turk include
lack of a turn for poetry or other forms of
literature, for painting, sculpture, architec-
ture, manufacture, invention, science (includ-
ing sanitary science) or exploration. He
lias no lucid intervals, like the Arab and the
Moor. . There is a remarkable sameness in
the things written about him. Some odd

Remarks like these may be quoted by tin-
score, but anything favorable is difficult to
find. The Turk has been a great dc-
populator; most of flic cities lie stole
have lost population under liis management,
even in peace time. To some extent he seems
to have succeeded in depopulating himself,
for the race is supposed to be stationary or
decreasing, which is a good tiling. At Very
latest advices. Abdul was reported to have
120,000 conscript troops under arms as a
peace establishment, and to he doing his best
to acquire a fighting fleet and a good air
service. That doesn’t put him in the same
category as Russia, with 563,000 conscripts
under arms, or of Japan, which has about
250,000 men with the colors and 211 armed
ships on the water, but it suggests that he
is doing his best. As Mr. Skeyhili, says,
let us shape our policies accordingly—in pro-
portion to our means, that is. No one should
despise a possible enemy, even if the enemy
gives provocation by despising him first; anil
though the “Near East” may say it is meek
and peaceful and only wants to go home and
be at rest, it. is safer not to be too literal
about it. —Yours, Solomon Malaprop.

The Navy and V.D.
“Ex-R.N.”:. In the article headed “The
Forbidden Subject” (B. 6/8/’25) it is stated
that “there was a brief period about 15 years
ago in the history of J. Buli/s fleet when
commonsense threatened to triumph over
conservatism, but the crisis passed.” With
few exceptions, present-day naval medicoes
are skilled V.D. specialists, as they well may
be, seeing that the study, prevention and
treatment of such diseases has been for
years their chief task. Anyone who has
served in the British Navy during the last
decade knows that their efforts have met with
considerable success. Here are some of the
methods employed: (1) Frequent lectures to
the ship’s company. Amongst other things the
men are instructed in the use of prophylac-
tics, and (in case of infection) specifically
MR. THOMAS WALSH IN HIS FAMOUS IMPERSONATION OF BRITANNIA.
warned against the dangers of concealment.
(2) Free issue of prophylactics to liberty-
men. . In most ships a supply of these is kept
conspicuously on the sick-bay table, and any-
one who wishes may help himself. In any
ease, they are always obtainable from the
sick-bertli attendant, and signatures are not
demanded. (3) Official warnings of the pre-
valence of Y.D. in ports which are notori-
ously affected. Places such as Malay-street,
►Singapore, where the disease is known to be
rampant, are usually placed out of bounds,
and a naval patrol stationed in the area to
prevent sailors from patronising infected
houses. Short of stopping all shore leave, it
is difficult to suggest further means by which
the naval medical authorities could assist
in fighting the scourge. It is true that men
who contract V.D. in the navy arc punished
even nowadays. They forfeit their pav
whilst in hospital and—if their health is
seriously impaired—they risk losing their
job as well. But these are the penalties
not of immorality but of laziness and
neglect—far more serious naval crimes. In
nearly every case the punishment is fully
merited, for statistics show that over 95 per-
cent. of naval ratings who contract syphilis
and gonorrhaea have simply been too indolent
or too stupid to avail themselves of the
remedies literally thrust upon them.

A MX. correspondent, who writes to The
Bulletin to ask for its assistance in finding
the address of the promoters of a “consul-
tation” to which he has been a regular sub-
scribe]-, forwards a result slip which is an
interesting document. It is quite natural
that there should be no imprint—printers
naturally shy at identifying themselves with
an illegal affair —but a more amazing piece
of effrontery is the appearance of a replica
of the Australian coat-of-arms at the head
of the document. A note adds that these
sweeps are “Recommended by the sporting-
papers throughout Australia.” The sport-
ing paper that started to recommend any such
illegalities would soon find itself in trouble.
The sweep is stated to have been drawn at
"the M.D.C. (Rub rooms,” Melbourne, but
The Bulletin’s Melbourne office has so far
failed to find the premises. Statements
like those in the circular are obvi-
ously meant to impress people in
Maoriland and wherever else the affair
has its agents; it is hardly likely that the
documents are circulated in Australia itself.
Some snide sweeps certainly do pay prizes
at times—they can hardly afford to neglect
doing so in the interests of future business;
but everything about them is so vague and
dubious that it is almost incredible that
warnings such as this should be needed.

When the Vic. Police Force is reformed
under Blamey, who will take over command
on September 1, the preposterous rule that
the detective branch shall be recruited only
from the uniformed police will surely be
modified, if not abolished. Naturally, for
reasons of impressiveness if nothing else,
police patrols should be fairly husky—though
the tricks of jiu-jitsu have made size of less
value and knowledge the better weapon.
There will always be rough-and-tumbles in
connection with summary police action, and
in these weight tells. The detective branch,
however, works with more finesse; it de-
mands more agility of mind than of body,
and it can always summon a squad of huskies
and batoneers when its finessing time is
over. Brawn and brain go together some-
times, but it is too much to expect that
brawn always includes brain. Many a phy-
sical weed could outwit the hooligan able to
blow him over in an actual encounter. The
parallel applies also to the enemies of
society; the higliest-grade criminal is a
planner rather than a doer of crime, and
weight does not count with him as it would
with a plain manhandling thug. Criminal and
detector of crime start, therefore, fairh
level. With each it is brain that tells. And
it isn t brain the force has asked for. If
in the mass of recruits are found a
percentage of superior intelligence, with
enthusiasm and ambition enough to make
good detectives, that is the State's good
luck. Luck is the only selective agent.
Australia has made a small opening
tor its young men by means of the Papuan
public service cadet system—a useful move for
which Posterity may live to be grateful. It
lias the opportunity to make another by
raising crime detection to as attractive a
status. Victoria, of which State the whole
poli.ee system is about to go into the melting-
pot. lias the chance to be first to take this
opportunity by the hand.

"Macquarie Street" : Australian interest
in Spahlinger is perennial, and many
Federal Labor members would he quite wili-
ing to spend a quarter of a million or so in
furthering his experiments, provided they
were carried on in Australia and we got
the free use of any discoveries. One can
only hope these members and those who are
inciting them will not be disappointed. At
present the profession, with all the goodwill
in the world—l can swear to that in my
own case—can find little reason for opti-
mism. Spahlinger, on his visit to London
in June to confer with the Health authori-
ties at the request of five Parliamentary doc-
tors who had visited Geneva and been much
impressed by bis methods, merely repeated
what the Continental Press has been reiterat-
ing for months. lie was hard up, had an
insufficient staff, could not produce vaccines
in bulk for eight months, had only partial
serums (a complete serum did not exist),
and no new cases could be taken at Geneva
until circumstances changed and funds were
available. Hi l cut no ice in London, and nil
he got from the Health Minister was a pro-
mise to investigate his cure if he supplied
the vaccines and serum. In his treatment
both vaccines and antitoxic serums are used,
the chronic cases getting the former, the
acute eases the latter. His trouble seems
to be his inability to produce a complete
serum owing to the number (over 20) of
toxins which he has isolated. He used each
toxin separately to immunise horses and
obtain a corresponding specific antitoxin: a
complete serum would have to contain all
these partial antitoxins, and an antibacteri-
cidal. serum as well. Nevertheless, the sub-
ject is so interesting and of so great import-
ance that no stone should be left unturned
to get a complete investigation.

At a time when there appears to be some
chance of finality and uniformity being
reached by the States in connection with the
observance of Anzac Day, some well-meaning
people arc throwing a spanner into the works
by suggesting, as a feature of the celebra-
tion, a commemoration inarch of returned
men in uniform. The average Digger hates
a street march, however eager he may be
to oblige adoring mothers and sisters and
pageant-loving ineligibles, and nothing is
more ghastly to him than a march of men
partly uniformed and partly in mufti—and
each year mufti must be more in evidence.
There was something inspiring in the recruit-
ing and pre-embarkation marches, despite
the boyishness of the marchers and the baggi-
ness of their “issue” khaki: it even extends
to-day to the citizen trainees, more boyish
and more baggy than ever. But the boys
of 1915-17 are now men with ten and eight
more years of weight and girth, round which
uniforms meet with difficulty. Few Diggers
have retained complete their demobilisation
kits; only enthusiasts or Volunteer Reserve
men, lime-lighters and padres have kept their
uniforms moth-free and V-pieced to accom-
modate the passing years. An Anzac march
must therefore be nondescript and unrepre
sentative if uniforming is projected, and 'a
pale imitation of an Eight Hours' or St.
Pat.’s procession if done in civvies.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It is coining. Already one X'.SAV- Assem-
bly member has remarked that, if they have
to spend the daytime listening to tull
speeches, they ought to be paid extra tor it
(loud applause). Up and down the lobbies
it is argued that, if Parliament is a tuil-
day job, then members can’t do any more
private work than Ministers used to, and
they ought to get the same pay or there-
about. Incidentally, under this day-sitting
arrangement the position of Ministers is
anomalous. They must neglect one job or
the other. As a matter of fact, they are
neglecting the legislative. Blven the Pre-
mier isn’t in the House half the time.
In ten years of Uabor administration, the
Queensland taxpayer has had to dig up over
12 millions to finance his Government rail-
ways, which ussed to return profits. Among
his rewards for this expenditure arc dilapi
dated lines and rebellion among the stall.
Last week portion of a railway was de-
clared “black” by one of the utfiops because
a ganger had been sacked, and( the men in
the Ipswich workshops, having been refused
5 p.c. more pay for 8-'. p.c. less” work, went
on strike. In the affair of the . ganger the
union secretary points out that “lie spoke
to the Commissioner in the same way in
which he spoke to the men on MisMength,
and was dismissed in a fit of pique. ’ This
particular dispute has been settled by the-
reinstatement of the ganger, and it: is now
expected that he will be appruntedi a Com-
missioner.
The figures in the Federal Budgdf drew
attention to what looks like a surprising drop
in taxable incomes. For 1922-23 there were
three fewer taxpayers with over £lOO,OOO a
year, the, drop being from 23 to 20. These
are now all companies, the individual pluto-
crat of this size having vanished. Taxpayers
with between £lO,OOO and £lOO,OOO dimin-
ished from 71.8 (mostly companies) to 07U.
'l’he ones with £lOOO to £lO,OOO fell Horn
28.119 to 26.282, and those with from £5OO
to £lOOO wore reduced from 49,147 to 34,221.
•As for ; tlie mihb£ fry there “ were
1921-22 and only 408,501 in 1922-23. This
looks astonishing enough to create a doubt.
Yet one thing is certain : every time the Com-
monwealth or State “nationalises an mdus-
try it loses a taxpayer, and when it has
nationalised everything it will have no tax-
payers left. And it seldom makes enough
profit now, or any profit at all, to compensate
for the loss of taxes.
If the foreshadowings arc correct the unem-
ployment allowance in N.S.B . is to vary
from 255. per week in the case of a bachelor,
spinster, childless widower or childless widow,
to £5 10s. in the case of a married man with
10 children aged under 16, which should be
about the maximum. Therefore it looks as
if it would pay better to be an unemployed
aged 59 years and 11 months than an old
age pensioner aged 60 years and one month,
and unless one can fill both characters it
will be best to remain young and skittish.
To a large extent the l ie. State Employees
Superannuation Bill, submitted by Treasurer
Peacock to the Assembly last week, is a
copy of Hughes’s Commonwealth Act. llie
highest pension obtainable is £416 and the
lowest £52. Approximately 30,000 _ perma-
nent officers will benefit, including civil ser-
vants, teachers and railwaymen ; the police
are already catered for by the Act passed
after the 3923 strike. Provision is made for
twilighters—those who joined the public ser-
vice between December 24, 1881, and Decem-
ber 31, 1884. and those who entered the rail-
way service between November 1, 1883,'and
July 1, 1884 —whose retiring allowances,
ranging from £312 to £96, will be debited
wholly to the taxpayer; with this exception
the scheme is a £ for £ proposition. Some
of those concerned are not satisfied, and are
engineering for more. The coolest sugges-
COMPENSATION.
“A piano importer appearing before the Tariff Board claimed that if the importation of German
pianos was to be stopped, the importers who had their money invested in the business should be eompen-
sated in the same way as the people interested in the liquor trade were compensated toi the clo sing
of hotels.”

tion of all has conic from a chap who re-
tired 10 days before July 1. 1024, the date
to which benefits are to be retrospective;
he wants the Government to give him 11
days’ pay so as to bring him within the
scheme. And if the gentleman remains on
deck till a less-Labor Government comes in
he will doubtless be accommodated.
Though he produced most laughs, no mem-
ber came out of the N.S.W. censure debate
with a more damaged look than Kay, of
North Sydney. It wasn’t because he announced
his support of the Labor Government: as
an Independent he had a right to do that.
What put the smudge on his virgin page
h?s hitter : eo Nationalist
party, after all he had done for it m light-
ing Communism, placed him only 10th on its
voting list. The inference is that, if he had
been put second or third or even fourth or
fifth, he -would have spoken and voted against
the Labor Government instead of for it. It
he -wasn’t prepared to do that, why should
he complain of being put low down on the
list?
During the last ten months, to go back
no further, Walsh, the imported president ot
the Seamen’s Union, has taken a leading
part in (1) the lawless hold-up ot seiei, ,u
steamers under charter to the Commonwealth
Government. (2 ) the strike of wharf-laborers
in every Australian port; (3) the strike of
seamen and tugboat hands employed by the
Westralian Labor Government; (4) the
long succession of .job-control strikes on Aus-
tralian steamers; (5V the strikes of wharl-
laborers ships’ painters and dockers over
the handling of the chartered steamers afore-
said • and (6) the strike which followed the
deregistration of the Seamen’s Union. In
most of these operations he had the active
assistance of .Johanson (imp.), the gentle-
man who can't remember whether he used
to be Dutchman, Finn or Svfede, and Garden
(imp.), the Moscow pilgrim. And having
thereby damaged Australian industry to the
extent of hundreds of thousands of pounds,
and brought the laws and constituted autho-
rity into contempt, the three unwhipped
mob-leaders are directing a strike of British
seamen designed to strangle the export trade.
The lily-fingered Commonwealth Govern-
ment is now reported to be brushing the sleep
out of its eyes and wondering whether it isn t
a ease for deportation. In countries like
Maoriland, : S’Africa and U.S.A., where the
tradition still lingers that it is a Govern-
ment’s business to govern, Walsh, Johan son
and Garden wouldn’t have been suffered for
ten days, let alone ten months.
Heads are being counted in the Speck's
Parliament in preparation for a salary-grab.
The idea is to start with what is called “a
living allowance to members whose homes
are not in Hobart,” and to extend the “living
allowance” in due season to the Hobartians.
There will be the usual tramear growls and
daily-paper philippics, but the public has
a short memory in these matters.
The N.S.W. unemployment insurance fund
is to be supported by contributions from
employers and employees, with a probable
contribution from the Treasury. The' latter
probability looks pretty large, especially as
the unemployed are ready (nearly 21,000 for
certain) while the fund isn’t. Ini those
industries which are run by companies and
have available balance-sheets, profits in many
cases are small and risky just now. When
the 44 hours reduces the output by one-
twelfth without reducing wages, and the
pension contribution is added, complete or
partial shutting up is likely to reduce the
number of contributors of both kinds, and
increase the claimants at the same time.
Then there will be a tendency for people to
come into the State and qualify by six
months’ residence, and no tendency to go out
and disqualify. And the more who come in
the easier it will be to be unemployed. Tin*
man who runs unemployment insurance suc-
cessfully must be no poor financier.
The 200 acres of Yarra Bend ( Vic.) land
which it is now proposed to use for purposes
other than accommodating the mentally-
afflicted is estimated to be worth just on a
quarter of a million sterling. The Town-
planning Association is going bald-headed
for making the area an attractive public?
park. If thrown open for settlement it would
be rushed, specially by speculators who would
like to make the public, through the State
or municipalities, pay for communication by
rail, tram and road. Pinniger, Clark and
Ritchie, three public officials, are sitting as
a board to advise the Government as to the
best thing to do with the area.
“Oxnicad”: “Stellsby” (B. 13/8/’25) is
right about the British Government having
the power, under the Royal Pension War-
rant of 1919, to cut down Imperial pensions
next April. It is a fact that by Article 24
a 16 per cent, reduction could be made —in
the U.K., anyhow—in accordance with the
fall in the cost of living, and that the tax-
payer would be saved 64 millions thereby.
But he need not have the faintest appre-
hension that such a step is contemplated
by Winston Churchill or anyone else in
authority. The insinuation has already been
pilloried as a lie designed merely to influence
votes at by-elections; the Minister for Pen -
sions has specifically announced that “the
Government has decided that under present
conditions no reduction in the rates of any
disablement pensions and allowances for offi-
cers, men, widows and dependants shall be
made next year.” So far from reducing such
pensions, indeed, or leaving them capable of
being reduced, the Baldwin Government pro-
poses to stabilise them permanently.
Scientific man Le Souef, of Sydney, has
introduced broadcasting as a new element
of civilisation in Central Australia, and has
met with various things, including “sheep
country of high quality, with grass for miles
and miles of saltbush of many varieties.”
Also he met the great main road across
the continent, and reported on it: —
The north road from Oodnadatta for 100 miles is
not very impressive from a stock-carrying point of
view. It is known as gibber country, or stony
country. This is intersected by stony creeks, which
cause the only disability to motor travel. These
c-reekbeds comprise not more than 1 per cent, of
the road travelled, and yet are the cause of practi-
cally every breakdown on the road... . The creeks
could easily be made passable by scooping out a
crossing and Ailing it in level with stones, large
at the bottom and small at the top. The expense
of carrying out this work is hardly worth considering.
.... These roads might bo made easily possible for
motor traffic.
But the well-tailored Administration at Mel-
bourne is too busy appoiting another batch
of Commissioners and secretaries to scoop
out anything, and no one else has any
encouragement to scoop. In fact, scooping
is at a discount.
The Freetrade and Land Values League of
Victoria wrote the other day to the Prime
Minister and demanded (
on behalf of the primary producers, and of the
great body of men and women who enjoy no State
subsidies, that the capitalists and workers in com-
paratively few secondary industries shall no longer
be allowed to enjoy privileges which cannot be shared
by all.
Up to June, 1924, the landowners of Vic-
toria, some of whom are altogether too apt
to mistake themselves for primary producers
instead of mere rent collectors, had made
£29,000,000 by selling laud to the State for
soldier settlement. Almost simultaneously
the Bond (Camperdown. N.S.W.) cotton-
spinning mills were explaining that it would
almost certainly be necessary, under present
conditions and the new 44-hour conditions,
to close down, after losing thousands, be-
cause there is no duty at all on cottons im-
ported from Britain, and the Briton works
12 hours per week more than the Australian
for a much smaller wage. So the Labor
member combines with the importer and the
big landlord in denouncing the manufacturer
as a “capitalist,” even if he has lost all his
money in the effort to run an Australian
industry; and the big landlord combines
with the rich importer in demanding that
the manufacturer’s • iniquitous Protection
shall be abolished even when he hasn’t any.
JOHN DUNDERHEAU'S ENRMN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“When any nation entered upon a scheme for
defence, he declared, it could be reasonably assumed
that the enemy had been visualised. —Port 0/ a
east heap of rubbish put forward by frank Anstej,
M.H.R., to prove the lack of any need for an Aus-
tralian Defence scheme.
John Dunderhead, Esquire, one day took to himself a
home, . ,
Wherein he gaily stover! away, as hoes enrich a
comb, ,
The honey of his gathering years, the riches he t.
acquired—
Such gold and silvery frippery,
And solid stuff, like '.£ s. d:,
As he had earned with sweat and tears before he
had retired.
So great a wealth he planted there and lived so much
alone, ,
His friends besought him have a care ot perils
unbeknown.
“A gun,” they begged, “for your defence; a dog
lest you’re surprised.”
“What awful rot,” replied John D.,
“To talk about defence to me
Against a foe —Good Lord, you’re dense!—not even
visualised!
“Has one of you, I ask you fair, so mucji as ever seen
These bandits bold that raise your hair on papei,
book or screen?
And are you frightened children, then, or reasoning
mortals, tell?
The man that needs defence, you see,
Meeds first to know an enemy—
That’s logic quite within ; your ken, as Anstev
says so well.”
But, sad to tell, upon a night when hidden was the
moon.
There came a certain stealthy vyight, who counted it
a boon
I'nvisualised, indeed,,to ionic, unvisualised to go,
With all that he could feel or see
Of goods belonging to John D.;
lie blew no bugle, beat no druni, that most unethic
foe.
John Dunderhead at break oi day surveyed his
ravished home ;
His eye was bleak, his face was ! grey, liia wits in-
clined to roam,
For little there was left to him of all that he h&Ci
prized;
Of gems and silver cutlery
And goodly wads of £ s. d.,
The treasury was mighty slim that now he visual-
ised.

“I ash you for the last time, young lady, arc you going to give that silly fellow up?”
"Oh, thank goodness, Dad, there’s an end, then, to that stupid question!”
“Hasen”: In a recent divorce case the
respondent husband listened unmoved to the
recital of several acts of cruelty and violence
charged against him. But the statement that
he had once threatened his wife with a plate
of curry drew from him the indignant retort,
“I’m much too fond of curry for that.” This
husband reminds me of Joe. something of
an identity in a Queensland town on the
North Coast line. Joe was gathered in by the
police on suspicion of being concerned in a
hotel brawl, which had resulted in quite a
lot of damage to a visiting commercial. A
number of vile things were charged against
Joe, mistakenly as it turned out ; there were
insinuations of a murderous assault with a
bottle on a defenceless man and some kicking
in the ribs after the other fellow was down
and out. Such slurs seemed to worry Joe
not at all; indeed, being somewhat weedy,
he was apparently rather proud that they
should think it possible he could have dealt
so vigorously with a burly commercial. But
in his telling of the tale one fonl lie always
swept him to the very height of scorn.
“Blime,” he said indignantly, they said J
threw me beer over him. Me heer!”

chase Willigobung, and smiled later on
when the Repat. Department gave him a
fatter cheque for a slice of it than he had
paid for the lot. As he closed the bargain a
brass-liat remarked: “Yes, I like the land,
and I like its appropriate aboriginal name!
“The Listening-Insect”: For the first time
owners of the humble crystal set in N. S.
Wales heard 3LO, the big broadcasting sta-
tion run by Buckley and Nunn in Melbourne,
the other night. The divertisement was re-
layed from Farmer’s Sydney station, and on
its voyage from the Cold South picked up
some queer additions suggesting that it had
been strained through a Walpurgis naelit on
the way. Nevertheless it was interesting as
a curiosity, and will raise hopes in the
breasts of those who thirst for the bizarre that
some day we may hear in our own homes wal-
rus bones thudding on polar bear-skin drums
in the Arctic circle. The experience has
already befallen that remarkably successful
Sydney amateur, Spencer Nolan, jun., who
heard gramophone records put on by the
Macmillan expedition in Greenland, and was
just exchanging the time of day across Asia
I—or was it round the other way?—when he
was rudely interrupted by a Maori!under
talking on the same wave-length. Probably
the Eskimos will have nothing new to tell ns
about music, but it will be a fresh sensation.

“Wallaby”: I remember cne Digger who
succeeded in convincing the medical officers
that he was mentally afflicted (B. 13/8/’25),
although I have never been able to convince
mvself that he was. It was at Larkhill,
Salisbury Plain. Every day, wet or fine,
when reveille sounded, he would repair to a
trough in the horse-lines with his piece of
twine and a bent pin. Apparently ■ uncon-
scious of the notice bestowed upon him, this
“compleat wangler” would sit there with that
expression of quiet purposefulness which one
instantly associates with the angler born.
At last his reward came; he found an
embarkation-ticket on the end of his line.
*• * * *
“O. Ren”: It was the fortieth anniversary
of their wedding day. In a pause of the in-
cidental celebrations I took the opportunity
to congratulate the old man. “You have been
very happy to have had such a wife,” I said
with the profound air of one who makes a
happy remark. “Well, yes, I suppose so,
be assented ; then he leaned over and mur-
mured confidentially, “but I often think I d
have been more comfortable if I d just liau
a housekeeper.”

“S.T.S.”: Long ago, The Bulletin pub-
lished some helpful Advice of mine to Young
Murderers. The main plank was Run like
the dickens to the nearest policeman; lie is
your best friend.” If Benetos, a Greek of
Peterborough (S.A.), had heeded it he might
now be at liberty, instead of beginning a
long sentence. Vlachos, another Greek, dis-
appeared, and was found buried in a rlibbish-
tip; the deed was easily traced to Benetos
and Tsontsos, who had cleared out to Adel-
aide and were arrested there, the latter m
hospital badly hurt. Half-way through the
trial. Benetos spoke up boldly. ‘ I killed
A SIR WALTER WANTED.
OLD LADY : “I cannot get off, conductor—there is a pool of water in the way.”
CONDUCTOR : “Sorry, Mum, but we can’t wait till it dries up for yet.
him,” lie said; “it was in self-defence.”
Both men agreed in their story that Vlachos
was a quarrelsome acquaintance who fell on
them in a dark place, nearly killed Tsontsos,
and got quite killed himself; after which
Benetos lost liis head, hid the body and
assisted his damaged friend away to the city.
It was a sound story, but came too late, the
concealment and flight being unaccounted
for. The jury finally called it manslaughter
in the case of Benetos, acquitting the other.
Judge Napier gave a 10-year sentence, but
took the edge off it by charitably suggesting
an appeal to the Government for a remission
“if it should seem in any way too severe.”
* * * *
“Riwaka”: The taking of small Australian
animals for mascots on ships of the Ameri-
can Fleet reminds me of an incident in the
early ’eighties. A kangaroo was sent to some
relatives of mine in Scotland. On arrival
it was placed in a low stone-walled enclosure,
from which it escaped and hopped off across
country. A search party sent after it came
to a recently dug potato field. The door of
a neighboring cottage was barred and win-
dows closed, but the voice of a man within
praying could be heard. The pursuers
knocked on the door, but Donald, the tenant,
only prayed harder, and the voices of his
two sons' joined in the supplication. The
party then called him by name, and pre-
sently a window was opened a little way,
and a scared face peeped out. The door was
hastily opened, and Donald came out greatly
excited. He warned them that they were in
grave danger, as tlie Devil was abroad. He
went on to tell how he and his two sons
looking up from their potato digging saw
Satan leaping across the fields towards them.
There could be no doubt it was he, for two
horns stood erect upon his head, and a most
cnor-r-r-mous tail swung behind him. They
ran to their cottage and sheltered behind the
spiritual defence of prayer, but, being cauti-
ous Scotsmen, took first the. precaution of
barring door and window behind them.
“Hamer”: Some stiff-lipped pride and
plucky self-reliance were found behind the
trim garden of a small Prahran (Melb.)
habitation the other day. A man had been
taken to hospital in a fainting condition, and,
starvation being suspected, the tip was given
to some welfare workers to look up his home.
They discovered that the man had been out
of constant work for six months, and only
secured an occasional casual job; neverthe-
less starched curtains had been kept white
in the windows, the garden had been main-
tained neatly, and the three children had
gone to school decently clad and clean,
although there was little to eat but mil kl ess
porridge and bread and dripping. And even
after this had been elicited the would-be help-
ers could not reconcile the brave little woman
to the notion of accepting anything m the
nature of charity, although she eagerly asked
their help to secure a job. She would have
to work to keep her children, she explained;
besides, there would be something to pay
for her husband in hospital. When told that
he would receive free treatment she persisted
that she could not bear the idea of his being
regarded as a pauper. The pair are not
Scotch either, but both Australians of the
third generation.
NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO.
CLARENCE: “We had a mind-reader at our
house last night!”
CLARA: “Poor chap, he MUST have been
bored!”
“Retsam”: Certainly Britain has nothing
to learn from Uncle Sam in the matter of
handling ships. If our recent visitors had
been British I think the flagship would have
left Sydney first and steamed out in such a
manner as to say “That’s how it’s done. Now
follow.” In 1913 part of the British Meet
was visiting Germany. When they got to Kiel
Canal a very heavy fog descended. A German
cruiser was sent out to escort the visitors in,
and, not finding them, reported that the Bri-
tish Meet must be standing off until the fog
lifted. When the fog lifted the visitors were
anchored in Kiel.

OFF TO BOHEMIA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“After abruptly throwing a pot of potatoes at
him one evening in their home at Kirribilli, his
wife left, declaring that she preferred a more
Bohemian life.” —Petitioner in Sydney Divorce Court.
She wilted, like a lily
Upon the stalk, in stilly
And sober Kirribilli;
There alwaj's seemed a vague
Sensation of anaemia
About it to Euphemia;
She hankered for Bohemia,
Her spirit yearned for Prague.
She wanted to disport her
Where there’d be more to court her,
Say, in the Latin Quarter;
Conventions were a plague.
She scorned the wives and maters
Who blithely cook pertaters
For masculine curators
And sighed instead for Prague.
She panted to achieve her
Fair share of foie de vivre.
If she could feel the fever
She wouldn’t fear the ague
(That word, of your compassion,
Pronounce in Yankee fashion.
A poet needs must ration
The rhymes that click with Prague).
She tired of languid virtue.
The spuds—mayhap they hurt, too —
Hit on the part referred to
By Scotties as the “craig.”
And she? Do Czechs behold her
And sullen Slovaks shoulder?
Ah, no! She sought an older
And somewhat airier Prague.

We all have a different outlook on things in general. Opinions

“Coppertop”: Touching the bunks and
other comforts provided for American sailors
(B. 20/8/’25). When our transport, the
Persic, tied up in the Hudson River (New
York) to take on board 800 Yanks, we
were delayed for a fortnight while car-
penters fitted up bunks in the two forward
holds, with spring mattresses and eiderdowns
complete. We had hammocks. Some dirty
weather in the Atlantic nearly filled the
ship. The hammock sleepers were high
and dry, while the bunk sleepers were
drenched.

“Alastor”: It happened lately in a small
town in Western Queensland. The presiding
J.P. shut his eyes and nodded —nodded so
hard that presently the solicitor who had
been plodding along for about an hour
stopped short, and in a loud whisper to his
learned friend at the table exclaimed: “Oh,
what’s the use—the old fogey’s asleep!”
Whereupon the Bench lifted its head and
said : “Are you quite finished, Mr. Sixenate?
If you are, the old fogey, who is now quite
awake,* will proceed to sentence your client
to 14 days’ imprisonment.”
* * * *
“Sixenate”: Among actions set down for
early hearing in the Victorian Supreme'Court
is one brought by a man for breach of pro-
mise of marriage, a form of litigation that
always has a special interest for womankind,
partly because of its rarity. The plaintiff
is a manufacturer who requires £250 as a
solatium for hurt feelings, and £245 more by
way of special damages, including the money
paid for new clothes (apparently a man also
needs a trousseau), the engagement-ring, fur-
niture and sundries. The most sensational
“breach” suit brought by a man in Australia
was one in which an impecunious boundary-
rider sued a wealthy Molong (N.S.W.)
squatter ess for jilting him. The jury con-
temptuously gave him a verdict. But
another turned-down suitor, fairly affluent,
A BIT OF OLD MING.
“Rebecca says she’ll never marry. She’s going to remain an
ornament to her father’s house.”
"Precisely! An antique on the shelf!”
who sought to recover from a poor
girl the cost of his unsuccessful love-
making, putting down even liis disburse-
ments for flowers, cab-hire and chocolates,
was less successful. The Court decided that
the meanness he was not ashamed to parade
showed that the girl was perfectly justified
in altering her mind about his suitability as
a life-partner.
“X.D.”: The casual Australian sometimes
turns up in petticoats. One such, a widow
in the first year of matrimony, was staying
in her sister’s house when her child was
born, and left the
infant there one
morning to go and
look for work. A
job was offered her
as attendant to an
elderly woman with
a mental kick, and
it was stipulated
that she must en-
ter on her duties
at once. She did
—jand the sister
with whom the
child had been left
heard nothing more
of her for six
years. She had
spent several
months with her
charge on a Vic-
torian station, and
then gone to Syd-
ney, where, her em-
ployer dying, she
had secured a fresh
position as com-
panion to a lady
travelling to Eng-
land. Arrived there
she re married, and
returned with her
husband to Aus-
tralia. At this
stage she appears
to have remember-
ed her child, and,
repairing to her
sister’s hose, came
on the youngster
playing outside.
When the sister
came home she
found the child
missing, and imme-
diately reported
the disappearance
to the police. Three
days later the
mother was ex-
plaining that she
had intended to write, mentioning that she
had taken the child, but had overlooked it—
just as, apparently, she had overlooked the
necessity of writing during her six years’
absence.

“Henry Pannikin”: The luckiest man of
the moment is named Sargent, and he lives
on the N.S.W. North Coast. He was driving
a car near a steep embankment at Kyogle,
on the Richmond, when something went
wrong and the ’bus plunged over the preci-
pice. It turned three somersaults and then
landed on its four wheels at the bottom. The
man with the luck was thrown out at the
first somersault and escaped with a wrenched
wrist and a few scratches. The car was
scarcely damaged.
* * * *
“Wingella”: The idea that the N.T. nigger
is a worthless fellow, only fit to be kicked
off the earth, got a severe jolt at Darwin
early in August when the motor-launch Don,
under contract to supply the lighthouses,
came back to the wharf in a crippled condi-
tioii and flying her
flag at' half-mast.
Soon after leaving
the lighthouse at
Point Charles the
crew had b e e*n
found to be suffer-
ing from ptomaine
poisoning. The
Chinese captain,
in bringing the
ship’s head round
too hastily, lost the
jib and the fore-
mast overboard. He
and two aboriginal
members of the
crew were pros-
trated by the poison,
and the jSole re-
maining member
of the crew, also
an aboriginal, little
better than a my-
all, had sufficient
energy, pluck and
eommonsense t o
keep the engine
running and to
bring the boat
safely into harbor.
And it was lie, too who had hoisted the flag
with the idea of bringing assistance as
quickly as possible.
* * * *
“Globe”: Re sailors' superstitions (B.
13/8/’25). I was on a ship which took a
corpse aboard in Melbourne for burial in
England. On leaving Adelaide a black cat,
whilst playing on a lifeboat, was thrown
overboard by a gust of wind ballooning the
canvas covering. Three days later the gong
fell. (This always means disaster. The
THE PERFECT DIVORCEE.
“Well, anyhow, you never asked any of your husbands for alimony ,
did you?”
“No, Cuthbert —when I was through with them they hadn’t any.”
Matunga’s fell just before she was sunk by
a bomb from the German raider Wolf.)
Then the sailors noticed there were no rats
to be seen on the ship. All ominous signs.
Three men deserted at Durban and five at
Capetown. The ship then joined convoy with
three other vessels. Two of them were tor-
pedoed,. and ours, having lost her escort and
almost helpless, was apparently at the mercy
of a German submarine, when a British aero
Plane, arriving in the nick of time from the
English shore, bombed the Hun boat and
forced it to submerge. That ship is yet a
peaceful carrier on the coast. m
* * * w * .
“Staten Land”: There is a mystery asso-
ciated with the days of the clipper runs to
Australia which will remain
as insoluble as the Marie
Celeste riddle. In March,-
1861, the Black Ball clipper
Marco Polo ran into an ice-
berg as she was rounding the
Horn on her way from Aus-
tralia to England. As she
pulled off those on board saw
on the top of the iceberg a
figure with one arm folded
under his head. He was
dressed like a seaman of tlie
better class, with a rough
blue pilot-coat. He wore no
hat, and his long, iron-grey
hair was seen moving in the
wind. By his side was a
small boathook, to which was
tied a piece of red cloth. His
very features could be seen
through a telescope as the
Marco Polo lay hove-to for a
while. Then she ran to Val-
paraiso for repairs, leaving
the dead man in sole posses-
sion. Was he the survivor
from some ship that had
earlier crashed into the iceberg
and foundered? Or had a
vessel been wrecked on some Antarctic
coast, and had he been carried out to sea
when the iceberg broke away?
* * * *
“X.D.”: In a dash-away from a pursuing
John Hop a Melbourne larrikin, looking over
his shoulder, crashed his head into a steel
post and dropped unconscious; the pursuer
tripped over him and banged his head on
a pavement that was almost as hard as the
post. Both went to hospital with concus-
sion. This recalls a chain of accidents which
once happened in a Surry Hills (Sydney)
affray, _ only there was more poetic justice
about it. A sergeant of police, hard pressed,
sent his fist to the jaw of a man who was
about to fell him with a picket. This diverted
the course of the makeshift weapon, and it
struck the bottle-brandishing arm of a second
i aggressor, nearly breaking it. And the bottle,
5 flying off at a tangent, caught a third at-
> tacker on “the point,” knocking him out.
! * * * •
“Pick”: Telepathy or what? When we
were building the Nadjidgomar (N.S.W.)
dam, Tom Styles suddenly dropped his shovel
and left his line of clay-stampers. In reply
to a peremptory question by the ganger he
could only say that a sudden overpowering
feeling had come upon him that he ought to
be beside his wife, who was at the time in
Victoria. Just then the afternoon joe-time
whistle sounded. The next forenoon a tele-
gram from a Melbourne doctor arrived for
Tom ; at 3 o’clock on the day previous his
wife had died in hospital. The time coin-
cided with that of our knock-off for smoko.
* * * *
“Torreken Farm”: It isn’t only the hon-
orary justice who needs an occasional rap
over the knuckles for the questions he per-
mits to be asked. Recently I was waiting
my turn as witness in a traffic case at a
Melbourne suburban court. A lad was
charged with assault, and his solicitor elicted
the fact that his client had never before been
in trouble. “Rut,’ asked the prosecuting
police-inspector, in cross-examination, “have
you at any time done anything which might
have brought you into court if you had not
been lucky?” The P.M. let the preposterous
question pass; I wondered how many persons
could have answered it with an honest
“Never!”
* * * *
“11. K.” : Here’s the long arm working over-
time again. During Uncle Sam’s recent visit
a Balmain (Syd.) artisan met a stray Ameri-
can sailor in that smoky suburb. Over a
drink he told his new acquaintance of an
octogenarian Celtic mother keenly interested
in the Fleet, but debarred by age and
infirmity from seeing the ships. As a small
solace would the visitor alter his course and
have a few words with her? “Sure!” agreed
the good-natured gob. The pair adjourned
to a back street, and the Yank subsequently
turned out to be the son of his venerable
hostess’s younger sister, who had migrated to
the U.S.A. from Co. Galway just on half a
century ago, and of whom the elder member
of the family had lost track for 25 years.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: There are curious
and compelling fashions in pub names, and
even Carlton (Melb.) is going to have its
Hotel Ritz. The name is to be given to
the licensed house which is to rise on the
spot where the Rifle Brigade Hotel has
stood for something like 83 years, although
the old inn did not get that name until
the establishment of the city rifle-range in
the vicinity made At the handiest place for
volunteer marksmen to wet their whistles.
The old tavern was closely associated with
the early activities of Carlton, and various
district cricket and football clubs were
formed in its parlors.
* * * *
“Percy P.”: Behold how groat a fire a
small spark may kindle! The police, called
IT TOOK HER DIVA HEX TO CATCH HER.
CLAUDE : “She’s a hummer —all the men are running
after her!”
MAUDE : “No doubt—but it’s the women who ore running
her down!”
upon to interfere in a recent disturbance,
were surprised to discover that the occasion
was a silver wedding, and the persons mainly
responsible for the rumpus were the happy
pair. Dad had just been telling the assem-
bled suburban company that the 25 years of
matrimony had been unalloyed bliss, and.
encouraged by the smiling complacency of
Mum, was following this with his version of
how they came to be married, when Mum
interposed with her version ; and in the en-
suing argument some hot things were said.
Presently one son was offering to “knock the
head” off his old man if he didn’t become less
insulting, while other sons took dad’s part.
After sorting things out, the police, in view
of the happy occasion, decided to take no
further action.
AUGUST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
August runs with feet a-gleam,
Shining in the dewy grasses
Where the thoughts of springtime dream
Till the sleep of winter passes.
All the changeful winds at play,
Now soft lulled and now a-bristle,
Whisp’ring “Spring is on its way,”
Round her new-green garments nestle.
Coldly blue the sky may glow,
On its wide, deep bosom floating
Wisps of cloud as white as snow—
Sunlight in the air is gloating!
And the vicious storm that dams
Rain on high is but the grieving
Of the winter—-she who slams
Angrily a door in leaving.
On the face that grief has worn
Once again comes shyest laughter,
Hinting on the cheeks forlorn
Of the smiles to come hereafter.
With a tender, wistful dream
As the winter’s shadow passes,
August runs, her feet a-gleam,
Shining in the dewy grasses.

Though the steelworks were kept going with-
out a break during the 12 months, and though
production beat that of any previous period,
the plant was not w’orked to its full capacity
and isn’t likely to be while an inadequate
tariff favors foreign manufacturers working
with much cheaper labor. Wages, says g--RL
Essington Lewis, are 80 p.c. of the costs m
the steel industry, and no matter what im-
provements are made in methods, overseas
competitors have an advantage that can only
be met by High Protection. In the wire
section, for instance, competition has lately
cut the output of rods to 1500 tons a week,
whereas normal capacity is 2300 tons, in
the struggle to make good, important addi-
tions and improvements were made at the
works during the year. Rolling-stock was
increased, and another steamer purchased
from the Commonwealth line, making five
now employed in the business. Two basic
open-hearth furnaces were added to the
seven operating, and a new and more econo-
mical electric-power plant installed, which
supplies all the requirements of the works.
Increased production was largely due to
these additions and improvements, plus, of
course, the uninterrupted working. As a
result the blast furnaces produced 358,861
tons of pig-iron compared with 306,258 tons
in 1924. Other products showed better

There was a larger output also of motor-
spirit and solvent naphtha, production being
1,023,291 gallons of the spirit (773,958 gal-
lons in 1924), and 92,594 of the naphtha
(52.918 in 1924). Steady progress is being
made in the development of the co.’s coal-
bearing areas at Maitland, and more land
has been acquired near Newcastle for ex-
ploiting the Borehole seam, which gives the
best coke-making coal. Within the next 18
months the co. should be winning' its own
supplies.
In April Rylands Bros. (Australia), Ltd.,
was absorbed, 215,433 B. H. Prop, shares
being the price. The works adjoin the Wara-
tah plant. Regarding subsidiary industries
Lysaghts has extended its plant, and is tak-
ing more sheet-bar; and it is hoped that this

other comparison the co.’s recent progress.
There is a visible improvement since 1923

down to new capital.

ness, plus £11,539 for coal lands, moved capi-
tal forward by £226,972. The following

Highly profitable prices for lead and spelter
brought the mining side of the business
back into the picture, although, the „reat
old mine at Broken Hill being now little more
than a shadow of what it was, Block 10
was bought to help things out. Output
was 126,191 tons of ore, compared with
36,392 tons for 1924 and 142,458 tons in
1919 —the last important year. lor the
12 months 115,299 tons of crude ore ana
tailings were treated for 7113 tons of jig
lead concentrates. In the flotation plant
(Bradford process) 108,523 tons of tailings,
etc., were treated for 16,674 tons lead con-
centrates and 15.261 tons zinc ’trates. About
500 tons per week of slime from the Central
were treated, while regular deliveries of ore
came from Block 14. Just what the activity
at the Barrier represented in profits is im-
possible to say: all operations are bunched
when it comes to earnings. Working account
disclosed “sales of products and stocks on
hand, etc., £4,624,894”— easily a record. This
shows how gross profits, also a record, com-
pare with preceding years:—

That makes net profit for the year £380,~d0.
For 1924 it was £257,989; for IJ-2,
£103,300; for 1921, £351,331; 1923 showed
a loss of £106,086. As in the previous year
there were taxation refunds and over-provi-
sion (amounting to £64,015). which were
written into Profit and Loss. Taking advan-
tage of that further windfall the directors
wiped £75,000 off the Broken Hill mine as
special depreciation. In all, £288,518 was
written off; at least, that much was shown.
But it may be guessed that the management
patched any part of the structure that was
suspected of weakness. In fact, this Column
suspects that the Board took advantage of
the good year to make liberal provision,
while what appears to have been an unusu-
ally heavy amount was expended on plant
and improvements and charged to working
account.
Shareholders had no divs. from August.
1921; when one was declared in April last
it was taken as an intimation that the
directors were satisfied it could be main-
tained so long as conditions did not move
adversely. But much has to happen yet
before either shareholders or employees can
feel safe. Even where unmanufactured iron
and steel can compete against the foreign
articles, disposal of many products will still
be governed bv the granting of adequate
Protection to industries which use the
B.H.P.’s manufactures. As for the other
branch of the business, all that can be said
is that the areas controlled at Broken Hill
have known reserves sufficient, at recent
rate of extraction, for seven or eight years.
Without a doubt the mines still hold much
larger quantities of ore than that estimate
would suggest; but workable reserves are
governed by market values, and, though pros-
pects look good, he would be a bold man who
would prophesy on that point.

There has been nothing opulent in it for
shareholders from the beginning. Gift issues,
an ordinary feature of most of the other cos.
which operate along the Australian coastline,
have never brightened N.C.S.N. Co.’s lot. But
there has been an uninterrupted chain of
divs. ——S p.e., 9 p.c. and latterly 10 p.c.; and
reserves have steadily mounted, making the
div. surer and lifting it a point now and
again. Reserves of the introductory table
consist of £140,589 insurance and repairs
account, £82,500 equalisation reserve, and
the undistributed balance of £2OBB. Ten years
ago reserves totalled £64,234. It is. reason-
able to assume that the first-mentioned is
accumulated profit. The insurance part or
the reserve has not been drawn on when
there have been losses of the co. s vessels,
full cover obviously being taken from ordinary
underwriting sources. The repairs part of the
reserve likewise seems merely a title: each
year the Board informs shareholders: ‘ ioar
ships are in good order, and are covered by
insurance.” Even when the co. had to foot
a heavy bill for alterations to comply witn
the new provisions of the Navigation Act
no incursion was made into the account. As
reserves amount to almost half of paid capi-
tal shareholders are well protected.
Hitherto each year has seen a sum added
without comment to the insurance and re-
pairs account. Last year the reserve was
undisturbed. Additions in recent terms have
been • 1924, £2500; 1923, £9000; 1922,
£3613; 1921, £15,600; 1920, £11,105; 1919,
£22,115. During the 12 months there were
several important moves. The whole of the
ships, plant, etc., of Langley Bros. 8. 8. Co.,
Ltd. (in liquidation), was purchased; the
1000-tonner Bonalbo arrived and was placed
in commission; the Yulgilbar and Ter ran ora
were sold; the Kinchela was chartered lot
the Commonwealth Government’s Northern
Territory service; the Tyalgum (on order)
was launched at Port Glasgow; and another
light-draught vessel was ordered. Balance-
sheet figures reflected the changes :
Dee., Dec., June, June,

The net expansion on the year in the fixed
assets (the amount knocked off for deprecia-
tion is not specified) w T as £32,091. But liquid
assets were less by £13,472 and sundry credi-
tors increased by £16,044. Nevertheless, the
change had the effect of bringing fixed
ussets to a point £30,305 in excess of
paid capital. Of the liquid assets cash
alone was greater than the total out-
side liabilities, there being as well
Government stock, book debts, shares m other
cos. and stores (and the excess cash) amount-
ing to £164,557. That is a very snug posi-
tion. The North Coast railway has doubt-
less affected earnings; on the other hand
there are advantages accruing to the
co. from increasing settlement, for the car-
riage of produce and commodities in general
by water is still the cheaper.

Increases in the prices of certain ingredients
affected last’ year’s profits. Experience shows
that the co. has found it impossible to govern
that factor, and a recognition of the fact by
investors is necessary when considering the
scrip. Moreover, the return is relatively
smaller than in some of the earlier years. In
1915 paid capital was £189,398; net profit,
£33,105; in 1918, capital was £221,599 ; pro-
fit £29.663; on May 2 last capital was
£300,000, so the £29,966 was not nearly so
good as the other years quoted. But the
position now is much stronger. In 1924 the
accounts were cleared of £40,000 of goodwill
which represented (presumably) the amount
which for 35 years had formed part of the
item • “Original purchase at cost from the
firm of Swallow and Ariell of freehold lands,
buildings, machinery, plant, etc., including
goodwill, £145,500” ; and assets were re-
valued by two outside firms. Last year, net
additions to property amounted to £l7,lbb
and to machinery and plant £17,30U, an
indication that the co. is developing its busi-
ness and keeping its plant up-to-date. Other
balance-sheet movements were as follows (in
the case of the 1914 and 1923 figures good-
will is assumed to be £40,000 and fixed assets
are less that amount) :
1914. 1923. 1924. 1925,

Book debts, etc. 50,759 82,349 92,732 87,940
Cash, etc. . . 355 1,139 981 600
Liabilities showed an all-round increase, and
that is not surprising in view of the reduced
trading profit, and the necessity to finance
improvements and additions to plant and
property and to carry stocks heavier on the
year by £12,000-odd. The financial position
is solid; debt amounting to £146,040 is
secured by more or less liquid assets aggre-
gating £208,913. Capital is m 100,000 £1
6 p.c. cum. prei's. sharing point for point with
ords. beyond that figure, and 200,000 ords.
of 30s. paid to £l. The prefs. are well
secured, there being net tangible assets with
a book value of £408,104 equal to £4 Is. 7d.
per share. The margin between last year s
profit and the amount distributed was rather
narrow. Although reserves are substantial
the profit-earning capacity of funds, as the
introductory table shows, is variable, being
governed by the prices of the commodities
used in manufacture. Whether that factor
can be controlled is not yet evidentlast
year’s decreased profit suggests otherwise.

The CO. lias lately got its finances on a better
basis but still has plenty ot troubles, hoi
the last two years gas has been displaced bj
electricity in the city, but expansion in the
suburbs has to a great extent offset the loss
The Municipal Council also ruled out the
co.’s tar, but a new treatment has removed
the cause for complaint, and the director,
now “look forward to receiving large orders.
A third groan is given because of the inci-
dence of the Gas Act. In September last
the price was reduced, after review, by three-
pence; that operates for two years, hour
months later the co.’s coal was increased
2s 6d. per ton, which means that share-
holders will have to carry the £lO6O which
the increase represents. Sales ot gas, resi-
duals, etc., were £1471 less on the year, lh«
financial position is comfortable ; debenture
debt is £13,000, and sundry creditors £2356.

[n its 37 years of existence this old co. has
built up reserves which make it a compara-
tively easy matter to pay substantial divs.,
and total funds had to earn only 8f p.c. to
pay a 16 p.c. dividend. Reserves were
not neglected, the year’s additions be-
ing a bit more than 4 p.c. on paid
capital. On April 30 liabilities amounted
to £746, to meet which were cash and
Commonwealth stock totalling £4642, with
book debts representing a further ±2845
and other assets written down to £30,021.
Capital is in 27,452 £1 shares paid to 15s. 6d.,
and on June 30 there were net tangible assets
equal to 2Ss. lid. for each share. The co. is
largely dependent for profits on imports, and
until Australian politicians come to light with
a tariff that really protects, Latrobe’s earn-
ings are not likely to be curtailed to any ex-
tent.

Mallet’s,* Ltd. (Sydney), manufacturers

approached the market for £30,000 of 9 p.c.
prefs. The issue was fully subscribed. There
are 129,973 fully-paid £1 ordinaries and 4500
paid to 15s. Both prefs. and ords. are now
listed on Sydney Stock Exchange. This, the
first balance-sheet made available, shows a
net profit for the 12 months ended April 30
of £9082. Divs. for the prefs. absorbed
£222 and 9 p.c. was paid on ords.. To permit
of the payment and to enable provision to be
made for taxation, reserves were drawn on
for £2424. Goodwill is included among the
assets at £22,682, and reserves on April 30
were £3681, which meant that, prior to
appropriations, £19,001 of capital was not
represented by tangibles. In the circum-
stances the Board can hardly be accused of
ultra-conservatism. The directors state that
“the property, plant and machinery are in
good order, adequate depreciation has been
allowed, and stock has been conservatively
valued.” Apart from a mortgage of £2466
secured on the freehold, the co. owed £28,099
on April 30. Creditors, however, were well
secured, there being liquids and semi-liquids
with a book value of £96,471. In addition
were freehold, leasehold and plant, in the

London-controlled Wiluna Options Syndi-
cate has increased its capital from £20,000
to £50,000 and placed some of the new shares
in the West. The co. recently exposed 4-ft
of 395. 6d. ore at 300 ft. down in the lluna
mines, and proved the lode by costeens to
have a length of nearly 3000 ft ou the sur-
face. Satisfied with the extent of this d ,
posit, the co.’s experts are now experiment-
ing at Kalgoorlie. Whether, m existing con-
ditions, 395. 6d. per short ton can be made
to pay depends, in some measure, on tin;
result of these experiments. The ore is com-
plex, both arsenic and antimony being con-
stituents, and these minerals almost invari-
ably present difficulties in gold-extraction
processes. No doubt, concentration will be
the first stage of treatment, as it is known
that a high gold recovery can be achieved
as concentrate. After that, treatment of
concentrates on the spot or exporting them
to eastern States or Europe for final treat-
ment will have to be considered. Cost of
transport is against the latter method, but,
on the other hand, the arsenic and antimony
contents are thereby more likely to be thor-
oughly recovered and rendered saleable.
Profitable production of these would help
considerably, and Wiluna requires all the
help it can get. One ton of arsenic and one
of antimony shoiild return between them
£lOO. While treatment costs will be high,
mining costs should be low. _ No mistakes
should be made with either mining or treat-
ment, otherwise whatever chance there is of
making a success of the big Wiluna lode will
be lost.
* * * *
Brilliant Co. (W.A.). after having spent
money like water in baling, sinking and
cross-cutting, is now nearing the lode at
370 ft. Owing to a continuous heavy inflow
of water, the co. has had a rough passage,
and, even if the reef be struck as expected,
much has to be done before profits are
sighted. Main drives have to be extended
north and south at the 370 ft. level, and stup-
ing operations advanced before a regular
supply of ore for treatment can be main-
tained. Meanwhile, a small tonnage will
be available. Previous owners of the mine
treated 20,000 tons for a good profit from
the three higher levels, so the tonnage to be
anticipated above the 370 ft. level can be
fairly accurately estimated. Incidentally,
former owners derived considerable advan-
tage from the gold premium.

Gold values in Hansel Mundy bore, drilled
with the object of proving the continuation
of the Radio reef at Manxman (W.A.), w 7 ere
about the lowest on record. Supporters of
Hansel Mundy are finding solace in
the fact that diamond drills often disclose
results that are directly the reverse of the
real thing. They instance the recent case
of the Boulder Perseverance, whose drill
disclosed 9oz. values. The “Percy” has been
chasing those values with a crosscut ever
since, but with no luck.
* * * *
“O.B.”: Companies like Ives Reward
and Mararoa (W.A.) should be asked to
explain. Both have broadcast from time
to time stories of highly-payable values, and
both have boasted more than once of what
their achievements would be when the mill
started. Well, the mill has started, and so
far results have not only fallen far short
ot anticipations, but are running sharehold-
ers into debt.
* * * *
Bullfinch Proprietary (W.A.) is short of
funds, and is making a strenuous effort in
London to raise more. Some time ago the
co. took options on the half-drowned Glad-
some and Sand Queen mines at Comet Val§,
which to date have proved expensive, and to
add to the co.’s financial troubles calls have
not come up to anticipations.
Of £8704 expended by Freney Oil Co.
(W.A.) during the half-year ended June 30,
about a fourth represents salaries and direc-
tors’ fees, and most of the balance outlay
on boring. At the present rate of expendi-
ture, plus an expected £ for £ Commonwealth
subsidy, the co.’s cash resources should last
about two years. Meanwhile, the Board
cheerily informs shareholders that the last
seepage struck in boring was considerably
greater than any previously encountered, and
that the capping of sandstone overlapping
possible oil strata has been penetrated. Plow-
over, even this, coming on top of other opti-
mistic reports, has failed to revive a down-
and-out market.
* * * *
Morning Star (Vic.) soaked up £5690 of
gold won last half-year and then had to
admit a loss of £12,400. The co. has an
o.d. of £6785 and owes £2272 to sundry credi-
tors due to this heavy weather in the moun-
tains. The sporty crowd that trail after the
Morning Star pay calls as cheerfully as bets
when they can’t spot winners at Flemington.
Accordingly they are backing a strong pro-
gramme of boring and other work at the mine
even when the battery is idle. Peacock lias
been asked for a £ for £ subsidy, but lias
turned a deaf ear. Now' a number of the
stopes are handed over to tributors, w T ho
do a bit better than earn wages. Manager
Godden has sorted, sampled and driven all
ways at 400 ft. and north at 600 ft., but the
shoots either pinch to a thread or fml to
stand up to the mill. Some work is being
done south at 600 ft. and 700 ft. on the dyke.
All this is in new r country. Tests also are
being made on a run of quartz off the winze
below 700 ft. and at 920 ft. in the hope that
something will be caught, but so far there
has been nothing worth while. All this is
work of the best type, but it eats up cash.
.* * * *
North Mt. Farrell ore reserves could gen-
erally be looked to for more than 8200 tons
down to No. 7 level. Six months ago the
management reported 18,924 tons. with
the sink of 100 ft. to No. 8 just finishing.
Now they have just cut the lode in the chan-
nel at 234 ft. from the plat. As in the same
six months some 11,000 tons went to the
mill it is time something was hit. Until
driving is done to show how lead and silver
contents go, North Farrell w 7 on’t be able
to enthuse over the strength of even- pro-
bable” ore. The mine lias been a decent little
show. On a paid-up capital of £66,000 it
has shed divs. of £81,930, and has accumu-
lated £28,000 in reserves. Even after pro-
viding 2s. last half-year it has cash £595 <,
ore on hand £6OOO, and stores and sundry
debtors £12,566. That isn’t bad consider-
ing all the nasty knocks the co. has had since
it was first fathered by the Innes clan.
A surprise may turn up in the Macintosh
section, where prospecting is going on in
the locality of the old Kemps tribute, but
no little stranger has shown up just yet.
Naturally Owen Williams doesn’t intend to
go slow on the job of sinking to No. 9 level,
but the outlook would have been more cheery
could he tell what awaits him at No. 8.
* * * *
Calls and gold have kept the flag flying
at Central Ajax (Vic.) because little more
than pot-shots have been taken at various
points off old workings between 425 ft. and
640 ft. This is because all the vertical shoots
are beaten out or thoroughly tested. There
may be a block or two where the old miner
has missed a flat make. It is on the gamble
that manager Lake may unearth one that
Ballarat puts up an occasional threepence.
* * * *
George J. Gray has been appointed mine-
superintendent of Mount Isa, Ltd., and will
take over in October. W. H. Corbould will
remain on the field for a time.
* * * *
Vegetable Creek, Ardletlian (N.S.W.),
put through the battery 917 tons for four
weeks and recovered 6} tons concentrates,
thus far below 1 p.c. This is bad enough, but
underground there is no change except for
the worse. In Smith’s workings No. 2 ore
pipe dipped away till its pursuit was aban-
doned ; and No, 4 pipe thereabout is still of
good grade, “but the ore-body is smaller.’
Poor ore is the verdict elsewhere.
* * * *
Another Flagstone is on the stocks. Be-
fore the issue of a prospectus, West Flag-
stone (N.S.W.) went to registration at the
end of last week. L. P. Collins, of Tent
Hill, is the vendor of the 20-acre lease
directly adjoining the Flagstone on the west,
and the grounds for vending the area may
be summarised in that the Flagstone lode has
been picked up within a few feet of its
western boundary, and crosscut for 16§ft.
without either wall showing. What is more
important, the values are said to be 8 p.c.
oxide. About 10 chains to the north another
lode Bft. wide runs through the lease. The
prospectors have tunnelled 60ft. into the hill
on this, and won a fair amount of tin oxide
with a hand plant. According to a report by
C. R. Mackenzie, of the Flagstone, “there
are a few tons of ore stacked on the surface,
which will pay well to crush, as the pros-
pectors were unable to treat ore lower than
20 p.c. with their handinill.” The co. is in
60,000 10s. shares, but of these 25,000 paids
and £2500 in cash go to Collins. After this
big bite there are 35,000 contribs, of which
25.000 at ss. are being put out, and 10,000
held in reserve.

“General Oil Seeker” writes: —
Every visiting geologist is penning a valedictory
address to the search for oil in Australia, just as
though the flying surveys of Clapp, Wade, Strevens
and co. had settled the matter. Despite reports and
dashes and raids by motor-cars over trackless deserts,
across swollen rivers and right through basaltic
mountains, it is still open to question whether the
query has been answered, “Is there any oil in
Australia?” Twenty boreholes for petroleum have
been drilled in a continent with an area of 2,971,581
sq. miles, and yet Dr. Wade in his report to the
Federal Government has the audacity to say there is
no hope. With the exception of the S.A. Oil Wells Co.’s
Robe borehole, 4504 ft. deep, there is no hole deep
enough to give any scientific evidence against the
existence of petroleum in Australia. Water bores
do not count. Dr. Wade’s valedictory consists of a
series of knocks at the chances of getting oil, apd an
elaborate eulogy on the oil-shale beds of N.S.W.
J. E. Carne’s monumental work on the kerosene
shales of N.S.W. was a classic 20 years ago. It'
Dr. Wade had managed an oil-shale mine and
distillery his report might have been acceptable.
But he has never claimed that experience. The oil-
shale industry is not a poor man’s game nor a one-
man game; it is a highly complex undertaking
requiring large capital, extensive technical ability
and thorough organisation. It demands the applica-
tion of the principles of mining, civil and chemical
engineering, quite a varied combination of qualifica-
tions. To press the claims of the coming Australian
oil-shale industry before the claims of the existent
petroleum-mining industry is rank treason. Oil
prospecting will take tens of thousands of pounds
to do it properly. The establishment of the oil-shale
industry that is sure to come some day calls for
millions sterling. Saying farewell to our petroleum-
mining industry is like saying good-bye to a baby
and hoping he’ll grow up to be a fine big man,
nourished on plenty of advice and a very little solid
scientific food.

Waihi (M.L.) shareholders have just said
“Yes” by an overwhelming majority to the
Board’s query put to them per postcard
whether they desired an immediate return oi
ss. per share of capital. Most of the scrip-
owners are what the London Board calls
“colonial shareholders” —Maorilanders, with
a few Australians. To save time the Auck-
land office counted the votes and cabled the
result to London. The ballot followed on
some plain speaking about the smallness or
divs. (2s. a share for the past four years)
in comparison with the size of reserves,
chiefly in first-class securities, but earning
only about 4 per cent. Waihi holders believe
in liquidating some of their investments while
the going is good. Both the mining and the
financial position are strong. Gross return
from ore crushed last year (£390,000) was
£40,000 better than any year since 1913,
when double the tonnage was put through.
The past three years have seen 600,000 tons
taken out of the mine and another <OO,OOO
tons developed—three years’ supply for the
mill without considering possibilities during
that period. Developments last year indeed
were gratifying, particularly at No. 7 and
other upper levels, but the lowest, No. 10, is
being pushed vigorously also. Present return
of capital will be the second of its kind, and
will distribute £125,000, reducing the share-
value to ss. only. The directors’ idea was to
postpone it until 1931, when the co. is due
to receive £212,500 from the Government on
account of the Hora Hora hydro-electric
scheme. For years tlie .Board lias been look-
ing for fresh properties, but it can t be
accused of wasting money on wild cats. It
has an interest in a property called the Rio
Grande in Central Manitoba (Canada), be-
lieved to have possibilities.

“Ivawarau” chips in :
Re Alex. McGeorge’s letter (B. 13/8/’25). I know
the Kawarau River, and I say that the general descrip-
tion “raging torrent” is fairly applicable. It is
quite true that at the point of confluence with the
Clutha the river is “fairly smooth-flowing”; but
along the greater part of its course of 30-odd miles
it is a turbulent stream, and to suggest, as Mr.
McGeorge might by the casual reader be thought to
suggest, that its possibilities have been exhausted
by the dredging of its lower waters and the scratching
of its banks, is without justification. The public
was expressly told that Maoriland Kawarau was a
gamble. The Kawarau claims in which Australians
are interested extend practically from north to south
of the river.

Rawang Tin (F.M.S.) has
a definite move to convert its 2,000,1HX> 3s.
4d. shares into 240,000 20s. shares. There
is so much" red tape surrounding an opera-
tion of this kind that finality in the direc-
tion of shareholders’ consent will not be
reached till the end of September. The
suction cutter dredge has been placed m
commission again, but nothing has been
heard of the Min. electric plant for several
weeks. Shares have been hoisted beyond
35., on the promise of a shilling div. when
the reconstruction is completed.

Tanah Biji, a Straits Settlements show in

quoted at 555. on ’Change. The latest news
from the front affirms that Penman had
examined several properties on its behalf,
and that one of these may be taken if boring
tests justified that step.

From S. Africa: The Public Directorship
Bill, which provides for the appointment of
Government directors on every mining co.
board, is now before Parliament. If it be-
comes law the Government director will have
free access to all books, and must be given
due notice of all meetings of the board or
boards of which he is a member.. He will
not however, be held responsible in law for
any default of the co., or be liable for the
co’s actions. He will be bound to secrecy,
but must report to the Minister for Mines,
who will have the right to make public any
information so given or order an inquiry
into the affairs of the co. concerned. The
bill imposes a fine of £5OO on any co. with-
holding information from the Government
director or failing to notify him of board
meetings. The penalty for violation of
secrecy by the Government director is ±lOO.

The Australian Shale Oil Corporation is
pushing on with developmental work at
Catrobe (Tas.). An experimental plant of
10-ton capacity has been installed, and con-
tracts have been let for the supply of the
necessary parts for the first of the five 200-
ton Bronder retorting units, which is ex-
pected to be completed by Christmas. Sixty
men are at work. The Tasmanite seam
varies in thickness from about 4ft. to 7ft.,
and has been proved by boring over a wide
area. In lease and freehold the co. has
secured at least 8.000,000 tons of shale, esti-
mated to contain over 30,000,000 gallons.
The seam will be worked by tunnels dipping
at a grade of 1 in 12, and power will be
supplied by the north-western arm of the
State hydro-electric.

Jim Mathews, ill enough to have been in

almost forgotten when lie was a hale man,
sticks still to his Parliamentary job in a
way that is heroic. He spends most of his

into the House, and he misses very few
divisions. The grip upon life is inherited.

‘T.W.W.” on a Trollope and two
Dickenses:
Fred Trollope, a son of the distinguished Anthony,
was my boss during part of the 40 years I spent in
the service of the State; he was chairman of N.S.W.
Land Boards for many years. A tall, well-set-up
man with a silvered beard and a slight lisp, ex-
ceeding courtly in manner, he had literary tastes,
and was a warm admirer of his father’s
novels. In this he was a great contrast to
the sons of Dickens. In ISSS and onwards, when I
was Crown Land Agent in Bourke, Edward Bulwer
Lytton Dickens (Ted) was appraiser of runs for
DICKY FOSTER. M. H.K. for Wakefield
(S.A.).
the Government, He did his work well and was
never ruffled or perturbed by the relentless, cross-
examination of the solicitors or the squatters. He
wore a scanty dark moustache, was slight in build,
and dressed carelessly. There was a touch of reserve
about him, but he was generally voted a good chap.
Any reference to his father’s works only bored him.
When I was in charge of the Orange Lands Office in
the early part of this century, I renewed my acquaint-
anceship with his widow, who was then manageress
of the Club House Hotel. Alfred Tennyson Dickens,
Ted’s brother, was rather portly, with a pleasant
face and genial manner. I heard him lecturing in
the ’nineties on his father’s works; lie did not strike
one as having studied them very closely, but his rosy
complexion, well-trimmed grey moustache and gener-
ally cheerful appearance, made him look an ideal
entertainer, .and Iris recitations were always well
received.
The father of authoress Mary .Grant
Bruce received the call last week. Eyre L.
Bruce was 89; it is 71 years since lie arrived
in Victoria and joined the Government ser-
vice as a surveyor.
W. J. Swan, who retired a fetv days ago
from the charge of the deeds branch of Vic.
Lands Department, entered that section of
the service a week or two before the fateful
Black Wednesday (January, 1878), when
the Berry Ministry, sacked officials in a
wholesale way to spite the Upper House.
Too insignificant to bo noticed by the man

years, 27 of which he put in at the Lands

in weather and communing with the stars.
Another Crimean veteran has been dis-
covered in Melbourne, and this time it was
a joyful occasion that brought him to light.
He is J. A. Wallace, of Camberwell, who
celebrated liis “diamond wedding” the other
day. Wallace did not actually join in the
Crimean argument, but he enlisted for it.
His regiment was sent to S’Africa, and he
got his baptism of fire later in the Indian
Mutiny. lie came to Victoria as an instruc-
tor to the volunteers, and he is still a year
off 90.
Broken Hill lias lost a useful citizen (at
02) in Patrick Ileidy. He left Adelaide for
the Barrier 90 years ago as a school-teacher,
but became an accountant for Kidman, for
the Town Council, and later in his own
office, and at another time was the head of
the Norton Griffiths branch when the Menin-
die railway was being built. He filled in a
busy life with such side-lines as auditing for
the Benevolent Society and other charities
and handicapping for racing clubs.
Melbourne Uni. has waited a long time
for its legacy under the will of David Aitche-
son, who nearly 50 years ago left £lO,OOO to
provide scholarships for poor students, sub-
ject to a life interest for a niece; but the
fact that the niece, Miss Hickman, who died
in England recently, lived to the age of 95,
makes it £27,649 better off. That amount
represents the lady’s savings out of the in-
terest ; and it all goes to the seat of learning.
John Garibaldi Roberts, manager of the

stalled in his grounds is the old ’bus in
which C. J. Dennis prepared “The Senti-

HUDSON SUPER-SIX
Unmatched In Ten Years -Today at the Height of Success
In today’s Hudson, economies possible only to the largest production of
6-cylinder cars in the world, give value advantages never held by any
rival. Never before was its supremacy in quality and price so outstanding.
Greatest of All Hudson Values
Hudsori’s outstanding advantage is the patented
and exclusive Super-Six motor. For ten years it
has steadily advanced Hudson’s position m ever
wider success. Because it embodies a basic su-
premacy so excelling in power,
smoothness and brilliant per-
formance that the costliest cre-
ations in a decade of intense
competition have not dis-
turbed its leadership.
The one issue with Hudson
has always been to give greatest
value for the money. Its lead-
ership is based upon ten year’s
concentration in refining a
great car around the famous
Super-Six principle. Its sim-
plicity has always meant a
lower selling price than is per-
mitted in complicated types.
And no design, however cost-
ly, has been found to excel its
smoothness, reliability and
performance.
All know that higher price can buy no finer per-
formance than Hudson’s* It cannot buy more
brilliant results in acceleration, power or speed*
It cannot buy greater reliability or endurance*
The COACH
Hudson’s invention, and more than
four years’ development of the Coach,
of course, give it exclusive manufactur-
ing advantages in this type. No car at or
near the price rivals the Hudson Coach m
actual proof of value —which is SALES.
Greater economy of fuel,
oil and tires is supplemented
now in a policy and service
which provides replacement
parts at prices that are as-
tonishingly low*

terestedpolicy of ownersatis-

ience,thatown-

Destruction. I consider it absolutely the best means of
rabbit destruction ever put on the market, provided it is
used the right way.”

“I promised to let you know about Calcium Cyanide. I can
say it is all right, and is the best-knowr

“The Rumpus” : On “Jim Oarew’s” story
of two flocks of white cockatoos meeting head on in
the air with a resultant casualty list numbering 30
(B. 16/7/’25), I am sorry to cast a doubt. It is not
right that our ’toos should be put down as brainless
featheied idiots, and “Jim’* should have seen whether
his shotgun had not accidentally discharged both
barrels as the unfortunate birds met. When my
father had his corn patch on the edge of the black-
soil plains at Clermont (Q.), millions of cockatoos
used to visit the ripening cobs. I have seen the sky
white with their wings, and Bedlam let loose with
their screeching. Masses of them frequently met in
mid-air flying in different directions, but never have
I seen one bird come earthward because of being hurt.
* * * *"
. “X.N.0.”: “Maccabee” (B. 30/7/’25) con-
tests my remarks about climatic conditions. After
reading his accusation of “glaring mis-statements’’
I now offer the “Encyclopaedia Britannica” in support
of my memory. This is what I find under “Climate
and Climatology’’; “On 21st December the condi-
tions in southern latitudes are similar to those in
the Northern Hemisphere on 21st June, but the
southern latitudes have higher values of insolation
because the earth is then nearer the sun.” Various
local conditions no doubt tend to modify the other-
wise natural results, but my paragraph started by
sa\ nig that tropical conditions extended further
south than they do north. I was thinking particu-
larly of the Australian summer and comparing it
with places in similar northern latitudes, and I find
my remarks again confirmed: “It may be stated as
a general law that the climate of Australia is
milder than that of corresponding lands in the
Northern Hemisphere.” Also: “The whole of the country
[Australia], excepting the seaboard, lying between
the meridians of 120 degrees and 140 degrees and
north of the 25th parallel lias a mean temperature
in excess of 90 degrees F.” This seems to. fix the
real southern limit of the Australian tropics at
least 100 miles south of Capricorn.
“Ex-R.N.”; \\ hen “Maecabee” (B. 6/'B/’25) says
that the earth is the same distance from the
sun in December and on the first day of the
northern summer—by which presumably lie meant
June—lie forgot that, although the earth’s orbit is
ail ellipse, the sun is not at the centre of the
ellipse, but at one of the two foci. If “Maecabee”
will take a piece of string about 6in. long, make a
small loop at each end, pin the two loops with drawing-
pins about half an inch apart on a sheet of paper
and then run a pencil point round the apex of the
loop of string so as to mark the paper, he will get
an ellipse, the drawing-pins being the foci. If the
sun were at the centre of the figure, it would be
midway between the foci, instead of which it is
at one focus. In June the earth is on the perimeter
of the ellipse at the point where a line drawn from
the sun through the other focus cuts the orbit.
In December the earth is at the other end of the
same line, which is divided by the sun into two
portions, one about 3,000,000 miles longer than the
other. Every statement made by “X.N.0.” (B.
30/7/’2o) and contradicted by “Maecabee” is per-
fectly correct.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: Nowadays a Torres Strait
boy setting off to work on the pearling luggers
usually carries amongst his gear a native leaf sleeping-
mat and a “white-man” pillow. In old days the
braves were not so soft. The T.S. “pillow” was
a head-rest made of wood and had a bar and two
supports. It was about a foot across and nine inches
or so in height. A piece of bough trimmed up and
smootned filled the bill nicely. The two legs were
placed in the sand, and Binghi reclined with his
beau on one side so that his long plastered ringlets
draped themselves over the end. There are not now
many specimens of the old pillow left.
* * * *
"Biroobi”: I wonder what depth would be
considered a record for ants to reach when excavating
their homes. In Central Australia the honey-ants
burrow deeply, often forming their living-room
between five, and six feet below, the surface. The'-

go out at night to gather honey when the pugnacious
varieties of their kind are in bed, and collect a
sweet fluid exuded by certain tiny creatures belong-
ing to the scale family. Having eaten their fill,
they return and store the surplus, after the home-
dwellers have been fed, in the bodies of other
members of the household whose duty it is to act
as honey Jars. Should a drought come, the supply
of honey thus accumulated saves the species from
dying out. These living storehouses present the
appearance of tiny bladders of lard, the thorax and
limbs being scarcely' noticeable in comparison to
the distended abdomen.
THE SILVER LINING.
BILL: “Poor cow you! You're only gettin’ ten bob a day and I’m getting fifteen?”
THE POOR COW : “Yeh but if it comes a wet day, you lose fifteen bob and I only
lose ten!”
“Morob”: Just as animals are possessed
of a specific and distinct scent, by means of which
they are able to detect the presence of each other,
so human beings have their characteristic octor.
The Australian abo. seems to be endowed with the
property of frequently
being able to pick up
this smell, and identify
the owner by it. Not
long ago 1 was told by
a man who had had 30
years’ experience of the
Gulf country and its
natives that he had
often known abos. who
could tell accurately
the name of the owner
of a certain article,
such as a whip or a
hat, simply by sniffing
the scent which clung
to the article, and iden-
tifying it with a man
whom they knew, in-
cidentally, mod e r n
medical research has
established the fact
that the human body
gives off a definite
aura, which can not
only be seen plainly
by the use of the pro-
per methods, but can
even be used for the
diagnosis of disease.
It is more than prob-
able that the scent in
question is closely con-
nected with this aura,
if, indeed, the two are
not one and the same
thing. The ability of
the abo. to detect it is
not due to the posses-
sion by him of any
special sense or gift,
but simply to the
hypersensitiveness of
the sense of smell,
which is found in all
primitive peoples. The
ability is not owned
by all abos. in equal
degree, but is more
highly developed by a
few here and there,
they being possessed of
a still more acute sense
than the others.
“Tamornie” : Camels which have been run-
ning loose for some time with free access to water
require to be brought in and made accustomed to
being without water for days before starting on a
dry track. A camel straight off water is as useless
as a horse for such a journey. Cattle can be trained
in the same way: Farquharson Bros, did it with a
mob of about 900 bullocks in 1920. They drifted
the mob from Flora Valley (VK.A.) across the >".T.
into Carrandotta Downs ,(Q.), with a loss of only
nine head. Many dry stages were passed, one being
105 miles. These cattle had beforehand been denied
water for extending periods till they were able to go
without for four or five days. Stockmen on Gien-
ormiston station (Q.) state that cattle from the
back of that run come in to water only two or three
times a week.
“W.J.C.”: Tell “Cully” (B. 30/7/’25)
that when I said banana-pollen was abortive, I
referred to the pollen of the cultivated tribe; and
it has become so simply because man decided to
supplant the normal reproductive process by using
suckers to refill his orchard. The banana accordingly
slowed down, and ultimately arrived at the stage
where it merely grew fat and did nothing. “Cully’s”
wild banana of the Cairns (Q.) district is closely
related to the “Cavendish.”
“Jesmond”; “Cully’s” wild banana (B. 30/7/’25)
is undoubtedly one of the ancestors of the
cultivated variety, and furnishes ocular proof of the
effect of cultivation on plants. The original species
is believed to be the plantain, and “Cully’s” find
is the connecting-link between the two. The absence
of seed in the banana of commerce is not a charac-
teristic of the plant, but due to centuries of cultiva-
tion ; one may sometimes—though rarely—get fruit
containing a few seeds. The genus (Musa) has long
been known to man. The plantain’s name, Musa
paradisiaca, is a reminder that such was believed to
be the forbidden fruit, and the value of the banana
itself has been appreciated for at least 2000 years.
Its classification, Musa sapientum, refers to the men-
tion by Theophrastus (e. 300 n.c.) that such was
the food of Indian philosophers.
* * * *
“Te Wliare”: It is reckoned that the call
of the eompanero, or bell-bird, of South America,
can be heard at three miles, which rather takes the
shine out of the efforts of our crested bell-bird
and the bell-miner—one of the lioneyeater tribe,
and the “bell-bird” of Kendall’s fine poem. For
penetrative quality I go nap on the vocal efforts of
a young lyre-bird, handled when nearly ready to
leave the nest. While digging its sharp claws into
one’s flesh it usually emits a shrill call, which will
bring the mother bird hastening home although she
may be scratching for insects a full mile distant.
* * * *
“Km”: The Japanese pearl-shell divers
out of Broome (N.-W.A.) are very superstitious. At
the commencement of the season they take outside
with them a case of port wine, and as each bottle
is opened the sea has the first swig, for the diver
personally sees that the first mouthful or so is
emptied overboard. This is supposed to bring him
luck through the season. Should he send up a
turtle in the shell-bag, he will, on completion of
the day’s work, cut it up, and the whole of the
meat, with the exception of the head, is placed in
a tin and stewed. He takes the head on deck,
sprinkles some cooked rice into its mouth, kneels
before it, utters a short prayer, bows and throws
it overboard. This is supposed to bring him luck
in the next “take” of shell.

CONCERTINA JACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Old Jack was camped on the river’s bank
And his lines were cast on a mile of reach,
While noisy crowds from a town closed by
Were sporting free on the sandy beach;
And watching the children’s merry pranks.
As the rippling water splashed their knees,
He opened his concertina out
And softly his fingers pressed the keys.
“Barbara Allan” and “Sweet Marie”—
Quaint tunes that only the old ones knew,
Who’d danced and sung in the' shearers’ huts
In the days when the towns were far and few.
iheir pulses quickened and fingers drummed;
And soon they were up on their old stiff feet.
They danced to the rhythmic measure again
And it brought back memories lost and sweet.
He played while they danced till-the sun went down
And the west was arched with a golden glow;
And some of them shuffled and swayed and swung
Till night closed in and they had to go.
I hen ’possums and owls and night-hawks came
And some of the things that crawl and creep ;
But over the keys his fingers flew
With never a thought of rest or sleep.
A full moon swung in a star-decked sky ;
The bush was filled with the sounds of night
The splash of a fish at the river’s rim,
The screaming cry of a passing kite.
A rabble of dusky forms passed by.
A hundred men, then a hundred more;
I hey capered around in a wild man's dance
Of a kind that lie never had seen before.
And some of them beat on silent drums
Or flourished their boomerangs, shook their spears ;
Slim bodies striped with markings weird
And a gleaming bone in their pendant ears.
They moved with fantastical step and pause;
But no dust rose from the trampled ground.
Shell necklets dangled and hand smote hand
With not so much as a tinkling sound!
The dark forms passed and then horsemen came.
Their boots were high and their beards were long.
From each man’s shoulder a gun was slung
And each had whip with a twelve-foot thong.
They tied their horses and leaned their guns
By the rugged bole of a red-gum tree ;
They schottisched here and they polkaed there—
Oh, it did his old heart good to see!
The old man chuckled and hummed and played,
Though his throat was dry and his hands were
spent;
But never a sup nor a rest had he
Till the last of the silent horsemen went.
Then he slaked his thirst »at the water’s edge
And the concertina pealed an air;
He looked again where the men had.* danced
And they were on foot who had gathered there.
’Twas an old love song that he softly strummed ;
But they heeded him not by word or look,
For every man had a dog at heel
And handled a stick with a curling crook.
Then old Jack pondered. He changed his tune;
And he saw them start and he saw them spring,
For they were shepherds of Scottish birth
And the tune he played was the Highland fling.
When someone came at the break of day
His face was pressed to the cool wet sand;
His wasted body was stiff and bent,
But the concertina was in his hand.
They buried him deep by a shady tree ;
And no stone marks where he lies at rest
With his grizzled head on his tattered swag
Ana the keys he loved on his quiet breast.

"Rata”: Re the rapidity with which the
Australian abo. strain fades out (B. 18/6/’25), the
same thing is noticeable in Maoriland intermarriages.
The Maori strain is faint in the third generation,
and almost lost in the fourth, the members of which
are often blue-eyed and fair-haired. In some cases
there remains a suggestion of their ancestry in a
flatness of the nose and a fulness of the lips, but
only a person familiar with the original traits would
perceive it. As in Maoriland intermarriage with
the brown race is common in ail grades of society,
with no loss of social caste to the white partner,
there has been a wide field for observation. Some
pessimists suggest that there may be a reversion to
typo further down the generations, as in the case of
the gipsy strain, but nothing of that kind is on
record yet, and no one anticipates the full reversion
to color and characteristics that makes intermarriage
with the negro race so abhorrent to Americans.

“Pick”: Swans do not, as “H.L.N.” (B.
30/7/’25) supposes, assemble in some particular spot
because the feeding there is good. All along the
coast they have at intervals meeting lakes, and may
be seen hurrying thereto from their feeding-grounds
just after daybreak. On the shores of Handkerchief
Lake, South Coast (N.S.W.), when at dawn the in-
coming battalions of these birds from the southern
lagoons alongshore mass together, each platoon ap-
pearing on the wing in its V formation, the
clarionet welcoming from thousands of throats below
is a music worth hearing. The lake is an expansive
sheet, but I have often seen it completely covered
with swans.

23/7/’25) can be reduced markedly by adopting the
■‘no-breakfast” plan in very hot weather. I have
taus worked through the hottest mornings and been
genuinely surprised to hear complaints about the
heat. I have even prolonged the experiment by
abstaining from food till the cool of the evening-.
One speedily becomes accustomed to the regime and
feels no inclination to eat till the evening dinner-
hour is reached, when one enjoys a hearty meal.
This is the experience of a healthy, hard-working
individual, neither a diet crank nor a hypochondriac.
* * * *
“Coot”: The first reference to the wood
of the casuariha resembling oak (“Coolabah,” B.
2/7/'25) is to be found in Captain Cook’s Journal,
May 6, 1770: “Although wood is here (Botany Bay)
in very plenty, yet there is very little variety
Another sort grows tall and straight, something like
Pines—the wood of this is hard and Ponderous, and
something of the Nature of America live Oak.” The
prefix “she” was probably used to indicate an
inferiority of timber in respect of texture or color.
REMORSE.
“’Struth, I believe I forgot ter pay me water rates this year!”
as “she-beecli,” “she-pine.” No aboriginal word can
be found to support the assumption that “she-oak” is
a corruption of a native name. As far back as
1792 the “he” and “she” were known as such to
settlers.
* * * *
“Caroline”: “Nikko” (B. 25/6/’26) was
wrong in stating that M.L. sportsmen were unable
to secure a specimen of the chamois for the Dun
edin Exhibition. The managing director of the Mt.
Cook Motor Co. got specimens of the chamois and the
thar, put them into cbld storage for a few days, and
then forwarded them to the taxidermist. Both ani-
mals have thriven in M.L., so much so that the Gov-
ernment intends making an open season for them next
year.
* * * *
“W.J.C.”: “Curlew” (B. 2/7/’25) throws
suspicion on “Nitric’s” theory of grass seed sur-
viving bore-water temperatures up to 210 degrees.
It is a well-established fact that many seeds need
the aid of some ex-
ternal agency to break
their hard testa or seed
coat before germination
can take place. Prior
to planting silver-
wattle . its seeds must
be baked to crack this
covering, or boiled to
soften it, if a good
result is to be secured.
On the Atherton (Q.)
tableland, after virgin
(rub has been felled
nd burnt off, an im-
mense growth of Cape
gooseberries invariably
appears, due to the
fact that the fire has
shown , a way out to
the embryo anxious 10
germinate. Nature in
its normal course would
allow very few of the
seeds to fulfil their
function. Similarly,
before the storm
months, fires cross most
of the northern mount-
ain ridges, and the first
shower thereafter brings
up new grass plants.
It would seem, then, that grass, like many other
seeds, can withstand considerable temperatures.
“Buttenderry”: “Jim C.” (B. 16/7/’25)
is right when he says that scores of people believe
that the head of the catfish is poisonous, and I’m
one of them. I will even go further, and say that,
when caught in more or less stagnant water, the
tail is also poisonous, likewise the middle. I- am
aware that many people have eaten them without any
ill-effects, but personally I have vivid recollections of
the day when, the tuckerbox being empty, I yielded
to th<> persuasions of a neighbor who assured me that
they were perfectly wholesome and sweeter than cod.
I had one for tea that night, and for hours after
thought I had seen my last sunrise. It was worse
than ptomaine poisoning, and I have always regretted
that the man who recommended the delicacy didn’t
stay to tea.
“Nitric”: “Pick” is incorrect in stating
(B. 23/7/’25) that the sea anemone paralyses its
victims after the fashion of the electric eel. The
former belongs to the Colleuterata, a low group of
marine organisms which include jellyfish and the
blue-bottle or “Portu-
guese inan-o’-war.” All
of these sting their
prey or enemy, for
defence purposes only,
and by the same means,
namely, stinging cap-
sules. These capsules
have much the same
structure in all lower
marine forms, and con-
sist of a coiled trigger
hair which, when
touched, discharges sud-
denly. Batteries of
these peculiar cells are
grouped along the ten-
tacles of the sea anem-
ones, and when stimu-
lated act as weapons of
offence or defence. But
the electric eel and
electric fish, such as
the torpedo, give de-
finite electric shocks.
Strangely enough, these
shocks, which are vol-
untary, exhaust the
animal just as a stor-
age battery is ex-
hausted, and become
weaker and w T eaker on
repetition. Numerous
experiments have shown
that they are due to
ordinary electricity.
Thus, if the fish is
touched with an insu-
lating body, ho effect
is felt, but if the back
of the fish is touched
with the hand, and the
belly with a metal rod.
a violent shock is felt.
Faraday estimated that
the electric eel will
give a shock equal to that produced by 15 large
Leyden jars.
* * * *
“J.D.C.”: There are peculiarities about
the spread of anthrax which have never been satis-
factorily explained. It has been assumed that if
infected stock die in clean country, and the carcases
are allowed to decay, a source of infection will be
established at that spot. Experience has shown this
view to be correct in the main, but many exceptions
exist. On most infected holdings there are paddocks
regarded as clean. In the event of a sudden out-
break, advantage is taken of this by at once moving
the affected stock to one of these paddocks. Deaths
continue for some days after removal, and as condi-
tions often render burning impossible, the carcases
rot where they lie—and still the country remains
clean. Before preventive inoculation was proved
effective, it was a general custom to “travel” the
sheep as soon as anthrax appeared. If dying when
put on the roads, they probably continued to die for
about 10 days, during which time the mob had covered
60 or 70 miles. I know of one property regarded
as clean which was “infected” in this way almost
annually for years, and, although continually stocked,
no case of anthrax has been known to originate
there. One can scarcely assume that an ordinary
wire fence will suffice to separate “clean” and “in-
fected” country continuously, but such often appears
to be the case. The only reasonable conclusion is
that certain soils contain chemical or other constitu-
ents which destroy the anthrax spores. If so, it
must need a powerful agent to exterminate a spore
which has been proved repeatedly to be nearly fire-
proof. Failing this theory, it is difficult to explain
the fact that certain places are, apparently, per-
manently immune.
* * * *
“Billo C.” : The flock of black sheep seen
by “Yarrum” at Havilah (B. 30/7/’25) was not by
any means unique. I remember at least two lots
in N.S.W. and one in South Aus. Nor were the sheep
“a distinct breed.” They were bred by selection
of the small percentage of blacks found in all-white
merino flocks, and I fancy dated from the time when,
for reasons of their own, manufacturers were demand-
ing black wool and priced it above the white fleece.
When the value of black fell to normal again,
breeders abandoned the enterprise, and colored sheep
then found their way to the slaughter-houses. Black
is doubtless the primitive color of sheep, and the con-
stant tendency to reproduce it in spite of the selec-
tion of whites is an illustration of the well-known
evolutionary law. If left to itself every merino
flock would probably retrograde to black by slow 7
degrees. As for their being “difficult to shear on
account of the black skin,” w 7 e used to get over that
at Jumbuck Vale by dipping them in a whitewash
bath before passing them on to the men with the
tongs.
* * * *
‘‘Curlew”: My observations do not agree
with “Pick’s” (B. 16/7/’25) on plain turkeys taking
a 50-vard run before flying, although they will oftfln
walk a long way, when they do not wish to fly.
When rising at their leisure, they take three or foqr
steps for a jump-off, but if pressed for time car,
bound into the air and get going off the mark.
With a .22 rifle and the ability to hit one up to
300yds., there is« no difficulty in keeping a large
camp supplied where turkeys are plentiful. With
a shotgun they can sometimes, but not always, be
successfully bamboozled by. galloping round them
in a wide circle and decreasing the circle until
within shot. Under this treatment they often squat
and trust to camouflage; then you should jump off
the horse and run at them, getting a good shot as
they rise. This, however, does not always work. 1
have caught a few, and known of many caught, by
coming on them near a wire-fence and galloping
straight at them. They often try to get through the
fence, and may be caught, but sometimes make a
side spring and escape by flight.
* * ■» *
“Pick” : For the information of ‘‘Diggeroo,”
who complains (B. 30/7/’2o) that sheepkillers have
him bested, let me describe two methods by which
dingoes were eventually poisoned after long periods
of immunity. The squatters of Southern Monaro
(N.S.W.) once subscribed a reward of £6O for the
destruction of a dog that for years had oeen attack-
ing their flocks. He had defied all the customary
plans for poisoning or trapping, and many a good
stock-horse had been run to a standstill chasing him.
Satisfied at last that the warrigal would not touch
anything bearing the scent of human hands, Harry
Edwards, of Bibbenluke station, handled a hunk of
mutton by means of a wire hook. He dropped
strychnine into it and dipped it into boiling fat.
This supper he buried by the wild-dog’s track, and
next morning lifted the £6O scalp. Beggan Beggan
station (N.S.W.) once offered a reward of £25 for
a notorious dingo slut. Many hunters spent weeks
in trying to earn the money. Eventually a swaggy
arrived at Beggan, who brought in the dead slut
and a litter of live pups. lie had traced the mother
to her lair, and in her absence had smeared the
family with poisoned fat.
“Coolabah”: A plan which I have seen used success-
fully for poisoning foxes will probably prove oi
benefit to “Diggeroo” (B. 30/7/’25). Some dripping
is placed in a lib. baking-powder tin. Strychnine is
then sprinkled on the surface of the dripping and
smoothed in. Three-parts of the tin are left empty,
and when the dog finds the bait he is just able to
reach the fat. He cannot clean out the tin and so
get an overdose, or gobble the contents and die
in his lair, but will keep licking at the dripping until
the right amount of poison for toppling him over is
reached. A man I knew once poisoned four foxes
in a night by burying the poisoned bodies of
birds at intervals along a trail made by dragging
a roast rabbit.
“Sunset”: “Diggeroo,” who asks the best way to
poison dingoes, should try this. Melt some fat,
with strychnine, on to a piece of bark. When the
dingo finds the bark, he will endeavor to lick the
fat off, and before he has satisfied himself that he
has exhausted the supply, the poison will have begun
to take effect. More than one dingo may be caught
with the same bait.
* * * *
“Rex”: Has the American bison or his
NT. cousin ever been imported into Vic. ? At
Beech Forest and in the surrounding district there
is a bovine strain which undoubtedly suggests a
buffalo ancestry. With full forequarters, a shaggy
torso and an inclination to leanness, these beasts
seldom fatten for market, and consequently are diffi-
cult to sell, even to local bullock-drivers. An
American visitor states that the bison does not cross
with domesticated cattle, but he admitted the strik-
ing likeness of these local beasts to the U.S. animal.
* * * •
“J.A.”: Respecting crabs (B. 23/7/’25)•
there are two particular spots favored by a rare
species, known locally as spider crabs. One spot
is within a few miles of Kingscote, Kangaroo Island,
and the other south of Port Lincoln. These crabs,
like mutton-birds,’ return to the same spot once a
year, and on the same day. If it be a w clear one
they may be seen arriving in shoals and piling
themselves up in the form of a mound. Their object
would appear to be to cast their shells, as for soma
days after arrival cast-off shells float ashore in
thousands. At both places the resting-ground is on
a weedy bottom, and after the colony has aecom-
ACCORDING TO THE PROPHETS.
BOOLPER: “Hullo, MeAaron! Wife was just
telling me about that fire of your las'
Toosdee. I hope ”
McA ARON : “S-s-ssh! Shud ub, for gootness
sake! Id aind’t till next Toosdee!”
plished its business and gone abroad, a clear patch
shows the exact size of the mound. Local fishermen
have ho use for the spider crabs, as they consider
them to belong to the daddy-longlegs variety, which
is not marketable.
* * * *
“Mulga”: “Orange” (B. 9/7/’25) is mis-
taken in asserting that he has seen catfish caught
in the Macquarie (N.S.W.). Codfish and catfish
are not caught in the same waters. If ‘‘Orange”
wants catfish lie had better go to the Fitzroy or some
other river over the range. Jewfish, which also have
whiskers, must be what “Orange” saw landed. They
are certainly good eating.

OVERLAND
with SIX cylinders
As was expected—a marvel of
power and beauty... as for size—
the Most Surprising Car Value in
the Six-Cylinder Field.
WITH the enormous resources of the Willys Overland
Company directed towards the building of a Six=
Cylinder Car which would be light but powerful,
reasonably priced yet Big in Size as in Quality, the public
had the right to expect something unusual. . . .
Here it is!
A Six=Cylinder Car of 112=3/4 inches wheelbase with a
40=horsepower motor to sell in the vicinity of £360.
Judge its wonderful value by the fact that it is longer in
wheelbase than several well-known cars selling for as
much as £lOO more.
With all the facts before you, you would unhesitatingly say
that the price of the Overland Six should be well over £4OO,
but it is surprisingly below that figure.
With the size of a Big Six=Cylinder Car it carries the price
of a Light Six.
The body is beautifully long and exceptionally
low in its lines—finished in two colorings—grey
upper, blue on the sides—in keeping with the
modern practice of high=priced American Cars.
Balloon Tyres are standard. Upholstery is in
Blue Leather, rich and deep.
BUIL I to meet the require-
ments of that large body
of motor-car owners who
have longed for the smooth
operation of a six-cylinder
motor at a cost not beyond
their means, the Fine New
Overland Six is in every
measure a motor-car for a very
definite field, built by John N.
Willys to fulfil a desire to offer
the world’s motoring public a
fine, graceful, powerful, de-
pendable car at a price within
the reach of everybody’s purse.
Construction of this new
Overland Six has been carefully
worked out to give the highest
degree of service. The ability
of the car to perform splen-
didly under every possible con-
dition has been thoroughly
proved by exhaustive tests. The
new Overland Six will stand up
under the most rigorous de-
mands of endurance and power.
Complete line of open and
closed models. Prices on
application.

WAX
Johnson’s Polishing Wax is the ideal finish for all your
floors. It will make them beautiful—easy to care for
they won’t be slippery—and will not heel-print. And
Johnson’s WAX is, by far, the most economical finish
for floors and linoleum. With waxed floors expensive
refinishing is never necessary, for walked-on places
can be easily and quickly rewaxed as worn spots
appear, without going over the entire floor.
The easy way to wax floors and linoleum is with a
Johnson Weighted Polishing Brush. It spreads the Wax
evenly— polishes the floor easily—and is an ideal

“Within the Law,” revived after eight
years of consignment to the archives, got a
great reception from a crowded house at the
King’s on Saturday night, Muriel Starr
appearing in her old part of Mary Turner,
the salesgirl, who got three years’ gaol for
the thing she didn’t do. There was a spring
Hower-show" upon the stage at the final
curtain, and Muriel, Floie Allan and Frank
Harvey had to give the password before the
gurgling first-nighters of the gallery would
go out into the freezing night. The leading
lady handed some laurels to Floie Allan, w r ho
absolutely ran away writh the part of the
confidence lass, Agnes Lynch. Muriel airs
charming coat-frocking of russet-brown kasha
with vest and collar of beige tones, topped
by a Bangkok straw headpiece of nigger
hue; later she covers sand-colored georgette
with a cloak of black satin much embroidered
and fur-adorned. The fascinating Aggie
vamped the police-inspector in an ensemble
suit of reseda-green satin and cloth, with
squirrel fur and harmonising millinery. Of
the revivalists were Mayor Brunton and his
lady, John Monash and Miss Rentwitch.
T. H. Cochran was host at an evening
gathering at Menzies’ of Melbourne’s naieest
in matron, maid and man. Edna Thomas,
who is teaching us the beauty of nigger
spirituals and Creole love songs, was the
very pardonable excuse for the jollo. Some-
one got things mixed in the decorations, for
there w"as an arch all pink peach blossom and
heath, but Tommy and his guest avoided its
very nuptial shelter. The lady of the warm
notes and nature contrasted a white feather
fan and ivory comb against black velvet
slightly embroidered with brilliants. Mrs.
Lawrence, mother of Lucile, wdio plinks her
harp-strings so gracefully, had crystal fringe
bordering frocking of peacock-blue velvet.
The pretty harpist had a glistening white
robe beneath an embroidered crimson shawl;
accompanist Constance Piper was flounced
and corsaged in filmy ivory lace. Among
the richly apparelled was Mrs. S. M. Bruce,
with gold embroidery upon amber draperies;
Mrs. Harold Clapp, wdio covered black geor-
gette with a cloak of black velvet; Mrs.
Robert Knox, a symphony in old gold; Mrs.
I’urves Smith, with water-lilies blossoming
upon the shoulder-strap of an ethereal blue
gown; and Mrs. Goddard, in gold tissue
flower-patterned. Wilma Clarke was the
most striking of the younger set, wearing
black sheathing with trails of flowers in vari-
hued beads and much gold and silver thread.
Mrs. Barry Thomson, Mrs. Gilbert Lodge,
the Harold and Russell Grimwades, Major
and Mrs. Little, the Spencer dame, the Harry
Gullett pair and Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy Dyer
were among the guests.
The Royal Automobile Club of Victoria
put on top gear for its annual hopping at
St. Kilda Town Hall. The petrol consumers
talked car at supper-tables arranged upon
the cabaret system round the room, beneath
garlands of pink roses and colored lights set
amid the blue and gold of the R.A.C. Jazz
caps and other novelties kept the party on
the up-grade. Mrs. E. W. Cox, wife of the
president, wore gowning of browm georgette
sparked up with floral effects in dull blue
and rose. Crystal beading covered Mrs.
H. J. Robertson’s frocking of purple; Mrs.
Richard Fitcher wore raiment of cyclamen
pink hue with artistic embroidery, and Mrs.
Patkin’s fair shingle topped dressing of
apple-green, silver tissue and diamente. St.
Kilda’s Mayor, J. B. Levi, was of the
gathering with Mrs. Levi, whose W"rappihg
was moonlight-blue georgette, bead-adorned.
St. Kilda’s citizens one-stepped in strerigth
at the local Town Hall in honor of the
Mayoral Levis, whose jazz early in the season
was of the finest. Dancers tripped beneath
festoons of gold leaves and jade and pink
blossoms with corresponding hued lights. The
Mayoress w T as clothed in petunia georgette
steel-embroidered, and daughter Ilma’s gold
lame had a bordering of petals in fuchsia
shades. The notable hop was secretaried by
Frederick Chamberlain, St. Kilda’s Town
Clerk. The U.S. Consular Morans were
there, the lady in black velvet. Mrs. Fred
Chamberlain, in wrapping of chenille-em-
bossed black velvet, brought along daughters
Marie, in jade green brocade, and Alice, a
<tudy in blue and silver.
Matrons and maidens of last summer were
left with a legacy of freckles and sunburn as
a result of wearing short gloves and shorter
sleeves. So this spring sleeves may still
be abbreviated, but gloves will climb to meet
them 12 or 16 button-lengths. The silk
variety has returned in fetching stybs,
ruffled and frilled, and in hues to match all
raiment. The fair sex found that for comfort
and coolness silk gloves left kid at the post,
and therefore the coming season the sun will
discover but little bare arm to leave painful
and disfiguring kisses on. The young man
of romantic tendencies this spring will say
it in silk gloves instead of cold cream.
A meeting de luxe the annual
gathering of the Toorak-Soutb Yarra branch
of the Alfred Hospital Auxiliary, held at
the home of the Robert Knox pair at Toorak.

room bright with peach blossom and irises,
and steam-heated, beckoned the faithful. The
bird-like notes of Constance Burt, the deeper
ones of Victoria Anderson and tea washed
down the facts and figures of president
11. M. Collins. The hospital’s little shop
boutique brought in a clear £7OO above build-
ing extension expenses, and the institution
now accommodates 295 in-patients as against
163 in June, 1924.
Citizens of Essendon gave their Mayor
and Mayoress, the George Mitchells, a splen-
did ball at the Town Hall, Moonee Ponds, on
Friday, and dropped in a few substantial
mementoes of their civic reign in a wristlet
watch, a canteen of cutlery and some silver
afternoon-tea necessaries and salver for the
latter, with a gold cigarette-case for his
Worship. The success of the undertaking
rested with A. B. Hiskens, popular sec.
of the Moonee Valley Racing Club;
J. B. Hunt and Town Clerk Cameron.
The decorations followed a scheme of mauve
and pink, and the stage was an entire mossy
bank whereon primulas bloomed. The
Mayoress blended nicely with the setting, in
pink velvet touched up with silver and blue
brocade, and dark fur. Filmy lace veiled
the gold frocking of Mrs. A. V. Hiskens, and
all in gold attire was Mrs. Cameron.
The Assembly Hall bulged for the fourth
of the Calvocoressi lectures on French music
written for Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, president of
the Alliance Frangaise. The period covered
was from Cesar Franck to Debussy. Bea-
trice Ternan in nicely modulated tones, and
wearing pale blue draperies linked up with
pink roses and foliage, read the lecture, and
illustrators included vocalists Muriel Cheek,
gowned in black georgette, Violet Jackson, in
apple-green charmante, and William Cadzow;
pianists being Rieke Parker, frocked in
emerald-green velvet, Ada Freeman and Elsie
Fraser. Particularly attractive were two
songs, written for flute accompaniment only,
by Albert Roussel; Muriel Cheek and C. R.
Chugg were the demonstrators.
The French Government has sent along
more decorations for worthy citizens. Of the
honored is M. Maurice Carton, a one-time
much-liked professor of the Uni., who gets
the coveted Cross of a Chevalier of the Legion
of Honor. The ceremony of investiture was
deputed to John Monash, Grand Officer of.
the Legion, at a party given by the Socirite
Litteraire Frangaise at the Lyceum Club. An-
other citizen who has been recognised is
Olive Davies, the popular and efficient sec.
to the French Consulate. For her work in
this capacity for the past seven or eight
years, she has now" the privilege of writing
“Oflicier d’Academie” after her name, and
wearing the decoration “Les Palmes Acade-
miques” on her dress front. This order ranks
second among the three chief French national
orders.
Not many artists of late have put up a
show" of such uniform merit as that of
Charles Wheel-
er, whose pic-
tur e s adorn
the walls of
the New Gal-
lery until the
29th. The
public has not
been slow to
see their
char m, and
Charles won’t
have to pay
much r e-
turn cartage
to his studio
in Tower
House. The
trustees of the
National Art
Gallery have
signed a
cheque of 90
guineas for
two fascinat-
ing nude maidens ready for a dip in sylvan
retreats. Such nice shapely lasses they are
that an Ariadne-like statue in the foreground
of one is bowed down in envy. Humphrey’s
camera caught the whimsical expression of
the artist.
The Royal Victorian Institute for the
Blind, which ranks as the first in Australia
arid could hold its head up in any world
assembly, has spent in the past five years
over £95,000 upon new buildings, extensions
and improvements. Roughly £BO,OOO oJ: this
yet remains to be receipted, so vice-president
James Angus suggested at the annual wangi
the other day that the big crowd of patrons
present might arrange to collect or give
£5 per year per head to reduce the debt and
also help by purchasing articles made by
the wonderful seeing fingers of the insti-
tute’s inhabitants. A fascinating pro-
gramme of costume dances and club-swing-
ing by blind students and music by the
famous blind orchestra sweetened the appeal.
The patrons of the cafe chantant at Buck-
ley and Nunn’s not only helped St. Vincent’s
Hospital building fund, but got full value
for their half-guineas as well. The firm
handed over the Elizabethan tea-room, with
its splashes of blue and gold against black
panelling, footed the bills for extras and
provided the tea-party for over ‘4OO. The food
was such as to make the catering at some
of our recent balls look as a Sunday-school
treat. J.C.W. artists, Eileen Castles, Cecil
Parkes and Herbert Walton joined the
melody-makers. Marie La Varre, her fair
marcelled shingle waving above black frock-
ing, was in the flight of popular songbirds.
Those brilliant co-workers, the Tallis dame
and Mrs. W. M. Robins, were the “con-
veners” of the afternoon, which means some-
thing over £3OO to the splendid cause. Will-
ing hands were lent by Mrs. Murray Morton,
Mrs. Westhoven, Mrs. McCallum Neil, Mrs.
Coolahan and many of the younger set.
Her chum Pegg Clarke here pictures
for us Dora Wilson, whose pastel portraits
are known far
aud wide. At
present she is
preparing
many charm-
ing studies for
her show, to
be held in
Adelaide about
the middle of
next month;
after that she
will gather up
her chalks and
set out to con-
quer the har-
bor city’s con-
ii oisseurs.
Among her re-
cent successes
is a portrait
of the late
C h ristopher
Rous, the
small son of
Lord and Lady Stradbroke.
Melbourne’s Repertory Theatre Society is
getting recognised, and the just-concluded
season of Pshaw’s “Captain Brassbound’s
Conversion” had excellent attendances. Re-
quests have come for the society to broadcast
some of its work; so performers have agreed
to go on the air with a couple of short plays
and also an act or two of “A Bill of Divorce-
ment.” These should be splendid advertise-
ment for the enthusiasts. That clever little
amateur actress and playwright, Isabel
Handley, has just completed the cast for her
play, “The Mandarin Coat,” which is the
next Repertory offering at the Playhouse—
October 14-17.
McEwan’s new building in Little Collins-
street. close to Elizabeth-street, houses upon
its second floor a tearoom in most attractive
setting, god-parented by the Australian
Board of Missions. Primrose-toned walls
form effective background for dark shelves
with brass and Oriental ornaments and black
furniture. A “bazaar” spread with rugs from
the Indian missions and wonderful things
from China and Japan occupy an alcove. A
flower-stall adds also to the funds. The help,
save for a manageress and kitchen staff, is
voluntary, and comes mostly from Old Girls
of the C. of E. Grammar Schools. On the
same floor are the offices of the Australian
Board of Mission with a wee chapel at-
tached, the altar of which has a canopy in
batik work. Suburban and country parishes
supplied the tables and chairs, and John
Longstaff designed the menu card.
Premier and Mrs. Lyons were notable
absentees from the festivities with which
Hobart welcomed the section of Uncle Sam’s
Fleet detailed for the visit to the Derwent.
There was a death in the family of seven,
the youngest, Garnet Philip, going under to
pneumonia and meningitis after a week-long
battle. As the Fleet was swinging into line
and lieadMig out to sea the last tribute was
being added to a billowing hillock of blossoms
at Cornelian Bay cemetery. It was a magni-
ficent cross of violets from Admiral
Magruder.
Carlyon’s, at St. Kilda, which lately
passed into new hands for a neat little
£35,000 or thereabouts, is to house a cafe
chantant and bridge-party on September 15 to
help the Sisters of Charity reduce the debt
on that fine building, the Catholic Ladies’
College. Mrs. Barry Thomson heads an
enthusiastic committee.
Enid McQuie, who was one of the atten-
dant maids at the marriage in June of Jean
Apperly and barrister Fred Gamble, became
a sister-in-law by marrying John Apperly the
other night at-All Saints', East St. Kilda,
Uncle Rev. Walter Boake, assisted by Rev.
John Jones, doing the riveting. The bride
and her two 'maids wore trucking of ivory
velvet, the latter striking an effective note
by carrying bunches of holly.
Members of the art circle of the Lyceum
Club gathered for their first annual dining
last week at the club. Margaret Baskor-
vilie's statuette, “Vanity”—a maiden gazing
at her mirrored reflection —was the table’s
central adornment. The chatter was colored
by an interesting discourse on the Never
Never by authoress Mrs. .Eneas Gunn.
Members of the Lyceum Club dine their
parting president, Dr. Georgina Sweet, on
September 18. The medico, who has not
to rely upon patients to supply the sinews
of war or travel, goes for a long tour of
the Yeast.
The annual meeting of the British Music
Society is announced for to-morrow night
at Mr. and Mrs. .1. Dyer's Toorak home.
If just a few of Melbourne’s moneyed folk
took the same interest in musical matters
as Mrs. Jimmy, this city might be less
disposed to swallow almost any unmelodic
bluff presented to it. The lady, who is hon.
secretary of the Victorian centre of the
8.M.5., has dreams, which are materialising,
of permanently endowing this local move-
ment of keeping the British-born composer
before his or her own race. “On Wenlock
Edge,” by Vaughan Williams, will be the
special offering to-morrow evening after the
formal business.
Lee White very nearly took her bright
smile to cheer the cherubim and seraphim
last week. After the season closed at the
Athenaeum, Clay Smith’s popular wife was
obliged to enter Mont St. Evins for an
operation which caused her friends much
anxiety. Latest reports announce steady
progress and promise that the lady will soon
be able to take up her job of making just
mortals to smile again.
The illness of a daughter who is of the
community of the Sacre Cceur brought
Mick Meagher from Bathurst last week.
The patient is now happily recovering.
The Meagher family is looking for-
ward to the arrival by the Mooltan
from the Great Smoke of another daughter,
Sheila, who married in ’Frisco a year or so
ago C. E. Barnes. His dad is Bananalander
Jack Barnes, who sold a station property to
the Queensland Government for six figures
recently, and still has many miles of country,
numerous flocks and herds and top-notch
gee-gees left.
Death took away the other day a one-
time prominent citizen in Mrs. Joseph
Saddler. Her great energy and benevolence
helped to found the Bush Nurses and pro-
vide for the Talbot Colony of epileptics.
The Austral Salon was one of her happy
ideas, and she was much to the fore in the
Women’s Exhibition held in Melbourne 18
years or so back. Some years ago, with her
husband, a popular Customs House official,
she retired from her public activities, resid-
ing at Dromana; but both came to town for
the Fleet festivities and were of the guests
at the G.-G.’s ball at Federal Government
House. Her death resulted from a motor-
car accident, in which her husband also was
injured.
Over from the Harbor City for a holiday
are solicitor J. J. Carroll and Mrs. Carroll.
A visit to Canberra was in their itinerary,
but many old friends have discovered them at
Meuzies’, and the trip to 1 >ryberra is likely
to wait until the Duke of York arrives
there.
Every year Mr. and Mrs. Bland Holt and
Miss Coppin entertain such inmates of the
Old Colonists’ Homes, North Fitzroy (Vic.),
as are able to make the trip, at a picnic at
Sorrento. As many as 50 old folk, many of
them well over 80, have annually enjoyed
the hospitality of these kindly stage identities.
A brief note from Adelaide:-
This village is dark with pedagogues at present
with the annual conference of the Public Teacher*
Union falling due. Newspaper-magnate Langdon
Bonython was host at a cheerful tea-drinking to
numbers of them at the Brookman Hall. Daughter
Mrs. Angus Parsons, in black frocking and a black
hat, and Mrs. F. J. Gartrell, in indigo blue, helped
to hold Langdon's hands up.
Fifteen girls conspired to make the Piccadilly
like a blue-gum forest blossoming with Iceland poppies
for one-stepping purposes one day last week. Yvonne
Tolley, Alma Hill, Mollie Lawes and Gladys Ware
received the crowd, which included Gwen Bruce, in
charming wrappings of rose georgette; Marjorie Ware,
in cerise gold-embroidered ; and Mrs. Dudley Cox, who
aired cyclamen pink with georgette side panels.
Dead at 84, E. E. Butterfield, father of Tom
Butterfield, Minister for Lands. Born in England,
the old man came out in search of gold, and,
settling in Victoria, reared a family of six sons.
They all went on the land, mostly in S.A.

LETTER

GLOVES
Hundreds of lied Crossers dropped the
tear of farewell into the dish of tea brewed
at liose Hall to the glory of Lady ’Forster.
The pleasant common room of the Soldiers
Home avus the rallying-place, and through
its wide-flung windows the spring sunshine
Hooded, catching the slim crystal vases on
the tables and endowing them AA'ith a thou-
sand facets and prisms, above which mauve
and pink and white SAveet-pea hovered like
fragile moths. Daffodils and tawny Iceland
poppies frilled goldenly on every side, and the
retiring but pervasive wallflower swooned in
the Avarm censer of the August day. Wall-
lioAvers and forget-me-nots formed the posy over
which the G.-G.’s lady breathed her cream-
and-honey Avords to the lied Crossers.. “In
no country had so much been done, ’ sin l
said, “for the men who had fought.” And
though this is true, one thought of the limb-
less and T.B. men, , and realised lioav
little that much can be. Mrs. MacKinnon
and her Junior lied Crossers had a special
honorable mention in her Ex.’s communique.
Judge Ilolin and knight William Vicars told
over the rosary of Lady Forster’s kind deeds
with unction, and Gladys Owen’s resonant
voice filled the welkin with apologies for the
State’s A T ice-reine’s absence.
The Newingtoniaus can claim the outsize
dance of the week-end. Their Avhirl filled
the Wentworth Avitli girl in every variety of
the newest frocks. Gold, silver, copper and
brass, Avith the ores that glow: between, had
their tones reproduced in the metallic laces
and brocades that Avere features of the dress-
ing. Every big public-school had its envoy
at the flutter ; and the organising secretaries,
W. Cadogan and W. Wilson, can claim one of
the successes of a week of college, dances.
Dorothea Spinney told the Feminists to
their teeth the other day that the Greek
dramatists had expounded the doctrine of the
equality of women before Miss Preston .Stan-
ley or any other Feminist present had been
born. She broke the news so gently from
between the coat-collar of a gold garment
that looked like Athens n.c., and the brim
of a black panne hat that suggested Paris
after to-morroAV that even Ituby Rich was
comforted. Dorothea Avent on to prove her
statements Avitli extracts from playwrights
Avho perhaps emptied their goblets to the
destruction of prohibition CA T en in those days;
and then she and the Feminists dashed down
a libation of pekoe while a group of charm-
ing Australian voices raised themselves in
foreign and home-grown songs.
The Women’s Country Club rallied round
Dorothy Ilelmrich the other afternoon and
turned Its rooms into a gum-tipped boAver
for the visiting singer. Dorothy, in sand-
colored marocains, brought her own particu-
lar charm of simplicity to the crowded,
gathering, and blushed into her presentation
posy at the eulogies breathed over her by
Mrs. Earle Page. Cecile Adkins and Doro-
thy’s brother Dudley varied tea and talk
AA’ith an interesting programme of music.
Daughter Evelyn’s engagement caused a
ripple of excitement in the Spencer Brunton
circle at Gladswood, for Evelyn didn’t tell
the family till the beautiful diamond cluster
was fitted into position. The nicest man in
the world is Eric Lawson, once of Mudgee,
hut noAV of Strathfield. Nobody had suspected
the tAvo of harboring more than a friendly
interest in one another.
The conversazione of the Royal Art
Society Avas a misnomer. From the tick of
S till supper-bell an uninterrupted stream of
music floAved over the heads of the assem-
bly, conversation being submerged there-
under. If you were a lady, you sat rigid on
your little folding-chair and registered
applause. If you were a Philistine, you
gazed hard at something in the next room,
beyond the archway, pretended somebody had
beckoned to you, arose and stole quietly
beyond the rim of the music. Here Avere
many men gathered together in solemn con-
clave over the cargo of 50 dozen of Moun-
tain Dew, donated to the gathering by Harry
Lauder. Syd Long was for handing each
man a bottle to keep as a souvenir, and this
course would have been followed but for a
regrettable shortage of brown paper. Charlie
Bryant, whose lapel supported a gold palette
with impressive heraldry, distributed smiles
and waves of his tiny, Avell-shaped hand,
AA-itli an abandon that was only equalled by
the recklessness of John Baneks, who juggled
the coffee-cups for an outsize harem.
Friendly Jack Toohey came, and began the
night by buying Mary Edwards’s little
Chinese girl. Winslow Knight looked after
the music, and told stories too good to be
true between operatic outbursts. May
Moore, impressive in black velvets, piloted
Dean Talbot’s wife around the canvases, The
vivid Dattilo Rubbo, the Jackson couple
and the Bowrings, from Maoriland, were
others who splashed the night with color;
and a group of surely the youngest art
students in the world watched George Tay-
lor’s lightning sketches with rapt attention.
Jack Toohey had to cable his blessing to
son Irving the other day. has
announced his engagement to one of the
Pargiter girls of the well-known SjT African
shipping company. It was Captain Pargiter,
a brother of his fiancee, whom Irving’s pretty
sister, Girlie Toohey, married last year, and
from whom death parted her after a few
months.
The Bush Book Club is anchored for an-
other year to its breezy moorings on the
roofs of Castlercagh-street by the weight of
the books that simply poured in last Friday,
from early morning till late afternoon. Both
Lady Forster and Lady de Chair came to the
gathering, which is the last that the G.-G. s
lady can attend, and were treated to tea at
a table laden with peach-blossom. Violets,
boronia and a boomerang, made by a dinkurn
abo., were the loot scored by Lady Forster,
who looked softly pretty under the combined
influence of sables and a small hat, feather
drenched. Black opals and Persian blue
velvets purred all over the State vice-reine,
and the f rocking of visitors through the day
could not have been despised or rejected of
men.
The Royal Philharmonics burst into Colo-
ridge-Taylor’s “Hiawatha” for their 2ooth
concert, and the crowded Town Hall grew
wildly enthusiastic over this masterpiece,
which had been previously presented in in-
stalments under the batons of such veterans
as Hazon and Joseph Bradley. Taylor has a
number of compositions to his credit, but this
is the only one that has lived; no doubt the
barbaric touch in the libretto appealed to
the barbaric touch in him. Very cleverly
he varied the rather monotonous metre of
the poem: “Sweet trochaic milk and water,”
as a contemporary critic once wrote of _ it.
The singing of the chorus and the playing
of the orchestra were, however, too loud in
the Town Hall performance; they never got
below forte, and the general effect was rather
tiring. Jordan, though suffering from a cold
that occasionally tarnished a high note, sang
excellently ; as did baritone Jansen. Soprano
Ethel Osborn bore up well, though quite un-
suited to the part, which was written foe a
dramatic soprano.
Over on a short visit from Melbourne is
vivid Mrs. Apperly, high priestess of the
Repertory Society and wife of the good-
looking Dr. Apperly who lectures on patho-
logy at Melbourne Uni. Mrs. Apperly has
a claim to fame on her own account. She
was one of the Irish Players at the Abbey
Theatre, Dublin, and played the irresistible
Peg o’ My Heart over 500 times in various
parts of England, Scotland and Ireland.
This is a May Moore picture of Gwladys
Edwards, the .Westralian singer whose
soprano li a s
the real chant
of spring in
i t. Gwladys
is one of the
fe w Aiistra-
lians whose
foreign studies
were carried
out under, the
supervision of
the famed
M arches i.
Melba, wh o
heard Gwladys
w hen the
Perth son g-
bird was just
a youngster,
interested her-
self enor-
mously in her
career. Fo r
y ear s Miss
Edwards has
been leading soprano at Perth’s li.C. Cath-
edral. She succeeded Minnie Waugh, and
only relinquished her perch among the organ-
pipes for her flight to Sydney.
Mrs. Foster Mattei, the clever political
organiser from Westralia, who during her
stay in Sydney lias been secretary of the
Women’s Country Club, goes to Brisbane
this week, followed by a chorus of regret.
Her husband is a doctor in Queensland’s
Repatriation Department. Daughter Mau-
reen, who is contemplating matrimony in
Goulburn, remains behind. The Country
- Club staged an outsize farewell on Tues-
day to its popular secretary,
Randwick, the suburb in which even the
clergy is expected to have a working know-
ledge of Miller’s Guide (a popular padre,
about to receive a present from his parishion-
ers, is asked whether lie would prefer race-
glasses or a stop-watch), was interested in
the wedding of Thea Mayes, daughter of
Mrs. N. J. McDonald, to Jack, second son
of the William Kelsos, of Orville Lodge.
Jack Kelso is carrying on the traditions of
a family which has been associated with
the Australian turf from its very earliest
days. Thea made her vows at St. Jude s
in white georgette over satin. Jean Kelso
’maided in apricot-beaded georgette.
Isabel Ramsay —now the wife of Dr. R.
I-'oa, and living in Fans—is again plunged
into mourning by the death of her mother.
Mrs. Ramsay was the widow of the popular
John Ramsay, of the N.SAV. Hansard' staff,
who was killed in a motor accident about
two years ago while on his way home from
an all-night sitting of Parliament. Mrs.
Ramsay had troops of friends in the artistic
and musical worlds, and a great wave of
.sympathy goes to Isabel in her bereavement.
Would you think the original of this pic-
ture —W. 11. Gibson —had been on this bit
of the earth
45 years? For
20 of them he
has been one
of Sydney’s
cleverest ama-
te u r actors.
He has played
over 50 differ-
en t musical
comedy parts,
mostly wi t h
the Petersham
S ocie t y, in
addition to
produ c i n g
many of their
shows. A 11
the amateur
societies know
him, and lie
has ei tiier
played for each
of them or
given them the
assistance of liis varied experiences when they
struck a choppy sea. The daily job of this
Peter Pan is one that requires diplomacy
and a sunny disposition. He is a special
inquirer in the P.M.G.’s Department.
At last the women doctors of Sydney have
a hospital they can call their own. From the
little clinic at Surry Hills, which was their
starting-point, it has been a long and hard
pull to the Rachel Forster hospital at Red-
fern, which the G.G.’s lady opened on Satur-
day afternoon. The new hall of healing is
a semi-detached house in a terrace of three
built on the generous plan of other days. Its
walls are thick, its ceilings high, and light
and air simply flood into its rooms and pas-
sages. Standing on the sunny verandah Lady
Forster spoke her piece—laudation and val- ■
ediction in one. Perhaps the happiest note
she struck was in asking the committee of
women doctors to be sure to forward her a
photograph of the Rachel Forster grown into
a newer and bigger hospital. At present the
Institute holds only three cots; the women
doctors have gone on the slow but sure
method of paying spot-cash for everything,
so the Rachel Forster is opened free of debt.
Dr. Dick voiced a message of help from the
new Minister of Health, and Div Lucy Gul-
lett’s smile worked overtime when she saw
the gifts of linen clutched in every woman’s
hand.
The young boarders at Loreto , Convent.
Kirribilli, have lost a great chum by the
passing of Charles Hepburn. The kindly
gentleman, who was one of the leading local
R.C.’s. used to give the youngsters the time
of their lives on such occasions, as boatraces,
or Riverview’s annual at-home. If Mr. Hep-
burn said he would shepherd the crocodile,
Reverend Mother found no objection to any
cheerio. And a ton or so of chocolate
must have been consumed on these out-
ings, not to speak of pyramids of cream-puffs
and gallons of ice-cream. By profession Mr.
Hepburn was a patents attorney, and from
choice one of the cleverest and most ingenious
of topical verse-writers.
Winslow Knight tells this story of the
South Coast. When he was touring with
that bright little company of grand-opera
lovers that included Jean and Lute Drum-
mond, there was produced one night, before
a full house of dairy-farmers, Mascagni’s
“Cavalleria.” In a fine frenzy of acting
Winslow had just cast his true love from
him, and she, sinking to her knees, was dis-
solved in tears, when a voice came from
the back, charged with bitterness and loath-
ing : “Don’t cry, lady! Sue the cow !”
The Vagabonds struck what might have
proved a heap of trouble at their last produc-
tion. The play was Somerset Maugham’s
“The Unattainable,” and on the very day of
the performance Eric Howell, who was cast
for the lead, found himself sick in bed, a
stern doctor forbidding him to quit it. And
there was no understudy! Hugh Jennings
came to the rescue, and at about an hour’s
notice consented to read the part. The reading
was such a spirited and sensitive piece.
work that the audience forgot the presence
of the script. On the- second night, so quickly,
does fame travel, a well-known theatrical.'
manager and half a dozen leading amateurs
drifted along to the show. Jtnby Coxhcad did
one of her best bits of comedy work as .
Carolina, and the rest of the cast was up
to the usual Vagabond standard.
The Cecil Hoskins pair staged bridge and
jazz for the benefit of -the Ashfield Infants’
Home under their new Woollahra roof-tree.
Hillside, midway through last week. Mrs.
Arthur Crago and Airs. L’Estrange acted as
reinforcements to the hostessing of Mrs. Hos-
kins. The lounge was banked with Iceland
poppies, and in the ballroom great bowls of
roses and sweet-pea breathed their rival per-
fumes.
The Blue Bird Kindergarten has changed
its nest from Dcvonshire-street to Water-
loo, where there are many little citi-
zens who need the bluebird’s flying
feather to whisk them to happiness.
For Waterloo isn’t gay or plutocratic
or pretty, and when the new kindergarten’s
doors admit its fledglings they don’t only open
sunny colorful playrooms to the youngsters ;
they fling wide undreamed-of horizons to the
growing minds. That’s why Airs. Francis
Anderson voices her plea so earnestly for the
free kindergarten—oasis in the desert of mean
streets. The Blue Bird of Waterloo was
hatched from a nest-egg of £lOO given to the
Kindergarten Union by the late Airs. Sar-
good. Lady dc Chair blessed its flight last
week. A pictorial feature of the opening was
a flight of blue pigeons, which circled ben-
ignantly around the sun-washed roofs, and
then slid cooingly to rest thereon.
Trixie Tange's farewell concert filled the
Con. last Friday night with friends and
music-lovers. Slim Trixie, in her meagre
lace dress topped by her burnished head, sug-
gested a daffodil with a silvered stem. When
she really got to work at the keyboard,
though, siie was like a human volcano. The
big work of the evening was the Brahms
quartet in A Major; in this the pianist had
the support of Bryce Carter, Bertie Kelly
and Henry Staell. Idwal Jenkins, Philippa
Alster and Norman Jansen were others who
gave brilliant aid, and Lady Forster and
Lady de Chair were front-seaters. After the
last bouquet had been gathered in, and Trixie
had been tucked by father into a moss-green
coat with squirrel ’embellishments, three-
quarters of the audience footed it up the cir-
cular staircase and along mysterious pas-
sages till they came to the roof restaurant,
where a farewell coffee-drinking was hos-
tessed by the proud parents, with manager
George Portus as chief Alaster of Ceremonies.
The week in Brisbane -
S’Matthew vent to the Golf Ball at the R.Q. club-
house. Palm fronds outlined the arches, and brown
panels with the mystic signs of the game decked
the walls. Early spring flowers bloomed in the
ladies’ lounge, and a marquee lined with flags and
white Venetian masts concealed the supper. With
his Ex. were Mrs. Turner, General Harry Chauvel
and Mr. Knox, with Captain Saunders in charge. The
president’s wife, Mrs. George Brown, was in black
and silver; Nancy Brown chose fuchsia; and Mrs.
Theodore enlivened her black with silver. Elsie
Wareham, of Sydney, was sheathed in pearl grey, and
Jean Moore wore orchid-mauve.
Chinese lanterns, bougainvillaea and chains cf
electric lights adorned the quarter-decks, and gang-
ways draped with flags united the Sydney and
Platypus for the Naval sliivoo the other evening.
The wardroom saw the feasting. Commodore Wardle
and Jean Wardle, in black mariette, met the throng
of colonels, loots and ordinary people at the top
of tile gangway. Mrs. Melbourne Boyes wore coral-
rod and silver, and Mrs. Mutton came in black. Irma
Dearden was fetchingly frocked in ivory, embossed
in silver, with a silver girdle. Jean Cf files (Sydney)
wore wine-red.
There were quite a lot of country people still
lingering after the National Show who thought of
Ascot for the finish of the Exhibition meeting.
Amongst them were Mrs. Rockhampton Adams, in
cinnamon; Mrs. Smithfield l>" Any Winten, in black;
Mrs. Morven Hills Evans, in beige ; Enid Armstrong,
of Raceview, in pink; the Foxes of Charleville, the
Persses of Tabragalba, the Jondaryan Kents and the
Morts of Franklyn Vale. Amongst city racegoers,
were the Stanley Chapmans and Oaddell-Gairicks.
The kiddies and their mothers liked the Forster
Creche in the Show Grounds so much this year that
30 or JO chicks had to be refused admission. Lack
of room, said Miss Bedford, was the only fly in the
ointment. All the lions, worked like Trojans to look
after their charges.
The Lyceum Club gave the glad hand to the Vance
Palmers one day last week. Dr. Jean White Haney
received them, and Nettie Palmer discoursed on the
Pioneer Players of- Melbourne who perform works by
Australian authors. Vance Palmer has turned one of
Henry Lawson’s stories into a play and made a
successful job of it.
The Authors and Artists have held their annual
wong-i. Professor Stable, who already heads so many
other bodies, was made president. Emily Buleock,
Steele Rudd, Dr. Cumbrae Stewart and M. Forrest
went up as vice-presidents, E. Colclough as lion. sec.
and Ashton Murphy as hon. treasurer. Steele Rudd,
who judged the short-story competitions in connection
with tile Association, awarded first prize to J.
Devanev of Greenslopes.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The racing at Roseliill (N.S.W.) on Satur-
day was a vast improvement on that of the previous
Saturday except that punters found their task more
difficult. There were some very fine finishes, notably
in the August Handicap, 11 furlongs, in which Munro,
riding the sluggish Hermealdo (2’s) all out for six
furlongs, fairly lifted him ahead of the improving
Bowalla in the last stride or two; and in the second
division of the Dundas Handicap, where heads sepa-
rated Honan (20’s), Valamita (4’s) and Blackadder
(2’s) after a magnificent struggle. Honan, a stylish
imported chestnut by Chaucer —The Tylt—he is
trained by Pat Nailon for E. Steele —showed speed
enough to warrant his being fancied for the Epsom, in
which he has Bst., especially as he looked big, and
Blackadder also ran creditably considering that he'
had 21b. more than his Epsom weight, 9st. lib., and
can be improved at least 71b. But Valamita had more
than his share of trouble over the last half-mile,
otherwise he must have beaten Honan. The Caulfield
Cup, in which he has Bst. 21b., is said to be this
fine horse’s mission, but he will be dangerous in
any of the spring handicaps for which he has been
nominated (he is not in the Melbourne Cup) if his
owner-trainer doesn’t run the hide off him. The
first division of the Dundas Handicap was appropriated
by Hit (4’s), who was too good at the weights for
Duke Isinglass (3’s) and the fast-finishing Maoriland
gelding Pilliewinkie, for whom seven furlongs is too
short. Hit has 6st. 121 b. in the Epsom (with little
Hillier’s 3lb. allowance he had 7st. 21b. on Saturday),
and will have to be reckoned with if he keeps right.
A year or so ago he was addicted to bleeding, but
that may have , been a result of the unusually severe
track work he was asked to do ; he has been more
leniently treated since he changed hands. Each
division of the Dundas was run in lmin. 27sec.
Partly because of the money in sight and partly
because of their own fears, the bookmakers soon had
Eridanus at 6 to 4 for the Three-year-old Handicap,
six furlongs, although there were 24 starters and his
barrier number was 23. As it happened, the
favorite —he is a handsome chestnut in Ike Foulsham’s
stable, by imported King John —never got out of the
ruck, but the jockey did not punch him out when he
saw there was no hope. Amounis (B’s) streaked
away from the big field in very impressive style, the
locally-trained Somnolent (7 to 2) and the outsider
Sum King ( £6 3s. 6d. was his div. on the ss.
tote) being in the places; and now people are
wondering how good the winner is. He is a brown
gelding by Magpie—Loved One, and is owned and
trained by J. W. Cook. The Cook stable collected
again in the Parramatta Handicap, eight furlongs,
through the instrumentality of Royal Dighton (2’s),
who gave the useful Nostalgia 151 b. and a sound
beating, others behind him being old Paganini, The
Dancer, who finished very softly, Dreblah, the faint-
hearted Polynesian and the well-backed Luddenham.
Royal Dighton looks much better than he did at
Easter, and as he stays pretty well he may be
accounted a Metropolitan possibility with 7st. 71b.
Another Metropolitan candidate who was running on
encouragingly at the end of Honan’s race is Houdini.
Unless he has become tricky, as Comedy King stallions
sometimes do, he threatens danger with 7st. 61b.-
certainly he has grown into a very nice-looking horse.

Ben Chaffey withdrew Manfred from the
w.f.a. Williamstown Stakes, one mile, on Saturday,
indicating that the McCalman stable preferred
Whittier as being more forward than the three-year-
old. All the same, the son of Woorak was allowed
to go out at 7’s, The Night Patrol being favorite
at 5 to 4 on and Heroic next in demand at 4’s.
The Night Patrol was in front at the entrance to
the straight, just ahead of Heroic, who had mis-
behaved at the barrier and lost a couple of lengths,
with Whittier next. Lewis, concentrating on r he
bad-tempered chestnut, who was on his right,
allowed Duncan, on Whittier, to sneak through on tne
rails, whereupon The Night Patrol turned it up.
He has no stomach for a tight. Whittier, running
on resolutely, beat the English horse by three-
quarters of a length, and Heroic was a neck away
in third place; the three-year-old Hampden fol-
lowed after a gap of eight lengths. Heroic’s show-
ing is alleged to have satisfied his connections, but
it didn’t satisfy the public, which is getting very
tired of the overboomed beast. Palelight, though
quoted at 10’s for the Seaside Handicap, six fur-
longs, was substantially supported—it was 6 to 1
the field—and, skilfully handled by Zeally after
receiving a knock at the turn, landed the money
from Threeasta and Drina. It’s a pity more isn’t
seen of the Zeallys, Glennons, Websters, Days and
Birds on the flat; they are far superior horsemen
to some of the mannikins now in the boom. A lot
of good cash was thrown away on Sandringham in
the 11-furlongs handicap. Evidently Duncan was
expected to help the Woorak horse over the last
bit, but he closed up like a book when called upon
to make an effort. The hitherto unlucky Valbee
(6’s) finished better for H. Jones than has been his
wont for smaller boys; another unfortunate in The
Lance just failed to get on terms with him. Pengarie
was third.
“Samuel Surething”: The weather was so vile at
Williamstown that most of the bookmakers did busi-
ness in the stand. Before the Seaside Handicap
there was a hailstorm, and the wind became a gale.
“If the races were at the South Pole,” said the
man next to me, “we’d go. I rang up the secre-
tary’s office this morning and asked if they were
going to put ’em off on account of the rain. A
girl answered me: ‘Rain?’ she says, ‘rain? We
haven’t had any here!’” Just then two huge sun-
shades left their moorings, a hurrying attendant
sat down in a pool, and a violent gust along the
corridor made my companion shiver. “I wo-wonder,”
he went on, “what it’s like when it d-does rain
here!’ ’
“Hasen”: An artless individual, who
claimed that he was ignorant of breaking the law,
was impounded on the Hill at the last Flemington
meeting for making shilling sweeps on the races.
Produced subsequently at the City Court, he brought
£ 2 or seven days. Now an equally artless individual,
to wit, myself, ventures to wonder why the V.R.C.
committee should not be likewise impounded on
a charge of aiding and abetting, conniving at,
condoning, suggesting or otherwise contributing to the
performance of this heinous offence, hereinbefore
mentioned, of sweepmaking. For each of its
official racebooks contains a half-dozen or more
pages, carefully prepared and ruled off for the
purpose of this same pastime, each and every of
the above cited pages, moreover, being conspicuously
and incriminatinglv labelled to show the malicious
intent, as follows: “Sweep on August Hurdle,”
“Sweep on Apprentices’ Handicap,” and so forth.

Three veteran jumpers in Dead Centre,
Silver Heart and the ex-Westralian, Barlowerie, fought
out the finish of the Adelaide Grand National Steeple
at Victoria Park. The heavy going made Silver
Heart’s burden seem like 13st. instead of 12st., and
Dead Centre beat him home. The dead-game winner,
who injured a stifle during the race and pulled up
lame, returned a div. of £ll 15s. for £l. Other
good divs. paid during the day were £67 6s. on
Good Company in the Dequetteville Stakes, for two-
year-old fillies, and £l7 Bs. on Amberoid in the
Mayor’s Mile.

owner, and great Essendon (Vic.) full-

“The Rumpus”: At Goodwood (W.A.)
x’ecently four horses crashed down during the run-
ning of a Trial Stakes. The ambulance leapt into
action, and first-aid men stretchered the only jockey
who was out to it. Covered with rugs, he was
motored to the racecourse hospital ward, and gently
carried inside, followed by a crowd that blocked
up all the room. When the two honorary doctors
hurried over, they couldn’t get inside, and the nurse
in charge wouldn’t allow the boy to be touched until
medically examined. While she was trying to
force a passage for the doctors, the rugs moved un-
expectedly, and the patient slipped quietly off the
table. He wriggled his way between the forest of
legs and got clear. “Hold on!” shouted the doctor
who spotted him first. “I’ve got a mount in the
next race,” the victim explained, “and I want to
weigh-in. I’ll be back in a jiffy to be examined.”
“Pony Bitter” : Starting-price bookmakers
must be having a rosy time in England judging bv
the money they spend in advertising in sporting
and other newspapers. There is no law in. the
Cold Country against quoting the odds in public
prints, so advertisers take up columns with lists of
all the entrants in big races, giving the ruling market
prices against each and every nag. One learns
from a prominent London sheet published in the
middle of July that for the Doncaster St. Leger
the Derby winner Manna was at 3 to 1, with a
point longer, odds against the second favorite, Solario.
Fancy Sue and Zionist were on the same mark,
8 to 1. Of the 80 horses on the bookies’ list two
(Balfour and Cimmerian) were actually quoted at
5000 to 1, and three (Dandaloo, Fraxinella and
Mendoza) were at 2000 to 1. Twelve were at 1000
to 1. Try to imagine our local odds-crampers offering
5000 to 1 about anything!

In the second Davis Cup contest Australia
knocked out Japan, and qualified for meeting the
more formidable Frenchmen, by four matches to one.
Patterson began by winning three straight sets
against Sbimidzu (6 —1, 6 —4, 6—2), his net-play
giving him an advantage which he maintained
throughout. Anderson had more difficulty in account-
ing for Harada (6 —4, 3 —6, 6 —3, 6 —l) ; indifferent
serving lost him the second set, but he finished
brilliantly against a hard-battling opponent. Patter-
son and Hawkes settled Asia’s hash by taking three
straight sets (6 —1, 6—2, 9—7) against Shimidzu
and Harada. The match was played on rather dead
turf which had been covered against rain; Patter-
son’s irresistible smashing stands out in the reports
as the deciding factor, and the Australians lost
ouly one service. Hawkes’s proficiency was shown
more in defence; he shone in return of service and
general steadiness. The Japs, helped by the in-
accuracies that cannonading generally involves,
struggled hard in the last set, Harada showing
himself much the better of the pair, but their lobs
and placements were no match for the sterner stuff.
Patterson is alleged to have slackened somewhat in
his second single match with Harada, after the
issue had been decided; anyway, the latter beat him
6—2, 3—6, 6—l, 7 —5. Hawkes ran rings around
Fukuda, 6 —l, 6 —3, 6—o. On paper it looks as if
France held a trifle too strong a hand, but the show
against Japan, except for Patterson’s defeat by
Harada, will hearten the optimists.
“Hamer” : Jack Porter, who has dropped
into a job as professional at the Elsternwick (Vic.)
golf links, is still only 26, but when the war
started. 11 years ago, he thought himself old enough
to enlist. When he went into camp, however, his
size caused him to be put out; but, adding a few
years to his official age, he eventually got to
Gallipoli. Invalided back to Australia, he worked
his way to England as a troopship baker and, en-
listing in the British forces, saw some more active
service in Italy. His crowded life included a year
or two as a caddy in England before the war.

Until Saturday night Tenario Pelkey’s
whirling right was reckoned the funniest thing ever
seen in a Sydney boxing ring since Peter Felix
nearly knocked himself out with a right swing to
his own chin, 30 years ago, at the old Masonic
Hall. Pelkey’s speculator nearly always missed, and
often spun the walloper completely round by the
immense force of its unresisted course. On such
occasions shrieks of laughter caused the smiter to
almost blush through his dusky bronze. But Tenario
got a bit of his own back when one of these hay-
makers at last found its objective. Jimmy Allen,
the Rozelle lightweight, had been doing remarkably
well against the Filipino for three fierce rounds;
but in the fourth he was a split second late in
shifting to his right to evade a swing. It caught
him, in its downward swoop, on the side of the neck,
well round towards the back, and Jim was out on
his feet. A few fierce punches completed the job.
Havilah Uren knocked Pelkey out twice, yet Stadiums,
Ltd., has not offered the conqueror another oppor-
tunity since, while the dusky alien has had ’em in
a row, fighting almost every Saturday night. It is
a dreadful handicap to be an Australian boxer in
Sydney and a punishable offence to lick an importa-
tion.
• * * *
Szarka’s Marrickville Olympia was crowded
on Monday night when Havilah Uren and Jack
Joseph (Eng.) shaped up to one another for 20
two-minute rounds. The Englishman fought
throughout as if he feared the Australian’s left.
He hung on with his own left and “shamrocked”
with the right, while Uren was not as enterprising
as he might have been. Still, “it takes two to
make a fight,” and Joseph would not fight except
in very brief spasms. Two or three rounds were
even; the Penrith man won all the rest and the
verdict.
Those old opponents, Em Waddy and
Albert Lloyd, had another of their numerous scraps
at the Adelaide Exhibition Building on Monday night.
As a rule, they go 20 rounds, but on this occasion,
Ernest, regrettably departing from precedent, had
Albert on the floor, dead to the world, in the sixth.
A packed house at 155., 10s., 55., 3s, and 25., plus
tax, witnessed the willing but unscientific mill.

Duncan Thompson and “Nigger” Brown
were missing from the Queensland side that played
N. S. Wales at Brisbane on Saturday, but that didn’t
prevent the Queenslanders winning by 26 to 8. And
Heaven knows what the score would have been had
the rakes been reversed. Leamey hooked skilfully
for the losers, and Maker, Hardman and O’Connor
also plugged hard in the ruck, while Wearing got all
8 points—two tries and a goal. But the home team
was too good. Spencer and Aynsley, among the backs,
and Bennett and Potter, in the forwards, were con-
spicuous all day, and Craig kicked four goals. People
are still recalling that the Queenslanders, when at
full strength, were licked by N. S. Wales in the
second match at Sydney; but Rugby League foot-
ball has its humorous phases.
“Rann D.”: More dazzling football than that of
the Queensland backs in the last couple of seasons,
has seldom been shown, but there is always a danger
in this concentration on back play. It is apt to
lead to a high standard for a while and then a
decline, as the present state of Welsh football bears
witness. The hard-working forward gets no “fat,”
and consequently ambitious youths all aim at shining
behind the scrum. In Rugby football it is always
difficult to keep a proper balance between forward
and back plgy, for a machine-like lot of backs can
put up a cricket-score against weak opposition sooner
than the finest pack of forwards. But a first-class
pack can demoralise its opponents more quickly
Recentlv, in Brisbane, when the Maorilanders were
running over the Queensland forwards for a while
even Thompson, Gorman and co. showed to ven’
poor advantage, and it was easy to picture what
would have happened to these brilliant backs if they
had met some of the hefty packs of old on a wet
ground. The Maorilanders have always kept the
balance even between forward and back play, and
so their football looks a little more solid than’our.-,
even when the scores are against them.
South Sydney had to go for its life to
keep its place in the Rugby League’s City Cup
competition, which is run on the knockout principle
A minute from time South and North had 11 points
each; then Root (South) got over for Blair to
convert—l 6 to 11. North’s barraclcers relieved their
feelings by hooting the blameless umpire. Balmain
helped itself to 29 points against Uui.’s 10; Eastern
Suburbs outed St. George, 9 to 3 ; and Glebe settled
Western Suburbs, 22 to 16. The goal-kicking was
very bad, but then it has been ghastlv this season
* * * ‘ *
Showery weather in Melbourne kept many
football followers at home on Saturday, but about
20,000 visited St. Kilda to see what the unaccount-
able seasiders would do to Geelong. Two weeks
before they had “done in” their premiership chances
by losing to Hawthorn, and a victory over Geelong
would advantage them nothing; but, as it happened,
they gave their best game of the season, marking
splendidly, handling the greasy ball cleanly and
holding their opponents -with apparent ease. Tile
Geelong men, by heroic efforts, drew level in the
last quarter, but the
Saints put on a couple
more goals and won
by 62 points to 51.
Collingwood held its
position by scoring 84
points to Hawthorn’s
(iO; Essendon doing
likewise, with 69
points to Footscrav's
43. Melbourne rubbed
salt into poor old
Carlton’s wounds by
gathering 121 points
to the Blues’ 46,
Davie, the Red Legs’
diminutive forward,
kicking 13 goals; and
North Melbourne
downed South Mel-
bourne by 80 points to
58. Also Fitzroy hung
on its waning hopes of
“final” glory by notch-
ing 61 points to the
Richmond Tigers’ 55,
on a ground that was
mud where it wasn’t a
lake.
JOHNNIE
QUINN, leading
Adelaide umpire.
“Wink’: A small stature is no bar to success in
big football. Little Billy Barfoot, of Port Mel-
bourne, is the tiniest man now playing in first-
class games, yet for more than a decade he has
been the Association’s best rover. Just decimal
points over 5 feet and 8 stone, he rivals his lankier
and burlier opponents in flights for the ball, propels
it over as great distances, and in the matter of
speed and trickery leaves them far behind. When
Ports had fought their way from a low position
on the list to the semi-final against Northcote, Billy
showed unthought-of qualities of leadership. His
captain, Lewis, was disabled in the first quarter, and
the team became temporarily disorganised. Then
the midget was called on to take charge. He
fought like a tiger for the ball, battled single-
handed through a crowd of backs, and booted the
goal that gave Ports a nice lead. Thus heartened,
the side rallied, and Billy led them to an un-
expected victory. This win was so decisive that
the mussel-gatherers now expect the little ’ujy to
plan an attack that will outwit Brunswick twice
and bring them the premiership.
* * * *
“S.T. S.” : It looks as if the comic cricket
details in “The Boy in the Bush” were the work
not of D. H. Lawrence but of Miss Skinner of
Westralia, w-ho collaborated with him. For in her
new book, “Black Swans,” the lady introduces a
racquet on a lawn about 1857 ; and in her
description of a boatrace at Cambridge the com-
petitors drop their conversation with ladies on
the lawn only when “the warning bell for the race”
sounds. And her vignette of a sportsman “laying
odds on a tenner on a fine rider” is a gem.
* * * *
“Ex-Englishman” : That next England XI
(B. 23/7/’25) very nearly picks itself, on recent
form. Holmes ought to have come to Australia with
his comrade Sutcliffe ; they have a specialty of putting
up 100 for Yorkshire before the first wicket falls.
To dig them out, with Hobbs, Sandham, Woolley
and Hendren to follow, is going to give our bowlers
some trouble next year. Tate remains a good thing.
Lord Hawke said in public during the winter that
Macaulay ought to have been in the team to
Australia, “and it was entirely his own fault he was
not chosen.” Strudwick makes nine. England would
as soon think of scratching altogether as of going
into the field without an amateur for captain, and Carr,
of Nottingham, looks like being the man. No. 11 may be
any one of a dozen bowlers. Perhaps Parkin has by
this time humiliated himself sufficiently—like
Macaulay—to be taken into favor again. After his
rushing into print with complaints of the bad
captaincy that had not made sufficient use of his
bowling in the first Test at Birmingham against
S’Africa, his name was Mud. “I do not think his
claims to a place in the team for Australia were
even discussed,” says the editor of Wisden. This
same writer (S. H. Pardon) shows, by the way, that
a good Australian word is at last acclimatised in
Britain. When Middlesex and Yorkshire had a fuss
—since blown over—-last summer, “the Sheffield
public, false to all their old traditions pf good
sportsmanship, barracked for three days in most
unseemly fashion.”
THE STIFFENER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“When the N.S.W. Rugby League team met Ipswich
the ambulance men were kept busy the whole of the
afternoon. Two minutes before full-time a tussle
for supremacy was being fiercely waged when a local
player was seen to enter one of the rucks in which
some scuffling had been going on. When lie emerged
three N. S. Wales players were in an unconscious con-
dition on the ground.”
Old Snorky Mcßain we regard in the main
As a peaceful, good-tempered galoot
Who’d rather dispose of the ball with his toes
Than of other chaps’ ribs with his boot.
But when Snorky nips into the scrum
Looking grimly determined and glum,
Aye, when you espy
Tlie light in his eye
Denoting the tension’s a trifle too high,
You can bet there’ll be happenings—some.
He can dribble and heel, he can slip like an eel
Through foemen who’re guarding the goal,
But for modes more direct these arts he’ll reject
When the iron has entered his soul.
’Twill be nothing surprising, by gum!
If the field should a shambles become
When the issue’s in doubt
And the barraclcers shout,
' When the whistle will go in a minute about,
And Snorky slides into the scrum.
Will you see him emerge from the struggle and surge
With the ball at his feet in a mo. ?
Is he hooking it back to three-eighths from the pack?
Well, it may peradventure be so.
But I’ll wager a pound to a thrum
That some forms will be prostrate and numb
And a few pair of ears
Will be deaf to the cheers
That the barrackers raise when the battle-dust clears
And Snorky comes out of the scrum.
There’s a scared referee trying vainly to see,
There’s a timekeeper, ticker in hand,
Intentest of all and awaiting the call
The ambulance carriers stand.
Conjecture is heard in a hum ”
On how many chaps will succumb,
How many and who—
When the whistle is due
For the close of the game in a minute or two
And Snorky slips into the scrum.

THE INKY WAY.
An ancient pilgrim on Maoriland’s Inky Way has
just been celebrating his golden wedding. James
Mitchell was born in Wellington 78 years ago, and at
the. age of 15 was apprenticed to the printing trade.
After 63 years in the business he is still going strong
as editor of the Oamaru Mail. It was under James
that young Chris Watson, first Labor Prime Minister
of the Commonwealth, learned type-snatching.
Vance Palmer has entrusted the publication
of his “Black Horse and Other Plays,” a volume of
four one-act plays already produced but hitherto
unpublished, to Sydney J. Endacott, Melbourne. The
edition is to be limited to 250 copies, which will
be allotted to subscribers in the order they send
along their seven and sixpences. Vance is holiday-
ing in Queensland at present with his wife and
children.
“Matt Lowe”: The British Navy has its own way
of dealing with the humorist who claims the right
to look over a battleship on the ground that he is
“one of the owners” (B. 6/8/,’25). In the case where
I saw an enterprising reporter trying to work the
ancient gag, the long-suffering ship’s policeman looked
him up and down quietly, picked up a spare chunk
of teak and handed it over with “Here’s your share.
Take it home and sail your own navy in a tub.”
A dozen grinning Jackies watched an abashed young-
man climb over the side and out of their lives.
“Iford”: It is curious to note the changing wording
of birth announcements. Up to the end of last
century there was only one formula; it rah “the wife
of John Smith, a son” or “of a son.” This was
gradually displaced—possibly with the advance of
feminist movements —by “to Mr. and Mrs. John
Smith, a son.” But the spirit of change is again
at work, Glancing over a London Times* the other
day I noticed nine out of ten of these items are
chronicled this way: “to Dorothy ( nee Jones), wife
of John Smith, a son.” Apparently this is held to
make for a more impartial distribution of credit;
the bringing in of the mother's Christian name is
certainly a pleasant touch.
“Nimshi”: A while back there were inquiries in
The Bulletin for verses suitable for children. How’s
this for a sample?—
“Golden beads and poppy seeds,
And lots of sugared tea,
And honey-cake the mermaids bake
Down in the China Sea—
Oh. when my treasure-ship comes home
I’ll give them all to thee!”
I came across it in a story by old Bulletin con-
tributor James Francis Dwyer, who has been in
America for many years. He confidently predicts
that few normal children will forget the lines ai'tei
hearing them twice.
Vance Marshall, the Stormy Petrel whose flaming
tongue got him into frequent trouble —he served two
terms in gaol in N. S. Wales—has finished his
“Memoirs of. Henry Lawson” and taken them to
Europe for publication. From Perth the very re-
markable young man sends The Bulletin “my vale-
diction to my native land” :
“Australia, my homeland, good-bye! Land of
opportunity and seven Parliaments; of crowded cities
and tragic, empty Never Never —-Good-bye, Australia !
Golden radiant southland, with thy six glittering
daughters—Brisbane, Paradise and sanitary carts;
Sydney, gorgeous beaches, Suicides’ Gap, ballot-box
scandals and sunshine—good-bye ! Good-bye, Melbourne
of pompous streets, strange clustering memories of
Colin Ross and sunraysed Little Normie! Hobart,
your apples, your scenery and your relics of the
convict days; Adelaide, your peace, charm, pain-
ful preciseness, churches and Mount Lofty; and Perth
• —Perth—just Perth and your Back Beyond, from
Kalgoorlie up to Broome—Good-bye! 1 am going
to a tight little island of primroses and hedges
where the berries grow rosy red ; land of wood and
wold, land of peers and paupers, of J. B. Hobbs
and Edward Prince of Wales—England with its
nightingales, its London, its twilight, its submerged
ninth, its Rotten-row and Thames Embankment!
Australia, my homeland, good-bye!”
The best part of his 35 years lan Idriess (“Gouger”
of The Bulletin) has spent in fossicking about, old
corners of Australia. A Waverley (Sydney) native,
he put in some of his early years in the Assay Office
of the Broken Hill Prop. Co., and some at sea.
He swagged it to the opal fields at Lightning Ridge
(N.S.W.), toiled eight months without earning itne
price of a drink, but eventually found and worked
the well-known “Dead Man’s” claim, which opened
up the deeper levels of the hill whence came some
of the richest black opal finds. “Gouger” heard
about the Great War while he was on Cape .York
Peninsula, five weeks after the shindy started. With
the 6th „A.L.H. in Gallipoli, Sinai and Palestine, he
was wounded three times. On getting back he
travelled north again and began prospecting for
gold and tin around Cape York and the Barrier
Islands; with breaks at sandalwood gathering, pearl-
ing and b@che-de-mer cruises. His first novel,
“Madman’s Island,” based on an enforced stay for
seven months on a small island in the Howich Group,
is shortly to be published by Angus and Roberston,
Sydney.
THE LAST JUDGMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Uod came in judgment fearfully.
The Books were opened wide
Wherein the deeds were plain to see
Of all who lived and died.
The wide earth trembled with its dread,
The sea lay horror-still,
The graves of the most ancient dead
Were broken on the hilL
Book after book was laid unsealed
Before the fiery cloud;
And like a -wind-laid barley field
The heads of men were bowed.
A reader angel tall and fair
Lifted the first wide scroll;
The trumpets ceased and on the air
Slow bells began to toll.
None heard the words on lower earth
Which that tall angel read,
But Heaven appeared to shake with mirth
Behind its curtains red.
“Shall God have mirth of human doom?”
Men murmured in their fear,
Till sudden lightning through the gloom
Brought seas of glory near.
And through the glory came a Voice,
Familiar, warm and kind,
That bade the stricken earth rejoice
With the Eternal Mind.
“Of that man did We take no heed,
Nor that he failed to do;
But in the book wherein We read
The jests at last are new!
“For one new jest all Heaven has pined
Amid its scented gales;
We cast out Satan, stark and blind,
For telling tongue-worn tales.”
The sudden trumpets blared their joy;
Men heard the great books slain-
St Peter, laughing like a boy,
Jested with Abraham.

SHEARING MACH'S*
The fewer the delays at shearing the bigger
the return for the Woolowner; the higher the
tallies the bigger the Shearer’s cheque. Both
Owner and Shearer alike get most satisfaction
from Lister machines.
With the world’s most experienced shear
engineers constantly improving the Lister design,
the finest British material selected for its manu-
facture, its construction maintaining the standards
of accuracy and thoroughness for which English
mechanics are famous—no wonder the Lister is
now in greater demand than any other machine
throughout the woolsheds, not only of Australia,
but of the world.
The numerous attempts by other machines to imitate Lister
patented improvements brand the Lister features as of outstanding
value to the user. The Lister Self-Levelling Crown Plate, the
reinforced spindle-head, oil-cooled and oil-retaining spindle and
other handpiece improvements, the renewable friction spindle
bearing and unbreakable tube-spring on the bracket, and many
other details all serve to make the Lister the most economical plant
to install in your shed or on your portable plant. A Lister plant
is practically a guarantee against breakdown: repairs are reduced
to a minimum and, when due, cost less than with other machines.
Any practical man will soon be convinced by investigating
the details of the Lister. If installing this season you cannot afford
to pass the Lister by. Even if you are not yet needing new
equipment, you must keep yourself abreast of the most modern
developments in the shearing-machine world. We are ready to
supply the details—or the plant. Get Catalogue “B” from the
agent at the headquarters of your State or Dominion.

The ancient art of seduction is the theme
of “The Lady,” which started off to the
happy clamor of feminine applause from the
gallery at Sydney Criterion on Saturday.
The seducer in this case isn’t the usual con-
scienceless aristo who takes advantage of the
housemaid’s evolutionary urge to be a lady,
although he is disguised as one. He is the
son of a jam manufacturer who has obtained
entry to the highest circles by the simple de-
vice of changing his name from Stubbins to
St. Aubyns. Polly, a simple, honest vaude-
ville artiste circa 1898, frustrates the father’s
ambitions for his family by refusing to go
off temporarily with his son unless he marries
her. The marriage-lines are provided and he
takes her to France to learn to be a lady.
His affection growing cold before she has
forgotten not to drop her aitclies, he leaves
her when she is about to have a baby. There-
upon she drifts down through the various
lower strata of society until she reaches the
lowest. Still preserving her virtue, she
sings old English songs in a dubious caf6
for a living. The jam-maker arriving with
the news that her husband is dead, and with
an order for the custody of the child in his
pocket, she saves her infant from the fate of
being brought up a Stubbins by handing it
to a welfare worker conveniently handy. Her
subsequent quest for the child brings the
play down to 1921, when the long-sought one

(Dorothea Spinney).
wanders into an estaminet she is running at
Havre as a war hero who has lost an arm
at Arras. He accidentally kills a man in a
brawl, and when the curtain descends it is
clearly to be understood that the jury will
return a verdict of not guilty and he and his
mother will go to U.S.A. and live happily
ever after.
*** * *
The thing has all the appearance of having
been adapted from the screen. Melodrama
seasoned with bawd is the nearest definition.
William Shakspeare (1564-1616) handled a
similar theme in a play not often presented
nowadays, and his was rather a rambling
chronicle, too. He had the advantage over
Martin Brown, however, of being something
of a poet, with the ability of making his
females in distress talk poetry instead of
orangeade. The orangeade put into the mouth
of Pauline Frederick, who is the distressed
female of Brown’s play, isn’t redeemed by
the lady’s acting, which savors rather more
of the screen than in her previous perform-
ance of “Spring Cleaning.” Her armory of
tricks is apparently not as extensive as was
thought, and a tendency towards self-
consciousness was manifest. The other film
enchantress, June Elvidge, is, on the other
hand, better in this offering than the last.
She mouthed the absurdly frank sentiments
of Fanny St. Clare with vigor, and her make-
up of a chorus-girl of 1898 delighted the eye
of the antiquarian. Rose Dione, as the
keeper of the dubious cafe, provided another
bit of brightness. George Barraud, as the
jam-maker’s son, was a satisfactory bounder,
but Mayne Linton, as his father, delivered
his lines in the manner of elocution favored
by a detonating motor-bike. Charles Cole-
man may be forgiven: his part of a sentimen-
tal bookmaker would have wrecked the repu-
tation of an Irving or a Tree.

Harry Green, the Jewish comedian, is still
tickling the ribs of Sydney Tivoli groundlings
with “The Cherry-tree.” Mignonette, the
educated pony, is a noble little animal who
demonstrates his superiority to mere Gloam-
ings and Beaufords by daintily tapping out
numbers on the stage with his feet. Sydney
Moorhouse, garbed as a tramp, alternates
straight-out singing with whistling imitations
of various birds, and Fantasi adds to the
menagerie-like programme by twisting his
supple body into frog-like attitudes. Ernest
Hastings retains his popularity as song and
patter artist, and Zorondo la Bella spiritedly
pursues the self-imposed task of changing her
clothes in public.
“The Honeymoon Trail,” which the Band
Box Revue Co. is presenting just now at
Sydney Fullers’, is liberally strewn with
chuckles; two rival business men recuperat-
ing at a comic-opera sanatorium reveal a
number of hilarious details about the canned-
bean trade. Gayle Wyer and Walter Car
nock provide most of the foolery; Harry
Abdy as a Teutonic medico and Billy Bovis
as a bell-boy offer some efficient co-operation.
Pianist and monologuist Harry Waldon keeps
the house in cheerful mood with his soldier
songs and stories, while John Moore, armed
with a baritone reminiscent of burgoo and
haggis, sings pathetically of the vicissitudes
of a marine engineer. Grace and Keats
re-circulate a medley of songs long past
their early bloom. The La Marte Trio con-
tinue to endanger their young lives in trick
cycling stunts, and the restless Sadie Mac-
donald "still churns out jazz on her violin.
“The Arab” is still conducting his amorous
adventures at Sydney Hoyt’s to the delecta-
tion of flapperdom. The dusky masher has
been reinforced this week at the George-
street house by the dog actor Rin-tin-tin,
whose tail is to be seen wagging roguishly in
a superb example of mush entitled “My Dad.”
In “The Lost World,” taken from Conan
Doyle’s novel, immense prehistoric animals
stalk through the earlier part of the film
with the nonchalance of girls doing the block,
and browse among antediluvian vegetation
as contentedly as sports over counter-lunch.
The subsequent importation to London of
one of these monstrosities by an enterprising
professor, and its invasion of Piccadilly,
make a visit to the Crystal Palace well
worth while. “The Midnight Express” is
thundering to its destination at the Lyceum,
Conway Tearle is mixing with “Bad Com-
pany” at the Lyric, and what happens be-
hind “Locked Doors” at the Empress is
worth more than a glance through the key-
hole.

“Within the Law” was given an airing
at Melbourne King’s on Saturday. The
story of the shopgirl who, smarting under the
injustice of imprisonment for an uncom-
mitted theft, becomes the leader and direc-
tor of a band of crooks who contrive to stop
just short of actual infractions of the crimi-
nal code, gave Muriel Starr plenty of emo-
tional opportunities. As the unfairly vic-
timised Mary Turner who adopts this novel
method of getting home on old Gilder of the
Emporium in particular, and on the police and
society in general, she succeeded in giving
interest to the story, but the part is not very
convincing. Floie Allan, as Agnes Lynch,
scored a distinct success by a very lively
bit of portraiture. George Bryant’s Police-
inspector Burke was a good study, and
Ronald Ward figured creditably as the young
Richard Gilder who marries Mary; but
Sidney Stirling, as the father, might have
given the cold, pursy old man a warmer side
to his nature in his regard for his son. Frank
Harvey had to be satisfied with the role of
Joe Garson, Mary’s chief lieutenant in
crookedness. Harvey Adams was incisive
as George Demurest, and Carleton Stuart
made a business-like Detective-sergeant Cas-
sidy. Of the other characters in a big cast

A Melbourne art show:—
Charles Wheeler seems to be one of those fortunate
artists who have no carry-over of paintings from
one show to another. His last spring and summer
pictures are all sold, and the present exhibition at
the New Gallery, Elizabeth-street, had been open
only a couple of days when red tabs were on nearly
every other picture. Wheeler treats autumn with
its misty suggestion very well, “Burning the
Leaves” (No. 3) being particularly happy. In
“Falling Gold” (No. 9) graceful use has been made
of the fall of leaves in a parkland slightly tinted
\vith cool amber sunlight. The National Gallery
trustees have made two sound purchases, “Le Bain
de Soir” (No. 5) and “The Swimming Pool” (No.
6). “Looking Into the Light” (No. 25) is an
adventure in color; “Kangaroo Ground” (No. 25)
something slighter with sunlight well exposed, and
“The Peaceful Farm” (No. 8) is a particularly
pleasing canvas. A self-portrait, however, is a
trifle ghastly, and two other portraits are less interest-
ing than the landscape and imaginative work.
At the Athenaeum last week Edna Thomas
dispensed negro melodies in a pliant mezzo
soprano. “Ontel I Reach-a Ma Home” gave
the lady a good introduction, and there was
a rare tenderness in “Old Black Joe.” The
programme was diversified with some of the
street cries of Baltimore and New Orleans;
and there were Creole songs to show how*
the tone and, in some cases, the spirit of
the negro singing depends on whether the
English or the French were the first settlers.
Constance Piper was a sympathetic accom-
panist; and Lucille Lawrence played some
harp solos with an exquisite touch. All the
ladies were dressed in the style of the crino-
line period. There are to be further concerts
to-night (Thursday) and on Saturday.
Vice-regal patronage helped to bring the
crowd to Chuhaldin’s second concert at the
Assembly Hall; and the violinist showed a
more even quality than on his first appear-
ance. This was noticeable in “The Night-
ingale” and Tartini’s G Minor Sonata.
Numerous extras were demanded; but Chu-
haldin hardly has sufficient weight to play a
lone hand as a concert performer.

William Ileughan’s Melbourne season con-
cluded last week; considering the quality of
the entertainment more enthusiasm might
have been looked for. Heughan has a finely
sonorous voice, which he uses with dramatic
power. Hyman Lenzer showed himself a
violinist of poise and sound technique, albeit
he has not yet reached his twenties. The
youngster made his first platform appear-
ance in Ballarat, where his father, now min-
ister to the congregation of the Chosen at
Newtown (Sydney), then held a similar posi-
tion ; this was his first introduction to a Mel-
bourne audience.
The vivacity of “No, No, Nanette” shows
no falling off: at the New Princess, Mel-
bourne.
“Wildflower” on Saturday moves from
Melbourne Royal to His Majesty’s, where
there is more space for appreciative audi-
ences.
On Saturday next Maurice Moscovitch is
to re-introduce “The Great Lover’ to Mel-
bourne audiences at the King's.
Melodrama will cause the electrics at
the New Palace, Melbourne, to sparkle again
next Saturday, when Frank Neil and Maurice
Touhy will stage “The Revelations of a
Wife.” The title, at least, is promising.
** * *
A capital first part w r as presented at the
Tivoli last Saturday. It included a racy
one-act comedy sketch, “Hubby’s Aw y ay,” by
Reg Wykeham, Pressy Preston and Frank
Dunn; Will Fyffe in new acts, “The Engi-
neer” being particularly good; Jones and
Raine and Athol Tier and Peggy Ross —all
of them bright. Milton Hayes filled a large
part of the rest of the bill, using “The Mean-
derings of Monte” to uncork the laughter
bottle; but why he should spoil his success
with such dreary stuff as “Merchandise” (it
sounded like the propaganda of the Town
and Country Union) is a mystery.
** $ *
George Wallace, recovered from his ill-
ness, was back again with revue at Mel-
bourne Bijou on Saturday, “Rollicking
Revels” being the trifle. It is one of the
brightest he has so far staged. Frank Gor-
man has dropped out of the show, but Leo
Sterling, who describes himself as “The Wan-
dering Minstrel,” is ample compensation;
and Amy Rochelle remains a popular
favorite.
“The Mad Whirl,” at Hoyt’s de Luxe,
Melbourne, makes another exposure of the
unpleasant manners of Americans who have
money to waste, the most satisfactory por-
tion of the pitcher being the horsewhipping
of the hero by the heroine. “No Trespass-
ing” is the supporting film. The Australian
picture, “Painted Daughters,” holds pride of
place at the Majestic. It is pretty bad, but
no worse than many imported films. “What
Shall I Do?” is the most noticeable other
film; and the Campbell Boys supply a musi-
cal and humorous interlude with the aid of
concertinas.
AT MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
Will Fyffe in “I’m Ninety-four To-day” and
“I Belong To Glasgow.” Gus Fowler,
the watch king.
Thurston Hall concluded a good season at
Adelaide Royal with a neat speech of grati-
tude, saying that if ever he has a daughter
he will name her after the city; ‘‘but I may
have to name him Sydney.” His swaggering
Mexican general in “The Broken Wing” is
a fine rendering, and Gladys Webster gets
a big chance, too. But the play is heavily
damaged by the last two minutes, which turn
the deserted wife into a mere female detec-
tive, and thus brand with insincerity all the
emotional interest. In pictures, the York
has Harold Lloyd at his best; also an un-
boomed but funny story of a nigger and a
(real) lion on the parapet of an umpteen-
storey building. West’s, too, is unusually
strong in its film of a masterful wild horse
and his ultimate friendship for man. (If
an animal “registers” an emotion, he is feel-
ing it; no glycerine tears for him.) George
Cross, at the Prince of Wales, sinks his iden-
tity finely in the part of I'agin; Rutland
Beckett gets a big chance as Sikes, Leslie
Adrienne as Nancy, and Mary Anderson as
Oliver Twist. And really good concerts are
everywhere.

“Bill Bile”: 1 have an idea that “The
Pelican” would stand a better chance in Aus-
tralia if it were re-christened. The play
is quite a good one, but the title isn’t. The
night 1 visited it various country members
of the audience in my vicinity audibly com-
plained at curtain-fall that the bird had not
been shown on the stage all the evening.
I soothed them by explaining that the;-fowl-
impersonator was out of the bill on account
of a sore throat; and they said they would
come again the next night. I was not pre-
sent the next night.
“Hamfat”: Jack Cosgrove (B. 20/8/’2o)
wrote up his memories of the stage with the
hope of seeing them published in book form
before the curtain fell. They appeared in
the now defunct Melbourne Evening Sun
and one of flip Adelaide dailies. But Jack’s
narrative was mainly a chronicle of the
people with whom he had played, and left
out those jesting yarns he could tell best, and
didn’t mind telling even when they were
against himself. He was a jester who
couldn’t help taking life as a joke, even
when it had given him many reminders that
it resented that sort of treatment —-his habit
of playing tricks lost him several good stage
jobs. When the first Actors’ Union was
formed in Sydney it was John who planked
down the first half-crown entrance fee and
became No. 1 on the list of members. “And
SAMPLE WANTED.
THE ARTIST : “May I show you a few
sketches? I am a comic artist.”
THE ESITOR: “Oh. are you? Then make me
laugh !”
I really did pay it,” lie would say when re-
calling the incident.
“Hamfat”: 1 gather from the publicity
merchant that a lot of our stage stars don’t
really like the hectic life of the theatre.
Some have a passion to settle on the land;
others yearn to become painters; and one
adventurous spirit aspires to purchase a
vessel and travel the world and the islands
thereof as a “trader.” None expresses a
consuming desire to become a plumber, a
tiickpointer or a municipal garbage contrac-
tor; such occupations are devoid of the
romance with which theatrical tradition sur-
rounds the farm, art and the sea. This
pretence of a strong aversion from the fierce
limelight that beats on a mummer grows
tiresome, but it is easy to understand that
many of these posers - started in other call-
ings and only reached the stage by “acci-
dent.” as they explain. Accident is, after
all' the best explanation of their presence
there.
“XD”: The manager of a Melbourne, hotel
ruefully recalls an Italian grand-opera per-
former who had a tendency to boil over with
emotional indignation, always leading off
with a reminder to all and sundry that he
was a g-r-reat ar-r-teest, not one of the
canaille, and vowing vengeance for imaginary
affronts. One day there was a commotion in
the dining-room, and the manager approached
the excitable foreigner for an explan-
ation. “Vot eet ees?” shouted the Dago. “Eet
ces an insnlt-a! Eet ees an out-a-rage!. I
am dear-r-tees verra gr-reat ar-r-teest!
An’ I like-a my staka not vell-a da-done. I
like-a boom vot you call-a r-raw ! An’ they
bring-a me— me! —that!” The indignant
singer got his steak half-raw thereafter, hut
the hotel was glad to see the last of him.
“Filkoil” : The iate-supper, cocktail-drink-
ing. cigarette-smoking kind of reputation
actresses get and sometimes deserve does not
tit Nellie Bramley. Ma, pa or one of the
family always called at the Melbourne Palace
to escort the leading lady home in the days
when Nellie played a weekly bill in melo-
dramas like the “Midnight Express” and
"The Girl Who Took the Wrong Turning”;
and every night a crowd of factory-girls
paid court at the stage door. Nowadays,
thanks to her manager-husband Russell
(cousin of the late Senator Russell), her
plays run longer and arc of a much better
type. She owes much to an intellectual and
sympathetic mother, who, besides tending the
ehilder, also took the greater part in run-
ning an Ascot Vale chemist shop.
"E.T.”: Noel Coward (B. 18/8/’25)
lately published three of his plays in one
volume, “The Hat Trap,” “The Vortex” and
“Fallen Angels.” Like Bernard Shaw, he
starts off with a provocative preface which
he calls “A Reply to My Critics.” That the
young man lacks nothing in the valuable
quality of self-confideuce may be gathered
from this quotation: “Although a good deal
of success has come to me early in life, I
definitely consider my present work to be no
more than a very tentative first step forward
towards what I hope and intend to achieve
in the future.” Coward was a boy-actor
before the war, and returned to the stage
after a year in khaki (he was caught up in
the conscription of 1917) to appear as Bob-
bie in his own play of “I’ll Leave It to You."
He was not then 21.
“D.E.”: Harrison Owen, formerly a pro-
lific contributor to the Poverty Point column,
has had a comedy, "The Gentleman-in-
Waiting.” produced in London after a'trial
spin in the. provinces. His Fleet-street
brethren are kind to the Australian’s first
attempt, the Daily News describing it as “a
witty play,” the Manchester Sunday
Chronicle as “quite a witty little comedy,”
and the Daily Sketch as “one of the bright-
est comedies in town”; but they arc not
nearly so indulgent to the producer, and
Cecil Humphreys, who was in Australia
about 18 months ago with Oscar Asche, is
slated for his impersonation of a literary
critic. Reading between the lines Owen
hasn’t quite hit the bull's-eye. but the West-
minster Gazette suggests that he may do
it next time.
“Flaming Youth”: Constance Evans, of
the "No, No, Nanette” co. is no great
shakes at singing or speaking
lines, but her dancing inclines
one to believe the managerial
assertion that difficulty was ex-
perienced in getting the lady
away from engagements in Noo
Yoick. An Australian (her pa
was in the horse-racing busi-
ness), she and a sister made a
few appearances in Melbourne
theatres; but the pair got no
permanent standing, and Con-
stance sought a steadier job in
America. Now she has come
back again everybody is prepared
to believe the great things that no one
previously said about her.
“Lysander”: Press-agenting is not the
skilled business it once was. There lias
arisen a newer stereotypy- —the actress who
dotes on motoring (name of car in block let-
ters), on creche babies (mention Somebody’s
Soap), or horses (picture of Bivalve being
stroked on the nose) ; and the actor who
golfs (grotesquely when the camera is look-
ing) or plays burlesque football for obscure
charities. In Melbourne the latest stunt, is
to perform for the benefit of animals at the
Zoo. Gladys Webster got herself clawed
by a tiger cub in the sacred cause of pub-
licity ; and Marie Burke has sung to a small
python held in her dainty hand, and tickled
the palate of the hippopotamus with a hand-
ful of hay. It is all very thin and footling,
and one sighs again for the lost jewels and
the never-ageing babies.
“Gouger” sees a show:—
When the Nile comes down with life-giving silt
each year the alleged descendants of the Pharaohs
rejoice. Our regiment was riding through an outlying
Delta village when the ceremony of Abu Nerus was
on. The star actor .sported a robe of startling- color,
an enormous, fool's cap and a dummy sceptre, while
his ugly brown face was almost hidden by a. profuse
beard. He was followed by a laughing crowd < f
natives, dressed as scribes, hangmen, moneylenders
and cavicatui'es of various other pests, ail making
for the headquarters of the village magistrate. Arrived
there, Abu held court, his attendants carrying on with
mock but boisterous authority. The real magistrate
was lugged up, and the tongue-banging he got made
bis eyes bulge. Then it was the turn of the police
and lawyers of the village. The hangmen was sen-
tenced to be hanged, the gaoler to receive “life” in
his deepest and filthiest coll, and the mean man of the
village to pay a fabulous ransom. Anyone who bad
a grudge against someone in authority could have
him placed on “trial,” and all the sentenced ones
had to part with baksheesh before they were par-
doned. At the finish a burlesque Was enacted of .the
burning of Abu Nevus himself. And then the troops
rode on.
“C.K.” : One night (luring the first week
of “Utopia, Ltd.,” at the London Savoy,
A'. W. Wood, a pantomime writer with whom
J had a slight acquaintance, came into my
dressing-room and asked me to read a well-
printed libretto of “Utopia,” written by him-
self, and “regretfully returned” by D'Oyly
Carte some months before. The opera was
on the same lines as Gilbert’s, and the names
of several of the principal characters were
identical. 1 was certain then, as lam now.
CHANGED HIS FAME.
“Who is the noodle?"
“He's the prim a donna's husband."
“I know that! But who was he before she married him ?"
that Gilbert would never deliberately annex
another man’s ideas and characters, but it
was a very strange coincidence to say the
least of it. There were two obvious reasons
why this Savoy opera did not achieve as
great a success as its predecessors (B.
13/8/’25). One was that the Royal Family
did not like being made to appear “cheap”—-
that was Princess Louise’s expression after
the first performance. Incidentally, the
Prince of Wales (afterwards Edward VII.)
insisted on Barrington removing from his
costume the Order of the Garter. The other
was the weakness of the leading lady, Nancy
Mclntosh, about whose re-engagement G. and
S. subsequently disagreed. In the English
provinces “Utopia, Ltd..” with Harry Lytton
as King Paramount, was as great a success
as any of the others.
“Hamer”: Alec Carroll does not need to
wait down here many years more to be
the old man amongst Melbourne theatrical
house-managers, for he has been in the theat-
rical game since he was a boy, and that’s 40
years ago. He is an encyclopaedia of infor-
mation about Poverty Point in the last half-
century, and has been somehow associated
with practically all the theatres. For a long
time now he has presided over the destinies
of the Bijou. To watch his chin go out, as
he looks at a first performance, is to get a
very much better index of something jarring
in the show than is given by the sounds or
silences amongst the audience, which quite
frequently approves any dashed old thing.
“Amitv”: In his comment on “Spring
Cleaning,” “R.D.K.N.” (B. 13/8/’25) over-
looked one important point in which an all-
British cast would have improved the play.
The English Lady Suzanne, in the Sydney
production at least, is made to appear de-
cidedly French. As her title is one that a
girl must be born to it is most unlikely that
the holder would speak with a strong French
accent. But the American on both screen
and stage often comes to grief over the intri-
cacies of British titles.
“Ancient Prompter” : “Fair and Warmer.”
now having a second run in Sydney, did not
make a deep impression on its firs% appear-
ance, and few people seem to remember it.
On its first night at the. Criterion nine years
ago the audience was inclined to think the
piece rather warmer than fair; but that, as
I say, was nine years, ago. We have had
some-training since, then. Percy Marmont. now
one of the most-sought-after picture stars at
Hollywood, was leading man of the co. and
the piece was staged by George Highland—
his first production in this country, by the
way.
“Hamfat”: An old Melbourne playgoer
has a memory which goes back to Joseph
Jefferson. Joseph's performance in “Ilip
Van Winkle” he reckons the most delightful
of his long experience; “I saw it in the
’sixties at the Haymarket, or it may have
been the Princess’s,” he says. "Hip Van
Winkle” has been played very little in Aus-
tralia, but the “book” reads like one that
would make a hit in a revival if we have a
manager enterprising enough to make tin-
experiment. The Haymarket referred to
stood in Bourke-street, near the Eastern
Market. It became the Duke of Edinburgh
later, and was burnt down in 1873.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Melodrama unashamed,
but less naked than musical comedy or revue,
is due to arrive in Melbourne when Frank Neil
re-opens the Palace Theatre on Saturday. We
have had many plays that could hardly be
distinguished from undo- but for
the management’s saying they
were something else; but this
season may yield drummers of
the good old meaty sort. "The
Revelations of a Wife” is the
opening bill. It is expected that
till the Melbourne ladies now
making knee-high disclosures
will rush it.
“The Major": I remember a
Maoriland show that started
even later than 10 p.m. (It.
t»/8/’2f>). About 2o .years ago
Fitzgeralds’ Circus finished a
season at Auckland on a Satur-
day night. Brothers Dan
and Tom had arranged to
appear at Whangarei on the
Monday and Tuesday nights;
but a heavy nor’-east gale
kept the little paddle-steamer
they had chartered for the
trip—the Terranora—-weather-
bound till Monday morning, so
the show did not arrive at
Whangarei until close on mid-
night. But the pretty town was
alive with timber-getters, gum-
diggers and outside Maoris, all
gathered to see the circus. The
Fitzgeralds were not the men to
disappoint them. Up she went.
The show started at 2 a.m. and
finished at 4.30. Two other per-
formances were given, one be-
ginning at 2 p m. and the other
at 7 p.m., and the circus was
afloat on the return journey by
a littlo after midnight. I'rices were ss. and
(is., and the huge tent was packed each per-
formance.
“Yarra Ben": The pitchers are of some
use occasionally. A Melbourne beauty
specialist trading as Du Barry, Ltd., leased
his Collins-street parlors to a lady barber,
appropriately named Cutts, and moved over
the way. Presently lie was chagrined to find
that Miss Cutts, according to eye-stabbing
signs, had called herself Du Pre, thus, he
considered, leading the public to believe that
the original beautifier was still carrying on
business at the old address. On this account
Du Barry asked the Law to grant an injunc-
tion to restrain Du Pre from using that
name, and spoke of damages. The Judge
asked defendant’s counsel how his client,
with all the world to choose from, came to
hit upon Du Pre? Counsel quite seriously
replied, “She got it from the pictures."
Which reminds me that I once met a very
foreign-looking Rickards turn—a top-of-the-
bill gymnast—who called himself “The Great
Pericles.” I ventured to ask him if the
name was his own. “No,” he answered in
broad Cockney, “I got it orf a ship in Lunnon
docks.”
Some treasure-trove:—
Captain Shirley Falcke has been searching in
Australia for old European masters, and the loot lie
has secured is at present on show at the Hotel Aus-
tralia, Sydney. It consists of half a dozen pic-
tures ascribed to Rembrandt, Van Dvck, .Jan Steen,
Turner and others. The Rembrandt was rescued
from the flies in a Brisbane lodging-house. It is
either a copy or the original painting for a certain
poor etching of the master which is world-famous
on account of the inclusion of a rude dog. The
previous original, with the dog omitted, is in the
Wallace collection, and has lately been ascribed
to someone else. The chances of the Australian
find being worth £30,000 or so are therefore good ;
although it may be argued that a creative crafts-
man such as Rembrandt would hardly have copied
his own painting with such slavish fidelity as is
indicated in the etching. The Captain has had a
foretaste in Melbourne of the battles lie will have
to fight in Europe, but he has gained heart from
the fact that a picture found in the office of a
Sydney business man and forwarded to New York
has there been acclaimed by (!. Frank Mullet, a
noted tJ.S.A. authority, as a genuine effort of a
pupil of the mighty Leonardo.

He’d hurl them from the pit.

Rut no rude man, to give offence,
A scornful glance had shown.

case battery.
And what is more, the CRR is insulated
with the justly famous Willard Threaded
Rubber. This very different insulation lasts
for the entire life of the plates of the battery,
or it is replaced gratis by any Willard
Service Station.

No notice (except of a ■hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
McDuff: Although your bushie had never
seen a wireless before, we’re glad to observe he’s a
diligent reader of The B W.C.L.S.: Too soon to
resurrect that topic.... T.F.: Can’t trace derivation
of the word; possibly an aboriginal source....
Wiremu: Interesting historically, but unable to use
it.... Mossy Dell: A vein of fancy that is worth
developing; but you’ll need a lot of practice with
your pen... .Glen A.: Get down off your stilts. For a
start, when you’ve used a polysyllable, see if you
can’t find a single syllable that will do as well. Most
times you may find half a dozen that will do better.
. ...G.A.C.: But almost any'encyclopaedia would tell
us all that....H.W. (Rockhampton): There is not
much wrong with the writing, but a general wail of the
lost love doesn’t make a tale....D.L. (Springwood),:
Don’t know whether anything could be made of the
idea, but the present attempt is feeble. .. .Iris A.:
All the old mechanical properties are there, but
the yarn hasn’t the touch of reality... .P.H.8.: That
sort of thing has been done too often. .. .Poeta:
Horrible.. . .Estelle T.: Not quite enough interest.
. ...F.N.W.: Too long for its material... .A.D.M.:
The “Triangle” yarn is not convincing... .D.M.G.:
“Night Song” is fair verse, but it gets to nothing
and the note is not fresh John R.: The verses
are of the plodding sort that has too little regard
for metre... .A.L.M.: It takes too long to get to
the point and when it arrives the point is 5ma11....
A. : Too loose and 10ng.... Cygnet: Poor, with
no lift in it... .D.F.AV.: Rambles all over the place.
.... Jos. S.: The attempt to drag forth humor is too
obvious T.J.S.: Goes very heavily... .D.F. (a,asc
Melb.): Fluttered weakly towards the tomb....
M.A.L.: “Morning” must go back... .Cecil D.:
Waddles on through an ocean of commonplace with
the smallest possible number of rhymes and a pain-
ful jolt in every second line.... A.L. (Parramatta):
Highly moral verse very badly constructed.... Jonah:
Very p00r....A.H.H.: Not enough marrow in its
bones. .. .F.F.A.: Doesn’t strike us... .L.S.A.: All
choked with commonplaces and print-worn tags....
E.C. (Brisbane): Can’t find it a place... .M.8.P.:
Nice idea, but the verse doesn’t quite carry it....
B. (Wellington); “The Listeners” is too thin....
E.M.: The verses carry a fine enthusiasm:—
Australian land continent,
Blessed with perfume in all extent,
Blessed gardens wild of beauty grand,
food for our sense this Pleasant land,
the tree Musk of great Bundanoon,
the scent it greets the roamer soon;
The tree Moss sheen and red waratar,
the beauties of Austialia are.
On rocky heights they flourish well.
Which on the east from Inverell.
from whence the Clarence draws her might.
the Razor-back’s fall face daylight.
Horse leeches through the water reeds,
and cattle-tick in plenty breed;
the forest grand, the tree-fern sheen,
the undergrowth are ever green.
.... Ripponlea: That’s right; Australia can't afford
to lose you:—
When th’ rain down flows
And th’ wind loud blows,
And th’ last ling’ring fly
Of Autumn doth die;
That is th’ Season I don my golosh,
As through pools and puddles I painfully slosh,
Lest I go to bed when th’ day doth close,
Suffering from a cold i’ th’ nose.
Now, say I’m i’ a warm room ;
Then go out i’ th’ gloom;
And there’s atall any. breeze
I’m liable to sneeze!
So I generally sit where th’ fire doth dazzle;
And but intermittently get out cn th’ razzle;
Lest when th’ day doth close I go to bed
Suffering from a cold i’ th’ head.
But when th’ Sun is out
Do I amble about.
If it rains I meander
To th’ nearest verandah;
And hang about till th’ rain goes off,
For I hate to mayhap develop a cough,
To bed I go when the day doth close, lest
I suffer from a cold i’ th’ chest.
. ...D.M.S.: Verse that merely describes a scene in
.superlatives is hardly ever worth while.... Learner:
The ballad is poor verse used to tell a poor tale.
... .W.8.M.: The mild lady leaves us quite cold. ...
E.L. (Paddington); The matter is too slight, the
form too p00r... .D.M.F.: Doesn’t make a yarn....
Jackadgery; Good. We can put up with a deluge
of pars like that... .Peter M.; Somewhere on the
road, but still a long distance off the camp....
J.J.S.; Find something real to write about... .A.B.
(Katoomba) : The same old tired theme in the same
old tired verse.... The Pivot: The tale gets so
tangled that it isn’t easy to find out what has
happened... .D.M.A.: Can’t remember it, but it’s
not hard to guess its fate if it was anything like
the present sample... .H.A.N.: Don’t try the sonnet
form till you get more skill in verse construction....
John H.: Cheer up. Life isn’t quite the dismal thing
those bad rhymes suggest.... Marie O.: Don’t believe
you are nearly so anxious to go to Heaven as you
pretend... .F.H.M.; Impossible to say from samples
whether you could learn to write or not. The first
thing necessary is to take some trouble... .JfA.D.:
The verse is thin and that violent way of bumping
out the rhyme destroys melody... .A.E.M.: The lines
are correct enough, but the ideas are weak and not
improved by the tags of moral commonplace....
B. J.A.: It is difficult to say new things about the
sea, but it is hardly worth while sorting out the
most tiresome and putting them in rhyme... .W.H.R.:
“Inconstancy” misses... .F.P.X.M.: The verse is very •
lumpy and crude... .C.R.S.: Not bad, but not good
enough... .E.8.G.: Too staggering and clumsy....
Ole Blue: The lament lacks freshness and the verse
is poor in quality... .F.C.E.: It has a hint of
something worth while, but no more.... A.E.8.:
You have an idea in “Black Magic.” Now, see if
you can’t work it out better... .E.E. (Coogee):
What’s the use of saying a few of the most obvious
things about the sunrise that has had a million
things said about it?
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
COItRESPON DENTS.
V.8.T.: That sort of thing has to be ever so much
better done... .A.M.C.: Point got rubbed off in
the post, apparently... .W.H.D.: You have some way
to go, but your feet seem to be on the track....
W.D.F. : Not a flicker in it T.S.: Nobody but the
artist would expect the car to go H.S.: As
rough yet as a springless dray, but promising....
W T .R.: Sincerely sorry we can’t use your hardwood
fragment W.McM. ; Not so bad, but off our
beat.... E.8.M.: For resurrecting that gag you
deserve to be flung into a seamen’s meeting dis-
guised as Havelock Wilson.

Australia Endorses Figures don't lie,
i ci; i i i r Studebaker ship *
the New btudebakers l mentsto Australia
for the first 4 months of 1925 were 46.7 per cent
greater than during the same period of 1924•
These figures tell their own uncoloured story —of
how the Australian public has placed its unqualU
fied approval on the 22 neiv Studebaker models.

CONSIDER how many different
nationalities inhabit the globe.
Different manners, different cus-
toms, different languages and dif-
ferent opinions—except as regards
motor cars.
For all nations have agreed on the
thorough excellence of the new
Studebaker models proved by
record-breaking sales in all parts of
the world.
See the new Duplex body, an ex-
clusive Studebaker innovation,
which combines the advantages
of both an open and an enclosed
car. Convertible from one to the
other in but 30 seconds—-by merely
lowering or raising roller side
enclosures.
See the host of refinements on the
new Studebaker models—the light
control on the steering wheel, the
new type emergency brake operated
from the dash, the grouping of all
instruments under glass, the genuine
balloon tyres with specially designed
steering gear, springs and mud-
guards.
See the new Studebakers! Then
you will appreciate why they have
won the endorsement of motor car
buyers everywhere.

“Coot” : There must sometimes be a bit of
protit in doing something for nothing, other-
wise four firms of undertakers wouldn’t have
expressed their readiness to provide free
funerals “as required by the Government”
for destitute persons dying in Melbourne
for the period from August 1, 1025, to June
30, 1920. Outside of the metropolitan area
the amount charged for such services varies
from a couple of pounds to six guineas.
* * * *
“Chhota Peg”: Whatever may be the case
with Welsh briquettes, there is no danger
such as “Te Babarantiko” mentions (B.
30/7/’25) in handling the Yallourn (Yic.)
product. These contain no binding matter
which might hurt the skin of those handling
them. They are pure brown coal, and no
extraneous material is needed to bind it. The
method used is to disintegrate the coal, dry
it thoroughly, then introduce a carefully cal-
culated quantity of water, the resultant pro-
duct being pressed into the shape it holds
until it reaches the grate.
* * * *
“Hopalong”: They are pretty casual on
the Queensland railways. Some time ago
a cargo of fat cattle was unloaded at the
Gladstone meatworks’ yards, and the empty
trucks were shunted ’back to Gladstone,
where they remained for a day or two prior
to being sent to Rockhampton. There, a
few days later, the trucks were being shunted
to make up a train for the West when a
noise attracted attention. It came from a
live bullock, which had evidently been missed
when the cattle were unloaded almost a week
before. It had also evidently been over-
looked by the men who cleaned out the empty
trucks in the Rockhampton yards.
* * * *
. “Adamascus”: After exhaustive investiga-
tion of the railways and tramways in the
Commonwealth, a special Maori land railway-
officer has recommended the Rockhampton
(C.Q.) system of steam trams as the best
for use in the Dominion. The cars, which
seat 40 passengers and attain a speed of
40 m.p.h., can haul a trailer carrying an
equal number of passengers at a working
cost of under Is. per mile per car. They
are best for runs up to 20 miles in length,
with frequent stops, and are much in advance
of the petrol-car, which has been proved un-
suitable on suburban lines. The Rockhamp-
ton cars have already been adapted by the
Queensland Railway Department for use on
the ordinary railway line, and are doing good
work in the suburban districts.
* * * *
“Jobber” : I agree with “C.0.M.P.” that it
is hard to get Australian-made goods (B.
16/7/’25). Take matches. After futile
attempts to buy (1) Australian or (2)
English, I went so far as to write to the
Melbourne factory which produces what I
searched for. I pointed out that in this
particular town, with dozens of stores, it
was impossible to get the dinkum stuff, and
even mentioned the two storekeepers who
have the privilege of waiting for my cheque
each month. That was many moons since,
but the storekeepers are still sending the
Scandinavian stuff. My wife gets annoyed
when I say “Don’t take the foreign matches,
send ’em back” ; she looks at me as though
to suggest I inhabited a different planet, and
coldly reminds me of what I told the match-
man in Melbourne. I then fade away to the
fowl-yard, and wonder how we are ever
going to become a nation, with the importing-
fever so deeply planted in the blood and bones
of our business houses.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: A butcher usually under-
stands that his business is to sell meat, and
a waiter has a rudimentary notion that he
is expected to serve soup; but in my experi-
ence the attendant of the seductive-looking
depots which have been set up in the various
cities with the object of luring holiday-
makers to other States has no realisation
of the fact that he is supposed to sell infor-
mation. He greets inquiries as to the
weather, communications and advantages of
his sun-kissed, sun-washed or sun-smitten
province with the startled suspicion of one
who has been asked for a permit to throw
bombs at civil servants. While his depart-
ment is expending thousands in rose-tinted
prospectuses calculated to draw a long-
established angel out of Paradise, he busies
himself in casting over the intending tourist
the blanket of his own unutterable disillu-
sionment. I awoke this morning full of plea-
sant anticipations of an expedition to a part
of this continent reported to be overflowing
with milk, honey and sensational scenery; T
emerged from an interview with the local
representative'of the State in question with
a conviction that a holiday spent in trench-
ing the garden for late-flowering sweet-peas
would be more amusing. Exactly how much
money is saved by the citizen owing to
this peculiarity of the Intelligence Bureau
employee would make an interesting calcula-
tion.
A MATTER OF CONVERSATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Britain has asked Fiance for the repayment of
war loans. The French Government has replied that
it is willing to renew conversations on the subject
at an early date.”
When Billings brings his paltry bill
And asks for payment due,
A touch of diplomatic skill
Will see the matter through.
Don’t tell him “something will be paid,”
Mor settle on the spot,
Nor even hint that you’re afraid
lie cannot have the lot.
Just mention, in a casual way,
That in a week or two
You might, with good luck, find a day
With little else to do
When, if he cared to have a walk
Or else to just sit still,
You would begin a little talk
About his nice long bill.
W hen treated so, beyond a doubt
All grocers would grow tame.
The present way they range about
.Makes debtors hot with shame.
The Gallic plan is sweeter far
And suits a gallant nation;
For francs that were and francs that are
Make pleasant conversation.

First wash away any dirt or grit from the
wound; cover it with a piece of lint or any
bit of clean rag on which Zam-Buk has been
spread. Rub gently with Zam-Buk for
bruises and sprains. Then cover up
(especially in burns and scalds) and let
nature and Zam-Buk do the rest.
TEST
FREE
The proprietors of Zam-Buk invite you to
make a free test before buying. Simply
send your request to C. E. Fulford (Aus.),
Ltd., Sydney, and a trial sample will be
sent you by return mail free and post paid if you
mention The Bulletin- of 27/8/’25.
ACCIDENTS in the home occur when least expected—the slip with
the knife or tin-opener —the hot oven door against your bare arm
the kettle that boils over —the bruises and bumps of play, and the
children’s cuts and hurts.
Injury to the skin means a
breaking of the protective layer
and the admission of hordes of
harmful germs that set up a
kind of local poisoning. There-
fore, be ready to apply at once
to any injury a piece of lint
or clean rag smeared with
Zam-Buk, and keep the place
covered up.
This antiseptic balm kills
disease germs, draws out all
poisonous matter, soothes pain
and quickly ends what is a
peril to even healthy people.
If you had the eyes of a microscope
and could see Zam-Buk knitting the edges
of a wound together you would witness
one of Nature’s miracles—the creation
cell by cell of new living tissue. You can
always feel safe in accident or skin trouble
with a box of Zam-Buk close at hand.
Tt is important to select Zam-Buk for your
regular liome first-aid and healer, because Zam-Buk
means “safety first.” Unlike ordinary ointments
Zam-Buk contains no coarse mineral drug or rancid
animal fat to corrode or harm the skin. Zam-Buk
has proved as wonderfully effective in cases of
eczema, pimples, rashes, poisoned sores, ringworms,
piles, ulcers and deep-seated disease as it is sooth-
ing and healing for cuts, burns, scalds, etc.

WRITE FOR ILLUSTRATED BOOKLET, BOX 555 G.P.O. SYDNEY, N S.W.
“Privateer”: Admiral Magruder, of Uncle
Sam’s light-cruiser squadron, has been
weighing them up. He says the finest har-
bor in the world is Rio, with Hobart second,
and Sydney third. But Rio’s first place
only relates to scenery; as far as facilities
for shipping are concerned the Brazilian
port is beaten by the Speck's capital.
“Gwydir”: The comedy was recently
staged at the Warialda (N.S.W.) pound-
yard, the principal actors being two stray
prads, one poundkeeper and two kids, whose
combined financial resources were 3d. Bid-
ding began, and ceased, at 3d., at which
the first steed fell under the hammer. The
kids wouldn’t increase the figure for the
second moke, so he, too, w r as sold at 3d.—
on tick.
“Flicker”: Be Captain Cook’s children.
My authority differs from “Ancient Mariner”
(B. 6/8/’25) as to the death-place of the
youngest of the three sons who have been
mentioned. In William H. G. Kingston’s
“Captain Cook: His Life, Voyages and Dis-
coveries” (London, 1S68) it is recorded that
Hugh, the youngest, died at Oxford while
studying for the Church. It is added that
the mother, on learning of the death of her
last son, destroyed all her husband’s letters
so that she might not be reminded of the
past.
Dr. Robert Grant, the Mackay (N.Q.) boy
who got his F.R.C.S. at Edinburgh the
other day, has packed adventure too into his
short life. Scholarships lifted him from the
State school in Mackay to the Townsville
Grammar School and the Queensland Uni.,
and from the Sydney Uni. to Scotland. He
saw the first round of the war through with
the Black Watch, and the second as an
interpreter in East Africa, coming back to
further study which led him on to the im-
portant job of superintendent of Hull In-
firmary,
M. J. Clarke, Adelaide bookseller, cele-
brated last week the jubilee of his arrival in
S.A. He has had close on 60 years in the
trade, starting with George Robertson in
Melbourne, and being sent to open an Adel-
aide branch in 1875. F. W. Preece, his
chief but friendly rival to-day, was on the
same staff. He lias since been manager for
Petherick, Cole, Robertson again, Rigby, and
now, in conjunction with the two Becks, runs
a Cole’s bookshop and library in the Rundle-
street premises known for many years as
Wigg’s.
Herbert Heaton, who leaves the Economics
job at Adelaide University for a better one
in Canada, is a teacher Australia will find
hard to replace; and a great deal of criti-
cism, Parliamentary and otherwise, has been
levelled at the Council and Board of Com-
mercial Studies for letting him go. The
truth seems to be that Conservatism has
exerted its pull in both bodies, and the little
man who thought too much, saw too much,
and insisted on saying something of what he
believed, received no encouragement to stay.
So S.A. loses one of the cheeriest grins it has
ever seen.
“Bloodhound”: Does the Taxation Depart-
ment really have to be as mean as this? A
request was sent to the Department at Bris-
bane for an extension of time for payment
in the case of a Bundaberg (Q.) taxpayer
who was too ill to attend to business mat-
ters. A month’s extension was allowed, and
two days after it expired the man died.
His widow paid the tax out of her private
funds a few days later, instead of letting
the Department wait until the estate was
being administered. She got in return a
receipt and a demand for payment of a fine
for dilatoriness.
“Nothing Matters” : All through the visit
of the American Fleet leading men insisted
on referring to our visitors as Anglo-Saxons.
The truth is that of 115,000,000 inhabitants
in the U.S.A. to-day 35 per cent, are Brit-
ish or of British descent; the other 65
per cent, represent 36 European nationali-
ties and other continents, including
15,000,000 African negroes. In 1923, of
522,919 immigrants to the United States,
only 61,499 came from the United Kingdom,
and half of these were Irish; the Anglo-
Saxon element was 5.5 per cent, of the
year’s arrivals.
“Hamer”: Engineer-Commander Barry
Hocken, who supervised the building and
equipment of the mine depot at Swan Island,
off Queenscliff, and subsequently controlled
it, has finished his work and returns to Eng-
land. To turn old and useless submarines
and such junk into good mines was a labor
of love with Barry Hocken. He had 30
years’ service in the British Navy to his
credit, and was mine-engineer officer during
the war; he built the big mine depbt at
Dover in 1918. Incidentally, he remarks
that the Australian munition-workers are the
best he has encountered.
“Budge”: There is at least one hustler
in Melbourne. Just before the Fleet
procession started —that is, when people
standing eight or nine deep were breaking
their necks to get a glimpse of the roadway—•
an enterprising person came dashing to the
rescue with a lorry load of empty fruit-
cases. These he sold like hot cakes at six-
pence a time. Standing room at sixpence a
pair of feet was then offered on the broad
and spacious lorry, one or two people being
bruised in the rush. When the procession
was over and the madding crowd dispersed,
the financier calmly walked over an area of
about 20 square yards, collected every one
of his cases, and drove away—to wait, no
doubt, for the next fleet’s arrival.
To save the descent into the gorge and the
climb up the other steep face he clambered
up a standard of the aerial rope-way from
the Globe mine to Crushington (M.L.), and,
seating himself in one of the small kibbles
that transport the stone from mine to bat-
tery, set out on his journey across the great
ravine. When he was half-way over the rope
stopped; it was five o’clock. He could call,
but there was no one to hear, for he was
suspended above a lonely bush-clad gorge.
It was winter, and the cold was intense. He
was crouched up in his narrow iron seat, and
to move meant death. At 8 next morn-
ing the rope-way started a new day, and he
was released. Such was one of the many
adventures that befell the late William
Burley, miner, prospector and pioneer, who
crossed over finally at the age of 64 at the
Grey River Hospital the other day.

What makes motor car value?
8* Manufacturing economies
General MOTORS has applied the
economies of large scale production
to the building of motor cars and
trucks.
For example: In a single year the
manufacturing divisions of General
Motors, located in 38 cities, use 790,000
tons of iron and steel, 156,000,000 board
feet of lumber and 86,000,000 square feet
of upholstery. Of minor parts they use
500,000,000 lockwashers, 250,000,000
screws, and 100,000,000 pins of various
sorts.
By coordinating the purchases of its
divisions, General Motors can buy
materials of first quality at savings
which are reflected in the price you pay
for a General Motors vehicle.

Miss Nellie Bromley , a
beautiful Rexona Girl, now
appearing in “Fair and
Warmer” at the Palace
Theatre, Sydney, writes: —
“I find Rexona Soap ideal
for shampooing purposes,
and as a skin soap it is
invaluable.”
Girls! Keep your Skin
Clear, Fresh and Radiant.
Use only REXONA SOAP.
Rexona Soap is the purest of the pure and will do more to improve your slim
than you ever thought a soap could do. Being medicated on the same principle as
the famous Rexona Ointment, which is so widely used for all skin attentions, it
is able to exert the hygienic effects of Rexona upon the skin with every cleansing
operation. Rexona Soap
prevents roughness, re-
lieves clogged pores, re-
duces the tendency to
pimples, blotches, black-
heads, redness and oili-
ness, and thus gives you
a clear and beautiful com-
plexion.

It’s Medicated!

My Songs.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I SANG to her, but she was dead;
White as the burial-stone she lay.
Outside, along the darkling yews,
A bird insisted it was day;
And something yellow, like the sun.
Lay on the grass. My songs were done.
And every one was made for her
Of ruddy apples and of thyme,
Of daffodils in quivering rows, .
Of breaking dawns and harvest-time,
Of little moons between a cloud —
She needs no singing in her shroud .
I made rhythm from the sea.
A laggard wave the ebb had lost
In secret hollows of the rock
And shining shingle. It was crost
With hurrying fish, like drifts of smoke,
And swaying weed. If she awoke
She could hear echo of old tides
And silver floods in beckoning Spring,
See mackerel-boats with home-bound sail
And gannets on adventurous wing.
I knew how well she loved the sea,
But she was deaf to these and me!
I sang to her, but she was dead.
And I had made my song of flowers,
Of lilies rifled by the bees.
Of dizzy moths in starlit hours.
Of how the rose first learned to kiss—
Her cold breast had no pulse for this.
I made one lilt of wedding bells,
Of lovers in a darkened room.
A silk robe slipping from a bride —
Her white laugh mocked me from the tomb !
I sang (grown passionate in my hate
Of her pale peace) nor changed her state.
At last 1 gave a cradle song—
I wove its music by her bed—
A quiet thing of candlelight
And little hungry mouths and red.
And then, against the barren stone,
I swear I heard her move and moan !

The Clock.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
t 1" WONDER if it is much hotter in
Hell,” said Ormsby*.
He and his companion had been
silent for a whole hour. It was too hot to
talk. The little week-end shack was open
at both ends. But there was no stir in the
air. It was quite as hot outside. Once or
twice in a summer Central Australia moves
on to the coast for a day, and once in every
ten summers it grasps the coast in a grip of
fire for two days—and at longer intervals
for three.
This night followed the second day of one
of these desert visitations, and a multitude
of the people of Sydney were on the beaches,
including Jack Ormsby and Claude King,
who spent most of their summers on one
of the renowned beaches north of Sydney in
the fibro shack which Ormsby’s architectural
skill had created.
“I have built monuments more lasting than
brass and higher than the Pyramids,” he
quoted jestingly; “now' I shall build the
simplest thing necessary for the shelter of
civilised man.” Hence the shack.
It had a small living-room, a bedroom in
which there were two bunks, and a kitchen.
The sea was the bathroom. The equipment
of furniture w r as‘ simple.- The few chairs
were all easy ones, with the exception of
two office chairs, oner at each end of the
table in the living-room where the" men
worked. The arrangement was ideal for two
bachelors who loved the surf and the bush.
On a shelf in the living-room a cheap little
alarm-clock ticked loudly.
King lit his pipe. After a few puffs he
put it down.
“It’s too hot to smoke,” he said dis-
gustedly.
“That book on reincarnation that I am
reading is most interesting,” Ormsby said,
“but if there is such an arrangement as re-
incarnation it is of doubtful value. Why,
for instance, should we be enthusiastic about
coming back to w r eather like this? Not to
mention other things.”
“More particularly,” said King, “the other
things. But nobody comes back. When a
man is dead, as the niggers say, he stays
dead.”
“Perhaps! But the things we don’t know 7
seem to be rather numerous. A French abbe
now tells us that sunspots sway us out of the
normal. As the sun’s envelope, according
to solar experts, is as full of holes as a busted
goldfield, we should look for abnormal things
to happen. Perhaps,” he added reflectively,
“that’s why Simmons suicided yesterday and
ran away from a quarter of a million, mainly
in un taxable war-loan stock, and why little
Lena Bobbitt bolted the day before from
a sumptuous home, a good-citizen husband
and tw’o children.”
“Lena Bobbitt bolted ! W T here did you get
that nonsense ”
“It isn’t nonsense. I read it in to-night’s
paper. But what is more sunspotty still,
she bolted with a good-looking plumber who
was fixing the pipe in Bobbitt’s house.”
“Mad!” said King.
“Oh, as to that.” Ormsby remarked,
“whether a woman clears out with a plumber
or a prince is only a side-issue. The point
of interest is that a respectable little society
matron should be led to clear out. If sun-
spots can play these games with women and
men, and with nations —for the French abbe
says that they move to war—what becomes
of Will?”
“What Will?” King asked.
“Why, the human Will.”
“The answer to that is that if one influ-
ence is making the normal vary into the
abnormal, the wisest way to meet it is by
abandoning the normal deliberately. The
best agent for that is alcohol.” He went
to a box in a corner and took out a bottle
of whisky and a syphon.
“The ice is nearly all melted, but the grog
is cold yet. Have a spot.”
“Ormsby shook his head. “It’s too hot
for stimulants,” he said. “I’ll have a dip
in the surf.”
“You'll be clever if you do. You must
first find your surf.”
King was right. For two days there had
been no surf. The sea was as still as a
lake, except for its tidal breathing on the
sand of the beach, a motion derived from a
force far removed from the winds of earth.
On land and sea the air was stirless. The
leaves of the trees and scrub were as stiff as
if cast of bronze and iron. The flies had
been slain or driven to cover, and here and
there birds fell dead from the trees. In the
shade the thermometer measured the first day
102 degrees, the second 103. Ormsby and
King had been in the sea repeatedly during
the day and night, and now, at 3 o’clock
a.m., both w r ere in their bathing-suits.
“Another dip might bring the sleep which
knits up the ravelled sleeve of care,” Ormsby
remarked as he rose.
“I’ll try for a nap now,” said King. “The
sun will be up in an hour, and unless we
get a southerly or a north-easter we’ll do a
roast for another day. Don’t go out far,”
he added warningly, as Ormsby went to the
door. “That big blue-pointer has been cruis-
ing about the bay, and a shark in the dark
doesn’t carry a headlight. If you die. let
us have the satisfaction of giving you Chris-
tian burial.” Ormsby turned in the door-
way, the lamplight bringing out with curious
strength the lines of his handsome, charac-
terful face, framed in the black of the hour
before the dawn.
“Don’t worry,” he said with a slight smile,
“I’ll come back.” That was the last Jack
King ever saw of his friend.
King dozed for a while. When he awoke
the sun of another blazing day was over the
horizon.
Ormsby had not returned. Thinking to
find him on the beach, King strolled down
the hundred yards which lay between the
shack and the sea. On the hard sands
levelled by the receding tide Ormsby’s foot-
prints were graved beautifully clear. But
on neither sea nor beach was there any sign
of the man himself.
A strange depression seized King. On
either side of the place where Ormsby had
entered the water King walked for a quarter
of a mile, but there were no footprints on
the sand to indicate that he had emerged.
Ormsby had vanished.
King went back to the shack, in which
there was a telephone. Remote from the
roar and hurry of the great city,. the. com-
panions perforce had to be part of it in their
isolation—tied to it by that thin ware over
which the mind of man projects itself across
the distances.
He called up the police-station and re-
ported the disappearance of Ormsby and his
fear of a fatal happening. Then, still in his
bathing costume, he ran along the beach to
the southern end where a few fisherman had
their boats in a little cove breakwatered by
the long headland and reef.
Brown, one of the fishermen, had just
launched his boat for an early-morning trip
to a submerged reef where, in the dawn, if
the fisherman was in luck, an odd snapper
was to be picked up, occasionally one of those
lonely fish called “rock-natives,” which spend
their lives in frequenting rocks and reefs, and
sometimes grow to immense size.
Brown was well known to King and
Ormsby, who had frequently accompanied
him on such early-morning excursions.
When King explained the facts to the
fisherman, Brown at once volunteered to
search the sea for traces of the missing man.
Furthermore, he knocked up two of the other
fishermen, who agreed to join in the quest.
“If,” said Brown as they left the cove,
“he has been taken out by the undertow we
may find him on the water, and if we don’t
the next tide may bring him in. But if the
blue-pointer got him, that’s the last of Mr.
Ormsby.”
A search for two hours was without re-
sult. The waveless sea remained unrespon-
sive and, with a very heavy heart, King
went back to the little house, now so changed
and desolated.
The police had arrived. King answered
their questions, some of these being obvi-
ously inspired by the suspicion that he
had murdered Ormsby, and others by the
theory that Ormsby had made what one of
them spoke of as a “getaway” in order to
evade the consequences of some dark deed.
In the issue they commandeered Brown and
his boat and made their fruitless quest on
the sea.
King waited with anxiety for the rising
tide to reach the flood, but it brought to the
beach no dreaded solution of the mystery.
Ormsby’s fate was seemingly one of the sea’s
guarded secrets.
When he w r as packing his bag to return to
Sydney he thought of Ormsby’s last words
as he stood in the doorway only that morn-
ing, “I’ll come back.” Inevitably followed
the overwhelming reflection of the limitations
of our knowledge of what a day may bring
forth.
As he took a last look at the room, once so
companionable, now so desecrated by Fate,
he noticed that the little alarm-clock was
ticking away stoutly, although it should have
been silent. At breakfast-time Ormsby
always wound it. This was something he
never omitted, his special duty. King looked
at the boldly-figured dial.
“Jack will never wind you again,” he
thought as he closed and locked the door.
The wind was sighing, and in the south
quadrant of the sky a range of black moun-
tains was rising fast. The hot spell was
broken.
A week later King revisited the week-end
cottage on the beach with Ormsby’s lawyer,
Booth, who was friend as well as legal
adviser to both. Some papers of the missing
man -were required for the settlement of his
affairs, and these were at the shack.
When King and Booth entered the living-
room both men noticed a strong odor of sea-
weed. Booth remarked on it. King made
no reply; his eyes were fixed on the clock.
“One moment,” he said presently. Going
to a box on a shelf he produced a microscope,
and while Booth looked on in bewilderment
he closely inspected the doorsteps and the
sills of the windows. Then he turned to
Booth.
“Do you remember that I told you of
Jack’s last words, ‘l’ll come back’?”
“Yes.”
“Well, .Tack has come back.”
Booth surveyed him keenly.

“Don’t talk rubbish,” he said. “Surely you
don’t deduce anything so preposterous from
a smell of seaweed.”
(( “Well, that wants explaining,” said King,
“and a good explanation. But there’s some-
thing else. That clock is going, isn’t it?”
“Yes,” said Booth, “it is.”
“But it should not be going,” continued
King. “It has to be wound once a day.”
“Well, somebody must do it.”
“I am no more superstitious than you are,
and 1 am just as keen about the value of
evidence, although I don’t happen to be a

is why I took the microscope, although I was
beforehand practically certain that nobody
alive had entered this room since I locked its
door a week ago. The microscope confirmed
this view. The dust on the doorstep was un-
disturbed by any steps but ours. The win-
dows have not been opened.” In the silence
which followed, the clock ticked strongly,
with a suggestion of insistence. The odor of
seaweed seemed heavier. From outside came
the sound of great waves thundering on the
beach.
“Somebody must do it,” repeated Booth.
“Who winds the clock?”
King, white-faced, looked at his com-

The Soft Answer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
mWO days before the end of March, in
the Year of Our Lord 1809, a good
deal of unpleasantness blew into the
River Derwent in Van Diemen’s Land, and
found an anchorage opposite the little village
of Hobart Town, nestling in primitive and
picturesque simplicity at the foot of the
Table Mountain. The namesake of that
noble basaltic mound was still Lieut.-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley, just then busily pre-
paring the discomfiture of Marshal Soult
in Portugal—and many tides were to ebb
and flow in the river at its base before it
should receive the name of the victor of
Waterloo.
The particular form of disagreeableness
that came to afflict this farthest-flung out-
post of the British Empire was very
adequately personified in his Excellency Com-
modore William Bligh, R.N., who flew his
broad pennant at the masthead of H.M.S.
Porpoise, and paced the deck of his only home
in Australia in a condition of peevish irasci-
bility, when not engaged in penning wrath-
ful and vindictive despatches in the cabin
to Viscount Castlereagh, Secretary of State
for the Colonies. The capacity for wrath,
irascibility and vindictiveness enjoyed by his
Excellency—just now a pro-consul lacking
a province—was world-famous by this time,
having spread to all parts where the Union
Jack was wont to display itself during the
twenty years that had elapsed since his
irregular gifts in this direction had led to
the mutiny in 11.M.5. Bounty. It was, there-
fore with no cheerful anticipation of easy
times to come that his Honor Licutenant-
Governor David Collins awoke one morn-
ing- to a realisation of the fact that the
future of his administration was inevitably
to be clouded with troubles that were not
of his own seeking, when he recognised who
his visitor was.
“Demme,” he remarked to the Rev. R-obert
Knopwood, Chaplain to the Settlement, as
they watched the King's ship from the gar-
den of Government House, “there’s going to
be trouble for us, I fear, Mr. Knopwood.
Much trouble. A stormy petrel, if ever there
was one. What the devil’s he waut here:
Lord help us all!”
“By gad, sir,” responded the Reverend
Robert. “I think ye’re well right!
We’re going to have a hell of a time of it —
a hell of a time of it!”
Mr. Knopwood was no meek and gentle
apostle of Christianity. His language, even
in the pulpit, was almost of the quality of
the lower deck of a man-o’-war, liis capacity
for rum was prodigious, his appearance for-
midable, and his ideas as to the functioning
of his sacred office original in the extreme.
He was a stout, bull-necked, red-faced man,
possessed of an activity and energy that
his appearance belied, and in force of char-
acter was easily more than a match for the
good-natured, easy-going, kindly Collins. Ii
might almost be hinted that the sporting
parson was rather more of Lieutenant-Gov-
ernor of Van Diemen’s Land, in ISO 9, than
the Lieutenant-Governor was himself.
One of the letters with which the dis-
possessed autocrat Bligh inundated Castle-
reagli, dated “H.M.S. Porpoise, in the Der-
went, New South Wales, 10th June, 1809”
it has 83 paragraphs—contains a brief de-
scription of Hobart Town at this time, and
is worth quoting:
Mr. Collins Is also called “Superintendent of
Public Works” ; but except Government House,
which is a miserable specimen of his art, there
is nothing done but a shell of a building called an
Orphan School, alternately used as a shelter of
cattle and men; a blacksmith’s shop; a deplorable
house in the lumber-yard, under the shed of which
Divine service is performed; a new brick Store
begun, but the walls only raised about ten feet, and
remaining in that state; and an old storehouse,
built with plank and thatched since the beginning
of the settlement, that does not contain half the
Government provisions, the other part lying- con-
stantly exposed to the weather. The other build-
ings of the town are merely huts with two or
three rooms; of such habitations there are about
two hundred.
Since the place, however, was but six
years old, and had suffered from many pri-
vations during its earliest years—notably
from famine —Hobart Town was really rather
more of a credit to its founders than the
spitefulness of Captain Bligh permitted him
to convey to his Lordship.
Mr. Knopwood, being constitutionally
something of a Tory, and disliking anything
that savored of revolution or political change,
was at first somewhat disposed to champion
the cause of the ejected Governor. After
all, he was the King’s representative. The
doings of Mr. John Macarthur and the offi-
cers of the New South Wales Corps up in
Sydney bore a suspicious resemblance to
mutiny and high treason. It Was necessary
for such as were loyal to the Throne and
person, the Established Church and the
British Constitution to emulate Agag, and
tread delicately before the Lord in such
troublous times. He would, therefore, con-
fer privately with his Excellency, and
attempt to find out whether, between them,
the two strong men on the spot—he did not
take Colonel Collins into account —could not
arrive at something of a live-and-let-live un-
derstanding. It was merely a matter of time
before the Home Government brought Syd-
ney to its bearings, when rebellion and dis-
affection would be suitably rewarded in a
manner unpleasant to such as had been dis-
affected and rebellious. Wherefore it was
necessary for an official and a magistrate
to be on the side of Governor Bligh. But
the settlement, and each individual in it,
was dependent for its very existence upon
the caprice of the rebel government at head-
quarters. Wherefore, also, it was very neces-
sary to be inoffensive to. that powerful, if
merely temporary, Administration.
It was a beautiful morning when Mr.
Ivnopwood, having borrowed the Lieutenant-
Governor's gig for the occasion, had himself
rowed out to the flagship. The great moun-
tain, towering up against the clear blueness
of the sky, seemed to sleep in the warm sun-
shine, and the village at its feet, strangely
like some venerable English hamlet, as
viewed from the river, had a peaceful, happy
100k —with its spirals of blue smoke curling
up against the purple-green background of
forest-clad ranges behind —that was singu-
larly deceptive as to its real state of feeling
in this crisis of its early history.
As his boat approached the warship, the
chaplain became aware of Captain Bligli
pacing the poop, his hands under his coat-
tails and his three-cornered hat fitted to-
wards the back of his head. Mr. Knopwood
genially waved a fat hand in salutation.
Good fellowship was to be the keynote of
this conference. Bluff ness and heartiness.
The rough seadog to be warmed into friend-
liness by a jovial reasonableness that could
not fail of its purpose. No doubt a bowl
of rum punch in the cabin. All would be well.
His Excellency paused in his promenade,
and stared over the rail at the approaching
boat. Then suddenly he bellowed angrily.
“Officer of the watch, d —n your eyes,
who’s this fat alongside? Why doesn’t
the sentry challenge? Demme, I’ll give the
fellow two dozen at seven bells!”
The scared marine, pacing his beat be-
tween the mizzen mast and the break of the
poop, brought his firelock to the “put” and
waveringly hailed the boat.
“Boat ahoy, what’s your bus’ness?”
The officer of the watch, muttering male-
diction, hurried to the gangway.
“What d’ye want?” lie cried. “Sheer off
till ye get permission to come aboard, else
ye’ll be fired on.”
With great difficulty the chaplain con-
trolled his righteous indignation, and stood
up in the sternsheets, removing his hat. The
freshly-powdered whiteness of his best bob-
wig gleamed in the sunlight.
“I am the Reverend Robert Knopwood.”
he bellowed back, “come to pay my respects
to his Excellency, as is my duty.”
Bligh glared at his stout figure in a hos-
tile fashion. But in those days there were
not so _ many Government officials who
deemed it necessary to make a point of pay-
nig him respects. So he was a little molli-
fied, and called down to the boat in as plea-
sant a fashion as he could improvise: “All
right, d —n ye, come aboard.”
He bent his steps towards the poop-ladder
and descended to the quarter-deck to receive
his visitor. But the glare was not gone from
his eyes. He could never forget the un-
speakable wrongs he had been enduring these
many months past. Even an angel’s visit
would have found him resentful and irritated.
Mr. Knopwood, having barked his shin
as he ascended with difficulty a narrow rope-
ladder with wooden rungs that was but ill-
adapted to his bulk, stepped over the comb-
ing puffing and blowing, and, very reprehen-
sibly, no doubt, omitted to salute the sacred
quarter-deck, being immediately and terri
finally reminded of liis remissness.
“Sink you in Hell, sir, why don’t ye take
off your hat?” roared Captain Bligli. “Have
ye no manners?”
The chaplain stared at the Governor in
astonishment. Him, the senior magistrate
at the Derwent, a clergyman, a gentleman,
to be addressed in such a fashion! Horrible
- -intolerable! Ilis red face deepened in
color to a purple tinge. His broad chest
swelled with indignation. The short hairs
of his cropped scalp seemed to tingle beneath
his wig. He was grievously outraged. He could
hardly believe the reality of such a situation.
“What the devil do you want?” barked
Captain Bligh in his pleasantest manner.
“Haven’t ye a tongue in your head, sir?”
And then Bobby Knopwood found his
tongue. “H—l and damnation!” he roared
at the Governor. “May I perish infernally!
Why, me till I'm well , ye
bargee, what d’ye mean by well
addressing me in such a fashion? For two
ping I’d take my cane to yfe, ye!
You son of a fiddler’s ! You
rascal! You krw ——! Good morning, sir
—d n your eyes!”
*** * *
“Your Honor,” said the chaplain to the
Lieutenant-Governor, as they sat over their
wine after dinner later in the day, “the fel-
low’s impossible. I can quite well under-
stand why they turned him out of his Gov-
ernment at Sydney. ’Tis not to be thought
we should recognise his authority here. It
may be ’tis a most serious thing to turn
against his Majesty’s representative. But
we must choose. And ’tis my counsel to
ye to choose the lesser evil. The lesser evil,
sir. The consequences may be serious, I’ll
admit. But I also put it to you, ’twill be
better to chance them than to submit to
this—this ill-bred . Why, sir, his lan-
guage to me this morning was atrocious.
Monstrous ! Outrageous ! Not to be tolerated.
’Twas all I could do, sir, to remember the
dignity of my sacred office, and comport my-
self as a lowly follower of our Redeemer.”
Colonel Collins smiled faintly as he helped
himself to another glass of port.
“And What did you do. my dear Chaplain?
He actually cursed you on his own quarter-
deck! Dear me—unbelievable! Pray, what
did you do?”
“All that was left open to me, sir. I
rebuked him gently and left the ship. The
soft answer, sir—-’tis ever commendable.”

You should use them too.
