FAMOUS LEGENDS CENTRE AROUND GLASTONBURY'S ANCIENT ABBEY
LASTONBURY ABBEY, situated some five miles from Wells, in Somer-
VF set. is the oldest religious foundation in the British Isles, and is the
setting for the legends Of St. Joseph of Arimathea and of King Arthur and
his Knights of the Round Table.
Legend asserts that Joseph of Arimathea and his eleven companions -
arrived in Britain by way of the Severn and landed at Glastonbury, which was
then an island. There they hid the “Holy Grail” (the cup of blessing from
the Last Supper), and from its sepulchre at the foot of Glastonbury lor there
gushed forth a spring which still exists today and is mentioned by Tennyson
in his “Idylls of the King.” It is recorded that on nearby Wearyall Hill
Joseph’s staff took root and became the miraculous thorn tree which ever
afterwards blossomed annually on Christmas Day. The original thorn was
cut down in the seventeenth century by a zealous Puritan, who accidentally
cut off his own leg in the process. A graft from the root of the original tree
was planted later in the Abbey grounds, and is seen in the foreground of the
accompanying illustration.
Joseph and his missionaries built a shrine which was found many gepem-
ations later, and which was visited by St, Patrick in the early part of the
fifth century. In 633 it is recorded that this original church was strengthened
by wood and lead to preserve it from further deterioration. Larger churches
were raised on the site by Ine, King of the West Saxons, 10 J St.
Dunstan early in the tenth century and by Norman abbots after the Conquest.
The Abbey grew in size, wealth and influence, but a disastrous fire in 110
destroyed most of the Abbey, which was rebuilt on a Jjj®
surviving ruins date from periods varying from 1184 to the fifteenth century.
Excavations, however, have revealed the foundations of the church built by
Kins Ine in the eighth century. On this sacred spot were buned three Saxon
and the remains of King Arthur and Guinevere were reputed to have
been discovered there in 1191. . c .
The last Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey was Richard Whytmg, who refused
to surrender the Abbey to Henry VIII at the time of the Dissolution of the
Monasteries, and paid for his refusal with his life.

A LAWSON BIBLIOGRAPHY.
Dr.., George Mackaness’s beautifully
bound and printed An Annotated
Bibliography of Henry Lawson (Angus
and Robertson) is a striking proof of
how quickly Lawson has become an Aus-
tralian classic and an equally striking
contrast to Lawson’s own first book,
Short Stories in Prose and Verse (1894),
of which The Bulletin said at the
time:
It is a poor little, badly-printed volume,,
and contains only a dozen or so examples
of the writer’s skill in verse and prose (and
those not all of his best); but every Aus-
tralian should invest a shilling in a copy—
firstly, because the book is well worth if;
secondly, because the book is a characteristi-
cally Australian book, one of the few
original attempts towards an Australian
literature; and thirdly, because the author
will be thereby encouraged to produce a
bigger volume in better form —a form more
worthy of his genius. For Henry Lawson
has a real stroke of genius—perhaps, as
poet and story-teller united, a more' luminous
streak than any other man in Australasia.
Short Stories in Prose and Verse was
published by Louisa Lawson, the poet’s
energetic mother, at her printery at 402
George-street, Sydney, and, so the story
goes, was set up in type and machined by
women printers. In his preface to the
book Lawson said that the contents had
been “collected and printed hurriedly,
with an eye to Christmas, and without
experienced editorial assistance, which
last, I begin to think, was sadly neces-
sary.” According to Mary Gilmore many
of the original edition of 500 copies were
accidentally destroyed when a number
of the sheets were blown off a cart
on to the wet street while the author was
taking them to the bindery. That
accident and the fact that Lawson with-
drew the book from sale soon after its
publication, says Dr. Mackaness, explains
the extreme rarity of the volume today.
A. G. Stephens has stated, however, that
Louisa Lawson told him that the edition
was 1000 copies. She gave Henry 500,
which he sold, and when he came to her
for more she gave him what she had
left. She attached no importance to the
matter of the sheets blown from the cart.
A great improvement on Louisa
Lawson’s poorly produced volume (96
uncut pages printed with poor ink on
inferior paper, illustrated with crude
woodblocks and bound in a light-green
paper cover) was the first edition of In
The Days When the World Was Wide
and Other Verses, published in 1896 by
Angus and Robertson, printed on Dutch
hand-made paper and bound (generally)
in dark maroon buckram, with top edge
gilt, and the title repeated, sometimes in
gold, on the spine, or the even more
handsome large-paper limited edition
with its photogravure portrait and auto-
graph of the author. The ordinary
edition sold for five shillings and the
limited edition for a guinea. Both are
worth several pounds today.
The book was reviewed in The
Bulletin by J. F. Archibald, to whom it
was dedicated, who said:
Lawson’s shortcomings are obvious
enough. His mental scope is narrow; he is
comparatively uncultured; he iterates the
same note, and rarely improves his thought
by elaboration; he wants harmony and
variety of metre; his work is burdened with
many weak lines and careless tags. But how
graphic he is, how natural, how true, how
strong! How he feels, and makes his
readers feel, in poems like “Out Back,”
when phrase by phrase is painted an im-
perishable bush picture. Lawson’s short-
comings are obvious; but, for Australians,
they are as nothing besides his merits. And
it must be remembered that his verse repre-
sents only half of his work, and perhaps not
the finer half. His prose, brimming with
humor and pathos, is of the best produced
in Australia.
While very few copies of Short Stories
in Prose and Verse have survived, first
editions of In the Days When the World
Was Wide appear in the second-hand
bookshops every now and then and are
eagerly bought by Lawson collectors.
Recently this writer picked up a copy
from an unsuspecting Brisbane book-
seller for a few shillings and sold it to a
Sydney collector for three guineas.
There is at present a vogue for
Lawsoniana, and I have seen a Lawson
1.0. U. (the amount was for 6d.) change
or a P oun d and a Lawson letter
sold for a tenner. Recently Sydney book-
seller Jim Tyrrell paid 31 guineas at an
auction sale for the MS. of a Lawson
poem Old North Sydney,” published in
The North Shore and Manly Times.”
There are pitfalls, however, in the
collection of Lawson items, and the new-
comer to the game, as well as the ex-
perienced collector, would be well ad-
vised to avail himself of a copy of Dr.
George Mackaness’s bibliography. This
scholarly work is the first attempt to re-
cord in standard bibliographical style
Lawson’s collected literary output, and
is, it is to be hoped, the forerunner of
other complete bibliographies devoted to
major Australian writers. The book is a
large and extremely handsome produc-
tion, illustrated with ten full-page plates.
John Gartner, of the Hawthorn Press,
Melbourne, designed and printed it for
Angus and Robertson.
A solitary blemish is the selection for
the frontispiece of David Low’s colored
caricature of the poet from the private
collection of Jim Tyrrell. The Low draw-
ing is brilliant, but it obviously shows
Lawson on the spree; and the dignified
Longstaff portrait, reproduced elsewhere
in the book, painted in six hours when
Lawson was passing through Melbourne
on his way to England in 1900, would
surely have been a more suitable frontis-
piece for a volume that celebrates his
genius.
Dr. Mackaness has described in biblio-
graphical detail 44 first editions and as
many reprints of first editions as he has
been able to locate. It could not have
been an easy mission. As far back as
1925, when Percival Serle published his
useful Bibliography of Australasian
Poetry and Verse, David McKee Wright
said that anyone who contemplated a
complete Lawson bibliography should be
warned that an exacting task, calling for
infinite patience and zeal, was ahead of
them. The snags that confronted Dr.
Mackaness reveal themselves as early as
his description of the first edition of In
the Days When the World Was Wide.
That edition is generally thought to have
been bound only in dark maroon buck-
ram, but Dr. Mackaness was to discover
in the possession of Mr. H. F. Chaplin, a
keen Lawson collector and president of
the Book Collectors’ Society of Australia,
three copies of the first edition, all exactly
similar in pagination, advertisements, etc.,
but with three differences in binding:
(a) maroon buckram as described, (b)
dark brown binding stamped in gilt on
spine, and (c) light brown binding
stamped in black on spine.
Variations occur in respect of binding
and other details in other first editions
and important reprints, and although
Dr. Mackaness has been able to track
down many of these it is possible that
others are still in hiding. All this fuss
and bother about variations is very
baffling to the mere layman, but there
are book-collectors who delight in such
differences and who regard their collec-
tions as incomplete unless they possess
every known variation.
Another bewildering feature of some
Lawson titles is their tortuous and com-
plex careers, A book, for instance, will
be divided into two parts with, perhaps,
added material; made one again with a
title different from the original and with
additional or substituted contents ; and
split up again with rearranged contents.
All this is one large headache for even the
most patient bibliographer and very con-
fusing to all except the experienced col-
lector.
An idea of what Dr. Mackaness was
faced with might be gleaned from the
history of While the Billy Boils (1896).
There were at least a dozen reprints of
the original edition, some differing from
others. Thereafter it was to appear in the
Uniform Edition, The Billy Boils Edition,
The Commonwealth Series, The E. W.
Cole’s Edition, The English Edition, The
Snowy River Edition, The Cheap Edition,
The Platypus Edition, and Cape’s
“Travellers’ Library” Edition, presenting
several snags for the unwary even in its
comparatively straightforward career.
Among the titles described by Dr.
Mackaness are several familiar to col-
lectors of Lawsoniana, but more or less
unknown to the average Lawson reader.
The best of these, The Auld Shop and
The New (1923), “written especially for
The Chief,’ George Robertson of Angus
and Robertson, as some slight acknow-
ledgment of and small return for his
splendid generosity during years of
trouble,” is one of the most difficult to
procure. Printed for private circulation
in a limited edition of 75 copies, they were
presented by George Robertson to his
relatives, his immediate friends and the
members of his staff. Not more than
half-a-dozen copies at most have ever
come into the market.
In his notes on the text of The Auld
Shop and The New George Robertson
throws an interesting sidelight on the
business relationship between Lawson
and his publisher at the time of the
publication of In the Days When
the World Was Wide. The agreement
with Lawson provided for an
equal division of profit between author
and publisher, but three months later
Lawson commuted his interest in the
volume, then in the press, for £54, of
which £l4 had already been advanced to
him. Afterwards, when Paterson’s The
Man from Snowy River, published under
a similar agreement, had proved such a
success, Angus and Robertson wrote
voluntarily to Lawson saying that they
would cancel the straightout sale and
consider the £54 an advance of half-
profits. “But,” said Robertson;
In a short time we were forced to buy
him out again: he thought that a profit-
sharing agreement entitled him to half-a-
crown, five shillings, or five pounds when-
ever he wanted them —which very often was
several times in the course of one day.
Three years later Lawson confessed in
a Bulletin “Red Page” article that he
had sold the .entire rights of In the Days
When the World Was Wide and While
the Billy Boils and that they had netted
him something over £2OO. His whole
literary earnings during a period of 12
years he estimated at £7OO. His advice
to young authors was either to get out of
Australia before “genius turned to gall”
or to shoot themselves. Advice which
several young writers —-E. J. Brady,
Henry Fletcher, Harry Stock dale,
Bernard Espinasse and Alex Montgomery
—repudiated in a following issue of The
Bulletin.
Throughout his writing life Henry
Lawson was beset with money difficulties
—difficulties of his own making and not
due to any lack of generosity on the part
of his editors and publishers. Certainly in
George Robertson and in three Bulletin
editors, J. F. Archibald, James Edmond
and S. H. Prior, he had understanding
and staunch friends. As was Jim Tyrrell,
who published Lawson’s My Army, O,
My Army and Other Songs in 1915.
Lawson’s chronic need for ready
money resulted in some queer publica-
tions that did his reputation little good,
but which change hands today at fancy
prices. One of these was A Coronation
Ode and Retrospect (1911), a narrow
half-folio booklet of eight pages, pub-
lished by Coffill and Co., a firm of
Sydney undertakers, at the time of the
coronation of King George V. Funds
were also undoubtedly low when, in 1916,
Lawson wrote for the proprietors of
“Heenzo,” a patent cough medicine, a
poem entitled “The Tragedy,” which was
used as an advertisement in The
Bulletin and other papers. In the poem
he accuses an unnamed mate of stealing
a bottle of “Heenzo” from his desk,
which brought forth some verses en-
titled “A Repudiation,” from the pen of
Lawsons friend, J. W. Gordon (“Jim
Grahame”), and caused Mrs. Stan
Roberts to write “A Confession” and
Farley ( ohen (Dr. Mackaness has
Harley Matt hews) “Another Confession” ;
to which Lawson replied with two ad-
ditional poems both signed “ ’Any.”
Iwenty-eight years later, in response to
many requests from all over Australia,
the “Heenzo” people repeated the ad-
vertisement in the issue of The Bulletin
for July 5, 1944.
Some interesting facts emerge from
Dr. Mackaness’s annotations. One
learns that “The Glass on the Bar” was
Archibald’s favorite piece; that “The
Vagabond and “The Sliprails and the
Spur” were George Robertson’s
favorites: and that a boyhood sweet-
heart, Bertha Lambert, was “The
Drover’s Sweetheart” and “The Free
Selector’s Daughter.” The “Old Mate”
referred to in the preliminary verses, “To
an Old Mate,” in In the Days When the
World Was Wide was John Le Gay
Brereton. A novel by Henry Lawson,
The Hero of Rede lay, was announced,
but was never published. A short-story,
bearing the same title, however, was pub-
lished in On the Track and Over the Slip-
rails (1910).
Another book which was never pub-
lished was a volume of stories called Ah
Soon , The manuscript is now in the
Mitchell Library, Sydney, as is also the
poet’s own uncompleted autobiography,
a condensation of which was made by
Bertram Stevens in “The Lone Hand”
for March, 1908. Lawson’s first prose
contribution to The Bulletin, “His
Father’s Mate”—-it was printed in the
1888 Christmas number, greatly to the
pride of his father —appeared in France
under the title “Gamarade de Son Pere” ;
while another of his stories, “The Loaded
Dog,” saw print in the same country as
“Le Chien Explosif.” Henry would have
chuckled oyer that title.
There is also “A tabulated list of the
Collected Poems and Stories of Henry
Lawson,” “Henry Lawson’s Prefaces” —
he wrote, among others, prefaces to
Miles Franklin’s My Brilliant Career and
C, J. Dennis’s Songs of a Sentimental
Bloke (1913)- —a checklist of Lawson’s
writings for the Brisbane “Boomerang,”
compiled by Walter Stone, editor of
“Biblionews,” and a list of books and
articles about Henry Lawson.
The illustrations include facsimiles of
the title-pages of four of Lawson’s books
and of a page of his manuscript, the
Longstaff . pertrait, the Low caricature,
four photographs of the poet in his late
thirties, a portrait by Frank Mahony, and
a sketch of the cottage at Abbotsford
(N-S.W.) where Lawson died in 1922,
drawn by J. B. Godson.

THE WATERHOLE.
What my ma calls dirt is a turkey-egg spot.
But I hide my boots in the vacant lot
And drop my h’s for a lighter load,
And we stalk like cripples down the blue stone road.
There’s an old dope living in a field of fowls;
We shout “Good morrun ” when he turns and scowls
With a face that’s wattled like a bleeding nose.
For he s got his suspicions where the poultry goes.
It’s noon till six at the waterhole
Where the yabbies are colored like a cloudy pearl.
And we bcfil them gold in a rusty tin,
Screwing up our eyes as we drop them in.
Then the cock cries warning, the world is still,
And the day dies burning in the crayfish pool;
But we’ll stone our terrors on the old street sign—-
There'll be men in the world when we’re fifteen.

Jack Sorensen .
Jack Sorensen, a man who wrote much
verse for The Bulletin and for many
less discriminating publications, did not
find the words to please all his critics —
but he found those to please his friends,
and therefore there was published, only
a year after his suicide in 1949, a volume
of his Collected Poems (Service Printing
Go., Hay-street, Perth, W.A.). The col-
lecting was done by writer Mary Durack,
to whom, she reports, he once said,
“Nothing else about me is of any conse-
quence. For what they are worth these
scribblings are the best of me. Could
you find a corner for them somewhere?”
In her foreword to the little volume
Miss Durack, who in private life is
Mrs. Horne Miller, writes of Jack with
warmth and understanding, on a level of
personal as much as poetic appreciation,
which was almost certainly what he
wanted from all the people he met and
liked. As she points out, he was a
balladist who preferred to speak his
verse, more in love with its sound than
with its shape—he belonged, perhaps, to
an age before there was any writing,
when there were just thoughts, and the
one way of expressing them.
When Jack graduated to The Bulletin
from the kind of bush newspapers that
reward contributors with free subscrip-
tions he was very pleased. The cheques
with Mr. Micawber on them reassured
him that he was performing the job he
had chosen quite efficiently. But his eyes
never gleamed as warmly over money or
evidence of public appreciation as they
did when a friend laughed or was
thoughtfully silent- The best of his ideas
and dreams were too delicate to get on
to paper, though, of course, he always
intended to write them down eventually.
When he did get them down, as in
“Fitzroy Campsite,” they had the
authentic Australian flavor of the bush

"LABOR'S" DILEMMA.
With Mr. Chifley’s death the “Labor”
ship has lost its captain in a gale which
was already arousing in the crew an
urgent desire to seek a port where some
reprovisioning in policy could be found.
The late captain’s last and rather despair-
ing address to his men at the Sydney
A.L.P. conference exposed the reigning
confusion of counsel, and this confusion
is now blowing like a mighty wind about
their ears with considerable force.
During the futile 1950 Parliament,
rendered futile by obstruction in the
Senate of measures which the Socialists
had vainly opposed at the 1949 elections,
nothing was more obvious than the
impotence of their Opposition to present
any constructive policy in place of the
Government’s programme. Under Mr;
Chifley’s leadership they showed but one
motive. They refused to accept the
verdict of the electors —indeed, the
blockade which they operated from the
Senate was designed for just that purpose
before they went out of office. The
socialisation policy to which they were
committed had been rejected emphatically
by the electorate; and, although an
increasing section in the caucus realised
that that policy was dead and damned
as an election-winner, the governing
influences in “the movement” clung to it
for the simple reason that they had no
other.
This attitude was clearly shown by the
late leader only a few days before his
death when, on this subject of the
Socialist revolution, he told the Sydney
A.L.P. conference —“If from time to
time our policy is not favored by the
majority, that is no reason to set it
aside The movement has to make
up its mind what is the right thing to
do.” For himself —and what he said
would have to go for the party —he
poured scorn on the idea of striking a
course “down the middle of the road.”
He said he felt ashamed that there had
been so much shifting of ground within
the party. Yet when the Curtin-Evatt
combination campaigned for office in
1941 the whole emphasis was put on
“Labor’s” appeal as a middle-of-the-road
party, and it was that appeal which won.
The April elections confirmed the
Liberals’ 1949 mandate and could be
interpreted, on any mature consideration
by the defeated “Labor” obstructionists,
only as a warning from the electors to
alter course. Above all this was true of
the red-hot issue of Communist sabotage
in industry and in the unions, which had
been fed prodigiously by the attempt
under the previous Chifley Government
to establish “Labor’s” Red objective.
Eveii after those decisive elections of last
April, “Labor” was exhorted by its late
leader to ignore the verdict of the people,
and to fight inside and outside Parlia-
ment against the measures to stamp-out
the Communist-run political strikes for
which the Menzies Government had the
clearest mandate, doubly-confirmed.
This exhortation was delivered,
astonishingly enough, in direct reference
to an industrial crisis caused by a Com-
munist “black” ban on shipping in Aus-
tralian ports as a means of bolstering-up
an already defeated blockade of New
Zealand under political strikes called by
Communist union executives there. The
New Zealand strike had been denounced
by the N.Z. Federation of Labor, and the
Communist ban here by the Australian
Council of Trade Unions. Mr. Chifley’s
direction to his party was to ignore these
instructions from the supreme trade-
union authority in each Dominion. The
Menzies Government’s move to deregister
the rebellious Waterside Workers’
Federation in Australia was described by
Mr. Chifley as calculated to “renew the
legacy of bitterness and hatred left by
the 1917 strike.” Following hard upon
those unhappy words of his, the Com-
munist wharfies’ executives were rushing
to cover and calling off the ban on the
mere threat of deregistration.
How far removed from reality “Labor”
leadership in Australia has been is shown
by the warning to Australian unionists
and other citizens uttered last month by
the president of the N.Z. Federation of
Labor, who is also national president of
the N.Z. Seamen’s Union:
The genesis of this dispute was the de-
cision of the N.Z. Waterside Workers’
Union to join up with the Cominform-
directed World Federation of Trade
Unions. The men who proclaimed this
policy precipitated this strike without con-
sulting the Federation of Labor. They are
not interested in obtaining wage-benefits
and improved conditions. All they want
is a civil upheaval which can be used by
the Communists to overthrow our demo-
cratic system of government and bring in
a Communist dictatorship.
It is a political, not an industrial, strike.
If anybody in Australia doubts that, he
can examine a letter I have received from
the national president of the W.W.U., H.
Barnes, In reply to my invitation to meet
other union leaders for exploration of a
settlement.
In the course of this letter, rejecting my
offer for a conference, Barnes speaks of the
“common fight against the Holland Govern-
ment,” the “fight against Fascism,” the
“Fascist menace confronting N.Z.,” and
“our determination to resist all attacks of
the Tory Government and its Fascist
allies.” All these phrases, so typical of the
propaganda churned out from Moscow,
show the political character of the
strike....
These leaders are the real scabs. They
scabbed when they walked out of the
Federation of Labor. When they have
caused enough suffering and split the
trade-nnion movement wide open, they’ll
send a triumphant report of their suc-
cesses to Uncle Joe and then beat a re-
treat through the back door. They have
done this before and they will do it again.
The tie-up of ships for Britain is a top-
priority directive issued to port unions
throughout the world by the W.F.T.U.
Our waterside leaders take their orders
from it the same as they do in Aus-
tralia.
Mr. Chifley, at the Sydney A.L.P. con-
ference, declared that the Government’s
proposed amendment of the Arbitration
Act to require secret ballots for union
elections was a sign of the Government’s
“hatred of all unions,” and he added that
“secret ballots are a farce.” Yet two
days later he asserted at the Common-
wealth Jubilee dinner his conviction that
the whole liberty of a people depends
essentially on, he insisted, one supreme
privilege—the “sacred right” to the
secret ballot for the election of their
democratic Parliament.
It is conceded by all observers that
the keynote of Mr. Chifley’s leadership
was his domination of his party caucus,
as distinct from the A.L.P. conference.
That is ope of the necessities of Parlia-
mentary leadership in modern times. It
was intimately a necessity in the “Labor”
party, whose ranks have been acutely
divided on the vital issues of the day.
Mr. Chifley on several occasions made
plain enough that he would not stand
for any watering-down of the revolu-
tionary Socialist policy on which his
party has been sundered ever since the
failure of his attempt to implement that
policy while in office. With his hand
removed that question now poses itself
with greater insistence than ever. So
long as the Red objective remains at
the head of the “Labor” platform, so
long will “the movement,” industrial and
political wings alike, be at the mercy of
those wreckers whom the party’s late
leader, during his own struggle against
them while Prime Minister, described as
traitors and agents of a foreign Power.
A Real Jubilee.
The pageantry of Canberra at its Parlia-
mentary Jubilee celebration seemed to
make little impression on the people of
Australia. A few years ago such an event
would have been truly national. Today
it is significant that Parliament has only
a secondary and rather cynical interest.
Most daily papers were so little con-
cerned with the election of a new presi-
dent of the Senate —a distinguished soldier
at that —that save for some snapshots
printed to illustrate incidents they did not
print his photograph. The events of
Jubilee-day were only scrappily reported,
and were subsidiary to the news that the
Speaker (with the concurrence of the
Prime Minister) had had the effrontery
to close the Parliamentary bars in order
to assure that the work of the Parlia-
mentary staff should be uninterrupted.
The truth is that Parliamentary
standards have fallen sadly both as to
oratory, administrative ability and self-
respect since the days when Deakin and
Barton were part of it. It is recognised
for what it is—a body of delegates tied
to highly-organised political parties in
which there is little room for displays of
individuality, much less greatness.
It was a sensation when it was dis-
covered that a Liberal- or Country-party
member had apparently voted against a
party nominee for the Speakership—a
shocking political felony which, of
course, would have completely disgraced
and destroyed the culprit had he been a
“Labor” man. On the other hand, there
was no surprise that the “Labor” party
should choose the day of jubilee, when
Parliament should have advertised itself
to a host of distinguished visitors at its
best, seeing especially thal its own birth
was being celebrated, to stage an empty
and snarling demonstration against Mr.
Cameron on the ground of his supposed
partiality. “Labor” in this pro-
vided evidence of its own insincerity
by nominating Mr. Rosevear, who,
during his term of office, acted as the
official representative of the A.L.P. in
the Federal caucus, frequently took the
floor in violent partisan manner in de-
bates, went into Sydney Domain to
attack judges of the High Court, and in
general treated the Speakership as if it
were a party convenience.
Parliament and its outlook is certainly
nothing to be wildly proud of or to
excite enthusiasm. There is general
disgust with its standard of debate and
its standard of manners —though, of
course, there are still many members
whose manners and standards are high.
Unlike the House of Commons, its
powers are proved again and again to
be limited in some vital matters such as
the control of subversive elements. And
its trends are not of a kind which either
enhance the popularity of legislatures or
raise their prestige.
The continual competition of parties
to outbid each other for the favor of
majorities has gone so far that it has
become almost impossible for any party
which is not willing to stoop to some
form of electoral bribery to gain or
retain office, and this has been taken for
granted since the Bruce Government
went out, largely on the pathetic
cry of “Labor,” aided and abetted uni-
versally by the cinema interests, that it
was “taxing the kiddies’ pictures” through
its new and negligible entertainment
tax.
This phase goes hand in hand with the
gradual introduction of a large measure
of Socialism, which even the staunchest
Liberal would scarcely care to liquidate,
since it involves the basic principle of
an apparent —but far from a real —
something-for-nothing.
Furthermore, Parliament’s prestige is
being cut from under it by the acquire-
ment of masters to whom Parliament
itself as a whole is not technically
answerable. It holds a large and
powerful Opposition —powerful enough
indeed to keep the reins of Gov-
ernment for nine years and to paralyse
the Liberal-C.P. Government for another
year—which admits its abject submission
to a junta led by an ex-Communist and
which is largely financed by Communist-
led unions.
It is heartening to find on the Liberal
side a more tolerant attitude in the Par-
liamentary leadership, though how far
that tolerance will be allowed to go on
any question which affects large numbers
of votes only time and a test-case can
tell.
Mr. Kent Hughes became a Minister
despite the fact that his views on matters
of foreign policy were not orthodox by
Liberal standards; but it remains to be
seen whether Professor Armand Bland,
who replaces Mr. Spender in Warringah,
wjjl have similar latitude if he continues
the line of argument which marked his
speech in moving the adoption of the
Address-in-Reply. :
Mr. Bland said:
In the last decade the size of the Com-
monwealth Ministry has doubled and the
number of departments trebled. The
number of public servants has increased
fivefold. Every civil servant added to
the service is a potential threat to the
liberty of the individual.
He advocated, as The Bulletin has
long advocated, the calling of a Com-
monwealth convention to divest the
Federal Parliament of powers more
appropriately exercised by regional
bodies but taken over in the past 10 years
of “Labor”-generated centralisation, and
the handing-back of those powers to the
States, where they belong, so as to
associate their exercise more with local
necessity and local public opinion. He
said that the next Premiers’ conference
should discuss cutting down the numbers
of civil servants.
This viewpoint will scarcely be popular
either with some of Mr. Bland’s leaders
(though they advocated reduction in the
services in the 1949 campaign), but there
is no doubt, paradoxically, that centrali-
sation of authority at Canberra, and
particularly the growth of civil services
under the Socialism-cwm-vote-buying
technique of political parties during the
past decade, have been factors which
have tended to lower the status and
authority of Parliaments and Govern-
ments, both State and Federal,
The civil service, or at least its size, is
responsible for a vast proportion of the
ills which affect this country. If it is
not altogether large enough to dominate
elections it soon will be. It leans to
Socialism because Socialism is its busi-
ness. It is strong enough to force its
financial and employment - condition
demands on Governments. The
superiority of its conditions in general
to those of the bulk of workers, even in
these piping times of inflated plenty, is
proved by the reluctance of its members
to forsake non-productive Government
employment for productive private
employment.
It is no wonder that the public in
general regard the celebration of the
jubilee of Canberra’s Parliament with a
somewhat lack-lustre gaze. As Parlia-
ment is drifting at present there will
scarcely be any justification for its exist-
ance soon, and even now the decisions
of one half of it are made in detail out-
side its walls.
Ministries disregard it, or use it merely
as legalising machinery for their deci-
sions. Private individual members who
used to be accorded special time to initi-
ate or deal with matters affecting their
own electorates are now rarely accorded
that time. Trade-unions have come to
the stage of arrogance at which they claim
—and this is not only the Communist-
led unions, but many “moderate” ones as
well—to be above the law, with the right
to make their own legislation and set up
their own industrial courts.
If Mr. Menzies really wishes to cele-
brate 1951 he can call his own tune for
a monument if he succeeds in freeing
Parliament of outside-organisational con-
trol ; abolishes the need of candidates for
large sums of campaign funds before they
can secure election; also squeezes the
Socialism which exists in government
down to reasonable dimensions and at
the same time packs into useful and pro-
ductive industry the huge blocs of civil
servants who are paid mainly for resting
their feet.
If he can do that the time will be ripe
for a real Jubilee celebration.
Big Cities and Food.
All sorts of official controllers and price-
fixers are running in all sorts of direc-
tions trying to do something about the
current food shortages in the big cities.
The plain truth is that a situation which
has been steadily building up for many
years has been speeded up lately by
floods, transport muddles, strikes and
“controls.”
You cannot concentrate a third of the
population of a continent in two big
cities and a half in six cities, have them
all employed and making incomes which
allow them to eat more than they really
need, and at the same time have the rural
population declining, and expect the food-
supply to increase to meet the city
demands.
Add to the population ill-balance a
few things like floods, droughts, shortage
of machines and material and labor on
the land, bogged-down transport, and
controls exercised by all sorts of officials,
and you have a set-up which can result
only in the one now existing.
What has happened is that land pro-
duction has been steadily falling. The
chronic shortage of coal is reflected in
the shortage of butter. Man-hour output
could not continue to fall in secondary
industry without affecting output in pri-
mary industry. From the labor angle
alone, what man (unless of that philosophy
which deliberately prefers rural to city
life) will work for a farmer or struggle on
a small farm of his own while the city
offers him twice as much for doing com-
paratively nothing at all?
The note of bewildered astonishment in
the city Press over the inability of farmers
to keep the cities fed is laughable to
those who’ve watched the cities depopu-
late the country for a generation. It
used to be said that one farmer sup-
ported four city workers. Now he’s try-
ing to support eight or ten of them, in-
cluding herds of State and Federal em-
ployees and controllers of practically
everything the soil produces except wool.
What can be done about it? There is
no quick remedy. It is ten times as hard
to get people out of the city as into it.
Immigration is no help, since few modem
immigrants go to farms, lliough plenty
go into the selling and distribution or
foodstuffs. All the same, some sort ot
a start may be made by recognising the
true causes and giving away the silly
notions that more controls and increased
prices for land products will increase
those products.
Creation of two or three new States
may offer some solution by attracting
people from overpopulated centres to new
seats of provincial government,
which would spring up small farms, Siort
of that, about the only thing likely to
drive urbanised Australians out or their
cities is the famine which they will in*
evitaHy encounter if they persist m
crowding together and leaving the Jiano
to crows and rabbits.


PLAIN ENGLISH
They Are Expendable.
Some of those “Labor” politicians who
reputedly gave way to displays of grief at
the death of Mr. Chiiiey might have done
better had they saved their tears and
spent some of the moments of their
mourning in reflecting on the causes of
his passing and in consequent self-
reproach.
There seems little doubt but that the
arduous election campaign through which
he had been within the past two months,
following on a long illness due to an
overworked heart, brought about his
sudden death. And that election was a
wantonly unnecessary election not con-
cerned with any real and vital issues but
arising from the ruthless determination of
“Labor,” goaded by its outside juntas, to
hamper legitimate government by a
Ministry armed with a clear mandate.
“Labor’s” objective was to protect its
Communist allies irrespective of the
consequences to the country, to the
electors and to the people.
It was an election fiercely fought with-
out a hope that it would be won by
“Labor” — a mere tactic of obstruction.
It took a heavy toll in health and strength
of “Labor’s” fighting vanguard, as any-
body who has seen its members during
the past fortnight knows, apart from what
it obviously did to Mr. Chifley.
“Labor” is merciless to its servants,
about whom it feels no sentiment which
is not political. It is the party which
allowed Andy Dawson, its first member
to hold office as Premier, to end virtually
on a park bench. It has either killed most
of its leaders too young, broken their
health, or sent them fleeing disgusted with
its tactics, whereupon it behaves to them
as if they were worse than criminals.
Few have escaped these accustomed
fates —Mr. Lyons was weakened sadly in
health before he abandoned them;
Andrew Fisher retired weary and
sickened. T. J. Ryan died at 42, Watson
and Forgan Smith were glad to leave the
cave of hate and intrigue in which Par-
liamentary “Labor” dwells. Mat Charlton
was a saddened shadow of himself when
he retired; so was James Dooley. Mr.
Scullin was reduced to invalidism. It
is said that Mr. McGirr is breaking under
the strain of managing his unmanageable
Cabinet. And it was the widow of John
Curtin, over whom “Labor” wept as it is
now weeping over Mr. Chifley, who said
feelingly of the latter:
He didn’t have a fair go from quite a
lot of people, even on hiB own side. Indus-
trially they are very cruel they are
crippling' their leaders.
By the time this has been printed
“Labor” will probably have elected a
new leader. Indeed, long before Mr.
Chifley’s remains were consigned to earth,
the faction fights, the intrigue, the long-
term planning to secure the man pliable
and susceptible to A.L.P, discipline yet
moderate and strong in appearance to
the public, were in full swing. That bat-
talions of the various State branches of
the “religious bloc,” the anti-Communist
bloc, the Communist-union bloc, the
“moderate” bloc and the plain place-
hunters and agents of vested interests,
were all at work feeling out the possibili-
ties of producing the man from Galway
on whose brow the big bosses of Mr.
Ferguson’s polit-bureau might safely put
their brand of servitude.
Whoever he may be, those who know
the real nature of “Labor” and what its
“leaders” can expect from it will give him
their sympathy. For “Labor” will drive
him, will treat him as it always treats its
leaders —with no more consideration than
is due to another expendable weapon of
the class-war*
Parliament's Programme.
The Governor-General's speech sounded
rather bare and hackneyed because it
mainly reiterated matter which already
had been made public.
The Government is to implement its
mandate to carry on a full-scale cam-
paign against the Communists “by all
means which are or may be available to
it.” New ways and means of dealing
with subversive activities are to be
devised. The question is to be discussed
with the State Premiers at the imminent
conference —some of the Premiers have
already discussed it with their masters of
the A.L.P, and have no more intention
of giving the Commonwealth the use of
their powers than they have of going to
live in Moscow, The tendency of the
States in any case is not to give the Com-
monwealth more power but to try to keep
the little which has not been filched from
them. If they fail to respond to Com-
monwealth advances, as it was strongly
hinted they will, there will be a refer-
endum.
There is to be a new Defence Prepara-
tions Bill to develop national organisa-
tion by co-operative action where possible,
but, where not so possible, by compulsion.
And, since increasing defence outlay
would tend to exert upward pressure on
prices, checks require to be imposed by
legislation and perhaps call for the ex-
pansion of the Commonwealth’s consti-
tutional power to make this possible in
peace-time. If it is proved, that constitu-
tional limits interfere with the simul-
taneous attainment of defence prepara-
tion and economic stability, the Govern-
ment will submit to Parliament suit-
able amendments of the Constitution;
which, of course, will mean still another
referendum.
Beyond this there will be a new Security
Bill, badly needed, on the lines of the
British Official Secrets Act. The measures
to introduce secret ballots to elect union
officers and to strengthen the powers of
industrial tribunals will be reintroduced.
Dr. Page’s Health Bill will come forward
—it covers his scheme for medical bene-
fits, hospitals expansion and medical re-
search.
Negotiations for the Pacific Pact are
to be continued. Social-service benefits
and pensions are to be brought “into line
with current circumstances”; a part will
be played with other non-Communist
countries in co-ordinating strategic re-
sources ; efforts will be made to achieve
the earliest possible completion and signa-
ture of the Japanese peace-treaty. And,
of course, taxation is going up and postal,
telephone and telegraph charges are to
rise to “meet higher costs.”
There was no word about reduction of
civil servants or of any economy in the
many squandering departments whose
existence is one of the predisposing causes
of the climbing costs which Governments
spend most of their time chasing.
Spanish Straw in the Wind.
French elections concluded, the U.S.
Government is expected to bring before
the nations of the Atlantic Pact for final
settlement the business of admitting
Spain, on military and strategic grounds.
Opposition to the proposal has hitherto
been particularly strong in France and
Britain, and it was evidently the part of
discretion to avoid giving French Com-
munists excuse during the elections for
playing upon French electors’ sentiments.
The American Press has, in the past,
been anything but unanimous on the
question and New York “Times” dis-
tinctly hostile. But the arguments have
been well thrashed out, and the American
joint chiefs of staff hold that America’s
European allies in Western Europe would
not, in the present tempo of rearmament,
be able to retain a foothold on the con-
tinent outside Spain if Soviet Russia
should attack in the next 18 months.
Recalling this view, the Washington
corresppndent of Melbourne “Age” re-
ports that the United States Government
has decided Spain must be brought into
the Western defence system (created
under American aid), and that if neces-
sary the U.S. Government will make a
bilateral pact with Spain for the pur-
pose. There is nothing cut and dried
about the project, for Congress has to be
injected with more enthusiasm than it has
shown yet. Franco, too, has his own
ideas of bargaining. But he is also in
aoute hunger for dollar-aid.
America’s exhausted allies of World
War II have swallowed, or got ready to
swallow, far too many camels to permit
any great straining over this gnat. The
accepted principle of reinstatement for
“Fascist” ex-enemy Powers—ltaly, Ger-
many, and now Japan —and the provision
of new credits for Yugoslavia by Britain
and France as well as U.S. A. are all much
too tendentious for the success of any
pretences about the need for continued
black - balling of Franco’s Spain—
especially as the location of the safest
airfields, ports and defence perimeter
against a Russian overrunning of Europe.
Post-office as a Luxury.
It is high time that some attention was
given in Parliament —and from outside
the Cabinet—to the condition of the
department which provides the mails and
other daily communication services of the
“common man.” Mr. Hughes has pub-
licly resurrected the interests of this
much-bullied individual. It might be
added that the dogs of privilege are not,
as Billy said, quite dead; for Parliamen-
tarians enjoy complete immunity from
one of the harshest measures of indirect
taxation today—that on the postal depart-
ment’s services.
P.M.G. Anthony has announced that
letter-rates and telephone charges are to
be increased further. The present charges
have already made all mails and tele-
phone conversations a luxury. A step
higher on these would take the tax —for
that is what it modernly is—on use of
them (of the mails at any rate) back to
the dark ages of post-Napoleonic condi-
tions.
For years of pre-war prosperity the
Australian post-office annually turned
millions of surplus earnings into con-
solidated revenue. No doubt that was
the beginning of the decline of the post-
Office from its proper function. It was
under the Chifley Government that the
post-office—losing money for the first
time in its long life —raised its letter and
other charges. But the post-office today
is simply losing more money than ever.
Already the ludicrous business of trying
to meet overhead costs by discouraging
customers is making fools of those respon-
sible. He can’t increase the public call-
booth charge of 2d., says the P.M.G.,
because the pay-boxes are made to take
pennies only, and they fill rapidly enough
now with two-a-time. And as there are
some 14,000 or 15,000 of these through-
out the Commonwealth, the job of re-
placing them to take sixpences, shillings
(or even, perhaps, in time, 10-bob notes)
would start another hopeless chasing
game. Yet if public calls remain at 2d.
and private phones are taxed 3d., 4d.
or 6d., the “common man” will naturally
make his calls in the cheapest place.
For years past the post-office has been
used as a taxing body; and in addition
to its surpluses it has been in the habit
of charging to revenue huge sums of
capital expenditure. Surely the present is
a time for equalisation: for the recogni-
tion of previous surpluses and capital
charged to revenue, and the transfer from
consolidated revenue now of some of
the money that will otherwise form a
general Budget surplus this year. After
all, postal charges do seriously enter into
the cost of living, and it would be an
appropriate time for inflation victims to
get the benefit of some of what they had
previously overpaid.
Also, the postal department itself re-
quires some overhauling. It suffers build-
ing and other disabilities similar to the
rest of the economy, but during the reign
of the Socialists its efficiency was im-
paired by the intrusion of more acute
trade-union problems, and Senator
Cameron, then P.M.G., was, of course,
all in favor of militant unionism.
These problems of the post-office are
not going to be solved merely by raising
charges. The main thing is to Restore
efficiency. Economies might help more in
that direction than a continuance of
slugging the public.
Commission Not Needed.
The haste which Mr. McGirr showed in
acceding to the N.S.W. Opposition’s
demand for a royal commission on liquor
was that of a man who has been presented
with a reprieve by accident and hurries
off before the mistake is discovered.
Mr. Treatt had told the N. S. Wales
Government that it wasn’t “game to
shape up to the liquor question”; and it
isn’t. Neither, for that matter, does any
other party seem to be on the showing
of the last few years, and a royal com-
mission is a nice, showy way out for all
of them. It provides a semblance of do-
ing something without the necessity of
really doing anything—at least for a long
time.
Thus all parties are happy and unani-
mous about procedure, and Mr. McGirr,
who usually snarls when the Opposition
makes a suggestion and hurriedly applies
the gag, was seen moving a few amend-
ments to widen the scope of the inquiry
—and, of course, delay the finding-
before he resorted to the usual procedure
of the guillotine.
Now the royal commission is in train
to inquire into hotel-ownership by
brewery companies and their financial
interest in and control of hotels; the
tied-house system in the liquor trade;
the action of Section 41, to ascertain how
far certain matters concerning the
breweries operate against the public in-
terest ; local option ; adequacy of arrange-
ments for transfers of licences; the need
or otherwise for additional club licences ;
whether the provision for accommodation
and meals is adequate; whether liquor
is being fairly distributed, and “such other
matters as the Government considers
necessary.”
Most of these things are dealt with by
law already, and no royal commission is
needed to show how the law is being
carried out. The police, if they would,
could tell as much as, or more than, the
royal commission, and at less cost. And
if they don’t know, the public knows and
every dog is barking that the liquor laws,
so far as they are designed to protect the
public in regard to drinking and lodging
accommodation, supply and price of
liquor and general amenities, are a dead-
letter in N. S. Wales.
Early-closing does not exist in some
centres. Beer in bottles is sold oply on
the blackmarket at illegal prices, or as a
premium for steady soakers in particular
sars.
Instead of having a royal commission,
what needs to be done is to enforce the
law strictly without fear or favor. If
Mr. McGirr isn’t strong enough to do it
he should ask Mr. Tom Piayford, of
South Australia, to come over fora week
or two and act as his deputy. On the
standard of service, decorum and avail-
ability of good accommodation, civil
treatment, meals and reasonable amounts
of liquor at reasonable times, not to
mention the absence of the pig-trough
drinking which makes Sydney’s hotels the
most disgraceful in atmosphere in the
world, South Australia is an object-lesson
in what can be done by a Government
which is not afraid of the liquor vote.
Curiously enough, the liquor trade in
Adelaide seems to like the results of the
discipline there, and to be proud of its
standards and scornful of Sydney’s.
N.Q. Doesn't Wont Excuses.
Townsville Chamber of Commerce, on
the eve of a new sugar-crushing season
with an expected increase in the num-
ber of ships likely to be coming to the
port for sugar, was startled to discover
that during the past year several ships
had arrived in ballast from the south,
and the practice was expected to con-
tinue, though shiploads of cargo for
North Queensland lie waiting in southern
ports.
It asked the Australian Shipping Asso-
ciation and the Stevedoring Industry
Board about it. The A.S.O. said that
though the tonnage of shipping on
Queensland coast had increased since be-
fore 1939, it had not grown in propor-
tion to the rising demand for cargo space,
that ships were not available to main-
tain a regular service, that ships by-
passed N.Q. ports because of wharf-
labor shortages, and that southern manu-
facturers weren’t prepared to wait for
ships and sold goods elsewhere which
would otherwise go to N.Q.
The 5.1.8. said that very often there
was a labor surplus on N.Q. wharves,
and quoted figures showing that though
in 1949-50 there were 123 days when
labor was short, there 125 days
when labor was surplus, and that for
the 12 months to May 31 last Towns-
ville wharfies had averaged fewer than
30 hours a week, except in the October-
December quarter, and earnings had
fluctuated from £9 to £ll 10s. a week.
It asked how the wharfies could be ex-
pected to maintain a full labor force
under these conditions when work at
higher pay offered elsewhere.
All of which left the chamber cold. It
accused the A.S.O. of adopting a “nega-
tive attitude” in accepting the go-slows
in the south which held up ships and
“bowing to the dictates of the Com-
munist-controlled Waterside Workers’
Federation.” It restrained itself over the
5.1.8., but pointed out that whereas
162,395 tons of cargo were discharged
in Townsville and Cairns in 1939, only
93,919 tons were discharged in both ports
in’l949. Further remarking that rele-
vant rail figures were 54,159 tons in
1939 and 85,594 in 1949, the chamber
mordantly invited someone to tell it
what the deuce N.Q. Harbor Boards
were contemplating heavy spending on
port improvements for.
That this sort of trouble is not con-
fined to N.Q. ports is no consolation to
N.Q. people, and the Townsville Cham-
ber is not in a mood to accept official
apologies. It intends to go after co-
operation between shippers, railways and
stevedores, to seek a regular cargo ser-
vice or some system of nominating ves-
sels to carry cargo and to stir up N.Q.
Federal members. It should also ask
Canberra how the north can be de-
veloped as a defence area if the goods
it needs are allowed to lie useless m
southern ports.
Revolt in the Country.
Most N.S.W. country centres now “en-
joy” blackouts, though they didn’t until
the State Electricity Authority was
created to control power in N.S.W. This
EA inaugurated a system of “feeding
in” and “feeding out” power which was
supposed to equalise the State’s power
resources or something, but only made
the growing confusion worse confounded.
At Tamworth recently a conference of
11 councils drawing power from
Tamworth station tartly announced that
it didn’t want any interference with the
station by the Electricity Authority. As
reported by the “Shire and Municipal

CARRERAS LIMITED - OVER 150 YEARS REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
Record,” the chairman (Aid. Varley,
mayor of Tam worth) put it this way:
We do not want the undertaking to come
under the control of a [proposed] county
council. We believe that if the occasion
arises where it will be controlled from
Sydney the whole northern area will suffer.
A delegate who had accompanied the
Electricity Authority on a tour of the
district said he was convinced all it
sought was an excuse of any sort to
create a county council to take over
generation and distribution of electricity.
Another, who had heard the E.A. spout-
ing at Murrurundi, said, “the whole thing
had been carefully rehearsed some weeks
previously,” and that the E.A. had con-
fessed it didn’t know how Tamworth sup-
plied electricity as cheaply as it did.
When somebody else said that from the
moment Tamworth yielded control it
could expect blackouts and a woman
delegate said none of the women in the
area wanted what Sydney housewives had
to endure, the decision to oppose the
notion “strenuously” was unanimous.
Meantime, Orange has discovered that
politics play their part in blackouts. The
cherry city was free of them until, in the
words of the “Shire and Municipal
Record”: •
The State Electricity Commissioner, Mr.
Conde, recently put an end to Orange’s
long blackout-free record by ordering the
council to have blackouts, despite the fact
that it had been shedding the required elec-
tricity load without interruptions to its nor-
mal service.
Orange’s mayor and engineer are to
beard Premier McGirr, Minister Cahill
and Mr, Conde “immediately” to de-
mand an explanation and revocation of
the order. Mayor Jaeger said that
Orange, through the efficiency of its
engineer and the co-operation of local
users, had performed the required “load-
shedding” without blackouts, and it was
obvious that other communities had
noticed Orange’s freedom and were ask-
ing questions.
POLITICAL POINTS
In his lifetime this paper was one of
the most consistent critics and opponents
of J. B. Chifley’s policies; it does not
believe he would expect or wish his death
to change its opinion of him. It feels
that he would probably shudder more at
some of the praise showered upon his
memory since last Wednesday than at all
the abuse hurled at him during his poli-
tical career.
Believing, as it does, that Mr. Chifley’s
regime was a calamity to Australia, and
that his attempts to introduce socialisa-
tion would, if successful, have ruined
the Commonwealth, The Bulletin
cannot subscribe to the Prime Minister’s,
generous comment that the late “Labor”
eader “served this country magnificently.”
He served his party magnificently, and in
doing so he honestly believed he was
serving Australia. If, in choosing his
successor, “Labor” finds a man who will
give it the same unselfish service with
equal sincerity it will be fortunate indeed.
Any student wishing to write a thesis
on absenteeism should take a peek at
the record of the McGrrrrrs over the
past 12 months. Since the 36th N. S.
Wales Parliament was elected on June 19,
1950, there have been only about four
dozen days on which the whole of its
legislators have not been absent from the
halls in which they are supposed to
legislate. The House rose again last
week; members will be absent till Sep-
tember 12. Unlike absentees in industry,
they are paid whether they punch the
bundy or not.
Reason for McGrrrrr’s apparent dis-
like of keeping the House in session is
not far to seek. He is never really sure
whether his majority of one is for him
or agin him, and he thinks it more pru-
dent not to find out.
As anticipated, the Senate, in dividing
itself into long-term and short-term
groups as provided in the Constitution,
voted the six-year terms to the five
Senators first elected in each State. This
means that 18 Government and 12
“Labor” Senators will retain their seats
until 1956. It also means that even if
“Labor” wins every State in two years’
time —a thing that no party has yet
managed to do—it cannot do better than
break even in the Senate. So much for
the Evatt-Calwell scheme for grabbing
control of the Upper House.
In both Houses at Canberra last week
there was urged the holding of another
Federal Convention to discuss the
powers of Federal and State Govern-
ments. In the Reps. Professor Bland,
moving the adoption of the Address-in-
Reply, made an appeal for “a restora-
tion of the substance of Federalism,”
which he thought could best be done by
such a convention ; he felt that the Com-
monwealth should drop many of the
functions it had taken upon itself during
the last few years. In the Upper House
Senator Cormack told his colleagues that
this year they should decide
whether or not the Commonwealth con-
vention should be reconstituted to discuss
whether or not the Commonwealth should
continue its growth as a centralised
Government.
A convention is long overdue ; it is to be
hoped that the remarks of Bland and
Cormack indicate that Canberra intends
to take the initiative and convene it.
Speculation about the succession to the
Macquarie seat centres round Senator
McKenna ; also touches Nelson Lemmon,
another of the late leader’s white-haired
boys whom he brought to Sydney after
his defeat in W.A. in 1949 to stand for
St. George against Bruce Graham. It was
one of Mr. Chifley’s greatest disappoint-
ments in the campaign that Graham
proved immovable. Macquarie, however,
is a peculiar electorate; it may have
views of its own.
On Friday Sydney Milk Board stopped
supplies of milk to offices, warehouses and
factories. The Beer Board’s offer to
supply an alternative fluid is to be con-
sidered next week.
Independents hold the balance of power
in Eire’s Parliament. It was the defec-
tion of some of their number from sup-
port of the Costello Government which
brought about the recent dissolution and
election ; the decision of five of them to
support De Valera has brought the old
Republican back to power at 68. Dev.
will be hard put to find a policy. He
can’t threaten any more to break the
last link with Britain; Costello broke it
three years ago.
It’s to be hoped that the change of
Government in Quid Oireland won’t make
too much difference in the style of debate
in Dublin’s Dail Eireann. It would be a
shame to see the disappearance of this
sort of exchange, as recorded by London
“Spectator”:
Captain Cowan: Would it be in order for
me to call the deputy over there a sewer-
rat?
Mr. Speaker: No.
Captain Cowan: Thank you; the sewer-
rats will be grateful for that ruling.
Conde, the Sydney blackout man, spoke
out of New York last week, saying that he
was “confident that N.S.W. would get
satisfactory priorities to enable fairly
quick deliveries of American power-
units.” He added that he was “required
to give all sorts of information to satisfy
Washington officials of immediate require-
ments.” If he’d simply told them about
McGrrrrr it would have been sufficient.
Mackay canegrowers and others who
answered the call to get the Wellpark
loaded with sugar for New Zealand when
the Waterside Workers’ Federation de-
clared her black are rightly incensed at
the way they were summarily put off the
job as soon as the wharfies, under threat
of deregistration of their union, lifted
the ban. The volunteers had loaded more
than 5000 tons of the cargo at a rate
considerably higher than the wharfies’
average, and only about 500 tons re-
mained to complete the shipment. Im-
mediately the news was received last
Wednesday that the Wellpark was
“white” the volunteers were told they
would not be required after lunch;
W.W.F. men were engaged to finish the
cargo. This is a clumsy and shabby
way of treating men who came forward
willingly in response to the Government’s
call. The authorities should realise that
with the type of men who worked the
Wellpark it is not merely a matter of
doing a job and being paid for it; the
sense of service and the satisfaction of
having helped in an emergency mean
much more, and these could only com-
pletely be realised by letting the
volunteers finish the job and get the ship
away.
In the Wellpark affair the wharfies
had it both ways. They had their strike,
then immediately they decided to go back
to work they had the pleasure of seeing
the volunteers pushed aside to make way
for them. The “Labor” Government
used to work on the principle that the
watersiders must never be offended. It
seems that something of that policy still
lingers.
There is talk of importing butter from
New Zealand. Nothing will be done, of
course, until the Seamen’s Union decides
which side of its bread to put it on.
According to Haylen, M.H.R., “We
have seen the end of the 60-hour working
week, the days when mother toiled with
a scrubbing-brush and drew water from
the creek.” Too right, and now mother
has daily electricity blackouts, can’t
buy butter or spuds, pays 4£d. for an egg,
has to lug her groceries home herself,
frequently has no gas to cook them, can’t
get a seat in bus or tram, is tired all the
time and fed-up with the whole box-and-
dice. If there was a creek handy she’d
probably jump into it—or push Mr.
Haylen in.
Through a breakdown in supplies of
tinplate, shortages were threatened in all
canned goods—jam, preserved fruits,
boot-polish and so on. Then, as an after-
thought, a shortage of bottle-tops was
mentioned. The reaction was immedi-
ate ; 20,000,000 bottle-tops are to be
imported.
Victoria’s Young Liberals have de-
cided to ask the L.C.P. for explanations of
its policies on lotteries, rent-control, off-
course betting, and the Greater Melbourne
plan. The Y.Ls. are against “economic
controls,” against granting Canberra
more powers to down Communists, and
in favor of giving private enterprise a go
at doing big Government works. This
comes of encouraging youngsters to think
and opens up dreadful possibilities for
party heads.
Close on the heels of McGrrrrr’s
acquisition of Sydney Ferries, a once-
profitable concern ruined by high costs
and competition with Government trams
and buses which don’t have to show a
profit, comes news that the Illawarra and
South Coast Steam Navigation Company
is to sell its only two remaining ships.
Reasons advanced by the directors are
“rising costs, slow turn-round, rail and
road competition.”
If Joe Stalin doesn’t turn over soqn a

Colin Clark, the Queensland economist
who usually knows what he’s talking
about, told a women’s club in Brisbane
that it was no use their expecting cheaper
food for at least 20 years. It’s not so
much cheaper food that bothers the
average housewife, but where to buy it.
If butter jumped to ss. a pound and milk
to 2s. a pint supplies would still be short,
and the same applies to potatoes, meat,
eggs, fruit and fish.
In the Victorian by-election on Satur-
day “Labor” retained by 1100 votes the
Prahran seat, vacant through the elec-
tion of Frank Crean as M.H.R. for Mel-
bourne Ports. New member: R. F.
Pettiona.
One of the best speeches made for
years by a new member of the Federal
Parliament in moving the Address-in-
Reply stands to the credit of Professor
Armand Bland, who replaced Mr. Percy
Spender in Warringah. It was so much
above the average in logic and indepen-
dence of spirit that it scarcely seemed
real.
The 1951 issue of Australia’s most
widely-read paper will be available to the
public this week —a new and revised edi-
tion of the income-tax form. S’Artie’s
long-promised “simplified” form will
get its first try-out.
In Poland there was much rejoicing
last month because Russia had graciously
swapped a slice of oil-bearing country
near Drogobych (not pronounced as
spelt) for an agricultural area between
Lvov and Kovel. The official attitude
w'as that it was a generous action on the
part of the Soviet to give Poland these
oil-wells. Apparently the Pole in the
street was not expected to remember that
Drogobych was part of the territory
seized by Russia when Stalin and Hitler
cut Poland in halves in 1939.
Christopher Mayhew, Attlee’s Under-
secretary for Foreign Affairs till he lost
his seat (Norfolk) at the general election,
is back in the Commons as member for
East Woolwich, formerly held by Ernest
Bevin. Ernie won the seat last year by
12,000; Mayhew’s majority at the by-
election was 7000. During his enforced
holiday from Parliament Mayhew has
turned to writing; a thriller of his is on
next Sunday’s television programme, with
the author in a small part—he kills a
Soviet U.N. delegate. Attlee had better
not send him to Lake Success after that.
If Fadden wants to increase taxation
in the coming year to cover defence
preparations, he will have to do some-
thing about the wave of direct taxation
now piling up in vastly increased and
increasing rates imposed by municipalities
and shires. So will the fair-rents courts.
The task of choosing a new leader
couldn’t have come at a more awkward
time for “Labor.” The party is divided
into groups allied more by their dislikes
than their likes, and the dislikers are
subdivided again. On Monday factions
were trying to sort themselves out for
yesterday’s meeting, and it seemed prob-
able that the new leader would be elected
not by the votes of those who liked him
best, but by the votes of those who dis-
liked someone else more.

“Findy”: Photographs of Speaker
Archie Cameron being led to the Chair
by his sponsors and “formally resisting
to show traditional modest reluctance to
accept the Speakership” set me pondering
whether that little bit of play-acting isn’t
the most difficult task in a Speaker’s whole
career. His problem is just how much he

should resist and just what degree of
modest reluctance he should show. It
would obviously be quite wrong for him
to rush ahead of his sponsors, shouting
“Bags I the Chair,” and it would be
equally undignified for him to crawl under
the Opposition benches and defy all and
sundry to drag him out. Then again, if
he struggles too earnestly on the way
to the Chair, the two members leading
him might think he means it and take him
back to his old seat. Acually the little
ceremony calls for a nice display of tact
and judgment of the very type the Speaker
is called upon to exercise after he has
taken the Chair. Probably it is not really
a tradition at all, but rather a sort of
test of the elected man’s suitability for
the job.

“The Chalky”: If “Pawang” (B.
23/5/’5l) had more than glanced at De
Madariaga’s “On Hamlet” he would have
found that the professor defends the
thesis that Hamlet and Ophelia were
lovers, that Hamlet’s obscene, neurotic
outbursts were inspired by the thought
that Ophelia had been induced to betray
him to Polonius and the King. It is this
faithlessness, claims De Madariaga, com-
ing after the Queen’s too-hasty posting
to incestuous sheets, that drags profuse
carnal imagery from the secret corners
of Hamlet’s unconscious mind. Ophelia,
driven mad by a rejection she cannot
understand, and by the murder of her
father, discloses the intimacy between
herself and Hamlet in a bawdy song.
“Pawang’s” backing of Shakspeare’s
powers of observation is futile. The
function of the literary professor is to
judge the results of his author’s observa-
tion, not to display his own. Dr.
Johnson had something to say on the
subject; “You may abuse a tragedy,
though you cannot write one. You
may scold a carpenter who has made
you a bad table, though you cannot
make a table. It is not your trade to
make tables.”

“Kelms”: Having experienced long,
overcrowded train journeys during which
most of the troops got drunk and
passed, with varying success, through the
subsequent stages, I heartily endorsed the
action of any O.C. train who placed pubs
out of bounds (B. 9/2/’5l). But I had
to admire the strategy of a mate who
always contrived to have beer on a
journey. Once when the train was halted
at a station he got
past the M-Ps. and
reached the pub.
He was sighted
coming back and
found every
entrance barred. At
last, with a good-
natured grin, he
came through the
main entrance,
resignedly passed
over his two bottles
of beer to the
equally good-natured provosts, and re-
joined us in the compartment. There he
produced the other two bottles he’d
hidden beneath his greatcoat. He used
the same strategy several times.

“B, A. Ker”; An expression I haven’t
heard for years is the scornful “Yair,
about the feet!” In my youth it was
the invariable answer when somebody
did not agree with an expressed opinion
that a particular girl was pretty. But I
could never see that it was as scathing
as it was intended to be. A girl with
pretty feet would be as rare as a gold
guinea. If anybody is too gallant to
think so, let him devote 10 minutes on a
beach to observation of feminine extremi-
ties. It is noticeable that in Hollywood
“cheese-cake” photos the starlet may
display every possible square-inch of her
person—except her bare feet, which are
always buried in the sand, tucked out of
sight, or encased in high-heeled shoes.
Thus does the amateur betray herself. In
sundry Swimsuit Siren contests the entrant
ruins a pretty picture with a prominent
pair of bunioned, toe-distorted, corny
tootsies. But perhaps I’m getting old —
looking at their feet!

“Irving”; Long-’uns and short-’uns (B.
30/ 5/ ’5l) as an indication of the age and
dignity of adolescents have different
meanings in the case of the two sexes if
the assumption made some time ago by
a fatherly Brisbane Beak is correct. In
“You’ve forgotten something. Professor!"
settlement of an argument as to what
age a youthful female witness could
reasonably have been, his Worship
decreed: “Young males and young
females do things differently, and whether
they are at school or at work has nothing
to do with it. Personally, I find it a
good rule to regard any lad in short
trousers as a schoolboy, and as a half-axe
if he wears long-’uns. If I have reason
to believe that a young female is wearing
long trousers, which were once called
‘bloomers,’ I see her as a schoolgirl. If
she wears shorts, which I understand are
called ‘pantees,’ then I see her as a ’teen-
ager.”

P. O. MacCabe: As a sprat of about
three years it was my pleasure to run
through sections of the 30in. pipes used
in the Goldfields water-scheme (B.
6/6/’5l). Later I witnessed a pipe-burst
near Merredin, the force of which blew
sizeable gum saplings clear out of the
ground. I recollect indulging the childish
whim of dropping two pennies in the
cauldron of molten lead with which the
replacement was caulked. It amuses me
now to reflect that I have tuppence in
hard cash invested in the scheme. My
father, who commenced his term under
C. Y. O’Connor as surveyor of No. 1
pumping-station at Mundaring, and
retired district engineer at Northam,
always spoke of O’Connor (and none
other) as the presiding genius before and
behind the great undertaking.

“Melb’n”: University rags are usually
dull and lacking in imagination, but there
was one once in Melbourne which had a
dash of humor. The stage was all set
for the Head of the River race; the Yarra
banks were crammed with partisans of all
sides, and the judges were alertly waiting
when two boats whizzed round a bend
and Wesley and Scotch fought a grim
fight to the finish. Almost neck-and-neck
they crossed the line, the gun was fired
and Scotch was declared the wikmer.
The yelling had scarcely subsided when
two more boats whizzed round the bend
and Scotch and Wesley were again seen
fighting out the finish; but this time Wesley
was declared the winner. Two Melbourne
University colleges, wearing colors the
same as the two colleges mentioned, had
started off from a rendezvous a quarter
of a mile or so ahead of the official
starting-point.

“Observer”: At the Rugby League
football-match, France v. Australia, I sat
next to a hoodlum behind whom was a
Frenchman who appeared to be a
barracker for Aubert, for he often shouted
something that sounded like “Magnifisong,
Ohbear.” This got on the hoodlum’s
nerves and he said “Shut your mouth, you
French .” The Frenchman
reached over, pulled the hoodlum’s hat
over his eyes and hit him on the jaw.
The larrikin simply took it; neither by
word nor action did he respond. Then
the Frencliman settled back in his seat
and shouted “Magnifisong, Ohbear.”
* * * *
“Becks”: What’s all this about shortage
of newsprint and of the high cost of that
commodity? I received today a souvenir
copy of “The Eastern Suburbs and South
Sydney News.” Printed on good-quality
newsprint, with a cover and pictorial
supplement of heavy art paper, it com-
prises 48 pages of approximately the same
size as a Bulletin page. Letterpress con-
sists largely of historical articles which
tell the story of the origins and growth
of every suburb from South Head to La
Perouse, with reminiscences of old iden-
tities of the district, and the paper contains
scores of photographs of the beaches,
historic buildings and other places of
interest. The claim is made by the pub-
lishers that their paper is the biggest ever
issued in Australia at the price. The
claim is probably justified as the price is
nil, the paper being produced for free
circulation in the area covered. Admit-
tedly my copy took rather a long time
to reach me, but that is probably my
own fault. It’s dated December, 1928,
and I wasn’t living in Sydney in those days.

“V. Cluse”: Our crowded bus was
crawling citywards through Sydney’s flat-
land. The morning was wet and gloomy,
the passengers grumpy and withdrawn, the
conductor snappy, the traffic ahead and
behind in a snarl, and the soft, wetting,
smoke-greasy rain fell maddeningly. We
halted again, this time opposite a flight
of steps coming down to the street from
a block of flats high overhead, and on
the bottom step, spread in the rain, lay
a pink, niched “foundation garment.”
Dainty and forlorn, was it mute testimony
of a business-girl in a hurry or evidence
of the kind of party these flats are sus-
pected of enclosing by night? Nobody
will ever know, but grins appeared on
the male faces in the bus, stranger met
stranger with a wink, an impalpable air
of naughtiness and impropriety lifted the
gloom, and the bus rolled on.

“Roscoe”: Clem Lack (B. 13/6/’5l)
also oversimplifies on the cause of
France’s downfall in 1870 and 1940.
Faith in defensive operations would cer-
tainly have contributed to these defeats,
but there were other weighty reasons —
German superiority in men and materials,
poor French morale, largely because of
fifth-column activities of both Left and
Right, and Government misdirection.
Incidentally, I recently spotted a Sydney
“Sun” headline which made me wonder
whether these inquiries into French mili-
tary matters might soon become of grave
national importance —“Churchill Confi-
dent of Beating France.” Then it struck
me that the Churchill named was not the
British war-leader but a young fellow who
was to skipper Australia’s Rugby League
team against a visiting French team.
* * * •
“Clooter”: An aesthetic drabness of
the male in these post-war days of dear
worsted and unskilled tailoring is the
double-breasted, striped suit. Pause in
a city street and watch the men go by.
Nine of every ten wear these reach-me-
downs, and everybody knows you can buy
’em for about two-thirds of the price of
a tailored suit. Few, however, realise it
is their mass-produced sausage-machine
manufacture that keeps them compara-
tively cheap. Sizes and fit? Oh, yes,
that’s taken care of by a scale of what
the slop shops call “half” and “quarter”
sizes, and if you’re neither the thing can
be altered for a few bob to give a reason-
able fit. Still, who am I to grumble?
The tailored suit which once cost me £8
Bs. now costs £3l 10s., and if it weren’t
for the ready-to-wear double-breaster
with the stripes most of us would be
coming to work in football jerseys or out-
fits bought at Army-disposals stores.

“Kelms”: An unusual case was recently
decided in a Perth court. Two fishermen
alleged that, while they were attempting
to net a catch of salmon off Hopetoun,
they were prevented by a third man who
intercepted and dispersed the fish. The
judge found in their favor, but disagreed
with their estimate of the size of the
catch that got away. They reckoned it
would have gone 10 tons. He made it
two and a half tons, calculating its value
at 80 quid, and entered judgment for that
amount.

“Pip Tok”: Let me assure “Fairf” (B.
2/5/’5l) that there is such a thing as
“mike-fright,” though the presence of a
visible audience may give an apparent
immunity to exhibitionists of the type he
mentions. People who give broadcast
talks are the ones who feel uneasy. On
my first experience of a 15-minute talk, I
was seated before a “mike” in an other-
wise empty room. Colored lights gave
the signals to stand-by and to start, and
FOUNTAIN PENS
"On second thoughts I WILL have a ball-point.”
the whole thing seemed cold-bloodedly
impersonal. Accustomed to lecturing and
to the convivial atmosphere of after-
dinner speeches, I missed the helpful co-
operation between speaker and listener,
which is such an aid to a platform
speaker. Even a spot of dissent or heck-
ling would have been welcome. I made
many broadcasts before I got over those
first few moments of uneasiness. Many
experienced platform speakers prove poor
broadcasters because they miss the live
audience. Parsons, as a rule, are good
radio speakers because the pulpit-manner
is more conversational and thus better
for radio.

“Swelpme”: In the wife’s “Preserved
for posterity” drawer I unearthed a
yellowed newspaper-cutting—the local
rag’s account of our wedding. Obviously
the paper’s current habit of leaving out a
vital word here and there, skipping an
odd line or two and generally getting the
bull by the tail preserves a hallowed
tradition. I find with amazement that I
was the son of my mother-in-law, and
my brother attended as vest man. One
of the bridesmaids wore “pink romaine
and a picture.” But the bride must have
caused a stir that I was not aware of at
the time. She “entered the church on her
father” and was “beautifully gowned in
a pink orchid.” I have always maintained
that the bridegroom should not be placed
in the traditional position—with his back
to the door.

“Sackfair”; Latest innovation in our
shopping centre is demonstrated by
garbage-bins that also serve as silent-
sandwichboard-men. For some weeks
the bins vainly proclaimed on all four
sides: “This advertising-space to let”;
then gradually the spaces began to fill
up until two only remained. For some
not perceptible reason no tradesman
desired to advertise his wares on those
particular sides. Months have passed,
and still nobody has rented the advertised
advertising-space. There looks to be only
one remedy; more bins to advertise the
advertisement advertising advertising-
space.

“Laetitia”: Those Syrian sugar stealers
who slashed the bags (B. 23/5/’5l) could
learn a lot from Binghi. In my northern
store sugar which reached me after several
handlings by native crews and cargo
laborers was usually short-weight, but it
was a long time before I found out why.
Finally I caught the pillagers on the job.
Each was at work on a bag of sugar in
the mouth of which a dried tubular grass-
stem had been inserted between slightly-
eased stitches; they were laboriously
siphoning out the spoil, a few grains at
a time. In their demoralisation at their
unexpected unmasking they made a clean
breast of past misdemeanors, showing me
also how flour-bags were rifled without
visible disturbance of the sacks. This
was managed by placing the sack on a
blanket and then flailing it till enough for
a damper filtered through as dust,

“Metax”; In a shop full of people I
was jammed against the counter, waiting
my turn. A slight scuffle on my right was
followed by a sharp jab in the ribs as a
savage-looking old gent, with a nose like
an eagle jostled his way through the
crowd. Glaring fiercely across the counter
he roared his demands at the nearest
salesman: “Three shillings-worth of caps
for a Ned Kelly gun.”

“Muskeen”: Masculine vanities (B.
30/5/’51)? One of our homegrown
Highlanders attended a charity bridge do
in kilt, philabeg and a’, his knees being
a beautiful golden-brown acquired from
a gravy-essence bottle. On leaving the
bridge-table at supper-time he, and every-
one else, found that his knee-tan had
changed to dirty white-and-brown smears.
The hostess’s Pomeranian had made an
hors-d’oeuvre of the gravy-essence.

“Mat’s Mate”; There’s a railway cross-
ing somewhere between Gawler and
Terowie (S.A.), and there Mat and I
arrived one Sunday morning just in time
to see two blokes hopping into one an-
other. We watched the disturbance until
one retired, beaten and uttering sundry
disparaging remarks, and accepted the
victor’s invitation to a pub up the road.
About a week later a policeman found
us on the railway job and served sub-
poenas, whereupon we discovered that
one of the belligerents was suing the other
for assault and we were in as witnesses.
“You’ll be for the plaintiff,” said the
constable. “And I gotta warn y’ that one
of the things the Beak will want to know
is why, if y’ seen ’em brawlin’, y’ didn’t
go t’ the plaintiff’s assistance.” Mat
pondered this, then, “Aw, that’ll be easy
answered,” he said. “How the hooray
could we tell who’d be the plaintiff till
the brawl was over?”

“Fairf”; Talking to a young fellow
who makes felt hats for a living, I
pricked up my ears when he mentioned
that wet felt-fur actually grows. It re-
minded me of my first glimpse of bush-
tragedy. I was still a schoolboy and had
accompanied a neighbor’s kid to bring
home their horse from an agistment pad-
dock. The horse wasn’t in sight, and the
paddock covered a square mile or so of
open country and patches of scrub. We
tramped a long way before we found him
—or his remains. Even to schoolboys
the story was plain; the broken-down
fence near the creek, a loose, stretched
wire lying on the ground like a drawn
bowstring, a fence-post on either side and
the dead grey’s leg attached to the centre.
Obviously the horse had kicked at some-
“He’s been doing that ever since he lost his voice."
thing when near the fence and the wire
had hooked fast between hoof and shoe,
The thought of how that poor animal
must have struggled and suffered before
he died of thirst—with the sound of the
running creek in his ears—haunted my
nights for months. But the hatter’s re-
mark recalled that I was both horrified
and fascinated by the long silvery tail—
it seemed to have attached itself to the
ground and grown longer. Over the
years I had dismissed the thought as the
impression of an overimaginative kid,
but now I’m beginning to wonder.

“Dolmetcher”: Had an idea that the
custom of bound heads was confined to
the New Hebrides and southern
Solomons, but besides “Kali’s” confirma-
tion that the custom is in vogue in the
Markham Valley (B. 28/3/’5l) I came
across an item that the Caribs also in-
dulged. In the West Indies the local
citizenry caused the Spanish invaders
grief and ignominy, for their heads—
bound in youth to give a box-like shape—
actually snapped the swords of Toledo,
if legend may be believed. In the New
Hebrides both men and women favor the
binding of the head at birth. They use
a cap made of a soft straw which fits
tightly on the child’s forehead and has a
high conical crown to allow the growth
of the head in the required direction. A
head of 19in, from chin to crown is
quite usual. The maximum I have seen
measured 22in., though even that was
by no means the record length. The
reason for this custom is obscure, though
it is probable that elongated skulls would
give greater protection against sunstroke
to people who occasionally leave the
high bush for the open reaches of the
river or reef, Though the custom is
officially prohibited in the New Hebrides
on the ground that it results in im-
becility, there appears to be no evidence
that such is the case —in fact, simple in-
telligence-tests conducted among natives
with bound and unbound heads gave a
slightly higher rating to the bound
group.

“Dave”: I see where the papers tell
that Tommy, the lighthorse draught-
house —sorry, the lighthouse draught-
horse —on Gabo Island (Vic.) died at
the age of 31, and the bloke adds
“Surely a record age for a working-
horse!” Well, that wants putting right.
Our old Dolly died at the age of 34, and
she’d worked on the farm all her life.
She pulled a light plough up to the age
of 32, and her last performance before
she got turned out for the rest of her
life was to draw 69 sled-loads of stone
up from the creek. When she got so old
that she either couldn’t lie down or was
afraid to. Dad arranged to have her
shot; but she beat him by about six
hours. Funny how a very old man seems
to grow smaller and smaller and a very
old horse gets bigger and bigger . . .
Right oh, cornin’.

“Nivlek”; Queensland brumbies are
not confined to the outer marches of the
State. Within eight miles as the crow
flies from Brisbane G.P.O. sizeable mobs,
several a hundred strong, range the pre-
cipitous and heavily timbered area known
as “The Blunder.” Though poor, inbred
specimens in the main, there are ex-
ceptions, particularly the chestnut and
taffy stallions which lead their respective
harems over a stamping-ground one
boundary of which is within a mile of a
tram terminus. The mobs, built up over
the past 30 years, are a by-product of
the mechanisation of the suburban dairy
industry, under which their progenitors
were turned loose to sire the present head-
aches to poundkeepers. Paradoxically,
there isn’t a brumby running today on
the Upper-Brisbane watershed 100 miles
to the north, a region which in the
’eighties produced a near-thoroughbred
strain from which came a legion of
winners at the first organised race-meet-
ings in Queensland, which were held at
Gayndah in the adjacent South Burnett
district. The Upper-Brisbane brumby
mobs had their genesis in the attempt of
Paddy Lennon to found a horse-station
on the slopes of the Main Range. Lennon
imported pure Arabs, many of which
went bush from his primitive yards to
mate with near-thoroughbreds from the
South Burnett squattages. Brumby-run-
ning on Baramban in the time of Isaac
Moore called together Charlie Green,
Bob Sexton, Tom Walters, Jimmy Raper
and the aboriginal centaur, Billy Barlow,
who formed what was acclaimed as the
elite school of scrub-dashers in Austra-
lia.

“Harbel”; Years ago, although there
were plenty of bandicoots in this dis-
trict, they weren’t often seen, simply be-

cause they had no need to venture from
their native scrub. Now, alas, poor
bandy is often in evidence—squashed
from the wheels of a motor-vehicle, no
doubt while he was attempting to cross
the road in search of food. As with most
nocturnal animals, headlights dazzle him,
but his appearance also contributes a lot
to his violent death. The city-bred
motorist sees a “rat” in the path laid by
the headlights and deliberately runs it
down. Bandicoots visit the local gardens
at night, now—which is fair enough,
those gardens having supplanted the
source of yams and edible roots. But
those gardeners who have come out from
more populated areas take a different
view. They hear the little animal’s
snufflings in the dark, see small holes dug
in the lawn, and promptly brand the in-
truder an enemy. Then begins the purge
programme. Fortunately, bandy is less
silly than he looks; he is not easily
poisoned, doesn’t walk blindly into traps,
and has a sturdy neck capable of break-
ing extremely strong snares. All around
me the battle is raging, but I wish I could
let the little fellows know that my place
is neutral. Sometimes I hear little grunt-
ing snuffles outside my bedroom, and
daylight showsi small excavations, but
more strength to their snozzles! Every
hole is one less nut-grass bulb.
* ♦ * ♦
“Wonk”: Struck a youth today who
wanted to know about a particularly
rough stretch of back-country, as he
intends going in there shortly. His
manner and speech spelt city, so I went
into elaborate instruction, stressing a few
salient points, and adding the hope that
he wouldn’t get himself lost. “Oh, we
won’t get lost,” he answered confidently.
“Bush-work is our line. We can always
find our way out of any place.” “Yes?”
It was interesting to meet a youth like
that these days. “Trained in it, eh?” I
mostly go by the sun myself, and a sense
of direction, though the general layout
of the country helps, too, to get a line
on one’s whereabouts. “Well, the sun
might be right enough sometimes,” he
agreed, “but often it’s cloudy. We’ve
learned to manage without it.” He was
even better than I’d thought. “Yes,
fhere are other ways,” I nodded. “There
are the trees, of course, and some coves
make a special study of the different
insects, the bark on the vegetation, and
the wind.” “Do they?” he said mildly.
“Well that hooey might do for some, but
us land blokes stick to a good compass
and our general maps; and if we get off
the marked tracks we draw up detailed
plans as we go along.”
* * * *
“Old-timer”: Permit me to work off
a resentment that has lain deep in my
sinful heart for many a year. Lately I’ve
been reading and hearing a great to-do
about the scarcity of farm- and station-
labor, which appears to have cleared out
to the cities in search of high wages,
short hours and you-needn’t-bust-your-
guts. I’d like to hear what the majority
of cockies and squatters ever did to retain
their permanent hands other than depend
on the scarcity of employment to do it.
Farm and station wages were always
low by comparison with town wages, the
hours were always longer than in towns,
the accommodation was usually primitive
and uncomfortable, the tucker nothing to
write home about. There never was any
place on the average farm or station for
ambition, improvement of the mind
or easy personal cleanliness. True,
very often the employer himself
was no more than a clod, weighed
down with debt and endless toil.
and many a thoughtful hand, aware that
he was free to go where he chose, con-
sidered himself more fortunate than his
boss. But even where the boss had the
benefit of education and was economically
secure, he would have fainted at the
notion of giving his hands better accom-
modation and more money, and did it
only when the A.W.U. forced him to,
and then only up to what the law re-
quired. There were, of course, places
where a man could expect a bonus from
the crop or some other share in a good
season, but these seldom had to seek
hands and were usually looked upon by
itinerant farm-workers as some sort of
an unattainable Mecca. Now, with
secondary industry offering big wages and
short hours and civilised living, landmen
scream to heaven against the very natural
exodus of their labor to towns and cities!
It leaves my withers unwrung.

“B. A. Ker”: A bulldozer is clearing
a patch of scrub that I knew in my
schooldays, and although the piece of
weather-rotted harness scraped up may
be a mere coincidence, it reminded me:
Thirty-odd years ago a horse-bus plied
between our tiny railway-station and out-
lying areas. It did not pay handsomely,
and the local humorist’s definition of the
difference between the pub’s lighting-
plant and Bill Mack’s bus —“One goes
by acetylene-gas, and the other by a set
o’ lean horses” —was a truthful, if
atrocious, pun. A cigarette-card gave Bill
his brainwave: “Y* know, a man wants
a team of mules,” he told my dad. “These
roads pull the insides out of a horse, but
mules well,
look, they
have ’em in
the Army for
hauling
guns 1 ” And
h e showed
Dad the card
—an action
photo en-
titled:
“Bringing Up
the Guns.”
It seemed like
another one
of his wildcat
schemes, until a drover arrived with four
queer-looking, long-eared animals. Then
the Wild West Show started. At first
Bill tried harnessing one mule with three
horses. Result: Two crippled nags. That
decided the old diehard; “I’ll put four
in together and run ’em right out.” How
he managed the harnessing was a miracle
I didn’t witness, but Hollywood’s bolting
stagecoaches have always seemed sissy
affairs to me since seeing those mules
“run out.” And the finale was the sort
of thing comedians dream of being able
to achieve —with the bus on its side, Bill
strewn across a wheel and slowly going
round with it, his “straw-biscuit” threaded
on his arm like a cuff, and four bucking,
kicking, plunging mules disappearing into
the scrub, never to be sighted again.
BLACKBIRD ON THE GRASS.
Now run a bit, then pause a while,
Then run again and wait,
Look well ahead —professional style,
Stand in a sphinx-like state.
What, nothing there? Well, off you go,
Run on ahead again.
Ssh! Stop and listen. Down below,
After the wintry rain,
The fleshy worms, long, thin and pink,
Are all snug underground.
Immune from harm (that’s what they think)
Beneath each loamy mound.
So sprint along, and stand stockstill,
Cock your pert head, your ear,
And wait in patience there until
The quarry’s somewhere near;
Now toss aside the wet, green grass,
Dig deep the dark, soft soil —
Oh, never mind if humans pass,
On with your busy toil!
Ah, there he is; pull might and main,
Heave hoi The deed is done.
You’ve dug another worm today—•
And what a juicy one!
The clouds hang low, grey is the sky,
Now falls the evening scene,
Slowly the light fades from the eye.
The soft mist cloaks the green.
Come fly, blackbird, contentedly.
From loam and grassy blade:
Chock-full of worms, up in a tree,
You’ll sit and clean your spade.
VICTORIA.

“Betcha”: Can’t agree with “B. A. Ker”
(B. 23/5/’5l) that a gun-shy dog trembles
and cringes because the report recalls
a painful memory, nor that a dog’s fear
of thunder or other noises is necessarily
linked with an episode in his past. Occa-
sionally it is undoubtedly so, but because
the theory has something in it, it is rather
overworked these days. With the majority
of gun-shy dogs, the fear is born with
them, and belonged to one or other of
their parents, just as it is with a whip-
shy animal. It isn’t the whip itself that
scares the canine. As a pup, he‘will play
delightedly with the long thong, shaking
it and pouncing on the handle, but, coax
him as you may, the first time the whip
is cracked he turns into a howling fugitive.
Most stockmen wanting a pup refuse one
with a whip-shy parent, knowing the
weakness will probably run in the line,
and the pup be incurable. Maybe that
particular fear originated in an incident
involving one of the pup’s long-forgotten
ancestors. Fear of thunder, however, is
merely fear of the inexplicable, and many
a pup I’ve had crowd my feet and stare
around puzzled on hearing it for the
first time. Most of them soon learn it

I've owned several otherwise good
workers that were not only useless during
a storm, but were a positive embarrass-
ment.

“Solitude”: “Gripes, they’re rotten
pants y’ get nowadays.” “I know, Sol,
1 know,” Seventyfiver broke in. “But they
ain’t a patch on the rotten boots. Look
at them, will y’! Jus’ look at ’em! An’
only new three weeks ago. Well, I ain’t
got no more, so I have t’ wear ’em inter
town, to take them skins in I got f’r that
city bloke.” He disappeared towards
town, and didn’t get back till well after
dark. “Y’ know that bloke,” he said
then, dropping on the box behind the
table. “He’s got a boot fact’ry in the
city.” “Yair? And did he like the
skins? How much did they make?”
“We-ell,” drawled Seventyfiver, “he did
seem t’ think they weren’t quite as good
as the last lot. But y’ see, there wus a
shower, an’ I had one foot soppin’ wet,
an’ the other speared through with a nail
in me boot, so I explained to him how
things was bad, an’ what with the high
cost o’ production—like the price o’ traps
an’ cartridges, an’ the price o’ nags an’
chaff —well, I’d be losin’ money if I didn’t
get three quid each f’r them pelts.”
“Three quid!” Seventyfiver grinned.
“Yair. He squirmed a bit,” he said
happily, “but he had t’ get them skins,
don’t y’ see, t’ match the rest of his rug.”
For a few minutes Seventyfiver turned his
attention to a shank-bone ; then: “ ’Bout
five-bob each f’r them skins be a fair
thing, d’ y’ reckon, Sol?” he queried.
“That’s what I kept out f’r meself, any-
way. Gave the rest t’ that homeless-kids
appeal they got at the post-office.
Thought it might buy the poor little
blighters some decent boots.”

“Rooster”: One often reads about the
“iridescent colors” or the “metallic
sheen” of bird-plumage. Why do these
colors have different characters? There’s
more to it than meets the eye. Some
colors (including orange, yellow, brown
and black) are not affected by changes
of illumination; plainly, non-iridescent.
The reason is simple: the pigments are
distributed through the feathers. An
example is the turacou, a native of Africa,
the red feathers of which lose their color-
ing when rain-washed. A second group
of colorings is produced by a combina-
tion of pigment with certain peculiar
surface pigmentations. Violet, blue and
green are produced in this way. As a
result, with variations of light or physical
conditions, we see “double” ; the deep-
blue feather of a parrot appears grey or
yellowish when held against the light.
Yet another group of colorings is repre-
sented by the glossy tones (“metallic”) of
the starlings, humming-birds, pheasants
and birds of paradise. Such feathers,
when viewed through the microscope,
show minutely-fine ridges and grooves or
are pin-pointed with millions of tiny
papillae, which act in the same way as
prisms, breaking up the light.

“Bo”: The rock, weighing about six
tons, quarter-way up the hill that rose
“Come off, Nero —you're on the Wrong scent!”
steeply from the back of Dolan’s four-
room wooden house, had slipped several
feet when it was undermined following
about 12in. of rain. Dolan, after long in-
spection, decided that it would be less
trouble to shift the house than the rock.
So he engaged Carter to do the job. With
the rollers under it and the team of
horses harnessed up, Dolan indicated the
new site —about 20ft. further along the
ridge. Carter registered his amazement.
“But your house won’t clear the rock
then, Ned,” he protested. “It’s opposite
the living-room now —it’ll be just about
behind the bathroom then on the opposite
side of your joint. Why not shift it right
over to the other side of your block?”
“It’s all right for you, Tom,” said Dolan.
“The longer you have to drag it the more
you’ll charge. No, this far’ll do. I use
the bathroom about ten minutes a week.
Y’ can work out for yourself the odds
against me bein’ in it if that big gooley
breaks loose again. Just park it where
I said,”

“Shadow-chaser”: The old frog with
the basso-profundo voice which took up
residence years ago under my 800-gallon
water-tank has during his occupancy
been a grand weather-prophet. I first took
heed of him when he broke his long
silence two days before the first shower
that heralded the breaking of a nine-
months drought, and every drought
since, little or big, has broken shortly
after the magician’s rumbling croak.
When the ’45 drought looked like beat-
ing all others I rejoiced to hear my old
friend again and prepared for the deluge.
But the sky remained blue, with the
batrachian maintaining his deepest notes
night and day. Concluding that he had
grown garrulous with age, I remembered
that I had never seen, only heard, my
prophet. Deciding to dig him up for
identification, I discovered that the tank
was leaking—the faithful fellow had been
deceived after all those years of stout
service.

“Blime”: Funny how you run into
blokes. First time 1 met the big curly-
headed cove I was coming down a steep
mountain-road with a heavy load on the
truck. He was hugging the bank, and as
I snaked around a corkscrew bend I
braked suddenly and stopped a foot off
his big shining sedan. There was no room
to pass, and I climbed out. “W-what’ll
we do?” was his greeting. “Have to
back,” I replied. “Let your car run back
round that last bend and edge into the
scrub in the next gully.” "Me!” he
gasped. “N-no, I couldn’t. Honest.” He
walked to the side of the road and peeped
gingerly over. “Gosh, it must be all of
two-hundred feet down there.” “About
that,” I agreed. “But, look here, there’s
no place above for me to get into. Mind
if I run your car back?” He followed
me, yelling nervous instructions as 1
backed his car down the mountain-side.
A few weeks later an urgent call sent me
to the metropolis in my old tourer. In
the heart of the city I crept between
trucks and buses, in a pandemonium of
noise that paralysed rational thought. I
missed dozens of pedestrians—don’t ask
me how—and got stuck in the middle of
nightmares. Out of the din someone
called, and at the next-corner red lights
a sedan slid alongside me to a stop. “No
big precipices round here,” came the same
voice ; then the curly-headed cove grinned
at me. As we moved off he shot through
an impossible opening, ran under the
/ bonnet of a great overhanging bus, and
was soon lost in the maelstrom.

“C.S.”: If you haven’t already seen
the “J. D. Wilton Wonder Horse, Rodeo
Show, and Circus,” the proprietor hopes
you will. Wilton has broken in horses
on no fewer than 58 Queensland stations
and studs, and has compiled the know-
ledge and experience of many years in
a useful handbook, “Breaking of the
Saddle-Horse by Training.” This doesn’t
mean what it says, for Wilton’s method is
not to break the horse but to make him a
tractable and docile friend full of strength
and spirit. No better treatise on the
handling and training of young horses
for hacks, station-work and racing has
appeared locally. A true horseman, the
owner has written something badly-
needed in these times, when the breaking-
in of saddle-horses is almost a lost art.
He’s at 74 Pacific Highway, Waitara
(N.S.W.).

“Kali”: Had a letter from a friend in
New Guinea saying that every nut on
his coconut plantation had fallen after
only about three-weeks’ growth. The
Malay would have a very good explana-
tion for this defection, for Malayan tradi-
tion ordains that the nuts must be planted
according to age-old ritual; any devia-
tion from these rules would result in the
nuts falling months before maturity.
According to Ahmat, the holes for the
sprouting nuts must be dug in the early
morning and left unattended for three
days, the period being spent in devotion
by incantations to the earth-spirits. At
the conclusion of these rites strong medi-
cine must be placed in each hole, this
invariably consisting of two leaves from
the coconut-palm, a small piece cut from
the anatomy of a wild boar, and a
powdered bailer-shell. After further
appeals to the earth-spirits the nut is cere-
moniously planted and the good holy
earth scooped over it. The nut will soon
sprout strongly, grow straight and tall
and soon bear good fruit. A more mun-
dane explanation of the failure of the
N.G. plantation might possibly be an
excess of rain, followed by a very pro-
tracted hot spell.

“E.H.S.”: One of the fraternity fishing
the Broken River, near Benalla (Vic.),
was so long waiting for a bite he was
beginning to wonder if the stream was
fished out, when he became aware of
another angler a short distance upstream
pulling them out almost as fast as he
could take them
off the hook. He
moved toward the
stranger and con-
tinued fishing, but
with no better
success. At last,
overcome b y
curiosity, he
approached and
inquired what
bait he was using.
“Me, I usa da
spaghet’,” replied
his fellow-fisher-
man as he re-
moved a three-
pounder from the hook. “Oh, yes; da
frog, da grub, da worm, he catcha da
feesh some-a da time, but da spaghet’
catcha heem alia da time.” Then he
handed the local man a fistful of the
mushy fodder of Italy with the remark
“You try.” He tried, and the fish came
at that bait with such enthusiasm that he
closed the day with a fine assortment
of yellowbellies, silver-perch, catfish and
small Murray cod.
EREMOPHILA.
These trees with desert-varnished leaves
Now can never be
Strangers again to me.
Here where the curlew grieves,
Burdened with legend and
The fears of man, the sand
Blows red on legendary
Rock-holes that no men know.
But still the same winds blow
Through twisted boughs; the ancient brand
Of root bites in the stone;
Rock-bound, standing alone,
The desert-loving very slowly grow.
And I who watch here know they who are gone
And had no name for beauty needed none.

The big life offices —they are a tower
of strength in our economic and social
structure —had another record year in
1950. Behind the buoyancy lie the in-
flationary boom, a rapidly expanding
population, quick growth of industrial
superannuation schemes, homes-pur-
chases associated with life cover and the
security aspect of assurance. A life policy
with a sound regular-bonus-paying
office creates an immediate estate with a
full measure of capital security long
before it is ever paid for, an advantage
for which there is no substitute.
The 101-year-old A.M.P., biggest mutual
life office in the British Commonwealth,
has made more progress over the last
decade than during the previous 91 years:
1930. 1940. 1950.

The future of the society is built largely
upon new business, which increased by
£7,337,895 last year—B9.7 p.c. of it
(£69,161,795, up £7,615,186) was ordinary
and 10.3 p.c. (£7,930,627, down £277,291)
industrial. In common with other life
offices the co. shortened sail in the in-
dustrial field, where collection of
premiums is a weekly door-to-door affair,
which has become very expensive with
the steep rise in wage-rates. To keep
costs down, and so protect the interests
of policyholders, the number of agents
operating in this field has been reduced,
with an inevitable contraction in the
amount of ne\y business written.
After deducting taxes (£500,169), the
year’s income from all sources was
£2,612,676 stronger at £29,103,186 —
£21,745,661 (up £1,673,312) premiums,
etc., £7,277,302 (up £552,966) interest,
divs., etc., and £80,223 (down £63,602)
surplus on sale of assets. Claims were
well within actuarial expectation, a tight
control was kept upon exes, and £100,545
was written off the book-value of
premises and other assets. Of the
£14,028,775 that remained, £500,000 was
used to further strengthen the visible
reserve for contingencies (now
£5,000,000), and the balance (£13,528,775)
was added to the life funds, raising them
to £197,578,283.
These funds alone are well in excess of
actuarial liabilities under policies, calcu-
lated on a stringent all-round 2\ p.c. basis,
thus leaving a substantial sum for distri-
bution as bonuses among policyholders.
Here are the figures for the 0.D.:
1949. 1950.
Assurance funds .. £162,965,713 £174,188,182
Actuarial liability .. 158,380,173 169,308,685
Surplus .. .. £4,585,540 £4,879,497
Bonus policyholders .. 4,228,302 4,556,030
Eeserve interim bonuses 40,000 50,000
Carried forward .. .. 317,238 273,467
Though bonus-rates were on
an even keel, actual amounts received by
policyholders increased slightly, owing
to the compound reversionary basis on
which bonuses are calculated. Rates on
O.D. whole-life policies ranged from
31s. p.c. on contracts one year in force
to 645. p.c. on those 40 years old or
more —a very satisfactory scale.
And the entire undertaking was handled
at less cost, despite the large amount of
new' business and rise in the wage-rates.
In the O.D. exes, took 15.7 p.c. of
premiums as against 16 p.c. in 1949. In
the ID. the rates were 22.9 p.c. and 23.4
p.c. respectively. Behind the improve-
ment lie increased efficiency and
mechanisation of routine accounting
processes.
Another pleasing feature was arrest of
the long drift (a common experience) in
the net rate of interest earned on the
assurance funds —£3 11s. 9d. p.c. (up Is.
p.c.), after deducting taxes. The margin
between this rate and that assumed in
valuing policy liabilities is slightly more
than is usually considered adequate for
maintenance of current bonus-rates.
Since bonuses are the result of wise
investment as well as efficient manage-
ment, more attention is being given to
mortgage, equity and other industrial
securities, which show a better net return
than Government paper;

Of last year’s net growth of £14,821,431
in total assets, £13,421,428 was in respect
of mortgages and £1,372,319 shares and
debentures. The co. is thus playing an
important part in relieving the tragic
housing situation. Most of the increase
in shareholdings, etc,, was in pref. shares
and debentures. Good progress is re-
ported with the co.’s land development
project, Coonalpyn Downs (S. Aus.),
where some 16,500 acres are now in use
as an experimental area.

Those on the ord. register at June 23,
1950, were rewarded with a three-for-10
bonus-scrip issue. It called for £150,000,
which was provided from a surplus on
revaluation of land and buildings in Aus-
tralia (£125,241) and New Zealand
(£24,759). Paid capital, steady at £600,000
for the preceding 30 years, thus became
£750,000 in f.-p, ss. shares, of which
400,000 are 8 p.c. cum. prefs. and the
balance ords. Then, at the end of October
last, the N.Z. section of the business was
passed to a subsidiary, Gordon and Gotch
(N.Z.), Ltd., and the holding in sub-
sidiaries increased by £282,477. This was
purely a domestic arrangement intended
to iron-out some problems of adminis-
tration and finance.
There is nothing to suggest that the
gift-giving was overdone. Properties still
appear in the books well below their
market value. The co. is well entrenched
throughout Australia and New Zealand
in the advertising and wholesale news-
agency business, and is a large importer
of newsprint and printing machinery as
well as periodicals, books, stationery and
fancy-goods, etc. Ever since it took over
the old Gordon and Gotch businesses
31 years ago, the board has financed
expansion mostly out of surplus earnings,
which has enabled the co. to gather some
rich harvests from the post-war boom.
The slip in the 1950 profit was more
than covered by increased allowance for
depreciation. Turnover has gone from
record to record, the improvement being
over £1,000,000 last term, when the gain
in gross earnings (up £172,873) exceeded
the growth in exes, (up £153,137) by
£19,736:

ings of parent and subsidiaries was
£198,126, which covered the pref. div.
and 29.2 p.c. on ord. capital as it now
stands as against 28.8, 30.8, 30.1, 24.5
and 19.6 p.c. back to 1946.

Book debts .. 796,149 624,721 730,762 814,951
The year’s movements in freeholds, plant,
etc., shares in subsidiaries, stocks and
book debts, reflect the revaluation of
properties, formation of the N.Z. off-
shoot, rising prices and expanding trade.
Stocks appear at or below cost, and prices,
especially for newsprint, have continued
to climb since the books were ruled off.
The book-value of net assets in the sub-
sidiaries exceeds the figure at which the
shares appear in the parent’s accounts by
over £95,000.
The chairman points out that while
some sections of such a widespread busi-
ness may at times cause concern, others
do not. The troublesome section at the
moment is magazines and periodicals,
owing to the shrinkage of margins be-
tween selling-prices and handling costs.
These margins are now so fine that any
marked falling-off of turnover could have
“a very adverse effect on trading results.”
However, all things considered, the board
“looks to the future with reasonable con-
fidence.”
The market likes the way the business
is shaping and expresses its confidence
in the management by pricing the ords. at
28s. (245. 6d. a year ago), giving an im-
mediate return of 3.5 p.c. on a 20 p.c.
div. basis. The prefs. at 10s. yield 4 p.c.
Both classes of scrip rank equally for
capital, net tangible cover (parent’s and
subsidiaries’ figures combined) being
9s. Bd. per share.

The buoyancy of earnings, lift in the div.
and disclosure of inner reserves heartened
the market, which has become apprehen-
sive of the impact of inflation upon the
real value of capital.* The price of the
f.-p. £1 shares, which had advanced from
595. 6d. at end June, 1950, to 82s. a
month or so ago, shot up to 86s. 6d.
following publication of the accounts.
Other basic factors influencing the
market’s assessment of the scrip are the
pleasing history of the business and its
strong position financially and otherwise.
The immediate return at 86s. 6d. is
2.9 p.c, on a 12i p.c. div. basis. The
investor who looks for approximately
4 p.c. on his money counts on a 17 p.c.
div. or other benefits, such as a one-for-
two issue of bonus-scrip and drop in the
div. to 11 p.c., which would then call
for £15,449 more profit than was claimed
last term. Visible net tangible cover is
545. 4d. per share.
The co. handles all kinds of paper and
printers’ requisites, has Commonwealth-
wide connections, and a subsidiary in
London looks after the buying end of
the business. Shareholders got a steady
10 p.c., sweetened with £50,000 of bonus
scrip, for the 15 years to 1930; the
rate dropped to 5f p.c. for the next two
slump years, climbed to 10 p.c. again in
1939 and remained steady till 1949, then
rose to Hi p.c. and to 12i p.c. last term.
During 1932-34 £368,484 of capital was
returned. ,To help finance post-war ex-
pansion 75,193 new £1 ords. were issued
at a premium of 295. each in Dec., 1947,
followed by a further 100,000 at a pre-
mium of 20s. each in March, 1949. The
premiums make 12i p.c. worth only 5.7
p.c. on the last £175,193 of capital.
Last term supplies of all grades of
paper, especially newsprint, became pro-
gressively tighter and dearer. At the
moment there is an extreme shortage,
and prices are at record levels —over twice
the figure of a year ago for newsprint.
For distributors this has been a “bull”
point, but for publishers it has meant
smaller newspapers and periodicals and
a sharp contraction in profits. How-
ever, recent cable advice from Scan-
dinavian mills suggest that paper
prices have reached their peak,
chairman W. P. Dunlop says. The
printing-machinery and all other sections
of the business contributed to the
year’s record turnover. Declared profit
was £11,038 stronger at £75,492, equal to
13.7 p.c. on capital as against 11.7, 11.3,
12.2, 10.8 and 10.5 p.c. back to 1946.
But that isn’t all the story. After
making “full” provision for taxation, the
year’s expenditure on fixtures, trucks, etc.
(£16,678), was written off out of earn-
ings, the “substantial” reserve for new
cars and trucks was further strengthened,
“an amount was laid aside for extra
wages,” and provision made for further
contributions to the employees’ provident
fund during the current year and in 1952.
This last-mentioned provision is included
in an unexplained addition of £199,438
to reserves, which also included “various
items” previously lumped with creditors,
etc,, in the published accounts.
Expansion is the feature of balance-
sheet figures:

The growth in creditors, etc., is largely in
respect of bills payable on overseas ship-
ments (£496,484, up £342,139). Among
other things, this is a hedge against pos-
sible appreciation of the Australian pound.
Stocks (up £268,125) appear at the lower
of cost or replacement less reserves, and
book debts (up £296,669) are adequately
protected by securities and/or reserves.
Freeholds (up £51,959) reflect purchase of
properties in Brisbane and Perth. The
more-or-less liquid surplus (£1,338,237)
was £167,076 stronger, due mainly to dis-
closure of inner reserves.

• After eliminating outside shareholders’
interests.
Since the public became in-
terested in 1939, when a par
issue of 40,000 £1 ords. lifted
issued capital to £BO,OOO, the
business has enjoyed a sheltered
market and has expanded rapidly
under the influence of post-war
inflationary conditions. Paid
capital, which had grown to
£150,589 in 1945, shot up to
£507,521 at end Dec., 1950, the
last £243,173 being gathered
during the 12 months covered
by the latest accounts. Also,
£lOO,OOO of 4 p.c. debenture
money was got in during 1948.
And profitable employment was
quickly found for these new
fuqds and more besides.
Earnings, sluggish during the
war years, have stepped along in
fine style since. Turnover in-
creased by 30 p.c. last term.
After eliminating outside share-
holders’ interests and allowing
an extra £8574 for depreciation
(£41,563) and an additional
£7338 for taxation (£35,000), the
net result was £26,383 stronger
at £70,916 —a heartening achieve-
ment considering the sharp rise
in operating costs, shortage of
raw materials, much of which is
imported, high labor turnover
and consequent heavy outlay on
training new personnel —this
exceeded the amount paid in
dividends last year. The £70,916
of profit covered pref. require-
ments and 29.1 p.c. on average
ord. capital as against 24.9, 19.9
and 29.5 p.c. for the three pre-
ceding years. The div. was lifted
from 12 p.c. to 14 p.c., making
the average 9.3 p.c. for the last
dozen years. The £160,615 of
reserves includes £51,736 of
share premiums, which, of
course, takes a little of the gilt
off the gingerbread.
Output of the main factories
at Richmond (Vic.) and of three
operating subsidiaries is marketed
by distributing offshoots in all
States, Chief products are
plastic-covered wires and cables,
plastic electrical fittings, insula-
tion sheeting, radio cabinets,
mouldings, garden hose and
other flexible plastic products,
including plastic-coated fabrics.
Some of the technical staff
recently visited the U.K., Canada
and U.S., and a number of new
products are soon to be manu-
factured and marketed.
The year’s fresh share capital,
together with surplus earnings
and an extra £226,844 from
creditors, etc., went mainly into
stocks (up £356,419) and book
debts (up £52,334):

The net growth in fixed assets
was £85,631.
To lighten the debt and pro-
vide for further expansion, those
on the ord. register at June 6
were offered 655,000 new ss.
ords. at a premium of 2s, 6d.
each, one for two. Simultane-
ously B pref. holders were
offered 84,375 new £1 B 5 p.c.
prefs. at par, one for two. The
combined issues will lift paid
capital to £766,875 in 20,000 A
6-8 p.c, and 253,125 B 5 p.c,
prefs., all of £1 each, and
1.975.000 ss. ords. Pref. divs.
and 14 p.c. to the ords. will then
call for £83,381, or £12,465 more
profit than was shown last term.
The market sees no cloud in
the co.’s sky at the moment.
Still, as time advances compe-
tition from both local and over-
seas sources, including Japan,
can be expected to sharpen. The
ords. at 20s. return 3.5 p.c. on
a 14 p.c. div, basis. The rights
recently sold at 125., making f.-p.
cost 19s. 6d. The A prefs. at
30s. 6d. and B’s at 225. 6d. yield
5.2 p.c. and 4.5 p.c. respectively.
Including the new issue, net
tangible cover is £5O 9s. 4d. A’s,
£3 18s. 2d. B’s and 7s. sd. ords.
Large quantities of zinc con-
centrates have accumulated at
Mt. Isa (Q.), owing to shortage
of shipping. To relieve the posi-
tion the co. has chartered two
overseas vessels, which will
begin lifting the stuff for the
Antwerp market immediately.
The co.’s £2,000,000 new copper
smelter is not expected to get
into action until next year. It
is scheduled to treat about
36.000 tons of 4 p.c. copper ore
a. month, and the annual output
of blister, to be sold on the local
market, is expected to approxi-
mate 18,000 tons. Since the be-
ginning of 1951 the co.’s pound
shares have advanced from
435. 6d. to 595. 6d. in the
market, due mainly to the
strengthening of metal prices.
For the year to June 30, 1950,
15 p.c. was paid from profits
equal to 17.9 p.c. on capital. For
the current term an interim 3s. a
share was sent out in Dec. last.

Hill 50, at Mt. Magnet, on the
Murchison field (W.A.), began
crushing again a couple of
months ago, but it will be
a while yet before maximum
throughput is reached be-
cause underground develop-
ment is not sufficiently
advanced. The mill shut down
toward the close of 1950, when
available ore cut out, and
the new main shaft, sunk to over
940 ft., was not ready for haul-
age. There is reckoned to be
200,000 short tons, averaging
s*dwt, between the 400 ft. and

confirmed continuation of the

Assets and Profits
Recent happenings in the Aus-
tralian industrial field make one
wonder whether we are making
much real present progress to-
wards overcoming our economic
shortages or whether all that we
have been planning for is in the
blueprint, or at least only partly-
completed, stage. The cut in
supplies of zinc has been only
one item; nearly all metals are
scarce, and the building trade is
chronically up against it for
supplies of nearly every material.
It is much the same with
chemicals. Sulphur and sul-
phuric acid are exceptionally
scarce. And many forms of
Australian production are being
held up by the lack of essential
materials from overseas. This
partly arises from the defence
programmes of Britain and the
U.S.A., and partly from post-
war world economic and poli-
tical strain.
Of course, the chief problem
in Australia at present is that of
getting enough coal. That is the
reason for the shortage of very
many things, especially steel. It
is not, perhaps, the reason for
the scarcity of cement in N. S.
Wales, but it is at the root of a
great variety of our shortages
of essential raw materials.
It is going to be a major poli-
tical and industrial job to in-
crease coal output to the neces-
sary extent, but it is a domestic
problem that should be capable
of solution by ourselves. The
current session of Parliament
will have a vital bearing on what
is to happen in this regard over
the next few years.
Machinery and plant to a very
high value have been pouring
into Australia. A great deal of
new capital has been raised by
industry—far and away a record
amount—over the past four
years. But it would be interest-
ing to know the proportion the
actual volume, horse-power or
other capacity of machinery im-
ports bears to normal imports,
and the extent to which these
imports are replacements rather
than additions to existing factory
plant capacity.
This aspect of things has its
bearing on capital increments
of many public companies within
the past few years. The infla-
tion of share-registers does not
necessarily mean that plant
capacity has increased in similar
proportion. Taking into account
depreciation on old plant and
the future cost of replacement,
many concerns have probably
done little more than maintain
their place.
The broad field of industrial
activity ahead of Australia is an
attractive one provided we can
overcome coal and other short-
ages of essential raw materials,
and at the same time raise out-
put per man-hour generally. But
we must not forget at any stage
that real progress depends on
greater productivity, and not
upon the inflationary conditions
that fog up the whole economic
prospect and create pleasant
mirages among investors as well
dire confusion among those try-
ing to run industry.
At the present time there is a
great rush to invest in new com-
panies that are seeking Stock Ex-
change listing. In many cases
the desire to get into these con-
cerns is perfectly sound. But
there are two very different fac-
tors to be considered about
these new investments ; they are
the Stock Exchange factor (often
a gambling rather than an in-
vestment one) and the real in-
dustrial and economic factor. In
other words, it is not wise to buy
shares merely because others
want to buy them and perhaps
create false Stock Exchange
values. The only safe way to
invest is to study the actual in-
dustrial problems and prospects
of the investment company con-
cerned.
The person who is on safest
ground in buying shares today is
the one who understands the in-
flation problem in all its aspects,
and who, after considering these
“Purdy speaking —yes, fire away!”
aspects, decides that he is pre-
pared for lengthy holding purely
as a protection of the buying-
power of his investment. If he
studies the position closely he
will realise that whilst, in general,
industrial equities even at pre-
sent average prices do offer him
prospects of such protection, the
inflationary factor affects costs
as well as capital values, and
that the worth of capital assets
as working assets depends upon
whether profit-percentage mar-
gins on the working of those
assets can be maintained.
Patons and 1 Baldwins
When the prospectus of
Patons and Baldwins (Aust.),
Ltd., is put out early in July its
issue of both ordinary and 5 p.c.
prefs. is bound to be rushed.
Already most brokers have a
long waiting-list for the shares
regardless of whether they are
going to receive any or not.
Public issues will be 500,000
£1 ords, and 750,000 5 p.c. £1
prefs., both lots at par. The
net purchase consideration pay-
able to Patons and Baldwins,
Ltd., of England, will be
£3,879,016, to be satisfied partly
by the issue of 1,000,000 fully-
paid £1 ords. and partly by a
payment in cash of £1,200,000,
which will be more than covered
by the public issue. The balance
of the consideration is to remain
on loan account between the
two cos.
The parent’s woollen and
worsted yarns have a world-
wide reputation. The Australian
factory is at Launceston (Tas.).
Latest adjusted profit of the
Australian section of the busi-
ness is for the year to April 30
last, and it amounts to £278,630,
after tax, compared with
£198,472 for 1949-50 and
£162,481 for 1948-49. The
1950-51 result was equal to a
shade over 16 p.c. on proposed
ord. capital, allowing for the
prefs.; that for 1949-50, 10.7
p.c.; 1948-49, 8.3 p.c.
Even assuming a conservative
dividend policy, the ords. at par,
on the incomplete figures so far
published, look unusually
attractive. Asset backing for
the shares will not be known
until the prospectus is available.
Underwriters of the public
issue are Anglo-Australian Cor-
poration Pty., Ltd., and brokers
are Wm. Noall and Son, of Mel-
bourne, Some brokers in other
States will handle parcels of the
shares, but half a million ords.
won’t go very far in the present
state of mind of the share-
market.
Associated Pulp and Paper
Associated Pulp and Paper
Mills, Ltd., which at present
operates four paper - making
machines at Burnie (Tas.), has
decided to erect a paper-mill of
15,000 tons p.a, capacity at
Geelong (Vic.), where a site has
already been purchased.
This mill will initially carry
twin machines 120 in. wide, and
will manufacture writing-papers.
It will be in operation in 1954-
55, subject, of course, to delivery
of plant and materials.
The paper-mill will be backed
up by a pulp-mill located in the
vicinity of the Otway forests.
This pulp-mill, which it is
intended to operate on a very
new continuous pulping process,
will be capable of treating not
only eucalypt timbers —on which
the Burnie mill is based —but
also pine from the plantations
in the immediate vicinity. It is
hoped that the presence of a
pulp-mill capable of handling
this class of timber will act as
an incentive towards extra plant-
ings. The pulp-mill will be
brought into production as soon
as practicable after the paper-
mill. Total capital investment
involved will be upwards of
£4,000,000.
It is anticipated that the ex-
panded Burnie mill —the No. 4
machine is almost ready to come
into production—and the new
mill will broadly cover Aus-
tralia’s requirements of fine
papers until about 1960. By
that time, on the present basis
of computation, it will be neces-
sary for further capacity to be
installed. Planning to this end
is already in hand.
Associated Pulp has also
acquired the whole of the share-
holding in Thomas Owen and
Co. (Australia), Ltd., held by the
English Thomas Owen Co., the
consideration being the allot-
ment to the English co. by way
of exchange of “a substantial
number” of ord. shares in
A.P. and P. and an option in
favor of the English co. to
subscribe for a “further sub-
stantial number” of ords.
The Australian Owen co. is
erecting a mill at Burnie to make
parchment, greaseproof and
other special papers, and it has
an issued capital of £1,750,000 —
£750,000 in publicly-»held 4j p.c.
prefs. and a million partly-paid
ords,, taken originally in equal
parcels by the English co. and
A.P. and P.
The delivery in Australia of
a third paper-machine by the
English co. is expected within a
few months. The English co.
will continue to provide Thomas
Owen and Co. (Australia), Ltd.,
with necessary technical assist-
ance in connection with the pro-
duction of the specialty papers.
Associated Pulp is to issue
1,716,845 shares of £1 each at
par to provide the funds

Last week Associated Pulp
and Paper ords. rose 4s. 9d., to
435. 6d., but later they dropped
to 425. 3d. Last ord. div. was
6 p.c. The co. is not now subject
to price-control.
High Cost of Strikes
whi i e Maorilanders were still
r Maorilanders were still
reeling under the blow of the
50 p.c surcharge on freight-
rates as a strike penalty from
May’?, the shipowners dropped
another bombshell on shippers
by warni™ the T of new
standard c£go rates to come
after the surcharge. At the time
New Zealand’s new order on the
waterfront was speeeding up
cargoes by 60 p£ compared
with the performance of the old
deregistered unionists, and N.Z.
was rather proud of ’the way it
was rising from its three-month
strike, but there was no sign
that the shipping cos. hid
noticed the change or were pre-
pared to make any allowance for
it. This left Maorilanders with
the impression that they were
being doubly exploited, and
was a damper to their post-
strike ardor, while they were
waiting for the first shipments
of surcharged goods from John
Bull.
To consumers, primed to ex-
pect a tidal-wave of superinfla-
tion, with the surcharge and
rises on delayed goods all com-
ing together, this was like wait-
ing to serve a penal sentence.
The wave will hit them in full
force in the spring, when new
goods in volume are sold over
the counters, and it’s then that
the real music will begin. Be-
fore the disturbance is over
they’ll find themselves elevated
to chilly heights under the new
standard cargo rates now being
hatched out.
Here are some of the effects
Maorilanders can look for un-
less a miracle happens to save
them from the storm ahead.
Importers and traders, who
have to “cough up” first, might
soften price contrasts for a while
by spreading the freight levy as
widely as they can over all
goods, so far as rather rigid
price-controls will allow, and
the new plateau of prices will
be approached by steps, not at
one bound; but once that lofty
plane is reached the odds are
that Maorilanders will have to
stay up there for an uncomfort-
ably long time.
What with taxes, wage rises
and soaring overheads, the
snowballing trend will be hard
enough to rein in, let alone re-
verse. As turnovers can’t go on
mounting when domestic
budgets are under growing
strain, but are likely to slip a
notch or two, it’s no use look-
ing for help in that direction ;
business heads can’t hold out
prospects of absorbing the in-
creases that are on the way.
In the long run, manu-
facturers might fare best, be-
cause any move that knocks im-
ports must play into their hands,
and higher freight-rates are as
good as a rise in the tariff wall,
but M.L.’s narrow range of raw
materials sets limits. Those on
the box-seat, but for the man-
power handicap, are users of
wool, leather, timber products
and a short list of other items
where Maoriland is self-sup-
porting. In time labor should
gravitate in these directions.
The Dominion can’t afford the
luxury of shipping bulky wool
to John Bull to be made up into
carpets, rugs and blankets,
which, in turn, are shipped
back 12,000 miles, with fancy
freight-rates both ways, while
valuable plant in its own
woollen mills and textile
factories is used for only eight
hours a day, five days a week,
and some is lying idle.
If this sort of thing was all
right in the past it won’t do in
the brave new world that
Maorilanders are trying to
build for themselves, to support
their costly Welfare State. The
old childlike faith in a simple,
easygoing economy is being
sorely tried as M.L.’s prosperity
is buffeted from a variety of
angles, and it’s not surprising
that the women have now joined
in the growing chorus of de-
mands for a change. This is
what they say: “The rising cost
of living is making the lot .of
already harrassed housewives
almost unbearably difficult, and
we’re thoroughly tired of the
cry, ‘maximum pay for
minimum work.’ ” They’ll say
this with even more vehemence
before this year is out.
Sir Alfred Davidson, as chair-
man of Vanguard Insurance,
gave shareholders at the co.’s
statutory meeting much the
same advice as was tendered
here in B. 23/5/’5l. He said
large dividends could not be ex-
pected during the early years of
operations ; it was necessary to
build up large reserves, and re-
serves must increase in propor-
tion to the volume of business
accepted. A satisfactory flow of
business had been underwritten
since underwriting started early
in May. Vanguard has a paid
capital of £250,000 in ss. shares.
They have been bought eagerly
on the market, the price rising to
over 12s. There was a weaken-
ing to around 11s. on Friday


Women’s Letters
From Sydney
Since September last year the Red
Cross has sent 57 tons of comforts to
sick and wounded soldiers in Korea, and
branch members throughout the State
have been busy making woollen
cardigans, pullovers, etc., to be sent to
the battlefront. Those of us who heard
the account given during the week of
the bitterly cold conditions in Korea must
feel very selfish if we are not giving any
sort of support to this work.
Even the most socially competent
people find it hard to cope with all the
things one has to juggle at a cocktail-
party. Just how one is to look poised
and elegant while managing a handbag, a
pair of gloves, a glass, a cigarette, a fork,
a plate and a sausage-roll with only one
pair of hands is a major problem. Guests
at a musicale held at David Jones’ in aid
of the Golden Fleece Kindergarten during
the week were shown a plastic plate
divided into compartments which might
do something to help, if the handbag can
be slung on the arm and the gloves clipped
to it. The only other solution is to
decline all offers of food and drink at
these parties, which is good for the peace
of mind and the figure, but discouraging
to the hostess and the party spirit.
It just depends on how your luck’s
running! Both the Lady Mayoress and
Mrs. C. M, Guiney donated £5 to the doll
competition at the recent Children’s
Party, and although the Lady Mayoress
didn’t win any, Mrs. Guiney won three.
These are to be competed for again in
aid of the 2SM children who did such
a lot for the party. Plans for the Lady
Mayoress’s Ball, scheduled for September
27, are running along smoothly. It’s a
long way to look ahead, but it should be
worth waiting for.
News has come from America of the
success of a young Australian painter who
went there as a war-bride in 1946. She
is Sylvia Patricelli, daughter of Mr. L,
J. Davis, of Orange. Sylvia held her first
exhibition in Australia in 1941, when Lady
Gowrie encouraged her to show the 80
canvases she had painted of scenes in
the Guadalcanal jungles. She has con-
tinued her painting since she went to
America, and lately her exhibition in
Hartford, Connecticut, was opened by
Eleanor Roosevelt, who made the long
journey from New York especially to help
the young Australian. There were over
500 people present at the exhibition, and
Sylvia’s little daughter Susan presented a
bouquet to Mrs. Roosevelt. Sylvia’s
husband, Anthony Patricelli, writes to say
that the two Australians best known in
America are his wife and Sister Kenny.
The musicale and art exhibition held
at the Woollahra home of Mr, and Mrs.
C. T, Lorenz will benefit the National
Opera Fund by a couple of hundred
pounds, which may or may not be sur-
prising, as the tickets were five guineas
each. However, this did entitle the guests
to win an oil painting for themselves if
they were lucky, and also to hear a con-
cert from some of Sydney’s most
talented operatic singers. (It also in-
cluded, by the way, the very luscious
supper Mrs. Lorenz had prepared).
Ronald Dowd sang with a great deal of
ingratiating gusto, Clive Way with an
almost reproving primness. The other
artists were Noel Melvin, Angelina
Arena, Cathleen O’Carroll, Florence
Taylor, John Dudley and Patricia Baird.
The guests were also treated to a song
by Mr. Saligaros, the Greek singer at
present visiting these parts.
It shouldn’t be hard, by the way, to
remember the date of the Opera Ball,
which is to be held in the Town Hall on
Friday, July 13.
Having gazed with dismay at blankets
costing £2O a pair in the shops for some
time, this Letter, and maiiy other people,
spent some time during the week gazing
with fascinated admiration and envy at
the sheep show. Certainly no one should
ever use the phrase “silly as a sheep”
again.
The Americans, with their mania for
surveys, Gallup polls, etc., have found
out that 64 p.c. of American women own
a tailored or dressmaker suit, and that of
these 85 p.c. are made of wool. The
way things are going it looks as though
a wool suit will shortly bestow as much
prestige on the wearer as a mink coat.
The survey also showed that the first
thing a man notices about a woman’s suit
is whether it flatters her figure or not.
Well, it didn’t need a nation-wide survey
to tell us that.
Mrs. Allen Williams and Mrs. Norman
Jenkyn will hostess the next ladies “at-
home” of the Royal Empire Society.
This will take place on Wednesday, June
20, at 2.30 p.m., and the guests-of-honor
will be Elizabeth Northcott and Mrs.
Donald Smith.
The N.S.W, Institution for the Deaf,
Dumb and Blind launched an appeal
during the week for funds to build a
nursery school for blind children and a
training haven for little ones who are
deaf and dumb and blind. A film,
“Heritage Regained,” was shown which
demonstrated the newest methods of
bringing sight, hearing and speech to
these children. Its message was so potent
that contributions’were readily offered
from people present. There are many
thousands of pounds still to be raised,
and contributions may be sent in to the
institution. Donations over £l, inci-
dentally, are subject to rebates of
taxation.
This week’s picture is of Matron Rita
Malcolm, a distinguished member of the
nursing profession who yesterday re-
ceived the Florence Nightingale Medal for
having rendered exceptional service for
the sick. Matron Malcolm is in charge
of the Malahide Red Cross T.B. Hospital,
Pennant Hills, with which she has been
associated for 21 years. The medal was
presented to her by Sir John Newman-
Morris, president of the Australian Red
Cross Society, after the national executive
meeting held yesterday.
Another interesting Red Cross function
during the week was the farewell party
given to Christine Ng Yew Peck, of Singa-
pore, and Miss Chan Peng Chin, of
Kuala Lumpur, two young Chinese nurses
who have been studying in Australia for
the past two years. Their work at the
Children’s Hospital of Tresillian, bush-
nursing, district nursing and the
Kindergarten Union methods was spon-
sored by a scholarship established as a
memorial to the Australians who died in
Malaya and in gratitude to the Chinese
people of Malaya who offered so much
help Jo our soldiers there during the war.
This scholarship was founded by dona-
tions from men of the Bth Division and a
subsidy from the Red Cross. This is the
second couple of nurses who have com-
pleted the scholarship work. Another
girl is now studying in Melbourne, and
next year two more will go to Perth.
One of the nicest visitors we have had
to these shores during this Jubilee year
is Dr. Clara Stewart, 0.8. E., M. 8., who
is vice-chairman of the National
Marriage Guidance Council of Great
Britain, and who gave a lecture in Sydney
last week. Dr. Stewart says that marriage-
guidance should be primarily a matter
of education so that young couples start
off with a better chance of success. When
things begin to look a bit rocky, the
councils can offer first-aid, finding the
real cause of the differences (often what
a couple think is a medical disability is
found to be purely psychological), and
advising on die best cause of action.
What the council calls “ambulance work”
comes only after a smash. It can often
be successful, but it is better, Dr. Stewart
says, if it is averted. The councillors do
this work in England in a voluntary
capacity and in their spare-time, although
the central executive in London is sub-
sidised by the Government. Dr. Stewart
(who is a doctor of medicine) has been
for some years honorary-secretary of the
Leeds M.G.C. She is travelling all round
Australia with her husband, Professor
Matthew Stewart.
From Melbourne
The pomp and pageantry of the Troop-
ing of the Color in honor of the King’s
birthday was carried through by the Vic-
torian Scottish Regiment with admirable
snap and precision, the Governor, Sir
Dallas Brooks, taking the salute. Among
the State Government’s official guests
were Sir Edmund and Lady Herring ; the
Speaker of the House, Archie Michaelis
and Mrs. Michaelis, who topped her black
Persian-lamb coat with a platter-hat which
had ice-blue ribbon-trimmings; Air
Vice-Marshal Eric Hewitt and Mrs.
Hewitt, she in navy suit and matching
hat finished with velvet trimmings; Col.
Rufus Ramey, U,S. Military Attache, and
Mrs. Ramey; U.S, Consul-General S. J.
Fletcher and Mrs. Fletcher ; Commodore
H, J. Buchanan and Mrs. Buchanan (her
beanie trimmed with dyed ermine);
Colonel John Keir and his daughter
Joan ; Rear-Admiral J. W. Wishart and
his wife; Major-General and Mrs. S. R.
Burston; Capt. and Mrs. Neil Mackin-
non; the Norman Bennetts; Mr. and
Mrs, J. Brophy; Mrs. Walter Cass and
her daughter Angela.
There was a simple and touching cere-
mony at the headquarters of the Aus-
tralian Red Cross in Flinders-street, when
Red Cross council-members, friends and
former associates of the late Matron
Olive Dorothy Paschke, R.R.C., saw
Mrs. O. E. Paschke handed the Florence
Nightingale Medal awarded post-
humously to her daughter. The late
Matron Paschke, formerly of Dimboola,
died on active service with the Australian
Army Nursing Service in February, 1942.
The Women’s Hospital Appeal for
£150,000 has now closed, and it is a
tribute to the generosity of the people
of this State that it was oversubscribed
by £lO,OOO. Now, to renovate old, in-
convenient and often dangerous build-
ings, the Victorian Association of Day
Nurseries is appealing to the public for
£30,000 to carry out this necessary work.
At a luncheon in the Oriental Hotel given
by the president of the association, Mrs.
T. C, Dickson, Lady Brooks, who is
patroness of the association, launched the
appeal. How right Lady Brooks was
when she said the love, skill and patience
of the nurseries staff are to no avail
when the management is continually
wondering where the next penny is coming
from! Mrs. L. T. Gedye, who is organiser
of the appeal, told of the reply of one
matron in charge of a day nursery when
asked what was her most pathetic case.
“I am, because day after day I have to
keep on turning children away.” At
present the association has 11 creches in
industrial suburbs.
This is Elizabeth Irene (Betty), only
daughter of Mrs. Jackson, of Toorak, and
the late G. U. Jackson, who was married
at Melbourne Grammar Chapel to
Douglas Oswald, elder son of Mr. and
Mrs. Oswald Bowden, also of Toorak.
She wore a long-sleeved gown of
brocaded duchess satin, with ivy-leaves of
satin appliqued at the neckline. A pearl
coronet held in place the long tulle veil,
and she carried a bouquet of gardenias.
Her three attendants, Pauline Bowler,
Mildred Hailes and the ’groom’s sister
Judith, wore Juliet caps of white guipure
lace with their bouffant frocks of white
faille. Murray Morris was best man and
Bruce Bowden and Reginald' Tolley, an
Adelaide copsin of the bridegroom, were
groomsmen. '
More than 100 guests attended the
buffet-dinner and dance afterwards, at
the Australia. Mrs. Jackson received the
guests in a junior-blue tie-silk frock and
matching jacket; her swathed hat of
matching tulle was finished with ospreys.
Mrs. Bowden’s draped frock was of black
silk-jersey, her black hat of tulle. Sheila
HarbinsQn wore a black velvet frock
which had a plunging' neckline ; a green
osprey decorated her small black velvet
cloche. Jennifer Seeley teamed a white
guipure lace bodice and a bouffant green
velvet skirt, topping them with a head-
hugging white feather-hat. Pamela
Wiggatt’s black velvet cloche, ornamented
with diamente, was worn with a white
broderie Anglaise frock. Margot Petti-
grew chose a black faille coat, a white
lace frock and a small matador hat of
black velvet finished with bobble-fringe.
Mrs. Leslie Cranbourne’s black wool
crepe frock had a deep, scooped neck-
line ; of black velvet was. her pillbox hat.
Mrs. George Derham covered her frock
with a pale-gold faille coat; her cloche
was of black faille.
Musicians were veritably ten-a-penny
at the party given in the Union House
by the Vice-Chancellor of the University,
Professor Paton, and his wife, for the
Italian conductor, Alceo Galliera, and
Signora Galliera. Mrs. Paton’s black suit
was worn with an ice-blue blouse and a
small black hat, softly veiled. Signora
Galliera added a full-length ocelot coat to
her black frock ; her small cloche was of
blonde satin. Among the guests were
Lady Heinze, in white boater and black
suit; Mrs. Con Charlton, in black
ensemble; Betty Steele, wearing a grey
tailored suit and matching hat. Dr.
Percy Jones and the Italian Consul, Dr.
Dainelli, had a busy time translating.
The new Oronsay is in very truth a
floating palace. Many guests were invited
by Sir Colin Anderson to a party on
board and then were shown over fche
ship. One of the most interesting spots
is the restaurant, air-conditioned and
made attractive by the amusing “dood-
lings” by Douglas Annand, of Sydney,
on almost 400 square feet of wall-space.
The artist went to England expressly to
carry out this work, as the drawings had
to be made direct on to specially-prepared
paper, which was then pressed into plastic
sheets. The pattern of the carpet,
another jig-saw of “doodles” in mottled
green, is the work of the same artist.
The pannelling, the deep wide windows
and the lovely curtains and furnishings
of the public-rooms, are a sheer delight.
Very up-to-date is the hospital with its
surgery, three general wards and
maternity and nursing wards. Light
African mahogany is the theme-wood
throughout the ship. From the foyer the
main staircase takes passengers down to
the dining-room. On each of the four
half - landings, most original three-
dimensional decorations of pressed
flowers, grasses and butterflies form the
decorative note. In addition to the large
and imaginatively-equipped children’s
play-room there is at the forward end
of the deck adjoining it a playground
with paddling-pool and sandpit. Lady
Anderson and two daughters have come
with Sir Colin, and they will stay five
months. The elder girl will go to Fren-
sham, the younger to Ascham.
Judge and Mrs. F. B. Gamble, of Mont
Albert, have received word that their
youngest daughter Jennifer, and Hugh,
son of Judge and Mrs. L. Stretton, of
Diamond Creek, were married in the
chapel of Balliol College, Oxford, last
Monday. The bridegroom is a Junior
Dean and Fellow of Balliol. Sixty guests
were at the reception, which was held in
the common-room of the college.
Jennifer designed her own wedding-gown
of white cloque. Judy Austin, her brides-
maid, wore pale-grey. Australian friend
Creighton Burns gave the bride away,
and David Holt was best man. The
bride’s mother sent the wedding-cake to
England ; and it arrived in excellent con-
dition. Close relatives and friends were
entertained by Judge and Mrs. Gamble
at their home on the wedding-night to
toast the newly-wedded pair.
Once a year members of the Hawthorn
Club entertain at the New Alexandra,
East St. Kilda, and it must be said, judg-
ing by this year’s function, that the enter-
tainments committee running it knows its
job. The president, John Allison, and his
wife, received the guests, Mrs. Allison
wearing a full-skirted gown of black
French crepe with creamy roses clustered
at the waistline. Mrs. W. Darragh, wife
of the chairman of the entertainments
committee, chose a slimly-cut gown of
black crepe romaine with touches of ice-
blue crepe on the bodice. Mrs. Eric
Barker’s satins were hyacinth-blue. Mid-
night-blue Chantilly lace fashioned the
dinner gown worn by Mrs. George Napier.
An ankle-length grey moire taffeta frock
and matching bolero were the choice of
Mrs. C. Miers. A stole of beaten-gold
on black silk was worn by Mrs. L. Philips
with her black-and-gold brocade gown.
Mrs. F. Pearce wore black velvet, Mrs.
Ross Tait jade-green tulle. Judy Hender-
son danced in ice-blue satin. Margaret
Murphy’s gown of oyster satin bared one
shoulder; Mrs. Sam Serman’s midnight-
blue brocades were patterned with tiny
scarlet flowers. A fichu collar was a
feature of Mrs. J. Piesse’s bronze brocade
frock. Of dainty white tulle was Kath
Kerle’s frock.

Still on pilot duty and still looking on
boarding a vessel in a heavy sea as every-
day routine. Captain J. M. Ahearn, born
in Sussex in 1886, at sea 14 years later in
the clipper Golden Gate. After seven
years in sail he was one of four survivors
of the full-rigged ship Lismore, wrecked
off Santa Maria Island on the Chile coast;
after a further nine he shifted
to steam, with his square-rigged
master’s ticket. Joining the Adelaide
Steamship Co. in 1911 he later trans-
ferred to the Queensland Pilot Service,
and though officially retired after 25
years of that he has come back on deck
as relieving harbor-master and pilot in
Mackay. Taking the Wellpark to sea
after Mackay farmers and townsmen had
loaded her sugar probably reminded him
of another “black-ship” incident in Bowen
some years ago. With wharfies refusing
to cast off the ship’s lines, Ahearn gave
the order to slack away everything, went
slow astern, then slow ahead, snapped all
lines and sweetly proceeded.
“G.H.”: Two years ago The Bulletin
recorded that a young R.A.A.F. Digger,
Percy Kean, was reopening the old silver-
lead King’s Mine, near Ravenswood (Q.).
One of the big producers in the ’eighties,
idle since 1890, the mine had disgorged
£ 136,000-worth of silver-lead. Using two
Army disposals trucks and a sizeable share
of guts, Kean carried, in 20 trips, over
100 tons of mining machinery over almost
impassable roads from Maytown, on the
old Palmer goldfield, to Chillagoe. Still
300 miles from point of installation, the
cumbersome cargo had to be railed to
Mingella, then hauled the last 28 miles
overland to Ravenswood, The par. esti-
mated that, whatever the old mine had,
the pertinacious Digger would succeed in
getting it He has —the machinery so
laboriously carted has been assembled,
water in the 670 ft. shaft has been attacked
with buckets, most of the timber renailed
after its drying-out had loosened it, and
Kean has uncovered some richly-promis-
ing ore.
Until last week Admiral Hyde had been
the only R.A.N. officer appointed a
King’s aide-de-camp. Now a trio can
claim the honor —Captain H. L. Howden,
Captain (S.) J. B. Foley and R.A.N.R.
Commander N. D. Pixley. Howden cap-
tained cruiser Hobart early in the late
scrap, and handled the evacuation of
Berbera; Foley, Director of Supply
Branch personnel at Navy office, had his
share of saltwater with the R.N. in the
North Sea in War I, and was secretary to
Admiral Hyde when he commanded the
Australian Squadron in 1926-29 ; Pixley
is the only Australian Reserve officer so
far honored.
“Ek Dum”: The election of Senator E. W.
Mattner as president of the Senate places the
control of Parliament and of Parliament House
in the hands of two near-neighbors and close
friends. Both Archie Cameron and Ted Matt-
ner are progressive fanners at Balhannah (S.A.),
another near-neighbor and intimate being Tom
Playford, the S.A. Premier. Archie Cameron
concentrates on sub.-clover, hay and a dairy
herd, and raises as good a goose as ever owned
a liver for his friends at Easter. He also has a
fine trout stream, but no fellow-politician is
known to have gone to look at it since Arthur
Calwell paid a visit and was (so local legend
declares) set to digging post-holes. Senator
Mattner, an excellent athlete —he played cricket
for Adelaide University and Australian Rules
League football for Sturt—is, like hjs two neigh-
bors, a returned soldier of War I, and served
also in War 11. He enlisted as a gunner in the
18th Battery, F.A., and served in Egypt and
France, coming home laden with an M.C.,
DC.M. and M.M. In Hitler’s show he was
major 2/i.c. of the 13th Field Regiment in
Papua. He is now a lieutenant-colonel on re-
serve. In private life he is known as one of the
pioneers of summer potato-cropping in the State
—his yields would make some Australian
growers blush for shame at their own, and he
has a dairy, fat-lamb and clover-farm on the
side.
For the first time an Associate Nieman
Fellowship to Harvard University has
been landed by an Australian —E. W.
Tipping, of Melbourne “Herald.”
Granted to journalists of high com-
petence, the award gives Tipping nine
months at Harvard, and two months
travelling the U.S.A., visiting leading
newspapers. Thirty-five, Tipping has
been 12 years with the “Herald,” inter-
rupted by War II service in the A.I.F.
and R.A.A.F.
John Alexander Graham, who, out of
an estate of £302,000, left £3OOO for a
statue for Ballarat City of Shakspeare
or some other worthy, was the son of the
discoverer of the immensely-rich alluvial
field at Broomfield Gully, Creswick, but
most of his fortune was made from an
obscure room in a Collins-street building.
Having practical knowledge, he studied
mine-plans and reports of produc-
tion, plotted out futures and backed his
fancy. He was unknown to Who’s Who,
held no directorates and never appeared
in public, but mining men were amazed
at the size of his acquirements.
Vienna-born Henry Krips, conductor
of the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra,
who last week scored first-prize in the
Jubilee national song competition, was
one-time conductor of the Salzburg Town
Theatre. Landing in Australia in 1938,
after conducting several of the top
European festivals, he looked after the
Kirsova ballet’s music for a time, con-
ducted for the A.B.C. for six years, and
wrote the music for the films “Smithy”
and “Sons of Matthew,” as well as an
opera and several ballets.
Election to the presidency of the
Associated Chambers of Commerce at 45

know-how —John Allison (done here by

chair. Professor Copland helped him
along with commerce at Melbourne Uni-
versity. One of the new president’s out-
of-office interests is the presidency of the
Uncle Bob’s Club, whose members have
put in their bobs to the tune (since 1942)
of £35,000 for the kids’ section of Mel-
bourne’s Orthopaedic Hospital. Now
they’re after a similar sum for the
Frankston (Vic.) counterpart.
“Fitz”: Drawn by Dubois as he was about to
dash off to address a historical society, Dr.
George Mackaness, whose An Annotated
Bibliography of Henry Lawson is Red Paged
this week, has devoted most of his leisure hours
to research in Australian history and literature.
Understandable, since he is a descendant on the
maternal side from Phillip Goodwin, who came
out in a detachment of marines under Captain
Tench in the Charlotte in the First Fleet, and
on the paternal side from John Mackaness, who
came out as first sheriff of N.S.W. in 1824. As
a historian, Mackaness has written biographies
of Bligh, Phillip, Sir Joseph Banks and Michael
BOOKS.
Howe, “last and worst of the bushrangers,” an
account of Robert Louis Stevenson’s associations
with Australia and a history of the United
Grand Lodge of N.S.W. His work on Aus-
tralian literature includes the Lawson
bibliography, a book on the convict-poet
Michael Massey Robinson (who in 1818 and
1819 was granted two cows from the Govern-
ment herd “for his services as Poet Laureate”),
the editing of prose selections from Lawson
and Louis Becke, and a number of anthologies
of verse, short stories and essays. He has also
produced a number of text-books for teachers
and pupils. Bom at North Sydney close on 70
years ago, Dr. Mackaness went to school first
at Drummoyne (N.S.W.), was a pupil-teacher at
Fort-street Training College, collected his B.A.
and M.A, with honors at Sydney University and
was made a Doctor of Letters by Melbourne
University. He was deputy-head of Fort-street
Boys’ High and was in charge of the Depart-
ment of English at the Sydney Teachers’ Col-
lege. In addition, he has been, or is, a uni-
versity tutorial lecturer, a literary adviser to a
firm of publishers, a member of the advisory
board of the Commonwealth Literary Fund, a
play-producer, a judge of literary competitions
—he was one of the five judges who discovered
those two fine Australian novels A House Is
Built, by M. Barnard Eldershaw, and Coonar-
doo, by Katharine Susannah Prichard, when
The Bulletin ran its first novel competition in
1928 —and is an office-holder in a string of edu-
cational and literary societies.
“S.”: Gestures to Victorian culture in
the Birthday honors were the 0.8.E5. for
Charles Wheeler, Rev, Irving Benson and
Gertrude Johnson. Charles Wheeler’s
recognition will possibly enrage the
moderns, for he is the most academic of
academic artists. His cold but meti-
culously drawn nudes decorate the walls

ance and have been hung at the R.A. and

pendent of the subsidy granted it by one-
time Premier Hollway. A prot6g£e of
Melba, Miss Johnson was once principal
soprano at Covent Garden, but gave up
singing to further her dream of a national
theatre for Australia.
One of the last of the first brigade
passed on in Melbourne last week in
William Guy Higgs—like the three sur-
viving members of the first Federal Par-
liament, a former member of the Labor
party. Federal Treasurer in 1915-16, he
fell out with Hughes, P.M., oyer the con-
scription issue and threw in his portfolio.
Frank Forde caused his final exit when
he defeated him for Capricornia in 1922.
Thereafter until his death, Higgs in-
terested himself in the mentally afflicted.
It was a passion with him —he published
a book exposing the conditions in Vic-
torian asylums and held several hectic
meetings at the Melbourne Town Hall,
where he had patients telling their stories
from the platform. A deeply religious
man, he published two tracts, “Thoughts”
and “A Prayer.” Before he entered poli-
tics he was a printer, and edited two of
the earliest and fieriest Labor papers. He
was 89.
“El V.”; It is to be hoped that no tired
Senator will try a fall with Major-General
George Rankin, D. 5.0., and Bar, who
has become Chairman of Committees of
that august body. The late command-
ing officer of the 4th A.L.H. in World
War I, he is one of the solidest of fighting
propositions, and has a fist like a leg of
iamb —1951 lamb. His record as a soldier
was brilliant and culminated as G.O.C.
2nd Cavalry Division 1937-42. There are,
however, admiring colleagues who give
the palm over his fighting qualities to his
repartee. In the House of Representa-
tives, in which he sat (1937-49) before
transferring to the Senate, even the
toughest products of the A.L.P. preferred
not to cross swords with him. But as a
committee chairman he will be respected.
“C.Q.”: It is commonly imagined that
successful artists make enormous fortunes.
They seldom do. A man who was as
successful at his business as Septimus
Power was at his art might, but all that
the celebrated painter of horseflesh left
was £1284 (to his f son and widow),
although most of his life he had important
commissions, every gallery in Australia
has examples of his work, some of his
war pictures were purchased by the
Imperial War Museum, and the National
Gallery in Melbourne paid 1000 guineas
for his “On the Moors.” One of his
annual shows at the Melbourne
Athenaeum netted over £2OOO and they
seldom fell below £lOOO. The taxation
department got its full share of the
artist’s earnings. Just before he died
Power told me that if he hadn’t to earn
money he wouldn’t paint another
picture.
Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 80, Edward Joseph Mul-
vany, formerly secretary of the Department of
Commerce and Agriculture and later economic
adviser to the Dried Fruits Control Board.
He was the father of Judge Mulvany.
At Saddleworth (S.A.), at 85, Frederick Cole-
man, one of the State’s best-known agricul-
turists. Wheatgrowing experimenting his
speciality, he had had 27 years with the Ad-
visory Board of Agriculture and was on the
councils of Roseworthy College and the R.A.S.
At Pennant Hills (N.S.W.), at 80, Thomas
Hugh Close, of whom The Bulletin 36 years
ago recorded, on hjs election to a Fellowship
of the Royal Astronomical Society—“ His long-
suit is mathematical calculation: he can plan
down the path of an erratic comet with a cer-
tainty that would make the fortune of a racing
tipster.” Lecturer at Sydney Observatory on
the computing of comets’ orbits, he was, as
well, a civil engineer, and retired in 1930 as
principal designing-engineer for the N.S.W.
Railways, after 44 years’ service.
At 71, in Melbourne, Jack Holt, one of the
best-known of Australian racehorse-trainers. He
trained more champions than any other trainer
in Australian turf history, and won more than
half a million in stake-money for his clients.
Living all his life at Mordialloc, on the Mom-
ington Peninsula, he held the premiership of
Victorian trainers 12 times —a record.

CYCLONIC NIGHT
by
STANDBY
(R. S.PORTEOUS)
NUGGET HUGHES was
worried. For two days
and nights it had been
raining, and tonight it was
lashing down in streaming
torrents, rattling like flung buck-
shot on the galvanised-iron roof,
The sou’-easter, too, was rising ;
moaning and whistling round the
house in ever-increasing gusts,
Every door and window in the
house was closed, but somehow
the wind drifted in, eddying
around the kitchen so that the
kerosene-lamp flickered and
smoked continuously.
According to the wireless fore-
casts a cyclonic centre was
moving in towards the coast
more than a hundred miles
south of the township—a safe
distance away.
But Nugget didn’t trust wire-
less forecasts. He knew nothing
of cyclones, except by hearsay,
but he did know that the wind
tonight was the strongest he’d
ever heard. He felt he should
have been down at the inlet,
looking after his launch. He’d
have been down there an hour
ago had it not been for Barbara,
If he suggested leaving her alone
on such a wild night there’d be
a scene for sure.
It wasn’t that Barb was a
pampered city girl. She’d been
brought up in the bush ; and ever
since she left school she’d had
to battle for herself. When he
first met her, just after he came
back from the war, she was
working in the local pub. A
tough job, that,
It was absurd, but Barb was
jealous of the launch. She
resented the hours he spent work-
ing on it and claimed that he
thought more of it than he did
of her. In their short married
life it had been the cause of their
only quarrels. It didn’t make
sense to Nugget. It was the only
flaw in this tall, slim girl who had
been his wife for nearly twelve
months. Maybe she wasn’t so
very tall as girls go, but she
stood half a head above Nugget,
whose short, stocky figure had
earned him his nickname. All
his life he’d been “Nugget” at
school, in the Army and here in
the little coastal township he
now called home. His lack of
height had long ceased to worry
him. Short he may have been,
but he was broad-shouldered and
powerful. In this farming com-
munity where necessity forced
men to value strength and en-
durance he was known as the
toughest man and the best cane-
cutter in the district.
"T HE house vibrated under a
* fresh blast of wind, and
Nugget frowned anxiously. He
walked to the window and stared
for several minutes at the water
streaming across the glass. *
“Barb,” he said, turning away
at last. “I’m goin’ down to the
boat.”
“Oh, Nugget! Not on a night
like this!” There was reproach
and anxiety in the girl’s voice,
“The boat’ll be safe. You said
so yourself.”
“I know. But I never thought
it would blow like this.” Once
again he wanted to explain to
her that his anxiety for the
launch had nothing to do with
his love for her. The launch
represented his savings from two
seasons of cane-cutting, it repre-
sented security for them in the
“slack.” He’d done well with
his fishing since the crushing
ended, so well that he was talk-
ing of chucking cane-cutting
altogether after next season. No
more coming home every night
of the crushing black as a nigger
from the burnt cane, no more
hunting for odd jobs in the slack
or hanging around the pub,
running up bills to be paid as
soon as the mills started again,
He wanted to make Barb
understand all this, but because
talking had never been his strong
point he merely said, “If she
starts to drag with the tide ebbin’
she’ll go up on them oyster
rocks.”
Already he was pulling on a
thick flannel shirt. Watching
him tuck it into his faded blue
shorts Barbara knew it would be
useless to plead with him, use-
less also to ask him to wear an
overcoat. Despite all she might
say he’d go as he was, bare-
footed and bareheaded. The
grim expression on his usually
cheerful face told her that. Be-
sides. Nugget hated shoes ;
clothes, other than a singlet and
shorts, always irked him. Even
the flannel shirt was an unusual
concession to the wildness of the
night. It was dry and fairly snug
here in the cottage. Outside it
would be terrifying.
Striving to keep the bitterness
out of her voice she said, “I
s’pose you’ll stay down there
all night?”
Nugget’s homely face broke
into a grin. “No flamin’ fear I
won’t,” he assured her. “You
don’t think a man’d stay out in
this for fun, do yer, Barb?”
His farewell kiss was absent-
minded, a mere formal peck as
he strode for the door,
“I wouldn’t put it past you,
once you get down to that rotten
old boat,” she flung after him.
The wind eddied and swirled
around him as he stepped out-
side. Even here, on the lee side
of the house, he could feel the
savage fury of it. Above him in
the darkness he could see the
branches of the big ironbark
bending and swaying wildly,
With a sudden flash of inspiration

Scots (ilhisky
he wrenched the door open and
stepped back inside.
“Listen, Barb, if it gets any
worse you nick over to Andy’s
place, eh?”
“Whatever for?” Her surprise
at such a request showed in her
face, in the tone of her voice.
“This here is mighty like a
cyclone,” Nugget told her
doggedly. “Houses get blown
down in cyclones. You’ll be safe
over at Andy’s if it does get real
bad.”
“It couldn’t blow this place
down,” Barbara said. “It’s only
new.”
“Just the same,” Nugget per-
sisted, “you go over to Andy’s
place if it starts to blow any
worse.”
Without any intention of keep-
ing her promise she nodded and
said, “Right-oh”; adding with
sulky sarcasm, “I must say it’s
a fine time to be leaving your
wife at home when you think
the house is goin’ to be blown
down.”
Nothing that he could say
would put him in the right.
Knowing that, Nugget stepped
outside and shut the door.
I T was less than half a mile
I to the inlet where he kept his
launch, yet it seemed to him,
young and strong though he was,
to take hours to cover the
distance. Down the wide main
street he sloshed, ankle-deep in
water, head down, battling
against the gale. In the fiercer
gusts he simply stood still, lean-
ing far forward on the wind. If
by some miracle it had sud-
denly stopped he would have
fallen flat on his face in the
mud. On either side lights shone
feebly from the houses, glinting
on a dark sea of water. From a
near-by shed came the steady
clatter-clatter of a loosened sheet
of iron. There’d be more than
one sheet of iron loose before
morning. Nugget guessed.
Three hundred yards and the
street ended. From here on
only a narrow track wound
through the thick timber. It was
impossible to see it In the dark-
ness and pouring rain, but
Nugget followed it by instinct.
He had expected to get some
protection from the wind once
he got among the trees, but if
anything it was worse here. He
struggled from tree to tree, some-
times grasping a swaying sapling
and pausing to regain his breath,
sometimes stumbling heavily
over newly-fallen branches.
The tide was half-out, he saw,
when he reached the inlet. The
faint shape about twenty yards
offshore was his launch, still safe,
stiff riding to her mooring; but
instead of heading up to the
strong run of ebb-tide she was
lying across-stream, held there
by the force of the wind. Here,
on the exposed beach, the buffet-
ing violence of the gale was un-
believable, making it impossible
to stand in one place. The
narrow inlet that Nugget had
never seen anything but flat calm
was churned to a mass of gleam-
ing waves that crashed on the
strip of beach, leaving lines of
black seaweed on the white sand.
Nugget waded in, feeling
grateful for the warmth of the
sea-water on his chilled body,
grateful, too, for the partial pro-
tection it offered from the wind.
The waves lapped around his
waist and he felt the strong pull
of the ebb tide. The water was
up to his armpits when he
reached the launch. Working
his way around to the stern he
clambered aboard. The launch
was pitching and rolling in the
confused chop, but it was not her
lively movements that caused his
first mishap. He hadn’t even
drawn himself fully erect when a
gust of wind flung him over-
board. He came to the surface
and struggled back on board,
knowing fear for the first time
since he’d left the Army. If
the wind could do that to him,
then it was really blowing. Mov-
ing on all fours, clinging firmly
to the gunwale, he lowered him-
self into the cockpit.
What next, he wondered? His
knowledge of seamanship was
limited. When he left the house
he’d had some vague idea of
starting the engine and moving
the launch higher up the inlet
where he could make her fast to
some mangroves. Now he
doubted if the engine would
move her against this wind.
Crouched in the partial shelter
of the cockpit he could feel it
tearing at him with the strength
of some monster, at times press-
ing down on him, at others lift-
ing him in an effort to hurl him
once more over the side.
When he’d put this mooring
down he’d laughingly stated that
it would hold the Queen Mary.
His launch was only a twenty-
six-footer with a draught of two-
and-a-half feet, yet tonight he
felt that even the huge concrete
block and heavy chain were puny
things to hold her off the jagged,
oyster-covered rocks twenty
yards astern.
Better start the engine, he told
himself, and see if we can get
out of this. Give her a go, any-
way.
Five minutes of furious crank-
ing convinced him that the
engine was useless ; probably the
wiring was thoroughly saturated.
He cursed the rain and hurled
the crank-handle savagely to the
floor.
AND then, for the first time,
he became really aware of
the noise of the wind. He had
felt the impact of the handle on
the planking under his feet, but
he hadn’t heard the faintest
sound of the crash it must have
made. How could he hear it
above this mighty roaring? It
filled his ears, filled the inlet with
its deep-toned, vibrating roar.
The only thing Nugget could
liken it to was being shut in a
hangar while a Flying Fortress
revved up all four engines to
their fullest power. He’d never
experienced such a thing, but he
imagined it must be very much
like this.
The realisation that the launch
had swung broadside to the wind
banished all thoughts of Fort-
resses. It could only mean that
she was dragging her mooring.
An anxious study of the man-
groves along the bank confirmed
it. They were undoubtedly
coming closer.
Nugget didn’t hesitate. Grasp-
ing the gunwale firmly he slid
overboard. The engine was use-
less, but he still had his immense
strength. The launch might drag
her moorings, but she wasn’t
going to bash herself to bits on
those rocks. Not if he could
help it. If he lost her he’d be
right back where he started —a
cane-cutter in the season, a hard-
up odd-job man in the slack.
The wind had the launch
forced over almost on her beam-
ends and he had one shoulder
under the gunwale, heaving with
all his strength against it. Back
he went, giving ground gradu-
ally, reluctantly, fighting every
inch of the way. He’d hold her
in the shallower water, he told
himself grimly. The water here
was too deep ; his own buoyancy
was defeating him.
Back, back. Even in the
shallowing water he was being
driven steadily shorewards. The
bottom changed from sand to
mud, then underfoot he felt the
sharp, jagged edges of oysters
and barnacles. This was it!
There was no retreat from here.
He felt no pain from the great
gashes in' his bare feet, felt no-
thing but the remorseless pound-
ing weight on his shoulder and
the buffeting of the gale on his

THE ISLAND IN THE RIVER.
I could have told them but they would not listen,
shouting and screaming at me as they dived
at my head. We had our violent
arguments pitched across the din of the torrent.
The river? It is a collocation of white
nerves, a bundle of vibrating threads;
it is a new thought in the mind, intent
on creating new channels; it is memory
and the agony of remembering; it is the voice, quiet now,
filled once with passion and shrill anger.
The stones, the countless myriads of stones? The cells
of earth’s massive and slumbrous flesh. The jungle
of gorse and thistle and broom? It is nothing,
merely a green dream, something conforming
to a scented chaos in the soul,
coming forth in disguise and fragrance. But the gulls:
I could have told them not to nest there
on an island that was an island only
for the space of the life of a thought.
In a stagnation of boulders and sand they built
their city of nests and in the flood were caught.

"September Tide."
Starting off with the familiar
quotation from “Julius Cassar”
—“There is a tide in the affairs
of men,” etc. “September
Tide,” at Melbourne Comedy,
is a sympathetic description, by
Daphne du Maurier, of the tri-
angular matrimonial situation,
this time varied by an unusual
angle.
Evan, a perfectly nice young
artist, has married Cherry, a per-
fectly nice girl, though intellec-
tually as silly as a rabbit. She
takes him home to the house of
her mother Stella, a perfectly
nice woman, still beautiful and
much more intelligent than her
daughter. Stella falls in love
with her son-in-law, and this is
the tide in the affairs of Evan.
He can’t take it at the flood and
neither can Stella.
Before their marriage, in true
modern style Evan and Cherry
have come to an agreement that
in no circumstances will they
stand in the way of one another’s
freedom like their grandmas,
but when the crisis arrives they
react to it precisely as their
grandmas would have. Stella
feels horribly guilty in relation
to her daughter and Evan feels
horribly guilty in relation to his
wife. Cherry doesn’t feel any-
thing, because, believing com-
pletely in the conventions, she
hasn’t noticed anything what-
ever, and only feels bewildered
by the change in her mother’s
and her husband’s feelings.
A seafaring son, arriving
home with a broken limb and
as oblivious of what is going on
as Cherry, provides a diversion
and the crisis passes. The
mother horrifies her daughter by
deciding to marry a stiff old gent
who has courted her for 10
years and whom she doesn’t like,
and Evan decides to take his wife
to New York. The shallows and
miseries of their subsequent
voyage are left to the imagina-
tion, but Miss du Maurier does
not sentimentalise the situation.
Though some of the writing
and some of the business is not
of the highest order, Evelyn
Laye, the English actress, is
never emotionally cheap as the
mother, and Frank Lawton
seems to feel the part of the
husband.
"The Merry Wives of
Windsor."
The Melbourne Conserva-
torium of Music, which was
Melba’s old school, came out
of its retirement with an excel-
lent contribution (at the Princess
Theatre) to the Commonwealth
Jubilee Celebrations with this
comic opera by Otto Nicolai,
who was almost a contemporary
of Mozart and was so obviously
influenced by him that there are
passages in his opus that might
have come from the hand of that
master. Its arias, choruses and
incidental music, added to the
robustness of Shakspeare’s dia-
logue and the bustling story,
make a richer compost than
hundreds of comic operas which
have held the stage since its day.
The Conservatorium had the
services of J.C.W.’s Frederick
Blackman as producer and
Herbert Davis as conductor, and
it was all remarkably well done.
Dorothy Canberra, as Mistress
Ford, was the only singer of
professional status. Morris Barr,
as the fat knight with a divided
interest between Venus and
Bacchus, played the disappointed
cuckold and lowered the sack
with a gusto that matched the
size of his stomach, and Dzun-
tars Veide showed himself a
first-class actor as Mr. Ford.
Estonian Artists.
No major talent has so far
been seen among all the New
Australians from all over
Europe who have been exhibit-
ing in Sydney, but there is no
doubt about the minor enrich-
ment they have already pro-
vided, which promises so well
for the future. The outstanding
exhibits at a recent Estonian
House festival were three water-
colors of Tasmanian landscape
by Mart Roosma; with Alfons
Rammo’s oil of “Tallinn
Harbor” and Anna Kompus-
Pollusaar’s “Sleeping Child.”
Tom Ugly’s Point, where
Sydney motorists go to eat
oysters, appears with some diffi-
culty in the catalogue as “Tom
Ugle’s Point” and — in a second
shot at it —“Tom Ungle’s
Point” ; and “Backyard in Surry
Hills, wash” is rendered sonor-
ously in Estonian as “Surry
Hill tagahoov, pintslijoonistus ”
Which shows that it takes a little
time to jet acclimatised in a new
country, in art as well as in
orthography.
Jubilee Art.
The Jubilee, open art com-
petition which is being con-
ducted in all States will close at
noon on Friday, June 29. All
entries from N.S.W. should
reach the National Art Gallery,
Sydney, by that date.
The judges—Douglas Dundas,
Lloyd Rees and William Dobell
—will select five works from the
N.S.W. entries. These will be
sent to Brisbane for the final
judging after they have been
exhibited with the other com-
petitors’ works at the National
Art Gallery.
We are informed that Ola
Cohn’s work in wood, stone and
terracotta at Stanley Coe’s
Gallery, in Melbourne, does not
belong to the abstract school of
sculpture whose high-priest is
British sculptor Henry Moore,
but to the school which seeks
to endow inanimate material
with “the vital force of life” and
which holds that form does not
exist merely as form but is used
to express lasting spiritual values.
We are still confronted with the
statues, which are titled “Re-
pose,” “Affection,” etc., and we
recognise them as representing
human beings, much as we
recognise a caricature as such,
but, although the forms are
strange, the quality within the
forms is familiarly academic.
Two small terracotta groups
called “Peace” and “Fear,” de-
picting two mothers with babies
on their laps, have more life in
them than any of the big works.
Entries for the 1951 art com-
petition conducted by the
Mosman Municipal Council
must be delivered to the Town
Clerk, Mosman Town Hall, not
later than September 10, 1951.
Subjects for the competition are
(a) a landscape in oils, and ( b )
a watercolor of any subject;
prizes are 100 guineas for the
landscape and 40 guineas for
the watercolor, the winning
entries to remain the property
of the council. Entry forms and
other details may be obtained
from the Mosman Town Clerk.
Music.
The first of the two one-act
operas produced by the Sydney
Con. Student Opera School was
“Judith,” a biblical tragedy, with
music by Eugene Goossens,
who conducted both operas.
The story drags its slow length
along for an hour, and there
isn’t a bar of the vocal writing
that one would remember. De-
bussy had the same idea of dis-
pensing with melody in the
“opera” which he took 10 years
to write; that is why his
“Pelleas and Melisande,” which
Mr. Goossens presented last
year, is, and will remain, a
museum-piece. Joan Suther-
land, James Wilson and Ronald
Dowd —the latter in indifferent
voice—sang the main roles in
“Judith.” The other offering was
Puccini’s “Gianni Schicchi,” the
highly-amusing situations of
which were carried through with
admirable snap and ebulliance
by the entire cast. An outstand-
ing piece of work was done by
Frank Lisle in the title role as
the sly, shrewd imposter who
tricks the hungry relatives of
the rich departed. Arete
Zantiotis sang the “My Beloved
Daddy” air with charm and
restraint.

Having communicated, in a
surprisingly short time, some of
his own fire to the Victorian
Symphony Orchestra, '“perma-
nent” conductor Alceo Galliera
led it through a magnificent pro-
gramme at his third concert at
Melbourne Town Hall. The two
highlights of the evening were
the Cesar Franck Symphonic
Variations for Piano and Orch-
estra and the “New World” of
Dvorak. Melbourne pianist
Nancy Weir made as stirring a
business of the Franck variations
as the conductor did of Dvorak’s
endeavor to capture the spirit of
American Indian and negro folk-
music. He made it live. Miss
Weir did the same with her in-
terpretation of the variations.

Blonde and magnificent, like
the Wagnerian heroines in her
repertoire, Marjorie Lawrence
was a commanding figure in her
recital at the Brisbane CityLHalL
Her opening aria, Verdi’s
tremendous “O Don Fatale,”
showed to advantage the amaz-
ing contralto scope of this
dramatic soprano, but it was the
difficult Schubert “Death and
the Maiden” that really disclosed
her vocal range and artistry. In
this, and in Brahms and the
Haydn setting of Shakspeare’s
lines “She never told her love,”
Miss Lawrence showed she has
at her command those mental
and emotional qualities which
place her in an even more select
group of celebrities, the first-
rate singers of German lieder.

It says much for Marjorie
Lawrence’s determination and
strength of character that she
was able to go through her
exacting Sydney recital follow-
ing a wild night air-trip from
Canberra, where she had that
day sung in the rain at the open-
ing the Jubilee Parliament. Her
voice inevitably showed the
strain, particularly in the
operatic numbers. Yet in the
second half she made a remark-
able vocal recovery with the fag-
end popular ballads, delivered
even with some verve, Ray-
mond Lambert accompaniments
and solos were first-rate.

!
As every mother knows, the nearest thing to
perpetual motion is a small boy. This fellow is
Superman, swooping down on the “baddies.” He
needs a lot of exercise like this, in the fresh air
and sunshine, to grow healthy and strong.
.
When Superman has tidied up the situation, he
comes in and gets himself a slice of bread and
jam. He is replacing the energy used up in his
game. Jam, and many other delicious foods,
like biscuits, custards, and preserved fruits, are
rich in sugar, a wholesome energy food. Sugar
is an essential part of the balanced diet
youngsters need.

exposed head. But he was hold-
ing her now. His body was be-
tween the launch and the rocks
and she wasn’t crashing on them.
Desperately he held her off,
striving to force his brain to
work, to think of some plan.
Obviously he couldn’t hold her
here indefinitely. Soon his
strength would give out and he’d
be crushed between this dead-
weight and the rocks. If he
could move the launch fifty
yards downstream with the tide
helping him she might take the
bottom on soft mangrove mud.
Couldn’t come to much harm
there, surely?
Working around so that his
back was towards the launch he
took the weight on both
shoulders and heaved. It was
useless. With every muscle of
his splendid, thickset body
tensed, exerting every ounce of
his power, he was simply holding
her in the one place. He was
sobbing now, crying with rage
and sheer physical exhaustion.
For the first time in his life he
was hopelessly beaten.
He may have been holding the
launch there for five minutes, or
five hours—time had stopped—
when he felt himself falling back-
wards. He drew his feet under
him, braced himself and moved
another step backwards. Al-
though he was dimly aware
that the launch was no longer
heeling sharply towards him
it took him three more back-
ward steps to realise that he was
moving her, moving her away
from the rocks and downstream.
Gradually it dawned on him that
the wind had stopped. No
longer were his ears filled with
the terrific roaring; there was
no noise other than the hissing
of the heavy rain on the water.
It was unbelievable, impossible
that this raging frenzy of wind
could cease so abruptly—like the
cutting-off of the engines of the
Fortress. But it was true. With-
out further assistance from him
the launch swung, head to cur-
rent, and rode to her mooring
while he clung limply to her
gunwale, exhausted and gasping
in great tearing breaths.
Because he was young and
strong he recovered quickly. As
his breathing returned to normal
so his brain cleared, reminding
him of the stories he’d heard of
other cyclones. This unnatural,
uncanny stillness was but a lull,
the very centre of the cyclone.
Soon, possibly in a few minutes,
the wind would come raging
down from the opposite quarter
of the compass, worse, if the old
hands were to be believed, than
it had b*een before the lull.
M UGGET didn’t believe that
* the wind could get worse,
but he did know that he had to
work swiftly. He’d tie the launch
to the nearest tree and get back
to the township. He knew now
that he should never have come
down to the inlet, should never
have left Barbara to face such a
night alone. How could he be
sure that she’d even reached the
solid shelter of Andy’s place?
No woman could stand up to
the buffeting he’d been through.
He must get back to her.
Swiftly he freed the launch
from her mooring chain and
waded downstream, pushing her
before him. Twenty yards he
waded before running her ashore
on a strip of muddy beach.
Here, close to the water’s edge,
stood a grove of magnificent old
tea-trees —gnarled, sturdy giants
that had withstood the gales
for probably more than a
century. Every step was agony,
but Nugget worked with desper-
ate haste. What if the house
collapsed on Barb before she had
time to get away? He doubled
his anchor-rope, ran it to the
nearest tree and took a quick turn
around its massive trunk. That
would hold her, hold anything.
Make fast and leave her, get
started for the township before
the wind came again.
The new wind caught him at
that moment, came bellowing
across from the nor’-west, tear-
ing branches from the trees and
flinging them far out over the
inlet. Above him Nugget could
see the old tea-tree bowing down,
writhing fantastically as its
more slender limbs were torn
from it. Crouching close to the
trunk he knotted the heavy rope.
A near-by tree leaned crazily
over and subsided in a twisted
mass, the crash of its falling lost
in the roaring of the gale.
Another followed, sending a
shower of leaves and twigs swirl-
ing around Nugget’s tree. Soon
it, too, must go. He could feel
it grinding and twisting under
his grip. In this mad inferno
nothing stayed, nothing was per-
manent. Nugget would not have
been surprised if the very earth
had been torn up and flung
before this screaming gale. Two
sets of fears were tearing at him
one telling him he must leave
here, must get back to Barb, the
other telling him to cling to this
partial shelter and not risk death
by moving away.
He felt his tree toppling and
leaped aside only to be flung
backward by a blast of wind.
A heavy limb crashed down and
Nugget, pinned beneath a mass
of splintered branches, ceased
to worry about his launch or his
wife.
darbara was sewing,
mending a pair o/ Nugget’s
shorts, but she found herself in-
capable of concentrating on the
jagged tear. The house was
shaking violently, even swaying,
she fancied. Or was it just a
trick of the smoking, flickering
light? Twice already the lamp
had blown out, leaving hef
trembling in the clamorous
darkness. Removing the hot
glass, cleaning it and striking
innumerable matches were dif-
ficult tasks for nervous fingers,
but the girl forced herself to do
it. Somehow the light created
an illusion of safety. While it
was burning she was surrounded
by four walls, shut away from
the gale that raged outside.
When the lamp went out the
wind seemed to enter, filling the
little room with an awesome
fury of noise.
Trying to concentrate on the
tear in the shorts Barbara knew
that she should have gone over
to Andy’s place before the wind
got so bad. She had refused to
leave, then, had stayed deter-
minedly on, held by the fierce
possessiveness of a woman for
her first real home. This
cottage was hers, she had helped
Nugget build it. It was filled
with her treasures, wedding
presents and furniture still glossy
with the glamorous newness of
the shop. By staying here she
could guard all these things,
move the bed away from the
drip in the bedroom ceiling, put
a basin under another leak over
the kitchen dresser —oh, a score
of little things.
But now fear held her here.
Much as she longed for thei
companionship and the solid
security of Andy’s place she
could not force herself to go
out and face the terrors of this
wild night. If only Nugget
would come back! Surely, at
any moment now, she’d feel the
blast of wind and rain as he
wrenched the back door open,
would see him standing there
grinning as he pulled the sodden
shirt up over his muscular
shoulders!
The blast of wind came. The
light flared and went out.
Barbara called “Nugget!
Nugget! Is that you?”
The wind tore the sound
away, smothering the question.
It was in the room now, swirling
round her, buffeting her, drench-
ing her as it drove the rain
before it.
“The door. Nugget,” she
yelled with all her power.
“Shut the door.”
Only the wind answered, bel-
lowing in mocking derision.
Feeling her way across the
darkened room her hands en*
countered only hard inanimate
things—familiar objects all of
them, but no comfort to a
frightened girl groping blindly
for the warm companionship of
her man. Nugget was definitely
not in the room. The door, she
discovered, was firmly shut, yet
the room was a bedlam of
swirling raging wind and rain.
Glancing upwards the terrified
girl caught a glimpse of heavy
clouds racing low over a tangle
of rafters. The whole roof had
gone! Even as she stared at
them the rafters vanished one
by one, drifting away like dried
straws.
She screamed then, screamed
as she wrenched madly at the
door. One wall swayed towards
her. The door flew open, not
inwards, as it should have done,
but outwards, tearing free of its
hinges and hurling her out just as
the house collapsed.
Her house! Her beautiful
HARES IN THE STRAW.
When summer came in, he stood on his toe
And danced a measure beneath the gum-tree
Showing the girls in the wimmera-rye
How he gave Jimmy Sharman the old one-two:
Yet someone said the boy was shy!
O he leapt through spiderwebs on misty mornings
And never got a singe from the kindled dew
And drew his wage at the foot of the rainbow
Which set the currawongs chiming warnings
Like nuns rope-swinging in the stained-glass blue.
With six singing magpies he went over the skyline
To course with the wind. It was fine to hear
The birds, and to see the great airs hounding
Across the acres of standing sunshine
And the hills crouched low with the crouching hare.
And there they got him. He leapt for cover
But they shot him dead with the dry lightning.
On the winter ridge the crow picks over
His skin is bleaching with the clover
And we must wait for another spring.

new house, pushed over and
brushed aside as swiftly and
houses she had so often brushed
aside as a child. Nothing re-
mained but the old ironbark
tree, its splintered, denuded
branches writhing mutely against
the racing clouds.
A CROSS the street, less than
one hundred yards away, a
light shone faintly from Andy
Velaspi’s house, the house
Nugget had told her to go to
hours, ages ago. She must get
to it. Half the time on hands
and knees, never once daring to
draw herself fully erect, she
battled across the street. The
wind tore at her with bruising
force, the rain lashed her flesh
through her thin cotton frock.
She felt that if she stood up for
one second the wind would lift
her and toss her aloft like a
paper doll.
Ahead, the light still shone
feebly, as far off as ever, it
seemed, until she reached the
telegraph-pole. Though it leaned
downwind and its wires lay in a
tangled mass at its base it was
a landmark, a proof of her
progress towards the light, some-
thing tangible and solid in this
night when everything else
melted before the gale. For a
while Barbara clung to it, glad
of its sturdy support. Some-
thing big hurtled over her head,
struck the post and wrapped
itself around it. Someone’s
blanket, she guessed, stretching
a hand up to feel the flapping
edges. It had arrived silently,
materialising like a flimsy wraith
from the darkness, but out here
there were no individual noises,
nothing but the pulsating roar of
the wind. Her fingers came in
contact with the hard cor-
rugated surface of a sheet of
roofing-iron. The sudden realisa-
tion that death had again missed
her by inches paralysed her so
that she was unable to move,
and could only cling to the base
of the telegraph-pole, sobbing
with fear.
She was still clinging there
when the wind stopped. Unlike
Nugget, who had sought an ex-
planation for this sudden lull,
Barbara didn’t question the ways
of Providence. The light was
still shining through the rain.
She stood up and raced towards
it.
A NDY VELASPI was a
A Maltese, a voluble, bright-
eyed little man with a well-
rounded paunch and an immense
black moustache. Like all his
countrymen he was extremely
proud of his British citizenship.
Pride, in fact, was Andy’s chief
characteristic, for he was
tremendously proud of his farm,
of his personal success, but, most
of all, proud of his house.
Away back in 1918, while he
was still a struggling cane-
farmer, a cyclone had destroyed
his cottage. He learned his
lesson from that blow, and made
up his mind that one day he’d
have a house that would stand
up to anything. And now he
had it. It was far too big for
Andy and his wife, but that was
how he wanted it strong to
withstand possible cyclones and
big to show what a successful
farmer he was. It was ornate
and overfurnished, but it was as
solid as a wooden house could
be. Andy loved to show visitors
over it, pointing proudly to the
solid construction, the loud
carpets and the diesel-driven
lighting-plant, while his faded
little dark-eyed wife looked
patiently on. Like so many
Maltese women Mrs. Velaspi
couldn’t speak a word of
English.
“She don’t learn to speak the
English,” Andy would explain,
“I try to teach her, but it
don’t do any good. No brains,
I think, like y’ know.”
Andy had a habit of tacking
“like y’ know” on to all manner
of sentences.
When Barbara burst in he was
sitting in his big armchah, a
glass of red wine in his hand and
a demijohn on the floor at his
feet. Mrs. Velaspi rose from her
chair and came forward, wide-
eyed and silent. As usual she
was dressed in sombre black.
“Mrs. Nugget ! ” Andy
struggled to his feet and came
forward, still holding the glass
of wine. “Why you don’t come
over before? She’s the bad blow
this, a cyclone like y’ know.”
His flashing brown eyes took in
the wet hair plastered over her
face, and the cotton frock
tattered by the gale and drip-
ping on to the carpet. He said
a few rapid words in Maltese to
his wife and then to Barbara
“She get you some clothes. You
go with her. But first drink
this.”
He thrust the glass of wine
into her hand.
Barbara gulped it greedily.
“Our house, Andy! ” she panted.
“It’s gone. Blown away.”
Andy shook his head in
completely as the flimsy card
sympathy. “Yes,” he said. “I
just tell the old woman plenty
houses get blown down tonight.”
He caressed his great moustache
and looked proudly round the
overfurnished room, bright with
electric light. “But she don’t
blow this place down.” Sud-
denly remembering that
Barbara was alone he asked
“Where’s Nugget?”
“He went down to the boat.”
Barbara’s voice was on the verge
of hysteria. “Hours ago and he
hasn’t come back.”
“It’s like what I always say.”
Andy nodded gravely. “Nugget
he spend too much time foolin’
around that boat.”
He was thinking that if
Nugget made a success of fish-
ing he’d lose his best cane-
cutter.
“He does not.” Swiftly came
the indignant defence. “He’s
been getting it ready for the
fishing, like any sensible man
would.”
“Yes, yes. But he got no
right to leave his wife on a night
like this.”
“He has so! What’d happen
to us if the boat went up on the
rocks? You don’t think he’d
go out on a night like this for
fun, do you?” Unconsciously
she had used Nugget’s defence.
Remembering her own terrible
journey across the street she
finished desperately. “It’s
terrible out there. Anything
might have happened to him.”

miles respectively.
“ .... the two motors are the originals and have not been rebored. ’*
“ Petrol and oil economy has been outstanding .”
“ ... .the body has stood up to a tremendous amount of gruelling
work with absolute satisfaction.”
“ .... my existing fleet of Holdens which have aggregated more
than 600,000 miles, I have now decided to standardise on the

JAP TREATY DEALINGS.
The background of dealings
with Soviet Russia on a Jap
peace treaty are worth keep-
ing in mind against the mis-
representations that Com-
munists, fellow-travellers and
dupes wifi be making now that
Russia has made the “offer”
featured in cables last week.
The facts, briefly, are that
Russia had hitherto flatly re-
jected proposals it now appears
to be putting forward, and had
insisted on the Jap treaty being
made only by the top Powers,
excluding Australia and all the
other smaller nations which
played their part in the Pacific
War.
America, on the other hand,
had stipulated for (he inclusion
of all. It refused, however, a
veto right to any nation par-
ticipating, on which, of course,
it would still insist even if it
could agree to Communist China
taking part with the U.N.O.
brand of “aggressor” on it.
The following factual outline
of the past dealings with Soviet
Russia on the proposed treaty is
condensed from a “New York
Times” article which appeared
before the latest Russian Note:
Up to last February the U.S.
was conducting formal talks with
the Soviet LTnion on various
phases of the treaty problem.
These talks were broken off,
without explanation, by
Moscow.
The impasse between the U.S.
and Russia on one phase of the
treaty problem had been made
abundantly plain more than a
year previously. The Kremlin
took the position that the Jap-
anese treaty should be negotiated
strictly as a “Big Power”
matter with no more than five
States represented. (France was
tentatively included at that
time.) The U.S. has held that
all 14 of the Pacific nations that
were engaged against Japan
should have a voice in the treaty-
making, and suggested that
initiative toward the pact might
properly lie in the Far Eastern
Council. The U.S. held that it
was inconceivable that nations
such as the Philippines and Aus-
tralia should not play an im-
portant part in the treaty-
making.
Subsequently the Kremlin
proposed “consultation” with
the 14 nations that parti-
cipated in the Far Eastern war,
but with the initiative still re-
maining in the hands of the four
Powers.
On March 5 this year the
Soviet representative Malik was
informed that the U.S. would
reject the right of any nation to
exercise a veto-power in respect
to a Jap treaty.
What Russia has since been
manoeuvring for is a con-
ference in which the Com-
munists would exercise not one
veto but two, in which case,
of course, no progress what-
soever could be made on
any terms other than those of
the Kremlin.
“It is quite possible,” com-
mented “New York Times,” “that
the Kremlin feels that its hand
has been forced by the progress
that has been made toward a
genuine peace treaty. The re-
jection of the proposal will at
least give Moscow a chance to
beat the drums to the effect that
any settlement reached in the
Pacific is ‘illegal.’ Moscow’s
idea of a conference would
naturally prevent any settlement
at all, just as Moscow has pre-
vented any settlement in respect
to Germany, Austria or Korea.
But there will be a settlement
in the Pacific, Whether Moscow
wishes eventually to be a party
to it will be for the Kremlin to
decide.”
That comment was made prior
to last week’s Soviet Note, but
in substance it still holds good.
Doubts on Japs.

fears expressed in Japanese
financial and industrial circles
that Britain and some other
countries, who remember the
unscrupulous methods by which
Japan built up her commercial
empire before the war, may
seek preventive terms in the
peace treaty, London “Times”
has noted:
“Outside the United States
there are indeed many who think
that even if Japan can be effec-
tively restrained from fresh de-
signs of expansion by regional
security pacts of the kind Presi-
dent Truman has offered, the
conservative national revival [in
Japan] is ominous. It is already
bringing back to public life
many leaders originally ‘purged’
because of their association with
pre-war policy. The pace of
social reform has been checked ;
the power of organised labor is
curbed; behind the facade of
the new democratic constitution
the forces of ‘Old Japan’ are
again gathering.”
London “Times” resignedly
allows that probably there
is now no alternative to
the American policy of giving
Japan “the kind of treaty that
will deny her manpower and in-
dustrial potential to possible
aggressors and bring her back
into the comity of nations”:
“The real question is whether
American policy has taken all
the implications—economic as
well as political—into account.
“Economic strains may be de-
cisive in the long run. The risk
—“Sacramento Bee,” U.S.A.
NESTING TIME—AND PLACE?
is that growing economic diffi-
culty may drive a Japanese Gov-
ernment again into totalitarian
regimentation, with all its perils
to herself and to her neighbors ;
and it is difficult to see how the
Japanese economy can become
stable without the restoration of
trade with China to its former
size. Yet it is precisely this that
American policy seems calcu-
lated to prevent.
“Unless the United States and
the countries of the Common-
wealth can get together to
remedy this position the revival
of Japan’s economy may force
her to seek outlets along the old
paths of dangerous adventure.”
Moussadek.
A London “Observer” assess-
ment of Persian Prime Minister
Moussadek finds him a tragic
figure, unwittingly paving the
way for Communist rule.
His age, it states, has to be
guessed at; guesses range be-
tween 60 and 90, with 75 prob-
ably near the mark. Retirement
from the Majlis being com-
pulsory at the age of 70, Mous-
sadek is reckoned to have been
celebrating his 69th birthday
for the past six years.
He comes from “one of the
oldest, richest and most
princely families in Persia,” and
owns one of the largest estates
in a country of huge estates held
by a few.
“The “Observer” article pic-
tures him as surrounded by
crooks, adventurers and mad-
men, all of them bent on push-
ing him forward while they lurk
safely in the background. He
is “truly a Frankenstein, and it
may well be that the monster of
religious and patriotic fanaticism
which he did so much to create
is, in sane reality, preparing to
destroy him.” His “sinister and
insubordinate underling,
Kashani, would weep very few
tears if his chief were removed
at a suitable time.”
His tragedy is that, while his
extreme nationalism is an
honorable enough emotion, he
is “certainly being used by the
Communists for their own
ends,” so that probably “his
regime will be the threshold to
a Communist one,” in which
case Moussadek’s reward would
be the same as that of national
leaders in Czechoslovakia and
other Communist - shackled
countries.
Perfumed Persia.
Describing Persia today, a
London “Daily Herald” writer
declares that some four out of
five children born there die in
infancy ; syphilis is rampant;
health services are almost un-
obtainable ; and probably nine
out of 10 Persians are illiterate :
“The wonder is, indeed, that
half of them are not swept
away with typhoid. Down the
main street of Tehran flows a
gutter where beggars wash their
feet and the dust and filth of
the city accumulate; it is the
only water-supply of the capital.
“The social system is rotten
to the core, and the handful of
politicians, mostly landlords,
who manipulate the Persian
Parliament have no interest in
changing it. What they have
an interest in is distracting atten-
tion from domestic ills by stir-
ring up hatred against ‘the
foreigner.’ ”
MacArthur Show.
Even those who most
thoroughly disagreed with
General MacArthur’s varied
proposals were as good as
unanimous on one thing—that
in each of his Congress appear-
ances he easily “stole the
show.”
“I saw and heard General
MacArthur make his first state-
ment to Congress,” wrote a
London “Daily Telegraph” staff
correspondent, “and I am not at
all surprised by its impact upon
the hearts of his audience —an
audience increased by several
million televiewers. The
spectacle of this calm and com-
manding figure, instinct with
belief in himself and his cause,
demonstrating so perfect a com-
pound of dignity, scorn and
resignation, cannot easily be
forgotten.”

correspondent of London “Spec-
tator,” Robert Waithman: —
“General MacArthur’s testi-
mony before the Senate Armed
Services and Foreign Relations
Committees was a remarkable
performance. There can be little
doubt that he emerged from it
with his reputation enhanced.
One reason for that was he had
been handled by the members of
the Joint Committee with a
deference which must have made
it plain to every man, woman
and child who read any of the
testimony that the politicians
felt the interrogation they were
being privileged to conduct was
of no ordinary man.
“Another reason why Mac-
Arthur’s appearances before the
committee were so conspicuously
successful was that he himself
behaved with restraint, spoke
with clarity and argued with
great skill. He might have
exploited the opportunities
freely offered to him to be
vindictive, or sarcastic, or tem-
peramental. Instead the
transcript revealed that he had
maintained a grave, patient
mien, hardly ever faltering,
through hour after hour of
interrogation. By any standards
this sustained performance was
a personal triumph, and the fact
that MacArthur is seventy-one
made it more notable still.”

Expendable Korea. —From one of
a series of articles by New York
“Herald Tribune’s” veteran Far East
correspondent A. T. Steele: “I asked
a highly-placed military man in
Tokyo how things would stand in
that theatre if World War 111 were
to break out tomorrow. His answer
was prompt and emphatic: ‘We would
probably have to get the hell out of
Korea —and fast.’ ”

Brickbats. Heaved by London
“Daily Express”: “Everybody knows
the truth about Kashmir. Mr. Nehru,
the world’s champion big-mouth on
the themes of freedom and down-
with-imperialism, has committed a
flagrant act of aggression, an out-
rageous suppression of freedom. He
uses brute force to prevent the Kash-
mir people uniting with their own
kin. It is no excuse to say that he
shares the guilt with Mr. Attlee, who
was careless, and Lord Mountbatten,
who was foolish. They could, of
course, have prevented the crime.
But Nehru is the criminal.”
# * * *
Jap “Pacifism” —London “Econo-
mist” explains an important angle of
the reported “pacifism” of present-
day Japan: “Today the Japanese
businessman has found by experience
how pleasant it is not to pay any-
thing for national defence while being
protected against both domestic and
external violence by a benevolent
foreign Power anxious to preserve the
country from Communism. The
financiers and industrialists are thus
strongly pacifist and insist that re-
armament must not be permitted to
interfere with the programme of tax
reductions initiated by the Yoshida
Government.”
* * * *
High Cost of Ships. —Faced with
the growing competition of air trans-
port (a London “Times” editorial
points out), shipowners have also to
meet rising costs of construction in
a big way. Examples: The liner
Orcades, built since the war, cost
£3,200,000; a subsequent similar ship
cost £4,000,000, and one which is to
follow “will cost still more.”
* * * *
Chinese Liquidations. —lt will be
some time before a complete, account
of the typical Communist terror in
China can be compiled; the follow-
ing “New York Times” editorial com-
ment is meanwhile a pointer to it:
“The greatly increased tempo of
purges and mass executions is the
best indication that the Chinese Com-
munist regime is conscious of its in-
herent internal weakness. Such a
thing as, for example, the shooting of
293 college professors, factory
managers and other community
leaders on April 30 in Shanghai re-
veals not so much mere blood lust
as it does deep and pervasive fear.”
* * * *
Tito’s Choice. —As to whether Tito
would do better “to bite the bullet”
and join the Western alliance than to
maintain his political independence,
London “Economist” holds that on
balance the argument is on his side
in staying out, while seeking Western
help: “The moral advantage of his
unique position both to his Govern-
ment and to the West is still con-
siderable ; neither would get any bene-
fit from a formal treaty relationship
while the Russians are shouting that
Yugoslavia is to be the springboard
of a Western attack.” Also, some of
the smaller Atlantic-treaty countries
“are not yet ready to embrace the
prodigal son.”
♦ * * *
Truman Tribute. —Declaring “This
paper is in political opposition to the
President,” New York- “Herald Tri-
bune,” with striking fairness, goes
on to comment that “in every emerg-
ency he has risen with a remarkable
firmness —in Persia, Greece and
Turkey, the Marshall plan, the Berlin
blockade, Korea and the Mac Arthur
problem—to take the bold and, as it
has hitherto proved, the right deci-
sion in furtherance of the consistent
policy of peace coupled with resist-
ance.”
♦ * * ♦
Anzacs and the Middle East. —
Noting that the American guarantee to
protect Australia and N.Z. should
have a great effect on [British] Com-
monwealth views about the defence
of the Middle East, London “Econo-
mist” has commented: “For the first
time it bolts the back-doors of Aus-
tralia and New Zealand, so that, if
they send forces overseas for service
in the Middle East, there should be no
more worries about the homeland —as
there were, most understandably, 10
years ago. The New Zealanders have
lately taken a more sanguine view of
these problems than the Australians.
It would be a great thing for the
[British] Commonwealth if the ques-
tion of overseas service could now be
lifted out of the arena of Australian
politics.”

“The referee for the first Rugby
League Test between France and
Australia was given a few lessons in
simple French phrases beforehand to,
facilitate his handling of the match.”
He had the easiest of jobs
compared with mine when I was
selected to referee a game be-
tween French and Polish teams
only an hour or so before kick-
off time because each team flatly
“Which first, Chief —pork or fish?”
refused to agree to the referee
—a compatriot—nominated by
the other.
As neither captain had a
word of English, and my
own bilingualism was limited to
the “Bong swar, sherry,” I had
once extensively used, my
efforts at talking in the Gallic
manner by extensive arm-waving
and shoulder-shrugging met with
little success. It finished up with
someone pushing three large
dictionaries into my hands as I
trotted on to the field —English-
Polish, English-French and
Polish-French.
As the Poles refused to allow
the French skipper to toss his
own coin, demanding neutral
currency, I flipped a shilling-
piece. The Pole called —Heaven
knows what; both captains gazed
puzzled for a few seconds at
the ram’s-head on the coin, then
both burst into excited yapping.
Twenty minutes later I had ex-
plained, I hope, that the ram’s-
head meant tail. Then the
word “tail” had them puzzled.
We went from “tale” to “story,”
to “yarn”; in the end we were
among wool-fibres in Polish. We
were obviously getting nowhere.
Desperate, I pointed to where
my own tail would be were I
a simian. One of the Poles came
over and helpfully hitched up
the back of my shorts.
With rising choler I touched
my own head and then shook it.
The French skipper said “Oui —
malade!” And his whole team
burst into laughter. By that time
I’d forgotten who had won the
toss, so I put the ball on the
centre-line and pointed to the
right boot of the Polish captain.
All went well for the first few
minutes of play, and then a
breach of the rules necessitated
my first use of the whistle.
Digging a heel into the turf
and pivoting in the approved
fashion, I ordered a scrum,
tossing 'the ball to the Polish
half-back. He deliberately flung
it in among the feet of his own
second row, so I awarded a
penalty against his side. Uproar
followed. The Poles swarmed
around, yabbering away nineteen
to the dozen. Waving them back
imperiously I opened the Polish-
English dictionary. Turning
swiftly to the word I sought, 1
found the Polish equivalent was
something comprising about four
z’s, three t’s and a few k’s.
Realising the hopelessness of
trying to pronounce it, I pointed
to it. The next I didn’t know
was that I was being treated by
the ambulance fellow —I found
later that the word I had too-
hurriedly turned up was “scum.”
As I came to and staggered to
my feet I again ordered the
penalty against the Poles, upon
which the French skipper rushed
up and kissed me heartily. It
was like being rubbed down with
S 2 sandpaper—he was the team’s
hooker and had left three days’
growth on to assist him in raking
against his vis-a-vis.
What with tearing up and
down the field humping three
dictionaries which weighed an
aggregate of about eight pounds,
at “lemons” they had to put me
in an oxygen-tent to restore my
pulmonary processes, while two
masseurs worked furiously on
me. Also, I had lost so much
weight the elastic in my shorts
had to be taken in or they would
have fallen off.
Shortly after the interval it be-
came necessary to explain a
“dead-ball” ruling. Followed 10
minutes of furious searching
through the dictionaries, but all
attempts to make it clear to both
sides was hopeless. In the end I
rushed off, got a lily and came
back and put it across the ball,
making assurance doubly sure by
sketching a skeleton on the
leather. It worked.
Two tries and 18 fights later
the Polish five-eighth got his
opposite-number in the ear with
a beautiful side-kick, I pointed
towards the pavilion and sternly
ordered him off. He pretended
not to understand. By that time
it was dusk, what with the lost
time over language difficulties,
and they had to bring out a torch
so I could let him know what I
meant.
I found the Polish equivalent
for “ordering off” at last —it was
“myzckltxclmz-czktc.” I roared
it out —at least as close as I
could get to it. It was an idiotic
thing to have done.

jaw would be right in a week or

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Remembering the old days of pro-
prietary clubs, with whom the only
consideration involved in deciding if
a scheduled meeting should be pro-
ceeded with or abandoned was the
question of whether sufficient cash
customers would turn up to represent
a profit, one must approve, in general
principle, the Sydney Turf Club’s
policy erf trying to carry on with
meetings if it is in any way possible
to do so. However, this policy can
be overdone; it was on Saturday.
Although towards last weekend
gales and storms blitzed not only
Sydney but most of coastal N.S.W.,
the S.T.C. came out with the usual
blithe Friday afternoon assurances
that “most of the rain missed Canter-
bury,” and after an inspection of the
track early on Saturday morning it
was decided to proceed with the
meeting. If the track was fit for
racing at that stage it certainly wasn’t
after a morning of further heavy rain,
and the running of the first couple
of races should have been sufficient
to show that this was so. However,
the meeting proceeded until, after the
running of the sixth of the scheduled
eight events, the jockeys themselves,
showing more nous than anyone else
present seemed to be able to muster,
decided and expressed their opinion
that the track was not safe for racing.
In point of fact it scarcely looked
.safe for swimming. The stewards
seconded the motion, and the
remainder of the programme was
abandoned. It should never have
been begun.
A number of people, including a
few trainers who should have known
better, were loudly critical of the
decision to conclude the meeting. It
would have been interesting to see
the response of these grandstand
critics to a suggestion that if they
felt all that enthusiastic they might
care to substitute for the regular
riders for the last couple of events.
We fancy there would have been few
accepters.
Owner V. J. Byrnes, who brought
the crack mare De La Salle from the
obscurity of country meetings to beat
the best in the land at Randwick and
elsewhere, on Saturday produced
another likely-looking bargain horse
in the three-year-old gelding All
Jeep. A son of The Jeep-Pharaoh’s
Daughter, All Jeep was bought at the
1949 Sydney yearling sales for 270
guineas. He has won 10 races at
country meetings in the north-western
districts of N.S.W., and won Satur-
day’s Mixed so easily that he

With Grand National weights
issued last week, form students a
Caulfield on Saturday thought that
they would be able to really settle
down to the serious business of trying
to pick the big double, but, as it
happened, results were not altogether
enlightening.

Of the other runners who had been
fancied for the Wanda Steeple,
Tanakee lost his rider, Faunus finished
a very distant fourth and Benarca
struggled along behind Faunus. The
handicapper seems more than to have
Benarca’s measure; it’s a pity to see
a good, honest performer reduced to
mediocrity by crushing weights,
...
The Toolambool Hurdle brought to
light much more promising National
form than was sighted in. the Steeple.
The Hellespont gelding Tyrian started
favorite, and gave his supporters a
splendid run for their money before
being just touched off by Fairy Fable
(J. Kennedy) right on the post. Tyrian
had gone to the front half-a-mile
from home, and, jumping boldly, had
looked the winner at the turn; if
anything over-confidence may possibly
have contributed a mite to his defeat.
However, the even more impressive
trial with an eye to the Grand
National Hurdle was staged by The
Feline. Better known as a ’chaser,
and having his first run over the
battens in quite a time. The Feline
was palpably short of condition, but
he hung on very well to finish third,
“You can't blame me, dad —schools aren't so good
as when you were a boy."
a bare length behind the other pair.
The Feline will be very much at home
over the three-miles journey of the
National, and could take a lot of
beating; he is quite tolerably handi-
capped at 10.11 in the big race.
Third prize of £lOO, incidentally,
took The Feline’s total winnings to
£14,215—£24 more than credited to
the great Moss Trooper, who pre-
viously held the record for the amount
of stakes won by a jumper in Aus-
tralia. That, of course, is merely an
item of curiosity for the record-
books; with due respect to The
Feline’s undoubted merits, stake-win-
nings provide no comparison of the
respective merits of horses racing two
decades apart. The Feline’s principal
wins have been a National Steeple and
two Great Eastern Steeples. Moss
Trooper won the National Steeple,
National Hurdle, Australian Steeple
and two Australian Hurdles. As well,
he three times filled minor placings in
the National Steeple, once in the Aus-
tralian Steeple and once also in the
National Hurdle.
For the 12-furlongs Richmond
Handicap Milford and Durham, who
have clashed and finished fairly close
together more than once recently,
were brought together by the handi-
capper at level weights—B.9 apiece.
But Milford on the day proved
decisively the better, a result antici-
pated by the majority of punters, who
sent Milford out hot favorite at
9 to 4. Ridden by W. Williamson,
Milford gave his backers more than
a spot of anxiety; at the half-mile
he was ahead of only one of the 11
runners. However, Williamson’s wait-
ing tactics proved soundly judged. He
had moved up to be within reason-
able shooting distance of the leaders
turning for home, and a well-timed
run over the final furlong saw Milford
score by one-and-a-quarter lengths
from Durham, with Glenvue third.

“Pass-it”: Under atrocious playing
conditions at Sydney Showground last
Saturday the New Zealand Rugby
Union tourists, the All Blacks, beat
N.S.W. 24-3 after leading 15.0 at
half-time. The visitors quickly had
the game in their grasp when, with
three penalty goals and a fine indi-
vidual try by winger Jarden, they went
to a 12-0 lead. Victory for the All
Blacks was further assured at this
stage when it was obvious that
N.S.W. was going to be handicapped
by injuries suffered by three of its
players.
Although they were admittedly
hampered by the condition of the
ground, and despite their having
scored five tries to one against what
was virtually an Australian Test
team, this All Black combination is
not as impressive as its predecessors,
and present observer ventures the
opinion that Australia has a very
much better chance of winning the
first Test next Saturday than might
seem the case. Last Saturday the
N.S.W. forwards won more than their
share of the ball from the scrums and
lineouts, and, with the inclusion of
lineout forward Shehadie and hooker
Cotterell in the Australian team, indi-
cations are that the All Blacks will
see even less of the ball in the Test.
The New Zealanders will no doubt
have the edge on the locals in the
loose rucks, which provide excellent
scoring opportunities, but, from the
little that could be glimpsed in Satur-
day’s game, their inside backs haven’t
the ability to fully capitalise on this
advantage and clinch the tries half-
made by their forwards. With the
exception of winger Jarden and half-
back Steel, both of whom moved with
a distinctive air of real class, the New
Zealand backs, although sound, did
not impress in their ability to make
and finish tries. To threaten the
Australian defences they would need
more of the ball than present scribe
anticipates they will receive on Satur-
day.
In contrast we have, in Burke,
Too’th, Gudsell, Solomon and Davis,
men who are capable of developing
tries from set play, and, with plenty
of the ball from this source, they
will have an opportunity of exploiting
every manoeuvre they know. N.S.W.
did not show anything of this
on Saturday, mainly because the
abnormal weather conditions panicked
them into kicking: five-eight Tooth
kicked almost every ball he laid hand
to, and, he didn’t kick well —mostly
either too far or complete mis-kicks.
On the few occasions that he did bring
off a good ’un nothing came of it,
because whoever told Tooth it was
good wet-weather tactics to kick the
ball through forgot to tell the rest of
the team to chase it; consequently
the New Zealand full-back had ample
time to recover from any errors he
made. In contrast, whenever they
kicked through, every New Zealander
bustled through after the ball whole-
heartedly, and they were rewarded
with three tries.

Only percentages separate “the
four” in the V.F.L., Collingwood
holding top place by 2.4 from Rich-
mond, Geelong and Fitzroy next. All
have won six of the eight games
played, and the next four —Essendon,
North Melbourne, Footscray and
South Melbourne —have four each. It
is something to find Melbourne at the
bottom with only one game to its
credit. Qn Saturday Richmond might
have got a clear lead but that Fitz-
roy’s centre line was too good, and
in the final stages the Tigers were
run off their feet; Fitzroy, 12.16 to
9.12. Geelong visited Footscray and
collected the bacon by 11.11 to 9.5
with neat forward play, and at
Essendon the Dons found Coleman’s
six goals a heartener in their 15.13-
12T7 win over St. Kilda. Game of the
day was at Carlton, where 30,000-odd
saw Collingwood get the verdict against
the Blues, 9.13-7.11, after a hard day’s
work. North romped around with
Melbourne to collect 14.9 to 6.12,
and South Melbourne sported simi-
larly with Hawthorn to gather 12.14
to 7.11.

In what one facetious commentator
described as the world middle-aged
championship in New York last week,
Joe Louis showed that he is at least
still capable of winning at weight-
for-age by knocking out Lee Savold
in the sixth round of a scheduled 15-
rounder. Louis now claims the world
heavyweight championship, of which
the British Boxing Board iof Control
had recognised Savold as the holder.
Joe, in his heyday, would have cared
precious little what the British Board
may have thought about the heavy-
weight title situation.

Northern Weeds.
“Oxo”: At a conference at
Longreach (Q.) attention was
drawn to the spread of
noogoora. - burr, rubber - vine,
Chinee apple and prickly acacia,
and disappointment was ex-
pressed at replies received from
the C.5.1.R.0. and the State
Lands Department to requests
fpr information on how to tackle
them.
In regard to rubber-vine, the
C.5.1.R.0. claimed that it
appeared to be confined to a
small area, and the council was
fully occupied “investigating
the destruction of noxious weeds
of major economic importance.”
The State Lands Department
advised that arsenic pentoxide
might prove effective against
rubber-vine ; but where does one
get pentoxide today?
It was stated that around
Charters Towers it was almost
impossible to get cattle en route
to meatworks through rubber-
vine and Chinee apple, and that
at Nonda (northern railway line)
cattle could not be driven
through the prickly acacia
(mimosa bush).
S. J. Collins, of Einasleigh,
stated that noogoora-burr had
destroyed 50 per cent, of the
river-flats in the Gulf from a
grazing point of view. As for
rubber-vine, one could go down
any of the Gulf streams and
see it so thick after a good
season on the river-flats and
“ Crikey! I told them not to use green timber."
river islands that it was impos-
sible to get cattle out of the
river-bed once they got in.
C. D. Leake, of Hughenden,
said that hundreds of thousands
of acres of the best sheep
country in North Queensland
were becoming infested with
noogoora-burr, but apparently
the C.5,1.R.0.’s attitude was to
wait until thousands of miles of
river frontages had been ruined
by pests before it considered
such weeds of “major economic
importance.”
It was decided to ask the
C.5.1.R.0. that, in the event of
its not being able to conduct
investigations into methods of
destroying some of the more
serious noxious plants, particu-
larly ia the wool-growing areas,
it advocates making money
available to some other body,
such as the biological section of
the Queensland Lands Depart-
ment, to do it.
From Bd. to 140 d.
“C.S.”: In 1931-32 average
price for wool was 8.6 d. a
pound, probably the lowest aver-
age in the past 50 years. Esti-
mated average for 1950-51 is
140 d., probably the highest many
of us will see. In its 62nd
Annual Review, just published,
Winchcombe, Carson, Ltd., note
that wool sold at Australian
auctions in the year ended June
30, 1950, realised an estimated
£A6SO million, the previous
highest total being that for the
year before, £A286.628 million.
Writers of this Review over
the years have usually been most
restrained in their language. This
year such words as “un-
paralleled,” “phenomenal” and
“unique” testify to the —er —un-
paralleled effect of the wool
market on the people who handle
the stuff,
Winchcombes, as usual, give
a very comprehensive outline of
the year’s trading, seasonal con-
ditions, qualities and so forth in
the wool, fat-stock and meat in-
dustries, and this time reminds
woolgrowers that Marshall Aid
to Europe, enabling Continental
woollen mills to get going
quickly after the war, was a
decided factor in creating the
sustained demand and rising
prices for wool.
After surveying pretty well
every aspect of the pastoral in-
dustry, the position of wool pro-
duct i o n and consumption
throughout the world, the impact
of artificial fibres on the textile
trade, and other things, the firm
concludes that “every reason
exists for cheerfulness in regard
to the future sale of pastoral
products,” and suggests that the
best way to combat the challenge
of artificials is to grow more
and better wool.
The firm doesn’t like the look
of the meat markets from the
production angle, pointing out
that slaughter of young cattle is
not being evened up by increased
herds, and that a growing popu-
lation and local demand is pull-
ing down exports of beef,
mutton and lamb. It urges
strongly increased breeding of
fat lambs, sheep and cattle in
“better-rainfall areas.”
All those interested in the
pastoral industry should ask the
firm for a copy.
Learner Shearers.
“Gem”: Training shearers
(B. 23/5/’51)? What’s wrong
with swinging the 10,000-strong
Junior Farmer Movement on to
the job? A leading N.S.W.
shearing contractor put it this
way: The award provides that
a learner’s earnings shall not be
less than he would have received
had he been employed for the
same period as an adult shed-
hand. “The opportunity is there
for the ambitious. If a learner
finds he can increase his tally
he can go ahead and do so, the
reward is there for him.”
Shearing projects and com-
petitions are an essential part of
the work of overseas young-
farmer movements, but not so
here. The N.S.W. Junior
Farmer organisation admits
members up to 25 years old, and
covers tuition in such subjects
as sheep- and wool-growing,
beef-cattle raising, seed-collec-
tion, beekeeping, lucerne and
potato production and tree-
planting. Of late the executive
has added pasture-improvement
and tractor maintenance ; shear-
ing could be another.
Pastoralists have in the past
been quite willing to make their
properties available to groups of
40 and 50 junior farmers for
field days and demonstrations;
maybe they’d be willing to have
a little free shearing done dur-
ing the weekend.
To Bum or Not to Burn.
“Agric”: “Cattle do not like
rank grass any more than
humans like rank old lettuce
plants which have gone to seed,”
said JD. V. Wagner, a
Gayndah (Q.) grazier. C.5.1.R.0.
officers who oppose burning-off
might be right in theory, he said,
but the methods for pasture-im-
provement which they advocated
just did not work out in
practice. Even if such factors
as the loss of nitrogen by burn-
ing meant that graziers would
eventually have to top-dress their
paddocks, he was convinced
they had no alternative to burn-
ing-off if they wished to fatten
cattle in his district.
Dead, rank grass would not
fatten them, and sometimes
would not even keep them alive.
For this reason a saying was
current among practical graziers
that it is “Better to burn the
grass than to burn the cattle.”
Beating Potato-scab.
“Hortus”: Experiments in
England have proved that rape-
growing prior to a potato crop
is a preventive against scab
caused by eelworms. These
nematodes attack the potato
tubers, form blister-like lumps
and cause a scabby surface when
the lumps break.
It’s the mustard-oil content of
the rape that does the trick. As
eelworms also attack cabbage,
cauliflower, spinach, lettuce,
beans, peas, tomato, carrot and
parsnip, it looks like a new era
for rape cultivation.
It’s an easy crop to grow.
The seed is cheap, and takes less
time to become of feeding value
than any other crop. It also
stands a dry spell owing to its
deep-rooting system.
Sow in autumn 21b. to 41b. of
seed an acre. Soil must be fairly
rich. It’s a good idea to sow
after a wheat crop, especially if
sheep have been allowed to feed
on the stubble.
In the Old Country old rotted
cow-manure conserved in heaps,
collected from cowsheds during
the winter housing of the
animals, is always used.
Some growers advjse putting
seed in the manure-box with
super, and letting the two run
through together. If you do
this, stop now and again and
give the mixture a shuffle.
In about two months after
sowing rape should normally be
ready. After feeding down and
being given a slight spell, it pro-
duces a vigorous second growth.
This is handy as it generally
comes along just at a time when
green fodder is wanted.
Don’t let the surface between
drills harden, as rape must be
able to obtain moisture at all
times. Nothing makes soil-
moisture evaporate like a caked
surface.
Preventing Cane Fires.
“Plane Creek”: Fire danger
in the Queensland cane-country
is serious this year. There’s
always plenty of grass for burn-
ing at harvest’s end in this heavy-
rainfall belt, but last year the
weather was too wet for burn-
ing.
Greatest danger is in those
places where sizeable belts of
scrub or grass - land occur
amongst farms. Fleavy rains
last year and early this year en-
couraged a dense growth of
grass up to 6ft. high; this will
become tinder after a few frosts
and dry days.
Most of these areas, especially
of grass, can be burned off
safely. Choose a calm, dull
afternoon and gradually take the
fire round the area, starting on
the side to which the wind is
blowing. The important point
is to keep calm and work
slowly. It’s easy to beat out a
bit of fire in half-green grass.
A few stirrup - pumps and
buckets of water in the party
will make the job very easy.
If it isn’t possible to burn-off
grass patches before they dry
out all you can do is prepare
good, wide firebreaks between
the grass and your crop.
When cane-cutting starts I
make a point, where possible,
of cutting the crop on dangerous
sides first. This makes a safety-
belt or supplementary firebreaks.
The same plan can be followed
when cutting cane for planting
provided the trash is soon
burned.
Many fires start in cane-fields
at midday from smouldering
logs, stumps or trees. Risk is
great in new cultivations. Walk
round the block, looking for
smouldering objects, after a
night burn of cane. It isn’t hard
to find smouldering stuff then,
since the dew increases any
smoke rising. Look up at the
branches as well as the butts of
trees. Decaying messmate-trees
start more fires than others.
Swarm-control.
“A-Jay”: To be successful
swarm-control depends mainly
on an abundant supply of drawn
worker combs, colonies headed
by young queens, the apiarist’s
preparations always in advance
of the wants of the bees, and
reasonably good weather for the
field-bees.
Good worker combs can be
obtained by inserting two or
three frames of foundation on
strong colonies at every extrac-
tion during a good honey flow.
Store the drawn combs that are
replaced and guard them from
moths and mice by fumigation.
They can be used to make up
spare hives.
Nuclei made up in the autumn
and headed by young queens can
be used in swarm - control,
colony-building and queen-re-
placement. Pay special attention
to breeding-colonies used for
drones and queens.
About six weeks before breed-
ing begins stimulate these
colonies by feeding. If no in-
coming pollen is available, pro-
vide frames containing it and
scrape away the honey cover-
ing so the bees will avail them-
selves of it. Place it adjacent to
the brood-nest and see that
empty storage combs are close
to the brood-nest.
Give the colonies a warm
honey-syrup, broken down with
about 30 p.c. of water. Feed at
dusk to avoid robbing. A 71b.
honey-tin with a few holes
punched in the lid and inverted
in an empty super above the
colony makes a good feeder. A
piece of jute sacking cut to fit
over the brood-chamber and
round the feeder will prevent the
THE WEATHER
By Inigo Jones
The June sun developed a strong activity of spots, and
the leading group showed a characteristic rotary form
which produced an immediate response in rains in West
Australia and a cyclonic storm on the N.S.W. coast. The
group then subsided to some extent, but may give some
further rain shortly.
It is followed by another large, complex group $o big
that it will probably give further and very widespread rains
in June, after which there is likely to be a cold, frosty period
toward the end of the month, then further rains along the
south of the continent.

■
TO THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY
There have been great changes in
the making of the nation's furniture
in recent years. To meet price
demands hand-made is giving place
to machine-made.
Last year 1,457 establishments
which employed 17,307 men and
women turned out £20,949,000 worth
of furniture, and paid £5,860,000 in
wages.
Because furniture is slow-moving
stock many a maker finds his banker
a useful aid in the ups and downs of
demand.
This Bank provides a full banking
service for concerns in all industries.
Its Managers are always glad to
discuss details of this service with
those desiring it.

warm air escaping from the
cluster.
If the colonies are storing too
much surplus, regulate the sup-
ply or remove the full combs to
other colonies, and insert empty
storage combs in their place. Be
sure to keep up the feeding.
Insert a plentiful supply of
drone comb in the drone-build-
ing colonies to ensure an abun-
dance of the right-aged drones in
advance of the normal drone
population.
Feed the drone-r earing
colonies during the presence of
virgin queens. Use warm honey-
syrup with 50 p.c. water.
Drones with a full stomach are
forced to fly to void themselves
and they take advantage of all
possible flying weather. The
noise they create tempts the
virgins to flight, and many mat-
ings occur that would not occur
otherwise, especially in sheltered
mountain country.
Pre-calf Feeding.
“Myrrhee”; It pays to feed a
cow well in the dry period prior
to calving. If she’s in poor con-
dition, without reserves of fat
and protein built up during her
pre-lactation period, she can’t be
expected to produce within
gallons of a cow that’s had
ample pre-lactation feeding.
A poor cow, after calving, is
physically incapable of eating
enough food to maintain herself
and produce enough milk to
make her profitable. If she’s not
on first-class pasture, give her
51b. of concentrates per day for
six weeks before she calves, in
addition to a full feed of good
roughage.
If feeding is delayed until
after she calves there’s a risk of
her suffering from digestive up-
sets, as she comes straight from
poor feed on to a ration contain-
ing a high proportion of con-
centrates.
Portable Poultry-houses.
“C.A.A.”: The practice is the
equivalent of controlled graz-
ing ; poultry are moved from
one piece of ground before they
have fouled it too heavily. The
land benefits because in 12
months 100 birds will produce
equal to 4cwt. of sulphate of
ammonia, 3cwt. of super, and i
cwt. of sulphate of potash.
Steep, rough country is un-
suitable. For each movable
pen allow 4 sq. ft. per bird and
the roosting portion should
allow a minimum of a square
foot of floor space. Where
perches are used allow Sin. for
light breed birds and lOin. each
for heavy breeds.
Self-feeders for Pigs.
“Beau Forte”: The pig is
especially well adapted for self-
feeding. It does not over-eat,
and, as a result, does not suffer
digestive disturbances. With
self-feeding, pigs are able to bal-
ance their own rations when
allowed a choice of various
foods.
Self-feeding gives the smaller
pigs a lot better chance to get
their share of the feed. Self-fed
pigs generally gain faster and
require less feed for each pound
of grain than do hand-fed pigs,
even when the latter are regu-
larly fed well-balanced rations.
If pigs are fed at irregular
hours and given whatever feed
is most handy the advantages of
self-feeding will be much greater.
Hints for the Farm.
“W. Court”: When laying
new floors for pig-sties try saw-
dust concrete ; it is warmer than
the sand-cement mixture. In-
formation on its preparation is
put out by State Agricultural
Departments. Ordinary concrete
should always be boarded over
in corners where the pigs sleep
or they’re likely to get chilis or
pneumonia.
“Plane Creek”: Brit i sh
medical authorities have seized
on molasses as a remedy for
nutritional diseases. They
obtained a few drums from N.Q.
mills last year, and are anxious
to get more. In the North it’s
widely used to increase the food-
value and palatability of stock-
foods, though a great amount
goes into the making of power-
alcohol at A.N.P.A.’s distillery
at Sarina.
“Big Billy”: Best way to store
oats is in bulk in a galvanised-
iron tank. One which will hold
2000 gal. of water will hold
about 100 bags of grain. An-
other good way is to empty the
oats on the floor of a shed or old
house, which must be mouse-
proof. A safe reserve to work
on is 80 bags of oats for every
100 sheep.
“Sundowner”: Defrost the re-
frigerator regularly. Open door
as infrequently as possible;
keep it as much as possible at
normal temperatures setting
(between 40 and 50deg. F.);
don’t put hot foods in it; use
for perishables only.
“Billjim”: One way to get
rid of boxthorn is to cut the
main stems as near ground-level
as possible and put an ounce of
common salt on the cut surfaces
of the stumps. Burn top growth
when dry.
“C.A.A.”: Best method of
dealing with bracken-fern infes-
tation is ploughing, sowing the
area with adequately fertilised
pasture, damaging regrowth
fronds with judicious grazing
(feet of stock do appreciable
damage to fronds), and rolling
or beating down with wire
switches.
“C.S.”: Sydney R.A.S. maize
prize in the Inland Division this
year went to R. Menchin,
Wilbertree Flat, Mudgee, whose
crop of Sterling Hybrid may go
120 bushels, not as high as the
Gundagai crop grown by
Robertson and McDonald (130)
but better in general appearance.
All three placed crops were
hybrids. On the Northern
Tablelands a hybrid again took
the prize, this time for H. N.
Kempton, of Glen Innes, and the
old variety. Hickory King, was
second. It belonged to J. T.
Weir, of Tenterfield, and was
heavily outyielded by the winner.

Oastlereagh St., Sydney, N.S.W, AnstnUft,
“Don’t you worry about him,”
Andy soothed. “Nugget, he’s
strong like y’ know. This wind,
she don’t hurt him.” He took
the glass from her hand and
pushed her towards Mrs.
Velaspi. “You go along with
her and get some dry clothes
on. This wind, she’ll be back
soon. More stronger, like y’
know.”
'"THE returning wind, as Andy
* had predicted, came “more
stronger.” It raged and screamed
around the house while the
Velaspis and their visitor sat in
the front parlor. Barbara,
dressed in one of Mrs. Velaspi’s
black frocks, kept staring from
Andy’s complacent face to the
bright electric-light bulb over-
head. That light was her
greatest comfort. No wind
could blow it out and leave her
shivering in the terrifying dark-
ness. There was comfort, too,
to be derived from the expres-
sion of smug assurance on
Andy’s face as he waved a proud
arm around the room and bel-
lowed :
“Strong, eh? She don’t blow
this place down,”
Opposite him Mrs. Velaspi
sat with hands clasped in her
lap. Impossible to tell what she
was thinking, for her eyes were
downcast and her plain old face
completely devoid of expres-
sion.
The electric - light flickered,
then danced crazily, drawing all
three pairs of eyes upwards.
Water was seeping through the
ceiling, spreading rapidly over
the white surface and dripping
to the carpet in several places.
Even as they scared the ceiling
bulged alarmingly. It sagged
downwards, threatening to col-
lapse on their heads until some
freakish air current sucked it
skyward for the gale to tear
apart and hurl from their vision.
Stripped of roof and ceiling,
the room was a swirling vortex
of wind and rain. Overhead the
still-burning light swung in
dizzying circles against the
framework of bare rafters. Andy
sat bolt - upright in his arm-
chair, staring upwards with an
expression of awed disbelief.
His house, his beautiful strong
house, was being torn to pieces!
The roof was gone, plucked off
as easily as one might lift the
lid from a saucepan. One wall
was bulging threateningly. It
was impossible! It couldn’t be
true!
The swinging light splintered
itself against an overhead beam
and the two women fled from
the darkened room. It was
strange that without being able
to distinguish one feature of the
house they should come together
under the big double-bed in the
next room.
Hours later, when the wind
had fallen to a moderate gale
and the first grey light of dawn
showed through the rain, Barbara
crept out. Except that most of
its roof had gone, Andy’s house
still stood. It offered some pro-
tection from driving rain, but
the girl left it without regret.
More than protection, more
than anything in the world, she
wanted to find Nugget and know
that he was safe. He must be
safe. It must be, as Andy had
said, that even a cyclone couldn’t
hurt him. He was so strong.
He’d be down at the inlet guard-
ing the boat, their boat, and she
must go to him.
KJ UGGET was at that moment
* wading across the inlet. He
was safe, but he was far from
strong. Blood oozing from a
deep gash in his head was
mingling with the rain that
streamed down his face. His left
arm, broken above the elbow,
was tucked inside his sodden
shirt. He had no idea how long
he’d lain unconscious under the
tree. A fair while, he guessed,
for day was now breaking. He
could see the launch still moored
to the fallen tree, but he
scarcely glanced at it. Across
the inlet he could just dis-
tinguish a tangled mass of fallen
timber. The few trees still stand-
ing were gaunt pitiful skeletons,
their shattered branches stripped
bare of leaves but festooned in-
stead by waving strands of sea-
weed tossed up by the gale.
But Nugget was not interested
in seaweed on tree-tops. It is
doubtful . whether he would
have been even mildly interested
at the sight of his launch perched
up there. Although he was
afraid to think what he’d find
there, he wanted only to get
back to the township. The house
would be damaged for sure, pos-
sibly wrecked completely. He
was a bit of a wreck himself, he
thought ruefully, as he wiped
the blood from his face with
his one good arm. But those
things were only trifles. Houses
could be rebuilt, broken arms
and heads would mend. Noth-
ing mattered so long as Barb
had come through safely.
It was full daylight when he
reached the township, a cheer-
less grey daylight of wind-driven
clouds and streaming rain—a
fitting background for this scene
of utter desolation. Yesterday
this had been a flourishing
township ; today not one house
remained intact. Sheets of roof-
ing-iron and lengths of timber
were thrusting up through the
water in the flooded street or
resting high among the torn
limbs of trees. Telegraph-poles
lay at odd drunken angles with
bedding and all manner of per-
sonal articles caught in their
tangled wires. Of Nugget’s own
house all that remained was a
floor and a few splintered studs.
As a pathetic reminder that this
had once been a dwelling where
people lived, the kitchen-stove
stood upright and unharmed.
Nugget wasted no time ex-
amining the ruins; he made
straight for Andy’s place. Bar-
bara would be sheltering here,
and this house had at least with-
stood the blow better than any
other. When no one answered
his knock he walked in, calling
his wife’s name as he moved
from one roofless room to
another.
In the front parlor he found
Mrs. Velaspi sitting with her
face buried in her hands, rock-
ing to and fro, utterly heedless
of the rain that beat down on
her. Opposite her Andy sat in
his big armchair, still staring up
at the bare rafters, an expres-
sion of amazed disbelief on his
face. The stone demijohn lay
on its side at his feet, red wine
staining the sodden carpet. It
took Nugget some time to rea-
lise that Andy was dead. He
looked so lifelike sitting there
with the gusts of wind blowing
his great moustache in and out,
just as if he was breathing
heavily. On the carpet behind
his chair lay the heavy beam
that must have killed him.
Nugget shook Mrs. Velaspi
and asked “Where’s Barb?
Didn’t she come over here?”
She lifted a tear-stained face,
shook her head and burst into
a torrent of words.
It was useless to question her.
Nugget suddenly remembered.
He couldn’t understand one
word she said, and she couldn’t
tell him any more than poor old
Andy could. He’d have to find
some of the other neighbors. He
remembered now that he’d seen
quite a number of people splash-
ing about amongst the wreckage
of their houses as he came down
the street. Someone must know
where Barb was.
HE saw her as he recrossed
the street. She must have
been down at the inlet looking
for him. Possibly they’d passed
each other in the half-light
among the fallen timber, for she
was coming from that direction,
picking her way slowly through
the wreckage.
He shouted: “Hey there,
Barb! Hey!”
She looked up, recognised his
sturdy figure and ran towards
him. And despite pain that
would have prevented most men
from walking, Nugget ran to
meet her. His arm flapped awk-
wardly inside his shirt, but he
scarcely noticed it. Nor did
Barbara notice the stinging lash
of the rain or the debris that
lay in her path. Whatever else
the cyclone had done it had not
destroyed them. They were
young, and alive, and they were
coming together.

What is the subjunctive, and how
is it used ?
The subjunctive designates that
mood of a verb which expresses state
or action as provisional, contingent
or dependent, rather than as a fact;
it is usually introduced by if, that or
lest. The imperative also comes
under the heading. Examples in
common use are “Manners be
hanged!” “Come what may,” “Be
that as it may,” “If he were here
now.” It is very easy to err when
constructing a sentence beginning as
does the last-named example, and
many writers do fall into error. Main
points to watch are that the sentence
must not refer to time past (the
occasion referred to must be imagin-
ary), and that the main clause must
have, as verb, “would be,” “should
be” or “were.” Here are two correct
examples: “If he were here now he
would be able to show you the
correct way,” and “Were that true
there were no more to say.” Neither
sentence refers to the past. This
one does, and so is wrong: “It were
just and fitting that at such a time
the Prime Minister acted as he did.”
This clearly refers to a certain occa-
sion in the past—“lt was just and
fitting” it should have been. The
subjunctive is gradually disappearing
from English, and most applications
of its use should be left to the poets.

Fumigation is the only effective
means. If this is impossible, spray

How to remove iron in solution
from household water?
If the iron is in the form of ferrous

removed by bringing the water in
contact with the air by passage over

through a sand filter. If the iron
exists in the form of ferrous sulphate
the water should be treated with
slaked lime and clarified by sedimen-
tation or filtering.

What are the characteristics of the
impressionist school of painters, and
were their earliest works readily
accepted by the critics?
The work of the impressionist
school aroused a great deal of con-
troversy and criticism when it was
first exhibited. Its chief subjects were
landscapes and outdoor or semi-out-
door scenes, viewed at varying times
of the day, with emphasis on effects
of light and color and executed in a
hasty, “sketchy” technique intended
to bring out the pattern of the whole,
as seen by the painter at a particular
moment, rather than details and a
formal composition. Leading impres-
sionist painters were Sisley, Pissarro,
Monet, Degas and Renoir.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4Jd. per line; all others 2|d. per line.
Price of Butter
No matter how distasteful it may be,
the fact remains that the dairying in-
dustry was largely founded on child
slavery, and was continued on these
lines for a long time. A family either
worked their own dairy or else worked
someone’s dairy on shares. Dad, Mum
and all the kids worked from dawn until
dark, and children learned to milk a
cow before they learned their ABC.
Even when the children were old
enough to leave school they remained
working for Dad, rarely getting any
regular wages. Of course they were
provided with food and clothing and a
few shillings pocket-money, but they
didn’t know what regular wages were.
In cases where farmhands were em-
ployed, the usual wage was about £1 a
week and keep.
Then came the war, and many of the
young people enlisted or else went into
factories and shops. For the first time in
their lives they collected regular
wages. Army pay was much better than
the farmhand ever received. When the
war ended, the dairyfarmer’s sons and
daughters were not eager to go back to
work on the dairy under the old con-
ditions, and paid farmhands soon found
bigger wages and better conditions in
cities and towns.
The dairyfarmer, to carry on, had to
pay higher wages for shorter hours, but
the price he received for his butter and
other products did not rise in proportion.
The result has been a serious decline in
dairying, a decline that will continue until
it is realised that the man on the land
cannot produce butter and other farm
products under 1951 conditions for prices
based on the old slavery conditions. It
just can’t be done. —W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
Egg Boards
A moment's thought should convince
“F.H.W.” (B. 16 /5/ ’5l) that to chill eggs
costs money; therefore the consumer
could not expect to get them at “spring-
flush” prices. “F.H.W.” should put some
form of “yardstick” on his conception
of prices—for instance, by halving present
prices and seeing if the result corres-
ponds with what was a fair thing in 1939.
His letter reread with that in mind will
largely answer itself. On this basis his
quoted price of 4s. Id. for eggs is about
right seeing that wheat (the basis of all
poultry feed) has advanced more than
100 per cent, since 1946. I thought !
made it clear that Egg Boards benefit the
consumer by ensuring that a good product
is available and egg famines are largely
avoided. ,
“F.H.W.” appears to be one of those
who accept price rises in secondary pro-
ducts much more readily than in primary
products. His gibe at the boards for ex-
horting the housewife to buy eggs just
when they are scarce is not supported by
fact. I have official data from the Egg
Producers’ Council showing that Press
advertisements were made only from
August, 195.0, to late February, 1951 —
during last year’s flush season.
Data from the same source disclose
that S.A. board charges last year ranged
from 2yd. to 3yd. (the cheapest of all
States), so “F.H.W.’s” memory does not
appear to serve him well there, either.
— D. Spencer (Tas.).
“Danger Ahead”?
The rocks ahead that “Cave” (B.
9/5/’5l) warns of are mirages, but the
course he would have us set would really
pile us up on the rocks. After all, the
immediate shortages of foodstuffs are
largely seasonal and temporary. Dairy
produce, eggs and some vegetables are
in short supply, but meat —eaten grossly
and wastefully in Australia at a price far
below world parity—and wheat are
assured for at least a decade. By that
time development in the safe rainfall
areas and the extension of irrigation will
have greatly increased the supply of
meat, and no doubt modern farming
practices and machinery will have
increased the productivity and area of
wheatlands.
“C.” begins with the old fallacy that
wool grows with little trouble to anyone
except the sheep. Many dairyfarmers
and others who have bought sheep at
high prices are going to find to their
sorrow just how false that is. Within a
year or two, mast of these mushroom
woolgrowers, having learnt that wool-
growing is a skilled occupation, and hav-
ing had their pockets hit by the slump in
prices, will be glad <to revert to the job
that (hey understand and for which their
land is most suitable.
“C.” admits that “the cocky is entitled
to change to the more remunerative field
if he can,’’ but then he denies it: “Because
one section of primary production is
booming, participants in the other
sections are hardly justified in hopping
in for their cut.” And , what gave him
the idea that in bad times the taxpayer
kept sheepfarmers on their farms?
Everyone should know that the wool-
grower has, to his eternal credit, built
up the biggest and most efficient industry
in Australia without one penny of Gov-
ernment aid. I know —I bought my first
mob of sheep in 1928 and regretted it
for the next 10 years.
“C.” blames—and here I am with , him
—Government interference with sources
of production for much of the trouble.
However, we part company very smartly
when he suggests taxation of wool
exports to give the city-dweller cheaper
butter and eggs. Why pull down a wool-
shed to build a henhouse? Another
form of Government interference will not
help matters. Far better to abolish all
the boards he instances and let demand
regulate the supply. Under the New
Deal the U.S.A. tried out “C.’s” idea of
subsidising farmers, and found itself
“Henry! Where did you put the cat’s meat?”
with thousands of tons of dried eggs and
other surplus farm products on its hands.
Hundreds of millions of the taxpayers’
dollars were paid to farmers to plough
in their crops. The same thing could
easily happen here.
Subsidies are not the solution. In-
creased mechanisation, electrification,
irrigation and vastly-increased scientific
research are the answers. Give the
farmers the tools, the water and the
knowhow and they will do the rest.
Besides, within the next decade develop-
ments in deep-freezing will probably
make practicable the storage of vast
quantities of what are at present perish-
able foodstuffs. Conway Seymour
(S.A.).
That Woolly Frankenstein
“Cave” (B. 9/5/’5l) is right, but he has
overlooked one or two factors which
should convince the farmer that he has a
responsibility to the general community
in the matter of providing a properly-
balanced quota of farm products, instead
of the present, apd increasingly lopsided,
production of wool.
Doesn’t the farmer remember the many
bounties and handouts of various kinds
which he has received from taxpayers in
past years? That largesse has been on
such a huge scale that the report of the
Rural Reconstruction Commission
emphasised that the payments constituted
“a considerable drain upon the taxable
capacity of the nation.”
Also, the wool cheque is unnecessarily
swollen by the absurd 25 per cent. London
exchange-rate—and who does the farmer
think pays for that, except the general
public?
Most certainly the cocky owes a debt
to the nation and, if he will not recognise
it, he should be made to. That is one
debt with which he can’t run to the
Farmers’ Debts Adjustment Board.
Wasn’t a high sales tax imposed on
makers of luxury goods in an effort to
drive them into more essential fields of
production? If that’s fair, it would also
be fair to stipulate that this wholesale
going-over to wool production be checked
and a quota fixed for the production of
other lines such as butter, milk, bacon,
eggs, cereals and all the other things
which farmers used to produce.
We have already the licensing of farms
for the growing of wheat —imposed by
the Government to avoid overproduction
of that cereal, which would have been to
the detriment of growers. No thought
there for the general public and the
chance of getting cheaper flour. The
same applies to sugarcane and other
crops.
No one likes compulsion, but to suit
the farmers’ ends we have had to submit
to those measures. So, in an effort to
preserve our internal economy, why not
have the licensing of mixed farms for
wool production conditional on some
other essential crops being produced?
The general taxpayer willingly assisted
the farmer when times for primary pro-
ducers were not so good, and it is high
time that he recognised that now he has
a chance to repay.— Harry the Horse
(Vic.).
The Skilled Worker
Professor Copland’s opinion that Aus-
tralia is unlikely to produce sufficient
engineers, doctors and teachers to serve
her expanding population will bear think-
ing on.
When one considers the current
shortage of skilled tradesmen.
electricians, fitters, mechanics and the
like, the whole question of a fair deal
for this group becomes a national
problem. When applications are called
for wharflaborers the supply far exceeds
the demand, and there is no lack of appli-
cants for the many comparatively well-
paid, unskilled laboring jobs, but the
hospitals are desperately short of trainee
nurses and Commonwealth Government
scholarships to universities go begging.
How many boys of 14 are going to
undertake the discipline and study of the
five to 10 years necessary to a
skilled apprenticeship or a university de-
gree, when in a few years they can be
earning, as unskilled laborers, almost as
much as their skilled bosses? Every leap
that the basic wage takes narrows the
margin between wages for the skilled and
unskilled worker.
Apparently Australia still lives in the
“pioneering” days when the population
was basically divided into landholders,
shopkeepers and “wages men.” Our
major political parties still represent
essentially those groups, and their think-
ing centres round the scramble for
“goods” and “land” on one hand and
“labor” —unskilled —on the other. None
gives the skilled worker and professional
worker his rightful place in supplying
service, both to the producer of goods
and to the laborer —their health, the
education of their children, the skilled
service to their tractors, their cars, their
radios, and the scientific advice they re-
quire for their flocks, their herds and
their crops.
As long as Australians refuse to com-
pare the services of one trained fitter or
one trained nurse, teacher, doctor or
engineer with the productivity of so many
acres of land, just so long will Australia
lack skilled tradesmen and professional
workers. And just so long will it remain
in the pioneering stage of development,
with landholders, shopkeepers and
laborers begging for skilled technicians
and professional workers from more en-
lightened countries.— Fair Go (Q ).
Planners Again
Sydney City Council has broken out
into a rash of town-planning schemes.
Starting off with Woolloomooloo, they
put up an airy £7-million plan aimed at
converting that densely-populated area
into a sort of garden suburb. Their pro-
posals aim at the demolition of homes at
present housing 5500 persons, of whom
they propose to rehouse 1400 in flats.
The rest of the district is to contain
tennis-courts and a community pub, to-
gether with a number of gardens. The
Lord Mayor says he hopes the rehousing
will commence by the end of this year.
He also comments blithely that flats and
houses elsewhere can house the ’Loo’s
present population.
Just what the particular denizens of
the ’Loo are going to say about that
would make interesting material for a
commentary on local government and
those who practise it.
Then the council lays out a glorified
Paddington, with a proposal to dispose
of more than 10,000 residents to
“elsewhere,” The council will erect
flats for the remainder, a civic
centre, a community centre, a community
pub, a post-office (which should be the
responsibility of the Commonwealth
Government, anyhow), a church hall
(which likewise should be the responsi-
bility of the particular denomination
whose church adjoins it) and an under-
ground car-park.
This proposed wholesale demolition of
living accommodation comes at a time
when N. S. Wales is needing 36,000 new
dwellings a year and is flat-out reaching
the 20,000-mark in completed homes,
leaving a deficit of 16,000 to be added to
last year’s deficit.
Production of building materials is
hopelessly behind demand and —with
the almost complete failure of Gov-
ernment transport services to cope with
transport and distribution of raw materials
—looks like getting further into arrears.
Also, Government works programmes
such as the Snowy River Scheme are
drawing on the scanty stocks of materials
and on the pool of labor.
And on top of this a City Planning
Authority comes to light with a scheme
aimed at dehousing several more
thousands of persons of a type not likely
to seek to buy their own homes else-
where, and who must, therefore, add to
the worries of the Housing Commission. —
Jindivick (N.S.W.).
Pills and Potions
The U.S.A. has the right idea in deal-
ing with quack remedies and patent-
medicine vendors who make extravagant
unsubstantiated claims for their nostrums,
and the recent suppression in the States
of certain forms of advertising is a lead
that could well be followed in Australia.
This country seems to be a happy
hunting-ground for charlatans. Patent
medicines claiming to cure all sorts of
ailments —some of which are recognised
as incurable by medication—are blatantly
advertised without let or hindrance.
They are a prolific source of profit to the
vendors and to the mediums accepting
the advertisements. Many quacks with-
out any recognised or accepted qualifica-
tions are allowed to exploit the sick and
ailing, even to the extent of diagnosis and
treatment by correspondence. And they
are within the law provided they don’t
adopt the title of doctor. Some news-
papers readily accept their advertisements.
One so-called remedy once contained
among various inert ingredients a drug
which had an established therapeutic
value. When some States banned that
particular drug its use was discontinued
in the remedy and nothing was substi-
tuted. Yet according to the advertise-
ments it still maintains its alleged curative
properties.
Another patent medicine based on a
very sound and well-proven medical
formula contained an extremely ex-
pensive but efficacious ingredient. That,
however, was withdrawn and an in-
finitely cheaper drug of doubtful thera-
peutic value substituted. But the price
did not come down — it went up about 25
per cent.
Qualified medical practitioners often
refrain from prescribing for many
maladies which patent medicines claim to
cure. And often enough, when doctors
do prescribe, they admit that it is merely
a psychological gesture —a recognition of
the pathetic faith of the average patient
in a “bottla medsun.” — Ajax CN.S.W.k

9th Australian Division at El Alamein. As a stirring novel of daring and
danger, sacrifice and sadism it will rank high in the worlds literature
of peace and war. Indeed, a provocative and stimulating piece of realist

ballad, with a sensitive musical note of
his own:
Lost light lingers on the Razor Back
While new men travel down an ancient
That leads to water and the floodgum trees
And the best stock campsite in the
Kimberleys.
Stockmen slumber under stars that shine
On the Fitzroy River and the Condamine,
Tired night-horses at the break of day
And grey smoke rising to a sky dawn-grey.
Vague tracks straining over soil, stone,
sand,
And a strange dog howling in the oldest
land, ' ■ '
And an old-time story that the stones could
tell
Of a Queensland river and a cattle bell.
Horsemen mounting and the mob’s away
(Dark dust rises from the Fitzroy clay)
Lead on, river, to the marsh-girt sea,
There’s a new sun rising over Kimberley.
Sorensen was successively a bush boy,
a shearer, a professional boxer and a
businessman-writer on country news-
papers. At all stages of his career he was
generally perplexed and often hurt by
literary criticism. This was not because
of any conviction of his own poetic
excellence, but because in his rugged
earlier schools genuine effort that was
understood was always appreciated and
encouraged. When he became involved
with men who presumably understood
poetry he thought that the same kindly
rule should prevail, and he never under-
stood very well a passion for polish.
Not being a fool, he realised early in
life that there were better judges of verse
than country editors who didn’t pay for
it, but right up to his troubled end he
enjoyed pleasing the uncritical people of
bush towns as much as he did the praise
of the erudite. As an unpoetic character
with a keen sense of the value of a pound
I spent a lot of time in the pre-War years
trying to convince Jack that he should
do more desk work. But he was a man
whose ideas tumbled out in phrases that
suited the mood of a ride or a walk, a
sunset or a memory, and not any rules
that somebody else had made. We some-
times argued among the vines at his
family’s vineyard and orchard at Maida
Vale, near Perth, with what he called
“the wine of the country” at our elbows,
and I never won. I gained more from
Jack than he ever got from me, and
perhaps the secret of a character that I
still find lovable and fascinating but a
little baffling is that he was by nature a
giver rather than a hoarder of what was
in his mind.
We used to make grand plans, and one
of them was for a barbecue we would
hold on his property when our friends,
who had already in 1942 been scattered
by the war, were back home to enjoy it.
But the old circle never got together
again, as old circles never do, and, as
Mary Durack suggests, the wait was too
long for Jack. One old friend, whom he
loved as well as any man, and a mother
he loved more, died. He began to suffer
the loneliness, the suspicions and the
fears that are known to few except the
poets who need people to talk to, not
just to write for.
The last time I saw Jack, about four
years ago, he had gone through a revolt
against war and then involvement in it,
and seemed to have got back to the
mood of earlier years. It struck him as
queer and fascinating that in all his
wanderings about Australia from his
native West he had never been to
Queensland, and he was going to write
some verses about it. In his Collected
Poems they appear under the title “The
Road to Queensland,” along with such
Bulletin pieces as “The Shemlock,”
“The Southbound Plane” and “The
Lights of Bayley-street.” But Jack never
got to Queensland, and Queensland is
the poorer for that.
He was a big man, only 42 when he
died, with a solid jaw and a sensitive
mouth, and fistic ability he had long
forgotten how to use on his own behalf,
but would always bring to the service of
a friend. He was an imperfect poet in
an age when poetry must be given in the
26 letters of the alphabet, without the
aid of facial expression and voice and
gesture. Such of his lines as ring with
natural beauty, even when caged in print,
make his Collected Poems worth buying,
and the whole, together with Mary
Durack’s foreword, makes up a rounded
picture of a man. He laughed among his
friends with a whole-souled merriment
that was apparently echoed, in his latter
years, by private misery at the other end
of the scale. He told Miss Durack
“repeatedly” that he hoped a. few of his
friends might remember him for his
verse. , ,
They will do so —and for a great deal
more of it than was ever put on paper.
