JERSEY.
TX/TTH an area of 45 square miles, the island of Jersey is the
largest of the Channel Islands, and this, the most southern of
the group, is only twelve miles from the French coast, although
politically the Channel Islands belong to Great Britain and form
part of the diocese of Winchester. The crown appoints a
lieutenant-governor and a bailiff, and the islanders have two partly
elected bodies, the States and the Royal Court. St. Helier, shelter-
ing under the massive granite ridge of Mont de la Ville, is Jersey’s
capital. The dominating feature of eastern Jersey is the massive
medieval castle of Mont Orgueil, reached by climbing 244 steps
from the village of Gbrey. As well as the ruins of Mont Orgueil
there are others at Grosnez which attract many visitors, as also do
the island’s several interesting old churches, notably St. Saviour’s.
The island has always been a favourite resort of English visitors
by reason of its sheltered bays, its bold and rugged cliffs, its
mysterious caves and the grandeur of its coastline.

A PRIDE OF PARTRIDGE.
A quick and guilty glance at the list of
nouns of assemblage in Eric Partridge’s
Usage and Abusage (Hamish Hamilton)
confirms one’s suspicion that the correct
title for this review would be “A Covey
of Partridge” ; “Pride” is for lions. And
then, since his list of “snob plurals” does
not favor too much use of the singular
for birds and animals when the plural
is meant, it should probably be altered to
“A Covey of Partridges.”
But it is a pity one cannot use “Pride” ;
for it is a sweet and gentle and a pride-
ful thing to sit in judgment, as Mr. Part-
ridge does, on all the English prose in the
world ; to examine, with a multiplicity of
examples that suggests much devoted
study —doubtless for scientific purposes—
the errors of the detective novelists ; to
inspect the innumerable stylistic abomina-
tions of the daily newspapers ; to catch
Shakspeare in a fault of grammar, Keats
in a woolliness of phrase and (rightly)
Gerard Manley Hopkins in “strange and
inexcusable distortions.”
It is pride, one may suspect, that makes
Mr. Partridge such a jolly fellow. He
pauses for four columns after his list of
traditional nouns of assemblage to sug-
gest modern ones, some from “Punch,”
many of his own playful invention: a
“dampness” of babies, an “explosion” of
colonels, an “envy” of Communists, a
“boodle” of company promoters, a “pro-
crastination” of plumbers, a “gloom” of
Russians, an “eisteddfod” of Welshmen,
a “vanity” of writers, a “superiority” of
young people. A dissertation on puns
and kindred witticisms leads him into six
columns of merry examples, among
which Oscar Wilde, as usual, shines
brightest:
Sir Lewis Morris (author of The Epic of
Hades), feeling disgruntled by the neglect
with which he met while successors to the
Laureateship were being discussed after
Tennyson’s death: “It is a complete con-
spiracy of silence against me! What ought
I to do, Oscar?” “Join it,” said Wilde.
This, in Mr. Partridge, is the jollity of
the successful hunter—for all scholarship
is a sublimation of the primitive lust to
kill; which probably explains why so
many scholars read detective novels.
Some pursue and bring home in triumph
the rare author, the dead language, the
elusive meaning in an obscure phrase,
ancient or modern ; some hunt the scan-
dals of Rome ; Mr. Partridge hunts lapses
of style. Where everybody else is wrong
—for nobody who puts a lot of words to-
gether can help fumbling once in a while
—Mr. Partridge is always right. No
wonder he is happy.
And, that being so, the temptation is
always to catch Mr. Partridge in error.
Anticipating this pleasant necessity, Mr.
Partridge obligingly includes, among his
discussions of other men’s errors, some
sins from his own writings. It is hardly
possible to dispute with him on points of
grammar, nor yet on the niceties of style,
what words are archaic, what falsely ele-
gant, what horrors are perpetrated by the
excessive use of “got,” what phrases are
cliches, what is journalese, what is scien-
tific jargon and why (though Neville
Cardus could hardly write his cricket re-
ports without them) such words as
“cyclone,” “tornado,” “typhoon” and
“hurricane” are best confined to their
meteorological sense.
Nevertheless, one may disagree with
the grammarian on matters of taste. Mr.
Partridge has an excessively high opinion
of the alliterative prose of G. K. Chester-
ton and Frank Binder. Tennyson, who
said his “s’s” “hissed at him like snakes,”
would hardly have approved of Chester-
ton’s “At this moment could be seen,
striding across the sun-chequered lawn,
the large and swaggering figure of Cap-
tain Gahagan,” nor of Binder’s “cour-
teous communications from some
superior spirit who takes our favored ones
by the hand and who leads them with a
studied certainty of step to the sure sum-
mits of art.” In prose, as in poetry,
alliteration is a device to be used more
subtly than this or else it becomes, as in
Swinburne, mere decoration, clogging and
obscuring the pure flow of words,
cheapening the melody of the language.
Mr. Partridge is happier, perhaps, when
he has a single word under the micro-
scope than when he looks out on prose
style at large.
Certainly he is more at home with
prose than with poetry. Though he —or,
rather, Wilson Bennington, who wrote
for him the note on “Poets’ Licence” —
expresses a definite condemnation of
Hopkins’s “strange and inexcusable dis-
tortions of syntax”—Mr. Partridge’s
general opinion seems to be that, faults
of grammar apart, poets are mad and
may do what they like. Mad they may
be; but if Mr. Partridge had been blown
out of The Bulletin office by all the
“zephyrs” that whistle through the door-
way when the rejected contributions are
being returned, he would certainly, have
added that word to his list of archaisms
and have stated clearly that such poeti-
cisms are no longer employed by reput-
able writers of verse.
Noting even that “bosoms” are becom-
ing rather out of date —belonging, with
“damsel” and “imbibe,” to the category
of improper “Elegancies”—Mr, Part-
ridge lists several pages of archaisms —
including “deem,” “ere,” “eve,” “fain,”
“I wis,” “tarry,” “ween,” “yon” and
“yore’”—yet he appears to consider these
monstrosities permissible in poetry as
“technicalities.” His book would have
been much improved had he taken the
standpoint of W. B. Yeats: “Use the
natural words in their natural order. All
archaisms apd inversions are bad.”
This failure to keep in touch with the
development of poetry is really surpris-
ing in Mr. Partridge, for it is the develop-
ment of the language as a whole that
primarily interests him: what old words
have become worn out, what new words
have become respectable, what are the
proper words to use now in a good plain
English style. It is dangerous to find
fault with him, for there may very well
be half a dozen lapses of style in this
article ; and it is also, though tempting,
ungracious: for he forces one to look
critically at every word one writes, and
that, the purity of the language being
essential to clear thinking, and so, ulti-
mately, to the welfare of the nation, is a
great and noble work. Some of our more
illiterate Australian writers should make
this book their Bible and there is no one
who would not profit by the study of it.
Wowsers and censors should take to
heart Mr. Partridge’s paragraph on “un-
printable” words where he points out that,
were there no synonyms available, there
would be no euphemisms, and so, because
everybody would have to use them, no
“obscenity” in the words that now make
wowsers faint and policemen blush. There
is no difference, really, he points out, be-
tween the “polite” word that anybody is
free to print and the “rude” word —
meaning exactly the same thing—which,
if printed, will cause instant banning. The
more one thinks about it the madder is
the censorship seen to be.
Subtitled “A Guide to Good English,”
Usage and Abusage is intended as a
companion to Fowler, to “supplement
and complement” the standard Modern
English Usage. Mr. Partridge may well
be proud of it, for it is comprehensive,
authoritative and remarkably readable.
As an example of its everyday usefulness
—a troubled businessman asked the Red
Page if it was correct to write, as he hacf
read in a report, “There was no doubt
about his efficacy as a farmer.” The
answer was in Partridge:
Efficient, effectual, effective and efficacious
are often confused. The efficient man
(capable, “knowing his job”) is effective in
action, and his action is effectual in achiev-
ing its purpose. An efficient doctor pre-
scribes only such - medicines as are
efficacious.
The businessman’s word should have
been “efficiency” ; and Mr. Partridge’s
book has proved immediately efficient,
effectual, effective or efficacious.
Sensitive Plants .
There is much to recommend William
Maxwell’s The Folded Leaf (Faber;
Angus and Robertson); chiefly, it is an
attempt at “fine writing” ; what might be
called educated style as distinct from the
illiterate prose in which the Hemingway
school makes a virtue of necessity. Its
roots are not in journalism, but in litera-
ture:—
The blue lines down the floor of the
swimming-pool wavered and shivered in-
cessantly, and something about the shape
of the place—the fact that it was long and
narrow, perhaps, and lined with tile to the
ceiling—made their voices ring. The same
voices that sounded sad in the open air,
on the high school playground. “Lights!
Lights! ” it seemed as if they were shouting
at each other across the water and from
the balcony stairs.
If the novel could be taken as indicating
a trend in American writing, it would sug-
gest a return to the tradition of Haw-
thorne and Melville, that older, more
stable culture, closely linked to the
European, which appeared to become
precious and die out in the later novels
of Cabell. In some respects The Folded
Leaf is the sort of writing Henry James
might have done had he remained in his
native land.
Whether or not such a return is occur-
ring one can only speculate. Normally,
failing the phenomenon of a Conrad, fine
writing is extraneous to the'development
of the novel, in which the rich portrayal
of life is more important than elegance.
The best American fiction has been
written by such men as Sinclair Lewis and
James Gould Cozzens, who, while never
surrendering to the Hemingway fashion,
either in its crudity or in its affectation,
have concerned themselves far more with
characterisation than with prose style as
such. But, if only to balance the pro-
letarian school, writing such as Maxwell’s
would certainly be welcome. And, as
editor of the “New Yorker,” he is likely
enough to be in the centre of whatever
new movement is developing.
Maxwell has, too, some of the virtues
of Lewis and Cozzens; he gives a con-
vincing picture of American life, of its
fundamental kinship with human life
anywhere, of its fascinating difference in
the odd little details that make the flavor
and color of existence. In English'
schools, for instance, there is “ragging” ;
in Australian and New Zealand schools
new pupils are generally subjected to
some form of initiation ceremony, from
a simple fight to the. more elaborate
ordeal of “crowning”—with an unmen-
tionable article —that used to be prac-
tised at a school which had better not be
named. But in America this is appar-
ently organised on the grand scale. The
boys at the school with which the first
half of The Folded Leaf is concerned hire
a room in a hotel and, one by one, the
candidates for admission to the
“fraternity” knock at the door:
“Who’s there?”
The voice that spoke through the closed
door was hollow and sinister.
Spud answered according to previous
instructions: “Neophyte wishing admission
to the Isle of Thura.”
“Shut your eyes, neophyte, and face the
other way on pain of deadly punishment.”
The neophytes were only kept in line
half an hour. The more refined torments
had to be administered singly. Carson
wrestled for a long time with temptation.
Lynch had to scramble like an egg, and
Ford ate a square meal. De Fresne wore
the skin off the end of his nose pushing a
penny along the red carpet To test their
courage they were pushed one at a time
up a tall stepladder from which, at a given
signal, they were to throw themselves into
space.,.•
There is more of this sort of informa-
tion about schools and universities ; and,
here and there, interesting or amusing
glimpses of the American world’ at large
—a father and son eating at a restaurant
with absolutely nothing to say to each
other; a wealthy aunt scoring off poor
relations, spending a whole day de-
lightedly tormenting her brother, now
financially at her mercy—“At last she
had repaid him for calling her a spider
when they were children, 35 years be-
fore.”
But The Folded Leaf is not, taken all
round, a novel of life in the sense that
Lewis’s and Cozzens’s books are. The
author’s humanity is enclosed, as it were.
by his intention to write finely and sensi-
tively ; pressed small by this ambition,
smothered by it. The book is life seen
through a cold and narrow glass, school-
boys and university undergraduates
viewed as “folded leaves”; life, in a
word, intellectualised. The approach has
its merits: not only the felicities of style,
but, in the author’s frequent comparisons
of the behavior of schoolboys with that
of savages—he tries to depict the years
of youth as a prolonged initiation cere-
mony—a touch of satire, a glimpse of
profundity. And there is, in the basic
concept implied in the title, some truth:
boys do “unfold.”
Some truth; but far more of falsity.
For how could you possibly give a true
nicture of the whole roaring, howling,
leaping, bounding, stumbling, bumbling,
hairy reality of schoolboys if you saw
them, seriously, reverently, tenderly, as
“unfolding leaves”? Huckleberry Finn,
nc doubt, could be portrayed as just such
a sensitive plant as are Maxwell’s Spud
and Lymie; a leaf, a twig, a little pink
blossom of life: but Mark Twain, and
generations of readers have been gratefu'
for it, made him a boy.
Maxwell’s blossoms, Spud and
Lymie, are not of much interest because
they are, at best, only half real. The
story of their love for each other —and
that is the central theme of the novel —
lacks dramatic interest because it lacks
the full flavor of humanity. It is all too
“quivering,” too “shuddering,” too senti-
mental —if not “decadent,” certainly too
damned girlish. It is impossible, when
Lymie attempts to kill himself because
Spud doesn’t understand him, to feel
anything beyond a vague regret that the
attempt was not a success.
A further disadvantage, contributing to
thd unreality of the novel, is that Max-
well is influenced by Freudian psychology
and, whenever Spud has a fight, feels
obliged to point out that the youth is
really (according to Freud) trying to
murder his father. It is really remark-
able, when you come to think of it, that
the race of fathers has not been wiped
out, so many millions of small boys, for
so many thousands of years, have been
thirsting for their blood.

HUGH MCCRAE.
An Admirer of Art.
Mary P. Harris’s Art, The Torch of
Life (Rigby, Ltd., Adelaide) is, as the
title suggests, sufficiently reverent. A
kind of reverence fills every page, which
leads to an impression of preciosity.
That, in dealing with both Australian and
European painters, the author’s reverence
is generally justified only increases the
sense of embarrassment.
A good deal of the book is taken up
with the history of art, from primitive
art to Rembrandt. This is too sketchy
to be valuable, except as a gentle intro-
duction to the subject, but there are
interesting reproductions of famous
pictures—compositions reduced to out-
line, with explanations. For example,
“The School of Athens,” by Raphael,
with heavily marked arches and
dotted lines over the two large groups of
heads, and the comments:
Arch beyond arch suggests the unfolding
of thought throughout the ages. Plato and
Aristotle are in the centre. These classical
figures link up with the romantic figure
of Diogenes on the steps. The level group
of figures behind should be compared with
the two irregular groups in the foreground.
On the left is Pythagoras writing in a book,
while above is Socrates expounding.
Bramante, from whom Raphael took les-
sons in architecture, is on the right. The
symbolic figures of Astronomy and
Geography complete the group, with
Raphael and Perugino slightly behind.
And similarly, with Giotto, Botticelli, Da
Vinci, Tintoretto, Veronese (“Parallel
lines echo a sense of rest”), Van Eyck,
Diirer, Velasquez (“The right angle ex-
presses stability and restraint”), Rem-
brandt. The analysis of Tom Roberts’s
“The Breakaway” is:
Diagonal lines in a composition express
energy and action. Most important is the
diagonal from the base of the trees to the
hooves of the rider’s horse. To prevent
this line hurtling the spectator out of the
picture, a transverse diagonal is introduced
by the out-thrust leg of the stock-rider.
The eye is thus led to the horizon. A
steadying vertical is suggested uniting the
smoke-drift and bird in the middle distance.
This upright affords an interesting parallel
with the trees on the left.
It is the chapters op Roberts, Heysen,
Streeton, Sydney Long, E. Phillips Fox,
and the final chapter, “The Development
of Australian Art,” which “carry” the
book. Except for Heysen’s “Mystic
Morn,” in colored reproduction, the
plates are in black-and-white, an un-
satisfactory representation. And in the
Australian section the writer’s admiration
becomes most ardent —as is obvious in
the final chapter:
Amongst Australian artists the greatest
love and admiration of the people is given
to Hans Heysen, and the reason is not far
to seek. For Hans Heysen is a painter
above all of gumtrees, from the tender
saplings of the “Mystic Morn” in the
Adelaide Gallery, where the young and
wayward growth is like a fountain spray
blown by the wind, to “Red-Gold” of epic
grandeur. . .
Elsewhere there is much talk of “mon-
archical gums,” of “trouble in the soul”
and “the starry hosts of heaven.” All
this builds up to lushness, undiscrimmat-
ing fervency. There is a measure of
truth in it all, but it is like a tourist
bureau poster which describes the “syl-
van beauty” and “scenic grandeur” of
some scene or other.
There is, too, a suspicion of the par-
ochial about the volume as a whole. The
book was written in South Australia,
published in Adelaide, and the writer is
a lecturer at the South Australian
National Gallery. Throughout, there are
frequent references to that gallery, which
gives the impression that other galleries,
and private collections, have not been
fully considered. There is no mention
of Gruner.

Who originally owned the Channel Islands?
When and how did Britain gain control ?
The Channel Islands were included in the
domains of the Dukes of Normandy, and be-
came part of England on the accession to the
throne of William the Conqueror. In the reign
of King John they were formally attached,
although the duchy of Normandy was by that
time separated, and succeeding kings confirmed
the islanders’ special privileges and immunities.
Until the reign of William 111 the islanders
possessed the right of neutrality.

Chequers, the residence, was presented to the

then the estate was added to the gift by
Lord Lee. Chequers is a Tudor mansion
in the Chilterns, about three miles from Princes
Risborough, Bucks., and contains a collection
of Cromwellian portraits and relics.

Biographical details concerning Price Warung,
author of “Tales of the Convict System”?
Real name William Astley. He was born
in 1855, and his stories of the convict system
were the result of 20 years’ study of early
Australian history. In addition to his first
book, Tales of the Convict System, he wrote
Tales of the Early Days, Tales of the Isle of
Death, and Half-crown Bob. He left unfinished
a novel and a history of Australian bush-
ranging. As a journalist he was a strong ad-
vocate of Federation. He died in 1911.

Titles of books giving the positions of the
various stars most commonly known, with
their names and a short description as to why
named ?
To get the positions of the principal stars,
first of all it would be necessary for you to
purchase a star atlas. Norton’s Star Atlas is
a good and inexpensive one. For short de-
scriptions of stars and constellations there are
several little books published. Stars of the
Southern Heavens, by J. Nangle (Angus and
Robertson), and Stars of the Southern Skies
(Longmans, Green and Co.) would be suitable.

Is there any authentic records that cricket
matches were played in Australia or England
for stake-money?
Before the first intercolonial match in 1856 an
advt. in Melbourne “Argus” challenged N.S.W.
to play Victoria for £5OO, but it was turned
down ; “the N.S.W. team declined to play for
anything less than honor, to which Victoria
very wisely acceded,” said the chronicler.
N.S.W. won that first match at Melbourne
by three wickets. Concerning England, Lord
Hawke, writing in Cricket Form at a Glance,
by Home Gordon, said: “In 1745 Sussex played
Middlesex on the Artillery Ground for 200
guineas; in 1768 the third Duke of Rich-
mond led Sussex against Hambledon, winning
the match and near a £lOOO besides.” There are
many other claims of big stakes being played
for, but there is little to support them.

are pruned immediately after the flowering is

the buds have set will spoil this year’s flower-

Young shrubs must not be pruned until at
least four years old.

Brief Answers.
S.M.: Eels from all over the world do not
migrate to the sea near Bermuda —only the
American and European freshwater eels. Those
of other countries have separate breeding-places,
though few of them are definitely known. Some
freshwater eels breed in East Indian seas and
the Australian species are believed to breed
somewhere near New Caledonia.. . .W.C.: It
is an offence to drive a motor vehicle on any
public street without having it registered. The
roads described come within the definition of
a “public street” and you would therefore be
guilty of an offence when driving your un-
registered vehicle on them R.C.N.: Bulletin
“Red Page” reviews of books by Gavin Casey
have appeared as follows: It’s Harder for Girls
(June 10, 1942), Birds of a Feather (April 26,
1944) and Downhill Is Easier (March 20, 1946).
....C.D.: The S.S. Kyogle was built at Glas-
gow in 1901 for the North Coast Steam Navi-
gation Co., Sydney, which used the vessel trading
from Sydney to N.S.W. North Coast ports until
1923. Early in 1924 the vessel was acquired
by the Commonwealth Government and used
as a lighthouse tender in Western Australia
until 1931, when she was sold for breaking up
purposes... .P.S.: The production of a birth
certificate is not necessary J.H.: Write Re-
patriation Commission, Grace Building, 77
York-street, Sydney... .J.H.: You will require
a passport obtainable from the Customs Dept.,
Brisbane, and an income-tax clearance from
the Taxation Dept., Brisbane N.8.W.:
George Baker, 26 Hunter-street, Sydney
K.M.McG.: A Spade Guinea is a gold coin
of England from the reign of Charles I to
George 111 and was so called because on the
reverse the coat-of-arms shown was roughly
in the shape of q spade or shovel. Collector’s
value is about 305.... .R.H.W.: Collector’s
value is about £l.. ..V.M.: Your duty to in-
vitees on your launch is to have it reasonably
safe for .the use that is to be made of it. If
an invitee is injured or loses his life through
your negligence, you would be liable for
damages. In the absence of negligence you
would be under no liability E.S.L.: The
landlord may, after a proper notice to quit,
take proceedings to evict the tenants on any
of the grounds set out in the Nat. Sec. (Land-
lord and Tenant) Regs, {e.g., non-payment of
rent, breach of covenant, etc.),, but not other-
wise C.A.M.: It is the horse which is dis-
qualified and the turf club is not concerned (as
regards the disqualification) with the private
arrangements between owner and lessee.

Do you know that a boy went up in the air
Over to Spain to see a Polar bear?
But the bear was nowhere to be seen
And so the Boy had to steer the Machine
Over mountains and forests of green,
Clouds and storms and many a human “bean”
Till he saw the bear standing there
With ice on his whiskers and fur for hair —
“My gosh,” said the Boy, “I don’t like your stare,”
So he turned the machine and woke in his chair.
A leasee to State, that conscience profound.
To hail a streetcar cityward bound
A lady with purposeful tread did go
To convert to benefit the answer—No.
A devotee to chics, all manner of breed,
Of impish behavior she took no heed,
But proctor of State? Never aglow _
When foretold is the answer —No.
She knocked on counter, common to all,
She waited, she watched all in their stall.
Benighted and blum with freedom flung—Lo ! *
Here’s they outgrow that answer—No.
Bland to the eye, twaddle on tongue,
She rested from shoe, this being unsung;
Choosed she the man best likely to know;
Adjusted her answers to a decisive —No.
My grandfather, indeed, was too fond of his cup,
But a man stronger of breed than the one slaujiter-
ing up ;
He wrestled with problems and tended his mow;
Never conscious did answer —No, no!
Well, well, she did tremble at the knee
When back came two men, one was he.
Fixed was his gaze and ponderous—Oh!
Felt sure she the answer was No
With pies and dainties she tempted the knight:
“This wise woman never could challenge my Bight—
Such comity pleads me to forego
The continuity of No.”

CHEAPLABOR
By E.O. SCHLUNKE
WHEN Albert Krantz applied for
two Italian prisoners-of-war to
work on his farm, he was not
content to fill in the required
form and wait. He haunted the Control
Centre and* displaying a surprising agility
for a man of his age and bulk, was con-
tinually cornering the C.O. and saying in
an urgent, secretive half-whisper: “Now,
remember what I said ; two big, strong
fellows, and they must be experienced in
axe work.”
HIS first impression was one of in-
tense disappointment. There were
no big, strong men. Some looked fairly
sturdy, but all were short and many slight
as well. Krantz, breathing hard because
any kind of agitation brought on his
asthma, pushed in and grabbed the sleeve
of the C.O. who was busy with his
n.c.os. trying to get them sorted out into
alphabetical order. The officer jerked his
arm away and said rudely: “This is the
way God made them. If you want yours
bigger, you’d better go to Italy and breed
them yourself.”
Very slowly the C.C. staff got the pris-
oners sorted out and taken to farms in
batches in military trucks. But Krantz
stayed there all the time, watching and
waiting, alert to frustrate any attempt
to put anything over him.
After several hours the staff-sergeant
told him his pair were ready. Krantz
had a good look at them, screwing up his
mean little eyes, his face very dissatisfied.
One of them was short and fat, with a
long, Hebraic nose, and beady, bright,
shrewd eyes. He smiled at Krantz, in-
clining his head in a sort of a little bow,
while moving his hands in a brief,
gracious gesture at waist height.
The other was taller; a gawky youth
with flat broad nose and big loose lips,
astonishingly like an Australian aborig-
gine, and almost as dark. In contrast with
the other’s suavity he stood awkwardly,
with his greatcoat pushed baclf, and his
hands in his trousers pockets. He shot
one brief, bashful glance at Krantz, who
was surprised to see a pair of beautiful,
soft, big brown eyes of the kind Holly-
wood writers describe as “smouldering.”
Krantz signed a document acknowledg-
ing delivery of Guiseppe Carofilio (the
fat one) and Antonio Costa and led them
off to his car,
Guiseppe sprang forward,' opened the
door smartly and held it for Krantz ;
Antonio came stumbling along with his
gear, and nearly got in before h'is em-
ployer.
Down the street, at the Railway Hotel,
a crowd of farm workers and their less
reputable town friends poured out on to
the pavement, Jim Lacey in the middle
of them, pretending to be extravagantly
amused ; Jim Lacey the odd-job contrac-
tor, whose extortionate ideas about his
share of the profits had decided Krantz
to get the Italians.
THERE was still half an hour of day-
light left when Krantz arrived at his
home, so he beckoned his prisoners to the
woodheap to see how they shaped.
Guiseppe appeared to be a trifle dis-
concerted at being set to work so soon,
but Antonio acted as if it was all the
same to him.
He threw off his greatcoat, seized an
axe as if he was meeting an old friend
and deliberately attacked the biggest and
toughest log. In a few minutes of skilful
and forceful chopping he had cut it
through. Guiseppe drew Krantz’s atten-
tion to it like a showman exhibiting his
star performer. Krantz said, “Good,
good,” enthusiastically.
The youth made a restrained, depre-
catory gesture, and spoke for the first
time. “Niente,” he said modestly, but
his big simple eyes looked enormously
pleased.
Krantz turned expectantly to Guiseppe.
He sprang to attention, seized another
log and brought it to Antonio. But
Krantz stopped Antonio and made Gui-
seppe take the axe. Guiseppe tried to
imitate Antonio, but to Krantz it looked
as if he had nevea had an axe in his
hand before.
A great anger and shame came over
Krantz, He had been done in the eye
properly over 50 per cent, of his ac-
quisitions,
Krantz went into his house, put a loaf
of bread—half a week old, but that
made it good for the digestion—a
junk of cold salt mutton, three chipped
enamel plates and some bent knives and
forks on the table. Then he called the
men to eat.
Guiseppe came in first, his eye hunting
round eagerly, and his long nose alert
for savory odors. It took him only a
moment to realise the state of affairs. A
look of crushing woe descended on his
face. He said ; “No moglia?” in a voice
of such anguish that he nearly made
Krantz share his view that the absence of
a woman (and home cooking) was a
major tragedy.
He stabbed at his meat with a child-
ishly peevish expression on his face, but
presently his eye began to light up again.
He started to talk very earnestly to An-
tonio, apparently trying to convince him
of something. Antonio grunted out a
curt monosyllable occasionally and gave
him no encouragement. At length Gui-
seppe turned to Krantz.
“Me unnerstan plenty cookus.” He
went to the stove and demonstrated with
various utensils. “You unnerstan? Me
unnerstan omeletta.”
He broke some invisible eggs into an
imaginary bowl, whisked them into a
froth, so airy that it almost had to be held
down, poured it into a pan, watched it
lovingly while it set, flipped it over and
sniffed the aroma with great gusto.
But Krantz was still feeling very an-
noyed with Guiseppe for not being a
good axeman. He pointed to the vic-
tuals on the table with his fork, and
said ;
“Bread ; meat; good.”
Guiseppe made a little gesture, admit-
ting that, being the boss, he must be
right.
NEXT morning Krantz loaded his men
with axes, saws, wedges and mallet
and led them for a long walk through
a scrub paddock to a flat where a lot of
large, ring-barked box-trees stood. His big
tall box-trefes, which would yield thirty
sound, solid fenceposts each and for
which Lacey had offered him five shil-
lings. And that at a time when each
night he was taking away five pounds
worth of rabbits and giving nothing to
Krantz, who had bred and fed them ; a
state of things which made JCrantz feel
extremely uneasy every time he drove
past the cemetery where his parsimonious
German-born peasant ancestors lay.
When they started work Guiseppe soon
demonstrated that he was even more
unskilful with a cross-cut saw than with
an axe, and very much out of condition
as well. In ten minutes he had to take
a rest, but he covered up his shortcom-
ings by saying to Krantz: “Me no un-
nerstan sega, ma! me unnerstan sega
two free day ; allora me unnerstan sega.”
By substituting suitable verbs for “un-
nerstan” (which was the only English
verb Guiseppe knew), Krantz interpreted
the sentence to mean that, though Gui-
seppe knew nothing about the saw, he
would master it in two or three days.
Antonio, who spoke no English but
seemed to “unnerstan,” twisted his ugly
mouth in scornful doubt.
It took a long time to get the tree
down and saw off a length. Then Krantz
undertook to show them how to split it
into fence-posts. Just at that untimely
moment Jim Lacey came stalking into the
clearing with a shotgun in his hand and
a couple of lean and ugly greyhounds
limping fastidiously behind him. He
grinned sardonically at the two men
standing, watching, while Krantz worked.
He sat down on the log and offered
Antonio a cigarette. Antonio took it with
a look of delighted surprise and sat down
too. Lacey was just extending the packet
to Guiseppe when Krantz told him sharply
to take the mallet. Lacey’s eyes ran
over Guiseppe’s fat form, and a sly
grin came over his face. He watched him
expectantly. After a couple of minutes
he exclaimed in an incredulous voice,
“Well, I’ll be damned! I didn’t think
it was possible, but the wedges are com-
ing out again.”
Krantz turned his back on Lacey and
made desperate signs to Guiseppe to hit
harder. But when Guiseppe tried to hit
harder he mishit the wedge and knocked
it out of the fissure Krantz had started.
Lacey became profane with wonder.
From the way the Italians looked at
each other, Krantz could see they knew
that Lacey was ragging him. Then
Lacey said “Strike me bandy! but he’s
done it. You just need to let him work
a bit longer and the tree will stand up
again.” And Krantz turned on him:
“We don’t need you here, Lacey. You’re
only making it harder for the men to
leam their job.”
Lacey ambled off happily, making for
Krantz’s hills with the obvious intention
of hunting foxes there, though he did not
ask for permission. The Italians looked

7f's fAe TOTAL Cost that Counts!"
In goods freighting, os in other things, the main cost is not to be
confused with the total cost. They are two different things different
by the cost of the. miscellaneous incidentals. For instance, when you
freight by air with TAA, you save on packaging costs because your
• consignment is not subject to rough handling . . . you save waste
through spoilage and pilfering . . . and, the speed of TAA Air Express
Service enables you to take advantage of sudden markets because you
can be sure of your goods being on the spot at the right time.
There are many other advantages, too. Business houses are invited
to ring for a representative to call and discuss all aspects of air freight.

after him regretfully. Krantz took up his
instructions again, but he felt that he
hadn’t the same grip on his men as be-
fore.
ALL day Guiseppe puffed and panted
and had to stop for rests. Antonio
worked like a tireless machine, but lack-
ing an efficient partner Krantz could not
get the most out, of him. He praised him
repeatedly, hoping to stir 'Guiseppe into
emulation. But Guiseppe became morose
and worked in a dull, unwilling manner.
When they stopped work at night
Krantz counted the posts, estimated the
cost, and began to wonder if he had not
made a terrible mistake.
On the way home Antonio dashed
about in the scrub with the sheep dogs,
trying to catch a rabbit. But Guiseppe
walked wearily and miserably with
Krantz, always a couple of steps behind
him as if he was too dispirited to make
the effort to catch up.
After a while Krantz said, to relieve
the rather unhappy silence.
“Antonio is a very smart fellow.”
Guiseppe said nothing. Krantz said
“Antonio good.”
Guiseppe made a gesture indicating that
there was a lot that Krantz didn’t know.
“Bas Italia no good,” he said. And
though he used “Low Italy” as a geo-
graphical term, it was clear that he meant
it in a more embracing sense.
“In bas Italia, black aboriginale; no
wash, plenti rubare,” Guiseppe made a
slick gesture illustrating a pickpocket at
work, “plenti coltello.” Here he made
such a vicious stab that Krantz’s intestines
recoiled from the imaginary knife.
He went on in silence, leaving the na;sty
insinuations to circulate in Krantz’s mind.
When they got to the sheds one of
Krantz’s few half - wild hens jumped
noisily from a haystack.
Guiseppe’s face lit up ; he ran nimbly
to the nest, came back with a dozen eggs,
gloating over them as if they were made
of gold.
Krantz gloated a bit, too, because a
dozen eggs could be sold for 2s. But
when Guiseppe pleaded with him to let
him “fare omeletta” he consented be-
cause it was such a relief to see his face
animated after the woeful, non-co-opera-
tive look it had worn all the afternoon.
He didn’t anticipate that Guiseppe
would use the whole dozen eggs and half
a pound of buffer as well. But when he
tasted the omelette he ceased to grieve
about the expense. Krantz had been living
alone so long and designing his meals to
save as much time and money as possible
that he had forgotten the taste of good
food. And he had never tasted anything
so designed to seduce the palate as Gui-
seppe’s omelette; he had put all the art
of Italy into it.
“Very, very good, Guiseppe,” Krantz
said benignly.
Guiseppe made a little bow, and said,
“Tank you, Mistair.” He shot a superior,
indifferent glance on the dark ftative of
Leche. Then he went on to tell Krantz
about all the good dishes they ate in
Italy, becoming very enthusiastic and
quite amusing in the pantomiming he
used to supplement his English.
Krantz felt that if only he could keep
him in this mood he would get quite a
lot of work out of him.
]\l EXT morning Guiseppe walked out
. close beside Krantz, chatting away
in a very amiable manner, with his “me
unnerstan, you unnerstan,” while Antonio
walked silently on the flank.
But the work proved too difficult for
him again; the smiles faded from his
face, and the suavity deserted him. His
work became less and less effective and
Krantz had to chide him repeatedly,
Antonio became the favorite again, and
he smirked like any self-satisfied youth,
shooting patronising advice at Guiseppe
from the corner of his big mouth.
At about three o’clock in the afternoon
Antonio and the dogs caught a rabbit.
Guiseppe ran his hands over it; his face
began to beam; both rushed over to
Krantz. Could Guiseppe cook the rabbit
for tea? Krantz consented graciously.
Rabbits cost nothing.
Guiseppe disappeared the first moment
Krantz took his eye off him. Antonio
explained that he had gone to “cookus
conelia.” Krantz decided it wouldn’t
pay to go after him and bring him back,
but he was Worried. Discipline would
decline and costs go up if he wasn’t care-
ful.
But Guiseppe had something to show
for the hours he had spent. Every sauce-
pan and baking dish Krantz possessed
was steaming on the fire, and the table
was covered with the litter of much in-
dustry. Guiseppe called out triumphantly
to Antonio, lifted the lid of each pot for
him to look inside and smell; meanwhile
they both jabbered away in the greatest
excitement. •
The rabbit was simmering in one, after
having been roasted in the oven. In
another was a savory stew of onions and
other herbs Guiseppe had located grow-
ing wild in Krantz’s abandoned vegetable
garden. An enormous boiler was full of
spaghetti he had made of flour and eggs
rolled out as thin as paper and cut into
narrow ribbons.
At a brisk word of command from
Guiseppe, Antonio rushed away to wash
his hands, and rushed back to help in a
great shuffling of pots and pans and co-
ordination of preparations. Guiseppe
shouted instructions as if he was launch-
ing a liner and Antonio obeyed him,
eagerly, willingly apd unquestioningly.
At the same moment everything came
off the stove. The rabbit, smelling like
a masterpiece of old Rome, was en-
throned in the centre of a huge dish.
The spaghetti (strained, and set with a
dash of cold water) piled round it, and
the savory sauce poured - over the lot.
Krantz enjoyed it so much that when
Guiseppe daringly hinted that he had
seen something that might have wine in
it, in the pantry, he ordered him to bring
it out. They all had enough to feel that
the war and other barriers between them
did not matter.
KJ EXT day Krantz overlooked many
1 of Guiseppe’s shortcomings and re-
membered to praise his cooking nearly
as often as he praised Antonio’s splitting.
They all had a very cordial day together,
and for the first time the rate of output
promised a margin of profit. Krantz
smiled to himself, because he had dis-
covered how to handle Italians,
Early in the afternoon Guiseppe began
to tell Krantz about a marvellous “pasta”
he could make out of scraps of meat and
cheese he had seen in the house. He
would line a bowl with pastry, put a layer
of meat seasoned with onions; then a
layer of pastry, then grated cheese and
breadcrumbs ; then pastry, chopped vege-
tables, meat and so on. He described it
minutely, in the making, the cooking and
the eating.
At 3.30 he told Krantz it would take
several hours to prepare and cook it.
Krantz hurried him off immediately.
The day after the “pasta” Guiseppe was
so high in favor that Krantz sent him on
the ? bicycle to Chepley village for the
mail and bread. When he came home he
had anew expression on his face. It
was not morose, yet it was not cheerful,
and it was accompanied by a simmer of
excitement. Krantz studied him rather
uneasily, wondering if he was going to
learn something new about the psychology
of Italians. Suddenly Guiseppe began
to babble; “In post office,” he said, and
his eyes gleamed ecstatically. “Un donna
giovanile, bella: molta bella!”
Krantz felt relieved. The daughter of
the postmistress was young and good-
looking, but she was also a sensible girl.
Guiseppe rubbed his face.and forehead
with his hands.
“O belladonna, similar donna Italiana.
Plenti dis”—he indicated curves. Then he
made a despairing gesture. “Ah, no good
prigionaires, no posseebile one belladonna
Australiana.” He shook his head at his
miserable condition; but from the ex-
pression on his face he found some
pleasure in it.
Krantz smiled craftily, and said ;
“If you good, Guiseppe, plenti work ;
plenti cook; you go post office one other
time.”
“O tank you, Mistair,” said Guiseppe,
as if the last part of the sentence alone
mattered. ]
' Every day Guiseppe tempted Krantz
with some delectable dish and every

TRUMAN DOCTRINE.
On March 12 President Truman put
squarely to Congress for endorsement a
foreign policy proposal of vast propor-
tions, involving, as the publication “World
Report” expressed it, nothing less than
“a sharp break with U.S. tradition and
a sensational twist in U.S.-Soviet rela-
tions.”
About a week earlier, on March 4,
Secretary of State Marshall had given
advance notice of the proposed policy,
saying “The problems involved are so far-
reaching and of such transcendent im-
portance that any announcement relating
to them could properly come only from
the President himself.”
The President based his announcement
on a request to Congress for $400,000,000
worth of aid for Greece and Turkey,
but that was merely incidental. Accord-
ing to the well-informed N.Y. “Times”
Washington correspondent Arthur Krock,
Mr. Truman had long been waiting for
the exactly right opportunity to launch
the new policy;
There is good reason to believe that as long
ago as the London Conference of Foreign
Ministers the President began to abandon real
hope of the effectiveness for enduring peace
and security of a continued policy of appease-
ment and official treatment of Russia as a
Government friendly to the United States.
Krock declares that the President
“made up his mind then that, when a
fitting opportunity arose and one which
Congress and the people would recognise
as such, he would proclaim the new
doctrine.” On several occasions “he
thought the time had come, but some
of his important advisers talked him out.
of it,” The opportunity was at last pro-
vided by the Greek and Turkish appeals
for aid, made urgent by the constant
Soviet pressure to impose control over
both countries and by Britain’s Note
announcing - that it could not continue
givirig military and economic aid to
Greece and intended withdrawing by
March 31.
A “Must” Policy
Some of his advisers, as Krock reports,
tried to induce the President to restrict
himself merely to announcing that the
U.S. “would by request assist Greece to
retain its political and attain its economic
independence.” Others counselled that
“the anti-Communist doctrine be applied
to Western Europe (determined by a line
running roughly from the Oder to the
mouth of the Adriatic), the Western
Hemisphere and areas of obvious strategic
importance in the Far East.” Secretary
of State Marshall was against both these
restrictions. On all sides
It was agreed that Communism, inspired by
Russia in its political form, was a continuous-
subterranean movement, exploding to,-the sur-
face one day here, one day there and
place next week. It was agreed that the spread
and effectiveness of these explosions was the
greatest possible menace to the security of the
United States and its system, and to enduring
peace. *
With Mr. Marshall’s agreement, the
President decided that the time had come
for what he had * had in mind all along,
“to make a global statement of policy to
cover the perambulating threat.” Anti-
cipating that Congress would take longer
than till March 31 to endorse a policy
of such wide implications—Congress
went on chewing the issue over and hav-
ing spasms of digestive trouble through-
out April —the President induced Britain
to hold on in Greece pending the decision,
and forthwith announced the new United
States policy, its high significance at once
recognised by the label “the Truman
doctrine,” and its vast design contained
in one word of one sentence:
I believe that it must be the policy of the
United States to support free peoples who are
resisting attempted subjugation by armed
minorities or by outside pressure. *
Krock reports that “must” was inserted
instead of “should” at the President’s ex-
press direction. And it must be ex-
tremely rarely that so much has ever been
packed into one.word. It plainly said
that failure to comply would leave the
responsibility for the world’s future
wholly on Congress.
Coinciding with this strong line
of leadership, the Gallup poll people
have reported that “few persons in poli-
tical life have had such a dramatic up-
swing in popularity as President Tru-
man!” This the poll people ascribe to
“the firm handling of John L. Lewis”
and “the proposal for a showdown with
Russia.”
The Doctrine’s Purpose
London “Times” accurately interpreted
the President’s announcement as meaning
that “a fundamental alteration in Ameri-
can foreign policy is involved rather than
an isolated and temporary response to
a request for aid.” In con-
trast to the Monroe doctrine,
which “introduced a long
century of exclusive preoccu-
pation with America’s own
backyard,” the Truman doc-
trine was seen as “opening a
door, rather than shutting
one.”
Still inclined to keep up its
war-time left-handed Mos-
cow crawl, London “Times”
further commented on the
new policy: “The danger
that it may yet be perverted
into a barren and restrictive
anti-Communist crusade
cannot be ignored; a ‘Red
scare’ is already in full swing
against Communists and
‘fellow-travellers’ in t.h e
American Administration
and the labor movement.”
As opponents and sup-
porters. alike in America
have recognised, the Truman
doctrine represents the very
opposite to that kind of
crawl. One thing that
might be said for the some-
what muted Thunderer is
that when J. Bull held the
outposts from which he is
retreating and into which it
js proposed Uncle Sam
should now move, American
criticism of J.B. was just as
ready and just as inane. But
if the muted Thunderer fears
to say “Russia” above a
scared whisper there is no
such craven trembling in the
U.S. The only question is whether action
from that quarter will fully measure up
to the high words.
In the protracted American discussion
of the proposed new policy Communism
and Communists figure only as acces-
sories—Communism because it controls
Russian policy, and Communists as a
criminal conspiracy of fifth-column
agents. The “Red scare” the old Thun-
derer muttered about is a logical recog-
nition of the need to hamstring the fifth-
columnists before coming to a peace-or-
war showdown with the foreign Power to
which they give their first loyalty.
The real issue, as the Thunderer’s leader
writer would know very well, is a de-
liberately contrived showdown with
Russia on balance of world power.
“What is intended,” says “World Re-
port,” “is unmistakable notice to the
Kremlin that the U.S. is now preparing
to use its resources to stop Russian expan-
sion and Communist infiltration.” As
that publication describes it, the reason-
ing behind “U.S. plans for action” is this:
Russia’s goal, whatever her timetable, is a
Communist world.
Russian leaders, ambitious and tightly or-
ganised, with Communism to sell, are set to
exploit discontent, to make gains at the ex-
pense of a weak Britain.
Russian methods are f those of infiltration,
operating through Communist parties, utilising
all the machinery of political propaganda and
agitation.
Russia is manoeuvring to gain strategic ad-
vantages in the Mediterranean, is able to exert
increasing pressure inside Greece and on Tur-
key’s borders.
It all adds up to a pattern of deliberate
expansion, of planned aggression. In this
situation the basic thought of U.S. officials is
to profit from the past, to try to do now what
the world failed to do before Japan went into
Manchuria in 1931, before Italy invaded
Ethiopia in 1935, befoae Germany reclaimed
the Rhineland in 1936 and annexed Austria in
1968. Those are views held by important
elements among the policy-makers. They are
arguments for acting immediately in an effort
to prevent a shooting war later on.
“As after the Napoleonic wars,” Wash-
ington “Post” has commented, “ ‘A Kal-
muck Prince is trying to overturn Europe.’
We have allowed the process to go on,
instead of stopping it as Castlereagh and
his colleagues did then (so giving Europe
a century of general peace).”
The cash cost of carrying the “Truman
doctrine” through has been assessed at
$21,000,000,000 in the next three years.
—Los Angeles “Times”
“WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?”
How vast the scope of the “doctrine” is
can be seen from the fact that the coun-
tries listed for aid in the assessment in-
clude, as well as Greece and Turkey,
Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Aus-
tria, China, Japan and Korea.
COSTS OF VICTORY.
What little Peterkin wanted to know
about Blenheim could be, and, in fact,
has been, asked much more pertinently
about what war has since become.
In America the sum total has been
put by N.Y. “Daily News” into a leader-
heading horselaugh: “To the Victors —
Haw, Haw!”
In quieter language Lord Beveridge
summed up for Britain in the House of
Commons: “It really is not possible for
this country to win a war. It can defeat
the enemy, but it is bound to lose by §my
war because its economic life depends on
the international co-operation of all
nations. So any war is bound to leave us
poorer with a harder life in the future.”
In its leader comment the N.Y. “Daily
News” contended that, though after
World War I “some money and coal
reparations were wrung out of Germany
.... .the spoils system was already coming
apart at the seams.” Pointing out that
“the reparations bills were never collected
in full; and a lot of U.S. private capital
wept into financing German recovery ;
and after a while Hitler came along and
repudiated these obligations,” the “Daily
News” declared that what has been hap-
pening “to the good old ‘to the victors
belong the spoils’ principle following
World War II is a caution”;
From Gen. Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo
came an alarmed plea to Congress not to cut
the Truman budget in such a way as to force
reduction of U.S. food supplies to defeated
Japan. To do that, MacArthur warned, might
throw Japan into the hands of the Communists,
who are already working like Trojans to lure
the 73,000,000 Japanese into the Russian orbit.
We’ve got to keep feeding them for a while,
MacArthur insists. To be sure, he also says
we’ll get the costs of all this food back even-
tually. We hope that’s true, but we’ll believe
it when and if it happens.
Secretary of State George C. Marshall said
much the same thing of defeated Germany.
So, as victors in our latest war, we are not
enjoying any spoils. On the contrary, we are
helping our recent enemies to get back on
their feet.
The “Daily News,” adding that the
only Allied nation now cashing in on
the spoils system is Russia, which “has
grabbed some 270,000 square miles of
territory and is now feverishly robbing
Eastern Germany and Austria of
machinery and technicians” and yet is
“squawking that it didn’t get all it should
have had out of the war,” concluded;
There may be good and sufficient reasons
for future war. But it looks as if the hope of
profit will never again be such a reason.
Another publication, the “United
States News”—sound on facts —has put
the cost to the U.S. in “gifts, loans, sur-
plus properties and lend-lease supplies”
since the end of the war at the almost
unbelievable total of $27,000,000,000.
And these credits “are declared to be
just a start.”
Despite that, the “United States News”
could point to something its daily con-
temporary overlooked —that today “the
United States is booming, with living
standards for many people higher than
ever before.” But even the U.S. could yet
suffer severely if all it has so far advanced
and will still have to shell out fails to get
the world going again in reasonable pros-
perity within a reasonable time.
It adds up to a sorry sum in which to
the victors in modern war belong the
headaches. Actually, theirs becomes the
job of footing the cost —where they are
qot too prostrate to do so. The only
sort of consolation they have is that it
would have been worse if they’d been the
vanquished.
STARVELINGS, ARISE.
According to one report from Moscow
when the peace treaty preliminaries were
being wrangled there, the Russians were
much impressed by the way the British
delegation rushed the reported plentiful
food available.
The feeling was that things must indeed
be bad in Britain. It, of course, went to
show the advantages of living under the
so much better Soviet system.
By way of contrast, a writer in the
“American,” William Drake, had earlier
made a like report, much more detailed,
of the Gargantuan appetites of Russian
U.N.O. delegates in the U.S. Quoting
“a reliable journalist who has just re-
turned from the Soviet Union” as re-
porting “millions of Russians at home
are existing on black bread and sauer-
kraut soup,” Drake commented that
“their top envoys over here live like
millionaires, and even the smaller fry in
the Soviet delegation appear to have un-
limited bank rolls and are behaving,

generally, like tenement kids turned loose
in a candy shop.’’
The “candy shops” they are turned
loose in are highly on the elaborate side
—as elaborate as can be obtained: “The
Muscovites show a distinct preference
for large and showy country homes on
the Long Island gold coast and for sump-
tuous town houses in the snootier neigh-
borhoods of uptown Manhattan.”
Apart from the Morgan 48 - room
house, with its Louis XV furnishings and
116 acres of gardens, over which there
was a rumpus because of the slummy
condition in which they eventually left
it, they have bought for Molotov’s oc-
casional use a Glen Cove place called
Killenworth, which “has been called
the most beautiful country home in
America.” If possible, even more mag-
nificent than the Morgan place, “it has
50 rooms, 35 bathrooms, marble stairs
and oak panelling imported from Europe,
both indoor and outdoor tennis courts,
wine cellars for the accommodation of
thousands of bottles, and an electrical
organ which was recently repaired for
the trifling cost of $40,000.”
Drake gives details of other such places,
at which “they still like to sing the ‘lnter-
nationale’ ” —it begins “Arise, ye starve-
lings, from your slumbers!” —adds that
“in their everyday life the Reds refuse to
have even a nodding acquaintance with
starvation once they come over here;
quite the contrary,” and reports an ex-
ample or two:
When Molotov visited the United States re-
cently the entertainment which was provided
for him would have done justice to a Roman
emperor. That was during the meat shortage,
when most American housewives were having
trouble buying half a pound of bologna, but
Molotov was welcomed at the New York con-
sulate with a buffet dinner which featured tables
groaning under sucking pigs with apples in their
snouts, enormous platters of salmon, mountains
of caviar, and cases of vodka, whisky and
champagne dispensed by liveried lackeys.
A similar shindig was thrown for Molotov
when he visited the Soviet Embassy in Washing-
ton, with whole turkeys and aspics featured in-
stead of pigs. And when the Foreign Minister
pursued his splendid progress to Glen Cove he
was welcomed, hot only with cheers from his
cohorts and thunderous organ music, but with
feasting which Glen Covers say started in the
morning and lasted all day. For days prior
to his arrival at Killenworth, indeed, truck-
loads of provisions of all kinds, including.cases
of costly French "wines and liqueurs, had been
delivered at the estate.
One thing that accounts for the plenti-
ful funds of any U.N.O. representatives
is that top screws and expenses are as
lavish as the taste that goes with them,
and the Russians on the job pay neither
Soviet nor American income tax. Also,
under the Soviet system, the aristocracy
—those in high posts—live as far removed
from the black bread and sauerkraut
soup of the millions as any Czarist aristo-
cracy ever did.
It’s all right as long as the starvelings
don’t take the opening line of the “Inter-
nationale” too literally.
DOUBLE-CROSS AWARD.
To the authentic inner history of the
war deals coming out has been added a
volume entitled Defeat in Victory, by
Jan Ciechanowski, war-time Polish Am-
bassador to the U.S.
Published in America, the book has
been described by the Scripps-Howard
foreign editor, William Philip Simms, as
“the full blistering story of the betrayal
and death of independent Poland at the
hands of her allies” and as revealing
“downright villainy and double-crossing
on the part of some of the .Big Three.”
George Creel, in N.Y. “World-Telegram,”
has spoken of it as “drastically revising
history—the author’s authoritative revela-
tions invalidate much of What has hitherto
been accepted as truth.”
Creel describes the author’s main pur-
pose as showing “the gradual evolution
of American and British relationships
with Russia, and how, under the pressure
of Soviet blackmail, what started as co-
operation degenerated into abject sur-
render. ... ,A moving picture of a heroic
people deserted and betrayed by allies
sworn to loyalty by explicit pieclges.”
At time of writing the book was not on
the Australian market; Creel, however,
drew directly on the book’s facts for his
review, from which the following are the
m’ain points:
In London in June, 1940, after the collapse
of France, where Poles had fought to the bitter
last, Ciechanowski watched Winston Churchill
clasp hands with Gen. Sikorski, Churchill
emotionally exclaiming, “We are comrades in
life and in death. We shall conquer together
or die together.”
Sent to Washington as Poland’s Ambassador,
Ciechanowski listened to Roosevelt’s praise of
Polish courage—“the one country that has not
produced a Quisling”—followed by warm assur-
ances by the President that neither he nor the
American people, would ever stand for any-
thing less than the full restoration of Poland’s
independence.
Equally fervent were the promises of Stalin.
When Poland offered aid at the time of the
German invasion, Russia unequivocally re-
linquished all claims to Polish territory that
had been seized by Red troops, and Stalin
personally pledged that peace-time relations
between the two countries would be based on
“neighborly collaboration.”
Instead of levelling charges of ill faith,
Ciechanowski simply records what happened in
the hour of victory when the many pledges
were to have been redeemed. Together with
Stanislas Mikolajczyk, the Polish Premier, he
saw President Roosevelt in June, 1944, and
tells how the two were lectured on Poland’s
“unreasonableness” in refusing to face the fact
that there were “five times more Russians than
Poles.” By way of emphasising the change in
White House attitude, this insulting cynicism
of Harry Hopkins is also set down: “The
Poles are like the Irish. You can never satisfy
them.”
Then follows an authenticated
transcript of the Moscow con-
ference, held on Oct. 12, 1944,
when Mikolajczyk, at President
Roosevelt’s insistence, met Stalin,
Churchill, Molotov, Eden and
Harriman. Straightway the British
Prime Minister and Stalin laid
down acceptance of the so-called
Curzon line as an ultimatum,
curtly overruling the objection
that this meant the loss of half
Poland, along with 13,000,000
Polish citizens. Mikolajczyk, con-
tinuing his protest, stated flatly
that such a settlement did not
have U.S. support.
“At this point,” to quote
Ciechanowski, “Molotov made a
surprising statement. He said that
he saw it was necessary to re-
mind those present that at Tehran
Roosevelt'had expressed his com-
plete agreement with the Curzon
line as the Polish-Soviet frontier,
and regarded it as a just solution,
and the President had merely
added that, for the time being, he
preferred that his agreement cn
this point should not be made
public. He (Molotov) then turned
to Churchill and Harriman, and
challenged them to deny his state-
ment. They did not do so.”
With Mikolajczyk still obdurate,
Churchill flew into a rage and
changed from pleas to threats. If
the Polish Premier continued to
shut his eyes to realities and re-
fused to play the game, he would
wash his hands of him.
Even while this meeting was
being held RooSevelt received a
delegation from the Polish-Ameri-
can Congress, and declared his
“abiding irfferest” in a free and
On Oct. 27
Ambassador Ciechanowski went
to the White House with a per-
sonal letter from Mikolajczyk,
asking if Molotov was correct.
Not until Nov. 17, well after the election, did
Roosevelt answer the letter, and then evasively.
At Yalta, however, he came out into the
open, specifically sanctioning Russia’s seizure
of East Poland, the one attempt to camouflage
being recognition of Poland’s‘right to a “rep-
resentative Government” and “free and un-
fettered elections. As Ciechanowski points
out, even this gesture was soon withdrawn,
for the Lublin Committee, made up of Polish
Communists long resident in Russia, was accep-
ted by the United States and Britain as a
“representative Government,” and there was
no protest when elections were postponed to
an indefinite date. [The elections have since
been held. They were anything but “free and
unfettered.”]
Particularly telling is the analysis of the
appeasement policy that placed Russia in a
privileged position, able to force submission
to demands even when they entailed the sur-
render of principles. Chiefly responsible was
Stalin’s constant threat to tdke Russia out of
the war, but largely contributory was the de-
velopment of a pro-Russian psychosis in the
United States, promoted by Henry Wallace and
the Office of War Information.
One by one the results are set down; Stalin’s
hindering of an army from the thousands of
Polish prisoners in Russia, and their retention
as slave labor ; the sudden disappearance of
some 8000 Polish officers, supposedly released
by Russia, and later found in a common grave;
the abandonment of promises to Mikolajczyk;
the arrest, trial and imprisonment of 16 leaders
of the Polish Underground, invited to Russia
with explicit pledges of safe conduct, and, as a
shameful climax, the tragedy of the Warsaw
uprising.
With the Russian army only nine miles from
Warsaw, the Moscow radio called on the Poles
to rise. General Bor heeded the appeal, and.
his forces seized half the city. Instead of
advancing, however, the Red troops sat still,
and watched battle, starvation and disease take
the heavy toll of 100,000 Polish lives. Even
more incredibly, the Russian commanders re-
fused the use of their near-by airfields, and
British, Polish and South African air crews
were compelled to fly supplies from distant
points.
In dealing with Mr. Truman, the book stresses
that the new President was entirely in the dark
as to Roosevelt commitments, and had to re-
tain the intimates of his predecessor as a matter
of necessity. These, of course, convinced him
that nothing must be allowed to disrupt Big
Three unity. Harry Hopkins, therefore, was
given a free hand when sent to Moscow, and
completed Poland’s betrayal by signing on
Stalin’s dotted lines. And mark Hopkins’s
tittered answer to Ambassador Ciechanowski’s
anguished protests: “We’ve got to get ready
for Roosevelt’s re-election in 1948.”
Finally the author of Defeat in Victory
looks at U.N.O. and, because of all this
double-crossing and all else of the heri-
tage on which U.N.O.’s shaky founda-
tions rest, he sees it “reduced to the
role of guard over a huge international
prison, in which previously free nations
find themselves locked up.”

Austerity All Right, But. —Commenting on a
London “New Statesman and Nation” article
in praise of the present British Government,
the “Saturday Evening Post” makes an interest-
ing point or two on austerity and all that:
“Britain’s present experiment with ‘austerity,’
which is a process for dividing inadequate pro-
duction among all the people, represents
economic convalescence rather than normal
functioning. Hence it is depressing to find the
‘New Statesman and Nation’ gloating over
Britain’s current gloomy condition as ‘so firmly
established that we tend to see its difficulties
and forget its benefits.’ To our way pf think-
ing, one of the misfortunes of current economic
discussion is the tendency to forget that .most
of the world is suffering from a horrible hang-
over. To cure this condition heroic measures
are to be expected, some sound and some
dubious even for a hangover. Thus Great
Britain, which has a perplexing problem to
solve because of her dependence on imports,
is forced to adopt controls and other expedi-
ents which are justified in an emergency, but
are hardly worth making into an ideology. A
man with a broken leg may use a wheelchair
until he can walk, but he would be foolish to
write, ‘After a month [n this wheelchair I am
determined never to return to those bad old
days when I travelled on foot.’ ”

Wailing Wall. No paper has published more
savage Zionist-sponsored anti-British propa-
ganda on Palestine than N.Y. “Post,” so it is
poetic justice on an unpoetical subject that
one of that newspaper’s columnists, Dorothy
Thompson, should point to an outcome that
wasn t counted on, touching Britain’s sending
of the problem to U.N.0.: “The Irgun Zionists
should celebrate a victory in Palestine, for the
victory is theirs. Getting Britain out of
Palestine has been the core of their pro-
gramme.... It has, indeed, been for Britain—
and not only for Britain—a ‘squalid’ affair
But there will be many Palestinian Jews to
whom the news will not be welcome. British
withdrawal may easily mean the beginning of
the end of the Jewish homeland, and of all
hope of establishing a Jewish State.” Other
American writers have been noting that the
thing most worrying the violent anti-British
propagandists is that now for the first time
America will hear something of the Arab case.
*** * ■ *
Europe-made, British-labelled. A curious
N.Y. “Journal of Commerce” tale about Scotch
water being sent to Europe and there turned
into whisky and exported about the world as
“Scotch” has not been denied, which is even
more curious. A further report in the same
paper is not so fantastic: “Since the end of
the war much of the exports bearing the British
label have been manufactured on the Continent,
principally in France and Italy, by companies
controlled by British capital. The finished pro-
duct is then shipped to Great Britain, where it
is further processed before being exported to
British foreign markets.” The same and other
American sources report that by such means
and its own heroic efforts, plus such other
causes as dollar troubles in possible market
countries, Britain is holding markets that
American interests were counting on sharing,
if not taking over.

Poland Under Communism. —Those who hold
that it is only a matter of time before the
Communism which Soviet Russia has projected
into adjoining countries collapses from its own
inherent defects would find support in a report
from Warsaw by the observant N.Y. “Post”
woman correspondent Dorothy Thompson.
Though Poland is now run by Communists and
is in the Soviet defence orbit, Miss Thompson
sees it as “terribly afraid to be cut off from
the cultural and economic life of the West.”
In its general atmosphere it is “not remotely
like the Soviet Union. Despite destruction,
poverty and fear, the atmosphere is vivacious.
There is none of the iconography that charac-
terises both the U.S.S.R. and Tito’s Yugoslavia.”
That is, the writer had yet to see a single
picture of Stalin, “and Beirut’s face, unlike
Tito’s, does not stare at one from every win-
dow.” Miss Thompson also surprisingly nbted
that “private enterprise, especially merchandis-
ing, flourishes,” and in regard to this: “Virtual
extermination of the Jews has sent Poles into
business; most of the remaining Jews have gone
into the mines or on to new farms.”
* * * *
Soviet Culture.—^ Taking up the claim that
millions more Russians today can read and write
than in the past, Eugene Lyons, outstanding
U.S. authority on Russia, points out in N.Y.
“World-Telegram” that “Literacy is a doubtful
boon when all printed matter is a Government
monopoly and the police are tireless in sup-
pressing ‘undesirable’ writings and thoughts.”
There are, Lyons allows, vastly more half-edu-
cated and quarter-educated people in Stalin’s
Russia than in the Russia of the Czars; there
are, however, “fewer fully-educated people”;
the number of these has “declined disastrously,”
and “continues to decline.” “Whether a million
peasants able to write their name makes up for
one Count Tolstoy allowed to write his thoughts
is a problem for philosophers; but they cannot
be Soviet philosophers—should they reach the
‘wrong’ conclusion they would end up in the
salt mines.” Reporting that only recently “there
has been an extensive purge of writers, musi-
cians and other artists,” Lyons adds: “All art,
science and education in Russia are in effect
dedicated to advertising. But instead of adver-
tising products, they advertise the official ideas
and policies of the Kremlin rulers.” It isn’t
enough to refrain from criticising. They don’t
“get off that easily.” They must glorify. And
“Every wave of purges devastates the ranks of
intellectuals and artists no less than the ranks
of officials and administrators.”
* * * *
Small-business Revives. Surveys made in-
dependently by three U.S. Government
economics departments have “upset the popular
conception, nurtured by some politicians and'
professional organisers, that the war dealt per-
manent injury to the little businessman and
fostered a huge monopolistic growth.” The
reports all show that “small manufacturers,
retailers and service trades operators generally
emerged from the war as healthy as their big
competitors. They have more than recovered
from their war-time mortality rate and now
are doing business in greater numbers than at
any time in history.” It is a triumph of free
enterprise—freer in America than anywhere else
today; pointed to as the reason why America
is today the most prospering country in the
world!

"DYING OF STARVATION."
Australians concerned at the plight of
their kinsfolk in Britain were horrified
when a London dietician, Dr. Franklin
Bicknell, came out with a statement on
their condition which he maintained in
spite of denials from interested parties:
England is dying of starvation. Everyone
in Britain is suffering from prolonged,
chronic malnutrition, which makes it physi-
cally impossible to work sufficiently hard
either to grow all the food possible or to
make the necessary exports to pay for im-
ported food All rationed and “points”
foods, less than 1600 calories a day, would
not keep an average citizen healthy if he
remained in bed all day and never moved.
It supports what Australian doctors
have been Saying and thoughtful laymen
fearing. Themselves well fed—though
sometimes compelled to do without some
foodstuff or other through strikes or
bureaucratic bungling —Australians could
not read of the British ration without
the uneasy conviction that no people,
however hardy, courageous and patient,
could remain 100 per cent, at that rate.
But over many months, though their own
feelings have been expressed in abundant
gifts of food and money, they have had
no leadership from the people in charge
at Canberra. In that quarter there was
instead sullen hostility to the cause they
had at heart, followed by indifference
and evasion when sullen hostility became
inexpedient, followed again by gestures
of belated sympathy which so far have
amounted to nothing.
At the end of 1945, when Food-for-
Britain appeals were launched by the
Lord Mayors of three capital cities and
Were instantly responded to by generous
citizens, Mr. Murphy, the Common-
wealth Food Controller, sounded a blast
over “national” stations. “Meats (other
than canned), fats, sugar, butter and pre-
served milks must not be bought from
food-appeal funds,” he ordered, and pur-
chases of dried and canned fruits would
be restricted:
The civilian consumer has a duty to
adhere strictly to all rationing conditions.
Funds raised by those appeals might, if
they became big, seriously deplete the sup-
plies of an important class of food avail-
able to Australian civilians. Everything
relating to food policy, including food sup-
plies for our own people and food exports
to Britain and other countries, must centre
in the efforts of the Government itself
People think that surrendered meat, sugar
or butter coupons should be used to buy
quantities of those foods to send independ-
ently to Britain. Such a course is imprac-
tical and undesirable.
The Lord Mayor of Adelaide had pre-
sently to announce, as a sequel to
a visit from Mr. Dedman, the Minister in
charge of Food Control, that his appeal
had perforce been closed “because of an-
tagonistic influences from outside the
State: my fund was informed that no
permits would be issued to it for buying
food.” He then made a stinging refer-
ence to the difference between the com-
mercial spirit, selling food to the British
at top prices, the “Labor” policy all along,
and the Christian spirit, giving the food.
Though nothing could sting Mr.
Dedman into active sympathy, his notions
about coupons were refuted by the Labor
Prime Minister of N.Z. At the launching
of a National Committee for “voluntary
saving of food for Britain,” Mr. Fraser
said that his Government had been defi-
nitely assured by the N.Z. Food Control
that direct saving of coupons would mean
direct increases of food for Britain, and
his Government would support the plan
to the limit. Mr. Dedman had asserted
that “the collection of coupons volun-
tarily unused and their use by any organi-
sation outside the Government for acquir-
ing food to send to Britain do not add
one ounce to the total quantities sent to
Britain.”
In May, 1946, the Australian Chester
Wilmot was heard from 8.8. C. saying
that the sacrifices being made by the
British to feed friends and late enemies
would mean that the British would have
less food than in* any of the six war years.
Meat and wharf strikes were then holding
up supplies and shipments in Australia ;
but from Canberra came only silence. In
mid-June there was an appeal from the
now-forgotten Mr. Forde to “workers
[i.e„ strikers] to co-operate in dispatching
food.” A month before that New Zea-
landers had surrendered, in the fifth week
of their national appeal, enough meat
and buffet coupons to make an extra
week’s ration for 250,000 people. The
Australian Prime Minister, back from a
flying visit to Britain, mumbled something
about things being “tough” there, but
let it go at that.
By the spring of 1946 vast numbers of
Australians were exasperated at their
Government’s attitude. Mr. White, of
the Opposition, crystallised public feeling
by asking the P.M. three questions in the
House: Had the Government acquired or
sent any gift food between 1943 and
1946? What had South Africa and New
Zealand done? Would the Government
consider a food gift worth £2,000,000 to
the British? The answers by Mr. Chifley
were: (1) No. (2) He had no official in-
formation about S.A. and N.Z. (3) No.
In October, 1946, grateful letters
addressed to the Prime Minister were
arriving from England from people who
didn’t know the names and addresses of
the real donors —to their everlasting credit
the ordinary citizens of Australia main-
tained the sending of food parcels despite
Government indifference and thumping
postal charges—and the P.M. handed
parcels of these letters to the newspapers,
cashing in on the philanthropy of the
anonymous.
The close of 1946 and the beginning of
1947 brought unprecedented disasters to
the British. Snowstorms, gales and
blizzards locked the country in an appall-
ing freeze. Transport by land and sea
was stopped, fuel and lighting were cut
off, industries closed down; fields, towns
and cities were blanketed under ice and
snow. But if Canberra was impressed
it made no sign—indeed, the Mayors of
Sydney and Melbourne had to announce
the closing of their food funds for lack
of donations, an event from which they
were saved by responses from their
people.
By March this year Britain was in even
worse straits, for enormous floods had
succeeded the freeze, and thousands of
acres of food crops and millions of sheep
and cattle were washed away. All Aus-
tralia stood aghast at the dreadful reports,
as they came, day by day, through press
and radio. At Canberra Dr. Earle Page
moved for a Commonwealth gift of
£25,000,000-worth of food to Britain, and
was ready to demonstrate that it could
be done without affecting the Australian
dietary. His motion was “gagged” thrice
in five days.
Then the inevitable appeared. There
was a 23 p.c. to 28 p.c. increase in deaths
during the awful storm-bound weeks. In
some districts the deaths totalled 30,500
more than in the same period of 1946,
when there was an influenza epidemic.
Dr. Bicknell’s statement is but a continua-
tion of the terrible story, which stirred
the Australian people to fresh efforts. A
Red Cross flood-relief fund got an instant
and heaftening response ; a great impetus
was given to the sending of food parcels:
from graziers in aH States came offers of
free meat —initiated by a gift of 1500 fat
lambs from a group of Digger farmers.
The old generous Australian spirit was
strongly in motion.
And the Commonwea’th “Govern-
ment” bestirred itself at last. Oh, yes, it
bestirred itself—by appointing a “Cabinet
sub-committee”! The Cabinet sub-com-
mittee met. Presumably it deliberated.
Presently Mr. v Pollard, the Minister for
Agriculture and Commerce, was heard
saying that it recommended no reduction
in the Australian food ration.
About this time elections were due in
two States. Apparently it was necessary
to display some interest in the British
people. Mr. Chifley displayed it. He
announced that “people who want more
food to go to Britain can achieve this
end by a little sacrifice. If they are de-
termined not to use all their coupons the
saving would be very considerable and
would provide an additional surplus for
export.”
A complete contradiction of what Mr.
Dedman said in Adelaide. A complete
reversal of the rebuff administered to
the Lord Mayor of Brisbane when he
suggested the voluntary surrender of
meat and butter coupons, realising—as
did his brother in Adelaide, —that many
good people could help in no other way.
The elections are over. Two days be-
fore they were held Mr. Pollard said that,
though there would be no cut in the Aus-
tralian ration, his Government would
launch an appeal for the saving of food
for Britain and a “meat scheme.” When
pressed as to the nature of the “meat
scheme” he could say only that it was
“in embryonic form,” and that a whole
£lO,OOO had been “set aside” by the
“Government” —“set aside” to “cover
not only Meat Board activities, but
coupon-saving, coupon-collecting, meat-
less days and general propaganda,” Ten
thousand for all that!
Meanwhile Mr. Strachey, the British
Food Minister, whose Administration,
, though Labor, has no patience with
strikes anywhere, stated that “normal
meat shipments from Australia are a
month behind schedule because of Austra-
lian waterfront strikes.” Here again there
were denials from interested parties, one
a leader of the conspiracy which has made
lying part of its system and practice.
A Form of Civil War.
After all the felicitations and recrimina-
tions on the collapse of the Victorian
strike the crude truths remain that it was
a deliberate attack on the economic life
of the community, pressed home with all
the ruthlessness of an enemy waging war
on the Commonwealth, and that the
‘ ‘Labor’ Governments” in Melbourne anc
Canberra refused to take any action of
their own to defend the public or even to
carry on Government transport services.
That the union chiefly concerned had
a grievance, not against the employers
concerned, whose hands were tied by
Federal “Labor” policy, but against the
authors of that policy, was something
that became submerged in the graver
issue. That the union also had previously
a good industrial record only deepened
the offence in its defiance of authority.
The whole story of the strike is the more
challenging because it followed a course
set previously by other union executives
whose rebellion against authority is a
planned course under the direction of
Communist, or near-Communist, leaders.
Federal and State “ ‘Labor’ Govern-
ments” have now ample notice, with no
excuse for further doubt, of the industrial
insurgence they are called upon to meet.
For there is every sign that this strike is
not the end of the post-war series.
While it was doing immense damage in
Victoria, and not in Victoria alone, Mr.
Holt appealed to the “Government” to
take action against “an industrial rebel-
lion.” “Poor old Holloway,” the Minister
put up to reply, admitted that the mem-
ber for Fawkner had stated the facts, and
allowed that “something” would “have
to be done —by someone ” within a week
or “the position” would “become most
serious.” That was on March 21, Not
until four weeks later was the A.E.U.
deregistered in the Arbitration Court. In
those proceedings this exchange (“S.M.
Herald” report) ensued:
Foster, J.: You have two courses—hold-
ing the community to ransom or coming to
the Court —and you chose the former.
Mr. Mundy (for the A.E.U.): Well, that’s
the position if put bluntly.
A week later the A.C.T.U. executive,
which fluttered about as weakly as the
Cain “Government” and was by the union
treated with equal contempt, declared
from a special meeting in Sydney that
“the dispute in Victoria threatens the
economic life of the community.” Still
both the Chifley and Cain Governments
remained passive. And to the inertia of
their crowd where public rights and in-
terests were concerned. Federal Ministers
added a new submission to strike pro-
moters and mobs.
On the very day of the A.C.T.U.
declaration Mr. Calwell announced from
the Ministerial front bench that his “Gov-
ernment” was about to repeal two
Sections of the Crimes Act, which
provided that (1) “if at any time the
Governor-General is of opinion that there
exists.... a serious industrial disturbance
threatening trade or commerce among the
States he may make a proclamation to
that effect,” and that (2) “any person
during the operation of that proclama-
tion who takes part in or incites con-
tinuance of a strike preventing the trans-
port of goods or passengers may, on
conviction, be imprisoned for a year, and
if not born in Australia deported.” Next
day Mr. Dedman said that, while he “re-
gretted” that the engineers had “not ac-
cepted the Commissioner’s award,” he
would not “impose on anybody else the
obligation to follow the decision of a
Conciliation Commissioner or even of
the full Arbitration Court,”
When these incitements to insurgence
were uttered not only had the strike laid
idle Victorian transport and industry, but
the strike leaders were summoning
unionists in adjacent States to join them
—this in answer to the Court’s deregis-
tration proceedings. And the State sec-
retary of the Australian Railways Union
had usurped functions of the Victorian
“Government” by issuing “permits”
allowing buses to travel off their normal
routes. Meanwhile" Mr. Cranwell, chair-
man of the strike council, who is also
op the A.C.T.U. executive, twitted
A.C.T.U. president Clarey, who is also a
member of the Victorian Cabinet,
with impotence in his dilemma, and
charged him with conducting “an un-
principled sell-out of our struggle.”
Going further, Mr. Cranwell called
Premier Cain “a typical politician,” and
told the press that “this time we’ll win
or we won’t work” —or let anybody else
work. Mr. Cain' responded by refusing,
as “unwise,” Parliamentary demands that
he should invoke the Public Safety Act.
By May Day, the date for which the
A.C.T.U., with Minister Clarey, had
earlier given its blessing to an Australia-
wide stoppage of work and later found
good reasons for going cold on the idea,
it was high time that, in the words of
Mr. Holloway seven weeks earlier,
“something” was “done by someone.”
The thing done, and by Mr. Cain, was to
ask the Chief Judge to call a conference
of the parties, and apparently only the
manifest exhaustion of public patience
and “Labor’s” election alarm in N. S.
Wales produced even that move. By that
time Melbourne had been for 40 days
without publicly-owned buses and 19
days without any suburban trains,
and country train services had been
cut by half for weeks. And Mr.
Clarey, this time as Minister of Labor
and Industry, was “appealing” to tram-
waymen, who were keeping going the
only normal transport moving in Mel-
bourne, to ignore circulars, distributed
by the railway and ironworkers’ unions,
calling on them to make common cause
with the engineers and metal workers.
The record of “ ‘Labor’ Governments’ ”
impotence during this strike deserves to
be studied in detail. It is highly important
that the public should appreciate that,
while some industrial unrest in this post-
jvar transition period is„ inescapable,
especially when “Labor” taxation remains
terrific and when wharfies are making far
more than artisans, unrest is being turned
into a condition tending perilously to-
wards a state ofi civil war through the folly
and cowardice of “ ‘Labor’ Governments.”
The refusal of Canberra to intervene
against the Communist-controlled mari-
time unions’ ban on Dutch ships and
against the waterside stoppages, which
have held up food cargoes for Britain—a
refusal expressed as based, not on leaving
the issue to the Court, but on fear of
provoking (save the mark!) a general
strike—has been lustily exploited by the
militants, and touched bottom in the un-
resisted Victorian anarchy. It is now
abundantly clear that the Chifley “Gov-
ernment’s” unwillingness to enforce its
authority against the wreckers in one
union after another has not only not
avoided general strikes, but is encourag-
ing them. Already another upheaval
planned for May 12 and now “post-
poned” is mooted by a dozen key unions
in Australia-wide industry in rejection of
the Arbitration Court’s recent com-
promise awards on Saturday and Sunday
overtime rates. “Satisfaction of full de-
mands by May 12 or else.. was the
threat a fortnight ago, and whether the
discomforted A.C.T.U, can put the brakes
on a still bigger and better industrial
rebellion than that staged in Victoria
remains to be seen.
When, in all conscience, is this assault
on Australia’s economic life to be met
and thrown back? Mr. Menzies very
properly indicts “this claptrap about the
right to strike being sacred.” It is, in-
deed, an abuse of language. There is no
“tyrannical employer” as a strike target.
Employers are strangled under import
and export regulations, prices commis-
sioners, crippling company taxation and
bureaucratic doling out of materials; in-
dustry is disordered under the meddling
of armies of Government servants; and
the “boss” against whom unions are
conducting the idiotic “class war” is the
new-model Socialist Government. Along
with their strike policy, adopted from
the Communists, unions are pursuing the
parallel idiocy of restricting production
to a minimum on jobs where work is per-
mitted to continue. No increase in wages
can possibly benefit union members under
this suicidal behavior. They are but
digging in advance the grave of the pros-
perity they seek, and the grave, too, of
their own organisations. If another de-
pression comes “Labor” itself will in-
dubitably have made it.
The pity of it is that this stupid lam-
ing of Australian enterprise, individual
and national, is being preached among
the unions as some sort of religion at a
time when Australia is presented with an
unexampled opportunity to take a high
place in the post-war manufacturing and
trading world. The ravages of the war
in overseas countries have caused a de-
mand for our farm produce and for the
output of the secondary industries
already established here and of the new
ones asking to be admitted, which would
make this country unprecedentedly rich
and prosperous within a decade; and of
this prosperity unionists would receive a
great share, which would be greater still
if taxes were reduced to the Canadian
level. The development offered us would
also enhance our Strength in numbers
and in working energy and enable us to
emulate Canada’s amazing strides to-
wards the maximum of self-sufficiency
and the status of world power.
But “Labor” is throwing the oppor-
tunity away. The destiny of Australia
counts for nothing against “the right to
strike” —which means the power of a
minority to force the majority to strike.
If our children and our children’s
children are not to curse us, then, as the
ineffectual Holloway said in his midnight
weariness, “something will have to be
done by someone.” It can be done only
by his “Government,” and that means
that it won’t be done while an unaroused
people is content t@ let the “Govern-
ment” govern, in its crazy fashion, only
those who are willing to be governed,


PLAIN ENGLISH
"Great 'Labor' Victories."
Queensland has had another lesson in
the ignoble art of winning a majority of
Parliamentary seats with a minority of
votes in the constituencies. As before,
the lesson was furnished by “Labor,”
which has been in office, and thus in con-
trol of all electoral arrangements, since
1915, save for one Parliamentary term,
1929-1932.
There are 62 Queensland Assembly-
men. Fourteen will go in as minority
representatives. For the rest, nearly all
the big polls and majorities were on
the Opposition side. Opposition votes
of 8,000, 9,000 and 10,000 were registered.
Very few successful “Labor” candidates
can claim to represent more than 5000
electors and votes of 3000 or less sufficed
to return a parcel of Pledge-and-Caucus
men. In the result their party will re-
main on the Treasury benches with a
voting strength of 34. About 20,000 votes
down in city and country, it would be
over-represented with 28 members in
Opposition.
There was no such disparity in votes
between “Labor” Ministry and Lib.-C.P.
Opposition in N. S. Wales ; but had all the
seats been contested it is improbable that
“Labor” could claim a majority of elec-
tors’ suffrages. Almost all its 1944
majorities were reduced, in most cases
heavily, where they did not disappear. In
clean-cut contests between Ministry and
Opposition all the large majorities went to
Opposition candidates. For example, Mr.
Treatt was 10,000 ahead of “Labor” in
Woollahra, Mr. Black in Neutral Bay
and the Storey-Blaxland pair in Hornsby.
In other constituencies the “Labor” ad-
vantage was so small that the votes of
servicemen in Japan, disgracefully de-
prived of their civil rights as volunteers,
might have made all the difference. For
this reason and for other reasons,
“Labor” goes back with a majority which,
on its record and on votes polled, taking
in electorates which were rotten-ripe for
redistribution, it did not deserve.
One probable result of these burlesque
elections will be a revival of the move-
ment for new States. Dr. Page has
pointed out that the N.S.W. people north
of Newcastle cast an overwhelming vote
against “Labor,” which drew nearly all
its support from Sydney and Newcastle
regions, and from a few scattered electo-
rates such as Cobar and Broken Hill. And
the same is true, though not to so great
an extent, of the Riverina. In the U.S.A.
it has long been recognised that the proper
working of the Federal system depends
on the admission of new States formed
out of Federal territories or separated in
a normal fashion from existing units
which have become excessive. Recogni-
tion of this truth is so universal through-
out the Union that it will not be long
before Alaska achieves Statehood with a
white population of 40,000.
Provision for new States was made in
the Commonwealth Constitution, with
checks which have become outmoded,
though not incapable of alteration. Since
the time when our Federation was sanc-
tioned, or was about to be sanctioned,
ten of the 48 States have been set up in
the U.S.A.: Washington, Montana,
Wyoming, Idaho, North Dakota, South
Dakota, Utah, Oklahoma, New Mexico
and Arizona (the last in 1912). We still
have six States, as in 1901. With the
aggrandisement of the big cities,
which have drawn to themselves
excessive population and power—
power in new and ugly forms—the asser-
tion of local self-governing rights by
great parts of Australia like New Eng-
land and the Riverina is overdue. Their
rights gained, the hardy Riverina and
New England people could be trusted to
provide against such “jokes” as rigged
boundaries, stuffed rolls and multiple
voting.
Routed, But Still Rampant.
Melbourne got full and precise news-
paper accounts of the polling in Queens-
land. In spite of their State’s geographi-
cal connection and common interests
with Queensland, Sydney’s three Sunday
papers and four daily papers denied their
readers this information, giving them only
scraps. As usual they all carried pages
of sporting stuff.
One result of this travesty of journalism
was that the Communists were able to
get away, at least for a time, with the
printed lie that their solitary member,
Paterson, of Bowen, had “easily retained
his seat.” Actually, his 1944 total
slumped, and he had only 3034 votes out
of 7555 counted. At neither election
could he-have got in if “Labor,” to serve
its own undemocratic purposes, had not
abolished preferential voting for first-
past-the-post. Of his companions on the
Communist ticket, Julius scored 419 votes
out of 8967 in Baroona, Falls 810 out of
6597 in the Tableland, Clubley 1113 out
of 8420 in Kennedy and Sullivan 1748
of 8046 in Herbert—a fall from 3261 out
of 7592 in 1944.
Worse befell the Communists in N. S.
Wales, where they ran 16 candidates, 14
of whom lost their deposits. Compared
with 1944 results, their party vote was
down everywhere, 50 p.c. in some cases,
and more in others. The worst knocks
were reserved for their leaders. When
18,154 votes had been counted in Red-
fern, Miles, the Communist party secre-
tary, had a beggarly 1158. Moran’s share
of 18,236 votes in Balmain was 1654, and
Ogston’s allotment of 23,419 in Lakemba
was 1780. Even the “glamorous” Billy
Wood, a leader of the so-called State
“Labor” party when the Communists
were under the Menzies ban, got only
1081 out of 24,804 in North Sydney.
Nevertheless, the Sunday May Day
“rally” in Sydney found the Communists
as large as life. In the “Tribune” it is
recorded that “Mr. Miles congratulated
the Government on its election win,”
which, he said, “was largely due to the
progressive policy of Mr. McGirr, as com-
pared with A.L.P. timidity in West and
South Australia.” The chief marshal for
the occasion was the Communist Norman
Jeffery, who has figured in many lost
elections. It was an anti-American and
anti-British show, but this did not pre-
ONE MORE KNOCKOUT.
“At 36, Ron Richards, the best boxer in his division since Darcy, has had to be placed
in custody by the Sydney police for his own protection. The N.S.W. workers’-compensation
law, a Tabor’ measure, does not apply to pugilists.”
vent Mr. Ward joining with Mr. Miles
to spout to the comrades.
Mr. Menzies came in with an acute
comment on these proceedings and other
proceedings. He said “The Catholic
Church has fought Communism from
the outset, and—l say this as a Presby-
terian--! give it full marks for the fight.
Now in the industrial world Communism
is being based on a rampant sectarian
brawl. This kind of nonsense illustrates
the cunning of the Communist machine,
which is aiming to split the people by
sectarianism.” In this it repeatedly fails
at general elections, and its last failure
was its worst. But Communist sectarian-
ism is still having a malignant measure
of success at union elections and in the
general affairs of industrial organisations
and those of the Commonwealth itself,
largely because Catholic “Labor” poli-
ticians and union officials prefer trailing
along with the enemies of their country
and religion to fighting them.
Last week, when the State election re-
sults exhibited the Communists as a con-
temptible rabble, Mr. Kennelly, the Vic-
torian Minister of Works, following the
Communist boss Brown, of bus-permit
notoriety, declared a boycott of the
“Argus,” going to the length of depriving
it of Government advertisements. The
Chifley Government, having brazened out
the war-time C.S.I.R. appointment of the
Communist Rudkin, jailed in Westralia
and recommended for internment for the
duration, brazened out a £4OO Literary
Fund grant to the former Communist
propagandist Rawling. Mr. Chifley said
he wasn’t going to rake the sewers in
search of Communists or look under the
bed, as others did. His older and wiser
opposite number in Canada didn’t have
to resort to either of these operations. He
found Communists in Government de-
partments and laboratories and one in
the Parliament at Ottawa, all spying and
plotting for Russia.
As the week closed Communists let it
out that they were going to boycott the
building work on the Anglo-American
rocket range. A supreme example of
their Sovietist insolence and a calculated
consequence of “Labor” weakness and
folly.
Tragedy in Queensland.
In accidents and in the larger catastrophes
of fire and flood the Australian is never
found wanting. Whatever the emergency,
courage, readiness to assist and take risks
in doing so, sympathy and care for the
afflicted, he has at command. These
qualities came out again in the tragedy
that befell a picnic train in Queensland
when, for some as yet unknown reason,
portion of it jumped the rails, carriages
were telescoped and 16 people were
killed and 30 injured. The engine-driver
and fireman are among the dead.
It was Queensland’s worst railway ac-
cident, and it happened at a time when
the Government railways, not yet re-
covered from the strain of war and vast
military movement, were striving desper-
ately to maintain services in the face of
lack of men and material for repair,
maintenance and building of rolling
stock and lines. In 1946 the Commis-
sioner pointed out that, whereas in the
war years every engine, truck and carriage
which could be run with safety were
pressed into service, -efforts to repair and
rebuild the strained system have been
“frustrated to a considerable extent” by
man and material shortages. Further,
the railways have had to, carry on with
coal which was seriously failing in both
quantity and quality. The State Auditor-
General noted that of £3,350,000 set aside
for post-war railways reconstruction only
£305,556 had been spent, doubtless be-
cause of the lack of men and materials.
How far these factors affected the ac-
cident, if they affected it at all, should
come out at the inquiry. But there has
risen an uneasy feeling in Queensland
and elsewhere as to the continued safety
of other public enterprises, which must
suffer through the long parade of disas-
trous strikes and hold-ups afflicting the
country, to say nothing of the deadening
hand of bureaucratic “controls.” The
Queensland tragedy is lightened only by
the courage of the victims and the toil
and speed of their rescuers.
Anglo-Australian War Debts.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton
has bluntly spoken his piece about
Britain’s “unjust and unreal” war debts
with sterling-group countries. Washing-
ton made it a condition of the British
loan agreement that these debts shall be
scaled down.
In the First World War Father Bull
met, without asking for a penny of re-
payment, the cost of all military equip-
ment and ammunition used by Australian
troops in the field. In 1921 he agreed
to the funding of Australia’s remaining
him ’ a PP r °ximately
ty2,U(X),OOO, tor repayment in annual
sums of principal and interest over 55
years. In 1931, when the Commonwealth
was in financial difficulties, representa-
tions made in London resulted in the
British Government suspending payments
of principal and interest, and they have
not since been renewed. The balance of
war debt owing under the 1921 arrange-
ment was in that year just short of £BO
millions. The relief has been worth £7
millions a year for 15 years.
In the same depression year the British
Government acquiesced in Australian
Treasury representations for conversion
of other loan debt at a reduction in in-
terest rates. The relief thus granted
(especially valuable in the period 1932-34)
has resulted in an annual saving, includ-
ing exchange, to the Australian Budget
of another three to four millions a year
for the same period, or most of it.
Britain, in short, let us off our war
debt when we were hard up, and the
assistance has been worth to us 10 to 11
millions a year for 15 years. There is
still £BO millions of war debt unredeemed.
The sterling debt we hold against Britain
on account of World War Two is about
£l7O millions, and our total credits in
London are about £223 millions. We
cannot possibly recover payment;
America objects, and anyway, Britain’
hard put to it in every way, cannot find
the money.
Why not cancel the war debts on each
side? That would apparently still leave
us with £53 millions of funds in London
to meet any emergency against which the
Treasury likes to be prepared.
Landed—One Small Fish.
How the new tyranny does enjoy possess-
ing a giant’s strength and using it like a
giant! Using it at the expense of little
people, while the new rich, the new aris-
tocracy of blackmarketeers, laugh at the
whole outfit.
The Prices Commission descended on
a Bondi (Sydney) dressmaker in a small
way of business. It examined 150 “items”
in her shop (all marked) and seized five
(5) articles. Three of the five were priced
at under the Government’s figure, bring-
ing a gross benefit to the purchaser of
15s. 3d. Two frocks were overpriced, to-
gether 2s. Id. over what the regulations
said they ought to fetch.
Leaving the scene of the crime with
five articles and a net advantage, as pur-
chasers, of 13s. 2d., the agents of the new
tyranny prosecuted her in the Special
Federal Court, and the magistrate re-
flected his view of the heinousness of the
crime by imposing fines and costs
amounting to £lO 18s.
Now will the Prices Commission, re-
freshed as it doubtless is with satisfaction
in a good job done, tell us when it is
going to uncover the blackmarket in
housing timber and whether investiga-
gations have yet produced any proof or
disproof of recent charges in Parlia-
ment concerning “protected trades-
people”?
Russia Against the World.
With the issue of the first report of the
U.N.O. Military Staff Committee show-
ing the impossibility of present agreement
between the Western Powers and the
Russia group on the organisation of an
international police force, the question
arises whether U.N.0., as at present con-
stituted, can become any better surety
for the preservation of world peace than
was the League of Nations.
Russia’s refusals to co-operate now
present a formidable list. The Soviet
Government has declined to participate
in:
U.N.R.R.A. relief and rehabilitation.
The World Bank and Monetary Fund
(Bretton Woods).
The World Trade Conference.
The International Aviation Convention.
The U.N.O. Trustee Council.
Atomic Bomb control.
World disarmament.
An international police force.
A four-Power treaty of mutual guarantee
against Germany.
And Russia has refused to abandon or
to modify its Security Council veto, which
it invokes whenever the numbers are
against it.
As the recent abortive Moscow Con-
ference shows, Russia is also unwilling
to assist in any present settlement for
Germany, or to make any advance to-
wards a settlement for Austria, because
that would involve withdrawal of Red
Army occupation forces from the Danu-
bian countries. Russia is standing out
for its own benefits solely from any such
settlements, regardless of the effect of
delays upon the welfare of central
Europe.
The thorny questions of free naviga-
tion of the Danube, the future of the
Dardanelles, the disposal of Italian
colonies and the reconstruction of Man-
churia and Korea remain unsolved.
United Nations Assembly and Council
sessions seem destined to become mere
stormy debating platforms, ineffectual for
any decisions.
In these circumstances the question
must arise whether the rest of the world’s
nations shall not set up their own organi-
sation without Russia and its rabble of
police States, and unite their forces to
maintain peace, if that should be neces-
sary.

CARRERAS LTD. - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
w
POLITICAL POINTS
Queensland “Labor” has got in again
on a minority vote. It was helped to
this consummation by electoral boundaries
which in some cases were shaped like a
dog’s hind-leg. It has long parted com-
pany with equal electorates, one-vote
one-value and majority representation.
These expedients have served it pretty
well, but in the long run they will prove
disastrous.
“Out of sight, out of mind” is the
motto of N.S.W. “Labor” politicians con-
cerning servicemen and ex-servicemen ;
so they didn’t bother to take the votes
of the 4000 N.S.W. men in the Occupa-
tion Force in Japan. Hanlon did not
forget the civil rights of the Queens-
landers in 8.C.0.F., nor was Wise in-
attentive to those of the Westralians,
comparatively few as they were. Wise’s
Government was not the worst of the
“Labor” chain which the South Austra-
lians, in contempt of Chifley’s injunction,
refused to complete, though it was fated
to suffer the worst rebuff.
Sixty hours before he was to have been
hanged for murder, T. J. Ley was com-
mitted to the asylum at Broadmoor,
two doctors having pronounced him in-
sane “at the present time and at the time
of the crime.” It will be awkward if he
tries to bring actions against newspapers
which blithely insinuated that he made
away with the 22-years-missing McDonald,
his predecessor as M.H.R. for Barton
(N.S.W.). English libel law admits of
lunatics suing. The Felony Act says “no
action at 1aw.... .for the recovery of any
property, debt or damage whatever shall
be brought by any convict sentenced to
death while he shall be subject to the
operation of this Act,” But Ley is to be
held at Broadmoor “not as a convicted
murderer, but as a patient under treat-
ment,” detained during the King’s
pleasure and dischargeable if cured. It
has already been established that an Aus-
tralian newspaper may be sued in an
English Court for a libel published in
Australia.
To T. G. Davies, W.A. “Labor’s”
campaign director, was assigned the
melancholy task of reviewing the State
election in the post-mortem manner. He
gave it as his “considered opinion” that
“thousands of workers, many of whom
must have been Government employees,
voted against ‘Labor’ candidates.” So
it was in Queensland, and, to a lesser
extent, in N. S. Wales, though iff these
States the consequences were not so
dire. Mr. Davies suggested no remedy,
contenting himself with the dolorous
statement that “lots of people have very
short memories of the hardships endured
during 1931-33.”
There is no luckier “Labor” member in
the business than Abram Landa. Behind
on primaries in 1944 and 1947, he won
Bondi on each occasion because the
Opposition had made a poor choice of
candidates. His opponent in the latest
instance was a gentleman who is secre-
tary of a couple of coalmine proprietors’
associations. The issue depended on the
preferences of Lang “Labor” voters, and
naturally he couldn’t get sufficient.
The Libs, wasted the ex-servicemen
Watson and Paget in forlorn-hope con-
tests, though they polled uncommonly
well. Run for Bondi, either would have
relegated Landa to his law practice. As
it is he has qualified for a life pension
of £5 a week whenever he chooses to
avail himself of the privilege.
One of those commentators has found
fault with Hamilton, M.H.R., on the
score of his style, accusing him of being
overfond of cliches. It is a very minor
blemish in a House where there are so
many stumbling speakers, at times unin-
telligible, and it is altogether pardonable
in a new member who has already shown
himself quick on the uptake. Blithering
in defence of his “Government” and its
taxes, Dedman said thfcre were “almost
60,000 jobs without men to fill them.”
In the early ’thirties there was a calami-
tous fall in the birthrate, and this is affect-
ing today’s manpower position.
Pouncing on the fatal flaw in the argu-
ment, Hamilton pointed out as soon as
he got the call that the oldest “man”
born or unborn during the depression
would be fully 16.
According to a statement in the Com-
mons the number of British people in
India, including armed forces, is about
110,000. ’ The pre-war total of civilians
was reckoned at 40,000, but “this figure
has probably declined by several thou-
sands.”
Melbourne is still talking of the May
Day procession, with its representatives
of Albanian, Macedonian, Greek and
Jewish organisations, its A.R.U Soviet
banner, its comic band, which in-
sisted on playing “John Brown’s Body”
in the vicinity of the Communist boss
Brown, and its phalanx of 100 church-
men marching in the wake of the retired
Dean Langley. A bishop’s son, the ex-
dean is a Christian Socialist, who hopes
and believes that when the New Order
comes in religion and Socialism will be
found marching hand in hand, just as
they do in Russia.
Local-government bodies in S.A., Vic-
toria and N.S.W. don’t intend to take
without argument the “Labor” ukase as
to where they must do their banking.
Chifley had hardly finished saying that
he was ordering 200 of them to transfer
their accounts to the Commonwealth
Bank when the N.S.W. Local Govern-
ment Association announced that it had
got legal opinion and would contest the
ukase. Constitutional section 51 author-
ises Parliament to “make laws for the
peace, order and good government of the
Commonwealth with respect to
(XIII) banking, other than State bank-
ing ; also State banking extending be-
yond the limits of the State concerned.”
It does not authorise Parliament or any
of its instruments to deprive any muni-
cipal or shire council or road board of a
right exercised before there was a Com-
monwealth.
Before polling day “S. M. Herald”
summed up McGirr as a “spurner of
McKell moderation,” a projector of “a
promised land full of sunshine, ease and
sectional benefits,” and a leader whose
imaginative flights were justified by
neither his own record as Housing
Minister nor the present outlook. “It
would be a sorry commentary upon the
credulity of the community,” said the
“Herald,” were McGirr to succeed in “so
brazen an attempt” to hocus the people.
Now, facing the sorry commentary
erected in wood and stone, so to speak,
the “Herald” contents itself with the re-
flection that whatever is, is best, and
that “in tackling his onerous tasks Mr.
McGirr will need, and should be given
by Caucus, the strongest Cabinet material
available.” Talking about sorry com-
mentaries . . .
Engineers and railwaymen workers
resumed at Newport powerhouse last
week and electric trains started to run
again in Melbourne after 24 days’ en-
forced rest. The metal-trades, out of
action for five months, are resuming
slowly. One ironworker admitted to a
loss of £l5O in wages, but others haven’t
been badly hit. Union officials who were
pleased that thousands of their members
got other jobs from employers that asked
no questions are now perturbed at the
possibility that many may decline to re-
turn to their former jobs and unions,
one estimate placing the figure at 14,000.
Though the A.L.P. in S.A. (as in Vic-
toria) refused to have anything to do with
the May Day march while Communists
were associated with it and warned all
A.L.P. members accordingly, the mob of
Commos and near-Commos running the
show claimed to have a message of good-
will from Chifley, and quoted this gem
from “poor old Holloway”: •
For many years the organised workers
everywhere have held great mass May Day
demonstrations under the pure red flag
It was meant to be the house flag of the
international movement not a flag of any
one nation.
With a hammer-and-sickle in the corner,
of course.
Since Federal “Labor” is so cold to-
wards the Food-for-Britain movement, it
might be possible to warm it up with a
Food-for-Beasley movement. It is little
more than a year since the Beasleys went
to London, and by now they and friends
must have eaten and drunk their way
through the seven 701 b. bags of sugar,
the two chests of tea, the 13 cases of
canned vegetables, the 10 cases of jam,
the 39 cases of canned fruits, the six
cases of fruitjuices, the three cases of
canned meats, the two cases of tinned
soup, the three cases of prunes and three
of lexias, the eight cases of cream, con-
densed and dried milk, malted milk and
Milo, and the 25 cases of wines. The
thought of Beasley sadly chewing his last
prune and saving the stone to suck for
breakfast ought to touch even the heart
of Chifley or Dedman.
The end—for the time being—of the
Victorian metal strike brought sighs and
murmurs of delight from city folk and
worried politicians. Wheatgrowers are
saving their cheers for November and
December when they’ll have to go to the
harvest with old machines and short of
spare parts. Most of Adstralia’s farm
and harvest machinery is made in Vic-
toria and it’ll probably take two years
to pick up the production lost in the
strike. If Pollard, the Federal Minis-
ter for making wheat agreements with
N.Z. and other things, is aware of this
he’s kept it a dark secret.
Johnson, the Minister whose business
it is, told old Brig. Rankin last week
that of 269,811 queries sent to electors
who didn’t vote last September, 116,876
came back undelivered. Of the 144,947
replies, 141,859 gave valid reasons for not
voting. The official story is that the rolls
are as “pure” as can be expected.
Coal, which mysteriously disappeared
from the public eye in the week or so
before the N.S.W, election, was back with
a rush as soon as the voting was over.
It came out that nearly half a million
tons had been lost through strikes in the
past two months and that on one day of
last week the loss was 14,500 tons. This
while the Miners’ Federation bosses were
arguing for three weeks’ annual holidays,
plus May Day (now paid for) and the
rest.
“Russia Is Always Right” Mountjoy
took up his alleged C.S.I.R. duties on
November 20. To February 28 he drew
£136 2s. 3d, in salary and to February 6
£4B Is. Bd. in travelling allowances. To
March 6 he travelled seven times from
Perth to Melbourne, return fares costing
£273 145.; he also put in for a single fare
from Melbourne to Canberra, £4 17s. 9d.,
and a return fare from Melbourne to
Sydney, £ll Is. What a thing it is to
enjoy “Labor’s” favor!
Chifley can be as specious as anybody
when he likes. Asked to consider tax-
relief for authors he admitted that it had
been done in Britain by spreading
royalties over three years, and then got
this off:
In Australia the chief difficulty is whether
special treatment of authors and artists
could be justified without extending the
practice to other taxpayers who receive
abnormal incomes in one year.
The same “difficulty” applied in Britain,
but it was overcome.
Playford, whose S.A. Housing Trust
has done wonders compared with the
grandiose departments and babbling
Ministers east of him, has had to com-
plain of the dearth of bricks, galvanised
iron, flooring timber, cement, sanitary
fittings and asbestos sheets. The iron,
coming from N. S. Wales, is 1(K)0 tons
behind schedule; the hardwood, trom
W.A., is held up by rail congestion. What s
wrong with brickmaking Playford means
to find out, and as for flooring timber
We have failed badly in securing Baltic
supplies, largely, I believe, because of the
unreasonable tariff on timber imports. I
have never been able to understand why
these heavy duties have been placed on
timber when they increase the cost of a
house by £35.
Judging by comparative construction
costs, the increase is much more than
£35 a house in N. S. Wales.
Claiming with truth that N.S.W. north
of Newcastle voted solidly against the
McGirrs, and that the area contains a
population greater than that of W.A.,
Earle Page wants it to see about
making a new State out of itself. It
should have been done —-and in the U.S.A.
would have been done —long ago. And
the far-north-west right out to Tiboo-
burra would assuredly want to come in.
Caucus at Canberra is flying a kite on
a salary increase to £l5OO. A second
proposal is to lift the number of mem-
bers to 96 in the House and 48 in the
Senate. Eight Senators from Tasmania
and none from New England or the
Riverina!
Ever since Calwell’s British builders
arrived! in Canberra there have been
mutterings of disappointment and dis-
content. On Friday they broke out into a
march by over 300 British and Australian
workers upon Federal Parliament to
demand better food and fewer restrictions
on use of gear in the “camps” at East-
lake and Riverside. Lemmon, the Minis-
ter for Works and Housing, hurriedly
agreed to meet a deputation and managed
to get the men off the premises with pro-
mises. “Labor” can’t even look after
its own.
A Bulletin man came down from
Kempsey to Sydney at the week-end,
admiring the verdant grasses and the
happy kine standing knee-deep in them
all the 300-odd miles. Inspired, he left
the train in Sydney and went to a milk
bar for a glass of milk, only to be told
that none was available —the stuff was
rationed!
“Literature” and other matters:
Earle Page has had the experience, unpre-
cedented for a man who has been the King’s
First Minister, of being accused in his absence
of “scandalous character assassination” —this
by Haylen, who scraped back somehow in
Parkes, the subdivisions of which have since
polled substantial majorities against “Labor,”
and who wants a “national theatre,” preferably
as a war memorial, so that his plays may be
produced at the taxpayers’ cost. When the
veteran tried to reply he was denied a hearing
by one voice—Ward’s. A contemptible ex-
pedient which brought an effective reprisal
against one of Ward’s colleagues who wanted
to make “a statement,” and the doctor got
in what he wanted to say at a later sitting.
He knows too much to be euchred by Wards
and Haylens.
What he wanted to say concerned Haylen’s
protege, the former boss Communist propa-
gandist Rawling, who is to get £4OO from the
Commonwealth Literary Fund for writing a
biography of the poet Harpur. The doctor
said he himself had an interest in Harpur, and
had had the Mitchell Library indices examined
without finding a single Rawling article or
paragraph about the poet, although volumes of
Rawling’s Communist stuff were indexed. In
fact, there was not a shred of evidence to
show why Rawling, unknown in the literary
world save for his Communist, writings, should
have been given preference over accepted
authorities who have never been Communists
for £4OO of the taxpayers’ money.
Cameron came in with a demand for an open
inquiry into the operations of the committee
that recommends these subsidies, and asked why
a Communist writing woman had, in 1943,
been given £l5O to go to defence areas in
N. Queensland closed against Commonwealth
members themselves. “And two vile books
she wrote were banned,” Rankin interposed.
A Haylen tirade was interrupted by the
Speaker when the accidental member yelped
“It is sad to see Australian literature
being dragged through the cowyard of the
Country party.” Some feeble special pleading
by Evatt and Chifley sophistries were other
features of the debate. Scullin spoke in a
different strain without touching the main issue,
of which more is going to be heard before this
Parliament is much older.


THAT MORNING-AFTER FEELING.
“Shure, it was a great night we had, Mrs. Hanlon.”
“Indade it was, Mrs. McGirr; but, still and all, we wouldn’t want to be going to another.”


Society
AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS
“Bo”: The resurgence of the theatre
has reached Sydney’s outer suburbs, and
enthusiastic groups are putting on every-
thing from modest one-acters to Shaw
and Maeterlinck. To these horrors of
peace, with their giggling, self-conscious
flappers and stammering young men
whose hands become enormous liabilities
after the first panic-stricken glance at
the audience, the unwilling pa with a
daughter who aspires to be a Bernhardt
is dragged, cursing, though silently.
These unfortunates can be picked in-
stantly by the furtive glances they give
from time to time towards the exit doors
In some halls where the lights are nc
dimmed throughout the proceedings an
odd sufferer will defy convention by
reading his strategically-folded evening
paper, held between his knees. And oc-
casionally one of these compulsory
listeners will be stung to mild retaliation,
as occurred on a recent night. The stage
detective, in an awful school-recitation
voice, had just exclaimed: “Well, that
proves my theory sound. I can now act! ”
It came in a whisper that could be heard
all over the hall —“That’s what he
thinks!”

“Squizz”; One bright spot in strike-
smitten Melbourne was the spectacle of
the dailies coming out as four-pagers, I
found the change refreshing. For the
first time in years my favorite sheet gave
me a well-balanced and digestible review
of the world’s news. First things, for
once, came first and racetrack and film
gossip went by the board. A few months
ago a London journalist told me Aus-
tralian dailies were for the most part
padded with “dogsbody doings.” I
wasn’t quite sure what he meant at the
time. After reading and appreciating my
four-pager 1 now know.

“Caballer”: Billy Hughes was right
about the Australian hats (B. 30/4/’47).
My crowd relieved the British 34th Divi-
sion at Bois Grenier in April, 1916, and
neither we nor the Northumberland
Fusiliers wore battle bowlers. They came
later, and were at first issued as trench
stores and handed over to the relieving
troops. The first helmet was a heavy
affair with a shiny green surface that
had to be covered with hessian to make
it less conspicuous. Later a lighter pat-
tern with a khaki surface came into use.
It blended with the sandbag parapet and
only required whitewashing when the
snow arrived. Even the German,
methodical as he was, never seemed to
enforce the wearing of steel helmets.
Fritz wore a close-fitting neck-covering
helmet, a flat peakless cap or the spiked
helmet beloved by the Hun since 1870.
Occasionally in the early days of
Pozieres a Digger would put on a Fritzy
helmet, but his passion for this form of
amusement waned after a stream of
bullets and a few Mills bombs reminded
him that it was unhealthy to stroll about
newly-captured trenches wearing enemy
equipment.
“Minto”: Reference to “Blue Bird of
Happiness” (B. 23/4/’47) prompts me to
ask the reason for the reverence which
most women seem to have for the name
of John Charles Thomas, now here to
sing to worshippers direct. The other
night J.C, was coming over my
radio at full strength and ! happened to
remark to the ladies of the house “Oh,
there’s Charlie Thomas again.” For a
space no one answered, then my aunt said
reprovingly “You mean John Charles
Thomas.” The other feminine members
of the household nodded approval of the
rebuke.
* * * *
“Ranilam”: About that good time
that Mr. Chifley implies Allied prisoners
had at the hands of the Jerries. One
night during the bitterly cold winter of
1944-45 I watched two British airmen
kill a cat that wandered into our Stalag
at Muhlberg-on-Elbe in Saxony. A few
hours later they boiled and ate it. In
common with the rest of the lads in the
barrack, I was having such a bully time
of it that my reactions were (a) envy at
what looked and smelt like a good feed
and ( b ) annoyance at not having beaten
the two lads to it. Yes, those were grand
days. And those holiday camps that the
Germans ran in Austria for the benefit
of our boys—they were magnificent.
The snow, thfe scenery, the bracing air!
A cobber of mine who was captured at
“Rescue the wife — I've saved all I could.”
Greece in April, 1941, spent four years
in one of them—cracking stones in a
quarry from dawn till dark.

“R. Volt”: Reported by Commander
C. G. Little, of the Australian survey
ship Lachlan, that two chasms have been
found on the seabed 40 miles south of
Kangaroo Island and 130 miles from the
present mouth of the Murray which »may
prove to be the prehistoric channel of
that mighty river. One chasm is two
miles' wide and the other six miles and
4350 feet deep. Similar chasms exist in
other oceans, and are a headache to sub-
marine cable-layers, as there is no way of
relieving the strain on a cable if it has to
span them except by paying out sufficient
slack for the heavy wire to reach the
bottom. When Alfred Russel Wallace
visited the Am Islands to the north of
Australia he was puzzled by the deep
channels cut right across the group from
one coast to the other. They are almost
as symmetrical as canals in Holland, and
as the group is as flat as the Nullarbor
Plain there was no local explanation for
them except the native one that they had
been dug by giants. Wallace’s daring
mind soon had an explanation for them.
He reasoned that they were the original
beds of the huge New Guinea rivers, and
dated from an age when there was a land
bridge between Australia and Asia. The
present mouths of these rivers are in
some cases 300 miles distant from the
Arus. A prehistoric bridge between
southern Australia and the Antarctic
opens up interesting avenues of specula-
tion.

“Col M.”: In the days when radio
sets would not function properly without
an' aerial, I invented a “cutter-offer.”
It was a button attached to the aerial
wire and hidden under the carpet. With
pressure on it with my foot extended
from the armchair, it would turn the
announcer’s blah into welcome nothing-
ness, I had the time for unwelcome ads,
well taped and could usually be sure
of hearing a programme solely of music.
It’s a pity modern radio, groaning with
the weight of even more yap, will not
respond to the same treatment. But even
with the fearful “singing commercials”
which now assail us, we are lucky beside
the inhabitants of a Mexican city. They
possess a station whose function, 24 hours
a day, is to give the correct time once
every minute, while short advertisements
fill in the remainder of the eternal broad-
cast.

“Bramley”: On a hush-hush visit
Warspite anchored off Aldinga Bay (S.A.)
to pick up a British Admiral. The old
boy left Port Adelaide in a launch
operated by the Volunteer Patrol.
In true naval style the launch challenged
Warspite, and while awaiting the reply
paid regard to the regulations by train-
ing her twin machine-guns on the yet un-
verified ship. Warspite also observed the
rules while being challenged by directing
her main armament on the launch. The
picture of machine-guns versus the gun-
tucrets of a battleship was an amusing
repetition of David and Goliath.

“Melbn”: I see that the three platy-
puses which David Fleay, of the Heales-
ville Sanctuary, took to New York de-
lighted a couple of thousand press photo-
graphers by their complete absence of
self-consciousness when they were
dumped into the swimming pool at their
new home. It seems to be a characteristic
of the quaint little creatufes. During this
year’s Swim-through-Melbourne there
was a sudden cessation of the roars of
excitement from the onlookers on the
banks as the leaders approached the
finishing line. A couple of Ornithorhyn-
chus anatinus had taken it into their
heads to give a charming display of
ducking and diving. Having done their
stuff to the audience’s satisfaction they
took a final dive and allowed attention
to return to the race.

“Laetitia”: In the Army I met a type
of tooth carpenter different from
“Milo’s” (B, 23/4/’47). With a pert
A.W.A.S. lass in the chair. Captain Fangs
delayed his start, to turn anxiously
through the pages of an army journal be-
fore exclaiming disgustedly: “Hey!
orderly, ring up headquarters D.D.M.S.
and tell ’em I’m stumped. The informa-
tion in this book says it is to be con-
tinued next issue.” To the startled girl
he explained apologetically. “I’m new at
this job. But hang on for a while till
they tell me over the ’phone how to get
on with it. Don’t worry— we’ll manage
all right.” But by this time the lass had
bolted.

“F.M.C.”: A week before Anzac Day
Renmark (S.A.) celebrated the 50th
anniversary of its community-owned
hotel. The thriving river town has pur-
sued to astonishingly successful effect the
effort described many years ago by The
Bulletin as one of “drinking itself into
a state of beauty and prosperity.” The
hotel itself is now a magnificent three-
storeyed building and will soon be ex-
tended again ; it stands in a setting of
bowling grfeens and river-bank gardens;
and, the critics say, it is beginning to
cater for tourists to the neglect of local
dining custom. But there is no doubt
about the success of the experiment, or
of the force of its example which has
spread to Barmera, Loxton and Nuri-
ootpa. Renmark hotel has in the 50 years,
fat and lean, distributed some £120,000
of its profits about the community—to
hospital, town gardens, showground, in-
stitute, R.S.L. and many other local
bodies. It is today one of the fairest
towns in Australia and swarming with
children. But it does not always re-
member that the credit for its hotel ex-
periment belongs chiefly to one man —the
late Christopher James Ashwell, who
came from New Zealand and was editor
in the ’nineties of the Renmark “Pioneer,”
He it was who insisted on the community
hotel petition in the face of a waning
enthusiasm among his ffellow-committee-
men in certain critical days, and carried
his point. Before then Renmark, with
some 600 or 700 inhabitants, was de-
graded in the sheltering of 13 sly-grog
shops. Incidentally they discovered by
accident only a couple of years ago an
irregularity in the licence held by the
community hotel, and a special Act of
Parliament was necessary to legitimise
some 48 years of its sale of liquor.

“Orion”: A hardy little place is Gun-
bar, at the north-eastern edge of the plain
between Hay and West Wyalong (N.S.W.).
Camped there in a utility truck a few
nights ago and calculated that it consisted
of three houses, one derelict and one a
combined post office, store, petrol station
and farmstead, one church and one hall.
Population—one elderly man, two ex-
servicemen and a boy. A girl had re-
cently left to be married, and one of the
soldiers expects to wed shortly and thus
restore a female citizen to the numbers.
He and his brother are training a colt
which they believe will win the Sydney
Cup. I may have understated the popu-
lation of Gunbar, for as I left I saw
smoke appearing from a chimney in the
third house —though I suspect it was made
by the old fellow, George. I have since
seen a road-guide which gives the
district figure as 258. As one of the
young fellows was helping me repair a
puncture, I said to him “Is this the whole
of Gunbar?” “You see the lot,” he
replied. “Must be an exciting place,” I
suggested. “Well,” he saiti, “the pub was
burned down a little while ago and that
was the stone end o'f Gunbar.”

“Dime”: I was examining some Doul-
ton plates, with a saleswoman dogging
my footsteps. They were adorned with
pictures of Shakspearean characters. My
pursuer was bubbling over with informa-
tion as she glanced at each one to get the
name. “Now, here’s a beauty —it’s Rosa-
lind! And here’s Hamlet, too! Now
what’s this one? Shylock—oh, yes, of
course, Shylock Holmes!”
* * * *
“Anthos”; I don’t remember whether
Victoria overlooked the centenary of
Baron von Mueller (B. 16/4/’47), because
it occurred 22 years ago. “Melbn” is
confusing it with the centenary of the
Melbourne Botanic Gardens, and that
was marked by the publication of a book
telling the story of the gardens and show-
ing by photographs some of its wonder-
ful vistas and trees. The book was edited
by Crosbie Morrison and published by
the Maud Gibson Gardens Trust. Von
Mueller was not bom in Denmark, though
he was of Danish parentage. Rostock,
in Germany, was his native city.
“Melbn” falls into the common error of
believing that the garden’s are a monu-
ment to Von Mueller. Had he limited
his praise to the old chap’s work for the
National Herbarium he would have been
on surer ground. As Government
Botanist Von Mueller was a suc-
cess ; as director of the gardens,
a failure. Morrison says that his
appointment to the latter position was
“followed by a period of 16 years as
sterile in the development of the gar-
dens as a public resort as it was fruitful
in scientific botanical investigation.” He
was removed from that office and a her-
barium was built for him just outside the
main entrance. The old Baron was so
angry that he declared he would never
enter the gardens again, and he kept his
vow, though he toiled in the herbarium
for another 23 years. The gardens are
a monument to Guilfoyle and his suc-
cessors.
* * * *
“Ceg”: Back in 1915 some Diggers
from Broadmeadows Camp were having
a farewell party at a Melbourne cafe
and, like “Cathay” (B, 23/4/’47), they
were souvenir-minded. First a small
“silver” cream jug and then the matching
sugar basin found their way into the
capacious pockets of the military tunics,
then the coffee-pot followed. Back in
camp the articles were stowed away in kit
bags and the next move was to the troop-
ship Afric at Port Melbourne. On the
voyage to Egypt good use was made of
the coffee set and then came Heliopolis.
Funds were low, so the souvenired set
had to be sacrificed'. The canteen was
run by a Syrian from Palestine and the
matter was mentioned to him; 300
piastres changed hands and so did the set.
Some months later I was invited to
supper at the Syrian’s house. Occupy-
ing pride of place on his sideboard was
the famous coffee set with the name
Cafe Francatelli still boldly showing on
each piece.
A GOOD COOK.
' “Young’ lady, 30, good cook, wishes meet honest
man.” —View Mat. ad. in ‘‘S.M.H.”
Straight to the point! How seldom ’tis, if ever,
These modest mating-calls from maid to man
Convey a hint the applicant is clever
With grid and casserole, with pot and pan,
And guarantee she’ll do her best endeavor
Towards providing appetising scran
To meet the needs of any honest lad
Who finds allurement in the artless ad.
\
Most candidates for conjugal connections
Concern themselves with listing how they look,
Descant upon their figures and complexions,
Wherewith bait the matrimonial hook
And satisfy some unknown’s predilections.
She merely claims ability to cook
Loyally and well —a rarer gift maybe
Towards ensuring wedded harmony.
One seems to glimpse her, never rushed or hasty,
But calmly purposeful and deft and spry,
Compounding something eminently tasty
To charm alike the palate and the eye,
A savory omelet or a Cornish pasty
Or, better still, a steak-and-kidney pie,
Some choice comestible, it’s safe to state,
No pin-up girl could hope to emulate.
She has, one likes to think, a light and fairy
Touch for a scone, a pancake or a tart.
And seeing there are ways that widely vary
For those that seek approaches to the heart,
Perhaps what’s sometimes called the “little
Mary”
Is worth consideration for a start,
A bid for some potential Mr. Right
Who’s gifted with a healthy appetite.
These catalogues of charms, mature or dewy,
Talents and tastes refined and modes genteel,
And all the usual husband-hunting hooey
Are apt, I sometimes think, to make you feel
A trifle tired. But here you have a “newy”
Whose simple brevity should hold appeal,
That of a spinster who’s content to tell
Prospective suitors she can cook —and well.

‘Seven Up”: Australians will bet on
anything, all right. The fifth fairway
and sixth tee of our Sydney suburban
golf course are flanked by one of those
Housing Commission “projects,” Every
Saturday before hitting off we have a
bob in; the man who draws a “project’
in which any change is apparent since
the previous Saturday collects. I won 11
bob when my skeleton showed two new
tiles on the roof, apparently the result
of a week’s cogitation by the Commission
and work by- the —er —constructionists.

“M 8”: Wild duck in the United States
appear to be much more easily scared
than do our own waterfowl if an aero-
plane flying over marshes scared them
all away “for six weeks” (B. 7/5/’47).
The ponds and swamps at Eastlakes
(Sydney) abound with waterfowl of all
kinds, which display no interest in the
’planes coming and going to a near-by
aerodrome. Outback I’ve watched both
water and land birds when planes have
been about and they exhibited no concern.
Even the domestic rooster, who always
sounds an alarm when a hawk or a crow
appears, doesn’t give the booming mech-
anical bird a second look. The only
animal I ever saw scared by a plane was
an old grey mare drawing a load of wood.
But then, the plane, with a killed engine,
swooped silently between her ears as she
plodded dreamily along the road.

“8.H.L.”: The unusually large wave
which struck the steamer Wahine in the
Tasman* Sea recalls a somewhat similar
happening to the Bass Strait ferry Nair-
ana a few years ago. The Nairana was
approaching Port Phillip Heads when a
huge wave rose suddenly, out of a calm
sea and broke over the vessel’s starboard
quarter, throwing her almost on her beam
ends; the water reached to the boat deck
for a brief interval. Three persons were
swept overboard and drowned, and a
fourth was dashed against a porthole and
killed. The cause of this wave was
“When the bride said ‘Kiss me, George , I thought she meant ME!”
obscure, but contributing factors were
thought to be a strong ebb tide meeting
a south-west swell at a point where the
water shallowed suddenly owing to the
shelving of the sea bed.

“Hist”:' Misprints, is it? Sometimes
they reveal the mind of the writer more
frankly than he intended. Replying in
his column to a reader’s question
“Should the radio licence fee be in-
creased?” Professor Murdoch said:
“R a di° is changing the character of
civilisation. It is mouldering the mind,
and so shaping the destiny, of the younger
generation.” Or was it a misprint?

“Percy Pawnticket”: Those women
public-’phone hogs (B. 30/4/’47) are not
easily abashed; far from it. I was one
of a growing crowd which formed out-
side a lonely single-’phone booth much
in use while a fat female gurgled over
the wire about trivialities. A man, evi-
dently her male attachment, squirmed
outside f while the waiters made their
comments, and when she emerged, with
all the satisfaction of one who has got
an extraordinarily good money’s worth,
he burst into a nervous reproach about
“keeping all these people waiting.” - She
surveyed them with a lofty scorn. “I
daresay they only want to discuss some
business,” she remarked disdainfully.

“Philat”: Mutilators of postage stamps
(B. 30/4/’47)? My grouch is not against
them, but against the blokes that pinch
the stamps. When Wewak was captured
in 1945 I came across a couple of unused
Japanese stamps. Thinking it would be
a philatelic novelty to have an Australian
Army Field postmark on a Jap stamp, I
stuck the two red portraits of the Mikado,
together with one of George VI, on an
envelope addressed to my wife. The
postal orderly stamped them lightly but
legibly and sent them on their journey,
but somewhere between there and home
a light-fingered gent lifted one off—and
it was the one with the important part
of the postmark on it.

“Frank Mauri”: The Selangor Club,
Malaya, was the last word in posh
exclusiveness, the meeting place of
wealthy planters and mining engineers.
With the advent of British troops mem-
bership was extended to the officers, but
not o.rs. So one of these officers was
1 incensed when he saw a private enter
the sacred precincts. “Get out, my man,”
he bellowed. “Don’t you know that only
civilians and officers are allowed here?”
The intruder smiled. “Pardon me, but
I am the vice-president of the club. 1
have just come from a parade of the
Malayan Volunteers.”

“Minto”: Service weather forecasts
(B. 16/4/’47)? Flying regularly between
New Guinea and Brisbane during 1943-44
our crew made a practice of consulting
both R.A.A.F. and Yank met. stations
before take-off from Moresby. When the
Yanks forecast wind s.-e. 30 knots the
R.A.A.F. gave it as n.-w. 20 knots.
Whenever the R.A.A.F. advised flying at
2000 the Yanks recommended 3000. We
figured there must be some merit in both
systems, so we used to average the two
forecasts and fly accordingly. On that
system I flew 2000 hours over the route.

“Lao-dah”: Plastic surgeons are doing
a roaring trade in Shanghai, where men
and women are having their countenances
remoulded on the age-old assumption of
the fortune-tellers that the shape of ears,
eyes, mouths and noses has a direct bear-
ing on a person’s fortune. In a country
where the frightful torture of footbind-
ing has only recently been completely
abolished this is not surprising. The
Western notion that the compressing of
female feet was a symbol for the seclu-
sion and subjection of the sex is quite
wrong. The custom was sexual in origin
and was no more extraordinary and pos-
sibly less damaging to the health than
the Early Victorian custom of tight-
lacing, the correct procedure for which
was thus described by a leading English
fashion journal: “When lacing the new
stays, the young lady should lie face
downwards on her bedroom floor, and
her mother should place her foot in the
small of her daughter’s back in order to
obtain good purchase. There should be
then no difficulty in making the stays
meet.” No reputable suitor ever paid
court to a young lady in those days un-
less she had an hourglass figure and a
habit of fainting, which symbolised deli-
cacy and refinement. Similarly, no
“ Isn't it about time we had a dividend from that beauty treatment, dear?”
Chinese damsel could curry favor with
the young men unless she had “golden
lilies,” a gait as if she was walking on
eggs and the appearance of being about
to fall over.

“Beta”; Sent from a country camp to
the Showground a mate of mine worked
for over a year as a clerk before applying
to D.R.O. for a transfer. The D.R.O.
man who checked his papers came to the
desk. “Sorry, Dig,” he said, “we can’t
take any more sergeants, only privates.”
“But,” expostulated the applicant, “I’m
only a private.” “Cut it out,” warned the
n.c.o. “You’re a sergeant. Your pro-
motion went through orders,” and he
gave the date. The young bloke wouldn’t
believe it. I wouldn’t either, until he
showed me his pay book with over £lOO
pounds back pay credited. He still
doesh’t know why. The only possible
explanation seems to be that, at the time
he left the country unit, someone of the
same name was recommended for pro-
motion, and that inadvertently the all-
important regimental numbers got mixed.

“Penola”: Down in the Tantanoola
tiger country of S.A. they’re wonder-
ing what happened to a church at
Kongorong. A stone edifice, built about
20 years ago by parish effort, it silently
fell in upon itself one evening and be-
came a heap of rubble, with wreckage
scattered many yards, only the porch re-
maining. Theories range from, a Divine
visitation to a brief and extremely local-
ised earth tremor. The usual police in-
quiries are being made, and so far nobody
has been found who heard or saw any-
thing that might suggest the cause. Still,
it’s funny country down there. There was
an unfillable hole in Mt, Gambier which
was popularly supposed to lead out into
the ocean, and weird noises are sometimes
heard from underground on still nights.
An old mate with whom I once battled
the S.A. south-east has never forgotten
the place. “I see where a church dis-
appeared down there,” I said. “Wouldn’t
be surprised,” he came back. “I’ve lost
things down there meself.”

“Macnell”: Shropshire was generally
accepted by the Americans as the most
efficient radar ship in the Pacific. Dur-
ing a bombardment of Leyte Gulf, Aus-
tralia damaged and Chicago tor-
pedoed—were ordered out. Shropshire’s
warning ) radar set picked up miles
away a large group of enemy planes
whose course seemed to be heading them
directly for the crippled cruisers, now
steaming slowly away from the western
tip of Leyte. Shropshire was the only
ship who hacj detected them. An urgent
order was sent to the fighter-direction
destroyer further down-coast, telling her
to dispatch a flight of Lightnings to
meet the threat. The Lightnings were
pulled out from their sector over the land
and deployed at top speed. Still no
other ship could range on the enemy
group, so Shropshire, heavily engaged as
she was, directed the rescuing fighters
herself. Then, with almost omniscient
exactitude, the youngster operating her
set reported the enemy flown into a rain-
squall ; the Lightning leader reported a
rain-squall dead ahead. “Patrol in figure
eight formation south of squall,” he was
ordered This the fighters did, with the
Jap hopping in and out of its protection
each time he saw what was waiting for
him. In the end the bombers gave it up
and headed northward back to base, with
the twin-tailers in hot pursuit. Australia
and Chicago moved on to safety. Shrop-
shire received a letter from Washington
praising her efficiency.

“Mullum”: Until recently I was a firm
believer in mechanisation. Now I am
not so sure. A couple of young men
canvassed our suburb offering to mow
the lawn each week for two bob. They
arrived with a motor lawn-mower and
did in 20 minutes a job which used to
take me all Saturday afternoon. Why do
I object? Well, when I pushed the lawn-
mower, Mrs. Mullum used to clip the
edges. Now I have to do that myself, and
if I had my choice, I would select
mower-pushing any day.

“Serjeant Buzfuz” on libel actions:
The risks to which fiction writers and the
papers that publish their work are exposed were
once more exemplified in a Sydney court fast
week when a bookmaker, Samuel Peters, got a
verdict for £6so—he had sued for £lO,OO0 —
against Melbourne “Sporting Globe” for libel
contained in a short story. The yarn concerned
“a bookie named Sammy Peters,” who em-
ployed a safe-cracker and subsequently double-
crossed him. The real-life Peters claimed that
as a result of reading the story some of his
friends had doubted his integrity and one
had ceased playing golf with him and stopped
visiting his home. He particularly objected to
a reference to “fleecing of the suckers.” De-
fence was that the author was unaware of the
existence of Peters, that the yam was a work
of imagination and that the similarity of names
was purely an accident.
The case emphasises the warning of Lord
Mansfield, “Whatever a mail publishes he pub-
lishes at his peril,” and it recalls the famous
Artemus Jones case. An English paper, in .a
skit on “the season” in the south of France,
referred to one Artemus Jones, a barrister,
who was alleged to be enjoying the sunshine
of the Riviera and the company of a tart.
Unfortunately for the newspaper there war an
Artemus Jones and he was a barrister. He
didn’t take kindly to having his name linked
with philandering, and he filed a writ for libel.
Although neither the author of the article nor
the editor knew him, be had at one time
actually been on the staff of the paper, and
had had signed articles in it. Five of his wit-
nesses stated they had read the offending article
and had thought it referred to him. Verdict,
£1750 damages. In his direction to the jury
Channell, J., said that if they thought reason-
able persons who knew of the existence of the
plaintiff would think it referred to him, they
ought to find for the plaintiff; it was immaterial
whether the article was intended to refer to
the plaintiff or not.
Artemus Jones was no “piker,” as they say
on the other side of the Pacific. In process
of years he received a knighthood and a judge-
ship.

“Plop”: American subway companies
are giving hope to tired ladies who have
to stand and hate while travelling. New
York women have been getting increas-
ingly peeved at the “ghastly things” which
the harsh lighting, used in the trains,
does to their make-up. The companies,
in accordant sympathy, plan to instal a
new type of lighting which, shedding a
“warm, white,' flattering, soft light,” is
guaranteed to get any lass with a reason-
able dial a seat.

“Missing”: During the traffic hold-up
in Melbourne a suburban postmaster re-
ceived a ring from head office to inform
him that a telegraph messenger, unable
to reach his usual office, would be report-
ing there for duty. Three days later he
turned up. “Where have you been all
this time?” inquired the postmaster.
“Well, sir,” replied the messenger, “it’s
like this. When I left home to report
here, I wasn’t sure of the locality so I
asked the tram conductor where the post
office was. He said that there was one
at the next corner. I got off and reported
there, and it wasn’t till last night I found
I was working at the wrong place.”
THE RUSH FOR THE SPOIL.
When the tumult and shouting have ended,
And the shots for political goals,
And all the chin-mUsic expended
In efforts at heading the polls,
There’s another pitched battle to waken
Fresh issues for strife and turmoil,
Once “Labor” is home with the bacon—
The rush for the spoil.
With shoulder to shoulder like brothers
They stood till the upshot was known.
Now some are found claiming what others
As hotly insist is their own.
The plum-tree is theirs for the shaking,
But bitter discordancy comes
When the question is who should be taking
First whack at the plums.
What plotting and planning and leaguing
Of section ’gainst section is found,
What subtle and furtive intriguing
Goes on, you may guess, underground,
When office, with all of the glamor
And bunco and prestige it denotes,
Depends on the tap of the hammer —
The bids being in votes!
They’re fighters of vigor and stress in
All scraps, and you’ll note that it goes
When the combat becomes internecine
And friends are translated to foes.
Their trust one another they fix in,
For the downtrodden masses they toil,
But it’s each for himself when they mix in
The rush for the spoil.

THE SERVICE MAN
Defence and Strategy.
Ek Dum”: What are the minimum
needs in organisation for Australian
defence?
They are greater than they have ever
been before in terms of manpower, be-
cause the only nations likely to make war
on us are those which have unlimited
numbers of men available, at their abso-
lute call under a system of conscription
more despotic than that of Hitler and
already organised and toughened in
battle.
Let it be said also that if war should
come, it is likely to begin east of Suez,
at the point nearest the points of con-
centration of the U.S.S.R. or Far Eastern
Powers, most favorable for the subjuga-
tion of India and for the cutting of
Imperial trade routes. It is not likely to be
basically a naval war on a large scale.
Australia’s attack would come rather from
the air. It is not likely to be an atom
“Just something light — I cant go into the Water on a full stomach."
war, at least for very many years to
come.
What is to be feared is transport of
large numbers of men by large numbers
of heavy carriers and gliders —forces
advancing towards the country in stages
10 times longer than those necessary in
the last war or disastrous bombing such
as Japan suffered.
In the alternative there might be no in-
vasion at all until the war had been won
—assuming that an enemy could win—
the outlying limbs of British and Ameri-
can territory being left for attention
after the battle—scenes of “mopping-up
operations.”
Any war which is fought in the future
will be a world war. The attacking may
come in two ways—from outside and
from inside, by Communists. It is being
fought internally and insolently even now.
For example, the Federal Council of the
Painters’ Union and the Building Trades
Federation, both Communist-controlled,
have declared the Cent'ralian rocket-range
“black” —as Mr. Menzies said at the
week-end, to “support Russia’s policy.”
The Fifth Column
The first necessity at the present time
is fbrces sufficient to secure the in-
ternal safety of the country in time of
war ; to see that ships run at the will
of the Government when operations be-
gin and that coal and fuel supplies are
not held up by a Fifth Column.
The second necessity is that the
machinery of self-armament shall be in
existence, well-oiled, capable of taking
advantage of modern inventions and
developments so soon as they are made
available —our own scale of research and
planning makes it unlikely that we our-
selves shall contribute much, except pos-
sibly in invention.
It is essential that there should be
some secrecy from the enemy about these
matters. Since any new war is likely to
be a war between Communists and non-
Communists, it should be illegal for any
employer to employ a Communist in parts
of defence works and certain industries
even in peace-timfe.
It was shown in the Westralian cases
in 1940 that the Communist party, in-
cluding then officials such as the present
“Government” is prepared to employ in
secret defence positions, was in communi-
cation with bodies hostile to the British
Commonwealth in Vienna, an enemy city,
the channel of communication being
Moscow, and was gathering material of
use to the enemy, whatever use was made
of it.
In a war in which Russia was involved
Communists could be expected to carry
on a much more intensive campaign,
especially as they have learnt from
experience that, in easygoing Aus-
tralia, for what would be capital
offences in other countries they may suffer
nothing worse than a three-months sen-
tence imposed by a magistrate. And
on the experience of the last war he may
be the sort of magistrate who remarks
that he is making the sentence light be-
cause the traitor in the dock is a “sin-
cere” traitor and really believes he should
help the enemy,

to which they are vulnerable and which,
if it breaks down, would result m an in-
vaier needing very little manpower for
defence must take the form of
internal air-defence systems and a wide-
flung ring of protection stretching far
outside the continent itself, so planned
and prepared for that it can be manned
instantly.
Internal Defence
Internal defence calls for large num-
bers of highly-trained men and women
already equipped for their jobs when war
breaks out; tot large quantities of intri-
cate technical machinery and radar and
other equipment and the highly-skilled
staffs necessary to it. It calls for
abundant up-to-date aircraft. And it calls
particularly for an organised and
properly maintained system of aero-
dromes designed for modern conditions
and on a scale larger both in individual
units and in aggregate capacity than in
the last war.
It needs a sufficient number of
properly-trained operatives to guard vital
war factories against internal sabotage,
and it needs knowledge of the internal
forces of the enemy sufficient to ensure
that when war comes they will be re-
moved from areas of temptation before
they can do any harm.
The Widening Ring
In regard to external defence the de-
velopments of the last few years have
altered the trends of modern strategy in
a remarkable way. It used to be a theory,
one to which Clausewitz subscribed, and
which many another has successfully
practised, that the most successful way
of fighting an enemy was to roll the re-
sources of the menaced nation into a
ball and fight the attacker at the furthest
possible point from his base and at the
nearest point to its own massed resources.
There the attacked could use his whole
concentration of brawn, muscle and
materials, with least strain upon his own,
and the greatest strain upon the attacker’s,
transport; also, with a complete advan-
tage in communications.
It was an application of this
theory which wrecked German plans at
Alamein. If Montgomery had had to
follow Rommel across North Africa to
fight him the task would have been
harder and the tale might have been
different. British and German chiefs of:
staff knew this. Rommel repudiated the
advice of his men.
Now, however, though in essence the
theory may be the same, the point to
which the enemy may be allowed to
approach without destroying the safety
factor has been flung out by thousands
of miles. Thus defence concentration,
though theoretically it is desirable, is dis-
persed to such an extent that it nullifies
many advantages.
It would be safe to say that in any
world war between major Powers,
modernly equipped, in Europe today the
whole continent would instantly become
a war area, subject to large-scale or com-
paratively large-scale attack at any time
within 48 hours at most. It would be
equally safe to say that the more popu-
lated parts of the east coast of America
and possibly Canada would be open to
eome attack at once and to large-scale
attack within a short time.
The Three Thousand Mile Zone
In Australia an arbitrary danger area
may be set as 3000 miles from the Eastern
defence zones or from any point which
the enemy felt it of advantage to attack.
This means that once there is an active
and immediate menace from Fremantle in
the west, to Singapore in the north, to
New Guinea in the north-east, and from
islands as far east as Tahiti in the Pacific,
Australasia comes directly into the active
war zone. From any of those areas a
modernly-equipped enemy could over-
night—once he was established —destroy
the vital Australian cities and industrial
centres with powerful air forces unless
they were fully and powerfully defended
with local defence. They are relatively
in the position in which London was in
1940.
Thus New Guinea, Fiji, New Zealand,
the Moluccas, Singapore, all cease to be
external defence areas from Australia’s
point of view. They have all become
merged by conquest of problems of time
and distance into Australia’s domestic
defence systems, and Australia must be
prepared to take a permanent share in
their defence.
In fact, Australia should be taking a
very vital interest in their defence now.
From the point of view of Australia’s
safety they are as much part of this
country as Marrickville or any suburb of
Melbourne or Brisbane. Their integra-
tion, the widening of the zone within
which safety lies, puts a strain on our
resources never known before. It makes
impossible the continuance of the kind
of restriction under which defence by
volunteers could be enough under any
circumstances.
It wipes out the possibility that the
country can be defended by a compelled
militia, trained for a few days a year and
able to elect to stay inside the limits of
the continent because “Labor” regards
anything which takes place outside the
three-mile limit (even in New Guinea or
Norfolk Island) as a foreign war.
The Importance of Training
It emphasises the fact that, especially
for a small nation with limited manpower
resources, the first essentials are a high
degree of training in sie maximum pos-
sible numbers and flexibility, which can
only be attained by having ready inten-
sively-organised sources of power and
armaments that will make every human
unit of defence usable to the last ounce
of his or her potential, and with the
greatest mobility and versatility.
This calls for universal training, and
for versatility of training for all.
It calls for the training of the soldier
that he may be adapted to sea warfare
in emergency, the airman to fight on the
ground if he is needed and the ground
man to fight in the air or do a job in
the air if he is required in emergency.
Defence by push button using a small
force commanded by Mr. Chifley is a
hollow dream. It is about as hollow as
the theory that Australia has become one
of the great Powers simply because Dr.
Evatt makes a noise like a great Power.
The only thing which makes a Power
great in this wicked world is its ability
to enforce its greatness through strength
when the test comes. All pretensions to
greatness which depend on voices wilt
if the nation which nurses them cannot
repel an enemy. The difference between
a little dominion in a great Common-
wealth and a big dominion is the differ-
ence between the pear ripe to be plucked
and the firm-rooted tree on which it
grows.
Taxes and Defence.
“Ek Dum”: Mr. Chifley has made
some comparisons, comforting to him-
self, between Australian and British in-
come taxes on the £3OO-£lOOO p.a. groups
to the disadvantage of Britain ; but he did
not say why the disadvantage existed.
One of the reasons lies in defence.
Britain, with 47,000,000 people (includ-
ing Northern Ireland), supports a Royal
Navy of 13 battleships, 13 heavy aircraft-
carriers, 58 cruisers, 215 destroyers and
114 submarines.
Australia, with 7,400,000 people and a
far greater proportion of. adult males,
maintains three cruisers, two of them old
and one without two of her guns, and a
few destroyers. All, save three, were
bought from Britain or received from
the British taxpayers as gifts.
Britain carries the war load of World
War I, the whole load of the develop-
ment of the major war weapons in
World War ll—bombers, fighters, shell-
making machines, tommy-guns, radar,
artillery (including the 25-pounder)—and
the loss of shipping in World War II as
well as World War I. She is carrying
the burdens of half a dozen allies and is
feeding enemies.
And Britain is supporting, at the pre-
sent time, defence forces of 1,000,000 men,
apart from her territorial divisions on a
basis of compulsory service. Australia’s
defence “force,” including clerks and
bottle-washers, approximates 50,000, of
whom 10,000 volunteers are in Japan.
Even the Japan force is raised
with difficulty. Yet Britain is compelled
—for the defence of Australian lines of
communication as well as for her own
defence —to keep at least 150*000 men on
a first-class operational basis between
Ceylon and Gibraltar.
The extent to which the Chifleys are
“poling” on the Old Man is enough to
make any Australian who knows the real
position blush with shame.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Douglas Mawson, who had most to do
with Canberra’s decision to authorise ex-
penditure of £150,000 on preliminary
planning for another Australian expedi-
tion to the Antarctic, is probably too old
to lead it, though at 65 he is still as
vigorous as many men half his age. His
first expedition was in 1903, when he
joined in the geological exploration of
the New Hebrides. Four years later he
was on Shackleton’s staff in the Antarctic,
ascended Mount Erebus and took obser-
vations at the magnetic pole. From 1911
to 1914 he was leading the first Austra-
lasian Antarctic expedition. His last great
feat of exploration was in 1929, when he
commanded the joint British, Australian
and M.L. expedition. His Antarctic ex-
plorations earned him the King’s Polar
Medal and a couple of gongs from the
Royal Geographical Society, as well as
American, French, German and Italian
decorations. Mawson was born at Brad-
ford, Yorkshire, and educated at the uni-
versities of Sydney and Adelaide ; he has
been Professor of Geology and Miner-
alogy in Adelaide since 1920.
J. W. S. Brancker, Eastern Division
Manager for 8.0.A.C., was the first
trainee appointed to Imperial Airways in
1929. He was a regional director in
Bangkok when Thailand threw in the
sponge to the Japs, and he escaped cap-
ture by footing it out of the city as the
Japs came in, and succeeded in reaching
Pitsanlok, where he chartered a ’plane to
the Burmese border and finally reached
Rangoon. He ,is a son of Sefton
Brancker, who was the G.O.C. R.F.C. in
the Middle East during World War One
and was later Director-General of Civil
Aviation in Britain.
One result of the elections in N.S.W.
and Queensland will be a much-needed
infusion of younger blood into both Par-
liaments. In N.S.W. the three new
Liberal city members are all under 40—
P, H. Morton, who took the Mosman
seat from Independent D. P. Macdonald,
is a business manager of 36 who has been
Mayor of Mosman; R. C. Dewley, a
master butcher, who won Drummoyne,
is 33, and the new member for Lane Cove,
solicitor K. M. McCaw, is 39. C. B.
Cutler, the Country-party candidate, who
seems to have the Orange seat in his
grasp, is a Ninth Divvy man, and vice-
president of the Orange R.S.L. He’s the
youngest of the lot, 29. Queensland’s
younger new members include J. Bjelke-
Peterson, a 36-year-old farmer from the
Kingaroy district (he won Nanango for
the Q.P.P.), and D. A. Low, a Country-
party man of th,e same age who was
elected for Cooroora. The youngest
M.L.A. will be Gordon Chalk, who won
the East Toowoomba seat for the Q.P.P.
at 33. Queensland Labor’s only success-
ful entry for Youth in Politics is Frank
Roberts, a 34-year-old barrister, returned
for Nundah.
General Blarney has received from the
hands of Jonkheer De Ranitz, Nether-
lands Charge d’Affaires in Australia, the
Grand Cross of the Order of Orapje-
Nassau, the highest award ever given to
an Australian by the Netherlands Gov-
ernment. It gave expression to “the
thankfulness and admiration of all our
countrymen for all the things that the
Australian Army did during the war.”
Dr. John Dale, 0.8. E., Melbourne’s
tall city health officer, is known for his
unorthodox attitude towards health
matters, and he left fresh matter for the
City Fathers to puzzle over before leav-
ing for England to investigate civic de-
velopments. In a report to the health
committee hei recommended the elimina-
tion of parts of Melbourne’s parklands
and their use as housing estates, while,
in exchange, suitable areas in North Mel-
bourne and Carlton colild be developed
as open spaces. His reason is that these
alleged lungs of the city aren’t lungs at
all but grazing areas for sheep, horses,
footballers, etc. Dr. Dale was born in
Birmingham, was assistant m.o.h. to that
city from 1911 to 1916, served with dis-
tinction in the First World War, where
he collected a Belgian, order and men-
tions in dispatches, and was Perth’s city
health officer for seven years. He is a
persuasive broadcaster.
Appointed Commissioner of Soil Con-
servation in W.A. in succession to L. J.
Teakle, who has gone to Queensland
University to take over the Chair of Agri-
culture there, George Burvill has had a
notable scholastic career. His progress
through the University of W.A., where he
gained his degree of B.Sc. (Agric.), was
littered with prizes and scholarships and
in 1939 Adelaide University conferred a
M.Sc. degree on him for work and pub-
lications on soil research. On the prac-
tical side he has worked on soil surveys
in the Lake Brown, Cleary and Salmon
Gums districts of his own State, and has
done a considerable amount of work for
the C.S.I.R. soils division in Victoria and
S.A. He’s 38.
Passed her 97th milestone in Mel-
bourne, Meta Pelham, claimed, probably
with reason, to be the oldest actress in the
British Empire, She was 83 when she
made her last public appearance on the
closing night of the old Royal in Bourke-
street in 1933 with Gladys Moncrieff. It
was the same playhouse in which she
saw her first play, “The School for Scan-
dal,” in 1855. A list of the people she
played with in a career which covered
everything from Shakspeare to panto and
melodrama reads like an actors’ Who's
Who —Ethel Irving, Lilian Braithwaite,
Nigel Playfair, Herbert Marshall, Barry
Jackson, Marie Lohr and, coming to
Australia, almost everybody from the
Brough-Boucicaults and J. F. Cathcart
to Wybert Reeve, Dan Barry and Fanny
Wiseman. At 78 she got a new lease of
theatrical life with Gregan McMahon,
who cast her in the parts of charming
old ladies like the Mrs. Coade of Barrie’s
“Dear Brutus.” The gracious old lady
numbers amongst her friends most of the
new and old theatrical crowd of Mel-
bourne.
Another addition to the long list of
Scottish engineers who have made good
in Australia is Richard Henry Lea, first
manager of the Government-controlled
Electricity Trust of S.A., which last year
took over the responsibility for Adelaide’s
light and power from the Adelaide Elec-
tric Supply Co, A Glaswegian, Lea
learnt his engineering in this country; he
came here after World War One, in
which he served as a lieutenant in the
British Army. When he arrived in Adel-
aide he went to work as a laborer with
the Electric Supply Co. and studied
engineering at Adelaide ’Varsity. He col-

lected a B.E. degree three years later, and
by 1936 was assistant manager of the
company. During the second war he
joined the A.I.F. and was C.O. of 2/4th
Field Workshops in the Middle East, and
later held a high post with First Aus-
tralian Army. He is president of Adel-
aide Legacy.
Dead in Melbourne at 62, Louis Bussau,
war-time Victorian Agent-General in
London and chairman of the Australian
Wheat Board. Born at Natimuk, he
studied for the law, then took to farm-
ing. Elected M-L.A. for Ouyen in 1932,
he was Attorney-General and Minister
for Transport for three years. His first-
hand knowledge of farming made him a
valuable A.-G. from 1938 to 1942. In
England during the Battle for Britain he
visited every blitzed area at the height
of the conflict. Premier Dunstan re-
called him for expert advice on A.R.P.
measures when Melbourne was preparing
for raids and worse.
“Feng Shui” on a Felton purchase;
One man who had a special interest in the
handing over of Felton Bequest treasures to the
National Gallery in Melbourne was one of the
trustees, Herbert Wade Kent. Born in Melbourne
and educated at Melbourne Grammar, he went as
a young shipping clerk into the service of the
famous old firm of Butterfield and Swire, which
has traded with China since the days of John
Company. He went to China shortly after the
Boxer Rebellion, and was there when the revo-
lution caused swarms of Manchu officials to
discard their official robes and the market was
flooded with priceless examples of ancient
Celestial art of all descriptions. Young Kent
spent his savings in purchasing everything of
value he could lay his hands on. He browsed
around antique markets, got acquainted with
impoverished members of the old regime and
dealers and even haunted ancient graveyards
which the enthusiasts of the new order were
ploughing up for cultivation. He thus acquired
the finest collection of old Ming and Sung
that has ever been brought to Australia. Shortly
after his retirement he made the magnificent
decision to present the whole collection, esti-
mated then to be worth £20,000 and now
worth far more, to the National Gallery of
Victoria. The gallery appointed him Honorary
Curator of its Chinese section, so he not only
kept his treasures, in effect, but got a life’s
occupation which any connoisseur as keen as
he is would delight in. Among the articles
handed over the other day were a fresh lot
of vases and early carvings showing the Greek
influence introduced inadvertently to Asia by
Alexander the Great. Valued at £5OOO, they
were purchased, mainly from refugees from
China in London, by Kent on behalf of the
Felton.
Charles Pratt, retired as an active air-
line captain with A.N.A., must be one of
the oldest active commercial pilots ; he
has 12,000 hours to his credit, and has
trained over 300 pilots in the last 30 years.
He served on Gallipoli and transferred to
the R.F.C. from the Middle East, learned
to fly in the old Maurice Farmans, and
after the war bought four planes with
which he opened a flying school at
Geelong. Later he joined Ray Parer in
New Guinea flying passengers and cargo
to the goldfields.
Brides to we Lavender Estate at Lilydale
(Tasmania), which has just celebrated its

The founder, C. K. Denny, has now taken
his two sons into partnership. Both served
throughout the war, J.O.K. winning the.
Military Cross in Africa, and E.F.K.
gaining the D.FsC. and Bar for outstand-
ing service in the R.A.F. Last lavender

has won through without Government
assistance.
Appointed to carry out research work
in fish culture for the C.5.1.R., Dr. A. G.
Nicholls is a science graduate of the Uni-
versity of W.A. Twenty years ago he
took part in a scientific expedition to the
Barrier Refef, after which he was attached
to marine-research stations at Plymouth
and Millport on the Firth of Clyde.
He also carried out research work in
Canada and U.S.A. before returning to
W.A. to work on marine biology under
a University Fellowship.
E. Evans, who was responsible for one
of the big surprises of the Queensland
election when he defeated Deputy-
Premier Walsh in Mirani, is very well
known in the Queensland sugar industry.
Fifty-five years old, he began in the in-
dustry as a canecutter and for the past
13 years has been chairman of the Far-
leigh sugar mill and the Pioneer Shire
Council.
“Jimsie”: The 75 years of the life of James
William Perry, who recently took his final call
at Beaumaris (Vic.), were spent in the circus
game. No man knew more about sidewalls,
tops, centre pieces, quarter poles, show towns
and sawdust arenas. He was in turn tumbler,
rider, advance agent, horse- and dog-trainer,
bandmaster, ringmaster and owner; his
specialty jockey act was a gem of grace and
ease; and he even did a bit of clowning.
Travelling by road, he toured Maoriland and
all the States except W.A’. He got his train-
ing and knowledge of the show business from
the old Eroni couple, his parents. He took
up jumping horses and jumping dogs and
successfully incorporated them as acts into
the show. The Eroni string of jumpers— it
included Strathmore, Moral and Daylight —
was a top-line publicity unit, but their race-
horses were drongos. After his mother’s death
Jim pulled out of the Eroni outfit and ran
his own show under the name of Perry Bros.
It is still on the road.
At intervals over the past dozen years
stories have appeared in The Bulletin
under the name E. O. Schlunke. Always
they have had a farming background and
always they have borne the hallmark of
sincerity. This is not surprising, for
Schlunke, like most worth-while writers.
FARMER AND AUTHOR.
tells of things whereof he knows. He
was born and has spent most of his life
in the Temora district of N.S.W., where
he farms the land his father farmed be-
fore him. The only long spell he has
had away from those parts was spent at
Hurlstone Agricultural High. There he
won a scholarship in Agricultural Science,
but his hands and shoulders were needed
in the home paddocks so he didn’t follow
it up. Since he began putting wheat and
sheep on paper he has turned out a wad
of short yarns, a couple of newspaper
serials and a novel which is now in the
publisher’s hands. Prior made this sketch
when Schlunke dropped into The Bulle-
tin office.
Judge William Howard Magennis, dead
at 63, as a judge in Melbourne introduced
the curfew. His intention was kindly.
Rather than send delinquents to reforma-
tories or gaols where they were forced
to consort with criminals, he imposed
bonds, one of which was that they should
stay in their own homes after eight in
the evening for a certain period. Most
of the objections came from parents who
couldn’t manage their own children, but
the Judge persisted and got the name of
Curfew Magennis. Born at Dookie (Vic.)
and educated at Scotch College and the
University of Melbourne, he was 11 years
on the County Court Bench. An ardent
huntsman, he followed the hounds and
was master of the exclusive Oaklands
Hunt Club.
Into the silence:
In Brisbane, at 86, W. F. S. Key, for many
years a leading member of the Queensland
Public Service, a keen amateur sportsman, and
reputed the first man to ride a safety bicycle
in Brisbane.
In Brisbane, at 52, Dr. William Joseph
Fletcher Douglas. While an 18-year-old junior
teacher at the Normal School in Brisbane he
enlisted with the A.I.F. in 1914 and saw exten-
sive service oversea, being twice severely
wounded. On returning to Australia he com-
pleted a medical course at Sydney University
and practised in Brisbane from 1925, courage-
ously bearing the effects of the war injuries
which eventually caused his death.
In Adelaide, at 52, Arthur Charles Strempel,
editor of the “Stock and Station Journal” since
1931, vice-president of the Australian-American
Movement, and author of two, booxs of verse.
In Adelaide, at 80, Henry Ernest Giegory,
oldest horse-trainer in SA. His stables pro-
duced many top-notchers, including Wee Gun,
who scored in a Birthday Cup and Adelaide
Cup, and Amalfi, winner of- Port Adelaide
and Australian and Williamstown Cups.
In Melbourne, William Francis Lynch, first
conductor appointed to the Spirit of Progress,
the Victorian Railways’ de-luxe train. He was
special conductor on the train King George
and Queen Elizabeth used in Australia.

Wcmen's letters
From Melbourne
Lovely girls in colorful sarongs, a
tropical island setting on the stage and
shimmering fish suspended from the ceil-
ing amidst large balloons were just a few
of the captivating novelties arranged for
the Coral Sea Ball which was held at the
St. Kilda Town Hall. Miniature palm-
trees, tropical fruit and coconuts adorned
each table. The lovely pieces of coral
which were set on the official tables were
brought down from the Coral Sea by
Mrs. W. Killough, who had been deep-sea
fishing with her husband. Proceeds from
the ball, which was held under the direc-
tion of the Australian-American Associa-
tion, go to the Children’s Hospital. The
Federal president, R. G, Casey, and Mrs.
Casey, whose gown was of black and gold
brocade, received the official guests, who
included the Premier and Mrs, Cain, she
in black gown and silver-fox cape ; Cr.
R. H. Solly, who deputised for the Lord
Mayor, and Mrs. Solly, whose gown of
midnight-blue crepe glittered with rhine-
stone trimming; Mr. and Mrs. Wallace
Mitchell, the latter in a black formal
jacket suit; Brigadier-General Sebree,
U.S. Military Attache, and Mrs. Sebree,
whose white crepe gown had a white net
yoke on which was appliqued leaves of
the crepe outlined in silver sequins.
A trio of dancers who favored white
comprised Mrs. Harold Rabling, Mrs.
E. Benton and Roma Palmer —all three
frocks had varieties of sequin trimming.
Mrs. Sauer, wife of the Asst. U.S. Mili-
tary Attache, was in emerald-green crepe.
Mrs. Ralph Michaelis’s flowing draperies
were of old-gold satin. Vera .Pritchard
was in heavenly-blue crepe with diamante
embellishing the tunic and skirt; Ella
Moscovitz’s everglades-green crepe frock
was made with a low-rounded neck.
At midnight the floor show com-
menced. As Miss Coral Sea Margot Cor-
naga wore a gown of white satin, beauti-
fully draped. Miss Australia, portrayed by
Juanita Fendick wearing a bouffant frock
of white satin, was followed by Martha
Sebree, as Miss America. Her frock
featured a tight-fitting bodice of black
velvet allied to a ballerina skirt of black
chiffon. About her shoulders was a cape
of deep-blue. Then followed girls repre-
senting the islands of the Pacific, and lastly
Bettina Welch as the Red Cross &irl.
Pat Wawn did a grand job as ticket
secretary; there was no confusion at the
tables. Rhoda Taylor worked with
Claude Flemming to produce the show.
M. Pierre Auge, Minister for France,
flew from Canberra to present Madame
Crivelli, wife of Dr. Marcel Crivelli, with
the Cross of the Legion of Honor in
recognition of the work she did during
the First and Second World Wars as
president of the French Red Cross of
Victoria. But Madame is not the first of
her family to receive the high honor ;
her husband, one of her five sons, also
her grandfather, were awarded this deco-
ration. With her usual thoughtfulness,
Lady Dugan sent Madame Crivelli a
large sheaf of red, white and blue flowers,
and at the investiture was represented
by Mrs. A. A. Lord.
At the conclusion of the ceremony, a
reception, to which over 150 guests had
been invited, was given by the French
vice-consul, M. Roger Loubere, the presi-
dent of the French-Australian Associa-
tion, Prof. Maurice Belz, the president
of the Alliance Franfaise, Madame A.
Gay, and the president of the French
Chamber of Commerce in Victoria, M.
G. Caro. As befitted Frenchwomen, hats
were original and striking. Madame
Aslungul wore a high black turban,
swathed to a point in front, with her
black frock and blue fox cape. Madame
H. de Croix, who came with her husband,
the French Consul-General in Sydney,
chose a small black velvet high-cut cloche
hat which was finished with a cluster of
pale-blue and black coque feathers. Mr.
and Mrs. Bowen Pain were present to
congratulate Madame Crivelli ; Mrs..
Pain chose a small beige tulle hat with
her short brown ermine coat and brown
frock. The Robinson lady was attractive
in a black suit with a white frilly blouse,
her small black hat having green coque
feathers set at each side. Among others
noted were M. and Madame Modesti,
Madame W. Cockerton, Mile. Lilliane
Gay and Lieut, and Mme. Goque with
their small son and daughter.
The news that Brigadier Edmund
Sebree, his wife and daughters Martha
and Pauline, are leaving Melbourne has
been greeted with general dismay. The
brigadier goes home to the U.S.A., where
he will take up a new post in the Intelli-
gence Division. Brigadier Sebree first
came to Melbourne in 1942 as leader
of the first American Task Force, arriv-
ing here with 20,000 troops on the night
Darwin was bombed. Since March,
1946, he has been in Melbourne as U.S.
Military Attache. He and his family have
been immensely popular.
Photographer John Duncan has here
captured the personality of Margaret
Butler Crisp, who has just announced her
engagement to Captain Bruce Cornish,
A.I.F. Margaret is the only daughter of
Mrs. H. J. Crisp, St. Kilda-road, and the
late Thomas E. Crisp, Royal Park. Edu-
cated at St. Catherine’s, Toorak, Margaret
did a course in beauty culture when she
left school and now runs her own salon.
During the war she worked at night at
the American Red Cross Canteen, and
also for the A.C.F. A lover of music,
Margaret’s engagement gift from her
mother was a grand piano—she is a
skilled player. Bruce is the youngest
son of the late Mr. and Mrs. A. W.
Cornish, of Murrumbeena, and was with
the Ninth Division in the Middle East
and New Guinea. He is now adjutant at
Australian Headquarters Signals. Mar-
garet is wearing a solitaire diamond ring.
The wedding will take place later in the
year.
After Claudio Arrau, who is touring
Australia under the A.8.C., had given his
first Melbourne concert with the Sym-
phony Orchestra under Prof, Bernard
Heinze, he declared that the audience was
as responsive and warm-hearted as any
in his own country. The Chilean pianist
played the Beethoven Concerto No. 4.
Two well-known pianists were in the big
audience: Valda Aveling, here for
recitals, and Vera Bradford. Robin
Walters, daughter of Air-Commodore
A. L. Walters, in an olive-green frock,
was making it a last concert night before
leaving for a short Barrier Reef holiday.
Archbishop and Mrs. Booth were there ;
so was the Rt. Rev. D. McKid, Bishop
of Geelong, who came with University
Vice-Chancellor J. D. G. Medley and his
daughter Diana. Mrs. Bernard Heinze,
smart in a black formal gown, was
accompanied by her sons Julian and
Adrian. Hilda Corbett’s hat had a tight-
fitting pink crown and was trimmed at
one side with pastel-blue taffeta ribbon
twisted into swirls.
Miss Myra E. Roper, of London, a
Cambridge graduate, who has been
appointed principal of the University
Women’s College, Melbourne, succeeds
Dr. Greta Hort. Miss Roper was edu-
cated at Skipton-on-Craven High School
in Yorkshire, and at Newnham College,
graduating M.A. in 1937. Miss Roper
is also holder of a diploma of education
awarded by the London University’s In-
stitute of Education. She has taught in
England and America and was returning
from America in the Athenia when it was
torpedoed in 1939. In 1940, Miss Roper
was appointed assistant education officer
to Wiltshire County Council and from
1942-44 was with the Cambridge County
Council in a similar capacity. An experi-
enced public speaker on English language
and literature, and on education, she was
University Extension lecturer in English
literature at the Durham University. The
new appointee is also greatly interested in
drama and amateur theatricals and has
written and produced plays. It is ex-
pected that Miss Roper will take up her
appointment at the beginning of the
’Varsity third term,
From Sydney
Some of the girls dancing merrily at
the Coral Sea Ball couldn’t help think-
ing that “A mermaid’s lot is not a happy
one.” The mermaid, so pretty and slim
in her opalescent sea maiden garb, was
condemned gracefully to recline beside
the silver pool in the foyer all night
long. In this pool revellers fished industri-
ously for little fish which they exchanged
for leis. One of the first encountered
in the Trocadero ballroom was Mrs.
James Brasch (singer Alice Browse). In
a siren-like frock of mist-blue crepes
Alice sold tickets in a guessing competi-
tion. This was won by E. P. White, who
evidently knew how to make two and two
add up to Scotch —anyway the four
bottles went to him and his party.
The ball was a three-star success.
Frocks and the furs that accompanied
them even on that warm night were lus-
cious. All, coupons or no coupons, were
definitely post-war. White frocks seemed
first favorite, though black, of course, had
a great following. Mrs. Sam Jones, presi-
dent of the ball committee, and Mrs.
Frank Packer wore super white frocks.
The wife of America’s Consul-General
Orsen Neilson also chose white. Gold
sequins blazed glittering and decorative
trail about it. She and her husband were
importants of the night, for the ball was
organised by the Australian-American
Movement. And what a perfect alliance
were Mrs. W. R. Hauslaib’s pleated white
crepe frock and ermine coat! Mrs.
Florence Taylor slung a three-quarter
cape of midnight-blue sequins over her
pink chiffons, and artist Ted Scorfield’s
wife ruffled in bouffant black taffetas.
There was an orchestra softly twang-
ing Hawaiian music, there was a flutter
of girls selling leis. You didn’t buy your
own —in the good old Honolulu way
everybody decorated his neighbor. Ernest
Watt’s shoulders were decked with
tropical horticulture as soon as he
entered. Admiral G. D. Moore
and his wife were there, so were
General and Mrs. Berryman, and
Sydney’s Mayor Bartley and Mrs. Bartley.
Twinkling like a catch of stars were the
diamante encrustments on Mrs. Jacob-
sen’s ivory chiffons. The Anderson lady
and Mrs. H. Ranken were among the
noted. The Kangaroo and the Eagle
(American species) looked proudly out
from the decorative panel behind the
official table. Near by with a triumphal
air stood two high white pillars, from
one flowing the Stars and Stripes, from
the other Australia’s flag. Food for
Britain and the Australian-American
Movement share the takings.
This is pretty Elizabeth Gaye, who, as
Crete in “The Dancing Years,” brings
a spring-like quality (and not referring
to her dancing) to the part. Elizabeth,
in a galaxy of stars, was a little star
herself, twinkling very brightly.
“The Dancing Years” is a show you’ll
go to three or four times —the music has
a haunting charm, and there is something
absolutely fascinating to the ordinary
bungalow and flat-dweller about the high
rooms and long windows of heroine
Maria Ziegler’s home in Vienna. No
wonder those times are referred to as
“the spacious days of old.” Tara Barry,
as Maria, wears two white frocks of dis-
tinction —the first all rose-white sophisti-
cated simplicity, the second a magnificent
affair glittering with diamante and
sequins. Max Oldaker, as the hero,
composer Rudi, was quite at ease at the
piano—so he should be. Max is an
accomplished musician, with diplomas to
prove it.
The opening night of the show brought
breathless crowds bustling to the Royal
by 10 minutes to eight. In the packed
audience was Strella Wilson. Doris Fit-
ton sat in a box. Mrs. Vera Lacey,
examiner for the British Ballet Organisa-
tion, and Madame Scott (one-time pupil
of Jenny Brennan) kept keen eyes on the
dancing. Margaret Gillespie, the H. J.
Bradys (great admirers of Evelyn Gar-
diner), Mrs. Claude Plowman, Claude
Flemming, were among the noted. And
at the foot of the dress-circle stairs, after
the show, Harald Bowden stood receiving
as many congratulations as if he were
Ivor Novello.
The committee women of the Killara
Music Club had a grand time last week
when Boyd Neel and his orchestra gave
a concert in the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall.
First of all the orchestra arrived about
four o’clock to have a rehearsal. But
before they started they were given a hefty
afternoon tea. Later on Mrs. Hope Gibson
and other enthusiasts spread a buffet
dinner for the players in the hall, and then
came a concert that will live in the
Killara Club’s memory—the 18 players
sitting on red chairs just about the tone
of the covers of their music, though
that was quite unpremeditated. At the
back of the stage the Union Jack flowed
proud and free. After the concert every-
one, audience, players and all, stayed on
to supper.
Mayoress Bartley coo-eed about 200
guests to an afternoon of music in the
Town Hall vestibule last Thursday—the
civic lady’s Relief Fund will benefit.
Clem Williams, so soon to go to Maori-
land on a broadcasting tour, wife Enid
Conley, elegant in a matinee frock, the
trailing skirt of black satin, the bodice of
palest pink chiffon, composer Lindley
Evans and pretty Marie Bremner, in
quaker-grey ground-length chiffons, were
the artists on a programme mixed by
the cunning hand of Mrs. Hope Gibson.
All Autumn was caught in the crimson"
and yellow berries on the tea tables.
The Countess de Vilme-Hautmont
(Vinia de Loitte) was responsible for the
programme of “The Stars Will Call. ’
This was the Women Writers’ rally tor
the Food for Britain fund, and it filled
the Macquarie Auditorium to bursting
point one afternoon last week. It was
one of those audiences where everybody
knew her neighbor even to thfe uttermost
stall. Among top-liners who dropped in
and did their stuff were Wee Georgie
Wood and Minerva’s Megs Jenkins.
Radio man John Dunne, too, was one of
the afternoon’s hits. So were the nylon
stockings sent along by Dorothy Foster
of the popular Ada and Elsie partnership.
Auctioned by Dick Bentley they brought
£6. Mrs. H. J. Brady nobly handed over
21b. of tea, a special gift to her from
Ceylon. This was auctioned for £4. Mrs.
Ernest Salenger was the proud winner of
a brightly knitted Afghan. Flowers rich
and rare were brought in from the North
Shore line, and every woman present
bought a posy. Show opened with an
act of Noel Coward’s “Fallen Angels.”
Result, £lOO clear. Alice Gore Jones,
one of Brisbane’s leading presswomen,
was in the audience.
At the Victoria League Ball at the
Trocadero on May 22 the Frederick
Jordan lady will present a silver compact
to the member of the Young Contingent
who is tops of the Cities of Empire con-
test. There are 21 entrants, each repre-
senting one of the great cities of the
empire, and on the night of the ball al
the girls will be presented by Mrs. Harold
Nicholas.
Yesterday 33 military cadets from River-
view took the road in the Murray Valley
coach. They are off to Adelaide, not on
soldiering, but on social amenities bent
At Canberra a reception by American
Ambassador Butler was planned. Lieut
Frank Gorman and Captain Leonard
Skewes are at the controls.
Pianist and composer Frank Hutchens,
just back from his native Enzed, was the
guest speaker at the Josef Kretschmann
club last week. Frank wove a very vivic
pattern of Maoriland’s scenery and Maor
legends. But as a musician his sou
seemed to shrivel at the thought that
across the Tasman they have not kept
pace musically with Australia. He thinks
they should build a conservatorium to
train musicians and singers. Of course
his ear was enchanted with some Maori
oratory he had the chance to listen to—
“so musical and pleasing to the ear.’
Frank added that he had heard one of
the best choirs (30 voices sweet and
strong) outside of London, in hilly, windy
Wellington.
Sir Philip Gibbs’s autobiography. The
Pageant of the Years, is being read with
great attention by this writer’s admirers
in Sydney. In particular the last para-
graph holds a message not only for British
people but for all the peoples of the
world:
I have looked at life. I have seen and
loved the beauty of the world. Every-
where I have met pleasant, kindly, intelli-
gent people, missing for the most part the
evil ones and the torturers. It is because
of that that I still hope for the survival
of civilisation.
If I have learned anything it is that pity
is more intelligent than hatred, that mercy
is better even that justice, that if one walks
around the world with friendly eyes one
makes good friends.

The spring of £42,936 in last year’s
declared profit (£116,766) was due to
better returns from investments, mainly
steel and coal; the parent’s earnings from
merchandising, stevedoring, etc., con-
tinued to shrink. That was after allow-
ing for depreciation (£97,337, down
£3275) and taxation (£58,043, down
£4062). In addition £47,209 net was re-
ceived in Government subsidies, etc., iri
respect of previous years, £34,121 was
dropped from somewhere into reserves
and £24,032 was struck off against the
cost of reconditioning the fire-damaged
Invincible colliery, etc. Aggregate net
return from all sources was thus £174,064
(up £58,252), or sufficient to pay the pref.
div. and show 7.9 p.c. on ord. capital

8.3 p.c. back to 1939. Doubtful of what
the future holds, the board kept the div.
at 4i p.c., making the average 4.7 p.c.
over the last decade.
As for the future, the outlook for
shipping and coal, the co.’s two largest
interests, is obscure. Government con-
trol of coal and a policy of industrial
appeasement rather than justice have
failed to achieve increased output. One
consequence is that activity in trade and
industry generally has slowed down, to
the detriment of the national income
and all who depend upon it. Another
is that costs have risen to such a height
that at present selling prices of coal sur-
vival of the industry is dependent upon
payment of Government subsidy.
Shipping, once a handsome contributor
to the pool, has also become a poor re-
lation owing to Government interfer-
ence. During the war the Government
took over the fleets of coastal shipping
cos, and operated them, on charter, at
a heavy loss. Now the vessels are being
reconditioned and handed back to their
owners. But owing to the decision to re-
serve the coastal trade for Australian-
built ships, to be delicensed when 25
years old, the co. has already sold four
of the older units of the fleet and is
about to sell a fifth, the 34-year-old cargo
and passenger steamer Canberra. And,
until the board can see more clearly
what lies ahead, it is doing nothing to
replace them. The cost of the Cycle, one
of the co.’s cargo steamers built in U.K.
in 1939, was about £200,000 delivered in
Australia, The replacement cost today
would be £400,000-odd if built in U.K.
or £500,000-odd if constructed locally.
Thus so greatly have conditions
changed that for the cost of two ships
built in Australia today the co. could
have bought four similar ones in the U.K.
before the war. Also, overhaul and main-,
tenance costs are well over 100 p.c. above
pre-war level, and vessels now spend
about 66 p.c. of their time in port as
against 33 p.c. before the war. Further,
the 7s, interim lift in the basic wage in
December, plus another Is. in February,
the granting of attendance money of 12s.
a day and annual leave to waterside
workers, with the cost of the Stevedoring
Industry Commission and amenities,
will altogether run away with about
£1,350,000 p.a. And seamen are still
paid a “war-risk” bonus of 25 p.c. south
of Townsville and 33i p.c. north of that
port. It all adds up to substantial lifts
in freight, passenger and depreciation
charges or payment of a heavy subsidy,
either or both of which finally comes out
of the public’s pocket.
The undertaking is well ribbed financi-
ally;—

There is now £4,040,436 of capital to
feed in 20,000 6 p.c. and 125,000 7 p.c.
prefs. and 2,895,436 ords., all of £1 each.
Of the ords, 608,087 were offered and
snapped, one-for-four at par, at end
November last. In front of share capital
is £1,212,000 of debenture stock, of which
£300,000 was issued privately at £3 Bs. 9d.
p.c. last year. Investment interest centres
mainly in the ords., and rests firstly on
the security aspect and secondly on
prospects of capital gain from new share
issues to help finance expansion of the
undertaking.
The co. is the executive instrument in
the Government’s big scheme for the ex-
tension of electric current in south-eastern
Queensland. The work, shelved during
the war years, has been retarded since
by shortages of materials and labor and
by delays in delivery. Still, it is going
ahead as fast as circumstances will per-
mit.' The co. also holds a long-term fran-
chise covering the Tweed River district,
over the border in N. S. Wales. A Gov-
ernment-appointed committee co-ordi-
nates extension of the mains and fixes
prices for the current. The co. attends
to the difficult technical and other
problems upon which efficiency of the
undertaking depends.
The div. is anchored at 2 p.c. above
the rate carried by voluntarily-subscribed
Government loans issued during the
previous year. Prices for current are
calculated on this basis, after allowing for
exes., depreciation, a moiety for reserves
and the cost of debenture and pref.
capital. Last term £139,807 (= 2.4 p.c. of
cost of fixed assets) was allowed for de-
preciation, of which £18,869 was used
to write off the loss on disposals, leaving
the net addition to depreciation reserve
at £120,938, as shown in the table. The
£159,047 of profit that remained was
£28,574 more than the pref. and standard
ord. divs. called for, and reserves bene-
fited accordingly. The recent cut in the
rate on Government loans will reduce the
ord. div, to 5i p.c.
Despite deterioration in the quality of
coal used, last term’s generating efficiency
was the best yet. However, owing to lifts
in wage and other costs and higher de-
preciation charges on new equipment—
some of it is more than double pre-war
price—the co. has asked for an increase
in charges for current.
Last term’s expenditure on develop-
ment totalled £676,404, of which nearly
half was spent in country areas:
1939. 1946. 1947.

erating station at Bulimba, near the
present one, is expected to cost £2,366,000.
Under its debenture trust deed the co. is
entitled to issue a further £300,000 of
debenture stock. After that it will be
necessary to raise further share capital.
The amount and date of the next issue
will depend upon delivery of plant units
and availability of labor and materials.

Credit
for \ncreasing
Primary Production
THERE is a national call to all
■ those on the land to produce
more wheat and meat and dairy
products per acre and per man.
Such increased production will
not only ease the world’s food
problem, but it will better equip
each producer to remain on his
feet when prices fall.
This Bank has the resources
for helping graziers and farmers
to finance the development of
their properties so that greater
production may be had at lower
costs.
The Bank’s officers in Head
Office, and in more than 300
Branches, will be glad to discuss
the question of credit with those
desiring it for this purpose.
THE
COMMERCIAL BANKING COMPANY
OF SYDNEY LIMITED
ESTABLISHED 1834
with which is amalgamated
THE BAKU OF VICTORIA LID.
South Aus., put a record amount of new
business on the books —£1,312,714 (up
£296,116), of which £547,033 (up £153,858)
was ordinary and £765,681 (up £14,225)
industrial. A pleasing feature is that over
41 p.c. of the year’s new business was m
the O.D. as against 25.3 p.c. in 1941—a
policyholder derives more benefit from
an ordinary than from an industrial con-
tract.
Combining figures in both departments,
total income was £570,896 (up £28,807),
of which £454,345 (up £22,546) was pre-
miums and £116,551 (up £6243) interest,
rents, etc., After paying all legitimate
claims and exes., sending £758 to the staff
fund and handing shareholders 10 p.c.
(£5000), £196,069 was added to the as-
surance funds, raising them to £3,062,376.
And they have the support and assistance
of £90,072 of other reserves. Holders of
the £50,000 of share capital have had a
regular 10 p.c, for the last half-dozen
years. But the co. has to earn £9 for
policyholders in the O.D. before share-
holders are entitled to a pound.
Surpluses available for distribution (ex-
cess of assurance funds over policy liabili-
ties) compare as follows over the last six
triennial valuations;

Bonuses to O.D. policyholders range from
16s. p.c. on contracts less than five years
in force to 245. p.c. on those 15 years old
or more. These rates are the same as
for 1943, but only about half the pre-
war level. It is the common experience,
due mainly to the Government’s cheap-
money policy. I.D. bonus rates have
been maintained on a even keel. Incre-
ments on sums assured range from 5 p.c.
for five-to-nine-year-old policies to 10
p.c. for 15-year-old contracts, plus one
p.c, for each additional year. Thus a
claim under a 20-year-old policy would
be increased by 20 p.c. of the sum assured.
Payment of premiums cease, but bonuses
continue, when the assured reaches 75
years of age, provided the policy has been
in force for 20 years.
To help take some of the sting out of
the fall in interest rates and protect
bonus-paying capacity, the co. lowered the
basis of valuation of O.D. policy liabili-
ties from 3 p.c. to 2\ pis. in 1940, and
to 2% p.c. in 1943. As provision against
the possibility of a further cut, a special
actuarial reserve of £14,000 was set up
last term. In the I.D. the valuation rate
was lowered from 3£ p.c. to 3 p.c. in
1940, and to 2\ p.c. last year, when valua-
tion of policies up to 5 years in force was
also further strengthened at a cost of
£27,869.
After deducting taxes, the net interest
earned on mean assurance funds last
year was 3.72 p.c. as against 3.77, 3.84
and 3.92 p.c. for the three preceding
terms. So there is still a comfortable
margin between the actual and assumed
rates of earnings.
Assets are a satisfactory lot:

Government securities (up £130,012 last
term) now account for 75.4 p.c. of total
assets as against 59.7 p.c. in 1939. The
growth of £73,193 in shares in other cos.,
mainly Stock Exchange securities, reflects
a search for more remunerative invest-
ments.
At the annual meeting of Briseis Con-
solidated, N.L.—the end of its tin mine
at Derby (Tas.) was hastened by falls of
overburden and by drift in July last—
the chairman pointed out that during its
lifetime the co, (paid capital £150,000 in
ss, shares) handed those on the register
4s. 3d. a share in divs. and paid £64,315
(=2s. Id. per share) to the taxgatherer.
The point is that the co. and its share-
holders have paid heavy taxation on what
was virtually a part return of capital.
The authorities, however, are stubborn
in their refusal to exempt any portion of
income from mining from taxation. There
is no getting round the fact that a mine
is a wasting asset, which is gradually
consumed or exhausted in the process of
earning income, and is not subject to
depreciation through wear and tear. In
practice many complications arise in
connection with the treatment of wasting
assets in a co.’s accounts. From the
investor’s point of view the important
things to Fateh are the remaining life
of the mine, or other Wasting asset, the
board’s policy with regard to earnings
and distributions, and the co.’s liquid
position. If dividends are distributed up
to the hilt of earnings, without making
good wastage that has taken place in the
asset concerned, then dividends are a
part return of capital, and the investor
would be wise to recognise the fact. On
the other hand, if a co. operating a wast-
ing asset holds on to part of its earnings,
and invests the money in securities out-
side the business, the net value of such
securities is usually taken into account in
determining the value of the co.’s shares.

View, Gt. Boulder and Boulder Per-
severance in one, and South Kalgurli,
North Kalgurli and Paringa in the other,

other suggested group is that of Mt. Char-
lotte, Maritana blocks, Hannans North

site and from two to two and a half miles
north of Golden Mile.

SUNDRY SHOWS
SHIVARAM.
It would be interesting to speculate on
the direction Australian ballet dancing
might have taken had there been no
White Australia and had there been a
close cultural liaison between this country
and Hindustan. As there hasn’t, Mel-
bourne has had to wait for the enterprise
of the National Theatre to bring out
Shivaram, the first Indian artist to visit
Australia.
A thin, lithe, golden-skinned youth, who
shows every evidence of having been
trained in as hard a school as the Rus-
sians and in one as hoary with traditions,
Shivaram is able to do extraordinary
things with his eyes and fingers, while his
feet and his head are working out an
entirely different set of rhythms. Asa
mime he can knock spots off all but the
most eminent of the Russians and he was
amazingly expressive as a hermit waking
from contemplation and walking through
the forest, giving, so to speak, bodily
reflection to the trees, a cobra, a lion, a
lake and a bee which settles in a lotos
blossom and gets trodden on by an
elephant. It is difficult to imagine this
language of gesticulation or the art of
movement being carried further.
Indian dancing, of course, is stiff with
convention ; but then so is the Russian.
The difference between the two schools,
however, is that the Russian is more
voluptuous than the Indian —on this show-
ing of it, anyway. There is no sensuality
in Shivaram, even when he is the Hindu
Cupid performing a languorous dance
amidst the Spring flowers, or the love-
god Krishna pinching their clothes from
the gopies 'filling their waterpots at the
river.
The young man’s Peacock Dance was
a remarkable performance which made
even Pavlova’s Dying Swan seem not such
a rare bird.
“King Rugmangadan” was a drama
from the Mahabharatha and the rules of
technique were laid down about the time
of Edward the Confessor. It is all about
a king who is enveigled into slaying his
own son to please a celestial charmer,
and no modern choreographer or master
of decor has thought up anything as fan-
tastic or queerly suggestive. The brilli-
ance of the costumes and the haunting
Indian music—which has considerable
variety and beauty despite its monoton-
ous jazz rhythm—added to the general
strangeness.
Ruth Bergner, Ali Rogers and the rest
of the 17 Melbourne dancers trained in
ŵ
”The dancing years.”
With what seems to be low cunning,
J. C. Williamsons have scattered the
Borovansky Ballet numbers through all
three acts of “The I)ancing Years,”
described as a “musical play devised,
written and composed by Ivor Novello.”
To see the Borovanskys it thus becomes
necessary to endure the full three hours
of Mr. Novello’s tenuous and sentimental
devisings, writings and compositions.
It is difficult to imagine a stronger
contrast. Mr. Novello’s devisings are
slow, laborious and sentimental, even for
musical comedy ; the Borovanskys flash
through his swamp like quick, bright
birds. The quickest and brightest of
them is Edna Busse, who has the essen-
tial dramatic instinct to transform her
lightness, precision and hair-spring
vitality into apparently perfect dancing.
In Martin Rubinstein she has an excel-
lent partner —an admirable and sensitive
dancer—and their lightness and gaiety in
the Tyrolean Dance provide the best
moments of the Royal’s programme.
The misty white beauty of “Lorelei,”
the imaginative miming (which the Boro-
vanskys have developed to the nth de-
gree) and dancing in “Masque of
Vienna,” and the “Mazurka” of Tamara
Tchinarova and Serge Bousloff make up
the substance of the ballet’s brief ap-
pearance, But, brief as it is, it’s a most
substantial foretaste of what can be ex-
pected when the Borovanskys present a
full season of ballet in Sydney.
"QEdipus Rex."
No attempt was made by Eileen
O’Keefe, of the Melbourne University
Drama Classes, to give anew twist to
Sophocles’ tremendous drama, put on in
a local translation by George Gellie at the
Union Theatre. It was just as well. There
is no necessity whatever to tamper with
Greek stage convention, and even the
playing of the drama from start to finish
with no intervals or curtains is an ad-
vantage, for Sophocles wrote his play with
the same simplicity and dramatic skill as
Noel Coward brought to the film “Brief
Encounter.” The chorus of white-bearded
Theban elders provided the only semi-
colons needed in the two hours.
The play was extraordinarily well done
into the bargain. As the son who,
ignorant of his parentage, fulfils the gods
by killing his father and marrying his
mother, Alan Money dominated the even-
ing, and his final agony when he stabs his
eyes out with his mother’s brooch pins
ẃ
Warwick Braithwaite.
Conductor Warwick Braithwaite
opened his first Sydney concert, at the
Town Hall, with “Rienzi,” and gave!
Wagner his full due in a reading which
nearly buckled the clockface at the
eastern gallery. In Samuel Barber’s
“Adagio for Strings” the conductor
stepped straight into another musical
world and evoked a beautiful bal-
ance from the various string sections.
But if proof were needed that Mr. Braith-
waite could be master of tranquillity as
well as vigor he unquestionably supplied
it in the andante movement of Mozart’s
“Haffner” Symphony, in which the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra did its best
work for months. Tschaikowsky’s Fourth
Symphony, with its many surprising
transitions, went back to the bold style.
The conductor kept a nice adjustment
between voice and orchestra when Lorna
Sydney sang the “Che Faro” from
Gluck’s “Orpheus and Euridice” and the
“Adieu” from Tschaikowsky’s “Jeanne
D’Arc,” both splendidly sung.
The second Braithwaite concert was
severe in the extreme. It included
Moeran’s Symphony, rather less a work
than a disease ; Rawsthorne’s “Cortege,”
a work which smacks of the competent
tradesman rather than of the genius;
Boughton’s Oboe Concerto, in which
Horace Green achieved sustained lucidity
and fine phrasing, and Vaughan Wil-
liams’s “Fantasia on a Theme of Tallis,”
the best of a generally wretched selection
of contemporary composers.
Arthur Murch's Painting.
Eighteen paintings and some drawings
by Arthur Murch, at the Macquarie Gal-
leries, Sydney, are not, on the whole,
representative of what this artist can do.
“Venus” in the net, a study of a nude on
a bed, with a cat on the floor, has a
sculptural effect of solidity and a careful
and pleasing composition of light. It is,
however, stiff and wooden and a com-
parison has only to be made with the
cold magic of “Les Felins,” at the
N. S. Wales National Gallery, for one to
realise what might have been done with
such a subject.
There are some charming, slight draw-
ings and “The Bush Fire” is—not un-
naturally—a warm mass of color. Land-
scapes are unreal- —Murch at his worst —
particularly the dim and dull “Camp at
the Bridge.”
“The Assignation,” a “Ledo and the
Swan” painting (a subject for which
Murch, and many other artists, have a
fondness), is charming within the limits
of subject and treatment, Leda’s body re-
flecting both warm flesh tones and the
cool green of the water. More might have
been made of the swan.
The gem of the show —a small gem —
is “The Party,” a painting of a group
around a table, every character clearly
and powerfully projected, every detail
built up to a final, festive statement.
There is one weakness —carelessly painted
hands.
A similar emphasis on character m
some of Murch’s nudes would give them
vitality, where at present they are anony-
mous.

Adelaide Society of Arts shows well
over 100 paintings in its autumn exhibi-
tion, but has rejected almost as many
more. President George Whinnen domi-
nates the show. Nora Heysen, Good-
child and Howie exhibit good work,
but the only purchase by the National
Gallery is a very “modern” farm-scene
by Max Ragless.
Reviewed Briefly.
Artbursts
The aboriginal drawings and paintings
of James at Velasquez Gallery,
Melbourne, were done during a stay of
nine months in native camps on the Daly
and the Adelaide rivers in the N.T. They
are a good illustration of the fact that
art has nothing to do with propaganda.
In his dark and roughly-painted oils of
drunken half-castes, white bosses and
native hirelings, tobacco handouts and
other familiar scenes of the outback,
Wigley has endeavored to arouse the
sympathy of the white Australian for the
degradation, misery and mismanagement
of original owners of the country. All
he arouses is irritation at his own in-
ability to establish the simplest relations
of color, tone and form in his pictures.
Nobody feels that about Rembrandt’s
paintings of similarly persecuted Jews
and beggars. Mr. Wigley’s drawings,
where he' hasn’t tried to be propagandist,
are better, though some of them intrude
into the domain of caricature. “Argu-
ment,” a sincere sketch of an abo. vir-
ago in a nightdress pouring out vitupera-
tion on the landscape, is one of the best
of them.

Stage and Concert
The opening number of his Sydney
Conservatorium concert, the “Sound An
Alarm” from “Judas Maccabaeus,” found
John Dudley short of a declamatory
gallop—it was Handel fed on chicken
rather than on lusty beef. In the ensuing
Brahms and Strauss group, however, the
tenor more than atoned by delicate
and sensitive interpretations of four
splendid songs. “II Mio Tesoro” and
“E Lucevan le Stelle” were lyric
singing of a high order. In the final
group of ballads the tenor brought down
the house with Cyril Scott’s “Lord
Randall” —an interpretation in which fire
and pathos were beautifully blended.
Over every song was perfection of
enunciation in four languages.

“Calcutta” (Sydney State): For those

chief criminal and manages to get back
to work on time sporting a healthy tan
and without a hair of his noble thatch
out of place.

HEN you strike a match you are not only playing
1 with fire, but with explosives as well. An or-
dinary match consists of a wooden stem tipped with
phosphorus and potassium chlorate, bound together
with glue. Some powdered glass or similar material
is added to the mixture to promote friction when the
match is struck. The wooden stem of the match is
usually impregnated with paraffin wax to ensure
that it will burn properly after it has been kindled.
When you “strike a match,” the friction between
the rough striking surface and the powdered glass
in the match head produces enough heat to explode
the potassium chlorate. This miniature explosion
sets fire to the phosphorus, which in its turn ignites
the stalk of the match. The wooden match stalk
is, of course, a natural product, but
everything else that makes a match
comes from the British chemical
industry.

Anv punter who was ahead of it after an
hour and a half at Rosehill on Saturday must
Save been using a better pin than the others
The reckless turned up in droves, they took
the father of a hiding, and did they ask for it.
It wasn’t a race meeting; it was a con-
spiracy. A perfect sunny afternoon to entice
them along; the local programme seven events
as open as the day, including a couple of
fixed-weight Maidens, an Encourage, a field
of off-season two-year-olds, and other snares
and pitfalls; and, as if that wasn’t trap enough,
the bullfrog sirens’ chorus of odds about Bris-
bane and Melbourne tothe catchy tune of
“Come in, suckers!” They d have fallen as
readily for a meeting of emus, roos, galahs
and goannas broadcast from nor -west of Mun-
gindi.
On the principle of ■ “Better the devil you
know than the angel you don’t,’ they shovelled
the notes, at cramped odds, on every Sydney
animal starting in Brisbane; and not a solitary
one got home. It was a sight to see them
waving whole fistfuls of tenners, fairly pleading
to get set on the palpably overweighted Victory
Lad in the Moreton Handicap, and being
turned down! That was the big money, but
as much in quids went on Blue Legend and
Wirralie, despite their indifferent form up north
and the very different form of the ultimate
winner and runner-up, the Queenslanders belt
Force and Wild Buck.
The same thing happened in the other main
Brisbane event, the six-furlongs Hinkler Han-
dicap, for which the Rosehill enthusiasts slapped
their diminishing rolls on Hiraji as if they d
taken a set on the stuff. As Felt Force had
done over the Moreton 10 furlongs, Dow-
borough led all the way. It might have been
some sort of sad pleasure for the battered to
have heard the description of Hiraji coming
from far back to get within a short head of
Dowborough, but even that was denied them
by the broadcast cutting off. A tragic sight
was one of the very few who’d backed Dow-
borough. On the verge of tears, he was reiterat-
ing to the book, “1 done in me ticket. 1
dunno how. X done in me ticket.” Maybe he
ate it. They’ve been known to eat jamtins.
On the face of things, Queensland form
would seem pretty hot; but that could prove
misleading. A more accurate view, based on
the cold facts, might be that, as at the Mel-
bourne autumn meeting, Sydney form has been
overrated. In the Melbourne Newmarket, for
instance, the Sydney nags copped the top
poundage as far as four or five down the list,
and were not in the hunt. Similarly in Bris-
bane they had the top poundage in the big
double and in other events. Wellington (B.lof
was downed in the Stradbroke by Hedui (7.13),
while topweight Victory Lad (9.7) and other
Sydney horses weighted above the well-
performed winner were all unplaced.
Also, as a Melbourne Cup winner and un-
questionably fine stayer, Russia no doubt
merited his 9.9 in the Brisbane Cup, but it
might pay to remember that Blue Boots, who
beat him, carried only 7.5. In the Moreton
on Saturday both Blue Legend and Victory
Lad had 9.6, the nearest Queenslander to them
being Wild Buck with 8.2, while the winner,
Felt Force, had only 7.1.
The foregoing isn’t a criticism of the handi-
capping; when weights were issued the best
Queensland form had yet to be revealed. As
an example of the bandicapper being right
when apparently going against the records,
Hiraji, giving half a stone to Dowborough, got
within a whisker of beating that son of Bern-
borough’s sire. Yet in a comparison of per-
formances Hiraji would seem overrated at those
weights. When Dowborough was taken to Syd-
ney shrewd placing would have won a fortune
with him. As it was, it took Shannon flat-out
to down him, Shannon having to clip seconds
off the Rosehill record to do it. Against that,
Hiraji, though maybe the best son of Nizami
so far, has been just a good honest galloper.
As a reverse example, the brilliant Seven
Fifty colt Sefiona was downed in Saturday’s
Claret Stakes by the Queensland-owned but
southern-bred Titan colt Gold Titan. This was
the exact opposite to the Cup, Moreton Handi-
cap and other events, the Queensland Sefiona
having to lump 9.10 and the. southern Gold
Titan being in it with 8.1.
When weights are levelled up a bit it should
be seen how good are Blue Boots and Felt
Force; and it will take a tidy bit of levelling
to offset the fact that Felt Force in his two
recent wins ran two records, equalling the
Australian 1.49$ for nine furlongs, and on
Saturday setting the new Eagle Farm figure
of 2.2 for 10 furlongs. It must mean some-
thing that the nine-furlongs record was made
on this same track and has stood since 1926,
though the distance is one frequently raced.
One of the oldest records, it was set by Fuji
San. The Australian record for 10 furlongs is
Beau Vite’s Fuji San carried 9.11, Beau
Vite 9.4, Felt Force 7.1 each time.
Decidedly, it’s been all to the good for both
Brisbane and Australian racing drat this year
the Queenslanders were able to hold off the
invaders. It would be good to see Felt Force,
Blue Boots, Wild Buck, Sefiona and others head-
ing south in the spring, and very interesting
to see what those canny gentlemen the handi-
cappers think of them.

At Rosehill the punters’ slide to penury be-
gan with the St. Andrew colt Lucky Me (F.
Walker), at 14 to 1, downing the hot favorite
Kardella, Overland and other two-year-olds.
Kardella, a big, fine-looking bronze-brown,
must get there soon. Romany King looks
better than he ran; he seemed a bit jerky in
his prelim.
Also ridden by apprentice Walker, Tyche,
at 12 to 1, took the first Maiden from Sweep
and Kentish Knight; then Skymaster (H. Rus-
sell), at 20 to 1, beat the favorite, Monsoon,
and Gracious in the Encourage. The books’
bags, by this time bulging, may have been
eased a little when the favorite. Namesake
(J. Thompson), won the next Maiden, but
placegetters Crispian and Beau Brumrqel car-
ried plenty of money.
Thompson made it a doable by landing Star
Vite ahead of Bundagen and Double Mint m
the .Flying, with the favorite, Glencrag, no-
where. The form of Bundagen looked par-
ticularly promising. The day’s only winning
favorite was Spearex (W. Cook), too good for
Concise and Early Love in the 10-furlongs
RosehiU Handicap. Spearex should soon win
again. The Welter, a last body blow to the
bulk of backers, was mainly notable for a nice
bit of riding by new apprentice Holman on
Eastralia, landing the gelding with only hands
and heels against a hard-ridden challenge by
the experienced Thompson on Tengur. The
grey Agile was third

turn. There seemed some promise in the way
the pacemaker stuck on for second money.
John Masefield ran yet another placing; this
time third.
Both divisions of the six-furlongs Seaside
Handicap for two-year-olds produced capital
finishes, the Hostile colt Tumult being a shade
too solid for Dick Turpin and Jalna, and the
Portofino gelding Star Port narrowly defeating
Dumfries, with Broadcast third.
All old hands at the game, and all weighted
well above the rest of the field, Garofil, Tente
and Fugleman took the Spotswood Steeple
prizemoney, in that order. Ihe other winners
in an admirably-balanced day’s racing were
Meadower, who beat Stormy Sea half a head,
with Gilwell third, in the 10-furlongs Gelhbrand
Handicap for three-year-olds; Hemlock, who
accounted for Chatsol and Buzhanne m the
main distance event; and Gayness, too good
for Delano and Linemond in the Welter.

South Australia’s noted Goodwood Handi-

In other days a local vinery presented Gov-

elixir so tickled the Gov.’s palate that he
allowed the name of Galway Pipe to be given
to the wine, and the wine people gave it to
the horse. The S.A. St. Leger was won by
the Chatham colt Conservator, at odds-on.

N.S.W. administration must take some
share of the responsibility for the defeat
of the N.S.W. Rugby Union team by
Queensland, 28-25, at Brisbane, as some
of the tourists were not fit. It was, how-
ever, one of the hardest of recorded inter-
state games. If centres Howell and Allen
had been able to get the ball out to Ton-
kin and Bastes the score would have been
different; credit for their failure belongs
to Queenslanders Bourke and Wilson.

Somewhat cocky because it had won
the first-three games of the season, Foots-

followed by about 40,00 onlookers, and

sult put Collingwood—which recorded its
fourth win of the season, beating “Sowth”
19.24-12.14 —clear in the lead, Carlton,
Fitzroy and Essendon being next, with
Footscray hanging round the outskirts.
Fitzroy ran idly about the North Mel-
bourne ground, kicking goals and looking
for the local team, which sneaked out oc-
casionally to run up 4.15 to 19.26. Mel-
bourne meantime walloped Richmond,
18.12-10.12; Essendon did the same to

Walter Hammond made three interesting
points: (1) “If the impression had been

quite wrong. Mistakes were made, but
no umpire is infallible. With every con-
fidence I can say the umpires did their
very best and were impartial. (2)
“Bumpers were more frequent than neces-
sary, but the laws were not infringed. ’
(3) “Enthusiasm was extraordinary and
there was never any doubt about the
friendliness towards England and English
cricket. The team’s visit, in spite ot
anything the English people may have
heard, helped to cement friendship be-
tween Britain and Australia and New Zea-
land.” The summing-up of a fine captain

Light-heavyweight Doug Brown has
struck trouble in each of his two scraps
at Leichhardt, having been fouled there
by Tommy Colteaux, who was “disquali-

extended holiday, along with A 1 Walker,
after a most ungladiatorial display in the
same arena. Brown (12.6) won round
one, but Walker (12.9) twice knocked him
down, once for “nine,” in the second, and
seemed to have the fight, or event, won.
Walker, however, didn’t press the advan-
tage, so’ in the fifth Brown came back and
floored him, also for “nine.” Carted
to his corner, Walker again collapsed,
whereupon referee Art Mawson muttered
“No fight.” The crowd roared “Rub ’em
out!” and the powers did.

The Share Premium Conundrum
The time has come for the Federal
Treasurer to divorce company finance
and accounting from politics, and to
make a plain statement of the broad prin-
ciples of policy followed by the Capital
Issues Committee, especially in relation
to the terms of new share issues—
whether they should be made at par or at
a premium. No recognisable pattern can
be traced in the large number of new
issues of ord. shares thus far authorised
by the committee. For this and other
reasons, including the absence of any
worth-while economic purpose, many con-
sider that the Treasury should cease
dictating to boards of directors and their
skilled advisers the terms on which new
issues of share and debenture capital
should be made.
At present such issues in excess of
£25,000 in two years, and the terms
thereof, must first be approved by the
committee, - which is an instrument of
the Treasury. Last October the Treasurer
indicated that a premium would not
“necessarily” be insisted upon, but that
applicants should state their reasons for
not wishing to make a new issue at a
premium, and that each case would be
considered according to the circumstances
surrounding it. Last week he is reported
to have said in reply to a question in
Parliament that several new issues had
been made at a premium, but in the
majority of cases terms were determined
voluntarily by the cos. concerned. What-
ever that might mean it certainly sheds no
light on the principle underlying the
policy of the committee, and that is what
is perplexing co. directors, shareholders
and the market alike.
The puzzling thing is the wide diverg-
ence in the “bonus element” of issues
authorised by the committee. By “bonus
element” is meant the difference be-
tween the market value of a co.'s
shares and the amount to be sub-
scribed for new shares of the same class
and amount and ranking pari passu. The
following examples illustrate the point:
Ord. Issue Value*
Amt. Price. Rights.
£ s. d. s. d.
Drug Houses (£1
shares) .. .. 314,531 27 6 8 6
Felt and Textiles
(£1 shares) .. 312,578 40 0 19 6
Prestige (10s. shares) 244,067 10 0 11 0
Berlei (£1 shares) 50,000 40 0 18 6
Woolworths (ss.
shares) .. .. 279,125 5 0 19 6
Edments (£1 shares) 25,000 20 0 36 9
* Approximate.
The figures rule out the “bonus element”
argument (a socialistic and dog-in-the-
manger idea) on the grounds of incon-
sistency and discrimination. There is no
difference, so far as effective usage is
concerned, between capital injected into
an undertaking in the form of shares and
capital representing premiums on shares.
Why then does the Treasury continue in
the role of dictator as to terms on which
new shares are to issued? The Treasurer
should cease sheltering behind the iron
curtain of silence and provide the answer,
or discontinue the practice.
Genuine differences of opinion exist
concerning the merits of issuing shares at
a premium. In the past all the English
banks operating in Australia —’Asia,
Union and E., S. and A.—have issued new
shares at substantial premiums. Many
large Australian industrial organisations,
including 8.H.P., have done so too. The
’Asia capitalised £1,000,000 of its share
premiums by a bonus share issue in 1920,
and has continued to charge premiums on
new share issues since. In 1939 B.H.P.
similarly capitalised £4,445,859 of the
share premiums it had gathered since
1912, and in 1941 made a new issue of
2,465,118 £1 ords. at par. David Jones
issued 200,000 new £1 ords. at a premium
of 10s. each in 1936, and in November
last capitalised the premiums (£100,000).
Another example is Mcllraths, Ltd.,
which recently capitalised a share
premium reserve of £116,000.
What was good practice in the past is
not necessarily so under the altered con-
ditions of today. The virtue of charging
the owners of a business a premium on
money put up by them to finance ex-
pansion of their own undertaking is
open to question, because it creates a
position that lends itself to easy misrepre-
sentation, innocent or deliberate, by poli-
ticians and others of socialistic per-
suasion. It results in an unreal rate of
dividend arising from an artificially high
rate of earning power in relation to sub-
scribed capital. The actual return on new
shares taken up at a premium of 100 p.c.
would be only half the declared rate of
dividend. Hence the greater the share
premium the more nominal becomes the
declared rate of dividend, which, by itself,
thus becomes an exaggerated statement of
the actual return to shareholders on the
money put up by them in such cases.
Special circumstances apart, the broad
question is whether such a thing is ex-
pedient under existing conditions.
Next Commonwealth Government
Loan, to be offered during the last
“Get these half-soled for us , sister!"
quarter of 1947, will carry the same rate
of interest (£3 2s. 6d. p.c.) as longer-
dated securities in the recent loan, but
no short-term 2 p.c. securities will be
offered. Practically all paper taken in
recent two-term issues has been for the
longer period. Advance applications,
bearing interest from date of lodgment,
are already being received for the next
issue. Latest figures for the recent loan
showed over-subscription by nearly £5
million, with more than 700,000 sub-
scribers. Minimum prices for Govern-
ment Loans, originally introduced as an
emergency wair measure by arrangement
between the Commonwealth Government
and the Stock Exchanges, were discon-
tinued as from May 6. Apparently the
immediate success of the recent loan
served to emphasise that
minimum prices were no
longer required.

Steps being taken by
the committee of the
Melbourne Stock Ex-
change to evolve a
standard share - transfer
form will, if successful,
result in a great conveni-
ence to brokers and their
clients. Common forms
of transfer at present in
use are not acceptable
by all cos., while the
special forms which
some cos. insist upon are
often confusing to the
investor. The problem
has been to evolve a
form which, while com-
plying with all legal re-
quirements and retaining
special provisions which
individual cos. might re-
gard as indispensable,
still remains essentially
simple. Such a form has
now been drafted by the
Australasian Institute of
Secretaries. According to
the Council of the Law
Institute of Victoria, it
satisfies legal requirements, and it has the
approval of the Victorian Council of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in
Australia. The committee of the Stock
Exchange, in circularising specimen forms
among public cos., requests that they will
accept transfers when executed by means
of this form, or that co. forms will be
similar to that recommended.

Further expansion of the building-
materials section of the business has been
announced by C.S.R. In co-operation
with Johns-Manville Corp., leading build-
ing-materials manufacturers of U.S.A. and
Canada, a factory is to be erected at Con-
cord, Sydney, for production of asphalt
tile flooring. The new material is “a
resilient, quiet, decorative, long-wearing
floor, applicable over virtually any smooth
and firm underfloor, and is particularly
adapted for service in commercial and
public buildings.” C.S.R.’s other activi-
ties in building materials include estab-
lishment of the fibre-board industry in
1938, erection of *a plaster mill at Con-
cord and a gypsum w<dlboard factory to
work in conjunction with the plaster mill,
arid there are asbestos, plants in Tasmania
and Westralia. Price of the co.’s f.-p. £2O
shares recently eased from £54 10s. to
£53 15s. At the lower figure the return
is approx. 3 p.c. on an 8 p.c, div. basis.

Maoriland’s largest biscuit factory has
been planned by Bycroft, Ltd., Auckland,
for erection on a site at Otahuhu,
nine miles from the city. It’s 10 years
since Bycroft launched out by expanding
capital from £25,000 to £125,000, and
embarkfed on an ambitious building and
plant-extension programme, with one eye
on front-place in Dominion biscuit-mak-
ing. Chairman G. R. Hutchinson says
the machinery, of latest type, is ready for
shipment from Britain when the co. gives
the word ; and J. P. O’Connor, the ener-
getic managing-director, recently spent
six weeks investigating biscuit-manufac-
turing methods in Australia. Bycroft s
flour mill ranks second only to North
Roller Milling Co. in output, and together
they are consumers of the lion’s share of
the millions of bushels of Australian
wheat imported into Maoriland to supple-
ment the Dominion’s inadequate produc-
tion.

Clyde Engineering Expands
When the proposed nuptials between
Clyde Engineering Co. and Paul and
Gray, Ltd., have been duly performed,
the former co. will take over a ready-
made merchandising outlet for its own
marine, aircraft and automotive manu-
factures. These products became an im-
portant part of Clyde’s output during
war-time. Their continuance in some de-
gree is now ensured by Government
policy ; marine business, for instance, will
be aided by the decision to reserve all
coastal trade for Australian-built ships,
which are to be replaced every 25 years.
On the R.A.A.F. station at Bankstown
(N.S.W.) the co. has already established
an aircraft engineering v/orkshop.
The present merger appears to be only
one step in what Clyde’s chairman calls
“a policy of forming a group of manu-
facturing and merchandising organisa-
tions.” Nominal capital is being increased
from £500,000 to £2,000,000. In its pre-
war range of production —locomotives,
railway trucks, bridge materials, etc. —
the co. has a large accumulation of orders
to supply, but by widening its scope the
directors hope to achieve greater stability
and continuity than was experienced dur-
ing the ’thirties, when the co. suffered
heavy losses.
The present acquisition cannot be re-
garded as inexpensive. Paul and Gray
shareholders, if they ratify the agreement,
will sell their business in return for
150,000 Clyde fully-paid ords. of £l, to-
gether with £50,000 in cash. This repre-
sents a total of 50s. each for the 80,000
issued shares in Paul and Gray, whose
face-value is 20s. each, and net tangible
backing at June 30 last was 355. 2d.
Actually, with the present ’Change
price of more than 225. for Clyde
shares, Paul and Gray holders are to
receive about 535. 9d. per share.
When official ceilings were imposed in
1942 these. Paul and Gray shares
were worth 255.; they were at the
revised ceiling of 33 s. 6d. when
controls ended last December; and sales
were recorded during February at 41s.
The present co. began only in 1933, ris-
ing from the ashes of the old Paul and
Gray, Ltd., which had gone into liquida-
tion two years previously. In addition to
being ship chandlers and hardwood mer-
chants, the new co. acquired agencies for
marine engines, pleasure craft and air-
craft components. Divs, averaged 5 p.c.
for the first three years, 8 p.c. for the
next seven and have been at 10 p.c. since
1944, with reserves now standing at
£60,687. Most lines imported by Paul
and Gray before the war are now being
made in Australia, and the co. has con-
sidered instituting its own manufactur-
ing programme. The present negotiations
apparently began about six months ago,
when A. T. Anderson, a director and
general manager of Paul and Gray, joined
the board of Clyde Engineering.
Paul and Gray will now operate as a
proprietary co. and a subsidiary of Clyde
Engineering. Shareholders of the former
Paul and Gray, Ltd., will retain their
corporate structure under the changed
name of Palgrave Corporation, Ltd.; this
co. will be represented on Clyde’s board,
and its shares will be listed officially.
The merger announcements have had
divergent effects on the two cos.’ share
prices. Buying price for Paul and Grays
was 455. immediately prior to the an-
nouncement and has since risbn to 51s. 6d.
Clyde shares were sold at 245. on the eve
of the announcement, fell to 21s. 6d. two
days later, and have now recovered to
about 235. 6d.
Pastoral and agency cos. have not
found the going easy in Maoriland, and
ord. shareholders in some concerns have
had to be content with meagre returns.
For cos. domiciled overseas chief hurdle
lias been double taxation. Among local
enterprises holders of ord. stock in the
North Auckland Farmers’ Co-op., Ltd.,
have received no div. since 1920, and
srefs. have been skipped five times. Some-
what similar is the record of Newton
King, Ltd., New Plymouth, which has
paid only one ord. div. in its 27 years,
and that when the shares were written
down from £1 to 3s. each, in 1929-30,
when the distribution was 6j p.c. Now
Newton King thinks the time has come
to give shareholders a better deal. On
May *29, shareholders will be asked 4 to-
approve payment of one year’s pref. div.'
of 5| p.c. (£9074) in full settlement of
nine years’ arrears (£86,143) from 1931
to 1939, and to agree to reduce the pref.
rate to 5 p.c. If ordinary shareholders in
future are paid more than 4 p.c. the prefs.
are to get half of any such excess until
their rate reaches a maximum of 6 p.c.,
but shareholders of long standing will
doubtless count themselves lucky if they
receive the proposed basic rates without
interruption. Newton King’s capital is
£204,529, in 174,500 6} p.c. cum. ,prefs.
of 3s. each, all fully paid, and 200,195
ords. Cancellation of pref. div. arrears
was approved by shareholders in 1940,
but that move and a scheme to convert
pref. capital into debenture stock were
barred by Finance Emergency Regula-
tions. Today there shouldn’t be any hitch.

A Canadian professor (D. C. Mac-
Gregor) recently discussed the price of
gold from a new angle. Stating that he
saw no immediate necessity for the
United States to raise the price of gold,
he said that if commodity prices rose ap-
preciably higher, and more especially if
the rise was world-wide, the long-term
outlook was for higher gold prices, too.
Gold used to be spoken of as determin-
ing, or at any rate limiting, the move-
ment of prices. Today, owing to the
overexpansion of paper money and bank
credit, the net pressure of economic
forces seemed to work in the opposite
direction, and the possibility of com-
modity prices determining those of gold
had now got to be considered.

Holeproof’s nine separate manufactur-
ing units in Vic. and N.S.W. were all
kept humming last year. Release of sur-
plus raw silk by the Government enabled
pure silk hosiery to be turned out again.
Regular releases of this silk largely coun-
teracted the shortage of rayon and other
hosiery yarns. New plant is on order in
England and America, but nobody knows
yet when it will arrive. Nominal capital
has been lifted to £750,000, by creation
of 400,000 new £1 shares, but how many
of them are to be offered, and when and
on what terms, have yet to be announced.
Though buyers increased their bid for
the ords. to 365. 6d., returning 4.4 p.c. on
last year’s 8 p:c. div. basis, sellers remain
in their shells.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”; Bob the Battler, bearded
and full of beer, took himself away from
the Murrayville (Vic.) pub, lurched along
the Cowangie-road and threw himself
down in the shade of a mallee clump to
sleep it off. In that mallee were clusters
of the caterpillars of the gum saw-fly
moth —the black, yellow-headed and
whiskery things which wave their heads
about and spit some yellow secretion
when disturbed. Presently Kelly, prince
of bush jesters, discovered Bob, eyed him
thoughtfully, saw the grubs and returned
to the village, got the necessary tools and,
now followed by an eager crowd who
knew Kelly, went out and carefully
shaved off half the sleeping Bob’s beard.
Time passed while we sat hidden in the
scrub. Then Bob awoke, blearily looked
around, saw the spitting grubs and
squirmed away. He sat up, ran an in-
quiring hand over the smooth half of his
dial, looked incredulously at those grubs
and then headed for Murrayville. “Strike
me up a gum-tree,” he was telling the
goggle-eyed publican when we arrived.
“You know them flamin’ spittin’ grubs?
Ate half me whiskers orf while I’m snooz-
in’. Gripes, if I * hadn’t ha’ woke up
they’d ha’ h#d me bald. Gimme a drink,
boss, I’m orf t’ Upper Gippsland. They
only got dingoes there.”
* * * *
“Two Bob”: A lot of townspeople,
| hearing of the way the birds sing in the
bush, go out seeking the songs and return
full of complaints that they hardly heard
a thing. This is because they go tramping,
usually in company, through the bush,
talking to one another and making the
crashing sounds of booted bipeds away
from their pavements, whereupon the
astonished and timid birds quell their
voices and sit mute or flit in trepidation
to other parts. The way to hear the bush
birds singing is to select an attractive spot,
sit down there and remain quiet. I’ll
guarantee that within a half-hour you’ll
have your feast of melody.
¥ * * *
“Wippegong”: All the Asiatic birds in-
troduced to this country —mynas, bulbuls,
doves —stay close to the towns ; and it
would be remarkable if it were other-
wise. Throughout the great rural belts
of India space is so valuable that no man
lives on his farming land, nor is there
room to spare for a tree. Every inch,
right up to the low bank which retains
the water and marks the boundary, is
cropped; and when the day is spent Ab-
dul and Chunda alike, with their families,
converge on the village to roost —taking
with them, incidentally, most of the
weeds they grubbed to improve the even-
ing soup. In and around the village there
will be trees, mangoes mostly, but be-
tween villages the paddy fields are inno-
cent of any green above the grain. Here
you’ll see larks, cattle egrets, odd.storks
by waterholes and, of course, kites; but
it is around the village that the smaller
fowl cluster —mynas and doves, “copper-
smiths” and orioles, bulbuls, sunbirds,
rollers and the übiquitous sparrow, with
a particularly virulent type of crow
which is responsible for the blasphemy
of the village butcher, and kites and vul-
tures to grab what anyone else leaves.
These birds have been adapted to life
amongst humans for so long that the
habits are fixed, and when some mis-
guided fools brought specimens here the
new arrivals sought no farther than the
nearest streets and parks to carry on as
before. Or so I surmise ; if any saw fit
to go bush I devoutly hope the nearest
native —maggie, kooka or butcher-bird —•
promptly fell upbn it and rent it asunder,
and will continue to do so throughout
the ages. All of which applies in general
to sundry other immigrants—unfeathered
—still arriving.

“Blime”; One place where a dog
means nothing and a well-trained horse
everything is in cutting-out cattle. In
our southern Victorian district, where
cutting-out is done at high pressure, the
pony follows the selected beast through
the mob, wheels, twists arid anticipates
its every move until, trying desperately to
escape the volley from the stockwhip, the
beast ends with a rush in the cut-out’
bunch. At least two mounts a day are
necessary, and do those excited little stock
ponies love the job! What beforehand
looks like a dopey little nipt wakes with
a whinny and starts dancing at the pros-
pect. Lending a northern boss a hand, I
found the cutting-out job consisted of
riding quietly into the mob and slowly
working the wanted animal to the out-
side, where he was edged as calmly as
possible towards the opposite bunch. No
noise, no haste, no technique, and any
old mount will do. Explaining its ad-
vantages, the boss pointed out how the
method does not disturb the cattle, knock
up the nags or anyone else. He is used
to that method. He likes it. But give me
a decent pony that knows his job and
let’s get something done.

“Mat’s Mate”; We were tramping
down the lilawarra, broke and anxious
to earn a few bob, when a dairy cocky
out of Dapto offered us a job. “It’s only
for a fortnight,” he warned us. “Me
elder boy’s in bed with ’flu an’ one of
the others has got a sprained wrist.” It
‘ Don't tell the idiot — he's got them on back to front."
was worth 40 bob a week and keep and
we took it on. It wasn’t so bad for the
first couple of days, but then we noticed*
we were being called earlier each morn-
ing until we found ourselves floundering
about in the pre-dawn darkness. “Hey,”
Mat said one morning, gazing sleepily
at the cocky holding his hurricane lamp
by the door, “don’t make it too hot.”
“Aw, surely y’ don’t mind gettin’ up a
bit early,” was the answer. Mat came
fully awake. “We don’t,” he said, “but
we got t’ be careful of our vows.”
“Vows?” “Yair. We belong to the
Gould League of Bird-lovers.” “What’s
that got t’ do with gettin’ up early?”
Mat pulled the blankets around his chin.
“Well, we made a promise not t’ be cruel
t’ birds. Wakin’ the poor sproggies an’
starlin’s up before they’ve had a proper
night’s sleep’s cruelty, ain’t it?” We didn’t
last the fortnight.

“B. A, Ker”: My memory for faces
being what it is, I didn’t know whether
the fellow was working a confidence trick
or merely making a mistake. His name
didn’t help—Bluey Smiths are plentiful
in any Aussie’s life. Then gradually the
mist cleared. I, as, a youth of 17,
was stalking warily along the bank of
a dry creek; somewhere behind me a
younger boy was also doing a bit of
rabbiting—and, to my chagrin, getting as
many bunnies with his shanghai as I
was with my brand-new 410 shotgun.
Suddenly a rabbit bounded out of a
“squat” and raced for the creek. Almost
as soon as the gun touched my shoulder
I pulled the trigger ; a wide spurt of dust
told me that, as usual, I’d shot “where
the target was, not where he is.” In the
same instant I saw the red head above
the bank of the creek —in direct line!
The boy’s cry and the sight of the blood
on the back of his neck haunted me for
weeks'. My relief was only comparable
to his anguish when I found that, the
shot having merely struck him on the
ricochet,-1 was able to pick it out with a
penknife. Back in the present, Bluey
was talking: “Yes, I copped one in the
neck over in the Middle East. When I
was able to take a bit of interest in things
again, the quack asked: ‘What, are they
using shotguns, now?’ and he handed me
a piece of shell and half a dozen grains
of your shot that I must have been carry-
ing around for about twenty-five years! ”
* * • * *
“Echo”: Up around the headwaters of
Bargo River (N.S.W.) from dense bush
I heard a perfect whip-crack. It came
clear and true, with a double crack at
the end. I gave the coachwhip bird full
marks for that effort. Later came a
carillon of beautiful notes, but from a
bird I’d never heard. Pondering on its
origin, as I came away, I heard a rustling
and had a brief glimpse of a lyrebird
running. But why would it manage a
better call than a stockwhip bird? Any-
way a stockwhip in the Bargo bush hasn’t
been heard in years.

“Dusty Gully”: Alec Dooley waved his
hospital bill threateningly under the
secretary’s nose. It didn’t pacify him
when the latter tried to explain that in-
creased expenses more than absorbed the
Government allowance of six-bob a day
to each patient’s account. “It never cost
this much when any of my other kids
was born here. Jack,” Alec growled.
“Anyway, y’ve got no excuse for adding
insult to injury. Y’ve socked me an extra
guinea for use o’ the labor ward. Strike
me roan, y’ know as well as anyone in
the districk that me an’ the missus are
strong for the Country party! ”
“Gravelsnatcher”: In the solitude of
a two-roomed humpy which I share with
a couple of tame goannas and a sample
of every brand of ant in Sou’-Westralia,
I pictured that Riverina bloke (B.
9/4/’47) sitting by that ant-track liquidat-
ing the travellers with a slipper. Through
the smoke haze I saw him, and as he
drifted by I stopped him with the offer
of a contract. There’s a hilly slope be-
hind my humpy, and for a couple of
minutes he squatted there dealing out
death and destruction. I admired his
technique, his patience, his accuracy—
everything except his choice of a seat. At
that I don’t think I could have bettered
it much. There isn’t a square foot of
that slope that doesn’t belong, territori-
ally, to one of the tribe, and it was un-
fortunate that he selected a sergeant ants’
nest. He left before I could explain,
leaving a permanent contract to return to
a locality where a nest of ants can be
wiped out in a mere three hours’ slogg-
ing.
♦ * * *
“Greenhide Bob”: Believe it or not,
there was a time when this was a free
country. In August, 1914, we had just
delivered a mob of 17,000 wethers off the
shears from the lower Warrego to the
upper Paroo, and were bound for the Gulf
with Cobb and Co.’s drover to lift a
thousand £ead of steers for Goondiwindi,
when the “heads” reported that the trip
was off, owing to water and grass diffi-
culties. We telephoned to Charleville
for Pegleg’s car to come out for us. We
arrived in Charleville sitting on top of
our saddles and swags, and the first thing
we saw was a two-up game in the main
street in front of the police station. We
pulled up at Lucy Dalton’s pub and had
a look at the game out in front. The
bloke holding the kip, ready to spin ’em,
was a mounted police trooper in full
uniform, spurs and all. Nobody seemed
to think there was anything wrong with
that. We had come in to enlist, and this
convinced us that we were doing the right
thing. Later we saw the same trooper
headin’ ’em in Shrapnel Gully, and he
had a belt full of sovereigns, and the
same spurs in his kitbag.
* * * *
“Bo”: The new hand, who had assured
the cocky that he “knew all about horses,”
was told to take the dray across the hill
on the other side of the creek and load
up some fence-posts that had been cut.
There was about a foot of water in the
creek, and when it got to the edge the
neddy jibbed at going across. The new
hand got down and expostulated fiercely
with the stubborn moke. When expostu-
lation proved of no avail, he pulled his
boots and socks off, rolled up his strides,
said “Watch me! ” to the prad and, imitat-
ing a quadruped hauling a load, he forded
the creek. Repeating the performance on
the way back, he went up to the neddy,
tapped him on the nose and said, “See
how easy it is, y’ silly-lookin’ blankard?”
Then, stepping back to give his charge
plenty of room, he went on, “Now I want
y ’ to do exactly what I did. Giddap! ”
* * * *
“Esk D.”: I came upon George grub-
bing in a shallow hole in barren sand-
stone near his hut. “How’s she pannin’
out?” I inquired with a grin. “Aw, I
dunno,” the old chap replied. ‘‘ ’Tain’t
that a bloke’d find anything much here.
It’s orf the schist belt that carries the
gold reefs, an’ there’s no hope o’ gettin’
stone worth workin’. If I struck another
cove doin’ this I’d reckon he was batty.”
“Well, why are y’ doing it?” I asked.
George straightened his back carefully
before replying. “Well, y’ see, it’s more
convenient f’r me t’ work here when me
‘screws’ is bad, instead o’ climbin’ up the
spurs t’ the likely country. ’Tain’t half
so bad fossickin’ a bit here, ’cause then
I don’t feel so bad about wastin’ me time
loafin’ in the hut.”
“Hanko”: Tell “Ceg” (B. 23/4/’47)
there’s no need for us to introduce “some
of those hawks which did such good
scavenging work around the military
camps in Egypt.” Kitehawks are no
strangers to Australia, and probably quite
a number of those that fly our skies have,
on occasion, strutted in Abdin Square
and even in the tortuous Sharia el
Waassaa. Then why don’t they alight
and tramp about in, say, Martin-place?
Ah, that’s a good one. Let’s ask the
council?

“C.E.”: Nick brought his dog with
him when he moved south and settled in
the hill country. An ordinary enough
looking mong, but Nick was eager in his
offer to lay anything from his boots to
his last ounce of flake-cut on the sheep
worker. Sam listened for a bit, then
reckoned he knew a good clear place
where the dog couldn’t muster the sheep
in sight. Leading the way he pointed
out the gully, and the sheep feeding in
groups low on the far spur. Nick gave
a snort of derision, spoke to the dog,
and watched while he dashed towards
the woollies. Not able to see far, the
dog was bringing the first bunch when
Nick halted him. “Back, Mug,” he called.
“Back. Aw, blast y’, back there.” The
dog halted, puzzled, then darted towards
him. “No. Back!” bawled Nick. “Aw,
go ’way there.” Again the dog stared
at the hill behind, and, turning, made
towards Nick, who raved, waved his
arms and cursed. “Come behind, then, y’
silly cow,” bellowed Nick. “Behind, I
said. Behind.” The dog turned and
trotted in the opposite direction. Holding
his sides delightedly, Sam at length in-
tervened. “Better go up an’ get him
afore y’ bust,” he advised Nick. “It
ain’t y’r dog’s fault, it’s the bloke up the
hill there. An’, cripes, it ain’t much use
y’ tryin’ t’ get the last word with that
there echo!”

“Emjai”; References from time to
time to the appearance of the Argentine
ant in Victoria suggest that it is a
comparatively recent immigrant. But
about 50 years ago in northern Victoria
I saw devastation wrought in a large
aviary of canaries by swarms of slow-
moving tiny brown ants which must have
been those S. American vandals. All eggs
had been bored into and eaten out;
young birds in the nests killed ; fledglings
attacked on the perches so that few sur-
vived, and myriads of the ants, too small
to be noticed from outside, were over
all. There immediately followed an in-
vasion of the big, mild-mannered black-
and-gold sugar ants. At first they were
accused of being allies in crime, but a
verdict of non-proven was recorded when
by next day the midget horde had been
either mopped up or driven off, and no
trace of them was seen in the vicinity
again. Maybe the chap with the pen-
chant for hara-kiri in the honey-jar rates
for a medal as a suppressor of the Argen-
tine horror. Any other observations to
confirm the award?
THE GHOST.
We heard you singing along the road
When dawn was still and there was no sing-
ing— , ,
Your ghost-song bore us where peace abode
In a glade where bell-birds’ chimes were ring-

We saw the shadow along the track
When the sun was high and there were no
shadows.
We called your name to bring you back,
But you fled away over wild bush meadows.
We saw your eyes ’mid the b'ush-stars gleaming;
We felt you near in the wind’s warm breath
If life is a dream we all are dreaming,
Who can answer “What is death?”
The wild hawks said, “We saw her going,”
The wagtails chattered, “We saw her come,
When the morning wind was gently blowing
The dews away from her b'ushland home.”
The wild things know her; they’re always near
her;
The white staraksignal a message kind,
“Wait in the dusk and you’ll maybe hear her,
Singing away on the fiver wind.”

“Jona”; I don’t know anything about
the scientific side of water-divining, but
I was an eyewitness to this test. Bill
was for it and Tom against, so they
arranged a demonstration for our benefit.
Bill was blindfolded and led over the
ground, and whenever the stick dipped
Tom drove a white peg into the earth
signifying the presence of water. Every
so often he would say “Any here?”
and when the response was in the negative
he would drive in a black peg. He led
the dowser round for about 10 minutes,
with the final result that in nearly every
case a black and a white peg were driven
in side by side.

“Hanko”: Someone said something
somewhen about the futility of chasing
a will-o’-wisp, and he was right, for
that tantalising luminosity won’t tarry
for a close-up inspection. I know, for
I once tried to stalk one of the things.
When I’d sneaked within 100yds. of it
the wisp vanished, but on my retreating
a few steps the bluish light would return
and dance breast-high over the gilgais.
Try as I would I couldn’t come up with
it, so, with my bunions a-throb, I
limped back to our fettlers’ camp. That
will-o’-wisp’s address? About a mile
west of Wilbriggie siding. Hay fine,

“Flathead”: I have often watched
Wirth’s elephants exercising, walking in
file and lovingly clasping each other’s
tails with their trunks, but I did not
realise the noble, one-for-all side of the
pachyderms’ character until I read of
what some elephants have done in
Sweden. They belonged to a German-
owned circus, and recently the .Swedish
Government ordered them to be auctioned
as alien property. Their trainer set them
free in the town streets, where they staged
a stampede worthy of a Tarzan film,
terrifying inhabitants, pushing lamp-posts
down and sitting on small cars. When
they were eventually rounded up the
trainer gave the explanation for his
“strike.” “Sweden is making a great mis-
take,” he said. “Those elephants love
each other. If they are parted, they will
die,”

“The Old Chook”: A few years ago
analysis of water for supply
showed that its contained salts could not
have come only from the ground it
flowed over. It contained also the salts
of sea-water in their right proportions,
the chief, of course, being common salt.
This led to analysis of rain-water at many
parts; everywhere salt was present; the
nearer the sea the higher the salt per-
centage. So it was established that rain
is not only condensed vapor, but also to
some extent fine spray. As the rain-
water after reaching the ground flows on-
ward the salt is naturally concentrated by
evaporation, and when the water reaches
dead-end lakes it concentrates still more,
and without an occasional washout these
become as salt as the sea, or more so.
1 don’t know how much salt a sheep re-
quires daily to keep in health, but evi-
dently “Betcha’s” friends’ sheep in E.
Gippsland (B. 16/4/’47) get enough in
heir drinking water.

“Spinifex”: The recent death of a Mur-
ivillumbah (N.S.W.) farmer after he had
seen bitten by a death-adder brought
'orth the statement in a Sydney news-
paper that the deadliness of the death-
idder is due to its large fangs. Actually,
t is due more to the fact that the adder
s viperine, i.e., its fangs are tubes through
vhich the venom is injected. Most other
Australian snakes are colubrine, their
: angs having only deep grooves along
which the poison is convened. With the
latter type much of the venom is lost if
the snake strikes through material of any
kind; and in any case not all of it is
conveyed to the extreme .tip of the fangs.
With the viperine snake all the venom is
expelled from the fangs at the deepest
point of penetration, where scarifying or
Suction is of little avail. When the
writer was bitten by a brown snake in
Queensland about four years ago an
A.M.C. corporal put a hypodermic
syringe to good use, after ligatures had
been applied. Inserting the needle near
the punctures, with the syringe empty
“Cot a puncture outfit, Ali’
and the plunger home, he drew the
plunger back, filling the syringe with
blood, and repeated the performance
several times, with satisfactory results.
Where a syringe is available swift action
on these lines should prove far more
effective than either scarifying or sucking
the wound, and the method might be
worthy of adoption as part of the
standard treatment for snakebite.^
“Exkewex”: “B. A. Ker” (B. 9/4/’47)
on “wind-suckers” covers the ground
fairly well but he misses one point. When
stabled, their favorite tooth grip is the
top of the lower half of the door, and
apart from the gradual disappearance
of the door, this leads to the neddy swal-
lowing a lot of splinters, with bad effects
on his digestive economy. It appears to
be purely a male habit; though I’ve
seen both geldings and stallions amusing
themselves at it, I can’t recall a wind-
sucking mare.

“Chuck”: The paddock across the
river hadn’t been trapped for years. Con-
templating the number of rabbits that
swarmed down to feed on the flats each
evening, Mike anticipated a good catch.
Starting about sundown, he began setting
his traps, but no sooner was he out of
sight over the ridge than a squeal came
from back along the line. He collected
“You can stop deputising now, Joe — I've got the whistle going again!”
the bunny, and returned to the job. Pre-
sently there was another rattle from over
the ridge, followed by a squeal from
further down. Deciding the noise would
put the wind up the remainder, Mike
again went back to collect. During the
next hour he traversed the line so many
times he got few more traps set. It was
getting late, and dropping a couple more
on the already generous pile, he squatted
for the next set, when again a sudden
outburst indicated a victim. With a snort
of exasperation, Mike climbed a stump
and coo-eed down the river to Bill. “F’r
Pete’s sake, scoot up ’n’ down there ’n’
keep the flamin’ rabbits back, will y’?”
he implored, when Bill appeared. “It’s
gettin’ dark, ’n’ a man’ll never git a
decent catch if he can’t even finish settin’
his traps!”

“Blue Boy”: Mrs. Mellow had the pub
at The Dip, One day when a fair crowd
was in and nobody was spending much
she yelled at the singers “Shut up! Ye’re
too damn mean to shout. Ye want to sing
yerselves silly, and I don’t have it in my
bar.” A few days later a stranger
came along humping his bluey. He
silenced the others when he sang, “One
Day When We Were Young,” which
brought tears to the eyes of the hotel-
keeper. “A cove that can sing like that
deserves champagne,” she said, and got a
bottle of fizz down. Then she said to
the swaggie, “Ten’s yer hat, Ginge.” When
the amazed Ginger handed her his hat she
put a quid in it and said, “Now pass it
round. You coves have got to pay for
yer music today.” The swing of the hat
realised three pounds, for which the as-
tonished singer sang “It Happened In
Monterey.” Since then nobody’s been
game to sing in Mrs. Mellow’s bar.

“Zake”: Strolling along the river I
came upon a tired-looking man who after
much stretching and yawning got to his
feet and began hauling in a rope tied to
a log on the bank. Shortly up from the
depths came a contraption from which
the owner helped himself to about half
a dozen good-sized fresh-water crabs.
His trap was an iron hoop, evidently off
a cask, hanging from which was a short-
ened cornsack, in which were bits of
rabbit carcass. Over the hoop was
fashioned a rough handle, to which was
attached the hauling rope. He assured
me it was better than “all y’r fancy ways
o’ catchin’ crabs,” and the best part
about it was it worke3 for you while you
snoozed. After tossing another few bits
of rabbit in the bag and lowering it in
the water again, the crab-catcher, who
seemed to find fishing a devil of a back-
breaking job, sank back again to slumber,

“Exkewex”: Apparently “The 0.D.”
(B. 30/4/’47) believes that Australia
ceases somewhere below the Tropic of
Capricorn, as witness his statement that
the sun is always in the north in this
country. Actually, anywhere north of
Rockhampton the sun can get to the south
at midsummer —and there is quite a lot
of Australia further north than “Rocky.”
As for his bushman who always knows
the points of the compass day and night
—has he ever been on a blacked-out ship
which is steering a zig-zag course and on
which he has no access to bridge or
chart-room? If he says he has never
been “slewed” under such circumstances,
he is a blood brother to Ananias, yet
messing around in a big featureless pad-
dock on a still foggy night is just about
an analogous case. Most bushmen who
are wonders in rough, heavily-timbered
country are duffers in open grass plains,
and vice versa.
* * * *
“Narrin”: “D.R.H.” (B. 16/4/’47)
should have added that the centipede-
like camouflage of the banded skink is
of protective value mainly to youngsters
of the tribe —adults are too large to be
mistaken for centipedes. Also, Hfnulia
fasciolata is about the strongest and
slipperiest animal for his size that I
know. It’s almost impossible to hold
a fully-grown specimen in your bare
hand without crushing it. The scales are
so smooth and so beautifully polished
that there is no friction and the lizard
writhes madly with all his very muscular
body until he escapes. When he does so,
if there is no hole handy, he’ll most
likely turn and look at you with flicker-
ing tongue and a bold expression that
makes you thankful he’s eight or nine
inches long instead of as many feet. As
for his 1.Q., the late Edgar Waite reported
a captive specimen that, having caught
a moth too large to be handled, took
the insect to a water dish and drowned
it. I have a half-grown banded skink
which learned in 10 minutes that the lift-
ing of the side of his cage meant the in-
sertion of food ; since then he comes to
investigate as soon as the glass is touched,
and will take a live moth from the
crucible tongs I use to shove such tucker
into the cage. His hunting behavior, too,
is varied. When white-ants are given
him he will, jf hungry, wade in and
snap up everything in sight for a minute
or two. When not so hungry he merely
stalks the insects from behind stones and
pieces of bark as if they were large and
dangerous animals. I’ve seen him creep
cautiously up to a termite, touch it gin-
gerly with his nose and then spring back
in pretended alarm,

“Betcha”: Bunging into clink all whose
ideas on soil erosion differ from his own
(B. 16/4/’47) might bring a heap of satis-
faction to a certain type of fellow, but
it sounds like shutting the team in the
stable so we can get the plowing done.
Trees do the job of holding stream banks
and wash-outs, but as the contention is
surface soil, I’d like to know how tree
roots, many feet underground, preserve
the top layer. Granted that on occa-
sion trees may prevent a minor landslide,
but for surface conservation the solution,
where it will grow, is a carpet of
perennial grasses. Grass won’t grow
satisfactorily under trees, and the scanty
patches that try burn off in the first dry
spell, leaving the dry powdery surface
beneath easy prey to wind and rain. Per-
haps “Atrax” will explain how it hap-
pens that in certain localities the surface
beneath his sure cure for erosion has
steadily disappeared over the years till
the trees stand grotesquely propped on
several feet of bare, exposed roots. Or
does the poor coot think someone planted
the seed in mid-air?
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: Correct, “Zake,” those
caterpillars are not on the menu of
world-wise magpies, but it is not because
of their noisome odor (B. 23/4/’47). The
grub was obviously of the species known
as processional caterpillar, “hairy Jack”
or “itchy grub.” All three names are
apt. The first derives from the column-
of-route adopted by the caterpillars when
travelling in company; head to tail in
single file the unbroken line appears at
first glance to be a thin snake. “Hairy
Jack,” of course, comes from the hirsute
body of the crawler. And “itchy grub”
is born of cruel experience. It provides
the explanation of that young magpie’s
repugnance. By some means that I have
never been able to locate, the caterpillar
exudes an irritant that will raise white
lumps on the human skin, lumps that itch
maddeningly for hours. This irritating
agent is not held in fesefve and emitted
only when defence is necessary; it is
left behind on everything crawled over
by the grub. A shirt so contaminated
would carry enough invisible irritant to
make the wearer thoroughly miserable
18 to 20 hours after. Where the creature
gets the painful substance from, and why
the supply doesn’t run out with the con-
stant use, I often wonder. But it was
surprising to read that even a young
magpie tried to eat one of the pests.
Meat-ants have a surer instinct than that.
I once saw an itchy grub crawl across an
ant-bed; the voracious myriads weren’t
even mildly interested. I don’t know of
any other creature that would receive
such tolerant treatment.
THE BAMBOOS.
With harsh, metallic rustle the bamboo trees
Disturb the harmony of autumn air;
They sigh in despair for glowing days ot
summer
And wheeze a little in their throats some-
where.
Sometimes the wash of rambling waters sounds
In their fluted hearts, or the strange disturbing
song
Of tropic places, or the mystic rush
Of sandalled feet in an oriental throng.
Elusive starlings splash in the billowing breeze
Among the lapping leaves and crazy branches,
And currents of -jyinds and autumn noises pause
And tumble down in musical avalanches.
In summer days the bamboos dreamed in the
park,
Drawing the sun’s light through their inti-
mate vines
And closing on its warmth; but autumn sends
The first cold quivers ringing down their
spines. -
They rub' their knotted knuckles like gaunt old
men
Shivering beside a dying winter fire;
Their agitated stems unbend and bend —
The shrill wind fingers an unwilling lyre.
They are lonely now in the evening, for all the
children
Have played deserter, left them for home and
hearth;
And darker it grows as, trembling, the bamboos
whimper,
Clinging for comfort to the eternal earth.
QUEENSLAND.

Fleece Improvement.
“Murrawong”: When classing the
breeders for flock improvement (B.
7/5/’47) the fleece must be watched, and
the owner should aim at stabilising a cer-
tain type. If the objective is a medium
wool, a range of 58s to 80s must be
shortened up. Retain the 60s provided
they are good, but anything over 70s is
out of place. Discard doggy wools,
starey wools, and those with excessive
color, if the percentage will stand it.
Important points are length of staple all
over the fleece, evenness of quality,
density and handle. All are subject to
influence by the season, by sickness (fly-
strike and worm infestation) or by the
strain of rearing a lamb, and suitable
allowance should be made. A certain
minimum length of staple on the shoulder
for the period should be set, however,
and all short-woolled sheep put out.
Similarly, a fleece that is full-warp on the
shoulder and barely half-warp behind
will spoil the look of any line of wool.
Too wide a range of qualities is bad ;
70s on the shoulder running off to 60s
on the rump may be handled by a sorter,
but a woolclasser hasn’t the time or
the facilities to do it. Density and
handle call for more classing experience
than anything else. The tyro is liable to
be led astray by condition in the wool
and also by stiff, harsh-fibred wools. A
good wool should be soft and yet must
fill the hand. It must have body ; un-
fortunately this is often confused, par-
ticularly in rams, with harshness. A
dense-woolled sheep has its wool-growing
area carrying the maximum number of
fibres ; it is usually a well-grown wool
and by reason of its denseness dust and
weathering have not penetrated the staple
to any great degree. Density and style
go largely along with well-defined crimp
and good staple formation. These com-
prise the hallmark of good wool and are
the things to aim at.
Beef Fattening.
“Agric”; In readiness for. the time
when they will again have to meet com-
petition on the overseas meat market,
Queensland beef cattlemen are giving
serious consideration to the economics of
topping-off with concentrates or by crop
fattening. Dr. Montgomery White, Agri-
cultural Chemist, Department of Agricul-
ture and Stock, has for years been in-
terested in cattle fattening from the
scientific point of view, and in an ad-
dress on “Corn Fattening of Grazing
Animals,” stressed that when consider-
ing this question cattlemen had to bear
in mind (1) the class of property; (2)
the age and breed of the animals; (3)
their condition at the beginning of the
fattening period ; and (4) the price they
were going to receive for the topped-off
beasts. In young animals one of the first
requirements was the production of bone
and flesh to provide a sound foundation.
For every 11b. of dry flesh an animal put
on it also put on from 31b. to 41b.
of water. When the water was being
deposited it was put in with the proteins
in the flesh, and it could be taken out
independently without interfering with
the flesh.
Tests at meatworks had revealed that
after a long train journey, if cattle were
kept at the works for about five days,
it was possible to put back 80 p.c. of the
water they had lost by wastage on the
journey. When a beast was producing
fat it required 41b. of starch for every
11b. of fat it produced. This fat did not
waste very rapidly but was stored for
“Got a new creation for Dolly?"
use in time of necessity. Irrespective of
the age of a beast, it required about 51b.
of maize to put op 11b. of fat, a gain of
21b. per day was easy to put on, and in
America it was quite common to give
animals 141 b. of corn per day, but in Aus-
tralia it would not pay to feed so heavily.
From a financial point of view, it was
hazardous under Queensland conditions
to feed grown cattle, because while put-
ting on lib. of fat for every 41b. of
starch or 51b. of corn, they were being
deprived of 51b. or more of dried pasture,
and if that pasture were good its value
would not be far below that of the corn.
Summing up, Dr. White said the feed-
ing of concentrates to natural-pasture
fattening cattle could be successful under
conditions only when (a)
concentrates were cheap and a premium
was paid for choice cattle; ( b ) cattle
were not called upon for an undue ex-
penditure of energy, either in walking to
water or in gathering their food ; and (c)
when satisfactory control of parasites
was ensured. An infestation of 2000
ticks —some cattle had been observed to
drop 8000 per day—meant, in terms of
blood, the loss to an animal in its life-
time of the equivalent of more than a
bag of linseed meal.
Navy Beans in N.Q.
“Gip”; In northern N.S.W. navy beans
for canning were a good thing during the
war years. In various parts of Queens-
land they are becoming popular as a
rotational crop with peanuts, maize, etc.
N.Q. farmers growing cowpeas for seed
find navy beans a close competitor
momentarily, and they resemble the
former crop in many ways. Usual sow-
ing time is mid-January, with harvesting
in April. Michelite, which matures in
12 weeks, is most popular; it produces
a heavy crop of medium-sized, well-filled
pods, very suitable for canning.
All medium rich soil suits these beans,
from light sandy loam to red soil. No
fertilisers are required and tne same pre-
paration of the soil as for cowpeas or
peanuts is suitable. Row spacings should
be 3ft., with the plants 3in. apart in the
rows, at the rate of 121 b. of seed per
acre. Maize planters will do the job.
The beans are harvested by hand when
they reach the dry, brittle stage. For
shelling, cowpea-shellers serve the pur-
pose. The old pods are valuable as stock
feed.
For large areas, such as those in the
Burnett and Kingaroy districts, bean-
cutters fitted to a tractor are used to lift
two rows of plants into a single windrow.
The beans are then thrashed out by, a
modified header-harvester, available to
farmers on contract. Average yield is
12 bushels to the acre ; under favorable
seasonal conditions, up to 16.
Mechanical Land Clearing.
“Atlanta”: Revolutionary changes in
land clearing have been introduced to the
Gosford district (N.S.W.), where in the
past, two years a bulldozer and ripper
have cleared well over 1000 acres of
virgin forest for orchard planting. A
113-h.p. bulldozer and a ripper
have dealt with trees reaching a height
of 50ft. to 60ft. and having a trunk
diameter of 2ft. 6in. to 3ft.
In the first operation a 300 ft. long
steel rope is anchored to one of the
largest and strongest trees. The other end
is fastened to drawbar of the bulldozer,
which then moves in a circle, having the
rope as its radius and the anchor tree as
its centre. All trees to medium size are
readily pulled over, and for larger trees
better leverage is obtained by pushing the
rope up the trunk with a forked stick.
Gelignite is exploded in the soil at the
base of obstinate trees, which are then
pushed over by the bulldozer.
The bulldozer is also effective for push-
ing over trees where a rope has not been
used, and for trees which do not yield
readily extra leverage is obtained by rais-
ing the blade of the dozer and applying
force higher up the trunk. This is accom-
plished by first using the blade as a
scoop, heaping the soil close to the tree,
and then climbing this mound with the
machine.
The heavy 13ft.-wide blade pushes all
uprooted timber to the sides of the area
being cleared and stacks it ready for
burning. After clearing, a ripper is
hitched behind the dqzer to tear out
roots and stumps. Three massive tynes,
3ft. long, 4in. wide at the bottom and
spaced 3ft. apart, are raised or lowered
by a winch on the dozer. All roots,
stumps and boulders from a depth of
about 3ft, are brought to the surface by
a double ripping, once in each direction.
Roots and stumps are then gathered into
heaps for burning.
Contractors with this type of fequip-
ment work on an hourly or an acreage
basis. Costs per acre range from £25 to
£4O, depending on nature of country and
amount of timber to be removed. The
usual contract rate per hour is £3. Much
country at present being cleared mechani-
cally could not readily be brought under
cultivation by any other method, while
an additional advantage is that land thus
cleared can be brought into production
without delay.
Winter Feeding.
“Billjim”: In winter cows should have
all the good hay they will eat twice a
day. More nutrients are absorbed when
silage or rodts go with the hay than when
hay is fed alone, if the hay is of medium
or poor quality. However, if the hay is
of the best quality and there is plenty of
it silage is unnecessary. But there is
seldom enough good hay, hence the silo
is the cheapest, surest and most satisfac-
tory way of providing supplementary feed
for winter. Amount of silage to be fed
ranges from about 201 b. per cow per day.
to 501 b., according to the size of the cow
and the quantity of roughage it gets. If
hay is scarce or dear it can be eked out
with silage.
Root crops are low in fibre, and should
be fed, like silage, as a supplement to a
ration of hay and concentrates. The
quantity of roots to feed depends upon

their cost as compared with that of other
feeds, upon the kind of roots and upon
the ingredients in the ration. Generally,
cows on pasture or silage do not need
root crops. If root crops are expensive
feed only about 301 b. to 501 b. per day ;
if cheap twice the quantity may be used.
More mangels and turnips than sugar-
beets or sweet potatoes because they
contain more water. Give only moderate
quantities of beet tops because they are
laxative. Tops as well as roots should be
freed from excessive dirt.
Frequently the grain needs of high-
producing cows are so great that the
necessary quantity cannot be given with-
out endangering their health. In such
cases the quantity may be kept at a safe
level and additional nutrients supplied by
feeding beet pulp either dry or soaked in
about three times its weight of water.
The farmer should be guided largely by
the condition of the individual cows. If
any are getting thin give them more
grain ; if they are getting fat reduce the
grain.
Hints for the Farm.
“W. Court”; Pigs can pick up t.b.
when allowed to run in paddocks used
for pasturing cattle. The germ passes
out of dairy-cattle carriers and is picked
up by the pigs as they root up the ground
around dung heaps. When t.b. invades
the piggery the entire herd may fall vic-
tims before it is realised there is any-
thing wrong. However, it is not likely
to appear amongst pigs that are (a) kept
away from ground contaminated by -cattle
manure, (b) well fed and quartered, and
(c) not allowed to mix with newly-pur-
chased pig S un tii a t least one month has
passed,
“H.W.U.”: When sowing lucerne or
other grass seeds either mixed with the
super or through a grass-seed box attach-
ment on the combine, measure out the
seed in four or more separate bags when
the exact rate of sowing for a given
attachment is not known. This will give
a more even coverage over the whole
paddock. For example, if 100 acres are
to be sown at the rate of 21b. per acre,
measure four lots of 501 b. and when 25
acres are covered and 501 b. is used
the rate of sowing will be about correct.
“Sarina”: When it’s hard to get the
spout of the oilcan into an almost in-
accessible oil-hole take a length of fine
wire, as long as necessary, and push one
end into the oil-hole and the other end
into the spout of the oilcan. When the
oilcan is squeezed a slow streatn of
oil flows down the wire and straight
into the hole. Not a drop is lost, and that
which is used penetrates efficiently.
“Bumble”: When beehives are of the
one color and conformity and placed
fairly close there is generally a fair drift
of workers and the strongest colonies
gain at the expense of others. Similarly,
newly-mated queens often mistake their
domicile on returning from the nuptial
flight and the resultant queenless state of
a hive may pass unnoticed till the colony
has dwindled. Unless queen-mating hives
are manipulated at a spot removed from
the apiary if will be difficult to get the
full quota of young queens laying.
Special identifying features, such as color
variation or boards or bags to mark parti-
cular hives, will help to get better re-
sults when queen cells are hatching.
“Bi”; To remove putty from a win-
dow-frame the chisel or knife should be
heated at intervals while the dry putty
is being removed.
“Calo”: Bordeaux mixture will settle
snails, but they sometimes escape by
bunching themselves in their excavations
in rosebush stems, under logs and bricks,
etc., and after spraying collection by
lantern or torchlight is the best plan.
Baits made of lib. of bran to which loz.
of calcium arsenate has been added can
be placed under cabbage leaves or other
cover, but should be removed before the
birds are about in the morning.
“Chook”: The secret of success in
poultry-farming, apart from following
commonsense rules, lies in plenty of
green feed to supplement laying mash and
grain. When prices are normal it costs
approximately 2s. per 100 per day to feed
hens. Given chaffed green feed, the feed-
ing costs are reduced up to 40 p.c. In
addition it also increases production. It
doesn’t actually make the hens lay more
eggs, but puts them in better health and
no bird can produce to capacity without
good health.
“Calos”: What appears to be a rheu-
matic condition in a young heifer will
sometimes disappear if she is carefully
rugged or housed during frosty or rough
weather. An extra allowance of bran
and plenty of salt lick is recommended,
as well as an hour or two in the lucerne
patch each day. Young cornstalks, sorg-
hum, pea and bean trash as well as fresh
pickings from the garden are valuable.
Leaves of cabbage, cauliflower, spinach,
etc., should never be wasted. Milk may
be given, either in food or otherwise, and
bone meal is sometimes necessary to
effect a cure. The stiffness of the limbs
denotes some deficiency in feeding, and
extra nourishment and warmth will help.
“Adelaide”; The 90-mile “Desert” on
the S.A. border to Victoria has of late
been cultivated a lot, in spots, and so is
generally known as the 90-mile mallee
scrub. The less desirable parts get a big
boost from Becker, who experiments
in the middle of it with perennial veldt
grass got from South Africa by the
C.S.I.R. for use in “sandy rises and flats
covered with heath and low mallee.”
This immigrant gave difficulties at first
in ripening and harvesting; but these
have been mastered, and now a lot of
land formerly worthless carries about
five sheep to 10 acres.

which, the p.-0.-w. pay was credited to
them, Antonio shook his head in-
comprehendingly, but stuck to his point.
“Mistair Laci speak; ‘Prigionaire
sempre work, no money, prigionaire
plenti stupid,’ ”
“Mr. Lacey bad man,” said Krantz,
very feelingly, “no speak true. You work
good ; you money.”
He knew it was likely to be ruinous to
proper discipline, but he put his hand in
his pocket and pulled out a two-shilling
piece. He pqinte’d to the stack of fin-
ished posts.
“Two hundred posts. Two shillings
for Antonio.” He gave him the florin,
“Ancora two hundred posts ; ancora two
shillings.”
“Quanti lire?” he asked.
Krantz had an idea that with Italy
overrun by the Allied armies the lire’s
value would be very low.
“One hundred,” he said.
Antonio’s eyes lit up with pleasure ; he
probably had never heard of fluctuating
exchange rates. “Grazia,” he said grate-
fully.
He picked up the mallet and burst the
log he had labored on so long with a
single hit.
That night there was a great noise in
the Italians’ room. Guiseppe’s high
tenor poured out in a virulent stream,
and Antonio’s curt bass snarled in reply.
Krantz hovered outside the door, wonder-
ing if he should intervene, and how. After
about an hour of it Guiseppe came out
at a trot, head down and muttering. He
nearly ran into Krantz. He stopped and
fixed his eyes on him accusingly.
“Ah, Mistair,” he said, without any of
his polite modulations. “You unnerstan
me plenti work ; you unnerstan me plenti
cook. Me cookus Sabato, me cookus
Sunday, no repose, sempre work, sempre
cook. Ma you dato Antonio money. No
datami money.”
Krantz immediately put his hand in his
pocket, realising that he had made a
grievous departure from his measured
policy of equal favoritism. But Gui-
seppe put up his hand protestingly.
“No posseebile money similar Antonio.
Troppo insultare.”
Krantz discovered, however, that there
was no insult in offering him more than
Antonio,
PHE next day Antonio was in a bad
I mood. He wanted to know if Krantz
could buy him a green pullover for his
two shillings, and when he found it wasn’t
enough he seemed to think Krantz had
been cheating him. Krantz smoothed him
down by offering to let him set some
rabbit traps after he had finished his day’s
work.
“Plenti money skin rabbit,” he said.
Next morning Krantz gave Antonio an
old blunt table-knife to skin his rabbits.
Antonio worked it into an effective instru-
ment on the grindstone and come in to
breakfast wearing it in an improvised
sheath in his belt. Guiseppe’s eyes
popped out when he saw it, and he in-
dicated to Krantz by a small secret ges-
ture that he had made a grievous error.
That day Guiseppe was allowed to go
for the mail again. When he returned
he was even more enthralled by the “bella
donna.”
“Oggi me speak donna. Donna un-
nerstan me ; me unnerstan plenti donna.
O donna good, donna good.”
He kept smiling to himself and break-
ing into ecstatic mutterings. Antonio
watched him with intense interest.
On the morning of the next mail day
Antonio did not go off to work as usual.
He waited outside his hut for Krantz, with
a very obstinate and determined look on
his face.
“Oggi me go post office,” he said.
Krantz let him go in the interests of
equality and peace. He jumped on the
bicycle and shot off like a rocket; Gui-
seppe watching him with a stricken look
on his face. It was not long before they
saw him coming home again, behaving in
a most peculiar manner. He would peddle
along furiously, then suddenly turn a
couple of close loops. His hat fell off
in one of the turns and he swooped at it
again and again, trying to pick it up with-
out getting off.
When he arrived home his smouldering
eyes were glowing. He said nothing, but
he looked Guiseppe over in a new way,
calculating, but in no way dismayed.
There was another row in the Italians’
room that night. Not as loud or long as
the previous one, but next morning at
the breakfast table there was an atmos-
phere of tension and an ominous silence.
It didn’t take Krantz long to realise that
the two men were “not speaking” to each
other.
Out in the paddock it was worse. An-
tonio got the saw, but Guiseppe would
not take the other end until Krantz had
ordered him twice very sharply. Then
he gave it such a jerk that Antonio lost
his balance and hit his head on the tree.
Antonio jerked it back, but Guiseppe
jammed it. They kept that up, jerking,
jamming and glaring at each other.
Suddenly Antonio let his end go, and
Guiseppe pulled the saw on top of him-
self, cutting his leg. He sprang up again
with a vicious “Porca Madonna” ; An-
tonio replied with an even more savage
“Porca Dio.” They threw “Maledizioni”
at each other at a furious rate, until
Krantz intervened.
Krantz sent Guiseppe home to preserve
the peace. Antonio took the saw and, as
if demonstrating his contempt for Gui-
seppe, showed how he could use it “solo.”
But he insisted that if he did two men’s
work he was to have morte money;
enough money to buy a green pullover,
and he wanted the pullover when Krantz
went to town the next day. Krantz
agreed, though he could see chaos ahead.
ALL that day and the next the Italians
kept up their feud. When they came
near each other Krantz could feel the
waves of their hatred heating the air about
him. Antonio got his green pullover;
Krantz urging him not to let Guiseppe
see it. But Antonio reminded him of
his promise that he could go to the post
office each Friday, and Krantz let him go
although it was late in the evening and
he had already collected his mail.
Antonio put on his new pullover and
rode off in full view of his rival, who
went to his room and sulked instead of
cooking the tea.
As soon as Antonio returned, Gui-
seppe seized the bicycle, and making only
the barest pretence of asking Krantz’s
permission dashed away on it. Antonio
didn’t eat, either. He paced about the
farmyard, staring down the tracks even
after it became dark. Krantz came out
at intervals to stare down the track too.
Antonio would not speak to Krantz
and kept muttering to himself and finger-
ing the knife in his belt. At midnight
Krantz went to bed. Suddenly shouts in
the men’s room set his nerves tingling.
He got up and went out on to his
verandah. There were sounds of running
feet and ominous thumps and crashes
among the sheds. He searched for the
men but could not find them. He
wandered about pursuing the noises
until it suddenly occurred to him
that Antonio might come creeping up
behind him with his knife, thinking he
was Guiseppe. He went to bed again,
but did not sleep.
He heard, or fancied he heard, noises
all night. Stealthy footsteps on the ver-
andah ; scuffling sounds; running feet;
shouts. When he got up at daylight he
was surprised to learn something more
about the Italians; both of his men were
still alive and unharmed. But Guiseppe
looked desperately haggard and jumpy;
Antonio looked savage and frustrated;
he still had a very ominous look in his
eye and wore his knife well to the fore.
Neither, apparently, had gone to bed.
Krantz looked them over and didn’t
need to do much thinking. As |oon as the
exchange opened he put in a call for the
P.W. Control Centre. At the same time
(to save the expense of an additional
call) he left a message at the post office
for Lacey.

BRLAN BUREAU.
A Molongloside Tragedy.
“A trotting mare bred by the Governor-
General, her ears stuffed with cottonwool to
muffle the noise of the crowd, won a race at
Harold Park, Sydney. On the same occasion
‘Labor’ M.L.A. Joe Arthur pledged his ‘Gov-
ernment’ to introduce a Night Trotting Bill
in the first session of the new Parliament.”
There was quite a gala atmosphere at
Yarralumla.
His Magnificence was just back in
residence after having completed an ex-
hausting tour. Necessity for expansion
in his trotter-breeding activities seemed
called for in view of the introduction by
his old pals in Macquarie-street of Night
Trots, playfully known in States which
enjoy this achievement of civilisation as
Red ’Ots.
Of course, the introduction hinged only
on a “Labor” politician’s promise—and
none knew better than His Magnificence
what a frail thing that was. Still, this
was one of those promises the fulfilment
of which could be anticipated with the
greatest confidence. The long-overdue
reform would be good for the people’s
happiness, and even better for His Mag-
nificence’s biz. After he had seen to this
he had toured his other properties to see
how he’d stand when the 40-hour week
brought in by that ass McGirr came into
force. A disappointing feature of his
travels was that he’d been unable to buy
into a single dogfight in any Labor
League.
Here and there on the lawns were
planted open bookmakers’ umbrellas.
Strange-seeming, perhaps, in view of the
weak autumn sunshine. It was just that
they gave the required atmosphere and at
the same time revived for the Vice-King
nostalgic memories of his masterly con-
tribution to the war effort, the
creation of the Sydney Turf Club, whose
getting of 123,250 bricks from the Gov-
ernment yards for Rosehill racecourse
improvements without a permit so de-
lighted every houseless serviceman.
Bunting festooned the grounds, and
several flags, notably the Rugby League’s,
the S.T.C.’s, the Stadium’s and a brewery
house-flag, fluttered in the breeze.
Suddenly the rhythmic sound of racing
trotters as the drivers paced them around
in the spiders was interrupted by the
sound of a horn. Not a hunting horn,
for one doesn’t hunt with trotters. This
was an auto, horn, and it had quite an
aristocratic imperious sound. Immedi-
ately, coming from the garages, appeared
the Rolls Royce. It stopped at the front
door and with that fine socialistic air of
all-men-are-equal that now permeated the
establishment, the chauffeur ‘ sang out
“Hey, Billy, the bus’s ready!”—at which
a sort of groan came from under the
shining black bonnet.
Shortly afterwards His Magnificence
appeared. As one of the landed gentry
—hadn’t he landed a beautifully cushy
job?—it behoved him to wear riding-
breeches and -boots. As a mark of
respect for the politically powerful pro-
fessional football outfit he had pulled on
the red and green guernsey of South
Sydney, his old electorate’s team. A
cravat in the colors of the Redfern Labor
League, a satin-lapelled “soup and fish,”
an admiral’s cocked hat, spats and a riding
crop—though whether this was to flick
trotters on or flies off wasn’t certain —
completed his outfit.
“Where to, Billy?” demanded the
chauffeur, “The Civic Centre, a run down
to the Cotter or to Goulburn again”
“To the stables,” ordered the Vice-
King.
The chauffeur’s eyebrows shot up. Then
he slammed it into first, but before he
could get into top gear they were there.
His Magnificence was received in hail-
fellow-well-met fashion by the newly-
appointed Captain of the Vice-King’s
Trotters. As they were looking around
the stables a Famous Sporting Publican
came out and asked the Turf Secretary
what the “do” was.
“Didn’t you know?” asked the T.S.
“It’s an important investiture.”
“Decorating some Service blokes or
something?” asked the F.S.P. in return.
“Are you kidding?” the T.S. came
back. “Didn’t I say it was an important
one? It’s to present a special ribbon to
that trotter His Magnificence bred—you
know, the one that won the Flyin’ Welter
at ’Arold Park. That mare’s a hero-
whine ! The Lieutenant of the Vice-
King’s Trotters is bringing her up by
float today.”
“But I thought they were tightening up
on petrol ra”
The T.S. looked at him curiously. “Are
you plain dumb today?” he asked.
Suddenly a car shot through the gates,
screamed to a stop and a small horsey-
looking man, diffusing a fine aroma of
the stable, got out. The Vice-King
hurried over,
“Where’s Dead Legs?” he asked
anxiously.
The L. of the V.-K.’s T. twisted his
riding jacket nervously. “She’s conked,
Billy—wriggled out. There’s bin a acci-
dent.”
“What happened?”
“Well, it was like this. One o’ the
blokes was exercisin’ ’er and like a goat
took ’er past Victoria Park racecourse.
Y’ know what sort of a smell’s bin cornin’
from there ever since Nuffield got knocked
back after buyin’ it for a fact’ry site.
Well, Dead Legs starts to snort an’ play
up, and the cove in charge of ’er gits
panicky, takes the cottonwool out of ’er
lugs and bungs it up ’er bugle so she
can’t sniff. Before ’e wakes up to wot
’e’d done Dead Legs sufficated!”

Java
The granting of self-governing rights
to Indonesia reminds me of the time
when, as a member of General Staff In-
telligence, I had to read through trans-
lations of Jap propaganda bfoadcasts. I
was immediately impressed by the large
proportion devoted to Java. There, more
than anywhere else, the Nips concen-
trated on the “Greater East Asia Co-
Prosperity Sphere,” and in no time at all
they were offering ,the natives self-govern-
ment and finding plenty of takers. There
actually was a shadowy sort of puppet
Government with a large proportion of
the present leaders very much to the
fore.
From what I saw of them the Javanese
were no great shakes as fighters, though
many of the educated ones were strong
on politics and speechmaking. The Nips
treated them with a lot more considera-
tion than they did most of the locals in
overrun territories. It is worth remem-
bering that the Japs always claimed that
if they lost this war they would come
again and again until they were eventu-
ally masters of the world. If they have
an ally next time with a ready-made base
in thfe heart of the N.E.I. the invasion of
Australia may become an accomplished
fact. Java alone contains 10 times the
population of Australia. .
With the Republic an established fact
we have to accept it and try to establish
friendly relations. But this must be based
on respect, and to establish that we need
a Government which really governs and
does not leave its foreign policy to a
handful of Communists who are prepared
to support any number of Jap collabora-
tors in any number of insults to our own
nationals and our allies! — Five-by-Two
(Q-).
A Letter from England
It is from my son, who is working with
De Havillands:
“When I first arrived here from Aus-
tralia I felt that I couldn’t get back to
Australia quickly enough. However,
since then my ideas have changed and
that something which seems to happen
to everyone who comes to England has
suddenly made me realise the greatness
and attractions of the country. I don’t
know what it is, and I doubt if many
could explain it in so many words, but
I think the people have something to do
with it.' , Everyone is so friendly and
pleasant and polite. At first it got my
goat, but it’s not that frightfully snobbish
politeness—it’s just natural to the good-
natured, quiet type" of person that one
finds here. There’s something amazing
about these people. They a quiet,
stolid-looking lot, but when a/iimb like
this cold spell crops up one realises the
unity and unselfishness of the country
as a whole.
“You’ve no idea of the difficulties in-
dustry has been up against because of
the cold. But what happened? The coal-
miners worked all one week-end for
nothing. The colliers, tiny ships taking
coal from up north to London, went out
into the North Sea in some of the worst
weather on record. Time and again they
wfere turned back, but most of them got
through in the end. To'save time un-
loading at London, ships unable to obtain
docking space unloaded in midstream into
barges, and volunteers went down to the
docks to speed-up the work. Did the
dockers seize their opportunity for getting
an extra two-bob an hour? No, they
announced that they were going to try
to break the existing record for unloading
ships for a week. They did it,
“One night, three weeks ago, there was
the worst transport hold-up for 30 years,
yet no one was delayed at Piccadilly for
more than half an hour, in spite of trains
freezing-up in tunnels and snow blocking
alHhe lines. Even when the roads were
almost death-traps with buses sliding and
bumping about, the double-deckers ran
as usual. Every now and then a con-
ductor, at the terminus, would say with a
grin on his face that they were on time.
“People over here don’t take pride in
the fact that they put it over someone
else or got something for nothing. Their
main aim is to do their job better than
ever. Even at work the boss can be away
all day and no one makeS the slightest
attempt to slack or loaf. The British
people are extremely honest. If a pas-
senger on the lower-deck of a bus gets
off while the conductor is upstairs, he
pays his fare by giving it to one of the
other passengers.
“When these aircraft factories were
shut down and employees put off, in
many cases tfiey offered to work overtime
free of charge in order to make up for
time lost, and so help the country in its
export drive. It’s no use saying that
Britain’s ‘had’ it—if there’s one person
believes that she will pull through, it is I.
When you go to an exhibition like
‘Britain Can Make It’ or ‘Atomic Age’
it really dawns on you how far ahead of
the rest of the world Britain really is.”—
R. F. O. (N.S.W.).
How Different!
“Pig-iron Bob,” the fools still call him,
forgetting that no opprobrium attaches to
the title. Today it’s a reminder that,
when he was Prime Minister and his
Government decided to permit small con-
signments of scrap—a tiny fraction of
what the U.S.A. was sending—to accom-
pany our wool and wheat to Japan, he
didn’t allow a handful of Commo-led
wharfies„ to say whether the scrap-iron
would be shipped or not.
How different now! In the heart of
Corio (Vic.) electorate and less than five
miles from the home of the Minister for
Post-war Reconstruction can be seen
evidence of what passes for “govern-
ment” in this country under the Chifley
regime. There are rows and rows of
mptor-trucks, almost 500 of them, bought
and paid for by the N.E.I. Out in all
weathers for the last 18 months, the
vehicles are steadily deteriorating, a fact
“ Sandy's lucky—he can play from the inside in Wet Weather.”
that must be obvious to Mr. Dedman
every time his car passes along the road
on his way to Melbourne. But appa-
rently he is unwilling to take action
against his friends on the waterfront.
The time will come when the workers
of Corio will be looking for overseas
trade to keep them in employment. —
M. A. (Vic.).
Our Daily Bread
The Adelaide baking trade celebrated
Anzac Day by decreeing that the heroes
who 'marched and the mobs who admired
should make Thursday morning’s bread
last until Monday.
That appears to bfc the Golden Age
interpretation of the slogan “The greatest
good for the greatest number.” The same
cynical sentiment, if implemented by all
the trades and professions supplying the
things necessary to the body, would en-
sure that a miserable time would be had
by all on every occasion of public re-
joicing. Imagine an extra long week-end
without ice, milk, pfetrol, pubs, doctors,
chemists or transport!
Some callings, by their very nature, are
designed to work while others play. They,
in turn, are able to play while others
work and are granted certain margins and
privileges to offset their “sacrifices,”
When they go a.w.l, they are not being
socialistic but selfish. — Crusty (S.A.).
“Dedman’s Dole”
The R.S.L. in N. S. Wales has been
tardy in taking up the case of the ex-
servicemen trying to qualify as tradesmen
under the Commonwealth Reconstruction
Training Spherne, but there has at least
been a Sydney Town Hall protest meet-
ing. At this State R.S.L, president Bolton
said “The day of idle promises is
finished ; we are not going to put up with
these promises any longer.” His League
has been a long time coming to this de-
termination.
Trainees at Sydney Technical College
work under crude and smellful sanitary
conditions. They have no dining- or
rest-rooms or seats when they eat their
lunch ; not even facilities to make a cup
of tea. Their allowances are niggardly,
and they are handicapped by shortage of
equipment and textbooks, though Army
Ordnance, Engineer and other depots
have idle stocks in plenty. In the result
they are forced to buy, at exorbitant
prices from their deferred pay—if they
have any left —or at the expense of
parents, material that should be issued
free.
And there is a feeling that members of
the administrative staffs, few of whom
saw active service, are unsympathetic.
Trainees consider that the regular tech-
nical college student gets a better deal,
and that they are regarded as a bit of a
nuisance. Over 50 per cfent. of discharged
men Who applied for training on a full-
time basis have been denied it. This at
a time when the building industry needs
every tradesman it can get to reduce the
housing shortage. •
Millions of pounds have been collected
from the public, allegedly to help out dis-
charged men, but thousands of them still
await the training call-up. Public apathy
and Governmental indifference, Com-
monwealth and State, are breeding a
sense of frustration and bitterness that
can be remedied only by a thorough in-
quiry and a ruthless overhaul of the
whole scheme. Instead of being run as
at present on lines of academic pedantry
it should be handed over to experienced
administrators drawn from the fighting
services, who will insist that the ex-
serviceman gets as good a spin as the
wharflumper and other Government pets.
The allowances should be mentioned.
For single men they are £3 ss. a week ;
for childless married men, £4 16s. ; for
man, wife and child, £5 55.; for each
additional child a whole 9s. is granted.
To Mr. Dedman they are “generous.”
He doesn’t have to live on £3 ss. a week
or try to feed, clothe and lodge a child
for nine bob!—T.W. (N.S.W.).
Flax-growing* in W.A.
The outlook for the flax-growing in-
dustry in W.A. is very promising.
Growers feel that the new quality bonus,
the elimination of classification of straw
under 22in. as weed, plus the subsidised
carting over 20 miles, will encourage
farmers to bring this year’s production
up to quota.
Unfortunately, many farmers who
have benefited from war-time flax-
growing have not planted flax this year.
It is up to them to see that the industry
is not allowed to perish—the State has
a future in flax-growing because land
values here are not as high as in the
other flax-growing States.
The industry has already spread to
Muradup and further east approaching
Kojonup, where two farmers have
grown flax successfully. The Kojonup
district is well suited to flax-growing,
particularly when early-maturing varieties
are available in sufficient quantities for
seed.
During the last three years a State crop
competition Ms been held and each year
it has been won by a crop grown in
the Muradup district. The 1945 winner re-
ceived the maximum points available for
straw quality, proving that high-grade
flax can be produced in W.A.
Close to areas already producing flax
there are still thousands of acres of
cleared land suitable for flax-growing.
—J. (W.A.).
An Economic Blessing
“Wusslean” (B. 23/4/’47) argues that a
family will increase with the salary of
the wage-earner, reinforced by Govern-
ment grants to “foster and strengthen
the will to multiply and replenish the
earth.
Single men are already subsidised to
keep an imaginary wife and two children.
Childless couples are paid to keep non-
existent offspring. Single women are
being tempted by high pay to remain
single. Married women are being simi-
larly bribed to remain barren. Wedded
pairs who are both employed and are
childless are being paid to support four
adults and several olive branches. In
other words sterility is at a premium.
Love in a cottage is content to express
itself through natural channels. Love in
a bungalow demands all mod. cons, and
trimmings. The stork has to compete
with the time-payment salesman and
Vanity Fair.
“W.” admits that we are in danger of
being submerged by more prolific races
who have never heard of family sub-
sidies, and who undertake the “cares and
trials” of large families without the aid
of Government “fostering.” We already
have the family standard wage, the bonus,
tax exemptions and free education. What
more do we want? — Pop (S.A.).
Population
‘“R.M.D.” (B. 30/4/’47) has side-
tracked the main subject, which is the
urgent necessity for the whole of Aus-
tralia to be populated. Of course it’s
necessary to speed-up immigration, but
to think in terms of a few thousands to
swell the already crowded metropolitan
centres is simply “tinkering with the
job.”
Millions of people are needed to open
up and populate the vast inland spaces.
Settlement of immigrants in our
capital cities only aggravates living
conditions. Consider the task of
feeding Sydney. Chaotic conditions
must arise at times, and there are
frequent shortages of supplies be-
cause of distribution difficulties. Any
increase of the city population can
only add to housing, transport and
supply problems.
“R.M.D.” seems to think that
country activities are confined to
farming and grazing. Many of our
larger inland towns and cities have
established industries —canning fac-
tories at Bathurst and Leetoq,
machinery factories at Lithgow and
Orange, killing and freezing works
at Bourke and many other minor
industries. These, although they are
only sparse and scattered efforts at
decentralising labor, indicate the
possibilities of the inland areas.
The wider vision involves pre-
arrangement both for sites and in-
dustries. The actual building of new
towns and cities and construction of
water schemes would themselves
provide labor for thousands of
workers. Industrial research should
be carried out to devise fresh in-
dustries. Other nations have had to do it.
America would not be the great nation it
is today had it relied solely on large sea-
board cities.
The population question will never be
settled under the present system of dump-
ing immigrants amongst the “bright
lights,” and it is wasting money to arrange
passages for unsuitable candidates. Our
agents in London should make their selec-
tion for pioneering work. Early settlers
in Australia came through ordeals, and
many made fortunes. What has been
done before can be done again.—C. E. T.
(N.S.W.).
Taxation
For me Mr. Chifley’s “substantial tax
reduction” as from July 1, 1947, works
like this;
Rate of Tax.
Income. P.E. Property.
1945 .. .. £1166 90.40 d. 112.71 d.
1946 .. .. 1071 90.78 d. 109.10 d.
The personal-exertion rate includes
18d, social-services contribution. Even
with the lesser income by £9B, the rate is
actually increased by 0.38 d. on personal-
exertion income, and on the lower income
the property-income rate is reduced by
only a mere 3.16 d.
Alternately with personal-exertion in-
come at £750 and no savings, my tax,
less rebates, would have amounted to
£B9. Income from savings actually
amounted to £317, and my total tax for
the year ended June 30, 1946, is £340.
From income of £317, resulting from 40
years of arduous duties and careful sav-
ing, £251 is virtually confiscated and I am
permitted to retain £66.
From the outset, I was encouraged by
the savings-bank slogan “Save while you
may.” Under this so-called “Labor”
regime the reward for thrift is to be de-
prived of an old-age pension, and to face
“blood and tears and toil and sweat” to
the end. — Applelander (Tas.).


“Harmony”
Some time ago a couple of very in-
teresting experiments were made to
demonstrate the fact that art in music is
very closely allied to that in .painting and
drawing. In the first test the surface of
a drum was coated with a dusting of
graphite. Above this a finely-pointed
pencil was suspended by a very fine
thread with the point just touching the
graphite surface. A Sydney musician
played a sustained note upon a cornet,
causing the pencil to vibrate, and pro-
duced a perfectly symmetrical pattern
upon the graphite surface. Further notes
were sounded in harmony with the
original, and these produced variations
in the pattern which blended into a com-
posite diagram of clear-cut design. The
sounding of a discordant note destroyed
the symmetry of the pattern.
The other test was made with a series
of colored eledtrie-light bulbs, arranged in
order of the spectrum, and wired to the
notes of an organ. When chords were
played in harmony the colors blended
with beautiful effect, but they failed to
harmonise when discordant notes were
played.
As in painting and drawing, music in
its correct form has to be produced in
conformity with set rules embracing
composition, theme, harmony, blending
of tone, atmosphere and balance of sub-
ject. It is not only a question of blend-
ing sounds. Beethoven was deaf when
he composed many of his greatest works.
The grouping together of notes was, to
him, a mental picture of the theme he
wished to convey. Works of this kind
are immortal.
A prominent musician was once asked
why some apparently simple music, such
as Handel’s “Largo,” “Drink To Me
Only With Thine Eyes,” “Sun of My
Soul” (Holley) and many others which
contain only half a dozen or so notes in
the theme, have retained their popularity
for over a century while millions of other
pieces have been forgotten as soon as
their novelty passed. He said that such
lasting music was retained in the minds
of individuals because the harmony
was perfect in every detail, not
only in the tones, but in the “over-
tones.” Each note that is sounded
contains vibrations which blend to-
gether. There is a different blending for
each note. Two notes may sound in
perfect harmony, but their composite
vibrations may not blend in the entire
theme. It is not possible to produce true
musical harmony when discordant notes
are introduced.
Unfortunately there is a tendency in
these times to supersede correct harmony
in music with catchy and jingly airs that
are not music. Records made by the
Andrews sisters, for example, are sung
in trio with adjacent notes —blatantly
ignoring all the standards of harmony.
There are many others in the same
category which are being foisted upon
the public as “hits of the day.”
Our young people are receiving a mix-
ture of the very good and the very bad,
and it is easier for them to pick up the
latter. Love of harmony should be in-
culcated wherever possible, not only in
music and painting, but in every form of
life. Could we but appreciate the fact,
harmony is an integral part of all natural
phenomena, and a very essential factor
in the lives of all of us. It is sacrilege
to utilise broadcasting as a means to
disrupt the teachings of harmony.—T. C.
(N.S.W.),
History
Much of the blame for the high per-
centage of Leftists among University
graduates can be attributed to the so-
called “economic interpretation of
history ’ now being taught ad nauseam
in ’varsities Tawney and company are
taken as gospel, while Macaulay, Green
and Trevelyan are superciliously dis-
missed as outmoded —although they will
be read and respected long after Tawney
and his kind have joined the dodo.
One fresh young B.A. was honest
enough to confess that he was a socialist
only because of the theories he had been
imbibing, and that experience in practical
affairs might cleanse his brain of the
trash he had absorbed. — Dutigalla
(Vic.).
Advertising on Buses
When the hideous advertisements first
appeared on Sydney’s buses recently, the
Transport Department announced that
the innovation was “on trial for three
months.” Since the mechanical efficiency
of the vehicles is not likely to be im-
paired by disfigurement or extra weight,
and since advertisers will certainly sup-
port the new medium, it is clear that only
public reaction remains to be tested.
Some of the suburban councils have
met the challenge by expressing their dis-
favor in resolutions, but the voices of
artists, civic designers and leaders of
cultural and aesthetic thought are
strangely silent when they should have
been raised to save our streets from a
procession of garish nightmares.
The argument of the department is
that the buses don’t pay. If this is so
the department should study the adminis-
tration of Melbourne’s transport, which
returns a handsome profit.—J. O’B.
(N.S.W.),
Building Costs
As “Wusslean” (B. 9/4/’47) says,
many factors contribute to high building
costs, but no reduction can be expected
until contractors are compelled to aban-
don the cost-plus system-, under which
there is no incentive for employer or
tradesman to speed uj| building or to
eliminate waste of materials. At present
the higher the cost the greater the rake-off
for the contractor.
I rent a country property which is
being renovated for the owner, who is at
present in another State, On the job
are five carpenters, three plumbers, four
painters, two bricklayers, three laborers
and a foreman. They have been at it for
eight weeks, and, at the present rate of
progress, the painters will be working for
another three weeks. Work nominally
starts at 7 a.m. and ceases at 5.30 p.m.
four days a week, and at 1 p.m, on Fri-
days. Wages and overtime are computed
from time of leaving their boarding-
houses at 6.45 a.m. until their return at
5.45 p.m. There’s a ten minutes’ ad-
journment for morning tea and half an
hour for lunch.
In actual practice operations com-
mence at any time between 7.20 and
7.45 a.m., morning tea occupies between
20 and 30 minutes and lunch takes be-
tween 45 minutes and an hour. The day’s
work ceases at between 4.50 p.m, and
5.10 p.m. and quiet descends on the
property at 5.15 p.m.
One would feel moderately happy if,
during the intervals between recognised
spells, a reasonable amount of work
were done. But it isn’t. Watching one
carpenter I noted that his output for the
day was the fitting of two mortice locks,
which, incidentally, were replaced a fort-
night later by another carpenter. Un-
ceasing fag-rolling and discussions on
beer and women seem to take up half the
working time.
Under the cost -plus system the boss
collects ten per cent, on all time worked
or wasted —his commission is based on
wages, overtime, country allowances,
payment for board and lodging for em-
ployees on country jobs and taxi fares to
work. The same commission is paid on
materials,'their transport, telephone and
telegraph communications and a percent-
age of city office expenses.— Rapide
(Vic.).
War Memorials
I notice that the Chifley Cabinet has
decided to spend a packet of money on
erecting memorials to the Diggers. At
the same time thousands of ex-service-
men suffering from war neurosis cannot
get proper attention from Repat. because
it has neither the conveniences nor the
doctors.
The R.S.L. has had to open its own
centre. The Air Force Association is ap-
pealing for funds for the same purpose.
Diggers do not want the type of
memorial proposed by Chif. and certainly
have never asked for them. Apparently
the ex-servicemen’s organisations were not
consulted before the announcement was
made. Any memorial should be of bene-
fit to the living, not just a monument to
the dead. — Recco (N.S.W.),
Waiting on Wharfies
Just before the 1943 Federal election
a “Labor” Minister visiting Queensland
in the interests of his party was approached
by officials of the watersiders’ organisa-
tion with a request that his Government
establish a canteen where the men could
buy hot meals, particularly when required
to work overtime at night. The Minister
was in favor, but, as building materials
were not available, Army authorities
arranged to provide the meals at a cost
of Is. 6d. per head until a canteen could
be built.
Beginning in June, 1943, meals were
supplied at three wharves each night,
Saturdays and Sundays included. The
work was not easy, because the Army
unit detailed for the job was on a very
restricted war establishment and had to
draw on transit troops to supply the
labor. Strikes nearly occurred several
times because the soldiers resented distri-
buting meals to waterside “workers,” who
were not doing their best to get supplies
to units in the islands. As the soldiers
detailed to serve meals were generally
reinforcements going forward they took
a very poor view of working for the
wharfies. It was only by the diplo-
matic handling of these men by the CO.
of the unit and his officers that sufficient
labor was obtained and the work carried
out.
There were occasions on the
wharves when the tension was almost at
breaking strain, and office*s and staff
were relieved when the last meal was
served and they were able to pack up
and return to camp.
Just before the election the situation
was very delicate, when officials of the
Waterside Workers’ Federation were con-
tinually reminding their members that
the meals were provided because of the
efforts of the “Labor” party.
The work was continued'for 16 months,
during which time the Army supplied
165,451 meals. Every meal served pro-
vided for a minimum of three hours’ over-
time, making a total of 496,353 man-
hours. At 6s. 3d. an hour the total earn-
ings of the watersiders for that period
were about £156,000.
The supply of foodstuffs and transport
of meals cost the Army £6650, and the
preparation and distribution about £240..
Income to the Army was approximately
£12,400, a clear profit of about £5500
The Army worked 14,420 man-hours to
prepare and distribute meals to allow the
watersiders to earn approximately
£156,000 at 6s. 3d. an hour. The soldiers
were paid at approximately 4d. an hour
It would be interesting to hear if the em
ployees of the canteens that are now
established at Brisbane are doing the
work for the same average rate as the
soldiers did for 16 months. — One of the
Servers (Q.).
Plums of Office
Minister of Air Drakeford, accom-
panied by his wife and daughter, are
attending another air conference, this
time in Montreal, at the taxpayers’ ex-
pense. Surely the Minister’s family is
not necessary for the success of the con-
ference.
In the large organisation to which 1
belong several of our representatives have
gone overseas on business reasons dur-
ing the last 18 months. In no case have
they taken their families —but of course
they work for a private concern where
efficiency and expense are vital considera-
tions.
The question of the family joyride at
the taxpayers’ expense was raised in the
Federal House, but it was not pressed to
any degree. Probably Opposition mem-
bers realise that, with the turn of the poli-
tical wheel, they will occupy the Gov-
ernment bench.es and then it will be their
turn to grab the plums, fft’s a de-
pressing view, but events of past years
justify it.—C. B. M. (N.S.W.).
A Real Achievement
With the final transfer of the functions
of the Health Division of U.N.R.R.A. to
the Interim Commission of the World
Health Organisation the greatest and most
beneficial of all public-health efforts in
history has entered a new phase—that of
maintaining continued control over epi-
demic diseases against whose worst
ravages it has protected mankind for
more than three war-stricken years.
When the Health Division came into
seing most of the national health services
“Mum said could you plug it in for us—We've just had our power cut off!"
were paralysed or broken by the wars.
There was an unprecedented shortage of
health-protective supplies and facilities as
well as the loss of trained personnel, dis-
organisation of health services and isola-
tion from interchange of scientific know-
ledge. The League of Nations Health
Organisation in Geneva and the Interna-
tional Office of Public Health in Paris
had been put out of action, as was the
Rockefeller Foundation’s European ac-
tivities. Vast displaced, homeless and
undernourished populations threatened
the world with war-engendered epidemics
on a gigantic scale.
British and American sanitarians united
in a joint effort to cope with this grim
situation. In November, 1943, 44 nations,
including Australia, signed an agreement
to organise against it, and a month later
U.N.R.R.A.’s Health Division came into
being. The most pressing problem was
typhus fever, particularly in Poland,
where, under less imminent conditions,
some 230,000 cases had occurred in 1919.
Over 3393 tons of 10 p.c. D.D.T. powder
applied with specially-designed dust-
pumps to persons who had been exposed
to infection reduced incidence to fewer
than 12,000 cases in 1945, and to 2937 in
1946. The same fell disease in Yugo-
slavia was reduced from over 50,000 cases
in 1945 to 3000 in 1946.
Typhoid fever was brought under even
more effective control. Plague and cholera
were kept out of Europe except for a
few cases of the former in southern Italy.
Vast supplies of antidiphtheric toxoid
and anti-toxin were sept to the assisted
countries. A campaign against malaria in
Greece brought the disease under com-
plete control, the first time that this had
ever been done on any national scale.
Pneumonic plague in Manchuria and
cholera in China were handled success-
fully on an unprecedented scale.
The international make-up of the or-
ganisation is evidenced by the fact that
110 of its 489 medical officers were
British ; seven of them, together with 12
nurses, Australian ninety medical
officers came from the U.S.A. and the
rest from 35 other countries. To the total
of 1134 physicians, dentists, nurses,
sanitary engineers and other associated
professions, the U.S.S.R. contributed one
(I) member, a physician.— Galenus (Q.),
Rabbi&s
“C.E.’s” rabbit problem (B. 30/4/’47)
is as common in N. S. Wales as it is in
Victoria. There’s nothing more galling
than to clean up a holding, and then to
have to wage an unceasing battle against
marauding bunnies from a neighbor’s
property. But there are two opposing
schools of thought on the subject, and
while a packed chaffbag of skins will
return £BO or £9O (as they did last winter),
there seems little hope of a systematic
attack on the pest.
Many graziers carry their neglect as far
as the vigilance of the rabbit inspector
will allow and are prepared, like the
blackmarket operator, to risk a fine, which,
at the most, represents the value of a few
pounds of skins. They reason that the
winter’s trapping and poisoning will sub-
stantially augment their incomes, especi-
ally when the use of onfe or more assumed
names on the consignments makes their
transactions tax-free. The fallacy in that
attitude is the failure to take into account
the denudation of pastureland and conse-
quent sferious soil erosion—bare hilltops,
gullied slopes and scald patches on land
which, in addition to its normal sheep-
load, is forced to carry an equivalent “in-
visible” burden of the destroyers.
If such graziers could take a long-term
view and balance the inevitable future
loss of carrying capacity against the
immediate gain, they might be more active
in rabbit eradication. But it is hard to
get anyone to be longsighted with winter
skins bringing 2s. 6d. each. Again, some
graziers are too busy to keep control
personally, and thus let their paddocks
by custom or agreement to professional
rabbiters, who, if bound by the arrange-
ment to round-the-year trapping, go slow
until the winter brings higher prices.
Thus many a block barely adequate for
the support of one family often supports
that of the trapper as well.
Land will take a terrific beating, but
there is a limit. That is plainly indicated
by the enormous acreage which has be-
come useless since white settlement and
land exploitation began. Barwon
