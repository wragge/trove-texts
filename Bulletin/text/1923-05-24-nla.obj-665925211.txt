The Red Page
Wings—and Song
When did Life first sing? Science cannot
tell us: its dim eyes peer backward in vain;
it listens with ears that cannot hear. Yet
the flowering of silence into song is far more
wonderful than the flowering of matter into
organic beauty; the, evolution of man’s body
is nothing compared with the miraculous
growth of his soul. “Milton” and “Keats ’
are not the names of a blind old man and a
boy who tasted only the bitterness of love
and deatn: these were, and are not. Those
names are the names of immortal songs re-
sounding this very moment through our
souls; pealing organ notes whose nine-fold
harmony fills earth. and sea and sky; high-
strung ecstasy that was not born for death.
The stars wander through space, and Life
is a wanderer among the stars, and all are
seeking for ever the secret of their being.
This wandering instinct, this sense that here
we have no abiding place, is the source of ail
physical and spiritual achievement: it is a
physical truth that all lAfe is change, but
ft is a spiritual truth that all Life is seeking.
Man has three selves and each is a wan-
derer. Our physical self has set its flag on
dither pole, has conquered the air, and is
even now scaling Solitude’s last citadel of
everlasting snow. And then? If still there
be time, the moon and Mars. Our intellec-
tual self has explored the universe from the
Electron to the Pleiades, but to whatever
heights it has risen imagination has led the
way—lmagination, our noblest self, now on
Wide pinions circling high over Life and
death and time outward to the confines of
eternity.
There is sadness in the eyes of Imagination
& she strives to utter her infinite vision:
she can, alas! only speak to us as we speak
to deaf-mutes —not in our own tongue, but
in the labored finger-play that, is all they
know. This speech of ours, with all its in-
spired melody, is but a deaf-and-dumb alpha-
bet. to Imagination that sees all the king-
doms of the world in a moment of time.
Human speech is still the language of the
mind, not of the soul; so the best Imagina-
tion can do for us now is, not to impart a
few ideas, but to suggest a thousand —not to
instruct the mind, but to inspire it.
~ We cannot yet imagine the beginning of
Ljie or of matter: the origin of the electron
is. for the present, beyond our ken. We only
know that Life must have lived in the whirl-
ing globe of fire that was once this earth, as
purely as it lives in us to-day, and will con-
tinue to live when the earth is frozen solid:
Protean Life has nothing to fear from the
slow cycles of stellar change.
< We speak of the cycles of time as “slow”
only because our sense of time is as unde-
veloped as our sense of space. But Imagina-
tion, hovering high, looks down on the count-
less ages flickering by with the rapidity of a
cinema film, each age one of ten thousand dis-
tinct images whose flying sequence makes
Up the moving picture of Life —Life, leap-
ing in a moment of eternity from fire to
Water, from water to dry land, from dry land
upward through the blue and onward for
ever. Let us turn the wheel a little slower
to see more clearly this wondrous Life, of
Which we were and are and shall forever
gjmain a part, swimming, crawling, running,
ying onward through all its countless forms.
Life is forever seeking—from star to sun,
from sun to earth and onward for ever to
the uttermost star. Our mortal eyes catch
but a blurred glimpse of it flashing through
this instant of wonder that is our being.
Its gropiug experiments and grotesque fail-
ures, its deliberate cruelty and dreadful suf-
fering, its seething cauldron of birth-in-
leatli, confound our minds. But Imagina-'
fcion thrills to hear through all the weeping
and wailing of chaos a ceaseless sound of
rushing wings, the rhythmic throb of climb-
ing wings, and a far song of winged souls
flying on their way, singing for very ecstasy
because they have to sing.
We may well believe that the morning
stars sang together and all the Sons of God
shouted for joy when the foundations of the
earth were laid, but we must now be con-
tent to seek the beginning of song as we
know it, in the vapor-laden deep that covered
the earth, when the Spirit of God moved on
the face of the waters before the dry land
appeared.
Did Life shout for joy when _it _ passed
from fire to water? Did it sing in its first
bath? Science is dubious —no fossil song has
yet been found —so Imagination flashes
through “the dark backward and abysm of
time,” and our eyes look once again on that
primeval sea whose great white horses race
unbroken round a shoreless world. Nor sun,
nor moon, nor stars have shone upon that
dreadful waste, swathed for ever in swelter-
ing vapor; its hot darkness glimmers only
where columns of red fire and dry steam boil
and roar as the drowning earth heaves up-
ward in gasping volcanoes—there, even, Life
triumphs on its way through that triumphant
sea. Myriad fishes cruise and explore and leap
high in air—for ever seeking. And because
they seek they find. Even as we watch, their
filmy fins unfold into great tremulous wings,
beautiful and frail "as the glorious wings of
the flying gurnard; they have found that
other world for which they' sought; they
skim upward in vast flights, wheeling past
those baleful columns of red fire, and in the
vaporous air their fragile pinions never dry.
But suddenly terror blasts them; the sun
breaks through the pall of cloud ; their frail
wings dry and crackle; they fall back into
the sea. Life, for ever seeking, must once
again turn defeat to victory, must once again
find wings—and song.
j Did those fin-winged creatures really sing
for joy " when they leapt to freedom from the
prisoning sea and soared away through the
mysterious grey on their ethereal wings?
Out of the mist of myth still comes to us
faintly the sound of sirens singing and the
muffled booming of Triton’s wreathed horn,
and even Science pricks, its long ears, hear-
ing the musical note of an extant Mediter-
ranean fish, although sceptical as to
its familiarity with scales. Science
may scoff at the eternal verities of
myth, but it cannot deny its very own fish
whose primordial wings have withered back
to fins, but in whose melancholy piping
Imagination hears an eeho of earth’s first
weird song. There is also our own pretty
little striped “trumpeter,” silent under water,
but tragically vocal in air as it flaps to death,
plaintively trumpeting its own “Last Post. ’
The Queensland “lung fish” still perches
birdlike among the birds, brooding in silence
on his family legend of a vast amphibian
empire of warm water and wet air, before
the fierce sun routed the friendly mist, and
the dry land over-ran the sea. Who has not
peered down at the beautiful flying gurnard
—now also silent, alas!- —as it slowly fans
its way through the clogging water on wide
wings of brilliant blue. _ What ages have
passed since those very wings flickered west-
ward in vain flight from the pursuing terror.
And the little flying-fish, lineal descendant of
heroic ancestors, that still lingers in tropic
seas —what wonder that he, too, is now
silent, finding no inspiration in his low
flight on semi-artificial wings that need to
be constantly wetted.
Enough ! Imagination’s vision of Life and
its deathless triumph over death is sufficient
for us. We have more than seen Life fall
like a falling star into that primeval deep.
We have remembered —we have re-lived it
all again ; for this Life of ours is the self-
same Life that was there, seeking and find-
ing then, as! now, its wings—and song.
There Life first dreamed the dream of
Melba’s liquid notes. The soul of Milton
swam in that monstrous deep; Keats leapt
from the foam of those perilous seas.
Without wings there is no song. Later
the Red Page may allow us to seek further
glimpses of this scientific fact, which is also
a spiritual truth inspiring the long tragedy
of life—most of all, our own.
DOWELL O'REILLY.
Literature and the Washing
The French authoress who intends to take
legal proceedings because her private letter's
have been sold at auction will have a lot of
sympathy the world over, whether her action
succeeds or not. There is no more distress-
ing feature of our times than the desire for
matter of sensational gossip raked from the
rubbisli-tips of the past. While the works
of the great writer remain unread, his let-
ters on private affairs are eagerly devoured,
the more eagerly if they contain anything
to his apparent discredit. Yet the fact is
often obvious that he was a poor letter-
writer, and that these fragments have no
more literary value, and possibly less human
importance, than the notes Jones, in the
next-house-but-one, sent by the butcher-boy
to the lady living three doors from the pawn-
shop. Jones was possibly a splendidly ex-
travagant lover who rose to his greatest
mental height in those letters, while the
famous writer penned things on which he
set no value in the moments when his brain
was more or less exhausted by bigger efforts.
The claim that the famous writer is best
seen in the work he did when his mind was
most off its guard is an absurd one. You
might as well say that a Prime Minister’s
ability to rule was best shown by the way
he played cribbage after an exhausting
public meeting. All men are best judged by
their best. There can be rib other real stand-
ard ; for if you push the details of living
down far enough you can reach a level where
all men are exactly alike. It is just possible
that this fundamental likeness is the basis
of the l@ve of scandalous gossip which shows
itself in innumerable publications. Some
touch of greatness is required to appreciate
greatness in others. The fact that no man
is a hero to his valet is only partially true;
but it is an uncontrovertible fact that no
man living or dead is or ever could be a
hero to the thousands of garbage-eaters who
hunger for the discarded wastage of a famous
man’s daily life. EMU-gorged with this sort
of thing, they cry with infinite satisfaction,
“See! He was just like us, after all. Poetry!
Why, the fellow had corns and smoked cheap
cigars!” . ....
All this would matter little were it not
for its effect on the writers themselves and
their publishers. Unfortunately the buyers
of gossip about people whose work has been
accepted or praised are many, and still more
unfortunately. there is an attempt to manu-
facture material for them by the people who
should most resent intrusion into their pri-
vacy. To reach tlio many is the desire of
a great multitude of writers; to. reach them
on tlieir own ground by pandering to their
tastes is a temptation before which scores
have fallen. Eccentricity is often natural
enough in men whose work is out of the
common, and eccentricity makes good adver-
tisement. So, to keep tlie way open for the
advertiser, the gossip-monger must be
allowed plenty of room ; and more and more
the straight way of literature—the pathway
for the man with something to say and the
eager will to say it —is narrowed and re-
stricted. Nobody is allowed to be the voice
of one crying in the wilderness. He must
be the shape of one posing in a mountebank
show also.
The hearty, though possibly unthinking,
accomplice of the gossip-monger is the col-
lector. Every scrap of manuscript from the
pen of a writer of any consequence has a
market value. If John Milton had written
a memo, to the office-cleaner asking him to
dust his table more carefully, there are people
who would pay hundreds of pounds for the
precious document. Yet among those bid-
ders there might not be one man who could
remember a line of “Paradise Host” nor one
who had “E’Allegro” singing in his mind.
There are actually buyers of manuscript in
Australia who would pay more, for the. un-
published manuscripts of a few living writers
among us than anv paper can afford to pay
for the right to publish the matter. Natu-
rally, to such people, scraps of private cor-
respondence are treasures, and nothing is
more certain than that sooner or later any-
thing unusual contained in them will be
published. When Chesterton declares that
the world’s wastepaper-baskets are as sacred
as the tomb be is stating what should be a
commonplace of literarv decency. Unfortu-
natelv, the collector is not a literary man,
and has quite different standards of decency.
The literary worker in every honest field has
a bard struggle all his life to get enough

self, how far am I justified in leaving that
letter about for other eyes to see? Clearly,
I could scarcely do a shabbier thing if Theo-
critus is my friend, or a more vindictive thing
if he is my enemy. And the position is made
much worse if I know that the letter of Theo-
critus has a selling value. There is no
sense in which the writer belongs to his
public. The fact that he sold his work does
not imply that he sold himself; and the bits
of his private life revealed to the mob are
as something stolen from him. Possibly he
may feel that when he is dead the revelation
will matter little ; but possibly also he may
fiercely resent it as clouding the thing he
spent his life trying to say. So the gossip-
monger may fairly be regarded not only as
the foe of the writer, but as the enemy of
literature. The remedy lies with writers of
imagination who desire to protect real effort
from those who work to make it ineffective.
Let them spread written material about them
which will give the gossips something to
gabble and gobble over. Let Theocritus
write to Catullus of the difficulty he had
in hiding the bloodstains, and how the image
of the dead has haunted him ; let him explain
to Petronius the difficulty he has in con-
structing a sonnet since he mislaid the
saw; let him tell Pliny how he stole the
affections of Lavinia, and how the dear girl
wanted him to run away to America and be
a picture-star. Then Petronius can reply
telling a dreadful tale of the way he killed
the copy-boy by mistake for the Archbishop ;
and Catullus can hint darkly that he cannot
write an ode without first cutting a hole in
the toe of his left sock. Pliny and Cicero
can hold a fierce battle of words, accusing
each other of theft, rape, drinking ice-cream
sodas and making love to a daily newspaper.
Done sufficiently often, and on a sufficiently
extensive scale, this should have the effect
of driving half the gossip-mongers insane
with sheer joy, while the other half devote
their energies to proving the falsity of the
claims of the authors. In the end nobody
would believe any scandal about any author
—nor anything else, for that matter —and
the collector would burn his treasures in the
back yard and confine himself to first edi-
tions of books, taking care that the editions
were unsigned and unlimited. When the
noise died down and the dust settled the
public might find that it preferred reading
the authors to merely reading about them.
D. M. W.
Cook and Australia
Captain James Cook was a great navi-
gator and a great man. He needs no laurels
that he did not fairly earn. It is, therefore,
a pity that such floods of inaccurate and
misleading nonsense continue to be poured
out about his relationship to Australia. The
purchase of Cook’s log and the anniversary
(kept up a day or tw r o ahead) of his land-
ing at Botany Bay have led to a new deluge.
Popular writers and speakers still parade
the absurdity of his “discovery” of Australia.
(Some of them make him discover Sydney
Harbor, by the way.) Cook himself, of
course, was better informed, and he says
almost in so many words that if he had
had a stouter and better-found vessel he
would not have wasted time on Australia.
After he had spent some six months in chart-
ing the coasts of Maoriland he had to decide
about the route of his return home. His
wish was to go back by Cape Horn and
settle once for all the question as to the
existence of a continental terra incognita
in the southern hemisphere. He had proved
that Maoriland was no part of such a conti-
nent, but there was still room for it in the
vast stretches of ocean between those islands
and South America. There "was, on the
other hand, nothing of the terra incognita
about Australia. Tasman had circumnavi-
gated it, and the Dutch had put more than
half the coastline on the map; roughly, it
is true, yet with a fair approximation to
the truth. But winter was coming on, and
Cook did not feel that; he would be justified
in taking the risks of the Cape Horn route.
To keep south and go by way of the Cape
of Good Hope would also involve danger,
without even the hope of finding a new conti-
nent. So, in the spirit of one making the
best of a bad job, Cook stood away for the
land mapped 130 years before by Abel Tas-
man, and decided to trace the east coast of
New Holland.
Having regretfully put behind him the
alluring attraction of trying to find some-
thing really new, Cook did his job of chart-
ing the east coast of Australia well, as far
as the time and means at his command
allowed. It is true that he did not spend as
long on the coast of Australia (including a
compulsory detention of over six weeks at
the Endeavor River) as he did on that of
Maoriland, but then he was in a hurry. And.
besides, he seems to have been much more
interested in Maoriland than in Australia.
That he spent six days in Botany Bay with-
out discovering Port Jackson would be re-
markable if we did not understand that he
wasn’t greatly interested. True, there are
some rather mushy remarks in the “Voyages
of Captain Cook” about the beautiful mea-
dows of Botany Bay and the possibilities of
the soil. But if they are really Cook’s they
show that he, like other sailors, was either a
poor judge of land values or had not taken
much care to learn the facts.
Cook visited Maoriland on each of his two
other great voyages, but he never troubled
his head about the mainland of Australia
again, though he did put into Adventure
Bay (Tas.) in 1777.
In one sense the real founder of Australia
was George Washington. It was the suc-
cessful revolt of the American colonies and
the closing of their ports against British
convicts that forced the British Government
to look for an outlet elsewhere. It tried
Newfoundland and Africa before settling on
Australia. The man who first suggested the
use of Australia, and was, more than any
other, responsible for its final selection, was
Sir Joseph Banks. Though Banks never re-
visited Australia he remained its good friend
and supporter to the end of his long and
useful life.
Nearly a century before Cook. Dampier,
setting out, unlike Cook, for the express
purpose of exploring the Australian coast,
had decided to go round Cape Horn and
across the Pacific. Had he done so he might
well have traced the east coast of Australia
70 years before Cook. But his vessel was
not good and his crew grumbled, so lie went
the other way and missed it. For some-
what similar reasons Cook balked at the
Cape Horn route and found it. One man’s
meat is another man’s poison.
D. F.
Thackeray
Personally I am not concerned with the
point made by Fred J. Broomfield (R.P.
26/4/’23) that Thackeray is not an ironist
and merely a satirist, but I am jealous of his
honor as a disinterested observer of manners
and morals, and I claim that in writing down
Thackeray Mr. Broomfield has done a dis-
service to literature.
In the first place, to assert that there is
in Thackeray’s “attempted” irony the “per-
vasive malice of the servants’ hall” is both
snobbish and inaccurate. I have never before
met one person who found the slightest sug-
gestion of malice in his work. Malice is a
cheap and commonplace charge to bring
against a satirist, but it comes badly from
one protecting the reputation of men like
Swift and Sterne. Take this sentence:
“The social criticism of the Grand Mogul
of Snobdom has always been the suggestion
of the betrayal of intimate secrets.” Could
anything more ridiculous be said of Thack-
eray? Some of W.M.T.’s keenest darts were
directed against the sort of person who
carries from dining-tables and drawing-
rooms choice morceaux for the clubs or the
newspapers.
Mr. Broomfield makes the amazing state-
ment that W.M.T.’s satire would be ineffec-
tive if the person against whom it was
directed were a little richer or a little
greater. One is at a loss to imagine the
basis of such a criticism. It is obvious
that those making a show of wealth which
they do not possess, or of rank, nobility or
greatness that is not theirs, are the very
people who leave themselves open to the
satirist. There is nothing wrong or ludi-
crous in being rich or great, and satire’s
darts are harmless when directed against
the truly great or the merely rich. It is
those who profess to be what they are not
—those who truckle and crawl to the rich
and who lick the dust at the door of the
great —who are base. These were the people
that Thackeray flayed. I wish we had one
such to do a like service to-day.
The critic suggests that Thackeray cheap-
ened the grandeur of my lord and my lady
because he envied it. This statement shows
either lamentable prejudice or inexcusable
ignorance. Thackeray stripped from my
lord and my lady not their natural dignity
or virtue, but their artificial greatness, their
assumed grandeur, their selfish pride, their
callous worldliness, their calculating avarice.
He showed them to the world not as my
lord and my lady, but as man and woman,
and he opened the eyes of his generation to
the hollowness of the pretensions of many
who assumed such superiority over their
fellows.
Thackeray lived in an age when the ordi-
nary man spoke of a noble with lowered
breath irrespective of his worth as a human
being. He was one of the first great men
of his generation who cared nothing for the
mandarin, the nabob and the grandee. He
had the courage and the public spirit to
mercilessly criticise and ridicule their weak-
nesses, not merely because these were per-
sonal failings, but bjecause their faults re-
acted on and grievously oppressed tens of
thousands of fellow beings. He showed to
a sycophantic age that there was nothing
terrifying about mere rank. He released his
generation from the crushing load of ser-
vility under which it labored. He showed
that the rank is but the guinea stamp; that
the aristocracy of the day was, after all,
largely composed of stupid and rather ridi-
culous creatures; that nobility of rank had
no relation to nobility of character; that
morality and humanity were factors of real
importance in determining a man’s rank. In
doing this he fulfilled the legitimate func-
tions of a satirist,*and if William Makepeace
Thackeray were malicious, then there is no
such thing as satire. Though Englishmen may
still dearly love a lord, the fact that they no
longer fear him very much or take very much
notice of his opinions, is largely due to Thack-
eray. When Lytton and the like were cring-
ing to “their betters” and pandering in their
writings to aristrocratic vanity and folly,
Thackeray was hard at work emancipating
his fellow’s from the bonds of snobbery and
the social domination of a gang of nihcom-
poops.
With regard to Thackeray’s criticism of
the English humorists, he was no prig or
wow r ser, but he. had a manly man’s contempt
for the filth and obscenity of Swift and the
personal nastiness of Sterne. Wouldn’t any
decent man detest ihese things? Mr. Broom-
field’s description of Swift as • “the austere
old Dean” is positively ludicrous.
Perhaps the charge that W.M.T. was not
very much of a human brother to human
brother is the most unkindest cut of all.
F.J.B. says Thackeray did not like Dickens,
and there w’ere many w’ho did not. But
whether he did like Dickens or not, he
showered generous encomiums on his great
contemporary. Does he not speak of the
“pure and unsullied pages” of “David Cop-
perfield”; does he not say somewhere that
every line of “Copperfield” is like a precious
gift to the reader; does he not tell a story
of his little girl climbing on his knee and
asking him w’hy he did not write books like
Mr. Dickens and of his replying to her that
he wished he could do so? There are many
noble and disinterested tributes to Dickens
in Thackeray’s works, but I do not remem-
ber Dickens writing one line of appreciation
of the greatness, the humanity, the devotion
to good womanhood, the love of honorable
love (F.J.B. sneeringly calls it sentimen-
tality) of M. A. Titmarsh.
Thackeray detested Lytton, because Bul-
wer w-as a poseur, humbug, pedant and syco-
phant. In this he showed not a lack of
brotherly love, but the ordinary feelings of
a warm-hearted, generous soul.
JOSEPH A. ALEXANDEY.
A Satchel of Books
And in the Tomb Were Found, by Terence Gray
(W. Heffer and Sons). Another of the swarm
of works about old Egypt published apparently in
intelligent anticipation of the recent Luxor dis-
coveries. It consists of four fragmentary- plays
built up on the available material dealing with the
drama and passion of civilised life 6000 years ago,
and of some love songs and dirges translated from
the Harris papyrus in the British Museum.
The Tattooed Arm ., by r Isabel Ostrander (Hurst
and Blackett). How a family r ’B fortune was founded
on overtime with a counterfeiter’s plant, and how
the fraud was exposed by- a couple of Moo Yoik
detectives, who have a passion for being handy at
Psychological Moments, is explained in 287 pages of
fairly thrilling matter. The yarn is not the best
of the writer’s ingenious fictions, and it has the
further defect of importing its chief crook from Aus-
tralia. This unpatriotic neglect of a thriving native
industry will be bitterly- resented by Yankee re-
viewers.
The Far Eastern Republic, by Henry Norton
(George Allen and Unwin). A plain story of how
Trans-Baikalia first cut loose from Russia, then
ousted the Japanese and finally became established
as a self-governing nation. Its potentialities are
enormous. Three times the size of France, it has
some of the most productive fishing grounds, and
probably the most valuable timber area, in the
world, in addition to great mineral wealth. It
is governed by a Constituent Assembly of ex-Com-
munists, ex-Anarchists, ex-Monarchists and others. Or,
rather, it is mis-governed. As recently as the end
of last month a cable mentioned that all Americans
had been advised by the U.S. Consul at VladiVostock
to leave that port, though it is the chief centre of
Yankee trade in those parts. The author is in
sympathy with the leading men of the Government,
and clearly believes that the Westernisation of this
wonderful land * is only a question of time and
popular education.
The Secret of Woman (Boni and Liveright).
Helen Jerome, who has written excellent verse for
The Bulletin, now enters the field of prose philo-
sophy-. The tendency of modern man is to question
whether Woman, as Woman, has a secret. In his
opinion she may be a Faustine just as a man may
be a Casanova, or a St. Cecilia just as a man may
be a St. Anthony. Helen Jerome envisages her as
something more standardised: —
“What no male writer seems to understand is that
woman is not, cannot be, never has been, promis-
cuous and polygamous as man is A woman
can care for a man in every way except sexually ;
physically he may leave her totally unmoved, and
even rouse in iter a distinct antipathy which she
nevertheless tries for the sake of her love for him
to conquer. This does not mean that she is anaes-
thetic to passion. She may feel it acutely for some
other man whose presence, except physically, does
not give her half so much real satisfaction.””
This, of course, is not to say that woman is differ-
ent from man, but only that most women are
driven by economic forces to marry for other reasons
than passion. Exactly the same emotions are experi-
enced, no doubt, by the ambitious barrister who
marries “the rich attorney’s ugly, elderly daughter.”
The problem is of perennial interest to both sexes,
and Mrs. Jerome tackles it with a good humor.
The book is advertised as a smashing blow at H.
L. Mencken, who recently wrote some home truths
about Woman, but really the lady does not smite
the eminent American with anything heavier than
a duster. '
At Half-past Eight, Essays of the Theatre, 1921-
1922, by James Agate (Jonathan Cape). Agate is
the latest to don the peplum of the infallible in the
Saturday Review. He was originally very readable
as dramatic critic of the Manchester Guardian,
and he Wrote one promising novel, “Responsibility,”
but since he joined the Review aforesaid he has
become over-bookish. He tries to defend the use of
quotations in a pretentiously artless preface; but
dramatic criticism is a branch of literature that
seems to grow pompous and empty when overloaded
with learning. Yet Agate is only repeating the
defects of the genteel English school of theatrical
chroniclers. Instead of the brief, whizzing sentence
that would immediately expose the hollowness of an
actor or a play, he piles up imponderabilia. The book,
however, is marked by amiability and good taste,
and the author is sharp enough to mitigate the effect
of his confounded superiority by early announcing
a relish for the music-hall.
Beneath an Ardent Sun, by Frank Fox (Hodder
and Stoughton), is a novel of' pre-war Australian
life. The heroine is a young woman whose disillu-
sionment with wedlock has come early:
“It was just at the end of the ceremony [in St.
Philip’s, Sydney] that a shrill female voice, raised
almost to a scream, broke in upon the music and
wakened Rose Curtis suddenly, irreparably, to a sense
of the reality of things. Some of the more scan-
dalous newspapers of the time tell of the scene in
detail —of a young- girl with a baby in her arms.”
The father of the illicit infant further complicates
the situation by getting drunk at the wedding-
breakfast. What could Rose do but leave him'?
Unfortunately he was no gentleman:—
“She had to remain his wife; called on to resist
his importunities; once actually carried off and
saving herself by an unfeminine skill of epee, which
made her slender parasol a weapon which could and
did stun, which threatened and would inflict, if
need be, death.”
Then she sprains both ankles in the Blue Mountains,
is found at nightfall by the Prime Minister (puny-
looking, yet powerful; the possessor, of a sound taste
in neckties; and aged 38), and is carried in his
arms to her boarding-house five miles away. Of
course there is a love affair. They go camping-
together and the P.M. “offers her to drink”:—
“She sipped, laughed her thanks.
“ ‘But it is not enough.’ \
“They stretched prostrate, then, side by side to
the stream and drank, dipping mouths and chins
into its coolness, and then dabbling lingers in the
water and talking between draughts.
“‘lt is a sign, is it not, of a sluggard soldier—
this way of drinking?’
“ ‘You remember your Scripture, Rose.’
“ ‘But I love a deep draught in the morning.’
“ ‘And I confess to a fever of thirst.’
“ ‘Truly there are fires burning. You will think
me shameless, Harry.’
“ ‘lf I could but talk like Endymion I would
answer you.’ ”
Such cheap preciosities are compensated for by some
admirable descriptive stuff, which alone makes the
book worth reading.
The Heal Horatio Bottomley, by Henrv J.
Houston (Hurst and Blackett).. This history of an
ingenious scoundrel is by one who was his secretary
for 13 years. Bottomley, it seems, was the offspring
of a tailor’s cutter who lived at. Bethnal Green and
died in a “fit of mania.” Bottomley’s mother was
a sister of George Jacob Holyoake, the celebrated
co-operator, and it is recorded that Bradlaugh told
Holyoake that “young Bottomley would turn out a
bad man.” The cause of his downfall was ever
his inordinate love of money. The amount he had
to play with can be gauged from the fact that, out
of the £750,000 received from his three huge
schemes —-the War Stock Combination, the Victory
Bond Club, and the Thrift Prize Bond Club—onlv
£149,000 has been traced as having been returned
to the subscribers. Where the rest went only hotel
proprietors, bookmakers, bucket-shop speculators,
and a tribe of pretty ladies can tell. He built a
private racecourse after he had been declared a bank-
rupt, and, at the outbreak of war in 1914. he was
racing at Ostend and had a squad of jockey's and
retainers living at the most fashionable hotel in the
place. His political activities were equally expen-
sive, and his vaunted patriotism during the war
covered a multitude of shameless sins. The numerous
speeches he delivered at music-halls at the height of
the struggle were paid fpr as “extra turns,” and he
even made it a rule to vary the quality of his oraton-
according to the fee he received. Houston tries to
palliate the effect of his indictment by reciting some
of Bottomley’s personal generosities, but these look
pitifully trivial, and even tend to increase the enor-
mity of his offences, when they are separated from
deeds of benevolence that were carefully calculated
to bring him some future advantage. The bool;
contains various references to Bottomley’s connection
with John Bull, but it is obvious from the evidence
that the journal never amounted to a- prime preoccu-
pation with its founder.

Savage Supremacy
A Tribute from DICK ARNST.
Kangaroo Hunt, 1922
“THE P art y consisted of
-L three, and eight weeks

carried 32.40 Black Powder
Rifles, while I used a Savage

The total bag was 500 Kan-
garoos, to which my contribu-
tion was 360.
With this Rifle a good shot
can count on 80 per cent of his
bullets, and it is very rare that
he would have to use a second
shot.
To sum up, the Savage .22
‘Hi-Power’ is the best Rifle I
have ever used.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ich Dien.
To the immortal beauty am I bound;
All other service is but by the way:
To watch the dawn with children s eyes at
piay, _
Then the rich shadows on the sunburnt
ground;
To listen where the magic bush-joys sound
And hear the deep majestic heavens prav;
Then in the passing of the high, slow day
To tell the fire and pity I have found.
This is my labor till the years are dead,
And yet the hire men give is almost
naught;
They judge the song should be as free as
those
Divine enchantments that have strangely led
It forth. And so the singer’s life is
wrought
In bliss and sorrow no man ever knows.

To-morrow.
When my heart is strung to the highest key
Of joy, or sorrow;
When for Jove Life claims a greater fee
Than I dare borrow;
When back to Spain
Dreams fly again,
Soft a sandall’d maiden comes to me
Whisp’ring “To-morrow!”

The Silver Rider.
The sun has filled his stirrup-cup with wine
Of topaz lire, and on the mountain height
Rests one great moment ere with cloak
asbine
He turns his golden buckler to the west.
The sudden glory of his plumy crest
Flames on the world’s edge and is lost in
light.
So passed my silver dream of yesternight.
In the brown valley of a thousand trees
A little chapel sent an arrow-flight
Of happy music through the morning air,
Then fell to quiet and the murmurous
prayer
Of village faith that gazed on mysteries.
And, as I looked and listened, up the breeze
Came a shrill sound of laughter, and there
rode
A boy betwen the honeyed boughs where
bees
Drank the white cups of many-perfumed
spring.
His hair was like the yellow ministering
Of harvest angels where God’s high wains
load.
His fearless eyes with some far rapture
glowed,
~I*.m?srun fir prisoned mornings of no sun,
So full their light that all the white air
flowed
With diamond sparkles round him, and the
birds
In Orphean melodies of mystic words
Their fluttering webs of sound about, him
spun.
All the fresh morning odors seemed to run
From hedge and meadow with a greeting
fair.
Surely, his ride to fairyland begun,
Of all its fine green gates he held the keys
To open at a touch where’er he please
On shaven lawn or winding mossy stair!
His arms were silver, but his head was bare;
And from his lips there flowed a laughing
song,
Merry as golden tongues that beat the air
When high sounds shake the belfry for a
bride,
And the great windows of the church divide
Their colored lights in lances sweet and
long.
High in the saddle, beautiful and strong.
He passed me singing On his upward way.
I saw the happy trees about him throng,
The happy grass jn leaf and floating seed
Make a glad velvet for - his prancing steed
Where, exquisite as love, he crossed the day.
And then I saw him like a silver ray
Against the clear and very distant sky.
And mused beneath the branches where I
lay,
Making strange questioning of why and how.
My own pale hand felt cool upon my brow,
And some dark thing went murmuring, whis-
pering by.
In slow, rapt dreaming I was lifted high
Above the crystal pillars of the day
Into the stillness where in one great sigh
Is garnered knowledge of our toil and tears.
And I remembered that in silver years
My youth had passed with laughter that far
way.

Now I am done with love again
Regret lives in the heart o’ me:
But I am free from all love’s pain.
Yet when I loved, the kiss of rain
Was sweeter than it e’er can be
Now I am done with love again.
I gaze on beauty with disdain.
My heart is locked, and lost the key,
But I am free from all love’s pain.
At set of moon I look in vain
For that old flowering ecstasy,
Now I am done with Iqve again.
No sudden gold beats on ripe grain,
The eyes are blind that used to see:
But I am free from all love’s pain.
This foolish heart of mine would fain
Give quietude up for agony
Now’ T am done w'ith love again ;
But I am free from all love’s pain.

“The strike of miners on the Northern (N.S.W.) coalfield continues. The owners claim the right to discharge men who do not suit them; and to this the miners say
they will never agree.”
DISGUSTED MINER: “Here, Landlord, what do you call this? He’s only half-filling the glasses.”
LANDLORD: “Yes, I know; he’s become a teetotaller and is ruining my business, but what can I do? His union won’t let me sack him.”

SLOTH AND SELF-ADMIRATION.
“It is idle to talk of Queensland being ruined by
continued Labor rule. However fantastic are the
State Socialistic enterprises which Labor promotes,
Queensland is too rich a province to suffer irretriev-
ably. ...”
“When vve remember what Australia was 100 years
ago....\ye could say that in the lifetime of our
generation and the one which went before it, a miracle
had taken place. We had come from being the
dumping-ground of England’s flotsam and jetsam to
he a national equal to any other on the earth....
We had sent 400,000 men 12,000 miles from their
base. Even Napoleon himself never did such a
thing....We have tamed a continent. We have
more miles of railway than Britain herself, and
more miles per head than any other country in the
world. We have more sheep, more cattle per head
than any other country. Look at our commerce!
In the history of the world there has not been
such a wonderful development. The secret of all
this lies not only in the richness of our country
but in the qualities of our people—courage and self-
reliance.”
The first, quotation is, from the Sydney
Telegraph ; the second from a speech by
Hughes. The two combined represent a
disastrous and purely acquired trait in the
national character —one that is steering it
briskly, if not to destruction, certainly in
that direction. It is the belief that we are
not like other men, wherefore we need not
fear losing our political freedom, and that any
jealous care of it is waste effort; also, that we
need not worry about work, for work comes
naturally 'to us, as evidenced by the alleged
fact that we have already done more of it
than any other people who ever lived or are
ever likely to.
Queensland has just witnessed the spec-
tacle of party leaders who can win only a
smattering of seats on the municipal roll, and
only a seat or two on the Federal roll,
achieving something more than a mere vic-
tory when using their own roll and super-
vising the election themselves. The fact that
a great proportion of the voters on that roll
are people whom the Federal registrar has
failed to locate, and that there is apparently
nothing to prevent these mysteries consti-
tuting three-fifths of the pfirty vote next
time, certainly suggests that the people of
Queensland have had their self-governing
rights snatched while they weren’t looking,
and have no idea when they will get them
back. As regards the glad assurance that
no Government, however Red and bad and
mad, can “irretrievably” ruin an Australian
State, and especially the richest Austra-
lian State, it is satisfactory to reflect
that few things are quite irretrievable —'not
even a city paper which prints pictures of
a fertile country like- Mesopotamia, where
misgovernment lias made a desolation for
500 years or so. Still, the temporary irre-
trievableness embodied in 500 years of
calamity is something to lie avoided if pos-
sible. All that has happened to rich and
fertile and splendid Queensland so far under
the man who seems to have appointed him-
self a permanency is that it has acquired :
(1) Far the heaviest taxation per head in the
Commonwealth. (2) The second biggest debt per
head. (3) The smallest sinking fund. (4) The
largest percentage of unemployed. (6) The poorest
record for the number of new factories established
during Theodore’s reign—Tasmania had nearly three
times as many. (6) The poorest record for the num-
ber of new factory workers —Tasmania had over 10
times as many. (7) The smallest area under crop
among the mainland States. (8) The least payable
State railway system—it was the best of all in the
year before Theodore. (9) The greatest slump,
since 1917 anyhow, in mineral production. (10) A
poor fourth place among the six States for wages
paid per factory worker, though Queensland has an
unusually large percentage of males among its
workers. (11) Worst place among the States as re-
gards the proportion of the total value of factory
output which goes to the employee in wages. (12)
Worst place as regards the employee’s share of the
“added value”—that which labor adds to the origi-
nal cost of raw materials. (13) A declining contri-
bution to the Federal exchequer in income-tax, war-
profits tax and land-tax.
The total revenue of the Commonwealth in
1921 from its five direct taxes (probate, in+
come, land, amusements and war profits)
was £20,419,587. On a mean population
basis Theodore’s State might have been
expected to contribute £2,881,143. Despite
its gold and copper and sugar and cotton and
its herds of cattle, what it did contribute was
£1,051,334. The Beggar of the North lived
on everybody, even on little Tasmania.
Figures made out up to 1921 represented six
years of Theodoreism, and any change since
then has been for the worse. So when the
great man got a new lease of office the other
day and started out for another three years,
some people were anxious. It is plea.sing,
therefore, to have the assurance of even the
Telegraph that, owing to the peculiar and
remarkably boiler-plated constitution of the
Australian, there is nothing serious to fear,
and hardly anything even worth taking pre-
cautions against. Yet all the wreckage that
the Theodores have done has been achieved
with very limited powers. What if a similar
crowd achieved Federal office, with the army
and navy to back it if it took a fancy for
enlarged powers, and the tariff, the Com-
monwealth Bank, a debased coinage and an
unlimited note issue to play with ; also suf-
ficient ghostly voters to return it regularly
for 25 years ahead, or else with a “Red
Objective” franchise of the Soviet variety,
which would disqualify probable opponents,
and a brisk tendency towards republican
experiments? Such things are more than
merely possible. Yet the nation is instructed
to sloth along with perfect confidence!
* *■ # #
And it gathers naturally from Hughes,
who puts the same case another way, that
super-men of such achievement as ours don’t
require to take much thought for the morrow,
being fit for any old morrow when it comes.
It is all the sorriest fustian. Australia isn’t
“a national equal to any other on the earth”
except in the splendid individual courage our
handful of men have shown. We didn’t (that
is to say, Prime Minister Hughes didn’t)
perform the Napoleonic feat of sending
400,000 men 12,000 miles from their base.
They got there mostly in other people’s ships
and convoyed by other people’s ships. There
is very small satisfaction either in owning
a little more railway than a country less
than one-twentieth our size; and, as a matter
of lamentable fact, we don’t own any rail-
way at all —not a yard. It isn’t even owned
by preference shareholders in this country.
At latest figures (1921) the State railways
and tramways would be worth about
£245,000,000 if they paid full interest on
their cost, which they don’t, and if they were
brand new, which they aren’t. As w r e have
borrowed £297,000,000 to pay for them, in
a manner of speaking w T e really own
£52,000,000 worth less railway than we did
100 years ago when we owned no railway
at all. Nor does Australia possess “more
cattle per head than any other country.”
Harmless little places like Paraguay and
Uruguay beat us badly. Australia’s trade is
certainly remarkable, but it is childish to
talk of it in Hughes’s superlatives. In 1920
Australia’s total trade was exceeded by
Britain, Canada, the U.S., Argentina, Bel-
gium, France, Italy, Japan, Holland. Sweden
and Switzerland, and for trade per head this
country was behind Britain, Canada, Maori-
land, Belgium, Denmark, Holland, Norway,
Sweden and Switzerland. Again, a business
that consists so largely in sending out raw
materials that we might USe, and bringing
in finished goods that we might make, and
doing it with ships that we might build but
don’t, and paying largely with borrowed
money, isn’t the best kind of trade. The
Australians haven’t really “tamed” any con-
tinent, for the northern limit of effective
occupation is not very far from where our
British rulers left it when they abdicated
Over 60 years ago. It is doubtful if they
have even quite tamed the Sydney-Parra-
matta road despite all the loan money spent
on it. Yet Australia has something of such
marvellous quality that no other . country
can beat it. That is its Future, provided
brassy political impostors don’t utterly ruin
it, and its Opportunity, nrovided time-serving
spellbinders don’t fool it away.
THE CANT OF ARCHAISM.
“J.8.D.” on the distant dog that is always a
lion: —-
Can’t something be done to save us from our
archaists? An archaist is like a pacifist, with the
difference that whereas the pacifist disci edits his
country’s naval and military activities the archaist
does the same by his country' s literary and artistic
life.
Nothing more blatantly insincere has been pub-
lished of late years than the press eulogies of the
furniture and ornaments found in Tutankhamen's
tomb. Many of the Diggers saw in the Cairo Museum
replicas or near-replicas of every one of these articles.
The jewellers and furniture-makers of old Egypt did
not stray from the accepted models. They were in-
teresting, these relics of a dead civilisation, astound-
ing when one remembered they had first seen the
light of day more than 30 centuries ago. But listen
to this catalogue:—
An alabaster vase of exquisite workmanship.
A beautiful gem in an ivory box, amazingly deli-
cately painted with hunting scenes.
Restoration of the famous throne has revealed
in amazing and brilliant colors the figures of the King
and his Queen, in semi-opaque glass, chiefly of a
glorious deep red. The Queen s head-dress is of the
finest inlay in brilliant royal blue.
Then there was a “necklace with scarab pendant”
equal in “workmanship and design to anything modern
art can show” ; also: —
A massive inlaid ebony and ivory stool, with gold
mountings. The seat represents an animal’s skin,
thrown over the folding supports, ending in ducks’
hgads. It is a wonderful piece of artistic craftsman-
ship.
Necklaces and scarabs every bit as beautiful as any-
thing in the Cairo Museum (which is to say, very
similar to the ones discovered in Tutankhamen’s
tomb) are being unearthed continually from
the dishevelled ash-heap near Pierpont Mor-
gan’s villa on the other side of the Nile
from Luxor town. They are colorless and
clumsy gauds that might still look in place
on blaeks, but that no white woman of taste would
wear. Any Australian who has been to Pompeii will
have seen stools of similar design to, but of far finer
quality than, those of Egypt—the sella curules, which
the Roman magistrates used in Livy’s day. A modern
artisan would scorn to turn out such rough work.
How awkward would be the predicament of these
eulogists of the arts and crafts of 3000 b.c. if some-
one slipped in amongst the ancient treasures a neck-
lace of Queensland opals, or a piece of really finished
furniture made locally from one of our peerless hard-
woods ! Having exhausted their adjectives on scarabs,
crude wooden toys and clumsily-turned vases, the
archaists would he left dumb in the presence of
genuine beauty.
The swelling tide of Irish nationalism which re-
cently imposed on distracted Erin the obligation of
trying , to learn Gaelic induced simultaneously an in-
terest in early Irish history. As a result a number
of tribesmen, as ruthless in character as they were
insanitary in person, have been presented to the
world as historical figures of a high order of culture.
At the beginning of the Christian era the Irish were
a most bloodthirsty lot, and many were probably
cannibals. When we read that Tuathal Techtmab
(a.d. 130-160) was “a wise and mighty monarch”
who “built fortresses of great strength and beauty,”
we do not see a dirty and unshaven savage, bare-
footed, hatless and clad only in a brief shirt, toil-
ing with his family upon the construction of earthen
mounds for the protection of a cluster of beehive-
shaped wicker cabins with holes in the roofs to let
the smoke escape. Yet the native kings and their
strongholds were no more impressive than that. After
the conversion of Ireland by St. Patrick (and, inci-
dentally, many of his converts reverted to Druidism
immediately he died), we learn from present-day
poets that “splendid monasteries arose” and “learn-
ing spread like a summer fire.” The reader, being
denied details, imagines educational establishments
after the style of Oxford Colleges, whereas the most
illustrious of the Irish “monasteries” (Clonard in
Meath) was a collection of wattle-and-dab huts, built
and inhabited by peasants who fanned for a liveli-
hood and listened to sagas in their spare time. And
we may be sure that their teachers were concerned
chiefly to impress on them the beauty and poetry
of life in the palaeolithic age.
The wearisome old “Greek spirit” that resurges
periodically in every British community has been
hanging like a miasma over us for some time, and
in Sydney at the beginning of the .month it took
definite shape in “Vision, a literary quarterly.” The
editors are brilliant and versatile young men, which
makes it the sadder that their gifts should be wasted
on the glorification of Dionysos (this pedantic form
is characteristically preferred, and similarly we get
Theocritos, Olynipos, and so on), of Falernian
wine, and in general of anything that was in vogue
20 or 30 centuries ago. “We would seek,” proclaim
the editors in their “Foreword,” “to be as young as
Aristophanes” ; and that sentence epitomises the
humbug of their well-worn formula. They imagine
that because Aristophanes jeered he was young. He
was not, any more than those who joined in the
Bacchanalia were happy. Aristophanes was born old.
He was the immemorial Tory—the type who lives
in a past age, and mocks at reforms because they
were unknown to his grandfather. That Aristo-
phanes was a Tory of genius only serves to maKe
his complacent elderliness the more patent: the whole
intellectual movement of his day passed him by. The
insistence in Vision on the delights of the orgy (“it
is a favorite theme of mine....that Dionysos was
still the living god for all who sought to realise
self through Joy”) is merely a variation of the
superstition that makes the wooden horses of the
Egyptian kings things of beauty, and the illiterate
chieftains of fifth-century Ireland more inspiring char-
acters than Tim Healy or Edward Carson. The
Bacchic orgy (or, in plain words, collective drun-
kenness of a bestial nature conjoined with tribadism)
is repulsive to people who have mastered the art of
pleasure. It belongs to the lowest order of civilisa-
tion. The robber barons of the Dark Ages of Europe
and their retainers engaged in this melancholy and
brutish form of relaxation, and outbreaks of the sort
are said to have occurred in the U.S.A. since the
passing of the Volstead amendment; but, broadly, no
white man has “waved a thyrsus in a mountain revel”
since the early part of the second century b.c., when
Rome became too civilised for such ways. “Have
you any ambrosia such as we used to make on
Mount Ida?” asks a satyr of an Australian girl in
one of the Vision sketches; and then: —
At his direction Rose and I collected some bur-
gundy, a honey-jar, and petals of violet, daphne,
rose and apple and some poppy-seeds. These he
mingled together. “It should stand awhile,” he said.
“But I am too fain of it.” And he drank thirstily.
If this abominable mixture was swallowed by one of
our archaists it would certainly make him sick; just
as a Bacchic orgy would disgust him, and a day or
so of the intolerant conservatism of Aristophanes
exasperate him. The wines of ancient Greece are
well enough to write about on account of the beauty
Of their names, but for beverage purposes a. three-
shilling bottle of Australian claret or hock were un-
doubtedly preferable to the noblest Chian ever made.
It is enough to say that long after Livy’s day such
horrors as pitch, resin, sea-water, turpentine and
burnt shells were introduced into the best Greek
wines with the object of flavoring them or reducing
their acidity. The editors of Vision appreciate that
some apologia is needed for their fauns, nymphs,
satyrs and other shadows of shadows, and so we get
this piece of false reasoning:—
Poetry and the sister expressions must be liberated
from the shackles of local color and folic-tales, from
the peasantry or the drawing-room. Romeo can no
more exit into a back yard in Sydney than he could
into one in London ; he had to be localised at Verona,
where he was free as he would not otherwise have
been.
And yet Rosalind could exit with haunting effect into
a glade in the forest of Arden, which was as English
as the National Park is Australian. The explanation
of Shakspeare’s tendency to concentrate on foreign
lands and ancient times is that he was a business
man who found himself confronted with the veiy con-
ditions that threaten this country. It was the
fashion to be archaic in Elizabethan London, and
Shakspeare met the demand. When I was a small
boy Oscar Wilde and his school were writing about
the beauties -of Thasos and Chios, the wonder of a
summer sun gilding the slopes of Mitylene on Lesbos,
and all. the-rest of it, as Byron., and liis school had
done before them. Later I visited the isles of Greece,
and was amazed to find them not one whit more
beautiful than any other Mediterranean island. A
Sydneyite, by paying the modest railway fare to the
South Coast, may see more beauty in an hour than
he would find along the Greek coasts in a week. If
one of our passionate young archaists were told that
he might behold the original of the Vatican Gany-
mede, his excitement and gratification would be in-
tense, and yet on any Australian surf-beach he may
- find without the least trouble male forms as exquisite
as any that Praxiteles saw, and female ones as lovely
as the Melos Aphrodite. The highest form of flattery
Australian artists and writers can accord the ancients
is to do as they did—try to express in stone and
paint and words the innumerable beauties that are
around them. A genius is- handicapped by the effort
to present an unfamiliar period as faithfully as those
who lived in it: where a lesser man makes the attempt
he produces the undesirable effect of a circus clown
capering imitatively at the heels of the ringmaster.
THE BRITISH OR THE RUSSIAN
WAY?
It is only the normal child who, after being
burnt, dreads the fire: the moron forgets.
Mental deficiency of a like nature appears to
be the sole explanation of the fact that,
despite the dose of tyranny which Australia
was required to swallow during the wai
and for several years after it, there should
be people anxious to exchange our present
more or less free existence for that ol Jo
per cent, of the citizens of Russia. One oi
the most prized things that the Diggers sac-
rificed Avhen they volunteered was tneir
liberty. The soldier did not object to the
menace of drastic penalties for crimes which
would have earned him only mild punish-
ment if apy at all in civilian life, nor nail
he any complaints to make when called on to
face hardship and death in the field, 'that
he hated was the bureaucratic side of arm)
life —the arrogance of rank _ and the pett)
interferences with the details of his exist-
ence. Many still wince when they think or
such necessary controls as medical inspec-
tions. Hut or bivouac inspections were toler-
able or otherwise to self-respecting men
according as the officers and n.c.o. s hap-
pened to be gentlemen or. hogs. “We don t
go in for law in this brigade,” one A.l.f-
C.O. used to boast; “what we aim at is
justice.” In furtherance of this ideal he
and his adjutant succeeded in getting one
man sentenced to five years’ penal servitude
for refusing to be inoculated. The C-O. no
doubt believed this to be a just sentence, and
one calculated to assist in winning the war,
but it was not legal, and the victim and
many of his comrades knew it. Their resent-
ment was not lessened when a higher autho-
rity quashed the sentence, nor their scorn
of military methods.
Australia already approximates more
closely to the regimentation of the U-k-A-
than to the freedom of England. It has
always had a bigger proportion of unionists
per head of the population than any other
country. It is the same in other directions: JU
per cent, of our doctors belong to the B.M.A-.
In England the proportion is vastly less.
About one Australian in 12 is a civil servant.
Every bureaucrat, likes to prove himseli
worthy of his hire, and as one result the
first thing that impresses visitors from Brit-
ish cities to Australian ones is the number
of printed directions and inhibitions that the
hand of authority has nailed up everywhere.
Five-sixths of our strikes are caused d
bureaucrats, who feel shaky in their well-
paid jobs, working on the emotions of irre-
sponsible youths with the object of proving
that they—the bureaucrats —“have the in-
terests of the proletariat at heart.” Ihe. x '
S. Wales branch of the B.M.A. is being
taken to the Privy Council by a doctor whom
it recently boycotted for using, expressions
on the subject of certain unspecified doctors
methods, with suspected lunatics, expressiom
which anyone but a bureaucrat would hai
tactfully ignored; and similar high-handea
action has been attempted against a Tas-
manian doctor. Last week the editor or tn
Sydney Worker revdaled that the bureau-
crats of the A.L.P. had had the effrontery
order him to appear before them on a B}J
night and explain something he had written
about their organisation, or suffer the co
sequences. Such manifestations represe
justice in the opinion of the officials w
originate them, in the same sense as the
position of a sentence of five years for ret -
ing inoculation represented justice in
opinion of the C.O. above mentioned.
they are the chancy justice of the drag-net
section (40) of the Army Act. The fewe

war period, and the national . -
bureaucracy is certainly growing. "

This is the wa v of every Bed mona rc

arv with a monarchist. The autocrats may
think such methods constitute justice (though
oftener they are the expression _ot class
hatred, fear, jealousy or the to be
established in a menaced billet), but they are
not law. The British way, the constitutional
way, the only way endurable by a tree
nat'on was exemplified last week in the case of
Art O’Brien. O’Brien was not merely accused
of advocating revolut.on and republicanism.
Anyone is at liberty to do that in England,
“prov ded,” to borrow the phrase used re-
cently by the Home Secretary in the House
of Commons, “no breach ot the peace is
caused and the speeches do not advocate
direct violence.” Only last week a Scotch
Labor leader was allowed, with impunity, to
publicly call for the abolition of the mon-
archy. ‘ But O Brien was charged with
conspiring to arm persons in England against
the Free State Government. A Brit.sh Min-
ister ordered his deportation. Because
O’Brien was living under neither a Prussian
military nor a Russ an proletariat autocracy,
he was able to put the machinery of the law
into mot.on. His case went from the Appeal
Court to the House of Lords, and, the Lo”ds
deciding they had no jurisdiction, it came
back to the Appeal Court, which ruled that
his detention was unlawful and ordered him
to be brought back to England. Costs against
the Crown. No more inspir ng example
could be given of the British distrust of the
Continental droit administratif , or power of
a bureaucrat to enforce laws of li's own cre-
ation. There is nothing abnormal in this
desire to inflict drastic punishment on those
who, in the opinion of the bureaucrat, have
earned it. Most of us are disposed to de-
port our pet aversions first and try them
afterwards. Given the power a proh bition-
ist would do it to barmaids, an R.S.P.C.A.
member to a horse-torturer, a British Empire
League president to a disloyalist, and vice
versa. To obviate this tendency, to save
society from anarchy varied by the unfree-
dom of the life led by a soldier on active
service, to ensure that every unit of the
community shall have his rights and know
what they are, the British people have spent
a dozen centuries and oceans of blood. The
g'gantic and complicated legal and constitu-
tional machine which has resulted is as great
a boon in its way as the steam engine, or
antiseptic surgery or anaesthetics or any
other device of man to make the world more
comfortable. Bolshevism, or militarism. (for
they are the" same), the State ownership, of
everything, an army of officials functioning
under a handful of dictators —this system of
government, far from be'ng an advance on
the existing one, is a step back to the bloody
age when there was no law but only “jus-
tice,’* and when a supreme overlord decided
what justice was.
THE “MORAL” WAVE OF THE U.S.A.
We know Government hypocrisy in Austra-
lia as evidenced by Government attitudes to
to the totalisator, with
the moral uplifter and the bookmaker as
allies; prohibition of sweeps and lotteries,
with the Government accepting postal re-
venue for carrying tickets and levying taxa-
tion on the prizewinners. But never was
hypocrisy as blatant and unblushing in Aus-
tralia as it is in the U.S.A. PoLtieians
known to have cellars and to be lovers of
good wine ascend pulpits and shout that
Prohibition must be enforced; President
Harding, well known as a bon vivant, ad-
dresses church meetings on the necessity of
keeping the nation dry and pure. Except
for the honest men who admit that they
drink a little wane for the stomach’s sake
and are absolutely opposed to Prohibition,
the legislatures' are stuffed with hypocrites
whom even the failure of Prohibition cannot
cure of spell-binding. They still rave that
alcohol shall be unknown on “God's Green
Footstool” (the U.S.A.), that “our peniten-
tiaries shall become deserted wildernesses,
our county gaols shall close, and American
men and women shall join in Te Deum to the
Lord of Holies for the new and blessed life
brought to us by Prohibition.” The fact
thai the gaols are overcrowded, and serious
crime increasing everywhere, is nothing to
the hypocritical uplifter. The Illinois Bank-
ers’ Association states that bank _ hold-ups
have increased from 15 in 1916, with losses
of 30,000 dollars, to 32 in 1018, with losses of
179,000 dollars, and to 119 attacks in 1919,
with losses of 807,000 dollars. That is one
concrete case which illustrates the general
condition.
There is one uplifter in, the Federal House
of Representatives, Upshaw, of Georgia,
who is honest—if he is not only out for pub-
licity. Upshaw is a cripple with a history
of brave effort. When 18 he suffered spinal
injury and was seven years bedridden as
the result. From lecturing proceeds he en-
tered Mercer University at 31; he was active
in the campaign which made Georgia a Pro
hibition State in 1907, and was a paid
speaker for the Anti-Saloon League and the
W.C.T.U. This gentleman now publicly de-
mands that the Pres'dent and his Cabinet
shall “walk out in the open and lift their
hands before High Heaven and make a new
oath of allegiance to the whole Constitution.”
What he really wants is an oath of allegiance
to the 18th amendment. Somebody mi’ht
demand that Mr. Upshaw should take the
oath of allegiance to the 11th and 15th
amendments, which give the negro that elec-
toral equality he has never been permitted
to exercise, especially in Georgia, which is
one of the States that burn the negro at
the stake while assuring him that he has all
the rights of an American citizen. But
national hypocrisy has long agreed to leave
the negro-enfranchising amendments the dead
letter the Prohibition amendment is fast be-
coming.
A different reformer is thp Rev. Harry
Bcgert. o' F St. M’chael’s, Birdstone. He
says: “If the Prohibition law were abolished
to-day it would take more than a generation
to wipe out the evil results. Where in my
youth we swapped marbles and jack-knive=,
'young boys and girl now swap receipts for
making liquor with a kick in it.”
The highly-salaried moral uplifter of
America is more intolerant than the ear’y
Amer’can Puritans who left the Old World
to find religious liberty. Yet even tbev d’d
not stand for interference in tastes of f"od r r
drink. They imprisoned tobacco-smokers and
women who showed their elbows, flommd
Sabbath-breakers, burned witches, sc urged
Quakers, Adamites and heretics, and sen-
tenced to death any child over 16 years of
age who cursed his father or any son who
was “stubborn and rebellious.” Yet “for
convenience of worshippers” they built the
tavern next the church. They upheld the
death penalty for any who should “have or
worship any other god than the Lord God,”
and they had penalties for making mincepies,
dancing, cardplaying, playing music, cross-
ing the river, running, walk.ng in one’s gar-
den, travelling, cooking, making beds, sweep-
ing houses, haircutting, shaving, or kissing
wife, husband or child on the Sabbath. The
d g that barked on Sunday was to be beaten.
Naturally, such laws, setting up an impos-
sible standard of conduct, failed, and in tneir
failure brought contempt for even such laws
as are reasonably obeyable. As _n those days
so in these, one impossible law caused out-
breaks of reasonably preventable crimes.
Surviving with the fact of that law is the
survival in America of the belief that man
can make himself good by making it a crime
to be bad. Almost all law is unwritten,
and the criminal law is a very small factor
in lceepirg the world clean. The force of
human affection and loyalty to the c mmu-
nity, self-respect and good manners, is greater
than the mere fact of gaol.
It was apparently the American Republi-
can’s revolt against the oppression of Puri-
tan government that caused the U.S. Gov-
ernment in its treaty with Tripoli in 17G6
to declare that “the U.S.A. is not n ary
sense founded on the Christian reLg on."
In the same way it had had so much t o
much of parson government that the new
States specifically excluded clergymen from
the holding of any State office. They had
had enough of ferocious laws that whipped
and bored with hot irons the tongue of any
man who doubted the Bible or any part of
it; they were weary of the drunken parsons
who branded as a criminal any man who
refused to pay tithes; weary of laws that
used soldiers to whip people to church. Even
the law against organised murder has now
so far failed in the southern States as to
render necessary the introduction of Federal
legislation to make lynching and burning of
negroes and others illegal.
The passion for legislating the obvious
had its best expression in a Western Sta e
legislature, one of whose statesmen intro-
duced a bill providing penalties for viola-
tion of any of the Ten Commandments. His
bill began, after the usual preTmble: “Whoso
shall have another God shall be fined one
hundred dollars.” He did not define P e
God he meant,, and as his bill was defeated
it doesn’t matter. But he was a beacon
light to all legislators forever. One of his
clauses read: “Whoso shall covet his neigh-
bor’s house, his wife, nis manservant, his
maidservant, jfis ox or his ass shell be
fined according to the enormity of the
offence.” How external evidence of “covet-
ing” was to be read or defined the Western
statesman did not trouble to state. He is
worth mentioning as an illustration of fie
reactionary desire of fanatics the world over
to bring the churches and the church influ-
ence back into civil government, and to rule
good and tolerant citizens in the spirit of
the old New England Sabbath.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Cocky in Queensland.
■Not the least significant happening in
Queensland on May 12 was the strong vote
polled by the sorely-tried Country party.
There was a time when it looked probable
that the Cookies would form the next Gov-
ernment, but during the last 12 months
everything has gone against them. A plot
engineered in Brisbane resulted in eight
members seceding to the lamentable United
party. The Redistribution of Seats Bill,
which wiped out three Cocky electorates and
made four or five more look difficult, was
another heavy blow. Then Theodore came
along with the scheme of agricultural co-
operation he had borrowed from the Farmers'
Un'on. With that and the redistribution as
weapons he did his best to slug the Cockles
out of existence. Next to winning the election,
the gaining of seats like Burrum, Burnett,
Nanango, Carnarvon, Cunningham and Mur.lla
was the object nearest his heart. Daily-
paper critics were surprised when he did
most of his campaigning in country consti-
tuencies to the neglect of urban electorates
which were supposed to be in danger. But
Theodore knew what he was about. Unlike
the writers of hogwash about “the need for
unity of action against the common enemy,’’
he realises that Cockyism is the most formid-
able of obstacles to the Success of his party,
in both State and Federal politics. Labor
has regained nearly all its old metropolitan
voters who drifted away from it during the
war years, but it hasn’t won back the thou-
sands of farmers who used to vote Labor
when the only alternative was a city-bossed
“Liberalism” or “Nationalism.” Perhaps
two-fifths of the Country party vote is pro-
vided by these exH.aborites. 'That is why the
Agrarians win Federal seats like Maranoa
(Q), Darwin (Tas.), Riverina (N.S.W.),
Indi (Vic.) and Gippsland (Vie.), which used
to be fairly safe for the blue and white.
Theodore’s attack on their Queensland
branch would have destroyed it if the tree
hadn’t been sound at the root. He dug up
some excellent candidates, stumped the coun-
tryside on their behalf in a most energetic
fashion, made the most of his cotton guar-
antee and the co-operative organisations he
had called into existence, and worked the
advantages the redistribution of seats gave
him for all they were worth. Moreover, in
all the qualities of leadership he head
and shoulders above the uninspiring Vowles.
But notwithstanding all his exertions, tins
part of his campaign, so successful in other
respects, must be written down a failure.
All bis gains except Murilla were m"de at
the “Nationalists’ ” expense, and the MuriFa
win was due to a here-to-day-and-gone-to-
morrow railway gang which voted 100 to 6
in the Labor man’s favor. Badly led, w;th-
out journalistic backing, a prey to Labor
attacks. “Nationalist” intrigues and internal
dissension, the Country party yet survives,
to be a force in the next Parliament. In
fact. May 12 supports the belief, born of
December 16. that Labor and Cocky are the
only two parties w : th a future. Which is
not to say’that the Agrarians won’t have to
broaden their scope and change their unim-
pressive name.
Child Labor.
When Dunn was heaved to the post of N. S.
Wales Parliamentary Labor leader, he cele-
brated the occasion with a declaration of
policy, which included this feature: —
The Act urgently heeds amending so that protec-
tion may be given 'to adult workers from the growing
principle of flooding an industry with juvenile
workers.
There seems almost an excess of anxiety lest
the boy should learn an occupation at which
he can earn something in later life towards
the interest cn the b;g debt which the old
man leaves him. The “child-labor” figures
(available up to 1921) are interesting, the
official "child ’ being in South Aus. someone
over 13 ; in (Queensland, N. S. Wales and Tas-
mania someone over 14; and in Victoria art]
Westralia a boy over 14 or a girl over 15,
the very small girl being humanely barred
in those States. The figures showed a de-
crease in the number of child workers in
N. S. Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, and
a decrease of 201 in the Commonwealth, as
compared with 1920. The only State which
showed a substant al increase was Queens-
land, which had 145 more “factory kids'’ in
1921 than the year before. After all, only
485 per 10,000 factory workers were “chi’d-
ren” in 1921, aga list 484 per 10,000 in 1910,
so there seems little for Dunn to grow ex-
cited over. And this point is worth c n-
sideration: just 10,408 male “chi’dren,” being
a small but undefined number of appren.ices
and the rest oddments, were learning to re-
place their 281/92 male elders when they
ceased toil, and to meet the demand for
14,500 extra male workers each year to man
the new industries that are springing up.
That is the number required according to the
average of the previous four years. The
figures create the impression that the out-
look for Australian industry is poor and
mostly dependent on imported labor, and that
a regrettable number of our own 16-year-olds
are being steered towards a life of odd-job-
bery, the lower forms of “sport” and crime.
Two things are not likely to be f rgiven to
those responsible, either in this world or the
next, assuming ('which would be just
their bad luck) that there is a next.
One is that, while spendng as much
as they could of the children’s heritage, they
left Posterity a vast burden of unproductive
debt incurred to pander to the'r own appe-
tite for easy times and good living. The
other is that, with a besotted idea of making
skilled industrv the old man’s monopoly,
.though he couldn’t take it to the grave with
him, they did their best to beoueath <-o Pos-
terity an untrained, casual mind and a use-
less pair of hands.
The Political Thieves’ Kitchen.
When the State Premiers were compiling
programmes for their conference with the
Federal P'rime Minister, and making rough
estimates as to how much they could steal
from him and each other and the general
public, it was inevitable that Tiieodoke
should be there with his demand that the
States in general—the Commonwealth, in
fact —should make his State a present of a
very large and costly railway. The Com-
monwealth has contracted to build a line
from'South to North; South Australia paid
for it in advance when it handed over
334,600,000 unsold acres, stipulating that in
return a line should be built on a fixed and
prescribed route to Darwin. The price
(about 200,000 acres per mile of line) was
extraordinary, seeing that the highest price
ever previously paid for land-grant railways
in Australia was 12,000 acres per mile, and
considering that much of it is quite good
land. The rotten uses that the great estate
has been put to don’t prove that the soil is
bad, any more than the fact of the inheritor
of a golden fortune drinking himself to death
shows that the sovereigns were counterfeit.
As for the folly of handing over the payment
without security, the South Australians can
only plead that they were dealing with
Alfred Deakin, and they were simple
enough to think that the matter would
always be in the hands of Alfred Deakins.
The Queensland Premier offers no land-grant
or other payment. He merely demands, as
a recognition of his own merits, or his State’s
services to the Commonwealth, or something,
that Australia shall disregard its contract
and make a longer and more costly line, and
leave the best part of its own great estate un-
developed in order to do so. As a news-
paper report blandly put the case (17/5/’23) :
Mr. Theodore said that he regarded it as the
gravest blunder the Commonwealth could make to
build a railway involving £12,000,000 to
£15,000,000 across the desert to the North. There
seemed to-be no alternative but to deviate the line
through Queensland to the N. S. Wales border, and
so give direct connection between Darwin, Brisbane,
Sydney, Melbourne ard Adelaide.
Such a line would no more touch Adelaide
than it would Hobart or London, but it
sounded gracious to mention the place. But
what special service has Queensland ren-
dered to the Commonwealth that it should
be granted fawns at the cost , and expense
of its neighbors? The answer really depends
on the contribution which the Northern State
makes to the common fund. There are five
headings under which the yield of the uni-
form Federal tax in each State is shown in
the Federal “Year Boot,” the figures being
for 1921 —land, income, probate, war profits
and amusement taxes. The results are in-
structive :* —

The Victorian figures are an exaggeration,
for some casual revenue which should be
credited to other States drifts into “Central
Office” there. All the other States lose a
little this way, and probably the losses are
about on a par. It is just possible that, if
these sums were credited where they belong,
South Australia would be the best contri-
butor, while Queensland would certainly re-
main the second worst. On the figures as
they stand S' uth Australia pays £45.596 a
year above its share, and Queensland pays
over £1.229.000 belcw its proper quota. If
the net postage revenue is added to the cal-
culation (or deducted in Westralia’s case,
there being less than nothing to add) the
position is only altered a trifle: —

Tasmania is a small child of misfortune which
asks for little and gets less. But the other

applicants for aids and concessions, and their
general attitude almost hints that their hard-
working neighbors owe them a debt of grati-
tude.

Queensland Fascismos.
Dear Bulletin, —To the strictly forensic
nund there is nothing commendable in a
Fascist revolt. It is lawlessness, and the
fact that it opposes lawlessness of another
is no jusuncaUon. The sheet-anchor oi
Anglo-Saxon peoples is their deification of
the Constitution and Constitutionalism. So
it is not to be wondered at that the Brenners
who openly cheered Mussolini’s coup
d’etat should have their knuckles rapped
for then' antinonuan tntnus.asms. _ i>nt
Fascism, in the sense of a levoit or the
decent citizens to do their own governing,
has made periodical appearances in all coun-
tries when a vinous or an effete Govern-
ment has been in power, and its activities
have often been as necessary and beneficial
as they have been unconstitutional. “Direct
action in politics is the equivalent of the argu-
mentum ad JJaculum in log.c ; permissible on
occasion, when dealing with a fool or knave,
but wholly reprehensible as a habit or policy.
Australia lias liad its Fascist affairs, but
they have been limited in scope and dura-
tion. Queensland had a small concern of
the sort in the summer of 1919-20. Charle-
ville (YV.Q.) had become the home of. the
thugs, “heads” and prison sweep.ngs of,
tfie Cities, and the gentle art of separating
every diover and stockman from h.s cheque
was in full operation and highly organised.
The stock-in-trade of these gentry ranged
from the innocent double-header to the primi-
tive sandbag. The authorised custodians of
the Law walked largely and openly at these
doings, confining their profess-onal duties to
the .harmless chunk, w-th special reference,
so the town believed, to returned soldiers. A
storm of c.vic protest crystallised into the
recruiting of a small Fascist army, mainly
returned soldiers, under one Bolingbboke,
an ex-major of the A.I.F. On a day ap-
pointed these men fell in on a marker,
formed fours, and set out to clear the town
of the ■ undesirables. The process was
smartly and effic ently carried «"t. "nd. on
the whole, with commendable restraint. The
police force teen arose in ii ,ht(.ous indigna-
tion, and Bolingbboke and Russell (his
lieutenant) were committed to stand their
trail as maieiactors. Further to justify
authority, Mr. Fiiielly had a posse of
police sent to Oharleville, ostentatiously
carrying .303 rifles and ball ammunition. The
net result of this display was that, on the
eve of the trial, over 0100 ex-sold.ers, sta-
tion-hands, drovers and indignant citizens
of all sorts were standing to arms, from
Cunnamulli to Roma, w ; tli hors» and rfle,
to ensure the liberty of the Fascist leaders.
A citizens’ jury, however, gave a most un-
lawful verdict of “Not guilty” without leav-
ing the court, to the complete content of all
good westerners. The job done, each Fas-
cist went his peacable ways and the wound
in the Constitution healed rapidly. A some-
what similar situation existed recently in
the Cloncurry district, where stock-owners,
despairing of police action against cattle-
thieves. formed their own body of troope ; rs
and judiciary. Such little bursts of Fascist
sp rit are inevitable under the type of gov-
ernment which does not conduce to efficient
protection of civic rights. But this, of
course, is a matter very different from Mus-
solini’s idea of a settled policy to seize
the reins of government and squelch all
opposition. In •bis, case, it G an adroit use
of a popular reaction to establish the decay-
ing power of the nobility and Vatican in the
face of a growing democratic modernism. —

An Instalment of Uniform Gauge.
The worst thing said about the BrUCE-Page
Government so far is the announcement by
W. M. Hughes that it is doing exactly the
work he would have done himself if lie had
been left in power. The proposed duplicate
East-to-West railway really lends a tinge of
color to the alarming remark. The new men
have taken the easy course of deciding that
the question of a uniform railway gauge is
too large a one to tackle in the present state
of the finances. Now, the question is not a
flannel article which will shrink if left out
in the rain. Instead, it grows many miles
bigger every year owing to new construction
—out of loans. And the state of the finances
won’t become better through the mere pass-
age of time ; in fact, when the country has
finished borrowing the proposed £45,000.000
it is likely to be much worse. But the half-
measure proposal that the Commonwealth
should build some 600 or 700 miles of rail-
way, that there may be a continuous 4ft.
BHn. line from Kalgoorlie to Brisbane (or
Perth to Brisbane if the W.A. Government
can be reminded sufficiently hard of its obli-
gation to standardise its 373 miles of narrow-
gauge “transcontinental”), is open to six
major objections and some minor ones, (1)
It will open up no new port. (2) It will
develop no Federal territory, and the Com-
monwealth has 523.620 sq. miles there f wait-
ing to have something done with it. (3)
Most of the State land thereabouts is dry
and ordinary. (4) The whole work and the
whole £8 000.000 of expense lie inside that
line which every Government seems afra’d
to cross —the one from a little above Bris-
bane to a little above Perth, south of which
lies a mere one-fifth of the continent. (5)
The proposed route, via Wentworth and Hay,
even if it kept as straight as such a thing
could do, would be much longer and more
costly than the one via Broken Hill, (6)
The ' suggested work doesn’t attempt to be
even as straight as it might be. It deserbes
four or five curves so that it may take in
Morgan, Ren mark, Wentworth. Euston, Ral-
ranald and Oxley, and the idea of addi-g
mdes and miles to one of the world’s gvoat
railways in order that the European mails
may go round by Balranald and Oxley ap-
peals superfluous. But if the Bptjce- p, ge
Government seeks to be strong and original

old debt from Westralia. That State, when
it was presented with its •‘transcontinental.”
. undertook to convert its Petth-Kalgoorlie
section to the 4ft. Biin. measurement, and
prov.de a clear run from Port Augusta to
the Indian Ocean. There is little question
of the ability of the Golden State to fulfil
this engagement, but its rulers seem to have
got into the German habit of premeditated
poverty, and wear old clo’ to arouse sym-
pathy. Westralia has a real sinking fund,
which amounts to more than the oth r five
funds put together. The fund is so embedded
in the Constitution that all attempts to stop
contr butieus or to lay hands on the glitter-
ing pile have failed. So the local politicians
proceeded to express their feelings by the
cultivation of deficits, of which there have
been 11 consecutively, State taxation being
kept low that the shortage might be sure.
These are the records: —
Westralian Finance.
1911- Deficit, £134,409. Taxation per head
lower than Tasmania.
1912- Deficit, £190,404. Taxation lower than
Tasmania.
1913- Deficit, £135,411. Taxation reduced and
lower than N. S. Wales, Queensland, S. Australia
and Tasmania.
1914- Deficit, £567,817. Taxation reduced
again, and lower than all other States, and ss. 4(1.
per head below average of the six States.
1915- Deficit £348,223. Taxation below all
other States, and 7s. 4d. per head be’ow average.
1916- Deficit, £699,757. Taxation below all
other States, and 10s. lOd. below average.
1917- Deficit, £705,743. Taxation below all
other States, and 10s. 6d. per head below average.
1918- Deficit, £652,014. Taxation lower than
N. S. Wales, Queensland, S. Australia and Tasmania,
and 6s. 6d. below average.
1919- Deficit, £668,224. Taxation below
Queensland, S. Australia and Tasmania, and 2s. 4d.
below average.
1920- Deficit, £686,726. Taxation below N. S.
Wales, Queensland, S. Australia and Tasmania, and
9s. 6d. below average.
1921- Deficit, £732,135. Taxation below N. S.
Wales, Queensland, S. Australia and Tasmania, and
about 11s. 6d. below average.
Westralia is so rich in sources of revenue that
even with the lowest taxation it has always
the largest revenue in proportion to popu-
lation, and its spendings are magnificent.
A uniform gauge is obviously a desirable
thing, and the Kalgoorlie-Pertti section looks
a good ph.ee to begin—strictly at Westralia’s
charge. The Golden State may have been
wait ng to have the work done for it at
Commonwealth expense; but disappointment
is the lot of everybody here below.
Police Methods and Evidence.
By direction of the N. S. Wales Attorney-
General a barrowload of justification for the
offensive remarks occasionally offered by The
Bulletin about the attitude of Judges and
magistrates towards the admission of state-
ments “made by the accused, y’Onor,” was
wheeled into the Court of Criminal Appeal last
week. It was all about a man named Desmond,
a constable, a confession and a verd.ct of
guilty. The essential facts are that on the
Northern Circuit recently Desmond, charged
with breaking and entering, was arraigned
before Judge Mccatta. A confession
allegedly made by the accused to the arrest-
ing constable was tendered as evidence —and
Desmond went along for a diet of hominy
and a course of early rising. Eater the
Judge received from the Police Department
a communication stating that it had reduced
the aforesaid Hop in rank for extorting the
confession by threats and violence. The
horrified Mccatta immediately wrote to the
Crown Law authorities, pointing out (1)
that there was no evidence connecting Des-
mond with the offence charged against him
except the alleged Confession, and (2) that
the time was ripe for giving Justice a chance.
Having heard the horrible story, the Judges
of Appeal reversed the finding of the jury,
entered a verdict of acquittal, and ordered
Desmond’s release. There may be reasons
for retaining the jaunty Hop in the service
of the State. They were not mentioned in
court. Nor was it mentioned why he had
not been prosecuted. Possibly the glad tid-
ings are being kept until Parliament meets,
for there are certain to be then many ques-
tions on the subject. Meanwhile, the prac-
tice of admitting statements purporting to
have been made by accused persons, implica-
ing themselves in crimes of various descrip-
tions, will, of course, continue in all its old
rottenness. To allow in evidence any state-
ment made by one accused of a crime unless
he has been warned that anything he might
say could be used against him, that he need
not say anything, and that he had nothing
to hope or fear from being either communi-
cative or dumb, is an abuse of the law. It
is also an incentive to nerjury and worse. To
permit, as N. S. Wales benches do, police-
men to detail conversations with accused
persons before they have been charged, in a
technical sense, is just as bad. Juries are
not perfect; but they frequently know quite
a lot: and when they drop this sort of evi-
dence and go on the facts—well, they, are
not wrong probably more than once in a
hundred times. Desmond had the bad luck
to be among the 1 per cent.
The Day of the Oaf.
On a lorry, half-a-dozen young men, made up
apparently to represent prostitutes, jazzed
uncertainly, smoked and flung clumsy badi-
nage at the grinning crowd. The procession
halted for a moment, and one of the man-
girls leered towards a silver-badge wearer.
‘‘Say, D.g, givvus a feg,” he said. The ex-
sold.er turned away. “Thank God,” he
observed to the crowd in general, as the tide
of self-conscious buffoonery flowed on again—
“thank Gcd I was never at a university!”
Perhaps he imagined that all univers.ties are
like this. As a matter of fact, they are not
—outside Australia. Sydney’s undergrads,
on last week’s form, have not a hundredth
part the restraint and dignity of the hum-
blest artisan who participates in an Eight
Hour Day procession. But whatever their
manners may be, they presumably claim to
constitute the intelligentsia of the State, and
this is where the matter is of public interest.
A university is not primarily a place where
young men go to pass examinations and get
degrees. Its most important function is to
act as a radiating centre of the nation’s cul-
ture. Most of our universities on tile only
occasion when they appear before the public
behave in such a way that it takes tin
THE UNWILLING RECRUIT.
“Before the Federal Parliament meets the Nationalist and Country party members will hold separate
meetings, when the question of forming one camp wi I come up for consideration. Country party members
feel that if they and the Nationalists meet as a composite body they would be submerged by reason of
their limited voting strength.”

hoi polloi the rest of the year to recover
from the shock. The misguided lads, realis-
ing that some excuse is needed, protest (1)
that they are young, and (2) that their
antics amuse the onlookers. But (1) much
of their humor is not that of youth but of
sophisticated and dirty-minded age, and (2)
the fact that the lower and more brainless
elements laugh is only to say that they are
what they are: most of them would laugh
even louder if the men-girls were more
obscenely vulgar. These processions are
growing bigger and more offensive in most
of the States every year. In Tasmania a
few weeks ago the Governor took a strong
stand against those responsible for one of
them, and that is what will have to be done
by the University authorities elsewhere un-
less the highest educational institutions we
have are to repel rather than attract the in-
telligence of the community.
Our Trade with the Islands.
These are the short and shabby facts about
Australia s thrown-away Pacific Islands
trade. In 1916 practically the whole of the
copra exported from the islands was shipped
through Sydney or used there. In 1922 70
per cent, of that copra was being sent from
the islands direct to oversea countries, and
Sydney is handling now probably a good deal
less than the other 30 per cent. This is the
directly ident.fiable consequence of the policy
of discouragement pursued by the Common-
wealth and N. S. Wales Governments and
Sydney Harbor Trust, and of the business
blindness of all three. Australian tax inter-
preters ruled that all island produce sold in
Australia was taxable, 5 per cent, of the gross
proceeds being taken as the assessable in-
come ; and the amount payable to the Federal
squeezer was raised and raised so that it
grew from Is. MU d. in the £ in 1916 to 2s. 6d.
in 1919, the State tax remaining at Is. 3d.
The producer or exporter also has to pay
an export tax, and naturally tired of being
fined on both sides. Then the Harbor Trust
imposed some hasty and foolish regulations
against the storage of copra in Sydney Har-
bor, on the ground that it made a daily habit
of setting fire to itself. That hit the con-
signee and shipper here, already badgered by
the producer’s threats to send his stuff where
he and it would get better treatment. In
time evidence as to San Francisco’s free
handling of copra and of the stupidity of the
idea that invariably copra burst into flames
on its own account convinced even the Har-
bor Trust, which modified its thick-skulled
restrictive regulations almost out of exist-
ence —when the damage had been done and the
island trade with foreign countries was in full
swing. Meantime the Commonwealth Govern-
ment stuck its own knife into the trade by send-
ing its steamers to Fiji to take cargoes of
produce thence to other countries —and away
from Australia in Australian-owned boats!
That evil practice collapsed only recently be-
cause Fiji, which was paying a subsidy for
the service, found that there were buyers
oversea who would provide shipping without
any subsidy, and were glad enough to get the
business. Also, when it was too late, harbor
charges and freights were reduced, though
not sufficiently to bring the trade back to
this side. It is estimated that if the islands
did most of their business w ith Australia, as
they were do.ng until they were driven off
our market, employment would be given to
about 5000 men here. And there has to be
added to that the business that our indus-
tries would do with the islands in supplying
them with manufactures, food and their other
necessities. As things have been done —or
undone—the islanders naturally buy where
they sell, and it is a fact that in some parts
of the Pacific they import from England
tinned flour, doubtless made from Australian
wheat, and meat, which in all piobabiLty
came originally from Queensland. Also, and
as naturally, they have acquired a deep and
dark dislike for Australia, the country of
which, with good reason, they expected so
much, but which in effect has boycotted them.
Bonar Law, Britain’s “safety first” Prime
Minister, resigned on Monday in face of an
incurable disease of the throat —similar
apparently to that which accounted for the
ex-Kaiser’s father. He leaves a gap that no
statesman in sight can quite fill. Business-
like, reasonable, unspectacular and scrupu-
lously honest, he was as ideally suited for
the reconstruction period following on the
World War as his fellow Scot Campbell
Bannerman was to compose the differences
created by the South African tragedy. He
had not a fraction of Balfour’s charm or
intellectuality ; he never thrilled an audience
like Lloyd George, or coined a phrase to
equal the humblest in Winston Churchill’s
glittering collection, or understood the art of
rousing a party to frenzy like Carson. But
the British have grown uneasy about their
geniuses in the last half-dozen years.
Bonar Law was something very like a medi-
ocrity ; the people felt they could understand
and trust him, and in that lay the appeal
he made to the nation’s worried heart which
was his chief source of sti’ength.
“Sammas” adds a few points to the Zionist
controversy:—
The statement that wealthy Jews have no desire
to live in or even to visit Palestine is perfectly true.
Let me go further. These Jews are not going to
Palestine because they are not wanted there. The
work of reconstruction is so vast that only a limited
number of Jews are allowed entry annually. If 100
rich Jews living in freedom and security decided to
settle in Palestine, then 100 Jewish refugees in the
heart of the pogrom regions would automatically be
condemned to remain indefinitely in the stricken
areas. What the rich Jews are doing is to provide
mi'lions of pounds for intensive land cultivation, the
building of houses, schools and roads, a sound irriga-
tion scheme and the general deve’opment of the
country. This doesn’t sound like the dream of an
vdealogue, but more like keen, hard statesmanship
and breadth of vision.
The Bulletin remarks that the Jews have no right
to send the Arabs out of their own country. The Arabs’
country is Arabia. The Chinese have more right to
Australia than the Arabs have to Palestine, because
our celestial friends have at least cultivated portions
of the land for vegetable-growing, whereas the Arabs
for centuries have permitted rich and fertile lands
to remain sterile, though apathy, ignorance, neglect
and downright cussedness.
During its present state of transition, the move-
ment will have no lack of detractors, but
when the organisation is complete, when Jewish
migrants are flowing to their traditional homeland
in a steady stream, and when the irritating Arab 1
problem is solved by the great Powers, the world
may get a shock. The Jews are immune to criticism
and even slander. Hundred of years of it have
thickened their skins. But it were far better to
slander them ten thousandfold than to rob them of
their most precious ideal—an ideal that has kept
them indissolubly bound together for 20 centuries.
“Country Ped” : Alex. Peacock, Vic.
Minister for Education, explaining why new
schools are so slow in arriving, despite the
large sums annually voted for their con-
struction, pointed out that one school was
estimated to cost about £9OOO, and the lowest
tender received was £15,000. There is so
much of this sort of thing, he says, that
building has to be delayed while fresh ten-
ders are called. But the fault seems ,to be
largely with the Public Works Department,
of which the same Peacock is Ministerial
head. The system there is to call tenders
for a month. If fresh tenders have to be
called, another month is wasted in re-adver-
tising. I know a school for which tenders
for repairs were called nearly 12 months ago.
Twice they were rejected as excessive, simply
because the draughtsman in the head office
had added things the P. W. inspector who
made the estimate had not allowed for, which
meant the compilation of a fresh estimate.
The successful tender was accepted last
November. The contractor paid a visit in
April. He hasn’t been seen since; he has
too many other school contracts to occupy
him. Is there any valid reason why the
two departments concerned shouldn’t arrange
a system of travelling repairers for the
schools? A motor-van for camping and
carrying tools, a motor-lorry to carry tim-
ber from the railway, and three men would
do repair jobs in one-eighth the time this
tendering and contracting business takes.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Prime Minister Bruce’s whispered pro-
posal of a 3 p.c. sinking fund has been re-
ceived with enthusiastic silence. But as the
Government claims above all things to want
to move on business lines, it must
battle for a fund to wipe out loans
that are not represented by tangible assets.
Australia’s bad habit of neglecting sinking
funds on the pretext that the borrowed
money is represented by productive works
won’t serve in this Commonwealth case—
nine-tenths of the money isn’t represented by
anything that can be seen or smelt or fallen
over in the dark.
The trouble at Newcastle (N.S.W.) con-
tinues, threatening almost every other Aus
Italian industry, without much recognition
of what is really the matter. The miners, f>r
instance, insist that it is utterly impossible
to agree to the owners having the right to
dismiss any man they don’t want. They pro-
fess to see in this a deep-laid plot to put all
their militants out of work. Questions of
that sort don’t touch the basic difficulties at
all. What is really the matter on the N.S.W.
Northern coalfields, and Newcastle in particu-
lar, is that the demand is erratic, and at least
twice as many men are employed as would
be necessary if the mines were worked regu-
larly, six days a week, like gold- or silver-
mines. . Wfien the demand is erratic in other
industries stocks are accumulated; for in-
stance, the oil cos. provide large reservoirs
It is alleged—though it has never been satis-
factorily proved—that coal cannot be stored
largely at surface, on account of deteriora-
tion. The point ought to be settled once ard
for all. If it can’t be done, and if instead of
storing coal it is necessary to maintain re-
serves of workmen, then the maintenance of
those workmen while waiting for emnloyment
ought to be a charge against the coal when
it is mined.
One of the biggest deputations Adelaide
has ever seen went to the S.A. Government
lately to reouire it to insist on its rights to
the North-South railway—Oodnadatta to
Darwin. The most striking figure was S;mp-
son Newland, old but active, president of the
N.T. Railway League. He called the long
neglect to build the line “a contemptible eva-
sion of a solemn obligation which ought to
be held sacred by all honorable men.” Josiah
Symon recalled that the agreement between
the Commonwealth and S.A. “was five years
under consideration, and emerged a per-
fectly plain record on the statute-book.”
Mclntosh, for the C untry party, mentioned
that a Federal conference of his party last
year unanimously voted for carrying cut
the agreement—and that on the motion of
a Queensland delegate. Premier Barwell, in
reply, told the d°putationists that “the time
has come when South Aus. will stand up for
her rights.” adding that Irs Government wi’l
refuse consent to any Federal railway-build-
ing inside her borders till the prior agree-
ment has been fulfilled—which knocks the
bottom clean out of the Bruce-Page weak
and evasive railway programme.
Macpherson’s defeat of Minister of Justice
Lee in the recontested Oamaru (M.L.) elec-
tion is a severe blow to Premier Massey. His
Government can still carry on* but only by
sufferance of three Liberals, who have
pledged themselves to vote against Labor on
a no-confidence motion, not that they love
Massey more, but that they love Holland
less. Massey wants to go to the Imperial
Conference, but with Lee outed it will be
a risky trip.
This is the time of year when most life-
assurance offices send out their reports, and
chairmen talk of the soundness of their con-
cerns and the excellence of their bonuses. In
three cases out of four the directors point
out that, in order to make the future safe
for policy-holders, they have assumed that
only 3 p.c. interest will be earned, and they
collect premiums on that basis: u the funds
actually earn more, well, then, the surplus
can be divided in bonuses. Exactly the same
principle should be applied to public works.
It ought to be assumed that they will in
future earn only 3 p.c.; then their capital
value should be written down accordingly,
and the loans which are in excess of that
value should be paid off with all speed. Tne
financial method which the A.M.P. and the
M.L.C. and the National Mutual and the rest
declare to be the only sound one seems a
pretty good one for the States to adopt. Any
way, if the life offices adopted the financial
method of the States, there isn’t a sane actu-
IN THE SADDLING PADDOCK.

THEODORE : “ Thanks. And what about running dead straight this time? The horse can
win all right.”
ary in the world who wouldn’t tell them that
they were calling tenders for a smash.
“Scrutineer”: Yowles never was, and never
will be, taken to the hearts of the Queens-
land cookies. Further, he fussed about too
much in electorates where there were no
real contests. Part of his time was spent in
Fassifern seeking to out E. T. Bell, who had
left him to try to accomplish unity. As for
following Theodore or Jones up and nailing
their arguments, he had about as much in-
clination to do that as Taylor, who, in the
last fortnight, rushed out to the Central-
Western Labor strongholds, where he made
such an impression that the Labor candi-
dates mostly held on by two-to-one majori-
ties. The whole anti-Labor campaign was
inept and futile, while Theodore marshalled
his forces like a general. Theodore, though,
had his surprises. He was cocksure of win-
ning the Lockyer, formerly held by Cuthbert
Butler; Nanango was another d;sap-
pointment. Both Theodore and Alf Jones,
the latter perhaps the most persuasive
Labor talker in the North, toured Nanango
in support of Captain Webster, an A.I.F.
man and a farmer; but he finished well be-
hind, in spite of the .Labor leader's blandish-
ments.
The Hughes Government never lost a
chance to bungle, and in provid.ng for the
election of a Rep. for the Northern Territory
it was at least consistent. The law which it
forgot to alter provides that the appeal
against a Federal election must be lodged
within 40 days after the return of the writ
“in the pr.nc.pal registry of the High Court
(Melbourne), or in any district reg.stry of
that court in the capital city of the 8 cate in
which the election was held.” But the N.T.
isn’t a State, and has no State capital, and
there is no Federal registry there even if
there was a capital to put it in ; and as it
takes many days to collect the evidence to
put in a petition, there is no hope of getting
a letter to Melbourne by the s.s. Seldom
inside the 40 days. So it seems that under
the present law any old th.ng may be done
at an election in the N.T. and the first past
the post remains the winner.
. Tue Commonwealth Government is mak-
ing a sensible attempt to promote uniformity
throughout the States in respect to no-work
days. It is proposed that there should be
10 regulation holidays, including Arzac Dav,
Labor Day (the first Monday in October),
and the King’s Birthday, ail over Australia,
and that each State should be assigned two
spare holidays to place where it likes. This
arrangement, if it commends itself to the
Premiers’ Conference, will give one addi-
tional day to tlie gala tally of South A us.,
which is the most hardwoiking of the States;
and it will lop four from Queensland’s calen-
dar. Apparently it won’t affect the habit
that many unions in N.S.W. have of making
Saturday a full holiday—a habit that gives
the lazy State 26 days per annum more idle-
ness than the others.
“Flicker”: The sooner uniform divorce
law arrives the better. The other day a cor-
respondent asked an Adelaide paper what h.s
rights were and was told: “A divorced per-
son may remarry immediately after the
decree absolute (not nisi ) has been given.”
In almost any other part of the Empire
except South Aus. this would be correct.
But in that State a decree absolute is ap-
pealable against any time within s'x calendar
months after the granting thereof, and “any
marriage solemnised between the parties”
within that six months is invalid. In short,
S.A. possesses the Alice in Wonderland d's-
tinction of having a decree absolute that, on the
face of it, is nothing of the sort; and if some
perfectly well-intentioned people have mar-
ried within the proscribed period and now
find that the’r children are illegitimate, who
can be surprised?
Goveniing bodies which can’t think up a
constructive idea to make a programme with
are reduced to doing arrogant things, for
unless the mailed fist is kept waving their
subjects may lose their proper sense of awe.
That was why the roaring boys in Moscow
declared that their territorial waters ex-
tended 12 miles out, instead of the univer-
sally accepted three miles. They couldn’t
make enough to pay wear and tear of the
legal apparatus out of the seizure of a few
foreign fishing boats, and they made several
dozen enemies, besides risking the loss of
the trading privileges which they had
schemed so hard to get. And when Britain
despatched om* minor vessel to the Murmansk
coast the mailed fist began to look absurd.
There is also an element of the grotesque in
•the attitude of the U.S.A. that foreign ves-
sels approaching their coast, must throw all
liquor overboard outside the three-mile limit.
Still, a nation vv ; th so manv armaments can
take chances of being grotesque. It can
say, like the uncivil Mr. Hoggenheimer in
opera: “I’m not rude: I’m rich.”
Feeling a trifle more “militant” than usual
the other day, the Sydney Labor Council
passed a resolution wdrich “demanded” many
things. The “demands” were directed at the
U.S.A., and one of them insisted that Con-
gress should repeal the “criminal Syndi-
calist law.” To show that the Council
(which nowadays is attended by the dele-
gates of only about a score of unions) was
serious, the interesting outburst was ordered
to be forwarded to the American Consul.
When the Associated Millionaires of Monaco
send to Prime Minister Bruce demanding the
instant dispersal of the Sydney Labor Coun-
cil, that body may begin to suspect that it
butted in where it d'dn’t belong.
P. G. Stewart, Minister for Works and
Railways, is an ardent booster of the New
States movement because he has a good
argument in its favor almost at his back
door. Across the Murray, near his home, is
the Darling pastoral country of N. S. Wales,
whose average population is about one sheep
to 15 acres. On the Victorian side there is
about one family to the same area. He
wants to see a new T State carved out of Vic.,
N.S.W. and South Aus. with Mildura as the
capital—which explains the close relations
of Page and Stewart.
“Werrimee”: N.S.W. Minister Wearne
proposes to assist settlers to clear prickly-
pear country and to give them the land when
they have finished the job. His first step
should be to settle the fringe of the pear-
country, and thus enclose the tangled, hope-
less area with small holdings. This would
stop the present rapid spread of the pest,
and the yarded nightmare could then be
dealt with. In fact, the Government might
be able to give it away then.
The absurdity of collecting Federal land-
tax on city properties has become a subject
of discussion. The tax is meant to strike
big properties, but as it takes no account of
area it only strikes expens,ve ones. It is
now possible (or soon will be), owing to
the One Big City curse, for an allotment to
be smaller than it should be for health pur-
poses, yet for the tax oflic'als to say that it
ought to be cut in two and blow health pur-
poses. The possession of a thunderously-
expensive site by a city bus ness man doesn’t
prove that he is the obnoxious kind of indi-
vidual who has money to burn. It only
proves that he had to raise the price by
hook or crook, or not be a city business man.
The Irish P.M.G. has protested against
“Br.tish tobacco manufacturers coming to
the Free State to erect factories in older
to .evade, the..customs barrier,” and says that
“if foreigners come here to grao the fru.ts
we will have only changed one slavery for
another.” But this isn't a “wrong” speci-
ally composed for the downtreading of Ire-
land ; it is something that every nation must
provide aga.nst or lose its grip. There are
men with a tooth or two still remaining who
remember when almost every industry worth
having in Germany belonged, in whole or
part, to Englishmen; when English- ships
did the German carrying; and when the ap-
pearance of what purported to be the Ger-
man ensign on the seas moved the enraged
Palmerston to demand “What is this pirate
flag?” Shortly before the Franco-rrussian
war a company was formed in Britain to
even supply Berlin with a cattle market.
Germany scrambled out of that “slavery”
when the right man arrived, and if Ireland
can find the rieht man it mav even begin
“enslaving” England.
“Palam”: The pre-election secrecy which
enveloped the claims of Driver and the Greens
against the War Service Homes Commis-
sion (incidentally, the Greens have been
awarded £87,000) has been copied by the
Public Accounts Committee in investigating
the doings of the Disposals Boards whose
job was to realise on the Commission’s sur-
plus stocks. The Labor trio on the com-
mittee —West (N.S.W.), Makin (S.A.) and
Fenton (Vic.) —wanted the inquiry open,
but the new chairman, Bayley (Q.), thought
otherwise. The law under which the com-
mittee works leaves the question of publicity
or privacy to its own discretion. When the
sugar accounts were probed last year the
work was done in public, as also was the
first inquest into the war homes hash. Fowler
(W.A.), who lost his seat in December, be-
lieved in above-ground raking of waste and
wreckage, and got himself disliked more than
ever on this account. The new chairman is
inexperienced in the job, and takes a puncti-
lious view of his responsibilities to Parlia-
ment. Sales of timber, etc., valued at nearly
f1.000.C00 and the sawmill purchases at
Canungra (Q.) and elsewhere are being re-
viewed. The taxpayer who will have to foot
the bill for the abominable muddle has a
right to hear the evidence.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Shortly after Minister Pearce arrived at Port
Darwin the naval sloop Geranium berthed at the
jetty, its appearance giving rise to a rumor that
the visitor was to be provided with an armed guard
for protection against the local Bolsheviks.”
Into the lion’s jaws
Amid subdued applause
He pokes his cranium ;
But, for emergency.
An it should needed be,
Swift glideth in from sea
The sloop Geranium.
He goes where colleagues bid.
Just as he always did;
No duty vexes.
London or U.S.A.
He’ll visit any day
Merely to earn his pay
And draw his exes.
Serene ibis course he’d held
Where Gardens raved; where yelled
Unruly Walshes
7" He never turned a hair;
But ’tik anoth’r affair
To beard them in their lair,
These Darwin Bolshies.
Here fumes the turbulent
Mob that kept Gilruth pent
By force excessive
Within his house and ground,
And posted pickets round
Just as a hint they found
Hfs rule oppressive.
And here they still abide,
The blokes who Law defied
And Order thwarted,
When Carey and the rest •
Were summarily pressed
Aboard a boat bound west—
In brief, deported.
From human wolves so fierce,

Guard his extraneuin
Corpus from blow or thrust
Where Bolshies raise, the dust I
In Thee we place our trust —
And the Geranium!

The IVLL.C. is the Commonwealth’s biggest
and most successful co-operative life office.
Its .prosperity has been quoted a good deal in
the flotation boom which has been proceed-
ing for several years as evidence of poss.h li-
ties of new proprietary ventures. But
not in any prospectus has a promoter told
the real reasons of the M.L.C.’s remarkable
success. There has been no mention, either,
of the M.L.C.’s definite undertaking to handle
policies within a specified cost-rate. Further,
only a few of the new floats have provided for
co-operation on the same basis as the M.L.C.,
which guarantees that £BO per £lOO of all
Ordinary profits shall be distributable among
holders of with-profit contracts. Some of
the recent floats would have been impossible
had the Commonwealth Parliament been
given the opportunity of adopting the recom-
mendations of Royal Commissioners J. H.
Hood and G._ IL Ivnibbs in 1910. One of
the results of that neglect has, been that life-
assurance law varies in each State, and in
most there is no regulation whatever of cos.
seeking to act as trustees of the public’s cash
by way of life policies. The other day a
deputation of actuaries was moved to appeal
to Vic. Attorney-General Arthur Robinson to
tighten up that State’s company legislation to
curb the wild-cat life promoter. It is a
rnatter the Commonwealth Government should
hasten to look into; too much harm has.
already been done by neglect.
Here are some explanations of the M.L.C.’s
success in a nutshell:—
(1) The management is efficient. Its executive
officers are shareholders, and for every £1 extra,
profit in which they may share they are obliged to
find £4 for policy-holders. That is an inducement
to select risks carefully, keep down costs, and get
the maximum results from investments.
• (2) The Ordinary expense rate last year was 8.45
p.c. of total income, notwithstanding that the volume
Of new business was the largest written for any year.
On the basis of premiums alone the expense rate
worked out at 13.4 p.e. There is, therefore, a
wide margin between actual performances and the
15 p.c. of income which the co. guarantees that costs
shall not exceed.
(3) The average interest rate earned by Ordinary
funds was slightly over 5 p.c.
One way and another, when actuary Miller
reviewed the year’s operations, he found a
surplus of £484,288 above the amount he
estimated was required to cover Ordinary
policy obligations as at December 31 last.
Incidentally, this proprietary calculates its
liabilities on the conservative basis customary
in the big mutual offices: though interest
earnings gave 5 p.c. last year, the actuary
assumes that only 3 p.c. will be averaged
during the currency of policies. This assump-
tion of low interest earnings requires a larger
reserve than would be necessary if a high
rate were assumed; so that the office is
really stronger than even the balance-
sheet figures indicate. The M.L.C.’s biggest
achievement has been in the matter of costs,
which are now slightly less than in 1914. In
old-established offices The Bulletin allows
7 p.c. of renewal premiums (annuities 3 p.c.)
as a fair charge for handling old business,
and debits the balance of,exes, against pre-
miums from new policies. On that basis, the
M.L.C.’s new-business cost-rate last year was
68 p.c., or approximately only two-thirds the
cost, estimated in the same way, incurred by
several big competitors.
However it may be in theory, it does not
necessarily follow in practice that a mutual
office is a better proposition for the policy-
holder than one in which proprietors take a
bite. The M.L.C. can give a “stable tip” on
the matter. When the old Citizens’ Co. had
proved its efficiency, the Mutual Life Associ-
ation and the Australian Widows’ Fund, two
purely mutual offices, were amalgamated
with it. Both were sound and highly. re-
spectable, but their affairs had run into
still waters. The Citizens’ gave definite
undertakings as to costs when the businesses
were transferred, but actual results haye
been far in excess of anticipations. Each
year gives larger bonuses in both sections.
For 1922 the M.L.A. and A.VV.F. policy-
holders get compound reversionary bonuses
of (ids. 3d. p.c. on sums assured and on exist-
ing bonuses, and that is equal to 83s. p.c.
on the sum assured, and represents, in the
A.W.F. section, a cash bonus equal to no
less than 95 p.c. of premiums paid during
the year. That, the management says, “con-
stitutes a world s record.” Reversionary
bonuses on “M.L.C.” policies run from 745.
per £lOO of assurance 25 years in force to
495. for those five years in force.

This branch pay? no bonuses. It guarantees
(the co.’s capital is the bond) the amount of
assurance contracted for, and any profit re-
verts to shareholders. In this department
the M.L.C. is also cutting costs: 20.68 p.c.
of total income last year, compared with
29.41 p.c. in 1921, and 29.79 in 1920.
The co. publishes a separate balance-sheet
for each department, and also an aggregate
balance-sneet. The latter now tots up almost
16 i millions, but among liabilities is
£2,650,464 due to sundry creditors, which is
mostly the balance of the huge overdraft
raised from the Commonwealth Bank when
the management decided to pledge surpluses
for a number of years to enable it to invest
heavily in War loans. The effect of that
policy is shown in this comparison of assets:
1914. p.c. 1922. p.c.
Public securities £3,996.386 42.6 £13,879,548 85.4

Liabilities .. 105,952 2,808,986
Net assets ... £9,270,418 £13,435,557
The list is of excellent, quality. The mort-
gages are all old investments, and at the
i alancing-date only £BB2 of interest was out-
standing.
Paid capital is £200,000, and during the
12 months ended December 31 shareholders
received £53,280 from the Ord nary branch
and £71,486 from Industrial operations, the
two making a total div. of 62.3 p.c. Tne
M.i,.C. has 465 000 policy-holders assured for
40 millions. The average per policy written
by the Ordinary department is now £275
compared with £lBl only seven years ago.

Younghusband’s has been handling wool,
grain and produce in Victoria and in south-
ern N. S. Wales—there are branches at
Albury and Loekhart—for 34 years. Until
1.920 it was a proprietary, though balance-
sheets were published, and shares were listed
on ’Change only last year. The re-constitu-
tion of the co. was not accompanied by any
financial recon struct.'on: paid capital was in-
creased from £69,825 to £lOO,OOO about the
same time, but the additions were appar°nf’y
contributed in cash. And since verv little
of its war-time earnings were passed on to
shareholders, the co, is now in a very snug
condition and splendidly equipped to earn
good divs. Ten years ago there were re-
serves of fGHS 1 in excess of those required
to displace an intangible asset of £42,047.
The latter was written out of the books s ; x
years ago, and there are now visible reserves
a few pounds more than the paid capital of
£lOO.OOO, which means that the cu’s ,own
funds have to earn only 7i p.c. to give the
15 p.c. div. the co. has paid for the past
12 months. Actually, funds returned almost
12 p.c. last year, and £8(340 went into re-
serve. Profits in the table have been t rratic
in recent years, but they merely reflect the
switchback course of world’s markets. Wool
handlings for a number of years have been
as follows: —
Bales. Bales.

1916 .. 38,444 . 1922 .. 49,513
1918 . . 50,288 1923 . . 68,106
The record figures for the past year no doubt
include 16,959 bales in store unsold at the
previous balancing-date. The turnover of
other produce continues to expand, so further
additions are now being made to the co.’s
stores.
The following comparisons of balance-sheet
figures record the results of the past nine
years’ operations in another way :

The installation of grain-elevators at the
Kensington (Melb.) stores, additions to
build.ngs and plant, and the recent purchase
of the office premises the co. had tenanted
for many years, have added almost £30,060
to fixed assets since 3914. Advances on pro-
duce and other amounts owing have expand d
£120,000-odd, and investments and other
assets have grown £31,245. Altogether the
increase of tangible assets in the nine years
was £181,429. Meanwhile, liabilities have
become £61,451 larger. Only £30,175 of new
capital was required to effect an improve-
ment of nearly £120,000 in net assets, which
means that surplus profits helped the expan-
sion with £89.803. During the period divs.
averaged lOf p.c. p.a. on paid capital
which had not been inflated by bonus issues.
The directors might have been f rgiven for
ladling out a little more profit in the fat
years; instead, they preferred to proceed cau-
tiously and take advantage of abnormal con-
dit'ons to develop their co. on a sound basis.
And shareholders are now the better off be-
cause of that.

-The Bank of Adelaide has nearly MX)
branches and agencies in S. Aus., and runs
its own offices in Sydney, Melbourne and
Perth. The expansion of business outside its
home State dec'ded the directors to issue a
quarter-million of new capital last year, and
the total is now £875,000. The new £5-
paid shares were issued at a premium of'£l,
anfi that contributed £50,000 to reserves,
which amount to £749.701 and help consider-
ably in providing regular 10 p.c. d'.vs. Ten
years ago the bank’s capital and reserves
totalled slightly more, than • a million ; now
it has £1,624,700 of its- own funds at work.
Though new capital, sharp-premiums and
surplus profit contributed £327,400 during
the past 12 months, there was a faliing-off
of £263,460 in the balance-sheet total. De-
posits at March 31 were smaller than at any
balance s'nce 1919, owing chiefly to the with-
drawal of Government money, but partly to
settlements in respect of last season’s wheat-
crop not having been completed when the
bank’s books closed. Harvest financing was
also responsible for larger advances. Here
are the grouped balance-sheet figures for the
past four years

Notwithstanding the calls on the bank by
the Government and the larger advances, at
March 31 51 p.c. of all liabilities to the
public was within easy reach. But in addi-
tion to that strength—the management was
holding in liquid form about one-fourth more
than is generally considered a fair propor-
tion —the Bank of Adela'de held only £3 17s.

safety zone with liabilities double the size.
Here is another way of looking at the secu-
rity offered the depositor aufi other creditors.
At March 31 the £3,087,265 of liabilities not
covered by liquid assets had the backing of
£4,478,926 of advances and premises with a
book value of £269,289, altogether 375. for

Everything considered, Finney’s has come
through it difficult period very well. Similar
cos. in other capital cities have d me better,
but Brisbane has Hot offered equal oppor-
tunities. According to the directors, “the
outstanding features which have interfered
have been, firstly, the intense competition
to maintain a volume of business, _ which re-
sulted in the general cutting of sel ing prices;
and, secondly, the insistent pressure of ex
penses, from which there has been no
escape.” Brisbane, they claim, is “the keen-
est market for softgqods in the Comm n-
wealth.” Last year’s gross profits (£177,136)
slightly bettered the average for 1920-21;
but expenses were £22,000-odd higher than
three years ago. That bears out the direc-
tors’ declaration that, failing a reduction of
exes., the volume of business must be in-
creased to give shareholders divs. on the war-
time scale. However, £43,799 of the paid
capital of £275,993 has been bonus scrip, so
the effective div. rate is a little more than
that declared. On the other band, the re-
serves transferred were piled up in years
when distributions to shareholders were kept
down so that the business could be' soundly
developed.
The policy of seeking a larger turnover
has resulted in heavier buying, ahd st cks
at the latest balance about £50,000
bigger than 12 months before, and only
£17,500 less than the abnormally large stocks
held in 1921. So, though portion of the
building site was sold during the year, liabili-
ties have expanded:—

Sydney Colliebies, Ltd. —In January an
effort was made to revive the old Balmain
Colliery by means of a new* co. hay-
ing a nominal capital of a half-mill on, in
which the vendors were to take 192,000 fully-
paid £1 shares and £BO,OOO cash, payable in
four equal annual instalments. The ven-
dors undertook to distribute 46,000 of their
fully-paids among subscribers to the 230,000
£1 contribs. offered. Though “considerably
over £300,000” was said to have been spent
by the old co. on plant and machinery, which
are still in good condition, -and though it .s
estimated that to equip, open out and develop
to the existing stage would now take close
on a m li on, the inducement was apparently
not sufficient. So a new prospectus has
been issued in which the vendors want only
135,000 fully-paids—-26,000 of which are to
be employed as bonuses lone "n five) to eon-
tribs (£130,000) —and £75.000 cash, payab’e
£lO,OOO on signing of contract, five annual
instalments of £5OOO each and £40,000 at the
close of the sixth year. One result of the
re-arrangement is that £5OOO cash and
£37,000 in fully-paids (making allowance for
the bonus allotments) have been cl'pped from
the purchase consideration. Another is that
the eo.' has not to raise so much capital at
the beginning: during the first three years it
has to find for vendors only £25.000 cash in-
stead of £BO,OOO under the prev.ous scheme.
The proposed cap'tal outlay is the same
(£lOO.OOOl. but the new arrangement pro-
vides £2O 000 working cap’tal instead of
the £50,000 originally planned. A point the
latest prospectus does not stress is that
£50,000 cash has to be found for vendor®
between the third and sixth years, and no

“PETROL-ELECTRICS FOR THE L.G.O.C.
“We understand on excellent authority that the London General Omnibus Co., Ltd., has placed an order with Tilling-Stevens Motors, Ltd., for
.150 Petrol-electric ’buses. Seventy-five are to be delivered this year, and 75 in 1924.
“This announcement will create much interest throughout the road passenger-carrying industry. Tilling-Stevens petrol-electric vehicles, as our
readers are aware, are already giving splendid service in London and also in the provinces, and the order appears to indicate that the particular claims
and performance of petrol-electric transmission for this kind of work have not passed unnoticed by those in charge of the largest ’bus company in the
w T orld. M

provision for that settling is discussed. The
promoters have not altered their estimate of
piofits, and reckon on the smaller capital
earning 28 p.c. p.a. instead of the 16 p.c. anti-
cipated on the larger capital. But the latest
calculation does not take into account the
£65,000 cash owing to the vendors after the
ihitial payment. Presumably profits are ex-
pected to meet the whole of the cash-purchase
balance. The co, will be extremely fortu-
nate if they do. The mining aspects of the
proposition were discussed by The Bulletin
on January 18 last.

The vagaries of the tin market of late have
been disconcerting to mine-owners. The
steady rise from about £l6O to £220 led to
the supposition that higher prices had “come
to Stay.” Afly proffered explanation of the
fecent. fall is mere conjecture, but the general
idea is that Malayan holders have been
Unloading stocks in excess of the quantities
tvhich a feW weeks since it was “officially”
ifftimated they intended to dispose of. The
Bulletin has authority for stating that a
prominent Australian buyer is accumulating
Stocks iff anticipation of values improving

Manager James Negus, of Mount Boppy
(N.S.W.), is still on the hunt for another
gold-mine for his co. For some years he has
been investigating shows all over the State.
His latest option is over Sheehan’s, at Junc-
tion Reef, Lyndhurst. This is an old field
remarkable for its geology, the gold-bearing
ore-bodies occurring dn almost horizontal
layers like coal seams. Three of these ore-
beds where exposed in the hillside are from
6ft. to 20ft. thick. They have been mined
extensively, and in early stages are said to
have given satisfactory results to working
parties; but handled on a big scale by suc-
cessive syndicates and cos. there was no
profit.
In few places elsewhere in the Common-
wealth is gold seen in a finer state than at
Lyndhurst. Recovery has proved extremely
difficult. From “blanketings” assaying as
high as 30oz. gold no appreciable return
could be won from grinding in mercury in
Berdan pans and Chilian mills. Microscopic
examination showed that the particles of
gold, even the finest, were coated with an
intensely hard film of silica, and it was not
until vigorous work with the Wedgewoods
had reduced samples to absolutely impalpable
slime that mercury or solvents would act. It
is almost a certainty that for every ounce of
fold won in early times another ounce must
ave been washed away in the Belubula
River. Sheehan’s mine is the only point at
which any work has been done for years.
Operated in a small way it has been a con-
sistent, but not sensational, producer: 1920,
1200 tons, £1200; 1921, 700 tons, £B2O. In
the latter year it was reported that sulphide
ore going 2oz. per ton had been struck.
Cedar Creek, near Lionsville (N.S.W.), is
getting its battery into trim for a trial run
on 50 tons ore collected from several reefs.
So far values have been estimated on dish
samples only, so the plant will now have a
say as to values. It will also “determine
the proportion in which it will be necessary
to mine the ore from the different reefs.”
■* * * *
For many years great heaps of slag have
been lying around the old Glen Smelting Co.’s
works at Tent Hill, Emmaville (N.S.W.).
In the “good old days” the co. at times had
up to 200 tons tin stacked. O. T. Lempriere
and Co. have lately been investigating the
slag, of which there is 3000 to 5000 tons,
and a trial shipment having given fairly
satisfactory results, a further shipment is
being bagged. If tests continue satisfactory
the lot will be treated. One estimate places
the value of the heaps at 6 p.c. smelted tin
and about 1 p.c. unsmelted oxide.
* * * *
The farce of granting exemptions on appa-
rently worthless oil areas continues in West-
ralia. The other day six months’ exemption
was secured by the holders of sand and
scrub around Bremer Bay and Cape Leeu-
win, and three months’ by several holders of
spinifex country in the northern part of the
State. In each case the plea put forward
was that time was required to induce the
public to come in.
* * * *
Jack McDermott, of the Ivanhoe (W.A.),
has gone to London to confer with the direc-
tors about many things, and also, it is said,
to induce them to find money to re-open the
Sand Queen and Gladsome mines at Comet
Yale. These two shows adjoin, and were
once profitable ventures. Water at depth
settled the Sand Queen and then drowned
the Gladsome.
* * * *
North Kalgurli and the adjoining Union Jack
lease, Kalgoorlie, have been sorted out of a
heap of derelicts with a view to early flota-
tion. Nearly £lOO,OOO of gold has been taken
out of the former mine in the last 20 years,
mostly by tribute parties, and the latter pro-
perty has furnished occasional returns. Both
are reckoned to be possible deep-ground suc-
cesses, but the prospects in that part of the
field at depth are very doubtful.
The activity of Adelaide cos. on Jones’s
Mining Concessions, beyond Laverton
(YV.A.), has been followed by “encouraging
reports” from neighboring fields. Many
mines were floated thereabouts during the
boom days of the early ’nineties, but few
reached the producing stage, and fewer stiff
earned anything for shareholders. Most
proved worthless, and when funds gave out
they shut down. At least one show which
was abandoned years ago, after having been
proved valueless by development, is now being
boosted in Adelaide and Melbourne as a real
good thing,, and its eai-ly flotation is said to
be assured.
* * *
As the owners of Ives Reward Junction
(W.A.) could not agree, the auctioneer was
called in. The whole outfit was knocked
down in Kalgoorlie the other day for £1825.
When the Ives field was first discovered, the
Junction was reported to have a 12ft. quartz
reef showing free gold. This reef was the
show-place of the field for a time. Howevei’,
instead of the gold being distributed across
and through the reef, it lay in a thin veneer
along one of the walls, which was the only
part of the reef visible in the costeen.
r * * *
The Lloyd George, Coolgardie, in which
Sydney is interested, has got its own bat-
tery at last, and shareholders will soon leajn
the value of the show. A good deal of miff-
ing has been done in the Lloyd George area,
but all the tested have failed at depth
or in average values. The Lloyd George
crowd, howevei’, claim that their show is
different.
* » * *
Menzies (W.A.) was best known in the
early days through the Lady Shenton, which
paid big divs. and then went wrong at depth.
The mine was eventually abandoned. Now
a local syndicate is being formed to give the
Lady another chance to reclaim her reputa
tion.

One of the most hopeful documents issued
for years in connection with Vic. gold-
mining is a report by Geologist-surveyor
Cundy, of Bendigo, on the Walhalla field, one
of whose old mines, the Long Tunnel, still
holds the State’s record as a producer and
div.-payer. Referring to the prospecting
work done by the New Long Tunnel, Over-
seas and North Overseas cos., he is niost
optimistic as to their future and the effect
of their developments on the field. These
operations, he states, have revealed dykes
and reefs hitherto unknown, and added im-
portant facts which will materially assist in
tracing the reef channels. “It may seem
incredfile to many interested in the field
that north of the old Walhalla co.’s ground
practically the whole of the country above
the old tunnel levels remains unprospected
to-day.”
* * * *
Bendigo Amalgamated shareholders are to
be asked to sanction a reduction of capital
from £350,000, in 700,000 shares of 10s., to
£175,000 in 700,000 shares of os. The reduc-
tion is to be effected by returning Is. per
share in cash, and by cancelling paid-up capi-
tal which has been lost or is unrepresented
by available assets to the extent of 4s. per
share.
“Optic”: “Old Alluvialist” (B. 17/5/’23)
flutes many false notes about New Langi
Logan, Ararat (Vic.). The capital and
gold shoved into New Langi Logan has
totalled nearly £200,000. All the workings
down to the Cathcart tributary from the old
mainshaft were thought by Ilebbard to con-
tain pay dirt. They might have when wages
were 10s. a day and there were plenty of
skilled men to work a full 48 hours, but con-
ditions have changed, and the ground down to
the Cathcart has to be ruled out. That tri-
butary is about done, leaving the lower sec-
tion of the Langi gutter to the South Langi
boundary available. This gives about half-
a-mile of gutter with heavy wash and a
strong flow of water. The big bump in
the bottom of the lead below the Cathcart
junction cut out several hundred feet of
wash, and now a block 400 ft. long by 300 ft.
wide is being developed from the rises put
up from the main under-level. Accepting
the whole block to be payable, and that, on
experience up the gutter north and down in
the South Langi, isn’t justified, there is not
more than 4000 fathoms available. For a
big alluvial show that is a mere patch. As
to what the wash will average, no man can
say. Even should the Cathcart give enrich-
ments below the junction, no one has dared
to estimate above 30dwt. for the lead in either
New or South Langi, and with present costs
that grade will leave very little for the share-
holder, though it will keep the miner em-
ployed. If South Langi threw in the towel,
and that would astonish no one, the field
would be open to New Langi; but all the
time work is going into deeper and wetter
ground with higher costs and no tributaries
to enrich the wash. So once again it may
be repeated that New’ Langi is a pure pros-
pecting show with costly ground to operate
and a bad record behind it.
* * * *
Tin production in North Queensland should
mildly boom during the next few months.
The Great Northern at Ilerberton ought to
be worth watching: everything is ready to
start milling a big block of ore which is
expected to crush well. The new workings
recently broke through to the old stopes,
where some good ore is showing. The old
Bradlaugh is looking good, and a big face
in the winze below the 330 ft. crosscut is esti-
mated to run 30 p.c. At Irvinebank pros-
pects are not quite so healthy, as the Gor-
don, which last year looked one of the best,
has been idle, and the Vulcan has cut out
of good ore, the last 94 tbns taken by the
tributors giving only five tons concentrates.
At Kangaroo Hills prospects have bright-
ened for the Shrimp, which is sinking on a
good shoot, and put through a small crush-
ing of 4 p.c. dirt the other day. The North
Sardine manager, apparently convinced that
he was on the wrong line, is crosscutting for
another formation in the search for the Sar-
dine shoots. The Canary still looks well,
and a new show, the Jugular, is opening up
with promise.
* * * *
Dr. W. G. Woolnough has gone to Clon-
curry to look at some of the shows, and par-
ticularly at the Mt. Cobalt deposit, towards
which English eyes are turning with inter-
est. Woolnough, who was formerly Prof.
David’s right-hand man, took the Perth
Chair of Geology, but gave that up to repre-
sent a British co. interested in industrial
minerals.

The two chief mines at Mt. Coolon (Q.),
the Native Bear and Mt. Coolon, both cleaned
up during April, and the combined figures
make the output for the month one of the
best for the little field. The Bear crushed
420 tons for 3590 z. worth £1257, and the
Coolon 260 tons for 2zsoz. worth £lOO7.
There’s little doubt that both could double
their present output if desired, but the
policy seems to be to make the ore last as
long as possible, although the Coolon lode is
big and is not being worked deeper than
100 ft. at present. V
* * * *
Scottish Gympie’s contribution to the
April output of the field was 13420 z. from
4500 tons, barely £1 per ton. The Mines
Department bore at the Great Northern
Extended is down over 400 ft., and the coun-
try is becoming interesting: it is out of the
line and into slate showing partings of plum-
bago. The Lucknow, operating with the a d
of a £2OO subsidy, is sinking a straight shaft,
down over 210 it., to seek the plumbago slates.
Gympie banks on plumbago.
* * * *
Mt. Mudlo’s (Q.) last concentrates turned
out very poorly; 222 tons ore reduced to
11.16 tons returned 2.14 tons copper, 570 z.
silver and 1.480 z. gold, total value £l5O.
This seems to bear out a rather unpalatable
opinion expressed by the “Wild Cat” last
year that the best ore had gone. Better ore
has been got at several points on the lode
recently, but the approximate values have
not been indicated. The falling back of the
market is not making Mudlo supporters feel
cheerful.
* * * *
Mt. Nolan, Silver Valley (Q.), is leading
Ilerberton field in output. One good crush-
ing has just been followed by another: 12
tons tin wortn £1285 from 140 tons. The
old Bradlaugh, however, appears to be on the
richest ore. The ore body in the winze be-
low the 330 ft. level has been averaging over
30 p.c.
Values in the Frederick mine having dis-
appointed, the Billy Hughes co. is consider-
ing giving several other of its Normanby
(N.Q.) shows a run. About £250 has been
spent on the Perseverance, and for another
£lOO it is reckoned to get down to the 160 ft.
workings, where a body of 2oz. ore is said
to exist. During the past month two lots
were crushed from this show: 5 tons aver-
aged 2oz. and 9 tons loz. 6dwt. Five tons
from the Glengarry went 1-Joz., and 18 tons
from the Frederick averaged 13dwt. The
co. is now awaiting the Government geolo-
gist’s advice before deciding which of its
string of shows should be given preference.
Recently a promising new find of l-|oz. stuff
near the battery has been receiving atten-
tion. Meanwhile, 50 tons from the Grant,
expected to go 20z., is to be carted to bat-
tery.
Local opinion is that Tyreonnell, Kings-
borough (N.Q.), will have a long drive to
reach the ore-body from the bottom of its
shaft, but that, if funds hold out until the
work is completed, there should be good pros-
pects ahead for the battery.

The Speck’s mineral return for the March
quarter puts electrolytic zinc on top with
8103 tons spelter worth £244,800. Mt. Lyell
was credited with £125,000, but it had stop-
pages. Limestone broken at the B. H. Prop.’s
quarries was worth £31,000, and Gillies’s
carbide furnished £25,000.

Briseis Central (Tas.) directors propose
to raise £7OOO by the issue of 28,000 of the
unsold 10s. shares at ss. to provide for the
“completion of •construction works, so that
tin-raising may commence.” Much larger
expenditure than this must be .anticipated, as
it is stated that “the proceeds will suffice
to advance the work to such a stage that
there will be no trouble in financing the
balance by debentures or the issue of more
of the unsold shares, which the directors teej.
confident will be disposed of at a premium.
Some shareholders have offered to surrender
sufficient shares (paid to 10s.) to guarantee
a bonus of 15 p.c. on the issue of new snares
at 55.; thus, an applicant for 1000 at os. each
will get 1150 shares paid to 10s. *
“Seepages” are the S. Aus. Oilwells Co. s
long suit at present. Drilling at Anglesea
(Vic.) is held up for want of water, so the
crew has been on the hunt for seepages on
the seashore near Nelson. One sample is
claimed to have shown “crude oil of heavy
gravity and asphaltum basis.”

A dour lot foregathered around John Bran-
don and Peter Sutherland in Melbourne the
other dav to hear the latest of the Waria
ltiver flutter. Sutherland wouldn’t have it
that Barton and Black, the examining engi-
neers, had got on to the wrong area. Now
they are to east about further afield for an-
other show. One innocent inquired if Kempt,,
the original reporter on the area, had been
asked tor an explanation, but as he has gone
to Europe the chance of reaching him is
slim. Anyway, Barton and Black are
reliable, and no talk from Ivempf will per-
suade the average man that the show has not
been thoroughly examined.
Larut (F.M.S.) directors have been con-
sidering the life of their property, and have
decided that advantage should be taken of
the present cash position to return one-third
of the £lOO,OOO paid capital. Meetings of
shareholders at Taiping, where the co. is
registered, have confirmed the proposal, and
the cash (6s. Bd. per £1 fully-paid) will be
distributed when legal formalities are con-
cluded.
A new project, as an offshoot of old-time
mining work, is the formation of a co. to
acquire the millions of tons of boulders and
gravel at surface on the abandoned alluvial
mines of Ballarat, Creswick, Maryborough
and Chiltern (Vic.), with a view to the
utilisation of the material for concrete work.
The promoters believe that the enterprise
will lead to the establishment of important
local works.

“Henry Horsecollar”: “Clifford Snook”
mentions the Melbourne honorary and un-
honored JiP. who fines the wife-beater a
pound or two and gives him time to pay,
whereupon the beater takes the wife home
and makes her get to work to earn the fine.
But in a recent case he was on the job
faster than that. The policeman had in-
vaded the cottage, and finding Katharine on
the floor grievously damaged had taken
Petruehio into custody. W hereupon the lat-
ter assured him affably that there would be
no trouble about the fine, as the lady had £BO
of her own in the bank. In other words, she

was a solvent person, and quite able to pay
for being soundly thrashed. I often wonder
if the prevalence of this kind of offence in
Melbourne is wholly due to the administra-
tion of cheap and beastly justice by “jus-
tices” whose marked and consistent sym-
pathy for the brutal husband almost amounts
to taking him out for a drink? Or if an un-
duly large section of the people hail (or if
their parents did) from certain parts of the
Cold Country where the habit of domestic
assault amounts to an institution? In the
cheap tenement houses of Glasgow, Liver-
pool and Manchester, when I knew these
towns, wife-beating might be said to com-
mence at 11.15 p.m. on Saturday (pay-day)
and end, except for a few belated arrears, at
8 a.m on Sunday. Certainly some wives
were beaten as early as 4 in the after-
noon, and there was straggling chastisement
from that hour onward, but in general the
11.15 p.m. to 3 a.m. rule held good.

“Lexite” : In no other of the higher juris-
dictions are there as many cases listed and
abandoned as in divorce. The other day
N.S.W. Justice Owen struck out 66 cases
in which no action had been taken for 1-1
months. The cessation of action does not
necessarily mean a restoration of harmony
or a re-union of temporarily severed soul-
mates, but reconciliation in some form is
probably the main factor. The prize for
making it up at the latest possible moment
must be awarded to a pair of domestic liti-
gants who had cross-petitions on the mat
in the Supreme Court at Sydney. Their
cases were called, and their solicitors were
ready, but the parties themselves were miss-
ing, although they had been seen in rue
precincts of the court the same morning.
It subsequently transpired that they had got
into conversation, and had finally drifted
away into the Gardens, where they stayed
all day, oblivious of waiting courts and em-
barrassed lawyers. The cases were struck
out next day.

“Yarrum”: The inspector was making his
periodical visit to a N.S.W. South Coast
school, and began by asking the class what
season of the year it was. “Yes,” said he
after getting an accurate reply, “it’s Spring-
time, and now I want you ail to write some
thing about Spring.” This was the effort
of one freckled hopeful:—
It is Spring, and the flowers are blooming in the
gardens, and the birds are singing in the. trees. The
vermin are all out, and the inspector is here.

“Tarago”; The bomb joke in France
wasn’t always against the Chow. In April,
T 7, we were busy repelling the attack of
14 Fritz battalions that had broken through
our front, line at Lagnicourt. Everyone was
working overtime pumping lead into the
advancing masses at point-blank range, when
a clip of cartridges jambed in Mick’s rifle.
Throwing the useless weapon down with a
curse, he leaped on the bank and called for
bombs. He had worked into a frenzy while
hurling his missiles at the Germans, when
an officer happened along. “You idiot!
pull the pins out!” he yelled. Mick favored
him with a glare. “Ter Hell with them,”
he yelled back. “Let th’ blankards pull ’em
out themselves if they want to —I haven’t
time.”

“Pedagogue”: I was appointed headmaster
at a Gippsland school, 20 miles from a rail-
way station. All previous occupants of the
position had been ladies. Following the
usual custom, I wrote to the school com-
mittee re board and lodging, and received a
reply that a local family would be glad to
accommodate Miss Pedagogue. The letter
further mentioned the names of the ladies
who would meet me at the station. There
was no time to remove the misunderstanding
regarding my sex, and on arrival I found
the commission of two diligently inquiring
for Miss Pedagogue amongst the lady passen-
gers (incidentally, I beard one of them sigh
with relief, “Thank God, that wasn’t she,
anyway!”). Satisfied at last that the object
of their quest was not there, they halted to
discuss the situation : “Well, she’s missed the
’bus.” “Must have slept in. She’ll come
this evening.” “We can’t wait; she’ll have
to stay here to-night.” ,At this point I
advanced and introduced myself as the new
teacher. The first to recover gasped out:
“Good gracious, why didn’t you say you were
a man!” Then, turning to her friend:
“Minnie, you won’t have a room-mate, after
all!”

“Wilfrido” on some disrespectful persons:
The cabled report that one Arthur Ravenhill hurled
a shower of stones at Justice Romer in the Chancery
Division, and was committed to prison, provides us
with an instance of a form of contempt of court that
is comparatively rare in our legal history. Despite
Lord Selbourne’s endeavor in 1883 to have the period
of imprisonment for contempt limited to three months
and a fine of £5OO, the practice of the Chancery
Court is still to imprison without fixing the period,
the offender being left to apply for his release when
he can satisfy the Court that he has purged his con-
tempt. This places a powerful weapon in the hands
of a Judge, and is liable to make even a very angry
litigant a bit careful.
In England an instance of the kind has not occurred
for many years. It was common in the good old
days for the Court to' confiscate the land and goods
; of the offender, besides inflicting severe bodily puhish-
! ment upon him. In the reign of Edward 1., William
de Brewes was indicted for insulting a Judge, con-
fessed and Submitted to the King’s pleasure. He was
sentenced by the Council to, go ungirdled, with bare
head and coif laid aside, through- the courts in
Westminster Hall, confess his fault to the insulted
Judge,, and ■ make ,-him satisfaction, and afterwards,
for the contempt done to the King and his Court,
to be Committed to the Tower during, the King's
pleasure. At the Salisbury Assizes in 1631 a pri-
soner condemned for theft threw a brickbat at the
Judge. It narrowly missed. The prisoner’s right
hand was cut off and fixed to the gibbet on which he
was presently to be hanged. As late as 1799 this
barbarous penalty 1 - was imposed for a somewhat simi-
lar offence.
A modern English instance of contempt in the face
of the Court was provided by an American, Robert
Cosgrave, who, having lost his lawsuit, expressed
his disapproval bv throwing an egg at Vice-Chancellor
Malihs on March 16, 1877. The story goes that die
Vice-Chancellor turned to Mr. Glasse, Q.C., and said:
“What was that?” The reply was “An egg.” The
Vice-Chancellor: “Where did it come from?” To which
Mr. Glasse replied, “A hen, I think, my Lord.” An-
other version of the classic event is that the Vice-
Chancellor remarked, “There must be some mistake.
This is not intended for me, but for my brother
Bacon.” Whichever yarn is correct the result to Cos-
grave was that he was committed to Holloway Prison
and didn’t emerge for five months, when he was
placed on the good ship Utopia and returned to
New York.
“BOX ON.”
“My wife says she never knows what I will do next.”
“So long as she doesn't know what you did last, you are safe.”
“Hamer”: The other day Gibson, P.M.G.,
remarked in regretful tones that the people
of Australia did not seem to know . the con-
veniences the P.O. extended; any person pay-
ing fourpence at a post-office and hand-
ing over a stamped letter could have it de-
livered by special messenger directly it
reached the office to which it was addressed.
With this assurance fresh in my mind, I tried
in Sydney, at a few minutes to 12, to have a
letter delivered in that way at suburban
Kogarah. I explained the concession which
Gibson declared to exist, and the postal
official courteously agreed that it did exist
—in theory. But he pointed out that as a
hard matter of fact whether I paid four-
pence or not, the letter would not be deliv-
ALIMONY.
THE RESPONDENT: “You are equally to
blame. You have never taken the trouble
to find out my real worth.”
THE PETITIONER: “Never mind, my lawyers
will attend to that immediately.”
ered until the following morning’s letter
delivery, so that I might just as well let it
go by ordinary post. I suppose I-ought to
be thankful; he might have taken my four-
pence without telling me.
"Jack Cato” on the Australian in S’Africa:
In his explanation of why Australians are not
popular “in the mass” in S’Afriea, “Centurion”
omits a point that was driven home to us Australians
who lived for many years in that country.
Let me picture Adderley-street, Cape Town, as 1
saw it. A wide thoroughfare about a mile long,
with shops, cafes; banks' and hotels, and the roadway
lined with native flower-sellers; the street filled
with smart women who pride themselves considerably
on their Dutch and Huguenot blood; a thousand well-
behaved Aussies loitering along the footpaths seeing
the sights. And then the deluge! Up the centre of
the road rolls a well-bottled Australian from a troop-
ship, with a giggling black Kaffir woman on either
arm, followed by another lusty hero with a Hottentot
frau. And in their “picnic” mood the boys laugh
at the joke of it! But to the colonists of South
Africa it is disgusting and abominable. The unthink-
able, the unutterable, the unforgivable, has happened.
Towards dusk small groups of Aussies and nigger
women talk and jest on the street corners. This hap-
pened hundreds of times, and the local folk were re-
volted by the sight of it. To them it was as bad as
bestiality. In fact, worse; because, outnumbered 10
to 1, the white man’s only hope in S’Africa is to
maintain his racial status.
A handful of Aussies, mere youngsters, after a
month of troopship monotony, and fuddled with a new
drink, gave us an unenviable reputation; and it was
a feeling of distrust rather than of actual hostility
which led S’Africa to look coldly on the visits of
Australian soldiers even during the Great War. ■

“The'Rumpus”: The periodical row which
has started in Perth over the site for a new
Town Hall recalls a legend of the present
structure. When it was being built by con-
vict labor in the late ’sixties the masons
surreptitiously worked in the brand of the
broad arrow and the hangman’s rope. Eight
arrows figure on the tower corners in the
form of blind windows, and, as the top
adornment of the windows above the four
clock-dials, what are presumably intended to
represent short lengths of manila appear
in the masonry. There is said to have been
a terrible shindy when the grim jest was
discovered, but the municipality has never
bothered to obliterate the convict imprint.

“Centurion”: “Winkle’s” testimony to an
R.C. padre (B. 3/5/’23) recalls Father
McGinnis (let us say) of the 101st Light
Horse. Just after he joined, the Anzac
Mounted Divis'on began to push Jacko out
of Sinai. During the deadly night-marching
which precluded the sanguinary little day-
light scraps of Bir-el-Abd, Magdhaba and
liafa, the padre made it a habit to scurry
up and down the marching columns in the
mirk of midnight. “Is there any Catholic
here that’d loike to confiss?” he would chirp.
“There’ll- be a battle in th’ marnin’ an’ yeez
may all be did be noonday. Oi’ll confiss
anny man his sins.” It was dll quite cor-
rect, I have no doubt, but as a sweetener to
that two-o’eloek-in-the-morning feeling, into
which the A.L.H. fell so often in those days,
it had its,drawbacks.

AT THE WEDDING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A ring upon her finger showed:
I saw a gnarled and work-grimed hand;
A shabby figure in the road,
Before the church she took her stand
And watched the radiant bride conie out.
I wondered what she thought about.
For in her face I marked a glow,
As mem’ry stirred some vision old
Of happy days of long ago,
When youth was young and life was gold.
No sign of bitterness it shed
For happiness long lost and dead.
So old joy in .us lives and stirs.
Whatever sorrows may have flowed
Drowning the gladness that was hers,
A ring upon her finger showed,
And in her face a glad light glowed....
Our joys we have and ever hold.
Oh, priceless little band of gold!

“Kotom”: Because a medical officer of the
N.S.W. Education Department’s staff made
a diagnosis that it took two other doctors
and a Macquarie-street specialist to prove
wrong, “Fitzwilliam” (B. 25/4/’23) sweep-
ingly condemns the whole system of medical
inspection of country school children. None
the less, in hundreds of instances the doc-
tor’s visits to far-back schools could be
shown to have been of inestimable benefit
to the youngsters, and the benefit would be
more pronounced if the average parent were-
only more solicitous or less complacent about
his ch.ldren’s health. Every teacher of ex-
perience knows of cases where throat com-
plaints and adenoids dull otherwise promis-
ing careers, and he knows, too, <the appall-
ingly high percentage of scholars whose defec-
tive" eyesight unfits them for study without
artificial aids. Country parents usually are
ignorant of such defects, and it is only
through the Department’s medical inspector
that attention is likely to be drawn to such
cases before the evil becomes deep-seated.
“Kip”: Recent pars, about travelling on
foreign railways without a ticket remind
me of a baksheesh journey my cobber and
I had on the Alexandria-Cairo express. Me
employed the “no compree” method. About
15 kilos out from Alex, the Gyppo conduct r
made his apologetic appearancej and, noting
our uniforms, asked in English for our
tickets. Surprised at finding himself unin-
telligible, he addressed us in French. Still
no trace of illumination appeared on our
puzzled faces, as, in meaningless jargon, we
pretended that we were trying to assist one
another to arrive at his meaning. Becoming
desperate, he came at us with Greek —with
no better results. Finally, losing all patience,
he opened out in h ; s native tongue. A glim-
mer of understanding was on my cobber s
face as he sprang enthusiastically to his
feet. Thereupon the Gyppo ceased his tirade
and heaved a long sigh of thankfulness. But
it was premature. Bill’s hand produced no
ticket; it merely reached for a bag of oranges
lying in the rack and extended it graciously
towards the linguist. This was the last
straw for Mohammed. He sank backwards
into the corridor, whence, for some consider-
able time, we could hear him faintly callirg
on Allah for support. But he didn’t bother
us any more.
AS FAR AS POOR NATURE WILL LET THEM.
“Your cousin’s a doctor, isn’t she? But 1 suppose she doesn't
practise much.”
“No, not much. We relatives do all we can. But, of course, we can’t
he ill all the time.”
“Collonna”: The imaginative gifts cf many
members of the A.1.F., while they were in
England, have meant a lot of extra work for
the staff of the Queensland Supreme Court
—and, I suppose, the courts of other States
as well. By every mail from England in-
quiries come to hand for the estale of a
deceased “great-uncle” or “grandfather” or
“a second cousin of my mother’s aunt,” who
d : ed “somewhere in Australia,” invariably,
leaving a “big fortune.” One vaguely sus-
pects that the inquiry about this vast y enlth
is the outcome of some genial Digger s
attempt to satisfy the curiosity of English
families concerning long-lost relatives who
came to this country. But so far, m Queens-
land, at least, out of numerous applications
only two estates have been found that corres-
pond to the descriptions given. In one the
“fortune” amounted to £57 and in the other
to £ll3. Moreover, in each case the de-
ceased left a wife and family.

“Cartot”: One danger that has apparently
been overlooked in the Hickson Mission is
that of the trans-
mission of disease
from one sufferer
to another by the
laying-on of hands.
T h e operator’s
method is to touch
lightly with the
tips of his fingers
the site of the
patient’s affliction,
after which he
passes on to the
next sufferer. Many
of those presenting
themselves are suf-
fering from malig-
nant ulcers, open
sores and other
similar ills, some of
which are most cer-
tainly infectious in
their nature. A few
days ago I saw
amongst a crowd of
patients one with
a n unmistakable
syphilitic rash on
his neck. Also,
there is the risk of
the missioner trans-
ferring the causa-
tory organisms of
such a disease as
conjunctivitis from
an infected to an
uninfected person
when he lays bn
hands for eye con;
plaints. No doctor
in his senses would
pass from one case
to another, when
actual contact was
involved,, without
thoroughly washing
and sterilising his
hands. Hickson
himself may be im-
mune to infection,
but that doesn’t
preclude the possi-
' bility of his being
a “carrier.”
“Womerah”: At the intev-State teachers
conference N.S.W. Education Minster
Bruntnell lamented that there was a short-
age of teachers trained'in agriculture, lhe
traditional Barnacles of his department seem
,to have let him down badly. There are close
on 50 teachers in the service who were
trained at the
Ilawkesbury Agri-
cultural College,
and many supple-
mented that train-
ing at techn’eal col-
leges. These men
were selected from
the Teachers’ Col-
lege for thdr out-
standing ability in
science and nature-
study, and cost the
State £lOO a year
for special trai’drg
at the agricultural
college. I am me
of the deluded ones
who missed a uni-
vers i t y career
through following
the will-o’-the-w'sp
agricultural course.
These speci'lly-
trained teachers
are at the Minis-
ter’s service, but
may be found domg
hack work in the
primary schools —
except tlmso that
were snapped up by
the alert education-
ists in Maoriland.
“N.A.E.”: I saw a lady coming up Mar-
ket-street last week with a little woolly dog
'n her arms. The small animal had a
gloomy expression, and eyed passers-by
§ourly; and when another woman carrying
a dog a size larger approached, both ani-
mals showed their teeth, and exh'bited symp-
toms of vulgar animosity which shocked their
refined mistresses. Why should the ladies
have a monopoly of this sort of thin??
Already they have stolen from the allegedly
stronger sex the cane or walking-stick. Why
shouldn’t man retaliate by carrying a cat?
The cat is a domestic animal much more
f>ted bv nature *n be an nrm-pe* than a do*.-
Rhe is more dignified, and of a calmer disposi-
tion, and not so apt to give way to fits of
valor at th£ fancied insults of another of her
tribe. Moreover, her indolent disposition
would render it quite possible for her owner
to sit her on the end of the bar, and reclaim
her after the social rite. , She is also
shrewder than the dog, and not troubled by
any scruples as to honesty—a trait not to
be despised in a travelling compaii-on.
Lastly, she can see in the dark, and this
THE HIGHEST ART.
SHE ( petulantly ): “Oh, you make love like an amateur
THE BOY: “ Thai's where the art comes in!”
gives her a tremendous pull over the dog.
Consider the ass stance she might be, if well
trained, after an evening at the lodge. Of
course the introduction of this social cus-
tom will meet with opposition; but the
pioneers in all great movements have to stand
.that sort of thing.

“Old Scotch”: Temple Court, in Collins-

of the trustees of the late George Hurst,

Tttle offices carrying a total rental of £3249
per annum, was once almost ent'rely occu-

From a teacher in ex-German New Guinea:
The language problem in a territory which con-
tains many tribes, each with its own tongue, becomes
more difficult with the advent of a new master
peope. And here in late German New Guinea the
difficulties are still greater on account of the pro-
longed occupation by the Germans, who incorpo-
rated much of their tongue into the languages of
the native peoples. An official of great experience
says there are no less than 342 kiown tongues in
this territory. Here, in the first Government native
school established under the Australian rSgime, there
are upwards cf 22 languages amongst 77 punils.
In the vast district of Eitape, on the N.G. main-
land, one finds a different tongue in each of the sub-
districts of Paup, Ulau, Yakamul, Margus, Su,an
and others, with innumerable branches or dialects
of each. The necessity for a medium for trade pur-
poses, etc,, has been responsible for. thei remarkably
. rapid spread .among the hatives. of the absurdity
known as “pidgin.’’ It is useful;. there are many
who will argue that it is desirable. But 1 can
assert from experience in. teaching that the native
child learns the puTe English as readily as he does
“oidgin.” . There is no philological basis for a
“dialect” which uses the combination “lukbuk” (look-
b-ok) to express the idea of reading, which prefers
the much more difficult “Me no savee Ibngen” for
“I don’t know,” which cannot be written and under-
stood clearly, and' which.has.not ever will
ar.y literature or tradition. In spite of common
assertion's to the contrary; to the newcomer vhaccUs-
tomed to varietv of languages, and com f ng from a
conservative uni-lingual country, “pidgin” presents
difficulty enough. I personally was more, easily able
to explain ordinary things in French after , six
months’ residence in the country of that tongue than
I am able to do here in “pidgin.” But, unlike
French and the written tongues, “pidgin is too
fundamenta.ly narrow to ever be of universal use
in those parts of this territory which will eventually
become enlightened. There are scores of common
thoughts that “pidgin” is incapable of expressing,
and miscarriages of justice and misunderstandings be-
tween white man and natives,; amongst other things,
are consequent on its use. . * ■
“Bronze”: “G.D.M” (B. 10/5/’23) com-
plains that there is no "stoned ani-
mated bust” of Captain Cook in Melbourne h
streets. True, but there is a more than lTe-
size bronze of the great navigator at &t.
Iviida, a replica of the one at v\ mtbj
(Yorks). With the exception of the bronze
of “Chinese” Gordon in Spring-street it as
the best of Melbourne’s public monuments,
and it has the advantage over the Gordon
monument in the appropriateness of its set-
ting. Gordon looks vainly for the column
that never came in the direction of the Home
and Territories Department, but Cook at
least gazes out over salt water. *
“W.J.H.” : Memories of the extirpation pi
the old-time bushranger in N. S. Wales are
awakened by the announcement of the sale
of the well-known pastoral property ol
McGlede brothers at Wantabadgery. near
Junee, to Gordon William McKinnon; the
land that has just changed hands had been
in the McGlede family for over 50 years: At
McGlede's homestead on Nov. 15,1871), Moon-
light and Ins gang made their last, stand
against the Wagga and Gundagai police.
Constable Bowen, of Gundagai, was shot,
and died from wounds. A youngster of the
gang, named Wreneckie, was killed, and
another, Nesbit, later died of wounds. The
remaining four* “Moonlight” (Captain
Scott), Kogan, Bennett and Williams, were
captured. Moonlight and liogan were
hanged at Darhughurst in Jan., 1880;
the youth of Williams and Bennett won
them life sentences.
“Derry” on some interesting strangers: —
Exiles from Erin, have an odd gift for getting the
feet of authority entangled in red tape, and for
putting • Governments in costly ' false positions. Aus-
tralia had an experience in this line when Osmond
Esmond arrived in Sydney, and, being forbidden .to
land, dangled over the side of a mailboat for. weeks
conducting propaganda against ptughfesism. In Eng-
land Art O’Brien (whose friends; by the way.V re-
cently burned down the ancestral home of the
Esmond patriot) has just, manoeuvred a Cabinet Min-
ister into a position from Which nothing but a
special Act of Parliament can/save : him. And Syd-
ney has Father O’Flanagan, Miv O’Kelly and an
indigenous republican nanied Clancy. So -fay they
are involved with a Federal Board and a State
police-court. Bruce is being attacked by the L.O.h.
and P.D.A. for having let the envoys into Australia,
and the N. S. Wales Government is at issue with
Queensland Nationalism for having krfested the pair
on the eve of the election, instead of letting them
go north and act as powder and shot against Theo-
dorism. The Federal and State Governments are
enraged with each other over the business, and they

A Gallery man watches the procession :
Two or three years ago one commonly heard that
Austin Chapman could never stand another spell of
office. He has now been at the Customs for two
or three months, and is looking cheerier every week.
You can see him moving briskly up to his office in
Spring-street along with the swarms of civil servants
at 9 a.m. The conscientious Gibson, who is capable
of any shift to dodge the limelight, may be noticed
bustling along at the same hour, his brows puckered
up over the problem of making two telephones ring
where one rang before. Earle Page has probably
been chest deep in documents half-an-hour earlier,
and it has been recorded in Bowden’s favor that he
couldn’t prolong an early-morning game of tennis
beyond 7.30, because he had to “get to the office.”
It is quaint to compare the industry of these Minis-
ters with the languor of some of their immediate
subordinates, who reckon that 10 is an ungodly hour
to get “a feller” to toil these wintry mornings.
“Zabut”: Lowell Thomas, in his lectures
in Australia, almost deified Col. Laurence,
but was silent about two notable men who
were associated with him—Colonels Joyce
and Newcome. Had Thomas told a complete
HAMILTON WEBBER, Hugh Ward's musi-
cal director in Melbourne —at present at
the New Palace.
taler Airs ferafeu might how- he lioni&mg-Ncw-
come, here on immigration business! The
Turkish estimate of the three men was that
each was worth £lOOO dead or alive to the
lucky captor. Col. S. F. Newcome, R.E.—-
“Skin Face” to his intimates—was the only
one of the three to be captured, ard some
Australians were taken with him. That was
late in 1917, when he was out on one of the
wild schemes which only men of his type
could conee ve and carry out. They put up
a fight against big odds, but were over-
whelmed. Newcome escaped from the Turks
with the aid of the lady who is now his wife.
William Lathlain’s long tenure of the
mayoralty of Perth —he was in his sixth suc-
cessive year of office-terminated the other
day abruptly. The trouble arose over a new
town hall s te; for a quarter of a century
the Westralian capital has been convinced
that its dingy old brick Guildhall, a relic of
the convict days, is a misfit. But wherever
it was proposed to place the new Town Hal’.
Vested Interests that wouldn’t profit and Lai d
Values that wouldn’t be enhanced rose up
and cursed. In desperation, Lathlain evolved
a definite plan, and secured an option (for
£60,000) on a fine block of land in Si.
George’s-terrace, quite as central as most
sites that could be suggested, and perhaps
more picturesquely situated than any. Then
he asked the Council to endorse his choice.
By a small majority it refused ; whereupon
he resigned, and, re-nominating, appealed to
the ratepayers for a mandate. All the influ-
ences that v anted the Town Hall somewhere
else than where Lathlain proposed to have
it combned against him; and, desnite tie
prestige he had accumulated in five years of
service, he bottomed the poll, scoring hardly
a fifth of the votes.
Dr. Ph lip Mapleston, who specialised in
Tropical Medicine for many years and did
fine work in Queensland and the islands, is
now engaged at the S.r Alfred Jones Re-
search Laboratory in Sierra Leone, West

to spend the next
few years on that
dreadful coast.

Death stepped in and blue-pencilled a
statement in last week’s Bulletin that Mon-
signor and Archdeacon Beechinor, of Launces-
ton and Devonport (Tas.), would shortly
celebrate their diamond jubilee as priests.
While the par. was in the press Monsignor,
Beechinor, the elder brother, died at the
Presbytery, Launceston. All Tasmania liked
the kindly old cleric, who would have been
89 in August. After being orda’ned in
Home in 1863 and ministering awhile in
Dublin, he reached Hobart Town in 1866.
Fifteen years later he went to Launceston
and stayed there. The diamond juoilee he
cb'dn’t celebrate would have happened on
May 27.
“Macquarie Street’s” diagnosis -
The case of Mr. Bonar Law shows .how eagerly place-
hunters keep their eye on the movements of celebrated
specialists. The mere arrival Of Sir Thomas Horder
in Paris, for the purpose of examining' his patient
after his sojourn on the Riviera, was enough to set
all torgues wagging. One fact was evident: that
complete rest and a holiday in a sunny climate had
not produced a favorable effect upon the Prime
Minister’s health, or he would bate crossed the
Channel to consult his medical attendant. Also it
was cabled that he could not fulfil any social engage-
ments in Paris, not even to lunch with President
Millerand. " Mr. Bonar Law’s unannounced arrival
in London must have been on the advice of Sir
Thomas Horder. It was noticed that he had to
lean upon his friends for support on proceeding from
the train to his car. Ordinary affections of the
larynx would not produce the feebleness that he is
evidently suffering from, although we were informed
that it was for loss of voice that he was ordered to
leave England. Loss of voice may be due to affec-
tions of the vocal cords, such as inflammation,
acute or chronic, growths, etc., but it may also be
due to pressure on a recurrent laryngeal nerve (the
left, as a rule), through serious disease in the chest,
and one thinks in practice of aneurism, dr a medi-
astinal growth, when paralysis of a vocal cord l is
diagnosed by means of the laryngoscope. If the
complaint had originated in the larynx, we would
doubtless have heard of Sir St. Clair Thomson, Sir
Pjundas . Grant or Mr. William.. Tilley being called,
in consultation, but the cables are silent with regard
to the opinions of leading laryngologists. At all
events, the malady appears to be non-operative and
very serious.
The passing of Fife Atkinson in Mel-
bourne recently recalled the fight he and a
small band of followers put up 40 years ago
for funeral reform. Gradually the idea
caught on and such atrocities as towering
plumes, black velvet overcoats on horses, black
crepe streamers on the hats of the mourners
and refreshments at the house before and after
the burial, were dropped one by one or in a
heap. Tommy Bent, afterwards Brenner,
was among the stalwarts who supported
Atkinson, but Bent’s own funeral, in 1909,
was one of the “grandest”—a word of his
own —Victoria has ever had. It was ordered
by Murray and Watt —who were mainly re-
sponsible for shifting Tom from the Treasury
bench —and tne State footed the bill.
George Barber, Labor M.L.A. for Bunda-
berg (Q.), is not a fastidious dresser. One
of bis canvassers, whose name had a smell
of bog about it, called on a doubtful female
elector, seeking her vote. “But I couldn’t
vote lor a man like him,” she replied, “lx)ok
at his shabby trousers!” “Ah yes, madam,”
he agreed, “but they cover a warm heart.”
North Gippsland is mourning Norman
Mci-ean, the 71 -year-old sport who was run
over by a taxi in Melbourne after the public-
schools’ b< atrace. He was a brother of
Allan, who was Vic. Premier in 1899-1990
anu was George Re.d’s offs.der in the Federal
Coalition Ministry of 18 years ago. Maffra
is the home town of the clan.
Gone west at 77, Robert Sadler—“Affable
Bob'’—one of Launceston’s most popular
cit.zens. The son of James Sadler, who was
an early alderman of the city, Bob was in
turn general merchant, sharebroker and
director of several good div.-paying mining
properties, lie was chairman of the Stock
Exchange when he d.ed. He became an aider-
man in 1894, and continued one for 27 years,
being mayor in Queen Vic.’s Diamond Jubilee
year. Launceston made him an M.L.A. in
1900, and went on doing it, after the city
became a portion of Bass, until he retired
last year. For nearly 40 years he was on
the committee of the T.T.C., and was a
part owner of Silvermine, which finished
second in both Melbourne and Caulfield
Cups.
S. Aus. lost a good old sport when A. J.
(“Joker”) Barker went out the other day
at 64. Till about 20 years ago he was a
member of the Barker Bros, stock-dealing
firm in Adelaide (John Barker, chairman of
the S.A.J.C., is his brother) and a promi-
nent cross-country rider. Then paralysis
badly affected his power of moving and his
hearing; but he pluckily made reading and
writing fill his life during the long disable-
ment. His widow is a Tasmanian Bowman.
Archgaiters Riley, of Perth, will be 69
on May 26. He is one of Australia’s most
popular prelates. Appointed to his see in
1594, he has been for nine years an archbishop.
He went to the war as Chaplain-General,
and got an 0.8. E.; is Chancellor of W.A.
’Varsity, and has been Grandmaster of the
Freemasons for so long that the oldest in-
habitant finds it hard to remember when he
took on the job.
Headed for the Pearly Gates, the Rev.
J. J. Knipe, one of the pioneers of the Pres-
byterian Church in Queensland. Born in
Ireland 85 years ago, he was appointed by
the Board of Missions to visit Australia when
lie was about 28. He went straight to Mary-
borough, up north, and anchored there for
over 50 years.
The Ballarat Anglican Synod will be as
flat as last night’s beer now. that parson F.
Stillwell has resigned the incumbency of St.
Stephen’s, Portland, to take the job of organ,
iser and sec. to the Diocesan Board in
Groperland. The recognised leader of the
country clergy, Stillwell used with great per-
sistency to marshal his forces in opposition
to the policy of rather autocratic Bishop
Maxwell-Gumbleton; and he had freqfient
clashes with Best, who was deputed to hurl
most of the imported Gaifers’ bricks. Exas-
perated by the cool logic of his opponent, as
he shattered some scheme for increasing the
power of the Bishop, the latter was some-
times driven to try sarcasm, generally • with
disastrous results; to himself. It was re-
cently hinted that if there was less opposi-
tion from Portland there would be a canon
there ; but the village Hampden retained his
soul. ’ Stillwell didn’t live in the church —
he has been president of the hospital com-
mittee, ■ and for the past three years a live
member of the borough council.
“Weetona”: May I correct the para-
graph (B. 3/5./’23) about ex-Postmasters-
General to the extent of pointing out that
Sydney Smith (who. held the office in Reid’s
1904-05 Ministry) is still hale and hearty?
Not only that, but he still manifests a keen’
interest in politics, and never neglects a
yearly pilgrimage to the grave, of his old,
chief, Henry Parkes. During the war he was
an active worker for patriotic movements.
Four of his boys were on active service; the
youngest (Harold) went west at Lone Pine.
“Van Cat”: Wilton Hack, who passed
out at Beverley (W.A.) recently, was a S.
Australian and a jack of many trades and
-professions. He studied for the Baptist min-
istry and kept the pot boiling the while as a
drawing-master at Prince Alfred College,
Adelaide, having among his pupils the after-
wards, famous Mortimer Mempes. He went
at his own expense to Japan as a missionary
to convert the heathen ; but the heathen con-
verted him and he became a Buddhist. Then
India called him and he became a Theoso-
phist and a friend of Annie Besant. His just
wish, to be cremated, startled the rustics of
Beverley. There being no conveniences in
the place the job was handed over to the ioeal
poundkeeper, and he carried it out on tne
spot where the defunct cows of the ullage
are incinerated.
FAITH.
EGBERT : “Do you think this layin' on of
hands can ever cure anything, Sam?"
SAM: "Well, if I could lay ’ands on five hot
I believe it'd do me thirst a lot o' good."
Died in Wellington, aged 89, James T.oekie,
the doyen of Maoriland contractors. A Scots
man from Ayrshire, he joined the rush of
50 years ago to the goldfields of Otago, but
found building paid better. He put up the
old Theatre Itoyal in Wellington, and the
railway bridge over the Rangitikei River,
and a hundred other things in stone and iron.
And in between times lie published some
weighty pronouncements on street-widening,
and “skipped” bowling rinks with immense
success.
Anither Scot scores. Ronald McDonald, head
teacher of Moreland (Vic.) State school, has
been elected by the teachers as their delegate
on the Department’s committee of classifiers.
Men with names like Braithwaite, Robinson
and Smith had no chance against him. The
Macs are getting everything they want, and
nobody bothers to suggest that they should
be handicapped, say, 20 per cent., because
they’d certainly find some way of catching
up.
The widow of an old-time N.S.W. Parlia-
mentarian, James Augustine Cunneen, passed
out at 85 the other day in Paddington, where
she had lived 40 years. She was a Windsor
native, her father, Henry Hudson, being
interested in stage coaches running between
Windsor and Sydney. Cunneen represented
the Hawkesbury, 1860-09, and Wollombi,
1872-77, and was P.M.G. without a Cabinet
seat in the Cowper Ministry of just-on 60
years ago.
“Muzzie”: Touching that par. by “The
Oldest” (B. 10/5/23) re James Harrison.
He certainly invented ice-making, but his
experiments and successes were achieved on
the banks of the Barwon, near Geelong, and
not in Melbourne. His connection with the
Age was mainly as a contributor, but he was
the first, editor of the Geelong Advertiser.
Nor is his grave at Geelong unmarked. Not
long since, the Association of Refrigerating
Engineers laid a wreath thereon. They are
also considering a proposal to found a James
Harrison scholarship.
A. B. Moncrieff, 0.E., who was S.A.’s
Engineer-in-Chief for many years, and then
Railways-Commissioner, was 78 on May 22.
Maoriland lost its oldest parson when
Canon Frank Gould shifted from Gisborne
to Petersville recently, aged 96. He was
ordained before going to the Shaky Isles to
help the hard-working Bishop Selwyn 75
years ago.
“Xox”: Michael Considine, ex-M.H-.R., is
bearing the loss of his £lOOO a year with a
philosophy born of previous adversity. Dur-
ing his spell in Parliament he acquired a
poultry-farm, and is now fattening birds at
Blackburn (Vic.). The enterprise is be-
ginning to return him a fair living. In addi-
tion lie has opened out as an insurance
auent with encouraging success. Nowadays,
Considine doesn’t talk so glibly of the benefi-
cent effects of Soviet rule. In fact, if any
attempt were made to Bolshevise his fowls
he’d probably be the first to spring for a gun.
THE ARMCHAIR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here from this cosy armchair by the fire
Each thing seems rare, and warm, and beautiful!
I can believe the crowded world a 1 good ;
Can think of happy people and the flowers,
Slender and sweet, from rich old garden-beds ;
Of pictures and the smell of fresh-brewed tea
Swimming in hollowed Wedgwood, and the sound
Of clii king spoors in saucers; and the drip
Of glowing ashes falling silveily.
Here God is very real, benignant, good,
A placid Presence hovering around
The teacups with a large contented smile 1
But I —but I am sick to death of washed
Hypocrisies! This is not all, I know!
This is not all —the shameful armchair lies!
I know that there are things unspeakable—
Dark, stinking streets with slimy gutters where
The children feed on filth, pale-eyed and wan ;
And tottering houses where the drunken man,
Lustful and loud, kicks at his cowering wife;
And there are girls with weary feet who climb
Innumerable stairs—pale girls who bend
Above lorg tables in a whir of wheels,
And pack unending tins day after day,
Day after day, where nothing ever comes ;
And crowded wards of hospitals marked out
In beds —white beds with faces o’er the sheets
Ravaged and torn beneath the lash of pain,
Frightful and hungry and malevolent!
And yet this cursed chair all softly sprung
Would have me think that it is otherwise!

“Yarrum”: I once saw a white man np
uo his pockets in the Queanbeyan River (N.S.W.)
spearing wild ducks. Many of the birds, when
moulting-, can’t fly, and
they hide in the weeds to
dodge men and foxes. I've
seen and caught ducks in
the herbage fringing Lake
George, and they’ve had
HADN’T

scarcely a feather. The drakes don’t shed their
clothes anything like So recklessly as the ducks, and
are, consequently, rarely captured. Curiously
enough, before a severe winter, the birds don’t
moult to any extent.

“John Moran”: Away back on Jan. I<X
1907, “The Proosian” told the Council about a set-
tler’s child being slimed all over by a carpet-snake.
I ridiculed the yarn (B. 7/2/’O7), and explained just
how a snake does swallow its prey, whereupon a gang
of Abo.-liars jumped on me. I had often wondered
how a snake got big rats or birds down, when they
were perhaps four or five times the diameter of the
wriggler’s neck, and one day I was lucky enough to
notice the action of the snake’s lower jaws, just as
I described in my par. Last week one of my boys
sent me a book called “Reptiles of the World,” by
Raymond L. Ditmars, and this is what he says on
page 197:
Among snakes the lower jaw is not single, as with
lizards; it is composed of two .elongated, nearly
straight, bones, that are connected in tne front merely
by an elastic ligament. This swallowing apparatus
of the serpent shows marked specialisation among
reptiles. The process of engulfing the prey is ex-
tremely simple and ingenious, though little under-
stood. About this characteristic has originated a
string of ridiculous stories. Usually the prey is
grasped by the snout when the performance com-
mences. One of the lower jawbones reaches for-
ward, inserting the recurved teeth, and is then pulled
back, drawing the animal a short distance into the
mouth. The process is repeated on the other side,
each side working in alternation while the quarry
is pulled into the mouth and forced down the throat,
which, being very elastic, stretches to receive it.
That is precisely what I told the Council 16 years
ago, and shows the sliming crowd who wanted to
swallow me that their collective name is Mud.
“Molokihi”: - The cane-knife for head-
cutting is still used in the west of Papua. This
primitive yet effective weapon is simply a concave
blade of dry bamboo fitted with a handle. When
required for use a small nick is made in the blade
close to the handle and a strip torn off, leaving a
new raw edge sufficient to hack off the victim’s head
after the vertebrae have been fraqtured by bending.
Naturally the new edge can be used only once, and a
fresh strip has to be removed before each operation.
One knife in my possession shows the recent removal
of 11 such strips. Yet one reads in the Southern
press that head-collectirg has lost its charm for the
Papuan. Some of us know better.
* * * #
“Spinifex”: Re “Curlew’s” suggested
curses for rain (B. 26/4/’23). There may be some-
thing in it. Old-timers in Queensland tell of a
squatter who decided, near the tail-end of a big
drought, to re-ropf the station storeroom, which hap-
ened to be well stocked at the time. Just when the
old roof was removed, it began to rain. The old
man stalked out in the open, shook his fist at the
leaking skies, and told Providence exactly what he
thought about it. The more fluently he expressed
himself, the harder it rained; and the harder it
rained the more fluent’y he expressed himself. It
was a queer contest; but the rain won hands down.
“Sarto”: There’s something comically
human about birds, as witness a family squabble
opposite my place the other evening. Mrs. Magpie
had gone to roost for the night in her accustomc-d
tree, when presently along came the old man and
a cobber and tried to get in too. The missus
objected and kicked them both out. They flew to an
adjacent tree and had a few words together; then
back they went again. Out again quicker than the
first time. Another consultation, and back again—
and out again. Then they talked it over for awhile
and the old man went back on his lown and got in.
His cobber spent a lonely night in the other tree. By
the language I concluded the two blokes had been on
the spree.

“S.T.S.”: It was curious how differently
fowls and turkeys acted when aeroplanes first began
to come about. Ours were reared in a
large seaside town, and had very likely
never seen a hawk in their lives; but in-
stinct counts, and before the first ’plane
was overhead the birds—living together
in the same large pen—had followed the
tradition of their respective tribes. In
two seconds there wasn’t a fowl in sight
—all had run for cover, screaming for
help. But the turkeys huddled together
in the open, following the enemy round
with a solemn gaze as if all their heads
were operated by one neck ; silent, except
for a kind of muttering by which they
were probably exhorting each other to
stand firm. And no length of experience
that the flying monster was harmless
taught either breed anything. The pri-
vate aerodome just behind the town did
a roaring business in 20-minute trips out
to sea and back; but all hands in the
poultry-peh went through their respective
drill every time a ’plane went up.

“Azac”: “Snail” (B. 19/4/’23) is cer-
tainly looking for argument when he introduces the
question of the fastest animal. A greyhound can run
a rabbit or a hare down simply because these two are
non-stayers. Over a short course there is little
between the three. Again, a horse has to be speedy
to keep up with a greyhound over, say, a furlong,
but at a mile the horse wins easily. The kargaroo
has been credited with high speed, but it is only
his ability to negotiate rough country that makes
him show up when opposed to animals less used to
such a rough passage. So pass out all the fore-
going and leave the stage clear for the giraffe, which
has been timed to travel at the rate of 80 miles per
hour. The fastest time made by a racehorse over
one furlong is a little over 10sec., which works out
at about 40 m.p.h. The average racehorse, how-
ever, takes over Imin. 40sec. to run the full mile,
which is under 36 m.p.h. The giraffes were timed
from a motor-car, so the figure should be somewhere
near the mark.

“El Dorado”: Re “Jim Carew” on women
shearers (B. 26/4/’23). The late Mrs. Donald Fraser, of
East Torale (N.S.W.), and daughter of the greatest
of all Da ling country pioneers, John Mackay, could
run the blades over 60 sheep a day, week in, week
out, with an occasional tally of 80—and never leave
a scratch. There are plenty of others I could
name ; but I think this golden-hearted Scotch lassie
was the ringer among her sex.
“Wessel”: Some kind of marsupial tiger
is not the only rare beast that Reg Kendall hopes
to rope in up in N. Queensdand. There is the
Macropus hediordi, of which only one specimen (now
in the possession of the Duke of Bedford) is known
to science. It is a very light-colored wallaby which
has been seen in the scrubs around Cardwell. W.
McLennan has already brought a 10ft. poisonous snake
down \ from Coen, on Cape York Peninsula, but there
are hopes of finding a 14-footer, which would be a
world’s record. There is a photo in existence of
NO CLASS.
NEW CHUM: “Call him a good sheepdog, do you? Why, he’s done
nothin’ hut chase them all day, and I haven’t seen the

what is described as a 14ft. carpet-snake, which
shews the head shape characteristic of the venomous
snakes. As a make-weight there is a spider about
the size of a man’s hand which is said to eat
chickens.
* * # *
“P. le L.”: “El Dorado’s” gruesome curi-
osity (B. 26/4/’23) isn’t as curious as a bovine’s skull
found in the mallee at Wyalong (N.S.W.), about 30
years ago, by a man named Gregson. This showed
the horns embedded in the eye-sockets to a depth of
two or three inches, and, as these natural protuber-
ances don’t make a very speedy growth, the agony
suffered by the animal is beyond imagining.
* * * *
“Spinifex”: I’d like to remark to “Jimmy
Possum” (B. 3/5/’23) that the man who takes a
quarter of an hour to skin an old-man ’roo is a
long way from being an expert, while the fellow who
takes half an hour over the job is an absolute blank.
Skipworth, of Queensland, mentioned in the Abo.
column some time back, always had £lO to say
he could skin any kangaroo in a minute. I’m an
also-ran, but I’d be loafing if I took over five. And
what’s this about waiting till the ’roo kicks the
bucket? If “J.P.” pulls the ’roo’s ears forward and
drives his knife-point into the cavity at the base of
the skull, severing the spinal cord, he needn’t wait.
As to his statement that 40 bear-pelts may be col-
lected in a day, but only 10 ’roos— Oh, James!
Why, I’d sooner skin a ’roo than a bear any day.
But perhaps Jimmy skins ’roos with his little knife.
If so, I’d advise him to niake thh opening cuts, and
follow the advice of. the Sentimental' Bloke. “Put
in th’ boot,” I sez. “Put in th’ boot.”
* * * *
“El Dorado”: If a booby prize was
awarded for an egg-laying competition, then Cocky'
Brown (mentioned in Bean’s “Dreadnought of the
Darling”) would romp home with it. Her record
is 10 eggs in 30 years. The latest was laid last year,
and it, was a pathetic sight to see Cocky trying to
make a nest, gathering bits of rubbish and tucking
them around—really a heart-rending example of
love’s labor lost.
* * * «
“Peanut”: Hickson is not the only faith-
healer hereabouts. The blacks and half-castes at
Huskisson (Jervis Bay) regard him as a mere
plagiarist. Their own healer, a practitioner of some
years’ standing, is a well-educated abo., who lacks
nothing in fiery earnestness and boasts a considerable
following. His procedure is very much that of his
white emulator—hymns, an address, prayer, followed
by the laying-on of hands. But his discourse seems
to be a weird mixture of Bolshevism and Scripture,
for, in addition to exorcising the devils of toothache,
lumbago and housemaid’s knee, he exbo-ts the con-
gregation to arise and “root out the white usurpers
of our land, who molest our women and bring us the
twin curses of rum and tobacco.” I don’t know any-
thing about cures of physical ailments, or whether
some recent large hauls of mullet are (as claimed)
the result of the mission; but I do know that one
or two little disorders brought about by the Bolshie
leaven in the sermon have been successfully treated
by a vigorous laying on of the clenched fists of the
white usurper.
“De Oriel”: Whilst a controversy was
raging on the store verandah at Wijmot (Tas.) on
the high-jumping propensities of sheep, a stranger
droving a flock rode round the corner. He carried
a jumbuck on the .saddle. “Is it knocked UD?
someone called. “Not on your life! ” he answered.
“Got a fright and jumped right into my arms.”

“Key-string”: “Ned Kelly” (B. 19/4/’23)
was handed the dinkum oil when that old-timer told
him the pure-bred dingo never barks. On Wooroo-
woolgen station,
(N.S.W.) I reared one
of a litter I had taken
from a log; and
although I had him
for two years I never
heard him attempt to
bark. He was an ex-
cellent cattle worker,
noiseless, and never
showed the least signs
of fatigue. Two of
us were driving a bull
to another part of the
run one day, when the
beast became snake-
headed and bailed up.
Including Dingo we
had four dogs on him,
and although the yap-
ping of the other three
was almost deafening,
the real Australian
never uttered a sound,
but, by manoeuvring
skilfully and never let-
ting up when an open-
ing offered, he did more
to shift that beast
than all three fancy-
bred cattle-dogs. In-
cidentally, I could lay
hands on him only
while lying on the
ground; he would
come creeping up,
always keeping as low
to the earth as pos-
sible. One night I
failed to tie him up,
and he had a blow-
out on poultry. This
Seemed to awaken his
wild nature, as I could
never catch him again.
and was compelled to shoot the poor devil.
“Yarrum” : “Bad Australian” (B. 3/5/’23)

tion for seven years. Easy. I just waited until they
grew up a bit.

“Ivilwa”: A while back some of the wise-
acres on the Abo. Council smiled at the idea of
snakes milking cows. Well. A lady friend of
mine who was nursing a baby in Africa was awak-
ened one night by something sucking at her breast',
and was horrified to find a snake about 3ft. long
pinching the kid’s supper. The lady is at present
in Maoriland getting over the shock, and any reference
to the incident means another trip for the doctor.

“Jim Carew”: I can’t believe “Dunederra”
(B. 3/5/’23) when he says that rabbit-skins, tacked
furry side outwards, round the legs of a safe, will
keep ants out. Years ago on the Upper Hawkesbury
somebody told me the same yarn, and I tried it.
The ants, mostly meat-ants, chewed the fur oif the
skins and carted it away. Instead of keeping them
cut of the safe it brought more into it.
SURE SIGNS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The drought has been on us for twenty-six weeks;
We’ve had months of mosquitoes and flies ;
There’s nothing but stones on the beds of the ereeks,
And we’ve all got the blight in our eyes;
The newspapers say there is no change in sight,
But to-night as I came up the lane
The cattle were calling,
Some big trees were falling—
We might get a sprinkle of rain.
Our tanks have been empty since last Christmas
Day,
And the old well is just about dry ;
The fires on the hillsides are blazing away
And the smoke hangs all day in the sky;
The sun sets each night in an ocean of red,
But to-night we are hoping again,
For the crickets are singing,
The wild ducks are winging
Far out to the swamps—it might rain.
A drover passed through here a day or so back
On a nag that was jaded and lean;
He left half his mob lying dead on the track,
And lie brought us a young lamb to wean.
So I reckon I’ll give the poor jumbuek a chance,
For to-night, through the dust on the plain,
As daylight was dying
1 saw the swifts flying
Low down near the ground—which means rain.
The bill that we owe to the blokes at the store
Oave even the old man a fright;
They’ve given us credit for six months or more,
But they sent us a “blister” to-night.
The girls are all weeping and Dad’s gone to bed,
But I’ve cleaned out the spouts and the drain.
The drought must be breaking,
For Mum’s corns are aching— :■
It’s blanky well certain to rain.

“Floppy” (N.Q.) : Whether the blacks in
the Gulf country have any knowledge of herbal reme-
dies for gonorrhoea (B. 5/4/’23) I know not,
but I do know that the police often hunt the natives
into the towns to be treated by medical officers.
Many of them are incurable, and only come in to
die. Ihe medical officer at Burketown recently
sent a strongly-worded report to the Bananaland
Government, recommending that the natives be pla< ed
in reservations, and have a special Government Medi-
cal Officer to stamp out the gonorrhoea. At Nor-
manton things are just as bad, and much of the
medicine issued at that place is for the treatment
of this disease, caught in all cases from the natives.
The hospitals in the Gulf area are petitioning the
Government for payment for treatment of the diseased
natives, so Binghi’s knowledge of bush remedies men-
tioned by “X2X” must be confined to a few tribes.

“Molokihi”: We have often wondered
what would be the impressions of a Rip Van Winkle
awakening from the Stone Age into the wonders of
the 20th century. A Papuan bushman supplied
something of an answer for me last week. He had
lately accompanied his plantation boss on a visit to
Sydney, and on my asking him in his own tongue
what his main impressions were, he replied without
hesitation: “Oh, Taubada, in that place I saw plenty
big houses in the sky, and I savvied a little bit. I
been see plenty bush train going all the same wind,
and I savvy a little bit. But that water, that water
on the window of the butcher shop, that water that,
comes from nowhere and goes nowhere —that one I
no savvy at all.”

“Ezekiah” : I disagree with “Yarrum” (B.
5/4/’23) when he plumps for the lyre-bird s solitary
egg. While humping Matilda down south in N.S.W.
UP TO DATE.
"What’s the new girl down the creek like?”
“Good-o! Just press her hand, and she does the rest.”
I came across lyre-birds’ nests frequently. They
often held two eggs, and once, to the<’joy of my
attenuated pantry, I found four, all freshly laid. As
regards determining the sex of the fledglings, I found
the secret by a simple experiment which some
A bos. may scoff at but will find true if they try it.
The vanity of lyre-birds is well known ; so in front
of three fledglings I had caught I held a fragment of
a looking-glass. They all gazed on their youth and
beauty for a minute; then two walked off and one
remained, eyeing its shape and the set of its plumage.
That one I put aside as a member of the weaker sex,
and my decision later proved to be correct. I have
tried the experiment a number of times since, and it
has never failed.
“Mic-Min”: Gently swaying as he ambled
along, “Black Charlie,” sometime police tracker,
steered a zigzag course down our street, his mouth
split by a huge grin which displayed his gleaming
teeth. " “Me drunk as plurry white man,” he con-
fided proudly to passers-by.

“Sarah Anne” : Tell
“Pick” (8.15/2/23) that
youngsters and lunatics
are not the only ones
who have some singular
taming influence on ani-
mals. A relative of mine
was breaking in a colt
noted for his kicking, and
the first day he was rid-
den into town he was tied
up in front of the pub.
An acquaintance hap-
pened to be shickered there
at the time, and my rela-
tive was to see him safely
home. When they went
out to mount, the sozzled
gentleman toppled clean
over his horse and rolled
under the young colt. The
bystanders expected to see
him kicked to pieces, and
shouted a warning. “Garn!”
burbled the beery one, “he
wouldn’t kick me,” and
he got on his hands and
knees and deliberately
crawled under the colt’s
belly, between his front
legs, and then right
through between his hind
legs. The horse had to
spread his rear pins to
enable Beery to get
through, yet never tried to
kick, either then or when
the liquefied idiot rolled
over in the long grass
behind his heels. My rela-
tive and the publican
gasped while these fool
antics were going on, and,
if the former moved for-
ward the celt would lower
his ears, raise a hoof and
prepare to land him one.
“Ben”: Punctured, I was mending hay
bike tyre under the bridge at Wagga (N.S.W.) when
’Bidgee Joe arrived. In addition to Matilda, he had
an old motor tyre round his neck. In answer to my
inquiries about his necklace, Joe informed me that,
cut into shape and tied on, the rubber made AT
sandals. “Boots are bloomin’ ’ard to get off the
cookies now,” he added. I offered him a bottle of
solution, in case he ran out of string. He took it.
“Boori”: It’s time the N.S.W. Fisheries
Dc-pt. put the boot into the annual massacre of the
spawning sea mullet (Mugil
dobula ). About the Easter full
moon each year instinct impels
the matured members of this
tribe, by far the most useful of
Australian fishes, to forsake their
upstream homes and migrate to
the sea to spawn. They are
always in prime condition for
the trip. Once on trek they swim
so closely together that an acre
will accommodate an incredible
number of baskets. Arrived at
the sea they make the fatal mis-
take of dallying on the shallow
grounds of.'.,the estuary, where
nets are always waiting. Like
all honeymooning fools, they for-
get their wiles, and before they
get the hang, of their new loca-
tion twine" feijces are around
them. Few escape. The massacre
(it’s nothing less) goes on at
almost every coastal estuary.
Sometimes stormy weather comes
to their rescue, and that alone
has prevented their already sadly-
depleted numbers from practical
extermination.

“Cab”: Tell “Jim Carew”
that his green grub (B. 26/4/’23)
was quite common on the leaves
of not only wilga, but other
similar trees in the Gobar and
Nyngan (N.S.W.) districts when
I was up that way about 10 years
back. 1 never touched one my-
self, but a cobber claimed to have
been “bitten,” and described the
pain as something like the con-
tinual drip, drip of boiling water
on his hand. It Steadily increased
for some time, and he said a whole day passed before
he was free of it.
“Girofla”: “Herodot’s” suggestion (B.
26 /4/’23) that the frog found in the intestines of a
cow had been there since it was a tadpole is too far
fetched. Notwithstanding the adaptability of the
frog, the alkaline contents and the toxins of the intes-
tines would certainly kill it eventually. Moreover,
a tadpole would most easily be swept on with the
intestinal contents. My view is that the cow swal-
lowed the frog which, struggling in its new surround-
ings, caused acute obstruction of the intestines, a very
painful affliction, for man or beast, and a fatal one
if not quickly remedied by surgical measures. The
ulceration supports the diagnosis, as it merely shows
that the frog had stuck in the one place, thus caus-
ing the obstruction.

60th year. One belonging to Mrs. Pratt, of Bedale,
Yorks, reached 46 years; another owned by Edmund
Deane, of Westmeath, reached 39. The oldest horse
in America was recently the centre of much curiosity.
It is called Clover, is owned by a parson, and
is reported to be 62. It was placed on show in
New York recently and was insured for £lO,OOO
during its sojourn there. But old as Clover is,
it will have to live a further 10 years to get the
world’s record, held by an English barge horse,
which lived to 62.
•» * *
“The Deacon”: Leason’s picture “Going
for a Drive’’ (B. 10/5/’23) brings back to memory
an old horse of pronounced Sabbatarian tendencies
owned by an R.C. priest in a country town. (That
priest was a bishop when he told me the yarn, so it
must be true.) This piece of equine scenery was as
docile as a sheep, and could be caught anywhere and
anvwhen and without difficulty—except on a Sunday.
Then the trouble always began. Half the youth of
the parish would be conscripted after early mass
to run down Robert Emmet, so that his Reverence
might get to the next station. And then they didn’t
always succeed. Various reasons were assigned for
the prad’s refractoriness, his previous possession by a
bigoted Presbyterian being the one generally favored.
* . • . * *
“Nor’-West”: In spite of “Six and Eight”
(B. 3/5/’23), eels have been caught in several of the
western rivers of N.S.W. and Queensland. In 1909, a
friend and I, while camped on the Gwydir River, four
miles from Gravesend,
caught one on a night-
line set for cbd and
baited with a hunk of
rabbit. He was 3 ft.
3in. long, and weighed
3 jib. We sent him
up to the local pub,
where he was exhibited
to the astonished gaze
of the natives. One
expert dubbed him a
silver eel. I know of
two authenticated cases
of eels having been
caught in the Namoi.
To finally clinch the
argument, two—one
weighing over 81b. —
have been caught in
the Severn River, at
Ranger’s Valley station,
Emmaville district. The
superstitious horror
with which the western
binghis are said by
“Jim Care w” (B.
12/4/23) to regard eels
is no doubt attribu-
table to their rarity, and is not so surprising, after
all.
■* •* * *
“Te W.”: Some of the smaller Australian
snakes are most unobtrusive, and rarely seen. Thus
there was some surprise at Tathra (South Coast,
N.S.W.) recently when an 18in. white-lipped snake
(Denisonia coronoides ) turned up near the wharf, hav-
ing probably emerged from the adjacent rocky scrubs
for a sunbath. The white lips render this small but
venomous wriggler easily identifiable. Its habitat,
so far as is known, is N.S.W., Vic., S.A. and VVest-
ralia. The upper parts —bar the head, which is
coppery—are dull black or very dark brown, and the
bell}’ is greyish-white. Its big brother, the copper-
head, or superb snake ( Denisonia superba), is rare
on the coast, but fairly common on the Monaro high-
lands. I have, however, seen a small one near
a South Coast salt lake. This snake may pan out
up to- 6ft., and, like the brown, which it somewhat
resembles in coloring, is deadly. There is no record
of a human being having been bitten by white-
lips, hence his full toxic powers are unknown. There
are at least 18 members of the genus Denisonia,
mostly small species, and including the black-bellied
snake, said to be fairly common in N. S. Wales.
The name of this genus, by the way, is commemora-
tive of Governor Denison.
* * * $
“Titun”: “Six and Eight” (B. 3/5/’23)
need only, go to the Hopkins RiVer, near Warrnam-
bool (Vic.), to see an eel-fare. At Tooram, about
eight miles from the mouth of the river, there is a
chain of rocks from bank to bank, and, standing on
these when the elvers are coming in, it’s possible to
scoop them out in bueketsful. The mature eels
travel down this stream with the first rains of
autumn. Amateur fishermen living near the river
make huge catches at this time with the spear. I
have seen over 2cwt. of eels speared on the rocks
near the railway bridge at Panmure (Vie.).
“Brightun”: Eel-fare happens at irregular inter-
vals in the Narracan, in Central Gippsland (Vic.). I
had the luck to see one in full swing at Narracan
Falls in 1913. The elvers were attempting to negoti-
ate the falls by means of the rocks, but seemed to
be but poor climbers, and the yabbies in the pools
below had a great time. Judging by the number of
young cels found higher up the stream a proportion
of the millions that make the attempt succeed.
“Gumsucker”: “Osrie’s” trumpet-flowered
tree which dilates the iris of a person’s eye (B.
3/5/’23) is a datura, commonly called brugmansia,
and contains an alkaloid called daturine, which is
practically identical in its action with atropine^ —
hence the eye trouble. It belongs to the natural
order Solanaeeae, the commonest member of which
is the thorn apple ( Datura stramonium ).
* * * *
“Numbugga”: Like “Jim C&rew” (B.
3/5/’23j, I’ve closely observed the tomtit that
fashions a resting spot on the top of the domed nest.
As this little tit is often of Mormon habits, and has
two wives and often five young in the nest, the cosy
spot in the air would at least furnish an ideal bunk
for the boss during the night. A nocturnal visit to
the nest will often disturb the user, though whether
it is the male or one of the wives I can’t say.
Close examination reveals that the top storey is it:
constant use.
“D.F.”: One Australian who has not yet been
told how dangerous the tropics are is the little penguin.
He has not reached them yet, but he is working
steadily up the coast, and is due to cross the Tropic
of Capricorn shortly. Twenty years ago his northern
limit was about Sydney; to-day he has reached the
latitude of Brisbane. He is a colonist, too, not a
mere tripper. One favorite breeding-ground is the
quarantine reserve at North Head, Sydney. The
original home of all the penguin family seems to have
been the Antarctic, but none of the others has reached
so far north as the little chap. Incidentally, he is
a friendly and companionable creature. A while ago,
while some fishermen were camped for a time on the
Five Islands, off Illawarra, the penguins took a great
interest in them, and often dropped in to see them
round the camp-fire in the evening. Sometimes there
would be several pairs of penguins sitting with them
in the most amicable fashion.

“Mover”: Re “P.X.” and the “marsupial

gerah Entrance (N.S.W.), one of our party shot a

tiger-cat, of brownish color with dark stripes, and it
had a distinct marsupial pouch. It was a bit larger
than a domestic cat. I had the fur till recently,
and it was much admired. The cat was shot while
climbing a tall gum-tree. They are night prowlers,
which may account for them not being very often
seen. Ours was shot at daybreak. They are evi-
dently a carnivorous species of marsupial and fierce
flighters.
BURNING OFF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Children with shouts and cheering
Pile on the shattered limbs,
Till all the ragged clearing
In tawny radiance swims;
And higher yet and higher,
Tossing its smoky hood,
The braggart, boisterous fire
Tramples the helpless wood.
While light and shadow, leaping,
Like two great cats at play,
Are crouching, springing, creeping,
Feinting in mimic fray,
Mute in the darkness waiting,
The scarred survivors see,
Man and his ally sating
Remorseless enmity.
Doomed beyond hope of saving
They lift wild arms on high,
Some sword of justice craving
From the regardless sky;
And fiercer flames ascending
Light with prophetic glow
Gaunt branches writhing, bending,
Twisted in silent woe.

BEFORE You Buy that Hat
LOOK at the LEATHER LINING
HEN the grazier grows tired of railing at
politicians he falls back on his old aversion
—the man who introduced rabbits into
this continent.
But the cottontail’s account with Australia,
Limited, is not all debit. There
are impressive items on the
credit side.
For instance, a greater
tonnage of frozen rabbit was
exported to allied countries in
1917-18, when the submarine
peril was at its worst, than
that of frozen mutton and
lamb.
Also, the fur in the Aus-
tralian’s felt hat is pro-
vided by the rabbit, or
its 1a r g e*r and less
numerous relative, the
hare. That is true both
of the Australian and
the imported article.
Prior to 1914 the
foreign hat manufacturer was
in almost complete control of
the Australian market. The
position was reversed during
the war years, when there
grew up a fine industry, using
Australian materials, paying
Australian rates of wages, and
capable of magnificent expan-
sion—provided it gets the consideration to
which it is fairly entitled.
Very interesting is the job of converting
rabbit fur into felt hats. All the processes may
be seen at the spacious factory in Bourke Street,
Waterloo (N.S.W.), where the famous AKUBRA
Hats are turned out.
AKUBRA is an old aboriginal term, signifying a
covering for the head,'but there is nothing old about
the machinery used in manufacturing the AKUBRA

Hat. It is the very latest of its kind—more so than
in 95 per cent, of the British mills—and most of it is
made on the premises by Australian mechanics.
The skins are bought at auction as required.
Arrived at the factory, they are sorted according to
grade, damped and packed in
a heap. When sufficiently
pliable they are passed along
to openers (all women), who
slice them down the middle and
remove the heads and tails.
They are then brushed
(Bunny’s overcoat, not
the ladies), and the
long, coarse hair,
which is useless for
felting, but has a cer-
tain value for stuffing
cricket-pads and box-
ing-gloves, is separated
from the fur by machines.
To increase its felting
properties the fur is treated
with a solution of nitrate
of mercury, an qperation
known as carroting. That
done, the carroted skins are
laid on racks and baked at a
high temperature, after which
the fur is brushed again,
stripped from the pelt and
dumped into a cellar to
mature. The maturing process
may occupy twelve months.
Most ingenious is the way in
which the hat body is formed.
A metal cone perforated with
small holes is made to revolve
on its axis over an opening
under which there is. a powerful fan. Beside
the cone is a box from which greyish fur is
expelled by the revolution of a brush-like cylinder,
the movement of which is as rapid as that of the
cone is slow. Drawn to the cone by the current of

air, the fibres form a coating which is kept in position
by the exhaust below. When enough fur has been
deposited to form a hat body it is damped, wrapped
in a cloth, and removed in an outer cone, being then
two or three times the size of an ordinary hat.
Vigorous rolling, pressing and rubbing by hand
and machine cable the hat to shrink 50 per
cent. Leathery at this stage, it is softened in boiling
water, shaped on a wooden block, dyed for two or
three hours (the dyes are British), stiffened in one
machine, tipped in another, blocked again and
smoothed with the finest emery paper. The finish-
ing operations, those of lining and banding the hat,
are performed by girls.
For the beautiful and feathery-light velour hats
—oddly enough, more popular in England than
Australia— special fur is used. The Akubra Co. also
makes wool hats, the wool being carded, wound on
majority are on piecework. One man has been known
to collect £1 7 for his week’s labor. It is by no means
uncommon for a good tradesman to earn £ 1 0 a week.
The company goes on the principle that it doesn’t
mind how much an employee makes so long as he
gives it the equivalent in service and helps it to keep
up the high standard of AKUBRA Hats. Incidentally,
it has never had a strike.
The felt-hat industry is of unquestionable value
to the Commonwealth. If it hadn’t been for the
Akubra people, and others like them, there would
have been a hat famine in Australia during the war,
and people buying hats would have had to pay two or
three times as much as they actually did. While the
struggle was raging, and since, the manufacturers of
Akubra Hats helped to stabilise prices, thus giving the
Australian public a square deal.
If the industry is tided over a critical period there
is no reason why Australian-made hats should not be

AKUBRA HAT FACTORY, BOTJRKE STREET, SYDNEY.
a double block and subjected to the action of steam
blown through a perforated iron plate. The agencies
of manufacture—heat, moisture, pressure, rubbing
and turning—are the same as in the case of fur hats,
but they are somewhat differently applied.
Such are the processes by which AKUBRA Hats
are evolved. And there is nothing better in the way
of headgear than AKUBRA Hats. They are to
be bought in all shades and sizes at prices within
the reach of all. Every hatter who knows his business
stocks them—if YOUR hatter doesn’t, it is a sign that
he doesn’t know his business.
AKUBRA Hats are faithfully made and elegantly
finished. They are manufactured of first-class
Australian materials in a first-class Australian
factory, in which every attention is paid to hygiene,
comfort and contentment, by first-class Australian
workmen. Such of the employees (there are 175
altogether) as are not Australians by birth are
Australians by adoption. They work under an award
of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but the
exported in large quantities to countries like China,
India and South Africa.
But the fair prospect of an export trade cannot even be considered
at present. The fact is that the manufacturers are encountering an
increasingly formidable menace in their own home market.
In the last pre-war year 5 7,239 dozen of fur-felt hats were imported
from foreign countries, the value being £180,982. Italy supplied 1 7,454
dozen valued at £55,467; and the Mother State’s purchases abroad were
28,915 dozen, valued at £92,85 3.
Imports of foreign felt hats practically ceased during the war, but
in 1922 they suddenly rose to 25,076 dozen, declared at £215,096. Italy
was responsible for 9889 dozen; value, £69,280.
This would not be so alarming if there had not been a steady increase
month by month. In the first quarter of the year 3720 dozen came in;
in the second quarter, 5 768 dozen; between July 1 and September 30,
6809 dozen; between October 1 and December 31, 8781 dozen.
The competition of high-grade British goods is not objected to. But
if the market is to be flooded with the produce of low-wage countries
with depreciated currencies the Australian manufacturer will be obliged
to work half-time or shut down altogether.
By the capital and labor of those engaged in the making of felt hats
an eminently useful industry has been won for this Commonwealth. Is it
too much to ask that jt shall be preserved?
You can help to preserve it by seeing that the AKUBRA brand is
on every hat you buy.
Our legislators can help to preserve it by adequately protecting the
Australian manufacturer and worker against the competition of cheap-
labor countries whose money, measured by the pound sterling, is worth
only a fraction of its pre-war value.

The A.J.C. slipped a May meeting into its
calendar last Saturday, and so surprised its
lady friends thereby that they had
scarcely a new rag to present to the stands,
official or otherwise. With a roguish grin
the May day turned on a Spring-like smile
that made even the newest and handsomest
fur a thing to be abhorred, and the tailor-
built a trial to the flesh. Velvet and step-
sister Corduroy seem the popular materials
for the ankle-length clinging frock; and the
short-vamp sandal-shoe, strap or elastic side,
is the footwear of the moment. The meet-
ing didn’t make a wide appeal to Woman, but
the persistent punters, of course, turned up.
Among these was good-looking Mrs. Clayton
enveloped in a navy cloak, and the Mac-
Cormick lady, who had an intriguing black
and white feather in a wide-brimmed near-
beaver. Eugenie Moreau wore her arched
eyebrows surmounted by a cosy black velvet
hat, and was otherwise smart blue tailorings.
Eugenie goes off on her travels again next
week ; as does K.C. Broomfield’s pretty wife.
Dorothea Collins was still another who gave
the glad eye to Randwick for the last time
for many months. Mrs. Lachlan Beaton
and Ruby Adams sweltered under handsome
fur capes. Guy Belisario’s wife contrasted
navy and nigger brown with her blondness,
and Dr. Constance D’Arcy encompassed the
gathering with her enveloping smile.
The ceremony of unveiling the portraits of
Professor David, Professor Wilson and Regis-
trar Barff was one of the biggest events of
Uni. Commem. week. John Longstatf is re-
sponsible for the impressive David and Barff
presentations, and William Nicholson’s brush
has faithfully depicted the high-domed sensi-
tive austerity of Prof. Wilson. These gentle-
men now add to the delights of the Great
Hall, after meeting with an ovation from
the members of the University societies and
the undergrads, on whom their canvas beauty
burst during the chief academic ceremony
of the year.
There’s to be a revival of the pre-war
Military and Naval Ball on this very night
(Thursday) at the Town Hall. The almost-
forgotten glory of army gold and the blue
and bullion of the Navy will help in the
revelry. The colors of the N.S.W. batta-
lions will be “massed” on the platform and
guarded by an escort from the Ist Battery
R.A.F.A. and the Citizens’ Forces. Field
guns, battle honors, anchors, lifebuoys and
other ironmongery will decorate the land-
scape, and over all, with true De Yere
hauteur, will droop Admiral Halsey’s flag
which flew on the Australia on the day the
German fleet sent out the “Kamerad” signal.
The Women Painters pulled off their
smocks and hung their palettes on the hall-
rack one afternoon last week, and gambolled
joyously among admiring friends in an aro-
matic atmosphere of tea and hot buttered
crumpets. The gallery of the Education De-
partment was crowded by art-lovers in smart
hats and Kolinsky and Woy Woy fox ; and so
on. President Ethel Stephens’s zinnias
and Hetty Dymock’s flower-studies called
foffh a general purr of admiration, but Theo
Cowan’s “Surfing Girl” was belle of 'the
party. Music and soiifc were sprayed over
the gathering by Mosman-girl Lily Laing and
a quartette of other gifted fair.
The lot of £ Governor’s wife, if it isn’t all
happy, yet has a few compensations. On
Friday Dame Margaret opened an exhibition
of Australian and English bookplates at Tyr-
rell’s new rooms in Elizabeth-street, and
was rewarded with a charming book-plate of
picturesque Government House by artist
Warner. Sir Walter’s lady was genuinely
surprised, and blushed rosily with pleasure
over her high grey astrakhan collar, though
Miss Henderson had rather the air of saying
“Quite pretty, but shall we catch that train
to Sutton Forest?”
The walls were hung with plates, old and
new. Among the moderns those of Sydney
Ure Smith, Adrian Feint and Lionel Lind-
say were notable. Captain Cook stamped his
books with a globe surrounded by something
that looks like a doctor s prescription, and
means “To be taken in water” or there-
abouts. Owen Cox brands his with a mili-
tant-looking beast; but the legal mind mostly
runs to armorial bearings. Comedian W. S.
Percy has one or two artistic plates of his
own designing: when this versatile mite was
with the Pollards in Maoriland, he designed
most of the posters and the back cloths.
A visitor from the Far North —almost the
Farthest North—dropped into Sydney last
week. He is Charles Kept, poet, novelist
and critic, of Norway. The name comes from
an English forebear, who decided on Norway
as his home address a hundred-odd years ago.
Mr. Kent is one of the members of the Board
of Judges who decide which writer’s work is
worthy of the prize-money awarded every
year by the Government of his country. The
awards run into some thousands of kronen;
and the seven committee-men who make the
choice are voted to their place of power by
the writers of the country. Among them are
two women. One Siegrid Undset, has
made £12,006 in three years out of her
three-volume historical novel, which is now
being translated into English. The book sold
at our equivalent of £1 10s. It is in its 27th
thousand, and with the exception of a few
thousand sold in Denmark and Sweden, Nor-
way bought the lot. They have long evenings
in Norway.
Mrs. Jula Stansfield, a South African
journalist, is giving the glad eye to Sydney.
She hails from Jo’burg, where for years she
has used her pen on the Daily Rand and
the Sunday Times —the latter paper she
helped to found. Rhodesia and Nyassaland
she loves. She declares the Rhodesian men
are just as dear things as novelists Cynthia
Stockley and Gertrude Page claim. Their
attire is climatic if not aesthetic —a soft
shirt, belted into a pair of shorts, an enor-
mous double-brimmed felt hat or a helmet,
socks that end at the ankle and heavy shoes.
“By their legs ye shall know them,” declares
Mrs. Stansfield ; the wide-brimmed hat keeps
the face in shadow.
Moses Baritz, the remarkable Hebrew who,
while in Sydney, mixed musical criticism
with political propaganda of the Reddest hue,
seemed to be wedded to those two wives; but
lie met another Fate lately—in petticoats this
one—and has settled down in musical Man-
chester. Or, at any rate, has settled down
as much as any man can whose lectures,
mainly on opera, in the interests of gramo-
phone-makers, take him all over Britain.
Arbitration Judge Beeby is a playwright,
too. The other Sunday a three-act comedy
of his was read at the Lyster Ormsby’s Circle
at Bellevue Hill. The plot revolves around
a prize play, and even such an up-to-date
figure as Mr. Hickson is among its charac-
ters.
George Lambert, A.R.A., will play a new 7
role on May 24, when he will open an exhi-
bition of water-colors and fans by Thea Proc-
tor at the New Art Salon, in George-street
—it’s nearly opposite the Bulletin office.
Among her colorful compositions there will
be portraits of Mrs. Ernest Watt and Miss
Hera Roberts (the artist’s cousin) in the
dresses in which they appeared at the
Artists’ Ball last year. Potts Point will no
doubt be well represented at the at-home on
the afternoon of May 28, when Mr. and Mrs.
Heysen will be among the guests.
Herewith May Moore’s brand-new picture
of Emily Marks, who has just returned after
eight years in England and America, bring-
ing back with her the sparkling soprano that
Sydney knew, plus an extra curl or two that
study abroad has marcelled into it. Emily
was a pupil of
this city’s one-
time teacher
D’Orson. He
was an un-
assuming man
of many parts,
and trained
his pupil in
lieder, as well
as giving her
lessons in
French and
Italian. I n
London Emily
studied with
Minna Fischer,
and later with
Emil Sauret,
one of Car-
reiio’s several
husbands. Her
last big job
was broad-
casting, which
she did in New York to illustrate the lec-
tures on voice production of Henri Zay.
The voice unleashes itself for the first time
since its return in the King’s Hall on the
81st. Incidentally, the dark, piquaint little
lady is a sister of Australia’s opal expert,
Percy Marks.
Florence Fourdrinier is again striding
along the war-path. She has hearkened to
the cry of Miss Chandler, who directs the
Public Schools’ Domestic Science classes,
for more kitchens, and she is setting out to
attach a kitchen to every public school in
N. S. Wales. She has formed the first branch
of the Co-operative Home-makers’ Associa-
tion, and its objective is to hold an Econo-
mic Home Industries’ and Labor-saving
Domestic Work Exhibition at Manly in
November, the box-office receipts to be de-
voted to establishing at the Manly Public
School a domestic-science kitchen. The
Mayoress of Manly is president and Dr.
Ethel Sands the secretary.
An old-time western belle, Mrs. Catherine
A. Donnelly, died at Waratah recently. As
“Sweet Kitty Cummings” she was a toast
in the spacious days of the Turon. Her
father, William Cummings, of Mt. Conquer,
Bathurst, was a member of the State’s first
Parliament and represented East Macquarie
from 1859 till 1874. Her late husband, S. A.
Donnelly, sat for the Western Goldfields
(1864-66) and then entered the Public Ser-
vice, and the husband of her sister Eleanor,
D. C. J. Donnelly, kept up the political tradi-
tion by representing Carcoar-Cowra, 1891-96.
Passed on recently, at Blaxland, philan-
thropic Mrs. Hargrave, wife of the Rev.
Joshua Hargrave, long in the C. of E. min-
istry. Almost as soon as the old Ragged
Schools were established in Sydney Mrs.
Hargrave identified herself with them, being
an honorary teacher at the first school in
Sussex-street as far back as 1867. At Parra-
matta in 1575, and afterwards at Shoal-
haven, in Surry Hills for 20 years and in
Waterloo the energetic lady unfiaggingly
attended to the wants of the sick, suffering
and poor.
The carpet of the Australia’s drawing-room
stood the tramp of yet another army of tea-
bibbers the other afternoon, when Lee White
and Clay Smith extended the glad hand to a
hundred-odd guests —wives with the.r own or
other wives’ husbands, and husbands with
their own or other men’s girls. The bigger
half of the popular combination dressed her-
self in sapphire-blue georgette that was steel-
engraved in beads. A turban that wedded
Egypt and India in its diminutive architec-
ture hid the blue-black hair. The newly re-
turned Sheldon lady was an early arrival,
and the Braddon and Richards titles were
also among the best millinery. Clever Billie
Lockwood put a glow into the afternoon, and
Eileen O’Brien, from Perth, added a blonde
note to the gathering.
The old boys of St. Ignatius have decided
that their annual reunion shall happen this
year in the Paddington Town Hall on
June 12.
Good-looking Tien Hogue is bringing her
naval husband to Sydney in September, when
the boronia blows.
Gwen Nelson is steadily climbing the
theatrical ladder in New York. Her latest
engagement is that of special-number dancer
in the George B. Cohan production, “The
Rise of Itosie O’Grady.” Gwen’s first speech
with Cohan was on the telephone. He said :
“If you dance as well as you speak, I’d like
to meet you”—and thereupon made an ap-
pointment for Gwen’s “tryout.” “You’ll do,”
he said, half-way through the first, dance. “I
might have known you would. You come
frojn Australia.”
Cohan is an Irishman, and nothing offends
him more than for people to think the spell-
ing of the name is changed from Cohen.
Incidentally, the latest gag in New York
is: “If you want to find a drink, ask a police-
man.”
Hilda Aiken, the Sydney singer and pian-
ist who went to America 10 years ago with
Eva Mylott, is taking a spell to glimpse again
her native land and parents —dad managed
Aarons’s Exchange for long years in the past.
Miss Aiken cut up her 10 years’ absence be-
tween touring with the New ¥ork Metropolitan
Opera Co. and coaching millionaires’ daugh-
ters at the famous Merrill School. Her last
office was the chaperoning of a number of
those poor poverty-stricken girls through
lands where flying-machines were available
for their transport—chiefly Britain, France,
Switzerland and Germany.
Before the Sistine Soloists finally pack
their bags for Rome they will give two more
concerts in Sydney. The first, by the cour-
tesy of the Carrolls, will be a matinee per-
formance on June 2 to help the Convent of
St. Vincent’s in its work of preparing nurs-
ing sisters' for their life’s job. The last
will be on the 4tli at the Conservator-
ium. Maoriland demanded two tours of these
soloists, and wiped its eye with its sporran
when it was refused a third.
An Anglican vicar has succeeded in per-
suading the late Prime Minister to read the
lessons in his church. The announcement
was made last Sunday. No doubt it w’ill
attract a few inquisitive spectators. So, for
that matter, would a cock-fight.
In an exhilarating cover, a Sydney
philanthropist, by name Coghlan, has
gathered together a bunch of recipes
for cocktails. So highly charged with
spirits are they that the very reading
of them fills the atmosphere with stars. For
10 pages Manhattans and Martinis stagger
cheerily along: then they meet a Prohibi-
tion wall of fruit syrups and soft drinks.
After that the book continues on its way
exploring Bright Eyes and Starboard Lights.
When the intoxicated reader feels he ean
stand no more without bursting into speech,
there are seven pages of toasts for him.
R. M. Pontey is a natural fighter who ran
a little war of his own during the somewhat
larger one. He collected vegetables and fruit
for soldiers’ dependants, which angered the
big official bodies that were also doing such
work. They declared him bogus, and used
bell, book and candle* on him; but Pontey
went on as though he was deaf and couldn’t
read handwriting, and as many of the schools
supported him he gathered and dispensed
large quantities of the fruits of the earth.
He has now gqne to America and England
with one of those inventions which make
people’s fortunes —sometimes. Many a Mrs.
and Widow Bill will hope that this is one of
the times.
Manly is proud of a centenarian, too, for
Mrs. Smythe, who lives in Pittwater-road,
passed her 100th milestone recently. Over
half-a-century ago she settled in Auckland,
having arrived there in the Rangitira, which
her husband commanded ; but shortly after-
wards she came to Sydney. The husband
died on one of his voyages to China.
Muriel Starr’s return to the Sydney stage
will be hailed with delight by those who have
an ear for a charming speaking voice. There
is a rich, rounded note in her speech that
redeems the most inane of lines. If she plays
Daisy in “East of Suez,” as they hint, she
will have a glittering chance for cadences
and nuances in Daisy’s description of the
effect of the poppy on the opium smoker.
Herewith Mrs. E. W. Fenner, who was for
many years one of the best known of Fijian
hostesses. Her husband was general man-
ager of the Nausori mills for the C.S.R., and
her grand-
father was
Canon Kem-
mi s, of St.
Mark’s. In
her commerce
and church
mixed wit h
the happiest
results, for it
is said that
more islaiul
romances
bloomed t o
orange blos-
soms through
Mrs. Fenner’s
parties than at
any other hos-
tess’s. Since
her return to
Sydney her pet
charity has
been Prince
Alfred Ilospi
tal, and one of the most successful dinner-
dances of the week was given at the Went-
forth in aid of that big institution under the
capable lady’s secretaryship.
Miss B. M. Partridge (the Sister Liguori
of Sydney’s last “Escaped Nun” drama)
made a reappearance at the Hickson Mission
in Sydney. Her rSle was that of attendant
to a blind old lady who was giving spiritual
healing a trial. Ex-Sister Liguori, who still
lives with the Touehells at Kogarah, carried
with her, presumably as a token of her eman-
cipation, a Bible presented to her by the
Katoomba Presbyterian Sunday-school.
The Sydney Day Nursery Association is
winding up the Chain Teas organised to help
its treasury, and the committee is anxious to
have all funds in as soon as possible.
Treasurer Dulcie Fry lies in wait at London
Bank Chambers.
A Brisbane postscript:—
His Ex. returned from the North on the 17th, with
a better comprehension of that great, rich, mostl.v-
empty possession, and some wise things to say about
tilling it with white folk.
Archbishop Sharp, who has just come back from
the South, declares that people in Sydney are more
prayerful than in Brisbane—a testimonial that will
doubtless bring a surprised blush to the cheek of
the Harbor village. Meantime naughty Brisbane
has had its General Assembly, and minister Mervyn
Henderson, head of Emanuel College, entertained
some of the visitors to tennis, tea and music by
Halley Scarlett. Moderator Martin smiled ecclesi-
astically upon the throng.
The Brisbane Amateur Turf Club had its opening
flutter on the same day, under blue skies, at Albion
Park. Mrs. J. L. Woolcock, the Glyn-Connollys and
Cecily Cadoll-Gfcarrick—who used to dance with
Prince Teddy—were among the onlookers.
Steele Rudd’s new magazine burst into bloom the
other day, flaunting petals from several Bulletin
contributors, including Francis Kenna, Ed Dyson, M.
Forrest and Harry J.ulius.
As a set-off to the mixed fearsomes, Hamilton
golf clubhouse dressed itself in brown and gold of
chrysanthemum design, blew itself out with music,
and spread a dinner and dance for its members an
evening or two ago. The eaters and whirlers in-
cluded the Hoopers, Erie Elliots, P. J. Symeses and
Beits.
Officers and cadets of the Woodarra borrowed the
Hillcoats’ house and hung it with a coat of mam-
colors for their dance, which was a lively, colorful
affair, well supplied with music by the Mayfield
orchestra and the Woodarra’s band.
Architect Claude Chambers’s wife died after a
short illness on the 15th. She had lived at Cre-
morne, Sydney, for some time, and had only recently
brought her sunshine here.
The Harbor Lights guild went in for extra lights
and gathered blossoms to decorate St. Mary’s Hall
for a dance the. other night. Scott-Ross and his
spouse graced the function, and Doris Waraker, Grizel
Gibson, Dr. Pattison and the Woodarra men were
among those who jazzed to the time of Toppin s band.
All ball arrangements were declared null and void
by the committee of the Warwick picnic races this
week, on account of the death of Charlie Macdougall,
who founded the club nearly 30 years ago. All the
amateur jockeys wore crepe in memory of a good
sport.

Social Melbourne was thrilled to its mar-
row by the astounding news of Lady Pleas-
ance Rous’s quick marriage with young
Owen McKenna, “sparks” on a IJ.1 J . and O.
boat, and the son of “working folk.” Uppali
Toorakians nodded wisely. They were not
astonished—not they. When the eldest vice-
regal daughter landed here early last year
with her younger sister Charlotte —known to
the irreverent as “Charlotte Russe” —Mrs.
Rumor hinted at a shipboard romance shat-
tered by parental disapproval. The suitor,
who was said to be of humble origin, dis-
covered too late that the damsel, who was
travelling incog., called a belted Earl
father. Lady Pleasance steamed off to
Rangoon a few months back, and now Too-
rakia wonders if her bridegroom is that
same young gent. Mrs. Rumor talked about
before. The bride has not only changed her
name and estate, but also her religion. The
vice-regal Countess is reported to have said
“Bless you, my children,” and sent along two
rows of grandmamma’s pearls attached to a
diamond 'clasp as a wedding gift; also it is
mentioned that the bride ran up her own
pink georgette wedding chilfonery. Lady
Pleasance, who was seldom seen in the social
whirl during her stay at vice-regal Stoning-
ton, is a colorless likeness of her vivid
mother. The latter was inclined to snap
her slender fingers at social distinctions, more
especially when discoursing on the matter of
Girl Guiding, and she may find it easier to
accept her son-in-law than her more con-
servative husband does.
The Stradbrokes are going to do their
duty by their second daughter, Helena, who
is to be presented at Court before plunging
into the whirl of a London season, and they
have hired a Mayfair house for some weeks.
The youngest little Rouseabout, Charlotte, is
tucked away with her brothers at the Mace-
don place. Everyone is wondering if the
Jazzing Countess will still ):e inclined to
side-track the social commandments when
she gets back, and be as keen an advocate of
the Girls’ Guide intimacies between young
people belonging to violently differing grades
of society. She was wont to stymie anxious
mothers who hinted at noss.ble entangle-
ments betweom Toorak and Collingwood with
the half-laughing declaration, “My daughters
did it.”
New fads are washing out the jazz craze.
On Friday afternoon the English-speaking
Union toy served as a peg for a smart tea-
party hostessed by Mrs. Norman Brookes
at her South Yarra place. A lady doctor,
Ffloyd Williams, spoke on the question of
a united front for the English-speaking races,
which had nothing whatever to do with cor-
sets. Arthur Robinson volleyed oratorical
enthusiasm, Prof. Osborne scolded us for
not making more fuss about Uncle Sam’s
sons and daughters, and after other passion-
ate remarks from speakers of lesser tonnage
the company, which was heavily leavened
with Toorak, fed on cream-puffs, and won-;
dered idly what it was all about. One young
thing got the wild idea that the introduc-
tion of the American idiom and accent was
being weighed in the balance.
The Prince of Wales will be 29 next
month, and still there is no sign of an ap :
proaching marriage. Most of the girls
spoken of a few years back as possible brides
have either married or become engaged to
less exalted men. Yolande of Italy, much
discussed as a prospective consort during
the war, chose a commoner: in any case, her
religion would have been a stumbling-block.
Lady Mary Cambridge, a cousin of the
Prince and a favorite niece of the Queen, is
to marry the Marquis of Worcester, the Duke
of Beaufort’s only son. And now Lady
Rachel Cavendish is out of the running,
being engaged to a humble third son. On
the Prince’s return from Ind : a, the society
papers were always coupling his name with
Lady Rachel’s and exhibiting their photos
side'by side. But the Prince remains single.
The war having prevented his being caught
young, he seems determined not to be caught
at all. He has proved himself a young man
with a mind of his own. He may be original
enough to be a bachelor King of England.
It is not a kid-gloved crowd which threat-
ens to make the Orchestral League concerts
a paying proposition, but the real music-
lovers who go because they like it. Among
this lot on Saturday afternoon were the
James Barrett pair; the Edward Miller
dame, stately and alone; little Mrs. Crivelli
and a son; Miss Ilebden and a niece; two
Godfrey sisters; the Garran lady; a con-
stellation of ’Varsity lights (including Prof.
Masson’s wife, who convoyed Mrs. Gilruth),
and, of course, the Albert Miller widow, who
knows more about mus.c than most. Gibson
Young, as organiser of the League, voiced
its thanks for the thickly-populated houses,
and while he was doing it the freakish
acoustics of the Town Hall gave back every
word with lightning-like rapidity, so the
aud.ence were treated to a sort of uneven
duet.
The spectacular note was sounded loudly
when Lorna Sargood and Keith Uebenham
exchanged vows at St. John’s before a
crowded house the other day. The bride sug-
gested Joan of Arc armored in silver, with
a breastplate of burnished embroideries and
a backwash of silver»sheeting. Pearls girdled
her waist, and more pearls flirted with more
silver round the edging of her silk net veil,
which flowed from a diadem of orange flow-
ers dished up on silver. A trio of brides-
maids, Madge Currie, Kathleen Grey Smith
and Yvonne Grant, followed in ivory velvet
skirts, hooped at the hip and scalloped with
silver at the hem, under straight-jacket
bod.ces, decorated with silver poppies. Yards
of wine-colored veiling were anchored to their
mainmasts by green leaves, and they carried
red roses hedged in with leaves. Alan Syme
had the help of Russell Manton and Jim Sar-
good in looking after the bridegroom. The
A. 11. Sargocds spread the wedding feast for
400 in the usual pink-lined tent on the lawn
of Egoleen, their Toorak place. Mrs. Sar-
good did tlie honors in black satin gladdened
with touches of gold and petunia to match
tlie wreathings on her black hat. Mrs. Deb-
enham was attractively marocained in brown
with beaded trimming effects and a dash of
fur on her hat. The bride’s grandmother,
Mrs. Younge, looked as if she had stepppd
out of a picture: she was in black georgette
with an ostrich hat-feather backing her sil-
ver locks. George Aitken, Dalgety’s Vic-
torian head, who was there with his good-
looking wife, was chief speech-maker, and
General Grimwade, who toasted the bride’s
parents, was getting his tongue in for the
paternal oration at daughter Gwenda’s wed-
ding, which comes off a few days hence.
ARGUS-editor Cunningham brought up the
oratorical rear with a few verbal posies for
the Debenham parents.
Australia is to be visited shortly by a lady
who is travelling in the interest of the Zion-
ist movement, and her persuasive oratory is
expected to loosen the purse strings of the
Chosen. Madame Pevsner, this very talented
Jewess, has lately been calling upon the
communities in China and Japan. In Austra-
lia the Jews have taken little interest in the
Zionist cause, although when Israel Cohen
visited the country on a missionary expe-
dition there was a Brief wave of enthusiasm
and a large amount of money was prom-
ised. It is darkly hinted that there are
still lots of those promises waiting for
Madame Pevsner or someone to convert into
cash.
Ellie Lamperd, here pictured by Monteath,
is beginning to get notice as composer.

Sh e i s a
Queenscliff
girl, and
graduated at
the ’Varsity
Con. in 1916.
The late D. J.
Cou 11 s and
P r of. Laver
were her prin-
cipal pilots in
piano study;
Dr. Price made
available the
secrets of harmony and counterpoint; and
she fiddled for a while under the watchful eye
of Alberto Zelman. The piano, however,
is her instrument, and Ooutts liked to have
her at a keyboard to illustrate his lecture
recitals. A few weeks back she toured the
Speck as solo p'anist and accompanist with
a concert co., and gathered by the wayside a
fine posy of press notices.
There have been few more tragic endings
on the Australasian stage than the accident
which befell bright-faced Phyllis Porter, at
Wellington (M.L.) recently. Her part was
in the ballet in “The Peep Show.” and in
a dancing turn the metal on the tinsel
flicked against the terminals on the electric
switchboard, and a short circuit set fire to
her flimsy covering. Then she did a fine
thing: instead of rushing her blazing drap-
eries among the other filmy-clad girls, she
ran away from them. After much suffering
she passed away, always asking with con-
cern about the other girls. Phyllis first ap-
peared in a J.C.W. panto., and was only 19
when her eyes closed.
Everard Browne, who has suffered for
years from the effects of a driving accident,
has now been ordered a sea-voyage tonic.
His wife is preparing to go with him, but
at present she is having a rather anxious
time over daughter Bettine, an attractive
young thing who recently divorced her appen-
dix.
Doris Veale, who came from her native
Fog to marry Riverina squatter Ernest
Officer, was handed over by h j r naval-lieut.-
brother at All Saints’ last week. She was in
shimmery white hangings, with a floating
back curtain of white satin that sported
golden embroideries. Posies of orange-
blossom clasped the tulle br.dal veil on her
pretty head, and a bunch of pink roses
blushed against the snowy background.
Cousin Harry Officer helped the ’groom
through, while Priscilla Weigall—Dr.
Gerald Weigall's flapper daughter—’maided
the bride picturesquely in primrose silk under
a flower-wreathed straw hat. The cake,
which had voyaged with the bride and her
brother, was cut at Hertford, the East St.
Hilda homestead of the bridegroom’s sister.
Only near relatives had been bidden to the
feast, the family being in mourning.
Behold Biddy, the youngest of Prof.
S’Harry Allen’s trio of daughters! They
are a brainy
three. Edith is
skipping down
the Inky Way;
Ma r y is a
gifted painter;
little Biddy is
facing a musi-
cal future as
one of Goll’s
prize pupils.
She is to have
a recital some-
where round
the corner of
the future, and
meantime the
popular girleen
lives in a per-
petual whirl of
a c t i v i t ie s,
musical an d
otherwise. One
of her most
strenuous ex-
ereises is done in the Red Cross
Tea Room at the Melbourne Hospital,
where she is in charge certain days each
week. For many months she busied her-
self as understudy to one of the Vic. League
secs., who was tripping abroad, and, further,
she gives mother a hand with her numerous
philanthropic undertakings. Rembrandt
made the photo.
The Fisken family is again in mourning,
sister Lily having followed her late brother
Archie over the hill. During the war she
and her sister Alice were 0.8.E.’d for their
work in England, and after their return to
Australia they “carried on” among the free
kindergarten kiddies.
Alec Russell, son and heir of the Western
District Philip Russells, will temporarily for-
sake his woolly activities to accompany his
pal Stanley Bruce to the Empire Conference.
He goes as private secretary. With his social
tone and Sackville-street tailorings he should
make a howling success of the job of helping
the Priminister keep his social end up when
the invitation pasteboards rattle in. The
social faux pas credited to Billy Hughes
won’t be repeated by his successor. Russell,
who served in the war in English khaki, is
an old Geelong Grammarian. His wife—
Fred Fairbairn’s handsome elder daughter-
will go as unofficial lady-in-\yaiting to Mrs.
Bruce.
Cynthia Taylor, who has just closed her
school days at St. Catherine’s, Toorak, where
she starred on the comedy side in school
theatricals, has decided to give the profes-
sional footlights a trial, and is now in the
final rehearsals of “Tangerine.” Cynthia’s
father, who passed out some years back, was
one of the “Overnewton” Taylors; and her
mother, the youngest of the William Temple-
ton widow’s vast family, took a second
matrimonial plunge a couple of years ago
with the medical McAdams’ son and heir.
Mrs. Templeton, who long since passed her
80th milestone, is an aunt of the legal knight
Edward Mitchell, and a cousin of the Argus
Mackinnons.
One of Melbourne’s young bucks ■was
tickled the other day by a letter from his
pa-in-law-that-might-have-been, asking h’m
as a special favor not. to travel in the ship
for which he had booked his passage. The
writer explained that his only daughter, who
was shortly to be married, would be honey-
mooning in the same vessel, and as the blue-
eyed damsel had turned the young mnn down
for the actual bridegroom-to-be, dad would
much rather the rejected swain chose
another route. Mutual friends are now
eagerly awaiting the result of the pathetic
appeal.
Bridge raged all over the Bertie Austins’
Toorak parlors the other afternoon and even-
ing to bag a few pounds to help-the finances
of the Victoria League. This body, among
other things, keeps the bush cocky in books
and magazines. A group of girl brigands
raked in further funds by vending lollies and
flowers, while another gang profiteered with
the teacups. A Ted Mitchell daughter, Mrs.
George Adams and the Rupert Greene mat-
ron were in charge of the pekoe pots. Mrs.
Austin had combined with the
widow, Miss Guthrie and the John Grices’
elder daughter to engineer the affair, and
quite the right cnnvd included the Donald
Mackinnon matron and daughter Marie and
Chief Justice Irvine’s younger chick, Nancy.
Good-looking Marjorie Bloch, who is that
rare thing, a blonde Jewess, has just en-
gaged herself to Oswald D. Benjamin, young-
est of the handsome Benjamin Benjamin
' -mily. Dad Benjamin was in his time
Mayor of Melbourne and a prominent city
figure. Pa Bloch, a Belgian, was also work-
ing towards the foreground in moneyed
society a while back, lie built a mansion-
house in the exclusive portion of Toorak-
road; but in the post-war slump the place
was sold, and the family retired to a flat
at Cloyne, the one-time home of the judicial
Maddens.
There is now hope for the Argus. General-
manager Holtz has not only developed a
sense of humor but admitted that his
journal is not infallible. He has cited some
samples of errors that had caused pain and
provoked smiles at the same time. A comp,
changed “Wanted strong boy, about 15 years
old, to open oysters,” into “Wanted strong
boy to open oysters about 15 years old.”
"Lame Nellie Melba” also managed to elude
the hundred eyes, and tickle readers. _ Had
Holtz turned to his local contemporaries he
could have got such striking instances as
“looking through a widow” at the thunder-
storm, and “Lady l’leasance Lous.” Our
Earl will find it hard to forgive that L for
an R in his family name.
The Jim Fairbairns (she was Peggy For-
rester) are having rather an unromantic ter-
mination to their Honolulu honeymoon. They
and other passengers by the Makura have been
given 21 days’ C.B. at Sydney Quarantine
Station because they travelled with two small-
pox patients.
Note from the Father of Fifteen:—
Football clubs might with advantage adopt the
theatrical rule refusing admission to children in arms.
At the Fitzroy v. South match I counted 17 babies
under two years. When South kicked a sixer one
proud father waved his tiny offspring aloft flagwise;
and I don’t believe that sort of thing is much good
to any infant. ,
Associated as he is with 15 organisations
of one kind and another, W. A. Callaway,
who used to be permanent head of the Chief
Sec.’s Department, manages to march to-
wards his seventies without feeling old or
dull. The other day he told a story against
himself. When Under-Sec. he was going
out to lunch one day at 12.55 p.m. It was
all right for him as boss to go out five
minutes early, but when he met a junior
clerk who was doing likewise he called
attention to the time. “It’s all right,” was
the audacious youngster’s reply, “I won’t
mention anything about it, Mr. Callaway.”
Temple Court, with all its memories of
legal celebrities, is to be demolished to make
room for a 12-storeyed modern structure. T. J.
Noske, the new owner, must have made
pretty sure of outbidding all competi-
tors, because the Grainger firm of architects
already lias the design for the new sky-
scraper prepared for him. It looks as if
Collins House will have to hide its diminshed
head when the new Temple Court'is finished.
The vendors of the property were the trus-
tees of the late George Hurst, a Methody par-
son of the early days.
A line or two from Adelaide
Herbert Phillipps, who has been Consul for Bel-
gium for dog’s ages, has resigned the job and
handed over his insignia of office, whatever they
may be, to W. Fowler Brownsworth, M.C.
Dorothy Cowell, with Brewster Jones (piano) and
Bertha Jones (violin) to help her, gave a Bach-
Debussy recital at the Willard Hall the other even-
ing, and won high marks. She and Brewster Jones
between them played “En Blanc et Noir,” one of the
last things Debussy composed and never previously
performed in this village.
The Cup meeting brought a big contingent of
the squattocraey to town, including the Keith Bow-
mans and their just-out daughter, Mrs. Keith
Brougham, the Walter Smiths from Yalumba, Ne-
man Brookmans, Ronald Angases and Eric Murrays.
The Society of Arts Winter Show has been opened,
with Lady Bridges to give her benediction, Presi-
dent Edward Davies to introduce her, and John
White to thank her for coming. Gwen Barringer
and W. A. F. Seppelt are two of the star exhibitors,
and Beulah Leicester has some attractive china
painting and enamel brooches.
The Repertory Theatre opened its 1923 season
with “Major Barbara,” and scored such heavy book-
ings that the show had to be repeated. Incidentally,
Ethelwyn Robin was shown at her best as Lady
Britomarte, and Beryl Kook as a delightful Ladv
Barbara. Miss Ernest Good, Miss Judge and small
daughter Alvida were with his Ex. and Lady Bridges
in the audience.
Four of the younger set—Barbara Howard, her
brother, Nan Mitchell and Alec Paterson —joined
forces to stage a dance at the Osborne Hall the
other night. Both the hostesses were in black —
Miss Howard in satin with jetted Russian net, and
Miss Mitchell in jetted tulle. The only debutante
of the evening (the L. C. Moorhouses’ daughter!
was all agleam in white, silver and crystal.

The A.J.C. opened its winter season at
Randwick on Saturday, and the Toohey-Booth com-
bination was again strongly in evidence. Toohey’s
first mount, MontOro, which won at 7’s, had not
scored for a couple of years. His next success was
on S. Killiek’s stylishly-bred filly Lady Valais,
Valais—Lady Childwick, which went out. favorite
at 4’s for the Nursery. This smart youngster,
which brought 825 guineas as a yearling, had pre-
viously won at Newcastle with ridiculous ease.
Pennybont proved that his Newcastle Cup win was
no fluke by capturing the handicap from King of
the Forest and Punch. He saw the mile and a
half out like a true stayer. Jimmy Munro on the
winner stopped Toohey’s sequence of firsts, but the
latter came again' in the Highweight Handicap,
and won on Miss Lila from Mountaineer with
Munro up. The Hurdle winner, Les Paddington,
created new figures (3min. 40Jsec.) for two miles
at Randwick. Agar, owned by L. It. S. Mackinnon,
chairman of the V.R.C., won the Steeple.
* • * *
The weights for the A.R.C. City Handicap
and Birthday Cup are naturally influenced by the re-
sults of the Goodwood Handicap and the Adelaide Cup.
Denacre, who won the Goodwood with 9st. 31b., goes
up to lOst. 21b. in the City, giving the brilliant St.
Speed half a stone instead of receiving it; but St.
Speed, in spite of his failure then, is considered able
to give about a stone to anything else. King
Ingoda’s win with 9st. 71b. in the Adelaide Cup has
made it difficult to weight him for the Birthday.
He has been given the steadier of lOst. 61b., the
nearest to him being Crusader with §st. 111 b.
Chaparal, second in the Cup, receives the remarkable
concession of 3st. from the winner of it.

S,A. Jockey Club had a big third day on
the tote, and the total for the meeting was £lll,OOO.
The stake-money was practically all kept in the
State. The Chaffeys, from Vic., were the only visi-
tors to win a race, and that was a mere “division”
of a small event. King Ingoda, though' trained in
Vic., is owned by Dubois, a South Aus. landowner,
and Bennett, an Adelaide lawyer.

“0.K.”: “Straight-out” bookies in Vic-
toria are seemingly bent, on putting a stop to the
“concession” stunt, whereby many members of the
fraternity have built up a business at the old straight-
outers’ expense. To me it seems that the real
grievance of the complainants is against certain
licensed “place” bettors, whose starvation odds —far
less, on the average, than one-fourth of the full
odds laid for a win—have driven punters into the
arms of concession layers. Backing a horse at con-
cession price is mere timid playing for safety, a?
every intelligent punter understands. Instead of
accepting reduced odds for a win, with the saving
clause of “money returned” if your fancy gets beaten
into a “shop,” every wise punter would prefer to
back the horse “both ways” when he has confidence
in it, provided he could get the best available odds
from one bookmaker, and a fourth of those odds
from the registered place bettor. But this is what he
has not been able to get. The men with the place
books have killed their trade by offering ridiculously
small odds. It was not good enough, as a rule, for
the punter to double his risk on such, unfair terms.
He simply made one investment at concession rates,
and abandoned the idea of reaping a profit if his
fancy finished second or third. That is to say, he
accepted 4 to 1 concession about Flyblow when the
straight-out men offered 6 to 1, for the reason that
he couldn’t get 6 to 4 for a place from the robbers
who are supposed to offer a fourth of the odds.
They were in such cases limiting their price to evens.
In fact, the concession men thrived on the rapacity
of the 1,2, 3 men who offered nothing like a fair
deal. Presently the coneessionists drew attention to
their own rapacity by barring warm favorites; hence
the appeal to the supreme betting authorities. Book-
makers of the ' old school want concession betting
abolished, and a system of “win and 1,2, 3” estab-
lished in its place ; the place bet to be optional with
the punter, but compulsory on the layer if required
of him. And as this amendment will practically
wipe out most of the gang of robbers who now .ive
by laying an eighth of the market odds for a place,
the sooner it happens the better.
Norths (Premiers) met Balmain at Sydney
Cricket Ground on Saturday, in the presence of a
20,000 crowd. ’Main’s heavy forwards rattled the
Bridgeites’ rearguard at the start. Although well
fed by their imported Bananaland and South Syd-
ney rake, Claude O’Donnell, they couldn't get a
move on, and ’Mains, aided by a stiff nor’-wester, had
totted up 12 points (tries by Mick Russell and D.
Millard, and goals by the former and Georgie Robin-
son) to 5 points (a try by Herman Peters, converted
by Dallas Hodgins) before ends were changed.
Benefiting by some plain talk from Chris McKivatt,
and the breeze, and with Waterhouse replacing Proc-
tor, who had broken an ankle, the champions got
straight to business. Their forwards (Fault and
Farnell especially) delved in like demons, O’Donnell
consistently robbed Harold Watt of the ball, and
Duncan Thompson got his backs hopping in rare
style. Strange to say, North’s star wingers,
Harold Border and Charmer Blinkhorn, hardly got a
smell of the leather. The success of the side was
due to the clever w'ork of Thompson, the straight
running and hard tackling of Herman Peters, Hod-
gins and Rule, and the opportunism of Farnell and
Faull. The issue was in doubt right up to “no
side,” although Norths notched 12 points (tries by
Farnell and Faull, and 3 goals by Hodgins) to the
Dockers’ nil during the closing half. For ’Mains
Chook Frazer, Willie Craig (Jimmie’s young brother),
Junker Robinson and Snowy Latta (the latter mostly
among the backs) did great work. The other games
provided two shocks. Souths piled up 15 points
(3 tries 3 goals) to Easts’ five (1 try 1 goal), and
Glebe outed Wests by 15 points (5 tries) to 7
(1 try 2 goals).
The Vie. Rugby League commenced opera-
tions at Middle Park on Saturday, when preliminary
matches by XIII’s from Melbourne, Air Force and
St. Kilda were decided. Harry Sunderland, presi-
dent of the new body, is optimistic, and he has
a certain amount of cause to be. Six teams have
already been formed, one of them from Melbourne
’Varsity, and arrangements are already being made
to stage the first inter-State game between N.S.W.
and Vic.
* * * #
“Leagueite”: In August next a hundred
years will have elapsed since a boy at Rugby School
—one William Webb Ellis—first scandalised his com-
panions by tucking the ball under his wing and barg-
•mg into his opponents. A tablet at the big school
. commemorates his pioneering exploit. The first
adult team to play the new game was the Black-
heath Club, formed by a number of old
Rugbeians in 1855. It caught on, and in 1871
the English Rugby Union was formed. The first
international game {England v. Scotland) was played
in this year, but the Scottish Rugby Union did not
come into being until 1873. Wales followed in
1880, and the Irish Rugby Union in 1881. The
N.S.W. Rugby Union was formed in 1882.
Herewith J. B.Jaekson, skipper of the 1923
M.L. Universities’ R.U.
XV, now in Sydney.
He is a golden-locked
young giant who plays
a typical Enzed for-
ward game. Jackson re-
presented the combined
M.L. Unis, in 1920-21-
22, and he also wears
the rep. jersey for Can-
terbury Province. At
other times he toils tor
an engineer’s degree at
Canterbury University
College, Christchurch.

There were
spasms of fine Rugger
in the opening match
between Sydney and
M.L. ’Varsities at
Sydney on Saturday,
but. both sides were
guilty of frequent off-
side play and tenth-
rate handling. N.S.W.
had four three-
quarters and packed
the 3-2-3 scrum;
M.L. had three
three-quarters, two
five-eighths, the ob-
solete win g-
forward, and
pushed the 2-3-2
“wedge” serum.
The N.S.W.
method won on
the day. Each
half had its
thrill. In the
first, amid a Dervish charge by the Blues, J. F. Mur-
ray (M.L.’s nippy centre) brilliantly intercepted and
beat the opposition past half-way, and then transferred
to A. N. McDonald (the burly Otago winger), who
galloped over the line. It evened the scores to
8-all at half-time. In the second half N.S.W. ap-
peared well stoushed when G. B. Ilesslein (half-back)
gathered from a horde of Blacks and whipped out to
J. A. Foote (centre three-quarter). Foote sped away,
grubber-kicked, brilliantly gathered again and scored.
Which left honors even—ll all.
* * * *
Melbourne football grows willing. On
Saturday Carlton played most of the second half
against Richmond, with two men short —one had
broken his arm. Nevertheless, the Blues scored 60
points to the Tigers’ 54—their first victory this
season. ’Wood, whose centre line is weak, and who
have not replaced Dick Lee, did poorly against St.
Hilda —48 to Saints’ 69. A brick was heaved at the
umnire, and that harassed official had also to report
a Saints committeeman for accusing him of bias. Yet
Saints were playing at home and never looked like
losing. Essendon downed South by 49 points to
39. and the indications are that the undefeated ’Dons
will crash next Saturday. ’Rov went to Geelong and
lost by 61 to 71. At lemon-time the Maroons were
5 goals to the bad, which so unnerved' them that
they “mixed it,” and a pitched battle threatened.
’Roy is gaining the reputation in this respect that
South used to have.
“Winkle”; When asked recently to allow
substitutes To take the place of injuied men the
Australian Lootball Council declined on the ground
that risk of injury was part of the game. Players,
:£ ey c r , u i ed ’ are to stand must go on to
the held. An instance of the working of this fool-
occurred at Richmond on Saturday. Farrow,
ot Carlton, got concussion. He was given time to
recover a few of his scattered wits, and then hustled
on , to the ground with a coat over his shoulders
and three trainers to supervise him as he wandered aim-
lessly about, Last week Bert Lenne, of St. Ivilda, plaved
on with a broken rib, and rarely a Saturday passes
without an instance or two of this mistaken pluck,
oucn spectacles are so common and the remedy is
so plain that the attitude of the ruling body can
only be ascribed to a conservatism that refuses to
pi ont by the good points of Rugby or any other
rival code. J

, • It is strange that Australian foot-
Dall should be practically dead in Sydney. Its father
was 1. W. Wills, who was horn in N.S.W. in 1835,
and became captain of Rugby School, England. He
settled in Melbourne in 1856, and found football almost
unknown there. Thinking Rugby too rough for the
working classes, he invented a “gentler” game, with
a few simple but elastic rules. (As tripping, hacking
and rabbiting were allowed its gentleness is ques-
tionable.) After a couple of years he handed over
the captaincy of the club he had formed to his
cousin, H. C. A. Harrison (now chairman of the
Australian FootwalL Council). Harrison, born at
Parramatta in 1837, was “the greatest charger and
runner of his day.” For a decade he was the cham-
pion amateur of Australia-—fiat or hurdles—doing
100 in lOsec. and 440 in SOlsec. on grass—wonder-
ful performances then. In 1866 delegates of the
four existing ciubs—Melbourne, Carlton, South Yarra
and Royal Park-—met and adopted definite rules ; and
from that date the game grew rapidly, until in
1875 there were 96 clubs in Melbourne, 42 in the
country, and in four States the game predominated.
During this period matches were played in open
paddocks, and in exciting games the spectators would
so encroach on the field that often the playing space
was only 20yds. wide. Because of this Harrison
battled unsuccessfully for five years with his fellow
members of the Melbourne Cricket Club for permis-
sion to use the enclosed cricket ground. Eventually
a trial match against Carlton, with 6d. admission,
was played, and the £5OO that was taken so im-
pressed cricket executiv.es that their grounds were
always at the service of football clubs thereafter.
* * * *
There were some close battles in the open-
ing of the Melbourne pennant tennis season on Satur-
day. South Yarra, with O’Hara Wood as star, just
scraped home after a heavy engagement with M.C.C.,
who produced Patterson, Wertheim and the two
promising colts Dunlop and Dickenson. Patterson
was much below par, but Wertheim’s clean volleying
saved the situation in both their matches, though Wood
and Lyon ran them to three sets. Wood, who scored
repeatedly with his low, well-placed shots, was the
best on the ground. Down at Geelong Jack Hawkes,
playing with his brother, suffered defeat at the
hands Of another Davis Cupper, Mclnnes, with the
solid and effective Fitts. The ’Varsity pair gained
the verdict in each of their arguments, but as their
colleagues, Browne and Hallows, failed by bigger
margins in their events, the students were nine games
behind in the aggregate. Malvern had an equally
narrow, win oyer Brighton. Malvern’s big pair,
Rainey and Fitchett, who have been twice runners-
up in Vic. doubles championships, got the surprise
of their lives in being knocked out by Priestley and
Foster, who also put up a good fight against Schlesin-
ger and Frankenburg, but went down in the third
set. Curiously enough, Watson and Finlayson, who
were hopelessly outplayed by Rainey and Fitchett,
scored 2 —6, 6—2, 6—2 against Schlesinger and co.
* «• * *
Though Brookes, Anderson and other Austra-
lian players gave unsolicited testimonials to the quality
of the Australian-made tennis ball, the Vic. Lawn
Tennis Association decided by a narrow majority to
use the imported ball at the next November cham-
pionships. The local ball has survived all the tests
that were held necessary to prove the foreign one’s
fitness for a tournament, but one or two influential
persons are said to have commercial reasons for
keeping the overseas bait in play. It is a pity. The
industry involves high technical skill, employs a
lot of people, and only needs an advt. from some
representative body like the L.T.A.V. to develop
vastly.
* *■'■'* »
“15-30”: Patterson is understood to be
playing miserable tennis just now because he is de-
veloping a new backhand stroke. lie is determined
to bring his backhand up to international concert-
pitch, and is gamely suffering defeat in the process.
This is not said in excuse of his recent Sydney wal-
loping by Anderson, who is his unquestionable
superior at present, but it serves to explain his fall-
ing-off in Victoria and Queensland against men who
never will be in his class. Patterson is following
in the footsteps of the late Anthony Wilding, who,
when he found his backhand useless for world-beating
purposes, started a new one, and must have suffered
much anguish of mind through losing to second-raters
while the new shot was growing up. But once
he learnt to backhand with his forehand’s precision
and deadliness, nothing could stop him, and he was
four times champion of the world. If Patterson
produces a backhand of equal quality and maintains
the same blistering pace of his service 'and forehand
drives, he may paralyse all opposition next year. It
has to be remembered that Anderson, though supreme
in most departments of tennis, is still not a first-
class backhand hitter. He has the evil Australian
habit of dodging backhand strife by running round to
take the ball on his forehand, thereby exposing his
weakness to his opponent, and, at the same time,
leaving a hole in his defence big enough for a tram
to run through.
* * * *
“Linesman”: Britain’s selection of Lycett,
Gilbert, Godfree and Mavrogordato for the Davis Cup
has caused a lot of criticism, for none of them, bar
Lycett, is equal to extending any of Australia’s first
four cracks, or the best men in France, Spain or the
U.S. Lycett -was heavily defeated by Patterson in
the final of the Wimbledon Singles last year, and it
can’t be forgotten that he had the easier journey in
the draw, since Anderson, O’Hara Wood, Kingscote,
Norton and the young French champion. Cochet. were
all in Patterson’s half of the battle. “Boy” Norton,
the cherubic little South African, who faced Tilden
in a Wimbledon final a couple of years back, is a
much greater performer than Gilbert, Godfree or
Mavrogordato. and the onlv sensible explanation of
his absence from the English team is that he was
not available. As to the dropping of Kingscote, it
may be also that he would be otherwise engaged, or
possibly he has retired, being now well into the
forties; but he is still a formidable proposition and
gave Patterson the run of his life last year. It seems
unlikely that Britain, will qualify to meet the winners
in the American zone. On paper France, which has
just beaten Denmark by four matches to one, should
again cross the Atlantic to tackle either Japan or
Australia.

This is G. C. Northcote, who stroked Gee-
long Grammar to vic-
tory in the Vic. Head
of the River schools'
championship in 1922
over Melbourne Gram-
mar. The crew behind
him averaged list.
91b., and he got the
best out of it. North-
cote looks like stroking
a Victorian eight event-
ually: the State has
had nothing more prom-
ising for years.
Darcy Ilatlfiekl
arrived in Sydney last
week for his cham-
pionship match with
Jim Paddon at Wood-
burn (N.S.W.). Had-
field won the Dominion
amateur sculling titles
in 1913 and 1915;
then he enlisted and
was wounded at Pass-
chendaele. After the
Armistice he won ihe
British Army cham-
pionship, defeating Alf
Felton (who after-
wards walloped Barry)
and others. Last year
he downed Arnst for
the M.L. title, but lost
to Paddon. He is 32,
broadly built, and
seems to be the only
man in the world
likely to extend the
giant Evans Head waterman.
Major Goodsell showed a glimpse of his
old ama.t e ur form in winning the first Australian mile
sculling championship on the Parramatta on Satur-
day; started in choppy water, and Billy
McDevitt led for the bulk of the journey. Then the
stylish Goodsell took charge and went on to win by
t/ .* n llsec. Reg Short was third.
Mrs. Wilshire won the women’s championship bv
three lengths, in Bmin. 58see.

.Tack Johnson (list. s Jib.) entered the
Sydney Stadium ring on Saturday night, one of
Newcastle’s long line of Coming Champions: he left
it, like many of his predecessors, in the arms of his
supporters. And so to St. Vincent’s Hospital, where he
was still in a bad way when this page went to press.
The destroying agency was Tommy Uren (lOst.
llflb.), a very different proposition as regards spend
and punching power from the man who was licked by
Frankie Burns and the Frenchman Francis Charles
a couple of years ago. Uren was superior' to the
youngster from the North at every point of the game.
He wore his inexperienced adversary down by re-
morseless punishment until the ISth, when, with the-
utmost coolness, he set the stage for the knock-out.
"he rattled Johnson was lured into letting go his
right, and, as he did so, Uren moved in and crossed
him on the chin. The Newcastle boy, game to the
last, made an instinctive effort to rise at “nine,” but
was all out. Uren has never shown to better advan-
tage ; but, then, he was boxing out of his class.
On Monday night the N.‘ S. Wales C. A.
decided to support Queensland’s application to take
part in Sheffield Shield cricket. Victoria is unde-
cided, while South Aus. recommends a conference
between the competing States. The Northerners
have improved of late years, and in P. M. Horni-
brook they unquestionably have the finest left-hand
bowler in the Commonwealth.
* * * •
George Hollingsworth Gordon, the big
N. S. Wales squatter, who died, aged 76, last week,
was an original member of the Albert: C. C. When
the old club’s ground was at Redfern he played
regularly and enjoyed a considerable local reputa-
tion. Then came age, and he finished his sporting
career as the wielder of a remarkably hot mallet at
croquet.

In Sydney ’Varsity inter-collegiate meet-
ing, last week, W. H. Hutton (holder of N.S.W.
championships) won 100yds. (lOJsec.), 220yds.
440yds. (5235ec.), and broad jump
(22it. Oiin.), thereby enabling .Wesley to re-
tain the Athletic Cup. In the open meeting, V. Rov
Harbison high-jumped sft. lOjin., Jin. better than
his brother’s 1920 record. Hutton took 220yds.
/o'??? 0 -)’, ,440yds. (52 3-ssec.). and broad jump

A. R. Callaghan did the half in 2min. 5 1-s'see. and
the mile in 4min. 53 l-ssec.

“Hamer”: Spencer Crackanthorp, who
emerged champion from the recent sanguinary conflict
of Australian chess heads, has been at it since infancy
His father was a champion before him. Further-
more, Spencer has a daughter, Nancy, who at six
years of age beat him in an exhibition game. It
may be mentioned that the game wasn’t her own, but
a memorised one, and, not to make it too difficult,
Dad kept to the moves of the losing player.
* * * *
“Ex-Englishman”: Scotland’s recent Rugby
win over Wales was its first on Welsh soil for 33
years. In the last minute the ball came out to Gracie,
the Scotch captain, who had just previously been
pretty well knocked- out by a heavy tackle and fall.
With a swerving run and a feint at passing he got
over, but so close to the ropes that, as he dived
across the line, he knocked several teeth out of a
spectator.
* * *
The hackneyed term “ashes” for a trophy
of success was given a practical turn on the recent
visit of Tasmanian bowlers to Adelaide. After they
had been beaten on the green, Tregear, their man-
ager, bought an urn, and at the farewell dinner
invited all present to drop the ash of their cigars
into it. Then he left it ill the keeping of the local
bowlers, with a pleasant challenge to them to take
it over to Hobart and battle for the keeping of it.
THE MASTER GAMBLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Smugly the preacher rolls his eyes.
“Ah, do not bet!” he says,
Avoid the racecourse, friends,” he cries,
“And its immoral ways.”
"Amen! Amen!” his hearers drone,
And this is more than odd,
Since many lawyers hymns intone
Beneath this man of God.
Now change the scene. Within a court
A bevy of Chinese
Await their sentence, stern and short.
The Bench’s words are these:
“You have been gambling and a fine
Won’t meet your case, I fear.”
The lawyers’ honest faces shine:
“Quite right!” they nod, “Hear, hear!”
In Parliament a lawyer speaks:
“This bill,” he says, “is aimed
To fill up certain gaps or leaks
In previous Acts, which claimed
To cheek the gambling that holds sway
Around us day and night.
The Law shall be obeyed, I say,
As is but just and right.”
On every side the lawyers slate
The man who disregards
Their views and bets on Cup or Plate,
At twb-up, dice or cards.
But this I know: Of all the mad,
Wild risks I ever took,
Of all the gambles, rash and bad,
’Neath which my fortunes shook,
The worst and most demented was when being young
and raw,
I backed a “silk” to win for me inside a court of law.

24/5/’2!
Australian history is steadily mellowing.
May 13 was the 136th anniversary of the
sailing of the First Fleet from England.
“Nollig”: I’m fed-up of being knocked
out every time I trot out a Tassie champion.
But I’ll have one more try. We’ve got a
tree, down the Huon way, over 360 ft. high :
and in the same locality an apple-tree shed
296 bushels.
“The Deacon”: When “0.K.” recalled the
visit of Lord Roseberv to Australia 40 years
ago (B. 10/5/’23) he didn’t mention that
one of the objects of the trip was to see
a relative in the sainted city. There Prim-
rose’s brewery supplied the necessary commo-
dity to the South Australian proletariat, and
its owner brought up a family of Good Aus-
tralians. One girl became an artist and
designer; another, Addie, is the authoress
of a book or two of verse and prose. Prior
to her marriage a few years back, some ot
her verses were printed in The Bulletin.
“Sixenate” : George Waite, who succeeded
old Arthur Vernon as sec. of the Sydney
United Laborers’ Union, and is the most vig-
orous opponent within the Labor movement
of “Red” influences, has been making perti-
nent inquiries about where the money came
from to give Jock Garden and his co-trippers
their jaunt to Russia. There were five be
side Garden; and to meet the considerable
expense an appeal was made to the unions.
They took the matter very coldly, and even
those few who did subscribe voted just about
enough to provide Garden with the new suit
and overcoat with which he departed. But
there was a hurried exchange of cables, and
the delegates went without any further
appeals for coin.
Two historic centenaries occur this year.
The first is the death of Colonel Johnston, who
came in the First Fleet as a lieutenant of
Marines, then joined the N. S. Wales Corps,
and was in command when certain colonists
demanded that he should depose Governor
Bligh. He complied, was tried by court-martial
and cashiered. “A very mild sentence,’’ said
the Prince Regent, when formally assenting,
“considering the gravity of the oflenee.’
Johnston returned to his home at Annandale,
and died on Jan. 6, 1823. The other cen-
tenary is that of Dr. John Dunmore Rang,
the first Presbyterian minister, who arrived
in Sydney in May and preached his first ser-

“Hori”: I question the statement (B.
5/4/’23) that the just-demolished Woodville
Hotel (Q.), on tlie St. Lawrence-road. 40
miles from Rockhampton, was once kept
by bushranger Frank Gardiner. Frank
Christie, alias Frank Gardiner, and hi! B
partner Craig, kept a hotel and store at
Apis Creek, a little over 100 miles from
Rockhampton, on what was then the main
road to the Peak Downs goldfield. Ibis
building must have been demolished long
ago; to my knowledge nothing remained of
it in the late ’eighties. Unless all my autho-
rities are at fault, an individual who an-
swered to the name of “Flash Charlie bom-
faced the Woodville Hotel during the period
that Gardiner dispensed snake-juice at Apis
Creek, where he was arrested on March
3, 1864.
The High Court has partly confirmed and
partly upset the S.A. Supreme Court judg-
ment in the complicated dispute over the
estate of old G. S. Kingston, father of C.C.
G.S. was one of the leading men in the very
early days of S.A. —he helped Light to lay
out the city of Adelaide —and he _ acquired
several landed properties. Now his grand-
children are urging that his trustees were
too favorable to C.C. (who was childless)
about 25 years ago. Judge Parsons ruled
that they had failed to' establish any claim.
The High Court, by Adrian Knox and
Starke, has held that the transfer to C. C.
Kingston’s wife of the land near Brighton
was good, but that the Noarlunga land must
be transferred back to the estate of G. S.
Kingston. They added that Mrs. C. C. had
acted honestly and in good faith. But Jus-
tice Higgins cautiously expressed disagree-
ment with his colleagues on that point.
“0.K.” : Shareholders in a prosperous 00.
for the sale of a meat-juice preparation sat
enraptured recently while a learned doctor,
Sir James Crichton Browne, orated as fol-
lows: “There are in meat-juice certain ac:ds
which the body cannot synthesise or form
for itself, but which are essential to vigor-
ous growth and vigorous health; so if we
would ward off deficiency diseases, which
might end in constitutional bankruptcy, we
should take plenty of meat-juice.” If this
should catch the eye of Bernard Shaw, the
vegetarian, we may hear of something to Sir
James Crichton Browne’s disadvantage.
Anyhow, human strength that draws no suc-
cor from a flesh diet seems to have a virtue
of calm persistency which the strength <f
. the steak-eater lacks. There is vigorous
health apart from lustiness. The. vege-
tarian finds tongues in peas, books in the
cunning cooks, sermons in scones, and food
in any old thing. Ask Bernard Shaw.
Browne’s meat is Pshaw’s poison.
“E.F.”: Municipally there is still much
to be done in most Melbourne suburbs, abd
in some of them there is nearly everything
to do. At Batman you have the Lincoln
Knitting Mills, employing 1000 hands, and
a rapidiy-increasing population. Situated but
half-an-hour by tortoise from the great
metropolis, it still has a train service only
once an hour, and no sewerage, no gas, no
electric light. Householders are restricted
to tank water for domestic needs, and in
this time of drought, in the continuation ot
the ancient suburb of Coburg, they are cart-
ing water for washing and drinking pur-
poses. But even in unsewered Batman the
nose meets fewer malodors than at, say,
Bendigo, the Golden City. People who go
to Bendigo to get cured of chest complaints
are not unlikely to suffer the fate of the
18th-century versifier who wrote: —
I sent for Radcliff, was so ill
The other doctors gave me over ;
He felt my pulse, prescribed a pill,
And I was likely to recover.
But when the wit began to wheeze,
And wine had warmed the politician,
Cured yesterday of my disease,
I died last night of my physician.
The butchers’ shops of Bendigo are a para-
dise of flies, the gutters smell like a bad
man’s reputation, and if the health inspec-
tor casts his eye over a rubbish-tip not far
from the city’s proud heart he will sometimes
find on its summit a banquet of bullocks’
entrails to tempt the local vermin.

Moiseiwitsch continued his concert season
in Sydney on Monday night, with a pro-
gramme that included Mozart, Chopin, Scar-
latti and a group of composers of the light
and sparkling school. Moiseiwitsch came
back tins time more of a showman though
none the less an artist. His playing is such
that even the unmusical man iu the street
is exhilarated, and forgets to wonder what
on earth people can see in “this highbrow
stuff.” The Rachmaninoff prelude and Medt-
ner’s “JLdylle” were particularly charming
items on a well-contrasted programme. On
Thursday afternoon and Saturday the pian-
ist will offer musical meals d la carte.
At Sydney Criterion “The Cat and the
Canary” continues its mission of making
dainty flesh creep and sending shivers down
lightly-upholstered spines. Also it raises
hair, when there is anything capillary to
elevate, on the gleaming domes that dot the
stalls.

Maud Fane bids her last, long, lingering
farewell to Sydney admirers to-night, in
“You’re in Love,” at the Theatre Royal. On
Saturday the curtain will rise on “Chu Chin
Chow,” the spectacular production where-
with massive Oscar held London’s fancy and
favor for five years.
No slackening is visible or audible in the
spell of “Sally,” at Sydney Majesty’s. The
alluring piece of goods has reached its
20th mad, glad week of popular favor.

To stop the tears that Julius Knight’s
departure- had set flowing, Sydney Tivoli
introduced on Saturday a three-act piece of
hilarity. Comedian Gus McNaughton, aided
and abetted by Jesse Sweet and a capital
company, set out to wipe the dust off the
windows of a seven-storeyed building. When
the#curtain drops the windows may still be
hopelessly grimed, but the audience has been
considerably brightened. A promising pair
of newcomers are Lloyd and Montrose —the
masculine half would be doubly acceptable
if he could only strangle an inane tendency
to make weak puns.
* * * *
On Monday next (28th) Walter Kirby’s,
tenor notes will so warm the air of Sydney
Town Hall with their golden glow that the
City Fathers will probably cut off the elec-
tric supply for radiators.
“Smilin’ Through,” at Sydney Globe, is
the non-articulate version of the spoken play
of the same title that is collecting Mel-
bourne’s rtioney at present. It is a spo.oky
affair, running back to the days before
Cornelius and Constance, the Riviera dancers
at the Sydney Tivoli, in their doll dance.
Amurrica made chewing-gum. Norma Tal-
madge plays the dual role, and the beautiful
scenery, human and otherwise, almost bal-
ances the weakness of the plot. “Theodora”
(unrelated to the Queensland monarch) has
invaded the Lyceum and Lyric. It is, so it
is claimed, the most sensationally-spectacular
picture ever filmed. Nobody else has ever
turned 30 lions upon a mob of 25,000 citi-
zens —the most this paper knows of hitherto
is 29 lions and one mouse. The Strand opens
its doors for Rodolph Valentino to enter as
“The Young Rajah.” The gush this land’s
fair sex spills over the foreign gentleman
must cause grave concern to White Australia
devotees.
Sydney women and their paint:—
A strong craft section is the most attractive feature
of the Women Painters’ annual exhibition at the
Education Galleries in Sydney. The thoroughness
and good workmanship that have produced Mrs. Hal
Eyre’s pottery and many of the other craft exhibits
are not so conspicuous in the pictures, which on the
whole fall below the standard reached by this
society last year. Miss Ethel Stephens’s fruit and
flower pieces are the most refreshing. They are

“The O'Brien
Girl,” at Mel-
bourne Princess's.
strong in the suggestion of atmosphere, but color
extravagance puts them and the balance of her other-
wise interesting work outside the category of per-
fectly normal art. Miss Constance Moser contributes
a half-dozen attractive landscapes. Wisely content
with simple subjects she goes far to realise them;
but the result would be better if more care were
given, and if she let her subject dictate the nature
of her technique. The Misses Norah Gurdon, Jessie
Brooks, Cmce Hoy and Frank Payne are others
responsible for bright spots.
SMILIN’ THROUGH.
Outside the Gates of Paradise, or other mystic, place,
A pair of long-dead mothers meet in converse, face
to face—
Like fairy queens in pantomime they state the job
they’re on,
Which is a wedding to arrange, in spite of Uncle
John ;
And therefore one is not surprised to learn, by
Uncle’s look,
That when not playing dominoes he’s talking to a
spook.
The phantom is, in fact, his Girl of fifty years ago,
Whom Jeremiah Wayne had slain because he loved
her so—
The Girl whom youthful Uncle John had been about
to wed,
When Jeremiah’s pistol fire killed the lady dead.
Now she it is who comes to soothe poor faithful
John’s distress:
She wears a pretty bridal wreath, likewise a bridal
dress,
And when he fain would have her there, her beauty
to extol,
Old John devotes a full-moon night to fooling with
a dorl.
A vision of the fatal day when Moonyeen Glare got
shot
Is reproduced before our eyes, upon the very spot
Where Uncle John is living now; for Jeremiah’s son,
Not knowing what an awful deed his drunken dad
had done,
Is making love to sw:ite Kathleen) a damsel dark and
fair,
Who’s deep in love with him, although her mother
was a Clare;
And there, to Uncle John’s dismay, the lovers
mingle spoons,
The brogue of Kathleen being quite the same as
Allen Doone’s.
In vain the spook of Moonyeen Clare old Johnny
doth upbraid
In tones much gentler than we get from Hamlet’s
father’s shade.
She cannot patch the trouble up ; her ghostly heart
is sore
When Kathleen’s sweeheart, Kenneth Wayne, is
hurried to the war.
Old Uncle John will not relent; morose in age he
grows;
No more he plays his ancient chum, the Doc., at
dominoes.
And thus the drama, maunders on until the dreary
Doc.
Brings Kenneth back, a damaged boy, a siifierer
from “shock.”
Ken soon repeats some mushy lines once taught him
by Kathleen,
And peace, and love, and charity shed glory on the
scene.
There is a climax still to come: old Uncle droops
his head,
Whilst Moonyeen’s spook, as sweet and young as
when she first was dead,
Appears to call his spirit hence. Beside the John
who’s gone
There next appears, to our surprise, another Uncle
John.
And off he goes, this dear old friend, set free from
care and toil,
With Moonyeen to the Great Beyond—the land of
Conan Doyle.

At Melbourne Royal, where Gertrude
Elliott sheds her winsome smile, everything
remains as sweet as pie with the exception
of Jeremiah in the dream scene. As a
drunken murderer, who suffers nothing for
his crime, Jeremiah must ever be the solitary
fly in the syrup of “Smilin’ Through,” It is
probably on account of his evil-soUttdiag
name. Stage Jeremiahs are always dislik-
able.

At three Melbourne theatres the play is
about to take up its bill and walk. At Mel-
bourne King’s, where the entertainment has
battled along some weeks on a company of
five souls and half a change of scenery, the
show next Saturday will be “Quarantine.”
An 'increase of company is required to sup-
port Lawrence Grossmith in this case.
On Saturday the new Palace, in Mel-
bourne, is to discard “Bulldog Drummond”
in favor of “A Faithful Heart,” which organ
will belong doubtless to G.-H. Mulcaster or
the stage lady who loves him. Anyhow, Mul-
caster is the bill-topper, and Beryl Bryant
and Nellie Mortyne are joining the co. for
the production.

At Melbourne Majesty’s the Royal Comics
close their season to-night (Thursday), and
on Saturday the other musical co. will start
12 nights of revivals, with Maud Fane as
chief fareweller. Maudie is said to be quit-
ting the stage for the Simple Life, and,
though she will appear in “A Night Out” on
Saturday, she will severely disapprove of
its prevailing sentiment.
The last glorious weeks of “The O’Brien
Girl,” at Melbourne Princess’s, are still in
course of evolution. It was easier for Hugh
Ward to threaten the withdrawal of this
joyous, musical comedy than to say exactly
when it will be withdrawn.

In Melbourne on Saturday night Gerardy
simply enmeshed the hearts of his audience
in a web of golden melody. He opened with
the St. Saens A Minor Concerto with its deli-
cately melodious theme and vivid bravura
conclusions; and after a delightful Bach aria
and a Popper item ended up with Davidoff’s
“At the Spring” and other melting melodies.
But a man who can knock soulfulness out
of “God Save,” as Gerardy can, will be cap-
able of wresting honors from the heavenly
harpists. George Stewart McManus was a
shade. heavy-handed for Chop’n. but did splen-
didly in Grieg’s “Caprice” and an encore num-
ber. Miss Essie Ackland, whose lower notes
are a great asset, sang with less distinction
of tone than will be expected of her pre-
sently. But her way of doing her share is
a factor in these concerts’ popularity.
As “The Young Rajah,” at Hoyt’s, Mel-
bourne, Rodolph Valentino will excite the
Hindu correspondent of the Tailor and
Cutter. His clothes are gorgeous, even if
his mission is.mushy; and Hoyt’s male sup-
porters are given something to ogle in his
shapely playmate, Wanda Hawley. On the
same programme the Australian production
“Circumstance” alters the faces of a well-
drilled throng, including a vision called
Yvonne Pavis. The miniature Wesley Barry
is the right bower that euchres a crook in
the Majestic’s modest nightmare, “Heroes of
the Street.” Marie Prevost is a diverting
side-show as a Broadway dancing-star.
** * *
A show with a sentimental interest:—
A post-mortem of the late Miss Henrietta Irvine’s
pictures at the Vic. Artists’ Society reveals that she
always looked at Australian landscape through a
French impressionist’s eyes. She was hazy and un-
satisfying in water-colors. In oils she had an
effusive palette. A representative sample of her work
is “Backwater, Heidelberg,” which reminds one of
the exclamatory viridescence of Albert Enes’s can-
vases that had considerable attention in Melbourne 10
or more years ago. “Malvern Gardens in Winter” is
less vehement, but even though it affords a fair idea
of doleful weather under big, spreading trees, it is
suggestive of the artist’s foreign education. Miss
Irvine was stronger in portraiture, and, with few
exceptions, she always brought out cleverly the sit-
ter s personality. “La Bretonne” is about her best
a study of an old lady with a dim, shadowed face
and convincing, toil-worn hands. “A Russian Stu-
dent” is soundly modelled, and the swirling pig-
ment, apparently slapped in with a vigorous brush,
adds to the barbaric quality of the subject.
At Melbourne Town Hall a packed house
at Saturday’s orchestral matinee riddled fur-
ther holes in the moth-eaten argument that
an imported conductor is the one tiring
necessary to attract the musical crowd, Beeb
hoven’s C Minor Sonata was the hots-
d'centre of the meal: its soul-stirring varia;
tions and rhythmic ’cello moments got full
justice from the Zelmah baton. Subse-
quently the conductor invested “Don Juan"
(Strauss) with the appropriate atmosphere
of passionate naughtiness, Frances de Bouf-
guignon, after a few bars of nervousness,
supplied a finished interpretation of Grieg’s
cheerful A Minor Concerto, with a stirring
orchestral backing, The final course Was the
"Flying Dutchman” overture, in which Wag-
ner pictured with devilish ingenuity the sea
captaih in grips With Satan. Even the
monotony of “God Save” Was livened by a
drum-rolling accompaniment. Verbruggliert
had his players disciplined like a regiment Of
soldiers ready to hop off at the word Of
command, and they played with a scholarly
precision and Classic brilliahcjr which glad-
dened the mUsiCally-trained mind. Zelmatt,
whose inimical outpourings ooze from his
SbUl, leads rather than commands, seeking to
inspire his little lot with the poetry and fire
of his own imaginings._ Audiences admired
the Verbrugghen technique; they love Zel-
man’s atmosphere.

The rendering of Shaw’s “Major Barbara”
by the Repertory Theatre in Adelaide raises
the whole question of the duty of players to
an author. Where, as here, there is in the
producers’ opinion too much talk before the
action begins, and an ocean of it after the
play is really over and the curtain due to be
down, should reverence prevent it being cut,
as “Hamlet” is cut? It seems to be a mat-
ter between the author and the producers:
whether the latter have the right to alter
the ’script without the author’s consent—if he
is living—is very doubtful. A packed house
attended the first of the two performances,
and laughed most heartily, perhaps, at the
religious tags in the Salvation Army scene.
Beryl Ivook was very good as Barbara, who
deserts the Army only oh its accepting big
cheques from her father the cannon-maker
and his rival the brewer, Thomas Nave,
too, wag nearly at his best as the munitions
millionaire and cold-blooded sentimentalist.

to be near Barbara, and who eagerly claims
to be disrespectable in England because his
perfectly respectable mother in Australia
was a deceased wife’s sister, is a Gilbertian
character, and Basil Harford did it justice.
Harford started as simply an elocutionist,
but is much more than that now. Three
others of a large cast had quite the profes-
sional touch: Ethelwvn Robin as the aristo-
crat mother, with epigrams, Bert Datson and
George McLeay (the best work either of
them has ever done) as dubiously converted
patrons of the Army. Ray Walsh produced
the play, but took no part in it.

With the Royal closed for the moment.
Adelaide shows rely mainly on variety and
pictures. At the Majestic Daisy Jerome has
ended her season with competitions for local
aspirants who want to be like her; Colleano
does some good things on the wire at this
house. At the Prince of Wales the four
Darkie singers carol old things and new.
Togo the Jap does some effective juggling,
and Decima McLean, the agile kiddy of
Darto days, has grown into a strikingly
graceful dancer.

“SUNTYNE” The Grain and Fertilizer Drill with Spring Tynes.
Cuts out all the soil to the desired depth of sowing. Destroys
all the weeds. Plants the seed on a flat, compacted surface
and covers every grain with a blanket of pulverised soil. This
conserves the rising moisture for the benefit of the seed, hastens
germination, and causes vigorous growth and increased
yields. No progressive farmer can afford to ignore this system.
Catalogues and quotations sent promptly on request.
Made with 17, 25, 29, 33 or 41 Tynes, sowing respectively
8, 12, 14, 16 or 20 rows. Rows spaced 7 inches apart. Tynes
are in four ranks, and have 4-inch points. Rigid Tynes
supplied for well-cleared land, in lieu of Spring Tynes. Sows
seed and fertilizer in any desired quantities. Combines two
implements in one, as it may be used as a cultivator only.
Will sow oats on stubble land in one single operation and give
good results.

“F.A.H.”: Accident made the late Fred

Fred fell backwards and disappeared from

unknown comedian.”
i “Nero” : When the late John Fuller passed
west from Auckland last week the manage-
ment of Fuller’s Opera House improved the
shining hour as follows: —
Business as Usual.
To our many Patrons: Mr. John Fuller, senior,
has passed away. It was his expressed wish that
when he was called away the theatre should remain
open. W'e ha\e obeyed his last wish and would
advise that the show
Is Bigger and Brighter than Ever.
Prices 1/-, 2/-, 2/6, 3/-, plus tax.
“Not’d”: On a recent Sunday a punt laden
with motor-lorries containing Stanley
Me tv ay’s pantomime outfit sank whilst
crossing the Clarence Kiver at Harwood
(N.S.Vv.). The waters closed over a canvas
theatre, staging, seating, scenery, wardrobe,
and an elective-light plant, and it was 18
hours before the salvage gang retired for
the.r well-earned beer. But two days later
the panto, co. was going as strong as ever
at Coraki. Some of the tished-out “effects”
had been dried on fences and trees, and
measures for the restoration of the appa-
rently-drpwned had been applied to the light-
ing and scenery. Your travelling mummer is
a cheerfully resourceful chap.
“M. 8.” (Eng.) : A pretty compliment was
paid to Floience Austral lust week in Man-
cuester. Sue was s.ng.ng at a Sunday con-
cert, and one of the other “performers” was
the llorwieh 11.M.1. Band, which won the
champ.onsh p at the Crystal Palace lust Sep-
tember. There were only a few minutes
lefc, and the concert had to close. Florence
Austral had just rendered “One Fine Day,”
from “Butteifiy,” and for a final number
the audience was asked to choose between uer
and the famous band. The Australian was
selected. Her voice is of an excellent timbre,
anu she is gradually learning how io use _t.
Her operatic experience with the British
National Opera Co. is w-dening her horizon,
and she bids fair to soon be one of the most
popular singers in Britain.
“Skyrider”: Allan Wilkie and “Caesar’s
Ghost” (B. 17/5/’23) are ungenerous to
Goulburn (N.S.W.). The two local papers
gave Wilkie columns of eulogy, the
schools took the k.ds along to see how
Shakspeare should be played, and if their
parents stayed away it was largely because
they didn’t rel.sh plugging through a howling
westerly to pay 'is. ror reserved seats. Bet
Allan go back to the southern highlands in
the summer on a three- and four-bob tariff,
and he'll get quite a shock. Goulburn beard
Verbrugghen’s orchestra for two bob. A bob,
mummer-managers must, remember, looks far
larger in the country these times than it
does in the bloated cities.
“Norbell”: Many touring shows have
crashed at Goulburn (B. 17/5/’22). I went
there for two nights \yith Li /iw trey in the
“Message from Mars” 20 years ago, and we
cadre a—er —stomacher. I was there
again with Nellie Stewart 12 years ago ; we
tried “Sweet Nell” for two nights, but on
seeing the house the sardonic George Mus-
grove advised us to speak in whispers for
fear of disturbing the citizens, and to walk
Lome in our stockinged’ feet lest we w^k ll
the town. Hilda Srong did “Everywoman”
there to a few shillings. All strangers in
Goulburn are looked cn with suspicion. If
they happen to be actors as well, the suspi-
cion becomes a certainty.
“Stephen S.”: “T.IYs” SOS (B.
10/5/'23) revived an old memory of George
Beitch playing lead in “The Madman” at
the Victoria Theatre, Newcastle (N.S.W.).
That was in the late ’eighties, w hen flappers
didn’t discuss paranoia and psychology be-
tween sundaes; and, from a med-Cal viewpoint,
anyhow, Beitch’s rendering of a part that
teemed with pit-alls for the ordinary barn-
stormer was a finished piece of work. It was
a grisly, haunting two-act piece, similar to
“The Bells,” and I fancy that Leitch cre-
ated the lead in Australia.
“Norbell” : The play mentioned by “T.P.”
(B. 10/5/23) was called “Coming llome, or
Sithors to Grind.” George Leitch, who - ap-
peared under Williamson, Garner and Mus-
grove’s management (place, Melbourne Prin-
cess’s; date, Nov. 17, 1883), was Joe Stam-
mers (“as played by him over 1000 times
in the U.K.”), and this was the rest of the
cast: Tom Stammers, 11. W. Bennett; Ted
Bluff, C. H. Fenton; Lord Templemore, H.
R. Jewett; Mr. Hackute, Oily Deering;
Eleanor Stammers, Rosa Towers; Milly
d.tto, Alma Sail ton; Eglantine ditto, Amy
Crawford; Finette, Pattie Brown. “T.P.”
says it was “a delightful idyll,” but to the
Argus it “did not give one a very exalted
idea of the taste and intelligence of tlie
playgoing public in the mother country to
be to’d that such a poor production has been
played there for 1000 nights.” It lingered
for two Weeks, supplemented for the last few
nights by Fleming Norton’s one-man, quick-
change show, “The Picnic.” Leitch couldn’t
write an “idyll,” or act anything but the
Insect in “Paul Jones,” to save his soul
alive.
“Pedro”: I can inform “T.P.” (B.
10/5/23) that George Leitch wrote a sen-
timental little Dickensy play called “Sithors
to Grind.” Another thing from his pen was
a semi-psychological drama, “A Touch of
the Sun,” mainly about a madman in a
velvet coat who used to yell “Ha. ha!” at
odd times. Leitch played the leading parts
in these himself, as he d'd the principal
comedy role in his Maori play, which ne
produced at the Sydney Royal. His nom-de-
tMatre —some people said that it was his
real name —was George Bslnh Walker, I
saw* the two first-mentioned pieces at the
Wellington (M.L.) Theatre Royal in the
late ’eighties, when Leitch and Jimmy Mac-
mahon were partners. As for Le.tch ben g
“a mere low comedian incapable of writing
a poem with a stage setting.” he had literal y
skill, was a master of stagecraft, and wrote
tne first Australian version of von Moser s
“Der Blbliotheker.” afterwards known here
as "The Private Secretary.”
From “W.M.,” the walking encyclopaedia
of the Victorian Club (Melb.) :
Tell “T.P.” (B. 10/5/’23) his memory hasn’t de-
ceived him about “Sithcrs to Grind. ’ 'the first
performance happened at the Princess's Theatre on
Nov. 17, 1883.
“Ilamfat” : The travelling showman is in
revolt against the high charges exacted for
country halls, particularly at holiday-time.
Phillip Lytton struck them the first blow by
PROVED IT IN HIS OWN CASE.
“I wonder why more people don't go in for singing
— it’s so good for the health.”
“I'm sure it is. The girl next door drives us all out
into the open air every Sunday afternoon.”
introducing the tent theatre—-he calls it his
“Canvas Theatre Royal.” Now George
Sorlie has imported what is known in Eng-
land as a “fit-up”— i.e., a square tent con-
taining all the appurtenances of a theatre,
even boxes. Country hall-owners who miss
the rents the Lyttons and Sorlies used to
weigh in with are feeling bitter, but many of
them invited the kick they are getting.
From the Players’ Club, of N’York: —
Because membership of the Players, is a distinc-
tion here; because only men. who have done some-
thing worth while .for art, literature or drama can
“belong” ; because Bob Dexter is their newest mem-
ber ; because he is a “dinkum Aussie,” and because
I thought you would like to know, I am writing
this in the library, while the neophyte is in the
smoke-room explaining the White Australia policy
to the literati.
When Edwin Booth gave this fine home of his vo
the newiy-formed Players’ Club in 1888, it was
(and still is) crammed with valuable historic
relics and works of art which mark the path of
American progress in the arts. On Christmas
Eve, 1888, Booth stood with his back to the
quaint, cavernous .fireplace and read the deed of
dedication to a gathering of America’s greatest
artists, writers and actors; on each succeeding Christ-
mas Eve that dedication has been read to the mem-
bers by outstanding men, amongst them Chauncey
Drpew, President Grover Cleveland. John Drew,
Mark Twain, Augustus Thomas ar.d William Gillette.
After the original ceremony a wonderful old loving-
cup, presented by William Warren to Joseph Jeffer-
son, was handed arour.d, that all present might drink
to “The Players’ perpetual prosperity.” To-day the
same toast is drunk from the same old cup, and the
vintage compares favorably with the best of pre-
prohibition days.
The Players’ Club is a venerable old place; mem-
bership is greatly coveted; Bob Dexter has won a
place in this holy of holies and a popularity amongst
its members that does us all credit.
Membership is restricted to 400. Australians have
wen four seats to date; they are held by Percy
Waxman, associate-editor of the Pictorial Review ;
J. O’Hara Cosgrave, editor New York Sunday World ;
O. P. Heggie, the well-known actor; and now Dexter
drapes the early-Victorian fiddle-back mahogany.
“Second Murderer”: Actors do sometimes
“just stroll on and say whatever comes into
their heads” (B. 3/5/’23). In one thriller,
“The Royal Pardon.” T mmy Cosgrove had
a long scene with the villain, Charles h lelci.
It was part of the villain’s business to rise
from his seat with an ind gnant It s a
i e,” whereupon the other sternly commanded
him to “Sit down.” But when Tommy came
on he forgot every word of the scene, and
stood tongue-tied, glaring ■ na l l f na ™ r ! ' l is;
Field who was seated in a deck-chair. ‘ 'Veil.
asked Field easily. “Sit down. shouted
Tommy. “But I am sitting down, said the
villa’n bland’y. Tommy glared, gasped and
thundered, “Then stay there!” And hur-
ried off.
“Willie ?”: During Allan Wilkie’s latest
Tasmanian tour “The Merchant of Venice
was played to an audience that was m 'Stlj
schoolgirl. Bobbed-liair and Pigtail kept
fairly quiet until Shylock en-
tered as the Venetian revellers
made their exit, shout.ng “Viva,
viva!” Thereupon there were
shrieks of merriment. Nobody
behind could understand why
until a front-of-tlie-house man
elucidated the mystery. “They
think the Dagoes are calling the
old Yid ‘Beaver, beaver !’ ”
“Fax”: An almost forgotten
circumstance in Australian
vaudeville is that Ada Reeve did
a turn on the Rickards circuit
(not that Rickards had much
of a circuit at that time) as
long ago as 1898. She had then
completed her engagement with
J.C.W.. and was making some
vaudeville fees preparatory to
returning to England. Her
principal ditty was “What Do
I Care?” and her rival in the
centre of the bill was Peggy
Pryde.
“Alastor” : The tradition’ that
Brisbane can’t support a perma-
nent show is by way of being
broken by Billy Moloney, who,
with Humphrey Bishop, runs
Cremorne, and has been doing
it for two years. A versatile
citizen, Billy is equally at home
as manager, producer and actor,
and if the co. is short of a song
he can turn one out himself.
His “Indooroopilly” and “Woo-
Fongabba” are warbled from
Thargomindnli t o Thursday
Island. There is a story that
“Indooroopilly” has earned its
author £6OO in six months, but
perhaps a nought has been
added in transmission. 'The
average Australian song-writer
would be liuhie „to die of heart
failure if his profits exceeded a
fiver.
“Norbell”: Yes, Charles Kenningham
could certainly act as well as sing (B.
10/5/’23). He was selected by Gilbert to
play in “Pygmalion and Galatea” in the
Diamond Jubilee year. For some years bis
hearing has been slowly but surely deterio-
rating. till now he can no longer teach sing-
ing. But tell “Hamfat” that Charlie is not
at present in business in Sydney. Unfor-
tunately three gruelling abdominal opera-
tions have left him unable to work. Luckily
he can still compose.
“Whitebait”: Monckton Hoffe, the author
of “The Faithful Heart,” which follows
“Bulldog Drummond” at the Melbourne
Palace, was also responsible for the “Little
Damozel,” in which Emelie P'olini appeared
in Australia three years ago. Hoffe, whose
real name is Heaney Monckton Hoffe-Miles,
is an Irishman with a dozen or more plays
to his credit, of which the best known, apart
from the “Damozel,” is “Proper Peter,”
though Peter was first christened “Im-
proper,” and wore that adjective on the play-
bills for a while. Mrs. Monckton Hoffe
(Barbara Conrad) has done a. bit on the
stage, her best part being Joanna Trout in
Barrie’s “Dear Brutus,” staged at Wynd-
ham’s Theatre, London, in 1917.
"Philm Up”: A grateful public and a
small fortune await the picture-showman
who will present photo-plays in a sensible
fash.on. At present the film is rushed
through at such a pace that it is impossible
to follow the story, study the various char-
acters, or properly grasp the situations. I
grant that this state of things has its ad-
vantages, for very few movie plots can be
taken seriously, and to unfold them slowly
for inspection would be to court the ribald
laugh of the crit cal. But a good story skil-
fully acted, and produced in a natural,
coherent manner, would, I feel certain, hold
the attention of spectators and make a vivid
impression. As it is, I defy any man to
remember anything about the sup'er-m‘'-s<-er-
piece two days after he has seen it. Which
again, perhaps, is an advantage.
NOT TO BE CAUGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A fearless critic,” he was dubbed, August Eustace
Pyzer,
Who did the “Drama” column for the S'ydmelb
Advertiser.
He stood alone —and proudly so —in being indepen-
dent.
He thought and said Australian art should be in the
ascendant.
He very rarely praised a play—it tcok a lot to
please him ;
While others warmed at t’mcs to shows, the best
but seemed to freeze him.
An over-boomed imported star ’twas odds that Gus
would slate him,
And Jinks, the leading manager, began, of course,
to hate him.
“He damages my trade,” said Jinks, “he’s really
. too free-spoken:
The question is—should I or he upon the wheel be
broken?”
A .notable first night arrived. Augustus came full
early,
And found the impresario, by reputation surly,
Most affably inclined. Quoth he, “It’s good to see
you blow in;
Come, , lad, into the office for a ‘spot’ before you
go in.”
One “spot.” two “spots,” uncounted “spots” —and
meanwhile rose the curtain —
The critic took; his speech grew thick, his eyes and
legs uncertain.
And still the manager stood by, and with the whisky
plied him,
Until his enemy dropped off, the dead marine beside
him.
And Gus slept on right through the show —oh, well
• the boss bad planned it!
The latter chuckled all the night, but couldn’t under-
stand it
When next morn in the ’Tiseii, just as he was loudly
boasting
Of how he’d “settled” ’Gus, he saw the usual old
“roasting” !
He recogtiised Augustus’ style, his sneers, his dog-
matism,
And then remembered how and whence had come
the criticism:
’Twas his own fault; his luck this time had suffered
a reversal,
For he'd invited ’Gus to see the final dress rehearsal !

Mr. Warner, who drove a

on Saturday, April 29.
The Manager,
Barnet Glass Rubber Co., Ltd.,
Sydney.
Dear Sir,
On the eve of my departure on my return journey to Western Australia, I deem it a pleasure in
congratulating you upon the tyres bought from your stock in W.A.
I left Perth on December 14, 1922, and travelled overland to Adelaide, Melbourne and Gippsland;
returned to Melbourne, through N.S.W., on to Queensland, and back along the North Coast Road, and south
to Sydney.
I have now travelled 6433 miles, and 1 am quite sure I will land back in Western Australia with
the same tyres as I left with, after travelling about 11,000 miles. These tyres will always do me.
Best wishes and prosperity. Yours truly,
' (Signed) J. K. WARNER,
26 Hamerstey Road, Subiaco, W.A.
This is only one of the many wonderful trials of endurance established on
BARNET GLASS BOOMERANG TYRES. Last year Mr. Murray Aunger and
party drove from Adelaide to Darwin and back on the one set of tyres, which
contained the same air on arrival as was placed in them on departure. Just
imagine! Across Australia without a puncture.
Sydney, 12th March, 1923.
For Resiliency f Long Wear and Comfort, BARNET GLASS TYRES are unsurpassable.

ables you to work as expeditiously
by night as by day, making it pos-
sible to complete your farming
operations on time. Time saved,
especially when seeding, means pro-
fitable production. Remember late
seeding often means a bad crop.
At all times the “CASE” is the ONE-

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
A’o notice (except of a hostile character) will bt
taken of communications insufficiently stamped,
hame and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted: and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Yallambee: But who make these “rules”
of grammar, and who gave them the right to do it?
I' rankly, we'll break any of them any time we think it
will help us to be more effective. And we sug-
gest that you do the same.. ..Tom Hah: It falls
over its own clumsy feet —especially in the second
verse... .8.F.C.: It sings; but what does it mean?
Anna R:. Too small potatoes F.K., NTm-
porte and others: In all the wide world there isn’t
a subject that we’re more tired 0 f than whether Shak-
speare was somebody else E.J.D.: Thanks. We ll
serve the medicine in homoeopathic doses King
K.: Not worth while Fisherman: Off The Bul-
uktin’s track... .Owen Kimberley: Misses in in-
terest; try again... .W.J.8.: Not worth the space.
....Rita: Merely identification patches... .Costigan :
You may know all about it; but old Sol’s tip is
mostly right—“He that hath knowledge spareth his
words.’’ Robert I.: Stamps must accompany MS.
if you want it returned 15. G.: Hard facts, cer-
tainly; but put a feather in their cap if you want
them looked at....Malob: Sorry can’t oblige you—
until elastic paper is invented. .. .8.5.: The pathos
of it:—
One day into a butcher’s shop
A hungry dog did stray,
And tried to steal a mutton chop
Which on the block did lay.
•lust then a lamb’s head and a fry
A lady came to buy;
She saw the dog was in sore strife,
When the man raised his knife.
“Oh, stay your hand,” the lady said,
“And I will buy dogmeat;
I could not sleep to-night in bed
If that dog’s naught to eat.”
One night whilst in a peaceful dream
there came a frightful note;
The lady heard a burgulafr’s scream—
The dog had fanged his throat.
. ...L.W.H.: Almost a pure London product, brought
to Australia by mailboat stewards. .. .Kon: Nothing
in it... .A.F.L.: Drags its weary length to a poor
conclusion... .Krui: “The War Horse” doesn’t thrill
us Harold ; P.: The sonnet is in bad shape, and
the verse poor. .. . W.M.8.: Not nearly.... Klancy :
Feed up your ideas a bit and then handle them
better. .. .Bellerive: The be-kind-to-animals item is
marred by a slight flaw in a rhyme, but what of
that!—
Two lonely men did shove the wheels;
A helping hand to give;
An eager crowd did gather -round
When father’s horse did jib ;
“Slash him with the bloomin’ whip,”
Did blurt some big galoot;
But father was a feeling man,
And spared the wretqhed brute.
He patted him upon the neck.
And scrambled in the cart;
Helpers give the wheels a jolt,
And off the nag did start.
He travelled like a speedful hare.
And no more trouble give;
“I’d easy stake a tenner,”
, Said'a cabby, “for the jib.”
K.M. (S.A.) : No good at all H.R.N.: As
heavy as the blaeksoil plains. ... Banansic: Too
slight. . . .A.E.G.: Alas that truth should so often be
dull! . . . .L.L. (St. Kilda) : Not for us. . . .Noskadge:
So small a point that if we printed it we should have
to give aw-ay a microscope with every copy. .. .
Dorothy D.: Not enough yarn there J.F.K.:
Doesn’t strike us W.H.S.: You don’t make much
of it. .. .N.F. (Maryborough): A dull heaping of
words S.V.D.: Between “supper” and 10 p.m.
two men and two women drank six and a half
bottles of whisky and could still argue over the
change. That’s your yarn; and we’d as soon believe
that Hickson can cure a wooden leg Midas: Your
witches are feeble f01k.... lieelee: Not enough inter-
est. .. .T.W.0.: Too rugged, .. .H.A.P.: An unimpres-
sive effort... .Constance C.: That soft of thing is
too easy to d 0... .Marjorie E.: As thin and weak as
boarding-house coffee when three extra have dropped
in for dinner A.E. and E.E.: They’ll have to be
better thought out than that.... Dynamite: Nothing
there to make a yarn... .A.P.W.: The sonnet is
lamest in its thought Fred A.: It limps along to
get to a very, small point... .W..J.T.: Your cake
isn’t well enough made, though the cooking isn’t
bad... .C.H.D.: They score an outer.... Suffenus:
Nicely done, but says too little J.F. (Pymble) :
“Billee” makes, a strange combination of noises, but
they are not musical. .. .M.C. (Yarroweyah) : Album
verse though of the better sort Julie M.: An old
theme and very unlikely K.11.A. : Wallows and
bumps all over the place T.8.P.: Feeble little
flutter... .Kate S.: You must study the sonnet form
first... .S.H.A.-Don’t like it... .Everybody: Put
your name and address on the copy. Your letter,
which is quite unnecessary, may become detached,
and if it is then married to the wrong MS. shock-
ing results may follow Waerradulla: Not up. The
sonnet, apart from its other faults, is in bad shape.
. ...A.E.M.: Your ear is uncertain. Watch your
rhymes H.A. S.: Badly told Stanley C.: You
make it quite incredible William O’C.: The verse
isn’t strong enough to carry it R.R.D.: Yarn
of insanity and coffee doesn’t please us. . . . W.R.F.:
The coi ned-beef-and-cabhage brand of commonplace.
■• ■ • E.M.11.: Sorry;, not up Malkah: Re-hash of
ancient ideas E.G.T.: Not half good Marjorie
P.: There is promise in them; but get something
fresher to say Arthur C.': Not much hope of sud-
den wealth in that direction T.M.W.: What!
Look at that same old patch of blue sky when m
trouble? The patch is clean worn but with the
scraping and bumping of bad verse... .W.M.D.: Not
enough in it. . . .A.W.D.: The sonnet doesn’t carry it.
....Kitty B.: Too small. .. .R.C.M.: If this country
were really civilised the crime of writing bad
Limericks in alphabetical order would be punished
by the stopping of your rum for a fortnight
A.A.K.: Badly done G.M. (Oama-ru) : No, thanks.
... .A.M.H.: You thrust a heavy handicap on your-
self when you put your typewritten lines through a
woolpress before you send them to us. The mind
that ought to be free to enjoy the matter is half
its time occupied in deciphering the script.

oAt the new price, everyone
can afford this luxury
can now enjoy the de-
lights and benefits derived from the
daily use of Palmolive Soap—the most
perfect toilet soap the world has ever
known--now sold at a price none need
hesitate to pay.
Coming events cast their shadows be-
fore! Thus, the early completion of
the Palmolive factory is preceded by
the most remarkable reduction—the
greatest value ever offered in a toilet
soap.
toilet Luxury at Household Cost
Every woman knows the cleansing and
beautifying powers of palm and olive
oils. Since the dawn of history these
oils have been used by lovely women
to enhance their beauty of complexion
and preserve their charms.
Palm and olive oils—nothing else—give
nature’s green colour to Palmolive Soap.
You cannot buy a better toilet soap—no
matter what you pay. For many cen-
turies the use of those fine oils, on
account of their great cost, was possible
only to the very rich. Palmolive Soap
changed this.
Now Used by Millions
The perfect blend of palm and olive
oils by modern scientific methods gives
to the world the perfect toilet soap—
Palmolive—at a price which places this
ancient luxury of the favoured few with-
in the reach of all.
Now that Palmolive Soap is used by
thousands of Australian families, it
becomes imperative that it should be
manufadured in Australia and, in
order to further increase the demand,
and thus give the Palmolive fadory a
fine start in life, Palmolive has been
reduced to l\d. per cake.
But there is no change in Palmolive.
The 7Hd. tablet is the same quality,
S’ze, weight and shape as in the past.
You cannot buy a better toilet soap
no matter what price you pay.

“Mixit”: The advantage of having more
than one string to a bow is being felt in
Adelaide just now. No rain at all fell in
April, and farming prospects looked bad;
but the flourishing local vine-growing indus-
try calls it a season that couldn’t be beaten,
and in particular promises a 1923 port which
will be the finest-flavored on record.
* * * *
“Bohnock”: “D.D.”(B. 3/5/’23) shouldn’t
place his wreath on the grave of manual
telegraphy until the sounder-box is no more.
Fifty years will pass, in my judgment, ere
the machine ousts the ticker from Common-
wealth operating-rooms. With the exception
the Mate capitals, Newcastle, Broken
ilill, Lismore and Bendigo, no country lines
“ av ® been fitted with machines. Towns such
as Taree, Parkes, Muswellbrook, Tenterfield,
1 orbes and Young are destined to know
only sounder and key owing to the fact that
they will never be repeating centres.
* * * ,
“Ooja”: Apropos “Bully B.’s” statement
that it is now unnecessary to import insula-
tor pans, as a W.A. timber has been found
suitable, I want to know who told him that
the Commonwealth imported these pins. I
have been working on telephone lines for
some time, and handle hundreds of pins in
a week, and have never yet seen one that was
not cut from good Australian hardwood.
Ironbark, spotted gum, bluegum and stringy ■
bark are all used. I don’t know exactly
what strain these pins are expected to stand,
but it is very seldom one breaks. I’ll back
a bit of decently-seasoned spotted-gum
against anything importable.
* * * * *
“Pantagruel”: Queensland’s cattle indus-
try has been given a bit of a fillip by the
launching of two big schemes at Karumba,
near Normanton. The Northern graziers are
establishing a meat-canning works, and the
plant has already been purchased. The State
Government has lent £15,000, and the pro-
moters are putting up a similar amount. The
same co. has taken advantage of the Federal
and State Government subsidies (10s. per
head in each case) on live cattle exported to
the East, and has purchased 10.000 head,
with an option over a further 6000. All
these cattle are destined for China and the
adjacent countries.
* * * *
“Sjxenate”: The N. S. Wales Govern-
ment s determination to shut down on the
sale of lottery tickets in the streets seems
to have resulted mainly in the attempt to
camouflage such _ enterprises with execrable
mechanical music. The new regulations
stipulate that ticket-sellers must not stand
m a public thoroughfare to dispose of their
wares. The sellers overcome the difficulty by
throwing a small piano-player into some
place contiguous to the footpath—picture-
show vestibules are favored—and appeal to
the passer-by to buy with volumes of unmelo-
dious sound. In one short strip of street I
struck four of these arrangements having a
sort of dogfight with one another. Instead
of stopping the lotteries the Law’s infirm
hands have only added another horror to life.
* * * *
“W.E.”: I would tell “Caerleon” (B
3/5/’23) that, though a jerrybuilder now, I
was once a happy farmer; but the day came
when an evil spirit prompted me to swap
the plough for the counter. I knew, like
“Caerleon,’’ the big difference between coun-
try and city prices, and so I mislaid my
conscience and joined the alleged robber
class —the country storekeepers. But I soon
found things were not what they seemed.
My first tour of the city houses, wholesale
and retail, -woke me up. I discovered the
big city retailers selling drapery, mercery,
ironmongery and many other lines just as
cheaply as I could buy wholesale. They were
dodging the importer’s profit, and I couldn’t;
also, they. were buying and selling for cash,
while I, like mn*t country storekeepers, had
no hope of doing either. And that accounts
for some of the before-ment ; oned big differ-
ence between city and country prices. The
credit system finishes the job. Six ard
twelve months’ bills, and some even ra re
ancient, were common with me. Of course,
the money was all right in most cases, but
how under such a system are cheap goods
possible?
LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. J. J. Walsh, Irish Free State Postmaster-
General, enters an, angry protest against British
tobacco manufacturers coming to the Free State of
Ireland to erect factories. Mr. Walsh describes it as
‘this intensive foreign exploitation, which has been
going on for 50 years, lie have succeeded in removing
the foreigner politically,’ he says, ‘but if foreigners
come and grab the fruits, we will have only changed
one slavery for another.’ ” — Cable.
The foreign exploiter is here wid nis ’baccy.
He’s selling it cheaper than ever we could.
No modern requirement he seeems for to lack: he
Can make the shtuff powerful and fragrant and
good.
The building trade’s booming. The tyrant is spend-
ing
A power of money on mortar and bricks.
Will England her infamies never be ending,
Her cash-grabbing wiles and her slave-making
tricks ?
Before the oppressor in arrogance landed,
Ar.d started to offer employment to all,
The most of the natives were pretty well stranded:
They couldn’t raise money in large sums or small.
Now all have their pockets with notes lined each pay
day;
And, though at the time the experience cheers,
Yet grief comes with thoughts of their land in its
heyday,
’Ere ’baccy was known, and their eyes fill wid
tears.
Ah! why won’t they leave us alone to our sorrow?
Why force on us England’s vile culture and cash?
Why hurry us into the smoke of to-morrow
When all that we yearn for is yesterday's ash?
No answer is heard from the English betrayers,
As, heedless of those whom in bondage they’ve
sold —
The bondage of ’baccy—and deaf to our prayers
They ruin old Erin with Sassenach gold.

“Fonoble”: Two A.I.F. battalions, the
41st and the 60th, can boast a distinction
unique among hard-fighting units. They
never lost a single prisoner to the enemy.
“L.W.11.”: Paddy O’Dwyer had for years
been rep. on the Goondoon-Kalewa line
(Bundaberg district), but recently his office
was cancelled. Paddy’s blood boiled, and
he went to find the reason from the district
organiser. This gentleman told him he was
found perfectly trustworthy, etc., but was
“temperamentally unfit” for the job. “Be
dom’d for a yarn!” said Paddy. “How
could you fellies tell me temperature when
I was up at Goondoon!”
“S.T.S.” : There seems to be no doubt that
Ur* on, the distinguished painter, is a little
mad, with that kind of madness to which
great genius is proverbially allied. The
figures in his new Unknown Soldier picture,
wearing helmets and boots and nothing else,
are strong evidence. Much in the same way,
in his local Irish satire, “Sowing New Seed,”
which so strangely found a home in Australia
for a year or two, he mingled comical, over-
dressed figures with the symbolical nude.
“F. Clinton”: The Canucks can show us
points in feeding cattle. A recent shipment
of stud stock from Canada arrived in Sydney
in excellent condition, despite the trying-
trip on a comparatively small vessel. They
had been fed during the voyage on a greyish,
flaked material which turned out to be the
waste from a beet-suaar mill. The stuff: had
been treated to make it a well-balanced
ration, on which stock thrive. The trash or
waste from our cane-sugar mills similarly
treated and “chaffed” would be as good a
stock food, and quite as cheap as oaten
chaff. Yet we cheerfully waste it year
after year—and go on cursing the shortage
of feed in drought time.
“Jackar’s” lesson for primary producers:
For many weeks past Ah Wop has been supplying
us with luscious muscatel grapes so fresh as still to
bear the natural “bloom” and at prices no dearer
than those asked for inferior qualities by the barrow-
men. X asked him where he ’ bought them, and
his reply was: “No buy ’em —me glow ’em. Tlee
years ago my countlymen, alee same partners, buy
’im glape farm; gettem Dago-man boss five pong a
week, plantem all muscatel. This year twenty-fi’
acres—-welly good clop ; next year forty acre ; byem-
by plenty more.” “You sell in wholesale market?”
I asked. “No fear! Allee same partners takem cart,
sell good customer.” “You makem plenty profit?”
“Byem-by welly big plofit! Two my countlymen
go Gosford look big fluit-garden—five thousan’ pong.
Byem-by plenty good fluit-—sellem cheap to customer.
’Osa’ market no good; too muchee expense; too
muchee cheat.”
“Fitzwilliam”: “Macquarie Street’s” para-
graph on the ignorance of schoolteachers
about foreign authors (B. 10/5/’23) reminds
me that the local school inspector came round
to my house the other night for a pipe and
a yarn. He asked me what was the book
in my hand. I told him Sterne’s “Tristram
Shandy.” His comment was, “Sterne? I
. never heard of him. He must be a new
author, isn’t he?” He wasn’t a young in-
spector either. Not that the younger teach-
ers aren’t just as bad sometimes. One sweet
young thing asked me recently who “Les
Miserables” was. She had heard that he
was the hero of a French book, but though
she thought that “Miserables” might possibly
be a French surname, she did not think that
any Frenchman would call his son “Les.”
“Sucre” : Qwong Jang shuttered his eyes
to the light of day at Cairns (N.Q.), and
left the local auctioneer to square up his
earthly accounts. A score of porcelain-faced
compatriots sauntered through the dead
man’s house peering with furtive interest
and subtle speculation at the assortment of
boxes and furniture. “Going for 30 bob!”
yelled the man with the mallet, as he pointed
to the ice-chest. The tap of the hammer
sounded like the first clod of soil as it strikes
the coffin at everybody’s funeral. This time
a white man was the purchaser. He too tapped
the ice-chest with a hammer, and again
came a dull sound. “Dam’ insulation gone!”
he muttered, and proceeded to undress the
freezer. It was “ribbed” with 20 flat tins
full of “the sleep of the gods”—white poppy
opium. The drug of a million dreams was
out of the white man’s line, and the police
took custody of what 20 saffron-skinned seek-
ers had overhauled the house for in vain.
“Percy Pawnticket”: The N. S. Wales
Gwendoline will weigh the pros and cons,
more thoughtfully in future before she under-
takes a schoolmarm’s qualifying course.
Hitherto, when she had won the right to
enter the Teachers’ College at the leaving-
certificate examinations, the State, after ex-
tracting an undertaking that the student
would remain in the service for a term of
years, paid her an allowance of from £5O
to £BO per annum while her education as
an educator was being completed. However,
if Mr. Right came along and the maiden de-
cided to get married,-the Department could
always be relied upon to cancel the agree-
ment, and give the bride a discharge from
her liability as a wedding present. But new
Director of Education S. H. Smith has passed
round the word that the terms of the bond
must be adhered to, and Gwendoline will have
to reimburse the Department for its expense
in training her if she decides to abandon
education for matrimony. The generosity of
the past was doubtless held justified by
public policy, but a hard-up Government no
longer feels like paying away good money
without getting value.
THE TRIUMPH OF STARVATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
•‘ln Russia the workmen now occupy the palaces
and mansions that they originally built for the master
class.”— Jock Garden.
The tyrants and their grandeur both are gone;
Red revolution swept them from these halls;
\nd where the lights on gilded feastings shone
The dimness hides the dirt-stains on the walls
The mansions of the rich the workmen hold,
Wrapped in their rags and shivering in the cold.
Wrapped in their rags, and hungering for food,
Ijcss clean than ever, in each massive room
\ workman sits amidst his crying brood
That whimpers at the shadows and the gloom,
And dreams perhaps, in sleep with nightmares mad,
Of cosy huts where life was sometimes glad.
No more the rich can flaunt before the gaze
Of multitudes, for riches, too, have fled ;
No scene of gluttony the poor dismays:
There is no food for gluttons to be fed.
Bare is the workman’s triumph as these halls
With their wrecked splendor and their muddied walls
N.S.W.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
soft, caressing Sydney nights!
The stars so clear, the sky so near.
It seems a roof above my head.
A curtain, strewn with spangled lights.
Of deepest dark-blue velvet spread.
Across the bay there blows a breeze
That stirs the languorous pepper-trees,
And sets the dry palms whispering there;
Still, warm and soft, it has no sting
To chill the blood, or nip the brain,
Or dull delight. Ah! once again
It comes in little gusts that bring
Fragrance intolerably sweet
That wakens memories, vague and fleet
Of other lives by other seas
Lived long ago—ah! who knows where?
Rhythmic below the waters break
So drowsily, so leisurely,
It cannot surely be the sea,
But rather some enchanted lake,
Lapping to-night against the quay.
The sky is spangle-strewn above,
While beach and headland near and far
Glitter with many a twinkling star.
And gliding as on molten glass
Lazily heaving as they pass,
The ferry steamers come and go
Like flery beetles all aglow.
And as you see the lank seagrass
Waving through depths of crystalline,
Ribbons of gold sway to and fro
In quivering lines, long broken lights—
Ribbons of gold that twist and twine
About my heart, ancl hold my love
So fast they will not let it go,
These soft caressing Sydney nights!

HE seemed to fit and fill the little shop.
Coming in from the sun-soalced
street, I found it hard at first
to pick him out of the general blackness.
Even when the big body did take
on a separate outline, it was as if a
piece of the soft gloom wavered and
fell apart from the rest and floated towards
me. And then, as definition increased, I
felt that a great black spider crept on me
from the blind darkness of some dusty corner.
One mote-speckled shaft of sunlight split the
shadows between us, and, as he passed from
the vagueness beyond to its bright glare, it
seemed for all the world that he suddenly
leapt at me.
I have a certain taste in bookshops.
Big, well-kept shops, shops with lavishly
dressed windows and commissionaires, neat,
orderly, law-abiding shops, interest me not
a bit. I like the little, furtive, apologetic
fellows that seem to spring out on you
suddenly from all sorts of queer corners
and then sink right back on themselves in
confusion at having dared to show them-
selves at all.
This was a shop that warmed my heart.
It was so hopelessly small and shrinking at
first glance, so desperately diffident. And
when it had lured yon to its overloaded
little windows and roughly-made cases that
almost closed the already narrow doorway,
it seemed to whisper hoarse defiance in your
ear of all law and order and logic and
sanity. Arrangement and method were un-
known. Grimm’s Fairy Tales stood close
to a seldom-mentioned book of Defoe’s; old
Cellini rubbed shoulders with Fox’s Martyrs ;
Wordsworth leaned heavily on a bilious-
looking cookery-book. It was the kingdom
of the written word in hopeless revolution.
It was a Bolshevik among bookshops.
And it was in an exactly similar way
that the owner of all this confusion loomed
on my senses, first as a furtive shape lost
in diffident shadows, and then, at close
quarters, as an embodiment of all that was
law-deriding and revolutionary, a close pic-
ture of what you have always dreamed a
Bolshevik would be like if ever you met one.
Further knowledge changed my idea of both
shop and owner; but so it was that they
first struck me.
I spent a thoroughly happy hour browsing
over the heavily-packed shelves. ! There
were books everywhere, of all sizes, ages,
subjects and states of disrepair. There were
books for children and books for wicked old
men ; books on poetry and picture-framing,
on Hell, Heaven and hens; books in bundles
of six at Is. 3d. the lot. and De Maupassant
in 17 volumes at 10 guineas. For a
time I Avas too intent on the astounding
mixture before me to take much note of
the man himself. But later I found my eyes
turning back to him again and again. From
all outward appearance you would not have
been surprised if he had suddenly broken out
into a rash of confluent communism before
your very eyes. He had a massive bony head
that carried a thick mat of black hair. A
straggling black beard barely softened the
hard lines of his heavy jaw. Black bushy
eyebrows and jutting cheek-bones all but hid
his eyes. A short thick neck led to long
thick arms and chest. For, the rest, lie was
untidy, tremendously untidy.
. The first thing that Aveakened the impres-
sion caused by the fierceness of his make-
up avus the Avay he had of fingering the
books. He was broAvsing, too, and he had
a lingering, gentle touch for each volume.
This avus certainly a difficulty. No one could
touch books like that and eA r en start to be a
Bolshevik. And then, as I talked to him, I
looked close into liis deep-set eyes. There
was the calm, reflective quiet in them of
some shaded pool. In later days, for I Avent
back and back to the little shop, I learned that
my Bolshevik Avas something of an artist —a
small distinction, perhaps; also a little of
a poet—a trifling difference this. Of the
fruits of his talent I can sav nothing, for
it was a modestly hidden crop. Never did
I see one A T erse or one. 1 small sketch. But
it was the sane kindliness of the eyes that
put right out. of court my first hasty notion
of the man. Never Avas seeh n
as lay between that bully’s body and the
thoughtful eyes. More and more, as our
acquaintance groAv. I was brought to realise
the wealth of wholesome philosophy that
lay behind them.
We spoke of many things, but, though
“shoes and ship and sealing-wax” might hold
us over some half-hours, we usually swung
back to talk of books. It had been our earliest
and remained our most usual meeting-ground
from that first day when he had answered
my banal question with, “Books, yes, of
course. Who wouldn’t love them?” He
was never extravagant or reckless in speech
(I don’t think he could have been a very
good poet). In fact, he usually seemed a
little tongue-tied or saving of Avords. The
most ardent expression of enthusiasm he
possessed was a hackneyed “Wonderful!”
which he sadly overworked.
“Books,” he said later, “why, they’re Avon-
derful! I don’t see how a man can be quite
unhappy while he has books Avithin reach.”
As a business man he was not a success.
It often seemed to me that with him the
satisfaction of the salesman was very much
off-set by real sorrow at parting Avith good
friends. He always appeared to be more
anxious to buy than to sell. Once or twice,
stumbling on some treasure that I had
missed through many visits, I surprised in
him an astonishing gruffness of manner and
a gleam of surliness in the quiet eyes as I
made the purchase. I remembered that these
particular volumes had each been in some
most unlikely spot, and it seemed plain on
afterthought that more than mere chance
had gone to the hiding of them. If he had
ever started to set apart the books marked
for his special affection, his stock would
have quickly dAvindled to ridiculous mean-
ness. nis tastes Avere wonderfully catholic,
far too much so for any pretence at cul-
ture. He was a long Avay from being dis-
criminating—glutton not gourmet.
But, if this applied to his mental out-
look, it most certainly did, also, to his large
humanity, and here it Avas a happy defect.
The dusty little shop knew many visitors
who came on no business of buying and sell-
ing. He was profligate and quite unreason-
able in the way in which he dealt out great
chunks of sympathy and more solid com-
fort. He made no nice distinct-on between
deserving and undeserving cases, and this
accounted for a good deal of the queerness
of some Avho came to see him. It aiso drew
the very proper condemnation of his near
neighbors. Mrs. Hegarty knew all about it.
Mrs. Hegarty was the lady who owned
the small shop next door. >She Avas very
fat, so much so that each part of her seemed
to be slopping untid.ly over some other part.
Mrs. Hegarty so,d “veg bies” and gave away
gossip, all in the same red-faced, breathless
Avhispers. She had a due sense of the pro-
prieties and a left eye that never 'ceased
from "Avatering,” an unfailing stream of
tears trickling down the fat cheek from the
lashless, dropping, angry lower lid. The
right eye, on the other hand, was uncom-
promisingly stern and bright. And thus it
always seemed that half of Mrs. Hegarty
glared unwinking at the horrid wickedness
of the world, for Avhich the other half wept
continuously.
Mrs. Hegarty told me all about it, hoarse
and scandalised —“nice go.n’s on,” she called
it. She had seen all the ugl.ness of gutterdom
that had found its way to the little book-
shop, a great number of the merely unlucky
but also a sprinkling of roughs, toughs and
rogues of all sorts ; many, anyAvay, that “she
Avouldn’t be seen dead with.” Of course,
there were others—“like y’rself, sir.” But
some of them! Words failed her, and she
lifted fat red hands to Heaven and wept—-
on the left side only.
I often broke in on a strange conference
in the little shop, but my bookseller hid his
good works as jealously as his essays in art,
and my entrance was usually the cue for
an obvious and rather clumsy change of sub-
ject. But there Avere times Avhen a little lift
in drooping shoulders, a little sparkle in
Aveary eyes or speck of color in wan cheeks
showed me something of the way of the man
with these unfortunates. So it was that I
came back and back to. the place long after
I had exhausted its possibilities. There
seemed to be no end to those of the man.
I had thought at first that the shop an-
swered for all of him. He and his books
seemed so entirely complementary as to
leave no room or reason for anything else.
Later it seemed absurdly unreasonable not
to have suspected the domestic side of him
long before I did. It was several weeks before
I even kneAv that there was a family attached
to the bookshop. By that time Ave had defi-
nitely passed the border between acquaint-
ance and friendship, and he spoke freely.
And then it was quickly borne in on me that
this was not one side but the whole of life
to him.
There were a wife and a boy of about
18. The woman was somewhere on holi-
day when I first went there. Afterwards I
suav her often enough, though she was away
for much of her time, and, when at home,
seldom stayed long in the shop itself. She
was some 10 years younger than the man,
full-figured, florid and handsome, though her
face Avas someAvhat marred by the suggestion
of a petulant scoavl. The boy I never saw.
He Avas at Bendigo, “in a bank.” And on
and about these two all life centred for my
friend the bookseller. Books lie loved, but
on Avife and child he lavished a wealth of
tender Avorship that seemed strangely
unworldly. On this one subject words came
easily to him, instances of the unselfish love
of the wife, age-old stories of quaint little
tricks and sayings of the boy in ipfancy.
So many times he spoke of these tAVO, and
his voice softened and his eyes glowed with
tenderness. It was all queer and almost
child-like and rather frightening in a way
coming from the great, hulking, untidy
figure.
One day he told me something of the
Avoman’s former unhappiness. We were
standing in the narrow doorway. From the
extreme edge of the pavement a disreputable
yellow mongrel eyed us in wistful but very
suspicious fashion. It was a statue of abject
misery: thin, lop-eared and dirty. One badly
bruised or broken leg held clear of the
ground, tail well tucked aAV&y, it cringed arid
shivered before us, begging for some k:nd-
ness. but so used to brutality that it shrank
fearfully from any approach.
“Makes you lose faith in humanity a bit,
that,” said my friend, “doesn’t it?” He
held a biscuit in his hand and was trying
to coax the mongrel nearer. But, though

THE only safe and effective method of treating Winter Coughs, Colds & Chills, Sore 1 hroats,
Laryngitis, Bronchitis or other chest complaints, is to take a medicine that goes direct to the root
of the trouble—in throat, bronchial tubes and lungs. PEPS, the true breatheable remedy, do this
Peps owe their unparalleled success to the
ingenious idea of condensing into the form of
a handy tablet, balsamic pine essences and other
volatile medicaments of inestimable value in
troubles affecting throat, chest or lungs.
When a Peps tablet is divested of its silver
wrapper and slowly dissolved on the tongue, the
POWERFUL MEDICINAL FUMES
given off, are breathed deep into the chest and
lungs. Thus the Peps medicine comes into
immediate contact with vital parts quite beyond
the range of liquid medicine. It is a proved
scientific fact that so-called ‘cough cures’ swal-
lowed into the stomach, can never affect the
chest or lungs except in a very slow and round-
about way.
As the Peps medicinal fumes circulate through
all parts of the breathing
system their soothing and
healing influence is
quickly made mani-
fest. Sore, weak
inflamed tissues are
soothed and healed
dangerous disease
in a unique but simple way.
germs are destroyed, and chest and lungs are
gradually but wonderfully strengthened.
Be sure and get these breatheable PEPS
tablets and refuse nauseous mixtures containing
opium, morphia, chloral or other dangerous
drugs. Peps contain no harmful drug, but are
so pure and so safe that they can be given even
to the youngest child Or frailest invalid with
absolute benefit.
Keep Peps always handy! They are the
most valuable remedy ever discovered for treat-
ment of Coughs, Colds, Night Chills, Throat
Trouble, Bronchitis, Bronchial Asthma, Old
Folks’ Cough, Children’s Chest Weakness, etc.
PEPS are obtainable of all Chemists and Stores
at 1/6 per box, or family size 3/- (containing three
times quantity), or post free at same prices I r °pi

name PEPS is stamped on every tablet.
The InfectioM'KiNfng Tablets.
Or. Gordon Stables says
Dr. Gordou Stables, in one of his famous books,
says Peps are exceptionally suited for the
treatment of bronchial ailments ; their peculiar
composition, their direct influence on the mem-
branes of tne bronchi and their freedom from
risky narcotics being among their many praise-
worthy points. Therefore, if you desire to ease
and end a cold or to loosen tickling phlegm and
clear the throat and breathing tubes, use these
Peps tablets freely.”
Serious Chest Complaint.
Mrs. Abbott. Carmalea, Wynnum North,
Brisbane, Q’land, writes :

and at times not able to lie down on account of
the awful choking s*>i sations and wheezing on the
chest. I wish to let y ou know of the wonderful
relief your Peps have r.ven me. When these bad
attacks are on I take two of the Peps, which bring
me quick relief; and a ter continuing fora few
doses at short intervals 1 am soon able to lie down
without the suffocating feelings overtaking me.
“ Anyone I come a.ross who is suffering from
colds, or other chest i rouble. I recommend Peps

relief, which they alr ays' get quickly. .
“ Y )U are quite at liberty to use this testimonial
as you wish, as 1 think others suffering from
Bronchial Asthma, as I have, or any other cnest
trouble, would be pleased to know of Peps. Per-
sonally I would not be withoflt them. ’

its jaws dripped with desire, fear held it
rigidly at a distance.
“Poor little devil!” said the bookseller.
“It hurts to think what it’s been through.”
He tossed a piece of the biscuit close to the
feet of the dog, which darted some yards
away from it and then regarded it fearfully
for a full minute before starting on a
stealthy, three-legged approach, halting every
few inches in pitiful distrust. The man
suddenly turned to me.
“You know,” he said, “women are wonder-
ful.”
I smiled a little at his over-worked adjec-
tive *of all enthusiasm, and he hurried on
apologetically. “Oh, I know I’ve talked
you silly about Gwen and all she’s meant to
me. But I’ve never told you of the hell she
went through before we met. It just struck
me.” And he threw another piece of the
biscuit towards the cowering dog.
“It keeps on surprising me to think what
cruelty there is,” he went on, “and how
much tilth a fine nature can pass through
without being soiled.”
Now, I had heard a deal of this matter from
my good gossip Mrs. Hegarty, so the tale
he started to tell was little new to me. It
seemed that Mrs. Bookman had married be-
fore as a very young girl. The man bad
proved to be a remarkably, whole-hogging
sort of scoundrel, and for five years the girl
w,gs sufficiently unhappy, until the sordid
business ended with the death of the man
in a drunken brawl.
“There seems to have been hardly a decent
instinct in him,” was the verdict of the soft
voice beside me on the dead husband. Mrs.
Hegarty had put it differently but to much
the same effect. She had said huskily: “A
low-down, stinkin’ cow ’e was, alwuz boozed
as a bat!”
The boy who was now “in a bank” was the
product of this union, and had come in for
the whole of the starved father-love natu-
rally stored in such a nature as that of the
big bookseller, Avho now said to me: “I
couldn’t have' felt different, anyhow, if he
had been my own. He always was a won-
derful kid, the whitest, cleanest little chap
you ever saw.”
It must have been three months after this
that I found him one day idle and listless,
sitting far back in a dark corner. He held
an open book and slowly turned its leaves,
but his expression was dazed and unheeding.
Somehow the husky figure seemed to have
shrunk appreciably. At his feet stretched a
nondescript yellow dog whose upturned eyes
waited on his every move. It was the same
pathetic mongrel that had needed a whole
hour of coaxing to overcome its man-made
fear of man. Now it seldom left him. He
talked dully for a while. Then he said:
“Gwen’s packing a few things. I’m going
away for a day or tvvo—to Bendigo. I’ve
just had a letter. It’s here somewhere.” Pie
fumbled in his pockets. “An extraordinary
letter,” he muttered.
The letter was curt and businesslike, com-
pounded of formal regrets and a bald state-
ment that, owing to serious irregularities
in the money handled by the boy, the bank
had been compelled to place the matter in
the hands of the police. He sat there very
still, turning over the unnoticed pages of the
book. His wife called to him from an inner
room the time of the train he was to catch
and some details of clothes that she had
packed. He answered automatically and
mumbled on: “She’s wonderful, Gwen, isn’t
she?... .Extraordinary letter!”
I left him still fumbling blindly at the
book.
It was towards the grey dusk of a cheerless
winter day some months later that Mrs.
Hegarty, left eye leaking copiously, waved
an excited red arm at me from the midst of
her cabbages. I had not visited the little
shop for a few weeks. After the disillusion-
ing trip to the country, my friend the book-
man had drifted back to the old routine.
But there i remained with him some of the
dull pain and world-suspicion that he had
succeeded in wiping out of the eyes of the
disgraceful little mongrel that was forever
at his heels. The uncanny shrunken appear-
ance still lingered about the big body.
Mrs. Hegarty was extra breathless when
I reached her, but she managed to pant in
a hoarse half-shout, “She... .sne’s ’ooked it!”
“Who? What?” I asked stupidly.
“’Er!” gasped Mrs. Hegarty, jerking a
fat thumb across a massive breast in the
direction of the bookshop. “ ’Ooked it, buzzed
off, faded! Y’ could’ve knocked me down
with a Not that I ever ’ad much
time for ’er—too bloomin’ ’aughty an’
sulky-like. Deep, them sort, that’s what I
says, deep! While the ol’ man was away
last night, it was, she ups an’ off with that
there bloke ’Erbert. You remember
’Erbert!”
Yes, I did remember Mr. Herbert, mainly
as a matter of loud voice and clothes that
sometimes marred the disorderly harmony
of the quiet shop. I had also seen him
abroad with Madame Gwen.
“Comes in ’ere last night, with ’er cheeks
as red as one o’ those trollops. Wants me to
give a note to ol’ Wire-whiskers when ’e
gets back. Fed up, she says she was, fed
up o’ books an’ quietness an’ such. Fed
up o’ being well fed an’ looked after, that’s
what she was! So off she goes with a
commercial.” And quite a lot more Mrs.
Hegarty had to say.
An early lamp in the little bookshop
fought with the dying day for the lighting
of the strip of pavement outside. I have
little liking and less capacity for the role
of comforter, but the small yellow patch of
that lamplit window seemed so hopelessly
lonely in a whole world of drizzling dusk
that I forced myself to go on. He was
sitting hunched up in a chair, the dog at
his feet. As he stood up, I saw more marked
than ever in his eyes the hurt, questioning
look of an ill-treated animal and also some-
thing that wiped away all thought of words
of sympathy.
He began to talk rather feverishly of a
book he had bought that dqy. And then he
fell silent and I wandered over to a far
shelf. When I again looked at him he was
idly crumpling the dropped ear of the
mongrel beside him. As he cauglit my eye,
he straightened his slouched shoulders,' and
smiled.
“Wonderful things, dogs,” he said.

A Bush Memory.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IWAS a youth of IS, on my first visit
to Queensland, staying with a brother-
in-law, Robert Muir, owner of Ben-
owa sugar plantation, on Nerang Creek.
Eastward we heard day and night the dull
roar of the Pacific, and southwards towered
the jungle-clad peaks of the Macpherson
Range. There were three Muir brothers,
two of them bachelors and the th.rd a
widower, my sister being dead. The young-
est was David, then a man about 45, and
he and I had to go over to White and
Robinson’s plantation on the Coomera to
bring back two milking cows. On the way
we took a short cut across the bush, skirt-
ing an open fiat with clumps 01 swamp-
oak, and on the opposite side, about 2UO
yards away, we noticed a two-roomed slab
hut roofed with stringy-bark. On a grey
gum-stump, in front of the hut, stood a
little woman weaving some white garment
with great emphasis, so we cantered over
to see what was wrong. She was only a
little woman, but there surely never was a
sunnier, happier, more childlike soul than
hers. Possibly that was an age when even
my sombre sunrises seemed radiant with the
glory of a splendid daw T n. She asked us
to come in and see her baby, and we dis-
mounted and went into a room where every-
thing was clean and white, but not so white
as a frail, tiny infant lying on a little bed,
moaning with those faint and feeble and
pathetic moans that give you one pain across
the forehead and another across the heart.
There was infinite pathos in the mother’s
heroic efforts to avoid causing us pain by a
display of her own grief; she smiled and
laughed hysterically, while large-sized tears
raced down her cheeks on to the bed, the
baby and the floor. And all the time she
\vas telling us how she longed for Jim to
come home; for Jim was a teamster, away
in Brisbane, and knowing nothing of the
baby’s illness or that his little wife was
alone, the nearest neighbor miles away.
She was terribly troubled because she had
nothing to offer us to eat. She had been so
pain-stricken over the baby that, she had
not the heart to make a damper or even do
her washing, which, was all in two big tubs
down at the waterhole, and had been there
for well-nigh a week. When in her despera-
tion she asked us if either of us was a
doctor and knew all about babies we simply
took the count for 10 seconds, and felt mean
enough to turn into goannas and sneak into
holes. Davy, I remember, made some irre-
levant remarks about mysterious remedies
nobody but ho had ever heard of. and about
as accessible in that isolated spot as 40-
year-old champagne.
Then he and I went outside to consult
concerning ways and means. We had to
face a syllogism with three distinct proposi-
tions : The little woman had no bread or
beef. The little woman must be hungry.
There was a lot of washing quite beyond
the little woman’s capacity.
In mv saddle-bag were two wonga-pigeon
shot on the way over. Eismillah; Davy
would make a sour-milk dajnp?r *hile 1
cleaned and roasted the two wongas.. Had
we known as much concerning caUreat
ment of babies as we knew obout d'‘impe .
and wongas the baby would hove beem saved;
That little mother held us both m the
of her hand, and at her reciuest vould
have stopped at nothing short of
Had there been no wongas we would will-
ingly have killed one of the horses and fried
his liver for her and made soup 1S ® lu “ s -
Having roasted the wongas and baked the
damper, we made tea and set out a little
dinner for her under a bough-shed out of
hearing of the mournful wail, of the dyihg
baby. Then-Davy and I niade a start on
the washing, and told the woman to
hunt for everything that could stand water,
that we were laundry experts, and no-
thing that could be thrown into a wash-tub
had a chance to escape us. Davy knew no
more about women’s clothes than lie knew
of the Mausoleum of Artemisia, and the
stern, old, bearded bushman at the tub was
a spectacle for the angels. The little woinaii
paid periodic visits, and had to forget the
sick baby for a few minutes and sit on a
log to laugh. And Davy and I tried to
laugh, too, and shut out the pam in the
eyes of that little woman and the wail of
the dying baby. . .
But at last the washing was finished and
hung on the line, and the little woman had
plenty to eat and plenty of water and fire-
wood, and she cried with gratitude, and said
she would say a prayer for us every night
of her life Then we rode some miles to
the home of Binstead, the timber-getter on
the Coomera, and in half-an-liour one of his
daughters was in the saddle with a big
parcel of things, and she cantered away to
comfort and help the little woman and the
baby. And in half-an-hour she was fol-
lowed by her sister and another Parcel, for
such is the spirit of the bush. hat splen-
did girls those daughters of Binstead, and
what a grhnd couple the old people!
The next afternoon two horsemen were
riding away home, riding away bareheaded
from the slab-and-bark home where a little
woman was sitting in the agony of her griet
by the cot of her dead first baby, with Bin-
stead’s noble daughter beside her sharing the
tears and sorrow. ..
At the edge of the clearing we turned our
horses for a last look. We saw the washing
still on the line, and we thought of Davy s
sour-milk damper, baked in a camp-oven—
the best bread in the world —and the two
roast wongas. and the little woman’s mingled
tears and laughter, and finally that last
scene with the two weeping women and the
dead baby; and we covered our heads once
more and rode home in silence, for neither
could speak to the other for the pain at
our hearts.
In after years, long after, the husband
told me his wife, up to the day she died,
included in her prayers that "God bless
the two men who helped me when my baby
was dying.” And Davy and I valued that
above all other memories.

TO EAT WELL,
SLEEP WELL,
and WORK WELL
Take
Bcccbams pills
i
YOU WILL BAT WELL
Because, by their specific action on the Digestive Organs,
Beecham’s Pills remove the sensation of fulness and op-
pression commonly experienced, give the appetite “edge”
and restore the Stomach to healthy natural function.
YOU WILL SLEEP WELL
Because Beecham’s Pills gently calm irritation of the
Nervous System, while by their stimulative and cleansing
action upon the Liver and Kidneys, digestion proceeds
with normal regularity so that at night the tranquillized
mind and body are prepared for “ Nature’s sweet restorer”
—peaceful slumber. Should one feel restless after an
exciting or convivial evening, a dose of Beecham’s Pills
will quickly induce refreshing sleep.
YOU WILL WORK WELL
Because Beecham's Pills bring about the proper assimila-
tion of the food taken, give tone to the Stomach, purify
the Blood, invigorate the Nervous system, add force to the
muscles, and thus endue the worker —mental or physical
—with renewed energy and power.
Sold everywhere in boxes, labelled 10|d 1/1 2/9 (original English prices)
