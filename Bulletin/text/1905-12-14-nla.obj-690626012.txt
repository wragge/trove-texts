NURSE JANE'S DISEASES
THE yarn I wish to spin to-day
Concerns a City by a Bay—
Or Harbour, if you say so :
Where Love upset an Apple-Cart
That would have pleased the kindly Heart
Of P. Ovidius Naso.
Australia hears the Clarion call
To Pills ! My City’s Hospital
Made every Caller keener ;
And what is strange, about this time,
It was no architectural Crime,
But just a Misdemeanour.
This lordly Hospital was planlie I
To help the Sick throughout the Land
To Hygiene or Hearses :
Its Doctors were a Corps d’Elite,
Its Roman Matron owned the Street
And five-and-sixty Nurses.
Napoleon’s Soldiers, though in Rags,
Had Marshals’ Batons in their Bags ;
And ’neath a N urse’s Bonnet
You read the Text that rules her Life :
“I too may be a Doctor's Wife!
The Darlings, how they con it !
But, as the Mischief had it here,
Ten Hero-Souls sans Hope or Fear
Prescribed or operated :
For one was “ Such a lovely Duck !
That every Heart, with Darts bestuck,
To view him palpitated.
Now Nurses differ, as you know,
For some are built for Use, not Show ;
And Sixty-Four, though mostly
They guessed their Chances rather slight,
Were sure the Sixty-Fifth could sight
No Chance, however ghostly.
Her Name was Jane, plebeian Jane ;
Her Features matched it—O, so plain !
I fear her Teeth protruded ;
And then her Eyes turned several ways :
No Man in both at once could gaze
With Love, they all concluded.
Alas ! that Men prefer mere Looks
To solid Virtue (say a Cook’s)
That seems a trifle coarse-faced :
This Problem always will perplex
The thinking Members of the Sex,
Especially the Horse-Faced.
Now, Venus, aid me to suggest
Nurse Audrey’s Beauties—Lips confest
For boughs that Cherries grow on ;
And Cheeks ! and Eyes ! fit subjects these
For horticultural Similes ; '
Et Csetera, and so on.
The five-and-sixty Nurses well
And oft debated who was Belle,
And gave the Palm to Audrey :
Compared with her Felise was mean,
And Clara was a rustic Quean,
While Jane was simply tawdry.
But while they ogled, blushed, or sighed
And played the r6le “ If I were Bride ! ”
That maiden Fancy pleases,
Jane suddenly developed Charms
That threw the Prize into her Arms :
She got two strange Diseases !
In Simon’s Posture, Rasch’s Sign,
Congenital in Adam’s Line,
Suggested Diagnosis;
Yet how establish that, in face
Of all the Features of the Case,
Or prove Anastomosis ?
Doctors are Men, we may opine,
(That is, if they are masculine)
Not adamant to Beauty ;
Yet “ the Profession ” holds them fast,
And Love’s a sweet Distraction cast
Across the path of Duty.
Our handsome Hero sundry Links
Had forged with furtive .Nods and Winks
And surreptitious Squeezes :
He wavered : Audrey might have won
Had Jane not crossed the Rubicon
With seven more Diseases !
What Doctor could resist the Chance?
He saw, he seized the True Romance <*
That every Hero seizes :
He brought the Parson to the Bed —
His Friends declared, “ He’s wed! He’s dead !
Of nine obscure Diseases.”
THE EJjTD ?
“ The End ” is not with Marriage sure,
, For Jane became a perfect Cure,
And then her joy was shattered :
As one by one she lost her Dower,
Her fondest Glances in a Shower
Of Love in vain were scattered.
THE SEQUEL !
The Doctor drew a horse in Tatt.’s,
And soon eloped with Audrey. That’s
The Sequel. I abhor it.
“ O, shocking ! ” said the Nurses all,
And then with Pleasure went to call
And see “ how dear Jane bore it.”
THE MORAL?
Long I have pondered this with Pain :
Is it in Audrey ? or in Jane ?
Or in the Mob of Nurses?
When next you see one swooping slow
Just ask her where her Morals grow,
And mention, please, these Verses.
BILL'S IDEES
ON POULTRY.
“ -IVTO,” said Bill, “I don’t keep fowls
{now. Takes too much
*" time. That’s my idee. Why,
when I was out at Marrickville, I never used
to get done before ten o’clock of a night.
Feedin’. An’ waterin’. An’ cleanin’ up the
cages. You ’re always at it.
“I never had a minute to spare. All
Sunday the same. No chance to do a bit of
readin’. Could n’t improve my mind. And
the worry of watchin’ ’em ! Half the
population of, Sydney is chicken-stealers.
That’s my idee.
‘ ‘ Rocks I kept. Plymouth Rocks. Best
ever known in Australia. I had ’em white,
an’ buff, an’ barred. Got me first birds from
a chap in ’Frisco ; an’ all the years I had
’em I never was beaten. Not a
show. Swept the board every time.
“That’s gettin’ on thirty year ago now.
Just after we was married. Had n’t settled
down proper. Had n’t got no sense. Did n’t
know I had a instink worth cul-
tivatin’! That’s why I used to cultivate
fowls.
“ I used to keep ’em under the house at
the back. One of those cottages built on
piles. You know. An’ dark-feed ’em. Had
the place all boarded up. Just enough
light to let ’em pick up the food. That’s
the way to make fowls grow.
“An’ they did grow! My oath! My
best pair went thirty-two pound between
’em. Champion bars. That’s straight.
No kid. The cock weighed eighteen
pound an’ two ounces. You never saw such
a bird. Blow me, he looked near as big as a
emu. An’ every point perfect. Comb a
little big, if anything, an’ neck just a trifle
long ; but not one judge in fifty would notice
it. Not that there is one judge in
fifty. I never saw the man to judge Rocks
yet. Not to please me. Although they give
me the prizes. They had to. But it takes
more than givin’ a prize to make a judge.
You want the instink. That’s my idee.
“ All itiy birds were good. If I hatched a
weedy one the missus popped him in the
pot. He was good that way too. As I say,
I had the best blood, an’ I looked after ’em
like babies. Better than babies. There’s
precious few babies have the attention my
birds had when I was gettin’ ’em ready for
show.
“People came from all over Australia to
look at ’em. But I was mighty careful who
I showed in. Why, bless you ! some of the
blokes as calls themselves fanciers would
think no more o’ stiffenin’ a better bird than
their own than they would o’ puttin’ down a
shandy. Five times my place was broken
into during the three years I was breedin’ !
Twice they ran away with birds. I tracked
the blokes up, thbugh ; an’ one of ’em got
three months. He ought to ha’ got ten
years, the !
“I never sold birds. Only the eggs.
An’ the birds they raised never give me any
trouble in beating. You see, I’d made a
study of Rocks. The blokes who bought the
eggs didn’t know enough. Couldn’t make
the best of them. Fowls have instinks same
as men, an’ you must cultivate ’em. Teach
’em to take pride in themselves. That’s my
idee.
“ Once my birds had been shown they got
the hang of it. They used to train for the
next show just like a bloke training for a
foot-race. My Number One Champion used
to weigh himself against two of the young
birds every morning ; an’ if he felt himself
goin’ off, he’d peck a bit extra to make it
right. O’ course I give him the points. I
rigged up a kind of see-saw scale, an’ showed
him how to get on one end, an’ steady him-
self against two little birds at the other end.
He only wanted once showing. Intelligent ?
My oath !
“ I had two old champions for trainers, to
teach the young birds. There was n’t much
they did n’t know in the way of gettin’ birds
ready for show. An’ the pride they used to
take in it! An’ anxiety ! Why, day before
a show, I’ve seen those birds stand round
my Number One and his hen all day,
polishin’ ’em with their wings till they shone.
They did shine too. The other blokes
could n’t tell how I managed it, an’ you bet
I did n’t tell them. That’s the best way to
shine the plumage : train another bird to
polish it, feather by feather. You take my
tip. If you go in for poultry, you try it.
Cultivate your birds’ instinks. They ’re
good natchrally. Give ’em a chance.
J*
“Why, I used to stick up the show con-
ditions in the yard, an’ vou’d see those old
birds studyin’ ’em as if the/ could read print;,
same as you and me. Tnen they’d go away
an’ look at the champion, an’ talk him over,
an’ maybe alter his diet. Little bit less
greenstuff, or a little more water in the
morning—whatever they thought right. Do
I believe they could read ? Well, you must
think me a fool. But I tell you what
Ido believe. They knoo my voice. I used
to read the conditions over to ’em every
night, an’ I believe they got to know the
way the clauses went. They saw me get it
off the paper, always the same way; an’ in
their heads they put it down again on the
paper, always the same way. Then they
could go up an’ refresh their memory. That’s
my idee.
“ In the end I used to leave all thefeedin’
to the trainers. They knew what was
wanted, an’ they knew how to get it better
than I did. Why, when we was cornin’ near
time, an’ the show birds p’r’aps commenced
to play up a bit—feel their oats, you know—
I’ve seen ’em knock a bird down an’ sit on
his head when he tried to gobble more than
the allowance they give him. Not to hurt
him, you know. Just enough to show him
he must obey the rules.
“ An’ show-day ! Talk about excitement
You could feel it for a week before. How
did they know ? I told ’em, of course ; an’
they used to reckon up the days, just the
same as you or me would. It was as much
as the missus could do to quiet ’em while we
was away, an’ when the show was over, an’
we come back with the prize tickets, you
should have heard the rumpus ! Like
Rand, wick on Cup day. Them was times.
My oath!
Jt
“A great old chap was Governor then.
He was regular gone on fowls, an’ if he’s
been in my yard once he’s been in fifty
times, an’ me in Iris. Though I didn’t think
much of liis birds. He always wanted to
buy some of mine, an’ I never would sell
’em, and sometimes he went away quite
mad. But he always used to ask me to
come up, an’ I’d go up to his place every
month ,or so, an’ give him my opinion. He
did n’t put on a bit of side.
“There was one young cock I had he’d
set his heart on. He was a pretty bird—
not big, but real blood. I did n’t fancy him so
much myself ; but the Gov. was just red-hot
to get him. Went as high as twenty quid ;
but I would n’t sell. I was gettin’ a guinea
apiece for eggs, and did n’t want his money.
Poor old chap ! I give him three pair when
I sold off.
“ One night I’d locked up and gone to bed
about half-past ten. It was a bit after the
big show, so I was sleepin’ upstairs with the
missus. Before, for a good month, I used
to doss under the 1 louse on top o’ the coops,
an’ felt none too safe then. An’ even when I
slept upstairs I always had a tell-tale. You
know. A basin on a chair by the bed, with
a marble hung over it by a bit of cotton that
led right down to the door of the fowl-yard.
“Well, this night I was woke up out of
a dead sleep, an’ there’s the marble tinkling
in the basin. I was wide in a moment: so I
slips on my pants, tak'es the gun, and
down I goes. Opens the kitchen door softly;
steps out ; an’—bang ! —over goes the can
that the girl used to set ready for the milk
when she was n’t up in time. How I blessed
her !
‘ ‘ The bloke was out from under the house
in a moment—too quick for me to stop him ;
but he couldn’t open the gate. He hadn’t
had the savee to wedge it open, an’ it closed
with a spring you could n’t find in the dark
unless you knew just where to put your finger.
‘ ‘ He was a bit slow gettin’ over the fence,
an’ there I had him. Just when he’s nicely
doubled up, with his head outside an’
his legs in, I gives him the full charge-
right behind. Lord ! did n’t he squeal! But
he managed to wriggle over all the same, an’
off round the corner like winking. He had
a cab there, by the sound of the wheels, an’
I did n’t bother chasin’ him.
“Next morning I looks at the fence. It
was an old gun, an’ the shot had scattered
real well, an’ I could see the iron was regu-
larly peppered round a bare place exactly
the shape of a pair of good-sized pants
hung out to dry. I put it in the papers, an’
there was no more thieves for a good bit,
‘ l l went up to tell the Governor about it,
but they would n’t let me see him. Poor old
chap!—he wasn’t too strong, an’ he was
very sick just about that time. Laid up in
bed for a fortnight. ‘ Bad attack of influ-
enza, ’ The Herald said it was.
“Nasty thing, this influenza,” said Bill,
waggling his head with a wise air.

How to A ddress Letters.
Coj i espondents to The Bulletin would oblige the paper
(ana, to an extent, themselves) by taking some car;, „ ;
methods of address. ' e as to
metdt'ebc f itJl fegard to subscriptions, advertise-
bvf ’ -j should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
,-fO the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for "copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

A Song of the Millennium.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the flunkeys cease from flunking,
and the crawlers crawl no more—
When the lackeys’ spines grow stiffer,
the millennium will roar ;
It will clatter in the distance —it will thunder up
the stairs
When the fools cease genuflecting, and the snobs
leave off their airs !
When we’re free of small, cheap titles, and the
gauds are swept away,
The millennium will rattle o’er the pavement in a
dray 1
When we sell our dukes and dukelings, when we
hail the Men who Work,
The millennium will happen with an instantaneous
jerk.
Bat till then we wait it vainly, stretching ear and
straining eye—
The millennium still shuns us, and the Mean
Things cringe and cry 1
When the wasters quit their wasting, and the
bounders bound no more,
The millennium will clamor like Jehannum at the
door.
When the cad becomes good-mannered, and the
“gent ’’ becomes extinct,
Lo ! the bright millennial garlands to the planets
shall be linked.
When the “bookie” boors are banished, and the
usurers are dead,
We shall see the pink auroras dancing polkas
overhead.
When the waiter is transmuted into something
like a Man,
The millennium will caper like a show-horse in a
van.
To the sound of gladsome music we shall gambol
down the years ;
But just now Utopia’s hidden, and beyond the
Stars it jeers.
Aye, when brains are more than boodle our
Atlantis will arrive;
It will ride the great sea-serpent through the
city’s teeming hive ;
When the man of genius prospers, and the poet’s
rent is paid,
The millennium will come prancing with a splendid
cavalcade !
When the virtuous may remain so, and exist in
comfort still,
Prester John shall show his banners on the crest
of yonder hill !
When a bird may preen its plumage, undisturbed
by stone or gun,
Lo ! the gods will straightway volley gifts and
blessings by the ton !
When a flower may bloom ungathered—human
blossoms with the rest —
Then the glow of unknown glories shall light up
z the spacious West !
When a woman’s fame is sacred in the eyes of
every man,
The Chimera will confront us, striped with blue
and black and tan !
When the wanton world remembers that sweet
Love should rule supreme,
We shall get the final bearings of Alnaschar’s
precious dream !
When we help a sister upward, and prevent her
sinking down,
Nick will slam the gates of Tophet with a melan-
choly frown.
When our love of Right is real, and we’re bogus
saints no more,
We shall see the Flying Dutchman as we stand
upon the shore !
When the things I’ve named have happened, the
millennium will whizz :
But it’s not in sight at present, and I don’t know
where it is !

THE JADOO-MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE wuz a Hindoo bloke with big eyes.
’Ad a ’awker’s ticket. Eamo, we called
him. ’E made our station his head-
quarters. ’E sold cottons, silks, concertinas,
mouth-organs an’ moleskins ; anythin’ bar earth-
quakes and Bibles. If ye’d ordered a belfry an’ a
pulpit he’d a-taken the order an’ sent ’em along.
’E sold us two dozen concertinas. My word,
them shearer blokes can play ’Ome, Sweet ’Ome—
mostly kerosene tins when they wuz there—an’
when the two dozen wuz goin’ together it turned
itself into cow-music an’ about six fights.
Muldoon’s station’s a ’ot place; so’s the Castle-
reagh. It’s a place where ye can blow yer name
on yer own thirst before breakfast.
Muldoon’s wuz thirty miles from a pub. Some
of the coves wud give yer a tray-bit ter talk about
beer. A bloke what could sit down and state
what ’e knoo about liquor and froth cud make a
stiddy income.
The brilin’ sun was ’nuff ter give a bloke swine
fever. Fellers used to get rattled about the solar
system. A red-headed shearer got up in his shirt,
one night, and said the sun was keepin’ capital
out of the country.
Ramo, the Hindoo, uster come in an’ sooth us a
bit; he said we’d get icebergs next week if we
left off swearin’. Then he arst how we’d like to
see a real city hotel bar, one with a brass rail
round an’ silver water-jugs ter stick yer elbows in.
I tell yer, Ramo had a crowd round him in
short order. Mie’o the Dawg fell down because
he couldn’t hang on to the Hindoo’s breath. Ramo
was dressed for the oracles; noo red gown with
female trimmin’s, an’ braided an’ sploshed all
over his hair an’ chest.
He perlitely arst us to accompany him to the
shepherd’s hut, by the crik. Micko the Dawg
put on his best clothes an’ struggled fer a place
near the hawker. Nine of us follered Ramo to
the hut. The sun wuz ’nuff ter blind an’ roast
yer. “Ramo,” sez Billy Hayes, “if yer can show
us a beer in the next ’undred acres I’ll let yous
into my raffle for nix.”
“Kimbrick, kydonnezer,” says the Hindoo.
“But the man who rush the drink without per-
mission die quick, jilda. The beer in the per-
formance I show is sacred,” he says.
The shepherd’s hut wuz empty, barrin’ the
insects. Some of ’em could ’ave carried Bst. in
the Melbourne Cup an’ licked Carbine.
The Hindoo put on dog an’ pomp afore he’d
enter the hut. He coughed an’ requested us to
stop swearin’. Then he waved his hands, an’ said
l)e wuz our brother an’ a fellow-beer-eater, an’ a
British subject. It seemed a lot cooler arter he
stopped wavin’ his hands. Nobody spoke. He
held up his fingers an’ went into the hut on his
lonely. He stayed in six minutes. When he
came out his black eyes wuz shinih’.
Micko the Dawg wus first in. ’E stopped dead
in the doorway, ’sif somethin’ sudden had got hold
of his thirst.
“Shillin’ each, to go in,” says Ramo, quietly,
“No fuss, gentlemen. No shillin’, no view.”
Micko the Dawg staggered out. “ Where’s me
money?” he sez, ’uskily. “Where’s me savin’s?”
Eight of us went in. There wusn’t anythin’
like it in the Hotel Australia. It wus a mahogany
bar backed with big lookin’ glasses. On the
shelves wus pyramids of lemons an’ lump sugar.
Piled on top wus seven casks of wine, an’ some of
’em wus drippin’ red outer the silver taps. The
brandy wus labelled in gallon decanters. An’ the
wine had Shatoo this an' Shatoo that painted
across it, with the year ’twas made underneath.
Yous on’y begun to see things arter yous rubbed
yer eyes.
There wus eight long whisky-squashes on the
counter, an’ outer the big wine cask walks a
young lady barmaid bright as life, an’ with finger-
nails on her like pearls.
Micko the Dawg rushes in with his savin’s in
his hand. “ All the whisky-squash in sight, Mr.
Ramo,” he sez. “ Don’t disappoint me. I’ve got
the best thirst this summer.”
“I cannot let you touch anythin’ under five
shillin’,” says the Hindoo. “It has cost me much
money to fit up this bar. ”
Micko lent us five bob each ; we passed it to the
Hindoo. Then he held up his hands an’ started
singing’. “Do not touch the drink until I have
finished,” he says. An’ the lady barmaid nodded
an’ smiled, an’ we started chippin’ about the
weather until the lot of us wus fair gone on her.
Two fellers proposed to her right there.
“What about the whisky-squashes?” says
Micko the Dawg, perlitely.
“Yes,” says the boys. “Ramo has stopped
singing’.”
Micko put out his hand to imbibe, an’ he fell
across the floor* “Who shifted the bar?” he
says, lookin’ at us. “ Who shifted it when I put
out me hand ? ”
Three of us made a blackguard rush at the
wine casks, but they stood off like barrels in a
dream. Then the whisky decanters started to
melt. The barmaid took her beautiful smile farther
back, an’ when we arst her not to go she walked
right into the middle of nothin’ an’ nowhere.
Just as the last barrel of wine wuz floatin
through the hut wall Micko rushed it, but the
wall hit him a woodener an’ laid him out.
Micko said/af ter ward s that the bar was only an
Indian jad<ro fake. Nothin’ was real about it
’cept the hard cash we’d passed to Ramo.
We started lookin’ fer Ramo with stirrup-irons.
but he had the scent of a dingo, an’ he wasn’t
talcin’ any iron in his eonstitooshun. He wuz
light an’ airy for a black man. Yer couldn’t have
found him in a half-acre paddick.
We heard of him down the river at Woolombi
station—Feeney’s place. He put up at the home-
stead—no shearer’s hut for him. Old Feeney an’
his daughter Judy liked Hindoos—they alwis
called ’em Orientals. The Oriental bit Feeney’s
ear for £2OO. We got the office soon after.
Ramo’s game is o’ny in its infancy, but it
knocks spielin’ endways.
Second mornin’ after Ramo’s arri val the
station blokes was surprised to see him an’
old Feeney ridin’ together miles beyond the
bound’ry-fence.
The Hindoo had 500 head of cattle pas-
turin’ on the downs between Barker’s gully
an’ Bloodwood Point. Five hundred Queens-
land fats. Make yer mouth water ter see
’em standin’ belly-deep in feed.
“ Howly mother ! ” sez Feeney, standin’
in his stirrups. “Where in Galilee did
ye obtain this mob, Mr. Ram ? Are ye
honest wut me ? Sure I read the stock
notices an’ divil a hint did I see av the
crowd ye hov here.”
“ Rynozzer sirgarnio,’’ sez the Hindoo.
“My word is pure, oh my lonelyoh.”
“ ’Tis funny seein’ thim sthand there
widout dhrover or dogs,” says Feeney, ridin’
round.
“ The drovers are camped in the bush be-
yond,” sez Ramo. And he made Feeney
look where the smoke of a camp fire was liftin’
through the trees. “The cattle are well fed,
an’ they will not wander,” he sez.
Then he showed squatter Feeney his Queensland
receipts for the mob—brands, stock-agents, auc-
tioneers ; all complete. Feeney licked his lips. If
ye’d a showed him a paddick full of opera chorus-
girls he’d a cursed ye for yer trouble, but he'd ride
50 miles to watch a thousand hoofs an’ horns cross
the river. The sight of the Hindoo’s fats stayed
like water in his mouth. An’, my word, they wus
beauties; every one of ’em fit to steal the ribbon
from the Sydney show.
Ramo said that £2OO was the dirt price of ’em.
Feeney fell off his horse with a shriek of amaze-
ment an’ filled in a cheque on his knee. An’ he
held it in the air till he got the Hindoo’s receipt.
Then Ramo asked Feeney to wait a few minutes
while he settled a few details with the drover.
Feeney waited, but he wus in a fever to get the
mob inside the homestead paddick. It seemed to
get dark all of a sudden, an’ his old eyes couldn’t
foller the Hindoo as he rode off.
Then he thought he’d round up the mob himself
an’ run ’em home. He rode acrost the flat, shadin’
his eyes. “ Fats from the hand iv the Lord,” he
sez. Then his jaw dropped, an’ he sat gibberin’ in
the saddle like an old baboon. The mob of
Queensland fats wuz meltin’ before his eyes. A
shadder came over ’em ; they simply skedaddled
inter the sunset.
If the Hindoo was a squatter from Jadoo, Feeney
was a blackguard an’ convict by birth. Mile on
mile he rode into the dry heat an’ the everlastin’.
An’ the crows follered, pokin’ borak an’ soolin’
him on. Three days after they found him on foot,
shoutin’ an’ wavin’ his arms at the sky. They
said he bit through the neck of his horse. That
happened ten years ago. Every year, in the same
month, he rides to the Devil’s Camping Ground
an’ waits in the mulga for the Hindoo’s mob to come
by.
Next time ye’re on a dry track an’ ye meets a
black hawker, tie him up to a tree an’ make him
jadoo the wilderness into a grass-flat full of cows
an’ cheeses an’ beer. Don’t let him sell yous any
barmaids; yous couldn’t warm your heart at a
paddick full of ’em.”
ALBERT DORRINGTON.
“ H.Gr.”: In ’B6, I saw a curious sight on
the Bogan (N.S.W.). A waggon, with eight
horses, belonging to squatter Allison, of Cannon-
bar, was proceeding to Box Cowal station with six
tons of chaff, after a heavy fall of rain. The road
for some half-mile was covered with water. The
driver, sitting on the load, saw the waggon cutting
in pretty deep, and he halted his team for a
spell. This proved his undoing ; when he wanted
to start again, he found the waggon was down to
the bed in the mud, and the horses were flounder-
ing and fast sinking. Realising that he had got on
top of something bottomless, he quickly freed the
horses, and all but the off-side shatter managed to
get out; the odd one was smothered. The driver
returned to Nyngan for assistance, and I, with
others, went out with, in all, 30 horses. When
we arrived, three hours after the waggon had first
struck, we found only about 2ft. of the load in
sight, though the water was only 18in. deep.. At
150yds. ahead the ground was comparatively
sound, and, with the aid of 36 horses and 32 bul-
locks, the leaders of which were half a furlong
from the waggon, the load was recovered. Since
that time the route has been altered, to avoid that
particular spot. A few of the old carriers believe
that Danny Maguire, who, with his team of 10
horses and waggon, mysteriously disappeared in
the ’7o’s, found a grave for self and complete
plant in the same boghole.
“5.G.8.” writes about the things which
are occasionally found in dead men’s pockets :
Rather a curious thing. In the coat pocket of a
Sydney wharf laborer who was killed a while ago was
found a card with “Prepare to meet thy God” on it in
big letters. Card was quite clean and had evidently been
in the pocket only a day or so.
A fellow told me he was tramping out back, stony-
broke. At the end of a long day he saw a hut just off the
track, and being dead tired, decided to turn in there for
the night. Threw his swaar down in a corner of the first
room and went to sleep without asking questions. In the
morning he thought he noticed some unusual influence in
the air, and went into the next room to investigate. He
found a Chow (dead some time) hanging by the neck from
the roof. Being a man of business instincts, he searched
the pockets and discovered twenty sovereigns done up in
a rag. For all he knows, the Chow may be hanging there
yet. That was a better find than the card.
Some people are very thoughtless, and hang themselves
without leaving any remuneration for the finder of the
bodv. In this respect the Chow set an example that
more progressive races might take to heart. Nothing is
more dispiriting than an unrewarded search in the
pockets of remains.


The Song of the Stampers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THUD-A-THUD! thud-a-thud ! Thro’ the
darkness ramping,
With the smoke-stacks foaming, coughing wlntely
to the sky,
Clangs the pounding battery—god-like feet a-
tramping,
Girt with rolling thunder, down a black Eternity.
Roaring, roaring, roaring
At the clamorous outpouring
Of tho anthem ; fearful echoes cry across the
looming height.
Fair the engine-lights are flaring
Down the blackness, bloodshot, staring ;
While the stampers thud their glory for ever
down the night.
God the Lord has swinging stars, suns that trail
and travel,
Climbing all Eternity, winding ’thwart his knees ;
Man, with shadows at his heart, groping to
unravel
Fate, whose web hath hound him in her cruel
coquetries.
They have blinding treasure
Of the Lord’s best, for her pleasure ;
All the purple, drowsy midnight for her passion
and delight;
And the water-shadows glisten
From the black dam, as they listen
To the lullaby tumultuous flooding o’er them in
the night.
Down and up, and down again—hear the stampers
crying,
Clanging on the hungry plates with a wrenching
thrust;
Spitefully the steam-spray breaks, leaping out and
dying,
Deafening go the iron feet treading dust to dust.
Crashing dire disaster,
Beats the thunder fast and faster,
To the yellow fires —goading all the rods with feat
and fright;
Oh, the world is full of glory
When the battery sings her story,
When she sings her roaring anthem in the over-
hanging night!
Sweat along the driving-rods, sliding hot, and
thrumming
To the myriad voices in the boiler liell astir.
When the leaping heat aflush sets the rafters
humming,
Striving all and straining all for the love of her.
Rattle, roar, and rushing—
Sway the stampers, clanging, crushing,
To the tremble of the boiler, and the furnace
flaming white.
Oh, the blind earth turns her throbbing
From the battery’s wild sobbing,
All her passion, all her travail to the dim discord-
ant night.
Spirits in tiie grotto-ways—dewy, deep recesses—
Wliisp’rers in the musk-helt where the shadows
thickest throng,
Haunters, creaking softly thro’ the dog-wood
wildernesses,
List her, dumbly pitying, for the sorrow of the
song,
"Onward, downward ever”—
(Hear the stanchions shake and shiver)
“ Lo, man the marvel-maker, works so far his Will
a-right.
While his eye our way is guiding,
Fate is down his heart-strings riding.
Dust to dust, and darkness ever!” roar the
stampers on the night.
Thud-a-thud! Thud-a-thud! "Life is hut a
glowing
Winking in the haze, ere the dark stoops down to
bind.
Man, who steers our ploughing rods ’’ (list the
fires going !)
"Creeping with a rushlight faint flickering in the
wind.”
And the warm valves, purring,
Take the tale up, sweating, whirring—
Yet, who knows the pathway since th’ Eternal
hides its light?
Swift, a Hand the pale flare dashes ;
They are worms and drifting ashes—
“ Dust to dust, and outer darkness! ” roars the
battery down the night.
"Still along the trackless deep” (bleat the rods,
unkindly),
" I nil of little faith he goes, selfish in his day.
He that knows this soul of ours treads his own
gloom blindly,
Clouds about his peering head looming every way ;
Sorrow, shame, and sinning
From the ultimate beginning ;
\ et mayhap beyond the cypress there shall be a
fair respite,
Where the old gods, purple-tented,
Dream the golden days and splendid,
Dust to dust, and where the sunshine ?” roars the
battery down the night.
Thud-a-thud ! thud-a-thud ! Murmuring in the
boiler,
M here the wildwood sprites, fire-loosened, faintly
roar.
Hear the plunging stampers’din—"Spoils unto
the spoiler!
Life into the breast of Death for ever, evermore !
Death, and what above us,
If the high gods cease to love us !
Lo, the grey dove wrenches vainly in the talons of
the kite! ”
And the echoes, full of thunder,
Deal the stars the dirge of wonder—
Dust to dust, the high gods keep you ! ” roars
the battery down the night.
Baffled winds about her stacks, roaming nigh, and
whining
From the lustrous gates of God, where the houris
swing;
Star shafts on the purple deeps, in the waters
shining,
Sweetness in the soft air from the bosom of the
Spring.
Clouds of incense lifting,
And the water shadows shifting
When the West wind from the hillside stirs the
ripple in its flight;
And above the Springtide glamor,
Clangs the plunging stampers’ clamor
In the face of the Almighty far up above the
night.
Curlews in the fern-brake raise their mocking
laughters,
Naiads in the black pools turn with murmurous
splash ;
Imps about the creaking roof rustle thro’ the
rafters—
“ Dust to dust and where the dawn?’’hear the
battery crash.
Hear the voices chatter
In the boiler, and tho clntti r
Of the stanchions straining, as tho dumb attain
grips them tight.
Oh, the furnace fires are flaring,
And the headlights, bloodshot, staring !
Oh, the thunder of tho battery roaring, roaring
down the night!

A tear , a sigh, the while he’s riding

WILL JABBATT.
The Stone of Endurance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
T<|HE Dutch lieutenant pointed with his
cigar.
“There it is!” he said. “They say
the poor wretch was a countryman of yours ; but
one of the inscriptions, as you m*. is in French ;
and, if the other is English, it's English that beats
me.” . ,
We were in the ancient Kraton —the royal en-
closure —of Gedday, thick with massive relics of
the strange old Javani civilisation ; but I had no
eyes for anything but this fathom-long slab of
stone, beneath the vast verengen-tree that had
long ago looked down upon an unsung miracle of
endurance—or pig-headedness. For, down the
middle of this yard-wide slab, runs a hollow, worn
into the hard, black stone by the long-continued
friction of a human body, and from one end hang
yet—now rusted to mere filaments—a few links of
the chain at the other end of which, for 12 un-
imaginable years, a white man suffered, sooner
than bow the knee to a yellow one. For the
yellow man, as Sultan of Matarram, had all the
power of an untrammelled despot, and the white
man, as a shipwrecked stranger, had nothing but
his heart of steel.
For a moment I pored over the inscribed words
—rudely cut, but legible enough. “ Yes,” I said,
he was an Englishman—or, at any rate, a Briton,
but his spelling is an erratic version of an anti-
quated style. See here.” and I transcribed into
my note book the words—minus the personal aber-
rations—“ you can make that out, can’t you ?”
“Nine twelvemonths here, nowe; ande wolde
be a centurie thereof, before thatte I wolde doe
reverence untoe this proude Paynim dogge.”
“Much the same as he has cut in French,’’ Van
Boog said when he had hammered out the import
of these grimly pathetic words. “ And ho was
three years here after that! Tough follows, you
Englanders—in those days, at all evonts ! ”
But I only laughed at tho obvious implication.
It’s a blasphomy the wandering Briton has to got
accustomed to sooner or later.
“ It’s a pity wo havon’t more of this poor follow’s
spirit among us nowadays, I admit; and, if I could
put his complete story beforo the world, I’m afraid
half tho readers thereof would cull him not a
hero, but an ass ! ”
Now, it so happened that I did afterwards get
hold of tho story, but not of any name under which
my present readers might relegate to tho one cate-
gory or tho other him whom l shall therefore
simply call tho Man.
* • * •
No studied effect of contrast could have been
groator. Tho sinking sun -striking level beneath
tho branches of the huge verongon sparkled redly
off the marvellous diamond that fronted Suldi-
Wala’s gorgeous headkerchief, off the jewelled
buttons of his baju, the gold embroidery of his silk
sarowj, the gem-encrusted scabbard of his kris—
as, with a mocking smile about his cruel, hairless
mouth, he stood and gazed upon the Man —naked
and lean ; sun-scorched and weather-worn ; shag-
bearded, and wolf-eved —but unsulxlued, and
thirsting with a deadly thirst to see this peacock
figure step'forward that other single pace that
would bring it within scope of his chain. A
hundred times, and more, had that fierce hope
been disappointed, for never one month in all
these long 12 years of horror had the Sultan failed
to make his pitiful triumph over the body of a
spirit that triumphed over him. And, as usual,
went the formula :
“ If the white man would make, even now, sub-
mission, not forgiveness merely should he have,
but riches and honors far beyond any of these.
And the Sultan waved his jewel-loaded hand
towards the chiefs who stood aloof to watch a
farce of which they had long ago grown weary.
But the Man, as had come to be his wont,
answered only with that straight, life-hungrj
stare. _
Suldi laughed, motioned to the waiting chiefs,
and stood aside as they walked slowly past and
spat, each man, upon the prisoner. But the Man
never moved muscle until they had gone laughing
away ; then, as if moved by a released spring, he
tried, with a sudden and tremendous effort, the
strength of his chain. Again and again, with a
jerk that nearly dragged his foot from the ankle,
he flung his utmost strain upon the links. And
the links—as a thousand times l>efore— only
mocked him with the stern inertness of their
resistance, till, when the swift tropic d irkne-s
came, it found him gasping, half-uncouscious,
upon the stone.
And then—was he dreaming?—or did a vo<o
say softly in his oar, “ White man, arise ! W 1 at
price wouldst thou pay for thy liberty ?’
The Man opened his eyes; there was a dim
figuro near him in the firefly spangled gloom.
"Liberty? Bah I—-it is but more mockery!
amt he flung himself down again into the groove
his miserable bones had wrung from the reluctant
rock. “Away!” la* growled. "What use of
words ! Talk of setting mo free to slay this cria 1
dog of a Sultan, and 1 will listen.”
Then he sptang up in blank astonishment, f< r
the voice said, quietly—
“ That is the service we would ask of thee."
“We?” the Man refloated, wildly. You I
Who are you 7"
" I am Walali Kb, the Multan’s brother; at d
with me, in this design, are many others. Listen ;
for there is no time for questions. If we set tl;eo
free to-night, anil hide thee at the Multan's
bathing-tank, wilt thou slay him in the morning,
os lie goeth down into the water ? ”
The 12-yoars-prisoncr gasjKsl with great joy.
"Barehanded 1” he whispered, hoarsely—“bare-
handed, I will tear his life out I Only set mo
loose and face to face with him !"
" Good I At midnight will 1 oomo again with a
blacksmith to cut thy chain. Weapons, also, will
I bring, and clothes and food. Hat, there is
another condition. The boy my brother’s son-
lie must die, too ! ”
The Man sat sullenly down again.
“Must ho? Kill him thyself, then."
“Fellow, thou dost not understand ! Mo, they
must not sus|K'ct —and will not, when it is found
that thou hast escaped.”
“I will not kill the boy."
“Then, fellow ! ” and Walali whipped out his
kris—" thou knowest too much.”
The Man laughed at him, without stirring.
“ Fool 1 Has death any terrors for me? I would
escape, if I could ; but, if it is not to lw so—why,
thrust, and make an end of it."
The other stood a few moments in thought;
then he sheathed his kris again.
“Thou wilt think bettor of it by midnight," ho
said.
• • • •
And by midnight the Man had thought hiettcr
of it—or said so.
“ Free tno from this accursed rook—if it wero
only to die the next moment."
“ The Isiy, too, then ? " W alah asked.
“Ay; tho boy, too. A hundred boys, if
needful.”
“Now thou speakest. Here is arrack ; drink,
and then eat. 1 will tell thee all while this man
worketh at thy chain.” .
Tho prisoner took a draught of what lie h id I ot
tasted for a dozen years, and—famished and nerve-
broken as he was—the spirit quadrupled its effect.
The mighty stubliornness of his nature swel l-1
again to full proportions.
“ I will kill no boy 1" lie said, as, with a sudden
stretch of his long arms, he dragged the two little
Javan is to the ground together got his knee upon
tho unarmed blacksmith snatched \\ alah s kris
from the scabbard, and sheathed it in its owner s
throat. Thrice he thrust the weapon deiqierotely
home—then kicked aside the quivering body and
gras|ssl tho astounded blacksmith by his knotted
hair. “The chain!” he said—“and quickly!"
and the blacksmith, with his hair still in tho
other's clutch, went quaking to work upon the iron.
Said the Man to him, when a link had been
severed —“ Must I kill thee, too? Or art thou
blind and dumb?” And the blacksmith-for-
getting his Mahometanism in his terror—swore by
the Forvhcad of Brahma to lie blind and dumb,
and deaf to boot!
“I will trust thee!” the man said. “The
more readily that I wouhl not shed any more
blood. Let this man’s life **• for his brother's! ”
He ate the food, finished the arrack, took the
kris and clothes, and made off. Whereupon the
blacksmith went promptly and gave the alarm.

Across the swamps of Banji they hunted the
white men—up into the Knt .lignr hills, and down
again through the tectona forests to the Sawani
Kiver ; for Soldi had sworn, if the pursuers came
empty-handed hick, to slay, by lot, every third
man amongst them.
Which thing—if they were fools enough to go
back at nll-he doubtless did. for the fugitive got
safe to Bantam (Batavia, now), where, since his
time, six generations have come and gone.
But the Stone remains !
ALKN. MONTGOMERY.
“ Phoenix ” : Reading Meston’s interest-
ing descript.on of crocodiles on the North Queens-
land rivers reminds me of a Scotch fnend who
took up a selection on the Johnstone. A big old-
man crocodile used to patrol the river snapping
up thoughtless live objects from the homestead
when thev strayed on the hank. The scaly old
bushranger was so cunning that no one ever got a
fair shot at him. He sceuied to know a gun half-
a-mile away. At last a brilliant idea occurred to
Mac. He went to the township and purchased a
coil of waterproof fuse, two or three or
dynamite, and some caps. He then got a nice
tempting piece of beef, placed it on a board, in-
serted much dvnamite with cap and fuse attached,
sent the bait'into the river, and waited on the
bank with the end of the fuse in his hand. Pre-
sently the saurian come quietly along with his
nose just showing out of the water. Mac lit the
end of the fuse. Shortly afterwards the enemy s
jaws clSd on the beef. Then there was a wait
between the acts. When the curtain rose again it
was on a fearsome explosion, and a great disturb-
ance in the water, and an awful smell of surprised
crocodile. The croc, threw his head and neck
above the surface for a moment inquiring for his
stomach, his tail showed in another direction, bits
of reptile rose here and there, and at last a great
disorganisation of scaly beast settled slowly dowu
into the mud of the Jolr.utone.

The Critic’s Larder.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
fpHIS is the lay, exultant and gay,
Of a king among men—myself;
The song of the merriest, mightiest man
That ever drew breath since the world began
A merry and mischievous elf,
And strong as the soul of the day.
This song of my might is an endless delight,
For it tells of the judgment dire
That comes to the pigmies, one and all,
That under my high displeasure fall—
That awaken my royal ire ;
Then straight they are lost to sight.
My study is cut in the great, grim gut
Of a blood-red rock that lies
Deep under the roots of the roaring mart,
In the city’s centre, a place apart;
From the peering of prying eyes,
And from prowlers shiftless shut.
But, oh ! for the story that goes before,
And the prowlers that went that way;
For some there were in the past that tried
To break my solitude’s seal, and pried—
They pry no more, nor pray,
They prowl and peer no more.
Ho ! ho ! for the tale of the authoress pale
That came to read her script—
Perhaps I would give it a title fine,
And place it with editor friends of mine.
Her hope in the bud was nipt;
In the Glebe is a voice of wail!
The man with a thirst that rashly burst
Through the bounds of my domain ;
lie “just looked in”—wouldn’t take a seat,
But, “Put on your coat and come down the
street ”
He walked no street again ;
There’s a widow in Darlinghurst!
Oh, grimly I gloat on the fate that smote
The painter-man unhung,
Who came to dilate on the shamelessness
Of the council-men of the R. A.S.—
There’s a painter less among
The crowd on the Manly boat !
A gibe I hurl at the poet-girl
Who’d an hour in the morning free ;
My den was quiet and calm and cool,
“Just up to me,” said the poor little fool;
’Tis a fair-haired ghost they see
By the waters of far Curl-Curl!
The last on the list was an Egyptist
Who practised at the Bar;
He brought an attractive bone of strife
In the mummied foot of a Pharaoh’s wife;
But he carried the thing too far—
In Mosman now he is missed.
For I lock each guest in my lethal chest;
Ho ! ho ! it is wide and deep !
As I bow them in I laugh and I mock,
And I sing to the music of bolt and lock ;
But— l wonder if they'll keep —
Till I shall have brought the rest
To dwell in my wonderful chest :
Refreshing be their sleep !

In Heaven and Another Place.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the Parisian is given the in-
junction with which it is customary to
terminate a dispute, he does not turn
to the final resort of physical force.. He goes
there. Hell is chief among the eccentric cafes of
Montmartre, and, if there is any spot on earth that
should lead to the full and proper development
of such a place, it is that same Montmartre. The
suburb is the Mecca of sin ; and, now that the
Moulin Rouge has become respectable, the Cabaret
aux Enfers is its centre. A horrible, leering
demon’s face, bright red, and with a cynical eye
cocked defiantly at the Basilica of the Sacred
Heart on the distant escarpment, rises from the
pavement of the Boulevai’d de Clichy. The face
is twelve feet high, and through the white fangs
THE MUSICIAN'S TOPHET.
°f its open mouth is the entrance. Here a man,
dressed after the manner of Mephistopheles, waves
a trident threateningly at passing mortals, and the
SWe of scarlet lights marks the spot for miles.
Into the entrance I was led by a young French-
rnan who was proudly showing me the sights of
laris. The demon lowered his trident to thrust
h* between the bars of one of two fireplaces that
anked us, and raked out a few embers. Then he
rew open a door with steel hinges, like an oven.

A BID FOR IMMORTALITY.
It was a long, narrow apartment, resembling
nothing so much as the tunnel of a mine lighted
with incandescent bulbs. A row of little tables,
just sufficiently wide for two seats, stood against
each wall, and the passage between was so narrow
that only one person could walk along it at a time.
A couple of smart demons served drinks to the cus-
tomers already there ; a third played weird airs on
a piano, on a platform raised high above the
tables; and Satan himself, with pointed black
beard and a geniality befitting his position, moved
about to make his guests uneasy. But the most
important feature of the cabaret, the one which
made it really worth visiting, was the sculpture.
The walls, from the top of the dado and under the
whole of the arched roof, were covered with
modelled figures representing the torments of the
damned. All the horrors of Dante’s “Inferno”
were presented. Men were being fried on gridirons
and sawn in halves by multitudes of fearsome devils.
The rack was in full swing, the thumbscrew was
being conscientiously applied. Sinners tied to
spits were being larded with the assiduity peculiar
to the French cuisine. All the tortures of the
Middle Ages were being carried out with the
assistance of modern inventions. The spectacle
was enough to make onlookers turn good for life
and forswear Montmartre for ever. The figures
were half life-size, terra-cotta-colored, and the
man who modelled them possessed the soul of an
artist.
We took our seats at a table, the glass top of
which glared with a sickly green light from
beneath. Satan approached with wild gesticu-
lations, and made a speech in the Montmartre
dialect, which is as distant from that of the Paris
a mile away as
Cornish is from
ordinary Eng-
lish. His re
marks were loud
and apparently
abusive, an d
greatly amusing
to a trio of
Zouaves at the
next table and
to my French
friend. Through
his laughter, the
latter ordered
deux bocks, and
remarked tome,
“Ees eet not
droll?” I fear
that I was dense
to the subtle-
ties of French
humor. “It seemed to me that he was insulting,”
I said. “ That ees eet,” explained my friend ;
“ eet ees the insoolts wheech are so droll. But—
ah —my friend, you should have been at Mont-
martre when Aristide Bruyant had his cafe. You
would receive ze insoolt at ze door. You would
have more of ze insoolt all ze time. Ze waiter
would wave ze bludgeon over your head. And
when you find ze time to go, you would getze kick-
out. Ah,” he sighed, pathetically, “we shall
never again have a droll cafe like Aristide have.”
I failed to understand. “But do you mean to
say,” I asked, “that you paid money to get
insulted?” “Eet ees droll,” he replied.
“Why,” I told him, “ out where I come from, you
can get insulted for nothing by the ‘ push ’ down
Little Bourke-street.” “ Indeed,” he sighed ;
“ what a beautiful city yours
must be, m’sieur.”
A demon came with the drinks
and a packet of pictorial post-
cards illustrating the Scrip-
tures. He took the money,
swore at my friend for not
giving a bigger tip, and walked
away, indicating us as pig-dog 3
to the rest of the assemblage.
We had our laugh when the
next pair of visitors were sub-
jected to Rabelaisian insults,
sparkling with the imagery of
the gutter.
The piano played louder.
The green lights turned to red.
Then they suddenly grew dim,
and the stuffed boa-constrictors
which squirmed over the arched
ceiling became endowed with
life. They unwound and twisted
and lowered their heads almost
into the faces of the visitors.
Satan stepped forward again
and made a speech, and we all
rose and followed him into the
next room—a tiny apartment
with forms, concert fashion, and
a small proscenium, all painted
snakes and demons, at one end.
The ghostly curtain rose, and
there was a brazier on the
stage. Satan entered, and one
of the waiters took his stand
in the brazier. Elames burst
from its sides, and the waiter
was gradually consumed before
our eyes. It was an excellent
illusion. Not a sign of its work-
ing was perceptible. After it
had been repeated with varia-
tions, the entertainment closed
with an exhibition of nude dam-
sels. A devil at the door held a
tambourine under our noses for
coppers, and in exchange gave
us a memento of our visit in the
shape of a little red devil on a
pin, which we each wore proudly
on the lapel of the coat.
Next door to Hell is Heaven,
designed like an exaggerated
edition of a Gothic cathedral.
Its fayide is a mass o.'
highly-colored mullions and
gargoyles and crockets, an 1 its windows glare
with ribald caricatures in imitation of stained
glass. The doorkeeper is St. Peter, complete in
his wings, sandals, halo, keys, and long white
beard. He threw open the jasper gate as wo
approached and welcomed us as brands from the
burning. The interior, replete with all the acces-
sories of sacred art, is a well-designed scheme of a
church interior, which might lie used effectively in
genuine stone. The space, like that m the Oabaiet
aux Enfers, is small, and the long, narrow table
that extends down the centre, in caricature of
the Last Supper, leaves little room to scramble
into your seat. There are no insults
here. The winged and haloed waiters attend
respectfully in their long, white robes, and when
you give your order they call it to the archangel
at the beer-pump in the chancel. He answers
impressively “Thy will be done,” and your drink
is placed before you. Solemn music is played on
an organ by a golden-haired female angel in a
decollete robe at one side of the pulpit, and when
the drinks are consumed St. Peter mounts this
and sprinkles the assemblage with a brush
dipped in a domestic vessel before him. He
makes a speech in which all are invited to
partake of the pure joys of Heaven, and the
only stern words spoken are the rebukes given
to any persons who treat the occasion with
unbecoming levity. In silence, and with due
solemnity, we climbed a set of gilt stairs, and
found ourselves in a room the walls and ceilings of
which were painted to represent clouds and stars.
Here a sinner was tried, and his punishment
determined by the conclave of angels, whose task
of serving drinks was temporarily suspended. The
details of the trial and the carrying-out
of the sentence would scarcely suit an audi-
ence in Australia, even one destitute of
religious beliefs ; but the men and maidens of
Montmartre, and even the respectable oversea
strangers, joined in the laughter. Then came a
grand gathering of angels, among whom we recog-
nised several of the young ladies who took part in
the living-picture show next door. Hoisted on
wires, they spun right over our heads, performing
an aerial quadrille before they retired to tuck their
heads beneath their wings for the night. There
was the inevitable collection—sinners and saints
are alike in this respect in Europe—and we
trooped out into the" open air.
The red arms of the Moulin Rouge were turning
slowly before us as the big music-hall discharged
its patrons. We crossed and saw them spread
fan-wise over the road. They were not the true
frequenters of Montmartre. There were evi-
dences of healthy enjoyment of life about these
young fellows and girls who had just had full
value for their two francs ad mission-money to the
promenade. Students with strange hats and
cloaks and premature beirds were there with
laughing grisettes from the Latin Quarter and the
rest of the component parts of Paris. These are
the true Bohemians. Montmartre is not for them,
except when they visit the music-halls, or on the
occasion of their annual pilgrimage to the Ball of
the Pour Arts. Their Bohemianism is youthful,
exuberant, spontaneous. That of Montmartre is
a degenerate sham, carefully rehearsed and
assiduously pumped up. And yet there are
Parisians who spend night after night in Heaven,
Hell, or one of the other eccentric cabarets ; for,
despite all assertions to the contrary, the floating
population contributes little on ordinary occasions
to their coffers.
My friend was strangely silent as I watched, the
MUCH SUPERIOR.
GWENDOLINE (hanghtily): “My ma keeps a
servant.”
VIOLET : " Hoo ! that's nothin'. My via keeps pa."
crowds swell down the slopes to Paris. We
paused to say good-bye. “Ah,” he said, with a
smile, “some day I veel come to your beyutitul
citee and you veel take me to zat droll place
what you call eet ?—ze Boul de Petit Bourke,
where Messrs, le poushe insult you for niizzmg.

The Dreamers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HIS REVERENCE KNEW.
HARD-UP SWAGGIE : “ Good morning, Father; cou'd you oblige us with a trifle ? Times are
bad, and no work.”
PRIEST (handing out a shilling): "Oh, yes. Have it put in the billy, my man; you'll get
more that way.”
HAVE courage, O my comradrie of Dreamers!
All things except mere Earth are ours ;
We pluck its passions for our flowers ;
Dawn-dyed, our great cloud banners toss their
streamers
Above the World’s old tyrant-towers,
Or make our stern, grey Planet young with jewel-
showers.
Through all the Spirit’s spacious, voiceless regions,
By pathways we believed unknown,
Still Thoughts immortal meet our own—
Ideas —in innumerable legions—
Like Summer’s stir in forests lone,
Their music merges in a monotone.
Our lives are mantled in forgotten glory,
Like trees that fringe a dark hill crest,
Alight against the molten West.
Out ot the great Night breathes each piteous
story—
The Dreams that stir the Past’s long rest—
Like scented night-winds on our naked breast.
The Dreamer sees the deep-drawn ore-veins
bright’ning
Through all the huge blind bulk of Earth ;
He led the Ship around its girth ;
He plays upon the pulses of the lightning
A music that the World gives forth ;
Through darkness brings Man’s Morrow to the
birth.
11l fare the Doers, blind and dull and dreamless,
Whose bodies engines are of toil;
Greasy with greed and lust they moil;
They cast lots for The Dreamer’s garment seam-
less
To rot among their useless spoil.
The holy heights of heavens their smoke doth soil.
Hail to the dream that roused the sleeping savage
And led him from his bloody lair
Across that Bridge—the single hair
Above the broad, unpurposed Hell of Ravage
That, beasts and men, the soulless share,
And left him, waking in Thought’s temple,
Heaven’s heir !
Our souls, in those near Heavens, unbeholden
Of eyes, our angel-hopes embrace,
Or all the maze of joy retrace;
These secret skies about our souls enfolden,
In rapture of their kindred race ;
And God’s sad eyes upon us, face to face.
Ah, God ! It was in some old dream of beauty
You wrought our world so strange and fair,
Afloat in its illusive air !
I deem the rite of dreaming is a duty,
And dreams more intimate than prayer,
While dream-stuff floods existence, sweet and rare.

SYDNEY JEPHCOTT.
The “Dook”—His Inquest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A HUGE, roughly circular mound of
almost pure iron rising fantastically from
the dead-level plain of dreary, stunted
saltbush ; about a hundred tents and huts dotted
about, and a four-roomed wood and iron building,
almost imposing in its surroundings—the Iron-
heart Hotel. Such is Fluxton, sprung into exist-
ence through the hunger of many mines for its
ironstone flux. The inhabitants are a rough, hard
lot; brawn is their sole capital, and on Saturday,
which was pay-day, Hennessey, the proprietor of
the shanty, prospered exceedingly. From mid-
day on Saturday until Monday morning he dis-
pensed his villainous stuffs. He possessed a left
of the “dirtiest” description, and the way he had
spread Billy M‘Gill hardened the palates of the
critical. Billy had said, after his first taste of the
brandy, “Well, as you invented it, ’Ennessey,
ole man, I s’pose y’ve got a perfec’ right ter ’ave
yer name on thebottle.”
Billy now took his poison without comment,
and when a travelling Baptist Missionary struck
the camp and remonstrated with the men for their
weekly orgies, ’twas Billy who spoke in defence
of the pub. “Blime, Mister,” he said, “’En-
nessey’s our wife and kids, and our little front
garden; d’yer expect us ter go picking buttercups
orf the bloomin’ saltbush in our spare time ?
Yer can stick up yer bloomin’ Joss-’ouse if yer
like; I’ll guarantee yer won’t be crowded incon-
venient.” The mild Missioner fled, horrified.
Late one Saturday afternoon the crowd was
busy pouring the product of its muscle into
Hennessey’s till, when Snowy Johnson rushed
into the bar, pale with excitement. “The Dook’s
cut ’is throat, down in ’is ’ut! ” he said, shakily.
The “Dook” was the curiosity of the place.
He held absolutely aloof from the others, who in-
stinctively reciprocated. Every Saturday he took
an amazing quantity of Hennessey’s mixture to
his hut, and was seen no more until work was
begun again. But now he won a wide popu-
larity. Fights' had become too common to in-
terest, and a new excitement was a crying need.
Big Moore took charge of the ceremonies.
“’Ovv did it’appen, Snowy?”
“I was cornin’ up past’is’ut, when I ’eard a
’orrible row ; I looked in and saw ’im spread out
on ’is bunk with an ’ole in ’is neck, bleedin’ fear-
ful, so I rushed up and told you blokes.”
Moore and half-a-dozen others crowded into the
hut. “Muster’ad the jumps or ’e wouldn’t’ave
done it with a bottle,” said Moore. “One o’ yer
blokes fetch Dutchy ’ere ! ” Dutchy, having once
put a broken limb in rough splints, was credited
with vast medical knowledge.
“ Y’ve been a ’ell over time,” said Moore, growl-
ing. “Is ’e dead, Dutchy ? ”
The man bent over the bunk. “He have his
yugular cut,” he remarked, laconically.
“ None’r yer Latin, Dutchy ! Is ’e a stiff un ? ”
“ Can do nodings ; soon vill be dead.”
The diagnosis was accepted without question,
and the crowd went back to Hennessey’s to dis-
cuss the event and to arrange for the burial of the
Dook. On account of his size rather than of his
erudition, Moore took the chair. He looked
round importantly-—“As the Dook’s our first
dead un, I prepose we ’ave a ’oliday fer the
funeral.” The proposal was carried with accla-
mation.
Someone proposed to drink the Dook’s health,
and the proceedings were momentarily adjourned.
“Is any of you blokes a J.P. ?” asked
Hennessey.
“Wot!” said Moore. He reached over the
low counter, grabbed the proprietor by the neck,
and with some assistance pulled him over on to
the floor and sat on him.
“ I apolergise. Get orf me chest, Moore.”
“ Drinks orl round, then ? ”
“Oh, orl right! Git orf me chest, yer big
ellerphant.”
“ You’ll’ave ter’ave a J.P.,” said Hennessey,
sulkily, as he served them out.
“ Wot for ? ”
“Ter give a stifferkit of death.”
“But Dutchy said ’e’s as good as a stifFun ;
cut ’is juglar or somethin’.”
“ ’Oo’s Dutchy ? ” said Hennessey, impatiently;
“ ’e can’t ’old’r inquest.”
“Can’t yer, Dutchy?” asked Billy M‘Gill,
looking round. “ Ther blighter’s sloped. ’E
always was ’r unpatryotic bloke. But ’Ennessey’s
right, Moore. I remember ”
“ But where kin we git this ’ere josser,
’Ennessey ? ” broke in Donnelly.
“ Ole M'Quillin at Port Douglas’ll come, if yer
make it worth ’is while. I’ll lend yer me ’orse,
and ’e ort ter git ’ere in two days.”
“ I don’t see wot we want ’im fer at all,” said
Moore, sulkily ; “ ’e don’t know the Dook ! ”
“ Don’t matter ; yer must ’ave ’im. Ye mustn’t
touch the body till ’e comes neither, Moore.”
“ Who wants ter touch it ? ” asked the big man,
fiercely.
* * * *
The Justice arrived in two days, and speedily
dispelled all prejudice by his liberality at the bar.
It was felt that it would be ill-mannered to thrust
the unpleasant business upon him until the next
morning. By then the Law’s representative could
not remember his name, much less write it. At
mid-day he had recovered sufficiently to institute
some feeble inquiries, and held an informal Court
on the floor of the Ironheart Hotel bar. He dis-
pensed with a jury, and interrogated Snowy,
Dutchy and Moore between drinks, and then re-
tired to consider his verdict—that is, he rolled
over and went to sleep.
Billy M'Gill reached over and shook the Coroner
roughly.
“ Wake up, Boko ! 1 Wot’s the verdic’ ? ”
M‘Quillin slowly raised himself into a sitting
posture, and regarded Billy with awful severity :
“You’re fined hun’red pounds—contempt of
court.”
“You be blessed,” said Billy, genially. “Wot’s
yer verdic’ ? ”
“ Six months,” said the Justice, solemnly.
Moore here took an active part in the inquest.
He prodded the Justice with his foot.
“We want ter know if ther Dook’s dead,” he
yelled.
The Coroner blinked. “ Dook ! Who’s he ? ”
The big man danced with rage. “Yer blanky
old fool, we’ve brought yer a ’undred miles fer this
inquest, and now you’ve forgot it all. I tell yer
the Dook’s cut ’is juglar, an’ ’e’s dead ! ”
“ Killed a juggler, has he ? ’Rest him ’meejutly.”
“ Wot is ’e talkin’ about, Billy ? ” asked Moore,
pathetically. “ I’m fair sick of ’im.”
Billy sat down by the Coroner and put his arm
round him.
“ It’s the Dook wot’s dead. The juggler’s a’ole

“Dead!” said the Coroner. “Oh, the poor
feller ! ” and he sobbed aloud.
“ Better git ’im to sign the death-warrant,” said
Hennessey from the bar. “’Ere it is; I’ve bin
lookin’ through his traps. There’s some other
papers, too.”
“Never mind them,” said Moore. “’And it
over.”
But M‘Quillin insisted on hearing the evidence
all over again. Then, moved by the combined
threats of Moore and M‘Gill, he consented to
record his verdict. The paper handed to him was
a subpoena form, on the back of which he wrote
with a spluttering wavy pen :
The Dook died by the hand of his own bottle.

“J.F.D The crow, looking at him
apart from his criminal propensities, is about tl
most intelligent of Australian fowls. He j s
thinker, and can sit still and cogitate with a lool-
of wisdom gummed over his features that i s .J
approachable. The magpie gets near the look
after years of captivity, puts all remarks through
a severe analytical process. He is the Nihilist
among birds—the black revolutionist; but he let ■
no other bird know his ideas. He is unfathom-
able. Other birds distrust him, and the crow
looks on them with contempt and pulls their
when occasion offers. I put a cockatoo and a
crow into a cage in my window, as a study in black
and white, and the foppishness of the old white
dandy made the crow laugh deep down in his
bosom The cockatoo had a limited vocabulary
which he rehearsed continuously, and the “oh-
damn-it-can’t-you-say-something-else ” look on the
crow was laughable. When the cockatoo napped
the crow would peck him sharply, and the fop
would wake up with a screech. Then he would
find the crow contemplating a drunk on the
other side of the street with a dull, stupid
look that would bluff a smarter fowl than
a . cockatoo. The cocky would ruffle up
his . poll feathers and talk excitedly about
having the cage searched for peace-disturbers,
but the crow took no notice. He was thinking
what a fool he was to get captured. He was a
high-class criminal in gaol among a lot of brainless
corn thieves. The crow had canker, and I rubbed
his bill with ointment that smelt horribly, and
for days afterwards he stared at the cockatoo,
wondering how he could strut about and talk
when he was in such an advanced state of decom-
position. No matter how ancient the crow may
be when captured he is willing to assimilate know-
ledge, and will grip new ideas and tricks, although
he may have enough lamb murders on his con-
science to keep him awake all night. The two
crows trained by Edwards, of Bland Holt's co. for
the bush-fire scene in the “Breaking of the
Drought” were ancients. More lies have been
told by bushmen about crows than were told about
the Boers.

JONES’S FIRST GREAT SPLASH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE days of Jones’s cadetship expired
while he was at Puketapu Junction, and
because he had influence he was promptly
appointed to be Sub-Stationmaster at Burning
Plains. Burning Plains had the reputation of
being the most difficult station on the section, and
it was understood that Barton, who had been
transferred three times, but always brought back
on account of the incapacity of his successor, was
a fixture for life.
On the way to his new position Jones called in
at Romahapa Traffic Office, as per instructions,
and found Mr. Muter seated at his table in the
long room of many windows. The Traffic Cleric
was cordiality itself. He begged Mr. Jones to be
seated, and, producing a box of cigars, invited
him to fill his case for the journey.
“This is your opportunity, Jones. Mr. Mac-
kenzie arranged the transfer purposely to give you
a show to set the section on fire. Make a great
splash, and so justify your rapid promotion. You
see we can’t promote you, even with your political
backing, if you don’t show aptitude—merit must
get some recognition. Make a great splash ! Al-
ways aim to make a great splash ! ”
* * * *
The weather was frightfully windy and scorch-
ingly hot. Great clouds of dust obscured the sky and
occasionally reduced the day to a species of twi-
light. The wind blew with such force that time
and again the train was held up till the gusts
slackened. Jones was impatient to start making
a splash, and used such language that the occu-
pants of the first-class smoker, in which he burnt
the Traffic Clerk’s Havanas, concluded that he
was a sort of understudy to the General Manager.
About noon the train crawled into Burning
Plains station, and J ones, holding his hat on with
one hand and lugging his gripsack with the other,
staggered to the office door, kicked it open, and
remarked pleasantly, as the papers flew around
the room, that it was an adjective cow of a day.
The tall S.M., with the long white beard, dived
down on his knees for some fugitive documents,
and then, rising, sternly requested Mr. Jones
never again to use such language in that office.
Later on Mr. Jones remarked to Mr. Barton
that he rather thought that little pleasantry about
the weather was a sanguinary bloomer.
Mr. Barton smiled a superior smile.
“Yes, it was rather a faux pas. Mr. Gill is a
man of deeply religious temperament,” he drawled
in a sanctimonious tone. “I hope you will ex-
perience no difficulty—the place is rather a tough
one. The people require the exercise of a con-
siderable amount of tact to keep them in a pleasant
frame of mind. Mr. Gill is very anxious to stand
well with the public, and dislikes anything
approaching rigid adherence to cast-iron rules. I
presume you can exercise tact.”
“Oh, yes, heaps of it!” snarled Jones, who
suddenly discovered that he hated Barton.
When Barton stood on the van-platform of No.
28 North he shook hands with Mr. Gill with great
warmth, and that ancient officer said loud enough
for all to hear : “ Haste ye back again ! ”
Then the train moved off. Mr. Barton bowed
condescendingly to Mr. Jones, who mentally re-
marked that he didn’t like the expression about the
comers of the fellow’s mouth.
* * * *
Had Jones been suddenly dropped into the
centre of the Pacific he could not have been more
at sea than he was at Burning Plains. The work
Was of a nature of which he had no experience, for,
the town being a manufacturing centre, all sorts
of district rates were in operation to encourage
local industry. Goods for export paid a higher
rate than those for home consumption, but not so
high as the general rate for the same class over
the rest of the Maoriland railways. Raw material
for manufacture inwards paid lower rates still,
and all these things tended to the confusion of a
new man, for the S.M., who was profoundly
’gnorant of the whole business, could give him
practically no assistance, and Jones had to read
laboriously through the tariff gazette and dig it
all out for himself. Further, Gill’s insatiable love
°f popularity led to the acceptance of goods and
Parcels while the train by which they were to go
forward was in the station, and the public used to
walk into the office and start making out its own
invoices, leaving dirty finger-marks on the way-
bill book, while Jones sold passenger tickets.
At the end of the week Jones found himself
developing a tendency to gibber.
He protested to Gill, and that individual replied
with irrelevant scraps of Scripture. Jones bias?
Piemed, and the *old man used to pray for
him and report him to the Manager in turn.
n a week Jones had been censured twice and
nod three times for using language unbecoming
0 atl officer and calculated to subvert the dis-
cipline of Maoriland railways. When the circular
a vised the section of the fact the staff shook its
' ea d> and said that, for a straight-haired man,
°Pes was going it.
k’H wrote a long report to the Traffic Office, in
' v noli he said that, although Mr. Jones was wildly
energetic and willingness itself, he was slow at
t |' s ' Vor l f > devoid of tact, and deficient in arith-
(,e lu - It was such a sweeping indictment that
11 expected that Barton would be back next
Id y at the latest.
*-d of Barton, The Raven, the demon
cif n >r ’ an 'i ve( f> and clawed the station unmer-
(This was the blessed result of Jones
political influence.) The Raven made
• gigantic list of blunders in charges, and
lie ie station as being the worst-managed
V6r m i s f° l 't ulie to audit. The
Wo j Ironmaster, he said, was new to the
Inn S lk® S.M. either couldn’t help
or wouldn’t. Had the S.M. done his
duty, the mistakes would not have been made,
as the Sub was making a big fight in the face of
overwhelming difficulties. The fact that Jones
had political influence stuck out all over the
report.
While The Raven was writing this the
Express came in. A man rushed in to say he
had a side of beef which must go in the roadside
waggon. The S.M. shoo’d him out of the office.
Two storekeepers dashed through the door to-
gether, and tore the parcels waybill book in their
struggle to get it first. Jones was at the tele-
graph instrument. The auditor gasped and then
choked, and rushed out of the place.
With the man who wanted to send away the
sid® of beef shouting in his left ear, Jones took
the following telegram with his right
Eli Zaboth Mason Express Burning- Plains. Do not
replace goods, bag recovered, going forward stock
special this night. A. Mackenzie.
Jones went out and searched up and down the
Express for a man with a Jewish cast of counten-
ance. Then he inquired. No one claimed the
n l ame - i Jones began to think, and the more he
thought the more certain he was there must be
some mistake. No one ever saw a Jew a mason
unless he were a Freemason. However, the

Express could not wait longer, and Jones reluc-
tantly postponed the clearing up of the mystery
till afterwards.
After lunch he discovered that the bellowing of
the man who wanted to send the beef had caused
a pretty mess. The message was to Elizabeth
Mason, whose luggage had been lost, and who
was about to depart for the interior, and had
arranged that, if she did not hear from the Railway
Department at Burning Plains, she was to replace
the lost goods at Government expense. She did
not want to hear from the Department, and imme-
diately the train arrived, instead of inquiring at
the office, went off with a rush to commence
shopping, so as to have it done before information
about the lost property could reach her.
All this damaged j ones’ reputation as a tele-
graphist.
* * * *
No. 2 North arrived at Burning Plains at 6.45
a.m., and was due to leave again at 6.52, the in-
terval being for the passengers to get a cup of hot
coffee and swallow a scalding egg or two. The
interval was cut down to seven minutes that they
might not have time to comment on the egg.
Jones was always on duty for No. 2. One morn-
ing, just as she was due to leave, a man in kilts
rushed in and said he must get two horses away
to Rosebank siding by her, and that he would
give a cheque for the freight that night when he
returned.
Jones disliked kilts.
“If you haven’t got the spoof the horses can’t
go, unless you send them to the next booking-
station and pay the freight on delivery.”
The man in kilts put his muddy boots on Jones’
chair.
“Ye dinna seem to be aware that I’m the
member for these pairts, ma laddie.”
“I don’t care if you’re the member for Hades
and Mount Sinai. If you can’t pay for the horses
they stay here till you do. Take your loamy hoof
off my chair.”
Porter Muir stuck his head inside the door :
“ Them horse-boxes is on the train, Mr. Jones.”
“ Are they ! Well, you can just take them off
again. No one told you to put ’em on, and as the
gentleman can’t pay for them, off they come.
Hurry up, she’s due away now.”
Several people were frantically asking what
about the parcels they had brought, but Jones
ignored them. Porter Muir was standing in the
office with his cap on, gaping at the Sub. Mr.
Jones noticed the cap.
Blast your impudence ! Take off your cap in
the office, and get those horse-boxes off at once if
you don’t want to be suspended.”
“ Dinna ye do it, Muir ; I’ll stand to ye ! ” said
M‘Bally, M.H.R. *
Jones boiled over and approached the M.H.R.
with blood in his eye.
“You dare to tell my men not to obey my
orders ! Take that, for an impudent ruffian ! ”
The man in kilts reeled against the desk. Muir,
shouting for help, caught his superior officer by
the arm and waist and rushed him against the
wall. The M. H.R. recovered himself and, dash-
ing in, kicked Muir twice and Jones once. Jones
shook the porter off as though he were a puppy and
dealt the M.H.R. another right on the point of
the. chin. Then, as Muir caught hold of him
again, he swung round and uppercut that disloyal
servant with the left and laid him out with a
right cross. The M.H.R. biffed him with both
hands at once, but before he could follow it up,
had his false teeth wrecked with a right counter
and his wind knocked out with a left short-arm
jolt. By this time the police, assisted by a shunter
and a guard, succeeded in hauling the battered
intruder off and holding the bloodthirsty officer
against the wall. M‘Bally desired to be placed in
the first-class carriage, and went off to Romahapa
to see the Traffic Manager.
* * * *
When Mr. Gill heard of this encounter a few
minutes later he was seized with an attack of
heart-failure. The member was his best friend,
and that he should have been battered in his,
Gill’s, office, in such a frightful manner, made him
positively ill. He sent for the doctor and got a
certificate that he was too shocked to come on
duty, and Jones wired to Romahapa to that effect.
He received no reply, for the very powerful
reason that the wire was down. By two o’clock
there were two washaways between Romahapa and
Greyville. By three p.m, ten miles of railroad
was under water, and traffic between Burning
Plains and Romahapa was suspended. The guard
of No. 28 North came into the station and reported
that the driver was afraid to venture on to
Wairiri River bridge with the train, and awaited
instructions.
Here was an opportunity. Gill was ill. Com-
munication with the head-office was cut off, and a
train was in danger. Jones removed the steak
from his face, patted his bruised knee, and said to
himself he would now make his great splash.
“All right, Tom, I’ll come down and see what
is to be done,” he said, reaching for his coat.
The land was veiled in mist through which fell
sheets of rain. The trolly made slow progress
through the waters till they came to Wairiri grade;
then she slid easily down the incline, and the
raging river and the great cylinder bridge, with
trees and driftwood piled against it, came in sight.
Beyond, on the other side, loomed the train,
water running over the floors of the carriages.
It took an hour to rig a wire and basket, and then
Jones got across the bridge and interviewed the
driver.
“What’s up, Jack? Don’t you think she’ll
carry ?”
“ Na, Ah doon’t ! An’ we’re in a sair pickle if we
stay here. The water’s ruz this much since the
guard ganged up tae ye.”
“Well, if this rain keeps up it’ll wash out the
ballast, and every-
thing on the train
will be destroyed.
I think we’d better
take her across,
Jack. She’ll stand.
The extra weight
will help to hold
it against the flood
and the trees.-”
“ Ye’ll liae to
shoulder the re-
sponseebeelity, Mr.
Jones.”
“Certainly, Jack,
certainly. But see
here. I think we’d
better get the pas-
sengers across in
the basket, and then
you’ll just have to
fasten the lever,
cross yourself, and
the fireman can let
her go very slowly.
He can get
across before she
gets on to the
bridge. You can
climb on board and
get control again
when she’s safely
over.”
“ Mon, ye air a
genius. It’s a Traffic
Manager ye’ll he
after this ! ” said
Driver Jack, seeing
how it could be
done without risk-
ing a single life.
“ Right you are.
I’ll give you writ-
ten instructions and
take your receipt
for them in my
pocket-book.”
He scribbled the
necessary authority,
and Jack signed for
it clumsily, after
drying his fingers
on a piece of cot ton-
waste. Then the
passengers, many of
them howling dis-
mally, were taken
across the bridge
that seemed to rock
beneath the shock
of the piled -up
waters and the drift-
wood. The last load
was over, and the
rain poured more
and more heavily.
The night came
down with a rush,
and Jones urged ex-
pedition, to get the
train across before
dark.
Jack appeared on
the northern side of
the river, having
fastened the lever.
Jones waved a white
light. The basket
came swinging
along witn the fire-
man in it, and the
train, snorting
heavily, was seen
gliding on to the
bridge. It stood
like a rock.
“Hurrah !” yell-
ed Jones; “she’s
as safe as the bank ;
pity the people got
wet. Still, we
couldn’.t take any
risks.”
On she came. The whole train, consisting of the
big English engine, 30 trucks, three carriages,
and a guard’s van, was on the bridge. The great
headlight was streaming cheerfully over the group
waiting on the approach, when suddenly there
was an awful crack. The northern end of the
bridge tilted; a great mass of driftwood had
struck it like a battering-ram. The waters piled
up on top, and surged and pressed, and the bridge
slowly bent outward, bow-shaped, but still un-
broken.
They held their breaths.
The train crept on to the portion that was bend-
ing. There was a rending sound. It bent still
more ; the engine sank over on one side.
“ She’s off the rail; ah, ma engine ! —ah, ma
engine !—God hae mercy on ma engine ! ” howled
the Scotch driver.
“ Whoop, there she goes ! ” yelled Jones.
The engine turned over and rolled down on
the great girders. The couplings broke, and
the trucks went tumbling down pell-mell. The
bridge snapped with a report like that of a dozen
cannon, and the great 40-ton locomotive, 30 trucks
and carriages and van went down into the water
with a tremendous roar. The boiler burst,
fragments of steel came hurtling through the air,
and above the swish of the rain and the roar of
the triumphant river was the Scotch driver’s
lament, “Ah, ma engine—ma bonny, bonny
engine ! ”
“By G , I have made a splash !” said Jones
to himself, with a shudder.

Fact’ry ’Ands.
THE WOOING OF MINNIE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DO TNG HIS BEST.
SISTER: “ You greedy Tittle beast, you've eaten those three dozen tarts, every one!”
YOUNG BROTHER: “ Well, didn't yer tell me to amuse the company!"
AFTER years spent in the quest of the
perfect boy, Odgson seemed satisfied that
the species became extinct when he grew
up, and a man was engaged to assist at the guillo-
tines and do the rouseabout work of the factory.
Chiller Green was about 24, and a sinister young
man at first sight. He came on to the flat with
the tips of his fingers dipped behind his belt in
front, his chin thrust forward, and his eyes full of
truculence. He surveyed the room and its occu-
pants coldly, and his expression implied a certain
disgust at finding himself in such cheap company.
As he glared, his chin moved in a chewing action,
leisurely and insolent. The movement was purely
for effect; Chiller had nothing to chew. He was
dressed in a soft black felt hat, high in the crown
—a kind much affected by jockey-boys ; a short,
faded coat; trousers very skimped in the waist,
and high-heeled boots. These were the days of
the larrikin Renaissance.
A facetious clerk called up the tube to Feathers :
‘ ‘ Accept delivery of the new boy. Please forward
receipt at your convenience.”
The packer grinned. “ Are you the new boy ? ”
he said.
Chiller looked sidelong at the packer’s feet with
contemptuous casualness. “I’m Chiller Green,
amachoor bantim champyin o’ the Port,” he re-
plied.
“Don’ mention it,” said Feathers, cordially.
“I’m jest a-sayin’,” continued Chiller, “I’m
man enough to go on with, s’posin’ anyone’s
wantin’ anythin’.”
“ G’out ! ” said Feathers ; “ I’ll contract to bury
all your dead with the fat-money from a brick-mill.
Iv you’ve come ’ere t’ work, sling off yer coat ’n’
get a move, ’r the forewoman ’ll smack you.”
Chiller spat with scientific precision, turned
slowly away, and slouched towards the changing-
room.
The impression Chiller Green conveyed during
those first few minutes proved to be quite er-
roneous. The new hand was really a jaunty,
companionable youth, and demonstrated as much
within a week by inaugurating a boxing class in
the lift corner, and fraternally blackening the
packer’s eye during the luncheon hour. The
boxing-gloves were extemporised out of pairs of
working-stockings discarded by the Beauties.
Green was the pride of a suburban “push,” and was
certainly not more impudent than was excusable in
a man who could “hook” with both hands and had
“done time” because a bush-bred policeman had
no more respect for his head than to leave it in the
way when the “push ” was throwing bricks about.
Chiller was not backward in publishing his record.
He promised to show Feathers a “ boshter knack
for passing out gazobs.”
“ Got on to it when I was ‘ up,’ ” he said.
“ Gar-rn ! ” said the packer.
“ Oh, I done my bit, ” Chiller went on. “ ’Tain’t
nothin’ agen me, though. Jist lined a John with a
half-Brunswick, ’n got four moon. Knocked him
fair off his trolly.”
“Iv it gets known here they’ll bounce you on
the pavement.”
“My trubs ! I’d have a cut at ole Spats hisself
if ’e looked cock-eyed at me.” Chiller tilted his
truck-load on to its base, put his hands up to
nothing, did a shadowy spar, and then danced a
few steps indicative of his cheerful indifference.
“I kinalwez get back ter ther trade, ” he said ;
“on’y it’s Chinaman’s work.”
“ ’N what’s yer trade ? ” asked Feathers.
“Barrerin’ rabbies. They’s money in it when
meat’s riz, but push in’ a barrer gets a man down.
I tell yer, specially in the winter mon’s. I reckon
I’ll hang up here ’n make a name fer mesilf.”
“ Hope you’ll keep us all on when you take over
the business,” said the town-traveller.
The “bantim champyin” sparred at Goudy,
feinted and baulked in a highly decorative way,
and tweaked the big man’s goatee, making
at the same time a plaintive baa-ing. Then
he resumed his burden and passed on, sing-
ing something to the effect that he could get a
sweetheart any day, but not another mother.
Chiller’s taste in songs inclined to the sentimental
and woebegone.
The town-traveller’s remark was called for.
Already Chiller Green had assumed dominance in
the factory. The deprecatory Ellis was most
polite towards his assistant. The foreman’s
native timidity doomed him to be an easy victim
to the audacity of young Mr. Green. Chiller
respected nobody. When Spats visited the fac-
tory flat the Bantam outraged his dignity and
ruined his influence by ridiculing him with
audacious effrontery. As a compliment to
Odgson’s hairiness Chiller had christened him
Jo-Jo, and he indulged in doggy pantomime at
the heels of the proprietor, or whined and yapped
plaintively for the edification of the pasters. He
also scattered choice sotto voce reflections on Spats,
his appearance, manners, and relations, including
a purely hypothetical Aunt Lucy, and it was car-
ried on with bravado that amounted to insane
recklessness in the minds of the girls.
Chiller’s manner towards the girls was familiar
and flippant. Even the superiority-of the two or
three sedate and somewhat elderly pasters, who
preserved a certain aloofness, had no effect upon
the. Bantam’s exuberance, and he maintained for
their benefit an assumption of close and intimate
friendship that they seemed to find extremely
galling. Miss Stevens was the most reserved of
all these. The factory had endowed her with
aristocratic antecedents and romantic misfortunes,
and even the ragamuffin Beauties called her
“ Miss.” She was 33, and scornful.
“What-o, Steve! How-de-do-dy ? ” was Chil-
ler’s morning greeting. Miss Stevens treated him
as if he were something to which the attention of
the Board of Health should be drawn at the
earliest possible mordent; but, addressing a neigh-
bor, the young man would continue brightlv,
“Great cobbers, me ’n’ Steve. She kin keep
n 'thin’ from me ; tells me all her secrets. No
end o' conferdence in me, she’s got. Used to be a
friend o’ mother’s. How’s the indigestion this
mornin’, Sissy ? ” Miss Stevens’ name was not
Sissy ; she had no indigestion. Her wrath towards
Mr. Green was silent, but very deep.
But Benno, the clerk, Mr. Green refused to take
seriously, at any time or in any capacity. He
called him “Tutsie,” and insisted that, despite
his present pretensions, his antecedents were of
the lowest.
“How’s yer ole pot-’n’-pan, Tutsie?” said
Chiller. “When I knew him, he was head shop-
walker to a saverloy-can, ’n’ yer mother was
carryin’ round babies t’ ther poor, ’n’ runnin’ a
‘families supplied ’ emporium in Paddy’s Alley.”
“Le’ go me leg,” retorted the clerk, smartly.
“’N’ ’ere ’re you, wearin’ made-t’-measure
suits, ’n’ collars what turn down all round, ’n’
splashin’ yerself agin the verandy posts o’ fine
nights, like a young dook.”
• $ * •
Mr. Green’s spirits were guaranteed to keep in
any climate. When the factory was cold it was
as inclement as a refrigerating mill, and when it
was hot it was suggestive of a material hell with
all the modern improvements in house-warming;
but, cold or hot, Green retained his flippancy,
and went about his work with abounding cheer-
fulness. He frequently paused by the way to put
up a vivacious spar with a stack of parcels, and
every now and again he threw in a “dead flash ”
scrap of step-dancing, or sang a couple of lines of
a popular music-hall chorus with original effects.
This was before The Spadger began to get in
her work. The Spadger was a little folder, so
called because Feathers had discovered in her a
strong resemblance to a bedraggled sparrow. She
was waspish and thin, with a nose like a cheap
wooden doll’s, round eyes, and a mouth puckered
into an ineradicable perkiness. Her walk had a
confident sort of hop in it. Her ginger hair was
literally dragged, into a knot at the back.
''V.hiicn was always misplaced, soNhfitidifir. head h id
a cunning appearance of being pulled to one side
or the other. She dressed very poorly, and her
hats looked like some few unconsidered trifles col-
lected on a plate. She was old-maidish at 18.
Her name was Minnie Silver.
Chiller had been in the factory two months or
more before he noticed Minnie particularly. When
he began to offer her little attentions his manner
was still gaily impertinent, and the small folder
ignored him with elaborate disdain that was a
grotesque parody of the arts and graces of her
betters. When she came up the stairs Chiller
would make a burlesque demonstration, dusting
the floor, and bustling pasters and parcels out
of the way.
“Hello there, get off the earth!” cried the
Bantam, “’ere comes the little Duchess. How’s
it this mornin’, yer Grace ? ”
Miss Silver’s nose would be hoisted into the air,
her under-lip would curl outwards disdainfully,
and she would sweep aside her scrap of faded
skirt, and pass on with intense hauteur. Then
Chiller to the packer : “Get on to her, Feathers.
You see ’ow she treats me—me what never put
her away when she stole the tutsie, ’n’ never will,
s’help me.” The reference to the tutsie (verna-
cular for cat) was provoked by Minnie’s muff—a
skimpy, moth-eaten muff with bald patches—of
which she was rather proud.
“ I ’ope I got too much self-respec’ t’ have any-
thinkt’ say t’ them low larrikins,” said Minnie to
the nearest paster.
Mr. Green continued in this vein for some
weeks. He never came near Miss Silver without
favoring her with some trifle of banter, and his
remarks were personal—painfully so they might
have seemed to people of refinement. One after-
noon Minnie remarked, in a high-pitched,
thin voice, addressing nobody in particular
“If someone don’t know better ’n ter sing-
out after people in the street they’ll find
out/’ The speech was laboriously enig-
matic, but Chiller understood. Strange to
say, the young man had no reply,
There was an undercurrent of sadness in
the Bantam’s greeting to Miss Silver next
morning.
“’Ere she is agin. Ain’t she saucy?” he
said.
“ Phew ! ” said Miss Silver, disdainfully.
“ Oh, mother, she bit me ! ” Chiller
sparred, side-stepped the town-traveller, hit
him in the wind, and then danced a shuffle or
two ; but it was evident to Feathers that the
bloom was passing from the young man’s
assurance.
Not long after this the packer came upon
Chiller and Miss Silver behind one of the
stacks. Minnie was supercilious ; Chiller was
protesting almost pathetically.
“Oh, Isay, Min, get off me face. Ain’t I
sweet with yer ! Ain’t’ Chiller discovered
Feathers at this point, and fell into a low-
comedy vein. He feinted at the attack,
ducked in, and put in some effective half-arm
blows on a bundle of fruit-bags ; but Feathers
was not deceived. Miss Silver went perkily
up the room. Certainly the courtship was
progressing.
After this there was an unmistakably
pathetic appeal in Chiller’s banter ; and Miss
Silver, understanding her advantage, accen-
tuated her haughtiness. She was weazened,
and plain, and miserably dressed, and in
all probability had never had an admirer
before, but the most disdainful beauty
could not have assumed more airs towards a
hapless suppliant. Indeed, at this stage
Miss Silver’s performance was an ex-
quisite piece of comedy. Despite her dis-
dain, instinct prompted the girl to preen
herself with silly little bits of ribbon and
scraps of lace, and a small bunch of second-
hand cherries and a turkey feather were
added to the quaint collection in her battered
hat. Her scorn for Chiller was rapidly work-
ing upon what strange sense of humor the
Beauties possessed. She put herself to no
little trouble to display it. She w r ent out of
her way to meet the Bantam in order to
avoid him with unspeakable disdain. She
talked at Chiller in a loud, reedy voice.
“There’s someone wliat’s always follerin’
someone about in a way what he orter be ashamed
of hisself, knowin’ he ain’t wanted,” she cried.
“ Better lay poison for him,” said the Fat Girl.
“Ifs yer fatal beauty, Spadger,” suggested
Kitty Coudray. “Cut yer’air ’n’sit in the sun
till you freckle up,’n’ then the man might give
you a rest. ”
Another paster asked if the villain who still
pursued her was an aide-de-camp or a rich squatter.
“Oh, ’e knows what ’e is well enough,”
answered Minnie, shrilly, “ ’n’ ’e better mind
’isself, that’s all.”
Chiller had no answer to make to these insinua-
tions. They left him depressed. He went
about his work quietly. He had abandoned the
boxing-class in the lift corner, and showed a
marked dislike for the society of Feathers,
Goudy, and the ribald printers. Even Billy the
Bov was losing respect for him, and cast painful
reflections up and down the stairs.
“Buck-up,” said Billy, “there's lots better ’n
ner in the dust-box.’’
Chiller declined to buck-up. Minnie piped
something to the effect that she would disdain to
be “ found drownded with a bloke what done-up
’is ’air dead leary, ” and next morning the elaborate
festoons had disappeared from Chiller’s brow,
and his hair was parted with the oily precision
characteristic of Sunday-school superintendents
and reputable young barbers.
“They’s scrougers what think they’s jist the
lolly in a red tie,” piped Minnie, “but they
ain’t respectible, if yer arsk me.” Chiller aban-
doned his red tie. He put away the proud bob-
tailed coat with the buttons on it, because Minnie
said acridly of all wearers of such coats: “It
shows what they are—lurchers ’n rats, the lot iv
’em.” He lowered his heels for the same reason,
and discarded a black-and-white sweater that lie
had prized very highly, because Minnie thought
sweaters suggested disreputable sporting connec-
tions. But poor young Mr. Green’s courtship was
not visibly advanced bj? these concessions. Minnie
Silver remained supercilious.
“Oh, Min, come off,” said Chiller, in sad ex-
postulation.
“Speak ter ver equals!” sniffed the little
folder.
“Give’s a charnce, won’t yer?” persisted
Chiller, following her up.
Minnie gathered up her dingy skirt, pointed
her nose straight at the rafters, and to use Chil-
ler’s own expressive phrase, “ laid him out cold.”
Half-an-hour later, speaking from her place at the
board, and addresing the whole factory, Miss
Silver cried :
“If people ’angs round other people’s ’ouses of
nights it’s their own look-out if the police gets
spoke to.”
Chiller Green actually blushed. A few minutes
later, when the Bantam was busy at the machines,
and well within range, Minnie said to Miss
Twentyman
“Seen me out with Mr. Eddie, Sunday, didn’t
ver. Sis ? ’E’s a gentleman, ’e is. Knows how t’
behave’•-.Gets ’is quid a week et Goosie’s,
solderin’jam-tins, ’n ax'se every year. ’E don’t
’ave no truck with no low figh'tnr soougers, ’e
don’t.”
Mr. Green did not blush this time, but a light
came into his eye that augured ill for Mr. Eddie,
of Goosie’s jam-factory. On the morning of the
second day, Minnie was extremely caustic in her
comments on some person or persons of pugna-
cious quality.
“ Them what ’its them what is too good for them
will be made to pay for it, so they better mind
out,” she said. Chiller growled a bad expression,
and Miss Silver continued moralising. “It’s
somethin’ if a young lady can’t walk down the
street with a friend what’s a gentleman, without
’im bein’ dealt with, an’ ’is nose punched. But
what I sez is, there’s a law for the likes.”
Chiller got a day off to attend his aunt’s funeral,
and Feathers discovered in the suburban depart-
ment of an evening paper an intimation that one
James Green had been fined £2, with the alterna-
tive of a week’s imprisonment, for a grievous and
unprovoked assault on a Mr. Henry Eddie in the
public street.
Next evening, Chiller said to Feathers, “ I’m
slingin’ it, blokey. Goin’ back ter ther trade.”
“But I thought barrer-pushin’ was a game for
gazobs.”
“ Oh, ole Spats can’t expect me ter go on muckin’
round his fact’ry fer seventeen-’n’-a-tizzy. I’m
thinkin’ o’ gettin’ married.”
“ Gar-rn ! ”
“ Ya-a-a-a-s.” Chiller sparred a bit, danced a
step or two, and walked off singing. “She’s onlee

a vvuckin’ girl, no friends ’as she,” but his old
spirit was lacking.
* * * *
Chiller left. In two months, Minnie left.
About a year later Feathers said to Beuno, the
“ Who’d yer think I seen, Sundee ? Th’ Bantant
’n’ ’or nibs.”
“What! Spadger?”
“Ya-as. They ’ad a pramberlater. There was
a pincher in it. Chiller was pushin’ it. ’
“Good enough for ’im,” said the relentless
Ben no.

FAIR GAME.
“ Where did you get your
wife, Jimmy? ”
“ Caught her in the scrub.”
ALONG the cluttered piers they range
Where ships lie in a cluster,
Hearts thrilling with the zest of change
And love of ocean’s lustre.
They wait and wait at the painted sides
Till the dusk falls over the sober tides,
Then take their chance of a mate who chides
And a skipper who’s all bluster.
If the grey sea’s caught them in her clutch
With deceits and soft allurings,
They will not worry overmuch,
Whatever the grim endurings.
And a hungering time in a noisome hole,
Where the dark creeps in on a youthful soul,
Is soon forgot in the shake and roll
When a ship’s free of her moorings.
They ship by night at a London dock,
And at Teneriffe we land them ;
Where the idling island Spaniards mock
Till it’s downright hard to stand them.
Oh, it’s down in the dirt for a sea-lorn lad
When the tongue is foreign, and all is b id,
And never a chance of a ship’s to be had,
So we feel right sorry we’ve banned them.
They slip aboard at Circular Quay
When the quartermaster’s dreaming ;
And we set them ashore in Albany
With its pilot lights a-gleaming,
But they hang around on the wind-swept pier,
And they moan to a skipper who will not hear,
For ships are few and the waiting’s drear.
And the waves of the Bight are creaming.
They wait and watch with a hope to win
Again to a place of hiding,
And grinning sailor-men smuggle them in
With a kindly word of guiding ;
Each one remembers the time he had
When just a ludicrous sea-fond lad,
And knows that the crusted mate is glad,
Whatever his language chiding.
For this is the vagabond style of old
That led on the brave sea-rovers,
And the stowaway’s of a useful mould,
As many a mate discovers ;
So they work him hard for a voyage through,
Till he earns a berth with the weathered crew
As one of the beautiful, untrue
Ocean’s accepted lovers.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
wedding festivities of Christine,
daughter of Karl Beitkrentz, in the old
days of the Darling Downs, would have
spread over days; but now has come the day of
the cow, and the cow is a jealous lord. So the
wedding was between morning and evening
milkings.
And when Karl came to make the speech called
for at such times, the cow again obtruded. “ I
tank everybody for coming here to see me lose der
best.hant mit cows ve hat left. Der man is lucky
dot gets her so kvick. I tank you again, unt sit
me down.”
The speech touched everybody present, for
they mostly were dairy -men and women. There
followed some singing and a little drinking ; not
too much, for all present had the evening milking-
on their minds. The last to sing was Karl. He
sang, “ Was is das Deutschen Yaterland ? ” He
was not allowed to sing the whole of that beautiful
dirge, for Mrs. Karl interrupted, “Karl, the cows
are cornin’ to the yard.” The guests, including
the bride and bridegroom, thereupon got away
as quickly as possible. The cows were calling.
Later on—after Karl’s cows had been milked—
he and I forgathered. Karl sighed deeply as he
fell into his chair.
“You had a real good time to-day ? ” I began.
“ Ach, yaw ; bud—” he shook his head sadly.
“ I suppose you will miss Christine ?”
“Yaw, I vill miss Christine all right.- She is
der fourt an’ best, an’ der last von of der girls, unt I
haf only fife boys more left. I vill miss Christine.
She vos der best milker in der house. I don’d
altogedder know vat me unt Therese vill do midout
her. Fifty cows to milk efery day twice, feed to
get, milk to go to der creamery efery day, unt
only me unt der boys unt Therese to do it all.
Id’s too bad alretty. My life is fool on droubles.”
“ Troubles? I thought that you were the most
fortunate”
“ Dat is not zo, younk feller. You listen to me,
unt I vill dell you somedings. Hellup yourselluf. ”
He passed me the bottle, and I filled my glass.

someding ferry bat. Hellup yourselluf. Nein ?
Den vy do you laf, eh?”
I was laughing, for I had heard Johnny Ryan's
story myself at the creamery. It appeared that
Paddy, his eldest boy, had “lifted” a young cow
and sold it. He had quarrelled with one of his
friends, and the friend had informed on him ; so
Paddy got 12 months, being released under the
First Offenders Act. Johnny Ryan was deploring
the degeneracy of the native-born, and quoted his
own son in illustration. “There’s me own bye,
Paddy,” he said; “his own mate, Con Cregan,
informed on him, the blaggard. Paddy’s been
out those three weeks now, an’ the dliirty low
informer’s alive yet. Don’t tell me the native s
any good afther that.”
“ Vy do you laugh ven you shoult be zorry for

asked. “ How you like to be called Dutchy by

laugh again, alretty, I vill ”
“Here now, you, Karl, come to bed. Ye’ve
dhrunk just enough. Ye’ll have to be up bright
an’ early to-morry, now Christina’s gone. Come
now.” It was Teresa. Karl got up obediently
and stumbled off, but turned at the door, and
said, “Don’d you laugh at me no more, younk
feller. lam Von Beitkrentz, unt”
“Be off wid you,” said Teresa, “or I’ll”
Karl disappeared, with a lurch, and she turned to
me. “ An’ now, like a good man, do ye go off to
bed, too. Himself will be all right to-morry. It’s
bin a wearin’ day. So good-night to ye.”
I went to bed, to waken long before sunrise. It
was raining hard. Apparently everybody in the
house was up and about, and above the rattle of
the rain-drops on the iron roof of the house I could
hear Karl’s troubles calling appealingly from the
milking-yard. I turned over for another snooze,
and dreamt that I heard a voice say, “And the
Lord plagued the people because they made the
calf and worshipped it.” I knew in my dream
that the calf was female, and had grown into a
Cow.

“Melroyd”: “Talking about dogs’ saga-

hut on th’ creek, an’ ’e’d trained ’is retriever
‘ Spud ’ t’ go t’ th’ pub. every night for ’is
(Jerry’s) threepennerth o’ beer. One night, two
scrub-cuttin’ blokes was sufferin’ pretty bad, an’
they spotted the dog cornin’ erlong with til’ billy

old Spud comes back, an’ we’ll collar th’ blessed

an’ passes on, an’ when ’e comes back, they coaxed
’im, an’ ’ooked away with th’ billy. They thort it

The Vanished Vision.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT times, I see tar over sea
A sunset scene serenely blest,
An ancient port, and on its quay
A blue-eyed people gazing West.
Is it some Danish ship of war,
With carven prow and sails’of snow.
r J hat hither draws from realms afar
lo work the island people woe ?
Nay, nay, the vision in the West
Speaks not of slayer or of slain ;
It is the dream desired and blest,
It is Hy-Brasil come again.
With parted lips and bended knees
They watch it flowering like a rose ;
And silence reigns along the quays,
What while the palaced wonder grows.
A fisher fleet is on the bay,
No net is cast, nor rope is hauled ;
The herring shoals may go their way,
The herring fishers sit enthralled. ’
Hy-Brasil burns with dome and tower,
A city swathed in golden mist;
On street and square falls down a shower
Of pearly lights and amethyst.
And as its temple-tops take fire,
Along the quay there runs a prayer :
0 heart s desire, O soul’s desire,
0, that our feet might wander there.”
Gold-towered Hy-Brasil drifts away,
The turrets perish in the sky,
I he rich lights vanish, and the grev,
Great sea begins to moan and sigh.
O Watchers, when the vision failed,
And darkness filled the sunset skies,
And all the empty west was veiled,
Mow was it with your dreaming eyes ?
Was earth as earth was ere ye saw
The Isle Resplendent in the West ?
Was wealth as potent still to draw
Your hearts, as ever, in the quest ?
How could ye milk your kine at eve ?
How could ye sing, or sit and hear ?
How could ye comb the flax and weave ?
Was not the vision always near ?
Came ye not always to the coast ?
Saw ye not sometimes, beauty-mazed,
A sunset cloud that seemed the ghost
Of those far towers that seaward blazed ?
When piled-up seas of foam and surf
With call and cry made loud the hours,
Saw ye not glowing in the turf
Hy-Brasil’s golden domes and towers ?
O Dream that passed ! Ye saw it whole.
O Vision never more to be !
O craving of the cheated soul
That seeks to see but may not see !
No more, no more ’neath any skies,
At any hour, by quay or cape.
Shall we behold with lifted eyes
High-towered Hy-Brasil gather shape.

Three Ishmaels.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OF the three tired men who were
trudging towards a farm-house, Sam was
melancholy, Dick was cheerful, Tommy
was anything.
Cheer up, Sammy, we’ll get somethin’ t’ eat,
and p’raps a job, too, at this cocky’s,” said Dick.
Of course, said Tommy, “we can’t go on
f’r ever doin’ nuthin’.”
“We’ve gone three weeks doin’as much, any-
ways,” said Sammy, shaking his head lugubri-
ously. Half-a-dozen dogs rushed out at the men,
and began making feints at snapping at their
heels; but, with the caution of experience, they
kept outside kicking distance.
“If we’d drove up in a buggy they’d ’ave
barked joyously,” moaned Sammy, sneaking close
behind Dick. “But, cos we’s poor, they’re treatin’
us like their boss will.” He nearly shed tears.
Dick threw a stick at the nearest dog, which
went howling away. They followed the dog into
the empty yard, and the noise brought out a half-
dressed man, who looked as if he had been dis-
turbed from a heavy sleep.
“Good day, Mr. York,” said Dick.
“Who ’it me dog?” asked Mr. York, drowsily.
“Which dog ? ” asked Dick, innocently. York’s
half-shut eyes opened a little.
“The dog that yelped,” he said. They were
all noisily barking and jumping round him. He
turned and kicked one of them half-across the
yard.
“ Who ’it me dog?” he repeated.
“You jus’ kicked it,” said Dick, evasively.
‘ ‘ That ain’t ’ittin’ it. ” He kicked another after
the first, and it landed on the skirt of a fat woman
just as she was emerging from the kitchen door.
She staggered and kicked it back again. It and
all the other dogs fled at sight of her. She stared
at the strangers with vacant, bovine curiosity
Two children followed and clung to her skirts
while a bigger boy edged guiltily away with his
hand behind his back. He also stared at the men
with an expression the exact replica of his
mother’s.
“ What does them fellers want ? ” she asked her
husband.
“ Work,” answered Dick.
“ What can ye do ? ” asked York.
“Grubbin’,” answered Sam.
“Fencin’,” answered Dick.
“ Harvestin’,” answered Tommy.
SAME THING.
“ My husband says my lobster-salad is a dream."
"The dear man. Mine says it’s a nightmare."
He was the biggest man of the three, and had
visions of a comfortable ride on a reaper. He had
never driven one before. The boy absent-mindedly
drew a scone from behind his back and began to
eat it. His mother saw it—so did one of the dogs
which had returned. It was quicker than Mrs.
York, and got it. The boy got a licking. The
two younger children chased the dog. Tommy
slipped his swag on to the ground and sat on it.
“ Two to one on the dog, Boss,” he said.
‘‘Done, and in shillins’,” said York, becoming
suddenly wide awake. The yard was surrounded
on three side 3 by buildings, with the open side
facing the house. The youngsters tried to prevent
the dog passing the wings. The dog made a rush
to pass the right end, but was stopped by a deftly-
thrown piece of firewood. He tried the other
wing, was intercepted there, and scampered
howling-back to a corner, hanging manfully
on to the scone. One of the youngsters made a
rush, grabbed the scone, and managed to pull
away a quarter of it. With a hurried gulp, the
dog swallowed the rest, nearly choking in the
effort.
tt ve won • ” shouted York triumphantly.
“No, you ain’t,” shouted Tommy. “ The do°-
got the best of the bargain.”
Hi> y°u brat,” yelled York, “ drop that
scone ! ” The youngster gulped exactly like the
dog, then fled. York fell asleep again.
“Which o’ you fellers’it me dog?” he asked
drowsily. Sammy glanced sadly down his nose,
and remarked with mournful sympathy :
“ The pore thing was runnin’ at us, an’ ’it ’is
nose agin a stick.”

There was a long silence, which Dick interrupted
with :
“Got any work, boss?” York brightened up
again.
“I want a man wot’ll get up at daybreak, milk
the cows, light the fire, carry the water, turn the
mangle, swish the buckets, clean the stables,
watch the kids, hoe the tunnips ” .
“Nuss the baby, do the washin’, clean the pig-
stye, chop the feed, cut the grass, trim the flowers,
go ter church on Sunday,” interjected Tommy.
“ How much a week ? ” interrupted Dick.
“Ten bob and yer tucker?” answered York,
looking doubtfully at Tommy.
My pore mother ! ” murmured Sammy.
“ What’s the matter with yer mother?” asked
*ork, suspiciously.
“He’s got to support his mother on what he
earns, ’ replied Dick, sadly.
“Pore chap 1 Tell yer what, I’ll give yer all
ten bob a week; then yer can club together an’
elp his mother. ”
Wot about keepin’ ourselves?” they asked
together.
Ye re a nice lot ? Sure ye can ’elp a mate’s
mother in distress.” The men looked at each
other dubiously. Then Dick nodded. Tommy
chuckled joylessly. Sammy openly wiped a tear
from his ear.
“Ye can sleep in the barn, nut don’t smoke
there, ’ said York, turning away.
Things looked more rosy after the best meal
they had had for three weeks; and when they
snuggled down in the warm hay—after a good
smoke—Tommy remarked :
“I think my bet got us this job; it was a touch
o genius.”
“Bah! my pore dear mother did it,” said
,ammy, derisively. “She’s bin a useful ole party
before.”
“If she ain’t been worth more’n ten bob a week
to yer, she wasn’t up to much,” said Dick. Then
they turned in and snored blissfully.
• • * «
It seemed that they had fallen asleep barely
a minute when they heard a thundering on the
wall of the barn, and recognised the voice of York
roaring, “Get up ! ” (bang !) “ Are ye ” (bang !)
“ goin’ ter ” (bang !) “ sleep there all day ? ” (bang !
bang ! ! bang !! !) They scrambled out of the
stidtv. The grey light of faint dawn was just
peeping through the chinks. The cows had
already been run in by a timid-eyed girl of 14, who
cantered off when they appeared. The boy of the
scone was already seated milking his stolid cow
stolidly, and they found he could milk a cow and
a half to their one. Then they were set to hoeing
till breakfast, which was over just as the sun
peeped above the horizon. After that they were
told the harvesting was to begin as soon as the
horses were ready, which implied that they were
to get them ready.
Tommy mounted the binder and started away
with a jerk which snapped the trace-chain. York
swore and told him to mend it. Tommy’s ideas
were crude in the matter, so he snipped the two
bottom wires out of the nearest fence. York was.
looking at something else at the time. The trace
mended, Tommy started off more gently; the
repairs held for 100 yards, then pulled out
Tommy wired the trace together again, perspiring
profusely. Sam and Dick followed, stooking; in
a few minutes they were perspiring profusely in
their turn, for the crop was a heavy one, and the
machine threw out the sheaves every five feet
York sat on a fence watching drowsily, slowly
pulling at his pipe. In a few more minutes they
saw him fall off. Dick ran to him, thinking he
was dead, and found he had only fallen asleep.
He walked quietly back to Tommy, who had
stopped the machine, and said, “We can have a
spell too.’’ The horses next fell asleep, then
Sammy, with his head on a sheaf. Dick and
Tom did likewise on the platform of the reaper.
They were awakened suddenly by hearing York
yelling in a furious temper ; a flock of sheep had
crawled through where Tommy had cut the wires.
The rest of the morning was spent in chasing
them out. At dinner York wrote out a notice
offering a reward for the conviction of the person
who had cut his wires. Tommy said it was a.
blackguardly thing to do. Things went smoothly
after dinner, and they worked till it was too dark
to see the crop. Then they all shambled weariedly
in to tea. Mrs. York was apparently made of
cast-iron, for she looked exactly as they left her
in the morning. Sammy’s sad face attracted her
sympathy, and she piled the food on his plate
mountainously, under the firm conviction that it
was an infallible cure for sorrow. It melted him
inwardly, and a tear trickled slowly down his
nose, glistening like a diamond on the point for a
moment, then falling with a gentle splash on the
table.
“ Pore malm. What ails ye ? ”
“Yer remind me so much o’my dear, absents
mother.” Another tear chased the first, amdihies
gurgled a little. Dick glanced warningly at Mrs.
York, shaking his head negatively, which she
understood as a signal not to take any notice of
Sam’s grief. Later Tommy told Mrs. York in secret
how Sammy was a gentleman, down in the world
through the injustice of a harsh stepfather, who
was jealous of his stepson’s affection for his
mother; and hinted also at a title. “But you
see, a gent makes no store by mere names, so
Sammy ’as come to Australia ter make a fortune!
by ’is own unaided efforts, an’ a name which. ”ei
didn’t get as a accident o’ birth, an’ to prove toi
an unbelievin’ world that a feller can be a man im
spite o’ bein’ born an effete lord.”
“Ain’t lords men, then?” asked Mrs. York:,
wonderingly.
“Some,” said Dick, shaking his head know-
ingly ; “but it’s ’ard ter be a man when you’re
surrounded by a lot o’ sycophants.” The last
word convinced Mrs. York, who thought it was
a kind of bunyip. It conveyed to her a world of
suggestion of the mystery and tragedy of high life.
After tea she went and offered Sam the use of a
room in the house.
“ What yer givin’us ? ” asked Sam, disrespect-
fully.
“ I unnerstan’,” said Mrs. York. “ You’re too
proud to be beholden to anyone.” She sighed
sympathetically, and left him with increased
respect. At breakfast the following morning
there was a cloth on the table, also a few flowers..
At tea, in the evening, Mrs. York had brought,
out her best crockery, which was of a gorgeous,
pattern. She beamed benignantly at Sam. He-
looked suspiciously at Dick, and made insulting-
remarks to him afterwards, but learnt nothing of;
the cause of the change in Mrs. York.
The third morning Mr. York began to splutter,-,
when he found the plated cruet on the table.
“Are ye daft, wife? What’s the meaning off
this ? ”
“ Hush, mahn ; can’t ye behave yersilf in front of
a gintleman ? ” York glanced round the room im
search of a gentleman, then looked at his wife;,
with a sudden fear in his eyes. Sam shook his
head sadly, which seemed to confirm York’s fear,
for he furtively watched his wife all through the
meal.
“Did ye notice anything wrong with the
missus ? ” he asked when they were outside.
“Was there ever anythin’ wrong with her
ancestors ? ” asked Sam.
“ What do yer mean ? ”
“Was there any—any —insanity in ’er fambly?”’
“My Gawd ! So you noticed it, too.”
“ Bear up, old feller,” said Sam, sadly. “‘lit
may be on’y a passin’ attack. ’As she ever’ad
one before ? ”
“I ain’t seen one since we was married, 1G
year agone.” York sat heavily down on a stump,
and, placing his head between his hands, rocked
himself to and fro miserably.
“You an’ yer mates go on with yer work. I’ll
stay with the missus a bit. It may quiet ’er, in i
case she tries ter ’arm the ehilder.” Sam went:
and told his mates the fears of York. Dick’s face
nearly doubled its normal width. Sam called him i
a “ callis brute fer laughin’ at the troubles cf ’is:
feller-creatures.” When York got inside, he:
heard his wife saying to his timid-eyed daughter,.
“’E said I was like ’is mother, an’ she a real:
duchess. ”
Dick had driven round the crop twice, when!
above the rattle of the reaper-blade he heard a:
distant bellow. Looking back from his elevatedl
perch he saw York running towards them, waving
a gun, and out of the jumble of sounds he was
making they caught the words —“ sniveilin’calf,”
“cow,” “murder.” As he got nearer his sen-
tences became distinct. “ I’ll shoot the ’og!”
“He’s after you, I think, Sam,” said Dick,
casually. Just then York corroborated the state-
ment by pointing his gun at Sam, who fled like a
hunted kangaroo. y
“ There ’e is, dad,” said the urchin of the scone.
“Sool ’im, pup.” The dogs promptly set after
York, and circled round him till he fell over one.
When he got up, swearing savagely, he saw Sam
scrambling thfough the fence and fired his gun at
him. Fortunately Sam was 500 yards away, but
the report made him fairly leap along. When
York vanished into the scrub along the creek after
Sam. Dick turned to Tommy, and said
“ I don’t s’pose we can leave ’im in the lurch ?
“ Nope. I ’ll get our swags an’ meet yer down
the road.”
Mrs. York could never disbelieve the story of
Sam being a lord. As the months lengthened
into years she told the tale with increasing con-
viction, always ending it by saying how his lord-
ship had said she reminded his. lordship of his
mother. Even York began to think there might
be something in it, till ac last it became a family
tradition. m

THROUGH old Coolgardie the tramp of
horsemen—
Clink of hobble and click of shoe—
Riding out to the bush by Norseman,
Hiding in from the reefs of Cue ;
tnd words that spread with the horseman’s tread :
~ ou id you reap the harvest the ages sow ?
grave hearts and stout, ride out, ride out!
There is gold where the bull-oaks grow ! ”
grey nor’-westers, their desert-travel
Written deep in each sunburnt face,
Tell their stories of golden gravel;
Hard-won nuggets are spent apace.
And the word goes far in each thronging har
Till the last lamp flickers, the last rounds go :
“Rideforth, ride forth, by east and north ;
There is gold where the bull-oaks grow ! ”
Old mates meeting by new-made waysides,
/Qh! the merry miles on the Darling Downs !)
Greet again in the rush by Raeside’s,
Passing word of the Queensland towns.
And this is told in the talk of gold,
By the granite rock where the camp-fires glow ;
“ Where the ranges run to the rising sun
There is gold where the bull-oaks grow ;
“If we pack at dawning, high noon will find us
Hiding through where the red hills break ;
Where the pads run east we will leave behind us
The marble isles of the Ninety Lake.
Where the black pines stand we will spurn the
sand,
Our hoofs will scatter the flints below.
East, east to ride with each morning tide ;
There is gold where the bull-oaks grow 7! ”
Old mate of mine, do you hear them calling,
The windy oaks on the desert rise ?
Grey-green and golden their leaves are falling—
Falling deep where the red gold lies.
Where the gullies spread in their widening bed,
And the rich leads follow the waters’ flow,
By ounce and ’weight, in the ragged slate;
There is gold where the bull-oaks grow ?
There are plains sequestered and blue hills
hidden—
(Old mate, we are not of the city’s brood);
No hoofs have traversed, no horsemen ridden,
Where the bull-oaks whisper in solitude.
Where the bronzewing flies deep down it lies
(Oh! the ringing dish when the big slugs show);
And my heart is fain for the bush again—
Far out, far out, where the bull-oaks grow !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HERR MICHELFURTER was a Ger-
man, or an Austrian, or something Centro-
European, but he took pride in calling
himself a Briton, and so the boys called him
Mickey ” for short.
I first met Mickey around Cooktown way. He
m then collecting “specimens” for some
southern museums—
bugs, scorpions, lizards,
snakes, and anything
dse that he thought
was worth money. He
employed (irregularly)
,l few blacks to catch
"things” for him—
■nostly snakes. Mickey
was very proud of his
sr >ake-handling powers,
Bnd Uo ed to assert that
10 could mesmerise
' de r vildest beast dat
o 'er vhas.” He was a
“ttle podgy man, with
a placid beery face,
r,nd had hair all blow-
lnK about his head like
a hen’s mane.
One day a blaek-
,elow came to the
hotel where we both
paying, and yab-
d something to

hl °h seemed to ex-

“A piano-case?”
“Yes, I mesmerise

trance, und keep him
in dot trance so long
as I like—for sefen
years if I likes. My
young vrendt,” added
Mickey, solemnly,
“ you don’t got to
know the mighty
segrets of nature, but
by-and-by ycu shall
learn some of dems
from me.”
Herr Michelftirter ac-
tually proceeded to
mesmerise the croc,
before my eyes. Stand-
ing close to its muzzle,
his red eyes seemed to
shoot flame into the
eyes of the reptile,
which viciously “ bark-
ed no other word is
quite suitable to the
cry of the brute—at
him, and tried to snap
at his head. Then
Herr Mickey gave it a
clout or two on the
snout with a waddy,
and again stared at it
intently.
The crocodile seemed
to become quite dazed.
It quieted down, gave
a sickly leer, and lay
at Herr Michelfiirter’s
feet.
“ Shleep ! ” said
Mickey.
The croc, slept.
“Dura over on your
pack.”
The croc, tied fore
and aft as he was,
wriggled himself into

with his lashings, but he got on to his back
and lay upside-down—a humorous, sickly,
devilish sight, sloping his head towards the
Herr, with the most sheepish lover’s look you
could imagine—on a crocodile.
“Untie dem lashings,” said the Herr.
“You’ll excuse me,” I interrupted, hastily;
“ I’ll get u]s a tree while you finish the circus.”
“You vhas a vools, yung man,” answered
Mickey, rebukingly. “ Dot repdile dere vhas now
gombledely onder my gondrol. You go oop a
tree ; I dura him on to you. Now, den, help me
undo dose ropes.”
The niggers had long since bolted.
“ But look here, Mickey; you don’t suppose you
and I can carry that beast into Cooktown, do
you?”
“Vhas I looneys, dink you? No, I vhas not pig
enough vools to suppose I gan lift half-a-ton, but
I could if I choose make dot beast carry us into
down. But I don’t shoose to be run in for a tan-
gerous nuisance shoost yet. I haf gondrol of his

vhas. I shtay py my pet till den, in case oder
grockodiles come und pay him a visit.”
All this time we—the Herr gaily and excitedly,
and I with fear and trembling—were busy un
knotting the ropes, and soon the reptile was free.
There he lay, ugly and comatose, with paws at
half-cock, so to speak, and his pale, greenery-
yallery, turtley-looking belly upwards. Herr
Mickey sat quietly down upon it, filled his pipe,
and invited me to take a seat beside him. I de-
clined.
“Veil you go, den, and pe pack ash quick ash
doo shticks,” said Mickey.
I went. Just didn't Igo !
* * * *
It all happened as Mickey had foretold. We
got the crocodile into a packing-case, housed him
there in the back-yard of the hotel for a few days,
then took him by steamer down to Melbourne.
Mickey used to often remove the lid, and some-
times made some fresh “passes,” but the reptile
never showed a sign, and might have been dead,
save that he continued as fresh as such an animal
ever is.
To a secluded retreat near Caulfield,
Mickey took the crocodile “ to train him.”
By this time I had become thoroughly in-
terested in the reptile, and was formally ap-
pointed as Mickey’s assistant on a salary of
“half-share of der profits, vlien ve makes
’em.”
Away at the far end of the small back pad-
dock of this retreat ran a creek, and our first
work was to dig a tank on our land—a water-
hole, in fact, with a small canal track from the
creek.
The crocodile had now been in a trance six
weeks and two days, and Herr Mickey one morn-
ing declared “it vhas times to pring his senses
back.” So he proposed that “ve take a valk.”
Out we went. Every dog Mickey met he would
lasso and give him to me to lead. We got six
and came back.
“ Going to give these dogs to the crocodile when
he awakes?” I asked.
‘' Do you vhant me to kill mein pet ? Dot crea-
ture haf not had food for six veeks, und a square
meal would kill him. I have to give him some-
dings dot don’t vorry his suspended und veak
digestion, und, at der same time, so concentrated
mit shtrength, dot it bring him round at vonce.”
“Whisky,” I suggested,
“Veil, dot might not do him harm eider, but I
dink over dot some oder times. Vhiskey is—
vhiskey.”
“ Well, what are the dogs for ?”
“To make beef-tea.”
Herr Michelfiirter slaughtered the dogs and
boiled them down in a big boiler—all that night,
and all the next day, and finally turned out a dog-
soup that for strength would beat any Liebig
extract.
“Now, den, young mans, ve vake Shtrabismus.”
We had decided to christen the alligator
Strabismus.
The Professor made some rapid passes,
jabbed a sharp lance just under an “armpit,”
bringing blood, gave the croc, a slap on the side
of the jaw, and—the huge unwieldy brute opened
his eyes, gasped, snapped his jaws, gasped again,
and lay still, looking at us very much as a kan-
garoo-dog will when he curls himself at your feet
after he has been round a fatiguing hunt.
“Veil, Shtrabismus, how you feel? Try some
of dis. Here, open dot'gateway of pearls vonce
more.”
Asunder went the jaws, and down slushed a
bucketful of dog-tea—warm and plentifully red-
peppered.
“I herepy ghristens you Shtrabismus, py vich
name you vill always answer ven called upon py
us, und no von else.”
The croc, sneezed. Mickey declared that
was his way of saying “ Amen.” I said it was the
cayenne pepper in the soup.
“Now, let me show you your quarders,” said
Mickey. “ Get ofer ” —and he assisted the reptile
right-side-up with his foot—“und vollow me.
Dot’s your vater-bower ” —pointing to the dam—
“und inside this paddock is your blay-grount,
und your drill-grount. Ven I vistle, so!”
whistling three notes —“ den I vant you, und vot-
ever I pring you, dot’s for you to eat. Put don’t
touch none of our vittles, or you go to zleep for
ever, quick. Now, berhaps, you like a vash, so I
leaf you, but in half-an-hour I pring you a broper
veed. Good-py for der present.”
* * * *
Days went by, and we both got attached to
Strabismus, who showed as much affection as in.
telligence. We had trained him to drag us round
the field in a low-wheeled car, to dance, to roll, to
laugh, to weep —real crocodile tears —all at given
signals, and he was learning to play euchre. We
admitted no visitors to our retreat. Mickey did
all the providoring ; coming home sometimes with
dogs, once with a calf, at other times with a foal, a
brood-mare, etc. T asked no questions, nor did
Strabismus.
One day Mickey went out and did not return.
Late in the evening I read in the Herald about a
“ tram accident to Herr Michelfiirter,” who was
taken to the hospital. Next day I went to see
him. He was badly splintered. He hurriedly
whispered instructions to me respecting Strabis-
mus. I accepted the task with misgivings, but
with a fierce resolve to see my mate through.
“But what about money for provisions for
Strabismus ? ” I asked.
“ Money ? Do I efer got money ?” he hoarsely
gurgled. “ Shteal ’em. All sorts of live stock
will do.”
*•***•
I’ve been in charge of Strabismus ever since,
and I’m full up of the job. Michelfiirter went
back on me. He died in the hospital. I don’t
know enough of the mighty secrets of Nature to
catalept the crocodile again, or I’d do it to-
morrow and go and lose myself. I tried desertion,
but the alligator must be a mind-reader, for that
very morning he followed me through the house—
he had never, while awake, been in the building
before —out into the front garden, and would
doubtless have gone to the train with me had I
persisted. So I’ve got to stop and I’ve got to
feed him. The fact is, I myself never was much
of a mesmerist, and the crocodile mesmerises me.
Two sighs and a slobber always send me “off.”
Why he doesn’t eat me I don’t know.
I don’t dislike Strabismus, mind you. It’s the
food question that is troubling me. There is not
a dog within a three-mile circuit of this now.
People say there never was such an awful country
'for dogs to disappear out of. Fowls, calves, foals,
a horse or two —all, all have gone, and public sus- \
picion has fallen on me. But they can’t prove it,
that’s one comfort.
I coaxed a Chinaman pedlar indoors one day,
and whistled up Strabismus. The Chinee disap-
peared, baskets and all, and the crocodile was

glutted for three days. The Chow’s mates came
to look after him. I“ no sav'ee’d ” ; told them to
“look all about, Johnee, evelywheh”—and I
whistled. The Chinese went to the back to make
a thorough, search. They evidently intend to
make it very thorough, for they’re searching still.
At least, they haven’t come back past me.
A local clergyman called on me one day, and I
asked him to “ view the premises.” Now there is
a clerical scandal in my neighborhood ; for people
are saying he’s eloped with the Lady District
Visitor, who happened to call on me the very next
day with tracts. It appears that both the parson
and the lady are missing, and, of course, that
means ’Frisco and giddiness. Strabismus was sick
for a week after that outburst of religious fervor.
The sergeant of police called to “make in-
quiries.” He inquired at the fountain head, He.
too, has gone to Strabismus.
People begin to shun me. I’m beginning to feel
the gnawings of remorse. It seems to me I’m
getting close down to murder !
THE DIPSOMANIAC.
“ R.T. J.” : Interesting to note how tame
become the native birds when unmolested. There’s
quite a collection around this camp. Two red
lory parrots are rather shy customers, as are a
pair of peewits or mudlarks, but a couple of mag-
pies and two laughing-jacks turn up regularly at
meal-time. They probably watch the chimney for
a smoke-signal. The jacks will take a worm off
the end of the shovel, and the maggies are very
cheeky. T’other day, one of them prigged the
soap. There is also a Derwent jackass—presum-
ably a widower —who is quite confidential and
insinuating, and is easily coaxed inside, and there
are wattle-birds and yellow-breasted robins galore.

THE FIDDLER FOILED: A TALE OF THE PACIFIC.


The Poet’s Progress.
Mixed Verses
WRITTEN FOR “THE BULLETIN.”
WHEN young Corydon was twenty,
Poems wrote he long and warm,
Decked with epithets in plenty
Of his charmer’s dainty form.
Eyes and sighs in all his measures
Shone in syllables sublime ;
Hips and lips and other treasures
Made a catalogue in rhyme.
But the girl—when love was ended,
Wedded to a broker stout—
Looked upon those poems splendid
Only when her hub. was out.
Corydon, his passion burning
At a multitude of shrines,
Found, if money he’d be earning,
He must work on other lines.
So with frenzied zeal he enters
Cold Commercialism’s ground ;
Where the public int’rest centres,
There his verses may be found.
Day by day he shows Bent’s bounce’ll
Magnify the people’s wealth,
Butters up the City Council,
Vilifies the Board of Health.
Reid he proves a canker, blighting,
Reid a statesman, grand and pure,
Then makes fifteen shillings writing
Ads. belauding blood manure.
So he daily writes until his
Muse grows niggardly and slow,
Then he thinks of Amaryllis,
' And his poems long ago.
“ Dear old Am.,” he writes, “ I’m making
A suggestion you’ll excuse,
But those verses, with some faking,
Will make copy fit to use.”
Amaryllis answered, “ Cory.,
Herewith find each ode and lay.”
And a case upon a lorry
Was marked, “ 4/6 to pay.”
Corydon, in mood ecstatic,
Has another lease of -youth ;
Critics talk in tones emphatic
Of his sentiment and truth.
While his former sweatheart, striving
Every published verse to see,
Kisses sweet and vows reviving,
Softly murmurs, “ That is me ! ”

Sing Me No Song.
SING me no song in rusty rhyme,
I want a change ;
Sing me of something quaint, sublime,
In cadence strange;
If but the words fresh raptures bring,
I little care of what you sing.
Tell me no stories sanely true,
I know them all;
Tell me of something bright and new,
The old themes pall;
I little care what tales you tell
If they are but improbable.
Tell me fresh comets in the sky
Dark clouds enfold;
Tell me the wildest, grandest lie
Man ever told;
If you have nothing left to tell,
Say that the road is short to hell.
Even the best of us is nought
But Nature’s cud,
Seeking the changeless God we sought
Before the Flood.
Spin the world round an orbit new !
One day I’ll do as much for you !

BAMBOO.
Plantagenet and Dan.
ONE wears a motley coat of patches ;
He gets his meals in scraps and
snatches —
The proletariat man ;
He cleans the surface of his dish,
He drains his meagre pot or can;
That’s Dan.
The other, broadcloth wears in fashion,
For banquets lie’s acquired a passion—
The multi-million man ;
He never scrapes his dainty dish
Or hungers like the lowly clan
Of Dan.
Between these bits of protoplasm
There yawns a most prodigious chasm,
That nothing seems to span ;
Although the rich Plantagenet
From out Profundis swiftly ran,
Like Dan.
Though Nature, jealous of her lore,
Writes Pain across the mystic door
Where enters every man,
The gates of Birth, and Life, and Death
Are wholly Cosmopolitan,
And Dan
Comes in, goes out, and lives between,
By all the laws unknown, unseen,
That rule the Fatter Man ;
The gulf’s not Nature’s, but was set
Between him and Plantagenet;
And Dan—
He of the patchwork—by consent
Dug trenches of “environment,”
The mob from class to ban.
But, like a fool, the fleshpots left
The Big Man’s side ; and formed the clan
Of Dan.

The Magic Island.
NOT a wind o’er the still Pacific, not a light
on the dreaming bay,
Save the tapers the starmen carry as they follow
the bier of day.
And I crouch in the night concealed that the mad
mothers may not hear
What the murmuring sea-shell whispers as I hold
it against mine ear.
For it tells me a wondrous story that only the
mermen know,
And the souls of the little children who are
drowned in the pools below.
But the mothers are always listening—that they
haply may understand—
To the tales that the shells are telling to each
other upon the sand.
And they grasp at the mystic meaning as a child
at a dancing beam,
When it dapples the beach a moment in its play
on a sunflecked stream.
And the babbling sea-shell murmurs with its lips
to my eager ear—
Very close, for the mothers listen —very low, for
the waves might hear :
“In a moon in the far-off ages, ’neath the glitter
of stars like these,
Like the waste of a leafless garden lay the leagues
of the lone South Seas;
“Till the Grey Wizard said to the Ocean : ‘Oh,
barren thy fields, and bare
Is the waste of thy rolling acres—l shall plant me
an island there.’
“ And the veins of her throbbed and quivered with
the pulse of a life to be,
As the seed of the Wizard quickened in the womb
of the desert sea;
“ And it throve in the great Pacific, till the cliffs of
that sea-girt keep
Like the leaves of a flower unfolded in the soil of
the untilled deep.
“ And ’twas thus in the distant ages that the
chattering sea-fowl flew
O’er the shores of the magic Island as out of the
waves it grew.”
“ Said the Wizard Grey to the Ocean : ‘lt is far
from the prying ken
Of the tribes of the mean Earth people, of the
race of the pigmy men,
“‘Who would plunder her woods for cities, and
for ships with their merchandise.’
But the men of the earth are cunning, though they
may not be over wise.
“ So they built them a fair, great galley where the
bergs of the North Sea toss,
And they steered for the mystic Island by the
light of a strange white cross,
“ Till they swarmed oil her shining beaches, as an
eagle swoops on a crag,
And they builded a spacious city ’neath the. flaunt
of a flaring flag.
“ But the children came from the galley, and the
Grey Wizard watched their play,
As they paddled among the shallows on the sands
of a golden bay ;
“Until into the deeps he lured them, by the craft
of the sly green waves,
And with sinuous seaweed bound them in the
slime of the unsunned caves.
“ But the little earth men are valiant, and they
followed the children’s track—
And the Grey Wizard laughed in the breakers as
he baffled and hurled them back !
“ And he scoffed at the weak white swimmers, for
he swam as a sea-god swims—
And he marked how they stained the billows
when he scattered their puny limbs.
“ And the wailing of women reached him as he sat
where the waters slide—
As he dozed like a demon sated on the lap of the
dipping tide.
“ But some night in the unborn ages, in a mystical
moon to be,
Shall the beautiful island vanish in the depths of
the desert sea ;
“ And the mothers shall reach their kingdom when
the sea hath her own again,
And the Grey Wizard holds his treasure from the
tribes of the pigmy men.”
And this is the wond’rous story murmured into
my eager ear—
Very close, lest the mermen listen —very low, lest
the Waves might hear.
I shall whisper it to the mothers as they roam by
the booming bars,
Till their hollow eyes gleam and glisten with a
light that shall reach the stars.
For ’tis not but the sheen of waters that they see
when the sunsets flare,
But the locks of the little children and their glitter-
ing wave-wet hair.
And ’tis not but the stars’ reflection that they see
when the sunset cools,
But the eyes of the little children that are drowned
in the green sea pools.

The Bushman’s Book.
ALL roughly bound together
The red-brown pages lie
In red sirroco leather
With scored lines to the sky !
The Western suns have burned them,
The desert winds dog’s-eared,
And winter rains have turned them
With wanton hands and weird !
They flutter, torn and lonely,
Far out, like lost brown birds ;
The Western stockmen only
Can spell their wondrous words;
And gifted souls and sages
May gather round and look,
They cannot read the pages
That fill the Bushman’s Book !
But open, night and day-time,
It spreads with witching art
A picture-book of playtime
To hold the Bushman’s heart,
And learned in the lore of it,
And lessoned in its signs,
He reads the scroll, and more of it,
That lies between the lines.
He sees the well-filled purses,
From Abbot-tracks like wires,
And hears the deep-drawn curses
That dog the four-inch tyres !
He knows the busy super.
By worn hoofs flat as plates,
And me mounted trooper
By shod hoofs at the gates !
He knows the tracks unsteady,
Of riders “on the bust,” *
Of nags “knocked up already ”
By toes that drag the dust;
The “split” hoofs and the “quartered,”
He’ll show you on the spot,
And brumbies that have watered,
And brumbies that have not!
So, North and West o’ Westward,
Nor’-West and North again,
The Bush Book is the best word
Among the Western men ;
They find her lines and hail them,
And read with trusting eyes :
They know if old mates fail them,
The Bush Book never lies !

The Cattle-Train.
A GLARE on a wind-bound cloud !
And a locomotive’s beat,
Sounding heavy and loud,
Like a myriad marching feet.
Far down the cruel grade,
Her fire-doors swinging wide,
She toiled, till her fusillade
.Startled the mountain-side.
Slow and hard came the engine’s beat —
Like the tramp of a million marching feet.
Over the crest of the rise,
Her funnel spouting flame,
Like a battleship towing a prize,
The ponderous engine came.
Her driver’s face gleamed white
As he looked at his dragging load—
Blue lightning dazzled the night,
And the rain splashed on the road,
As the big, black engine topped the rise,
Like a conquering ship that towed a prize.
The thunder rolled afar,
The white horns tossed and shone;
To the clank of coupling-bar
The trucks went bumping on ;
A scramble, and then a cry
Showed where a beast was down—
Down in the dark, with a rolling eye
Turned to the night-sky brown.
So through the storm the train rolled on,
The bullocks moaned and the white horns shone.
Lords of the mountain-side,
Kings of the river-grass,
Gone is their splendid pride,
Soon did their glory pass.
Trucked in a cattle-train,
Dazed and hungered and parched—
Numbed with cold, and crazed with pain—-
Yet lords of the hills they marched,
Bellowing in their reckless pride
By brawling river and mountain side.
With thump and rattle of springs,
And clatter of under-gear,
The long train rumbles and swings
Till the tail-lights twinkle clear.
From the plain-lands down to the coast,
Over the hills between—
That is the engine’s boast—
That is where she has been
A thousand times ; and each time she brings
A load of quivering captured kings.
I saw a glare on a cloud
Afar, and the engine’s beat
Sounded suddenly loud
Like a myriad marching feet.
She was climbing another hill—
I heard her big wheels race—
And then, with a sudden thrill,
I thought of her driver’s face,
And it seemed, in that engine’s rhythmic beat,
I heard Humanity’s ruthless feet.

On the Road to Denistoun.
AND she told me that she missed me
That the days were short and grey ;
And she told me that she kissed me
In her dreaming every day ;
And she mentioned in her letter
That she hoped to see me soon
In the place where first I met her,
On the road to Denistoun.
When the paths are white with clover,
And the briar-blooms shining over,
And the weeping willows listen to the happy
river tune !
When the charlock weed is yellow
And the moon is bright and mellow,
Will I meet you in November on the road tc
Denistoun ?
As a smoke-wreath curling o’er mo
On a silver lamp-beam sails,
I can see the road before me
And the old and mossy rails ;
And the bleating flocks are grazing
O’er the pastures as you pass ;
And the mild-eyed cattle gazing
At their shadows on the grass.
And the bright trees, and the light breeze,
And the melody it sings;
And the night-birds in the white trees,
And the moonlight on their wings !
And the hoof-thuds on the brown loam
As the merry drovers go
To the fireside of the town home,
To the cheery tavern glow.
And the shearers they are singing
At the station down the lane ;
I can hear the voices ringing
To some cheery old refrain.
Oh ! the glad songs and the s&d songs,
And the night songs and the aay ;
And the dead songs and the wed song 3,
And the grave songs and the gay !
Ah ! they sing no more together
In those sullen days of June,
And the bitter wintry weather
Sweeps the road to Denistoun.
And the wattle-birds are calling
Where the sporting spoilers stalk ;
And the snowy shrouds are falling
O’er the paths we used to walk.
Ay ! the snow is on the roadways,
And the ice is on the streams,
And ’tis spell time from the load-days
For the stolid bullock teams.
And the boys are trapping rabbits,
Or, away in Hobart Town,
Are acquiring lazy habits
In the parlor of the “ Crown.”
But I’ll meet you in the dew-days
When the sunlight drinks the snow;
I will kiss you in the new days
As I kissed you long ago ;
I will see you in the bright nights
With the glory of your face,
I will meet you through the white nights
At the old-time trysting place !
When the way is white with clover,
And the briar-blooms shining over,
And the weeping willows listen to the happy river
tune;
When the charlock weed is yellow
And the moon is bright and mellow
I will meet you in November on the road t®
Denistoun.

Seafarers.
THEY shanghaied us in Frisco,
And we fetched up in Bombay.
They set us afloat, on an old Leith boat,
That steered like a stack o’ hay.
We panted in the tropics,
When the pitch boiled up on deck.
We have saved our hides, and little besides,
From an ice-cold North Sea wreck.
We have drunk our rum in Portland.
We have threshed up Behring Strait.
We have toed the mark, on a Yankee barque,
With a hard-case Down-East mate.
We know the streets of Santos,
The loom of the lone Azores.
And we found our grub, in a salt horse tub,
Condemned from the Navy stores.
We know the track to Auckland,
And the light on Sydney Head.
We have crept close-hauled, while the leads-
man called,
The depth of the Channel’s bed.
We know the quays of Glasgow,
And the river at Saigon,
And have drunk our glass, with a Chinese lass.
In a house-boat at Canton.
They pay us off in London
(It’s oh, for a spell ashore),
And again we ship, for the Southern trip,
In a week or hardly more.
It’s “good-bye Sally and Sue,”
For it’s time to get afloat,
With an aching head, and a straw-stuffed bed,
A knife, and an oilskin coat.
Sing “ Time to leave her, Johnnie,”
Sing “ Bound for the Rio Grande. ’
When the tug turns back, we follow her track.
For a long last look at land.
Then the purple disappears.
And only the blue is seen,
That will send our bones down to Davy Jones,
And our souls to Fiddlers’ Green.

“ Billy the Nutt ” : “ Yes ; that Bulletin
yarn, t’other day, about er barber bloke getten’
even on a funny man reads orlight, but up on the
Towers in ’94 I knowed a funny hair-shifter that
fell in bad. He had as many tricks as a monkey,
an’ on Sat’day, when he’d have one or two in,and
some blokes waitin’ a turn, he was sure to pull
somebody’s leg, and, as he wuz credited with a
dirty left, the bloke what was ’ad useter dicken
he liked it. Once I saw Billy, when ’e wuz
shavin’ a cove, nip the bloke’s ear wiff his nail an’
say, ‘O, ’ell! I beg yer pardin.’ The man in
ther chair jumped up an’ grabbed at his listener,
an’ w’en ’e found nothin’ wrong, the crowd laughed
an’ Bill winked at ’em, an’ kidded ’e’d made a
bloomer. But one day a bloke came in from the
Black Jack ter get trimmed up, an’ w’en Bill got
’im inter ther chair he dipped ’is razor inter ther
hot water —bilin’, mind yer ! —and drawd the back
uv it acrost the bloke’s throat. ’Struth, he did
jump, and Bill he couldn’t help a bit of a grin ; but
w’en the bloke saw it was a take-down, he got on
to Bill quick an’ lively, and they scrapped orl
over the shop and right inter ther winder; an’
combs an’ brushes an’ blud an ’air an’ shavin’-
pots was flyin’ all over the place. Then Bill’s
wife, ’earin’ the row, rushed in, grabbed ther can
of hot water, and tried to whack it onter ther
stranger, but landed ther water fair on Bill’s head
an’ scalded half ther hair off. He was in bed for
a week, an’ he’s gone clean out of the funny biz-
ness now. Says it’s too expensive.”
“ Edyson ” : You still meet quaint and
primitive folk in the wilds of Bungaree, despite
the penetrating railway and compulsory educa-
tion. Tim MTvor was a sample of the earlier
days. Born in the great Victorian spud centre,
Tim surprised his widespread neighbors by break-
ing from home, building a hut, and settling down
with the dairymaid, kitchen wench, and biddy of
all work off the parental estate. By-aud-bye,
there were curious inquiries—people wanted to
know if Tim and Kitty were married. Tim
answered insinuations with a grin and a knowing
wink ; but the scandal spread till it came to the
ears of Father Quinlan himself. He called on
Tim, and put it to him straight. “Are you
married to the poor gyrl, MTvor?” “I am,”
said Tim. “ ’N’ when did it happen, ’n’ where ?”
asked the priest, suspiciously. “It happened on the
shly, ’n’ ye married usyerself, sorr.” “ I married
ye? Ut’s a lie!” cried the indignant pastor. “But
ye did, though,” persisted Tim, “’n’on the shly,
’n’ unbeknowns t’ ye, ut was.” “How could that
be, Tim Mclvor ? ” “ Aisy enough if a man have
the cunnin’. Shure, I hadn’t the money t’ be
wastin’ on a weddin all t’ meself, V so ye mind
the marrin’ if Slathery ’n’ the widdy Hogan ?
Well, meself ’n’ Kate stud outside the church
under the windy, ’n’ we heard every wor-rd ye
said, ’n’ we answered ‘yis’ ’n’ ‘no,’ ’n’ I put the
ring on her. Ye married us yerself ’n’ ye can’t go
past ut though ’twas done on the shly.” It took
a power of argument to convince Tim he was not
legally married, and he would only consent to go
through the ceremony again on the understanding
that no bill would be sent in.

“ Hamer ” : One recent night I took some
salad, and I never read of anything in the “Abo-
riginalities ” like the animal that chased me. I
had my back to it; but it seemed a cross between
a bunyip and a sea-serpent, and it had a breath of
mixed drinks, and that snake whose length can
never be decided was sticking out of its ear. As
it gained on me, I took refuge on the tender of
C. A. »1 effries’ engine, driven by Jones. It raced
like mad, and swayed, and rattled over embank-
ments and bridges constructed by the S.M.
Herald’s incompetent Socialist. We escaped
miraculously ; the bridges and embankments fell
directly we passed. Then the train was attacked
by spiders, and I threw myself over the bridge
and ran for my life, pursued by the Tantanoola
tiger, and followed with difficulty the flight of a
bee with thistledown glued to its tummy. As I
passed various grog shanties, I blewed thousand-
pound cheques and drank quarts of methylated
spirits and turpentine. The alligator who kept
the last pub joined the chase, and if he hadn’t
stumbled over a meat-eating rabbit and fallen up
a tree and been drowned, I can’t imagine what
might not have happened to me.

“The Prooshan ” tells how Harvey
descended an old shaft: —
“ I was pokin’ along the old Fletcher line er reef,
thuther day,” said Harvey. “ I was wantin’ to try a
3haft Yaller Jimmy ’n’ me put down 17 year ago. The
leader pinched on us at 20 foot, and we slung it. Then
Butcher Bill ’n’ Beardy Jim put it down another 20 foot,
’n’ left it. I alius had a sort er ’ankerin’ after it though,
so I thinks I’d go down last Sunday and scratch round a
bit. I takes a few tools ’n’ a rope, and when I gets there
I drops the tools down, and fastens the rope to a dry
stump, and slings the rest below, and starts climbin’
down. Presently I feels the rope give, and down I goes
splash into three foot er water, but falls on me feet. An’
when I looks up I see the stump cornin’ like a bag er
spuds, and bringing showers er mud off the sides and
rubbidge. Well, I crouches down in the corner and
jerks out, ‘ Gord save me,’ and down flops that
stump right aside me, and sends the water all over me.
I had a narrer scrape. Then I sees two little stars in the
bit er blue sky above me. I makes fer them stars,
settin’ me back agin the wall, and jist able to reach the
opsit wall, ’ere and there, but I has to do a fair corkscrew
to find the shortest dyameter. When I gets four foot
from the top I feels me legs tinglin’ under the knees.
Cramps cornin’, thinks I, but they kept orf. I spirals a
bit more, diggin’ me elbows into the walls till they was
raw. Presently an old billy-goat looks down at me, an’
with one snort he bolts fer ’is nacheral. Well, I clumbed
within a foot er the top, and there I stuck. There warn’t
nuthin’ to grab a ’olt of, and the shaft was wider there.
I couldn’t reach acrost, ’n’ if I loses me parerlel, down I
goes. I yelled for ’elp, but no answer, ’n’ the wind was
blowin’ orful. Louder ’n’ louder it comes, and at last —
swish, bang—and down comes a gum saplin’ fair acrost
the shaft, and I grabs it and pulls meself out. I don’t
try any more deserted shafts now. I reckon it’s mar-
vulous how that saplin’ came down in the very nick er
time.”
RELIGION VERSUS NERVE.
SOUL VARNISHER : “ How is it that youd on’t
attend now?"
VICTIM: “ Too much 'ligion no good; make it frighten; can't ridem horse."
‘ ‘ Kodak ” : In
’94, one of a Kal-
goorlie prospecting
party (call him Clar-
ence Adolphus) got
lost, and the rest of
the crowd went out
in search, and wan-
dered about, cursing,
for a day and a
night. Then they
came back to camp
for a supply of water
with which to re-
sume the search, and
Bloggs, the treasurer
of the party—the
only bushman of the
lot—volunteered to
go out and do some
further searching by
himself. He went,
and before he had
been gone eight
hours, the original
lost man turned up
unassisted, where-
upon the camp re-
joiced, and sat down
to welcome Bloggs,
the searcher, when
he should turn up.
After two days’ wait-
ing, the party arose,
lamenting forcibly,
and went out into
the wilderness once
more—this time to
look for Bloggs. A
few days wandering
revealed no traces of
the missing man, and
at last, in despera-
tion, the freshest of
the dog-weary band
walked 20 miles to
the nearest police
camp, and borrowed
a black tracker.
Then the two hurried
back to camp, and a
sorrowful expedition
set out in search
of the treasurer's
corpse. They tracked
him —5O scorching
miles —to a lonely
sly-grog shanty,
where they found
him, sleeping the
sleep of the utterly
drunk. He had been
on a jamboree for
two days. He ac-
cepted the hysterical
challenge of the
gang’s fighter, and
in five sledge-ham-
mer hits disabled
that person most
effectually. Then he
made a speech to
the effect that he
had never been lost
in his life, and it
was just like their
condemned cheek to
think that he had
begun to be a fool in
his old age. He had
merely desired to
have a few drinks,
and he had pro-
ceeded to get them.
Finally, he said he
wouldn’t belong to
such a gang of in-
capables any longer, and the best thing they could
do would be to hire the tracker to take them
back again to their condemned orphan-asylum
of a camp, or they’d all get lost on the way. And,
as their astounding experiences had severely
shaken their confidence, they took his advice.

“ Trufchibus ” about an animal :
All this talk in the paper about the “ burglary boom ”
reminds me of the time we were burgled in the bush. I
was staying on a farm, at Tynong, (Gippsland), with the
son of the owner, and we were both about fourteen. A
few nights before our arrival, the hands, consisting of
four men, were playing euchre. One of them happened
to look up at the window, and immediately a head, with a
broken nose attached to it, bobbed out of sight. It may
have been only a harmless swaggie, anyway they
chivvied him across country for about three miles. Then
they grew tired and came home.
That started it. They were still having that burglar
for breakfast, dinner, and tea, when we arrived. In fact
the cook was the only unbeliever in the house. A week
after our arrival, we were awakened about one o’clock in
the morning, by the sound of footsteps on the front
verandah. Our hair rose. We rose. We roused the
others and held a consultation. Samuel had gone
to bed nicely stocked with whisky. He promptly
seized a piece of firewood and sallied out to investi-
gate. The cook, a nice old girl of about 50, was the
last on the scene. She scouted the idea of burglars ;
also she knew nothing about Samuel, who had gone to
do or die with the firewood in his hand, and we forgot to
mention him. Taking the candle she boldly opened the
front door. Immediately there was a shriek. The cook
threw up her arms, and the candle flew backwards
through the air, and struck the foremost of our party on
the nose. We fled, leaving the cook,'the burglar, and the
devil to fight it out.
When we returned at last, Samuel was just coming-out
of hysterics, and the cook was sitting on the floor with a
face like a nightmare. As she had opened the door,
Samuel (finding it cold in his white nightshirt) had walked
in, hence the terror. Just then we found the burglar.
It put in its head and said “ moo,” and then knocked the
undressed Samuel over the cook. She threw him off as
if he were accursed, and from her position on the floor
resigned her job. She said she wouldn’t stay in a house
where half-dressed Samuels fell on her in the middle of
the night. We didn’t have a decent meal for two days
till she relented.

“S.S.” : My Gippslander tells of an in-
stance of the subjugation of man in the wilder-
ness. , He was staying at a drear little bridge pub.
(there’s a pub. at every river bridge in Gippsland),
and noticed a sort of rouseabout as being the most
woebegone human he had ever set eyes on. The
man was about 30, slip-shod, long-haired, un-
shaven, and so much hustled that he always
seemed at the point of rushing out of his clothes.
His chief hustler was the kitchen biddy, “Soo-
zann.’ “Soozann” was a large, brown savage of
a girl, with an arm like a back-log, and a fist like
a red-gum stump. She gave the poor handy man
Gehenna and sundries about 20 times a day.
When he didn’t do things with sufficient sudden-
ness to please her—and she was a swift girl, who
demanded a great deal of suddenness—she ran
after him with a pot-stick ; if lie dared to try to
be comfortable in the kitchen she ran him out;
and for 16 hours a day her tongue was clattering
at him like tm pails raining on-a pavement. The
buppslander felt tired, and told “ Soozann ” that
she had no right to harry the poor wreck in that
fashion. No right ?” cried Soozann ; “no right ?
My eyes, I like that! Ain’t I engaged to him ?”
Said “ Coolibah Charlie”: “One after-
noon, near Lambin’ Camp, I spotted a ‘swaggie,’
as you call ’em—‘ traveller,’as us westerners call
’em. He was sittin’ down on Matilda, lookin’ fair
done in, reg’ler dead beat. I drew over t’ ’im t’
give th’ poor beggar a lift. ‘Good day, matey,’
sez I. ‘Good day,’ sez he. ‘Where are yer
makin’ for? If it’s on my track, I’ll- give you an’
Tilly a lift, ’ sez I. ‘Blowed if I know,’ sez he;
‘ I’m just considerin’ whether I’ll skip th’ bloomin’
gutter or merely crawl under th’ wire fence. Can
you wait ten minutes till I come to a decision ? ’
‘ Yers, if y’ ain’t too lorng,’ sez I. F’r a lark I
waits a good ten minutes, while he and himself
argied the trouble out. Suddenly he jumps up,
his eyes bulgin’. ‘ I’ve decided to go below.
You’ll find me hangin’ on that leopard tree when
yer cornin’ back,’ he sez. I jollied ’im ; offered t’
fight ’im, just to shake th’ nonsense out ov ’im ;
threatened ter git off th’ coach an’ throw ’im inter
th’ boot. No use. He wouldn’t budge. I told
th’ p’lice when I got ter Wentworth. They just
larfed at me f’r a fool wot got his leg pulled with-
out knowin’ it. But I knowed better. On th’ re-
turn trip I found ’im ’angin’ from the lowest limb
o’ th’ leopard-wood, jus’ as I expected.”

“ The Mussel ” : Everybody must have
heard something of the song, “Jack Dowling, the
Wild Colonial Boy.” Did anybody ever hear all
of it ? There are several million verses. The first
time I came across it was in 1876, when sitting on
the_ box-seat with the coachman on Cobb and
Co.’s, from Scarsdale to Ballarat—ls miles. He
(the coachman) sang the dreadful production the
whole of the trip, and when we arrived at Ballarat
he seemed to be just getting into form. From the
evidence given in this melancholy dirge, it would
appear that the “ Wild Colonial Boy ” was a bush-
ranger with a ridiculous number of superfluous
halos. A Chinese opera (where the hero is born on
the stage, and the performers get exhausted after
following his career for eight or ten days) is a fool
compared to him. Again I heard part of the song
recently in a suburban hotel, but after the 173rd
verse, it was close-up time, and the “Boy” had
j ust got out of long clothes. Anyway, who was the
“Wild Colonial Boy, ” and what was he wild about ?

“ R.R.R.” : A Rangatira Maori, the other
day, bought a small two-horse-power engine, and
being a bit of an engineer, rigged it on his chaff-
cutter. When the chaff-cutter was full the power
was not quite sufficient, and the thing jibbed. So
the Maori put the handles on and personally
assisted the engine. This acted well. One day
Mr. Maori and Miss Maori were at the handles,
and Mrs. Maori was feeding the chaffer, also the
picaninnv was helping. Mrs. Brown Woman
allowed the hay-box to run empty. Then came
the engine’s turn. It took charge of Mr. Maori,
also his assistant, Miss Maori, and there was a
circus. They held on to the handle grimly, and
were whirled round and round. Mr. Maori was
a good deal injured, and his female assistant, Miss
Brown Girl, had her modesty hurt, also she
acquired many bruises. Mrs. Maori’s certificate
was suspended as soon as her husband got away
from the handle; also a piece of rope fell on her
many times.
A WAYBACK CATASTROPHE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Full sixteen men
Were in the bar
When Thirsty Joe,
All yolk and tar,
Said : “ Coves, I have
A word to say,
Which has occurred
To me to-day.
“ Don’t talk to me
Of parsons good.
I would not like
Them, if I could,
For, once, way back
On Pinkenbar,
I had a taste
Of what they are.
“ A drought was on,
And all the land
Was wrapped in heat,
And bones and sand.
All waterholes
Were cracked and dry
And we just gasped
And pra\’ed to die.
“ The only thing
That held me up
Was rum—of which
I’d just a sup.
All day and night
I guarded it.
’Twas valued as
Ice in The Pit.
“ One day he came,
This parson bloke,
All sweat and dust.
His aged moke
Was white with foam,
And clearly blown.
(I did fall in,
I fairly own.)
“‘A snake ! a snake !
Has chewed my leg.
Oh, help me, praj%
Some rum I beg,
Or whisky e’en,
Or anything,
To save my life,
And numb the sting.’
“ Away I went
And got my rum,
To save this cove
From Kingdom Come.
He seized the flask
With eager hand,
Then drank the lot,
And gurgled ‘ Grand ! ’
“ ’Twas then we thought
To ask him where
The snake hite was—•
He pulled his hair,
And wiped his lips,
And said ‘ Oh dear,
’Twas not a snake
At all, I fear.
“ ‘ I fancy that
Some bull-dog ants
Had somehow got
Inside my pants.
I’m sorry such
A fuss to make,
But thought at first
It was a snake.’
“ My awful loss
Had made me dumb ;
My senses seemed
To go and come.
With dizzy brain
I watched him there,
I was too dazed
To even swear.
“ My rum teas gone,
And left me dry.
That parson told
A cruel lie.
'Twas hard to be
So basely robbed ;
I sat down in
The dust—and sobbed.
“ And that is why
My faith is broke
In each white-faced,
White-collared bloke.
He stole my rum !
Left me a thirst!!!
I feared for weeks
My heart had burst."

npHE trooper was taking statistics,
* And the cocky, with open look,
Gave him a list of the stock he had —

My Metempsychoses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SIGNS OF FRAY.
“ Of course, Major, you have smelt powder?”
“Smelt it, madam! Why, I've often wakened up of a morning and found the
breast of my coat perfectly white with it!"
I ’YE had a many bodies—l have lived a many
lives —
I started when the Universe was young ;
I’ve been wrecked on reefs now miles below —I’ve
married many wives,
And my treble piped ere Orpheus’ song was sung.
And, coming to more modern times, I mind me
how I fought
In the front of pirate fights upon the Main ;
And that memory is the father and mother of the
thought
To go west away and buccaneer again.
But this century has iron laws—there’s but the
vaguest glimpse
Of romantic schemes of robbery—poetic ways to
steal;
Long dead the times of rape and raid within the
dusk and dimpse,
The piracies on Cuban coasts—the smuggling out
of Deal.
Spoiling in the castle's sack ,
Spoiling to the Horn and hack,
Where the sea is iceberg-white , and where the
pallid squalls are stored;
Spoiling all on land and sea,
Fleming, Spaniard, Portugee —
For masthead grog and silver bars, and all the
girls aboard.
I was king of all the cave-men, and I filled them
all with fear,
On the bones thrown o’er my shoulder they were
fed ;
I was the only living man who knew to barb a
spear —
(They thought better to be humble than be dead)
I was the only man on earth who had a fletchered
spear,
And I kept' its secret as a precious hoard ;
The tribesmen gladly ate the bones—l kept them
all in fear,
And they sold me all their girls to pay their board.
For I had the only spear,
And I kept them steeped in fear,
Tho' revenge against me in their hearts they stored;
I took Agonda’s head,
As a pillow to my bed, —
Ate all the meat and took their girls by board.
I was the fierce-beaked Norseman when they went
to look for rows ;
We were never coystrels—never niddering ;
We fought ’em, drunk or sober, in the hold or on
the bows,
And aloft their red blood-eagles we did fling !
When our king grew fey, and died, and left his
warriors vacant posts,
The claimants to the throne just formed a ring,
And there before the people and our winged-
helmeted hosts
They made their stern brown swords select a king !
There was never any ballot-box and little Parlia-
ment,
The king by being kingly held his throne,
Till a newer, fairer liar, or a harder fighter went
To the lists to win the kingship on his own.
When he 'd won it he embezzled all the best and
kindest land;
He left the mass to join the new'er leaven;
Till the finest, fiercest fighter in all our fine, fierce
band
Showed that second kingly soul the way to
Heaven !
Oh ! Odd-a-Tongue loved Swanhild, but I put
him to the rout;
I stopped his amorous heigh ho ! with my sword
(For it’s ill to fight for plackets when your cun-
ning is in doubt);
And I cut my way through Swanhild’s kin aboard.
Spoiling all by moss and fell;
Spoiling all and raising hell.
On the grim Norwegian scarp, and by the calm
fiord ;
Oh, the skalds hare sweetly sung
How I blinded Odd-a-Tongue —
Spoiled his mead, and seed, and feed, and took his
troth by board.
I was first with the moss-troopers, and I forced a-
many keeps,
I have made the blazing castles pale the stars ;
And now, while Lady Ffolliot at my lime-tanned
thigh-boot weeps,
I drink red wine ’tween my brazen helmet bars ;
Oh ! it’s death to him who’s vanquished, and it’s
joy to him who wins,
And it’s cattle—no one questions “Why?” or
“ How ? ”
And the wages are the greater for the greater pile
of sins,
And Queen Ffolliot’s captive at my saddle-bow !
Her husband dared to follow us, and threatened
loud and high,
And spake unto my Lordship bitter things ;
So I brake his kneepans twain, and I left him
there to die,
And reflect on the uncertainties of kings.
For he that won the fight
Was always in the right,
And that stolen queen on victor's couch shall lie ;
Through the helmet bars the wine,
And the ride through woodland pine,
While the vanquished pray to us for leave to die.
Next I sailed to far Barbadoes from the little port
of Hull,
Where my creditors were pestilent and vile;
But all scriveners are blooded thin, and, saints be
praised, are dull;
And with pier-head jumps I paid them by the
mile.
At sea we sat in judgment, each upon the other
man,
And cleansed our shipping list of any. stain ;
With the finest lot of blackguards from Beersheba
to Dan,
We sailed due west for Indies and the Main.
Looking for a Spanish ship,
On a silver-laden trip,
With our lingers itching for the Spanish hoard —
For the grog to masthead height,
For the doubloons water-white,
And the pick of all the pretty girls aboard.
I was dressed in silks and satins—l had bullion on
my coat—
And I strutted with a straight sword at my thigh;
The price of many an empress clasped the lace
about my throat,
And I wore a look at once both fierce and high.
We were dandy bandbox pirates—we’d a fine
display of hose—
We were cut-throats of most murderous etiquette;
We politely made the vanquished, as the tropic
sun arose,
Walk the plank (and also when the sun had set).
Oh ! the joy of pirate living—the under-swell
a-going down,
And the calm a-calling prizes up from underneath
the world
Reeking gold, and blest with donnas—Oh ! the
black eyes and the brown !
Oh ! the fear our sable banner made whenever it
unfurled,
The Milky Way, Magellan, and the Serpent and
, Orion,
The sun and moon, aye steered us to the joy of
girls to hold;
When we lost the Pole Star we would lift the
Southern Cross ! the Lion !
The Dutchman’s Hope ! The Virgin’s Brooch!
Oh ! all stars lead to gold !
We beached the ship at Cocos Isles, where the
nutmegs burst ripe brown,
And the girls are mellifluent, like the flowers ;
Those maturescent loves were kind altho’ their
chiefs did frown,
And their wealth and warmth of love was all their
dowers.
And then—away to sea again, to chase the sky-line
haze,
Till a treasure-balaced carrack or a galleon from
Spain
Came up—the Spaniards’ faces pale as moons on
sunny days,
For we took the bars and burned their ships and
put them out of pain.
Taking of a Spanish ship,
On a silver-laden trip
For the sake of true religion, and the glory of our
Lord;
The specie figures high,
The Spaniard he must die !
And there’s grog and swift allotment of the Spianisk
girls aboard.
But our band soon came to grief, for my captain
and the master
Were hunted by Armadas through the world and
all its seas;
We had killed Yves Ramiro, who had courted his
disaster,
By hiding all his gold ; and even blacker crimes
than these.
So we tied him to the capstan, and we were drunken
on Canary,
And we pelted him with bottles though he uttered
not a cry ;
But he prayed to Pig Antonio and unto “ Madre
Mary,”
Till a bottle-heel laid bare his brain and he was
fain to die.
We were chased by an Armada from the Behring
to the Horn,
And the seas were hot to hold us and the simmer-
ing calm came down ;
And their boats attacked at midnight ! By the
day-dawn we were borne,
To the galleon, and the racks of Inquisition and
of Crown.
But the winds came up like footless ghosts, their
shrouds in other stars
(Oh ! the moving circle when she runs !)
And the combers’ iron-heels did twist the laying-
pins and bars
(Oh ! the sea-gleam on the dripping decks and
guns !)
As she steadied to her beam like the tight-rope of
a dancer,
The fanning maintopsail blew skyward free !
In the gale we filed our fetters while the thunder
gave us answer,
And the winners lost ! We won again the sea !
Of the tortures they had promised us we paid
them full acoompt
And they walked the plank as we shared out
their hoard ;
The debit side was altered but the settlement was
prompt,
And the dead men’s donnas stayed with us aboard !
And that silver ship we sailed
To isles where no voices hailed,
A ncl altho' the Spanish ladies wept and fleeched us
sore I Good Lord !
We kept them—for their eyes,
Were but portion of the prize,
Of masthead grog, and specie, and the pack of girls
aboard !
Next, as slaver, I was squall-blown from the
mouth of Bonny River,
And we puckalowed the Africans from off the
Benin Bight;
And our cargo died of land-damp and of mangrove
stink and shiver ;
So we stole another slaver’s human cargo in the
night.
A politeful Portugee was he—his hold was fillel
with Kroomen,
And he wore eye-turned moustacliios —his words
were kind and low ;
But he cursed in Kroo and Portugee when we
kidnapped all his women,
And puckalowed his niggers at the isle For
nando Po.
We’d a big, loose, double-jointed Yankee ruffian
for a skipper ;
Man-eater every tooth of him, and twice as sly as
slush •,
Getting every inch of speed from out the fine run
of our clipper —
She’d a record in her forefoot, and at her prow a
rush !
All oaken planks, and not a peg of teak in her,
Slipping on a sleepy swell, and climbing up a sea,
Moved like a fish, and not a blessed creak in her,
And she helped us on to loot him—that politeful
Portugee.
On the Bonny, in the Bight,
Duffing niggers by the night,
Thieving by strategic schemes, and stealing with the
sword ;
Dealing out the laws of sea
To the vanquished Portugee,
Stealing all his grog, and milreas, and his pick of
girls aboard.
I know how a tornado’s born —his midwife is the
blink, ,
The land-loom blink that calls for leagues of room;
I’ve seen it catch the slaver ship before a rat could
think, ,
Tearing shroud and splintering mast and stu nsai
boom. .. V 1
And after it a brazen calm —our heavy sails, Jme
lead,
Hung silvered in the over-flowering moon ;
Below a white man couldn’t breathe, and many
slaves were dead,
And the ’roaches ate the others in their swoon.
The ocean steamed the livelong day, the sla\es
died day and night,
The sharks lay by our stern at night and noon
For the freeing of the shackle ; then—a belly-tlasii
of white
As they ate the cargo of the barracoon.
But we got another cargo, and we branded tnem
by night, . , ~
On fifty thousand dollars’ worth we barred tiie
hatches down ; , ,
And our crew grew merry all at the crowaea-
’tween-decks sight, „ ,
Sing “Mynheer on the Spanker Boom an<
“ Blanky Mr. Brown.”
By the creeks of Cameroon,
In the sweating barracoon, ..
It was stinking work and low, I knowl Good Bor .
It was making small traverses,
But the slaves, their babes and nurses.
Represented grog, and gold, and girls to board.
And next I was a ranger in the wild Australian
bush, ,
Where the ways of losing life were rare and new.
Oh ! the joy of duffing cattle, and the thunder,
and the rush, . ,
Of the hoofbeats and the sprinkling of the dew.
Oh! the sympathetic stallion, and the musk
enscented track,
With never God nor man to thwart your will;
When the horse has all the pleasure of the rider
on his back, , „
And a journey never ends without ‘ a kill-
We bailed up all the stations, and we lifted all the
flocks, . . TT , .
And we made the ladies dance —like Robin 1 Lood .
And we looted all the gold escorts at old Eugowra
Rocks,
And never had a fear dilute our blood.
Lifting stud and herd by force,
And then “ To horse I To horse I”
Scorning jail , and law , and dll their Wdtch dnd
ward ;
Doing in these modern ways,
All my deeds of wilder days,
And still getting grog , and gold, and girls to
board.
The times are changed from all those times—the
pirate and the slave
Are with us still, but under other names.
We no longer are the scourges of the wood and of
the wave,
But there’s modern ways of playing ancient
games.
So I’ve tried, well —mine-promoting ; on the
’Change I buccaneer
(Now the pirate wears a glossy Paris hat).
Shoddy titles in my future, though a shady past
a-rear,
For I’ll float the Shyster Reef at Goosegreen Flat.
I’m armed with lying telegrams ; my gun s a
false report;
My boarders are a board of guinea-pigs.
I no longer swear by halidoms, nor wildly fight
d mort,
For both are low —I’m working market rigs.
No more my brazen armorings I wear in cuirass-
wise—
I’ve a watch-chained fancy vesture in its place.
My hose has changed to trousers, and my sword is
forged of lies,
And I wear my brazen armor on my face.
No more a bold moss-trooper I—no more a slaver
swart,
No pirate fierce, no outlaw in the range.
But there’s gold in greater plenty to be had, and
greater sport
When you buccaneer upon the Stock Exchange.
My galleon is a bank,
And the stoup that erst I drank,
Now is Heidsieck—at a bijou villa stored,
Paid for by a shyster mine,
Which has yielded gold arid wine,
Grog, and gold, and all the pretty girls aboard.

The Candle,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SERVED HIM RIGHT.
LAL : “ Why did you return his poem?” SAL : “Because he called it ‘LINES on my face.’ ”
QUITE suddenly he drifted in,
Like this le-down before the breeze.
He had a bag, he wore a grin,
His pants were baggy at the knees.
As pale as tallow was his face.
He bowed to me with courtly grace.
Upon his crown one lock of hair
Stood up, just like a candle wick.
As he politely waited there,
I thought, “ How like a candlestick
He is—and that old hat of fur
That is his big extinguisher.”
He bowed again, but spake no word
(I doubt not that he’d come to sell
Some ware both useless and absurd),
Yet neath the strange mesmeric spell
Of his deep eyes and grim, I sat,
And stared at him and his old hat.
Likewise at his one raven lock,
So stiff and still, I wondered long.
Till, with a sharp and sudden shock,
I heard myself remark, “’Tis wrong
So long to stare, and think, and sit,
This candle’s waiting to be pit !”
As in a dream, I rose and struck
A match upon the office wall.
(Alas ! ’twas my accursed luck,
Why did not someone shout or call ?)
I held the flame against his hair—
A fizz—a smell—a horrid swear !
A vacant spot where was a man
A moment since. Upon the stair
Something affrighted downward ran,
Rending the close and silent air
With frantic curse and frenzied shout.
And so—that candle quaint went out.

KOKAK.
His Honeymoon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE tropic night was warm and breath-
less. The coolest place was to be found
on the stone terrace facing the river,
where Mrs. Robin Bell and her friend were lying
back in comfortable lounge chairs. For an hour and
a half young Fred Gordon had been talking, his
subject being the charms of another woman, and
the details pertaining to his courtship of her. In
his eyes there had never been such another gifted
creature in the world, nor such an exceptionally
interesting love story. As a matter of fact, the
young woman concerned was a very ordinary per-
son, and the courtship had been peculiarly tame,
and quite unopposed. Therefore, the murmured
dissent of the two listeners was not very em-
phatic, when the youth suggested that he had
bored them long enough, and each gave a sigh of
relief as his full form disappeared into the library,
where Robin Bell was reading the paper.
However, Robin did listen —perhaps there was
something in the look of the lad’s honest blue
eyes, softened and love-lit, which compelled him
to. He laid down his paper and took up his pipe,
and Fred talked. Every word could be distinctly
heard by the women through the open French
window, but they were saved the trouble of
answering now. It seemed that Fred wanted to
consult Robin about the honeymoon (for the
wonderful courtship was soon to culminate in a
wedding). “ You married chaps understand
these things,” he said. “Nella leaves the choice
to me. Thought of the mountains, but they are
too cold in April—ours is to be an April wedding,
you know.”
Robin knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and
gazed meditatively into the dark of the open
window.
“April,” he said, “and a honeymoon! Yes,
I can tell you—the Hawkesbury. Somewhere
into the quiet reaches by Kuringai Chase. You
could get a houseboat easily in April when all
your friends are merry-making at the Easter
festivities in the city. All the wattle will be out
then—the hills yellow with it. There will be a
tang of winter in the air just cold enough to make
a big white shawl necessary—one of those fleecy
things to wrap round her when you are sitting on
the deck at night. Remember there will only be
you two, because the man who is caretaker and
cook and arbiter of all the material things of life,
will row over to the mainland at sundown. So
there will just be you two alone in the moonlight.
l)o you know how the moonlight looks on those
waters in April ? A great silver pathway into the
unknown. Every now and then the boat’s prow
swings into it with the pull of the tide. You can’t
see the big, rocky capes wooded to the very edge
of the water, but you know they are there, lost in
a silver mist.
“And this same moonlight makes you think all
sorts of odd thoughts—of love, stronger than
passion, greater than time, lasting into eternity ;
of wonder and longing satisfied at last. Even then,
with the girl so close to you that you can hear her
heart beating against your own and feel her eye-
lashes fluttering against your cheek, you realise
how strong the intangible barrier is that divides
one individuality from the other. Both of you
will be dreaming of the mystery of love —of
“other worlds than ours” whe-e, perhaps, the
mystery will be solved and the longing satisfied.
“ Well, there is something about that first even-
in'; alone in the moonlight while the boat anchors
over deep waters, that neither of you will ever
forget. But that doesn’t last. We are all
materialists, and happier as such. You have only
been married a day, remember, and the isolation
and the novelty of it all is its charm. Besides, it
is never good to look too long at souls.
“ Within there is the lamplight and the cosy
cabin, with the red curtains drawn to shut out the
moonlight. The lamp has a red shade, too, and
when the girl nestles down into the big chair
beside it her fleecy shawl falls back, and it and
her pretty white neck are all rosy in its glow. She
doesn’t look so ethereal now.; she is just a woman
—the one woman in the world for you ; and the
shyness and the trust in her brown eyes, and the
color that suddenly flames into her pale cheeks
and burns there is for you.
“ If you wake in the night there will be nothing
to disturb you, except, perhaps, the leap of a fish
in the moonlight, or the plash of the wind-ruffled
water against the sides of the house-boat.
“ It is different in the daytime, of course ; there
is the sunshine. God, what sunshine ! with the
scent of the wattle everywhere, and the blue of
thesky and the reflections inthewater—everything
floats double in those still, green reaches ! You
take a boat then, and row away up one of the
inlets, where there is no life at all except the rock
wallaby and the birds on shore. Close to it are
shallows, where you can fish, and rocks covered
with oysters- the material side of things again.
Over the rock io the w.tu r’s edge hang trails of
white travellers’ joy and purple creepers—and she
will want you to pull great armfuls for her until
the boat looks like a. gondola in the bat tie of
flowers. She dot s not look a hi' like the moon
light girl now—or the lamplight one either. She
is the sunshine one,; the wind blows the dmi,
curls about her forehead, and the sun makes her
wrinkle up the corners of her eyes; they look like
bits of black onyx between the ion,; lashes, :
the noonday heat brings the soft color a 0 bn into
the pale olive of her cheek.
“ You land at the head of the inlet, where the
rocks slope down to a miniature beach, and you
light the fire and put the billy on to boil, while
she flits about and spreads the lunch on a flat
rock, and then you can lie still and smoke,
and day-dream of the old days, when you
did not know her, and there were only fancy faces
in the smoke rings floating round you—you
might spend a week amongst the inlets, counting
every day begrudgingly that fled by leaving you
nearer to the city and further from the wilderness.
A week. Ah ! it is all too short. Only seven
days of sunshine and rippling water and wattle-
scented air, only seven nights of moonlight and
the mystery of first love —of the red, lamp-lit cabin
and the splash of the water to lull you to sleep ”
“ By Jove ! ” said Fred Gordon admiringly (and
Robin paused suddenly at the interruption, and
started as a man does who is suddenly awakened
from a dream). “By Jove, old man, you talk
like a book, and it does sound rippin’—what a time
you must have had to remember it like that !
Shall tell Nella what you say—she is a most
remarkable girl; in all my experience of women,
Robin, I don’t think I’ve ever come across such a
high-minded”—— and so on and so on. Fred Gor-
don had the floor now, and was off at full speed,
while Robin Bell relapsed into his usual taci-
turnity.
Mrs. Bell shrugged her plump white shoulders
and settled herself more comfortably in the chair,
but the friend sat up suddenly and eyed her
curiously.
“How odd !” she said. “ I should never have
imagined you two honeymooning so romantically.
You must have changed your temperament with
the color of your hair—Robin mentioned dark ha'r
if I’m not mistaken.”
Mrs. Bell laughed good-naturedly.
TESTING HER EYESIGHT.
OCULIST : "Now, ma’am, tell me which of them lines you can read the plainest ?”
“Robin was painting an ideal honeymoon, of
course,” she said, “and my hair was always fair,
I am afraid Robin was making fun of that poor
young man. Fancy Nella Jones with her scarlet
locks being recommended to a back-ground
upholstered in red?” And the plump shoulders
shnnl- acoin o

“So you didn't honeymoon like that?” per-
sisted the friend, and Mrs. Robin’s blue eyes
opened widely.
“My dear girl, can you imagine me in a tiny
house-boat with no maid to do my hair, and drink-
ing tea at a picnic, and getting horribly sunburned.
No, Robin and I had a very sensible and very
delightful honeymoon—the Australia for a week,
and then on to Melbourne for the Cup, at which I
wore a Paquin frock and Robin backed the
winner. We had dances and theatres and bridge
parties every night of our lives. Ido hope and
trust that Fred Gordon won’t take Robin seriously.
I must say I had no idea he could be so poetical.
Let us listen—perhaps he will describe an ideal
wedding now ! ”
But Robin Bell had nothing to say of a wedding.
ETHEL MILLS
The Gun.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE was once a gun that stood in
the window of a second-hand shop in the
city. The attached tag said it was.a you-
might-pay-more-and-get-an-inferior-weapon sort of
gun. And that tag was not lying. It hung per-
pendicularly, suspended by a string from the
trigger, tu.' .. *bo additional information that
the article was cheap, belt "/liable. And the gun
continued to stay there, and entered I.do competi-
tion with the oldest inhabitant..
One day, a young, man walked into the second-
hand shop. He had an egg-shaped i,' \ and the
extensive knowledge of firearms that a 10 year
sojourn behind the counter in the lace department
of a dry-goods store gives anyone. He wanted to
buy a gun. The shopman smiled the comprehen-
sive shopman-smile, and, handing him the weapon
so splendidly described above, said he thought it
would suit the young man. The young man
thought so too.
What the gun thought isn’t known, but it must
have been something damnable. It was the sort
of gun that if a fellow handled it when it was
loaded he took an even-money chance of being
likewise.
The young man took the weapon to his residence.
His first Saturday afternoon off he loaded it and
said to his wife with an affected air of indifference
and absolute lack of enthusiasm : “My dear, I will
go out and shoot something” ; and as he stepped
briskly away from the house he decided that he
would shoot only game.
The young man tramped the bush for many
hours, and didn’t see enough game to cause a stir
in a glassware emporium.
He relaxed. Really it was unnecessary for him to
be so fastidious. He would shoot any ordinary-
sized bird.
It was the bird’s day at home. As the young
man was making his way home with no excess
possessions but the loaded gun and a bad temper,
he spied a bird, that had just come out for the
afternoon, sitting on a tree. It was of the tricky,
now-my-tail-is-up, now-my-tail-is-down variety,
and considerably larger than a pea-nut. The
young man said to himself that he would
steal upon the creature until he was within easy
firing distance, and he started in to do the doubled -
up pedestrian act.
Slowly and cautiously the man raised the gun
to his shoulder and took aim.
Bang !
The man was true-blue. He kept his promise
to his wife. He did shoot something,
(Interval of two days.)
A funeral is leaving the residence of the person
with the egg-shaped head, and the little bird is up
in the tree wondering what has become of the man
that made that amusing noise,
JOHN PHILIP COOK.


Mr. Barnes’ Brother George.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE ain’t nothin’ in this ’ere
fortune-tellin’ business,” said Mr.
Barnes, with conviction. “Never yet
’ave I seen eny good come of it. I ’ad a painful
experience meself.
“It was up North, at the Mount Arthurst
fields. I remember well I was settin’ outside me
ut by meself—me mate bein’ away acrost the
ranges at the time. Things wuz pretty crook
with us, and I wuz doin’ a bit of ’ard thinkin’ ’ow
I wuz to tear a few more weeks’ credit outer the
quartz-’arted storekeeper—when I ’ears footprints.
I looks up, and there wuz a tall, benevolent ole
gent very respectable ’e looked, with some’at of
the Elijah Dowie ’bout the cut of ’is whiskers.
‘“Air you Mister James Barnes?’ ’e arst,
politely. Now, ’e didn’t look like a bailiff or
a ’tec, so I admitted I was. An’ ’e said,
Allow me my cyard ’ —pullin’ a bit o’ paper
outer a toffy-lookin’ wallet an’ ’andin’ it to me. I
turned it over a few times. It ’ad some fancy
writin’ on one side, but what with the bad light
an’ not bein’ much of a scholard, I couldn’t make
enythin’ of it. ‘ What’s it good fer ? ’ I inquired,
and/n’ it back. ’E took it, stuck out ’is chest and
read, ‘Professor Ebenezer ,.onzola
Society Entertainer, Plairvoyant, Palmist and
Thought-Reader.
" ‘ Air you that cove ?’ [ arst. ‘ The same,’ sed
’e. ‘ You air uncommon talented, Profess,’ I sed ;
You must be the bloke tvot’as plastered this ’ere
town with them song-an’-dance colored
posters ? Wat kin fdo fer you ? ’
I will toll you, sed ’e. l ls money—big
money—-f eny use to yu ?'
“‘Did I ’ear you mention money?’ sed I.
‘ ’Cause, if so, it’s a welkum sound. I ain’t seen
the price of a drink fer longer ’n I care to think
about. You ’aven’t a sample by you, I s’pose ? ’
“ ‘No,’ sed ’e, ’astily, ‘not jist at present. But
if you care to stand-in with me in the plan I will
explain to you, you will earn enuf for to ’ave a
bath in beer, if that’s your fancy.’ I jumped up
an told im to take a seat and explain. He sat
down and stroked his long white whiskers, and
eyed me'sif I was a four-course dinner.
“ ‘ I ani Roin’ ter give a entertainment ’ere ter-
morrer night, an’ I want your assistance,’ ’e said.
Well,’ I tole ’im, ‘I ain’t much of a ’and at
a song, but I kin do a clog-darnce what the bovs
say ’
“ ‘Tut, tut, man !’ ’e sez, impatient. ‘You’re
wastin’ time. I wan’t ’elp of a different sort.’
Well, arter swearin’ me to secrecy by the most
’orrible and blud-curdlin’ oaths, and arter peerin’
all round like a ferret or a two-up school spy, he
unfolded his scheme. It wuz beautifully simple
—not, ’zactly ’onest, mind yer; but, then, I wuz
dead ’ard-up, and I see’d me way to make a good
few quid, an’ no one the wiser. Anyhow, I agreed
to ’is proposal, an’ we shook ’ands on it solemn-
like.
“ ‘ But ’ow did you come to pick onto me to ’elp
you in sich a—well, doobious scheme ?’ I enquired.
“ ‘ I ’eard as you weren’t zactly perticler,’ ’e re-
plied.
t Now, don t you go fer ter call me names,
’cause I won’t stand it,’ I sez, ’otly.
“ ‘ Oo’s callin’ names ?’ sez ’e.
* * * *
“Next night I went down early to the barn
where th entertainment wuz to come orf, an’ got
a good position in front. Long before eight the
place was packed tight as a drum, and lots wuz
turned away frum ther door. Most of ’em climbed
onto the roof and tore holes in the thatch, so as
not to miss the only entertainment the place ’ad
’ad for nine months. In doin’ so they smothered
the people underneath with dust and muck, which
led to some unpleasantness. Arter the atmos-
phere had cleared some’at, and the audience
ad finished coffin’ the roof frum their lungs, the
Profess came forward—got-up very class,’ an’
interdooced ’imself. There’s no need to tell you
about ’ow that wenerable ole gent played th’
accordeon, an’ sang, an’ tole stories what ’urt yer
throat larfin’. Some of ’em on top larfed so much
that they nearly fell through on us. Next ’e
throws a kind o’ fit an’ goes orf inter a trance.
Then ’e began tellin’ us about the speerits o’ the
dead what wuz in the place, till our hair riz and
our teeth rattled like windlasses. (The two
kerosene lamps ’ad been put low.) J E wuz a
caution—no mistake ! Presently ’e ’az another fit,
and begins to pick out different ones of the boys,’
an’ tells ’em things about the past—all true, too—
that fairly made ’em gasp. Then ’e giv’ a sorter
extra twinge, an’ sittin’ bolt upright on the floor
(where ’e’d fallen) ’e passed ’is ’and several times
acrost ’is brow. ’E fixed ’is eyes on me with a
stony stare where I sat near the front, very
nervous—an’ appeared ter git excited. ’E kept
on lookin’ at me till everybody in the place begun
to look too. I felt pretty uncomfortable, I ken
tell you. Arter a few minutes o’ that, ’e sed, in a
strained, loud voice, ‘Stand up.’ I stood.
Your name, e muttered dreamily, ‘is
Barnes—George Barnes—no, no—not George—
Jim—yes, Jim Barnes. There is a speerit speakin’
to me. It is your brother George ’ (I never ’ad no
brother that I knows of) *’e died in Africa las’
week. ’E bids me tell you that you must go to
Africa at onst —at onst. You are to find out a
black man o’ the name o’ ‘ Porfephybaboo’ ’e
will take you to your brother George’s grave.
From that you must measure three paces to the
north, six to the west, and thirteen to the south.’
The Profess stopped speakin’ fer full five minutes,
during which there was not a sound in the whole
place. Then ’e gives a kick and starts orf agen.
* You are to dig there till you come to a iron-
bound box containing £75,000 worth of dia’
“ The ole man stopped an’ toppled over back-
wards with a crash. Amidst the wildest excite-
ment, the boys crowded round me and carried me
in triumph to the pub, close ’andy. The rest wuz
easy—like takin’ matches from a blind man. The
boys fought like mad to git to me with their con-
tributions towards me travellin’-expenses, an’ to
go into partnership with me. We formed a com-
pany right there, an’ declared a dividend in ad-
vance. There wuz beer right up to the ankles—
an speeches too. I got up an’ tole ’em about me
brother George (what I never ’ad), ’ow good I alius
wuz to ’im, things what ’e uster do and say as a
kid, ow fond ’e wuz o’ me an’ muvver—it near
made me cry.
At last we all went ’ome, an’ there wuz me on
me road to me lonely, ’umble, little ’ut (what I’d
left six hours before, stony), a Limited Liability
Co., with near three hundred quid weighin’
down me pockets an’ makin’ me lurch all
over the shop. It wuz a fairish walk from the
pub to my ’ut—our claim wuz pretty far away
from the township, standin’ by itself in a gully.
As I walked along I begun to think of what I
should do with all that money. Of course I would
have to clear away from the Arthurst fields—that
wuz no great loss. Then all o’ a sudden a chill
feelin’ crept up me spine.
I ad clean fergot the Profess, and my
agreement with ’im ! It made me feel side to
think that I would ’ave to give the ole shark ’arf.
Why should I ? Did the boys lend me the brass
to share wi’ ’im ? No, certintly not. They give
it me on account o’ me brother George, and ’cause
they wuz fond o’ me. It would be dishonest
to share it wi’ a stranger. ‘ So,’ I decided,
‘Mr. Profess, you won’t connect wi’a penny o’’
my cash. To-morrow I’ll be far away.’ I reached
the ’ut, went inside an’ lit the lamp. I ’ad just
hauled the bag o’ treasure from me kick, an’ ’ad
put it in the blankets in me bunk when I ’ears a
noise be’ind me.
“ ‘ I congratulate you on ther success o’ our
scheme,’ sed a voice. I tell you I near dropped
wi’ terror—an’ I ain’t by no means what you’d call
nervous. There wuz the ole Profess settin’ in the
corner, calm as could be.
‘‘ ‘I see you ’ave the cash all right,’ ’e sed.
“ Well, I admit I wuz a bit flabbergasted at
first ; you see, I ’adn’t expected ’im to wait for
me like that. It meant changing me tactiks. ‘ ’Oo
the ’ell are you, an’ wat are yer doin’ ’ere? ’ sed I
turnin’ on ’im.
So thet’s the game, is it ? ’ ’e snarled, an’ I
must say I didn’t like the look on ’im. Still ’e
wuz an ole man—though a large-sized ’un—an’ I
wuz pretty certin ’e ’ad brought no one along wi’
’im. That would ’a meant more to share the
plunder. So I felt fairly confident o’ cornin’ out
of any argument right side up. That wuz where
I fell in. Then things ’appened quickly. He
dodged round the packin’ case what we used fer
a table, an’ rushed at me. I let drive at ’im wi’
me left. ’E ducked like a flash an’grabbed me
round the middle. I got one arm round’is neck
and wi’ the other I got a hoist onto ’is whiskers.
Kill me ded, but they cum orf in me ’and ! An’
willainous ’e did look widout ’em—not old at all.
A bloke about my time o’ life —not thirty. Well,
I waz so ’stonished, I muster relaxed me grip, fer
quicker nor thinkin’ ’e draws orf —I felt ’sif a earth-
quake ’ad struck me on the jore—then I went ter
sleep.
“I woke up a few hours later, misdoubtin’
whether I wuz a shipwreck or only a rail-
way accident. The place wuz be’avin’ like a
circus. ’Course the bag o’ treasure ’ad vamoozed,
but there wuz a tray-bit and a note on the table.
As I said, I warn’t much of a scholard, but I spelt
it out arter a while:—
“ ’Dere Mister Barnes, —Inclosed please find cash in
payment for yer val’able services rendered.
Y’rs in ’aste,
Prof. Ebenezer Cradbrook Gonzora, alias ’Arry the
Binoer, spiritualist, etc., etc.
' P-S.—Love to Brother George.”
“’Arry the Ringer—the biggest take-down in
the Southern ’Emisphere. I ’ad run myself
a snag, no error.
“I wouldn’t ’ave minded so much ’avin’ bin
beaten by a better man if the boys ’adn’t made
such a fuss. Wanted me to give ’em their money
back ! Sif I could ’elp it. J
“No, I never seen ’mi since.
“ Yes, I think I will ’ave a drink, an’ thank you.”

SITTING OUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
C>HALL toe sit here in the gloom
While the waltz goes on ?
It is cooler than the room,
Being here alone;
We, who have so much to say —
Much to talk about.
Pleasant, while 'old tunes they play ,
To be sitting out.
How the music throbs anew
O’er the rush of feet,
As I sit and look at you,
Self-possessed and sweet,
Through the palms the lantern’s light
Flickers round about,
Casting multi-colors bright
Where we’re sitting out.
Ah, the haunting foolish air
That they’re dancing to
Makes me almost think I care
Very much for you.
Gracious lips and smiling eyes ,
Where can lie a doubt ?
Haunting memory almost dies
While we’re sitting out.
If I spoke to-night, methinks
I could banish quite,
While the dying music sinks,
Other eyes as bright.
Ah, the gay waltz dies away,
JEnds the merry rout,
Through the open door the day
Finds us sitting out.

On the Great Star Plain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was midnight on the Great Star Plain,
and a Wind that never ceased or slackened
swept from the gleaming gate across the
dark spaces. Every now and then it would over-
come and carry away with it a white wisp of
speechless, struggling ghost that flapped helplessly
for a moment like washing in a storm, ere it was
whirled into the air and away.
A lone Soul sank into a sitting posture behind a
hummock of cloud, and clutched its knees.
The stars, like ten thousand searchlights,
blazed down the limitless glacis of cloud at a tiny
tangle of lights and dark patches—the Earth.
And the Wind—which was really the breath of a
£°d grappled with the swarms of vagrant ghosts
and blew them out of sight.
So the minutes went by, and the fat Soul
thought—for the first time in many years.
“ How terrible !” it moaned at last. “ Oh, how
terrible ! ”
“What calls?” crooned the Wind, as it circled
about the Soul’s refuge. “ What calls ? ”
“ I called, ” said the Soul, and shrank further
back into the shadow.
“ What are you ?” asked the Wind, still on the
move and eager to be gone.
“ In life my name was Smith.”
“ This isn’t life, you dolt; what are you ? ”
“ I—l suppose I’m a ghost.”
“ Of course you are, or you wouldn’t be here.
But what are you?”
“Do you mean what was I?” asked-the dis-
tracted Soul.
“What you were you still are. Hurry,” said
the Wind.
“Well, then”
“Yes?”
“I was”
“What?”
“A politician,” mumbled the Soul.
For a moment the Wind stopped. Then it
spun round its captive again and chanted :
“ What ballast have you, 0 Soul ? ”
“ Ballast ? ”
“Have you anything of sufficient weight or
worth about you that will lie heavy in the tail-
pocket of your robe and keep me from blowing
you out ? Tell me, 0 Soul ?”
“ But how shall I know ? ” wailed the fat ghost.
“Feel your robe, O Soul.”
The shade of the politician dived a trembling
hand into the pocket of its garment and drew out a
handful of ashes.
“Broken pledges,” moaned the Wind, and
puffed them out of its palm.
The ghost felt again, and drew out the shade of
a seltzogene, which had no weight, but which
spluttered with an exhausted sound when the
trigger got tangled in its sleeve.
“Fifty years of speeches,” sighed the Wind.
‘ ‘ Fifty years of ”
But the ghost rose and waved its disengaged
arm—the one that wasn’t holding the bottle.
“How dare you!” it shouted. “Confound
your insults ! What do you know of”
“I don’t know,” answered the Wind. “We
depend on the Bottling Department.”
“Do you mean to tell me this contains ”
“We take the certificate of the Department.
You’ll find it gummed on the bottle.”
“Liars!” screamed the enraged Soul, and
shook its fist at the air. The sleeve of its robe
caught the trigger of the seltzogene, and the thing
hissed like a snake.
Don’t you want to stay ?” boomed the Wind,
rising very rapidly.
“No, I don’t!” came the answering yell of the
ghost.
“Don’t you want to feel in your pocket, O
Soul?” asked the Storm.
“ Feel! I’d rather frizzle in ”
Boom ! Even the concentrated glare of the stars
nickered for an instant in the fearful blast which
drowned the final word.
Half-an-hour later a white moth with a reputa-
tion for wisdom crawled out of a heap of moondust
and looked down at the Earth.
“ Vanity ! ” said the Moth; “ all vanity ! ” and
crawled in again.

The Man From Maoriland.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hlii S found in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,
Adelaide, and Perth ;
He loves to praise the land which had the honor
of his birth—
That beautiful, most splendid, most delightful
spot on earth,
That serene terrestrial Paradise—Otago.
He tells you of the scenery. The mountain-peaks
and crags ;
The waterfalls and thermal springs ! His ardor
never flags.
The lovely Maori maidens! (who have mouths
like carpet-bags !)
Oh, there’s nothing in creation like his island !
I took him to the mountains and I showed him
Govett’s Leap.
His odious comparisons would make a wombat
weep !
We went to Bathurst, Goulburn, Armidale, when
fares were cheap.
But of course they couldn’t be compared to
Christchurch.
He granted that the horses in the Melbourne Cup
were fair.
The stake was fairly decent, in a measure, as it
were !
But still the course at Flemington no person could
compare
With the splendid course they had at Taranaki!
We went away to Gippsland, where the forest
giants grow ;
They were nothing to the kauri pine near Grey-
mouth—oh dear no !
Once we went to Kosciusko when there’d been a
fall of snow;
But he said the snow was'whiter in Dunedin !
I took him down the harbor —Sydney harbor,
understand—
’Twas moonlight, calm and lovely ; it was fairy-
like and grand !
I begged for some approval from the man from
Maoriland —
But ’twas nothing to a night on Wanganui!
I pointed to the spangled dome ; the radiant star-
lit sky;
The beaming moon’s most kindly light;
clouds floating by !
All these, I thought, he must admire, but this was
his reply :
“ Loud ! You ought to see the moon we’ve got
in Auckland ! ”

Father Dyin'.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A
VISION'OE
CA'LVA'RY.
/ HAD an evil dream:
The Great Sea moaned for breath;
The Great Green Earth did seem
Grey in the grasp of Death.
The sky was dark with doom,
But, in the vault afar,
There, glittering through the gloom,
A single smiling star.
Upon the Mount of Loss
I saw a vision dread —
Satan astride the Cross
In hose and doublet red.
With mockery and with mirth
His sombre visage shone;
The Kingdoms of the Earth
He seemed to gaze upon.
He gave the royal sign,
And looked down with sad scorn
Upon the Head Divine
Crowned with its Grown of Thorn.
Then to that Figure Wan
Approached a tall full-fed
Roman Centurion —
A mitre on his head.
He shed no useless tear,
But, cold and solemn-eyed,
With a long crozier-spear
He pierced the Saviour’s side.
And from that side there ran,
Most wondrous to behold,,
Through all the lands of Man
A stream of ruddy gold.
Through long dim centuries
It ran, a river unde,
And men with chalices
Sat down its banks beside.
Men clad in mystic gear —
Mitre and shovel-hat —
For many and many a year
They quaffed it and grew fat.
Still on the Mount of Loss,
In evil dreams I see
Satan astride the Cross,
Smiling in mockery.
But in the vault afar,
Gleaming the Cross above,
I see the Smiling Star
I hat is the Star of Love.

Father was dyin’.
There weren’t anything particular the matter
with him ;he just seemed fizzling away. Heart-
broken, the doctor said.
Dad dyin’ of heartbreak! And it was him as
was always the cheeriest of us, and used to make
Mum so wild, everlastingly saying everything was
sure to come right; how the rain was absolutely
certain to come this season—couldn’t help it; and
then he’d say he would get the wheat paddock
under and put a few taters in, and something for
us to go on with as soon as it came down. But it
never did come down, and he’d go around looking
a little.grimmer about the mouth, thinking what
he’d do next season, and Mum would say, “I told
you so.” That had gone on for years and years.
I can never remember when we had enough water
or enough of anything much.
It was the bush fire that finished Dad. As a
rule he perked up quickly after anything had
happened ; he did when the sheep went, and our
fowls, and all but our last cow, and the rest of the
worries that came. It w ‘•'ot bush fire. We
worked like demons, all of us, but it lick
every bit of fencing, our sheds and outhouses, and
started on the houce. only the wind slewed around
in time. Father gave one rmrowful look at the
sky, Covered' in great glittering, billowy clouds
that seemed mocking us (it often worked up as r
a great storm was coming on, and then gradually
melted away, just to spite us), and then he caved
in, lay down just like an old horse, and didn’t
seem to have any heart to gel A , ‘gai,..
One dull evening (the sky was all covered with
the mocking clouds) mother, with a stony look on
her face, came and hunted us all up and told us
we had better go in and see father. We went in,
and as I looked back I saw her sink in a sort of
helpless way against the verandah-post.
Father kissed the kids. “ Bill,” he said to me,
“you’ll have to look after them all now until
they can go on their own. Perhaps the rain’ll
come sometime” (with a weary sigh); “you and
Mary—wife, where are you ? ” —feeling about the
bed.
I went out to fetch her. There was a smell
around such as I had only smelt once or twice in
my life, but I knew it at once. The rain had
come. “Poor old Dad!” I thought, and the
choking feeling in my throat was awful. Mother
clutched my shoulder. “Do you see that? ” she
panted, pointing to the fine, steady, gentle, soak-
ing rain.
“ That’s what I’ve prayed for till my knees are
sore —prayed for always ; and now, when it’s killed
Jerry waiting for it, it’s come. Bill,” she said, in
a whisper, “it’s better to think there ain’t a God
and it’s all chance, than to believe there is one,
and He’s let this happen on purpose.” Then she
burst out crying—poor old mother. I put my
arms around her and told her Dad wanted her.
She mopped her face at once and as we went in,
I gave a look around; it was good to see it soaking
'"'“We must keep it from him, Bill,” said mother,
anxiously whispering.
Father had his eyes shut. “Is that you,
Mary ?” he said. “ Come near, old girl.”
Mother went and put her arms about him. The
kids started blubbering, and none of us knew
much what to do, so we just hung about the bed
and waited.
“They’re all going to be good uns, Mary, an
do what you tell ’em,” he said.
The children were nudging each other and look-
ing knowing. At last, Tom blurts out, “ I say,
Dad, it’s rainin’,” before I could clap my hands
over his mouth, and the little ones wriggled out
one by one to see it. Some of them had never
seen rain before.
Bit Dad had only caught the word “rain.”
“Mary,” he said, “it seems awful selfish in me
ttf be slippin’ out of it all and leavin’ you like this,
but” (whispering) “that other land ain’t no
blessed golden place. It’s just rainin’ a good ’un
there. Oh, I can hear it; it’s beautiful.”
It wasn’t remarkable he heard it, considering
it was banging on the iron roof like hailstones. It
seemed a most awful thing—Dad dying just as the
rain came.
“I can almost smell it,” said Dad, “givens
your hand, Mary, and you, Bill,” and he lay still
and held our hands for a long while with his eyes
shut. We kept quiet, listening to the patter and
hoping he wouldn’t find out. Presently the rain
began to find out the cracks and crannies of the
bouse, and the roof started leaking directly over
the bed, and a great drop comes splash on Dad’s
nose. Dad thought it was mother crying, and
squeezed her hand tighter, and murmured some-
thing, but when another came lie opened his eyes
and saw it couldn’t come from either of us. Then
he looked around a bit puzzled, and searched
about with his eyes, and at last spied where it
came from with a bewildered look.
“Why, it’s rainin’,” he said incredulously.
Mother couldn’t keep it any longer; she burst
out into great sobs. “ Oh, Jerry, don’t mind, it’s
come and now you’re goin’ away,” and the children
who were running in and out set up a dismal wail.
Dad rose up impatiently, and rushed to the
door.
“S’help me God, it is !” he cried, coming back.
“ What are you catching it in?” (briskly).
“Catching it in! We ain’t thought of that,”
we said, stupidly. Then Dad, as he rushed his
clothes on, cursed us all for a lot of silly fools. _
“ Hanging around here whinging and whining,
and letting the damned water, now it has come,
just run to waste all over the place. Yer ain’t
got no blessed heads. ’Ere you” (to me) “you
just clap something under the big spout and clean
out the gutters and make a start, or I’ll lick yer.”
“Father, father, you mustn’t go out in your
state,” I heard Mum say, and Dad roared out:
“My state! Damn it; ain’t it enough to make
a man in a state to have all that whining goin’ on
round him,” and giving a last tug at his coat, he
rushed out, and we worked around cleaning out
the roof gutters and seeing to all the tanks, and
Dad told Mum to go and cook up anything that
was left, ’cause he could get fresh tick to-morrow.
The doctor looked in, as he had promised, on
his way from Mrs. Smith’s, late in the evening,
just as we were tucking into the fried pumpkin
and hot scones. Dad was eating like a horse, and
mother looked on anxious, not knowing whether
to laugh or cry.
“ Well, I’m damned ! ” the doctor said, and he
fell to also.

FRANTIC WITH PAIN.
Cured of Neuralgia
After Years of Torture by
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
“No one under Heaven ever had Neuralgia
worse than I had. That would have been abso-
lutely impossible. It wore me down to a wreck,
and drove me to the verge of madness. When
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured me, they can cure
the worst case of Neuralgia in this world. There’s
no doubt about that.” That is the solemn, sworn
statement of Mrs. Margaret Purkis, Thorne and
Forsyth Sts., Newtown, Wagga Wagga.
“I used to be a plump, healthy woman till my
blood got out of order,” said Mrs. Purkis. “ Before
long my nerves broke down—and then the Neu-
ralgia started. Sharp burning pains nagged and
dragged at my nerves till I writhed and screamed
with the agony. The pains in my head were just
like stabs from red-hot table-knives. The nerves
in my arms and bddy felt as if they were being
torn from my flesh with burning pincers. For
weeks I could get no rest. One bad attack lasted
for four months. And all this time I lay paralysed
with pain. I could not move from my bed.
“ The agony was so terrible that I nearly
lost my reason,” Mrs. Purkis continued. “It
was only from sheer exhaustion that I ever
slept. I could not eat solid food at all.
Every time I opened my mouth, a piercing
pain tore through my head and face till every
nerve seemed on fire. Even when the Neuralgia
was not nearly so bad as it often was, there were
days when I could not leave my bed through
weakness and pain. People would come in and
go out of the house, and I would never know they
were there. At times I seemed to be unconscious
of everything but my terrible, fiendish sufferings.
At other times I was so irritable that I could not
bear the children near me. If they walked across
the floor every footstep sent a fresh spasm of pain
through me.
“All my housework had to be left undone,”
Mrs. Purkis added. “I had to depend upon the
kindness of the neighbors to do whatever was
absolutely necessary. When I was well enough
to leave my bed, the Neuralgia had so drawn up
the nerves of my arm that I could not raise it to
comb my hair. I used to rave up and down the
room like a maniac, frantic with pain. For a year
I hardly ever had my head out of flannels. I tried
all kinds of medicines, but nothing was of any use.
Ordinary treatment failed even to ease the pains.
My case baffled doctors and everyone else.
“I was worn to a wreck when one day my little
girl brought me home a book tilling how Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People cured Neur-
algia. It said they actually made new blood—-and
that good red blood was really the food of the
nerves. The cases they had really cured were
just like my own, only not so bad—so I picked
up hope. ‘lf Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured these
poor people after everything else failed, I don’t
see why they can’t cure me,’ I said. So I sent to
Williams the chemist, in Fitzmaurice-street, for a
supply of these blood-building pills.
“ The very first box gave me a better appetite
than I had had for months,” Mrs. Purkis con-
eluded. “Soon I noticed my nerves weie a bit
steadier. Gradually the color came back to my
cheeks and new strength to my legs. I began to
brighten up and look after my house again. The
children’s noise no longer worried me and 1 gained
in weight. Before long two or three days would
pass and I wouldn’t have a twinge of Neuralgia.
At last I was completely cured. Since then I
have never had a touch of Neuralgia even in the
coldest weather. Now I tell everyone that when
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured me they can cure
anybody.”
Mrs. Purkis’ case is only one of hundreds.
Among your own neighbors you will find cases
just as wonderful, in which Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills have struck at the root of other blood diseases
like anaemia, indigestion, rheumatism, sciatica,
backache, kidney disease, liver complaint, head-
aches, and the special secret sufferings of growing
girls and women when the regularity of their blood
supply is deranged. Remember Dr. Williams
Pink Pills do not act on the bowels. They do one
thing only, but they do it well—they actually
make new blood. If you are not sure whether
your special trouble is caused by bad blood or not,
write for free med.cal advice to the Dr. Williams
Medicine Co., Queens’ Place, Sydney. Prom the
same address you can order the genuine Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills by mail—2s. Od. a box, six

JUL EOPLE
Koponey’s Island.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHAT its official title is I have
never ascertained, but it was known
to us as Koponey’s Island,” said Jim,
who was nicknamed Webster.
“ Never mind the title ; let’s ’ave the yarn,”
said one.
“With the greatest animosity,” Jim returned,
taking his coat-tails in his arms and seating him-
self on a portion of the wood-heap. “We had
been on a job-hunting expedition for about six
months, when we came to a big depression in the
landscape that had an upheaval in the middle of
it like a camel’s hump. The road snaked off in
two directions to circumnavigate it, and I sat back
in the breeching at the fork for a minute while
Murty Brown brushed up his bump of locality.
“‘By cripes, Jim, we’ve hit it!’ he says.
‘We’vehit it ! ’he repeats, in capitals, and heaves
his roof at the bifurcation.
“ ‘ Hit what ? ’ says I.
“ ‘See that atoll in the middle of the lake, with
a fringe of lignum round it, an’ one bushy tree for
top-dressin’ ? ’ says Murty. ‘ That’s Koponey’s
Island.’
“‘I don’t quite comprehend,’ I says. ‘The
decorative item is certainly obtrusive, but the lake
eludes me.’
“ ‘ You’re the two ends of an ass, Jim,’ he says.
‘ All this dumped-in vicinity is a lake when it’s
full. S’far’s I know, this is th’ first time it’s been
struck thirsty since Koponey navigated it in a bark
canoe, and went into recess on that atoll. An’,
seein’ as how we’re only shoein’ the shoemaker at
present, I think we might do worse’n go into
recess there ourselves. It’s quite on the cards
that we’ll discover something. I ’apj en to know,
at any rate, that Koponey took a valuable cargo
across with him ; an’ I’ve reason to believe he left
it there.’
“ ‘ Please to elucidate,’ I says, as Murty charged
down on the concavity. ‘ Who was this Admiral
Koponey person, anyhow ?’
“ ‘He was a spry chap as lived by his wits,
Jim. Haunted back towns an’ shanties, an’ took
down honest bushmen like you an’ me at ha-aid
an’ other games, when they were shikkered, an’
bought their live-stock an’ jool’ry for nex’ to
nothing when they were cleaned-out an’ ’ad an
extra-special desire to fill ’em up agin. Plenty o’
jokers knockin’ around like Koponey ; they do a
bit o’ tommyhawkin’ at shearin’ time, an’ lay up
with gammy wrists about three days a week ; but
Koponey never tackled hard graft at all. He
worked the sheds with French photos., and lay by
at the shanties like a spider waitin’ for flies. His
French specials were real pure. ’Twas them, an’
some cronk bizness with a cheque, that set the
traps after his scalp. He got wind of it, an’ made
tracks across a multitude o’ territ’ry at short
notice. One evenin’, he camped at a muddy
waterhole on Sandy Brannon’s, an’ while he’s
there a nice, fat hogget gets bogged. ’Twas rotten
luck, Koponey seel; th’ darned thing couldn’t get
mud-hobbled only just when he ’appened to be
there. Of course, it suggested fresh chops for
breakfast, an’, bein’ in a lonesome place, Koponey
extracted it as an act of mercy, an’ led it to the
slaughter. ’Ad it skinned an’ slung up, an’ was
just openin’ it down nicely, when Sandy Brannon
an' one o’ the men rode slap on to him. It was a
desp’rate case, an’ needed desp’rate measures.
Koponey outs with a revolver in one hand an’ a
pound-note in the other. ‘ I was starvin’ when I
pulled that sheep out o’ the bog an’ killed it,’ he
says, ‘ but I know that won’t save me. Take the
quid an’ leave me alone, an’ I’ll be off your run be-
fore sundown.’ ‘ All right, me man,’ says Brannon,
an’ rode off without takin’ the quid. Then Koponey
slipped his anchor an’ made a dinnyaiser for this
lake. He ’ad a pile o ’ money on him, besides a
swag o’ jool’ry, an’ he shipped it to that island in a
bark canoe. Hid there for a couple o’ months,
then cleared out-back, leavin’ everything behind
him. He meant to come back in a year or two,
dig up his plant, an’ go into business somewhere
in a new quarter. But he got smashed up in a
mining accident—where he’d tackled work for th’
first time, I b’lieve, in his born days. I ’appened
to be workin’ mates with him, an’ when he knew
he was booked for a brighter sphere, he ups an’
tells me about his treasure. ‘ It’s on a little island
in th’ middle of a lake,’ he says. ‘There’s one
bushy tree on it, an’ a fringe of lignum round it.’
An’ that there eminence, Jim, is'accordin’ to pro-
scription, ain’t it ? ’
“ ‘ Omitting the trifling matter of a wet circum-
ference,’ I says, ‘ I’ll allow the similarity is con-
spicuous ; but what are the precise bearings of the
lake as mapped out by the lamented Koponey ? ’
“ ‘Never mapped ’em,’ says Murty. ‘He col-
lapsed right at th’ lignum fringe. That’s why
I’ve been ten years, off an’ on, explorin’ Australia
an’ ploddin’ round every darned lake I ever heered
on. Give up all hope long ago; an’ here I run
slap on to the blessed situation when I’m not
givin’ it a thought. By cripes, Jim, you an’ me’s
in for something special.’
“ ‘ I hope it will develop as you prognosticate,’
I says, as we lands on the lake’s protuberance.
Its population was a wedge-tailed eagle. We
ousted him, and took possession with due formula.
As a quiet place for a Quaker’s residence, Kopo-
hey’s Island was sublime. There was water at
one extremity, but the wood supply was painfully
abbreviated. The eagle had most of it up the
tree, and we commandeered that with promptness.
While I rigged the tent and boiled the billy,
Murty was chopping up the island with a toma-
hawk—which comprised our mining outfit. It
was a sight for sore eyes to see the bottled-up
energy escaping from him. But the treasure
eluded him that night, and it was ten days before
he got a renewal of his mineral license. It
rained—rained for 36 solid hours; and when we
upended ourselves on the second morning, we
found the blessed deluge had marooned us. The
lake was full, and an obstreperous bullock had
materialised on the premises.
“At first we rather congratulated ourselves on
his approximateness, but when he introduced him-
self, in his robes of office, we weren’t quite so

SHE: “ How's that?"

conclusion that we would have to assimilate him
sooner or later, you understand; besides, we

became so demonstrative at first sight of us that
"e removed to the eagle’s quarters without wait-
to get our hats. He im ve with much snort,
and established himself under the balcony, swmg-
ing his fly . ki ii er and talcing observations. We
christened him Pugnacity. He remained tlicre-
about for two hours, then went off a little way to
take in grass. He couldn’t go far without em-
bracing aquatics, as that blessed island was only
40yds .° and dep lorably attenuated in the
waist. Our roost centralised it. Murty slipped
down after his tomahawk, and he had just shinned
back out of reach when Pugnacity returned to
investigate.
* By cripes, 111 make cold meat of him, says
Murty, and he heaves the hatchet at him with
criminal intentions. It collided with his cranial
armament, bounced off, and revoluted into Lake
Monotony.

Koponey Island. Our pocket-knives were blunt
and wobbly in the blades, or we might have
managed with a stick and a bootlace to guillotine

men of the bovine genus I ever rubbed acquaintance
with> There was pkmtj of grass in our country
f or a day or two, and he had onl / to turn round
to lubricate. That would satisfy any respectable
quadruped ; but Pugnacity had been badly brought
U P‘ , ., e was bellicose by nature, and had
selfish ideas; and that hurt us all the more now
that we had
nothing to kill
him with. He
would haunt
our basement
for hours,
then go on
circuit duty
for a little
while, and take
refreshments ;
but as soon as
he saw us con-
nected with
his grass-plot
he would re-
sume hostili-
ties, and we’d
have to streak
for the eleva-
tor.
“ We got our
furniture aloft
before dark.
Sleeping o n
the same plane
with Pugna-
city was too
precarious.
Murty made a
hammock with
the tent, and
I construed
another out of
the blankets.
We hung our
ration- bags
and' parapher-
nalia about the
limbs, till that
blessed vege-
table looked
like a Christ-
mas tree. Pug-
nacity deposit-
ed himself
within call, in
case we fell
out, and conse-
quentlyMurty
retired with
disturbances
in his mind.
He annexed
the nightmare,
among other
catastrophes,
and kept the
community
awake with his
agony shrieks.
My lamps lit
on him in the
grey dawn as
he clutched a
handful of
hammock on
each side of
him, and pro-
spected the
universe for
calamities.
“‘Good
morning, Mur-
ty,’ I says;
‘ how are you
sagaciating ? ’
“ ‘By cripes,’says Murty, ‘it was real awful.
If I put in another night like the last I’ll die of
heart-disease. I wish that beast would emigrate.
I’d face starvation willingly if I could only ’ave a
bit of real estate to sleep on.’
“‘ It isn’t a very salubrious situation, I’ll
allow,’ I says, ‘ but it will be much more in juxta-
position if that fellow goes voyaging. He’s the
natural resources of this island, and we must
develop him somehow.’
“ ‘ I hope he’ll be developed soon,’ says Murty.’
“ ‘ We are unanimous on that identical point,’ I
says. ‘lf we concentrate our superior intelligence
on that desirable end, we are bound to accomplish
his bamboozlement in the course of time.’
“ Pugnacity was browsing at the north pole just
then, and we took the liberty to drop down and
make a fire. He was enjoying a good breakfast
evidently, but he left that when he saw me
appropriating a smajl decoction of the lake, and we
found it necessary to hurry upstairs again. We
boiled the billy, though, in spite of him. Murty
suspended that utensil over the fire with the tent-
rope, and when it boiled he just hauled it up, and
hung it intermediate so we could dip from our
respective allotments. Pugnacity remained con-
tiguous, with a resentful optic glued on the com-
bustion, and we had an argument on his driving
power, and discussed him generally from a
gastronomic standpoint. There were times when
we could crack jokes about the European situation,
and feel quite hilarious ; and then would come the
relapses when the thought of being evicted by a
cow’s u ncle would stir the bile in us, and cause an
ebullition of bad language. He regarded the
shade of our residence as his birthright, and when
the sun got hot he favored the neighbourhood with
much conspicuousness.
“We held out for five days, hammocked most
of the time, and taking exercise on the instalment
system between whiles. That put finality on our
menu card, and the sixth day found us with a
void that ached for the enemy. About noon Murty
crawled out of his hammock, and, dressed in a
week’s beard and some sunburn, dropped quietly
over the balcony.
“ ‘ What do you meditate?’ I says.
“ ‘l’m goin’ to fish out my tommy,’ says Murty.
‘ That disgruntled son of a cow’s ’ad the loan of us
long enough. Here goes ! ’
“Pugnacity was studying perspective seascape ;
but the first glimpse of Murty in his dismantled
state electrified him. He seenn dto regard him
as a fresh indignity, and focussed him with oppro-
brium till he had penetrated some quantity of
lake. We were confabulating with regard to the
whereabouts of the lost property, and didn’t ob-
serve his manoeuvres. When Murty turned, with
the piecious implement in custody. Pugnacity was
making demonstrations on the bank. Murty
jumped and ejaculated spontaneously.
“ ‘ My Gawd, Jim,’ he says, ‘ he’s got me ! ’
“‘Don’t alarm yourself,’ I says. ‘Transmit
that hatchet this way, and I’ll attack him in the
rear.’ Murty transmitted it. Then Pugnacity
heaved his bulk of contumacy at him, and Murty
precipitated himself into the lignum bushes. I
dropyaed down and acquired the had
to elevate again with express speed. The tan
talising beast wouldn't come to the sacrifice, and
he wouldn't despatcli himself far enough to re-
store confidence in Mr. Brown. He was more
aggressive than usual. Our residence was the
only comestible left on the island, and swimming
after lignum didn’t appear to be a habit of his, so
we got the benefit of his spare time —especially
Murty.
“ ‘This is awful,’ he says when he’d been trans-
fixed about two hours. ‘ Why don’t that atrocity
emigrate? Can’t you do something for me, Jim?’
“‘Unfortunately,’ I says, ‘ I have no influence
with the obstructionist. But we might contrive
to circumvent him between us. How’s your con-
stitution ? ’
“ ‘ I’m gettin’ th’ cramps,’ says Murty.
“ ‘ Well, that’s not too voluptuous, I'll allow,’ I
says. ‘ But keep your head up, and I'll guarantee
you’ll be relieved in less than a week.’
“‘l’ll be defunct before then,’ says Murty.
‘ Haven’t you enough ability about you-—a young
man like you—to decoy him further?’
“‘He decoys with too much velocity,’l says,
‘ when you consider the gradient of our staircase.
But if you’ll conduct yourself to the furthest
extremity, and make yourself attractive there,
I’ll be able to initiate something.’
“Murty set off wading round the island with a
disturbance in his dental department, and as soon
as he had got Pugnacity interested at the north
pole, I took the tent and rigged it on its gable
end near the water—temporarily, you understand,
so it would collapse and conglobulate on the
slightest provocation. Then I constructed art
effigy of Murty Brown, titivated him up in a red
shirt and a flamingo tie, and erected him in the
immediate foreground. I drew Murty s hat well
over his frontispie.ce, and introduced an eagle’s
feather to inrpart a military aspect. I had to
abbreviate the finishing touches, for old Pug-
nacity was coming along to interview the pro-
ceedings. His indignation, when he saw Dummy,
was even more emphatic than when Murty’s
nakedness was imposed on his sensibilities. He
approached with deliberate step, his cranium irr
the atmosphere, his olfactory orgarrs in full
blast, and murder scintillating in both eyes.
Dummy was a new sensation ; lie didn’t vamoose
like the other two-legged monstrosities on Kopo-
ney’s Island. He stood defiant, and Pugnacity
seemed to recognise that his reputation was at
stake. He craned forward to sample Dummy s
effluvium, and one prod igious snort nearly upset his
attitude. His tie fluttered, and the next instant
he struck the background with violence in six
places. The background fell over Pugnacity like
a winding-sheet, his horns hooked it, and, with a
frantic roar and a mighty upheaval, the conglome-
ration plunged into the lake. His departure and
Murty’s home-coming were contemporaneous.
“ ‘ How-wow-wow are yer ? ’ says Murty. Poor
chap was pretty nigh refrigerated.
“‘Oh, salubrious,’ I says. ‘ How are you ap-
preciating ? ’
“ ‘For Gawd’s sake, go an’ chop some steak off
him while I thaw meself,’ says Murty. ‘Me very
bones is petrified,’
“ The lamented Pugnacity had struggled into
deep water, and towing him into the shallows,
with his caudal appendage between my teeth, was
a distressing process. But we landed him eventu-
ally. We flayed him with the hatchet, and we
butchered him with the same instrument; and
four days subsequently we embarked in his cuticle
—which we scuttled on the main coast. It had
the station brand on the port bow.”
“ And what about the treasure? ”
“Well, as to that,” said Jim, who was nick-
named Webster, “ I won’t insinuate that Koponey
was a fabricator ; prospecting with a hatchet
didn’t do the man justice. But all we shipped
from that island were the foundation poles of
the eagle’s residence and a sun-dried hunk of
Pugnacity.”

The Song of the Underseas.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EAR is the first dull glow, and fair
m 1 The face of the stripling Day
M M Afiush, and his flooding amber hair —
When dark rides down ami away:
Yet I pine for the path where the Eight
Winds blow
And the shouldering sea-waste drones between
The spangled sands of the World I know
And the World I have never seen.
Here is my heart, where the rich plains roll,
Glad in the home it hath—
Forest and shallow and racing shoal,
Autumn and aftermath.
Stay ! —for a breath dreams down the breeze;
Still! —while my lute-strings lisp it low.
Thus are the songs of the Upper Seas
Sung in the World I Know.
Spun from the silk of silences,
Caught from the carmine west,
Feinting from phantomed forest-trees,
Filched from the wood-wind’s jest;
Laughter and fitfully whispered words,
Witchery borne from the winking star,
Dances that thrill from the throats of birds
For the motes in the sunlight-bar.
Such have I sifted and strung and wove,
Set to a song—my own,
Yet ever there wavers its beat above
A measure of notes unknown.
Passionate—sweet is the pulse of it,
Regal its shadowy symphonies,
The harp-voiced wraith of a song unwrit
Blown up from the Underseas.
“ Drift down ! Here the Orient flames in gold !
Dream down 1 Here the halcyon dew
Hangs jewelled on sun-slopes aeon-old,
Where the olden is ever new—
Distances rocked in a silver haze,
White ’neath the film of a folded veil;
Star-wove, and cupola-crests ablaze
In the luminous moon-mist pale !
“ Drift down, dream down ! On the atoll-rim
Where the rough seas rip and cross,
Where the chasing cloud-shades slide and swim
Round the idle albatross ;
’Mid odor of aloes and frankincense,
In groves where the dead gods smile and sit—
Sweet-lipped, soul-stripped of the old Pretence,
Ye may fathom the Song Unwrit! ”
Shall I slip to the shades of the Afterwhile,
Ere I buffet the breasting breeze
That lifts in the palms of the outer isle,

Rede me, O shore-swell plunging green ;
Riddle me, cloud-drift straight and slow;
This— is the World I hare never seen—
The World I shall never know !

JAS. A. ALLAN.
The Misfortunes of Jack, R.N.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ TyrO ! ” I was emphatic. I had heard
I y that story of navy serge before.
“ Thank-ee, sir,” he answered,
meekly, touching his cap ; “ but you’re missing
a bargain, sir.”
The action of salute looked genuine. This man
might have been a sailor after all. There was a
smack of the salt somewhere —a suggestion of an
old-time alertness which did not spell “Mercantile
Marine” either. But alas, against this was the
nose, a vivid color which is not encouraged in the
navy.
“ It is about grog-time/’ I suggested.
“Ay, ay, sir,” said he, brightening up. This
put the matter beyond a doubt. He was “ R.N.”;
for all good merchant-sailors are teetotallers,
having been brought up from early youth on lime-
juice by kind skippers who do not believe in grog
—when lime-juice is so much cheaper. You can
always tell the merchant-sailor, because he faints
if you offer him strong drink.
“Ah!” said the sailor, smacking his lips.
Then a shade of displeased reproach crept into
histone. “It was this, sir, wot brought me to
peddlin’ serge. I’d ha’ bin bo’s’n now only for
grog—and a quack doctor.”
I looked at him, bottle in hand, eyebrows inter-
rogative. He held out his glass. “Yessir, this,
and Dr. Porson, what used to in’abit a little ’ouse
in University-street.”
“You see, sir, I’d bin on the scoot, an’ my
engines began to work loose on the bed-plate.”
“Excellently suggested,” I said.
“Yessir. An’ my mate, ’earin' of this, give me
a—a coupon, you know, sir—one o’ those little
books with a picture of a bloke with ’is bilers
showin’, an’ tellin’ ye what time the stars rise, an’
stories about people what ’ad bin to see Dr. Por-
son, an’ ’e saved their lives. An’ it told ye to see
’im if you got that tired feelin’, fullness after
meals, ’eadaches, spots before the eyes, bad dreams;
all of which I ’ad. I was for patronisin’ the doc.
aboard, but my mate ’ad no faith in ’im since ’e
euchred ’im when ’e wanted to go into ’orspital
for a week’s rest. Bill, my mate, ’ad swallered
cordite, an’ the doc., after findin’ ’is range with a
thermometer, sent ’im in. So Bill reckoned as
’ow a doc. what didn’t know corditis when it
come under ’is eye, wouldn’t know enough to cure
me. He reminded rpe o’ the lives what Porson
’ad saved, an’ at last I reckoned that I’d see
Porson, an’ take no base imitations.
“So be’old me, one fine day, goin’ like a silly
goat to the slaughter. The doctor took a little
trumpet thing an’ put it to my chest. Then ’e
A CHEAP BURIAL.
PARSON : “My good lady, where were the remains of your late husband interred?”
WIDOW (sadly): “There were no remains, sir. He — he—preached the gospel to the cannibal
heathen.”
took out ’is watch an’ ’eld me pulse. When ’e’d
finished, ’e looked at me in a thoughtful way what
sent cold showers down me back.
“‘My man,’ says’e, ‘ it’s a good thing you come
to me. You are suffering from nerve-obstruction.
Another three months, an’ even my skill could not
save you. You wouldn’t ’ave ’ad a sound nerve in
your body ; every one would ’ave been stopped up
by the poisons which are slowly but surely accu-
mulatin’ in yer system. An’ that,’ he says, tap-
pin’ me on the arm with ’is trumpet, ‘ that would
mean death. Your vital junctions would all cease,
an’ you would die.’
“‘Functions,’ I hazarded.
“‘Yessir, p’raps it was. But, junctions or
functions, ’e did give me a proper fright. Then
’e started talkin’ abart the treatment ’e was pre-
pared to give me. But o’ course it would ’ave to
be paid for, he said. Could I pay for it ? I told
’im I ’ad about £3O in the Savings Bank.
“ ‘ ’Ow fortunate ! ’ said ’e. ‘My treatment will
be just £3o.’
“ Well, I bucked a bit at this. I told ’im that
the doctor aboard ’ud cure me for nothin’ ; and
that £3O was £3o—took a deal o’ savin’, and was
easy spent.
“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘’ow can you expect to be
cured by one o’ them cheap young doctors what
they ’ave aboard a man-o’-war? And ’ow much
use will yer £3O be to you when you’re dead?
Answer me that.’
“’E ’ad me there all right. But £3O
“ ‘ Lookee here, doc.,’ I said ; ‘ I ’aven’t quite
got £3O ; the exac’ war-footing is £2B 10s. G^d.’
“ ‘ Well,’ ’e replies/ ‘ I’ll do the square thing by
ye, my lad. I’ll cure ye for £2B 10s. The
don’t matter.’
“’E was right enough there, blast ’im. So, very
sorrowful, flag ’alf-mast, arms ’versed, I went to
draw my ’ard-earned savings. It was cruel. The
young chap be’ind the counter thought ’e’d score
off me, seein’ there was a lot o’ people abart.
“ ‘ ’Elio, Jack,’ ’e said ; ‘ goin’ ter get married ?’
“ ‘ Why, ’Arry ? ’ I said; ‘asn’tyer sister told
ye?’
“It got’im below the armor belt. ‘Get out
o’ this, ’ ’e said, ’is face like the port lamp.
“I turns round to the bloke next me. ‘Nice
thing, ain’t it, sir,’ I says, ‘for’im to forget as ’ow
this day me an’ ’is sister Jane is to be made one?’
Then I left.
“Almost as soon as I gets into the street I
meets my mate, Bill. We went an’ ’ad a couple,
for which I pays. I forgot as ’ow that money was
to go to the doc. An’ the more beer we ’ad the
more I forgot. That’s one effec’ of beer. I forgot
there was such a thing as a nerve in the whole of
my body. I forgot I ’ad only three months to
live.”
“You forgot,” I interrupted, “the stars, the
moon, the sun,
And you forgot the blue above the trees,
And you forgot the dells where waters run,
And you forgot the chilly Autumn breeze.”
“ Yessir, excep’ that it warn't Autumn, bein’ a
’ot day in November. ’Owever, nex’ mornin’
I found I ’ad only £25 or so left. What was
the use o’ that ? The doc. says £2B 10s. I
’adn’t got it. An’ I ’ad a throat on me, result
of fillin’ up the day afore. An’ then it struck
me what a fool I was, with three months to
live, £25 in my pocket, an’ said throat, to waste
that short time slavin’ for ’ls Gracious Ned Seven.
This idea, ’avin’ thoroughly soaked in durin the
mornin’s brass-cleanin’ and fire-stations drill, druv
me the next evenin’ upon gettin’ ashore to ’idemy
identity in mufti—said mufti bein’ bought cheap
of an old Jew in Lower George-street. After that
—more forgettin’. I must ’ave enjoyed myself,
liquor an’—an’—oh, iveil, call ’em sundries. But
I wasn’t in any state to feel ’ow deliriously ’appy
I must ha’ been.”
The sailor sighed and pondered intensely.
“And then?” I suggested.
“ Oh, then ? Then I was nabbed, sir, an’ court-
martialled for desertion, ’ideous ingratitood to
good King bled, lizzy majesty, treason and con-
spiracy, bigamy, and forgery with violence. I
was given leave of absence indefinitely, an’ ’anded
over to the tender care o’ the clink-keeper on
Cockatoo. But though they
reckoned I was to eat
the bread of shame
for twelve calender
months, I knew
that my nerves
must be stoppin’
up one by one, an’
that the poison
was world n’ from
keelson to Marcon
top, an’ that ir
six weeks my
mate Bill would
lire off the
third of a
series of blank
cartridge ex-
plosions afore
being allowed,
by the rules
of the service,
to dive for ’i
nose-wipe.
“ But, lo
and be’old, six
weeks after my
admission to this
benevolent asylum,
I found myself bet-
ter than ever I was
in my life. Three
months after said
admission I began to think Doc.
Porson ’ad made a mistake in ’is eleva-
tion. An’ then, as luck would ’ave it, I
got brownkitis an’ went up to see the sur-
geon. He giv’ me physic, an’ time, I s’pose,
’angin’ ’eavy on ’is ’ands, started in on me, tellin’
me ’ow ashamed a sound, ’ealthy young feller
like me should be to find ’isself an inmate o’ such
a place.
“ ‘’Old ’ard, sir,’ I says. ‘ I ain’t so ’ealthy as
what I look, not by no means. I was told by a
tip-top doctor that I was sufferin’ from nerve
obstruction and vital junctions, which so preyed
upon my mind that I gave ’ls Majesty the slip. ’E
said I ’ad only three months to live if I didn’t take
’is physic, an’ I made up my mind to ’ave a short
life an’ a merry one. But ’e seems to ’ave made a
bit of a mistake. ’ls 9'2 loaded Palliser fell short,
sir.’
“ The surgeon sat down’ard. The language ’e
used, sir, would 'ave got a poor A.B. into clink
for a fortnight. ’E called me seven different
kinds o’ fool, all bad kinds, for goin’ to a quack
doctor, when on board my ship there was a young
man well qualified to cure a turbid (at least I
think ’e said turbid) liver like mine. ’E told me
that the quack was a thief, and deserved ’angin’
when caught. When ’e eased up, I asks ’im
whether Dr. Porson couldn’t ’ave cured me after
all.
“’E went off again for a few minutes. ’E told
me ’e thought I’d better stay at Cockatoo when
my time was up, becos when I got out somebody
would steal my teeth. I wanted a nurse, ’e said.
I wasn’t goin’ to die till I’d bin 70 years in a
lunatic asylum. There was no such disease as
nerve-obstruction, excep’ it applied to softening of
the brain, which I ’ad, an’ that ’ls Majesty was
well rid of an ass.
“I was knocked endways. To think I’d been
in gaol three months, and had nine still to go,
made me feel bad. And the times I thought of
Doc. Porson while that nine months passed didn’t
improve my fondness for ’im. I saved it up for
’im. When I got out 1 didn’t mean to miss
lookin’ ’im up.
* * * *
“Well, the ’appy day come. I went straight
from the ferry to University-street, swingin’ my
arms as I walked through the park to get ’em in
good fettle. The doc. didn’t remember me, me
bein’ in mufti, an’ I spun ’im a yarn of ’ow bad I
felt, an’ I got'the same advice wot ’e’d give me a
year back. But this time I told ’im I ’ad £5O.
An’ is treatment expanded accordin’. I stood
up.
“ ‘ Doc,’ I says, * I’ve discovered a new cure for
nerve-obstruction. Plain livin’ an’ ’igh thinkin*.
A year ago I came to you for advice gratis as per
schedule. I got it, dirt cheap at the price. I
found this other treatment accidental-like. It
ain’t a pleasant treatment. If you only knew it,
you want about 10 years of it. But I’m goin’ to
try hoperation on you. Take your coat off and put
’em up.’ ”
“ Lame and impotent conclusion,” I said
sadly.
“ Not so, sir, you don’t know ’ow it finished.”
“Of course I do. You gave him a dirty left
which knocked him over his table; you then
crammed his stethoscope (the trumpet-thing) into
his mouth, gagged him with it, bound him with
the window cords, collected his instruments and
departed, after having jumped on his chest three
times. These instruments you pawned for £lO and
lost the ticket. It’s obvious. I would have done
it myself.”
“ I thinks not, sir. You wouldn’t ’ave done no
better than what I did. You ’ave it nice, but
wrong, ’E knew ’ow to use ’is mauleys. ’E
wiped the floor with me, an’ called in’ ’is clerk,
’oom ’e sent for a cop. Then ’e giv’ me in charge.
I got three months for assault. Think of it, sir.
The hinjustice ! Cruel ’ard, wasn’t it, sir ?
“An’ ’ere I am, gone to the dogs. A sailor
ashore is very ’elpless, an’ they only takes Dutch-
men an’ Dagos in the cargo-peddlers. Besides
—the limejuice—ugh ! I’ve kep’ out of gaol since,
but I took to the bottle. Me ’art was broke.
What do Ido for a livin’ ? Just odd jobs when 1
can get ’em. When I can’t, I peddles serge—an
old messmate o’ mine ’ooks it from the ship’s
stores. That’s ’ow it is I can sell it so cheap.
But those quacks are ’orrid frauds, sir, ain’t
they? . . .
THE GENIUS THAT NEVER DIES.
HE: “Some songs seem to live for eter.”
THE OTHER HE : “ Wonderful, isn’t it, consider-
ing how frequently they are murdered .”
“ Yessir, thankee, sir, I don’t mind if I do.”
* * * *
I wore that serge some three weeks a.fterwards
It came on to rain heavily, and—well, the medical
profession did not, I found, contain all the frauds
in this hard old world.

The Haunted Tunnel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AS Francis Xavier wove his whole life
into the first great Oriental mission, so
Fred Schlapp had blasted and picked and
gadded his immortal soul into the tunnel which
led from Snake Gully to the bottom of the water-
logged shaft on No. 309. It was a beautiful piece
of work, representing nearly two years—Sundays
included—of single-handed slavery. The hard,
solid slate required no timber, except just at the
entrance, so the top of the tunnel was neatly
arched ; and the dip of the strata exactly favored
the deep, narrow drain along the centre of the
floor. Sawn sleepers, a yard apart, carried clean,
level truck-rails, also of sawmill stuff, with a ten-
inch foot-plank between. There was no drip
from the slate, but a torrent of water ran
continuously from the old workings at the
upper end.
Fred, on completing the tunnel, had spent
a fewweeksin truckingoutand “tomming”
off many tons of dirt from the old drives
in No. 309; and during that time his
blonde hair had turned ashen grey.
But he kept his business to himself;
so that no one knew exactly the pro-
cess of thought which led him to cut
his own throat, about midway along the
tunnel which had thus hag-ridden him
to death.
When his body was found, a week
afterwards, his affairs were looked
into. The gold-yield of the dirt he
had tapped was far below tucker-
standard ; he had no money, was as
deep in debt as he could get, and had
been living solely on rice for some
months.
All this had taken place while I was
away from the diggings. When I
returned, six or seven years after Fred
had handed in his resignation, the
tunnel was as perfect as at first,
though the entrance had become draped,
and almost concealed, by bracken and
scrub. Naturally enough, the locality was
haunted.
Near the outlet stood Harris’s store, established
three years after Fred’s death, to cater for a shoal
of diggers who had rushed some fairly good
ground close by. At the time of my return,
Harris was the only completely respectable man
on the diggings—that is to say, the only man of
probity and property. Yorkey, of the “Royal,”
was as well off in a worldly sense, while Fat Hen
and Dang Li, converts of many years date, were
as rich in grace ; but Harris enjoyed both kinds
of blessing, and was thus qualified to preside over
the church which I joined on my arrival.
Months passed. A few weeks before I finally
left the diggings, Brother Harris had a visitation
of Sad health. He looked tired, and kept his bed
most of the day, though this never once prevented
his attendance at Sunday services or week-night
meetings. Indeed, his unwearied fervor put to
shame every member of the church except Fat
Hen and Dang Li. As a queer corollary to their
faith, all three believed the tunnel to be well and
truly haunt ad. When I happened to mention the
subject to them, one Sunday morning, they all
earnestly averred the truth of the popular report,
and insisted that the tunnel was no safe place at
any time, whilst to enter it after nightfall would
be simply to court death in some horrible form.
Brother Harris had never actually seen any appa-
rition, but he had heard shrieks and groans in the
tunnel, as well as the rattling of ghostly wheels
upon rails which had certainly carried no earthly
truck for more than six years. But the two
Orientals, in closer touch with the Beyond, had
not only heard the sounds repeatedly and un-
mistakably, but had seen a form too ghastly for
description in pidgin English, once at the outlet
of the tunnel, and once at the mouth of the shaft
of No. 309.
Now, I had always been a believer in the super-
natural, and here seemed an opportunity for veri-
fication or refutation of my opinion. So, toward
midnight—four or five hours after the conversa-
tion just referred to—l secretly sought the tunnel.
I had been through it several times, in daylight,
with a candle, but had then thought of nothing
beyond poor Fred’s wasted work and extinguished
hopes. Now, however, all conditions seemed con-
ducive to spectral manifestations, the night being
still and starless, and my own spiritual apprehen-
sion alert, expectant, and standing (so to speak)
on the qui rive..
After groping my way through the rugged vege-
tation which masked the entrance, I walked
silently and warily along the foot-plank, hearing
only the faint gurgle of the stream beneath, and
seeing absolutely nothing in the intense, pitchy
darkness. After going about a hundred yards, I
sat down on one of the rails, with my back against
the wall, and lit my pipe. I tried to cultivate a
weird expectancy by concentrating my mind upon
the tragic fate of the man I had once known so
intimately; but, in spite of myself, the soothing
solitude of the place hid its effect, and I resumed
the composition of a half-finished love-song.
Suddenly the heavy silence was cloven by a
shrill, despairing wail, more eerie and frightful
than anything I had calculated upon. And
scarcely had the reverberations died away when a
succession of agonising groans filled the tunnel.
Then all was still again. Whilst laboring to con-
vince myself that I had actually heard those
sounds, there fell on my ears the unmistakable
rattle of a truck—not by any means the lively
clatter and whirr of secular wheels, but the ghost
of a sound, given forth by a ghostly implement.
I felt myself becoming demoralised. The shriek
and the groans had seemed .to emanate from no-
where in particular, but I made it my business to
locate the truck, having no desire to block its
passage. My apprehension was realised; the
infernal Thing was approaching from the outlet,
and my retreat was cut off. I therefore retired
towards the shaft, pausing now and then to listen.
It was after me, right enough, and coming closer.
I have often strayed inadvertently into places
where I had no business to be, and where I wasn’t
wanted ; but the sense of intrusion and the super-
fluous feeling never smote me so convincingly as
at that moment. So, steering myself with finger-
tips touching the walls, I fled through the
Egyptian darkness, wondering what would take
place when the end of the tunnel arrested my
stampede.
IN BUNCHES SOMETIMES.
OLDSPORT : “ Why, you used to dislike children , Barney ?”
PROUD FATHER : “ True, true, but they grow on one.”
But this suspense was cut short by a new horror.
I stubbed the toe of my boot against something
which sounded like a coffin ; and the ensuing fall
was checked by my face and hands coming in con-
tact with some rounded object, smooth, cold, and
clammy. One moment of hasty and desperate
groping showed the tunnel to be barricaded with
coffins and corpses. But the gruesome vehicle
was at my heels in the black solitude—probably
bringing in another supply—and without hesi-
tation I resolved to scale or force the barricade of
inoffensive deaders rather than face an unhal-
lowed Energy capable of translating itself into
foot-pounds. There was a space between the top
of the barricade and the arch of the roof ; and, by
stepping on a slightly yielding but inelastic
object, I wriggled into this aperture. I remember
tearing my Sunday clothes on the rough slate
above ; and I also remember that the smell of the
collection (nothing is farther from my mind than
flippancy) reminded me of dried ling, multiplied
by ancient cheese, and reinforced by an effluvium
of smoked bacon. However, my feet had scarcely
cleared the face of the barricade when my head
bumped against the end of a coffin, blocking the
already insufficient passage.
Nearer and nearer rumbled
the phantom truck, till I heard
it hit one of the coffins. Then
a match was struck; and,
glancing past my own feet, I
saw Brother Harris standing
behind a truck-load of groceries
in bulk. The match was hastily
blown out after its first flash,
but that glint of light showed
me the cases of goods, mats
of sugar, sides of bacon, &c.,
which my own disturbed im-
agination had taken as mortu-
ary properties.
In the still, intense dark-
ness I heard Brother Harris
unload his truck, and stack its
cargo against the barricade.
Then he uttered a long, quiver-
ing shriek in the Wesleyan
language, followed by a few
unearthly groans, and returned
down the tunnel with his
empty carriage. I extricated myself and
followed the sound. The rails ended at the
outlet ; here he stopped the truck and went
out. 1 furtively followed, but had to retreat as
he re-entered, carrying something. This was
repeated three or four times before I got clear of
the tunnel. Then, lying among the ferns, I heard
him talking in suppressed tones to his wife, who
had just arrived with something from the store.
Whatever it was, he took it to the truck ; then
the two figures, scarcely discernible in the mid-
night gloom, disappeared together. In a few
minutes they returned, loaded to their capacity.
Harris carried the two burdens in succession to
the truck, meanwhile grumbling at his wife for
her superstitious fear of the tunnel. Presently
the awful wail of a lost soul, followed by a few
appalling groans, indicated that the vehicle was
again under way, whereupon the woman raced
homeward for dear life, whilst I rose from ambush
and went my way.
A heavy fall of rain during the forenoon had
partly flooded the most direct route to the hut,
so I made a detour which took me past the deserted
shaft on No. 309. Approaching this old familiar
spot, I could have sworn to hearing the faint creak
of a windlass, though the winding-barrel, with its
handles, had been taken out of the uprights many
years before. I had just been fooled by one decep-
tion ; but this manifestation seemed to be worth
inquiring into—bearing in mind that some basis of
truth generally underlies a fraud.
As my clothes were dark-colored, I avoided all
pipeclay background ; and, taking advantage of
the wild growth of ferns and shrubs, made my
way to within twelve feet of the shaft. The land-
ing-brace was about five feet high, and there,
faintly but definitely silhouetted against the sky,
appeared a windlass-barrel set in the old slots, and
the figure of a ghost on its hands and knees. Just
then, a barely audible wail from the bowels of the
earth signified that Brother Harris was still on the
job. Presently the kneeling apparition spoke
down the shaft in a suppressed tone.
“ Dang Li ! Muek-a-hi-lo ? Sen-ling-yan lot-
fli-tum-tum-sling ? ”
More faintly came the reply from below.
“ Tum-tum-sling-ven-dam-toe. Limp-ho-yong!”
The kneeling spook “ ho-yanged” with alacrity,
and got to work at the windlass. In a couple of
minutes it landed a load, and sent down the rope
again. Then it carried the consignment from the
brace, placed the lot within arm’s-length of my
lair, and resumed its post. While the next load
was coming up, I stealthily explored my own
vicinity, and found about a ton of merchandise,
similar in character to that which Brother Harris
was stacking in the tunnel.
After a few more loads had been landed, Fat
Hen hoisted his fellow-convert to the surface. In
another minute they had restored the desolate

aspect of the landing-brace by removing the
windlass-barrel, rope and all ; this done, they
loaded their bamboos and ambled homeward
through the darkness. Looking over the salvage
that remained, I concluded that it would take at
least two hours to shift the lot.
A week later, Brother Harris went to Mel-
bourne and filed his schedule. The little trouble
had been so judiciously arranged in the first place
that it was put through speedily and safely ; but
by the time his certificate was issued the good
man found his insolvency to be more genuine than
he had counted upon. In fact, he had to make a
fresh start on a hawker’s license, while the dis-
creet Asiatics bought his premises for a mere
trifle, and kept the business going. Such is life.
TOM COLLINS.
A Christmas Dream.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HIED me to my chamber,
And on my Christmas bed
I flung myself with gladness
To rest my weary head.
But scarce had Somnus round me
His opiate arms entwined,
When shadows of the future
There came into my mind.
A vision of Australia—
Australia far away
Within the coming ages,
And it was Christmas Day.
It reeked of curious odors
That rose up from the flare
Of altars served by heathens,
With cow-grease in their hair.
A dusky concourse grovelled
With gestures weird and wild,
Before a polished idol
Of features bland and mild.
He gazed from eyes of glassware
Across the plains of space;
Above the piebald hurry
That thronged the market-place,
As though he were aweary
Of all their mummery,
And breathing objurgations
On each black devotee.
Across the dusty roadway,
In close propinquity,
A yellow crowd gyrated
And bellowed eerily.
Above, their ensign floated —
Chrysanthemum and fan ;
And always loud they shouted,
“ Banzai! for Young Japan ! ”
And in another roadway,
I found another crowd
Of yellow, grinning people,
Vociferating loud.
A strange crew they, and motley,
And pre-Darwinian—
Each keen, fantastic-visaged,
Long-pigtailed Chinaman.
And ever as they shouted
The opium fumes rose high ;
Like whirlwinds they ascended
Unto the turquoise sky.
I wandered thro’ the City,
Amid the shindy loud,
By wharf and street and roadway.
And viewed the jabbering crowd.
Some vended smirking idols
Amid the din and blare.
They sat within the market
With cow-grease in their hair.
And some sold elephantine
Figures from Mandalay,
And some blew hollow reeds, or
Banged castanets all day.
And some danced weird, wild dances,
With opium frenzy fraught ;
And some like demons bellowed
Beside a Juggernaut.
It stood within a square there.
With flags and paint all decked.
With energy and prayer there
The peaceful air was wrecked
By that dark-visaged concourse,
Whose voices loud did roll,
Yelling for ever something
That seemed like “ Hurri-bol ! ”
I thought I was the only
White man about the place ;
The last, and sad, and lonely
Survivor of my race.
Yet none there seemed to notice
I was not of their kin,
Amidst the rush and hustle
Of multi-nationed din.
I wandered thro’ the markets,
And thro’ each grand arcade,
Yet still no heathen noticed,
Nor hindered me, nor stayed.
But as I slow meandered
Each offered me some ware ;
With avaricious leering,
And cow-grease in his hair.
I woke me from the horror ;
I woke and it was morn ;
Shook off my dismal vision
And laughed it unto scorn.
But there are ghostly moments
When cometh unto me
The thought that even dreams are
Not quite illusory.
That for this race of triflers
Who waste their chances fair,
A nigger Fate is waiting—
With cow-grease in its hair !

No Man but a Specialist should treat
a Genito-Urinary Disease.
We excel in this Speciality.
Get Treated In your own Homes.
We give you evidence daily and the greatest of proofs
that we excel as Men’s Specialists, and can you any
longer doubt our ability or sincerity to cure you?
If you have the slightest doubt in your mind we will
further prove the efficacy of our treatment.
Patients who take our home treatment receive the same
expert attention as if we saw them in person. When we
receive our Question Chart filled out correctly, our
Specialists are able to diagnose your case as accurately as
if you were personally present. Our Diagnosis
Charts are seriously studied by our Specialists, and care-
ful records made of each so that we understand your case
as well as if you had given us a personal call.
Our Enormous Medical Practice.
We are treating thousands of cases annually, and is it
Hot reasonable to suppose that we understand such cases
better than those who are treating only a few hundred ?
Practice makes perfect. Order your treatment at
once, and let us add your name to our long list of cures.
If the slightest doubt exists in your mind that our
treatment will not cure you, it is a duty you owe to your-
self to write to some of the references we continuously
publish, and send an addressed envelope for reply. Ask
any of those who have given testimonies if we can benefit
you. We court the closest investigation. Our Parcel
Post System has saved thousands of men who would now
be in their graves had we not reached and treated them
by this most excellent of mail systems.
THE FREEMAN & WALLACE INSTITUTE
Of PHYSICIANS, SURGEONS, and SPECIALISTS.
Young 1 Middle-aged, and Old Men, what are your troubles? Have you a thorough
understanding of the value of your health, or what it means to be without it ? We can tell you
that it is the best blessing a man can receive. Therefore, do not lose it completely 1 f correct
Medical treatment will cure your troubles. Remember, patients treated and cured by us run
into thousands. We have thousands at present upon our books treated by our 1 arcel 1 ost
System. We receive grateful letters daily.
These people have read our advertisements, and been recommended by cured friends. One
Thing is Certain— we treat and cure them whatever may be the cause of consultation.
As we diagnose a disease, pronouncing a man curable, studying the cause, duration, and
phenomena of diseased condition, we effect a cure, provided the patient obediently takes our
remedies and obeys the physical laws and dietary instructions we enforce.
Our percentage of cures is Ninety-five per cent. We always treat our patients cour-
teously study them effectually, prescribe for them honestly We do not fail to win their good
opinions. Nearly half our business results from recommendations from men saved by us from
premature decay and early ruin.
As stated in this advertisement we make a specialty in Diseases of Men. We allude to
that class of disorder afflicting and attacking what is known physiologically as the Genito-
urinary tract, embracing the most important Organs of Man, Bladder and Kidneys. A com-
plete study of this tract alone demands all a doctor’s time.
Perfection in the treatment of disease is as necessary as in the building of a tabernacle or
the painting of a picture. A concentrative study is absolutely necessary if a doctor desires to
excel in the treatment of one particular form of disease.
We do not treat all diseases, but we cure all we treat; we back this statement by our testi-
monies. Here is one proving we cure men to stay cured :
“ Messrs. Freeman and Wallace, —
I have been under your treatment for the cure of a General Weakened condition allied to
Debility. For years I have not been strong. After being under your treatment I am cured of

Hero is a testimony from a man cured beyond all doubt, once a physical wreck, now strong
and sturdy: Reader, What Ails You ?
Whilst in town for the Christmas Season call on us. We have Four Qualified Medical
Specialists in attendance, either of whom you may consult. You may have tried doctors and
been treated wrongly. Remember, no one but a Specialist should treat certain forms of Men’s
Diseases. We welcome cases treated v/nsuccessfully and tampered with by Medical men. Pamphlets
of testimonies will be mailed free.
For friendly chats with the Physician-in-Chief, Dr. Richard Wallace, no charge is
made. Remember, the Australasian Medical Practitioners’ Lists prove he is registered by the
Medical Boards of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, England and America.
Here are some figures as to the distribution of his Medical Work, “Clinical Expe-
riences,” 670 pages, 31 chapters, 150 Medical plates, which we send out free to any addresss.
Since the year 1901 two editions of 50,000 have been distributed in Australia. At present
another edition of 25,000 volumes is in the Press. If you want this book drop us a post-card
with your address written plainly, you will get it by return mail. Also if there is any trouble
upon which you require to be enlightened, we will only be too glad to send you information.
We do this in the interests of humanity.
Women’s Diseases.
The department for the treatment of
women at the Institute is under the super-
vision of Dr. Elizabeth White, a famous
ladv doctor and expert diagnostician, who is registered by the Medical Boards of
New South Wales, Victoria, New Zealand, and America. Dr. White is possessed
of valuable experience gained at the most famous American and Indian colleges,
and has travelled extensively in India, China, Japan, Australia, and America.
Anv suffering woman can consult her at her elegant rooms, 225 Ehzabeth-street,
Sydney, or by correspondence. Dr. White has studied with some of the leading
wea j tneSseg f rom w hich women suffer which are far better
understood bv a lady physician than by a man, who cannot personally experience
them For this reason a woman can confidently expect fuller information and
perhaps a keener diagnosis of her condition from the hands of a doctor of her sex.
Sufferers are invited to call, as all consultations are free.

THE
COLONIAL MUTUAL LIFE ASSURANCE
SOCIETY, LIMITED.
Principal Offices - - 419 & 421 Collins Street, Melbourne.
Actuarial Investigation Results:
The Sixth Actuarial Investigation into the affairs of the Society (for the 5 years ended 31st December,
1904) has recently been completed, and the Directors have announced that there was a surplus of
£261,541.
The Directors decided to set aside £50,000 to increase the Investment Fluctuation Fund, leaving
£211,541 for allotment and distribution.
This highly satisfactory result has been achieved notwithstanding the fact that the new Om Table was
employed in the calculation of the expected mortality under the Society’s Policies, requiring large
reserves to be made, and that the rate of interest assumed was only per cent.
Payments Made Under Policies:
During the 5 years THE SOCIETY HAS PAID AWAY OVER ONE MILLION STERLING in
CLAIMS arising by death or survivance to the date stipulated.
Increase of Funds:
In spite of the large payments referred to above, THE FUNDS HAVE INCREASED by over
£534,000, and now amount to THREE MILLIONS STERLING.
Prog'ress of Business:
The Society’s business has been steadily progressive throughout the period, the number of Policies
having been increased by over 3000 and the Annual Income by over £20,000, notwithstanding the
depletion caused by death and withdrawals.
Annual Income:
THE PRESENT ANNUAL INCOME OF THE SOCIETY EXCEEDS £450,000.
Policy of the Society in the Condud of
its Business:
At the recent meeting held in Melbourne, the Chairman of Directors, who presided, pithily described
the policy of the Society in the. conduct of its business : “ Sound Business at Payable Kates,
combined with Investments at the best rate of Interest compatible with safety.

and women through all ages. No picture having for its central
figure the human form could approach the ideal in loveliness without
its being crowned with a luxuriant head of hair. It has been the
theme of bards and the song of poets. So great was my admiration
for a beautiful head of hair that twenty years ago I determined to
give my whole life to its study. During all that time its preservation
and growth have had my most assiduous attention. Twenty years of
study of “ The Hair and its Treatment” have caused my services to
be sought after by people living in nearly every part of the world,
and my preparations are now being used by doctors and the elite of
society everywhere.
Ranigeview, 60 Mary-street, Kew.
I have much pleasure in testifying to your very successful treat-
mentofmy daughter’s hair. I began to despair of her getting rid of
pl l ® spots which she had for many years. I spent over £lOO on
it before I placed her under your treatment. Thanking you for the
kind interest you have taken in her case, MRS. SIMPSON.
PARASENE.
MR. E. HOLLAND.
Dear Sir, —My daughter, aged 12, lost her hair and eyelashes
some years ago. We had her under the treatment of two doctors for
over two years, and their treatment was wholly ineffective. I com-
municated with you, and you wrote telling me it was a parasitical
disease that was the cause of the trouble. We carried out your
instructions and used your preparations, and the result has been most
satisfactory. Her hair and eyelashes have grown splendidly. lam
pleased to write you this for your own sake, and thankful for my
little girl s sake, too.—Yours very truly, W. J. JACKA.

PARASENE.
Kenmore West, via Nanango, Q.
Dear Sir, —I am writing these few lines as a testimonial for your
Parasene, and also to show you my appreciation of your successful
treatment for falling hair. I had tried several other remedies for
falling hair, but they had failed to make it grow ; but, after using a
few bottles of Parasene, it commenced to grow from round the edges
of the bald patch. I have recommended it to a gentleman over here
by the name of Baker, who promised to try it. His hair was coming
out in very much the same way as mine was. I will try to encourage
and recommend your treatment to all I possibly can. Hoping you will
have much success in your business,—l remain', yours thankfully,
E. N. ROBERTS.
MR. E. HOLLAND.
Chicago, U.S.A.
Dear Sir, —Your treatment of my own hair was so successful that
I have recommended it to Mr. Davies, of the Bank of Nova Scotia,
Chicago, 111., U.S.A. Kindly send him two bottles of Baldene. —
Yours faithfully, A. W. KIRKWOOD.

Dear Sir, —I am sending you a postal note for 6s. for another
bottle of your Parasene for my son’s head. The hair came off in
patches, and I have tried many cures without avail ; but the bottle I
got from you has taken effect, and already the hair is beginning to
grow.—l remain, yours faithfully, J. H. N.

Christmas
New Year
Presents.
HE announcement by Mr. Coghlan
that tlie population of the Common-
wealth has increased, in the last two
years, by nearly 92,000—about 40,000 a year
gave us no surprise. We had surmised,
from the statistics of our own business for
the time named, that in Queensland and
New South Wales, at all events, where our
clientele is mainly situated, there was a rapid
and substantial increase proceeding either in
men or in money, probably in both. Basing
our calculations for the requirements of the
Christmas and New Year Season, in the way
of Gifts, on this very inspiriting belief, we
placed our orders in the World’s Great
Centres of Arts and Crafts on an un-
precedently lavish scale.
We are thereby enabled to offer to our
friends on this occasion the Largest, Most
Varied, Most Valuable, and—for then-
values—the Lowest Priced Collection in
Australia of Articles suitable for Christmas
and New Year Presents.
We append a list of a few of these, with
their prices.

THE NOX-ALL
t
V»SF

m
ARMED WITH A “ NOX-ALL."
TIHE accompanying' illustrations give a very good idea of the New Distributor,
which consists of a Brass Barrel with Steel Hoe attached. It holds enough
pollard for over 1000 baits, the size of which are automatically regulated
by the amount of pressure applied to the Plunger Handle. The Machine
can be easily carried on foot, or horseback, as shown in one picture, without any
inconvenience. This makes it possible when visiting outlying places for the inspec-
tion of fences or stock, etc., to lay baits with good results, as such places are seldom
reached by the Poison Carts.
Those having to deal with the Babbit Pest will at once see its many good
points and adaptability to all classes of work.
A person using it can cross and re-cross streams, get over fences, and other
obstacles that would otherwise cause many detours.
In the midst of crops where rabbits are often found in small colonies, on steep
banks, and amongst rocks, and fallen timber, etc., the machine is invaluable,
and a higher all-round percentage of baits can be counted upon taking effect.
For a person who can only spare an occasional hour or so baiting, or who wishes
to combine it with some other work the IN OX-ALL is always ready at hand, no
time being wasted in getting a machine ready, or in catching horses, etc.
The Machine is invaluable in laying baits round warrens, and within easy
reach of young rabbits, which are never far, from their burrows. This is a great
advantage, as the rabbits are destroyed before they are old enough to breed or
to do much damage to the grass.
The special advantages of the Machine are its portability, simplicity, and the
ease and rapidity with which thorough work is done, a boy being capable of using it.
The machine has no intricate parts to get out of order, and duplicates cost but
a few pence.
A NOX-ALL should form part of the kit of every poison cart, as there are
many places not accessible to the cart that could be done with ease with the
NOX-ALL. thereby making a thorough job of the baiting.
The following are a few extracts from many letters received :
Argyle, Wagga Wagga, N.S.W., 4th November, 1905.
Dear Sir, —I enclose cheque £1 10s. and wish you to forward another of your “ Nox-All ”
Pollard Distributors. lam pleased to say I find tile “ Nox-Ai.l” excellent for treating' burrows
where young rabbits exist, and if of any value to you I can testify to its value as an exterminator
of the pest.—Yours faithfully, 0. D. GIBBS.
Bunarba North, Moree, 27th October, 1905.
Dear Sir,—l enclose 30s. cheque and Od. ex. for “ Kox-Atn ” received, and as I find it so
useful I wish you would send me one more—c/o. Wright, Heaton and Co., Moree. —Yours
faithfully, CHARLES G. WESTON.
GobOlion, Wellington, October 29th, 1905.
Dear Sir, —The Poison Distributor arrived, and I am writing to ask you
to send another to me to Ellengerah, Trangie, and to send account for the
two to me here, and send letter with instructions addressed to the Manager,
Ellengerah, Trangie. Please send it by return post, and I feel sure that all
the neighbors round here will soon get them, as I call them a very handy
machine. —I am, yours faithfully, W. A. GARDINER.

For coughs and colds.
“ A friend in need is a friend in-
deed.” Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral is just
Such a friend. Never bo without it.
It will prove a good friend when you
havo a fresh cold, bringing immedi-
ate relief. You will find it equally
true in old colds, bronchitis, whoop-
ing-cough, asthma.
If you will use
filler's
'Cherry 9eetoral
for an irritable throat or weak lungs,
you will find it “the host friend in
the world.” It acts as a strong tonic,
clearing up the throat, giving tone
to the relaxed tissues, and greatly
strengthening the lungs.
There are many substitutes and
imitations. Beware of them and of
so-called “ Genuine Cherry Pectoral.”
Be sure you get AYER’S Cherry

Bolls, Pimples, Rashes-all of the

Sinkinson’s strong words in its praise,

K
it I suffered for years from indigestion,
and a sort of heat lumps over my body.
The medicines recommended to me did no
good and I only wasted my money on them.
Being strongly advised to try
AYER’S
Sarsaparilla
I did so, and was agreeably surprised, as it
did for me all that is claimed for it. After
taking several bottles I was cured entirely
of my complaints. This is some years ago,
but I have continued to take two or three bottles every year, as Ayer s Sar-
saparilla builds me up and enables me to carry on my duties.”
J. Sinkinson, Unley, S. A,
Keep your blood in good condition, keep your digestion
strong, and keep your nervous system vigorous. Then
you will not suffer from the weakening effects of hot
weather. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla was made for just these
purposes. It cools the blood, tones up the digestive appa-
ratus, puts force into the nervous system. And it fortifies
against hot weather, cold weather, or changeable weather.
It gives strength to ward off disease.
Don’t be deceived by trying some other Sarsapa-
rilla. Don’t experiment with imitations. Hold fast
to the tried and tested Sarsaparilla— AYEß’S. A
tonic for ail seasons of the year.
Prepared by DB. J. O. AYER & CO., Lowell, Mass., TJ. S. A.
Ayer’s Pills are a purely vegetable laxative for the whole family.
