Huneker’s Essays
AFTER Lowell's death America
could boast of only one critic of
importance—Henry James, and
long ago he gave up formal criticism
for fiction. How there are two critics in
America whose work has interest beyond
its home—Paul E. More, author of the
Shelburne Essays, who displays the cul-
ture and grace of the best English tradi-
tion, and James Huneker, who follows
Henry James as an explorer in foreign
literature, and devotes himself with
special zest to the works of those artists
who are regarded as morbid, decadent or
mad. Of Austro-Hungarian descent on
one side and Irish on the other, James
Huneker was brought up in America and
Paris, well trained in music, and educated
for the Church, but drifted into jour-
nalism, and is now art critic for the Hew
York Sun. He has published two
volumes of short stories, many of which
are unusual and imaginative in theme,
but unsatisfactory in treatment; he may
be no more than a dilettante in the other
arts he has practised, but his origin and
his training have admirably fitted him
for criticism in the particular field which
he seems to have chosen. In range he is
comparable with Arthur Symons. His
temperament is analytical and indivi-
dualistic ; his outlook is forward, not back-
ward ; and he is most attracted by the
moderns who are engaged in breaking up
the old formulas or paving the way to a
new world of ideas. Hence his Iconoclasts:
a Booh of Dramatists contains sym-
pathetic criticism of the works of Ibsen,
Hauptmann, Sudermann, Maeterlinck,
and Shaw; and his latest volume, Egoists:
a Booh of Supermen (per Sydney Book
Club) is equally worth reading for its
stimulating studies of Baudelaire, Flau-
bert, Anatole France, Barres, Max Stirner
and others.
Huneker seems to have a fad for single
word titles Melomaniacs, Overtones,
Visionaries, etc., just as the dramatist
Bernstein superstitiously avoids a title
with more than six letters. Heither
Egoists nor Supermen is an illuminating
description of such diverse characters as
the sentimentalist Stendhal and the
pessimist Huysmans, William Blake,
Walter Pater, and the others mentioned.
Helvfitius plausibly referred all human
actions to self-interest. Egoism is so
universal a characteristic that it is value-
less as a label, except in the case of
writers, entirely devoted to the cult—
Max Stirner and Barrfes for example.
\!/
Barr&s called hisownbooksmetaphysical
fiction, the adventures of a contemplative
young man’s mind. To study and note
the fleeting shapes of his soul was the
one thing he thought worth doing in a
life of mediocrity. He would make of
himself a mirror reflecting the changes of
his environment, and as Amiel believed
that every landscape is a state of
soul, so he avowed that his soul
was full of landscapes wherein all
might enter and find themselves. He
was as frank about his soul as Walt
Whitman was about his body, and more
interesting. Huneker describes his first
book as a Vita Nuova of egoism, and says
that “in his fugue-like flights down the
corridor of his metaphysics he never
neglects to drop some poetic rose, some
precious pearl of sentiment.” Max
Stirner, who, as the French would say,
imitated Hietzsche in advance, is the
almost forgotten prophet of egoism, whose
book, The Ego and his Own has been
translated into English. His real name
was Schmidt, and it is stated that his
wife, objecting to his egotism, left him,
came out to Australia, and became a
washerwoman. This valiant enemy of
the State, who would make a clean sweep
of civilisation, was a timid man, quiet
and unassuming in manners. And
Hietzsche, delicate from youth, “ living in
an inferno, mental and physical,” was a
poetical advocate of the gospel of strength,
of the Dionysian element in art and life,
and of egoism raised to its highest power.
Henry JBeyle-Stendhal, of whose numerous
works only Rouge et Noir survives, was
a commonplace, ugly little man; yet
he possessed an exquisite sensibility,
was always in love and showed incom-
parable knowledge of the human heart.
These writers were supermen only in
their intellectual life.
Huysmans began as an egoist record-
ing physical emotions—“ the prose singer
of neurasthenia, a Schopenhauer of the
cookshops,” who over ugliness would be-
come almost lyric.
He was a specialist, one who had ransacked
libraries for 'curious details, despoiled per-
fumers’ catalogues for their odorous vocables,
pored over technical dictionaries for odd-
colored words, and studied cook books for
savory terms. His gamut of sensations
began at the violet ray. He was a peverse
aristocrat who descended to the gutter, there
to analyse the various stratifications of filth ;
when he returned to his ivory cell he had
discovered not humanity, but an anodyne,
the love of God. Thenceforth he was inter-
ested in one thing—the saving of the soul of
Joris-Karl Huysmans.
Huneker’s studies of Baudelaire and
Flaubert are based on an intimate know-
ledge of their work, and remove a number
of misconceptions due mainly to the cur-
rency of Maxime du Camp’s reckless gossip.
His brief glimpses of two mystics—Ernest
Hello and Francis Poictevin—induce
further inquiry. He writes freshly about
Anatole France, in whom he finds some-
thing of Petronius, and not a little of
Saint Francis. In a sentence he ex-
presses his opinion of the art of Anatole,
a sentence which serves as an illustration
of his habit of accumulating epithets :
An art ironical, easy, fugitive, divinely
untrammelled, divinely artificial, which like
a pure flame blazes forth in an unclouded
heaven. ... la gaya scienza, light feet, wit,
fire, grace, the dance of the stars, the
tremor of southern light, the smooth sea—
these Nietzschean phrases might serve as an
epigraph for the work of that apostle of
innocence and experience, Anatole France.
The essays assume a good deal of know-
ledge on the part of the reader; the
style is uneasy and at times irritating
with its mannerisms, but the criticism is
independent and suggestive, and helps
to an understanding of some writers who
are worth bothering about.
De Maupassant
All short story writers should respect the
name of Guy de Maupassant. America can
find no greater praise to bestow upon her
greatest living exponent of the art of the
short story, 0. Henry, than favorable com-
parison with the great French master, the
man whose fame after tfie publication of one
story immediately eclipsed that of Zola and
Daudet, who became at a single bound the
most prominent writer of his age. The
story in question is the short, rather cynical,
anecdote relating to a petty incident in the
Franco-Prussia war, called ( ‘ Boule de
Suif.” It, however, took one year in the
writing, which fact should be pregnant wioh
meaning to nearly all writers of the present
day.
The son of a woman in whom that strange,
yet far from uncommon, combination of
genius and madness freely mingled, Mau-
passant seemed fated from birth, predestined
to a life of fame and melancholy, a death of
terror.
To the novelist Flaubert he owed his first
lessons in the art of which he eventually
became the world’s acknowledged master.
v;-“jYou have intelligence,” said Flaubert to
his pupil, after glancing at some work of his,
“ only no originality.”
But how to attain that for which all
writers are continually striving ? Flaubert’s
formula was a hard one :
Go out, he said, “to the first cab-rank
and study the first horse ; then write a brief
description and show, by one word if possi-
ble, in what that cab-horse differs from all
other horses in Paris.”
By one word if possible ! That was the
goal of . Flaubert, which, after studying
under him for seven years, Maupassant
triumphantly reached.
In 1887—Maupassant was then 37 years of
age ; healthy, rich, renowned—the sword,
which since infancy had been suspended
over his head, fell. One evening the door
of his study opened, a figure entered, sat
down beside him, and dictated a story. The
story finished, Maupassant, pen in hand
looked up ; but the figure had vanished.
Then he realised it had never been, was bu
the wraith of a diseased imagination.
From that moment he was a haunted man
His brother, Henri de Maupassant, six years
younger, married as a youth, living the quiet
regular life of a gentleman farmer, had re-
cently gone mad ; what hope was there, then,
for the elder brother, living at best in a
world created by his own fancy, peopled with
the denizens of a teeming brain. • Gqy de
Maupassant fled to his yacht and sailed away
in search of peace. Did he find it 1 The
question is answered in “ Sur 1’ eau,” the
gloomiest yet most beautiful book of travels
ever written.
Then one witnesses as brave a fight against
outrageous fortune as was ever made by
mortal man. In the very furnace of suffer-
ing his whole character became purged. The
bitterness of younger days is gone, and over
his writings there now breathes an infinite
love, an almighty compassion. What in
Tolstoi or Balzac can compare with ‘ ‘ The
Field of Olives ?”.... Returning one night
from the theatre, he found all the furniture
of his house had become alive ; chairs
trotted out past him into the garden ; sofas
waddled, like alligators, on tiny legs ; even
the grand piano hopped in concert with its
fellows ; moreover, as a crown of thorns to
a cross of agony, he, at that period, fell, for
the first time, in love.
The feelings of the lady, a brilliant wordly
woman, history has been unable to gauge.
If she feared, and treated such a lover with
coldness, who can blame her ? It is known,
however, that one evening after leaving her
louse in some bitterness, his mind gave
way completely, and he was moved to Passy,
where, on July 6, 1893, he died.
ALDRIDGE EVELYN.
Two new novels with a Maoriland setting
have arrived: one, The Tragedy of a Flirtation,
by Harry B. Yogel (Greening); the other,
Philip Loveluck, by Charles Owen (Bell).
Yogel has four or five books to his credit,
and shows a practised hand in the manage-
ment of his story up to a certain point.
His heroine, beautiful and all the rest of it,
refuses all offers, and explains to her aunt:
I don’t want to marry a man I don’t like—at
least not yet. .. . Sooner or later I’ll have to go
to the stud. .. . That’s what I’m wanted for.
If I must, I must. Only I want to postpone it.
She goes to Maoriland instead, and flirts with a
settler who eventually forces her into marry-
ing him. She likes him but hates the life,
and on discovering that he has had a Maori
mistress, she returns to London. Then the
story goes to pieces, and ends in crude melo-
drama. Philip Loveluck is not a bad love
and murder story with an unexpected end-
ing. It also boasts an irregular Maori lady
and a sacrificed white wife, but is stronger
and more closely knit than Yogel’s yarn.
Fingerposts scattered here and there, such
as ‘ 4 Brown eyes that prophesied approaching
tragedy,” “She did not know that a great
shadow was going to fall between Philip and
herself,” are signs of the amateur which will
disappear ; but Charles Owen does not seem
to have any sense of humor, and is, there-
fore, not a very promising proposition as a
novelist.
A. R. Goring-Thomas, formerly of Sydney,
certainly has humor, though not much else.
Mfs. Gramercy-Park (John Lane) is a smart,
satirical account of a wealthy American
breaking into English society. Her first
experience was of a Bohemian gathering at
Mrs.s de Courcy Brown’s, where one of the
literary ladies, who is clairvoyant, relates a
talk she had had with Robert Browning, just
as she had come in from her bath :
“ Did you think to ask him about the Chester-
top book?” her husband asked. “Yes. I was
frightened at the effect of my question. Robert
shook in ether, like a bad cinematographic pic-
ture. I really think that Robert was about to
swear. His agitation was so intense that it caused
him to pass away without replying.”
There is a solid relief character from New
England, who comes over as factotum for
Mrs. Gramercy-Park, is tenderly senti-
mental, and bags a duke; while all the
amusing efforts of the brazen hyphenated
person end in failure. The book shows a
feminine acquaintance with women’s toilets,
and the worst of feminine characteristics in
a spiteful attack on another ex-Sydney
writer.
In The Bed Bose of a Summer (Sydney
Book Club) Louise Mack makes use of her
experiences in Italy. That Jtaly of which
she dreamed in an old Bulletin poem :
Oh, Italy, dream Italy !
Are you so fair ?
proves to be even fairer than the dream. She
writes now as might a native of the country,
in English mixed with Italian and scraps of
other languages. Her characters drink their
caffe latte on the terrazzo, eat risottos with
little minced-up fegatini and adorable things
fried in batter in the fritto misto, and when
they are not simpatica or simpaticissima,
they are tedesca. But the polyglot chatter
is very bright and amusing, and the simple
love story is well told.
Splinters on the WaU” and other Verses ,
by “ Narranghi Boori,” alias J. S. Ryan
(published by W. Mahony, Is.), is a col-
lection of humorous jingles written for Aus-
tralian newspapers, which many readers will
be glad to have in a cover designed by
Weston. They are mostly the rollicking
rhymes of one who declines to take life
seriously, and declares that:
My manifest virtues are fewer than yours.
And my life is a blanky sight bluer than yours ;
I’ll take an oath strong
.That both lives are wrong,
But mine has a sweeter allure than yours.
Some of the verses are “suitable for reci-
tation,” others would fit music-hall tunes,
and all are amusing.
Sosh and Anti-osh
The Syduey Worker reprints a series o:
explanatory articles on Australian Socialism
under the title of The Rising Tide , by Dr
H. I. Jensen. After defining Socialism i
general terms and stating that the name
also applied to the movement towards tha
objective, Jensen gives a simple explanatio
of the doctrine of evolution, the effect o
environment, the evils of the present systei
and the way out. He describes the Labo
party as the party of Evolutionary Socialist
as distinguished from the Revolutionar
Socialists, whose scheme “has no scientifi
basis, is destructive to all the noblest in
stincts of man, and is foredoomed to failure.
. . . The case for Evolutionary Socialism i
stated clearly, moderately, yet forcibly, anc
can be read with advantage by anyone.
A. St. Ledger, a Senator for Queensland
publishes a more elaborate volume, attack
ing the Labor party. It is called Austrcdian
Socialism : An Historical Sketch of its Origin
and Developments (MacMillan), and endeavors
to prove that Socialism received its origina'
impulse in Australia from William Lane
that the ideals of Bellamy, Marx and other
European Socialists are the ideal's or ob-
jective of the Australian Labor Party, anc
that the main work of the Labor Party has
been to profess this Socialistic gospel on the
platform and suppress it in Parliament—“in
other words, that its Parliamentary, as dis-
tinguished from its platform and special
press, campaigns, have been one long decep-
tion of the public.” In another word-
fudge ! The charge of deception is absurd,
as his own book shows. The most vision-
ary Socialist when in Parliament must
confine himself to immediate practical
proposals. The ideals of all Socialists
are much the same; their definitions
vary in detail. The influence of Lane,
considerable enough in reality, has been
greatly exaggerated. St. Ledger regards the
birth of Australian Socialism as an unpre-
cedented event, a weird phenomenon in a
new country, during a period of progress and
comparative prosperity. “It fell like a bolt
from the blue, like a comet unheralded.”
Instead, it was a natural growth which
went on quietly until the abolition of
plural voting broke down the political bar-
rier and suddenly let in the crowd with a
rush. As an attack upon the Labor
party, St. Ledger’s book is futile ; but it has
some value as a contribution to the history
of Australian Socialism, and the appendices
are useful for reference.
Another attack upon the Labor Party
comes in the form of a play suggested
by The Englishman's Home. The author
remains in obscurity, and w r e are afraid
Reaping the Whirlvnnd (Websdale, Shoo-
smith, Ltd.) will not bring him into the
blaze of the footlights. The action begins
in “the near East,” which geographically
ought to be Norfolk Island, but is ap-
parently intended for Japan. A British-
born Russian subject has escaped from
prison on Saghalien and is captured by the
Japs. He is offered freedom and wages on
condition that he goes to “Austral Asia ” to
stir up strife in the Labor Party, and throw
obstacles in the way of defence. A whole
act is occupied by a public meeting at which
this Jap emissary, turned Labor agitator,
declaims against conscription and advocates
a universal strike. The author is not with-
out abilitybut he has more flatulent
patriotism than dramatic sense. He makes
sure, however, by a liberal use of under-
lines, that the actor shall not miss the
proper emphasis, and he wisely directs that
the curtain should be “quick.”

A GREAT SUFFERER
Tried Many Medicines.
“ There is no question of greater importance to a
community than health,’’ said Mr. George Alfred
Willis, of No. 7 Bourke Street, Zetland, when re-
cently engaged in conversation with a reporter,
“ for when that is lost matters remain at a stand-
still pending its recovery. That was my experi-
ence, at all events.” he continued, ‘‘for when I
was taken ill some time back, I was not able to
get along at all.”
“Was your work of a laborious nature, Mr.
Willis?”
“ Carpentering—not the easiest job on earth,
you know ; but if it had been quill driving it would
have been all the same to me, as I had no energy
whatever. As a matter of fact, I was confined
to my bed, and things looked very blue, for I was
getting no assistance from the physic I was taking,
and it seemed to me that I was a done man. I
had read of Clements Tonic, and asked if I would
give myself a last chance with that remedy. A
relative who had used it said ‘ yes,’ very emphati-
cally, and gave me her reasons.”
“ You were in such straits that you were willing
to accept almost any advice, I suppose ? ”
“Well, you see, there was scarcely anything
left for me to take, and as all other remedies had
proved futile, what was the good of going back to
them ? So I soon got some Clements Tonic, and
what a God-send it was, too. I was just about as
low as I could be, not having been outside the
house for a fortnight, and if it hadn’t been that
Clements Tonic was taken just in the nick of time
my ailments may have taken such a hold on my
system as to have defied all efforts at eradication. I
think it was pleurisy that had seized me, and, oh !
what a terrible cough I had—so painful and so
exhausting, that each bout aggravated my feeble-
ness. A great deal of phlegm came away, and one
would almost think I had consumption, to judge
by the pallor of my cheeks and the shrunken
state of my body. The pains in my lungs were
very acute, making me dread the necessity of
drawing my breath, as each time I did, a sensation
like a knife cutting made me writhe in agony. It
was not a life I cared to cling to, believe me,
for one would be far better off dead, and out of the
world altogether, than linger in such misery.”
“ What kind of nourishment were you ifi the
habit of taking ? ”
I was existing on cereal foods, and even that
there was a difficulty in digesting. Always head-
aches in the mornings, a nasty fur roofing my
mouth, which made me continue washingit during
the night, the dryness, too, being troublesome ;
and at least two mornings in the week I would
find myself vomiting. I was pitifully nervous and
shaky, and my mind was not at ease, either da_v
or night. I could not help thinking that some
great trouble was hanging over mvhead, threat-
ening, like the sword of Damocles, to descend
with destruction at any moment, and to tell you
the plain truth, my life was a burden to me.”
“ Were you long using Clements Tonic before
you felt any benefit ? ”
“Some little time passed before I noticed
an improvement, but then you must remem-
ber the circumstances—how thoroughly broken
down I was, and I think the marvel is
that I pulled round so well. But Clements
Tonic kept building me up, and restoring
my internal organs to a healthy state, until I was
as sound possible. What a remarkable thing
Clements Tonic is to make a person eat —wliv,
even on the hottest days it gave me a good
appetite, and such a splendid remedy for nervous-
ness and insomnia, too. For years I had suffered
from giddiness in a bad form. If I stooped to lace
my boots or anything, when I rose up I’d seem to
go round like a top, and even when out walking
I’d give a sudden reel occasionally, like a man who
had been indulging in something stronger than
lemonade.”
“ Do you get those sensations now ? ”
“No; they have quite left me, thanks to
Clements Tonic, and I have nothing to thank but
that medicine for ridding me of my cough, and
ultimately restoring me to the very soundest
health. So now you can publish these facts
broadcast.”

The story
told by parents who have
cured their children with
SCOTT’S Emulsion is al-
ways one of intense
satisfaction. Mrs. Hale,
23 College Street, Bal-
main, N.S.W. writes (Au-
gust 1908) : “My little
daughter Lilian was deli-
cate from birth, and was
such a poor, sickly little
child that I really thought
we should not be able to
rear her. She made very
little progress for the first
twelve months, but we
then tried
scorn
Emulsion
which built her up and did
her good where every-
thing else had failed.’*
Recoveries like this are the best
proof that there is something in
SCOTT’S which makes it different
from (and far superior to) any-
thing else, and every other emul-
sion, for wasting children. This
“something” is the power to cure,
and it is derived from the
high strength and perfect
purity of the ingredients
and their perfect and
palatable combination
by the unique SCOTT
process. Of all chemists
and dealers in medicines.

Jenny.
When Jenny feels good-natured how I love to see
her smile !
She is bright, and she is open, and so wholly free
from guile.
But when Jenny’s really naughty she’s a perfect
little dear,
And the language that she uses is an awful treat
to hear.
Then her golden hair goes curling in a most
delightful way,
And there comes a sudden lightning in her eyes
of sparkling grey ;
When she calls me names I listen, and I mostly
can agree
That I am the pig and donkey of her wrath’s
menagerie.
When her step is like a whirlwind and her tongue
is like a fire,
Then I feel that pretty Jenny is my very heart’s
desire;
Then the broken tea-cups scatter, and the jam is
on my shirt.
And Jenny is a cyclone in a whirling frilly skirt.
But the climax of enjoyment and the summit of
delight
Is when all her railings falter and her hands she
clenches tight,
When she’s said the things she wanted, and has
told me all I am,
And she stamps her wicked slipper on the rug
and utters “Damn.”

The Little Grinning Devil.
There’s a Little Grinning Devil jeers our efforts to
be good—
He has been our boon companion ev’ry day from
cradlehood ;
And in school, or church, or temple—aye, no,
matter when or where,
The Little Grinning Devil is predestined to be
there !
Let us will where we may wander, let us wander
where we will—
But the Little Grinning Devil is our bosom com-
rade still !
He’s the mocker of our morals, he’s the siren of our
sins
(He’s a Cunning Little Devil who contemptuously
grins !);
He’s the champion disturber when our virtues are
serene—
He’s the most outrageous demon that the world
has ever seen !
He’s at daggers drawn with sorrow and on kissing
terms with glee—
In that Little Devil’s absence what prosaic things
we’d be !
Never yet was maid so proper, never yet was maid
so chaste—
But the Little Grinning Devil had his arm around
her waist!
Never yet was maid so simple, never yet was
maid so shy—
But the Little Grinning Devil caught and kissed
her on the sly !
And he didn’t hear her protests, and he didn’t
mind her screams—
For the Little Grinning Devil was the Lover of
Her Dreams !
Many men have tried to squelch him on the holy
altar stairs—
But beheld him in the pulpit, where he parodies
our pray’rs !
And in deep and dark seclusion we have striven
to atone—
But the Little Grinning Devil hates to see a man
alone !
He’s the Unsubjected Ego that runs riot through
our lives—
And the gods must pack their baggage when his
Majesty arrives !
He’s the little fiend that gladdens, he’s the tiny
imp that cheers —
What though he digs us pitfalls in the Passage of
the Years !
For he is our patron Devil —and, regarding him as
such,
For myself I’ll make confession that I love him
very much !
Leave the Ten Commandments idle, put the
Bibles on the shelves—
For the Little Grinning Devil is a Portion of
Ourselves !

The Real People’s Land.
Do you know the real Real People’s land ?
I will take you there if you so command
To strip the veil from the past away,
To draw forth souls from the light of day ;
To show where the roots of motives twine.
Are you afraid lest a vagrant ray
Upon the hearts in our own breasts play,
Showing the self hid in yours and mine?
Would we enter the real Real People’s land ?
We must hold no brief at the world’s command,
No painted smile for the lying lips ;
Truth is stark from soles to finger tips.
No gracious fashion, no pretty phrase—
The bones peep white from the built-in vaults,
Lank skeletons of our buried faults
That were pink and white in the fleshly days.
It is far—-the real Real People’s land.
Shall we seek it, dear one, hand in hand?
All that the light of its suns can prove
In my heart for you is an honest love;
But you shake your head, and I hear you say,
With man’s mistrust for a woman’s whim
(For you like your lamps rose-shaded, dim)
“Tis not well to go there ev’ry day !”

No dull blades —
and no need for new ones
Smooth, close, 1 quick, comfortable
shaving is possible only with a blade that
is properly stropped each time it is used.
The self-contained stropping arrange-
ment of the Auto Strop Safety Razor
enables you to keep a hair-edge on
each blade for many months. Remem-
ber, no skill or experience is necessary
to keep Auto Strop blades in perfect
condition. You also avoid the buying
of new blades necessary with all
non-stropping razors, and thus the
Auto Strop Safety Razor pays for
itself in a year. There is no handling
of the blade or taking anything apart
for either stropping or cleaning.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tub Bulletin would oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by talcing some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no- ease be to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor. Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
ojiicials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

ALFRED DEAKIN FIXES UP A
FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT.
After much conflict, the secret caucus of Pre-
miers has arrived at a sort of arrangement as to
the future division of the tariff revenue. Two of
the seven Premiers who made the arrangement
hang on by a majority of one ; and three, includ-
ing the two who have a majority of one (the figures
sound like the tariff at a cheap variety show) de-
pend entirely on the recently purchased support
of their previous enemies. So the gathering
wasn’t a strikingly representative affair. Alfred
Deakin met the State Premiers in the position of
the man who rushes headlong into the Hebrew’s
office and says he must have the money at once ;
and the State Premiers met Deakin as does the
Hebrew whose premises are thus rushed, and
said, like the Hebrew, that if the “monish”
was wanted in such haste as all that the
interest would be high. The Braddon clause
can’t be abolished except with the consent of the
State Parliaments, until the end of 1910 —16
months ahead. For another 16 months the States
are entitled to three-fourths of the Customs and
Excise revenue whether the Commonwealth sinks
or swims, and whether the Commonwealth pays
old-age pensions or not. After that time the
Commonwealth can, if it desires, keep all tile
Customs and Excise revenue. Therefore any
Australian Government which can keep financi-
ally afloat for another 16 months can make its
own terms. But Deakin has failed to keep afloat.
He doesn’t float any better than an anchor. As
the price of office lie abandoned all ideas of rais-
ing further revenue by a Federal progressive land-
tax or income-tax. He joined himself with the
crowd which says that the builders of the Consti-
tution never “contemplated ” Federal direct
taxation ; also to the crowd which objects to
the raising of any further revenue by means
of the tariff. With so many possible
sources of revenue cut off, the Fused Government
found itself, the other day, with a prospective
shortage of £1,200,000, and to face a general elec-
tion with that incubus would be little different
from political suicide. The “monish” was wanted
at once. So a Fuse, with a hunted expression in
its eye, put this question to the State Premiers :
“How much a year for ever afterwards (to be
paid by the community at large) is the price at
which you will relax the Braddon clause now,
and thus enable us to get through and possibly
keep our billets?”
* * • *
The price was high—naturally. A person who
seems as if wild dogs or police were after him can’t
raise the wind instantly at a low rate. Even the
most conscientious pawnbroker charges extra if
the customer who is trying to pawn the cruet
looks as if he had just committed murder.
The arrangement arrived at is that the State
Governments are to receive for ever (though
that really only means until the people see tit to
alter the Constitution again) £1 ss. per inhabitant
per annum out of the Customs and Excise receipts.
(There are certain temporary concessions to Wes-
tralia, but they don’t seriously alter the situation.)
Then the Commonwealth becomes responsible for
old-age pensions—hithertoa purely Stateliability—
and on present calculations they represent about
9s. per inhabitant per annum. That isequivalent
to leaving things on the old footing and guaran-
teeing the States an annual subsidy of 345. per
head. If the Commonwealth wants 16s. per in-
habitant for itself—though unless there is to be
very heavy Federal direct taxation the amount is
absurdly small, being only about half what Britain
spends on defence alone—it must raise 50s. per
inhabitant yearly by the tariff. That would
really leave it just about where it would be if the
Braddon clause had been made perpetual. If
the Commonwealth wants 265. per inhabitant
annually for itself without resorting to direct
taxation, then, in order to get it and to pay the
State subsidies and old-age pensions, it must raise
£3 annually per head by tariff means —yet 265.
per head is less than the amount which Britain
spends on defence alone. Roughly speaking, this
is the situation on the £3 basis
Allotted thus.

And so on ad infinitum.
The number of objections that can be urged
against this wretchedly incompetent scheme are
almost past counting. To begin with, it assumes
the raising of an almost impossible tariff
revenue. Germany is a rich country with a
massive tariff, yet it only collects about 20s.
annually from each German out of Customs and
Excise. France is a rich country with a high
tariff, yet it only raises about 10s. per head per
annum from Customs ; and when everything that
can by any reasonable pretence be called
Excise is placed under the tariff heading the
total doesn’t seem more than 255. per head. The
United States, high as its tariff is and rich as the
country is, only contrives to raise about 13s. 6d.
per Yankee annually by Customs and 12s. 6d. per
annual Yankee in the way of “internal revenue”
—making 265. in all. The fact is that Aus-
tralia’s Customs revenue is wholly abnormal
and artificial. It might be briefly described
as bogus. This country imports far more
per head than it can pay for—far more
than it will be able to import when things settle
down to a fair, ordinary level. The enormous
amount it has raised by land sales, the immense
gold output and the stupendous foreign borrow-
ings have enabled it to buy foreign goods at a rate
in proportion to its population which no other
country has ever approached, and these im-
ports have temporarily bloated the tariff returns
out of all recognition. They suggest the un-
healthy enlargement of one who has been three
weeks drowned. The falling away of land sales,
the decline of the gold output, and the fact that
there must be a limit to foreign borrowing make
it absolutely certain that this country will have to
buy less abroad and make more goods for itself,
and a stupendous falling away in the tariff re-
venue per head is therefore as certain as the sun-
sec. In fact, it is visibly beginning already.
Between 1903 and 1905 the drop amounted to
about a million and a quarter, despite the growth
of population. Then the new tariff shoved the
figures up again; but as local manufactures con-
tinued to take the place of imports, another
decline set in immediately, and is still in pro-
gress. When things reach their true level, it will
probably be found that Alfred Dkakin, as the
price of a temporary aid to his muddled and
incompetent finances, has promised the State
Governments permanently more out of the tariff
revenue than the whole tariff revenue will amount
to a few years hence.
■*•-***
Regarded as a permanent arrangement that 255.
per head per annum is superfluity as well as im-
possibility. It takes far more money per head
to govern a thinly-peopled than a thickly-peopled
country, for the simple reason that while a town
of 1000 people may require a magistrate and a fire
brigade, oneof 3,000,000 people doesn’t necessarily
require 3000 magistrates and 3000 fire-brigades.
N.S.W., with 1,500,000 people, may require
£1,875,000 a year, or 255. per head, to carry on
with, but it is sheer lunacy to. suppose that a
future N.S.W., with 15,000,000 people, and with
a State Government that has no land or sea
defence, or lighthouses, or postal and telegraphic
extensions to pay for, can require £18,750,000 to
struggle along with—that in addition to its rail-
way and tramway profits, land-tax, income-tax,
land revenues, stamp and probate duties and sun-
dries. Superfluity is no name for such an
arrangement.
* * * *
The agreement which Alfred Deakin has
fixed up as the price of relief from the financial
difficulties of the next few months gives the State
Governments a first mortgage on the existing
tariff revenue as well as on all future increase of
revenue. The States are to be preference share-
holders. or debenture-holders. If the revenue
drops, the loss is to be wholly borne by the Com-
monwealth ; if it rises the States are to share in
the profit, for it can be fairly assumed that the
revenue won’t rise except along with an increase
of population. Moreover, the State claims upon
the tariff revenue will increase whether the
tariff revenue increases or not; and they will
increase even while the tariff revenue is growing
less. The demands of the States won’t stop at
the three-fourths fixed by the old Braddon
clause ; they will almost certainly get far beyond
that, and will probably amount in time to the
whole lot or more than the whole lot. If a State
brings in 20,000 poor and frugal immigrants they
may add very little to the tariff returns, but they
will certainly add £25.000 a year to the State’s
claims upon the tariff returns. Assuming that
an immigrant lives after arrival here for an aver-
age of 30 years, that means a total bill for
£750,000 on account of these 20,000 frugal immi-
grants, to say nothing of the bill for their children
and their children’s children, and quiteignoring the
additional claims they will make on the old-age
pensions fund. Yet with every addition tothepopu-
lation the tariff receipts per head will grow less.
The gold yield, the land sales revenue and the
loan money, which made a notable addition to the
importing capacity per head of 500,000 people,
won’t make much visible addition to the import-
ing capacity of 5,000,000 people, even if these
three sources of income were permanent—which
they are not.
* * * *
The proposed agreement can’t legally come into
force until a popular vote is taken upon the sub-
ject at next General Election, which is due seven
or eight months hence. Nevertheless it is to come
into force at once in an informal fashion, and the
payments to the States will be immediately cut
down. But they won’t be cut down very far.
The Fused Government sees a deficit of £1,200,000
ahead as the result of its incompetent financing,
notwithstanding the fact that it takes no account
in its estimates of the cost of the Northern
Territory, the two transcontinental railways and
the Federal capital ; that it largely shirks the
defence question and wholly shirks the immigra-
tion question. In return for pawning Australia’s
whole future to the State Treasurers, the Fused
Government is to be allowed this year an extra
£OOO,OOO. That will leave it with £GOO.OOO of a
deficit. Still the reduction of the deficit may
help it a little in the miserable struggle
to retain its Fused job. But if the people
decline to sanction the proposed arrangement all
this extra money will have to be paid back to the
State Governments, and then the Deakin-Cook
accounts will look a lot worse—will look, in fact,
as bad as they do now. Until the people sanc-
tion the proposed change any extra money which
the Fused Government may acquire under it is
mere trust money, so the Fused crowd will simply
appeal to the community as an unreliable bailee
who is short in his accounts. And it is quite pos-
sible that the people will repudiate the whole
business. They will certainly repudiate it if they
realise that for the sake of enabling the Fused
push to make a better showing before the electors
it is proposed to sacrifice all the benefits that were
expected when the Braddon clause ran out, and
to create an ever-increasing liability which will
in the end swallow up everything.
Even if the people endorse the proposal, the
endorsement isn’t likely to hold good for more
than three years at the outside. By that time the
community will have had time to realise what an
impossible responsibility it has been fooled into
un.lertaking on behalf of the State Treasurers,
and another amendment of the Constitution-
undertaken, perhaps, without any pretence of
consulting the State authorities —will sweep the
whole arrangement away. There is no means by
which a subsidy agreement can be nailed down
and made fixed and permanent—none whatever.
The immovable system of the Medes and Persians
is played out. The only way in which finality
can be arrived at is by the complete separation of
State and Federal finance—by the States abandon-
ing all claims upon the tariff revenue and per-
suading the Commonwealth to take over their
debts, or part of their debts, as a quid pro quo.
This was William Lyne’s proposition, and it would
have spelt finality; but unfortunately the benighted
State Premiers couldn’t see the point. If the debts
were once taken over by the Commonwealth that
institution might want some day to hand them
back, but the short and effective reply of the
State Parliaments would be: “They- are your
debts now. If you don’t like to keep them you
can drop them or repudiate them, and the dis-
grace will be yours. But we are done with them.”
So there would be a definite end to the financial
controversy, but there is no other definite end in
sight.
THE LAMENTABLE IMPORTANCE OF
UNIMPORTANT PEOPLE.
Australia has lately been annoyed by the habit
which some very small people have of mistaking
themselves for the entire community. The most
notable fly that got in the road was Mr. Wade,
State Premier of N.S.W. When the secret caucus
of Premiers met recently at Melbourne the pain-
fully affable Deakin propounded a theory whereby
the six State Parliaments, by passing six Bills
through 12 Houses of Legislature, with three
readings of each Bill in each House, should
transfer to the Commonwealth the sole control of
industrial legislation ; and the Australian Parlia-
ment, by passing one Bill through two more
Houses, with three readings in each House,
should accept the said control. That is
one way by' which a very essential re-
form might be brought about, and not only
is it a large and circuitous way, but it has the
serious drawback that it embodies no reference
to the people, therefore the State Legislatures
might surrender the authority in question when
the community really didn’t want it to be sur-
rendered. The other way of arriving at the same
end is to leave the State Legislatures out of con-
sideration altogether ; to enact-the transfer of in-
dustrial legislation to the Commonwealth by an
Act of the Australian Parliament; and then to
submit that Act, as an amendment of the Con-
stitution, to the people for acceptance or rejection.
Thus the people would decide, whereas, unless
the people were directly consulted, they would
have no chance to explain their views. The
amendment of the Constitution is distinctly the
better idea of the two, though the lamentable
affability of Deakin inclines him, as usual, to the
worst way.
* * »
About the need for the transfer of industrial
legislation to the Federal power there is no pos-
sible doubt. Australia is divided into six States,
and five of them have made some pretence of
dealing with this question by creating Wages
Boards and the like. The sixth State (backward
Tasmania) has no industrial legislation worth
mentioning, and wages thex-e are just as low and
hours just as long as the employer can contrive to
make them. Nowadays the Commonwealth has a
uniform tariff and no border duties, but while the
State which pays fair wages is protected against
the foreign sweater it has no protection against
the inter-State sweater. The ultimate result must
be that the most work will go to the place
which pays the worst wages, and so there
will arise a diseased form of internal com-
petition which can be very little better than
the worst variety of foreign competition. Out of
this evil grows another, for old age pensions are
now a Federal concern, chargeable to the country
at large. In the extra low-wage State the
worker is least able to provide for his old age by
his own efforts, so it follows that the low-wage
State will have an absurdly high proportion of
pensioners, while the better-managed State, with
a lower proportion of pensioners, will have to
carry part of the low-wage State’s burden. In
other words, a low-wage State like Tasmania will
become a huge pauper, receiving alms from places
like N.S.W., Queensland and S. A. These States
have already one horrible and expensive pauper
on their hands, for the great land monopolies of
Victoria have driven the young agriculturists out
wholesale, and made Bent’s country pre-eminently
the land of old derelicts. Victoria’s proportion
of old-age pensioners is so absurdly high that it
promises to be very considerable of a pauper,
living on the charity of its neighbors. But that
unpleasant fact is no reason why Australia should
be searching for another pauper. The remedy for
one kind of pauper is a Federal progressive land-
tax to prevent any one State becoming essentially
the home of land monopolies. The remedy for
the other is Federal control of industrial legisla-
tion to prevent any one State becoming essentially
the home of sweated labor.
» * » •
As might naturally be expected, State Premier
Wade, of N.S.W., the very ordinary lawyer with
the harsh countenance, rose in vigorous opposition
to Alp. Deakin’s mild proposal. Wade points
out that industrial legislation was left to the State
Governments by the original Constitution, and
so it is one of the State Rights of which Wade
is the self-appointed defender. If Tasmania can
be induced to establish a Wages Board system or
some similar device, Wade remarks that the
States will all have industrial legislation of some
kind, and if there are six different varieties of
industrial legislation in the Commonwealth,
Wade badly wants to know what on earth anybody
can want with one uniform system of industrial legis-
lation. In any case, Wade is prepared to fight to
the last against “Federal encroachments.” It
doesn’t matter to Wade that there is no guarantee
that Tasmania will follow the lead of the other
States. Nor does it signify to Wade that the
different State courts fix different hours, wages and
conditions ; that no two States can agree as to
what trades should be regulated and what
should not; that there are all manner
of discrepancies as to whether awards should
extend over the whole State or over part of the
State'; that the laws are wildly diverse ; and that
if one State proposes a reform in its methods the
chance of getting the other five to agree to exactly
the same reform is practically nil. These valu-
ations may be inconvenient and disastrous to the
Australian people, but in the view of Wade
“State Rights” are of far more importance than
the well-being of the Australian people. In this
matter the amazing woodenness of Wade and his
class asserts itself. They can see the advantage
of a uniform Customs tariff because that was in
the original Constitution. They can’t see the
advantages of a uniform industrial tariff because
that wasn't in the original Constitution. Change
of any kind is abhorrent to the Wades of this
world.
a * * »
The State Rights creed is such a gigantic and
insolent denial of the self-governing privileges of
the Australian nation that a more crude and law-
less community might be moved to protest with
violence, and hang some prominent State Righter
from the top of an herb. The people who
desire to add the control of industrial legislation
to the Federal powers, or to make any other
additions to the Federal powers, by amendment
of the Constitution, do not propose to trespass in
any way on the rights of the people. They simply
propose to ask the people by referendum whether
they prefer Federal industrial legislation or not.
That is the only way in which the Federal Con-
stitution can be altered or enlarged—by the vote
of the people. It is suggested that if the people
badly want Federal industrial legislation they
should have the chance to say so, and if they
don’t want it they should be allowed to explain
that they prefer to do without it. Therefore
those who advocate this amendment of the
Constitution desire most particularly to respect
the rights of the people, and of the States which
are the people. On the other side of the case
stand Gregory Wade and his State Rights
friends. Gregory Wade can’t see what possible
claim the people can have to govern themselves,
or what claim anybody has to govern them except
Gregory Wade and individuals of his sort. It
may be—it probably is—that the people of the
State of N.S.W. want Federal control of indus-
trial affairs. If they do they can’t announce the
fact clearly at either a State or a Federal election,
for when two dozen questions are all mixed to-
gether no one can, simply by voting for Smith or
against Jones, fully express his views on all of
them, or even on any one of them. In the
absence of the plain, business-like referendum,
the only way in which it is possible that the
people of N.S.W. or any other State may declare
their opinions on Federal industrial legislation or
any other matter is by the taking of a vote on a
proposed amendment of the Federal Constitution.
And here Gregory Wade rushes in to explain
that it would be an outrage upon the rights of
N.S.W. and the other States if the people of
N.S.W. and the other States were permitted to
freely express their views on any such subject.
In the matter of encroachment upon the rights of
the States Wade and Co., who thus attempt to
prevent the State’s citizens declaring how they
want to be governed, seem the most bumptious
and impertinent gang of encroachers that Aus-
tralia possesses.
* » * *
A good deal of the trouble lies in the utter
inability of people like Wade to understand
the position they occupy in the scheme of things.
State Rights are certainly very real and very
important. They consist of the right of the
States —that is of the people who compose the
States and who also compose Australia—to say as
clearly as possible how they desire to manage their
own affairs. They include the right of the people
to say how far they want their affairs to be
managed in a Federal sense by Deakin or Fisher,
and how far they want them to be supervised in a
mere local sense by Kidston, Wade, John
Weary, Peake, Newton Moore and Elliott
Lewis. If the Australian Parliament passed
a Bill providing for the transfer to the
Federal authority of the control of industrial
legislation it must submit it to a popular vote
before it could become law. But the proposal to
submit any such measure to the people of the States
is denounced by Wade as an encroachment on
State Rights, because, in Wade’s view, State
Rights consist of the right of Wade to deprive his
State of the right to even consider any proposal of
which Wade doesn’t approve. This viewof thecase
suggests a wholly inordinate and absurd concep-
tion on Wade’s part of Wade’s importance.
Wade may be very important, but he isn’t so
important as all that. The entire doctrine of
State Rights is based on the off-hand assumption
by Wade and Kidston and John Weary and
their tribe that the people of the States must, as
a matter of course, want to be ruled as much as
possible by Kidston and Wade and John Weary
and co., and as little as possible by Deakin or
Fisher. They profess that this fact is so self-
evident that any attempt to permit the people to
express any opinion to the contrary is an outrage
on the people of Australia, who are also the States
of Australia. And, unfortunately, Alfred Deakin
is too futile and too affable to treat these
impertinent little tyrants as they deserve.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Imperialists and Confidence-Tricksters Too.
In the words of Reuter (17/8/’O9), " the arrange-
ment between the Admiralty and the Common-
wealth in connection with the Defence Conference
is entirely satisfactory to Australian national
sentiment.” Reuter is correct. The British
Admiralty, according to the obviously inspired
cable message of last week, in direct opposition to
th© views of our local amateur strategists, has
laid it down that Australia shall be defended in
future, not by a more or less negligible section ot
the British navy, but by its own fleet. The sea-
defence of the Commonwealth is to be put up,
not in the distant Baltic or North Bea, but in the
adjacent Pacific. The personnel of the ships
will necessarily be mainly British for a while.
But "the establishment of one or more train-
ing colleges ” is projected, in order that Aus-
tralians may be taught how to man their
own vessels, and, as soon as may be, an inter-
change of naval officers will begin between British
and Australian warships. The valuelessness to
Australia of a Dreadnought is recognised ; and as
the United Kingdom doesn’t want one of these
massive craft from this country, the Dreadnought
" gift ” money is to be allocated to the construc-
tion of a couple of fast cruisers which shall
operate in Australian waters, and form part and
parcel of the Australian fleet. And, last and most
important, the said fleet, when it eventuates, is to
belong absolutely to Australia. S. M. Herald
put the position fairly when it remarked (19/8/’09):
Even a possible Labor Administration will find nothing
to grumble at in an arrangement that leaves complete
control of our ships to us in peace time, and leaves it to
us to place them, we hope unreservedly, at the disposal of
the Empire in time of war.
But there are some features of this latest develop-
ment of the local naval defence position, which
the Herald omitted to mention. Three months
ago Alfred Deakin decided to put the Labor
Government out of office and seize the Prime
Ministership himself. His expressed reason was
Fisher’s mad and dingoistie conduct in opposing
the Age and Sydney TELEGRAPH-fomented Dread-
nought idiocy. Deakin owned to being in agree-
ment with most of the fiscal and industrial
legislation which Fisher’s party projected. Also
he favored the same party’s proposals for coastal
defence, tie found but one defect in the Fisher
make-up and that of his party-—namely their in-
difference to the craze for giving Britain a Dread-
nought. So Deakin went regretfully away and
fused with Joe Cook. Now, consider Deakin’s
position. The Motherland refuses to Vie given a
Dreadnought wherewith to defend itself from
Germany. Nor will it accept any other present
of the kind. Bo Deakin is holding a Prime
Ministership which he acquired under false pre-
tences. He dispossessed Fisher of the job on the
plea that the immediate presentation of a Dread-
nought to Britain was a crying imperial necessity.
The whole idea has been turned down at the
headquarters of Empire for the blamed foolishness
it is. The headquarters of Empire has decided
firmly that in this matter Fisher was a wise man,
and that Deakin and Cook were fools—and
Fused ones at that. Yet, even after this
severe snub, Deakin bangs on to office as
though the move that landed him there had
been enthusiastically ratified in the Cold Land.
Equally anomalous is the position of Mayor
Allen Taylor, of Sydney, and his amazing
“ Dreadnought Fund.” Even as Alfred Deakin
collected the Prime Ministership on the false pre-
tence that he was going to use it to provide the
Motherland with a battleship, so Allen Taylor
has, unless the Anti-Sosh papers lie, collected
nearly £lOO,OOO of N.S.W. cash on the same
bogus understanding. The last shadow of a possi-
bility of Australia spending a farthing on a Dread-
nought or other article for the purposes of purely
British defence, vanished with the publication, last
week, of the Defence Conference’s decision. Cer-
tainly so-called Dreadnought money will fie dis-
bursed; but it is to be used for a purpose (the
augmenting, namely, of the infant Australian
navy) which is calculated to drive the normal
Dreadnoughter into a frenzy of passion. It
is painful to conceive the frame of mind of the
excitable and ungrammatical Abbey Dangar when
lie learns that his £lO.OOO may fie spent, after all,
on the "miserable proposal” for an Australian
fleet. And great will be the grief of Willy
Kelly when he appreciates that his £lOO is to
travel the same route ; and the anguish of Little
Amy from Leichhardt, when she grasps that her
3d. is to tie misapplied, will be heart-rending to
witness. There is only one logical and honest
course for Alfred Deakin to pursue, viz., to
resign his unjustly-acquired billet forthwith ; and
as for Allen Taylor, the sooner he desists from
wringing cash from Ma State Imperialists by
false representations, and restores such coin as he
has already wrung from them, the better for his
good fame.

The Proposed Deviation of the Transcon-
tinental Railway.
Some fatuous people want to turn the transconti-
nental line into a zig-zag, in order to reach the
"beautiful country” in sou’-west Queensland.
Hereunder “ Mallarapoonie ” describes some of
the aforesaid "beautiful country”:-
Six or seven miles northerly by the Bedourie mailman’s
bridle-track from the little decayed township of Birdsville,
at Queensland’s back gate, stands Mount Lewis—barren,
bald and grim.
The view from the summit of that naked limestone
knob is rather extensive, and can be highly recommended
as an object lesson to all who favor the deviation of Aus-
tralia’s proposed transcontinental railway through
south-western Queensland. I have gazed out on some
pitikss scenery in different parts of Australia in
my time, but I hand the Mount Lewis view the
damper for desolation, barrenness arid the blight of utter
despair. Good seasons or bad, the view is much the same,
and is characteristic of a great deal of the sou’-west
corner.
Eastward from the summit of Mount Lewis one looks
for miles across the innumerable ensts of undulating
sandhills, trending mostly north and south. At about
12 miles the regularity of the sand-dune succession is
broken by a long low line of dark-green river timber, which,
winding among the hummocks of glittering sand, comes
out of the haze of the N.E. horizon, and sinks into haze
again. This is the fringe of the scattered channels of the
Diameritina.
Beyond the river channels, beyond the dark fringe of
timber, and looming in strong- relief above the distant
green, rise the bare, wind-swept summits of furtherdunes
—hummock beyond hummock to the horizon —red-grey
sand, baldly glistening in the sun.
To the south, south-west and west lies a sea of sand
which sweeps against the foot-slopes of Mount Lewis, as
an ocean upon some headland.
Sand, sand, sand as far as the eye can reach, red-grev
and forbidding.
Sandhill is reared behind sandhill, crest beyond crest,
sand-wave beyond sand-wave, out into purplish blue,
where a brazen, cloudless sky stoops down to the shimmer-
ing wastes.
Far to the south-west, hardly distinguishable by the
unaided eye, hangs a pall of deeper purple. It liangs
over that terrible tract—Sturt’s Stony Desert.
Northward, from west to east of north, outspreading
from the feet of Mount Lewis to the remote horizon, piti-
less and vast, and only dotted here and there with naked
limestone knobs, unbroken by tree or shrub, flat, water-
less, and drear, stretches the Oacory Desert, arid,
sinister and red.
Desolation and silence environ Mount Lewis, and
stretch to the horizon and beyond. It is the Great Dead
Heart.
And why it should be proposed to drag a railway
through those lonely wastes only Heaven and some
cranky politicians know.

For Public Information.
This paper took prompt measures against those
organs of public opinion which reprinted the
gross libel that had its origin in the Brisbane
Worker. As a result, the Sydney Watchman on

columns, and those of a number of other papers in
Queensland and elsewhere, in addition to paying
all legal costs :
THE BRISBANE “WORKER’S” SHOCKING
REVELATION.
Slandering “ The Bulletin.”
CORRECTION AND APOLOGY.
Under the heading of “ A Shocking Revelation,” an
article appeared a couple of weeks ago in the Brisbane
Worker, in which it was stated:—
“People who wondered why Sydney Bulletin so
suddenly ceased its condemnations of the Kid-Piiilp coali-
tion, need wonder no longer. A question asked and
answered in the Queensland Assembly last week has
solved the mystery. The sum of £2O per issue for 12
months is being ladled out to the red-faced Bully for
advertising the advantages of this State as a field for
settlement. Just prior to the fixing up of the contract
the Bulletin, in the excess of its disgust at Kidston’s
coalition conduct, had declared it wouldn’t be found dead
in the same paddock with him. And those who still re-
tained faith in the democracy of the great Protectionist
organ that is printed on Freetrade paper, rejoiced exceed-
ingly thereat. With the formidable Bully on their side,
they felt that the coalition would soon receive its quietus.
But, alas, a change came o’er the spirit of their dream!
The Bully’s denunciations of Kidston’s treachery suddenly
petered out. A deathly silence about the coalition per-
vaded its columns all at once.”
This article was reprinted without comment in the
Watchman. We find now that the Worker’s charge is
absolutely without foundation, and we very much regret
the republication of the article, and take this opportunity
to unreservedly apologise for any reflection cast on the
reputation of Tim Bulletin.
Tim Bulletin points out that it never made any con-
tract with the Coalition Government, that its contract
was dated three months before the coalition took place ;
that when it denounced the Kiustox-Piiilp Government
it was denouncing a profitable advertiser, and that not
only was it not in any way to cease its hostility to the
Queensland Coalition, but that a perusal of its pages
would show that its hostility had never ceased. The
Worker story it denounces as a complete fabrication.
On inspecting the documents, the Watchman finds that
The Bulletin’s account of the circumstances is absolutely
correct.
VIEW IN THE MACDONNELL RANGES, CENTRE OF AUSTRALIA, where the alleged
“Desert Railway” (Port Darwin to Port Augusta) is to pass.
Victorian Bushrangers : A.D. 1909.
The unconscionable cadgers who live on the big
and mostly unused blocks in the Rodney irriga-
tion district (Vic.) moved even Agricultural
Minister Graham to violent language the other
day. When Elwqod .Mead reached Australia,
that competent irrigationist speedily found that,
but for a few inconsiderable exceptions, Victoria’s
irrigation policy has so far been a swindle and a
fraud, worked for the advantage of the land-
owner. Mead’s idea was that the State should
bring water along main channels and charge every
landowner enough to pay expenses and interest on
the outlay, and that it should also make him pay
whether he used the fluid or not. Likewise he
reckoned it a fair thing that the Anti-
Bosh landowner should construct his own dis-
tributing channels, just as he has to do in every
other country where irrigation is practised. Here
he struck his first snag. The landowners in the
already irrigated districts—Rodney, Bwan Hill,
.and the like —-had had their distributing channels
built for them by a foolish Government—which
was mostly Duncan Gillies and Alfred the
Affable—so the men in the new and proposed dis-
tricts demanded the same concession. Mead had
to do as his Government bosses told him. “ Very
good,” he said. "we will bring the water right to
their doors, but they will have to pay working ex-
penses and interest charges on the whole amount
expended.” That sum he worked out at ss. per
acre per annum per foot depth of water, which is -
about half the sum charged elsewhere. And not
only would the new men have to pay it, but the
landowners of Rodney and other "old” dis-
tricts would also pay on the same basis.
As soon as Rodney had grasped the idea, it arose
as one robber and roared. Then it sppke to
Minister McKenzie, Swan Hill’s member, who
listened attentively and replied softly. Then it
tackled Murray, who sent up Elwood Mead,
Minister Graham going with him. But Rodney
declined to listen to Mead. It had a list of ques-
tions it said it wanted answered, but it absolutely
declined to show Mead the list or ask Mead the
questions. Nevertheless, like its sow at home, it
was quite firm on one point—it wanted to return
to its wallow. "Gimme back me Trust,” it said.,
“ Gimme back me Trust.” And then Graham let
himself go in this good plain English :
I am surprised at the deliberate attempt now being
made in Rodney to rob the State of a large sum of money.
It is nothing but robbery. . . The Rodney irrigation
scheme has cost the State £620,000, out of which they are
required to pay interest on £270,000 only, the State
having shouldered the balance of £350,000. When they
originally became a Trust they voluntarily offered to pay
£32,472 per annum for the use of the water. They have
never kept their word, and now, when we offer them
double the quantity of water and better terms, they
refuse to pay even £21,000 perannum. Why, in Heaven’s
name, should the waterless farmers in the Mallee and the
flooded-out settlers in Gippsland, who have had far less
State assistance, be taxed to bear the burdens of these
comparatively luxuriously-situated landowners?
Among other grievances, it seems, Rodney com-
plains that the Trust won’t construct any further
subsidiary channels until the land to be served
is cut up and settled. The landowner wants
channels built by the State all over his hold-
ing ; that done, he could sell at a gorgeous
price while carefully passing the bill, in the
shape of increased charges for these smaller
channels, on to the purchaser. In other words,
he wants to have the channels made so that he
can charge the purchaser of the subdivision for
them, though he knows quite well that the
purchaser will have to pay the State in the shape
of increased rates. But fortunately Mead knows
the won’t-irrigate sharks, and so their game is
spoiled—provided always Mead gets the requisite
backing from Government and Parliament.

More “ Desert Railway.”
Providence has dropped a lot of rain recently
upon Australia, but very little of it has fallen
upon the route of the proposed deviation of the
transcontinental railway through Western Queens-
land and Western N.S.W. ; and the deviaters,
who want to turn a great national work into aline
built for the purely local profit of certain States,
feel hurt at this omission on the part of Provi-
dence. The deviaters are short of arguments,
though they hope that sheer parish-minded selfish-
ness may get them votes, and if the torrents which
have, lately been wasting themselves at Ballarat
had fallen instead upon Birdsville, and given them
an opportunity just fora moment to declare that
their awful route wasn’t such .a desert after all,
they would have felt better. But Birdsville, in
south-western Queensland, the country through
which it is proposed that the railway
deviation should go, remains dry. Birdsville,
in fact, almost always remains dry. During the
hist 14 years its average rainfall has been less
than 6& inches per year, and in two years out of
the last seven the year’s record has been down to
about inches. Windorah and Thargomindah,
also in south-western Queensland, but much
nearer the coast, average about Ilf inches each
per annum, though in 1902 Windorah had less
than 6in., and in 1905 it had less than 4in. ;
and Thargomindah had less than inches in 1902
and less than 4f inches in 1905. It is with the
view of bringing the transcontinental line, at great
additional length and cost, through this West
Queensland country that Australia is urged to
abandon the straight, short line from north to
south, and build a wandering, dissipated sort of
railway into the Eastern States. After the line
has passed through the country lying between
Birdsville and Thargomindab, where the rainfall
drops at times to 3in. per annum, it is to go on
into N.S.W. and gladden the country up by
Milparinka in the north of the State (about Bfin.
of rain per annum), and Wilcannia (lOin. per
annum) and join with Broken Hill (9in. per
annum) and finally hurry on to Euston and Went-
worth in the south of the State (rainfall about
12in.). Almost all these places have a lower rain-
fall than Alice Springs, which represents prac-
tically the centre of Australia and the centre of a
direct Port Darwin-Port Augusta railway, and
this point makes it hard to build up a case for the
deviation, seeing that it will (1) involve much
extra mileage and cost; (2) involve leaving most
of the Federal property of the Territory un-
developed ; (3) involve the spending of a vast
amount of the money of all Australia on
the development—if such a country can
be developed—of two States; (4) place the
transcontinental line under four separate
controls—those of the Commonwealth and three
States; (5) deprive the Commonwealth of control
of the southern terminus of the line ; (6) make
connection with Westralia practically impossible ;
and (7) involve the abandonment of some hun-
dreds of miles of line already constructed. If
there had only been floods last week at Birdsville,
instead of Ballarat, so as to make some semblance
of green feed along the deviation track, it would
have been a comfort. But the deviation people
hope that everybody will vote for bringing the
railway as near as possible to his own backyard,
regardless of the interests of Australia ; and as
there are more backyards in Queensland, N.S.W.
and Victoria than in S.A. and Westralia, the
backyard vote may win in the end.
An Army of Children or Adults—Which?
At Goulburn (N.S.W.) last week District Com-
mandant Gordon delivered himself of this bit of
foolishness, and the Fused press applauded it
warmly :
He thought that in training the youth in the early
stages Australia was creating a precedent which would
run through the whole of the Empire. There was the
idea a little time ago that there should he compulsory
universal training from 18 to 21. He thought there was
a flaw in that scheme. They lost the boys from 14 to 18.
They lost a lad at the time he was most fit. Between 18
and 21 most young men were settling themselves in com-
mercial life. That was the very time it had been sug-
gested to take them away from work. A lad should not
be taken away from his work when he was getting into
business.
It is a point on which any civilian who knows
conditions abroad is competent to express an
opinion. France and Germany, the two great
nations which have had practical experience in
the above regard, rebut utterly the theory that
the compulsorily-trained soldier gives most satis-
faction, or, indeed, any satisfaction at all, when
caught in childhood. In the Kaiser’s country
liability to join the Imperial army begins
at 17 years of age. But in effect the
recruit is 20 before his service starts. He
puts in two years’ hard training, and is
then passed into the reserve. There is one
point on which every German whom the writer
has encountered—and he has met some hundreds
in his time—is agreed, namely, that if any defect
is to be found in the Fatherland’s military system
it lies in the enlisting of recruits too early. There
are many Germans who advocate more matured
recruits; practically none who hold that the
young men of the nation should start their train-
ing at an earlier age than that now fixed by law.
That it should be seriously suggested in Germany
—as it is in Australia by the Deakin-Cook Fuse—
that a national army be inaugurated with lads
of 14, would appeal to the nations that know
as a horribly bad jest. And so in France,
where both liability to serve and service itself
starts at 20 years of age. Exploded these 20
years is General Gordon’s idea that it is detri-
mental to the nation to take its youths away for
military training purposes at a time when they
might be settling in commercial life or to
other work. That was the reactionary cry
in France immediately after Sedan. So skilled
and impartial an observer as Hamkrton has
actually picked out (vide Chapter on Patriotic
Duty in "French and English”) as one of the
principal benefits to France of the Franco-Prussian
war, "the healthy revolution concerning uni-
versal service ” which followed upon it. He notes
that in France, under universal service, “ the
humblest military duty is now honorable,” and
the army which was regarded by the people in the
days of the “caste” system with distrust has
come to be looked upon as the pride and strength
of the nation. Nor has trade or individual
wealth suffered in the slightest. This later
passage, from the same work, is suggestive in
another connection :
The absolute unity of sentiment between the military
and civil populations is a great compensation for the
burden of universal service. Another is the increase of
manliness and the improvement of national health. Of
the reality of this improvement I cannot entertain a
doubt, having frequently known young men who had
gained greatly in strength and activity by their military
service, and who felt and acknowledged the benefit.
The sons of peasants acquire Home education in the army.
The sons of gentlemen, besides the benefit of physical
exercise, are often stimulated by the hope of promotion
to improve the education they already possess.
This is the experience of every nation that has
tried the compulsory service system. At the
back of all straight-out local opposition to uni-
versalservice, and behind alltheexpedients to block
anything effective in that line, is, of course, the
typically Anglo-Saxon and fatuous view that
there is no real danger; that we shall muddle
through all right in the end ; and that hence it is
unnecessary to worry. It is impossible to sup-
pose that General Gordon believes in his heart
that Australia is going to create any real defence
by training children of 14 and upwards
in the art of war —though courtesy to the
politicians who control his billet may compel
a certain unwilling acquiescence with their plans.
It is improbable even that Joe Cook, who would
be employed lay-preaching at a Parramatta
street corner if he weren’t Australian Minister for
Defence, considers that this is the soundest way
to ensure the Commonwealth froqadisaster. Simply
Gordon and Cook, like many another, decline to
believe that disaster is conceivable. Yet a few
months back. Admiral Poore, who sees a con-
siderable amount of the world in the course of his
profession, gave Australia a limit of five years in
which to prepare for trouble. It is a tragic thing,
in the circumstances, that incompetent politicians
should continue to blither about an army of small
boys as a main stand-by for the nation, and more
tragic that a responsible soldier should be found
hex - e and there to support and abet such a pro-
posal.

Soup, the Consoler.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The workers of Geelong, the Slack City of Victoria, are
suffering- through lack of employment. Soup kitchens
have been kept going during the winter as an alleviative
measure. —Information disseminated by Melbourne’s Con-
servative press.
Oh, the chops grow thick on the plains around,
and the blankets are there in droves,
While the butter and cheese in the clover roam
and the beef in the green-stuff roves ;
There’s trouble enough in the slow old town —
there’s suffering and to spare,
But the tucker is plenteous on the plains where
the trespasser must beware.
The trespasser must beware, of course. As it was
in the days of yore,
The man on the perish gets little or less, and the
squatter gets rather more ;
The man with the land is a king, all right, and he
ruffles it, right or wrong ;
But they’re running the rabbit with jugs (for
soup !) in the alleys of old Geelong.
Yes, old Geelong’s in a parlous state, with the
wolf at the worker’s door,
And never a fat, roast sheep inside ; the bed’s on
the naked floor,
The furniture’s down at the auction-rooms, and
the clock is up the spout,
But the king o’ the rolling plains gets three square
meals a day, no doubt !
Three meals a day for the full-fleshed boss, and
something at bed-time, too ;
Though the worker of old Geelong goes off to his
slumbers, afraid and blue,
And the kids support with a pint of soup faint
spirit and fainter flesh,
And his missus can see in her dreams of Heaven
good red meat, corned and fresh.
01), corned or fresh,it’s all the same to the starvers
of old Geelong;
The sheep are fat on the plains around, but the
mutton-demand is strong,
And the worker is hollow enough, God wot, though
the charity toilers stoop
To keep his body in fighting trim, and to save his
soul with soup.

Two clever articles in the August Lone
Hand show that the best brains of Australia are
busy over the Defence problem. And quickened
by judicious applications of D.C.L., the whisky of
the wise, they must reduce that problem to one
word—population. Add the word land, and you
have the necessary magic for conjuring the country
into prosperity and safety. Progress laughs
itself into prosperity at the merry twinkle from
the amber eye of the scholarly brand.*
than about getting married. But now Common-
wealth Statist Knibbs has dug out similar figures
for all his dominions, excepting Tasmania; and
on the whole the other States, taking them in the
lump, can’t afford to shake a stick at N. S. Wales.
A calm survey of Knibbs’ long array of figures is
positively startling. Leaving out Tasmania,
25,708 firstborns arrived in Australia last year;
and no less than 8691 of them reached the Com-
monwealth anything from nine months to one
month ahead of schedule time. There were 2859
others who arrived a month or less ahead of the
schedule ; but some of them may be given the
benefit of the doubt. Excluding all these last
there still remain 34 out of every 100—and that’s
a proportion big enough to make Australia think
hard. And the chances are that the story is, in at
least one respect, worse than that. Thus of the
25,708 mothers of first-born children, 4050 were 30
years old or over ; and if they were left out of the
reckoning it looks highly probable that the 34
would rush up to 40 or thereabouts so far as the
younger brides are concerned. Just what is the
cause of it all this paper doesn’t know for cer-
tain ; most likely there isn’t merely one cause,
but a dozen. It may be that Australia doesn’t pay
the young man the wages that he ought to get; it
may be that the young woman isn’t content to start
on the housekeeping business on the modest basis
that she ought to be content with for a begin-
ning ; it may be that the imported mother, or
the home-grown mother of the first generation,
doesn’t realise that the truer type of Australian
girl rushes into womanhood at tremendous speed,
and therefore postpones giving the girl a few
valuable hints until there isn’t much left for
mother to give hints about. There are, no
doubt, a dozen more reasons, good and
had. But at any rate the figures stand.
And even they don’t show the blackest side
of the picture. The social “respectability”
of these mothers is saved. They have roped in
their husbands. But there must be hundreds who
can’t; and their infants appear in two other lists.
One needn’t be referred to; the other is to be
found in the records of the coroners’ courts —the
appalling records of the infants (unknown many of
them) who have been done to death. In these
cases the mother hasn’t been able to save her
name by legally getting another, so she struggles
after much the same thing by getting rid of the
little impediment.

Some More About Moneylending.
This paper commented last week on a reading of
the Moneylenders and Infants Loans Act (1905),
which came as a shock and a surprise to the
members of the N.S. W. Bull Court when it was
brought to their notice in the form of what was
practically an application to summarily set aside
an unconscionable moneylending bargain. Since
it seemed reasonable to assume that what was new
in the legal line to the N.S.W. Bull Court was
likely also to be a novelty to the general public,
which isn’t paid a big salary to plough through the
mazes of the law, the matter was discussed
at some length. But it wasn’t exhausted by any
means. There is another aspect of this im-
ported and too-little-known Act which can
do with ventilation. How many people, one
wonders, appreciate that in N.S. W. all money-
lenders require to be registered? How many
lawyers, policemen, burglars, laymen and so
forth, understand that if folks who habitually lend
money for profit (apart, that is, from such as
bankers and solicitors and those traders—ware-
housemen, for example—who lend money to clients
as part of their businesses) omit to register them-
selves they are liable to heavy fine and long im-
prisonment ? Undoubtedly very few; and as a
result, the identical abuse which the original
British Act (of which ours is a copy) was
framed to scotch is rife in N.S. W. In
the West End of London a decade ago
eery third tailor, hotel-porter, haberdasher,
■ ot-maker, etc., was an amateur usurer.
These traders specialised mostly in accommodat-
ing the temporarily-broke, but normally more or
less gilded, youths of the nation—the sort who had
outrun their paternal allowances and wanted a bit
to go on with at any price. The poorer quarters
of the metropolis and the big provincial towns
contained another class of cash-provider on terms.
People in a small way of business, or in no way of
business, who had a little loose capital, let it be
known that they were open to help their indigent
brethren at a fair figure. To them flocked those
who badly needed ready coin but were too proud
to enter a pawnshop or other place where the
frankly impoverished foregather. And the
amount of extortion and wicked swindling that
went on was stupendous. There are not many
citizens of Sydney or any other big N.S. W town
but can call to mind an acquaintance or two or
three that is prepared to supply cash at a good
•stiff rate of interest outside his regular avenue of
toil, and despite the fact that he is not a pro-
fessional hirer out of gold. The thing is regarded
widely as a perfectly legitimate side-line to a score
of callings. The writer knows personally one
worthy church-member who considers that the
fact of his having on different occasions advanced
most of his fellow-worshippers cash at rates vary-
ing from 30 to 100 per cent, reflects credit on his
kindliness and good feeling. Nor are his church
acquaintances the only members of the community
whom he has thus benefited. Yet he would
fall in a swoon if it were suggested that
he should proceed to the Registrar-General’s
office and there cause himself to be inscribed as
a professional moneylender. Though he doesn’t
know it, he is certainly liable to a large
fine, and gaol as well. The same fact
applies to the numerous person in a big
office or warehouse or Government depart-
ment, who habitually “obliges” his fellow-
employees for a steep consideration, and, pro-
bably, to many of the time-payment fraternity.
The definition of the word “moneylender” in
the Act leaves it to the Court to say how many,
and what sort of transactions lift a man from the
class of beneficent fairy, so to speak, who is act-
ing the part of usurer merely to oblige a friend,
into that of the “ habitual ” who deliberately and
persistently holds himself out as one from whom
bullion may be had if his conditions are coinolied
with. It is quite safe to say, however, that
not many of those doing business in this line
at present would come within the former
category. The taste for moneylending resembles
the passion for beer, in that it grows on a man.
But those who are bitten by the former craze
cannot be too warmly urged to note that the wages
of unauthorised usury are likely to be even more
costly than those of beer, once debtors, the legal
authorities and others concerned start to realise
things.

N. S. Walks has a chance now to calmly consider
its own Stinking Fish habit of assuming that the
imported goods must necessarily be better than any
it could produce itself. Between them Car-
ruthers and the Sydney morning papers chased
Charles Oliver out of office as Chief Railway
Commissioner, and appointed Johnson, a man
whom none of them had ever heard of; but it was
enough for them that Johnson had had some sort
of job on an English railway, and wasn’t an
Australian. Johnson naturally read the Sydney
morning papers, and took their word for it that
the Australian was a poor person who wasn’t even
worth consulting. Consequently, when New-
castle wanted more coal-shipping facilities, John-
son absolutely disregarded the Advisory Com-
mittee appointed in connection with Newcastle
Harbor, though (in the absence of a Harbor
Trust) this committee had some sort of official
standing. As the only man who knew anything,
Johnson went ahead and ordered four MoMfXER
hoists at a cost of between £15,000 and £20,000
each ; and, in spite of protests, he absolutely cut
off 1600 ft. of useful wharf frontage in making
an approach to the only one of them which
has ever been taken out of its packing.
That one, however, was quite enough ; it smashed
the coal, and was otherwise so unsuitable and
disastrous that mine-owners at last refused to
jeopardise their market by loading any
vessels drawn up alongside it. The row
was so great that the Government ap-
pointed a Commission to practically sit on
Johnson as a jury, and the verdict has just
been announced. Such a howling failure is the
whole business that the Commission “feels
compelled to make the drastic recommenda-
tion,” not merely that the three hoists
should remain in their packings, but
that the one already erected should be
torn down and removed. So far as
Johnson’s wild experiment has gone,
the cost to the State has been £68,071;
and probably the State will be able
to get for the whole outfit about as
much as it will cost to shift the im-
pediment which Johnson raised. It is
a lot of money for a small State to pay for
the joy of importing Johnson ; but as the
Stinking Fish dailies were largely respon-
sible for deceiving the poor man, no doubt
they will open another Dreadnought list to make
good at least some of the consequences of their
folly.

That sturdy Anti-Socialist, the farmer, has done
so well out of Socialism that his neighbor, the
country storekeeper, is also reaching out for a
portion of the benevolent Curse as an antidote for
too much Private Enterprise ; and the indications
are that his anger will be terrible if he is prevented
from clutching it. The circumstances of the case
are so bright and glaring, and they show up
the hoofs and tail of Anti-Sosh in such a
beautiful light, that plain black ink and white
paper cannot do them justice; they deserve a
page to themselves arranged like an illuminated
address. In the first place he it known that,
owing to the high price demanded for its sugar by
the great Private Enterprise co., the N.S.W.
town grocer and the country storekeeper have for
years past sold the sweet substance at practically
cost price. On sugar they have hitherto given
their labor, profanity,- shop-space, etc., for
nothing, and have recouped themselves by making
a little more profit on other goods in which the
great sugar co. has no interest. The town grocer
has borne up under the infliction simply because
he had to sell sugar for the convenience of his cus-
tomers and because there was no remedy in sight.
His country relative, however, after numerous
profitless years, thinks he sees a way out of the
difficulty. He has descended on the imported
Railway Johnson with the perfectly staggering
request that he (Johnson) shall lower the carriage
rates on sugar so as to enable him (the country
storekeeper) to make a profit ! The Commission-
er asserts that the reduction asked-' for would
entail a loss of £lO.OOO to the department of
Johnson ; yet, in spite of that awful fact, the
storekeeper is waiting on Johnson’s doormat with
the pathetic expression of the helpless person who
wants to know what is going to be done for him.
The town grocer, meanwhile, remains carefully
at home ; his sugar is not brought to his door
by a Socialistic railway, and he isn’t going to
waste time endeavoring to induce a Private Enter-
prise firm of carriers to cart it to him at a
dead loss. Even the Sydney Telegraph
recognises that the storekeeper’s demand is too
terrible, and it is hustling him off the premises
with some muffled advice to go and see the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. about it. Amongst
other things it points out to the storekeeper that,
even if the taxpayer made him a present of the
£lO,OOO a year, the bloated co. would probably put
up its rates to correspond, and mop up every
penny of the State subsidy. The Telegraph’s
own remedy for the trouble is a little more Free-
trade ; but it would prescribe the same way for a
broken leg. The otdy ailment Freetrade has ever
been known to cure is that mysterious one de-

“The King of Cadonia,” which arrived at
Her Majesty’s (Sydney) on Saturday night,
deserves a cheering word, in that it is largely a
new thing in the musical comedy line. It possesses
a distinct plot. The action is laid in a region
unexploited, hitherto, by those who keep the wolf
from the door by the manufacture of such
pieces. A good deal of the music is strangely
unreminiscent of other music in other enter-
tainments. The jests are mostly fresh, and
where they aren’t they give evidence of having
been carefully selected and edited and renovated
so that they appear almost as good as new. And
several of the leading performers—besides being
sound artists—are unknowns so far as Sydney
is concerned, and hence acceptable to theatre-
goers aweary of old faces and familiar methods.
Furthermore, the show is exquisitely dressed and
skilfully stage-managed, so that it presents a
series of most attractive pictures.
“THE KING OF CADPONIA," SYDNEY
HER MAJESTY’S.
Lo. Danse des Apaches by BERT GILBERT
and LOTTIE SARGENT.
Herbert Clayton, the co.’s main baritone,
is Kins of one of those uncharted lands wherein
regicide is supposed to be as popular as alcohol,
and more prevalent. Rumor credits his job
with danger at the hands of an anti-King League.
The League corresponds, in the estimation of the
Cadonian royal family, to the local Tiger, Sosh,
and keeps the Palace and
environs in a chronic fer-
ment. Whatever occurs of
an unpleasant nature is
ascribed to the League. If
the household cat passes
over in strong convulsions,
an indictment is filed
against the League, and it
is unanimously found guilty
of compassing the animal’s
taking-off. Should the cook
give notice or impudence,
the disconcerting fact is put
down to the blighting class-
distinction-destroying influ-
ence of the League. Some-
one of position files his sche-
dule. The calamity is ex-
plained by the fact that the
mad tactics of the League
have forced the insolvent
reluctantly to send all his
capital out of the coun-
try. In brief,League ”is
Cadonian for “ Caucus.”
Things reach such a pass
at last, and the Palace is
growing so jumpy and de-
moralised with apprehen-
sion, that the King is driven
to conceal himself behind a
clean shave, and make per-
sonal investigation of the
Monstei’. He becomes a
member of the allegedly anarchistic body. In
the course of his duties as Leaguer he meets,
loves, and is loved by Princess Marie. Mean-
while Bert Gilbert is holding the marrow-freezing
job of Regent, with the ghastly prospect adjacent
of being crowned King unless the vanished
sovereign reappears. To appreciate the horror of
Gilbert’s position it is necessary to realise that his
faith in the criminal intentions of the Leaguers is
as profound as that is of a female Conferencer in
regard to the reality of the Sosh Menace. In
Gilbert’s view, there is nothing of which the
League is incapable. He would leave his native
land for ever ; but he fears lest the League may
intercept and despoil him on the way. He lives for
the most partin his pyjamas on a roof—to escape
the Leaguers. Things end satisfactorily by the
discovery on the part of the King that the League
scare is all a piece of foolishness, fomented,
as far as can be gathered, for political purposes
by the managing General Bonski. So the King
marries Princess Marie, and Gilbert dresses and
hurries down from the roof, and everyone is
immensely relieved
* * • *
Herbert Clayton is about the most im-
pressive-looking king the writer has yet encoun-
tered. He has a fine, resonant voice, and his act-
ing is far above the average monarch’s efforts in
that line. He provides a curious instance of
the effect of face-herbage on personality’. With
his beard on he is wooden and- stiff.
Reaped, he becomes immediately laughing, boy-
ish and debonair, all that is sprightly and
attractive. Miss Dorothy Court, who plays Prin-
The New Beauty
Actor CLAYTON.
cess Marie, owns an excellent light soprano
voice, and she acts with quiet distinction
in a part necessarily restrained and dig-
nified. Bert Gilbert carries on his shoul-
ders practically the entire comedy of the
show, and gives the utmost satisfaction. Miss
Lottie Sargent is bright and taking in a sou-
brette part. Her “Danse des Apaches” with
Gilbert in the second act is the hit of the piece.
Miss Susie Vaughan, Arthur Appleby, Pat
Bathurst and Victor Prince play minor parts
well.
* * * *
At this theatre, on Saturday afternoon
next, a mixed show will be presented. The Syd-
ney Comedy Club intends to play “When We
Were Twenty-One,” and afterwards some of the
haughtiest members of N.S.W.’s old noblesse will
appear for the first time on any stage in tableaux.
These things are being done in the name of
Charity, and the Civil Ambulance and Transport
Corps is the excellent institution which is to
benefit by them.

“ The Bondman ” still pervades Sydney
Royal, and the crowd continues to surge in with
the object of personally considering his miseries.
But aiack ! it is not to be for much longer. The
Bland ’Olt co. goes to Melbourne shortly for
a six weeks’ season, and then it will dis-
band. Bland has found it increasingly hard of
late to get theatres wherein to produce his
marrow-coolers. An air of gloom broods over the
whole combination, from the normally-eheery
head and front of it down to the cow whose milk-
ing turn occurs in the farmyard scene,

Mrs. Melba embarked on another farewell
concert as this paper went to press. Albeit,
writing a while before the event, it is safer
than backing favorites to state that Sydney Town
Hall was packed with a distinguished and
appreciative audience; that the Jewel Song
from “Faust” induced rapturous applause;
that the Mad Scene from “ Lucia ” was
responsible for a furore of enthusiasm, and that
at the conclusion of the Inflammatus (“Stabat
Mater”) an encore number was vociferously
demanded. Also that no critics burst with
admiration, though several of them felt dashed
like it.
** * *
The free list continues to be entirely sus-
pended at Sydney Criterion, which is to say the
panto, is drawing well. The suspension of a
panto, free list indicates as surely that the public
cash is flowing into the box-office as the absence
of any mention of Dreadnoughts by our great
dailies does that the public cash is not flowing
into the Mayor’s office.

The sale of the late artist Brunton’s pic-
tures began with a fair prospect that none will
be left on the walls of the amateur auction mart.
All the theatrical managers and several incorri-
gible first-nighters secured one or more apiece,
and the sale is to continue during the current
week.

A new songstress who may break into
melody in Sydney within the next few weeks is
Miss Lucelle Benstead. At present she is just
young enough to make it unsafe to prophesy what
she may become, but there are authorities who
reckon she will go far. If she should arrive she
will be the first nightingale that her State has
turned out, for she is a daughter of the far interior
as well as of her parents ; her birthplace was Alice
Springs, in the southern part of the Territory and
almost in the exact centre of Australia. The
singer’s father and mother were station-owners at
Alice Springs in the ’Bo’s and ’9o’s of last century.
“ I spent six years there,” says Mrs. Benstead ;
“they were the happiest years of my life, and the
place is a Paradise.’’ Possibly these weren’t
drought years—still the remark sounds well.

Sydney Tivoli was darkened last Saturday
by the arrival of Charles J. Johnson, cake-
walker, who is alleged to be a cousin of that
other Johnson who danced in a hempen square at
the Stadium some time last year. Dancing,
apparently, is an incurable habit of the Johnson
family. Charles J. is billed as the champion of
the world in his own particular line, and he is
certainly an elegant, light-footed person ; but it is
not a particularly large stunt to travel the earth
on. The man who came from Paris to play
Diabolo is the Tivoli record in the way of the
long distance and the short stunt. Blake and
Granby supply the other new turn of the pro-
gramme, which consists of a crockery-breaking
sketch. It exhilarates, but isn’t particularly
amusing. The Kremka Brothers and Rosina
Casselli’s midget dogs are first-rank performers.
The dogs are now barking their farewells, and
they will sport their jewelled collars and drive
their motor-car for the last time on Thursday
night (26th). The dancing of the Two Prices and
the patter of Vaude and Verne deserve a word of
approbation, and the fishing village of the First-
Part continues to be an astonishing spectacle.

Adelaide Royal is for the moment a one-
man show. The Comic Operas have finished up
with a week of “Dairymaids” and “Gotten-
berg,” and made way for Foster Fraser—just off
the mail-boat. His lectures vary from scenes of
massacre in Russia to comic incidents in the
House of Commons. Meanwhile, politicians and
other people vie in driving him round and filling
him up with information for the book on Australia
which is bound to follow. Cinquevalli is put-
ting in his final week in this country at the Tivoli,
and R. H. Douglass has come in to monologue in
his support. The University Conservatorium has
broken out with a revival of romantic drama,
mostly Irish ; and the literary section of the com-
munity welcomes a chance of making acquaintance
with W. B. Yeats and Synge. Anything more
essentially dramatic could hardly be devised than
t'ne quiet game of chess played by Deirdre and her
young king while the executioner waits on the
threshold. These things might not pay commer-
cially, but they are a true artistic success.
Bryceson Trehearne fathers the movement, and
composes the incidental music, and has got round
him an unexpected wealth of amateur talent.

“ Othello ” has come to pass at Melbourne
Royal, and many immortal lines are revealing
their origin to a public that knew them only as

quotations torn from their context. After going
20 years without a revival of “ Othello,” the city
wanted it hadly for educational purposes. Out of
every 20 sententious citizens who profess to give
a “round unvarnished tale” of a commercial
occurrence, in which they “nothing extenuate
nor set down aught in malice,” there is not more
than one, on an average, who can locate the exact
whereabouts of those little hits of literature. To
all such stereotyped expressionists The Bul-
letin would say: “Put money in thy purse
and buy a ticket for the show aforesaid. Go and
batten on this Moor. Othello has the medicine
that physics ignorance.”
* * * *
Besides, the play of “Othello” contains
more human interest to the square yard of text
than any other work of Shakspeare. It is good,
meaty melodrama all the time. One may go home
and dream of horrors after it. Indeed the man
who has been applying to his blood the hot,
rebellious liquor which rnaketh thirsty where
it most doth satisfy, is in danger of finding green-
eyed monsters seated on the counterpane when
he retires to rest after seeing how the dusky
warrior did Desdemona’s quietus make. Perhaps
the terrible fifth act is the more impressive for
being shorn of some of its old attractions. The
introductory scene is omitted where Roderigo is
wounded by Cassio, and finally killed by lago.
The curtain rises on the bedroom scene, so the
audience hears nothing of Roderigo’s death until
Emilia brings the new§ to Othello. The injury to
Cassio’s hind leg, inflicted by lago, is practically
suppressed in this version, and the assassination
of Emilia by her husband is sickbed o’er by a pale
cast of doubt. Emilia doesn’t die in a bold Shak-
spearian manner. She merely subsides into a
high-backed chair with her figure turned from
observation, and whether she lives or dies
is a matter of no concern to her friends, seemingly.
These cuttings and alterations in the fifth act are
less remarked than the omission of the two open-
ing scenes in the first act. The performance
begins in the council chamber, and the audience
hears nothing of Desdemona’s elopement until her
infuriated parent comes along with his complaint.
* * » *
Although Othello is one of the “fattest”
characters an actor can wish for, the character of
lago is apt to take a lot of the shine out of him.
I hey are striking individuals of almost equal
weight, and lago piles up a lot of points ere his
rival gets fairly going. Also he is in a posi-
tion to put in a lot of fine work after the
noble savage has started to roar. The actor
who can play Othello without being somewhat
overshadowed by the villain of the piece should
be capable of completely overshadowing the other
actor if they were to change places. With Oscar
Asche and Herbert Grim wood, in the present pro-
duction there is no question of a divided
sovereignty. Asche, in the name part, so domi-
nates Grimwood that there seems something
wanting in the play. The audience cannot get a
proper sense of the relative proportions of the
characters. Why should Othello, or even Cassio
and foolish Roderigo, be so easily persuaded by
an lago in whom there is no personal magnetism ?
Herbert Grimwood (he was excellent as the
father of Katharine in “ Taming of the Shrew”)
is a small man. He has a curious, mincing man-
ner of speech that would awaken suspicion rather
than confidence in the people he wants to impose
upon. It is not unlike the manner of a young
Hebrew who has some diamonds to dispose of.
lago is not bound to be a bluff, rough, jolly vil-
lain, but. he should be a very likeable fellow.
Everybody calls him “honest lago.” Dis-
simulation must come natural to him. But
the actor in this case draws an lago
of the modern conventional kind, whose evil de-
signs are conspicuously obvious. The performance
is lacking equally in strength and subtlety. Oscar
Asche, on the other hand, is exceptionally power-
ful in everything except two or three of the
declamatory speeches, which every actor rants.
Ascbe’s Othello, in a frenzy of jealousy, is
great but not gigantic. His falling in a fit
of epilepsy seems natural evidence of weak-
ness, whereas there have been Othellos whose
epilepsy merely emphasised the strength of
their passion. They had to have a fit or burst.
It is in his speech to the Senate, his tender
moments with Desdemona, his masterful appear-
ance in the courtyard when he dismisses Cassio,
and in his melancholy murderousness and final
despair in the bedroom scene, that Oscar Asche is
at his best. His dualogues with lago are fine in
places, and his make-up is convincing. The
colored alien is a very real person. There is even
a touch of the tar brush in his deportment and his
voice.
* * •* *
Miss Lily Bray ton, in appearance, hardly
realises one’s idea of meek and gentle Desdemona.
The defiant glare of Katharine the Shrew still
lingers in her eyes. But her performance is pretty
and pathetic. Miss Robertson, as Emilia, is as
effective as her moderately strong voice will allow
her to be. Gerald Souper is a rather heavy but
very capable Cassio in his drunken scene, and the
men in smaller parts are either good, or better.
“Othello ” will be played all this week, and next
it will take alternate nights with “The Taming
of the Shrew.”
** * *
Some night, a few years hence, the Mel-
bourne Town Hall may be again crowded with an
expectant audience, waiting to hear whether the
voice of Amy Castles is as good as its latest
European reputation. Last Saturday night was
Melbourne’s third time of waiting. The first
audience of 10 years ago heard a glorious voice—
the voice of a young girl who did not know what
platform affectations meant. The second advent
was passable, and it passed. It may now be
packed away with the forgotten bygones. The
latest edition of Amy is a self-possessed young
woman ; placid, unemotional, but still pleasing in
her naturalness. There is evidence of very
thorough training of what is obviously a
rare voice. Opening with a recitative and
aria from Meyerbeer’s “La Stella del Nord,”
the singer expressed the light, shade and strength
of the music with all the ease of a great artist.
There was a double flute obligato, and in conjunc-
tion with the two instruments the remarkable
flexibility of the voice was displayed at the full
strength of its purity. An aria from Giordano’s
“ Andrea Chenier,” an intricate but superb com-
position, was also sung with consummate ease ;
but—the pity of it ! —without the slightest
emotional expression. An encore, a simple song
of a child and broken toys, failed to convey
its possibilities in the direction of quaint
expression. Two English songs, however, scored
heavily, and in the final encore—there were
encores galore—Miss Castles struck her only
emotional note in a fine rendering of the inevitable
“Home, Sweet Home.” The dominant impression
of the artist—advertised by an enterprising man-
agement as “The Australian Jenny Lind is
that she is good enough to be Amy Castles without
dragging in the name of any deceased Swede. It
is a superb natural voice, and the owner, in spite
of her placid temperament, is fully equal to sing-
ing the most involved of soprano compositions.
But, by the shades of Jenny Lind, is there no one
able to arouse her into emotional expression of
dramatic strength ?
* * * *
Of the company which supports Amy, the
first mem her to make Saturday’s crowded audience
sit up and listen was Anderson Nicol, a dark-haired
tenor, well up to the fleshy standard of his class.
He could easily pass muster if the Taits were to
bill him as Signor Angelotti Nicolini. A good
start was made with “Celeste Aida,” which prob-
ably has not been beard in Melbourne since
Larizza sang in Verdi’s opera. As an encore.
Nicol(ini) sang “Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes,”
with a richness of voice that has not
often been surpassed in Melbourne, though
the singer hardly suggested a blithe and gay
young gondolier in a Gilbert and Sullivan
opera. Adrian Amadio, a youth who has come
into local prominence as a master of the instru-
ment with which the late It. Swiveller used to
gain consolacion, was not the least prominent
feature of an excellent concert programme. The
youthful flautist, in addition to rendering three or
four solo pieces, was in strong evidence with his
admiring father in the double flute obligato to the
Meyerbeer aria. The piano soloist is Mr. Victor
Biisst (with two dots over the “ u”), and another
lady-like pianist, Mr. Harold Elvens, made no
mistakes as the accompanist. A very big gun,
Peter Dawson, was named on the programme to
sing “The Mad Dog” and other songs, but the
real mad dog was in the manager’s room. There
a telegram was received from the little man with
the big voice, who explained that floods and
broken bridges had blocked the Adelaide express.
Peter’s part (a good name is Peter) was taken by
a young Melbourne baritone, W. E. Lewis, who
would have fully satisfied the audience had he only
forgotten to be so unnecessarily nervous.
** * *
At Her Majesty’s (Melbourne) the
Williamson Dramatic Co. will be engaged until
Friday with “The Flag Lieutenant,” which, in the
advertised words of the local Aegus, “swings
the breath of the ocean over the footlights.” But
on Saturday the flagship of Admiral Titheradge
will steam round to the Princess’s, and the gay
Lieutenant and his companions will swing their
oz.onic cough over the footlights of the theatre in
Spring-street. Her Majesty’s is wanted for the
Comic Opera Co., which is returning for its
annual season. It opens its joyful proceedings
with “ The Duchess of Dantzic,” which gorgeous
work is new to Melbourne.
* * *
Hugh Ward and co. are passing away from
the Princess’s in the same old cloud of farcical
complications that bore them to the premises six
weeks ago. “The Fencing Master” has given
place to “ A Bachelor’s Honeymoon,” and the co.
will make its adieux in that revived frivolity.
Then, as was afore stated. “The Flag Lieutenant”
will sprinkle salt sea spray on the big drum, and
the odor of the mighty deep will be loud in the
stalls.
** * #
More in sorrow than in gladness this paper
notes the fact that Melbourne no longer thrills
responsively to “The Face at the Window.”
Business is not up to its usual mark at the King’s
since “ The Face ” re-appeared. When the lights
go dim and low, and a wailing cry, like unto a bad
toothache, announces the coming of the Gruesome
Visage, the audience that shuddered of yore is
now content to titter. Even the gal vanised corpse
is hailed with faint demonstrations of mirth. But
on Saturday the Andersonians will turn their
attention seriously to the new Australian drama
by Jo Smith. The title of Jo Smith’s story is
“The Bushwoman,” and its interest is rural and
domestic. In short, a play of Australian up-
country life with no bushrangers in it.
* * * *■
At the Athenaeum Hall (Melbourne),
where Taits’pictures are boarding for the present,
the programme is the usual procession of the
tragic, the tickling and the tidy. A mailman’s
devotion to duty ends in his death, which occurs
with the satisfactory support of an angel
and a mob of kneeling cowboys. An in-
teresting and dazzling fable is “The Hotel
Thief,” which provides details of a burglary.
Foolshead, an intense Italian humorist, this time
becomes a sportsman, with more or less mirthless
results; while “Drunkards’ Fancies” is one of
the strongest temperance arguments this paper
has ever beheld. But the monarch of the menu
on Saturday was a brilliant and skilfully-tinted
picture of Colombo, described in the classic tongue
of ’Erb and Benno as “a perfect boshter of a
place.”
** * *
West’s films at Melbourne Olympia on
Saturday included a couple of French storyettes,
told with characteristic vivacity. The first. “Jim
and Willie,” is a study of a man hunt, conducted
by ladies whose curious slenderness suggests that
they belong to some odd breed of waterfowl. “ A
Street Waif ” is a tale of the rescue of a dishevelled
maiden. Anotherrestfulnarrative, “AFalseOath,”
is seemingly one of those matrimonial wrong-
angled triangles, where a blameless hypothenuse
bares the capers of the other two sides. There is
a further picture of Edward of England in the
middle of grovelling minions. The days and
nights of West’s pictures at Olympia are num-
bered. Early next month—the 9th, or there-
abouts—the new West’s building will be ready to
receive visitors, and the pictures will there come
to light under the most up-to-date conditions as
regards seating accommodation.

A benefit to Albert Norman, whose career
as a character actor —and a clever, forcible actor
at that—has been cut shore by ill-health, will take
place at the King’s Theatre on Monday, Septem-
ber 6. Mr. Apderson lends the theatre to the
good cause, all the leading managers and mum-
mers in Melbourne have volunteered their assist-
ance, and the patronage of many personages of
importance has been promised to the big enter-
tainment that is fixed up for the occasion. Phil
Goatcher and Joseph Daniels are the honorary
organising secretaries of the Norman benefit. A
cheque addressed to either of them at the King’s
Theatre or the Green .Room Club, will be duly
acknowledged with its equivalent in tickets for
the show.

Foster Fraser, the travelled journalist
who talks so brightly of his experiences and illus-
trates his monologue with dramatic pictures on
the screen, comes due in Melbourne from Adelaide
next Monday (30th) at the Masonic Hall. Fraser
gives six lecture entertainments in all. The first
is “ America Up to Date,” and the one specially
designed to attract womankind to a matinee on
Wednesday is “The Women of Many Lands.”

The Melbourne Opera House programme
is losing Chung Ling Soo from its midst after to-
night (Thursday). The vacuum left by the retiring
wizard will be tilled by Rosina Casselli’s perform-
ing dogs, to the best of their ability. Florence
and Lillian, likewise the Bells, are staying on
awhile longer, and the- rest of the proceedings
includes the reappearance of Guest and Newlyn,
whose sad discourse is not fully atoned for by their
dancing.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“E.D. ”: It would be interesting to know on what
grounds the theatrical manager of great experience, who
is supposed to have developed remarkable sagacity in
giving the people what they want, selected “The Flag
Lieutenant ” as the sort of play Australia pants for.
What peculiar elements satisfied him that this particular
melo-comedy wduld take well and give pleasure to all?
I can see good points in the play, but where are the
likely appeals to the favor of Thomas, Richard, and
Henry? I ask this even in face of the dim possibility of
“The Flag Lieutenant” booming like thunder while I
write. It seems to me that the play’s weak—utterly help-
less—ending is sufficient to damn it on sight with any
stage-manager of parts and experience, since it is amply
demonstrated that the public hates an indefinite finish.
Could a conclusion be more inconclusive? The authors
create an interesting problem, and then bolt in absolute
terror from their psychological Frankenstein. Ibsen
would have started “The Flag Lieutenant” just where
its authors have ended it, and intelligent people, however
they may quarrel over the morals and meanings of the
shaggy Norwegian, admit that he is a master craftsman
in the making of plays. The Major is set up in life,
covered with honors and adulation for a deed of heroism
performed by the Lieutenant, who is scorned and con-
temned, and cannot explain. It’s a pity to throw such
fine possibilities into the dust box just when the pro-
blem is beginning to prob., in a manner of speaking.
“S.S.” : The Hugh Ward co. is composed practically of
comic opera graduates. For many years Hugh himself
earned a humble crust by flirting a nimble toe and lifting
up a somewhat gritty voice in frivolous musical plays.
Rose Musgrove left comic opera for genteel comedy;
Celia Ghiloni has hitherto been known as a successful
interpreter of Gilbert’s elderly contralti and a portly
romp in more bouffe-headed burlesque ; and Miss Grace
Palotta was a Gaiety Girl.
The cry of the stage super is still loud in Melbourne,
and he adduces some odd stories to. support his noise.
One is to the effect that Her Majesty’s Theatre in the
Yarra city applied for the services of a dozen members of
the naval forces to act as Supers-presumably in “The
Flag Lieutenant.” The remuneration offered was the
fabulous sum of 2s. fid. a night without any discount for
cash, and it was said that the naval men’s acceptance of
the offer would have the effect of depriving legitimate
supers of a job. The legitimate supers seem to harbor
the belief that they are capable of impersonating naval
forces. Alas ! it is a mistaken belief. The average super
can impersonate nobody but himself. Even for doing
that, however, ss. a night ■wouldn’t be too much.
One of the “suffragettes” who achieved some bold
advertisement in the British press by chaining herself to
the grating of the ladies’ gallery in the House of Com-
mons, so that she couldn’t easily be chucked out when she
made a disturbance, turns out to be an Australian.
Beaumont Smith has engaged her for an Australian
lecturing tour. The lady’s name, by the way, is Muriel
Matters. One would think it might be better for Muriel
to stay in England and keep chaining herself to the House
of Commons. She can gain little by tying herself to
public buildings here. Our women have the suffrage
already.
Randolph Bedford : First saw Oscar Asche in Beerbohm
Tree’s production of “ Ulysses.” Asche played Antinous,
and cut a wider swathe that did Tree, if only by reason of
his physical superiority. L*ter I saw him play Benedick
in “Much Ado,” at the Imperial Theatre—a pretty little
building made of marbles like Gorgonzola cheese. Ellen
Terry was the Beatrice, and nearly all the charm of the
show was hers ; yet, for all the charm, “ Much Ado” was
mostly played to the chairs. Later, at the Adelphi, Asche
did “ The Shrew.” I like the Melbourne production more
than that of the Adelphi. The scenery is worth the
money. There’s an atmosphere that isn’t English—the
atmosphere of Italy—the feeling of a big bulging violet
night blackened by cypress and stone pine ; of a century-
old rose climbing a five-hundred-year-old ruin ; the sense
of the belief that fireflies must be there low on the ground
among the myrtles. It brought Italy back to me again.
As for that street in Padua, there isn’t a shadow wrong.
“Zany”: Wellington (M.L.) recently suffered a mild
epidemic of Tahmmy Burns. The big-little stousher
didn’t catch on, and only showed for two nights at the
Opera House—to half a decent-sized audience both times.
It was a good moving-picture show; but the Tahmmy
Burns part of the programme was quite shocking.
Tahmmy, after a few wallops at the punching-ball, began
to puff like a motor-car with the croup, and he got tired
almost before he started. Then he danced round for a
few moments with his sparring partners, and after that
put on his Napoleonic overcoat again. Wellington believes
that he is disgracefully out of form, and his talk of being
never fitter in his life is just Tahmmy Burns.
There has been a death in the Sydney Cri. pony family.
“Cinders,” perhaps the shapeliest of the four-in-hand
which nightly supplied the traction-power for the panto,
heroine’s ball-chariot, is dust. A motor ran into him the
other night, and he sped to the pastures of Elysium.
“ S.S.” : An exasperating piece of foolishness in “ The
Flag Lieutenant” escapes attention. Lieutenant King-
ston and the doctor put up their whole scheme to foist
the glory of the former’s heroism on to Major Cyril
McKay. Yet the latter is seated a few feet from them,
listening to their conversation, and the fact that he
understands is manifested by his exulting cry, “ Men-
tioned in despatches ! I’m mentioned in despatches ! ”
This occurs after the major has recovered consciousness
and when his think-machine is in proper working order
again, and it makes the show look a trifle foolish.
“O.K. ” : Talking of the merry “Twelfth Night,” in
which Atholwood, Edmund Gwenn, Miss Waldorf, and
the thin comedian who played Andrew Aguecheek were
conspicuously good, E. I), remarks that May Chevalier,
who made a young and humorous Maria, was “ of small
consequence previously and since.” Marry come up !
Likewise Odds Bodikins and Grammercy ! Maj r Chevalier
was a bonnie actress of considerable consequence in all
she did. She gave a strangely interesting performance of
Miss Faulkner, the girl who captured the affections of
Sherlock Holmes. She was a charming sweetheart to
the Admirable Crichton what time he reigned on the
island, and her brief tfite A, tfite with that abnormal
butler after he had resumed buttling for her noble family
was full of subtle meaning. Nor should it ever be said
that May Chevalier was “ inconsiderable ” as the heroine
of “If I Were King.” Would that all the actresses im-
ported to Australia were qualified to hold a candle to her !
Seemingly she is among the favorites in the country she
came from and returned to, for last year I saw her billed
in London as appearing at a Kennington theatre (Ken-
nington where the cricket oval is) in “ Sherlock Holmes.”
Her husband, Hamilton Stewart, was running the show.
Melbourne’s new centre of attractions, south of the
Yarra, which originated years ago in FitzGerald Bros.’
circus-building and was finally established by the ill-fated
Prince’s Court, is about to spread itself considerably.
TheFitzGerald structure of galvanised iron was demolished
to make room for Olympia, built by the Wirths for circus
purposes, hut evidences of Prince’s Court are still in
existence. The water-chute and sundry side-shows will
hold their ground during the next summer season, any-
how ; and now Wirths are going to open a big roller-
skating rink close to Olympia and the Chute. This great
boss rink is to have a floor of reinforced concrete,
measuring 300ft. x 100ft. A sliding roof and sliding
sides to the structure will make it very airy in hot
weather, and the further end of it. consisting of two huge
doors, will open to another rink laid out as a garden.
The floor will be ready for business on August 28, a month
or so previous to the closing of the ice-skating season at
the adjacent Glaciarium. When the skaters quit-the Glassy
Harem, the building will be reconverted into the
home of Tait’s Pictures. Meanwhile, West’s Pictun s
(long- time identified with Olympia) will enter into posses-
sion of a home of their own, leaving Olympia to be utilised
once more for circus purposes. This forthcoming domi-
cile of West’s has the most commanding site in the whole
show market. Almost facing the Glaciarium, at the
junction of two streets, and right in the way of the
stream of humanity that flows southward from Melbourne,
the new building gives to the surrounding neighborhood
an air of show-place importance which formerly it lacked.
Is will be opened on 7th September, or thereabouts. The
theatre managements in the Bourke-street district are
bound to feel some twinges in the pocket when West’s
and the new rink and the circus and the Glaciarium
are all on the job. Their full power of attraction may
be estimated at not less than 12,000 on Saturday nights.
The Government of Groperland does its little besr,
seemingly, to discourage theatrical managers from send-
ing- costly shows to that district. There is a loss
of four days in conveying a company from Adelaide
and Perth, and when the co. arrives at Fremantle
there is an inhospitable impost of 4s. per ton on its lug-
gage, providing that it is put on the trucks for Perth :
otherwise it goes throug-h the Customs sheds, and theie
is an extra charge of fid. per ton. Once landed at Fre-
mantle the company’s tons of scenery and effects cannot
be shipped out of Westralia until another 3s. 9d. per ton
has been levied. Wm. Anderson’s representative in the
West, Michael Joseph, lately ventured to expostulate
with the Chief Secretary re these exorbitant ehargis.
and that political luminary referred him to the
local Harbor Trust Secretar}-, who practically up-
braided him for interloping. “Theatrical companies
are not asked to come here,” said the Harbor
Trust secretary, and in a brilliant afterthought he asked:
“ Why don’t you have the scenery made in Western Aus-
tralia 1 ” He might as well have asked why the touring-
managers didn’t get their plays written and their actors
manufactured in Perth. Another grievance that show-
men complain of is the bad construction of the two exist-
ing theatres in Perth, which exposes them to harassing
interference by the Central Board of Health. His
Worship the Mayor is the proprietor of the two theatres,
and although his tenants have to suffer for the short-
comings of his property, he himself has been able to
avoid compliance with the Board’s order to provide an
asbestos curtain at the Theatre Royal, which order was
served on him three years ago. The Mayor is truly
Perthian in his business policy. He reserves the right to
sell lollies, peanuts and cordials in his theatres, and
lately his daughter took over the cloakrooms.

At the end of “ The King- of Cadonia,” Mr. Bert Gilbert
and Miss Sargent brought down the house with the
larrikin valse of Paris, “La Danse des Apaches.” It
called for both the art of facial expression and the most
exact exhibition of simultaneous activity on the part of
booh the performers, and was so cleverly given that it is
likely to be the most talked of feature of the piece.—
Uighly-Moral Morning Daily.
Miss Sargent stepped aside from her “comedy busi-
ness” in the second act of “The King of Cadonia” to
join Mr. Gilbert in the ugly and repulsive “ Danse des
Apaches.” This brutal “dance,” which has nothing
whatever to do with the piece, should be cut out. —

Is it naughty ? Is it good ?
Should one go to it, or should
You and I, whose purity
Is above all question, flee
When our friends advise us to
Buy a seat and view it? Do
Lottie Sargent’s capers and
Those of Gilbert harm the Brand
Newly-snatched? . . . Blank ignorance
Clouds my brain anent this dance.
Is it smartly done or not?
Is it Art or blessed rot?
Does it call for cleverness
Poise, agility, address?
Or, upon the other hand,
Is it amateurish and
Likely, therefore, to inspire
Cultured folks with scorn and ire?. . . .
On these vital points my mind
Is an utter blank, I find.
Is it brutal, vulgar, crude—
All that’s horrible and rude?
Are the dancers’ hammerlocks
Clamant of the ’Loo and Rocks?
Is the whole performance one
The sesthetic type should shun ?
Phrases such as “ quite refined,”
“ Truly sweet,” “ instinct with mind ”
Say, may these be used of it ? . . .
I can’t judge myseif a bit.
Finally, resolve me this:—
Will it cause the public bliss?
Will they cheer at it and yell—
In a word, “ receive it well?”
Or will naught but snorts of rage
Greet the antics on the stage
Of Miss Sargent and her friend?
Weary days and nights I spend
Puzzling thus. . . . I’m all at sea
When my dailies disagree.

ON THE UP-GRADE.
ARISTOCRATICUS : “ Who are your people descended
from then?”
BREWERYUS: “No one. We've ascended!”
The aldermanic hosts from the Sydney
suburban councils have decided to hold an anti-
Greater Sydney Conference of their own. This is
like the peers of England (with apologies to the
peers) meeting to discuss the abolition of the
House of Lords; or the hand weavers of the old
days meeting to discuss the inadvisableness of
having improved machinery on the ground that
the machines were the best possible and were
working very well as they were, and that Provi-
dence was against anything new. The aldermen
are also acting on the general principles of “Let
sleeping dogs lie,” “ Quieta non mover e” “Better
not,” “ Do not poke the animals,” “Don’t shoot
the pianist; he’s doing his blanky,” “Let well
alone.” “Keep off the grass,” “The time is not
ripe,” and many other maxims which, doubtless,
were whispered to the Creator on the first of the
six working days by the Devil. And when the
last trump sounds, and all the souls are about to
begin the Resurrection, an aldermanic ghost from
one of the suburbs of Sydney will be heard above
the blare of the trump protesting that the move-
ment is premature.
The Oldest Inhabitant discovers some
more venerable pubs :
Five hotels will disappear, at least for a time, amid the
great repairs in Oxford-street, Sydney. One is the
Burdekin, known in days gone by as the Blind Beggar.
The old house was kept by Alfred Bradford. The Ex-
change did not exist in the days of the Blind Beggar, but
where the London Bank now is was the Eagle, kept by Jas.
Lees, who is alive to day, and the sole survivor in Sydney
of the 11th Regiment. The Kelso is on the site of the old
Forester’s Arms, once kept by W. A. Thompson. • Tne
Crecy is on the site of the Sportsman’s Arms of half a cen-
tury ago. Where the Oxford is (corner of Bourke-
street), a pub called the Cottage of Content was
once kept by Edward Johnston. Perhaps, of the five,
one may be rebuilt. It is a pity that some of
these old pub-names weren’t preserved. The Blind
Beggar and the Cottage of Content and their kind sound
far more picturesque than most of the legends we see on
drink signboards to-day. When one considers that in
Sydney there are six pubs called Albert, three Captain
Cooks, six Commercials, four Crowns, eight Victorias,
11 Railways, and all manner of other duplications, one
ceases to wonder at the growth of Local Option.
“ F.C.” on some of the ways of the sea
As to the missing Waratah, I had my doubts when the
cables told us that four days after being overdue the
underwriters passed on their insurance at a cost of 45
per cent. ; and a few days later the price went up to 90
and 93 per cent, of the total risk. This is a case where
money talks. Afterwards, as if to explain that, talk,
a cable said that the vessel took in 2000 tons of coal at
Durban, of which 300 tons were on the bridge debk—
which may or may not be true. Now conies the skipper
of the Bannockburn, who left Capetown for Australia on
July 24, with a large quantity of coal on his main deck.
On July 26—the day the Waratah cleared from Durban—
he ran into the worst gale he ever remembers, which
“threw the steamer on her beam ends, and kept her
thereabouts until all the coal had been washed overboard. ”
Had that not happened, he doubts if his vessel
would have righted itself. Still I was posted
missing myself once, and I’m alive at time of writing.
In November, 1886, I was helping to drive an
ocean tramp with 3000 tons of cotton screwed
below her decks from Galveston (Texas) to Liverpool.
The greedy owners had filled the main bunkers with
cotton, and sent us orders to call at Norfolk (Virginia)for
enough coal to carry us across. We filled the side
bunkers and then planted 300 tons on the after deck,
carefully battened away from the wheel-chains and other
top-hamper. A gorgeous Atlantic gale started as soon as
we got outside, and about the middle of my watch she
began rolling so that I thought the engines would fall
over on fop of me. Presently the second engineer came
down, put the engines at half speed, and sent me, the
firemen and trimmers and every available soul on deck to
bear a hand. The deck coal had started rolling,
and had carried away the battens and hampered the
wheel chains. The after wheel was too stiff to work, and
the chains were stuck, anyhow ; so presently, with an
extra roll, the old tub got over on her side with the deck-
awash, and stayed there. It was a case of haste or Davy
Jones, so we put every scrap of that coal overboard in
record time. Then we had to nurse the remaining fuel
and call at the Azores for more, and as there is no”cable
thence, we were posted missing before we saw the
Queenstown lighthouse. That vessel was the St. Mungo,
of Glasgow, and she was afterwards wrecked on the
Canary Islands when taking railway-iron to Buenos
Ayres—and there was worse trouble over that ; but I
wasn't taking any more St. Mungo by that time.
Rather late in the day medical science is
suggesting that the IState school curriculum should
include some rudimentary instruc-
tion as to the effects of tobacco
smoking on human nature, physical
and moral. After all, the scholastic
teaching of the young doesn’t go
much further than teaching them to
learn lessons from books. Incident-
ally, the youngsters are told
not to do certain things, and
are warned against certain
“ vices ”; but a boy
leaves school without
having been taught
exactly why he
should avoid the
vices that are not
abstained from by his
“old man” at home.
He learns nothing about
the laws of health or
how to assist the
strengthening of his
young, growing body
bv hardening himself
against small ailments of
the chest and taking
reasonable precautions
against rheumatic fever
find lung complaints.
The values of various
measures of self-develop-
ment, self-restraint and
self-protection are not ex-
plained to lads and lasses.
The education of the
studious and non-stud ious
alike is shockingly neg-
lected, and by that neglect
medical science has
unduly. The re-
cent recom-
mendation

boys and cigar-
ettes is the result
of a threatened Bill to
prohibit all smoking of
cigarettes. Three doc-
tors, in defending their
adult patients from the
chargeof inflicting injury on
themselves, didn’t hesitate
to admit that boys ought to be forbidden tobacco
find t,aught the why and wherefore of the restric-
tion. It was only the threat of prohibitory legis-
lation that wrung the advice from those enthusi-
astic guardians of the public ill-health.

“ Jean 5.,” in distress, from Melbourne :
Of all Australia’s foolish imported habits, one of the
most foolish is that of making a smoke, a smell, and a
noise, none of them pleasant, on the anniversary of this,
that, and the other “royal” event. The other day it
was the anniversary of Somebody or other’s coronation.
I was in the St. Kilda-road at the time, and a drizzling
rain was falling, when about 20 soldiers marched our of
the barracks, and on to a rise in the Domain, where they
solemnly loaded and fired off some pieces of artillery.
Just as solemnly they lined up and marched back to
the barracks after they had finished; and I won-
dered why some people regard this sort of cere-
mony as distinctly right and proper. Nobody was
a straw the better for the whole tired business.
The gentleman who wears the crown couldn’t either hear
the noise or notice the smell. Besides me and the 20
men who walked up the hill and down again, there were
only a few loungers and travellers and cows in the neigh-
borhood ; and it didn’t seem to improve any of them.” I
doubt if one of the cows gave even a pint extra that
night. And it certainly didn’t improve the guns ;in
fact, they are the worse for every discharge, and we may
want them some day when we are firing for keeps. Also
the soldiers were the worse for getting wet. Must we
go on doing this silly business for ever? If we are loyal,
can’t we find some less idiotic way of saying so ?
“ Montalex ” : Was moved to much wrath
and disgust, the other day, by the efforts of a
Sydney “John ” to despatch a disabled horse with
his revolver. He had planted three useless bullets
in the invalid’s head, when I was injudiciously
moved to exclaim: “Here, man! give me that
thing, and I’ll settle the poor brute with a single
shot !” The brass-buttoned bungler haughtily
surveyed me for a moment before he fell back in
good order upon the time-honored, “Mind your
own business !’’ As I retired in a properly humble
frame of mind, I heard three further shots, as
ineffective as the others—for I learnt afterwards
that the atrocity had to be completed with an axe.
Now, I donot recommend for Johannes aforesaid an
elaborate course of anatomy, but I certainly think
he should be taught where to plant an instantly
fatal bullet in the caput of a seriously injured
animal. And, by the way, if all our local police-
squirts are like the one I saw misused on this
occasion, I’m not surprised that the pursuing
copper should miss his man as a regular thing.
The pistol appeared to be the Weblev bulldog, a
solid little 45-calibre article with a Sin. barrel,
meant only for very close quarters, and wholly
unreliable, even in the hands of an expert, at more
than a few yards’ range.
In the absence of a Foundling Home,
strange things may happen to a little Australian.
For instance, there is the ease of (say) He Smvthe,
jun. Annie De Smyth increased Victoria’s popu-
lation by one on August 8, 1908, at Geelong. The
new-chum’s presumed father-—(say) Frederick
De Browne—had previously called on Nurse
Reed, at Coburg, and arranged for the adoption of
the infant, paying her £3O, no less. The day after
the child was born, Nurse Reed’s daughter, a
damsel of 18. went to Geelong and called for the
£3O worth of goods, and delivered the parcel at
Mrs. Reed’s. After this the parcel becomes
vague, but from the inquiries of constables, who
put interfering fingers into the question of the
child’s non-vaccination, it seems that Mrs. Reed
handed the infant (which had been worth
£3O to get rid of) to Mrs. Newman, who passed
it on to Mrs. Milburne. Mrs. Reed seems to have
had great difficulty in discovering Mrs. Newman,
whom she alleged lived at Mordialloc but had gone
to Tasmania ; still after some police pressure she
presently discovered her at Fitzroy. Also the
police discovered that Mrs. Newman was Mrs.
Bell when she wasn’t Mrs. Newman. But Mrs.
Newman, who is Mrs. Bell sometimes, said she
didn’t know anything about the infant, having
merely introduced Mrs. Reed to a missing Mrs.
Milburne. What looked like a dead end was
reached here; but just then the police happened
across Mrs. Reed and Mrs. Newman (if she
wasn’t Mrs. Bell. They were at a doctor’s, getting
a baby vaccinated. Asked if this was the
bahv De Smytbe, Mrs. Newman seemed painfully
vague about the matter, and Mrs. Reed couldn't
swear it was ; so far as she knew, it was just a
baby. Further, the constable discovered thnt
Mrs. Milburne was really somebody else—in fact,
she is possibly two or three people. So to go on
with, Nurse Reed was charged with several offences
against the Infant Life Protection Act; but the
honorariums considered it might be as well to let
a P.M. sort the matter out, and the case was .ad-
journed. It is mentioned that there are at least
half a score of charges that might be fired against
the parties concerned ; but the chief one—that of
mislaying a valuable Australian baby—doesn’t
seem to have been heaved at anybody so far.
In the Cold Land no provision was made
till quite recently to supply pensions to the very
poor. The Tories and a big majority of Whig
“Liberals” in Parliament after Parliament de-
nounced the idea with horror as “ rank Socialism, ”
and rent it and stamped on it fiercely whenever it
bobbed up. Instead there has existed for upwards
of half a century an arrangement for giving
pensions to the affluent. Henry Lucy, the S. M.
Herald’s tame London chronicler of social small-
beer, provides (21/8/’O9) some instances of the way
rich Britons have swindled the State out of
pension-money. For example :
One of the earliest beneficiaries was 0. P. Villiers. He,
of course, made the statutory declaration as to his private
means which is a necessary preliminary to bestowal of the
pension. After receiving it for a period exceeding a
quarter of a century he died, his will revealing possession
of a large fortune. Another very old-age pensioner is
Viscount Cross. Considering that he ranks as a country
gentleman of comfortable estate, was at one time, if not
now, partner in a banking firm, it has always been a
matter of commiserating comment among his friends that
he should have been dependent all these years upon
assistance from the public Treasury. Oddly enough, ever
since the Act came into force it is members of the landed
gentry, the aristocratic class, that have formed the
majority of pensioners. Up to the eve of the fall of Mr.
Balfour’s Administration the statesman then known as
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach was on the pension list. He re-
tired with a peerage, just in time (and there was not
much to spare) to allow the Premier to transfer the
pension to his own brother, Mr. Gerald Balfour, who now
enjoys it.
If an Australian working-man (say) augmented
his screw by this sort of thing he would be (1)
ashamed to look his associates in the eye during
the process, and (2) an almost certain candidate
in due course for hard labor on charges ranging
from obtaining money under false, pretences
to perjury. The Briton of position on easy
State-aid bent isn’t hampered, seemingly, by
these considerations.
* * * *
General Gordon got a broad hint lately
about the need for compulsory military training.
He spent a lot of time travelling to Nowra
(N.S.W.) to inspect the senior cadets, and found
only 12. The rest were absent because their em-
ployers wouldn’t let them attend, and there is no
law to compel the employers to let them attend.
Even if there was such a law, it wouldn’t do the
cadet much good ; the employer would end the
trouble by sacking him and hiring another boy.
And if real war comes, the chances are that,
under the present fool system, the cadet won’t be
allowed to attend then either—mot that the
cadet would amount to so much in real war that
his attendance would make any serious difference.
The voluntary system is always bumping up
against the employer. There was great joy m
London a few months ago because a big insuranc ;
office decided that it would engage no new men
who didn’t join the Territorial Army. This com-
pulsion by the insurance office was regarded as a
triumph for the voluntary system. So the young
man who got a billet with the co. joined the
Territorials and wore his uniform with pride.
Then he lost his billet for some cause or other,
and other employers said they didn’t want any
Territorials as the periodical absences for training
were a nuisance ; and now there is a compulsory
volunteer about who doesn’t know whether it is
the voluntary or the compulsory system he should
curse most.

Adelaide, Monday.—Rev. 0. H. Neild, head of the
Anti-Gambling League, paid his second visit to the races
on Saturday, to watch the betting fraternity and the
t.otalisator at work. Mr. Neild described the racing as
deadly dull.— S.A. Neivs Item.
The citizen who’s looking for excitement
Need not repair where “books" with punters strive
In future. Racing (i ride Neild’s indictment)
Is boring. He who yearns to feel alive,
And hankers for a really stirring heart-thrill,
Will flee the race-track at a fearful rate
Henceforth, nor falter in his headlong dart till
He hears the thrippence tinkling in the plate
Within an edifice where ceaseless battle
Is waged ’gainst Satan. Here a paltry cash
Donation gives all hands the right to rattle
Old Nick, what time he tries to make his dash.
No stern officials watch with int’rest burning
To see that each contestant gets a fair
And level go. Sharp bumps at ev’ry turning
Baulk Nicholas ; and pocketings impair
His chances when he hastens up the last stretch ;
So that the crowd is fain to lay its sox
Against the harassed, battered and aghast wretch
That staggers, ultimately, past the Box.
E’en if, despite the popular derision
. And hatred, Nick contrives to win, a howl
Of disapproval burgles the decision
From him ;—he’s promptly turned down on a “foul.”
Sport on mere licensed racing tracks is not on
A par with this alluring game, wherein
The Kirk perennially “ puts the pot on ”
Of him who wears the cap and sleeves of Sin.

“MEN’S
OUTFITTERS
309-311 Georg'e Street, Sydney,
The feature that out-stood in the Clarke
divorce case, heard last week in Melbourne,
was its beautiful, orderly symmetry, and
slickness and happy despatch. The stage-
management of it was masterly. Punctually to
the hour Rupert got him out of the trouble zone,
where his presence would have been nought but
an embarrassment and a thing of supererogation.
The petitioner had the exactly right amount of
evidence to meet the requirements of the case—
no more, no less. Nothing violent or uti-
gentlemanly was alleged to cause the respondent
to be condemned as a “brute”; nor any-
thing of the mawkishly sentimental order
to make him look ridiculous. Just a
little discreet evidence regarding evenings
spent with the co-re. ; and a fraction of still more
discreet testimony re money-payments to the
fascinating home-burster ; and finally a couple of
the dearest little billets doux from the same damsel,
of a type, both of them, that might be left lying
on any drawing-room table without fear of
damage to the morals of the youngest of young
persons. The court was crowded, but the curious
ones reaped scant sensational reward for their
trouble in butting a passage in there. The busi-
ness went through without a suspicion of a thrill
or hitch—a veritable model for all ceremonies of
the sort. The verdict of Society (the genuine
article which spells itself with a large S) is that
all parties have “behaved extremely well” over
the unfortunate business. Especially warm are
the encomiums heaped upon the absent Rupert.
He is held to have comported himself not merely
like a man, but like a man of the world.
THE CIGARETTES OF CLARENCE.
SHE: “ What cigarettes does Clarence smoke?”
HE : “ His friends.”
They have a quaint taste in memorials on
the' N.S.W. South Coast. Central Iljawarra
municipality, “the home of the dairying indus-
try,” had its 50th anniversary, and at the usual
banquet—
Instead of erecting a fountain to commemorate the
inauguration of the municipality, Alderman McDonald
suggested that steps should be taken towards effecting
the release of an old resident who had, unfortunately,
been imprisoned for four years on a certain charge.
Evidently the banqueters approved of the idea
cordially, it was so beautifully cheap ; and Mr.
Morton and Mr. Nicholson, of the State Parlia-
ment, promised to assist in the matter.
“ J.G.”: The hand of the land monopolist
is heavy upon Victoria, right up to the threshold
of the metropolis. Travel the first 30 or 40 miles
out of Melbourne along the Sydney-road and you
will see struggling townships now and then, with
here and thereafarm ; but the bulk of the country'
is given over to sheep, briar,
bracken and rabbits. All
the townships are about 50
years old ; but, instead of
growing, they are fading
gradually out of exist-
ence. The few odd
cookies are also being
gradually strangled
by the land sharks.
About Wallan, one
of the oldest town-
ships on the Syd-
ney' road, thous-
ands of acres of
land that could,
and should, be
maintaining
hundreds of
families, are
given over
to a
smattering
of the woolly
animal.
The land is
held in such
big areas
that the
owners do
not try to
keep the
briars,
bracken,
rabbits and
other pests
down, with
the result that
the whole
countryside
suffers. The
cocky puts up a
good fight, but too
frequently lie is
knocked out after a few
rounds, gives the land
best, and sells out to the
squatter. Then the township suffers through
the loss of the farmer and his family. In this
way, Wallan is losing its population, and, if
something isn’t done, the place will soon be dead.
Nearly all the townships in the district are wasting
away of the same disease. It is gruesome when
you remember that the blighted district is only
about an hour’s rail from Melbourne, and that it
contains some of the best land and about the best
climate in the State.
A paper of tremendous importance has
just been presented to the several Parliaments by
order of the various Figureheads—a paper pre-
pared “ At the Court at St. James’s, the 2nd day
of April, 1909. there being present His Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales (in large capitals),
Lord President, Lord Steward, Lord Haversham,
Lord Pentland.” “It is expedient,” says the
Court at St. James’s, after running itself out
of breath through reeling off some appalling
sentences —
Ifc is expedient with a view of equalising as far as may
be the conditions under which His Majesty’s subjects in
the British Dominions beyond the Seas shall have a right
of appeal to His Majesty in Council, and to promoting
uniformity in thepractice and procedure in all such appeals
that the said Order in Council dated the 13th of Novem-
ber, 1850, should he revoked and new provision
made for Appeals from the said Supreme
Court to His Majesty in Council.
Therefore His Royal Highness the
Prince of Wales, being authorised
thereto by writing under His
Majesty’s Sign Manual, doth
make some new and import-
ant rules; the more par-
ticularly relating to the
Record, or Statement of
the Case. And the
working part of the
tremendous revolu-
tion made by His
Highness, etc., being
authorised, etc., is
contained in a
schedule, as follows :
I. Records and Cases
in Appeals to His Majesty
in Council shall be
printed in the form
known as Demy Quarto
( i.e ., 54 ems in length
and 42 in width).
11. The size of the
paper used shall be such
that the sheet, when
folded and trimmed,
will he 11 inches in
height and 8J inches in
width.
111. The type to be used
in the text shall be Pica
type, but Longr Printer shall be
used in printing accounts, tabular
matter arid notes.
IV. The number of lines in each page
of Pica type shall be 47 or thereabouts, and
every tenth line shall be numbered in the margin.
Then, no doubt, having breathlessly authorised
this new Magna Charta, His Highness the Prince
of Wales staggered home and wondered what
other burden a nation would next think of putting
on a poor prince for a beggarly forty or fifty
thousand a year.

‘‘ Malacoota : ” Along the Vic. coast, be-
tween Green Cape and Wilson’s Prom., population
is scanty and wrecks fairly frequent. The people
don’t pray for wrecks down there, because it is a
land without religious services, but they keep a
watchful eye seaward in bad weather. Old hands
talk enthusiastically of past windfalls, when eases
of kerosene and whisky and other portable com-
modities were gathered in great quantities from
their beaches. An American flour ship is a living
memory, also a German loaded with general mer-
chandise. One man got a case of repeating rifles
out of this vessel; he buried them in the sand
until a favorable time should arrive for their re-
moval. But an interfering police force stayed so
long in the vicinity of the wreck that he forgot the
place, and has been vainly endeavoring to locate
his cache ever since. Apropos, part of the hull
and the winch of an unknown ship were discovered
not so long ago near the Wingen. No.one knows
what the vessel was, or when or why she went
ashore. Another of the unsolved mysteries of
the sea.
IN THE OUT-PATIENTS’ ROOM.
HOSPITAL DOCTOR: “Well, what's the matter
with you?”
PATIENT: “ Well, sir, I dunno. I cats well, I
drinks well, an’ I sleeps well; but as soon as
I see’s a bit o’ work, I comes out all of a cold
sweat, an’ trembles that much I can hardly
stand."
The mysterious fascination of the Chow !
In Liverpool (England), where there is a regular
“ Chinese quarter,” the police report the greatest
difficulty in keeping young girls away from it.
One of the more respectable Chinese restaurants
has actually had to put up a notice, “ Ladies will

“ Cantab,” from the land of Ward and
Dreadnoughts:—
It is generally acknowledged that
the Maoriland police force is wretch-
edly underpaid. A constable starts
at 7s. 6d. per day, working seven days
in the week, and gets 6d. per day rise
every four years. A man must have
served 12 months in the force before
he is permitted to marry, and then he
receives an extra shilling a day as
“ house allowance.” An eminent
actuary has estimated the daily cost
of a policeman’s wife at is. The
allowance of holidays is 12 days in a
year. A constable must pay for his
uniform—which costs from 355. to £2
—and he also has to buy his own boots
and settle his own washing bills. In
some barracks the police, by catering
for themselves, manage to reduce
the cost of victualling per head to
£2 15s. or £3 for the month. But at
the smaller police stations it costs a
man fully £1 a week for his mess. I
believe the Commission now sitting
will recommend Is. a day increase in
pay and a few more holidays a year.
If the Maoriland thief destroyer isn’t
all that he might be, it must be ad-
mitted that he doesn’t get much
encouragement to repair his ways.
The shilling wife especially must be a
severe trial.
In quite a simple way the Law gob the
surprise of its life last week at Bega (N.S. W.). A
local parent was summoned under the Neglected
Children’s Act for not sending his boy to Sunday-
school. The boy had been before the Children’s
Court, and the magistrate had committed him
under the Act to the custody of his father on
probation. Now the Act provides that in such a
case the parent must comply with five conditions,
the fifth being that he is to despatch his offspring
regularly to a church and Sunday-school of his
own religious denomination. The Law carefully
proved all the formalities, such as the existence of
Bega, etc., and otherwise justified the charge.
Then it breathed heavily and demanded an ex-
planation. The accused simply said he hadn’t a
religious denomination, and the case fell dead on
the spot.
“ Hard Drinker ” writes :
The York Hotel, once Adelaide’s most famous caravan-
serai, is going to make a hid to recover its old-time
glories. Built far down Bundle-street, it is adjacent to
little but the Exhibition and the Zoo; so other pubs,
handier to the theatre, the railway station and the oval
have taken all the actors and cricket teams, and everyone
else who can afford big prices for hoard and lodging. A
year or two ago Foy and Gibson descended on Adelaide
and built an enormous series of shops just beyond the
York, thus bringing people into a district which was
falling into the hands of market-gardeners and Chinese
laundry-men. The Foy people bought up the York, and
it was thought that they might simply forfeit the license
and absorb it, as their chief rivals, Marshall and Co., have
eaten up the Globe, once the racing-man’s gathering
place. But they are rebuilding the house instead, with
the idea of making an up-to-date pub triumph over the
accident of its position. Syd Ferry, the old amateur
steeplechaser, has been manager of the York for years
past.

At Pentridge Gaol (Vic.) a man recently
made an effort to hang himself, and died in the
attempt. Shortly afterwards, a medicine man, in
practice at Warracknabeal, wrote to the papers
deploring the state of affairs which led to the
man’s death. The deceased, it appeared, suffered
from the pot-hooking trouble. He had been in
the Warracknabeal doctor’s employ, and had
shown himself a good and willing worker ; but the
shifting of beer-pots had him down continually,
and a charge of vagrancy resulted in his being
shot in for a useless, expensive stay in a gaol.
VVith all his talk of Inebriate Retreats and Homes
for the Fallen Cigarette-Fiend, John No Hurry
still allows people suffering from the drink
disease to be passed in among the rogues and
thieves and wife-bashers, where anything in the
way of scientific treatment of the victim is out of
the question.

“ Philoyid ” writes :
There is said to be an absurd Masonic scheme for the
third re-building of Solomon’s Temple. (The second
re-building was by Herod the Great, shorty before the
appearance of Christ.) Why trouble over the luckless
structure? There seemed to be a curse on it from first
to last. It was the beginning of the disruption of the
kingdom ; when Jerusalem in Judah was made the
centre, not only of the government but of the national
religion, and the rest of the k.ngdorn was beggared to
build golden adornments for this one city, the great rival
tribe of Ephraim felt it was time to secede, audit took most
of Israel with it. Solomon was the child of crime ; his
father murdered his mother’s first husband in order to
,ecure her. And he lived up to his record, for he was
probably the most garish and expensive fool of his time.
There is no reason to believe that he wrote a line of the
works ascribed to him, and his reputation for wisdom was
based on his dabblings in magic and his pottering after
afreets, djinns, evil spirits, and such like trash. Also, he
was great on strange wives and strange idolatries. His
harem, his palace, and his temple got on Israel’s nerves.
Not only did he tax the people heavily to pay for them,
but he struck the gorgeous idea of making his subjects
tramp, at their own cost, to his public works every three
months, putin a month’s work there, and then tramp
back. As a result, the miserable backblocks Israelite
seems to have had about three months in the year at
home. No wonder he objected. On top of all Sol made
his hungry subjects come bodily to Jerusalem to see him
burn and destroy 22,000 buliocks and 120,000 sheep
at the dedication of his sacred building, and the
smell of overdone flesh was probably smelt as far as
Ephraim. Israel was a very small country, and the
chances are that the people had to live on vegetables for
years after that appalling waste. Solomon was the boss
centralisation man ; Jerusalem was made the only place
of worship, and the remote Hebrew was expected to hoof
it about 100 miles to church. Israel bucked at that, and
it probably bucked harder still when Solomon gave away
a slice of the kingdom to an adjacent idolator in return

for gold with which to decorate his amazing kirk. The
last, straw must have arrived when the nation found that its
great monarch was a cur. When the empire began to
fall to pieces, Solomon seems to have hidden behind the
kitchen sink ; anyhow, there is no mention that he ever
went out to battle, ltehoboam, his son, appears to have
been the original cigarette-fiend, or something like that;
which, considering the kind of father he had, was hardly
wonderful. No, that temple had better be left alone. It
brought no luck to anybody.
A PLAINT OF SENTIMENTALISM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Peninsula and Oriental Company has sold the
steamers Victoria and Britannia to an Italian company.
Cable Item.
Bartered away for Dago cash ! Ah me,
The callousness of trade !
It proves once more that sentiment can’t be,
Where money’s to be made.
For decades past these vessels have conveyed,
Along the sea-route worn
’Twixt here and London town, man, matron, maid,
Most of them British born.
There is no nook or cranny from the bows
Unto the twin-screws aft
Of these old ships but’s echoed to soft vows
And passionate. Abaft
Each hatchway, by each smoke-stack, ’neath each
mast
Fond folks have lurked and told
Their loves, careless of any tropic blast,
Undaunted by the cold
Regardless even of the Seedee boy
And quick eared Lascar who
Prowled ever round —and aye, they voiced their joy
In the tongue Shakspeare knew.
There’s not an inch of all that wide deck space
Which is not haunted by
Some Anglo-Saxon figure, voice or face
That’s now a memory.
It is no ordinary deal, this last—
The point’s clear at a glance—
More than a vend of ships ’tis. It’s a vast
Job sale of Old Romance.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The agreement which the Fused Deakin fixed
up the other day with the State Premiers looks pretty
disastrous whichever way it is considered. For the first
year the Commonwealth will have to pay the States about
£5,375,000; it will have to pay old-age pensions, formerly
a State liability (about £1,800,000); and it is to make a
special payment of £125,000 to Westralia ; total about
£7,300,000. That means that if the net revenue from
Customs and Excise gets down to £9,125,000, the Com-
monwealth will be just as badly off as ever. Now, the net
tariff revenue in 1906, according to Knibbs’s figures, was
down to £8,721,896, less £154,709 rebate of the sugar excise,
making a mere £8,567,187. The new tariff rushed the net
tariff revenue up to £11,333,145 in 1908, less £584,622 re-
bate on sugar—total £10,748,523. It is now rapidly on the
down grade again—it dropped £BOO,OOO by June, 1909
for the growth of manufactures is reducing the imports
of dutiable goods. So it is fairly probable that, even in
the first year of the new arrangement, the Common-
wealth will be no better off than it was under the
Braddon clause, before the Commonwealth took over the
old-age pension liability. Then the payments to the
•States are to increase automatically ever3 r year for all
time, \\-hether the Federal revenue increases or not—they
are to increase with the growth of population. And the
old-a<re pension liability will also increase. As the price
of this utterly disastrous agreement, the States are to
allow the Commonwealth this year £600,000, to which it
isn’t entitled under the Braddon clause, but that
is much less than N.S.W. and Victoria save through the
Commonwealth taking over their old-age pension liabili-
ties. And even then the Fused Government will, by its own
calculations, end the financial year and stare the new
arrangement with £600,000 of a shortage. For a Govern-
ment that is pledged not to levy direct taxation, and
which has the Northern Territory, the two transconti-
nental railways, the Federal capital and the defence
policj r on its mind, the situation could hardly be worse,
and the agreement made with the State Premiers couldn't
be much worse.

The Melbourne municipalities formed themselves into a
Trust, and borrowed the money to build the tramways ;
then they handed them over to this co. on lease till June
30, 1916, which is seven years from now. The co. was re-
quired (1) To pay interest on the Trust’s debt; (2) to
provide a sinking fund for the extinction of the Trust’s
debt; (3) to keep the lines in repair and hand them back
in good working condition. The sinking fund contribu-
tion was £33,000 a year till 1905 ; it was then to be
£45,000, at which figure it still stands. So, considering
the tramways as a business, this is how they have panned
out during the past two years :
„ , 1908. 1909.
Pi ofit as shown above .. .. £148,315 £167,906
Sinking fund for Trust .. .. 45,000 45,000
Trust’s debenture interest .. 74,250 74,250
_ . Total £267,565 £287,156
Dess interest on co.’s investments 26,190 28,165
Net revenue of undertaking .. £241,375 £258,991
The total income was £580,495. All working expenses,
including wages, salaries, rates, insurance, fuel, repairs
and maintenance (£69,681), and depreciation of lease-
holds were thus £321,504. All working expenses thus
absorbed 54 "4 percent, of the revenue, leaving 44 - 6 per
cent, for interest, dividend, or return of capital.
Remarkable progress has been made by the co.
during the past 10 years. In the table at the top of this the
dividend is calculated on the £250,000 actually paid-up
by shareholders; but another £230,000 has been capi-
talised out of profits. Notwithstanding that dividends
calculated on this basis have steadily moved up from
Hi Per cent, in 1899 to 38 2-5 per cent, in 1909, the co.
has saved up liquid assets to the extent of £720,697
during these 10 years; but as the debts have increased by
£144,915, the net accumulation for the 10 years is
£575,782. The movement of liquid and other assets has
been as follows;
1899. 1908. 1909.
Liquid assets .. £274,718 £887,489 £995 415
Freeholds .. 283,267 245,786 244,507

Less debts .. 67,963 182,515 212,878
Surplus .. £691,357 £1,103,307 £1,176,585
Besides the surplus for 1909, shown in the last line above,
the co. owns leaseholds which are being written down
every year, and now stand at £10,751. So we get :
Surplus as above .. ..£1,176,585
Leaseholds 10 751
Total £1,187,336
This represents ;
The Reserves as above .. £937,336
The Capital 250,000
Total £1,187,336
It will be seen that “ freeholds ” and “ other property ”
have shrunk in value. (“Other property ” consists'of
cars,; material, rope, stock, etc.) There may have been
some sales ; but apparently these assets have been mostly
written down out of profits. Whether, however, they
are worth their book value there is no way of testing.
They may be worth much more—if they can find a buyer.
The municipalities take over the business on July 1, 1916.
Of course, the cable system will be superseded by the
electric, which will destroy most of the value of many of
these assets. But in the interval between July 1, 1916,
and electrification something will have to be used ; ’so the
management of this co. evidently reckons that its cars,
grips, ropes, bell-punches, etc., will be worth a good deal!
The reserves as shown above (including the
£230,000 which has been transferred to capital) are
£937,336. This amount is represented as follows (figures
for 1899 and 1908 added for comparison) :
1899. 1908. 1909.
Capitalised profits .. £230,000 £230,000 £230,000
Renewal reserve .. .. 225,577 249,571 244,797
For return of capital .. 178,780 215/137
Dividend reserve .. .. 9,425 12,000 12,000
Investment depreciation 20,000 20 000
Other depreciation .. 150,000 185.000
Undivided profit .. .. 30,420 25,079 30,502
_ £495,422 £865,430 £937,336
Less Goodwill item .. 49,366
Net Reserves.. .. £446,056 £865,430 £937,336
The goodwill item mentioned above was the interest on
the Trust’s debt and the liability for sinking fund instal-
ments accumulated while the' lines were being con-
structed. This “ asset ” was gradually written off out of
profits. Probably some of the reserves are not of the best
character—the renewal reserve, for instance: this is
being drawn upon to a small extent. Assuming that
during the next seven years the past seven years’ history
will be repeated, we get this result:—
Seven years’ profits £873,609
Present reserves 937,336
Capital 250,000
Total £2,060,945
Provided the freeholds and “other property” realised their
book value, that would give £2 2s. lOd. for distribution
per each 960,000 th share during the ensuing seven years,
or as soon thereafter as the business is completed.
But in connection with that forecast three things
have to be remembered: —(l) The profits have increased
very rapidly, and they may possibly go on increasing,
while in this forecast only the average of the past seven
3'ears has been taken and applied to the next seven years;
(2) the interest on the accumulations swells every'year ;
but, on the other hand (3), the co. may possibly not
realise book value for its freeholds and “ other property.”

This co. had some heavy losses in the’nineties, both by
fire and by depreciation of securities. It has, however, a
fine, solid, and cheaply held connection in Victoria, and
has made a good recovery ; yet it isn’t by any means the
most hustling office in Australia, and the growth of its
business hasn’t been at all remarkable. Its expense rate
is, however, extremely moderate; and that has been
largely responsible for the very fair accumulation of
reserves in spite of the big dividends. The paid capital is
only £50,181; but adding the reserves to that, the total
funds equal 183 per cent, of the past year’s premiums ;
and taking the premiums to be the best measure of the
risks, this is very satisfactory. For 1907—the last year for
which figures are yet available—the average proportion of
capital and reserves held by the 19 great British fire
offices was only 141 per cent. Ten years ago the Victoria
Co.’s position was v»3aker than the present British
average—it then had only 129 per cent, of reserves com-
pared with premiums—but to-day its position is just
about one-third stronger, on figures, than even the British
average ; and the British average is far stronger than
that of most of the European Continental cos. with
which so many of the British offices have re-insurance
treaties. Some other comparisons to show the Victoria’s
history

The co. does a little accident and guarantee business
also ; and that makes its expense rate seem all the more
moderate. Its assets are more liquid than those of some
offices ; over £82,000 is on deposit, apart from branch
balances. Another £46,333 is in real estate (book value) ■
and that is probably a weak feature. Anyway, the
interest return, on the average of all the invest-
ments, is only about £3 6s. per cent. With so
much out on deposit a high return is not to be looked
for ; but £3 6s. is a very low average, and suggests either
over-valuation of the real estate, or that the co. does not
credit its interest earnings with rent for its own office
premises—which would, of course, mean on the other
side that the expenses are not charged with the same
item. But whether this is the practice or not you can’t
tell from the accounts. All that you can tell is that both
interest earnings and expense rate are very low, and the
lowness of the one rubs some of the gilt off the lowness of
the other.

The co. is doing one of two improper things. Either it is
writing off too much for depreciation, and is thus under-
stating its true profits ; or if it is stating its true profits
correctly, then it is paying away too much in dividends—
for the second term it has paid away more than it is shown
to have earned. And it is not as though it was over-
whelmed with reserves ; all it has, in fact, are. these :
Share premiums .. . .£13,687
Marine insurance fund .. 3278
Undivided profit .. .. 128
Total .. .. £17,093
The share premiums ought not in any circumstances to be
paid away in dividends ; the marine'insurance fund is not
the best sort of a reserve, being, in fact, an accumulation
against a risk which hasn’t expired ; and all that is left
over and beyond that is £l2B. Of course there may be a
hidden reserve, created by using profits to write down
ship and other properties below their true value. It would
be an amazing thing, though, if a management deliber-
ately wrote off too much and left insufficient net profits
to pay the dividend. Certainly the Profit and Loss
account for the half-year does show enough of a balance
to pay the dividend ; but from that balance has to be
deducted £422, which has been taken out of the marine
insurance reserve, presumably to make good a loss
Altogether, the position of the co. is most uncertain. It
was in very low wafer for a long while, and had a fleet of
mostly decrepit arks ; but then it sprouted afresh, got in
more capital, bought two or three new boats, secured
quantities of land for picnic places, and generally reached
out for the harbor traffic. This shows how the fi«- ures
nave moved:— 0

have been reduced rapidly, partly out of new capital and
premiums, partly out of sales, partly no doubt out of
revenue written off ships to cover wear and tear. The
ship item has been reduced by £3809 in 18 months ; and
as no additions have been made to the fleet, while one
small vessel, the Pearl, has disappeared, it does not look
as though very much has been written off for deprecia-
tion. Probably some renewals have been effected ; but
even allowing for that the true profits appear to have
been by no means under-stated. In that case the divi-
dends are being barely earned.

The society was landed in the usual trouble by the tidal
wave of the boom in the late ’eighties and early ’nineties,
and from 1892 to 1900 it paid no div. The progress
towards filling up the hole was, however, so small, and
the absence of a div. was putting such a cheek on busi-
ness, that the directors finally took the hippopotamus by
the horn and wrote off half the capital. After that
things looked better. A contingency fund was created
to cover possible losses on sales ; but there have been
none of much consequence. In fact, as one column in
the foregoing table shows, properties have usually given'
a net surplus over their written-down values. Since the
cleaning up, various items have moved like this

The society has thus been going very slowly. Though
the deposits and other liabilities have grown lately, they
are still less than they were in 1901; and though the
advances have in 8£ years gone up from £19,998 to £53,418,
the money has been got either from the sale of foreclosed
properties—-mostly old written-down properties—or from
accumulated profits. The paid capital is £47,797 ; so the
borrowed money in the business is little, and consequently
the risks are unusually small. Indeed, only the severity
of the uriting down and the excellence of the rent
return from properties in possession—about £6 7s. 6d.
per cent, net—enable so good a dividend to be paid.

The profit and loss account shows for the half-year “Net
profits after providing for renewals, etc., £6272”; but,
besides that, £lB6 has dropped into the Redemption fund.
Renewals, it will be noticed, are charged up with
working expenses. There is, however, a Depreciation
fund, £21,141 ; and a reserve for renewals and eontin-
g-encies, £10,654. Possibly 7 these reserves are in whole or
part a reserve against actual wear and tear and loss of value;
and in that case the additions to these reserves are not true’
profits. In other words, if the renewals (size and extent
unknown) don’t fully counterbalance the depreciation of
plant, then neither the profits nor the reserves are really
as large as they are said to be. If they were, of course,
the surplus in excess of dividend just now would be
very fine. One suspicious circumstance is that five
years ago the assets were re-valued, and no less than
£118,293 had to be written off, partly out of reserves, but
mostly out of capital. This practically meant that for
many years the profits had been badly over-estimated,
and that some of the dividends had been paid out of capi-
tal without the directors knowing it. And the last is
easily possible. It isn’t merely that plant wears out, but
in this sort of business it is liable to become obsolete very
quickly, whereupon it has to be superseded. What
revenue ought to be provided against this probability
can only be guessed at. If a management guesses too
little, then it makes the profits too high—for the profits
are really only a guess, too. In this case the directors
apparently write off nothing at all ; they simply pay for
renewals. Yet.it is quite likely that something extra in
the way of renewals will arrive presently, and then some
of the present reserves will have to be written off—which
is another way of saying that some of the past alleged
profits will have to be written off. The better profits
shown for the term just ended are, no doubt,
partly due to the bigger export trade in frozen
meat (this co. supplies the cold storage). The
high prices which ruled after the last drought meant that
it didn’t pay to buy for export ; so this co. suffered.
Now, however, there is a big surplus, and it will go on
swelling until the next drought comes along, and sweeps
off a few million head. The co. is now in 183,460 shares
of 12s. paid to 10s. The financial position has improved
considerably since the last cleaning up :

Most of this improvement occurred prior to June, 1907 ;
in the past two years practically all the undivided profit
has gone into new plant, etc.; and possibly this was
necessary merely in order to make good the wear and
tear of the previous three years.

The year’s results look better on the surface than they do
underneath ; for only £4l has been written off against
depreciation, and that was only on a side line. The
machinery, plant and fittings stand in the books at
£22,170, exclusive of buildings. This machinery, no
doubt, becomes obsolete very quickly ; still, assuming
that even 10 per cent, per annum is enough to provide
for renewals, £2217 ought to be put aside to cover wear
and tear, etc. If that were done, an actual loss would
be shown. Of course, it may be said that so much
was written off two or three years ago that it isn’t
necessary to write anything off now. But that
doesn’t alter the fact that the true profits for
the year are less than the published figures show—
it would simply mean that the necessary writing-off was
done in advance and out of capital. However, the posi-
tion has obviously much improved. Under the old State
tariff the co. didn’t pay anything reasonable, but it paid
something; in 1896 the dividend was 2£ per cent., equal
to 5 per cent, on the present capital. It was clear that
the industry couldn’t do with less Protection than one
which only gave the manufacturer 2J per cent. ; neverthe-
less, even some Queenslanders voted for low duties when
Federation arrived. The collapse that followed was so
bad that it was a question whether the business should
not be abandoned, and had not greater assistance
arrived through the Lyne tariff only one thing could
have happened. Even now the future is none too clear ;
for there is an overdraft of £21,298, while the
paid capital is only £23,339, and the need of new
machinery presses upon the co. During the past year the
debt to the bank certainly was reduced by £2070 ; but
not much was done in the way of plant renewals or
additions, and that is likely to be a pretty heavy item in
the future.

This co. was formed in 1902 to take over a co. which was
formed 10 years earlier to purchase the old-established
business of Goodlet and Smith. The earlier co. was only
very moderately prosperous ; and the new co., though it
started with a 6 per cent, dividend, had to reduce it later
on. By 1905, however, flush harvests, big mineral yields
and high prices all round put heaps of money into the
pockets of the people ; and Federation and Protection
caused a big share of it to be spent on this
and other cos.’ Australian manufactures. Hence the
great prosperity shown above. No doubt, owing to the
building boom, this co. has had a very special share of
the fatness of these last few years ; and tlie figures may
ease olf by and bye. On the other hand (l) Federation
and Protection are here for good now, and (2)it is quite
possible that during - these last few years considerable
sums have been spent on additions to plant and have
been paid for out of undisclosed profits. Some of the
balance-sheet figures are traced hereunder
1906. 1907. 1908. 1909.

Properties and machinery, plant, etc., thus remain un-
altered in the balance-sheet ; but whether the additions
paid for out of revenue have more than counterbalanced
the depreciation, it is impossible to say. Yet almost
everything depends on that. The co. may be stuffing
away thousands of pounds of profits, or it may be writing
off too little arid thus eat.ing up its capital. In favor of
the theory that the additions are real additions is the fact
that the profits have been continuously on the up-
grade, and that looks like an increased output. The
capital is £165,000: in proportion to that the
liabilities are rather heavy. In good times, no doubt,
the co. makes a rattling profit out of some of
this debt (its nature isn’t specified); but in bad times
borrowed money, carrying a rate of interest which doesn’t
then come down, is liable to be a heavy burden. Cos.
with heavy debts are therefore always likely to show
erratic net profits ; especially in a country like this which
depends so much on industries that hangupon the uncer-
tain seasons. With regard to the “ ships ” item, the
shVinkage isn't due so much to writing down as to sales.

In 1900 the capital was cut down from £168,750 to
£loB,ooo—and the shareholders didn’t get the £60,750,
either. Anyway, not then ; though they might have had
some of it previously in the shape of excessive dividends.
The cleaning-up wasn’t, however, followed by any great
improvement in the look of the published accounts. The
trouble appears to be a heap of borrowed money on one
side and a heap of unproductive assets on the other.
Unfortunately, the whole of the property—hotels,
brewery, land, etc.—is lumped into one item ;
therefore, it isn’t possible to say the figure
at which the large Cascade estate stands in the
books. It must be something very considerable, though.
An effort is being made to sell parts of this property in
allotments ; but all that the directors commit themselves
to is a very vague remark now and then—“ Sales still
continue.” The accounts don’t suggest that anything
very much is being done. Meantime, while so much pro-
perty is earning little or nothing, the co. has to pay
interest on over £llO,OOO of debt—more, that is, than the
shareholders’ entire capital. This gives the position in
detail: —

Interest paid 3,054 2,771
So freeholds, etc., are still swelling ; and, though a few
repairs are charged up to profit and loss, nothing else is
written off revenue to provide for the general decay of
premises, plant, etc. It is just possible, no doubt,
that che unearned increment on the freeholds is
a good set off to this decay; but unearned
increment is an animal of very gradual and uncertain
growth in Hobart and suburbs ; while decay is sure and
rapid. It seems highly probable, then, that something
ought to be written off ; and yet after paying a 6 per
cent. div. there is mighty little left to write off. It isn’t,
therefore, impossible that at some future date it will be
found that the 6 per cent shouldn’t have been paid. Any-
way, it is to be hoped that this matter of possible depre-
ciation of value has been considered : because if later on
some more capital has to be written off on a revaluation
of assets, it is likely that hard things will be said.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating-mills and workshops, ever}' small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.*

The erection of the new 300-ton Blast Smelting
Furnace for the Great Fitzroy mine, Q., is now rapidly
approaching completion at the mine. The dimensions of
this furnace are as follows—l6Bin. x 44in., and 24ft.
high to feed floor. It is water jacketed from top to
bottom. These jackets are made of steel plates flanged
in one piece. The furnace was designed by the mine
superintendent, and has many features of excellence and
novelty in the detail of its construction. The jackets are
made interchangeable, only one type and size of jacket
being used ; and they will further be-constructed so that
they are reversible from top to bottom —thus practically
the life of the jackets is doubled. This furnace, as well as
the previous one, was built at the works of the Austral
Otis Engineering Company, South Melbourne.* [2

The continued economical success of the up-to-
date steam plant installed by the Brisbane Milling Co.,
Brisbane, consisting of a 300-horse-power Compound Jet
Condensing Robey Engine, with a Babcock and Wilcox
Water-tube Boiler fitted with' Chain Grate Stoker and
Superheater, is a source of much gratification to the
owners ; the coal consumed, whichis common slack, being
less than 1 Jib. per horse-power per hour. We believe
that these actual results establish a record for economy
and reliability that cannot be equalled by any other
system of power.*

There has been a large increase in revenue from sales of
gas, etc. ; yet the total spent on plant, etc., and charged
to capital account is comparatively small. This suggests
that either the old customers are burning much more gas,
or that considerable extensions of mains, etc., have been
paid for out of revenue. In either case it looks very
satisfactory. Or consider it this way :

Liquid assets .. .. 2,200 6,938
Excess liabilities .. £16,379 £9,830
So, in six years, besides paying for all repairs, renewals,
and extensions, the profits, after providing the dividends,
have been large enough to improve the financial position
by £6549. It is a very cheerful record indeed.

* Company’s own ore only ; but the metals recovered
are from purchased ores also.
Besides the loss shown above for the half-year, £8241 is
written off for depreciation. Owing to labor troubles,
the works were shut down most of the term, and the
mine is still being worked on only a very small scale,
pending a recovery in metal values. The co.’s own
reserves of ore are now comparatively small; wherefore
it is laying itself out to do a big custom-smelting busi-
ness—it is quite satisfied to let others root out their ore
when metals are cheap, intending to rush things in its
own mine when they are dear. The co. had in hand over
10,000 tons of purchased concentrates, etc., when the
trouble started at the beginning of this year, and it had
to pay for these goods ; but when it got into a position to
smelt and market the stuff the lead market was much
weaker ; hence a loss on the transaction. The half-year’s
figures may therefore be ruled out so far as being any
basis for valuing the mine is concerned. Still they sug-
gest one of the constantly-recurring possibilities ahead of
Broken Hill; for nothing was settled by the recent
trouble. The co. has a surplus of £406,600 of more or less
liquid assets, as against £457,730 six months ago and
£452,503 on May 30, 1908.

Besides these reserves there is a contingency account,
which has been built up in the last 18 months to £5OOO ;
it is probably a fund which may be drawn on in case the
co. finds that it has over-estimated the value of its
output through a sudden fall in metal values. The
co from which the present co. bought this mine (it
was really a reconstruction), secured the whole turn-out
for a trifle ; but the developments at depth have been
wonderfully good. Last half-year the net profit was
£14,209 ; that was after writing off 10 p.c. of the book
value of plant for depreciation, and after paying for all
development, including shaft-sinking. The net profit
works out at 4s. 3d. per ton. No estimate of ore reserves
is now published ; 12 months ago they were put at
1,100,000 tons. About 140,000 tons have come out since
then ; but assuming that development has equalled ex-
traction, then at 4s. 3d. per ton the reserves are worth
£233,750, or 335. per share. An extra £3 per ton for lead
would bring the profit up to 11s. 6d. per ton, or £632,500
for the lot—£4 10s. per share. The present market
value is £4 6s. A new mill is going up ; it will be finished
about the end of the year, and after that the output (and
very likely the profits) will be about doubled—while the
ore lasts. North B. H. ore reserves will, however, have
to be watched. As said just now, the reserves 12 months
ago were 1,100,000 tons ; and even allowing for good
developments, a mill capable of eating up over 250,000
tons a year will very soon get to the bottom of that lot.
How much further down the ore goes nobody knows.
* * * '*
The tailings deal made by the Broken Hill Junc-
tion directors looks bad for the sellers on the face of it, but
under the surface it looks worse for the man who did the
buying. Many years ago, when the Junction was treat-
ing rich semi-friable ore from the upper levels, tailings
were dumped which, owing to their being slightly porous,
offered special facilities for the air to creep in anil oxidise
them. This oxidisation has been going on for
years to a greater degree than in the dumps of
the other mines, and the flotation processes at
the present time won’t look at the stuff on that
account. The tailings could be re-ground and treated
over concentrating tables, but the oxidised coating on
the lead would be washed away with the slimes. The big
dump, which is the bone of contention, doesn’t assay more
than 7 per cent, lead, and as 2 per cent, of that is not
recoverable, it would take 17 tons of such tailings to make
one ton of concentrates, assaying perhaps 56 per cent,
lead and 260 z. silver. That is better work than was
accomplished when tailings from the old dump were put
through the mill in 1906-7 ; but even that would land the
co. in a small loss. The co.’s previous experiment, made
in 1906, showed a loss of £l2O a week. Naturally the
directors didn’t want any more of that. Although a sec-
tion of the shareholders is kicking against the deal, it
seems to be one of the sanest things the directors have
done for many a day.

The old Prince Charlie, at Copeland (N.S.W.),
which was worked down to 260 ft. some 20 vears ago, is
being opened up again for Capper Bros., of Maitland. A
tunnel has been driven for 1200 ft., and a 10-stamp bat-
tery has been put up. The reef is erratic ; but in the past
10 months three parcels have been put through—2so tons
for 15dwt. per ton ; 60 tons, 60oz. ; 75 tons, 750 z. All
in addition to concentrates. Other claims are also being
worked. Years ago the surface at Copeland was very rich
in pockets, and the place can boast of a 350 z. lump.

Kyloe (N.S.W.), formerly owned and badly-
handled by an Adelaide co., is now run from Sydney.
Sydney mining cos. used to be the most hopeless in Aus-
tralia ; but things have improved in the last few years.
Capital is £60,000 in 20,000 10 per cent. pref. shares (10s.
each)and 100,000 ordinaries, also 10s., both lots fully paid.
Present accounts are for five months to July 3. Revenue
(including “ ore on hand, £4042”) was £10,754 ; expendi-
ture, £4652 ; balance profit, £6102. From this is written,
off £4047 for depreciation and preliminary exes., leaving
£2055 net. But besides new plant, etc., £2673 spent on
mine development has been charged to capital account
and not to working expenses. The financial position on
July 3 was—Liabilities, £265 ; liquid assets (including esti-
mated net value of ore on hand), £9189; surplus, £8924.
The half-year’s results are, however, not of much value as a
criterion, because almost all the ore won has been from
development work. J, VV. Ashcroft, the managing direc-
tor, estimates a profit of £32,762 from the proved ore,
and another £23,875 from the “ probable ” ore between
300 ft. and 400 ft. But from this £9187 is to be written off
to cover cost of development, charged up to capital
account, leaving £47,450 net. This is on the basis of
copper at £55 per ton. A movement of £5 either way, if
it applied to the whole lot, would make a difference of
£16,450. These calculations are, however, based to a
great extent on the new concentrating mill, which has
yet to show what it can do, and, as a rule, a concentrat-
ing mill takes a good while to do anything satisfactory.
On the basis of 19s. for pref. and 17s. for ordinaries, the
market at present values the mine at £104,000. Kyloe
promises to be a good property ; but the market is dis-
counting the future with tremendous energy.

Associated Gold Mines, Ltd. (W.A.), netted
£125,792 for the year ended March last, and after writing
off £64,234 for development, shaft-sinking, diamond-drill-
ing and depreciation, there is a balance (ineluding£l4,3Bs

duty absorbed 165,016, and directors’extra remuneration
took £1238, leaving £9688 to be carried forward. Invest-
ments, which include £130,778 in high-grade securities,
are valued at £136,530. During the year £107,000 Consols
were sold and the proceeds put into Transvaal 3 pfer cents.
Cash resources amount to a further £47,293, from which
has to be deducted £12,526 due to creditors.

Chaffers’ first clean up at the Boulder Main
Reef mill (W.A.) showed a profit of £ll4O. Mining costs
were high, hut this is put down to the heavy initial ex-
penditure in timbering, and the fact that the treatment
necessitates the separation of the oxidised and sulphide
ore in the stopes, which are at the junction of the two
zones. A considerable reduction in costs is promised
within the next few months. Chairman Lewis Aarons,
who once ran Aarons’ Exchange in Sydney and then
became a member of the London Stock Exchange, visits
the mine early in October.

Kalgoorlie mineowners are to pay a trifle more
for their water after September. They are now supplied
at ss. per 1000 gallons, with a rebate to 3s. 6d. in the case
of low-grade shows, and to Is. 6d. if the fluid is used for
sluicing tailings ; but as it costs the State 9s. to supply
that quantity, an increase to 7s. 3d. is commended to the
“sympathetic consideration” of the purchasers. The
latter realise that some extra charge is inevitable, because
for years past the scheme hasn’t paid anything at all
towards the statutory sinking fund ; so it is probable that
the amount so politely asked for will be handed out
without much of a murmur.

the English co., which previously owned the show,
must be sorry it didn’t hold on. The whereabouts of
several patches of ore are known to the present owners ;
but when these have been taken out the troubles will
start. Just about that time the public may be asked to
come in and share the wealth.
* * * *
Outlay still exceeds income.at the Boulder No. 1
Co.’s St. George mine (W.A.). The management reports
the discovery that by mixing hard ore from below 100 ft.
with the soft pug above this point the Ridgeway filters can
do better work ; but shareholders are dog-tired of being
buoyed up with this or that variety of encouragement,
and are beginning to ask how much longer operations are
to be carried on at a loss. As previously remarked, it
would be more sensible for the co. to give treatment best
for a time than go on dropping its bundle in this way.

A belated circular informs Australian holders
that Golden Link (W.A.) now has 80,000 tons of from 395.
to 425. ore in sight, which vigorous development is ex-
pected to increase to 120,000 tons of 40s. ore before the
end of the year. This tonnage, it is claimed, will justify
the erection of a recovery plant with a capacity of be-
tween 4000 and 5000 tons a month, and costs (including
development) are not expected to exceed 21s. 6d. to
225. 6d. per ton. The circular also states that the plant
can be completed within six months after it has been
ordered, and by the time it is ready for work a very sub-
stantial reserve of payable ore should be available. But
as this puts the treatment clock back at least twelve
months—six months to find the ore and six months to
find the plant—the shares have started to sag - .
TM on u On Western Australian Exploration,
reconstructed with a capital of £212,000
in 848,000 shares of ss. each. One new share is to be
ffnen for each of the 208,663 old £1 shares, and a similar
n jj n^ er are , to b e offered to shareholders at par. In
addition, subscribers have the right for two years to a
call at par of one additional new share in respect of each
new share taken up. This accounts for 841,989, and the
remaining 6011 shares are to be held in reserve. It is pro-
posed that shareholders should also have the right to
ap g l ;V° ran y s * lares which may not be subscribed for,
and the allotment of such surplus shares would also carry
with it the call of a further share during the currency of
the two years’ option alluded to. As already stated, the
object in raising more capital is to gamble on Chairman
Moremg s tip that there are at present golden opportuni-
ties to make money, and make it quickly.
* * * *
The death knell of the Cumberland (W. A.) is
sounded. For some years this mine helped to keep
Norseman going, but, like several other shows which
lived and died in the district, its span of life does not
extend for more than a few hundred feet below the sur-
face. The co. admits that the end is coming, and is
getting ready to go into mourning. There is still a little
money in hand, and shareholders may be asked before
long to club together and find some more so as to finance
the purchase of a new property.
* * * *
British Exploration of Westralia, Ltd., has
reduced its capital from £500,000 to £200,000 in 400,000
10s. shares, and has tacked on an assessment of 4s. per
share. Since its promotion in 1900 by A. E. Morgans, it
has never done anything to vindicate its existence, and
how shareholders came to assess themselves so heavily in
order to give it a bit more rope is not understandable.
Better have let the bank foreclose, as it seems hopeless to
expect, with the burdens it is now carrying and the in-
different prospects ahead, that it will ever pay dividends.
Black Range (W.A.), which didn’t feel very
bad before, feeis still better now that a good lens has
been picked up north of the crosscourse. When the half-
yearly report was made up (duly 26), the No. 4 level
(350 ft.) had been taken out 103 ft., the last 23ft. averaging
2ft. of stone worth 15dwt. Now, less than a month later,
the stone is sft. wide and still worth 15dwt. The deeper
levels have not gone out far enough to pierce the cross-
course ; but there is now no apparant reason why the
gold should not go down as well on the north as on the
south side of the break. The half-year gave a profit of
£20,480, after paying for all the development work
(£4483), and writing off plant depreciation (£1170), and
the £5OO paid for the Youanme option which the co.
turned down. Money spent on the Pioneer option is also
included with the expenditure. On June 30 the co. had :
Liquid assets (excluding stores) .. £20,251
Liabilities 141
Surplus £20,110
There are 72,500 shares in the present co. ; the old co. in
1905-6 paid £23,625 in divs., and the new co. has brought
up the total to £114,125, of which £16,312 was paid last
half-year. Any statement as to ore reserves wouldn’t be
worth much ; all that can be said is in a general way that
there appear to be more years ahead of the mine" than
there are at the back of it.
* * » •
The first report and accounts of the Great
Pitzroy (y.) are out. This is for the new co., formed to
succeed the one originally pushed off by G. P. Doolette
and Philip Charley. Period covered is from July 17,1908,
to June 30, 1909—nearly 12 months. The new co. took
over the whole concern and issued 374,262 shares paid to
18s. ; then 2s. was got in = £37,426. Robinson and Clark,
of London, took 25,388 shares nominally at par (£1), and
thus the co. has had £62,814 to go on with. On June 30
its financial position was—
Assets. —Stores, etc, .. ..£26,233
Cash, etc. .. .. 21,641
£47,874
Liabilities.—Sundry .. .. 4,519
Surplus £43,355
Heavy expenditure is being incurred ; so Lionel Robin-
son’s firm has been given a two years’ option over 100,000
more shares at par ; the directors may call on them to
take up 15,000 shares by the end of November. As the
market is standing up at over 255. Robinson will, no
doubt, be willing. A further 50,000 shares have been
taken by the Mac Georges, of London ; but that is since the
accounts were issued. Twq bigger furnaces and a concen-
trating mill are going up, with other plant; one furnace
is ready. Using only the old 100-ton smelter the
co.’s working account showed £16,967 profit. But
knock off £2500 for commission on new capital
issue (which means that the new 25,000 shares only
netted the co. 18s. a piece), £2299 for general exes",
£11,687 for depreciation, development, etc., and only
£5OO remains to carry forward. As to the development
account: £9672 was charged to capital, and £4565 is now
written off, leaving £5107 to be provided from future
profits. Still, this is a pretty liberal writing off, as over
600,000 tons have been added to reserves.
Great Fitzrov reserves total 981,000 tons, with
250,000 tons of “probable” ore. The ore handled was
34,261 tons ; the working account revenue equalled £2 2s.
Bd. per ton. Costs (including management, but excluding
development and depreciation) were £ll4s. per ton, leaving
Bs. Sd. profit. Costs will no doubt be reduced ; they may
possibly be brought down to 30s. per ton, including every-
thing. But the average value of the reserves appears to
be at the least 7s. 6d. per ton less than that handled
during the year. Further, when the concentrating mill
starts losses will be heavier. It is very doubtful, there-
fore, whether the reduced costs will not be more than
counterbalanced. If so, Ss. per ton is a very liberal estimate
of profits, even taking copper at £6O as a basis. 8., M.
and Co., the general managers, a while ago figured on a
“ surplus ” of £lO,OOO a month from 18,000 tons ; but that
was with copper at £6O. At £55, which is a safer figure,
about £2600 would have to come off that; and the £lO,OOO
(equal to about 11s. 2d. per ton) apparently didn’t allow
for management exes. At Bs. Bd. (last half-year’s margin)
a million tons would be worth £433,330 = 21s. Bd. per
share on the number of shares issued at the date of the
last balance.

East Mexican, Charters Towers, is sending out
two footwall crosscuts in search of a reef parallel to the
main Day Dawn. The latter was followed for 100 ft. along
the Mexican’s bottom level, which is a continuation of
No. 6in Mills’ United. The rich stone carried downwards
towards the New Brilliant Freeholds’ top level (now
known as No. 1 East) ; but apparently the good stone has
pinched out in the higher levels of the E. Mexican, for
No. 5 has failed to find anything payable, although some
good stone is being stoped further west along the level on
Mills’ United side. East Mexican’s position is most tanta-
lising ; it is practically hedged in by payable stone, which
occurs just outside its boundary. Those who hold on
believe that by extending a level along the boundary
something may be found. Even the fact that No. 5
failed to find a payable shoot doesn’t altogether damp
their hopes. The theory about a footwall reef is now
being tested by the two crosscuts.
* * * *
Cassilis, Gippsland, has a maw as wide as a
rock-cod’s. Twelve months back itembarked on a hydro-
electric scheme, necessitated by the working out of local
fuel supplies. To date, £19,000 has gone on that project,
and there still are oddments wanted—a new motor or a
new air compressor. So profits have been diverted to the
machinist or the German manufacturer. All the while
the mill has been eating up the ore reserves. These
now tot up only 9240 tons, containing 8680 oz.
On that basis the mine, with working costs at 355.,
shows £16,170 profit in sight. With a register of 60,000
shares, that is ss. 4d. per share. But £3871 is due to the
bank, and the air compressor will take another £2500
before it gets at work. Therefore, a third of the profit
is earmarked. Crosscutting is going on for the lode at
715 ft. The co. wants to hit a shoot like the one at No. 6,
but the country is very tight and the lenses of ore seem
to be hardly so persistent at depth. On the other hand,
extensions of the Cerisa and the Cassilis lodes are being
developed, so there is still a hope that the machinery man
may be paid off and a bit of profit set free for shareholders.
Good old Jubilee, of Scarsdale (Vie.)! Here it
comes with a record that smells of fat men and fat divi-
dends. Never a look back since Tom Harvey spotted the
work that the old co-operative party was doin')-. Now,
with a modest plant, it has put up a record of £132,000 in
divs., and has got down to 1600 ft., with the co. still on
what Aleoclc, true to Bendigo training, describes as
“ payable ” stone. All the same, there is a shrinkage in
the values treated, partly because the richest stone has
been already taken from the higher levels, and
partly because of the gradual impoverishment of
the lode as it goes down. Most of the share-
holders have been stickers, and as £3 13s. 6d.
has been paid per share, and the mai ket has never touched
that point, they have made money by hanging on. The
market, too, hasn’t liked to face the Baillieu cMtn-Daley-
citm-Riiey crowd, so no funn3' business has ever been
attempted with shares.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
From a man
who has been
wandering i n
the wild and
cock-eyed Nor’-
West:—
Broome, the
centre of the Wes-
tralian pearling in-
dustry, is boom-
ing. Shell is
higher than for
years past, and
the market is
steady. Pearls are
in good demand,
and surplus stocks
are said to be
practically ex-
hausted. Follow-
ing on the Monkey-
-11 ear scrimmage
and the American
financial panic,
there was a tre-
mendous slump,
and some of the
big dealers who
owned luggers
made haste to get
out of the wet.
The luggers were
bought by local
men, and now
there are over a
couple of hundred
whites in the
business, either as
full or part owners
of vessels, and as
many more are
engaged as shell-
openers. Japs and
Malays still do
the diving and
the monotonous
work of pumping
air to the man
on the ocean bed.
The only white
diver who tackled
the job was Alick
McLachlan. H e
owned a lugger
and went in for an
oil engine to work
the air pump ; but
a big blow swept
the coast, and
poor Mac lost his
lugger and his life
as well.
Broome is un-
der municipal
government, has a
fine artesian water
supply, and is not
at all a bad place
for white people
to live in. Except during- three months in the
year, splendid vegetables are raised three or four
miles out.
Carnarvon, away to the south, is growing steadily and
sturdily. It loses most of its streets after the Gascoyne
has its periodical overflow, and the local photographer
always has his camera ready for flood pictures. Onslow
is another thriving town—mostly sheep. Point Sampson
has a good jetty and lots of Indian Ocean for big steamers ;
so the little town of Cossack, which possesses neither,
will be shortly wiped out. A new town site is to be laid
out at Sampson, which will then be the port for Roe-
bourne—which might with advantage be obliterated also.
The only reason for keeping it going is the fact that
several costly public buildings were erected there many
y® ars a g°, a nd the Government doesn’t like writing them
off as a dead and total loss.
A SURER METHOD.
KIND LADY: “I am glad to see you do not use
a brutal stick to urge the poor beast, like
other cruel boys."
DRIVER: “Mo, missus. I jest screws ’is tail, an’
’e goes like billyo!"
THE MARCH OF SCIENCE
SETTLER (from the Back-of-Beyond) : “ Divil take me if ever I expected to see a
flyin' machine in this country for the next twenty year!"
Phil Harum : The naming of Long-
reach (Central Q.) streets mentioned by “Myrtle ”
(B. 29/7/’O9) was due to a streak of originality in
the surveyor who laid out the place. The same
streak was responsible for the naming of the
streets of Barcaldine. In Barcaldine we have
Oaic-street, Willow-street, Pine-street, and so on.
It is the tree town. In Ilfracombe, a smaller
settlement between Barcaldine and Long-
reach, a Yankee notion has been adopted,
and the stranger find himself in First-'
street, Second-street, Third-street, etc.
“ The Prooshan ” : A feline re-
cently deceased at Tumberumba(N.S. W.)
was a mighty cat before the Lord. He
was of the Thomas religion, and was the
property, of Mr. J. Sheppard, late
(manager of the Manus cheese factory.
There were of pure cat in Thomas.
His owner left the milk or cream around
Tom’s beat without the least fear of the
animal touching it; for he was a remark -
ably honest cat, as well as a champion
mouser. He was also a great rabbi ter—
in fact, he was the best rabbit-cat in the
country, and accompanied his master on
hunting expeditions. Mr. Sheppard kept
a couple of ferrets, and after slipping
these two ultimatums into the mouth of
the burrow, the string net was applied
over the entrance. In a short time the
rabbit exodus began, and when the junior
rabbits came along and wriggled out
through the net, Thomas, the cat, was in
his glory. He was a swift retriever or
fieldscat, and did great work in the
scrum. He has been known to run simul-
taneously ten different ways after the
same number_of young rabbits, and catch
them all. No more numerous cat was
known in these parts. His owner refused
£5 for him, and his untimely end per
steel trap was much regretted.
“Moorabinda” : I am glad “Zola ” put
in a good word for the parson in his pur (B.
12/8/’O9) when giving evidence on the other side
of the question re the Australian and his alleged
‘‘tired feeling.” A great many city folk think
that the parson’s job is all beer and honey. Per-
haps it is when said parson has but one congregu-
tion to minister to, as is usual in city churches.
But it is a different matter when the case of the
country parson comes to be considered. I am
personally acquainted with a minister who was in
charge of a certain N.S.W. (Methodist) “Home
Mission Station.” This minister was (and his
successor is) responsible for an area covering 6000
square miles, and as he had no local preachers to
assist him (a very common predicament Outback),
the order of the day was travelling. The work
was especially hard for the last 12 months of his
ministry, owing to a severe drought which made
travelling difficult. The carrying of horse feed was
imperative. A brief sketch of his monthly
“Bogan trip” will describe the situation. He
was seen on the track early (in order to be at
Wyoming—s 6 miles by unformed roads—in time
for service at 7.30 p.m.), jogging along in a sulky
loaded with horse feed, wallet, and water-bag.
About 30 miles were passed over before the halt
on the banks of the Bogan. Very soon after the
halt, the missionary might be seen seated in the
best shade to be found in the Nyngan district, not
far from a camp-fire, with billy on one side, lunch
on the other, and a paper (or perhaps sermonical
notes) on his knees. Here in solitude he waited
until his nag had emptied her feeding bottle;
then on to Wyoming. Next day he went to
Burdenda. Tottenham, Lansdale, and Summer-
lea occupied another three days. The parson
landed home on the Saturday ready (?) for
Sunday in Nyngan. This work went on,
3ear in and year out, winter and summer.
And summer at Nyngan often means about 118° in
the shade. Country parsons are, as a rule, fairly
good bushmen, and manage to avoid an all night
out, although the parson I speak of, through no
HS own > nearly had that experience.
Whilst travelling some 50 miles from home,
lopsy, the nag, took sick and pegged out within
ten minutes, leaving the parson and his wife (who
often made the long Bogan trip with her husband)
16 miles from a house. That distance had to be
tramped under a heavy load in the moonlight.
Another experience was driving for scores and
scores of miles over black plain country in water
about two feet deep. And yet that Methodist
didn t grumble at his ill-paid lot. Again in the
very hilly district of Nundle (N.8.W.) another
parson friend thinks nothing of travelling 100
miles or so each week of the year, per bike, horse
and Shanks’s pony. And I could quote dozens of
cases to prove conclusively that our Australian
country clerics, at least, are not often afflicted
with that tired feeling—but of course there are
loafing sheep in every flock.
* * * *
“Flinderino ” : It is not very uncommon
on the far northern (Q.) rivers to see two crocodiles
having a willing fight. Usually it is the she croc’
attacking the bull croc’ for eating too jnany
baby diles. Old dad has a bad habit of chew-
ing up newly-hatched youngsters, and the enraged
mother resents the unfatherly conduct. But if all
the saurians that are successfully hatched were
allowed to grow up, all the rivers and creeks of
North Australia wouldn’t hold them. A neighbor
of mine is rearing some infant saurians with the
object of one day touring the world with a team
of performing crocodiles. He has a poultry farm
near a creek, and the little crocodiles used to come
along a guttering he had made between the poul-
try yard and the creek. They’d come up to steal
chickens and ducks. Although they were scarcely
a foot long, they would show fight when caught,
and if you didn’t grab them close to the head,
they d grab you. He keeps them in wired boxes,
containing two kerosene tins cut down lengthwise.
One tin holds water, the other straw or sawdust,
omall birds and pieces of goat flesh are put in for
tucker. Croc’ junior, like his old man, prefers his
food extremely dead ; so he plants the tucker in
the corners of the box until it fills the neighbor-
hood with its howls for deep burial.
CONFUSING.
THE KID : “ Who are those men over there,
Daddy?"
OLD JUMBUCK : “ Shearers , my dear—men shear-
ing the sheep.”
THE KID : “ Daddy , you're fooling me. You
said last night that the damned ungrateful
dogs had started shearing again.”
“Lantana ” : A swagwoman is not a very
common happening-, but a few days ago an old
travelling lady of 80, accompanied by her grand-
son, a youth of 17, passed through Moree
N.S.W.). The boy led a degenerate horse on
whose back wobbled their pack. They had no
tent, possessed only a blanket a-piece, and the one
night they spent at Moree was passed under a
tree. I had a yarn with the old lady, and she told
me that her husband died many years ago, leaving
her nearly destitute, with half a dozen kiddies.
They had all grown up and made homes for them-
selves, but had left the old mother to shift around
on foot. She spoke lightly of tackling a walk of
25 miles next day, and said she “ had some notion
of settling down with her grandson,” that young
person having offered to retrieve the intervening
generation’s shortcomings by supporting her for
the rest of her days.

From a
man in the
North :
The decision
of the Austra-
lian Estates,
Ltd., to put up
bovril and boil-
ing-down and
freezing works
at Wynd ham
(W. A.) recalls a
few older ex-
periments.
In 1901, Mr.
Nieman, a Mel-
bourne chemist,
after having- a
yarn with Cap-
tain Bradshaw,
of the Victoria
River, formed a
syndicate to ex-
tract beef, and
took a plant up
to Port Dar-
w i n. Fro ni
there the party,
consisting- of
Nieman, his
wife and family,
an engineer and
four men, pro-
ceeded by lug-
ger ; but they
were wrecked
at Port Keats
through mi s-
taking the
entrance of the
Fitzmaurice for
the Victoria.
The lugger re-
mained on the
mud for five
weeks, and was
then towed off
by the Wai-Hoi.
The party had
an anxious ex-
perience, being
watched by the
blacks all' the
time. The Port
Keats’ blacks,
it may be men-
tioned, are the
worst savages
in the North ;
two years ago
they murdered
Bradshaw and
three w h i te
men. Nieman,
however, pu t
fear into their
hearts by exploding- some dynamite amongst them
when once they got too close. When the party
ultimately got to the Victoria Nieman found he could
only buy bullocks at £4 a head, instead of the 80s. that had
been mentioned ; so after a few months the business was
abandoned, and Nieman quietly settled down in Palmer-
ston, a poorer but a wiser man.
In 1886 a syndicate was formed to boil down buffalo on
the Adelaide River. At that time there must have been
about 50,000 there; so plentiful were-they that Paddy
Cahill’s tally for a month’s shooting ran into a thousand
head. This scheme, however, never came to anything.
Some five years ago the indomitable Bradshaw floated
the East African and Australian Cold Storage Co., which
commenced operations at Arafura, and put up buildings,
etc., at Blue Mud Bay, in the Arafura Sea. The object
was to extract bovril and ship frozen beef. The co. held
20,000 square miles ; but the coastal country is unfit for
cattle. All the cattle have been removed from Arafura
and Hodgson Downs.
The Victoria River and adjacent country, where the
new co. is to work, is magnificent grazing land. Nearly
the lot is held by the Kidmans, Forrests, Emanuels,
Buchanans, Duracks, and Copley and Patterson. There
are also a few “ cookies ”on 100,000-acre patches. A few
years ago a strip of country between Hall’s Creek and
Wyndham was cut up and thrown open for selection.
Cattle were plentiful on the Ord, Sturt and Margaret, and
all a man had to do was to put up a yard. All some of
the selectors possessed was a few horses. Now they
have nice herds of cattle. The Territory is the only
place left for this game. The Victoria, Macarthur
and the tablelands are still good places wherein
to pick up a tidy mob of clean skins. Two
men on the Victoria “ sat down ” on a billa-
bong with a bullock-waggon. In two years they
had 600 cattle. In Darwin they used to say the
bullocks had five calves a year.
* * * *.
“Bushman,” from the Atherton big-
scrub (Q.) :
Re bush-felling, I contend that “ Janor”(B. 13/5/’O9) is
quite right, and most of his racy critics quite wrong.
Throughout the North Coast of N. S. Wales, the whole of
the coastal districts of Queensland, and also the whole of
the timbered portion of Maoriland, the bush consists of a
heavy forest of large trees growing up through a dense
undergrowth of small shrubs, vines, etc., with the addi-
tion of supplejacks in M.L. To clear the land in those
places you cut all the small undergrowth, vines, etc.,
with a slasher (or scrub-hook); this is “vining” in
N.S.W., “brushing” in Queensland, and “underserub-
bing”inM.L. The large timber is then felled out of a
face ; sometimes in M.L. it is felled up to a certain size ;
whilst in the other places mentioned fig trees (Moreton
Bay fig) are left standing; and in the northern parts of
Queensland the Johnstone hardwood is also left. This is
the work to which “Janor” rightly gives the
palm for “exhilaration.” I have tried many ways
of earning beer—farm work in all its branches, butcher-
ing,_ carpentering (bush), navvying (from ganger down),
engine-driving (stationary, traction, portable and loco-
motive), mining, kauri gum digging, timber getting,
splitting and others ; and I unhesitatingly vote for bush-
felling. You need both brain and muscle if you are to
succeed at it; the strongest man or the best axeman
isn’t necessarily the best bush-feller. Good judgment in
“driving” is worth more than physical strength.
(“ Driving ” is the making use of falling trees to assist in
felling others.) The judgment is required, in the first
place, to sufficiently kerf (why do bushmen use the
carpenter’s term “scarf ”?) the front tree or trees, so that
the back one or ones will drive them without hanging up
in them ; and yet you don’t want to waste work by
kerfing more than necessary. And, in the second place,
you need judgment to so adjust the kerfs in the driving
trees that they will strike the front ones in the right
place. In flat country there are never any very large
drives; but in hilly country it is different.' There the
trees, growing one above the*other up the hillside, branch
out towards the light, thus overbalancing them down hill.
(Unobservant bush men assert “ the valleys draw i he trees”
to explain why they almost in variably fall in that direction.)
The writer, on one occasion, in Hawkes Bay Province
(M.L.), assisted to work up a drive, in which 49 large
trees, mostly mountain ratas, were felled at the one time ;
and, as the drive went without a hitch, it was a most exhila-
rating experience. Given favorable conditions, hilly
country for drives, calm weather (wind always makes
bushfeiling dangerous), and bush free from vines (these
bind the tops of trees together and often cause them to
swing around in the wrong direction), and bushfelling is
one of the cleanest, healthiest, and most exhilarating of
all avocations, even if it is also one of the riskiest.

“F.C.” gets more advice concerning his
shade-tree :
“ F.C.” feels inclined to try the Moreton Bay chestnut
(B. 15/7/’O9). If he has any stock that he values he won’t.
Nearly all the year round it is dropping beans, and these
the stock eat, for the vegetable has something enticing
about it after the manner of opium or Darling pea.
The cattle either die of dysentery, or the chewed
beans form into a solid mass and kill
them. “ F.C.’s ” first choice, the Queensland sugar-gum
(rusticus curlibus), is, as its name implies, a purposeless sort
of a thing, being only useful for staining the ground
underneath it, and restarting bush fires any time up to
six months after they have apparently burned themselves
out.
PROVIDED FOR.
BIGG ; "He used to talk of becoming a great actor."
LITTLE: “ Yes, but it wasn't necessary. He married his landlady!"
“Starfish” : “F.C. ” asks (8., 15/7/’O9) for
further,information rc shade trees. Let me draw
his attention to the Naval Washington orange tree.
It gives good shade, grows big rapidly, lives
long, is evergreen, and moreover is a pro-
ducer of goods. The best for quick growth
and foliage is the seedling, which attains a good
shade-giving size in about 15 years; but for rapid-
ity of fruit producing the budded plant comes
first. A seedling gives fruit in about seven
years, a grafted tree in three or four, but the
latter do not “stay” (i.e. produce fruit) as long
as the former. Buds are big enough to put
their hair up in 20 years. They are not so'
elegant or thick in foliage as seedlings, which
grow so dense that the centre branches require
pruning to let in the light and air. Suckers
should always bo removed, as they are mostly
wood and sap the life of the tree. Otherwise,
orange trees need little or no pruning. Another
ad vantage of this tree is that, when it wants water,
it says so. It makes a sign. Its leaves begin to
curl up. The trees thrive best in sandy or loose
soil, and are ill-adapted for mineral, clayey, or
salty ground.
“Portite”: In your issue (5/8/’O9)
“ Whaffor ” was responsible for some uncalled-
for and absolutely misleading statements about
Port Macquarie. This celebrity stated that a
haul of 250 schnapper was made on the pilot
boat. The pilot crew has very little time to
spare, and never goes fishing, though the town
has two small steamers engaged in the schnap-
per and crayfishing business. “ Whaffor ” says
that the bar is bad. Well, vessels drawing up
t° 10ft. cross in and out night and day, so it
is not too bad. As to the ancient cemetery
becoming covered wdth lantana, that is
not true. The story about the ungodly
playing euchre in the horse-boxes in the
Anglican church is an unadulterated lie,
and needs no comment. The local people
waxed furious over this slur upon their
spiritual character, and swear that the
next time “ Whaffor ” presents his yellow
countenance at the Port he will be bom-
barded with schnapper heads, old mullet,
oyster shells, and boiled crayfish. Ah
Chin, our local cabbage-raiser, has been
blamed by some for the paragraph, but I
really believe our heathen vegetarian is too
honest to lie in that fashion.
“Jimmie Pannikin: Once, outside Bar-
ringun, near the Queensland border, T overheard
a proposal of marriage. The ladies were getting
their seoond wind, while the gents were having a
drink and a draw and a spit, as the Chester-
fieldian M.C. put it. I was studying moonlight
effects in a patch of shadow when the pair stopped
close to me. Said the m. n, “Look here, Liz, I
arsked ya out here to say a few words ta ya. I
want ya ta marry me. Ev course, ya young, and
I’m much older ; but I’ve looked after meself.
I m quite as spry as the best o’ th’ young blokes.
Look at the property I got. I have 3000 wethers
on me back, 450 head a cattle on me front flats,
8000 lambing ewes on me middle front, a seven-
roomed house and garden on me front back, a
hundred head ev horses on me middle back, a
coupler thousand quid in th’ bank, not a cronk
tooth in me head, the best beard Back-o’-Bourke,
and I love ya like blazes. Will yer marry me,
Liz, next month?” A stray camel from the
Afghan camp came tearing through the lygorum,
and three people fled back to the ballroom and
safety. Did Liz marry the man ? Ido not know.
HOW WE SAVED AUSTRALIA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Australia rose in anger,
And then sat down in fear,
When first the cry came surging,
“ The flaming Japs are here.”
Then Sosh and Anti-Soshite
Joined in a mighty shout,
“ Call, ere we all are murdered,
Our brave boy-soldiers out.”
Our colonel had been waxing
His whiskers since the dawn ;
But the cadets he marshalled
Upon the croquet lawn.
“ My lads,” said he unto us,
“ Great work is ours to-day ;
The whole world’s eyes are on us.”
We loudly said, “ ’Ooray 1 ”
Th 're were just fourteen of us—
Bill Smith had hurt his thumb.
His mother wrote explaining
That William couldn’t come.
We shed a tear for Billy
And his ill-timed mishap,
And, ’midst a blast of cheering,
Went forth to meet the Jap.
With all due ceremony
We formed a hollow square ;
Whatever else was lacking,
The hollowness was there.
Our colonel stood before us ;
He smiled a scornful smile
Upon those brown invaders
Who gazed on us the while.
“ Come on ! ” then loud we shouted,
“ O soldiers of Japan.”
They wavered for an instant,
And then in haste they ran
To where their boats were riding
Upon the swelling tide ;
And as they climbed aboard them,
“’Ooray 1 ’Ooray ! ” we cried.
The thirst of blood us urging,
We chased our fleeting foe
Eight down unto the ocean,
And sadly watched him go.
Then spake our gallant colonel :
“ The sight of us, my men.
Has quite demoralised them ;
They’ve gone back home again.”
Tnen cityward we carried
Our colonel, shoulder high—
Our pretty, gold-laced colonel,
Who’d sworn to do or die.
And when we met our people,
Oh, how the cheers did ring !
And all joined in together
And sang “God Save the King ! ”
They took us to the panto,;
We had a glorious night;
They toasted us in sherbet—
“ The heroes of the fight.”
Meanwhile the Japs went rushing
Across the deep blue sea.
’Twas thus we saved Australia
In the brave days to be.

T.C.K.: Yarn re transcontinental railway rather
scrappy. As two points among many: (1) What
do you know re the southern-central part of the
Territory (your talk is all about Palmerston)? (2)
What do you know about Gregory North (lately
described by the local Rabbit Board as “ the driest
part of Australia”) and Gregory South (Q.), and the
Broken Hill district (N.S. W.), through which you want
to divert the line?....W. G. Jay : Whenever a one-time
Democrat “ rats,” there are always fools of the wise-after-
the-event class to write “ What do you think of your
friend now?” The simple remedy is to denounce and
oppose everybody', and then you never fall in through
anybody' “ ratting." So we start by calling vou a bigoted,
bloated and ignorant Tory. Thus, when you “ rat,”
we won’t have made any mistake; and if .you die
without “ratting,” we will say that y'ou would have
“ratted” if you had lived long enough E. A.
Phipson: You are quite wrong in s vying that this
paper is “gradually coming to see tha/a tax on land
values is even more important than a ,ariff on foreign
goods.” But we have got a very fair, though far from
perfect, tariff, and we haven’t yet got a graduated land-
tax, so the latter looms up more conspicuously nowa-
days. In the same way the English clamor more loudly
now for cheap cablegrams than for Magna Oharta, simple
because they have got Magna Charta. No ra\.i

Equity: “What were the dead man’s wishes?” Weil,

The price of your commodities
Will be arbitrated for ;
You will know then what you have to pay r ,
And he will have a law
For the house landlord and tenant,
Which will be just and fair.
The rents will then not be too high
Nor the tenements too bare.
Not even your hero, Hogg, of Maoriland, can stand
having such poetry as that written about him..
J.M.L. : “Solace” good in spots, but the spots

your old humor-level Pir irroo : Item too belated
R. J. O'L. : You do build the lengthy' rhyme—l9ft. (over
6yds.) to a line. Also, past May' mornings and dead
highwaymen aren’t worth poetry of these dimensions
M.A.: “Dull prose” would befit your “homewardly”

TO REGAIN CORRECT WAIST
MEASUREMENT.
The Appeoved Method.
To begin with, what you most certainly must
not do, if you are too fat, is subject your constitu-
tion to the strain of violent exercising or go in for
starving the body down to normal weight. Such
treatments will pull you down for a time, but will
make you look limp, unhealthy, wrinkled, and
prematurely old. The approved method requires
no sacrifice of comforts and enjoyments. The
only special effort you need make is to go to, or
send to, your chemist and get him to make up the
following prescription :—One half-ounce of Mar-
mola, one ounce of fluid extract of Glycvrrhiza
8.P., one ounce of pure Glycerine 8.P., and three
and a half ounces of Peppermint Water. Of this
harmless mixture take a dose of two teaspoonfuls
after each meal and at bedtime, without departing
from your ordinary habits. You will not only
quickly regain correct waist measurement, but all
traces of superfluous fat will soon disappear with-
out leaving a wrinkle ; neither will there be any
flabbiness, because there will be a re-development
of muscular fibre. This simple, healthy treatment
will do you lasting good in every way.*
PERSONAI
ITEMS
Theodore Martin died last week, aged 92,
and the cable reported his decease as that of a
well-known author. Formerly he was known as
the husband of Helen Faucit, a famous actress of
the old stilted school, whom he married in 1851.
Helen Faucit took the fancy of Queen Victoria
(she always had a leaning to “respectable” lady
mummers), and it was through his wife’s acquaint-
ance with the Queen that Theodore Martin
became a sort of literary-man-in-waiting at Court.
He got the job of writing the “ Life of the Prince
Consort” and the “Life of Lord Lyndhurst,” a
bigoted Tory who led the opposition to Parlia-
mentary reform during the first years of Victoria’s
reign. His last book was “ Queen Victoria as I
Knew Her,” into which the aged courtier put
almost as much butter as was expected.
ALICK PEACOCK , OF VICTORIA,
AS HE IS TO-DAY.
By the Oldest Inhabitant :
Re the death of Martin Hood, of Melbourne, that very
a<fed teetotaller who managed a brewery. There is this
to be said m his favor, that he managed the brewery that
brewed the worst beer in the State. His employer’s bad
beer and bad management of a very bad system of tied
houses led to his downfall. Even a teetotaler is justified
in managing a brewery when the brewery brews such
bad beer that people would sooner drink out of a
waterhole.
N.S.W. ex-Justice W. J. Foster, recently
dead, was educated chiefly at Cheltenham College
(England) and Trinity College (Dublin). At the
former institution, a schoolmate of his was the
late Justice C. J. Manning. At Trinity, Darley
and Owen also received their education. Trinity
College, Dublin, seems to have a contract to
supply N.S.W. with Judges—good, bad and in-
different.
Ex-Justice W. J. Foster (“ Water Jug”),
of N. S. Wales, wasn’t the favorite at the Bar
that this generation might judge from the
Acting-Chief’s buttery panegyric the other
day. “This is a matter in which common-
sense must be used,” he told a Sydney jury
in 1888, “and a jury is more competent to
deal with it than lawyers would be.” Long
before there was any talk of “ the unwritten
law ” Foster adopted it; once on circuit, a
man having been found guilty of shooting
another for philandering with the missus, he
sentenced him to three minutes’ gaol—or it
might have been five ; this writer disremem-
bers. Anyhow, the prisoner was out of the
court before the Judge was. Foster was only
on the Bench six years; but he drew his
pension steadily for 15 years afterwards. The
illness which drove him off the Bench was so
gradual, in fact, that G. B. Simpson, who
stepped into his shoes, is now the senior
Judge; and “G. 8.” himself will probably
retire in a year or so. The late Judge’s
mother was a niece of the Duke of Welling-
ton’s wife.
Sfcarchbishop Clarke, of Melbourne, is
now dreadfully worried about the continued
vacancy of the New Guinea billet, lately
discarded by Stone-Wigg. It carries a salary
of only £3OO a year; and his Grace despairs
of getting a man at the price. As the
Church insists that Ah Chow is a brother,
and that the color of his skin doesn’t count
once he is inside the fold, what about
offering the billet to one of the Chinese
missionaries? Other white workers in the North
have had to submit to brown and yellow competi-
tion on the ground that the work wouldn’t run to
white wages; and it seems a fair thing now
that the Bishop profession should also find out
how it feels.
According to a cable from London, Win-
ston Churchill’s appearance in the Commons at
the end of an all-night sitting, “in slippers,
Pyjamas and overcoat, caused merriment and pro-
tests from the Ooposition.” Yet Churchill is
only a plagiarist; 16 years ago George Dibbs,
summoned hastily from his bed to attend a divi-
sion in the N.S.W. Assembly, appeared with even
less than that on. Australia has supplied the
world with many great ideas for which it has got
little thanks, and the fact that Britain has bor-
rowed without acknowledgment our plan of
having undressed Ministers at divisions is only in
keeping with all the rest. Australia, by the way,
has had at least one disguised Minister at a divi-
sion a.s well as an undressed one. He wasn’t so
disguised that his friends didn’t know him, but he
didn’t know himself. He said his name was
“ Hiccup.”
The late Samuel Hordern outlived brother
Anthony by 23 years. Brother Anthony had a
turn for enterprise and high finance. Sam’s con-
fidence was centred on Sydney and the great
Haymarket business. Anthony’s eye was fixed on
Westralia. The elder brother’s aim was to run
the West as Cecil Rhodes wished to exploit
Matabeleland. He conceived the idea of the land-
grant railway from Albany to Beverley (234
miles),and contracted to construct it in considera-
tion of 12,000 acres in alternate blocks for every
mile of rail. Also he was to introduce 5000 immi-
grants, at the rate of 1000 a year. He was buried
at Albany, just a month before Governor Broome’s
wife turned the first sod.
“Sr”: I know a member of Vic. Leg.
Assembly who, struggle as he will, can’t get over
his nervousness. He is a well-read man and a
skilful scribbler, but it is out of order for a mem-
ber to read his speech, and so the poor wretch
suffers agonies. Determined, however, that his
constituents shall not suffer, he writes letters to
himself, and when he overcomes the horror of
standing up and making a catch at the Speaker’s
eye, he has a sheaf of letters in his shaking hand.
Mostly the constituent’s letter is an ungraceful,
wooden thing; but these communications are to
the point and are backed up by terse argument.
Other members wonder at the general knowledge
of this member’s numerous correspondents. Little
by little he is breaking himself in ; but for some
time yet he will probably have to write to himself
and tell himself that he is his own obedient servant.
“Jean Sibi,” in a tone of reproach :
Truly the Labor member has to walk a chalk-line if he
hopes to escape the Fat Man’s reproach. An eye is ever
upon him, and if he gets drunk only once and has crayfish
in his hair he is liable to get two columns of publication,
with large headings that would do justice to an earth-
quake. Take, for instance, the case of King- O’Malley.
He owns some small houses at Oollingwood. They are
probably too small, and certainly the yards are too
small. Still, he didn’t build them—he only bought
them, and he probably can’t afford to pull them down.
The houses are no smaller than they would have been
if O’Malley hadn’t bought them, and thev are a good
deal cleaner and in better order, for O’lfalley spent
£BOO on cleaning and repairs, which apparently the
previous owner didn’t. Nevertheless, a Tory paper
drew attention to O’Malley’s sins in a leading articie
and Parson Woodfull spoke publicly of him by name,
and alluded to his houses, and hinted that this wasn’t
the sort of thing one might expect from one “supposed
to be a friend of the workers.” Be it noted that the
good kind preacher didn’t mention the name of the
man who built the possibly lamentable houses and let
them get out of repair—only that of the man who
bought them and spent a lot of money on making them
habitable. The kind preacher, in fact, doesn’t seem to
make a practice of mentioning the landlord’s name
unless he is a Labor man, and then only if it is an
inferior property. His apparent reason is that O’Malley
is “ supposed to be a friend of the workers,” so it
appears that he doesn’t mention the name of the pious
church-going owner of slum property, because that
person is fully understood to be an enemy of the
workers. As an enemy of the workers, he possibly has
a claim upon the sympathy and forbearance of Wood-
full. Yes, as I already mentioned, the Labor man
requires to walk a chalk-line.
One George Stiff permanently lost such
suppleness as remains to a man after 80 years of
existence, at North Botany last week. The event
recalls that only one member of the Stiff family
has hitherto earned anything like immortality. It
was a namesake of the deceased who supplied
London Punch with its well-known counsel to
those about to marry. For the one word “Don’t”
this most famous of Stiffs received a cheque for
£5.
ANY PORT IN A FUSION.
Mr. M'Dougall (Vic.) inquired whether the Prime
Minister believed Dalgety to be a better site than
Canberra for the Federal capital, and, if so, whether the
Prime Minister was committed to stand by Canberra.
Mr. Deakin answered that such personal questions were
undesirable. —Daily paper.

“ Charlie ” Harris, who passed over at
South Yarra (Vie.) the other day, was no great
orb in the tirinainent, but he was a useful citizen
all the same. For 15 years he was secretary of
the Saddlers’ Union, and for as long or longer was
Secretary of the Eight Hours Committee, besides
being president of the Trades Hall and other
things. Twice the party ran him for the (State
Assembly, and once he only missed a seat by 11
votes.
Way Lee, South Australia’s most con-
spicuous Chinaman, died last week. He was in the
tea, cracker and general dry-goods line, and years
ago carried on a guerilla war with old Henry Parkes.
Way, by virtue of his long residence in S. Aus.,
reckoned he ought to have the right to wander all
over the continent, but Parkes banged the
N.S.W. door in his face. Subsequently
he had some sort of a revenge—or thought
he had. He had a branch business in Broken
Hill, and in his premises, or very close to it, a fire
started, which 18or 20vears ago wiped out a quarter
of the main street. The police never got to the
bottom of it; but Way Lee shouted across the
border that he knew where it started, and why,
and he would give the information if he
was admitted into N. S. Wales. Probably he
didn’t know ; but he sacked one of his local repre-
sentatives all the same.
Count Mastai-Ferretti, who afterwards
became Pope Pius IX., and Miss Letitia Foster,
aunt of the late ex-Justice Foster, of N.S.W.,
figured in much picturesque gossip for quite a
heap of years. Indeed, until the lady died, in 1852,
making the tnen young “Water Jug’’her heir,
the story was common property in Cork, Clogher’
Kilmore, and other spots where her father was
the Anglican bishop. Count Mastai-Ferretti was
in the army before he took to religion, and he and
Miss Letitia are credited with having liked one
another so well that a marriage day was named.
The rest of the tale is fragmentary, for the lady
bolted from home, or, as the family put it, “dis-
appeared.” Later she reappeared. Pius IX.,
when Pope, extended special marks of favor and
consideration to members of the Foster family
who visited Rome. The lady referred to was the
Bishop’s fifth daughter. She ultimately married
barrister John Henry North, a brilliant member
of the Irish Bar, but died childless. This fact
accounted for her kindness to nephew “ Water
Jug.” The full story of that disappearance from
home was never told.
Be a deceased ex-Judge :
Ex-N.S.VV. Supreme Court Justice Foster, who died the
other day, was one of several cousins of some consequence
in Australia. John Foster (afterwards Foster Vesey Fitz-
gerald) was twice Colonial Secretary, and once' (1854)
Acting-Governor of Victoria ; William*Foster Stawell was
Chief Justice of Victoria ; William Fane de Salis was
Chairman of Directors of the P. & O. Co. ; and Leopold
Fane de Salis was a member of N.S.W. Legislative Council.
“Water Jug” Foster came from the law and church
branch of the family. His uncle was Baron Foster, of
the Irish Exchequer ; his grand-uncle was Speaker Fos-
ter of the Irish House of Commons, afterwards Baron
Oriel; his great grandfather was Anthony Foster Chief
Baron of the Irish Exchequer. Then there were John
Foster, Chief Justice of Common Pleas (Ireland), Sir
Bobert Foster, Chief Justice of England ; while ano’ther
ancestor was Chief Justice Fortescue, of England. All
this is about as bewildering as an indenture of conveyance
Then there’s the Church. W.J.’s father was a rector and
his grandfather a bishop. The latter’s uncle was the first to
husband the famous Duchess of Devonshire. Uncles on
the ex-Judge’s mother’s side were the Duke of Wellington
and Commander Sir Edward M. Pakennam. Further, the
departed pensioner claimed descent from royalty in
several ways and directions. The late lamented was
geometrically featured. His head was a circle ; his fore-
head was a square ; from ear to ear, and from ears to chin
he was an equilateral triangle ; his mouth and brows were
straight lines.; his nose was an isosceles triangle with the
bridge as the base; and his eyes were points. He
looked benign as butter, and his voice was soft as a" girl’s.
He was lithe and little, demure and detailed, gentle and
deprecating. He was precise as a sheet of postage
stamps, and perfunctory as a church verger. His chief
characteristics were sobriety, a keen scent for safety-
piety, unctuousness, alertness, and a habit of licking his
lips. In home life he was ideal; in pious circles he was
saintly. His conscience was ever easy. He drew about
£55,000 from the Treasury one way and another—mostly
another. J

At a meeting of supporters of ex-Premier
Tom Bent, held at Brighton (Vic.) one night last-
week, an enthusiastic admirer of the old meddler
and muddler seized the opportunity to get off this;
most astounding sentiment: “Mr. Bent’s good:
name is unstained. He is like One who was held
to have done no wrong, but the Jews saidl
‘Crucify Him!’ and He was led away.” The
comparison of old land-boom Bent with the author
of the Sermon on the Mount is the last possibility
in the amazing career of the globular Cabbage
King.
THE DIVISION.
While the claims of the States were not ignored, the
importance of the Federal concerns was emphasised to an
extent that made State matters seem small alongside of
them. —Premier Murray, of Victoria.
THE MICROBE : “’ Strewth, look at the greedy cow!
’E eats more than I do!”
“ Oby,” apropos of some recent events :
The scene which took place in the N.S.W. Assembly
when W. J. Foster was diddled out of his first chance of
a Supreme Court Judgeship was lively, scandalous and
recriminatory. It was all the worse from the fact that
the principal actors were cordially disliked by everybody
who listened to their accusations. Foster was penurious
and selfish. Parke*,was a toady, a schemer and a pre-
varicator, yet with streaks of greatness. Alfred Stephen
had engineered the Supreme Court billet for his slim,
tired andapparentiysickly son. Poorold “ Water Jug” !
he always looked old and emaciated —had certainly been
promised that Judgeship ; but he was borne down by beef
and multitudes. Still, he got his billet later on and made
a very poor fist of it.

Kin" Alfonso greatly prides himself upon his prowess
with the chafing dish. He will often toss up an omel tat
the royal table. This is his Majesty’s recipe : Fry in
butter little shredded pieces of chicken until they are
well browned. Then remove, and after turning the
whisked eggs in the pan, place the chicken upon them,
just as the omelet is turning. —News Item.
In olden days a king
Had for his tools of trade
A sceptre and a ring ;
(Not eggs the fowls had laid).
In olden days the lord
, Of any fair domain
Knew how to use a sword,
And carve his foes in twain.
The kitchen he despised,
And roundly cursed the cook
When dishes that he prized
The groaning plank forsook.
He chased the deer for sport,
And dragged it by the tail
Back to the lighted court
Where flowed the good, brown ale.
Then fled the varlet cooks
And fell the beast upon
With carving knives and hooks
To make it venison.
My Lord would often rise
From out his council seat,
To gallop with loud cries
After the morning’s meat.
But as for juggling pots
With broken hen-fruit crammed
Instead of brewing plots :
A king would see you d d.
The varlets for a song
These lowly duties did ;
When anything went wrong
They climbed a tree or hid.
Each to his job did look,
And in mid-air he’d swing
Who’d say he’d found a cook
Where he had sought a king.

1. THE SHAWLS, MONS MEG CAVE. 2. IN THE TEMPLE OF BAAL
3. STALAGMITES, ORIENT CAVE.
For many years before the advent of the motor-car, Mount
victoria, the last of the Blue Mountain stations proper, was
the celebrated starting point for the 36 miles coach journey
to the Wonder Caverns at Jenolan. Nowadays it divides
honors with Blackheath, Medlow Bath, and Katoomba,
which centres are frequently made the starting point for a
riin by motor to these sUbterrafieart mftrVels. After having
seen the Wonderful canyon scenery of the Blue Mountains,
and viewed the series of magnificent gorges from dizzy
heights, and having tramped along rustic paths by ferny
glens and babbling cascades, the visitor makes for the
Caves, as a sort of grand finish to his tour on the mountains*
The unparalleled attractions of this famous Caves system
will be enhanced by the new cave, the “ Temple of Baal,"
which is to be opened at any early date. Its chief central
feature is a splendid chamber with the height stnd majesty
of Milan Cathedral, and a richness of mural decoration
which is unsurpassed by any known at Jenolan. There
are some exceedingly novel incidents in the corridors and
passages of this cave, among them being a complete though
miniature representation of an earthquake. The elongated
fissure in the surface, with its attendant disruption of the
surrounding earth, being plainly visible, While its caUso-=>
the subsidence of the bed of the Underground river—i§
clearly shown in sections. The cave has been Well protected,
and the interior work includes a number of stairways and
passages, which make it safe and comfortable. The eiectrie
light is being carried to the dome of the big chamber, in order
that its massive proportions might be clearly discernible.

SCIENCE SPEAKS.
In the treatment of any wound or sore, you
must not disregard the facts revealed’ bv
scientific investigation. To heal speedily and
permanently it is essential to cleanse the affected
tissues and remove any poisonous element that
may be present. The part must then be so
soothed and vitalised that Nature can restore it
at once.
To accomplish this result, an ointment must be
used which, in its action while allaying all
irritation, penetrates to the underlying tissues
and purifies thoroughly.
Chase’s Universal Ointment is recognised as
the most unfailing preparation for the treatment
of cuts, wounds, bruises, etc., and skin
diseases in cases of long standing.
This famous Ointment is now manufactured in
Australia, and will b* sent post paid to any
address upon receipt of price—3/6.
Please note— Chase’s Universal Ointment is
always supplied in glass jars to avoid contact
with metal.

RHEUMATIC VICTIMS
O
A Way to Cure the Trouble-
some Complaint*
#
Drive the Cause of Rheumatism
out of Your System—This Man
did and was Cured.
You can reason this out for yourself if you are
a rheumatic sufferer. If you had a splinter in
your hand that caused a festering sore, you
wouldn’t rub an ointment or something else’on it,
expecting a cure. You would remove the splinter
—the cause of the trouble ; then the sore would
heal. Now if you have lactic acid in your blood
that causes torturing, burning rheumatism, what
chance has a liniment or something rubbed on to
cure ? None whatever. It’s the cause you must
remove, remember that.
The question of curing rheumatism is then a
question of driving the acid out of vour blood.
You’ll suffer a long time before you find anything
like Dr. Williams’ Pills for rheumatism. Why
they are for the blood. They tone the whole sys-
tem to a point that enables it to expel the rheu-
matic poison through the natural channels of the
body. The following case of a man who suffered
with rheumatism and was cured proves their
value in this complaint.
“For years I suffered off and on from rheu-
matism,” said Mr. August Freidrieh, of Burra,
S. A. “By degrees it got worse and was particu-
larly bad in cold weather. It was all through me ;
in every part of my system. I’d get up in the
mornings with my fingers swollen and twisted and
stiff. My joints would swell and turn red and
were fearfully tender. I was so stiff I could
hardly move. If I’d got one jot worse I
would have had to throw up my work, that of
trolly driver for T. F. Robertson & Co. I could
hardly put the collars on the horses. Each morn-
ing when I was getting dressed I went through
agony. The children used to lace my boots, for I
simply couldn’t bend. Perhaps for weeks I’d be
free from pain, but then with the least change in
the weather I d.be stricken as if by lightning.
The pain was agonising. I could riot eat, and
every month saw me worse. My wife rubbed me
with liniments, but I got no lasting relief. I felt
as if my fingers were in a vice and being twisted
round and round. At night I’d sit down to my
tea, and just as I was comfortable the pain would
come on. I got little or no rest at night, lying
awake for hours with the pain. I tried all sorts
of ways and methods to cure myself, but I must
say that Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills alone are
responsible for my cure. I started them after
reading Mr. Orchard’s case in the Burra Record.
After the third box I felt that they were doing
me good ; my appetite was better. From that on
the aches and pains got less, and in the end I was
cured. I’ve not had a twinge since, and I shall
always speak well of them. Besides curing my
rheumatism Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills toned me up
in every way.”
It’s important to get the genuine with Dr.
Williams’ name. A shopman once told us that
only “mugs” bought the cheap imitations he
offered. Even the storekeeper doesn’t think
much of the person he can get to take a substitute.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold by chemists and
storekeepers, price 2s. 9d. per box, six boxes
15s. 3d., or they will be sent direct on receipt of
price by the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. of
Australasia Ltd., Sydney.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
The cable announced the other day the
importation of a vast quantity of frozen Chinese
pig into the Cold Coun-
try ; so another nail is
put into the agricultural
Hodge’s coffin, and when
one more Hodge has died
or emigrated, England
will be still a bit more
dependent on the for-
eigner for to-morrow’s
meal. Some day when
the Bull Dog navy has
been badly lamed by the
inventive geniusof a rival
power, and John Bull’s
trade routes are damaged,
all the facts concerning
Freetrade will come to
the surface. But it will
be too late then; for
when the British army
is fighting with its back
to the ancient castle and
very little in its stomach,
7,000,000 people will be
dying in London of starv-
ation. About that time,
no doubt, someone will
arise and yell loudly for
Protection, and anyone who breathes the name of
Cobden will be shot at sight.
The Ma State is in more trouble—some of
the sort of trouble which has made it a reproach
among its “daughters.” At the conference of
Ministers of Agriculture 18 months ago it was
agreed that no State should prohibit the importa-
tion of fruit or vegetables from another State on
account of a disease that was common to both
States; yet the other day Ma’s Minister of Agri-
culture calmly tore up that agreement and pro-
hibited the landing of Tasmanian spuds and
threatened to stop Victorian ones also, on account
of their being allegedly afflicted with Irish blight.
Tasmania has that curse in spots, and Victoria has
it in one locality ; but Ma herself also laments its
occurrence on the Clarence River. Of course,
nobody wants to see the disease spread further
than can be helped, but isn’t a State Insect’s
promise as binding as an ordinary citizen’s?
THE STREET OF THE TOMBS.
AUS : “Glad when I’m out of this! Gives me
the creeps! ”
T.A. : Surely the time has come when
this country should either crawl into the ash
barrel or do something. There arrived in Sydney
the other day one L. H. Drakeford, whose mission
is “ to inquire into the possibilities of Australia
as a market for Chinese steel and iron.” I move
that the State, for a start, request Micko of
Waterloo and his cobber, Jonno of the Rocks, to
cease bombarding Sing Soon with beer bottles
and blue metal, and direct these missiles in the
direction of chose people who are strenuously
assuring us that the idea of this country attempt-
ing to make steel rails is preposterous.
Thus did the Sydney Telegraph give the
show away on Saturday
The State Premiers knew that if the.y could not get
good terms from Mr. Deakin, who would be likely to he
in strong sympathy with them, their chance from the
next Government would be infinitesimal.
In other words, they grabbed the chance of the
present Fluke Ministry being temporarily in
power to close the matter ; and now they have the
impudence to suggest that' this fluked agreement
shdl be embodied in the Constitution “for all
time,” although they admit that from the next
Government (representing the probable opinion
of the people, say, next year) they wouldn’t have
Buckley’s chance of getting the terms now pro-
posed.
“M.A.” on sweated agriculturists,;—
It is now verging on four months since the underpaid
employees at the Hawkesbury State cow-farm (N.S.W.)
sent Minister Perry a petition stating the worst of their
many grievances, and praying him to admit them under
Chairman Addison’saward, given some two months before.
The State’s Hawkesbury cow-men work from 78 to 86
hours weekly, and their pay is from 25 to 60 per cent, less
than Addison granted in his award to the Sydney men
similarly employed. Now they learn that “ the matter
is receiving consideration,” and they are indulging the
hope that another three or four months should see this
** consideration ” well on the way towards a final decision.
They argue that the Wade Government can’t go on
making private employers do things they, as employers,
refuse to do themselves—and that just shows one the
silly things some people will “argue.”
THE INCUBUS.
The S. Australian Labor party intends to
make the extension of the Legislative Council
franchise the battle cry at the next election. The
party wants to win a vote for every man and
woman in the State for both Chambers ; and when
that’s done the next logical step will be to wipe
one of the two Houses out of existence altogether.
Arthur Griffith, M.L.A., has arisen to
propose that every N.S. W. mother should receive
a bonus of £5 towards expenses when baby arrives.
The proposal has a lot to recommend it, provided
there are not too many inquiries about baby’s
father ; it is the mother of the baby whose father
must not be too closely inquired about who, as a
rule, is most in want of £s—or even £l5. In fact,
there are times when the wild prodigality of
£25 would do her no harm. Has Griffith, M.L.A.,
considered this aspect of the case? He can’t pro-
pose to shut out from the State bounty the mother
who needs it most, and he will be clawed all over
by Cats if he proposes to let her in.
When it comes down to the hard bedrock
of actual experience, it turns out that there isn’t
any job in a white man’s country that isn’t a white
man’s job. In Victoria, 30 odd years ago,
some people were quite sure that mining
wasn’t white man’s work; and they
started to introduce Chinamen—and that’s
how the A.M.A. came to be started;
the veteran W. G. Spence is still on hand
in the House of Representatives to tell
the story. Afterwards, sugar-growing
wasn’t white man’s work. It took years
to knock out that fiction ; but it’s dead
now. Then cotton-growing couldn’t pos-
sibly be white man’s work; quite a lot
of sensible southerners were so sure on
this point that they ruled cotton-growing
out of their list of possible Australian in-
dustries. Now, however. Archdeacon
Campbell, the practical scientist who looks
after the soul of Cairns, and between
times tries to fill the empty spaces of the
North with population, reports the results
of his experimental cotton plantation. He
declares that, not only is it a white man’s
job, but, so far as the vast bulk of the
northern land is concerned, cotton is far
better able to pay white man’s wages
than sugar-cane is, and offers far better
working conditions.
In spite of the yarn of the Argos
that there really isn’t any need of a
graduated land-tax to burst up the huge
Western District sheep-walks, because
they are already being rapidly burst up
by their owners, there are only 76,000
acres under crop for wheat or hay in the whole
district this year. The total area under crop in
Victoria is 2,302,300 acres, so the splendidly fer-
tile and well-watered western country accounts
for less than one acre in every 30. And, of
course, it isn’t because the land won’t grow
wheat; in fact, this district has easily the highest
average yield in the State for the scrap that the
big squatter does cultivate. Last year, when the
average for Victoria was down to 6’55 bushels per
acre, the Western District average was 15 05
bushels—ls'os bushels compared with the starva-
tion I’o2 bushel reaped in the Tatcheradivision of
the heart-breaking Mallee, on to which settlers
have lately been pushed.
The Improvement Lease, which seems to
be a sort of Jonah, has landed N.S.W. in more
trouble. According to the Crown Lands Act, a
lessee must get 60 days’ notice before being
thrown off his lease. The Land Board and the
Land Appeal Court, and also the legal advisers of
Wade—mostly himself—decided that this two
months’ notice need not be given in resuming an
improvement lease, wherefore numerous holders
were summarily ejected. But first the Full Court
and now the High Court have gone against the
Crown, which has consequently to pay a stack of
Costs for the information. The Government, in
addition, will have to re-invest the leases in the
lessees, and begin again with 60 days’ notice, and
pay large sums to recompense the cockies to
whom it granted the lands. Or it will have to
bring down a hurried Act to validate its error,
and then hand over much cash as compensation to
the improvement lessees.
This is how the S. M. Herald seeks
(21/8/’O9) to excuse its frenzied opposition during
the past four months to the Fisher Government’s
sea-defence proposals, which have now been
adopted holus-bolus by the representative of the
Fused Government in London
Had Mr. Fisher, when he unfolded his defence policy,
felt himself at liberty to tell us that he was taking a
course which was generally approved, if not actually
prompted, by the Admiralty, it is quite certain that
those proposals would have had a kinder reception.
It is typical. The Herald wasn’t prepared to
consider the Fisher scheme (so long as there was a
suspicion that the same was of local extraction)
on its merits or in any other respect. But if some
one had only made it plain that the dashed thing
came from London, then the crawlsome old im-
porting sheet would have rushed forward and
cheered it like mad.
By the Old Soldier :
“ Alexem’s ” remarks (B. 19/8/’O9) about the unpopu-
larity of Spain’s little war in Morocco don’t tell quite all
the trouble. The Spanish army is even more unpopular
than the war. It is one of those useless, sham-
aristocratic encumbrances which irresponsible govern-
ments are accustomed to inflict on the people. The
Spanish army has never, since Roeroi, been worth its salt.
It only made the flimsiest pretence of opposing the
Yankees in Cuba and the Philippines, and it has gone on
in Morocco as if it wanted to be beaten. The Spanish
army of the last two centuries has scarcely ever shown
itself dangerous to the enemies of its country, but has
been very dangerous indeed to the people of Spain. Its
principal use has long been to make ” pronuncia-
mentos,” and for many years it also served to furnish
lovers for Queen Isabella and her mother, men
like Narvaez, Prim and Serrano. Now' that Spain pretends
to have a constitutional monarchy, the generals no longer
“ pronounce,” because their pow'er is too well understood
to make it necessary. In 1905 the Cortes passed a law
which made anyone accused of “insuking the army”
liable to be tried by court-martial. Members were plainly
told that if they did not pass it they would be turned
into the streets of Madrid. During the last session the
Catalan deputies, feeling the measure was directed
against their province, demanded the repeal of the law ;
but Maura, the Premier, refused, though he said he w'as
not coerced by the army. The war in Morocco is only
one, and one of the smallest, of Spanish grievances. The
army itself is a much greater grievance.
Coroner Cole, of Melbourne, recently
remarked that the prevalence of infanticide in the
Yic. capital reminded him of “ the worst days of
the Roman Empire.” And the big estates of the
Western District also suggest the worst days of
the Roman Empire. Perhaps the two evils go
together.
“ LO, THE WISE INDIAN!”
A Hindoo, in a land ballot on the Upper Tweed River
(N.S.W.), secured the pick of 13 blocks against 180 white
men who were applicants. This occurrence has created a
great deal of ill-feeling in the district, and at a public
meeting at Tyalgum the state of the land laws which
allows of such a position was vigorously denounced.—

My Dear Arini.—

are winning tame hearts or shooting wild things in
the northern capital. A daughter of Dr. Mildred
Creed is instructing the demoiselles Honor and
Morvyth in the art and craft of stencilling, and they
nave already done some curtains for use in one of
the battlemented structures belonging to Peer
Dudley. Battlements and a ghost and ad vowsons
seem necessary evils to the lot of a lord (unless
he is Irish—then he has a bog and a writ and a
banshee). I have only just found out the mean-

banging on to the property recently bought by
Baronet Lucas-Tooth from one of England’s old
nobility. That is to say, the translated brewer

Observing the clouds of unexpected people who
own motor-cars, the thought occurs : Can they all
afford the juggernauts? A decade ago a
carnage and pair were a sort of hall-mark
ot wealth. Hardly anyone sported such an
eonon whose «K»me was less than (say)
£dUOO per annum. To-day many a thousand-
a-year citizen runs his high-power petrol convey-
ance, and runs it pretty constantly too. Now a
carnage and pair may be sustained with ease at a
cost of £250 per annum. The carriage, once
bought, lasts for years, and if it is of an
attractive design in the first instance, will
rail to pieces before it takes on an out-
ot-date appearance. The indigenous carriage
steed wears well. I know a family which has
been sitting behind the same pair of equities for
e past seven years, and to mv unhorsey eye
the animals still look as good as new. How dif-
terent is the case of the motor! Its original
cost is dreadful. There are numbers of
them careering about the city as 1 write
which cost up to £l5OO landed here. Tyres are a
big item. A “ blow-out ” means, I am given to
understand, an expenditure of not less than £ll.
Un a recent trip to the Kurrajong my host
experienced four of these expensive misfortunes.
Ihe petrol-bill is a consideration. A chauffeur is a
considerably more costly menial than a coachman,
there are entertainment expenses in connection
with motor-owning that were never entered on any
carriage-keeping balance-sheet. And finally, a
demon of unrest and dissatisfaction appears to pos-
sess the car-possessor, so that he is never quite satis-
hed with the vehicle he has got. but always longs
to call his own the last brand of dog-crusher which
whirled past him a cloud of dust. There seems to
be a concensus of opinion among frank and un-
biassed experts that a really good motor is liable
one way and another, to run its proprietor into the
dis hii sement of about £6OO a year or more. No •
for the life of me I can’t grasp how the average
motor-enthusiast manages.
What a negligible section of our gilded youth
goes in, publicly, for chorus-damsel entertaining
nowadays ! Are the stage maidens going off in the
matter of looks and allurement ? Or are the
young men with ready cash to liquidate growing
old and parsimonious before their time? Who
shall say? The fact remains that in the resorts
where one has a right to look for the idle and im-
mature male, adoring at the directoire gown and
garish hat of her who sings and dances for a
living, there is little or nothing doin tr . I
can number on the fingers of one "hand

of an afternoon And even this little band of
stalwarts has taken to doing its dash in a diffident
almost ashamed fashion. The type that remains
constant at the shrine of the footlights lady—so
constant, that is to say, as to worship there in
public—seems to be getting as infrequent and as
out of date as the stage-door habitue. And the
stage-door haunter, so I am credibly informed
has not existed among the ranks of really modish
males since the death of the late Queen Victoria.

Matters has tried her “selections for recitation”
in several of the capitals of the Commonwealth
® h s, wa f Sydney before the Commonwealth
eventuated. But of late years we have heard of
her as a suffragette militant. It was she who
chained herself to the grille in the House of Com-
mons and demanded “ votes for women ” in her
best elocutionary form. Whether the minions of
the Housepf C. found the key of the padlock or
whether they had to get a cold chisel before they
could take the downtrodden female into l
dungeon, is a forgotten point. Anyhow, the lady
was lucky. A thoroughly-callous House would

Miss _Ruby Adams, that voung-novelist’s-
dream-of-a-heroine girl known to Sydneysiders

order)! They must have found her guilty of

turn the gallant Frenchmen dizzy, and drive them

Whilst rambling about songsters, Fanny Bauer
who was known here as the North Shore soprano’
brings her big, fair German-looking presence and
lovely voice back under engagement to J.C.W.
She has mown many of her laurels in critical
Gallic and Ausoman centres, and Sydney is glad
that she is returning before they are on the
w!rt ei T d f S e ;- nr ISS Bauer went hence to study
with a fanatically musical group—Miss Moss'
late T Sldne y of that name; Miss
X-°* et -». Ba lmam, Laurence G. Smith and little
Miss Myrtle Meggy. Like herself, they were
students all, with the exception of Miss Moss.
Still harping on warblers like Hamlet on Polo-
nius daughter: Last week I was bushed on the
piano-floor at Pa mg s when Melba’s pilot-fish,
I. IS. Southwell, swam up and intercepted
the long perspective of polished rosewood
and ebony instruments. Waving his right fin with
considerable aplomb, he mentioned that a
nn° S qw? roml f lng ]f sso y° un gster had alighted
on Sjdney from Queensland, and was going to
have his fine natural roar put into training. The
basso was present—adatk, curly, rather fat youth,
but good-looking Withal. ‘ * Southie ” disappeared
to catch an accompanist. In about 70 seconds he
rushed back, driving before him a breathless girl
Wearing brown velvet and the tiniest of hands
‘‘Miss Cane will play,” quoth S. A song with a
ferocious accompaniment was set up, the girl sat
down, and the man from Mackay made an unpro-
fessional debut, quite justifying his introducer’s
opinion. Mackay, upon inquiry at a map, I
find to be a place north of .Rockhampton. The
information that Melba was married at Mackay
was proffered me. I forgot to say that the basso’s
name is Percy Graham.
Was it by chance that our friend Hazon and his
son Mario met J.C.W. at Genoa? The Hazons
abide at Milan, and Milan isn’t just round the
corner from Genoa, you know. We hear rumors
of J.C.W. flocking with these or other artists,
and, “in the gross and scope of my opinion, this
bodes some strange irruption to our State.”
Twelve hundred beautiful pounds sterling is
said to be the sum sacrificed by Melba through the
abandonment of her tour through the North-
western towns. The money is in a bank, and will
be returned to the subscribers. Mention of the
IS or’-west recalls that one of the Melbian staff told
me that Moree was a wonderful place for making
at the top of one’s physical condition.
When you meet anyone with rheumatism,”
quote the speaker, “tell him to go to Moree.”
Most of my friends have rheumatism, but if I
started to advise Moree as the all-round cure, I
would be suspected of being a property-owner
Amongst this season’s flock of fledgling violinists
are a girl and a boy, Allie Dearn and Lionel
Lawson, who are said to promise well for their
future progress along the track trodden by Paga-
Ysaye, Cyril Monk, Mrs. Bessie Doyle
U Moore, et al. The youngsters play next Tuesday
at an invitation recital at the Y.M.C.A.
Mrs. O’Moore, who returned to Sydney some
two years ago and has been working on pupil
material, quits us presently to take a violin pro-
fessorship at the Leland Stanford University in
California. About the handsomest of all the
ri n . lusl(i *ansis this departer. She is rather
like Maxine Llliot, which is really a kind thin<> r to
say of Maxine. °
Ada Crossley, so correspondents are telling
was only back in London at her St. John’s Wood
lair long enough to unpack her frocks and ton of
curios and travel-trophies before toil swallowed
her up again. A provincial tour, oratorio fes-
tivals, nine ballad concerts and a recital in Lon-
don were all she had on hand when I last heard of
her. Successful singers—singers who really Get
1 here—are amazingly strong. All the same, it
was very cute of the Crossley to marry a doctor.
Those two captains of industry, Mrs. McCormack
and Miss Eadith Walker, have organised the
matinee that will crowd the stage of Her Majesty’s
cm Saturday next with well-known people in
tableaux from well-known pieces of stage-craft.
Manager Ramaciotti calls it a revue of comic
operas and plays, and adds that it is a sort of thing
that has never been done here before. So for
anything new under the sun let us be truly thank-
ful, and buy a seat for the performance. Amongst
the favorites to be pictured are “The Belle of
New York ‘ San Toy,” “ The Duchess of Dant-
J-he Ring of Cadonia,” “The Merry
Wjdow, Three Little Maids,” “ Havana,” and
When We Were Twenty-One,” in which last
the Sydney Comedy Club will disport itself. The
Civil Ambulance Brigade will profit by the dis-
play.
An Australian girl now on her way back from
rambling m English and foreign capitals, fluffs
about a few chorus girls: “That ox eye daisy
amongst show-girls, Ida Barnard, has a good
show-myself part in “Our Miss Gibbs” at
the Gaiety. Miss Beetham, who used to be a
pretty and popular unit of J.C.W.’s chorus, and
who, two years ago married a man of supposed
great wealth, is back in the chorus ranks. Report
says their wealth has bolted, and that the husband
t fast enough to overtake it. I saw Alice
Hollander singing at the London Pavilion music
hall, one is married awfully well, and hubby does
not at all approve of her return to the footlights
and p-audits. Her voice is good, but the way in

A romantic theory was that of Mr. Law Har-
greaves regarding the ring bolts and carvings at
WooHahra Point—namely that they were the
work of Spanish grandees, cArca 1650. But now
the Historical Society, which has no soul for
romance, comes forward with what seems a more
hkely though less thrilling explanation. Wool-
ahra Point, which is a part of Point Piper, was
once owned by Captain Piper. He was a great
entertainer. A big garden party was given by
him in 1817, and (according to the Historical
Society) the ring bolts were fixed to hold the
vessels while the guests disembarked, Point Piper

Mr. Robert Prendergast died in Melbourne last
week. He was a son of the handsome and affluent
widow Prendergast, who wedded a member of the
big Anglo-Romish Vaughan family last year.

Jrrendergast was only 28 years of age.

matter with also telling them of the decree nisi,
which is so often a notification, not only of the
death of one marriage, but of the birth
of a couple more. And if the pronounce-
ment of the decree nisi is to be thus
placarded, it is only logical that the service
of the divorce papers should be also notified. The

YESTERDAY A POOL WAS I.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
VICTORIA.
Yesterday a fool was I,
Saw a pretty face,
Saw a flash of ankle,
Fluttering of lace.
Saw a glance which seemed to say
“ Follow, follow me.
Follow, follow Corj'don,
On to Arcady.”
Yesterday I looked in eyes
Grey, or blue, or green ;
Changing as the sunset
In a opal sheen.
Siren eyes that ravished
All the soul of ine.
“Whither, whither Corydon?”
“ Off to Arcady.”
Yesterday I gazed on lips
Smiling up at me ;
Tan talising—pouting
Most bewitehingly.
Lips that whispered, pleading,
“Follow, follow me.”
Phyllis fled : I followed on—
On for Arcady.
Yesterday all fooled was I
By a pretty face ;
By a flirt of ankle,
Fluttering of lace.
By a glance which seemed to say
“ Follow, follow me.
Follow, follow Corydon,
On to Arcady.”
Yesterday I oft will rue.
Phyllis knew a thing or two.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 23, 1909.
My Dear Yarrik,—
The non-race-going residents of Caulfield, also'
those who do go to the races but would like the
local racecourse enclosure to be something of a
recreation ground on the 350 days of the year
when no charge is made for admission, have suc-
ceeded in getting the Minister of Lands to make
a “proposal.” The proposal is that the V. A.T.C.
shall disgorge a trifle of its profits to the Govern-
ment trustees of the reserve, “to be expended in
such a way as to provide special improvements
and accommodation for the benefit of the public”—
on non-racing days. The Caulfield racecourse
reserve has been sinfully diverted from the pur-
pose for which it was intended. It was dedicated
to the use of the public as a park ground for re-
creation and racing, but the trustees have practi-
cally allowed the racing club to take full control
of it. this is the way things generally happen
when a club is very energetic and some trustees
are very tired. Personally I feel that I want to
boil a billy and hold high picnic on Caulfield on
some summer holiday— not that I ever do these
things; but I want to do them when I find I can’t
do them.
The papers are making a great fuss over quite
minor flood affairs—about the small cocky who has
lost his cow or seen his fences swept hilariously
down stream, or his pet chimney sitting down
hard and suddenly in someone else’s grass pad-
dock. . These are all so trivial. The really
pathetic spectacle of the floods and disaster —the
harrowing, heart-rendingscene—isthatofSquatter-
dom sitting on its soppy billiard table trying to keep
its feet dry. Flooded out in every part, no
snootin’ don’t you know, can’t get to the city
because the railway is a ruin, no telephones to
wire agonised Fat troubles over, no papers, no
letters, and nothing to talk of but the weather
and there are too many cusses in that. So Squat-
tocracy has to be content with social evenings at
home. The sheep community is suffering from
brain fag, and even bridge loses its fascination,
ialk about the cookies and their spoiled few
acres ! Lord, what do they know of misery
in a flood ?
Victoria s only baronet was duly released from
the matrimonial yoke last week on the petition of
Amy Mary Clarke, wife of the above. There was
nothing for the lady and her lawyers to do but to
produce evidenceof theotherlady (or “person”) to
the satisfaction qf the Court. Possibly, the Court
had been unofficially aware of the person for some
years past, but it listened to the evidence with an
air of pained surprise, and granted Amy Mary
Clarice aforesaid a decree nisi, with Costs against
the absentee. In a sporting way of speaking “it
was no race. Ihe wife had a walk-over, to the
grief of many good matrons, who would have
give.n their latest Paris hats to see Connie Waugh
in the witness box. The fair one, though missing
in the flesh, was represented in the spirit by two
letters which had drifted into the possession of the
petitioner’s solicitors, and these were the only rays
'm suns h* ne that gladdened the dull proceedings.
.., letters brief and to the point—sounded so
like the writer that an identification of her signa-
ture seemed unnecessary. The first one (dated
March, 1J06) said : ‘ Lear Rupert—Lo not forget
that we dine at the Savov to-morrow nio'ht
7 o clock—Yours, Connie. RS.— Do not go to the
old theatre afterwards.” The second billet doux
told its own story of confiding love: “Dear
think I will go to Sydney for a few days.
Will leave next mail boat. Be at your rooms 4.30
'nu^° rrow ‘ 11 seme money — Yours, Connie.”
I his was dated 2£ years later than the other It
takes time for even a baronet to attain that posi-
tion in a Connie’s regard, where she addresses him
as Dear Heart,” and commands him to meet
her at his office with his cheque-book in his
pocket.
The Morel 1 Kelly and her languid Willy-bov
are flattmg at Melbourne’s Mansions of the Blest
m Collins-street. The beautiful Raleighs are also
moving the mangle and the turn-up bed and the
kerosene tin with the coal in it to a section of that
rashionable abode. Are things looking up or
down? The Peter Mitchells, who are rich like
Hoggenheimer, preen their wings at the Grand,
T7-TT r filter to the metropolis of
. c - ' / tl. Mrs. Mitchell wears the newest thing
in furs, which is muff—muff profundus. She
wears other things, but they are almost unneces-
sary behind the vast screen of rabbit-oh.
Two more rubber necks are back in Melbourne—
Colonel dohnstone and languid youth Goodall
of the Frank Madden throng. They have been
playing about where the rubber grows in Papua
and converse of lordly thousands that only want
nursing to shoot into millions. Rubber was
always a stretchable point.
A scornful man-who, evidently, would object
to being called a ‘ gay dog ” —makes rude remarks
upon the I estival of St. Bow-Wow at the Exhi-
bition Building :
It might be remarked, as a preface to a chat on a dog
to the h p ; e* Predilection for animals dates back
to the lirst Accident. For it was Eve’s craze for
anacondas that drove Adam to go on the land. And it is
noticeable that Eve’s fad for domestic pets is still heartv
enough to puzzle the psychologists. One mav stroil
hpho'm u th ,t Sh °n at Melbourne Exhibition, and still
behold her descendants clutching various assortments of
nHin a " d nol , S , e ' • T ?, me > a dog has always been purely
utilitarian He is either a ratter or a target for boots y
I never could see anything sentimental about him, except
h.s tail; nor anything adorable except his distance
But to women especially those of uncertain youth-he
is a piece of poetry, a face rest, and a butt for all the
delicious argot of the nursery. You will see elderly
spinsters, who would be severe and didactic on any sub-
ject from aviation to strawberry culture, change to the
burbling fanaticism of a young mother when a do-- is
mentioned. They bend over their exhibits in the show
f .f, as the - v stroke their dinky darlings—the doggies
without parts and magnitude, such as tov and Yorkshire
terriers—they will become eloquent on Towser’s historv
and dietary eccentricities. Most of these ladies are iri-
and eS tw ln - an f° dd Wa b' °' le or two ma - v wear pince-nez
and that air of rugged masculinity that develops when
the last hope has taken himself and his serious inten-
tions over the curve of the horizon. But in all their eves
is the glare of the propagandist or the Chapzander zeaiot
I saw a row of them, strange and reverent, before a col-
lection of those pure white, woolly bow-w'ows that are
generally used as sofa ornaments or boudoir requisites
These dogs, like the shivering diminutive toy-terriers do
not excite quite the contempt which attached to a Greek
emperor, but they are treated with a care and attention
that would never be extended to a hungry tramp Thev
repose on cushions in the bebe tints of pink, or butter-
cup, or the sweetest blue. They have their mistresses to
comfort arid succor them when they are abungered or
athirst. Their kennels are canine palaces in polished
wood, and they are called such names as “Pinkie” and
“ Bowy.” And thepoodles-the King Charles and Japan-
ese spaniels ; and all the dogs that are not dogs but
toilet articles are treated with similar consideration
Women do not appear to prefer the big dogs—the borzois'
tne great Danes, the bull and Irish terriers—and I never
saw one cuddling one of those serial animals that
nr*' summer dogs, because in winter their protracted
entrance keeps the door open too long, although their
Bologna-sausage shape is most suitable for a squeeze.
. o , women of the matured, maidenly variety prefer the
tiny animals ; and when I think what a solace a mena-
gerie must he to them in their declining years, I am
deeply grateful for the menagerie’s creation.
The masked ball of the Artists is to occur
earlier than the first fixed date —in the last lap of
August instead of during one of the early sprints
of September. The glories of it are spoken with
mysterious fervor. Processions and sets of
artistic flavor are being cemented together
with much rehearsal and agonised imagination.
Policemen and fairies and such common or garden
folk are to be strictly taboo. Unless one’s
costoowi (to quote Mrs. Wiggs) reaches such a
point of excitement that the Gippsland tiger is a
mere peaceful saucer of milk by comparison, the
would-be reveller will be shot into outer darkness.
Fantastic and wild or transcendently beautiful
one must be in toggery, for the V. A.S. intends to
knock things. As a discount to the boh-est bohemi-
anism of the revel, tickets this time are declared
available only when accompanied by the endorse-
ment of an invitation. You are invited, but you
pay; and even if you rush in and pay. it doesn’t
follow that you will be invited. So there you
are. All this excitement is to transpire on Satur-
day the 28th—two days after this issue pushes its
red nose into the world.
W. G. Baumann, of Baumann’s Cafe, Sydney,
died a few days back. Father and son, the
Baumanns have been in the Australian catering
trade for something like 40 years. Thirty years
ago the father, who is still alive, had a cafe in
Swanston-street, Melbourne; but he moved on
to Sydney shortly afterwards.
William Webb, the Bendigo flour miller, who
died recently worth a shade over £28,000, left a
couple, of curious legacies. To the widow and
children of John Flanagan, an old servant. £lOO
is to be paid for their kindness to his sick dog
Fido, and a similar amount goes to Samuel Trea-
grove for his care of a second dog. Webb was a
busy man who couldn’t spare time to think up
new names for dogs ; so the second animal’s name
had to be Fido, too. The owner was too busy
even to call him Rover.
An Australian girl writes from London :
Mrs. Norman Bayles is dashing round somewhat con-
siderable in the Fog City. She is generally perched up
on the car beside her husband, who handles the wheel like
an expert, and preserves his cornflower buttonhole pure
and unspotted through it all. He runs over no dogs, nor
does he drag the mangled lamp-post behind him in his
wild career.
Among the Australians who are brandishing a bold
cleek on the links about London are our old friends the
Hartley Williamses. The Victorian ex-Judge is still a pink
and silver exquisite, and his dame’s figure remains the
wonder of her chums.
Another keen Australian golfer is Frank Dutton, the
evergreen. After 20 years in John Bull’s country—the
old Adelaide bachelor knows how to get the best out of
life and the most for his bawbees. He belongs to half a
dozen swell clubs, and to all the swagger associations
for the promotion of sport and pleasure. Also, as a
cavalier of dames, he maintains his form, as the sports
say.
The English women have started to sport flowers—
fresh or artificial—with their outdoor garb. Malmaison
roses and violets are the most popular blooms thus flour-
ished. Some women even carry a posy or one large single
bloom in the hand. The idea is of French origin, but no
one eversees the female relatives of John Bull carry or
wear a flower like one to the manner born as does the
Parisienne. Another new French idea exploited just now
is the giant brolly, ala Directoire. This implement, in
addition to the long-stick lorgnette, makes the ordinary
duchess more formidable than graceful. It is only an
actress who can employ the Directoire gamp with any
effect, and then it is purely stage effect.
Melba is to spend the coming week with us
indulging in a sociable loaf. Three concerts
happen at so much of Ballarat as hasn’t been
washed away, and later at as much of Geelong as
has managed to keep dry. Melba’s coming might
cause the rains to cease and the floods to subside.
In all her Australian trip—from March to August
and from to Toowoomba, also from
Cairns to Thargomindah—the lady only snared
two rainy nights for her warbling. Drought fol-
lowed her footsteps, and unless things alter it
will be possible next summer to identify her track
by the bones of famished cattle on each side of the
way.
Hugh Ward changed his matinee day last week,
and invited all the artists from the other theatres
to come and see him act. It was a cute idea.
Every actor and actress turned up. It was an in-
teresting house to outsiders—mummers on the
stage and mummers all round. A most sym-
pathetic audience. Suppose the fellow feeling
made them respond to every minute point.
Rose Musgrove was not playing. She stayed
in bed nursing a whitlow on her finger-
poor dear. The Braytons brightened one box.
Lily was togged in her favorite old rose color and
a huge hat. Titheradge and Kingston, opposite,
challenged that picture with their Dorothy Grim-
ston, a most artistic frocker, all in black, furs and
all, with half an acre of violets to show up the
effect of her brown eyes. Everybody indulged in
mutual admiration in the Winter Garden at tea
time, and it was quite a successful party.
Mrs. George Langridge—one of the earliest of
Amy Castles’ admirers—gave a big crush to
welcome the little lady home. It was at the
Salon, with a musical programme dashed in. Most
of the guests got into the room—but just got there,
they spent the rest of the time holding their own
few inches of space. A fraction of the room
below the stage was cleared for Miss Castles—
just one scrap of high land in the flood of clothes
and flesh. She has most beauteous frocks, that
£ II- b The reception gown was a dilution of
amethysts and sapphires, well mixed and poured
evenly over her snug little body. Topping this
were ermine furs and a most amazing hat—black
and large and velvet, with a great white feather
like the one Gilbert, King of Cadonia, clips with
bis garden shears. Mrs. Auctioneer Langridge,
who held the guest up for inspection, was tailor-
made and smart in violet. Mrs. J. C. Williamson
held her own with an ermine jacket. How do you
expect “Johanna” to writein cold black ink about
a whole jacket of ermine—the adorable sort
of thing that snuggles on to one with its
clinging satin lining and its enchanting ivory
whiteness? That and a muff too. A sheath of
white cloth skirt was all that appeared below this
voluptuousness. Lily Brayton looked like a copy
of a Titian-haired lady much in evidence in the
last important divorce case. A satin substitute
for a frock clung about her, and a transparent lace
coat hugged that. There were sables somewhere
in the middle distance in an escort’s arm,
and the lady looked out of a cart-wheel
hat. Miss Grace Palotta looked Frenchily
smart. You can t beat black in a crowd.
Her black was the blackest, and a cunning little
hat of black had a dull gold twist to its anatomy.
She came with Mrs. Clapp—a dear old lady
mother of the dressmaker Clapps. The Pinschofs
were in force. Mrs. Beatrice-Daniels-Roberts
that charming lady with the much painted
(portrait-painted) hair, wore black to the
glory of her crown. Mrs. Hogan had a
beaming smile and furs. A few men strayed in.
The Maclnerney lawyer-doctor was there, and
his big Major brother, and Dr. Felix Meyer with
his Saxon-fair wife. The new Russian Consul
(when are we going to stop getting new ones?)
looked sad and weary—mebbe because he was
getting squashed in a far corner. Another man
was the Castles tenor, Nicol Anderson, who
came along with the Tait Brethren. I think Amy
Castles felt that she was welcomed home.
A report blows around that Australia may soon
lose its beloved Bland Holt and the cheery, happy
Mrs. Bland. They are said to have ideas of going
to England, where the lady has golden relatives.
These relatives are not merely gilded, but 18-carat.
Mrs. Bland is a spoiled child of fortune— barring
the fact that she isn’t spoiled—and Bland’s habit
of lavishing gifts upon her has grown into a fix-
ture. Among other results of this habit, she has
one of the finest collection of turquoises on which
a burglar ever gazed at 2 a.m.
“Derby day was a beast of a day”—so a girl
writes me from London. “The rain drizzled all
the time. (It often drizzles in Londoh, bhfc
seldom does a good downpour, so the city makes
a little rain go a lohg Way.) I hied me ttt
Epsom in a covered motor. It Was burtons
to hear the tipsters at Epsom— we don’t
allow them to rage so conspicuously ih Australia;
Epsom is a most Uncomfortable place to go to.
One wretched stahd, reserved for the upper
storeys of the peerage, consists of pigepn-holed
boxes, from which the dukes Watch the race;
There are no nice laWns as at Flemington. To be
sure, there are enclosures where you pay £l to go
in and stand—noshelterand hoseats. Thereisalso
an enclosure where you can get two square inches of
seat in the rain at £5 a time. I suppose the duke
pays £lOO for his pigeon-hole. It’s worth while
battling round to see the side shows—the Aunt
Sallies and the costers in their donkey carts with
their ’Arriets, only ’Arriet, this time, Was rather
spoiled by the rain, Still £1 to stand and £5 to
sit down in the rain ! ! ! ”
Scraps of news drift through regarding Miss
Ereda Sternberg—a young scientist who was right-
hand woman to dead Dr. Maclnerney and a help
to young medico Nelly in excursions among those
atoms that look like nightmares under a micro-
scope. She has been chasing banshees in Ireland
for recreation, and is now in London inspecting
the local germ at the new bacteriological school.
She intends to pick up a few extra handfuls of
knowledge in Paris and other scientific cities
before returning.
From “Rosna,”of Adelaide :
The vice-regals went forth and made Renniark happy
last week ; and the whole irrigation township had its
curled and wore a cauliflower in its buttonhole. There
was a Masonic ball, whereat the Exes, danced with the
local Lord High Orange-growers ; there was a show to
open, a luncheon to dispatch, and a drive round the
settlement. Then having collected a few addresses, the
party steamed back down the Muddy—that is to say, the
Murray.
Bryceson Trehearne’s young Repertory Theatre has had
another bout of literary plays—two nights of them—in
the North Hall at the Conservatonum. The audience
was too big for the building, and quite half of it had to
be persuaded to go home. By 7.30 every available square
inch of hall was occupied. By 8 o’clock the crowds had
filled up every aisle, completely obliterating the view of
the moderately early birds who had c .ught the back
seats. It took considerable rhetoric to prove to them
that the performance could not begin until they ceased
to obstruct the view. Two of Yeats’ plays were given—
the tragedy “ Deirdre,” and the charming little legendary
play, “Kathleen ni Houlihan Synge’s brilliant Irish
picture, “The Shadow of the Glen”; Oscar Wilde’s
“ Florentine Tragedy ” ; “Pericles and Aspasia,” a Greek
satire by Courtney ; and “ Winter Dawn,” a clever tragic
little sketch by Gibbon. For the last named, young Carlien
Jiirs had composed some tuneful accompanying wails to be
used by a string quartette. The incidental music for
“ Deirdre,” comprising prelude, songs and such, written by
Mr. Treharne himself, were a special feature of the show.
For an amateur business, the interpretation was remark-
ably good throughout. The audiences contained most of
the University bigwigs, and, among others too numerous
to mention, Miss Catherine Helen Spence, S. Australia’s
foremost literary woman, carrying her 84 years as though
they were but 20.
Mr. Carlyle Smythe is over in the Slowly Village. He
came a week before his Foster-Fraser lion, just to give u's
a friendly warning to get our best intellects and manners
tidied up and ready, so that the great writer can include
them all in his next book, “Australia at Shirk.” The
much-travelled has taken the Theatre Royal, so that
F.F. may have a fitting place wherein to lecture us
severely.
The golfers have been pursuing a tournament at the
watery waste where the Seaton links ought to be. It is
great ftfn swimming from one tee to another, and using
your opponent for a lifebuoy, and, besides, it’s good for
the complexion. The competitors for the championship
didn’t invite Pluvius down for the final, however, and
their last efforts were achieved under heavenly weather
circumstances. A long trail of spring-frocked persons
trudged doggedly after the would-be champions, and
were afterwards whistled up for tea and buns at the
club-house. The viceroy, a golfer himself, took a
daughter down, while the lady of the house and the
sist.er-twin were saying kind things to orphans elsewhere.
The Carrington-street Orphan Home has had its 49th
birthday, and has moved out to its new quarters at
Mitcham by way of celebration. Mrs. Farr, the founder
of the Home, was likewise celebrating a birthday, but
almost forgot it in her care for the orphans—after 50
years. And yet they say our sex is fickle. Her Ex. first
opened the new Home, and then led the procession to the
lawn, where there were tidies and pincushions to sell to
the rattled visitor.
The same afternoon St. Peter’s College sports packed
the pretty school oval with afrocky bevy of fond mammas
and sisters and cousins and aunts. A young army of
coming Rhodes’ scholars leapt over the earth, and were
duly rewarded with valuable articles they didn’t want.
The Way dame handed them the same, after which tea
and Bedlam were let loose together in the big schoolroom.
Peter Dawson was kidnapped from the Otway by his
adoring family, and concealed for three whole days and a
bit in his native village. His proud ex-preceptor (C. J.
Stevens) and the Choral Society, wherein he sang as a
boy, welcomed him the first night, with Josiah Symon to
disburse the necessary epigrams. He has come back a
thinner, but not an older, Peter, and what he has lost in
flesh he has put on in voice—a joyous and unspoiled
boyish star, who devotes remarkably little conversation
to the subject of Mr. Peter Dawson.
Jessie Redpath, one of our young singer maidens, died
last week, after only a few days’ illness. She was a
daughter of the manager of the Lobethal Woollen Mills,
where we make our good Australian tweeds. Her mother
bad died only five weeks before, and her flatted was already
on his way from London to marry her. A year or so ago
the damsel took her voice to Europe to get it polished ;
but the illness of her mother called her back home.
Yours affectionately,
J OHANNA.
Melbourne people were reminded that old
Time is still a flier when they read last week that
Arthur Snowden had been entertained in a Sun-
day-school room because he was 80 years old.
Snowden used to be a mayor as well as a lawyer
hence the handle to his name, and it doesn’t seem
so long ago since he wasn’t more than 60. Ahy-
way, it is satisfactory to know that he still goes
on Sunday to the church* and is deferred tb by the
brethren as an “ exemplary parishioner.” Thete
are many sorts of exemplary persons—opeh-
handed, close-fisted, genial, jokeless, and Other-
wise—and Snowden is a shining: example of One
of the many sorts.


A WOMAN’S FACE.
THE STORY IT TELLS.
Did it ever occur to you that every woman’s face is a book
of revelations? If she has been negligent or dilatory, her com-
plexion will be defective, her skin unpleasing. But if her com-
plexion is perfect, her skin radiant and clear, you have revela-
tion that she is one of the wise women who know.
Miss Marie Dainton, whose likeness is presented on this
page, enjoys a popularity of which she may be justly proud.
Her extraordinary versatility, her vivacious acting-—her vivid
power of impersonation, her finely trained voice, places her in
the highest altitude of musical stars in England. Whether as
the magnet which draws the Smart Set to the Palace or Pavilion,
or as the prima donna in light opera, Miss Dainton holds her
own in the heart of the British public. Her “ Peggy Macree,”
at Wyndham’s Theatre, is not soon to be forgottem”
Miss Dainton has a dazzling complexion. Read the letter
here produced, and you must conclude that she is one of the
wise women who KNOW.
Now the care of the complexion is, in nine cases out of
ten, a question of Skin Pood only. But when you come to
think of Skin hoods, think also, please, how little you
really know about Skin Foods or the needs
and requirements of the complexion. No
amount of carefulness or discrimination
will be of any use to you if you do not
know. How, then, will you learn, for the
pitfalls are many ? If you lack experience
of your own, learn by that of others.
For weeks past I have been publish-
ing reproductions of autograph letters
from the most noted and prominent
women of the English, American, and
Australian stage, until they have reached
the volume of a mighty chorus of unstinted
praise for the Yalaze toilet preparations
introduced by me.
And, remember, when you read this,
that testimony so overwhelming must
serve as a more than sufficient guide to
the average woman who wishes to be
certain that she is right in her selection
of what is essential to scientific and com-
petent care of the complexion.

Yalaze is not a cosmetic or make-up, but a nourisher,
stimulant, and replenisher of the skin, and that in it is found a
specific, the finest, safest, most efficacious ever produced by
scientific men and means.
I make this sweeping claim for Yalaze because I know that
it produces a smooth, soft, clean, flawless skin ; keeps it freckle
free, tan-free. And the use of this preparation to obtain the
greatest possible benefits does not make a greater demand on
your time than two or three minutes a day. A fortnight to a
month’s use will produce results that will work the most agree-
able surprises that anyone has ever experienced in the care of
the complexion. The price of Yalaze is 3s. 6d. and 6s. 6d a
jar. NO YEN A POUDRE, a “fat” powder for dry and
normal skins. This powder is the only preparation of its kind
which is a skin food as well—2s. and 3s. YALAZE
POWDER, for greasy skins, is supplied at the same price.
NOVENA CERATE is a most effective and natural skin
cleanser. Continued use of Novena Cerate in the nursery
will ensure perfect skin health during childhood—2s. and
3s. 6d. a jar. VALAZE COMPLEXION SOAP, made
of rare herbs and almonds, wholesome, economical, lasts for
several months, 2s. a cake. Dr. Lykuski’s Valaze Black-
head and Open Pore Cure banishes every trace of these
disfigurements, and is an unfailing specialty for
coarse and greasy skins. It closes unduly open
pores, and refines the skin texture, 2s. 10d., posted.
Valaze Lip Lustre, for dull, blanched lips. Biting
and wetting will not displace the coloring it im-
parts, 2s. and 3s.
I am still forwarding free to anyone who
will write to me for it, my book, “ Beauty
in the Making.”
All Chemists stock Yalaze. Orders,
applications for appointments, or my Book,
should be addressed to Mile. Rubinstein,
Dept. 20, Yalaze Institute, 158 Pitt Street,
Sydney; 274 Collins Street, Melbourne; and at
Wellington and London.

A NEW INVENTION THAT ADDS GREAT
POSSIBILITIES TO PIANO PLAYING.
THe Piano o/the Future
MESSRS. NICHOLSON & CO. LTD., respectfully announce
that they have secured the SOLE AGENCY for the well-known
RICH LIPP 8 SOHN (Stuttgart)
INTERIOR PLAYER PIANOS
A MUSICAL RENAISSANCE.—The advent of the Player-Piano
is being followed by a great popular awakening of interest in music ; in
fact, the is already doing for music what the invention of the
printing press did for literature. It is widely disseminating musical
knowledge and musical appreciation. Familiarity with the masterpieces
is no longer confined to that small class known as “ Musicians.”
In the past the difficulty has been to secure a Piano by a well-known
maker with the Player apparatus inserted inside. By reading the above,
you will agree we have overcome this difficulty. They are easy to
manipulate. After inserting a music roll you simply work the pedals
with the feet and move four levers in front of the keyboard. The
apparatus causes the piano hammers to strike the strings and produce
the desired tones.
The playing apparatus does not interfere in any way with the Piano.
Should you desire to play the keyboard you can instantly do so, as each
action is independent of the other.
You can buy a Player-Piano on Easy Terms, and if you have a Piano
or an Organ, we will take it in exchange as part payment.

BILIOUS ATTACKS.
There is No More Effective Remedy than
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Piles.
“ I have used Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills for
bilious headaches and indigestion,” says Mrs.
Florrie Yeates, Chapel Street, Marrickville,
Sydney, “and found them an excellent remedy,
and can recommend their use for these ailments.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills relieve this
trouble speedily. They open the clogged-up
system, purify the blood and cleanse the stomach,
causing the human mechanism to work smoothly
and easily. On the appearance of bilious
symptoms a dose from two to four of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills should be taken, the larger dose
for a more robust grown person. A little experience
will guide the patient in the use of the pills so as
to produce the best results. People differ in the
way medicine effects them, and, consequently, no
invariable rule can be given.*

SPORTING
NOTIONS
As the end of the ’oofball season approached in-
terest in Vic. League games centred on the question
whether Essendon or Melbourne will make the fourth of
the semi-final quartette, and whether South will hang- on
to the topmost place, with its double chance for the pen-
nant. “Skinner’s hireling's,” with some luck, decided
the latter question on Saturday, when they scored 41
points to Essendon’s 37, winning the game, just as they
did the previous one against the same team, by a chance
kick at the last moment. The episode was less scientific
than willing, a large majority of the free kicks being given
against the “ Red and White Angels,” as the sarcastic
barrackers call them. The ’Dons, playing better foot-
ball throughout, led by 14 points at three-quarter
time. After that South gathered itself together, flung
skill and caution to the winds, and rushed the ball down
and through by main force. The “same old” strove to
keep the sphere on the wings or out of bounds, or any-
where distant from its own goal, but in vain ; the
Southerners fell on it and their opponents with great
violence, and drove it through once more. South’s bar-
rackers are an ill-balanced lot. They get nasty when they
lose, and when victory comes their way they go dotty.
Consequently, when the “ Angels ” drove the ball down a
third time and someone booted it through, they went
temporarily insane. The ’Don goalkeeper claimed
that his boot touched the article last; the umpire
gave it to South. Rightly or wrongly, the goal, which
meant.Bo much to both teams, was a gorgeous slice of
luck to South, for the ringing bell gave Essendon no time
to reply. A 35,000 crowd, with a liberal allowance of the
“ force,” viewed the occurrence. For somi; abstruse
reason the collision of ’Wood and ’Varsity attracted a full
house, which got equal value for its coin. By the laws of
logic ’Wood should have run over Uni.; but to all ap-
pearance the Magpies were “ mozzed” or something, and
they had all their work to hold their own. Certainl.v the
kicking of the students was a pleasing change from
the samples they have placed on view of late,
and their finish was a thing of beauty ; but
the fact that ’Wood could only make a draw of
it—39 points each—wants more explanation than
this writer has about him. The Magpies are hereby
notified that their recent performances have been both
irregular and unseemly, and if they aren’t altered there
will be trouble. Carlton collided with Richmond and
piled up 100 points to 60 in a cheerful, but vain, endeavor
to collar the lead from South. ’Roy capsized Saints by 77
to 31, and Melbourne downed Geelong by 68 to 45. If
Melbourne can manage to wallop ’Roy next Saturday,
there are possibilities about it ; wherefore this writer
urges it to rush in something extra, if only for the sake
of varying its normal position in the middle of the caval-
cade.
The only notable Victorian Football Ass. dis-
turbance on Saturday concerned Brunswick and Brighton,
inasmuch as the winner would be practically certain of a
place in the “ final four.” The Brickies had the slight
advantage of playing on their own ground, but that
wasn’t near enough to counteract the superior system and
determination of the Bentites, who held a comfortable
lead throughout the discussion, and won handily by
82 to 52. There is still another game of the round to play,
but as Brighton is now a lost proposition for this season,
it may be passed out with a second-class certificate
as a team of somewhat irregular boggers-in who,
in their second Ass. season, made a valiant attempt
to reach the summit, and would have succeeded if
they hadn’t encountered better men, or something
to that effect. Also if they can rid themselves
of the obsession of Bentism they may yet be premiers.
Of the other uproars, ’Town scrambled home from ’Cote
by 57 to 52; ’Scray made sure of its semi-final by notching
52 points to Port’s 38 ; P’ran passed a.dirty doing to
Preston—63 to 35 being the tale thereof; and Essendon
made certain of beating P’ran on points, should the latter
lose next Saturday, by piling up the notable tally of 113
points to North’s 12. It was a considerable feat on Essen-
don’s part, but this habit of leaving things till the last
moment is risky, and calculated to drive capital out of
the country, besides causing other calamities.
As concerns the “ administrative” side of the
game, the explosion of M.F.O.’s sec. Harper faded out to
a mere flash in the pan. That modest gentleman is said
to have met the Ass. delegates privately and assured them
that lie had been misreported, that he didn’t say half he
was said to have said, and that he didn’t really mean
the half of what he had said. Harper may at least
soothe himself with the n flection that the obnoxious
features he referred to are certain to obtrude them-
selves presently, and that he had the opportunity to
tackle them manfully and failed—most grievously. It
isn’t every man who can make for himself the oppor-
tunity, even though he has no use for it when be has
mad it. During the week, the League disqualified two
obstreperous’bailers till the end of next June, the Ass.
wiped out two for a similar term and two for a couple of
weeks, and the Ballarat Ass. fired out, for the term of his
natural life, a player who so far forgot himself as to
“job” the umpire. On the other hand, the Upper
Yarra Ass. is pondering over the action of the umpire
in the match Healesville v. Millgrove. In the last
quarter a Healesville player anathematised the official so
fervent.l.y that he promptly landed the vituperator one in
the eye, whereupon the ’Ville captain, whose team was
then six points to the bad, called his men off the field and
claimed the match. This unusual official is hardly an
ideal umpire ; still, one can make allowances. The aver-
age football governing body is such a subservient, spine-
less affair that this writer would hardly blame an umpire
if he took his defence into his own hands, jumped on the
ball till it burst, and kicked half the players to the far
side of perdition.
* * * *
The All Maoris have gone stale. And small
wonder. The strenuous game they play is all very well
where the turf is a soft cushion on which to fall ; but the
Australian soil, hard as concrete, resents familiarity. The
result is that the whole team is badly knocked about, and
more or less worn out. And when the Maori gets worn
out he is not able to think. So on Saturday last, at
Sydney Agricultural Ground, a comparatively fresh team
of Australians totted up 10 points before the Maorilanders
broke the egg, and finally u r on by 23 to the Maoris’ 16.
The game itself was a good one, although the Maoris
had lost dash and vim, and their speed had been reduced
considerably. Still they played hard, and w’ent down
fighting with their tails nailed to the mast, so to speak.
Great was the excitement in Union circles in
Sydney 7 on Saturday, when Newtown and Glebe met.
Long odds were laid that Glebe would stamp the cham-
pions flat; and the arrogant red team went on to the field
fully believing that its position at the head of the com-
petition would be enhanced b.v the rout of the cheap
drapery 7 suburb. However a high stomach goes before a
puncture, and the fact that the blowing out of
Glebe was delayed till the second half made for
interest. The first half saw a mighty 7 struggle,
in which Glebe had somewhat the best of it, inasmuch as
it crossed Newtown’s line, and Newtown only just
managed to square things with a field goal. With the
score at half-time three all, the excitement among the
25,000 onlookers became intense. A mighty, staggering
kick b.v Jubb gave Glebe a field goal, and there was a
shout of great joy 7 from the men who had laid odds on
Glebe. But so far Newtown had done most of the attack-
ing, and the play had a tendency to roll down to Glebe’s line
which made the barrackers more than anxious. Twice
the Glebe line was crossed, and twice the tries were con-
verted, leaving Glebe a wreck by seven to 13. University 7
and South Sydney should have been a good struggle, and
it was. For close, hard attention to business the
students are to be commended ; but the luck and the
stars in their courses were all against them, bringing
their efforts to naught, and leaving South top dog with
15 to 13. The horrible example of the day 7 was Eastern
Suburbs, which met the despised Sydney, and went
under by 20 to three. Manly and North Sydney made a
draw of it with three points each, and St. George downed
Western Suburbs by six points to three.
Of course the real interest of the scramble
centres itself around the struggles of the A Division,
which includes Glebe and Newtown, South Sydney and
University. The result of the scramble is that Glebe and
Newtown change places, the latter being now on top with
23 points to Glebe’s 22. South Sydney and University are
still in the same order, the only 7 difference being that the
gap between 22 and 14 is somewhat larger than that be-
tween the 20 and 14 that separated them last week.
* * * *
In the Soccer Division the Rawson Cup, which
carries with it the Sydney Metropolitan Championship, is
in its last stage. Only one round has to be played, and
as Pyrmont has 27 points to Rozelle’s 22, it cannot affect
the result. Pyrmont will take the Cup and the champion-
ship, with Rozelle in second place. The only match
played in the competition on Saturday was that between
Sydney and Northern Suburbs, and on paper Sydney
should have eaten Northern Suburbs raw, but it didn’t.
A strenuous game resulted in a draw, with one goal each.
In the Gardiner Cup sudden death competition, Pyr-
mont flattened Glebe out by three to nil, and has
now qualified for the final struggle. Its opponent will be
either Rozelle or Adamstown. P.yrmont’s success this
year has been phenomenal. So far it has not sustained a
defeat in either competition, and in the Rawson Cup and
competition has won 13 gam s and drawn one out of
14 played. “ When shall its glory fade ? ”
* •* » *
The Wallabies refused to cross over to the
League for £5O per man. There is a dark whisper that
some of them demanded a minimum of £l5O each ; where-
upon the League fell down dead three times, and after
that rushed to drink and hanged itself and took poison and
cut its throat and leaped overboard. The body has not
y 7 et been recovered.
* * * *
Apparently, Soccer football is getting a hold in
Victoria. In the final for the Docherty Cup, when Carl-
ton defeated St. Hilda by two goals to one, the attend-
ance was good, and the interest taken indicated that the
most ancient game of them all is gaining ground.
Probably the fact that it is clean (so far) has something to
do with this progress. It is about time Victoria should start
to get sick of the veiled professionalism of the League,
and in a less degree the Association.
* * * *
Maoriland is in a dazed condition, and when it
recovers will probably be in the same state as when Hori
Grey went to govern it—on the verge of rebellion. The
M. Rub:by Union recently asked the English Rugby
Union to arrange for a conference to discuss amendments
of Rugby rules ; and then got a woodener in the eye in
the shape of an intimation that the English Unions would
discuss the matter ; but “ Colonials ” could be allowed no
voice in the matter.

Mr. Alexander Knox, the vice-president and
chairman of the N.S.W. Rugby League—the man who
engineered the revolution that hurled Giltinan, Trumper
and Hoyle from power—is going for a six months’ wander
through the States and British Isles to recover from the
fatigue of his good work. The League will see to it that
he gets a proper send-off.
After being unexpectedly beaten by ’Varsity on
the Wednesday by eight goals to two, the N.S.W. hockey
men put their strongest eleven»into the field on Saturday
for the return match against the Murray Staters. They
scored four goals to one in the first half through the
Victorians’ lamentable habit of wandering at large and
leaving their goal undefended. In the second term the
dark blues played more methodically, and added three
goals to Ma State’s two ; but, as that wasn’t enough to
square the tally, the old lady won the third inter-State
match by six goals to four. The attendance won’t pay
the expenses by several pounds, but hockey is a cheerful
game that may become a national habit when football
and lacrosse have waned and gone down to the bourne
where bear-baiting, archery, and cricket are gone.
The development of the dirigible balloon
threatens to turn Arctic exploration, which was once a
tragedy, into a summer pastime. German}', of course,
will lead the way ; and Professor Hergesell, who is asso-
ciated with Zeppelin, has submitted his scheme to the
Kaiser. Hergesell’s programme is briefly that a special
“Zeppelin ” shall be built for the expedition ; the largest
yet made and a mammoth at that. This craft will sail to
Cross Bay, on the west coast of Spitzbergen, whence ex-
ploratory trips will radiate in various directions. Herge-
sell does not propose to make any “ dash for the Pole” ;
but rather to plod Polewards comfortably and surely, with
plenty of good lager and Frankfurt, and occasional stoups
of sauerkraut on the voyage. Which is, after all, emi-
nently sensible. ThedashforthePoleisoften toomuchlike
the little spring poem which the amateur bard has dashed
off —a failure. The last one fell through for want of one
more horse to eat. Generally there is one horse or one
bear too little, and that wrecks the show.
The Bleriot monoplane No. XI., with which
Louis Bleriot recently won the Daily Mail prize for the
first flight across the English Channel, is the smallest and
lightest monoplane yet made. When the wings are
folded up it is only about the size of an ordinary motor-
car, and with the aviator aboard it weighs only 5071 b.
The engine is 20-h.p.; the spread barely 23ft.; the length
the same ; the area of fabric only 161£ft.; and the weight
carried per square foot is 3'131b. Go on the air, young
man ; it’s simple enough.
The Tour deFrance, which had just commenced
when the last English mail left, is an extraordinary sort
of cycle race, quite unlike anything we have in Australia.
It is a complete circuit of France, which runs into 2800
miles. This distance is divided into 14 stages of any-
thing between 160 and 260 miles ; and spreads over a
month. The towns through which the circuit runs make
high holiday for the occasion, and fSte the riders in the
most liberal fashion. Last year the event was won by
Petit-Preton, after a desperate finish on the Parc des
Princes track, from Faber and Passerieu. This year 150
riders faced the starter.

The world’s cycling championships were decided
at Copenhagen (Denmark) last week end ; but, at time of
writing(Tuesday), no word has come to hand as to how they
ended. Clark having gone dollar-hunting in Yankeedom,
and Ellegmard, holder of the championship, being out of
the running through a fall which injured his wrist, the
chances are that the two French cracks, Friol and Dupre,
fought the matter out between themselves ; unless Major
Taylor, by the way, unexpectedly unwound himself.

South Australia has taken unto itself a long
distance bicycle road race, the promoters being the
Mount Gambier Club. The venue of the run is from
Mount Gambier to Naracoorte and back, a distance of 138
miles. The date is fixed for October 13, and prizes to the
value of £B5 will be battled for.

Most of the world’s out-of-the-way places have
now been traversed by the motor car. Siberia, Mongolia,
Alaska, Central Australia (twice), Central South Africa;
and the last of all, Arabia. And, curiously enough, in
every case the deed was done without loss of life.
They have some peculiar ideas about the “ kaw-
linies” in Britain, and Cycling, the leading English
wheeling journal, recently cast mud on Jack Arnst’s247-
mile ride from Christchurch to Dunedin in 12hr. 21min.,
in this fashion. “It would be interesting to learn how
the distance of 247 miles was arrived at. It is not pro-
bable that across country road in a recently developed
country like New Zealand has been accurately measured ;
in fact, it is far more likely that the distance has been
merely computed.” A glance at the map would have
shown the cheerful ignoramus responsible for the above
that Dunedin and Christchurch are two provincial
capitals, and that the road between them runs practically
along the coast, and is the main highway of the island.
Does Cycling know what a cross-country road is? Also,
a second glance would have shown that the road runs
almost parallel with the railway the whole distance, and
even a sporting writer should know that a railway is
always surveyed. As a matter of fact that road was
accurately surveyed and measured about 30 years ago,
when the country was much younger and less developed
than it is to-day ; so Cycling need not worry as to how
the distance was arrived at.

N. League of Wheelmen is up against it.
The guarantors have received notice to “life the over-
draft and all interest thereon ” ; and as the overdraft is
£l5O, there is going to be some horrible language fly ing
round shortly. It isn’t a large sum, but there are grave
doubts if the League’s attenuated back is strong enough
to stand the weight.
* * * *
The commendable efforts of the police to sup-
press the motor hogs and cycle fiends, who whiz round
the Centennial Park to the danger of the lives of many
little Australians and also grown-up ones, have been
largely frustrated by a gentleman on the Bench who lacks
a sense of proportion. This particular Rhadamanthus let
one “hog” (who, it was sworn, had scorched at 27 miles an
hour) off with a fine of £l. In the interests of the com-
munity, it is necessary that Rhadamanthus’ own irre-
placeable cook should get run over. .
Sydney first-grade cricket will open the first
round on October 2, and in general the sport will
continue in the same groove as last year. Tnirteen clubs
will si ill strive for the premiership, and things will settle
down to a sort of Indian summer after the internecine
strife of the last two seasons. The “ Boundary Com-
mittee’’appointed by the Cricket Association got tired,
or driulk or something, and failed to do anything ; so any
fresh frontier delimination will stand over till next season.

The chief effort of the Australian XI. last week
was to pile up 522 runs for nine wickets against Kent —
one of the strongest bowling t earns in England. Ransford
(189) and Armstrong (107) added 192 runs for the fourth
wicket. The total against Kent is the second highest of
the tour —the previous best being 609 for six wickets
against Essex. As the season comes near its end the
scoring is growing more voluminous.
Maoriland had a glorious time at the Aust.
A.A. Championships at Brisbane last week. It practi-
cally mopped up everything, including the draughts
premiership.
The Australasian Amateur Athletic Associa-
tion threatens to “ bring- out ” R. E. Walker, world
champion sprinter, and the long-distance flyer Hefferon,
for a two months’ tour. The State Associations will
divide the exes, and look after the wanderers while they
are within their particular gates. It seems to take a
devil of a lot of money to support these wandering
amateurs.

The Sydney Sailing Club was the first to come
out of its chrysalis and hold the annual meeting that
precedes the general stirring into life. Things are
healthy, more new boats are coming out, and there is
talk of forming a new club at Mosman. Mosman has
been regarded as the stronghold of the motor launch ; it
is just dotted over with the power craft of the mighty,
and the rise of a sailing club there indicates that our
plutocracy is not effete.
* * * *
The oracles of cricket in England are not
logical in attributing all the success of the Australians to
their superior “ fighting” powers, their superior captain,
and their infusion of new blood. Says one of the lament-
ing London papers:—“We have become too dependent
on the veterans in the field. The new blood of to-day
must be leavened with the blood of to-morrow, as well as
with that of yesterday.” Now, as a matter of fact, the
English team for the first Test match, which it won, was
about the most veteran on record. There wasn’t a drop
of new blood in it, whereas there was quite a lot of new
blood in the fifth team. The feebleness of Maclaren’s
captainship may be admitted, seeing that it has always
been associated with failure in Test matches. But the
lack of “ fighting ” power in a team is mainly a question
of the bowling on both sides. Once in a way England has
fine bowlers—Richardson and Peel of yore were cases in
point—and then the Australians looked to be comparatively
feeble fighters. But, as a rule, the Australian bowling,
whatever may be said of it in this country—is better than
the English batsman are accustomed to, and then they
mostly fail to bat with confidence.
* * * *
Tom Ivory, the octogenarian sport who died at
Lower Randwiek (Sydney) last week, won the first Caul-
field Cup with Master Avenel ; but that was one of the
comparatively recent events in his long career as trainer
and owner of racehorses. Good old white Ivory was a
power on the N.S.W. turf in the 50’s of last century. The
Caulfield Cup dates back only to 1881, and it was long be-
fore then that the Sydney trainer made the first of his
nine unsuccessful attempts to win the Melbourne Cup.
His best bid was with his own horse Sweetmeat in 1879.
Sweatineat ran second to Darriwell, and might have won
only for being interfered with in the straight. Two years
later the same game battler carried 9st. (the top weight)
into third place behind Zulu. That was the last time
that Ivory’s colors figured prominently in the field for a
Melbourne Cup. One of his that carried a lot of money,
but ran badly, was Travertori, in 1869.

The Mclntosh is thinking about retiring from
the p istime of refereeing scraps. At Paris the crowd
rushed the platform, and Mac, who took a vigorous share
in boosting it off again, received a black eye, three bites,
and seven wounds from hatpins. He is now unable to sit
down. Then, a London sporting editor fell on him and
rent him with his pen, writing that he was too little and
too weak to bump the men apart. Certain it is that
London editor has never boxed with little “Mac.” “ Mac”
may not be very big, but he is big enough.

Kid McCoy, a product of the recent Melbourne
novice competitions, met the stocky and experienced
“ Bull” Williams at the Cyclorama the other night, and
put up a display of game, speedy two-handed fighting
which satisfied experts that a new Australian feather-
weight champion is in sight. McCoy made the old ring-
fighter look as slow as a diver and about as dexterous as
an elderly penguin. The fight went the whole 20 rounds,
but only because of “ Bull’s ” bovine capacity for stopping
rapid, hard objects with his fine, open countenance and
feeling little the worse for it. There are some faces you
cannot disconcert with a brick, and Williams has one of
that sort. McCoy won every 7 round, and is now looking
for something superior in his class. If carefully handled,
he should go through the best we have within two years.

“ Micawber ” : Tim Hegarty, one time a
mighty bruiser before the gods, is dead at the early 7 age
of 37. Among his victims at an early 7 age were Abe
Willis, Jack McGowen, Jack Cullen, Fred Williams, Mick
McCarthy, and “ Micko ” Walsh. When Hegarty arrived in
Yankeeland he quickly spread terror and consternation,
and he paid the penalty of greatness. No one his own
weight would take him on, and to avoid starving he had
to concede much meat. During his concessionary period
he bumped James Britt, then in his prime, and the end
was disaster and sleep. Failing to secure any more
matches, Hegarty went on a Bacchanalian tour, and kept
going till at last he was but a remnant from a select stock
of the latest fashion tweeds. And now he has gone for
good.

Bill Squires, who was the lucky or unlucky
drawer of the biggest and roughest farm on the Peel
River Estate (N.S.W.), a patch that was but little adapted
for agriculture, has apparently come to the conclusion
that farming on that sort of land is harder work than
bruising, and he is understood to contemplate an early
return to his old job on quite a large scale. Twelve
months’ battling on that selection may 7 have not only-
enabled him to recover his old punch, but to develop
a new one.

A RHYME OF RAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Melbourne itself has not escaped. Early this morning’
the Saltwater River overflowed its banks. Fleniington
Racecourse was inundated, and the water broke through
on to the low-lying portions opposite the abattoirs.
By 8 o’clock the flood waters were 3ft. deep. The saddling
paddock is also under water, and in the luncheon-room it
is a foot deep.— Victorian flood items.
Oh ! the streaming, teeming rain !
Oh ! the splashing, dashing rain !
How it taps with melting fingers on the icy window pane !
How it roars upon the slates !
How it gurgles ! How it mutters
And the landlord irritates
As it overflows the gutters
And drips in upon the tenant and chokes up the gorged
drain !
Then the tenant grips his brolly and hops round to growl
again
Through the rain—rain—rain,
That keeps falling—falling—falling,
Till the brain—brain—brain
At its mooring chains is hauling.
Oh ! the clatter
And the patter
Of the mad, roof-dancing rain !
Oh ! the rushing
And the gushing
Of the gutter-racing rain !
Oh ! the rain that lies in pools
Just to splash the feet of fools
And the dainty shoes and stockings of the shopping
household Jane ;
How it falls —falls—falls,
Till from hovels and from halls
Goes one frenzied prayer to Heaven : “ Damn this ever-
lasting rain ! ”
Hark ! the wild, teetotal rain !
Hear the Anti-Horserace rain !
Flooding bars and jumps and grandstands with a Judkins-
like refrain !
Tearing pubs up by the roots
In a sort of water madness ;
Swamping paddocks where galoots
Stake their cash and part in sadness
When the slow, well-hated fav’rite fails to pull it off
again,
And is cursed by ev’r.v sportsman ere he hurries for the
train !
Whew ! the rain—rain —rain
That keeps pelting—pelting—pelting
Raises Cain—Cain—Cain
For the land is simply melting
’Neath the blowing
And the flowing
Of the never-ending rain !
’Neath the flooding
And the scudding
Of the lipping-lapping rain !
Oh ! the rain that stings and drives
Makes us weary of our lives,
And faint, gurgling shrieks for mercy come from valley
and from plain
Where we swim—swim—swim
In a twilight dank and dim,
And the turgid flood-tide giggles ’neath the tickling of
the rain.

Child Suffered for Several Years —
Covered with the Humour from
Head to Foot—ltching was Ter-
rible —Tried Doctors, Chemists
and Infirmary Without Result.
NOW WELL, THANKS TO
CUTICURA REMEDIES
"My girl was a sufferer from eczema
for several years. She had been attended
by six doctors and by several of our
local chemists and was an outpatient at
the Infirmary but they all failed to
cure her. We had despaired of ever
getting her cured when a lady—a stran-
ger—advised me to try Cuticura. I did
so with most satisfactory results. She
was covered from head to foot and the
itching was terrible. I used Cuticura
Soap, Cuticura Ointment and Cuticura
Resolvent but I cannot say how long it
took to cure her. It is two years now
since I had the last bottle of Resolvent.
Until I used the Cuticura Remedies I
had no peace, day or night, but thanks
to Cuticura, she is perfectly healthy now.
One of the doctors told me that it was
good stuff when I told him what had
cured my child. You are at liberty to
publish this far and wide. Mrs. Emily
Gardiner, 55, Queen St., Barry, nr. Car-
diff. Wales. July G. 1908.”

NURSE USED CUTICURA
Soap, Ointment and Pills to Cure
Bad Wound on Her Ankle.
'‘The nature of my complaint was a
large wound above the ankle on the
right leg. It interfered with my usual
occupation as a nurse for six weeks for
I was not able to walk to the bedroom
door without help until I began to use
the,Cuticura Soap, Ointment and Pills.
Then, after the first treatment, the cure
began, the pain began to cease and the
sore healed up. Cuticura will do for
others what it has done for me. Mrs.

The Motherland is harassed by a dread that its
prestige in the sport line is going. Follows a list of the
a-lilt-tic contests in which it met defeat during June and
July last: —
Cricket. Won by
June 14, 15, 16 .. 2nd Test Matoll.. .. Australia
July 1,2, 3 .. .. 3rd Test Match.. .. Australia
Polo.
June 23 .. .. Ist Test Match.. .. America
July 5.. .. .. 2nd Test Match .. .. America
Amateur Athletic Championships.
July 3.. .. .. 130 Yards Race.. .. S. Africa
July 3.. .. .. 220 Yards Race.. .. America
July 3.. .. .. Half-Mile Race.. .. Germany
Swimming.
July 3.. .. .. Ist Test King’s Cup .. Germany
Rowing.
Henley Grand Challenge Cup .. .. .. Belgium
In the inter-’varsity cricket match, which was played at
Lords at the beginning of July, t..ree Australians (Seitzs,
Robinson, and Le Couteur) played for Oxford, and the
captain of the Cantabs bailed from S’Afriua. Says London
Daily Mail (6/7/’O9) dazedly apropos the latter:—“To
gain their places in the ’varsity elevens these men have
had to excel the very flower of the great English public
schools.”

Fitzpatrick— who bad the management of Jack
Johnson for two years—wants Bill Lang to go to America
with a view to annexing the championsnip in due course,
but Bill will not leave Australia until he has put some
more local laurels on his fair young brow. He will meet
Bill Squires again (probably in Melbourne during Cup
week) and likewise come to blows with old Bob Fitz-
simmons before deciding on the trip to America, and if he
can’t beat them both handsomely he will stay where he
is. Meanwhile Lang has chucked up football, the
game he played for love. His retirement from the
list of “ muddied ’oafs ” was hastened by an
incident in a recent game between Melbourne University
team and Richmond. One of the University boys, pro-
fessing to have a grievance against Bill for rough play,
squared up to him right there on the field and invited
him to fight. The boxer treated the young bounder’s
challenge as a joke; but it annoyed him all the same,
and next day he handed in his colors to the Richmond
Club committee, with the remark that he had had enough
football.

Queensland is the happy hunting ground of the
spieler. All the so-called games of chance are played
openly, and the law doesn’t raise a fin. The various
agricultural shows are infested with every kind of gun,
and, generally speaking, these guns have a great time.
At Toowoomba show, t’other week, all the old time
swindles—three-card-trick, purse trick, envelope swindle,
wild cat, and the like—were worked for all they
were worth. Two-up was greatly in evidence, and pick-
pockets drove a merry trade. Brisbane is chock-a-block
with betting shops, and guns from southern cities hold up
lamp posts galore. The Exhibition is bound to prove a
mighty fine jubilee for the bloke that lives on his wits,
and unless the law takes a strong grip of things here-
abouts the spieler brigade will get a strangle hold on the
country. Under the reigning conditions the gun is en-
couraged, instead of getting the dirty kick out, or the
cold shoulder, or the glassy eye, or the metallic laugh, or
the boot.

“ J.P.” : It is now possible to gain some idea of
Ketchell’s chances against Johnson. Judging by the
Yankee details, Black Brother gave a very helpless display
against O’Brien at Philadelphia. When the big fellow
stood off and peppered the black’s grinning dial with
quick, shooting blows, the champion’s attempts to
counter with heavy swings were laughable. When it
came to a question of speed and cleverness, O’Brien
feinted his man to death, and had Johnson constantly
throwing up his hands or ducking to avoid blows that
were purely mythical. But when O’Brien faced Ketchell
on June 9 in the same city he found the Michigan boy a
very different proposition. Ketchell, fighting with great
courage and coolness, did anything he liked with his
opponent, and inside three rounds had him doubled up on
the ropes in such a bad state that the referee stopped the
fight to prevent further damage to O’Brien’s beauty.
O’Brien, who ought to know- something about it, now
says Ketchell is the hardest hitter in the world, and that
he will wipe the Black Smudge clean off the championship
roll. He further says, what everybody else is saying, that
Johnson has no punch, and that the only effective gun in
his battery is his right-handed upper-cut. If Ketchell can
only evade that upper-cut for a few- rounds, it is within
the bounds of possibility that the White Race will not
need to call upon Mr. Jeffries, after all.
When bartering about terms with Kauffman,
Brudder Johnsing stipulated that he wouldn’t fight
in Australia. “If I was broke to-morrow and had
a £lO,OOO guarantee for a battle in that golderned
country,” he said, “ I’d rather stay right here in America
and dig the streets.” Yet in Australia he got a fair fight,
and won ; and even after that we allowed him to criticise
George Reid. Now, down in Texas, when he proposed
visiting those parts, they waited up all night with guns
and a hot fire for broiling.
* * * •*
“ Jean Sibi ” offers Melbourne’s furious hoofball
barrackers food for reflection :—“ I have only been a cur-
sory student of Victorian football, but it seems to me that
the game might be improved in one important particular.
At present, when a man bolts with the ball, the rules im-
pose upon him the option of bouncing it every 10yds., or
of losing' it altogether to his opponents under a penalty
kick. Now, connoisseurs of the game will recognise that
a man running with the ball under such conditions will
often provoke the umpire to some dubious judgments.
The umpire, who, by the way, happens to be inferior to
most of the angels, is often forced to discriminate in a
curious way. If, for instance, the running man is bouncing
the ball, and is pushed by a member of the enemy, the
umpire may often have to decide whether he shall penalise
him for holding the ball too long, or, on the other hand,
penalise the pusher for pushing- the push. Followers of
football are well aware of some of the results of those
decisions, and, in former days, w'ere wont to present the
unfortunate umpire with a book of the rules as an ironical
token of respect. Now I suggest that, instead of aiming
language and sarcasm at the umpire, we made it easier
for him by altering the rule regarding the bouncing of the
ball. Supposing that we made it allowable to run with
the ball without bouncing it at all , and further ukased
that a man must drop it immediately he was touched by
an opponent. Would not that guarantee improved and
faster football, as well as relieve the umpire from the onus
of ordering penalties that the modest regard as injudi-
cious, and the immoderate describe in crimson lan-
guage ? ”

An awful thing happened at a small but tony
race meeting in England last month. A totalisator was
being worked in the ring dedicated to bookmakers 'vho
do small ready-money wagerin-- the Little Silver Ring,
in fact; and seeing that the !’ h public thereabouts
had enough horse-sense to begin to perceive dimly the
advantage of being able to make their own market
instead of leaving it to be made and limited by the band
of Noses, the indignant bookies gathered up their
voracious bags and closed their sinful books and withdrew'
themselves from the enclosure. Whereupon the stewards
of the meeting stopped the totalisator, and besought the
Noses to resume pizness, which they accordingly did. In
Britain there is no legal prohibition of the tote, as in
N.S.W. and Victoria, but the racing clubs have not
yet decided to introduce it. Neither have they thought
seriously of drawing any income from betting, save
w'hat they derive from the bookmakers’ payments for
admission to the “rings.” Presently an iconoclastic
steward will suggest the introduction of totalisators,
under club control, and then a storm of opposition will
be raised, no doubt, by the noble lords and other
punters who punt “on the nod,” whilst the slowdy
awakening army of ready-nlbney bettors plead feebly for
a trial of the co-operative system. Finally the question
will be shelved for 10 years, in order that the authorities
may have time to think of what would happen to the turf if
there were no more bookmakers to . bawd the odds on the
course or “milk the dead ’uns”at the betting clubs.
England is the birthplace of bookmaking, and the cry of
“ 2 to 1 bar one ! ” is so hallowed by old associations that
a tote which laid 4 to 1 bar one, after paying a 10 per
cent, commission, would be resented by many good old
Tories as a demoralising contrivance.


Photography
with Films
is very simple

Hi/
SIMPLICITY is the keynote of film photography. If you carry
film there s no dead weight to encumber you, for enough
films can be carried in your pockets to last right through a
long trip. Think of the saving of energy that implies!
Then, too, if you use the tank method of development, the
dark room can be done away with, and the “ drudgery ” of
photography eliminated. Think of the time it saves! The fact
that the entire process of tank development is automatic, places the
merest novice on a par with the expert, and at the same time
protects both from accidents, such as light fog or scratches.
These modern methods have made photography so fascinating
a pastime that all ages, t ranks and sexes are entering into it with
zest. Can you wonder at this ?
The pleasure of taking pictures of your friends, the added
enjoyment to holidays, and the hundred and one occasions when
photography is enjoyable and useful make it a pastime that should
appeal to you. Call at one of our stores and see how the Kodak
works. It's simply perfect and perfectly simple.

IN BANANA LAND
“Leo Lear”: The Lower Burnett has
gone ahead with seven-leagued strides since the
surveyor got to work on the large cattle leases,
and the scenery is changing as fast as it does in
a nine-act bellowdrama. The unromantic cocky
has no regard for ancient landmarks and
legends, but planks his cow-vards on
the old cattle-camp, drives his cream-cans
down the old “bull-pads,” and seeks the elusive
corn-cob on the clearing where Duffurn used to
lift the station’s weaners. Gayndah has been
surrounded by stations since the days of the pro-
phets ; and, like other Australian towns in a
similar situation, it laid itself down to sleep 20
years ago. Now it drowsily resuscitates, and in a
stupefied “ Whaffor ? ” manner looks round to find
further extension blocked on all sides by banks of
prickly pear. Moreover, its title of “Capital of
the Burnett” is being plucked from its brows, or
roof, or wherever it carries the distinction, by
Biggenden. This settlement of the uncouth name
was until recently only a name on the map; but it
is now the centre of a newly-populated area. A
co-operative butter factory is thelatest move there,
and as it will draw supplies from all kine depastured
on the former large cattle stations of Degilbo,
Wetheron and Ideraway, among others, the future
of a local cream-churning plant looks as bright as
any cow-trade venture can be expected to look.
Also, as sugar-growing experiments have given
very satisfactory results, a Biggenden mill seems
to be as probable as a Federal land-tax or an Elec-
tive Ministry ; and those things are dead certain.
The soil in the neighboring Coulstern Lakes scrub
carries a complexion like The Bulletin’s cover,
and the things it won’t grow are about as incon-
spicuous as the things Australia can’t manufacture.
Northward.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A WIND blows up by Conran, with icy
sweep and roll,
A Bird of Desolation, snow-feathered,
from the Pole;
A stinging sleet behind it, a flying scud before,
It mourns among the forests, it wails along the
shore;
When northward from Cape Byron the mangoes
and the maize
To gracious breezes anthem a psalm of sapphire
days;
When northward yet from Townsville is echoed
warm and clear,
A pagan psean pulsing with Summer-all-the-year.
Your cowslips of St. Kilda their daintiness unfold,
Your tulips glad the gardens, your daffodils their
gold
Display in florists’ windows, soft show’r their
blossoms down,
Those orchard trees that flatter the folks of
Plobart town.
But North the white magnolias and red hibiscus
throw
A gleam of blended glory like mingled flame and
snow.
And oh, those Coral Islands along their seas of
blue !
And oh, that strong nor’easter among the tall
bamboo !
The daisies and the hawthorn in ordered walks of
Kew,
The English oaks and beeches are comely sights
to view,
’Tis pleasing, too, to frivol along the Esplanade—
Encased in winter garments—with some town-
talking maid.
But Southern thought is straitened, as Southern
skies are cold,
And South your social virtues are measured by
your gold ;
While North the ice of Custom is melted by the
sun,
The waters of Convention in wider channels run.
The manners of Port Phillip would seem uncouth
and strange
And somewhat out of focus beyond the Blackall
Range;
As curry lacking powder, or custard wanting spice
The virtues of Port Phillip, at Cairns were merely
—vice.
I weary of your winters, their raw winds and
their sleet ;
Your blue-nosed sons of Business who crowd the
hurried street;
Your stately stores and dwellings, bridge parties,
functions, shows;
Dull thoughts like housemaids marching from
villas all in rows.
Dull lines in ledgers volumed, dull loves and dull
intrigues ;
The crowded sub-divisions, the closed unpeopled
leagues;
New riches furred and feathered, sleek sins and
social ills ;
The landlords and the “lydies,” the beer and
butchers’ bills.
I weary of your wasters, who loaf in “Pitt” or
“ Bourke ” ;
The punters picking doubles, the failures out of
work.
The gloordy bards and artists who earn infre-
quent crowns
And browse on counter lunches and curse the
luck of towns.
For mean and sordid worries, for jealousy and
hate,
The railings at 111 Fortune, the winnings at sour
Fate;
For these, or want of money, or over much of
wine,
You cannot find, my cousin, a better cure than
mine :
Pull out, pull out. dear cousin; that narrow-
chested crowd
Will dig along without you, nor shall it weep
aloud
With grief at your departure ; and when the dis-
tance drowns
The echoes of the tram-cars, you will not miss the
towns.
And oh, the green plantations beneath Australian
suns,
And oh, the Wide Australia beyond the cattle-
runs.
To give you joy of motion, to give you sense of
room
A pack-horse out of Bowen, a lugger out of
Broome !
In singlets and cork helmets, in Assam pants
arrayed,
We’ll trek and travel nor’ward to join the White
Brigade,
The Land of Free-and-Easy, where grows the
sugar-cane
And rum and black molasses, has called us back
again.
We’re talking “Thursday pidgin,” we’re smok-
ing fat cheroots,
With something at our heart-strings that pulls
them by the roots,
We’re “to our necks,” fair cousins, of greedy Melb
and Syd.,
The greasy business “guyver,” the silly social
“kid.”
We’re nor’ward bound, sweet cousins, unto a tropic
clime
Of mangoes, maize and melons and Summer-all-
the-time.
We’ve busted up our dollars. Well, let the gilt
go hang,
There’s loot in shell and rubber, there’s silver in
trepan g.
The cowslips of St. Kilda, the ordered walks of
Kew
Are always sweet and proper—we leave them all
to you ;
We’ve pawned our winter garments, impenitent
go forth,
To sword our oysters open, for pearls, along the
North.

THE
RELIGIOUS
MANIAC
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
r T~'HE Lord who lives beyond the Moon
Is brighter than the Sin. at noon !
Though farther than the farthest star
He knows what men and women are !
The Lord who lives so far azvay
Can never hear the sinners pray ;
But righteous people need not fear:
Still will their prayers reach his ear.
For hist! you must not speak of this —
The Lord is mine and I am His.
And He has shown me in my sleep
Who are the goals and who the sheep,
And given me poiver as a priest
To bid to, and bar from the feast —
The Marriage Supper of the Lamb
Whose humble instrument I am.
And graceless goats who would there browse
Shall not come nigh the heavenly house ;
In Outer Darkness they shall wail
Nor shall their prayers aught avail.
But I will curse and harry them
Far from the Nezv Jerusalem ;
And pen them in God's prison grim,
And keep their tears azvay from Him !
Andfire on them shall fall and beat ,
Andflames flare round about their feet ;
And they shall burn and squeal and squirm,
Wrapped round by the Undying Worm !
Bui to the bright Lord I will speed,
And for the Righteous biter cede ;
And they shall walk with harps and crown,
And tread the Godless down — down—down !
The Righteous round the Pit's red rim
Shall stand and sing a joyful hymn,
And praise the goodness of the Lamb
Whose priest and servitor I am.
While I will reach down star by star,
And cast them where the wicked are ;
And burning worlds beneath my feet
Shall be to God a savor sweet !
Far He is mine and I am His —
Of course you must not mention this —
And He has given me the keys
Of Hell to handle as I please. . .
Perhaps to you these precincts seem
Much like the shadow of a dream !
But they are stone, and cause me pain
Because in Heaven I would remain.
Hush ! Go before and with your wings
Hide from me all those hideous things.
Slip off yow; shoes and walk unshod,
And I will take you up to God.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 21, 1909.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The Countess and her Earl spent an hour or so at
the races last Saturday, and saw the worst day
in a frock sense—on record. Mrs. Dudley wore
one of her usual pallid shades —grey this time.
Later she paid a flying visit to the Exhibition
Grounds, where some 400 of Queensland’s brightest
assets were employed in making a map of Aus-
tralia. About the same time his Ex. and the
Hore-Ruthven couple fled in the motor-car to the
Orsova to see sister-in-law Mrs, P. Hore-Ruthven
off on the long sea road to London. And one or
more of them watched the finale of the Marathon
race on Saturday afternoon at the Exhibition
grounds. I don’t know much about the nature of
this event, but I believe the runners start at
Marathon and sprint from there to Waterloo, a
distance of 23 centuries or thereabout. The event,
I believe, is mentioned in Gilbert’s “ Pirates of
Penzance.”
A surprise visit to the Sal. Army’s Prison Gate
Brigade ended the viceregal day on Sunday, the
forenoon having been taken up with the Jubilee
naval and military service in the Domain. Then
the viceroy and party paid a flying visit to Rock-
hampton, and arrived back in town on Friday.
Into the remainder of that day they crowded a
trip to the Exhibition and a visit of condolence to
a broken-legged trooper.
The Lobsters were out in full force on Monday
evening to witness that Empire lesson, “An
Englishman’s Home,” including Julius Brown’s
sudden end, and Beatrice Brown’s soul-stirring
shrieks. Beatrice Brown can shriek. She can
also act, but her shrieks distract attention from
her acting. They are the finest things of the kind
that Brisbane remembers. Of course, the appalling
anti-climax was received with howls of delight.
There was once a lady not far from here who
went a-playing bridge and stopped out late. That
wasn’t so bad ; but she went home in a taxi. Now
even that might have been overlooked if only she
hadn’t, on arrival, discovered the entire household
locked in slumber and realised at the same
moment that she couldn’t get out of her gown
(cut long at the bottom and short at the top)
without aid, unless she rent the garment asunder.
What was to be done ? She looked at the
taxi man (he was young and pleasant), and ex-
plained her dilemma. Now, taxi men are nothing
if not versatile. He rose to the occasion, and,
holding his lamp in one hand, battled away with
the other at the hooks, clips and buttons. All
went well until he reached an inch above the waist,
where the space within waslimited, and thingsthen
came to dead stop. But he declined to be beaten.
He gave the lamp into the hands of the partially
disrobed one, and, with instructions to “ hold it
round at the back,” he fought the last button
with both hands, and won. That would have been
all the episode, only the milkman’s boy was out
driving up the cows, and he told the butcher, who
told the maid at a rival house, and now it’s all over
the town about the lady who was unbuttoned
before daybreak on her own doorstep,
Recent remarks about the curious and untidy
doings in the local civil service have caused the
person whose feelings were most hurt to publish
or inspire an article in his own service review,
which probably had to print the thing. The
article states wildly that the civil service is
quite satisfied, and everything in the garden is
lovely. And dozens of officials laughed horribly
when they read it, for the rottenness of things is
a by-word, and the trail of the money-lender is
over the whole show, and the stories of muddle
and incapacity are hair-raising.
James Blair—fighting Jimmy—has been elected
chief of the Hieiand clan in Queensland. The
presidentship of the Caledonian Society isn’t such
a big thing in itself, but its political significance
is shown when one remembers that William
Kidston and Bob Philp were also nominees for
the billet, and that Blair beat them hands down.
The daily press omitted to mention the election
and the way the bairns of Falkirk had deserted
the old banner.
We have had another visitation ! It is the
Eisteddfod this time, and a cloudburst of talent
has fallen upon us. A queer, demoralising thing
is an eisteddfod. When five choirs have informed
me oftenly that the Lord is their shepherd I don’t
take any further interest in the matter; and when
about ten lots of assorted minstrels have said
“ Come into the Garden, Maud,” my only opinion
is that the garden is too crowded and that there
isn’t any room for Maud. When the 19
mezzos say their “Hearts are Weary,” I say
the same—and so is my head. The only thing
that keeps me awake is the pleasure of watching
Prof. Ives, with his mouth in a flycatcher attitude,
waiting for the false note. The professor says we
have one voice that should make Brisbane famous
—that of Vera Parker, a very young contralto,
whose golden notes, he predicts, will be heard of
one day,
The National Councillors held their annual dis-
turbance on Saturday. Mrs. Joey Bell was re-
appointed president. The Countess assisted the
evening’s proceedings with an address on kinder-
garten. Reggie Roe, who now steers the ship of
Education, also- discoursed, and Captain Rome
came to hold the vice-regal wraps.
Three jolly private dances have been given
during the jubilee whirl. Mrs. Joey Bell and
Mrs. Harry Baynes were hostesses on two nights,
and the Robertson clan filled in a third.
Sincerely yours,
MARIO.
The march of the motor ! Longreach and
Winton have thus far failed to get the 125 miles
that divide them covered by a railway, so a motor
car service has been started. The machine honks
out of Winton one day and honks in the next.


GOLDEN GYMPIE.
Gympie is an example of an alluvial field which
was metamorphosed into a rich reefing area.

Since 1877 Gympie has yielded about
2,875,304 OUNCES OF FINE GOLD,
worth approximately nine and a half millions
sterling.
And Gympie is still one of the most flourishing
mining districts in A ustralia.

Around Gympie plenty of good land is available,
and there are fortunes in the products which
may be grown in the soil as well as in those
which may be dug from it.
The mining community furnishes a market for the
producer, no matter what part of Queensland
his land may be.

THE LURE OF GOLD.—V.
By J. D. FITZ GERALD, BARRISTER-AT-LAW.
Gympie is one of the names which stands out in
the varied and picturesque history of Queensland
mining enterprise. Canoona is the exemplar of
the unsuccessful “rush,” followed by failure,
hardship, and positive distress. Gympie is the
very antithesis of Canoona. It is the exemplar of
success. It was a providential disco very, beeausethe
influences which it set in motion are still eddying
onward. Gympie did this service for the young
colony—it restored confidence, not alone confi-
dence in the ability of Queensland to rival the
southern colonies in the production of the precious
metal; but confidence in the stability of the
colony itself. In 1866 a financial crisis occurred
in the young colony which withered up public
confidence. The hopes founded upon the com-
mencement of a railway-building policy had
been dashed down; settlement was not pro-
ceeding at the pace anticipated ; production
dragged on slowly, and stagnation generally
prevailed. The men in the colony began to
despair; those who could leave, left; those who
intended to come went elsewhere. At this
moment the news came that a fresh alluvial dis-
covery had been made by a prospector named
Nash, while travelling north, at a spot between
Brisbane and Maryborough.
Then came the picturesque features of another
great alluvial rush —this time a successful one.
Though another fate has come to Gympie to-day,

making it a great reefing centre, the traces of the
old workings remain to tell the tale of the first
assault on its treasures. The scarred, torn sur-
faces of the ground, the small mounds of the
“tailings’ heaps, the holes—some fallen in, some
failed up—all give evidence of the feverish on-
slaught made upon the earth in order to drag her
guilty secrets from her. As the scientist can re-
construct a mastodon from a few bones, so we may
reconstruct the busy mining rush of the year 1867
from the traces of to-day—the rough, bearded men
who flocked in upon the reported discovery of
payable gold by Nash ; the primitive city of tents
which soon sprang up; the sinking of shafts—the
f h Trom^
the cosmopolitan settlement, with the British
peoples as the foundation, and blended, the Ger-
man, Frenchman, Italian, Pole and, above all, the
Hebrew, generally as storekeeper, gold buyer and
financier. Often in this capacity the Jew found
himself in competition with the Chinaman, who
also was gold buyer and general storekeeper, but
rarely a speculator as the Jew was.
Around the men who were “on the gold ” a
community sprang up of traders, hotelkeepers,
caterers, tradesmen, all risking much, for there
was nothing to guarantee to them that Gympie
would be more permanent than Canoona. They
all took risks; the whole thing was a sublime
piece of gambling; an adventure of an heroic
nature, which, fortunately for the adventurers
and for Queensland, “ came out all right.” No one
could then, in a prophetic mood, have predicted
the 2,375,394 ounces of gold, which have been won
from Gympie alluvial and reef mining—nor could
anyone have conceived, in their wildest dreams,

CHINESE MARKET.
that the field would —up to the end of 1907 —pro-
duce gold of the value of £9,501,216.
In the early days of gold prospecting, the lucky
digger who “ struck a patch ” did all he could to
screen his operations from the observation of
others. Thus it is related that three Frenchmen
who had located gold on Canal Creek, near the
Darling Downs, hid their secret so closely that it
was not for some years that they were disturbed
in their stealthy operations, and their good
fortune shared by others. Nash, the prospector
who discovered Gympie, worked on for
sonl e time, despite the bait offtfred'bvtbeGovern-

of the reefs, and here another romantic chapter
opens in the story of Queensland settlement.
The reefs, when opened, showed fabulous golden
contents the veritable “jewellers’ shops”
of mining metaphor. “Four men” (says the
author of “Resourceful Queensland ”).“ in six
weeks, from a space only measuring 20 feet, got
£15,500 worth of gold.” If the fever was intense
on the discovery of alluvial gold, if Jhe excite-
ment blazed almost into flame when a lucky digger
found a nugget weighing 804 oz. and worth nearly
£3216 —what must it have been when men, with a
pestle and mortar, or with even more primitive im-
pliments, were getting at the rate of IOOOoz. to
the ton of quartz ? This was before the days of
machinery.
No wonder that the picturesque incidents be-
came more lurid. Primitive passions were aroused
by the presence of great wealth in a small com-
pass, while the police services of Government
were inadequate if these passions had broken out,
to control them. But the pioneers of the mines
in Queensland were law-abiding men; and
though, from time to time, the “ mates ” who had
“struck it rich” felt it incumbent upon them
to go through the form of self-protection by
watching in turn, with revolvers loaded, the rich
spoils of their newly-discovered reefs, there was
no lawlessness of the kind which we read of in
regard to the mines of the United States—lawless-
ness upon which a distinctive American literature
OP s»x- xSffs&s&i
“poor man’s” goldfield, in the sense that every
miner had a prospective fortune in his swag. But
it became a more stable poor man’s field in the fact
that the days of the wage-earners began, and the
often fortune-favored opportunities of the “ tribu-
ter” i.e., the miner who works for a percentage of the
gold which hi * labor wi “s from a mine owned by
a company. The steady investment of capital in
Gympie mines continued, and such enterprises as
the “Scottish Gympie’’ and “Great Eastern No.
2 South ” —of world-wide repute—are the result.
It was the reefing stage of the Gympie field which
attracted from afar the young Scottish miner who
recently, at a most crucial time in the history of
the Commonwealth of Australia, held the reins
of power and controlled the destinies of the nation.
It was in such reefs that he worked underground
until brought to the surface by his comrades and
sent to represent them in the State Parliament in
Brisbane, and afterwards to the Federal Parlia-
ment in Melbourne. The pick of the miner has
been discarded for a mightier instrument—the
pen of the Cabinet minister. Richelieu is made
to say in Lytton’s play that—-
Beneath the rule of men entirely great
The pen is mightier than the sword.
That pen is, of course, also mightier than the pick
—though there is much evidence, not only on the
scarred and tunnelled crust of the earth round
Gympie, but in the vaults of London, Berlin,
Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, that the pick, as
a symbolof a marvellous progressiveness in ayoung
nation, is not to be despised. In the connection
in which they are mentioned now, the pick and
pen take this significance, which will be appre-
ciated by the toiler in Britain, Germany, France,
or any European nation —or even the great demo-
cratic Republic of the West—that it is a symbol of
a free democracy, which opens all avenues, even
the highest rewards of statesmanship itself,
to the man of ability who is worthy of pro-
motion. Of no country can it be so truly said, as
the fact proves in Queensland, that “the office is
open to the man fittest to fill \t”—La carrier e
ourerte aux talents; the Napoleonic maxim of
efficiency.
Gympie has had a wonderful past—its future
will be no less wonderful. Though there is no
great spurt in gold production to-day, expert
opinion is not wanting that newer and richer zones
of gold-producing “ black slate’’ (the distinctive
formation in which the gold is found in this field)
will be opened out. There was a period of panic in
the earlier days, when the gold-bearing strata
“ petered out.” But bold hearts did not despair,
and as has been the case with both Queensland
and Victorian mines, the strata lower down, when
tested, proved to be richer than that in the
shallower levels. The scientists are obtaining a
better grip of the geological formation, and as
time goes on will be better able to direct the opera-
tions of those who have invested their money in
mining. As W. H. Traill shows in the “Official
Year Book,” Gympie was in despair when the
reefs ceased to be gold-bearing when a depth of
200 ft. had been reached. Even the geologists
abandoned hope; and it required men with grit
enough to spend their money in the teeth of
expert advice to go on long enough to get through
the unproductive stratum until they reached the
second body of ore. As part of the history of the
past, and the promise of the future, the romance
of the Gympie goldfield should be worth studying
by the intending immigrant.

in the battle Of life. Life’s battle is a hard one, and you must have steady nerve, a clear brain, and muscles like
bauds of steel. The weak man or woman must give way to the strong, the robust and the vigorous. Your health and
physical vitality should be guarded as the miser guards his gold. Dr. McLaughlin, the electrical authority, has discov-
ered the true method of applying Electricity for the perfect cure of the ills and ailments
of mankind. Electricity is Nature’s Remedy. There is not a weak person in
this whole world to-day who cannot become strong, healthy and vigorous again if they
will only apply the right current of Electricity. We have a method of applying Electricity
for the cure of the various weaknesses of men and women which will cure in every case.
Our method of applying Electricity is fast supplanting the use of drugs all over the world.

DRUGS ARE USELESS!
Drugs cannot and will not cure the Nervous Ailments and Weaknesses of Men and
Women, such as Loss of Vigor and Vitality, Rheumatism, Kid-
ney, Liver and Bladder Troubles, Constipation, Stomach
Disorders, ete., etc. Nature never intended a man’s stomach to be the
receptacle for strong drugs, and if you persist in their use it will not be long until
you will be beyond curing ; your stomach will be totally destroyed. Electricity,
when applied by Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt, gives to every part
of the body—as it travels over the nerves—strength and vitality, and quickly
drives out disease, no matter where it is located. When you are weak there is
simply a lack of Electricity in the system—not enough electricity to keep up your
nerve force—and before you can again be restored to vitality and vigor electricity
must be supplied. Weakness defeats the aim or ambition of man. The weak
man must be made strong before he has the necessary energy and brain power to
succeed. Electricity builds up the shattered nervous system, restores strength and
vitality, makes rich, red blood ; it is the bulwark against which disease must fall. It brings
the sunbeams of happiness and health into a life which has been darkened by weakness. We have thousands Of
testimonials to prove all our assertions. Our belt is simple, easy to use and is guaranteed to give a strong current.
It has special attachments fop men and women. They are within the reach of all; price £1 and up.
Beware of cheap imitations.

RUPTURE IS CURABLE!
NO matter how long you have suffered ; no matter how long you have been
putting up with the inconvenience of a truss; no matter what doctors have
given you up-REMEMBER THERE IS HOPE !
Rupture is curable by Dr. J. A. Sherman’s Method—a method which has proved
successful in hundreds of cases of many years’ standing. Full endorsement of this
statement will be given to enquirers.
Note this significant testimonial :
Heriot, N.Z., December 28, 1908.
Dear Sir, —My four children treated by you are all cured. One boy, 11 years old, had been
ruptured for ten years; the girl, 8 years old, had been ruptured for two years ; another boy,
6 years old, ruptured since a baby, and the youngest, lj years old, also ruptured since a
baby. I say Dr. J. A. Sherman’s Method is a great boon to humanity, as I am convinced it
is a certain cure for rupture. Yours gratefully,
Mrs. W. M. MCDONALD.
Call or write for two books which treat very fully on this subject. We send
them free on request.

Some unheroic remarks about cabmen and
taxicabs:—
Oabmen are accidents. No young man ever sets his
teeth and says, “I will be a cabman ! I will give up
smoking and drinking, devote my nights to studying the
traffic regulations and veterinary science, and gradually
work up until I become a cabman l” No ! Cabmen are
just accidents—like most other varieties of robbers. With
the taxicab coming round the corner of the near future,
I refuse to raise a lament over the passing out of the cab-
man. I fear and hate cabmen. I only use cabs when I
am forced to, and when I do I overpay the driver to an
extent that makes him incoherent with joy. In conse-
quence of this cowardly habit cabmen are always abjectly
grateful to me, and one or two have dropped the reins
and burst into tears when they saw me coming. This
display of gratitude would not be altogether unaccept-
able if I could spare the money and was not afraid of
them ; as things are I can’t spare the money, and I am
afraid. So, when a cabman thanks me, I feel I want to
drag him from his cab by the hair of his head and throw
him into the middle of next week, so that he won’t be
found or seen again until the ensuing Wednesday’. It
would be a picturesque revenge, and would vastly’
astonish the grateful brigand ; but. unfortunately, I am
not sufficiently’ powerful to do it. Some day’, when I
meet a strong, wrathful man, I will confide that dream to
him, and take him about in cabs until I find a specially
offensive driver. Then I will rush my friend into the
conflict and watch him slay the vehicle in cold blood.

I take that when nothing else will give relief. One

able. I have several times given a bottle to suffer-

Where the hills are tall and timbered, and

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BATLEY was nearly done. Horses and
stores had been abandoned leagues back ;
his black had deserted ; and Batlev was
lost, not knowing, even within 290 miles, "what
part of the country he was lost in.
The last time he had taken an observation, or
had possessed an instrument to take it with,
seemed ancient history, if he ever thought of it’
for Batley’s mind was unhinged with his woes,'
and he realised little except, in a dull, mechanical
sort of way, that the wilds were shortly going to
swallow him up.
The only thing he could not forget was thirst.
He saw water everywhere—water that, when he
clutched at it, crushed up in his Angers like dried
caves and grass. Not that there was no water
about; but the spinifex plains had taken too
much out of him. He was incompetent to find
water now. Fifty yards seemed miles, and the
thirst was being pushed out by another yearning
—for rest—rest for his weary bones, everlasting
rest. Was that shady spot, or that, or that the
place where he would sink down for the last time?
He did not fight against the feeling long. There
was sweetness in the idea of rest, so presently
down he flopped.
Then Batley saw visions again. A few yards
away a young woman, beautiful and naked, stood
staring at him. The sun lit her up in her round-
ness and softness and unconscious magnificence of
pose, as she poised with uplifted arm, a vessel of
water on her head.
Naturally Batley only took in one thing in all
the picture—the vessel of water. It was a kind
of bucket roughly chopped out of a piece of fern
tree trunk, somewhat porous, for he could see the
maddening liquid dripping from it in clear sprint
diamonds on to the bearer’s pearly shoulders.
Helplessly beating his hands in front of him at
this most cruel vision of all, he tried to speak
Water ! Water ! Pour it on me ! Drown
me in it! his soul would say; but from his baked
mouth came no adequate sounds, and in the exer-
tion and excitement of it together the fool of a
Hatley fainted.
When he came to himself, unless that, too, was
part ot the dream, he was wet enough—drenched
With water in fact—and she was there putting
pa msful of it into his mouth, his head being
pillowed on her arm. °
That went on for a long while—long enough for
BatJey to notice the girl had turned into a man
naked, and with the long flowing hair still, but a
young man beyond doubt.
This did not astonish Batley at all. He was
taking things as he found them! S
Long before Batley was tired of it. the youth
got him up to help him to somewhere. Batlev
was only apprehensive at losing sight of the fern
!mkfnpH hIC ! h ' S nake - d guide left behind > and
contained water —precious water.
other naked human forms appeared. Two
"i three youngsters ran up and wonderingly kept
by them. Then a short, thick-set, grey-bearded
male transpired—a male with big limbs, a tanned,
hairy Hercules. He was followed by the rest of
the family, including the maiden of his vision,
illuminatingly like her brother.
Batley was not at all shocked that all these
individuals were as in the costume of the sun cure,
mother-naked. He was scarcely surprised. It
wtis not worth troubling about. Nakedness was
evidently the fashion there. Perhaps they were
a new tribe of white aborigines. It didn’t matter.
His own clothes were the real anomaly, so worn
you could see the most of him through them. He
nearly blushed for shame, and hoped they would
not notice.
Their faces were kindly, all except that of the
old man. whom he thought he caught scowling
once or twice. Not a word of English did any of
them seem to understand when he found his
tongue.
The small fry were jubilant. One of them, a
little savage of about ten, catching Batley’s eye
pointed up a big gum and then let fly a waddy!
Down came a bright plumaged parrakeet, which he
promptly presented to Batley. That famished
wanderer thought he was intended to eat it raw
and nearly started to do so. But they got him
inside their dwelling—part logs, part sods, con-
taining one single, but sizable, apartment
A large pieceof thick bark, indifferently flattened
out, was mounted in the centre fora sort of table
and there were logs and stones about to sit on 1
opears and clubs were handy on racks, and one or
two nets, roughly made with raw river flax were
hanging about.
Batley noticed these things as they were around
feeding him. The provender consisted of some
kind of coarse meal bread and pieces of cooked
wild turkey. He ate with his fingers, scooping
up water in his hands from another fern bucket’
whenever he wanted it, as the rest did.
He stopped eating at last, because the eldest
nude female, the mother of the family, took the
tood away for his good, he reckoned, not from
any parsimony. Then she made signs to him to
stretch out in a corner and go to sleep. He did
so, and dreamed more dreams.
When lie woke again, refreshed and hungry he
seemed to have been sleeping for about two days.
tie sat up in the bed—just a heap of dry grass on
the ground—and took a look round. No one was
about. Noticing that he was stark naked he
went to dress himself, but could not see his things
a i:. yw !'f e - N T could he remember taking them
ott. the amiable savages must have stolen his
clothes somehow while he was asleep.
He sat there thinking about it, looking with
intent at a bundle of kangaroo skins near him so
unused is civilised man to having nothing on.
Hearing noises outside, he spied through a con-
venient opening and found the family were
engaged running races and in other athletic exer
c ’ s ®f; °t, the youngsters saw Batley’s head
at the hole. This stopped the proceedings, and
caused them to all tumble indoors and set about
preparations for a general meal. Presently there
appeared a big wooden platter with what looked
like hot fresh roasted rabbits on it. It was
planked down on the “table,” where there were
already some bread cakes and some pineapples
Dinner was set.
I here was a good deal of business that was un-
intelligible to Batley, but he understood well
enough when he was signed to occupy one of the
stumps and fall to. He felt slightly ridiculous in
his bare condition, but as no one took any notice,
not even the beauteous Diana of his first vision,
he was shamed out of his squeamishness. Once
seated round the table, the matter of clothes was
not so embarrassing. The old man deftly hacked
off small joints with two sharpened pieces of bone
and the rest held them in their fingers, and fell to!
During the meal, he noticed something dangling
over the table at the end of a string. He looked
at it more closely. It was a shilling. As he let
it go, he caught old Hercules frowning at him
again.
But, whoever these people were, Batlev became
one of them, and in a few weeks’ time he was used
to their mode of life and, as you might say, was
of the family. They hunted together, cooked
together, ate together and gambolled together.
Their methods of making each other understand
were soon picked up, being mostly very evident
signs, with an aboriginal expression here and
there, and even a word or two of English. This
hist circumstance confirmed a conclusion that
Batley had already come to, that really they were
of Anglo-Saxon origin, strange as it might appear.
They seemed to have no names, but called each
other by imitating some distinctive animal or
bird cry such as “ mopoke,” which was the sign
of the youth whom Batley always thought of as
Adonis, as he thought of the eldest girl as Diana
and the father as Hercules. The sign for Batley
was the cry of the whip-bird.
The least companionable of the lot was the boss
of the pack—the dad—who seemed to shun any
attempts whatever at intercourse; but Batley
soon got on passable terms even with him.
Diana was quite a beauty, and in the first shock
of this nude existence she had been more em-
barrassing to Batley than all the rest put together.
But he had got over it all, and could now hold
her hand in the moonlight for hours with almost
as little bashfulness as she.
He even set himself to teach her to talk and
understand English, so that he would be able, when
he went away, to make a speech, through her
thanking the whole family for the uniform kind-
ness he had invariably experienced on all occa-
sions, etc., etc. He would have made a fine mis- I
sionary, Batley would.
But that marvellous mystery, or lunatic, or both,
her walrus of a dad, came across the grammar
class one day and blew up like a burst boiler,
making relations quite strained for a while.
Evidently the unteachable old savage was de-
liberately bent on keeping the others as savage as
himself. Resentment swelled behind Batley’s
breastbone, and his life soon became a brooding
on conundrums that took up a lot of his spare
time.
One day the boys, smart as blacks at noting
every little mark, sprung some fresh kangaroo
tracks. I hen spears and some skins were brought
out, and the boys chopped off bushes sufficiently
tall to hide themselves behind. Batley was given
one, and all the male hands made off, following
tne tracks at a great rate.
After about an hour they stopped, and the old
man and Mopoke dressed themselves up in the
skms as kangaroos, and the others, with their
bushes held in front of them, went forward more
cautiously.
linding three fine roos browsing in a clear
space, the boys (with Batley) advanced gradually
towards them behind their bushes and got fairly
close. Then Mopoke began showing himself, in
fine kangaroo style. The biggest of the real
animals looked at him with interest.
• 4 Jt t' ho ', l § ht of went by the board, for
just then the old man hopped in, and itmadeupits
mind about him without any reflection. It came
on like lightning with its dangerous hind feet. But
the old man stood firm as a rock, his strong spear

L SYDNEY lAN CURED* ' !
Mr. M. J. Grace, of 102 Darling Street, Glebe, Sydney, late Farrier-
Sergeant of the First Regiment, wrote from Klip Drift, South Africa, March 1,
1901 :—“ lam very pleased to state that we have your famous Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills in the midst of our regiment. I was very much troubled in the
early part of the campaign with pains all over me, especially in the back. You
see I was always trekking about in bad weather, and sleeping on the damp
ground, and one would want an iron constitution to withstand the inroads on
the system. Many mornings I have tried to get up, but failed until I obtained
assistance. My agony was often so bad that I felt inclined to rush into the zone
of the enemy’s fire and put an end to my sufferings. All the military doctors
who treated me failed to do me any good. One day a comrade gave me three
boxes of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and told me to try them. The first
box eased me greatly, the third box completed the cure. Many of my com-
rades used them, and they swear by this wonderful medicine. Indeed this
testimony expresses their gratitude to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills as well
as mine.”
Eight years later, Mr. Grace says : —“ lam still quite free of Kidney
Trouble, and have been during the past eight years. Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills cure to stay cured.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cure Inflamma-
tion of the Kidneys and Bladder, Pain or

Piles
Cured After Years of Suffering-
Proof that Doan’s Ointment
Will Cure Piles.
Piles rarely kill, but they cause constant
torture. This is especially true in the case of
those who are ever so slightly constipated.
Piles can be quickly and permanently cured
without pain, cutting, or detention from
business. This has been proved in thousands
of cases of both sexes and of all ages, and in
the very worst as well as in ordinary cases.
No one who has not suffered the tortures of
itching, painful and bleeding Piles can appre-
ciate for a moment the marvellous sense of
relief that follows the use of Doan’s Ointment.
Go at once and get a pot of this ointment; it
will end your sufferings.
Mrs. F. Flynn, Melbourne Cleaning and
Dyeing Co., 232 Darling Street, Balmain,
Sydney, says: “No one likes their health
troubles to be made public, but if the know-
ledge will be the means of saving other people
years of suffering, then I think it a duty to
make a public statement. For over 12 months
I suffered from protruding Piles; the pain of
this terrible complaint prevented me from
getting proper rest at night, and so I could
not do my work. I was really in a bad state,
and the pain nearly drove me mad. I cannot
now remember all the remedies I used : I got
everything I heard about, but it was only
waste of time, for they did not even give me
ease. When at my worst, I commenced using
Doan’s Ointment. I got immediate relief,
and one pot cured me. I earnestly recom-
mend all sufferers to try this wonderful Oint-
ment.”
Two years later Mrs. Flynn has something
else to say on this subject : “ I have now had
time to test my cure, for it is two years since
I used Doan’s Ointment, and I am pleased to
tell you that I am still free of the torture of
Piles. I cannot find words to express my
gratitude to Doan’s Ointment for my per-
manent cure.”
When we say that Doan’s Ointment will
cure Piles, we mean exactly what we say,
nothing more or less, and it is because of the
thousands who have been cured that we are
able to say this. The above is one instance ;
we have similar testimony from every town in
Australia. Doan’s Ointment is sold by all

out a yard or so in front of him so that the animal
just spitted himself on it. Also he got one in the
neck from Mopoke that settled his hash.
The boss was on his feet again directly, volubly
excited about the two other kangaroos, and roar-
ing out in good English to the boys, “Let drive
at ’em ! Let drive ! What are you waiting for?”
But Batley did nothing but drop his spear
and stand stock still looking at him. The old
fraud himself, realising his slip, could only stare
back helplessly, his face a disgusted red and his
’roo skin, disarranged in the scramble, half on
and half off.
Next morning Batley, on waking, found his old
clothes alongside him, patched in a serviceable
manner, and fit for a long journey.
It had crossed his mind before that he belonged
to Melbourne, Australia, which continent he
supposed himself still on, and where there were
no doubt anxious people who might have to be
thought of some day. But he had always post-
poned this question. Now he was almost glad
that things were brought to a head by what
seemed a notice to quit.
He would soon know something about the
family now. Old Hercules must have something
or 6ther to say before he went, and the burly
ancient must cast some light on the midsummer
madness of their existence.
As a matter of fact, Batley and Diana’s father
did find themselves met, as man to man, for some
such purpose very shortly. Batley had his duds
under his arm, rolled up as he had found them.
He knew better than to put them on, to be laughed
at by the women and boys, until he had absolutely
got to. He was so used to going about in his
plain skin now that the bare thought of getting
into clothes again gave him the creeps.
The color of his own skin was now tan, like all
the rest, and the soles of his feet were thick and
hard as leather. Fur and a tail would only be
questions of time.
There was a long silence. Batley at last said
“Good-morning,” and, getting only a nod and
grunt in reply, he plunged disgustedly into
business.
“ What direction do I go?”
Then .Hercules, after carelessly pointing, pro-
ceeded at last to loosen his tongue.
“It strikes a Government road about 90 miles
off. The boys will see you through. You will
take supplies for a fortnight, for you may have to
wait there several days.
Thus far, he spoke very deliberately, as if
choosing his words, or as saying a speech prepared
beforehand. Now he continued more freely :
“ You are free to stop on if you like. We have
no quarrel with you. But it would be unwise.
You belong to civilisation, and would regret it in
time —when it would be too late. You belong to
civilisation —we don’t ! We’ve done with it, and
are working back. Man should have stopped at
the brutes. They still have natural affections ;
man has improved it away —even his heart’s arti-
ficial. I’d rather be a wild ape than move among
’em again !”
There was so much bitterness in the words that
Batley’s desire to question and to know things
further was all withered up.
He found a big hot breakfast in preparation at
the camp. All hands were busy and hearty as
usual, and everything was on the same old joyous
footing. Diana, fresh as the morning, with the
sun playing about her hair and her glowing skin,
was as gav as the rest, and further unsettled
Batley’s mind. '
So Batley set about the business of departure.
They were to be off (he and the boys) secretly one
morning after breakfast. Batley was going to
have no good-byes.
The naked mother, somehow, got to be an excep-
tion, and went on very like a human being at the
severance of the one link that connected her with
the other world. She broke out passionately and
shed a light on the myster3\
“It was a wicked, wicked will that did it —
nothing else in the world ! ”
“Will?”
“Yes, the wicked will of an unjust father !”
But that was all he got. She shut up like an
oyster. So presently the four brown bodies, with
their impedimenta, were started on their 90-mile
journey.
Batley, out of spirits all the time, did not even
revive at the sight of a real telegraph line and a
cart track. Beside the track they camped for a
week, waiting to see what might pass.
Up to this time Batley’s clothes were wrapped
in a bundle, but now he put them on to play his
part of shipwrecked overlander. So long they
waited that he began to cheer up at last. It
looked like the will of Providence that he should
go back with the boys. Then they heard a distant
whip-crack, and down that hope went. And
finally two bullock drays came lumbering along
laden with dried skins, and the drivers took
Batley back (the boys being in hiding) towards
where people were clothed and in their right
minds.
But Batley sulked all the way and everywhere
—in drays, on coaches and horses, and on foot.
It was all one to him. He should have been
carried at corpse rates wherever he went for all
the cheery company he was. For he was industri-
ously brooding about “a wicked will” and the
shilling that someone had been cut off with—the
bob that was suspended over the table —and the
disappointed legatee, and he also thought of
Diana.
After his other travels there were train rides.
It was holiday time—there were holidays even in
civilisation, it seemed—and a compartment he
managed to squeeze himself into was standing full,
and everyone was jolly. The folk perpetrated
songs. A bright little thing of about 15, jammed
right up against Batley, sang “Castaway,” a
plain, unvarnished taleof sordid love,seduction and
desertion. She also sang “ Divorced ” and “ Met
Again”—more heartrending still; but none of it
comforted Batley.
When at last he got round to Melbourne he
made a little stir. He had been given up for lost,
and his reappearance was good newspaper copy
for a day or two.
His mother was very pleased to see him, and
took him thankfully to church with her, remark-
ing afterwards that she thought the Litany never
sounded so beautiful. Batley prayed for help and
succor for all such as were “ working back.”
His friends said he was a changed man: but,
plunging into incessant work like a horse, he im-
proved in time. He got a book out, and lived
quite another lifetime. He dulled even memory
itself in a humdrum of mere moroseness, en-
livened by profanity at printers, so that Batley"s
life became much calmer in a year or so.
Of course, he would be off again somewhere,
some day, and he might even wander up and rout
out those people yet.
But one day, while rushing down Collins-street
in hot haste to the printer’s, anxious not to forget
the exact terms of some vituperation he had
devised for the occasion, he heard, sharp and
startling, the cry of the whip bird—the “ O-o-o-
whippp ! ” sacred to him alone as his call in
another world. Why, Diana herself had called
him with it a hundred times, and this was so
shockingly like it that here in the crowded Block
he was brought up standing—all attention.
It came from some jolly person in a big motor
car, engaged apparently in driving a party of
gypsies round the town. He was grinning in
Batley’s face as if delighted to make a fool of him.
Not satisfied with that, he was nodding and nod-
ding and nodding with his big head as if he knew
him, and so were the lot of them. Some of the
youngsters were shouting and whip-birding again,
attracting everybody’s attention.
And Batley, instead of walking on and taking
no notice, gazed at them in a sort of mesmerised
way and then went for the car ir. a bee line, as mes-
merised people do, without even begging pardon
of persons he bumped on the way—well dressed
people, too.
And then, afterwards, he squashed into the car
himself and went off with the party, forgetting all
about the printer. It was a big family party—a
stout dad with a pointed beard, an embonpoint
mamma, and a number of assorted daughters be-
having with an extraordinary mixture of gladness
and confusion and merriment.
Of all the talk and jabber they had together not
more than a dozen words are worth repeating
here.
“Working back? 0 that’s all right —the will
was a forgery ! ”
G. BRON.
The Return.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
RED even lies on the unruffled stream
Like fire on a drawn sword, and through
thin mist
Blossom and bloom grow gold in one last gleam
About the altar of a passioned tryst.
Out of the dim green silence cries upstart
Where leaves and lovers bend and whisper
and kiss ;
“ Sweet sight, sweet sound, sweet odor, Ah,
sweetheart,
Stay by me till to-morrow cndeth this !
“ For now the moon upon the mountain looks,
Stirring to fire even that face of stone,
Brimming my heart with music like the brook’s
Till I must sing to it, ah, why alone?
“ Sweetheart, look out, my ship’s upon the sea,
Yet not in that broad deep shall love be lost;
Unto the white-armed shore the wave breaks free,
Far morrow shall be fairer for the cost. ”
The old moon fades, the new moon dawns, the
stream
Smiles at the stars and drowns with even sound
Sighs in the night, and glimmers, all a-gleam,
Like her slow tears, and the wheeled year drives
round
To singing spring once more, and still the air
Smells sweet with promises that waver and
burn
Like incense, and again she hears him swear,
“Sure as the moon returns shall I return.”
The old year fades, the new year darwns, the
light
Lies on the stream like fire on a drawn sword ;
Whisper on whisper rustles in the night,
O new-found lover, old forgotten word !
For, “Ah,” she sighed, “I wait so long alone,
While green earth beckons and its shady groves
Invite, and last year’s vows and leaves are strown
Grey in the dust; but my young heart is love’s.
“ And if his voice returns, it is not strong,
But a thin whisper ; and his face a shade
Thrills me no more. O heart, it would be wrong
Still to deny thee, of a ghost afraid.”
Beyond the unheaving ocean the broad sun
Halts on the veldt to beckon evening on ;
Black broken outposts of a battle done
Lie man and rifle, and the last light’s gone.
The last light’s gone, the last light of the day
That is her bridal day ; and now the dead
Twist in their clammy graves, and through damp
clay
Creep out into the moonrays overhead.
Slow hoofbeats tramp, and groom and bride draw
nigher;
The groom bends over and the bride’s eyes
' shine ;
A shadow in.the path of misty fire,
A voice out of the darkness, “ Thou art mine.”
“ Mine though I buried am ; the creepy grave,
The wind-washed veldt imprison me in vain ;
To this light breath some Power of Darkness gave
Force to return to our old ways again.
“ By deeds and words the living and the dead
Are bound in brass ; undying passionate vows
Out of the darkness draw me ; soft words said
Shall twine like iron round your heavy brows.
“ To you that would forget me, now no more
Kisses shall come ; but you shall feel my face,
Misty and cold ; his footsteps at the door
Like mine, shall faintly sound ; in his embrace
“ This shadow that I am shall yet obscure
All that you ventured for; in the light breeze
I shall bend down and whisper, like a wooer,
And beckon in the wavings of the trees.
“ This is no will of mine that drives me on ;
I do but drift and flicker in some wind
Whose source I know not; for I would be gone
Into the drowsy grave with quiet mind.
“ Blossom and bloom enfathom me no more
With pleasant calm, nor green earth gladdens
me,
Only the tide forth drives, and on the shore
Of purpose fixed no one of us is free.”
The sad wraith faded, and the moon again
Caught bit and stirrup as the groom bent over,
With angry spurs and tight-gripped bridle-rein,
Above the foaming horse unto his lover.
No word returned upon the words he said,
No answer to his arms that held her fast;
But dead leaves crackled in dry boughs o’erhead,
And on the wind a wandering echo passed.

Mr. J. Williams, of Northern Sta-
tion, N. E. Port Augusta, sends his
photo and writes that he has been a
sufferer from impure blood and indi-
gestion, with pimples on his face, and
blackheads. He was always taking
medicines of some kind, with no re-
lief until he began with Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla and Ayer’s Pills. He took
in all three bottles of the Sarsaparilla
"and two bottles of the Pills, with the
result that the pimples and black-
heads disappeared and he was relieved
entirely of his indigestion.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
acts directly upon the blood-forming glands of the body, stimulating them td
produce healthy, rich, red blood ; the kind of blood that brings a good whole-
some color to the lips and cheeks, clearing away pimples and blackheads.
As now made, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla contains no alcohol. Be
sure that you get “AYER’S," not some worthless imitation.

“ PROCRASTINATION IS THE
THIEF OF TIME,”
May be a copybook maxim, but it is as true
to-day as in the days of our youth.
The best cure, if'you intend to put up a
windmill, is to get one now, as the summer
will soon be here.
The first thing is to decide on the best
windmill.
it must have a bearing on each side of the
windwheel—to make it easy-running. It must
'be large and have a large sail area—to make it
powerful. It must be strong—to resist the
storm.
The “Steel Wings” Windmill
meets these requirements exactly.
