THE RT OF PHIL MAY
“ I'\KA)V firm ! and be jolly ! ” said W. M.
| 1 Hunt to a'class. His beatitudes were
-J J' May’s aptitudes. Decisive pen-line,
sunny temperament : May owed them
to inherited nervous organisation. The essentials
of his career were assured before he was born.
Yet of his parentage we know scarcely anything.
For one who talked so freely, May was singularly
reticent about himself. That the household was
straitened, that the father died early, that the boy
was thrown on the streets for a livelihood ; we have
heard little more than this. Of his mother, May
seems never to have spoken. Yet her influence
must have been great, possibly in the end para-
mount.
Gifted by birth, May was doubly gifted by
circumstance. “What was the chief factor of
your success ? ” J. E. Eraser asked an American
millionaire. “My poverty.” Poverty, mother
of heroes ! May became a fine draughtsman
simply because he had to. It was “Draw, Phil,
or die !”, In those early days at Leeds, and later
in London, May lived by his. art, not for it.
Often his dinner must have depended upon his
talent for catching a likeness. He was in the
position of a dog that is compelled to beg for a
biscuit. May got the biscuit, and later found that
he had trained nerve and muscle rarely.
Hunger sharpened his eye for form. Hunger
Eerfected the co-ordination of brain and
and. One may ponder what May would have
become had his natural capacity been fostered in
a comfortable home, through the routine of the
art schools. Ponder—and conclude that, though
his work might have covered a broader field, it
could never have risen to the height it holds in
his own particular field. His temperament would
have undone him. He had to be spurred to draw :
he needed no spur to jollity. “If I had a son,’’
he said, “ I would not like him to go through the
struggle that I have had.” But it was to that
struggle he owed his success; he was forced to
succeed, half despite himself. His bitter boyhood
achieved him.
It is not necessary to believe all that May told
interviewers about his methods and his work.
Remember that he had posed before the foot-
lights, was acquainted with all the shifts and
devices of the stage. Hardship had made him
shrewd : he knew the value of a mask in public.
Often he worked laboriously, studied life care-
fully. Often, toward the end, he trusted memory
and photographs, and with his own skill and an
actor’s passed tinsel for profound.
The “leaving-out method” was doubtless based
on a genuine principle, deliberately adopted. In
Gutter-Snipes this method is manifested admirably.
But once the public had been taught to believe
that the fewer the lines, the greater the talent,
one suspects that May, with tongue in cheek,
would minimise his labour to little more than
those few lines. Some of the drawings in the
Annual warrant the suspicion. When- he worked
in a hurry (and he was in a hurry often) May was
not too scrupulous.
May looked old when he was young, and he •
remained young when he was old. He was boy
for ever, in spite of wrinkles, in spite of experi-
ence and fame. In Sydney, in London, his heart
and brain changed little from the heart and brain
of the youngster in Leeds. The pictures he saw
most clearly and set down most effectively were
the pictures that recalled his childish days—pic-
tures of street character, street children. His art
was a tool to express anything ; but his brain lived
and died with eager, cheerful, irresponsible
urchins in a city slum.
May wished to go on the stage. He wished to
be a painter. Capacity "to paint, to act, he had
possibly; but the time to train his capacity had
gone by. The technic of pen-drawing he had
mastered almost to perfection : for the technic of
acting, of painting, he needed a new youth, new
energies, a fresh apprenticeship to Necessity.
With another bent, May might have become a
great painter. But his bent had been taken
decisively: he remains a brilliant draughtsman,
an illustrator with unsurpassed talent for depict-
ing certain people in certain scenes.
d*
May’s art was essentially athletic. Herkomer
meant this when he said that May’s line was like
the stroke of Joachim’s bow. A good drawing by
May is a tour de force. What his eye clearly saw,
his hand accurately expressed, in so far as a black-
on-white line can express objects. The mechanics
of the feat, the correspondence between aim and
realisation, are so absolute that we receive a
pleasure akin with that given by a wonderful
stroke at billiards, or a clean somersault in the
circus. There is in May’s drawings an intellectual
beauty of precision and harmony that is the basis
of their artistic merit. Many inferior draughts-
men have become memorable artists. But May,
lacking his draughtsmanship, would have counted
for little. We prize him chiefly because he could
give to a single line individual power, par-
ticular charm.
In this quality of athletic skill, May never sur-
passed some of the drawings contributed to The
Bulletin. His eye, his hand, and his brain in
so far as it controlled eye and hand, were
never better adjusted than when he lived in
Australia. Here he exhibited all his wonderful dex-
terity at its height. Later he gained in suavity
and humanity at some expense of brilliancy. Gain
and loss were the natural consequence of age: as
May’s brain grew fuller in understanding, its
means of expression grew less sure. Possibly
gain and loss were to some extent deliberate;
for all art is a compromise. The poet resigns the
just word for the sake of a poem; the artist
resigns the just line for the sake of a picture.
The absolute expression of such a skill as May’s
seems always a little hard, a little cold. One
gains softness and emotion by conceding.
To a certain extent May’s vision was superficial,
his range limited. His art is neither very broad
nor very deep. Artist he was, yet his athletic
faculty was not enforced by the highest artistic
consciousness. Loosely to phrase it, if eye
and hand were an artist’s, the brain was a
gamin’s. Life gave May a series of little emotional
fillips. These he transfers to his page with a bare
suggestion of the character behind the image, the
meaning beneath the scene. He never generalised;
it is an accident if some of his figures are types.
It was less humanity than the appearances of
humanity that he portrayed. One could almost
say that his impression of objects went no deeper
than his eye. But his hand was miraculous.
d*
He drew firm ; he was jolly.
RECENT READING
Our N.S.W. Birth-rate Commission (some of
the members have no answer to “Physician, heal
thyself ! ”) can read Margaret Bisland’s article,
“ The Curse of Eve,” in July North Amer. Review.
The lady discusses the decline of the U.S.A.
birth-rate—
This failure in natural and wholesome increase among
our white natives is due to nothing more or less than the
over-education and abnormal public activities so ardently
encouraged among our women since the close of the
Civil War. We take too slight an account of this when
we wonder uneasily at our inability to plant an individual,
self-sustaining, indigenous people in the United States.
We forget, or refuse to realise, what is inevitably to
follow as the result of a false equality permitted between
the sexes ; and we have not rightly interpreted or sus-
tained that masculine instinct, old as the race itself,
which regards as an unmixed evil any emancipation of
the woman that excites her to effort and attainment
beyond the bounds of domesticity.
The denial to woman of an equal share in man’s intel-
lectual and physical career is not, as the near-sighted
advocates of feminine enfranchisement would have us
believe, a useless relic of barbarism and savagery. It is
not an indication of mere male covetousness, selfishness,
and blind prejudice, upheld and exercised through ages
by force of sheer physical superiority, and serving now
as a stumbling-block in the path of beneficent progress.
True enough, perhaps, it is a tradition inherited from
our barbaric and Asiatic ancestors ; nevertheless, it flows'
from an ancient and profound realisation of and respect
for an inexorable law of nature—a law that never fails to
deprive intellectually developed woman of her fecundity.
It flows also from a knowledge, gained through the
tragedy of experience, that only in the domestic shelter
does civilised humanity find the environment congenial
to reproductivity and proper development.
Margaret adds: “ WithouHier motherhood woman
has nothing of importance to contribute to the
work of human elevation. Indeed, after a certain
point, the non-domestic and childless woman is a
menace to social purity and to national stability.”
That is so. Only by fecuridity woman becomes
useful to the race. That she may be racially use-
ful, she must be secluded in a harem or its modern
equivalent of the home, and kept off the grass
of cerebral excitement.

M. B. Synge tells ‘ ‘ the story of the world for
the children of the British empire.” Sis books
are conceived as a series of dramatic passages
taken from the legend of tradition and of history,
simply and effectively related. The three volumes
issued — On the Shores of the Great Sea ; The Dis-
covery of New Worlds ) The Awakening of Europe
—rank well upon the list of available school-,
books. Asa universal history for children their
scope is limited, their method conventional.
World-history to-day should not begin with,
Hebrew myths, given disproportionate importanoe
And, without insisting on the doubtful point
whether a history for children should contain
ethical valuations of deeds and epochs in relation
to human progress, one thinks that M. B. Synge
should have devoted less space to war and more
to social conditions. The type of sis volumes is
good, but the illustrations are scanty. History
for children should be pictured on every page.

The King business is like a poker game. It’s
been goin’ on f’r a long time, an’ whiniver it puts its
money in we lay down, thinkin’ we was up again’ a hand-
ful iv kings an’ queens. But th’ minyit they’se a show-
down th’bluff is over. Thin we see that th’hand that
we were afraid iv is composed intirely iv sivins, sixes an’
dooces, with maybe wan jack that looks like a king on’y
to near-sighted people. A show-down is death to rilety.
Whin I was a boy, if a king fell out with his folks, no
wan knew iv it but th’ earls an’ markesses an’ jooks that
overheerd th’ row while they were waitin’on th’table.
They didn’t say anything, but wrote it down in a note-
book an’ published it afther they was dead. Whin th
king passed th’ butther plate so high to his wife that it
caught her in th’ eye, it was a rile secret. When his rile
spouse pulled his majesty around th’ room be th’ hair iv
th’ head, th’ tale remained in th’ fam’ly till it got into
history. Whin wan iv th’ princesses threatened to skip
with a jook, th’ king touched th’ spring iv th’ thrapdure,
an’ her rile highness, Augoostina Climintina Sofia Maria
Mary Ann, wint down among th’ coals an’ th’ potatoes
an’ niver was heard iv again.
But nowadays ’tis diff’rent. Th’ window shades is up
at th’ king’s house as well as ivrywhere else. Th’ gas is
lighted, an’ we see his majesty stormin’ around because
th’ dinner is late, kickin th’ rile dog, whalin’ th’ princes
iv th’ blood with a lath, brushin’ his crown befure goin’
out, shavin’ his chin, sneakin’ a dlirink at bed-time,
jawin’ his wife, an’ makin’ faces at his daughter.—F. P.

John Masefield, writing of “The Sea and
Sailors ” in Lond. Academy of 25th July, Says that “ The
only poet who has seen the sailor in the dingy intimacy
of his fo’c’s’le, and sung him in verse which is more
clarion than doggerel, is Mr. E. J. Brady, an Australian,
whose book of poems, The Ways of Many Waters, was
published in Sydney a few years ago. Mr. Brady writes
in ballad-metres, much as Adam Gordon wrote, and
Kingsley and Macaulay before him. He writes movingly
and convincingly without putting an undue accent upon
that ‘ plea for escape,’ or submission to a certain idea,
which mars most modern English ballads, and without
subordinating his talent to realistic effect. He has a
certain manly frankness about certain masculine short-
comings, which one admires, because man is a frank
creature naturally and not a whit the nicer for being
hypocritical in print. He knows the vagabond and the
steward, and the stevedore, and that pitiful hero the
sailorman. He knows them perfectly. . . . But
the curious thing is that he knows the blue-jacket
quite as well as his poor relation, and ‘The Passing of
Parker,’ a long ballad of the death of a blue-jacket in a
China Squadron battleship, is perhaps the best narratival
ballad in dialect that we have. We like Mr. Brady less as
a serious poet, because his assertion in that metier is
mere violent rhetoric, and comes from a very windy tra-
dition. Though he can be suggestive and moving in some
of the images he uses, as in—
The penguin, standing lonely
’Neath weird, snow-darkened skies—
which conjures up a vision of the no-man’s-land some-
where south of the Magellan Straits.”

A group of miners were discussing the well-
known Dutch law relating to royalty, which sets forth
that any queen who takes to herself a consort, as the
present Queen Wilhelmina has done, must bear a baby
before the expiration of five years, failing which she
must divorce her husband. One of the party here inter-
rupted. “ That’s a bit rough on her Prince Consort,” he
argued. “ But look here,” said a practical-minded old
miner in the party, “ before I’d let a rich claim like that
be jumped I’d see about tribute ! ” —Kalgoorlie Sun.

At last one day our little child
Had strayed into the bush-track wild,

With a black friendly tracker tout.
We heard a nbcent waterspout
With a black friendly tracker tout

And where was Purtell’s victory.

All day we tracked her steps, we passed
O’er many a mile, until at last
We found her underneath a tree
With something red upon her knee.
The shining red her childish eye
Attracted till the tout came by :
’Tis thus a good deed shines, we know,
Within this naughty world of woe.

A flannel rag the child had found
Near where she, sat, and on the ground
A scarlet flannel shawl lay there
Upon a skeleton picked bare.
You see the point ? The grateful black
Had died to save her benefac-

Had hung her banner on her bones.

Who had it been, we could not tell.
But this I do remember well,
That when we parted with the black
A shawl like this was on her back.

But give us back oblivion’s grave!
MEMORANDA.
AUSTRALIAN BOOK-PLATES. —III.
Victor Daley draws our attention to the follow-
ing in The South Australian Register of Aug. 25
THE RED CONQUEROR.
POET’S END IN THE SOUTH SEAS.
A REMARKABLE' SCENE.
BANQUET, MARRIAGE, AND DEATH.
Victor James Daley, poet, of Sydney, once of Ade-
laide for a brief time, recently went to the Solomon
Islands in search of health. He died there, at the age
of 45, in most remarkable circumstances, which are
graphically told in the Bed Page of The Bulletin, by
James Harrison, who is believed to be established as
a trader on the island of Choiseul. His story, says
the editor, is substantially as follows :
Then follows Janies Harrison’s account of certain
occurrences on the island of Ohoiseul, here given on
Aug. 20. We do not know what ground The Register has
for connecting Harrison’s account with Mr. Daley, unless
it be that Mr. Daley was in the neighbourhood at about
the same time. However, Mr. Daley has called appa-
rently in propria persona, and protests that he is still
alive, and that The Register has taken a most unwarrant-
able liberty when it declares him dead. We are bound
to say that Mr. Daley looks alive, and in excellent
health. However, The Register is a most reputable
paper, with a most respectable tradition, and one cannot
conceive what motive it can have for perverting fact. On
the other hand, Mr. Daley is certainly a prejudiced wit-
ness in his own cause. It is clear that, if he really were
dead, as The Register affirms, he could not be expected to
admit it. The whole matter is shrouded in mystery.
What has The Register got to say about it ?
“ I look forward, with a thrill,” says Max Beer-
bohm in The Saturday Review, “ to the time when Aus-
el i .Maoriland, Canada and other darling colonies
shall be steadily exporting to the Mother Country all the
drama she needs to supplement her own limited produce.
. . Our kitlx and kin, so martial, so commercial, so alto-
gether remarkable and delightful, are yet undistinguished
in the arts. So much the worse for the arts. I picture
them, these poor arts, pouting, languishing, smiling,
beckoning, running the whole gamut of wistful coquetry,
while our kith and kin, with their clear colonial eyes and
their firm colonial mouths, stare stolidly back, not
seducible.”
A little bird sat on a telegraph wire,
And said to his mates, “ I declare,
If wireless telegraphy comes into tfgue.
We’ll all have to sit on the air."
— Bond. Fishing Gazette.
Richard de Bury, the quaint fourteenth-century
bookfellow wh*se Philobiblion has been re-issued recently
at 2s. 6<L, notes that “ the Saviour also has warned us by
His example against an unbecoming carelessness in the
handling of books, as we read in St. Luke. For when
He had read the Scriptural prophecy of Himself in the
book that was delivered to Him, he did not give it again
to the minister until He had closed it with His own most
sacred bands. By which students are most clearly taught
that in the case of books the merest trifles ought, not to
be neglected.” “Jesus as a Bibliophile!” would look
well on the Sunday notice-board of one of our notoriety-
hunting parsons.
The single-volume edition of The Encyclopedia
Biblica should be bought by every minister of religion in
Australasia. It costs £4, and is worth it.

Chambers (Lond., Griffiths; Well., Gordon & Gotch,
12m0., 32 pp., pa.; Is. net.) [The author seems doubt-
ful of his category : he prints The New Chum am

no doubt whatever.]

draws very well for an amateur, and he writes yerj
badly for a professional. His poetry is fine. It reminds
one of Slade n’s.]

BOOK, ILLUSTRATED, and
full of information showing
you what Electricity will do
for you, and also the cures
effected. It is sent EREE
to anyone who will only
write for it. We send it
closely sealed and postage
paid. We would also be
pleased for anyone to call
and have a FREE DIAGNOSIS of their ailment made, or have the working of this
wonderful appliance explained to them.
VISIT THIS
If you are suffering from any of the above complaints, and you have
that Doctors, Drugs and other so-called remedies have given you no relier
from your ailment, we ask you to call or send and see wbat Eleetraca
do for you. We know we can cure you, no matter an what state ©.
you may be in, with this Wonderful Belt of ours, for by its use cases of 10
years standing have been cured.
DR. MCLAUGHLIN’S ELECTRIC BELT
every other remedy has failed. The fact is, medicines cannot cure these complaints, as you will know if you have tried them. 1 dectncity
every other r y w jjj c j, j g nerve force—is the power that has been drained from the system,
and to cure it must be replaced. This Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt
will do. It is the crowning triumph in electrical science, and is
within the reach of All Classes.
Are you a weak man 1 Are you, nervous, fretful and
gloomy 1 Is your sleep broken 1 Have you pains and
aches in different parts of your body 1 Is your back weak
and painful? Do you feel that you are breaking up 1 Are
you Rheumatic and Gouty ? Have you Varicocele 1 These
are all the result of a waste of vital force. The gentle
stream of electricity from DR. McLAIJGHLIN’S ELEC-
TRIC BELT going into the weak
nerves for hours every night soon
replaces all the lost energy and
makes every nerve and muscle
perfect. It cures permanently in
every case.
Do not buy an Electric Belt until you have
absolutely decided to take no more Drugs®
There can be no doubt as to the value of this great curative agent,
when we have thousands of undoubted letters of gratitude.
Mr. T. TJ. Treleavan, Gawler Hail, South Australia, writesl
am pleased to say that after wearing your Electric Belt for a month according to
directions it has benefited me very much in my back and stomach, and I feel quite a
different man ; it seems as if my strength has been renewed and youth restored
again. From being a sceptic lam now your most ardent supporter.
Mr Ewen Chisholm, of 50 Little Park-street, South Melbourne (Vic.), testifies:— “ After using your
Belt for three months lam glad to say that I have derived great benefit from it. It has removed pains of many years stan -
ingf wldchlnever expedted to get ri/of. Previous to usin| your Belt I have been at
in back and limbs. I may say that I have not used any medicine since I received your Belt, and I also say that i feel tar
healthier and stronger than I have done for many years past.
Mr. S. Hawkins, of Singleton (N.S.W.), writing for his ton says:— “ Gentlemen,—My son Chas. wishes
me to state that he is now in perfect health. He can eat and sleep well, and has already gained 71bs in weight and has not
that wearied feeling in the morning, but can do any kind of work, and is very thankful for what it has been the means of doing
for him, and will recommend it whenever he has the opportunity.

front and peep rear sights. 48 It shoots .22 Short and .22 Long

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Shadow Song 1 .
The words of an olden rhyme
Ring in my brain ;
Dim ghosts of a golden time
That never again
Shall we, in the years to be,
Live ever more.
The sweetness of that faint strain !
As the scent of a rose in rain,
Or wind from a perfumed shore.
The merging of sky and cloud
In sombre grey,
Far rain and mist, like a shroud
Hanging over the bay,
Call back the long-forgotten
With a rush of tears;
The passing of one sweet day,
As a dream that has fled away
And is folded in the years.
How a breath of southern wind,
Or wattle-scent,
Can waken the years behind
That are redolent
Of roses in garder s dim,
And a star or two
In the purple firmament,
And a crescent moon that is bent
To gather a glimpse of you !
The words of the song are old,
The tune is slow;
They unroll, fold by fold,
All the Long Ago ;
In the East o’er the sea
Breaks the dawning light,
And the rose of its glow,
On the sky-rim low,
Shines from the grave of night.
Q.
ELFIE V. KELLEHER.
Keepsakes.
This world of ours, all garmented in green,
The Preachers say is but a passing scene.
The things we know and love are none of ours,
But lent us for a time alone. The flowers,
The waving woods, and many-laughing sea,
Are keepsakes for the Race that is to be.
And yet I know a meadow whence the Lark
Rises, and sings. at dawn above the dark.
I know a tree that in the early spring
Blooms into rose-winged birds that soar and sing
I know the still sea in the morning wan,
Like a bright steel sword softly breathed upon.
I know the secret of the World’s Desire
That hides within the red heart of the fire.
I have some friends —none better man could own—
And must I leave them, and go forth alone ?
I saw a statue in the white moonshine —
The crowned white Mother and the Child divine;
The Mother and the Child, with calm command,
Benignly gazed upon the sleeping land.
The Preacher says this world so gay and green,
So full of glamor, is a passing scene.
I wish that, when Death closes my dim eyes,
These keepsakes I may take to Paradise.
N.B.W.
VICTOR J. DALEY.
In the Doldrums.
This is better than the fretting
Through the streaming, gleaming froth }
Just to dream and lie fc rgetting—
It is better for us both.
Though we tingled to the welter
Of the shredded seas, our shelter
Was to meet the storm full-lipped,
Dreaming, through the gale of passion
In a happy, heartless fashion,
Of the anchor that we slipped.
Keen the kisses through the drumming
Of the thunder of the seas ;
Oh, the lyrics we were strumming
On your banjo of heart’s ease !
Oh, your lips were hot, a-flying
Through the dark when you were lying
Jn my arms, dear, in the bows.
Now the days are slow a-going,
And a softer breeze is blowing
Very scornful on our brows.
Through the screaming dark, and hissing,
Swishing spindrift on the spars,
We were kissing, kissing, kissing,
Steering not by any stars,
With your soft lips parted, pouting
For the sting of waves that, shouting,
Whirled behind us, torn and tossed.
On the road to Hell together !
With no time or tears or tether,
And the world forlorn and lost.
But our sleep came through our straining,
And I waked from dreaming deep
To the sound of tears a-raining
For the storm we lost asleep.
And the red dawn crept from cover,
And our stormy run was over,
And our cold lips sighed apart.
Oh, the idle breezes mocking
Our stripped vessel left a-rocking
In the doldrums of the heart!
It was life, love, while it lasted,
On our wild half-ended path ;
It was wine, red wine, we tasted
In the marriage of our breath
But this quiet, dear, is better ;
Dreams are free of fear or fetter,
Full of ever-shining fire ;
So we ll end the road in dreaming.
And in ghost-ships go a-steaming
To Our island of desire.

Nervous Weakness and Exhaustion.
A Great Change for the Better.
The Case of*
Mrs C. SHEWANJ
(Bit OCR REPORTER.)
Mrs. Elizabeth Shewan, of No. 8 Little
Eduard-streeb, Pyrmonb, was recently in-
terviewed by a press representative, and
gave her views on various matters of in-
terest.
“I am given to understand that you
created a great surprise amongst your
neighbours a little while back,” said the
newspaper man. “ Will you kindly tell me
what it was all about ? ”
“ With the utmost pleasure,” was the
hearty reply. “It was by shaking off a
long-standing complaint that I surprised
everybody, myself included, for I had been
suffering for many years from dyspepsia.
The reason why my recovery was unex-
pected was because I had been under the
care of several doctors, taking their medi-
cines till I positively loathed the sight of it,
besides being treated as an out-door patient
at a hospital for five months, and no good
came from all the physics which had been
administered to me. What else could I
think than that I was incurable ? And to
be in such a hopeless predicament was really
awful. Earth and heaven were both blotted
out of my existence, as the inefficacy of the
medical treatment I had received left me
alone in the world with nothing but physi-
cal suffering to endure. For years there
was scarcely a day passed but that I felt
intensely tired and so weary and weak that
I had to let my work go undone because I
was unable to do it, and often I could hardly
get about for the terrible pains in my chest
and between my shoulders. It seemed as if
something heavy was preventing me from
getting my breath, and if the weather was
at all warm the smothering sensations were
frightfully distressing. The whole of my
system was out of order, the consequence
being that I was hardly ever without a de-
pressing headache, and a feeling as if my
eyes were swollen also troubled me. When-
ever I made an effort to do a little work the
exertion made me feel lightheaded, and at
times I was afraid to go outside the door on
account of giddiness, which used to seize me
and make me powerless to stand on my feet.
Another reason why I deemed it prudent to
keep as still as possible was that any exer-
tion gave me palpitation of the heart. It
might be through getting up from a chair
rather too quickly, or, perhaps, through a
little agitation caused by sounds in the
street that the palpitations came on ; but in
every instance I felt greatly distressed, to
say nothing of the fears about what might
be wrong with me which entered my mind.
So many people in this country die from
various affections of the heart that anything
wrong with that organ is naturally alarm-
ing, but I now know that it was my liver
which causes those serious symptoms to
appear.”
“ Were there any other liver symptoms in
evidence 1 n
“ Well, the gall-like taste in my mouth
and the furred condition of my tongue
pointed to the fact that my internal organs
required renovating, while to digest my food
was an utter impossibility. Try what I
would in the form of light diet, it was all
the same, after eating being violent spasms
of wind in the stomach which almost drove
me frantic, and often I felt inclined to roll
on the floor in the excess of agony, which
was making my life insupportable*- The
food I had eaten was not taken from choice,
because I had no appetite for it, and it was
this continuous loss of appetite which
grieved me, as I knew that I could never get
strong so long as I was unable to take
nourishment to give me strength. And as
my vitality wasted away, so did my loins
and limbs ache. I felt as sore as if I had
been beaten from head to foot, and no won-
der that my bones were racked with aches,
for my body and brain seldom got any rest.
Sleepless nights I passed in profusion, al-
though if I slept at all I dreamed in such a
terrifying manner that wakefulness would
have been far preferable. What a nervous
wreck I became, to be sure ! My nerves
were so weak and highly strung that if any-
body knocked at the door I nearly jumped
out of my chair, and then it took them a
long time to get steady again. A dread, of
something happening tormented my mind
both day and night, but did I not have good
reason to be like that, considering that my
disease stood defiantly against my medi-
cines ? ”
“As you are so well now, Mrs. Shewan,
that statement is scarcely correct.”
“ I mean up to the time of taking
Clements Tonic; then everything changed
for the better. I made a great mistake in
not heeding the advice of many of my friends
who had repeatedly urged me to take
Clements Tonic ; but I thought if doctors
could not cure me, nothing could. When at
last I became persuaded, Clements Tonic
soon showed what a mistaken notion this
was, for after taking two or three bottles I,
felt quite different, my improved appearance
being the subject of general comment
amongst my neighbours. The appetite 1
gained through the medium of Clements
Tonic was, to say the least of it, remark-
able. I was always ready for my meals,
and how could I enjoy them ? That dull
and heavy feeling after eating passed away,
and when my food ceased turning to wind
and creating pain, I could soon go about in
comfort and do a little work, for I always
woke up feeling fresh and vigorous after the
sound sleep which came thlough using
Clements Tonic. In time my chest and
head pains disappeared, and nothing gave
me greater satisfaction than the banishment
of my heart troubles. I could walk about
quite briskly without there being any pal-
pitation or dizziness, the only inconvenience
which I experienced after three weeks’ use
of Clements Tonic being from nervousness,
for I still trembled a little if I had been ex-
erting myself very much ; but in a few days
later that trouble was entirely remedied,
and it has never come back again. My
digestive system wa3 thoroughly restored to
order, and from that day to this I must say
that the weary aches in my limbs have been
strangers. The acute pains in my head and
shoulders were also carried away by
Clements Tonic, which regulated my in-
ternal organs to a nicety. Such a catalogue
of human suffering as mine was could not
have been more severe, yet Clements Tonic
relieved me of every pain, besides pouring
into my system the invigorating and disease-
curing qualities it possessed, so that I was
left with the full vigour and health of my
younger days. The return of that alacrity
and cheerfulness of spirits that I was wont
to have made my recovery complete, and I
am not likely to forget that it is to Clements
Tonic that my gratitude is owing.”
“Will you make that admission through
the press ? ”
“ Willingly, for I recognise the fact that
many people are suffering in despair like I
was, and for their benefit you may publish
my testimony in any way you choose.”

Redemption by Flag-flapping 1 .
A correspondent, with the best of intentions in
the world—one of the class which goes into politics
occasionally and becomes an Owe’Sullivan—
sends to The Bulletin an item on American
patriotism from an English paper, with the
suggestion that a “rousing article advocating
something in the same line here would do immense
good.” The extract is this:
Patriotism in America is a school subject. Even in
New York the boys and girls at the public schools are
marched off to their class-rooms every morning to the
sound of the national anthem, and then made to take a
daily vow of loyalty. Over the teacher’s desk is hung
the Stars and Stripes, and the pupils, holding out their
right hands towards it, repeat: “ I pledge my allegiance
to the flag and the country for which it stands—one
country, indivisible, with justice and liberty for all.'’
But they have gone one better even than this in Kansas.
There they take the national anthem, split it up into
sections, and make each section the basis of an “ oration ”
at the annual “ commencement exercises.” For instance,
the head pupil is allotted ‘ *My Country, ’Tis of Thee,”
and proceeds to “orate” on material America; the
second pupil holds forth on the growth of civil liberty
under the title of “ Sweet Land of Liberty ” ; the third
starts from the words, “ Of Thee i Sing,” and discusses
American poetry ; and so on through the entire hymn.
* * * *
The correspondent, with his pathetic mental
failing which makes it impossible for him to dis-
tinguish between blather and patriotic feeling, is
typical of a large class in Australia. This huge
continent, after shaking off the chains of convict-
ism and securing representative institutions,
began almost at once to fall back in national
spirit. For this there were very easily recognised
economic reasons, and there are very easily ascer-
tained economic and political remedies. But the
way to reform is hindered by the number of foolish,
well-meaning people, who see the hope for the
future in teaching school-children to yell in front
of a flag, or in persuading adults in the pupil
stage of mental development to join associations
for being very proud of being Australians. There
are certain manifestations of national feeling, in
themselves of no intrinsic worth, in many cases
somewhat ridiculous when looked at in the dry
light of reason, which are natural and excusable in
times of exultation. To celebrate by holiday the
anniversary of a great national achievement, to
get intoxicated about a flag which has led to a
great national victory, or about one which
has made a good show in the face of over-
whelming defeat, to indulge in a little “blow”
and exuberance after the heat and burden
of nation-making has ended in achieved greatness,
is natural enough—not at all essential certainly,
and to be tolerated rather than encouraged, still
not exactly ■blameworthy. But the idea seems to
be more than ordinarily prevalent in this country
that Australia is to become a great nation by
having its holiday and its whoop and its disor-
dered eloquence and its flag-worship and its
exhibition of diseased vanity without having done
any of the work. It is to become a great nation
simply by resolving that it’s a jolly good fellow
and that if anyone should tread on its tail the
consequences will be dreadful. And that’s not
the way to greatness. It’s a kind of glorying in
die mullock-heap without having won anygold—as
•■hough themud were the purpose, instead of being a
rather unpleasant by-product of the work. It is
•■rue that very rarely does a patriotic movement
progress without the accompaniment of some
turgid bluster. But the bluster isn’t the move-
ment. Many Australians make the mistake of
thinking it is.
* * * *
Flag-waving, demonstrating, processing, join-
ing mumbo-jumbo lodges and associations, becom-
ing addicted to regalia and countersigns, bleating
of children and blathering of meii, hinder, and do
not help, a national movement. They put things
in a false light of sickly sentimentalism, sap
national vitality and detract from that manly
sturdiness which is the root of all genuine
patriotism. . A people truly great is ever austere
inspirit, “ sitting in calmness and light, positive
and composed”—not in any sense dour and sombre,
gay when the occasion fits, but never vain-glorious
and sentimental. It is a sign of decadence in
the American national character that it has of late
given itself up so much to oratory and flag-waving,
and Jingoism and frenzied wars with little people
—all of which are, in a sense, expressions of the
one mental attitude. Boastfulness breeds arro-
gance, and arrogance the desire for easy mastery,
and thence cruelty, and finally cowardice. It is
at the stage when the course begins to be down
hill that a nation’s titles become most grandilo-
quent and aspiring. Every people begins to
assume adjectives as it loses attributes of real
strength, and, when its fighting arm becomes
palsied, enters upon its last campaigns of spolia-
tion against the dictionary. In so much as
American public men now encourage flag-worship
and spread-eagle oratory, by so much do
they show the weakening of their fibre
and their progress towards decay. Australia,
already much inclined that way through the evil
teachings of politicians and press-writers, should
most emphatically not be encouraged by any true
nationalists to deliberately foster a puling patriot-
ism of ribbons and rhetoric The great want in
this land is not for men, women, or children to
wave something, sing something, or orate some-
thing, but to do something—to beget children, to
establish industries, to till the fields, to pay up
the debt.
* • • •
The last might almost be put first. No country
can have any self-respect which is in pawn to
foreign money-lenders, and which must always be
considering how its actions or words will “affect
its credit.” The man who is hopelessly in debt
to a virulent Catholic can’t afford to be much of a
Protestant; the man whose furniture is liable to
be sold up by an Orangeman can’t be openly
much of a Catholic ; the man who is hopelessly in
pawn to a Jingo learns to swallow his republican
views for fear of offending his creditor and not
getting the bill renewed. No man so placed can
have a soul of his own or any decent feeling of
manliness. Nor can a nation. Australia is
nowadays asked daily to tremble because some-
body’s speech or action may affect the country’s
credit abroad. So to ask Australian children to
sing
Australia’s marching on to a future bright and grand
when, as a matter of fact, she is slinking along
beneath the eye of Uncle is bad as a lie and worse
as a folly. The continent should not have any-
thing approaching a flattering remark to say about
itself until it has at least started to redeem its
pledged property and to get some of its tools of
government out of Uncle’s claws. Nor should
there be any unnecessary waving of the Austra-
lian flag until it can wave over something like a
self-contained, self-supporting country. Aus-
tralia at present imports governors, gimcracks,
military commanders, machinery of all sorts,
officials, turkeys, cheese, clergymen, lollies, law-
yers, and a host of other articles easily capable of
local production. It exports mainly immature
promissory notes and raw products. Its lot is
that of the Gibeonites, to do the rough, coarse
work of other people, leaving higher work for
supposedly higher intelligences. Until that posi-
tion is altered, and Australia shows ability to
produce guns and governors, and ships and
engines—shows that it is as good a country as
Chili or Belgium, there is no call for vainglorious-
ness. This continent really does not own a flag
or an anthem to get excited over, not having to
its credit the achievements of which they are the
symbols. So there is no good in teaching young-
sters to bellow undeserved metrical compliments
or salute a pawned banner. We should earn our
songs first and sing them afterwards; redeem our
country before glorifying its greatness. It is one
of the most discouraging features of Australian
public life that, when so much evil awaits remedy,
and so much good work is undone, the commonly
proposed method of reform is to sing sometliing,
or wear a badge, or make a speech. That is aim-
ing at the flush of hysteria instead of the glow of
health.
Our Decaying’ Natural Industries.
The daily papers and the average platform orator
supply the loose language and the poetry about
the great natural producing industries of New
South Wales; Coghlan’s just-issued “Statistical
Register,” part X., dealing with agriculture,
supplies some facts by which the loose language
and the poetry can be audited. If the loose
language and the facts don’t agree, then the loose
language, even though it rhymes beautifully, isn’t
of much account. The Foreign-trade paper tells
us that this isn’t a manufacturing country.
Nature, it says, has given us broad acres ; our
business is to look after them. So, we are told,
while our “ lusty manhood,” pursuing a healthy’
open-air life, supplies the world with raw
materials, the finished article should come to
us from the grimy factory of some older
and more thickly-peopled land, for that is
the obvious plan of Nature. There isn’t any
-evidence that any such plan really exists; but
Coghlan’s figures allow us to test, anyhow,
whether it would be good enough to meekly follow
it, if it did exist. The first fact of any conse-
quence that sticks out is that, whereas in 1882
(the first year for which the returns are furnished)
the average value of the crop which the man on
the land in N.S. Wales got was £7 4s. sd. per
acre, this year (1902-3) it averaged only £ll7s.
per acre. The total value of the State’s agricul-
tural produce in 1882 was £4,215,268; in 1902-3 it
was £4,153,831. The former was produced from
583,868 acres; the latter from 2,245,839 acres.
Thus it took very nearly four acres in 1903
to give a. return equal to what was given by
one acre in 1882. So, for 22 years of toil, 22
years of tremendous borrowing” to develop the
“inexhaustible natural resources of this great
country,” and for the labor and heart-break
of an ever-increasing army of toilers during the
best part of a generation, there is to show—just
this:

Thealmost continuous falling away in thereturns
is the most depressing feature. The area under
cultivation has increased fourfold ; the total value
of the crop has slightly diminished ; the return for
a given amount of labor has fallen to about one
quarter of what it used to be. So far as increasing
the return from agriculture is concerned, 22 years
of struggle have been wholly wasted. The man
on the land, engaged in what we are assured is the
great natural industry of the country, must either
work about four times as much land as he formerly
did in order to get the same return, or, if no more
land is available for him, he must starve on one-
fourth of his old income. Mostly, in order to
increase his area under cultivation, he has crowded
out someone else; the latter has either drifted
down to the city (\yhere, in the absence of indus-
tries, there is little for him to do unless he can
get a job at stone-breaking or at the Fitzroy
Dock), or he has drifted, further out West,
where there is plenty of land, of a kind, avail-
able. And the further he has drifted the further
his produce has had to be carted back for
want of an inland manufacturing population
to sell it to; and on that account, because
of his heavier expenses, the £4,153,831 of produce
which the State gathered last harvest was really
worth a great deal less to the producer than pro-
duce. of an equal value gathered 22 years ago.
Nor is this. larger bill for freight the only extra
burden which the man on the land has to bear
nowadays ; in order to get even as much as he is
now doing from the land, he has, with one-
quarter the income, to spend more money on
artificial fertilisers than was dreamed of only a
few years back. . The whole position, then, is
something like this : To get the same gross return
that he used to do, he has to work four times as
much land and provide four times as much seed ;
and out of his gross receipts he has to j ay many
expenses which were formerly unknown. From
1882 to 1889 (inclusive), the average return was
£5 os. Id. per acre per year ; from 1890 to 1895,
£4 4s. 3d.; 1895 to 1890, £2 16s. Id.; 1900 to 1903,
£2 Bs. 4d. And the new expenses have increased
in inverse ratio to the returns That, so far as
N.S. Wales is concerned, is the record of the
greatest of what are alleged to be the natural
producing industries of this country—the indus-
tries that we must look after, the Foreign-trade
paper says, to the exclusion of all else !
• * * *
As to the other States, the position would pro-
bably be found a good deal worse, because hardly
one of them is naturally so well-favored as N.S.
Wales. South Australia, for instance, which at
one time made a name for itself as a wheat pro-
ducer, cultivates absolutely less land now than it
did 20 years ago—it is giving up in many places
the weary struggle to make impoverished land pay
at the lower prices for grain which now rule. In
New South Wales the lowest average return for
all crops for any five-year period has been £2
Bs. 4d. ; while, from the wheat crops for which it
was once noted. South Australia has averaged but
13s. lid. per acre for the past 10 years, and even
that miserable yield has only been accom-
plished by a heavy outlay, amounting now
to over £100,030 a year, for artificial fertilisers
which did not figure at all in the expenses until a
few years ago. Altogether, then, the loose lan-
guage and the poetry furnished by the Foreign-
trade papers and orators don’t square at all with
the hard facts with which alone the statistician
has to deal; and if, as the former allege, Aus-
tralia can grow wheat and wool better than it can
do anything else, then, in view of these facts,
Heaven help Australia.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The East Sydney Election.
Last week there was some kind of an election in
Sydney. George Reid, who introduced to Aus-
tralia the evil he calls “gerrymandering”—
George Reid, who gerrymandered the N.S.W.
electorates, and killed the principle of one vote
one value, and rejected the scheme which his own
officers had devised for the re-adjustment of the
electorates on a population basis, and who held
the election of 1898 on the old electorates because
they suited him better—lately resigned his seat as
a protest against the Barton Government doing,
in a less virulent way, exactly what he did him-
self. It is a peculiarity of Reid’s unutterably foul
political character that every political sin he com-
plains of is the one he did himself, and the sin he
complains of most violently is generally the one
he first introduced to this country. An apparent
love of shame and exposure makes him do as pub-
licly as possible the things he denounces, and
denounce as publicly as possible the thing he did
yesterday and would do again to-morrow. Reid’s
complaint against the Federal Parliament is that,
under the old rolls which it proposes to use at the
coming Federal election, 200,000 electors in large
electorates will return seven members, while
100,000 in small electorates will do the same.
And George Reid’s own record at the 1898 elec-
tion was this:—
Electors. Electors.
Marrickville .. 3912 Inverell .. .. 1914
Grenfell ~ 3814 Tenterfield .. 1879
Darlington .. 3630 Ballina .. .. 1872
St. George’ .. 3559 Newcastle W. .. 1858
Balmain S, .. 3509 Richmond.. .. 1835
Paddington .. 3439 Uralla-Walcha .. 1832
Leichhardt .. 3410 Lismore .. .. 1663
25,263 12,853
So, as usual, the thing George Reid denounces is
exactly the thing he did himself. Even the
proportionate figures are the same. And whereas
the Federal Parliament, being dissatisfied with
the proposed arrangement, was practically driven
to fall back on the old rolls because there was
barely six months in which to re-adjust things,
George Reid had two years from the time when
he decided to ignore the recommendations of his
officers till the general election, so there is no
doubt that he gerrymandered from choice. And
he has, by his denunciations, added gross political
hypocrisy to his sin, which the Barton Govern-
ment hasn’t. And the Herald and Telegraph
and Evening News, which said gerrymandering
was quite a good thing, or at least an unimportant
thing, when, by saying so they helped to
keep an importers’ Ministry in office; and
denounced it as the unutterable sin, when by
doing so there was a chance of getting a
Ministry which encourages Australian industries
out of were lying and hypocrisy,
and dragged their alleged characters in the gutter
to which they naturally belong. It wasn’t worth
the Governments while to put up an opponent
against Reid, and it wisely left him alone in his
degradation. The election did not turn, in any
sense, on the gerrymandering question. East
Sydney is the stronghold of the German and other
foreign importers. It is a place which would
cheerfully reject an archangel if he was in favor of
encouraging Australian industries, and would
cheerfully elect a hangman if he was in favor of
repressing Australian manufactures for the benefit
of foreign industry. It has a representative
worthy of it, and it would be a pity if this beauti-
ful meeting of two kindred spirits should be inter-
rupted.
The Federal Ministry.
The fact that it is the Foreign-trade newspapers
which have revived the suggestion that Premier
Babton should become Chief Justice of Australia
provides in itself a considerable discount on the
probability of such a development. Still all
things are possible in politics ; and at the time
The Bulletin goes to press Barton may be
Chief Justice designate. It is an open secret
that some of his followers strongly desire this ;
they consider that it would be a fitting reward
for long services to the Commonwealth-—this
Eost which Barton’s abilities specially fit
im to fill. Further, they think that the
Federal cause will better progress with a
Premier of a less uncertain political mind. The
obstacles in the way of Premier Barton’s accept-
ance of the post are his optimism as to his
security of tenure as a political leader, the poor
financial provision that has been made for the
Chief Justice’s position, and the general desire
among Federalists that R. E. O’Connor —anothei
man thoroughly well equipped for it—should have
the only reward he would care to take for his ser-
vices to the Commonwealth. If Premier Barton
does retire from the Cabinet, the next Preir.ier
will be almost certainly Alfred Deakin. The
other competitor will be Lyne, and the other
“ possible ” Turner. Probably Turner will not
seek the position. Lyne’s chances are hopeless.
He was Federal Premier, technically, once, but
could not get a following, and it is not likely that
the men who would not serve under him in
1900 will have changed their minds in 1903.
An estimation of one’s own personal merit is
almost the only thing in politics not liable
to fluctuation. The Bulletin would, as a matter
of fact, prefer to see Lyne as Premier rather than
Deakin. The latter is another Barton, some-
what pliant, very affable and gentlemanly, fond of
middle courses, and likely to continue the Barton
tradition of being in all things politic. Lyne, as
Premier, would probably force Turner and
Deakin into opposition, and their union with
Kingston would give hope of a strong combination
for the next Cabinet. As it is now, Kingston is
being wooed seductively by George Reid, and the
*nightinareof a Kingston-Reidcoiii bination haunts
some minds. True, such an alliance is almost
impossible. Kingston would never sacrifice his
principles to Yes-No with Reid, and no conversion
of Reid’s mind could be accepted as genuine.
Still, The Bulletin, would like to see the men
it values by his side. The natural sequence
to Barton’s retirement would be Kingston’s
accession, the following of the man of the past by
the man of the present. But the political situation
just now forbids that. After the general election,
whatever the changes or the absence of changes
The Loafer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
We like to talk of heroes as we press our Sunday
chair,
We love to yarn of battles that would lift your
very hair ;
Our eyes they start a-flashing at our deeds of
derring-do,
And we tell our lies so often that we quite believe
them true;
But we like to take it easy
In the evening calm and breezy,
Let the Lascar sail our vessels o’er our ocean wide
and blue—
For the Lord who loves a loafer—He will see the
loafer through.
We like to tell the story how our fathers crossed
the brine,
How they battled thro’ the wilderness and forty
things malign ;
We point to much magnificence in stucco and in
stone,
And cry, “Behold the Grandeur that was lifted
from the Loan ! ”
And we never dream of Sorrow
With our Borrow, Borrow, Borrow !
We’ve a Hebrew for a pilot, anti we let him kick
the crew,
And we sing, “ The Lord who loves us—He will
see the loafer through ! ”
We’re a simple, happy nation—as we sit beside our
beer,
And we kiss the hand that fleeces us and call it
doubly dear;
We boast about our Freedom, and without a
touch of shame
We own ourselves too feeble to do battle for the
same ;
So it’s bring your Britisli seamen
To protect our languid freemen,
Let us tell the wond’ring peoples, “ We’ve as good
a chance as you,
For the Lord who loves a loafer—-He will see the
loafer through ! ”
True—the children who come after us will lift a
heavy load,
But they ’ll bear their dispensation as a bullock
bears the goad;
They ’ll be chastened for the welfare of their meek,
collective soul,
And they’ll find it reckoned Righteousness at
yonder gleaming goal.
So when troublous days importune
They must bear their evil fortune;
They must never blame their fathers if their beer’s
a bitter brew—
For the Lord who loves a loafer loves a loafer’s
children too.
And we’ve made a little anthem on our languid
little ways,
And we sing it, when we're lively, as a sort of
Marseillaise;
It’s a song of “ Leaning—Leaning,” in the blazing
summer glow;
It’s a song of “Leaning—Leaning,” when the
winter breezes blow;
It’s a kind of caterwauling,
Weary canticle of crawling,

before then, parties must almost inevitably sort
themselves out on new lines; the Foreign-trade
party will then have been convinced of the hope-
lessness of any movement towards a lower tariff,
and two sections will appear—Democrats and
Conservatives. The Democrats, if they have a
true sense of politics, will monopolise as their
platform the increase of Federal power, the in-
crease of the Federal tariff, the pursuance at home
of progressive industrial legislation, abroad of
Australian interests as paramount over all others.
That will leave Bruce Smith and the other Smith
and Joseph Cook and Malcolm M’Eacharn and
John Forrest and Macdonald Paterson to be-
come, quite naturally, a party of low tariffs, low
wages and low national ideals.

The Dominion of the Press.
It is more than probable that, if R. E. O’Connor
should decide to continue in the Barton Ministry
and stand for re-election to the Senate in Decem-
ber, he would be defeated. In fact, such an issue
is practically certain. Compared with all the
other N.S.W. Senators, O’Connor is an intel-
lectual giant. His services to the Commonwealth
have been great, and given ungrudgingly. Yet,
providing the Sydney Morning Herald and the
Sydney Telegraph mutually agreed to run Bill
Wilks or George Perry or Eden George—and
they are both quite capable of selecting any one of
these gentlemen as a Freetrade candidate —against
O’Connor, his chance of election would be practi-
cally hopeless. In the mass, the electors of N.S.W.
cannot be canvassed by any single man ; only the
daily newspapers can reach them. And in all
essential points the D.T. and the S.M.H. are
agreed. They may differ occasionally on some
matters, but it is only by inadvertence, and then
both are uneasy until the difference is obliterated.
Each one caters for the draper’s soul and the
auctioneer’s intellect, for it is on the drapers’ and
auctioneers’ advertisements that they exist; and
each one takes, with almost invariable consist-
ency, the draper’s view of politics. With the
powers of suppression and of booming which they
possess and use unsparingly, and with the miser-
able little evening papers almost always yelping
in chorus at their rear, the morning press of
Sydney has a power over the politics of the coun-
try which is as dangerous as it is degrading. At
Senate elections it is shown most conspicuously—
as when they cast into the Senate last election five
such representatives of the political rubbish of the
State as Messrs. Millen, Walker, Gould, Neild
and Pulseord. And—The Bulletin repeats—
almost any sample of York-street warehouse sweep-
ings whom the morning newspapers agreed to boom
would probably defeat O’Connor at the polls.
This is mentioned to impress again that there is
nothing more important to the Democratic and
National party in N.S.W. than some reform of
the press position. The cause of that party is
absolutely unrepresented in the Sydney daily
press and has but very poor representation in the
country. With the exception of the Barrier
Miner there is not, to writer’s knowledge, a country
paper of any great influence on the National side
of politics. A Sydney daily to take that side is,
of course, the prime requisite ; but something
useful might be done with the country press.
Every democratic politician ought to strive to help
to de-centralise press influence and to swing his
local country paper into the right path, which is
generally the other path to that trodden by the
Sydney dailies. The courageous attitude of
Premier See in N.S.W. has done a little to clip
the wings of the Sydney dailies. Concerted
action by the political leaders of democracy could
do more. It should be the first care of every
country district member to encourage as far as he
can the growth of an independent local paper.
If there were 50 daily papers of importance in
N.S.W. the task of keeping them unanimously
on the wrong side would be impossible. When
there are but two, and both controlled by the
same class in the same cit.v. it is easy,

Macedonia and Thereabouts.
The great row in Macedonia, which promises to
set Europe in a blaze before all is over, is only the
recrudescence of a trouble that has long made that
continent very tired. The Turk isn’t wholly
responsible for the trouble, though he is largely
responsible. Turkey and a great part of
Austria are inhabited, not so much by nations as
by debris. This is the Chinese puzzle section of
the continent. In very far back times, when
invading tribes poured, one after another, out of
Asia or nowhere, and struck against, first, the
Roman, and then the Greek empire, there were
wrecks thereabouts. The early tribes came too
soon, and pounded at the back-door of the
emperors of Constantinople when those gentlemen
were still too strong to have their doors
pounded with impunity. The invading nation
which couldn’t get further south because
the battered empire was still able to pre-
sent some kind of a front, which found the
Goths too strong in the North and the Franks in
the West, sank about the spot in question, and
became a snag and a danger to navigation.
There were many of them, and the result is that
Austria and Turkey include about 25 wrecked
nations, hardly any of which is really speaking
to any of the others. Then, in addition to the
remains of old bands of brigands who came down
to pick the bones of the Greek empire and perished
on the doorstep, there are the remains of the
empire itself, and of the peoples who were before
it —in fact, this country is the Sargasso Sea of
Europe —the centre of the great whirlpool, where
the water-logged and dismasted tribes accumulate.
The Turks cr - iuered Greece and its enemies im-
partially. A ,tria, with its German element for
a backbone, Keeps about 18 of these straggling
nations together in some kind of order and pros-
perity. In this respect, Austria is the blessing of
Europe; its action in keeping the peace among
all these wild cats saves its neighbors much
trouble. Turkey inherited the rest of the cats,
and made a mess of things—it never had the
Austrian staying power, and its menagerie broke
loose. The Roumanians have some sort of claim
on Turkey in Europe as alleged descendants of
the old Latin conquerors. The Greeks have a
claim as former owners. The Bulgarians have a
claim because they also owned most of the land
during their temporary glory in Simeon’s time.
The Servians claim it because it was mostly their
empire for a few years in the days of Stephen the
‘ ‘ Suffocater. ” The Macedonians have at least the
legendary claim that it was once a Macedonian
empire. The Albanians and Montenegrins play
each a lone hand and profess a cheerful readiness
to see all the other races darned first. The Italians
reckon one strip of the country should be theirs,
as part of the old Venetian republic. The Turks
are as regards a good part of the country, the men
in possession. The Russians want to be in posses-
sion so as to have a safe outlet from the Black Sea.
Austria wouldn’t mind having part of the coun-
try ; Austria is the only country which has made
much success at taming the wild cats of S.E.
Europe. The local races could wipe the floor
with the Turk if they were speaking to each
other and if old Obrenovitoh, the Pig-dealer,
could come back from his grave to lead them, but
there seems no hope of unity amons them.lt
some strong and reasonably humane State would
conquer the whole Peninsula, s k°?., the .
back into Asia, disarm all the inhabitants, fine
everybody 2s. 6d., wipe out the local boundaries,
build roads, railways, and factories, establish
schools at which a common language would be
taught, burn about 800 monasteries, drain and
clean and to a great extent rebuild the cities,
compel the whole population to wash regularly,
and kill all the stray dogs, there might in 50
years or so, be a resurrection in the Balkan
Peninsula. A sensible kind of Europe would
offer Austria the job and pass the hat round to
help pay the expenses. Almost the only real
civilisation in the Peninsula is that which
Austria has introduced in Bosnia and Herze-
govina, and this civilisation should have a chance
to spread.
Vacillating Vandemonia.
Recently a flood of new light has been thrown
on the method of how not to do things, as from
time out of date practised and approved in Van-
demonia. When the small-pox broke out in
Launceston two months and more ago, its imme-
diate effect was to cause a very unseemly and
absurd jangle between the Launceston Board of
Health, the Government, and the central health
authority of the State; the trouble arising pri-
marily from the fact that the Oentral Board of
Health meets in the capital, and is necessarily
regarded by Launceston as a degenerate and ac-
cursed institution. In Launceston the local Bumble
desired to treat the small-pox gently, caressing it
with timorous restrictions. The Central Board, on
the other hand, ordered precautions somewhat
more drastic than the strict necessities of the case
demanded. Thereupon Launceston got delirious
and yabbered of insurrection, and threatened to
capsize the empire. Here Propsting’s timid
Government took a hand and made the muddle
muddier. Dr. M ‘Call, Chief Secretary, went
to Launceston, breathing severe measures ; but
Launceston spoke ominously about withdrawing its
support from Premier Propsting’s Government,
and M‘Call became so tame that he would feed
out of the hand. Premier Propsting meantime
sat in Hobart and received deputations of devout
Hobartians, who demanded astonishing things.
To these Propsting replied that he would do
whatever the Central Board recommended. On
that the Central Board gladly gathered itself to-
gether and demanded the moon with great vehem-
ence, and M ‘Call, sitting subdued in Launceston,
said he’d see the Central Board further—or words
to that effect. The position then was that Prop-
sting and his Chief Secretary were pulling
different ways ; the Central Board was at logger-
heads with the Government; and both the
Central Board and the Government were cordially
ignored and scouted by the Local Board of Laun-
ceston. At that stage, all the Ministers went
to Launceston to talk things over with the
Bumble of those parts; with the result that
Dr. Gresswell, of Victoria, was applied to
for advice as to what might be the
best thing to do. Dr. Gresswell, realising that
the Public Health authority in Tasmania was in a
condition of Chaos and had lost its head, advised
that a mainland doctor be appointed to take
charge, and recommended Dr. Elkington. Prop-
sting’s timid Government forthwith appointed
Dr. Elkington. That expert arrived, and super-
seded every Vandemonian authority (the Govern-
ment included) ; and the epidemic was straight-
way got under. And now the Propsting Govern-
ment is so pleased with its success that it has
decided not to charge the cost of the smallpox
outbreak to this year’s revenue lest it should spoil
the beautiful Propsting surplus, but to put the
disease down as an asset till further notice.

The N.S.W. Land Revenue.
At the present time three motions relating, or
purporting to relate, to the iniquity of using land
sale money as revenue are mouldering on the
notice paper of the N.S.W. Assembly. Gormly,
M.L.A., proposes that the proceeds of land sales
should be applied to the repurchase of large
estates, that the lands thus resumed should be
leased to small holders, and that the surplus
derived from the properties should be used as
a Public Debt Sinking Fund. J. C. L. Fitz-
patrick urges that the land sale revenue
should be used as a sinking fund for the re-
payment of the public debt. Young, M.L. A.,
desires that it should be set apart as the
nucleus of a fund from which to meet, as far
as possible, the State’s obligations in regard
to interest on the National Debt.” Young’s idea
is too silly to be worth considering. The land-sale
revenue already goes to pay interest on the public
debt. As it amounts to about £1,000,000 a year,
and the interest bill is nearly £3,000,000 a year,
it would be absorbed every year, and there would
never be any fund and not much nucleus, and
things would be exactly where they are. In fact,
Young’s idea is only worth mentioning as a sam-
ple of long-winded imbecility. As regards the
proposal to apply the land sale revenue to the
repurchase of large estates, no country should go
in for the repurchase business until it has tried,
by a really heavy graduated land-tax, to make the
big estates dissolve automatically. _ If the
graduated land-tax went up to 6d. in the £
on the largest estates,, with an extra tax on
absentees, u.ore are very few large estates
that couldn’t cut themselves up and do it, too, in
much less time than the State would spend over
the business. The most sensible proposal of the
three is that the land-sale money should be
applied straight out in reduction of the public
debt. Probably, however, none of the proposals
will get so much as a hearing. In the bogged and
congested Parliament of N.S.W. very few tilings
do get a hearing, save motions for adjournment
and the like.

The Disastrous Middle Course.
“ The man who takes the middle course in a city
street is liable to be run over by a tram, ” is an
American aphorism which N.S.W. Premier See
should bear in mind. He is always taking a
“middle course” in political difficulties. The
perplexing situation created by the Upper House
rejection of the Amending Arbitration Bill has
been solved by him in a characteristic fashion.
That Bill embodied no new principle; it merely
provided somewhat better machinery for the
Arbitration Court, and declared positively an
obvious intention of the Legislature in pass-
ing the first Act, which intention had been
misunderstood. But, to save the skin of their
bogus union (the Machine Shearers’, which a fair
interpretation of arbitration law would destroy)
the squatters and squatters’ agents, who form a
majority of the Upper House, combined to throw
out the measure. It was a flagrantly indecent act
of class spite. Premier See's obvious duty was to
join issue with the Upper House and decide
whether the representatives of the people or a
coterie of squatters ruled the State. To this
he was urged by the Labor Party—urged, too.
with a threatening insistence. But that was too
bold a course for John See. It needed decision
and courage. So he “ negotiated ” with the Labor
Party, and the result is a compromise as discredit-
able to that party as it is to him. The Upper
House is to be left with the spoils of victory, but
a roundabout device is to be tried —by the appoint-
ment of a select committee of the Assembly to
make it look as if something were being done
when nothing is being done. The select com-
mittee will inquire into “the working of the
Arbitration Act”—that is to say, it will sit
as a Court of Review over the Arbitration
Court. Necessarily its deliberations will amount
to a contempt of court, and palpably its decision
—whatever it is—will not be worth twopence. It
can discredit but not coerce the Court. Particu-
larly good care has been taken by the blunderers
responsible for this move to see that the commit-
tee’s decision shall not even have the value of an
independent opinion, for its president will be a
high official of the A.W.U.— Mr. MacDonell— an
able man certainly and an honest one, but a man
who directly represents a body which is really the
plaintiff in the suit, so that the decision of the
commission over which he presides cannot possibly
be regarded with any respect. The middle course
adopted in this matter is the worst of muddle
courses. It will save John See from the present
trouble of being decisive and taking up a definite
attitude, and that is all. The A.W.U. will get
no benefit by it and the Labor party will earn the
odium of being willing to bring judicial proceed-
ings under the review of political partizans.
Good Roads.
The newest scheme of the ’Pootra Ministry,
barracked for by all the Melbourne papers—that
of providing good roads—needs more than careful
watching. Bent and Irvine are at present “ con-
sidering ” the question, while the farmer is
enthusiastically urging them to let themselves go
and darn the expense. Where the money is to
come from doesn’t appear —possibly it may arrive
from the same source as Shiels’ surplus—but if
the “ poor farmer ” and bis Ministry can work the
swindle they will do so. Bent says he is going to
“ load ” the lands benefited by the roads (Bent is
great on loading), and extra precautions are to be
taken “ to make it exceedingly difficult for obliga-
tions to be shirked.” Which blessed statement
will deceive nobody. The irrigation trusts, after
defrauding the State of hundreds of thousands of
pounds, are to-day shirking the very moderate
obligations that remain to them, with the consent
and connivance of Irvine and Bent. In connec-
tion with this ingenious scheme for getting cheap
roads the Argus’ Warragul correspondent lately
opened his mouth too wide. In reporting
the sale of two blocks of land at Mac-
Donald’s Track (Gippsland) he said: “The
blocks brought £8 18s. and £6 17s. 6d. an acre,
but they would admittedly have brought twice or
thrice the money but for the badness of the local
roads” (Argus, 21/8/’O3). So, the State is to
make the roads and thereby treble the value of
the landlord’s land, and the landlord is to pay a
portion of the cost provided Bent sends a
constable and a bailiff and makes him. There is
no other way to do so, unless Bent goes out and
bellows at him, and that would damage the
cattle through shock. If the farmer would but
use wide tires, from three to six inches, he
wouldn’t need to worry so much about his roads,
for he would himself make his road to a con-
siderable extent, besides putting much less work
on his cattle. There is a Width of Tires Act, but
it is inadequate, and, in a.ny case, is generally
disregarded. Moreover, it is quite time for the
State to help the farmer when that person has
tried to help himself and failed. So far he has
never yet tried. He never levies more than Is.
rate on himself —often not even that much and
as his land is always grossly undervalued this
really means but a 4d. or 6d. rate; and now he
whines that he can’t make his roads, and crawls
begging the city worker and the sweated public
servant to help him—these who pay from four to
six times as heavy rates as he. Furthermore, if
the farmer would but order Irvine to put a tax on
land values there would be no need for him to go
into the Gippsland ranges or the Beech Forest
or the Back of Beyond and other roadless
regions. There is land enough and to spare,
for all present requirements, within 100 miles
.of Melbourne markets. If this land were
settled, in blocks of 200 acres or so, and if the
farmer would have the honesty and decency to
levy on himself even half the rates paid by the
city artisan, he would be able to make the best of
roads, and would not need to show himself to the
rest of Australia as an abject agriculturist. Much
contemplation of worms (Gippsland grows the
biggest worm in Australia) seems to have de-
moralised the man on the land.
The Pastoralists’ "Buttoner.”
The people (and it is alleged that there are many
of them) who can’t quite see what harm there is
in having two unions registered for the same
calling under the Arbitration Act, ought to think
hard over the meaning of the manifesto which the
A.W.U. has just issued. This manifesto is
simply an intimation to members that, though the
executive does not approve of the terms, yet
members are authorised to accept the rates fixed
by agreement between the Pastoralists’ Union and
the bogus workers’ union, and filed by the Arbi-
tration Court as an award. Though the Arbitra-
tion Court has never dealt with the shearing
matter, yet an award of the court exists;
and, though that award may be the
result of a conspiracy, yet it is an award,
and prejudices any further proceedings. The
trouble lies in the adoption of the agreement
as an award of the Court. Nobody would think
of asking a court to adopt the testimonial of a
racecourse “buttoner” that his three-card trick
employer was a perfectly honest person who
always gave a pound’s worth for a sovereign ; and
nobody would expect a court to enter up that
testimonial as part of its own proceedings. Yet
that is practically what is done in connection
with the arbitration matter. The employer and
hisbuttoner ” agree, upon a certain thing, and,
if the “buttoner” is registered, no matter how
ridiculous the agreement is, it becomes an award
of the court. Then when an honest person who
has probably been badly taken down some
time in the past comes along and says that
the three-card trick employer is a fraud and doesn t
give a fair thing, the court has to point to the fact
that there is on record in its own books an award
to the effect that he is an honest and upright
person and straight dealer who is giving all that
anybody has a right to expect. It would be a
very great pity if voluntary agreements could not
be made awards of the court, because that process
often saves time and unpleasantness; but if it is
impossible to prevent bogus unions (unions of
employers’ “buttoners”) from getting regis-
tration, then an effort will have to be
made to get the other provision struck out,
and so confine the awards of the court
to the matters which the Court itself has dealt
with. The better way certainly would be to pre-
vent the registration of bogus unions; but if the
Employers’ Unions are too strong to allow their
“buttoners” to be sacrificed, then, the other plan
must be tried; for it is absolutely certain that, if
the bogus award isn’t killed somehow, it will kill
arbitration.
«
The Population Question.
This letter comes from the fertile, thinly-peopled
south-west of Victoria, where the big landlords
are
A recent Age leader is responsible for this on the
population question :
“ Our forefathers furnished examples of cheerful unsel-
fishness by bringing up families of six on an ordinary
income. We do not follow their example, and are
lapsing from their high standard. Our falling birth-rate
shows a relaxing of the moral fibre disquieting in so
young a nation. The conditions here all favor expansion ;
immigration has ceased, and a continent is literally
begging for population. Coghlan’s figures show another
serious aspect of our national life. Of the first-born for
each year one quarter were illegitimate, and another
quarter were saved by the hasty marriage of their
parents.”
There is nothing to be wondered at in all this. Man
has two powerful instincts—self-preservation and race-
preservation, which govern his life. Limit the healthy
exercise of either, and you must be prepared for abnormal
results. David Syme is amongst the few people who own
all that is worth owning of this vast begging continent
we hear so much about, and they have a hired agitator
flying in the face of the Lord of the shining universe
by stating the poor should not marry, and he is paid
to do his best to still further reduce wages, the chance of
marriage and a decent existence, and to sit on the safety
valve of our national life. The so-called closer settlement
going on in Victoria throws a strong light on its falling
birth-rate and want of chastity. Once view the miser-
able kipsies of the unfortunate rack-rented tenants on
the wind-swept plains, where fairly-educated women toil
almost the full round of the clock, and bare-footed, ill-
clothed children run about the apology for a home, and
you get a sobering view of the marriage and population
question which explains many things. The tenant-
farmers of S.W. Victoria and their wives are only sup-
posed to toil that absentee landlords may live in idle
luxury, and manure firms pay 25 per cent, dividends, and
Yankee machine firms rake in their 10 per cent, from the
fruits of the farmers’ toil. The vast begging continent’s
hypocrisy is very transparent in the light of the unholy
rush for the land made available by Taverner, though
competent authorities state the average of it will not
carry one beast to thirty acres, and the eager competition
for land where it will take half a life-time to clear enough
for a garden, and the other half to make a decent track
to the nearest cemetery. Out up the big estates in
localities where there is a sure rainfall and railway com-
munication, develop our iron deposits, and stop import-
ing commodities we can grow for ourselves, and the
solution of the marriage problem, limitation of population
problem, and even, to a great extent, of the illegitimacy
problem will be arrived at.
From Tasmania:
Premier Profsting, of Tasmania, already finds himself
in a very uncomfortable and hazardous position. The
most that the worst of the taxdodgers asked of Lewis was
that the exemption under the income-tax should he raised
to £l5O or £2OO. On the hustings, Propsting pledged
himself to the taxdodgers to an extraordinary extent.
He proposes not to collect the taxon incomes derived
from personal exertion ; and, as the taxdodger is still a
sort of power in the land, Propsting is driven to push the
absurd proposal through. One or two facts, as instancing
its absurdity. In Hobart Brownell Bros., the big
drapers, will pay income-tax, being a company ; but
J. P. Fitzgerald, an equally big draper, doing a solid
cash business, will not pay. The Cascade Brewery, being
a company, will pay income-tax; Adams’ Brewery, being
owned by George himself, will not pay under Propsting’s
policy. The theory is that George’s income is derived
from personal exertion. Of course, the chief difficulty
lies in the fact that Propsting can’t afford to lose
the income-tax of Fitzgerald, Adams and co. The small-
pox in Launceston will cost the State, in direct expendi-
ture, at least £20,000; and the indirect loss of revenue
will be very large indeed. Also, the progressive measures
introduced by Propsting —absentee-tax, death-duties and
the like-will almost certainly not pass the House of Dodery.
True, there is an understanding that this Government
is prepared to deal with the House of Dodery ; but so far
the threats of Propsting have not even made the Dead-
house turn over in its grave. As Propsting is deeply
pledged to go to the country if he doesn’t get what
he wants, that broken Prop’s position promises to be
uncomfortable.
For months past Melbourne Age leading articles
have been dotted over with insidious attacks
Victoria’s national system of education. The
very latest move is to fasten the illegitimacy and
want of chastity, set forth by Coghlan, oh to the
godless system of free education. A recent leader
makes this picturesque assertion :
Fathers and mothers used to get weekly practice in
parental prudence and self-denial when they had to lay
aside the needful sum to pay for the week’s schooling. In
these days Government manages the whole business, and
parents and children lose the moral advantage of sacri-
ficing voluntarily the lower thing for the higher.
The unfortunate thing is that these old-time
parents, instead of practising the beautiful virtue
of self-denial for the sake of their children’s edu-
cation, simply, in an immense proportion of cases,
let the children grow up like the beasts of the
field. The result was that, in 1861, 40 per cent,
of the Victorian population couldn’t even
write. Now the proportion is down to 17
per cent. —practically all young children. But
the reform was achieved after a hard struggle.
When free and compulsory education was intro-
duced, hundreds of the Age’s self-sacrificing
Earents who wanted to keep their children at
ome in blank ignorance and use them for cow-
milking, had to be dragged before the courts. As
a further and still stronger evidence—as late as
1871,18 per cent, of the adults married in Victoria
couldn’t sign their names—self-sacrificing parents
had brought them up with the liberal education
of the ox. In 1901 only 1 per cent, of the people
married were in this state of ignorance. Victoria
has no ambition to go back to the old system and
rely on the self-sacrificing parent.
The hob-nailed boot of (Johen has such a terrify-
ing effect on some electors—usually those who
claim plaintively to “ have a stake in the country”
—that a public meeting at Melbourne to discuss
the Federal capital could not be held without
those who look part having the wrath of the
British money-lender flung at them. Writing to
the Argus after the amusing upset of the ’Pootra
meeting, “A Kyabramite Reformer” moans, “I
would like to ask what the British capitalist will
think of the meeting of last Monday night?”
The utter unmanliness which makes it impossible
to pass a remark about the weather without
wondering whether Cohen will object to it, seems
to afflict a lot of citizens just at present; and the
only wonder is that a “Society for Being
Polite and Nice to Cohen ” hasn’t been started.
Nine-tenths of the “right-thinking” persons in
Melbourne now wander about, with a pained and
apprehensive expression, the result of wondering
what is going to happen with the £5,000,000 loan
that falls due in a few months. Men who haven’t
seen a £5 note for years, and who have the idea
that £lO notes are no longer printed, scan the
commercial columns of the dailies and shake their
heads dolefully over the outlook. When anybody
says anything about droughts or swine-fever,
these demented patriots say “Hush” loudly, and
explain th* Irvine sits up all night planning the
conversion of the big loan. If Cohen had. the
slightest idea of the gibbering, subservient,
palsy-stricken condition of Melbourne’s ‘‘public
men ” at present, all chance of converting the
loan would vanish. A decent-minded Cohen
would prefer to deal with Dick Swiveller than
with men of this type.

Matrimonially, Sydney is fairly sudden, but
if Sydney is sudden, Shakspeare’s Illyria, now on
view at Sydney Royal, was instantaneous Orsino,
its duke, is making no end of an ass of himself for
love of Olivia; no woman’s heart is big enough to
hold as much as his for her. Yet inside half an
hour he is tied to Viola, even before (having dis-
guised herself) she has time to take the trousers
on; a,nd Viola, m spite of the embarrassment of
breeches, had almost as suddenly made up her
mind that Orsino’s was the only beard for her.
iwo other cases of equal swiftness occur. You
never know what couple is going to turn up
married. The noble Olivia, who isn’t
going to even see a man for seven years,
sees Sebastian for the first time; and in-
side 10 minutes the local hasty-marriage parson
has realised another fee- —the lady had apparently
had hmi chained up on the premises, not knowing
at what moment she might want to go off. And
it is casually mentioned during the subsequent
very brief proceedings that another couple, who
couldn’t be suspected of it an hour before, has
done the same thing in the interval. In this
sultry atmosphere Shakspeare incubated his
Twelfth Night,” giving to it as a second title
What You Will, ”by way of intimation that he
was rather tired just then, and wasn’t going to
worry himself into a decline thinking up names
for his play.
* * * *
And “ Twelfth Night ” might have almost
been written by a modern for the modern stage.
Perhaps that is why it is so rarely seen there ; we
like to think of the “national bard” as one who
did things that nobody nowadays could approach.
Any way, Plain Bill Holloway was Australia’s
last Malvolio, and Essie Jenyns its last Olivia,
and that was back in the middle eighties. Cer-
tainly, staged Shakspeare is nowadays expected
to spell Spectacular Gorgeousness, and this piece
does not lend itself to that sort of thing to any
great extent. Yet the scene in Olivia’s garden is
very fine stagecraft, and stage-manager Coe, in
the heavy disguise of a coffee-colored mariner, has
to come out and bow for it; and, again, while the
orchestra plays something appropriate from Beet-
hoven, a terrific storm on the stage is wrecking
Miss Dora Rignold in a colored nightgown.
* * *
There is more laughter for the modern
audience in ‘'-Twelfth Night” than in almost
anything else that Shakspeare wrote; and in
Musgrove’s playing version, the original five
acts being condensed to three, the comedy, bor-
dering most of the time on broad farce, is not
much cut. Not Olivia, Viola, and the Duke
are the principals, but roystering Sir Toby, the
imbecile Aguecheek, pompous Malvolio, the
steward, impish Maria, and the Clown. Of these
the Clown alone is not built to appeal to the
gallery in 1903. W. H. Denny is the Malvolio.
It may be difficult to present a Malvolio that does
not appear exaggerated ; and here, as in Bottom,
Denny seems at times to be extravagant. Yet,
especially in the last scene, his performance is just
about perfect. Miss Milton’s Maria is a more
even work, excellent throughout. Athol Forde’s
Sir Toby and Croker-King’s fantastic Ague-
cheek may be bracketed as satisfactory. Ken-
ningham is introduced as the Clown ; and
though the Clown’s humor does not appeal
to the popular taste of to-day, Kenningliam’s
voice always does. As Shakspeare wrote it
the Clown’s is the one singing part, with five
songs ; in this playing version Kemiingham takes
four, and Miss Rignold the fifth. Every number
is a success ; Kenuingham’s “The Rain it Raineth
Every Day ” deserves the roar of applause it gets.
The sober people don’t, however, appeal with the
strength of the others. Norman Partridge is an
undistinguished Duke ; and except that Miss Nora
Kerin looks just as every Countess should look,
she is an indifferent-Olivia. Though Miss Rignold
gives some of her fine lines admirably, her Viola
lacks distinction. On the whole, however, besides
regarding “Twelfth Night” as better suited to
modern popular taste than “Midsummer Night’s
Dream,” the writer, at any rate, regards the acting
as better ; and, if there isn’t a Dawn in the Forest
in “Twelfth Night,” there is Kenningham’s voice,
and that is worth a good deal of dawn.

“My Lady Molly,” at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney), still allows Captain Harold Romney to
lay h;s heart at her feet, and to do it to music.
That brave gallant and his rival, Bland, have
Ceased to make the tinsmith noise with their
swords as if a duel were in progress, but
Florence Young still announces that “she isn’t a
highwayman, nor any kind of a man”—to the
great joy of people who much prefer her as a
woman, For the rest, the limbs of the ballet are
as beautiful as ever, and the early Victorian
bonnets of the chorus are so appreciated that they
are being copied and worn by Sydney Society.
** * *
The two noted pianists, Florence Menk-
meyer and Hambourg, who have been appearing
simultaneously in Sydney, have not been treated
very well in the matter of audiences. Both played
to nearly empty halls. That section of Sydney-
aiders which talks with passionate admiration of
Vabgner and Motezart and Shykufsky was the very
section that stopped away. But then this is the '
section that will sit up all night playing coon and
cake-walk music. Possibly if Miss Menkmeyer
had been better business-managed she would have
been more of a financial success. And if
Lemmone and the little Batchelor girl (who
has a lark’s voice) had left Mark and Bore-us
out of the programme, they would have banked
quite a plump sum However, peace be with
their pieces—from prelude to finale.

Westminster Abbey Glee and Concert
Party opened to a hall (Sydney Town Hall)
packed as it used to be for Melba and Castles.
The six boys are so fresh and cherubic,
and have sweet voices and wear Eton
clothes. Not the football class of boy at
all, but the Carlylean boy who ought to be
brought up underground. Madame Marie
Hooton and the other grown-ups are very good—
for grown-ups, but it is the little boys that the
audience loves.

“A Life’s Revenge,” the new Sydney
Criterion production, is one of those cheap-and-
nasty things which consist of throwing the alleged
vices of our neighbors upon the broad white
screen of our own alleged national virtues.
It was just this sort of thing, presented, not
so much, certainly, on the stage as in the
press, that not long ago made possible a cruel
and cowardly war, which cost us a good deal of
national respect and over £200,000,000. It may
be readily admitted that the materials, such as
they are, are handled with considerable skill in
the present Criterion production. A rising
young Russian artist is in love with a Russian
princess ; and so is a wicked Russian prince.
The prince strikes the artist; the artist
whips him with the knout snatched from the
prince’s own serf-whipper. The prince wants
revenge. Orloff, the serf-spanker, is appealed to
for a plan. He is a serf himself ; he offers to tell
the prince a plan as the price of his liberty and
his son’s, lie tells it —the artist is the prince’s
own born serf; but he doesn’t know it. To save
herself from the prince, the princess marries the
artist. So, the artist being the prince’s serf, his
wife also becomes his serf; and the prince
can do what he likes with both of them. Then,
in the midst of the revenge, the prince hands
Orloff the promised release of himself and son.
The son is the artist; and the wicked prince is
foiled. English characters supply most of the
comedy or farce; though usually standing
round and making jokes, they are always
on hand to biff the villain in the eye;
and the villain looks up and damns England, and
says he would biff the Englishman back, only
Miss Beatrice Holloway is a likeable princess,
who fights a sword duel with another princess
(Miss Conroy), and gets the best of it. If some-
body would take Miss Holloway aside and, before
it is too late,_ implore her to open her mouth and
say “will” instead of “wee-eel,” she would be
even a greater success than she is. Vivian
Edwards is the handsome young artist, and does
his best work of the season ; Hodson is in a new
role as principal clown, and does his fooling
cleverly; Albert Lucas is a satisfactory Orloff;
and Godfrey Cass makes a very poor fist of the
Russian prince. The “Revenge” will be played
for a month ; and then a rising young actor named
Alfred Dampier will join the co.
** * *
On Friday of this week “The Worst
Woman in London” will give over making things
uncomfortable for Inman at the Lyceum, and
“ The Power .and The Glory ” will be revived on
Saturday. Miss Eugenie Duggan, who, so far, has
not been in the Lyceum cast this season, will
reappear.
*# * *
There is no doubt as to Augustus Thomas’
skill as a dramatist. The man, whose name is
one-half ancient Emperor and the other half
modern bootmaker, can make plays which are all
human nature. “In Mizzouri ” and “Arizona”
are a good pair on which to claim a reputation.
Production of the former by the Frawley Co., at
Sydney Palace last Saturday, necessarily chal-
lenged comparison with a former staging of the
piece here by Nat Goodwin and co. On that com-
parison it shows poorly in places, some of the actors
rather spoiling, with comedy business, characters
which were quite funny enough without it. The
Dave of J. R. Amory was a notable example of
this. But the principal roles were well sustained.
Miss Van Buren added to her reputation as a
skilled and versatile actress, as Kate Vernon, and
Daniel Frawley gave a forcible and natural ren-
dering of Jim Radburn. In picturesque character
parts Miss Christine Hill and Jeffrey Williams
were as good as they were in “Arizona”—which
is saying a great deal. The Frawley season closes
to-morrow (Friday) with a revival of “ Arizona ”
—taking them all in all, its best piece. The co.
has given to the public, always carefully and
sometimes brilliantly, four interesting American
plays, and a return visit with more of the same
sort would be welcome.
* * * *
For the forthcoming week “ the Players ”
hold Sydney Palace and will produce “Dandy
Dick” and “Sowing the Wind” by leave of
Robert Brough, and, being a more than ordinarily
good amateur organisation, will do it in such a
way, probably, as not to make Robert Brough
regret his leave. Then the Willoughby Geach
Co. opens a season of merriment.
** * *
At Wirths’ Circus, the heathen Chinee
who balances himself on the point of a
needle stuck into the back of a chair on the end
of a revolving ladder is wearing a slightly worried
look in his slant eyes. Last week Gov. Rawson
turned an interested eye on the gamble, but did
not show any wild desire to bet on the result,
though Pagel’s lion certainly seems a good enough
investment at even money. There were hopes
that his Excellency would have broken up the
Howard Brothers by producing one of his West
African horror curios, something so dreadful that
when the investigating Howard telegraphed to
his blindfolded brother, that party would be
seized with the idea the investigator had got
suddenly drunk. But his Excellency merely
showed a medal. Up to date there has been no
reason for adding any more sensations to the
show, but in the event of the attendance falling
off it is understood that the management will
arrange further amazing shocks.
** * *
Mr. W. J. Wilson, the well-known scenic
artist and theatrical manager, and one-time
partner with the late Signor Majeroni, is to be
tendered a testimonial matinee performance at
Sydney Palace, on the 17th. Many influential
patrons—including the Governor-General, State
Governor, Premier Barton, State Premier See,
the. Admiral, Mayor, Consuls, etc. —are lending
their support, and the pomp and fashion of Sydney
are to be there unanimously.
** * #
At Sydney Tivoli, Hill and Sylvainy, who,
as examples of strength and grace, make even that
wearisome thing, trick cycling, good entertain-
ment, are giving a short farewell season of a few
nights. Fields, the juggler, is the other big
attraction. Sydney Tivoli rather wants a nice
girl now—a girl with a good voice, and a knowledge
of dancing, and a smile like an early Spring sun-
rise—someone of the Lottie Collins type. The
only valid reason that a variety theatre has for
existence is that it can give a nice g irl a chance
to have all the stage to herself, with no “ support ”
except what Nature has provided.

The normal population of Melbourne was
swollen by a crowd of agricultural visitors last
week, and most of the contingent from the
interior crowded to see “Are You a Mason ” at
th© Princess’s. This old-fashioned farcical comedy,
adapted by an Anglicised German gentleman
from the work of two other Germans, seems to be
specially adapted for holiday audiences. It isn’t
the sort of farce that sends a cold, experienced
world into convulsions of laughter. An ordinarily
frequent theatre-goer, who has gazed at many
mothers-in-law and grown weary of their
hen-pecked relatives, asks nowadays for a
pinch of probability in a basin of thin
dramatic soup. “Are You a Mason” is
very thin soup, with no suggestion of prob-
ability in the mixture. The principal men
characters hardly pretend to be sane citizens,
except when they are conversing briskly
together, and then they talk on lines of inter-
ruption, where each speaker in turn takes
words from the other fellows mouth to save
time. If the plot were built on a human
foundation this scribe would humbly re-
tract his last week’s misstatement re Angelina,
who turns up from an imaginary grave and is
charged with being the mother of Amos Blood-
good’s unborn twins. The previous notice wrong-
fully stated that Angelina was never married to
Amos, or otherwise subjected to any risk of twins,
whereas the narrative refers to her as the divorced
wife of Amos aforesaid. After considering the
case in all its bearings this scribe prefers to cling
to his mistake. The idea that Amos had been
dreaming of indiscretions which never took place
was more humorous than the author’s idea of
divorcing Angelina without giving any particulars
of the legal proceedings. Who was the co-
respondent in the case, anyhow?
** * *
At Melbourne Royal it is refreshing to
find the Bland Holt Co. engaged upon a work that
shakes up its mental faculties and puts the mem-
bers in sympathy with their parts. “The Golden
Ladder has patches of real merit—scenes of sus-
tained interest, genuine dramatic effects, and bits
of pathos. At its worst, it is fair, average melo-
drama; at its best, it rises nearly to “Silver
King level. The second act, which has been
revised, and brought up to date, introduces the
British Fiag under claptrap conditions, and makes
Kev. Walter Baker look a foolish parson, teaching
Terewth to China whilst the Boxers howl at his
gates. Also the drama’s brief incursion into
Chowland directs unfavorable attention to Miss
Ross’s besetting sin as an actress. Miss Ross
rarely gets away from her simper, and in this hour
of imminent peril she expresses her devotion to
the parson with the same coquettish simper as
usual, although they have been married six years,
and their intelligent offspring and themselves
are likely to be disembowelled by Boxers
before the sun goes down upon the pagans’
wrath. The other three acts of “The Golden
Ladder ” have nothing to do with Britain’s sym-
bolical .bunting, or the Chinese question. The
heavy- villain spreads himself on his native
English shore, and Miss Ross is “jugged” for
shooting him by accident, and Baker sorrows to
great advantage, and Bland Holt, the benevolent
elaerly pastrycook, gently reproves his wife for
being too business-like as regards Baker’s board
and lodging.
** * *
A week of “ Sherlock Holmes ” is winding
up the season of Cuyler Hastings and co. at Her
Majesty s (Melb.). There’s a certain method
about the madness of the Sherlock story, a calm
cool air of consistency which compels respect and
strikes the sceptic dumb. The plot is a fine piece
of impudence adorned by big splashes of darkness
weird limelight eccentricities, and the ruddy glow
of an alleged cigar-end. In its purely melodramatic
way, Sherlock ”is a triumph of the preposterous,
a splendid imposition, a feast of unreason, and
a thing to be seen more than once. With
one exception, the cast of characters is what
it was a while ago. Cuyler Hastings repeats him-
self as the dreamy man of action ; Miss Chevalier
is the dreamy .young woman with the tearful voice
a,nd lunacy in the family ; Miss Lane continues to
stand and fall by the same scowling Larrabee as
before; and Atholwood is again the elderly pro-
fessor who talks into the fatal tube. But Cregan
alas !is no longer Augustus Glover. One misses
the huge voice and rolling eye of Augustus de-
ceased, and hopes that the souls of the citizens he
put away will bear no witness against him.
* * * *
This is preliminary to mentioning that the
dramatisation of Tolstoy’s novel, bearing the
creepy title of “Resurrection,” will be staged at
Her Majesty’s next Saturday. Tolstoy, as some
people don’t know, is a superior Russian demo-
crat, who once wrote a rather naughty story about
a sonata, but is an intensely moral reformer all
the same—so moral, in fact, that he “refuses to
take any fees arising from the play founded on his
book (advt.). The cause of humanity would get
along just the same if he took the fees; neverthe-
less, Tolstoy remains obdurate on the question of
cash. A play adapted from the novel of so pecu-
liar a person ought to be interesting. It will cer-
tainly be an impressive show, and the new com-
pany. selected in distant Britain for “Resurrec-
tion ’ purposes, will include two well-remembered
Australian favorites—Miss Maud Jeffries and
Julius Knight, alias Marcus Superbus.
* *• * *
Mark Hambourg is returning to Mel-
bourne for a few re-appearances at the Town
Hall, a building where Mark’s genius can be more
comfortably appreciated in September than in
mid-winter. The first of the Hambourg concerts
will have Marshall-Hall’s orchestra in the enter-
tainment. The famous concerto by the composer
whose name begins with Tschai and ends with
kowsky is a hysterical delight in store for the
musical Elect, likewise a pleasure for the common
or garden Goth. This orchestral concert is to
happen on Saturday afternoon (12th). Subse-
quently the Hambourg brethren, Mark and Boris,
perform without an orchestra on Tuesday evening,
Wednesday afternoon, and on two later occasions.
** * *
At the Opera House the programme is
practically what it was last week and the week
before that. Dan Crawley has changed a song,
perhaps, and the first part has changed a girl, but
the Hallen-Fuller sketch still relates to the matter
of Broncho Bill, and Madame Marzella’s birds are
the principal attraction as before. The birds
drew tons of patronage to Rickards’ during Show
Week Their last nights are announced, but the
farewell seems likely to be of a lingering character,
and an extra Saturday matinee remains a feature
of the boom. Understood that the Manila
cockatoo who somersaults backwards has protested
against these extra Saturday matinees in language
quite unfit for publication.
* * * #•
Dan Barry passed away from the Adelaide
Royal with yet another speech, and with one night
of “East Lynne.” D.B. told a flattered but
openly incredulous audience that Little Willie
would ascend to heaven in the care of “real
angels,” Adelaide being the only place where he
had been able to obtain them. Most of the regu-
lar theatregoers, who had carefully stayed awaj'
from the Barry season, treated William Anderson’s
“Mariners of England” spectacle similarly, but
business improved rapidly when it was found to be
well mounted and fairly well acted. Harry Diver,
as Nelson, took most of the honors; and Miss
Helene Burdette, as the heroine, most of what
honors were left. But after a week the
co. came down to a moderate kind of detective
story about a Face at a Window. Cuyler Hastings
(who has not been seen in Adelaide yet) is
announced to produce his superior detective story
at an early date. Rudinoff is also imminent
at the Tivoli, where Hill and Sylvainy have
fallen downstairs on a single buggy-wheel for
the last time. That remarkable comedian, Grace
Emmett, left at the same time, and at present
cycle-racing on the stage is the chief attraction,
the indoor championship of S. A. being contested.
Lemare has descended upon the Town Hall, and
given a series of recitals on the big organ, which
he pronounces as easy to play, but badly in want
of up-to-date fixings.

A letter from Wellington (M.L.) :
John P. Sheridan has finished an attenuated
season at the Opera House with “Mrs. Dooley’s
Little Joke.” Nobody discovered the joke. The
season has been productive of “The Lady-
Slavey,” “Cinderella,” “Fun on the Bristol” (for the
752,956,?05th time), “ When the Lamps are Lighted,” the
aforementioned infinitesimal joke, and little cash. John
F.’s shrill Irishisms become more unintelligible with each
visit, but the ballet of the present company is like unto a
beer spring in a prohibition district. Maggie Moore
lifts up her youthful, middle-aged voice in glad
and sad Irish song in “ Killarney ” at the Opera House.
As far as Wellington is concerned, “ Killarney ” has been
considerably discounted by Premier Seddon stating that
the lakes at the place of that name are not nearly so beauti-
ful as many in Maoriland. The Irish vote totters in the
balance on this account. P. R. Dix hangs on the Theaue
Royal with a big variety company of passable calibre.
John Coleman was tried for a week, but he seemed ill
and unable to “scarecrow” worth his old hat.
Phil May’s drawings, for exhibition at 324
George-street next week, might form the nucleus
of a national portrait gallery. The politicians of
the eighties, the actors, the society people and
public functionaries, are drawn and caricatured to
the life. Here to-day’s “old men,” the veterans,
may see how they looked when in their prime—a
Dibbs erect and sprightly, a Reid almost slender
by comparison with the corpulent hero of 1903.
The “patriots” who Mafficked in Aus-
tralia when the Boers raised the siege of Barnum-
Powell will be interested to learn these facts, as
ascertained by the Pall Mall Gazette :
The town guard of Mafeking, who held the inner works
during eight months, have not been given the pay they
were promised in addition to their trench allowance; the
troopers have not been paid v/hat was due to them in lieu
of rations ; Oonolly, one of the two men who turned out
the gun, and kept Baden-Powell supplied with the shells
that went far to save Mafeking, received only £5 as an
honorarium, and Coghlan, the other man, received noth-
ing beyond trade pay.

have ascertained that the Mond Gas Co. of Staffordshire
have accepted the tender of Mephan Ferguson, of Mel-
bourne, for the supply of about 13 miles of Ferguson’s
Patent Lockingbar Steel Pipes, from 18 inches to 36 inches
diameter. The machinery for manufacturing these pipes
has all been made at Ferguson’s General Engineering
Works, Footscray, and shipped to Tipton, in Staffordshire,
where the branch works are being erected. The same
firm have also erected engineering and pipe works at

At the end of August last year Queensland had £198,705
towards paying the year’s interest bill, which amounted
to £1,509,182, and it wound up with a deficit of £191,341.
This year it has so far only £190,821 saved up ; so at the
present rate of going it will have a deficit of within a few
pounds of £200,000 at the end of the current year. Its
monthly interest bill is £125,765; and it has so far
averaged only £95,410 to meet the bill. And Queensland
still sleeps on !

It isn’t a very good start to make. Westralia for a few
years past has dodged a deficit, being helped thereto by
its special local tariff ; but that tariff is gradually disap-
pearing, and it has not so far made any serious effort to
increase its other revenue or reduce its expenditure to
make up for that loss. The month’s railway revenue was
in fact £5452 less than it was for August, 1902, and the
company dividend-tax £6427 less.

* * * *
The annual report of the N.S.W. Railway Com-
missioners, now given to the Assembly, does not make
the position look any better than did the preliminary
figures compiled a month ago. There is a confession, in
fact, that “ the year under review has been, financially,
the most disastrous in the history of the railways of the
State.” The admitted deficit, reckoning interest at 3.552
per cent., was £425,879. The actual deficit was, however,
greater than that, because of the failure to charge a very
considerable sum to the capital account. The principal
disputed item is the £1,000,000 which was handed to the
Commissioners, when first they took office, to put the
railways into good order ; this amount they never have
charged to capital, on the ground that for years previously
the lines and stock had been neglected. But the public
is not interested in that quibble; what concerns it is
that the million was borrowed and spent and interest has
to be paid on it. If, then, all the proper charges are
made, the interest bill will be increased by something
over £85,000, and the year’s railway deficit will pass
£510,000. This is independent of a tramway deficit of
£19,396. The admitted capital cost of the railways was
£41,654,977, on which the interest is £1,474,473. In view
of the fact that railways, no matter how patched, go to
ruin, and rolling stock becomes obsolete, a sinking fund
of at least 1£ per cent, should be provided for. If that
were done £2,099,296 would be required for the year
above working expenses. The earnings were £3,314,893,
the expenses £2,266,299, leaving £1,048,594 to go towards
interest and sinking fund. With such a sinking fund,
then, as any honest trading firm would deem necessary,
the railway accounts for the year would show up
£1,217,705 to the bad.
* * * *
Probably the worst feature of the N.S.W. rail-
way position, next to the recent rapid addition of appar-
ently hopeless lines, is the fact that a large number of
old lines don’t seem any nearer paying now than
years ago. Here is the record of the losses made by
three or four for the last few years :
1898. 1900. 1902. 1903.
Junee to Hay .. .. £14,476 £19,057 £19,679 £16,772

There surely ought to be some point where the advan-
tages gained by “developing the country” will
definitely show themselves. The fact that many lines
don’t seem to be getting any nearer that point sug-
gests a doubt whether they really have “developed
the country "at all in the sense of improving it Any-
how, it is an unquestionable fact that most of the Western
half of the State is worth a good deal less now than it was
before the State spent a good many millions in building
railways to develop it.

Twelve months ago the co. had, on paper, £9171 of paid
capital over and above the deficit; of £lll,lOO it had lost
£101,929. Now it has lost all but £9089. Further, a
suspense account, which may be regarded as some sort of
reserve, has been reduced by £523 (from £2563 to £2040).
On the other hand, some progress has been made in the
reduction of liabilities to the public (deposits and mort-
gages, etc.), which have moved in this way :
1895 .. .. £178,466 1900 .. .. £83,084
1896 .. .. 142,844 1901 .. .. 67,617

1898 .. .. 107,059 1903 .. .. 58,301
1899 .. .. 96,092
In other words, since 1895 the co. has reduced its liabili-
ties to the public to the extent of £120,165, but in order
to do so it has lost £88,048 of its capital. And it still has
£58,301 of outside liabilities to liquidate. At the same
rate, in order to complete the liqu.dation, the securities
would have to be helped by capital to the extent of a
little over £25,000. And, on paper, there is only £9089
of capital intact to do it with. It is a tight corner to
get into.
* * * *
No doubt for good and sufficient reasons,
balance-sheets and statements of accounts don’t figure
very largely in the plan of campaign of the Independent
Order of Foresters. A request to the “ head office for
Australia ” of this weird assurance concern brings, how-
ever, certain papers relating to the business for 1901;
similar information was sought regarding 1900 and 1902,
but it is not available. That figures for only one year out
of three should be forthcoming can’t be regarded as quite
satisfactory. The Red Indian’s total net income for the
year 1901 was £524,621. The total expenses were £62,496.
This includes £37,769 “reserved for contingencies.” If
this latter amount were really reserved, it should, and no
doubt would, be included among the reserves ; but it is
not so shown and does not appear in the balance-sheet.
It is tolerably clear, therefore, that the alleged reserve
was promptly spent, and that, instead of the expenses
being £24,727 as alleged, they were really £62,496. On
that basis the expenses amounted to £lO 183 3d. .per cent,
of the total income shown in the balance-sheet. That
would be very moderate if it were all, but when the Red
Indian concern spends nearly 11 per cent, of the ordinary
income, and charges the insured heavy “ court dues ” as
well, and spends them without putting them into the
balance-sheet, it becomes, to the small insurer, a ridicu-
lously expensive affair. And in • return for its high
expense rate (much higher to the small insurer than the
rate of many Australian offices), and in consideration of
the fact that it charges more (court dues included) for a
£lOO policy than any good Australian office, how
does the security look? At last valuation the A.M.P.
Society had £17,022,045 to cover liabilities of a
present value of £16,379,150, a surplus of £642,895.
When the same sort -of investigation'of the Red
Indian’s affairs was made, the then value of its
liabilities was £7,159,342, and it had £518,724 wherewith
to meet them. In other words, the Red Indian had a
deficiency of £6,640,618. Thus, the only possible chance
of meeting liabilities lay in a vast proportion of the in-
surers dropping out and losing every penny that they had
put into the concern ; if they could be persuaded
that the concern was good enough to stay in, and
they stayed in, then the concern would become hopeless.
If the Red Indian Society were, in some legitimate way,
making very large profits now, the position, bad though
it looked at the last actuarial investigation, might be
improved. The society isn’t, however, doing anything
of the kind. On the contrary, its earnings are small. At
the beginning of 1901 it had funds amounting to £883,920.
At the end of the year they were £1,020,710. Interest and
dividends were £37,938. On the mean of the funds the
return was, therefore £3 19s. Bd. per cent. On the same
basis of calculation the A.M.P.’s earnings for the same
year were £4 9s. 6d. per cent. Comparing the Australian
Society, then, with the Red Indian concern, these things
so far show out:
(1) The Australian had a substantial surplus at its last
valuation, and the R. 1., on the same basis, had a huge
deficiency.
(2) The Red Indian expense rate is higher—apparently
the insurer has to pay a good bit for the privilege of
having “ supreme chief rangers ” and other such strange
creatures with names like Oronhyatekha.
(3) Oronhyatekha is earning far less with the R.I. in-
surer’s money than the Australian society is earning.
There are a few interesting things beside
these which the 1.0.F.’s balance-sheets and schedules
show. In Victoria (where the head - office for
Australia is) there were in force on Dec. 31, 1901,
655 policies, purporting to insure the holders for
£108,700. The balance-sheet shows the total assets of
the order to be £1,055,802, of which £7021 is stated to be
invested in Victoria—£7o2l to cover £108,700 ! There
certainly is a further item of £70,638, “ cash on deposit,”
and possibly Victoria has a few pounds of that as well ;
but even if it has its full amount in proportion to the sum
assured, the total would be only about £lOlO. In Vic-
toria, then, where the head office for Australia is, and
where presumably it has most, if not all, of its Australian
securities, it seems, as far as can be estimated, that about
£BOOO is held to secure payment of £108,700 ! Probably
this would not matter much if the concern had a sub-
stantial surplus elsewhere, but when it has a huge
deficiency elsewhere—well, it looks very much as though,
should the threatened collapse come, the Australian
policyholder’s deficiency would be rather more than
ordinary.
The Red Indian concern gives no surrender
value ; so that, when a man becomes convinced that the
security isn’t good enough, or if reverses come and he
can’t meet one payment when due, he loses everything he
has paid. And yet this has been represented as a form of
assurance specially suited to the wage and salary earner
—the person who, of all persons, being at any time liable
to temporarily lose his income, ought to see to it that! a
surrender value provision is attached to his policy to keep
it alive till he is able to pay. In 1901 the forfeited policies
numbered 12,929, and were for £2,438,608. This represents
an appalling loss of the sayings of the poor. And there is
one more point—after which the Red Indian, who hasn’t
had any attention for a long time, and was beginning to
presume upon the silence, may be left again for a while—
say, until the 1902 figures come along. The Red Indian
had total funds on Dec. 31st., 1901, amounting on its own
showing to £1,020,710. On its own showing (in fact, it
shows all these things to which allusion has been made)—
it has policies in existence purporting to assure for
£44,594,697. It has thus £1 in hand towards paying
£43 13s. 9d. The A.M.P. had, on the same date, policies
assuring £49,366,565; and its assurance fund was
£17,864,514. It had thus £1 in hand for every £2 15s. 3d.
Put in another way, if the whole of the policy-holders of
the A.M.P. fell down dead to-day, it could pay 7s. 3d. in
the £ ; in similar circumstances, and notwithstanding the
wholesale forfeitures of premiums, the Red Indian could
pay s.|d ! And this draggled concern, with intolerable
bumptiousness, professes to look down on sound assu-
rance concerns, and passes off its miserable show as a new
gospel and a great reform in life assurance.

The January-June half-year is tHe “off” period in this
co.’s affairs ; the wool go°s down, and most of the station
supplies go up, in the other half. In the past six months
there was far less ordinary traffic than usual even for the
“off” period, and if it hadn’t been for the carriage of
returning live stock, the co. could hardly have escaped
a loss. Somebody was asking the other day how
it is that the privately-owned Deniliquin line can make a
profit while the State-owned lines can’t. One reason is
that the private concern isn’t run as a charity. In the
12 months ending June 30, 1901, the co.’s receipts from
the carriage of live stock were £683, equal to 4£ per cent,
of total receipts. In the last 12 months they were £3432,
or 22 per cent, of the total. The co. was very sorry, no
doubt, for the people who had stock and no feed ; but it
charged them freight all the same. The State, on the
other hand, had to show its sorrow by charging no
freight; and so the Railway Department is charged with
what the Charity Department ought to be. Bunching
the last two years of bad seasons together, the average
return has been equal to £5 13s. 9d. per cent, per annum
on the co.’s paid capital (£100,000).

J.M.O. : (1) The Bulletin never refused the
Independent Order of Foresters space to reply in its
columns. It offered the same space that this paper’s
comments on the 1.0. F. had occupied—about a column
of small type. When the 1.0. F. man insisted on filling
about two columns, and said he would have that or
nothing, the negotiation broke off. (2) The 1.0. F. never
even proposed inserting its answer as an advertisement,
therefore there was no refusal. (3) No local office
offered a single copper to get the 1.0.F.’s letters or
advertisements suppressed. Why should, it? When
each of the large offices here manages to get along despite
the competition of eleven other large offices, what differ-
ence is a concern such as the 1.0. F. likely to make to
them ? Even in its own country it amounts to very little
alongside such a concern as the Canada Life, and it isn’t
likely to shake things up very much here E.L. :

At last week’s meeting of the Mutual Store
(Melb.), the chairman, in a pained voice, drew the atten-
tion of shareholders to the item of “ Income Tax, £269 ”
and urged them to protest against the iniquitous levy of
13d. in the £ upon the business profits. Practically he
asked them to believe that the dividend of 5 per cent
might have been much bigger but for that deduction of
£269, and one shareholder apparently did believe it.
Anyway a Mr. Blashki “ held that the Store had done very
well in paying 5 per cent., considering the income tax and
the condition of the city.” Whereupon several old ladies,
of neglected arithmetic, shook their heads and sighed.

so bloated a result as the protected manufacturer always

Mort’s Dock, however, shows a better result
than almost any other Australian manufacturing con-
cern, apart from breweries, noticed in this column during

This last writing-off is to cover depreciation. The capital
now stands at £48,000 ; and on this amount the profit,
after allowing for depreciation, was equal to £4 2s. 6d.
percent., which, considering the severity of the writing-
down, is rather miserable. In proportion to its capital
the co. is weighted with a heavy overdraft, which, with
other debts, amounted on June 30th to £80,765 against
£78,451 twelve months previously. Apparently the-
making of profits only increases the liabilities.

Bendigo’s output for August (25,5420 z.) was,
with one exception, the best for any month since 1876.
S. New Moon is still leading, with 23720 z. ; then Ulster
United, 21500 z. (from 872 tons); New Moon, 1401 oz. ;
Hustlers No. 1,11360 z. ; and Great Northern, lOOloz.
The month’s dividends were £28,728.
* * * *
Bendigo divs. week before last totalled over
£ll,OOO, of which £7200 was paid by S. New Moon and New
Moon cos., the former figuring wiLh its boss div. to date—
£4Boo. Four mines on this line—the Northern continua-
tion of the Garden Gully—paid £10,050. S.N. Moon and
New Moon mines are looking better than ever. A recent
visitor expressed the opinion that there ought not to be
less than 300 stampers at work on the Clarence, S.N.
Moon and New Moon group, but the Bendigonians have
not yet got beyond the idea that there is no reason why
they should do more than “ father” did.

A NEW USE FOR THE BARMAID.
(The Sanitary Communion Service).
A strong protest is being raised against the dangerous and in-
sanitary practice whereby the communicants all drink out of the
same cup. A separate drinking vessel for each communicant is abso-
lutely necessary to prevent the spread of lip cancer and other diseases.
Broken Hill had settled itself into a dull
despair; uncaring, fondly thinking that Fate had
done its worst, and that anything else that could
happen wouldn’t interest it worth tuppence.
But, alas, the worst had yet to come—an intimation
from both the Relief Board-and the S, Australian
Government that they couldn’t supply the
breweries with water any longer. But the woe
in the faces of the inhabitants when this news
came softened the wrath of Heaven, and rain fell.
So the beer was saved.

D.T.’s Saturday article on the “Bacillus
of Laziness” is a good example of Yes-No. It
says :
The lack of capacity for sustaining energy in the Irish-
man—of course only in Ireland —may fairly be referred to
the congenital-government combination, one of the
proofs being that when the Irishman emigrates and comes
under a new environment, his natural tendency towards
inertia is often overcome, and he becomes a power in the
land of his adoption.
And a little further on :
There are good grounds for submitting that in propor-
tion as a Government encourages its people to rely upon
the State for employment, instead of relying upon their
own efforts, that Government, pro tanto, encourages the
habit of national laziness with all its attendant evils.
Irishmen in Ireland do not rely upon the State for
employment. The Telegraph assumes they do,
and therefore are lazy. Irishmen in Australia are
prone to rely on the State. The Telegraph
assumes they are not, and are therefore energetic.
The argument of the article, by the way, is that
State Socialism makes people lazy.
A warning from. Melbourne :
A variant of the “ walking ” craze commenced in Mel-
bourne Sept. Ist, and threatens to eventuate in Sydney
on the 19th. This is the attempt of one A. H. Coppock
to cover the 600 miles between the capitals in 19 days.
Coppock seems to have undertaken the contract partly
to advertise a new patent method of infantry equipment,
designed by himself, and partly to win the usual wager.
Anyhow, he set out from Melbourne Stock Exchange at
11.30 a.m. on the Ist, carrying a rifle, a neatly-strapped
knapsack with a new pair of boots attached, and a good-
sized packet of Squashed Oats or Frayed Corn, or some
patent food of that sort. Tie is understood to be a
vegetarian, teetota gentleman, and to be in the habit of
camping out and walking long distances on little tucker.
Nobody seems to know the size of the alleged wager, or
what will happen to Coppock if he gets a lift; but, if a
footsore person in kharki, with a dilapidated billy and an
empty packet of Sprained Beans, is noticed toiling down
Pitt-street, Sydney, on the morning of Saturday, the
19th, the populace is hereby requested to stand off and
admire.

Waverley (Sydney) cemetery trustees
acted quite rightly in refusing to allow their
field of the dead to be used as a meeting place
for people wishing to orate over the ’9B Irish
rebellion. In the first place, there is no shadow
of reason why the memory of the old rows of the
old world should be kept alive in Australia. In
the second place, anything that tends to discourage
self-advertising posturers from plastering with
their posters the bones of the dead is good.
The ’9B celebration is 10 per cent. Irish
patriotism (and in this country there should
only be room for Australian patriotism), 80 per
cent, notoriety-hunting (and for that there is no
call to make room anywhere), and 10 per cent,
damage to the cemetery premises. In the third
place, the dead deserve a rest.

The Wesleyans and Presbyterians threaten
to unite in Australia. If they do, how will the
combined sect wear its whiskers ? The Wesleyan
monkey shave is a trade - mark. So is the
Presbyterian grizzled beard—the Presbyterian
seems mostly tough and elderly. The best hope
is that the Wesleyans will adopt the Presbyterian
style, for the Wesleyan chin is a sad, lone, de-
nuded hillside that reflects on Art, and kills
Poetry at the first glance.
“ Melb.” : The Bull
and Mouth Hotel,
Bourke-street, is being
rebuilt. Some of its 61d
rivals gave up their
highly valuable licenses
for employment more lu-
crative. John Glee-
land’s Albion bar did
not give up, but retreated
to the basement, while a
music-shop, etc., is on
top. The authorities of
the gigantic Federal
Coffee Palace can never
forgive themselves for
surrendering, on the in-
spiration of J. Minims
and his umbrella, the
license of the little
British Admiral Inn,
which was on their cor-
ner. They say Mirams
now sells milk (as a
punishment V). The Po-
etic Blacksmith, John
Whiteman, M.L.A., and
his wife, Madame Midas,
daughter of contractor
Cornwall, kept the Clar-
ence, on the site which
afterwards did not turn
out a lucky stand for the
Metropolitan Bank. The
Prince of Wales Hotel,
a great squatting re-
sort, used to be in Flinders Lane, a little
east of Swanston-st. Then there was the
famous Criterion, about where the Commer-
cial Bank is. The savory Rainbow has been
replaced by the Temperance and General Life
Insurance Society.

That angry attorney, E. R. Abigail, of
Sydney, was suppressed with great thoroughness
by Stipendiary MacFarlane the other day. When
the attorney refused to be a gooi little boy and
sit down when told, the magistrate had him
deposited outside by two policemen. Abigail
waved his brolly and dared the policemen to lay a
hand on him, but the officers, evidently being of
opinion that Abigail was only dangerous with
his mouth, disregarded the impending brolly and
Abigail left. If Magistrate MacFarlane would
only put his official foot down as heavily on the
dirty, insulting Police Court attorneys who try to
confuse women witnesses by asking them indecent
and irrelevant questions as to their relations with
imaginary men, he would establish a better claim
to a statue than half the statesmen who have been
immortalised in marble and other mineral sub-
stances. No man could have a better epitaph
than “ He made our Police Courts clean.”

An inquest on a patient who died, at
Sunbury (Vic.) Lunatic Asylum, of erysipelas—the

information that the solitary night nurse had
charge of six dormitories containing no less than

Governor Rawson has recommended the
Imperial Government to appoint a schoolmaster
to Norfolk Island. That is roundabout business,
but seems inevitable till the island comes under
the Commonwealth. Hampden appointed Mr,
Arnold, of N.S.W. Public Instruction Depart-
ment, and sent him to the island. The office is a
small, badly-paid one, and subject to sudden local
whirlwinds of abuse. Also, the depressing social
atmosphere makes the schoolmaster grow into an
eccentric being. One master turned Seventh Day
Adventist and refused to teach the Church of
England'-Catechism. Another went over to the
Free Methodists, and so on. Hampden fixed the
salary at £l4O and fees, latter mostly paid in fruit
and vegetables—“garden truck” as the Americans
sometimes put it.

August 25th was the centenary of the first
church (known as “The Wattle and Dab”) in
Australia. It stood about where Tattersall’s
Chambers now are, at the corner of Hunter and
Castlereagh-streets, Sydney, and was built by Par-
son Johnson, at his own expense, cost being
£67 12s. 11 Id. The quaint bill is published in
Bon wick “First Preacher,” and shows how care-
ful the parson was to keep an aoconnt of every
halfpenny expended. The wages were paid in
SDanish dollars, rum, flour and assorted provisions.
When the parson handed his bill to the Acting
Governor —Grose —that military martinet refused
to pay it on the ground that Johnson ought to
provide his own church. The British Government
ordered.the payment of the bill, but the convicts
burned down the edifice on October 1, 1799.

On Eight Hours’ Day in Adelaide the
unemployed paraded at the rear of the procession
of labor societies. They carried an improvised
banner on which was painted a coffin (labelled
“ Public Works ”) and a crossed pick and shovel
instead of the conventional thigh bones. Taken
altogether, the Labor display was the best for
years, but things to eat and drink were its most
prominent features. Butchers, bakers and brewers
constituted the biggest part of the turnout, and a
country has to get far ahead of beef, beer and
public works before its industries are much to
boast of.
There were recently auctioned in Sj r dney
three handsome and costly chandeliers, imported
from England, 50 years ago by Daniel Cooper
for his then residence in Macquarie-street.
They were allowed to remain in their original
cases all these years, till recently discovered by
the trustees in store. Dan Cooper’s house in ■
the fifties was that now adjoining the Colonial
Secretary’s office, opposite Government House
gates. When he took up his residence in
England the house became the home of the Civil
Service Club, of which C. A. Goodchap was
honorary secretary. Then Robert Gray, soft-
goodsman, became a tenant, and made way for
the International Exhibition Commissioners, they
in turnmaking way for the Reform Club, of which
old Jack Robertson was the tin god. When
Robertson died tlie club died also. Then Dan
Cooper’s “ town house ” degenerated fora time
to the usual semi-swell hash house, and is now an
office of the Commonwealth Government.
Gore, one of

that looked

what used to
be a pub. be-
fore the great
drought set in,
and had cap-
tured much

unlawfully at
large. The
news of the raid
spread, and half
the township turned
out; and when the
police set out with the cart-
load of drink to the station, a
sad and sober Gore took off its hat,
and, to the number of 200, fell in and marched
sadly after the hearse. An old friend had been
taken from them, and they mourned for him as
for a brother.

A cat at-home was held recently in Hobart.
It was a very special affair, and the invitations
were sent out on embossed cards to all the first-
family cats in the capital. The Government
* fuse Thomas was brought round by a well-
oiled fiunkey, and things went smoothly enough
until Mr. Havelock started to behave rudely
to a Maltese tabby, of irreproachable ante-
cedents. A shocking scramble ensued. The
spittings and yowlings sounded like another
Mafeking revival, and hair and bristles flew
around profusely. One cat owner received a biff
on the head from a Thomas as large as a calf, and
a ferocious looking she-puss fixed her claws in her
mistress’ back hair. The cause of the trouble was
carried out, yelling profusely, and it is not con-
sidered probable that he will be invited to future
Hobart cat gatherings.

North Sydney Cemetery of St. Thomas,
now likely to be obliterated by the progress of
settlement, has been a home of the dead for nearly
60 years. The site was given by Alexander Beiry,
who owned vast areas around there.
He himself lies buried there, and his
wife was the first person to receive
a grave in the place.
Berry was an

Another bit of old Sydney is about to
come down—-the house in George-street, near
King-street, where, in 1836, Thomas Ware Smart
commenced business as auctioneer, &c. He had
been employed for six years in one of the leading
commercial houses, and “thought it time to com-
inence for himself.” He became manager of the
Sydney Bank, which was a failure, but worked
himself into a fortune eventually. He built the
mansion “Mona” on the Darling Point Road,
where be bad a fine collection of pictures. Asa
politician, lie became Treasurer twice, under
Cowper, and was Secretary for Works under the
same slippery politician. In the next house, in
George-street, another Colonial Treasurer, C. E.
Weekes, carried on an ironmongery business.
That little stretch of George-street, between King
and Hunter streets, supplied N.S.W. at various
times with no less than seven Treasurers.

In putting some grievances in connection
with the administration of the Old Age Pensions
Act before the N.S.W. Treasurer reoently, a
deputation gave some quaint particulars of alleged
red-tapeism arising out of the distribution of the
weekly dole. Alluding to the proof of death
required by the Board, Griffith, M.L.A., stated
that the Lands Department wrote to a woman in
the country, and referred to her husband as “the
deceased.” On the husband indignantly denying
his alleged defunctness, the Department replied
that his unsupported testimony on that point
couldn’t be accepted. Then Hollis, M.L.A., gave
a case of another woman whose husband suddenly
faded away about 1878, and hasn’t been seen or
heard of since. Before the Board will now give
the deserted woman a pension, it requires her to
give definite information of her vanished old
man’s present position, or proof of his demise 1
Regarding the clause in the Act which requires
that a person who has been in receipt of £1 per
week for the year prior to his application must
wait twelve months before the O.A.P. can
be granted, one speaker instanced a case of an
o’d man, formerly in receipt of 30s. per week as a
lift attendant, being discharged and told to apply
for the pension. On applying, however, he
learned that he had to be practically destitute for
12 months before he could get the dole, and how
to live during those 12 months of destitution is a
problem of great dimensions.
Commenting on the fact that the N.S.W.
Railway Commissioners refuse to extend the
penny section of the eastern suburbs trams, the
S.M. Herald says an enterprising omnibus pro-
prietor got over the difficulty by running a penny
’bus. The Bulletin’s opinion of the penny ’bus
is that it needs the interference of a Humane
Society. The institution, as seen in opposition to
the tram system, is a scandal to Australians, who
hitherto have been regarded as being especially
attached to the horse. But the fat dame and the
straw-hatted individual who sit on an over loaded
’bus while the driver flogs mercilessly at his under-
fed team is (thank God!) not a type of the true
Australian. The true type comes from the Snowy
River—and elsewhere.

Melbourne magistrate Panton has an
unhappy knack of advising those brought under
his notice in his beak-like capacity to go into the
country and get work. Recently he ordered a
man who was getting 30s. a week to go into the
country and increase his weekly earnings. If
Panton had a fortnight searching for work, with
liis swag up, an offer of 10s. a week and the
manner in which his first pint of flour would be
handed out to him would break up his theory
about going into the country as a panacea for all
t vils.

The Anglican clergy of Bob-Cab Smith’s
diocese propose to appeal to Bob-Cab Smith to
exclude clergymen with less than twelve months’
looal residence from all appointments worth over
£3OO a year. It is a disgrace to Australia that
such a regulation should be required, but it is
required—very badly. The usual process in the
profession with the gaiters and the amazing joke
of a hat is this: First an English bishop is
imported, it being understood that no Australian
can address the Deity with the proper British
bleat. The English bishop comes here, says
“ haw ” on landing, and tries hard to con-
ceal his pity for those of the inferior
clergy who are mere Australians. And then
he brings out his English friends and hangers-on
to fill the best available billets, and they also say
“ haw ” on landing, and the Deity is, to some
extent, addressed with the correct Oxford bleat in
these parts, which, doubtless, prevents Him feel-
ing lonely. Most of these imported Bishops are
shockingly dull old hacks with unpicturesque
whiskers, and Australia could grow quite as com-
petent prelates locally—but the bleat has to be
considered.
“F.C.” : Anyone ever notice what costly
boots the average larrikin or spieler habitually
wears ? Lately made one of a car-load travel-
ling out towards the Richmond (Melbourne)
pony races. Nearly every man of the
push possessed a face like a broken
battle-axe and a head like a sterile
cannon-ball. They were plainly of
the loafing, spieling, living-any-
how class that pervades Bourke-
street and defaces Nature. Most
wore slouch hats and so-so
clothes, but nine out of ten
had paid—or borrowed—at
least from 15s. to 30s. for
their boots, or had stolen boots
of that value. The only pair
of cheap stand overs (about
7s. 6d. worth) were on the
feet of a counter-jumper work-
ing out that way. Certainly
the hard-faced brigade could
v have found a full week’s work
for a snob —some of the boots were
in the last stages of senile decay—but
they had originally been the choicest
American importations. And the owners
wore the fierce expression of men who were going-
to steal more valuable boots immediately.

This belated letter seems to have arrived
by gradual whaleboat from Norfolk Island :
Writer of par. (8., 6/6/’O3) is off the mark. Governor
Rawson is not the first Governor to visit Norfolk Island
since Robinson in ’74. Islanders have had visits from
Loftus, Carrington, Hampden, and Beauchamp. Also,
Robinson did not reduce the fines men had to pay for
parentage without marriage. Long after his visit men
were fined the same old £lO, and labored on public works
to amount of fine. It was never paid in cash. The
new laws enforced by Colonel Spalding under Governor
Hampden did away with the fine, 2s. 6d. per week for the
mother being the new order. The new arrangement has
not changed the ways of the islanders. At a public
meeting, Chief Magistrate King in the chair, Bishop
Wilson stated that the majority of the births were of
illegitimate children, and not one of the after spiakers
objected to the statement, but all said they thought
“ something should be done.” There are no liquor shops
on the island ;no overcrowded cities; no slums ; and
parsons by the score. Norfolk Island morals should be
above reproach, but they aren't.

N.S.W. Government proposes to deal
with the judicial personages who indulge on the
Bench in, foolish revilings
of the laws they are sup-
posed to respect and ad-
minister, and in other
silly verbal gambolings,
by an Act of Parlia-
ment. Surely that size
hammer is not needed to
kill the insect. A Cabi-
net minute, with pub-
licly expressed censure
of offenders, should
serve well enough. If
an individual Supreme
or District Court Judge
set at defiance the
minute, Parliament could
deal with him separately;
all other judicial persons are
amenable to Cabinet discipline.
To attempt to pass an Act means
to shelve the question. A stern
Cabinet minute could be penned and
passed in an hour, and would be just _
as efficacious, probably, in regard to a Judge s
excursions into politics as a stipendiary magis-
trate’s tolerance of smut and billingsgate.
Justice Denniston, of Maoriland, recently
defined the three stages of love as, “ Walking out,
keeping company, and engaged.” Whereupon a
scoffer wrote to a Christchurch paper to say that
his Honor didn’t know what he was _ talking
about, and defined the three as “Walking out,
lying-in, and the Destitute Persons Act. And
in a good many cases the scoffer is right.

A pen-picture by “ P.” :
Went to Sydney Protestant Hall the other night to see
G. H. Reid crowned with the laurel wreath of splendid
victory by applauding thousands of Australians, fired to
madness at the wrong done them by the Barton Govern-
ment, and intoxicated with their own avenging of that
wrong. I got there ; but didn’t find any enthusiastic thou-
sands—there might have been 300 listless persons. When
the poll was declared someone said, “ Good boy, George ! ”
someone laughed, and two straw-hatted youths on the
kerb said, “hurray” so unexpectedly that a cab-horse
was visibly startled. Then through the lighted window
protruded George—vaguely reminiscent of some enshrined
and corpulent saint seen in a picture book of
childhood—and his drawling voice somehow seemed only
a melancholy monotone, and a long, long way off. No
dash ; no triumphant note—the voice of a disappointed
man. This was the end of it all 1 After all his efforts,
his theatrical resignation, his “largest meetings ever
held,” his press booming, and general riot and fury—
only some 2000 electors had been enthused to voting pitch;
only some3oogatheredtoseetheend of thecomedy. The
situation was bathetic, and George Reid, with all his effron-
tery, felt it so. His vivacity fell from him like a discarded
mantle, leaving him naked and fat and almost ashamed.
His one desperate stroke for redemption, which might
have been finely dramatic with George at his best—his
challenge to Barton for the Maitland seat—was made
with forced enthusiasm, and aroused only a perfunctory
cheer from the audience. So tame and forceless was Reid
that in the unknown candidate who spoke after him
appeared a rugged vitality that stirred one’s pulses as
does the spirited quick-step after the dirge at a military
funeral.

A young Sydney music-teacher who
suicided by inhaling gas left these remarks
behind her:
“ Look after mother, never mind about me. Burn me
up or nail me down, just as you please. Perhaps the
Government would do it. If they will, I will canvass for
them, also get them reserve seats, and also ask a few
cherubs to come down to this delightful place and swell
the population, which is decreasing in such a painful
manner. I will say ‘ good-bye ’ now, and make still one
less on this beautiful planet. It is a great wonder that
anyone should wish to quit it. I expect I shall haunt it
for a while, although I have not had a very pleasant time.
Again, please look after mother, and that’s all.”
The population isn’t decreasing, but all these
anxious newspaper writings about the “declining
birth-rate ” have got on the public’s nerves. Even
unmarried suicides now worry in their last
moments about the birth-rate.

King Ned’s visit to Vienna has a Gilberbian
flavor. At the banquet the British monarch
solemnly created the Austrian Emperor a field
marshal of the British army. Cable states that
Francis Joseph received the honor in silence, but
bent forward and pressed the King’s hand.
Perhaps he was too full for words. In all the
years when the British army bore a good
reputation Francis Joseph wasn’t even made an
honorary corporal. And now, when the ‘ ‘ rag-
ging ” scandals, and the incompetence shown in
S’Africa, and the fact that it has been found
necessary to lower the height standard so as to
admit dwarfs of five feet, have made things
unpleasant, Edward decides that the army has got
down to about his friend’s level. Francis Joseph
comes in as a five-foot recruit, .so to speak. No
wonder the Austrian couldn’t think of any appro-
priate remark.
AS IT SHOULD BE.
The parsons mostly belong to the colored labor
party, and assure us that the coffee-colored person
is an equal and a brother. Yet they never show
t heir faith by picturing heaven as anything like
this.
The charge againsb Coroner Ramsay Smith,
of Adelaide, seems to be principally that he took
a number of skeletons, to which he had no just
claim, and sent them to the Royal College of
Surgeons, at Edinburgh. The taking of the
skeletons seems no great matter, but the sending
of them to Britain, when Australian students are
so much in need of bones to study, seems (if it
were done) a shameful robbery. The fact that
Britain sends us bishops is no excuse ; let Britain
keep the bishops while we retain the bones.
BE CONTENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Said the preacher, “ Be content,
Pay your taxes, pay your rent;
Earthly things you must despise,
Think of mansions in the skies !
Though your back with work is bent,
Be content, man, be content ! ”
Then the preacher onward went
To the man who gets the rent.
Feasting, preacher laughed elate,
For this man has riches great ;
They that earthly things revere
Often meet the preacher here.
Be content, man, be content,
Till your race on earth is spent;
Work and strive, then go and die,
All for mansions in the sky !
Mansions here are very rare—
All may have them in the air.

“ ’Tis better to have loved and lost

An adage old as Pentecost,
The Jewish festival.
’Tis better to have loved and laughed
To drown the sob of pain,
And know that passion’s fiery draught
Has wrecked your hopes again.
Ah, well, these men who speak, perchance,
They know not how to woo !

’Tis better to have loved and lost

for
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, September 8,1903.
My Dear Arint.—
Sydney District Nursing Association is a charity
that sends out trained nurses to attend the sick
poor in their homes, and teach them that sunlight
in a bedroom is not the noxious thing they seem
to think it, and that the baby should not be fed
on bacon, tea, and hot bread. It must be a smart
charity, to judge by the names of the men and
women on the executive committee for the fUe in
its aid, held in State Government House and its
grounds. I commend it to the notice of women
who aspire to be first over the fence in the pursuit
of the Correct Thing.
D.N.A.’s fete was opened by State Governor
Rawson on Friday, and his and Admiral Fan-
shawe s daughter, and the gilded aides and private
secs., and all the people who dine at Government
House, took a hand at keeping shops and carrying
swindling bags. Miss Rawson had worked a
table centre of white satin fenced with chiffon
ramparts, for which there was great competition.
On the Rawson-Fanshawe table was a little water-
color—a view of the Campagna by Yay de Vaya,
the titled priest without a collection-plate, who
is now stopping at State Government House. It
was modestly priced at a guinea.
Best side-show of the fete was the floral go-cart
Sarade, organised by Miss Eadith Walker and
Irs. Arthur Cox. An infant was the fare in each
floral cart, and there was an older child between
the shafts. Lovely youngsters, most of them.
Toddler Fairfax, a blue-eyed, flaxen-haired, pink-
cheeked boy, showed as one of the best articles that
can be credited to the S.M. Herald. The Lachlan
Beaton girl and boy, grandchildren of the late
W. B. Dailey, were pony and fare of a hyacinth-
covered cart. The hoods in most of the baby-carts
had been removed and skeleton-umbrellas, covered
with flowers substituted. The first prize went to
a daffodil-covered carriage. Around the hood of
one cart there was a thick fringe of the narrowest
baby-ribbon, about 6in. deep, and the end of
every ribbon was tasselled with a daffodil bloom.
Imagine the labor! It was a proud hour for the
smart woman with infants at the picturesque ages
of from two to six years, and she stood around,
conscious, holding items of baby’s kit, whilst
nurse walked by the side of the vehicle to keep
the Reginald or Ethel in the shafts on the narrow
carpet road.
A bal masque (French for playing the fool in a
Guy Fawkes visor) is a great study. When a man
gets ambushed in a domino and a mask, and
imagines that his identity is hidden, he is tempted
to get out of the straight and narrow path that
leads from his boarding house to his office, and act
as if he had gas on the brain. A masked and
fancy dress ball, in aid of the Waitara Foundling
Home, was held at Sydney Town Hall last Friday.
The galleries were packed with Superior Persons
(who paid 2s. a head) and who averred, as they
gazed down at the motley, that “they loved to
see that class of person enjoying itself, and besides
it was for a worthy charity.” Whisky must hold
an important place in this sorry scheme of things,
for all the best dresses and best-looking women
were advertisements for this or that fire-water.
Black and White ” whisky was represented
by a gazelle girl wearing a dress of black-
and-white satin decorated with all the brands
and ear-marks of that non-temperance drink.
On her head she, wore a bottle that should
have held an electric spark, but early in
the evening the illumination failed. An in-
teresting item in the passing show was “Coley”
Burke, who sponsors “ Black and White,” chasing
his advertisement to learn why she didn’t carry a
light at her mast-head.
Quite £6OO will be realised by the Cranbrook
fete in aid of the D.N. Association. Am using
the future tense because Mrs. B. R. Wise still has
a lot of pottery, cooking pots, jars, and tea-sets to
dispose of at reasonable prices. Write to her at
Darlinghurst.
Three sisters in dominoes were an admired
trinity, and the Pianola Co. advertised itself with
two negro boy employees, the real Sambo article,
smartly dressed and tied together with wide
white satin ribbon. Mr. Facing-Both-Ways was
an ingenious get-up. He wore a wig combed over
his face and a face on the back of his head, and
his frantic feet toed north and south at one and
the same time. “The .lolly Dogs,” a group of
eight persons wearing dogs’ heads and furry coats,
were most melancholy animals. They couldn’t
bark or gambol worth a dog biscuit. A lately-
returned-from-London singer and writer was an
ace of clubs with a little mask, but his smile
betrayed him, and to his disgust he was addressed
by name. Amongst the crowd in evening dress
was a lady who must have meant to represent
The Naked Truth. It was a beautiful display,
but it was very disconcerting to those who like
Truth with some bodice to her gown. Some one
ought to go to a fancy dress ball as our National
Debt. Many Sydney women could look the part
straight off; one taking the part ought to be
2001bs. in weight and wear the figures £200,000,000
above her shoulder-blades. Hughes, Mayor and
Mayoress, came along ; so did some members of
the Minister of Works family. H. J. Quinlan
and C. G. Hepburn, honorary organising secs, will
hand about £4OO to the charity.
Some cheerful Cherokee distributed hundreds of
leaflets during progress of Waitara charity dance.
These contained a poem by himself, dedicated
without permission, to Mrs. See, and a picture
illustrating same. A young lady with an old-time
Sydney jaw stands waving a “hanky” ataman
who approaches on a bike. In the background
v ictor -Daley sits on a piece of firewood, evidently
m great pain, and drawing what appears to be a
six-inch nail out of his ear. His left hand clutches
a Piece of paper, so perhaps the nail is a pencil,
ana the pain a poem. Several starved chickens
roost on adjacent) fences, and the poem invites you
to desert the madding throng in favor of the
society of gill-birds and magpies.
In Sydney, nowadays, anybody can have a ride
behind the black horses of Heath, for funeral nags
and carnages are let out on hire to the public for
occasions, and you can go to your
wedding and your grave behind the same pair of
neddies. It was probably to advertise the livery
business,, and not the actual undertaking, that a
Sydney firm of coffin-fillers was represented at
Waitara masked ball by a party of eight—four
men, who wore black clothes and tall hats, and
carried white-beribboned whips, and four women
in black and mauve. It was a shuddersome
feature of the evening—dancing for foundlings
with the Heath mutes hovering around.
Talking of fashionable charities: The Homoeo-
pathic Hospital is one without a doubt. State-
Governor Rawson and his family are said to be
amongst those who physic themselves with a wine-
glass of water taken from a five hundred gallon
tank into which has been dropped half a speck of
something out of a small phial. (The great secret
of homoeopathy seems to lie in boiling the tail of a
germ in a train-load of water and calling the
mixture soup.) Sydney Homo Hospital is
acknowledging its subs for the past year, and I
see that Eadith Walker gave £lOO. She has a
hospital of her own to support; all the same .£lOO
is less to the millionairess than is the Rawson
subscription of £5 to the donors.
A friend sends me this letter
. Sydney Telegraph’s tale of the Jennings millions
fizzling out, and soon the news may come
that there are no millions, and possibly that there was
never any Jennings. The latest announcement on the
subject is made by a man at Nowra (N.S.W.), who seems
to be some outlying section of the Jennings clan. He
says that he tracked the estate to its lair long ago, and
found the lair empty and the property not at home.
According to him the estate is not in Chancery at all,
but was divided up among the legal heirs some 60 years
since. Also, it is alleged that owing to a rush of Jen-
ningses, or some such claimants, and the consequent
disturbance and law expenses, all further claimants were
shut out by Act of Parliament, as was done with the
lichborne estates—even if the lost Tichborne baronet
turned up now and proved his identity he not only could
l e l ov % r es tates, but he couldn’t sue for them.
What the Jennings estate amounted to when it existed
doesn’t appear.
The habit of being an unexpected heir to vast
wealth is evidently quite incurable in this country.
On top of the excitement about the “Jennings
millions,’ which Sydney Telegraph writes about
so confidingly, somebody at Parramatta has now
discovered that he is inheritor of a three-fourths
share in a 300-acre property in the heart of
.London. The whole estate is worth .£30,000 000
or thereabouts ; so the Parramatta man is to come
in for £22,500,000, on a rough estimate. Just now
f * remember that anybody died of late and
left £30,000,000 worth of Droperty in London,
but probably the news of the event was crowded
out of the papers to make room for a dog-show
item. These great fortunes appear to be mostly
managed on the irresponsible principles of the
melodrama, where the policeman carries the lost
estate around in his tail-pocket, or the boundless
wealth is left in the kitchen sink till called for.
Hoes any Sydneysider remember a Mdlle. Mag-
deleine Cauchet, a young and pretty Frenchwoman,
who was here, so she says, less than four years
ago as a lecturer and fashionable teacher of
1 rench ? Mdlle. has just enjoyed a little news-
paper boom in Paris, for she has been giving an
account of the world’s tour she undertook without
a sou in her pocket. She gave French lessons,
and lectured and exhibited her extensive Univer-
sity diplomas, and Society hugged her to its
crepe-de-chine breast. Thus she passed through
G-reat Britain, America, South Africa and Aus-
tralia. .In Australia she did not need to advertise
for pupils; they simply rushed in upon her, so
she says. What wonderful things some people
can do without a sou in their pockets ! Not
everyone knows that you can hire halls, advertise,
take long railway journeys, and live at the best
hotels, in a penniless condition.
Edith Yeo, the plaintiff in the breach of pro-
mise suit against young grazier George Fox, is a
small, quiet, somewhat anaemic-looking girl. She
was. on the verge of fainting at least a dozen times
during the course of her evidence. Those who
were in court and heard the trial are delighted
with the verdict. Newspaper reports of the
evidence hardly do the girl justice. Her
refusal to part with her infant told in her favor.
Hefendant vowed fie had no money, “ not a bean,”
and that he had to sell for £250 his interest in his
father’s will to pay the Attorney-General, who
defended him. Fox is a superior-looking sort of
hayseed, with prominent lips; he was a sailor
until lately. Having to find £lBOO will probably
make his mouth assume an extra prominence that
will last all his life.
“ It is fashionable to be dead now, so I ought to
be happy.” Extract from the letter left by a
music-teacher girl who committed suicide last
week. Be fashionable and you’ll be happy, was
perhaps the poor little woman’s creed. But she
neglected to add instructions as to fashion of her
burying robe—whether it should “flare” with a
shaped flounce and be trained or otherwise. She
also entreats “whoever comes in first” (so the
letter begins) “to look after mother.” In her
own case “ looking after mother ” meant keeping
on at music-teaching, and the teacher died in
preference. I suppose it is better to die than to
teach music but judging by Ethel Cavanagh’s full
letter she had been reading cheap romances.
State Governor Rawson has been visiting Bee-
croft to open a “village” fete. Beecroft is a
truly rural spot 12 miles from the city, and there
the bee sucks and the wild thyme grows, and the
gentle lark soars from his dew> nest, and the dan-
delions are bigger than elsewhere. It is full of
orchards, and bee - farms, and persons whose
parents and grandparents came from “villages”
and who haven’t yet outgrown the use of the
word. But it charmed Captain Share, the State
Lx. s private secretary, so much that he would
not object to a permanent lair at Beecroft.
Once upon a time,. some few years ago, a lady
with money and social aspirations but no social
sponsors came to Sydney from Possum Flat and
made several attempts to become one of the set
that has learned to say “ haw.” But the set gave
Berthe non possumus shoulder, which is corpse-
cold. So she halted awhile and watched Things
with the result that she got on to the committee of
a fashionable charity and paid liberally for doing
all the work and giving the other women all the
credit. Now she is in England, and her children
are learning to say “haw” right in the great
“ haw ” factory itself, and Australian Somebodies
visiting London are grateful if they receive a card
for one of her “ At Homes.”
Sydney Society is waiting hungrily for the
announcement of two matrimonial engagements.
At present it is not quite certain. One engage-
ment is connected with vice-regal circles ; the
other is that of a richly-left youth in the brewery
line and a mercantile heiress.
An Australian wedding at Pretoria, Transvaal,
took place last April. Bridegroom was Mr.
Francis R. Hays, of Townsville (N.Q.), and bride
Miss Rose Dean, of Coogee. G-iver-away of bride
was Mr. Hillier-Tapp, of Sydney. Amongst
those present was a Mrs. Simpsonne. My ! Isn’t
that a high holiday way to spell a very work-a-
day name ? Smith spelt “ Pjsmythee” now has a
mate.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“The increase of Golfing-fever has no better
criterion than the league-long list of entries for
Sandringham this week. Some hundreds are
pledged to play champions from other States and
from all the crack links of the country.
“ A characteristic of the teeming country
throngs ‘ Showing ’ last week was defective teeth.
Scarcely a rural face broke into a laugh but there
was a shock to the onlooker’s aesthetic system, by
reason of the molar ruin presented, or the crude
dental fixtures depending like monuments from
the jaw. The townie’s teeth are a well-attended
matter, hence the thriving of the Collins-street
dentists, but our country cousins leave the matter
m the hands of a neglectful Providence or a local
stump-dealer.
“Wandering feminines found two exhibits to
grip their tired attention in the vast Flemington
show this year. One was a garden hat made from
the sheath of a Queensland pine-tree flower, and
the other a tall flower-basket amazingly wrought
out of Romsey butter by a lady resident of the
district. The hat was labelled, “ Been in use for
18 months.” It was light and satiny—rather
nicer than the Panama. The butter-basket was a
perfect structure. Its dahlias, roses and violets
were realistic in form, and the basket itself plaited
like the favorite china design.
‘[Aide Browning didn’t have to remain in
splints and plaster for very long. He made a
rapid recovery just as the sympathetic Tooraki-
ennes were devising sick-room comforts, and on
Wednesday he limped to the Show. At the same
time a very sick-looking brother of the Y.R.
staff, Private Secretary Fitzpatrick, strolled
through the kiosks and the tents of the prize
poultry and poodles on his own. Also, squeezing
a way through the general jam, were the Cliveden
dowager, Miss Hilda Cumming, massive Mrs.
Bowes Kelly, Mrs. V. Manifold, and dozens more
of ‘ the best and brightest ’ in squatteratic cirdes.
Lady Tennyson having found a navy-blue costume
and a cake-tin toque with cowslip clusters at the
brim that suits her well, she now uses no other—
like the man in the soap advertisement. At
three of the week’s crushes she has sported the
marine-hued turn-out.
“ The rural population doesn’t take any pride in
Vice-Regal display. This was particularly notice-
able at the agricultural show when the flashing
out-riders, military guard, and grand carriage
arrived on the scene. Ben and Betty gave a grin,
a jerk of the thumb that meant a heap of things,
and proceeded to inspect the prize swine or the
model Ayrshires. At the departure of the greater
Exes on Wednesday and Thursday a handful of
loyal and dutiful citizens endeavored to raise a
cheer, but the M'Carthy rain-raising in Broken
Hill was not a more dismal failure.
“An odd pair taking a momentous interest in
the Show, one of the days, consisted of dapper
Ernest Collins and Miss Susie Vaughan—the
comedy star. Theatricals, as a rule, abhor the
noisy, smelly jostle of the yearly agricultural
event at Flemington. The man who dots take
a rollicking delight in the babel and the general
hustle is the padre. Every day you butt into the
ruddy clerics, their vests bulging, their watch
chains straining over the wide cloth area, generally
in the circle of the bhoys of 1 the parish.
“The Agricultural Show reminds me of an
idealist, who left a desk for farm-work because he
wanted to ‘get near to Nature’s heart and look
into the clear eyes of the sons of the soil.’ He
soon came back to town, and when his friends
asked, ‘ What price the’ sons of the soil ? ’ he
answered, ‘ The brutes all have indigestion.’ The
Jumpers Plate ’ was seen by the Tennysons with
preoccupied eyes straying to the Daffodil Parade,
where their Exes, were next to do a ‘ turn.’ The
competitors for the Plate acted just like humans.
Old Domino, the grey winner, behaved like a
brainy ancient from the start. They showed him
all the jfimps beforehand, and the old chap (1)
scanned, (2) smelt, (3) tasted, every fence and wall
to be negotiated. Second prize was won by a
coquettish chestnut mare, Lady Hampden by
name. Just like a woman ; a good second is the
best she can hope for !
A daughter of alleged Senator Reid figured as
the driver of one of the trimmest trotters in the
show ring last week, and won points for whipman-
ship all along the line. All the Reid daughters
are skilful with the reins. One comely member
of the family has even gone in for veterinary
practice, can shoe, plaster and physic her nags,
and is dexterous in all branches of horse business.
“ The peeping Toms of the community are being
catered for by a villainous invention of glass and
steel, so contrived as to fit any door-lock aperture,
and designed to bring to the eye the focus of the
whole room. Place your patent investigator at
the keyhole and you sight all that is going on
within. The mischievous thing was exhibited by
a public enemy at the Show last week, and the
sale for it was enormous—mostly among country
people. In the city you can hang a towel over
the keyhole and end the thing 1 . The country
house has generally large cracks in the wall.
“Since the passenger traffic between the Big
Smoke and these unfriendly States has grown so
brisk the enterprising woman starts all kinds of
businesses to catch tourists coming and going.
The Australian Tea Rooms are the latest London
rendezvous. The Australian is apt to feel lone-
some in London, and it is expected that he
will rush to the Tea Room under the sign of
the Wattle and the ’Roo to see if there is a smell
pf eucalyptus there and a fellow Australian. And
if he doesn’t- meet the real fellow-Australian he
may meet the bogus, one, who will assure him that
he also lias frequently seen the kangaroo bounding
g OWl ’ Collins-street, Brisbane, and up Pitt-street,
”°pk us^ra^la > ar) d will try to get him to change
a ho note on the bank where the wild thyme
grows. • J
Society girds up its chiffon strength for a
great October knot-tying, when Surgeon Thomas
Fitzgerald’s eldest daughter, with the Irish grey
eyes and the soft voice, faces the matrimonial
rails in company with Commander Lumsden, of
the Royal Arthur.
“The Lonsdales, Countess and Earl, were in
tow of the evergreen and exuberant Frank
Stuart, softgoodsman, most of their time here.
In fact the Tennysons and this boon companion
shared hostly honors in the case of the dis. vis.
(meaning distinguished visitors). Seems that a
friendship arose between Mr. Stuart and the
Jjonsdales in Japan. They were fellow-passengers
to Sydney.
“Nellie Stewart skipped about town a lot in
brief skirts before she left Melbourne. Her pro-
jecting hips gave the skirt too brief a look to be
suitable, but Nellie’s shoes were things of beauty
and her arched instep a joy for ever. Men in the
street forget that the foot displayed in the
Orange Nell rdle didn’t arch at all. The actress is
much more given to cheering the street with her
well-shod feet and her begemmed hands than with
her inscrutable face. Her drooping hat is regarded
nowadays as an artistic speciality. •
“ Towards the close of the Villon drama Cuy-
ler Hastings was playing with a tired air. His
make-up was careless, so that, under the illumina-
tion of the limes, his High Constableship wore a
haggard aspect. Miss Lane also died differently
after the first night or two. She took a garden
seat for the uttering of her swan notes. But the
flunkeys still dragged her corpse out with its heels
rasping along the boards.
“ The grey-black groveller in the Royal drama
had a habit of making the sign of the cross with
the left hand—a bit of bad business in the eyes of
the R.C. Even most ‘outsiders’ knew enough to
see that this was wrong. King Atholwood never fell
into this error, and his unostentatious holy water
sprinklings were wonderfully natural. The male
R.C. always dips his paw into the font in a quiet,
sheepish fashion that splashes no neighbor.
“Julius Knight will not be too much troubled
by the adulation and overtures of romantic young
things as long as he keeps gravitating on this side
of the footlights. It is a Julius of greater years,
with greying tendencies, of coarser features, with
tell-tale traces of hard work in his strong eyes and
the etchings about his lips. And always he acts.
Maud Jeffries is, on the other hand, lovelier, if
anything; calmer, splendid in her dress, and
quite the grand duchess in her manner.
“News has arrived of the engagement of Mr.
Nick Fitzgerald’s warrior son to Lady Constance
McKenzie—a lady of high degree, with Countesses
galore on the family roll-call. The big brewer’s
family has a talent for marrying blue blood. The
eldest son, a graduate of Dublin University,
is mated to Lord North’s daughter and moves In
a creamy London circle where the R.C.’s largely
predominate. The McKenzie family is also R.C.
The third son, Ned, is Melbourne’s leading
bachelor and holds his head high. More, he is
considered the ‘ killer ’ of the family, so a duchess
may be expected to fall to his matrimonial lot —if
the Fates continue smiling. And his father still
keeps the brewery.
“At the Huuane Society’s evening, Lady
Tennyson, handing over the certificates and
pinning-on the medals, did her part with smileless
stiffness. Now, the Countess of Hopetoun, social
ice-cream though she was, was wont to shine as
a hero-worshipper, and when presenting the
‘Humane awards’ greeted each blushing brave
with quiet earnestness and an appreciative flash
of her usually inscrutable eyes. J. Elder, of Port
Melbourne, having twice saved life since last
distribution, drifted forward for his awards
with the loose-jointed gait of one far
gone in abject nervousness, deprecatingly
crooking his left knee by way of salute
to Lady Tennyson. One of his achievements, the
rescue of a drunken sailor from the waters of the
Bay on a dark and dirty night, involved this man
of mettle in the double peril of drowning and being
drawn under by the steamer’s propeller. A small
boy, who came for his certificate in clothes several
sizes too large for him, had been fishing from the
pier for bits of floating wood for the family fire
when a human derelict swept past with other
flotsam and jetsam. The kid became a fisher of
men, and saved his life. Only two of the prize-
takers accepted their honors with outward
calmness. One of these, an elderly police-
sergeant, walked the platform and stood to
attention like grave discipline incarnate. On
the day he won his medal, however, he had hurled
himself down a steep bank and taken to the water,
as if he were youth and impetuosity personified,
at the cry of beauty in distress. The other com-
posed member of the ‘ valiant crew 7 ’ was a
charming heroine of 23, Miss Queenie Wood, of
Hawthorn (Melb.), who had saved a woman and
two girls from drowning. Rather cruel, by the
way, the society’s habit of publishing everyone’s
age ! Perhaps the rescuers, haloed with glory,
can laugh at old Time, but what about the rescued?
Bad enough to be half-drow 7 ned or burnt brown,
without sending a bellman round, so to speak, to
show one up as 39, say.
“On the Humane platform, the toilettes and
attitudes of the Dowager Clarke, Mrs. John For-
rest, and Bishopess Clarke, respectively, sug-
gested the Big Bear, the Middling-sized Bear,
and the Little Bear. ‘Big,’ nowadays, means
costly a,nd important, like the Cliveden widow’s
impressive black robe, coiled cunningly round
owner’s feet as she sat. Dame Forrest’s black
skirt was more utilitarian, but a glance at the
spot where the Dowager’s trilbies should have
been taught the Westralienne to veil her shoe-
leather with less or more success. Pleasant-faced
little Mrs. Clarke, in grey frock and cream lace,
showed her boot-soles to the audience as confid-
ingly as if all the world were one big, uncritical

A Grand Medicine.
“What a horrible thing St. Vitus’ Dance is ! ” exclaimed Miss Viola Dawson, 4 Willoughby-street, Milson’s Point, N. Sydney.
“Four years ago the weak state of my nerves kept me from going to school. I would tremble and shake all over, and at last St.
Vitus’ Dance came on. Wherever I went I thought I could see horrible black faces looking at me. The least sound made me jump,
and I couldn’t keep my hands or face still for a minute. I had to force myself to eat and fell away to a shadow. I was almost too
weak to walk lam sure I had not a pint of good, pure, warm blood in my body. I couldn’t take part in any play like the
rrirls because my nerves were always working and twitching. I tried almost everything you could think of to stop the horrible
disease but I didn’t get a bit better. A lady hearing how ill I was told me that she read how good Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills were in
all nervous troubles, and she brought me a clipping of a case in which a young girl had suffered like I was suffering, and these pills
had cured her. I tried them and the very first box made my nerves steadier. Soon I ate heartily, and a splendid healthy color came
in my cheeks. Three boxes took away all the jumping and twitching. Now my health is capital and I never get frightened or
nervous. There’s no doubt about it, but Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are really a
grand medicine.”
By this simple and direct action on the blood, and by bracing the nerves, Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills cure Anssmia, Headaches, Neuralgia, Sciatica, Lumbago, Back-
ache, Kidney and Liver Troubles and skin diseases like Pimples and Eczema.

The Senate has wisely changed the name
of a Tasmanian electoral division from Northcote
to Bass. The Commonwealth should treasure
every atom of its old heroic tradition, and there’s
no man more worthy of being commemorated than
explorer Bass.
A Sydney rag and bottle collector carries

W. H. J. Slee, retired at the end of
August from the chief-inspectorship of N.S.W.
mines, had held office under 24 Ministers. Of

R. E. O’Connor has been 27 years at the
Bar. Sixteen years ago (1887) Parkes appointed
him to the N.S.W. Upper House, and he stayed

a representative of the people has been in the
Senate, and he leaves that this session.

beastly democrat, Attorney-General Wise. No

B. R. Wise, and he is now credited with aspiring

“ J.A.C.” on billiardists :
Mr. “Bill’’Lyons, winner of Tattersall’s billiard tour-
nament, is a left-handed player. I first knew him 25
years ago in Auckland (M.L.), and he could handle the
cue with the best of them then. He had at that time, in
company with a partner, “ Bob ” Blaikie, a boot and shoe
business. They, seemingly, found bookmaking a more
lucrative enterprise than boots, and soon devoted their
whole attention to it. Amid the bookmakers exodus
which ensued on the introduction of the tote, they botn
shifted to Australia. Blaikie subsequently went back,
hut “ Bill ” remained to gladden the Commonwealth. Re
left-handed billiardists. I knew one, in Glasgow, away
back in the ’6o‘s—a certain James Meany, who claimed to
he champion of Ireland, and who, for a left-hander, was
certainly one of the world’s best players a 200-and-over-
break man. He could not strike a hall with his right
band. I have frequently known him to get a game on
with some “ sawney ” by offerm'' in addition to points,
to “ play ye wid me lift hand !’’
The story goes in Melbourne that Hop-

The late Dean O’Hea, of Melbourne,
prided himself considerably on his good old Irish
ancestors and ancestresses, and their historical
capacity for making good old bones. His grand-
father, who died at 85, left a mother to mourn
his loss. She had been a Miss De Lacey,
descendant of the De Laceys, who figure in Irish
history among the heroic defenders of Limerick
against William of the “Glorious Memory,” and
the family pluck kept her going to the age
of 115, it is said. Monsignor the Dean didn’t
get near to his great-grandmother’s record,
but he struggled on to 89J, taking his whisky like
a warrior until he grew infirm. Much nonsense
was written and talked about the genial old
veteran —his successful speculations, his “card-
playing,” and his alleged riotous jollity. As a
matter of fact, he never played cards, and his
reputed wealth was mostly a myth.
An old Sydney press-
mam supplies this story.
If it is a lie it is a remark-
ably good lie :
Probably one of the most
awful pieces of profanity that
ever sullied a N.S.W. temple
Of justice occurred in a Sydney
court, and before Justice Win-
deyer, too. Two men were
charged with robbery from a
store, and one of the articles
taken, a violin, was produced
in court. Counsel for the de-
fence endeavored to show that
the article was a paltry affair
not worth £2. The owner
swore it was worth £2O. De-
fendant’s counsel picked up
the violin and coolly said : “ I
am a violinist myself, and I’ll
soon convince the court by the
poor tone of this instrument
that it is not worth a tenth of
that sum.” And before any-
one knew what would happen
next, he tucked the thing
under his chin and played a
few bars of “Home, Sweet
Home,” or what he intended
for that ancient air. Everyone
stood aghast, waiting to hear
the awful lion on the bench
fall upon that barrister and
rend him asunder, but even
the dread Judge seemed para-
lysed. The lawyer cheerfully
observed, “That was an an-
dante movement, your Honor.
Now I’ll show how ill-suited
this instrument is for an allegro ”- ' Put
that wretched thing down!” thundered Windeyer.
“ Put it down at once, or I’ll prevent you from ever
appearing in this court again! ” And no one was
astonished when the sentence was made seven years.
Recently retired Victorian Under-Secre-
tary for Lands, T. F. Morkham, was a beautiful
instance of the Chinese system of managing the
Victorian public service. After holding for 14
years a leading position in the Public Works
Department, where he thoroughly understood the
duties, he was transferred by seniority to the
Lands, to deal with matters he knew nothing
about. And Victoria would have sent him just
as cheerfully to look after engineering matters,
geology, statistics or lighthouses if the seniority
fetish had so required,
A. N. Barnett, appointed Royal Com-
missioner to inquire into the allegations of brutal
treatment in certain N.S.W. lunatic asylums and
old-peoples’ “homes,” is a good sample of the
pushing civil servant. First in the Lands Dept.,
then in the Mines as warden, then in the Justice,
he battled all the time in the baekblocks, and
while still on the good side of 40 was sent to
Albury to replace “ Rolf Boldrewood ” when that
pleasant old yarn-spinner gave over fining the
local resident ss. for letting his cow wander.
From there Barnett got down to the city police-
court bench within the last year or two.

It looks as though Sydney Town Clerk
Nesbitt would be harried into resigning. Alder-
manic nature, in spite of recent “ reform,” is still
mostly hog, and ability generally has the sort of
nerves that are not fitted to deal with hog. Also,
an enthusiast who wants to do good work wearies of
being blocked at every turn by the necessity of
employing aldermen’s incompetent friends at twice
what they are worth. For years all manner of
fools urged as the remedy for everything : “Get
a good man from England.” What is wanted is a
complete new municipal law.
Governor Le Hunte brought off a good

Council and meeting of a Girls’ Club, a hunt
meeting, a football match, a private view of some
very moderate pictures, a lecture, an organ
recital, more racing, and other things—l 3 in all.

ever had, and now an ungrateful public is be-
ginning to suggest that he is too ready to go to
anything for which an invitation is sent.
Kalgoorlie (W.A.) possesses a rival to
“Blind Tom” of Tasmania in Charles Paul,

several years ago, and besides keepinr a
family accumulated £l2O, which he spo t

the present time he is trying to get
another £lOO together to get to the Lou-
don Eye and Ear Hospital. He is an
enthusiastic gardener, and can graft and
prune small trees. He has just finished
the construction of a house that would
do credit to a tradesman.
“Doxo”: South Australia’s Judge
Boucaut the Grim is an omnivorous
reader, and when not on the Bench is
poring over a book—any book, from a
law treatise to a Deadwood Dick shocker.
Saw one of his lists for a month’s reading
—an order on a bookseller. No branch
of literature was forgotten ; there were
histories, biographies, novels poor, bad
and indifferent, law-books, penny-dread-
fuls, and works of science. Boucaut is
practically a reclamation job, and the
amount of mental filling in he requires
before he is fully reclaimed is enormous.
“ Melb ” : In Bourke-street, only
the other day, I was introduced to
Cabbage-Tree Ned, as it were the Last
of the Mohicans, from Cobb’s yore-time coach
drivers. Not a Bohemian in any way, but a per-
fectly quiet citizen. The romance has yet to be
written of Cobb’s coaches. Two good racehorses,
one of which was Inkerman, came out of Cobb’s
traces. For a contrast, I have seen a whilom
smart hurdle-racer in the shafts of a Melbourne
cab.
The “father” of the N.S.W. Legislative
Council is James Norton, solicitor, born in
December, 1824, in Sydney, on the spot where
Temple Court now stands, and in the house
known at one time as the Three Tuns Tavern,
and kept by Richard Driver, senr. The house
had been the private residence of Mr. Norton’s
father in the twenties. Mr. Norton was appointed
to the L.C. in October, 1879. His runner up is
Philip Gidley King, born at Parramatta in 1817,
and appointed to the Council December, 1880.

Concerning one of Phil May’s old models :
Brophy was his name, an ex-Anglican minister. Exiled
from the ministry and dreadfully down on his luck,
Brophy to the last managed to rig himself out in “ third
editions” of old-fashioned clerical clothes—a sort of
ecclesiastical scarecrow in bad circumstances. Brophy
applied to May for charity, and the artist, much to the
old man’s delight, gave him a shilling and a “retaining
fee ”of half-a-crown a week to sit as a model. This really
meant that for nearly three years the old broken-down
parson, who had something of the look and stoop of John
Henry Newman, was one of Phil May’s pensioners. When-
ever he “sat” Brophy, in addition to the “half-crown
regular,” got his dinner and tea at May’s. One day the
80-years-old model asked May to give him some lessons in
drawing. The joke-loving artist consented, on the
understanding that Brophy was to leave May his skeleton
when he died. A contract to this effect was written by
May and solemnly signed by Brophy. Brophy, who could
not be induced to draw anything save girls’ faces and
ladies of the ballet, continued to receive his lessons and
his half-crown, up to the week of May’s departure from
Sydney. The artist parted with his venerable model in
the most comical manner. “You’ve played me a dirty
trick,” said May, “ by swindling me out of that skeleton.
I could have bought one, in sound order and condition,
for half the money you’ve cost me.” The old fellow, con-
scious of his base ingratitude to his best and most patient
friend, answered, “ Don’t be angry with me, Mr. May.
It’s not my fault. I meant to keep my word. Stay in
Sydney a few months longer, and give me another chance
to show you that I am a man of honor."

Six more unhappy young men have been
admitted as solicitors in N.S.W. ; and three-
quarters of those already on the rolls are not able

solicitor in N.S.W., nowadays, reckons his fortune
as made if he is given £lOO to “invest ” by some
money-lending client, and the usurers find in the
unemployed solicitor their most unscru] ulous tool.

Some Papuan notes :
In Papua even the natives do not escape malarial fever.
As a cure they lie on the ground exposed to the direct
rays of a fierce sun for a few hours. Coastal natives
build a small fire on the beach, and, scraping the embers
aside, curl themselves up on the hot sand. In both cases
a profuse perspiration soon results, after which con-
valescence is rapid. The forehead is gashed with a shell
in order to relieve the headache which accompanies fever.
Civilised natives generally use quinine.
To catch a python alive. The chance is seized when
the snake is suspended by only a few coils from the limb
Of a tree. Advancing cautiously with a forked stick, one
of the hunters pins the neck of the reptile to the tree-
trunk. The suddenness of the attack causes the snake
to fall writhing on the ground, where its body isinstantly
pinned down with other forked sticks by the other
members of the party. The python is then with difficulty
straightened, a long stout pole is pushed into the space
between the sticks and the captive, the whole length of
which is securely lashed to the pole with strong vines.
Then the forks are lifted, and, amidst great rejoicing, the
python, unable to move a muscle, is carried shoulder-
high to the village and slain When cooked, the white
flesh is considered a delicacy.
Amongst the Papuans, if water dashed in a swooning
person’s face has no effect, a lighted fire-stick is applied
to the big toe of the left foot. In a few seconds the
patient’s leg-muscle begins to twitch, and consciousness
quickly follows.
Matches generally accompany the presence of white
men, and the civilized Papuan seldom troubles about
making a fire in his former barbaric manner. Upon
necessity, however, a dry piece of bamboo is split in two,
and, with the aid of some creeper, one portion is formed
into a bow, while the other is placed beneath it in the
position of an arrow ready for flight. Friction is then
obtained by rubbing the bow against the “arrow,” and
sparks soon result. Another method is to place on the
ground a dry branch of the madavi-tree, and holding in
the hand, as one would a pencil, a smaller and roughly-
pointed piece of the same wood, to move it rapidly to and
fro on the surface of the stationary limb. To obtain
greater pressure one hand is pressed on top of the other,
and very soon fine charcoal appears at the end of a
narrow indentation in the wood, which gradually smokes,
and finally glows, when blown.
One Papuan method of catching fish is to spread a
small net over a mushroom-shaped growth of coral in
shallow water. A prepared root of poisonous nature,
attached to the end of a stick, is then thrust under the
shelving roof and vigorously stirred about, which causes
the water to become milky white. Fish lurking beneath
the coral, being unable to escape from the poisoned
water, succumb and float to the surface when the net is
lifted. In districts where there’s no coral, large trian-
gular nets with wooden arms and a cross piece are utilised.
Each native has one, and when a shoal of fish is sighted
from the beach a crowd of natives divides into two
parties, which, cautiously wading in neck-deep, gradually
join forces, and forming into a semi-circle, drive the prey
shoreward, where at a favorable opportunity the spoil is
excitedly scooped up. Nets of enormous size, on the float
and sinker principle, are also used, and circular cane-
traps, tapering to a point, are found very effective.
When a Papuan fop is going to visit the lady of his
choice his toilet preparations are more elaborate than
those of an up-to-date Johnnie. First he gets a friend
to shave his face with a piece of obsidian (volcanic glass);
after which, his enormous mop of lime-bleached frizzy
hair, previously deluged in cocoanut-oil, is carefully
combed and trimmed. If available, a mirror is then re-
quisitioned, and he observes with gratification that not a
single hair can be perceived on the reflected face. Even
the eyebrows have been shorn. Giving a grin, he ex-
poses to view a regular set of brown-stained teeth ; but,
with a sigh, he notes that a deal more betel-nut chewing
will be necessary before the once white ivories assume
the jet-black color of manhood. A few curves and off-
sets are designed on his face, as a representation of the
moon. Next his whole body is coated with cocoanut-oi'
untd ** ghstens. Finally, he takes unto himself a newly-
kabatn (loin-covering)—and his toilet is corn-

“ Chass ” ; Once saw two large eagles
trying to capture a hare on the open plains, and
the struggle was an interesting display of intelli-
gence. The eagles at first started to swoop down
on the running hare simultaneously, but when the
birds were within about a yard of him, the hare
would stop suddenly and dart away at right
angles, and the eagles, unable to stop, would
swoop yards ahead. Meanwhile the hare made
good use of the time by keeping on full steam for
a distant hedge. As soon as the eagles got near
enough for a second swoop the hare slackened
speed and evaded them as before. Then the
eagles divided their attentions and darted at him
separately, but the hare timed them splendidly,
and in the end he got under cover, leaving two
empty and disgusted birds speaking evil to each
other out on the plain.

to become converted was old Te Roti. Now Te
Roti, in addition to his proper wife, had a slave-
wife that he had captured from some other tribe.
The missionary told the chief that he would have
to put away the latter, as he could not be a true
Christian and keep two. The missionary was
away at some other station for a few weeks, and
when he returned Te Roti met him, and smilingly
told him that the little difficulty about the two
wives had been fixed up. “ What have you done
with Rata ? ” said the missionary, referring to the
slave-wife. “ Oh,” said the chief, “leather last
week! ”
“Cecil P.” : Be tree-limbs growing
together (8., 20/6/’O3). There was, and probably
still is, a remarkable in-
stance of arboreal Siamese
twins to be seen in the
garden of a very old river-
side inn at Caerleon, above
Monmouth(England). Two
trqps are connected by a
bar-like bough. Impos-
sible to tell from which
tree growth began; it
grows in the usual manner
from each, and is destitute
of twigs or leaves. Forget
what trees they were.

A great deal of foolish
row is made by N.S.W.
country residents in their
demand for free river fer-
ries. A ferry, they say,
is only a floating bridge,
and when the lucky dis-
trict which gets a bridge
pays nothing, the unlucky
one which has to put up
with a beastly punt should
also pay nothing—or even
less. Which is putting|the
cart of theory before the
horse of common sense.
The people who use the
bridge ought to be charged
a toll just as much as the
people who use the punt,
but it wouldn’t pay to keep
a man on the bridge solely
to collect the occasional
copper, while the man has
to be at the punt in any
case. If the bridge is a bad
debt that is no reason why the punt should be
made one also.

“ Bobrid ” : Artifical feeding lias made
sheep so cunning that they will follow the track
of a pollard-distributor and pick up the poisoned
baits. Consequently, these clever j.urnbucks have
to be removed when pollard is laid, and before
they are brought back to the paddock the uneaten
baits must be picked up—a “pet” of a job!
Fancy tramping miles of twisting trails with your
eyes glued on the ground in search of a small
pellet of phosphorised pollard ! As this duty
generally falls to the driver of the distributor, in
his “spare time,” he has sense enough to “cut
off ” the pollard supply soon after starting. Then
the picking-up job is all right, provided there’s
a shady kurrajong tree in the paddock and the
ants are not too lively. The boss sees the tracks
of the machine, so he’s satisfied.

“ Dross ” : Camped once in Thornton
(Yic.) with an old resident, and noticed a lot of
sticks sto Bft long lying around the hut. Asked
my host if he was drying them for whip-handles,
and he told me he had killed five snakes in last
two months, and so had laid a few sticks about to
be handy when his “snake-alarm-clock” called
him. Next morning early I heard a hen making
a terrific noise, and on rushing out found her
standing in middle of road with wings spread,
about five yards from big brown sna re. My host
told me she never failed to let him know if a
snake was about.

“Stan. P.” : Generally understood that if
a horse breaks a limb it is a “gone coon”; but I
have found that if the break is in a place that will
permit of splints being effectively placed, the leg
will knit much quicker than a human being’s.
Had a mare that fractured a pastern, and I did
not even treat it. The beast was turned into a
grass paddock, and after a couple of months was
brought in, blistered with ointment to reduce the
swelling caused by the knitting, and now shows
no sign of the accident. Many horses are, through
ignorance, hurried into an unnecessary grave.
ON THE HILLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With tightened chains
And hot heads snatching
At slackened reins;
With quick breath catching,
The good teams climb the stubborn hills,
The grim, sardonic, scornful hills.
Ah, God ! their hearts break on the hills,
And yet my blood leaps, watching.
The strong hoofs slip
On mud and boulder,
The muscles grip
On flank and shoulder,
And proudly do they rush the hills—
The everlasting, sullen hills.
But every time they top the hills
Their hot, young blood beats colder.
The whips fall light
On sweat-stained quarter.
They wrench and fight
With breath heaved shorter.
They are the conquerors of the hills—
The finest horseflesh on the hills.
Ah ! they will die here on the hills ;
Their veins run blood, not water.
Why must they strain
With dead loads dragging,
With irksome rein
And stout hearts flagging ?
Look, for your answer, to the hills -
The cruel hills, the heavy hills.
Ah ! every time they climb the hills
I see an old horse lagging.
We shout their names ;
They toss the snaffle
And strain the hames,
And spurn the gravel.
They are the conquerors of the hills—
The finest blood on all the hills—
And they will die here on the hills,
When they’re too worn to travel.

AT SUNDOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The bush is leaning like a tired child
Her dear, dark head upon the breast of night;
One star is lone and cold above the height;
The call of cities turbulent and wild
Is with me like the sound of far-off fight.
The hot sky flames above the bush-line dim ;
Beyond the ratas where the red sun dips
Are gleaming bays and galaxies of ships.
My life is bounded by the forest rim—
The cities call me with a million lips !
The bush leans o’er me, and her tresses, long,
Sweet-scented, dark, are trailing on my breast
That craves the strife, the trial and the test,
The burning impulse and endeavor strong—
To fail or win—to stand among the rest!
The night is coming, and the shadows trail
Like wasted lives across the forest belt;
Above the sky-line is a crimson veldt
With dim, heroic forms that strive and fail,
And other faces rise and fade and melt,
That sank to greatness for a fallen name.
I seem to hear the tumult and the din
Of that wide vortex that draws all things in
About its circle towards the crest of fame ;
Some rise to failure, and some stoop to win.
The upward shadow of the broad earth meets
The sky-line, gleaming like life’s golden rim—
All dark beneath but bubbles at the brim.
My heart is throbbing for the roar of streets !
The cloister of the bush is screened and dim.

“ Thaker ” :
No doubt the
cow, frequently
mentioned in
The Bulletin as
a thankless ob-
ject, does her
level best in the
way of ingrati-
tude and general
cussedness, but
nature has im-
posed limitations
which prevent
her from getting
into the same
class with the
eternally ac-
cursed ant. The
cow, for instance,
can’t crawl up
inside the leg of
your pants un-
noticed, and then
bite you sud-
denly with red-
hot jaws ; neither
can she get upon
to the bough-
shed when you
are having din-
ner, and fall—
again unnoticed
—into your pan-
nikin of tea, giv-
ing it what is
probably the
most horrible
flavor on earth.
The ant can do
both those things
and many more.
If, in a moment
of exasperat i on,
you throw a cow
down a 30ft.
shaft, she will
probably remain
there, unless a
party of fools
comes along and
yanks her out,
in which case
her ingratitude
will be their
affair. An ant
will climb cheer-
fully out of that , -
shaft and renew the attack just when you
have forgotten him. Moreover, the cow lies
under a shady tree and ruminates most of the
day but the an is a perfect dynamo of
diabolical energy all the time. Rescue a drowning
ant and he will bite your finger without waiting
to shake the water out of his hair ; feed a hungry
one, and he, with about 60 millions of his rela-
tions, will come and camp close to your tent, steal
everything m the way of tucker which they can
carry away, and die all over, and spoil anything
which they can’t steal. Then look at the rela-
five chances for retaliation. About the worst you
can do to an ant is to burn him alive, and he
dpesnt seem to mind that much ; hut sool Pin-
cher and Nettle on to that cow and see how
they will make her buck and bellow all round the
horizon—and over it. If your cow is a bullock or
a horse, you can yoke her up, and, besides the
knowledge that you are condemning her to the
worst kind of penal servitude for life, can have
the immediate satisfaction of belting the soul-case
off her. And, after all, nothing soothes a man’s
feelings like being able to belt something till he is
tired.

England (N.S.W.) : Iron-barks, stringy-barks,
apple trees, white box, yellow box, gums of all
sorts, wattles of all sorts, dogwood, dead-finish,

A Maoriland story of endurance :
A rabbiter named Clark on Mount Pisa station slipped
on ice and fell down a steep face, fracturing his hip. In
his fall a sharp rock made a gash four inches in length in
the abdomen, exposing the bowels. Clark, not having a
penknife, made holes in his flesh with the tongue of his
belt-buckle and stitched up the wound with a bootlace.
Later on a younger brother and sister found him and
brought blankets to the place, under which he had to
rest till daylight, as it was impossible to remove him in
the dark.

A. : Your complaints are mostly due to ignorance. Of
the extracts you send the majority are open to no
grammatical question, the others are either solecisms
deliberately quoted or colloquialisms which are already
accepted as the spoken language and will shortly be
accepted as the written language Just a sample of your
ignorance. You object to Tub B. quoting F. B. Norton
as saying “The fault rested with one dummy or the
other! and the judge thought it was me," and suggest
‘me’’should be “I.” The sentence is elliptic, and in
full would read “The fault rested with one dummy
or the other, and the judge thought it was with
me.” You plead for “with I”? It’s shocking
impudence for a man with your want of know-
ledge to lecture other people on their grammar

stamped and expensive poem is rejected P-O.:
“ Man’s Life ” has only two notable lines :
Perhaps to fly to health, content
~ to sickness, ruin, and woe.
The “„ ” is an inspiration.... J.M. : The thing was set
so long ago that it is difficult to find the copy now, but
as far as we remember it was followed as closely as pos-
sible. Even in copying out the two lines you have made,
through haste, a remarkable mistake, and manufactured
quite a new word. A multitude of writers do the same
thing, and when a hurried sub-editor guesses at the word
intended he often guesses the wrong one. When “ sky"
is dashed off as something that might be “sylc” or
“suk,” it has a fair chance to come out “5un.”....

Exhibition of Phil May’s Drawings.
The Bulletin’s collection of Phil May’s draw-
ings, to be sold by Walter Bradley and Co., at
324 George-street, Sydney, on Friday, 18th
September, at 11 o’clock, contains upwards of 100
political cartoons, upwards of 100 portraits and
caricatures (including the famous series of
“Things We See When We Haven’t Got Our
Gun ”), and upwards of 100 humorous drawings.
The cartoons deal chiefly with N.S.W. poli-
ticians of 1880 to 1890. The Robertson Ministry
and its members—“ Jack ” Robertson, ‘ ‘ Cocky ’
Burns, and the rest ; the Jennings Ministry
Pat Jennings, Dibbs, l)r. Renwick, Jack Want,
Copeland, and others ; with the leading Opposi-
tionists —Parkes, Wise, Garrett, Neild, and others
—are shown frequently.
The portraits include leading judges and clerics,
actors and musicians, and a host of other
characters in Melbourne and Sydney. Judge Win-
deyer, Cardinal Moran, Salomons, F. W. Ward,
David Syme, “Daddy” Hallewell and George
Goodman, Lord Loch and Lord Carrington,
Purves and L. L. Smith—these and scores of
others find themselves presented by the most
brilliant portrait-draughtsman of his generation.
To many of the public the humorous drawings
will appeal. There are examples that show
May in some respects at his very best. Jhe
series will be on exhibition next week, and those
who can visit it should not miss the opportunity,
whether purchasers or not. “ There was only one
Phil May ’’—and, once dispersed, such a collection
will never again be brought together.

POLITICAL
POINTS
G. H. Reid and his two opponents did
not, among them, poll at the recent bye-election
as many votes as Harry For an did for the East
Sydney seat at the general election.
Notwithstanding Kingston’s firm adminis-
tration our Customs officials are not in the same
street with those of Freetrade Britain. The other
day a Greenock pig-breeder bought half a ton of
sweepings out of the hold of a sugar-ship, and was
heavily fined for not paying duty on the sugar in
the said sweepings. C~
A couple of months ago a produce broker’s
company in London paid the first-class passage of
one William F. Vizer to New York for the pur-
pose of opening a branch of its business. The
U.S. authorities, under the contract labor law
affecting aliens, promptly shipped William F.
back to England. Down with Barton, of course !
It is commonly reported that Brisbane
Tramway manager, Badger, goes to England to
see if he can get capital to buy up the Brisbane
suburban railways. Minister
Leahy is strongly in favor of
selling the railways, as
neither he nor anyone
else can m ake t h e m pay.
‘ ‘ Making railways
pay” in Australia
means making
them cover all
expenses and
interest on
money bor-
rowed a t
somet h i n g
like 4 per
cent., and
this with-
out the aid
of a land-
grant. No
other thin-
ly - peopled
country in
the world
asks such
wildimpos-
sibili ti es
from its lines
as Australia does.
In Canada, with all
its boom, the privately-
managed railways only pay
2 per cent, on their actual cost,
which is a lot worse than Queensland’s average,
and private management shows up no better in
most other countries.
A Workmen’s Compensation Bill is just
now occupying the Q. Assembly. M.L.A.
Macartney, of Toowong, moved that a mother-in-
law be included in the list of relative-dependants
to be benefited by the Bill. And the Q. Assembly
rose like one man and hissed derision at Macart-
ney, and cast him and his mother-in-law out into
the stilly night.
George Reid’s assurance that at next
Federal election he will fight Premier Barton in
his own constituency evidently means that Reid
confidently expects Barton to take the Chief Jus-
ticeship. . If Barton does go to the poll at next
election, it is about as certain as anything can be
that Reid won’t risk his seat by opposing him.
But, being confident that there won’t be any
Barton on deck next December, it is worth while
for a person like Reid to take up a cheap attitude
which will enable him to pose as the man whose
threatened opposition frightened Barton out of
politics.
ANOTHER FAKIR.
GEORGE REID (who has just fired his Stiger
Vortex): “Gosh! I made sure that would
have brought him down.”
The unprecedentedly small poll at the
East Sydney election fell like a wet camel on the
story about a great uprising of the people to
protest against the conduct of the Barton Govern-
ment. Reid got back, but a mere handful of
people voted, and public' interest was as flat as
the Old Man Plain. No alleged uprising of the
nation ever sat down more unanimously.
Senator Dawson has raised the question
whether the Commonwealth should not establish
a system of wireless telegraphy between Tasmania
and Victoria. The agreement with the Eastern
Extension Cable Co. would not be infringed by
an oversea scheme of telegraphic communication;
“Submarine” is the contract word in the cor-
morant company’s document.
At the recent meeting of Vic. Employers’
Federation, alleged Senator Robert Reid con-
demned the existence of “ paid agitators ” in the
country. Let’s see : What’s the name of the
Employers’ “paid agitator”? And what’s the
name of the little Freetrade paper which is main-
tained in Melbourne by subsidies from the
importers—the Robert Reid crowd—to agitate in
their interests ?
N.S.W. Government is anxious to shirk
a conflict with the Upper House. That House
knows it. The contemptuous rejection of the
Amending Arbitration Bill is to be followed by
the kicking out of the Income Tax Amendment
Bill. It’s a long time since the fossils had a
Premier whom they could kick with impunity,
and they seem bent on getting a good amount of
Rugby out of John See.
Ex-King Mahuta, the M.L. Government’s
new front-parlor boarder, is treating Seddon and
co. very cavalierly indeed. He put in an appear-
ance at the seat of Government after Parliament
opened, and then cleared back North again with
his retinue, and is at present skulking there in a
blanket and top hat. Meanwhile some very
impertinent observations are being made in both
Houses about the wild-pig potentate, and it is
very evident that if Seddon wants to secure the
regular attendance of his dusky nibs at Welling-
ton he will have to pursue measures involving loss
of dignity.
THE BOSS OF THE BULL-COHEN BREED.
Mr. Copeland to Sydney interviewer: “ Our creditors
in England would not hear of the transference of the
State debts unless the principal assets, the railways,
were taken over by the Commonwealth likewise.”
“Mr. Copeland, as you are going to Australia I
have a few instructions in matters of politics
for my mortgagor."
The Senate has agreed to a motion by
Jawbone Neild requesting the Federal Govern-
ment to negotiate with the State Governments
with a view to inaugurating a system of Federal
old age pensions. Neild carefully refrained from
suggesting a method of raising the necessary
money, and, as he strongly advocates cutting
down the revenue by the abolition of duties, it is
difficult to see where he comes in.
A Supreme Court J udge is usually choked
with indignation when a private individual
addresses him by letter concerning a case to be
decided. But, the other day, when Murray Smith
wrote to the Vic. Chief Justice on behalf of a
mercantile firm, whose clerk had embezzled, on a
salary of £2 10s. a week, while collecting thousands
per annum, that the pay was adequate, no com-
plaint of impropriety was made against the
writer.
G. H. Reid, at his fool-election meetings,
called for cheers for C. C. Kingston, because the
latter voted against Bill Lyne’s electoral boun-
daries proposals. But what did Kingston do ?
Merely voted against something which G. H.
Reid himself was guilty of in a worse form for
five whole years in N.S.W. If Kingston’s vote
was a serious reflection on Lyne, it was a more
serious reflection on Reid. Perhaps that was why
the crowd cheered so.
The Boy of the Bulldog Breed, as shown
by recent statistics of how British mercantile
Bhips are manned:

sailors. and foreigners.
1891 145,140 .. 45,464
1896 143,836 .. 65,666

The Freetrade bulldog appears to be diminishing
pretty fast at present.
Sydney D.T. of August 31 printed an
article pleading for “private enterprise” in
water conservation:
Eighteen years of trifling and bungling over a problem
of such vast importance amply demonstrates the inca-
pacity of the Government in dealing with it, and the
necessity of invoking the powerful aid of private
enterprise.
The same issue contained nearly two columns
about the Broken Hill water famine—the typical
bit of experience that Australia has had of the
results of private enterprise in water works.
N.S.W. Public Service Board has put its
foot down on a little “perk.” Hitherto when the
estimates of a particular department were before
the House, the Under Secretary advising the
Minister used to be generally advised himself by
one or more responsible officers of the department,
and for the time they spent hanging around ready
to advise bonuses were paid. Now the Board has
decided that hanging round in this matter is not
to be regarded as an extra.
Recently a temperance deputation inter-
viewed Premier Philp to induce him to enforce
the law relating to Sunday closing in Queensland.
Philp promised he would. A week later the
Licensed Victuallers also interviewed him to
secure an amendment of the existing law so as to
allow of opening hotels during certain hours on
Sunday. Philp didn’t say he wouldn’t. Mean-
time, Sunday trading goes on just the same ; no
one is prosecuted ; and everybody gets his Sabbath
shandy.
In the Westralian Assembly, the other
night, Laborite Taylor attacked Minister for
Works Rason for having attended an election
meeting in order to back up a Ministerial candi-
date by making promises of Government expendi-
ture. Rason retorted that it was only kites that
smelt carrion, and Taylor replied, “You should
smell it pretty often, then.” Whereby Taylor
threw away a chance. A smarter man would
simply have gone over and smelt Rason in dead
silence.
Prohibition has become so violent in
Maoriland that a Christchurch wine and spirit
merchant has been fined for advertising in an
Ashburton paper that he could supply whisky by
the demijohn or case, the head and front of his
offending being that Ashburton has voted no-
license, and is supposed to remain dry until it
changes its mind. Of course, a man might
advertise his liquor in an Ashburton paper because
of its wide circulation in drinking districts out-
side, but the law is too excited now to take
account of such things.
Queensland Labor member Lesina often
steps from the bald track of Parliamentary plati-
tudes, and does unexpected things. A week back
he brought into the State Assembly some tins
and pots of alleged preserves to illustrate his text
on jam adulteration, and urged the shuddering
Philp to taste the pumpkin. Philp declined, and
the House adjourned with the dyed carrot staring
the Boodlewraith out of countenance on the table.
But when Labor-leader To.m Price took some big
potatoes into the House in S. Australia lately,
Speaker Coles promptly ruled him out of order.
So far the Gippsland coal companies, run
by men whose denunciations of State interference
with industry are terrible in their violence, have
put up £227,000 of shareholders’ capital and have
cadged ,£104,800 assistance from the State. Their
£17,000 a year aid is, if Irvine keeps his courage
up, to be cut down to £B5OO, but the frantic
demands of these old Tories for the cash benefits
of “ socialistic legislation” are loud and impudent,
and they may get back to the old £17,000. The
Bulletin believes in the socialistic principle of
State aid to local industries, but when a gang of
coarse old hypocrites denounces the principle and
yet demands the assistance, that gang deserves
the contempt of every decent person in the com-
munity.
Postmaster-General Fysh complains that
there’s too much embezzlement altogether in his
department, and that in future the offenders will
not be allowed to avoid punishment by getting
their friends to make up the stolen cash. Austra-
lasian postal departments have always been very
subject to this disease, but it would certainly be
interesting to learn what P.M.-G. Fysh regards
as a reasonable amount of misappropriation— an
amount that isn’t “ too much.” In the bad old
days of Maoriland, gambling schools used to bar
postal officials. If the P.O. gambler won, the
members of the school had to pay out; if he lost,
the school had to pay out just the same—when the
subscription-list came round to make up his deficit
in order to keep him out of gaol.
If the Victorian farmer, who is now plead-
ing that the State shall come and make his roads
for him, had the pluck and
honesty to make land-
holders pay rent for the
closed roads they now use
gratis, his prayerful hands
would look a trifle cleaner.
F’rinstans : Land along-
side Rupert Clarke’s
Green Hill run, pear
Roms e y, is now let to
dairy farmers at 10s. per
acre per annum. In that
run of about 10,000 acres
Clarke has over 100 acres
of closed roads for which
he pays no rent. That
£5O a year rent which he
should pay would go a
long way towards main-
taining the 16 miles of
road around the run.
_ An interesting question was raised by Jus-
tice Boucautin S.A. Supreme Court, whether a law
that may be passed in that (or any other) State
prohibiting the sale of spirits would be invalid
because of inconsistency with the Federal Act
allowing distillation and sale on certain conditions.
The court said candidly that it really couldn't tell,
and that the Federal High Court will have to
settle that and similar problems some day. The
point has been raised in U.S.A., where the State
right of prohibition was upheld.
The suspension of a high official in one of
the departments is the latest perturbation in
N.S.W. public service. This is only one of the
happenings arising from a squabble over a small
account received from a city firm. That small
squabble has spread to the whole question of
supply of stores to the public service, a matter
which it was fondly thought was put on a proper
basis when the Public Service Tender Board was
established some years ago. The row has led to
so many discoveries that no one knows where it
will end.
RE THAT RESIGNATION.
George Reid, the entertainer, with great diffi-
culty manages to keep in front of the footlights.
The above represents him in his latest mode.
Letter from a municipal candidate at.
Ballarat (Vic.): —
To the Editor of the Courier.
Sir,— As statements have been circulated in reference
to my association with the Citizens’ Reform League,
which originated at Kyabram, I wish to distinctly state
that I was at no time associated with same, or ever have
had any desire to become a member of that society.—
Yours, &c., Henry B. George.
Twelve months ago that wasn’t the way to any
kind of office in Victoria.
The Victorian ’Pootra has not even yet
recovered its second wind, and is still wandering
about in a dazed fashion, feeling the lumps raised
on its head by the Irvine Government’s Compul-
sory Land Purchase idea. The ’Pootra feels very
much like the man who placed the torpid serpent
in his bosom, and was rewarded with a bite ; and
what it is going to do under the circumstances
hasn’t yet transpired. Most of the prominent
’Pootras are, like the Scriptural “young ruler,”
men with great possessions, and—also like him—
the preachment of the new apostle Irvine has
made them exceeding sorrowful.
Sydney Telegraph, discussing the possible
Premiers in the event of Barton becoming Chief-
Justice of Australia, actually talked about the
“claims” of poor old Lyne. No doubt the wish
was father to the thought, and the Telegraph
was dreaming on its linotype of a bygone day
when it had a certain Premier of N.S.W. in its
pocket, and chewing over the fact that a Federal
Premier wouldn’t take up any more room in its
pocket than a State one. Kingston’s name was
never even mentioned. The Freetraders, the
sweaters, the customs fakers, and the swindlers
and robbers generally, and their press organs,
can’t bring themselves to mention Kingston’s
name. It makes them shudder.
Hickford, M.L.A., spouting at a “Free-
trade smoke-night” in Melbourne, graciously con-
ceded an admission that the tariff doesn’t need to
be “completely altered.” But it needs a lot of
adapting to the enlightened views of Hickford.
What he complains of is “the almost devilish
ingenuity exercised to make the tariff so com-
plicated and so irritating as almost to prohibit
importation.” Where do such people as Hick-
ford grow, and how is it that the keepers don’t
notice them getting away over the wall ? Austra-
lia, in proportion to its population, imports more
than almost any other country on earth. It im-
ports for its own consumption more per head than
any other country on earth. And Freetraders like
Hickford gabble of the almost entire prohibition
of imports !
A MATTER OR TWO OF BROAD AUSTRALIAN INTEREST.
According to John Douglas there are 19‘
lepers at the Queensland lazarette under his
control. The wife of one of these un-
fortunates, together with her two children,
has been allowed to follow her husband:
to the island and live there. When a re-
monstrance (on behalf of the children) was made-
to Premier Philp the other day, in the Assembly,
that inconsequent person replied that the children,
ran no danger, inasmuch as it had been shown that
leprosy was non-contagious. The logical construc-
tion of a politician who segregates lepers to pro-
tect jthe community from danger of infection, and:
then allows healthy people to live on the lazarette-
island because there is “no danger of infection,”'
must be something truly fearsome and wonderful.

HYDATIDS CURED BY
VITADATIO
After Eight Years’ Suffering,
Symond’g Place, Adelaide,
„ _ . _. , November 7, 1900.
Mr. S. A. PALMER,
184 Pitt-street, Sydney.
Dear Sir, About eight years ago I underwent an
operation for Hydatids. I understood at the time there
was a possibility of a return of the disease, but all went
very .'veil until last Christmas, when I became ill, a lump
forming in my side, where I had been operated on, severe
pains ensuing, together with great weakness. I became
at last sj bad that I felt like giving everything up and
nfe was such a burden to me. I am a cab pro-
prietor, and managed to drive to your head office for
?, there decided to take a course of VITA-
DATIO. I began to feel better after the fourth bottle,
and after taking nine bottles, the lump has entirely
disappeared, together with all pains and weakness, and
t ln splendid health, and life is worth living again.
I think Vitadatio would be cheap at £1 a bottle, when it
effects cures like mine.
I remain yours truly,
w ., „ „ „ J. McNULTY.

A very quaint Freetrade person named W.
E. Johnson has been writing to S.M. Herald
about Protection. Johnson has four strange delu-
sions : (1) He thinks that the great wall of China
was built to keep out trade instead of barbarians.
(2) He thinks that the wall runs all round China
and talks about it “ enclosing ” the country. (3)
He holds that only countries that are Freetrade or
mainly Freetrade—like Turkey, Scandinavia,
Greece, Mexico and Persia —are prosperous, while
Protectionist lands like the United States,
Canada, Germany and France are obviously
steeped in misery. (4). And he has a wild im-
pression that China, which all its
revenue by direct taxation, laiif|||lp? being by far
the largest item, is a Protectionist country, and
rages accordingly. But W. E. Johnson’s fixed
impression that the Great Wall extends all round
China is a specially noble example of ignorance.

“H.R.H. the Prince of Wales Opening
the First Federal Parliament/'
PAINTING by CHARLES NUTTALL.
SCALE OF CHARGES FOR COPIES: Artist's Proof, £l5 155,; Proof before
Letters, £lO 10s.; Best India Prints, £3 3s.
SOME PRESS EXTRACTS.
Argus : " Mr. Nuttall has been happy with the greater number of the portraits, and with some of them has
succeeded in catching the expressions of his subjects with remarkable fidelity.
Age : “The photogravure reveals a fine and faithful impression of the scene.”
S.M. Herald: “The copy of Mr. Charles Nuttall’s historical painting of the opening of the Commonwealth
by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales was hung in the lobby of the State Parliament House this week,
and has attracted considerable attention both tio .1 members of Parliament and visitors.”
Sydney Daily Telegraph : “Mr. Nuttall’s treatment of this memorable scene, though somewhat con
ventional, is relieved by the general faithfulness of the portraits. The N.S. W. representatives
for the most part are readily recognisable.”
S.A. Register: “ The first Australian historical picture.”
Adelaide Advertiser : “ The Board (of the Art Gallery) decided to secure a photogravure of the painting
of the Opening of the First Federal Parliament, by Mr. Charles Nuttall.”
Brisbane Courier: “ A picture that is likely to attract the notice of all those who take an interest in the
public affairs of the Commonwealth was hung in the State Parliament House by permission of
the President of the Council and the Speaker of the Assembly.”
Sydney Bulletin: “Nuttall’s clever picture has been faithfully reproduced, and the likenesses of the 350
persons are, in many cases, improved by the reduction process.”
General Opinion of the Historic and Artistic Value of the Work.
Being extracts from an essay on the subject by the late Professor Sutherland, M.A., and the opinions of other
public men
“ THE PICTURE represents an event in the Southern Hemisphere that will live as long as the British
Empire lives.”
“It presentsin the most direct way some idea of the personality of the men of whom everyone has heard,
but most of whom a comparative few have ever seen, thus conveying an object lesson that no amount of
literature could possibly achieve.”
“It represents, incidentally, the advance of Australian art in the person of one of its most gifted exponents.”
“ Every year, as it passes, will enhance its value.”
“ A work of art. An historical record of undying interest to every Australian.”
“ The history of a great country, of its great men, of its greatest political event, reduced to the under-
standing of a child at school."

Hawkesbury Spring Handicap and attendant
Gold Oup, run Saturday, fell to Bananaland crack Bride-
groom, but only on the post by a short head, and through
sheer luck, for, after Rockleigh had led all the way. his
rider was apparently caught napping just the least little

showed good stamina. Bridegroom is a six-year-old son
of King Olaf and Tooloona. He ran unplaced in Tatt’s

F.J A.’s win of S.A.J.C. Derby, last week, was

Ike Foulsham’s good looking horse, Galtee
More got away with a 7 furlong race at Caulfield last
Saturday. For some time past Galtee has been numbered
among the “ likely ” lot, but seemingly his defeats were
more genuine than some people supposed. The man in
the street expected him to win when he was a strong
order. On Saturday the starting price of Foulsham’s
frequent disappointment was 15 to 1, and he led every
yard of the way. So presumably it was another instance
of a trainer not knowing when he had a good thing on

Looks as if favorite Famous (whose track-work

trainer Scully’s two mares (Faithful and Marvel Loch)
will close on Epsom, Saturday—that is, unless Purser

mi n ?^ ous ’, as the con tinent owns few better milers.
That those behind Faithful and Marvel Loch are in doubt
concerning the relative merits of the twain is evidenced

was Victorian Florin, who’ll probably start, but latest
display s don t encourage the belief that his prospects are
rosy, though staying powers might pull him through the
Metrop. He closed on V.R.C. Birthday Handicap (Um.)
last June, carrying Bst.—slb. over his Metrop. impost,
but the company will be a lot better this time. Another
(taking a line by his Rawsoh Stakes effort) who threatens
danger m the Epsom (especially if there’s no rain mean-

Argued that if S.A.J.C. Derby winner, F.J.A.,
had come over straight to Sydney after his success in the
Jenkins State, A.J.C. blue riband would have gone to
him, and fact that he beat Duke of Grafton in Easter
Stakes, at Randwick last Autumn, is mentioned in sup-
port. The Duke wasn’t near the horse then that he is
now and ff he keeps in the same state till Saturday it
will take a better nag than has been so far revealed among
the probable starters to beat him. D. of G.’s trainer,
Tom Payten, hasn’t tasted of the sweets of an A.J.C.
Derby win since Camoola succeeded eleven years ago, and
he has been almost as unfortunate with the V.R.C. event •
three years out of four he trained the second horse!
Cocos scored the last success for him.

English cricket team for Australia, as far as
can be gathered from “Yes’’ one day and “No”
another, will consist of four amateurs (Warner,
captain ; R. E. Foster, Spooner and Bosanquet) and
11 professionals (Hirst, Rhodes, Tyldesley, Hav-
ward, Arnold, Braund, Lilley, Strudwick, Knight,
I lelder and Relf), who’ll leave England about end
of present month. Combination is solid though not
altogether brilliant. Foster had an aggregate of 2128
(averaging 50 runs an innings) two years ago, and same
season made two centuries in match Gentlemen v. Players
of England. Last year he only shaped occasionally, and
then 11 innings saw him put 450 together. Bosanquet is
reputed among the most versatile England owns. Rhodes
Hirst and Hayward always looked certainties, and thougn

In school football the winners have put up a wonderful
record Since the inauguration of the competition 14
years ago, King’s School has competed 12 times, winning
9, and getting second place on the other occasions—once
being blown out in a final, and, by coming out on top
this year, they complete the third series of three
successive wins. In the last three years 25 matches were

40 The premiers have now won three shields, and have
a leg-m for Governor Rawson’s trophy. Undoubtedly the
fast and skillful game of the schools is the best from a
spectacular point of view, and, in the final, referee
Pauling, who has filled the bill of umpire in most of the
principal fixtures in the State, found the pace so fast that
he called for a halt for “ wind.” There’s one regrettable
fact about this kind of football, however, and it is the
drastic rule disallowing the “boys” to play in matches
outside the school without a deal of bowing and scraping
for the necessary permit. The State team would be
considerably improved by the filling-up of juniors from
these ranks.

“Mac” Smith—playing in the three-quarter
line for King’s School for the season—gave football records
a great shaking-up. In 22 matches he scored 27 tries,
kicked 47 goals from tries, and 4 other goals—altogether
putting up 188 points out of an aggregate of 428. He

tion, and N.S.W. Rugby selectors for the State should

boxing match the genus pug and those who believe in
film would experience a parlous time indeed. Which
reminds that, until last few months, sanctified Adelaide
had no boxing matches for years, and what it now gets are
of the milk-and-water, half-hearted order. Does the
parson-prompted charge that boxing brutalises hold good

pocket with one hand. Mons. won other matches and
also engaged in boxing, fencing, and sword contests with
some success. He figured in the Franco-Prussian war
and was taken prisoner at Sedan. Breaking* away
subsequently he reached Paris, and, later, was sabred

something to do with his suicide. Victor had exceeded

mittee then asked the third man to sign a declaration,
but he, being slightly honest, refused to sign anything,
admitting to certain irregularities and misrepresentations.
Then the committee took something to keep it up, and
called on the fourth and fifth men to sign, and they made
various excuses and admissions. Then the committee
took to drink, and after several months hard thinking
and drinking converted the bracelet into a sweep
amongst all those who entered, and the upshot was that
a man who never started in the race got the bracelet.
The committee is now suffering a severe recovery, but it
feels sort of happy that the dreadful bracelet has been
finally disposed of.

Commenting on Yes-No Reid’s challenge to
fight the coming elections on the fiscal issue,
Premier Barton gets home on the globular clown
thus:
I stated in the debate in reply and upon other
occasions that it was a pity we had to have a tariff fight
at the general elections, but, as Mr. Reid desires one, the
party to which I belong will undertake the contest with
every confidence. Mr. Reid seems to have said that this
time the fight will be final. I hope he means it. But I
cannot forget that at the first elections he told a press
interviewer at Launceston that the fight then would be
final on his part; so that finality seems to exist in his
mind as a matter with some plural significance.
Which is true enough. And what is Reid’s word
on the matter worth, anyway ? He says that if
defeated next election he will finally drop the tariff
question, but so soon as the following election
comes round the Sameolegeorge will try Bis luck
again. Such tries cost him nothing, whilst they
play into the hands of the importing crowd, inso-
far that the very possibility of Reid gaining power
and wrecking the tariff deters many from putting
their capital in some healthy local industry, and
keeps the whole community in a state of unrest.
The only thing which will make Australia feel
really easy is for some constituency to hit the Yes-
No person hard with the Dry-Dog and so free
politics of both at one fell swoop.

THE Mikado was sitting in his palace, listening to the
sweet music discoursed by the household band. As
the dulcet strains soothed his weary brain, his face lost
the worried look it had worn since the commencement of
the war. There entered an orderly, bearing news of a
great victory. “Go forth,” commanded the Oriental
potentate, “ and fill every man’s instrument with gold.”
Hard luck,” murmured the mouth organist, who used
the famous “Crackajack” ; “my instrument is so com-
pactly made that there is no waste space, and it will hold
nothing but music.” A decisive defeat, however, altered
the aspect of affairs, and the sweet, but stern, voice of
cT High Executioner was heard, commanding each
of the band to swallow his instrument. “My luck again,”
quoth the “Crackajack” playermine is the only
instrument in the band that will go down, but sooner
than lose it I will swallow it. Thank the Lord, it’s got
no sharp corners.” _ Crackajack Professional, 40 reeds,

George I., of glorious memory, had a fine
contempt for “Bainting and Boetry,” and the
city fathers of Brisbane evidently say ditto.
They have the gall to charge £50 a year for an ill-
lighted room in their ramshackie town hall,
wherein are hung the pictures of the National
Art Gallery. As a protest against this grocery
spirit, Queensland Parliament knocked off the
amount from this year’s estimates, so no doubt
the Art Gallery will be thrown into the street or
cast into a back room among the dog licenses.
Kingston made a vigorous speech at Gee-
long to a crowded house, the other night. An
extract from the Argus gives an idea of its
strength and the way in which it was received
As Minister of Customs he had striven to do his duty
Some had tried to do him out of duty. (Laughter) They
were caught in the act. They had had a fright which
would be to their moral edification for years He honed
it might finally land them in (A Voice- “Pent-
ridge.”) Mr. Kingston : No. In heaven. (Laughter )
Nothing had such a reforming effect as a little prosecu-
tion—brought up with the drunks. A little interview in
a back office and a pecuniary penalty were not objected
to, but exposure in courts, in company with owners of
unregistered dogs, was dreadful. (Laughter.) He had
been there himself. (Laughter.) More be token the
dog did not belong to him—(laughter)—but he was fined
just the same. (Laughter.) Yes, herded with drunks.
Men celebrating a christening or a wedding, and rolling
home, were brought before the court and lined There
was no backstairs interview with the Minist r. They
were fined 5s. for a solitary lapse from temperance, but
the man who dared, time after time, to evade his just con-
tribution to the pockets of the country through careless-
ness, or incompetence, or worse—a lie sworn to—what of
him? (Applause.) If he had added a new line of policy
a new era of Customs management, it was such as he was
delighted to be connected with. It was not his own
money he had been looking after—it was public money
(Applause.)
DON’T EXPERIMENT.
When suffering from a severe attack of Diarr-
hoea, don’t waste any time experimenting with
various medicines, but take at once Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy. The result is
certain—a cure will be effected. Get a bottle to-
day ; it may save a life. Costs Is. 6d.*
When the directors of Gippsland coal
companies decided many months ago to reduce
their men’s wages by 33 per cent., and thus
brought on the long-continued Outtrim strike,
they tearfully declared that their business was
not paying, and they could no longer stand the
strain. Theotherday, when they went round to see
Premier Irvine and protest against the abolition
of their subsidy, their balance-sheets came to
light, and disclosed the fact that they had been
clearing 7 per cent, dividends. If their second
bagful of protestations, that it will be impossible
to carry on unless the State railways subsidise
them by carrying their coal at a loss, are as reli-
able as their earlier excuses to the miners whose
wages were cut down, the State will be justified
in_ treating the tricky coal directors with some-
thing more than suspicion. The disadvantages
of “fiddling with socialism” must, by the way,
be very apparent to avowed individualists like
coal-director Boyd, M.L.A., and other frantic
supporters of the Irvine Government, which is
cutting down the State support of coal companies,
and is trying to screw up its courage to tell pri-
vate enterprise to grub round after the 7 per cent,
dividend entirely on its own. Some of the coal
people roust begin to realise that unrestricted
business enterprise, without any Socialistic foolerv
on the part of the Government, isn’t what they
imagined it.

The fact that, after Gregory Wade had
declared himself a candidate for Willoughby
(N.S.W.), the Yellow Pup bigots adopted him as
their candidate, suggests that there certainly
ought to be some legal process by which a
politician could prevent himself -being publicly
“adopted’’ by undesirable parties, or could
recover heavy damages from objectionable parents.
A candidate is known by the political company
he keeps, and he should be able to choose his
company. A man who was going strong for a
seat might easily find his hopes blighted through
being publicly adopted by hangmen, keepers of
two-up schools, welshers, Mormons, Yellow Pups,
Fenians, importers, dog-stealers, and the like.
Few man have a better knowledge of the
working of the Lands Acts than has Land Agent

results is not only reasonable but also novel.*
Mr. M. J. WILLIAMS, Lawton Junction,
Ky., Nov. 1, 1899, writes :
■“ I was troubled with a THROAT AND LUNG AFFEC-
TION, and got verv low. JAYNE’S EXPECTORANT
COMPLETELY CURED ME.”*
The cheekiest thing yet evolved by the
defaulting Victorian farmer was the demand made
on Water Supply Minister Cameron during Show
week by representatives of Wangnratta borough
Council. It seems that when The great Water
Trust Repudiation Act was passed in ’99 this
blessed borough was “forgiven ’ £958 arrears of
interest it owed to the State. It would have
owed more than that, but it had paid £150, and
it was so sorry at having paid that much that it
promptly went £150 in arrears again. And what
these fine manly farmers wanted to explain to
Cameron was that they were sorry they had
paid that original £150 —about one-sixth of what
they had undertaken to pay —and that they
wanted their new £150 liability cancelled to make
up for it. Even the easy-going Cameron nearly fell
down dead.

Sydney representative of Burns, Phil [> and
Co. has come forward to state that all the coastal
steamship cos. do not agree with the Kingston
policy of Protection for the Australian shipping
interest. He doesn’t explain that the claim of
his firm to speak on behalf of coastal shipping
depends on its agency for one co.—the A.U.S.N.,
and that it has thirteen foreign-going shipping
lines under its wing trading with As a, America
and Europe. Another humorous gentleman to
protest against Protection to Australian shipping
interests is the local manager of theK T orth German
Lloyd Co., who thinks that “protection and large
subsidies tend to make steamship management
less efficient.” This from a German co. which
claims that, under German Protection and subsi-
dies, it is the most efficient shipping co. going,
and should be patronised accordingly !!

VERTEX CELLULAR UNDERWEAR
■yOU need to take particular care at this time of year
against colds and chills, more especially when throw-
ing off Winter Underclothing for lighter Summer wear,
and the only material which may be relied upon as ar
absolute safeguard from the effects of sudden clime t
changes is jQERTEX CELLULAR.
When one wears underclothing of this fabric, he or he
is safe from “ taking a chill” as, owing to its p; .uliar
structure, it operates to retard a too rapid evaj ..ration
of the body’s natural heat in its insensible vapour—the
cause of the “ chill ” —allowing simply any excess of over-
heated vapour to disperse gradually and imperceptibly.
In its functions it resembles in this respect the true
epidermis and acts, in fact, as a supplementary skin, and
for this reason so many medical men order it for invalids
and delicate children, and recommend it to all their
patients for general wear all the year round.
In addition to men’s singlets, pants and drawers, we
stock linen-fitted Dress and Day Shirts. Soft-fronted
Shirts of every description. Pyjamas, Hosiery and
Sundries.
For ladies —undergarments of every kind, Corsets,

KUTNOW’S POWDER.
A Perfect Remedy for Constipation, Derangements of the Stomach, Liver,
and Kidneys, Influenza, Rheumatism, Cout, Lumbago, Uric Acid Troubles.
Read what “The Medical Journal,” Nov.,
1902, says concerning Kutnow’s Powder.
“ Disorders of the liver—whether arising from excessive
or deficient secretion of bile, with such well-known character-
istic symptoms as headache, nausea, pain in the abdomen,
diarrhoea, low spirits, or with the important symptoms of
dyspepsia such as constipation, a feeling of abnormal fulness
or emptiness, heartburn, an offensive taste, foul breath, a
furred tongue, flatulence, irregular heart action, an emaciated
countenance, drowsiness, and languor—these are now most
successfully treated by Kutnow’s Powder. This preparation
is a natural antiseptic aperient. It acts as a solvent, loosen-
ing all hard faecal matter which may have accumulated, and
eliminating the same without any suggestion of griping or
pain. Amongst the many eminent specialists who have com-
mended Kutnow’s Powder in the highest terms we note the

Kutnow’s Powder, although containing no sugar, is pleasant
to the taste, decidedly refreshing, and is well sustained by
the most delicate stomach. It produces an immediate sense
of relief, or to put it in the words of a patient, ‘lt seems to
at once take away a load of trouble.’”

Unique Testimony.
“ Kirsteen, Cissbury-road, Brighton,
“Dec. 15, 1902.
“Gentlemen, —You kindly forwarded me a bottle of your Kutnow’s
Powder a short time ago. lam very unwilling to testify, like the majority of
people do, that things have worked wonders, but really I cannot speak too;
highly of it. I have suffered for years from constipation and liver troubles.
Your Powder has done all that it claimed, and more than that—it has given
me comfort. I have since taken two bottles, and have to-day sent an order to
my druggist for three more. Its action is sure and gentle, and 'at the same
time certain without any distressing effects. It would be a boon to many who
suffer in the same manner, and whenever I can I shall recommend it. —Thank-
ing you most sincerely for so good a remedy, faithfully yours,
“R. BARCLAY (Capt.).”
Beware of Fraudulent Substitutes.
Caution.— There are some unscrupulous dealers who, for
the sake of extra profit, try to foist upon the public substitutes
for Kutnow’s Powder. They may cost a few pence less, but are
worthless, and consequently dear at any price. Do not allow
yourself to be persuaded to accept any substitute.
Accept only the Genuine Kutnow’s Powder.

A fatal fluency has drawn public attention
to Mr. “Monty ” Arnold, of Sydney, who retired
from N.S.W. public service 13 years ago on the
ground of ill-health with a pension of £192 a year.
The broken-down gentleman started .business in
Sydney and prospered ; and he once stood for
Parliament and got 357 votes. Lately he was
part of a deputation that waited on Premier
Barton, and he also, as chairman of Stockton Coal
Co., delivered a violent address about the socialis-
tic tendencies of the people who paid his pension.
His energy on these occasions has created an
impression that he is fully recovered, and it is
proposed to ask him £q.r,esume his old billet, and
to stop his pension if he doesn’t.

Doesn t look as though even one of the Arltunga
wild-kittens will get a chance. The amalgamation pfo-
pMal, which was wise, is not making headway ; and the
Winnecke s Proprietary has consequently been thrown
into the bucket. '
* * * *
From the considered report of S. Australian
Government Geologist Brown, on the Arltunga and other
ho Whip F p prospects : r“ Arltunga the reefs outside
the White Range are of small size, but have been, and
conhnue to be ’ m T ed P rofi tably. Except those at
the White Range, up to the present' no gold-bearing
deposit has been found sufficiently large or extensive to
be worked on a large scale. ”

The last half-year’s work of the Tasmania—the
ilyspeck s premier gold mine—showed a loss of £8507.
o " t ® ld . e ‘he purchase money and consideration
shares. The last half-year s work showed a loss of £8507,
or £1 2s. 9d. per oz. of gold won ; and only £3328 of this
went in developing the mine. The £5OOO paid by the
option syndicate appears to have been used in the ordi-
nary course of business, probably in reduction of the
overdrafts, which, nevertheless, still stand at £13,080,
™ le “ e liquid assets amount to only £13,385. For a co.
which has, during the last few years, paid £772,072 in
dividends the Tasmania’s present position is disgraceful.

no J' rom Queensland: Raub’s latest crushing of
2350 tons for 5900 z. is a steadier. Ditto Woodlark Island’s
600 tons for 1390 z., valued at £472. The boomed rush
near Warwick is as d,ead as mutton ; so is the Alice River
rush, upN.Q., and an alleged alluvial rush near Rock-
hampton is not even a living for the patient fossicker.
But the old fields are still doing some brilliant things.
Vesuvius (Charters Towers) is not to earn the
unenviable distinction of making the 100th call—not for
some tune to come at least. Taking advantage of the
boom the directors wisely disposed of 1250 forfeited
shares, with the result that co. now has a credit balance
of £1424. Co. still holds 1150 shares. Why not dispose
of these and get £2OOO to credit ? This wo'uld do a lot of
driving and sinking in search of that reef which only a
few en thusiasts believe to exist. 00. has stopped sinking
towards Hades, and is now pottering about in the shal-
lower levels.

Smith’s Creek tin shares (North Queensland)
have come down with a run and have not yet touched
bottom, but,it Will not be long before they reach that
point ml. Captain Warren’s ambiguous report
on the property some months ago was not properly
interpreted by the principal Adelaide shareholders, who
preferred to exaggerate the favorable lines in the
report and to minimise or ignore the condemnatory or
doubtful portions—the doubts were most carefully ex-
pressed in what the astute captain omitted to state. Now
Warren has again reported on the mine. This time there
is no ambiguity or inferential doubt. Nothing could be
straighter than this: “At the present rate of ex-
traction the whole of the ore in reserve should be taken
out in the next three months.” No wonder that at the
general meeting the chairman had to state that “ Matters
at the mine were far from being as satisfactory as the
directors could wish.” Mr. Warren’s report will probably
mean the closing up of the mine. What will be the sense
in crushing the remainder of the ore reserve, seeing- that
no profit will result from it ?

About the best Brand for Sheep now in the
market is Kemp’s Branding Liquid. It goes further and
is considerably cheaper than any other. It will dissolve

hope to get a good price for their wool. E. Rich and Co.,
Sydney and Brisbane, hold stocks.*

There’s a screw loose somewhere in Bewick,
Moreing and Co.’s classification of Westralian mining
costs. Theinspireable ” London press, and the press
that cribs but never originates in Australia, are constantly
full of eulogy on this-astonishing firm. They claim to be
reducing costs all round ; but how do they do it ? Take
Oroya Brown Hill, for example—Australian costs only—
exclusive of any robbery that may be effected in London |
Yield for June—Bo4loz., worth £29,833, from 3944 tons.
. , . Costs.
Mining .. .. .. Bs. sd. per ton
Treatment .. .. 17a. 7d.
General Expenses .. 3s. 2d. „
Total .. ~£l9s. 2d. „
Total for 3944 tons, £5752.
This looks all right, and will no doubt be given full notice
in the inspired papers aforesaid. But then we come
to the following other little items : “ Total development
expenditure, £3312,” or 16s. 9Jd. per ton, and ‘‘total
other capital expenditure, £8967,” or £2 ss. sd. per ton.
Thus the total costs for the month amount to £4 11s. sd.
(=loz. ljdwt. fine gold) per ton of ore worth £7 11s. 31d!
The amount available for dividend to shareholders for
that month is £11,765, or £3 per ton treated.
No doubt it Would be claimed that “develop-
ment” and “other capital expenditure” should not be
charged against the tonnage. Development, or a part of
the development, certainly should, as in stoping a certain
amount of development work is rendered useless and
should be written off. If the ore is obtained in develop-
ment, a proportion of the cost of development should be
charged to “ ore extraction.” The same claim would be
put in for “ other capital expenditure,” but as it recurs
so regularly in the monthly reports —owing either to
replacement of defective machinery or to installation of
new—it should be treated as current expenditure and
charged against the tonnage.
Writer thinks the cute Yankees nowin charge
are making a name for themselves by manipulation of
figures. The best managed shows in W.A. are not those
managed by 8., M. and Co., but mines that pay all ex-
penses—including “development expenditure” and “all
other capital expenditure ”—on stuff worth 28s. to 30s.
per ton; like the Lancefield and the Mount Charlotte
lender Henry Nutman. The Lancefield, by the way, was
ujnder option to 8., M. and Co., but they wouldn’t con-
cjude the purchase despite the fact that they show
clearly—by press reports—that they treat the Gwalia
ore at 21s. 2jd. per ton. Bewick, Moreing, and Co. are
good managers of newspapers and jugglers with
figures. Tom Bent was not considered a great success
as manager of the Victorian railways, but no one can say
tjiat he saddled them with a lot of useless plant. Anyone
can see that 8., M. and Co. have done this with the Brown
Hill, and that at a heavy price. Therefore, Tom Bent is
better than Bewick, Moreing, and Co., which is con-
clusive.

Gulden Link’s Eclipse lease (W.A.) continues
to develop splendidly, and a large reserve of oxidised ore
is now opened up. A peculiarity of this lode is that,
PIESSE'S ORCHARD, KATANNING, WEST AUSTRALIA. [ Seepage32.
although it is very wide and strong, it seems to be com-
pletely cut. off before reaching adjoining properties.
Diamond drilling and prospecting have, so far, failed to
find the continuation of the lode in the Kalgoorlie Amal-
gamated. Possibly, if a lot of tributors were allowed to
fossick around, the missing lode would quickly be dis-
covered. The Eclipse mill is to be doubled, as well as the
cyanide plant, but the additions are not expected to be
ready till the end of the year.
* * * *
Great Boulder Proprietary (W. A.) will probably
resume its place at the head of the list of W.A. gold
producers next year. Manager Hamilton will very likely
remain in London as consulting engineer. It is possible
that 100 head of stamps will be erected, and some of the
present mill and roaster plant fired on the scrap heap.
Recent developments in all parts have been very
encouraging, and the mine could easily yield a larger
output. The main lode at 1750 ft. is 30ft. wide, and worth
28dwt., so there seems to be no falling off either in size or
value as depth is attained. The September div. is only
9d., as against Is. in June, which is hardly pleasing to
optimistic holders. However it will let loose £65,625.
At Poverty Point.
Miss Romer, as she was known on the stage, mother of
Robert Brough and of Miss Brenda Gibson, died recently
on board the Orita on the way to England. Paralysis
was the cause of her decease. It is eight years since Miss
Romer left off being about the finest representative of
the stately elderly countess and the dignified drawing-
room parent that Australia ha 3 seen for many years. In
the palmy days of the Brough co. there was no lady in
Australia who could surpass her as the shocked peeress
in a castle when her daughter had made a mesalliance, or
her son had become entangled with a barmaid ; or as the
lofty moral relative whose son-in-law had been found
under circumstances that required explanation in the
company of a Greek statue which had come to life while
the family was at the theatre.
“ Melb.” : “ This tune goes merrily ” was my Shak-
spearian thought, coming out with the crowd from the
pit of Her Majesty’s, on Saturday night, after seeing “ If
I Were King.” Here was real flesh and blood. I even
fancied that Cuyler Hastings could act Hamlet, and
Atholwood’s Louis XI. was quite a resurrection of
Charles Kean, or suggestion of Irving in one of his best
roles, in a different play. To be sure “If I Were King ”
consists of shreds and patches, but it goes overwhelm-
ingly. There is Don Caesar de Bazan in it, also the
Three Musketeers, likewise Ruy Bias. What a fine hint
of the Dutch painters Rembrandt, Teniers, and Hals, in
the opening scene of the Tavern, with its vagabond
crowd of men and women. How charming the scene of
the Palace Gardens, both by sunlight and moonlight.
You are at some such place as Versailles, St. Cloud, or
Ohenonceaux. Gordon the second is all but up to his
lamented sire as a painter.
George Musgrove has formed a high opinion of Maori-
land as a field for theatrical endeavor. So enamored is
he with the prospects that his representative has made an
offer for the purchase of the site of the Wellington
Skating Rink—a fine corner section in a thickly popu-
lated part of the city— with the intention of constructing
his own theatre. The rink is owned by one Macartby, a
beer potentate. Macarthy is one of the directors of the
Opera House, and is not likely to part with the property.
Besides, he has enough to keep two or three generations
of Macarthys. Musgrove’s “ Sweet Nell ” season in Wel-
lington panned out £220 per night.
The interval between Bland Holt’s first production of
“ The Golden Ladder” in Melbourne and its first revival,
which happened last week, was rather more than 13 years.
Of the original cast three men—J. A. Rosier, W. H. Leake
and Augustus Glover—are certainly dead, and several of
the other people have left the country. Bland and Mrs.
Holt, Albert and Harry Norman, and Walter Baker, seem
to be the only members of the present co. who appeared
in the “ Ladder ”at the Alexandra (now Her Majesty’sl
13 years ago. Baker then played a minor part. Plimmer
and Harry Roberts were also numbered among the pro-
mising juveniles.
“ Adelaide ” : Please, who is Joseph Wilson ? Accord-
ing to a glowing article (with portrait) in London Sketch,
he has produced a play called “ A Test Match ” all
through Australia with immense success, and is booked
•for a return visit to Sydney, to last 10 weeks. S.A. is ex-
pressly mentioned as a scene of his operations.
“ T.D.” : Another instance of the tendency of families
to set up voice monopolies was given by Lalla Miranda’s
sister at a parade of pupils in Melbourne the other night.
This girl, with a taking stage figure, a clever manner,
and young unwearied voice, simply walked away with
Marguerite’s part in the arduous garden scene, her
associates falling far into the ruck.
Dan Barry has been confessing his sins to an Adelaide
reporter. Dan will be 44 next birthday, and says he has
been acrobat, theatrical agent, jeweller, patent medicine
vendor, and other things. He and a friend invented a
new cool drink once, and did well till one day his mate
got the jim-jams or something, and mixed the ingredients
up wrongly, and nearly slew a whole town. Dan
calmed down his advts. for the Adelaide season and billed
his show as “Dan Barry’s Famous Dramatic Organiza-
tion,” which is quite mild.
“ J.F.D.” : “ The quaint old Chow, with the fat front
and the beautiful long silken beard,” mentioned by
“ T.D.” (B. 27/6/’O3) still adorns Paddy’s Markets, but
no showman could get him. He is religious, and views
the stage as a specially baited hook on the devil’s soul
line. If Bland made overtures to him, he would have to
do a faster break than he did when coursing with the bull-
dog. That CKi>w can hold up his end of the stick, too, in
a fight, and when his white beard rages in the forefront
of tbe battle it is good to be elsewhere.
A Melbourne Correspondent writes to say that it is
“amusing to hear people say they don’t like Cuyler
Hastings as Villon on account of his American accent.”
Well, nobody wants to hear Villon talk broken French-
English; still there are limitations. Joseph of Canaan
with a strong cockney accent would also be all right in a
sense, for no one would expect him to talk Yiddish and
to carry a bookmaker’s bag and offer to lay Pharaoh 4 to
I—but again there are limitations.
Organist Lemare says the mechanism of Melbourne
Town Hall organ is out-of-date and almost obsolete, so
that many interesting items had to be omitted from
the intended programme of the Melbourne recitals.
Malkum M'Eacharn promises improvements next year,

The English and American stage has been haunted by
a good many peers who, as a rule, acted badly. Now it
has captured a Sultan. Our late coffee-colored friend,
Mr. Johore, threatens to embark on a stage career
shortly, but whether in comedy or variety business he
doesp’t yet know. ,
One night-, during the “Sherlock Holmes” season at
Brisbane, an interesting event happened in the family
circle.
The sale of The Bulletin s collection of
Phil May’s drawings will he held by Walter
Bradley and Co. at .324 George-street, Sydney, on
Friday, 18th September, at 11 o'clock.
Obit.: Melbourne attorney David Braham,

The S. M. Herald’s latest explanation is
that thousands of people didn’t go to the poll to
vote for Reid in order to show their disgust at
Barton. Some day so many people will be
showing their disgust at Barton that Reid will
lose his seat altogether.
In N.S.W. Assembly, the other night,
“Cocky” Carruthers boldly declared that he
“ would make war on those who were the para-
sites upon labor either in Parliament or out of it.”
“What do you mean?” asked a Minister,
naturally. And then it suddenly dawned upon
“ Cocky ” that, as usual, he meant nothing, and
he paused for about three weeks.

The latest row between Queensland
Justices Real and Griffith is a ridiculous affair on
Griffith’s part. A man was convicted at Gympie,
and his counsel asked the judge to reserve a
point. The judge refused to make a note of the
point. When it came up he said, lelying solely
on his memory, that it wasn’t the same point.
The counsel said it was the same, and be was
backed up by two reporters who heard the case
and took written notes. It was a case of one
man’s vague recollections against three men’s
written notes. Griffith held that because the one
man Was a judge his vague recollections must be
taken without question. The less bumptious and
more sensible Real held that a judge might forget
just like any other man. Nevertheless the
prisoner’s appeal was refused a hearing because
the point now taken was not the point in the
judge’s vague recollections. This kind of law is
calculated to bring Australian Courts into con-
tempt.

STRENGTHLESS and AILING MEN.
Men who have for years been in the Grip of
Disease seeking relief and finding none, and have
given up hope of ever again being healthy and
strong, should wear for a few hours nightly
THE FREEMAN & WALLACE
“ INVIGORATOR ” BELT
which is sold for ONE POUND ONLY, and see
what it will do for them. Consultation personally
or by letter is PItEE. It is more than strange that
so many Young, Middle-aged, and Old Men
suffer as they do, and the illness is more often than
not the result of some
without delay treated
and such scourges to
species of blood poison, either hereditary or acquired. Possibly it is the latter, and, if so, it shou c. e
radically and drastically. There is no time like the present for dealing with such physical enemies
the public health. Every man should act when opportunity offers. Delays are always dangerous.

Mr. G. F. Dyer, No. 2, Barcom Avenue, Dar-

scourge of the country districts, Hydatids, says:

I think it a most wonderful cure.”

Mr. G. H. Bernard, Accountant on Gamnain
Station, via Wagga, who was, to use his own
words, “ a physical wreck,” corresponds thus :
“The half-yearly balance, which I
dreaded, is now over satisfactorily,
thanks to the admirable condition in
which you had my nerves and brain. I
can honestly affirm I am a cured man.”
INSOMNIA.
Mr. 0. H. Pairbairn, Mt. Zeehan, Tasmania,
a sufferer from Insomnia, superinduced by
Typhoid fever, in his letter states
“Chronic Dyspepsia and Insomnia is
certainly a curse. Of all the treatments
I have tried, yours has done me most
good. I now eat without fear of bad
after effects, and sleep soundly.”
WEAR NO
Sufferers should wear no other Belt than THE FREEMAN AND
WALLACE BELT* It is the finest sold in Australia* It is guaranteed
OTHER BELT
by reliable electric authorities. It has a patent electrical attachment to regulate the current to suit the patient’s needs. Although sold
for £1 only, it is honestly worth £lO. Worn for a few hours nightly, its soothing current enters the nervesand re-mvigorates every fibre an
tissue of the body. If you suffer you should wear this wonderful instrument. Diseases classed as " IN^
its use. Grave nerve diseases such as INSOMNIA, EPILEPSY, LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA, PARAPHLEGIA, LOSS OF VITAL ENERGY, RHEUMATISM,
SCIATICA, NERVOUS WEAKNESS, VARICOCELE, PROSTATIC and BLADDER TROUBLES, KIDNEY DISORDERS, have been remedied permanently.
Worn, in conjunction with sound medical treatment, it is essentially the cure where the obsolete methods of drug treatment have failed. Thousands
of sick persons have testified gratefully to its wonderful healing influences. Other Belts, which are sold for £lO and £5O, are in no instances equal
to this “ IHVIGORATOR,” thousands of which are in use in Australia to-day. The “IN VIGOR ATORS ” sold at £lO contain 2oz, 18ct, gold, and
£8 is allowed in return for one even after a cure has been effected. Before purchasing an electric Belt from any Sydney firm write to the Institute
for particulars. It will pay you.

“P.M.” on “The Flames of Smithfield ”
(B. 6/8/’03) contributes these remarks :
(1) If the R.C. Church holds the most valuable sites it
has got them, like other churches, by State grant and
purchase. But has it like other denominations put on to
the market land granted for religious purposes ? (2) Re
intolerance. At the Christian Brothers’ schools attend
Jews, Protestants, and even Chinamen. They are never
troubled with religious teaching at all. My son, nominally
Church of England, attends, and I know. (3) As for
Roman Catholics accepting all help and assisting none:
their charitable institutions are open to all without
religious distinction or favor. I am a life governor of St.
Vincent’s Hospital, Melbourne, and I know. (4) Fact is,
shortly, R.C. organisation knocks all other church
organisation kite high. It is simply,its success which
constitutes its sinfulness. Pity other churches are not so
sinfuily successful or successfully sinful.
Lately the ultra-Tory Adelaide Register

State-interference tactics which are now advo-

said that he hadn’t come to any such conclusion,
that the Register’s yarn wasn’t true, and that in
Queensland and South Australia, the only States
he had so far investigated, “the Labor laws are
not materially different from those in the United
States. *

Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
THE FAMOUS RE3VETIDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OP ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs ” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.
BE-WA.R.E OUT COUGHS !
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.

too ILL TO LEAVE HIS BED.
A COMPLETE CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.— Dear Sir,—l am writing: to tell you
about the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks. —Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that 3 r our Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, l was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
“Yours very truly,
“M. MORTIMER.
Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Ur. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, Katunga,
Victoria.
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE'S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do —send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

“Sir.—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from

be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’
prescriptions and patent medicines having been tried ;
but I am happy to say that the cough, pain in the chest,
and difficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by
the fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure. —I remain, Sir,

A Seven Tears’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.”
Asthma.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
A SEVENTEEN YEARS 1 CASE.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J.' Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, writes : —“After suffering from Asthma for
17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to try Heafne'S
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then,
which was in the beginning of 1883— 15 years ago—l have
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.”
Writing again on the 4th April, 1899, he states:—“l
am keeping very well now. Never have the slightest
return of the Asthma."

One good thing ha* already come of Iceberg
Irvine’s new industrial legislation proposals.
Derham, the biscuit man, who occupies so much
space in the Tory press declaiming against factory
legislation, has been led at last to state exactly
what he and his Chamber of Horrors want.
Hitherto, Derham has been so busy shouting out
what he didn’t want that he had no time to say
quietly what he did want. The other day, he
found the necessary time : “I had hoped to see
tiie whole of the present system of factories law
abolished, and in its stead an Act passed which
would have for its sole object the prevention of
sweating of boys.” This avowal is remarkably
frank for Derham, Hitherto men of his class have
solemnly sworn that they were tearing their
clothes in the rush to stop sweating of all kinds.
Now Derham comes out with a clear statement
that the demand of the Chamber of Horrors is to
be allowed to sweat men and women just as much
as it pleases. And as to protecting tlie “old
and slow worjter,” about whom Derham and co
have been so; mucih grieved, he isn’t even men-
tioned. It will hurt the kindly feelings of Derham
to suggest it, but Mt would certainly appear that,
inasmuch as you can’t sweat a boy to the same
profitable tune as. a man, the employers are
graciously pleased to say they have no objection
to the protection b.f boys.

Governor Ranfurly’s term of office in
Maoriland ends early in 1904, but he has signified
his intention of remaining till May, to see his pet
scheme—the Veterans’ Home, at Auckland—
formally opened. It is much needed, too. Some-
how, army medal-winners generally fail, in after-
life, when storming the baker’s shop for a loaf.
Bent’s day in the Victorian " Railway
Department is over, and, in most cases, the only
reminder of his misrule is the disorganised state ol
the service. But, at Sandringham, the hand of
Thomas is plainly visible. A new station, costing
about £2500, was erected, during Bent’s adminis-
tration, to adorn a fearfully unprofitable branch
line. And now all the vacant allotments of land
in the vicinity are decorated with notices, viz. :
“ Free railway pass. This land for sale on easy
terms. Money lent to build with. Apply,” etc.
Sandringham is in Bent’s electorate.
One Job Vile, who unaccountably ousted
Stevens for Manawatu at last M.L. elections,
asked Premier Seddon, in fine regal style, t’other
day, if he intended reducing the salaries of Minis-
ters and members to their old level. Seddon told
Job that he wasn’t going to do anything of the
sort; screws would be increased rather than
otherwise if. he took it into his head to deal with'
the matter. Personally he was getting £1000 a
year less than many big commercial magnates,
and his idea was that he should get more. It is
well, however, that the cheap legislatorof the Job
Vile sort should be aware of his true value.
To prevent Croup, begin in time. The first
symptom is hoarseness ; this is soon followed by a
peculiar rough cough, which is easily recognised
and will never be forgotten by one who has heard
it. The time to act is when the child first becomes
hoarse. If Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is
freely given, all tendency to croup' will soon dis-
appear. Even after the croupy cough has
developed, it will prevent the attack. There is
no danger in giving this remedy as it contains
nothing injurious. It always cures, and cures
quickly. Sold everywhere*

GLEAN BLOOD.
THE KIDNEYS ARE THE CLEANSERS.
For a person to enjoy good health it is essential that the blood be kept free from all eontamina.
tion. It must be purified by the kidneys and liver. As the blood flows through the veins it becomes
laden with certain matter which has been used up by the tissues. When the blood, in the course of
its circulation, reaches the kidneys, the kidneys extract this waste matter and cause its removal from
the system. If the kidneys, from weakness or disease, are working feebly, a portion of this waste
matter remains in the blood and becomes actively poisonous. The kidneys of the average individual
filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine in twenty-four hours. In this quantity of
urine should be'dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains in weight of uric acid, together
with other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce. These
are all solid substances, but they pass from the body in complete solution if the kidneys are working
efficiently. It is easy to realise-the important functions which the kidneys perform. Unless the solid
substances are removed suffering must ensue. In fact, to the retention of these urinary poisons in the
system nine-tenths of all pain and sickness is due. Sometimes minute crystals of uric acid form
in the blood and are deposited in the joints and tissues of the body, thus causing the acute pain felt
when we have
RHEUMATISM, GOUT,
Lumbago, Neuralgia, Sciatica, &c. Sometimes the uric acid crystals, aggregating together
in the kidneys, form Gravel and Stones, and cause Kidney Colic, and Irritation, and
Inflammation of the Bladder. When the kidneys are working perfectly we experience none
of these pains and disorders, as the causative poisons are then duly removed in a natural manner.
WARNER’S SAFE GURE
is an unfailing specific for all disorders of the kidneys and liver. It acts directly on those vital organ
in such a manner as to always restore them to vigorous health. So intimate is the relation between
the functions of the kidneys and those of the liver that it is essential, in order to cure any disorder of
either, that an agent should be employed which possesses an equally curative action upon each. In
other words, when the kidneys are sick the liver is sick also, and the contrary is likewise true. The
supreme power possessed by Warner’s Safe Cure in the treatment of diseases of so, apparently,
diverse nature as Rheumatism, Gout, Lumbago, Neuralgia, Sciatica, Gravel, Stone,
Bladder Troubles, Blood Disorders, Indigestion, Biliousness, Jaundice, Sick Head-
ache, Aneemia and Debility, is entirely due to its ability to restore to health and robust activity
both the kidneys and the"liver, when all urinary and biliary poisons are duly expelled from the system
as required by nature. The blood is then clean and we cannot suffer, as the cause of suffering is
removed.
The most common symptom of kidney disease is
PAIN IN THE BACK.
A surer test is to place some urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and
iet it stand until the next morning. If it is then cloudy or there is a brick-dust like sediment, if
particles float about in it, or it is of an unnatural colour, then the kidneys are not healthy and
Warner’s Safe Cure should be instantly resorted to or Bright's Disease, Diabetes or some less ,
serious but more painful illness will surely result.
Mr. P. Elliott, of 52 Surrey Street, Darlinghurst, N.S.W., says:—
“ Having bien a sufferer for over five years from kidney and bladder complaint, I went 1
to all the principal doctors in Sydney, Melbourne and New Zealand, and they all gave my case up as
hopeless. I got thin and lost my appetite. I kept getting worse every day, and often wished that I
could die. One day I read one of your books, and decided to try the effect of Warner’s Safe Cure in
my own case. I began to feel better after taking the first bottle. My appetite can e back, and I
began to put on flesh. I took six bottles in all, and am now quite well.”

The Road to Hell.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Now I had thought the road to Hell
A dread and dreary place,
With spirits fell, to grin and yell
In each man’s tortured face ;
Who fain would slip from spur and whip
To weep a little space.”
“ Nay, he who told thee of this thing
Full foully hath he lied ;
The road is bright and rose-bedight,
The way is fair and wide ;
And Wit and Grace with smiling face
Walk with thee side by side.”
“But I had thought the road to Hell
A crowded path and steep,
Where one must go in gloom and woe,
Nor pause to rest or sleep,
And though he sink have naught to drink
But tears that hot eyes weep.”
“He lied who told thee of this thing !
The road is free as air,
And soft to tread as roses spread
When forth the bride would fare ;
And sweet and fine the bread and wine
White hands shall serve thee there.”
“But I had thought the road to Hell
To be a lonesome wt.y,
Where all alone, as s< ms dull drone,
One languished right and day.
Though others wore the path before,
They could not speak nor stay.”
“ He lied wh • told thee of this thing !
On that fair road and free
With laugh and song shall dance along
A goodly company;
And, all above, thy red-lipped Love
Wall" baud in hand with thee.”
“ But 1 had thought the road to Hell
W„aid echo with men’s sighs,
And through the night would burn the light
Of woman’# tortured eyes,
And rock and plain breathe back the pain
And anguish of old cries.”
“ He lied who told thee of this thing !
On that gay road and bright
The sound of flutes and silver lutes
Shall lure thee and delight,
And suns by day shall pass away
For love-white moons by night.”
“ Though I fear not the road to Hell
Wherein ’tis joy to wend,
How shall it be with one when he
Hath reached the journey’s end,
And out leaps Fear with shriek and leer
His shrinking soul to rend ? ”
“Nay, he who walks upon that road
Doth meet no monster fell;
The clasp and kiss he would not miss
Have bound him as a spell,
And they alone nor sigli nor moan
Who walk the road to Hell.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Good God ! ” exclaimed Murphy. “ Look at
that.”
But the colt I was riding had already seen “ it,**
and absolutely refused to go nearer. So I dis-
mounted and dragged him on, trembling in every
limb.
Pinned to the ground by the trunk of a huge
tree that had fallen across his thighs lay the body
of a powerful man. Evidently a scalper, for some
yards away, at the foot of a white gum, 1 saw his
sheath-knife and a Winchester. He was naked
down to the waist, and though he could not have
been dead many hours, the ants were at work
already ; had been, perhaps, before he But I
could not bear the sight, and turned away with a
shudder.
Poor chap ! Must have been having a spell,
when the tree came,” resumed Murphy, who had
been surveying the situation critically. “But
what did he want with this here fake at all
at all?” ’
The “ fake” proved to be a rough sort of lasso,
evidently manufactured by the trapped man out
of strips of his shirt; and from the position of
the body, and the direction the sling had fallen in,
the purpose was not difficult to discover. The
prisoner had been trying to possess himself of the
knife or the rifle to put an end to his misery But
the feeble, hampered efforts had been in vain;
and the torn ground about told its tale of lonely
agony, easily decipherable.
Well, well,’ said the imperturbable Murpliv,
after a pause ; “it’s a divil of a country, and no
mistake. But the best thing we can do is to bury
the poor fellow in a decent manner. I’ll dig a bit
of a trench, and you better have a look along that
creek yonder. Maybe you’ll strike his camp
there; it’s the only water for miles around.”
In a business-like' fashion he caught the pack-
horse, and, with his prospecting shovel and pick,
set to work, while I started off for the creek. I
did find the camp, too, but the closest search
revealed nothing more than a bit of tucker and a
few old rags. Not a scrap of writing, or a paper
of any description.
“Did you strike it ? ” asked Murphy, as I slowly
returned. I nodded. And after we had levered
the tree off the mangled remains, and carried them
into the shallow pit that was soon filled up again
with the loose sandy soil, Murphy, as a devout
Catholic, murmured some fragmentary prayers,
and then began to cut the date of burial into the
trunk of the big gum at the head of the grave. I
stood by and moodily watched him. The ghastly
humor of the thing exasperated me—this fearsome
attempt at a joke the bush had perpetrated.
Before my vision arose the scene, vividly. The
helpless victim, in his unbearable torture ; the
sun, the thirst, the loneliness, the ants —and
there, a few yards away, the unfailing panacea
the gleaming barrel that meant delivery, mock-
ingly; utterly b yond reach ! The improvised
lasso, so pathetically inadequate, thrown with
trembling fingers, to snare the black angel hover-
ing gloatingly around ! . . ,
‘‘Find out his name?” asked Murphy, finish-
ing off his work with a very ornamental cross.
“ I know his family name, at any rate, I
answered, evasively. , , .
“ Well, then, put it down underneath the date
here It’s getting late, and we must be off.”
And with a few deep cuts I chiselled into the
soft wood, “ Tantalus.”

The Pig.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The common pig, for downright obstinacy and
contrariness, beats any animal invented up to
date. This assertion may not be original.
There is about the pig a brutal resolve to have
his own way, which stands out conspicuously
above the mild opposition given to man’s com-
mands by other animals. A pig whose wish is
opposed, works himself into a frightful state of
passion. No other animal is such a pronounced
gourmand, and as his brain is only capable of
working by stomach inspiration, he takes par-
ticular care that his meal hour will not pass
unnoticed. A pier whose meal hour has passed
over without the arrival of his slush is a fiend.
He keeps up a squeal of demoniac frenzy which
is earsplitting. If in company with other pigs,
they arrange to squeal in turn, each trying to get
a higher note than the other. Their protests
when assaulted with a fence rail for kicking up a
row are even worse.
My father had a taste for pig-farming, and
utilised his Sundays by tramping to other farms
within a fifteen-mile area to buy swine. I gener-
ally accompanied him, and we drove any pur-
chased pigs home across country. They possessed
the strategy of a De Wet, taking up positions
which were unassailable. They would get into
creeks, waterholes, or prickly scrub, climb up
tr.,es, and drop into hollow logs, and from those
points of vantage heave out sulky grunts at our
vain efforts to dislodge them.
A white boar with one ear that we acquired at
Narellan one Sunday was the most unmanageable
pig I ever met. We started for home about _ 2
p.m., but he entrenched himself on a sandbank in
Curran’s Creek and defied us for four hours. Mick
Curran came down to help us with his dogs, and
he managed to lassoo the foe with a clothes-line,
and we dragged him out. Dad told Curran about
his obstinacy, so Curran proposed that we
should drive him in the opposite direction
to the one which we wanted to take. We did
so, and got him- home at 10 p.m. Only
that he was white we would have lost him in the
darkness. He got even with ua for the trick.
When he found that he had been got home he
refused to eat, and lay down on one side till he
expired. His hide was so thick on the side he
lay on that Dad cut a cricket ball out of it for little
Paddy. Curran’s idea was a brilliant one, but it
cost us £3 15s. If we had got that boar home by
fair means I think he might have forgiven us.
The Germans near our place would catch all
pig’s blood at killing-time, and use it in manu-
facturing black puddings. Mother Bruckhaiser
had a big milk-dish full at our killing one night
—the life-blood of seven pigs. She was fill-
ing the dish from the blood flowing from the
throat of the eighth pig, when Peter Mahoney,
who was holding the pig in his last moments,
released his grip. That pig was on his feet in a
moment, and picking Mother Bruckhaiser out of
the group of spectators, he charged. She wasn’t
a sprinter, and the dish of blood handicapped her,
so he caught her halfway across the paddock,
knocked her down, upset the blood, and then fell
dead on top of her.
I always think the rebellious character of the
pig is the bond that endears him to the Irish
nation. No one ever saw a satisfied pig ; he is
always in a chronic state of rebellion, and will
argue with anything from a rooster to a tramcar.
In fact, the pig is a low, vulgar animal, who takes
an easy first for sheer “cussedness” and obstinacy,
leaving the cow, ram and gander far behind.

Broken Hill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bei oiie you reach the place you are depressed.
You travel by train from Adelaide —a night jour-
ney, always a depressing thing in itself. After
vain efforts to snatch a few minutes’ sleep in an
unccm for table, crowded second-class carriage,
you sit up and watch the ghostly dawn creep over
a ghostly landscape. Treeless, waterless, grass-
less —brown, bare, monotonously level. Unin-
habited by man or beast, so far as you can see.
You look round at your depressed, dishevelled
fellow-passengers, and the insistent suggestion is
that you are all lost souls travelling together to
Gehenna.
On leaving the train the first inhabitant I saw
had his arm in a sling. The next hobbled along
on crutches. Then I met the ambulance on its
way to the hospital with an accident case from
amine. In Argent-street I passed a funeral pro-
cession. The town clock was stopped (its chronic
state, by th 6 way). The scavenger carts always
contrive to be in the main street about 8 a.m.—
sweeping up the gutters and stirring up the smells
just when the train arrives and lands strangers in
the town.
Broken Hill is a great town to do business in—
of a sort. If you want to go speedily to ruin,
start a grocery store. You will do a grand busi-
ness. All the bad marks who can’t get tick else-
where will cheerfully run up bills with you.
Broken Hill people are the most shifty and shift-
ing population in Australia. It is cheaper to shift
than pay the rent. About 10 per cent, have several
names, answering indifferently to either, and run
up bills in each. The people don’t buy firewood
—they steal it from each other. Very few people
fence their garden plots—the neighbors use the
fences for firewood. Standing at your back-door
you can see the back doors of all your neighbors.
You can’t hide your goings-out and comings-in.
The drainage system is perfect. All slops are
emptied on the sandy soil of the back yard. It
soon dries up, and you can’t tell that anything had
been emntied there—except by the smell.
Saturday night is a perfect saturnalia of beer.
It is flowing in ever}' hotel bar. The popular
pubs, are jammed with men hustling to get to the
bars for drink. There are fights going on in
eiery corner, and there is a constant procession
of policemen from the pubs to the lock-up with
drunks. On Sunday morning, the first duty of
every free and enlightened miner is to go to the
police-station and bail out his mate The hotel-
keepers bail out the rest. I know one who bailed
out 17 of his own customers one Sunday morning.

An English Morning.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This morn, in close-drawn winter dress,
I sought a far suburban way
And watched the toilers onward press
To where the smoke-wrapped city lay.
A distant clock with throbbing tongue
Across the icy atmosphere
A chime of six abruptly flung,
And yet no sign of dawn was near.
The sleeping East lay dead and still
Deep cradled in the halls of night ;
And westward, calm, serene, and chill,
A full moon flooded all with light.
No clouds were in the steely sky ;
The stars stood out like lights at sea.
No skirl of wind went wandering by
The mist-enshrouded house or tree.
A silver-featured frost was there,
Mocking numbed feet With grating sound ;
It smote strong plants with white despair
And trailed their limp leaves on the ground.
It touched the roadways, and it laid
Quaint tracings where the stones did meet;
It touched the outer slush, and made
. ,■ . . *
Fantastic figures in the street.
And, of the crowds that westward went,
It chilled the weaker through and through,
And keen with biting discontent
Painted their lips a palsied blue.
And, oh, that sweeping surging throng !
Women whose sex seemed almost dead, ■ ,
Qld men and young, the weak, the strong,
Child ren'Scant-clad and poorly fed :
I watched them, as I walked beside,
Pass westward to the daily yoke,
Till, 'Us the 'moon-lit minutes died,
The city swallowed them in smoke.
Then, homeward turning, lo ! the sun
Up from the East in splendor rolled,
And roofs snow-laden, one by one,
It decked in fancies red and gold.
And well-fed citizens and sleek
Came forth to breathe the bracing air,
And down the radiant roadways seek
The bright sumglories beaming there.

The Big Tank.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Thb Big Tank was an engine which Dan Jefferson
drove on the 1 Short Hill section of the Maoriland
railways. At 6.30 every morning the Elephant
pulled out with the North Express, and the Big
Tank moved from her stall in the engine-shed,
coughing and gasping in the morning mist, and
put her broad chest against the tail of the train.
Then they went roaring up the grade.
The Tank went with the Elephant co the top of
the hill at Thomsontown, where she ran on to a
siding ; and, after the passenger-train had lurched
out of sight, they set the Tank kicking trucks about
the yard. These were for the heavy goods-train,
which left the city an hour later than the express,
in charge of Jane, a low-geared, low-funnelled,
low-looking engine, with a reputation for holding
her load on a down-grade and being the dirtiest
engine on the section. Beside the line, about
halfway up the hill, was a farmhouse, and in it
lived, besides other people, a girl— the girl, so far
as Jefferson was concerned.
When the Elephant blew for the last tunnel,
the Big Tank did so too, though there was no
necessity for it, since she was not in charge of the
train. But the whistle had a peculiar intonation,
which Jefferson’s girl knew.
She usually tried to get a glimpse of Dan
Jefferson through the heavy smoke from the
engines. This was also unnecessary, for when the
Big Tank had finished shunting at the hill-top, she
came crawling backwards, down the hill, and
usually stopped so that her driver might get a
note, or a button-hole of flowers, or something,
from his girl. The fireman was a discreet man,
and always found something to oil on the blind
side of the engine. Probably he had done the
same sort of thing himself before he married.
One morning, after pushing the North Express
•up the hill, the Big Tank proceeded, with the
assistance of a much smaller namesake, to arrange
a string of trucks, for the up-goods. She was
B' ngone towards the main line when Jefferson
a shout, and, looking back, saw the station-
miaster signalling him. The smaller engine had
Ikicked a truck along the main line, and a shunter
Hiad jumped off the foot-brake, and had turned to
meet another truck, but it was plain the first
waggon would not stop before it reached the
down-giade.
Jefferson saw all this, and, giving two short
whistles, he backed the Big Tank and sent her
whirling past the station. Two more shunters
were running vainly after the truck, and the
stationmaster was calling up the station at the
foot of the hill to stop Jane. But Jane was up-
to-date, and some distance up the hill. The last
the panting shunters saw was flie truck, which
was half-full of sand, swerving violently round
the curve on its way to destroy Jane when they
met on the grade, and the Big Tank racing after it.
“Was the coupling-hook up or down ?” the
stationmaster asked.
“Down,” one of the shunters answered. “It
would shake down anyhow,” he added.
“Then he’s got a chance, if he can hit her hard
enough.” . ,
The couplings were of the American single-
buffer, automatic-hook pattern.
Just above the farmhouse there is a place called
the Semicircle—the line sweeps round the head
of a wide gully—and when the Big Tank, with the
truck still racing free in front of her, swung into
the Semicircle, Jefferson blew a long blast on the
whistle. He had bumped the truck twice without
succeeding in coupling on, and, as the grade was
becoming steeper, he began to despair of doing so.
His fireman had volunteered to crawl round on to
the cow catcher and do it by hand, but it was a
dangerous thing to attempt at such a speed. _ A
tank engine has no tender, and it meant climbing
over the tail of the engine. So Jefferson whistled
wildly, hoping that Lavers, the driver of Jane,
.would hear, and reverse that approaching female,
and set her flying downhill to a place of safety.
His girl heard the whistle, and looked up the
line in surprise. She had just heard Jane call,
away down the hill-side. She saw the truck, and,
close behind, the engine. As she looked, Jefferson
sent the Big Tank at the truck in another attempt
to get hold of it, but he only succeeded in making
the truck travel faster.
She was a clever girl. She left her work and
flew down the precipitous hill to the lower side of
the Semicircle. There were fallen trees on the
hill, and she selected one and tried to roll it
towai-ds the line. At first it refused to budge.
Far below she heard Jane blow for a tunnel, and
suddenly the roar of the flying truck and engine
reached her ears. With a final effort she sent the
log on to the line and it fell across the metals.
Then she ran swiftly up the line.
When she came in full view of the Semicircle
the sight made her heart stop beating. The big,
double-bogie waggon was flying madly down hill,
and, swaying and lurching dangerously, the Big
Tank raced after it.
But her coolness returned instantly, and she
stepped into the middle of the line, waving her
arms.
The Big Tank screamed, and the girl leaped
against the bank as the heavy truck swept past.
Jefferson had decided to try and knock the
truck off the line at the bend where the girl had
thrown the log, but at sight of her danger he put
his brakes down, and, as the engine screeched past
her, he leaned out and heard his girl scream :
“ Stop ! stop ! the log ! ”
And the Big Tank came to a stand-still, with a
great groaning of brakes.
_ Jefferson wiped his forehead and moistened his
lips with his tongue.
** What’s up, Loo ?” he asked. His voice shook
a little.
“I rolled a log on the line. I put it there to
stop the truck. Listen ! ”
They heard a bumping sound. It was the
truck floundering about like a blind megatharium
down in the valley hundreds of feet below them,
and disintegrating as it floundered.
“ I’ll go down and see if the track’s all right,”
said the judicious fireman. “ Maybe she ripped
it up ”
The fireman found the line unhurt. He heard
Jane struggling-at a walking pace up the grade,
so he sat down and waited for her. When she
came up he stepped calmly on to the footplate to
tlie surprise of her crew.
“ We’ve come down to pull you up to the
yards, ” he said to Lavers.
Lavers became profane.
“ Where’s your engine ? ”
“ Round that bend.”
“Well, I’m damn glad to hear it,” said Lavers.
“For this old force-pump can’t get any gait on a -
all. Time she was put to pushing perambulators.”
As Jane approached, the Big Tank moved
slowly up the hill till the couplings clashed, and
the fireman, swinging himself into the cab, said :
“Let her go !”
Then she threw her great strength on to t' e
load, and blew proudly because she was in the
lead.
But Jefferson’s girl shut her ears to the sound.
She hated the Big Tank.

The Pension.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jenkyn Jessop (cetat 70), having battled about in
the Bakblox until he could battle no more, made
application, in a moment of senile temerity, to
the Baratarian authorities for the customary
indigent dole of some few shillings per week, and
then waited three months, during which time the
police ascertained the following facts :
(1) That he had never been in gaol.
(2) That he had never at any time been addicted to
strong drink.
(3) That he hadn’t a solitary relative, from a mother-
in-law to a forty second cousin, on to whom the State
could shelve the responsibility of his maintenance.
After all these matters had been satisfactorily
settled the allowance was finally granted.
The first two instalments arrived duly at
Jessop’s address, Greenvale station. Then they
suddenly failed altogether, and the old man had
to live on credit and casual charity. Some
months of inquiry resulted in the discovery that
the aforesaid allowance had been sent, by official
error, to Green Hills station —200 miles away. As
no one called for it, it was assumed that Jessop
was non-existent and the pension lapsed.
After a wearisome and dreadful amount of
further correspondence, officialdom finally acknow-
ledged its error and, by way of expiation, pro-
pounded to Jenkyn Jessop, by formal epistle, the
following poser —Hoiv had he lived during the
months in which he had received no pension.
Jessop, a methodical old fellow, replied promptly
by sending in his unpaid bread bill to show that
he had lived on the credit and kindness of the
local storekeeper.
Hereupon officialdom scratched its fat Bara-
tarian skull, and, in the genuine spirit of honest
reform and Kyabram economy, wrote back in tlii,
wise:—
Sir, —As you have evidently been able to live for the
last three months, without the assistance of the State
Indigent allowance, the Minister can see no sufficient
reason why you should again be placed on the list of
persons receiving that allowance.
And the Baratarian deficit is getting gradually
lightened by the amount of Jenkyn Jessop’s bread
bill.

its politicians, it doesn’t know a better man to
live out of N.S.W. than Hassall. The political
standard of N.S.W. isn’t high, but it rose percep-
tibly when Hassall left, and the increasing
strength of the Labor party has had the blessed
result of making Hassall’s departure out of poli-
tics a permanent affair.
It is practically certain that the system of
aldermanic patronage —the system by which no-
body gets a corporation job unless he is an alder-
man’s friend—doesn’t work well in Sydney. When
a ganger dismisses a man for inefficiency and finds
him coming back to work and taking no notice of
the dismissal, it is awkward; and when a boy,
being urged to greater celerity in his work, tries
to drag the alleged boss away by the coat so that
they may immediately interview an alderman, who
will deal with the boss for being cross with the
alderman’s pet boy, it is ridiculous. About the
most interesting story, so far, however, is that of
the man who was so confident that his alderman
would see him through that he proposed to hit the
ganger with a spade for ordering him about. It
really looks as if every public functionary in
N.S.W., except the Judges and the hangman and
the official botanist, existed chiefly for the pur-
pose of getting some friend or other a pick and
shovel job, and enabling him to tell his overseer
to go to Sheol after he has got it.


Purifies the Blood
Bushmen Must Drink Bad Water. This Makes Bad Blood. Sickness
Follows. How. to Make the Blood Pure.
um
i
Mr. Alexander Johnson, of Bourke,
New South Wales, sends us his photo-
graph and says:
“ For many years I have been en-
gaged in shepherding, stock-droving,
and other occupations so well known
to buskmen. Often the drinking-
water was very bad, and I was ex-
posed to other hardships of bush life.
I found all the men around me using
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, so I tried it. For
cleansing and purifying my blood, and
for giving me new life and energy, I
found it the most wonderful medi-
cine I ever used. I do not see how
bushmen get along without it. I
advise all who read this to keep a
bottle of this grand medicine on hand
all the time, for it’s a great, health
preserver.”
“The World’s Greatest Family f^edicme.”
Perhaps you are not exposed to all the hardships of bush life. Yet you
have probably suffered from impure blood, great debility, nervousness, exhaus-
tion, indigestion, and other evidences of a weakened system. No matter what
your occupation, nor where you live, if you are in need of a blood-purifying
medicine and something to build up your nerves, you should certainly take
this grand family medicine.
You will make a great mistake if you try any other Sarsaparilla than
“Ayer’s.” This is the kind that has been making the cures for sixty years.

TUB BROWN=SEQUARD TREATMENT A SPECIALTY.
Melodramatic justice happened up north
some time ago. A private detective, who was
put on to the labor unions’ tracks in troublous
times to worm out their secrets; and who figured
as a red-hot propagandist, had to be away from
home so much that, he says, his wife got tired, and
disgusted, and found out that he wasn’t the only
pebble on the beach. His real character was
discovered some years ago, and he was expelled
from the union, and wasn’t any more use as a
detective; but the -shameful admissions of the
part he played now come from the man himself in
the Divorce Court.
“L.W.” : Every day the trail of the
blessed Yankee grows wider and wider across the
face of this planet. The latest development of the
disease is a Vegetarian Mission, yrhieh, true to
Yankee instincts and methods, runs in the shape
of a syndicate, and calls itself the “Sanitarium
Health Food Co.” It has a vegetarian cafe in
Pitt-st., Sydney, and has branches in Melbourne,
Wellington (M.L.), Queensland, Perth, Tasmania
and South Australia. It also has a sanatorium at
Wahroonga(N.S. W.). But the co.’s most valuable
possessions are a number of sweet-faced women
who distribute literature and talk pleasantly, in a
dignified manner, of the utter ruin that bull’s
meat and Dago-sold fish bring upon a household.
Their literature is not so dull, either; in fact, for
a religious commercial enterprise it is extremely
bright. It tells you things like this: “ Says
Seneca: ‘Many dishes, many diseases; be not star-
tled by the multitude of diseases —count the cooks.’
Among birds, these that sing are grain-feeders,
while those that eat meat croak. . . . Worry is the
most popular form of suicide.” The new religion
maintains that the kitchen, where the food is
cooked, should be a clean, bright, cheerful apart-
ment ; and lays it down as the first commandment
that the dining-room should be the most cheerful
apartment in the house. It falls heavily on the
pipe, and points out that when the good house-
wife desires to rid her pot plants of insect pests
she merely calls the old man and bids him blow
a few puffs of cigar smoke upon them, and the
pests are dead. Apparently the co. wants to
encourage insects, for it reckons that this handy
insect-destroyer should be abolished. Don’t know
why it is so fond of insects. I recently marched
into the cafe and tried to go through the whole
course of healthy, life-giving foods. It seemed to
me that the taste of the peanut was in everything.
It was like the p.n. that is ever being renewed.
For people who like peanuts it would be heavenly.
I ran through six courses, and finished up with
unfermented wine, and came away with an un-
satisfied feeling, but so puffed out that my feet
were invisible. Talk about “ fulness after meals: ”
It was a perfect revelation of what poor Dry-Dog
Reid feels like. A man that feels blown out like
that can’t be anything else but a Freetrader. It is
the only creed that can make him feel thin again.
