Henry Lawson
Henry Lawson’s verse in its three hand-
some new volumes (The Poetical Works
of Henry Laicson; Angus and Robertson,
1925) stands much as it must always stand
for the generations of Australians; but a
great deal of interest gathers round the con-
jecture as to how the future will look upon
those lines; The opening words of the col-
lection instantly bring up a vivid picture
and a genuine emotion to living Austra-
lians :
The colors of the setting sun
Withdrew across the Western land —-
He raised the sliprails, one by one,
And shot them home with trembling band.
Will the future find there the opening of a
door into all the past? Will the judgment
of the ages on all the mass of work that
follows justify the estimate in which Law-
son’s work was held by men of his own time?
There are plenty of people now living who
are ready enough to write a negative to both
questions. They assert that his< work in
verse' is even now forgotten, that the changing
fashions of men’s minds wall miss whatever
there was of the artist in the crudeness of
his workmanship, and that Lawson’s place
must only be that of a literary curiosity—-
the raw writer of the most obvious emotions of
a raw and unformed people. This view of
the poet and his work is based upon certain
false conceptions with regard to both. That
certain elements of craftsmanship are absent
in much of Lawson’s work may be admitted;
but this should not obscure the fact that at
his very best he showed Something like a
supreme, craftsmanship. A small anthology
of quatrains, lines and phrases could be
easily made from the poet’s work which
would strikingly compare with a similar selec-
tion from that of men who were admittedly
supreme masters of their craft. To express
an emotion, in the fullest possible way in
rhythmic words may be taken as the thing
at which all craftsmanship aims. That
Lawson does this with great frequency
must be set in the balance against whatever
crudity of form and handling much of liis
work shows.
The future is hardly likely to raise any
argument on that aspect of the work; but
it is always possible that some of the emo-
tions expressed—turning as they do on things
which bulked largely in early Australian life
and have already ceased to exist—will be
missed by the majority of his distant readers.
Very much of the same kind is actually lost
to us in Shakspeare to-day, though scholars
of the Elizabethan period try hard to explain
and reconstruct. Yet while something must
thus pass there is much in Lawson which
is sufficiently descriptive and explicit to
actually preserve for us things which would
otherwise be lost—buried under the dust of
the years. Readers in far days will find a.
whole realm of romance in the collected
poems, and perhaps discover the greatest
charm in the very passages that to our
nearer view look a little drab and mean.
Apart altogether from their poetical value,
Lawson’s verses cover a wide sweep of
national story in directions where it has
been touched very ineffectively by other pens.
But the greatness of Lawson will always de-
pend on the lyric force of the lines that must
keep on singing in the heart. Interesting
as lie is in all respects, the final judgment
upon him can only be based upon this eter-
nal force. There is not one standard of
judgment for him and another for other
singers; the final test is the same in every
case. When he sings
I’m at home and at ease on a track that I know not
And restless and lost on a road that I know,
the musical flow of the words must waken
an echo in every wanderer’s heart. Who
can resist the appeal of that simple refrain
of “The Sliprails and the Spur”? Who can
deny the power of the stirring and terrible
vision of war in “The Star of Australasia”?
On the two poems mentioned, which are
placed first in the collected works, the repu-
tation of any poet might stand.
There is another test, too. In the
collected work of most writers —-particularly
those who have covered a wide field—there
is always a good deal of rubbish. Lawson
may also carry some dead weight of matter
which the future will ignore; but it is hard
to find a greatwriter of verse who has left
us less that fails' in interest. Consider for
a moment the dull mass of wholly uninspired
commonplace to be found under the names
of Wordsworth, Shelley and Tennyson. Com-
pare the worst of Lawson with the w’orst of
Burns, or place the weakest work of the
Australian poet beside the later verses of
Kipling,., Lawson.will come remarkably well
out of such a test. If he does not challenge
the highest at their highest and best he can
yet claim continuous flashes of inspiration
as real in their way as those which have
lighted up the world.
But Lawson needs no special pleading or
apology while so many of his contemporaries
still hold the magic of his linies in their
hearts. The collected works in bandy form,
with three excellent portraits in color, will
be greatly appreciated by those whose old
copies of former volumes have begun to be
thumbed to pieces with loving use. Few
Australians could find a fairer gift for an
Australian friend; and no library should
miss the chance of having on its shelves the
full and correct text of Lawson’s work.

Birds and Poets
Of ten or a dozen sets of verses* appearing
in a recent Bulletin, something like two-
thirds, contained more or less graceful refer-
ences to birds. That started me. ruminating
on the marked advance which Australian
versifiers have made in this sphere .of late,
and I began to put together some observa-
tions on the general subject, notably 4 in re-
lation to the possibilities .for an antViology
of local bird-verse, on the lines of those
produced in England and America. Bfeit at
that stage the birds and poets had pefiforce
to be forsaken for the more {esthetic jd,b of
pursuing politicians in print; and, mean-
while, one “J.M.D.” has come upon the lied
Page (12/11/’25) with a. lament over w£uat
he believes to be the paucity of nature-
verse in Australia.
“J.M.D.’s” trouble is that he dogmatises
without particular knowledge. It is well
enough to complain that many local bards
are obsessed with dells and fells and moors
and coppices. Lowell launched a similar
charge Against his Yankee brethren some
eighty years'ago :
Jes’ so with poets; wut they’ve airly read
Gits kind o’ worked into their heart and head....
This makes ’em talk o’ daisies, larks and things
Ez though we’d nothin’ here that blows and sings.
But the man who yearns to speak a piece
on such a point as this must have a shield
ready, lest his charge become a boomerang—
it is less culpable in a poet to neglect his
country’s birds and flowers than it is for a
critic to spank the poetic faculty generally
just because he doesn't know what has been
done. An early remark by “J.M.D.” is that
ornithologists know well that our magpie
and butcher-bird are better songsters than
the nightingale and skylark, yet they have
found no verse-champions. Personally, I
don’t see much value in these airy com-
parisons of bird-songs of quite different types,
and I have never, as an ornithologist, ac-
claimed our friend Madge above Philomel,
though a writer in The Bulletin’s wide-
flung column recently
quoted me as doing so. But the chief point to
be made is tlisft several -versifiers have ren-
dered homage to the magpie in quite worthy
rhymes—some of them memorable. O’Hara’s
verses are good. So are those of Esson. Frank
Williamson's lines are as melodious as the
song itself. And there are others. Leave
Keats and Shakspeare aside and consider
how many modern British bards have
achieved anything notable in reference to
the nightingale. A quatrain by W. H. Davies
is the only melody of the kind that lingers
with me.
Reflecting on our bird-verse generally—l
am more concerned with this than with
nature-verse at large—it is an easy con-
clusion that until the last decade or so there
were not half a dozen good sustained efforts
made in Australia. Kendall’s “Bell-birds,”
Paterson’s “ Black Swans ” and James
Thomas’s “Water Wagtail,” good poems and
true, stood out pre-eminent. Someone may
say that Mary Foott's "Where the Pelican
Builds” demands acclaim, but this is no more
a bird-poem than is Coleridge's “Ancient
Mariner” or Poe’s “Raven.” Apart from
these direct poems, however, there were a
score of passing flashes of bird-wings—stray
feathers showing the way the zephyr was
blowing. You get some of these in Hubert
Church’s verse, others in the fairy fancies of
Edith Vivian (that clever girl who died over-,
young early in the present century), others
again in the woodland verses of lamented
Jennings Carmichael, some even in the elvish
lyrics of Victor Daley, and many in the
Celtic-Australian rhymes of Rod Quinn. At
the risk of disagreeing with my brother bird-
ologists, I suggest that the spirit-of-fact is
more worthy here than the matter-of-fact;
wherefore, I should not worry if Rod mixed
his thrushes and butcher-birds, so long as he
remained true to that Bulletin verse of
long ago:
He knows the calls that the birds have chorused ;
He understands what the winds would say ;
He sees tar oft', in an ancient forest,
A hand that beckons his soul for aye.
So with Mary Gilmore. What matter
whether her “Singer in Brown” be a wren
or a thorn bill, or the central figure of “Sing
Sweet, Little Bird,” be Gerygone alpogu-
luris or Gerygone cantator?— it is sufficient
to know that the writer lias "shaken out
her carols” as freely as the birds themselves.
For the rest, there are J. Le Gay Brereton,
Elsie Cole, Arthur Bayldon. R. 11. Long,
11. W. Stewart, Frederick Macartney, “John
O’Brien” (lots of bird-notes in the "Boree
Log”), 11. M. Green, M. Forrest, Molly
McNutt (good, homely bird-verse), C. H.
Souter, Will Ogilvie, E. S. Emerson, C. J.
Dennis, Dorothea Mackellar, and (if you
please) Bernard O’Dowd and Hugh McCrae.
(These last two, be it noted, are somewhat
patchy as to Australian wood-notes, and one
does not yearn to be lost in the bush in their
company.) But there is a more recent versi-
fier who has outdone all the rest as a singer
of birds —one 11. S. LCgge, author of “At
the Edge of the Bush,” published a few
weeks ago. Here is a man who knows his
birds surprisingly well, and is able to cause
them to fly in verse; his score or 3o of
charmingly specific poems are, in good sooth,
worthy of their subject.
Is the day of the anthology closing? If not,
Australia has the material for a very happy
and alluring little collection of bird-verse.
England and America have given us at least
two each —“The Poets’ Birds” (1883) , “The
Birds and the Bards” (1894), “Through the
Year with Birds and Poets” (1900), and PI.
,T. Massingham’s collection of 1922, “Poems
About Birds.” The first two are relatively
unimportant. The American anthology of
1900, however, has approximately 250 sets
of verse, drawn from some 80 writers, and
much of the material is delightful—pure out-
of-doors. Massingham’s new collection is
chiefly English. But as he drew also upon
America he was bound to acknowledge the
existence of Australia. lie did this by
printing some nondescript verses about Eng-
lish sparrows, begotten by Francis Adams
at Brisbane in the ’eighties ! : —a point which
suggests that more and more anthologies
are necessary for the instruction of critics
and makers of earlier anthologies, to teach
them what they don’t know. Howbeit, col-
lection or no collection, as one who has
listened much to Australian birds and poets,
I want to bear witness to a fruitful kin-
ship that promises to blossom in good time
into a very sweet thing.

tunate enough to find my MSit
with the celebration by the nwwnn’s
Society of the anniversary of Chatter .on.
birth. It is of that I would write.
In the newspaper of November Id I rea l
an announcement that the Ohatterton Socie y
would next day celebrate the anniversary
of the poet’s birth by holding a ceremony
before the monument in the churchyard o
St. Mary Redeliffe. I am afraid I allowed
the enthusiasm of my imagination sadly to
outrun the discretion of my experience, tor
with the idea of securing a good position in
the crowd I arrived at the appointed spot
an hour before time. Not a soul was m
sight; so I beguiled the period of waiting
by roaming once more through St. Mary
Redeliffe—“the fairest, goodliest and most
famous parish church in England, Queen
Elizabeth described it in 1574 with which
the Chattel-ton family had been connected tor
generations, Richard Philips, the poet s uncle,
having held the post of sexton. This, too,
is the church, founded probably towards the
end of the eleventh century, which the Wil-
liam Canynge of the Rowley MSS. largely
rebuilt, the lofty spire being partially de-
stroyed by lightning during the progress ot
the work (1446), the tower remaining in
its truncated state till 1872. _ Canynge—a
name still remembered in Bristol, and be-
stowed upon one of the public reserves
w-as, of course, an historical person, ye
Richest Marchant of ye towne of Bristow;
Afterwards chosen 5 times Mayor of ye saut
towne for ye good of ye Common Wealth ot
ye same,” as a movable wooden board placed
above the effigies of himself and his wife
quaintly declares. It was partly due to the
judicious use of his name that the youthful
forger contrived to cast a light of seeming
authenticity upon that remarkable series of
productions, of which the first to. arouse
attention was a prose account, published in
“Felix Farley’s Bristol Journal” in 1768, on
the occasiop of the opening of a new bridge,
and purporting to be the record in an ancient
manuscript of the opening of the old bridge,
and of which the remainder soon followed,
giving rise to that amazing romance ot
literature of whose brief, meteoric career
and tragically untimely end the whole world
knows.
At length, shortly after the appointed hour,
the ceremony advertised duly took place, and
a simple myrtle-wreath was placed upon
the monument by the president of the local
Cliatterton Society. There were present, of.
Bristol’s population of some 300,000 souls,
seven or eight ladies and gentlemen, of whom
all save another and myself were members
of the association. The cenotaph (though
there is a possibility it may be a somewhat
more intimate memorial to the star-crossed
genius it commemorates, for there exists a
pleasing and not. altogether improbable tradi-
tion that his body was brought by his mother
from its original place of interment in the
burial-ground of Shoe-lane Workhouse. Eon-
don, when the place was torn up shortly
after his death and converted into a market,
and was laid to rest once more within the
hounds of the church that had played so fate-
ful a part in his strange, eventful history)
is a lofty, pentagonal sandstone column, sur-
mounted by a full-length figure,_ dressed in
a long, skirt-like jacket and holding a. scroll.
On the first face appears the inscription:
“To the memory of Thomas Cliatterton.
Reader, judge not, if thou art a Christian ;
believe that he shall be judged by a superior
power—to that power alone lie is now
answerable. Erected by subscription a.d.
1840.” Other aspects set forth the verses
beginning “Sweet flower of hope,” by Cole-
ridge (in whose own history Bristol has a
significant role, for it was there that, along
with Southey and Lovell, he first lectured on
his ideal republic) ; some lines, the name
of the author of which I made out in the
already worn lettering as Rev. J. Eagle, and
short notes of various outstanding biographi-
cal details.
In Pile-street, literally within a stone’s
throw of St. Mary Redeliffe, stands the
school, in the dwelling adjoining which re-
; sided Chattel-ton’s father, the schoolteacher,
who died several months before the birth of
his son. The old front in recent years has
been extended towards the street; but the
original commemorative tablet is still pre-
served. It reads: “This House was erected
by Giles Malpas of St. Thomas Parifh, Gent,
for the ufe of the Mafter of this School,
a.d. 1741).” The house, of solid stone, is still
occupied, and by the courtesy of the tenants
we were permitted to make our way up the
narrow, winding stairs to the little, low room
in which, exactly 172 years before, was born
the first outstanding figure of the Romantic
revival in English letters. The outlook from
the window is probably much more restricted
than it was in earlier times, and it is quite
likely the young Cliatterton was able to
gaze therefrom upon the stately church which
was to become a motif so closely woven in
the fabric of his short life.
From the birthplace our little party re-
turned to St. Mary Redeliffe, to visit the
scene whose Cliatterton associations are
among the most romantic features of the
history of a city whose annals boast of
Cabot and the grand old “Marchauut Adven-
turers.” This is the famous muniment room,
a large hexagonal apartment situated above
the north porch, the latter a magnificent
piece of early decorated work. Here are
preserved three chests, including “William
Canynge’s Cofre,” which provided Chatterton
with the parchments which first suggested
to him the elaborate series of forgeries of
“young-eyed poesy, all deftly masked as
hoar antiquity.” The largest chest, the six
keys to which were lost before Chatterton’s
day, when it was broken open to extract
some papers, is now naturally much worn
and aged, but still holds stoutly together.
I could not resist the impulse to feel ex-
pectantly among the cracks, in the pious
hope there might still be lodged there some
stray scraps of precious manuscript. But
any such treasures have long, long been
removed; and I turned and left the room
well content to have touched the actual
chest which was the means of giving us
“Aella,” “Tlie Bristowe Tragedy,” and “The
Balade of Charitie * the last. Watts Dunton
has declared, “the most purely artistic work
perhaps of its time.”

Local Color
In the library of the British Museum
many absorbed persons bend over books or
manuscripts spread out on the tables, home
are merely reading; others, with stacks ot
books to one side, are making abstracts; still
others are engaged in translation. All w ork
in a soothing calm, and all are intent upon
their tasks. The great library, with its rich
store of literature from all ■ corners of the
earth, is, among many other things, the
home of “local color.” The withered-looking
old lady yonder, with spectacles on nose,
may be picking out the topographical
features of some little-known land to serve
as the background of young Mr. knocks
great novel of adventure. She feeds per-
haps half a dozen writers with the scenic
properties that back up their romances, and
thus earns a humble but sufficient income.
As a rule the material she furnishes is
fairly accurate, but frequently it undergoes
strange metamorphoses in passing through
the imaginative novelist’s mind. It thus
comes about that we read of the Southern
Cross flaming in Austral skies,” as though
our unobtrusive constellation were an awe-
inspiring pyrotechnic display. Ix>cal coloi
of this kind passes muster with the great
body of novel-readers who have no precise
knowledge of the supposed environment, but
here and there the traveller, or the resident
in the country described, finds in it a fund
of amusement the author did not set out to
provide. Only the most skilful pen can use
this second-hand material with such vrai-
semblance as to deceive the local and in-
formed reader.
Sir Harry Johnston, in the course ot an
honorable career in the service of his country
—he was one of those pro-consuls who admin-
ister the outlying parts of the Empire—has
travelled far, been a mighty hunter, and
written brilliantly on many subjects. On
his retirement he took to the lighter literary
occupation of the novelist, and at once struck
an original vein. He picked up Dickens s
“Dombey and Son” where the author had
laid it down, and in “The Gay-Dombeys”
we followed the further fortunes of the
family in a very readable volume. He did
the same with Bernard Shaw’s “Mrs. War-
ren’s Profession.” Followed other works of
fiction from the pen of a versatile and gifted
man. In Relations (Cliatto and Windusl
Sir Harry appears, however, to have reached
the end of his tether. Possibly the much-
travelled man may have made a meteoric
passage through Australia at. some time ot
his crowded life; but one visions the old
lady of the British Museum behind the story.
Rupert Cuthbertson, the son of a canon,
came to Australia in the ’eighties and made
a fortune in mining. Having done so, he
left Northern Queensland and moved to
Sydney, the centre of social life. At that
time the Governor happened to be the Earl
of Tipperary, an impoverished peer disap-
pointed at discovering that there was very
little opportunity of saving anything out of
his salary. Rupert speedily got into the
Government House set, and, in view of Tip-
perary’s dejection, the young man’s offer to
settle twenty thousand pounds on the charm-
ing Lady Adeliza Parkyns, the peer’s
daughter, on the day of her marriage with
Rupert, was at once accepted. They were
married, and went to spend their honeymoon
at Cowan gerong. Adeliza discovered a
French maid, and with equal good fortune
Rupert ran to ground a paragon of a man-
servant —“a handy man who turned his hand
to anything: valeting, using a pickaxe,
searching for gold, cooking an omelette or a
damper, or brushing clothes and cleaning
guns.” As all readers of Australian litera-
ture know, such men and maids are to be
picked up every day in our glorious country.
Arrived at Cowangerong, they left their be-
longings and followers at the local hotel
and went up into a high place and there
beheld “table-topped mountain ridges, forested
nearly to the topmost edge—a scented forest,
it seemed, aromatic, no doubt, like the wood-
lands immediately below 7 them, lazily stirred
to remit its perfumes by a gentle, westward
wind. “This is altogether delightful, Rupy.’
said Adeliza —‘may I call you that?’ ” And
she might. Soon the lovers move on, and
Rupert talks instructively to Adeliza about
distributional botany:
“Here,” he remarked (plucking a warratah),
“here! This is what they call the ‘native tulip.’
Let me pin it. Got a pin? No? Well, I’ve
one somewhere in my 1ape1.... The ‘native tulip!
No more of a tulip than I am; but, then, most of
Australia was opened up and named by ignorant
people, ignorant of botany or zoology.”
This business, described as “love dal-
liance,” was rudely interrupted by a party
of “over-healthy young men” who had been
out shooting. “ ‘What on earth can they he
firing at in these quiet, lonely wilds ?’ in-
quired Adeliza. ‘Can’t say, I am sure,
replied Rupert. ‘There is very little in the
way of wild creatures in this forest, except
birds. It is a great pity; the native white
Australians are so indiscriminatingly blood-
thirsty.’ ” However, the over-healthy young
men were informed at the hotel of the social
status of the bride and bridegroom, and on
the return of the couple their reception was
“as nearly respectful as is possible in Austra-
lia, where between whites there is nothing
approaching subservience.” In the end
Rupert became reconciled to the young men,
and delivered two lectures to them. It is
but fair to this well-meaning gentleman to
state that he impressed oil the lads the wrong
they were doing in wmntonly destroying the
curious and beautiful fauna of Australia.
The rest of the honeymoon was devoted to
visiting mines.
The young couple then voyaged to Eng-
land, and for some years led a domestic
life of the orthodox Victorian type. Then
Rupert returned to Australia to look after
his mining interests. These settled, he went
off on an adventurous tour to locate some
wonderful mineral discoveries confided to him
by “a broken-up, broken-down, battered type
of pioneer,” taking with them an aboriginal
named Kunapippi. Of Kunapippi it is re-
lated that with some little difficulty he was
induced to address his master as “Sail.”
After rough experiences in the discovery
of great riches, Rupert returned from the
mallee scrub to be tempted by an Australian
girl. Now, even Galahad is human. “He
had begun to think of her too often; to
recall the look of her rounded arms when she
was in the nearest approach to evening-dress
that her life —out in the bush and always
haunted by mosquitoes permitted. Her
eyes were her best feature; her complexion
a little too tanned for European fastidious-
ness.”
So further adventures followed before
Itupy was restored to the arms of faith-
ful Adeliza. The story then plunges into
those domestic concerns with which the great
traveller is so familiar. The old lady in
the Museum can take off her spectacles,
adjust her hat aud make ready to return
home. No more local color needed to-day.
thank you.

The “Beachcomber” Again
A. 11. Chisholm has performed the last
rites for E. .1. Banfield in collecting his
literary remains. Last Leaves from Dunk
Island (Angus and Robertson) is composed
for the most part of fugitive essays without
the connecting link of romantic adventuring
that gave “The Confessions of a Beach-
comber” when it first appeared in 1908 such
an instant vogue. Most of us who read that
fascinating story felt a momentary distaste
for trams, trains, time-books and desk-calen-
dars ; long vistas opened up under our feet,
seeming to lead toward leisurely havens
where, if we only had the resolution to make
the journey, would be found surcease from
care. Some even made the trip ; and the
hospitable Banfield and his wife were called
upon to provide board and lodging for
amateur beachcombers from all parts of the
world. Some of them found the life too
hard, and others found it extremely dull;
and all brought with them the manacles of
their several temperaments. None had the
real secret of the pioneer's success, which
was that in turning his back on the world
of men he had found another which satisfied
his nature even more.
In the first part of the present book Ban-
field shows how personal to him that new
world was. In 1918 a cyclone took Dunk
Island in its path, cutting Banfield’s luxuriant
Eden almost out of existence. A man of
poorer fibre would have given up the tight
and set out to find another refuge; but
long residence in the tropics had warned him
of the strength of Nature’s recuperative
powers. He waited, and presently fresh
growth began to spring up out of the ugly
ruin; the sun penetrated into the lower
storeys of the jungle and liberated species
that had been submerged for many vegetable
generations; new varieties appeared, and in
a few years the island was once more green
under a flora different in many interesting
details from the old. Banfield brought all
his fine faculty of observation to bear on
the stages of this resurrection, and the record
of it stands in this book as the last big
effort , of his pen.
The final chapter of this little epic of
Australia’s north sounds a dramatic note:
On the sth of June, 1923, the small steamer Innis-
fail was passing- between Dunk Island and the coast
of Northern Queensland, when the captain noticed
a figure waving from the island beach. Interpreting-
the signal as a greeting-, he merely waved a response.
Then, as the vessel proceeded, the figure on the beach
collapsed. At once the Innisfail was stopped and
a party went to investigate.
The signaller was Mrs. Banfield, who had
been alone with her dead husband for three
days. So ended an idyll that had lasted for a
quarter of a century.

A Satchel of Books
Humphry Clinker, by Tobias Smollett (Oxford
University Press). A clearly-prmted and well-
produced pocket edition.
The Malaret Mystery, by Olga Hastley (Methuen).
A yarn put into the mouth of a medical man who
brightens up the dramatic side of a fair detective
story with humor.
The Seven Sleepers, by Francis Seeding (Hutchin-
son). The author moves on an ocean of excitement
rising from crest to crest of sensation. The plot is
well constructed, the characters are painted in with
a broad brush, and the ending is unexpected. A
quite good book of its kind.
The Sloane Square Mystery , by Herbert Adams
(Methuen). The increasing output of mystery and
detective stories seems to indicate a popular demand
for this class of fiction. It is the swing of the
pendulum from the novel of character to the novel of
plot, having in it the lure of the puzzle and the
stimulus of suspense. Herbert Adams is a nrst-
rafe craftsman in this type of literary job, and
from the discovery of the body to the solution ot
ffte mvstery doesn’t leave the trail for an instant.
Life and You, by C. Lewis Hind (John Lane).
This is a new series of essays—the old one appeared
under the title of “Life and I.” The story of how
the child Julius Caesar, who conquered by love and
not by a sword, came into the household of the
writer has been told in the previous volume. The
present one carries him on, and in doing so enter-
tains the reader with the thought and wit of a well-
furnished mind and a sympathetic nature.
The Braw Bailie, by J. J. Bell (John Castle). It
is now many years since “Wee Macgregor” won
success for its author, and it is not given to many
writers of fiction to reap a succession of such boun-
teous harvests. This volume holds a number of short
stories, complete in themselves and yet all illus-
trative of the good Bailie Blue’s character.. . rhej
are full of that “pawky” humor characteristic of
the race libelled by Dr. Johnson, and are warmed by
a quiet, genial sentiment.

“Spero”: “Ratio” is wrong in his inference (B.
5/11/’25) that Kangaroo Island was expected to
provide a site for the capital of the Wakefield
Colony in South Australia. There has recently been
found in the Record Office, London, a letter from
Charles Sturt (17/2/’34) advocating, on information
supplied by the expedition of the ill-fated Colet
Barker, a capital almost exactly where Port Adel-
aide is situated to-day. Surveyor-General Light was
instructed by the South Australian Commissioners
that “the district between Gulf St. Vincent and the
Murray, provided a good harbor could be found,
appeared to combine the required advantages in the
highest degree,” and subsequent ships were ordered
to touch at Kangaroo Island and to proceed to that
port, as it had been selected for the site of the
first town. Light had been disposed to select this
area before he reached South Australia owing to its
certain rainfall from the ranges and its command
of the Murray. He examined it at once, and sent
the first large batch of Wakefield immigrants in the
Africaind to Glenelg, in the Adelaide plains, directly
they arrived. Although he visited Port Lincoln as
instructed, his choice never wavered. The settle-
ment on Kangaroo Island was merely a whaling
station founded by the South Australian Co. through
the misleading information supplied 'by Captain
Sutherland, who had been there in 1819. The official
founders of (he colony preferred the advice of Sturt,
and sent Light to flic one area which at that time
■could provide success.

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY.
Tine Company is being formed (inter alia ) for the purpose of acquiring as a going
concern, as and from Ist October, 1925, the whole of the plant, stock-in-trade and good-
will of the business carried on for the past four years by Wu G. Bailey, under the name
of “Black and White Cab Company.”
The Vendor agrees to pay all liabilities up to Ist October, 1925.
This business, which has been conducted on the lines of similar concerns in Mel-
bourne, Chicago and New York, is to be further developed. Mr. Bailey’s experience,
gained in the service of these institutions in America, will be at the disposal of the Com-
pany, under agreement, and his confidence in the venture is expressed by his acceptance
of shares, in full consideration of the assets bt-ing transferred to the Company.
NEW FLEET EQUIPMENT.
It is proposed to increase the present fleet of twelve cabs by purchasing an addi-
tional 90 cabs of Renault manufacture. These cabs will be equipped with the latest
type of Taximeter, that automatically prints a receipt (the same as the National Cash
Register), which is tendered to the passenger at the termination of the journey The
amount of the fare will' be registered in the interior of the cab, and will be always
visible to the passenger.
The efficiency of Renault cars is so well known throughout the world that there
is no need to enlarge upon it here, except to mention that the upkeep and runnin*’
expenses of these cars is extremely light, and they have a longer life than other makes;
hence, by obtaining this make of car, the expenses of the Company should more than
favorably compare with those of other Taxi-cab Companies.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE.
It is proposed to apply the sum of £OO,OOO (to be raised under this Prosneetn
in the following manner p ■

He glared at me with baleful eye;
His body writhed in agony.
The air grew wretched with his cry:

No God there was to know or see
In that grim hour, nor hear him cry:
“O God, be merciful to me!

Nor God nor man to hear him cry;

Other Little Ships.
“Now the earth is a ship in space.”
We own a little ship down here,
But a little ship, I fear,
Sailing through the blue;
We’re the jolly crew,
Skilful with the ropes and gear.
When above I glance and gaze,
Looking at the noble maze—
Nebula and shining sphere—
How I’d like to know,
In this royal show,
Are there other ships out here?
Are there other ships out there,
Managed by a crowd who dare?
Spinning with a crew
(Same as me and you),
Spinning to I don't know where?
Saturn with his noble rings
Is he not a star of kings?
Is he not a pageant rare?
Is he just a stai-,
Much as others are,
Or a little ship
On a little trip,
Just a little ship out there?
Signalling the craft out there,
Wouldn’t it be fine out there,
Could we only know
Other vessels go
Freighted with a cargo rare,
Managed by a human crew,
Running to a compass true,
Making for the deep
Where the mighty sleep
Ploughing with a shining share —
Could we only feel
Many a friendly keel
Cuts away the seas out there?
Must be other ships out there;
Surely there is room to spare,
Surely there is laughter
Under roof and rafter
Blended with a voice of prayer!
Let the little earth take cheer;
All is not of darkness sheer.
Other little caravels
Journey to the sound of bells,
Voyage through the viewless air.
Other crews are furling sails,
Other crews are fighting gales,
Full of hope and joy and care
In the bonny starry ships
On their day and nightly trips,
In the little ships out there!

THE BRIDGE THAT IS LIABLE TO
BREAK.
The finish of the most unsatisfactory strike
in the history of Australian industrial trouble
should not be the end of our consideration
of the problem of overseas traffic. I he strike
of the British seamen in Commonwealth
ports was hopeless from the first, because
it was evident that the shipping companies,
with obligations all round the Sevc-n Seas,
could not afford to yield to the demands of
one section of their employees. On the other
hand, it is still quite an open question
whether British companies are wise in lower-
ing the wage standard to meet foreign com-
petition. High-priced efficiency is generally
a profitable article, and one of which Bri-
tain has often had almost a monopoly. It
is hard to forget John Hawkins’s first re-
form of the Navy in Queen Elizabeth’s
time, when he nearly doubled the wages,
reduced the numbers of the crews by more
than a third, and actually made the fleet
which defeated the Armada a less expensive
concern than the fleet which the Armada
might have defeated. The wages were higher,
the food better, the conditions cleaner, the
ships better found ; yet the total bill was
less. In any case, the recent strike cost
the shipowners £2,000,000, which would re-
present a payment of an extra £1 a month
to 5000 seamen for more than 33 years; so
the winning of the strike has not put the
companies in any better position in relation
to foreign vessels and the general world-
competition for cargoes. Still, had the strike
loss amounted to ten times the sum the ship-
owners could not have given in. They were
attacked in such a way that there could
be no question of yielding. Meantime Aus-
tralia was suffering loss also —loss of a kind
which is almost impossible to calculate on
a money basis; and now that the strike is
over we are still the losers in that a serious
doubt remains as to the security of our
overseas trade. We are like a district whose
only outlet to the world is by means of a
bridge which has been declared unsafe. Of
that bridge we have at present no control
whatever. It has broken down once; and in
spite of the assurance that the seamen have
learned their lesson, there is no guarantee
that it will not break down again.
* * * #
The history of the Commonwealth shipping
line does not suggest that the remedy lies in
building a larger bridge from our own end;
for, unfortunately, the human material
necessary for the support of such a bridge is
no more definitely reliable under Australian
control than when in the hands of overseas
companies. In either case our trade is largely
at the mercy of a certain class of labor which
lias been inclined to diminish rather than
increase in all British lands. The old salt,
who with all his faults and all the bad treat-
ment he received was still a staunch pillar of
ocean trade, has almost disappeared. The
new seaman is of a different type and all
the old spirit has gone. A voyage is no
longer a more or less romantic adventure,
but a plain job of a not specially attractive
kind. It is some time since the last boy
with dreams of becoming an admiral left
his father’s hay-paddock and ran away to
sea; and it is not at all possible to read
the signs of salt in the rolling gait of the
man who now steps ashore. A ship has
become a machine; the engine-room has
enlarged itself to include the whole vessel;
and the conditions are not as good as those
of the factory where work of a like kind is
performed. To believe that the sea as an
occupation will be more and more sought by
stalwarts of our race in the future years is
to deny all the signs of the times. About
the best that can be hoped for is to main-
tain the restless, dissatisfied, grumbling
crews at their present level without allow-
ing things to become any worse. Bright,
alert crews springing to their work and
singing sea-chanties in the spirit of those
who once danced round with the capstan bars
are now only museum specimens, like the
roaring mate and the raging boatswain. At
the best the trend of things may be towards
the still more mechanical ship with real
mechanics for seamen —a smaller number ot
more highly-paid men doing better work. But
all such advances are likely to keep their
proportion to things ashore. Even to-day
the skipper and the first engineer arc gener-
ally quite as good grumblers as the rank
and file of the crew; and there are no more
indications of a stampede to join the ranks
of the sea’s aristocracy than of a fierce
struggle to secure the lower jobs. So the
bridge between Australia and Europe must
always be shaky, and there must always
remain the danger of a temporary collapse.
* * * *
Such being the position, our job should
be to make the best of it. A country which
is content simply to supply the raw materials
to other lands for their advancing manufac-
tures must always be at the mercy of those
who handle the ships. Australia sends away
a great variety of things which require much
cargo-space, and among those exports one of
the largest is dirt. Dirt is the chief con-
stituent of ores sent unsmelted, of wool
shipped in the grease, and of many other raw
products; in a general way the percentage
of exported dirt is much too high in every
class of goods not manufactured to a finish
on our own shores. To eliminate the need
for shipping to carry our exports of dirt
is to enormously decrease our dependence
upon the fickle will of those who man the
ocean-going ships. But further saving of
cargo-space can easily be made. Much of
our raw material we are still in the habit
of sending to the other side of the world to
be manufactured and shipped back again as
the entirely new product of another country.
By doing the manufacturing in Australia we
save space on the ships, and are still less de-
pendent on that shaky bridge of seamen s
goodwill between land and land. There is
no reason at all why Australia should not
be almost entirely self-contained. With our
mineral wealth and our range of climate there
is not a world product of any importance
which actually requires to be imported. As a
complete world within a world, we could be
entirely independent. Admitting, however,
that such an arrangement might not be. alto-
gether desirable, there can be no mistake
about the fact that we could make our-
selves in all essentials independent of ship-
ping conditions. If our exports were all
in the fully-manufactured state the worst
breaking-down of the bridge could do us little
real harm. Manufactured articles are in
almost every instance the easiest to handle
and store, ‘if some of the Roman-manufac-
tured glass had been held up by si shipping
strike and stored at Ostia in a.d. 85 it would
not only pay for shipping to-day, but would
probably pav interest. Nobody expects a
shipping strike to last 19 centuries, but
a manufacturing country is fairly safe how-
ever long it lasts. A raw-material country is
entirely at the mercy of shipping: the bridge
of ships between Australia and Europe has
been proved to be unsafe. The clear infer-
ence is that Australia can no longer afford
to be a raw-material country, but must turn
more resolutely to manufactures as the first
line of defence of its civilised life.
SEVEN MONTHS OF N.S.W. LABOR
GOVERNMENT.
The N.S.W. Labor Government, which came
into office after a confused election at which
its opponents contrived to beat themselves,
goes on its noisy, blundering way. Having
won 46 of the 90 Assembly seats, though it
polled 17,250 fewer than half the effective
votes, it announced on meeting Parliament
that it had received “a full and unequivocal
mandate,” and has acted ever since as if a
majority of two members and a minority of
17,250 votes constituted a license to do what-
ever folly or malevolence might suggest, from
refusing the Commonwealth Government the
use of the State police to bludgeoning vicious
legislation through the Lower House without
debate. One of the firstfruits of the “man-
date” was a bill raising the Assemblyman’s
salary from £6OO p.a. to £875 and bestowing
substantial increases on Ministers and
officials of both Houses. The total addition
to the cost of government is £28,560 p.a. This
daring raid on the public purse was not even
hinted at in the Labor policy speech, and the
author of that speech expressly declared that
“when the electors vote for Labor candidates
they vote for what is here proposed, and not
for anything else, as far as the next Parlia-
ment is concerned.” The spirit in which the
alleged “mandate” is interpreted is perfectly
expressed in the Salary Grab Act.
# * * *
The measure referred to, rotten as it is.
represents the party’s solitary legislative suc-
cess during the session. Practically every
other Government bill on which judgment
has been pronounced has been either vitally
amended or rejected by the Leg. Council.
The 44-hour week proposal, which was to
have been of general application, was altered
by the exclusion of rural workers, the Gov-
ernment being anxious to help Federal Labor
candidates to get the farmer’s vote. Re-
jection was the fate of the measures abolish-
ing capital punishment, extending the local-
government franchise to nomads and the
like, and validating the degradation of rail-
waymen who did not strike when the sub-
marines were doing their worst in 1917, the
said degradation having been declared ille.gal
by an Equity Court Judge. After the first
of these bills was fired out the Government
issued terrible threats against the nominee
chamber, but it dropped the subject as sud-
denly as it abandoned the idea of “testing
the constitutionality” of the proceedings
against Walsh and Johanson, and it now
takes the mangling of its legislation lying
down. Much of that legislation. has been
forced through an uncomprehending House
by persistent abuse of the gag, a method of
conducting business which gives the Council
an excuse for interfering, since the delibera-
tive side of the Assembly’s functions is re-
duced to a farce. The Workers’ Compensa-
tion Bill is a ease in point.. That compli-
cated piece of legislation contains 69 clauses,
60 of which were passed, in spite of the
Opposition’s protest, without discussion.
* * # *
Arriving at the Treasury before the end of
the financial year. Premier Lang converted
an anticipated surplus into a deficit by debit-
ing consolidated revenue with items amount-
ing to £950,800, which, he contended, should
have been debited before. He also forced
the resignations of Director of Finance
Stevens and Agent-General Cocks, previ-
ously Treasurer. His Budget speech was
largely devoted to a defence of these “adjust-
ments,” as he calls them, and an attack on
Cocks. It took him so much time to pre-
pare his indictment of Cocks (whom he
quoted as a trustworthy financial adviser
when he tried to get home in a childish
fashion on Bruce) that he did not introduce
his Budget till Dec. 3, when nearly half the
year’s expenditure had gone. It would have
been a lot more helpful if he had introduced
the Budget in August or September and dealt
with Cocks in the consequent debate—or,
better still, when Cocks was present to de-
fend himself. One of the “illicit practices”
imputed to the ex-Treasurer was failure to
pay £345,000 into the State Superannuation
Fund in 1922-23. It is not alleged that the
ex-Treasurer pinched the money or that the
Superannuation Fund became insolvent be-
cause the £384,000 was not contributed, and
there is known to be a difference of
opinion among financiers as to whether
Governments should pay fixed annual
amounts into superannuation funds or meet
liabilities as they arise; so Cocks will
probably be able to vindicate himself.
Another allegation is that when the Com-
monwealth Government presented a bill for
£380,000. the difference between actual and
“tentative” rates of interest on £7,400,000
borrowed by N. S. Wales in 1914-15, Cocks
arranged to pay £lOO,OOO down and the bal-
ance by instalments instead of weighing in
with the whole £3So,ooo.in 1923-24. A gen-
erous critic would have acknowledged that,
in addition to this old war-time obligation,
the harassed Cocks had to provide £920,000
out of revenue in consequence of the Dooley-
Lang Government guaranteeing an excessive
price for wheat; but Lang is not a generous
critic. Neither is he a financier of the
George Turner sort, as witness his ignoble
“arguments” in favor of sponging on the Old
Man for sand-shifting money and so forth:
It would be practically impossible to construct
public works out of revenue. Therefore, if loans are
not raised the development of the State would re-
main at a standstill. Unemployment would eventu-
ate and assume large proportions. If the State is
to progress, then loans must be raised with a conse-
quential annual increase in the public debt.
* * * *
In the Treasurer’s brief references to 1925-
26 finance, a surplus of £14,000 is promised,
together with a scheme of so-called widows’
pensions, the raising of the income-tax
exemption from £250 to £3OO, and several
small abatements. It would be wiser to re-
duce the rates than increase the exemption,
for it is a bad thing to let young fellows
grow up with the idea that the income-tax
is no coucern of theirs. Many single men
earning from £4 ss. to £5 15s. p.w. are better
able to pay tax than married men on the
£lO or £l2 or even £l5 mark. However, con-
sidering Lang’s past performances in the
taxation line—in 1920-21 he piled on in-
creases higher in nearly every case than the
Victorian rates —taxpayers may well be
thankful for small mercies. It is not much
of a Budget; but, then, it is not much of a
Government. Since the stunning shock of
the Federal election a section of the Ministry
has been clamoring for the expulsion of the
Red influences, whose very existence was de-
nied only a few weeks ago. Another section
has taken the Red side of the argument,
either because it is Red itself or because it
would be lost without Red support. The Labor
paper of which Lang and Willis are direc-
tors has also come to light with a story that
the Nationalists have raised £20,000 With
which to bribe “several” Labor members,
and the narrative is alleged to have origi-
nated with “a certain Minister.” These
edifying incidents have given rise to an
impression that there will presently be a
party split, leading to the downfall of the
Government and an appeal to the country
about the .middle of next year. The cement
of self-interest may, however, be expected
to keep the factions from flying apart. The
authors of the Salary Grab Act may indulge
their taste for quarrelling among them-
selves, but they will move heaven and earth
to avoid going to the country, in which
their party was 17,250 votes behind in May
and 80,000 in November. A reconstruction
of the Ministry with some genial neutral
like Mutch or Cann as Premier is much
more probable than the secession of a dis-
satisfied group. The present Premier, who
is industrious in his fashion, but humorless,
self-sufficient and not always in a good
temper, is getting on the public’s nerves.
A MAN ON A WINDY HILL.
It was a simple little ceremony performed
at a pretty red-painted shrine under a
crooked cryptomeria that clawed desperately
at a wind-swept hill in an endeavor not to
be blown into the Sea of Japan. The de-
votee, clad in a grey kimono, sandals and
a billycock hat, and accompanied by a small
boy in a figured shirt and a naval cap, pulled
at a sort of bell-rope and then clapped his
hands. Some millions of viewless ancestors
rushed to attend the summons. Some of
them had doubtless fallen at the Yalu, at
Tsushima or the taking of Tsingtao from
the Germans; some might have been amongst
the 700 massacred by the Russians at Niko-
laevsk; some might have died of malaria in
Formosa or the new mandated islands, or
given their lives for the Emperor in Korea,
Manchuria, Sakhalien and other corners of
the astounding empire which Japan has
carved out of a reluctant world in the last
20 years. Many, doubtless, had died miser-
ably of phthisis or over-work in the ship-
building yards of Kobe or the factories of
Osaka; but they, too, had served the Em-
peror in helping Japan to grow strong enough
to hold off the sacrilegious foreigner. Their
pious descendant stood with arms uplifted,
his incongruous headgear pushed back on
his head, while he absorbed the waves of
spiritual energy emanating from the shrine ;
then, smiling gently, he clapped his palms
again and, taking the attentive small boy
by the hand, went down the hill. If was an
impressive little sdance that even the Euro-
pean hat had failed to ruin, and in its sim-
plicity stood out vividly against the com-
plicated uproar that is modern Japan.
That uproar lias become louder and more
ominous than ever lately. Last year the
not very fertile collection of islands belong-
ing to his Majesty YosHiiUTO was called
upon to support nearly a million extra
stomachs; and as the price of the national
dish lias recently soared, some of the stom-
achs have had to go rather empty. In Tokio
the difficulty of filling them has become so
acute that wives and children are stated to
have been disposed of by their desperate sup-
porters for a cup of sake or a bowl of rice;
a drug in the market, their monetary value
is less than twopence. Yoshiwara proprietors
report a rush of applications for admission,
and private enterprise in the social evil is
stated to be on the increase. The Proletarian
Society, a brand-new organisation that admits
even the outcast eta to its councils, is mould-
ing the 500,000 unemployed into a union
for the purpose of extracting the dole from
a not overflowing Treasury. The Govern-
ment the other day deferred to popular press-
ure by recognising trades unions, and the
movement grew, like everything else in
Japan, almost to full size overnight. Its leaders
propose shortly to call a conference of Asiatic
labor at Shanghai. The European working-
man, they say, is drifting towards Russia
and the Red Internationale, and Mr. Bunji
Suzuki, president of the Japan Federation
of Labor, proposes as a counter-irritant that
Nippon should take the lead in forming
a Colored Internationale. The recent
treaty with the Soviet has attracted to Japan
a swarm of Bolshevik agents intent on de-
stroying the Constitution of the country with
which their Government is in alliance, and
although the visitors go about ringed round
with the Mikado’s police, their alluring doc-
trine is percolating down to the lower orders
that sweat and moil for 70 to 80 hours a
week, for tenpence to a shilling a day, in
the toils of an industrial system which the
Japanese manufacturer imagines he has bor-
rowed from the West. The shingle and the
Eton cut are displacing the cheap, beautiful,
insanitary habit of doing the hair up for
a month or a year, and the modern Japanese
flapper dances to broadcasted jazz in the
arms of her dance-partner nightly, while the
Navy and Army are so unpopular that sol-
diers and sailors are unable to find a suffi-
ciency of wives. Pacificism is abroad in a
modest way, and its latest exponent, just
returned from a tour of the> peacefully-inclined
outside world, is using his uninfluential voice
to obtain the total disbandment of the army
and the sinking of the entire fleet. On its
part, the Navy is discontented at the non-
fulfilment of a huge programme of replace-
ments, and fresh building involving an expen-
diture of 800,000,000 yen. The Japanese
Fascist]' have opened branches.
Politics reflect the general restiveness, and
the Seiyukai. the Honto and other Parlia-
mentary parties have recently performed
a series of intricate manoeuvres for
the delectation of the people, the con-
clusion of the play being the usual
procession for further instructions to the
Genro, now represented by one old and de-
crepit statesman who owes his position as
arbiter to the fact that he, and he alone,
commands the ear of the awful and omni-
potent throne. Meantime, the birth-control


movement, which ever since the visit of its
American apostle, Mrs. Sanger, has been
gaining ground, is being vigorously stamped
oil by the police, the Government holding
that the practice is impious and deleterious
to the race, while the publicists aver that
it is the duty of other countries to provide
the pasture for the millions of extra
stomachs.
At present two schools of thought are
struggling for control of the country’s steer-
ing-gear. One advocates what is euphemis-
tically termed a vigorous foreign policy, and
looks first towards China, Manchuria and
Siberia for its fulfilment; the other counsels
social reform and the uplifting of the prole-
tariat. The latter school gained a mild vic-
tory the other day when the Navy was in-
duced to halve its demands for the coming
year. . . .
Some observers, surveying the surprising
ferment that half a century of contact with
the West has made of the land of the geisha
and the tea ceremony, maintain, as was
maintained of Germany in 1914, that Japan
has mislaid the oid ideals of unquestioning
service, of bushido, beyond recall ; but it is
possible they over-rate surface indications.
It still may be that, like the ancestor-wor-
shipper on the windy hill, the Emperor has
only to clap his deified hands for the whole
nation to attend the call.

Stabilised Politics in Maoriland.
Last month’s general elections in Maoriland,
while they have altered nothing, have at
least made it clear that nothing is likely
to he altered so long as the country remains
prosperous • and everybody, including the
politicians, lias heaved a sigh of relief and
returned to the consideration of those things
that really matter, such as beer, business or
spotting the winners. The Dominion has
few strings to its bow, commercially speak-
ing, and its politics, like its commerce, are
largely conditioned by the prices ruling for
butter, meat and wool on the London mar-
ket, and by the readiness or otherwise of
Uncle Bull to make advances that will
keep the trading balance on the comfortable
side. Prices have lately been remunerative
and money fairly plentiful. Such errors as
the Reform Government lias made have been
outweighed in the estimation of those most
affected by its reputation for conseiwatism;
and the death of W. F. Massey has been
made to appear by the Reform press as
the breaking of a last link with conser-
vatism, so that the average Maorilander,
who is anything but a conservative, has
been encouraged to vote the Government
ticket. Luck always favors a conservative
or near-conservative party in a three-
cornered election on the lirst-past-the-post
principle, since Progressives are always “by
schisms rent asunder,” and the rule was
followed On this occasion. Aitliougn tne
aggregate of votes cast in favor of the Re-
formers was not very much greater than
that in 1922—-the party is still several
thousands of votes short of having a majority
in the country—they go back with a hand-
some Parliamentary majority. They came
back from the election of 1922 with only 98
members out of 80, retaining office. by put-
ting an Independent, Statiiam, into the
Speaker’s chair and accepting the allegiance
of two gentlemen who were elected as
Liberals. These two did not contest the last
election, and have been elevated to the
Council for their kindness. But nobody
worries very much about such little trans-
actions, since the dividing lines between
Reformers and Liberals have long been ex-
tremely blurred. Coates, the Prime Minis-
ter, thought he was a Liberal when he went
into Parliament, and only found out his
mistake when Massey wanted three votes
to keep the Government in office. The fact
that he is the first native-born to become
head of the Government was worked for all
it was worth during the last election —the
party’s funds were expended right royally
on poster and newspaper advertising—and
the result has exceeded all expectations.
“Gordon,” as his friends call him, goes back
as leader of a party of 55 or 56 members;
the Liberals, who made the silly blunder
of changing thir party’s name to “Nation-
alist” on the eve of the election, are reduced
to a dozen, losing 11 seats; and the Labor
Party, which, like its Australian pro-
totype, tried to run with the hare of Com-
munism while hunting with the hounds of
Constitutionalism, also suffered loss, return-
ing with about the same number of seats
as the Liberals. Coates, if he plays his cards
right, has now an opportunity to absorb the
Liberals and found a broad-based party; but
his capacity for wise leadership is still un-
proven, and rumor connects him with an
intention to revert to quinquennial Parlia-
ments and to make the liquor referendums
less frequent than they are at present.
Such steps, however welcome to many,
would not endear him to the surviving fol-
lowers of Seddon. Apart from that aspect,
Coates’s most serious handicap is that he
is the leader of a party whose nucleus is
purely agrarian, and whose most influential
supporters are large landowners. An intelli-
gent tariff policy and such other legitimate
encouragement as might be given to manu-
factures is not likely to come from such a
source, and the Shivery Isles are, therefore,
likely to continue almost entirely dependent
upon Tooley-street, Coleman-street, Smithfield
and Throgmorton streets for their means of
livelihood. To the extent to which it is a
class party the Reform party lacks the
elements that make for permanence. Coates
may either broaden it or narrow it.
#
Widows’ Pensions and Insurance.
Bavin, the N.S.W. Opposition leader, de-
bating Lang’s widows’ pensions scheme,
quarrelled with the principle of such State
subsidies, remarking that the giving of money
out of Government coffers “never would solve
any economic problem and tended to retard
the proper scientific treatment .of the sub-
ject.” He went on to argue that the workers
should make provision for their own widows
and orphans by means of insurance contri-
butions, admitting that higher wages would
have to be paid before such a system could
be applied to people on the basic wage.
Bavin’s plan is open to as many economic
objections as Lang’s. Britain’s famous un-
employed dole system is tlie natural clnld
of a compulsory industrial insurance scheme,
based, on contributions from both employers
and employed. It broke down badly under
the strain of the end-of-the-war readjustment
and has been continued as an almost wholly
State-subsidised institution, intensifying the
trade depression that makes it expedient, the
problem before anyone who wants to settle
such questions in a purely scientific way is
to devise a plan whereby, without placing
any additional burden on industry or on the
community, svich as higher wages or insur-
ance subsidies or increased taxation, working
folk may : be enabled to pay premiums on
an all-round insurance policy—a policy which
covers them and their dependants against
every risk. It can’t be done. The compromise ot
raising wages in order to get it halt-done
suffers under the disability that it either
means paying men and women without de-
pendants more than they are worth m order
to provide for those who have dependants to
provide for, or giving employers a hrst-class
economic reason for not employing people
with dependants. Direct State endowment ot
children, old folk and incapacitated people is
preferable to monkeying with the basic wage.
Where the Cold Country went wrong in its
social remedies was in paying people tor
idleness. It would have been better to set
them digging holes and filling them up again.
The British Seaman’s Job.
Dear Bulletin, —The Australian who
butted in and encouraged a British sea-
men’s strike without knowing what British
maritime conditions are was no friend ot
the seamen —he was simply pushing the
unfortunate fellows into a ring where they
were bound to be licked. Even at the time
when sailing-ships Vastly predominated, the
supply of men chronically exceeded the de.
mand. This applied to both ends of a ship .;
to officers as well as able seamen, to the
former to such an extent that at Liverpool
there was a saying that if an A.L. wished
to get from the Sailors’ Hope to one o-
the docks in a hurry he could jump on the
back of. a second mate, who would be glad
to carry him there for sixpence. Ann I
have seen the courtyard of Cardiff Shipping
Office literally packed with men waving
their discharges and imploring the master
of a Nova Scotian full-rigger for a voyage
to Santos, eVen though it was then known
to seamen as “the white-man s grave.
Owing to this over-supply of hands, strikes
usually terminated disastrously. I remem-
ber when a shipowners’ federation came into
existence after an unsuccessful strike (ISUU)
which resulted in reduction of the then
ruling wages of about £3 per month in sail.
It became thereafter virtually impossible
for a seaman to obtain a berth in a British
ship without a “federation ticket,” which
was issued gratis upon application. There
was literally- a rush for these permits, and
a proportion of their holders actually im-
agined it was some sort of a union where-
under thev were beneficiaries. But the
greatest obstacle to successful cohesion
among seamen was, and is, inefficiency.
Theoretically a seaman —an A.B.—is a
trained tradesman capable of performing the
assortment of skilled work that occurs on
board a sailing-ship. Actually, even in sail-
ing-ship days, seafaring became largely an
outlet for the dead-beat of any, every and
no trade. British ships were particularly
lax. Usually every man in a forecastle had
signed on as A.B. In a large ship’s com-
pany probably less than half a dozen proved
competent seamen, and on these devolved
the real professional work of the ship.
The incompetents chipped iron-rust and
washed paint-work, enjoying a less exacting
time than the competent men whom they
equalled in pay and status. Yet, knowing
these men to be incompetent, shipmasters
issued certificates of discharge endorsed
“V.G.” (very good), the motive in’esumably
being to maintain an over-supply of labor.
Since the virtual elimination of British
sailing-ships crews have come to consist of
(1) what the sailing-ship man considers
unskilled men, and (2) men doing various
jobs for which little skill (and that easily
acquired) is needed—-firemen and coal-trim-
mers ; deckhands who rarely if ever take
a trick at the wheel; stewards and cooks
and stewards’ and cooks’ assistants, and
these in numerous ratings; men rated as
“general servant,” and other designations
which to the real sailor appear incongruous
and freakish. Seafaring having thus be-
come an unskilled trade —deck, engine-room
and other officers excepted—-for which in
Britain there exists an unlimited supply of
labor, under normal conditions a maritime
strike has become' more than ever hopeless.
Aware of this, the seamen postponed action
until their arrival abroad, where the supply
of labor is less plentiful and where the
native-born community lacks conception of
the desperate poverty prevalent among the
unskilled workers in British ports. But
even abroad the strike as a weapon against
organised capital and the resentment of
producers innocently affected is apt to be,
as we have seen, merely suicidal. —Yours,
Ernest Osborne.

Dolorous Days for Drys.
Queensland experience does not support
the theory of the Maoriland prohibitionists
that, if the State-control issue Avere excluded,
they would lift Bung’s scalp. In May last
their Queensland congeners got what they
had long been clamoring for, a straightout
vote on the wet or dry issue without any
humbug about State control, and their defeat
was decisive. Polls were taken in 43 local-
option areas widely scattered throughout the
State, and the complete figures were only
made available a week or two ago. In 25
areas the vote was taken on the proposition
“That the sale of intoxicating liquors in this
local-option area shall be prohibited.” In
18 areas the proposition Avas “That new
licenses may be granted in this local-option
area.” On the first question the drys were
defeated by straightout majorities in 22 areas
out of the 25. In the other three areas the
majority for prohibition fell short of the
required 60 p.c. IpsAvich got nearest with
56.6. The aggregate vote on the prohibition
issue Avas :
For . . .. .. 36,685
Against .. • • 47,229
Majority against .. 10,544
The net result Avas that prohibition was de-
feated in every area Avhere a vote was taken.
Meanwhile the wets were carrying votes for
new licenses Avith enthusiasm. In 16 areas
out of 18 new licenses were approved of by
effective majorities; in Mt. Isa the majority
was 94.6 p.c. of the votes recorded. Only one
area —Avith the smallest poll of the lot- —was
adverse to new licenses ; in auother, though
the supporters off new licenses predominated,
the vote fell sliotrt of the necessary 35 p.c.
Taking the wholes 18 areas the voting was :
For new licenses .. 10,997
Against .. .. 2,313
Majority for .. 8,684
The number of wW licenses to be granted in
any area is a majtter for the discretion of the
Licensing Court. Publess districts out back
and new centras of population in Central
and North Queensland Avill get most of them.

Small Sister’s Constitutional Dog-fight.
After having the Appropriation Bill and
Taxation Bill off last year passed AVithout its
blessing and consent, the Speck’s House of
Lords recently invited another slap in tue
face from the hiorny hand of a Labor Gov-
ernment by holding up the latest Appropria-
tion Bill at a time when only four days
supply was in hand. The right of the Up-
stairs Place to monkey Avith money bills,
which has been a bone of contention for
some time, could hardly have been asserted
in a more unfortunate fashion, since the
pay-day of public servants throughout the
State depended! upon the prompt passage of
the measure, so for a third time a Labor
Administration, has taken a money bill direct
from the Assembly to Governor O’Grady,
who has gracipusly affixed the royal rubber-
stamp. It would seem that the Lords were
encouraged in their contumacy on the latest
occasion by a belief that Premier Lyons
was uncertain of his constitutional ground.
The Assembly had offered to submit to the
Privy Council”® ruling as to (a) the powers
of the Council to amend money bills and (b)
the validity of last year’s Appropriation and
Taxation Acts, passed by the Assembly only,
and the offer was interpreted as indicating
a certain degree of funk in Labor circles.
Acting on this impression, the Council, in a
barney with the Assembly over the Appro-
priation Bill, emphatically reiterated that it
had a right to do what it darned well liked
with any bill sent up to it, money or other-
wise, and enumerated six objections to the
bill it had just rejected. The Assembly,
through Lyons, retorted that five of the six
grounds were contrary to fact and the Avhole
six puerile and inconsequential. The best
feature of the Avliole business is that the other
day the Privy Council signified its williug-
ness to settle the bet, and the Council is
trying to make up its mind whether it will
or will not join the Assembly in submitting
a memorial embodying the questions to be
settled. But it is obviously a case for the re-
ferendum. Two questions should be submitted
to the people: (1) Do you Avant a second
Chamber? (2) If you do want one, do
you want a property franchise or a Chamber
elected on the same roll as Federal Senators?
The Privy Council cannot say what the
wishes of the people of to-day are ; at the best
it can only interpret a measure which was
vaguely supposed to represent their wishes
many years ago. Only _ a referendum can
be a satisfactory solution of Tasmania s
problem—or as nearly satisfactory as cir-
cumstances will permit.

Cocky and the Agents.
The Farm Produce Agents Bill now before
the N. S. Wales Assembly is an attempt to
grapple with a serious problem. If it should
prove workable the grower or things is likely to
get a better deal than he has sometinies had and
prompter returns. The provision against dump-
ing saleable goods is also a fair tiling, though
the statement that it shall be a sufficient de-
fence that the destruction did not raise or
tend to raise the price of similar produce to
the public looks like an intentional hole
through which a waggon of cabbages may be
comfortably driven. For what purpose should
an agent or anybody else dump a consignment
of saleable goods if by doing so the price is
not raised? If potatoes are selling at xlo
per toil in a well-stocked market and some-
body destroys a thousand tons on the way to
the sale, the price of £ls may remain un-
altered, and as there has been no rise there
can be no prosecution. The obvious fact
that a fall in price was prevented, and the
public thereby denied a cheap article, is not
to count in the matter of sufficient defence.
Yet probably more stuff has been dumped
far from the market to prevent a fall than
has ever gone to any destructor to deliber-
ately engineer a rise. But the most remark-
able feature of the bill is a provision that a
buyer at wholesale must not re-sell at whole-
sale to make a profit in the same market or
within five miles of it.. As a means of
stopping speculative buying this is clumsy
and of very doubtful value. Smith, who lias
made a large purchase, cannot accommodate
Jones with a portion of it at a small profit
which will pay for the turnover; yet Robin-
son, who has deliberately speculated for a
rise, can sell as he likes by the simple expe-
dient of conducting the sale at a small branch
office five miles away, which he keeps for the
purpose. On the other hand, if Smith, after
purchase, suddenly found that for any rea-
son he could not handle the goods, he dare
not re-offer them for sale under the hammer
in case somebody might bid above liis origi-
nal price. The provision looks as if it might
very greatly hamper the regular trader and
prove only a very small hurdle for the specu-
lative profiteer to jump.
Bolshevism and Christianity.
Alice Jackson holds her ground:—
In an article which bristles with quotations,
Maurice Blackburn (B. 26/11/’25) counsels me to
change my quotation service. In reply I might
advise him to change his synopsis service, for his
summary of Marx’s arguments concerning the com-
munity of women misrepresents the main point. A
fair summary reads as follows: “The community of
women is a natural thing. The bourgeois practises
it sub rosa. It is not a reproach, but a credit to the
Communist that he wishes to make this community
open and official. AVe would abolish that hypocritical
capitalistic community of women which masquerades
as marriage, and establish an open, natural, Com-
munistic community: ergo, prostitution will dis-
appear.” The argument, which is partly quoted by
Mr. Blackburn, continues ; “For the rest, nothing is
more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our
bourgeois at the community of women, which they
pretend is to be openly and officially established by
the Communists. The Communists have no need to
introduce the community of women; it has existed
almost from time immemorial. Our bourgeois, not
content with having the wives and daughters of the
proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common
prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing
each other’s wives. Bourgeois marraige is, in reality,
a system of wives in common, and thus, at the most,
what the Communists might possibly be reproached
with is that they desire to introduce, in substitution
for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised
community of women .” If marriage is private pros-
titution, and it is abolished in favor of any system
of the community of women, it is self-evident that
public prostitution will not disappear. It will merely
become compulsory and universal.
Mr. Blackburn wants me to read Trotsky’s
latest book. I can’t promise to do so, because since
I read “The Defence of Terrorism,” I’ve lost my
taste for Trotsky. The theories of these gentle
Communists, who are so concerned to secure “free-
dom” for woman that they would destroy home life
for her sake, do no longer intrigue me.
Mr. Blackburn strains his quotation service to
prove that there is a parallel between the ideals of
the Early Christians and those of the Bolsheviks.
But not one of his quotations refers to either a
Christian or a Bolshevik ideal. They merely seek
to demonstrate that the Early Christians despised
wealth, and were indifferent to the virtues of a
governing class. If Mr. Blackburn thinks I would
wish to dispute this, he misunderstands me. The
average Christian of seventeen or eighteen centuries
ago was undoubtedly as ignorant as the average
Bolshevik of to-day on all questions of economics and
sociology. But this concession does not establish
any ethical resemblance between the Christian and
the Bolshevik. The Christian was indifferent to
property and politics because he fervently believed
that Christ’s Kingdom was at hand. He sought
perfection, not property. I do not claim, either, that
in their communism these Christians were the only
people who have been inspired by a lofty ideal of
self-sacrifice for the common weal. History tells
us of other great Utopians, and among these may be
included some of the early socialists. But the
advent of the bourgeois Prussian Jew Mordecai (or
Marx) portended the end of idealism in practical
socialism. The so-called Communist of to-day cares
for the interests of cne class of the community only.
Christ preached of love and brotherhood. Marx
and the Bolsheviks rave of hate and bloodshed.
Christ is the supreme teacher in the spiritual realm.
The Bolshevik is a despicable robber in the material
world.
Mr. Blackburn concludes with a thrust at that
hypocritical official Christianity which Arnold re-
garded as Satan’s masterpiece. He thinks Bunyan
would have agreed with Arnold. But would Arnold
or Bunyan have held, or does Mr. Blackburn hold,
that Christ would have approved of these “Satanic”
tactics? If not, the intrusion of this phase of history
into our present discussion is as irrelevant as are Mr.
Blackburn’s speculations on my probable behavior
had I lived 17 centuries ago.
Mr. Blackburn will more easily convert me to his
views if he will quote for me some Bolshevik aspira-
tion which breathes a spirit parallel to that of the
Sermon on the Mount, some Golden Buie of Com-
munism which does not drip blood and mouth hatred.
If there is indeed a parallel between the ideals of
A Nasty Cup Dream.
It was November of a year
My luck was rather out, I tear—
Tue Prophet and, of course, the Bard
Must be prepared to “take it hard :
In any age, in pay land, _
Their work is mostly done m sand.
But often, when their days are spent,
This sand will harden to cement,
And then its warnings or its fears
Become a message to the years
Which any citizen may see
Who reads his blanky history.
On this November, once a time,
In search of pleasure or of rhyme—
In search of any old damned tiling
A man like me may seek or sing
i strolled a-dreaming slowly down
The paves of Bourke-street, Melbourne
Town,
And saw its sporting groups await
The dictum of their gambling fate;
The news they pined for soon would be
Flashed o’er the land from sea to sea
A yearly race, a Grand Event,
That thrills an empty continent.
The distant punters in the Bush,
The members of the Bourke-street push,
In swollen cities, scattered towns,
Across the ranges, o’er the downs,
From Somerset to Tallin gup
They waited for the Melbourne Cup I
Distrait I dourly went my way
With mind averse that holiday.
I oft-times drink, I sometimes bet,
I am nor saint nor wowser; yet
Sour thoughts, inopportune, intrude
At times my free Australian mood.
I lay that night uneasily;
And, lo! a vision came to me.
I saw a black cloud in the north;
It, rifted and delivered forth
An arrnfed host, with steel and name,
Intent to play another game.
Their ironclads in fighting trim
Ranged slowly down with purpose grim,
And ere the Gup-time cheering died
In volleys crashed a full broadside
That burst with dire effect upon
The crowded lawns of Flemington .
To hateful vision still in tlirall.
I saw the splintered grandstand fall.
While frantic trainers, trembling touts,
Ran to and fro with frenzied shouts,
And women in their Cup array,
All blood-bespattered dying lay
The judge’s box I watched it fly,
Shell-lifted, to a shrieking sky;
The winning jockey and his horse

some have shown signs of doing), they will
go down ingjoriously. But there is a big
chance to build up an Australian type of
film that would depend on quiet drama and
a realistic atmosphere. If the intention was
clear, it would not be hard to gather the
right kind of actors, and establish a tradi-
tion of honesty that would provide a sharp
contrast with th,e tricks and sentimentality
of Hollywood. It is only by producing some-
thing distinctive and real that we will be

“ Jackeroo” : “Good Australian” (B.
19/11/’25) tells no more than truth when he
writes from Switzerland that “Our own
climate is as good as any in the world for
tubercle.” The trouble is that there is so
much of it and it is so ridiculously cheap
that few patients take advantage of it. They
persist in going to a doctor instead of going
out back, and it is the city that kills unfor-
tunates with weak chests or lungs. I
know dozens of men carrying on in West-
ern Queensland to-day who were tubercle
wrecks. They had sense enough to go while
the going was good. Take my own case.
I enlisted in Sydney and caught a chill or
something in Egypt. I landed in England
a physical wreck. A fortnight later another
the Early Christian and those of the Bolsheviks,
surely, in the extensive literature of Bolshevism
there must exist some gentle and kindly counsel,
some aphorism of spiritual significance to man. If
it exists, and I have overlooked it, surely Mr.
Blackburn will enlighten my ignorance and quote
it tp me!

Queensland Politics, Federal and State.
Dear Bulletin,* —It is natural enough to
predict that the Federal victory of the Coali-
tion in Queensland will be followed by
a triumph at the State election, but exces-
sive optimism is not good business. Only
strenuous organisation and stern battling for
the next few months can pull it off. The
circumstances differ in the Commonwealth
and State spheres. In the case of the State
you have, first of all, to deal with an arrange-
ment of electorates which, unlike the scrupu-
lously fair Federal system, is all in favor of
the Labor party. The. McCormack crowd
gets its majority mainly from the North, and
the way Government servants are bunched at
strategic points about Cairns, Eacham and
Chillagoe is a thing to marvel at. And
here it must be remembered that, for every
Government employee who looks anxiously at
his job when Federal elections come round,
the State has four or five, many of whom
belong to organisations affiliated with the
A.L.P. This factor alone is of mighty im-
port. Again, the unpurged State rolls have
a good many thousands more names than
the Federal lists contain, and this is no small
matter. Further, the open and flagrant brib-
ing of constituencies with loan money—an
element almost inoperative at Federal elec-
tions—becomes fearfully active at State elec-
tions. Hence while Federal Labor was badly
beaten in Queensland at the 1917, 1919, 1922
and 1925 elections, the State Labor party
won in 1918, 1920 and 1923. Nevertheless,
with an undivided Opposition and moderately
capable leadership, the victory can be gained.
The old Continuous Tory party was even
more firmly entrenched in its day than is
political Labor at present, but it was dis-
lodged as soon as the Opposition groups had
room and time for sanity. A lot will depend
on the quality of the candidates whom the
present Queensland Opposition puts in the
field. In the past it has relied far too much
on jaded old party hacks, but the example
of Dr. Nott, following on the successes of
Cameron in Brisbane and Josiaii Francis
in Moreton, should surely have convinced it
that it needs the services of young men, pre-
ferably Diggers.—Yours, etc., Oil) Hand.
The “Pictures” for Australia.
Robert Nichols, the English poet, has been
making an investigation of Hollywood in
an effort to discover why the world doesn’t
get better moving pictures, but he .is unable
to decide whether the low standard is due
to the ignorance of the movie bosses or
the crude taste of the “hicks” for whom they
chiefly cater. The hicks are the farmers and
small townsmen of the Middle West of the
U.S.A.; but though their territory is spotted
V'ith picture-palaces, and films are almost
their sole diversion, it isn’t likely that they
are responsible for all the inanities of Holly-
wood. They may be the hopeless yokels
11. L. Mencken alleges them to be, but there
is no evidence that their patronage of night-
club scenes and sticky sentimentalities is
anything but mechanical; they swallow what
they are given—like the rest of us. The
real trouble is that the business of providing-
pictures for the world has become centralised
in the hands of a type that is known and
despised everywhere—the low-browed, cigar-
chewing entrepreneur. He is a creature that
somehow flourishes among all the mushroom
stucco palaces that have sprung up in recent
years to provide for public entertainment—
stadiums, dance-halls and wonderland cities.
Shrewd, gross, expansive, he has a rough gift
for organisation, and a talent for finding
the lowest common denominator of the people
around him. But it is less due to his enter-
prise than to automatic growth that the
picture-industry has swelled to gigantic pro-
portions. Circumstances of climate and
priority have been kind to him, and laid the
world obligingly at his feet for him to kick.
With perfect complacency he makes himself
the arbiter of a cosmopolitan world, assert-
ing that “the fans won’t stand for clever
stuff.” And so money is poured out on
expensive idiocies, and the masterpieces of
the world are disembowelled in order to send
the hero and heroine driving away all dolled
up in a big car. Before Australia begins to
take a serious hand in the business of making
films, it would be as well for our producers
to think a little about their objective. It
is a mistake to say that Hollywood has pros-
pered merely because of its inanity. There
is plenty of evidence, especially outside the
U.S.A., that audiences are not satisfied with
their moron fare. Resides, there is uo chance
of competing with Hollywood in mere in-
anity. That fantastic village has the money,
the organisation and the publicity. If our
producers try to import Hollywood features
and give them an Australian setting (as
NO USE FOR SCIENCE.
“The N.S.W. Labor Government, having increased its own salaries and those of members of the
Leg. Assembly by £28,560 p.a., is abolishing the Observatory from motives of ‘economy.’ Lavoisier,
the great French chemist, was guillotined by the butchers of the Revolution. The reply to a petition
in his favor was: ‘The Republic can do without scientists.’”
SHADE OF REVOLUTIONARY : “Congratulations, citizen!”
Digger and myself were bundled into Tid-
worth Hospital as t.-b. patients. The big-
ward was crowded with undoubted t.b.’s, but
our reports were negative. They said I had
bronchial catarrh. I was in England (one
of the worst places in the world for chesty
folk) for about six months—chiefly in hospi-
tals. Then they reckoned they could win
the war without me, so packed me off home.
On return I foolishly went back to my old
job, but was as bad as ever in three months.
A wise.doctor said “Go west, young man!'’
and I went. I pulled up at a station in
Western Queensland, and the dry, health-
giving atmosphere l out there did the trick.
The head stockman on that run was told in
Brisbane that he was gone beyond repair,
but the change had worked miracles, and
he looked good for a century when I last
saw him. Spajilinger’s treatment may do
all that Is hoped for it some day; meanwhile
my advice to anybody who is a bit chesty is
to pack the carpet-bag and hit out for the
mulga and stay there.
The W.A. police force, which complains that
it is expected to use only batons and moral
suasion for the subjugation of rioters armed
with dog-spikes lashed on sticks, is the
latest class to make things unpleasant for
the wobbly Collier Government. The whir-
ligig of the last six years has wrought some
queer changes in W.A. politics and on the
Fremantle wharves. In 1919, when recalci-
trant lumpers were refusing to allow loyal-
ists to work there, Colebatch, then Premier,
had the Riot Act read on a certain Sunday
morning. But the ugly crowd that had col-
lected took little notice, and, though one
of the strikers was killed in the collision that
followed, Law and Order got distinctly the
worst of it, and was finally forced to retire
in ignominious fashion. Colebatch ex-
plained afterwards that, although the Riot
Act had been read, he would never have per-
mitted the police to fire on their assailants,
and he actually consented to work being sus-
pended for a few minutes in the railways
while Labor paid its last tributes at the
funeral of a man who had been killed while
qualifying for a term of penal servitude.
But the then Premier's climb-down availed
him nothing; amid a storm of denunciation
led by present-Premier Collier, who roundly
declared that he would devote his best efforts
to hounding Colebatch out of Parliament,
the latter resigned the Premiership to Mit-
chell, and stepped back into a subordinate
position in the Ministry. Now Collie): is
being attacked by the police for subjecting
them to hampering restrictions when they
have to quell riots, and giving them only half-
hearted support when they have to meet
lawless violence with lawful force. The
police, in fact, are verbally-trouncing Collier
for not doing what Collier said he would
have Colebatch (now Agent-General for the
Gabor Government) drummed out of public
life for hesitatingly trying to do. It’s a
quaint situation, deplorable in that it must
weaken confidence in the enforcement of the
law in time of public disturbances.

“Aorangi” : Certain Australian admirers of
Dr. Truby King, the M.L. authority on
baby-culture, write as if he were the founder
of a complete school of infant diet and
hygiene, and as if his recipes and treatments
were fiual and infallible. Dr. King’s con-
tribution to medical science is an important
one, but not so big as all that. In the
first place, it has to be borne in mind that
King cultivated practically a virgin field.
When he started his investigations—he ex-
perimented with calves and bullocks, by the
way—every practitioner knew a good deal
about how to help babies into the world, but
almost nothing about what to do with them
when they had arrived. That had to be left
to Nature, and, if not to Nature, then to
the milkman; if those two props broke down
the little life had to end. King’s first and
greatest and most important achievement was
the recipe for synthetic mother’s milk —
“humanised milk,” as he calls it. It takes
care and a certain amount of intelligence to
make “humanised milk,” and there are
mothers who find it too much trouble, or
who are unable to understand the directions.
There is a little excuse for them, since Truby
King’s handbook, “The Feeding and Care of
the Child,” is one of the most chaotic and
bewildering compilations ever published. It
simply shrieks for drastic rearrangement and
ruthless sub-editing. To aid mothers to make
"humanised milk” and apply the sounder of
the thousand and one rules of hygiene and
diet laid down in King’s handbook, there is,
in MX., an organisation known as the Plun-
ket Nurses, which lays itself out to give
advice and demonstrations, and undoubtedly
does a lot of good. There are also baby-
hospitals, known as Karitane hospitals after
the pioneer institution of the kind, where
backward infants may be sent for treatment.
My first child’s life was saved, without any
doubt, by “humanised milk.” My second
child nearly lost his life in a Karitane hos-
pital, from which I removed him in the nick
of time, placing him in the charge of a
former hospital matron, who pulled him round
by methods of her own that are not written
in any book. That is my warrant for say-
ing that Dr. King, valuable as his work has
been, has not said the last word about the
saving of babies.

There is a Melbourne butcher who wishes
he hadn’t trampled with the iron heel of
ruthless tyranny upon the faces of the poor.
It had been agreed by the employers that
on the occasion of a stop-work meeting one .
hand from each shop should attend, but his
two men both insisted on going, and when
they returned he gave them the sack. The
union vigilance officer warned him, but he
took no heed, and he was solemnly informed
that his shop was on the “black list.” Other
men whom he took on were told to leave him
if they desired to avoid being “kicked to
pieces”; he was denied supplies of meat
from the abattoirs, where he was told that
the union had stopped his supplies; even
the dustman refused to call at his premises,
so that said premises became a menace to
public health. He poured his tale of woe
into the Arbitration Court later, with the
result that, after a few hours, the union
rep. told the Court that he “had arranged
for the resumption of supplies” to this
wicked butcher. What Deputy-President
John Quick said is not recorded, but so
emphatic have these Arbitration Courts be-
come that it was probably “Tut,” or even
“Tut-tut.”

“Loco”: On paper, the achievements of the
CB6 N.S.W. locomotives may read well (B.
5/11/’25). It sounds very economical to
have an engine that will do the 400 miles
from Sydney to Albury without changing
crews; but such a run would be plain bru-
tality. I refuse to believe that the Chief
Mechanical Engineer ever intended it. He
knows the human limit as well as the mech-
anical limit; even a first-class passenger
will generally cry enough at the end of a
400-mile journey. As for the engine-driver
at 50 miles an hour, including stops, it would
be an eight-hour trip—eight hours of nerve
strain, with every sense to be kept on the
alert for every one of the 480 minutes.

“P.alala” : Every railway-carriage in N. S.
Wales bears a placard exhorting one to buy
“Australian Mades.” Yet to-day when I
purchased a dozen boxes of matches at the
Commissioners’ stall at Sydney station I
found they were “Made in Sweden.” Mean-
while, matches equal in quality to anything
in the world are being made in Australia.

POLITICAL
POINTS
In an effort to get a bit more revenue from
the alleged film industry, S. Aus. Premier
John Gunn has introduced the following
amendment to his State’s Income Tax Act:
Every party who hires any cinematograph film for
exhibition within the State shall, in addition to any
other income-tax payable by that party, pay income-
tax at the rate of Is. in the £ on 00 p.c. of the
gross amount paid for the hire of such film. The
said party may deduct from the amount payable by
way of hire such a sum as is necessary to pay the
tax imposed by this section. Where the party paying
any sum as hire under this section pays tax on
the sum so paid and the person receiving such sum
furnishes a return in which such sum is included,
that sum shall not be taken into account in comput-
ing the taxable amount of income of the person
receiving the same.
According to Gunn, Australian taxation is
persistently dodged by Americans who re-
ceive prodigious profits from the Common-
wealth, and he warns those harpies that
the showing of American films may be pro-
hibited in his State. It is obviously a
case for common action by the State
Governments. If John Gunn can bring it
about, much will be forgiven him and them.
The Sydney Labor Daily announced the
other morning that it had discovered a
Nationalist plot to nobble “several” Labor
Assemblymen, "the sum of £20,000 being
freely mentioned.” Thereupon a Minister
(unnamed) said he did not believe any of
his comrades would “do the Judas act for
a fixed sum of money,” and OTlalloran.
Matthew Charlton protests that there is
something wrong with a system which admits
of a party polling just on half a million votes,
as Political Labor did in N. S. Wales,
without winning a Senate seat. Still, Charl-
ton didn’t curse it when his party won the
whole 18 seats contested in 1914, although
the margin then between the third Labor
Senator and the fourth man was only 1141
in Victoria, 2444 in Queensland, 3942 in
Westralia and 36,040 altogether, whereas
Cox, the first N.S.W. Nationalist Senator to
be elected the other day, beat Labor’s first
choice by 78,085. Nor was Charlton heard
to complain when his party gained all the
Vic., Queensland and Westraliau Senate
seats at the double dissolution in 1914, and
went close to capturing the whole 36, although
the voting was almost equal in N.S.W. and
Tasmania and very close in Westralia. Any-
how, the system can’t be altered by adopting
proportional voting without making it im-
possible for Labor to elect half the Senators
in 1928, which will be possible, though not
probable, if things remain as they are.
Being placed fourth on the Ministerial
ticket when there w T ere only three vacancies
proved too great a handicap for Wilson, the
S. Aus. Senator and Minister for Markets
and Migration. By the irony of things, the
bulk of his preferences and (in the end) his
seat went to the former Assemblyman Chap-
man, who was nominated by the Cocky orga-
nisation after its quarrel with Wilson; the
other successful Ministerialists are Newland,
sometime Labor conscriptionist. _ and
McLachlan, of the Liberal Union. Wilson’s
downfall will necessitate taking another
South Australian into the Ministry unless
he can persuade the S. Aus. Parliament to
give him the seat left vacant by the death
of Labor Senator J. V. O’Loghlin, and that
doesn’t seem likely. Dicky Foster was
Bruce’s colleague in the last Hughes Govern-
ment, but the Priminister may favor Dun-
can-Huglies, who is 27 years younger than
Foster (70).
The cause of Peace is reported to have
been advanced by two agreements signed in
London last week. In one case J. Bull
bound himself to maintain the territorial
settlements specified in the Treaty of Ver-
sailles as regards the French, German and
Belgian frontiers, and to pitch into any party
violating them or commencing an unprovoked
war, provided the League of Nations does not
effectually intervene. The arrangement im-
poses no obligation on the Commonwealth
unless it is formally accepted by the Aus-
tralian Government. In the other case the
powers of the Irish Boundary Commission,
which was about to submit a report adverse
to the Free State, were revoked, and the
present line is to remain unless altered by
mutual arrangement. There are to be con-
cessions, of course. The Free State is re-
leased from its obligation under the Anglo-
Irish Treaty to contribute portion of the
TJ.K. public debt and Avar pensions; and the
German Nationalists suggest that J.
Bull should drop the idea of restoring
shattered industries by means of protective
duties. Whereupon a British critic re-
marks bitterly, with some justification, that
J. Bull pays everybody but nobody pays him.
THE MORNING AFTER .
SEAMAN (surveying his damaged surroundings): “Well, I suppose I must have enjoyed
mcself!”
declared that the party was “proud
of its personnel” :
Some dastardly things have been done by National-
ists in the Federal area and in Queensland, but since
the days of Conscription we have had no accidents
in this State. Let them look elsewhere for the base
metal.
This is very consoling, but not quite correct.
It is only a few months since a Royal Com-
missioner reported on an “accident’ m
which a Sydney Labor alderman, who is now
an M.L.A., was concerned. The price men-
tioned on that occasion, according to the
Commissioner, was “four fifties” —one for
the uplifter >of the struggling masses and
three for pals.
Lang’s widows’ pensions scheme,. which is
not really a plan for pensioning widows but
one for subsidising their children, is based
on a 14-year-old M.L. enactment. The only
difference is that Lang proposes to pay a
widow and one child under 14 30s. a week,
while the bereaved lady in the Dominion in
similar circs, gets only 225. 6d., though more
is promised by the recently victorious Coates.
In each case as soon as the youngest, off-
spring turns 14 the eligibility of the widow
for the pension ceases. At last count the
Shaky Islands were subsidising about 3500
widows and 8000 youngsters at a cost of
something over £200,000 a year. VV ith
approximately twice the population, and a
scheme 25 per cent, more expensive the
addition to the N.S.W. Budget should be
about half a million a year for a start.
The recent M.L. licensing poll shows de-
creasing affection for the idea of the beerless
life and a steady growth of sentiment in
favor of State control. In April, 1919, when
a special poll was taken on two issues (con-
tinuance and prohibition with compensation),
continuance won by .10,362 votes. Allegedly
many prohibitionists, bitterly opposing com-
pensation and confident of victory in the
three-issue poll promised later in the same
year, voted with the Demon Rum. They
came within 3263 votes of their aim in
December, 1919; in 1922 they were in a
minority of 17,605; this year the balance,
against them is 36,177. The State Control
vote was 32,361 in 1919, 35,727 in 1922 and
56,043 this year.
Among Theodore’s presents to Queensland
were the Brisbane tramways, compulsorily
purchased for £1,400,000 plus costs. It was
known that the .Government would have to
spend money like water on additions and ex-
tensions, the co. having done nothing in those
directions, during the years in which it was
threatened with expropriation: and it was
also k/iown what motor-'bus competition had
done to tramway profits in London, Sydney,
Adelaide and Perth. But nationalisation with
loan money is the Labor policy and Theodore
went gaily ahead. Last week the concern was
placed under the control of the Greater Bris-
bane Council. In handing it over the chair-
man of the Trust which has been running it
for a year or so genially explained that it
was showing a loss, and that the Council
would have to choose between raising fares
and dipping into the rates.
The Victorian Government plans to estab-
lish a rural bank on the same lines as that
in N. S. Wales, and the necessary legisla-
tion has been introduced. Industries imme-
diately associated with rural pursuits are to
be assisted, as well as “primary producers,”
and advances will be made by long-term
mortgages and by overdraft. To obtain funds
the Savings Bank Commissioners are
authorised by the bill to issue stock or de-
bentures up to £6,000,000, and they are to
rtceive additional fees for their extra work;
but the staff of the Savings Bank, which has
176 branches, will only be slightly increased.
The measure is one of a score which the
Ministry is trying to get through before
Christmas.
Labor stonewalled the Seats Commission
Bill in Vic. Assembly for 24 hours, and then
the second reading was carried by 26 votes
to 22. The unfriendly attitude of A. A.
Billson (Lib.) and Carlisle (Farmers’
Union) at the beginning of the debate led
Labor to believe that there might be some
defections from the Ministerial ranks, but
there were none. Counting pairs, Prender-
gast’s party polled its full strength (28)
and was supported by McLachlan (Ind.).
There were two absentees from the Minis-
terial side. As the House had been sitting
for nearly 28J hours, Ministers were con-
tent with the second reading last week, and
are having another go at the bill this week.
Queensland Laborites are playing a game
of “We love them; we love them not” with
the communists. First of all the executive
of Brisbane Trades and Labor Council said
it would eject its communist tenants; but
the communists said it, couldn’t, and the
Council said it shouldn’t. Then another
Council meeting was held, and a motion
for ejection was carried by 39 to 28. The
Central Executive of the A.L.P. also took
a hand in the game by expelling the railway
union delegates, Rymer and Moroney, for
refusing to sign the anti-communist pledge.
This does not mean expulsion from tne
Labor Party, but merely that the C.E. will
not accept these men as delegates. Rymer
and Moroney are not communists; as they
are not members of any communist organ-
isation they could easily have signed the
pledge, but they refused to do so because
they regarded it as mere humbug. Railway-
men regard the expulsion of their officials
as revenge for the humiliation of the Govern-
ment in the recent railway strike. Mean-
while the communists are chuckling at all
the free publicity they are getting.
Political adversity doesn't favor optimism,
and Oppositions are usually camps of Cas-
sandras. Hence it is not unexpected to find
lou Ward, Maoriland’s veteran Liberal
leader, prophesying disaster. Gazing into
the crystal Joseph sees loan money not only
dear, but—horror of horrors!—unobtain-
able. On top of which he remarks pleasantly
that there is going to be an all-round drop
in prices soon. While Uncle Samuel is so
diligently searching for foreign investments
that wiil relieve the pressure on the Avails
of the Federal Reserve Bank’s vaults, it is
hardly likely that accommodation will be
denied altogether; but if British trade de-
pression continues there certainly may be
a slump in prices in M.L.'s only market.
It is alleged that Queensland railway-
men Avho had their pay docked during the
strike are getting it back by manufacturing
overtime. The Avay they do it, according to
Kater, a N. S. Wales M.L.C., is by post-
poning the departure of trains. A friend
of his who went to a North Q. station to
catch a train scheduled to leave at noon Avas
told it would not till 2. and on attend-
ing at 2 he found the time had been altered
to 4. The stationmaster said that the men
who had to take the train out Avere respon-
sible for the alteration. “They are in con-
trol,” he added : “the heads have no say in
the matter.” Which proves, if true, that
there are more ways of killing a cat than
by choking it with butter.
The Tremulous Isles are Avaking up to the
importance of aircraft. The Mayor of Wel-
lington is inviting shillings to buy tin aero-
plane so that a couple of young Maorilanders
may try to hop across the Tasman. The
M.L. Air Service is helping—oh yes! It has
gii’en advice as to what sort of plane ought
to be imported. The joke is that only a
few years ago the British Government offered
to give M.L. all the biplanes, monoplanes,
seaplanes, bombing-planes and any-other-sort-
of-planes it cared to accept, free, buckshee
and for nothing, and the offer w T as merely
pigeonholed.
One of those points which Yankee criminal
lawyers argue for weeks, in cases like those
of the millionaire cliild-slayers Loeb and
Leopold, was tried in a matter-of-fact appeal
court in London, and failed. Alfred Kopsch,
19, did a nasty slaughter of his pretty
married aunt, Beryl Thornton, aged -1.
Blighted affection Avithin the prohibited
degrees was a possible cause. The plea
advanced against the conviction Avas that
the deed wasn’t done by the youth who did
it, but by his sub-conscious mind. Not
being of the U.S. brand. British luav took
up the simple attitude that if it was that
sort of mind it was better dead.
“X.R.N.” : A good many retired naval offi-
cers are a bit nettled at the action of the
Admiraltv in handing them over to the Aus-

their connection, such as it is, with White-
hall. They have been informed that they
“may be employed in time of Avar or emer-
gency by the Commonwealth Government
and regarded as lent to the R.A.N.” The
arrangement may lead to all sorts of diffi-
culties. What would happen if England
Avent to war and Australia kept out? Would
England’s enemy regard it as an act of Avar
if Australia permitted ns to leave for Eng-
land ?
An important ruling Avas given in the Vic.
Assembly last week. During an all-night
sitting Speaker Bowser, appealed to by the
Labor Opposition, declined to rule that snor-
ing was unparliamentary. The cause of the
appeal was Treasurer Alec Peacock, who
had been providing a nasal obligato to a
Laborite who was denouncing the Electoral
Bill.

THE GENTLE COMMUNIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The' communist is not always a wrecker.”
He hasn’t always a blood-stained axe
To break in the wash-house door;
The skulls are few that he really cracks
And leaves in a pool of gore.
He seldom marches along the street
In a cap of crimson hue
To knock plain citizens off their feet
If they do not share his view.
He doesn’t prevent the sowing of corn
Nor the slaughter of ripened sheep
To such an extent that the babe unborn
May curse his deeds in his sleep;
He does not order the banks to throw
Their gold in the public way,
Nor stand pale children up in a row
To shoot them every day.
These things he may do as a special stunt
To advertise his creed;
But it’s mostly his tongue that bears the brunt
Of his unaccomplished deed.
No, he’s not so bad, jou may readily see
At a single careful glance—
Not nearly as bad as he ought to be,
And would if you gave him the chance.

A year ago the banks were sweating over the
exchange difficulty. The pooling scheme came
to their relief; finally the reversion to the
gold standard cut the tangle in one stroke,
and what to the 8.N.5.W., with its enormous
exchange business, was an embarrassment at
September, 1924, had a year later turned
into something more like an embarrassment
of riches. The large increase in the volume
of exports, the higher prices realised and the
improved rate of interest earned on money
in London were contributors in winning the
greatest profit in the history of Australia's
greatest bank. It is probable no doubt that
the management disclosed nearer to what it
considered the actual net income than it did
in September, 1924. On that occasion mat-
ters looked very difficult, and it is not un-
reasonable to assume that the P. and L. total
was written with great restraint. These
figures make it plainer:—
Net Profit.
Six months ended March 31,1924 .. £458,620
Six months ended Sept. 30, 1924 .. 388,213
Twelve months ended Sept. 30, 1925.. 979,383
—an increase in disclosed profits of £182,550,
over 1924.
There are features about the latest
accounts apart from the record profit. ' For
the first, time in the co.’s 108 years the re-
port covers a year instead of a half-year;
and for the second time since 1894 the dividend
rises beyond 10 p.c., though the extra 2-4 p.c.
is called a bonus. Within the last decade pro-
fits have more than doubled, but more money
is, of course, at work nowadays. However,
£229,383 was added to visible reserves, and
a 5 p.c. bonus on salaries was handed to the
staff. The Board hastens to declare that
both bonuses “are exceptional, and are not
to be regarded as in any way a precedent.”
Maybe the directors hesitate to move beyond
the 10 p.c.; if so, shareholders will do much
less well than they did pre-war, when £lO,
whether received by way of dividend or other-
wise, bought as much as £lO or more will
to-day. It may be all right for recent buyers;
but for old holders —many of them bene-
ficiaries—the meal is sometimes rather
small.
The general prosperity of the people, no
matter how produced, coupled with the lift-
ing of values, shows up in a huge expansion
in deposits:—

increased under the influence of the remark-

the year, the gain amounting to £4,073,525.

The improvement in liquid assets- —
£6,122,593 —is accentuated by the low level
to which they had fallen at September, 1924.
Nevertheless, the total is greater than the
normal in the past. It will be remembered
that, immediately the dollar-sterling exchange
reached a level which made it practicable to
import gold from America, the bank arranged
for the shipment of £1,000,000, of which a
quarter-million was landed on February 10
—“the first bullion ever imported into Aus-
tralia from America.” Later on further
large shipments were obtained from S.
Africa. In all, the B.N.S.W.’s share of the
total imports of 101 millions was £2,250,000,
so much of the surplus funds which had accu-
mulated in London being thus transferred.
At September 80 funds in London had in-
creased by £4,750,000, but that accumulation
no longer occasions anxiety; it can be
moved quite freely now. That advances dim-
inished was due to the prosperity which re-
sulted in heavy repayments, new business not
absorbing an equivalent amount.
The substantial increase in liquid assets
was spread thus :

Bank balances . . . . 985,292 1,036,008
£27,850,352 £33,972,945
At Sept. 30 almost 51 p.c. of the bank’s total
outside liabilities was held liquid. The
amount was, in fact, greater, for “bills pay-
able and other liabilities” include reserves
for doubtful debts and investments fluctua-
tion ; and of the £9,093,185 a large amount
. certainly belongs to the bank. The man-
agement had 10s. of every £1 of liabilities in
quickly-realisable form ; and to represent the
remainder there were £42,676,111 of advan-
ces and £8804)00 in premises, both written
down.
The present year, judged on conditions to
date, should prove very satisfactory to pri-
mary producers, for the wheat yield will be
from fair to good, the wool clip heavy, butter
and sugar good and manufacturing activities
equal to last year’s figures at the very least.
Wool prices will not reach the sky-levels
and wheat may be a little lower. But except
for copper there is a highly payable market
for practically all our staples. The financing
of exports will not be the problem of 1924,
and some of the money which at the close
of last accounts was held liquid will have
been put into a profitable job. The 10 p.c.
div. calls for £600,000 and total visible funds
have to earn less than 6 p.c. to bring in that
amount. As at September 30, £6 6s. 7d. of
outside money was held for every £1 of share-
holders’ funds in view—and the bank could
carry another 10 millions of deposits and still
be well within the safety zone.

That last line makes quite a cheerful array.
But there are drab patches to be painted out
before the Board can pat itself on the back.
The table needs to be considered in con-
junction with this: —

In its four and a half years of policy-writing
the co. has won £5,274,158 of business. But
given a sufficient frenzy and a drove of “go-
getters,” any concern can win business.
What one needs to know is (a) what class
of business is passing through the office;
(b) how much of it sticks; and (c) how
much it costs to win. Regarding (a)
the report says that the bulk of the
business consists of whole-life and endowment
for 20 years and upwards; but detailed
figures are not given. Last year 42.6 p.c.
of the business was whole-life. That is defi-
nite —and satisfactory. Incidentally, the
average amount assured was £3l4—likewise
satisfactory. Renewals certainly improved ;
but add 1924 renewals (£41,788) to the pre-
miums yielded by the business written that
year (£55,908) and you get a total of
£97,696, whereas renewal premiums last year
were only £67,014. A big volume of lapsed
policies is taken for granted by young cos.;
but that proportion will have to be cut down.
The worst of it is that the lapsed business
probably cost more to get than it brought
the co. Last year, for instance, new business
exes, (allowing that it cost 10 times as much
as old) ran into 197 p.c. In other words,
for every £lOO the office got from policies
taken out last year, £197 was spent. Thus
1925 business lias to hold at least two years
it the co. isn’t to be out of pocket over it,
even assuming there are no claims within
that period. Business costing so much has
to be well held to pay.
The Southern Cross is faced with the
necessity of cutting costs. It must do that if it
is to have any early chance of success. With
reduced costs it can build up its funds. It
is making some progress. Last year, for
instance, income was £20,157 in excess of
claims and expenditure. Not that that
amount was clear, for there is to be set
against that the actuarial liability on policies
in force. Policy-holders, however, are well
protected. In cash £281,353 of share capital
has been subscribed, and over 80 p.c. of
that is represented by tangible assets, de-
spite £104,603 standing to establishment
account and £3OOO paid for the goodwill of
the South African business bought from the
A.P.A. Net tangible assets on June 30
amounted to £238.016. But what is of most
interest to policy-holders is the statement
that “the amount lodged with various Gov-
ernments [£lls,ooo] as security is consider-
ably greater than the total actuarial liabili-
ties.’’ The Southern Cross is fighting to get
on to a solid basis. Whether it will succeed
will be governed by its ability to cut exes,
sufficiently to permit of bonuses to policy-
holders. Beyond that lies the establish-
ment account calling for reduction, and, be-
yond that again, the needs of shareholders
for some return. Their time lies a long
way ahead; and as there are 125,000 of
8 p.c. prefs. hungering for attention, quite a
big sum must be paid out before ordinaries
can get a crumb. Already divs. amounting
to about £16,000 have accumulated, and that
is being added to at the rate of £5OOO a year.
Those who bought 125,000 10s. ordinaries at
ss. premium probably ask themselves why
they did it.
Assets are in the following form: Public
securities, cash, etc., £118,929 freeholds and
fittings, £133,163. Those two items account
for 75 p.c. of tangible assets. The remainder
is divided into a dozen different items, in-
cluding book debts and outstanding pre-
miums £26,590. Stationery and motor-cars
are in at £6761 —a hefty item.
The Accident branch improved a little
owing to lighter claims. Exes., however, were
heavier —65 p.c. compared with 53 p.c. the
previous year. The fund moved from £6039
to £7106. Here, too, exes, call for the prun-
ing knife.

The reconstruction, with the gift of £125,000,
followed the 1924 meeting; and the issue of
125,000 ords. at par to shareholders, then
forecasted, was, of course, snapped up. Latest
accounts disclose an unexplained addition to
reserves of £29,937. Portion of that may
have come from profits won last year; if so,
and if the reserves with which it has been
joined are true reserves, the 12 months’
profits were greater than the table alleges.
Ords. were given 13f p.c., an<l for a time at
least holders are warned not to expect any-
thing better. Profits were big enough to pay
another 4 p.c.; but the directors are looking
ahead: —
The business of a newspaper is attended with many
problems, and the directors desire to impress upon
shareholders and investors their belief that their
policy of strengthening reserves... .is necessary if
the co. is to be progressive and strong enough to
meet contingencies which experience shows are likely
to arise. '
That reads dolorously; but the manner in
which the Sun leaped ahead ojf its old estab-
lished competitor in Sydney is not to be
forgotten, nor the recent history of the morn-
ing newspapers in the same city. Certainly
the Herald had much better luck when faced
with recent competition : yet even a rich con-
cern can’t go on indefinitely buying off people
who challenge its monopoly of the afternoon
bloodstain.
Further, there are risks which the accounts
don’t make conspicuous. Among the assets
are “Shares in other cos. at book value,
£151,037”; and there are contingent assets
against an equal amount of contingent liabili-
ties—on the one side “bank guarantees in
respect of United Press Pty., Ltd., and Pic-
torial Newspapers Pty., Ltd., £70,953”; on
the other side amounts due by those cos.
These are subsidiary cos., and the value of
the shares depends upon the profit-earning
capacity of the cos.; also, while there is no
doubt about the bank guarantees, there may
be a doubt about the assets of the cos. One of
the properties of the United Press Pty., Ltd.,
is Punch, whose publication, according to
recent reports, is to be discontinued. It looks,
therefore, as though some of the Contingency
reserve of £115,000 may have to disappear.
The directors’ policy is, therefore, a wise one,
even though it blocks any larger div. for a
while. To old shareholders the 13f p.c. is
very handsome. On the other hand, at re-
cent market prices the return is a moderate
5-1 p.c.^

Book debts (after “full provision”) amounted
on September 30 to £127,182, and £113,732
was “due under contracts of sale”; the
nature of this transaction —or transactions
—is not disclosed. The subsidiary formed
to carry on the Sun Pictorial is reflected
in the item : “Shares in other cos,” £151,103
(£5662 in 1924). Incidentally, it may be re-
called that the purchase price was said to
be £175,000, plus an annual payment for the
cable service. An increase in liabilities was
to be expected. Bank ovei-draft dropped
£14,000-odd, but sundry creditors expanded
by £81,951 to £149,268, while deposits rose
by £70,000 to £112,830. That position will
be eased if and as moneys due under sale
contracts are received. Nevertheless, the
total is heavy. The goodwill of £198,000 is
irrespective of the goodwill of the Sun
ITctorial, which is hidden in the “shares
in other cos., £151,037”; and there may be
more —some of the “amounts due by United
Press Pty., Ltd.,” against which the bank
overdraft has been guaranteed, may be repre-
sented by goodwill also.

That was the position at August 31. Of
course, it shrieked for remedy; and, it being
impossible to overlook such a shriek,
the directors recommended —and the share-
holders have agreed—that steps be taken to
write ss. off each of the 250,000 15s. shares,
the reduced shares to be then con-
solidated into £1 shares. This is the second
cut. Following the slump that fol-
lowed the post-war boom shareholders
decided to wipe ss. off each share and make
a clean start. Their calculations were, how-
ever, upset by subsequent developments. The
market has its doubts whether it is enough
to write off even another 55.; at any rate,
it values the scrip at ss. Yet the writing
down appears to have been about what was
necessary. With a run of average conditions
there should, in fact, be some recoveries—
for instance, part of the £5OOO put by against
doubtful accounts should be untouched. The
further heavy depreciation of stock appears
to have been called for. Slow-moving stocks
are bad profit-earners when competition is
keen, and results over the past four years
show clearly that there hasn’t been much in
if for Broomfields. The displacement of un-
payable departments by profitable lines seems
to offer the way out. For the moment the

financial position looks no better: there is
a mortgage of £25,000 besides other liabili-
ties of £27,577. Floating debt is, however,
well covered by more or less liquid assets.
It now remains with the management whether
profits will be won. As long as they stuck
to the ship-chandlery business prospects were
poor. General hardware seems to hold much
larger possibilities in Sydney. But the busi-
ness will take building. #
Hadfields (Australia), Ltd., a concern
specialising in steel castings, was given this
paper’s blessing some years ago, and success
was predicted for the industry. The success
has arrived: the plant is now turning out
any sort of steel castings, the various flavor-
ings of vanadium, chromium, manganese,
etc., having all been mastered; and actually
a higher standard of purity is set. than at
the parent concern in Sheffield, the pioneer of
the electric furnace steel-smelting process.
The latest important contract to come the
way of the firm is the making of castings for
the North Shore bridge. The first two pieces
were produced recently, the biggest being
33cwt. That is merely a toy, however, to
Hadfields, who have been making locomotive
parts weighing eight tons.
Frederick Valley Gold Concentrators
(N.S.W.) is the title of a no-liability flota-
tion designed to acquire and exploit a
patent concentrator devised by Leech and
Gordon, the vendors. The claim is that the
residues and sands in Frederick Valley,
which takes in the old Lucknow field,, have
shown highly payable results when subjected
to the new process. The machine is simple-
looking enough, two separate water units
doing the trick. The proposed co. allows for
150,000 ss. shares—7s,ooo to the public pay-
able in full on allotment, 45,000 paids to the
vendors, and 30,000 reserved. Out of an
estimated capital outlay of £18,750, the ven-
dors again come into the picture, this time
for £7500 for existing plant, leases, rights,
etc. Figures supplied speak of 160 tons a
day to be treated for a return of £152, from
which £57 deducted for costs gives £95 profit
per diem; and a net annual profit of £18,750
seems to have been calculated to the fraction
to balance the estimated capital outlay
aforesaid.
West Australian Manganese Co., Ltd., on
a “Wild Cat” par. (B. 5/11/’25)
The statement that the co. is weakly financed is
inaccurate, considering the co. will have a capital
of £150,000, which it is estimated is £75,000 in
excess of the amount required. We have a guaran-
teed clear profit in the home market, besides which
we can sell an output of 100,000 tons annually for
10 years abroad at highly remunerative rates.
The “Wild Cat” is glad to welcome a new
producer and especially one which may assist
Australian manufacture; but it still has no
great opinion of the finance of a co. with “a
capital of £150,000, which it is estimated is
£75,000 in excess of the amount required.”
The “guaranteed clear profit,” by the way,
comes apparently from two agreements for
the supply of an aggregate of 5250 tons, of
ore p.a.; whereas the prospectus calculation
of a profit of £125,000 p.a. is based upon an
annual output of 100,000 tons p.a. All the
same, the deposit seems to be a very fine
one, and there certainly should be an increas-
ing demand for the ore.

Wiluna flotation (W.A.) is being helped
by State Premier Collier’s endorsement of
ex-Premier Mitchell’s promise to build a
railway; by chairmen of most, and directors
of some, of the big Kalgoorlie cos. joining
the board ; by the fact that the whole share
issue has been underwritten, and by favor-
able reports by H. E. Vail, G. M. Roberts,
D. McAulay, H. E. Giblin, F. G. Brinsden
and other well-known Wedtralian mining
men. The most guarded of the lot are Gib-
lin and Brinsden, but even the former
reckons that “prospects are most favorable,”
and the latter has expectations that the
property “will prove very remunerative.”
From the mass of information concerning
Wiluna contained in official and other reports
The Bulletin gathers that the lodes there
arc found in an ore-channel 3J miles long
by two miles wide, and that the gold
deposits occur in formations which in many
respects resemble those at Kalgoorlie. Sur-
rounding country is said to contain a large
belt of gold-bearing rock stretching about 40
miles north and south and 30 miles east and
west; so there is plenty of room for wild
cats.

About two months ago Golden Horseshoe
(W.A.) induced the State Government to
guarantee it at the bank for £25,000 and
pledged its property, goods and chattels, etc.,
as collateral security. Since then it has
reported a series of deep-level finds which
look promising and may lead to a substan-
tial improvement in the co.’s monthly re-
turns. Anticipating this, the market has
moved up a little.
« » * #
The Oroya I,inks London office has issued
a circular extolling the prospects of sections
of the co.'s Kalgoorlie property and predict-
ing increased tonnage before long. Something
is also said about results with oil-flotation
experiments showing an improvement, That
is one side of the picture. The other side
shows that what was once a large portion
of the co.’s productive area is now aban-
doned in consequence of working expenses
outdistancing receipts.
Westralia is bucked up by Professor
David’s statement that more than the
35,000,0000 z. of gold already produced is
still contained in the unproved alluvial de-
posits of ancient river-beds there. One of
these rivers, David says, ran from Lake
Austin around the base of Mt. Magnet on
the Murchison, and eventually reached the
ocean near Dongarra. Another and prob-
ably larger and longer ancient river rose
near Lake Way and coursed southwaids
through country which is now covered by
a chain of mostly-dry salt lakes until the
waters were lost in the porous beds of the
sub-artesian basin of the Nullarbor Plain to
the east of Zanthus. The Professor declares
there can be little doubt that many pay-
able patches of alluvial gold will yet be found
along these old drainage channels. Although
he mentions only two of such channels, he
says there are others.

Bamboo Creek (W.A.) has just issued its

Great Britain, Emmaville (N.S.W.), paid
Is. on its 10,000 10s. shares in October, and
will repeat the performance before Christ-
mas. Half-yearly accounts at October 17
show that net income from all sources, in-
cluding tributors, was £4033 from 391 tons
tin oxide. This gave the co. £1137 net, but
only £9l remained after wiping out the debit
of £1045 at p. and 1., and reserves have been
drawn on for divs. Cash balances and tin
ore are stated at £l9OO, reserves invested
£2522, stores £1470. Creditors claim £1196,
and general reserve at £5OOO equals the co.’s
capital. The Britain plant extracted 3.081 b.
per yard from 22.861 yards, as against
2.671 b. per yard from 27,468 yards in the
previous six months. Y Creek had a poor
run, obtrusive cement being the worst factor.
Yield per yard was 1.46ib. against 1.281 b.
for the previous half-year, but tonnage fell
from 10 tons llcwt. to 8 tons lcwt.

Pond’s Creek, Emmaville (N.S.W.), which
had £2023 in hand at March 31, has re-
turned to the div. list after five years’
absence. The 13th, of 3d., is payable this
month; the 12tli (6d.) dates back to Dec.
15, 1920. There are 32,000 shares, so a
“thripny” requires only £4OO. Since the plant
was shifted from Rothschild to Nelson’s
Creek 30,360 yards has been sluiced for 304
tons tin, equal to 2|lb. per yard; but the
ground is so tough that extraction is slow.
Altogether the co. won 40 tons 14cwt. for
the year, but the profit was only £4l. Ray
Elliott, who succeeded J. A. McTavish when
the Scot went to Nawng Pet last year, con-
siders that the Nelson’s Gully leases, which
lie bored, should prove payable for a few
years with tin at £250 or more.
W. F. Lee, of Broken Hill, who examined
the N.T. Mica and Metals options in the
Macdonnell Ranges, lias reported. “The
mica,” he says, “is an enormous deposit in
reef formation. 15ft. wide, and easily cap-
able of a yield of 50 tons of good mica
annually.” At 100 ft. west from the present
workings there is good mica showing, “and
at 100 ft. east another outcrop produced two
good books of mica with the first hole put
in. This is a tremendous outcrop, and
should yield good mica for years.” Having
exercised the option, the Sydney co. is put-
ting on sufficient men to recover the 50-ton
estimate for the year. Louis Burkhard, re-
presenting Liverpool, N. York and Bremen
buyers, pronounces the mica equal to any-
thing lie has seen in Russia, India, Burma
and East Africa. Burkhard enthuses about
the prospects at 50 tons a year; and as his
firm takes the mica in an undressed state, the
cost of production should be light. Con-
sumers prefer to do their own splitting.

Carpathia (N.S.W.) is doing better

Tingha Tin (N.S.W.) is still in the dol-
drums. November output was only two tons
from 10,000 yards, or less than half a
pound, against 5f tons of pound stuff from
13.000yds. in October. Revenue fell from
£lllO to £386. But it wasn’t all the fault
of the ground. One week was lost trying
a new design gravel-pump.

Finney’s, Brisbane’s suburban silver-lead
show, is out after more capital. The man-
agement intends to push development along
the lines suggested by Dr. .Jensen and Gov-
ernment Geologist L. C. Ball. Shareholders
were informed at the annual meeting that
indications on the 175 ft. level tended to
confirm Jensen’s theory that the scattered
ore comes together between 175 ft. and 228tt.
Reporting in July last he said: “New dis-
coveries on these levels can make the mine
a div. payer instead of a hand-to-mouth
proposition.” Thus far £50,000 of ore has
been extracted, £34,000 being produced last
year.

Sardine Tin’s last crushing at Kangaroo
Hills (N.Q.) was 20 tons 12cwt. for 41 tons
of black tin, worth about £B32—-over £4O
per ton. On No. 1 level, which is in 47ft.,
the face shows sft. of 25 p.c. ore.

Kawarau and Amalgamated Kawarau, the
two Sydney floats which are to tear up the
gold paving of the Kawarau (M.D. ) when
the waters are dammed back at some elastic
future date, are seeking amalgamation, lhe
only clear statement in the notice is that
the directors want to “co-operate with other
claimholders in the formation of a co. _ tor
the general working of the river.” The idea
is to form a co. with a capital of £750,000.
The purchase consideration is to be £5OOO
per claim in 10s shares paid to 9s. 9d., the
co. to take over the uncalled liability to the
parent co. of £4OO per claim for the dam.
Amalgamation should produce economy and
a more equitable share in recoveries if
any. So far as this Column knows not one
claim has definite evidence as to the gold-
paving, so the proposition sef3ms fair
enough.

“Kerogen” on the Taranaki field: —
The fact that the Moturoa bore has admittedly
gone through the first oil sand reached by previous
bores in the district, between 2000 and 2300 feet,
without striking the expected “flow” oil surprises
nobody having a close acquaintance with the field’s
history. Since 1885 over 26 deep bores (upwards
of 1000{t.) and numerous shallower holes have
been sunk within a few miles’ radius of New
Plymouth. They proved an upper seepage sand,
producing a few barrels a day at first but rapidly
falling off. Another sand varies in depth from 2000
to 2300 feet; this produced up to eight barrels a
day per well maximum, increasing slightly at
3000 feet and 3700 feet, where two lower but
narrower sands were cut. Production ultimately
fell off until in 1916 the daily yield from all wells
was less than eight barrels ; and to-day is negligible.
The deepest oil bore in the Southern Hemisphere
was sunk by the Austrian Feodorowicz at Moturoa.
This bore, the best drilled on the field, struck oil
at 2170 feet, and by scientific bailing and swabbing
to minimise the “clogging” of the pores in the
sand bv the waxy oil, was made to yield 20 barrels
a day for two months. Then the water broke in,
and when the well had been deepened to 5000 feet
the production had fallen to one barrel a day and
to five gallons at 6000 feet. It was of course
abandoned. During 1907-15 the entire field pro-
duced one million gallons of crude oil and half a
million gallons of refined products at a cost of nearly
a million. It is significant that, away from Moturoa
and beyond a few “gas” shows, there has never been
forthcoming any direct evidence of seepage oil, nor
has any bore ever proved oil to be present in the
Miocene series, notwithstanding an active and exten-
sive deep drilling campaign m other parts of Tara-
naki. Evidence that Moturoa oil is purely local
and probably results from the distillation of the
Mokau coalbeds low down in the series is
found in the aromatic and phenolic nature of the
oil and the huge percentage of carbon-dioxide
present in the associated natural gas. It is also
more than a coincidence that oil very similar to
Taranaki petroleum can be obtained by the low-
temperature retorting of Mokau coal.
» * ♦ ■*
Mandated Development is advised by radio
from Matapau that No. 3 bore, at 250 ft.,
met signs of oil and a little gas. The drill
is punching deeper.
For 300 years oil and petroleum gas have
been known to exist in Timor; the gas fires
are considered sacred by the natives. The
Dutch East Indies produce 2£ million tons
of oil yearly, much of which comes to the
Commonwealth through the British Imperial
Oil Co. Petroleum was not produced from
the property now the object of purchase by
Timor Petroleum when Arthur Staughton,
the Vic. sauatter, took it up 20 years ago, be-
cause there was no proper scientific manage-
ment by oil men. When the war broke out,
Staughton had £74,000 subscribed, but the
Federal Treasury refused to sanction its
expenditure abroad.

Rawang (F.M.S.) bucket-dredge tore out
60,000 yards during November, and found
but 18 tons tin oxide. The lOoz. yield is
not good enough on the £240,000 of capital,
and some weeks are being lost, too, because
of a breakage.

November yield of Takuapa (Siam)
showed a big drop, only 39 tons Teing re-
covered —20 tons less than in October. Some
of the shortage is blamed on the pumps,
whose eccentric behavior lost several days.
These things, however, are all part of the
bucket-dredging game, and should be allowed
for in forecasting tin-oxide recoveries. The
first div. (of Is.) has been declared pay-
able on Jan. 14.
Nawng Pet (F.M.S.) got 22 tons tin oxide
for November from 36,000 yards, giving a
revenue of £3733 at a cost of £782. The
big dam, however, flooded the workings, and
December will be non-productive. The Tai-
ping ofiice considers that the damage to the
dam is not serious, and will be quickly
repaired.
* * * *
Ratrut Basin (F.M.S.) got 14f tons
oxide out of 76,000 yards from its new pro-
perty during November. If the operated por-
tion is an average, it means half-pound
ground—much better than nothing, but not
enough to pay fat dividends.

Kamunting (F.M.S.), with four dredges
going, turned over 3,393,900 yards for the
year to June 30, and extracted 1354 A tons
tin oxide, which produced £194,557 at a cost
of £63,335, and showed £132,222 profit on
working account. Office expenses were very
heavy, and taxation took £22,346. After
four quarterly divs. had absorbed £60,000,
£36,173 remained to carry forward against
£ll,BlO brought in.

“Simon Called Peter”; We sailormen get

Also the ornamentation is accepted as a
credential, enabling the wearer to get a ship

further testimonial. A not uncommon de-
sign on a sailor’s back is the Lord’s Supper,
due to the old belief that a man who could
lay bare this scene would never be flogged.

into their work. Thus one sailor who had

given Polly a flat nose and dotted her eyes
in the corners instead of the middle. Not
satisfied with this, he rigged her up in a

that there was another pebble in some other
port. Then there was the experience of the
Irish tar who explained to the Tokio
draughtsman that he wanted St. Patrick
banishing the snakes done on his back.
When it was too late he discovered that the
snakes had been featured with bells round
their necks, driving a Chinese mandarin off
the premises.

“O. Ren”: A couple of American scien-
tists have been investigating Tarcoola, out
on the East-West line. The place is worth
a visit. Apart from railway employees, it
has a population of about five humans and
1000 dogs. There was once a gold-rush there,
and the rushers who pushed through the v 360
miles of mostly red sandhills from Port
Augusta deserved more than they got. The
railwaymen still “pick around” the old work-
ings. But Tarcoola’s most arresting feature
is made of empty bottles, piles and piles of
them; any shrewd American would be im-
pressed with their marketable value in settled
territory, and would probably plan a settle-
ment to make use of them. There is a tradi-
tion in South Aus. that deceased bottle-ohs
go to Tarcoola to expiate their sins—the
place is a world of bottles and no one to buy
them. Beyond Tarcoola to the west there
are only railway cottages. It has the last
house and the last pub this side of Kalgoorlie,
over 600 miles aw-ay.
“.Tonesy”: The German “corpse factory"
yarn may have been exploded (B. 5/11/25),
but it will be harder to dissipate the idea
that the corpses of prisoners of war were
sometimes put to hideous uses. I was in a
prisoners’ camp when 200 poor devils who
had passed out (Russians) were carted m
waggons at night to the nearest railway
station and placed in trucks for some un-
known destination, notwithstanding that the
P.O.W. cemetery was quite near the camp.
Knowledge of happenings like these, com-
bined with the conditions in Germany in
1918, made men ready to believe anything.
Soap consisted mostly of sand; the people
wore paper clothing and wooden boots ; and
bread was made from rye, potatoes and saw-
dust.

“Six and Eight”: “Percy’s” immigrant (B.
26/11/’25) is not the only one who has
found Australian phraseology a pitfall. A
western N.S.W. cocky had taken the gross
THE THING THAT MATTERED.
“Well, I'm hanged if I know who began the argument!”
“Never mind, darling; remember that I finished it.”
weight of his tarpaulin-covered waggon of
hay, and then, assisted by a pommy em-
ployee, had loaded the hay into a railway
truck. It was the necessity of entering the
tare weight in the consignment-note which
made Cocky direct his assistant “to tare the
tarpaulin with the waggon.” Choom did it
during Cocky’s brief absence in the S.IVL. s
office. It sounds incredible, but it is a solemn
fact, that he tied one end of the tarpaulin
to the loading stage, hitched another to the
tail of the waggon, and then drove the team
full steam ahead. Cocky’s behavior when he
saw his tarpaulin in two pieces cost him, for
language and assault, the best part of £2O.
* * * *
“R.” : “Coot’s” mention of forgotten bank-
ing accounts (B. 5/11/’25) reminds me of
old Jack Sudder, an inveterate
share gambler. He received a
mulga wire about the likelihood of
Mt. Grey (W.A.) becoming an-
other Great Boulder, and feverishly
began taking stock of his assets.
There were tears in his eyes when
he came to me for the loan of the
fiver which would enable him to
indulge in 100 shares at 9d. Un-
fortunately I had barely enough to
see us through drinks for the day;
and that night we sat on .7 ack’s bed
in despondent mood. “There you
are,” grumbled the old chap, bit-
terly kicking open his dilapidated
box'—“filled with worthless scrip,
and now, when opportunity knocks
with a pick-handle, I’m without a
bean.” I commiserated with him
and began idly to prospect the rub-
bish heap. Presently I came on a
State Bank passbook, and opening
it discovered there was £52 to Sud-
der's credit. “Is this cancelled V”
I asked, and old Jack’s eyes bulged.
“You’ve saved my life!” he shouted,
jumping up. “I haven’t touched
that thing for six years—clean for-
got it!” A month or two la.ter,
when Alt. Grey gave up the ghost,
I apologised for finding the damn’ pass-book.
* * * *
“Chancery Lane”: England is not the
pioneer in deciding to “replace the repul-
sive broad-arrow prison uniform with decent,
respectable clothing” (B. 26/11/’25). Vic-
toria did so last year. At Pentridgo the
old-time garb has been gradually replaced by
new uniform, a circular patch of linen on the
left breast, bearing the letter of the prisoner’s
division and his number, being the only iden-
tification mark. In smaller Victorian prisons
and reformatories, no identification marks at
all are now placed on prisoners’ clothes.
* * * *
“The Traveller”: There is room for im-
provement in the system of carrying cheese
by rail in Victoria. At present it is dumped
loose into the guard’s van, along with rab-
bits in crates, parcels of skins and the like.
At each junction the cheese is thrown from
the van and caught, like bricks, by the station-
hands. By the time the commodity reaches
Melbourne —where everything goes—it may
have been thus man-handled half a dozen
times. The other day I saw bundles ot
binder-twine carefully sewn into hessian,
each bundle containing a dozen balls ot
twine. It seems reasonable to ask that
cheese might be covered at least as carefully
as binder-twine.
“Nikko” : An interesting revelation of the
authority of the crew of one of the big mail
liners was given to the guests at a dance the
other night. The ship had been in port
several days when the officers ventured on a
little mild frivolity, and the festivities had
been in progress for a couple of hours when
a peremptory order arrived from the crew
that the music—a gramophone —was to be
stopped. To the amazement of the visitors
the demand was obeyed, and after a silent
supper and whispered farewells the astounded
guests tiptoed down the gangway and silently
faded away.
■Jr * * *
“Grey Linn”: The visitor to Melbourne
who mopped up every species of booze obtain-
able and took the Melbourne Cup for some
beverage he hadn’t sampled (B. 5/11 /’25)
reminds me of the feverish curiosity on the
subject of alcohol displayed by one of Uncle
Sam’s sailors. I meandered into a bar at
Auckland in time to see an elongated gob
experimenting with various drinks, ranging
from Italian vermouth to half and half.
“Say, Bo,” he had rerharked to the barman,
“I want one of every kind of dope you have
in this joint.” The drink-dispenser had done
liis best to meet the comprehensive order with
an array of glasses containing all the better-
known varieties of snakejuice. The Yank
sampled a few one after the other; then lie
got tired of that slow process and, demanding
an empty “handle,” dumped the whole lot
in it and successfully negotiated the fearsome
mixture. The last I saw of him lie was
being carried gently away. But won't he be
able to talk when lie gets back home !
* * * *
“Hamer” Something resembling the story
of the mixed twins was told in connection
with the passing of two elderly brothers in
Melbourne. Found living in wretched con-
ditions at Drouin, the old fellows were sent
to the Old Men’s Home at Royal Park,
but the restrictions proved irksome, and they
left. Death was waiting for both of them;
one fell over a railway-bridge, and a few
days later the other was knocked _ down by
a train. At the first inquest the victim was
identified as Charles, but a policeman who
came down from Drouin for the second in-
quest declared that this was Charles’s corpse
and, being shown some of the clothing of
the first man killed, said it belonged? to God-
fried. Other witnesses gave tangled testi-
mony, one of them alleging that on Novem-
ber 25 he had given Charles a shilling, while
another swore that Charles had been dead
12 days on that date. As the matter stands,
there have been two corpses, two inquests and
two funerals, but the police are still uncer-
tain whether Charles was not officially de-
clared dead while he was still tottering about
the earth, and Godfried certified as having
perished under a railway-engine some days
after his funeral.

THE SPIRIT OF LOCARNO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“During the British occupation of Cologne 800
British soldiers married German girls.
The shafts from Cupid’s quivers
Knock enmities to slivers,
They skewer hearts (and livers)
From frozen Poles to Line.
These pacts pre-date Locarno;
Twin souls no line or bar know
Beside the Nile or Arno,
Why should they on the Bhine ?
They found —-and turned from hating—
The frauleins meet for mating,
Found them for kisses waiting
And didn't let them wait.
Aversions old and rotten
Were snapped like bitten cotton,
Antipathies forgotten,
Discarded Hymns of Hate.
They fell —but not to Ares ;
They fell —for flax-haired fairies.
O British Mauds and Marys,
O Jess and Jane and Joan,
Did fancies from you wander
Of fickle swains out yonder,
And make the exiles fonder
Of Gretchens at Cologne?
Did local charmers blind them,
While on the job assigned them,
To charms they left behind them?
And were they angled for?
What use to ask ? What matter ?
They’ve helped the statesmen scatter
The seeds of peace, to shatter
The bitterness of war.
Not only posts and sections
But feminine affections,
’Twould seem, in all directions
They occupied as well.
Grim Mars had ceased to thunder,
But, Venus’ batteries under,
The Tommies fell —I wonder
How many Frenchmen fell!

The Health Beverage
Sarto is made from the best Jamaica
Sarsaparilla Root prepared in accord-
ance with the British Pharmacopoeia.
Do not be put off by taking cheap imi-

you are just as good as Sarto.
There is only one SARTO, that is

“57th” : While enjoying one of its "rests,"
the 15th Brigade, commanded by “Pompey”
Elliott, was ordered on a route-march for no
discernible reason except a disciplinary one.
The prospect of hitting the trail in full
marching-order was distinctly unpleasant;
but somebody got a brilliant idea- —and lie
passed it on to the rest —with the result that
every man appeared on parade with liis pack
neatly filled with straw. Whether it was
the unusual neatness of the packs that
aroused suspicion or whether some non-com.
let the cat out of the bag is known only to the
C.Q. himself; all we knew was that we had

“You put up at the Hotel Excessive, didn't you? Did you bring
bade any souvenir?”
“Oh, yes, an empty cheque-book.”
not gone far when a halt was called, and the
order passed along for every man to empty
his pack. The ludicrous appearance of the
long line of little heaps of straw, each
guarded by a sheepish-looking Dig., must
have appealed to the 0.0.’s sense of humor,
for, apart from keeping us on top-gear tor
the rest of the journey, he took no public
notice of the joke. But I guess he had many
a chuckle in private.
“Wallaby”: On several occasions lately,
though mindful of the milk-jug, I had for-
gotten to put out the cat —an omission
pointedly brought under my notice every
next morning by my wife. Awakened long
after midnight by a rude strumming on the
piano, it came on me that I had been guilty
of another lapse of memory. Happily my
wife was still snoring peacefully, so, slip-
ping out of bed. I made for the drawing-
room and switched on the light. With a
meow of satisfaction and a reassuring lift of
liis paw Tabs bounded gratefully from the
piano-stool, accompanied me to the front
door and disappeared into the darkness of
the night. By chance, just before I switched
off the light. I glanced at the piano. The
song lying open there was Guy D’Hardelot s
“I K r ow a Lov<°v Garden "
« * # *
“Stripey”: Tne other morning two old
friends met for the first time in 14 years
in the yard of the police-station at Towns-
ville (Q.), each having been pinched on the
previous evening for his own good. What is
stranger still, the last time the pair had
encountered one another was in the yard of
the Cloncurry police-station under exactly
similar conditions. On that occasion each
man was cutting out a cheque, and the local
police had shot them both inside to keep
them out of the clutches of a gang of spielers.
When the two old chaps met at Townsville,
each remarked on the fact that it was the
first time he had been run in since the Clon-
curry spree. The arm of coincidence could
hardly stretch further than this.
'** * *
“Roekley” : My wife, shopping recently in
a Chapel-street (Praliran) emporium, was
accosted by a serious-faced youngster with
a request that she should “mother” him into
a Christmas show, conducted in its toy-
department. the performance being given
gratis to children accompanied by parents.
Seeing that the lady was wavering, he
pressed his advantage further by suggesting
that eight companions, who were discernible
in the offing intently waiting the result of
his application, could be his brothers and
enter the Golden Gate on the same passport.
Considering that the eldest of them was
about 12 and the “mother” has just become
eligible to exercise the franchise, the pro-
position was turned down cold.
* * * *
“Cue”: The early-day feminine figures,
such as “Cross-Eyed Sal” and “Toongabbie
Molly.” that flit through so many of J. 11.
M. Abbott’s sketches, remind me that W.A.
during the 18 years that it acted as a recep-
tacle for Britain’s “erring children,” was
spared female convicts. But in the' early
'sixties, when the disproportion between the
sexes was beginning to be viewed a little
apprehensively, officialdom sought to remedy
it by giving a number of women from Eng-
lish workhouses a free passage to Wcstralia
and a chance of being snapped up in the
under-supplied matrimonial market. One
chronicler of the period gloomily records his
opinion that if the ladies had come direct from
gaol they could hardly have been a less de-
sirable lot.
* * * &
“Sixenate": The person who exhibits
nervous consciousness of wealth is the most
likely to be relieved of it. A new arrival
from the country, apparently well posted
on the prevalence of light-fingered and heavy-
fisted gentry in Melbourne, went about the
city with a defensive hand over the pocket
in which he kept
his money. Every
crook he passed
noticed the protec-
tive clutch, an d
finally a few of
them pushed him
into a lane and
went through him.
More subtle indica-
tions ar e not
neglected by the un-
derworld. A house
at Kew was burgled
two days after the
owner had had bur-
glar ala r m s in-
stalled ; the instal-
lation was accepted
as evidence that
the place was worth
robbing by crimin-
als who had left
it untouched for
years. Per contra,
a shabby looking
drunk who wand-
ered through the
worst part of Mel-
bourne until locked
up by the police for
his own safety, was
found the other night to have over £5OO
upon him—nobody had bothered to molest
him.
* * * *
“Percy Pinktape” : Wireless surged into a
remarkable popularity in Australia, but the
inevitable slump came very early. N. S.
Wales was the first State to be bitten, and
for a time conversation on trams and ferry-
boats buzzed with remarks about statics and
crystal-sets; but 3513 sometime enthusiasts
allowed their wireless licenses to be cancelled
during October, and 3361 of them were in
the Ma State. The boom might have lasted
longer if the broadcasting firms had given
satisfying programmes instead of budgets of
too-evident advertising. Still the slump had
to come when the novelty wore off. There
is a man in Melbourne who claims that when
the Sydney-Melbourne telephone was brought
into existence he made 200 calls over it in
the course of the first year; since then he
has used it merely half a dozen times. The
year before last 1403 N. S. Walers took
flights by aeroplane—-mostly out of curiosity ;
only 651 soared aloft during the year which
ended on June 30 last. But this sudden heat
and sudden cold is no -new thing. Thirty
years or so back, when the cyelorama first
struck Australia, a co. was formed to build
and run one in Sydney. It paid four divi-
dends in the first six months —and not a
single one for 20 yearn afterwards.
A MILITARY OPERATION.
“Whatever is wrong with the Major?”
“Some woman has been trying to reach his heart through his stomaeh and made a mess
of it.”
“Canar” : Re the clan-signs of Paris crimi-
nals (B. 19/11/’25). Not long ago a
middle-aged foreigner was found dead in a
Melbourne lodging-house with the words
“TJn pegre jusqu’ a mort,” accompanied by a
peculiar floral design, tattooed on him. As
“pegre” means* thief the police were a little
puzzled that anyone should advertise his call-
ing so boldly. Actually the phrase is the
motto of the penal battalion of the French
Army, into which are received the' apaches
and the scum of Paris, besides those sen-
tenced for offences committed while actually
serving with the army. The Penal Battalion
is located permanently in Northern Africa.
Obviously, the dead man had served in the
unit.

“Tomb”: The last scene of the seamen's
strike at Gladstone (Q.) was staged on
the Mahia. The relieved captain was giving a
party on board when a commotion was heard
for’ard. The swivel lights on the bridge were
directed towards the scene of the disturbance,
and the glare disclosed a brawny Scotch fire-
man firmly grasping one of the strike leaders
by the neck and bashing his head on the
deck. Two other figures were lying near by
unconscious. When prised off his victim the
Scot invited any or all of the trouble-makers
to return for another helping. They didn't:
when resuscitated they left the ship and were
last seen heading south per boot. The way
of the agitator is harder in Queensland than
it was.
* . * * -X-
-“Herodot”: Opium-smuggling tricks arc
legion, but this was cleverer than most. A
large metal container was fashioned and
painted so that at a casual glance it looked
like an ordinary lump of coal. Inside this
the drug was packed and the container placed
in one of the empty baskets going back to the
collier alongside; if an official watcher
noticed it he would reckon it merely a lump
of coal left there by accident. Thousands of
tins were got ashore by this means at more
than one port in Australia before the Gus-
toms officers dropped to it.
* * * *
“Adamaseus”: Mention of queer names
fB. 15/10/’25) recalls a few. Dan Mayne,
of Windsor (N.S.W.), called his three sons
Colonel, Cardinal and Councillor. C. B.
Fitz Gerald, eminent Queensland barrister
and politician of the old days, constantly tra-
velled the country in connection with his
legal and legislative duties, and christened
three of his sons after the towns he liked
best. Their names are Muttaburra, Mitchell
and Aramae. P.S. —I know five members of
a Rockhampton family who are respectively
Letitia Matilda Essie, Sedborough William
Hamilton, Gwendoline Lydwid. Pauline
Mary Josephine and Ralph Stanislaus Mar-
cellinus.
* * * *
“A.E.Y.”: There are queer tastes in sui-
cide. An ex-inmate of the old people’s home
at Dunwich (Q.) bought a toy pistol and,-
placing the muzzle against the top of his
head, pulled the trigger. The bullet flattened
itself against the bone of the skull and re-
mained embedded under the scalp. He was
taken to the Brisbane General Hospital,
where after the bullet had been removed he
announced his intention of having another
trv later on. Discharged he turned up again
after a brief interval with a two-inch nail
driven with a hammer into the top of his
skull, and calmly informed the staff that he
had made a job of it this time. He had, too.
“Henpan” : There were some Tommies who
readily believed, that the feathers which
adorned the hats of the Australian Eight
Horsemen were plucked from our kangaroos.
But it was the sergeant of the Oxford and
Bucks regiment who asked us if we had
“any of those Aussie sixpences with the
bird and rat on them.” It didn’t annoy me;
but a big fellow from the Northern Rivers
(N.S.W.), prouder of our coat-of-arms,
said he’d swap one for any English coin with
the poodle and the eunuch on it.
“Louden” ; The English language remains
a pitfall for the foreigner in business. One
day last week a Dago who keeps a cheap
hash-house in Melbourne had this notice in
large letters hung inside his window: ”3
coarse meals, Is.”

THE ELK-HOUND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A new breed of dog has been introduced into
England, the Elk-hound. It is said to be a good
domestic dog. One of its recommendations is that
it subsists almost entirely on a fish-diet.”
Away with cocker spaniels, and with dachshunds
and Borzois,
And wirehairs and retrievers, and your Pekinesy
toys!
Your Sealyhams and setters may be pretty, I’ll
agree,
But the fish-devouring Elk-hound is the only hound
for me. ’
He turns his back on bacon and he turns his nose
from ham ;
For sausages and saveloys he doesn’t give a damn.
He may be big and clumsy, but he’s absolutely
swish, ,
And no home should be without him, for he mainly
lives on fish!
You may leave the curried chicken on the table
over-night,
And the Elk-hound sits and looks at it, but wouldn’t
touch a bite.
If you locked him in the kitchen with a marinaded
steak
You’d have your work cut out to keep the animal
awake.
Cold mutton leaves him cold, indeed —he wouldn’t
take a lick—
And as for pork or partridge—why, they simply
make him sick !
But offer him red-herrings with a wipe of bloater-
paste,
And half a six-pound turbot that the cook has cut
to waste,
A dozen blue-point oysters and a bit of salmon-roe,
And you’ll have the devil of a job to see the way
they go!
Of course he’s most expensive and he doesn’t, earn
his keep ;
And that’s no joke, as prices are, unless your pocket’s
deep.
But though he’s not a bit of use —not even good
with rats—
Remember that he never mouths your Missus’ Sunday
hats.
And though the neighbors say “Of all the good-for-
nothing brutes!”
He never chews your macintosh or masticates your
boots.

Charlie Skerrett, who is to step into the
shoes of Stout, C.J., next February, is the
leading member of the M.L. Bar. Ilis legal
career extends over 40 years, and he took
silk 18 years ago. A particularly good man
before a jury, adept in the ringcraft of the
courts and phenomenally successful in get-
ting verdicts. Skerrett has built, up the best-
paying practice in the Dominion ; he won’t get
as much money on the Bench. He has never
played politics in the ordinary way, but is
father of a semi-political organisation, the
Welfare League, which has done, its best to
sweep back the rising tide of Bolsh by writ-
ing letters to the newspapers about it once
a week. Unlike Stout, whose tastes are
those of an elder, SKerrett is a sport, and on
race-days he gives up his silk for a particu-
larly audible and saucy check.

“.T.G.F." (Moresby) : Matt Crowe, Papua’s
greatest gold-finder, has washed his last
dish. A poisoned leg and subsequent
amputation were too much for the old
battler. A great philosopher and humorist.
Matt smiled at hardships that, discouraged
stronger men. When he discovered the
Yodda goldfield he literally had to fight his
way through the hostile natives of the
country, and his civilising work and his dis-
covery of three valuable goldfields entitle
him to be remembered as one of our greatest
pioneers. Monuments have been erected by
Governments to far less deserving men.
The Senate will get a brisk recruit in
A. J. McLachlan (S.A.). He is a born
fighter, but with a good temper and a strong
sense of humor; he would be the typical
Irishman if he wasn’t Chief of the Caledo-
nian Society in S.A., and he was once C.O.
of the Scottish Corps, too. As a young man
he was a partner of C. C. Kingston, and new
has a fine commercial practice. A keen
.sportsman, he is among other things chair-
man of the Football League in Adelaide.
He was born in the Mount Gambier district

Tattersall’s Club, is his brother.
The Yarraville (Melbourne) branch of the
A.N.A. has made a presentation to F. A.
Kruse, of Footscray, by way of recognising
him as “the Father of the Association.” The
old chap, born in Melbourne 79 years ago,
was one of the foundation members of the
Stawell A.N.A. in 1879. His father helped
on an industry that has made poor progress
—he was designer and builder of the City of
Melbourne, the first screw steamer launched
in the Southern Hemisphere.
W. A. Hamilton, who has just got back
into the S. Aus. Assembly on a by-election
for East Torrens, had six years as its mem-
ber before being defeated last year. As a
young man he was in Victoria for 29 years,
being manager of a co-operative bakery in
Bendigo, and he was an early Labor member
for that city in the Vic. Assembly. Since
returning to S.A. he has been a Liberal and
manager of a Fruitgrowers’ Association; his
father was one of the early winemakers on
the Adelaide plains.
Died at Perth, aged 53, Dorham Longford
Doolette, son of the late George Philip
Doolette, the Adelaide tailor who took up
mine-promoting as a side-line during the W.A.
boom of the mid-’nineties, and went back to
England with a pile, a portion of which he
used for buying a knighthood by a handsome
contribution to the fighting fund of the Con-
servative party. The Golden Mile boom made
the father, and the son was mainly respon-
sible for the Bullfinch boom of 15 years later,
which lifted him, too, into temporary afflu-
ence. “Dorrie” was a mine manager at
Mount Magnet when a prospector whom he
was financing pegged out the Bullfinch on
the Yilgarn field ; the mine was rich on the
surface, but it was too outrageously over-
capitalised to be of any value to anyone ex-
cept the promoters, and the litter of w r ild
cats that leaped up on every side were
responsible for nothing except scandals and
swindles and blasted hopes. Still out of the
Bullfinch boom (and burst) came the finding
of the Westonia field, from which good re-
turns were obtained for years. The younger
Doolette had a literary turn, and wrote some
capital verse for The Bulletin and the
Kalgoorlie Sun before fortune came tapping
at the door.
Two Judges had birthdays on a recent
Sunday—Adrian Knox, Chief Justice of the
High Court, who was 62, and Leo Cussen,
Vic.’s Senior Puisne Judge, who is 66. Both
were called to the Bar (Knox, of course, in
N.S.W.) in 1886; Cussen had spent a few
years in civil engineering before he took to
the law. Knox spent four years in the
N.S.W. Parliament between 1894-98. Both
men earned professional promotion in 1906,
Knox taking silk and Cussen a Supreme
Court Judgeship.
Fortune has smiled upon Pat Sullivan
since, 16 years ago, he left Australia, where,
in those days, Hie lot of the black-and-white
artist Was hard and the road overcrowded.
For a while Sullivan starved on work for
Ally Sloper and similar “comics,” but
when, after arrival in America, he struck the
idea of “Felix the Cat,” since syndicated
to scores of papers and produced on the
films, prosperity came in a deluge. He now
works oil the key idea of his pictures, em-
ploying others to fill in the details; and his
staff for producing Felix draws £4OO per
week. Marketing Felix as a toy has added
to his profits. With his wife he arrived in
Sydney last week by the Narkunda.
Andrew M. Wooldridge, of Goodwood Park,
near Adelaide, one of the very last of S. Aus.
old-time squatters, has passed out in his 85th
year. Wooldridge opened up country in the
Gawler Ranges in the sixties of last century,
and wool from there was included in the first
shipment to England. He formed Arcoona
station north-west of Port Augusta 50 years
ago. Before rail communication he went to
Melbourne, where he sold to W. Campbell, of
Sydney, 2500 square miles of country near
Innamincka, unfenced and hoofless, for
£lO.OOO. Wooldridge’s holdings, included
1000 square miles north of Nor’-West Bend
station, 600 square miles on the N.S.W.
border, and Tilcha (1200 square miles) on the
Queensland border. With David Murray and
J. B. Spence he leased 20,000 square miles
about Barrow Creek in the early ’eighties,
and stocked it with 11,000 head of cattle.
“Sir Sol”: There will be few ziffs in the
next House of Reps., and none among the
new men, wdio are principally of middle age.
Foster, Maloney and West are the only
bearded members, and the elder Riley is the
sole owner of a grey head. South Aus. has
the fairest and darkest members in Yates
and Lacey respectively. The youngest-looking
Rep. is Gardner: the tallest is Killen; the
most robust is McGrath; the smallest is
Lazzarini. The keenest debaters are Hughes
and Scullin, and the finest orator is Watt.
Bruce is the coolest and most collected
speaker, Brennan the most sarcastic, Makin
the most assertive, Stewart the most
independent, Chapman the most irascible,
and Forde the most loquacious. Anstey is
the House’s humorist and the gallery’s
Prof. DOUGLAS MAWSON, of the South
Polar Circle and Adelaide University.
favorite; “Texas” Green has the most rau-
cous voice, Duncan-Huglies the gentlest dis-
position, and Malcolm Cameron the least
heard tongue. The mildest-mannered trio —
it is difficult to choose between them—are
E. C. Riley, Hunter and Atkinson.
Queensland’s first Professor of Law is
Dr. P. W. ('umbrae Stewart, who has been
Registrar* of the University since its founda-
tion in 1910. The appointment was made
possible by Miss Cecie Garrick’s bequest of
£lO,OOO for the establishment of a chair
in memory of her father, J. F. Garrick,
Q.C., a former Attorney-General and
Treasurer. Cumbrae Stewart is a D.C.L.
of Oxford, and was a barrister of the Inner
Temple before being called to the Queensland
Bar. He has edited the Queensland law
reports; and if there is a local literary
society he hasn’t joined it is because be
hasn’t discovered it. He will be 61 next
month, but is an energetic young chap.
“Uramao”: “Kiwi” (B. 5/11/’25) errs
when he says that Francis William Ogilvie
Grant was digging potatoes when news
reached him of liis succession to the title of
Lord Reidhaven, paving the way to his suc-
cession to the Earldom of Seafield four years
later. When Grant was appraised of his
good fortune after a lifetime as farmer,
fisherman and general laborer, lie was doing
duty as bailiff at a farm near Oamaru ; fur-
ther, he refused to be relieved until the
farmer paid up.
Conscientious South Aus. has resolved to
do without any Rhodes Scholar for this year.
Competition is generally fierce, but this Lime
there were only two applicants ; and the com-
mittee decided that neither had the required
combination of unusual brains, muscle and
leadership-qualities. Of the previous 22
holders, about half are doctors, and these are
mostly back in Adelaide; so are the two
lawyers. The science men have scattered
more. One was killed in the war. The first
of them all, Norman Jolly, has lately been
appointed Director of the Federal Forestry
School and an Adelaide professor in his sub-
ject. Cecil Madigan is a lecturer in geology
at Adelaide University, and Frank Williams
is Government Anthropologist in Papua.
George Rymer, president of the Railway
Union, is the storm centre of Bananaland
industrialism just now. He got himself
pushed out of the A.L.P. executive some time
ago, and is now conducting vigorous press
controversies with Valentine (secretary of
the Loco. Union) and Carroll, a colleague
on the Transport Strike Council. He is also
engaged in a feud with Premier McCormack,
whom he dubs a strike-breaker, and pursues
vendettas against various Labor politicians,
the A.W.U. and the Worker. Rymer lashes
out furiously in the Railway Union journal,
the Advocate, which he edits; but he has
so much to say about his Labor opponents
that he overflows into the hated capitalist
press.
There’ll be no more wanderings for Henry
Alexander, who, coming to Australia 75
years ago, was caught by the lure of gold,
and thereafter pursued it in Maoriland,
America and South Africa, diversifying his
gold-seeking adventures with others among
the American Indians, in the service of the
Hudson Bay Co., and in making excursions
into Brazil, China, Japan and India. But
always he came back to Australia, and there
seemed some chance of him settling down in
Melbourne when, at the age of 90, Death
made certain of it. Besides earning a crust
as sailor, whaler, gold-seeker, hunter, trapper,
vigilante scout, pedlar, odd-job man, axe-
man and mechanic, he was a musician of
some parts, and capable of fair work with
pencil and brush.
Monsignor Bonaventura Cerretti, who was
Apostolic Delegate to Australia between 1914
and 1917, lias been made a Cardinal. It is
rarely that anybody under the age of 60
wears a Cardinal’s startling millinery, and
the conferral of the hat upon Cerretti at the
age of 53 is a tribute to his exceptional quali-
fications for diplomatic service. He recently
had the high honor of representing the Vati-
can in Paris.
Catherine Pollard is Vic.’s first woman
Oddfellow, having been admitted recently to
the Collingwood lodge. Two sisters are to
follow. Oddfellowship is a family habit,
papa Pollard having been a brother for 36
years.
That fine old navigator, Commander H.
G. Evans, is showing around Australian
shipping offices a golden barrel he received
in London before starting on this his last
voyage as skipper of the P. and O. Nar-
kunda. The barrel is not a bacchanalian
emblem, but was presented to him by grate-
ful English and Australian cablemen at
Cocos Islands in recognition of his frequent
charity in heaving overboard casks of fresh
food and literature for the exiles on the
coral fragment where the Emden got her
packet.
“Naklioda”: Three Melbourne youths,
Rupert Howard, Billy Ward and Frederick
Perry, have just started out to walk around
the world. They arc ploughing through a
fair amount of Australian soil at any rate
—going via Adelaide and Perth to Broome,
where they will take ship to Singapore. I
met a circumnavigator in an Asiatic seaport
once who asserted that he had walked across
Europe, Africa, the two Americas and Aus-
tralasia and was now about to plod through
Asia. Questioning elicited the information
that his Australasian itinerary had been
from Wanganui (M.L.) to Wellington, Wel-
lington to Melbourne by steamer and Mel-
bourne to Sydney per hoof. I am going on
one of these walking tours myself as soon as
I have saved the steamer fares.

“I WAS WITH GRANT.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At the declaration of the poll for Barton
(N.S.W.), Mr. McDonald, the defeated candidate, said
that one cause for Labor’s set-back was the inclusion
of the name of Donald Grant on the ticket for the
Senate. He had never hesitated to express the
opinion that the day Donald Grant stood on the
Labor platform, smash it would go!”
“I was with Grant,” said the stranger—-“yes,”
And into the dust he spat.
Quoth the other: “Not Ulysses S. ?
Your face is lined, but I hardly guess
l r ou’re quite as old as that.
“Full forty years ago he died,
And pull my leg you can’t
With tales of fights by the General’s side.”
But. the other musingly replied:
“My oath ! I was with Grant.”
“What Grant, then? Many a Scottish clan
That patronymic claims.
Was it one of the Seafield branch, old man?
Or was it your youthful fancies ran
To the martial books of James?
“Were you mates with one of the fighting Grants
Whose chests the medals gem ?
Or was some learned son of the manse
Your cobber once?” But he growled askance:
“It. wasn’t any o’ them.
“I was with Grant —on the Labor card
In Noo South Wales. Anon
The voters belted us good and hard
Because we played in the same old yard,
As you might say, with Don.
“If was he who set my schemes agley
And my cherished hopes aslant.”
Tie spat once more, did that pilgrim grey,
And “I curse,” he gloomily said, “the day,
The day I was with Grant.”

“Nikko”: The idea that an article that
has been handled has absorbed part of the person-
ality of the handler (B. 5/11/’25) is not confined
to Black Brother. There is at present a woman
in W.A. who must have collected thousands of
handkerchiefs from believers in this theory. She
undertakes, on receipt of a new handkerchief, worn
next the sender’s skin for a day, to reveal
the future, but at latest was imploring intending
patrons to hold off, having apparently been snowed
under With “wipes.” She will, she states, resume
business later, presumably when the present lot
have worn out.
“Ninety Nine” : When visiting the diamond
fields at Copeton and Boggy Camp, Inverell dis-
trict (N.S.W.), I was assured by old hands there
that one has to be very watchful of ants when
temporarily putting gemstones on a rock or the
ground. First-class rows, ending in dissolutions of
partnership, happened in the early days of the field
owing to diamond “scratchers” accusing their mates
of stealing stones ; then one day an ant was caught
red-handed in the act of tugging a diamond off a
flat stone on which it had been placed while the
owner went on with his work of sieving' wash-dirt.
A half-dozen ants between them had trundled the
gem well along towards their heap before it was
rescued by the fossieker. Being an unbeliever, I
iested the yarn for myself, with the predicted result.
The explanation is apparently that, by handling the
gem, the trace of perspiration from the fingers still
clinging to the stone attracts the ants, whose sense
of smell is highly developed; they, doubtless, regard
it in the nature of food, and therefore worth storage
room.
* * * *
“Alastor”: Long Jim, a well known kan-
garoo-killer, of Springsure (Q.), swears to this.
Whilst ’roo-shooting at Florida (N.S.W.), the pro-
perty of William Grace, he potted a kangaroo, and
in an attempt to kill it with a stirrup-iron was
pulled off his horse by the ’roo, who made off
with the leather round its neck. Eight years later,
whilst kangarooing at Moonie River (Q.), Long Jim
shot a fine ’roo that had some kind of entanglement
round its waist. On closer examination he found
a stirrup-leather marked “Florida”; and now he
wonders how the marsupial negotiated the fence on
the border between Queensland and New South.
* * * * ,
“Black Tracker”: Has a climbing cow
been discovered by any Abo. writers ? A northern
farmer in South Aus. reckons he has one. As there
always has been trouble with her calves owing to
her strong maternal instinct, the
latest arrival was taken from her
immediately after it was born and
hidden in the loft of a hayshed some
distance aw T ay, while the cow was
turned out in the paddock. On the
following morning the mother was
found in the loft with her calf.
There was no doubt about her mak-
ing use of the ladder fixed to the
wall, for both bore traces of a
struggle having taken place before
she did the trick. All her legs were
badly skinned. And she had to be
lowered with a pulley-block,
“Moe” : In N.Q. there is a
firm belief that to sleep close to
a pawpaw-tree bearing fruit is
to risk unpleasant consequences.
Stories are told of children who
have become sitkly because these
trees were close to their sleeping-
places, and I recently met a man
who solemnly assured me that the
same thing happened to him at
Cairns some time ago when he slept
on a verandah alongside which
were three actively-flowering trees.
Within a few days he began to
suffer from headaches and gastric
troubles, accompanied by pains in
his. arms and legs, for which he
could obtain no relief, while he
also experienced general lassitude
and weariness during the daytime.
He was not aware that the presence
of the pawpaw-trees had anything
to do with his condition until
somebody suggested that perhaps
such was the case, He then moved
his sleeping-quarters to the other
side of the house, welll away from
the trees, and almost instantly re-
covered. In the North the belief
is so generally accepted that many people will not
have a pawpaw-tree close to their houses.

“Bill II.”: Tell “Cosine” (B. 19/11/’25)
that in drought times west-o’-the mountains (N.S.W.)
there is no hope of finding a drink abush other than
by seeking out a watercourse or dam. On the ocean
side of the Dividing Ranges it is different. There
the thick vines that hang from nearly every tree
in the east-lying jungles hold water. To extract it,
a high-up, downward, slantwise incision is made,
and then the vegetable hawser is severed near its
root. The pint or two of water that will trickle
out will be gummy in flavor, but a good enough
drink for a thirsty bushman. Along the seashore
a drink of water surprisingly fresh and delightfully
cool may be obtained in many places. Midway in
the sand-strip that holds back a salt-water lake
from the ocean a hole scooped to two or three feet
in depth will fill with dear water. It has the
slight taste and after-effects of magnesia, but it makes
good billy-tea, and it was Binghi's constant water-
supply alongshore.
“Jcsmoud”: Tell “Pish Crook” (B.
19/11/’25) that pigskin usually comes from meat-
works and canneries, which do not treat pork with
the skin attached as the housewife does. Bilt not
one per cent, of the “pigskin” saddles he sees are
pig-leather. The common imitation stuff is ordi-
nary leather bleached and pricked by a mechanical
process which also gives the leather a slightly
crinkled surface. Real pig-leather can be recog-
nised by its hardness and freedom from this crinkle,
FEARED THE WORST.
SOUP-DRINKER: “ Well , anything the matter?”
INTERESTED ONE: “Oh no; I only thought you had fallen in”
and by the fact that the pricks are always in triangu-
lar formation—something like .’ . One hole in
each series contains the remains of a bristle; the
♦ other two ai;e always empty. Machines can stamp
leather in this manner, but no inventor has yet
devised one to fix a fragment of bristle in every third
impression.
“Saddler Simon”; Pigskin is invariably limited
to the seat and pads. Apart from its pretty marking
there is nothing special about it. Lacking “nature,”
after a time it is liable to crack and tear over the
cantle. Cowhide of soft tannage, called bag-leather,
at half the price, can be relied upon to out-wear
it. English hogskin is the best, though before the
war Germany was getting in well on price with a
quick-tanned and much inferior article. There is
next to no hogskin tanned in Australia. As usual,
we let the tail go with the hide, or rather the hide
go with the bacon.

“C.11.R.” (B. 19/11/'25)
thinks that a eucalyptus-tree growing in County
Wicklow is the only one in Ireland., It isn’t. I
know T of several fine specimens flourishing at Dirreen.
County Kerry. Anyway, they were there not so long
ago.
* * * *
‘‘Pick” : That no bullock when hitched to
a bull can long bear the strain (P>. 12/11/’25) is
due to a difference in the shapes of the animals.
A bull invariably has an abnormal hump extending
along his neck to that part of his shoulders where
he gets his shove. The bullock’s neck is slender,
and for him only are the yokes and bows fitted.
Immediately that a pull-altogether is required, the
bull, heaving forward in his ill-fitting gear, has a
tendency by the irregular shape of his. neck to
twist the yoke and thereby bring a pressure of the
bow against the bullock’s throat. Soon that tortured
chap will have his tongue protruding, and in few
instances will he stand up the distress beyond
an hour or two. But the bullocky who works a
bull in his team is as rare as the one who harnesses
up a cow. Rusty bullocks are unsafe enough to
handle without taking on the positive danger from
a never-to-be-trusted bull.
“Jimmy Possum” : I don’t know how old
“Jim Carew’s” young Australian was (I missed
“Jim’s” par.) who yoked up 18 bullocks on his
lonely (B. 5/11/’25) ; but I can assure “Bill R.”
that the feat would be quite possible for a willing
boy. My old dad assures me that he performed the
impossible time and again long before he was 11, and
drove the team into the bargain. In order to put
on and fasten the yokes he had to mount a chair,
and more than once was sent flying when an un-
willing bellower objected to being yoked by a kid.
Though I regularly harnessed up horses before I
was 10, I never had a go at yoking bullocks till I
was 15. Even then I thought I was too young for
the job; but not because I wasn’t tall and strong
enough.

“N.K.C.”: Ecliuca (Vic.) lias a fine
avenue of date-palms in its main street. These
grow freely in the neighborhood, even on rubbish-
heaps, from discarded date-stones, and most of the
houses boast one or more palms. Yet although small
dates hang in clusters below the palms none of
the fruit has ripened. One enthusiast explained this
to be due to lack of fertilisation, since the male
date-palm did not grow in the locality. He believed
that at Mildura male date-palms had been imported,
and matured fruit was the result. Can any abo.
enlighten me?
“Te Whare”: It is true, as “C.” (B.
19/11/'25) gently liints, that the Australian bird-
names are somewhat tangled and indefinite. The
white-throated flv-eater (Gerygone albigularis ) is
usually accorded the title “wild or native canary,”
as it has a sweet, trilling song, fairly well sustained
at times, and has a fair amount of yellow in its
apparel. It builds a long, pendent nest, something
like that of the yellow-tailed tit-warbler, but without
the separate (hamber, occupied by hubby when his wife
is squatting on the pure-white eggs, which charac-
terises the yellow-tail’s incubator. This fly-eater is
migratory in habit, and chiefly frequents Eastern
and Northern Australia. 1 have met him about
Mittagong and in far South Coast (N.S.W.) scrubs.
The familiar and friendly “yellow-bob” (yellow-
breasted shrike-robin) also masquerades as “wild
canary,” but, except in the matter of raiment, has
no claim to the title. So far as vocal powers are
concerned, I think the whistlers (reddish-or golden-
breasted), when oft matrimony bent, have the best
right to the canary name. The song of these
birds when pairing is extraordinarily sweet and
trilling, also full and often fairly long-sustained.
A laughing-jack, on the other hand, when courting
merely squats on a bough beside the lady of his
choice, ejaculates “Kook-ook-ook,” or something like
it, in her ear, and she is his for better or w’orse,
for that breeding-season at any rate. Theffe is, of
course, no true canary among our birds.

“E. C. Dearman”: “C.P.” asks (B.
15/10/’25) whether a sheep has been shorn in less
than two minutes. The record for machines belongs
to Bill Higgins, with 406 shorn in nine hours. His
tally was made under ordinary shearing conditions
at Moumahak'i (M.L.) in 1924. Bill has shorn 23
sheep in 20 minutes.
THAT’S FIXED.
CHOOM : “I can’t work to-day; it’s 103 in
the shade.”
DAD : “Yairs, but you ain’t goin’ ter work
in the shade.”
“D. Ennis”: How does cocky build his
stacks waterproof? I know one who built stacks
of hay that stood two and a half years without any
thatch, and during that time they had 72in. of
rain pelted on to them. I saw them cut into chaff,
and, except a few black sheaves on the roof of
each stack, there wasn’t a damaged part, and the
chaff sold at top prices. I’ve had over 40 years’
experience, and have never seen a hired stack -
builder that could build a stack that would keep
out an inch of rain without thatch.

THE INLANDER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here, where days and nights surrender
To a lassitude of splendor,
Where mirages drift and float,
Where the gum-leaves, long and slender,
Orientalise the skyline and the mountains dream
remote,
I am somewhat sadly longing
For the crowds of Sydney thronging,
For the lights and nights of Sydney, wines and ices,
table d'hote ;
And some cigarettes, please note.
As I’m riding slowly under
Skies of cobalt-blue, 1 wonder
If that cumulus to west
Means a visit soon of thunder,
Pyrotechnics of the lightning all along the leafy
c rest.
While the butterflies and midges
Haunting now these terraced ridges,
Dancing airy, fairy ragtime, for a magic while
suggest
Cabarets, and all the rest.
Magpies in the bloodwoods carol,
And a parrots bright apparel
Flashes past in gaudy style.
While a gun, a double-barrel,
Down the gully barks at rabbits and is silent for
a while.
But a subtle scent, elusive,
From some secret flower, conducive
To romancing, wakes a dream that it were wiser to
beguile
With pretences of a smile.
THE EXPERTS.
TREVORROW : “Cap’n do reckon puttin’ next ’ole perpen-
dickler up ’ere. Wha’s ’ee think av un?”
TREDINNICK : “I do reckon slantindickler ’cross ’ere ’d
tear better.”
TRETHEWEY : “Thee knaws nawthin’ 'bout it, all av ’ee.
Circundickler in ’ere be best.”
For the days and nights surrender
To futilities of splendor,
Here, where distances are blue,
Here, where gum-leaves, long and slender,
Waft their eucalyptine odors on the crest of Wooroo-
koo.
And 1 dream of those past, golden,
Glowing hours of life and olden
Sights and sounds and nights of Sydney, all the
high delights we knew,
And of friends there not a few.
Yes, the girls there, and the shining
Lights where Sydney crowds are dining....
But what sentimental rot
To pretend that I’m repining
For the lights and nights of Sydney and for pleasures
unforgot!
For if I were back there, dreaming,
With the traffic round me streaming,
I would soon be longing once again, for this remoted
spot,
Would I not now ? No, I'd not!

A MESSAGE TO AUSTRALIAN MOTORISTS
How One Man's Brains put £4,000,000,000
Worth of Automobiles on the Roads .
The Automobile is now one of the greatest factors in our business and
social life—and right throughout the Commonwealth the motor is render-
ing invaluable assistance to the development and progress of Australia*
Have you ever given a thought to the capital invested in the 250,000 cars on Australian
roads to-day __ approximating over £75,000,000 and the vast service they are
collectively rendering to the citizens of this Continent ? Have you realised that it was
only through the invention of the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre that the development of the
World’s and Australia’s automobile transport was made possible* To-day there are
over 22,000,000 cars in the world which cost motorists, &c., the huge sum of over
.£4,ooo,ooo,ooo—and they owe their existence to the Dunlop Tyre. What a debt
civilisation owes to the late J. B. Dunlop.
A remarkable fact is that the fundamental principle of the pneumatic tyre is the same to-day as it was
in the year cf its birth—lBBB. But what a wonderful advance has been made in its development—its
ability to withstand almost unbelievable stresses, and render service that is astounding considering that
only rubber and cotton are incorporated in a motor tyre. The wonderful mileages being obtained by
the majority of motorists is a tribute to the advance and efficiency of the motor tyres of to day—in the
ranks of which— the “Dunlop" is still supreme and dominant.
In Australia—with its rough roads and tracks—the conditions call for tyres of special construction to
ensure long and satisfactory trouble-free service—and in this respect Australian made

offer motorists tyre service unsurpassed for mileage, comfort, dependability, and economy.
No better tyre is made in the world —and few as good.
The wearing tread and walls do not cut and chip, thousands of miles of travel showing only a smooth
even wear. The casing is made of the finest and strongest fabric that the world can produce—and the
Dunlop method of construction provides an ample reserve of strength to withstand the roughest of
driving. The Dunlop tube is also a fine production, being of the finest quality and ample thickness.
Dunlop Tyres are not built down to a price—but to ensure that every Dunlop user will receive full value
in miles and at a lower cost per mile than obtainable from imported tyres. We aim at him op
her coming bacK for more.
The Dunlop is the premier tyre of Australia
and sets the standard for quality and service.
There are many advantages to be derived from their use—and not one disadvantage. This
being so, we respectfully suggest that motorists now using imported tyres should—when
buying replacements—give preference to the Dunlop, to their own benefit and the benefit
of Australian industry. No sacrifice is entailed—you save money in
your initial purchase and in the big mileage that you are
certain of obtaining.
May we supply—through your garage—your next require-
ments? Our Mills—the largest in the Southern Hemisphere—make Dunlops in all
popular sizes in Cords and Balloons. If you are not already in possession of a Dunlop
list your garage will supply you with a copy—or we will mail one with pleasure.

•‘NOT THE SAME AS OTHERS.”
MALTHOID
A GENERAL WATERPROOFING FABRIC,
THE PARAFFINE COMPANIES INC., D. S. EVANS, Australasian Manager, CIIALLIS HOUSE, SYDNEY.
“ Jimpo”: It is not only gardeners who
have strange notions concerning the influence of . the
moon (B. 29/10/’25). I know numbers of farmers
who wouldn’t dream of killing a pig or a bullock
when the moon was full, their belief being that meat
killed at such a time cannot be cured.
* * * *
“Nitric”: “Werrimee” is right in taking
“Diggeroo” to task (B. 19/11/’25) for not cutting
into the sapwood when ringbarking. The bottom cut
is always made a little upwards to prevent suckering,
and if a little sapwood is taken off it prevents the
growth of new bark. The suckering will occur when
ringbarking is done at the wrong time of the year—
now, by the way, is the time when the sap is “up.”
As “Werrimee” says, the tree always dies from
the top, and this is because the storage food-
material sent up in the heart-wood (tylem) from
the roots is further treated by the leaves (the chloro-
phyll or green coloring matter also assimilates the
carbon from the carbon dioxide of the air), and
these “factories” send the nourishment to the rest of
the tree by the sapwood. It is this sapwood which
must be cut to prevent the perfect circulation of the
food materials. That is also the reason why a ring-
barked tree may stay green for-months—there is
sufficient food above to sustain the life of the foliage
for a considerable time.
* * * *
“Ranger”: In the N.Q. tropical scrubs
grow many trees containing properties that might
be of value to science. The “fever” tree grows in
the low scrubs. Its diameter is about Ift., and its
height about 50ft. The bark is yellow and intensely
bitter, and possesses some of the qualities apparently
of quinine. The poisonous river tree grows generally
at the mouths of saltwater creeks. Gash the bark
and you get a milky juice which is so volatile that
it is almost impossible to gather a cupful of it.
A drop of it falling into the eye has been known
to cause blindness. Inhaling the stuff gives the
sensation of sharp burning in the throat and
causes sore eyes and headache. The natives use it
to cure ulcers. The scrub poison tree is soft-grained
and elastic. Its juice is pure white and somewhat
similar to that of the poisonous river tree. A
splendid adhesive can be made from the juice, but
the material is very dangerous to the eyes. The
weeping-myall is a tree that should be bringing in
many thousands a year to the State. Its scented
wood is hard, close-grained and beautifully marked;
bushmen make splendid pipes from it.
SUCH A LOVELY COLOR-SCHEME.
“Now, Mr. Woop, please DO show me some
of those fair, flaming cows you are
always talking of.”
Pfella” : I don’t accept “Polycarp’s” state-
ment (B. 22/10/’2f>) that Binghi’s taste is like an
emu’s. When Bill Tanner, a white shearer, was
married in the nor’-west of W.A., a great spread
was planned in honor of the occasion, the table being
loaded with every eatable to be procured in the
great lone land—mutton, beef and vegetables from
the stations, wild turkey from the plains, fish and
oysters from the coast, canned fruit and all other
tinned goods the station chef could lay his hands on
in the storeroom. At the time Black Jack, an abo.,
was the station rouseabout, and accustomed to having
his meals on what was left after hisi white brothers
had finished. The wedding banquet was timed to
start at 2.30 in the afternoon, fully an hour later
than Black Jack’s ordinary dinner-time. While
everybody was in the front room seeing the knot tied
he decided to fill his empty spaces. He sampled
everything until his nose brought him to about a
dozen slices of hot toast, on which was spread a
thick, dark paste. 7 Its taste so tickled the nigger’s
palate that he was polishing off the last piece
when the cook rushed in and furiously booted him
off the premises. “The flamin’ black devil!” howled
the culinary expert. “Nothin’ will do him but
the best! Must eat the savory of Rooshian caviare
-—the only two tins of it I found in the store-
room !”
* * * *
“Trevdee” : Nine times out of ten when a
dog gets a good dose of strychnine it means the end
of its life ; but Queensland blacks, and quite a
number of bushmen, know of and -use a cure. It
is. to cut off portion of the poisoned dog’s ear or
tail, and thus bleed him; if this is done as soon
as he begins to show the effects of the poison his
life may be saved. Has bleeding been tried in cases
of strychnine poisoning of humans ?
* * * *
“Coppertop”: “Jimsey” (B. 19/11/’25)
needn’t have any doubts—apple-trees suffer from
lightning like the rest of them. At Stanthorpe
(Q.) he will find wild and cultivated apple-trees the
worse for shocks. 1 have in mind an old orchard
which was allowed to “go bush,” and there 1 saw
fully half a dozen trees splintered. Another place
in perfect condition had an apple-tree struck while
I was sleeping about 200 yards away. I can vouch
for it with all the more assurance because 1 had to
clean up the mess.
1 .W.J. : Jimsey” asks if anyone has seen a
wild apple-tree struck by lightning. Yes —a* fine
big, shady one at that, and in full bloom. I
saw the actual strike: the lightning came down with
a zigzag course to the top of the tree and there
exploded. It was the finest sight I ever saw; but
theie was not a limb left on it afterwards. This
happened February 4, 1883, at the junction of
Stockyard and Smith Creeks (N.S.W.).

Ben Zine”; For weight and value I nomi-
nate a pure-bred Friesian bullock, bred by A. E.
El worthy,. of s - Canterbury (M.L.) and exhibited
by A. Keith at the Dunedin winter show'. Coming
off grass, he w’eighed 36641 b. ; a fortnight later fie
went 2cwt. less. He is reckoned to be the heaviest
ox in Australasia up to date. With prime ox beef
at 655. per 100 wholesale, and after deducting one-
fifth loss in killing, he is W'orth, hide included, £9O.
He W'ould dress out a nice little carcase of 1 ton
4cw't. lqr. 201 b. !
“Tamornie”: “Broome” (B. 17/9/*25) is
not quite right. Certain of the sea-snakes cannot
progress on land, but the grey-ancl black-banded sea-
snake can and does. In the N.-W. Pacific Islands
these 1 eptiles come ashore during February and
March, and are found 30 or 40 yards inshore. Their
movements are slow. I was once investigating the
fangs of a six-footer on Ngo Island, near liaewieng,
when, touching the poison-sac with a twig, a jet
of liquid was sprayed a distance of about 15in.
The snakes mentioned by “Broome” and “Kriz”
aie unlike land-snakes in their general make-up,
but the banded sea-snake, with the exception of
the eel-like tail, not noticeable at first glance is
not dissimilar. They also have scales. Several of
the other varieties are more like an eel and are
slimy to handle. When one is noticed in the water
where the Kanakas are swimming there is a frantic
scramble to the beach. They say that a bite is
sudden death.
* * *
“Bill Ding” : The craze for change in build-
ing has spread to birds. There is on view in an
agricultural machinery shop in Perth a crow’s nest
w'hose foundation is wire of about Jin. gauge, both
stout and hard; yet the crow has turned it about,
thieaded it in and out and formed a nest
calculated to defy any willy-willy likely to strike
it. There must be chains of wire in it.
* * * *
“The Rumpus” : “Herodot’s” cunning rats
(B. 29/10/’25) wouldn’t have much chance of
demonstrating their cleverness in our factory in
Perth. For years we were troubled by the rodents,
and set traps and poison without reward. The 2in.
piping for our fire-hoses ran throughout the build-
ing about 18ft. high along the brick wall, and
passed through division partitions, leaving holes large
enough for a rats’ highway. One day- the factory
electrician was hit on the head by an iron bolt
thrown at one of the travellers, and this incident
set him thinking. The result was some special wiring
where the rats ran. Once they stjruck these naked
shockers their travelling days wear done.
* * * #
“Nikko”: Re “Papi” (B. 5/11/’25) and
eai thquake psychists. The faculty of sensing an
appioaching earthquake is undoubtisdl}' possessed by
certain people, particularly natives. The Wairoa
Maoris before the big eruption of 1886 were filled
with foieboding. This sensitiveness is also possessed
by animals. An American journalist going home
a couple of hours prior to tihe ’Frfcco shake found
all the horses in a huge delivery stable in a state
of panic, and all hands out trying to quieten them.
Of the great Mt. Pelee outburst it is recorded that
for three days before earth-tremors, were noticeable
birds and animals streamed from the vicinity of
the mountain.
“Gagi”: The explanation of “Papi’s” “psychic
forecaster” of earthquakes is simple. The Maori-
land earthquake is simply a large earth “tidal wave,”
preceded by smaller heapings-up of the earth-crust
-similar to the small wrinkles that flicker to the
edge of a pool before the “big upheaval” when a
boulder is heaved in. “Papi’s” friend felt these
smaller disturbances, just as a sensitive person can
feel the first waves in the pool when others of less
impressionable clay have, as the Irishman said, to
be drowned before thtey recognise that the water
has risen.
“Gouger”: A warrior of warriors among
the Cape York Peninsula abos. is the alligator-man.
Almost every coastal tribe boasts one, with his
attendant satellites. The hero earns his ’gator’s
teeth when the tribe runs short of tucker, and an
alligator has been located in a waterhole from
which the running stream has dried up. Two long,
cable-like lengths of lawver-cane are cut, a slip-
noose is fitted on one end, and the cane twisted to
give it greater strength. The cable is then lowered
into the water, and the warrior dives. The ’gator,
lying uneasily on the bottom, is not perhaps in the
required position. Daringly—but with a daring that
THE NEW SETTLERS.—“SURROUND ED BY SAVAGES.”
knows every trick of the great lizard —the abo. jerks
at the tail-tip or sharply levers a stubby- leg, then
vanishes surfacewards. The ’gator dare not leave the
hole, being scared by the noisy preparations on the
bank above and the threatening dives of the black
streak that comes fearlessly to manhandle his body.
He edges towards the bank —just where the w'arrior
wants him. The ’gator’s jaws, claws and tail are
hemmed in, and he can move only one w'ay. The
abo. glides under the bank, with the outstretched
noose in his hand. The ’gator’s head lifts at his
approach, and instantly' the noose is slipped well
over the jaw's. Then the whole tribe on the bank
above tug like demons to drag him into water
shallow' enough to enable them to fill him with a
sheaf of spears.
“Centre”: I stumbled across a bush grave
recently a little w'ay off the road out beyond Charle-
ville (Q.). The mound was crowned with the re-
mains of a petrol case, on a portion of which some-
one had burned—apparently with a heated piece
of fencing-wire—this epitaph: “Below here lies the
body of Chuck, the best cobber a man ever had, and
a better bred dog than the blanked blanker that
ran over him with his motor-car.”
* * * *
“J.H.” : Four of us in a camp on Smith’s
Creek (N.Q.j recently listened to a wonderful piece
of mimicry. The N.Q. grey bower-bird who gave
the display sat on a low bush not seven feet from
the nearest of his audience. The imitations of a cat-
and-dog fight, the barking of a fox-terrier and the
plaintive meowing of a stray puss, followed by birds’
notes and human voices, were done with wonderful
proficiency. One wonders why those interested in
the protection of Australian bird-life do not move
to have a sanctuary proclaimed for such gifted
birds. As it is, they are being steadily pushed into
the wilds, their quaint bowers being much scarcer
than they were a few years ago.
* * * *
“Gembrook”: Can any Abo.-writer throw
any light on the warryta-tree, mentioned in
“Rambles of an Australian Naturalist” as growing
on the lower slopes of the mountains east of Adel-
laide? The plant is described as having a low
black trunk with a great crest of large, coarse, grass-
like leaves resembling a grass-tree. From the tuft
of leaves there springs a tall stem, at the top of
which grows a huge cluster of vivid scarlet flowers.
“Boomerang”: The abo.’s version of the
Creation (B. 22/10/’25) resembles in broad outline
our own Biblical story. His belief, however, regard-
ing the origin of animals, fish and birds is in-
verted. These creatures had originally been abos.,
and immortal, but for their misdeeds they had been
changed into the lower forms. For instance, the
porcupine had been guilty of such misdeeds that
his whole tribe rose against him and buried their
spears in his flesh. He was then driven out, con-
demned ever afterwards to creep on all fours, with
the deeply-embedded spears or quills in his body, a
warning to others.
“Henry Pannikin”: Put this among the
queer accidents. Jabez Garde, a stockman on Gandi
(S.Q.), was rounding up stray steers. During a
breather he fancied a smoke and drawing his pipe
from his pocket, charged it with loose tobacco in
his jumper pocket. He then applied a match. There
was a report like a pistol-shot: a cap had got into
the pocket and, mixing with the weed, had been filled
into the pipe. The horse bolted, and when Garde
pulled up the stem of his pipe w r as sticking through
his cheek. For weeks afterwards he reckoned the
bowl of the pipe had gone down his neck. For-
tunately it hadn’t.
* * # *
“Returned Empty”: Can any of the Abo.
Council tell me how long a. ligature should be left
on in case of snakebite, and what to do after
its removal ? Recently a lady promptly applied to
a man victim a ligature, and after using lancet and
crystals sent the patient by ambulance to the hos-
pital, about five miles distant. He soon recovered,
under treatment, from the snakebite, but it was
weeks before he got rid of the effects of the ligature,
which had been on his leg for about 2j hours.
* * * *
“M.G.”: For the information of “C.” (B.
19/11/’25), the term “bush canary” is, in Queens-
land at least, applied to the tiny Gerigone cantata,
probably the smallest bird in Australia and certainly
one of our sweetest singers. Whether the “canary”
appellation is due to the song or to the bird’s
color I can’t say. The song is infinitely superior to
that of any canary I ever heard. The mite’s colors
are greenish-grey on back, shaded lighter towards the
under parts, and the breast might be called a very
pale yellow'. Its beautifully-woven hanging nest, with
its top and bottom compartments, is a constant
source of interest to bird-lovers, and many a camp-
fire argument centres on the question of what pur-
pose is served by the top compartment. The most
popular bush theory is that it is built to deceive
the goanna, which pirate, finding it empty,
passes on without exploring the low T er deck. I
agree with “C.” that it is time the matter of
ornithological nomenclature w'as placed on a more
satisfactory, basis, flow about a re-naming confer-
ence by tlie interested societies? The school-papers
of the various States could be made the medium for
familiarising the rising generation with the chosen
names.

WOMAN'S
LETTER

GLOVES
The Tony Horderns lent Retford Hall —at
any rate, its tennis lawns and gardens—for
the fete in aid of the Crow T n-street Women’s
Hospital. In the bright sunshine of the
day the gaily-hued hats of the assistants, the
exotic sunshades and the multi-colored sum-
mer frocking of the visitors wove a tapestry
as crowded and brilliant as those hung in
the ballroom. These latter were from China,
and in them Princes of the Ming and the
Manchu with humane instinct let their caged
birds loose for their hour of liberty in the
afternoon air, while themselves reflected on
the torture adequate to an entire village of
which one inhabitant had breathed sedition.
Beautiful coats and Mandarin robes w r orked
in gold, in vermilion, in purples and in
blues displayed their stories and symbols to
eyes that could not read their meaning, but
could marvel at the cunning with which they
were wrought. The collection belongs to
Mrs. Thornett, and includes an ivory bed-
spread, once the property of General Gordon,
every knowm bird and most of the insects of
the great land of China worked into it. Miss
Preston Stanley very Roman-looking in
speckiess white, her black hair crowned by
a small white felt hat- —opened the fete from
the steps of the ballroom which overhangs
the harbor from the end of the garden.
Henry Braddon was another bigwig of the
afternoon —only an earwig this time, though,
for he didn’t make a speech. Mrs. Tony Hor-
dern, in a wide blue hat and a flowered
georgette coat, was active in the cause;
Mrs. W. C. Upton, Mrs. George Earp and
Mrs. Sly were others on the quarter-deck;
and Mrs. H. S. Dettman, Mrs. Donald Fraser
and Mrs. Donald Esplin helped to man the
craft.
The roses and the jacaranda and the
summer moon having gone to the Femiuist
head, the Club gaily hung out the lantern
of Carnival on a night of last week. Beauty
of the days that are no more billowed into
the lift of the King-street headquarters, and
Pompadours with their towering head-dress
bridged the chasm of time with airy nonchal-
ance to consort with members of the Ku-
Klux-Klan. The assembly-room, very brave
in a frock of red and yellow streamers and
a bobbing, swaying fresco of balloons, was
the area of activity; and here the Quite
Contrary Mary of history, bushrangers,
Mexican bandits, Carmens, Fijian belles and
maids of old Japan fought to a finish with
the jazz band. Ruby Rich, in orna-
mental panniers that might have knowir Ver-
sailles, looked her most attractive, and the
Club’s clever secretary, Edith Rowsell, made
an impressive Lady Teazle. Mrs. Liddell
pinned her faith to black georgettes and
sequins; and Miss Preston Stauley enfolded
herself in a mask and domino and went un-
known till the supper hour.
Brass trays gleaming in the sun ; brass
pots dimpling suddenly from the shadows;
candlesticks as curly as a stick of sugar-
barley ; baskets woven of strong and subtle
colors (only wonderful surprises, like gin-
ger and honey, could be carried home in
them)’, wooden horses sturdy and sure;
dissipated yellow ducks with a leering smile
—these made the Market Day at Rose Hall
memorable; and for the rest there were the
usual stalls piled with fancy goods and lucky
packets of sweet stuffs. The attendance was
thin in spite of the good cause, and the stalls
beneath the tall trees conducted trade with
that unruffled suavity which is the distressing
sign of slack business. However, a band
cheered things up on the side lawn, and tea
in the pleasant dining-room lured all but
the smallest, who fell thrall to the ice-cream
lady. That staunch soldier’s friend Miss
Rose Piper was at her post; so was Gladys
Owen, who presided over the stall of Calen-
dars. These had been bucksheed for the cause
by different members of the Women Painters’
Society. Judge Rolin’s lady made the open-
ing speech.
Mrs. Mary Irvine, who left her job as
secretary to the Country Women’s Association
to shepherd a party of gallivanters under
the Pickford flag in the New Year, was
given quite an ovation when she appeared
at Rose Hall last Friday afternoon. The
C.W.A. staged the farewell to her in the
living-room of the Red Cross institution for
two reasons—first, because the lady had been
cne of its first commandants during the war;
second, because Friday was the day of the
Fair, and Mrs. Irvine was on the spot from
early morning. From Quirindi, Armidale,
imerell and half a dozen other back-country
districts came women to the party; and
when Mrs. James Ashton spoke of Mary
Irvine’s wide popularity, there was a clap-
ping of hands that made a fine imitation of
a sudden hailstorm. A mountain of flowers
and one of those embossed leather writing-
pads that t.he soldier-hands turn out so beau-
tifully were thrust on the voyager to the
accompaniment of a dozen or more pretty
speeches.
The Country Women’s Association proudly
announces that the additions to Keira Hou'se,
the holiday home for back-country mothers
and kiddies, will be finished early in the
New Year, and so an even greater number
of sea-hungry women will be able to see and
bathe in the tumbling green hills of the
Pacific off Deewhy. But the achievement
which the C.W.A. tries to speak of with
modesty is the gaining of reduced railway
fares all the year round for these health-
seeking holiday-makers.
Botany Bay will go down in Australian
history for other things besides the landing
of that navigating gentleman, Captain Cook.
It is the place that mams the fall and the
rise of Squadron-leader Wackett’s seaplane,
the Widgeon—the first Australian-built
amphibian. Six months ago on her first
trial she got self-conscious and nose-dived,
but the other day she took off beautifully,
skimmed over the sea, floated through the
air and attained a speed of 100 miles an
hour.
The first performance of “The Planets”
in Australia is due to the kindness of Mrs.
James Dyer, of Melbourne, who lent the
score to the director of the Sydney Con.
She herself came up from the South for
the performance. The whole Con. staff was
as excited over the event as a girl over her
wedding. They all helped in any way they
could, particularly the pianists, so Henry
Penn played the drums, Dorothy Gibbes the
celeste and Ramsay Pcnnycuiek the oboe.
This is a May Moore study of Lucy Sulli-
van, the energetic secretary behind the
Roderic Quinn
testimonial. A
first step to-
wards the
fund that is to
help the poet
o f sunshine,
now fallen up-
on the hlacu
day of ill
health, is the
concert at the
Gonse r v a-
toriu m to-
night. At it
Lawr e u c e
Campbell will
recite two of
Rod’s poems,
“When I was
Twenty - one”
and “W he n
Arnold Rode
B e h i n d.”
Alfred Hill,
who has set three of the poet’s songs to
music, will play the accompaniments; and
among the singers will be Charles Smythe.
Ella Shields will give one of her male im-
personations, and Rene Maxwell will help
to make the welkin ring.
The glories and riches of Evelyn Brun-
ton’s wedding, are still filling the pages of
the letter-writers among the guests; and
there were 200 of them, no less. How the
invited and uninvited were pressing into St.
James’s by a quarter to eight, and how the
floral dressing of that historic place absorbed
the eye till the arrival of the bride, has been
duly noised abroad. Gladioli and Madonna
lilies were a warm whiteness on the altar,
thrown into relief by masses of great palms.
Hydrangea, iris and gladioli bloomed again on
each guest-pew in company with festive bows
of silver and pink tulle, forming an effective
avenue for the bride’s gold frock. This was
of the luxurious lame, and scintillated with
gold beads and diamente; and if the flowers
on the pews had been sunflowers, an im-
portant bit of research work in color vibra-
tions might have resulted. A cascade of
golden orchids rippled from her arm, and a
pointed coronet of gold moored the Limerick
lace veil to the dark head. Evelyn herself
was moored to father's arm till the altar
rails and the bridegroom, Beauchamp Eric
Lawsou, were located. There was only one
bridesmaid, cousin Gladys Brunton, from Mel-
bourne, dressed in pomegranate pink geor-
gettes and a fortune in pink-toned gladioli.
Dr. Micklem, with the assistance of an aviary
of choir boys, tied the knot; and pretty niece
Nancy Marsden, in white moires, sang while
the last link was being forged in the vestry.
Gladswood, the Spencer Brunton home at
Double Bay, disguised as an Empire horti-
cultural show for the occasion, provided
jazz in its halls and wedding presents in its
billiard-room (a cheque for nearly a thousand
pounds the bride kept safe in the palm of
her glove), and wonderful foods and drinks in
a marquee that might easily have been mis-
taken for Wembley. And here the cake —
a towering affair of square tiers, carrying
innumerable doves and true-love’s knots —
was demolished that all might dream.
The bridegroom's mother, who had in-
spected the glories by day but was not well
enough, for the frivol at night, had some of
the party, all the same—a basket brimming
over with pansies, lavender and wall-flowers
reached her while the wedding festivities vyere
at the zenith.
The C.S.R. had a wedding in the family
the other night when Edgar Potts (he's
originally of Adelaide), the company's over-
seer at Ba, Fiji, married Phyllis Thomas,
whose father is the company’s chief eheqiist.
The ceremony cheered the evening hours of
St. Swithin’s, at Pymble, which is the bride’s
home suburb; her wedding garment was the
usual froth of satin and pearls and drew a
foaming trail of rucked georgette in its wake.
The veil was a mellowed web of Brussels
lace, and her flowers were orchids and sweet-
peas. Sister Barbara and tiny Marjorie
Ormiston lent color to the bride’s party in
flowered chiffons of greens and golds, J. T.
Arnheim best-manned ; and after Padre Noble
had scrutineered the final vow, the bride’s
parents coo-eed the guests to the homestead,
where Mrs. Thomas, in dove-grey and a hat
that was black and picturesque, superintended
the disintegration of a cake that even to the
casual observer carried a particularly heavy
armor of sugar.
Another big event that caused a stir during
last week was staged at St. Mary's, and Maud
Butler of Dobroyd Point and Bernard Craw-
ley of Roseville were the principals. Father
Boyle (Hunter’s Hill) and Father James
Dalton made the pact more secure than the
Locarno Treaty. The bride’s frock mingled
in picturesque cunning old lace, silver lame
and rose-petal pink satin, and over all bil-
lowed mists of tulle. Sister Queenie maided
in blue and silver brocades, while Frank
Burke best-manned. A notable feature was
Cousin Josephine Marks’s singing of Gou-
nod's “Ave Maria,” while the bride and
groom were making their exit. A dinner
dance at the Ambassadors rounded off the
function.
Maisie Bogle, a pretty sister of the well-
known cricketer Dr. Bogle, was married to
barrister Charles Stuart at Singapore in the
last days of October.
Popular Muriel Bridge will be the bride
of this week. Her little date with Dr.
Andrew Brenan is for to-day (the 10th) at
St. Patrick’s. He’s a brother of Jennie
Brenan and one of Melbourne’s pathologists.
Parties have simply raged from Kirribilli to
Rose Bay to Muriel’s glory this past week,
and a pink lunch spread by Mrs. Dan Kelly
at Waranilla is responsible for a rosy glow
through the whiteness of the trousseau.
General Brand won’t have all the farewell
parties before packing up for his new duties
in Melbourne. There’s to be one at the
Ambassadors on December 18 to say a re-
luctant good-bye to his gentle, brown-eyed
wife, most tactful of her sex. The
affair is emanating from wives of officers of
the N.S.W. Staff Corps and Base head-
quarters. Both the General and his lady
come from Bananaland.
Up in the Australian Hall on a stifling
afternoon last week an unusual audience
viewed an unusual play. It was as old as
Christendom, being indeed the drama of the
Passion of Christ; and its appearance here
was before an assemblage of nuns from the
city convents. Father James Kavanagh's
“Golgotha” was the work, and the performers
were a company of boys from Riverview
College. The story followed the lonely and
breaking heart from Gethsemane to the
Cross, and the groupings in the Trial scene
and the repentance of Judas were grippingly
effective. Bruce Anderson's Judas was out-
standing; and remarkable in a world of
slipshod speech was the enunciation of the
performers. Harry Thomas and Father D.
J. Finn were the producers.
This is Pixie Harris, once of Adelaide.and
now of Sydney, whose “Pixie O. Harris
Fairy Book” is coo-eeing from the stalls.
Profusely
ill us t r a,ted
with pictures
of the faery
denizens of sea
a n d green-
wood, the book
should please
all kiddies.
The drawings
and some of
the verses are
the work of
Miss Harris,
but most of
the stories are
b y Lynctte
Yardley, o f
Sydney, though
Eva Lawton
(Broken Hill)
and Gwen M.
Cock (Sydney)
have sharp-
cnod a quill to
help the pleasing production. Miss Harris’s
work is known to Bulletin readers; in fact,
she owns the distinction o£ having had her
drawings published in almost every Sydney
weekly, monthly and quarterly.
The beach around Clifton was as animated
as Deauville or Manly on the day last week
that the sailors’ wives and children decided
to hold their Christmas bean-o on its sands.
The band from the Sydney outplayed the
murmur of the sea-waves, sad or merely
fretful, and games and races for the young
things were so well arranged that everyone
got a prize. Commodore Wardie brought
daughter Jean; and Mrs. Robins, as lady
of the captain of the Port, was decorated
with a posy by the wife of Commander
Pope. At the close of a hot afternoon the
prizes were presented by the Commodore,
and then, at the very end of everything, sec-
retary Betty Corbett took a minute off to
listen to three cheers that she found to her
astonishment were in her honor.
Monte Carlo night at the Ambassadors was
quite a matey affair, with proprietor Stewart
Dawson footing it in the throng, and manager
Romano at midnight shedding his austerity
and blooming into the breeks of grand-opera
while he sang the overture from “Pagliaeci.”
It was generally a merry throng that eas a d
up the daily yoke in the shade of the peach
and plum which blossomed at discreet inter-
vals about the underground palace. Here
and there a slim girl waratah or water-lily
or a billowing Georgian belle threaded in and
out. among the dancers, but most of the bare
sex stuck to the sequins and satins and
lames and the 1925 vogue. Unless her lord
was indeed a mighty hunter; then her rai-
ment was subsectioned accordingto the prophe-
cies for 1926. Before the night had told many
of its warm soft hours, Phyllis du Barry, in
a eabaretted version of Flora, showered the
multitudes with the roses heaped in her car,
drawn by a ballet of joyous handmaids.
Max and Babette, whose last address was
the Bal Tabarin, Paris, danced in an un-
believably fantastic and breath-taking
fashion.
Pat Sullivan, the Sydney man who made
a fortune out of a cat, was on the Nar-
kunda, which tied up at Woolloomooloo on
Thursday morning. Felix he calls his gold-
mine, and it has been on a hundred films.
He did a characteristically good-hearted
thing on the voyage—made a drawing of
Felix, and added it to the barrel of letters
and papers that the ship dropped over the
side as she passed Cocos, the lonely cable-
station in the Indian Ocean where what’s
left of the bones of the Emden lie. Sulli-
van's father is in Sydney: they will have a
fortnight together; then the son and his
wife will go on to America —it was there
that Felix made liim film-famous.
Over 400 Diggers are still receiving treat-
ment in Rtuidwick Military Hospital. Fre-
quent operations are still found necessary:
a recent week's list included two amputa-
tions. The opticians, dentists, nerve and skin
specialists, as well as the staff of physicians,
arc among the country’s best; and the X-ray
plant, donated by a generous patriot, and the
pathological department are equal to any-
thing anywhere. Much voluntary work is
still regularly done by honorary specialists,
Red Cross members and women teachers.
There are occasionally a few female patients,
too, a permanent one being ex-Matron Cam-
eron, who was badly injured when the Hun
torpedoed a hospital ship.
Writing from N’York, youthful art-
student: Daisy Douglas Dowse, of these parts,
now working hard in classes at Columbia
’Varsity, mentions that a landscape of hers
in oils has been hung in the annual show
of the Art Students’ League in N’York.
St. Vincent’s has appointed Dr. Ray
M filler one of its new house surgeons. The
son is a chip of the old block, his father
having been house surgeon at the hospital
for five years. Dr. Muller’s surgery in Eliza-
beth-street is as well known as the town
clock to the poor of Sydney. The second
son, Harold, is studying dentistry.
If you want your friends to remark on your
never-failing good taste, wish them a Merry
Christmas and a Happy New Year on one of
those charming prints of Lionel Lindsay’s
Etchings of Old Sydney. These photogravures
have faithfully reproduced the exquisite lines,
the grace and the atmosphere of the originals.
The subjects are full of interest for Austra-
lians at home or abroad, being of that historic
if not stainless past when our ancestors, con-
vict or freeman (God help them !), were lay-
ing in the sweat of their brow, stone upon
stone, the beginnings of the City of the
Pacific. The series includes “The Commis-
sariat Stores,” “The Girls’ High School,” the
Hogarthian “Old Markets,” “The Rocks,”
and the gentlemanly dignity of Fort Dawes.
Again the N.S.W. dancing championship
stays at home. The Sydney competitors
snatched victory from the Melbourne pair by
961 votes to the Southerners’ 362. Mr.
Halliday and Miss Watson are this State’s
champions, while the Victorian hopes are Mr.
Hall and Miss Shade. Dulcie Culnane and
Jack Monder, who were Australia’s jazz
champions last year, have decided to become
partners for life, and have duly notified their
engagement.

At Moonee Valley on Saturday the wind
was scorching, and feminine interest in the
proceedings slack. The fixture, staged by
the V.8.C., was in aid of the club's benevo-
lent fund for trainers and jockeys and their
dependants. The meeting was largely at-
tended, though society found the counter-
attraction of tennis more to its humor. The
dressing was not illuminating; sleeveless:
apparel was much in evidence, and millinery
was mainly of the floppy crinoline order.
The most wonderful garment seen was a
coat of white satin fur-edged, a flight
of swallows embossed thereon in gold.
Though the heat was fierce on Saturday,
the finals of the inter-State tennis matches
drew heaps of patronage. Crowded stands
were a mass of color in parasols, vivid
hats and gay frocks. The younger set had
its day out; Mrs. R. R. Harper, Vic-
toria's champion, had to cave in to the tem-
perature, and forfeit her title to Esna Boyd.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers, in apricot-hued crepe-de-
Chine and strings of pearls with water-lilies
on her white Pandan hat, was among the
onlookers. Everyone wore pearl's or near
ones, large or small.
The dance of the Lawn Tennis Association
at the Kooyong Club House on Saturday
night was a charming party whose success
was helped by a cool change. Trippers flitted
through arches of rambler-roses from ball-
room to piazza, and wandered around the
grounds between the one-steps. Wicker-
baskets of varied blossoms were arranged
amid the tempting dainties of supper. Vera
de Bavay and Miss Bedge. did the decorations.
The dressing was particularly alluring; the
dancers were chiefly of the unattached, few
married folk being present. President Nor-
man Brookes and Mrs. Brookes were there,
of course, she having some wonderful pearl
and diamente embroidery upon cosmos-hued
georgette. Victoria's new tennis champion,
Esna Boyd, had Pervanche-bluc georgette
and pale-gold lace flounces; Mrs. R. R.
Harper appeared also, in blue of deeper
hue with lace attachments; Adelaide’s player,
M iss Lawrence, glistened in white and crys-
tal embroidery; Miss Cox, from Sydney,
had fiotvers scattered at intervals on her
black lace gown. An overseas visitor was
Mr. Ayres, whose name is associated with
tennis-balls.
Mrs. R. MacKinnon, passing to her home
in Sydney from, the Geneva Conference, gave
a record of her stewardship to audiences in
Perth and Adelaide; then, arriving here, was
duly entertained by the N.C.W. and the
A.W.N. Club. On Thursday afternoon the
local Housewives’ Association, headed by
Mrs. Glencross and president Mrs. Thomas,
had the lady to tea at the Austral Salon, and
handed her the usual floral token of the
honored guest. The returned delegate sported
upon her black gown the national corn-
flowers of the late enemy, a signal no doubt
that now all’s well with the world; and her
smart black silk toque covered a coiffure
newly shingled. The visitor’s remarks veered
from the technical side of the League of
Nations to sidelights thrown on social gather-
ings. on fashions, and on folk she had met.
A pleasant preliminary to the afternoon was
I.he presentation of a Christmas-gift bag to
Mrs. Glencross from the members of the
Housewives’ Association. Ada Bromham,
from Westralia, hon. sec. of the Australian
Federated Women’s Societies, was given
greeting also. She is to bo a delegate to the
Paris Conference of the International Suff-
rage Alliance next year, and is here to dis-
cuss things with fellow representatives. The
lady once aspired to Parliamentary honors,
but was defeated.
Governor Stradbroke’s good deed on the
first day of the month was the opening of a
new wing and casualty ward of the Homoeo-
pathic Hospital. Homoeopathic treatment
began here in 1869 in a dispensary which de-
veloped seven years later into a hospital in
Spring-street. Further expansion caused a
foundation-stone of the handsome building on
St. Kilda-road to be laid by the late Mar-
quis of Normanby in 1882. And the activi-
ties ■of the institution still increase: in-
patients last year numbered 1170, and out-
patients 10,829. The two wards for children
are uncommonly cheery; conspicuous on the
walls is a dado in color, illustrating nursery
rhymes and games, painted by a team of our
best women artists. The hospital has rare
support in its Ladies’ Aid Association, with
Mrs. Carnegie as president and Mrs Poult-
ney Mein as hon. secretary. Last week's
ceremony drew many friends of the hospital,
who found tea and etceteras awaiting them
in a big marquee. Incidentally, the nurses
celebrated the occupation of their new quar-
ters by having a dance the same evening in
the big tent.
Holiday trips are the general topic these
days; and if the eyes are not fixed far afield
it’s to “the hills,” as Melbourne likes best to
call its mountains. Already the Chalet at
Buffalo _ sends a cry that with 250 guests
booked it can't take more for Christmas. The
Railways Department does things well up
there; and it remembers its “Safety First”
motto even to the extent of having a fire
brigade on the premises. The surrounding
Australian Alps will be lit with fireworks
on Christmas eve as a special turn for visi-
tors.
When Phyllis Margaret, eldest daughter
of the Lee Neils, of East Kew, became Mrs.
Leslie Griffiths last week, she wore, attached
to her gown of parchment-toned satin, the
train of silver lace she had trailed when she
curtsied at a Royal drawing-room. An em-
broidered tulle veil and an armful of lilies
made harmony. Eileen and Kathleen, who
attended their sister, wore flower-like frocks
of blue and mauve respectively, with silver
headpieces. The wedding tea-party was served
at Monnington ; the bride’s mother was in
filmy covering of beige georgette and silk lace,
with golden-hued pansies adorning her brown
millinery. Draperies of black chiffon, with
blue blossoms brightening a black hat, were
chosen by the happy man’s mother. Mrs. John
Griffiths.
Victoria’s golf champion, Captain W. B.
Tunbridge, played in an interesting mixed
doubles last week with Lorna B. de Cres-
pigny. The preliminaries of the match were
unannounced —it was just a family affair.
The bride, who is the second daughter of the
late journalist P. Cli. de Crespigny and of
Mrs. de Crespigny, of Kew, wore millinery
and frock of white, and her sister Francesca
bridesmaided. D. P. Davidson, son of
Admiral A. P. Davidson, caddied for the
bridegroom, who began his war services at
Gallipoli with the Light Horse. Invalided
home, he returned later and wound up with
the Flying Corps—he is now on the R.A.F.C.
reserve.
The wedding of Eira Sturdee, only daugh-
ter of Dr. and Mrs. feturdee, of Elsternwick,
takes place on Thursday. The fortunate
man is Francis Weston, B.Sc., an English-
man who met his fair fate during her visit
to her brother, Colonel Sturdee, in India.
The Admiral who had trouble at the Falk-
land Isles was an uncle of the bride.
The Garran lady, Dr. Douglas Stewart
and his decorative wife, and the Vanderke-
lens were in front seats at pianist Hilda
Roberts’s recital on Thursday night at the
Assembly Hall. The artist of the burnished
shingle, who wrestled with an instrument of
woolly bass and unresponsive tone, put nimble
finger-work, vigor and lots of brilliance into
the B Flat Beethoven Sonata, a long com-
position with many difficulties in its path, and
her Chopin offerings had a soothing, singing
tone.

The Education Department is doing its
best to make its girl students conversant
with the domestic arts as well as the rule of
three and the veneer known as accomplish-
ments. These young people are now provided
with nine schools where they can do seventh-
and eighth-grade work and learn all home
duties, from making shinoleum to copying
a Paris model gown. Last week the Mont-
ague school had a special demonstration,
when pupils showrnd what they could bake
and make, furnishing menus for every-day
meals unto a wedding feast with the usual
three-tiered erection of plum-cake and
almond icing. Maidens who had fashioned
frocks or millinery were their own manne-
quins, and proudly displayed the same.
The Tallis lady has reason to feel rather
proud of her brain-wave for, raising funds
for St. Vincent’s appeal. Her Opportunity
Shop, with its conglomeration of wares old
and new, useful and ornamental —and neither
—has returned so far somewhere over £3OO
a week clear. Never has the old Cyelorama
sinee its brief days of early glory shown
such a profit. The result proves that things
we don’t want others may. People who have
not contributed are asked to take stock of
tlieii - possessions, and send along what they
can well do without in order to keep up
supplies.
Mrs. Henrietta Walker, who for some
time has been showing us to what good and
artistic uses the bark of mountain-ash and
other native trees could be put, had last
week a capital display of Christmas gifts
fashioned from the humblest spoils of the
forest. Beautiful shades of red, green, pur-
ple and browns in the plaited fibre sound'd
a glad hallelujah that German dyes are not
needed when our own bush holds such colors.
A collection of trays, baskets, mats, picnic
comforts and window boxes —these last most
fascinating—found ready purchasers. Mrs.
\\ alker’s industry gives many a disabled
person a means of living, and the plaiting
of the materials is beautifully done by the
blind —it is an Aussie enterprise in every
detail, and the employer is mighty proud of
her workers.

A line from London :
The Amadio-Austral divorce proceedings have not
fluttered an eyelash in the English concert world, and
both have been appearing with their accustomed
frequency. Other times, other manners! A genera-
tion ago, when Melba’s name was mentioned in a
divorce suit which was abandoned, the Diva’s law-
yers communicated with the Australian press and
begged suspension of judgment as a matter of fair-
play to the impugned singer. This week Miss
Austral has sung at the Royal Choral Society’s
Albert Hall performance of “Elijah,” and also at
the final promenade concert in the Queen’s Hall.
On both occasions she added to her artistic reputa-
tion, the beauty of her voice and the manner of its
use drawing warm eulogy from the Times. Other
critics were no less enthusiastic.
Tlie beautiful garden at the Frankston
home of H. M. Collins afforded welcome and
shade to the many guests who were bidden
there on a recent afternoon. Glad hands
were extended by the host and his daughter
Mrs. Dudley Trenchard, whose picture mil-
linery was worn with ivory crepe much
beaded, and by Mrs. Edmund Collins. in a
black frock brightened with touches of blue,
and crimson roses upon her black hat. Ices
and strawberries and tea were housed in a
marquee, and a string orchestra added fur-
ther cheer. Workers for the Alfred Hospital
were chief among the invited, and though the
heat was fierce the party was pronounced
delightful.
Margaret Preston’s colored woodcuts ap-
peal to art patrons’ present taste, and the
demand for the vivid-colored prints in-
creased daily as the show 7 in which she and
Thea Proctor starred drew to a close. To
the surprise of many—perhaps even the
artist—Thea’s water-colors found more buy-
ers than her fan designs.
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, in a modish frock of
bois-de-rose georgette that liad mole about the
wrist and was worn with picture millinery,
gave a unique entertainment at Kifinoull to
some of Melbourne’s smartest, bidden to meet
Mrs. William Black and her two daughters,
travellers from Scotland. It was an Omar
Khayyam party. Into the sunlit garden wan-
dered Omar and the Beloved (Jean Camp-
bell), dancing girls and a slave softly strik-
ing a tom-tom. Guests feeling, quite un-
repentant listened to the wisdom of the
Persian dramatically expounded by Bea-
trice Ternan. The scene was realistically
set beneath a big oak-tree on the lawn, the
performers draped, trousered, turbaned and
scarfed in beautiful tissues, silks and velvets,
gold, silver, green, magenta, petunia and del-
phinium-hued, amid harmonising cushions
and brocaded draperies. Tea was served in
th 3 dining and billiard rooms, under mystic
blue and cyclamen-shaded lights. When the
cups were empty came the host in tartan
and kilt —a gentle reminder of St. Andrew’s
Day. Among the cushioned audience on the
grass were Mrs. Black, in a gown of black
Chantilly lace, with quills of lilac-colored
ribbon upon a black hat; tire Best dame and
daughter Margot, wearing blue chiffon scat-
tered with mole roses: Mrs. Grossardi, a
study in beige lace; and Mrs. Gilbert Lodge,
whose biscuit-colored georgette was much
spoke-stitched,
The annual meeting of the committee of
the Ladies’ Work Association was held at the
headquarters in the Block on Friday morn-
ing, Mrs. S. M. Bruce presiding. This
association, besides enabling the workers to
find a market for their splendid efforts, in-
troduces to the public the most beautiful
stitchery done in Melbourne. Some exquisite
French embroidery displayed at the Associa-
tion room is the finest of such work seen
and fashioned here.
The Association gained a brilliant success
last year in making several battalion banners
and King’s colors, upon which the military
authorities bestowed lavish praise, especially

a nd silk cords hand-made. The L.W.A. offers
a way out for Christmas gift-seekers.

Sister Adelaide in a summer trock
Amateur racing at Cheltenham, polo at Birkalla
and the Children’s Hospital fete have been our chief
diversions, and most of them would have progressed
to an accompaniment of apoplexy and sunstroke but
for our merciful afternoon breeze. Lady Bridges
gave the hospital fete its benediction (her first public
appearance since she came back), and the commit-
tee’s new president Glover bade her welcome. At
Birkalla the Barritts dispensed tea (he is the
Adelaide Club’s new captain), and Mrs. Edmund
Bowman presented the trophies. At Cheltenham the
heat brought such a blossoming into gay-hued frocks
as we’ve not seen for ages. A younger matron in
vivid floral geol . ge tte topped by a cool white hat
and an older one in black and white were two of the
smartest figures on the lawns,

figures. The Government is to take steps to protect
them from autograph-fiends and “souvenir” collectors.
Mrs. MacKinnon, of Sydney, tea-ed by the Mayoress

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Gloaming’s Sister is earning her oats.
The daughter of The Welkin —Light had another suc-
cess on Saturday, this time in the £lOOO Kirkham
Stakes at Warwick Farm. Toohey rode the filly, and
got her home by a neck from the Greenstead colt
Greenhorn, who led into the straight; Troisieme,
the second favorite (Rosolini was favorite at 2’s), was
third, with Waitaki and lvanooka close up. Winner
and runner-up were at 12’s and 20’s respectively.
Followers of Toohey collected again after the Mode-
rate Stakes, in which the jockey gave an artistic
exhibition on Gadamin (B’s), a Gadabout gelding who
is inclined to loaf. Lilah (6 to 4) beat a big field
in the Camden Handicap, unlucky King Cyllene,
Valais Queen and Janitor being nearest to her at the
close. The Blankney II. —Trenody mare traversed the
six furlongs in lmin. 13Jsec. —a smart trial for the
Carrington Stakes, in which she has the nice weight
of 7st. 6lb. Master Cagou (10’s), who has 7st. 121 b.
in the Summer Cup and Bst. in Tattersall’s Club
Cup, ran a respectable mile in the Moorebanlc Handi-
cap, cutting down Bowalla, Egyptian Flower and The
Wraith in fine style; and Moisha (4’s) was always
too good for the moderates opposed to him in the
Warwick Farm Handicap. This likely-looking four-
year-old, who is by Bowman—Staylace, has been fail-
ing in mile races, but he showed at the Farm that
a distance is more to his liking—going easily all
the time, he galloped the 11 furlongs in 2min. 21sec.
He has 6st. 71b. in the Summer Cup and the same
in Tatt.’s Cup.
AFTER MAROUBRA.
PASSENGER: “Where’ll we be for lunch?”
SPEED HOG: “All depends what sort of life
you have led.”
“Tuart” : A Bulletin contributor wrote
recently (B. 15/10/’25) that Pigeon Pie was a pretty
good horse and was likely to win.a decent handicap.
I don’t question either statement or prophecy, but
in the art of “placing” horses the people who control
Pigeon Pie’s destinies have a lot to learn. After
his promising displays in the spring they withdrew
the animal from race after race, although in every
instance, he was mildly treated in moderate company.
They didn’t give him a run until December 2, when
they started him in a six-furlong affair at Warwick
Farm. The field was select —-it included Hemisphere,
Pteropod, Absurdum, Janitor and other smart ones—
and there was no money in sight for Pigeon Pie, but
he won, running away, from Hemisphere and Janitor
in lmin. and could apparently have taken
the lead at any stage of the journey. As a result,
he at once became favorite for the Villiers Stakes,
and even if he misses the Villiers he is going to be a
short-priced horse throughout the Christmas and
New Year meetings. More judiciously “placed,” he
could have landed a couple of races without being
half the boom he now is, thanks to the Warwick
Farm surprise. Apropos . Pigeon Pie is bred on much
the same lines as Windbag, being by Magpie (imp.)
out of a Charlemagne 11. (imp.) mare.
The most discussed nag in Melbourne these
days is Noggin, an aged chestnut gelding by Sea
Prince—Wee Dram, owned by J. A. MacLeod, and
trained by the South Australian, J. Sing. Regarded
until recently as a mere hurdler, he was taken to
Ballarat last week for the Cup, and just failed to
catch Spearer (Spearhead—Francelli’s Daughter) by
a head. He went one better in the Fund Handicap
at the V.R.C.’s Benevolent Fund meeting at Moonee
Valley, showing his heels to Demades, Pluto and
four others and galloping the 10 furlongs in the
course-record time of 2min. 4 3 sec. The ancient, who
was ridden by O’Sullivan, was favorite at 2’s. He
may go on and win the Australian Cup, as did
Marmont and Realm, who were also hurdlers in their
day. The Flemington trainer Leyshon, who makes
few mistakes, scored a double at the Valley with
Amanteel (10’s) in the Welter Plate and Penlocin
(3’s) in the Highweight Handicap.
W * * *
“Petrie”: There are honest punters—in
Queensland, at all events. At the Queensland Cup
meeting a young fellow who had just collected on
the tote fought his way back through the queue
and said to the clerk, “You made a mistake.’’
“What are you talking about?” demanded the clerk,
belligerently. “You paid me 10 bob too much,”
said the young chap, thrusting a note into his hand.
At Albion Park a lucky punter was overpaid £lO at
the tote. He took it back as soon as he discovered
the mistake. Tote attendants say that such inci-
dents are fairly common.
“Hasen” : Queensland stewards sometimes
move in a mysterious way their blunders to
perform. At a recent meeting the Kedron
club’s officials held solemn inquiry into the running
of a horse that had drifted unmercifully in the
betting and finished unplaced. The report of the
proceedings in the next day’s Daily Mail is dis-
tinctly intriguing:—
“Blank (the rider) said his first instructions from
Mr. (the owner) were to go; then Mr.
changed his mind and told him not to go. Before
he left the enclosure Mr. told him not to win.
..... He did not have any money with him, but sent
a message to a man who backs his horses for him
to back the mare.... After deliberating, the stewards
said that while they viewed the matter with very
grave suspicion they had decided to give them the
benefit of the doubt.”
If anyone knows of a more caustic commentary on
the noble sport of pony-racing and its methods, or
of a more Gilbcrtian verdict than this “benefit-of-
the-doubt” one, I should like to hear about them.
Mosman (holders for four years) and
Leichhardt had a great race for the N.S.W. eight-
oar championship on the Parramatta River. After
half a mile North Shore and Drummoyne were out
of it, and the other two crews fought desperately for
the lead. There was never more than a length be-
tween them over the gruelling Ryde-Searle’s Monu-
ment course (3m. 167yds.), and Leichhardt was
all out in winning by half a length in 19min.
33 3-ssec. Leichhardt was stroked by J. Lewis and
coached by E. E. Keary, and there were no prouder
men in Sydney that night. Milton Kent, who used
to race as a professional, never gave the others a
hope in the sculling event, and won by four lengths
(it looked six at least) in 22min. 39 3-ssec. But
J. A. Goulding (second) will represent N.S.W. in
the next inter-State race.

An outstanding effort at the Dunn Shield
athletic contests in Sydney was 0. Ebert’s high-
jump record of 6ft. 0-gi'n. He had won the title with
a leap of sft. 11 Jin., and at the third attempt
established the new figures, which are the State’s
best. Ebert is only 18. In the 100yds., N. R.
Burns (Uni.) finished well clear of Tom McNamara
and Jimmy Carlton in 10 3-10 sec,., and could appar-
ently have made it even time had life been pushed.
McNamara took the 440yds. in 51 3-ssec., C. S.
Stuart the mile in 4min. 38 l-ssec., and N. Cun-
ningham the broad jump, 22ft. Bsin. E. H. Scott
(120yds. hurdles in 16sec.) and policeman George
Parker (3-mile walk in 22min. 50 3-ssec.) retained
titles they won last year.

“Hamer”: Although fleetness of foot is a
gift of springy youth, a 100yds. race at the Vic-
torian Highland Society’s sports saw a man who is
anything but a chicken toeing the 19yds. mark. He
was Alf Heppner, who is old enough to have won the
Stawell Gift in 1892. Even with his big start he
failed to get a place; but the old performer
reckons it a good training gallop for the Stawell,
in which he intends running next year.

Blue skies, a big crowd, a rich atmospheric
mixture of combusted petrol and burnt oil. and
speed in wholesale quantities were the ingredients
of the day’s enjoyment at Maroubra (N.S.W.) when
the new speedway was officially opened. The highest
speed attained was about 96 miles per hour, main-
tained for a lap by Stratton, riding a 7.9-h.p.
Indian motor-cycle in the final of the five-miles
scratch race for machines of over 350 cc. No car
moved at faster than 90m.p.h. dßut such speeds
are tremendously thrilling and impressive, especially
on first acquaintance, and the crowd at Maroubra
undoubtedly got what it paid for. There were no
accidents, and the track should be capable of
holding both cars and cycles at speeds considerably
in excess of those registered on Saturday. At
future meetings it will probably be found advisable,
especially in the case of motor-cycles, to institute
more classes, based on engine-power. At the open-
ing meeting cars were in two classes only—over
and under 3000 cc. (30h.p. by A.C.U rating and
about 25h.p. by R.A.C.), and cycles were graded as
either under or over 350 cc. (2fh.p.). There will
undoubtedly be a large increase in the number of
drivers who can do all that is humanly possible
with the machines at their disposal, so more attention
will have to be paid by handicappers to the capacity
of the machine. If close finishes can be brought
about —there were few on Saturday—something
approaching the cycling boom of 1900 may be
anticipated. But before that happens the simple
old system of cycledom, which allots each indi-
vidual competitor a number and colors which he re-
tains throughout a meeting, will have to be adopted.
* * * *
“Trox”; The Maroubra speedway may not be
the best in the world, but there are few better.
Its relatively small size, five-sixths of a mile, is
an advantage from the spectators’ standpoint, as the
Whole race can be watched. Brooklands, near London,
is 2jj miles round, and so much of the racing is out
of sight of the public that interest has largely
declined. . The most popular old-world track at the
moment is Montlhery, in France; 1J miles round, it is
faster than Brooklands, but not so safe. The fastest
American track is at Culver, 1£ miles round and only
60tt. wide; there speeds of over 130m.p.h. have
been safely attained. Sydney is now promised a
track on the Culver lines, If miles round but 80
to 90 feet wide, at Werrington. Rivalry between
Werrington and Maroubra should be keen, and it
is not impossible, since in both tracks the very
latest experience has been utilised, that some
world’s records may be made in Australia.
* * * *
Mannie Brown (9st. 121 b.), who was given
a date with Paul Demsky at the Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night, is a stumpy, short-armed gentleman
of color. He adopts a crouch that renders him
difficult to hit, and to that alone can be attributed
the fact that it took Demsky seven and a half instead
of one and a half rounds to put him to by-bye.
Inviting the clinch, he invariably fastened Paul’s
left arm in a desperate grip and made ridiculous
efforts to knock the white silly with his own left.
Demsky pumped straight lefts into the soft features,
and, when held as described, whipped uppercuts to
the chin and face with his free right. Mannie was
done brown in. the eighth, when a right that just
chipped the point and a swiftly following double to
face and jaw sent him to the canvas, where he lay,
artistically, twitching his fat legs, till Joe AVallis
counted “nine, out.” The paying public had evidently
gauged the American gemmun’s abilities and chances,
and a whole lot of it stayed away, satisfied to read
about it in the Sunday papers.

“S. Gumm”: Dave Smith, who used to be
middleweight champion of the Commonwealth, is
now a Mosman (N.S.W.) alderman, having beaten a
well-known Sydney lawyer for one of the vacancies
in the Balmoral ward. I fancy he is the first member
of his profession to enter public life in N. S. Wales,
but there is a tradition that Paddy King was a
country mayor in Westralia. And Gully, the English
pug., lived to be Speaker of the House of Commons.

The “international lightweight contest” be-
tween Bert McCarthy and Frankie Monroe, of
America, provided very poor fare for those who
accepted the Melbourne Stadium people’s assurance
that the Yank had written his name on the scroll of
fame with a series of knock-outs. Before the end
of a tedious 20-rounder the audience would have been
glad to see a knock-out, without caring much whose
fist delivered it. There were thankful yawns when
the verdict was given to the local lad.

“Bris”: A boxing-match at the Brisbane
Stadium between two slow-footed heavyweights
dragged drearily, and the crowd chanted that it
wanted to go home. Presently a fed-up person in
the three-bob seats stood up and addressed the
referee, Major Craig: “I’ve ’ad enough,” he said,
“but before I leave, I’d like t’ ask y’ somethin’,
Major. ' Will I get coupons w’en I go out?”

The Vic. tennis championships at the
Albert Ground, Melbourne, provided some fine exhi-
bitions of the game and a few
surprises, notably when Wertheim
bdht Patterson, 6 —4, 3—6, 6—l,
6—4. The steadily improving T.
K. Fitchett eliminated Patterson’s
conqueror in a hard-fought five-
set match, 3 —6, 6—3, I—6,1 —6,
6—l, 9—7.; and played off with
Schlesinger" in scorching heat last
Saturday. Schlesinger showed
superiority in both forehand and
backhand work, and honors went
to the Davis Cup man, 6—3,
9 —7, 6 —l. The greatest surprise
was the defeat of Patterson and
Hawkes, who had been doubles
champions since 1921 —Patterson,
with other partners, has been a
title-holder since 1914—by O’Hara
Wood and Mclnnes. Patterson,
who had not been at his best in
the early stages of the tournament,
played so well that, in spite of
unsteadiness on the part of
Hawkes, the pair won the first
set easily, 6 —2. The second set
was full of thrill, Patterson and
Hawkes winning 16 —14; but
Hawkes could not stand the gaff,
and the three following sets and
the championshin were captured by
Wood and Mclnnes 7—5, 6- —3,
6—4. This win will make the
Americans wonder still more why
Wood was omitted from the la.-t
Davis Cup team. Miss Boyd
and Mrs. Harper were left in the
final of the women’s singles, but,
with sets even, the married lady
was prostrated by the heat and
had to let the match go by de-
fault. She returned for the doubles,
and with her friend the enemy as a partner gained an
easy victory from Mrs. O’Hara Wood and Miss Toyne
in straight sets.
“C.Q.”: Watching the medium-sized but intense
Schlesinger winning the singles banner of Vic. tennis
from the tall but inelastic Fitchett was an object
lesson in the value of height on a tennis court.
Schlesinger got all round and behind his opponent
and showed that few inches are no detriment. That
there is a limit, however, is shown by the general
poor showing of the Japs in the international arena.
I remember seeing in Shanghai the entrance into a
white man’s tournament of one of the first Nipponese
with high-class ability. He astounded onlookers with
his mosquito-like agiiity and the iron strength of his
diminutive wrist; all the same, an Englishman, only
a little taller, finally passed him out. The extra
two or three inches mattered. There is no reason,
however why a team of Celestials shouldn’t some day
win the’ Davis Cup. One of the surprise packets of
the recent Victorian meeting was the victory of
S G Lum (M.C.C.) over R. 0. Cummings (N.S.W.)
in the singles. He came of a race of average inches.
* * * *
The things mostly worth remarking of the
Australia v. The Rest match, which began at Sydney
on Friday, are that The Rest had distinctly the better
of the game on the first two days, and that
the individual performances are going to make it
harder than ever for the selectors to find places in
an All-Australia side for brilliant young men at the
expense of old reliable ones. Macartney, owing to a
breakdown in health, played in no Test against
Gilligan’s men last summer, and Bardsley was dropped,
almost for a has-been, before the series closed; yet
no young players batted with the easy confidence and
stylish effectiveness that these two veterans —Macart-
ney is in his 40th year and Bardsley was 41 on Monday
—showed. The Rest batted first and put up 381 —-
Macartney 84, Kelleway 99 n. 0., V. and A. Richardson
56 and 39 apiece, Grimmett 44. It was a respectable
score but not a notable one on a shirt-front pitch,
with Ilornibrook, the experimental bowling hope of
the other side, utterly ineffective. Three men were
run out, or the bowling might have looked even less
impressive. Gregory seems to have lost some of his
pace, although his delivery is as menacing as ever.
Still, 381 was a great deal better than Australia
could do; how badly they might have done, without
Collins, it is impossible to say. The cautious, im-
perturbable skipper, who opened the innings and was
out seventh, contributed 102 to a total of 226. He
took few chances, although he gave one early;
doubtless he would have continued his methods after
reaching the century if it had been a Sheffield Shield
match. Nobody could stay with him long, and
nobody else got into the 20’s except Gregory, who
slogged up 25 to the lively appreciation of the
crowd. The feature of the innings was unquestionably
Arthur Richardson’s bowling. He took 4 wickets for
49, but his length and accuracy and varied pace
stamped him as likely to be more useful to Australia
on English grounds than the figures show —-perhaps
more useful as a bowler than a batsman. Grimmett
bowled creditably, with 2 for 65, and the ground
fielding was good and clean, Rymill specially dis-
tinguishing himself and V. Richardson being quick
and alert as ever. Bardsley (54) and Rock (35)
gave The Rest a good start in the second innings,
but Hendry rose to the occasion for his side, and
there was still hope for Australia when this page had
to close down.
“Winkle”: To Victorians, the most pleasing feature
of the Trial Test was Woodfull’s elevation to the
Australian side. Unlike most batsmen, whose big
scores are bright spots amid a host of failures, this
patient cricketer’s career has been all success. After
the war he started with a Maryborough (Vic.) XI, and
for three seasons his averages were 94, 195 and 482.
Against the South Oss colts and the N.S.W. seconds
he made 169 n.o. and 227 n.o. in two hits. Going
into Shield games, he straightway headed the aggre-
gates with 514 runs, average 85. Last year for
Victoria he made 494, average 61; with the team in
Maoriland, 891, average 148 ; and in the three Test
matches there, 110, 50, and 150, in each case being
not out. His 44 on a damaged wicket in the recent
match v. South Oss. was a capital performance. Wood-
full would make an ideal Australian representative, as
he can field well anywhere and can get runs on a bad
pitch. Nor is anyone keener for the game, for, like
Ranji, he has a private pitch and practises all the
year round.

“Adelaide” : The most curious thing about
club cricket in Adelaide at the moment is the posi-
tion of East Torrens, which has lost every game
played so far. Yet the club is used to being out
A THOROUGH JOB OF IT.
“Did I break a winder?”
“Yes, be cripes; an’ y’ broke both sides o’ the glass, too.”
in front, ever since the far-off days of the Goodens, the
Giffens, Lyons and Blinman, when it was called
“Norwood.” Then it was very strong under Darling
and Clem Hill. Just before the war, it had a great
team, comprising the Hills, the Chamberlains, Craw-
ford, Whitty, Mayne, Middleton, et al. ; one season,
eight of its men played for S.A. After the war, it
built up another premiership side; in fact, was so
strong that the district was cut in half and a Ken-
sington club formed out of it. All these things
happened to it at about the same time: Arthur
Richardson was taken to be coach to a new Colts’
club; Morton was tempted away to Melbourne;
Rymill and Stirling joined Kensington, and Town-
send moved to Sturt. Also Middleton has retired,
and Murray and Loveridge are not what they were.
Thus S.A. is running its most promising season for
many years without any help from the old-time lead-
ing club.
* * * *
“Tren”: Few athletes pleased larger audi-
ences than did Chris Keirnan, who has just died.
He represented Victoria many times at cricket, base-
ball and football. In his youth, when junior games
drew galleries that pennant cricket has never been
able to attract, Chris won local celebrity as captain
of the La Mascottes of Collingwood Swamp. Going
to Fitzroy, he found that his long association with
matting hampered him on the turf ; nevertheless, he
was a consistent rungetter for ’Roy and Victoria,
a useful bowler and a really great cover point. His
football was of the characteristic Fitzroy brand —
desperate and crafty by turns.

“THE HAVEN”
By
DALE COLLINS,
AUTHOR OF "ORDEAL.”
Price 6/-
“THE HAVEN” is as far removed from the
ordinary Pacific story as “Ordeal” from the rank
and file of sea stories. The theme of “THE HAVEN”
is daring, but Mr. Collins handles it with complete
success. Its central figure, the Handsomest Man in
the World, the idol of millions of women, flees for
brief respite to a tropic island. He is deliberately
pursued by five sensation-craving women of widely
differing types. They are left marooned to work out
their destinies, and the result is an intensely moving
romance. Mr. Collins has contrived to give “THE
HAVEN” unusual significance, making it a com-
mentary on human endeavor, while never neglecting
to tell a tale of realism, strength and beauty. The
style is brilliant, and the book confirms all the
prophecies made on the appearance of “Ordeal.”
“The Haven” is an Extraordinary Book.

THE INKY WAY.
“Cue”: After reading proofs for 30 years, and
newspapers for a much longer period, I nominate
“g'uage” as the word most frequently mis-spelt from
end to end of the Inky Way. Often enough it
defies or eludes all attempts at correction, and forces
its way into the finished newspaper. In second place
I would put “concensus.”
“Ricardo”: The Daily Mail put up a Brisbane
record in reporting the death of Queen Alexandra.
The news came through at 5.39 on Saturday, after
the greater part of the usual issue had been run
off. Two minutes later a “special” containing the
news, with a three-column biography of the Queen
Mother, was on the streets.
Sharpened his last blue-pencil, Janies Dunn, second
son of Andrew Dunn, Queensland’s Northcliffe. The
Reaper’s sickle found him at Rockhampton, where
he was chief of the Morning Bulletin. He had
been to the war, andi got a bullet through each arm.
Dunn, senior, controls a string of papers at Rocky,
Maryborough, Toowoomba and Warwick.
The family of Charles John James, of the West-
ern Champion (C.-W. Q.), should hold the Austra-
lian newspaper record for the number of members
all working together. James’s children and nieces
all work on the paper—one girl is a lino, operator
and compositor, another a slugger and comp., while
the younger ones do routine work. The patriarch of
the tribe has just turned 70.
“Fitz”: R. J. Baker, editor and proprietor of the
Gosford (N.S.W.) Times, has been in Lewisham
Hospital for some time past. Baker cut his journal-
istic teeth on the Molong Argus, which he eventually
bought and conducted for years. Then he went to
Peak Hill, and bought the Express. Later he sold
that, and took on the Gosford Times, which he has
run successfully—he has a happy knack of making
his papers pay. On the Country Press Association
he won his spurs years ago, and has occupied the
highest position in it.
“Sigs”: Two of the bigger figures behind the
Queensland Labor machine are Alex. Robertson, editor,
and Jim Connie, leader-writer, of the official organ,
the Daily Standard. The chief is a tall, dark,
quiet young man who worked up from a small boy’s
duties and took over the chair - when ex-Senator J.
V. McDonald vacated it. Gomrie is of the big,
cheery type so prominent in the North, and is well
grounded in the theory of Labor’s mission. Between
them • they discipline the constantly-warring fac-
tions, whip up the stalwarts, and on a limited capital
and with a small but live staff turn out a bright
newspaper.
John Watson, of the Border Watch, Mount Gam-
bier (S.A.), has just celebrated his 91. Born at
Forres. Scotland, he went into the local Gazette
office at 14, and has been using printer’s ink nearly
ever since. He landed in Australia at 22, and
found a job in the Argus office. Afterwards he was
a tutor and a public-school teacher, but in 1863 —
62 years ago —he joined the Border Watch, and
that was his last shift. A close friend of Adam
Lindsay Gordon, many of the latter’s poems were
published in Mr. Watson’s paper. Once he con-
tested a by-election in the South-East (S.A.), but
was defeated by one vote; and he never tried to
recover it. He is the State’s oldest J.P. —his com-
mission was issued on January 3, 1873.
“Encre de Chine”: “Fed Up” (B. 22/10/’25) and
“Wart” (B. 12/11/’25) have put the case for the
freelance writer. The freelance artist, too, has a
genuine grievance against editors who accept work
and then postpone using it sine die. In disgust I
have removed work which has been accepted (not
merely held for consideration) from two well-known
periodicals after weary months of waiting. The
editor of one of them encouraged me, by the enthusi-
astic reception which he accorded my work, to
do a series. Three drawings of the series appeared in
fairly satisfactory sequence. The blocks were made for
three more, and I had colored the blue-prints (each
marked “urgent”). They failed to appear. I waited,
and then inquired. My series was no longer needed.
I removed the drawings, though I was invited to
give them a further period of “cold storage” on the
slender chance that “we might possibly use them at
some future time.” It seems to me that work definitely
accepted should be paid for after a reasonable time,
whether it is used or not.
“Oxmead”: iRe the literary Trollopes (B.
19/11/’25). Anthony’s eldest brother was Thomas, a
well-known figure in London Clubland 40 years ago—-
well known partly owing to certain eccentricities of
dress; his pants, according to one contemporary
writer, “flapped around his ankles like a loosened
mainsail.” His books, as far as memory serves, dealt
largely, if not mainly, with Italy ; he was more
scholarly than his more famous brother. He finished
up with some interesting family biography, too.
One of his stories com erning brother Anthony, given
on Anthony’s authority, dealt with the latter’s
heroic remedy for cutaneous injuries sustained by
being too long in the saddle. During one of his
dashes about the world—it may have been during
his visit to Australia —after two or three days on
horseback the creator of Mrs. Proudie dismounted
at a pub something in the condition of a schoolboy
after a severe birching (old style). He limped
into the bar, ordered two bottles of brandy from
an amazed Bung, took them upstairs to his bed-
room, poured the contents into a basin and seated
himself therein for ten minutes. The cure, it was
said, was entirely effective.
MIXING IT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The N.S.W. Chief Secretary (Mr. Lazzarini) said
‘that if Labor in politics' was again to come into
its own the wreckers who had attempted to foul its
nest by foreign revolutionary doctrines must be put
beyond the pale. In the recent elections the dice
were loaded against Labor.’ ”
The wrecker grinned as he ate his cake
And schemed how to have it, too.
“To grasp the nettle I go,” he spake,
“And eke the bull by the horns to take,
To toe the line and to scotch the snake,
And paddle my own canoe.”
But he whistled before he was out of the wood
(He should have gone while the going was good).
In a single basket his eggs he packed
Ere the dogs of war were loosed,
And he counted his chicks as his lips he smacked —
Before they were hatched, as a matter of fact—
But the grapes were sour, and the cards were stacked,
So they never came home to roost.
They were nipped, as a man might say, in the bud.
(Don’t tell me ’tisn’t as clear as mud).
In the silken glove was an iron hand
That drew the sword from its sheath,
But it turned to a ploughshare, I understand—
A broken reed and a rope of sand —
Which is why he only heat the band,
As it were, by the skin of his teeth.
But he crossed the Rubicon, anyhow
(We ought to be getting somewhere now).
Beware the wolf in a coat of wool,
The ass in a lion’s skin !
And never forget that a long, strong pul]
Will cook the goose of the Irish bull
Who threatens the shop of china full;
But you needn’t do him in.
Just hoist the cow with his own petard
(These images tend to exhaust a bard).
He was caught red-handed, some allege.
No question what he was at.
Does an honest man look over the hedge
And play with fire or with tools on edge ?
And, listen to me, he waved a wedge,
Thin end in front, at that!
And the nest was fouled when the beans were spilled
(Such a nest, mayhap, as the grey mares build).

Large numbers of Republic trucks are
operating satisfactorily to-day after ten
years of faithful service. To present
day truck buyers this means simply
that Republic trucks are built to haul
tonnage throughout truck life at the
lowest cost per ton per mile hauled.
Length of life, of course, is merely a
factor in the whole equation—just as
are mileage, and upkeep, and cost, and
operation. You must consider all fac-
tors to decide intelligently what to buy.
However, it is impressive evidence of
Republic’s lowest ton mile cost, that
Republic trucks have performed 10
years—and still are performing satis-
factorily. Trucks that are so built must
have a very long start in the direction
of lowest ton mile cost.
And Republics continue just as they
start. Built by the organisation that
has produced and sold more trucks than
any other exclusive truck company, it
is but natural that Republic trucks
should reflect this experience, this
knowledge and this solidity in econ-
omical hauling.
We want to sell you Republic trucks
only on the basis that, all factors con-
sidered, we can save you money on
your hauling.
Republic is one of the few nationally ser-
viced, nationally used, nationally reputed
trucks. Only a truck proved at every
task, in every region, gives assurance of
fitness for all work.

Last week the intrepid Arundel Orchard
led his Sydney Conservatorium forces in that
overpowering work of Gustav Holst, “The
Planets.” In its entirety this work has been
done only about nine times in England, the
chief trouble being the choir in the last
movement; consequently the Sydney per-
formance which went through the seven
pieces for large, orchestra from start to finish
was quite an event. Mr. Orchard’s prelimin-
ary lecture had raised, if possible, musical
interest in the event, and a Conservatorium
packed to suffocation listened to the first
Australian performance. As staggering as
an effort to take in a whole picture-gallery at
one visit was the effect of trying to retain
the tone-color woven by the composer around
the different planets; but the work does
emphasise Holst’s outstanding skill in orches-
tration, and his ability to immediately enfold
the listener with the mood he is expressing.
So, blood red, the first planet Mars rushed
into being; and played as it was
with extraordinary power and vision, it
at once gripped the hearers. The five-four
rhythm which goes on unceasingly affects the
listener’s nerves in a curious way—inexor-
able, relentless. One thought of Maoris beat-
ing out a haka—insistent, maddening! It is
certainly the best musical picture of a battle
that has been done. Then suddenly Venus, a
woman with quiet eyes, walked in beauty
through a green land. Like a cool wind
stirred the harp and the horns. In this
movement there are lovely solo passages for
fiddle accompanied by syncopated chords on
wood-wind. In Mercury, though there is a
. lot of clever writing, the result is not so
musically successful. Jupiter is the most
popular because of the bustling, colorful folk-
song in the middle. How philosophical, wise
and tender is the old age Saturn brings in
his train; and here,the flutes reach a shining
beauty. But the most poetic of the pieces
is Neptune. Mystic, hypnotic and altogether
“other-side-of-the-moon,” it permeates the
senses till dreams take on the semblance of
reality, and reality seems nothing but a
dream. Not a small part of the effect of
the difficult ending was due to the singing
of the unseen choir.

A commonplace rendering of an uncommon
work was given when the Repertory Society
produced “Anna Christie” on Saturday
night at the Sydney Palace. The savage
poetry which is the keynote of O’Neill’s
writing escaped most of the performers, so
“C HARLEY’S AUNT,” AT SYDNEY
GRAND OPERA HOUSE.
that the inner striving to spirituality which
the playwright indicates in two of the four
principal characters, if it at all reached the
audience did so in spite of, rather than be-
cause of, the actors in the drama. To begin
with, O’Neill’s characters, because of the
poverty of their vocabulary, demand a rich-
ness of tonal quality on the part of their
interpreters. Over and over again in the
play the same characters use the same words
and similes, and only voices tuned to the
finest shadings could color the monotony.
The acting and grouping of the cast were not
without merit had the play been straight
drama instead of a study in psychology; as
it was, lan Maclean’s Mat Burke antago-
nised rather than melted the fancy. One did
not sense the childlike simplicity under the
braggart bully; one felt that in a few years
Mat might quite easily be blacking the eyes
of his Anna. In the name part Daphne
Deane, with her gold hair and blue eyes, sug-
gested a daughter of the North Seas, and
sustained a long performance with credit.
But the outstanding figure was Scott Alex-
ander, who as Anna’s father has the agony
of hearing his supposedly innocent young
daughter reveal herself a prostitute, knowing
that it was his continued neglect that had
turned her, though in years still a girl, into
a woman of bitter thoughts and black words.
Erna Living’s Marthy Owen was a clever
piece of work, and Alfred Maxwell’s bar-
tender suggested in spasms Olympian heights
of cynicism.

Sydney Tivoli audiences are testifying to
the drawing powers of Ella Shields; she
scores best this week in a rollicking sea-
ballad. Corinne Arbuckle, straight off the grid
of American super-vaudeville, and with
shoulders allegedly insured for a fabulous
sum, has been taken to Sydney’s broad bosom
with an unmistakable gesture of fond
motherhood. Rupert Hazell’s mimicry is
attracting attention from the official devil-
chasers themselves, who are looking in to
witness how their pulpit manners appear to
the eyes of other people. The Flemings are
a pair of burly Samsons ; and Bruce Green
continues to fiddle with a knitting-needle and
toy with unmentionable garments to the
accompaniment of songs which this paper
didn’t hear when it was at Windsor Castle in
Queen Victoria's day.

Fuller’s audiences in Sydney are lament-
ing the imminent departure of the ingenious
Gayle Wyer, who, with his amusing com-
pany, has held the fort for over three months.
A great deal of the success of their revues
has been due to the clowning of Walter Cor-
nock and the breeziness of Vera Benson
and Elsa Scott. Wyer’s crowd fills the
second half this week by repeating one of
the early favorites. The sprint before the
interval is given over almost wholly to
musicians of a varied type—intruding Swiff
and Daley, who play tunes on motor-horns,
and the Harris family, which includes a
female harpist of more than fair ability.
And there is Blondi Robinson, who supplies
a laughable burlesque on stage magicians.

Lately films dealing with the French
Revolution have trodden on one another's
heels, and with every new one the historical
significance has become more submerged be-
neath the lavish settings. Now comes
“Scaramouche,” built on a Rafael Sabatini
novel, and, in accordance with custom,
representing a greater expenditure of money
than its predecessors of the same class.
Still, as ordinary people attend a picture
show for entertainment and not to digest
history, it can be regarded as a first-rate
film. Packed tight with action, every sub-
title is a preliminary to an exciting incident,
and Ramon Navarro, who plays the name-
part, is a tireless gallant whose keen-edged
sword works overtime. There are also close-
ups of Marat, Robespierre and Danton, and
enough bloodthirsty revolutionists in the
cast to complete the City Railway and North
Shore Bridge in a week. The Sydney Prince
Edward, where the screening takes place,
has arranged a suitable prologue, which in-
cludes orchestral numbers. Hoyt’s have

At the Melbourne King’s, which has a
habit of changing its mind, the Nellie Bram-
ley co. decided to revive “Fair and Warmer”
for the Melbourne good-bye, instead of tempt-
ing fortune with “The Third Degree.” It
was perhaps as well, for the domesticated
youpg wife who makes an excursion into the
habits of the gay is the best thing Nellie
Bramley has done to date, and the other
members of the co. are well suited. That
remark applies with special force to Arthur
Cornell as Billy Bartlett, the quiet banker
who earns a morning headache, and Beryl
Barraclough, the bright maid who knows
how to mix the cocktail which will cure it.
The company which interrupted a very suc-
cessful season in Sydney to go there was
treated considerably less well in Melbourne
than it deserved. At the end of the Mel-
bourne season it moves to Adelaide, where
“Charley’s Aunt” will help it to woo fortune.

Considerable brightness faded from the
Melbourne Tivoli with the departure of Her-
schel Henlere on Saturday night, and there
is nothing that fully compensates for the
loss. Katrina and Joan, however, provide
some dancing which is charming and at
times sparkling; and Jennie Benson is an
entertaining comedienne who fails to tire
after being seen several times.

The big event at Melbourne Bijou last
Saturday was the arrival of Maude Courtney
and Mr. C. Heaven knows for how many
years the couple have been amusing the
crowds on the Fuller circuit; their matter is
so snappy that it causes forgetfulness of the
fact that the lady’s voice isn’t equal to Clara
Butt’s or as good as Dal Monte’s. The
Littlejohns continue to dazzle the eyes; and
the programme keeps a fair standard.

A temperature of 101 did not prevent

A longshore artist: —
The amicable arrangement recently come to between
the owners and seamen does not worry Carlyle
Jackson in his show at the Sedon Galleries, Mel-
bourne. All his ships remain obstinately tied up.
Some of them look seaworthy enough and are
painted in a nice glowing light, but the longshore
viewpoint is apt to get monotonous. Jackson’s
other efforts are lacking in decision, although he
has made poetry out of some gums and bits of river
in Nos. 5 and 19. No. 23, “Valley of the Goulburn,”
is a pleasant harmony in a low key, but the sky
in the Mount Dandenong landscape (No. 16) is
solider than the earth, and no honest port-official
would give the timber boats in No. 14 permission
to go outside the Heads.

Two more Melbourne picture shows: —
As far as this critic remembers, John C. Good-
child’s first art-essays saw the light in some trench
magazine. They were as crude as the architecture
of a shell-shocked dug-out. His latest show, at the
Fine Art Gallery, lifts him into the G.H.Q. of Aus-
tralian etchers. There are few finer passages extant
than the bit of sun and shade in the right-hand
corner of “Dingley Dell, the Home of A. L. Gordon’’
(No. 37); yet as a composition the picture fails.
There is some of Rembrandt’s spirit in the compli-
cated pattern of No. 46, with its interesting group
crossing a picturesque old bridge; and No. 47, “Bush
Light,” achieves a notable effect with great economy
of means. In No. 2, a Conte crayon drawing, the
sunset glow is splendidly felt all over the paper.
A clean, airy, open style pervades the penwork of
this young Adelaide trier.
C. S. Bardwell Clarke, who has a small show of
miniatures and water-colors at Kozminsky’s Gal-
levy, is a peripatetic painter who has pursued Art
in various quarters of the globe. Apparently he
has found the lady a fast runner. None of his
tabloid likenesses are above the average of local
production and some are several parasangs below it.
He has had commissions from Lady Stradbroke,
Byron Moore and Others. Reckless courage in the
realm of color and timidity in drawing distinguish
his paintings of Australian scenes.

Two clever local youngsters, Bobby Help-
man and Mignon Kekwick, do some good
dancing at the Garden Theatre in Adelaide.
Adele Crane, “Billee” Lockwood and
“Fabbie” Benstead are other ornamental
features, the first-named having a fine voice.
Welch and Gee provide most of the humor,
and Ernest Sefton is a clever assistant. In
pictures Valentino is tremendous as woman-
hater and brisk fighter in a South American
setting at the York. At the Pav. is the
always effective police dog Rin-tin-tin, in
frozen “trails” very acceptable this summer
weather. At West’s is a Keable story of
South Africa, duly fumigated for screen use,
and showing some good local scenery. Betty
Compson and Viola Dana score at Wonder-
graph in their respective styles in two very
American dramas. And at the Prince of
Wales Little Willie has come back to die, for
three nights only, in the always reliable
“East Lynne,” done by the Anderson co.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Winston CliurcliUl
was an enthusiastic spectator at the first
production of the “Good Old Days” at the
Gaiety Theatre. Public interest was so
great that the queue began to assemble be-
fore 8 in the morning. The book and the
lyrics by Oscar Asche are weak, but the
staging is worthy of his great reputation.
Most of the critics have been cold about the
play, the Times being positively icy. Lack
of humor is a fault found on all sides ; but
the beautiful music and great stage-pictures
may secure for it the long run which Asche’s
friends wish. The syndicate interested in
the new venture, besides Oscar Asche and
Lily Brayton, (includes Anthony Prinsep,
the husband of Marie Lohr.
The Fairy Queen’s experience:—
A recent reference to pantomime reminds
me of the days when I toured the Maoriland
“smalls” with a panto, co. We’d arrive in a
town after, perhaps, seven hours’ journey, tramp to
the theatre, which would look more like a morgue
than a place of amusement, and wait about whilst
the wardrobe baskets were being unpacked. Then,
gathering up our clothes from the almost indeserib-
“CHARLEY’S AUNT,” AT SYDNEY

pose to the Aunt.
able confusion of stage junk, wnich was walked on
and kicked about by everybody, we’d rush about
looking for a place to sleep. The “place” would
invariably be of the “Jack’s-come-home” order, but
m ney was too scarce to go in for frill. Once, when
our train was due to leave at seven in the morning,
I asked a morose boots to give me a call at six.
He promised faithfully. About midnight, so it
seemed, there was a troubadour beneath my window.
We were in Spain and it was moonlight—beautiful
exceedingly. What was he singing? I listened, and
then woke up very suddenly. “Hey, if y’. wanter
catch that 7 o’clock train y’ll ’ave t’ ’urry, cos it’s
ten to now.” Over my nightie I put a skirt and
then a raincoat, my bare feet I thrust into shoes —-
my hat was close-fitting, so I didn’t wait to put
hairpins in my hair —and with my clock swinging
to a finger, my undies pushed into an already bulg-
ing suit-case and my corsets, with flying cords, under
my arm, I rushed downstairs and out into the road.
On I sped past paralysed cabbies, my nightie blow-
ing open in the breeze and hair escaping in long
streamers from my hat, and with bulging eyes and
threatened heart-trouble I made my dramatic appear-
ance on the crowded station. The company, already
in the train and hanging out of the windows, greeted
the vision with boisterous laughter. One minute
afterwards the express steamed out, and I sank
thankfully into a seat, utterly done. And then it
came to me that I’d left under Mrs. Guppy’s second-
worst bedroom mattress the savings of a lifetime—the
whole 30 bob!

Poverty
Point
“F.W.” (New York) : Ivy Scott was an
infant prodigy in Australia a good many
years ago. I saw her the other evening at a
metropolitan vaudeville house, where, with
an English tenor, Henry Thompson, she was
giving excerpts from “Lohengrin.” After-
wards she told me that she had faced the
footlights in Australia at the age of four,
and her recollections went back to an old-
time Williamson panto, and to an appear-
ance as Puck in George Rignold’s produc-
tion of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” She
is to-day a pleasing soprani, and one, of the
biggest broadcasting stations in America has
discovered that her voice is admirably suited
to the radio. Result, a year’s contract with
WEAF.
“Lond.”: Oscar Asche has a whole batch of
new plays in prospect. One of them is
written round the tragedy of the Crucifixion.
No, Oscar does not propose to take the lead-
ing part in this; but he does in one he is
writing for himself, about the plump Laugh-
ing Philosopher depicted by Franz Hals. He
is as keen as ever on his patent cooker,
which he insists on producing for the admi-
ration of London interviewers.
“Flaming Youth”: Success has come in
large quantities to Dorothy Seacombe. The
little lady who, at the age of 15, played Tilly
in “Tilly of Bloomsbury” in Australia and
was later with Laurence Grossmith, went
away last year to try her luck in London
and was soon in a “shop.” A change in the
cast of “Just Married,” at the Criterion,
enabled her to get her name on the bills of
a real winner. Now she passes into musical
comedy in “Mercenary Mary,” taking the
place of Peggy O’Neill. It is wonderfully
rapid promotion.
From London: —
The Prince of Wales’ first and only (and immedi-
ate) visit to the theatre since his return from his
long tour was to the Hippodrome, where the dainty
June, who is such a favorite with the Prince, has
an attractive part in “Mercenary Mary.” But, in
spite of everything, Peggy O’Neil dominates the
production.
“P.X.”: Hillhouse Taylor, the C. of E.
parson who wrote “Parsifal” for the Firm,
died at Randwick (Sydney) a week or two
ago. J.C.W. thought very highly of him.
The last time I saw Williamson was at the
final dress-rehearsal of the big show in Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) ; Tittell Brune was the
star. “That’s going to make two reputa-
tions,” he said at the end ofl the show. But
Taylor did nothing much afterwards, largely
because of his health. For a good while past
he had been unable to do any church work,
and the wealthy C. of England in N. S.
Wales is not kind to its broken-down and
worn-out ministers, so that his later days
were full of distress. The last bit of writ-
ing he did was a Red Page article for The
Bulletin a couple of months ago—a racy
reminiscence of his and others’ struggles to
supply Australian goods to the Australian
stage.
“C.G.”: “Box-plan at Glen’s” became a
50-year-old tag on December 1. Nicholson
and Ascherberg ran the music warehouse in
Collins-street, Melbourne, half a century ago,
but sold out in 1875 to W. H. Glen for
£19,000.
“Paree”: “Carmen” has been popular for
half a century without its spectacular pos-
sibilities being recognised. The bull-fight so
important in the action of the piece has always
taken place “off.” But the opera has now
been staged in the open air, in the vast Buf-
falo Stadium in Paris, and the opportunity
was taken to import toreadors and matadors
and have a real bull-fight in the last act.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Heifetz, who rarely
appears in England and has never estab-
lished any definite place for himself in the
British world of music, gave a concert in
the Albert Hall the other day which
attracted a very large audience. His pro-
gramme erred, as usual, on the light side,
for which the critics rapped his knuckles,
especially as his performance showed no
interpretative advance. There was all tin-
old magic of technique, but he seemed more
aloof than ever from the spirit of the com-
posers whose message he undertook to de-
liver.
“Wings” (Lond.) : Four or five months
ago there was a great fanfare here over a
promised sequence of Eugene O’Neill’s plays
with which the American dramatist was to
capture the English public. His own
producer crossed the Atlantic and elaborate
preparations were carried out with exquisite
care. Paul Robeson, the negro actor who
deserted law for the stage, came over from
New York to create the name-part in
“Emperor Jones,” and wonderfully did he
acquit himself. But somehow there appeared
to be little liking for the “strong meat” of
O’Neill’s too often too brutally frank stage-
writing, and with the premature departure
of “Emperor Jones” has gone the whole
scheme for an extended O’Neill season.
“R.Q.” : Pat Hanna, who used to decorate
Wellington (M.L.) with his elegant posters,
is returning to the Windy Islands. He and
his troupe of Diggers have been invited to
entertain the visitors to the Dunedin Exhi-
bition. As Maoriland’s Wembley is stated
to be a third the size of its English prede-
cessor and is attracting commensurate atten-
tion, the bright show should do good business.
“Local”: There is no doubt as to John
Kirby having made good in London (B.
Commenting on his work in
the Lyceum revue, the Sunday Times man
wrote:—
The best acting was provided by Mr. John Kirby,
from Australia. His taxi-driver and boxing referee

are two marvels of characterisation, of which the
first is possibly the better. Anything more glorious
than the baffled, inarticulate indignation of the un-
tipped driver with the walrus moustache and porpoise
roll I have not seen for a very long time.
The Referee is equally enthusiastic. “A
striking hit,” it says, “was made by John
Kirby. His comedy was brilliantly funny,
clever and sidesplitting.” Kirby’s acting was
always appreciated by Australian audiences,
but our Great Managements, it would seem,
did not think much of it. It’s a way our
Great Managements have.
“Goldilocks”: John Ralston is to figure
in a revival of “Lilac Time,” with Harriet
Bennett, from California —a dark-haired,
beautiful girl, who looks as if she had Italian
blood in her veins—as feminine lead. Ral-
ston, who has an engaging voice and is a
good actor withal, has been rather buried in
the productions in which he has appeared
since he impersonated Franz Schubert.
“Erua”: When the Maoriland-made pic-
ture “Rewi’s Last Stand” was screened at
Te Awamutu recently, the most interested
spectator was Te Huia Raureti, aged 95, one
of the three survivors of the original de-
fenders of Orakau pa. The ancient was
seven years old when the Treaty of Waitangi
was signed, and in later years was one of

great Itewn He didn’t mention whether he
thought the film like the real thing.
“Caesar's Ghost” : Arthur Stigant was sing-
ing “ ’Ow I ’Ate Wirnmin” when a contemptu-
ous gallery lady demanded “Wot About Men?”
On the other side of the picture is an old
Billanderson incident. The play was dis-
turbed by a row in the gallery and the screams
of a woman who was being punched unmer-
cifully by a hefty man. As he was dragged
off he explained himself. “The dirty cow
was sneering at the herowliine I” he said.
“W.M.T.”: Tell “Minim” (B. 19/11/’25)
that “Jack’s the Boy,” sung by veteran
Hayden Coffin lately at London Coliseum,
was never a “Country Girl” number.
“Minim” must have been thinking of another
ditty warbfed by Coffin in the character of
Geoffrey Challoner, “A Sailor’s Life Is the
Life, I Trow.” Apropos, why doesn’t the
Firm give us revivals of “A Country Girl.”
“Veronique” and other old favorites? We
are surfeited with jazz and the American
joke.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The inventing of dummy
names for actors like Stanley Hope and
Frank Rossmore, who frequently double
parts, has its pitfalls. In Rossmore’s case
the practice once led to his being given a
funeral. An unsuspecting critic, noticing
the absence of the name, previously included,
from the cast of a show in Adelaide, put a
question to a manager, who (not wishing to
admit the dummying) replied guilefully.
Thereupon the critic announced to his
readers that they would learn with regret of
the sudden demise of the veteran actor Frank
Rossmore, whose name had been associated
with a wide diversity of parts on the bills
of probably every theatre in Australia. He
added sobfully that disappointment at being
excluded from a cast had precipitated the
old chap’s end. Promptly came a denial
from a correspondent, who explained that
he had only just returned from Melbourne,
“where, when I left, Frank Rossmore was
still appearing. In fact, he was appearing
at two theatres each evening.”
“Hamfat”: The old “family circle” has
vanished from Australian theatres, yet it
used to be a highly popular and remunerative
part of the house. It was extensively pat-
ronised by family and other parties who, in
those days, were specially catered for. Some-
times they had a gallery to themselves; more
frequently the party hired a few rows of
seats in the upper gallery wdth the “gods”
at the back of them. Now and then a fight
would disturb the progress of a play owing
to a valorous spouse trying to avenge a
woman who, “talking back" to sportive
“gods,’’ had drawn a barrage of peanuts and
fruit skins. With the disappearance of the
family circle one of the galleries has gone
from many of the houses. Bert Bailey has a
unique experience in regard to the Melbourne
Royal. He played there the last time it had
three tiers of galleries above the main floor,
and again when it re-opened as a two-tier
house.
“John’s Wood” (Bond.) : There has been
some comment on the modesty of Sir Harry
Lauder’s return to London, his unobtrusive
entry being in great contrast to the old
manner of the kilts, the bagpipes, the crooked
stick and army of photographers. Evidently
Sir Harry has no immediate plans for a
London appearance, or he would not have
dropped the “Three Cheers for Scotland”
entry which used to be such a joy to his
enemies. William Morris, who one time
arranged tours for him, once tried to persuade
C. B. Cochran to dress in kilts in order to
enhance the picture of Lauder’s welcome at
the Waterloo station. The Scottish com-
edian’s last home-coming was graced by a
press reception, at which he spoke emotion-
ally of prison reform, and urged the pen-
men to “get right with God.”
“L.H.P.”: I agree with “Ibsenshaw” (B.
19/11/’25) that “The Only Way” is the
best dramatisation of Dickens’s “Tale of
Two Cities.” Grace Warner, here with her
father, Charles Warner, in ISS9-90, was the
original Lucy Manette to Martin Harvey’s
Carton at the London Lyceum in 1899;
Frank Tyars, here with H. B. Irving in 1911,
was also in the cast. Australia saw “The
Only Way” in 1900, when the Firm produced
it with Tyrone Power as Carton and Edith
Crane as Lucy, the support including Jimmy
Hazlitt, Cyril Keightley, Oily Deering, Cecil
Ward, Rose Musgrove and Florrie Gleeson.
In more remote years Madame Celeste
appeared in Tom Taylor’s version at the
old Vic,, Pitt-street, Sydney. When Celeste
first presented this version under her own
management at the Loudon Lyceum in 1800,
Dickens, according to the bills, “in the kind-
est manner superintended the production.”
For a time Dickens had thoughts of himself
impersonating Carton, but nothing came
of it.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: 1 support “Stage
Wait’s” protest (B. 26/11/’25) against the
importation of complete companies. The
fact that there is no difficulty in padding out
comparatively small cos. to play pieces like
“The Silver King,” “The Royal Divorce”
and “Madame X” at practically a moment’s
notice indicates that the constant job is
a rare thing with many capable pros.
Nellie Bramley required eight people for
“Peg o’ My Heart,” and 19, besides supers.,
for “Madame X.” Although the projected
season was for only 10 nights, and under-
taking the work meant a week’s free re-
hearsals, there was no difficulty in getting
the people. One very competent thespian
has had only 10 weeks’ work in a year,
apart from casual engagements at picture-
shows. The importing of entire companies
means that the Australian mummer will find
liis lxalf-loaf share of his own stage still
further reduced.
“Schnorrer” : Melbourne doesn’t like Jews
very well, and has a tendency to keep away
from performances in which Jews are fea-
tured. Hence (1) its comparative coldness
to Moscovitcli, in spite of critical apprecia-
tion of his work; (2) the empty spaces in
the Tivoli when Harry Green presented his
“Cherry Tree,” one of the outstanding vaude-
ville acts of the year; and (3) its lukewarm
reception of Green and Roy Rene in the
hilarious “Give and Take.” Its frigidity
toward the Chosen People is indicated in
social matters particularly, admittance to
circles which are wide open in Sydney being
grudgingly given in Melbourne. A pos-
sible explanation of the difference in atti-
tude is that Sydney contains a much larger
proportion of the British Jew type, which
lias got farthest away from ghetto traditions.
Still, Melbourne has its Monash and its I.
A. Isaacs.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : At a charity concert
organised the other day by George Robey,
a lightning sketch of the comedian done by
Sir William Orpen was put up for sale
and brought 50 guineas to the fund. The
Orpen and Robey families met in a curious
way last year. Mrs. Robey (Ethel Haydon,
of Melbourne) was staying at a southern
coastal town with her son Teddy and her
daughter Eily. At the same hotel Sir Wil-
liam Orpen was a guest. Miss Robey, who
has studied painting in an amateur way,
was busy with her brush, and one day the
mother introduced herself to the famous
painter in order to get his opinion on her
daughter’s efforts. Orpen pronounced him-
self greatly impressed by the girl’s talent,
offered to help her, and so the friendship be-
gan. Since then Eily Robey has painted
quite a good portrait of her brother, who
is reading for the Bar. Sir Edward Mar-
shall Hall is taking a special interest in
the young fellow’s law preliminaries, but
there is always the chance of a switch-over
to the stage, since Teddy shone at amateur
acting wdiile at Cambridge.
AH, THOSE WERE THE DAYS!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘lgnorant barbarian,’ snorted Mr. Levy. ‘Don’t
speak to me,’ roared Mr. Burke.” —Daily paper report
of N.S.W. Parliamentary Circus.
Oh for the tongues of former times!
Oh for the jaws that wagged them!
Long since for their linguistic crimes
The hand of progress gagged them.
The fury and the spleen are gone,
The days grow wise and clever;
No longer may the bore flow on
For ever and for ever.
The daytime session’s quiet light
Is full of great compassion;
No longer is a threat to fight
Considered in the fashion.
The members very seldom try
Their enemies to smother
Or rise in berserk rage to shy
The seats at one another.
The gory epithets are stilled,
The simple thoughts that fly are
Expressed in language nicely chilled—
The worst is ‘‘You’re a liar.”
The chamber seems in sad decay,
Its heats and stresses slacking;
The glories of an older day
Are absolutely lacking.
But, thank the gods, a little spark
Of verbal emulation
Still trembles through the wordy dark
Of someone’s peroration;
And underneath the quiet air
Of peaceful resignation,
One, hearing more than he can bear,
Roars like a bull of Bashan.

“That’s just what I wanted
for Christmas”
That’s what he will say on Christmas morning if his packet contains
a Valet Auto Strop Razor. For the Valet is the razor every man
wants, the quickest and simplest to use, the most economical in
blades, by far the best for a fine smooth shave.
ď
See how it works.
The strop slips through the razor
head—no undoing or unscrewing—
the razor runs up and down the
strop, turning the blade over and
over. In 10 seconds the blade is
as sharp as new and the same blade
keeps sharp for 50 or 60 shaves —
British
Made

It is the ideal Christmas present.
There is no other razor in the
world like the Valet. Your

.APPOINTMENT TO
THE PRINCE OF WALES
The 19/60-H.P. CROSSLEY
THE 19/60-h.p. Crossley lias probably
attracted more attention than any other
car in its class. Certainly it possesses a
very enviable reputation for all-round efficiency
and sweetness of running, and is recognised as
being a delightful car to handle. From five
miles per hour on top gear it can be rapidly
accelerated to sixty. Everything about the car
speaks of quality, and its road performance
satisfies the most exacting.
Further, the fact that the 19/60-h.p. Cross-
ley broke all 1t.A.0. Certified Trial Car Mileage
Records when it completed 25,000 miles under
the observation of the Royal Automobile Club
supplies ample and conclusive proof of extra-
ordinary reliability. No other car has ever
approached this distance under official observa-
tion. The Crossley completed 25,000 miles with
only 3 J minutes spent on adjustments or repairs
on the” road, and at a total cost we have calcu-
lated to be lid. per mile for oil, fuel and tyres.
Full details of this achievement gladly supplied
on application.
It must be emphasised that the 19/60-h.p.
Crossley is a car far above the ordinary, witn
all the refinements which appeal to the experi-
enced motorist. Built from the finest material
obtainable and with scrupulous care, it is a car
which can be purchased with confidence, and
which will live up to the splendid reputation it
has gained in every part of the world. Petrol
consumption results aye better than those of any
other car of similar capacity.
The 19/60-h.p. Crossley was the first.
British car to run from Adelaide to Darwin and
back under its own power. The car used had
previously run over 30,000 miles.
There are numerous 19/60-h.p. Crossleys on
the road to-day which have already completed
over 150,000 miles, and arc still running as
sweetiy as ever.

-new parts - more models - more fun !
You must get to know the new Meccano parts. There are scores and scores
of them. Models that you couldn’t have tackled years ago are quite easily built
now. That’s what the new parts have done for Meccano and for you. And remem-
ber Meccano models work like the real thing, simply because every Meccano part
is an exact replica in miniature of the real parts engineers use.
If you already have Meccano see that you get some of the new parts and keep
your Outfit right up to date. If you haven’t Meccano —well Christmas will bte
here soon, so why not see Dad about it to-night?
Any toy-shop will show you a Meccano Outfit or get one for you.

Jazzer: Yes, it’s perfectly true that the
dress of that “Little Australia” is out of date. But
how would you like the typical John Bull or Uncle
Sam put into modern clothes?... .D.E.M.: Not
worth its space; but we will pass it on to the
•writer you mention.... The McHaggis: Another got
his spq,on in first. .. .D.M.J.: How dull and uninspir-
ing !.... Eleanor D.: Thanks ; but there is room for
only one reply, and that’s in type... .M.D.: Yes,
but it wouldn’t be quite fair to judge an ocean-
going liner by experiences between Brisbane and
Sydney... .Neanderthal: Haven’t either room or in-
clination for religious discussions. As J. F. Archi-
bald used to say, no smell is the best smell....
M.W.H.: We don’t get very enthusiastic over mis-
shapen animal freaks... .Simplex: Lacks sincerity;
and there’s nothing else of so much consequence....
Tintagel: A poor picture. You want more than an
eye that can see material things for a job like that.
....Betrid: “Finis” is in very good shape; but
what does it mean?... .3941: As confused as a
P. and O. deck on landing day.... Jackdaw: Not
enough there... .J.O.L.: The manner of telling the
yarn is not good and the plot is quite obvious from
the beginning... .E.M.E.: The organist is not very
thrilling. .. .W.D.F.: The mystery yarn is not to
our liking. The verses miss.... Pegasus: All awk-
ward and crude. .. .A.W.D.: An old theme and not
well handled.... B.Z. (Auckland) : Slabs of tortured
prose masquerading as verse... .U.R.E.: The verse
never gets far without a bad stumble G.H.W.:
Not up by a considerable distance... .-M.V.M. :
“Time” is an unequal hash of the commonplace... .
Paul N.: The lines are fairly well constructed, but
the verse lacks interest... .John M.: They wouldn’t
do even if they were not half as bad... .R.H.R.:
Doesn’t strike us... . Bellerive : That’s the true spirit
of the conqueror :—
’Tis moisten the roots or the flowers will die.
’Neath the blaze of the gleaming sun.
Christmas is near, glad season of cheer,
My task as a poet’s not done.
Wrongs and rights for ever will clash.
When starving ’tis time to be glum.
Posey’s my friend to the final end,
When I quit for the Kingdom Come.
What’s the use of genius to man
If he loses he’s faith in hope?
Many a soul, where the billow’s roll,
Has been saved from a wreck by a rope.
Christmas is near, glad season of cheer;
In defence of my art I will fight.
If not ’twill fade behind a cloud s shade
Like a star on a wintry night.
I waded through ordeals in day's of the past,
’Tis folly to ponder and wail.
I’ll break new ground ; I’ll travel around,
And offer my verse’s for sale.
Win and lose is the gamble of life
Struggle on to the end is my plan;
Despite the strain, I’d climb again,
If lowered to where 1 began.
J.R.H.: It has plenty of blood; but the yarn
is very tedious in the telling. ... Iv.S.C.: Crude for
any age... .C.E.S.: You seem to imagine that un-
trained louts from the slums win fights at the
Stadium and that delicate young ladies are there to
applaud.... N.A. (Longueville) : Keeps to the rather
cheap and obvious, and is by no means improved by
the French pretence... .Alec: Not quite enough
there E.O. (Wellington): Not well enough done
and far too long. .. .H.J.C.: No use to us J.B.T.:
Poor stuff....L.S. (Manly): Doesn’t make a yarn.
. ...J.A.K.; Doesn’t strike us... .M.H.H.: How do
you know Stonehenge was a product of slavery?
Nobody else knows R.A.D.: That states the matter
with a certain lucidity of obscurity:—
I sometimes feel clever in the morning
When the sun is on the sea,
But I always forget to be adorning
Some of the best thoughts that come to me
Before breakfast.
The day goes past;
And I am not very clever in the evening
When the sun starts quickly leavening.
What is it to be clever?
Is it to never, never
Remember anything at all?
That’s all right, but I have to snatch
My breakfast and run to catch
The train that is going to call
And get my hat in the hall.
Go to the ant, thou sluggard!
O Ant, what thinketh thou?
Go to the man and bite him hard
To remember to be clever just now.
E.Iv.S.: Form lamentable and thought thin....
W.E.B. : You don’t seem to have any feeling for
verse.... H.B.H.: The old commonplaces offered
without rhyme or reason in a bad setting....
Opal: Send it to the “gracious maid”; if her ear
can stand it and her mind can grasp its subtleties
vou ought to get on well with her.... J.B.C.: Shock-
ing Emel: Nothing there.... Sierra: As slight as
the first faint whisper of the dawn D.B.O.: A
not very cheerful sample of a deadly sort of
highly elevating verse. .. .N.E.R.: Wanted better
verse to carry it B.D. (Moore Park): “The
Sheik” is a bit ragged, and doesn’t make it clear
what he is driving at L.E.D.: It < latters on from
one half-expressed commonplace to another....
P. 0. Mac.: None of them gets near enough to coo-ee
to the printer C.P.W.: We do not re-print; and
there is nothing to make much fuss about in the
verses... . A.J.C.: The lines flutter weakly T.G.L.:
Moves awkwardly to say the obvious... .E.E.M.:
“Fame” hasn’t enough in, it; and the tread is
rather heavy R.W.K.: Too flimsy W.L.P.:
Mere mention of the fact that female persons wear
underclothing. And we won’t swear that it’s a fact,
either H.B.C.: The sun nearly glared its way in,
but it hasn’t quite enough point. The other has too
many ragged corners... .M.G. : Very lumpy
fragment. . . .G.B.: The yarn is heavily handled and
did not stir a whisker M.McI.: Already accepted
all we can on that subject F.G.M.: Too wordy.
The poet has a license; otherwise this paper has
no use for words for their own sake Adamas:
No need to turn to old maps to find that form. For
one, the gas co. which lights the city still spells
itself “Ballaarat” Barney B.: Sorry, but we don’t
think it’s at all a matter for rejoicing Dima:
That pommy who killed new-born pigs in mistake
for rats is a dreadful plagiarist.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
T.S.R.: Binghi’s rock-carving is a masterpiece com-
pared with the distorted person on the weighing
machine C.R.N.: Perspective all wrong in the
first place J.A.R.: Bird’s-eye view of football
match ordered off the premises J.P.P. (F.M.S.) :
We’ll keep the Christmas greetings and return the
drawing... .J.B.C.: Jokes unsuitable... .E.C.: Let
the small boy thrash the problem out with his father,
but not with our readers as witnesses...-E.W.;
The glum-faced archaeologist is anathema R. A.:
Promising; a more tender-hearted journal might
accept them.


When other cars are breaking up
-■ Studebakers are breaking in
OTUDEBAKERS are built to give
v -' thousands of miles of excess trans-
portation. Remarkable records for econ-
omy and endurance were recently made
over a California mountain course by
twenty Studebakers with an average
mileage of over 90,000 miles each. All
finished with high scores. A Studebaker
in Kimberley, South Africa, carrying the
Crown mail, has been driven more than
400,000 miles and is still going strong.
These cases of Studebaker stamina and
long life are typical of hundreds of others.
Savings effected through One-Profit
manufacture allow Studebaker to use
the finest materials and workmanship
without charging prices in proportion to
the high quality and value of the product.

“Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
And health on both ! ”
Shakespeare knew the value of a good digestion —
knew that it f s not what you eat, but what you digest
that lays the foundation of health *
But of all the distressing complaints that attack human beings,
Indigestion i« by far the most commonplace. This depressing,
devitalising ailment is the deadly enemy of health and happiness,
for you can’t feel well when the digestive organs fail to function,
denying your body the necessary nourishment from the food you
eat. In this condition lassitude overcomes you, a morose, irritable
disposition sets in, your breath becomes offensive, the skin dry,
hard and withered : That’s Indigestion. But you can get
well—and quickly too—by the use of that Medical Gem
KRUSE’S .
mM sm
One or two doses will convince you that you are taking the right
medicine. You will feel the difference as the stagnant secretions
are expelled, as they must be if you take the genuine Kruse’s
FUSD
This searching, though non-irritating aperient, more like a sonrkling mineral
water than a medicine, is healthful to people of all ages; and so pure that
it can safely be given to young infants

“A.A.A.”: Re the 200 fat bullocks which
averaged £27 10s. per head at Dunedin (B.
5/11/’25). In 1920 H. F. Hardy, of King
Island (between the Speck and Victoria),
sold 120 head of cows and four-year-old
steers for £4O per head in the paddock. This
is a deal that will take some beating.
* * * •
“Quiz” : After trading between China and
Australia for 40 years, the Changsha is
making her last appearance here. She and
the Taiyuan, a sister ship Avliich covered her
last lap several months ago, were launched
in the same year, and their length of service
in the Australian trade is a record. The
first worn-out cable of the Melbourne trams
was taken to Hong Kong in the Taiyuan 39
years ago and converted into wire nails for
use in tea-chests.
* * * *
“Gregor”: A pest which has lately
arrived to add to the troubles of the cane-
growefi is the rat, in some districts already
responsible for considerable damage to crops.
The enemy is the small brown field variety,
said to increase at a faster rate than even
the sewer-rat. In the Mossman (N.Q.) dis-
trict this new pest is at its worst, and re-
cently one grower had 300 tons of cane out
of a thousand tons destroyed completely by
it. A measure requiring every grower to
keep his cane free of rats would probably
save the industry the loss of huge sums
later on.
*** • *
“Wallaby” : Jones and I have a common
bond—our passion for cheese. But while
my taste for cheese is somewhat catholic,
Jones restricts himself to mild Cheddar and
looks dubiously at Camembert, Gruyere, Gor-
gonzola and other Continental masterpieces.
At last, however, at the new Italian grocer’s
I came across a cheese which I felt sure
Avon Id shake my neighbor’s loyalty to Ched-
dar. On Sunday evening, true to his custom,
Jones dropped in for his nibble. “There you
are, my boy!” I said to him confidently as
I produced my discovery. “Neatly packed,
too, you’ll agree—all the way from Genoa!”
Jones sniffed at it. “All the way from
Genoa, eh?” said he. “Come out under its
own steam?”
* * * *
“Oldson”: I don’t know who had the
honor of producing the first two bales of
cotton grown in the Fassife.n (Q.) district;
but I do know that they must have been
produced considerably more than 40 years
ago (B. 22/10/’25). My dad was reared
in the neighborhood, and, he tells me, wore
his fingers bare at cotton picking before he
was 10. Now lie’s close on 70. Forty-seven
years ago my mother, a new-chum girl, weak
after an illness, ivas sent to a neighbor’s to
pick cotton, this being considered easier
than the land-clearing work she had been
assisting in when she collapsed. ‘ (A.E.Y.”
is probably thinking of the second advent
of cotton growing at Fassifern; but that
is hardly 40 years ago.
* * * *
“Pick” : Australian axe-handles made from
Gourock Range and N.S.W. South Coast
messmate are getting recognition on the
market. They are cheaper than the imported
hickory, and when made from carefully-
selected stuff are equal to it for springiness
and strength. The best material for all kinds
of handles is the water-gum. With light-grey
spiky leaves, a smooth but crevassed bark
and a somewhat slender trunk, it grows along
the banks of the tidal rivers and salt-water
lagoons. The barrel is subject to knot-holes
and other blemishes, but when a good piece
is procured it outdoes American hickory for
toughness, glassy smoothness and durability
under all weather conditions and rough
usage.
* * * #
“Demoness”: The speculation in flats has
not escaped one enterprising crook. The
other day at Coogee (Sydney) he dropped
into a block of mod. self-cont. flats, and,
knocking on each door, announced himself as
the. ne\y landlord. All the tenants believed
him —there hacT'been'“about- five in
two years and most of them reluctantly'
agreed to hand over an extra 10s. for the
first week’s rent under his regime. He ex-
plained that those who didn’t like their
rent increased could pack up and make
room for eager tenants waiting to get pos-
session. Nearly everybody paid, and those
who didn’t have the cash in the house asked
him to call back. But he made a good
enough haul without exposing himself to that
danger.
*“ 'V* S'"*"' * \ *
“Harold Hardupp”: A fresh hardship is
threatening the man who gets over the diffi-
culty of overdoing his credit with one milk-
man by transferring his custom to another.
Melbourne milk-distributors are thinking of
adopting the sensible zone system, in which
case the debtor will have to wander over the
boundary with a jug if he wants to change
his tradesman. The spectacle of half a
dozen milk-carts dashing into one small
street and fighting for its limited custom
is an absurdity that helps to keep up the
price of one of the necessaries of life. A
zone system in regard to bread deliveries
is wanted just as . badly; the newsagents
adopted the principle long ago, to the benefit
of themselves and their customers, and
especially of the newspaper proprietors, who
aren’t troubled with bad debts like they
used to be.
* * * *
“Cue” : No less an authority than Darwin
expressed himself dubious about the future
of Australia between 80 and 90 years ago.
But of all the strange reasons that could be
adduced for lack of faith his reads the
strangest nowadays. The great scientist
opined that to link up the back-country with
the coast a network of canals would be
necessary, and the cost of such would be
prohibitive. It is a reminder of how much
countries like Britain depended on canals
in the pre-railw-ay era. Those canals nowa-
days, with few exceptions, are either out of
commission or have been adapted to other
purposes. Railways superseded them, just
as motor transport is now threatening the
iron horse, and aerial means of travel and
carriage will possibly some day supersede
both. Yet we still regard the railways as
“permanent,” and make no effort to pay off
the loans we have sunk in them.

Compare with pearly teeth
There is a way to whiter teeth, to
cleaner, safer teeth. Millions of homes
have adopted it.
It means new beauty, new protec-
tion. This test will prove that to you.
Make it now, watch the results, then
decide if your folks should use it.
Teeth are clouded by
a film
That viscous film you feel on teeth
is their great enemy—the cause of most
tooth troubles. Under old brushing
methods, much of it clings and stays.
Soon it becomes discoloured, forming
dingy coats. That is how teeth lose
their beauty.
Film also holds food substance
which ferments and forms acid. Germs
breed by millions in it. They, with
1
FjyLM the worst , .
' % enemy to teeth
You can feel it with, your tongue
tartar, are the chief cause of pyorrhea.
Modern science has found ways to
fight film. One disintegrates it at all
stages of formation. One removes it
without harmful scouring.
These methods have proved very
effective. A new-type tooth paste has
been created to apply them daily. The
name is Pepsodent.
No question when you
see it act
Pepsodent results are quick and
conspicuous. They leave no doubt.
Send the form for a 10-Day Tube.
Note how clean the teeth feel after
using.
You will always be glad that you made
this test. Cut out form now.

“Billiken” : “Sir Sir” (B. 24/’9/’25). sug-
gests that S.A. hasn’t anything very striking
in place names. What’s wrong with Nowhere
Else? It’s out in the Back-o’-beyond of
Eyre’s Peninsula.
“Sixenate” : There was bitterness of spirit
as well as brevity in the letter a Melbourne
man lately wrote to a firm of estate agents.
It ran : “Twelve months ago you induced me
to buy land at Geelong, which I purchased
on your representations without inspection.
I have now discovered that it is very low-
lying, and all I have to say to you is that
you are more so.”
“Roaditli” : Politics seeped into unexpected
places last month. At a Melbourne suburban
school an examination in history was in
progress. One question ran: “Write all you
know about Bruce and Bannockburn.” One
small girl weighed in with: “It was Bruce
who was trying to get into Parliament, but
he had a very hard job. He talked to all
the people, and then they went on his side.
I don’t know about the other man.”
“Alwyn”: The first man in Australia to
use electricity to light his business premises
was E. W. Cole, at that time a seller of
books from barrows at the Eastern Arcade
in Melbourne. The first use of gas was
to light a George-street (Sydney) pharmacy.
That was in 1834, seven years before the
Australian Gaslight Company’s plant was
built on Church Hill. McNaughton was the
chemist. He manufactured his gas on the
premises.
The war added to its toll when Captain
W. Elliot Murray died suddenly in Mel-
bourne ; he had been walking with his
mother a couple of hours before a ’phone
message gave her news of his death. Murray
enlisted early in the war, and was sent to
Port Moresby (Papua) to take command of
the troops stationed there. Directly the
danger of German attacks faded, he returned
to Australia to enlist, and became O.C. 3rd
Light Horse Brigade train, with which he
subsequently went to France. Two and a
half years’ campaigning gave him the heart
trouble Which ultimately brought the end.
“Harold Hardupp”: Among the men
rounded up by the Melbourne policy at Cup-
time and presented on a charge of “no law-
ful visible” were three who had energetically
protested they were working as land sales-
men. The police had derisively remarked
that this was an old tale, but when the
accused appeared in court documentary evi-
dence (apparently genuine) was produced
to show that the three men in six weeks had
respectively earned £7B, £143 and £163. The
average land salesman is an impoverished
person “with a penchant for borrowing half-
crowns, but these three apparently have no-
thing to complain about.
“Lab” : While a religious sect in California
has excommunicated one of its members for
producing a new kind of gladiolus contrary
to the scheme of the Creator, the French
Government proposes to allow its horticul-
turists to patent their strains and new
varieties of flowers and vegetables. It is
doubtful if the scheme is workable, but if it
were some enterprising individuals would get
no more than they deserve. If William
James Farrer had drawn a royalty of a tenth
of a penny on every bushel of Federation
wheat that has been grown in Australia from
the original strain he produced at Canberra,
he might not have died a poor man and
ignored in 1906.
“Wings”: The commercial aeroplane in
Australia is not going ahead as fast as was
expected. There were only 59 ’buses in use
at June 30 last, as linst 51 the previous
year; certificated p s had decreased from
27 to 23. But the number of air-miles
covered during the year increased from
269,909 to 392,425, and the business done
was augmented considerably, although fewer
passengers were carried in some States, not-
ably N.S.W., where the tally fell from 1403
to 651. The increase in mileage and business,
synchronising with a decrease in pilots, sug-
gests that regular services run by companies
are displacing the old style of aerial con-
veyance.
“Hamer” : The Postal Department is mak-
ing its telephone-books pay through having
them printed by contract with an advertising
firm. The books used to cost Is 6d. per
subscriber; to-day they cost Id. only. It
is a mere detail that a man utilising the
’phone to inquire about the health of a dear
friend may find an undertaker’s ad. at the
top of the page; or a young man ringing
up his girl about the wedding may be con-
fronted by a recital of the reliable qualities
of some firm of private _ detectives which
specialises in securing Divorce Court evi-
dence. On the first issue under the new
system a whisky ad. annoyed the unco guid,
and, in deference to their objections, it was
eliminated. Still, if ’phone-book advertising
is to be regarded as legitimate, the cold-tea
crowd could buy space just as easily as
distilleries and breweries. Incidentally, it
may be recalled that the scheme for earning
a little extra revenue through accepting ad-
vertisements for the back of tram-tickets
was abandoned in N.S.W. because the people
who were found most anxious to avail them-
selves of the privilege were the quack-
medicine charlatans whom the Government
particularly wanted to discourage.
“Feng-Shui” on the worship of Bacchus:
A long, low room with double rows of bunks on
either side. Spotlessly clean. A coolie attendant in
patched white tunic and sloppy pants. The musty,
sweet smell of camels’ dung from the door shrine,
and another sweeter and more stifling smell which
hangs about the bunks. Two patrons are lying full-
length, their shaven heads close to one another. They
talk drowsily. Gradually their eyelids drop and
their heads fall back on to their pillows. Outside
the opium-den an English and an American sailor
are roaring arm-in arm down the narrow street,
driving a rickshaw-coolie before them with an empty
bottle] The rum fleet is cruising up and down the
12-mile limit off the American east coast with pre-
ventive vessels watching it; and in Tientsin, where
opium-smoking is illegal, the barrowmen are lining
up in front of the Japanese chemists’ shops for their
early-morning hypodermic injection. Away on
the Roper River the lubras are out looking for the
fruit of the corkscrew palm, whose intoxicating pro-
perties make their lords for the moment feel stronger
than the spirits. “One must be for ever drunken,”
said Baudelaire, whose preference was hashish. “With
wine, with poetry, with virtue, with what you please
—but be drunken.” Omar Khayyam chose wine,
General Booth virtue, and the late William Jennings
Bryan potatoes.

Excepti □ nal Rid ine Comfo rt
The riding comfort of a motor-car is not
dependent upon its length, weight or cost,
any more than the comfort of a home
depends upon its size.
If the seats are deep enough and the proper
distance from the floor; if the seat backs
are correctly pitched for relaxation; if the
upholstery is sufficiently stuffed and there
is plenty of leg room; above all, if the
springs are rightly designed and of proper
length, you will have exceptional riding
comfort. Otherwise, you will not.
Dodge Brothers, with characteristic
thoroughness, studied and experimented
with these details for years. Their findings
were ultimately incorporated in the design
of Dodge Brothers Motor Car —without
question now a vehicle that ranks with
the first in this vitally important feature.

Terrible
Burn by
Rexona—

Healer.
“I always advise my friends to use Rexona Ointment and Rexona Soap, for
I consider them par excellence. I had a serious burn on my left arm, which
was scarred so badly that I could not leave my long gloves off without having
every eye upon me. As I had always used Rexona Soap with satisfaction for
several years, I decided to drop my visits to the hospital and try, Rexona Oint-
ment. I am pleased to state that in two weeks it completely healed my whole
arm and both hands. I kept on applying it every night before retiring, and
now you could scarcely recognise that I was ever burned so severely. My
friends and myself were so gratified with the wonderful results that I can
assure you I shall always keep a tin handy in the future, and recommend it
on every occasion. 1 particularly want to mention that the brown burns are
now T white, and the scars scarcely noticeable.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOU are my father and I am your
daughter, called into life by you.
I sit at your feet in the twilight sweet
in a world that is strange and
new;
In the world of to-day that you understand,
that is yours to make or to mar,
I follow your gaze through the murky haze
to distances dim and far.
I follow' your flight through the realms of
space, for your spiyit lends me wings.
Like a parent kind, you must guide my mind
in the wmrld of men and things;
For my mind, as far as you understand, is
that of a child at play,
While yours is the mind of a man at work,
for yours is the wmrld of to-day.
lam your mother and you are my child. In
anguish I gave you birth.
And lost to my gaze in the sunlight rays, you
wandered upon the earth
Till I found you lonely as child could be
and I drew you straight to my breast;
And you closed your eyes in glad surprise
and wearily sank to rest.
Did you think, poor child, that you were
the first, as I was the first to you?
Full many like you I have loved and lost:
and yet I am pure and true.
So give to me all that I ask for now 7 and
cherish me wdiile you may;
For my life is long as an angel’s song and
yours is but of a day.
Yours is the world to make or to mar and
yours are the realms of space;
Mine is the life of a loving wife and the fate
of the human race.
Boundless your vision and power of thought,
though your life be only a span;
Mine is the near, the true and the dear, the
nurture and care of man!
Daughter of savage and mother of God, mine
is eternal life;
Yours is the power of the day and the hour.
They call us husband and wife.
Divided we fall, united w 7 e rise to the super-
man from the brute.
Yours is Infinity; mine is Eternity; ours is
the Absolute!

GEORGE WINTER.
The Blue Ear-rings.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IS he went aw 7 ay in the morning wearing
his old clothes that smelled of fish,
he stopped and kissed her on the
lips, gently, reverently. “Dear little wife-
little Saint-eyes,” he said at the beginning of
the tiled path.
The wind -was blowfing scraps of paper and
chaff along the gutters. A few T leaves hang-
ing on to the bare plane-boughs flapped like
half-dead fish. She stood at the gate with
her check apron billowfing out.
“Aw, I don't think!” she said -with a
shrug.
She watched him apathetically until he
had lumbered past the hotel-corner —an im-
mense block of a fellow with a short, red
neck and broad shoulders. A man with a
little cart was passing along the middle of
the street. She wondered if he would look
her way. It was worth w 7 hile waiting to see.
“Mussels ! Mussels ! All fresh from the
sea-o!”
He turned and grinned, made an extra-
vagant salutation.
She flushed and dimpled, and was satis-
fied. She heard the clatter, and the song
dying away down the mean street.
“All fresh from the sea-o! All fresh!”
She walked up from the gate in shoes that
went over a little at the side. She wanted
to think. She had a lot to think of to-day.
Rut she always found it difficult to think.
She couldn’t concentrate. When she tried
to fasten her mind on something she
only found herself saying dully: “Lor, them
tiles want a wash ! I’ll run a rag over them
later if I have time.”
The memory of that farewell kiss at the
gate was still with her, irritating her.
Faugh! She flung up her head, her pretty
eyes crinkled at the corners. He always
kissed her like that —young Bill! As though
she was one of those painted Virgins in the
church!
She went into the kitchen. The cat was
licking the fat out of the frying-pan by the
fire. Its tongue made a rough, jarring noise.
She did not notice. She was thinking that
all men did not kiss like Bill. Certainly not
that other who was in her mind a great deal
—the black-haired stevedore whose look
seemed as though it would scorch her. His
embrace would bruise and hurt, lie was a
man. But Bill! She kicked the cat away
abstractedly.
Old Mother Ryan was beating her tat-
tered bit of carpet in the next yard. Thud!
Thud! Dull, heavy thwacks that carried no
echo. Like a stick coming into contact with
flesh. She thought oddly that Bill would
never beat her like that —never. Bill was
only half a man. That other would ! Thud !
Thud! Thud!
She went to the back door and looked out.
Thirty houses along the street, with their
backs looking towards Fisherman’s Bend.
All the wmmen with scraggy hair and lined
faces, and hands scarred and reddened, toil-
ing for their men who came home from the
factories and wharves and fishing-boats!
How many of these, having husbands, had
lovers too? She stared out over the flat
stretch of windy green to where lay the
distant city, roseate and half-suggested, and
full of enchantment. All the back- yards
opened out on to this grass-grown bend, and
the people threw their rubbish there—bits
of tin that glittered in the sun, peelings,
bottles, old boots, evil-smelling vegetables.
She was a tidy little soul, and she hated to
see that litter. Bill, however, never bothered.
He seemed to see beyond it —right to the dis-
tant. half-unreal outline of the city.
“Those spires,” he would say softly, “look
at ’em, and the masts of the ships! Like a
dream —like a picture—all of it!”
Faugh!
She went about her work quietly. In the
bedroom she looked in the cracked glass. Her
hair was pulled down over her ear on one
side. It was always like that. She pulled
the yellow, teased lump of hair up. A blue
ear-ring was clasped on to the pretty white
lobe. There w r as nothing on the other one.
She caught her breath as the hair dropped
back in place. Was she pretty? Was she
really as pretty as the handsome stevedore
said? She smiled secretly. She would see
him that night. He would be waiting after
dark where the little canal shot back in the
shadow of the factory wall. He had waited
there last night too. She had pictured him
all the evening, his stocky form against the
boats and fishing-nets. But she had not
been able to get away. Bill, with his wor-
shipping eyes upon her, had chained her in
as securely as though he had bolted the street
door.
But to-night! She shuddered as she swept
up. It was Wednesday. She would say:
“This is the night when I always go to
see my brother’s wife. Good-night!” and
she would slip out —out along to the “little
dock,” where her lover would be waiting for
her by the factory wall. How cold it would
be down on the sand! The chill of it, fine
and smooth in your fingers. The sharp feel
of the tufted, wiry grass! The damp smell
of the oozy stuff under the little piers! And
the dark! She remembered the faint odors
that always clung about his clothes. They
were redolent of the wharves and all that
came there —the tarry ropes; the fresh,
strange-smelling timbers; the grain and oils.
When Bill came in she was dishing up
the vegetables. She listened to the water
running from the outside tap as she mashed
the potatoes with the black-handled fork.
He seemed to take longer than usual to wash
himself. And he was more silent than usual
as he sat down on the wooden chair, pulling
it well under the table. She watched him
dully. Presently he spoke.
“Man fell in the canal to-day,” he said
in his soft, slow voice. “Just before dark.
A stevedore. Done for. Dead. Not the
drowning, but the way he hit his head ag'in
the end of a boat.”
She nodded uninterestedly. He was feel-
ing in his handkerchief. He pulled some-
thing out and held it in his palm.
“Found this caught on to the inside of
his pocket,” he went on in his gentlest voice.
“Some woman had giv’ it to ’im—a blue ear-
ring !”
He put the trinket on the table. It lay
a blob of blue against the cabbage-dish. The
girl made a noise in her throat as though
she swallowed. Her fork rattled down on
to the floor. She picked it up, but there
was no color in her face when she looked up.
Bill leaned across, pushing aw r ay the
plates. A smile seemed to cut his big face
in two.
“Ought to be a pair of them,” he said
pleasantly. “Any rate, put it on your ear.
You used to w r ear blue. I've got a kind of
fancy”
She cowered in her chair, making a ges-
ture of repulsion.
“No, Bill; not from the hands of a dead
man!”
“Aw, come over,” he said playfully, “Give
us your ear.”
She shut her eyes as he came closer. He
fastened it in, taking infinite care. She
gave a little moan.
“Ah, did I hurt you?” He caressed her.
His big hands were shaking.
She did not eat any more. Bill chewed
steadily on to the end, drew his chair back
and then went into the other room. She
took the things over to the sink and stood
leaning on her elbow, watching the tap drip
sullenly. She could see, as it were, the
wraith of herself standing there —with two
car-rings dangling under her combed-up
yellow hair. She had given that ear-ring to
him three nights before. The second one
wouldn’t come out easily. “I’ll give it to
you when I come to you,” she had said
laughing. “Wait till then !”
And he was dead—the big, handsome steve-
dore with the look that scorched. Probably
he had been drinking and had fallen in. She
knew that he couldn’t swim. To think that
Bill should have been the one —she wanted
to know more about it. She dared not ask.
Yet if Bill knew- —if Bill knew all, what
would he do? Nothing! Kill her or even
beat her? No! He was only half a man.
She wgshed the dishes, drawing little sob-
bing breaths. Now he would have been wait-
ing there by the fishing-nets. And she would
have been finishing up in a hurry all rosy
and excited and happy.
The wind came crying in from the sea.
It rattled the windows. Bill was whistling
softly and contentedly. He got up and put
his great arms round her as she came in
shrinkingly. She was very still.
“You’re so white, little Saint-eyes, like the
wing of a' gull,” he said. “Are tired?
Came, put on something, and we will go for
a fci-ttle walk. You are not going to your
bjljther’s wife.”
■•lie shook her head dumbly, went out, and
came back with a hat on.
He opened the front door. The wind blew
in and set the Japanese joy-bells ringing
in the passage. The little bits of jangling
glass seemed to be laughing.
“Charlie on at the Victory,” he said. “But
I don’t want pictures. It’s a walk.” How
tightly he held her arm ! She found herself
thinking: “Lord, how he loves me!”
They followed the edge of the water.
There was a darkness over the sea. Out of
it crept strange little whimpering noises.
Sometimes grey-black drifts came bellowing
out from the sea and she was almost blown
off her feet.
“Whoa there, my seagull,” he would say,
steadying her, and she could feel the two
ear-rings dangling under her blown hair.
They got round near where the “little
dock” shot into the shore, and she hfing
back. Not there by the canal where the
boats rocked and the fishing-nets Were hung
out to dry! Not there! Not there where
he would have been waiting for her to cotne,
counting the minutes and peeking out
through the dark.
“Let’s go back. I’m cold,” she stammered
in her husky monotonous voice.
“There’s those that are colder,” he said
pleasantly. “Come on!”
They passed the wall of the factory and
seemed to leave the wind behind them. Thry
came into a sudden silence. In the “little
dock” the water hadn’t a movement. Under
the glimmer of light from the corner she
could see the water lying dark and slimy and

green, and by the little steps the shrouded
form of Marietta, Bill’s little fishing-boat.
Stinging tears crept up under her eyelids.
If the water would only break and sob! But
this silence! Everything muffled up and
bearing down upon her! She was going to
scream. She felt it rising in her throat,
rising, rising—like a tide that gurgles up
between narrow rocks, higher, higher!
The man’s fingers were round her arm.
They were pressing into her flesh. “Down
here,” he said easily.
Somehow her feet found the steps. Her
brain was asking stupidly: “Why? Why?
Why?”
The smell of the dead fish rose to her
nostrils, nauseating and compelling. The
cold air seemed to be creeping in through
the cracks of the wooden walls. Below her
was the boat. Above her the face of Bill
glimmering like a murky moon. She felt
rather than saw that he was smiling. Her
mind, reaching out for something to lay hold
of, only clutched some commonplace thought,
registered some trivial thing.
Her foot was in the boat now, and it was
rocking. Bill was beside her, fumbling with
some matches and a lantern.
“Look!” he whispered, drawing back a
canvas flap. There was still a smile on his
face. “Look!” he whispered again.
She stumbled back in horror. She was
staring at a dead body. It was the body
of her lover, the stevedore.
She fell forward. Her hands came in
awful contact with the dripping stiff shoul-
ders. She lurched back. The scream that
had never risen to her lips died in her
throat. She made some inarticulate noise.
Bill knew. Bill knew all about it. What
then?
“Ha,” the _man said softly. “Give the
poor devil what he wanted. The two ear-
rings. Quick! Off with them!”
Crouching in the boat, she moaned like
an animal in pain. One she detached. The
other
“I can’t,” she moaned. “The fastening—
I can’t!”
“Take your time,” he advised gently.
“Surely you’re not nervous, little Saint-
eyes !”
The boat rocked. The tackle at the bottom
rattled and rolled. She had the second
trinket in her fingers. There was a drop
of blood on her ear when she took her hands
away.
“Put them in his hands,” said Bill, laugh-
ing softly.
Then she was down on her knees jabber-
ing incoherently in terror, pleading, praying.
“Give ’em to the poor devil,” he said
again, pushing her fingers.
She unfastened the two stiff hands. God!
Would she ever forget the feel of those dead
fingers? There was green slime and a wisp
of seaweed on one wrist. She tried to draw
the flesh down over the bine trinkets.
Bill was still laughing with a ticking noise.
“Help me,” he whispered. “He must be
found drowned, you know!”
He began to push. The boat rocked.
There was a dull splash.
“Up!” he commanded. “Up!”
She climbed up, feeling the top step
blindly.
“I useter love dances, and picnics, and
chaps,” she was muttering. “Chaps taking
notice. Not them that thought I was a saint
on a picture postcard” She wondered
dully why she was saying that.
On the top he caught her arm, thrusting
his face into hers. “He must have been
drunk when he fell in,” he said in a rustling
whisper. “His head struck wood. There
was no one else about just then. I pulled
him into the boat. I was foolin’ round with
the tackle. He wasn’t dead. I picked up
the blue thing. He started to babble. He
didn’t know what he was sayin’. I did. I
listened a bit. Then I knew he was dead.”
Again his fingers almost met in the soft
flesh of her arm. She moaned. “You’d be
in there too, little Saint-eyes,” he said
gently, “only it suits me better to have you
remember dead hands —an’ all!”
The wind bellowed out as they went be-
yond the factory wall. They went on, two
grey, rather terrible figures walking abreast.
“God —O my God!” she was saying
under her breath. “The joy-bells will ring
when we open the front door!”
MYRA MORRIS.
The Philosophy of the Primitive.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FROM a low branch on a slender tree
in the jungle Kus Kus looked down
with apparent unconcern at the lean,
snarling dog which fixed blazing eyes
upon him. The murder threat in the eyes of
the dog made Kus Kus fasten his claws even
more tightly in the bark of the limb. Even
had he been possessed of that resilient
strength that once had been his, he would
not have descended from his sanctuary to
give battle.
But Kus Kus realised that he was no
longer young. A couple of years back he had
been cornered by Sisia and his two brothers.
Then he had shown then his strength.
One of Sisia’s brothers he had slashed
mortally, the other he had clawed so terribly
that the dog had died in blinded misery three
days afterwards and a hundred yards away
from the scene of the battle. His arch-
enemy Sisia he had dealt a razor-clawed
slash from forehead to muzzle that made the
snarling face even more sinister.
For a little while longer the dog glared
upward, the hair on his back erect, his lean
throat vibrating with the choking threat of
murder. Then he wheeled and glided off
like a yellow shadow, noiseless and furtive,
his eyes and nose close to the ground.
For the moment Kus Kus was relieved
from the strain of those flaming eyes, but
he knew that the watcher would be back
again soon. lie knew’ that in the mind of
Sisia he was condemned, sentenced to death
between those gleaming fangs.
With the disappearance of Sisia his limbs
set up a trembling reaction. He allowed his
tense body to relax on the limb, while his
mind wandered back to the period of his
life when lie had possessed that wonderful
vitality which left him in fear of nothing in
the jungle trails. For a New Guinea ’possum
in his full strength has little to fear from
any hunter except man. He has no natural
enemies except the tribes of wild dogs, and
of these he has no fear. There are no
larger beasts of prey, and man bothers him
but little. The far is far inferior to the
Australian possum s, the tail being almost
nude. Fear of the dogs comes only with the
failing strength of a f Now it bad come to
Ivus Kus. His right hind leg ached where,
twelve months before, the teeth of Sisia had
closed on it and rended the sinews. The wound
had healed, but it had left him with stiffened
muscles which were now always likely to
betray him when he sprang to the trees and
clawed his way aloft to safety.
The dipping sun slanted on him through
the leaves, showing up the patchy fur, the
small “rumped” areas of skin. Any animal-
lover would have sensed the pathos of the
musings of the ageing golden-white animal on
the bough, in whose rheumy eyes the joy of
life had died, and whose mere existence was
becoming too great a burden.
But Kus Kus was too primitive to toy with
regrets. His mind wanderings always
brought him back to a starting-point—Sisia
Something m the big tree-dweller rebelled
violently against the _ manner of the death
which seemed so certain.
It was Sisia who had proclaimed the feud;
and Kus Kus was bitterly aware that bisia
was an arrant coward, knew that Sisia s
exhibitions of hatred were only born of his
enemy’s increasing weakness. To die be-
tween the teeth of a coward! The muscles
of Kus Kus twitched. No fighting animal is
without pride
His primitive brain sought a way out. The
sun sank slowly behind the forbidding moun-
tain ranges. With the sudden darkness came
the hum of the tropical insects. Kus Kus
drowsed fitfully, his slumbers often pene-
trated by the padding and whining of a form
below the tree.
Animals can hate with fierce intensity,
and hatred stalked Kus Kus that, night even
in his dreams. He knew that his hours were
numbered, but with the philosophy of the
primitive he made the most of liis safety and
slept as best he might.
Ihree more days and nights dragged by.
Kus Kus did not eat. He was never hungry.
He scarcely moved in the fork of the tree,
but his head hung lower and lower. In the
dawning satisfaction, a realisation that the
big body above him would soon topple to the
ground with a thud, when he could pounce
upon its throat and shake the dying life from
it. The dog licked his chops.
Soon—very soon ! Sisia ran a red tongue
out along liis jowls, while moisture drooled
from the mouth and nostrils of Kus Kus.
who still looked down in the direction of
the waiting murderer in blinking, feeble de-
fiance and contempt.
The hours drifted by, but Sisia now no
longer left his post every little while. He
lay crouched watchfully, his nose on his
paws.
Kus Kus came to himself with a start. In
liis stupor he had almost slipped from the
tree, and it wms with difficulty that he hauled
himself safely on the bough again. From
down below came a whine of disappointment,

on tbe yellow'muzzle were pointed back along
the hino-le track sniffing with distrust. He

heavily to the ground, almost in tront or
the surprised white man, whose revolver had
been instantaneously drawn,
But the patrol-officer did not stare long
at the body in front of him. At a threaten-
ing growl he looked up and met the glaring
eye§ of a wild dog. The hate of the animal
was greater than his caution. Too late Sisia
emitted a yelp of fright. Too late instinct
warned him that he had over-reached him-

_ Scott waved his bearers back from their
intended assault, for he began to realise the
little jungle drama he had interrupted. His

vor, while lie watched the ascent of Kus
Kus with understanding and compassion in
Ins eyes. He was wondering if it would not
bp more kind to end the flickering life in
the ’possum, but knew the desire of wild
things to die in their lairs. He waited.
Kus Kus slipped back many times, fal-

He grunted an order, and his little train
moved off. just as a native returned with the
body of a dog. Kus Kus could just distin-
guish in the blur the yellow body of his
enemy, then it was gone. His own time was
near, but was content in the philosophy
of the primitive. He looked once more around
him at the jungle he had roamed in the
strength of his pride and fearlessness; then
he braced himself for the final effort. His
body disappeared into the hole,
