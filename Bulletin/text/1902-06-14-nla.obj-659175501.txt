There is apparent from the first a strong line of
demarcation between the two great schools of
democracy, the Greek and the Gothic • the formei
o paternalism, the latter to individual-
ism. xhis distinction survives to tliis day, popu-
ar government in the Latin races (borrowing
their thought from the Greeks) generally favorin-
-5 m ‘r'f Gern ? amc (° r Gothic) races, ii
dividuahsm. [A notable exception to this la.
generalisation is that of Marx, the great Germa
the f° tl i V il t ’t but hn e * istence ba » to stand again,
the fact that practically all the great individuali
tie democrats have been of the Teutonic race
? deaa , of freedoih—differing in that th
one held that the power of the State should b
great, the othbr that the power of th
State should be as slight as possible, bu
agreeing m behevmg that the power, whatever it
extent, should be absolutely in the hands of th
people—seem to have sprung into being quit
independently, a Divine inspiration, coming to
and being absorbed in, two different national tern
peraments, losing nothing of its essential truth
either, but being tinged by each differently.
Perhaps the ideal democracy of the future wil
be eclectic, combining paternalism and iiidivi
dualism—not an impossible thing at all as mia-h
seem at first thought. There is good in both-h
the compassion of paternalism as in the ruo-gec
independence of individualism. Certainly the
Australian democrat should know something o
both. Compare the mam features of the Homeric
demoeracy-germ with the Gothic :
I 9aa OMERIC! i ate J^ s bxed by Herodotus abou
1200 years before Christ). The dignity of labor
was recognised Kings worked and princesses
helped to wash the linen. Chiefs were such not
only because of supposed divine birth hut of
prowess in battle or skill in speech. The Kinsr’s
title was “shepherd of the people.” He was
assisted in the task of government by a Council of
the people. This Parliament was oftfen appealed
to tor a decision between opposing chiefs. Thus
I elemachus calls the Parliament of Ithaca together
to decide Detween him and the Suitors. In these
I ariiaments there was almost absolute freedom of
speech, I hus Thersites addresses the Chief of the
Kings before Troy
Atrides, what now are you after ? Your tents are full of
spoil and of dainty women whom the Achaeans gave to
you whenever they sacked a city. . . It is but little
seemly for you, being the King, to bring in yo U “ .reed
woes on the Achaean men—nay knavish, worthless
Achaean women, not men, to suffer you. Truly we are
brought here to Troy to collect spoil for this fellow
who even now has despitefully treated Achilles, a much
better man than himself.
That is language which no subject would dare use
towards an absolute King. The same freedom of
debate is noticeable elsewhere, and it'is always
observable that the assembly of the people is con-
sulted before any- important action as' taken So
important is the result of the deliberations of this
assembly that to be a fine speaker is almost as
good as to be a fine soldier. Next to warlike
prowess the gift of logical eloquence is the greatest
At the apemblies there is a “public opinion”:
cm which point let Gladstone speak as to the

?!dt‘ Hf nerak shared the authority of the king,
vyljff Heir power rather by their courage than
by any authority. A citizen could not be flogged
or chained, or punished by the king or general;
the power of punishment was left to the priests
as representatives of the gods. Women took an
almost equal share with the men. in the
functions °f government. All small matters
tie chiefs decided; all important subjects
were decided by a free Parliament of the
citizens. The lead in these assemblies was taken
by the king or a chief famous either for lineage,
or valor, or for eloquence. If his views were not
agreeable his voice was drowned with clamor.
Lii ere was no regular and certain way of conven-
ing this Parliament; the people would only come
when it suited them. Parliament tried offenders
against the laws, punishing by death or fine.
Arms were carried by all. Courage and skill in
battle were the paths to nobility. The people did
not build cities, living in small, scattered villages;
each one surrounded his house with a great space
or ground. The women were chaste, and any vio-
lation of the marriage contract was punished by
death. Slavery was almost confined to those
taken m war, and its bond was not irksome; the
slave had his own house and his own family life
only paying tribute to his master. Usury was
Unknown. The land was tilled communally,
touch was the Gothic democracy—-severe, simple
sternly individualistic, giving the least possible
power to king or chief, preserving to the indivi-
dual almost complete independence.
. 6 vital differences between the two great
springs from which arises modern democracy are
easily noticeable. The Homeric Parliament could
be quickly and regularly summoned; it followed
its king unless there was-grave reason to the con-
trary : its decisions were binding and far-reach-
ing ; its members were accustomed to that aban-
donment of individual liberty which is involved
in building and inhabiting cities. The Gothic
L arhament was tumultuous, irregular. It only
came together when the whole people were deeply
moved by some cause. Its decisions would have
no effect except in regard to truly national
matters, the Gothic peoples were so intolerant of
authority that they would not even collect
together in towns. Their system was, in short, an
anarchy tempered by a criminal court arid a wat-
otiice, • v ■ -
The Homeric polity shows the germ of a
modern highly - organised liberty-loving but
collectivist state ; the Germanic polity the
genu of such a state as Herbert Spencer
once dreamed of—a state holding the land
m common, preserving with fierce vigor the
utmost degree of individual liberty and holding
obedience, even to a popularly-constituted
authority, as something irksome, when not actually
digraceful. Each system had its good and its bad
features—the one naturally tending to degenerate
into an oligarchy the other into an anarchy. How
far the historical development of each, in success
and failure, has helped to a judgment of the
intrinsic worth of each, is a problem calling for
deep research.
F.R.
Why not a Twang?
Every few weeks for several years past there is
published in some paper .(and often it is the
Australian Bulletin) a paragraph or anecdote or
article rebuking the Australian child for possess-
ing a twang.” Why should Australia not have
its dialect like every other country in the world?
Ihe twang is a national distinction of great
importance. The community of language is a
stronger factor in patriotism than even the ties of
religion and race. The man whose tongue is
English or French or German is to all intents an
Englishman, a Frenchman, or a German. Who
can deny that the oneness of the United States
has not been to some extent dependent upon the
American twang so abhorred by the superior
English person l Anyhow that twang is insisted
upon and accentuated by Americans in foreign
lands as their trade-mark of nationality
amt the Americans who try to imitate the
English bleat generally seem to end up
by becoming naturalised as English citizens
A dialect is partly the result of physical character-
istics dependent upon the soil and climate, and
to a lesser degree, of association. The Australian
calls _a cow a keeyow because the air he has
breathed and the food he has eaten make keeyow
the natural way for him to pronounce the word.
Ihe recent Bulletin writer who told the story of
the schoolboy reciting “Casabianca” to the in-
spector in “ perfect English ” and then calling for
the inspector s horse in pure Australian hit the
mark in one. While he was reciting, the boy
was subjected to an entirely artificial strain. To
all intents and purposes he was reciting in a
foreign language-; and it is just as futile
to expect him to carry his “ perfect
English into private life as it is to sud-
pose that a tame cockatoo is going to converse
with his wild brethren in the invective, learned in
the shearing shed. Despite all the efforts of the
superior-school inspector, the future Australian
will-say keeyow and will hail the other man who
says keeyow as a man and a brother. It must not
• ten that language is the strongest factor
in the development of national character, and
until he has at least an accent of his own, the Aus-
tralian can’t expect to be anything but a sort of
caricature of a Briton.
H. G.
an undergraduate, the famous Jowett was
" -rowdiness, and was one of a set who
prided themselves on their collection of pilfered
door-handles, signboards, bell-handles, etc. One
day, after many raids, a Fellows’ meeting agreed
to raid Jowett s room, on spec. They founc
Jowett in, but nothing of board or sign. As
We l e dej6c ; tedl >' looping downstairs, vener
able with age, learning and virtue, the graceless
Jowett, always apt at Scriptural malappropria
tion remarked, loudly and blandly: “A blood
thirsty and adulterous generation seeketh after
a sign, but no sign shall be given them.”

A SHORT HISTORY OF THE WAR.
[Much more accurate than those published fey the
last week. ]
Wernher, Abrahams and Beit,
Subro, the Amalekite,
Joseph Joel, Judas Joses
(Claiming- a descent from Moses),
Sturdy Britons to the core,
Having manifold possessions
Naturally wanted more.
Regeisbach and Mo-:enthal
Gazed beyond the river Vaal,
Saw a land of peace and plenty.
Dreamed of ten per cent., or twemty.
Rooked and sighed, and longed for war.
“ This,” they said, in perfect Yiddish,
“ Must undoubtedly be British
Should have been so long before.’*
Cecil Rhodes, Imperial wag,
Trotted out the British flag,
Cried, in broken tones, “ Hie jaeet,
Beers’s chief commercial asset,
Scorned and slighted on the floor.”
Showed it trampled on and crumpled,
Ruined, rifled, rent and rumpled
By the unprogressive Boer.
Then the Press, with one accord,
Called for Justice and her sword.
No one thinks the Times a bigot
Since the days of blameless Pigott— '
Pigott, whom we all deplore ;
So the pious British Tory
Swallowed the affecting story—
Swallowed it, and asked for more.
Bernheim, Hirschhorn, Peiser, Beit,
Wisely didn’t stay to fight;
Only now the blows are ended,

WHAT WARNER’S SAFE
CURE DOES.
WARNER’S SAFE CUBE
The remarkable power possessed by Warner’s Safe Cure in over-
coming all diseases of both the liver and kidneys is conceded by
scientists and specialists throughout the woild.
WARNER’S SAFE CURE
——
Restoring to health and activity the kidneys and liver, necessarily
cures all disorders arising from the failure of those important organs
to cleanse the blood of urea, uric acid, and other poisonous impurities.
indigestion and Dyspepsia
Are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure, for the simple reason that good
digestion is assured when the liver and kidneys are acting normally.
The digestive organs are then supplied with pure blood, which is in a
condition to absorb nutriment freely.
Biliousness and Headache
are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. When the liver and kidneys are
properly performing their duties there is no such thing as biliousness,
no such thing as headache. All bile formed is duly delivered to the
intestines, and act as nature’s catharthic.
Rheumatism, Sciatica,
Lumbago, and Gout,’
Are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. These disorders all arise from
the presence in the blood of urinary and biliary poisons, due to the
defective action of the kidneys and liver. As soon as the kidneys and
liver are restored to health these poisons are expelled from the system
in a natural manner, and these diseases are consequently cured.
Neuralgia
is cured by Warner’s Safe Qure. Neuralgia is caused by poverty of
blood, and the excruciating pain felt is but the demand of the nerves
for richer blood. A healthy action of the kidneys and liver ensures
rich blood.
Anaemia and Debility
are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. This medicine, causing as it does,
the liver and kidneys to act perfectly, every particle of food eaten goes
to replace nature’s waste and build up the constitution. A proper
and generous diet is all that is then necessary to make the weak strong
and the pale face flush with the bloom of health.
Blood Disorders
mummßMmmmmamaaßmammmammmmmmmßmmmmmmm
Are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. Pure blood is incompatible with
boils, skin eruptions, etc. Warner’s Safe Cure, by inducing a perfect
action of the kidneys and liver, causes all impurities to be extracted
from the blood and to be expelled from the body.
Gravel and kindred Troubles
Are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. The specific action of the medicine
upon the kidneys and other organs restores them to health; the
. accumulated acids are dissolved, and the troubles cease.
Bright’s Disease
Is cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. This remedy is the only medicine
known to science which will cure this dread disease.
So many millions of bottles of Warner's Safe Cure have been used in all pai $
of the world that it is now easy for anyone to make inquiry amongst persoi l
friends, and as a result become convinced as to the marvellous curative propertie t
the medicine. A pamphlet containing further particulars will be sent, post paid *
any address on application to H. H. Warner & Co., Limited, Australasian bru

A Champion Athlete
PAYS THE
Penalty for Continuous Training
And Finds a Welcome Antidote.
The Case of Mr. $. MAHALM.
(fob the leichhabdt “ sTiiNnARr).”)
To judge from the numerous successes i»
all kinds of sport which have been placed
to the credit of Australians it appears that,
as a people, we possess the necessary
stamina and skill required to excel in various
departments of athletics; but, as Mr.
Samuel Mahalm, of Augustus street, Leich-
hardt, told our reporter, it is quite possible
to overtax one’s constitution, and then
trouble ensues.
“In your palmy days as an athlete you
did. not think that so much training and
racing was likely to do you harm, I
suppose ?” remarked a Standard reporter.
“I did not give it a thought, to tell you
the truth,” replied Mr. Mahalm. “I was
too enthusiastic in matters of sport to
trouble about the future, but now that I am
all right again I do not regret having in-
dulged in exercise so heavily.”
“It was in rowing that you principally
excelled, was it not ? ”
“ Well, yes; I did meet with a fair
amount of success in that line, as I won the
champion sculls for youths under 21 three
years in succession, and was pitted against
some of the old-time champions besides. In
running, rowing, and sailing I won twenty
taces out of twenty-seven starts, so I have
not much to complain about in that respect,
although, when my health broke down, I
thought the game was not worth the candle,
as the saying goes. It is an aw jul strain on
one’s system to keep at such heavy work
continuously, and when I got very ill I
considered that my success was dearly
bought.”
“ What was the first sign you had that
your health was breaking down ? ”
“ Nervousness. The frequent strains
upon my system had a bad effect on my
nerv s, for they became so unstrung that I
could not keep them steady, and the most
simple thing in the world could give me a
start and make me excited. I went on like
this fora little while, thinking that I would
soon be all right again, when I was greatly
surprised to find that I was suffering from
indigestion. That was an every-day sort of
complaint, I thought, from which some
people suffered severely through not treat-
ing it promptly, and, making up my mind
th it I would not make the same mistake, I
started taking medicine for it.”
“Avery sensible procedure,” ejaculated
the scribe.
“It would have been had I known the
proper medicine to take, but I had had no
previous experience, so I took whatever I
saw advertised, and when one thing did me
no good I tried another, thinking that I
would sure to strike the right one in the
end. Sure enough I did, but it was not till
after enduring several years’intense torture
that a friend advised me to give a trial to
Clements Tonic, but by that time my health
was completely wrecked. The food I per-
suaded myself to take was harder to digest
than ever, and the after effects were much
more trying. A heavy pain settled on my
chest, which gave me great trouble in
getting my breath, especially at night time,
when I often had to sit up in bed, because
I felt as if I would smother if I lay there
any longer, and paroxysms of pain were
caused in my stomach through wind arising
from the decayed food. By these and other
means I was prevented from obtaining any-
thing like a requisite amount of sleep, the
consequence being that when I ought to have
been leaving my bed I was too dead tired to
do so. I got so miserably weak and low-
spirited that I felt as if I could not speak to
any ody, whilst the mere thought of doing
a little work seemed preposterous, because I
had no vitality in me to do it. For another
reason I did not like exerting myself. That
was because my heart palpitated and pained
me when I put my body in motion, and 1
grew so anxious on that score that I resolved
to take the greatest care of myself and not
throw any chances away. But at last I gob
so disheartened that I thought I would never
be well again, a sharp pain catching me
between the shoulders and across the lower
part of my back, while sometimes I could
scarcely see out of my eyes for the terrible
headaches I had. .My tongue was in a dis-
agreeable state, being almost white, aud
everything I tasted seemed bitter ; not that
I tasted much, as I had no appetite at all.
I could not have sat in a wager boat for the
life of me, as I had turns of giddiness,
which inconvenienced me even when stand-
ing on my feet. What had once been hard,
solid flesh became nearly all skin and bone,
so that there was no light task in front of
Clements Tonic when I started taking it.
Another circumstance which I should not
overlook was that I used to have very un-
pleasant dreams on any of those rare
occasions when exhausted nature claimed a
couple of hours’ sleep, so you see what a
perpetual drain there was on my system
through want of proper rest ; and nothing
could ease my pains sufficiently to allow me
to sleep, save Clements Tonic, which gave
me a new feeling of content before the first
week was out. It seemed a marvellous
thing that Clements Tonic could have such
a desirable effect upon me so qui .kly, con-
sidering that I had been suffering so long ;
and further use of that medicine showed
that all others were outclassed. The lazy
sense of drowsiness which had made my life
so dreary was given place to a feeling of
exhilaration and activity as a result of using
Clements Tonic, whilst that medicine’s
action on my nervous system was more
beneficial than I had ever deemed possible to
be obtained. My nerves became toned to the
state of perfection they were in when I
could go over a three-mile course at a ding-
dong pace ; and I have such a high opinion
of the strengthening qualities of Clements
Tonic that if I were young enough to start
racing again I would take that medicine for
the purpose of supplying the vitality which
is lost whilst training. For putting my in-
ternal organs into a healthy and machine-
like condition, and driving away headaches,
giddiness and chest pains my acknowledge
ments go to Clements Tonic, which also
claimed my gratitude for remedying the
palpitations and heart pains. With each
bottle of Clements Tonic I came nearer the
end of my afflictions, for I was eating well
and could digest all manner of food. Windy
spasms and back pains were done away
with by the same medicine, aud there was
not an ache left in me. I can frankly
admit that my liver and nerve troubles
were quite cured by Clements Tonic, and
you can publish all I have said in any way
you think advisable.”
“ Thank you,” replied our representative,
“ but it is pro' able some of your old friends
already know this experience of yours.”
“ Some do, I know; but I can’t tell all of
them, as I know so many through living in
this suburb twenty years, while for the last
five years I have been proprietor of the
Leichhardt Swimming Baths.”

Severe Attack of
Influenza
Followed by Bronchitis, which left
him weak, languid and depressed
Here la a case o! a gentleman who waa
left in a very delicate state of healtn
through a severe attack of influenza fol-
lowed by bronchitis. He lost flesh rapidly,
and became very weak, as the following
letter shows: —
“ Robert Street, Plumstead, *
“London, England,
<< nor*. Am her 2nd. 1900.
••Dear Sirs,—About six months ago I had
a severe attack of influenza followed by
bronchitis, which left me very weak, languid
and depressed. I lost two stone in weight
and was so weak that my legs used to give
way, and often had to stop and rest to gain
my breath. I tried many things but gained
no benefit. Seeing an advertisement about
Scott’s Emulsion I procured a bottle to see
what it would do for me. I soon began
MR- FRANK HOWARD-
(From a photograph.)
to feel it waa doing me good, for I felt
stronger, my appetite improved, I lost
the wretchedly depressed feeling I had
felt and became stronger and better in every
way. I continued the treatment and took
several bottles, with the result that my
health was completely re-established, and
words quite fail me to express the gratitude
I feel for all that Scott’s Emulsion has done
for me. I can with every confidence recom-
mend the preparation to anyone suffering
as I did, and remain,— Very sincerely yours,
“ (Signed) Prank Howard.”
The benefits people derive from Scott’s
Emulsion are in no way exaggerated. The
letters we publish from people who have
tested our preparation are published just
as they are written, and in each case every
effort is made to get at the exact truth.
Scott’s Emulsion will not accomplish the
impossible, of course, but that it is a standard
remedy, endorsed by all physicians, and
approved of by all who take it, is unquestion-
able.
You cannot judge of the possibilities of
cod-liver oil and hypophosphites until you
have tiied the genuine Scott’s Emulsion,
which may be distinguished by our trade
mark of a man holding a big fish over his
shoulder. Where health is at stake, it does
not pay to experiment with cheap nostrums.
You can obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion
by sending fourpenee to Scott & Bowne, Ltd.,
483 Kent-street, Sydney, and mentioning this
paper. All chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

In the Wood.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I met her in the wood,
The graceful, blushing maid.
An angel’s form before me stood,
I almost felt afraid !
I met her in the wood,
As artless as a child,
Beneath a dainty scarlet hood
Her golden hair flowed wild.
I met her in the wood—
A fragrant, shaded bower.
The dew-disked flowers about her stcod,
Who seemed herself a flower.
I met her in the wood
Beside a sparkling rill.
We would have parted, if we could,
But neither had the will.
I met her in the wood,
The dew was on the ground.
Her heart was in a happy mood,
And mine to her was bound.
I met her in the wood
Above the village mill.
I see her now as then she stood ;
How dear the vision still!
I met her in the wood,
Through which we went to school.
Her smile became my daily food,
Her- word my golden rule.
I met her in the wood.
We chatted by the hour ;
She blushed, she pleaded, she withstood
I kissed her in that bower.
I met her in the wood
For five short, happy years.
Her goodness seemed to make me good.
She saved me by her tears.
I took her to the wood,
In happy wedded life,
And where at first the lovers stood
I always kissed my wife.
I laid her in the wood,
When many years had passed.
She sleeps where once two lovers stood,
And there I’ll sleep at last.
We wander to the wood —
Her boys—now sturdy men,
Her daughters—grown to womanhood —
How like what she was then !
I totter to the wood,
Grandchildren trip before,
An 1 still, where long ago we stood,
I see her smile once more.

A Ballad of Night.
At last—at last—the tyrant sun
Has loosed his grip upon the clay ;
And like some sad and swefit-souled nun,
The Lady Moon resumes her sway.
The hour is near of gnome and fay,
And fairies that dance in her tender light.
And my hearts finds rest from its weary way,
Alone with the soul of the secret night.
I have entered a haven that all men miss
Who sail their ships on a chartless sea ;
They steer with inscient eyes, I wis,
With storm and strife for their destiny :
To an idol called Pleasure they bow the knee,
And their barques come home in a dolorous
plight.
No care have I, ’twixt sea and lea,
Alone with the soul of the secret night.
I have done with the glare and the glamor of day;
My part in the vain old chase is o’er ;
From the reefs of pain I have steered away,
In Pleasure’s ports I traffic no more—
Soft winds long since my shallop bore
To an island immured from the sun’s keen sight,
Where I dream and dream on the murmuring
shore,
Alone with the soul of the secret nigh\
Brothers ! Of Life and its fetters be free—
Forswear the sun and the glare of its light;

Last Night.
You and I at the gate together,
While the moon went under a cloud,
Stood, in the silent witching weather—
Lips were silent, but hearts beat loud.
Your eyes were bright, but your face looked proud;
I paused in a sentence half-begun—
“lf,” I asked, “ should I be allowed?”—
Just as the clocks were striking one.
In my heart I was wondering whether
All my story were best avowed,
Or had I come to the end of my tether,
Doomed to remain in the comrade-crowd?
Almost my courage was crushed and cowed,
Then I remembered l ' Faint heart ne’er won ”
go And the moment was bliss-endowed,
Just as the clocks were striking one.
When thismorn youshookoff your slumber-shroud,
Did it seem slight in the light of the sun ?
Remember your face was for blushing bowed
Just as the clocks were striking one.

This is the sort of thing that Joe Chamberlain is getting by the carlad from all over the "Empire" by cable:-"At last night's meeting of Burwood Council the Mayor moved: 'That
the Burwood Council, having heard with great satisfaction of the declaration of peace, has great pleasure in welcoming the Boer population of South Africa into the aspirations and liberties which
we as British subjects enjoy; and that this resolution be conveged to the Boer leaders through Lord Milner.’ Now that peace had been declared it should be recognised that the Boers were British
subjects, and they should sympathise with them, inasmuch as they had suffered the loss of their country."

The Fall of Peacock.
The sun of Peacock set last week. It may
rise again at any moment, for Victoria’s
futile Premier with the loud laugh goes ou.t
to make way for men less promising than
himself, but for the time Peacock is a back
number and a fallen institution. He was a
better Premier in many ways than some men
who, like Service, passed for political giants
a few years ago ; yet Peacock nowadays
ranks as only ordinary—very ordinary, in
fact. Twenty or 25 years ago it was
much easier to be a great Australian states-
man than it is now. The public debt was
about half as much per inhabitant then, and
only one-third as much in the gross ; there-
fore the Premier now has to get from each
inhabitant, without unduly angering that
inhabitant, about £2 for interest, where the
man who held the easy billet 20 or 25 years
ago had only to extract £l. The land
revenues, which are now falling very
low in some States, were large and
flourishing in those late lamented days,
and the gold production was high.
Social problems settled themselves then
to a great extent. When work was
scarce—well, there were still railways to
build that promised to yield a good return on
the expenditure, and the debt being still
comparatively small, and the interest-burden
small also, loans were floated with a light
heart to build them, and that supplied em-
ployment. Also, the unemployed could be
shunted on to the land—there was still good
land in reasonable abundance to put them
on ; and the alluvial goldfields were still rich
in spots. The old age pension hadn’t begun
to give trouble then. Taking Victoria as a
fair sample—ip,lB.6l, 60 persons out of every
10,000 had reached or exceeded the pension
age of 65 years ; in 1871 the number was 138
in each 10,000; in 1881 it was 245 ;in 1891,
345. Not so very many years ago the aged
poor could bo disposed of by casual pro-
cesses of benevolence, and a man might be a
first-class Premier without having any intel-
ligent ideas whatever on the old age pension
problem. The land boom was still in full
blast, and everybody was making money-
on paper at all events. Then, too, the work-
ing man didn’t rage very much whether he
had a vote or not. It was a pretty good world
when the loans were coming in, andthe interest
was only beginning to go out, and the great
trunk railways were being built, and the
great land sales filled the Treasury, and the
gold was still tolerably abundant ; and while
the sun shone people were content, with
occasional exceptions, to take things as they
came.
* * * *
Peacock might have been one of Aus-
tralia s greatest statesmen if he had been in
office 25 years earlier, before the large
troubles began. As it was he proved a
failure. He wobbled feebly about the pro-
posed reduction of members. The success
of the Freetrade party in the House of
Representatives in cutting down the King-
ston tariff left him with a deficient revenue,
and he couldn’t put things right by auction-
ing a lot of State lands as his predecessors of
the 70’s and 80’s used to do. He had an
unemployed trouble on his hands, and he
couldn’t find work for the unemployed bv
building a railway to Sydney or Ballarat or
Bendigo or Adelaide in the old, easy way,
for all these railways are built already. He
had to find money for old age pensions, and
help to run a shabby little war, and
try to pay off a back deficit. James
Service gained the name of being the
greatest financier Victoria ever possessed, at
a time when a State financier was troubled
with none of these woes and burdens. Pea-
cock began to be called a weak and unsatis-
factory man, and he fell over a foolish little
transaction for which there is no precedent
in this country's history. His colleagues
were also ordinary men whose troubles were
too much for them. They muddled the
administration of the Factories Act, and the
railways, and the export produce depart-
ment, and the irrigation question, and other
things. The alleged political giants of the
past built so many useless lines with loan
moneys that it is difficult to make a success
of the railway department now; and in
the days of these giants settlement hadn’t
spread out into the dry country, and there
was consequently no irrigation problem ;
also there was no exported produce depart-
ment to struggle with then, and no Factories
Act to administer. Feeling themselves
slipping, most of Peacock’s colleagues signed
their resignations and let the fact be known
to pacify the public. At the same time they
dated the resignations five months ahead to
prevent themselves losing their billets too
suddenly. When the five months expired
Peacock became officially aware of the
resignations, but refused to accept* them.
Whereupon Parliament decided, confusedly,
that it was a fool of a proceeding, and the
Peacock Government went down in a
minority of three. If Peacock had not, in
the interests of grovel, aided in the expul-
sion of one of his own supporters (Findley,
of the Tocsin) for daring to have an opinion
of his own, whereby Findley’s seat went to
a Tory, the balance might have been about
even.
• • • •
The Bulletin doesn’t admire Peacock
any more than it admires See and Jenkins ;
still it reckons that Peacock was defeated
by a set of men more hopeless than himself.
Also, it reckons that the Premiers of to-day
are, on the whole, a better lot than the old,
much-advertised crowd which included
Parkes, Robertson, Service, M'Culloch,
O’Shanassy, MTlwraith— the “men who
made the country” in other days. These
grand old men left behind them a legacy of
debt, sin, diminished assets and extravagant
traditions which make it very hard to
be a brilliant politician nowadays. They
rolled the big stone gaily down the
hill, and the men of to-day have
to sorrowfully roll it up, and the man
who rolls the stone up can’t well be such a
brilliant sprinter as the down-hill man.
Further, Peacock and his kind are as good
men as any country can expect to get at the
salary. Australia, in the matter of Minis-
terial salaries, is a servile follower of
British traditions, trying to fit them to a
wholly different set of circumstances. In
Britain, a Minister isn’t expected to live on
his salary, much less to save money out of
it for his old age. He is expected to be a
rich man, following politics for fame or as a
matter of taste and inclination. Britain can
find abundance of that class of men, and
Australia can’t. In the United Kingdom,
Mulhall estimates that nearly 80 per cent,
of the total wealth is held by 1| per cent, of
the adult population. That means that li
per cent, of the population is so rich that it
can follow politics for an amusement without
any remuneration whatever, and out of that
If per cent, there is abundance of material
from which to form unpaid Parliaments,
and Ministries whose pay, compared
tvith the claims upon them, is little
more than a matter of form. But
it is only because 98£ per cent, of the
population is poor—much of it abjectly poor
—that this rich class exists, and Australia
doesn t want to get into that condition. If
wealth was anything like evenly divided
there would hardly be one man in the United
Kingdom who could afford to sit in Parlia-
ment without sakry, or to hold office at the
present wage while keeping up the traditions
of office.
Further, a large class in Great Britain
follows politics because political success leads
to hereditary peerages, to dignified positions
as governors or viceroys, to all manner of
social and other distinctions. In Australia
it only leads to a cheap and nasty knighthood
and the bitter animosity of the Daily
Telegraph and the S.M. Herald when
their free trains threaten to be cut off.
Further, Britain is content with a Parliament
and Ministry which uphold class distinctions,
and preserve as a holy thing the land
monopoly of a few great families. Aus-
tralia, so far as concerns the land
monopoly, could get the same kind of
Parliament and the same kind of Ministry
at a similar price—the existence of the
Victorian House of 48 Rich Landlords proves
that ; but it doesn’t seek for anything of the
kind. This country isn’t content to divide
up its whole area among a few thousand
rich landlords, and let them and a number
of lawyers and wealthy business men
legislate for it, as they would gladly
do, on very moderate terms, taking
the rest of their remuneration indirectly by
looking after their own class interests. It
can’t pay its legislators partly in dukedoms
and such like gew-gaws, as Britain does. So
the obvious course is to put the matter on a
plain, business footing, and pay an adequate
price for brains. At present a successful
politician who puts in 20 years in Parliament
may hold office for, perhaps, seven years at
£l2OO a year, and be a private member for
13 years at £3OO. That means that his
average income is £615 a year, and after he
has paid his election expenses regularly, and
been tapped for donations by all the well-
meaning charities and other institutions in
his electorate; he probably averages not
much over £4OO. And he hasn’t a life billet
as a bank or insurance man of reasonable
honesty and capacity has. In nine cases out
of ten a time comes when he is thrown out
again at a general election to start the world
afresh, and most of what he has learned in
Parliament is useless outside.
* • * •
The prizes at the top are not big enough.
Australia does not want Ministries made up
of very rich men—men who were born rich
—who will legislate only for their own class.
It doesn’t want Ministries of old men like
Braddon and Fysh —men who have made
their fortunes, and who govern the country
a little to amuse themselves in their declin-
ing years, and to whom it doesn't matter
much how the country goes, because, in the
natural course of events, their time among
the ruins will bo short. It doesn’t want
mere grovellers who will regard the paltry
distinction of knighthood as a reward in
itself. It doesn’t want third-rate men, to
whom a career in which unusual success
pans out at a net average of £8 a week is
sufficient inducement because it is more than
they could hope to make anywhere else. It
certainly doesn’t want men who eke out
their salaries by cadging loans, or by lending
their names to bubble companies, or who
use their Ministerial office chiefly to promote
their private business or their private steals.
Australia has had all these men. Also it has
had one or two brilliant exceptions—able
men with clean records who devoted them-
selves to the unprofitable game from sheer
love of it and of their country ; but these
could be counted on the fingers of one hand,
and even then there would be some space to
spare.
* * • *
This country asks that young, honest,
patriotic men, with brains which would
enable them to earn, perhaps, £2OOO a
year as a regular thing in other pursuits,
will give their lives to a business whose
highest prize is about £l4OO a year for a few
precarious years —and it may take a whole
sheaf of years before even that scanty
eminence is reached. It gets Peacocks and
Jenkinses, and they are better than it
deserves at the price. It doesn’t expect to
get a good railway manager, or Chief Justice,
or the head of a big bank or insurance office
for much less than double the money, with
a life-billet thrown in ; and it has offered
seven times the price for a mere ornamental
Governor—but as regards its Ministers the
English tradition lies heavy on its soul, and
it can’t struggle out of the English groove.
And because it can't get a first-class man for
the starvation wage now offering, certain wise-
acres, calling themselves a Reform Party, pro-
pose to offe r less. The position, by reason of the
country’s load of embarrassments, wants a
vastly better man than the kind that was good
enough 20 years ago, and the country isn’t
going the right way to get that kind of man.
George Turner's financial ability probably
saved Victoria five or six millions in a very
bad time, yet the idea of offering him £5OOO
a year to retain his services, when a man
who would lose five or six millions can be
got for £l4OO, would be regarded as an out-
rage on the Constitution. So men like
Turner go, and men like Shiels stay, and
men like Peacock, who is better than
Shiels, don't care much whether they go or
stay. If a Premier wrecks the country the
most the country can do is to throw him
out of a billet which, if he has any respect-
able money-earning capacity at all, he is
probably holding at a dead loss. On these
terms he doesn’t need to care very much
whether he wrecks the country or not.
Peace at Any Price.
The British Government is to be congratulated
on having at last come to see the situation in
S’Africa almost eye-to-eye with the Sydney Anti-
War League, Professor Wood, and other people
who have lately earned the undying hatred of every
“ right-thinking ” alderman by their opposition
to a policy of Boer extermination. A few months
ago, the British policy, as announced by Lord
Ketchener, was to insist upon the absolute sur-
render of the Boer combatants ; there was to be
no parleying, no discussion of terms. By a certain
date all the Boers were to lay down their arms and
swear allegiance to the British King ; those who
did -not were to be declared outlaws, and on being
captured were to be exiled for ever from S’Africa.
This policy was justifiably described at the time
as one of “extermination,” being pursued as it
was, concurrently with a system of concentrating
the female and infant population of the Boer
country in camps, where they died at the rate of
30 per cent, per annum, and of devastating with
fire all the Boer territory. Now, farm-
burning having failed, concentration having
failed, threats of death and exile having
failed, Mr. Chamberlain (probably forced
to do violence to his own ideas by pressure from
the King) has been forced to fall back upon the
Anti-War League policy.
* * • *
It is an honorable, if an illogical sequel to two
years and more of wrong-doing, to the waste of
thousands of human lives and over £200,000,000 in
treasure. It is better to repent at the 11th hour
and to undo as far as possible the wrong of the
past than to persist to the end in evil. As matters
Btand at present, it would have been hardly
practicable for Britain to have conceded to the
broken Boer people full independence. The war
has been certainly successful m destroying the civil
government of the Boer Republics, leaving only a
loose military administration. For England to
simply step out of the country, whose law-courts
she has overthrown and whose lands she has
devastated, would be to leave the Republics in a
state of anarchy and of crushing poverty. Instead
of doing that she agrees to pay a big war in-
demnity to her enemies for the restoration of
their farms ; to exempt them from any war taxes
in the future ; to grant them self-governing rights
shortly ;to restore all prisoners; to acknowledge
the Taal language in the law-courts, and to teach
it in the schools j to exempt from death-punish-
ment the rebel allies of the enemy ; and to allow
the Boers their guns and horses. The practical
men in the ranks of the Boers oould hardly have
asked for more : England could hardlv have
granted more if John Morlky had been Premier
and W. T. Stead Colonial Minister.
• » * *
The Peace is an honorable one : honorable alike
to the great power which admits its mistake, and
to the little people which, bv indomitable courage,
has saved so much from the apparent ruin of its
fortunes. If it is administered honorably by Eng-
land—neither the terms of the agreed indemnity
nor the promised rights of self-government being
withheld—and if it is possible for the Boers to for-
get the events of the past two years, the peace
may prove as lasting as it is honorable. But any
dishonesty, or appearance of it, will inevitably
force on another struggle. The Boers, left with
their arms and horses, thoroughly trained now iu
the art of war, stronger in the point of fighting
numbers (since all prisoners are to be restored)
than at any period of the late campaign, will be
able in some respects to threaten more serious
trouble than in 1900. Indeed if one ever
imagined that the Conservative party in
England seriously believed in those gorgeous
fictions about a Boer conspiracy “to sweep
the English into the sea,” all idea of that char-
acter would be now fully dissipated by the action
of that party in putting the Boers into a position
which will enable them to carry on any such
designs with much greater hope of success than
before. But, of course, the English Conservatives
never had any such belief. The wolf drinking at
the stream with the lamb was obliged to invent
some excuse for an act of rapine, and that one,
ridiculous as it was, served best when the even
more ridiculous " Uitlanders’ grievances” pretext
was dissipated.
• • * •
Summed up, the position is this: In 1900 Eng- J
land made war upon the Transvaal Republic and
the Orange Free State ostensibly because—
(l) The Transvaal refused to give the franchise to
foreigners within its borders who were not willing to
undertake the full citizen responsibility of being called out
on commando, if necessary. That there was no objection
to allowing Englishmen or any other foreigners becoming
naturalised, if they swore the full oath of allegiance, is
shown by the fact that very many Boer citizens were
English-born (including one of the judges of the Supreme
Court of the Transvaal and many other high officials)
The Transvaal objected to give the Republic’s franchise
to people who refused to swear allegiance to the Republic.
The Uitlanders made the impudent demand that they
should be allowed to become citizens of the Republic so
far as the privileges of citizenship, but not the responsi-
bilities, were concerned. The refusal of this monstrous
request by the Transvaal Government was so clearly just
that no decent Englishman now talks with anything but
scorn of the “ Uitlanders’ grievances.”
(2) The Boers were conspiring with the Cape Colony
Dutch to sweep the English into the sea.
(England made the war, though the Boers fired
the first shot. The English Law ISociety having
put as an examination question “Were the Boers
m 1900 justified by the position of affairs in issuing
an ultimatum and proceeding to hostilities?” the
answer “ Yes ” was given by every constitutional
law authority. What really happened was that
the little man, seeing the big man getting out
of his coat to crush him, hit first.) Now after
destroying the civil government of Boerland and
devastating the Boer country, England has to
come to terms with the remnant of its fighting
men in the field; to agree to give them their lands,
their arms, and their horses; to pay for the
damage she has done to their property ; and to
administer their country on a recognition of their
language and laws, “pending the granting of self-
government.” Further, she has to do what, of all
things, is most abhorent to a sovereign power,
concede to a foe in the field a right of dictation in
regard to certain of her own subjects—the Cape
Colony rebels. It is peace, honorable peace,
humane peace, a settlement doing honor to the
final good sense of the attacking Power. But,
from the Imperial, the Jingo point of view, it is a
very poor result for the spending of £200,000,000
and the loss of some thousands of soldiers. The
Gladstone “surrender,” after Majuba Hill, is,
considering all the circumstances, quite over-
shadowed as a concession by the Chamberlain
surrender of 1902. Perhaps it is a fact that Mr.
Chamberlain has been converted back to the
views he held in the Majuba days?
• * • •
A curious fact in regard to this Peace is that it
has been enthusiastically cheered by the most
rampantly Jingo and pro-Gore partisans of a few
months back. The daily press of Australia lias,
of a sudden, ranged itself by the side of The
Bulletin to declare for peace at any reasonable
price, forgetting all about the heroics of last year,
when “the colonies demanded that there should
be removed all danger of a future Dutch war,”
.and when “ no self-respecting nation could permit
an enemy to dictate its treatment of its own
rebellious citizens.” The wealthy mob which was,
a few weeks ago, clamoring for the blood of Prof.
Wood, because he urged that England should


agree to almost exactly the term# now forming
the basis of peace, to-day acclaims this treaty as a
wiso act of statesmanship and the crowning seal
of victory I The old original pro-Gore section of
the Australian community seems to be left with
but one adherent, who writes to the Evening
News (June 4):
The sooner an Englishman paints his face black and
goes about as a nigger, the sooner he will be in his proper
place. By his securing peace in South Africa at any
price, after all his blatherskiting of what he was going
to do, and what he wasn’t going to do, he has become
lower than a blaokfellow, so the sooner he takes on the
color the better for everybody.
All the rest of Jingodom cheers a Peace for which
England pays the extreme price which any
reasonable antagonist could demand. So it is
evident that through all these weary months,
whilst The Bulletin seemed to stand alone m
condemning the policy of insisting upon absolute
surrender, followed by exile, as barbarous —the
Jingoes were actually at one with us and ready to
acolaim a treaty such as that now signed ! It is a
pity that there should have been for so long such
a curious misunderstanding. But the fault was
not in any stupidity on the part of The Bulletin.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Fodder Fake.
The eminently wise decision of the Federal
Government not to suspend the duties on im-
ported fodder moved Sydney Telegeaph to
a burst of anger which completely gave the
fake away. For it is all a fake—a desperately
mean and shabby outbreak of malice against the
Government which opposes Kanaka labor, and
refuses to continue the 50 per cent. Protection
under the postal laws to the Sydney Freetrade
newspapers. This was the Teleghaph’s snort
when the refusal came along:
The position as we understand it is that the whole
question is left to the Governments of N.S.W. and
Queensland to do or not to do, the Federal Government’s
attitude being one of impartial and inactive neutrality.
Obviously the State Governments are very awkwardly
circumstanced. The question of duties, as Mr. See re-
minded the Federal Government a day or two ago, is out
of their jurisdiction. They cannot suspend the duties.
What they can do is pay them, in which case the Federal
Government will extort its fourth and the producer in
other States continue to pouch high prices. The whole
burden of what Mr. Deakin admits is a national affliction
will then be borne, so far as the Governments can act, by
the State taxpayer in N.S.W. and Queensland, but
especially in N.S.W. It must be anything but reassuring
to those who were led to expect expansion in the ideas
and practice of government under Federation to find the
Federal Government thus declining to grapple with a
national emergency, and weakly handing that emergency
over to the State Governments to make a shift for or to
ignore. More humiliating still is the position in view of
the patent fact that the reason why the Federal Govern-
ment dare not act for itself is that it has counted noses,
and finds that a resolute policy would be unpopular in
two States where producers are looking forward. to doing
well out of the misfortunes of those who are within the
drought area.
That yarn doesn’t even read plausibly, and none
but the most utterly ignorant could be deceived
by it. There is no need for freetrade in fodder
for the benefit of distressed New South Wales
and Queensland, for they have got it already
if their Governments like to use it. If the pas-
toralists want imported fodder, and are willing to
pay for it, and there is any place outside from
which it can be procured, the See and Philp
Governments can import a million tons of fodder,
or authorise private persons to import it,
without paying a copper in duties. These
Governments, with the authority of their Parlia-
ments, can give the Federal Government their
own cheques for the duty, and at the end of the
month they will get every penny of the amount
back in the distribution of the surplus, and they
will have paid no duty at all, and the Freetrade
in fodder that they are asking for is there ready
to their hand. They can do this as long as the
book-keeping clauses of the Constitution last—
that is to say, for some years yet. The
statement that the Federal Government
“will extort its fourth” of the duty
is an absolute lie. The Federal Government has
never “extorted its fourth” of the customs revenue.
It only takes as much of the fourth as it requires,
and hands back all the rest, and it wouldn’t require
any more because N.S.W. and Queensland were
importing fodder. The statement that “the
fodder producer in other States would continue to
pouch high prices ” may be true, but still
the fact remains that N.S.W. and Queens-
land can import fodder for their own use
duty free any time they like, if only the
Philp and See Governments, which receive
the duties, will move in the matter, and if prices
remain high after that, then Freetrade must bear
the blame. The other States have offered no objec-
tion whatever to N.S.W. and Queensland using the
powers which the book-keeping system gives
them to import fodder free of all duty. But if
N.S.W. and Queensland demand that the duties,
fixed by a Parliament in which N.S.W. and
Queensland are fully represented, shall be sus-
pended, regardless of the fact that the suspension
in Tasmania and Victoria and S. A. will do N.S.W.
and Queensland no earthly good—when this de-
mand is made out of pure cussedness—they natur-
ally do object. The transparent fodder lie and fake
is being run in Queensland to discredit the Federal
anti-nigger-labor Ministry; in N.S.W. it i 3
employed to discredit the Federal Ministry which
refused to subsidise the Foreign-trade papers any
longer, and which attacked the sacred Calico
Jimmy interests; and it comes in handy as
a means to stir up the dirty waters of
inter-State jealousy. As a matter of fact there
is no real demand for fodder from outside the
Commonwealth. Maoriland has practically none
left to sell, for nearly a quarter of its cultivated
area has been abandoned since the war
started, and its harvests have diminished
enormously. Importing from America costs so
much in freight that it would be cheaper to let
sheep perish in most cases than to keep them alive
with American hay. If the Governments of Pre-
mier See and Premier Philp think differently,
they have only to announce that they will use the
power they possess, and which they will possess
so long as the book-keeping period lasts, to admit
the fodder of all the world into N.S.W. and
Queensland absolutely free, by the simple process
of the State Treasurer paying the duty to the
Federal Treasurer and getting it all back in his
surplus at the end of the month. The reason why
this isn’t advocated by the Freetrade daily
papers is that the real object is to destroy
Protection in the other States, to rouse hatred
against the Federal Government for certain
honest and democratic acts it has performed, and
to set the inter-State animosities going again with
renewed fury.

Fulsford “Submits a Calculation.”
The old, old story once more :
Senator Pulsford (N.S.W.) submitted calculations to
show that it would pay the Commonwealth handsomely
to put on the estimates £1760, representing the wages
paid to match-makers, and allow them to be idle, and
abolish the industry.
It is one of the misfortunes of this troubled coun-
try that the party which Senator Pulsford does
not decorate is always “ submitting calculations ”
like that. Nothing much more dull and sodden
ever emanated from the alleged brain of an
allegedly full-grown citizen of sound mind, yet
Pulsford and one or two of the more dried-up
members of his clan spend a great part of their
time “pointing out” how it would makethe_coun-
try richer if a few dozen or a few hundred indus-
tries were abolished, and the people employed in
them were pensioned off and instructed to loaf, all
the rest of their days. It is unfortunately possible
for a man to become so intensely logical that he
loses his intellect altogether, and to work out
arithmetical problems with such intense accur-
acy that he can’t see that there is no sense in the
answer. For instance:
(1) If two men fall down a precipice how many
precipices will six men fall down ? Answer, three.
(2) If 1000 skilled workmen can build St. Paul’s Cathe-
dral in five years, how long will it take 157,680,000,000
workmen to do it ? Answer, one second.
(3) If a country imports half of all the articles it
requires, and a 10 per cent, duty on them yields it
£2,000,000 a year customs revenue, how much customs
revenue will'it get if it gives up making anything, and
imports all the things it requires ? Answer, £4,000,000.
The third is the proposition of Pulsbord and Co.,
and it is just as silly as the first and second
propositions. But ordinary common sense has
been eaten out of the great Foreign-trade authority
by the moth of calculation, and the dry-rot of
mechanical arithmetic, and the rust of that variety
of logic which sees clearly that if a person aged
eight years is four feet high therefore a person
aged 65 will be 32£ feet high, and if a man sees
seven snakes on the 2nd day of the month he will
necessarily see 14 snakes on the 4th, while two
men will see 189 serpents on the 27th. This is
Pulsford’s case condensed:
A country requires (say) £200,000 worth of matches per
annum. It puts on a 10 per cent, duty, in consequence
of which a local industry starts and makes all these
matches—therefore the duty yields no revenue and no-
body pays it.
The local industry employs (say) 30 hands and pays
(say) £2OOO a year in wages.
If there was no local industry and all the matches were
imported, the State would get £20,000 customs revenue (it
would also pay £200,000 for foreign matches, but that
doesn’t count). ,
Therefore, if the country abolished the local industry
and pensioned the workers out of the customs revenue at
full pay it would still be £lB,OOO a year better off (the
fact that it would be £200,000 worse off through having
to pay that amount extra for imported matches is per-
sistently ignored).
No man has a right to make anything unless he can
make it more cheaply than everybody else.
The Freetrader says that the buyer pays the duty.
Therefore the Pulsford theory is that it is more profit-
able for the country to pay £200,000 a year for matches,
and to pay duty on £200,000, and to pay 30 people for
doing nothing, than not to pay any of these things.
Supposing a country has a 10 per cent, duty on every-
thing, then that country should stop work altogether,
for by making anything at all it reduces imports, and on
every £1,000,000 worth of goods it doesn’t import it loses
£lOO,OOO customs revenue.
When it made uoiLmg at all it would naturally import
everything. Therefore imports would increase enormously
(Heaven knows how they would be paid for) and this
would mean a stupendous increase of customs revenue,
which would make the country prosperous.
As, according to the solemn oath and assurance of
Pulsford, it is the buyer who pays the duty in every
case, therefore the people would be paying all this extra
customs revenue to themselves (how they would get it to
pay isn’t explained). And out of this money which they
paid to themselves, without having it to pay, they would
pension themselves off and do no work for ever after-
wards. Pulsford says this would be cheaper than
working at an industry with a 10 per cent, duty on it.
Therefore, the deadbeat in No. 1 boiler on the wharf
can make himself rich any day by buying £lOO,OOO worth
of goods (which he can’t pay for), and charging himself
£lO,OOO (which he hasn’t got) as duty on them, said
amount payable by himself to himself, and he can retire
on the proceeds. The stone-broke individual and the
stone-broke community are on the same basis in this
matter.
These are the things that Pulsford is always
“submitting calculations” to prove, and if he
would only do it in a cheerful strain, as the
present writer has endeavored to do, instead of in
nis own lugubrious fashion, his “calculations”
would be rather interesting.

The Disastrous Aunroval of the Daily
Press.
Almost the only point on which both the Sydney
morning papers cordially supported the Barton
Government at the same time was over its pro-
?osal to borrow money. On this point Sydney
elegraph spoke last Friday :
That the Commonwealth should at such an early stage
of its existence have to enter the money market in quest
of a loan is a fact not to be regarded without a certain
amount of regret. And more especially as the money is
not for investment in development works of a reproduc-
tive character. But the transferred debts which it has
on its hands can be covered in no other way, and as long
as the loan is applied strictly to this purpose it will re-
move in one direction from the State taxpayers a burden
approximately equal to that which they will have to bear
in another. On this understanding the issue of the loan
which Parliament is now asked to authorise can be sanc-
tioned without any misgiving.
And again—same paper and same issue:—
The Federal Government is now moving in the matter
of the loan bill. It is perhaps a pity that the Common-
wealth cannot keep clear of debt; and that telegraphs
and telephones cannot be constructed and Custom-houses
cannot be completed out of revenue, as they are in Eng-
land. But it has to be admitted that the revenue will not
run to it.
Then the 9.M. Herald spoke softly and gently
on the same subject:—
Yet, this being admitted, there is a case for the
Treasurer and the Ministry in seeking sanction for a loan.
Had the Post Office, for example, remained in State
control, there are improvements which would have been
defrayed by the Governments concerned. These are the
works contemplated in the schedule we give in the
“Commonwealth Notes” this morning. In the Budget
speech there was mention of another item to be charged
to loan expenditure—the cost of rifles for the defence
forces. Providing, that a due distinction is drawn
between items that'can be charged to revenue and those
that ought to be charged to loan account, it will be ap-
parent that the Commonwealth must be to some extent a
borrower. Even if revenue left a surplus available for
some of the items of permanent expenditure, public
opinion would soon bring pressure upon the Parliament
to reduce revenue by remitting taxation, or to spend
more and more liberally. Money will be needed for new
buildings and the maintenance of existing ones, and for
services of a like nature which public financiers do not
regard as chargeable to revenue. The Federal Govern-
ment has done well to make the amount moderate and to
raise it locally. Since there must be a process of securing
money for necessary public works in the several States,
we must accept the situation.
Same story in each case. This is a great rich
country of vast natural resources, and it is so
poor that “ the revenue won’t run to it,” and even
the “maintenance of buildings” and other patches
and repairs of a like nature must be done with
borrowed money. We are a grand sample of the
sturdy and self-reliant British race, and we can’t
be expected to depend on ourselves and pay our
way as Danes and Belgians and- Prussians and
Scandinavians, and similar races, may do. Also,
it isn’t worth while trying to do better, for if the
Government attempted a policy of self-reliance it
would speedily bo borne down by the popular
clamour for tFie money to be applied instead in
reduction of taxes. But it is the Hehald and
Telegraph which teach the people to demand
these constant reductions of taxation which make
loans unavoidable. They have sooled on the
Freetrade members to insist on the abolition of
dozens of items in the tariff, regardless of revenue.
In the interests of Calico Jimmy, who wants
customs taxation abolished, they pound away
at the false gospel of self-pity, and teach the
lightly-taxed Australian to weep at his alleged
dreadful condition as a persecuted and over-laden
wretch, bowed down, like Isacchar, the Strong
Ass, between two burdens. They have even got
so far as to talk of items “ that ought to be charged
to loans ’’—items that it is really wrong and sinful
not to run in debt for. The influences which are
sapping the manhood of Australia are the daily
papers, which teach the people to be lazy and in-
flated with their tale about the boundless resources
of Australia, and in the same breath teach them
to be very sorry for themselves as a poor miserable
race, which nobody can fairly or reasonably ask
to be strong and self-reliant or honest—which
can only sit down and weep over burdens
which other nations carry without turning a hair.
Of course if the Federal Government proposed to
pay its way out of revenue there would be a tear-
ful clamor for loans and a reduction of taxes.
The daily press would create that clamor and keep
it up. A country is, to a great extent, _what its
newspapers make it, and pitiable cowardice is the
keynote of Australian daily journalism.
Concerning a Lawless Profession.
The duty has become imperative on the Supreme
Court of New South Wales to deal, and to deal
drastically, with its “officers” who follow the
profession of solicitors, in a mass—not merely one
by one, as instances of more than ordinarily ram-
pant roguery come to light. _ The Supreme Court
occupies this position, that it licenses solicitors to
be its officers after professing to thoroughly test
their skill and honesty, and it provides very serious
penalties for anyone, not so licensed, who attempts
to enter into competition with those solicitors in
the performance of any legal work. _ If a member
of the public wishes to transact business with the
Court he may not employ anyone but a solicitor.
He may not interview a barrister for advice unless
through the mediary of a solicitor, and if he strives
todonisown legal business he is generally told
that he is a fool and as good as ordered to seek the
help of one of the licensed lawyers. Such being
the case, the Supreme Court bears a very heavy
responsibility in regard to those people to
whom it gives a close monopoly of its
work. Yet it i 8 a matter of common know-
ledge that the legal profession is honey-
combed with dishonesty, roguery, and criminal
conspiracy against justice. Now and again some
especially glaring offender is brought before the
Supreme Court by an aggrieved suitor —sometimes
punished, sometimes, when he is an influential
person, subjected either to no penalty or to a
B malty singularly inadequate to his misdeeds.
ut the great majority of delinquents suffer no ill
consequences at all of their dishonesty. Any
citizen of Sydney, with a fair knowledge of its
life, could tell of, not one but many solicitors
whom no sane man would trust with a loose
shilling; who have attached to their offices a small
army of false swearers, of pimps prepared to spirit
away a witness or “approach” a juryman ; who
are capable of almost any roguery, and who yet
go u.il'-.buked, unpunished, growing fat on the
proceeds of perjuries and robberies of clients.
It is intolerable that such a state of affairs
threatening the property, the liberty, and even
the life of many a citizen —should be allowed to
exist in a civilised community ; that to approach
the Temple of Justice it is necessary for the
citizen to run the gauntlet of a crowd of
men whose general character threatens his repu-
tation and even his liberty, and from among
whom he can only, by extreme good luck, secure a
tlioroughly honest and reliable guide. The
Supreme Court should either change its methods,
so that a solicitor is hot essential to a litigant, or
else should take prompt steps to thoroughly purge
the legal profession of the dangerous individuals
who now threaten the safety of the public under
the aegis of justice—even though that should
necessitate reduoing the ranks of solicitors by
haif 1
“E” writes from Melbourne:—
Any Melbourne man who strolled along Bourke-st., E.,
on the evening following the impudent robbery of Kiss s
shop must have been struck by the notion that “the
scene of the outrage ” is practically under criminal con-
trol. Never a policeman was to be seen on either side of
the street thereabouts, whilst little knots of wicked-
looking loafers stood about the kerb and grinned cun-
ningly at any passing stranger who cared to look their
wav. One felt instinctively that these young birds of
prey were the admiring pals of the fellows who took pos-
session of Kiss’s shop on the previous night, even if they
didn’t include the actual robbers. The window of the
shop, by the way, was half covered with an advt. bill that
gave manifest delight to the masters of the situation—
“ Great Robberv Sale ! Stock must be cleared—Enormous
Sacrifices.” They seemed to be watching the effect of
that bill upon casual pedestrians just as though they had
pasted it on the window themselves for a joke.
The wonder to me was not that one little
jeweller’s shop had been raided with impunity, but
that the night-birds were not game to go through
every other shop in the district, at any hour in the night
after 8 o’clock, barring only the time when the Princess s
Theatre discharges its audience. This dangerous state
of things in a principal thoroughfare, right in the heart
of Melbourne, is due not so much to the numerical weak-
ness of the police force as to the rotten system which
permits the danger to exist. The lurking cursing,
spitting wrong ’uns of society enjoy a privilege denied to
decent citizens. Law-abiding, decent-looking persons
are peremptorily moved on by a constable if they obstruct
the kerbstone in, say, Swanston-st., any time of the day,
whereas the Bourke-st, pests of society, holding their
acquaintances—the police—in terror of them, are at
liberty to line the footpath from 9 a.m. till midnight on
the look out for “ mugs.” Immunity from hustling has
made them what they are to a certain extent. They are
the dangerous creatures of disgraceful circumstances.
They breed contempt for the law and sympathy with
blackguardism in the minds of boys who are coming on.
Half-a-dozen big Irish policemen, “spoiling for a fight,
and armed with instructions to treat these vigilant kerb-
stone loafers as criminals, would be a real boon to Mel-
bourne ; but a spineless Police Department fears to
attempt any innovation which would annoy the criminal
classes.
The new Victorian Ministry is made up of Irvine
(Premier and Attorney-General), Shiels (Trea-
surer) J. M. Davies, M.L.O. (Solicitor-General),
M'Kenzie (Lands), “ Jack” Murray, of Warr-
nambool (Chief Secretary and Education), Bent
(Railways), E. H. Cameron (Mines), Taverner
(Agriculture), Robert Reid, M.L.C. (Public
Works), Kirton and M'Leod (Honorary Minis-
ters with no definite job). There is some
moderately good material dotted about this
Cabinet, but unless the dry-as-dust Irvine
develops some unexpected capacity for leader-
ship little good will come of it. The best
Ministry on earth, led by the man that
Irvine looks like, would do very little. Peacock,
whom Irvine had just cast out as a person unfit
to hold office, was invited to coalesce with Irvine
on practically equal terms, but refused. It is a
curious thing that in this time of Kyabram pro-
grammes and howls for retrenchment, Irvine, the
economist, starts with nine salaried Ministers,
whereas Peacock has lately crowded through with
eight. (The gang of thieves who robbed the State
of over £200,000 oy repudiating their water debt
demand a reduction of the paid members of the
Cabinet to five). Irvine and co. propose cutting
down the dimensions of both Houses, but whether
they will attempt anything beyond this purely
mechanical reform is doubtful. The deeply Tory
aspect of some sections of the Cabinet doesn’t
inspire much hope.

“Veteran”: Home-Minister Lyne, re naval and
military retrenchment:
It seems to me that it is but a toy naval business all
through. If we are going to have anything in the shape
of naval training it should be thorough, not make-believe.
We are now maintaining a lot of toy boats, &c.
Well, there are other toys that may not cost quite
as much as the boats, but are quite as useless.
There istheoutrageously-inflated staff, for instance,
made up of colonels, above whom Hctton,
the Commander-in-Chief, is only one step
in rank. There are the toy field-batteries,
the toy cavalry, the toy fortifications (any
of which could be rushed by a company of
marines), and the toy submarine mines. Most of
the plant, too, is only fit for the scrap-heap ; and
the instruction given, if not obsolete, is derived
from the S’African experience of a certain—well,
very unlucky—colonel. The intention, apparently,
is to begin the retrenchment from the bottom—to
reduce the numbers and pay of the lower ranks,
bring the regiments down to skeletons, and leave
untouched the well-paid colonels and majors, and
the cumbrous inefficient staff, general or district.
The staff is, in fact, the “ barracks-push ” socially,
and is therefore politically influential. Then
there are the political warriors. Who dares touch
the plumage, for instance, of Senator Lieutenant-
Colonel Neild, or Senator Colonel Cameron?
General Hutton bows, and passes them by.

Item from Sydney Telegraph of 4th May
As was, perhaps, to have been anticipated, while N.S.
Wales and Queensland have signified their desire for the
temporary suspension of the fodder duties, Tasmania and
South Australia, which have fodder to sell, have opposed
through their Premiers any such action by the Federal
Government. Meanwhile, Mr. Deakin is undecided, and
the duties remain on. Maoriland could _ doubtless
supply us with hay and chaff, but the quantities of oats
or maize she has for disposal are probably limited, and we
may be fairly certain that, if the duties were removed
FROM SUCH GRAIN, Maoriland PRICES WOULD ADVANCE.
The Railway Commissioners have, happily, made great con-
cessions on the cost of conveying fodder up country, and
if the State Governments could see their way even to
carrying it free for a time, the advantage would all be to
the owners of starving stock. Possibly it would aid
them as much as, or more than, the removal of the
duties.
Another item —same paper, same date :
If the fodder duties are suspended it will apply to all
parts of the Commonwealth alike. The objecting States
will not be asked to pay taxes from which the others are
exempt, hence the only ground of State right on which a
complaint could be founded disappears. It may be quite
true that some sections of their people have an interest
in the duties being kept on, so that famine prices may be
extorted for the food of starving stock in Queensland and
New South Wales.
When a paper states in the same issue (1) that
taking off the duties will, quite probably, leave
prices where they were and only deprive the
Government of revenue j and (2) that it will do
the exact reverse, it is time that paper’s sanity
was inquired into.

The plaint of Percy Maltby:
Cohen— humph !—Adelaide’s newly-elected Mayor, h; s
brought himself under the disapproval of Polict-
Magistrate Gordon by dealing “ on his own,” and with*
out the publicity of court proceedings, with severrl
informations laid by the Inspector under the Weigh 8
and Measures Act against certain metropolitan store-
keepers for using false weights. Presumably it is the
same old story. When the protection of the public is
left in the hands of the municipal authorities in such
matters, it is utterly neglected or rendered a perfect
farce by the hush-it-up that follows whenever the
inspector sheets a case home. Even the inspectors, if
they value their billets, dare not show too much zeal.
The Holy City is a Paradise at the present time for
“ sharp ” dealers. The Food and Drugs Act has been a
dead letter for years, and the local grocers have a free
hand to fire sand into their sugar without the remotest
fear of consequences. Also the Trade Marks Act, while
making it punishable to sell any tin or packet whose
contents fall short of the quantity stated on the label,
with sardonic humor, neglects to provide that such notice
shall appear l So the vendor avoids making any state-
ment whatever on the label, and simply allows hi 3
customer to assume that the contents are J, £, or lib., as
the case may be. So a 21b. tin of jam often contains 20
to 240 z., lib. packet of tea 130 z., and Jib. tins of baking
powder, pepper, etc., 30z., and so on. And the shop-
keeper votes for John Darling and deprecates “ restrictive
legislation.”
The following is just about the situation as
between the pastoral class and the rest of the
nation as things stand at present:
(1) The pastoral class, where it holds its land from the
State, demands, in many cases, that the bargain it made
with the State shall be altered for its benefit by a reduc-
tion of its rent. .
(2) It demands that fodder shall be carried free, or at a
purely nominal figure, over the State railways for its
(3) It thus demands to be coddled and subsidised and
pauperised, largely at the expense of the working-classes,
of which it has been the most consistently arrogant de-
nouncer. Also, it still denounces them—while holding
out its hat to them. , , .
(4) It is mostly a Freetrade party, and, while demand-
ing to be aided and subsidised itself, largely at the expense
of the artisan class, its newspaper organs consistently
vituperate when the artisan class asks that its industries
shall be aided by a Protective tariff, or by bonuses, or
otherwise.
(5) Its representatives—notably, the Pastoralists Re-
view man—are savagely opposed to State railways, on
the ground that they don’t pay, and the pastoral class
demands that the State railways shall be made still more
unpayable bv being used to serve its purposes gratis—by
being burdened with the pastoral class as a great unani-
mous deadhead. When they become still more unpayable
through being thus burdened the Pastoralists’ Review
will doubtless revile them something extra for not paying.
(6) In short, the Labor class finds that the party which
has constantly declared that it shouldn’t have the fran-
chise, that it shouldn’t have Parliamentary representa-
tion, that it shouldn’t have Factory legislation, that it
shouldn’t have Protection—the party which declares
itself to represent the “ natural ” industry of the country,
and says that industries should stand on their own merits
—the party which denounces State railways as a miser-
able socialistic fallacy—is now demanding, largely at its
expense, about the biggest measure of State relief on
record. And it has a well-grounded conviction that that
party won’t show any sign of gratitude after getting it,
and that it will be as angry and as arrogant as before
when anybody else’s industry asks for assistance, and
will brag about itself as a great self-supporting industry
in just the same old way.
On the subject of the N.Q. aborigines, a Burko-
town citizen makes some startling statements
(here necessarily much Bowdlerized) to The
Bulletin :
Why does the Protector of Northern Aborigines reside
in the Southern part, of the State? While travelling
through North and West one looks in vain for some
evidence of the great interest taken by the authorities
in the welfare of the aborigines. If making a collection
of weapons and other articles used by them is proof of
interest in their welfare, or removing them from the dis-
tricts to which they have been attached is valuable work
on their behalf, then our system has done valuable work.
Some aborigines and half-castes, who have good homes
and kind treatment with white families, are scared away
by being made to sign papers which are a source of mys-

tery and terror to them, and in any case a farce. Any
agreement made should be between the employer and the
° n behalf of the aborigine, who need know nothing
b° nd ? which he cannot understand and which can-
not be binding on him. It is well-known, and has been
more than once reported, that half-caste children are, at
the present day, often kept in the camps, fattened up,
and killed and eaten, but apparently no notice is taken of
tins tact. It is well known, and has been reported to the
present Home Sec. that sick blacks and half-castes who
U - . help , and treatment at Normanton hospital,
w lieh is in receipt of State aid, are treated worse than
sick animals would be. There is one well-known instance
where avery intelligent gin, who for years lived with a
uoi t. official and bore him children, was abandoned by
him and allowed to die in the gutter like a dog, although
he was in receipt of Government money. An aboriginal
stockman, who for some time worked on a station not far
from here, was thrown from his horse, and was allowed
to linger wi th a broken skull for one or two days without
medical aid. The only inquiry into the case after his
death was made by the very man who employed him. A
wealthy squatter, who occasionally visited a Northern
town, boasted openly of how he used to ride down
a mob of blacks, and outrage one of the women,
borne of these facts were reported to the authorities,
but no inquirj' was made or action taken. Is it
evT p J eaaar 'k jaunts in a steamer along the coast that
tne Home Sec. shows his interest in and desire to help the
inland tribes? Or is it by removing a few to special
reserves or strange hunting-grounds ? Is it by trying to
make a childlike aboriginal understand a legal agreement,
which generally terrifies him into running away from a
Kind employer, that we are going to protect him ? Would
it not be better to visit the camps periodically to remove
and treat the diseased, to treat them kindly and gain
their confidence, to make all half-caste children wards of
"a. ,?’ a l* d teach them housework or some handi-
craft? Would it not be better to place the blacks in each
district under the surveillance of the local medical officer
and require him to report periodically on the number and
condition of blacks in the local camps or in the employ of
whites in the towns and neigbouring stations; to insist on
some payment being made to the State on their behalf
and to make every employer furnish a return and sign an
agreement with the State, and not with the ignorant
black, undertaking to fulfil certain conditions regarding
every black employed ? “

“A Woman’s Sin,” Miss Williamsons
version of “The Manxman,” at Sydney Cri-
terion, is very long and very sombre. In a
book, the character of the heroine may be
an interesting psychological study, because
the novelist can step in now and then and
explain that erratic female. On the Criterion
stage, however, Kate Creegan is merely an im-
possible lady with a bad habit of confessing her
sins when that confession can only do harm all
round. The woman who needlessly makes a man
wretched by putting her naked sin in front of him
is an untidy female, who, if she loved a man,
would straightway put a shovelful of mud m his
best hat.
• * • *
Miss Williamson acts well enough as the
erratic wife who leaves another man’s baby with
her husband to console him for the desertion. Her
voice is occasionally hard and discordant, but
when she leaves off moaning in a high key, and
repents in the lower register, her tones are well-
modulated and pleasant to the ear. Alf. Woods
overdoes the foolishness of Peter in Act 11.,.
where the humor supposed to be connected with
some mutton chops is too long dragged-out. The
drama badly wants a regular comedian. Miss
May Hesford, as the stout servant-maid who
addresses her mistress by her Christian name (this
seems to be the custom in Man), is a lady that
improves upon acquaintance; but one wants a
giddier servant-girl to relieve the gloom of the
Quilliam household. George Cross is too mono-
tonously dolorous as Philip Christian. He moans
so obviously whenever Peter tells him what a true
friend he is, that even that not very intellectual
personage must see that something is gnawing at
Philip. Philip doesn’t even rise, as Peter does, to
the thin disguise of posting a letter to himself to
disguise nis feelings.
** m #
Considering how much misery is heaped
on the head of Pete, his career is to be very short;
he only enjoys his woe till Friday night. On
Saturday “Barabbas” is to be staged at the
Criterion, and The Bulletin trusts that the co.
will deal tenderly with the man “ who was a
Robber.” There is no positive record that Barab-
bas ever stole anything—ever floated a wild-
cat mine—ever engineered a Boer war in order
to promote the cat business and to paint
Africa red. He never proposed stealing a
whole continent from the Cape to Cairo, ana he
didn’t come back from anywhere dressed in kharki
and loaded with loot. The Robbers of old Judea
were a turbulent crowd of patriots, but they don’t
appear to have been nearly so dishonest as the
name implies, and many of them perished glori-
ously in defence of their country—not in trying to
take some one else’s country,— butchering the
Romans to the last, and selling their helmets to
the marine store. Barabbas wasn’t buried on the
Matoppo Hills, or in Westminster Abbey, but
there is no evidence to show that worse people
haven’t been planted in both places.

“ Sweet Nell of Old Drury ” commences on
Saturday, at Sydney Royal, with Nellie Stewart
as the, attraction. Nellie will play her namesake,
the orange-girl of Drury Lane, and nothing else
matters much. No other name appears in the
advertisement. Some estimable individual will
appear as Charles 11., and some highly respectable
citizen -will be Judge Jeffreys, and other persons
whom, no doubt, it is a pleasure to know will be
the other people, but these are side-issues. The
play is intended to be a blaze of glory for Nellie
btewart, and, from all accounts of her success in
Melbourne and elsewhere, the lady will blaze like
a kerosened house with too much insurance on it.
A good while has passed since Sydney saw the
old-time favorite to whom its heart has ever been
true, and when Musgrove’s advertisement says
that her return will be “the Greatest Historical
mid Most Conspicuous and Notable Dramatic
■kvent in the Annals of the City,” or something to
that effect, it doesn’t propose to dispute the state-
ment. Nellie Stewart is always a notable event,
and an annal, and many other things.
** * *
The bright farce at Sydney Palace, arising
out of the extraordinary prevalence of John Smith
in the Liiglish-speaking world, still continues to
amuse big audiences, and to impress upon the
Smiths of the community the desirableness of call-
mg their next infant Chrysostom or Sardanapalus
or Ichabod. It is hardly likely that the flat of
Mr. Sardanapalus Smith would be mistakenly
invaded by the wife of another Sardanapalus
Smith. The Test Match ” also raises a hearty
laugh, and when “ a great change of programme ”
ol the fashion familiar to variety companies is
intended, Mr. Thornton can just transpose the
names of the pieces, for there is no more (or less)
reason why one should be “The Test Match”
than the other “Facing the Music.”
*# * *
In London Town ” has begun its second
week at Sydney Lyceum, where Bland Holt, as a
sailor-man, and Mrs. 8., as a joyous pickle-
factory girl go far to redeem the inanities of Alice
and the uninteresting wickedness of the lady that
usurps her place. Sydney has taken kindly to
Bland in the rolling gait of a son of the sea, and
it feels more sympathy when the pickle-girl gets
the unjust “chuck ” from her factory than at all
the multitudinous sorrows of the unreal and ever-
wandering Alice. By the way, the person who
circulates round the stage with her back to the
audience, pretending to be Alice when that lady
has to sing “ Asthore,” is a pretty good imitation,
yet her back view doesn’t resemble Alice’s back
view quite as much as it should do.
** * *
After hearing Dolores sing the Echo Song
at her last concert Sydney (or as much of it as was
m the Town Hall, which was all that could get
there,) would cheerfully have subscribed for a’gold
wire-fence, very fine meshed and roofed, to keep
the sweet-voiced Frenchwoman in this State.
loscas Prayer” and the “ Air of the Infanta,”
from ‘The Cid,” were other gems in the pro-
gramme, which must have run to 18 numbers—all
Dolores. Mdlle. has now gone to Brisbane, and
after singing through the droughty towns of
Queensland will echo back to Melbourne, and
thence on to warble in Perth, and perhaps the
goldfields.

The net-ball game continues to be about
the most exciting item at Sydney Tivoli, and
is keen “barracking” nightly for “Vie.”
and “ Nousouth ” ; gentlemen in the gallery bar-
rack for ‘ Vic.” largely on the ground that there
is fair hope of getting up a fight to cheer the way
home by doing so. Murphy and Mack, new-
comers on Monday night, brought on the stage
much violent red hair and much violent Irish
humor. Their sketch is well enough done in its
hbeUous way; but the late-lamented Callahan
and Mack have spoiled Sydney’s appetite for
many months for “Irish low-comedy.”
** * *
4j At Melb. Princess’s the demand for
“Thirty Thieves” has improved, rather than
otherwise, everywhere except in the d.c. Mel-
bourne wants a gaudy musical spectacle at any
time, and the present demoralisation of the police-
force has given a special local interest to the title
of Musgrove’s show. Besides, the people chiefly
concerned in pushing it along have not been seen
in better parts, which is a point in their favor
There is much virtue in the first appearances of
capable performers. They are not handicapped
by unfavorable comparisons with their previous
selves. For instance, if Charles Lauri were cousin
George his work m “Thirty Thieves” would be
merely the familiar tricks and manners of a come-
dian who had been often seen under more
humorous conditions.
* * * *
Charles Lauri is a sprightly toiler, with
highly demonstrative legs, and he merits all the
success he achieved in this instance; nevertheless
he can put much of it down to his newness. In a
more amusing character, he would have scored
more heavily at his first attempt. In the same
character, he would be less appreciated at the end
of a long engagement. And, as this remark
applies to everybody else, it may be as well to
warn J. C. Piddoek, the important baritone
against the danger of going too slow in his ballad
singing. Piddoek is a good baritone and an
artistic vocalist, but his song of love drags
somewhat. Given a solo, and the whole
of the stage to sing it in, comic-opera artists,
SSL * rnl ?’ seo ™ very indisposed to hurry up,
Wallace Browijlow s tuneful references to Dolores
and the shade of the shelt’ring palms” used to
pall awfully upon the present scribe. The linked
sweetness was too long drawn out. Charles Rylev
of yore gave “ Tommy Atkins ” as though it was
a funeral march. Kennmgham travels at about
two-thirds of the pace of an ordinary concert
tenor, and the long, labored warble of May
Beatty, in The Thieves ” aforesaid, reminds one
that she is going about it after the manner of
Carrie Moore. Unfortunately, the conductors
encourage the tedious balladists by accepting an
encore for them on the least provocation. A wire-
drawn song suits the conductor, especially after
ten o’clock. If you watch the back of his head
you can almost see him dozing between the beats
of his baton.

“Much Ado About Nothing,” as they
played it at Her Majesty’s, was a shocking in-
justice to the late author. Scenes that ought to have
been included were left out, and others that ought
to have been far apart were jammed into one. The
staging was not too gorgeous, the company didn’t
fit the characters, and the audience amounted to
little more than a pelican in the wilderness. There
were four dismal nights of “Much Ado,” followed
for no conceivable reason by one night each of
“Ingomar,” and “Lady of Lyons,” stilted old
plays in which Miss Waldorf and Norval Mac-
gregor couldn’t possibly atone for their previous
mistakes. Last night (Wednesday) “Twelfth
Night” was to be revived for once, and to-night
Miss Waldorf takes a benefit in five different
characters. All the time that Her Majesty’s
was getting nearer and nearer to absolute
emptiness the management might have played
“Twelfth Night” to improving business.
“Twelfth Night” is the one production
of the season that displays every member of
the co. to more advantage than in any of
the other pieces. The management, having
struck this artistic reef by accident, ceased
operations before the public had time to recover
from the shock of the strange news and apply for
tickets in the mine. Then, when it might have
gone back to “Twelfth Night,” instead of
“starring” Miss Waldorf in some more characters
forthe edification of bare benches, the management
preferred to ignore the promptings of a singularly
unanimous press, just as though experts who look
on at the game don’t know more about the run of
things than people who live in the little theatrical
world. Judging from theadvt., there would have
been not even a one-night revival of “ Twelfth
Night, ’’ but for Lord Hopetoun, Gov. Clarke and
co. having commanded, or desired, or besought
the pleasure of Toby Atholwood in an advanced
stage of pickled herrings (p-plagueon ’em !) not to
mention Aguecheek and other memorable items.
Their Royal Excellencies evidently knew what
was good m the melancbolv season’s record.
** # *
On Saturday the Uuimc opera co. returns
to Her Majesty’s with the laudable intention of
staying there through the winter. Miss Grace
Palotta, who had a farewell night in Melbourne
before she went to Sydney, is under contract to
resume her final appearances for another few
nights, and Melbourne feels glad that her other
farewell was a false alarm. The new season is to
start in a blaze of popular revivals. “ Dorothy ”
will have the stage for a week at least, and then
“Florodora” will enable Her Grace of Palotta
to cut her prettiest figure for the positively last
time.

Nelson gathers up his honored memory
and departs from Melbourne Royal this week,
to make room for the “King of Crime.”
The “King” is an honorable shriek wherein
two large, bony hands come out from behind
a curtain at midnight, and close round the
throat of the informer (who, having been
warned that his death is fixed for about
that hour, is very foolish to sit with his
back to a curtain) and obliterate him. It is an
old-fashioned creep, with mysterious doors in it,
and a “gang ” and a cellar where horrors are pre-
pared. Albert Marsh once made it look almost
probable in Sydney, but it has never looked
really probable since.

The last nights of various people, and the
first nights of various other people—notably Mr.
and Mrs. Sydney Drew—are announced at Melb.
Opera House. The same sort of thing is happen-
ing at the Bijou, and both variety shows are in
reasonably good health at time of writing.
** * *
At Adelaide Royal, the Broughs, after pre-
senting four new pieces (all well received, bub
“ The Tyranny of Tears ” perhaps the most enthu-
siastically), have been running through the old
favorites, giving two or three nights to each. The
small, but highly-critical, local theatre-going pub-
lie, always intensely loyal to this company, has
been doing its best to see everything once again
ere saying a last good-bye to its Broughs. Janet
Waldorf opens this Saturday evening in “Twelfth
Night. ’ The Tivoli has put in a week of variety,
headed by Anglo, the juggler. However, on
Birthday Cup night, “The Wrong Mr. Wright”
took possession, and easily packed the small
theatre to the doors.
The Wild Cat Column.
Among the various things that are going to
happen next year a Federal Banking Act is promised.
So far, there is no information as to the proposed basis of
the Act, but there is a glaring necessity that it should be
something more than a mere Banking Act—the necessity
of doing something to relieve the country of its vast load
of foreign liabilities should also be kept in view In
Canada, many years ago, a law came into existence
whereby the. banks were compelled to hold at least
40 per cent, of their cash reserves in Government
notes. Experience has shown that the proportion might
have been made 50 percent, without damage, for the
banks do hold 50 per cent. This proceeding did no
injury to the banks—none of the dreadful results which
certain miserably inefficient bank potentates see ahead
came to pass, and it gave the Dominion Govern-
ment the use of a very large sum permanently and with-
out interest. Also, it gave it a small regular income in
addition through lost or accidentally-destroyed notes. And
it did not destroy the bank’sprivate note issues. What the
Dominion did with the money thus raised, present writer
doesn’t know, but if it made a foolish use of it, that is no
reason why Australia should. Such a law, if applied in
the Commonwealth on a 50 per cent, basis, would give
the Federal Government the use of about £lO,OOO 000 It
would replace the £20,000,000 of gold which now’lies
permanently idle and unproductive in the banks’ coffers
as security for their deposits and other liabilities with
£10,000,000 of gold and £10,000,000 of Government paper
which latter would lie idle there quite as gracefully and
usefully as the gold does.
Then let it be supposed that the Federal
Government took over the State debts and made the full
amount of interest and management expenses payable on
them at the date when they were taken over a peTmaneut
charge on the revenue, all amounts saved to go in reduc-
tion of the debts till they are wholly paid off. It mie-ht
devote the £10,000,000 raised by the above process to
paying off, as far as it would go, the foreign debts as they
fell due. That would reduce the outgoings for interest
by £4oo,oooa.year, and that amount could be applied to pay
off more debts. The amount saved would grow larger every
year—the old foreign debt would presently, without the
slightest additional charge upon the taxpayer, begin to
be paid off at the rate of £500,000 a year, then £600,000
£700,000 and so on. Allowing for the savings that m'ight
be effected by consolidation and conversion of the debts
50 or 60 years might see a final wiping out of the
£200,000,000 now owing by the Federal States—without
any extra taxation being levied for the purpose. Or, if it
was considered advisable to afford some relief to the tax-
payers, one quarter of the amount saved in interest as
compared with the amount payable when the debts
were taken over by the Commonwealth, might be
used as revenue, and the other three-quarters applied in
reduction of the debt. This would reduce the debt and
reduce the public burdens at the same time. Against the
Canadian experience, which proves this Idea to be prae-
ticable, there is mainly a bald assertion of its impractica-
bility by certain bank authorities who steered their
institutions so successfully on to the rocks in ’93, and
showed such an utter inability to see even a yard in front
of them when the great smash was looming, that their
word should hardly be taken as a dead sure authority on
the financial management of a fruit-barrow.

Increase .. £318,462 £645,603 £327,146
If the revenue from the resumed area is included, of
course, things look better. But The Bulletin’s eonten-
at il shouldn ’t be included is borne out by the
Auditor-General, who speaks about the Great Fake in
these uncompromising terms “ The Treasurer has car-
ried the whole of the collections to the credit of the
revenue account, but in the circumstances the}' were
obviously not available for general purposes, and the fact
should have been notified in some way on the face of the
account. The more correct course, however, would s-em
, t0 m have opened a separate account for the Sydney
Harbor Trust.” Giving the N.S.W. Government, how-
ever, the full benefit of this disreputable political swindle,
and taking its own figures, affairs are as follows

Even this is not all. In addition to the ordinary
revenue and expenses, there are large sums paid
but not included in above expenditure. Some of these are
merely advances and will be recovered later on Others
are actual expenditure, which will be adjusted when it is
convenient, or when the Treasurer is rested. During the
11 months £434,314 has been recovered from previous
advances, while £619,731 has gone out without being
charged. This makes an additional deficit of £lB5 417
On a true Cash Basis the deficit is £396,517 if the rents of
unpaid-for properties in the Resumed Area of Sydney are
regarded as revenue. If they are treated'as trust
which they should be, the shortage is
£645,755. And there is only one month to make
this huge deficit good. Of course a good deal can
be done in June. A very large sum, which has to
be paid over to the banks about the 15th, as interest
on the public debt is not put into the expenditure
account till July—which is next financial year. This was
G. H. Reid’s puerile and cheeky political dodge when
he reformed” things—the accounts tell a lie, and
describe money that has been paid away as being actually
on hand. Also a good deal can be saved in June by
leaving accounts unpaid till July. But, with all these
paper dodges and wiles, it is almost certain that it won’t

It would be interesting to know if the See-O’Sullivan

The Victorian revenue for the month was
£545,401, as compared with £706,942 for May, 1901-a
,bp of £161,541. This appalling downfall ali arose out
of the decline in customsand excise, the amount returned
by the Commonwealth being £167,489 less than the
amount returned during May, 1901. The revenue for the
eleven months seems to be about £6,315,307, a fall of
some £540,000 as .compared with the corresponding
period of 1901. Ordinary and loan expenditure are not
stated, but a large deficit appears certain—and, by the
fatality of things, the long, pale, wavering hand of
bhiels takes the financial helm just at this crisis. The
Boer war curse, and the brutal selfishness of the Jingo
gang which sent the contingents, and declared its readi-
ness—in fact, its absolute craving—to “ make sacrifices
for the Empire,” and which, after all, wouldn’t sacrifice a
copper, but left the public finances to go to wrack and
niin by reason of the war-bill, are coming home to roost
in dead earnest.
Queensland has struck- a worse disaster than
usual during May. The revenue dropped on every point.
Railways declined about £5000; land revenue, £BOOO •
taxation, £BOOO ; miscellaneous receipts, £3OOO. Curiously
enough, there is no mention of any refund from the
Commonwealth—-whether it didn’t arrive in time, or
somebody stole it, or Queensland produced so little cus-
toms revenue during May that the amount only covered
its share of the Federal expenditure, doesn’t appear. The
published figures are as follows
Queensland (II Months to 31st May).
• Revenue. Expenditure. Surplus.
1901 .. £3,794,007 £3,639,047 £154,960
1902 .. 8,181,105 3,024,892 156,213
Decrease .. £612,902 £614,155
Increase .. £1,253
Queensland’s loan expenditure for the eleven months was
£1,024,160, as compared with £1,033,151 during the cor-
responding period of last year, a decrease of £8991. The
loan expenditure is a wildly ridiculous amount for a
population of half-a-million—over £2 per inhabitant
annually. Still Queensland, which for a number of years
has held the second worst place (after Westralia) for loan
extravagance, will probably be only fourth this time,
Westralia, N.S.W., and Maoriland being all in front of it.
.As Queensland has about £750,000 to pay for interest on
its public debt on Ist July, the deficit will probably be
about £ 500,000.
Yet if Premier Philp were as utterly un-
principled in matters of public finance as was George
Reid in N.S W. he could finish the year with a
paper surplus of about £200,000 or more, and pose, d la
Reid, as the Man that Saved the Country. Reid simply
decided that for one year he would charge himself with
only six months’ interest on a cirbiin part of the public
debt. The interest for the six months from January to
June has to be handed over to the bank, as agents for the
public creditors, about 15th June, but it is called money
still in hand on 30th June, and isn’t charged till
Ist July—in next financial year. By such weird
dodges Reid produced his one big surplus, and the
shameful S.M Herald and Telegraph backed him up
in the Calico Jimmy interest, and refused to expose the
trick, and swore to the genuineness of the surplus. If
Philp got down to the same level he could have a surplus
also, even in this blank and doleful year.

Vanning Tables.—The very newest and what
gives exceedingly fair promise of superseding all other
tables is the machine known as the Wesle.v-Baird Vanning
Table. The table is of South Australian invention, and
has given excellent results on Broken Hill ores and ores
containing pyrites, carbonate of copper and tin. Like all
tables, the best work is done on “ fines,” and more espe-
cially when the product is properly classified. The
Central Mining and Tramway Co., of 424 Little Collins-
street, Melbourne, and 40 Hunter-street, Sydney, are the
sole agents in the Eastern States. The table has a capa-
city up to 30 tons per day.*

An interesting little mining community is that
of the Shetlanders on the West Coast of Maoriland
between Grey mouth and Hokitika- Sometime in the
Ws about a dozen young men from the Ultima Thule
of Scotland settled down together on the sea beach there
and began to wash out the gold which they found mixed
with the black iron-sand of the coast. The peculiarity of
the Shetlanders’ field is that, unlike most diggings, it is
permanent, for every storm throws up fresh gold-bearing
sand, and the men of the far north are always on the job.
The first batch of miners were soon joined by several of
their friends and relations of both sexes with the result
that there are now three generations at work on the
beach. Some of the old hands are reported to be worth
their several weights in gold.

Tasmania is not doing so badly as some of its neighbors,
still it is doing badly enough. The trouble is the same
as with the other States: Under the Federal tariff the
people ceased to pay inter-State duties ; the Government
didn’t make them pay any new direct taxation in place
of it, and so the revenue is running short.
Westralia, being allowed still to collect its full
inter-State duties (a privilege extended to no other State)
is doing well. It is doing much better than it deserves
considering the villainous selfishness of most of its
Federal members, and their utter disregard, in voting for
the reduction of duties, for the revenues of other States
which are not allowed to collect border customs. For the
11 months up to 31st May, 1902, revenue was £3,299,928,
an increase of £520,000 above the revenue for the corres-
ponding period of last year. The surplus bids fair to reach
£300,000. But for the border duties there would have
been a serious deficit, and when these duties taper off
Westralia will probably have about the worst time of all
the States under the tariff which its members have
toiled so hard to make as low as possible.
The London Bank of Australia, which issues
the smallest and flabbiest bank-note in this country,
begins to make headway against its troubles. These
arose partly from the fact that it never got a reduction
of interest on its fixed deposits as many other institutions
did—in fact, it is the only bank still in the reconstructed
state which pays the full 4£ per cent, rate on its old
deposits. Further trouble arose out of the fact that it
agreed, Heaven only knows wh3 r , to pay 5J per cent,
interest on its preference shares whether the interest was
earned or not. It is a cumulative liability', and, as far as
the amount of the preference capital (£171,930) is con-
cerned, the only important result of making it preference
capital instead of reconstructed deposits is that it costs
£1719 per year more in interest. Despite these draw-
backs, however, things are looking up very materially.
In the table which follows, the year 1893 is merely the
fragment of the year from the date of reconstruction up
to 31st December :

1901.. 23,354 5J ~ = 9456 13,898 6790
The balance-sheet shows a reserve of £10,518, but against
that must be set the fact that the cumulative preference
dividend of 5£ per cent, is still 6 months (£4728) in arrear,
so the net reserve is as shown above. It is the first time
since 1895 that the London Bank of Australia has had a
genuine reserve, and the progress that has been made at
wiping off the big deficit of 1897 is very gratifying.
The profits are at the rate of £2 11s. sd. per
cent, per annum on the shareholders’ net funds as at the
commencement of the year —a great improvement on the
£1 12s. 4d. per cent, of 1900. The advance is largely
owing to the repayment of the burdensome per cent,
reconstructed deposits and the consequent saving in in-
terest. These old deposits have stood as follows during
the past six years :
London Bank’s Reconstructed 4J per cent. Deposits :
December, 1896 £3,716,087 December, 1899 £2,232,675
„ 1897 3,260,678 ~ 1900 1,911,964
„ 1898 3,189,098 „ 1901 1,591,092
As these deposits cost a considerable amount above the
market rate there is room for a material further
saving when the remainder of the burden is lifted. Apart
from the reduction of the reconstructed deposits
nothing much has happened during 1901. The new
deposits have decreased by nearly £4OOO and some
other items also show a slight decrease, while the
cash reserve has dropped (presumably through the re-
payment of the reconstructed deposits) from £1,033,227
to £914,535. It still represents, however, the quite
sufficient margin of 26 per cent, on all callable liabilities.
In addition the bank has £661,489 described as “ Invest-
ments and Bills Receivable.” Presumably some of these
are Government securities, but the fact is not made
clear. In some ways the London Bank of Australia is
very reticent about its affairs ; still the general impres-
sion is that respectable progress is being made. The
surplus, after payment of the preference dividend, would
be equal to £1 17s. 4d. per cent, on the ordinary capital,
so a 5 per cent, dividend to the ordinary shareholders
appears to be a long way off yet, though it looks much
nearer than it did four years ago.

(a) In the case of the Bank of New Zealand the
£2,000,000 borrowed at 4 per cent, for 10 years on the
State guarantee is treated as a fixed deposit—it being re-
payable it can’t be regarded as capital. All the profits
were written off to help provide for losses made before
the State control commenced,
(b) Most of the London Bank’s surplus, after paying
dividend, went in extinguishing an old deficit.
(bb) Bank of Australasia wrote off £20,000,
(c) Union Bank wrote off £35,000.
(d) Commercial Bank of Australia wrote off £30,000
towards the deficit in its Assets Trust.
(e) Queensland National Bank wrote off £25,745 towards
reducing the accumulation of old losses.
(/) Of the A.J.S. Bank’s earnings only £3584 was
ordinary banking profit, the other £12,663 being made by
the repurchase, at a great discount, of reconstructed
deposits. No less than £164,047 of the reserves were
built up by the repurchase of depreciated deposits.
( g ) Royal Bank of Queensland wrote off £3OOO.
(h) Ballarat Banking Co. wrote off £3OO.
The biggest gross profits are those of the Aus-
tralasia, Bank of N.S.W., Bank of New Zealand, Union,
Commercial of Australia, and Commercial of Sydney, in
that order. Five banks pay 10 per cent, or over : The
Westralian (17$ p.c.), and the National (Maoriland), Aus-
tralasia, the N.S.W., and the Commercial of Sydney (all
10 p.c.). Three banks pay no dividend ; three more pay
on preference shares only. The hanks which, according
to their last balance-sheets, put the largest proportion of
their earnings to reserves were the A.J.S., National
(Maoriland), E.S. & A., London, Westralian, Royal (Mel-
bourne), and North Queensland. Out of 24 banks, 12
have reserves, on paper at all events, exceeding £lOO,OOO,
and four (the Australasia, Union, Commercial of Sydney,
and N.S.W.) are over £1,000,000. Four reserves are ad-
mitted to exist on paper only, there being losses to pro-
vide for which will more than swallow them up, and a
fifth is practically admitted to be in the same situation.
But, with all deductions, they are a better-looking lot
than they were four or five years ago. Largely by reason
of big loans the lost boom has been looking up again in
recent times.

Cable from Maoriland: —“Wellington, Mon-
day.—Meat will be dearer than it has ever been. There
is everywhere a shortage of fodder, oats, chaff, potatoes,
and like produce, and Maoriland will not have any to
spare for Australia. Within the last 18 months 175,000
tons of oats have been sent to South Africa, for the fulfil-
ment of orders from the Imperial Government, and there
has been some difficulty in getting that quantity.” And,
in face of this, the party which would sell its soul to drag
down the Federal Government (the Govt, which is going
to abolish free newspaper postage), tries to persuade the
public that it is only the duties which.prevent Maoriland
sending us lots of fodder for our starving sheep—the
fodder which squatters couldn’t afford to buy even if it
was here.

Over two months ago it was noted nere that
important changes were pending in Broken Hill manage-
ments. The retirement of general-manager Greenway, of
Block 14, was one of them. For some reason or other the
co.’s internal troubles were patched up for the time, and
only now the resignation, to take immediate effect, is
announced. Enough has been said hitherto about the
management of this co., and nothing need be said now,
except that the present is a very good opportunity to
drop the system of having a “ managing director.” There
is no room for a managing director in a mining co. whose
board and general manager know their work and do it.
Mr. Green way, who became connected with B.H. as a
metallurgist in its early days, did good service to the field
by inducing the South (of which he was then consulting
metallurgist) to take up the jig treatment of sulphides.
That was early in ’94. Block 14 followed with a plant in
May the same year. These were the first practical means
to treat Broken Hill sulphides—poor and wasteful
appliances, hut the best offering. From them the modern
plants, still poor and wasteful, have been evolved. Mr.
Greenway goes to the charge of a N.Q. tin proposition.
The diamond-drill prospecting at toe British
B.H. last half-year cost 10s. Id. per ft. It has since then
been got down a few pence below that.
* * * *
B.H. Block 10 adopts a new plan so far as the
Barrier goes—it doesn’t charge its working account with
the money which is being spent on the new main shaft.
Well, seeing that the shaft is not a prospecting work,
there is something to be said for the plan, though if it
had not been such a wretchedly bad half-year for the co.
nothing would have been heard of it. If, however, such
things are not charged for as the money is spent, share-
holders and others will have to watch that a fair per-
centage charge is made every subsequent half-year.
Hitherto, with only machinery thus dealt with, the so-
called “ depreciation ” charge has been regarded by many
directorates as handy goods to dress the window with—to
put in or leave out, to make much or little, as best suited
their book. Block 10 certainly has not been the biggest
sinner in this respect—has, in fact, been among the
smallest.
• * * *
Of the B.H. Prop.’s 900,000 shares 637,490 are
on the London register. Adelaide now holds more shares
than Melbourne —159,636 against 101,911. Sydney’s little
lot is 43,358.

About half-a-dozen members travelled to Broken
Hill to attend the Mining Engineers’ annual conference ;
but local members made up a decent-sized crowd at
most of the meetings, held in the very fine but little-used
Technical College lately built there. The layman and
investor or speculator would have yawned over most of
the papers ; even the crowd that did turn up would have
been happier if two or three wearisome efforts had been
taken as read. B.H. Prop, mine-manager Horwood’s, on
the desulphurisation of slimes, was, from the outsider s
view-point, the most valuable. His co. is now attacking
the slime dumps on a big scale, building up thousands of
tons in heaps, up to 200 ft. long, lift, high, and
25ft. wide at the base, the outer supporting walls
and long oblong flues being made of the same
slimes formed into bricks, and plastered also with slimes.
A barrow-load or two of brush-wood is enough to light
the kiln ; the heavy percentage of sulphur does the rest,
in little under a month the stuff is cooked, and there is
a new meal for the smelters-a meal which they could not
digest raw. The lead loss is 10 per cent, to 12 per cent. ;
the silver loss up to 5 per cent. There is considerable
zinc loss, which, of course, is a gain so far as smelting is
concerned, The sulphur is reduced from 16 per cent, to
7or 8 per cent. These slimes form about 10 per cent, of
the total mill products of the field, and although con-
taining 20 per cent, lead and 18oz. silver, have hitherto
been useless, except at the top of the lead and zinc boom,
when they were shipped to Europe. One manager said
the success of this roasting was worth to B.H. as much as
a £1 rise in lead; Mr. Horwood committed the co.
to a profit of £1 a ton of slimes. Read either
way it is highly important. The big B.H. Prop., which
has not led in many processes, not being so hard-up as
the others, is whollv responsible for the experiments,
which led to this treatment; the others have merely
checked results. The success of this system largely
explains why the co.’s have not rushed the Carmichael-
Bradford desulphurising process, which, though theoreti-
cally more perfect, requires more elaborate apparatus.
• * * *
There was a time when, with the one exception
of Zeb Lane, there was not a single Australian-trained
manager on the Broken Hill lode E. J. Horwood, the
present mine manager of the B.H. Prop., and J Hebbard,
mine manager of the Sulphide Corporation—the next
biggest concern are both Victorian-trained. Wain-
wright, who has done remarkably good work at the
South is a product of the Adelaide School of Mines. And'.
to these is now added F. S. Low, manager of Block 10,
Victorian-trained. Only these few mines are making
profit. .
The stagnation in mining in N.S.W. is shown
in the fact that at a recent auction sale an almost new
20-ton water-jacket copper-furnace was sola tor i-o i
Great Cobar : Mr. A. S. Joseph (a former resi-
dent of Sydney and Tamworth) has secured an option on
all the properties owned by the Oobar syndicate, exc p -
ing their Nymagee mine. It is understood t
price is £1,060,000, and of this amount £56°, 000 will go
to the Great Cobar Co. The scheme has been agreed to
by ail parties in the lawsuits re the mine, and now awaits
the formal sanction of shareholders. This being give,
Mr. Joseph has to put up a deposit of £25,000, ana,
within a specified time, complete the contract.
he fail to do so, the Tribute Syndicate has the nght to
purchase the mine at a price which will retur
£4 15s. per share, and as they are supposed to own
5-6ths of the shares, this will mean practically taking
money out of one pocket and putting it into
another; or they may have the mine for a long term
of years on the same basis upon which other peopl
had agreed to take it on the expiry of the present tribute.
Viewed in any light the arrangement between the syndi-
cate and the minority of shareholders in the co. is a
sensible one. Mr. Joseph’s principals evidently mean
business, as they have engaged Mr. Rich, Superintendent
of the Rio Tinto mines, to report on the properties. Mr.
Rich, who is now on his way to Australia, is recognised
as being in the foremost rank of copper-mining authori-
ties. He will doubtless be astonished at a field of sucn
magnitude as Cobar being so little known abroad, and he
is certain to be surprised at the local systems ot working.
Mine-owners will do well not to expect any compliments
from him on that score.

Officially reported that the Fingal mine “never
looked better ” than it does at present. Lode has been
driven on for 250 ft. at No. 8 level and is said to be better
in quality than at No. 7. Mine seems destined to become
one of the most productive and permanent in W.A.
Another example of the Victorian’s capacity for failing to
recognise a good thing when he has it —outside his own
territory. Victorians were early on the scene in W. A.
with their characteristic “ go ” and enterprise, but out oi
dozens of successful mines they failed to secure one.
Hence the total neglect of W.A. stocks in Colhns-st.
The dirty linen of the London and Globe Cor-
poration went through the washing in the official liquid-
ators’ court without coming out any cleaner for the
operation. Another attempt is to be made to remove the
black stains in the law courts, the Corporation having
ntered an action against a firm of stockbrokers for
£1,000,000, alleged damage done to the co. in connection
with transactions in L. V. Consols shares. But the only
persons to profit will be the lawyers.
A return just issued by Westralian Mines De-
partment shows that during the four months of the year
27 men were killed and 47 injured in mines, as against 45
killed and 130 injured during same months last year.
This is claimed to be a direct result of the new mining
regulations, which may or may not be the case. Acei-
dents in mines seem to occur in cycles. At Bendigo, for
example, where there has been no .relaxation of regula-
tions, more men have been killed this year already than
were killed last year, and in every instance the misfor-
tune has, admittedly, been purely accidental

“ Assez ”: The North Lyell sacking business re-
calls an incident in the early history of the big mine,
when a few light-weight stamps driven by a toy water-
wheel, some shovels, picks, and wheelbarrows constituted
the plant. A director, whose name will ever be asso-
ciated with the mines, visited the field and expressed
some dissatisfaction. “ What’s the matter?” asked the
manager, an unsophisticated amateur. “ Why,” said the
director, “ you are hog-rooting the mine and washing
the gold down Linda Creek—everything is wrong.”
** Are my accounts wrong?” asked the manager. “ No,”
replied the director; “ but, by the gods, everyth ng else
is, and you’d better quit right away.” Same day the
manager started off to Strahan on a half-bred donkey,
this being the only animal capable of negotiating the
then journey with an3' degree of safety. Mr. Trent had
the pull on this manager in that he was able to leave the
field in a luxuriously-upholstered railway-carriage.

Mr. Trent, ex-General Manager of the North
Lyell sent The Bulletin a characteristic letter, dated
« At ’Sea, May 2.” Into 3pp. MS. he has compressed
enough libels‘(they may be true enough) to ruin all the
newspapers in Australia. Mr. Trent will be able to let
off steam in one of the big U.S. mining journals.

able will be disappointed at the official intimation that an
enormous quantity of over-burden has to be shifted ere
the wholesale washing away of the tin-bearing drift can
be commenced. It will be some time yet before it will be
demonstrated whether or not the project will be success-
ful to the extent of one-half of boomsters’ proclaimed
anticipations, and it will be a big achievement if it does
that. It may do it, but not more— assuming that tin
remains at anything like present quotation. That is
a chance which it will take a bold man to speculate upon,
as the tin market is noted for its violent fluctuations.

Mount Lyell: Figures for May show what a
mighty factor the N. Lvell contract was towards keeping
up the product last half year, and make it clear that
without it there would have been little, if any, profit.
In May, not having N. Lyell ore to treat, co. handled
2750 tons more of its own ore than it did in April, but the
copper product came down by 178 tons. The steady
decline as the supply of contract ore was diminishing is
shown thus : Fel). output, 788 tons copper ; March, 766 ;
April 706; May, 588. It is questionable whether, at the
present price of copper, Lyell is returning any appreciable
profit, andin theabsenceof any satisfactory development in
■the deep ground the high price of shares can be accounted
for only on the supposition that operators are hopeful that
the price of copper will soon improve. There may be
•gome foundation for this hope in the report that there is a
prospect of the three groups of American copper mag-
nates (the Amalgamated Trust, the Heinze group, and
the Calumet and'liecla group) coalescing. It is stated
that the Heinze people, who profited enormously by selling
their copper at high prices while the Amalgamated Trust
was holding stocks back, now find it convenient to join
forces with the Amalgamated, and should they
do so the Calumet people, too, will have to fall
Into line. The reports of the co’s. controlled by
the Amalgamated show that last half-year the cost
•of production, in every instance, largely exceeded
the average price of metaL It is an established fact that
there are very few copper-mines in the world which can
work at a profit when the value of metal is below £5O.
It is assumed that, when the three powers named com-
bine, they will, of necessity, operate so as to considerably
raise the price. This will be the opportunity of mine-
owners outside the combination, and the possibility of it
prompts the suggestion that it might be sound financial
policy on the part of Mt. Lyell to accumulate stocks.
Surely it would be better to utilise the reserve fund
in this way than to disburse it in divs. As against
the idea of there being a chance of a marked improve-
ment in the value of copper at an early date, it has to be
noted that English and Continental buyers have been
making enormous purchases during the past six months.
The exports from America for the first three months of
the year totalled over 80 per cent, of the production as
against less than 25 per cent, in the corresponding period
last year. .
purely it would be as easy, under a proper
system of registration of the workings of mines, to give
notice to all concerned of the existence of those workings,
as it is under the Torrens system of land transfer to give
notice to all abutting owners of any contemplated deal-
ings with a block of land. If the sad Cardigan mining
disaster brings about a more satisfactory method of call-
ing the attention of mine owners to the proximity of old
workings and their consequent duty to their workers, it
will not have been altogether without useful conse-
quences.

to those of Badger, the Yankee manager for the foreign

Brisbane suburban passenger traffic right under the

of the State railways. A practical project to equip its
own suburban lines with electric trams, and thus retain
the profits of the traffic, was recently flouted by the fool

Strikes of capital are prevalent in Queensland
just now. First, the pearling monopoly threatened to
strike, and “ chuck ” the Empire because “ freedom of
contract ” in cheap niggers was threatened by the Immi-
grants’ Restriction Act. Next, Cobb and Co. downed
tools, and demanded higher pay on account of the
drought. Then the Mt. Morgan Co., which has already
paid £6,000,000 in divs., threatened to close up the town
of Mt. Morgan, with 9000 inhabitants, unless the
State pauperises it with bonuses in the shape of
cheap water. Now, the financial ring, which owns
the Q. pastoral industry, is engineering another
strike for lower rent and easier terms for its leases. Yet,
if a lot of workers were to strike for a few shillings a
week extra on account of increased cost of living, the
indignant howl of these gentlemen would be heard
almost in the moon.

AT THE “ TATTOO."
NEW-CHU REPORTER : “ Tell me, Colonel, does
it take very long to tattoo a whole regiment? ”
With what fatuousness the Anglican people
manage their church affairs ! The other day the
venerable Dean Cowper, on his death-bed, was
allowed to participate in a special communion
service at St. Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney, the
sacrament being brought from the church to the
deanery in the church grounds. The incident was
a touching one, but promptly some malignantly
conscientious people rushed to the papers with a
complaint that this amounted to “Reservation
of the Sacrament ” and to Romanism and Scarlet
Womanism and affinity with the Babylonian
lady of bad character. Instead of treating the
graceless complaints with stolid contempt, or
with the thunders of excommunication, or some-
thing, poor old Primate Smith sends a small
apologetic letter to Sydney D.T., which is care-
fully printed in a small apologetic way in an
obscure comer of the paper. “His Grace”
writes:—
It is with much regret that I have observed that the
administration of the Holy Communion to the Dean on
the day of the consecration of the Bishop of Gippsland
has been used as an occasion for public comment. When
I acceded to the Dean’s desire that he should be a fellow-
communicant in that special service, I regarded the case
as claiming, or at least admitting of, special treat-
ment, elc M etc.
Just fancy a man who is Primate of All Australia
apologising and explaining in a small corner of a
Sydney newspaper in that style !

According to S.M. Herald, news of the

with delight, enthusiasm, excitement, joy, jubila-
tion, pleasure, rejoicing, satisfaction (general,
great, much, intense), thankfulness, relief and
gladness, joy and satisfaction, quiet joy and
thankfulness, favorably—and so on. Why will
the local Joskins of every tagrag, tinpot township
storm forth and furiously wave cow-bells, and
then rush to the nearest telegraph-office and wire
its mighty heart-throb on these occasions ? And
why does any allegedly sane paper inflict upon the
weary public columns of such inanity ?

The effort to work up a “ Maffick ” in
Melbourne on Monday, when news of the Peace-
at-any-Price came through, ended in a dismal
fizzle. One or two converted Jingoes started out
with the evident intention of leading Collins-st.
into dissipation and devilment, but, finding that
they were left severely alone, and feeling the
ignominy of acting the goat “ on their own,’" they
presently stole into pubs., and the city seemed, if
anything, a little more depressed than usual. The
men “on ’Change ” had their little hoo-roo time
strictly in private, and talked awfully at each
other for hours. _ Their demonstration was fizz
and fizzle. At night the streets were crowded,
but only by young men and young women, who
romped moderately while the elders droned like
blowflies in the Town-hall. A lame, dull, dish-
watery anti-climax after the loyal fantods and the
maniacal cow-play of Mafeking time. The be-
trayed Jingoes were willing to acclaim the Cham-
berlain back-down as a “glorious peace,” but they
simply couldn’t get drunk on it.
In Sydney the damp, dull gloom was even more
marked. For nearly two years bonfires had been
kept in readiness, stocks of the best “lambing-
down” liquor reserved in the public-houses, fire-
works stored up, illuminating designs thought
out, bales of flags and crates of tin trumpets put
by, in readiness for the day when the Boers would
“unconditionally surrender.” But when Peace-
at-any-Price was concluded there was never a
bonfire, or a rocket, or a flag, or a razzle-dazzle, or
a trumpet, or a crowd outside a Jingo newspaper-
office, or anything.

Premier See’s difficulties with the men of
the 2nd N.S.W. contingent about pay-arrears
(altogether some £40,000 is involved) are not
smoothed by the latest action of the Crown.
After a series of delays, many of them looking
very like put-offs, date of trial \vas fixed, but the
Crown stepped into court the other day and
obtained a postponement till next sittings—so the
men must hang about till August. The reason
given by the Crown in claiming the postponement
was mainly that Col. Roberts, a necessary witness,
had gone to the Coronation. If the men, in the
end, win their claim, some member of Assembly
will probably move that an extra sum be awarded
them to indemnify them for Govt, dilatoriness.
Even though the men receive their full claims
from the court in August, they will have consumed
most of the amount in waiting.

The contingenters returned per Aurania
came with the reputation of being particularly hot
stuff. If reports were true, they had raised Sheol
and Willy Riley in Capetown, and had spread
such a fool-fury in Albany that the residents had
been glad to pass the time of their stay under the
stable, out of harm’s way ; but, when Lieut.-Col.
Lassetter was interviewed by an anxious press on
this point, he was righteously indignant. “The
men,’ he said, “were as fine a body as he had
ever had to do with.” _ Just so. There have been
complaints of the kind before, and, in every
instance Thk Bulletin remembers, the men were
quite the finest body, and most decorous and
admirable ; warriors the C.O. had had to deal with.
The B. is not denying anything, it is simply
wondering at the devilish persistence with which
a malign Fate gouges holes in the reputations of
the sweetest, neatest, most sober and sensitive
soldiery that ever said prayers before breakfast,
and spent all its “off duty ” chanting psalms, and
studying urbanity and table manners.

Kernel Lassetter, who takes himself so
seriously with his “my men,” “my boys,” will
probably loom large in N.S.W. military affairs
again now that Gen. Hutton is in command. Col.
Lassetter didn’t “ hit it” with Gen. French, and
resigned in a huff because Jawbone Neild, or
somebody of that sort, was given precedence of
him in a camp. N.S.W. thus lost to active service
for while a valuable and much-liked officer.

The latest session of Melb. divorce court
has revealed nothing more domestically interest-
ing than the wisdom of a pretty co re., who won
the affections of an erring husband. The vic-
torious petitioner in the case stated that her
faithless husband, 18 months after marriage,
became addicted to staying away at night. He
told her that he had been out with a young
woman, a blonde; and that he ought to have
married a fair girl, as petitioner’s nature did not
suit his. Shortly before the birth of the second
child he brought the co-re. to live at the house, and
the wife accused him of misconduct. He admitted
it. She commenced to cry, and the co-re. came in
and asked her what was the matter. She told
her, and the co-re. said : “There is no harm in it,
as long as nobody else, knows it.” She was evi-
dently a sympathetic interloper, with an up-to-
date reverence for Mrs. Grundy. Nothing of the
reckless brazen-face about her ! Her instincts
were respectably human. One pictures her with
an affectionate arm resting on the shoulder of the
tearful matron saying, in a tone of simple convic-
tion : “ There’s no harm in it, as long as nobody
else knows it.” Very many sins are only sins
when they are found out.
BUCOLIC PING-PONG.—A VARIANT OF A CURRENT ADVT.
An Auckland (M.L.) old-age pensioner
lately shocked officialdom by calling round in a
cab, with a bright young female beside him, for
his dole. When he had got it, he tripped out
jauntily, pinched the lady’s knee as he scrambled
into the cab, waved his hand and squeaked
“ Home ! ” And home they went at a fine old
pace. A good portion of Maoriland is quite
shocked, but wherefore no sane man can say. The
old-age pension is not charity, and the sooner
Australasia recognises that fact the better.
The latest version of “That strawberry-
mark I Me che-ild !! Me long-lost che-ild !!! ”
In the “yard” of an Australian asylum for the
poor two veterans, one over 80 years of
age, and the other a comparative youth
of 60 summers, were sunning them-
selves on a bench. The elder began
to yarn about a son who had ’listed 40
years before, and fell, covered with gore
and glory, at Cabul, when the younger
man suddenly interrupted : “ Had the
bloke a queer mark on his left arm,
where yer welted him with a waddy ? ”
Veteran: “I b’lieve he had.” Youth:
' “An’ had he a scar over the right ear,
where yer bruk a bottle over his ’ead ? ”
Veteran: “ Yes, but who the h ”
Youth: “Take that for me, an’ THAT for
Cabul, an’ THAT for the ole ’ooman,

separated father and sou was terminated

should be kept apart until Death separated

A good story is told as to the mother
of a well-known Ael >. physician, famed for
her philanthropy and her absolute ignorance
of slang. One day she saw a man lying, ap-

stopped her carriage, got out, and asked him
in a kind motherly voice what ailed him.
“ Tight! ” was the reply. “ Tight! where ? ”
she asked anxiously, suspicious of apoplexy,
“Is it your collar?” She unfastened his
neckband ; but he dismally shook his head.
“Is it your waistcoat?” She unbuttoned
that. Still no relief. “ Poor soul ! tell me
where you are tight?” “All over the
shop,” was the reply. That was an impos-
sible loosening “proposition.”

Of mercy and of grace, forgive our ranting, canting

For spawn of thieves and harlots’ brats in stifling slum

That they may get a gleam of joy through all the gorgeous

For twice ten million suffering brutes, whom flouted law
oppresses,
For men and women woe-begone in life’s extreme

Look over, if it please thee, Christ, the golden rose of
fashion
And pity those condemned to share Thy still enduring

conduct had led to his wife undergoing a serious

Hobart Mercury now urges Tasmania to
take advantage of Coronation time to erect a
statue of Queen Victoria (it has been collecting for
the statue since the Queen’s death, and has just
£2OO in hand !). But now the statue is to be of a
new sort: —
The memorial or monument which we might erect
might be like that of Janus, only with a difference.
Instead of two faces, a competent artist might design a
memorial which should have a double signification ; one
relating to the great Queen and the noble time which lies
behind us, and one which should embody in some
beauteous form the future to which we look, and look
•vith good warrant, as full of promise of great national
developments and gain.
Perhaps the Mercury might pool with E. W.
O’Sullivan and have a Janus statue, one side of
which is the late Queen and the other Australia
Facing the Dawn. But, on reflection, isn’t the
suggestion shockingly disloyal—to give the deceased
Queen only half a statue and to put her back-to-
back with some “ beauteous form” as a means for
suggesting unfavorable comparisons ?

Hobart is just now in a turmoil owing to
the denudation of the historio and picturesque
little city shrubbery known as Franklin-square.
Same Govt, official—no one seems to know exactly
who—has ordered that the place is to be turned
into a combination of desert and lawn. A few
trees have been spared, but what was once a
delightfully sequestered nook presents now a most
forlorn appearance. The papers are being bom-
barded with letters of protest against the van-
d ilism, but without avail.
In Sydney, just now, the lives of the “ twin
figs ” in front of the old Education Department
buildings are threatened; and a prompt protest
should be made by citizens interested in preserv-
ing these beautiful trees. There is a class in
Australia which looks upon a tree as an enemy of
mankind; hence the reckless denudation of
forests, and such outrages as the destruction of
the fig-trees in front of the Sydney Hotel Metro-
pole—replaced by an asphalted cab-stand.

Sydney Fire Brigade is already arranging

Butchers’ meat is now dearer in Sydney
than it has been for the last 50 years; and,
curiously enough, the breaking of the drought is
looked for by experienced meat-men to cause a
still further increase, because “ owners will then
hold on to cattle in order to fatten same and try
and recoup their losses.” Many of the poorer
classes, it is stated, now go to the abattoirs for
offal—hearts, livers, sheep’s-heads, &c. at one
time allowed to be removed gratis, but for which,
it is said, the carcase-butchers are now compelled,
by the tightness of the times, to make a small
charge.

It is difficult to even regard seriously the
proposal that, as a remedy for the meat-scarcity
caused by the drought, the health authorities m
Sydney should allow the carcases of tuberculous
animals to be eaten after the excision of such parts
as show tubercular cavities. Yet that request has
been cold-bloodedly put forward by a fat deputa-
tion to the State Premier, who is “ taking time to
consider the proposal.” The present system is to
destroy the carcases of all slaughtered animals
found to be infected with tuberculosis; and,
it is pointed out, that this
lot of good meat.” Safe to say that if the N.S. W.
Government is so foolish as to tamper with the
diseased-meat regulations in this way, a lot more
good meat will be wasted by rotting in the but-
chers’ shops. The sensible way of coping with the
meat scarcity is to make an effort to develop our
fish resources. Countless tons of good food swim
around our coasts, and a little well-directed orga-
nisation would bring the supply cheaply to our
tables. #

“ Alba ” tells of a lost purse :
Yesterday a woman getting off the
ferry-boat at Lavender Bay dropped her
purse, containing £3, into the water.
Several well-meaning persons fished for it
with hooks and pieces of wire, but the
purse refused to bite. Then the woman,
seized with an idea, left by return boat
for town. Suddenly and without noise
the Push came from its lair—under boat-
sheds, bags, and the wind-sheltered two-
up school between the rocks. The
Lavender Push is noted for its bad
cough, its thin chest and bulging spine.
On cold, wet nights one hears the push
coughing among sewer pipes and other
dark places. For three minutes it stared
at the water that held the purse,
and after a deal of coughing it decided
to send an undersized pushite in quest
of the £3. It was bitterly cold, a bleak
southerly struck the water like sheets of
ice as the pushite stripped and dropped
with a shudder into the blue. Three
seconds later he rose, clutching mud in
both hands. He repeated the perform-
ance until a strange blueness crept over
his body and an occasional bloodstreak-
showed where he had touched the pile-
bamacles in his descent. Another cough-
racked pushite was chosen and sent into
the water while the others cheered him
with words of hope and promises of the
beer that the purse would bring. After
the push had dived itself blue and
covered itself with shudders and bar-
nacle-wounds, the woman re-appeared,
accompanied by a gigantic nigger, who
climbed under the jetty, hung his clothes
on a cross-beam, and slipped like an alli-
gator into the water. The woman held
her breath and said, “ It’s Bill’s wages
what’s in the purse.” Then the crowd held its breath as
the nigger’s form shot up, holding Bill’s wages in his right
hand, a stone in the other. As he pulled himself up to
the pier a pushite whistled shrilly, and in a flash his 20
narrow-chested friends piled themselves upon the nigger,
shouting “Thief! thief! where’s the poor woman’s
purse?” The black man fought like a panther,
twisting, wrastling, and tossing them from him in
coughing heaps—it was as though a black whale were
freeing itself from an army of crabs, until they
fastened in a simultaneous swarm about his knees and
throat. Then a bruised pushite demanded immediate
possession of the purse. The nig. answered by flinging it
back into the harbor. “ I’ll get de coin anoder time,”
he said, hoarsely. “ Yah, yo’got fleas on yeh. Git off
me ! ” Saw him, last night, loafing on the pier, waiting
for the moon to set; also saw the push crouching behind
a near boat-house, waiting for a black body to drop in.
If the push can keep awake as long as the nig., fight No.
2 will be worth seeing. The barbers on The Shore are
betting on the nig.
The bush J.P. again. T’other day at
Wagga Land Court a declaration was lodged by
an applicant for appraise-
ment properly signed,
but the J.P., before
whom the declaration was
signed, hadn’t room on
t he straight line provided
by Govt, for a J.P.’s sig-
nature, and scrawled his
name on the reverse side
—invalid, of course. An-
other one put in was
signed by the J.P. as
declarant, whilst "the
declarant witnessed the
J.P.’s signature ! A
J.P. was put into the
box to give evidence,
and for a time refused
to be sworn on the
ground that he was
a J.P. and “hisword <
oughter be good
enough in any court
of lor.’* Now, if a
common policeman made
such “bloomers” asthese,
he would be asked to state
reasons why he shouldn’t be
sacked. But a J.P.—never !
Another band of dirty brown strangers,
like the crowd which lately settled at Bondi
(Sydney), reached Albury lately, and the Sydney
dailies announced that they were diagnosed there
as “ Mexicans of Greek descent.” And, as likely
as not, they were ancient Hebrews from Green-
land all the time. Apropos, the writer smelt a
consignment of these gipsies the other day; they
filled a compartment of the tram, and if that com-
partment wasn’t boiled afterwards, then the
authorities lamentably failed in their duty. A
more rancid and fish-like race never came m his
way. If many more of their kind are likely to
knock at this country’s door an Official Smeller
of Immigrants (something like a tea-taster) should
be appointed at each port, and the Aliens Re-
striction Act should be amended to prevent per-
sons who are too “ high ” entering the country.
Also, The Bulletin regrets it didn’t suggest in
time that all suspected immigrants should be over-
hauled, without their clothes, by a male or female
doctor —whichever the case called for, and that any-
thing over loz. of detachable dirt should disqualify.
If its representative had smelt that tram-load of
human buzzards earlier it would have thought of
this —though, there is very little credit in that;
even Pulsford would have been threatened with
an idea under like circumstances. There are
many Italian gentlemen round Sydney whose
cleanliness isn’t exorbitant, but this paper
wouldn’t have the cruelty to confine the worst
Roman who ever pawed a banana in the same
paddock with the weird brown crew on Bondi
sands. If Miltiades was anything like that the
chances are that Artaphernes lost the battle of
Marathon through sacrificing everything in order
to get the windward position. Besides, even the
famous Immortal Band couldn’t do much if it had
to rush to battle holding its sword in one hand and
its nose in the other.

A farmer of Teddywaddy, Vic., has been
sent to trial for having neglected to call in a
doctor when his child was dying. Defendant and
his wife were believers in faith-healing, and when
the youngster fell ill one of them prayed for it.
As it got worse the two prayed ; when it continued
to grow worse the grandparents were invited to
pray too, and a great groaning and lofty catch-as-
catch-can rastling in prayer ensued, in the midst
of which the child died. All parties are members
of the “Christian Catholic Church of Zion.”
Really, it would seem about time that religious
education was permitted in Vic. State schools —
just enough to convince people that, from .a
medical point of view, it is better to have faith in
one packet of salts than in 50 creeds.

Brisbane’s City Health Commissioner
having formulated (under the Health Act) regu-
lations dealing with the unlawful sale of diseased
and adulterated foods and liquids, some of the
councillors at once put it upon record that they
considered “ that the local holders of certain con-
demned goods should be allowed to clear off their
stocks before any prosecutions took place! ”
Another, with tearful voice, said bitterly: “It’s
something cruel the way the Customs and other
officials dump the condemned stuff into the river.
It doesn’t give anyone a chance 1” The average
alderman is an enemy to the human race. At the
same time, there is a horrible tendency on the part
of health officials to silt up our precarious rivers
by dumping into them condemned food, which
should be burned along with a big percentage of
the aldermen.

The argument that barmaids are liable to
temptation is the best the Old Cat party offers
to support the demand for their abolition, and it is
not too good. Barmaiding is a semi-public occu-
pation, and the man who tries to say something to
the bar-girl calculated to lead her astray is con-
stantly interrupted by people coming in for liquor.
Probably the barmaid doesn’t fall half so often as
the domestic servant, or the factory girl, to say
nothing of the chambermaid in the coffee palace.
Will some M.L.A. move the Government to put
Statistician Cog'nlan (if he isn’t too busy) on the
search for this information: (1) What percentage
of the adult feminine population are barmaids?
(2) What percentage of the unmarried mothers
whose occupations can be traced through the re-
cords of public institutions are barmaids? In
other words, let the anti-barmaid crowd leave off
shouts and hysterics and get down to facts !

An attendant at Sydney Zoo has con-
tracted plague, and the gardens are to be
closed to the public until further notice. The
animals are still dying, and the council of
management has confessed its inability to pro-
perly run the grounds under present financial
arrangements. The Zoo, to put it emphatically,
smells. It always has smelt. It would be far
better for the young idea never to see the raging
tiger (huddled in a stuffy cage), or the fierce, wild
bear (wheezing and coughing in a smelly well),
than to continue to run the Zoo on lines of cheap-
ness and stink. Let us have a clean, healthy Zoo
or none at all.

Melb. timber-merchant John Sharp, re-
cently deceased, left £98,245, of which £9628 goes
to Vic. Govt, for probate duty.
TOO RISKY.
“ Oh, I wish I were a man !”
“ There you go — you never hear a man wish he
were a woman."
“ No; he might have to marry one of the leasts.”
Some remarks from “ W. 8.” :
Re your observations (26/4/’O2) on the working ol
Peacock’s old-age-pension test. An old miner of 77,
unmarried, without relatives, 50 years resident in Vic-
toria, quite incapable of work, was granted the maximum
under the first Act. Under the second Act (case heard
by an upstart 0.P.5.) he was offered ss. a week, was
threatened with reduction, and then with being sent away
without anything when he attempted to remonstrate.
Finally the functionary on the bench, seeing by the
attendant policeman’s countenance that he was going too
far, fixed it at 75., telling applicant that if he wanted the
other Is. he must fossick for it. Another old man,
shaking with age, was threatened with being given in
charge if he said another word, although he was only
attempting to explain that he could not work, and was
granted 3s. A tendency to threaten the applicant with
the utmost terrors of the law to begin with, appears to be
growing upon His Washup.

A man should always keep a revolver in
his house : it comes in so handy for the burglar.
A Katoomba (N.S.W.) alderman the other night
got up from his bed to remonstrate with a robber
when he was effectively quelled (and somewhat
seriously injured) by a revolver shot from his own
pistol, which the intruder had taken possession
of. The burglar got away with £25 —he left the
revolver for the convenience of the next thief.

A carping Victorian to The Bulletin :
If there be no foundation for the story that Lady Hope-
toun’s return to England was arranged prior to her hus-
band’s peevish renunciation of his billet, it seems a pity
that she should have got away in so violent a hurry “ on
her own ” without troubling to explain her reason for so
doing. Years ago, when Lord Hopetoun quitted Mel-
bourne in a blaze of cheap popularity, the Countess
shared the “ demonstration,” and, although she didn t
carry away a souvenir diamond necklace like her prede-
cessor, Lady Loch, she was seen to be on cordial nodding
terms with the populace at large. Last week, in her
more important capacity of Governor-Generaless, she
made her escape from Government House as quietly
as possible. Avoiding the city proper, she drove
to Port Melbourne pier, whither Alfred Deakin
and a few other people had unobtrusively pro-
ceeded to farewell the Countess in the name of the Com-
monwealth. This official leave-taking was a mere
mockery. Lady Hopetoun and the Commonwealth evi-
dently cared nothing for one another. She was imported
at vast expense—a Gov.-General’s wife is always spoken
of as the principal partner in the firm of figureheads, there-
fore she is imported—to play leading lady at functions,
useless and otherwise. Her engagement proved a dismal
failure. The unsuccessful performer threw up her part
without troubling to bow to the audience. Lady Hopetoun’s
casual exit is noteworthy only in its bearing on the ques-
tion whether her husband has a real grievance against
the Commonwealth. Claimed for the complainant that
his official expenditure exceeded his annual salary (and
allowances) by many thousands of pounds because he was
expected to keep up two big establishments and enter-
tain a small class of people whose admission to Govern-
ment House in no way benefits the main body of tax-
payers. Granted that Lord H. chose to think himself
expected to iive beyond his Australian salary, for which
mistake he and Premier Barton were to blame —granting
so much as that, it is at least permissible for the Com-
monwealth to ask whether the Hopetouns have been
satisfactory performers, anyhow. They were engaged at
£lO,OOO (and allowances) for the two of them, on the
understanding that the lady would come to the front
whenever her presence was called for, and turn her
position to useful account. Many little things can be
well done by a representative personage, and when she,
in conjunction with her husband, is a paid servant of the
State, she is expected to do some of those things. Lady
Hopetoun was not equal to the task. The Commonwealth
has cause to complain of shabby treatment, or insufficient
payment in figurehead work, from the Gov.-General’s
wife. It is not at all certain that Lord Hopetoun, for his
part, proved worthy of his hire. There can be no doubt
whatever as to the incapacity of the G.-G.’s better, but
more frozen, half.

The whistle’s shriek has pierced my heart—
You’re gone. I sink beneath the smart. • • •
I would God struck me deaf to-day—
“ Just hear the bells and shouts 1 ” they say
But as the cheering volleys passed

What do they care ? Oh God ! I miss
For evermore your step and kiss.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
_ Sydney, June 10, 1902.
Mr Dbar Arini,—•
Our new State Governor is earning his salary by
the sweat of his horses. The poor man has hardly
had an afternoon or an evening at home since his
arrival (the relavs of horses get a rest now and
again, but it’s the same Governor all the time).
Just now he looks as if he likes it, but a year
hence that jovial King-Neddish-porridge-and-
whisky expression of his will be replaced by
another, which we shall all translate into a des-
perate longing for a billet as lighthouse-keeper on
a far sea-rock. Sir Harry professes to be no
speech maker, but the nut of his “ few remarks ”
has always a good sound kernel. People who
have to listen to speeches love them little if they
are long. His first public function was at the
thirteenth annual meeting of Lewisham Hos-
pital. Mr. B. R. Wise praised the devotion
of the nursing sisters and announced that a ball
in aid of the hospital would be held shortly. As
the building account fund shows an overdraft of
pver £5OOO, there is need for the hospital to
dance out of debt as soon as possible.
Longstaff has luck in not having had to wait
long for a recognition of his merit as a portrait-
painter. The recognition is only his plain, un-
varnished right ; but so many great painters have
to learn the ache of long waiting. Longstaff isn’t
likely to get swollen head either. Persons who
see him in London say he is the same modest,
slow-speaking young man, looking as usual like a
heavyweight footballer. His portrait of the King
“ to oe companioned by one of the Queen.
Alexandra has consented to give him sittings, and
_it has been suggested’’(vague, impersonal phrase)
that the ladies of Sydney should defray the cost
of the Queen’s portrait. Longstaff’s painting
of Marjorie Williamson, if done by Millais
at a cost of 2000 guineas, would have caused
little diminution in that great artist’s reputation.
Some definition ought to be agreed upon of the
term actress, and of her status. At present any
woman who gets a stage flag to carry, or who
rushes on with the mob in a market place scene
describes herself as an actress and may be so
written down in the charge sheet of the police
COUrt ?L in the> indictment of some disgraceful
Ca ?t 6 ", .(The very disreputable he-loafer sometimes
calls himself an actor and sometimes a journalist)
A dissolute woman, found helplessly drunk in a
Melbourne street lately, on being taken to the
watch house, described herself as an actress and
g? l name of a star just then appearing in
Melbourne. In a recent down-south breach of
promise case the “ actress ” who played lead in the
squalid seno-comedy was utterly unknown to
recognised Australian actors or managers. It’s
rather hard that every female barn-stormer with a
no-line part should be allowed to describe herself
under the same professional category as—as—
well now, do you think it judicious to mention any
names ? J
Mr. F. Barron Morley, who left here some four
years ago to perfect his piano hand, gave his first
concert at Sydney Town Hall, to an immense audi-
ence, on Saturday night. In Vienna the famous
teacher with the awful name (Lesehetizky) fined
him down and polished him up brain and hand
and eye. F- B. Morley is a 6ft. young man with
none of the standard affectations, hairinesses, or
catlike graces of the male musical platform expert.
Me grabbed the laurel wreaths handed up over the
footlights and carried them to the back with the
air of a lion cub intending to roll on them.
Xhe quality of the programme was high—
Liszt, Bach Chopin, Rubenstein, lent some
fragments of their genius to him for inter-
pretation. Some of these demanded great poetic
insight, and they got it. Further, Mr. Morley’s
technique is gushed over even in Vienna. My
hearing several times went out of action through
my sight being concentrated on his hands. Morley
plays from the roots of his fingers with touch
light as the fall of dew yet strong as make
your own simile; and in one encore piece the
notes seemed to me to have resolved themselves
into creased flower petals (you have seen those
creases just when the flower gets out of its deli-
cate travelling - case) which the player was
smoothing out. Anon the notes turned to
spray, and he seemed to be keeping his fingers
from getting wet. Once his left hand trespassed
on the treble as if to shut the eyes of certain
fairies, then his right darted under the left’s wrist,
caught a little flying comet by its golden hair,
hurried it back and made it sing. There is the
singing quality ” in all F.B.M.’s music.
At nine o’clock the State Governor, Lady, Miss
and the Lton-jacketed boy arrived, and, after
they had heard the pianist in a musical trefoil,
the Governor sent his nice, collie-eyed private
secretary round for him, introduced him to his
family, congratulated him, and made kind in-
quiries.
His State Ex. baits certain vice-regal hooks
rather neatly. At the smoke-concert to the IICO
returned troopers, on Tuesday night, he sent for
Mr. Gende, the concert director, and said the
things that stroke the coating of self-love the
right way. Also, he sent for Col. Lasseter, shook
that gentleman’s sword hand, and complimented
him on winning all the lost battles in the
late war. At this concert, his Ex. heard
for the first time in Australia an Australian
recitation, by Mr. W. Walshe. “ How McDougall
Topped the Score ! ” Mr. Spencer, - the
writer was in the audience. The Governor
chortled quietly all through it; Major-General 5
X rench kept up a wide smile; Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan
iaughed outright, and Messrs. See, Lee, Fosbery
?' . B. u gl ,es looked as if they would like to
brain McDougall with Walsh’s bat and bury him
m the Spencer family vault. That fine child-
singer, Ada Batchelor, gave the soldiers “Home
i^ e ’ ” a P d g°t a genuine burst of applause!
Mrs. G. Harpers nice fair head was beautifully
dressed, but she deserved to have it bowed in
confusion for giving that frantic recitation,
Balaclava. ]So woman should recite battle-
pieces. She can’t wave her sword-arm, flourish
her bridle-hand, and dig her armed heel into the
supposititious flank of her imaginary war-horse as
the man person may. When speech-time came
the Governor statesmen and military leaders
mounted the platform. After His Ex’s one-minute
speech he swung out of the Christy Minscrel
crescent and sat down on the keys of the grand
dolphin He 18 a m ° St natural and Bkeable old
Hornsby, Wahroonga, Turramurra—these and
other settlements up Sydney North Shore line are
humming like a hive which is smoked on the bees’
Sunday--at-home. Cause—the proposal to build a
consumptive sanatorium up there in the pure air
and undiluted sunlight. Residents are holdino-
mdignation meetings ; building operations are at
a, standstill. Persons who intended to live up
there are waiting with their household idols
packed to see whether the phthisis colony is also
on the same move, and the settled inhabitants are
poing about saying “ Alas, poor worms ! we’ll be
infected. One honest up-the-liner confesses in
print that the majority of residents in these dis-
tricts are not of robust temperament and would
be the first to catch such an infectious disease
as consumption.” It is true that all the lungy
families between Lindfield and Hornsby are
coughing angry protests, but they won’t thank
one of their number for his confession. Some one
{with sound lungs) tried to bring Christianity
into the controversy, and was coldly reminded
tfiat tins matter was one of scieuce; so he re-
venged himself by quoting what an educated
Chinaman wrote lately : “ In Christendom, there
is everything but Christianity.” Then the others
began to talk hurriedly and admiringly about
an idea which the Minister for Works is
supposed to be hatching—the ereotion of a con-
sumptive sanatorium on the lower slope of Mt.
Kosciusko.
Up-the-liners are devoted to their line, and they
have all got gardens, and their houses are not
built Siamese-twin fashion or terraced. You may
* r n Q W c ners —men, at least—crossing on the
JN .S. ferry-boat by the parcels they carry—baskets
of victuals and young plants, trees and cuttings,
wrapped in sacking. Just now I notice it is lie
riyueur for them to carry fig-trees and baby cauli-
flower plants. It is inconvenient on this line, but
very lovely. You have the balsam of vine and
tree and loam and leaf, and you can hear singers
that would rather have a worm than a year with
Marches.*.. . When a liner balances up to me
shining eyes and whispers joyously
1 hev re up!” I know he doesn’t mean Con-
sols, but his daffodil bulbs. You can’t buy
anything fit to eat up there, hence when
locally you see a barrister, a briefed one
too, his brief bag looking very weighty in one
hand, a dress-basket of vegetables in the other, a
parcel tied round his waist, and a packet in straps
lu Vu? lou ? ; j 1 ~"y ou w iH know that he is a liner, and
that his wife has forgotten to order things by the
town store-carts. The houses are well-windowed
which means a good, level light, so you’ll never see
a line-woman come into town with her “trans-
formation ” tilted and showing more of one bump
of destructiveness on one side than the other or
one cheek pinker than its fellow. In most of the
Sydney and suburban houses one dresses—in the
day-time at least—by a feeble, squinting light.
The most exciting recent event in Hobart
society is the King’s Coronation present. The
affair has been engineered by the Van Dobsons
and other exclusive personages, and consists—the
common herd presumes—of a book of short stories,
maxims, etc., by Tasmanian authors. Who the
authors are is a mystery, as the Mercury job-office
kindly delayed the “elegant binding” till the last
minute—and inspection wasn’t invited. It is sup-
posed that the authors are mostly Van Dobsons
and so on. One literary person was asked to
write something— “ Anything , dear Mr. Brown,
would do. Dear Mr. Brown, a pressman who
swears, wrote: “ Self-advertisement is the first
law of feminine nature.” Which story may or may
not be true. J
The pure-merino families of the Osborne clan do
not run to elderly maiden or bachelorhood. There
ahvajs seems to be a man or a girl Osborne pre-
paring to march to wedding music and stand
under a white bell of flowers. Miss Mildred
Osborne, a daughter of Mr. Aleck Osborne,
marries Mr. Jessop, the cricketer, soon ; and a
son of the same father and a daughter of Mr.
Alfred Milson are announced to be engaged.
A memorial fountain to the memory of the late
well-beloved Dr. L. E. F. Neill has been erected
in the University sports ground and was unveiled
by the Chancellor last Saturday. The inscription
describes the late doctor as “ Scholar, Athlete and
Gentleman, ’ which is as true as anything ever
written.
Miss Alice Mack leaves by the Persic next week
to join her sister, Mrs. Creed (Louise Mack), in
London. She had a merry little send-off, and a
purse of sovereigns, given to her at the A.B.C.
last week. The Misses Ruth and Hope Mavne,
who have made creditable appearances on the
Australian stage, also go per Persic.
Vincent’s Annual Hospital Ball comes off
°, n Tuesday, July 22. If you attend this ball it
shall be counted unto you for righteousness. Hon.
Secs, are Mrs. Boesen and Miss Fannie Doyle.
Another most deserving charity, St. Margaret’s
Maternity Home, takes its annual ball on July
2.1; the State Governor will attend ; the Hon.
Secs, are Mrs. Tudgay, Misses Daly and Becket.
T , Tp r ,‘ I jUc y Gullett, eldest daughter of Sydney
JJ. l. s editor, has been appointed to the charge of
Brisbane Children’s Hospital. A committee of
women now manage that institution, and the
experiment of discarding all male assistance is
watched with interest. I hope it won’t degenerate
to a. Dr. Gullett brings the number
of ladies practising medicine in Brisbane to four.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent :
“Melba has taken ‘Myoora,’ the Robert
Harpers place at Toorak, for her Melb sojourn.
Mr. Harper is not in the best of health, so he and
ms liege-lady, having married off their only
daughter, mean to treat themselves to a peep at
Canada. The stars of the Harper and Mitchell clans
dispiay a tendency to cross one another’s orbits,
ihe Diva, as Nellie Mitchell, attended Presby-
terian Ladies College during Andrew Harper’s
head mastership, and when he rose to be Principal
of - P lum P- brown-eyed, auburn-haired
Mitchell sisters owned his scholastic sway.
Myoora is just across the road from Toorak Pres-
byterian Church. By birth and training the
famous singer is a true daughter of the Kirk.
-Local Presbyterians, however, don’t seem to have
started yet to work up a big Kirk boom ; perhaps
they reckon it isn’t necessary.
“Nothing colder or stiffer than Melbourne’s
leave-taking of the Countess, at Port Melbourne
pier, could be imagined. She had rejected public
farewell suggestions, so the public and Sassiety
let her alone. A posse of police guarded the
gangway to keep the crowd back. But there was
no crowd. Only a few political leaders and their
female following came to say farewell.
“It was a drab scene and gloomy. No one
dared pretend to be sorrowful; yet none dared to
be purely official. So gloom sate on the small
knot of uncertain farewellers. The Gov.-General,
with Wally at his elbow, skipped with but little of
his old sprightliness on deck at about quarter past
12, and handed his better half up after him. The
hand-shaking and ‘So sorry you’re going ’ plati-
tudes were hurried over by the Countess : in her
deep serious tones, she nervously repeated with
gramophone sameness, ‘ Thanks very much ’ to
each one. In five minutes the function was
over. The grey-clad excellency looked at
the great gaps yawning behind her little party,
her lips quivered, and tears swam in her eyes.
Many saw it, and, wondering, left with more
haste. It was a strange scene—the Governor-
General looking painfully embarrassed, Wally
helpless, the Countess suddenly saddened and
storm-shaken, the small Hope, hat in hand, follow-
ing with his eyes the funereal figures of the
departing politicians down the gangway. Then
the spell was broken, the Gov.-General touched
his wife’s hand, and suggested that the flowers
be taken to her cabin. All made the descent, and
only the Madden family, in tow of the ever-faith-
ful Selwyn Campbell, determined to wait to the
bitter end. The Chief Justice’s wife did not con-
ceal her disgust at the behaviour of the public and
of society. She told more than one of the
men making the precipitate departure that she
was ashamed—heartily ashamed—of Australia’s
treatment of the Countess.
“A little later came the complacent Clarkes
who searched the decks for the Countess, and
later were advised to descend and search in the
saloons for the party. This was some time before
the hour of the boat’s departure. Nor was their
farewell prolonged. They passed away, and then
Lord Hopetoun, with Wally, decamped, his Ex.
first shaking hands warmly with the three servants
despatched with his wife. Captain Corbet left
with him. Mrs. Corbet, who at the last moment
was desired to accompany the Countess, was on
Melbourne station at 12 o’clock, from Government
House, and caught the train to the Port in the
most casual way. She went straight below,
and did not appear even at the last,
when the Countess in her wonderfully softened
spirit took up her post at the deck’s side in soli-
tary gloom and waved to anyone who fluttered an
apathetic hand in her direction. It seemed a very
long time before the boat moved off, and the
Maddens bravely held the pier when all the rest
had deserted it. Young Hopetoun studied the
boats in the bay, and directed his snap-shotting
machine at objects that took his fancy. Only the
baby girl of Mrs. Corbet calling for ‘ Daddy ’ over
the ship’s side long after that gentleman had made
for town broke the awkward stillness.
“The sudden cards for two evening-parties at
the greater and lesser Guv’ment Houses for Coro-
nation jubilee have sent Society suddenly career-
ing all over the place for fresh chiffons. The
declaration that no fresh frocks were to be bought
this season was a bogie scare, and dress-builders
are being entreated to take orders for these two
functions. One happens on 26th, and t’other on
28th, and how can smart people possibly turn out
in the same frock for each ? So the needle-workers
are preparing to scoop in tea-money and over-
time pay this June.
“The hearty wife of George Turner has never
lost her old interest in the State Parliament, and
is far more frequently seen in those galleries,
where she fostered a love for politics, than in the
house where her stolid spouse works out his
Treasurer’s role. On Tuesday, when the dis-
passionate and thin-lipped leader of the Opposi-
tion made his feeble attack on the Peacock
Government, Mrs. Turner was a most interested
listener. She is a good friend of Alec.
Peacock, and likes to make him laugh, which is
surely a very fine test indeed of her friendship and
her iron nerves. And his full-bodied burgundy-
tinctured speech delighted her. In fact it took
the fancy of all the excited females in the gallery.
His pathetic appeal for himself after a thunder of
pealing apostrophes, excited some of the gallery-
listeners to hand-claps.
“Mrs. Irvine—a tall, young, very pretty Glass
of Fashion—was flushed with excitement all the
time of the debate. She followed her husband’s
pulseless speech with enchanted ears, and settled
down contentedly when Peacock rose for his
defence—the one soul present satisfied with the
Irvine oratory. In the Parliamentary dining-
rooms, where champagne flowed, and many smart
women brightened the view, Mrs. Irvine sat in
close consultation with her husband, and, child-
like, could scarcely eat with excitement. But
that interesting member sat like a carven image,
and was a striking contrast in granite to his pretty
wife s wonderful animation. When the numbers
were finally up, the women buzzed round Mrs.
Irvine with congratulations. She said, simply,
she was glad the Crisis was past. The wives of
State Premiers evidently still take such positions
seriously.
“ The latest drawing-room attraction among the
extra-smart set is ‘Follow the Man from Cook’s,’
which rollicking refrain is accompanied by a
steeplechase over the furniture—a much more
vigorous and dizzy canter than the very tame stage
affair in ‘ The Runaway Girl. ’ Special skirts and
‘bloomers’ are worn for this ‘turn,’ and the
Society man’s acquaintance with the fashion
of those furbelows is thereby considerably
strengthened. An evening party without
‘Cook’s’ high hurdle jumps is nowadays a
wretched frost.
“ ‘Orpheus and Eurydice,’done at St. Kilda
Town Hall in aid of some deserving charity by
amateurs (who also deserve charity in criticism)
was creditable enough and yet very laughable.
Modern young men, with their anyhow attitudes
and cropped, crude hair, look absurd in skirts.
Arthur Seymour, as ‘ Orpheus,’ wore, to begin
with, a decollete grey brocade, made in a school-
girly way. Then he went into babyish white-
muslin, with innocent red sash round his waist.
He looked a cross between a New Woman and
cyclist Bill Martin in petticoats. Mercury was an
overgrown, stepdaughtery critter in brownish
frock, his skirt reaching halfway between his
knees and ankles, his hair short and straight, his
neck and arms bare and sinewy. Hymen seemed
one of the most proper, prudish beings (they didn’t
look exactly either males or females) present, in
a long, high-necked gown of Presbyterian
blue. Aileen Buckley, as ‘Eurydice,’ looked
rather a nice little thing but didn’t make herself
heard, though she wasn't singular in that. Far
too much indistinct dialogue and too little singing
on hand. Air. Lightfoot, as Apollo, and Elva
Rogers, as the muse of ‘ erotic songs and poetry,’
provided welcome vocal relief. Unie Russell, as
Terpsichore, was pretty in classic white draperies,
her flaxen hair filleted with pale-blue, The
audience giggled at times when a young lady, as
the ‘ divinity of love,’ crossed the stage, showing
a sort of surprise streak of leg;, or sich. Governor
Clarke and party were cherished hospitably by
Robert Reid, a patron of the benefited charity.
“Herr Himmer drew as many almost as Glen’s
Hall would hold to hear his rendering of Schubert’s
‘ Songs of the Mill.’ Everyone seemed to enjoy
the performance, and no wonder. The lovely
little songs were treated with the greatest sym-
pathy and refinement. The vocalisrs voice is not
of the strongest, nowadays, but, as his German
chums are fond of saying: ‘Himmer certainly
doet know how to sing ! ’ Seems to me budding
tenors couldn’t do much better than sit at the feet
of a singer who handles his own voice so tenderly.
“Mrs. Henry Dobson, wife of the Tas. Senator,
has gone to England, and is commissioned to
write up the butter industry for ‘a leading daily.’
The lady is to take in Denmark on her tour, hence
the commission.
“ Ambitious Australians are so given to sighing
after the Old World, ‘ with its opportunities for
culture,’ &0., that it’s quite refreshing to hear
from gifted Portia Geach that, though she
enjoyed every minute of her four years’ art-study
in Europe, still, now that she’s back in this
‘crude Commonwealth ’ (to quote the Naicest re
the martyrdom of Saint Hopetoun), she feels just
as confident of progress in Art as she did next
door to the shrines of the ‘ Old Masters ’ and the
studios of the New. Australia’s remoteness from
‘ collections,’ tradition, and artistio helps generally
is, Miss Geach thinks, not without a gleam of
compensation for the artist, who is forced, in her
isolation, to original effort which might be dis-
couraged by too close study of the superior excel-
lences of others. If puppy is ever to swim, he
must learn to go in the water ; and he is apt to
shiver hopelessly in the shadow of the very big
dogs.
Writes my Brisbane correspondent:—
“The Chermsides are sweeping through their
official duties in Brisbane with the vigor of new
brooms, and seem to have been most carefully
coached and guarded from mistakes by Lady
Chermside’s brother, Capt. Webb, a, mild little
local military celebrity. Lady Chermside is a
pleasant-mannered, bright-faced woman, abso-
lutely devoid of ‘side,’ either in dress or con-
versation. The Governor is a careless, good-
natured soldier—a sort of ‘bluff King Hal’—who
is apt to be taken advantage of by the smart
‘society’ girls. He has already shaken hands
with the wurrukin’ man, sent his cheque, and
appeared at the annual May-day celebrations.
Unlike the Lamington donation for the same
object, this one has been retained and acknow-
ledged with thanks. There’s an interesting yarn
about how one young charmer wormed herself into
the Vice- Regal set by a ‘ bluff ’ that would have
done credit to a poker expert.
“ The most approved millinery of the hour revels
in broods of black or white birds at rest on white
felt brims, or clumps of violets on crinkly-edged
or undulating grey beaver shapes. The front of
the brim dips, and the back rears up in bank
fashion, as a support for a wall of flowers. In
consequence of the erratic development of the
brim, veils are greatly dispensed with, and the
home-made complexion valiantly faces the music.
“Melbourne matrons find it a saving of time,
toil, and carpet-wear, to do their entertaining in
the tea-rooms. Thej; can do it ever so much more
cheaply, make it a bigger success, and please the
guests just as well. Besides, town is so con-
venient, and the bustle and noise, and sounds, and
smells supply something of the sensations
most desired at a social corroboree. A
cheap string-band makes music. The at-
tendance of maids is perfect. No guest pines
unregarded for a third cup of tea or a fourth help-
ing of nut-cake. So the affair which once might
have been considered cheap and nasty is to-day
regarded as the most sensible and comfortable
arrangement. A plan, cousin-german to this, is
‘ flat ’ living—whole families quartered in a few
rooms, where simplicity ( i.e ., cheapness) is the
avowed order of existence.
“’Tis a pity that there are so few dances
planned for this coming season, for dance*tunes
were never more gay and jiggy than just now.
All the popular songs and musical comedies cut
up into most serviceable square-dance lengths,
and for round dances ‘Oh ! My Dolores,’ ‘Dorceu,’
and ‘The Lambeth Walk’ are still going strong.
‘Dolly Grey’ makes a ripping barn-dance, and
can you imagine any tune more fitted than ‘The
Man from Cooks ’ for the last and rowdiest figure
of the Lancers ? Why, it makes one inclined to
tuck up one’s ball-gown and skip over the very
seats of the mighty chaperones, & la Palotta and
Co. over the hurdles. ‘ The Honey-suckle and
the Bee ’ is also a grand-chain air of much liveli-
ness. Perhaps you noticed how tuneless the
streets were a year or two back when the war
scare was on ? The boys whistled nothing but
‘Soldiers of the Queen’ and that clanking lay,
‘ The Absent - minded Beggar ’ ? The whole
British Empire was dumb musically during the
first years of the Boer war, for no really pretty
popular airs came forth. ‘ Dolly Grey ’is Ameri-
can. To-day, however, the sound of whistling
never ceases, for the air is full of those songs that
the superior person turns his nose up at as—
aw—vulgah.
“To a provincial resident were born the other
day twins (boy and girl). One he (vide domestic-
column advt.) has christened Ping, and the other

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Late Queen Victoria’s birthday passed
without one word of mention from the great
Melbourne dailies.
The late baronet Dan Cooper’s father
started Australian life as a baker at the S.E.
corner of Park and George-street, Sydney, where
now stands an hotel.
Australia is now favored with the presence
of another “converted nun”—this time all the
way from Canada— who has come to sell her little
book and “rise up” Willy Riley of Kiama.
The consolations of a Governor-General !
A Melbourne pressman, calling on Lord Hopetoun
for an interview about the latter’s resignation,
found him reading Steele Rudd s On Uur
Selection.”
N.S.W. Lands Minister Crick, claimed by
the out-back banquetter as a native of one of the
Darling townships, was born at Overland Corner,
on the Murray, in S. A. His father was overland-
mail contractor.
Bananaland Governor Chermside promises
to be very popular from utter absence of side.
He was in great form at a Johnsonian Club shivoo
t’other night, and kept his end up with fried fish,
pork chops and mashed potatoes.
Maoriland Agent-General W. P. Reeves
lias, it is cabled, been presented at a Court levee.
This probably means that he has at last got into
the Court masquerade suit, which up to now his
Radical legs have so vigorously kicked against.
As Lieut.-Governor of the Commonwealth,
if is said that Lord Tennyson will soon quarter
himself in Government House, Sydney. Ihe
secret way in which he received the Lieut.-
Governorship gives reason to think of other
secrecies.
“Fax” : Let me correct a par. in B.
31/5/’O2. John Rounsevell was married four
times, the first two wives being sisters (maiden
name, Hart), and the last two also sisters—name
Coombs. W. B. Rounsevell is only step-brother
to the late John.
Of the 24 Labor members in the Federal
Parliament, 18 do not use tobacco. Of the others
three are very mild smokers, and the “habitual
is Parson Ronald. Melb. PAUNCH lived on the
“ baccy and beer ” jibe; now it hasn’t even a jibe
to bless itself with.
MELBOURNE’S BLIND MUSICIAN.
There is likely to be a slump in Australian
Governors. Hotham (Vic.) and Belmore (N.S.W.)
used to sell the cabbages grown in Govt. House
grounds. Perhaps history will repeat itself. Any-
how, good vegetables are much more essential,
than Governors just now.
Writes Mr. W. G. George :
Dear Bulletin. —It may interest your readers to learn
that Frank Hann has just returned to Edjudina after
a lother four months’ exploring trip through Lakes Way,
Rudall, Oarnagie and Wells to Laverton, then down the
east of Lake Carey to Linden. He has now gone east
again to Victoria Springs, and expects to turn up at
liulong at an early date. Pity he’s not a Groper. Had
he been one, his tracks would be marked well over the
map of W.A.
Some extraneous interest attaches to a
booklet of verses just published, emanating from
one John Bright, demised. The preface mentions
that Bright and his sister, Mrs. Lauder, both of
whose portraits are given, were intimate friends
of Adam Lindsay Gordon in S.A. Mrs. Lauder
long tended the graves of Gordon, at Brighton,
and of his child, Annie Lindsay Gordon, at
Ballarat. She planted the wattles on Gordon’s
grave, and every lover of his poems will acknow-
ledge that the tribute was peculiarly thoughtful

Governor Rawson and Governor Cherm-
side are salt-water rowing enthusiasts. That
should be good news to languishing aquatics.
Sydney, with all its advantages that way, has been
almost uniformly denied an aquatic Governor,
Duff being the only one in years.
Hopetoun wrote to ex-Premier Peacock,
“ I cannot let you go out of office without,” &c.,
&c. Example is contagious, and probably soon
Governors and Governors-General will so write to
every Minister who drops a portfolio. And why
not next to every M.P. and every Mayor and
alderman ?
Cardinal Newman goes in as a Saint’s
picture in St. Mary’s Cathedral, Woolloomooloo.
John Henry would kick at being called a saint,
anyhow ; but to be put in a window with the
cunning look and in the very loudest clothes
usually associated with window-saints would hurt
his artistic tastes. However, he is dead.
Apropos the recent death of N.S.W. ex-
District Court Judge Dowling. Vincent George
Dowling, for years editor of the long-since-defunct
Bell’s Life in London, referee of innumerable
old-time bare-knuckle battles, high authority on
pugilism generally, and whilom war corres-
pondent, was an uncle of the dead Judge’s.
W. M. Hughes and Richard Edwards,
M’s.H.R., are the Welsh duo in the Rep. variety-
show. The latter, like the little French milliner
mentioned by Joseph Surface, “could speak a
word of English ” when he landed in Victoria 40
years ago; afterwards he was able to say “no
indeed really,” and his subsequent progress in
English was dashing.
Mr. Sam Smith, who is now, as an assessor
of N.S.W. Arbitration Court, practically in the
position of a District Court Judge, remains also
Alderman Smith and Beaman’s Secretary Smith.
No one doubts his honest intentions, but wouldn’t
it be advisable, in view of his judicial functions,
for Mr. Smith to abandon all positions which can
involve him in any controversy ?
E. W. O’Sullivan (Admiral) and Dan
O’Connor (Vice-Admiral), of the N.S.W. fleet of
dust-barges, mud-punts and tugs, now ruffle it
out on the State yacht Victoria in gorgeous yacht-
ing uniforms. They even outshine the magnifi-
oence of Admiral Sam Hordern’s Squadron men,
whose suits can’t be bought at the Admiral’s
emporium under four guineas (ready-made), and are
adorned with buttons said to cost 255. a button.
J. G. Ward, pointed to by some as
Seddon’s successor, is a good R.C. If he becomes
Premier he will be the first R. C. in the position since
Weld, in 1864-5. Stafford, Fox, Hall, Atkinson,
Grey and Seddon were all Anglican ; Waterhouse
was of Methodist family, so also was Seddon, but
both joined “the church” as more respectable.
Vogel was a Jew ; and Ballance and Stout were
agnostics, though Stout goes to church now.
Samuel Stanton, trustee of S.A. State
Bank and successful farmer and landowner, who
died t’other day, aged 73, was fond of recount-
ing his early life experiences in England, and
contrasting them with Australian condi-
tions. “Father was a farm laborer, his
weekly average earnings not exceeding 7s.
When I was six my mother died, and six
months later I had to leave home and seek
my own livelihood. For eight years worked
for food and clothing, and then removed to
another parish, where for carting copper ore
and coals to and from a mine I received
£4 10s. for 12 months’ service. Here the
thought struck me that I was in a big world,
and I determined to rise. Became an ore-
dresser at 7s. per week, but had to pay
6s. for board and lodging. Next became
a * stem-boy ’ at 2s. per day, working 16 hours,
and then a wages-man. I was rising.” The
autobiographer left England for Australia in ’4B.
Once he unsuccessfully tried to enter S.A. Parlia-
ment, and consoled himself with the reflection
that—“ What was a loss to the district was a great
gain to myself.”
Labor members in last S.A. Assembly who
do not hold seats in the reconstructed House are
engineer Carpenter, miner Hooper, tanner Houri-
gan (dead), printer Hutchison, Roberts (gone
to the war as an officer), and blacksmith
Dick Wood. All but Roberts and
Hourigan were beaten at the polls.
The only Labor members in the new
Chamber are Archibald, Coneybeer,
Price (leader), M'Gillivray, and Ver-
ran. In the Council there are but
two members of the party —sailor
Guthrie and printer Kirkpatrick.
The house first occupied by Chief-
Justice Dowling on his arrival in Sydney
in 1828 still stands in Kent-st., and is num-
bered 529. It is inhabited by the superintendent
of the Sydney Soup-Kitchen and Night Refuge.
The Rev. Gladstone, late of Nathalia
(Vie.), the anti-drink, anti-dancing, anti-every-
thing parson, is having a cold time in Westralia
through his vigorous preaching of primitive cata-
comb Christianity. A parson should, above all
things, avoid being a John the Baptist sort of
person, or there will be but few Queen’s heads on
his collection-charger on Sundays.
Dr. Cockburn, ex-Agent-General of S.A.,
is spending most of his spare time, which means
nearly all his time, in delivering lantern lectures
or distributing prizes. He is, comparatively
speaking, a poor man, but he has dropped into the
vortex of the London whirlpool and has not
energy enough to swim out and return to the duller
spheres of Australian democracy.
Waxellency Madden’s father, who died in
Melbourne last month, followed the hounds
occasionally up to his 80th. year or thereabouts.
He was still a fairly vigorous citizen of 84 until
a short time before his death, so his sons—lrish;
born, like himself—may consider themselves quite
young men for the present. The C. J. has a
reasonable chance of strutting around Melbourne
for the next 30 years, and his bulkier brother,
Frank, will probably be opposing the Totalisator
when this generation of bookmakers lie moulder-
ing in their unhallowed graves.
FULL OF MEANING .
LADY NO. 1: “In actual fact you sold the poor man.”
LADY NO. 2 : “No, I didn’t. I gave him away.”
At a party given by Hobart lawyers in
honor of Adye Douglas’s 87tli birthday, Chief
Justice Dodds congratulated the veteran on still
being among them, and that he retained “his
vigorous intellect almost unimpaired.” The Tas.
C.J. is usually a careful speaker; but that
“almost” was surely a concession to truth hardly
called for under the circumstances.
“ Tattersall ” Adams seems now to be
about the largest individual owner of Hobart
property, and hardly a week passes without a big
purchase by him of leading businesses and sites in
the city. Of course, it wouldn’t take very much
money to buy all Hobart; but, all the same, the
speculator who invests largely in real estate there
can neither be very poor nor very timid.
One Australian State Education Minister
is an ex-oxen-conductor. “ Why should we spend
so much on education ?” he said. “Look at me.
I managed to get on without much education.” A
big official of his Dept, is the gentleman who, a
few years back, in a report, warned the Govt, of
the “danger of an educated proletariat.” Any
wonder that that State shows a high rate of
illiteracy!
Bishop Stone-Wigg is playing wild man of
the woods in London. Horrified, weak-chested
curates stare at the jawbone of the New Guinea
boy saved by the bishop from a cannibal feast.
But His Apron, according to the English papers,
also proclaims that there is not equal justice for
black and white in New Guinea, and says a, white
man may shoot a native for £5, whilea native who
shoots a white man is hanged.
Hori Grey preceded Ketchener by nearly
60 years as a builder of block-houses. When
Auckland was in danger of being wiped out by
the Maori warriors in the early 40’s, Gov. Grey
held back the threatened invasion by the erection
of a chain of little forts round the infant settle-
ment. He kept communication open between
Wellington and Wanganui during the Maori dis-
turbances by the same means.
Mr. Symon, K.C., Freetrade leader in the
Federal Senate, has had to drop the dictatorial
law-suit manners which he at first imported into
the debates. The atmosphere of the Senate, with
its strong radical element, was found altogether
different from that of a court with timid witnesses,
a jury that couldn’t talk back, and an obsequious
junior Bar. In a manner qf speaking Symon “is
coming to his cakes and milk.”
“ What has Sydney done with its soul ?”
enquires Pastor Dill Macky in the Watchman.
His reverence explains that the reason Sydney
Town-hall bells did not ring out enthusiastically
on S’African peace day, is that the Mayor is “a
Roman Catholic and presumably therefore a pro-
Boer.” Which, to those who know the “6'artholic
Mr. Hughes and the political affection ever dis-
played towards him by the Pope’s brigade, reads
very humorously indeed.
Furry manßorchgrevinck, traveller, school-
master surveyor, and self-advertiser, has become
a naturalised citizen of the U.S. Borchgrevinck’s
old motto was, “My country is wherever I do
well,” not a foolish motto or a new one by any
means, and it is probable he finds in the TJ.S. a
brisker spirit for Antarctic exploration than under
the British flag. He is a Norweigan, of an English
mother, and was for a while .on the staff of
Parkes’s ill-fated Forestry Department in Sydney.
The Pilot, a Sydney weekly, on Mr. R.
Colonna-Close, M.A., a Member of N.S.W. Bar :
On his mother’s side he is descended from the princely
Italian Colonnas of history, which no doubt accounts for
his manner, culture, and dark features, set upon broad
shoulders like a Graham or a Percy, to say nothing of
Lars Porsena, or a Sydney Junius.
The Pilot prints three columns of this sort of
thing—with a portrait of Mr. R. Colonna-Close
aforesaid, “gentleman, scholar, author, Federa-
tionist, barrister,” who it says “ has as counsel at
the Bar-
distinguished himself on the Common Law side like a
Brougham, with the fine oratory of a Copley-Lynd-
hurst.”
Sydney evidently holds some great unknowns.
Thomas the Unspeakable, whose back
name is Bent, bobs up as a member of the new
Irvine Ministry in Victoria. It is 21 years since
Bent was last requested to take a portfolio—he
was Commissioner of Railways in Bryan O’Logh-
len’s Cabinet in ’Bl. He is now 64 years old and
hails from Penrith (N.S.W.), which is an
anomaly, for Penrith is about a mile long and
one street broad, while Bent measures .practi-
cally the same each way, and _ the birth of
such a thick man in such a thin town looks
incongruous. The old boomster comes back to
be Minister for Railways, about which he prob-
ably knows as much as he knows about anything.
The unearthing of this old relic gives a quaint and
antiquated air to the Irvine Ministry.
One of Maonland’s
reputedly richest legis-
lators finds relaxation
from political toil, dur-
ing the Parliamentary
recess, in wandering
about the streets col-
lecting waste-paper,
bits of dropped coal and
firewood, stray horse-
shoes, and other uncon-
sidered but saleable
trifles left in the wake
of civilisation. It is in-
teresting t o see the
ancient politician jog,-
ging along with a big
bundle of rubbish under
his left arm and his
pockets bulging with
great masses of infected
and aged property
worth about sixpence a
ton all told.
State Premiers See
and Peacock had each
a most painful disap-
pointment t’other day.
To each of them came
from London a large
and most gorgeous en-
velope, blazoned with
armorial bearings and
inscribed “ King’s
Coronation,” and to
each arrived the thought that the hard heart of
Joseph of Brummagem had relented, and that
this was the long-desired “ invitation ” at last,
When the envelope was opened it contained an
invitation—from a pushing tradesman to visit his
place in London and see the new carriage that
some Duke was to ride in to the Coronation,
It was pleasant news for South Australians
to read, the other day, that the senior representa-
tive of a fine old sporting family, relieved 16 years
ago Q f the management of his estate, was
sufficiently recovered to justify a half-dozen of the
State’s leading medicos supporting a motion to
supersede the former court’s order. Judge
Bundey, a close personal friend of the family,
would not deal with the matter himself, as he was
invited to do; and the matter has to go to a
jury-
A firm of Sydney house and land agents
were the first in N.S.W. to hear by cable of the
deatb Q f Daniel Cooper, Sydney’s absentee
barorie t ( w ho got his title chiefly by moderate
Lancashire cotton-famine and Crimean war-
subscriptions). The incident is characteristic
of Cooperian ideas—business first. The new
baronet is in England, and will probably,
like the father, spend the rest of his life there,
supported in state on large rent rolls and the
unearned increment of blocks of Sydney and its
AFTER THE TOUR.
1ST. BACKBLOCKER : “ What did the representa-
tives think of Wirra Wurra for a site?”
2ND. DITTO (hopefully): “A lot. We gave 'em
a tea-fight and dance, and the fat chap with
the eye-glass said 'he felt satisfied that the
flourishing township of Wirra Wurra and
its vicinity abounded with perfect sights.’”
surroundings. Daniel, helped by a goodly inheri-
tance from his father, made the foundation of his
vast income in N.S. W. in less than 20 years. He
was a politician with a certain measure of com-
bativeness in him, but he never allowed fightiness
to get the better of his liking for a steady and
respectable billet such as that of Speaker or
Agent-General. He was a courtier in his way,
but was assessed in England as of the opposite
pole to Agent-General Saul Samuel. The new
baronet Cooper has spent tons of money in culti-
vating the acquaintance of the entourage of the
present King, to whom he is persona grata.
The United Typewriter and Supplies Co.,
one of the largest concerns manufacturing type-
writers, seems to be getting more of its share of
the world’s business. One of its machines, the
“Yost,” was favoured recently by the Indian
Government with an order for one hundred and
twenty machines. In addition to this their
Australian representative now reports the sale of
five hundred “ New Century ” Typewriters for use
on the Government Railways. An important
fact is that these two are record orders for the
world, and, what is more important in the eyes of
the Company, were obtained in competition with
all the leading makes. Australian buyers can
obtain both of these machines from the Company’s
office in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.*

“ THE AUSTRALIA ” is loftily situated ; from
its dome, the Pacific Ocean can be seen, and the
whole of Sydney.
To its favorable and airy position, “THE
AUSTRALIA ” adds every comfort and appoint-
ment. It is fireproof from tower to basement;
and an efficient staff patrols the building day and
night. It possesses the most elegant of drawing-
rooms, handsomely appointed dining-rooms, cosy
bar lounges and winter gardens. The system
and attendance of the hotel are unsurpassable.

“W.S,”: A curious institution is the
Sydney suburban swagman. He “works”
his “beat,” or “round,” starting from
Willoughby, where he lives in a tent or
cave. Sometimes he travels what is
known as the “single triangle”—
along Lane Cove-road to Hornsby,
thence to Parramatta, and thence
back, via Sydney, to his base of
operations. He is generally in
search of woodcutting, gardening,
and other odd jobs. The “double
triangle” man usually “works”
from Parramatta to Penrith.
Thence to Windsor, and back to the
“ Bridge Hotel,” Parramatta.
B. R. Wise tells the Age that between
15 and 20 millions of N.S.W. sheep have already
died in this drought; that all through the State
lambs’ throats are being cut to save their dams’
lives; and that it is expected there will be no
natural increase. In figures this means that while
N.S.W. started the year with 42,000,000 sheep,
which, in ordinary circumstances—allowing for
natural increase should have given at the
close of the year about 50,000,000 sheep,
the State will wind up the period with probably
not more than 20,000,000 sheep. Queensland is
in even a worse plight. At one N.S.W. station,
£2OOO a week has been spent for the last three
months in the purchase of wheat, maize, and hay
for food, the daily allowance being Jib. of hay
and Jib. of grain per sheep—obviously a starvation
allowance, just sufficient to keep the sheep alive.
Whether such expenditure is profitable depends
on the price of sheep and the term of the drought.
It is estimated that the sheep that live to
September will be worth from 20s. to 30s. a head.

Writes Ernest Pavene :
It was the final upheaval of the volcanic age that ruined
Australia and gave us the unprofitable waste of the
interior. That upheaval was clearly a work of superero-
gation on the part of the earth’s forces. The old original
Australia, before it got that unnecessary hoist out of the
sea, would have filled all requirements. We should,
though, have had no Port Jackson. Under a shallow sea
AUSTRALIA OF THE VOLCANIC AGE.
would have remained for ever all the goldfields of
Westralia. Under the same sea would have rested the
wide plains and prairies that by their luxuriant fertility
during good seasons have tempted men to invest their
fortunes in stocking them, only to die of blasted hopes
when the long procession of dry years brought desolation.
But what a country we should have had in exchange ;
with a coast-line dotted with harbours washed by a sea
whose force would be broken by islands and groups of
islands ! Fertile, beyond all present fertility, because the
climate would not be affected by a great expanse of arid
interior. The accompanying map in rude outline gives a
fair idea of what Australia must have been in size and
shape when her dead volcanoes were in a state of activity.
“Walric”: In the great North-West,
where grass is so scarce and bicycles have so ex-
tensively taken the place of horses, astonishing
burdens are carried by the machines. I have
known a load of 1031 b. (weighed at Inverell) to be
carried 1500 miles on a bicycle bV a miner from
Clermont (Q.).

One of the many forms of drought suffering:
Owing to the enormous distances between water,
the horse teams (bullocks are now impossible as
they would get stranded half way and die) con-
veying supplies to the melancholy out-back home-
steads, have to keep going, day and night, for
often three times 24 hours at a stretch. On
arrival at the water (save the mud) the men look
haggard enough in all conscience, but the distress
of the horses is horrible. Worse than the blasted
hopes of the fools who settled in the stricken-
country, worse than the enormous sums of money
lost for ever, is the dumb, mute look of suffering
on every animal which man’s greed has brought
there.

“ Yarrum ” : After a recent storm, I
gathered, on the southern side of the Kiama blow-
hole, amongst the seaweed, about a dozen sharks’
eggs. Quite unlike any other egg! Size and
shape of a Lisbon lemon, but pointed at both
ends; outer covering of smooth, black, leathery
substance. Most people fancy they are the fruit,
or pods, of the seaweed, and jump upon them,
whereupon they burst with a “pop,” smell
horribly, and get the plant, which has carried
them miles, a bad reputation. A Greek fisher-
man here, who knows all about sharks, tells me
the “cow-shark” lays 18
eggs in a season, and that
the eggs are “ great
eating.”
AN EVERY-DAY SCENE AT MUNGINDI
BORDER (Q.): GREASING A DROVER
AND HIS HORSE BEFORE CROSSING.
The Bulletin has received from Mr. W.
Rodier, Tambua station, Cobar, N.S.IV., a pam-
phlet setting forth the advantages of his plan of
dealing with the rabbit pest, by simply killing all
the does possible, while not interfering with the
bucks. The result of the disparity of sexes thus
created is, according to Mr. Rodier, that the
females are rendered sterile and ultimately
killed by the superabundance of males.
Satisfactory evidence is tendered that the plan
has, at all events, worked wonders on Mr, Rodier’s
own station.
“ Henpot : In view of the continuous
drought-destruotion of cattle in Australia bunny
bids fair to pass from a pest to a godsend. Even
in some parts of comparatively fertile Victoria the
rabbit trade is the chief means of livelihood for
the inhabitants. Rabbiters’ camps are dotted all
over the country, and on the roads you constantly
see rabbit-laden carts bound for the nearest rail-
way station (sometimes 30 or 40 miles distant). At
the sard stations piles of rabbit-crates, filled and
empty, bearing the names of innumerable firms,
indicate the growing dimensions of the trade. So
great is the rabbit business on some lines that the
trains continually run late, owing to time taken
loading up rabbits at stations.

“Never-Never”: Curiously enough, it
is this year the comparatively fertile Central
division of N.S.W. rather than the semi-
desert West which is racked by drought.
Certainly there are bad patches in the
West ; but generally speaking, that division
has plenty of feed—-it is short only of water. The
explanation is that last year was phenomenal out
there, and the much-reduced flocks have been
unable to eat down that remarkable growth of
grass (now, of course, dry), saltbush, etc.

A Queensland lady writes :
“ Ho H.” shows common sense (8., l/3/*O2) in advocat-
ing permission to the aborigines to have opium in
moderation. To anyone whohas had much to do with them,
or, as in present scribe’s case, has been dependent on them
for service, it is obvious that
in their present condition
either rum or opium is a
necessity. For several
generations they have
been on the down
grade, till now even
the young of them
have no strength,
and are old and
feeble before matur-
ity. Opium supplies
what Nature denies,
so why not let them
have it? It’s all
nonsense about the
degradation of the
habit ; and what
matter even if
it did deprave,
if it only
gives them
a respite
from the
misery of
liVin g?
The white
man has
brought them
to their present
condition, and as opium is the
one solace they crave, they
should have it, even if it does
shorten a miserable existence.
But the stuff sold to them by
the Chinese is a filthy decoc-
tion,_ made up for them
specially. If there could be
somebody at each station
authorised to supply the blacks
with a small quantity of pure
opium, they would have some-
thing to thank the white man
for. And if those people who
argue loudly against giving the
blacks opium want to under-
stand why they require it, or
some other “ misery-deadening
drug,” let them go into a camp
I 'f mixed blacks and ask a few
questions. They need hardly
do even that if their senses are
! airly keen. By-the-way, I’ve
been a bit staggered by Dr.
Roth’s book about the aborig-
ines. Thought I knew a lot
about the Australian black,
but if the particulars of thiir
manner of catching game arid
their wonderful industry in
several directions be true, then
this scribe has never seen lor
come within cooee of the aborig-
ine. It strikes me the nigger has
i 11 • . litis
, . been pulling the author’s leg, or else the latter
himself made suggestions as to their customs, and the
niggers have said “ U-i,” as they will to every mortal
suggestion you make. An example, one of many I could
mention: One night about eight o’clock, a young black-
fellow came to me and told me my husband had fallen off
his horse and was lying by the waterholes about nine
miles up. I knew little about the blacks at the time,
, e /act that Jacky demanded “two pannican
flour for his information might have warned
/ gave them, however, and another as a
bribe to him to get my horse up. Then leaving
my six-weeks-old baby with a kanaka woman, I promised
Jacky a bottle of rum if he would accompany me to
where my husband was. When we started I began :
Jacky, you think boss hurt?” “U-i; me think it
missus. ‘You think he dead, Jacky?” “U-i; me
b leve so, missus.” “ Jacky, you think, maybe, master
oniy asleep ? ” “ U-i; I think it that, missus.” “ You
think dingoes touch him, Jacky ? ” “My word, me think
it that, missus.” After a while I ask him again :
Jacky, you think boss drunk?” “U-i; missus, I
think it. “ You see bottle, Jacky?” “ U-i; me been
® ee _ ,FP?' fuissus.” “jTou think master fall off,
Jacky? My word, me b’leve that, missus," and so on
to the end of nine weary miles, when I found my better-
half comfortably composed under a spreading wallum-
bush, and no more hurt than I was. So, probably, Dr.
Roth has suggested a few of these wonderful trapping
operations, and the Jackies of the North have merely
said, U-i ;me been do it that way, boss.”

FOUR FRIENDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the work is done and the people are gone and the
voice and the nuisance end
I find it most pleasant to banish the Present with a smoke
and a minstrel friend.
Those friends the first of the volumes versed, those keen-
eyed, quick-eyed men
Who can do so much with that one right touch which is
proof of a poet’s pen.
Pate leads their feet to here and there, by many a bourne
they bide,
But their own true selves on my old book-shelves stand
firm at an old friend’s side.
And when I feel the yester-winds blow fresh as of yore
they blew,
When we swing through Life to the drum and fife and
the tune that we once marched to.
Then Gordon strong has signed the song brings back my
boyhood blithe,
For I take him down when I’d forget that mower’s cease*
less scythe.
I take him down and the striding brown goes sailing and
sailing along,
And the grey cheeks flush at the rattle and rush of his
“ sitting loosely ” song.
The cup he pours makes the blood run hot, nor gave
those grapes but wine,
For so fierce he stamped the fruit to juice that many a
bunch bled brine.
But sorrow—where is not sorrow? It’s shadow escapes,
what rhyme ?
E’en Ogilvie, the Troubadour, he laughs not all the time.
He’s off to the Bush to the air so rare that’s clinked from
snaffle and spurs,
To the Bush that Ogilvie’s lover is as sure as Ogilvie’s
hers.
He seems a careless caroller, with his lilt of the lover’s
lute,
A Gipsy free who shall flourish a Glee forthwith from his
generous flute.
How he sings of the joy of the girl and the boy, how the
bridle-touoh thrills through his hands !
—And yet how plain is the dusky vein in Will’s well-
woven strands.
But would you change for Hell-gate glare this room’s
soft-shaded light,
Would you tread the West’s arena-sand where the
gladiators fight;
Would you hear a stave of great gifts that gave the old
world’s wider ways,
When the camp-fires burned e’er the Fifties turned to our
narrower Nowadays.
Would you learn their lot in the God-forgot, where they’re
besting it, God knows how,
—Then read the lays that brought the bays to Lawson’s
sweating brow.
But here are Banjo’s bits of blood,—“They’re off I’’ and
“ Here they come 1 ”
—How bright the clustered silks shine out as they slip by
the river-gum.
Horse 1 horse 1 yes, of course it is horse,—a curse on
your canting cry,
Some books are bought for what’s called “ thought,” and
let who wants them buy.
Let some hold out their sieves for rain, let some teams
plough sea-sand,
Be I, when “ Banjo ” drops the flag, at the top of the
staring Stand.

Many Years of Rheumatism.
Crippled Boundary Rider Cured by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills.
The aches and stiffness of rheumatism affect
many sufferers severely at this season. That
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are a pleasant and
permanent cure for this disease has been demon-
strated time after time. A Singleton man—Mr.
Henry Grey, of George-street —thus tells how Dr.
Williams’ Pink Piils cured him of this painfully
common complaint. _ .
“I have lived in the Hunter River district,
said he, when interviewed, “for nearly fifty
years. For twenty-one years I was a boundary
rider, and went through all the hardships in-
separable from such a life, sometimes being
soaking wet day and night. Many years ago,
owing to this exposure, the first pains and stib-
ness of rheumatism came on me.”
“Were you ever confined to bed?’’asked the
reporter.
“Yes, on one occasion I was bed-ridden tor
nearly two-and-a-half months. The pain in my
joints and muscles was excruciating ; even the
slightest movement increased the agony. I got
little or no sleep and I lost my appetite. When
at last I rose from bed I had to take to my
crutches, but the aching pains still made me
miserable. When cold wind or weather came on
the agony increased, and my flesh swelled and
became so tender that I could not bear it to be
touched. Often I could neither lift nor use my
arms and hands through pain and stiffness.
When I tried to walk I staggered. Electric belts,
liniments, embrocations and internal medicines
were tried, but to no effect, and even the doctor s
treatment did not restore me.”
“ When did you try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills ?
was asked. - T , ,
“it was not till three years ago that 1 heard
of the marvellous cures they had performed in
cases of rheumatism. So I began taking them
without delay. The first and second boxfuls did
not benefit me much—my ailment was of such
long standing that I scarcely expected that they
would. But when I had taken two more boxes
the pains lessened greatly, my muscles became
pliable, and I could walk about steadily. A
little further continuance with Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills completely cured me, and now, although
lam fifty-six, I have regained my old strength
and activity. At all times I bear testimony to
the wonderful curative properties of Dr. Williams
Pink Pills, which I consider an unparalled remedy
for rheumatism and such diseases.”
It is by purifying and building up the blood
that rheumatism, sciatica and rheumatic gou£
can he cured, Physicians say that vitiated and
impoverished blood is the real cause of these
diseases. By their action on the blood and
nerves Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have cured
thousands of one-time sufferers who were afflicted
with anaemia, debility, neuralgia, St. Vitus’
dance, nervous exhaustion, skin diseases, rickets,
dyspepsia, etc. ’Write for illustrated booklet

A correspondent supplies the following: —A gentleman,
who keeps a number of fowls at his residence, had mixed

he gave up all hope of recovering the lost gem. The
other morning a member of his family, while eating an
egg, perceived a foreign substance, which upon closer
examination proved to be the missing diamond.

He sat squat on the
ground, nursing his
chin, and staring
straight before him,
chummering to him-
self, “ Eighty miles

nothin’ to eat for seven
days.” I stopped, fac-
ing him. “Hello,

asked him. “ I ain’t

for 45 hours, an’ I’m

swered, without lifting
his eyes. I dropped
sixpence in his hand —
“ Go and get a drink,”
I said. He gazed at
the coin for a moment,
and then said, “ Why,

The English Cabinet described in a few
words by “ Historicus,” in the Methodist : —
The ablest by far is Hr. Chamberlain. But he is badly
educated, appallingly ignorant on some matters. He
would make an ideal mayor for a provincial town, or
along with a really able statesman he would make an
admirable Imperial' Minister. He is wide-awake, hard-
working, and forceful, but his ignorance and his conceit
are great hindrances to success. Lord Salisbury is well
educated, with a large statesmanlike outlook, but he is
old, and he is dreadfully pessimistic. Mr. Balfour also
has a large outlook, but he is as lazy as Mr, Chamberlain
is ignorant.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-st., Melbourne, is the largest buyer of
Opals, Sapphires, Pearls and other Australian
gems, and consignors will find it to their advantage
to send their parcels direct to him. The firm has
a reputation for straight-dealing, extending over a
period of 40 years, which is a sufficient guarantee
that they will be honorably treated. A trial par-
cel, which will be followed by direct remittance,
is solicited.

When M.L. Bishop Selwyn was visiting
Melanesia, he once anchored near a British
whaler, and was allowed to make one of the crew
in a whale chase. As the boat neared a huge
“fish ” the men called out, “ Pull, bishop, puli.
But soon there were indications of the whale
“sounding’’ before the harpooner was within
striking distance, whereupon the excited whale
men changed it to —“ Pull, you ——, pull • The
prelate accepted the necessities of the position.
The S. Australian, when he wants to save
himself the trouble of thinking hard about what
is going to happen to him, and when it
isn’t his day for dreaming of other Moontas or
Burra-Burras turning up, drops on Our fertile
South-East.” But “the fertile South-East is &
fly-speck, after all; and even its fertility doesn t
amount to much. Last season only 28,320 acres of
it was under grain crop; the best of it yielded
1618 bushels to the acre, the worst 3’27 bushels,
and the average was 8'55. Even N.S.W., which
hasn’t a record to fuss about, averaged last year
10-6 bushels for its whole 1,389,434 acres under
wheat-crop.

Writes a Bulletin correspondent:
The weird ways of N.S.W. railway people! An engi-
neer, who had been some years on Sydney tramways,
voluntarily left the service, leaving a clean record behind
him, to accept a better position with a private firm. He
received a letter of recommendation from his chief, which
concluded with : “His conduct has been good, and he
leaves the service of his own accord. T other day, he
applied to the Department for a re-engagement, _ and
received the following extraordinary reply, enclosed in an
O HJ.S. envelope, which further bore the legend, la. to
pav ” - “ In reply to your application for employment, I
am directed by the Staff Committee to inform you that,
having resigned the position you previously held in the
Department, you are not eligible for re-employment.
And this in face of the fact that men who have
been dismissed for intemperance are frequently reinstated .
To pretend that a man shall incur a penalty for endeavor-
ing, by legitimate means, to better his circumstances,
smacks of petty tyranny.

Advt.
Aroos spotted Bent as a certainty for
the Irvino Bailway Minister. Tommy Bent, the
solid man, whose political tenacity no man can
understand.
C. A. Lee, leader of N.S.W. State Opoosi-
tion, launched three censure motions at the See
G-ovt. in one short year. And the last state of
tne lenterfaeld storekeeper is worse than his first.
In the first three months of this year 352
Italians landed in Westralia. At one Murchison
mine between 200 and 300 are employed. The
contract bosses are Italian, and English-speaking
is a disqualification in a workman.
Philp Govt. is reported to be hot on a re-
distribution scheme. One infallible result of a
Philp Govt, redistribution would be an intensi-
fying of the greatest evil in Q. politics, viz., the
undue preponderance of Brisbane in the Leg.
Assembly. Brisbane, that honey-combed centre
of peg-voters, is the unfailing bulwark of Boodle.
June (last month of the financial year) has
come round again, and with it the yearly hard
tunes in N.S.W. Govt. Departments. It is a
lucky branch that get s through May without ex-
hausting its annual vote, and none of them hope
to start the last month of the year with a shot in
the locker. The lot of the public creditor in a
hurry is never enviable. In June it is pitiable.
Poor old honorary Minister P. O. Fysh
teamed many things while trying to steer the '
Postal Estimates through the Souse of Beps.
Principally he learned that his duty was (1) to
give increased postal facilities ; (2) not to close
any existing post-offices even if they don’t pay,
and though other post-offices are almost next door;
(3) to raise the wages of underpaid employees ;
(4) to improve the position of overworked em-
ployees ; (5) to reduce postage rates ; and (6) to
make the post-offices pay—the deficit under State
management was £200,000 ; to reduce expenses, to
practise economy, to give everything to everybody,
and to put two quarts into a pint pot.
LIONS OF A SEASON.
“Mr. Seddon is known to have very little respect for Mr. Barton's luke-warm attitude in re sending con-
tingents, and the friendship of the two is not too cordial.”— MELB. PAPER.
When two lions roar along the shore
The first will vote the next a Boer.
Note how completely the old time-serving
political trickster, Gillies, has dropped out of Vic-
torian ] politics. In all the lobbying, even in the
making of lists of the new Ministry, he was com-
pletely ignored. Probably he will never see the
inside of another Parliament.
Victoria, partly at the instigation of the
Age, returned three very dubious Protectionists—
Sargood, Zeal and Fraser—to the Senate. Now
their votes are turning the scale in favor of Free-
trade at one division after another, and Victoria
begins to wish it had hung David Syine’s paper on
a gallows 40ft. high before the Federal election
“D.F.” : Is the national entity reallv a

national entity) should become practically extinct

Those Kyabram “reformers” who have
lately been shrieking for bread of different sorts
liave finally got a very indigestible rock thrown to
tnem. Peacocks reform proposals were 60 mem-
ers of Assembly, 30 of Council, and an extensive
democratisation of the great stumbling-block—the
House of Fat. Irvine offers 70 and 35, and that
c . om P ared with the Kyabramapoo-
tra s 46 and 23, is a very poor concession.
People wish to know why Australia wants
so obtrusively to lean over the side of the ship
when aristocracies and monarchies are talked of.
ilere is one of the reasons, from the Australian
otar of June 3 :
w e i firS * blrtbda . v which has come round for the Prince
k S '-V Ce hls lavesture (sic) with that time-honored
ha P p,l y synchronises wit* an event the announce-
L « hl i Cb . be s P° ken of in Lord Salisbury’s
phrase as glad tidings of great joy.”
Forty-five votes sufficed to defeat the Yic.
Ministry last week by a majority of 3, although a
tuli Mouse numbers 94 without counting the
Speaker. Four members were absent from Vic-
toria, one was ill a-bed, and two seats happened
to be vacant when Peacock took the knock. He
gained a couple of unavailing supporters from the"
Opposition side, one of them being Stanley, whose
admiration for the man with the Laugh is almost
grand in its simplicity.
A N. S. W. Premier who would suggest
some genuine use for the big Government House
in Macquarie-st. would deserve well of the people.
It has now been maintained some two years for
Lord Hopetoun, and tenanted some two months ;
and the financial arrangements of the Federal
Parliament will probably not permit the next
Governor-General to maintain its glory. The
issue is between keeping it untenanted at huge
expense and putting it to some use.
Queensland Laborites in the Federal
Parliament are using all their influence with their
party to get an Industrial Arbitration Bill made a
leading feature of the G-ovt.’s next-session pro-
gramme. The Federal Parliament may provide
for the settlement of disputes affecting two or more
States ; and that, the Queenslanders believe,
takes in the shearing troubles and most shipping
rows. From their local Parliament they expect
little —and will not be disappointed.
N.S.W. Public Service Board, which
started hearing the hundreds of appeals from its
regrading last September, at the rate of 20 appeals
per hour, has not yet published the results. In
three weeks time terminates the financial year
current, by which date all unappropriated votes
lapse and have to be re-voted by Parliament. The
Board must gazette the lists by then, or have a
discussion in the House on their non-appearance.
Naturally the Service thinks little of the Board.
‘ No man can be a logical Freetrader, and
consent to Government regulation of wages or
prices, or to day labor. Governmental interfer-
ence is as disastrous in one direction as the other.”
Bruce Smith in the Federal Parliament.
Federal Treasurer Turner will not get his
loan-bill through without a vigorous fight. The
opponents of the borrowing policy are organising
but it is likely that they will go down before the
roads and bridges ” crowd, who want postal
buildings, &c., for their constituents. This gang
would vote for the Govt, proposals even if it were
intended to steal the money.
THE DEFENCE OF THE COMMONWEALTH .
“If there be one question of supreme and paramount importance in regard to which indifference or delay
would he equally criminal, it is that of the defences of the Commonwealth.” —MELB. AGE.
. A quaint upshot of Irvine’s no-confidence
victory is the threat of Rich Landlord Williams—
the ex-Mildura storekeeper—to resign from the
Upper House and fight Irvine’s seat, on the
Kyabratn “ Reform ” programme. As this doesn’t
touch constitutional reform the 48 Rich Landlords
enthusiastically barrack for it. It would create a
pleasing precedent for a Premier to be defeated
on taking office, but the State would otherwise
advantage nothing, as both are hard-shell Tories.
London Times on the peace proclamation :
. . . the calm dignity and temper with which the
peoples of the Empire have passed through the greatest
ordeal England has undergone since the downfall of
Napoleon Bonaparte.
Ye gods! England, with half her present popu-
lation and resources, fought France for 19
years ; and the S’African 24 years’ war was against
a population of farmers numerically equal to about
half Sydney. Also, what about the Indian Mutiny
as a comparison ?
Sydney’s Sunday Mary Jane does not
approve of leaving the Boers their rifles :
To have the country full of armed Boers after the main
British army has departed, can hardly be regarded as a
peace precaution, and the loyalists of Natal and Oape
Colony will presumably have something to say abo i t it.
What about the loyalists of Australia ? Have not
they been posing as directors of the war, and did
not Chamberlain and others say that terms satis-
factory to Canada and Australia would be insisted
on?
The Freetrade Senators from Tasmania,
including rail-sitter Dobson, have tried hard all
along to “down” every protected industry except
hop-growing. Not a word of protest was heard from
them about the 6d, a lb. duty on hops. O’Connor’s
interjection of the single word “hops” when
Clemons was arguing for the reduction of the duty
on cleaned rice, t’other day, made Symon and his
satellites fairly snort. As O’Connor neatly put
it, there s “ a good deal of geographical Freetrade”
m the Senate.
William Shiels, who comes back to
Victorian politics as Premier Irvine’s henchman
will yet become known as the Second in
Command. He has been the disappointed person
who shoved on Munro, M'Lean and now Irvine,
with a brief spell of the Premiership in between'.
Almost everybody likes Shiels personally, and if
he could only sell half his vocabulary and buy a
spine with the proceeds he might be a man of note
even now. But Shiels’s back has all the bendable-
ness of a shop-walker’s.
The most demonstrative loyalist of Vic
Legislature is “Admiral” Vale, and it was
pleasing to see that little wisp of self-adulation
fall m badly when the Assembly was passing its
peace congratulations. “Don’t call it peace ”he
implored ; “what we should do is to congratulate
the King on the surrender of the Boers.” But
instead of the chorus of cheers the plaintive little
person expected, he was shoo’d into silence. Re-
freshing see that the ex-jingoes have some
limit to their capacity for self-deception.
The agitation for the removal of the duties
on fodder for the benefit of the starving west ”
is largely a Freetrade fake. It is solemnly
recorded by Sydney D.T. that, if the duties are
removed, hay can be landed from Argentina
at £3 17s. 6d. a ton ! But the freight alone would
be almost that. It is a cold truth that the
temporary removal of the duties probably wouldn’t
brmg 1000. tons of fodder to Australia, since
Maonland is bare of supplies and such bulky stuff
couldn t be profitably brought from America.
The wail of M‘Millan, M.H.R., that the im-
porters who diddle the Customs by incorrect entries
should not be prosecuted because it is merely a
mistake, the importer being a man who wouldn’t
wilfully diddle anybody, brought a very pertinent
rep y from Minister Kingston. What put his
back up, said Kingston, was that the mistakes
were always in the importer’s favour. He had
put up with this coincidence as long as he could
but at last it had made him feel tired and he had
started out to promote accuracy among importers.
Hall, M.H.R. (Tas.) has been telling his
constituents that his ideas of reform are (1)
abolition of Upper House, (2) ditto State Gover-
nor, (3) ditto Govt, feeding of newspapers by un-
necessary advts., free postage, etc. And, as was
to be expected, the daily papers, whose traditional
privileges are thus assailed, preserve a silence deep
enough to crush a much larger person than Hall,
M.H.R. Yet the newspapers of Syme or Davies
or Fairfax or of The Bulletin Co. have no more
right to free postage than Anybody and Co.’s rum
or gin.
Strange question—presumably ironical—
put on the notice-paper of the House of Reps,
by Brother O’Malley of the Hat
Whether the relationship between the Australian States
and the Imperial Government has been altered by federa-
tion, so that the State Premiers can no longer approach
the throne with requests for honors for deserving citizens.
If so, whether, in the event of the State Premiers send-
ing a list of citizens entitled to special distinctions, he
will, during the Coronation ceremonies, approach his
Majesty King Edward with a request for the ennoblement
of these gentlemen, thereby strengthening their patriot-
ism and .oyalty, and solidifying the bonds of Empire.
Said that R. R. Garrau was responsible
for the inclusion in the Federal Electoral law of
the weird Hare-brained system of voting, which
has now been quietly dropped. W. J. Lyne
confesses—
I never understood the system properly in details. If
I had had to explain them I would have made myself
familiar with them. I read Professor Nansen’s explana-
tions. I think that they only mystified me more.
Curious position for a Minister to admit that he
didn’t understand important proposals which he
tried to force upon the House.
Tas. Senator O’Keefe told the House the
other day that land-values in the potato end of the
island State had risen 25 per cent, since Federa-
tion gave the farmers a free mainland market.
JLasmania has this year had splendid crops of
potatoes in the north and apples in the south.
The mainland drought created a big demand, and
inter-State Freetrade did the rest. The “ re-
form ” movement in Tas. is being engineered by
the crowd that objects to a land-tax. Needless to
say, that crowd doesn’t particularly love out-
spoken Senators of the O’Keefe sort.
After all the oily conversation made by
Chamberlain about the necessity of consulting
“the colonies” hereafter on all great Imperial
matters the Boer peace was concluded without
even Lieut.-Col. Neild being asked to give an
opinion. Of course Australia doesn’t care a rap
about being consulted ; but it objects to Chamber*
lain taking it for such a fool as to believe he in-
tended consulting it. The theory that any lie,
however ill-constructed, is good enough for the
Australian intelligence, and any grease cheap
enough to anoint Australia with, is objectionable.
The full text of Premier Seddon’s speeches
in South Africa, in which he practically declared
that anybody who would be satisfied with any-
thing less than the unconditional surrender of the
Boers was a traitor, had just begun to appear in
the Maoriland papers, when news came that very
liberal terms had been granted to the Boers —
terms almost identical with those suggested in
that peace-petition which aroused the fury of all
good Maori grovellers. Seddon, of course, hastened
to approve—if Chamberlain cut his throat Seddon
would doubtless hasten to approve—but it is an
awkward situation none the less.
Arthur Glint writes :
“Gleuara’s” sneer at Peacock and co. (8., 31/5/’O2
would be very effective if it weren’t for a couple of facte
which that scribe seems to have overlooked. In the first
place, the owners of the boomed land mentioned by
“Glenara” are too much alive to their own interests to
dream of selling said land to Malleeites or any others unless
under direct State compulsion. In the second place,
there is no compulsory resumption clause in Vic. band
Act; and not until the Leg. Council is abolished, is there
likely to be. While this bar to progressive legislation
remains, why gird at decent democrats ? The democratic
politician can never be said to have had a fair trial while
the House of 48 Rich Landlords has the privilege to muti-
late or reject his measures. Anyway, with all his faults,
Peacock is a saint compared with some of the Judases,
who succeed him.
A Melbourne pressman writes :
Vic. State politics are in a condition of absolute con-
fusion, brought about by the shrieks of the two big Mel-
bourne dailies. When the history of the present hysteri-
cal “reform” agitation is written, it will be found that
it grew directly out of the rivalry between Argus and
Age. Competition between the two papers is very keen.
For five years past the Argus circulation has been going
up steadily, and it is now so big that David Syme is hunt-
ing about for means of keeping it within bounds. He hit
upon a series of'articles which he called “ Papers for the
People.” The Argus then took up the Kyabram pro-,
gramme, which had lain dormant for many months pre-.
viously. David saw that his rival stood a good chance of
improving its position with the producers, whom it has,
been assiduously cultivating lately, and he dropped his
articles and began to shout Kyabram too. In this way
both papers deserted their parties inside Parliament and
allied themselves with the silly mob outside. The result is
that party lines in the Leg. Assembly have practically been
obliterated, and the whole House is combining against its
enemies led by the papers. Naturally the parties do not
coalesce too well, and no one ktfows exactly where he is.

Thiki is probably no musical instrument so generally
discussed and so thoroughly enjoyed as the Pianola.
Entirely unknown in Australia three months ago, it has
bounded into popularity, accompanied by an enthusiasm
indicative of unusual arousing of public interest.
It has found its way into every quarter of the Globe,
and the enthusiasm is not confined to any class or pro-
fession. Musicians and Amateurs praise and buy the
Pianola.
What has caused this stirring of Public
and Professional interest?
The Pianola is the wonder as it is the triumph of
the Century, and marks a new era in Pianoforte
playing.
The Pianola has touched the keynote of an
Universal Need. Many people have music in their
souls, but few can spare the time to get it into their
fingers. Even those who devote their entire life to music
can only get a limited amount of it into their fingers.
The Pianola, with its delicate mechanism, sensitive
to the player's control, performs this part of the work,
leaving the player free to devote his whole time to
expression— that which makes a composition musical.
You are cordially Invited to visit our
Showrooms and seo the Pianola and
hear it played-or, If unable to call»
send for Catalogue.

.... BY ....
VITADATIO
Singleton, N.S.W., May 30,1901.
To Mr. S. A. PALMER—
Dear Sir,—My daughter has suffered with Lung Disease
since she was five years of age. She is now eleven and in
good health, thanks to your valuable medicine. After
trying a great many patent medicines, with varying
effect, I was persuaded to give VITADATIO a trial, and
the improvement in her condition was at once noticed by
Mrs. Porter and myself. My daughter has been a great
sufferer, and was given up by the doctors after breaking
a blood vessel, about three years ago, the medical man
remarking that she could not live through the winter,
but VITADATIO willed otherwise, as she is now well.
Three years ago she had a bad attack, when she frequently
spat up blood, so I immediately purchased a bottle of
your medicine, with the result that it completely cured
her. You can make any use of this testimonial, as l
would like to see other sufferers benefit by your appropri-
ately-named medicine —VITADATIO.
Yours truly,
WILLIAM PORTER,

NEWMAN, CHEMIST, 82 King-street, Sydney.
The Prohibitionists of Maoriland lately
girded up their loins and imported a Yankee
drink-slayer named Woolley. He was to rage
through the isles and set going an eruption of
public conscience beside which Tarawera’s famous
outburst would be a mere trifle. Woolley started
well, and the outlook was good, till someone dug
out a paper conducted by him in Chicago, which
was uncompromisingly against Chamberlain s war
policy. Then it was found that a lot of things he
nad said and written in Maoriland were disloyal
and pro-Boer, and the Cold Tea spouts arose as
one wet pump and repudiated him and all his
works. Woolley finds nimself out of a billet now
and the Temperance party is walking round with
feathers in its hair loudly declaring that it prefers
that a man should be drunk rather than that he
should disapprove of farm-burning. Truly,
Maoriland has got that Jingo disease very badly
indeed.

SHAVING
The chief danger in cutting yourself
when shaving arises from the germs
in the inferior, bad-smelling fats
used in making the Shaving Soaps.
The kind of fats we mean is such as
one smells in the vicinity of an
ordinary Soap Factory. The Vinolia Fat
yard smells as sweet as any kitchen
in England, and Vinolia Shaving Soap
is purest, safest, best —so that the
danger, if you should cut your face,
is nil.

“ What were you up for ? “ Desertion. (Laughter.)

“Oh; you were never up at all?’— An order was

There are many parallel cases. Yet, somehow, I cannot
work up sincere sympathy with this class of _ sweated
slaves. Many attempts have been made to organise clerks
into a union (Poet E. J. Brady had several hard tries), but
without success, because the 3in-collar young man mostly
scorns the idea of “ lowering ” himself to the level of
coal-lumpers and shearers, by joining a “ common union,
and voting for “ coarse, vulgar labor members. It would
be humorous were it not so pitiful. Were the clerks to
organise and bring some of the glaring cases of sweating
before the Arbitration Court things would quickly be
altered for the better. But until they borrow, steal, or
otherwise acquire common sense, and throw away their
silly conceit, anything is good enough for them 1

with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the Joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may he discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

Or Its tones can be modulated to the soft, sweet tones of the German Zither.
In addition to its wonderful tone quality, the Harp-Zither has a great many
advantages over all other Zithers. It is the only Zither which may be played
while holding vertically like the Harp, or it may be laid upon a table, as is
necessary with the ordinary Zither.
Observe the diagonally crossed strings, almost the same as in a piano, the
melody strings passing over the chord strings. By means of this improvement
in construction the similarity in tone and volume of the piano is produced.
Beautiful In Design, Grand, Resonant Tone, Perfection in Every Point,
and it is the easiest to learn to play of any musical instrument in existence.
A child can play it almost at sight. The reason anyone can play this instru-
ment on first trial, even though the person may know absolutely nothing
about music, or may not have an ear for music, is this : Each string is num-
bered, as is each note in the music, so all one has to do to render the most
difficult selections is to strike the strings as indicated by the numbers ; hmce
we guarantee that anyone able to read figures can learn to play.
The Harp-Zither is built on the lines of the large harp which sells at
£2O and upwards, and to the astonishment of all the Harp-Zither has the
x louder tone of the two ; in fact, its tone is similar to that of a piano.

As a parlor ornament, the instrument, with its classical outlines, is
unique. For the serenade, the musicale, or any class of entertainment, the
Harp-Zither excels all other instruments of its class. Its Deep, sympathetic
Tones Penetrate even those Insensible to the Charms of Music.

THE WORLD-FAMED DANISH
HERBALIST & BOTANIST,
PROPRIETOR OF THE
ALFALINE
HERBAL
REMEDIES
REGISTERED.
A FEW WORDS TO THE UNINITIATED.
PERSONAL AND PERTINENT. —Those who have not met Herr Rassmussen, and
who have not given his Alfaline Herbal Remedies a trial, may find it beneficial to become
acquainted with the good work which he has done in the interest of suffering humanity f t
the last twenty years.
ALONG BACK IN THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTIES
Ilerr Rassmussen introduced his now world-famed Alfaline Herbal Remedies to the Australian public at 547 George
Street, Svdney. Australia was then flooded with American importations and proprietary remedies, manufactured
by doubtful persons with assumed names and fictitious addresses, who took the people’s money without
responsibility, and very often without giving them fair value for same.
HERR RASSMUSSEN BROUGHT ABOUT A REVOLUTION
by straightforward and fair dealings with the public, offering to stake his reputation and future if his remedies
were not as efficacious as he claimed them to be, accepting all responsibility, and willing to abide by the people s
verdict. the HAPPY RESULT IS KNOWN TO EVERYONE.
Over twenty years have passed away, hundreds of remedies have come and gone—many of them were forced on
the public in numerous designing ways—thousands of pounds spent on advertising same with the assistance of the
world’s greatest experts in laying traps for the unwary; but the public would have none of them, and they have
disappeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning.
“THE ALFALINE REMEDIES EXCELL ALL OTHERS,”
and are well known to be more popular to-day than they have ever been. They have not only obtained but
have retained the goodwill and confidence of the Australian public, and have become famous throughout the
civilized world The first Sydney Office not only yet exists, but offices have been opened up for their sale at
Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Wellington, N.Z., and in West Australia at Perth, Fremantle, Kalgoorlie and
Boulder City, with Agencies throughout the world.
LET THE PUBLIC JUDGE FROM THE FOLLOWING:-
The Alfaline Remedies have held their own for over twenty years in Australia, and Herr Rassmussen has
been awarded the Parisian Acadamies’ Gold Medal and Diploma of Honour ; Gold Medal, Sydney, and several Silver
Medals: honourably mentioned in almost every newspaper in Australia; received many thousands of unsolicited
testimonials—every one of the originals open for inspection at his Offices. The Alfaline Remedies have never been
known to fail to cure in a single instance.
ARE THEY NOT WORTH A TRIAL?
if they are, why not try them to day 1 whv leave it till to-morrow and, perhaps, lose your chance and time ? No
order so small that it is not welcome; no order so large that it cannot be executed at once. If you first wish
evidence of the efficacy of the Alfaline Remedies,
SEND FOR HIS FREE BOOK,
and read what the experienced have to say, and what the Australian newspapers have to say— the double distilled
extracts from the Press speak for themselves.

REUTER’S LITTLE PILLS.
For all LIVER complaints-
At the Charters Towers sports held on the 26th
ult., Massey riders were placed in every event, scoring
every first prize except one.*
Sydney Telegraph (10th June) again
gives the show away:—
However opinions may differ on the question of ways
and means for minimising the effects of the drought, the
general belief is that a remission of the duties will not
relieve the pastoralists to any extent. This view is based
upon the knowledge that a considerable portion of
the oat crop in Maoriland has been damaged to
such an extent as to render it unfit for use
here. As far as maize is concerned, Maoriland is
considered to have very little, if any, surplus, and conse-
quently the moment the duties are taken off here Maori-
land will ask the equivalent value or nearly so. In the
Sydney market the price is 4s. 9d. ; in Maoriland it is 3s.
6d. f.0.b., that is equal to about 4s. c.i.f. If the duties
came off it is considered that Maoriland would at once
jump the price up 4§d. or 6d. per bushel, and tlje squat-
ters here would, of course, get no advantage. Wheat
in Maoriland is relatively as high as it is
here. But' for the reason that a considerable
lot of our wheat has heen damaged it might be
placed upon the market. With regard to securing sup-
plies from the outside world, it is pointed out that if the
duties were taken off wheat could be sent in largely, but
it would not reach here until September. If it came from
America or the Argentine, for instance, by the time
orders were placed and charters fixed, it would be fully
September, and by that time it would be of no use to the
starving stock.
Large holes begin to appear in that agitation for
the removal of the grain duties “in the interests
of starving stock.”
Pimples and Skin Diseases
Are more than disfigurements of the skin ; they
•■\n
*
are a handicap to the
young man, alike in
love and business. The
pimpled face looks dis-
sipated, and both mer-
chant and maiden look
at the unfortunate
fellow whose face is his
misfortune. An almost
certain cure for pimples
and other disfiguring
eruptions is found in
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. They purify the
blood,' cleanse the skin,
and build up the body
with sound, wholesome
flesh. Mr. A. Murray,
Albert Park, Vic., tells
us: —“I have suffered
for the last year or
more from sluggish liver
and indigestion. -for
which I have tried many
remedies, without ob-
taining any relief there-
from. The complaints
were most troublesome
and obstinate, and it
seemed as if I had to
take it as the inevitable,
until I tried Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, which
I did about three months
ago. After using two bottles, I feel quite well
again. I have also found them A 1 for purifying
the blood. I have suffered from pimply eruptions ;
but since using these pills the pimples have all
disappeared. They are a good medicine,' and
seem to benefit one in many ways, and I can
conscientiously give them a good word wherever
I go.” Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, are
a perfect blood purifier, and a positive cure for
biliousness, indigestion, constipation, headaches,
sallow complexion, liver and kidney troubles,
piles, pimples, boils and blotches, and for female
ailments. Sold by chemists and storekeepers,

on the whole. 6
■** * •
Of all the horses that suffered from accidental
interference or foul dealing in the Adelaide Cep race The
Victory now looks most like the unfortunate that ought
to ha\'e won. The sturdy, natty son of The Admiral and
lhe Ohs rmer (two particular pets of their breeder, Sam
Cook) started his S.A. successes by winning the
Leger. Then he ran into a place for the Goodwood
Handicap. A fortnight ago the improving l colt
humped 9.3 to the fore in the Parkside Stakes, a
furlong event, and last Saturday he scored the
Birthday Cup with B.U up. Because The Victory had
opened his credit account at Flemington by winning the
Standish Handicap (6 fur.) on New Year’s Day, punters
jumped to the conclusion that he was only a sprinter. As
a matter of fact, he stays gamely, and may, with good
luck, develop into a Cup horse next Spring. Anyway
the Caulfield Cup course should suit the handsome fellow.’
The Charmer in her day ran second for the C.C., and her
offspring, with Bobby Lewis in the saddle, may go one
better than that if the handicapper doesn’t crush him
The Victory covered the li miles, soft goin<r, in 2min*
39sec., with four lengths to spare. A really good per-
formance.
• » * •
That fine old lepper, Domino, now “in work”
at Flemington for hunting, was a top-notcher of the best
brand in his day. Caulfield G.N. ’Chase fell to him with
13.5 up, while he appropriated the Great Eastern event,
humping 12.10. Domino’s record shows 12 starts and 9
successes.
• * * *
Old Nansen, who has not shown much speed in
his previous attempts, was fast enough to win the
Jumpers Hat at the A.R.C. meeting last Saturday.
Nan beat a field of twelve, and paid the joyful dividend of
£22 7s. —another advt for the Tote.
•** . ,
The decline of the Steeplechase: At recent
A.J.C. gathering £3OO for two hurdle races attracted only
10 starters, and exactly a similar number lined up for two
’Chases, _to which £450 was devoted.. Only a couple
finished in each of two, three in a third, and four in the
fourth. Bay Eagle, a well-knit little gelding from Tas.
has monopolised the Steeples, picking up three in succes-
sion, with Sportsman mostly second. Sportsman is big
loosely-made, and clumsy-footed. Neither has much
pace, but both can jump like deer. Sportsman is the
quickest at clearing fences ; Bay Eagle moves fastest on
the flat. Last-named won,. May 10, with 11.1 up ; Satur-
day week he carried list, to‘the front, and following
Tuesday, though weighted with the steadier of 11.13, got
home easipr than on the previous occasions. Turf men
are just now marvelling as to what will stop him.

them Marib.vrnong Plate, Caulfield Stakes, V.R.C. Derby

Recently dead Victorian Mr. W. R. Virgoe
was a sportsman to the finger-tips. Following the hounds
as a youngster he had few equals in dash and nerve, and
was a mighty amateur ’chaser. During the early ’Bo’s he
was prominent on the turf as a successful horse-owner.
Chippenham, Marquis of Waterford, Hailstorm, Denmark,
Yaree, Skobeloff, and Dawdler were his. Was also a
top-notch liilliardist, and built up a great reputation

Yorkshire - Australia match opened Monday
last week wben the crowd (30,000) equalled that at Lord's
in 90. Cabled they raided the stands and pressed so
closely on playing space as to at times hamper fieldsmen
and retard progress. A similar condition of things once
prevailed at Lords, and the onlookers prevented Darling
from securing a catch off Jackson, and Jackson subse-
quently (and apparently deliberately) hit one into Dar-

the time, lauded the sportsman, but questioned the wis-

“bad Pitch. Yorkshire had three down for 48. Features
of the play were Trumper’s 38, which was good under
adverse conditions, while only four others of the side
notched double figures ; also the manner in which he
(Iruniper) is said to have punished the doyen of English
bowling on a wicket eminently suited to

15,000 people, when Yorks first innings’ score was increased
t 0 10 G a "d Australians only accumulated 23 in their
second. Six duck eggs showed on the scoring-sheets,
with Gregory (10) top contributor, and Trumper (7) next.
Hirst and Jackson wrought the havoc, gathering in 5 for
9 and 5 for 12 respectively. Yorkshire lost 5 wickets
putting together the necessary 50 in its second essay.
Lesson of the match is that, as abundantly demonstrated
ol \-u r fu lo T} 3 of : ca3ions > Australian bowling has little hope
with the English commodity on particularly bad wickets,
omce the secession of Turner and Ferris, Australia has
never had the glimmer of a chance against Eng-

bowlers, and the stronger side in that respect triumphed,

AI.G.U. against Australia in June, ’96, when five of the
last-named combination went down with “ blobs"
opposite their names. Yorkshire’s success wa3 the first
(this tour) against the Australians, though they had (up
to then) engaged in nine matches ; also, it is the smallest
total made by them so far, and the second lowest on
record for a team from this section, the absolute worst
being that 18 against M. 0.0. at Lords in ’9O.

piled 356 for 7 wickets. Maclaren, Tvldesley and' Barnes
were among the English side. Of Australians, Trumble,
Saunders and Noble looked on. Top scores were made by
Armstrong (87), Kelly (75), and Trumper (70). Match was
abandoned through rain. Australian achievements up to
then had Trumper top-15 innings for 723, an average of

against Cam bridge’Varsity'— wasentered uponMondavtl ■
week. In 99 each side notched 436 in its first innings
Apropos coincidences. Same tour Essex first innings
produced 144 exactly the figures of Australians’ second

this year to fine bowling by Trumble and Trumper.

The wretched English climate is playing the

Ca-bled personnel of England’s team for second test,
opening to-day, Thursday, is identical with that of first
test this tour, bar the Yorkshireman, Taylor, whosecounty
now supplies four reps. Though new to tests, Taylor has
shaped against Australia before; in ’99, for Oxford
Varsity, he notched a century and t’other day helped
considerably towards Australia’s downfall by doing well
on a bad wicket. His record last season for 42 innings
in first-class cricket was an aggregate of 1342, averaging
34 41 with the highest score 156 for Yorkshire
opposed to Hampshire. Latest is that there’s a big
likelihood of Trumble sporting flannel in this test, and
that skipper Darling’ has been indisposed.

According to Major Warded, themuch-maligned
and tabooed English professional willow-wielder visiting
Australia is not in it with his alleged “ amachaw ” brother
at the coin and joy. Lily-white section of Maclaren s
team had their passages, hotel, train and all other living
exs. paid by Melbourne 0.0., besides getting “ pirT-
money,” running into three figures per man, “to rw er
other calis.” “Pin-money” in connection with “other
calls is suggestive of patchouli expenses. Also the
cost of one well-known amateur’s complete outfit pr-or to
embarkation was debited to and paid by the MOO
English professionals got £3OO and exs., but Hayward and
Lilley closed on £4oo—special treatment claimed on the
grounds of high reputation. Then the pros, secured a
bonus of £25 per man while an additional sum of £‘>so
‘talent money” was distributed. The bringing of an
English cricket team to Australia is indeed a huge under-
taking. &

m„ l ? arry ,^ lus^rove ’ the business manager of the
90 Australian Eleven, denies—as “ ridiculous”—the alle-
gation that two of its members received only half shares
m the boodle allotments. Jack Worrall, the allegator
states that he got his information from one of the two
men who “ complained bitterly ”of the injustice. There
was no injustice if the men in question contracted to
work for half-pay. But why all this mystery as to names ?'
Who were the men, and why don’t they speak ?

The first match of the English cricket season was
notable for the batting of the famous old rival skippers—
W. G. Grace and Billy Murdoch. The two ex-champions
of England and Australia were playing for London
Gounty (at the Crystal Palace ground) against a weak
Surrey Eleven. In their second innings the veterans
scored 97 and 92 respectively, putting on 126 runs
between them during the 90min. they were together at
the wickets. At what does a first-class has-been cease
to be better than a second-class is, provided he keeps
himself from turning rusty? 1

- Th .e mighty deeds of old. In ’99, Rhodes (nlay-
V lr i.°‘ I ''[ ho , rnt ""’ 3 team ) lagged 9 Australian,
wickets for 24. Charlie Turner took 6 for 15 in a test on
Sydney Cricket Ground 15 years ago. Bowling best for
engagements between England and Australia belongs to
1 ougher and Hearne who, at Lords in ’96, were respec-
tively credited with 5 for nil, and 4 for 4.

Fourth and fifth rounds of Sydney Senior
Rugby were decided Tuesday and Saturday last week
Fourth round proved disastrous for Glebe (who till then,
had won every match) as North Sydney beat them 14 to
a , Baan ? al " notched their first success (against Eastern
Suburbs) by 11 to 10. Western Suburbs put ’Varsity
down 11 to 3 ; and Newtown drew with South Sydney
Saturday s results had the effect of altering the position
of every contending club. Prior to this round Glebe
(who tied Varsity last year for the premiership),
was level-pegging with Newtown, North Sydney bein '
a pomt away third. North Sydney now tops the
lot (/ points). Glebe, Varsity, Western Suburbs, and
Newtown (6 each) are all on one mark. Eastern Suburbs,
have dropped from fourth to sixth, and South Svdnev
has relieved Balmain of bottom position. This chana-e
came about through North Sydney downing Balmain 28 :
to 3, Western accounting for Eastern Suburbs (4 to nil)
Varsity defeating Newtown (10 to 6), and South Sydney’s
vanquishing of Glebe (10 to 7). Five of the eight contend-
ing combinations are in a bunch now, and the winning
team will certainly take some picking.

Fitzroy v. Carlton provided Melbourne’s foot-
ball world with a congenial sensation last Saturday.
M’Namara, the Carlton captain, got his nose broken in
the first quarter of the game and retired for surgical aid,
but the team being presently in danger of a rout, the
damaged warrior came out again to battle. Moreover,
he kicked a goal ere the day was out. The man who
hurls himself into the fray when his nose is freshly
broken deserves to escape disfigurement for life. Nature,
however, rarely makes allowances for heroic recklessness
where the fate of a nose is concerned.

English papers, generally, commend the action
of the Glasgow authorities in going on with the football
international after the stand collapsed. The fact is that
80,000 in a small space is a crowd that can only be
handled at all by the help of its own goodwill. Strange
as it seems, hardly any of them were aware that any
serious accident had occurred, and many of them had
come (literally) hundreds of miles to attend. Stop the
game suddenly, ten minutes after starting, and where are
you ? Entrance-money would vary from one shilling to
ten, and how to return it correctly ? It would not be
possible even to let the crowd know the cause of stopping,
and if but a fraction of them took it amiss, dozens more
lives might easily be lost in the scrimmage. At best,
thousands would make for the scene.of the accident, and
swarm all over the rescuers and the ambulances. The
players really had the worst of it, as their dressing-rooms,
&c., had to be used as hospitals, and the sights they saw
at half-time made most of them unfit to play afterwards.

Bantam-weight bruising bout at Sydney Golden
Gate A.O„ Saturday night, ’tween old timer “ Abe ”
Willis (now near 40) and hunky 19-. year-old lad Joe
Dempsey, of Westralia, resulted all one way—Willis’. It
was a thump on the point in round 7 that ended Dempsey’s
hopes. Abe skirled round the youngster in a manner
that completely bewildered him and rendered his opera-
tions ineffective and self-tiring. It was a refreshing
exposition of some of the now scarce methods taught by
Larry Foley, and acquired by him from Jem Mace—father
of the Foley, Jackson, Fitzsimmons, Jim Corbett, Griffo,
and George Dawson style of bash. Willis showed a confi-
dent vigor and quickness that were surprising, as ’tis
close on a dozen years since he fought the then world’s
top-rung bantam negro (George Dixon), at ’Frisco, for one
of the fattest purses ever put up. Not likely Willis will
shape again, as he explains he only came out this time
because Dempsey was challenging Australia and couldn’t
get a customer from among the young ’uns. Said
young ’uns, now that the measure of the Westerner’s
quality has been gauged, will probably rush him.

Ex-Broken Hill miner Mat Mitchie met Glebe
pug Rollo at Sydney Gaiety A. C. last week for £6O and
the “ gate.” Mitchie party thought it easy—takinga line
on what Rollo had shown before—but latter was never
really well previously. Offers of 2to 1 on the miner in-
duced some business. Rollo people could have scooped a
few hundred had they been game. Mitchie was never in
it once ; Rollo side-stepped and ducked fierce rushes as if
by machinery. By-and-bye offers shortened to evens,
and then 6t04 on Rollo. Twice, left uppercuts—nicely
timed and powerful—lifted Mitchie over to the horizontal,
where he studied the make of the roof for several seconds.
The whilom hewer of silver feinted a lot, which amused,
seeing that Rollo was the cleverer of the two; and to im-
press this on t’other chap he scored often off that indi-
vidual’s own baulking. At times the thing became
depressingly monotonous, and frequently one or two
blows comprised all the work done in a round. At the
close of the 20th 3min. referee Dawson gave the fight and
the money to Rollo, and the crowd applauded a just de-
cision. This is Mitchie’s second easy thorough beating ;
the first he got from Jack M'Gowan.

Alleged bantam champion png. of Australia,
Harry North, who, on his own showing, isn’t a bantam at
all for he never fought at the limit (Bst.), had a “ go ”
with Fred. Williams in Melbourne last week before a
sparse attendance. Both hit often, and neither hurt
much at any time. North’s chances to knock-out were
numerous, but he hadn’t the power. The fourth round
saw Williams in such a parlous plight that the referee
humanely stopped further scrapping and declared North
best—such as it was. Fact of so poor a hand at the busi-
ness being able to claim a “ championship ” and have his
pretensions recognised by some, indicates how low Aus-
tralia’s boxing standard has dropped.

Rowing scribes in Sydney have been at their
wits’end to explain N.S.W.’s frequent defeats in inter-
state 8-oar struggles. Some won’t concede that the
shutting out of manual labor men has anything to do
with it, and lay the blame on unsuitable water as com-
pared with that (the Yarra) available to Melbourne oars-
men ; also the diversity in N.S.W. methods. Victoria
gets back with the statement that this is so much bun-
kum, and that’s the truth. At least as good conditions
for oar rowing as the Yarra provides are to be had within
easy distance of Sydney. As for the other excuse, the
styles in vogue at Victoria’s three principal clubs are
worth referring to. “ Mercs’.” vigorous catch and hard
finish is perhaps “ Victorian style ’’—distinctly different
from Albert Park’s, which lacks energy in the catch, but
gets pace from the swing and leg drive. Then there’s
Ballarat’s solid drag, from which the spring and elasticity
of the “ Mercs.” and Albert Parks are almost com-
pletely absent, yet all of these are dubbed “Victorian
style ” because their exponents have proved successful.
Tlje truth of the thing is that in Victoria proper attention
is given to every part of the stroke. An authority says
all N.S.W. need do is grip firmly with a square blade, and
not send the slides back till they can be used to the best
advantage, shove the knees down hard, keeping the arms
straight on the pull until the hands are over the knees,
and then bring them smartly home to the chest. Shoot
the hands out again, and, after a steady slow swing
forward, catch once more without the slightest semblance
of a wait, and then they will row the proper style, which,
of course, is the best. It is suggested that the loss of
power with N.S.W. may come through oar blades not
entering and leaving squarely, or being insufficiently
immersed, or the forward motion of the slide is rushed
when near the front, checking the way of the boat, or
there is some slight (hardly perceptible) loss in catching
when forwa rd.

There’s a dearth of good youngsters among
Australia’s crack greyhounds, judging by the number of
victorious old dogs this season. Orange Cup, which filled
and attracted wide-spread interest, fell to a fifth season
dog in Lamplighter who had retired for a long time.
Megaphone, same age, secured Coburg Stakes at Moonee
Valley recently. Beeline is a third old timer that
succeeded lately. Coursing doesn’t seem to prosper much
in N.S W. Same old comparative few attend meetings,
same old toe-rag books (as a rule) ask for the odds both
ways or cramp the prices so much that a punter has no
hope. Same old “ firing up ”of hounds for one course,
which causes them to fall correspondingly flat in the next,
is allowed, and the same old stuffing of one to make
sure of another goes on among the certain few who can
descend to it, and is winked at by the National Coursing
Ass. officials spite of its smell in the betting. Anyhow, at
best, coursing is bad to bet on. Stick to favorites, lose
twice in six bets, and you’re out of pocket, back outsiders
and there’s no hope for you ; mix it and you’ll face ruin
early.

Amateur billiard supremacy tourney under
N.S.W. Sports Club ends this week. Tuesday, last week,
J. B. Belfield, an ex-premier, easily settled Hope, 500 to
149, making 1 an unfinished break of 156 with balls so placed
that another heap mignt have been piled up had it been
required. Belfield’s excels all prior breaks in Australian
amateur competitions, and is much above the highest
British figures under new rules. Condon got away with
anot her ex-champion in L. Spencer, who notched 457 to
t'other’s 500. Belfield heat ex-champion “.Mai” Spencer,
Thursday night, hy 500 —250. Winner’s best breaks were
87, 59, 31 (twice), and 30 ; 30 and 35 were Sp>encer’s
biggest lots. Holder of the title (Rumball) shaped for the
first time Friday, and opposed Condon. Once scores were
260—205 in favor of Rumball, then latter w nt away,
putting 240 together, while Condon only made 80. Full
figures were : Rumball 500, Condon 285. Winner made

M.L. crack hurdler G. W. Smith’s successful
jumping at Walton-on-Thames augurs well for the pros-

yards champion of this continent, was three-quarter of
last M.L. toe-ball team that visited Sydney, anil among
rep. players opposed to N.S W. in M.L. last season. He
has to his credit 15 2-5 for 120 yards hurdles, but the
Australian A.A.U. withholds endorsement. The Austra-
lasian best (16), however, belongs to Smith in common
with Batger (’92) and Holder (’97). American marvel
Kraenzlein is credited with having created 16 3-5 on grass,
in England, and 15 1-5 on cinders, in Yankeedom.

“Football”: Talk about hard luck! Just
before the first race, on Adelaide Cup-day, a man had a
fit in front of the Derby stand, and remained oblivious
till the race was over. Then he began to come round,
and presently he asked the policeman, who was looking
after him, “What’s Bayou’s number? I want to back
him.” Informed that Bayou had just won, and paid £2B
div., the unlucky one looked fora minute as though he
would have another fit, and then went sadly away to see
if he could pick the next ’un.

The Bushveldt Carbineers.
Lieut. Hannam in Defence.
1 ‘ Drunken carousals !! ” said Mr. Hannam, lateij-
Lieut, in the now notorious Bushveldt Carbineers
after a second ginger-ale, “Drunken carousals !!!
And Handcock was a teetotaller. Witton, Picton,
and myself wouldn’t take two whiskies within
four hours for a lot of money, and practically
don’t ‘drink’ at all. Morant was the only one
who was fond of a glass. And he could stand
liquor so well that all the whisky we had on the
Spelonken wouldn’t have given him one drunk a
week. ”
Hannam, a young, slender Queenslander, with
an engaging air of manly frankness, reached
Sydney by the Aurania, hot to say a word in
defence of two dead men and several much-
maligned living ones. And his first shock was to
read the flood of calumnies poured on the Bush-
veldt Carbineers (with the tolerance, if not at the
instigation, of people who knew the facts and
might have spoken the truth) by various Aus-
tralian soldiers and various English papers—tales
of rapine and sordid murders; of lootings and
hunting to death of young children, of drunken
crimes surrounded by circumstances of unimagin-
able atrocity—all the sins real, and many of the
sins imaginary, of an army cast upon one corps.
Interviewed by a Bulletin representative,
Hannam seemed to speak straightly and honestly.
Pointing to one paper, which accused Morant of
deliberately shooting two young children : “Now
that was my affair. It was in the out-district,
near Reuter’s, and I had only five men. I came
upon a Boer laager at night, and fired at it; two
children in the camp were mortally wounded.
When they were discovered one was dead ; the
other I did my utmost to save. The father
admitted that the tragedy was an accident purely,
and offered to make a statement to that effect to
the Court of Inquiry on the Carbineers at Peters-
burg, but he was not called upon. It was recog-
nised that I could not be blamed. The incident
was terrible, terrible —but an accident pure and
simple. Yet here is this paper representing it as
a deliberate murder of two children by Morant,
who hadn’t the remotest connection with it.”
“Morant, I can assure you, was, up to Captain
Hunt’s death, most humane. There was no
greater favorite among the Boer prisoners, men,
women and children. He used to himself bring
milk and comforts to the kiddies in the little
‘concentration camp’ at our fort, and would
allow the husbands who were held as prisoners
to visit their wives a couple of hours every
dav on parole. He treated the Boer women
like ‘Dutchesses’ —to use his own phrase. I
can recollect Hunt rousing on Morant for
bringing in a batch of prisoners. ‘I couldnt
shoot them,’ said Morant, and he protested even
against putting them in the barbed-wire com-
pound used as a gaol. ‘ They are hunters, he
urged, ‘splendid sports, good fellows I would go
with anywhere.’
“ I was one to help carry Morant to his grave.
The night before his death he sent his photo to
vour paper with a farewell message to his friends
in Australia. Handcock’s chief care was as to his
children, and we’ve made up a little collection for
them and hope to get a good sum.
“ Major Thomas, who noted as counsel for the
accused officers, worked for them heart and soul.
He thought the fate of Handcock especially
nitiful Perhaps some will laugh at this, but,
looking in the eyes of Death, one’s point of view
is different —Handcock, the morning of the execu-
tion, so moved was he by the tenderness of Major
Thomas, asked fiim, ‘ You won’t think it unmanly,
Major—but can, may I kiss you.’ That from
Handcock, rough diamond ”
Hannatn had to stop here for a moment.
“The Australian public,” he said later, “has
got a quite wrong idea of this affair. There were
atrocities committed by officers of the Carbineers,
as there were by many scores of other English and
Canadian officers ; but the tale is not by very,
very much as black as it has been painted. Read
the court-martial evidence : that tells the whole
truth. It is cruel that the dead should be
maligned, as they have been. As for the living,
Picton and Witton committed no crimes. Lenehan
was absolutely guiltless of the remotest connection
with any atrocity, and has been treated scan-
dalously. I intend to join in a demand for a full
inquiry. Let the truth come! That’s all we
want.”
Men oy the Aurania onng the startling news
that a reprieve for Morant and Handcock arrived
at Pretoria —12 hours late. Perhaps Germany
had been placated, the murdered missionary
Hesse having been discovered to be an English
subject. That the reprieve was issued seems to
be a fact, though an attempt by an officer to
obtain documentary proof was met by a threat of
what might be done to him under martial law.

If Taverner, included in the new Vic. Ministry, “was

expenditure of public money when he made a historical

the outlay was £253. Out of the £690, Taverner paul his
secretary’s salary and all travelling expens s. The
notion of Turner throwing Taverner overboard because
he cost the State £253 for a mission is decidedly funny,
considering that Turner’s jaunt to the Jubilee cost Vic-
toria a cool £1000, although he lived gauddj at the ex-

hinted that things are getting worse. I he patient
died from natural causes, but he happened to have
sustained considerable damages to his person, and
an inquisitive coroner wanted to loarn how these
arrived. Nobody seemed to know Several war-
ders said that they had been told that deceased
had been struck by other patients, and they had
actually seen him bleeding at the nose ; but it
didn’t occur to them to inquire how it came so, or
to put a stop to it. One warder said he had gone
to the length of reporting it to his senior, but that
was all. Apparently the senior was too tired or
overworked to pursue the ease. Another warder
declined to say that he had not seen a patient
struck by an attendant. Take it all round, the
niggardly treatment of its insane by Victoria
seems likely to provide some horrible disclosures
presently.

it is only a few years since .Brisbane
turned tne waters of the Brisbane River on to its
city water-taps, and it was as proud that day as
an Arrican king who has just inherited an
elephant’s tusk from bis rich uncle. When
the Brisbane River supply began, iL was re-
ported that it was good for G,000,000g;d. of
fresh, tnough rather dirty, water daily Brisbane
didn’t filter its river much, but took it as it came,
or thereaoouts. It was also announced that, with
additional mams, 12,000,000gal. a day could be
easily obtained— about as much as the huge city of
Liverpool enjoys. And now, so horribly transient
are things, it is reported that inside six months
Philp’s city may not be able to get one gallon a
day out of its Brisbane river—let alone 12,000,000;
and somebody may plant a promising crop of corn
in the bea of the Brisbane or the Bremer, and a
hug© condenser may be erected at Bulimba.
Condensed water tastes like fresh water with
grease and old belltoppers and dish-cloths boiled
in it. It never seems to have got quite cold, and
no liquor that can be mixed with it is calculated
to make it taste pleasant, yet several large Aus-
tralian towns may come down to it shortly.
Perhaps water may yet be brought us by steamer
from Tasmania.
Sydney Sunday Times says that
Botha and De la Rey should be invited to the Coronation,
and be given places in the procession. . . . Botha, JJe
Wet, De la Rev, and Steyn need never work for a 1 >ving

a fortune ledtdring, arid add to it by wtiling a book,
That, then, is thb Times’ estimate of tliei aspira-
tions of these immortal Harriots and patriots !
They would be flattered at an invitation tb par-
ticipate in the gaudy Imperial pageant which
is to form the funeral of the independence of their
beloved country! Verily, Heaven does allow
some weird creatures to run newspapers.
Benign Peace having once more driven from
South Africa the fearsome satellites of War, the ambassa
dors of reconciliation take up the parable. Among the
most beneficent of these ambassadors must be ranked
D.C.L. Whiskv, which, if judiciously partaken of by Boer
and British will help to banish bitterness and restore
good fellowship. For slaying the germs of races-hatred,
influenza, enteric fever, and all sorts of wickedness, how-
ever generated, there is not any like D.C.L.— -the \\ lusky
of the Wise—the Whisky of Peace—the Whisky of the
World.*
In almost every State in Australia at the
present time Supreme and minor-Court .fudges
are denouncing juries for bringing in what they
(the Judges) call “ wrong verdicts.” The Bul-
letin awaits with hope the day when a juror,
knowing his rights and his privileges, will resent
the insolence of some Judge’s remarks on a
verdict, and tell him firmly, and as politely as
possible, that the jury has the decision as to the
facts, and that any judicial traversing of that
decision is impudence which he, for one, won t
let pass without a protest. Some day a Judge
Docker or a Judge Heydon will run up against a
shock of that sort, and in retaliation will only
be able to 1mpotently gnash his teeth.
The artistic sense of the Commonwealth is
delighted by the grace of outline delineated by the new
erect form, straight front corset. The makers of that
best of corsets, the P.D., ever improving an improvement,
keep their artistic creation marching straight in the front
of all other makes. Its form is erect in the knowledge of
its supremacy. The artistic build of the P.D. has done so
much to gladden the heart of humanity that men, as well
as women, have come to regard it as a religion.*
The Hotel Australia has recently added another
comfort to the many already enjoyed by its visitors. A
Willans and Robins engine and dyhaffio have recently
been installed for the electric lighting plant of the hotel,
running noiselessly, and meeting with commendation
from everyone. Governor Rawson, by the way, made
“The Australia” his headquarters prior to occupying
Cranbrook, and Major-General Hutton stayed at “The
Australia ” during his recent time in Sydney.*

It is significant that the strongest distaste is shown by
the firing squads to the performance of their duty. One
man before execution asked to be allowed to shake hands
with the Commandant and with the firing-party. “ I am
a Christian,” he said, “ as well as a rebel.” He did so,
and one of the squad fainted. Scheepers asked not to be
shot by the town guard, and not to have his eyes ban-
daged, but to die facing the party. As he stood there, so
emaciated, awaiting the order to fire, one of the soldiers
was so affected that he vomited. A Free Stater was shot
for wearing kharki. He told the court that his uniform
was that of the Free State Artillery, and that the color,
which was like kharki, had been worn before kharki was
introduced into the British army. The officers hesitated,
but finally they sentenced him, as their orders were to
summarily execute those of the enemy wearing kharki.
He dug his own grave, under compulsion, wished not to
have his eyes bandaged, and one of the Australians who
shot him swooned.
This may help to explain why it was necessary to
send a British relief force to Ookiep, in Cape
Colony, where, at the beginning of the war, most
of the residents were neutral.

Dr. W. S. Bice, the well known New York Hernia
Specialist, sends a trial of his famous method FREE
TO ALL. Anyone can now cure themselves at
home without pain, danger, operation, or an hour's
loss of TIME FBOM WORK.
At the earnest request of British patrons, Dr. Rice
has opened Branch Offices at 9d Stonecutter St.,
London, E.C., and to the thousands upon thousands
of ruptured people who are torturing themselves
with bad trusses, and are in momentary danger of
death from strangulation, will send free to all a
trial of his famous method that has saved so many
lives and made so many men, women, and children
well and strong and permanently cured of bad Rup-
tures. Do not be backward about writing for the
FREE TRIAL. It will cost you nothing, and will
enable you to see how easily you can cure yourself
in a short time without losing an hour from work.
Dr. Rice is determined that every suffering man or
woman shall know the wonderful truth that Rupture
can be cured, and he therefore generously sends,
prepaid by post, his method absolutely free, and you
can make a trial of it. Remember that it is the
same method that Mr. Thomas Blay (whose picture
is given below) used ; and who can deny the truth
when it is put before them in so clear a light? It
most indeed, be welcome words to the afflicted*
:
WORDS OF PRAISE FROM Mr. BLAY.
No. 6, Eipley Terrace, Luddenden Foot,
W. S. Rice. April, 6,1901.
Dear Sir,—After using your treatment for three
months I fiDd myself cured of my Rupture, at the
age of 55. I had been ruptured for ten years.
I shall advise all people afflicted with this com-
plaint to use your treatment, as I know from
experience that it will cure permanently. You must
have a wonderful knowledge of rupture to fit one
so perfectly without seeing the rupture.
I am in good health now, something I have not
enjoyed for ten years before. You can use this
letter in any way you choose, and I hope It will
guide others to a perfect cure.—Yours truly,
T. BLAY.
There is absolutely no question about the curative
ability of this combined and perfected method. It
has stood the test of time; it has been through the fire
of critical cases; it has come out victorious in everv
curable instance. It has saved the child to a life of
independence; it has given the youth his natural
endowmentof health and strength to figbtthe batil6
oflife successfully; it has conquered the blight upon
old age and turned years of suffering into ending
days of joy and giadness. Whoever is Ruptured, or
knows a person suffering with Rupture, should keep
in mind the fact that in eighty per cent, of ail cases
there is a daily liability that before night they may
say good-bye to earthly things. Does not this fact
influence one to pause and consider whether they
are using their best efforts in the way a wise Creator
intended they should? And if the forethought, the
research,©and the painstaking effort of one who
invents and studies for the relief of others is placed
in our hands, is it not our duty to read and listen
patiently,that we may take advantage of that which
contributes to our earthly benefit ? ' *■

A MAGNIFICENT SHILLING BOOK.
The Institute’s
Medical Publications.
SINCE the inception of the FREEMAN and
WALLACE ELECTRO-MEDICAL and SUR-
GICAL INSTITUTE, Elizabeth and Bathurst Sts.,
SYDNEY, in the year 1890, medical publications, num-
bering over 50 large editions, and comprising a total of
500,000 medical volumes, have been issued at the otbces
of their publishers, and distributed to the Irsblll U 1-fcLi o
patients and public generally over the various territories
of Australasia. The first of these works was published
under the title of “RESCUED AT LAST, winch,
after running into several large editions, was replaced by
“CLINICAL EXPERIENCES,” in the year 1898.
Each year has seen a revised and enlarged version of this
famous work, the public demand for it being of so con-
tinuous a character that constant publication was
resorted to to ensure a direct supply. This is but one of
the many publishing items in the general cost of an
INSTITUTE which reaches a grand total of £100,009 in
assuring its usefulness and scientific completeness.
* * * *
The present volume of “ CLINICAL EXPERI-
ENCES ” is as elegant in appearance as it is useful in
contents, and is especially valuable to anyone residing
out of touch with their family doctor. Where medical
aid is unobtainable, that is where this valuable work
finds a place. No home in New South Wales, no home-
stead in Australia, should be without a copy. The fact
that it is given post - free to the public for OJN It
SHILLING IN STAMPS assures its entry into every
home. It is a whole Library of F acts, and worth a
POUND A PAGE to persons living in the far por-
tions of the Australian Empire, where a knowledge of
how to act in cases of sickness is indispensable.
Everyone should have a knowledge of sickness, and to
some extent be their own doctor. r lhen, in cases of ill-
ness, they would know how to act. Their proper tutor
is a GOOD MEDICAL WORK, sound in its advices,
and reliable in its information. Its presence in a home,
when the loved one is stricken down suddenly, means
perhaps the saving of that loved one’s life. Itis impos-
sible to guage the value of CLIISICAL LXPLItI-
EN r CES,” for it is a sterling authority upon all diseases,
and its advices upon hygiene make it indispensable to
everyone interested in a true standard of bodily health.

Contents of
“ Clinical Experiences.”
IriOß the instruction of the readers of these lines, it
1 may be said “CLINICAL EXPERIENCES,”
which was published in January, 1902, in a 20,000 edition

half-page medical illustrations, 24 full-page lithographs
of the interior and exterior of the Institute, 31 chapters
upon general diseases, full-page portraits of the
Specialists of the Institute, an Appendix, the literary
contents of which comprise 22 readable articles upon
various matters, a valuable list of 50 prescriptions for
household use, a collection of press notices from the most
notable journals of Australia, and a Medical Vocabulary
of 1000 words. This Appendix is also charmingly illus-
trated. Each chapter and article is represented in the
Index, so that readers can find any subject at a moment s
notice.
The first chapter, on ANATOMY, contains 44 de-
scriptive pages, profusely illustrated with 36 life-size
and lesser illustrations, instructive to anyone desirous ot
knowing the complex character of tnrnr being, ine
remaining chapters deal with diseases of the HEAKi,
BRAIN, SPINE, BLADDER, LIVER

the uses of the MICROSCOPE in DISEASE, FRAC-
TURES INFLUENCES of OLD AGE, FALSE
DELICACY, EXERCISE, BATHING, BLOOD
DISEASES, QUACKERY, CANCER, CONSUMP-

FEVERS, BURNS and SCALDS, WOUNDS, SICK
ROOMS and INVALIDS, POISONS and ANTI-

There has not been a more interesting
Australian book published for a long time than
“Bushman and Buccaneer”—giving the life and
writings of Harry Morant (“The Breaker”).
Every bushman will want to buy a copy for the
sake of the complete collection of “The Breaker’s”
verses which it contains. The book gives a photo-
graphic reproduction of the “ copy ” of Morant’s
last verses, written in gaol, and many illustrations,
from authentic photographs, of the Bushveldt

When is Mr. E., Hee-Haw Broughton,
M.L.A. going to bring before N.S.W. Parliament
the resolution passed by the Imperial Pug-pups,
Pink-eyed Rabbits and Italian-greyhounds
League calling for the hanging of Holman and
Griffith for daring to advocate before June the
term? of peace now so eagerly accepted by Mr.
Chamberlain ?
Edward Terry, who, as member for
Ryde and leader of “ the independent party ”
(consisting chiefly of himself), was the most
humorousincident of last N. S. W. Parliament, sadly
replied to a recent invitation to the laying of a
local foundation-stone:—
Mr. Terry is dead to the Ryde electorate. The ingrati-
tude of the electors killed him, so he cannot accept the
kind invitation of the Gladesville Volunteer Fire Brigade.
Mr. Terry is dreadfully rich, and his electorate
had a genial time whilst it returned him—so genial
that it was a matter of great surprise when he
was rejected. He used, for instance, to give an
annual picnic to all his constituents. Disgusted
at the defeat, he “gave up” politics, though a few
months before he had run for the Federal Senate,
and looked upon himself as a possible Premier.
The capable and energetic Mr. Potts, late
Victorian dairy expert, now secured for N.S.W.,
is a big, florid, jovial man. Was a chemist at
Euroa when he began hugging “ scientific dairy-
ing” to his heart as a hobby. Mrs. Potts, a
trained nurse before marriage, always goes to
hubby’s lectures “ to tell him now he got on,” and
strengthens his hands in every way. Mr. Potts’
father was head-master for years and years of
Rockhampton (Q.) boys’ State school.
Mr. John Warrington, well known through
his many years’ connection with Darlinghurst
Court, Sydney, sends to England his lately-
discovered curfew, or fire-cover. As a historical
curiosity it is likely to realise a good figure. Mr.
Warrington bought it years ago without knowing
what it was, and had been using it in his fowl-
house for setting hens. It presumably came to
Australia with the first settlers.
Joe Cook, M.H.R., wants the Common-
wealth to provide £lO,OOO yearly as prizes for
rifle-shooting—yet Cook is one of the members
who are shocked at the amount of money that is
being spent. When the Federal Government
decides to make every citizen have a rifle and
know how to shoot, it should make up the prize
fund out of the fines inflicted on the citizens who
don’t learn to shoot properly. The writer thinks
he remembers having heard somewhere that Holy
Joe Cook couldn’t hit a barn-door with the butt
end.

Everybody likes old Philip Fysh, but
when that kindly long - bearded gentleman
assured the House of Reps, that the Common-
wealth would lose £60,000 a year by abolishing
black labor in its inland mail service, and then
found that his notes had got mixed up, and that it
was the abolition of Tattersall that would cause
a loss of £60,000, it was impossible to avoid a
feeling that Honorary Minister Fysh is getting a
little out-of-date

The morning of life is the time of
abundance, profusion, strength, vigor,
growth. When the sun begins to sink,
when the mid lay of life is past, then
the hair begins to fade and the silvery
gray tells of approaching age.
Sunrise or sunset ? Which shall
your mirror say ? If the former, then
it is rich and dark hair, long and heavy
hair; if the latter, it is short and fall*
ing hair, thin and gray hair.
The choice is yours, —for
Ayer’s Hair Vigor
always restores color to gray hair,
stops falling of the hair, and makes
the hair grow long and heavy.
This is something you have been
looking for, isn’t it ? And it is some-
thing you can have confidence in, for
it is no experiment; people have been
using it for half a century. We do not
claim do everything, but we do
claim it is the best hair preparation
ever made.

The benefit given, at Melb. Majesty’s, to aid poor Tom
Kennedy in his hour of need, panned out close on £2OO,
and was smartly managed by good-natured Cliff Ferley.
This is the 15th ben. Ferley has pulled off to date.
Tom Kennedy survived his benefit matinee at Her
Majesty’s (Melb.) by five days only. The poor fellow had
been down with throat cancer for more weeks than he
looked likely to live days when last seen abroad—a shocking
caricature of his old self. Tom, who came to Australia
with the Kennedy Family of Scottish vocalists, was a
well-known agent for touring concert co’s until he settled
down in Melb. as a sort of general utility busybody. He
found a lot of congenial employment in managing the
Distressed Actors’ Fund, and looking after the people
Who drew money from it. He could always find time to
inquire into the merits of a claim for assistance, visit a
dying pensioner, or attend a funeral. A lot of people
still alive will speak kindly of Tom Kennedy, and he cer-
tainly had the good word of many who died before him.
Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew, the comedy sketch artists
from America, whom Rickards has just introduced at
Melb. Opera House, are respectively the son of “ old John
Drew ” (one time of the Australian stage) and the daugh-
ter of M’Kee Rankin.
Sydney concert-goers will be interested to learn of the
success, in London, as refined variety-singers, of Marion
and Clara Llewellyn, prominent, until two or three years
ago, on local platforms. Marion was a bird-like soprano,
with all the vocal facility that Madame Simonson could
impart to' her, and sister Clara had one of the finest con-
tralto voices ever turned out of Australia, but not an
ounce of expression. They were members of the quar-
tette that used to draw crowds to the Unitarian Church
on Sunday nights, in Pastor Walters’ heyday.
“S.S.": George Moore looks for a sort of dramatic
renaissance through the music hall, and judging by some
of the small comedy stuff we have been getting from
America, there would seem a reasonable hope of some-
thingof the kind happening in U.S. Mr. and Mrs Nawn
at Melb. Opera House are giving a bit of Irish life that is
delightful comedy, and not even caricature. The humor
is not overdrawn, but its absolute truth to character is as
highly appreciated by a Rickardian audience as the
broadest fooling. The little sketch is realistic and clever,
and from my view represents better art than anything
else stirring in Melb. theatres at time of writing.
The N.S.W. Govt.-tendered smoke “concert’’for Col.
Lassetter and his braves was directed by Nicholas J.
Gehde, for a consideration presumably. The bill provided
for the soldiers included “Sons of New Britannia”
(N. J. Gehde), “ Welcome Home ” (N. J. Gehde), Corona-
tion Song, “Our King” (N. J. Gehde). You can’t beat
the musical person for modesty.
Lilian Coomber, far and away the most pleasing
of the four Marguerites who appeared in “Faust”
with Musgrove’s opera eo., has turned her Australian
etigagement to account, although she was given very few
chances to show this country what she was made of. The
fair Lilian has been taken on as a principal in the Carl
Rosa co., which, by the way, has now included another
two of Wagner’s operas—“ Siegfried ” and “ Tristan ” —in
its ordinary touring repertoire. This means that
Musgrove will include one or both of those operas in his
next plan of Australian campaign. Musgrove worked on
the Carl Rosa co. lines in his last grand opera venture,
and found them very safe lines. The stately “ Lohen-
grin ” one night and tuneful “ Maritana” the next. An
English paper says : “Lovers of Wagner will be glad to
learn that his music-dramas are ‘ catching on.’ At the
same time ‘Maritana’ is invariably the best ‘house’of
the week in the average provincial town.” Musgrove
might have told the same tale if his co. had been better
suited to the light ballad operas. Australia, in its big
towns, is more musically advanced than Britain ; never-
theless, it has still a larger public for “ Maritana ’’and
“ Bohemian Girl ” than for “ Tannhauser ”
As to the size and holding capacity of the Royal and
Her (late) Majesty’s, an expert tells Tub Bulletin : “ The
superficial area of the stage is slightly in favor of the
Royal, which, though narrower, is very much deeper
than Her Majesty’s was. Moreover the Royal has a large
scene-dock and a good-sized property-room, both valu-
able adjuncts to a stage. Her Majesty’s had no scene-
dock and a small property-room only. As to the audi-
torium, the stalls of the Royal seat nearly 200 more than
did those of H.M. The d.c. at the Royal is the smaller of
the two by some 30 seats, but its one gallery equals in
size the two of H.M. There is not therefore much to
choose between the two houses, though H.M., owing to
the difference in price of the extra gallery, probably held
some £3O more.”
A well-known lady professional speaker t’other day ad-
dressed a courteous letter to Wagga Council asking for
its patronage of her lecture on “ Loving, courting and
marrying.” At once a representative of Bumbledom
jumped up and said that the letter should be returned to
the writer with a statement that the Council considered
it a piece of impertinence I That peace-petition has
much to answer for 1
“ Ben Hur,” in London, was delayed a little in opening
by the indisposition of the star performers from America—
the horses of the chariot-race scene. In this scene, Drury
Lane shows four teams, whereas Sydney showed but two.
The later scenes, in which there are miracles and visions
and things (records one paper), “ excited disgust, which
found very audible expression in hissing and booing.”
Mummers receive quaint messages at times and the
Bland Holt co. has its share. Mrs. B. is now quite
used to being offered by letter strange infants who have
manifested such intelligence that their parents are certain
they will make brilliant actors. On a late occasion the
letter was supplemented with a sum of money, as the
mother was aware that an actress, for some mysterious
reason, “ must hate children, and therefore must lie
placated by coin.” A gentle hint was given the other
day to the genial Bland by a galleryite who wrote that,
having observed that Mr. Holt always wore a new suit in
every play, he would like very much to know what he did
with the old ones. His curiosity is still unsatisfied.
Herbert Flemming and Friedman, two well-known
Australians, do well as a Firm in theatrical management
at Pretoria and Johannesburg, the Thespians being once
more in full blast. Their star actress is Beatrice Day, a
prodigious favorite. Janet Achurch is supposed to be
writing a treatise on the Binomial Theorem—or some-
thing.
Ellen Terry, now that she is admittedly too old for
some of the girl-parts (such as Marguerite and Olivia;
in Irving’s stock plays, begins to pine for the chance to
appear as Charles Surface in “ School for Scandal.” The
latest “ dream of her life ” is to put her 52-year-old limbs
into knee-breeches and chaff Sir Peter Teazle re “ the
little milliner” who is hiding behind the screen.
London Referee says : “ The wonderful success of the
young violinists, Ilerren Kubelik and Kocian, has excited
curiosity concerning the method of their teacher, Herr
Otto Sevcik, and Refereaders who play the violin may like
to know that he bases it on what he terms a semi-tone
system, wherein he says ‘ the semi-tones are produced on
all the strings with the same fingers, which results in the
beginner experiencing no difficulty in finding the inter-
vals on any string, and this materially helps towards pure
in f 'it'-Hnn.’ Now we know how to play like Herr
Kubelik."
The gallery at Melb. Opera House had some fun t’other
night at the expense of Jim and his girl, evidently from
the country, seated in the second row of the d.c., near
the stage. Jim’s arm hung loosely around the damsel’s
neck as a rule, but when he wanted to say something he
tightened his grasp, drew her head towards him, and
poured his eloquence into Jane’s ear, she being, appar-
ently, rather deaf. The gallery, of course, soon “spotted”
the artless pair, and began to chaff them. “ Pretty
Joey ! ” shouted a sportive god. This was the cue for a
general whistling of the words—“ Pret-ty Jo-ey 1” Then
a voice exhorted Jim to “ kiss ’er,” and by this time
everybody in the circle had perceived the joke,
bar Jim and his girl, and a merry old gent
seated next to the lady. Applause followed “ Kiss
’er,” whereupon the old gent, thinking that all
eyes were turned upon him for some reason or other,
stood up and bowed gravely to the jokers up above. Jim,
in happy unconsciousness of the truth, gave another
gentle tug at his partner’s head and whispered some
more. “My Gawd i why don’t yer kiss ’er ? ” shrieked a
wild, wanton deity. At this point the old gent took in
the situation and shifted his seat to a back row. After a
few more exclamations from the gallery, Jim understood
that he was the centre of attraction and cautiously with-
drew his arm from his friend. She seemed sorry to lose
it. Then the gods gave one final round of applause, and
the incident closed.
F. Barron Morley, the Australian pianist, is the son of
the organist of St. John’s, Darlinghurst. First intimation
that Mr. Morley, sen., had of his son’s genius was when
the boy, aged five, was sitting by him whilst he was play-
ing Bach’s great G Minor Fugue on the organ. He dis-
covered that the kiddie, who had had lessons, was turning
the music for him and could show him where to resume after
he had stopped in the middle of a bar. Morley, jun., has
command of a splendid technique, and at his concert last
week there was a big music-student element to watch
said _ technique and get inspiration from the strictly
classical programme. The artist has a seven months’
American tour ahead of him, but will give another con-
cert before he departs.

A schoolboy’s paragraph :
Two identities about the grounds of Brisbane Boys’
Grammar School are the old messenger, George, and the
head-master’s Hereford cow. I remarked to George one
day that the old cow was eating the lunch-papers. “ Oh,
that won’t harm her,” said he, and proceeded to tell me
how the quadruped’s predecessor had for years been given
to the same habit. One day, however, the “ head ”
informed George that the cow had eaten a “ Todhunter’s
'Euclid.’” George, who had observed the pain and
difficulty with which boys digested even a little of this
book, replied, “Then there’s no hope, sir—she’ll die."
And sure enough, Euclid killed her.
A very old swindle was lately revived in
Melbourne, when a weeping individual to whom
life had nothing more to offer came in and
arranged for the funeral of his only daughter, a
bright and beautiful girl whose departure had left
the home desolate. His grief was terrible, and
he paid the undertaker by cheque in advance,
took the change, and departed. The weeping
father always takes the change under such cir-
cumstances. The undertaker doesn’t take any-
thing, except an apoplectio fit when he finds the
cheque is no good.

Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
THE FAMIOIJS REMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain o
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption ha
never been known to exist where “ Coughs " have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient
and a Complete Cure is certain.

“ Dear Sir,—l enclose for your own private perusal

[if London, England, from which you will glean that
your medicine has been a perfect God send to a martyr to

it was.—Yours faithfully, .”
Extract from letter alluded to above
“You will be interested in hearing that I think the
Bronchitis Cure really excellent. I was very bad when it
arrived, and I immediately flew to it. That was last
Friday, and it has quite cured me. Dr. is very
nuch interested in it. He came yesterday, and carried
>ff the empty bottle to find out if he could get a full one
from a chemist who is in a large way here.”

rours, and never had a fit of coughing after taking the
Irst dose, and though I have had but two bottles I feel I
«n a different man, and the cough has vanished. You
nay depend upon my making known the efficacy' of your
vonderful remedy to anyone I see afflicted.

been engaged eight months by then. .. . Happy? You
don’t dream how happy. ... It is dear of you to love
me so-to pick little me out of a whole world of beautiful

My Child.—Would you be disappointed—very—if we
put off our wedding for a year ? I have made an unfor-
tunate spec, lately, and funds are deplorably low. Only
say the word, and I’ll never speculate again. I was so
sure of this one turning out well when I asked j'ou to
dome to me soon. The ticks are bad here, too, and Ive
lost a good many cattle through this plague alone. Alto-
gether the year does not promise to be a very brilliant
one. 1 shall run down at Easter, whatever happens ; I
am hungry for a sight of my little girl’s face. Let us fix
.tmr wedding for May of next year. That will be some-
thing definite to look forward to. I say with Traddles,

the flowers that next May they’ll not have me. lam
ticking the months off the calendar, and I celebrate the
exit of each month by having a dear little bottle of port
wine for supper, the last night of the month; and the
mater and the girls join me in my room, and we do talk
nonsense 1 . . . My dearest, I am glad you think me
prettv. I remember one night this last Easter when you
were down—l remember we had been two dreadful spoons
all day ; and when I went to my room that night and
looked in the glass I was all flushed and my eyes were
shining, and I said: “Oh! but you are pretty, my
child,” and I patted the reflection on its flushed face. I
think that was the only time, dear. And then, you see,
it was you who had made mo so ! Ah ! but you are a
perfect lover, dear boy. . . My lover ! . . . But I shall
be gladdest when it is—my husband.
From Him to Her.

delay things—and postpone our wedding for another

reef, like a rich sleeve of sepia, curved tenderly round the
sea and kept it placid and serene. The waters washed
musically over the flat pebbles, just as they did that time
when their music harmonised with the dearest voice in
the world—and the two have been associated with each
other ever since. It was all so full of you—that was why
I wanted to see it all once more before. . . . The post
has just come. ’Seuse me a few minutes, dear boy,

From Him to Her.
March 17th, 1902.
It is twilight ; you are in my arms, and my face is
hidden in your hair ;—else I could not be telling you
this . . .
Child, I have waited till the last minute ; but now the
time of our wet season is past—and not one drop of
rain ! . . . You—you frail little thing—must have com-
forts and luxuries ; and, dear, I cannot give them to you
if we get married now—l have nothing, nothing ! . . . I
have tried, my child, I have indeed, but it is no use. . . .
We wi 1 not fix any date this time ;—we wi]l only say that
when the rains come, and things brighten, then, My
Dearest, I shall come for you. ... If it were not that
gold hair does not turn gray—but only softly into
silver when one grows old—the gray would be peeping
here and there in your hair now. . . . Oh, little one, just
sit down and write me one of your dearest letters —one
that will make me look forward again. . . . Don’t you
realise, child, that the most perfect woman in the world
is waiting . . . waiting? . . .
From Her to Him.
I have read your letter, and now I shall finish mine. . . .
I am really in your arms, dear one, and my fingers are
running through your hair. ’Member ? ... In spite of
. what you say, I am, going to look forward to a definite
wedding-day. . . . No—you’re not to know when ! Just
wait and see ! I’m sure something beautiful’s going to
happen—quite, quite sure.
It is nearly time for the mail to close. . . . Wait whilst
I go into the garden and pick all the violet-buds. I—l
couldn’t bear to see them break into full bloom now. . . .
There ! They are for you. . . . Little sweet promises
of purple! Oh, dear! blots, blots and smudges! .. .
Fancy the dew being on them at three o’clock in the
afternoon ! . . . But they were tucked away so snugly
under their leaves, you know, away from the sun.
Q.
THE SHADOW.
At Cunninghame (Vic.) State-school re-
cently the headmaster had to enforce discipline
a d geography on 150 urchins “on his own” for
a fortnight. Also, he and his pupil-teacher had
to do without the “assistant” (on sick-leave) for
nine weeks. Nobody took the latter’s place.
Reason—a dearth of male-teachers, owing to the
mean economy of the department.
Genial Harry Foster, Vic. M.L.A. just
dead, divided with oppositionist E. H. Cameron,
chairman of the Railways Committee, the distinc-
tion of being the cutest “ whip ” in the Assembly.
When Mines Minister under Turner, he was
always counted on to bring more reliable informa-
tion into camp than the regular party scouts were
able to glean, and whenever Premier Peacock found
himself beset, liis first call was for Foster. By a
strange irony it was the Convention bill, for
which Peacock was even then carving the grave-
stone, that indirectly had much to do with
Foster’s demise. He was lying sick, but was so
keenly anxious to votu with his party at the
empty second reading mummery that when a pair
was refused, he turned out of bed at midnight and
was whirled off to the House in a cab. His entry
to the chamber ou that occasion was probably the
most dramatic moment of his life, as it was the
signal for stonewalling speeches to end, and all
sides joined in cheering the muffled and foolhardy
party-legislator.
The Cry of the Chiefs Child.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Entering the harbor of Jokai, on the north side
of the island of Ponape, one sees to the right an
immense grey rock—the Paipalap —with a per-
pendicular face 800 feet high towards the sea, the
waters of which break against the foot of the
precipice. On the top of this rock, and on the
verge of the cliff, is a level space some twenty
yards square, which is reached by a steep, winding
path from the inland side.
From this spot a magnificent view is obtained
of the whole northern part of the main island, with
the beautiful islets of Langa, Parram, and Mants,
and their encircling coral reefs to the eastward;
far to the westward the little atoll of Pakin just
shows its tree-tops above the waves : to the north-
ward extends the vast ocean with its ever-
changing lights and shadows; and to the south
the deep coolness of the valleys and the long
ascending slopes of the thiokly-foliaged spurs up
to the central peaks 3000 feet above the sea.
Here are no mosquitoes or sandflies, and the
fresh trade-wind cools the air; so it was a favorite
resort of Lap-en-Paliker.
He was the chief of a tribe over which he exer-
cised the most despotic control. His people were
noted, even on Ponape, for their turbulence and
savagery, but the boldest warrior among theha all
trembled when Lap-en-Paliker spoke.
• * * *
Lap-en-Paliker was well provided in the matter
of consorts ; partly from inclination, partly from
policy. He had at various times in his long life
taken to wife the daughters, the sisters and the
widows of chiefs and landowners of neighboring
One woman had, however, come looked
upon as his principal wife, or “ Nanep.” She was
the daughter of a chief as powerful as her hus-
band, and of far higher lineage, for she was of that
ancient family of Ronkiti that counts as its
ancestor the champion Nanjau-en-Chapat, who
long ago defeated the invading fleet from Pulowat
in the pass of Nalap with such slaughter that
the battle was called Kam-en-Pake (The Sharks
Feast). ,
This woman had borne to the chief a son, at the
time in question some four or five years of age,
who was looked upon as his father’s heir, though
his youngest child ; for rank in Micronesia, as m
Polynesia, comes from the side of the mother
rather than of the father.
One day the old chief, on a canoe-voyage to
Mants, saw there a young, light-skinned Pingelap
woman, who took his fancy. She was of low rank,
and his simple command to follow, him was all that
was needed. He took her with him to Jokai, and
installed her in a house near his own.
• * • •
A day or two afterwards he went with the
Nanep and her son, the new mistress, and. half-a-
dozen attendants up the steep path to the plat-
form on top of the rock. Food was brought, and
a “ kamaik ” —a fish sacred to the use of chiefs
only—was placed before him. He separated it
into pieces and gave the head —the chief’s portion
always among Pacific Islanders —to the Pingelap
woman. The Nanep, who, so far, had not dared to
express any resentment at the advent of the mis-
tress-thinking that, as had happened before, the
chief would soon tire of the uqw face felt the
blood of all her ancestors boil in her veins at the
deadly insult to herself and her family, and she
said, rising to her feet and catching up a small
dog, the favorite of the boy, “If you prefer that
slave and daughter of slaves to us, I will throw
this our pet over the cliff.” The chief’s jaw set
and his eye blazed at the defiance, but he said
quietly, “ Do it, then.”
She moved a step towards the edge and cast the
poor brute out.
* • • •
The enraged woman looked, no doubt, for some
word or action from her husband, but he sat
motionless with fury darting from his eye.
Grasping her son, who on seeing the fate of his
pet had run to his mother’s side, she waited for a
moment to see what the chief would do. But he
made no sign. The attendants and the Pingelap
woman dared not even murmur a dissent, for the
deadly glance of the ferocious old man, now
roused to the most intense rage by the wife’s
anger, ranged slowly round the circle. The wife,
still at a pitch of ungovernable fury, said, “ I will
throw this, our son, over too.” “ Eugo ! ” (do it,
then) growled the chief. At once she pushed the
child over the verge. His shriek of mortal terror
had not died on the air when the chief, in a ter-
rible voice, shouted, “Ja kive!” (yourself too).
At the word she leaped into space.
* * * •
A groan was wrung from the servants, and the
Pingelap woman shook like a leaf. The old man
rose deliberately and walked to the edge of the
cliff, and, craning over, looked down to where the
waves broke against the foot of the rock.
He straightened up, remarked calmly, “Re
jokwar” (they are gone), and walked quietly
down the path to the village. Arrived there, he
ordered his canoe to be made ready, and then said
to the Pingelap woman: “You cost too much ;
go on that canoe to your home. If ever I see you
again, you shall follow those who died to-day.”
During his lifetime no native dared mention the
subject in his hearing, but since his death the face
of the rock is called “The cry of the Chief’s
Child.”

Contributed by a picturesque liar :
Edison has perfected a new alarm clock built on the
accelerated accumulative principle. First a small bell is
struck much after the manner of the ordinary spasmodic
alarms now in vogue. The sound is augmented gradu-
ally first by cymbals, then a tambourine and drum, and
later a blast from a trumpet. When the trumpet leaves
off a fuse has burned out, which sends off with a loud
explosion a small brass cannon in the middle of the room.
The explosion is a signal to the sleeper who has set the
alarm that he has just SOsecs. to scamper down the pas-
sage and turn a handle that disconnects a slow-burning
match from 101 b. of dynamite that is laid to blow the
whole house up if he fails. The time of running a'ong the
passage is the moment of real awakening, and
when the dynamite handle is reached the operator is wide
awake. The invention is said to be infallible even with
the most inveterate slumberer.
This excerpt, from Ransome’s “ History of
England” (text book prescribed for N.S.W.
Public School teachers), refers to the situation of
130 years ago, but is still well up-to-date :
Unfortunately, in England the densest ignorance of the
colonies prevailed. Moreover, so angry was the nation at
large ao what appeared to most the insolence of the
Americans, that it was hard for anyone to state the
colonial side of the question without incurring a charge
of want of patriotism, while violent denunciation of the
colonies was everywhere popular. . . . The blame for
losing America must rest upon the whole nation, who
applauded energetic measures and scouted all concilia-
tion In short, prejudice, ignorance and spurious
patriotism were at the bottom of the whole series of
mistakes.

Sharp, piercing pains in the back—Unable to move without
torture—As tired in the morning as at night.
No rest night or day.
Kidney trouble, of course—a bad case.
’Twould have been better if it had been attended to long
before it was.
Didn’t matter, though, in the end—DOAN’S BACKACHE
KIDNEY PILLS fixed it up in a jiffy.
And, by the way, did you ever hear of a case of kidney
trouble that
Ooan’s Backache Kidney pills
wouldn’t cure ?
Head what this Sydney resident says about it. You can
easily verify the statement:
Mrs. W. Gow, 31 John-street, Leichhardt, this city, says : —“For a number
of years my husband has been bad with the kidneys. He had been trying many
remedies to get relief, but the only remedy that succeeded in this way was
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. For two years previous to using these pills he
did little or no work. He is a wood-turner, and this labor is very severe upon
him. The first dose of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills did him so much good that
he said he could have started work next day. I do not suppose that any medi-
cine could absolutely cure him, but Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills relieve him at
all times. When the cold weather comes on he gets, the pains back, and then a
dose or two of these pills send them all away again. They act splendidly upon him,
and enable him to do his work. My son-in-law had pains in the back, brought
on by a fever, and the pills cured him. Some of the neighbors I know swear by
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I might state that it is over 12 months ago when
my husband” first took the pills, and he procured them at Newman’s Pharmacy,
King-street.”

BUT BE SURE THEY ARE DOAN’S
SERIOUS CHANCES
ARE TAKEN IN NEGLECTING A SIM-
PLE CASE OF PILES.
Any person takes serious chances in neglecting
an attack of piles. This ailment has a tendency
to become chronic, and there is also a further ten-
dency of ulceration and forming fistula, which we
know are most difficult to cure.
The safest remedy for any form of Piles,
whether itching or protruding, is Doan’s Oint-
ment. In using it there is no detention from
your daily occupation, and the many cures it has
made have made it famous in every corner of the
world. Any chemist will tell you that it enjoys a
greater demand and more enthusiastic popularity
than any Pile Ointment ever placed on the
market.
Mr. J. J. Gannon, 108 Denison-street Newtown,
this city, states:—“ I have been bad with itch-
ing piles for a good many years. It was only
itching piles at first, but after a time an irrita-
tion of the skin seemed to come from it, and I
had an itchiness to bear in more parts than one.
Uotween the two, my torture was terrible at
times. I had the greatest difficulty to get rid oi
it, having been treated by chemists, doctors, and
trying everything obtainable which was recom-
mended for itching skin troubles. Some time ago
I resolved to try the remedy which cured Mr.
Gulliver. I knew Mr. Gulliver, and knew that
he was not the man to make a false statement,
and if he recommended a thing it must be good,
so I got the remedy which cured him—Doan’s
Ointment. This remedy did me good soon after I
started using it, and by the time I had used two
pots I was quite cured. It is now three months
since I used the Ointment, and I’ve not had any
sign of the piles or the skin trouble since. It is
my opinion that Doan’s Ointment will cure any-
body of itching piles.”
It cannot be repeated too often that Doan’s
Ointment will cure Itching Piles. IT WILL
CURE THEM ABSOLUTELY. But don’t
take our word for it; ask Mr. Gannon. He
knows. It is for sale by all Chemists and Store-
keepers at 2s. 9d. per pot (six pots, 15s. 3d.), or

The Jingo God.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The flush of battle on thy brow—
Thine eye with warlike frenzy mad—
A heavenly sergeant-major thou,
A god in goodly kharki clad.
O, if the Empire need thine aid,
Lord, thou art worth a whole brigade !
To earn an Empire’s lusty thanks,
Re-form, O Lord, our wavering line;
Rally again our shattered ranks,
That we may praise thy name divine,
And ever play, in that great name,
The same old game, the same old game.
Not ours the God who wills that wars
Should cease, and love be king, indeed ;
Whose piteous human heart abhors
Alike our glory and our greed ;
Who holds sweet pity dearer far
Than all a kingdom’s triumphs are.
Not ours the God who takes his stand
On Justice, though an Empire fall,
And metes with cold, impartial hand
An equal measure unto all.
Fond fables both! We Jingoes need
A deity who loves the breed.
Help us to do the thing we would,
Then meekly pray—“ Thy will be done ! ”
And, working still for others’ good,
Annex all lands beneath the sun,
And set, obedient to thy law,
On all the earth our privy paw.
We are thy praying Picaroons,
And in thy name we sweep the Sea
(What time we troll the Christian tunes
And prate of Christian charity),
And, by thy grace, we still shall play
The same old game, the same old way.

Confessions.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Women are so utterly illogical,” said the Major.
Brenda, the Major’s fiancee and sole audience,
felt aggrieved. “Admit some exceptions,” she
pleaded.
“There is one,” he granted. “It is spelt—
Present Compan y.”
The Major’s voice was noted for its caressing
expression. Brenda’s smile increased.
“That Mr. Franklin who travelled out from
home with you is a very nice man,” she said, quite
irrelevantly.
“ Ah ! you have met him ? ”
“Yes, often. He has told me a great deal
about your trip.”
The ice was thin. The Major decided to break
it. “I’m afraid there wasn’t anything very in-
teresting to relate,” he said, cautiously.
“ So few men are honest,” she sighed.
“Quite so,” he agreed. “Mr. Franklin is not
an exceptional man, I presume.”
“I was not thinking of Mr. Franklin ,” Brenda
said scornfully.
He affected surprise.
“I wonder if any man is really honest?” she
queried wistfully.
The Major saw an opening: “Dearest,” he
asked very gently, “ do you doubt me ? ”
She shrugged her shoulders lightly and made a
little moue. He went on.
“ I am going to make a proposition. Supposing,
just for amusement, you know, we confess to each
other all our misdoings during my recent absence.
What say you ?”
“ Delightful,” she cried.
“A woman less reasonable than you mightn’t
like it,” he averred.
Brenda assumed a superior, regal air. “You
begin,” she suggested.
“ Place aux Dames,” he protested, politely.
“Your style will be so much better than mine,”
she urged.
“Not at all. Your narrative will, doubtless,
have the charm of brevity.”
The inference was not wholly flattering to
Brenda’s vanity. Besides, she always resented
being taken for granted. “ Well, after you went
I met a man,” she said, hoping for an interruption,
which did not come.
“A man,” repeated Brenda, watching the Major
from the corner of her eye.
“ Handsome?” queried he, calmly.
“Oh! divinely handsome. Quite the hand-
somest I ever met.”
Was it a gleam of amusement in her hearer’s
dark eye ? Whatever it was, it stimulated her
imagination. “From the very first, we were
mutually attracted. It was a glorious winter, and
he went everywhere I did.”
The Major sat quite still. Brenda jumped up,
and paced the room, as she continued: “He was
very gifted. His poems to me are treasured
still.”
She was really beginning to enjoy herself, but
how could her lover be so unruffled ?
“Treasured in his boxes,” he suggested, prosai-
cally.
“In my heart and brain,” she corrected, with
dramatic expression. “ His roses are in my desk,
his face is engraven upon my memory. Ah ! that
man ! ”
The Major thought how admirable a spirit
was in the woman.
“Did he go away to get married ? ” he inquired,
sy n i path etically.
She wondered if bombs would move him.
“No. He is waiting always, and who knows?
Before we parted, he asked me to let him .”
“Have your photograph, I suppose. What
man wouldn’t?”
The compliment was ignored. She blushed de-
lightfully, and exclaimed, defiantly : “He asked
for a kiss.”
“Shocking !” ejaculated the Major, in a mildly
pained tone. “Of course, he didn’t get it.
though?” 8 4
“ Oh, yes, lie did.”
“Ah ! I understand. Just one chaste, sisterly
salute.”
“No, no,” Brenda protested, crimson-cheeked.
“There were two ; no, more ; several, in fact.”
Her companion stood up. “Is that all?” he
asked, sternly.
He seemed moved at last. She was tired, too.
“Yes,” she admitted, falteringly.
• a Rfsuda ! ” said the Major, in a delivering-
judgment voice, “ I cannot express the pain your
words have given me. Were it not that I, too,
am a sinner, I might be unforgiving. In all
humility, let us confess our faults. As you are
honest, so you will be reasonable, and bear with
my misdoings.”
Curiosity overcame all her other feelings.
You must know, then,” he began, “ that there
was a girl on the boat coming out.”
“ The one Mr. Franklin spoke of?” questioned
Brenda, eagerly.
The same. She was very like you, I thought,
only not so logical. ”
Brenda stood very straight, and bit her lip.
“We flirted
His listener flinched, ever so slightly.
“ And exchanged ”
* * Stamps, ” she suggested, valiantly.
No ; photographs,” he contradicted.
His fiancee sat down. She couldn’t walk about
and be logical together.
( The night before Melbourne I kissed her.”
“How often?” queried the other, faintly.
He was on his guard. “ Only once. I was sin-
ful enough then to enjoy it.”
There was a thrilling silence. It was he who
broke it, and he said :
“ This confession has been a trial to both, I am
sure, but it has taught us mutual forbearance,
hasn’t it?”
“Were you really honest?” asked Brenda,
brokenly.
1 Absolutely, thanks to your showing me the
way.”
Tor some time she seemed to wrestle with her
feelings ; then she burst forth fiercely “Well,
I think you a fickle, faithless man, and I despise
you.”
But what about yourself, dear ? I only got
one, you know, and you owned to several.
Mine was all make-believe,” she confessed,
and added, triumphantly, “ I was true to you all
the time you were away ! ”
' And, now that I am back, you are so untrue
as to hurt me with deliberate inventions. The
cruelty of it! ”
His voice seemed to her full of suffering. He
continued : “ Above all, give me an honest
woman !”
Tears of vexation came to Brenda’s eyes.
“I dm honest. I own up to being dishonest
about my confession,” she asserted.
If only he would unbend a little !
The Major seized his opportunity. “ Brenda! ”
he said, “just as you are I love you more than
any other. Come, let’s be friends again.”
Dignity prohibited her from immediately taking
the hands he held out to her. Feminine bartering
instinct prompted her to dictate terms of sur-
render.
“ On one condition only can things be as they
were,”she informed him.
He would have agreed to anything just then.
“Which?” he queried, with eager eyes and
voice.
“ That you will never call women illogical
again.”
CADETTE.
The Victorian Government has at last shut
Maryborough (Vic.) gaol, which for some time had
a governor and three warders to look after three
prisoners. The Government should now consider
the recent suggestion from the Society for the
Prevention and Cure of Consumption—that one
of the gaols might be closed and fitted up as an
hospital for phthisical incurables.
JEte the turbine ship King Edward and
other vessels of her kind which the cables are
booming, an engineer writes to The Bulletin
from Scotland :
In the first place, the turbine, as at present constructed,
cannot reverse. A spare shaft and propeller are fitted so
as to be brought into action when the vessel is to be sent
astern. The King Edward has two shafts, each equipped
with two propellers, and one shaft fitted with one pro-
peller. This latter is for going astern, and, so far as
checking her headlong speed is concerned, it is not much
good. The vessel makes a long run daily up and down
the Firth of Clyde, and when first put into commission she
was advertised to make several stoppages en route.
But so much time was lost in slowing-down that she
now stops nowhere but at terminal points. She is not the
fastest passenger-boat on the Clyde—the Caledonian and
North British Co’s, possess a number of 22-knot paddle-
boats. They are shallow-draught steamers and their
engmesare fitted with oscillating cylinders—another inno-
vation which is fast coming into more general use in
marine engines. The cables have carefully omitted men-
tioning a narrowly-averted collision between the King
Edward and a rival boat. They were racing, and when
abreast, with only a moderate expanse of water between
them, the turbine boat’s steering-gear went wrong
and she slewed right round and came straight
for the other ship. Both were packed with people,
and the skipper of the paddle-boat knew that the other
vessel could not be stopped inside of a mile. With great
presence of mind, he instantly put his helm hard over, so
that the King Edward merely ranged alongside at
dangerously close quarters. He was handsomely rewarded
by both owners, but not one man in a hundred could have
acted so quickly. This lack of reversing-power should be
overcome before this new machine is fitted to ocean-
flyers. Wherever there is speed there also should be
adequate brake-power.
“Take a stroll through Hyde Park on any
fine afternoon and use your eyes. You will see on
the seats that line the drive from the Marble Arch
to Kensington Gardens scores of the dirtiest
tramps of London. Some of these unfortunate
creatures wear clothes that are nothing but filthy
rags. _ Watch them, and you will see the women
occasionally undoing their hair and re-arranging
it with incidental circumstances that are common
enough in.the by-streets of Naples, but something
startling in a fashionable quarter of London.”—
G. R. Sims. How comforting to know that the
impecunious ladies with unclean heads will pre-
sently have a gorgeous Coronation pageant to
make them happy !
Let us picture Ned, in ermine,
With a crown upon his head,
And forget the filth and vermin
Of the loafers needing bread ;
Let us talk about the dresses
Of the Nobles proud and rich,
And ignore the sore distresses
Of the leaner kind who itch.
Turn your minds away, disdainful,
From those benches in the Park,
For the subjects there are painful
And unworthy of remark.
Never heed the rags and tatters
On those forms of skin and bone
When the cable gaily chatters
Of the monarch on his throne.
When it tells the padded story
Of the Coronation show
We will praise the King of Glory
From whom all such blessings flow,
Whose sun is beaming brightly
On the pageant rich and rare,
Whilst those women impolitely
Pick the vermin from their hair.

T3EECHAM S
PILLS
Are the Best and Safest Family Medicine.
This assertion is made very seriously, and after duly weighing all the reasons
that lead to the conclusion. If Beecham’S PHIS were novel, untried,
and experimental, like so many modern advertised compounds, such a positive
statement could not be put forward. But everyone knows for a. fact that
Beecham’s Pills
have stood the searching test of over fifty years
-» • . I *1 i JI J-T
continuously advancing popularity, until to-day the demand tor this speci c
in all parts of the world is greater than ever. With a certainty, the universal
verdict of common sense everywhere justifies the claim. And then, again,
Beecham’s Pills
do not require the publication of testimonials to
maintain their tremendous demand.
Why ?
Because those who once try BEECH AM’S
PILLS are naturally impelled to inform
others of the benefits to be derived
therefrom. This is perhaps a slow, but
it is certainly an honest and a powerful process, and in this
way the confidence and esteem of the public have been
secured.
No other Medicine in the World can claim
so many regular users.
Thousands of families always keep a box of Beech&m’S Pills in the
house, so that on the first sign of any irregularity of the system a timely dose
may be administered and further trouble and suffering averted. Nine-tenths
of the Beecham’s Palls sold are purchased by those who have used them
before and have found them indispensable as
A FAMILY MEDICINE.
