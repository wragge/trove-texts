this I append a few questions ;—Do you experience

Why Suffer hidden anguish while the following guaran-

Many persons have wasted large amounts in vain en-

eminently satisfactory results. As a proof of my con-
fidence in the power of my remedy for the cure of
NERVOUS COMPLAINTS,
I am prepared to refund the fee of my patients,

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. GUMMING,
of TarraTille, Victoria, Australia, says I
« About a year ago, I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in Hfe.
Obtaining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to
me, I finally tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and.
ir
from that time, I began to gain health and
strength. I continued the treatment until
fully recovered, and now have very great
pleasure in telling my friends of the merits
of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and the happy re-
sults of its use. I consider it the best blood-
purifier known.” * j

The Caligraph Writing Machine .
THE CALIGRAPH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that th<* platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every-
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

A.B. paid the Unlimited Agency £5 for pro-

A Rhyme of Elections.
Who will get your vote, my brothers ?
You, the equal-franchised men
Who have wrested untried power
From the pig-vote upper ten?
You, who felt the class-oppression,
And were helpless to protest;
You, whose wrongs in legislation
Still stand fully manifest.
You, ground down by laws unequal,
Made less just by Mammon’s aid.
Ah ! how surely and how often
Was your righteous cause betrayed !
Now your hands are free, my brothers,
Will you fetter them once more
By a choice of men who sold you
While your party-badge they wore ?
When each braggart stands before you
Bawling from a brazen throat,
Will you listen when he offers
For your bane his antidote ?
Question well the ruling motives
Of the man who seeks support ;
Give no credence to mere statements,
Bring his record into court.
Think the while he asks your suffrage.
Leopards cannot change their skin ;
Figs can never grow on thistles,
Sudden converts soonest sin.
If his past will bear inspection—
If he has a stainless name —
Even then I charge you, brothers,
Play a silent, waiting game.
Find out if his creed be narrow,
Shun the pious egotist,
If he face the test of ballot
Score his name out on your list.
Let the grim sectarian struggle
At the bottom of the poll;
Bid him preach in other places
If he wants to save your soul.
If a candidate comes smiling
To betray you with a kiss,
Though he hold the bag, my brothers,
Let your greeting be a hiss.
Vote for men who are in earnest,
Legislation is not play ;
Though the average member treats it
In a very jaunty way.
Vote for men who have the wisdom,
Better known as common sense;
Learn the art of recognising
And condemning all pretence.
Vote for men whose aims are honest,
And who vote their ticket straight;
Then on surest of foundations
You will help to build the State.
M.
William Dean Howells, American novelist:,
has written a “ socialist ” novel called “ A
Traveller from Altrur-ia,” which is likely to have
as large a circnlation as “ Looking Backward.”
Kingston relates how disgusted he was,
travelling in Palestine, with a millionaire, who
couldn’t climb up the rocks. He had wasted his
energies making money, and now thought to begin
enjoying himself. Like the mere man of business
entering politics.
In London the other day : “Where do you
come from ? ” “ Australia,” said I. He was, as I
said before, an American and evidently had no
time to worry about geography. “ Australia,” said
he, “ I guess that’s the county where the Sydney
Bulletin’s printed, aint it ? ”
Oscar Wilde has published an alleged
poem of 180 lines, or thereabouts, in an elegantly
bound volume of fifty pages. The poem is printed
in capital letters, and some of the pages contain
two lines only. There are also blank pages and
“decorative” pages thrown in to preserve the
poem from any suspicion of heaviness. It is like-
wise a very bad poem, and the price is two guineas.
All the rage in Paris. Latest Parisian
preventative posted in sealed letter, 1/2 stamps.
National Drug Co., Russell-st., Melbourne.
A Bundaberg Kanaka, Tarriwaggeo, of
Aoba, recently fell sick, and was off work for
several months. On his recovery, Tarriwaggeo
refused to take wages for the sick period or to
allow it to be paid to his credit in the bank.
“How comes it,” wails a Bananaland organ,
“that such a fine sense of honour should exist in
the mind of a savage and be absent from that of a
white worker?” Poor Tarriwaggeo! Had he
taken the whole of his three years’ wages and only
worked 12 months he might have rested peacefully
on the assurance that he wasn’t overpaid to the
tune of sixpence.
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by
Sharp’s new “Cannalin” treatment, large quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers
throughout the colonies. It is obtainable, with
advice, from 257 George-street, Sydney.
A badly-defeated candidate at last N.S.W.
general • election writes to The Bulletin as
follows :
1 contested the electorate as a Protectionist Labour
candidate, and only secured 3 (three) votes, however this
is a beginning. The people here are very conservative,
and anyone who takes a stand favouring republicanism
does not take. I am one of those who certainly do not
believe in keeping a Royal family in affluence and luxury
at the expense of the poor people of this colony. I wrote
to Governer Duff for his Viceregal patronage to my can-
didature whiohe he declined to give.
Concerning which The Bulletin can only say
that, as a Republican candidate who applied for
“ vice-regal patronage,” the above candidate got
three votes too many. Three dead cats would
have expressed the situation a lot better.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities —a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.
POST FREE TO ANY PART OF AUSTRALIA.
No matter how far in the interior you reside, ELLIS’S
system has already proved a sovereign balm to thousands
of country residents who, whilst performing their daily
avocations, had previously to endure the excruciating
tortures of narrow-fitting and shapeless foot gear, the
insoles of which fairly bristle with tacks and other un-
comfortable impedimenta. All boots made on specially-
constructed lasts, giving the foot an ample tread,
and consequently comfort. You can WEAR ELLIS’S
BOOTS STRAIGHT AWAY—they are a “going con-
cern ” from the start. The materials are well tanned, and
will not “draw’* or blister the feet, as most new boots
do. Send for catalogue, post free. The following

Federation in Our Time.
In this issue of The Bulletin ex-Minister
Drake, of Queensland, contributes his own
particular scheme of Federation as another
addition to the fast-accumulating mass of
federal literature. Mr. Drake’s plan is, in
it essential aspect, very little different from
a vast number of other plans already before
the public. His central idea is that the
Federal Government should be established,
from the very beginning, on a thoroughly
democratic basis, and in this respect
he stands on exactly the same ground
as ninety per cent, of true Federationists
throughout this continent. The Federal
Parliament is to consist of one Chamber
elected on an absolute manhood suffrage basis
in the proportion of one member to every
30,000 electors, but certain provisions are
introduced to prevent the four more thinly-
peopled provinces being overshadowed and
entirely swamped by the vote of Victoria and
N.S. Wales. There is to be no nominee
council, no brick-and-mortar suffrage, and no
special representation of the blatant “virtue”
of Thrift in any shape. In order to avoid
the stumbling-block of provincial jealousies,
a Federal State is to be created in Central
Australia, and a Federal capital—an ideal
city of white stone and marble—erected
there as the political centre of the Common-
wealth. All this—including the white city
of palaces in the far interior, and many other
matters which will be found in Mr. Drake’s
letter —are, however, merely pictures of the
State which, as almost everybody is agreed,
ought to be, and as nine-tenths of those
Australians who thin-k on the subject at all
will fully appreciate its desirability, it may
be accepted, to a great extent, without fur-
ther argument. The proposed Common-
wealth, based entirely on manhood suffrage,
with no Party Government system to hamper
its wise deliberations, no class distinctions,
and no nominee legislators to reverse the
popular decisions, with, as its political
centre, an ideal city in an ideal State where
the curse of landlordism is to be absolutely
non-existent, is a vision of a small earthly
Paradise. And, in this case, as in that of the
heavenly Paradise, almost everybody is
agreed, in a certain dull, indifferent, lack-
lustre fashion, about the desirability of
getting there ; consequently it may be
accepted, without further argument, that it
is the duty of this country to arrive at the
earliest possible moment, and in the most
effectual manner which can be devised.
# * *
But concerning the means by which the
ideal Commonwealth is to be attained pro-
bably 99 per cent, of the population has no
idea whatever, and of the remainder hardly
any two persons have the same idea. Mr.
DRAKEdeclares emphatically that no machine-
made Constitution will ever answer the pur-
pose. The future Australian legislative
system, in his opinion, must grow by a
steady process of development ; it must
evolve itself by degrees, instead of being
turned out complete and ready-made. There-
fore, he suggests that the existing—or par-
tially-existing —Federal Council should be
transformed into a representative body
elected by manhood suffrage, and should
thereafter expand, by a natural process, into
the Parliament of all the Australian The
suggestion has a sonorous ring about it, but
The Bulletin, at all events, seriously
doubts if it has anything more than its
sound to ’"‘commend it.
• • •
It is an unfortunate circumstance that the
Constitution which is evolved by a natural
process of development has the same illimit-
able capacity for growing crooked as all
other products. The machine-made article,
o.i the other hand, has an equally compre-
hensive tendency to be made crooked. In
this respect there is but little to choose
between them. Mr. Drake’s central axiom,
that the Federal constitution should be built
up by the people, instead of being made
for (lie people by a handful of practically
self - appointed delegates, and that it
should thus represent the sentiment
of the nation rather than that of
a few obscure politicians, is excellent in
theory. But The Bulletin grows more and
more doubtful if the nation at large has any
real or definite sentiment on the subject.
The great bulk of Australians care too little
about the matter to take any active part in the
work of building up a United Australia.
Almost every one believes in Federation in
just the same sense as lie believes in a future
state of eternal bliss ; he has a theoretical
conviction that he should take some steps to
get there, but the conviction is merely
theoretical, and leads to nothing. Mr.
Drake proposes that the first breath of
genuine life should be breathed into the
feeble and moribund Federal Council by
New South Wales sending thither five mem-
bers chosen by universal suffrage, his idea
being that the other provinces must speedily
follow suit, and thus the Council would
become, by one stroke, the most Demo-
cratic representative body in Austra-
lasia. But New South Wales could
do nothing of the kind without the
sanction of both Houses of the Legislature.
Therefore the difficulties in the way of this
first small instalment of Democratic Federa-
tion are just the same as those that stand in
the way of Democratic Federation in general.
It is even questionable if the New South
Wales Legislature would join the present
Federal Council on any conditions, Demo-
cratic or otherwise. It is also, an absolute
certainty that the people of New . So ith
Wales care not one straw for the Federal
Council, and three-fourths of them have
almost forgotten its existence. And even if
New South Wales sent its elective members
to the Council there is no evidence whatever
that the elective principle would spread to
the other provinces.
✓ * . # *
If Australia is going to feder&te at all it is
almost certain that it must start with a
machine-made Constitution put togel her, not
by the people, but by the politicians. It will
doubtless be an exceedingly bad Constitution,
but when it gets into working order the
nation will take an interest in it as a matter
of necessity, and will proceed to put it to
rights. Whether this will be a natural or
an unnatural way of arriving at the result
is a mere question of words ; there is no
natural and no especially unnatural way of
building up forms of government. A Federal
Constitution is not a vegetable to be grown
from the seed, nor an animal which has a
fixed date of maturity. Also, there is no
finality about it ; whether it is made by the
spontaneous action of the people —if such a
thing were possible —or by Parkes’ famous
Convention, the nation will go on patching,
mending and altering it till it finally arrives
at perfection or chaos Provided it gets a
beginning—no matter what kind of a begin-
ning—the natural process of development
will do the rest; it will expand into as good
a Constitution as the nation deserves, and
what the nation deserves can only be ascer-
tained when we discover what kind of a
Constitution it is.
# * •
The Bulletin’s ideas have undergone a
great change since the days of the abortive
Convention. Since then it has gradually
begun to realise the height and depth and
vastness of the popular indifference upon
the Federal question. The fact has slowly
dawned upon it that nine-tenths of the popu-
lation takes no real interest in the future
Australian nation, in the alleged glorious
destiny of this continent, in the marble
metropolis which is to be the political centre
of the Commonwealth, or in any of the
other abstract glories of United Australia.
And, despite the general adhesion which is
given—mostly as a matter of form—to the
principle of Federation, there is reason to
believe that nine-tenths of, Australian poli-
ticians are equally indifferent. Rrobably the
embarrassed financial state of the country
will, ere long, prove the strongest influence
in the direction of unity. Australia and
Tasmania have a public debt of £165,000,000,
and pay in interest : about £6,500,000
annually. Their liabilities are falling due
with alarming rapidity ; every year now,
until 1914, there is a huge sum to be repaid,
and to do this new loans have to be floated,
and every new loan is floated at heavy
expense and adds something more to the
mass of liabilities. The credit of the separate
provinces is not good enough to make any
cheap and comprehensive process of conver-
sion possible. But it is quite within the
bounds of possibility that a strong Federal
Government could convert each loan, as it
falls due, into interminable 3 per cent, stock,
and by so doing it would reduce the annual
tribute which has to be paid to England by
something like £1,650,000 per annum. And,
in addition to this, it might probably, by abol-
ishing five out of the six Governors and five
out of six vice-regal establishments, by doing
away with border Customs officials, pro-
vincial naval and military establishments, and
by consolidating the railway, postal, customs,
excise, judicial and other departments, in-
crease the saving to £2,500,000 per annum—
an amount equal to one-tenth of the entire
revenue. This is an argument which appeals
far more strongly to the community at large
than all the eloquence concerning Australia’s
future destiny that has been expended since
the Federal movement first began.
* * *
The Bulletin, at all events, is now willing
to accept Federation on the plan of the Con-
vention, or on an even worse basis, and trust
to the people for the rest. Before the Com-
monwealth can be started on an ideally Demo-
cratic plan it is necessary to wait until the most
backward of the provincial Legislatures has
been captured by a Democratic majority,
and that is an event whose period no prophet
can foresee. It may be 20 years before
West Australia can establish a Legislature as
progressive as those at Adelaide and Sydney,
and by that time half the western pro-
vince may be jobbed away to British
syndicates and covered with land-giant
railways, and all the Northern Territory
may be a Chinese province, and half North
Queensland may be a piebald land of Kanakas
and assorted Asiatics. But if Australia
federates now, on the best available basis,
then it rests with the majority of the nation
to shut down on black labour, and land-grant
railway syndicates, and foreign land-
grabbers, and similar abominations. The
question to be settled is—whether is it
better to wait until the six Legislatives of
Australia have been sufficiently reformed to
agree upon the formation of a thoroughly
Democratic Federal Parliament, or to take
the best Federal Parliament which can be
obtained and proceed to reform it after-
wards ? In other words, is it easier and
more practicable to reform one Parliament
or six? Considering that all the problems
which are most urgently in want of settle-
ment would lie within the domain of the
Federal Legislature, this is really the
question at issue. And The Bulletin, for
one, votes for accepting the best kind of
Federation which can be obtained at once,
and trusting to the Australian people for the
consequences. *
Some Solid Reflections.
In Australia, Jack is as good as his master.
Our laws are not perfect ; but to energy and
perseverance they open the avenues of pros-
perity as widely as these are opened any-
where. There is no definite barrier between
rich and poor ; class melts insensibly into
class ; every day men are passing from
poverty to affluence, and from affluence to
poverty. As natural wealth is exploited,
opportunity lessens, and the task of industry
becomes severer ; yet its reward, if more
moderate and less rapid than formerly, is no
less certain. Butin Australia, J aok is not
as good as his master ; or he would be master,
and not Jack. If Jack remains a labourer
all his life, it is because, in the vast majority
of cases, he has not sufficient brains and self-
control to become anything better. Generally
speaking, if a man is a failure, the reason
lies in the man himself. Generally speaking,
if a man is a success, the reason lies in the
man himself. Misfortune is rarely unaccom-
panied by fault; good fortune rarely comes,
and remains, without desert. Law rules ;
effect invariably follows cause ; and for good
or ill our own acts govern us.
* * #
An impression is currentjin certain circles
that some special virtue exists in Labour
with a capital L. The sooner the labourer
gets rid of that impression the better. Hob-
nailed boots confer no peculiar sanctity, are
no proof of particular intelligence. In fact,
if they are worn for any length of time, they
generally prove the absence of intelligence ;
since the first thing intelligence does for a
man is to take the nails out of his boots.
Then he becomes a capitalist. Capitalists are,
by the law of their existence, the brainiest
men in the community ; since when they
lose their brains they lose their capital, and
cease to be capitalists. That is why it is
always so difficult for labourers, as a class,
to escape the oppression of capitalists, as a
class. In the first place, they are down,
and, in the second place, they have a natural
tendency to stay down ; because any indi-
vidual labourer with brains enough to get
up becomes a capitalist, and too often helps
to trample on the class from which he has
sprung. Hence, Labour is constitutionally
the weaker side ; and, in any conflict with
capital, it is pretty safe to assume that justice
is with the weaker side. /
• * *
As a supporter of democracy, the theory
of Government which tries to combine equal
justice with equal the Bulletin
naturally sympathises with the weaker side.
But that does not prevent it from seeing
that in H, H. Champion's definition of the
Labour-party in Australia as lions led by
asses, and in Miss Shaw’s definition of the
Queensland Labour-party as consisting of
inept chatterers at the head and larrikins at
the tail, with the great body of sensible men
silent in the middle, there is a large measure
of truth. As already suggested, incapacity is
the natural condition of manual labour ; since
the moment that a capable man is produced
his capacity lifts him above the necessity of
manual labour. Yet until the Labour-party
can secure the brains which are necessary for
its guidance, it must necessarily fail to pro-
gress. Brute force alone cannot make head
against vested interests capably led. The
conclusion is obviously that labour will not
succeed single-handed ; that any attempt to
secure special class privileges is foredoomed
to failure ; and that the labourer must be
content to merge his class interests in the
general interests of democracy, and to move
with the general army of reform.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
Contemplate the condition of the Queens-
land Labour-party. It is engaged in a
struggle with a peculiarly vicious and corrupt
ring of public plunderers, and it is really
doing its very best to support and continue
the domination of that ring. The party is
comparatively small in numbers, consisting
only of the unions and their direct adherents;
and it is vitally important to its success
that the mass of small property-owners
should be well-disposed towards it. There-
fore, in 1891, it arranged a strike in the
course of which various insensate out-
rages were committed ; with the result
that the community as a whole was fright-
ened out of its wits, and the plural-
voting ring returned to power in 1893 with
a Parliamentary majority which makes op-
position hopeless, while the funds of the
unions were wasted and their strength was
destroyed. The failure of the strike was abso-
lute, therefore the party leaders are now carry-*
ing on a fresh strike, attended with more
outrages, in order effectually to ruin the
propects of success at the Parliamentary
election of 1896. The justice of the strike
is not now in question. Its expediency is.
But the Labour leaders will carry it out to
the bitter end, while every day of its
existence helps to increase the shock of
inevitable failure, and to lessen the power
of the party.
# • #
Consider the position of the New South
Wales Labour-party. Singularly successful
at the polls three years ago, it elected to
Parliament a number of representatives of
whom most, if they displayed no magnificent
talents, conducted themselves with good
sense and moderation. Under the influence
of parliamentary life some of these represen-
tatives gradually took a broader and more
'elevated view of political matters, and thus
became obnoxious to the generally illiberal
wire-pullers of the electoral caucuses. The
consequence was the pledge schism, which
at last month’s elections undoubtedly lost
many seats to Labour. Now Mr. Joseph
Cook, the leader of the party in the last
Parliament, has accepted office in Mr. Reid’s
Ministry. There is no reason to believe
that he has sacrificed one whit of his prin-
ciples, since the Ministerial programme is,
on the whole, the most progressive yet put
forward in the province ; and a Labour
representative is plainly in a position to help
the cause far more as Minister than as mere
member. Yet Mr. Cook’s re-election on
taking office was opposed by a section of the
party apparently out of pure spite and
jealousy, since his action is thoroughly
approved by his constituents, arid his defeat
would retard the very reforms for which his
opponents profess to be struggling. How,
in such circumstances, is the triumph of
Labour possible ?
* * #
Two courses solicit the Australian Demo-
cracy ; two examples confront it. The one
is that of America : the other that of Maori-
land. In America we see how the machine-
made politics of two great parties have con-
verted the goddess of liberty into a strumpet
who sells her favours to the highest bidder.
The “spoils system” holds undisputed
sway; and pure ideals of citizenship are
dragged at the heels of'the boodler through
the mire of the caucus. Whatever “ Demo-
crat” and “Republican” meant once, they
are now but the labels of organised factions


contending ruthlessly for sectional pre-
dominance, with its concomitants of pay,
place and power. Honest men, who love
their country, stand aghast, apathetic, hope-
less, while the mob sways to and fro, gulled
by artifice or fettered by corruption. With
dismal birth-throes of strike, and riot, and
outrage, the Populist party struggles hardly
into existence, vaguely desiring to reform
the national life, but finding that it must
first renew individual honour and honesty.
America lies throttled by her own hand.
« # *
In Maoriland, on the other hand, we see a
(country industrially at peace, prosperous,
(progressive. The wisdom of its system of
government is shown by every test which
can be applied—by improvement of credit,
by increase of trade, by addition to wealth,
by extension of settlement and industry.
Yet the distinctive features of that system
are the direct and proportional taxation of
■wealth ; the endeavour to free labour from
(servitude by lessening its burdens and widen-
ing its opportunities for advancement; the
•decision that the object of politics is not the
(triumph of party, but the welfare of the
people. In character and tendency, the
present Maoriland Administration is the
most democratic in Australasia ; and it is idle
to deny that the gloomy prognostications
which greeted its entry to power have been
conclusively falsified. The best proof of its
value is the confidence of the people, shown
time and again, and the fact that the
journals representative of Australian pluto-
cracy, with persistent malevolence, do their
best to hide its light under a bushel, and to
discount the value of the lesson which
Maoriland teaches.
• • •
It cannot be said that her protective tariff
is the cause of America’s social and industrial
distress. There are many causes, and it is
well-nigh impossible to definitely identify
any one of them, since the argument is inter-
minable that whai is apparently a cause may
be only an accompaniment or an effect of
conditions created by other causes. It can-
not be said that direct taxation is the source
of Maoriland’s prosperity, since the revenue
so raised is not more than a seventh of the
total revenue from taxation. But a very
strong argument can be adduced to show
that the monopoly of wealth and the sources
of wealth is at the root of the misery in
one ci mu try, and that -the comparative
absence of such monopoly is at the root of
the welfare of the other. And it is a sound
inference that the eternal strife between
Freetrade and Protection has not discouraged
the unequal distribution of wealth in
America ; while direct taxation has certainly
discouraged it in Maoriland.
# * #
Short of prohibition, Protection has no
logical standing. Neither has Freetrade, as
long as a revenue tariff continues. While
the country imports a shred of anything
which the country can produce, to that
extent Protection does not protect. While a
single duty is levied on anything imported,
to that extent trade is not free. It follows
that if either policy is pushed to its furthest
extent—to the extent which is needed to
make it a perfect and logical policy, the
direct taxation of wealth remains the only
form of taxation possible. Neither Free-
trade nor Protection has anything to
do with taxation, though they are often
confused with it. They are both theories
as to the method of conducting foreign
exchanges, and the theory of taxation
deals with the method of raising internal
revenue. The less taxation the better is a
theoretical maxim of good government, since
all taxation tends to diminish industry and
restrict enterprise, and can only be justified
on the ground that it is necessary for the
exercise of the functions of government, or
that in certain cases it may be used to help
industry and enterprise more than it injures
them. The more direct the taxation the better
is another such maxim, since direct taxa-
tion suits the burden to the back and makes
the rich man pay in proportion to his wealth
and the poor man in proportion to his
poverty. Thus it continually strikes at the
monopoly of natural opportunities which is
a chief source of human wretchedness.
# • *
Figures can be manoeuvred to prove any-
thing ; but those who bring figures to show
that direct taxation will reduce land values
have to show how it is that in three years,
from 1888 to 1891, under a property-tax and
a land and income tax, total land values in
Maoriland rose £11,000,000 ; while settle-
ment and improvements showed a cor-
responding increase. Those who complain
that the man who has. put his capi-
tal into land should riot be taxed
more than the man who has put his
capital into sheep, or shoes, or stocks, must
be reminded that the land has a permanent
value to which a progressive community adds
from year to year independently of any merit
or effort of the owner ; while in other things,
which have only a transitory value, the
owner depends on his own luck or shrewd-
ness for his profit. In any case, if land
monopoly can be shown to be evil for the
community, the welfare of the community
must take precedence over the rights of the
individual/ And the Bulletin hopes to see
the day when all taxation will be levied
directly on wealth—whatever the tax chosen.
Then Protection and Freetrade may fight on
a fair field, either by clapping on 10,000 per
cent, import duties, or by abolishing Customs
altogether.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Victoria’s New Saviour.
From last week’s chaos of Victorian politics
The Bulletin extracts the supposition that a
motion of want of confidence in the Patterson
Government, tabled by Mr. George Turner, is
now being debated ; that the said motion will
probably be carried by a very large majority if
it isn’t lost by a very small one, and that
George Turner is therefore likely to reign in
Patterson’s stead. The work of ousting the
hot, distempered butcher was to be resumed on
Tuesday night, by which time that calamitous
preacher of “confidence” had possibly got a
promise of renewal for an uncertain term, or
had else made up his mind definitely to expire
with as many groans as possible. The situation
is full of personal excitement for members of the
’Ouse ; to the people outside that costly build-
ing it gives no new sense of joy, sorrow, hope,
or despair. As long as the Victorian Assembly
gives shelter to its present occupants, and its
mace is borne before Tom Bent, the public will
spare themselves disappointment by expecting
nothing good to emerge from the hurly-burly.
And if Patterson should perchance effect a
dissolution of Parliament, and the 95 com-
ponent parts of that discredited assemblage
apply for reinstatement, they will be mostly
reinstated with the result that the country will
go on sneering feebly, as before. Victoria is
not nearly ready for the inevitable outbreak of
popular feeling. George Turner was a factor
in the mis-Government of Shiels—-Skirls, the
predecessor of Patterson, the devoted ad-
herent of Munro, and the man who played such
havoc among his splendid opportunities that
even now, in the hour of Patterson’s miserable
collapse, he is declared to be “impossible ” by
the Opposition that cheers his verbosity.
Turner’s upheaval may mean the old Shiels
Ministry with the old “impossible” head turned
into a bit of the tail. At all events, a Cabinet
fashioned by Turner must include most of the
unsatisfactory material that Shiels used, and
when completed it may prove to be a weaker
article. In the meantime, Victoria can form a
fair estimate of Turner’s wisdom, and fore-
sight, and strength of purpose from that gentle-
man’s remarkable declarations —“ I think when
we have removed the Patterson Government
from the Treasury benches confidence will be
immediately restored. Money will roll into the
Treasury. There will be no deficit, for the people
will have no doubt about getting good legislation,
and, therefore, there will be little trouble in
making the finances straight. ” Patterson at his
bushiest bush banquet never talked nonsense
more puerile than this. Turner, it may be
observed, wastes no time upon a sketch of his
financial policy. He doesn’t need a policy.
He will just sit on the Treasury bench and
gaze upon the restoration of confidence with
a gentle, lawyerlike smile. When the people
feel confident of getting “ good legislation,”
the finances will straighten themselves with-
out assistance from Turner. The all im-
portant thing is to have Turner there.
But why joke on this painful subject? This is
rather a time for wondering whether Victoria
will ever attribute the degradation of her Par-
liament to the fearful and wonderful increase
in the number of its lawyers. Will the people
ever sit down and ask themselves how much
wise and honest or windy and corrupt legisla-
tion has emanated from Shiels, O’Logixlen,
Davies, Deakin, Wrixon, and the rest of
them. Is Frank Madden a promising circum-
stance, and is Turner a consummation to be
devoutly wished ? A strong negative point in
favour of Patterson is the fact that he was
never a lawyer, nor anything like one, and now
when his bogus reputation for intellect is as
dead as the dodo, and the poor infuriated
creature really needs a kind word, The Bulle-
tin has much pleasure in statiflg that Patter-
son has ever been a butcher to the bone.

The Old leaven.
The Bulletin asks Minister Gould to revoke
at once the decision of the Minister for Justice
in last N.S.W. Parliament, re-introducing
the gag in prisons. No considerations of red-
tape or departmental etiquette should be
permitted for a moment to stand in the way.
The revival of the gag is a frank reversion to
barbarism. It is an admission that gaolers are
unable to control criminals except under the
old system of punishment by torture ; that is
to say, in the light of modern penology, it is a
confession of official incapacity. The director
of prisons—a lucky individual who, without a
single dav’s penal experience, was lately pitch-
forked into his present high and responsible
position tells us, in effect, that he cannot
manage the brutes under his charge unless
he be permitted to descend to their level,
and commit brutality in the name of the law.
The gag is a physical torture differing in degree,
not in kind, from the rack or the thumbscrew.
It is the chosen revenge of the ignorant or
vicious warder who irritates criminals to mad-
ness that he may punish them for being mad.
Every argument that supports the gag sup-
ports the red-hot pincers, the boot, and any
other form of cruelty which the devil in
man delights to use when buttressed in
office and sanctified by authority. The
horrid face with staring eyes, jaws forcibly
wrenched asunder, and blood trickling from
the corners of the injured mouth, gives keen
pleasure to the official torturer who has been
offended by some impertinence or carelessness
on the part of a prisoner; and the dignity of
the law is invoked to minister to his appetite
for revenge. It is of no avail to point to regu-
lations framed to prevent the abuse of the gag.
No regulations were ever drawn through which
low cunning and callous brutality will not
break their way. Any punishment permitted
by law will be eagerly welcomed by the
baser tools of the law. And it is non-
sense to say that no other means of repres-
sion are available. The fact that to the
official mind a prisoner seems to need the gag
is of itself evidence, either that he is diseased
and should be under medical care, or that the
prison system is inhuman or ineffective. it
is said that the gag is only to be used in
extreme cases. But the worst criminals rarely
go to extremes without a cause. They have
sense enough not to kick against the pricks;
and it is only when insane or goaded to
rebellion by petty persecution that they
lose all self - control and shriek the foul
language which the gag is designed to silence.
If there be occasionally a case in which
neither disease nor cruelty, but “ pure cussed-
ness ” is the trouble, then isolation and low
diet are the proper remedies. But to bring the
gag in the name of the people of New South
Wales, as an aid to tyranny and an excuse for
incompetence, is to degrade the law and the
people below the level of the criminal whom it
is sought to punish. The criminal, at worst, is
rarely more than an offender against the law.
But the gag, sanctioned by the people, is a
crime against humanity.

He State Life Assurance.
Dear Bulletin, —There is an ounce or two of
wisdom in your recent article with quite
half a pound of nonsense. The superstructure
you have so elaborately raised, unfortunately
for the value of the criticism, has an unsound
foundation. You say that the yearly premium
at age 30 to cover ,£lOO at death is .£1 17s. 7d.
True, if the policy applied for is a non-profit
one. But you must deal with »things as they
are. The ratio of non-profit assurances to the
whole sum at risk ranges from the one-two-
hundredth to the one-six-hundredth, an infini-
tesimal proportion. The average office pre-
mium for <£loo at 30 varies from <£2
4s. 9d. to £2 Bs. 2d., thus providing a
loading of from 34 to 44 per cent, over the
net premium, correctly quoted by you
£1 13s. 4d. There is a wide margin between
these figures and “ something less than 12 per
cent.,” on which you based your argument.
When dealing with the interest phase of the
question you propound one or two original
theories, prominent amongst which is that
wherein you say that companies “assume that
the interest earned during the first half of the
period of assurance will be more than 4 per
cent, and less than that during the remainder
of the term.” This will be news to most
actuaries. You are right about the wisdom of
State legislation. The American system is
faulty in many respects, and will stand a lot of
improvement, but anything is better than the
apathy displayed by N.S. Wales in its life
assurance legislation. In this respect all the
other provinces are ahead. And you are
on equally solid ground in your reference to
the cut-throat competition existing amongst
the offices. In most other businesses some
restriction is placed on the number, and
some discretion is used in the personnel,
of representatives; in life - assurance—with
one or two notable exceptions—none. It
is no uncommon thing to meet some half-
dozen or more “bagmen”—without the bag —•
of one particular company in some suburban
street any fine day, or, for the matter of that,
any wet day, arm out at elbow and boot inno-
cent of sole. These men revel on the princely
pay of one shilling per month and —what they
can pick up. We are somewhat mixed in the
life assurance world to-day.— Geo. Crowley.
[Mr. Crowley is the manager of the City Mutual Life
Ass. Socy. (Sydney), Limited. The Bulletin feats that
Mr. Crowley’s knowledge of the matter he is dealing
with is also a trifle limited, and would recommend a re-
perusal of the article he so jauntily criticises. When
writing our article we were greatly tempted to refer to
individual companies to illustrate our remarks, hut for-
bore for reasons that Mr. Crowley will doubtless appre-
ciate when we are done with him. We accept Mr.
Crowley's letter as an invitation to examine the business
of the company with which be is associated, and we see
no reason why his invitation should not be accepted.
During the vear 1891 the City Mutual received 1122,786 as
renewal premiums, and £4583 as premiums on new busi-
ness. The company paid in the same year 1750 commis-
sion on renewals, £lll3 commission on new business, and
in addition £5351 “ other management expenses.” How
to divide this last sum is puzzling, but if it be split up
between the old and the new business in proportion to
premium-income—but counting one pound of new busi-
ness as costing, in office expenses, twice what the same
amount of old business would cost—then the 15351 “other
management expenses” would be charged £3BOO to old
business and £1551 to new. On this assumption the City
Mutual old business would have cost £750 commission
and £3BOO office expenses, etc., or in all £4550, the total
premium income being £22,786 i.e., out of every £lOO
paid as premiums £2O went in expenses, leaving out of
consideration the original cost of securing the business.
To a man of 30 year’s of age, Mr. Crowley's co. would
insure £lOO, payable at death, for £2 4s. 9d., with parti-
cipation in profits, and for £ll6s. Bd. without profits
the actual risk to the co. being £ll3s. 4d. Supposing,
therefore, a man took out a policy on the profit principle,
for which the annual premium was £lOO, out of such
premium it would be allowable to spend £8 to manage
the business While £lB would be available to be returned
to the insurer in the shape of bonuses, the balance, £74,
being the cover required to meet the risk of death. Just
now we showed, from the co.’s owff returns, that the cost
of business is £2O per cent., instead of £8 assumed in the
tables, and the margin of profit, therefore, is reduced
from £lB to £6. It is plain that two-thirds of the extra
premiums insurers pay for bonus purposes are swallowed
up in working the business. In this respect the City
Mutual is by no means singular, and in these concluding
remarks it may therefore be lost sight of. Persons are
induced to pay a certain amount over the ordinary pre-
miums on a virtual promise of a return of this excess with
interest added—this return is called a bonus. Arguing
from the official records before us we have no hesitation
in saying that with a few notable exceptions this under-
taking is pure deceit, as the companies know very well
they are unable to fulfil their promises, and that the only
course open to them in order to keep out of the Insolvent
Court is to appropriate the bulk of the reserve or loading
for profit to working their business.— Ed. B.]
The Economy Craze.
The S.M. Herald has already arisen to
point out to Premier Reid that his first
duty is to make the New South Wales finances
balance by economy rather than by new taxa-
tion. New taxation must fall mostly on the
rich, while further economy would descend in a
large proportion on the poor; therefore the
Herald’s attitude is sufficiently intelligible.
The cost of government in New South Wales,
it says, is extravagant and “ monstrously out
of proportion to the wants of a million
and a-quarter of people.” This good old
wheeze has been dragged out so often
as a proof that a land, or income, or
property-tax is altogether unnecessary, that
it is time something were done to it. The short
and beautifully simple argument on which it is
based is that the average cost to the central
Treasury of governing New South Wales is
somewhere about £7 15s. per head, while in
dear old Hingland the whole business is done
for £2 7s. 9d. Therefore, New South Wales
has no business to want more revenue until her
expenditure is brought down to the British
level. But, in reality, N.S.W. has got economy
down, in many directions, almost as far as it
can safely go—in some branches of the public
service, such as the police force, it has already
gone far further than it ought to go ; and
the province, all things considered, is governed
more cheaply, despite the apparent discrepancy,
than Great Britain. Three-and-a-half millions
of the Cornstalk revenue come from railways,
trams and water-supply ; and an equal amount
of expenditure goes in rail, tramway, water-
supply and other public works, and salaries
connected therewith. These matters in Britain
are almost wholly left either to private or
municipal enterprise, so they have to be struck
out of the calculation in order to arrive at any-
thing like a fair comparison. More than half
the police and education outlay, and almost the
whole of the cost of State charities is defrayed
in England from local rates, and this difference
of system accounts for another 18s. per head,
or thereabouts, of 'the discrepancy. The
.£670,000 which is expended on the Lands
Department must also be omitted to bring
about a fair comparison, the dear old mother-
country having no Lands Department and
no need of one. Further, an allowance
has to be made for the fact that New South
Wales cannot, by any possibility, hope to put
her public debt on a 2| per cent, basis; the
fact that she cannot offer as security the
guarantee of over 30,000,000 people accounts
for nearly ,£500,000 per annum of her outlay.
And when all these different circumstances are
allowed for, N.S.W., with three times the area
of the United Kingdom and only one-thirtieth
of the population scattered over incalculable
distances, is governed almost as cheaply per
head as the mother - land, and quite as
efficiently. There is still, no doubt, room for
economies, but no amount of legitimate economy
can put the finances on a proper basis. More
revenue, as well as more cheese-paring, is
wanted, and the Land-tax must come, no matter
what happens.
Shxels has partly resigned and partly been
thrown out of the leadership of the Victorian
Opposition, and George Turner has been
appointed in his stead. Shiels has been one
of the bad failures in Australian politics.
He is a tolerably strong man as leader of the
Opposition, but as a Premier he is weighed
down by an awful sense of responsibility, until
he is scared at his own shadow. He is long
and thin and nervous, and belongs to that
order of men who can’t keep their feet still,
and whose hands are always wandering about.
He is too full of Scriptural quotations, and
Spanish proverbs, and great masses of useless
information ; and is so nervously anxious to do
what is right that he seldom manages to do
anything at all. As for George Turner, he is
reputed to be a man of great backbone and
enormous sagacity, just as Patterson and
Carter were reputed before they got a chance
to exhibit their profound and unspeakable
imbecility, and to show that their joint
spine was partly bluff and the restblanc-mange.
How Turner will work as Premier is a
mystery. Victoria is always crying out for a
strong man to come along and save the country,
and he always comes, and when he comes he
generally pans out a dismal failure. The cry
tor a strong man has called forth, in close suc-
cession, Gillies, Munro, Shiels, Graham
Berry, Patterson and Carter, and now it is
to call forth Turner, whose Premiership is
evidently very near at hand. When he goes
wrong Alfred Deakin should be about due
again, and after Deakin is done with the
shining and hairless face of Duncan Gillies
may perhaps be seen coming up the straight
once more.

One of the last acts of the Dibbs Government
was to distribute .£1340 in bonuses to those
civil servants who had come most closely into
official contact with the Ministers. This is the
kind of thing that tames industry and crushes
spirit in the public service. As is usual in such
cases, the fat pig got all the grease. George
Lewis, District Government Officer, with a
salary of =£soo, drew .£5OO as bonus ; Crxtchett
Walker, Principal Under-Secretary, salary
.£lOlO, drew .£100; Sydney Maxted, Director
of Asylums, salary .£740, (with big allowances)
bonus .£5O; Harris Wood, Under-Secretary for
Mines,salary ,£920, bonus ,£lO5 ; J. Greer, Sup-
erintendent of Labourßureau, salary£4oo, bonus
,£5O; and so on. The whole of the money went to
Sydney officials, showing conclusively that the
distribution was merely a piece of Ministerial
favouritism. No doubt the officers favoured
bear a good character, and have done good
work ; but what right has any Ministry to use
public funds to confer favours upon a special
class of public servants, however deserving,
when they are well paid for their work, and
when to single them.out for special reward does
injustice to a much larger number of officials
who have worked equally well ? The Bulletin
has no hesitation in saying that hundreds of
school-teachers and telegraph - operators (to
quote no other class), who work now at reduced
and inadequate salaries of ,£lOO a year or so,
are far more deserving of consideration than
well-paid departmental heads with a host of
underlings to do their drudgery. That any
Government should be able so complacently to
dispense such unfair patronage shows how
seriously the sense of public justice in Australia
has been undermined by a long course of
political corruption.
In Melbourne, the other day, a young man,
never before convicted of any offence, was
found guilty of stealing 55., and sent to gaol
for nine months. The very same day, at
Ballarat, in the same province and under the
same code of laws, a hulking, six-foot, 15-stone
ruffian was convicted of smashing the nose of
his aged mother and otherwise brutally assault-
ing her. He also made a violent attack on a
man who interfered on the poor old Woman’s
behalf, and fought “like a wild beast” when
taken into custody. Further, he was an old
offender, who had been previously convicted of
assaulting the same bruised and wretched
parent —and he got one month. Therefore,
according to Victorian law and logic, it is
nine times as wicked to steal ss. as to half-kill

an aged mother—for the second or third time,
with assault on a casual stranger and a general
free fight thrown in. Moreover, the court,
when it gave the mother-smasher one month,
was in a state of fierce indignation and used so
much strong language that it evidently con-
sidered it was inflicting a really tremendous
sentence, while the bench which sent up the
petty thief for nine months was perfectly ealm
and composed. Had their mental conditions
been reversed it is difficult to imagine how
much the petty swindler and how very little
the brutal-assault person might have got.
Truly we are a brutal nation, and the worst
brutes are on the magisterial bench.
Tee New South Wales military forces possess
in the present Parliament three majors—
Wright, Chapman and Gould —one captain
— Millard, and one lieutenant— Shipway.
Nevertheless, the military are supposed to be
excluded from the exercise of political influence
in the territory, and there are many more
reasons why such an exclusion should be effec-
tive than apply to officials in other depart-
ments of public service. If, however, the
military may enjoy the privilege of instructing
Parliament on the amount of money which
should be spent on the physical-force arm of
the State, on what grounds of consistency is
exclusion enforced against officials in the State
school and Police service?
The shearing dispute continues, with steadily
preponderating odds on the side of the
squatters, by whose glaring breach of faith
the quarrel was brought about. Crowds of
Maorilanders are now being imported to
take the bread out of Australian mouths;
and these go about their work with a persis-
tence on which neither persuasion nor threat
make any impression. Perhaps partly by
reason of climate, perhaps partly on account
of their larger admixture of sturdy Scotch-
ness, Maorilanders show enterprising stability
which workers on this side of the water
have yet to attain. The average Maori-
lander takes wages only that he may save and
become a land-owner and employer by-and-bye;
the average Australian is too often content to
remain a wages-man all his life. If all the
money that has been spent fruitlessly in Aus-
tralian strikes had been devoted to settling the
strikers on the land, the condition of labour
generally would be far better than it
is at present; since the labour market
would have been relieved, while, at the
same time, the demand for labour was
increased. There is nothing to be made out of
strikes. There is still less to be made out of
anarchy. And until the shearers have sufficient
self-control to pass from wages-slavery into
independence, their misfortunes will remain in
as large a measure due to their own indiscretion
as to the hungry aggressiveness of associated
pastoralism,
“ Young Nick ” Willis, the evil genius of the
N.S.W. Protectionist party, who got in for the
Barwon (N.S.W.) by two votes, must have
spent three really days over the
election. When the first result arrived he was
a good way behind, but the returns came in
slowly from the outlying parts of the huge,
straggling electorate, and as each one arrived
there was another change in the position of
affairs. At last he found himself just one vote
ahead, and then there was an agonising
wait of nearly a day for the final return
wdiich was to decide everything. It arrived
at last by a tired messenger on a broken-down
horse, and Willis was in by two votes. The
episode, though it ended satisfactorily for
Willis, is reminiscent of an old story of the
Spanish Inquisition. A heretic was sentenced
to be burned, but no date was fixed for the
ceremony. One night the gaoler, apparently
by accident, left the door of his cell unfastened,
and he got out and stole down a dimly-lighted
corridor. There he suddenly came upon two
monks.conversing, and with his hair standing up
and a cold perspiration streaming down his face
he backed silently into a niche and waited. The
monks paced back and forward past his hiding
place but seemingly never noticed him. Then
they stopped right opposite him, and talked
long and earnestly about all manner of horrible
things, and the anguished wretch stood rigid in
his corner unnoticed, and waited. At last they
went away, and then he sneaked down the
corridor till he found a heavily-barred window,
and beside it, as if by some special dispensation
of Providence, a crowbar. All night he toiled
desperately to remove the bars, no one disturb-
ing him, though every half-hour or so the watch
came so near him that he nearly fainted with
terror. Finally, in the early dawn he got
through and fled down the street, looking for a
place of refuge. As he fled he ran against an
old friend, who greeted him with a wild cry of
joyous recognition, and hurried him away to his
house, where a safe refuge was available/When
they arrived there they went into the cellar,
then through a trap-door in the cellar floor and
down a flight of steps, then along a passage
and up some more steps and through more
corridors till they arrived at a stone-built room.
There the friend left him, promising to return
with food and drink, and locking the door
behind him for security, and it was only when
the prisoner heard a yell of hoarse laughter
through the keyhole that he realised that he
was back in the same cell he had quitted the
night before, and that the faggots were being
got ready for him. The “ escape ” had all been
arranged: the open door, and the talking
monks, and the providential crowbar, and the
timely friend all were in the scheme of
the tortures of the Inquisition. If the
last return had put W. N. Willis two
behind his antagonist instead of two in
front of him, that story would have just
about expressed his position. And if his elec-
tion should chance to be upset on petition,
as often happens in the case of infinitesimal
majorities, it will express his position to a
hair. Also, if it doesn’t express his position
this time, it will next time, or the time after
that, or some other time. Almost every poli-
tician, in his old age, finds himself poor and out
of date and discarded, and discovers that he has
got back by devious ways to the cell he started
from. Only one in a thousand or so makes any-
thing out of the game. Even the man who
starts from a shoemaker’s last generally gets
back to the last in the end, and then finds he
has forgotten to make shoes.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
August 21, 1894.
My Dear Moorabinda—
Major the Hon. Rupert Leigh, A.D.0., is billed
to leave Sydney per Orient on Monday next,
and go ’Omewards over the billowy ocean which
he crossed hitherwards as plain captain and unat-
tached bachelor in the tram of his brother-in-law,
“George,” Earl of Jersey. Now he leaves us
metamorphosed into an engaged major, and Syd-
ney society will honestly mourn his loss, for
brother Rupert No. 2 was pretty popular, not only
with the inevitable popularity of a Government
House young man, whoever he is, but because he
was a rubicund and jovial youth, whose eyeglass
never fell into the soup and who looked on good
terms with every day in the week. As an amateur
actor, brother Rupert No. 2 will leave a dreary
gap in Government House theatricals, and if he
has made any enemies they must have burst into
bloom since he took the onerous billet of private
secretary to Gov. Duff. The lady, for instance,
who wrote on musk-scented pink paper to say
that Woolloomooloo was not adequately repre-
sented at Government House, “so would the
secretary kindly send a card ?” and others of her
ilk would not weep wildly if his vessel met a
waterspout or a sea-serpent half-way. As every-
body knows, Major Leigh is engaged to pretty
Miss Ida G files.
By the way, N.S.W. Governors seem particu-
larly fortunate in the youths they hit on to share
the toils of office. 1 can’t remember an esclandre
where a Government House “suite” was very
much concerned ; not publicly, at least, though I
mind me of a famous in camera divorce-case when
the name of an A.D.C. was freely canvassed in
many drawing-rooms; and everybody remembers
when the curtain went up too soon at the Theatre
Royal, and a Governor’s son was discovered
sitting on a chair in the middle of the stage with
a coryphee on his knee.
But, as a general thing, the Sydney aspect of a
Government House “suite” is almost faultless.
When he finally renounces his facings and goes
’Ome he is generally engaged to be married, and
the ceremony comes off, too, which is more to
the point. Indeed, it almost looks as if N.S.W.
were a matrimonial snare into which sprigs of
nobility walked, with their eyes open, and were
never seen alive as bachelors again. And speak-
ing of the wholesale marrying of aides-de-camp
reminds me that I haven’t heard anything about
Captain Cholmondeley’s wedding. His pretty
Sydney bride-to-be went home boasting of he
purpose last November, so I suppose the knot i r
s
firmly tied ere although the awful particulars
haven t reached Australia yet in a general sense.
The freshest Southern scandal concerns a dash-
ing and fatally fascinating youth who has been
tearing about in great style for a brief season, on
the strength of being Somebody’s cousin, and the
reputation of having torn untold wealth out of
the bowels of a Western gold mine. He was
extremely popular (of course) in the very best
society, and his picnics in four-horse drags were
patronised by people whose names are household
words to advertisers of “distinguished patronage”
lists. And now the bubble has burst, not thro’
a lady, but on account of an importunate person,
who has shown society the empty pockets of the
supposed “millionaire.”
I hear that Cardinal Moran had a narrow escape
recently from losing his handsomely-jewelled ring
which the faithful are privileged to kiss on certain
specified occasions. The police heard that one or
two Sydney thieves had planned to join in the
ceremony and dexterously slip the jewel off the
Cardinal’s finger when he extended it to them to
kiss, trusting to luck to escape in the confusion.
However, the speculators either gave up the idea
or else the presence of a well-known detective on
the scene damped their sacrilegious ardour, for no
attempt was made. Some hungry person will be
trying to get away with the Pope’s toe next, I
suppose.
Some members of the “ Suds,” alias the Sydney
University Dramatic Society, disguised themselves
in woolly wigs (have you ever noticed that no
amateur ever feels made up without a woolly wig,
whereas your “ real ” actor piously avoids wearing
-ome other sheep’s hair—Sara Bernhardt’s natural
<hatch became quite a nuisance) and came forth in
two plays, “Harmony” and “The Wedding
March,” at Sydney Standard to the satisfaction
of a fairly full theatre. Perhaps the most lasting
point of interest about the “Suds’” latest show
lay in the fact that it was the first performance
got up in aid of the Women’s College since that
high-priced and unnecessary edifice was set a-going
by the Governor. It is a moral certainty it won’®
be the last, however. Priends and active sym-
pathisers with that horse-leech’s daughter in stucco
are strongly advised to take lessons in skirt-
dancing and parlour music so as to be armed at all
points. Any society lady whose heart bleeds for
the cause and who can turn a drawing-room flip-
flap discreetly or otherwise, is likely to be worth
her weight in brass to the Women’s College when
it begins to discover just how insolvent it is.
In the first piece (“Harmony”), Mr. Gregan
M‘Mahon, as the blind and inebriate organist, was
the little tin-god of the curtain-raiser. His make-
up was excellent, and he played so artistically
from first to last, that he almost seemed like a
professional got in to show the amateurs up. I
think Mr. M'lntyre was too unfeelingly boyish
for an ideal jeune-premier, but Mr. E. B. Dalton,
as a bailiff in a misfit wig, was most amusing, and
Miss Caro, as the heroine, played her part in a
very natural and pretty way.
The “Wedding March” lasted longer, and
went with a spank, but what I particularly noticed
was the high average of good-looking performers.
For instance, it would take a lot of paint to make
Mr. A. B. Davies play Caliban convincingly, and
even a wig like a scarlet bottle-brush couldn’t
conceal Pickburn’s loveliness. And the ladies —
beginning with Miss Beatrice Roper-Elliot (who
made her last appearance on the amateur stage as
a bride before making a real appearance shortly
in the same rble), looked like gleanings from a
suburban beauty-show. An exception is made
in favour of one artiste in a tomato frock,
who hung her hands (by the way, when a
girl thinks of her hands on the stage she’s
done for ; hams are nothing in comparison to
how her small sixes feel). I will not criticise the
acting, for honours were tolerably even in “ The
Wedding March”—but I really was struck by the
youth and beauty of our leading stock company of
amateurs. Take the light and airy Duke, for
example (Mr. J. P. Jones), whose well-turned
profile was so excellently stage-managed.
The newly-organised ’Varsity orchestra, led by
a Johnny in white-kid gloves, played taking tunes
in a most unimpeachable manner and fitted into
all the gaps. Time which mellows the fiddle does
the same for the fiddler, and though the ’Varsity
orchestra was a little coltish here and there, as is
inevitable with so brand-new a society, I, at any-
rate, never expect to hold my shell-like ear when
its tootle rises on the breeze. Talking of
orchestras, a musical man, who recently arrived in
Sydney as avant-courier for Somebody’s little
show, told me that he would have included one in
his programme only such a thing as a professional
orchestra isn’t available in Sydney! Signor
Hazon tried his best to provoke one into popularity
at Sydney Exhibition Building, but it lapsed for
want of support. At present Sydney relies on
amateurs to satisfy any orchestral yearnings it
may happen to feel in the region of its soul.
Miss Hilda Spong’s benefit at Sydney Criterion,
on 14th inst., was more a society than a public
function. Mrs. Hutton, accompanied by her “repre-
sentative ” (in a collar to her ears) and her mamma
lent tone tothed.c.; the Misses Duff were exhibited
in theo.p. box vis h vis to Mrs. “Jack” Wood
(Essie Jenyns), who played the part of bottle-
holder, so to speak, to Miss Spong in a most un-
mistakeable manner. There was a long pro-
gramme. Mons. Deslouis made a success of “ Les
Rarneaux,” though the orchestra squeaked at
every crisis; Mr. J. E. Sykes played his musicianly
“Canala” waltz on an unworthy piano; Elsie
Cameron and Nellie Young, Frank Adams, Harry
Rickards, all sang. There was an act of
“ Friends,” an act of the “ Lion’s Heart,” recita-
tions by Mr. Mayne and Mr. Campbell (who looks
like Frank Thornton in “ Mama ”), and then the
climax—the balcony-scene from “ Romeo and
.Juliet.”
Pretty Hilda Spong, in clinging white silk and
pearl trimmings, played the love-sick maiden very
convincingly to Harry Plimmer’s somewhat smug-
profiled Romeo. It would be difficult for an actress
of such ingenuous prettiness as Miss Spong to
play Juliet otherwise than acceptably. Youth
and profile go a long way in Juliet’s case, and it
is my belief that any pretty actress not so ab-
solutely indifferent to tender emotions as the
Yellow-Aster girl would always make a fair hit in
the balcony-scene. At the end the audience rose
and pelted thebeneficiare with flowers (a well-known
merchant of theatrical sympathies went round
dealing out cut flowers to the ladies who had come
unprovided). Baskets and bouquets covered the
stage, and though a great many floralities missed
their mark and fell among thieves, some of the
women made unerring shots—especially Essie
Jenyns Wood, who almost hit the bull’s-eye with a
bunch of arum lilies.
Ihe mistake of this floral finale (amid what
seemed to me to be rather pumped-up enthusiasm
if 1 must speak the golden truth) was Miss Spong’s
speech. As a young and untried actress, making
her way to unprejudiced London to be “put in
your right place,” as Nellie Stewart calls it, Miss
Spong s most diplomatic course was to have been
too full for words, and simply panted emotionally
in white satin. Society, her committee, and her
dear, dear public could have been better thanked
per medium of a well-considered and artful advt.
Businesslike and perfunctory gratitude, which is
always more or less cataloguish and unconvincing
has a much better effect in formal print than when
coolly and correctly stated by a maiden whose
words seem too deep for her alleged feelings. Ada
Crossley’s farewell, when she sniffed and wiped
her eyes on her white kid gloves, is what the
public likes.
‘Morocco Bound,” which we are promised
presently, will serve to introduce two pretty Syd-
ney girls (the eldest of whom has been the belle
of many_ a society ball, but whose most prominent
histrionic effort was a skirt-dance at a matinhe a
few years ago, when the effect was more like an
insurrection in the laundry than anything else)
into active stage-life. They have only to come on
with banners and go off again to nervously powder
their noses all over afresh, as is the invariable
habit of beginners, finding their stage feet in the
depths of the back row ; but as both are going to
stick to the footlights, I hope the banner business
will be a very brief experience. “Miss Ham-
mond” (Miss Bessie Tarrant) also comes on in
, Morocco Bound,” in all the dignity of a speak-
ing part.
The seventh production of “ Ma’mzelN
Nitouche,” at Sydney Lyceum, was a shade
different to the first, owing to a new abbess (who
got stuck in her “responses ”) in Elsie Cameron***
place, which she filled as neatly as a pint of plums
fills a quart pot. Otherwise the “eccentricity’
(it s 18 years old, by the way) went spicily—
especially the dance in the middle-act, when four
girls in black skirts, with coloured linings over
white lace petticoats and frilled etceteras, go
through a sort of can-can, ending up with the
collapse, like a house of cards, of the damsels in
the position of so many wide-open scissors. It’s
certainly the most anatomical ballet Australia
has been faced with so far, and takes the belt
from the Fin de Si&cle ballet, which has hitherto
topped our record for that sort of thing.
After the green-room dance (but why, I wonder,
do the ballerinas look as solemn as fowls on a
roost when they’re standing on one foot ? Four
woodeney, smileless women manipulating their
legs like railway-signals centralize the suggestive-
ness of their little show far more than if they
brought a few coquetries of facial expression into
play. If the stalls were waiting to see if she was
going to wink at them or not her gymnastics
“would probably become a mere matter of detail.”)
But, as I was saying before I interrupted myself,
after the green-room dance the Tableaux-vivants
seem quite irreproachable.
Society appears to take kindly to the living
pictures, and though I saw a posse of women
hovering near the d.c. entrance on the first night
prepared to take to their heels if a fig-leaf had
been forgotten anywhere, not a soul stirred on
Saturday. But I haven’t met a woman yet who
likes the tableaux-vivauts. A “model” female
who reduces her stage wardrobe to an absurdity
and thereby attracts the breathless scrutiny of
every man in the house, doesn’t act as a magnet
on her own sex, somehow. There is a certain
amount of indignation, I suppose, at having to sit
huddled up in the dark like sheep while another
woman has a forty-foot stage and limelight effects
all to herself. And when you come to think, it
must be a little trying to be a diffident spinster in
the audience supported by a pair of well-turned
legs which Mrs. Grundy forbids her to advertise
higher than the ankle, harkening to the masculine
applause going on over somebody not half so
shapely. The poseuses were not a feminine
success. “Thank goodness they’re not Aus-
tralian models 1” I heard one woman say viciously,
from which I inferred that it’s lucky for the great
majority that women like Mona Rathbone aren’t
an indigenous product.
Do you know, I would like to suggest an im-
provement in the setting of those posings ? The
rich gold frame is well enough for the pictures, but
it is quite superfluous for the statuary and doesn’t
help the effect one bit. Whoever saw a framed
Venus? If the statues simply loomed out of un-
relieved blackness they would be by far the most
artistic portion of the show. The frame, by the
way, projected too far on Saturday and the pall-
like curtain kept on hitching up to the O.P. side.
There was quite a flutter every time it stuck.
Visions of rose-pink or chalky maidens hopping off
their pedestals in a hurry caused a rush to that,
side of the theatre which would have given an.
English mail-boat a list to starboard.
The jig held by the full strength of the Sydney
steamship companies, including Howard Smith
and Sons, U.S.S. Co., A.U.S.N., Orient Co.,
P. and 0., Norddeutscher Lloyd, Messageries
Maritimes, Gennan-Australian, and I don’t know
how many more, made its deMt at the Paddington
Town Hall last Monday evening (20th), and was
the greatest success imaginable. I have seldom
seen the hall so jauntily decorated : there w'ere
enough flags (including the Australian banner
which Sir Precedent Scott used to nag us so for
flaunting) to trim a dozen regattas, and the ren-
dezvous were life-buoys and crossed oars and
other nautical insignia. The music by Kerr’s
popular band (with Signor Franca for the extras—
the s.s. companies don’t worry their guests to
thump the interpolated dances while the band is
refreshing itself) was good throughout, and the
supper-tables, decorated with daffodils, heather,
snowdrops, and ferns (not to mention more
material things), were open all the evening.
Messrs. Newman (Howard Smith and Sons),
Burgess (U.S.S.A.), Harvey and Desjardins
(Messagcries), who were the originators of the
affair, must have viewed their work with com-
placency. I set my note of admiration against
the steamship companies’ dance anyway.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

“ My Jack,” by the wildly-gifted Benjamin
Landeck, was presented on Saturday at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, amid a glare of red flame
from the exploded lighthouse, and various other
upheavals, bursts and decorations. “My Jack ”
belongs to that good old school of melodrama in
which the wicked baronet is resolved to recover
the incriminating papers at any cost. All through
six desperate acts he wades through slaughter
after these papers, which always elude him, like
that bright idea which we have when we wake up
in the morning. They were originally found along
with a drowned woman on the beach. Next, they
were hidden for 20 years inside the undershirt of a
wicked Greek. Later they are planted in a
ruined mill, where they are unearthed by an
escaped convict, who gives them to his sister.
Then they get on board ship by accident, and the
Greek just misses them. The real owner proceeds
to hand them over to the wicked baronet, but by
pure accident gives him a packet of tobacco in-
stead, and he is again discomfited. About this
time the pursuit of the lost papers grows dreadful
in its intensity. But at last the Greek dies three
times in the desert, and when he recovers for the
fourth time he explains things; and a British
army appears walking through the Sahara; and
the lost British flag proves to be safe inside George
Rignold’s waistcoat; and the missing birth-certi-
ficate is found at the bottom of the funny man’s
trunk, and everybody gives three cheers for the
British constitution. Then G. Rignold goes Home
and becomes the real baronet.
* • •
The legal discrepancies of “ My Jack” are
truly powerful. Nobody seems to know why the
wicked baronet should be trampled upon by the
oily Greek merely because the latter has the birth
certificate, seeing that anyone could get an equally
good one at the Registrar’s office for 2s. fid. And
it is never explained why the real heir should come
into the estate as soon as hegets the said document,
as the birth certificates of all the British peerage
are obtainable on application, accompanied by the
necessary fee. And when the convict is murdered
in the mill for the sake of the same memorable
publication it is sorrowful to reflect that he might
as well have been murdered for a paper bag.
Other notable facts are that the desert is of a
howling, blood-red hue; that the Greek who found
Mr. Rignold, along with the papers, in his infancy
looks considerably younger than the aforesaid
foundling ; and that when the lighthouse explodes
the top of it blows up among the flies and never
comes down again. Mr. Rignold as “My Jack’’
—Miss Athena Claudius’s Jack—is by no means
at his best, and the lady with the Groeco-Roman
cognomen is altogether too feeble for her part.
Harry Leston makes an acceptable funny man
who is really funny in places, which most funny
men are not; and two fine samples of robust villainy
are supplied by Messrs. Scot Inglis and_ Marsh,
as the wicked baronet and the Greek. _Miss Kate
Bishop also makes a stately and pathetic figure as
a blind mother. The piece is mounted in first-
class style, and a number of touching allusions to
our noble Queen, and that sort of thing, are
worked in here and there.
** * *
Arthur Garner’s comedy co. closect its
season at Sydney Criterion with one night of the
damp and tear-sodden “East Lynne.” As a really
wailful drama, suitable for the funeral of an un-
lucky season, “East Lynne” undoubtedly fills
the bill. The one thing which could be said for
it is that the stupendous Garner and his co. played
it for all there was in it, and—in its own desolate
fashion—it took well. There are four mournful
things in this world—a homeless orphan lost in
the snow; a blind mother weeping over her dead
child; a manual labourer in spectacles; and
“East Lynne.” And the saddest of them all is
“East Lynne.”
** * *
The Comic Opera Co. proposes to depart
from the Lyceum and from Sydney at the end of
next week. Nellie Stewart goes with it, so the
local johnny’s life will shortly be but a vale of dry
bones. Meanwhile, “ Mdlle. Nitouche ”is going
strong, and the fact that the ballet is exceedingly
blue and sinful, and that the living pictures are
in a shocking state of nakedness, becomes more and
more apparent every time they are inspected.
The Bulletin has inspected them more conscien-
tiously than it ever inspected anything before, and
speaks as one having authority, and not as'the
scribes. Owing to these and other circumstances
the front entrance at 7.30 every evening looks
like Xerxes’s army going upstairs in furious
haste on its way to Greece.
** * *
“Morocco Bound,” under the manage-
ment of the Maomahons, goes up at the Lyceum
on September 1. The beloved Billy Elton is
leading humorist, and the cast also includes Wil-
fred Shine, a man of much repute in dear old
Hingland; Misses Nannie Harding (a lady who
has left an impressive footprint as a prima donna
in many Gilbertian operas), Aggie Kelton, Edna
Grace, Courtenay (formerly of D’Oyley Carte’s
Co.), and others. Likewise there is a chorus 44
strong, some fine scenery by Gordon, <£looo worth
of imported costumes, and a lot of very excellent
music.
** * *
“ Aunt Jack ” follows “ Mrs. Tanqueray
at Melbourne Princess’s with as much appro-
priateness as a punch-and-judy show coming after
a funeral. It is an endless series of complications
arising out of two barristers quartered in the same
office, and an unnatural confusion of clients. The
aunt of the younger barrister forms a hasty attach-
ment for his bald bachelor companion, who some-
how avoids the knowledge that this riotous angel
is suing one of his clients for breach of promise.
The client, a military person with a spasmodic
snort, has meanwhile become engaged to the
Murkan widow of a pork-dealer, and the widow is
led into sundry misunderstandings through the im-
becility of an irrelevant johnnie. Also the secretly
married wife of the other barrister gets much wor-
ried by impossiblecircumstances, and together with
the pig-merchant’s relict is invariably suspecting
something that didn’t happen. A red-headed at-
torney serves a purely extraneous purpose by falling
over a leather bag and standing up to be pelted
with French rolls, whilst an elderly office-boy is
remarkable for being smacked across the ears by
the name-character. The third and last scene in
this sad mystery is enacted in a law-court, where
Aunt Jack brings her action against the snorting
warrior, and her new beau appears for the defen-
dant. It is “ Trial by Jury ” sans Gilbert and
Sullivan. The iury shake hands with the plaintiff,
and the only rational feature of the proceedings
is a pressman, presumably drunk, who slumbers
in the reporters’ pew. After Aunt Jack has sung
% comic song and the court has roared a chorus, it
occurs to the judge that somebody is creating a
disturbance, wherefore he orders the speechless
journalist to be chucked out. Properly the cur-
tain should descend on this fairly amusing inci-
dent. Nothing in the nature of a dramatic climax
occurs subsequently.
• « •
There is more force than humour in “Aunt
Jack.” The story opens with too much plot, and
terminates in a dense fog of fooling. A recollec-
tion of poor Titheradge, shrinking under his
burden of shame as the Judge in this hybrid enter-
tainment, haunts one all the way home. Brough,
who met with a huge reception, makes the most of
the bachelor barrister, whilst his brother-manager is
alively exponent of the red-headed character. Cecil
Ward has the one natural light-comedy part, and
rattles through it pleasantly, but Renouf, Frank-
lyn, and Miss Temple are not all that they might
be. Moreover, Mrs. Brough wants the breadth of
style necessary to a successful performance of
Aunt Jack, and if she had the necessary physique
and natural violence she couldn’t save the piece
from the jaws of oblivion. On Saturday the
B. and B. company will appear in Jones’ “Bauble
Shop.”

George Darrell, the calm detective, is still
hunting down Lowry’s gang at Melbourne Royal.
On the other hand, Lowry and the gang continue
to track George as though he were a dangerous
character, instead of treating his intuitive know-
ledge with contempt and leaving him to smoke his
cigar in peace. Sometimes George reveals Dan
Lowry’s identity by pulling his wig off, and some-
times Dan scalps George for a like purpose, but
neither hero can show any potent cause for his
exciting behaviour. Another odd circumstance is
old man Cathcart, who has lived within reach of
the intrepid Daniel for a quarter of a century
without once attempting to clutch him by the
throat. The dream of his life is to grip
the miscreant’s wind-pipe, yet he never does
it. If he attempted anything of the kind, Dan
would kill him —kill him right thar, and don’t you
forget it. The tank has supported “ The Crimson
Thread ” thus far, but when Dr. Carver fell into
a stage river on horseback he knocked the bottom
out of all subsequent tank business as far as Mel-
bourne is concerned. “Hearts of Oak” is the
bill for Saturday.
*# * *
At the Alexandra, where the spirit of
desolation wanders up and down the avenues of
bare benches, wringing its grisly hands, Dan
Barry is giving them “ Missing at Lloyd’s.” The
coffin-ship nightly rocks in the cradle of the deep,
and the gallant sailor-lad turns up from his
watery grave with an ardour worthy of a much
more satisfactory attendance.
*% * *
Melbourne Opera Club started its three
more performances of the “ Gondoliers ” at the
Bijou on Saturday, strengthened by previous ex-
perience and patronised by the reigning Excellency.
Signorina Orelli, who played Casilda with good
effect at the first, was altogether better this time,
and Miss Marion Dovan likewise stood out con-
spicuously from a crowd of improved amateurs.
Even the dancing, which is often the saddest
portion of a club’s display, was equal to taking a
double encore for the gay eachuca. This well-
organised outbreak of stage madness was to close
on Tuesday with a benefit to musical director
James Ure, an entirely new cast having been
chosen from the ranks. An amateur opera com-
pany seems to be a Napoleonic army in the sense
that every knap-sack contains a field-marshal’s
baton.
** * *
Talmage has delivered his four or five
lectures in Melbourne and moved on to other
places where he hasn’t yet been found out.
Several vast audiences heard that apostolic mum-
mer read his bursts of oratory from bits of paper
when he wasn’t retailing decayed anecdotes from
memory, and the general opinion is unfavourable.
The devouring stranger is reckoned an artistic
failure, like Katie Putnam and “Evangeline,”
and many other things that pass for great in
Amurrika. His “lectures” are but low comedy
sermons for Christian young men; his doctrines
dodge the main point; the brazen effrontery of his
elocution is not even new to some hearers. It was
to be heard in London bethels 20 years ago, and
no intelligent citizen, having come across it once,
felt anxious to encounter the unmeaning tumult
ever again. If the voice of the people be the
voice of God it is quite evident that the Almighty
doesn’t commission Talmage to go on tour.
** * *
Melbourne’s new ’all, the Oxford, was
opened by the Coghill Bros, on Saturday. The
attendance totted up to 2000 souls, or thereabouts,
and so many people went out to get a drink dur-
ing the interval that the last of them had barely
time to return before the performance closed. On
an emergency, however, the building could be
cleared in three minutes. Drink not being an
emergency, the escape-doors are not provided with
keepers entitled to issue checks, hence the stream
of humanity gets wedged in the gangway, and
the rush for refreshment goes slow. At the
Alhambra, a large crowd assembled in honour of
Harry Rickards, and that inextinguishable
vocalist seemed to be as popular as of old.

The Melb. Risregliato Society 'shows scope
in its choice of exceptional. At its preceding
concert it introduced little Percy Grainger to the
public; at its last, the other night, “ Herr
Friedrich Moosßrugger ’’—the exact counterpart
of old Father Christmas, flowing white hair and
beard, and smiling benevolence all over his rosy
face, just as though he had stepped freshly out
of a fairy tale, and with the most charming and
courteous manners befitting the part. There was
quite a glow of enquiry all over the room when
his magnificent voice died away in two lovely
songs of Schumann’s. Wherever had so finished
an artist been hiding ? It was generally decided
that he had been wafted hitherwards from the
innermost recesses of some deep German forest.
At Poverty Point.
Melbournian: “Smythe is a mighty destroyer of illu-
sions, and I have seen it written somewhere that he
would have knocked all the stuffing out of the most
terrible character in history, by simply exhibiting
* Robespierre,’ in 24-sheet streamers, red letters, on the
dead walls. Fancy Napoleon being Smythed—toted
round the globe, after a spell of St. Helena 1 I shudder
at the idea that Dante, Goethe, or even Shakespeare, not
to mention anyone else, might have fallen into his hands.
Charles Warner and daughter, Grade, recently played
an act of “ Ingomar” at a London matinee, with vast
success. Warner is at his best in old-fashioned heroic
characters, and Grade, who was always rrblessly pic-
turesque, appears to be gaining strength.
Sara Bernhardt is said to be making more money than
she ever made before, and even to be holding a little of it.
Lilia Wilde suddenly “seceded ” from_ the company at
Melb. Alexandra the other Friday, and little Dora Mostyn
played Lady Isabel in “ East Lynne ” at an hour s notice.
Dora, the street-arab impersonatress, in the part of a
remorseful heroine was rather suggestive of Jennie Lee
as the Second Mrs. Tanqueray.
The worst of being a theatrical critic is that the in-
evitable actress comes along.
Tom Grundy, doyen of the Williamson and Musgrove
Opera Co., is no more. He came in mediaeval times, with
the Soldenes, over whom the fossiliferous Brummels are
prodigal in winks. Tom was always parsonic, regarded as
a sort of father confessor to the troupe, with the oil-can,
after Johnny Wallace at rehearsal. Indeed, he was a
sturdy, honest mediocrity, with an understanding that
duty reigned even in the business of pleasure, so that he
was as reliable as Cathcart. To be sure, the public might
ask for a little ginger, but Tom would doubtless reply,
like a Drury Lane veteran. “ What do they want? Always
neat, always perfect, and wig combed not an hour ago.”
Mdlle. Yvette Guilbert gets £4O a night at London
Empire for singing chansons. Her enunciation is singu-
larly lucid, and her face mobile ; her voice, though not
powerful, is thoroughly at her command. Her gestures
are few and simple, but her facial play is extraordinary,
and more suggestive than the words of her songs. Yet
she is very ugly. Her figure is thin, her neck long, and
she admits she has “no bust.” Yet, without the charms
of flowing curves, she gets a higher fee than any other
music-hall artist in the world.
Florence Saville (says The Bulletin’s London corre-
spondent) sang at the State concert at Buckingham
Palace this week with great success. She is undoubtedly
a very fine artiste. She was also heard at Mrs. Lennox
Browne’s at-home, where she sang a duet with Signor
Alvarez, which fairly entranced the company present.
By the way, Lennox Browne manages to get all the swell
professionals to perform at his house. He is most suc-
cessful in treating singers’ sore-throats, and as he does
not charge fees to professionals, the return they make is
to amuse his wife’s guests on her at-home_days. Lennox
himself is no mean musician, and he also is an admirable
painter. A real good all-round man, in fact.
A correspondent: “I heard Cecily Staunton sing* See
How it Sparkles ’ at a fashionable Auckland (M.L.) con-
cert ten years ago—long before she met Herr Goldenstedt.
I rather think that Madame Donovan, of Sydney, but
formerly organist at St. Benedict’s R.C. church, Auck-
land, was the tuneful Cecily’s first instructress.”
Madame Rose Hersee is the sister of a popular Sydney
•ea-captain of the same name.
The Tableaux Vivants, at Sydney Lyceum, are the most
artistic thing in feminine confectionery ever offered to a
tasteful public. The only objection is that no man with
one pair of eyes can watch each of three Graces at once.
Luscombe Searelle (says The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent by last mail) has grown at least a foot in stature
during the week. It happens that he was the first “ Uit-
lander ” who was commandeered in the Transvaal, and he
only escaped compulsory service by volunteering. He is
thus supposed to know all about the subject which is in
dispute between the Boer Government and the British,
and consequently he has been “commandeered ” to inter-
view Lord Ripon and to give his opinion on things in
general connected with the Transvaal and Swaziland. Ho
has seen the Colonial Minister several times, and is alto-
gether for the moment a very great man at Downing-
street.
Snazelle, at latest, was playing at the Egyptian Hall,
Piccadilly, “on his own,” during the temporary absence
of Maskelyne and Cook.

again a professional concert-singer in London.
Courtneidge was playing at Nottingham last month, as
leading man in Kate Vaughan’s dramatic co.
One Billy Wilson, with the Georgia Minstrels, had a
carpet-sack mouth equal to Talmage, but Irving Sayles
and Martyn Hagan are “ not in it.”
Dear Bulletin,— The other day you mentioned that the
natural sequence to the presentation of actor Henry
Irving at Court (which did not come off, after all) would be
the present ation of the female Thespian. A cousin of Lord
Randolph Churchill, who has a very fair reputation as a
provincial actress, has already been presented at a Royal
drawing-room, and Essie Jenyns has had the same honour,
but both of these cases turn on the question—When does
a woman begin or end her acting?— M’lsaacs.
When Talmage was in Sj-dney, that meek and lowly
shepherd hung out at the Australia Hotel. There he was
set down by those who met him in private life as a rather
aggressive shepherd, and the friendly gash which passed
for a smile on the stage changed into a reserved and
forbidding gulch. Talmage’s geniality is mostly a public
emotion, and he doesn't use it much in private.
Rdjane, the Parisienne, has made a tremendous London
hit in Sardou’s “Madame Sans 66ne.” Incisive Archer
describes her as combining flashes of Rehan, Mrs. Ban-
croft, and Lottie Venne, with splendid originality.
Pinero, it is said, will write the libretto for Sullivan’s
next opera, but a third party will supply the lyrics.
Pinero has a Gilbertian vein of satire anyway, and might
turn out some quaint verse as well as prose, one would
imagine. Perhaps he lacks the ear.
Harwood holds the cake for stage “ gags.” At old
Melb. Royal, just after his return from a trip “home,”
he came before the curtain wearing a full beard and made
a little speech. Then he rushed off to get a shave, and
presently re-appeared as Cassandra in “The Siege of
Troy.” Actors all agree that this was a great “gag,”
although they can’t explain whether the “ gag ” was the
beard, or the smooth face, or the shave behind the scenes.
What is a “ gag ?”
Melba has made a hit at the Handel Festival, at the
Crystal Palace. Her singing in oratorio was a revelation
to those who thought her voice not quite suited for that
style of music.
People fancy the “Second Mrs. Tanqueray” is over in
two hours, whereas it takes three.
“ Melba and De Reszke are as completely in accord as
Grisi and Mario.”— London Paper.
The gem of Massenet’s “La Navarraise ” is the Noc-
turne, while the empty stage changes from night to morn
—suggested by Mascagni’s intermezzo.
Miss Fortescue cleared, they say, nearly £sooo_by her
English provincial tour with “Hypatia.” On dit, also,
that Baroness Burdett Coutts finances her. They are
great friends in private life. As the world knows, Miss
Fortescue’s real name is Finney, and she is daughter of a
quondam wealthy coal-merchant who went “broke.” Her
mother, writes a Bulletin correspondent, is a delightful
old lady, and May herself is charming. There is another
sister, Maud Ferrers, who is even better-looking than the
adorable May, which is saying a lot.
The Bulletin’s London correspondent doesn’t think
that Arthur Roberts will be seen in Australia with “ Don
Juan.” He has too big a following in England to make
it worth his while to lose touch with his local clientele.
Edward Terry tells The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent that he has made up his mind to pay another
visit “down-under,” but not immediately. He will take
out something' fresh, but will not attempt burlesque,
which is too exacting for a hot climate. “ King Kodak '*
is going strong and well, and Miss Hill, who succeeded
Kate Vaughan, is a great acquisition. Another change,
too, is the supplanting of Joe Thompson’s son, who was a
dreadful stick, though he has a nice voice, much sweeter
than his papa's “ the field a pony.
Bard Robert Buchanan’s words, in his book “The
Coming Terror,’’ are applicable to the ptudes who
shudder at “The Second Mrs. Tanqneray.’’ Says he;
“I believe myself that playgoers would be a healthier
race if their morals were less tenderly taken care of;
that even morbid psychology is a healthier thing than
morbid prudery or Podsnappery. The courtesan is the
creature of society—pure and noble as in the case of
Aspasia; bold and vivacious as in the case of Nell
Gwynne ; sad and hectic as in the case of Marguerite
Gautier; or simply carnivorous as in the case of Nana
and Cora Pearl. As long as she exists, either as a woman
of that social safety-valve kind recognised in the execrable
ethics of Swedenborg, or as a sad * necessity’ created by the
evils of modern society, she will have her fit place in
literature as well as in life.”
Chevalier was once singing at Southampton and a lady,
hearing him for the first time, was overheard remarking:
“ He sings rather nicely ; but what a pity he has such a
fearful Cockney accent 1” Such is fame !
Charming Annie Hughes has got a divorce from her
husband, Mr. or “Captain," Devereux. Irving has given
her an engagement at the Lyceum, and having so good a
show will be some solace to her.
The manager’s daughter should never go to sleep in the
manager’s box when the new and original play is being
produced. It looks too much like a vote of censure on
the poor author.
The “Living Pictures,” at Sydney Lyceum, are not
only unobjectionable, but admirable ; yet to the average
spectator they are allective rather than artistic. High
art doesn’t sway the community like primal passion.
Through the hush which followed the unveiling of “The
Fairy of the Moon” the other evening came a harsh
whisper; “ I say, Bill, wot woodyer give to be there!”
That’s how the “ Living Pictures” strike the Man in the
Street.
Johnny Gourlay has filed his schedule—liabilities, £188;
assets, 10s. A three times better div. than Matthew
Davies’, anyhow.
One Bongers, of Parramatta, writes to Sydney Tele-
graph in defence of showman Talmage. “ Nobody can
be blind,” says Bongers, “to the fact that Dr. Talmage
is a man for the times. Perhaps if Dr. Talmage’s lectures
had been free, he would have been the best of men.
Some people have an idea e‘,tt|,rhauera ncesavets cmwfp

either a slab of Welsh or else the Linotype-machine has
gone mad.
When Snazelle was giving a scenoscopic show at Fiji,
he accepted a large quantity of curios as payment for
admission by the natives. Amongst the articles thus
added to the Snazellian treasury was a pair of whale’s
jaws weighing two tons. Since his return to England he
has presented these articles of vertu to G. R. Sims, and
“ Dagonet ” now has them in his museum of theatrical
curiosities labelled, “The most remarkable free pass in
the world.”
Bland Holt has leased Sydney Royal for three years
from next Boxing night, when he will commence a
dramatic season.
Hilda Spong will take another benefit shortly—at Melb.
Bijou in “As You Like it." Then she goes to London.
Although it has been kept a “dead” secret, A. E-
Greenaway was married some weeks prior to his de-
parture.
Madame Simonsen, long ago, used to make odd speeches
from the stage. Once, at her benefit, Melb. Princess’,
after a provincial tour, she said: “I have brought back
with me another little Australian.” Was this Prances
Saville or Jules?
The pickpocket knew that his first dive in the mob of
Presbyterian parsons, welcoming Talmage, at Spencer-st.
Railway Station, Melb., would result in something good.
So he got £ll, from Rev. Hardie. This is the shepherd
who was so shocked at play-acting. The actor doesn’t
carry £ll.
Signor Hazon was educated for the Bar of his native
town in Italy. The son of a barrister and brother of
another, he only entered the Milan Conservatoire at the
age of 20. Conductors are born, not made.
Darrell’s “Tank-array” drama at Melb. Royal is built
round the sensation scene in “The Lights of London,"
only wetter. After seeing the heroine’s sousing one
realises that it is a play in which Darrell gets all the fat
and Miss Leigh all the dripping.
The latest London sensation is Miss Arniotis, a strong
woman, alleged to be pretty and of magnificent physique.
She carries two men astride a barrel with one hand and
performs any tests the audience ask for. A gilded youth
recently put up the price of a grand piano with an extra
tenner if the lady would pick up the instrument and
throw it into the stalls. A space was cleared and tb» feat
was done without madamoiselle turning a hair,
Pall Mall Gazette says Carnot had a
fatal liver-complaint.
In the N.S. W. Supreme Court case,
M’Namara v. Bruce Smith (as Minister for
Works), barrister Bruce Smith appeared for the
plaintiff, M'Namara, and against himself as the
nominal defendant.
The Vienna butchers have nothing to learn
from their friends in Smithfield. Recently a ship-
ment of Queensland beef was sent to Vienna, and
was at once bought up by butchers and retailed
as veritable Austrian.
When sentence of death was passed on
William Brown, at Gladstone, S.A., lately, he
remarked, addressing the Chief Justice, “ I wish
I had shot your Honor.” He might have done
so, too, only that his Honor happened to get the
“ drop ” on him.
The Vic. Railway Department has sent a
notice round to all station-masters to the effect
that 90 trucks have gone a-missing. Any infor-
mation concerning them will be thankfully
received. This ought to give Speight a lift. He
never lost 90 trucks in one act, anyhow.
Missing Friends.

Editor Bulle-

that there is no

certainly no Asiatic
ever has the atrocious
fetor of the true
negro—a fetor which
cannot be disguised
by perfumes, or re-
moved by ablution,
and which is not
found in any other
race on earth. It is
as characteristic as
the odour of the
goat or the fox.
“ Colour ” as a mark
of race is all moon-
shine, and the idea
that a li gh ter or d arker
shade of brown in the
skin is, independently
of physiologicaldiffer-
ences, a proof of con-
genital inferiority is
simply the result of
ignorance. Even in
Africa the negro fetor
is not found among
the negroid Arabs of
the Soudan, the true

Dear Bulletin,— The necessity for parson
M'Neill’s globe-trotting is not made clear by the
statement that he “gave up the rich Regent
Square congregation” in London. Regent Square
itself is a haunt of fashionable immorality, where
the shepherd might have found enough “work”
to last him a lifetime. Or, if he wanted a change,
why didn’t he stick to crowded London instead of
wandering abroad and disguising himself in a
’Mnrkan accent?—Yours, &c., O’Neill.

purpose of wedding the kindly lady who has

of the machines on the comps, may be ganged
by the fact that at present 18 men do the entire
composition—formerly the work of about 70 men.
Two Sydney firms claim to have linotype agencies,
the one acting for the proprietors of the U.S.
patents, the other for the holders of the Canadian
rights. As the machine does not seem to have
been fully protected in Australia, there will
probably be some cutting in the prices between
the rival manufacturers.
Douglas Sladen, the great “Australian ”
skite :
I was so vexed with myself for not going and paying
my respects to Mr. W. D. Howells, when he was over
here. Of course my not seeing him must he put down to
my ignorance of his arrival in London, for I have the
highest admiration for Mr. Howells, both as an author
and as a man.
Howells has had a narrow escape. By the way,
the “Australian laureate,” in a two-column
chronicle of small beer he does anonymously for
Jerome’s Toady, quotes a sonnet by Mr. Douglas
Sladen in settlement now and for ever of the
dispute as to the real location of King Arthur’s
“Towered Caraelot.” Some men are born to

Says Bice, M.L.O. (S.A.) : “ A garrotter

being flogged ?” Bice might also ask, “Whoever
expects to hear of it?” The old Hinglish right of
every man to beat his own wife, identical with
the old Yankee right of every man to wallop his
own nigger, is so deep-rooted, that the very idea
of putting the wife-beater on the level of the
garrotter seems blasphemous, somehow.

The “dastardly attempt” to overthrow
the train near Campbelltown (Tas.) by placing
“huge stones” on the line (vide Tas. papers),
turns out to be an insignificant affair. The
“ monsters ” were children playing “grotto ” with
small pebbles. The Derwent Valley episode,
when the delinquent was surprised in the act of
removing the rails, and fired a shot through the
ganger’s hand, seems to be a more serious business,
and, like the Horseshoe Bend mystery, will be
hard to unravel.
Steward, M.H.R., has a Bill before Maori-
land Parliament for the abolition of the venerable
curse of Government by Contradiction. Steward
proposes that there shall be six paid and two
honorary Ministers—six elected by the Lower and
two by the Upper House. The Premier is to be
elected by the Cabinet, and shall occupy his posi-
tion for one year only. Ministers are to hold
office for the duration of Parliament, unless four
of them should resign, in which case their port-
folios all become vacant ; or unless any one or all
of them should be displaced by a vote of the
House. Only one no-confidence vote can be taken
concerning the same Minister in one session,
and it cannot be taken unless demanded by 20
members. The weakness of this scheme lies in
the fact that the Premier only holds office for
one year; Steward evidently assumes that every
Cabinet will contain three possible Premiers,
whereas the trouble in the ordinary Cabinet is
that it doesn’t contain even one. Otherwise, the
Bill has no noticeably weak points.

London Athenaeum says that Price
Warung’s “Tales of the Early Days,”
familiar to Bulletin readers, should never
have been written, but as the book has
been published the advice given is that it
should not be read. The chief objection
raised to the book by the Athenaeum is
that the writer has raked up the horrors
of Norfolk Island and Port Arthur. The
reviewer doesn’t question the facts adduced
by the writer, but simply, as the
European Mail remarks, seems averse
to having horrors recounted which
have really happened—under modern
English rule. The Bulletin presumes
that the new-chum whom Dibbs has
hoisted into the N.S.W. historiographer-
ship may be relied upon not to un-
duly shock the sensitive nerves of J.
Bull.

Dangers of Spring.
Some Valuable Suggestions fob both
Men and Women at Just This
Season op the Yeae.
“I ought to take some spring medicine ; I must
take something, I feel so miserable.”
Such a remark as this is often heard at this time
of the year. Nearly every one seems to feel the
need of some remedy, because the passing from
winter to spring, with its resulting changes in
clothing, food and exercise, has a very trying
effect on the system. After the severe strains of
winter, the health of most people is not so good as
it ought to be. The appearance of warm, spring
days finds them weak and debilitated, feeling the
need of tone and strength.
This is the reason why so many people are now
complaining of tired, irritable, languid feelings.
They wonder why it is they have these distressing
symptoms.
The best physicians say that this weak condition
is caused by the liver being out of order. There
is too much bile in the system. This brings on
dyspepsia and other miserable feelings which
make life a burden.
When the liver is irregular in its action the
complexion becomes pale and sallow, there is a
sense of oppression after eating, bloating and
biliousness. Backaches, sideaches and headaches
depress the spirits, making the sufferer feel dis-
couraged and despondent. It was to cure these
disorders of the system that Warner’s Safe Cure
was specially designed. In the most trying cases
this great remedy never once fails to give prompt
relief. It is popular everywhere, because it is
always reliable and effective. For the past fifteen
years Warner’s Safe Cure has been before the
public and achieved a success never equalled in
the history of medicine, not only in Australasia,
but also in all the countries in the world. The
greatest physicians have strongly recommended
Warner’s Safe Cure, because it is a purely vege-
table compound, containing no harmful drugs or
opiates, and because it does exactly as represented.
It permanently cures all kidney, liver, urinary and
nervous disorders. It builds up the system and
gives, new life.
When you are without appetite, are constipated,
have a coated tongue, a nasty taste in the mouth,
sick headache, pains under the shoulder blades or
in the region of the kidneys, your liver is out of
order. You feel nervous, despondent, lack your
accustomed energy. The Safe Cure will relieve
all these symptoms. It will make you strong and
well.
Now is the time to put the system in sound
condition. This is the season to lay in a stock of
health to carry you through the year. Nature
demands the use of a powerful and timely remedy.
The testimony of the thousands who owe their
health and strength to the great Safe Cure above
mentioned proves that it is the most effective
remedy, the most reliable and the best.

LASSITUDE,
TORPIDITY,
SOUR STOMACH,
INDIGESTION,
HEADACHE,
BACKACHE, etc.,
Take a couple of Fletcher’s Pills every second
night; they are a prompt and sure cure and give
certain relief.
FLETCHER’S PILLS are a quick, sure and
reliable remedy for all complaints arising from
torpid liver, indigestion, weak stomach, and
impurities of the blood. They are prepared on
rational and sensible lines and do not contain a
particle of calomel, gamboge, or any drastic
purgative, but operate by p rfectly naturalmeans,
by stimulating the liver and increasing the flow of
bile and thus producing easy evacuations and
natural catharses without the annoyance and pain
of griping and purging.
Beware of the many harmful substitutes on sale
in many shops. None are genuine unless they
bear the signature of F. Moore Clements on the
outside wrapper. CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have become such house-
hold words that imitations are frequently offered.
We contend that this imitation is the sincerest
proof of their virtues, so see that you always get
the genuine, bearing the name and address of

POLITICAL
POINTS
It is quite obvious that old man Parkes is
still pursuing Reid in the leading columns of a
“ great ” Svdney daily paper.
S A. public debt, including N. Territory,
is £23,101,815, annual interest £940,334, or
£2 18s. 9d. per head of population.
Restrict the growth of large estates and
the evils of land- monopoly are lessened though
nbt obliterated. Let the Dead provide for the
paper quotes Cardinal Moran as
saving that Australia will yet grant State aid to
RO. schools. Australia will see the Cardinal m
heaven first! .
S A National Ass party are buying up the
provincial press. Two hitherto democratic
weeklies recently changed hands, and both now
yell for the Ass.
The real trouble with Victoria is ignored
bv the corruot Parliament that brought it upon
the country.* The chickens of judicial scandal
have come home to roost.
The two Melbourne “dailies” agree on
one important political point. They both favour
a reduction in the number of Legislative Assem-
blers from 95 to 50 or 60.
G H. Reid is the fifth barrister who has
held’office as N.S.W. Treasurer. His prede-
cessors were Marshall Burdekm, W. A. Long,
B. Cohen, and Bruce Smith.
At the general election of 1891 the lawyers’
barracks, Wentworth Court, Sydney, held nearly
100 votes. At the recent general election it had
just ONE on the roll, that of the resident care-
An income-tax falls upon Fat Man and his
extravagant friends. A property-tax falls upon
poor men as well as Fat Man, but leaves toe
majority of his friends and supporters untouched.
S. A. railways earned in 1893-4, £999,600.
Working expenses were £569,800. Profits paid
over 3| per cent, on railway debt of £12,j40,000.
There is only one private line in S. A.
Out of the 129 persons elected to the
council of the Melbourne branch of the Australa-
sian Federation League only eight were ladies.
Surely a small proportion of Angel to Brute in
these woman-glorifying times !
Now, failing barrister Shiels and barriste r
Deakin, Victoria’s only hope is in attorney Turner-
He, like Deakin, is a star of the Australian
Natives’ Association, a powerful help, i timer is
a youngish, ineffectual-looking man, but it must
be said that he has hitherto risen to the occasion,
with the comparatively slight calls made on him.
It may be doubted whether he has the physique
for the strain of leadership.
There are 16 lawyers in N.S.W.
Legislative Assembly.
Editor Bulletin, —H. M. Win-
throp repeats the everlasting wail about
that bugbear, the “appreciation of
gold.” He says—“ Every nation worth
considering, England always excepted,
is anxious that something should be
done to rehabilitate silver, ’’ &c.. Why
in the world don’t they do the “some-
thing”? The truth is, neither they
nor the rest of the world have the
remotest idea what that something
should be. They cannot, if they try,
establish a stable equilibrium between
the values of gold and silver. They
cannot order the owners of silver-mines
to close them. As for the fall in prices,
that is no more due to the fluctuations
of the silver-market than to the spots
on the sun. Production is advancing
faster than consumption. ’Tis increas-
ing not only in quantity, but in area.
Improved means of communication are
daily bringing the produce of large dis-
tricts, formerly shut out, to in
the markets of Europe. The Argentine
which, a few years ago, exported
nothing but hides and a little wool, now
sends to Europe quantities of preserved
and frozen meat. India, by the exten-
sion of railways, is daily increasing its
output of cotton, and has almost a
monopoly of the jute manufacture. This
intense competition is lowering prices,
and will continue to bring them down
till the limit of profitable production is
reached in the cheapest countries of
the world. Muddling with the cur-
rency will not affect that competition.
The Victorian “ Royal ” Agricultural
Society has unanimously resolved :
That, as the principle of One-man-one-vote had been
unnecessarily tacked on the Federation scheme,. this
society withdraws from the movement entirely.
Arthur Rae, defeated by 7 votes at Mur-
rumbidgee (N.S.W.) election, has petitioned the
elections committee to disqualify T. Fitzpatrick,
the successful candidate, on the ground of various
informalities, which leave A. Rae of hope.
; N.S.W. Premier Reid is said to have
sacrificed <£soo a year in giving Brunker the
Colonial Secretaryship, that being the difference
between the salary of that office and the Treasurer-
ship, But then Brunker insisted and Reid could
not get on without him.
Tkmuka (M.L.) Leader: “No woman
-except some old virago would ever think of con-
testing an election with a view of becoming a
M.P.” Query ; would any woman, except some
old virago, ever think of becoming a monarch,
which is an even more public position than that
of an M.P. ?
Sydney D.T. condemns the application of
an aged and unrepealed law to the Glebe Adven-
tist who worked at bricklaying one recent
Sunday ; but when a similar aged and unrepealed
law was set in motion against the “strike con-
spirators ” of a few years ago, it argued that,
while the law was on the Statute book, it was the
duty of Government to enforce it to the letter.
It also argued that the only “ constitutional”
w ay of annulling that law was to repeal it by a
vote in Parliament.
Parkes calls all the members of the Reid
Ministry who previously held office under himself
“ traitors,” and intimates that, politically, they
don’t merit to be touched with a tongs. It would,
therefore, be interesting to have the old man in the
Premiership once more, merely to find what sort
of a team he would rake up.
The latest insult to the Far North. The
estimates of the Southern Government provide
for only two Northern public works in the coming
financial year. A gaol at Norman ton and a recep-
tion-room at Hughenden. Here you have a
succinct and eloquent summary of Northern
wants as estimated by the South.
Thus Bishop Selwyn at the Colonial Insti-
tute, on South Sea affairs : —“ Where Christianity
obtains in our islands population tends to increase,
infanticide and internecine wars are checked, and
villages begin to grow.” And the population (in
both Christian and pagan islands) is only one-
fourth of what it was 20 years ago.
Q. Government is supporting a Bill for
establishing Inebriates’ Institutions at the expense
of the State, while at the same time permitting
bad liquor to manufacture drunkards wholesale.
Thus it soothes the Christian Temperance interest
without offending the Licensed Victuallers, and
at the same time provides more fat billets for its
friends.
The democratic leaven now in M.L. Coun-
cil will probably enable the passage of the barrier-
removing Law Practitioners’ Bill which has been
engineered through the Lower House. Years
ago, Hori Grey carried a similar measure through
the Representatives ; but it was strangled in the
Council —largely though the influence of barrister
Whitaker, then leader of the Bar.
“ There is no place in all the world, I
believe, where any prosperity exists. The de-
pression is universal.” —Letter from a Maoriland
globe-trotter. A melancholy warning to those
philanthropists who always want the poor man to
move on somewhere or anywhere in search of that
Paradise which he never finds, and which no
amount of moving on will ever bring to light.
Sliiels, having discovered that he was an
impossible “new Vic. premier,” crawled into the
Patterson camp with a secret proposal to form a
temporary Coalition Government from among “the
best men in the House.” Patterson and Shiels
were to be the two very best men, whilst the six
or eight men nearest to them in political genius
and virtue would form the residue of the Ministry.
Patterson is supposed to have Gov. Hope-
toun’s word that he will sanction a dissolution in
the event of a Government defeat. The meat-
man’s appeal to the country would probably carry
as much weight as anybody else’s appeal. _ He
would promise all that the other side promised,
and more, and be quite as likely to make an effort
to accomplish something in a wild, blundering
way.
By this sign shall ye know them : If th®
new N.S.W. Ministry appoints to the Uppe r
Chamber those members who have lost their seats
through opposition to the iniquitous Australian
Rights Purchase Bill, its liberal professions may
be tinged with sincerity ; if not, the Reid admin-
istration must be closely watched, and promptly
strangled should it commit one overt act indi-
cating sympathy with the grabsters who are ever
on the alert to pick the eyes out of the public
estate.

on the finances which is to square up all, but
Robespierre, Mirabeau, and others, good or bad,

physic. The nation is sick. Auctioneers and
wine - merchants cannot treat the complaint,

W. J. Ferguson, M.L.A., when addressing
the Sturt (N.S.W.) electors during the recent
campaign :
I have the honour of appearing before you to-nighc as
the ideal candidate. lam the only ideal candidate before
tlie electors of N.S.W. I venture to say I will be able to
please the whole of the electors of this town and district.
I am an Anarchist, a Socialist, a Fenian, a Communist, an
Individualist, an Opportunist, and any other “Ist” I
may have forgotten. lam an Agnostic, an Atheist and
a good Presbyterian. lam a teetotaller, a moderate
drinker, and a heavy drunkard : and if there is any other
phase of the drink question lam that also. I continually
stir up strife, cause hatred and jealous} 7 , and am a lover
of peace. lam a Protectionist, a Freetrader, a Single-
taxer and an independent candidate. I swear, use vulgar
language, and squirt tobacco-juice. I have brazen
effrontery, am conceited, and naturally of a modest and
retiring disposition. lam a monstrous liar, misrepresent
people, and always speak the truth. 1 am a Radical, a
Liberal and a Conservative. lam a man of gigantic in-
tellect, of mediocre talents and an imbecile. lam a
burglar, a spieler, and am generally admired by decent
people. lam the greatest villain on earth, the devil in-
carnate, and I always look happy. In fact, if there is any
other qualification that I have forgotten which is neces-
sary to make a good statesman, let me know, and I can
easily transform myself. So you will see that it is not
necessary for press writers to call me any other names, for
I acknowledge I am anything and everything.
A return of all appointments made to
N.S. Wales Civil Service by the Dibbs Ministry
would be most instructive. Dibbs and his col-
leagues were full of that most noble of all human
impulses—gratitude; but it was gratitude at the
expense of the consolidated revenue. If they
could not find a billet open they made one. If they
couldn’t make a man inspector of scaffolds they
made him inspector of water-bores. If the water-
bores, present and prospective, were all being
inspected, then they appointed their benefactor
inspector of gas.
At the recent N.S.W. elections 44,000
voters were apparently disfranchised through
change of residence —a much larger proportion
than previously estimated. With this exception
the new Act worked wonderfully well; and an
amendment providing that a voter not qualified
by residence to vote in one electorate may vote for
another in which he has previously resided would

effectively wipe out its chief blot. Nearly 81 per
cent, of qualified voters recorded their votes—a
very satisfactory proof of the vitality of the
system of Government.
The Queensland Civil Service 4 per cent,
reduction (superannuation fund) is doomed. It
was adopted some five years ago amid universal
execration. Its own parents were ashamed of it,
and lacked the courage to defend their bantling in
the House. Its peculiar advantages consisted in
there being no provision for the wife and children
of a deceased civil servant; no surrender value
and no pension till you reached the mature age of
sixty. It was professedly a plagiarism of that
hopelessly insolvent device, the N.S.W. police
superannuation scheme. The Boodlewraith is
casting it overboard as a sop for the civil service
vote.
A recent farmers’ conference at Young
(N.S.W.) passed a resolution in favour of a land-
tax with exemption up to 1280 acres in the
Eastern, 2500 in the Central, and 5000 in the
Western district. The fact that a body of farmers
—mainly landholders themselves—should approve
of a land-tax, has greatly encouraged the Single-
tax party. The dismal circumstance is that every
farmer present came in under the exemption
clause. They all wanted simply to tax the other
man. In this respect they are like all the other
Single-taxers of The Bulletin’s acquaintance, 95
per cent, of whom have no land at all, while the
rest come in under the exemption clause. The
yearning to tax the other fellow seems absolutely
incurable.

payers who wished to protest against Treasurer
Carter’s since slaughtered drag net proposals.
Same old end to
Same old story—
Start a Radical,
End a Tory.
Melbourne people are debating whether
Premier Patterson is least bearable in his serious
moments or in his spasms of humour. When he is
trying to be funny he cackles at the reporters like
a hysterical jackass, and he is always funniest
when he is hurt worst. When Shiels has flayed
him and rubbed the salt in, J.B. always affects to
regard the matter as a splendid joke, after he
has had time to soften the seams that form along
his iron jaws and corrugate his brow, but his £rin
is about as mirthful as that which adorns a dead
sucking-pig with a lemon in its mouthy Patter-
son, for all the apparent thickness of his hide, takes
a roasting worse than any other man in the House;
you can fairly see the grease bubbling out of him
as he squirms on the spit.
Governments retrench with modifications.
A S.A. legislator has a son in the post-office,
and the youth was entitled last financial
year to an increase of .£5, but the Ministerial
policy of economy prevented it being paid.
Thereupon the father began to bring influence to
bear, and a threatening letter went in to the head
of the department. Fearful of losing a vote, a
promise was made to pay the money, but then
representations were made on behalf of other
clerks in the same office who had equal claims to
consideration. Placed on the horns of a dilemma,
the advances were given all round, so that the
original .£5 cost the State £l4O, the payments
being made retrospectively for the financial
year beginning on July 1, 1893. In no other
Government department were any increases made.
And it wasn’t a Labour member, either.
Cabled that four of the little Centra
American Republics have gone into partnership,
after fighting like Kilkenny cats. The assured
future is that Brazil and Chili will head a con"
federation of all South America, just as all North
America will become one. This was the ideal of
the noble Blaine.
The Age, August 16, jumping on the
collapsed Patterson :
In the Law department the administration was of a
character so partial and unfair as to cause the Solicitor-
General to leave his colleagues rather th n share the
odium of an act designed to balk the administration of
justice.
This is David up to date. Those who remember
the careful attitude of the Age in mildly cen-
suring Isaacs, and carefully condoning the boom
companions in the Ministry, will snigger at the
long-delayed outbreak of virtue. It is easy to be
virtuous after the act.
In some N.S.W.
State - schools the
teachers frequently use
S.M. Herald leaders
for purposes of dicta-
tion, instead of em-
ploying the ordinary
text-books. This prac-
tice should be vigor-
ously suppressed. If a
S.M. Herald leader
doesn’t come under the
heading of cruelty to
children, it (Might to.
Further, no teacher has
a right to use the public
schools for spreading
one particular brand of
politics any more than
for spreading one par-
ticular brand of reli-
gion ; and apart from
this, the man who
teaches the S. M.
Herald’s stilted and
feebly indefinite stylo
of expression is a { üblic
enemy. The Herald
uses language, not that
it may express its
thoughts, but that it
may totter feebly
around them in a s< rh s
of circles and never gi t
any further.

perience forces me to

The Upper King River (Vic.) Freetradc
Democratic Association “protestsstrongly again I
the increased excise-duty on tobacco grown in
Victoria, as it is likely to kill the industry, whic h
is now becoming very ini] ortant.” Carter's
excise-duty was intended to put the locally-grown
and the imported tobacco on the same level—in
other words, to put them on an absolute Free
trade basis and the above-named association
objects. Evidently some of the “Democratic Fie -
trade” leagues which Max Hirsch formed n
Victoria have been constructed on a purely
humorous basis.
“ I believe that not only in this country,
but in all English-speaking c untries, the duty ol
a politician is tolerably plain. To my mind it
seems that to counteract and check by every
means the power of wealth, to expose its preten-
sions, to strip it by force of all special political
power which it now claims and possesses, to
endeavour by all legitimate means to break up into
fragments its ever-accumulating masses, and to
cast upon it that which it has never yet borne in
this country—its due share of public burdens, and
by due share I mean all but a nominal share of
public burdens—is the plain duty of those poli-
ticians who desire the adoption of measures to
prevent the deadly effect of the injurious in-
fluence of wealth upon the destinies of mankind.”

Pressure is being brought to bear on N.S.
Wales Premier Reid in connection with his pro-
posed reforms in the Civil Service with a view to
inducing him to prevent a man and his wife from
concurrently holding salaried posts under Govern-
ment. This is a topic bound to grow big in the
near future, and Mr. Reid will want to walk
warily if he is to avoid having to walk backwards.
Why should not the future give us a female
Premier with her husband in the post of Parlia-
mentary doorkeeper, or gaol governor with her
husband in the position of badiff ? If, because a
man works, his wife shall not work, then when a
woman works her husband should not work ; and
if under Government this be so, then why should
it be otherwise anywhere else?
« * •
The Dutton divorce-suit (Melb.) is—or
was, perhaps, by this time—a long, expensive
attempt by a pretty woman to get quit of a good-
looking young husband who likes beer. As
regards the extent of his partiality for beer there
is a wild conflict of testimony, a remark which
also applies to his alleged liking for Nellie (a
maid servant). On the face of Nellie, most
reasonable people would assume that Dr. Dutton
did not adore her in preference to beer, anyway,
and certain medical evidence supports this view
of the Nellie case. From sundry weak charges of
cruelty to his wife the doctor cleared himself
without much trouble. He never raised his hand
against the lady, although he had to sew his
own buttons on, and find his own refreshment
when he came home later than 10 p.m. He must
have admired her once, and he can scarcely have
changed his opinion that Mrs. Dutton, after ten
years of matrimony, looks quite nice enough to
eat. She is more tempting than the average kind
of cold supper that a husband filches from a dark
larder after the household has retired to rest.
All things considered, the Dutton comedy is a
matter in which a temperance lecturer might very
well intervene by calling upon respondent to
“swear off it.” Suppose Dutton signs the pledge
of inviolate sobriety, and then proceeds to discuss
the absurd Nellie question calmly and quietly
with the fascinating petitioner. The Bulletin
offers the suggestion in all seriousness. Let the
doctor explain to his wife that a private fortune
of £15,000 is easily consumed in the fiery furnace
of the law, and let him smile as he was wont to
smile in the dear old days, when love was bathed
in moonlight and the world held only two peopl e
and a lot of others who didn’t go for anything at
all. Mrs. Dutton will probably rescue the large
residue of her legacy from the furnace aforesaid,
and fall sobbing upon the converted doctor’s
shoulder, and there will be more joy in Heaven
over two brands plucked from the burning than
over 99 respectable Nellies who need no repent-
ance.
Mrs. Dutton complained, in Melb. Divorce
Court, that her husband forced her to pull off his
boots. She ought to be proud to share the fate
of Louis XTV’s cousin, the Duchess of Mont-
pensier, who, after numerous abortive attempts to
conclude a satisfactory marriage, was forced to
put up with a dissipated roue named Lauzun,
with whom she fell over head and ears in love.
Madame, in her memoirs, gives many touching
stories of the endearing ways of her hubby—among
the rest, that he came home one day from hunting,
a little the worse for liquor, and covered with
mud, threw himself on a couch in her boudoir,
and shouted : “ Louise de Bourbon, pull off my
boots !” She did it, too.
# # #
A Bulletin man enquiring his way to the
Dutton divorce-case, at Melb, Law Courts, was
told that it was “just opposite to Speight and
Syme,”
• # #
Cabled that—“ Committees of inquiry in
London and St. Petersburg have confirmed certain
grave charges which had been made against Kate
Marsden, a Siberian missionary.” This is the
advertising lady who wore trousers and straddled
horses in Siberia. Miss Marsden formerly lived
in Maoriland, where her pretensions as a philan-
thropist seem to have been so accurately sized up
that a broad grin pervaded the Land of the Moa
on receipt of the cablegrams which told how nicely
she was getting on among the Royal family.

In Quevedo’s imaginary “ Sophopolis ” no
citizen could propose corporal punishment unless
he could prove that he had sampled his pet penalty
in his own person. An hour or two of the tube-
gag would probably convince Mr. N.S.W. Prison-
Comptroller Miller that the torture he proposes to
re-introduce belongs as much to a brutal past as
he apparently does himself. Mr. Miller, by the
way, has only for four or five years occupied his
present position, for which he is in no small degree
indebted to thelate Mr. Dailey. For over 20 years
he was an officer of the Education department,
and until appointed Comptroller over the heads
of many long-tried penal officials, he had probably

Observer : “ Witnessing jockey Corrigan’s
funeral defile along S'wanston-street, I thought to
myself—What an answer this is to the aspersions
on the racing world. Look at those noble coun-
tenances ! Just average the men who are riding
in the buggies. Do you see any signs there of
drink, debauchery, cruelty, spidery ? No! This
is the kind of thing for the State to encourage.
Let racing flourish ! It draws out all the splendid

Dear Bulletin, — The most striking
features of Melbourne street traffic just now are
(1) vans containing time-payment furniture seized
for arrears of hire. (2) Hearses conveying corpses
to the cemetery, (3). Swagmen on their way out
“to the land.” By the way, I saw one of the
latter the other day riding on a bicycle with his
swag strapped in front of him. He was also
smoking a cigar. Talk about glory after this !

Old Robert Hoddle,
the surveyor of early Mel-
bourne, whose will is being
contested 13 years after 1 is
decease, seems to have had
a ghostly discussion with
his first wife before she
passed hence. Once she
asked him whether; he
would be frightened if her
spirit returned to visit him
on earth, and he said she
would never be allowed to
come back. He added,
being always a great be-
liever in house property—
“ In my Father’s house are
many mansions,” because
—as the old gent, ex-
plained in a letter to his
grandson—he didn’t think
it likely that himself and
Mrs. H. would “ inhabit
the same quarters ” aloft.
Also, as showing that he
wasn’t troubled by
thoughts of her spirit put-
ting in an appearance, the
septuagenarian Hod die
married a blushing young
maiden within ninemonths
of becoming a widower.
He lived no to enjoy 17
years of second marriage,
and then left a widow in
possession of nearly all his
money, and a mutual little
daughter, the plaintiff in
these tardy proceedings.
This daughter, by the way,
has married a solicitor.
Given a solicitor on the
one hand, and a fat estate
on the other, and proceed-
ings are tolerably certain

The undoubted Joke of Talmage’s first
appearance at Melb. Town Hall was the brother
divine who introduced him to the audience. This
uncalled for apparition wore black silk stockings,
and buckled shoes, and lace ruffles. An aggres-
sive-looking man, with a moustache and two stiff
bunches of whisker adjoining. It transpired that
he was the Moderator of the local Presbytery,
who had known Talmage in America. After he
had obliged the audience by ceasing to make
introductory remarks the Moderator dropped into
his chair and put in a most uncomfortable evening.
Whilst the Yankee showman bellowed and rasped
his gospel of “cheerfulness" the unhappy chair-
man writhed and twisted like the worm that never
dioth. When the long, lank earthquake announced
himself in favour of a gruesomely lively Sabbath
the Moderator’s countenance turned as green as
the grass and as blue as the glo-o-rious sky. Ho
might have been Bloody Mary discovering that
she had just given sixpence to a heretic. At the
conclusion of the lecture, which finished on an
enormous top-note, as in Sydney, the Moderator
glared helplessly and tried to think of something
to mention. He couldn’t collect his agonised
thoughts in time, so his black legs carried him
silently away.

The Admiralty order to British naval

the women would hunt up the constables in their
barracks, similarly discountenanced by the
inspectors. “ When our police are off duty take

A pathetic-looking little woman, who filed
her schedule recently down South, explained that
she had gone broke through making reckless mar-
riage settlements. When she wedded her first hus-
bandshesettledhalf herfortuneon their prospective
family. When she married her second husband
she spent £lOOO in paying his debts, and settled
,£BOOO on him and ,£lOOO on his mother, so that
he cost her £lO,OOO in all. Most of the money was
borrowed at 8 per cent. Then the husband left
her, and the mortgage ate her up and reduced her to
bankruptcy. She acknowledged that her action
was foolish, but she couldn’t get him on any other
terms, and—with a wistful look in her brown
eyes—she “ didn’t want to lose him.” The only
gleam of humour in the story concerned a certain
bank manager who lent the £BOOO for the marriage-
settlement at 8 per cent., with a cast-iron proviso
that the husband was to deposit the money in his
bank at 6 per cent. Then the bank broke once or
twice, and in a financial sense the missing husband
dunno where ’e are.

At a recent Jewish wedding, ab Melb.
Masonic Hall, there ensued, after the ceremony, a
scene of indiscriminate and most emphatic public
kissing. The lovely bride kissed every member of
the big circle around her—presumably her friends
and relations —both male and female alike. The
bridegroom confined his kissing to the womenkind
of the gathering ; but as both sets of kissing went
on simultaneously it just sounded like a rapid
succession of pistol reports ! Perhaps they did it
to relievo their feelings, or to avert bad omens,
three of which, according to a wiseacre present,
had come about. When the canopy for bride and
bridegroom to stand under, was being put up, one
of the four supports got broken; then the ring
was dropped, and there was a scramble to find it;
and next the bridegroom had to try three times
before he could smash the wine-glass out of which
he and his bride had drunk. The kissing was
possibly a set off.

It was said in a
publicans’ journal
the other day that
the only effective
way of preventing
s piri t-adulteration
is to reduce the
Customs duty to 9s.
per gallon. No
doubt high duty in-
cites to adultera-
tion, but even were
the duty reduced to
ss. a gallon there
are ghouls who
would still mix and
vend poisons. The
only way to j revent
adulteration is to
make it a crime
punishableby heavy
fine and inq rison-
ment, and to insist
on police and magis-
trates doing their
duty. Adultera-
ti< n of fro 1 or drink
should be as punish-
able as the issue of
spurious coin.
Ab Toowoomba (Q.) Circuib Courb lately,
Judge Harding sternly reproved a local solicitor,
who wore a light suit, for “appearing before the
court in a suit of clothes which he would have
worn at a race-meeting.” It is about time that
someone informed the Australian judge that the
law gives him no jurisdiction in the matter cf a
solicitor’s clothes, so long as the solicitor has
clothes of some kind, and that the devil’s advo-
cate has a right to turn up in knickerbockers if he
feels so inclined. The worst of it is that the
Bench’s yearning after inky garments can hardly
avoid giving an unconscious bias to its decisions.
When the law is evenly balanced between two
litigants, the party whose solicitor wears a long,
sombre tail-coat generally has the best chance,
though the judge himself is entirely unaware of
the fact.

The Voice, the new Sydney woman-paper,
promises that the coming woman will be “fearless

from her hand-bag and adjusts them in her
mouth. And the woman who is fearless with
effrontery is of the type that sneezes in her plate
and says, “Damn it!” But there is very little
for man to choose between them.

The Maoriland Rational Dress Association,
in a manifesto on the advantages of knicker-

to hint as delicately as possible that, for certain
obvious reasons, knickerbockers are not for the
mothers of our race. The circumstances of the
case can’t be fully explained, but anyone who
thinks the matter over carefully will probably
conclude that the daughters of our race would
look a lot better in the togs abovementioned.

How to Get a Piano or Organ.
YOU of course, want the highest quality of tone, action,
touch and beauty of exterior you can afford; but
you MUST HAVE durability. Durability is an indispensable
condition, and however cheap an instrument may appear,
without durability it is worthless. Avoid the cheap
pianos, for which there are agents in every town, who tell
—and often through ignorance believe—that they are
equal to the Steinway or the Erard or some other first-
class maker. Therefore, no matter how big a bargain you
think somebody else offers, investigate

Probably one reason why the travelling
evangelist leaves so few permanent traces behind
him is that it is almost exclusively the good people
who go to hear him and be converted, ihe bad
people consistently stay away, but the same old
crowd of church-members roll up at the services of
each successive revivalist, and are moved to tears,
and go away suffering from a temporary attack of
bilious repentance. Now and then lie gets a really
permanent convert, but it is generally some gentle,
kindly, white-haired old maid who never did a
really bad action in all her life, and who is lashed
into such a frenzy of pious abasement that she
never, in all her remaining life, quite gets over the
feeling that she is utterly lost. The really hard
case always dodges the evangelist somehow; if
150 mad expounders preached fury and brimstone
throughout the land for 12 months, the police
records would show no definite improvemen .

The two people who doubtless consider
themselves the most ill-used on earth reside in

him arrested for bigamy after having harassed
him almost to death. Under this charge he
proved that he was married in Yorkshire (Eng.\

“Not guilty,” the lady still pursues her victim,
“sticks him up” in the street, ghosts him to Ins
house, and, to make Ins life still more unsnppoit-
ahle, distributes printed circulars denouncing tun.

Everyone is surprised to see how well
ex-Premier Dibbs bears his sudden reverse of
fortune. But yesterday he might have stood
against the world, and to-day he does stand
against it. There is not a feather ruffled in his
knightly coat; not the reflection of the shadow of
the likeness of the sign of the ghost of a droop to
be seen in his ex-Republican crest. Though a
shattered political world has fallen in fragments
around him, the ruins strike him fearless—as
Horace beautifully puts it. Would it be treason
to hint that what gives strength to his mind, elas-
ticity to his step, and colour to his complexion, is
M—rsh—ll’sT n—c N—rv-ne ?


THE Wild-Cat Column,
“ A Policy-holder in the Citizens’ Life Assur-
ance Oo.’’ writes as follows;—‘‘l cannot help thinking
that the recent paragraph in the ‘ Wild-Oat Column ’
of The Bulletin re the Citizens' Life Assurance _ Co.
can scarcely be considered as altogether fair. The writer,
in a sneering way, remarks that the accumulated funds of
the Co. amount to only a little over one year’s income.
Well, at the close of '93 the amount was £187,203, and in
justice it should be said that the business which yielded
this substantial sum was not in existence eight years ago.
In all the provinces but N.S. Wales, a Life office com-
mencing business has to deposit with the Registrar of
Companies, in securities for the payment of assurances,
£5OOO, and in some instances, £lO,OOO, and to continue
to make deposits in accordance with the business secured
every year. The Citizens’ Co. has done this, and after
paying the initial cost of establishing itself throughout
Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand; also, during the
past year, paying an average of eleven death-claims per
day. Ido not think that a sneer is deserved if its savings
amount to the sum stated above.
“The Prudential Assurance Co., of London—an exactly
similar institution to the Citizens’—has now more than
10J millions of policies in force in its books, and its in-
vested funds amount to 18 millions. The Commercial
World, a long-established financial journal, reviews the
balance-sheet of the Prudential, also the returns to the
Board of Trade of that and over 70 other life offices, every
year. It may be credited, therefore, with a knowledge
of life assurance, and particularly industrial life assur-
ance. I find in the course of a leading article in its issue
of April 15,’93, with reference to the Citizens’ Co., the
following;—‘The Citizens’ Life of Australia has, in the
space of half-a-dozen years, attained a financial position
which British offices, doing similar business’ (and the
Prudential is one of them), ‘ only reached as the result of
arduous labour extending ever treble—and even more
than that—number of years.’ Now, if the Co. has done
as well as the Prudential during its first seven years of
existence, I think all who are interested in its stability
and progress will feel perfectly satisfied. And when The
Bulletin writes about the ‘ heavy expense loading ’ on
the pure premium—which it will not deny is necessary—
in * working-man’s assurance ’ —it will, I hope, in fairness
state that the Citizens’ has, also, an ordinary branch in
which policies are issued for quarterly, half-yearly and
yearly premiums, as is the case in other societies, and that
its expense is limited to 15 per cent. But, with regard to
the ‘ working-man,’ when he pays fid. a week for a £6O
policy in the Citizens’ it does not trouble him (any more
than if he bought a copy of The Bulletin) how much goes
to the vendor so long as he gets value for his money.
Those who are interested in the Citizens’ Co. have no
reason to think that its management will not continue to
give the best value possible for the patronage it receives ;
and, as the management is under the control of men of
well known shrewdness, success, and integrity in business,
it is scarcely necessary to say that it is fully alive to its
responsibilities with regard to the investment and accu-
mulation of the company’s funds. But, as proof of this,
I may mention that at the last annual meeting it was
announced that in future the industrial, as well as the
ordinary branch, would be subjected to an actuarial
valuation every year.”
The above is a first-class free “ad.,” which
elaborately avoids the points really at issue. The Citizens’
Co. has a premium income of £146,000, and its accumu-
lated assurance fund is £167,000, therefore it has, in seven
years, saved less than 14 months’ income. Even this
very interior result—the poorest shown by any Australian
insurance co.—was only arrived at by adding £24,000 to
the book-value of the company’s freehold property ; but
for that it would have less than a year's income in hand.
The Citizens’ has done no more than any other 00. in the
way of making deposits with the Registrars of Companies ;
these deposits only mean that it has invested a certain
proportion of its funds in Government debentures, and
draws the interest on them regularly, said deposits being
included among its assets in the ordinary way. There is
nothing extraordinary about “paying eleven claims a
day ’’—average £8 each; all insurance companies have
to pay claims. The number, by the way, isn’t eleven, but
rather less than ten. The fact that the claims are
large in proportion to the funds on hand only
shows that the funds are very small compared with
the liabilities. As regards the Prudential, it has no
more bearing on the Citizens’ case than it has on Cleo-
patra’s Needle; and whether the Prudential has ten million
policies in force, or half-a-dozen, or a billion doesn’t
signify in the least; it is the amount, not the number
of policies, that has to be considered. The Citizens’ saves,
almost every year, a smaller proportion of its income—in
other words, it makes a smaller provision for its con-
stantly increasing liabilities. Its expenses grow larger
almost every year, whereas those of other offices mostly
grow smaller, or attempt to do so. And, according to its
own acknowledgment, policies of less than three years’
standing—and, judging from the premium receipts, an
outsider would imagine that niost of its policies must be
of less than three years’ standing—“ have been treated as
having no liability.” Also the statement that the co. is
“fully alive to its responsibilities” isn’t evidence; in
fact, it isn’t even definite assertion. Many a man is alive
to his responsibilities, but makes a very bad mess of them
all the same. As for the actuarial valuation, which is to
take place in future every year— The Bulletin respect-
fully submits that if it took place every day it wouldn’t
necessarily make the expenses any smaller, or the annual
saving any larger, or make things better in any way.
Still an actuarial valuation—even one in which policies of
less than three years’ standing are treated as having no
liability—can hardly come too often.

Here is a point to be considered carefully by
shareholders in the Citizens’ Life Assurance Co. That
concern will issue an industrial policy for £lOO (without
profits) on the life of a man aged 30, for a weekly premium
of Is. 2d., equal to £3 os. Bd. per annum. Of this
amount, according to last balance-sheet, over £ll7s. 2d.
goes in expenses and dividend to shareholders, leaving
about £1 3s. 6d. net to pay for £lOO of insurance. The
A .M. P. Society effects a similar insurance for £ll7s. 9d. per
annum, of which ss. 4d. goes in expenses (there is no
dividend to shareholders), leaving £ll2s. sd. to pay for
£lOO of insurance. Now, when the A.M.P., the biggest
and most prosperous Australian office, can only afford
to do the above insurance for £ll2s. sd. per annum net
[the actual risk, according to the H.M. table of the Insti-
tute of Actuaries, is £1 13s. 4d.), how can the Citizens’,
which is neither the biggest nor the most prosperous
Australian office, do the same insurance for Bs. lid. less—
and keep on a sound basis 7 There is room for a whole lot
of hard thinking in this discrepancy.
« « * *
The Westralian proposal, now announced as
officially approved, lor a third Australian mint, will prob-
ably revive the question of a mint for Maorilahd ; and it
is even likely that Bananaland will put in claims for coin-
ing privileges. These possibilities suggest the objection
that so many independent establishments would entail on
Australasia as a whole an extravagant and unnecessary
expenditure. It is, therefore, a matter for serious con-
sideration whether Australia could not adopt the system
used in the United States, of having tributary establish-
ments at the necessary centres of gold production, which
would not actually be mints, but which would answer the
purpose as far as the miner would be concerned.
The United States has four mints—Philadelphia,
San Francisco, New Orleans, and Carson ; and six assay
o ffl ceg _New York, Denver, Helena, Boise, Charlotte, and
St. Louis. The function of the assay-bffices is to receive
the deposits of gold and the purchases of silver, to value
the metal in its various parcels and settle with the deposi-
tors and owners, and to ship the accumulations from time
to time to one of the other mints according to regulation,
for coinage. It would be quite feasible to adapt this
scheme to Australian needs; “assay-offices” could be
established as branches of the existing mints, and if Wes-
tralia, Maoriland, or any other mint-less province seri-
ously wishes to erase the charges at present operating
against the miner, the plan now proposed is at once
simple and economical.
The objection to the miners’ position in West-
ralia as regards the MinD is that he has to wait so long
before he knows the value of his parcel of gold. The
bank takes his deposit, holds it for the weekly steamer,
and ships if to its Melbourne office. The Melbourne
office lodges it at the Mint, waits the necessary
week for the returns, and posts the returns by
the next mail to Westralia. Five weeks are easily
absorbed in this fashion, and, meanwhile, the miner has
got an advance, at a price, from the bank. If he sells
right out the bank takes the cost of all this delay out of
him. These considerations have weighed with Premier
Forrest in inducing him to apply for a Mint, but it seems
clear that the assay othoe proposal would be much less
expensive.
The capital cost of a fully-equipped Mint, as
Thb Bulletin has pointed out, would be about £55,000,
and the subsequent expenses would be greater than any
probable revenue. On the other hand, the capital cost of
an assay office would be only £20,000, and the gross ex-
penses would probably be £6OOO, instead of £15,000, per
annum. There are considerations on the other side of the
question, but since the present coining plants at Sydney
and Melbourne are at present capable of coping with
twice the present gold-yield of Australasia, it seems
obvious that the erection of further coining plants would
be a labour of foolishness. The Westralian people should
seriously consider the proposal.
• • • •
The ready acquiescence of the Hinglish authori-
ties to Westraha’s request for a Mint comes as a surprise,
though the thing would eventually be granted to any
province seriously wanting it, because it is no expense to
anyone but said province. The question of silver coinage,
which is not involved necessarily by authority for gold
coinage, has a different complexion, because fat revenues,
under the alias of “seignorage,” accrue to silver-minting
under the British gold monometallic system.

A return, which Tucker dragged with extreme
difficulty out of Shambles Patterson, shows that the Com-
missioners’ Savings Bank of Victoria has £2,010,650 of the
depositors’ money invested on mortgage. But no less
than £624,000 of its assets are represented by properties
which have been left in the hands of the bank, presumably
because the selling-value had gbl down below the amount
of the mortgage, and the owner found it more profitable
to let things slide. How far the value has got below the
mortgage may be roughly estimated by the fact that this
alleged £624,000 worth of bricks and dirt yielded last
year only 2 per cent, interest! The money was lent out at
an average rate of £5 ss. percent., and when the income
falls to the present level it looks as if rather more than
three-fifths of the total principal had vanished—for the
time, at all events. The Savinas Bank has committed the
usual mistake of going in for big mortgages; it has one
loan of £126,000, one of £BO,OOO, two of ±70,000, and so
on. In addition to its other troubles—of which the
Y.M.C.A. hall is one—it has £lB,OOO of outstanding inter-
est, which looks as if some more of its big investments
were beginning to smell audibly and would have to be
foreclosed at an early date. Altogether the report reads
more like a land-boomer’s schedule than anything else.

It’s an ill war that blows nobody good ; and the

John Chinaman to return the bread he has taken out of

The Bank of New Zealand pays no dividend
and carries forward the available balance of £38,000.
From this time forth, £40,000 per annum will have to be
found to pay interest on £1,000,000 of the State-
guaranteed stock—the other million is to he invested in
some fashion approved by Treasurer Ward, and will, pre-
sumably, earn its interest altogether apart from the bank’s
affairs—so the prospects of any dividend in the immediate
future are very thin. Shares (£5 ss. paid up) are offering
at 20s. with no buyers. The London board, which is now
giving up control, remarks that some provision will pro-
bably have to be made for more losses, which looks as if
another writing down of capital or reserve-fund was
already impending. This sort cf thing grows mono-
tonous, tor the B.N.Z. has been steadily writing off lost
capita! and reserves ever since ’BB. Possibly, however,
the statement is only the old board’s cheerful way of
throwing a brick at its successors.

The N.S.W. railways yield, for the year ending
30th June, ’94, a net interest of 3.46 per cent, on their
cost. If the N.S.W. debt could be all placed on a3J per
cent, basis they would thus, with the tramway revenue
thrown in, just pay their way ; or if Australia had a
Federal Government which could consolidate the pro-
vincial debts into one 3 per cent, stock they would show
a handsome profit. The net profits are £20,511 more than
last year ; the expenses have been reduced by £146,674 ;
rates have been diminished in several directions ; and a
very large amount of repairs and renewals have been
effected out of revenue which used to be charged, in a
great measure, to loan expenditure. Altogether the
Commissioners’ management has been an unqualified
success in almost every direction.

There is an Australian firm of “financial agents”
whose business pays well, even in these depressed times.
Their method; they advertise that they have £OOO,OOO to
lend on “approved pastoral securities.” A man pressed
by the banks will write to them, giving particulars of his
property and asking them if they think a loan could be
obtained. They reply that they regard the security
“very favourably,” and will, no doubt, lend the amount
asked, but in the meantime will require £1 for a parish
map and £5 (sometimes more) for a “search-tee.” In
nine cases out of ten the borrower will forward the
amount at once, and will thereafter remain in blissful
ignorance about his loan. Should he have the hardihood
to write again, he will receive a reply to the effect that
the amount asked was “too large” for the security
offered, or their principals did not care to advance in that
part of the country. As a matter of fact, the “ financial
agents” are mere adventurers, having neither trust-funds
nor principals. A parish map, it they bought one, would
cost Is., so that on every transaction, and they have
many, they are at least £5 19s. in pocket.

Dear Bulletin, —Now that there is a prospect
of tariff alteration, let N.S.W. have a duty on tea. I
declare that ever since tea has been free, it has been next
to impossible to buy a decent cheap tea in Sydney, Any
rubbish may be shot in, and as the risk of Govt, interfer-
ence is practically nil, the absence of the duty encourages
the practice. When I was in Melbourne three years ago,
despite the 3d. duty, you could obtain fair ration tea
retail at lOd. per lb., and the standard family tea, sold by
a big Bourke-street firm, and which possibly half the
people of Melbourne habitually used, was retailed at 1/3
per lb. The 3d. duty in N.S.W., combined with the con-
demnation of afew cargoes of spent rubbish, would improve
tne quality of the matutinal cup, and would not increase
the price to the consumer.—Thbobroma, Sydney.

The advantages to trade of redeemable paper
currency over metallic currency are great. The millions
of small payments made yearly through the post are each
and all hampered by “ exchange ” in one form or another,
metallic money being unsuited for posting. City shops
have to meet teeming multitudes of country orders every
month, and every payment made by the customers is un-
profitably taxed, because there is no medium of payment
except postage-stamps, post-office orders, cheques or
drafts, and on all of these "exchange” is necessary.

“ Australia’s Incubus,” by “ Zouabi,” is an ill-
written pamphlet advocating the abolition of banks and
interest, and the issue by Government of paper-money or
securities, without gold backing, and burdened only by a
charge of 1 per cent, for handling. The Government
would thus become a universal mortgagee, and the mort-
gagors would trade on the paper I O U’s guaranteed by
the total credit of all mortgagors. By-and-hye, when
everybody was a mortgagor, and had borrowed (say) £5OO
of paper-money from the State, there could be a general
cancellation of debits. Everybody would be £5OO richer,
and the process could begin again. In time everybody
would grow rich on paper-money, and poverty would be
abolished. “Zouabi” stopped two or three sentences
back, but The Bulletin has gone on chiefly for the sake
of showing how many kinds of an ass he is. There is only
one way to abolish banks and interest, and that is for
everybody to stop borrowing and live on a strictly cash
basis. The rest is mostly moonshine.

Apropos of the statement, in Mr. Henry Austin’s

the market for S. African wool. The advantages which

An Eastern mining-expert, hailing originally
from Geelong, has done much mine-inspection in Westra-
lia recently. Someone gave him 100 guineas the
other day to report on a mine, thinking that the cash
would much influence his opinion. What they got for
their 100 guineas was just this: “Have inspected your
mine as per agreement. Stayed there for a fortnight, and
found no gold worth mentioning. It is a duffer. If you
want detailed report, will be happy to supply same on
application.” Curiously enough, O is not known to
have ever erred on the side of enthusiasm.

Alick Forrest, of the Wealth of Nations syn-
dicate, is the latest and saddest victim of misplaced con-
fidence. He was “showing off” before a crowd of
diggers, and ostentatiously handed some of the Wealth
for inspection in the shape of a chunk of gold worth £l5O.
Then he turned his back and studied the horizon to see if
it looked like rain. When he was ready to pick up his
specimen again, it had vanished utterly, and everybody
swore he had passed it on. It hasn’t turned up yet; and
Alick thinks that that Tennyson chap, who considered
“simple faith more than Norman blood,” didn’t know
enough to light a fire under a condenser.

The “ Compagnie des Mines d’Or, Brown’s
Creek, N.5.W.,” which is now being floated in England,
will include some French capital, and will take over
Brown’s Creek Freehold, five miles from Blayney on the
N.S.W. western line. The deposit to be operated on by
the projected co. is about 1000 ft. long and, as is shown
by the surface workings, many scores of thousands of
tons have been removed. The mine was profitably worked
at various intervals for many years ; but it had for a con-
siderable time preceding the last six months or so been
closed owing to litigation. In faat, all the available evi-
dence goes to show that Brown’s Creek is a most legiti-
mate and promising, though in no way sensational, in-
vestment.
Brown’s Creek deposit is of the “thermal
spring ” class, and, judging by the No. 1 section- the only
one opened out to 200 ft. level—the bodies increase in size
and improving in richness with depth. The stuff is very
low-grade throughout, and has never yielded, and pro-
bably never will yield, anything more I ban a few
dwts. of low-grade gold per ton. But there are
millions of tons of this cheesy stuff to operate on,
and if there is any virtue in figures good money should
be made by working the show on a big scale. Four
bodies of ore have been worked from the surface to
150 ft. No. 1 deposit, which, as above stated, has been
opened as far as the 200 ft. level, is proved, open and
ready for stoping, for 240 ft. by 200 ft. The whole body
appears to be of pretty even quality, and promises to
keep 100-head of stamps going for many a long day. The
drive is now being carried to cut into and open the
other bodies. It is proposed to expend £25,000 in putting
the mine shipshape and erecting efficient plant. Brown’s
Creek looks likely to pay good returns long after many
of the sensational mines are exhausted.

Mr. Humphrey Oxenham, the
Australian - born bookmaker with
the unchallengeably English name,
whose portrait is printed in this
issue, is the “Two-to-one” sports-
man whom N.S.W. Premier Reid
rejently oast as a reproach at the
head of his predecessor Dibbs,
who, it was averred, contem-
plated appointing Humphrey
Oxenham aforesaid to the N.S.W.
Legislative Council. Mr. Oxenham
h the Leviathan fielder of this
country, the Behemoth book-
maker of Australia, and has risen
to his present dizzy altitude as a
metallician and horse-owner no
less by his love of sport for its
own sake than by his keenness and
pluck. The dual position of fielder
and owner is, in most cases, so in-
congruous as to have given birth
to that proverbial term of reproach,
“ The bookmaker’s horse.” But
no man’s horses ever ran straighter
than Humphrey Oxenham’s, whose
Pilot Boy, Utter, Solanum, Laura,
and other top-notch mokes have
ever been backed as confidently by
the public as by their owner. Mr.
Oxenham is by repute as charitable
ai lie is successful. He is a strong
Protectionist by political convic-
tion, and did good service for his
party at last N.S.W. general elec-
tion. He is too much a man of the
world to imagine that a man can
shine simultaneously in Parliamant
and in the ring, and he does not
aspire to the Treasurership, despite
the fact that any man possessed
of the acuteness displayed by him
in financing his huge turf transac-
tions, might reasonably expect to cot
a more than respectable figure at the Treasury.
General Debility.
The term General Debility means a depletion of
fital strength, a general break-up of the corporeal
health, due to over-consumption and wasting away
of the life-giving constituents of the blood and
nerve tissue, really a wearing out of the animal
structure. If your life is worth saving, it is worth
your while to treat your case thoroughly. If it is
worth your while to treat your disease at all, it is
worth your while to continue the treatment until
your health is thoroughly re-established; you may
feel all right after the first few bottles of Clements
Tonic, so prompt are its remedial and curative
effects; but a medicine, no matter how good,
cannot banish disease in a week, the seeds of
the complaint will still remain in your system
and break out afresh if you do not thoroughly
eradicate them. Don’t forget that a relapse is
twice as difficult to cure as the original attack, so
if you want to get cured give the remedy
a fair chance and recovery is_ certain. Clements
Tonic is a genuine article, it is prepared for
a specific purpose and contains the material to
make it an effectual remedy and if used
faithfully it cannot fail. We do not claim it
is a cure-all, we do not say it will cure
lock-jaw or bad spelling, but for all cases of im-
paired vital strength it is a scientific and infallible
specific. Moreover, the cost of using it is so small
you can have a year’s course of it for less than
you can procure a week’s medical attendance, and
a tenfold better remedy than any physician can
prescribe for you. Thousands of oases have been
cured by Clements Tonic, and it will cure you if
you give it a fair chance. Read the case of Mr.
Wm. Scott, manager A. J.S. Bank, Bega, N.S.W.,
who writes on April 21st, 1893 : —I have pleasure
in stating that I have from time to time found
much benefit from using your Clements ionio,
which I consider a really splendid one._ As a
rifle-shot I have found it useful in clearing the
sight and steadying the nerves. —'Yours faithfully,
Wm. Scott, manager A.J.S. Bank, Bega, N.b.W.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Apropos Corrigan, one thinks of slain Paddy
M'Qowan again. Both men, under family responsibilities,
j had become so cautious. There was Paddy, giving up the
steeplechase in toto, in response to his tearful little wife,
and killed on the flat in one of the comparative twopenny-
halfpenny races. Tom Corrigan would put his little two-
year-old youngster on a bare-backed horse and say, “ He
will soon ride a steeple,” but Mrs. Corrigan would shudder
and say, “Never!” It is expected that £2OOO will be
raised, at least, for Corrigan’s widow. Thus much was
got at the Caulfield race-meeting for “Augur” Chap-
man’s benefit, a while before his demise, enabling him to
leave a tidy dot. As much would be done for Corrigan,
striking the iron while hot.
* • • ♦
Corrigan’s ferocious moustachios, d la Victor
Emmanuel, led Australians at large mistakenly to fancy
him a big man. He was little, though strong, and with
the weight in the right place ; like Sammy Cracknel!, he
never had to waste. Sammy was tiny, the Flat ideal, the
boy in a big sandy beard. Corrigan’s own weight was
just the lowest for the Steepler, and he did not take to
that line, like most, merely because he put on too much
beef for the flat. Tommy, in the days of his glory, used
to race with a lot of stimulant aboard, but lately he
“schweared off.” Lucifer seemed to say—“No more
grog, no more wins.” The tender mercies of the wicked
are cruel.
» * * *
Corrigan’s most recent lucky escape was last
July, at Flemington, when riding in the Maiden Steeple-
chase. His horse, Password, at the second fence ran
across the jump, just as the field were “taking off.” Five
horses and jockeys, including Tommy, came down
together. It was about the most wonderful jumble
imaginable, but no one was hurt.
• • * • »
Corrigan’s case reminds us that even on English
courses the foremost steeplechase riders, such as the
Beasleys and the Moores, are Irish. Speaking of a horse
and a rider, Gordon wrote, “There was Celtic blood in the
pair.” In the P.R., another game demanding pluck and
nerve, Paddy is prominent.
* • * *
Is it “easy come, easy go,” or have jockeys’
winnings been exaggerated ? Tommy Corrigan died poor,
and a competent authority declares that, with one excep-
tion, no N.S.W. jockey is above his calls pecuniarily.

Mr. Frank P. Mahony, the Australian animal
painter, has just finished a portrait of the celebrated
racer, Abercorn, to the commission of his owner, Mrs.
James White. Abercorn is well-known to all lovers of
sport in Australasia, who unanimously agree in the
opinion that he is one of the handsomest horses that ever
cantered over a racing-track south of the line. He is,
indeed, a remarkably beautiful creature, standing
16-1 in height; in colour, of a glossy chestnut, witn
white lace and white feet. His sire, Chester, was a
dark-brown horse, and Cinnamon, his dam, was of a light-
brown colour. Abercorn, himself, is a curious instance
of atavism. Many of our best strains of racers_ have a
tendency to throw back to original types ; and this tend-
ency is well exemplified in the case of Abercorn, who is
wonderfully like old Stockwell, the English sire of Blair
Athol and many other brilliant performers on the Eng-
lish turf. Already has Abercorn begun to show the
Stockwell markings, white patches that appear at a cer-
tain age in particular parts of the body in this especial
strain. Bred by the late Hon. James White, Abercorn,
whose legs are as sound as on the day he was foaled,
is the finest specimen of the equine race springing from
his owner’s stable. There are rumours that English
breeders have made overtures for the purchase of the
horse, but fortunately Mrs. White, Abercorn’s present
owner, has declined to entertain them. Mr. Mahony has
achieved a veritable triumph in the portrait of this cele-
brated racer. His picture, the best of the kind he has
ever painted, is modelled with the certainty of *n
anatomist, and is a beautiful presentment of a beautiful
horse.

Joe Thompson has been on the wrong side of
the fence ever since he went to England. He was effu-
sively welcomed by princely bookmakers, such as Peach
and Pry, perhaps, in some degree, because he indicated
that America would be his field. However, his racing-
track idea for San Francisco would not work. The English
books gave him a fair show till he began to show his hand
in tactics of cutting down prices—f.e., lengthening out
odds. Then they set up their backs and got on their hind
leo-s. A man cannot fight his trade. The simple deter-
mination of the English books at one time was to ruin
Joe. Perhaps not so now.

Dear Bulletin, —It is about time that the aged
allegation—used by Frank Madden as an argument in the
course of the Vic. Assembly totalisator debate —that
racing, as now carried on, tends to the improvement of
useful light horses, was burst up. How can racing have
that effect? An excellent racehorse is an animal which
can, after months of tender care and special preparation,
carry 8 or 9st. from 5 to 12 furlongs, at the rate of about
13sec. per furlong, over prepared ground, twice or thrice
a year for three years. A bad or indifferent racehorse is
one which cannot do this. One which can carry a stone
more as fast is a marvel, and one able to carry lOst. three
miles at a slightly lower rate of speed is an equine god—
a veritable Carbine—which all men worship. As such a
phenomenon “ turns into the straight,” ahushseltleson the
multitude (vide “Nemo” and co.), and a thrill pervades
every frame. All racehorses, despite the extreme care
taken of them, are always more or less ‘‘gone in the pins."
Now, a good saddle-horse is one able to carry, with ease
to himself and the rider, 14st., or more, over a natural
surface 60 miles in 10 hours, 250 miles in a week, or 700
miles in a month, when fed upon good, natural grasses.
And this for two months of every year for ten or a dozen
years. A saddle-horse unsound in the legs is useless.
Indian “remounts” must be of even a better class. What
possible chance is there, then, that horses of the two
classes last mentioned can be derived from a stock intelli-
, gently selected and mated with a view of producing race-
horses as above described ? If the argument was that
Australian steeplechasing tended to improve the breed of
saddle-horses, much could be said in support of it; but
our flat-racing tends wholly to the production of spavined
weeds, with excitable tempers, and will until the mini-
mum weight is raised to 9st.—P.H. Queensland, 11th
Aug., ’94.

The big Melb. football match ended in an easy

Editor Bulletin,—The par. in your issue of

reference to detailed reports in recognised sporting press

because he was knocked out. M‘Guire, not I, was cau-
tioned by the referee for striking in a clinch. As to
"tactics re stake,” it should not be necessary to point
out that pugilism is as much a business as journalism ;
and if the conditions on which I agree to fight are not
fulfilled, I have every right to refuse risking ray body and
reputation before an empty house. And it does seem
hard that a Sydney lad, in addition to facing Melb. bar-
rackers, should be slated in a Sydney-printed paper,

Gov. Hopetoun was down in Flemington
Saddling Paddock just before the running of the race
which proved fatal to Corrigan ; and after some compli-
mentary words about the looks of himself and his horse,
the Governor cordially wished the favourite jockey
“ good luck *’ just as he was going through the gate. The
rider turned and said; “ Don’t you wish you were going
out with us, sir ? ” The last words he spoke.

The T. and J. Bernard Brewery, of Edin-

crop for the third time in succession. The output
of this brewery is now 1200 hogsheads per week,
and increasing; owing entirely to the splendid
quality of the product.
If you want to encourage employees to
embezzle your cash don’t purchase the National
Cash Registrar from Fisher and Lingham, V ictoria
Arcade, Sydney. This wonderful little instru-
ment saves its cost in the first few weeks by

number of customers and the amount each pays,
and the total in the till at any moment. 1 isher

Typewriter, which every intending purchaser
should inspect.
Any person or persons who will undertake
to supply Australia with a system of cheap and
efficient dentistry should be hailed as benefactors
to the race. For Australians are the “ gummiest
nation on earth. It has been computed by an
eminent local medical official that out of every
ten Australians not two are possessed of a per-
fectly sound set of grinders. And out of the
remaining eight not more than two per cent,
ever buy new teeth or get the old ones seen
to.” The reason of this is obvious : the
prices which obtain for good dentistry are
so inordinately high that people can’t afford to
pay for it, and, consequently, die early like the
eminent English Dr. Wm. Jelly did, other
day, of accumulations of undigested food in the
stomach. Dr. Jelly had only three teeth. The
founders of the London Dental Institute, who
have opened an excellently appointed establish-
ment at 98 King-street, Sydney, are going to alter
all that. Having engaged the best English and
American operators, and provided themselves
with the most highly improved mechanical appli-
ances, they intend to combine the very best
workmanship with charges within the reach
of the poorest. Single tooth, from 2s. 6d., and a
complete set from a guinea. Gas (which is os.
extra) is administered in the presence of a duly
qualified physician attached to the staff —or the
patient can, without extra fee, have his or her
own physician to attend. Clergymen, M.sP., and
members of the theatrical profession are seen on
special terms. After this, anyone found wander-
ing about the streets minus a complete set of
molars should get a month without the option.*
Wool and Produce Reports.
M'Bcrnkt, Wallis & Co. report.—No auctions this
week, but prices are still firm at late rates. At last the
tariff struggle in America seems settled in favour of the
free admission of wool. Our wool producers should feel
happy at the news, for in it lies a promise of brisker com-
petition at our sales in the coming season, and, conse-
quently, prices in excess of those paid last year. Even
now, without the full buying strength in our sale-room,
the few lots of new wool that have been offered have com-
manded a ready sale at prices highly satisfactory to
owners. Some little trouble has been caused on some of
the larger stations at the start of shearing, but labour is
so plentiful that men who strike can easily be replaced,
and we are happy to see that the majority of shearers are
thinking for themselves, instead of following the lead of
agitators, with the result that shearing, as a whole, will
progress without a hitch. Given good roads, our wool
sales should be in swing a little earlier this year than last.
Sydney, Aug. 18, 1894.
New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company,
Limited, report;—The Sydney wool-market has responded
to the improvement in general trade which has resulted
from the recent fiscal changes in the United States, and
prospects for the forthcoming wool-season are exceedingly
encouraging. When, about a week ago, it was announced
that the Conference Committee appointed by the Upper
and Lower branches of the U.S. Legislature, had broken
up without arriving at any decision on the points at issue
it appeared almost certain that the proposed tariff re-
ductions would never become law. Later news, hovvever,
states that the Lower House accepted the alternative of
falling in with the amendment made in the Tariff Reform
Bill by the Upper House, and passed the measure
in its altered form. The new Act is expected
to come into force this month, and the settlement of
this vexed question, which for so long a period has
paralysed trade, not only in the United States but in
many quarters in Europe, has at once created a large
amount of confidence in commercial circles. Latest
advices from Yorkshire report an advance in Bradford
“tops” quotations of £d. per lb., and in London some of
the wools held over from the last auction-sales have been
quitted at prices which mark an improvement of about 5
per cent. Several American buyers are now understood
to be on their way to Sydney, and their presence in our
market will, no doubt, assist to impart a lively turn to
the proceedings in the wool sale-room, when the selling
gets into full swing.

Australia should follow the lead of the practical
Yankee by encouraging trotting as well as racing. The
latter sport—if any swindling institution can be correctly
so-called -is supposed to improve the breed of horses, but
it only calls into existence a lot of speedy weeds to the
detriment of real equine stoutness. Its practical results
are nil. Everyone, from the butcher-boy to the commer-
cial traveller, is interested in the trotter.

Ned Hanlan has promised the world a champion
sjuller in E. Durnan, said to be his own nephew. But
Hanlan’s opinion, even in sculling matters, is not worth
much. While his affairs and himself were managed by
David Ward, of Toronto, he was invincible; when he
began to think for himself defeat soon followed. Had
Ward accompanied him to Australia, as on the first two
trips to England, it is hard to say how the history of
sculling might have been altered. At any rate, Hanian’s
style of living on the Parramatta would have been
different.

Editor Bulletin.— Sir,—l trust as you
have endeavoured to belittle Mr. Watson, the
Parliamentary Labour candidate for Cook division,
Sydney, you will give the other side of the man
you make so much of. 1. Mr. Traill voted on the
7th December, 1892, for a Bill to repeal payment
of members, introduced by Mr. Molesworth. His
excuse was that he voted for its introduction for
the purpose of throwing it out. Where does
brains come in here ? 2. He supported the Aus-
tralian Rights Purchase Bill, one of the grossest
monopolies ever introduced into the House. 3. He
voted for the Bank Notes Issue Bill. He voted
in 1892 session 98 times, when the highest by a
Labour member was 436; session 1892-93, 21 —
Labour, 117; 1893-4, 39—Labour, 159; his' vote
cost the country about <£6, while Labour costs
about .£1 10s. Had this been known to the
electors he would not have received the votes he did.
The Labour man went down through sectarian-
ism.—Yours, &c., A. M‘Lean, League Sec.
[l. Traill has always supported payment of mem-
bers, and his vote for Molesworth’s bill was a
purely formal or courtesy one to enable the bill to
be discussed. 2. The Bulletin, which initiated
the attack on the Rights Bill, doesn’t seek to
justify Iraill s vote thereon ; but it can excuse his
vote for the Bank Bill under the circumstances.
3. Men are not to be altogether judged by their
attendances at the House. Otherwise a man of
the G. D. Clark type might be accounted more
valuable than a George Washington. Mr. M‘Lean
says the Labour-man went down through “ sec-
tarianism. As a matter of fact, the so-called
Labour-man’s chance was nil from the start, and as
all he could hope to do was to split Traill’s votes,
his candidature can only be excused on the
theory that he was run in the interests of Mr.
Whiddon and the National Association.—Ed. B.]
HOW TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK.
“ What time is it, Maggie?” said John, with an
uneasy sense that he ought to be on his homeward
way.
V I’M R° arl d look,” she answered. Stepping
quietly into the kitchen the girl pushed the clock
hands back an hour, and returning, said, “It’s
only half-past nine by our clock ; you can stay an
hour longer.”
So John stayed, for lovers are never eager to
part, and he needed no coaxing. The next morning,
however, he overslept himself, and Maggie’s
father, at his breakfast, having missed the train
he intended to journey by that day, wondered how
the good old clock could have lost an hour in the
night. But Maggie didn’t explain. She meant
to set it right again before going to bed, but forgot,
which shows once more what everybody should
remember—that we can set back the clock, but we
cannot set back the time.
All the same it is possible occasionally to regain
lost things. In a woman’s letter recently received,
I find this sentence : “ They tell me I look ten years
younger than I did.'” And if she felt as she
looked, she was, to all practical purposes, ten years
younger. For, although a clock face looks the
same, no matter what time it is, a human face
doesn’t. That changes with the condition of the
“works,” or the life behind it.
The letter goes on thus : “In the spring of 1880
I felt weak and low. I had a bad taste in the
mouth, and a thick, slimy phlegm covered my
mouth and tongue. I was sick in a morning,
retching and vomiting a watery fluid. I had
great pain in the head and was very mazy, being
at times so bad I could hardly stand upon my
feet. After eating the simplest food I had dread-
ful pain in my chest, and a tightness across the
chest and sides. For hours together I have sat
before the fire rubbing my chest to try and get
relief. I had great pain in the left side and pal-
pitation of the heart, and could get but little sleep
at night on account of it.
“Gradually I grew weaker and weaker until
I could scarcely walk about the house, and but
for the necessity of attending to my family, I
should have been laid up. My life was a burden
and a misery to me, and I often wished myself
dead. J
“ Sometimes better, and at other times worse;
this was my general condition for ten vears., during
which long period of suffering I was treated by the
doctor, and took every kind of medicine I could
hear tell of, buc got no better.
“In November, 1890, I read in a book of a
medicine called Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup
and got a bottle from Mr. E. Banks, the chemist!
After I had taken a few doses 1 found my food
agreed with me better. I kept on with the Syrup
and gradually gained strength. I bad become
so thin and emaciated through all those years of
suffering that it took time to fully restore me.
But I am now in better health than I ever was in
my life, and my recovery has astonished my
friends. J hey tell me I look ten years younger
than I did before taking the Syrup. How I wish I
had known of it years sooner ! My husband and
friends had given up all hope of my getting
better, but none of us knew of Mother Seigel’s
Syrup.
“On mentioning to the Rev. E. Harries, the
Vicar of Christ Church, what had wrought the
cure, he said I should write and let the proprietors
know what the Syrup had done for me, so as to
benefit others. You may publish this statement
as you think proper, and I will gladlv answer
enquiries. Yours truly, (signed) (Mrs.) Elizabeth
Greenhalgh, 21, Rutland Street, Newtown, Pendle-
bury (near Manchester), May 14th, 1892.”
Thus was this good woman enabled—not to
turn back her nominal age, but what was better—
to recover the priceless treasure of health, without
which neither youth nor age has any comfort.
H^ r malady was the same wretched indigestion
and dyspepsia, the curse of all ages and nations.
Dear Bulletin, —Why go all the way to
Sarah Grand to learn that “ Girls are brought up
for the inarriage-rnaiket like fatted fowls ?”
Sydney s own “Faustine,” a few weeks ago, com-
pared to the plump partridge who has to run the
gauntlet of the “sedual game laws.”
Australian women are notoriously fond of
tea, but the Princess of Wales attaches so much
importance to her “afternoon tea” that on Sun-
day afternoons she attends a church at some dis-
tance, instead of the Chapel Royal, St. James’s,
because the sub-dean could not change the time of
the service to allow H.R.H. to drink her cup o’
tea at the usual hour.
“ Alas ! ” sang a corned poet, “ what boots
it with incessant care to ply the homely, slighted
shepherd's trade?” He might more profitably
have asked, “ I say, how pays it with incessant
care to slight the home-made, splendid Ellis
boots?” Half the world wear Ellis’s boots-
obtainable opposite the Town Hall, Sydney; or
Hunter-street, Newcastle. The other half is
going to.
A new idea is mooted by “ Unlimited,”
elsewhere advertised. Everybody wants things,
and it is suggested that you should get things
and give things through “ Unlimited ” —a co-
operative medium of exchange for bringing desires
and satisfactions together. The scheme soundly
conducted is quite practicable, and has a cash
value to the public directly corresponding with
the measure of their support.
THE SPORT OF KINGS.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There was a sport, a Sport of Kings,
How we loved the beat of its flying feet
And the sheen of its silken wings!
How we lived in its hopes and fears.
And scarce could breathe till it’s laurel wreath
Was won in a storm of cheers 1
There was a Lust of Gain
We longed for the gold our sports might hold.
And the Sport of Kings was slain.
But we tired of the fight for gold,
Of the sordid lie and the roguery,
And we yearned for the sport of old.
But the men were a different race
Prom each honoured name that had raced for Fame
And striven for Pride of Place.
And we bowed to the Truth at last,
And we sadly said—" Our Sport lies dead
And the days of Racing ate past.”

ponding member, but also awarded him their gold
medal and diploma of honor.”— Flashes (Society

Appended are reports upon the properties in question by Mr. Jonathan Bray, manager of the

Fortune of War Gold Mine.
A plan of the leases is shown herewith.
Reports hy Mr, Q, Wingate, M.E,
OUDDINGWABEA, “ DEAD FINISH,” BOTH MAY, 1894.
Mb. J. A. Sandebson. Sib, —I have the honour to report inspecting the “ Blue Bell ’’ Gold Mine,
the property of Mr. Grant, which consists of five acres, and has seven chains on the line of reef along-
side of the Cue road, about a mile north of the “Fortune of War” and “ Victory ” Gold Mining
Companies—both of these companies being on good gold.
The lode is found cropping on the surface, is of a highly auriferous character, and there has been
a considerable amount of gold shed from this crop—dry-blowing being resorted to on the surface, and
was attended with good payable results. This has all come from this lode.
The lode itself is small on the surface, gradually widening as the shaft has been sunk to its present
depth of 25 feet, where the lode presents a very permanent appearance—from a foot to 15 inches, and
going down very strong. When it gets to water-level the stone is highly auriferous.
I had prospects broken out in my presence and crushed, and, in my opinion, the result would be
three to four ounces per ton, or it may go more; it is said it will go six ounces.
The stone has a lot of mineral distributed all through it. The stone is stained with copper, and it
abounds in decomposed iron and galena—all these different minerals being usually found in lodes that
carry plenty of gold.
I think this is a splendid property, and when fully developed will prove a source of great wealth
to the fortunate owners.
Any company acquiring this property will require to sink a main shaft to develop this mine to a
deeper level. The shafts at present on the mine will come in for air or any purpose they might be put
to. For instance, if a company chose, while their main shaft was going down, they could stope out
the reef from the present underlie shaft, which is down, as already noted, 25 feet, and driven south
23 feet, and also to the north 15 feet, making a total of 38 feet, which, in my opinion, would of itself
pay for any outlay that might be incurred erecting suitable machinery, lor the purpose of properly
working this mine of wealth. —I have the honour to be. Sir, your obedient servant,
G. WINGATE, M. 8., Manager “ Fortune of War ” Mine.
“ Dead Finish,” 30th Mat, 1894.
Mb. J. A. Sanderson, Sir, —I beg to report visiting the “ Blue Bell Extended ” Company’s pro-
perty, which consists of five acres; has seven chains oh the line of reef by six chains thirty links. This
property is adjoining the “ Blue-bell ” on the north, and I find just on this boundary the lode shows
very strong, measuring two feet in places, and still showing good gold in the breaking. The shoots of
gold in the adjoining mine are all dipping to the north, and there is no doubt but these shoots will
traverse this lease from end to end. There will also be found shoots of gold cropping to the surface in
this lease, independent of the shoots dipping into it from the “ Blue Bell,” as there is an extensive
area of ground just around here where dry blowing was resorted to with such good results, and there is
no doubt this gold was shed from this rich lode.
This being all virgin ground, with the “Blue Bell ”on the south, I beg to congratulate you on
being the fortunate possessors of such a wealthy area of ground, which, in my opinion, is one of the
best in W.A. —I have the honour, &c., G. WINGATE, M.E., Manager “ Fortune of War ” Mine.
Report by Mr. Jonathan Bray.
Tbenton Mine, Day Dawn, Mukohison, 14 July, 1894.
Mb. J. A. Sandkbson, Ouddingwabba, Mubchxson. Deab Sib,— Acting on your instructions
I have examined the blocks, numbers 316 and 434, better known as the “ Blue Bell ” Mine, situated
at Cuddingwarra.
On going over the ground I find these blocks consist of five acres each, on a north and south line,
and that nearly the whole work of development has been confined to the south block, on which three
shafts have been sunk, two of them to water level, about 27 feet, and the third about 7 or 8 feet.
These shafts are situated a considerable distance from each other, one being about 70 feet from the
south boundary, the next one to it is 300 feet further to the north, and the other between 60 and 70
feet still further. I cannot discover that the reef outcrops anywhere on the claim, the only indications
of the reef are a few floating stones on the surface. Besides the beforementioned shafts, some small
intermediate trenches have been cut, which have all exposed the lode to view, in every instance small,
from 6 inches to 1 foot, and slightly irregular in its course, which is approximately 26° east of north,
and the underlie is 50° east.
I began my underground examination at the south shaft, where the most work has been done, and
a paddock of very nice-looking stone—about 60 tons —has been raised. At the surface of this shaft
the reef is about 6 inches, at a depth of 16 feet it is 15 inches, and at the bottom —27 feet—it is 30 inches.
Of course, without appliances other than manual labour to raise the water, going deeper is quite
out of the question. In this respect the water is a great hindrance, but when arrangements are made
for systematic working it will become invaluable.
At the bottom of this shaft the reef has been driven on both ways—north and south—for a dis-
tance of 25 feet, and a small stope taken from the back of each, from which the bulk of the stone at
grass has been taken. By measuring this and the space from which it was taken, I estimate the lode to
average 16 inches.
1 took samples both from the stopes and the bottom of the shaft. From the samples taken from
the bottom I obtained good three ounce prospects ; those taken from the stopes were not quite so good,
but I consider them highly payable. On examining the country rock, I find the foot wall or western
side of the reef to be composed of very hard fine-grained dionte, and that of the hanging wall a free,
soft clay slate, very favourable to the existence of lodes ; and this, together with the proven great
length of stone, leads me to believe that the lode will increase in size as depth is attained.
The middle shaft, 100 yards farther to the north, has had no work done in it but just the bare
sinking ; it commences with about 6 inches of stone, and at 15 feet the stone had increased to 18 inches.
From that point down the shaft is sunk in the foot wall with the stone left hanging. The few tons of
stone raised show that the gold still continues, but not nearly so rich as that of the south shaft.
The shaft 70 feet further north has been sunk about 7 feet on the stone, which started with 6
Inches of stone and did not increase in size. Although small, I have little doubt of making her big
when followed down. Some of this is exceptionally nice, being of a different character from any of the
other stone, and with very fine gold impregnated all through it.
I have every confidence that your mine has a successful future before it,
I remain, yours faithfully, JONATHAN BRAY.

“Fresh discoveries are reported every week around ‘Dead Finish,* which is fast becoming an
important mining centre. The ‘ South Day Dawn ’ battery has started Successfully, and has a good
supply of water. Several thousand tons of first-class stone, from the ‘ Light of Asia ’ and other local
mines, are awaiting treatment, but the manager proposes crushing for his own company for the first
month. The ‘Fortune of War* battery will start in ten days, and ‘ Trenton ’ four days later. The
* Cue * public battery has an excellent water supply, and will start immediately. Martin and party
brought in over 400 ounces from Peak Hill, and from all indications the Murchison field is entering
upon an era of prosperity.
“ The quarterly mining returns are still incomplete, but so far they give a yield of 60,000 ounces
for the Murchison ; but there is more to come, exclusive of large quantities taken direct to Geraldton.
Over an inch of rain fell during the last fortnight. Feed and water along the road are plentiful.
Fisher’s claim is looking extremely well. A crushing of 100 tons at the ‘Day Dawn ’ battery gave
three ounces to the ton. The stone was taken from below the water level. A half-interest in the
mine is held by W. R. Wilson’s syndicate. All their properties are looking well.”

It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy

This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its

Ode on the Decay of the Maori Race.
(Written in Queen Charlotte Sound.)
[FOR THE BULLKTIN.]
L
Hearken, O pine-groves, to the sullen thunder
Prisoned among the gaunt defiles of cloud,
Shaking the azure of the wave in wonder
To the Almighty’s chariot-wheels low bowed
Beneath the summits of the peaks, scar smitten
In an archaic hurricane of flame,
Flashing in jagg&d letters his great name
Through the felt darkness momentarily litten.
Never are voices of the happy mortals,
The Maori children, heard among your leaves,
Only the weary mistral sways your portals,
And to the untrod wilderness it cleaves.
Hark how each twilight colonnade of branches
Shudders with inward moan to ceaseless tears
Slid from the quiet rain, and all the years
No kissing sun the endless flowing stanches.
Weep ye the glories of a race
Primeval in the untold grave,
Carpeted by the foliage flung with grace
Of Nature’s pity in a feathery wave;
Wreaths of sombre fern
In mossy-curven dell,
Where the dust lieth in an urn
Of secret gold and coralline shell.
Can the spirit, poised in ecstasy,
Hoar their chants once more,
Love plaints, and in full-throated majesty
Barbaric songs of war ?
11.
The being who created ye,
With spirit furrow’ed by sublime emotion,
Ages agone, amid the torrid ocean,
Whence ye did branch to these low-lying shores
Like spiritual madrepores,
To what infernal doom has he oblated ye?
Wherefore have ye come through sorrow,
Weariness, and pain,
Leaving your bones to moulder in a soil
That shall not thrive beneath your children’s toil,
For ye are passing like the midnight rain,
That is not here to-morrow.
What is baptised in blood
Is dedicated in a temple.
Where listening gods grow pale and tremble
To the curses of a multitude.
The generations they foresee to come,
At wliose tribulation deities are dumb.
Nature worketh through delirious means
To an adorable supreme ;
Like phantoms of a haggard dream
That waketh in benumbed affright
They pass before prophetic sight.
The aureoled zone of love’s demesnes
Shines o’er a sea of sorrow-,
Beckoning through darkness like a star
To spirits that would touch the balmy morrow,
But die upon the night afar,
Man draweth out his destiny
Through wretchednesses manifold,
And centuries of wrath are told
Before the dawn of charity.
Saddest they who have not seen
The guerdon—as a meteor shower
That ponreth ardour hour by hour
Through the impalpable serene.
Dying upon the threshold of the globe,
Leaving an incense on her trailing robe.
111.
But ye have never felt the growth
Of gradual sweetness in the soul
That slowly turneth to the pole
Of charity— oh, piteous sloth
Of all the richness that is hid
Within the heart to overflow,
And now it is too late to know.
And God ordained what ye did.
Too late ! For ye are faint and weak,
Ye are the remnant of a race,
And there is light upon your face
Such as on Aorangi’s peak
Before the sun has sunk the verge;
And I can hear the far-off moan
Of dying warriors all alone,
As melancholy as the surge.
Too late ! For you the unfulfilled,
The struggle and the agony
Of eyes that look but cannot see,
So soon in darkness to be stilled.
But surely it shall be your pain
Shall weigh with some sublime decree,
And evermore your joy shall be
Ye have not suffered here in vain.

Dear Bulletin, —Mankind has only th e
Talmages and M.‘Neills it deserves, since “Evan-

will go hopelessly bung the moment the human
sheep discovers the colossal impudence of the
assumption by one man that he knows more about
post-mortem possibilities than another. And the
hugeness of the joke lies in the fact that for the
specially “Christian” of judg-
ment and kindness of heart—you must, as a rule,

The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil

mu *v? ip °*
I he Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.»
, public eye rejects as uninteresting more
an half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It i s only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
Ihb Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushrnan of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent buslnnan must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

True Friendship.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
On his death-bed lay the Burglar, and a calm and
holy smile
Shone upon his rugged features, worn from
staying out o’ nights;
-tor the Parson had been with him, and that party
free from guile
Had converted him to grace and set his soul’s
accounts to rights.
By his bedside sat his pal, who was a cracksman
tried and true,
And adown his weather-beaten cheeks the tears
«< n P n fast anc * free—
Don’t take on so !” said the dying man, “ for
b Ime if you do
111 be d dif I won’t go and die a sinner,
Bill—that’s me/”
Bill the Cracksman was too true a pal to put the
soul of him
Who had been his mate in danger, so he said—
“ Oh, shut your trap !
When you’ve got a soft thing keep it —die a
bloomin’ Chrischin, Jim.
And when I croak I may get a lift from some
white-chokered chap.”
Jim the Burglar sighed a grateful sigh, and said—
“ Don’t weep for me,
It’s a thick ’im to a steever we shall meet again,
old man !
When St, Peter isn’t looking,” here he gasped,
“I’ll prig his key-,
And, you bet your life, I’ll drop it in the old
place, if I can.”
With these last words on his dying lips the
Burglar closed his eyes,
And his life on earth was over. But, with all
his ancient skill,
He’s a-sbadowing St. Peter through the streets of
Paradise,
Looking out to get a slant to steal his key to
send to Bill.

blessed truth when rightly applied, but, in my
opinion, dangerous when applied indiscrimi-

whilst her husband, the “General,” thumped the
drum, and was, on her own showing, the most
dangerous female of her time. The Salvation

its blessed penny nostrum.
Sample of “ society ” information from an
English paper:—
The Prince of Wales, while sitting upon his charger
during the customary religious service at his presentai ion
of colours to the 2nd Worcester Regiment, at Aldershot,
last week, joined the men in singing loudly, “Onward.
Christian Soldiers.” His Royal Highness could also be
distinctly heard joining in the lesser litany and the Lord’s
Prayer, which quite pleased the Bishop of Worcester, who
stood by the drums of the regiment, upon which rested
the unfurled new colours (which we last week described)..
In his address at the luncheon the Prince smiled when he 1
spoke of giving the old colours to the battalion when he
was serving with the Guards on the Curragh of Kildare
just thirty-three years ago, when the old 36th was
brigaded with the Guards, and when drinking to (he
health of the Queen His Royal Highness quaffed off his
glass of champagne like a thirsty Oavalry-man gulps down
a pot of beer.
His Royal Highness could be distinctly heard
joining in the Lord’s Prayer. Look at that, now!
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. by uage

A NOVEL CURB FOR INFLUENZA.
The following is a clipping from the New
Zealand Mail, of 20th July, 1894:—“A well-
known Napier resident writes to one of the local
papers describing what he properly calls “a novel
cure for influenza.” We have most of us suffered
from an onslaught of the Grippe fiend—l know I
have and although this Napier gentleman’s
“ cure ” may astonish and affright my friends, the
prohibitionists, I feel it a public duty to give it
more extended publicity. After describing his
attack a specially sevez'e one it must have been,
judging by the details given—the writer proceeds :
“ A friend advised me, as a novel experiment, to
try Wolfe’s Schnapps, not to drink it, but by way
of a gargle. Not having heard of such a practice
before, I determined to give it a trial, and from
half-past six to half-past ten used three good
nobblers of Schnapps, and gargled the throat
thoroughly with it, spitting it carefully out and
burning the whole of the phlegm on hot coal ashes
to prevent re-infection. The amount of diseased
matter that was drawn from the head by the
gargle was very large, and evidently it seemed to
have pumped it nearly all out; then I took a
nobbier internally for the purpose of chasing
any microbes that might have taken the
road to the stomach by mistake. This treat-
ment seems to have been perfectly successful'
in my case; and it is well-known that alcohol
will destroy animalculae, and it seems to.
have cleared my throat entirely and also stopped;
the pains in the joints; therefore, it seems to me>
that the public should be made acquainted with;
this treatment, for it may be of value to humanity,,
and I trust that others will give it a trial and let’
the result be known. As these microbes are said!
to object to tobacco as well as alcohol, I smoked a.
cigar and exhaled the fumes through the nostrils,
and this in connection with the gargle seemed to

Democratic Federation,
SOME SUGGESTIONS BY MR. J. G. DRAKE.
Editor Bulletin,— Your recent article on Dibbs’
Federation policy has emboldened me to submit
to you some suggestions for Federation upon a
Democratic basis. It is not often that I disagree
with your attitude on this question, but I cannot
quite go with you in your qualified approval of
the Dibbs scheme. At first I was inclined to
regard it as a jocular proposal on the part of the
N.S.W. Premier to take over Victoria —assets and
liabilities —as an insolvent concern, and liquidate
her. The only good I find in his letter is the con-
demnation of the Convention performance, and
that is superfluous.- Allow me to give you briefly,
as the limits of a newspaper necessitate, my
views.
* * *
The first thing necessary is to have a clear con-
ception of the purposes for which the Federation
of the Australian provinces is desirable, and of
the relative importance of those purposes. The
prime necessity for Federation arises, in my
judgment, in connection with Defence—Defence
against two forms of danger, viz., (1) hostile in-
vasion, and (2) industrial aggression, through the
systematic introduction of cheap labour (of what-
ever kind), or of the products of such labour.
These matters are of the most vital importance,
and they are exactly those which, to a greater
degree than any other, can be better undertaken and
more efficiently dealt with by a Federal body than
they could be by separate and disunited provinces.
The first—hostile invasion—is of such a deadly
nature as to comprehend all other misfortunes,
and I, therefore, give it the place of first import-
ance; the second—industrial aggression—though
not quite so fatal in its nature (because remedi-
able up to a certain, though undefined point), is
an ever-present evil, one which is already upon us,
and which will tend to intensify itself unless met
and coped with in the early stages of its growth.
These evils are equally the concern of all the
provinces. A hostile invasion of Tasmania would
be a deadly injury to all the provinces, just as the
constant influx of Asiatics into Queensland and
the Northern Territory, and the importation of
the products of cheap labour into New South
Wales, is an industrial and very serious injury to
the whole of Australia. The Asiatic invasion has
already impressed itself upon the people of Aus-
tralia as being equally a matter of common con-
cern, on whatever point of the coast the landing
may be effected.
* * *
Neither of the schemes put before the people of
Australia up to the present time is, in my opinion,
likely to lead to any workable system of Federa-
tion. The Commonwealth Bill, product of the
Convention of 1891, may be put on one side at
once. Any proposal to force the warm life of
Australia into a rigid, machine-made mould is
foredoomed to failure. Federation, to be healthy,
should be a growth, and the first long step towards
Federation is gained when the provinces can
agree to come together for even one purpose.
Speaking of federal government, Freeman says
that is “ a more delicate and artificial struc-
ture” than either the kingdom or the independent
city ; “ its perfect form is a late growth of a very
high state of political culture; it is, even more
than other forms of government, essentially the
creation of circumstances, and it will, even less
than other forms, bear thoughtlessly trans-
planting to soils where circumstances have
not prepared the ground for it. But the
Convention Bill bears birth-marks which con-
demn it utterly ; and the one permanently use-
ful result of the Convention will be to demonstrate
for ever the futility of attempting, at this stage of
Australian history, to foist any Imperialistic yoke
on to the necks of the people of Australia. It was
the natural outcome of the deliberations of a little
body of self-elected notables, and should be a
warning for all time to the people of Australia not
to plant thistles and look to gather grapes there-
from.
* * *
The scheme of Mr. Dibbs, if simpler in its
conception than the Convention scheme, appears
to me to be equally far, though not in the same
direction, from the highway that leads to Austra-
lian Federation, in that it is directly opposed to
the tendency apparent in Australia, and more
especially in Queensland, towards further segre-
gation for the purpose of securing to particular
districts the benefits of self-government. Whether
we approve of that tendency or not is quite
another matter. It is a fact that has to be
reckoned with, and if we are going to build with
an idea to permanence, we must recognise facts
and shape our course in obedience to them. Per-
sonally, I think that the prospects of Federation
are more hopeful where there are a number of
Provinces of fairly equal dimensions and strength,
than where they are few in number, and (most
objectionable of all, from the point of view of a
federalist) where one province is so large and
powerful as to practically overshadow the others.
Were Victoria to accept the scheme of Mr.
Dibbs, Federation would, I venture to think, be
postponed until the natural forces that make for
segregation had worked out the disunion of the
united province, or perhaps its division into
several units. On the other hand, with a good
system of Federation, I see no reason why the
tendency towards segregation should not be
allowed fair play up to the limit at which it is
checked by the counteracting tendency towards
federation for the purpose of obtaining united
action in regard to our external dealings.
* • «
Both the schemes have the same fault in that
they leave out of count the people who are to be
governed and who are to provide the necessary
means for carrying on the government. This is
the fault that runs through the whole system of
government as we see it in operation in the various
provinces. It is that which produces the weak-
ness, vacillation, and uncertainty so noticeable in
all colonial administrations. Some are worse than
others, but in no case do we find a loyal attempt
to carry out the will of the people as constitu-
tionally expressed. All the governments seem to
be, more or less, artificial contrivances of foreign
origin for the purpose of outwitting the people and
securing the dominancy of the classes. This is
the fruitful source of all weakness. The spread
of education and the influence of a cheap press has
developed a knowledge of the principles of govern-
ment and an aptitude for polities among the
people, more complete and more widely diffused
than has ever before been known in the history of
the world; and there will never be strength in any
government that will not march with the people,
and that cannot make good its claim, on the
ground of superior ability, to occupy the position
of leadership. The form of government in each of
the provinces is that of a constitutional Demo-
cracy, and the people are continually and right-
fully striving to put their will on the statute-book,
whilst the governing class, grudgingly admitting
the theoretical right of the people to rule, are
using all the constitutional machinery of which
their superior knowledge gives them the com-
mand, to force their will upon the people. The
result is a continual fight between this govern-
ing class, having the control of the machinery
of government, and the great bulk of the
people, who have the constitutional right to
be the rulers, but who have not yet the knowledge
and experience to enable them to use their power
effectively, and make good their right.
• • •
From this cause arises the “ government by con-
tradiction,” to which you so frequently call atten-
tion in your columns; and that form of government
will continue, and the consequent vacillation and
uncertainty will continue, until those who have
hitherto monopolised power loyally accept the
will of the people as the supreme law, and lend
their aid to constitutionally give effect to it. It
is said that in the times of the Greeks there were
Oligarchies, the members of which were accus-
tomed to “ bind themselves by an oath to be evil-
minded to the people.” Ours do not bind them-
selves by an oath, but they are frequently bound
just as strongly by their class interests to be evil-
minded to the people. “The one abjectly and
incurably Tory Government in this continent,”
which you compare with the Democratic Govern-
ment of South Australia, is no true indication of
the state of political feeling in Queensland. A
few of the leading members of the progressive
party went over and joined hands with the Tories,
initiated a “revolution of reaction,” and suc-
ceeded in reversing in a couple of years the legisla-
tion of the previous seven. But that revolutionary
wave has already spent its force, and Queensland
now sees what it has led to, and is ready to accept
a government just as progressive as the last was
reactionary. So the see-saw goes on, to the
destruction of the peace and prosperity of the
provinces, and I, for one, can see no assurance of
anything better until the conflict between the
governments and the peoples is finished by the
complete adoption of the principle of the govern-
ment of the people, by the people, and for the
people. Then Australia will see governments
that are respected and feared ; strong for all good
purposes; and able to carry out great works in
the interest and for the benefit of the community.
• • *
This may seem to be a digression, but I wish to
emphasize my opinion that no scheme of federa-
tion emanating exclusively from the governing
class in Australia and tainted, as all such will
always be, with Imperialism, will ever command
that amount of popular support that is necessary
in these days to carry anything in politics to a
permanently successful issue. The successes of
the classes, won as they are too often by false
promises at elections, by violation of election
pledges afterwards, and by disingenuous half-
concessions to the democratic party, are feeble,
evanescent and very often the prelude to unex-
pected and almost revolutionary democratic
victories. The keynote of success in any attempt
to realise Federation in our time is, I think, trust
in the people. I, therefore, frankly accept the
position that the will of the people is the supreme
law in politics, and address myself to the con-
sideration of the means by which government of
the people could, in a constitutional manner, be
given effect to in the administration of that por-
tion of the affairs of Australia which cannot be
conveniently dealt with by the individual and
isolated provinces.
FEDERAL ASSEMBLY AND EXECUTIVE.
To obtain a fair and just representation of the
people of the federated provinces, I would pro-
pose that representatives be elected by universal
suffrage, and in the proportion of one representa-
tive to every 30,000 of the inhabitants (the quota
adopted in the Commonwealth Bill). That
would furnish an Assembly of 115 represen-
tatives to represent the 3J millions of persons
living in the five mainland provinces and in
Tasmania. (I have not included Maoriland.)
If that province came in the numbers would
approximate to 140 for four millions of people).
The only qualification in the suffrage should be in
the direction of requiring that the elector should
have resided for a certain time —say three or five
years—in Australia. The number excluded by
such a qualification would be very small, and no
hardship would, I think, be inflicted, seeing that
the disfranchisement would, in the case of any
person who had permanently settled, very quickly
cure itself. I suggest that the representatives
should be elected for three years, and that one-
third should retire annually. This would give a
truly representative body, possessing the element
of stability, and yet responsive to the develop-
ments of public opinion. The Executive might
consist of a certain number of the representatives,
according to convenience, chosen from the Assem-
bly ; I can see no advantage in a total separation
of the Executive from the Legislature. Both
Executive and Assembly would be presided over
by a Governor-General appointed by the Crown.
Having banished the idea of government by con-
tradiction, i.e., by a system of checks and balances
which only delay or prevent the carrying out of
the will of the people, there would be no need for
a costly and cumbersome Senate. The interests
of the individual provinces could be amply safe-
guarded by requiring that all measures should be
submitted a second time to the Assembly sitting
as a Senate, at which second sitting the repre-
sentatives would vote as provinces, the votes of a
majority of the representatives of any one pro-
vince being reckoned as the vote of that province.
This would give that protection of the rights of
individual provinces that is essential in any true
federal government.
FEDERAL STATE AND CAPITAL.
One of the chief stumbling-blocks in the way of
Federation hitherto has been the localisation of
the capital. That would be removed by constitut-
ing, as soon as might be after the federal body had
been formed, a new and separate Federal State to
be under the entire government and control of the
Federal Government. It should be in the interior,
and, as nearly as circumstances would permit,
equidistant from the capitals of the several pro-
vinces. There is room between E. lat. 26deg. and
30deg., and S. long. 140 deg. and 146 deg. to carve
out an inland State of any size up to 100,000
square miles. I should think that 50,000 square
miles would be a convenient size, being less than
the area of any present or contemplated province,
except Tasmania. The area I have mentioned
comprises a portion each of New South Wales,
South Australia, and Queensland, The country,
with the exception of the towns of Cunnamulla
and Thargomindah, is entirely under pastoral
occupation; and, as some of the pastoralists on the
Queensland side are now complaining that their
industry is not sufficiently profitable to enable
them to pay the very low rent collected by the
Queensland Government, they would probably
gladly accept moderate compensation for disturb-
ance if some portions of their runs should be
required for more profitable use. A federal
capital situated about equally distant from Bourke
and Oharleville would be fairly accessible from
Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Rock-
hampton, and Townsville, and, in point of dis-
tance, it would not be very much further from the
Gulf than from our Northern capital. With im-
provements in railway communication which
would instantly follow the adoption of such a
scheme, the journey from each of the capitals,
with the exception of Hobart and Perth, would
mean no more than one night on wheels, the
utmost achievement that can be hoped for in this
land of magnificent distances.
* * *
Let me here express the opinion that no legiti-
mate objection can be made to the locality
mentioned on the score of heat. The heat of
the interior, marvellous to relate, becomes less
and less with the progress of science and investi-
gation, and one is not over-rash in anticipating
the time when the warm, dry climate of the in-
terior will be more highly esteemed than the
cooler but moister regions on the sea-board.
Coghlan, speaking of Bourke, which almost
touches the 30th parallel, says;—“ Bourke has
the same latitude as Cairo, yet its mean summer
temperature is less, and its mean annual
temperature 4° less than is the case in the
Egyptian city. New Orleans also lies on the
same parallel, but the American city is 4° hotter
in summer. As regards winter temperature,
Bourke leaves little to be desired. The mean
winter reading of the thermometer is 54'5, and,
accompanied as this is by clear skies and an
absence of snow, the season is both refreshing and
enjoyable.” And, in this district, the supply of
artesian water is, according to present knowledge,
inexhaustible, the bore at Charleville (on the
border of the district indicated) yielding no less
than 3,000,000 gallons per day. With a scientific
system of water storage and distribution, there is
no reason why the country should not become a
perfect garden; and in the midst of it, in a climate
like that of Cairo and Thebes, would arise, as if
by magic, the Federal Metropolis of Australia, a
city of stone and marble, beautiful to the eye, and
more enduring than any city built upon the sea-
board.
» # #
The representation in the Federal Assembly
being established on a population basis, the sea-
board provinces would be stimulated to friendly
rivalry, seeing that every increase of population
would mean a corresponding increase in their
representation and importance in the Federal
Legislature. This rivalry would, however, be
guarded against abuse by federal laws against in-
dented labour and other forms of artificial immi-
gration. Under fair conditions, each province
would be worthily engaged in making its territory
as attractive as possible to all classes. In case io
should be urged that the best men in the coast
provinces would not be willing to give their ser-
vices as representatives in an interior State, I
reply that the best men are those who will give
their services. Let it always be insisted upon
that the interests of the State are of more im-
portance than the interests of any individual in
the State. I think that Australia has in the past
rather lost than gained in accepting the services
of those who can only devote the odds and ends of
their time to public duties, and that it would be a
good thing to insert in any future federal consti-
tution a clause requiring that the sittings of the
Assembly shall begin at 10 a.m. and conclude, if
not sooner, at 4 p.m. This would ensure to the
service of the State the best hours of the day, and
for the remainder legislators need have no diffi-
culty in finding useful employment. The states-
man does not live, certainly not in Australia, who
can truthfully say that his education is complete.
FEDERAL REVENUE.
The Federal Government would at the outset
collect the Customs duties, and, I think, by its
own officers. This would mean a revenue of 7h
millions, but as at first the Federal Government
would probably not be charged with any functions
involving a large expenditure, a very large
portion of it would be returned to the provincial
Governments. Regarding, as I do, the benefits of
Federation as being shared equally by each of the
provinces, the expense of the Federal body should
be contributed on a population basis. The surplus
remaining after deducting the expenditure of the
Federal Government would, therefore, be returned
to the province exactly according to the rate per
head of the Customs taxation in that province, less
its proportion, on a population basis, of the federal
expenditure. As it is generally allowed that the
appointment of a Governor-General would render
the retention of separate Governors in each of the
provinces unnecessary, and as the duties dis-
charged by the Federal Government would from
the first relieve the provinces of a considerable
amount of expenditure, it is probable that the
total cost of government over the whole of Aus-
tralia would not, even at the outset, be increased
to any considerable extent, if at all. Should there
be any deficiency in provincial revenue, owing to
the expense of Federal Government, it would have
to be made up by direct taxation ; and the pro-
vincial governments have in wealth, especially the
wealth of absentees, a source of taxation which,
up to the present time, has hardly been tapped.
FEDERAL DUTIES.
In spite of all the animosity that has been
evinced, from time to time, against the defence
forces of the various provinces, I still hold to my
opinion that national defence is the first duty
of the individual citizen and the first duty
of the State. Perhaps the want of apprecia-
tion of the need of defence on the part of the
people at large may be regarded as an evi-
dence that they do nob value at a very high
rate the advantages they enjoy in our present
imperfect state of civilisation. All the same,
there is even in our lowest depths a lower deep to
which we might fall, and we have always, so long
as we maintain our national integrity, the bright
prospect of being able to rise to higher levels of
prosperity where we should have cause to set a
very high rate on our privileges. Given a con-
stitution which shall open to all free access to the
sources of wealth and power, and bring the advan-
tages of civilisation and invention within the
reach of all, and Australia will never want for
defenders. “That public virtue which, among
the ancients, was denominated patriotism is
derived from a strong sense of our own interest in
the preservation and prosperity of the free govern-
ment of which we are members.” The duty of
national defence has already been, to a certain
•extent, relegated to the Federal Council, and
there would probably be no difficulty in placing
the whole system in the hands of a Federal
Government. The majority of the provinces have
also already shown a desire to take concerted
action in the direction of excluding coloured and
other alien races from Australia, and there can be
no doubt that the vast majority of the people of
•every province would be strongly in favour of
united action. Assimilation of Customs tariffs, and
regulation of excise and bounties, with a view to
the establishment of absolute Freetrade through-
out Australia, present greater difficulties, but
none that need be regarded as insuperable,
* * 9
Other matters of Federal concern—the pooling of
our debts, union of railway systems, Federal Court
of Appeal, post and telegraphs, currency, and land
laws could be entrusted to the Federal body as
unanimity between the various provinces, and
•consequent confidence in the central body, was
obtained, I think that the establishment of a
university, with agricultural college, military
college and school of mines attached should also
be entrusted to the Federal Government. Pro-
fessors of the highest attainments should there be
found to train the sons of Australia in the in-
dustrial arts, and instructors to teach their
“hands to war and their fingers to fight,” if the
occasion should ever arise, in defence of their
homes and liberties. The home of the Federal
Government should be also the seat of learning
and the centre of defence. And here, secure in its
remoteness from all foes, would be a splendid field
for the most exalted experiments in sociology.
The land, reserved from the first as the inalien-
able heritage of all, would be the great federal
asset, and, as the population increased, the
revenues derived from the use and occupation of
the land could be devoted to the adornment of the
city, and to the comfort and convenience of the
citizens. Co-operation, both distributive and
productive, with or without State control, could
be tried on a scale sufficiently large to test the
practicability of a complete system of collectivism;
and, out of the abundance of the revenue derived
from land values, free railways and tramways, and
free post and telegraph services might possibly be
maintained. Prohibition might be given a fair
trial, and I am one of those who think—in spite of
the failure at Mildura—that once established as
the law of a virgin State, it would remain law for
ever, and by the contagion of example would
gradually spread to the other provinces, until it
became the law of Australia.
» * »
I do not disguise from myself that the ideal
which I have sketched will prove exceedingly
repulsive to the average politician, and to the
selfish individualist, tinder cover of the parrot
cry of impracticability will be arrayed against it
the opposition of the leading politicians, ever
hungering after the ginger-bread of Imperialism ;
of the coast trader, anxious for profits arising
from his trade relations with foreign mercantile
houses; of the property owner, always thinking
of magnifying his own town and province by cut-
throat competition with his neighbours ; of the
fossil Tory every where with his first principle of
“mistrust of the people tempered by fear;” and
of the whole tribe of land speculators and jobbers
who can see good in nothing that does not hold
forth the prospect of traffic in unearned incre-
ment. It is waste of time to attempt to conciliate
where opposition is certain. As the sun of Aus-
tralian Unity arises in its splendour the shadows
of Imperialism and absenteeism that have so long
rested on these fair provinces will be dispersed;
the passion for Australia will cast out the passion
for Europe; and we shall raise our eyes to our
own bright future, and wonder why we, like the
man with the muck-rake, have so long foreborne to
look up and realise the glorious possibilities of
this our country.
THE FIRST PRACTICAL STEP.
How can we move towards this ideal ? I think
the course is clear. In the Federal Council, now
existing in a feeble, apologetic way, we have a
body expressly designed for the purpose of paving
the way for a Federation. The preamble of the
Act declares that the Council is constituted “for
the purpose of dealing with such matters of com-
mon Australasian interest, in respect to which
united action is desirable, as can be dealt with
without unduly interfering with the management
of the internal affairs of the several colonies by
their respective legislatures.” It has been a
pretty poor thing so far, because it has consisted
only of self-appointed politicians with a liking for
an occasional picnic, but let the breath of the re-
presentative principle be breathed into its nostrils
and I believe the Council may yet become a living
organism endowed with great potentialities for
good. Under the amendment proposed last year
and assented to, I think, by all the provinces that
have taken part in the proceedings of the Council
hitherto, the number of representatives is increased
to five for each province. The suggestion I would
make is that New South Wales, abandoning her
policy of isolation, come into the Council and
send down five members elected by universal
suffrage. To form an estimate of the enor-
mous preponderance of weight that five mem-
bers representing over a million of people
would possess over the nominees of the other
provinces representing only themselves, we have
but to observe the weight that an elected Assem-
bly has over a nominee Council, even when, under
the letter of the Constitution, the powers of each
are equal. The other colonies would be bound at
once to strengthen their representation by the
same means, with the result that we should have a
body of 30 men, representing three and a-half
millions of people, meeting together actually
charged with the duty of finding means of dealing
efficiently with those matters which belong to the
peace and welfare of Australasia. New South
Wales would have the honour of having set the
pace; none of the other provinces would dare to
stop short; and the first great stride will have
been taken towards the achievement of Demo-
cratic Federation.

A Fool and His Knowledge!
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Twelve two-quart bottles ! Six gallons
among a score of them! How long will it take
them to get outside that lot, sir ?”
“ Twenty-eight—nine—-thirty,” concluded the
skipper, counting shark’s-fin bundles. “Oh ! —the
arrack ? Six hours or so. Won’t be a drop left
to-morrow morning.” The old man’s lemon-
skinned countenance crinkled into a thousand
wrinkles at the mate’s astonishment. “That
makes you sit up, don’t it ?”
Hinohcliffe was a fin-de-si&cle sailor, given to
savings-banks and mariners’ churches, and ignorant
altogether of the sublimer altitudes of drunken-
ness.
“More’n a quart a-piece,” he said. “No
offence, Captain Spragg, but I don’t believe it.”
“ You’d believe stranger things than that,
young man, if you’d been nigh a score of years
run.nin’ to the Malawatties, like me. Turn to,
anyhow, and get this stuff below, and then you
can go ashore and take a lesson in boozin’ from
your black brother. The village is over that first
hill— hardly a mi,le away.”
Hincholiffe sent the stuff below —got on deck,
for the next comers, the arrack and tobacco, the
guns and knives, the Celebes-cloth, handkerchiefs
and looking-glasses—then he said he was ready.
Spragg reflectively chewed his enormous thumb.
“On second thoughts,” he said, “no! These
chaps is harmless enough, if you know their ways ;
but you’re a green hand among ’em, and the
liquor’s bound to set ’em clapper-clawin’ before
raornin’.”
The young fellow laughed. “That’s all right,
captain; I’ll keep out of mischief.”
“ You certainly will, this turn, young man—
’oause you won’t get the chance of runnin’ into it.
Stay on board ! ”
Most men have an ultimative gesture. Spragg’s
was a shift of his hat, and the mate, seeing him
box the compass now with his ancient Panama,
knew that more words would be wasted. But
Hinchclitfe’s “green” was not of the soft variety.
He looked across at the spikes of ruddy lime-
stone, rising from slopes of forest margined
only from the purple of the sea by the
shining strip of coralline sand and the snowy
line of surf. “ Ashore Igo this day !” he said to
himself, “if I have to swim for it. If the old
man don’t like it he can do the other thing. I
know how to bring him up with a round turn —as
green as he thinks me !”
# • »
“ Hincholiffe ! Where the Beelzebub is
Mr. Hinohcliffe?”
Spragg’s bull-voice brought an echo from the
shore, and Stumpy Grogan, compendious seoond-
mate and boatswain, bellowed in reply, “If he
ain’t aft he ain’t forrard—ain’t in the bloomin’
hooker !”
“That be blowed for a ” Spragg broke off,
walked to the taffrail, and looked over. The
dingy was gone
The skipper’s wrath was all the greater in that
he gave it no words. For a minute or so he
studied the deck-seams, then he sent his eye aloft,
swept it slowly down the heavens, and fixed it in
the south-east. Low down in that quarter a level
bank of copper-coloured cloud was blackening, by
contrast, the cobalt of the sea beneath it, throw-
ing also into the pellucid blue above a taint of
hard and ominous green.
Spragg jerked his thumb towards the change.
“ What d’ye make of that, Grogan?”
“Hard from sou’-east, sir.’’
“ Pho! I know that, man. How long, first, I
mean ? ”
“We’ll have it by sundown—if not sooner.
And—you’ll ’souse me, Cap’en Spragg—but this is
a cussed ugly place to be in when it chops to the
eastward—as it’s safe to do !”
Spragg knew all that, too. And the Rommany
Lass was nearly full ship—shell, trepang, birds’-
nests, and sharks’-fins. “ Rot the young fool! ’’
he broke out. “ I s’pose I’ll have to go after him.
Get that quarter-boat over—sharp, now! And,
lookee here, Grogan—while I’m away, heave her
short to her anchor, get the hatches over, and see
all snug to cut-an’-run with the first of it,”
Grogan cast a discontented eye after the lessen-
ing boat. “All d—d fine!” he growled; “but
this makes us four hands short, out of nine.
Lovely fix we’ll be in if we get that dirt down on
us before he comes off again.”

Hinchcliffe — pleased as a schoolboy to have
got ashore unnoticed —hauled the dingy up on the
sand, found the track, and started for the village.
But he hadn’t done a quarter of the distance
when, doubling suddenly round a rocky angle, he
found himself face to face with something so little
removed from beauty that—“good” young man
as he was—he sought to go no further. The young
lady, clad only in a bark-petticoat and innocence,
might have been fourteen, looked like twenty,
and was clearly not pure Malawatty. Her skin
was a light-brown, her hair a lighter, and her
laugh was a laugh—not the face-bisecting Papuan
grin. A middling Malay she spoke, too, with
here and there, as a tour-de-force, a word of quite
intelligible English. With one of these she
answered, when Hinchcliffe at last succeeded in
making her understand a thing that puzzled him.
She had a faint resemblance —which he couldn’t
place—to somebody be knew. “ Fader!” the girl
said, pointing to her face and waving her hand to
seaward, and the man, uncomprehending, turned,
just in time—as it happened—to see her father,
for Spragg, in the act of doubling round the rook,
bore in his rugged phiz the link to Hinchcliffe’s
disjointed recollection. And Spragg, himself,
seeing that the other saw, lost nothing of hia
sullen anger for the knowledge.
“ Aboard with you !” he growled. “ We’re off
to-night, and ’twould have served you dam-well
right to’ve left you behind—you sneakin’ young
hound 1”
“ Don’t excite yourself, captain !” And Hinch-
cliffe —provokingly cool himself —pointed to the
brown girl, staring at her angry parent. “I’ve
got to say good-bye to —Miss Spragg, isn’t it ?
Wonder what the other Miss Spraggs would say ?
—at home in Singapore ! And Mrs. S. ! Ob,
what a sly old rooster it is !”
The elder man stepped forward, with a glare
that made the dusky damsel draw back with quite
a civilised squeak. But Hinchcliffe stood his
ground—laughing.
“ Don’t be a fool, old Blowhard ! I'm not one,
at all events, and I know all about the little
oracles you’ve been working on your owners! So,
mind your helm, old cock ! —if you don’t want to
be fixed up, when we get back, over that business
—to say nothing of this !” He patted the girl on
the shoulder. “ Oh, he’s off !—is he ? Give us a
kiss, my dear !—I must catch up with your worthy
progenitor—unless I want to stay with you alto-
gether.”
Spragg, striding furiously down the darkening
track, heard the other behind him—and made up
his mind. In Hinchcliffe—as this new light
showed him—was a danger that must be got rid
of. The skipper stopped short, and waited till the
mate came breathlessly up. Then calmly—almost
pleasantly—said the elder man :
“So, my lad—my daughter’s a fine girl-you
seem to think !”
“She’s all that, captain !” said the astounded
Hinchcliffe. “ Pity we can’t take her with us ! ’
“ Ay!” and Spragg stepped nearer in the
gathering gloom. “It’s a pity, as you say. But
then, you see, you can stay with her !—d n
you ! —you can stay with her!” —and, like a
cannon-ball, his huge fist took Hinchcliffe in the
jaw, and laid him, limp and motionless, amongst
the tiger-ferns.
• • •
Couldn’t drop across him ! ” the skipper
said. “On his own head be it —we daren’t hang on
here any longer. Shove off—and pull like blazes!”
The surf was rising in their teeth already, but
with a wetting they got through, and, with the
dingy in tow, pulled plunging out to where the
Rommany Lass, with her head-sails thundering
loose, was snatching viciously at her up-and-down
cable. Then again the windlass clanked, till
Hinchcliffe—dazed and dizzy—caught the familiar
sound. “Good God!” he cried, and rushed
stumbling down to the beach. The schooner’s
canvas was a loosening smudge upon the last of
daylight.
He was left 1
• • •
“ Went ashore against my orders ! ”
Spragg told his owners. “ And it came on heavy
an’ sudden from the sou’-east. And I had to get
the schooner off-shore before it hauled round to
the east’ard. Which it did before mornin’, and
kept there—a gale an’ a-half—for three solid days.
And then we was well abreast of Sumbawa.”
“Dear me!” said the smooth-shaven senior
partner. “And that, Captain Spragg, was how
far to the westward ?”
“Six hundred miles, gentlemen—every yard of
it!”
“ Dear me! dear me ! So, you see, Mr. Hinoh-
cliffe, there was absolutely no help for it. It was,
if I may say so, the—ah !—the finger of Gawd !”
With which story old Hinchcliffe had to rest
content, until—years after the veracious Spragg
was comfortably ensconced in Davy Jones’ locker—
a half-savage white man, who had been picked up
at the Malawatties—and who was Francis Hinch-
cliffe—brought with him to Singapore the version
which—taken with reasonable salt, and elucidated
by William Grogan, mariner—has been herein-
before presented.
ALEX. MONTGOMERY.
Melbournian ; Barter replaces money. In
a shop-window I read, “Anything exchanged for
a few good fowls.”
Zox’s latest Hebrew yarn, A sickly son
of Israel, diagnosed as suffering from stone, was
told he would have to rest a week before opera-

vait a veek—it might be a diamond !”
Of Robert Rand, the celebrated N.S.W.
squatter, lately deceased, a correspondent writes
from Queensland to The Bulletin “ Rand was
a remarkable man anart altogether from his being
reputedly a very rich one. An Irishman; well
educated; well-read in every sense, and up to
date. Piles of British newspapers and magazines
littered his modest home at Mohonga on the
Billabong, some 50 miles from Albury. Short in
stature, pale-red or fair-haired, bright ‘lrish’ blue
eyes, ruddy complexion, abrupt, nay, ‘brusque’
in his manner. Robert Rand, although dubbed a
miser and a woman-hater, was, I think, misunder-
stood by many of those who were his neighbours
and thought themselves his intimate friends.
Morgan, the bushranger, haunted the country
round Mohonga during his career; his head-
quarters being near Piney Range, Walbundra, and
Walla Walla, all near Mohonga. It was currently
believed that Morgan made Rand dance naked on
a table at Mohonga after ‘ bailing up ’ the station
Rand absolutely denied the truth of this to me
but stated that Morgan threatened to shoot him
unless he did so, and afterwards took blackmail
instead. The great unemployed in Morgan’s days
roved about Riverina, and to my knowledge
towards shearing ’69-70 (circum) Rand fed ‘travel-
lers,’ as the bush-workers were styled then in that
part. lam writing by the book when I state that
two bags of flour were served out in my presence
(two pannikins, or say 21bs. to each man and a
good piece of meat), every night at sundown.
Not much of the miser so far! I managed a station
adjoining Rand’s. One of the sheep-paddocks
on my run adjoined his; but was not used by me
because a gold reef was found there, and the rush
fizzled out in a few months. When the field was
deserted I happened to be in that paddock, and
curiously looked at the quartz stacked at the mouths
of the shafts. I thus accidentally found that most
of the shafts, or holes, were filled up with dead
sheep. They belonged to Rand, and fell in
while licking saline deposits. No mistaking
them. He at that time never docked the sheeps’
tails, holding that the tail wool paid for the shear-
ing. (He, for reasons apparent to sheep-breeders
found the tail business a loss.) Well, I sent a
boundary-rider to him with a letter next day
apprising him of the sheep disaster, and I heard
no more of the matter for a long time,
till I was Rand’s guest for a night at Mohonga!
He then told me that when he got my letter about
the sheep, Dr. M'Alroy, R.C. Vicar-General,
Albury, was his guest for the night. After dinner
the priest, seeing Rand open and read my letter,
thought it a good opening and inquired— ‘ By the
way, have you any of my flock in your service ? If
so, I would like to see them while you peruse your
letter.’ Rand, whose thoughts were then engaged
on his woolly flocks, absent-mindedly asked—
What brand have they got ? ’ A bald yarn on
paper, but you would have enjoyed it, especially
with Rand’s hearty laugh. He could laugh. Did
you ever know a miserly man, or narrow-minded
man, laugh heartily ? A laugh that did him and
his listener good. The coldest morning at
Mohonga saw Rand go to the billabong or dam
for a bath. A ‘ clean ’ living, intelligent, liberal-
minded man, of retiring, self-sufficient habit of
mind and conduct. I heartily wish the sturdy old
squatter a sound sleep.”
