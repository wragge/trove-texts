BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.’’
These are. undoubtedly; days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying- influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few—the more
sroieal among us —can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
A Beautiful Complexion by Natural Means. —
Tlie secret of a perfect complexion lies in the
continual renewing of the outer cuticle of the
skin. This is Nature's own method. The
outer skin as it becomes coarse or shrivelled
must he removed, and an opportunity given
to the finer one beneath to show itself. It is
because the old, dead skin is allowed to re-
main on the face that so many women, and
even young girls, suffer from pimples,
blotches and sallow dull skins. To remove, by
absorption, the dead outer skin, and with it
all blemishes, the use of mercolized wax is
universally recommended. ordinary face
creams being powerless for this purpose.
Smear the wax over the face and neck, rub it
gently into the skin, and leave it on all night.
In the morning wash it off. using Pilenta
soap and warm water, when all the dead skin
will be removed with the wax. Then apply a
lotion to prevent any trace of greasiness
being noticeable and to give a peach-like
bloom to the skin. A lotion to do this can be
made up quite cheaply from the following
recipe: Take one ounce of cleminite and dis-
solve it in four tablespoonfuls of hot water.
Place in a bottle, and when cool apply to the
face with the fingertips, allowing it to dry on
the skin.
To Remove Blackheads.—Dissolve one effer-
vescing sfyniol (ablet in n glass of hot water
allow the effervescence to subside, then dip a
small sponge into the liquid and mop over the
face. Allow it to remain on for a few min
utes, then wipe off with a towel, and the
blackheads will be entirely removed. To pre-
vent them from re-appearing, use a stvmol
tablet in the manner described twice a week.
How to Sham poo.--Before shampooing the
hair dip the fingers into a little pure olive or
almond oil, and thoroughly massage the scalp.
Then dissolve a teaspoonful of stallax granules
in a cup of hot water. Fill a basin with warm
water into which the ends of the hair can
fall, and shampoo the stallax mixture into the
roots in the usual way. Then rinse and dry
by fanning witli a palm fan.
<>rey Hair. —To restore the color of grey or
fading hair, take two ounces' of concentrated
taminalite, and mix it with three ounces of
hay rum; apply to the hair for several nights,
using a small sponge, and the hair will grad-
ually resume its original color. When the
desired shade has been obtained, the tamma-
lite lotion should be used about twice a week.
Apply it to the roots with an old toothbrush.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
TO WHITEN* A BROWN NECK (W.K.).—To
whiten your neck, use jettaline. Get a tube
of this from the chemist and rub a little well
into the skin of the neck; leave it on till next
morning. Do this regularly every night for
three or four weeks, and you will find that
the skin will become beautifully clear and
white.
BABY.—You need not lose your pretty com-
plexion. Get a tin of mercolized wax, and
rub a little well into the face every night.
This well remove the dead outer skin and
reveal the pretty fresh new skin underneath.
Be careful what soap you use. as this is very
important. I should suggest Pilenta.
MATER.—To reduce yourself to your original
weight, get a packet of clynol berries and eat
four daily, one after each meal and one at
bedtime. When once you have returned to
your normal weight you can discontinue
them, as the cure is permanent and not merely
temporary, as so many others are. There is
no need to make any alteration in your diet.
DISAPPOINTED. —I am not surprised that
you have been disappointed in your hair: you
are not using a suitable shampoo. (Jet a
packet of stallax and shampoo the hair every
fortnight with this, it will make it soft and
keep it fair.
NELLIE.—There is nothing more disastrous
to beauty than superfluous hair. Iu that you
are right, but you are wrong iu thinking that
there is no permanent cure. Get an ounce of
powdered pheminol and a tube of tekko paste.
These two, used in conjunction, will perma-
nently remove five growth.
GERTIE.—The lotion to which you refer is
made as follows: Get an ounce of cleminite
and mix it with four ounces of warm water.
Allow it to cool, bottle, and dab over the face,
allowing it to dry on the skin. This is far
superior to powder, and gives a fresh bloom
to the face without the appearance of make up.
MARGE. Yes. the longer your eyelashes the
larger and brighter your eyes will look. To
increase the growth of the lashes rub a little
mennaline into the roots every night. Do this
very gently, but thoroughly, and you will be
delighted with the result. [t

THE HAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There were five red cherries around the brim,
And a ribbon was threading the grass-green crown,
My eyes grew bright that with tears were dim,
And my heart ran up that last week ran down.
So I bought the hat with its cherries red,
Fitting it trimly upon my head,
While tile street ran riot in warm sunlight.
There were five red cherries around the brim,
And a wisp of ribbon was threading them through.
Would I break my heart for the likes of him,
When a hat like that means a sweetheart new? —-
For you flutter your lids and shyly smile,
Undo and button your gloves the while,
And stand like a fawn half-poised for flight.
’Twas myself looked him up, and looked him down,
As he came to me, with a toss of my head,
Till the cherries rattled against the crown,
But the minute he smiled the anger fled.
“Sure, now I know there is Spring in the land,
Cirl of my heart, try to understand
The dark of my world for this past fortnight!"
There are five red cheri'ies around the brim,
And a ribbon is threading the grass-green crown —
Och, the fairies gave it. that twist and trim
With the grass that grows upon Knochmcaldown !

A Socialist’s Confessions
In Reminisceapes and Reflections of a Mid-
l ictorian (George Allen and Unwin Ltd..
London) Ernest Bedford Bax, for half a cen-
tury or so one of the best-known English
Socialists, gossips through a dozen chapters
about men and affairs and himself and the
changes he has noticed in society and
thought. Probably liis gossiping will have
historical value. Its contemporary interest is
limited—to an Australian reader very much
so, mainly because most of what Bax has to
saj has been said before, and partly because
his style is rather heavy for work of this
kind. Gossiping is a special gift, and Bax
has not got it. He is nbt intimate enough.
He suppresses himself too much. As transla-
tor of and commentator on Kant and
Schopenhauer, tin l author of an exhaustive
critical examination of certain phrases of the
Reformation period in Central Europe and
the writer of the “Religion of Socialism”
and “The Roots of Reality," Bax was on his
own ground, so to speak. He is a philoso-
pher first and last, and philosophy blends
indifferently with gossip. Of his thorough-
going Socialism there is no doubt. He was
one of the founders of the Social Democratic
Federation, and has remained strong in the
mith and in tile closest association with
British and European Socialists, from Engles
and Bebel to Morris and Ilyndman and
Jaures and Karl Lisbnecht. And because of
this—well, listen to him on a subject which
a lot of men in Australia who call-themselves
Socialists are fond of addressing the congre-
gation about:—
In dealing with the war every Socialist is natu-
lally brought up against the fact of the treachery
to the fundamental principles of Socialism, as well
as to international party ties, on the part of the
Social Democratic members of the Reichstag. When
consider that but a few days before the outbreak
of the war, both at the meeting of the International
bociiilist Bureau at Brussels on the part of
certain of the leaders at least, a day or two subse-
quently in Paris, the strongest assurances were
given by members of the present majority of the
Reichstag fraction that the German proletariat would
never consent to fight their French brethren and
that the party members in the Reichstag would never
vote war credits for the Government—when we con-
sider this, the action of these very same men and
of the colleagues in whose name they spoke, scarcely
more than a week later, must constrain the mildest
and most indulgent critic to admit that history can
hardly show a baser and a viler instance of treachery
and broken pledges than their conduct.
Let us have a conference with them, eh?
Well, Bax again :
One thing is certain —that outside Germany no
one calling himself a Socialist should consent again
to meet in congress or to hold any intercourse what-
soever either directly or indirectly with traitors to
the principles of Socialism, to the International
Socialist party and to Humanity, such as the
majority of the present representation of the Social
Democratic Party in the German Reichstag.
This man is no fiagwagger—no believer in
that queer combination of ignorance and
truculence so often called patriotism. Nor
is he even a Nationalist. But—
There is an element in the psychology of the
ultra pacifist British Socialist which must’ not be
lost sight of. It is the acute anti-patriotic bias
which reduces political and ethical judgments to an
absurdity. The bias implies that because Britain
happens, to be on a particular side that side must
necessarily be in the wrong and the enemy in the
right... precisely the same moral principles which led
men to execrate the action of Britain in the Boer war
ought to lead them to execrate the action of Ger-
many in the present war. To allow one’s anti-
patriotic bias to run so wild as to kick over all
the bounds of ethics -political logic seems scarcely
compatible with a sane mind. Yet so it is. In
addition to this, of course, certain well-known fal-
lacies play their part as, for example, the obsession
alluded to by Mill—that there must be always faults
on both sides, an obsession which blinds a man to
truth and justice when it is to be found on one
side only, as it very often is The Allied Powers
may have all the evil qualities in their Governmental
institutions that Socialist criticism ascribes to
them and yet they may be wholly in the right as
regards the specific issue of this war. The distinction is
recognised in common life. The most strenuous
advocate of the Nonconformist conscience would not
trip up a policeman chasing a burglar on the ground
that the policeman was a person of immoral life.
In the early days of the Social Democratic
Federation Bax saw much of a man later to
be heard of in Australia. Personally he
found him “by no means a bad sort.” Other-
wise :
. H. 11.. Champion had a short incisive manner with
him which undoubtedly impressed those with whom
he came in contact. He was an effective speaker
with many audiences. At first a devoted adherent
of Ilyndman, he seemed always possessed, as Ilynd-
man himself put it, with an impatience to make
12 o’clock at 11. This temperament of his caused
him, after a few years, to tire of the slow and
more or less monotonous business of agitating and
organising in the interests of Socialism, a kind
of labor for which he possessed undoubted abilitv.
Instead of continuing the work to which he had
put his hand, after his first enthusiasm had spent
itself, he developed a tendency for political intrigue,
with a view, as he in all probability sincerely
thought, of obtaining immediate results in the
improvement of the condition of the working classes.

Hudson Motor-Cars arc Built for Supreme Endurance
ST is more important now than ever that the motor-car buyer select an automobile of proved
quality. He must be certain that his car can be depended upon for performance and
endurance. Its reliability must be unquestioned.
Hudson Super-Sixes are reliable. The owners’ records of over 50,000 in service demon-
strate that. A Hudson owner starts on a journev with a feeling of securitv, with the knowledo-e
that he can travel to his destination and back with freedom from mechanical troubles and with the
assurance that the Hudson will take him anywhere that motor-cars can go. Hudson records for
power, hill-climbing ability and road endurance prove-that.
In every country on the globe where motor-cars are sold to-day you will find a Hudson dealer.
This is the new jour-

The Law.
Red, blood-red feathers lying on the road.
But the sky-ways keep no stain
Of loss or bitter gain—
Of the grim toll of Pain,
Only red feathers lying on the road
Remain !
Nature her olden cruel secret keeps;
Grey earth and brooding sky,
And old winds keening cry,
Like an eternal “Why?”—
While trembling life travailing creeps
To die!
Poor blood-red feathers lying on the road,
Mute witness of the Law
That nerved the tiger’s claw,
That fanged the grey wolfs jaw,
And drives blind Europe groaning neath a
goad
Blood-raw!
Poor soft red feathers lying in the dust,
In your bright span of days
Gave ye due need of praise
To that which smiles and slays
And holds its smiling and its slaying just—
Always.
VICTORIA.
MARIE E. J. PITT.
The Master-Player.
I sought for a theme, seeking hither and
thither,
But ever and ever I failed in my quest;
No lark springing up from his tuft of red
heather
Was I, with the song lying stilled in my
breast.
Came Love with his Cupids to laugh at my
fancy,
To cheat and elude the slow grasp of my
mind ;
Came the scent of the rose and the hue ol
the pansy,
And the gold of the sycamore blown on the
wind.
Alas, though the tints of the autumn were
tender,
Recalling the Past with its rue and its rose,
Came Memory wearing no garland of splen-
dor,
Her retinue robed in the drabbest of prose.
And, to and fro pacing, the trodden boards
creaking,
I quested the highways and byways of
thought;
As one who goes seeking, and ever goes
seeking,
Red gold hid away by the Fairies, I sought.
And then, the house quitting, I sped to the
forest,
And met a musician of marvellous skill;
The little leaves lisped, and the mighty trees
chorused,
And never a moment his music was still.
And all through the music I hearkened him
saying.
What time the red leaves danced about him
and swirled :
“Come, sit at my keyboard, and learn from
my playing
The song-themes that thrill through the soul
of the world.”
“And what is your music?” I questioned him,
sighing,
For wild was its sounding, yet sweet ever-
more.
“At times ’tis the wind through the forest-
leaves flying;
At times ’tis the breaking of waves on the
shore!”
“And what is your music, more sweet than
the daughters
Of men voicing love, ’neath love’s wonderful
thrall?”
“At times ’tis the clamor of many wild
waters;
At times the low note of a lone waterfall.”
“And what is your music?” I questioned him,
thrilling
To taste the strange sweetness that dwelt in
his lore.
“At times ’tis a single cicada’s lone shrill-
ing;
At times ’tis the voice of a thousand and
more!”
He sat at the keyboard, and lo! at the
motion
Of fingers that moved on the answering keys,
Earth music responded, the hymn of the
ocean,
The chant of the waters, the song of the
trees.
I sought for a theme, searching hither and
thither
The highways and byways where singing-
men roam,
And found it at last where the trees sing
together.
And all the Four Winds of the world have
their home.
N.SAV.
RODERIC QUINN.
Youth Passes.
The harp of life struck by the hand
Of Youth gives forth a hundred songs-.
For ail the rapture in the land,
To Youth by right belongs.
Then Love weaves all the whispering notes
Into the vibrant wonder chord.
On seas of joyous pain Youth floats
Its heart pierced by a sword.
Submerged, to its harp raft it clings.
When Love, in mockery, is fled,
And in Time’s shallows mends the' strings—
The little songs all dead.

NO FAITH NEED BE KEPT WITH
HERETICS.
Those plausible individuals who talk about
an appeal to the Hun people to discuss peace
terms as reasonable beings, and speak as if
there was any appreciable Hun people apart
from the ruling and military caste to discuss
anything with, are a source of weariness.
Most of them are probably just folk who
acquired their ideas in the twopenny politics
of villages and small municipal councils and
local trades-unions, and they reason from
these small things because they don’t know
that big things exist. A few possibly know
that big things exist, but are paid in one
way or another to disguise the fact. The
position is that no one can open negotiations
with an octopus unless he negotiates with
the whole octopus. It is useless to say that
one of the feelers is a kindly and rational
affair and appeal to it to disown the head of
the animal, for it has no separate existence.
The Hun became One Big Union more than
200 years ago, and his recent advances have
been rapid. It was as far back as 1859 that
the then Regent of Prussia —the present
Kaiser’s grandfather—declared that “hence-
forth the Prussian army is the nation in
arms.” And it had been the nation in arms
long before that date. In addition, it is the
nation in the public service and the nation
in the ranks of the nobility, or hoping to get
into the said ranks. There are 22 ruling
families in the Hun empire each with a court
and with oflices, decorations and titles of
nobility to dispose of. If there were IS
George V.’s in the British Isles, that would
be about the same thing in point of popula-
tion. The hereditary distinctions range from
a billet as prince down to that of a heredi-
tary purveyor of some simple article of
clothing. (This is quite apart from distinc-
tions which are not hereditary, ranging from
the Black Eagle or the Order of Hubert.
which are rare, to the iron cross, which
almost every soldier gets in war-time, j Every
title is accompanied by an heirloom in the
shape of a signed and sealed and decorated
patent of nobility. Every title is a direct
link with the sovereign in a land where the
boss sovereign is still taken seriously
as ah agent and representative and almost
btothft'J' Of “Goit.” Every title lifts the
owner, in the opinion of a race where every
man is a snob, above the man below. And
every title is a step towards something
higher provided the stepper keeps on good
terms with the fount of honor. There are 22
founts.
The system would die of ridicule if half
the population was made a count or a duke.
But the vast and intricate gradations save
it. In Britain the five orders of the peerage
are to a great extent the bulwarks of the
monarchical idea. The idea would be stronger
still if the British monarchy hadn’t been
disrupted by revolutions and usurpations—if
Bichard 11. and Henry VI. and Kiciiard
118 and James 11. hadn’t been violently
shifted to make room for new aspirants, and
Charles I. hadn’t lost his disrespected head,
and there hadn’t been a Commonwealth and
a Republic, and strange sovereigns hadn’t
been brought in from Wales and Scotland
and Holland and Hanover, and the people
hadn’t enjoyed intermittent chances at con-
stitution-making which the Prussians never
had. And supposing the British sovereigns
had retained direct control of the army and
preserved the habit of military leadership,
the Crown of J. Bull’s country might be an
overwhelming tradition and one that was
universally accepted. George V., aided and
abetted by, say, 17 under-kings, might then
run 125 orders of carefully-graded nobility,
and marshal them all, down to the C.iu.
and the "Esq.” and the recognised purveyor
and the high-born civil-service clerk and the
honorable station-master, into a solid army
of superior beings all looking up to himself
and looking down on their inferiors. He
would have so many bulwarks that, thanks
to their numbers and organisation, the out-
siders wouldn’t matter much. In fact the
only outsiders that would count would be
those who were so incurably extraneous that
they had no hope of being anything better.
George Y. would have even more to rely
upon, supposing Britain were Germany, than
the direct nobility, though it included, in a
wa y, the honorable station-master.
I lie O’Briens, O’Connors, O’Neills, Camp-
bells, Macdonalds, and such would be a
caste apart, specially recognised by the sov-
ereign as descendants of old feudal fighting
families with special organisations. The clan
Organisation might be dead, but the clan
dignity would remain. Even in poverty and
obscurity the O’Connor and the O'Brien
would be immeasurably above the Murphy
and tile Mulligan, and the Campbell and
the Macdonald would be of different clay
from the llogg and the Haig, the reason
being that Murpiiy, Hogg and co. never
belonged to established tribal organisations
which raised armies. Therefore O’Connor
and Macdonald would be the King’s men.
I heir status would be recognised by those
above them, and—what is much more im-
portant—by those below them.
Many things are possible in a land where
everybody of importance is some sort of
councillor”; where a man is described by
Jus occupation so as to distinguish Mrs. Mer-
chant Schmidt from Mrs. Chiefcashier
Schmidt; where the guest who takes an
expensive apartment at a hotel has “High-
born” or “Wellborn” prefixed to his name
on lus bill to show that he didn’t take a
cheap apartment; and where one may dwell
111 a . flut or a ‘‘high-gentle-
manly fiat, according to the price of the flat.
An organisation like that is difficult to
negotiate with, or to disrupt. In a sense it
resembles the Roman Catholic Church. The
lioad of the church is the Pope. Following
him are the cardinal-bishops, cardinal-
priests, cardinal-deacons, patriarchs, arch-
bishops, bishops and other dignitaries. At
the far end of the procession may be
descried the humble colored cleric who min-
isters to a humble, colored flock on the upper
waters of the Irrawaddy or the Amazon. His
chance of wearing the Fisherman’s ring isn’t
one in ten billions, but he is pari of the
great order, and his loyalty is reliable. Some-
what similar is the Hindu religious attitude.
There may be no great joy in belonging to
the humblest caste—in fact, the beggar of
high spiritual degree looks down on the
prince of lower spiritual status—but to the
believer it is infinitely better than being an
unattached citizen. Germanism is a religion,
ancr the name of it is “kultur.” It is ahead
of other religions inasmuch as it is at once
political, industrial, military and spiritual.
It is world-wide like Roman Catholicism, for
there are Germans scattered all over the
earth, and even though they may take oaths
of allegiance to foreign Powers they are
expected to remain true to the graven
images of Potsdam. Like Naaman, they bow
down in the house of Rimmon for gain and
with large mental reservations. The Brah-
min idea is a poor thing by comparson, be-
cause there is no hereditary boss Brahmin
with power to reward service by promotion
from one caste to another. The Hun
Church has a country of its own, a capital
and an army, which the other religious com-
binations lack. It lias something like an
infallible head as Roman Catholicism has.
and it has a visible divine representative on
earth, which Hinduism lacks. And a con-
spicuous tenet of the Hun doctrine is that
‘‘No faith need be kept with heretics.” This
idea has long been growing, but recently it
arrived at maturity. For many centuries
the Emperors of Germany called their
dominions the Holy Roman Empire, and
claimed to be the heirs of Rome, of the
CntSAKS, and of God, the guardians of the
Faith, the dispensers of crowns—the great
Charles, of Burgundy, missed becoming a
king because a shadowy and impecunious
emperor didn’t hand out the title —and in a
sense by their right of Veto the makers of
God’s vicar on earth. The shifting of the
capital from Vienna to Berlin hasn’t abated
thc-se gigantic pretensions. It has put only
a better army, a better organisation, and a
more virile race at the back of them.
It is impossible to negotiate on any equal
terms with a machine of such arrogance. The
abolition of a Kaiser will have no effect any
more than the deposition of a Pope would
destroy Roman Catholicism. The Hun
religion, as already mentioned, is a vast
system of caste, like the Hindu creed. There
is no one to appeal to on grounds of mere
logic or humanity, except the pariah. The
Mahdi and the Khalifa tried to construct a
somewhat similar system in the. Soudan, and
all they required was seven times as many
fighting men and seven centuries more “kul-
tur” and they might have made another
Prussia. Their power was broken by the
scattering of all their armies, the abolition
of the monarchy and all the titles and digni-
ties attached to it, the blowing up of the
tomb of the local Frederick the Great as a
sign that the glory was finished, the annexa-
tion of all the conquests, and a general dis-
armying of the population. In fact the
“kultur” of the new empire was torn up by
the root. The work lasted through a good
many years, but when it was finished the
Hun of the Upper Nile had learned the
essential lesson that he was just an ordinary
human being. In his own small way the
Khalifa pointed a moral. And when you
have a moral pointed out to you it might
be worth while having a look at.
THE CROCODILE TEARS OF
MELBOURNE “AGE.”
Melbourne Age is the epitome of the
Melbourne spirit—the one which has
elevated Melbourne to the extraordinary
position in which it contains more than half
the population of the State, is absorbing
all the new population acquired by the State,
and is taking some of the old population
from other parts of the State to swell its
grandeur. It was probably with a desire to
disarm any suspicion that it might not be
absolutely fair to places which are not Mel-
bourne that the Age devoted an article
(31/8/T8) to Portland, the most remark-
able sample which Australia possesses of the
lost-dog seaport —the place that was intended
for greatness, but had greatness stolen from
it at vast expense to the country by a con-
spiracy of accidental vested interests. There
are oilier localities in very similar case —
Albany (W.A.), Port Stephens and Twofold
Bay (N.S.W.), Gladstone and Bowen (Q.),
are a few —and the same lesson does for all,
but Portland is the most sulking text.
* * * *
The dead little town started before Mel-
bourne did. There was a settlement on Port
Phillip Bay in 1803, and at Westernport, not
far off, about 1820, but they were both aban-
doned as failures. Portland made a real
beginning in 1834, and Melbourne was
founded by an expedition from Tasmania a
year later. The elder town had a great pros-
pect before it. It still has a great prospect
—behind it. The harbor is a natural one.
It is a great stretch of deep water ready
for the lug ships to occupy;—not the big ships
of 1834, but those of 1918. Melbourne is
located on a ditch-like river which, after swal-
low nig money for a long lifetime in the effort
to make it a real commercial waterway, is
still unable to accommodate up-to-date vessels.
Then the 30-mile track across the bay from
the ditch-river to the sea is to a great extent
an expensive artificial contrivance, and
inside the entrance, over 30 miles from Mel-
bourne, there were once very serious
obstacles. There is even a rather better
harbor —Westernport—a few miles from
MeH-'-t.rne, but the expedition from Tas-
mania which began to settle the destiny of
the State didn’t happen to go there. It
came over in a schooner or ketch, going to
Port Phillip instead of Portland, because it
was nearer, and because Port Phillip was
known through the fact that the disgruntled
settlement of 1803 had shifted to Tasmania.
It went up the Yarra in a whale-boat; and
there being plenty of water for its vessels, it
gave a ketch-and-whale-boat verdict. The
verdict (by Batman) was, “This will be
the place for a village.” Still, for a long
time Portland was regarded as the coming
city. Tbe Age records how a man who owned
most of what is now Collingwood and Fitz-
roy sold out to settle in the more promising
town further west. The unimproved value
of what he sold is some millions to-day. What
he bought with the money is represented by
some vacant land in a dying town and by a
deserted pub. Portland hasn’t a fraction of
the shipping it possessed 60 years ago—in
fact at most times there is none at all. The
forest grows within a few miles of the town.
The streets are lonesome, and housing
accommodation is old and fairly abundant. A
little over 2000 people linger in the atmos-
phere of decay.
* * * *
In 1836 the great boss Government at
Sydney created a sort of deputy Government
for Victoria, then called Port Phillip, and
stationed its Pooh Bah at Melbourne, because
the more notable town of Portland was much
further away. The Pooh Bah collected a
court about him, and a bishop and other
appurtenances, and when the State set up
for itself Melbourne was naturally the capi-
tal, because the Pooh Baii was there. But
it wasn’t till railway building commenced
that its position was assured. In countries
which built their railways as private enter-
prises the iron highways went out in direc-
tions where most traffic might be expected.
They didn’t necessarily start at the capital,
and all meet there, and all branch out from
there; thus in England and the United States
and Canada the metropolis wasn’t the point
of beginning. But in Australia the first con-
sideration was the profit and glorification or
the big city where the' clique of politicians
was centred. The one and only advantage of
private enterprise in railways is that the
headquarters and treasury and the directing
mind of a railway may be anywhere—thus
in Britain there are head offices at places
like Barry, Oswestry, Barrow-in-Furness.,
Maryport, Swindon, Stroke-on-Trent, Port
Talbot and others the very names of which
are hardly known here. The lines weren’t
based on political pull, but on the necessity
to earn their oats —a matter of little conse-
quence in this land, where there was always
the public income to draw upon. The joint-
stock owners couldn't afford to kill or ignore
a place that would yield income in order to
gratify the vanity or greed of another place
that didn't yield them income. The one dis-
advantage of public ownership lies in the
domimition of the gang of swindlers or men
of parish outlook who run the public. They
are railway directors who haven’t their for-
tunes tied up in the enterprise they direct,
and who get their directorial fees in any
case. > lf they ruin or destroy a great possible
city like Eden or Portland or Albany, and
rriake the railway system a dead loss for Gek
of the revenues it should have got from these
places, they get their reward in votes and
possibly bribes from Sydney or Melbourne or
berth. And they can tax what remains of
the dead places to pay for the dead places'
rum.
So the general rule has been to grant good
railway facilities to any locality except the
ones where they, would pay best, for big
payments mean local prosperity, and local
prosperity means a challenge to the bloated
capitals supremacy. Newcastle couldn’t be
quite ignored, for the coal-mines couldn’t be
a e Pt closed or isolated without disaster to
Sydney; also a place where a turbulent
population could hold up the principal coal
supply of Australia had to be treated with a
measure of respect. But everything that
can be diverted to Sydney—wheat export,
wool export and the like—-is diverted. Eden
and Port Stephens, of course, never got any
railway, though a lot of money was wasted
and prospective profit sacrificed to take a
line round the latter place at a safe distance.
Portland got a line as a matter of form and
as a proof that there was no selfishness or
bias. It got the line when Melbourne was
sure it was dead. That is to say, a railway
was built to connect its harbor with Mel-
bourne harbor, just as a direct route might
be laid clown between the Newcastle coal-
mines and the Lithgow coal-mines, so that
they might swap coals. But it didn’t con-
nect with the inland which would naturally
trade that way, nor was it meant to make
I ortland a direct outlet to Europe. The
track is crooked, circuitous, built of inferior
materials and with rates carefully adjusted
to divert the. last possible scrap of trade to
the metropolis. There is also a connection
with the S.A. border a few miles distant, but
the district connected with is run from dis-
tant Adelaide with railway charges adjusted
m purely Adelaide interests. The Closed or
Discouraged Ports represent Australia’s most
remarkable way of losing money. Every
blade of grass in their streets has been paid
for out of loans, and there seems to be! no
hope for them till each of them sets up as the

ABOUT A COMPOSITOR OF WEAK
INTELLECT.
Dear Bulletin,— l notice that A. 11.
Griffith, who was a Minister of N. S.
Wales under McGowen and Holman, and
was appointed an ex-Minister when Holman
reconstructed, has been writing about the
need of more direct and strenuous Minis-
terial control of Government departments.
He complains, if I understand him aright, of
the dulness, wastefulness, slowness, expen-
siveness and circumlocutionary habits of the
Public Service Board. It was appointed as
a remedy for muddle, favoritism, nepotism,
overcrowding and circumlocution, and it
speedily grew to be a petrified host in itself.
Vv ith all which I agree. He says that the
Minister requires authority to rid the ser-
vice, by his own prompt act, of thieves and
drunkards, and so long as that doesn’t imply
the power to appoint to the service, by his
own act, thieves, brothers-in-law, drunkards
and second cousins I agree again. In fact
I more than agree ; I applaud in a way that
is calculated to make the welkin totter on
its basis. And he mentions the mutinous,
anti-Australian ways of some departmental
heads who, unchecked by the Public Sluggish
Board, give preference to foreign goods over
Australian on every possible occasion, even
if the foreign goods are dearer. There, again,
I. am with him. I believe some Barnacles
ot departments specify “oregon pine” in
build ng contracts out of pure malevolence
and hatred of this country, or out of old,
decomposed habit, and that they don’t care
twopence even if they know that the stuff
is shoddy and absurdly expensive, and that
there are practically no ships to bring it
here. I don't think the evil will be wholly
cured until all this generation—the land-
sale-money and loan-money and gold-rush-
money generation—is dead and part of the
next generation also.
I think my experience goes back further
than Mr. Griffith’s. I remember the time
when the really big loans and big land-sale
money were just beginning to come in. and
the big interest bill hadn’t seriously begun
to go out, and there was more loot and
fewer people to divide the loot. In those
days—they didn’t last long—an anxious
Minister with money to get rid of would
sometimes buttonhole a member and ask
him to think hard and decide if there wasn’t
something he wanted in his electorate. And
the public service was wonderfully casual.
My chief experience concerned a youngish
compositor of weak intellect. When I came
to Sydney as a mere assistant sub-editor, he
followed me from my previous haunts and
asked me to “get him put on” at the Gov-
ernment Printing Office. I gave him a letter
to an obscure politician with whom I had
already struck up an acquaintance, and he
—either out of good nature or with the idea
that even an assistant sub-editor might have
his uses—furnished a letter to the then Gov-
ernment Printer, directing that the unknown
should be “put on.” He lasted only a week
owing to his insufficient intellect, and then
he returned himself on my hands. I gave
him a letter to the other obscure member
that I knew slightly, and again he was “put
on.” He was back four times after that,,
and I gave him letters to four unimportant
members, whom I had never met, and each
tiipe the horrified Printer saw him coming,
put up with him for a time, and was very
glad to see him going. Ultimately I lost the
run of him. I tried to pass him on to my
own chief, but that gentleman was busy just
then getting a hopelessly impracticable poet
into the Savings Bank and a dreamy and
unpunctual bard into the Treasury.
The glamor was then wearing off the loans
and the land-sale money, and people began
to say things. There was, for some reason or
other, an inquiry into the Lands Dept. It was
reported, if I remember rightly, that there
wasn’t sitting-room for the superabundant
staff, largely appointed in the same way as
my compositor, and that they had to take
turns in walking about the streets. There
was an upheaval and a weeding out. and
after that affairs began to settle down again.
In other words, new men began to arrive


with letters- from subsequent politicians, in
place of the old men who had arrived w itn
letters from previous politicians. Naturali.v
there was more upheaval. A time came when
George lleid had to only charge about lime
months’ interest on the public debt to the
year's account in order to make a surplus,
the rest of the interest being carried forward
to next year's account. Quite a number ot
public servants got the run when the bad
times came, and the saving of salaries
helped the Treasury a lot. The payment ot
the compensation legally due to them they
not being sacked for misconduct —would
have hindered the Treasury a lot. so tVa
were largely recompensed out of the Public
Service Superannuation Fund. This helped
the Treasury a great lot. The Fund was
maintained by compulsory contributions
from the public servants, and was calculated
to be just sufficient to cover the pensions
due to those who retired through old age or
permanent infirmity. The gorgeous act of
loot that was worked on it broke its back,
and it became glaringly insolvent. It became
more insolvent every time it was looked at.
The Government kept a great deal of silence
about what was to happen. Then the news
leaked out that any public official who felt
that way might cease contributing and give
up his pension rights. The money he had
already put in would be returned on his
death or retirement with 3 per cent, simple
interest. The old men who were near the
retiring age mostly held on hoping that
enough money would be found to pay their
pensions for the few years left to them. The
young men, to a great extent, accepted the
miserable offer, it being their opinion that
otherwise they might be paying for another
25 or MO years to a fund which would be a
dead horse before they could make any
claim on it. So the State got the use of
their money at 3 per cent, simple interest.
It was worth fully 41 per cent, compound
interest, and the difference is just this: £lOO
invested at 3 per cent, simple interest for 30
years is £lOO, while the same amount in-
vested at 41 per cent, compound interest for
the same time is £374 10s. The money
wasn’t even refunded at 3 per cent, on
retirement if the public servant retired by
compulsion into the Federal service through
his department being taken over. It was
retained till he died or was superannuated
in his Federal capacity. The State Treasury
made quite a lot this way. It was a terrible'
falling away from the time when I could
get a compositor of weak intellect into six
different, jobs at the Government Printing
Office.
* * * #
To prevent the old evils resuming—-if they
had ever ceased to resume—and to eliminate
the political element, the service was put
under the control of a Board consisting of
three elderly or partially superannuated
gentlemen—there may have been occasion-
ally a less superannuated gentleman, but he
was the exception. They were trained in
the official rut. They were mostly beyond
the time of life when a man learns new
things—aviation, submarine navigation, the
use of gas shells, and the like. Not one of
them had the energy to go whale-fishing for
sport. Few men beyond a certain time of
life take much joy in planting new trees or
new ideas which they can’t expect to see
grow up. So pomp took the place of corrup-
tion, and honest inefficiency came instead of
dishonest and wildly-picturesque incapacity,
and promotion became as elaborate as a
coronation. Nowadays it would be impossi-
ble to get a compositor of deficient intellect
into the N. S. Wales Public Service —suppos-
ing he could be got in under any conditions
—save by the aid and connivance of three
Commissioners at £lOOO a year each; a
secretary at £700; an inspector at £700; a
registrar at £550; a chief clerk at £425; 20
clerks ranging from £4OO down to £GO; and
another official at £75. (These are the
latest returns I can find.) And I suppose it
would take all these persons to get him out
again, whereas he used to go in at a
moment’s notice and come out on his ear,
the only cause for complaint being that he
went in too often and didn’t come out often
enough. On the whole, I preferred the old
service. It didn’t take itself very seriously,
but. then, no one could take it very seri-
ously.—Yours, etc., Solomon Malaprop.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Norton Griffiths Madness.
A tombstone was put over the dust of a
disgraceful and ruinous transaction when
Davis, N. S. Wales Director-General of
Public Works, issued his report on the
Norton Griffiths contract. It was devised
about the end of 1914, and signed in April,
1915, by a Labor Government of the follow-
ing persons:—
W. A. Holman, John Estell,
D. R, Hall, George Black,
Arthur Griffith, 11. C. Hoyle,
W. G. Ashford. W. C. Grahame.
J. D. Fitzgerald,
Also John -Henry Cann, J. L. Tkffi.e, A.
C. Carmichael and Fred Flowers were
responsible, being in office when the silly
iniquity was arranged though not when it
was actually signed. And the Labor Caucus,
including John Storey, was responsible, it
being in power both when the iniquity was
devised and when it was signed. At the
very beginning of the war the Labor Govern-
ment realised that loans might become scarce
and dear, and that the public-works boom
might slow down. This was practically the
only time it looked ahead. It had only spent
£16.000.000 of loan money in two years, and
it felt anxious. So the Norton Griffiths
agreement came to pass. The bond provided
that certain English capitalists should raise
£10,000,000 with the aid of a non-Australian
joint-stock and capitalistic bank —the kind
that the Labor party says should be wiped
out —the interest being such as might hap-
pen, at a time when many things were liable
to happen. And this private firm of capital-
ists was to build a lot of public works on the
loathsome contract system, receiving as
middlemen 5 per cent, commission on the
money spent. The works were to include: —
Sydney Citv railway.
Broken Hill-Condobolin railway.
Dubbo-Werris Creek railway.
Sydenham-Botany railway.
Forbes-Stock inbingal railway.
Wafea-Tumbarumba railway.
North Coast railway (remaining sections).
Warragamba waterworks.
Chichester waterworks.
Mnrrumbiclgee canal (enlargement).
(’off's Harbor works.
Thus a Labor Government and party, winch
were the last word in financial incapacity,
not only hired a concern winch was a mix-
ture of contract labor and capitalistic enter-
prise to raise money for them, but to spend
it for them. To think that such beauties
as these should be in charge of public affairs
seems past belief. Of course, the business
was a failure. The private firm 011 which
the Labor-leaders relied couldn’t raise
money when money wasn’t to be had
any more than a Labor Government
could do so. It should have found £4,000,000
in 1915-16; it actually discovered £1,112,000.
The work done was hideously expensive—
naturally, when the contractors were paid b.\
the amount they spent, not by the amount they
saved. It was said to be not amazingly good
work —naturally, seeing that the contractors
hadn’t to spend the rest of their lives along-
side the works, and weren’t responsible for
making them pay, and had no good political
billets which a disappointed populace could
take from them when the bubble burst. And
the inevitable result of starting more under-
takings than usual all in a heap at a time
when the finding of money for them was
more problematical than usual was that
nothing was finished when the whole business
fell through except the Labor Government’s
reputation for political honesty and common-
sense. And even that wasn’t finished, for
it had ended with the inauguration of the
party’s loan boom years before. As a result,
the State is littered with incomplete .iobs
which earn little or nothing and are falling
into decay, and eating up interest. Under
the party system there is not even the
satisfaction of revenge, for if llolman and
Hall and Gkatiame, who are responsible
for the silly job, are put out of office, it seems
that Storey and Estell, who are also re-
sponsible, will come in.
A New Version of the Bung and the
Spigot.
A groan arose from some N. S. Wales
newspapers recently about the alleged scan-
dal incidental to the fact that members of
Parliament had not been paying income tax
on their wages as legislators. And when a
Bill was produced in the Assembly remedying
this the occurrence was received with some
cheers and conventional reflections on the
necessity for “everyone doing his bit” and
so on. In a superficial way it seems obvious
enough that if Bill Smith, taxpayer, has to
pay income tax Tom Jones, taxspender,
ought to be under the same obligation. Tiie
Bulletin advances no reason against Tom
.Tones being touched for income tax in the
ordinary way. But at rock bottom the posi-
tion of the ordinary citizen and the parlia-
mentarian are not quite parallel. There is
something in the nature of a fake in the State
paying a man, say, £GOO a year with one hand
and taking £lO or so away with the other.
In the end it boils down to no more than
a concession to convention. It seems more
important to the State that these people
should do their job properly than that they
should be allowed to make a parade of virtue
about incomp-tax payment. If they served
the community as they ought to do—if they
were reasonably honest in discharging the
contract they are paid for —there would be
plenty of argument in favor of exempting
them from income tax continuously. There
are 90 members of the Legislative Assembly.
It is probably a fair thing to assume that
after allowances are taken into account each
member will under the new arrangement pay
about £l2 in tax. That gives £B4O. Let
it even be doubled and say the return will be
£l6OO a year or thereabouts. Last week
there was laid on the table of the Assembly
a report from the Director-General, of Works
in reference to certain features of the
Norton Griffiths contract. From this it
transpired that under that calamitous
arrangement the cost of administration alone
increased 23 per cent., leaving a loss under
this heading on £1,936.288 soent of £374,328,
exclusive of increased wages. Had the con-
tract been carried on to the bitter end the
loss would have been £3,866,450. But by
giving N. and G. £300.000 to drop out this
was reduced to £674,328 —thrown into the
gutter of waste down which a copious stream
is always running. A simole calculation
shows that the largest possible amount to be
secured by way of income tax from members
of the Assembly would not pay one-twentieth
of the annual interest charge on the blister
left behind by Norton Griffiths, and
would not wipe out the entire loss in 1600
years. And it does no harm to remember
that this illustration of what can be per-
petrated by a reckless and profligate Legisla-
ture is only one of scores easily discoverable.
It would pay the citizens of the State to
double or quadruple the wages of the member
of Parliament, and give him, his heirs and
assigns for all eternity exemption from income
tax, if in return for this allowance there was
given a service which even approximated
satisfaction.

A Society for the Prevention of the
Loan.
The time is ripe, to use an old phrase, for
the formation of a Society for Not Being
Found Dead with the Loan. The objects
of such a society would be simple. Its mem-
bers would pledge themselves not to sub-
scribe to a new loan nor to buy any interest
in an old one. They would urge their friends
to keep clear of the loan, and do the same
with anv and every financial institution in
which they had an interest. They would
devise an Anti-Loan badge. Also they would
scoff when the Loan was mentioned, and it
they could scoff in England as well as here
it would be so much the better. This atti-
tude wouldn’t apply of course to renewal
loans, which unfortunately can’t be avoided;
on the contrary, the Society for turning the
glassy eye on New Loans should give them
its best support, and encourage, the Govern-
ment to renew, as far as possible, in Aus-
tralia debts that fall due in England, so as
to make them our own affair spending the
interest in Australia, instead of an outside or
absentee affair spending its income in
Europe. It should even pledge itself to put
into the renewal loan all the money it saved
by not subscribing to the new one ; in fact, if
the latter was £2,000,000 short (and it ought
to be shorter than that) the society might
bind itself to find £8,000,000 for the former
by way of compensation. It would thus help
to make the new loan very dear, and the
renewal one fairly cheap. Just to prevent
misconception it may be stated here that this
policy isn’t intended to apply to new War
loans', which are necessary and which should
be enthusiastically supported as being the
only deserving specimens of their kind. It
isn’t meant to apply to Commonwealth securi-
ties of any sort, except when the Common-
wealth is raising money for State purposes—
not renewal purposes, but new purposes. But
with these limitations the boycott should be
absolute. The proposal isn’t one of theft or
confiscation or interference with anybody's
property or industry. It isn’t a strike, which
is suspension of an established industry: the
idea is that the old loan industry should be
strengthened by making better provision
against possible default, but that there should
be no extension. In other words, the old pub
is to be put in better order and the license
assured, but the total number of pubs isn’t
to increase. There are three solid objec-
tions to new loans for peace (*.e., public
works) purposes: (1) They absorb money
which is much more urgently needed for
defence purposes; (2) they absorb money
that is urgently wanted to renew old loans,
for if these are not renewed—and as the
debt grows bigger the renewal difficulty
becomes constantly more difficult and danger-
ous—there will be an accident that will make
fearful wreckage of every kind of industry ;
(3) they tend to put the affairs of the coun-
try into the hands of men who know nothing
about affairs, and who disguise their in-
capacity by being generous and large-minded
and progressive at the cost of posterity. If
after 50 or'6o years of hard borrowing for the
development of the country Australia is far
less able than it was a decade ago to do with-
out borrowing, then it really seems that bor-
rowing isn’t the way to develop the country.
Statistician Knibbs, with all possible infor-
mation at his disposal, estimates that the
value of everything produced in Australia in
1916(the production figures take an immense
amount of collecting, so they don’t get fur-
ther than the end of 1916) was £82.693,000
more than in 1910. The debts of the States
(no war debt is included in that lot) were
£100,190.000 more in 1916 than in 1910.
The situation was really worse than that, for
£5.597.000 of State debt was turned into
Commonwealth debt in 1911 and taken out of
the above calculation. If this mere book-
keeping entry is isrnored the peace debts in-
creased by £lO6 087.000. while production—
the results of the development of the coun-
try with the aid of loans—grew by
£82.693,000. The new financial year is two
months old, and N. S. Wales, which is
borrowing more heavily than all its five
neighbors put together, and which is the one
remaining State that floats its own lOU in
London, shows some remarkable results. It
is said that the income is £352.113 per month
more than it was last year. Curiously
enough the Government is borrowing just
about £350.000 a month, mostly in England,
to support the artificial prosperity that makes
the increase, it is added that the expansion
is fully £250.000 per month more than the
amount l’eckoned on— i.e.. the amount reanb’ed
to pay liabilities. But there is no mention
of a proposal to reduce the "loan expenditure
by £250,000 a month and use the unexpected
revenue to till the gap. That would be con-
trary to precedent, and it might diminish the
hollow boom. Assuredly it is time to have a
Society for Being Dead Tired of the Loan-
Wandering Billy.
When Hughes was last in New York lie
kept himself in working order by telling the
Harvard Club all about the Australian mining
industry, and what he had done to “rescue
it from the Germans.” And, as occasional,
his yarn was disordered flight of imagina-
tion. An extract therefrom (as reported in
the American Engineering and Mining
Journal, 15/6/T8) :
Our mines were entirely under the control of
German capital when the war came. They are no
longer under that control. Arrangements have been
made by which, for 25 years to come, the control
cannot be re-established. But to be fair, German
energy and capital were very fair to us. After we
took over the mines ourselves we found the plants
and organisations so excellent that we were able to
begin at once the making of ships and munitions.
Without the German pioneer work we never could
have got going so well or so fast.
Well, will Hughes consider these items:
(1) the position of the Australian mining
industry before the war, (2) the happenings
after the war, (3) his own assertions re-
garding German influence on the metal
market while he was tearing up upas trees
with frenzied orations, or (4) the
results following upon his _ alleged
taking over? How many mines or
mining plants in Australia have been taken
over by the Commonwealth ? How many are
there which could even by the Berlin Tage-
blatt be accused of owing their existence
and efficiency to German organisation !
What are the names of the mines which had
been provided with plant and organisation
“so excellent” by Germans that even the
wretched Australian engineers and metallur-
gists were able to carry on? And if the
part the German actually did play in relation
to Australian mining was “very beneficial,”
what in the name of thunder does this
acquaintance of the lamented Munchausen
mean by his yells about German influence
having been most damnable in its effects and
the need of not allowing it to destroy us by
being beneficial any more and generally about
the identity between beneficence and blue
ruin? Of course it is not much use asking
Hughes these questions or any others. But
it is worth every reasonably intelligent Aus-
tralian trying to answer them for him-
self. The facts are that mining opera-
tions in Australia compare favorably with
similar undertakings elsewhere not because
Germans did the work —which they didn’t -
but because of the resourcefulness of local
engineers and metallurgists. For Hughes to
throw mud at them in order to give color to
fantastic claims regarding personal achieve-
ments is a matter for Hughes’s taste.

“Pte. Enterprise” : The conflagration rag-
ing in the Old World notwithstanding, and
the subsequent damage to the markets for
raw materials, the advance of Papua, Aus-
tralia’s oldest (and most neglected) terri-
tory overseas, goes steadily forward. For
the year ended June 30, 1917, the total
exports, after deducting goods received from
other countries and re-exported, came to
£150.000. Copra. £40,882; copper ore,
£14.050; gold (bullion and concentrates),
£37.988; sisal hemp, £11,463; rubber,
£26,682: trochas shell, £8050; mangrove
bark, £4423; beche-de-mer, £2521; pearls.
£2400; and timber, £438, are the principal
exports. Compared with last year’s figures
(£113,000) the volume of trade beyond the
Possession has increased £37,000 —over 34
per cent. The main increases are: copra,
£40,882, against £19,000 last year—over 100
per cent.: copper ore, £14.050, against
£9971 —nearly 50 per cent.; rubber, £26,652,
against £14,846 —97 per cent.; and trochas
shell. £BO5O, against £6770—20 per cent.
Mangrove bark makes its appearance for the
first time. The increased export of copra
and rubber is the result of a portion of the
large areas planted during 1908 and 1909
coming into the producing stage. These
figures are nothing to what can be expected
from these two sources of wealth within the
next four or five years, for rubber will easily
reach £250.000, and copra some £300,000,
when the 7000 acres and 35,000 acres,
respectively, devoted to these products attain
their full production. And these are only
two of the many valuable economic products
that Papua can grow successfully. Coffee,
cocoa, tea, tobacco, maize, bananas, ground
nuts and sugar would also be in the export
list if Australia’s policy of shutting out her
own territories’ products by her present
tariff was repealed and decent preferential
treatment accorded the good Australian
planters who are struggling to make a valu-
able Australian possession. Under the present
restrictions, the man on the land in Papua is
not given a fair deal; the Papuan Govern-
ment gives him the land on liberal terms,
and the Commonwealth, the actual land-
lords of the territory, tax his produce as if
he was a Chinese or Javanese citizen. It is
up to Australian statesmen to do something
to assist their brother Australians in New
Guinea.
“Boree” : N. S. Wales Department of Lands
has started an “animal industry branch” to
further a couple of good notions of Minister
Ashford. One scheme is to save and rear
calves that the dairy cocky would knock on
the head, and the other is to supply to stock-
owners in times of drought information where
grass is to be had. Working details are left,
as usual, to country stock-agents, the Depart-
ment taking one per cent, of any commission
going as a set-off against expenses. Effici-
ently done, this should save the lives of a
very great number of sheep and cattle. As
things work out now the average stockowner
hangs on in a dry spell, hoping for a change,
until the animals are nearly at the last gasp.
Then he rushes to the local stock-agent to
find the address of a district where he can
hire grass. Most of the local stockowners
being seized with the same idea about the
same time, and the knowledge of the_ agent
being limited, a lot of frantic people miss the
’bus —or grass—and more “heavy losses from
drought” are reported. Under Ashford’s

An Ordinary Jew.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You are an I.W.W. are you not?—No.
Ever attend their meetings.?-—No.
You are an anarchist?—No.
You take an interest in politics and conscription ?
—No.
What are you ? —Just a plain working Jew.
—Evidence at the I.W.W. inquiry.
He was just an ordinary, working Jew,
And recognised how many beans make two.
He had no desire to emulate the glory
Of Solomon in dubious, ancient story
Or other fools in Myth’s long category,
lie was not a pirate Hebrew on the seas,
Trimming his, sails to every fickle breeze.
The ocean’s floor with wrecks he did not
strew.
Nor bones. He was a peaceful urban Jew.
A plain, industrious daily kind of Jew
On high Ambition’s wings he never flew,
Nor scaled the diamond ridge of dizzy Pride,
Nor drove his chariot down the rainbow’s
side
As Tiior, the god, did when the world was
wide.
Earth has great store of gems and gold to
spare,
The sea hath pearls that deck the kraken's
hair.
And treasure in drowned cities not a few —-
He sought them not. He was no diving Jew.
He was a brownish, unpretentious Jew,
Not tricked out like the garish cockatoo,
Or beetles with their multi-colored wings,
Or humming-birds and such-like painted
things,
Or Asshur’s horsemen in the Book of
Kings.
Young Genesis, nude, shapeless and uncouth
Fussed over its preliminary tooth
When his most ancient nation hove in view.
Yet he was not a proud and hostile Jew.
Like many mqre he was a married Jew.
His home was brightened by a child or two.
He lived when all the world was upside
down,
And every week some monarch lost his
crown,
And every day some mad prince grew still
madder,
And fangs of rapine bit like Hell’s own
adder.
The sky, propped up by Father Jacob’s
ladder,
Was black with smoke from burning tower
and city,
And God seemed dead, and man seemed lost
to pity.
Yet to his homely instincts he was true.
And tailored like a quiet well-balanced Jew.

of unnecessary miles past unopened ports,
most of the stock should be saved, as it is
seldom the whole State dries up simultane-
ously. Behind both schemes is the idea of
conserving stock, and Heaven knows that is
wanted badly in this land of appalling waste
and loss. Incidentally one wonders why
the Department of Lands is taking on what
are obviously jobs for the Department of
Agriculture? N. S. Wales has a large and
expensive Agricultural Department, but it
seems difficult to wake it up during the last
two or three years. If it has ever heard of
Webster it might turn up his definitions of
progressiveness and enterprise.
The Limping and Bedraggled Hun.
1 iie German spent the first part of summer
Hinging the Allies off a. substantial part of
the map of northern France. Since the
middle of July the Allies have been busy
Hinging him back again, and by the begin-
ning of the week had about finished the job,
with the result that all hands were practi-
cally at the old address. Tlius after six
months of terrific fighting and hard lying
about what was going to happen next, the
German has nothing more to show for the
performance than extensive casualty-lists,
details of numerous vanished guns, the mem-
ory of heaps of abandoned supplies and
particulars of scores of thousands of prison-
ers lost to Foch and Haig. This looks a
somewhat discouraging balance of calamity,
and judging by such nows as is available
has not been received with any great
enthusiasm by the population. Indeed it is
asserted that the inhabitants of the Father-
land are .becoming addicted to making dis-
lespectful remarks about Von llindenbtjrg
and critical comments upon the Kaiser’s peri-
odical speech. If this be true, then a mighty
change has come over the scene, for up till
quite recently a German citizen would no
more have objected to the boot on his neck
than have declined an iron-cross for blowing
up a hospital ship. However, these yarns
ti orn behind the Rhine are never sure
enough. The ocurrences in the vicinity of the
bomb and the barrage are what count, for
the Allies are certainly not going to
wm by achieving moral victories in
the interior of Germany if the armies
remain undefeated in the trenches. Since
the fray drew nearer the llindenburg
line resistance has stiffened, and it now re-
mains to be seen whether the enemy can
shut the door on himself—-and keep it shut.
Into the switch” sector the Allies have
pushed a handy bulge at a point where any
further advance would be a disaster of the
greatest magnitude to the German. If the
Allies could seize Cambrai and Douai, or
even get possession of the roads and railway
thereabouts, the enemy would have good
reason for suffering from nightmares. That
position is vital to the whole of his line run-
ning northward to the sea. It is at least
conceivable that the llindenburg line mav
not be so formidable an obstacle as it was
a year ago. That is the principal thing to be
determined in the next few weeks. New
“ay solve a problem which bristled
with difficulties when previously attacked. If
the Allies can establish any substantial
ascendancy now over the German tunnels
and caves before the frost and rain arrive
their own crop of troubles will be much re-
duced. The prospect of wintering in the
former position again must, in view of what
has happened since in the wav of devasta-
tion, be about as cheerful as spending a wet
cay in a tent which has all blown away
except the pegs. "

The Home of Shortages and Melancholy.
Tije TVestralian Treasurer, who isn’t a
dazzling Treasurer, has made a gloomy
statement to a very depressed House This
was about what he had to tell, though he
didnt tell all of it. Westralia had all its
booms at once—gold, land, borrowing and
imrnigi ation; so they naturally all decayed
at onc-e. It showed only one sign of taking
thought for the morrow inasmuch as it
attached a sinking-fund to every loan, but
the blessed thing made it feel so proud that
every time it paid 13 into the fund an extra
±lO was borrowed. The net State or peace
debt is now £ll6 ss. 9d. per head, and with
its share of the Federal or war debt (£49
I'®-) Westralia owes £166 2s. 9d. per head,
which is the record. The revenue (£l4 16s.
6d. per head last year) is still far the big-
gest on record, but it is a falling revenue,
while those of the other States are rising,
and the place has been accustomed to razzle
at the rate of as much as £2O per head and
hasn t grown accustomed to its fallen but
still glittering fortunes. The deficit has
become a regular thing and is about the big-
gest peace deficit ever heard of in propor-
tion to population. The accumulated shortage
now runs into millions (£5,005,478 at the
end of August, which is almost exactly equal
to the accumulated sinking-fund of which the
State was so proud). During August the
State trading concerns made a loss of
x 09,000, which looks like dropping money at
the rate of over £430,000 a year. The total
deficit for August was £307.000, which was
a good deal for one month, though of course
it was an exceptional month ; a shortage of
£3,600,000 for the year is impossible. The
special charitable allowance from the Com-
monwealth ends in 1920. Also the subsidy
which the Commonwealth pays to all the
States expires in 1920, and with the military
fuss on its hands the Federal Parliament
isn’t likelv to renew it. Borrowing in Lon-
don except for renewal purposes is off, and
borrowing in Australia is largely hampered
by the demand for war loans. A weary Gov-
ernment has moved the Commonwealth
Government to move the British Government
to consent to a suspension of the sinking-
fund. A reason why Westralia had a won-
derful run of cheap loans was the fact that
it made the sinking-fund a hard-and-fast bar-
gain with the British authorities, and the
money was paid into the hands of trustees
in London, so that no impecunious Treasurer
could vet at it. This made W.A. loans speci-
ally gilt-edged, but in this time of stress it
is proposed that the British investor shall
still have the loans, but shall lose the gilt. If
the scheme comes off. which ought not to
happen, it will be at least a drop in the
bucket. If it doesn’t eventuate —if there is
no drop, but lots of bucket —the Common-
wealth is to see Westralia through. It:
will probably have to do that in any case —-
not really for the sake of Westralia, but
because a country in which 4,900,000 people
owe £620,000,000 is in a carefully balanced
attitude, as practically all the loans fall due
at fixed dates, and the failure of one big
renewal might give the inverted pyramid of
credit a dangerous cant to leeward. The
regular policy of J. Bull has been to make
his loans payable on the Day of Judgment, so
that there would be no renewal crisis to face.
The Commonwealth carries the deficits of
the Northern Territory and the Canberra
folly, and is specially subsidising Westralia
and Tasmania in a small way, so it is finan-
cial stepmother to a good part of the con-
tinent. Westralia in one important respect
is a shocking example. Last year it actually
raised less money by direct taxation than
little Tasmania. Every year since the war
find the heroic deficits began, it has levied
on its hampered people less direct taxes per
head than any other State. In 1916 it only
demanded 235. Bd. from each inhabitant,
where Queensland demanded 425. 9d., Tas-
mania 38s. _ 3d. and Victoria 335. 4d. Its
supine, shifty Ministers preferred deficits
and appeals for Federal aid to plain hard
graft. Two at least of its long terrace of
shortages would have been turned into sur-
pluses by the simple process of putting up
taxes to the level of the little island which
is the mere baby, of the Federal league and
which never had any booms worth mention-
ing.
Mr. Hughes “Twits.”
Me. Hughes, according to a. cablegram
which cost more than it was worth, delivered
a strongly Protectionist speech at Manches-
ter. and “twitted the Guardian on its Free-
trade attitude.” Also, “while confessing his
own Freetrade fanaticism of the past, the
circumstances of the war had taught him
that he could only remain true to the shibbo-
leth by being unfaithful to the country.” As
regards which it can only be said that the
cheek of Hughes is bigger than ox-cheek
at 1 OArl. per lb., and the side of a cathedral
isn’t to be compared with it for area. He
ought, to get into a corner and twit himself
to death. There was always a difference
between his position and that of the Man-
chester Guardian. That paper belongs to a
country where labor was comparatively
cheap until recently, and a cheap labor coun-
try can get along to some extent without
Protection. Hughes belongs to a country
where labor was always comparatively dear,
and he had the examples of the United
States, Canada, Argentina. Germany and
Japan shouting in his ear these three facts:
(1) fhe only way for a high-wage country
to become a great manufacturing country is
by high Protection; (2) the only way that
a comparatively low-wage country that is
just starting its industries can emerge from
the ruck is by high Protection; (3) the case
of Britain isn’t an example, but a solitary
exception, because it didn’t attempt to found
its industries under Freetrade—Protection
had made it the industrial boss of the world
before Cobdenism was even mentioned. Then,
again, the Guardian preached Freetrade in
the world’s greatest shipowning country—
one that carried its goods in its own vessels
and collected freights. Hughes preached it
in a country which depended on other
people s ships and paid freights. Many igno-
rant fools believed in Freetrade. or thought
they did, because it was British, and every-
thing British must be right. Many plausi-
ble scoundrels said they believed in it because
they made their living out of the importing
game, and Australian industries would
diminish their gains. But Australia has pSid
Hughes a salary for 24 years to be wiser
and better and more far-seeing than the mul-
ti tude. The Bulletin’s long-standing
opinion of him was that he was narrow, in-
tensely conceited, utterly and shamefully
ignorant of figures and facts and political
economy, and of the mental habit of the
schoolmaster who has been accustomed to lay
down the law to infants, and measures the
distance between himself and his fellows by
the mental discrepancy between himself and
the infants. If we can judge by the com-
mercial industrial figures of Australia and
of Canada the policy with which Hughes
was besotted has lost this country at least
£200,000,000 during the four years of war.
Now Hughes admits that he was a silly,
false prophet, and so slow and dull that,
though the lessons of the war were before
him in print for three years, he couldn’t
read them till he went to Europe and looked
at the ruins. He seems proud of his death-
bed conversion—the country’s death-bed, not
his. Also, in his best schoolmaster style, he
“twitted” the Manchester Guardian.
Saving Our Bacon.
“Next, Please” : There seems no reason-
able excuse to any longer imagine that Aus-
tralia is not going to fall heavily into the
soup over the wheat business. There is a
vast accumulation of the raw material, two
harvests are unsold, an overdraft of
£14,000,000 is gibbering at the taxpayer—
and the chances of this huge mass of wheat
ever being shifted out of the country are
not _as good even as the lamented Buck-
ley's. It would take years to shift it. and
if we went on growing more wheat during
the transporting period the position would
become one of hopeless imbecility. Badly
though the world may need wheat now, and
ravenously though it will consume flour
after the war, it is certain that the universe
is not going to next week consume enough
to satisfy _ its appetite and then commence
eating all it omitted to eat during last week.
We are up against a mighty big problem. Up
to date there has been a huge loss through
mice and weevils and rain. There was
more loss through restacking and recon-
ditioning. There will certainly be addi-
tional wastage from the same causes. Now
what someone ought to explain is what
Australia is going to do to put these moun-
tains of wheat that are on the premises to
practical use. It is no good building them
up to look at. Nor is it profitable to watch
an asset wasting even if someone else has
made art advance on it. Now everybody
knows that there is material in these stacks
of wheat which could be converted into pig
to the great profit of the community. The
pig is an animal that is rapidly disappearing
from the face of the earth. Europe must
be down to about the last ham. America is
assassinating pigs at a rate never before
dreamed of. It is the American pig that
is feeding England and a large part of the
Allied army. Wherefore as the world is
being stripped of pig, and inasmuch as it is
a quadruped of great commercial value in
consequence of (3 ) the readiness with which
it can be embalmed and (2) the expedition
with which it can be distributed when
defunct, I propose to the Federal Govern-
ment that it should consider the question of
repatriation and pig culture together. Aus-
tralia might be made a land flowing with hams
and bacon instead of one stuffed with decay-
ing wheat and impoverished cockies. Droves
of pigs might depasture all over the land-
scape, and as Hughes’s ships are built they
might bear away abroad cargoes of pickled
and smoked hog, each shipment represen ting-
-10 times the weight and value of a cargo of
wheat. Hams and bacon and canned
sausages and bristles and tanned hide will
sell after the war at a record rate.
The sugar difficulty looks like becoming
expensive. When the last industrial award
was made the Commonwealth met the in-
creased cost of production by buying the
crop at £2l per ton, the Queensland Govern-
ment promising that the wage-rate shouldn’t
be altered while the £2l bargain lasted.' But
a demand, acompanied by a strike, for a 255.
per day minimum wage (the man who earns
355. to get 355., but the man who only earns
15s. to get 255.) threatens to make produc-
tion at £2l per ton a loss. As an incident,
the demand has been made by the “organ-
isers,” who have refused to allow the mere
workers to ballot on the matter. The ques-'
tion is: Will it be cheaper to sacrifice the
cane where the crop is poor and save the
wages, or to pay the wages and make a loss
on the finished operation? The matter is
one that won’t bear thinking over. A sheep,
if its shearing is postponed, only grows more
wool while it is being thought over, but
cane is in a different category. It is some-
thing like a stranded whale; if there is a
prolonged strike or lockout of the whale-
dissectors the casus belli simply becomes a
stink and a dead loss and a pestilence. The
Ryan Ministry shows no enthusiasm about
its share of the business —the enforcing of
the award ; possibly it thinks Watt and Co.
may make the new wage rate feasible by
buying the crop at a bigger price, whereby
a lot more of the money of the other States
will be spent in Queensland. But Watt and
Co. don't want to dally with the tsoublesonu
u- i ot llVlng 5 or 10 start a ball rolling
which may roll a good deal further. Some
times a lolling ball gathers a lot of moss.

Fok a long time the balance of public-
opinion in Britain said that the Hun fleet
wouldn’t come out. People alleged vaguely
that it would be preserved on the remote
chance that it might be saved out of the
wreck in case of failure. Or it might be
offered in -whole or part as a bribe to one
ally (not Britain) to desert the rest. Or it
might be surrendered in consideration of
easier terms in other directions; if a country
reckons it has gone out of sea adventure for
30 years or so its fleet isn’t worth keeping,
though it may be worth selling, for it will
be obsolete inside 30 years. All these theories
were based on the assumption that the Ilun
wouldn’t be so badly beaten as to have no
voice in settling peace terms. Now it is
reported that the opinion is the Hun will
fight on the sea and scrap to the bitter end.
First, the Allies are getting a deadly superi-
ority in the air, and there is talk of 10.000
more airships for next Spring. If such a
fleet can be turned out and manned, which
some United States people allege to be pos-
sible, and it, or even a quarter of it, gets
high above the Kiel Canal and its surround-
ings on a calm clear day, there will be no
linn fleet either to fight or barter with. It
will pass out like Sodom and Gommorrah.
Then, if Focir and co. can keep up the pace
the Hun may get so badly knocked out that
he will have little voice in settling the peace.
The Dutch, when they find which is the
winning side, may come in at the death for
a consideration, and from the extreme end of
their territory big guns could harass some
at least of the German ports and begin to
make the slumbering navy uncomfortable.
Again, supposing the Hun submarine flotilla
can be 'suppressed,, the Anglo-French craft
may begin to eat their way in and force
the pace. Some people say the German out-
fit is stronger than it Was, certain Russian
ships have been added to it and some more
vessels built. Anyhow the naval and mili-
tary commands are under one control, which
suggests things. If the Hun makes a heroic
dash it is admitted —everything being pos-
sible and the chapter of accidents being long
—that he might score some kind of victory
and put a new complexion on things. At
the worst he could only lose some ships
which, if he loses the war through not mak-
ing every possible dash, will probably be
lost in any case. Also he would lose some
men, but if he lost the lot it wouldn’t be
worse than what happened to him in Lor-
raine early in September, 1914. It was the
Allies’ first big victory, and it was the first
occasion when the Kaiser came out to watch
the triumph—and there were 40.000 good
dead Huns on the slopes of the Grand
Couronnd, where the annoyance was thick-
est and the incivility most marked.
Michael Ford, who died lately at Leich-
hardt (Sydney), arrived in Australia in
1532 and, with his father and brother,
started engineering works at Geelong (Vic.).
He had a hand in building the first coach
that ran from Geelong to the Ballarat
diggings. Later he was Topin, Angus and
Smith’s head engineer when that firm con-
structed the Sydney water-supply works.
Maorilander “Timi” Carroll has been a
member of Parliament over yonder for 31
years continuously. For an elective
Assembly it is probably a record. Carroll
spent over 20 of these years as a member
of consecutive Ministries under Ballance.
Seddon and Ward. All this prevalence has
been mainly the result of having a mel-
lifluous tongue ami a personal popularity
epitomised in being “Jimmy” to everybody.
He is 61 now. and bears a knighthood with
the same fortitude that he shouldered the
prolonged portfolio.
“Pons”: Medical men have discovered
quite by accident that the Minister of Health
proposes to enlarge the remote, windswept
Coast Hospital (X.S.W.). The object of
additions (all new buildings, by the way) is
to provide bed-space for 500 returned sol-
diers. the same •to be admitted in seven
months. It looks risky, not to say stupid.
Expensive equipment, almost unobtainable
in any case, wflll be required; and even with
the show in working order not many' first-
rate doctors have time to go out to the
“Coast” two or three times a week. Then,
soldiers’ relatives are not a wealthy class,
and fares to Long Bay come high. If the-
Minister’s plan is adopted it means inferior
treatment, huge expense and general growl.
Why not send the soldiers to the admirable
city hospitals? Sydney and the Royal Prince
Alfred are well-equipped, staffed by the best
of Macquarie-street, directed by business
men of standing, and handy to visitors and
students. These two hospitals can admit the
500 military cases within four mouths by
enlarging certain existing wards, and as botli
serve a large industrial district the new
accommodation will be needed by the civil
•population within a few years.

The new musical comedy at Her Majesty s
(Melb.) is founded on a French farce in
which the oh-ohness of Delphine was proba-
bly more marked than it appears in Ivan
Caryll’s musical piece. In this case rose-
tinted suggestion is tempered by British
propriety, and a certain indeliniteness waits
on both. Moreover, the manner of Gladys
Moncrieff in the name-part carries no double
meaning with it. The songstress has im-
proved considerably in her gait and deport-

ment, and her speaking voice is. almost as
effective as her warble, but the spirit of diab-
lerie is not in her, nor does her vivacity ever
run to abandon. Roberts, made up to look
beauteous as the oil-painting he. carries
around with him on military duty, is about
as fairly successful as Miss Moncrieff in a
grateful part, and Phil Smith plays a genu-
inely droll character with unobtrusive
humor. .Smith gets a majority of 'many
bright lines in a show which has no decided
centre of interest. “Delphine,” for the most
part, is a means to a spectacular end. The
dressing is excellent, and the gaiety of the
chorus, the grouping of the six artist s
models in the first act. and the beauty of the
staging in Acts 2 and 3 should give the
show a chance of favorable comparison with
“Katinka.” Florence Young, condemned to
patter in Persian, scores heavily with her
share in a Venus duet towards the end of
the long proceedings, a number strongly
reminiscent of the Pink Lady waltz. Olive
Godwin is occasionally prominent in song
and dialogue; Ralston, who continues to
roll his words affectedly, is a useful “feeder”
to Roberts and others; George Welch is a
stereotyped Colonel Ginger: and Addie Len-
nard plays a terrible, but entirely super-
fluous. mother-in-law for all the part is
worth. Kitty Downes and Cyril Rite-hard
introduce an acrobatic dance that is clever in
a dangerous way. For the rest, there is the
splendidly efficient chorus, and an impression
of a superabundance of material in the enter-
tainment. A little pruning will develop its
strength and familiarity with the graceful
music will make it popular.
Melbourne by this time is pretty freely
informed re the identity of the murderer of
Spencer Lee, so the departure of “The
Thirteenth Chair” from the Royal on Friday
will leave no itching curiosity in the public
mind. After the spook-drama comes “Oh,
Boy!” Years have passed into the melting-
pot of bygones since musical comedy was pro-
duced at the Royal, and the change of fare
will, be an “event.”

A week of “Honi
Soit,” at the Tivoli
(Me lb.), has
brought, no curtail-
ment of that some-
times tedious revue.
Some of the items
in “lioni Soit” never would be missed if
they were cast on the scrapheap. For in-
stance, “The Bedouin Girl,” by Fred Monu-
ment and chorus, and the tail-end of the
Venice scene, which might as well end where
Marie Baton throws a rose to the Gondolier.
The burlesque on the spook-drama clamors
for reconstruction, and Life in Gaol stretches
far beyond the span that ought to be allotted
it. Also one verse of the Willow Fan song
should be cut out, considering that the
singer’s enunciation is not nearly so satis-
factory as her voice. And. generally speak-
ing. a little less Lupino would be a little more
to The Bulletin’s liking. In an unduly
prolonged show the leading man happens top
much and too frequently. He should reduce
liis ration of fat and practise the acrobatic
art of sitting on himself.
Alexander Watson is happening rather un-
expectedly at the Athenamm Hall (Melb.)
this week. Delay in getting to Maoriland
gave the opportunity, and Melbourne’s in-
satiable appetite for Watson recitals was
the reason for a few more farewells. Last

knew of Lalo’s “Symphonique Espagnole”
and subsequently was the medium of a dis-
tinguished rendering of the well-known
“Zigeunerweisen” and a couple of other
things. J. J. Bailey’s Metropolitan Choir
attacked several part songs and an
effect of volume discreetly controlled. Con-
tralto Lilian Gibson had all the vocal re-
sources for “My Heart Is Weary,” from
Goring Thomas’s “Nadeschda,” and she
nobly warbled a new love song in the
infatuated language of a poetic office-boy.
Elsy Treweek's efforts included “Ah, fors e
lui,” from “Traviata,” and all she lacked
for complete success was the requisite
warmth of voice and temperament. Of the
two male songsters, tenor Edwin Hooke and
baritone Fred Collier, the latter in one
number commanded a wee doggie to go to
sleep. Yet Fred is big enough to discourse
lullabies to an elephant or a lion.
Elinor Glyn’s “Reason Why” is catching
the small silver of the populace at the
Britannia (Melb.) this week. The author’s
name promised well, but the film is emo-
tionally disappointing. Only Clara Kim-
ball Young’s histrionic brilliancy atones in
a measure for the arid patches of the story.
At the Melba Ethel Clayton revolts against
a brutal hubby in a World five-reeler,
“Journey’s End.” The subject is hackneyed,
but Miss Clayton’s work is often momentous.
“Keys of the Righteous,” at Hoyt’s De
Luxe (Melb.), this week gives Enid Bennett
a chance to show her capacity as a moral
reformer. Enid has to tear a thirsty father
away from his favorite bunghole. and she
affects the ‘ rescue with the sang-froid of a
Saly’army slummeh Those who saw Jack
Bickford in his former version of Tom Saw-
yer will enjoy a further instalment that
introduces Huckleberry Finn. ‘Thick and
Tom,” which is also running at the Lyceum,
maintains the great good humor of Mark
Twain without hampering the precious per-
sonality of the juvenile lead. At the same
house Virginia Pearson sweeps into view as
“A Daughter of France,” in the part of a
Hun officer’s mash, but her implacable virtue
is none the worse for her dubious company.
A Melb. side-show :
The Victorian Artists’ Spring Show seems another
artistic conspiracy to banish light from our vision.
There is very little honest sunshine apparent, except
in the work of a couple of water-colorists like Harold
Herbert, yet even he has mislaid the recipe for his
golden afternoons. 1 lis two subjects, “Sunlit Road,”
and “The Farm,” are significant for their suppressed
glare and their unconvincing suavity. F. G. Reynolds
strikes the keynote of the show with a “Foggy Morn-
ing, lleyington,” which entirely obscures Heyington
and leaves a lot of morning to the imagination.
Dolafield Cook follows suit with “The Haunt of the
Blue Crane,” a dim evening effect that the late
Ford Paterson might have painted in a fit of the gout.
C Hampel’s “Frosty Morning” gives the eye chil-
blains, though tlier? is a sportive flippancy of treat-
ment which suggests that his intention is glad if his
color is depressing. There is almost a whole wall
of this arctic painting in the South Gallery, but the
shivering critic gets a chance to warm himself in
the comparatively lurid pastels of Miss Dora Wilson
and the lively sketches of Miss 11. Irvine. The latter
Frenchy impressionist tries hard to rob the rainbow
which George Dancey annexed for a florid panel of
The Crucifixion. George vamps up a color scale
from sage-green to salmon-pink and achieves some-
thing like a pictorial oratorio. Among the por-
traitists are two —A. E. Newbury and Mary Cecil
Allen —who prodigally use vermilion to give
exclamatory expression to their indecisive art. Miss
Allen’s portrait, however, is the careful work of an
unpretentious student, whereas Newbury’s mannered
lady in scarlet might he the forced effort of a man
who thinks himself a “movement.” Still another
self-portrait comes from Leslie Wilkie, whose canvas
reveals his defeated purpose. Harry B. Harrison has
his usual set of relations and friends marked by
every valuable quality except the evidence of a
temperament. Tom Carter’s Study (No. 23) will
probably cause a diplomatic rupture with his model.
F. G. Reynolds’s head of L. L. Politzer is better,
but on account of his iridescent high lights he is
hound to be excommunicated by the Potboilers’
Union. Gena Thomson is a. water-colorist, who works
with some recognition of the value of tones, but
there are other landscapists present who will never
emulate Constable. The most conscientious work is
contributed by black-and-white designers, like Mis 3
Christian Yandell and Miss Callaway, and the still-
life specialists. Unfortunately there is a depressing
sameness about the still-life section.
Amateur work has been prominent in
Adelaide shows lately. At one patriotic con-
cert a brilliant performance of the fantasy,
“A Maker of Dreams,” was given by Wilfred
Neill, Ronald Simpson and Kittv Sullivan.
At another, Mr. and Mrs. Percy Trevor gave
a brisk new playlet, “Dinner Here.” At a
crowded and very costly house at the Royal
there was some really good dancing and
pageant work by a host of clever non-pro-
fessionals. The liighly-original scenery of
Frank Williams was prominent in this. His
brush got a further chance in “Samples, ’
which the Tivoji has suddenly opened up
after two years of successful Andersonian
melodrama. The King’s reopened with
“Look Who’s Here.” which Jack Waller,
presenting it, calls a “merry musical
cocktail.” The mixed bill at the Majes-
tic is much as before, with the addition of
F. 0.8. and Partner. This show ends with
a kind of revue, styled by Ue Blanc a "helter-
skelter of happiness.” In pictures, Farnum,
at the Royal, is powerful in "The Miser-
ables,” and Bill Hart, at Wondergraph, is
strong in the quite-modern “Wolves of the
Rail.” At West’s, Norma Talmadge and
Alma Rubens are the stars of the moment;
but for Australians there should be more
draw in the careful series of pictures of the
new railway from Port Augusta to Ival-
goorlie. The Pav. tackles a problem of
heredity, asking pathetically how a man may
know his own child. If the Pav. solves the
problem the rush for the patent rights will
break all records. The Town Hall also
is about to butt into the profitable picture
business.
The most remarkable side-show in Adel-
aide is the war tank, out at Unley Oval.
The motor trades did a large and plucky
thing in financing an early visit to S.A. of
this monster. It gives demonstrations every
afternoon and evening of its knack of climb-
ing over things and destroying them if they
are less solid than a mound of earth. The
privilege of riding inside the tank, at £lO
a trip, is bringing in large sains for lied
Cross and repatriation funds.
“S’NIGE,” AT SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Eve Kelland captivating Lieutenant Arbuton
(Leslie 1 (laze).
“High Jinks,” revived to a big house on
Saturday, ends a live-nights sprint this
(Thursday) evening at Her Majesty’s (Syd-
ney). Maude Fane being out of the cast
through tonsilitis, Cecil Bradley took over
her part of Sylvia Dale, and got through
with honors, scoring a triple encore with her
chief song. She is always appealingly femi-
nine in her acting. Madge Elliott in turn
skipped into Miss Bradley’s place as the
dancer Chi Chi. Her voice is a trifle small,
but she managed it cleverly, and when it
came to dancing (lie audience refused to let
her go. Incidentally, it is very pleasant to
hear tin l loud welcome an Australian audi-
ence gives an understudy; both these girls
were heartened for their evening’s work as
though everyone in the house knew them
personally.
The Invaluable Family are At Home to
all Sydney at the Palace with “Gran’dad
Rudd.” For the sake of playgoers who are
slow off the mark, it better be mentioned
that Hmelie Polini takes possession of the
Pitt-street homestead on Saturday, Septem-
ber 21, with “The Invisible Foe.”
The management notifies that some new
ingredients have been poured into “S’Nice,”
at the Tivoli (Sydney). There’s sugar and
spice there already, but a chief comedian
dropped in would improve it greatly. Still
it goes pretty well.
It is “Pierrot Pie No. 3” that Sydney
.Tames is carving at the Playhouse (Sydney),
next to the Fire Brigade’s headquarters an
Castlereagh-street. Someone asserts that
“P. P. No. 3” even cures Spanish influenza,
or whatever the curse is that is devastating
the city. “Pie No. 4” (a revue dish) will
be bumped on the table on Friday, Septem-
ber 20, and may be recommended as a cure
for gout, insolvency, old age and that empty
feeling after rations.
No doubt it was the management’s belief
that good wine needs no bush that caused
“The Vicar of Wakefield” to be given so little
prominence in the Lyceum “write-ups.”
However, Sir John Hare breathes the spirit
of the gentle Dr. Primrose even through
the movie-screen, and this great play of
human emotions will be acted all the week
with charm and subtlety of repression in-
stead of the over-emotion that screen-acting
has accustomed us to. The headliners at the
theatre are those two clever children, Jane
and Katharine, the “American Buds.” Their
acting is remarkable while they unmask
an Austrian spy, find two fathers (tempo-
rarily) and a grandfather permanently. It’s
good going while the reel unwinds. Madge
Kennedy is having a honeymoon with “the
boys” and letting the Strand audiences into
the joke. Hoyt’s picture-man says, “You’ve
wondered where Enid Bennett was?” and
then pi’oceeds to expose the poor child’s
secret in “The Keys of the Righteous.” Enid
has been busy reclaiming a prodigal father,
but The Bulletin doesn’t hold with pub-
licity of family secrets. The long, long
lingering kiss is to be found at the Crystal
Palace. Ethel Clayton has it during
“Stolen Hours.”
Muriel Starr starts at the Cri. (Sydney)
on Saturday with “The Man Who Came
Back.” Potash and Perlmutter shift up the
road to Her Majesty’s on “Business Before
Pleasure.”
OH O[?] DELPHENE!!!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At Brest, in France, where conscripts comb to drill
for twenty days,
A giddy Colonel works his will in wondrous winning
ways,
And all the men who struggle hard their humor, to
enforce
(The all-important joker-card is Philip Smith, of
course),
Get tangled up, as each arrives,
With one another’s wayward wives,
Who’ve varied their domestic lives with marriage and
divorce.
And girls in red, and blue, and green,
Make beautiful the festive scene,
Come morning, afternoon, or e’en.
What 0 I Delphine !
Keg Roberts is an artist spry, who travels with a
suite
Oi models who are nice as pie, and plump enough, to
eat;
A Persian dame is Florence Young (or p raps a
Persian maid)
Attempting in a foreign tongue to push the carpet
trade;
1 And Olive Godwin plainly thinks
That Gladys Moncrieff is a. minx,
And chorus girls in mauve and pinks, and otherwise
arrayed,
Are gloriously bright and keen
To fill the spaces in between
, The coming joke, and what has been.
What 0 1 Delphine !
Three gorgeous scenes support the plot, and someone
gives a ball.
Whereat is a delightful lot of ladies large and small;
The music has an easy swing, the , colored lights are
low
When sentimental lovers sing their, loves of long ago.
And, if the talk lacks interest,
The poet soothes his weary breast
With thoughts of angels, lightly dressed, disporting
to and fro.
Oh, tinted hose of silken sheen !
Oil, amber, rose and white sateen!
Oh, ripened charms and sweet sixteen !
Oh! Oh!! Delphine!!!-

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Shareholders of both the National Bank
of Australasia and the Colonial Bank ot
Australasia having unanimously agreed to
the amalgamation scheme already given in
detail on this page (B. 29/8/’18), the new
National Bank will commence operations
with a paid-capital of £2,000,000, and with
visible reserves of over £l,OOO/000. apart
from the surplus profits of both banks for
the current term. What internal reserves
the new bank will have is, of course, not
disclosed; but it is understood that in the
case of the National, at least, there is sub-
stantial provision for contingencies. Of
the Colonial, National chairman John Grice
told his shareholders that they were taking
over “a thoroughly sound and in every way
desirable business.” If the new National
holds on to all the business of both the old
banks it will have over 184 millions of
deposits. Combining the present figures,
for every £1 of the shareholders’ funds tjie
amalgamated banks will hold about £6 15s.
of the public’s money ; and liquid assets will
represent about 45 p.c. of the total liabilities.
The nosition is thus very strong. Colonial
chairman Bowes Kelly and F. G. Clarke join
the new National Board, the other three
(Colonial directors splitting £2OOO between
them when they say their farewells. The
benediction of the Vie. Supreme Court and
a confirmatory meeting of shareholders will
| complete the arrangement, and the new
National will probably begin its career
almost immediately.

Brewery profits are not what they used to
be; but considering our four years' participa-
tion in the greatest and most;.: expensive war
in history, they are remarkably good. This is
entirely due to the fact that the stay-at-
homes, instead of being bard hit. by the
catastrophe, have been having a gay time on
the loans that the Federal and State
Governments have been splashing around,
i So though 30 hours a week have been
chipped off the N. S. Wales pubs’ best trading
hours by six-o’clock closing, and despite the
loss of custom by enlistments, the consump-
tion of beer has dropped only about 8 p.c.
in N. S. Wales since 1914. But while the
1 loss of trade has not been serious, expenses
have been climbing, as will be seen from this
comparison of some of the Standard Brew-
ery’s figures : —-
Half-year- Gross Rents Wages, Charges
ending Profit on and and Management
.Trrlv, Brewings. Interest. Exes.
1914 ..'£77,035 £9,021 £5.3,696
1915 .. 94,635 10,139 72,260
1916 .. 90,432 9,798 74,026
1917 .. 82,197 8,420 66,594
1918 .. 101,788 8,741 51,724
So, whereas in 1914 exes, absorbed 70 p.c. of
the gross profit on brewings, they now take
an 80 p.c. cut. To meet the increased excise
duties and costs, selling prices have been
lifted during the past year, but apparently
the added income has barely more than
covered the increased costs. Nevertheless,
the co. can still pay the S p.c. dividend with
ease.
How the balance-sheet figures have moved
since the war is shown in this comparison:—
1914. 1918.
Liabilities .. .. .. £90,590 £93,214
Breweries, hotels and plant 390,675 388,659
Stocks . . . . . . 78.322 171,453
Book debts 172,921 134,250
Cash.. 2,610 12,597
Thus, after paying the 8 p.c. div., making
additions to plant and maintaining it “in a
high state of efficiency,” the surplus of more
or less liquid assets over liabilities has in-
creased from £163,262 four years ago to
£225,085 as at July 31 last. Toohey’s has.
therefore, not suffered much as a of
war conditions. But the future of beer is
still quite obscure, and the investor appar-
ently fancies the prospects even less than he
d.d six months ago. Anyhow, the co.’s 16s.
shares, which were being bought at 275. four
years ago, had dropped to 18s. six months
ago and to under 16s. lately.

Walkers, Ltd., had its beginnings away back
in 1864, when John Walker started works in
Ballarat (Vic.) to capture the goldfields
engineering work that was going to Mel-
bourne. The enterprise proved successful,
and in addition to Ballarat a dozen other
fields went to Walker’s for their engineering
necessities. The Gympie gold discoveries
.took the firm to Queensland, where it was
discovered there were also fine opportunities
,to cater for the sugar industry. In 1868
work was started at Maryborough ; and by
1879 the old Ballarat business had passed
into other hands and the four partners had
made Maryborough their headquarters. In
1884 the business was floated into a co. with
a capital of £75,000. Last year the co. lost
by death managing-director W. F. Harring-
ton. who had devoted over half a century
to building up the show. Walkers, Ltd.,
nowadays has grown into a big concern, and
besides specialising in locomotives—it is
supplying engines for the Transcontinental —
it lias set out to build four 5500-ton steamers
for the Commonwealth.
Though this pioneering co. has been a
success and has built up a fine reputation
for its work —and incidentally been a great
advertisement for Australian industry and
helped to kill prejudice against the locally-
made article—-it is not as big a concern as it
should be after all the years it has been in
business. That, however, is not the direc-
tors’ fault; it has been all due to political
mismanagement. Instead of having dozens
of cos. like Walkers, Ltd., all over the con-
tinent, the local foundries have had practi-
cally no encouragement from the tariff-
shirkers. The past eight years have, how-
ever, been very good, and another view of
the progress is shown by this comparison of
the cash position :
1908. 1917. 1918.

In the 10 years the book value of fixed assets
has increased from £51,732 to £73,350. The
assets other than freeholds and plant, men-
tioned above, consist of £56,306 in cash and
investments, £46,700 representing work done
on contract but not completed, £25,873 in
stock, and £7361 owing by sundry debtors.
Paid capital is £124.193.

The Equity Board has lost two of its old
directors during the past year—Edward
Fanning, director for 30 years and chairman
for 22 years, died, and Sir Wm. Irvine
dropped out when he became Vic. Chief Jus-
tice. A lawyer, Sir Edward Mitchell, K.C.,
and a politician, Capt. Stanley Bruce. M.C.,
member for Flinders in the Reps., fill the
vacancies. The Equity is one of the trustee
cos. which do not disclose the value of trust
estates administered. In this case, there-
fore, it is only poss’ble to guess the progress
by comparing the growth of profits. But as
profits are somewhat erratic the best plan
is to take two five-year periods. For the
five years to the end of December, 1913,
profits averaged £28,400 each half-year; for
the past five years the average has been
£44,700. That ind’eates that there has been
a very fine growth of business. Another
view of the progress the co. has made in
the past 10 years is shown by this compari-
son :
June, ’OB. Dec., ’l7. June, ’IS.
Liquid assets ..£26,229 £45,473 £47,410
Other assets .. 23,072 32,747 32,065
Liabilities .. 98 Nil Nil
The “other assets” are now made up of
£15,962 in premises. £15,722 owing by sun-
dry debtors, and £3Bl in furniture, written
down to about one-fifth of cost. So in 10
years, besides paying handsome dividends,
£21,279 of cash has been piled up and £8993'
has been added to other assets. How fat
the present dividend is may be judged from
the fact that of the present paid capital of
£50,000, no less than half of it is represented
by reserves capitalised a couple of yeaf-s ago.

These are uncertain times, and no doubt this
36-years-old Monte de lTet6 eo. is viewing
new advances with a very cautious eye. The
banks have practically shut down on
advances for speculative purposes, and since
nobody can forecast the future with any
degree of certainty, this co.’s management
is making dead sure of its security before
placing shareholders’ funds, and doubtless
also charging a little more than formerly to
cover the extra risks. Anyhow, four years
ago “advances on mortgages, pledges and
other securities, and other assets” totalled
£140,540 and earned £13,630 for the co.,
equal to almost 9.7 p.c. for the six months.
At June 30 last advances, etc., War Loan
a>.id cash on deposit totalled £138,165, giving
a gross income of £14,741, or a return of
10.6 p.c. for the half-year. How much is
in War Loan and in cash on deposit is
not shown.
Nowadays the co. is risking practically
nothing but its own money. Four years ago
it was working on a bank overdraft of
£10,470, had fixed deposits totalling £3166
and owed sundry creditors £535; total,
£14,171. Now its liabilities amount to only
£3066. The capital of £112,500 (100,000
shares fully paid to £1 and 25,000 £i shares
paid to 10s.) and the reserves are repre-
sented by the £138,165 of advances, etc.,
War Loan and deposits, £20,942 in freeholds
and leaseholds, £8625 in cash and £SS6 in
office furniture.

The reconstruction of the B. 11. Prop, is
proceeding on the basis agreed to by share-
holders in June last, and the issue of 1 the
318,994 unissued shares has been completed.
All that remains now is for the bonus shares
to be allotted. The old subscribed capital
consisted of 1.181,006 shares of Bs. each, =
£472,402, and the authorised capital
1,500,000 shares of 8s each, = £600,000. The
new capital is £3,000,000, made up in this
way:—
Present 1,181,006 shares of Bs. . . . . £472,402
318,994 new Bs. shares (premium 325.) 127,598
Bonus of 12s. per share on 1,500,000 shares 900,000
Bonus of 600,000 new £1 shares .. 600,000
Shares held in reserve .. .. .. 900,000
£3,000,000
By this means the co. gets in £637,988 of new
capital, with which it can further extend its
Newcastle iron and steel works. To com-
plete the scheme a million and a half of
reserves are being capitalised, the reserve
fund at present standing at £1,895,000, while
there is a P. and L. balance of £476,571. So
far as shareholders are concerned, the new
arrangement means that the holder of every
100 Bs. shares receives 140 £1 shares. In-
cidentally, owing to the amount of labor
necessitated in producing the half-yearly re-
ports, the accounts in future are to be
presented only once a year.
At the mine 79.34 S tons were raised com-
pared with 55.316 during the previous half,
which was affected by the big strike, and
103,922 tons for the similar term of last
year. However, the Prop, has been getting
such fine prices for its products that, with
the profits from its iron and steel works, the
figures for the term exceed those in any
other shown in the table. During the half-
year no work was dona below the 1200 ft.
level except pumping, etc., the lower levels
having been flooded during last year’s strike.
The mine is gradually being worked out, and
further exploratory work at IOOOft. and
1300 ft. has revealed nothing of importance.
Ore is now being extracted from above the
400 ft. level, in the old 1000 fire area, where
it is stated “the ground is gradually cooling
off.” The mills put through 70,843 tons ore
and produced 11,958 tons concentrates assay-
ing 00.55 p.c. lead and 29.140 z. silver. The
zinc plant handled 144.044 tons tailings pro-
ducing 36,030 tons concentrates. The Brad-
ford slimes flotation plant Ims proved a
great success, and treated a record tonnage,
43,074 tons of the 73,001 tons handled com-
ing from tlii' dumps; and from this were
produced 8101 lead concentrates assaying
6(;.4 p.c. lead and 83.440 z. silver per ton,
and 19,203 tons zinc concentrates assaying
50 p.c. zinc.
The co.'s main interest is now in the iron
and steel works at Newcastle. where
£2.845,400 has been spent on plant, etc.
During the past half-year altogether
£283,292 was expended on construction, and
all but £2400 was on the steel works. The
total working expenditure for the term was
£1,102,557, and no less than £820,000-odd
was charged to iron and steel. A second
blast furnace has been almost completed,
and is held up pending the arrival of blow-
ing machinery./ A smaller furnace, callable
ot 100 tons pig per day, is now in commis-
sion, and will help considerably to relieve
the shortage of foundry iron in Australia.
General-manager Delprat is certainly making
things move at Newcastle. Here is a brief
record of the half-year’s output:—
Blast Furnace. —07,803 tons pig iron were pro-
duced, compared with 41,351 for the previous term.
Open Hearth. —The production of steel ingots
amounted to 89,011 tons.
Blooming Mill. —The tonnage of ingots rolled was
91,480 tons. Over 1000 tons of plates were rolled,
20 feet long by 5 feet wide, down to a thickness of
1-inch with the existing housings. To roll thinner
plates of this size requires solid steel housings, and
these have been east and are now being machined.
Their weight is about 40 tons each, and are the
heaviest steel eastings that have been made in Aus-
tralia. When they are in position it is expected that
plates down to 1-inch thickness can be rolled.
Rail Mi 11. —47,380 tons of rails, 59 tons of small
plates and 5937 tons of structural steel were pro-
duced, a total of 53,376 tons, as compared with
34,474 tons for the previous term.
Sufficient structural material for six ships was
rolled and delivered.
18-inch Merchant Mill. —The quantity of small
sections rolled in this mill was 15,320 tons, consist-
ing of light rails, billets, fish-plates, bars, flats arid
angles, compared with 7461 tons for the previous
half-year.
12-inch and 8-inch Merchant Mill. —Light section
rounds, squares, flats and angles amounting to 5731
tons were produced. The output from these mills
will increase as the workmen become more skilled
in their various duties.
Fish-plate Plant. —The fish-plates corresponding
to the rails supplied were made in this plant, the
total production being 2151 tons.
Steel Foundry. —The new steel foundry has proved
of immense benefit for erection work, as well as for
current requirements for the existing plants, and
the building has been extended during the half-year.
It is self-contained with its own steel furnace, and
the tonnage of castings amounted to 1840 tons.
Iron Foundry. —During the half-year the Direct
Metal Foundry has cast 1745 tons of iron castings,,
mostly ingot moulds.
Since the report was issued the rod mill,,
for drawing wires, has commenced work. In
every respect it is it great achievement.
Standard Rubber Co. of Selangor, Ltd.
(Sydney) : —This co. holds 1193 acres of
perpetual leasehold near Kuala Lumpur.
Federated Malay States. It commenced
operations eight years ago, and has 792
acres planted, 632 acres of which are under
tapping. A further 315 acres are on the
planting programme for the current year.
For t*e 12 months to March 31 last
210,2601 b. of rubber were produced, and the
estimate for this year is 240,0001 b. The
co. is now manufacturing its own smoked
rubber sheets, and has thus effected a further
saving in costs. Rubber sales returned
£19.300 for the year, and after allowing for
working and management exes, a net profit
of £4037 was earned. From this £2381 was
paid in dividends on the 12 p.c. cum. pref.
shares, leaving, with the balance of £2512
from the. previous year, £4168 to carry for-
ward. Subscribed capital is £44,548, in
27.751 ords. paid to £l, 2501 ords. paid to
175., 12,501 12 p.c. cum. prefs. paid to £l,,
and a further 2499 prefs. called up to 17s.
All other liabilities amount to only £1462.
To date £45,542 has been spent on the co.’s
estates, there are stocks valued at £2703 and
liquid assets totalling £1032. The curtail-
ment of TJ.S. rubber imports and the scarcity
of shipping have affected the rubber market,,
but this co.’s directors are quite cheerful
about the future. They point out that the
demand for rubber is growing rapidly, and
that the value of the TJ.S. manufacture of
rubber goods last year was £120.000,000, just
double the figures for 1914.

The approach of summer makes it imperative for
every stock-owner to give a thought to the purifica-
tion of drinking- water for his stock. If he is content
to let them drink muddy, slimy water he cannot
expect them to keep in good condition. All over the
State careful stock-owners are using Aluminoferric in
the proportion of one pound to every 2000 gallons of
water. It ensures pure liquid water in dams, wells,
tanks, etc., at very low cost, by precipitating all
impurities and leaving the water clear and pure,
free from any ingredient injurious to man or beast.

Things are looking up at old Hill End
(X.S.W.), which is now enjoying State
patronage in an effort at general revival.
The latest crushing from the Mica reef
by the tributors in the Amalgamated mine
resulted in 149 ounces gold from 49 tons. An
improvement is also recorded at the Haw-
kins Hill Deej) Levels mine, which is really
part of the old Amalgamated, 51 ounces
coming from the fortnight’s run. The dis-
coveries that Geologist Harper, of the Mines
Department, has just made on the field,
revives the heated argument about the
nature of the country—whether the reefs are
of saddle formation or fissure. W. H. Cundy,
of Bendigo, who completed the previous sur-
vey, held strongly to the saddle formation,
arguing that the east and west reefs on
which the energies of the past have been
concentrated were merely the exposed legs of
the saddles. That is why he described the
operations generally as the crudest he knew
of. Cundy reckoned that the quartz was
resting in the folds that danced all over the
leases, and drew almost complete parallels
with the Bendigo field. Harper believes in
the fissure formation, and the improved
yields which have resulted from his
suggestions go to back up his belief.
Acting on his advice, the Reward
searched for makes of quartz along the con-
tact zone of the two formations, “as the
evidence throughout the field pointed to the
probability of rich makes along the junction.”
Crosscuts were put in from the 229 ft. and
350 ft. levels and proved the contention.
* * * *
Abercrombie, Burraga (N.S.W.), is now
down to 40 hands, instead of the usual 150,
owing to the expiration of the Imperial
copper contract and the uncertainty of the
future. An argument centres round the
question whether (lie new six months’ con-
tract will require the smelting and delivery
of the product by the end of the year. In
the case of Burraga, stone has to be broken
two months before the results can be bagged.
Meanwhile the co. is mining further ore,
which will not be treated until selling pros-
pects brighten.
* * * i *
The Electrolytic Refining and Smelting
Co., Port Kembla (N.S.W.), has extended its
operations to the manufacture of copper
sulphate (bluestone). Experiments were
started shortly after the outbreak of war,
and although the plant is not yet complete,
owing to the difficulty of obtaining material,
a contract has been secured for the supply
of bluestone to the Commonwealth Postal
Department for 12 months, and also to the
Victorian railways. Supplies from England
have dwindled since the war, but that wide-
awake ally, Japan, has made up the defici-
ency. The Electrolytic Co. says that it can
supply all the needs of the Commonwealth
with a first-class article.

Things continue brisk at the recently-born
township of Ivandos, on the Mudgee line,
where the New South Wales Lime, Coal
and Cement Co., Ltd., and the C-S.A. are
spending close on half a million in plant and
general improvements. The X. S. Wales
Lime has nearly 300 men at work, and has
expended about £300,000 during its five
years’ operations. Suspension of labor
conditions has been granted with respect to
an outlying lease that is being held to pre-
serve the continuity of the coal deposit.
This is about 54 miles from the general
works, and a tunnel is being driven in its
direction, timed to link up in three years.
A feature of the co.’s show is the 31 miles
of aerial railway running from the works
to the limestone deposit, reckoned to be about
the most up to date in the Commonwealth.
The enlarged plant is now equal to double
the previous output. The co. takes out more
coal than it needs for itself, and is selling
the surplus to the public. Over 1100 people
are now on the field, as against two
cockies five years ago. The C.S.A. is push-
ing ahead with the erection of the refining
and electolytic works, and has arranged for
coal and water for the treatment of the ore,
which is to be brought from Cobar, via
Mudgee.

Cock’s Pioneer, Eldorado (Vic.), against
liabilities of £4297 shows £22,791 of assets,
most of which are cash items. Under the
Collins House control the show has paid
£30,000 in divs., or practically the whole of
the capital cost of plant and buildings. No.
1 paddock was responsible for nine runs,
during which 1.086,000 cub. yards were
treated for 996540 z. gold and 129 tons tin
concentrates. No. 2 paddock yielded
13,643| oz. gold and 194 tons tin oxide from
1,250,000 cub. yards. Last half-year 371,000
cub. yards of this material were handled
for 9.57 d. per cub. yard, so that charges were
the same as for the last half of 1917,
although timber and supplies went up in
price all round. Falconer has now got his
dredge going in No. 3 paddock, which, he
says, prospects as well as No. 2. So the
prediction is for another profitable half-
vear’s work.

Great Boulder’s decision to pass the usual
September dividend came as an unpleasant
surprise to shareholders, though the fact that
for the past two years dividends have ex-
ceeded earnings must have been sufficient
warning of the inevitable. In break-
ing the news at the annual meeting
in London on June 25 chairman G. P.
Doolette said that the balance in hand
was about £9909 more than was re-
quired to pay one dividend; but as there was
a doubt about the present year’s output
yielding the full 3s. per share, the Board
considered it best in shareholders’ interests
to wait until December next before making
another distribution. Moreover, they wanted
to have plenty of cash in hand in case a
promising new property was sighted. To date
Great Boulder had distributed £5,400,550 in
dividends. It started off with £48,000 in
1895, and by 1903 it was paying out
£262,500 per annum. The disbursements for
the next two years averaged £284.375, and
since then it had distributed £262,500 per
annum, equal to 3s. a share, without a break.
Last year portion of the Kalgoorlie Golden
Mile was shaken by a mysterious explosion
which rent and displaced the ground in
various places. A request by the Miners’
Union for a Royal Commission to inquire
into the matter was followed by a report
from State mining-engineer Montgomery,
who advanced several theories as to the
cause of the disturbance but did’ not defi-
nitely define its origin. The union not
satisfied with this report, and again pressed
for a Royal Commission. The Government
wouldn’t agree to the proposal, but, realis-
ing that an independent investigation by
some recognised authority was necessary,
arranged with J. B. Jaquet, chief mines in-
spector in N. S. Wales, to make an examina-
tion. Jaquet is now on the spot, and has
been asked to report (1) as to the best
method or methods of mining on the field,
and (2) whether there is anything in the
yarn that a general collapse of workings
along the “Mile” is likely to happen.
The Mararoa circular concerning the pur-
chase of the Light of Asia, Cue (W.A.), is
so decidedly frigid in tone that it admini-
stered a k.o. to the bulls. First it said that
the Mararoa itself “is nearing exhaustion.”
True, indeed. Next, that the purchase, if
carried through, will mop up £8999 of cash
“extending over a period of 12 months, dur-
ing which time it is anticipated satisfactory
returns from crushings will be received.”
Most directors would have stopped there,
but not so the Mararoa Board. They go on:
“It will also be necessary to take into con-
sideration the possibility of calls being made
until the mine is placed on a payable foot-
ing.” And then some people wonder why the
market got cold feet.
Some Westralian mine-managers are stren-
uously urging the Government to tackle the
liquor question on the goldfields. Booze,
they state, is seriously affecting the effici-
ency of labor. Great Boulder Hamilton and
others are pressing for war-time prohibition
as ait experiment. They assert that the
licensing laws are a dead letter on the gold-
fields. The number of absentees among skilled
workers through over-indulgence of liquor on
the Great Boulder last year for three days
after each pay is given as 10 per cent., and
this left insufficient men to handle the mine.
Similar conditions prevailed on other mines,
and in the case of the Great Fingall opera-
tions “might have been kept going” but for
beer and its “consequent labor inefficiencies.”
The Gwalia beer strike in 1915 is quoted in
support of prohibition. While this strike
lasted both the men and the co. made more
money. A mining co. in the West nowadays
considers itself lucky if no more than 15 p.c.
of its hands fail to turn up to work the day
after pay-day.
The Credo, which in the early days of
Broad Arrow (W.A.), was boomed as a
bonanza, and which produced some thou-
sands of ounces of gold before petering out,
is about to be given another trial. Some
Perth capital has been found to finance the
venture, and an attempt is to be made to try
to pick up at 300 ft. the downward con-
tinuation of the shoot from which the gold
was taken at 200 ft. and above.
Coronet Hill (N.T.) got in £3950 from
the sale of ore ldst year, and took £2071
from the Federal Treasury. Now it owes
the Government £7556 on the security of
5000 shares, against which it shows as
security its mine and £1383 cash. Seemingly
manager Callanan had some difficulty to get
his shipments of 212 tons of ore up to the 20
p.c. grade, for lie states that much of the
stuff mined by him only got to the 12 p.c.
mark. This statement knocks the end out of
the Collins-street yarn, on which shares went
soaring, that there were piles of high-grade
stuff to draw on. Even if there had been, the
fact that it took £1972 to earn £3950 meant
that it was a fool’s game to drag all the
good ore out merely to pay heavy land cart-
age costs. The boom went out of the show
when Director of Mines Oliver got on to the
claim after his trip south. He stipulated at
once that future work must prove the exist-
ence of sulphide ore “at depth in quantity
and of a quality” sufficient to justify the big
expenditure and equipment recommended by
Port Darwin expert Richards six months
ago. This means that the grant of £2OOO,
made by the Federal Government for the
erection of a reverberatory-furnace, is
diverted to sink the south shaft, whence
Oliver’s exploratory programme will be
developed. Of course, £2OOO won’t go far, so
it may be up to Ambrose Pratt and his pals
to do some hard thinking over the problem of
future finance. Work on parallel formations
has opened up only poor stuff, though in the
shaft at the south end of the lease the lode
wide assays 81 p.c. copper and 370 z.
silver per ton. This isn’t bad, but the breaks
in the lode damn the old idea that a con-
tinuous shoot of pay ore runs through the
claim.
* * * *
“Hustle”: Re “Good Australian’s” com-
ment on T. J. Greenway’S Anglo-Persian
Oil Co.’s proposal (B. 5/9/T8). Undoubtedly
the Anglo-Persian made big profits last year
(over £409,000), but as the British Govern-
ment has a two-tliirds shareholding interest
it bagged the bulk of the profits. So, accord-
ing to “Good Australian,” Bull robbed his
own Admiralty to put money into his own
Exchequer till. Seeing that British Govern-
ment nominees dominate the co.’s policy and
regulate its trade, the Anglo-Persian "diver-
sion” can’t be anti-national. Besides, it is-
a purely British concern, and so it has freed
the navy of dependence on outside suppliers.'
Anyway, what proof has “Good Australian”
that: Greenway ever suggested that the Com-
monwealth shouldn’t have its own oil-field,
or that the Australian navy shouldn’t draw
its oil from such a possession? Greenway
might have reason for making such a depar-
ture in view of the cash spent in Papua or
squandered by Private Enterprise on the
oil wastrels bred here so far. But it isn’t
Greenway’s idea to fetter up Papua or the
Australian oil shows away from the
Commonwealth. His plan is to get something
done by the Federal Government to provide
oil at once for the Australian navy and for
the Australian people. If the Anglo-Persian
scheme is to link tip State and private push
it means that his technical knowledge, cash,
a fleet of tanks and a trade connection is
there for the Government to start off with
and to control. The authority “Good Aus-
tralian” has for saying that the Anglo-
Persian isn’t prepared to provide a refinery
is about as reliable as is the inference he
conveys that Australian mining men intend
to develop the Papuan field for the benefit
of the Commonwealth, when the woolly
fleece they want is to be for tllem-
sc-lves. Behind the scenes everyone knows
of the trips made to America and elsewhere
to arrange for the foreigner\ to get control
through cash advances. If anyone’s cash is
to come in I prefer Bull’s, especially in view
of the big prop he has put under every
primary industry here ever since war began.
Why object to allowing him to finance an
oil go. especially when the partnership is
certain to be a Commonwealth-controlled
affair?
* * * *
“L.” : Minister Glynn has definitely refused
to deal with any applications for r'. -its to bore
for oil in Papua outside those ol the Anglo-
Persian Co., and the British Imperial Co.,
both concerns being registered in London.
American applications have been declined
on the ground that “the Government was
not unreasonably giving prior consideration
to a policy which placed British interests
first.” But Mr. Glynn has gone further than
that, and has refused Australian applicants
the right to develop not only the badly-
messed-up Vailala oilfield, but other known
oil areas in Papua. No better reason is
given for blocking Australians going into
Papua to bore than that the two British
oil cos. were already engaged in petroleum
mining, and the Minister did not consider
there was any need to invite new companies
into the field. Why? Not because there is
no room, for Papua covers 90,000 square
miles of country, of which only 100 miles
have been prospected for petroleum. Why
should Australian mining men and Aus-
tralian capital and machinery be specially
excluded from a new Australian industry in
Australian territory?
Analyses of average samples of the phos-
phate deposits on Ilolbourne Island, north
of Bowen (N.Q.), have given as high as 39
p.c. phosphoric acid. A subsidiary co. has
been formed to prepare and market the fer-
tiliser. But it is not intended to convert
the stuff into superphosphates, as stated by
a correspondent recently (B. 22/8/’IS), the
rock being unsuitable for that purpose.

{Died of wouvdx, France, 8/8/’18.)
If the elusive Lenin of Russia is really
dead lie leaves a unique record behind him.
He followed the policy of the most advanced
Australian Laborite to the letter. He
secured “peace by negotiation” and dis-
banded the army and abjured “militarism.”
It wasn’t his responsibility but his folly
that the Hun broke the peace as soon as the
Russian army was dispersed, and ate up the
country. Lenin (who is either dead
or alive) and his crowd repudiated
the public debt, abolished the church, abol-
ished permanent marriage, abolished the
“capitalistic ’ banks, abolished private land-
ownership, abolished titles—in fact the Dic-
tator went the whole I.W.W. hog. * Under
i.is guidance the Russian entered into a
Promised Land of beggary, rags, starvation,
incendiarism, epidemics and slavery—a
paradise where everybody kills his brother
when he feels that way, unless his brother
kills him first, and there is much death-rate
and very little birth-rate. The deceased (if
he is deceased —and if he isn’t The Bulle-
tin can only blame it on to the Censor )
wasn’t a builder, but as a demolisher there
were few like him.
A GOOD TIME COMING.
“I say, Gwen, sometimes I think the bally
war's goin’ to last another fifty years."
“Never mind, you'll be over the recruiting
age long before that."
Emilie Georges Albert Metin. leader of
the French Mission to Australia, who died
lately in the U.S. while en route, entered
the Chamber of Deputies in 1909, and was
Labor Minister in the Doumergue Ministry
(1913) and the Briand Ministry (1915). He
became Under-Secretary of State for the
Blockade last year. In 1900 he visited
Australia and Maoriland to report upon local
Labor and Social legislation for the French
Government. Later, he amplified his con-
clusions on the subject in his book “Social-
ism without Theories.”
t Harry Glance, now secretary of the
National Labor party in Victoria, was for
years general secretary of the Miners’ Union
in W. Aus., with headquarters at Boulder
City. While in the West he was an Arbi-
tration Court advocate, a J.P., a director of
the Worker newspaper, a race club official,
a Fire Board member, thrice Mayor of Boul-
der City, a delegate to innumerable Labor
conferences, and a member of the Labor
Federation. And for all that he got only
one screw, and that not an exorbitant one.
“R.A.Y.”: Late Police Superintendent
Alex. Johnson had the most strenuous holi-
day of a busy life when, as inspector at
Grafton (N.S.W.), he went to spend a
month’s vacation at the seaside village of
Yamba. On his arrival the disappearance
of a local Chinaman, with evidence of rob-
bery and bloodshed, was reported to him.
Next morning he telegraphed to the sergeant
of the nearest town to come and take up the
case, and received a reply that the sergeant
had just been shot in the thigh by a man
who had first shot his wife and was running
amok with a revolver. Then Johnson threw
down his fishing-lines and took up both cases,
involving four capital charges. A Cingalee
who had disappeared with the missing Chow
was traced to Maoriland, brought back, and,
as the body of the Chow could not be found,
he got seven years on the robbery charge.
He afterwards confessed that he had killed
the Chinaman and put the body into the har-
bor. The revolver artist got 15 years and
l lien Johnson resumed his holiday.
There seemed a tragic inappropriateness
about the passing out of Bigjohn For-
rest at sea the other day. The old man
should have died and been buried in the
Australia lie knew so well, for he was
a native son and one whom Aus-
tralians very justly held in the high-
est estimation as a man. His failings
were, all of the human sort. His personal
relations with his fellow men were always
those of a man with a big, kindly hear!.
The passage of time had obscured the
achievements of his earlier life as surveyor
and explorer. In the House of Reps,
his large, effulgent smile, beaming on all
mankind with the benevolent toleration of a
well-fed Providence, will be missed greatly
A queer personal vanity and
intense desire to give it
qualification took possession
of Bigjohn as he grew old.
The anxiety to get to London
was almost an obsession in the
later years, and this was one of
the reasons why he objected to
the double dissolution of 1914
engineered by Cook. John had
Ins eye firmly fixed on the
job of High Commis-
sioner—and would have
got it, too, if the election
at which Cook made a
mistake had gone the
right way. With the re-
turn of Fisher, he realised
that liis„ chances were
Hat, and he was a very sad giant there-
after. But tiie Fusion revived his hopes.
John gave that arrangement a strong push
from behind, and the “peerage” came if not as
a reward, at least as something politically
akin thereto—but it came too late. The old
man knew he was failing. Yet the idea of
getting to. London remained strong as ever.
The seat in the House of Lords called with
something of the insistence of the last trump.
He was 71 when they buried him at sea.
The world has a short memory, and good
Father Joffre, who commanded for France
in the first half of the great war, and lately
retired, worn out through carrying Europe
on his shoulders, is little heard of. The
dazzle of Foch has eclipsed him. Yet there
were points about Joffre. When he took
charge half. the French army hadn’t reached
the front—in fact some of it hadn’t started
from Tunis, Algiers, Morocco, Senegal or
Madagascar. The United States and Italy
hadn’t joined the Alliance. Russia was
miserably unready. Britain had supplied
only about 100,000 men. .Joffre had no
supreme control as Foch has. The last
straw was that he knew little of his officers
except by theory. Britain had tested its
commanders by big wars in the Soudan and
South Africa, and small ones in Egypt and
India. France hadn’t had a big experience
for 43 years, and the men it really knew
were very old. Joffre himself had made his
name chiefly by dragging an expedition
across the Sahara to Timbuctoo, which was
wonderful pioneering but not much else.
The war might never have shifted out 'of
Belgium if one of trie most admired book-
generals hadn t made every imaginable
blunder inside a few hours, losing Namur
and the lines of the Sambre and .Meuse-, add
breaking connection with the British at
Mons. Yet within a handful of weeks Joffre
made _ a wreck of the Hun’s invasion of
Lorraine, and his scheme for taking Verdun
in the rear; turned the enemy back from
the Marne; recovered the corner of Belgium
which the Allies still hold, and held out a
helpful paw which enabled the Belgian
garrison to make its eleventh-hour escape
from Antwerp. He is a big soldier, Father
Joffre.
Dead at his vineyard near Adelaide, at sb,
Richard Vernon Cholmondeley (pronounced
“Chumley”), a big handsome Englishman
of the best type. A particularly quiet citizen,
he came into the limelight only once, and
then it was thrown on him by his sister,
the successful English novelist. Mary
Cholmondeley. In her most-read book, "Red
Pottage,” there is a humorous scene of a
village temperance meeting, where an Aus-
tralian visitor is persuaded to give an address,
and it somehow turns into a plea for a glass
of good liquor taken in moderation. Her
brother, under the thin disguise of “Dick
Vernon,” was the hero of that incident.
Cecil Hunter Rodwell, Governor of Fiji,
on his way to assume office, is 44 years of
age, a son of W. 11. Rodwell, of Woodlands,
Suffolk. His mother was a daughter of the
late Sir S. Ruggles-Brise, K.C.8., of Spains
Hall, Essex ; his wife is a daughter of Her-
bert Ralland. There are two sons and one
daughter. The new Ex. served with the
Suffolk Yeomanry in South Africa, and was
attached to Lord Milner’s staff. His recent
occupation was Imperial Secretary to the
High Commissioner of South Africa, to
which job he was appointed in 1904.
“The Deacon”: One of the mistakes of a
big man was made by the late Cardinal
Moran when he was induced on a technical
breach to “silence” Father Piquet, S.M., of
Sc. Patrick’s, Sydney, the old church where
the street-lamp reflection lately blazed out
of the roof ventilator and attracted hundreds.
BIGJOHN FORREST.
(As seen by Low, in the Reps.)
The painful error was soon remedied, but the
volatile little French priest was deeply grieved.
The facts were, this good-natured cleric
attended on an urgent request a sick call
outside St. Pat’s parish, to oblige somebody
who afterwards gave him away. Father
Piquet is known as the “Grand Peni-
tentiary” to his clerical penitents, who
number most of the secular clergy of Sydney
and suburbs, whilst his lay penitents must
number thousands. It takes a remarkable
man to win the complete confidence of so
many.
Richard Nicholas Johnson, who died at
Randwick, Sydney, last week, was recently
Commissioner of Stamps. He was son of
John Johnson, who made a pile as a cooper,
and his fh’st employment was as junior clerk
in the Stamp office when William Hemming
was_ Commissioner. When the office was
abolished Johnson was moved into the
Sheriffs Department, and when the Stamp
Office was reconstituted, he came in as Com-
missioner. He was 71 when the light failed.
‘John Quill”: The late Archdeacon
McGrath, of Rockley (N.S.W.), whose death
was chronicled in The Bulletin a few
weeks ago, was a typical Irish priest—fat,
jovial, rough and ready, with a fine tolera-
tion for the followers of any opposing creed.
During a previous illness a relieving priest
from Bathurst spoke to the old archdeacon
concerning his burial-place in the event of
his death. “Where the tree falls,” quoted
his Riverence, “there let it lie?” So when
his time came they pulled up the boards in
the church at Rockley, and buried him there
on his 75th birthday.

TWO WOMEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If I should lie a maimed and broken ihint;
Amid the carnage, without sense or light,
While from me sturdy, iron-hearted men
Would turn away to shudder at the sight—
If, when the cry for men was loudest called,
And round me never was a craven heart,
And in my hands the long-fought issue hung,
If then I turned and played the coward’s part—
Still, to the end and through Eternity,
There are two women who would stay with me.
If in the battle some relentless fate
Shattered my fragments to the wind and dust —
If in my weakness all restraint had fled
And left me grovelling at the feet of Lust —
II to the sea’s cold depth, the land’s moist clay,
My body yields its flesh all scarred and worn,
While to an endless penitence in Hell,
My spirit sinks of hope and courage shorn —-
Still, though the universe may melt away,
There arc two women who would wait and pray.
Two things there are most sacred that I keep;
My mother's smile, my sweetheart's happy
laughter.
Though every effort fail and I grow tired,
Yet can t dream of that sweet peace hereafter,
When I shall see the glorious smile once more
Shall hear that laugh and kiss that rosy mouth
If I return; and, though the husjv remains,
My fettered soul will wander to the South;
Eor till the noise of guns shall cease to be,
There are two women there awaiting me.
GEORGE R. HAMBIOGE.

T HE MAN: “He is a fascinating man and lie

THE WOMAN : “I wonder if he’s dying to
bestow it on a nice girl?”
From a leading Californian journalist:—
You will be interested perhaps in having me
confirm your information to the effect that
the United States is in this war practically to
the extent of 100 per cent. We are voluntarily (and
by “voluntarily” I mean without being forced by legal
enactment) doing without such foods as we are
advised are essential to the maintenance of the
Allied armies; doing without lights, when re-
quested ; without heat, when requested; are limiting
out travel to necessary journeys, cutting out the joy-
riding, when joy-riding means vacations and loss of
time; doing without luxuries to a most appreciable
extent, considering the extravagant squandering habits
the American people have been addicted to; and
adjusting all of our business to a war basis; our
banks, our farms, our stock-ranges, our manufac-
tories, our lands, our everything are headed toward a
war-victory. Capital is loyal, labor is loyal, the
press is loyal; our million in France is supported
by several millions of soldiers in prospect, all of
them of the same spirit and mettle and desire and
purpose that have been exhibited recently on the
Western Front. Let no one cast even the slightest
doubt upon what America intends to do, and will do
in this war; and, remember, that we have no such
illusion as that we are fighting the Kaiser and not
the German people. Virtually, all of our people are
convinced that the Kaiser is a true representative of
the German nation.

The Bishop of Adelaide has put before his
Anglican flock a scheme for the decent pay-
ment of some of its clergymen, who at
present do not get a fair living wage. The
idea is that every man actually in charge of
a parish or district shall receive a minimum
of £225, also a house; stipend to increase £3
each year of service; and an allowance of
£lO a year for every girl under 18 or boy

“Goldsborough”: Just before the first
referendum was taken, when people who
clidp’t know him thought Hughes would
bring national service in by Act of Parlia-
ment, some 20-odd stalwart young Irishmen
left the Transcontinental railway line, and
coming into Kalgoorlie lit out for San Fran-
cisco, declaring that they wouldn’t fight for
Britain. California found work for them
for awhile; but when America went to war,
rifles were found for the 20, and they are
now hard at it in France. Had they stayed
here they would have missed an elegant fight.

The cry in England is still for man
(and woman) power; but it isn’t so
loud that small newspaper shouts like this
remain unheard :—•
Head Kitehenmaid wanted; 3 in kitchen; family
two; 10 servants; excellent situation.
Maid-Housekeeper, 1 lady, 10 servants, required,
£4O.
Cook (good) required; comfortable situation, one
mile from country town, seven servants, one kitchen-
maid ; two in family; wages £4O to £45.
That is about 30 servants (house only) to
look after the domestic wants of, apparently,
five persons; but if they did not exist, no
doubt, three highly-ornamental ladies might
be prevented by the necessity for washing
potatoes (they are no longer peeled in
Britain) from driving to town and being
photographed as people interested in war
work.

“Bad Australian’s” adventure :
The evening was rather warm off the coast of
Somewhere, and we were doing a “banji” on the
upper deck about 5 p.m., when sud-
denly a curious rippling appeared on
the surface of an otherwise unruffled
sea, right abeam and about 200
metres off. The observer with the
captive balloon attached to one of
the destroyers forming the convoy was
as quick on to that rippling as we
were, and the way that destroyer
whipped around almost within her
own length and bore down on the
nearest end of the commotion at
about 40 miles an hour was a genuine
eye-opener. She dropped five depth
charges in rapid succession, and the
manner in which our old crate heaved
and shuddered with each concussion
gave us the straight tip as to what
was happening to Otto down under. I
don’t know whether the Censor will
permit me to say so, but Bill’s under-
sea fleet is another unit short. From
what I saw and heard that drowsy
afternoon I feel sure that any living
thing coming within 150yds. of the
actual point of explosion of a depth
charge has about as big a chance of
surviving as I have of inheriting the
Morgan millions. It is not all sauer-
kraut and laager off the coast of Somewhere these
days.
The Holy Land strikes one tired Billjim
as devilish. This comes up like a cry from
the abyss:—•
We have dropped some 3800 ft. into the Jordan
Valley—“ The Valley of Death,” 1100 ft. below sea-
level —the air heavy as lead and the heat awful. We
lie naked on blankets at night, while a million weird
things walk over us; dust a foot deep everywhere, and
a crowd of men down with malaria (Jordan) and
dysentery. Mosquito-nets keep away the buzzers, but
they don’t protect you against snakes, which are very
deadly—one little devil especially, called the “horned
viper.” Even the mild exertion of writing this makes
me sweat, and Abdul’s whizbangs are coming over
good and plenty. From here we can see the Mount
of Temptation, where the Devil tried-—but you know
all about that. Just below is the “Place of Medita-
tion,” but I can’t recommend it. For those who have
the meditation habit Randwick or Flemington can
give it points.

“Gleniris” : Melbourne is now being saved
from the burning by an itinerant mission,
despatched hither from Michigan (U.S.A.),
by its spiritual leaders, Benjamin and Mary,
of the Israelite House of David. The local
Benjies allege that they are the true elect,
anticipating material immortality, and that
in all time there will only be the precise
number of 144,000 citizens to escape the
grave. They admit that resurrection of the
soul (only) is to happen to a great company
of lesser people; but for themselves and their
own adherents they claim perpetual im-
munity from death. How to get into the
undying ranks is told by various literary
Benjamaries in a line of publications rang-
ing in price from 25 cents to $2, the list
including a vegetarian cook-book. The male
of this American brand of Israelite wears
his hair in Ion" ringlets, and all the whiskers
he can crowd on his face; and on special
occasions (such as sitting for his photo-
graph) he sports a clutch of gewgaws on
his chest. He’ll discover presently that
Australia mostly prefers, to wear its hair
short and dustless and take the usual
chances with the undertaker, even if the cost
of dying is becoming rather disheartening.
South Aus. Criminal Court is taking time
to consider the fate of a man who pleaded
guilty to altering the name on a death-
certificate. He had reasons for the decep-
tion. It was found that the Act which makes
the action a felony forgot to name any
penalty. So Bench and Bar united in dig-
ging up statutes of from 70 to 100 years ago
which professed to deal with offences not
elsewhere enumerated, but as the thoughts
of legislators of those days turned to either
hanging or flogging or transportation when
they had an option, the old authorities are
not much help in the present mild trouble.

“L.L.W.” : Tucked away on a back page
of Sydney D.T. (3/9/’18) are some mild
howls from teachers anent Holman’s amaz-
ing statement that £27,000 had been spent
last year on increases in their salaries and
that £39,000 had been placed on this year’s
Estimates for a similar purpose. The truth
is that the £27,000 was not used for in-
creases, but tor paying the higher salaries
due to promoted teachers and “war-time”
teachers engaged during the year. Unlike
other public servants teachers receive - no
annual increments. Classified teachers have
not received one penny increase since 1911.
Melbourne fears lest it may have to sus-
pend part of its tramway service very soon,
unless it can harness the obsolescent horse
to its little juggernauts. The old cables are
wearing out, and the new cables aren’t

ARMORED CARS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is duty for the horsemen when they’ve gathered
up the reins;
There’s a throbbing in the foothills and a purring on
the plains ;
There is dust as well as darkness, and a veil across
the stars
When the flying squadrons gallop with the racing
armored cars.
There is panic and distraction
When the troops swing into action,
And the light machine-guns rattle from the cars.
To the east of old Ivhalasa there was danger-laden
work
When the regiments manoeuvred to engage the stub-
born Turk;
There were jolts among the boulders, there were
scores of nasty jars
For the gunners and the drivers of the speeding
armored cars;
But the Turkish horsemen scattered
When the bullets chipped and spattered
On the rocks from where they fired upon the cars.
Where the roads are winding skyward on the moun-
tains bare and steep ;
Where the jaded horses clamber and the loaded
limbers creep;
Like a host of sleek destroyers, stripped of running
gear and spars,
You can hear the throb of engines and perceive the
armored cars.
There’s a purring and a quaking,
For the heavy shells are breaking
Where the mounted men are pacing with the cars.

This skeleton view shows
the method of morticing and
tenoning each joint in the
back of the Beale Piano —a
most essential construction
to insure tone-permanency
Enlarged section of the
bass end of sound-
board. As the strings
in the bass vibrate at a
much slower rate than
the treble, the wood at
this end of the sound-
board is coarser.
How Perfect Tone-quality is Assured
'THE sound-board has rightly been called the “soul of a piano. It must be
1 constructed of most carefully selected timber and be scientifically graded so
as to sympathetically respond to the vibrations of the strings. This is work
for experts— -craftsmen who are thoroughly conversant with acoustic principles
and know how to apply them.
In the making of the Beale Piano the sound-board is
constructed in exactly the same way as the belly of a
violin. The best quality white pine is used clear,
straight-grained wood that has the most resonant
properties of all woods for this purpose. Ihe
sound-board is not one big piece of wood but is
built up of small strips of about six inches width.
These are graded from very coarse grain in the bass
to very fine m the treble. The ribs are manufactured
from clear-grained fir and each one is not only glued
to the back of the board, but screwed as well. 1 hese
ribs are of a particular shape which gives a convex
surface to the front of the board. Then when the
bridges are affixed and the strings placed into
position the sound-board deflects the tone waves m
exactly the same way as does the belly of a violin.
This convex surface —or camber—must be perma-
nent, otherwise tone-quality will be impaired, Every
Beale sound-board is guaranteed in writing, for Zd
years. Even in the far north of Queensland the
Beale Piano retains its fine gradations of on f7T a

register, and a deep sonorous, powerful bass.

“Passenger’s” complaint:—
On the Victorian and N. S. Wales sections of the
railway journey from Melbourne to Sydney there
isn’t much to choose for discomfort and crudity of
arrangements. Neither of the States’ department
provides adequate attendance or the convenience of
a medicine-chest, consequently a passenger who has
the bad luck to be taken ill on the journey can
only hope to be turned out to die comfortably on
the airy platform of the first stopping ‘ place. The
guard of the train doesn’t carry even a simple cure
for stomach-ache, or an air-cushion. I doubt
whether the trains are supplied with guards and
chuekers-out, for the other night, at 2 a.m., a
couple of ladies sought safety in the compartment
where I was seeking rest, and their complaint was
that a gang of drunken individuals, roaming the
length of the train and raising Cain’s delight, had
intruded themselves upon these two unprotected
females in a carriage “reserved for ladies.” They were
hard-doers from the second-class ear, tormenting
the occupants of a first-class women’s compartment,
.vet there was no vigilant authority to restrict them
to their own car, not to mention the necessity for
hitting them on the head with a mallet. This was
after leaving Albury for Sydney, and the charge
is against the N. S. Wales railways. Now*, for
the return journey, I travelled by the later portion
of the express, paying just as much for my journey
as the people who pay extra for a bed on the earlier
division of the train. And lam told by a guard
that he doesn’t think he can find me a seat! The
ticket had cost £ 3-odd, but it didn’t carry the cer-
tainty of a seat with it, seemingly. The porter
who carried my luggage informed me that somebody
was hoping I would bribe him to favor me with a
seat in the blessed train where I was going to breathe
OWNER’S RISK.
THE WARRIOR: “I admit I hissed her. But

cheapens it so.”
a bad atmosphere for 12 hours, and where the wash-
ing accommodation was planned on a 25 per cent,
scale— i.e., there was one lavatory and one clean
towel where there ought to have been four. How-
ever, I eventually secured a seat without paying for
the privilege. Arrived at Albury at breakfast time —
what did I find? We had a bare 20 minutes in
which to shift our belongings from one train to
another, and then, having secured a seat for the
balance of the deadly journey, travel a long
platform in order to obtain the only apology
for a breakfast that would offer for the next four
hours. Until recently the second division of the
Sydney-to-Melbourne express had a dining-car
attached after leaving Albury, like the first division,
which is kept waiting the arrival of its unfortunate
mate. But the dining, or, rather, the breakfast,
car has been removed. Certainly the scandal
needs inquiry. Guards and porters loudly notify
the victimised public that time is on the wing—
“only 16 more minutes,” I heard one calling out, and
the only opportunity to get breakfast lies at the dis-
tant end of the long, long platform. The position is this.
Passengers by the train which travels with a feeding-
car are kept an Unconscionably long time at Albury
to take breakfast there at their leisure, whether
they like the detention or not, whereas passengers
by the following train, who have no choice of break-
fast time, are compelled to buy food hastily and be
thankful they can get it. This charge is against the
Victorian railways. On both sides of the Murray
the long-journey arrangements are equally behind
the times.

Bill and Jim were scrapping, on general
principles, when Abdul flew over and took a
hand. Jim got the worst of what was scat-

all right, digger,” he said in gasps. “I’ll be
waitin’ for y’ when y’ arrive !”
There is great need for a
statute under which a person who
tries to influence public opinion,
not by argument, for that is intan-

the argument is based, could be
called upon to produce his facts.

ject to a heavy minimum fine,

adulteration of the truth; (2)

mon swindler who gets money or

As a case in point a Vic. Salvation
Army “brigadier” lately staggered
an audience with a story about two
State-school children who had been
punished for not taking part in a
gamble. An utterly staggered
department asked for details so
that it might suppress iniquities of
the sort, but the cleric, as is usual
with clerics, side-stepped lightly,
saying that, by the wish of the
parties concerned, he would not go
into details and that he would
drop the subject. Possibly, being
a brigadier, he was incapable of
understanding that gentlemen don’t
scatter slanders about and then get
out crab fashion when the slan-
dered party asks for details. And
there is no law to knock a vague
sensationalist’s head against the
wall till he fills in the gaps of his
narrative or else admits himself
a plain liar.
“Silas’s” yarn of the casual Australian: —
This time he was picked up by “Rover” Carton
when Rover and his gang were bringing the pick
of Bellford’s herds south in anticipation of an eager
Victorian market. Carton had just lost the only
man of the gang who could cook anything more
exacting than an egg, and seized upon Stone with
some avidity, although Stone confessed to being only
grade three in the amateur class considered as a
cook. As long as Stone confined his culinary efforts
to fried chops or fried steak and plain boiled pota-
toes done in the hide, he worked no particular mis-
chief, but after a few days the man grew ambitious,
and spread himself over a Sunday dinner of three
courses. It was not a conspicuous success, but
every man present admitted having eaten worse, and
Stone, who was the least demonstrative of his kind,
accepted this admission as a compliment without
adopting any garlands. But along in the afternoon
the new cook manifested an unusual interest in the
men’s physical well-being. Carton, Wimble, McClure
and Hobhouse were playing cards behind the tilted
dray, and every ten minutes or so Stone lounged up,
and leaning on a wheel, presently remarked: “I
s’pose youse blokes is feelin’ all right?” Oh, yes,
they were quite well, thanks. “Dinner ain’t dis-
agreein’ with you at all' noticeable ?” Not at all.
But after the third visitation Hobliouse wanted to
know what the phosphorescent winter-resort was the
matter with that elongated hound of an inflamed

cook. “Oh, nothink; nothink the matter,” Stone
assured him. “On’y a man likes to know how his
work’s goin’ on.” Wimble was the first to fall ill.
Then McClure turned his toes up. “Better get ’em
along to the doctor et Elmhill,” said Stone calmly,
and began to harness up. “You better all get along
to the doctor. I expect I did use it, after all.”
“Used what?” roared Carton. “That there strychnine
powder you had fer the cattle’s sore feet. I might
have mistook it fer salt, ’n’ put it in the spuds. I
had me doubts all along.” There was a simulta-
neous rush for the doctor .at Elmhill, and after much
pumping and other distressing remedial treatment
the gang was pronounced out of danger. “You
blazin’, blitherin’ idiot, why didn’t you tell us about
it before?” screamed Carton at the cook, after
kicking him off an 80-acre lot. Stone did not take
the kicking unkindly. He leaned on a rail, and
scratched his ear. “I wanted to be certain,” he said.

“Fax” has a complaint:—
Having been brought up in my youth to pass the
mustard after helping myself, I now cherish a
grievance against the stupidity of the Vic. Pure
Foods Act which has practically put the old mustard-
pot out of business by requiring the condiment to be
served dry. I no longer want any mustard with my
own beef, or have any friends who expect it to be
passed along. Dry mustard is like dry humor (so
branded). It hasn’t the virtue of mustard mixed
with water. It appealeth not to the palate. Why
was the public commanded to eat mustard dry? A
metal spoon left in liquid mustard is apt to acquire
verdigris, and because somebody was proved to have
died from the effects of a neglected spoon in a yellow
mixture of long standing, the editors of the Pure
Foods \rt cut mustard-and-water out. As a safeguard
against verdigris consumption this arbitrary decree
ranks with the fabled prohibition of roast pork
owing to the arochryphal incendiarism of the Chows
who burned thor houses in order to cook the pig.
An order torWdtiirg mustard-pots to have metal tops
or spoons would have met all health requirements,
without affecting the ancient and popular character
of the pot’s contents. But the Law, even when its
intentions are purely hygienic, prefers to stand to
its cld traditions. I never knew the Law to be such
a barracker for its old traditions as it is nowadays.
"F. Seedy”: Going up the Tigris River in
.Mesopotamia the army commandeered a
couple of lurkish steamers, and volunteers
were called for to run them. A Rilliim
stepped out and said to the English 0.0. of
Engineers: "I can run the injin.” The Eng-
lishman looked at. him hard and said : “Now,
my man, suppose your
condenser suddenly stopped
working, what would you
do'.'” “I’d have n squint
at the valves.” “Yes; and
suppose they were 'found
in order and the condenser
still not working?” “I’d
have a peep at the piston.”
"Yes, and then?” "I’d
have a look at the pipes
going to the. skin of the
ship.” "Yes, and suppos-
ing these were,all in order
and condenser still not
working?” “Well, blime.
I'd take a walk up on deck

■‘Hamer'’: For happy childishness and
innocent belief in pleasing rumor, commend
me to the French soldier. We were on a
stationary picquet to prevent Australians
from trespassing in the vicinity of French
headquarters when the rumor came through
* one of the estaminets that the Allied forces
in the South had cut off a German salient
and captured 25,000 prisoners. Our neigh-
bors, who had churnmed-up and learnt that
the right form of address to nnv of us was
“Dig-gare,” brought wine to o.ur camp, with
the news that the prisoner-haul was, really,
180,000, while the whole of the Crown
Prince’s army was gradually surrendering.
It was a great night. They taught us games.
A highly-elevated Aussie, with a piece of
paper fastened to the tail of his coat, wriggled
himself, hopping, about the fields, while an
assorted crowd of Frenchmen and Aus-
tralians, shouting and laughing, and also
hopping, tried to set fire to the paper with
lighted candles and matches. It would have
been a great sight for Fritz if he had sent a
few ’planes over; and the French anti-
aircraft guard, whose duty it was to see that
no lights were shown, would probably have
interfered if it hadn’t been so engrossed in
the game.

in his day, and it was acknowledged that
he was always mounted on one of the very

What the Mines teach you about these Belts
Of the hundreds of thousands of
pounds sterling expended each year
for belting, the mining industry pays
most.
Belts, to it, are ever a more formid-
able factor in production costs than
they are in mills and factories.
Being such a formidable proportion
of expense they are checked up more
rigidly than in other industries.
What the mines do to reduce these
costs can well be done by others.
In some mining companies scrutiny
of belt expense extends to maintain-
ing officials expressly charged with
the duty of reducing it.
It is significant that such companies
are among the first purchasers of
Goodyear Belts.
Their accurate cost accounting shows that
Goodyear belts are the most instrumental in
reducing the year’s belting bill.
It is also significant that many mining industry
belt experts buy on the Goodyear plan of plant
analysis.
They have Goodyear men make a survey of
every drive, conveyor and elevator to specify
the proper Goodyear belt for each.
The entire set of specifications constitutes a
complete analysis of the plant’s belting needs.
Goodyear men have already made hundreds of
such investigations and reports.
They cover many important plants, factories
and mills in every Australian industry.
Everywhere they are the means of effecting
considerable savings.
They can do it for you also.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Compulsory voting is again in the Vic-
torian political atmosphere, the roll-up at
the State polls having been thin of late years.
The trouble is to create a compulsory
admiration for at least one of the two candi-
dates—there are very often only two. One
way out of the difficulty, and probably the
best way, is to have bigger constituencies
with three, four or five members, and to use
the preferential vote. With five members to
a constituency Victoria would have 13 elec-
torates and 13 separate rows instead of 65
electorates and 65 shindies. There would
be less expense and more fun, and the pre-
ferential vote not only brings out more
candidates, except when things are very
dead, but breaks up the dreary old party
machines. It gives the dark horse or inde-

pendent politician a chance to come up the
straight unexpectedly and win in a canter.
Another possibility is to allow a negative
vote, so that if the compulsory voter hates
both candidates, he can say so, and if enough
of him says so both candidates will be dis-
qualified for the term of that Parliament,
and there will be a fresh nomination. With-
out the negative vote it would of course be
necessary to abolish the unopposed candi-
date. Whether electorates returned one
member or five it would be necessary to
make sure that there was at least an extra
man—in five-member districts there should
be five extras —else there would be the
absurdity of the whole community going to
the poll at some expense to approve unani-
mously of Hobson’s choice. A sufficient
number of mayors and town clerks
be made compulsory candidates. Another
absurd possibility is that the compulsory
mayor might be adopted by one party as its
candidate, and the other party might not
nominate. Then to prevent both the candi-
date and the whole body of voters being
compulsory some more mayors would have
to be put up to make a race.
Jack Scaddan, ex-Premier of W.A., who
is now running a flourmill, was a member of
the Enginedrivers’ Association when he first
stood for Parliament, and about the most
unlikely political fledgling till then dis-
covered. Quite a regiment of triers thronged
the preliminary selection ballot, and John,
although he did not speak, was one of three
reserved for the final selection ballot. His
two opponents were loquacious Morgan
Field and Nick Reside. The latter was
brother to the late Jack Reside, M.L.A., and
this relationship, and the fact that he had
dramatised “The Mercy of Tiberius,” were
his recommendations. Scaddan put in
an appearance to make a 20-minute speech,
and a fuddled interjector enabled him to fill
in th-e time. At the conclusion of his re-
marks he was asked three questions, the
last of which was, “Have you read ‘Progress
and Poverty’?” “No,” was the reply ; “but I
hope that won’t tell against me. If elected
I’ll read it.” He won.
Considering how often the N. S. Wales
State Government has pleaded the same old
war as the reason of its big expenditure, it
is interesting to learn that last year it spent
out of revenue £355,588 by reason of the
same old struggle, mostly in making good to
enlisted officials the difference between their
civil and military pay. Seeing that the
total expenditure is £3,500,000 a year more
than before the war started, and is to go up
about another million this year, the “war
expenditure” hardly seems worth mention-
ing. Rut The Bulletin, for one, hardly
cares how much Holman spends so long as
he doesn’t spend loan money. (As a side
issue there was another £270,000 of “war
expenditure,” but that was charged to
loans.) If a Minister razzles too much with
the money of the living he is lihble to hear
about it. But when he razzles with the
money of the unborn it is a miserable way
of buying office and popularity.
“Trot” passes in some more arithmetic: —
The new Revenue Bill introduced last week into
the United States Congress includes provision for
heavier taxes on incomes, the general effect of the
whole measure being to double the revenue. Under
this measure taxable incomes of £5OO a year pay
tax of £6; of £lOOO, tax £36; of £2OOO, tax
£169; of £lO,OOO, tax £2499. Notice how swift
the graduation is? Now try a sample of the Com-
monwealth income tax in Australia —Income £5OO,
tax £lO 3s. Id., plus 25 per cent. £2 10s. 9d. ;
total £l2 13s. lOd. £lOOO, tax £2B 2s. 6d., plus
£7 ss. 6d. ; total £35 Bs. £2OOO, tax £B7 10s.,
plus £2l 17s. 6d.; total £lO9 7s. 6d. £lO,OOO,
tax £1597 10s., plus £319 10s.; total £1917.
So there you are. In Australia the smallest of
these incomes pays over 100 per cent, more than
in America. Then it goes the other way with
increasing benevolence as the fat increases. The
£lOOO a year taxable income in Australia hands
over £7 17s. 6d. less than the same income in
America, the £2OOO income £59 12s. 6d. less; the
£lO,OOO income £5Bl 10s. less. Another circum-
stance is that in America the man with £2OOO
to pay on hands out 4J times more liberally to
win the war than the man with £lOOO. In Aus-
tralia he passes over less than three times as much.
Of course the State taxation has to be reckoned on
to get a full measure of the levy in the two coun-
tries ; but it is relatively small and does not affect
the deplorable comparison. . The Yank takes to the
big man with both hands first. In Australia the
little chap is reached for first.
lii 1910 it dawned on Britain that Aus-
tralia was failing as a wheat supplier, and
that the U-boats were sinking food ships
rather fast. So it took large, sudden and
strenuous measures to rebuild its almost lost
agricultural industry. In one year it added
787,000 acres to the area under wheat and
did almost as much in oats. In the British
Isles 33 or 84 bushels of wheat per acre was
about the regular crop even under the old
slovenly methods, so the revival represented
about 25,000,000 extra bushels. That one
year’s waking up made the country inde-
pendent of the usual Australian supply, and
J. Bull says he has only begun to wake. If
he rouses much more it will be up to this
country to arrange a preference treaty.
“S.M.” writes: —
I read that Senator Gardiner, supposing he is very
temporarily disfranchised and disqualified under the
proposed N. S. Wales sedition law, will set to work
to create a “physical force party”—in other words, I
presume, to organise revolution. He must put a high
value on his political services if he thinks it worth
while starting a civil war—which may get out of
hand and lead to rape, murder, theft, abduction,
incendiarism and financial disaster —to prevent the
country being deprived of them. Or else he must
have an idea of his own dignity exceeding
the pride of archdukes, importers, sultans and
Hohenzollerns. Plenty of people are under dis-
abilities of one sort and another. Prisoners are not
allowed to sit in Parliament or any other public body
or to vote for anything, and some of them are shut
out (that is to say shut in) for life. Even confinees
under suspicion can’t vote. The N. S. Wales Govern-
ment, however, proposes, as a matter of courtesy, to
disqualify certain people outside gaol instead of
putting them inside. Other people who are out in
the cold include lunatics, aliens, people who lack a
certain residential qualification, persons recently out
of gaol after doing three months, persons convicted
within a year before the election of quite a number
of offences large and small, and sundries. The Federal
law even disqualifies undischarged bankrupts. Every
blessed soul in N. S. Wales is disqualified as an
elector for the Upper House because the promise to
reform that body wasn’t kept. Some countries carry
the thing much further —for instance, in France
princes are disqualified. The United States
disqualified Jefferson Davis for life because he

had been head of a revolution. Deprivation of
civil rights is the most common form of punishment
in many democratic countries; in quite a number
it even applies to individuals who can’t read large
print. Amputation of the vote is really no more
painful than getting the hair cut. No doubt it may
seem absurd to shut out of State politics anybody
who denounces defence against the Ilun, which is a
Federal affair. But then the question has been
dragged in everywhere, and has even intruded into
drainage boards. But what I really want to say is
that if Senator Gardiner has his discourse interrupted
under the .N. S. Wales Sedition law it will be by
the will of the majority so far as that has been
ascertained by the system devised by the majority.
It may be right or wrong, but if the minority (or
one member of it) is to let loose the forces of
rebellion and possible carnage whenever it (or he)
feels it (or his) dignity hurt, it (or he) being the
sole judge in the case, then there will be very little
unsmashed furniture or unburnt houses in the State
—and houses are scarce just now. It doesn’t
matter much if Mr. Gardiner curses over his wrongs
and I hope he will curse with force and originality.
It doesn’t matter if he personally does wholesale
assault or wrecks a house or two. But when he
hints that he may, over a petty personal affront,
let loose unknown forces of devastation which may
do untold harm to the innocent and helpless and
give fanatics a chance to burn cathedrals and violate
graves, he is either a case of profound wickedness or
an amateur boy brigand talking through his hat.
“Green Light”: Victoria is to have a new
railways union of the “non-political” type of
workers’ association, so favored by Fat when
there is already a Trades Hall union in the
field. The new T concern will try to justify
its existence by “presenting to the authori-
ties the views of the men on matters affect-
ing their own interest as employees”; and
this will mean, of course, a lot of cap-in-
handing to secure what under other con-
ditions the toiler should be able to get without
any sacrifice of dignity. For years the shining
lights of the Y.R.U. have at intervals been
holding the threat of a strike over the rail-
ways management, and generally getting
themselves heartily disliked by the whole
community as a selfish, uncivil, slacking,
tip-taking body of men. They certainly
don’t deserve this reputation, as a whole';
yet, if the more sober-sided V.R.U. members
had in the past taken a really serious view
of their duty to themselves and doing their
share in quenching the firebrands, the com-
munity’ would have had less reason for its
present nasty feelings and there would be
less occasion for any embarrassing split in
the railway men’s ranks. The union is
notoriously divided against itself, particu-
larly on matters of strike policy and the
proper method of “putting it up to the
boss,” and it spends much of its time in
futile squabbles that lead the worker no-
where.
The “bringing together of the industrial
and political wings of the Labor party.”
which is the avowed aim of the most con-
spicuous organisers, is a mixing of things
that tends to a heap of trouble. An improve-
ment in wages or conditions, and the re-
establishment at our very door of the Ilun
murderer with all his ambitions and his
war-like apparatus are to appear on the
same programme as
part of the same pol-
icy. And when a diffi-
culty of any kind
arises no one will know
under these muddled
circumstances whether
the employee has a
grievance of his own
or whether he is trying
to s y s t e matically
harass and injure the
employing class for
being mostly anti-
Hun. To deal with an
Australian worker is
one thing; to deal with
a man who is pledged
by his no-annexations
policy to the leaving
of Alsace - Lorraine
under the grinding
tyranny of the alien
Hun militarists is an-
other. Alsace, by the
way, has a history of
its own. It became
largely French when
the free and semi-
republican State of
Strasburg, realising
that it wasn’t strong
enough to stand alone,
an d preferring a
French king who was
pretty bad to a Ger-
man tyrant who was
much worse, threw in
its lot with France.
It became wholly
French when the re-
public of Mulhouse
decided to become part
of republican France.
That was “self-determination” of a sort.
The Hun holds Alsace by sheer violence, and
the Australian Labor programme proposes
that he should still keep it.
“G.A.”: John Yerran, late Premier of
S.A., who on account of his advocacy of
conscription was turned down by the Labor
unions, and as a “Nationalist” was defeated
at the last elections, has found employment in
connection with the Wheat Scheme—fore-
man at Kadina —and Labor members of the
Assembly want to know why he received the
appointment. The hatred of the present
Laborites of everything connected with the
Nationalists is such a tremendous thing that
not satisfied with ending a man’s political
career they appear to want to keep him
unemployed for life. In reply the Govern-
ment said it was very pleased to be able to
do something for a man who had four or
five little grandchildren to support. If the
Department considered, after a trial, that
the ex-Labor leader was not capable, he
would not be retained. The policy of hound-
ing a man who saw his way clear, though it
was not popular with the party, in the
nation’s emergency seems to be about the
most prominent plank in the Labor platform
these days. What’s all this gas about free-
speech and liberty of conscience, anyhow?
MAGNA CHARTA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Brookfield: Would it not be as well for the
Government to pass a Bill to strike its political
opponents dumb?” —Press report.
Let it be passed. A Bill to strike them dumb
Would give this world of ours its great relief.
Brave is the music of a marching drum,
And sweet the whisper of a falling leaf;
But words that warring politicians say
Wear the stout heart and make the whiskers grey.
Let silence fall upon the jarring ranks.
Make still all opposition yells by law.
Then those in power may rest and render thanks,
Sitting with upturned eyes and moveless jaw ;
And in the splendid quiet, while they think,
Men shall have peace to hear the glasses clink.
Since great Demosthenes and Cicero
Poured classic floods of talk o’er ancient times,
Or Chatham's rolling speech was heard to flow,
Or Gladstone’s talk exposed the Tory’s crimes
The world has shaken to the tongue’s loud stuff,
But now takes heart of grace to cry “Enough.”
Let it be passed. A cure for every ill
Is in that measure once it stood as law.
Let it be named our Magna Charta Bill—■
The golden muzzle of the tireless jaw.
In the glad silence from the ages won
We might rejoice at last in something done.

WORMS— THE SYMPTOMS.
The symptoms of worms are manifold,
embracing not only facial indications and
depression of the whole system, but serious
irritation and much distress.
IX VERY YOUNG CHILDREN much of
the irritability and fretfulness is often due
to the presence of worms. Restlessness,
fitfulness, sudden starts, hardness and fulness
of the belly, irregular movement of the
bowels, and excessive excretion of saliva
from the mouth, are invariably indications
of the irritation caused by worms.
IN OLDER CHILDREN the same symp-
toms are present, but more distinctly defined.
Grinding of the teeth, violent movements of
the legs and arms, and an undue flow of
saliva, which causes frequent efforts to
swallow. When awake there is a constant
desire to pick the nose and scratch the irri-
tated parts. The bowels are irregular, and
frequently the movement of the-worms causes
diarrhoea, alternating with costiveness. The
breath is usually foul, and the child is
languid and peevish. The tongue preter-
naturally red, or alternately clean and
covered with a white, slimy mucus. A short,
dry cough, frequent slimy stools (excretion
from the bowels) ; emaciation, slow fever,
irregular pulse; and sometimes convulsions.
Loss of appetite frequently alternates with a
craving for food. Indeed, the latter symp-
tom is most pronounced in many cases, and
many mothers have experienced the insatiable
appetites of their children without realising
the cause.

THE BLUES.
No man or woman is more sick of life than
when they have that trouble commonly
called “The Blues.” It amounts to a disease in many cases. That terrible feeling
which makes all the world appear gloomy without one ray of brightness. Even one
best friends seem to have deserted them. Every little trouble adds fuel to the
down-hearted, despondent being. Some fly to drink for solace, but strong drink never
can cure fits of melancholy. In nine cases out of ten this state of mind arises from a
deranged system, in all probability from a disordered state of the Liver, which is
draining the energy from the system, making you languid and irritable, at cross
purposes with everyone you come in contact with. You require a medicine which
will put a move into your system, enliven your liver, stimulate your circulation and
soothe your nerves. Takeashort course of DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS,
which will impart health and vigor through the medium of a well-regulated system.

“D.” : At Saibai, the most northerly island
of Bnnanaland, there may be seen decorating the sea-
scape a circular fence of mangrove poles, about 20ft. in
diameter. I recently discovered the use of the barri-

cade. When there has been a good catch of turtle
some are turned loose into the paddock. Here they
can be kept for weeks, for, as -the tide regularly
floods the enclosure, there is no danger of them
dying from exposure to the tropical sun. Thus a
plentiful supply of fresh meat is provided for the
proprietary families while they are away at work
oil the reefs. It’s a big improvement on the salt
junk or tinned horse we whites have to consume. By
the way, it is the green turtle that is chiefly used for
food. The shell variety (he is the joker that pro-
vides the ladies with combs and other fal-lals),
though edible, requires an expert to do the slaughter-
ing. At Dauan Island, some years ago, about 20
people died as a result of the ignorance of the
butcher. During cutting-up operations, should a
certain vein in the neck be severed, the contents
rapidly impregnate the whole of the meat with
poison. Natives are very keen on turtle meat, and
are always ready for a feed, but they fight shy of
this particular gentleman unless they are quite sure
who struck the fatal blow.
“Leo Lear” : A few architectural styles of
our birds. The comparatively small (15in.) scrub-
fowl of North Queensland builds the biggest-known
nest, a heap of sand and rubbish sometimes
Bft. high; while the immense enm is satis-
fied with a few handsful of leaves. The
swamp-loving jabiru (Q.) collects a large woodheap
in a tree before depositing the eggs in the top
thereof. The flimsiest stick structure I’ve seen
holds the young of the bronzewing pigeon. You
can see daylight through it anywhere. The white-
fronted heron (blue crane) constructs a stick nest
so flat on top that the eggs remain on it with
difficulty. The rifle-bird has a peculiar liking for
the cast-off skin of a carpet-snake. The blue-faced
honeyeater adopts the deserted nest of a babbler,
slightly renovating the inside fittings before signing
the lease. The babbler itself is a curiosity in the
nesting line, as a family (they are always in flocks)
will build half a dozen bulky nests and not use half
of them. The rare exile grass-warbler of North
Queensland is our boss seamstress. The leaves
inside the nest are sewn together with cobwebs. The
neatest of builders are the robin tribe. Their homes
are beautiful structures of moss, lichen, cobweb and
bark. The magpie is the most casual builder. Any
old thing, from sticks to barbwire can be found
in his nursery, and he’ll dump the home down on a
tussock if no trees are handy. Most of the northern
kingfishers scoop a hole in a white-ants’ nest to hold
their eggs. The beautiful bee-eater is a miner.
He makes a long sloping, tunnel in a sandy bank.
The master-masons are four —swallow, peewit, grey-
jumper and chough. They are all mud builders.

“T. 0.1.”: How the noxious weed, the
Bathurst burr, came to Australia is not generally
known. In the early ’forties there arrived at
Sydney the first shipment of Timor ponies. Of
these Messrs. William Cummings and John Ford each
bought a stallion and three or more mares. Cum-
mings, an M.L.A. for many years, took his lot to
his estate on Clear Creek, a tributary of the Mac-
quarie River. The manes and tails of the ponies
were found to be literally matted with burr-seed,
which, on removal, fell to the ground, took root,
the soil being- congenial, increased and multiplied
with great rapidity. Then the great flood of 1844
swept large quantities of the seed into the river,
by which it became widely distributed over the far
"Western plains. It has cost the country millions
of pounds sterling in the deterioration of wool.
“Lachlander”: Every court day in tlie
rabbit country where there is a P.P. Board sees
dozens of landholders hauled before the beak on a
charge of “failing to destroy,” and the fines range
from £3 to £3O. Most of the cockies and
squatters consider it cheaper to plead guilty
and to pay up than to waste big sums
in digging out and burning off ; and as the

inspectors can only v' it the holdings about once a
year the scheme is an economical one. Occasion-
ally some careful soul fights, and for a
novel defence that of a defendant at Seymour
(Vic.) takes some beating. To the charge he
answered that the rabbits were a plague sent by the
will of God, and could not be got rid of until God
willed it. P.M. Knight unfeelingly told him that
he (the beak) was there by the will of God, and, as
he had to do his duty, he would sting defendant for
£5 and costs. It’s difficult to know who your friends
are these days.

“Lantana” : It lias been demonstrated that,
of nearly all trees, the eucalyptus absorbs the great-
est amount of water. Two seedlings—a huge gum
and a plum—were placed with their roots in water,
and the height of the water carefully marked. The
plants were kept in a warm atmosphere and examined
at the end of 24 hours, when it was found that the
eucalyptus had disposed of four times the quantity
of water that the plum had been able to take up.
Seeing that blue-gums increase in height with great
rapidity, the amount of moisture taken up increases
on a progressive scale. This is what brings
about a settlement with the malarial mosquito. This
insect passes its larval stage in pools of water.
Where the eucalypti grow all marshy places dis-
appear, the breeding spots of the mosquitoes are
gone, and in time the insects vanish altogether.
“Mrs. Lance Rawson” : Apropos of the
shower of shrimps in Singleton (N.S.W.) lately. I
have seen the ground for a radius of about 10 yards
from three to five inches deep in small fry, which
had been carded up in a water-spout from the mouth
of Wide Bay, wafted through the atmosphere for some
miles parallel with Fraser’s Island till the collection
reached higher land, which apparently turned its
course towards the mainland, where it was dis-
charged. Gathered up nine bucketsful of the fish.
Of course, most of them were killed by the fall, but
all were quite usable, and we cooked them like
whitebait. Was once deluged with a shower of mud,
tadpoles, tiny frogs, grasshoppers, sticks, leaves and
other unclean debris. The presentation came from
a whirlwind in drought-time. By the way, someone
made a remark in a recent Bulletin regarding the
use of sea water for boiling potatoes. While living
at the seaside I never used any other water for
culinary purposes. Even the Christmas puddings
were boiled in it, and we never noticed any difference
between it and the fresh water in that capacity.
“ Jesmoud”: I must tell you something
that happened here the other day. Some Aussies
and Tommies were billeted in the same village. The
Tommies got to work quietly and rounded-up all the
fowls and put them in coups to keep them out of
our way. This was 0.K., until one day one of our
battalion cooks caught sight of the ehooks. So, of
course, he investigates and reports. Next day the
Tommies receive a visit from a distressed French) -
who had come after his fowls. The poor chap
pitched such a pitiful tale that the good-natured
Englishmen told him to take his fowls away and
good-luck to him. We had a great feed that day.
Some of the boys can imitate the local inhabitant
to the life. By the way, our lot have been with the
French a lot lately. They are great fellows —never
down-hearted.

“Centurion'’: Re the malaria-quinine argu-
ment. Herewith is the treatment of the Mesopo-
tamia Field Force. It was lent me by a medical pal,
an old friend for many years in N.Q. and Papua.
It is endorsed by all the malarial “heads.” (With
tabloids at 18s. the small bottle, I can't call it a
free-gratis tip) :
Dosage, hydrochloride or bisulphate of quinine
(each tabloid contains 5 grains).—ls grains daily
for six days ; omit quinine treatment for two days. 25
grains daily for three days ; omit quinine treatment
for three days. 15 grains daily for three days; omit
quinine treatment for four days. 15 grains daily for
three days ; omit quinine treatment for five days. 15
grains daily for three days; omit quinine treatment
for six days. 15 grains daily for tfiree days, omit
quinine treatment for seven days. 15 grains daily
for three days; omit quinine treatment for seven
days. 15 grains daily for three days; omit quinine
treatment for seven days. 15 grains.,daily for three
days; omit quinine treatment for seven days.
If at the end of this time the patient is not longer
exposed to infection he is regarded as cured. Should
any relapse take place, or a new infection occur, the
whole scheme must be repeated. Anybody, after such
a cure, still remaining in a malarial-infected district
must be treated prophylactically.
“Sundowner”: I took a cruise round the
Nepean River (N.S.W.) a few weeks ago. Having
nothing worse to do, I inspected some fencing on
the Bringelly-road that I saw put up 54 years ago.
Iron-bark it was, and it was still in a fair state of
preservation, and it promises to keep the other fel-
low’s cattle out for another 10 or 12 years. Also
paid a visit to an old friend whose house was built
in ’6B. The original shingles (iron-bark) are still
inviting the rain to do its worst. The walls,
which are blue-gum weatherboards, hand-sawn in the
pit, have never been overburdened with paint and
are absolutely sound. What’s the matter with this
timber for shipbuilding, presuming we could send
it to America or somewhere?

THE MEAT SUPPLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our salted horse is finished; it was very scarce of
late,
We couldn’t get from squatter Baines a scrap for
love or pelf.
So father said to Sarah, after breakfast, “Sure as
fate,
Before I die fer want o’ beef I’ll kill me bloomin’
self.”
We're joyous at the prospect of some bloodshed at
our place—
Excepting father, who believes the scheme has
turned our heads —
There’s lightness in Mum’s footsteps and a gladness
in her face,
And Sarah hums a martial air what time she
makes the beds,
Bill grinds the axe and butcher's knife and yards
the fatted steer ;
And father puts his pipe aside and reaches down
the gun,
And Mum, preparing pickle in the shed, calls, “Sarah
dear,
Just take the children all inside until your father’s
done.”
A sly hawk hovers overhead, the crows hang round
the pen ;
\ butcher-bird in silence waits and dryly whets
his bill.
Arid Brown, our neighbor, brings us down the car-
cases of a hen.
“It’s strange,” says mum, “he never fails to call
the day we kill.”
The tragedy is over and our kitchen reeks of bec-f.
Brown has a quarter in his cart; our cask is
almost filled.
Says Mum to Bill, “It’s extra work, but Lor’ it's
great relief
At such a trying time as this to know your father’s
killed.”

"F.S.S.": “We,. Bobbie" (B. S/S/’IS) is
confounding two different birds when he says: “In
my wanderings in Australia l never saw the eagle-
hawk swoop on to fish, yet fish is chiefly the prey
of the bird here in the Solomons. .. .The length of
wing' (of two shot) from tip to tip was 70 inches.”
Tlie so-called eagleliawk is the wedgetailed eagle,
the largest known eagle in the world, and is
restricted to Australia' and Tasmania. Its wing-
spread is commonly over 7ft. A giant was killed
at Wooroowuolgen (N.s.W.) in Jan., | t
measured Bft, Oin. from tip to lip of wings, 4ft. I in.
from point of beak to tip of tail and weighed 17,1 ib.
Mulyan, the wedgetail, feeds on carrion, rats, rabbits,
ft'-. Sometimes, when this sort of food is scarce, he
" d lift young lambs; blit: I have never heard of
him doing any fishing. The wide-wandering whist-
ling eagle picks up floating food, and the white-
bi-llied sea -eagle, which roams from the Malay to
Australia and over Oceana, lives on dead fish and
shellfish. The. white-headed osprey, commonly
known as the fish-hawk, is another big laird with a
wide range which lives on fish. None of these rnav
be “Wee Robbie’s” eagleliawk, as there are plentv
of- eagles among the distant islands which do not
reach Australia.
ir.\.B. : The Pctroica (Australian
robin) family includes a dusky, large-eyed species
which has a most singular nesting habit. The cup-like
nest of fine bark, lined with cow- or horse-hair or
wool, is most frequently built on a mound of
manure, but writer lias in one instance discovered
the egg-factory mounted on a clod of earth. This
stiange habit the bird must have acquired since the
introduction of domestic livestock to Australia.
THE OLD DESTINATION.
TRAVELLING PARSON : "Em afraid, friend.
we can't, agree on religion; hat. after
all, we’re hath maltin' for the same
place, aren’t we?"
BILL: "That's right, Sport; air after we’re
’ad a few, we’ll forget all about our little
argument”
THE PROOF.
LIZ: " D’yer lore me, Snorky."
SNORKY: "Lore yer! Ptrike me. I do.”
LAZ (coyly): "How d’yer know?"
SNORKY: "Well, ain't I wastin' me time with yon?”
'Satan : I support "A. Field" with refer-
ence to the bi-sexual paw-paw. The late <'. li.
Steele, (lympie (Q.), obtained the best results in
ill-* district with the vegetables. lie commenced
with the ordinary plants, which all turned out to
b" females. No fruit was 1 orne until some male
flowers were obtained and placed in a handy position.
As a result the grower obtained some bi-sexual
plants which bore both flowers. The female blossom
on the short stalk produced the fruit. In 1913 fruit
uas actually produced on the long stems carrying
the maJe flowers. This fruit was of a coarse and
unpalatable nature.
r,ddys:on : Mugridge lived in a lug hut at
I’eewee, a log hut of ordinary dimensions, parti-
tioned with slabs into two apartments, neither large
enough to hang a cafiii, But Mugridge' kept a
housekeeper. Mugridge'* housekeeper was a dark,
sour woman named Ann. much too
huge for her office. Probably lie-
cause his housekeeper could only get
indoors with difficulty, Mugridge did
all the housework himself, while
Ann sat out under the hark shelter,
favorably known as the front veran-
dah, and had another drink or
wished she had another drink. When
I had been in Peeweo a week. I met
Mugridge taking a Sunday-afternoon
•‘■troll with his family. There were
six of them, the eldest 13, the
youngest perhaps seven months. The
kids were unwashed and in a
lamentable state of disrepair, and
Mugridge was pushing the baby
(stuccoed with treacle and flies) in
a. perambulator of his own design
and construction, ■ the body of
which was the half of a medium
beer-keg split longitudinally, and
the wheels wore of solid gum sawn
from a found log. I complimented
Mug-ridge on the length and appar-
ent stability- of his family. “Ah,
ves,’ answered the poor man, “but
they take a lot iv bringin’ up. speci-
• ;.-y when a man’s got his ban's
full iv other things. Their mother
'licil when the eldest was three months old, >u> r V e
hin.tendin' 'em ever since.’’

trilled Lizard : This is my commendable
method of tanning kangatoo skins. Remove all useless
paits, and soak the skin soft. Then separate any flesh,
and leave pelt in warm water for one hour. Now take
for each skin, borax, saltpetre and glaubev salts,, of
each half an ounce, and wet with water sufficiently
to allow spreading. I’ut on with a brush, thickest
in the thick part ot the skill, double tip anil'put" in
a cool place for 24 hours. After that wash skin
clean and take sal. soda (loss.), borax ( },oz.), white
soap (■>(>'/..), melt them together on a slow ftre, but
do not allow them to boil, and apply the mixture
to the flesh side the same as before. Double up
again and put in a warm place for 24 hours. After
tins, wash clean again and have salaratus (20z.) dis-
solved in hot water sufficient to well saturate the
skin, then take alum <4oz.), common salt (So/. )
and dissolve in hot water. When it is cool enough
not to scald, put the skin in and leave for h
Imurs. Wring out and hang- up to dry. Repeat
this last process from two to four times according
to the softness required. Afterwards finish o ff with
sand-paper and pumice-stone. This is the method
used by all furriers when tanning furs for coats, etc.
■'Jay I*ay": To support the statement of
' l - 1 - ( l! - 1/ J IS) that many of our wild birds
become thoroughly tame when accustomed to man,
there's a meatworks in North Queensland where any

increasing, Bill continued: “But, lady, if s „ ot the
loss of the swag I care about, or the £5; but mv
poor okl dear mother’s photo was in tha bmidTe
and I’ve carried it about with me ever since I
a boy. That photo was a guiding star in hours
of temptation and kept me straight, ilanv a time
when m bad company I’ve been on the 'ver-e of

started a collection and .eventually this resulted in
Bill receiving about £lO. llis gratitude as he

who is surprised at the bi-sexuality of paw-paws that
while the female plant usually does all the produc-
ing, cases of male trees fruiting are not uncommon.
A masculine pa-paiya that grew in front of tlie big.
whitewashed bungalow which used to be Government
House at Port Moresby (Papua) bore clusters of
Unit for a number of years. The fruit contained
seeds and seemed identical in every way with the
legitimately-produced article. In a village garden
near the Solomon Island port of Gizo the natives
carefully treasured one of these vegetables. it was
tabooed and the fruit was allowed to rot. An
inquisitive white man managed to obtain some or,
the seeds and plant them. They grew well and"
quickie, but the resulting trees were genuine males.
Incidentally “Chloe” is wrong in stating that male
and female paw-paws must grow in pairs. Provided
there is plenty of pollen-carrying insects-—such as G
the case in the tropics—-one male is sufficient for a
hundred of the other sex.
It was the dance hall of a Banana-
land bush town, and the hop was in aid of
the Anglican and ii. <'. Churches. At 8.30 a girl,
who had recently lost a near relation, entered clad
in deep black. 'She sat and moped in the corner, and
no bloke had the heart to approach her. At last one
01 the boys went up and asked her for a dance. She
fell gracefully into his arms murmuring. “So w.

•' : Recently holidaying in Bamum-
laiul I was shown two distinct colonics of bees
inhabiting pipes on opposite sides, of an old-man
blue-gum. Is it unusual for rival hives to live
on the same- trees? The debaters up north are
breaking . crockery and spilling beer over it.
Bill Bo vyang”: I met him leading horses
to water at Jericho (Palestine) the other dav, ami

occurred m a certain X.Q. port years back. In
those days Trooper Bill was carrying Matilda about
he fsoith, and one day he found himself stranded
at Bowen. The great event of the week in Bowen
those days was the arrival of the mail steamer on
Sunday afternoon, and the population of the town
dressed m its best, used to walk down the jettv’
to meet each other and gaze at the latest arrivals.
Bill reached the end of the jetty with a hea'vv swag,

THE SAUSAGES OF SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When all the world is one glad shout
Of welcome to the Spring-;
W hen all wealth of wattle’s out
And blithe is everything;
The poets lilt about the birds;
But not of them I sing:
Tor only one theme I have words —-
The sausages of Spring !
W hen gone is winter’s discontent
Of sausages I think.
How tender and how succulent,
And oh! how sweetly pink!
■some think of tender green of crops,
And some of jonquils sing ;
But, oh, they drape the butchers’ shops,
The sausages of Spring!
All winter’s cares 1 gladly flout,
Spring’s message is so clear:
The early sausages are out;
The sausage season’s here !
The vegetarian heedeth not
The fragrance that they fling;
And I rejoice they haven’t got
The sausages of Spring!
The birds are like myself in this;
Their song the theme affirms.
They warble of the coming bliss
Of juicy sausage worms!
And Life's done everything it tan,
And breakfast’s just the thing,
When they are sizzling in the pan,
The sausages of Spring!

The habit of intrigue once having laid hold of him
the tendencies which nearly always accompany it
were not slow to show themselves, and issued in
acts towards former fellow workers and friends of
a nature which not only destroyed old ties of inti-
macy, but which no considerations of political expe-
diency or anything else could, as most of us thought,
morally justify. Champion’s intrigues were mainly
connected with the Tory party through acquaintances
of doubtful political antecedents on the fringe of
that party.
They are the reminiscences of a scholar and
a student rather than of a man of action —
and a not uninteresting circumstance is that
the commentaries are those of a vehement
anti-feminist and of one who would have
regarded anti-shouting as a revelation of
dementia. Bax is a very stalwart anti-
wowser.

describes and analyses the methods of 20
of the most eminent English workers
in this mediujn. Matania, the journalistic
war illustrator, is a wonder if the letterpress
is as true as an affidavit. His involved
battle compositions are practically thrown
on the paper without any preliminary fid-
dling about, and, instead of building up his
picture gradually, he works almost at
random, completing half a figure here and a
horse’s head there till his paper is an extra-
ordinary jumble. Yet he visualises the scene
so accurately that the spaces left vacant are
exactly filled in. His memory for the details
of equipment, etc., of all the combatant
armies makes his painstaking contemporaries
blink.
“0.L.”: Owing to the high price of secre-
taries, stationery, office-rent and Arbitration
Court proceedings, the Victoria district of
the A.J.A. has decided to raise its subscrip-
tion rates from Is. a week to £3 a year for
full-fledged daily-paper men, who will in
future be granted free club privileges. The
rate is to go up from 20s. to 30s. a year for
country members, women, cadets, contribu-
tors and district news-gatherers, who will be
expected to pay ss. a year extra for their
club facilities, the increase thus being much
heavier on the people who have mostly had
no benefit from the Ass. The rule regarding
the fining of members in arrears is also to be
brought into force, and everything should
now be well for the concern —-except, perhaps,
in regard to the swelling of its membership-
roll.
The Huns have got hold of a valuable
British journalistic curiosity—the first
issue of the London Gazette, the oldest of
English newspapers,- and the only copy of
that issue belonging to the British Govern-
ment, the proprietors of this venerable
official journal. Frederick Atterbury, the
head of the Government Stationery Office,
recently mentioned that a few days before
the outbreak of the war he lent this precious
possession to a German exhibition of the
art of printing.
Died of wounds in France on August 8,
Corporal George 11. Ilambidge, after what
appears to have been his first battle after a
long period of training. Although a South
Australian, he enlisted in the 46th Infantry
(Victoria) rather than again don civilian’s
attire in S.A. after disbandment of his unit
(reinforcements for mortars). He was
a frequent contributor of good copy to
The Bulletin and other Australian papers,
notably the Register, and composed the
verses for a successful patriotic song, “When
the Boys Come Home.” At time of enlisting
he had completed his first year in the legal
course as articled clerk to Messrs. Poole and
Johnstone, Adelaide. Only 21.
An honorable and legitimate premium to
reporters is the one provided for as a be-
quest in the will of the late Joseph Pulitzer,
editor and proprietor of the New York
World. He endowed Columbia University
with a prize of 1000 dollars to be awarded
annually “for the best example of a reporter’s
work during the year, the test being strict
accuracy, terseness and the accomplishment
of some public good, commanding public
attention and respect.” Harold A. Little-
dale, a gunner in the British Tank Corps in
the French war zone, is the latest winner.
He has been sending his paper, the New
York Evening Post, a series of remarkably
vivid and well-written articles on his experi-
ences and observations at the Front, but
the particular piece of work that gained him
the Pulitzer prize was done before he be-
came a soldier —the exposure of a number
of abuses in the New Jersey State prison.
“Umntu”: The fall of the pressmen
at the hurdle marked “shoneen” (B.
22/8/T8) calls to mind what is perhaps the
biggest flop that a Sydney paper ever came
in the daily scurry on the Inky Way. On
May 6, 1877, the Sydney Morning Herald
received a cable which ran. “Two Thou-
sand Chamant Brown Prince Silvio.”
Instead of this being handed to the Sport-
ing Editor for the joy or depression of rac-
ing men, it was, for some inexplicable rea-
son, treated as a war cable, and the next
morning the Herald had, as an exclusive
piece of news about the Russo-Turkish war,
the following account of a “Russian victory” :
“Two thousand men, under Chamat Chroun
and Prince Silvio, with several ironclads,
had an engagement with the Russian bat-
teries at Ibrahila or Brahilor. They bom-
barded the town and withdrew.”
Business, Bobbery, etc.
At a Pleasant Sunday Afternoon in Mel-
bourne W. H. Edgar, well-known for his
pious works, made a remark or two: —
Some men had asked him why he didn’t speculate
in wheat certificates. .. .It is criminal for any man
to speculate in foodstuffs. It was terrible to consider
that men, women and children might be going- to bed
hungry for want of food that rapacious individuals
had cornered to enrich themselves. The profiteer
should be compelled to sacrifice all he possessed.
These preaching men of book-learning and
book platitudes are really funny. Reading
such stories as “The Pit,” which dealt with
Chicago wheat gambling, the thing is very
horrible. But there is very poor chance of
cornering an article unless it is scarce. The
pile of wheat that we can’t get away is so
tremendous that one might as well try to
corner sea-water or dust-storms. And no-
body can really gamble in wheat, because
the Government buys it at a fixed price, but
it is possible to gamble in certificates, be-
cause the Government pays a certain amount
and gives its certificate, bond, debenture,
share, uninscribed stock—-one name is as
good as another —which promises a certain
balance and something more if the luck is
good. A pious man complained bitterly
about “gambling” when these papers were
quoted on the Stock Exchange, and turned
into investments, or poker chips just as you
used them, but the farmers laughed. When
there was no quotation ilw pious heavy
father in the township used to give perhaps
34d. per bushel as a favor for a security
which, so the farmer learned by the daily
paper when the public gambling began, was
worth perhaps Is. or more. Some people
speculate at the published figures and win;
some do the same and lose. But if nobody
speculated then the farmer who can't afford
to wait for his money would only have the
pawnshop to go to. Nobody can corner
wheat, for the Government, which is the
people, runs the only corner there is. But
a lot of people, in the name of piety, get
very cross over the open and public trading
in certificates. The old hole-and-corner
method paid much better. Certainly the
best thing of all would be for the Govern-
ment to find ships, and shove the wheat
promptly on the world’s market, and pay
cash in full. But for want of the ships and
the cash the certificate seems inevitable, and
unless people bought it for sordid motives it
would be worth very little. If philanthro-
pists would put up a fund to buy certificates
without sordid motives it would make a
difference; but they don’t.
* * * *
“8.J.”: Those who comnlain loudest of
the long-postponed action of the Melbourne
dailies in increasing the price of the Satur-
day issue to 2d. are a number of suburban
shopkeepers who had discovered that, with
paper at its present price, it was a payable
proposition to buy a few dozen copies of a
20- or 24-page penny paper for wrapping
purposes.
* * * *
Last season Victoria’s Forest Department
planted 00,000 young pine trees in its Har-
court nursery, and lately some interfering
person coaxed the local fruitgrowers’ associa-
tion to go and look at them. The excursion-
ists found 95 per cent, had been destroyed,
mostly by rabbits, and said so to the Depart-
ment with caustic comments. _ But that
section of the Public Service didn’t get huffy.
It merely assured the complainants that it
would “take every precaution to suppress the
pest before this year’s planting.” As this
took place last June and July the Depart-
ment is evidently going to hustle itself.
* * * *
A grievance that the Papua rubber pro-
ducers claim against the Federal Govern-
ment is a trifle compared with the con-
sumers’ grievance. The price the producers
are allowed to charge to manufacturers is
two-thirds lower than it was before the war,
whereas manufacturers, with full liberty to
charge what they like to the “trade,” have
raised their prices in a fine elevating spirit.
At the recent half-yearly meeting of the
Domara River Plantations Ltd. a shareholder
contrasted the reports of a local rubber manu-
facturing co. and a rubber plantation co.
The former announced a profit of £48,000 as
against £26,000 for the previous year; the
latter, handicapped by its agreement to sell
at the Singapore market quotation, sliowec
no profit at all.
THE SCALEWAY SYSTEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The huge joke of the Vic. railway system is the
recent stealing of some 30 big bales of flannel, sent
from Geelong mills to the order of the Defence De-
partment, from a shed at Spencer-street station.
Not very long ago some thieves, equally audacious,
marched off with over £3OO worth of sheep from
the trucks. Thefts of trifles like truck-loads of
bricks and 20 tons of potatoes are too numerous to
mention, and are not mentioned (probably for that
reason) unless some interfering outsider drags the
matter into the light of day.
It is a railway system big
With wisest heads, and ably manned
By officers in gilded fig.
Their schemes and notions, gravely planned
Work admirably upon the whole
There is an expert squad to note if
Aught slips or twists. They say the sole
Lament arose when villains stole
A station or a locomotive.
The officers innumerable
Were so absorbed in cleric duties
That row and then a truck of wool,
Or two of wethers—fatted beauties —•
From off the premises cajoled
(Some people thought it food for laughter)
Were by the city brigands bold
In shop or open market sold,
And rarely ever heard of after.
The thieves removed a shed of spuds
All in the blazing light of day.
A traction engine from its studs
They pinched to wheel the goods away,
And no one ever seems to know
How come or go these lawless reapers.
In other railways in a row
The wooden sleepers lie below,
Here over all are placed the sleepers.'
VICTORIA.

“Adamax” Roofing, the Best Roofing
Value in the World.
The roofing that costs one=third the price of
galvanised=iron —
That resists all the elements—heat, wind, cold,
rain, acids or chemical fumes —
That is easy to lay—
That costs less to buy and less for upkeep—
“ The best roofing that money can buy.”
If “Adamax” was not the best roofing value it would not have been used on
the following jobs:—
43} miles of “Adamax” Roof Covering were
used on Wool=storage Sheds erected in
Wentworth Park, Sydney, by Messrs. Stuart
Bros, for the Central Wool Committee.
Again, recently. 13 miles of “Adamax” Roof
Covering were ordered by the Imperial
Authorities in Perth for the West Australian
Wool Stores.
22,000 sq. yds. for use on the Commonwealth Buildings
at Molongo, Canberra
20,000 sq. yds. on the Leeton Canning Factories.
13,200 sq. yds. for W.A. Govt. Freezing Works at
Wyndham.
An order for 44,000 sq. yds. was placed for use on the
South Australian Wheat Board Buildings.
The contracts for the N.S.W. Railways for 1917=18 and
again for 1918=19 were secured for “Adamax” Roofing,
the estimated requirements for the year being 25,000
sq. yds.
With such
confidence.

To Know the Rexona
Remedies is to Like Them.
gd
HAT natural beauty of skin and hair
which cannot be imitated can be
obtained by regular use of Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary
Toilet Soaps do not assert this influ-
ence. Many of them contain free
alkali, which tends to dry the skin and destroy
its delicate texture. Even the best of such
soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and
protect the skin. Rexona Soap contains the
same soothing, healing, antiseptic balsams as
Rexona the Rapid Healer, the value of which
in the treatment of skin affections is known
throughout the world. Simply use Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap regularly once or twice
a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe and
cleanse the pores, lessen the tendency to
pimples, and leave the complexion (dear, fresh
and velvety. Price 1/- per tablet.
ftf
Miss NAD A CONRADE (.fruit i a jilio-to).
Dear Sirs, —I am sending you my photograph, as I
want to join your Rexona girls, for I consider that I am
truly one. I have been using your Rexona and Rexona
Soap now for over a year, and consider them both
excellent. I 'have found Rexona most healing and a
wonderful skin remedy.
Rexona Soap is certainly quite unsurpassed as a Toilet
and Medicated Soap. I think it is simply delightful,
and would never consider ever using any other kind
again. I am also enclosing three Rexona Wrappers,
which I have taken from the Soap, and wish you would
please send me one of your Bubble Pipes, which I notice
you advertise to give with each three Wrappers from
Rexona Soap posted to you.
I hear that Rexona Soap is now the most used of any
Soap in Australia, and I am sure it deserves to be.
Yours truly,

Rexona Soap I find invaluable for my liair, complexion

RAYMOND and ERNEST PRIOL (from a pnoro).
REXONA Needed
in Every Home.
Dear Sirs, —I have for
some time used your Rexona
Soap and Rexona Ointment
for my haby boy, Raymond,
aged two, and my older boy,
Ernest, aged five, and I am
dropping you a line to let
you know how good I have
found them. Their skin is
quite soft and clear, and
shows the good results of
using Rexona.
I always keep a tin of
Rexona Ointment in the
house, handy, in the event of
any accident, and I always
make it a rule to bath both
my children with Rexona
Soap, for I think it is un-
equalled for children. I am
sending you a photo of both
children, one representing
.Tack Cannot and the other
Leslie Holland. They have
won prizes in fancy costumes
at Eslick’s Palladium. Manly
Carnival, Rondi Carnival,
Leichhardt Carnival and
many others. They have
been much admired every-
where, and I know are true
Rexona children, and I can
honestly say always will be.
Wishing Rexona every suc-
cess, I am, yours truly,
(Sgd.) LILIAN D. PRIOL.
81 Campbell Street,
Glebe.
Dear Sirs, —I think every
mother should have a pot of
Rexona on hand, for it is
simply wonderful how often
one has to fly to it for one
cause or another. I have
been using Rexona myself,
also for my little girl
Dimples, and it would hon-
estly be a hardship now to
try to get along without it.
Whenever my little girl
hurts herself in any w T ay she
always runs to me for some
Rexona, and I can truthfully
say it never disappoints us,
for it always heals and so
quickly cures.
Knowing how good Rexona
was, I bought some Rexona
Soap recently to try it also,
and I And it delightful. I
shall always stick by Rexona,
for it is an article of true
merit, and my little girl says
she is a Rexona girl, and
always will be.
Sincerely yours,
(Sgd.)

Specimen Section of a
“COLO" Tyre
Eight Points of the “COLO” Tyre
(1) IRE AD.—Corrugated, presenting small sur-
face to tlie road, thereby saving friction.
(2) TREAD.—A great thickness of rubber, which
is practically cut- and chip-proof.
(3) BREAKER STRIP, which, being made of
loosely-woven, heavy fabric, binds the tread
to the carcase of the tyre.
(4) PURE RUBBER.—Pure Rubber is placed
under Breaker Strip.
(5) CARCASE.—Composed of five plies of heavy,
long-fibre canvas, heavily impregnated with
rubber.
(6) FULL AIR SPACE.
(7) SIDE WALLS.—Realising the severe work
tyres are called upon to do in the country,
we have placed a great thickness of rubber on
the side walls, preventing water from entering,
as often happens in other makes of tyres after
a few months’ service. Other makes have
very little thickness of rubber at this point.
(8) BEADS are heavily reinforced and skin-
coated with rubber, to prevent rust.

The announcement in London Tit-Bits
that Melba has just celebrated her 75th
birthday is one of those mistakes which
worry theatrical artists in their later years,
or earlier years, in some cases. Dolores, for
instance, as long as she appeared under the
name of Trebelli, was often mistaken in
paragraphs for her famous mother. Tit-
Bits, in saying that Melba made her debut
at the New York Academy of Music when
she was 16, and “over half a century has
elapsed since her voice first charmed an
audience.” was confusing her with Adelina
l-.atti. of course. Patti is. at least 76 next
birthday, for she made her first appearance
Garden Opera House, London, in
May, 1861. The world, apparently, has
already begun to forget Patti, although it is
not so many years ago that she was still
“PIERROT PIE” AT SYDNEY
PLAYHOUSE.
Some Joe Brennan characters.
trading on her reputation and the remnants
of her voice. The girlish characters she
played to perfection—Zerlina in “Don Gio-
vanni,” the damsel in “La Somnambula,” etc.
—were mostly old-fashioned ere she dropped
out of opera and restricted her bright little
personality to the concert platform. The
musical world has a grievance against Adel-
lna Patti. She created the awful popularity
ot that mawkish Yankee ballad. “Home,
Sweet Home.” Because she sang it her ch.ef
contemporaries, Christine Nillson and Albani,
had to show the public they could sing it as
well as the slim little woman, or better.
Melba had to sing it at her first concert after
her return to Australia. A lot of people
regard it as a great song and a supreme
test o± emotional power in the vocalist.
“Snake”: “The Invisible Foe,” which
hardly appeals to Melbourne’s fancy, w r as a
fan success at the London Savoy, probably
owing to the efforts of a capital cast. Richard
Bransby, played here moderately well by
Harmon Lee, was artistically exploited by
Sydney Valentine, a convincing portrayer of
peevish old men. As for Cyril Mackay’s
melodramatic rendering of Stephen Pryde,
it would hardly compare with H. B. Irvine's
sardonic impersonation, which included some
ot the uncanny horror and occasional green
limelight which Irving employed for Mat-
r^ ia f- n^ e Bells.” Fay Compton, the
English Helen,, was, however, not much
ahead of Ernelie Polini, who mafces the
character more winsome.
,~! J V -£ Tot sati sfied with a reputation
I * UP® ll gloomy things like “The
Sightless, I elieas and Melisande” and
Interior, Maurice Maeterlinck has written
a humorous play in a modern setting, “The
“ Gran'dud Rudd.” at
Sydney Palace.
Mr. Banks (Willie
Driscoll) looks in.
Miracle of St. An-
thony.” Maeter-
linck cannot forget
death even in his
lighter moments, so
chooses for this
theme the attempc
of a saint, who
looks like a sun-
downer, to bring to
life a rich old
woman, just when
friends and rela-
tives have arrived
to hurry her under
the sod and get to
work on dividing
the estate. Th e
impudence of the
saint in Suggesting
that the tomb is
not yet ripe arouses
the anger of his
worldly opponents and affords excellent
opportunities for humor and satire.
“D.F.”: There was a present-day touch
about the name of the first play ever put on
a stage in Australia. On June 4, 1789, some
of the convicts played Farquliar’s comedy,
“The Recruiting Officer,” in a hut at Sydney
that had been fitted up for the purpose. A
spectator related that the co. professed no
higher aim than “humbly to excite a smile,”
and that its efforts to please were not un-
attended with success.
“Camelero”: The picture shows and
variety theatres which sprang up like mush-
rooms when Billjim first invaded Egypt have
since been put to other uses. The Tivoli at
/eitoum, where poor Tom Dawson headed
the bill for several weeks, is now used as an
officers’ mess-hut, and the National at Tel-el-
Kebir has been turned into a laundry for
Indian troops. The Alhambra at Heliopolis
was bought by a Gyppo carpenter, who built
a homo for himself with the timber. War
is a great leveller.
‘D.”: The management should have made
a special announcement of the fact that Mar-
garet Wycherly was attempting a middle-
aged Irishwoman as Rosalie La Grange in
.1 he Thirteenth Chair.” I heard one
admirer—a newspaper proprietor at that —
J Wycherly excellent as the
old German woman?” and having seen Miss
Wycherly I don’t stand amazed at his error.
What time Miss Wycherly’s voice was dis-
coverable at all in Melb. Royal it conveyed
an idea of an Irishwoman of Italian descent
trying to speak Frenchified English with a
mixed accent. By the way, the alleged
mystery attaching to the culprit in the play
is. made glaringly obvious to a dramatic in-
stinct very early by the author’s too strenu-
ous efforts to avert suspicion from him
while pointedly attaching it to everybody
else.
Just three and a half years ago Madeline
Collins sang her farewell songs in Sydney
Town Hall preparatory to sailing away to
make use of a Royal Academv scholarship
which she had won as a pupil of St. Vin-
cent s Convent. She has now scored a strik-
ing London success in Gounod’s “Romeo and
Juliet, ’ as prima donna of the Beecham
Opera Company at Drury-lane. This opera
Melba made peculiarly her own. All the
musical critics are unanimous in their
praises and prophecies of a brilliant career
for this latest Australian songbird, who is
in her twenties.
“T.A.” : The Conservatorium of Music is
in for some special music directly. Some
few weeks ago the Workers’ Educational
Association sent a deputation to those in
charge, and came away with an arrangement
that members of affiliated organisations w r ere
to share with W.E.A. members and students
in the enjoyment of concert concession rates.
Then the clause in the agreement referring to
members of affiliated organisations was
hurriedly withdrawn by the Minister, or
Under-Secretary, or somebody, and those
affected don’t like it. To make things worse
somebody has blabbed that a seat reserved
for a year costs him at the rate of between
15 and 1(1 pence per concert.
“Goldsborough” : Australian baritone Peter
Dawson has got a corporal’s stripes at
Enoggera camp (Q.). The only fly in the
dixie is that everyone running a concert puts
pressure on Dawson for half a dozen songs,
and so hot did the cadge for melody become
that he had to shut down heavily.
“Harrison O.”: Gregan McMahon’s Mel-
bourne Repertory Theatre, which is not lost
but gone over to the Taits, did excellent work
during its seven years of existence as a
purely repertory organisation. It pre-
sented 57 plays and many were revived from
time to time. Shaw, with seven pieces to
his credit, was the most frequently-produced
author, as he has been in practically all
British repertory ventures. Ibsen came
second with a tally of four, and St.. John
Hankin third, with three. Fourteen plays
by local writers were aired. The Aus-
tralian dramatists staged were Louis
ksson. Alt' Buchanan, Mary Wilkinson, E.
H. Oliphant, Arthur Adams, Blamire Young,
Billy Moore, Edward Dyson and Kathleen
Watson Dearden. Some impressive locallv
manufactured music by the late Marshall
7i»t™ r Australian Gilbert Murray’s version
°f ’ fbe Trojan Woman” was played. The
amateur casts, in which performers were
chosen because of their resemblance to the
author s characters, often succeeded in get-
ting nearer to life than do the more talented
but, less various craftsmen of the commercial
theatre. _ The Taits are seized ivith the
proper spirit, for in their repertory cos. there
will be no “stars.” the mime who announces
that the carriage waits will receive the
same fee as the lady -who yearns through
three acts and commits suicide in the fourth.
«-r> IL‘4dam” (B. 15/8/T8) and
Peter” (B. 29/8/18) are correct, Mary
I lcktord herself is wrong, for she says that
her maiden name was Gladys Smith, and
that she was born (1893) in Toronto. She
made her first stage appearance in the same
city five years later. Her widowed mother
was playing with the Valentine Stock co.
™ *B'ootle’s Baby,” and Mary, the eldest
child, was the baby. Subsequently she
accompanied her mother on the road, taking
che-ild” parts in melodrama. She went to
the Biograph studio as an “extra,” eventu-
ally became a lead and starred with Harold
Lockwood in “Tess of the Storm Country.”
W hue with Biograph she played opposite
Owen Moore, and is now his wife. When
BeJasco was producing “A Good Little
Devu, the fairy drama by Rosemohde
Gerard and Maurice Rostand, he engaged
Mary Pick ford for an important part and.
he says, “Her success in the difficult role of
the little blind girl was phenomenal. Nothing
like her remarkable performance of a child’s
part had ever been seen in New York or
elsewdiere. Her reward came when she was
sought by managers with such eagerness
that she commanded the highest salary paid
to any screen-actress in the world.”
“Bax”: Heard a good story of old Luttich,
musician, now a long time dead, who was a
Melbourne identity for about 40 years. The
versatile artist (he could play every blessed
instrument in the catalogue) was lying sick
unto death at his lodgings when a friendly
pub-keeper came to look him up. The
buoyant visitor was shocked to find the old
bachelor coughing away in a stuffy bedroom,
with a couple of big dogs sprawling on the
bed, or round about. Pushing the window
up he said, “Get some air into the room,
man, and get rid of the dogs filling the
place with fleas.” In a weak and wheezy
voice Luttich protested: “It isn’t the dogs
that bring the fleas; it's the pupils.”
. Prompter”: Isn’t “Fax” (B.
-J/8/18) in error when he attributes the
authorship of “The Dictator” to Justin
I think he will find that the
Willie Collier cornedv was written by an
American—the late Richard Harding Davis.
Fa * confuses “The Dictator" with
’The Candidate,” which McCarthy skilfullv
adapted from the French. But that again, I
think, was before “wireless” was heard of.
“O. Blin”: To my way of hearing, Stella
Power and Peggy Center have the same cold
aloof voice and semi-detached manner which
in Melba’s protegees are almost historical
These two are only heartfelt in the technics
DE GTLIO.

of their art, the only difference between them
being matters of tone and timbre, which all
the dead-levelling methods of voice-produc-
tion can never overcome. Stella has the
sweeter voice of the two, but she is no less
reminiscent than Peggy of Melba’s own
purity of utterance. And hereabouts I should
say that the young artists have become the
prtma donna’s pets through their endeavors
to model themselves in the likeness of their
creator.
“L.L.W.”: About the novelty of using the
film in “Business Before Pleasure,” has
everyone forgotten Bland Holt’s old drama,
produced in Sydney over 15 years ago, in
which. Arthur Styan used to be caught in
the toils of a breach-of-promise case through
the agency of a tell-tale film? Can’t remem-
ber the name of the piece, but remember dis-
tinctly the faint and flickering film which
used to be shown during a theatre-within-a-
theatre scene.

A few years ago a municipal electrical enter-
prise was established in Goulburn, and the
competition has rather seriously affected this
little 40 years’ old gas co. It is clear that
the co. will have to do better than it did
during the past half-year if the present 8
p.c. dividend is to be maintained. A com-
parison of the balance-sheet figures over
five years gives this: —

Assets other than fixed assets .. £2821 £5689
Liabilities .. .. .. .. 511 511
Surplus £2310 £5178
That shows an improvement of £2B6S in the
surplus of liquid assets over liabilities in the
five years. Probably some of that accumula-
tion will be called for to pay for plant re-
newals. The co.’s position is comfortable,
for it owes nothing beyond the £4(59 to sun-
dry creditors and the consumers’ deposits.

“A. Borig” writes :
Considering the financial future of Australia in
connection with its gold exportation, it seems to me
that the ultimate result must be chaos. I have
been thinking this matter over, and have
evolved a scheme which may or may not be prac-
ticable for relieving the trouble. It would appear
that if a note issue of any country has a backing
of from 40 to 50 p.c. of gold, it is a gilt-edged
security. Throughout Australia there are htw*
dreds, perhaps thousands, of gold-mines which will
not pay dividends to Private Enterprise. Some will
pay 50 p.c. of working expenses, some 75 p.c., and a
few may even pay 90 p.c. None is any good to
the capitalist, but if the Government, working under
the note issue with a gold guarantee of anything' over
40 p.c., could produce, say, £5O worth of gold
with £lOO worth of notes, it would appear to be a
good proposition, within certain limitations. Of
course it could only be done by a Government or
community, and since there is plenty of gold still
underground, ought not some effort be made to get
it out, even at a (note) loss ?
The yarn is interesting and deserves a few
comments:—•
(1) In the first place, a backing of 40 or 50 p.c.
of gold doesn’t necessarily make a note issue good.
A backing of 20 or less p.c. may do so, and a
backing of 70 or 80 p.c. may not. If a country has
a use for £10,000,000 worth of notes —if it really
wants that amount in its daily transactions —then
the Government may issue that amount, and keep
£2,000,000 of gold against it, and promise that
the Treasurer will give gold for ever.' note on
demand, and be quite safe. The notes won’t come
in to be cashed to any visible extent. But if you
give the same people £100,000,000 in notes, with
the same promise to pay—if you make them take
the notes by buying gold or coal or wheat or paying
wages with them or in any other way—and keep
£70,000,000 in gold to meet the liability, the Gov-
ernment will burst. The people will present
£90,000,000 of notes to be cashed, and the
£70,000,000 gold reserve will be insolvent.
(2) The trouble may be staved off to some extent
by persuading banks to hold a vast mass of notes
and not present them till a better time comes, but
even that dodge has its limits. When the banks
have handed over all the gold they can spare
without going broke, and taken paper that doesn’t
bear interest in return, then the trick has been
worked to its limit.
(3) It is certain the Government, which is the
community, couldn't work “hundreds, perhaps
thousands” of gold-mines. It takes far more rigid
discipline than any Australian Government dreams of
to make such a vast series of enterprises pay for
greasing the machinery.
(4) The Government (i.e., the community) can
support the gold industry by buying the gold out-
put at more than its present value. In other words,
it can subsidise or pay a bonus to the industry,
making very sure, of course, that it isn’t paying the
bonus on imported gold, or on its own old sovereigns
melted down. (In the latter case it ftiight be subsi-
dising goldfields that died years ago.) But it
would have to tax the people (in paper) to pay the
subsidy. If it issued new paper, even if it kept
60 p.c. of gold reserve against it, the explosion
would come in the long run. If the operation
was done on a very big scale the explosion would
come in the short run. The Commonwealth isn’t
asking for more notes just now, despite the large
amount that the banks are keeping off the market.

There’s money in handling oil. The Shell
Transport and Trading Co. last year gave
shareholders a bonus of 1,000,000 ordinary
£1 shares, then worth £6 on the market. The
capital of the co. was £10,000,000. Reserve
funds, mostly from premiums on the issues,
were £4.000,000, and the dividend 35 p.c.
per annum.

“No Importa”: Visited Kalgoorlie lately

Boulder tailings’ heap is bigger than the
Pyramid of Cheops, and is worth bracket-
ing as the Bth Wonder of the World. The
prospectors who pegged out the richest mile
of gold-bearing country in the world in 1894
were George Brookman, Chas. Pearce and
C. H. De Rose. Within three years the
market values of the properties pegged for
the Adelaide syndicate totalled 5J million
sterling. The Coolgardie Prospecting
Association, as it was called, had a capital
of £l50 —-subscribed by Messrs. Wigg, Hodge,
Doolett'e. Hamilton, Mcßride, W. Brook-
man, Colin Templeton, McEwin, Wilkinson,
Harrison and Geo. Brookman. Writer
bought one of the shares at £l5 and sold it
for £5O. Only one man stuck to his share
and received scrip in all the companies
floated off the syndicate’s leases. He got
perhaps half a million shares from first to
last.

YOUR automobile in one re-
spect is like any other piece of
machinery. It “settles down”
only after use. If well maintained,
it will run better the 2000th mile
than the first.
Motor trouble and undue noises
are too often caused by early neglect.
The metal worn off by friction is
gone for ever. And your lubri-
cating oil is your only protection
against this friction wear.
At all times, and especially dur-
ing the important “settling down”
period, when the moving parts
have not fully adjusted themselves
to each other, oil of the highest
lubricating efficiency is of the
utmost importance.
Each piston makes several thousand
strokes per mile.
The effects of the wrong oil will not be
noticed during the first piston stroke, or
the second. But when the piston strokes
run up into the millions and that does
not take long—friction begins to get its
due. You do not have to look for the
wear then. You hear it.
Realising the need of scientific help in
correct lubrication, careful motorists are
guided by the Vacuum Oil Company Pty.
Ltd.’s Chart of Automobile Recommenda-
tions (printed, in part, on right).
The oil specified insures high lubricating
efficiency through its correct body and
superior quality, and throughout the life of
the car insures a low operating cost per
mile.

About a Rebellion.
Bear Bulletin.—l came across a cry iu a
morning paper last week. Xicholls," mem-
ber of Parliament, was discoursing to the
Railway and Tramway Association at Bath-
urst (N.S.W.) in this fashion, unless the
daily organ belied him:—
All the assistance they could get would be by
applying to the Court for new conditions, and what
hope did they have of ever getting an increase in
wages?....The day was not far distant when the
working men and women of Australia would RISE
IN REBELLION against the tyrannical conditions
imposed upon them to-day by the Government and
the employers.... He thought a system would soon
come into existence that would give the working
class more of the wealth they produce.
Now about this rebellion and other things,
but principally the rebellion: —
Of course the talk about the hopelessness of the
employee getting a rise of wages in the Arbitration
Court is only the lying drivel to which lying
drivellers are addicted. In 1917 the Court decided
574 cases, and raised the wages of the applicants
by £81,007 per week, or £4,212,364 per annum.
And in 1916 the Court pushed up wages by
,£142,923 per week, or more than £7,400,000 per
annum. Certainly a few of these increases didn’t
produce much, for the industries perished, being
unable to pay more than the net value of the goods
produced, and production is very slow now for fear
of “speeding-up.” But the Court did its and
the w'ay it shoved up wages was heroic. It is a
dog’s trick to speak of the Court as a place that
gives the employee no hope, but then it must be
maddening to people like Nicholas to see wages
going up through an agency which isn’t Nicholls,
ana brings Nicholas no glory, and almost shows
the dashed superfluousness of Nicholls. However,
it is the rebellion that I want to speak about.
The demand that the working class should get
more of the wealth that it produces is commendable.
But as a set off—in the matters of railways, State-
owned tramways, railway construction and a vast
number of miscellaneous State enterprises‘ like Yanco
settlement,, it already gets more than it produces
after paying the interest bill; hence these affairs
show a deficit, and heavy taxes on the capitalistic
class and big loans follow. However, the rebellion is
the matter at issue.
Rebellions are ,a sort of habit. Whenever the
people have got absolute control of the Government,
with an equal vote for every adult, no property
qualification for members or electors, payment of
members so that the poorest man can be a member
or even a Prime Minister—in short, when the whole
people have the entire power and only need to use
ir as they, in their entire wisdom darned well please
some ambitious and deceiving hound wants to have
an insurrection and transfer the power to a mere
faction, with himself and his friends for leaders. So
he orders a crown and sceptre from the pi :.:ber and
prepares for action.
The question is, does Nicholls’s rebellion proposq
to disembowel infants and shoot young mothers with
their babies in their arms, and blow up hospitals,
and burn towns, and set people to forced labor, and
commit wholesale rape as well as mere robbery? Of
course it will get out of hand—all rebellions do
unless there is a much stronger boss-Bolshevik than
Nicholls is known to be in the lead—but how far
is this one likely to get out of hand? When the
fact that the Hun had been doing extra hideous
atrocities was mentioned the other day in the
Victorian Assembly, the matter was brushed aside
by Labor-leader Prendergast with the remark that
there are extremists in all parties. This is dis-
quieting. If the doings of a crowd which has filled
five countries with every kind of horror for four
years are merely the ebullitions of extremists such
as there are in all parties, isn’t it time that crowd
was searched for hidden weapons?
Certainly Nicholls and co. may be only Huckle-
berry Finns playing a game of pirates. Perhaps
when the crowd, learning from Nicholls that rebel-
lion is its only chance to escape from the dark
and snake-and-rat-haunted dungeon of tyranny, arises
in the kind of fury which is naturally caused by
the snake-and-rat-haunted cellar of oppression, and
the wildest and best-armed element gets to the front,
and that element in its haste cuts off the feet of
Labor-member McGirr for being a rich employer,
and scalps all the affluent high-salaried spokesmen
for wealth and undue interference, nobody will be
more surprised than these persons—or what is left
of them. I only mention this because the man who
sets a tumultuous movement moving has to move
much faster than he intended, in order to prevent
the movement overtaking him. He' is like the
hurried pedestrian who leads a stampede of cattle.
He has no voice in fixing the pace, and he only
leads so long as he can keep ahead of his followers..
Therefore I ask, simply because I take an interest
in rebellions, if Nicholls has a leader in view who
is guaranteed as competent to steer things after
the prisons are opened and the gun-shops and pubs
are looted, and the marriage tie has been violated
by men proposing to other men’s wives, and
Nicholls’s admirers are securing what they
think is, or ought to be, the product of their
labor, wherever they can find it, and a general
scuffle has set in? In short, has he got a faster
runner than Robespierre, for Maximilian didn’t
manage to keep ahead in the race? Yet his followers
hadn’t anything like as much cause for speed and fury
as Nicholls’s have, if some of the party manifestos
can be believed.
This is rather a discursive yarn, but then it
is a discursive subject.—Yours, etc., Henry
Horsecollar.
One explanation why some Japanese ship-
ping companies are earning now at the rate
of 200 to 700 per cent, per annum is that
recent freights from Japan to Australia have
climbed as high as £32 per ton. The Japan-
ese is the ship-landlord who collects the rent.
The Australian is the ship-tenant who pays
the rent, and pays, it in advance—that is,
before he gets the goods. In extreme cases
the Fair Rents Court of N. S. Wales allows
a net return of 91 per cent, per annum. That
means that the house-landlord may get 365.
or 375. per week for a bit of house accommo-
dation that cost £lOOO. In the extreme case
quoted above, the ship-landlord asks and
collects 26805. per week for a bit of ship
accommodation which cost £lOOO. Regarded
as a capitalist who puts up the cost of living
our local man is a mere bug alongside an
elephant. Also, the elephant is one great
cause of the bug: if it wasn’t for the freights
charged on building materials house rents
wouldn’t have gone up nearly so high. It is
the custom of the ardent reforme?, who is a
slow person and takes a long time to turn
round, to concentrate his wrath on the
house-lord because he has read in “Little
Dorrit,” the author of which died in 1870,
about how the Patriarch fleeced his tenants
in Bleeding Heart Yard, London. Possibly
some fictionist just born will wake him up to
the present situation about 1970.

FOR INDIGESTION TRY BISURATED
MAGNESIA.
IT’S SAFER THAN DRUGS
Many people just now are complaining of
indigestion, the most commonly met symp-
toms being a burning sensation in the pit
of the stomach, the belching of gas or wind,
acid saliva rising to the throat, flushed face
and heartburn. Contrary to general belief
these symptoms do not always indicate any
constitutional fault in or weakness of the
digestive apparatus. In fact, in nine cases
out of ten it will he found that the trouble
arises solely from an excessively acid con-
dition of the stomach and consequent fer-
mentation of the food contents. Medicines
and artificial digestives are not only unsuit-
able in such cases, but they may often do
positive harm, because they do not neutralise
the acid which is the root of the trouble.
For this purpose use a simple, harmless
antacid such as Bisurated Magnesia, which
is easily obtainable of any good chemist.
Readers who are troubled with any of the
symptoms named above should get a supply
of Bisurated Magnesia in powder or tablet
form and take half a teaspoonful of the
powder or two tablets in a little water after
meals. It will quickly neutralise the harm-
ful acid and prevent food fermentation, and
may probably also prove that the trouble
which appeared so serious was nothing more
than an accumulation of acid in the stomach
after all. Try it and see.— Advt.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, September 9, 1918.
My Dear Arini, —
The batch of returned invalids who had
the luck to get here on Wednesday in last
week had a sunny day for their landing.
As they motored up the steep hill from
Woollooipooloo towards Anzac Buffet, a
girls’ strongpost outside the Registrar-
General’s palatial offices let go a great rally.
Some kind of canned music churned out an
accompaniment, and the damsels waved
flags and sang gaily and strongly enough to
beat the westerly that uplifted Biljjim's hat
as he passed. Amongst the happy, bronzed and
smiling warriors (mostly with the smooth
cheeks of big schoolboys) were some veterans
of the war. Chaplain McAuliffe, C.8.E.,
the brave Sydney priest whose devotion for
four years to the sick and wounded in Egypt.
Gallipoli and France has been officially
recognised, was in the procession- On Fri-
day another batch got the same warm wel-
come, and needed it, for hurricanes of wind
and rain were the accompaniments , to their
disembarkation.
Home again after strenuous work at the
Front, which brought him the M.C., is Lieut.
F. Murchison Waugh.
The French Mission- is; the big event of
this week and gives a sparkle to the almost
stagnant social plane.
The laying of three keels at Walsh Island
by the State Ex., the Minister for Works and
the Acting-Minister for the Navy was the
occasion for a flow of oratory. Woman, accus-
tomed to turning the heel of a sock with swift
attacks on purl and plain, feels a cold chill
in her faith in man, however, at the date
of the proposed launching. It’s “about 12
months” ahead.
The Institute of Architects gave the glad-
hand to Professor Leslie Wilkinson in the
Royal Society’s Rooms the other afternoon.
The Society’s walls, by the way, illustrate,
incidentally, the bygone vogue of whiskers.
Hung with the portraits of men of mark in
science or the professions, with a few
pioneers as the Australian salt, these pic-
tures were in strange contrast to the clean-
shaven visitors who strolled in to see the new
arrival. Prof. Wilkinson might be a long,
lean Australian but for the rosier tint in an
English complexion which knows not, as yet,
the strength of Australian sunshine. Premier
Holman (his lady in royal blue was also
present) gave an amusing sketch of Art and
Architecture as it. is—and as it ought to
be. A timely hint that Australian houses
should be built to save the steps of the over-
worked housemother ivho will presently be
entirely without hired domestic help, was
taken in the best part by the guest of honor.
The new man. who speaks with the deliber-
ateness of a builder laying one’ brick upon
another, returned thanks for his welcome.
Mrs. Wilkinson and two youngsters will
follow father later on when the voyage from
England is less dangerous. Mrs. Pritchard
was acting hostess at the party.
Will Ashton’s French pictures illuminate
an end wall of the Royal Art Society show
and lifts the quality of this year’s above its
ordinary standard. The National Gallery
has bought his brilliant oil-painting Pont
Phillippe IV., Paris; also Alfred Coffey’s
pastels. .Toe Woliuski, home after six wan-
derings, has joined the Society’s council. He
returns with a wider art view and a virile
brush, a greatly-improved painter. He’s had
a picture hung on the Line in the Royal
Academy, and was amongst the carefuil.v-
hanged artists at a Noo York exhibition since
lie humped his easel around Canberra’s dusty
paddocks.
By-the-way. Will Ashton’s picture of the
Seine-and a bridge at Paris, just bought for
the Art Gallery of N. S. Wales, lias an
eventful history. It was hung first at the
Paris Salon, then exhibited in London, and
then torpedoed on its way back to Adelaide.
But the steamer did not sink, the picture
was landed, and on its next attempt it got
to Australia safely.
Y\ hile the wind performed like a howling
dervish and gusts of rain lashed the roof of
St. James’s Hall, a bright little show inside
went its way undisturbed, and the French-
Australian League gets a useful cheque.
Latecomers stepped softly—or not so softly
—to their seats while Frank Hutchens wei-
corned them with Chopin and Debussy; but
interest centred in the little French play, “Une
Place a la Cour,” in which Sydney girls tried
their luck with the French language. Some-
times their luck was out. Still, they looked
very nice. Notably blue-eyed Barbara
Bowker, with her nut-brown hair in long
curls of the period when the French Court
sunned itself in the smile of Marie Antoi-
nette. Stacks of flowers were showered on
the performers. Pretty Muffy Layton was
in the cast. A charming little group of chil-
dren (Nellie Joske and Rosamund McMillan
arranged the scene) gave a Breton folk-song
in character. The long brown trousers and
blue smocks of the boys, who were really
little girls, brought chortles of glee from their
friends in front.
Curiosity—perhaps—took one or two
strangers on a stormy afternoon to the fold
of the Housewives’ Association. The horti-
cultural Miss Brace gave an able little sketch
on intensive culture. “If you only plant some
tomatoes in the plot of spare ground which
nearly every suburban home possesses, you’re
doing something towards saving the huge
vegetable bill,” said the lady who admitted
that after gardening for 30 years she was
still learning. Then a well-groomed dame
addressed the company on the care of the
complexion and the art of achieving long and
silky locks. At this, Miss Brace, who wear,
her hair cut short like a man, fled into th
wet afternoon.
After the usual visit to James Burns’s
picturesque home, Gowan Brae- —the hi,
white house is set in grounds fringed with
the Spring glory of wattle, near Parra-
matta—-the Munro Fairgusoiis hurried back
to Melbourne.
Florence Rodway has finished a portrait
of PI. E. Ivater, M.L.G., which will be hung
in the Australian Club. The big red brick
building on a corner of Macquarie-street is
wont to hang its president on a wire in
the dining-room, and Henry Edward Kater
has joined the executed.
A dark-eyed charmer, Mamie Punch, of
the north side of the harbor, has been a
favorite singer at all kinds of patriotic
shows. The recently-returned Lieut-
Colonel Victor Conrick, who wears a D.S.O.
ribbon and the A. on his shoulder, is going
to keep the singer for himself. The wedding
is on September 12.
The 21st Machine Gun Company will get
some extra titbits when the profits of the
recent concert in St. James’s Hall are sol-
dered down in. tins. Mrs. Alex. Gordon, in
raven drapery, sang in French; baritone
Goossens assisted ; Ilenri Staell’s fiddle was
a popular feature in the programme ; Queenie
Fenton sang the heavy music of Goring
Thomas’s “My Heart is Weary”; Josie
Henderson, Una Dawson and Bindley Evans
opened the show with a musical trio. Bind-
ley has written a plaintive dirge, “Requiem,”
which tenor Philip Wilson sang with appro-
priate melanchoy. Dorothy Helmrich was
lion, organiser.
The great war has
turned the universe
topsy-turvy; but it
has set Woman
firmly on her feet.
Heroic nurses are not
a novelty, but the
official recognition of
their services is suffi-
ently new to cause a
ripple of excitement
when a Nightingale
is awarded the M.M.
That she should win
the same distinction
as a soldier is a
fresh page in her
story. Nurse Pearl
Corkhill, of N. S.
Wales, whose serene
face and firmly-
poised head is depicted in this photo by
Judith Fletcher (taken just before the brave
nurse left Sydney), has won the decoration.
While the enemy of mankind was enjoying
an orgy of bombing hospitals full of 'badly-
wounded men in France, this splendid Aus-
tralian was officially mentioned as “going
about her work amongst the wounded and
dying as calmly as though she were unaware
of any danger.” Yet the crash ,pf bursting
shells was just over her head and shrapnel
was falling round the beds of the helpless.
Some of the nurses, notably in the Canadian
unit, in the same locality were killed or
mortally wounded at their posts. The
N. S. Wales woman had the good
luck to come through safely. With
nerves of steel she moved serenely
round the ward, and the moral effect of this
amongst helpless patients was incalculable.
Our Nightingale is a daughter of the W. 11.
Corkhills, of Tilba Tilba. First detailed for
duty in Egypt, and afterwards at the Rouen
hospital, she is now close to the firing-line
in a casualty clearing-station.
Mrs. Braddon goes with her husband (he’s
on a trade commission on behalf of Aus-
tralia) to Uncle Sam’s country. So the
A.S.C. Comforts Fund workers gave the lady
—one of the best where there’s work to do for
Billiam at the Front —tea and waffles this
mid-week. The new maple-syrup cafe, run
by the Australian-’Murkan war-workers in
the old D.T. building, was the place of fare-
well. 1
Homes’ Day (September 13) is going
strong, like others of its kind, on raffles.
The Japanese in our midst are giving
liberally, and kims. of gorgeous flowered silk
will be laid on the altar of patriotism. The
Voluntary Workers’ headquarters’ address
is 19a Elizabeth-street, where the executive
is putting the last joint in the day’s scheme
of organisation. T. J. Ley, M.L.A., rolls
up his cuffs as hon. builder in charge of the
home that is to spring up like a mushroom in
Moore-street.
When the war-gong boomed Edward
Telford Simpson,
only son of E. P.
Simpson, of the legal
firm whose brass plate
reads Minter, Simp-
son and Co., was
with his father
in the profession.
The young man, now
F 1 i ght-Commander
Simpson, was
recently awarded the
Croix de Guerre
with palm, for con-
spicuous services in
peppering Fritz on
the Western Front.
This is his latest
photograph. He has
been on the wing for
two years.
Back in Sydney and at the top of his form
—the kind of form that would beg a ten-
pound note from a Shylock and get it before
the astute financier had time to collect his
wits—is J. J. Virgo, world secretary of the
Y.M.C.A. He made an impressive speech
at a Town Hall gathering last week to
show the value of the Association’s work
at the Front, and he had a stack of audited
figures to back his statements. Nearly
£200,000 worth of huts and provisions were
lost when the enemy surged forward, and
U.S. stood half of this loss by paying
£lOO,OOO. The American section has
provided something like ten million pounds
towards helping both the men in the trenches
and prisoners of war—-an almost incredible
sum. R. B. Orchard, M.H.R., added a
tribute, as chairman of the meeting.
On a gusty evening last week the red
strip of carpet which heralds a wedding
flapped on the old stone steps of St. James’s
Church. The pretty bride was Armide Hill,
of the pastoral family whose flocks are
white on the plains beyond Yass, who
floated into church on her father’s arm like
a soft white cloud of tulle. The ’groom,
Frederick W. Hume, belongs to the clan of
which explorer Hamilton Hume was a nota-
ble member. Marjorie Milson was chief
bridesmaiden.
The R. A. Society gave the Journalists’
Institute a chance of seeing its show by
electric-light on Saturday evening. Presi-
dent Lister Lister, who got the Wynne
Prize (about £33 in cash) this year, voiced
the welcome of the artists.
Prince Alfred Hospital had its annual
clearance of the year’s deeds, debts and
plans for the future this Monday afternoon.
His Ex. sat behind the chairman’s inkpot.
A new scheme for raising money, slightly
camouflaged as a P.A.H. Jubilee Fund, was
announced at the gathering. Prizes to
Nightingales were handed round before the
tea and bun rally.
For some weeks the Women’s Horticul-
tural Society has seethed with suppressed
excitement. The ins, and the outs, who
want to be in, will learn their fate on Satur-
day,- when the election of new officers for
the coming twelve months will be known.
When the name of the new president (Mrs.
Liddell retires from the job) and the face of
a new hon. sec. (if Miss Brace goes down
before the balloting) appear on the scene,
the mere peaceful man who opines that
women’s meetings are dull may get his out-
look corrected.
From Brisbane:—
Dr. Victor Conrick, D. 5.0., who is to marry
Mamie Punch, the Sydney singer, on September 12,
is in town for a few days looking- up old friends.
Dr. Conrick was in partnership with Dr. M. Cameron,
of South Brisbane, when he enlisted.
Mr. and Mrs. A. P. Greenfield gave a tea at the
Booroodabin green on Wednesday afternoon, in honor
of the N. S. Wales bowlers. The same night there
was gaiety at the Greenfield home, all the visiting
bowlers rolling along. Contralto Lena Hammond
and pianiste Gladys Frost sang and played.
Mrs. R. J. Black, of Sydney, is holidaying here.
The old girls of All Hallows gave a coin after-
noon on Saturday in aid> of the fading Patriotic
Fund, and raked in more than £250.
Great interest is being taken in Premier Ryan’s
suggested trip to England. Everyone is wondering
whether Mrs. Ryan will go too. Captain Pike, our
State recruiting-officer, says that she is the most
capable war-worker he knows.
The English mail recently brought a cheery letter
from Captain R. B. Mclntosh, M.C. In it he said,
“After 14 months my wound has healed, and I’m going
back next week to talk to Fritz.” That wound was
his fourth. In the very next casualty list published
after his letter arrived his name appeared again
among the wounded. He left as a sergeant in
the original loth Battalion.
Mrs. John Thorn, who died suddenly in Brisbane
last week, was the last of the elder generation of a
clan which included such well-known Bananalanders
as George Thorn, one-time State Premier; handsome
Mrs. George Harris, for years one of Brisbane’s best-
known hostesses; Mrs. Tom Rome, another good-
looker, whose son formed one of G.-G. Denman’s
staff; and Mrs. Donald Wallace, whose husband owned
the famous Mentor. Mrs. Cecil Stathem, wife of the
rector of All Saints’, is a daughter of the late
Mrs. Thorn; and one son, Captain Percy Thorn, a
crack revolver shot, is now using Fritz as a target.
Fernie Kent, of Fassifern, is another of Banana-
land’s old sporting brigade to go west. He was
one of the fathers of racing, and flourished in the
days when Ipswich was the Ascot of the North.
The budding singer sprouts freely in
Spring. In the crop is Vera Sullivan (a
pupil of Walter Thorman), who had Cyril
Monk and A. E. Y. Benham to musically
top-dress her appearance in the Conserva-
tcrium.
By way of showing that an amateur
patriotic society which plays musical
comedy (the cause is always the man at the
front) is not unmindful of the voice that
guides, the members handed Mrs. Kingsmill
Shaw, its lion, musical director, a handsome
clock'. Unlike so many presentation
chronometers, this one keeps the right time.
The Western Women War Workers’ Asso-
ciation’s annual report has come along. The
president is Mrs. Leeds. Mr. James Mackay
is lion, treas., and the lion, sec., Mrs. W.
Yeung, looks after the correspondence. The
Association’s activities were in the Outback,
where occasionally neighbors may be separ-
ated by 10, 50 or 100 miles. Didn’t George
Essex Evans tell us what the women of the
West could do? And that was long before
the drums began to beat. So Sydney is not
surprised to get the news that they’re doing
amazing things in war-time.
J. and N. Tait’s slim young business-
manager, E. J. Gravestock, has been seriously
ill in a private hospital. He seems to have
turned the corner after an operation.
Dr. Heber Green, of the Commonwealth
Institute of Science, was recently in Syd-
ney for a few days. The big Australian, a
Melbourne graduate, by the way, is learned
in chemistry, and he’s applying its best tricks
in order to cope with the tin-plate shortage.
Cardboard is going to be so doctored that
never a dewdrop will percolate through.
The French Mission will have lightning-
sketch impressions of the State fishery’s
marble, slabs, the promulgation of the three
It’s in State schools, the interior of Govern-
ment House, the haze on the sides of a Blue
Mountain gully, of the Lord Mayor in his
best official frock, and of goodness knows how
many politicians well scrubbed for the occa-
sion, before they escape from N. S. Wales.
They will also peer into the Lithgow iron-
works, and at the column to the memory of
their distinguished countryman La Perouse,
at Botany.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

The Duo-Concerto positively controls tone
color, and the fadl of the latest rolls being
hand recorded emphasises the importance of
being able to control every shade of tone
instantly. The inventor of this wonderful
instrument recognised this, and after years of
exhaustive tests at last succeeded in producing
an instrument that really does give a faithful
reproduction of the artist’s actual playing.
Added to this there is a transposing' device
which enables you to play song- accompani-
ments in any key to suit the voice, also a
non-friction motor that does not require any
lubrication and is so easy to pedal that a
little child can play for hours without the

WHEN “OUT OF SORTS” TAKE
CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
If fretful, feverish, constipated, bilious
or tongue coated, take this delicious
fruit laxative at once.
The vague, general discomfort of being
“out of sorts,” when the stomach turns
against food, the eye is dull and the tongue
coated and heavy, can be banished in a few
hours by a dose of California Syrup of Figs
—“Califig.” There is no need to put up
with these things until to-morrow, waiting
for bedtime to take medicine. California
Syrup of Figs—“Califig”—will begin to do
you good the moment you take it—at any
hour —and cause no discomfort. This plea-
sant-tasting, refreshing fruit laxative
cleanses the stomach, gently sweeps away all
accumulations of undigested food, and stimu-
lates the liver to assist in relieving the
bowels. By evening the tongue will be clear
again and the overflow of bile swept away;
you will be yourself again, with a good appe-
tite and digestion. This is the medicine
which does such wonders for children of all
ages ; but it is every bit as good for grown-
up people, and there are full directions for
every age with the bottle. Take care to buy
the genuine, as there are imitations on the
market. Ask for “Califig”—California
Syrup of Figs, and look for the name and
trade mark of the California Fig Syrup Co.
AIJ chemists sell “Califig”—California Syrup
of Figs—in bottles of two sizes, 1/1§ and
1/9. [2

My Dear Yarrie, —
Major William Johnston, M.G., a doctor
son of lately-dead Judge Johnston, has added
the D.S.O. to his other war-honor. He won
the new decoration while attending to casual-
ties during enemy-shelling prior to an Aus-
tralian attack and for toiling on in the thick
of a Hun barrage for several hours after the
attack had begun. They winged him in the
end, but he survives to wear the extra ribbon.
At present furloughing in Melbourne, Cap-
tain Harry Rigby, M.C., of the British Air
Service, the school-chum of the late Geoff
Wall, author of “Songs of an Airman,” who
took him for his first fly. Rigby came
via America to meet his father, E. J. Rigby,
the mining-engineering man who has been
retained in the U.S. to superintend shipbuild-
ing. Still in his minority, young Rigby
learned to fly as a civilian, and has been in
France since 1916. He got his M.C. for
conspicuous work over the Arras-Baupaume-
road this year.
Lieut. Darcy Power, whose dad is second
in command at the Mint, has been seriously
wounded in the shoulder during his third
year with the A.I.F. He was one of the
1914 G rammar crew.
A willing Anzac went west when Capt.
Brian O’Sullivan died of wounds during the
recent big lighting in France. When the war
began O’Sullivan was a medical student at
Melbourne University. He left for Egypt
in 1914 and fought in the desert and on
Gallipoli, presently going on to France,
where he took a hand in the second battle of
the Somme. In March of last year he came
home to continue his medical course, but
found the claims of his pals in France too
strong to be resisted. He went back iu
January and helped with the trench-mortars
until the end. Dad is Dr. E. F. O’Sullivan,
who used to practise at Castlemaine, but
nowadays belongs to the hard-worked group
of doctors who practise on Richmond Hill.
The 6th Infantry Brigade Comforts Depot
is circulating 500 cards inviting gifts of £1
in 20 weekly instalments, to provide their
particular BTlljims with some pudding and a

happiness for half-a-dozen deserving heroes
by dropping it into the Depot box at
Flinders Buildings.
Lieutenant Arthur Le Patourel has casu-
ally brought himself into Melbourne from
Mesopotamia, where he has been seeing active
service with the 13th Hussars. Arthur is
a well-known figure wherever horses are to
be found, so Kirk’s Bazaar and the New-
market Horse Yards know him well. He is
a kinsman o'f pretty Vera -Le Patourel who
used to decorate local functions.
Recently at Black Rock, near Melbourne,
Mrs. Anna Somer died. She was born near
Campbelltown (N.S.W.) 82 years ago. In
the early ’4o’s her father, Patrick Hennessey,
made a great trek with horses and cattle and
household goods on drays to take up Wope-
rana station on the Murray, near Tocumwal.
From there, when she was 17, Anna
Hennessey married John Somer, and went to
live for a time at Lake Victoria. Of her
nine children five survive her. among them
being 11. M. Somer. Secretary of N. S. Wales
Royal Agricultural Society. War-correspon-
dent Harry Gullett is a grandson. Robert
Brown, who founded Collindina station, was
her uncle, and two of her aunts married two
of the Huon family. When Robert Brown
came to Australia lie brought with him his
father and mother, and settled them in a
home on the estate.
Archbishop Mannix is the latest influenza
victim. When last heard of he was shut
indoors with the demon that defies bell, book

Women Leagueites, headed by Mrs. Deakin

The proceeds of the Daffodil Show last
week in the Town Hall go to the Chil-
dren’s Hospital. The Gaud Mayor opened
the exhibition of blooms, which had just
escaped damage from the heavy rains. Gover-
nor Stanley took his whole suite to the show
on Thursday ; Lady Stanley and Melba made
a later visit. Some non-competitive blooms
came from the V.R.C. gardens, from the
Werribee Chirnsides’ gorgeous place, from
Mrs. Moore, of Toorak, and from Mr. G. W.
Robinson. ,T. S. Oliver sent a ton or so of
cut flowers from his garden to be sold for
hospital funds. A fine orchestra was an
added pleasure.
Golf-champion Bruce, on liis way to the
war, stepped off’ the boat at Durban and
swung his clubs in a big tournament there.
He was somewhat out of form after several
golfless months; but managed to win, and
carried a trophy back to his transport.
Fiance Betty Paterson is conveying the glad
news around Melbourne.
Flight-Lieutenant Tom L. Baillieu, of the
A.F.C., lately flew
into the air and
brought down a Dis-
tinguished Flying
Cross. The cable to
his p/oud father,
William Baillieu,
M.L.C., doesn’t say
anything about a
preliminary shower
of .obliterated
flying Huns coming
to earth; but that’s
usually what these

handed out for.
The new D.F.C. is
an old boy of Melb.

The Union Club, Sydney, is about to
acquire a new secretary, in the person of
William Tainsh, who for some years has
filled a similar position at the Melbourne
Savage Club. In addition to his business
and social qualifications, Tainsh is a vocal-
ist who has had professional experience.
Also he is the husband of photographer Mina
Moore.
Dr. John Smyth, for many years the prin-
cipal of the Teachers’ Training College,
Carlton, has been appointed Professor of
Education —the new chair at Melbourne Uni-
versity. The appointment is for five years.
He is particularly well adapted for such a
position, as the various classes of teachers
for different grades of schools have all come
under his administration. He will continue
to act in his old capacity.
Old Dr. Sam Thornton, first Protestant
Bishop of Ballarat, left £8382 behind him,
and in the absence of published details of the
will, it may be reasonably assumed that
most of it will be handled by the lady he
married when he was 80. In his early years
he was a curate and an evangelist in the East
End of London, and his fiery, impetuous zeal
led him to start open-air preaching in the
populous Mile End-road. He gathered
crowds, and was twice arrested for obstruct-
ing the thoroughfare. His old Melbourne
episcopal chum, Dr. Moorliouse, Bishop of
Manchester, gave him the lucrative rectory
of Blackburn, and made him an assistant
prelate of Manchester diocese.
The Monash dame is thinking of Sydney
just now. She hopes to get over there before

Adelaide notes
The Red Cross Society has launched its September
appeal with a dash that should send its bank balance
soaring- upwards. The show of the week was the
Gala Performance at the theatre, on Tuesday, at
which Lady Galway started the Red Cross Badge
Drive with a moving appeal. Bids ranging from £1
upwards brought in £2750 for the badges. The
Red Cross flag presented by A. J. Roberts went to
Mrs. T. R. Scarfe at 200 guineas. A repetition of
the Red Cross tea-room girl’s revue filled the second
half of the programme; the star items on the first
half were the Peacock Ballet, arranged by Miss E.
Hcneywill and Frank Williams, and a second ballet.
The Call of France, in which Mr. Williams had
Kathleen Lawrence as his collaborator. For the
Peacock Ballet the decoi-ative scenery was the best
ot the many good things Frank Williams has done,
and the dressing was excellent.
Further cash was raised for the fund by a concert
arranged by the pupils of Mrs. Kugelberg, in the
Queen’s Hall, on Monday evening, and a Bach Society
concert in the Town Hall two nights later. At the
latter show the first of the £lO bonds entitling
holders to a ride in the’ war tank were sold. The
Governor was the first purchaser. The Red Cross
Stock Drive was begun at Wednesday’s market, when
250 sheep from the Mutooroo Pastoral Co. were sold.
Last Friday’s Button Day brought 15 in £ll4O for
the Wattle Day League’s Orthopedic Wing at Keswick
Military Hospital, and country returns are still to
come. Australia Day takings have already topped
the £60,000 mark, and money is still arriving.
Lieut. Collier Cudmore has rejoined his old regi-
ment in France, after a long convalescence necessi-
tated by severe wounds received in the 1916 offensive.
The State's division of the Australian Comforts
Fund has nailed down most of its 17,000 boxes for
the men at the Front. The same body has now
launched ah appeal for the sailors’ Christmas, and
there should be no doubt about the response to that.
The will of the late Capt. G. A. Harvey has been
lodged for probate, and the estate, which goes to his
widow, was sworn at just on £BO,OOO. He was
with the R.A.M.C. from the early days of the war.
News has come from England of the death of Mrs.
R. K. Boothby, a sister of Mrs. Allan McFarlano.
Local artists are congratulating Will Ashton on
the fact that the N. S. Wales Gallery has just pur-
chased a third picture from him. The canvas in
question, “Pont Phillippe 1V.,” was hung on the line
iu the Paris Salon and also at the recent exhibition
of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters of London.
Mrs. E. W. Van Senden and. her sister, Miss
Richardson, have gladdened the hearts of local
Anglican clergy by presenting them with a furnished
house on the sea-wall at Brighton. The idea is that
it will provide a holiday house for them and their
families, especially for bush parsons.
Extraordinary results have been achieved by the
Children’s Patriotic Fund. The net takings stand
at nearly £46,000 —£32,000 of which came in
during the financial year that ended on June 30.
Two of S.A.’s best-known far-north stations have
changed hands after long holding by their late
owners. Lachlan McTaggart has sold Wooltana to

Adelaide, from Hogarth and Warren, It consists of
6000 square miles of country on the west side of
Lake Eyre, 600 miles north from Adelaide. It was
first taken up by Hugh Glass, a Victorian, in 1860,
but has for over half a century been held by the
Hogarth and Warren families.
Marjorie Eadie, daughter of Dr. Eadie, is
engaged to editor Evan Pearse, of the Pas-
toralists Review, son of Captain Pearse,
of Sydney, owner of the paper. Marjorie is
a writer herself, and The Bulletin has
published some of her poems, including
“Mothers o’ Men.” She is a brilliant girl
with a voice and a weakness for amateur
theatricals. Her solitaire diamond engage-
ment ring is said to have cost a couple of
hundred pounds. They are planning the
wedding for December with a honeymoon to
Kosciusko, this last with the permission of
the doctor. The bride-to-be has been very
ill, and is only just convalescent.
Widower Dr. Eadie is consoling himself
for the prospective loss of his daughter by
getting engaged himself. He Is to be married
in January to Jess Heron, a daughter of
banking man Heron.
Corrie Fulford and Hugh Rose are to be
married at the end of this month, after
which they will go to live at Murrumbeena.
The ’groom-elect, who has a pleasing bari-
tone, earned amateur theatrical applause in

Cahill has a fierce
intensity for work and detail. He is about
sft. nothing and hurries around under a
Samson-like mop of ginger curly hair while
humor twinkles out of his very blue eyes.
Mrs. Maud Rigby, widow of Dr. Ernest
Rigby, of Perth, W.A., ventured again into
matrimony the other day on the arm of
young George Patterson, a smart adver-
tising specialist well known in Inky circles
in Sydney and Melbourne. Patterson, who
is a grandson of old actor George Rogers, is
not long back from the Front, where he
served two and a half years, while his wife
did her share in hospitals in Egypt, India
and England.
Mr. and Mrs. Terence Newell (three weeks
ago the bride answered to the name of Beryl
Fanning) are in town after their Coombe

presently to join the Piddington household
once more.
Melba lately presented the G.-G. with a
gramophone and every record that has ev» r
been made of her voice.
Private George Cowley, the Melbourne
baritone, spends his rare spells of leave in
England singing songs to wounded soldiers.
Lately he dropped in at Lady Neville’s hos-
pital at Brighton and carolled some French

A great house turned up for another help-
ing of Chappell concert at the Town Hall 011
Saturday. Leila Doubleday was among the
front row of notables, and in the organ
gallery choirmaster J. J. Bailey bunched a
chorus of three or four dozen who concealed
some of the vacancy in that mournful region.
The feminine section of the choir was unani-
mous in white, but soon put up a barrage of
wraps against the attacks of bronchitis
draughts that crept down through the chinks
in the organ at the back. All the color was
on Elsy Treweek, Lilian Gibson and Mar-
gery Gray. Elsy’s dark Latin comeliness
robbed her puce trimmings of some of their
emphasis and effect, but all the same she
looked very well. The Junoesque Miss Gib-
son, in buttercup silk, gave the impression
of a fancy-dress impersonation of a scram-
bled egg. Miss Gray was more subdued in
a steely lace creation, with a broad helping
of salmon pink.
Gone out to meningitis in a London hos-
pital, Vasco Louriero, a lightning portraitist
and caricaturist, formerly of Melbourne, wlm
travelled the world on his pencil and sketch-
book. Vasco made a comfortable living
from his pencillings, in addition to paying
first-class exes, everywhere. When the big
trouble came along, Vasco simply had to be
in it, and said farewell to a wife in Too-
woomba (Q.) when the 11th Field Engineers
left. In June last an injury to his spine put
him in the casualty-lists, and he was well on
his way to recovery when meningitis claimed
him.
Bertha Merfield has glorified the sombre
surroundings of the Upper Ilall Athemeum

Ithoda Wager, who sets precious stones so
effectively, and whose hand-made jewellery
is a feature at every Arts and Grafts exhi-

was bought the day before the local show
was opened. Miss Wager is from Scotland,
with a brother in Fiji, where she spent the
first two of her years in southern waters.
If you’re thinking of sending a Christmas
parcel to a soldier or sailor, forget the im-
ported article for a while and send some
Australian dried fruit. Letters just in speak
of the jubilation caused by the arrival of
such a packet. Send only the best, however,
for if there are worms in them the wrigglers
will multiply exceedingly, and there’s no
sense in sending worms to hungry soldiers.
Eva Webber, a young Bananaland girl
who discovered she had a voice, had an

The Glaciarium finished its gliding season
on Saturday with a soldiers’ night. Carni-

The racing at Caulfield last Saturday
must have been rather disheartening to backers of
Coq D’Or for Melbourne Cup. It wasn’t that the
English nag got beaten after making a winning
show in the nine furlongs Heatheriie Handicap, but
that he bore out so far that three of them beat
him. The Coq had done it on the track, and lie
did it again on the pinch. Ethiopian, on the other
hand, made a respectable finishing effort and nearly
caught Daius on the post, but to be practically as
good as Daius at a 151 b. disadvantage doesn’t make'
Ethiopian out to be a smasher.
King Offa justified the odds-on for the Doona Trial
bv making hacks of 17 opponents in the run home.
In King Offa’s case it was the bad get-away that
looked unpromising for his Gup chance. A slow
beginner has a lot to contend with in a Caulfield
(kip, and the imported son of Radium will have to
prove himself at the barrier before he will look a
very promising thing for Caulfield. In the meantime
it is evident that Dick Bradfield has hardly over-
estimated the animal’s speed and gameness.
The Memsie Stakes, which has often been a guide
to future “form,” seemed to put Tragic Star out
of the competition for Derby honors, though there
is still some flesh to come off the burly form of that
handsome three-year-old. The black had the foot of
a flier for a mile, but was beaten out of a place in
the last furlong by Eusebius, Dunwil and Private
King. The fact that Outlook was also unplaced
merely suggests that he still lacks condition, whilst
the carelessness of King’s Treasure in breaking
another blood-vessel practically counts him out of
consideration for the present. A previous breakage
was said to be due to the colt fighting for his head.
In this instance the excuse wasn’t offered.
After first acceptances 52 are left in the
Epsom and 64 in the Metropolitan. There are more
to disappear yet, but it looks fairly certain that the
barrier will be quite full enough for each race.
Wolaroi has dropped out of the mile, but remains
in the longer journey. King Offa is among the miss-
ing. Included in the acceptances for both events
is an imported stranger, The Destroyer This nag
was backed fairly well last week for both events, and
that is just about all that is known of him, apart
from rumor, which alleges the certainty of more
being known later on.
* * * *
There was one race with a certain element
of interest in it at Moorefield (Sydney) on Saturday.
This was the Flying, in which the running may or
may not throw some light on the Epsom. Among
the starters were Wolaroi, Dame Acre, Bimeter, For-
trait and Volpi. The race was run in divisions.
In the first the even-moncy-chance Volpi, for a time
favorite for the Epsom, was walloped again by
Portrait, who was giving him a stone, in the second,
Dame Acre was a length too good for Wolaroi.
Dimeter, a good warm favorite to start with, was
half a dozen lengths astern, a circumstance which
-ought to nearly sicken the crowd who have rushed
this once good horse in recent starts. Dame Acre’s
win with 9st. (21b. more than her Epsom weight)
had a lot of merit about it. If she doesn’t start
favorite for the Epsom there will have to be a
mighty lot of money for something else. Wolaroi
was far from being disgraced. He had only had
about one really fast gallop for a long time, and if
he keeps in repair will be a much-improved horse in
another week or two. Bimeter’s performances in
public are strangely at variance with his track
work. The explanation is not easy unless it is that
he is turning sour. His Rosehill and Moorefield
efforts suggest that, anyway.

Behold again the tote on the 60, 20, 20
method —at Moorefield (Sydney) on Saturday. Apart
from divs, on winners 16 divs. were paid on other
placed horses, in six cases the punter got back less
than he put in ; in five other instances he laid odds of
20 to 1 “on,” 10 to 1 “on,” and 7 to 5 “on” ; twice
he laid even-money, once got 9 to 5 and once annexed
the once-in-blue-moon chance of 52 to 1. In one
race a punter holding £1 on each of the lliree
placed horses would have won £1 13s. on the lot;
in another he would have won 19s. Thus, by buying
£6 worth of tickets and performing the miracle of
collecting six successive dividends, he would have
won £2 12s. ; that is, he would have laid odds of
more than 2 to 1 “on” himself, doing an almost
incredible thing. There were eight races in which if
the punter had secured a ticket on each of the place-
getters (other than first) on which a dividend was
paid, he would 'by a risk of £6 have won £2 Is.
This paper once again asks Chief Secretary George
Fuller to take his 'month’s wages out to a suburban
course for a few Saturdays, and, after backing his
fancies for places at this rate, explain how long the
funds lasted.

Day, riding A. E. Bowman’s Culluleraine
in the Grand National Steeple of Adelaide Racing
Club, must have been glad to get home. After the
better-fancied Hobgoblin had fallen, the winner gave
the last fence a mighty clout, and only good riding
steadied him. He arrived just a head in front of
Lord’s Hawkwing. The afternoon was remarkable for
good dividends in the Mayor’s Mile —£27 13s. for
the winner and £9 11s. for the second. Also for a
great five furlongs by Pistolarie. With lOst. 121 b.
he was giving' a stone and a half to everything—2l
to the second horse. Yet he was made favorite, and
won comfortably. The fields were so big that two
events had to be divided, making nine races in all
for the day. On the two-day meeting the totalisator
handled £43,500, which is £lO,OOO more than in
any recent year, and very close to the record of 1911.
On . the second day of the meeting a totalisator clerk
mixed a tray of £5 tickets with £1 vouchers, and
the contents were passed out accordingly. The mis-
take was soon discovered, but not until 23 £5 tickets
on Antos (the winner) had been sold at a discount of
80 per cent, apiece. Notices were posted, and 20 of
the 23 were presented by conscientious bettors as £1
tickets. Three individuals, however, kept mum and
collected in full. The percentage was not bad, but
through the three side-steppers a great chance was
missed for cackling over the integrity of Adelaide
punters.

“Slow” : Someone has remarked about 7904
times that it is the frequency of the unexpected hap-
pening which gives to racing its peculiar zest or flavor
or whatever it is the u.h. tastes like. Personally I
dunno anything about that, having been too much
occupied in noticing the frequency with which racing
gives the average punter the pip. But a meeting up at
Maitland (N.S.W.) the other day must have been
tremendously enjoyable to the sports who derive
entertainment from the u.h. One nag which had
started 37 times last year, and won a single minor
event, turned up a winner. Another that had been
winning as easily as kiss-your-haml all round the
countryside turned up a loser. And a string of mokes
from Sydney was unexpectedly snuffed out. on every
occasion. There was so much zest about it all that
everybody but MacShortodds arrived home looking as
if they were taking lessons in German.
*<* * *
“Trot”: Sydney Referee had a long and
very interesting article the other day about certain
aspects of 2-year-old racing. The point of it all was
that as practically all the Australian nags which
turned out to be the best performers had been raced
at two years, that as the Melbourne Cup had almost
invariably been won by a nag raced as a juvenile,
and that as in nearly every instance the first-class
2-year-old became a champion at 3 and 4 years, the
people who snort at 2-year-old racing had not proved
their case. It was quite a good yarn, compiled with
painstaking care; but I beg to draw the Referee's
attention to the circumstance that while the facts
may be as stated, the arguments built thereon and
the conclusions _ derived therefrom are afflicted with
springhalt. It is simply no use in a country where
2-year-racing is the fashion, where 99 per cent, of
the horses are put thus early to business, to say, “All
the good 3- and 4-year-olds ran at two years, there-
fore 2-year-old racing did no harm. - ’ Short cuts in
controversy of that kind are reminiscent of the poli-
tician who was accustomed to explain that scores of
his dearest friends went to work when they were aged
nine or ten. and having lived to a ripe old age had
exploded the gag about child-labor in mines and
factories being harmful. The question is not whether
a small percentage of horses having survived the
gruelling of the training-stable and racecourse at
two years subsequently won or failed to win certain
races. It is whether racing at this age, viewed in its
broadest aspect (taking notice of the ruins and
assassinations as well as the survivors) is a good
thing for the thoroughbred horse. The answer cannot
possibly consist of a recital of what horses raced at
two years old did afterwards. That argument cduld
only be legitimately used if over a period of years
these horses' had been matched against horses in
equal number and of similar class or stamina that
had not been raced when in the immature stage.
And even then the undue wastage of horse in the
stables, and particularly the calamitous effect of
early racing on fillies, would be a strong clement in
the discussion.
It proves nothing to say that Westcourt
raced at two vears old, or to recite the
doings at that age of Desert Gold, and ask where
“held over” animals are to be seen of equal calibre.
These are exceptional horses and, in anv case, two-
year-old galloping did Westcourt such a‘ lot of good
that he was beaten every time he started at three
years. The same could be said of Poitrina, whose
record is suggestive of early racing having been a
mistake, except so far as cash went. Wolaroi was a.
smasher at two. years. For a great part of his third
yen r he was very much off, though he recovered and
did brilliant things, only to go into a long retire-
ment, Thrice was a smasher, too, in his early days,
but hasn t done anything big since j and so the yarn
might go on, getting nowhere in particular at’ the
finish. But when speaking of the horses that have
won after being used a lot when young, it may be
worth taking notice that of the present favorites
for the Melbourne and' Caulfield Cups one, Coq d’Or,
was Very gently treated at two, and King
Offa was not used at all. Rebus, winner of last
Sydney Cup, was not started at two, nor was the
runner-up, Shadowland. The Fortune Hunter,
winner of the previous Sydney Cup, was very kindly
treated at two; so, also, was the winner of the Cup
of 1915, Scotch Artillery, whose win was a fluke, no
doubt; but still was a win. Harriet Graham, winner
of the Australian Cup and runner-up to the Fortune
.Hunter, at Sydney, was not started at two. Amata
was a very brilliant sprinter. She was not started at
two. Nor was Arch Marella, one of the smartest
middle-distance handicappers seen at Rand wick last
season. Poitrel, a double winner at Randwick in
the summer, was not seriously raced at two. Patrobas
was treated very carefully. So was Chantemerle.
Baltic Sea won the rich Breeders’ Plate at Randwick,
and all the races he has done since reaching more
mature years cannot be mentioned, because they
didn’t happen. The evidence about the real point is
a long way from being all on the side of the early-
to-work brigade. Such limited direct evidence as is
available because of the mania of these people is
more than suggestive that if reasonable chances
existed for producing it they wouldn’t have a leg
to stand on. Nearly every intelligent horsemaster
knows that, except in the case of a very few pre-
cocious animals, this is so—that racing before the
autumn is wrong, that even then it ought to be
limited, and that it would be infinitely better for
the Australian horse if there were none of it.

There are easier jobs than being sti-
pendiary steward at N. S. Wales Outback meetings.
Harry Hogan, of the Western District Racing Associa-

motor to keep up with the racing business. Hogan
was on the hustle for 287 days.

There was one racing man less in Maori-
land last week when Jack Pollock passed out. He
was 65, and for a great many years had been con-
nected one way and another with the turf and the
running track. As a young man he was a well-
known athlete. Later, he ran a few horses. Subse-
quentlv he became handieapper to the Wellington
Racing Club and other institutions. For several
years he had been president of the Amateur Athletic
Association, a concern in which his interest never
flagged. # # 4
“Carfax": Only one or two names among
the 79 young : uns remaining in the A..T.C. Breeders’
Plate and Gimcrack Stakes catch the eye as being
aptly chosen. “Quiekstick” for the Ally by Feather-
stick —Fleet Street is good. “Cheekspear” for a geld-
ing by Breakspear —Tlie Pledge is ditto ; but botli are
coined words, and because of that “Snow Star” for
a White Star —Snowy River colt looks and sounds
better. Apart from these three the names bestowed
upon tlie youngsters range from the careless to the
banal. The heaviness and infertility of the people
who choose names for Australian horses is amazing.
Tlie passion for minting new words out of the names
of a moke’s parents seems to be an obsession, and
some of the results in this list are frightful. One
man confronted with tlie job of christening a nag
by Wolowa —Blacking was satisfied wifli “Welshine”
—a word which, in addition to being ugly, is
meaningless. The Rajah lias lighted on “Kilbreeze”
for a Kilbronev —Briselette, and thereby merely adds
another to the many atrocities perpetrated because
of Kilbronev. As mere mention of that sire seems
to incite owners to kill something, this page hope-
fully waits to hear of nags called “lvilhun” and
“Kilrabbits.” Old King Cole gets out of trouble by
sticking to Princes and Princesses and Duchesses.
Among the new crop is a “Duchess Susan” and a
“Princess Susan.” This leaves the way open for
Empress Susan, Dowager Empress Susan, Princess
Susan’s Aunty, Duchess Susan s. Lincle—-and so on,
for ever. The bright, imaginative fancy of Old King
Cole plays through the stud-book like a double-
furrowed plough.

Tattersall’s, lias had bad luck with his two-year-old
Red Olay, the first of the stock of Tostiguous to race.
It fell without any apparent reason in a Juvenile
Handicap, and was found to have snapped both
forelegs. A bullet was, of course, the only remedy.
Tlie same day saw two remarkable resurrections, a
race being won by Maorilander (Hierarch —Te Huinga)
eight years old, and without a win for the last three ;
and another by that very old stager, the neatly-
named Epistle (Pistol —Poetess).

On sloppy ground, on September 5, at tlie
61st Alburv Show, Mrs. A. Judd’s 14.1 pony Thumbs
Up (ridden by the Queensland abo. Roley Doctor)
and W. .J. Weir’s Peter broke the Australian high-
jump record of 7ft. 3fin. . (made by Mrs. Judd’s
Bandolier, at Quirindi, in 1915) by 1-Jin. —each at
tlie third time of asking. Someone threw mud on
the performance, but this was cleared away by an
architect, a surveyor and an engineer. Their instru-
ments and statutory declaration showed 7ft. 5.2 in.
It was a really wonderful performance under such
conditions, particularly on the part of the pony.
If the ground had been in good order the nags might
have cleared the national debt. The world’s record,
Bft. 2in., is held by the Yankee horse Heatlierbloom ;
but is it a record, seeing that the horse was assisted
by a turf spring-board, whatever that, is ?

The N. S. Wales Metropolitan Coursing
Club ran the season down with a two-days’ meeting
at Fifefield, Liverpool, last week-end. The principal
event was the 'September Stakes for 32 all-aged
maidens, the Club guaranteeing the prize money
in event of tlie stake not filling-. This brought a
full entry. Tlie winner, Cubberoo, is a White Hope
(imp.)—Windora puppy, so little thought of at the
first calling of' the card that 50 to l was offered
about him. The runner-up was Fanny's Wonder, hv
Wheatley Wonder (imp.)—Fanny Brown. The favorite,
Bally Owen, was well named, He went out first pop.

The iriter-State Test Stake, run at Corowa
last week, attracted a smart lot of tykes. The winner
turned up in AV'hite Verse, a bitch by White Hope
(imp.)—Miss Verse. The runner-up, Shy Mary, is
also a White Hope. Press Me, the Victorian
Waterloo Cup winner, and Achieved, the N. S. Wales
Waterloo Cup winner, were amongst the also rans.
White Verse won the Stake last year.

The trip of the South Sydney hoofballers
to Bananaland last week was something in the way
of _ a cakewalk. The Ma State League champions
defeated Merthyr (29 —19) for the inter-State club
premiership, routed Maryborough (19 —8), and on
Saturday waltzed off the field with a draw (19
points each) against the Northern rep. team.
* * * *
The final match of Vic. League football
on Saturday was almost up to pre-war standard—
Strenuous play, exciting finish, crowded “gallery”
and “pit' ; but empty “circle.” South had been
beaten once only during the season—by St. Kilda —
and played a strong game; but ’Wood's system kept
it a trifle to the good until nearing the end, when
the Red-and-Whites pulled up level." Then the Mag-
pies scored a point. The Southerners made a last
rush and landed the ball right in front, where two
Magpie backs mulled tlie mark between them and
a. smart South forward booted it through, giving his
side a 5-point lead, as the bell rang—62 to ’Wood’s
57. This is South’s second premiership since the
League started business. Saturday’s audience num-
bered 39,168, as compared with 54,846 in ’l3.
Totals for the three deciding games aggregate
104,214, and the takings amounted to £2916 19s. 3d.,
all of which except out-of-pocket exes, has been pro-
mised to war funds.

Melbourne’s younger hoofballers still excel
at the game of win, tie or wrangle. The Junior Ass.
has for some weeks been investigating the occurrences
at a Collingwood-Preston match, and at latest had
accepted the view of the offending club, Preston, that
the “alleged assault on the umpire had been greatly
exaggerated, as he had merely been hooted by excited
partisans and a brick had been thrown at him, which
hit him.” It was an expensive brick, anvhow as
the Court subsequently invited two of the “partisans”
to pay £8 into the revenue. This particular umpire
seems to be unpopular, inasmuch as at the f’ort-
Yarraville match he had “several boots thrown at
him, which, he considered, was over the odds.” it
was, with footwear at its present price it amounted
to disgraceful waste when blue-metal and fence-
pickets were handy. But he gets a lot of excitement
for his half-guinea fee.

The Lindrumi brothers’ struggle for the
Australian billiard championship at Sydney was the
lamest affair of the sort the public has paid to look
upon for a long while. It was shorn of interest by
many considerations, one being that as recognised
standard conditions were not called for, whatever
happened would find no place on the record slate.
In the first: week the brothers put a little fizz into
the play, Walter leading by 8917 to Fred’s 7100;
but the remainder of the match labored so heavily
that both players were far behind points at full-
time. The game closed as “a draw” —Walter 16,750,
Fred 16,741. In three-figure breaks Walter reeled
off 56 to Fred’s 52, and also made the biggest sticks
(524 and 415). Frecl Lindrum, therefore, retains
the championship. The brothers met twice last rear
iu 18,000 games, and Fred won one h.v 6588, and
Walter took the other by 1512. The casualness of
the recent conflict woke Fred Weiss up,' though, and
a challenge from the veteran was deposited on
Frederick’s doorstep.

Clarence Weber: In a recent Bulletin
par. “M.I’.A.” mentions that in my contest with
Buttan Singh, the Indian was quite within his
rights to choke me down with a strangle-hold. As a
matter of fact, it was stated in the programme (1
cannot put my hand on it for the minute) and also
made clear by the circus announcer that the strangle
and all injurious holds were barred. If any old hold
was allowed in such contests, even if no articles or
arrangement were agreed upon, the struggle would
resolve itself into a dog-fight. Singh had barely two
minutes to place my two shoulders on the mat or
lose his forfeit money. He was perilously close to
losing his cash, so he put the kybosh on me and then
ran for his life, pursued by a bunch of cowhovs and
a number of bluejackets. Even an impromptu con-
test should be governed by fair-play rules.

Dusky Sam Jennings is. scheduled to leave
Bathurst on 20th inst. at 6.30 a.m. for a 126 miles’
stroll to Sydney, which, if the time-table is not to
fall in a heap, must lie reached by half an hour
after midday on Saturday. This doesn’t leave Sam
much time for a yarn and a smoke when he happens
to meet a mate on the road, and the probabilities
are that if he arrives on time he will be a very
footsore and sleepy tourist. Four miles an hour
for 30 consecutive hours is apt to create that tired
feeling in even the best-trained citizen. Anyway, as
Sam is. on this stunt for patriotic purposes Tub
Bulletin hopes he will get through satisfactorily.
Last week he had a trial from Hill End to Bathurst,
’ 54-$ miles, the intention being to finish in 101 hours.
But Sam dallied too long by the wayside taking up
collections, and the clock had him well beaten. At
the Bathurst Spring Show next month he threatens
to smash that record of his which wiped out the
“Flying Pieman,” by wheeling a spring-cart a mile,
running a mile, walking another, pushing a barrow
a fourth mile, clearing 50 3ft. 6in. hurdles, picking
up stones a yard apart (and any spare cash about
the ground) and walking half a mile.

Cecil Healy finished the other day at 36,
a lieutenant with the A.1.F., in France. He was
among the best-known of Australian swimmers, and
the appropriator of many championships. For two
or three’ years he was usually just behind Dick Cavell,
but in 1905 he grabbed the 100 yards’ championship
in the then record time of 58sec. and held it for
six years. He represented Australia at the Olympic
Games (Athens and Stockholm), and on those
journeys also swam with success at other places in
Europe.

B. G. Orchard, who gathered Newington
(Sydney) College Cup last week, arrived first at
220 yards, 880 yards and mile ; second in 100 yards,
and thirds in 440 yards, broad jump and high jump.
Last year he attracted notice in the same way. He
is a son of the M.I-I.R.

A couple of North Sydney High lads
disturbed the leaves of the Schools’ record-book last
week. The star performer was R. Lewers, who won
both the Junior (Bft. 6in.) and Senior (9ft. Sin.)
vaulting championships, and in a further. try added
an inch to R. Harbison’s record of 9ft. sin. L.
Bannister was the other record-smasher, winning
the 100 yards' junior championship in 10 3-10 sec.
Bannister, though only 15 years of age, is one of the
smartest sprinters N. S. Wales has seen for a long
spell. He has picked up the school junior sprint
championship for the past three years, and last year
won the N. S. Wales All Schools’ 100 yards’ cham-
pionship in 10 4-ssec.


There is a Way to Perfect
Health!
That way is open to YOU. Will you travel it ?
The only way to improve Nature is through natural
methods.
Drugs and apparatus usually show no results, and are often
injurious. Under my method fifteen minutes each day m
vowr own room are sufficient. I have thousands of students
in all parts of Australia and New Zealand who are now
enjoying good health.. Previously a large number of these
people were stiffereiv. from indigestion, constipation and
other disorders which are the direct result of tire internal
muscles being much below normal.
My exercises pay particular attention to the muscles that
govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels, and
quickly bring them back to a healthy state again.
Surely you want to enjoy the best of health ? Then why
not write to-day for full particulars of my
Postal Course of Health and Strength Culture?
This is proof, of what I say:—-
“Dear Sir, —I aim getting- along- splendidly with my
exercises. .My weight has increased 151 b., chest expan-
sion Min., waist T.Jin., calf Jin., forearm tin., neck
lin. " “(Signed) J. 8., Bodangorfi, N.S.W.”
.'Many hundreds of letteiu from pupils all over Australia and
New Zealand are fti the same strain.

Faint and saggy at the feet... .M.M.: Anybody who

pretty poor stuff... .M. O’M.: Thin. .. . Aonian: Fair
sonnet; but the world is full of fair sonnets....
A.G.: “Conspiracy” wanted more skill. .. .R.M.:
Must go back.... Mag: Represents a futile struggle
after mirth... .R.P.: Sermon in cramped handwrit-
ing too dull. Send it to the Bishop and he’ll make
you his friend for life. .. .E.A.K.: No use....
H.P.8.: If you’ve read the paper as closely as that
you should know that we don’t rhyme “jaw” with
“galore.”... . IT.M.: We have had about 2697 poems
entitled “Somewhere in France,” and yours by merit
stands about half-way in the list. .. .No Name: “Song

seen. .. ,0,B.: “Feathers” does it: —
It matters not how far or where it goes,
For it always makes friends and never a foe ;
Even the little birds nestling loves them you know,
As you will see them flying to and fro.
Feathers, feathers, feathers.
To see our beautiful friends that we adore,
Often burnt or thrown outside the door ;
Why not save until you get some more?
For there’s plenty in need and feeling sore.
Feathers, feathers, feathers.

Have You Had Influenza?
There are certain disorders such as influ-
enza, that especially debilitate and make the
body an easy prey for more dangerous dis-
eases. Ask those who have had the influenza
regarding the present condition of their
health and most of them will answer, ‘’Since
I had influenza I have never been well.”
They still have profuse perspiration, the per-
sistent weakness of the limbs, the disorgan-
ised digestion, shortness of breath and palpi-
tation of the heart caused bv the thin-
blooded condition in which influenza almost
always leaves its victim after the fever and
influenza have subsided. They are, further-
more, at the mercy of relapses and complica-
tions, often very serious. In an attack of
influenza there is a rapid thinning of the
blcod, and not until the blood is built up
again is complete heath restored.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills quickly make the
blood rich and red, drive out the lingering
germs from the system and transform de-
spondent influenza victims into cheerful,
healthy men and women.
Try the pills for any form of debility
caused by thin blood.
All chemists sell Dr. Williams’ Pink. Pills.

Elizabeth Spencer ,
a famous soprano, who has
demonstrated by actual tone
tests the ability of The NEW
EDISON to ''re-create " the
living voice.
The NEW EDISON
—the perfect instrument
‘‘Thomas A. Edison, sometimes called the ‘Wizard/ has, we are told,
perfected a device that actually ‘re-creates’ the human voice and
musical tone. If he has really done this, the present and coming
generations have much to thank him for, in addition to the many
things for which they are already indebted to him. Knowing what
Edison has done in the past, we do not in the least doubt the assertion
that he has accomplished this seemingly impossible thing.”
Thus wrote, some time ago, the Winchester Musical News —an
American publication.
That The NEW EDISON fully achieves all things claimed for it, is
now well known —and endorsed —by thousands of musical critics the
world over.

“Nerves”
Oar nerves are similar to an intri-
cate network of telegraph wires.
Controlled and nourished by a
portion of the brain —known as
the nerve centres —the delicate
threadlike nerves radiate in all
directions throughout the body.
So long as the nerve centres are
capable of continually supplying
nourishment to the nerves, the
nerves will remain strong and
healthy. But directly the nerve
centres become weakened by
overwork, worry or anxiety, they
are unable to transmit the
necessary nourishment, and the
nerves become worn out and
“on edge.” Then it is that a sud-
den sound makes you “jump”
—you get irritable —you sutler
from neuralgia—you are rest-
less and depressed. In this con-
dition there is nothing to equal

The Warilda, Australian hospital-ship,
having gone to join the Wimmera and others
that sleep with David Jones at the sea-
bottom. the big Wyreema was at once pro-
posed as its successor. This is one of tire
few vessels which remain in what Dr.
Arthur. M.L.A. (N.S.W.), scornfully
describes as the luxurious 30b ol
“carrying trippers to Cairns. But the
people who live on the long, long stie t
which is past the end of the railway mention
that the Wyreema is the last boat with
refrigerating apparatus left to them, and
if it is taken off and not replaced hunch eds
of tons of food will be given to the dog, and
the dog will die through over-feeding, and
prices in the southern cities will go up again,
and thousands of people will want more
wages because of the increased cost ot Hy-
ing: Still, thank goodness, something is
being done. On the same day (22/8/IS)
that the Sydney papers published the story
about the butter and the dog and the cost ot
living it was stated, all in one paragraph,
that - (1) a proposal for building.two large
ships at Williamstown was “under consider-
ation-' : (2) the authorities had allotted
right vessels for construction at \Y illiams-
town yards” ; (3) the Acting Naval Minister
“hoped” the vessel now being constructed at
Williamstown would be “ready for launching
within about four months”; (4) a start
would shortly be made on the construction
of a second vessel”; (5) arrangements had
been “practically completed” for the begin
ning of four steel ships at Adelaide; (t>)
the Acting Minister proposed to lay the keels
of three steel ships at Newcastle on beptem-
ber 0; (7) Mr. Hughes would inquire in
England about how concrete ships are built.
“F.”: Is the tangle of contradictions re
air-fighting results never to be straightened
out? For two years or more it has been
the same confusion of British and German
figures, no mention of French losses in the
air ever being made. Take some figures from
last Tuesday week’s cables. I leld-Marshal
Sir Douglas Haig reported
We destroyed 29 machines and drove down -4.
Five British "machines are missing. Our anti-aircralt
<runs brought clown a Gotha machine.
Immediately following comes an official Ger-
man communique, forwarded by the Bntis
Admiralty/ .
We shot down in July 513 aeroplanes, of which
239 are in our possession. We lost 129 machines.
The German monthly, account of aeroplane
losses, on both sides is always utterly at vari-
ance with the almost daily reports trom
Haig. The conflict of evidence grows monot-
onous, yet there has never been an official
attempt to set public curiosity at rest on tne
question as to which side is telling lies, oi
as to why glaring contradictions are periodi-
cally issued by naval authorities if there is
no value in the German figures. Either they
are worth attention, in which case the YV ar
Office in London owes an explanation to the
public, or they are not worth considering, in
which case the Admiralty's repetitions ol
German communiques suggest ill-teeling
towards the other arm of the service. Any-
way, these rival indirect assertions ot men-
dacity against the other fellow are irritating.
Did the Germans actually capture 239 Allied
aeroplanes last month, or is Berlin auda-
ciously misrepresenting the facts? v\e are
told to hope the Allies will finally win the
war from the air. We want reasonable justi-
fication of the hope. On the German show-
ing we have little justification, and the Ger-
man showing is passed by the Censor.
The Vic. Western District is greatly exer-
cised in its mind about repatriation matters,
there being two separate schemes which it
has been called on to support, one engineered
by Arthur Rodgers, M.H.R., and, another,
the Repatriation Department’s plan. Many
townships have a Rodgers committee and a
district (Government) ditto, with every
opportunity for side-trackings and general
discord, winch is not too good for returned
Billjim. Rodgers’ pertinacity and plain
talk have had good results in cash-and-
kind contributions from district squatters
and farmers; while his successful agitation
has had the effect of putting the Federal
repatriators on their mettle. Still, the time
seems ripe for getting all together, in Bill -
jim’s interests, and the Rodgers section is
beginning to do its share of olive-branching
by starting employment bureaus, joined up
with the Government scheme. The handling
of its own cash and lands, of course, is quite
another matter, those behind Rodgers pro-
bably reckoning that their intimate and effec-
tive labors among and on behalf of the re-
turned soldier may be favorably compared
with the work of Milieu’s department.
“O. Blin’s” certificate of character: —
There is more than mere hearsay behind the
allegation that there is a strong strain of insanity
in the Hohenzollern family. Anyhow, I can charge
the Kaiser with hereditary insanity on the evidence
of his family tree, which has several first-class
madmen hanging to its branches. One of his rela-
tives was the cranky Paul, of Russia, who was
massacred by a set of military conspirators. Wilhelm
has Paul’s dilly outbursts of passion, coupled with
his megalomania, childishness and fondness for uni-
forms. Further, he has an eccentricity about colors
which almost any alienist will diagnose unfavorably.
Like Huysman’s neurotic hero, Des Esseintes, Bill is
periodically affected by certain tints, and he will
derive sensuous satisfaction by having that hue about
him until some other color takes his fancy. Some
of Wilhelm’s sons, notably the Crown Prince and
Eitel Friedrich, show signs of criminal degeneracy,
whilst his royal relative, Friedrich Leopold of
Prussia, is cracked in several places. This powerful
and wealthy potentate pursues an existence of almost
complete isolation in his palace at Potsdam. He
spends most of his days mooning about a private
garden approached by a tunnel, which he had built
for his exclusive use. He chronically abuses his
wife, cuts off her income, and once walloped her
with his fist before a terrified circle of flunkeys.
Also he likes cutting the throats of tame animals.
But his quaintest habit is the engagement of a mili-
tary band on the birthday of himself and the other
members of his family. This is his birthday gift,
but in order to maintain his rigid Prussian ideas
of precedence, the hand always plays for him for
three hours, for his wife two, and for each of his
children, 60 minutes. Curiously enough, the only
decent members of the Prussian reigning house are
Leopold’s sons, one of whom, a good sport and a
great admirer of the English, was recently killed in
an aeroplane on the Western front.

Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills
JUST WHAT YOU NEED.
Mrs. J. S. WOODSIDE (from a photo).
Craigielee,
Craigend Street,
Darlinghurst.
Dear Sirs, —
Many times when I
have read what other
women think of your
“Gin Pills,” I thought
of writing to tell you
my opinion of them,
which is that there is
nothing in the world
like them for women.
I have been a constant
user of them for many
years, and consider
that my present fine
health and strength is
due to their beneficial
effects. They clear the
head and the kidneys,
and are invaluable for
the many ills women
are prone to suffer. I
send you my photo-
graph and give you my
full permission to make
public what I say about
Gin Pills. My advice to all women is to take a Gin Pill now and then —
there is nothing so good. Gin Pills are sure to help you. This sounds
a big thing to say, but it’s true.
I remain, yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) JESSIE S. WOODSIDE.
GIN PILLS WILL HELP YOU.
If you feel that your Kidneys are the cause of your illness, your run-down feeling:,
begin taking Dr. Sheldon’s (Jin Pills for Backache and Kidney Trouble, because as
soon as your Kidneys improve they will help the other organs to health.
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills for Backache and Kidney Trouble relieve the worst cases
because they remove the cause of such troubles; they get to the root of the matter,
clean out the Kidneys, and make them iilter out all the poisonous waste matters
and uric acids that lodge in the joints and muscles, causing Rheumatism. They
soothe and heal the bladder, and quickly relieve you. They are a unique remedy,
entirely different from anything you have ever used. There is nothing else to com-
pare with them. Jio matter how old you are, or how long you have suffered, the
very principle of Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills is such that it is practically impossible to
take them into the human system without obtaining results.
If you suffer with pains in your back or tildes, or have any signs of Kidney
Trouble or Rheumatism, such as puffy swellings under the eyes or in the feet or
ankles, if you are Nervous, Tired and Run-down, or bothered with Urinary Dis-
orders, Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills for Backache and Kidney Trouble are the remedy
which will quickly relieve you of your misery. Price 1/6 and 2/6.

A Ballad of the Wizard Earl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[Gerald the Poet, fourth Earl of Desmond, and
generally known as the Wizard Earl, was the son of
a Fitzgerald and Ainey, a spirit of the air—formerly
a Danaan goddess. The Wizard Earl disappeared in
1398, and is fabled to live with his mother under
the waters of Loch Gur. The peas mentioned here
were grown on the hill still called Knockainey.]
GERALD of Song—God shield the
cows —■
Went forth with hound and horn.
The sun was on the oaken boughs,
The summer on the corn.
And fair he looked and tall he stood —
Och, cross your breast and pray!
’Twas fear that sat on hill and wood
When Gerald’s horn would play.
A secret word there was to tell
Beside Loch Gur’s soft water
Of trysting by the hazel well
With Owel’s bright-haired daughter.
Without the priest, without the book,
’Twas Gerald’s father wed
The sweet white woman, kind of look,
That lives among the dead.
Sure, Ainey walks upon the air
Ten thousand summers long;
But Gerald’s father wooed her fair
With lover lips and song.
And Gerald was the son she bore—
Och, cross your breast and pray!
For fear was ever at the door
When Gerald’s horn would play.
Yet in # his mouth the speech was good;
And when he stooped to sing
Above his harp, the sweet old wood
Made apple-murmuring.
Within his blood the strange fire slept;
And at the turn of June
He made no shadow as he stept
Below the shining moon.
Gerald of Song—God shield the cows—
Och, shame of mortal sin !
’Twas sorrow on the spades and ploughs
And harvest blighted thin.
The lights moved up the hill at night,
Queer voices filled the air;
But hunger came with, winter white—
The poor man’s house was bare.
The cross above the chapel fell,
The cows were thin and dry;
And frosty-cold the bitter bell
_ Below a hard, grey sky.
Yet Gerald’s house had fire and wine
And store of flesh and bread;
The poor man saw the casements shine
To make the darkness red.
’Twas Gerald rode across the land,
The good song in his mouth.
Och, fair he was of word and hand
As Spring winds of the south.
But fear it. was of mortal sin
Through hunger biting sore—
The women took the children in
And shut and barred the door.
There came an old wife bending low
Before him on the road —
“ ’Tis you that would not let them grow,
The field of peas I sowed!
The meal is spent, the world is dead;
You laugh and give no heed.
Saint Brigid’s curse upon your head!
God’s curse upon your breed!”
’Twas Gerald stooped his head to hear
The word her lips let fall.
He saw her drop the slow, cold tear
Upon her thin, grey shawl.
“Old mother, ’tis no deed of mine
That board and hearth are bare ;
For heedless come the rain and shine
Of all my word and prayer.”
“My peas,” she said, field of peas;
They stood so good and green!
The grass is gone below the trees;
The cows are dry and lean.”
A sob was in her withered throat;
The bitter wind went by.
’Twas Gerald saw the cold clouds float
Across the cold, dark sky.
’Twas Gerald threw his house doors wide
That all might enter in;
But liefer had the poor man died
Than seek that place of sin.
The thin voice of the chapel bell
Was on the winter air
That hunger might to hunger tell
Its bitter want in prayer.
’Twas Gerald took his harp at night
And went along the hill;
And some there were saw light on light
That passed to work them ill.
For down the land a music swayed
That told how trembling string,
Sweet-smitten in the darkness, made
An apple-murmuring.
Up came the day in yellow light;
And all the children saw
The hedges dripping in their sight
Before the sudden thaw.
Loch Gur was like a summer sea;
A small wind stirred the trees —
Och. heart, look up! And can it beV
The hill was green with peas!
’Twas Ainey came, at Gerald’s call
With horse and plough of wind:
’Twas Ainey let the good seed fall
And made the hillside kind.
Och. cross yourself on brow and breast!
The Strange Folks’ deeds are sweet.
The wind was laughing in the west
The peas were good to eat.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GAOL is an interesting place. It is a
theatre where all the actqrs are real.
Nobody plays an imaginary part, I
mean —each man plays himself. And. playing
himself, he plays humanity. He plays
out all the human passions of which our
nature is capable; consequently. I would say
to the bored superior person: “Do not go to
Medlow. Do not go to the Melbourne Cup.
Go to gaol.”
Gaol is the great wake-up. I woke up there
to a thousand things that books could never
teach me. I woke up to a proper realisation
of the extraordinary moral complexity ot iite.
I saw that the so-called civilised man and
the wild beast have often only a sheet ol
paper, between them; and it only requires the
judicial endorsement of that sheet to remove
the frock-coat, the gold watch and the silk
hat, and thus reveal the primal animal.
Gaol, too, is a great revealer of human
goodness. Underneath the foulest exterior
one comes across the essential Man. Nothing
amazed me more, I recall, than sudden and
utterly unexpected kindnesses received from
men whom 1 had previously regarded with
unspeakable hatred. There was the time, for
instance, when I was given three days cells
—that meant bread and water only, with no
books and no light—for telling a warder that
he had not enough brains to equip a bed-bug.
It was the truth, too. Anyway, I got three
days’ cells for it, and when I came out 1
could have eaten Paris House to a stand-
still. Up to my martyrdom’s retreat
promptly came a man, a typical habitua
criminal, whose very face was repulsive.
“Here you are, bloke,” he said. “Have my
breakfast. Get you another in a minute.
And he slid down the A Hall stairs that
instant and “pinched” me another dish o
liominy.
Twenty (his number) bounced abruptly
into my life one afternoon in the appeal-
yards at Long Bay. He was a down-to-date
Sydney larrikin. Pie wore the clothes of the
twentieth-century a.d., and he had mental
outlook of the twentieth-century B.c. He
was a young man of twenty-five or twenty-
six, with an extraordinary projecting sort of
flat nose like a duck’s bill, and he wore his
jet-black hair plastered down over his low,
retreating forehead in proper larrikin style.
He was up in the air, one hour, in the
highest spirits; in the next, he would be
down in the bluest depths of the blues, and
ready to cry with blind exasperation. His
language was awful. Twenty had been a
tramway employee of some description. Mean-
while liis occupation was his appeal on the
grounds that he had not committed the
offence in June, as alleged, but in October!
I spent about six months, myself, in the
appeal-yards at Long Bay. Twenty was
there for about a month. Then, of course,
his appeal was turned down, with neatness
and despatch, and Twenty went to Goulburn.
These appeal-yards are worth describing.
Imagine a series of about a dozen brick-work
cages, built side by side, with iron bars at the
front and top ; a brick wall at the back, and
with practically no effective roofing whatever.
The second-timers’ yard is a large one, but
all the rest are about 12ft. wide. One of
these yards might contain from six to a
dozen men. The length of the “cage” is,
approximately, twice the width, with a hard
asphalted floor and one deal form to sit on.
No books are allowed in the yard, though an
exception was made in my case, when I went
into a yard by myself. The appellant’s food
is reduced to the lowest possible limit —the
No. 1 ration. It was very hot whilst Twenty
shared an appeal-yard with me. Anyone who
wants to sample Hell can try those.yards—
try them for preference in midsummer. Later,
when it rained with torrential fury, we were
soaked to the skin for lack of shelter.
When I met Twenty again he was making
boots in Goulburn Gaol. So was I. The
bootshop in that prison is part of a very
long, narrow, two-storey brick building. The
upper flock has the store-room and bootshop
at one end. with the tailor’s-shop at the
other. In the centre there is a sort of cage,
the full width of the shops, fashioned with
vertical iron bars. Here a warder with a
rifle was formerly placed, but in my time
that narrow central cage was used for
making bags. The only armed men in the
gaol during working hours were the “screws”
on tower-duty. Hygienically considered, the
Goulburn bootshop is as big a mistake as
the appeal-yard arrangements at Long Bay.
In winter it is like an ice-house, and in
summer it is a human coke-furnace. In the
back wall there are three or four windows,
made on the cell-window principle, about one
foot high and three feet wide, and there is a
door and a couple of windows in the front,
but as a workshop the place is unfit for usp.
Anyway, here Twenty and I resumed our
goal acquaintance. The system of gaol is
maddening. If a man can set type they give
him a jolt at sawing wood. If he is a
plumber, they will probably set him solderin'--
pants together in the tailor’s-shop. As for
me, I am a fair blacksmith and a passable
carpenter, so of course they set me making
boots. It was a new world for me. When
I began to w-ork I found that I had about
twenty-close companions. They ran in all
shapes and sizes. There were three or four
men who were doing life for murder. There
was one man who was doing fifteen years for
manslaugher. There was another putting in
seven years for stabbing his mistress; and
there were all sorts of others drifting through
Sentences ranging from a couple of years to
Governor’s pleasure. And there was Tolstoi’s
double—the canary king, Sparrow Jack.
_ Sparrow Jack is another story. I men-
tion him here because, after a time,
when I was promoted to the bench, and
started making women’s boots, I had to
work within a yard of Twenty. And
Twenty’s language began to make me tired.
In order to get him to knock off swearing I
got Sparrow Jack to lend me one of his
tame canaries (he had them perched all
over him). This bird I sub-let, as it were,
to Twenty, allowing him to have it con-
stantly with him, provided that he would
cut out the language. It worked like a
charm.. It was wonderful to see that little
bird living its merry life in gaol. Twenty
made a little cross —a couple of pieces of
stick tacked together—and nailed it to his
bench-box. so that Dick could hop about on
it and whistle. Whistle! How that bird
whistled ! I have repeatedly seen the whole
shopful of human nondescripts momentarily
give over working, just to look at Twenty and
his bird. The man was so pleased with his
pet that he actually ceased to swear. And
when the little fluffy, yellow-coated creature
would hop down off his perch into the peg-
box, flirting boot-pegs all over the place;
doing it, too, with his head on one side apd
looking so cunning—whenever the canary
did that Twenty’s happmoss was comnhffe.
He was like a woman with her first baby.
At night he kept the canary with him in his
(Continued on next page.)


GET AT THE CAUSE!
Get at the cause of your illness.
It is a waste of time trying to cure
the symptoms when the cause is
deep-rooted. If you suffer with back-
ache or weak back, headache, ner-
vousness, gravel, urinary disorder,
irregular action of the heart, dizzi-
ness, retching, pale complexion, etc.,
stop and think, “What causes my
trouble ? ” “ Why am I ill ? ” Let us
tell you. These are symptoms of
kidney trouble. You may have only
one of these symptoms, and your
neighbor another, for kidney trouble
affects different people differently.
But at the first sign of anything
wrong with your health find out the
cause, and treat the cause. Nearly
every ill “the flesh is heir to” is
due to disordered kidneys. There-
fore, when you don’t feel as well as
you ought, look after your kidneys —
give them help. Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills are special kidney help.
They cure every ill of the kidneys
and bladder, and are perfectly safe
for all, men and women, old and
young.

my back. These pains prevented me from bending,
or getting proper rest at night, and seriously ham-
pered me when attending to my household duties.
Sometimes I was so bad that I could hardly move,
and if I tried to get about the house the pain was
almost unbearable. After trying all sorts of
remedies, without success, Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills were brought under my notice, so I got some,
and they did me good almost at once. After tak-
ing two bottles of these pills 1 was ever so much
better, and eight bottles completely cured me. That
was twelve months ago, and I have been well ever
since. I always keep a bottle of Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills in the house and take a dose occa-
sionally, and they keep me in splendid health.”
Six years later Mrs. Wilkinson says:—“l have
been free from backache since Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me seven years ago.”
Mr. .Tas. Wilson. 17 Little Buckingham Street,
Sydney, says:—“For a long time I suffered torture
from backache and kidney trouble. The pains in
my back were very severe, and I have been sd bad
that I could not attend to my work, as every move-
ment caused positive torture. The kidney secre-
tions were affected, being thick and cloudy, and
containing a red sediment. I was also subject to
dizzy feelings, and could not sleep properly at
night. Nothing I took seemed able to give me any
permanent relief, but one day when I was feeling
very bad I heard good reports of Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, so I sent for some, and after taking
seven bottles I was cured. This remedy not only
banished the backache, but strengthened and toned
up my kidneys and improved my general health.
It is two years since I was cured, and I have had
no trouble with my kidneys since.”
Mr. Wilson confirms the above four years later:
“I am still well, and have had no return of back-
ache and kidney trouble since Doan’s Pills cured
me six years ago.”

cell, and in the exercise-yard he would carry
it about on his finger. Deep down beneath
the ununderstandable of Twenty’s nature
there was something that was good. It
required the canary to bring it out.
One day Twenty’s wife and child came to
see him. He went over to the visiting-room
with his bird perched on his finger, and
when the child saw it she wanted it—wanted
if. in the sudden imperative way of children.
Twenty was between ten devils and the
seven seas. He was torn to give it to the
child, and he wanted to keep it. Anyhow,
it wasn’t his to give;—it was Sparrow Jack’s,
and so that settled it. Twenty came back
from the visit with tears on his face.
Next day, whilst Twenty was walking
around from the bootshop to B wing, the
canary suddenly hopped from his finger to
his shoulder. That was a thing that it did
continually. But this time the bird looked
up, as a human being might look, at the
blue sky—and went! It was the end of
the new Twenty.
Gaol offences are numerous. Having a
scrap of a daily paper is one; and having the
smallest portion of “flat” tobacco, i.e., the
sort of civilised stuff that men smoke out-
side, is another. Refusing to work is also a
heinous offence, and there are a hundred others
which a malicious “screw” can manufacture
upon the spot. Every warder lias the power
to lock up a prisoner at a second’s notice.
He can charge him before, a magistrate with
an offence, and if he is a big enough liar,
as a warder sometimes is, he can punish an
innocent and defenceless man with anything
up to a week’s “solitary.” It was through
this sort of impenitential process that
Twenty now commenced to go. Hating
the bootshop, he refused to work, and
took the consequences. Punishment did
not seem to hurt him. He would
merely swear and cry by turns, and then
come out to curse the bootshop and the
bootshop “screw” with greater ardor than
ever,
“Twenty’s in again!” One heard that
continually. Gaol is a horribly small-minded
place, and men who have nothing else to
amuse them often seem to get pleasure out
of the contemplation of other’s sufferings.
It is a life that makes men hard, insular and
bestial. For a man like Twenty, without
poise, without the internal power of command,
one small, petty-minded “screw” or overseer
can convert it into a perfect hell. This
trouble went on for a couple of months. And
then Leo Tolstoi the Second took compassion
on Twenty and gave him a sparrow—just a
plain, ordinary, every-day sparrow, which
Sparrow Jack himself had reared and tamed.
Simultaneously, Twenty was shifted from
the bootshop, and given a job as middle-
landing sweeper in B wing. He owed that
to Governor Urquhart—plain Bill Urquhart,
a true gentleman, a Scot of Scots and a
man.
The new bird and the new job worked
wonders. It would be hard to say which
affected Twenty the most. From being the
“most impossible” man in the gaol he went
through a second canary-metamorphosis.
He began to read again, and even commenced
to write. Most remarkable pencilled screeds
he brought me; pure nonsense, alternated
with stolen slabs from Oliver Goldsmith.
But one day Twenty resolved to dye his
sparrow. He took it up to the bootshop
and gave it a coating of red-brown
polish. Three coatings the bird got. Its
feathers shone. They took on the tinge of
a beautiful golden-brown. And the sparrow,
being a born larrikin itself, seemed to enjoy
the change tremendously. It put on airs
like a human being—Society, by the way, is
full of dyed sparrows—and it refused to
associate with any of the other sparrows
owned by prisoners in Number Five yard.
That yard was full of men with pets. First
there was the deaf man with the rat. The
little creature used to run up the legs of its
owner's trousers and in and out of his shirt
and coat-sleeves. Then there was the man with
the starling, that used to sit and chirp all
day beside him in the tinsmith’s shop. Then
there was the sailor with the plain, unvar-
nished sparrow. I had a pet, too. It was
a little kitten about the size of nothing. It
used to live in my pocket, and it had a
wonderfully funny way of putting out its head.
Whenever we were marching into B wing
old Robert Scholl, the gruff, dictatorial-
seeming, but truly human-hearted chief
warder, used to look at that comical little
out-thrust head and smile from ear to ear.
Twenty’s dyed sparrow became the boss
of the yard, but its end was pitiful. One
morning, when we came out at six-thirty
to wash, Twenty left the sparrow in his cell.
At seven o’clock he went upstairs in a hurry
and crushed the little bird with his foot.
It was standing at the cell-door —standing
there, with its head on one side, as usual,
looking for Twenty. What must that miser-
able man have felt in his heart, thus to un-
wittingly slay his soul.
The bird was buried in Yard Five. A head-
stone of tin bore this inscription:—
R.I.P.
TIDDLES.

GRANT HERVEY.
The Woman with the Cloak.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DENISON’S car cut silkily through the
stilly coldness of the winter night,
and Denison thought of the slender
moon so high and remote that it was set
like a silver seal on the blue envelope men
call the sky. For Denison had been born
with the soul of a minor poet; but it was
because he had also been given the brain of
a financial genius that he came to be sitting
in the luxurious Rolls Royce, chewing rather
vexedly at a very good cigar and visioning
his nearing matrimonial responsibilities.
Having reached the age of forty-two Deni-
son had determined to marry. He hadn’t
confided this fact to either of the two women
who had been displaying their points in the
matrimonial market for his bidding. Both
Mildred and Rachel were magnificent crea-
tures. and Denison was mentally reviewing
the physical charms of each. For Denison
was a man of money and consequent power,
and he would come with his arms loaded
with gifts to the woman he would marry;
therefore, as a business proposition, he
demanded in return that his wife should
possess all that makes woman desirable to
man. He thought of Mildred in the all-
revealing costume she had worn in her revue
that evening. What a superb animal she
was! Every movement tinged with a re-
strained grace—the silken leash of civilisa-
tion on an abounding vitality that was
savage in its strength. He thought of Rachel
as he had seen her the night before at her
mother’s dinner-party, in a gown that left
none of her beauties to the imagination—the
girl’s mother was determined that not an
inch of superfluous material should extin-
guish the shining glory of her daughter’s
body. Rachel, too, bore the hall-mark of
social recognition....
The car came to a standstill in front of an
imposing building of flats, and Denison dis-
missed his thoughts and his driver at the same
moment. He crossed the vestibule, warm
with flowers and subdued lights, and a
second afterwards the lift deposited him
before the door of his own suite.
Letting himself in, he paused irresolute,
for sitting in a low chair before the fire was
a young woman. Denison guessed her youth
from the sunny gleams of her hair; her face
was turned from him, and her contour was
hidden by a loose cloak of a golden brown
hue that reminded him of an autumn leaf.
As Denison paused trying to frame his
belief that the visitor had made a mistake in
the number of the flat, the girl turned her
head and smiled at him.
“You see I gained sufficient courage to-
night to come in and sit by your fire,” she
said.
“I trust you have been comfortable,”
answered the mystified Denison.
“Oh, quite,” she replied, and delicately
crossed one foot over the other.
Denison noted that the feet and ankles
showed small and well-shaped in spite of the
thick stockings and heavy shoes. Then he
found himself sitting in an armchair at the
other side of the fire regarding his visitor
with a puzzled expression, every bit of that
keen brain of his on guard. Was this the
preliminary to a pretty little case of black-
mail? The girl leaned forward with a flut-
tering smile, and the cloak slipped lower on
her shoulders, revealing a round young throat
rising from a slightly low-cut muslin blouse
—the skirt, he noticed, where the cloak fell
open, was of the same sprigged pattern.
There was a something hauntingly familiar
about the girl that teasingly eluded Denison’s
memory.
Her gaze swept the room, and the man felt
embarrassment at the daring pictures and
statuettes in the apartment. He found him-
self edging his chair sideways that it might
cut off her view of the latest picture of Mil-
dred on the table behind him.
But the girl was talking to him eagerly, a
little wistfully: “I have so often longed to
speak to you—but to-night it is imperative
that, I do so.” Again she offered him the
fluttering little smile that whipped his
memory.
And then a strange thing happened to
Denison ; for he found himself talking, not
in the cynical tones of the man who has
found that money is the price for all things,
but as the young boy who had so nearly been
a poet might have spoken ; of the beautiful
and true in art; of his aspirations to be
worthy of the big and great things. He
found himself telling her of the Madonnas
the Masters had painted, and it flashed upon
him how beautiful the girl opposite would be
with a child in her arms —his child and hers
- —all the sweetness of her soul in the child’s
eyes. Stronger within him grew the convic-
tion that the things that mattered were the
simple virtues —great because of their sim-
plicity. Her eyes were wells of purifying
thought where a man’s soul became new
washed and grew glad again. Now and then
the girl spoke, prompting some new-old
thought to a warm vitality. Under the clear
thought behind her words, the lure of the
flesh that wrapped book and painting and
statue in his rooms seemed withered and
shrunken around the decay within. Deni-
son’s soul was stirred to its depths.
The little clock upon the mantel com-
menced to chime the first hour of the new
day, as the girl rose drawing her cloak more
closely about her. “I must go,” she said.
Denison, too, stood up. mute with a sense
of great loss till she reached the door. Then
he flung out a detaining hand.
“Un not leave me,” he implored—“without
at least telling me who you are.”
Over the cloak the girl’s face showed as a
star shining above a dark place.
She smiled her vaguely familiar fluttering
smile: “My name,” she whispered, “my name
is Modesty.”
But as her eyes looked for the last time
into his. the tantalising memory sprang to
vivid flame, and Denison knew her for his
first sweetheart who had died at seventeen.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Were all the stars but mine to spend
I’d take a purse of air
And travel to the rainbow’s end
To buy the wonders there.
And still with half my wealth unspent
I’d barter light for gems—
The fortunes of the Gypsy’s tent
And fairy diadems.
For all the pearls of all the sea
I’d pay the highest price ;
I’d buy old spice of Memory
And wines of Paradise.
And under rosy arches tall
I'd homeward drive my cart,
And take the loaded treasures all
To bank them in your heart.

IMPORTANT.—LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, coinfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decay).
