“Certainly no such distinctive verse has appeared
among us for years.”—Sydney Morning Herald.
“ A collection of really admirable poems. There is no
mistaking the swing of his verses. Small wonder that
that suclt lines as these should stir the hearts of men. .
We might go on quoting indefinitely.”—The Queens’-
Landkr.
“A welcome addition to the scanty roll of writers of
distinctively Australian verse. The writer knows how to
tell a stirring incident in a spirited and vigorous manner,
and the local coloring is exact and truthful. He is evi-
dently quite familiar with every aspect of bush and
station life.”—Ausrralasian.
“The body of what lies between these covers is in some
respects distinctly better, as Australian literature, than
the few of Gordon’s poems in which the local element has
been made unmistakeahle.”—Sydney Daily Telegraph.
“The dominant tone is that of an intense affection and
longing for the wild, free, natural life of the country.”—
Town and Country Journal.
“I tell you, friends, this hook of ‘ Banjo’s’ is the best
thing I have seen done in Australia. It is pathetic,
humorous,strong, descriptive, and—Australian!”—Stock
and Station Journal.
“The volume teems with vivid pictures , . . and
all is told in vigorous verse, having a splendid swing and
freedom.”—Maitland Mercury.
“In my opinion this collection comprises the best bush
ballads written since the death of Lindsay Gordon.”—
“ Roi. 7 Boldrewood.”

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Heanxe’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HE ARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healiner power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cute? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully. J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

Dr. GIBBOMS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely : —Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, Ac.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

that beneficient annihilator of pain
and preventitive of its return,
Canadian Healing Oil,
a combination of six medicinal oils, devoid
of alcohol, and consequently non-evapor-

little of it is usually required to produce
the desired effects, and the small cost of
which is rendered doubly insignificant by
contrast with the salutary results which it
achieves. It is equally safe whether taken
internally or externally, is applicable to
diseases and injuries of horses and cattle,
as well as toman, and exterminates Throat

ber of other physical ailments.

The word is suggestive. Many dealers keep their
customers very much in the dark as to the true
state of things. So to speak, they get behind their
own blinds because the circumstances won’t allow
them to emerge into the full light.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE IN CHINA
writes as follows
I should like to mentnai certain matters in connection
with the blind trade. With every order I place I INSIST
ON INSPECTION before packing, with the result that
not less than 26 to 80 per cent, are rejected. But I And
this season a firm has placed large orders, but ABSO-
LUTELY NO INSPECTION takes plaoe, consequently
makers are competing for the orders at lower rates on
these terms.
We take our friends behind the scenes so that
they may see WHAT A TRAGEDY the blind
trade is, and so that they may, when buying blinds,
discriminate between honest dealers and the other
sort. No doubt the blinds WHICH ARE
SHIPPED WITHOUT INSPECTION are
offered at lower prices than SELECTED BLINDS,
but wise people will prefer giving a trifle more,
should it be necessary, with the certainty of get-
ting BLINDS which offer some show of protec-
tion, and that do not tumble in pieces after a
fortnight’s wear.
BAMBOO BLINDS
made of the outside of skin or the bamboo in
its natural color. SPECIALLY SELECTED.
Fitted with CORDS and pulleys ready to put up.
It may be added that the CORDS are strong and
suitable, and not liable to rot and break on the
least provocation. Sizes from 3ft. wide by 6ft.
deep to 12ft. wide by Bft. deep ; prices, Is. to
ss. 6d. each blind.
CHINESE BLINDS
made of fine split bamboo, painted green on both
sides, and fitted with CORDS and pulleys of
best quality. These blinds are SPECIALLY
SELECTED. Sizes from 3ft. wide by 6ft. deep
to 12ft. wide by 10ft. deep ; prices from Is. Bd. to
7s. 6d. each blind.
BEAD AND REED BLINDS
Charming assortment of colors and styles. These
blinds are available for halls, doorways and win-
dows, They say they frighten the flies away. If
so, they are worth a pound an inch. Prices from
2s. 9d. to 15s.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The blood of Woman weak is on thy head,
The blood of Mother wronged, yet held accursed,
Thy head, O, Butcher-People, bloody red,
At paps of pale hypocrisy wet-nursed.
Her blood cries out to all the firmament
From shambles of a fierce Executive ;
The lees of lust may wallow in content,
Yet never learn to spell the word—Forgive.
For mercy cringing for its own pet sins,
Lust clutches helpless debtors by the throat,
Yet, “ Blood yells blood ! ’’ and ends as it begins,
Demanding payment to the final groat.
Nor meets a farthing of its own just debts,
Yet gloats on gallows and “ a sick’ning thud ” ;
With feelings Pharisaical, forgets
Its share in spilt infantieidal blood.
A maiden—nay, a child—of scarce fourteen,
Deflowered, ere yet her nature’s innocence
Can grasp the problem of the might-have-been !
Woe weights a motherhood past penitence.
See Mother Grundy’s skirts draw back at that!
See Christian sympathy grow coldly dull !
She, knapsacked with a noxious bastard brat,
Must eafn its suck as may a pavement trull.
Her ravisher may flaunt it with the Great!
May preach State scholars moral platitudes,
May “ smell his hat ” in kirk, hand round “the
plate,’’
And “lead in prayer ” in pious interludes ;
May visit “ Gu vmentouse,” “the mould of form,”
And smile on Bosomed Fashion as a boon.
She, overwhelmed by Icy Virtue’s storm,
Is euspidored—“ Sassiety’s ” spittoon !
Now rages battle’s tumult in her breast,
A fight so fierce it cannot long endure,
A war between the Mother, babe caressed,
And Woman, striving still to flee the sewer.
; The end was certain when the fight began ;
; Hell’s legions held a glad corroboree ;
( They knew that Icy Virtue’s moral plan
Swift murders Marriagelesss Maternity.
Next, see the Mother pleading with her kind
To lift the Knapsack off her weary back ;
Still see religious elements combined
To force her staggering along the track.
No hand of help ! A trull ! A bastard brat!
The grave alone gives rest, nor death too soon.
The grave ? There is deliverance in that !
See how inviting is the still lagoon.
A moment’s madness and a Murder done !
As simply done as Murder was before
When lechery the Child-Girl’s virtue won—
Choked out a life it never could restore.
Yet, when Humanity appealed for grace.
The Apoplectic Powers took no reck ;
“Thumbs down ” for blood ! —so judged, ne’er be
their case !
i They took Man’s Victim and they broke her
neck.
More merciful was She, in her wild deed
To her unwedlocked babe, than others showed,
Who called to power the Furies that decreed
Her life a forfeit to a Bloody Code.
The hour of death excels the hour of birth,
And bastardy ferments with bitter leaven;
At least She saved It from “ a hell on earth,”
And who dare say the pair are not in Heaven ?
Whose was,the Murder? Whose the Murders
twain ?
Spirit of Justice! name us. whose the guilt?
By cause of whom that baby bastard slain?
By whom was that Girl-Mother’s life-blood
spilt ?
Spirit of Cain ! rejoice thou in our Law,
Proclaim the shameless, bloody truth on oath—
The oath of Cam ! —the bloody truth and raw !
The murderers of one did murder both !
Thus Icy Virtue weds with bloody Cain—
That land is surely great and pure and free
Whose only Foundling Hospital a fane
In Murder’s Gave, hard-by the Gallows Tree.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “ Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes knoym as
“ THREE OJLSTLIBS 77 and “ COIF’S ZLA-ICT. 75
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade.. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Mills’ “Three Canties” and “ Capstan " Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE ” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes Iftlr

forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away bettor than anything he his

A British. Syndicate.
A few days ago it was cabled from England
that a chartered co. was in process of forma-
tion, under the auspices of Colonial Secretary
Chamberlain, with a view to taking over
the Northern Territory of Australia and
working it as a purely British speculation.
It says a lot for the blank indifference of the
Australian people upon great national ques-
tions that this stupendous announcement
appears so far to have excited no public
interest whatever. That small item of intel-
ligence told of, perhaps, the greatest danger
that has ever yet threatened Australia.
Nevertheless, Australia in general, being
busy over its great annual horse-carnival, and
over the Brassby reception and other show
items, has apparently not even inquired
about its authenticity.
* * *
The Northern Territory comprises one-
sixth part of this continent. Though not
yet thoroughly explored, it is well known
to be a rich country—rich in gold, silver,
copper, lead, coal and iron, and in pastoral
and agricultural land. So far, it remains
almost void of settlement, solely on account
of its inaccessibility. The railway to connect
it with Adelaide has not yet reached its
southernmost border ; the two great Queens-
land lines, which will ultimately connect
with it, are still many miles away from its
eastern frontier ; and Westralia hasn’t even
begun to make a railway towards it from the
west. Also, its principal seaport is an
immense distance by sea from anywhere.
It has been “temporarily ceded” to South
Australia, and all that has been done for it
has been at the expense of that province.
S.A. built its solitary railway line, 150 miles
in length, constructed its mads and tele-
graphs, supplied it with public schools, mail
services, police protection, law courts, par-
liamentary representation, and other alleged
adjuncts to civilisation, and has made up its
revenue deficiencies lo the amount of nearly
a million. Britain neither explored
the Territory, nor occupied it, nor
spent anything upon it, nor did any-
thing whatever to promote its ad-
vancement. Nevertheless, it remains on
paper a British possession, and Britain has
still a paper-right to assume the direct
ownership of it. No attempt was made
to exercise this right in the days when
the Territory was practically useless on
account of its utter isolation from the
outer world. But now that railways are
slowly approaching its borders, and
population is beginning to appear in the
adjacent regions of Westralia, and there is
•some prospect that the Territory will, before
very long, become a possession of colossal
value, the British claims seem to have sud-
denly revived, and the above-mentioned
syndicate is heard of for the first time.
• • •
The report may not be wholly true, but
even the rumor of such an aggression should
have stirred Australia to its foundations.
If the Territory is handed over, the first,
last and only object of the syndicate will be
to make money out of its possession. The
Government will consist of a board of direc-
tors in London. As the board will not live
in the country and will share none of its ills,
it will have no object whatever except to
establish and then grind down a servile
population, and make money. Even the
Boodlbwraith Ministry of Queensland and
the unspeakably bad Government of Wes-
tralia are restrained to some extent by the
fact that they live in the country, and, con-
sequently, don’t want to make it wholly un-
fit for a white man s occupation. Also, they
are restrained by the popular vote which has
to be reckoned with, no matter how the
electoral rolls may be manipulated. To the
syndicate it won’t matter what kind of a hell
the Territory may become, for it will be
16,000 miles away. It won’t be restrained
by popular suffrage, for there will be no
suffrage or Parliament or popular representa-
tion whatever. The syndicate will prac-
tically supply the law-courts, the police, the
executive, the Governor, the military
forces, and all the rest. It will be the
universal landlord and the beginning and
end of everything. Under these conditions
what kind of a Government it may supply
can be imagined, and there is practically no
kind of a Government which it may not
supply.
♦
The Territory, under syndicate rule, will
be a huge nigger and Chinese province with
a few white men to boss things, and keep
order, and collect revenue. Population must
be obtained to rent or buy the lands and
work the mines and make the great tropical
province a profitable speculation. The kind
that is wanted in such cases is one that is
servile, abundantly procurable, cheap, which
is accustomed to hard conditions and can
live in a sultry climate, or, if it doesn’t live
to any great extent, can die there peaceably
and without attracting much attention, and
be easily replaced. Also, it must be a popu-
lation which won’t write to the papers and
complain about the syndicate’s doings, or
clamor for a Parliament and a share in the
work of Government, or send ugly memorials
to the British authorities and distribute
copies thereof to the press, or otherwise
cause publicity and render itself objection-
able. In short, it must be nigger and
Chinese in race and instincts, for no other
kind that is easily obtainable would fit
in with the syndicate variety of government.
To fill the Territory with a white population
would utterly upset the arrangements ; such
a population would insist on all manner of
rights which would interfere with the profits
and deprive the syndicate of its control, and
presently of its ownership, of the country,
and if it was ruled according to the methods
of chartered companies the inevitable result
would be revolution. • Moreover, the re-
quired population—which must be procured
in a hurry in order to grind out the divi-
dends without delay—can’t be found in Aus-
tralia for a good many years to come,
and to import it from Europe at great
expense, when a cheaper and much more
suitable variety can be found close at hand
in Asia, would be sheer insanity from a
money-making point of view.
# • •
Then the syndicate’s cheap nigger-labor
and leprosy would begin to filter over the
borders into S.A. and Queensland and New
South Wales and Westralia. It could not
be kept out unless the adjacent provinces
were prepared to establish military pickets
over miles of the most desolate frontier
in Australia. Its arrival would be encour-
aged by all the squatters, sugar-planters,
farmers, mine-owners, and others who want
cheap labor—and their name is legion. It
would spread by degrees from the ever-
full reservoir of the Territory until
a cheap, servile, alien race had in-
vaded every labor - mart in Australia,
and heathenism, tribal wars, leprosy,
and Joss were everywhere, and a piebald
race began to grow up throughout the great
Piebald Land of Australia, The hope of
every good Australian is to keep this new
country for the white man, and avoid the
establishment here of the awful curse which
has descended on the Southern States of the
American Union, where the white man and
the black are at constant war, or the twin
curse which has fallen on some of the South
American republics, where the white man
and the black have intermingled until the
result is a mongrel race of no account, or
the still worse disaster of Hayti, where the
nigger and the half-breed and the Caucasian
are on top alternately, and the country is a
Bedlam. The syndicate, however, would be
troubled with no such considerations. Its
occupancy, in the natural order of things,
would only be temporary, for syndicate
government cannot last for ever under any
conditions. Its onl> object would be to
make money. It would in no way be con-
cerned with the social condition of its pro-
vince, for it would not live there. It would
care nothing what kind of a country it made
the Territory, or what kind of a country it
made Australia, for it would not be Austra-
lian and would have no shadow of interest
in Australia’s welfare. A Russian or French
or German or Japanese autocrat who came
to stay would have an interest in doing his
best for the country according to his lights.
The syndicate, which couldn’t stay per-
manently, would have absolutely none. It
would be the most soulless despotism on
earth—a company of purely foreign specu-
lators whose interest it would be to sell the
Territory piecemeal to all the scum of the
earth if it could make a profit thereby, and
then when the march of events made syndi-
cate government no longer possible—as it
always does sooner or later—leave the con-
sequences as an enduring curse upon Aus-
tralia.
• •
The Territory, when its English and
Hebrew and German and French and
mongrel owners got their scheme into full
blast, would be the Land of Cheap Labor
par excellence. It would consequently be a
land of cheap production, and it would com-
pete everywhere to advantage with the ex-
ports of white Australia. It would also, as
already mentioned, be the source from which
swarms of cheap nigger laborers would drift
into the white, or still comparatively white,
provinces. Its cheap nigger-made products
would cut out the white Australian in his
own markets, unless they were kept out by
a cast-iron Protective tariff. And if the
syndicate - governed province grew to
maturity it would probably object to this
treatment and demand concessions. In such
a case it might prove a formidable neighbor.
A State which doesn’t spend money on free
education and similar adjuncts of civilisation
—which is run on the beautiful Maxim-gun
principles of forcible occupation—and which
is bossed by an autocratic administrator in-
stead of by the divided councils of a Parlia-
ment, is always formidable if its forces
are well-directed. In the course of years,
with reasonable good fortune and with
great financial and political interests to sup-
port it at “ Home,” the syndicate which
ran the Northern Territory might become
almost as dangerous an enemy to provoke as
was the East India Company in former
times, or as the South African Company has
lately proved itself. Its existence would put
an end, for many years at least, to the pos-
sibility of an Australian Commonwealth, for
the syndicate would never join in a system
under which the Federal Parliament would
have power to prohibit nigger and Chinese
labor and to destroy its best sources of profit.
And it would put an end for ever to the
dream of a white Australia. Even if the
Territory did fall at last into the Federation
it would have to be taken over along with a
great alien population, which population
would inevitably claim the rights of citizen-
ship and demand a share in the political
control of this continent, and which couldn’t
by any possibility be sent back again to the
tea-fields and jungles of its fathers.

Great Britain has a paper claim to the
ownership of the Northern Territory. It
never did anything for that country ; it did
not settle it, nor open it up to commerce
and civilisation, nor spend any money upon
it, nor do anything whatever for its advance-
ment, and it made no claim upon it until
recent developments in the adjacent pro-
vinces opened up a prospect of its becoming,
at an early date, a much more valuable
possession than it has hitherto been. Yet it
has—on paper—an absolute right to do with
the Territory as it pleases : just the same
right as it has to establish an Inquisition
there, and convert the inhabitants to the
Anglican Church by boiling them in oil, if it
feels so disposed. And the Australian people
have a much greater right--one which doesn’t
exist on paper, and isn’t expressed on parch-
ment, but which is more enduring than any
other —to resist in one case as in the
other. All the empty forms of annexation
which were ever devised can give no
country a right to be an unspeakable
disaster to its neighbors for the benefit
of a gang of selfish speculators—and even if
they did it wouldn’t matter. If the Northern
Territory scheme takes definite shape, and
the Australian people do not resist it to the
uttermost, then they are not fit for national
existence and deserve anything that may
happen to them. There was never, in the
history of any British province, an aggression
which called more loudly for resistance to
the bitter end, and if the Australians endure
it they may safely be set down as a race
that is servile enough to endure anything.
Meanwhile, the danger is that South
Australia will let the matter pass
because the Territory is at present
only an unprofitable burden, and that the
Boodle Government in Queensland will view
it with complacency because the nigger-labor
and syndicate disease has eaten into its alleged
soul, and that New South Wales, Victoria and
Tasmania will be comparatively indifferent
because the danger is a long way off and the
Territory is to them practically an unknown
land. If they do they will only reap what
they have sown when the curse comes
home to them in after years. If the
scheme is a reality it is a danger a thou-
sand-fold greater than any other that
Australia has yet met with. If it is
merely a fiction intended to try the
temper of the community on the subject, it
is necessary to enter such a national protest
as will prevent any probability of the reality
coming along by-and-bye. In either case it
draws attention to the fact that the Ter-
ritory, under the present conditions, is a
standing danger, and until there is formed
a Federal Government strong enough to
insist on it being made an Australian pro-
vince, instead of a mere (anomalous fragment
of Britain, the real danger—even supposing
the present one should prove only imaginary
—may arrive at any moment.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Will You Walk Into My Treaty?
Therk is talk of a conference of Australasian
Cabinets to decide upon the action to be taken
in regard to the British-Japan ese-treaty signed
at London on 16th July, 1894. These provinces
are empowered by Article 19 of that treaty to
come under its provisions by giving notice to
the Japanese Government before Aug. 25, ’96.
And on 4tb Nov. a member of Brisbane Cham-
ber of Commerce moved :
That, in the opinion of this Chamber, the acceptance
by Australia of the treaty of 1894 would
develop commercial interests beneficial to the trade and
industries of each colony, promote friendship with a
treat Eastern power, and be a loyal and opportune
expression of the sentiment that British people, wherever
located, are part and parcel of one great empire.
Consideration of this motion was postponed,
but it was received with an approval which
other Chambers of Commerce would doubtless
share. As the ordinary commercial-man would
sell his own soul, if he had one, to gain a busi-
ness advantage, it seems sweet and honorable
to him to mortgage the souls of other people.
But it is worth while letting Australians under-
stand exactly on what terms Fat Man proposes
to coin their blood into drachmas. If any
Australian province agrees to come under the
provisions of the treaty it delivers itself,
bound hand and foot, to the Jap invader.
Says Article I.:—
The subjects of each of the two high contracting
parties shall ha full liberty to enter, travel, or reside in
any part of the dominions and possessions of the other
contracting party, and shall enjoy full and perfect pro-
tection for their persons and property.
The Jap will have precisely the same rights at
law as an Australian, “ ami enjoy all the rights
and privileges ” connected with the administra-
tion of justice “ enjoyed by native subjects.”
The Japs cannot be poll-taxed :
They shall not be compelled, under any pretext what-
ever, to pay any charges or taxes other or higher than
those that are, or may be, paid by native subjects.
The Japs are to have full freedom to deluge
this country with the products of factories
where from 3d. to 6d. a day is good pay for a
workman employed from 12 to 16 hours:
The subjects of each of the high-contracting parties may
trade in any part of the dominions and possessions of the
other by wholesale or retail in all kinds of produce, manu-
factures, or merchandise. . . . They shall have liberty
freely to come with their ships and cargoes to all places,
ports, and rivers . . . and shall enjoy, respectively,
the same treatment in matters of commerce and navigation
as native subjects.
Prohibitive duties must not be imposed on any
Japanese goods :
No other or higher duties shall be imposed on the im-
portation ... of any article . . . than on the
likeariicle produced or manufactured in any other foreign
countries.
In a word, the Jap, under the new treaty,
comes to Australia to stay and found Japanese
settlements. He must be given every right,
every privilege, which the native Australian
enjoys, and saddled with no penalty which is
not suffered by every white resident. He will
come in Jap-made ships, bringing an army of
Jap laborers to build Jap wharves and ware-
houses, and, discharge Jap goods. He will
build and work his own factories ; and the pro-
duct of those factories must be treated in
exactly the same way as the product of an Aus-
tralian factory ; and the white man who cannot
rear his family decently, after the fashion of
his country, on £1 a week, must submit to
absolutely open competition with the yellow
man whose family would be lapped in luxury
on =£l a month. If Australians consent to come
under the provisions of such a treaty, they are
bigger asses than The Bulletin takes them for.
Even a simple sheep does not hold up its
throat to the butcher and bleat to be killed.
But Australians are asked to deliberately pre-
sent to the knife the throat of their industries,
of their social organisation, of their children
and their race. They have all to lose and no-
thing to gain. What natural products—such
as wool and meat—Japan will take from us,
she will gladly take now, without any recipro-
cal treaty, simply because she needs them. The
only things we can takefrom her are the products
of a cheap labor with which it is hopeless for
white races to compete —products which will send
our children to the gutters, our women to the
streets, our men to the devil. And if a nation
with eyes in its head desires to see these things
come to pass at the bidding of the Trade-fetish,
and in order to fatten the paunches of huck-
sters, commission-agents, and middle-men, in
the Devil’s name let it.
A Legal Pooli Bah.
The present situation of Attorney-General
Want in the Dean conspiracy case is indeed
remarkable. The N.S. W. Attorney-General is
a species of three-headed animal—officially,
.that is—with occasional appearances as a four-
headed animal by w’ay of variety. It is he, in
the first place, who lays an information when
a prisoner is committed by the inferior Courts.
He is the Grand Jury, and decides whether or
not there is a case against the accused. Then
he prosecutes that individual, sometimes by
deputy, sometimes (as in the Dean case) per-
sonally, and demands his conviction with
impassioned rhetoric, and lays down his guilt
with a sickening thud before the jury. And,
when he is convicted, the same Attorney-
General, as an important member of the
Cabinet, is a very considerable element in the
Court of Appeal, and is called on to help in
deciding whether he was justified in laying the


Information to begin with, and whether he con-
ducted the prosecution fairly, and his evidence
was reliable, and whether he hadn’t been howl-
ing for the blood, or for the incarceration, of an
innocent man t Therefore, it naturally follows
that when the Attorney-General takes pro-
ceedings as a Grand Jury he must make a
great endeavor in his capacity as prose-
cutor to show that he did right in
his capacity as Grand Jury. And when
the case comes before him as a Court of
Appeal he must decide—if he is an ordinary
human being—that he did absolutely right in
his two capacities as Grand Jury and Crown
Prosecutor. And if the case comes before
Parliament on a final appeal he must argue and
vote, in his fourth capacity as a legislator, that
he did perfectly right in his other three
capacities, and bring all the weight of the
rascally party system to bear to make others
vote that way also. This is the Attorney-
General’s position at ordinary times, but in the
Dean conspiracy case Mr. Want has struck a
still more ridiculous and unfair attitude. For
this time only he, formally and in so many
words, abdicates his functions as a Grand Jury
in favor of the most wholly unfit man in all the
world —Mr. C. G. Heydon. (“If there is a
committal” —and there is—“ Mr. Want will
be guided entirely by what Mr. Heydon
advises.”) Mr. Heydon is unfit for the
one reason that he has acted as Crowii
Prosecutor in the case. In that capacity
he had to demand and plead and pray and
insist that Mr. Chick and the other accused
should he committed for trial, and to declare,
with a desperate earnestness of reiteration, that
there was a good case against them. Then, as
Grand Jury, he has to decide whether there is a
good case against them,andashe had to maintain,
as prosecutor, that there was such a case, there-
fore lie is the one man in all the world who
can’t possibly—unless he is more than human —-
be an unbiassed Grand Jury in this particu-
lar instance. By delegating his authority
to the only man whose position makes it almost
impossible for him to view the case dis-
passionately, Mr. Want makes the previous
unfair position even more unfair than it was
before. The moral of it all is that the Attorney-
General should be prosecutor only. His duties
as Grand Juror should be entrusted to other
hands, and he should be outside the Cabinet, so
that lie won’t sit as a court of appeal to judge
his own conduct. In the present position of
affairs every intelligent person in Australia, for
a variety of reasons, must deeply sympathise
with Mr. Crick.
The Unemployed.
Dear Bulletin, —The solemn fact, which
there is no good in glossing over, is that, of the
tens of thousands of impoverished men, young
and old, who have been hanging around Sydney
this last six or twelve mouths looking for jobs
or shifting sand at Centennial Park, not more
than a mere fraction are fit when called on for
a day’s hard competitive manual labor or a
day’s swift, skilful tradesman’s work. Master-
tailor Brown, say, wants a couple of men for a
hurried job, and informs Cheer’s bureau. Two
men are quickly in attendance and are given
needles. They were once decent craftsmen ;
but that was before they were driven to sleep out
o’ nights ; before they were drenched with rain
and pelted with wind ; before they pegged with
the pick and hoisted with the shovel, and tried
other precarious and unusual labor. Now their
hands are a-tremble, and Brown, after watch-
ing them for an hour, pays them off, and writes
a blistering letter to the inoffensive Greer,
who will show you lots of such scornful epistles.
Again, Ganger Smith wants half-a-dozen men
to complete a party to clear a site for a six-
storey warehouse, and Greer responds with
alacrity. But what can his six men do along-
side the regularly-employed and regularly-fed
pick-and-shovel men of the gang? They go at
the work with a will, but the indifferent diet
of the last six mouths soon gives them
away. The precarious shelter of windy and
rainy nights tells a tale, and presently
Ganger Smith yells, “Here, lads, go up and
get your money ; you won’t do I ” Gauger
.Smith is the voice of the merciless system
which demands a certain quantity of work per
man, and if lie doesn’t produce that, away goes
his employment. “ No tyranny is so grinding
as that of the poor man who is forced to oppress
the poor.” And as with the tailor and navvy,
so with the typesetter, the watchmaker, the
clerk, and most of the other unemployed.
These will never be absorbed by current pro-
cesses. Masters, to continue masters, must
reject such laborers. Current processes must,
therefore, be set aside or radically improved.
In the Dutch industrial settlements this feature
of the unemployed difficulty is carefully
studied. Weakened and emaciated men are
taken in and worked from grade to grade in the
settlements until in the end they are turned
out equal to the average of their craft. No
Government Bureau should offer to outside
employers workmen in the mental and bodily
condition of the great majority of the crowds
now seeking work. If the offer be accepted,
the master is a fool, or he intends to cut down
the regular rate of wages.—Yours, &c., X.Y.
The Real Gambling Evil.
Five or six years ago Melbourne had a sudden
ipasm of virtue, or snuffle, or something of the
sind, and the authorities proceeded to make a
dean sweep of the unlawful and dishonest
“totes.” It was a wonderfully clean sweep,
and for a whole week it was practically impos-
sible to find a working tote in all the boom-
stricken city. The better class of tote-keepers
—those who were moderately honest and so
didn’t realise enough out of the business to
make it worth their while to risk getting into
gaol—never came back, or at least very few of
them did, but the worse variety began to turn
up again a few weeks after that famous raid,
and have been there ever since. The
law never raised energy enough to make
another such clearance, and, moreover, the tote-
keepers, warned by that painful experience,
hired legal talent to pick large hole- m the
statute, and now by making their bets indoors,
and then taking the money on the pavement
outside—the pavement not being a “ fixed
place ” within the meaning of the Act—and by
other devices, they dodge the authorities effec-
tively. Melbourne now reeks and swarms with
fraudulent totes, and so does every other Aus-
tralian city, and the law is admittedly a poor,
impotent, busted thing which can do really
nothing to suppress the evil. It can sup-
press the honest consultations which had
a fixed address and gave everybody a fair
chance for his money, and the moderately
honest totes, and having done that it leaves
the hopelessly - fraudulent ones in posses-
sion of the field. The result is that they are
protected against their honest competitors.
This is not the result that was intended, but,
as it is the one actually arrived at, the Legisla-
ture might as well consider whether it is
not time to give up snuffle and deal with
things as they are. A country which raises
about two-fifths of its taxation out of grog
has no right to snuffle, anyhow. If the Aus-
tralian Governments licensed one or two men
of good character to run consultations in each
province, and made them deposit a handsome
sum with the Treasury as security, and
limited their profits to 10 per cent., one-third
or one-half of these profits to go to the State ;
and legalised the tote on similar lines ; they
would not make the gambling evil any worse
than it is, but the evil would be a lot cleaner
and more honest, and a good many hundreds of
greasy, bejewelled ruffians who now live by it
would be driven out of the business. Also, the
element of loafing and blasphemy and tobacco-
juice and stale whisky-breath which attends
the back-alley tote would be practically extin-
guished, and these things are sixty times more
demoralising than the gambling itself. The
tendency to lean surreptitiously on something
in an unkempt back-room, and curse and spit
and rub a greasy head against a dingy wall, is
the real curse ; the gambling itself is a wholly
casual and unimportant adjunct.
The Japanese Invasion.
Ed. Bulletin. -A few facts from one who lives
in a hot-bed of Asiatics may help to show Aus-
tralian workmen what they have to expect if the
new Japanese treaty is allowed to flood the
country with merry little brown men. I often
watch the Japs here at work, and frequently
employ them—simply because I must or go
without. I wanted a 6ft. Sin. x 2ft. Sin. x
lldn. deal door made—four panels moulded on
each side—O.G. 1J moulding. A Jap started
to make it by hand, had to rip and dress all the
deals by hand, and, with no one to help him,
had the door built in six hours, and well
finished off. He had to make the moulding.
The joints and mitre were well done ; the whole
was a very good door, and in my opinion made
in remarkably quick time. It was an imitation
of a Melb. machine-made door. The said Jap
is a quick and clever wood-turner, and I am
quite sure he could hold his own with a vast
number of Australians. I saw him turn 16 chair-
legs—by foot, and good pattern, I4in. turning
well done, clean and sharp edges, out of 2J x
'2\ cedar—in one hour. Put this to the average
wood-turner in Australia in a foot lathe, and
see where the Jap stands—an easy first. His
mate is a wheelwright, and he can build from
the rough two pair of four-foot wheels (known
in the trade as “ Ballarats ”) in six days of not
more than nine hours. He turns his nave,
segments his felloes, chops out his spokes (iron-
bark), mortices and bores by hand, and puts 14
spokes in—well-dressed, and pure imitation of
the English work. In this hot climate where’s
the Britisher who can sneer at this ? This man
is content to earn 20s. per week, and thinks
himself well paid. As laundry-men you can’t
beat the Japs, though they charge 4s. per dozen
pieces, large and small, and a pair of
socks counts two. As gardeners the Chinese are
an easy first, both in cultivation and product.
The Jap “ women ” (very numerous in Wes-
tralia) totally eclipse their white com-
petitors. They are particularly clean,
modest, sober, exceedingly polite, don’t
thieve, and look upon their calling in a
purely commercial sense. No white woman
can compete against those brown dots of
humanity. As shopkeepers the Japs are ex-
ceedingly polite and obliging—nothing is too
much trouble for them, and their stocks are
well selected and wonderfully cheap. As
tailors they are good, and even a Collins-st.
firm would not refuse to accept their work ; for
they can sew, cut truly, and perfectly. In
this line, however, they are not cheap, as the
material they sell is positively dear. They can
imitate anything—and go to work in a very
sensible manner —and their styles are an exact
copy of the English, or according to order. If
you ask a Jap his own opinion of his own goods
he will usually tell you approximately the
truth. In dealing I find them exceedingly
honest ; they can always pay up. Their living
—mostly dried vegetables and fish—costs a
trifle ; I positively assert that they are a more
formidable foe than the Chinese. They are
strong, game and ambitious, and co-operation
is their forte.— Cerhalos, Roebourne, W.A.
The Lost Selector.
Melbourne Age :
We cannot affiorU to forget that of the hundred thou-
sand odd selectors who have taken land in Victoria there
are only some 35,000 remaining on that land. The rest
have fallen victims to the mortgagee. The farming
business cannot pay 8, 10 or 12 per cent., and it has been
only a question of tune as to how long the land so encum-
bered takes to drift through the hands of the selector
into those of the mortgagee, and pass back into the pos-
session of the grazier as a freehold. There is no possi-
bility of denying the facts. Mr. Best has had some
very uncomfortable stories to tell Parliament on this
subject. In one instance a man held 32 selections,
having an area of 9275 acres, and bwing £3OO in rent.
This man was the mortgagee who got possession of the
land after it had been fenced, cleared and made ready
for cultivation. In another case a mortgagee got posses-
sion of 26 selections, covering 3539 acres, and owed £9Bl
in rent; another held 14 selections, comprising 3072
acres, and owed £913 in rent ; whilst another held 13
selections, embracing 2386 acres, and owed £735 in rent.
There was a long list, five mortgagees alone had driven
106 families off their holdings, had got possession of
23,634 aores, and owed the State £5323 in rent.
It is an acknowledged fact that the accumula-
tion of large estates in a few hands is an un-
mitigated evil. The following are four ways to
deal with it: (I) By the establishment of a
State Land Bank for the purpose of lending
money at low interest. The result will be that
the State will be the principal mortgagee, and
foreclosed properties will, to a great extent, fall
into its hands instead of into those of the private
Shylock ; (2) By a graduated land-tax, with
absolute exemption for the small owner, and a
steadily increasing impost for the large one until
the ownership of anything above, say, 10,000
acres of freehold will become a spec, that
will yield no profit whatever ; (3) By absolutely
prohibiting the ownership by any one indi-
vidual of more than a certain area. This law,
however, would probably be dodged so effec-
tually by the dummy system as to be of practi-
cally no account; (4) by an adaptation of
the French law of inheritance in a modified
form, it being enacted that any freehold estate
of more than, say, 2000 acres area or, say,
.£IO,OOO value, should be divided at the owner’s
death equally among his descendants. This
would be a painfully slow method of reform,
but it would get there in the course of a century
or two. But, for a community which wants to
tackle the evil now, the State Land Bank and
the graduated-tax—provided it is sufficiently
graduated—are the shortest and most efficient
ways out of the difficulty.
Government by Contradiction is beloved of the
Tories, and the spectacle is witnessed in Vic.
Assembly of a few stale and fulsome members
rising to complain that the Government is
giving them a tree hand in the discussion of
Government business. Is the mallee to be
occupied as freehold or leasehold ? The
Government bill provides for freehold, and the
anti-alienationists immediately join issue. A
Tory Government of the stubborn sort would
insist on the success of each clause being a
certificate of confidence in the Government,
and men would vote for freehold who believed
in leasehold, and men who didn’t care for either
would at the party-call be compelled to vote to
damn or save a Government. Voting by mob
is a feature of barbarism —the right of Demo-
cracy is not to merely say aye or no to some
Governmental accident—it is the right to
differentiate, to vote partly aye and partly no,
and partly neither. If mallee land is to be
selected for freehold, and Parliament agrees,
and then the Government proposes 640 acres
for selection, and the Opposition says 1000
acres, and an independent party says 320 acres
—it is still the right of any member to separate
himself from all these cabals, and vote for one
acre or acres. Government by Contra-
diction uags the individual, and hands over his
political soul to a political hell, where the
country’s interests are used for fuel; and the
Turner Government or the Reid Government
that bucks against this rotten system will get
honor and glory, even if personal flabbiness
and wobbling be the cause.
The Vic. Assembly has fooled away a consider-
able portion of the past five months in discuss-
ing a reduction of the existing duties on woollen
piece goods. The result of innumerable divi-
sions, “ rallies,” casting votes, and personal
explanations is a 10 per cent, reduction which
will operate from January 1, 1896. A further
fall of 5 per cent, is to happen two years later
if nothing occurs in the meantime to upset the
arrangement. Something will upset it, without
doubt. The time spent in maundering around
this bogus vision of the future has been utterly
and knowingly wasted. Next New Year’s Day
is somewhat close at hand, the present Assembly
may be expected to endure until then, and
the reduction of woollen duties to 30 per
cent, seems bound to come to pass. A
good few people in Victoria are looking
forward to the time when it will come to pass,
and expecting woollier coats and pants, or more
economical tailors’ bills from this particular
item of “Tariff Reform.” So many large
patriotic speeches have been spoken, so many
long leading articles written for and against
the 30 per cent, tariff, that it has come to be
regarded as a national blessing or a curse—one
or other of these things—as compared with a
duty pf 40 per cent. The Freetrade organ
calls it a step in the right direction, the Daily
Syme calls it a step in the wrong direction. To
the public it will make no difference at all.
The case of John Moloney, of Richmond,
Melb., as set forth in a petition presented to
Parliament, is a convincing sermon on the
Godliness of Thrift as applauded for years by
the resident Fat Man. John is over seventy,
has a crippled spine and a diseased hip, and is
a physical and financial ruin after giving Vic-
toria the labor of his hands for 50 years. In
the days of the boom Moloney owned £535
laboriously earned, and screwed together by a
due observance of the gospel according to the
paunchy Apostles of Thrift, but he listened
to the voice of the Boom Incarnate and in-
vested his all in paper banks and parchment
societies with enormous capitals in printers’
ink. In Moloney’s document “ your petitioner
prays ” that, inasmuch as he was beguiled to
throw his money into cracked banks and
bottomless financial institutions by seductive
and oleaginous M.’sP., Parliament will be
moved in its charity and wisdom to do some-
thing for him in his nfirmity and distress.
The public would have been delighted to have
been saddled with the keep of the boomers for
a few years, but they have no such hospitable
feelings for the boomers’ victims.
The New South Wales public is anxiously
waiting to hear some more about the Slattery-
Anderson dispute. Anderson says that Slat-
tery appointed as Inspectors of Agriculture—
apparently for political reasons—incompetent
persons, drunks, and utterly useless characters,
and appointed them at needlessly high salaries
and despite the strong remonstrances of the ex-
pert at the head of the department. The bur-
den of a Parliamentary document just issued is
that Slattery says he didn’t commit these acts,
and Anderson says again, with renewed
energy and much more ugly detail, that he did,
and Slattery says some more than he didn’t.
There is also some talk about a select committee
of the Assembly to inquire into the matter, but,
so far as the published correspondence goes, ex-
Minister Slattery doesn’t actually, and in so
many words, ask for this committee, neither
have any of his numerous friends in the Assem-
bly whooped up the Government in the matter.
Consequently, the very interesting question
about the appointment of O’Hooligan,
Maloney and 00. seems to be in danger of
dropping out of sight a good deah
New South Wales Speaker and Chairman of
Committees possess, singular to say, under
the present forms of the House, more drastio
and absolute power over members than is
possessed by either functionary in the Com-
mons. Take an unfortunately common inci-
dent as an illustration. When a member
offends and is obdurate in New South Wales
Assembly, the Speaker or Chairman simply has
him run into the street. In the Commons the
Speaker or Chairman “ names ” the offender.
Thereupon the Premier or, in his absence, the
leader of the House, moves that the offender be
suspended, and votes are actually counted. In
the last case reported, that of Dr. Tanner, the
division took place although Dr. Tanner could
not find a supporter to act with him as
teller. “ The ayes have it,” announced
the Speaker, and the doctor was marched
out. Why should a New South Wales
Speaker or Chairman possess greater power
than this? Then, again, in N.S. Wales, the
member so marched out is actually thrust into
the street. In the Commons, however, a first
suspension only excludes him from the legisla-
tive chamber. The galleries are open to him,
and so are the lobbies and smoking-rooms.
The practice is that a first suspension excludes
a member from the legislative chamber for one
week, a second in the same session for a fort-
night, while a third excludes him for a month
from Parliament and all its precincts. This
looks, and is, a mode of dealing with fractious
members far preferable to the N.S.W. style ;
and why, then, is the prize-fighter method of
pitching a man into the gutter continued ?
The suggested conference between the two
N.S.W. Houses on details of the Land and
Income-tax Bill will, if it takes place, serve to
prove the value of such conferences as a solution
of bicameral perplexities. What are called
details in this case amount almost to fixed prin-
ciples, and, in the Council as well as in the
Assembly, the best legislative abilities are
harnessed to opposing propositions, so that a
harmonious result here would set a precedent.
In Great Britain, the Upper and Lower Houses
have long since abandoned the idea of deter-
mining any difficulty by a conference. Con-
ferences are occasionally talked of there, but
those experienced in the methods and claims of
the two Houses in England contend that a con-
ference between them is impossible where the
subject-matter is of importance.
Dear Bulletin, —Maoriland certainly pays
attention to minor details in her Labor legisla-
tion. That is her finest virtue. Let Sydney
D.T.’s indignant Britisher remember that he is
himself a pettifogging detail. Australians
wrangle about big measures that never pass, or,
if they do pass, are quite inoperative ; Maori-
landers approve radical laws, fill in “ minor
details,” and make their legislation workable.
The only perceptible dissatisfaction with these
arrangements is evinced by the fat shopkeeper,
the hateful factory-sweater, and the haughty
British tourist. The M.L. Early-closing Act
is obnoxious to these people, which is
the best possible argument in its favor.
In M.L., the workwoman works 48 hours
a week in a clean, well-ventilated building,
sanitarily complete, where even a dining-
room must be set apart for her use. The work-
woman doesn’t grumble at this ; she rather
likes it. Contrast with one Sydney sweating
establishment where recently each female hand
had thre'e or four apprentices—absolute raw
material—and a painfully heavy standard of
work to make-up. Employees started at 8.30,
were allowed half-an-hour for dinner, and for
weeks slaved almost every night until 8,9, or
10 o’clock —male hands working even on Sun-
days—for the whole of which overtime ordinary
day-rates were paid ; whilst apprentices were
benevolently granted Id. per hour for extra
work. Workers in M.L. are not gluttonous
enough to pine for this state of things. The
Telegraph correspondent’s “dispensation”
assertion is ridiculously dishonest, and down to
■ the level of a pooah fellah who couldn’t pur-
chase cigahs ahfter 1 o’clock on Wednesday,
dem it all, in beastly, degraded Maoriland.—

The chaplain of Melb. gaol described the late
Emma Williams as a poor, ignorant creature
who had never had a chance to know or do the
right. Married at 14 years of age, she was a
mother at 15, and her husband knocked her
about. After she was brought to the gaol,
said her ghostly comforter, Emma Williams
gave herself up wholly to religion, and was
very grateful for its consolations. She went to
her death with resignation and a belief in the
Divine Mercy. Christianity, in fact, must
stand or fall by the assumption that Emma
Williams will be happy evermore, whilst any
other woman of her class, who shrinks from
murdering her offspring and is doomed to die
in an ordinary manner, must be damned for the
same period. Mrs. Besant’s creed seems to get a
good deal nearer to what ought to be the
terewth. This unfortunate criminal, says the
Theosophical Society, is born again, the child
of exceptionally cold-hearted, selfish parents,
and, perhaps, with a silver spoon in her
straight-cut mouth this time. Each attempt at
self-improvement in any one life is rewarded
with an easier chance of scoring in her next
innings, and so she goes working out her own
salvation. Deeming is working out his salva-
tion somewhere or other. Last time he was an
amorous plumber with a hankering after titular
distinction. the present moment he is a
real little lordling, as likely as not, or the babe
of a bloated brewer who has set his mind on
achieving a British beerage.
The flag of the barque Catalpa, in which

Class Taxation.
Thu cheap and shoddy Tories who assert that
tho graduated land-tax and tho absentee tax
have “ driven capital out ’* of S.A. and Maori-
land, and that the same driving-out process
must eventuate in N.S. Wales, are hereby in-
vited to consider tho case of dear old Britain.
In that country it is estimated that the land-
tax, local rates, tithes for the support of the
Established Church, income-tax (which is levied
on rents in addition to the tax on land), and
the succession duties, which are very heavy,
make up an average annual tax of Bs. 7d. per
acre on agricultural land. Agricultural laud is
very low down in the United Kingdom nowa-
days,* the Freetrade doctrine of the “ cheap
loaf” having reduced agriculture almost to
zero, and it is a common thing for all these
forms of taxation to swallow up 18s. in the £
of the net annual rental of country lands. It is
also by no means an unheard-of thing in parti-
cularly depressed localities for it to swallow up
all the rental. This is in the matter of bind
only, and altogether apart from the local taxa-
tion on house property. Then the Imperial
Government levies “ house duty ” in addition
to the Imperial land-tax and the local land
taxation ; also, it charges many other quaint
imposts, such as taxes on coats-of-arms, on
carriages, on the nominal capital of limited
liability companies, on fire-arms, house-agents,
on agreements for letting furnished houses at a
rent of more than £25 a year, on male servants,
gamekeepers, grocers, railway passengers, and
on a multitude of other persons and things. The
amount raised annually by imperial ami local
taxation in Great Britain is over £ 120,000,000,
or about =£3 2s. per head of the entire com-
munity'. This is, roughly speaking, about ss.
per head more than the amount levied in South
Australia, which, despite its graduated land-
tax and its income-tax, and other imposts
objectionable to the Fat Man’s soul, is the most
lightly-taxed province in Australasia. On the
other hand, it is less than the taxation in New
South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Tas-
mania, from none of which is it alleged that
capital has been “ driven about £2 less than
in Maoriland, where the total taxation equals
£5 per head ; and only about half that of Wes-
tralia, where it rises to nearly £6 per head,
despite which circumstance capital is flowing
in freely. But the really interesting circum-
stance is that nowhere in Australia is the
burden of taxation on agricultural lands,
houses, and incomes so heavy as it is in Great
Britain, therefore, if this kind of taxation is to
“ drive capital out” of Australia it would be
highly interesting to know why it doesn’t
iso drive it out of the “mother country.”
Jllso, when the local Fat Man complains
jf “ class taxation ” as a principle, he is
invited to consider the situation at ’Ome, the
place so dear to his Tory soul. There the
income - tax is Bd, in the £, and the
local taxation falls mainly on land, and
in addition the central Government raises
.£2,500,000 per annum by land and house
tax, and the estate, legacy and succession
duties on the property of the deceased Fab
Man ascend on a graduated principle to a
possible maximum of 18 per cent, of the total
property, and his investments are taxed in
every imaginable way while he is alive by
duties on bonds, debentures, the capital of
companies, the receipts of railway companies
from passenger-traffic, leases, conveyances, &c.,
and he is taxed on his house and his carriage,
and his coat-of-arms and his flunkey, and his
game keeper, aud his silver-plate, and his gun,
and many other of his gauds and luxuries.
Even the Maoriland Labor-party never carried
the principle of “ class-taxation ” further than
it has gone in dear old England ; all it has
done is to distribute the burden a little more
scientifically.
FiDiTOR Bulletin, —
Melbourne University’s Government subsidy now stands
at £9OOO endowment and £3250 annual vole.
What does the University do for this £12,250
per annum ? It imports a large and expensive
stall. Then it plans a time-table that will pre-
vent all but the children of the rich from
attending the professional lectures. It de-
teriorates from the ideal home of learning bo be
a mere training-ground for several professions—
law, theology, medicine, school-teaching, and
so forth. Nor is even this miserable function
well performed. The lectures are delivered
when the professor is well, and hasn’t got the
hump, and doesn’t want a holiday, and hasn’t
got business in the city. At lecture-time four
anaemic students appear and wait. If the pro-
fessor arrives (and he very often doesn’t) they
listen weakly and take obscure notes of a 10-
year-old lecture. Tbeu they go to another
lecture-room and give another professor the
chance to arrive, which very often he doesn't.
When it is thought probable that a new
lecture may be expected, some of the firms
who make money out of University shot t-
comings pay a trifle to some student
and be furnishes notes. These are repro-
duced with a jelly-pad, and smudgy
copies are sold at £3 3s. a set to
uudergrads who have too much sense to
cool their heels and sap their brains in the
lecture-halls, waiting for professors who so
often stay away. One professor recently
repudiated his lectures for a week, the
wretched students mustering as per table every
day. This is a typical case. The Univer-
sity needs radical reform or radical retrench-
ment. If it is to be part of the system of
State education, its time-table must not con-
tinue to operate against those who have to go
to their daily employment. Education at pre-
sent is degraded to be a stepping-stone to
certain polite trades ; though education for its
own sake is the real and reasonable object of n
university. And the door should be open to
the clever youth of the whole community, ami
not reserved for the gilded youth of Fat Man.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Lyceum “ One of Our Girls.”
Hhk Majesty's “ Robbery Under Anna
Tivoli Rickards’ Variety Cj.
Sydney Music Hall Variety Co.
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's Theatre “ The Gondoliers.”
Theatre Royal “Youth.”
Opera House Rickards’ Variety Co.
All the Sydney shows remain as described
last week, and for the present tMs column might
as well be closed for repairs. Meanwhile, one or
two changes are in prospect. “ Oal Kentucky,”
at the Lyceum, has decided to retire with the
dignity of a somewhat unappreciated spectacle,
and it is to be replaced on Saturday by Bronson
Howard’s comedy, “ One of Our Girls.” Which
of our girls it is is.not jet known, but The Bul-
letin can name the girl that it hopes it will be in
one try. B. Howard’s comedy has never before
been produced in Australia, and as Sydney hasn’t
seen a new comedj r for some time it should do
well, if it is anything litre up to its title.
** * *
“Robbery Under Arms” is living up to
the reputation which this paper gave it on the
opening night—as a financial success and a fine,
picturesque spectacle, with much gum-tree in it
and a very great deal of horse. Dampier’s mellow
voice is as musical as ever, and Alfred Woods’
aboriginal has lost none of his demoniac activity.
Woods’ aboriginal is an exhausting character ; all
through three long hours he is either arriving in
an impromptu fashion over a high gate, or else
departing at a furious run to see if the troopers
are coming—which they generally are —or else
racing aoross the stage on all fours in search of
“tracks.” Miss Julia Merton makes a particu-
larly clever old woman, though the said old woman
has no visible connection with the drama ; and
Mr. Watson’s Irish policeman calls for commenda-
tion as being every tiling that a serious-minded
real policeman should be. Several other persons
in a very long cast, who weren’t alluded to last
week, are hereby invited to consider themselves
mentioned in a more or less friendly spirit.
** * *
Afc the Tivoli, Hajek, the heavy-weight
man, continues to lift articles of considerable
tonnage in Ms usual mildly abstracted fashion, and
John Coleman has endeared himself to the great
soul of the public with sundry local songs—one
about a girl at Anthony Hordern’s being an
especial success. The yearning for “local
allusions ” is one of those things which can’t be
accounted for on any sane principle ; but the fact
remains that if a singer works in some remark
about a local drapery establishment he will bo
cheered till the roof is nearly blown off, while the
drapery shop itseif, is viewed by the same crowd in
a purely business light. James Harvey has returned
to this establishment, and his “imitations of well-
known actors ” are so remarkably good that anyone
but the actors themselves can recognise them at a
glance. No mummer ever knows how he looks on
the stage, and if he could get round to the front
and see himself from thee he wouldn’t know
himself from Sara Bernhardt.
** * *
George Leitch will shortly pack his big
spectacle in his carpet-bag for removal to some
other city. His vast panoramadrama is now
doing its last week at Sydney Royal, and whoever
wants to see the “Land of the Moa ” in all its
glory is advised to hurry up. The scenery in this
production shows all the really big thin-.s in
Maoriland except the public debt aud the female
anti-liquor movement, and the drama which
occasionally gets in front of the scenery is quite
as good as some other things this paper has seen
and survived.
** * *
Sydney Music Hall has held up its end of
the difficulty manfully through the second week
of its existence, but it still remains to be seen
whether there is sufficient room for the new ven-
ture. Meanwhile, tho murky Horace Bent < on-
titines to be the life and soul of the show, and his
burlesque, “Robbery Over A'ms,” is quite as
cheerful as burlesques umally are. Tho other
throe cullud gentlemen who make np the quar-
tette have not Horace's boundless energy, and
take life in a rather serious spirit, and a 'erious
burnt-cork person is an anomaly and a thing to bo
viewed with susp cion. Also, the small girl-artist
who sings about someone who had a pimple on
her nose wants to be suppressed wholly and en-
tirely, and removed bodily from the promises.
The fact that the song about that unimportant
skin-complaint is now in its second week is suf-
ficient explanation of this outbreak.
The photo, on this page represents Mr.
Scot Inglis, a young Australian actor, now of the
Lyceum Co., and also much remembered in Syd-
ney as the villain of many 10-ton productions at
Her Majesty’s, in the days when G. Rignold
occupied the limelight. Melodramatic villains
are all very much alike and afford little
scope, but Mr. Inglis made by far his
greatest hit in comedy. His representa-
tion of the ’umble but venomous clerk in the
“Bunch of Violets” was one of the best things
witnessed on the Sydney stage for some years, and
hisle hargic baronet, in the “Soap of Paper,”
was also a performance of .a very high order. In
Ins particular class of comedy, which doesn’t

require a display of frenzied energy, The Bulle-
tin reckons Scot Inglis about the best actor who
has been made in Australia for a good many
years, and the fact that he is now engaged prin-
cipally in pointing an empty gun at Granville
Blake is an example of misdirected ability.
** * *
George Rignold’s festive 1 season at Mel-
bourne Royal is progressing to the st'ains of a
vigorous brass band, whilst the British Flag leads
it on to glory. “ Youth,’’ last seen at the Ope'a
House in the days of a good while ago, was
reviv ed on Saturday, with George as the substan-
tial boy who goes astray. It is true th t he has
outgrown the name-part in a physical sense, but
in the matter of looking noble under difficulties,
and defying the wicked major to do his worst, the
only G. R. is quite as before, or more so. Mean-
while, Miss Kate Bishop has advanced to the
position of the hero’s mother, thereby strengthen-
ing one’s suspicion that the RRnold of to-day
must be tho sou of Ms fo mer self, who invariably
wooed and won the lady in question. Miss Bishop
is a specially comely and gentle stage-mother ; by
the way, also, Miss Maud Williamson is comely
without being gentle in the alluring guise of
an adventuress. Clifton Aldorson, the broguey
J. Sweeney and several other performers of vary-
ing capacity hold up the dialogue of this robust
production, when the story is not rendered in-
audible by cannons’ roars and shouts of British
triumph, and riotous music. At these times
dialogue would be very much de trap. “ Youth,”
as everybody kno*s, is mainly supported by im-
posing changes of scenery and large disciplined
bodies of auxiliary troops. And if everybody
doesn’t know it they had better hurry up and dis-
cover the historic fact for themselves, because the
days of the Rignoldian season are numbered, and
“ Youth,” alas ! is a fleeting dream.

“H.M.S. Pinafore,” at the Princess’s, re-
calls to mind an amateur, or chiefly amateur, per-
formance of the same opera on the same stage a
few months back. The unprofessional show was
not a much worse interpretation of Gilbert’s joke
than the present one. Some of the amateur act-
ing didn’t go far. but it was in most cases a fair
suggestion of the thing required, whereas the act-
ing of the W. and M. company goes a long way in
several w ong directions. Wallace Brownlow is,
in bearing and method, unlike the original Cap'ain
Corcoran selected by the author, (surgeon i/Hara
was born for the character). George Lauri lacks
the dryness and chippiness of a First Lord who
graduated in a lawyer’s office. Miss Elsie Cameron
is a gaudy Buttercup, instead of a calm, unctuous,
elderly bumboat w oman; and Miss Florence Young,
although a more suitable Josephine than Miss
Wray, is not a romantic, timid charmer. Miss
Young’s style inclines to aggressive now that i-he
has bcco ■ e an experienced, confident actress.
There'* noth'ng of “a humble captain's da gMci’ ”
abo it this Josephine, aud she wouldn’t dream
of eloping with an A.B. seaman. The veteran
Farley tas Dick Deadeyet and little Ivy
Scott are valuable additions to the company
under existing c rcu nstances, for they sing inter-
pointed songs and throw a veil eve “Pinafore”
traditions, so to speak. Miss Juliet Wray—who
has probably discarded the awful blue satin
costu i e in which she Jos-pinned as an amateur—
takes Miss Young's place for three nights this
week,

On Saturday the new tenor, Courtice
Pounds—or Mister C. P until the public a eon
familiar to ms w th him—makes his Australian
debut as Marco in “ The Gondoliers.” This isn’t
a very effective part to start with, but Mr. Pounds
played it in London and is said to get every pos-
sible ounce out of it.

The Oriental Carnival, after standing aside
for one day, to make room for another carnival.
has resumed operations on a rather vaster seals
of splendor than ever. The street in Jerusalem,
where the Hebrew maidens with largo lustrous
eyes and metal trimmings sell goods regardless of
expense, is about the liveliest thoroughfare on
record, especially in the evening when visitors
have lately been to the races and tho desire for
speculation is strong within them. Firework dis-
plays happen at the Carnival every evening, and
sundry side-shows, which cost sixpence extra at
the outset, have been sucked into tho groat vortex
of dissipation obtainable for one “bob.”

Be the Variety cu. at the Opera House,
‘here is nothing new and startling to remark,
except that Alice Teaman is coming along pre-
sently. The other Variety show, at the Caioty,
doesn’t seem to have anybody in particular coming
along not even to the front of the house. As for
the Alexandra, it has returned to its normal con-
dition of darkness and despair. When Charles
Holloway took possession of the premises, The
Bulletin warned him to expect the worst, and,
after six nights’ exper ence of what may happen
to a bad drama in the ill-fated Haltck, plain Bill’s
brother withdrew.

A Melh. paper parades the pattering, galvanic Bradfield
in a new light, as a critic of art and literature, lie has
strongly commended the work of a local black-and-white
artist; and he has unearthed a prodigy whose “parodies
lie intends to popularise in London by singing a number
of them." After hearing some of Bradfield’s topical
songs, Tub Bulletin believes that any verses which
receive his praise should be promptly removed to the
lazaret to prevent them spreading.
A drama founded on the Bible story of the Prodigal
Son was staged in Melh. in 1856, at the old Olympic,
better known as the Iron Pot, under George Coppiu’s
management.
Juliet Wray made a capital first attempt at playing
Beilina, in “ Mascotte,” the other night. Most of the
music, notably I lie Glou-Glou duet, is w ithin her reach.
Her acting, although crude and jerky compared with the
work of a Maggie Moore or Nellie Stewart, hears out Tub
Bulletin's first remark upon it—viz., that in parts where
natural vivacity and dash are the first essentials to suc-
cess Mi-s Juliet will fairly fill the bill. Gilbertiau heroines
are out of her line.
Juliet Flegeltaub Wray to a Smellbourne interviewer:
“ They say lam too thin in Sydney. Sydneyites like
fat people.” Not exactly, but they like the line of beauty
a little less defined.
An attempt to persuade themselves that they are only
gammoning to be mesmerised is evident in nearly all of
Kennedy’s paid subjects. Knowing what they will he
expected to do when under the influence, they try to
feel quite happy when the fat man tells them to stand
forward. After they have been made into lamentable
objects and brought round again they assume an air of
mental composure which must tickle Kennedy's fancy
immensely.
Mesmerist Kennedy got a well-deserved rebuke on
Derby night. A newly-discovered Melh. “ subject ’’ was
recalled to Ids proper self minus shoes and socks, and
with his feet and a portion of Ins pants in a bucket of
water. He demonstrated his disgust by emptying the
contents of the bucket upon Kennedy’s clean-boiled rag.
Toe bucket itself also followed the flying hypnotist, hut
it missed Ks mark—unfortunately.
“ Jersey Lily ” Langtry’s application for a divorce has
been granted by the American courts. On dit she now
will retire from the stage and live upon her means—esti-
mated at a quarter of a million sterling. Also, she in-
tends marrying a well-known Yankee railway-man.
F.: Bradfleid’s farewell verse—
“ We are leaving Victoria’s shore,
The kindest we’ve met,
We shall never forget,
For evermore,”
is “Poverty Pointed " as a painfnlly-weak gag, and so it
is—on paper. All gags are weak on paper. Mark Twain’s
first speech at Melh. journalists’ smoke-night was printed
in full in next day’s Age, and ttie general verdict was
“washy.” The joke about sheep in that speech was
reckoned more “ washy ’’ than the rest ; hut the dozens
of professional critics present at its delivery would have
cenified at the moment that it w-as ahso.utelv the best
joke ever conceived in this or any world. “When Dow
left his sheep-run it was a blessing to humanity—(.loud
laughter)—and to the sheep. (Sustained laughter).”
The cleverest landscape painting is rubbish if the atmo-
sphere he left out. The atmosphere of Twain’s gag was
his voice, his celelnity, Ids genius, Ids hair, and 1000
other things. Similarly, Bradfleid’s farewell, ungramma-
tical gag is nothing without its atmosphere—which con-
sisted of a catchy tune, a crowded house bursting with
heat, enthusiasm, and desire for flattery, a considerable
number of legs, &c. It was neither rondeau, villauelle,
nor triolet—it was a gag.
Juliet Wray is 21 this month.
This year’s racing-winner among Melh. Thespians is

A PUZZLE.
Readers of The Bulletin in the country are often
puzzled to know where to send their orders, so
many drapery firms are advertising what they can
do, but few care much how orders are executed.
There seems to be a general idea that “anything
will do for the bush,” all forgetful of the fact that
ladies, even in the remotest backblocks, like to
have the latest styles and the freshest of goods.
Messrs. Riley Brothers, of 570 George-st., Sydney,
have for the past 30 years given special attention
to their Country Order Department, and know
intimately the requirements of every part of the
colony—North, South, or West. If the lady
readers of The Bulletin will look at this corner
of the paper every week they will see what we are
sending away every day. Gentlemen will find
articles for them in the corner of another page.

Melbourne,
November 12, 1895.
My Dear Moorabinda—
Melbourne Cup is one of the few functions
which may be talked about a week after it s over,
the reason being that Cup styles are not for a day
only, but show how women are going to look ail
the summer. Judging by tlie Cup, the hue ol the
magpie will have it all its own piebald way for it
was as I pronliesied it would be months ago when
I saw Grace’ Palotta’s black-and-white dress in
“Joe”—a black-and-white Cup. The styles
were “ artistic ’’—immense, floppy sleeves, full
skirts, long gloves, and unspeakable headgear, in
which every flower blossomed but violets, which
are tabu, though roses were the principal wear.
Taking it by and lai'ge, it was a tastefully-dressed
Cup, and one of the most successful. Tlie crowd
was enormous, and partly hid the tact that Flem-
ington lawn was not so green as last year, owing
to the drought, though the flowers were in great
fettle and all the arrangements quite perfect. Mr.
Byron Moore has added perfume to the well-
appointed retiring-room for ladies, and the supply
of pearl-powder therein shows that the V.R.C.
secretary knows a tiling or two. And it isn t
the Cup girl’s fault if every man Jack isn t also in
the secret as to where our peachy bloom comes
from. To see women assiduously powdering their
noses while men look on enraptured trom the door-
way is quite one of tlie Cup sights.
The vice-regal party presented a butterfly
appearance. Lady massey wore ivory-white silk
mingled with porcelain-blue and embroidered
white chiffon, pink and white bonnet; Mrs. Free-
man Thomas (who is the beauty of the V.R.
group) looked ethereal in pale-pink and green
covered with muslin and an airy toque; Lady
Maud Warrender wore mauve with a covering
(everything is covered nowadays, like unused
drawing-room furniture) of creamy, lacey stud;
hat in black, pink and green. Miss Kitty Dailey
wore blue and white stripes and a white hat, and
another V.R. vjsi tress was unspeakably airy in
white and green. Present fashions don’t look
warranted to stay. A good shower on Cup-day
would have reduced most of the gauzey belles to
mere parti-colored pulp. Tlie appearance ot some
of the vice-regal men was amusing : one wore
corsets, which gave him quite an hour-glass out-
line ; another, in a blue shirt, white collar, check
tie, yellow vest, and red bandanna handkerchief
hanging half out of his breast pocket, suggested a
music-hall artist who sings a razzle-dazzle lay. I
am not disposed to say kind things about the Cup
men from a sartorial standpoint. One youth wore
a blue shirt with no starch in the hnzzum and a
bunch of valley lilies to call attention to it; and
most of the headgear suggested “ where did he
get that hat ? ” Fortunately, men were in the
minority —fittingly enough, Auraria’s Cup was
crowded with women.
The absence of the fat woman in the favorite s
colors made doing the lawn a restful optical
experience, and people who sinned sartorially
erred more on the side of snuffiness than over-
gorgeousness. A Sydney society spinster with a
marsupial nick-name was an awful example m a
gown the color of a barrel of ashes, but her sister
in a black skirt and blouse shot in blue, pink, and
green, and Gaiety toque of many colors, was up-
to-date. Miss Marcia Cox, in pearl grey silk,
with a hairline of. black-pink velvet cuffs and
collar with rows of Valenciennes lace, black beef-
eater bat, trimmed with pink ribbons and black
wings, looked very smart, but was swamped by
her chaperone—Lady Clarke —whose confection
of oosmea-piuk ribbon brocade, with white chiffon
bodice elaborately adorned with silvery passe-
menterie, and gay little bonnet modishly unmatch-
ing, was quite tlie most stylish turn-out on the
lawn. Mrs. Rupert Carington encored the pink
gown she wore during the A. J.O. Spring Meeting.
Melbourne’s particular beauty wore a black skirt
with a floral-silk blouse.
The most refreshing group on the lawn was four
maidens gowned in the frilly, fluffy, skirt-
dancing style in which an enterprising girl might
point her toe at the grand-stand without going
against the grain of her toilet. Two of these
damsels wore salad-green, and two white, and it
was as good as a sea-breeze to meet them, they
looked so fresh. One or two tailor-made damsels
looked as if their Cup dresses hadn’t got home in
time; and a widow, in all the show of deep mourn-
ing and a widdy’s bonnet—a widdy just begin-
ning to “take notice,” judging by the white
ruffles at her wrist—did the lawn assiduously,
although, judging by the freshness of her crape, ,
the late-lamented must have been a very recent
corpse. How considerate of him to go and die
just in time for bis disconsolate relict to sport her
becoming weepers (ber “To Let” advt., as it were)
at tbe Cup ! The fat woman turned up in white
muslin with a blue spot, and rainbow ribbons
down her balloon sleeves; and another welter-
weight sported bright Reckitt’s blue, with a bold
white pattern, as if she were in training to be a
dinner-service. Tlie most glaring costume was
worn by a Sydney society-matron, who mingled
Coolgardie yellow, prickly-pear, magenta, and
pantomime trimmings of silver in a highly fashion-
able but inartistic way.
There was a good show of he-Sydneyites, like-
wise Brisbaneites at the Cup, but I don’t
intend to catalogue them, for Heaven knows
bow many happy homes might thereby be
wrecked. Many a devoted husband, who was
supposed to he in quite the ,opposite direc-
tion, was doubtless on Flemington lawn. I saw
a dozen grass-widowers in as many minutes—
one had a perfect screamer in tow, with golden
hair (that the merest jerk would have sent hang-
ing down her back) and a most expensive com-
plexion. I wouldn’t name for the world a grey-
headed youth, who saw the Cup leaning upon a
presentation umbrella, with an inscription on the
handle, “Presented to Dash Blank, Esq., by the
members of the Christian Endeavour Society,” or
words to that effect. By the way, the Sydney
youth who married a Gee Gee was visible at tlie
Cup—bis Gride wearing a black gOwn with a pom-
padour pink fichu, and her hair apparently hang-
ing on one hairpin under her romantic hat. But
the most noticeable men on Cup-day were two
higb-cliuroli parsons, who ostentatiously had cham-
pagne for lunch.
I think the V.R.C. authorities ought to insist
upon their lady visitors going through some sort
of umbrella - drill before they allow them to
promenade on the lawn or the crowded asphalt—
for fevv women are to be trusted with parasols in
a Cup crowd without endangering a great deal of
millinery, not to speak of false fronts. I saw one
poor woman hooked on either side like a shark,
and everybody’s hat was screw-wrenched during
the day by women with unmanageable gamps.
One victim had her toupe pulled slantwise and
had to beat a retreat, and the reckless way the
parasol brigade carried on was a constant menace
to millinery. And, apropos of umbrellas, scarlet
would seem to be out of fashion, the modish
bright colors being magenta —which casts a flat-
tering light on a pale complexion, but should be
avoided by the woman with a boiled prickly-pear
cheek —and butter-yellow, from which the bilious
would do we'l to refrain.
A very “ best seconds ” sort of crowd turned up
to tbe first Brassey garden-party at Melb. Guv-
mentouse. Like gleanings on an olive-tree w§re
the fashionable folk, for tlie gowns to be admired
had nearly all debuted at the Cup. Lady Brassey
wore her Cup array, which was a refreshing cir-
cumstance to be remembered by many a house-
father, giving the lie economic as it di*d to the
rumor that Lady Brass* y never wore the same
gown twice. Paint and powder are religiously
eschewed by Melb. vice-regal ladies ; and another
pleasant circumstance is that there is an embargo
on kissing vice-regal infants, for nobody was
allowed to slobber over the small Helen, though
several matrons had to hold themselves back with
both hands. It is well that Guvmentouse puts its
foot on baby-hugging—it will make it unfashion-
able, and so relieve many a child-hater from having
to pick out a clean spot on the flabby cheek of
Budge or Toddie.
The pictorial effect of the Garden Party was
rather spoilt by the plethora of strange youths in
office suits and straw hats. The women, of course,
were gaily caparisoned. Melbourne’s belle looked
very well in a very uncommon and dainty dress of
white and black ; Lady Brassey’s double sported
green witli a white-dot chiffon bodice with
jet ornaments; but the world is aweary of smoothly
bevelled rags, and there was more amusement in
the overdone brigade, beginning with a bright
yellow girl with a trickling sort of figure who sug-
gested tlie first stage of Welsh rarebit, and on I m i nat-
ing in a short fat woman, the shape of a Chinese
ohest-of-drawers, who was attired in pea-green
with purple gloves. Stained glass looked aiiSßinio
beside her.
The appearance of Lady Brassey wheeling
briskly along on her bike, attired in a neat brown
skirt costume and small brown hat, has no doubt
emboldened the leading Melbourne bicycle-club
to forbid lady members of the club from attending
the club runs in knickerbockers, as “other ladies
object to meeting such women.” So, thank
Heaven, it lias been definitely decided that cycling
damsels may only wear breeches en famille round
the front garden, and that a member found bifur-
cating in a public thoroughfare will be struck
off the rolls. Which excellent resolution will
not cleanse the Melbourne streets of all the
gridiron girls in knickerbockers (frequently of
home-made cut and lumpy to look upon), for all
the wheel women don’t belong to the Cyclists’
Union ; but, henceforth, when you meet a bifur-
cated damsel in Melbourne, you will know just
where she comes in bicycling social circles.
And apropos of New Women—it will probably
turn some of’em green with envy to learn that
baritone Brownlow is accredited with having 21
pairs of trousers.
The Gee-Gees tilled openly at parsondom. In
the first play it was frankly described as “dull,
but respectable in the second, tlie buffoon of the
piece was a parson ; in (he third, the whole of the
second part was almost given over to showing what
a waste of money the charity bazaar leads-to, and
how some of the money never gets as far as it is
expected to. But charity really dues begin at
home in very many instances —begins and ends
there, in fact. lam thinking now of a suburban
five-siiilling hop recently got up to aid the starv-
ing poor, or some such deserving folk. It had
been an unparalleled success in cheap manage-
ment —almost everything had been a free gift—
but when the committee’s little “working exes”
were handed in they came to just over £25.
After all, women are not so easily frightened,
or else the recent cable-train accident, which re-
sulted in a young lady, who was riding on the
dummy, being crushed to death by a cart, would
have cleared all the girls off into a safer carriage
for a time, at least. But you see them tilting
along as usual, insensible to the danger of dummy-
riding in the narrow and congested Sydney streets.
It is really dangerous for women to ride outside
on a cable-car (it’s not so bad for more athletic and
rationally-dressed man, who can jump off or over
more easily), and the chance you run of having a
horse’s heels in your face or a cab sitting in your
lapis too obvious to make a dummy-ride down
King-st. a special treat. The carter, who was the
alleged cause of the death referred to above, has
been committed for manslaughter on a charge of
“negligent driving,” but the driver wouldn’t
always be to blame.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent :
“ Affairs on board the Sunbeam were conducted
on ‘ Bab Ballad ’ lines. : Baron Brassey models
himself on the famous Capt. Reece, of the Mantel-
piece, whose kindness to his crew has become
classic. As soon as the Sunbeam readied port
the Governor fitted out six of bis sailors for a
fortnight’s cycling expedition into the country :
he hired the bikes and supplied coin for expenses.
On his first appearance in a Melb. theatre, the
new Gov., seeing his crew in the amphitheatre,
looked up and nodded genially to them.
“Now that the Gaiety girls are gone, one can
tell how a moonstruck Melb, youth wasted his
substance in champagne suppers, ostrich-feather
fans, &c., to gain favor in the sight of the alleged
maidens, and how the maidens enjoyed the gifts,
but laughed at the lovelorn loon ; also, of how be
sent his photo., in a silver-beaten frame, to one
damsel, who cut the picture out and returned it to
the donor, but kept the frame! Woman always
keeps the frame.
“ According to a darksome rumor a winsome
theatrical visitor has found that the charms of a
wealthy Australian appeal to tier more strongly
than the constant devotion of her English johnnie,
to whom she lias been betrothed for some time.
So johnnie has been * sacked,’ and Melb. girfs now
bewail the capture of one of the few rich local
partis.
“ For fear they should tumble over each other’s
swords and come to blows, the Brassey aidekongs
have allotted themselves specific functions.
Shaftesbury is to be the official attendant on
H.E., and will swagger by ids side when he opens
and closes Parliament, &c.; Freeman Thomas is
to be pa-in-law’s social master of the ceremonies ;
and the limp Lord Richard Neville is to generally
hang round and be ornamental. Wallington is to
be taught his place as private secretary—and no
frills.
“The enthusiasm of the Melb. crowd, who
chased Lady Brassey when she went shopping,
evoked scant sympathy from the vice-regal
lackeys. One diminutive buttons, in particular,
standing on his perch, with his small nose turned
up to its very utmost in disdain at the ‘ owdacious
behaviour of those horrid kerlonials,’ presented the
most overwhelming example of offended dignity
ever seen in Bourke-street.
“Gov. Brassey, if they ask him prettily, will
lend a selection of his pictures to the Melb. Art
Gallery for a season. But not just yet.
“ People noticed at Gov. Brassey’s first ball)
that H.E. greeted his guests with ‘ a sailor’s
grip ’ in place of the artificial and almost insulting
elevated-pump-handle shake of the Hopetoun
regime.
“ That wily showman, Capt. Wallington, mani-
pulates his vice-regal puppets with ever-increasing
skill. Thanks to his tuition, the Brasseys faced
their first Cup crowd strong in the consciousness
of sartorial gilt and spangles, and with a reper-
toire so rich in nods, becks, and wreathed smiles
as to suggest thorough rehearsal. Successful as
was his pupils’ Flemington debut, however, the
canny entrepreneur saw the races through a mist
of ambitions musings. Fired by the effect of that
threadbare-popularity device, the vice-regal march
from carriage to Governor’s box amidst slow
music and hat-drill, he yearned to administer a
double dose of the loyalty stimulant. The
result was seen at the vice-regal ball, when
the opening ceremony took the form of a
triumphal procession through the ranks of the
awe-struck guests, “up the middle and down
again.” The array, which included the whole
house-party, small-fry no less than big-wigs,
marched in Noah’s Ark formation, though,
unlike the pioneer geologist, Sec. Walling-
ton had decreed the separation of the sexes,
except in the case of Gov. and Lady Brassey,
who walked together. On the strength of the
alleged ‘pleased with a rattle, tickled with a
straw’ propensities of Melb. society, orders had
been issued for full war-paint. Nevertheless, the
1200 loyal invitation-holders took the patriotic
pageant pretty calmly, though there were specta-
tors who gazed lowly and reverently even upon
the dapper aides, mincing along arm-in-arm.
“ At the Cup, the inmates of the vice-regal box,
women as well as men, rose automatically to
their feet whenever Lady Brassey entered the
portals; but apart from this air of discipline
the Gov. House party, especially the ladies,
looked happier than in the days when the
sporting Countess, oblivions of ber kind,
sat watching the races till her eyes stuck to her
field-glasses. Mrs. Freeman Thomas, a gny little
brunette witli the “gift of the gab” like her
mother, the first Lady Brassey, was responsible
for a good deal of stir, and, at the moment of
departure, ran down the line of carriages to take
her place in the last on the list, with no more
dignity than was convenient. Low, broad head-
gear requires the hair to be “spread ” at the back
to correspond, instead of tapering to a point or
“tea-pot handle,” according to present Melb.
methods, so both the Brassey women affected a
promiscuous siyle of coiffure, little.—“sausage-
rolls’’ and “snail shells” scattered inconseqnently
here, there and everywhere, all over the back of
tile bead.
“So far as the new suite is concerned, Lord
Richard Neville is unanimously pronounced the
pick of the basket. Unlike young Shaftesbury,
whom Melb. maidens promptly classified as “a
big good-natured boy,” unduly addicted to an old
grey coat and shepherd’s plaid tie, Ids colleague is
recognised as a genuine johnnie with all the latest
improvements, such as white gloves at the races.

One prominent Yic. Justice frequently
pares his nails while listening to arguments of
counsel. “He apparently thinks he has the law

Tbe portrait of ex-Premier Parkes and bis
new bride which appears in another part of this
issue is reproduced from a photo, by Freeman and
Co., of 318 George-street, Sydney. The original
is a fine and most characteristic portrait of the
ancient politician. Freeman and Co.’s work is
the perfection of high-art photography, and in
delicacy of treatment, accuracy and finish this
firm has absolutely no superior.
The Melbourne official doctors would not
certify, in so many words, that Mrs. Williams,
hanged last week, was not pregnant; they would
only say that in their opinion such was not the
case. All doubts in the matter are said by Hr.
Shields to have been removed by tbe post-mortem,
which clearly proved that the woman was not
pregnant. How ever, the guarded way in which
the ante-mortem medical opinions were expressed
support the opinion held by many people, that
where an absolute and unqualified assurance can-
not be given in such a matter the life of the woman
should be spared.
Under all tbe circumstances, it is most
inexpedient that the Dean alleged-conspiracy case
should be tried before any N.S.W. Judge.
Reasons which easily suggest themselves render
it highly desirable that nobody mixed up, how-
ever indirectly, with any of the eases which have
recently caused so much debate should hold the
balance between the Crown (i.e., the official
lawyers) and the accused. There is a strong
Queensland precedent for borrowing a Judge to
adjudicate in the matter.
In lhe foremost rank of colonial Premiers is Mr. Reid,
of N.S.W. To look a greater fool than he is seems to he
one of his dearest wishes, and he enjoys the reputation of
being the lean ideal of a “Piccadilly Johnnie.” He ia
fond of theatre-going, and Ids eyeglass an<; , eneraliy fop-
pish exterior enable the audience to dislir. uish him at
once.
“Another instance of Mr. G. H. Reid’s cnu ing for
the unattainable,” at once snarls ( lie cynic. Here
is some more about G.H.R. up to date. He is
laying on flesh by the pound, and must have
gained 201 b. since taking to the Premiership,
Which growth is attributed by some people to his
infantile love of sweets. It is said that up to a
few years ago he would walk a mile to buy toffee.
The death of a nonagenarian spinster*
Miss Moore, at Sale (Gippsland, Vic.), last week-
was announced along with the deeply-buried in,
telligence that she was own sister to a past N.S,
Wales Attorney-General. Probably, not a soul
outside of the relatives of the recently-deceased
spinster remembers Attorney-General Moore (he
flourished as far back as 182(1), who left no foot-
prints on the sands of Cornstalkian time. Mr.
Moore is more completely forgotten his
sister, who, half a-centnry ago, kept a girls’ school
in Lyons-terrace, Sydney, and most of whose
pupils have since married the worms.
Sweet singer Fitz Gibbon, the Melb. Sewer
King, had a violent eruption of loyalty on the
arrival of the Brasseys. It took the form of poetry

Thank Heaven the Brasseys have brains enough
to feei this kin I,of stuff rather keenly.
The N.S.W. Minister of alleged Justice,
when asked whether it was true that between
Rofe’s conviction and sentence his counsel had a
private interview with the Judge, and, if so,
whether it was customary forjudges, while con-
sidering sentence, to grant interviews to the
defending counsel of convicted persons, re-
plied that he declined to make any inquiries
into an innuendo made against a Judge.
If, he added, any member had a charge against a
Judge, he should submit it in the proper way (i.e.,
by specific motion). Considering how the Ministry
of which Mr. Gould is a member has blocked the
discussion of member Price’s specific motion against
Judge Windeyer, attorney Gould certainly takes
the belt for impudence. Another thing : it would
have been easy and proper for Minister Gould to
say (if he could say it) : “Prisoner’s counsel did
not privately interview the Judge after conviction
and before sentence.” The adjournment of. the
House should certainly be moved in this matter,
the arrogance of official lawyerdom having reached
an unbearable pitch.
A sunbeam that glanced o’er the waters blue
Has brought light and life and loveliness too—
The light of resolve to dispel dull gloom,
And glad prosperity place in its room.
With a kindly heart and an able hand,
And wisdom extracted from sea and land,
United with loveliness, chami, and grace
To stand in our Sovereign Lady’s place.

What is that long, low murmur that we
hear in Botany Bay? It is the members of the
official-legal ring whispering to one another.
And what are those piercing yells ? Those
are the yells of the Goddess of Justice, whom the

Even a rudimentary sense of justice sug-
gests that the Public Treasury should, in some
way, acknowledge responsibilities not only to
Mrs. Butler, but to other less sensationally-
wronged victims of blundering or blunderingly-
administered laws. The dogma that “ the State
can do no wrong ” is as dead as the dodo for the
present generation; and when the State is found
guilty of having assaulted innocent men or women
and damaged them by casting them into gaol or
scandalising their characters, it should be com-
pelled to pay over a sum of money in compen-
sation, just as any other aggressor is. In addition
to making for justice, this acknowledgment of
responsibility by the State might tend to curb the
precipitancy of Judges and stimulate the intellect
of jurors.

The Queensland Boodle Government had
an idea the other day. There has been much
trouble with the mild and reliable Kanaka around
Bundaberg; a few whites have been killed, and
mangled after death for pure cussednesa, and
women have been insulted and outraged, and
there have tribal fights with cane-knives and
hoes and clubs and the like, and other annoy-
ances. So the authorities invited the local
planters to send all their hard cases into Bunda-

oerg on a certain day, and in response a squad of
beetle-browed niggers rolled up with murder in

peal Bumble harangued this scowling mass of
B avagedom in pidgin English, and urged its com-
ponent parts to be better niggers in future and
“ no killee some more white man,” or words to
that effect. If they did the big white fellow
Government would be very cross indeed. Then
each possible black homicide received a drink of

senile decay of the Government which tries to
tame a howling, bloodshot Polynesian with a
bun ! As well endeavor to soothe the Inquisition
with an acid-drop.
The same week sundry of the bun and ginger-

man. The following is a sample of the evidence
(given by “ a Sunday-school teacher ”): —

This year’s Melbourne Cup was a com-
paratively dry and dusty function. Writer, who
“did ” the lawn, and hill, and flat, saw only 11
drunks —six of them females. The most sensa-
tional spectacle of the day was provided by three
girls, all apparently under 16, sitting in a seclude
part of the flat, drinking bottled beer from the
original bottles, and all exuberantly “squiffy.”
On the lawn, clothes-horse was a greater favorite
than ever, and was easily first all day. In fact, so
far as the lawn is concerned, the Cup is rapidly
becoming an event of no importance whatever,
and the first Tuesday in Nov. will presently be
remarkable, from the point of view of the lawn-
frequenters, only as the day of the great annual
dress-parade, when half the women of Melbourne
advertise all they owe to their dressmakers.
To the Melbourne shop-girl Cup Day is now
what the Church anniversary day is to her little
sister in the country—an oecason for a big sartorial
burst. She saves up through the previous 12

They are praying for rain in Adelaide
now, to the S. A. Joss. It is debated whether
the N.S.W, Joss can make rain inland, but cer-
tainly he is no use over the border. Evidently,
every province has its own providential rain-
maker. Federation of all the Josses, so that one
set of prayers will move the lot, is badly needed.
Just now there is a great waste of pious effort.

“Yes, father was connected with Mr.
Nolan’s church,” said the daughter of the poor,
hard-up, bailiff-tortured ex-soldier, who made a
sensation at North Sydney (North Sydney again !)
last week by cutting his own and his wife’s throat.
“We had prayers each morning. Father was
very good to the church, and taught a Bible-class
at the lecture-hall, where the Wesleyan classes
meet.” My son, paste this in your hat : The
road to mania lies through the gate of sincere,
religion. The imitation pietists—the sugar-sand-
ing grocer, the plate-passing elder who absconds
with the savings of the widow and orphan, these
are mentally as tough as leather. But the fervent
believer with the narrow head, and the protruding
eye, and the scanty hair, and the galvanic lurch—
he is safe only within the four walls of an asylum.

Re the hanging of Emma Williams at
Melbourne, it is pleasing to read that “the hang-
man dispensed with the ghastly formality of
wearing a long beard.” Also, “ the execution was
conducted in a most seemly manner.” Evidently

haps The Bulletin would be less fastidious about
woman-chokings if the hangman alwaj’s cut his
nails and used scented hair-oil.

The new co-adjutor Bishop of Brisbane
is known within (and even outside) Anglican
Church circles in his native Victoria as “ Jack ”
Stretch. Ordained by circumstances to the
Church, and born with the gift of oratory, the
clean-cut prelate is “Jack” by nature. He is
one of the few clergymen who can tilt his hat
back from his brows and thrust his hands into his
trousers pockets without seeming to be a goat in
lambs’ clothing. Originally the curate at St.
Andrew's, Brighton (Melb.), young John Stretch’s
first rise was to the “living” of St. Mark’s, Fitzroy,
where he had the assistance of another sprightly
young parson, the Rev. E. S. Hughes, in giving a
cheerful turn to pious thought. From Fitzroy he
was called back to St. Andrew’s as vicar, and in
due course came a proposal to make Jack Stretch
an archdeacon of Ballarat. Warned by the
experience of his good, hard-working father, who
had never got beyond the archdeacon stage of
advancement, the Vicar of St. Mark’s stood out
for the vacant deanery, and carried his point.
And now, after a short term as Dean of Ballarat,
the Venerable Stretch, in the full vigor of his
early forties, is about to seek a warmer region
and fight the devil with a bishop’s staff. In pub-
lishing the photo, of this live Australian and
intellectual ornament to his profession, The Bul-
letin doesn’t wish to cast a suspicion upon his
religious character. It is true that he bears an
outward resemblance to a certain vice-regal
musician. But the inward spiritual difference
between Bishop Jack Stretch and ex-Governor
Bill Robinson is said to be all that the most devout
church attendant could desire. “ Jack ” Stretch
is the first Australian native, educated wholly in
Australia, to be made an Anglican bishop.
He got his Arts-degree at Melb. University,
and his theology at Trinity College, Melb. The
first Australian native to be made an Anglican
bishop was Bishop Parry, of Dover, who was
suffragan to the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Bishop Stretch, by the way, was formerly a clerk
in the Vic. Registrar General’s office, and had
nearly become a barrister,
* * *
The Dean case has now reached the “ re-
luctant ” stage. Everyone is sick of it, and wants
no share in its later development. Salomons,
Q.C., “ very reluctantly ” made his exposure.
Attorney-General Want wishes it “ at the bottom
of the sea,” and “ washes his hands of the whole
business,” relegating to someone else the duty of
finding a bill against the alleged conspirators.
Prosecutor Heydon accepted his brief “ very un-
willingly.” and would have been glad to have had
nothing to do with it. Several police-court wit-
nesses said their evidence was given against their
own inclination. Mr. Johnston, S.M., avers he
did not want the hearing of the case, and several
other minor persons are forced participators iy
the last act.
♦ * «•
Though Salomons, Q.C., was torn witlf
anguish for two months over the knowledge that
Mrs. Dean was an innocent woman unjustly sub-
jected to obloquy and public suspicion, it doesn’t
appear to be on record that, during the period in
question, he assisted her in any way, either directly
or indirectly, much as she then needed assistance.
There is no mention anywhere of a small, dark

man with an eager-looking nose calling around
about dusk, and telling Dean’s suffering wife to
keep up her courage for all would yet be well, and
leaving a surreptitious behind him ; and
no cheering communication, anonymous or other-
wise, is alleged to have come to hand. This con-
duct on the part of such a badly-torn Q.C. seems
a little remarkable. Even Meagher, who was
torn asunder in the tram, couldn’t have panned
out for less than Salomons seems to have done.

Cabman Sweetman, who drove Mary Jane
Hicks to the scene of the alleged Mt. Rennie out-
rage, is to be released Nov. 28, after serving nine
years of his 14 years’ sentence. The three lash-
ings prescribed by the Judge were medically
remitted, because of Sweetman’s ill-health—and,
within the last two years, a large piece of
prisoner’s skull was sawn out in the gaol hospital,
with a view to relieving paralysis, the result of an
old-time accident. The operation was successful.
By this release, the Reid Cabinet throws a tub to
the whale of public opinion, in the hope that
enquiry will now be burked concerning the manner
of the trial and the sentences of the remaining
prisoners.

Rev. “ JACK" STR ETEH, coadjutor Bishop
of Brisbane - the first Australian-horn and
Australian-educated Bishop.
A Ballarat man accused of tampering with
children was found guilty and—sentenced to five
years and doses of the cat at six months’ intervals?
No fear. He was a well-to-do citizen, and was
fined .£25. A fine covers a multitude of sins—in
the well-to-do citizen. The law holds that no
man should have vicious propensities who cannot
afford to pay for them, and it is only when
“ Justice ” cannot take it out of a man’s pocket
that she takes it out of his hide.

It has long’ been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists lias been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a.continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

The Bulletin’s review of “Gallia” recalls
a story of Melb. Coroner Youl’s about a young
couple who had no children, much as they desired
them. The husband called on him one day to ask
if there would be anything illegal in having his
wife’s sister “to supply the baby element.” The
Coroner asked, “What about your wife?” and
was staggered by the reply, “ Oh, it was she who
suggested it.” The Coroner then said he would
like to have a talk with these women, and
presently the would-be father, the wife, and the
sister came together and discussed the situation
with the doctor, and were delighted to find there
was no law against their proposed arrangement,
which was afterwards entered into.

Sweet are the uses of those vice-regal
levees. The other Monday a mob of Melbourne
men went up to Government House that they
might get several newspaper advts. out of shaking
hands with the new Governor. There are two
grades of social distinction in the hand-shaking
“privilege”—a public entree for the many and a
private entree for the few. Seedy individuals who
have been brought to smash by the failure of
Davies or Munro banks and tentacles, are practi-
cally warned off the premises. They don’t come
in anywhere at these demoralising functions.
Next morning, if they are not too poor to buy a
newspaper, they read (in large type) the names of
Mr, J. Munro and Mr. Matthew Davies in the list
of executive councilors who got at Brassey by
the aforesaid private entree. What a lesson in
social distinction for Democrats and busted share-
holders !

Acting-Gov. Madden, of Victoria, got on
to the delicate subject of limbs the other day.
Before a large audience he stated that woman
should ride a bicycle, because the exercise helped
her “ to acquire that condition of roundness, firm-
ness, and plumpness in her body and limbs, which
will make her most attractive to the male sex.
That is all she wants, and all she looks for in the
glass.” This undisguised contempt for everything
except plumpness and limbs abolishes right off
any suspicion that J. Madden is a man of culture,
and reduces him in one act to the level of his
own waxed moustache, Astrachan-coat and
beautifully hair-oiled cranium.
* * *
Ex-Waxcelleucy John Madden played the
Governor to the fullest extent during his term of
stopgapship—and this in a way that no one has
done since British Australia was founded. In
imitation of Lord Hopetoun he even wrote letters
to the Railway Dept, and the police, thanking
them for their attention. Acting-Gov. Stawell
would have sickened at such vanity and display.
W.F.S. merelv took his screw whenever he acted;
and signed pap rs and did what he was told and
went back to the Supreme Court when the
Governor arrived. There is no authority or pre-
cedent for the capers of Madden.

And this was written by George Dean, th
poisoner, who the other day was left without his

pitying women :

were invited to a party at a house whose mistress

baby. Her answer was, “I usually have one
every winter, but this one’s the worst I ever had.
It keeps me awake at night a good deal, and at
first confined me to bed. I believe you yourself
are going to have one just like mine. Would yon

Holl, and other royal academicians, which find
their natural place on the walls of the great State

THE SUNBEAM.
(Dedicated to Lady Brassey.)
The Sunbeam, glad chaser of murky night,
With glory of loveliness, life and light,
Mantling the dawn with each gorgeous hue,
Rivalling diamonds with drops of dew,
On pinnacles kissing the virgin snows
Into maiden blushes of bright red rose,
Recalling the flowers of a thousand dyes
To, in perfumed beauty, unclose tbeireyes,
Awakening the birds’ melodious song,
Beasts, forest and field, and the human throng,
Though sickness and sorrow to pain awake,
And through the grass glides the venomous snake,
Pain, sorrow and wrong are but slight alloy
Compared to the cheerfulness, health and joy
That come in the glow of the Sunbeam.
FOR THE LADIES WHICH GIVE ME MR DINNER.
As the sombre hues of Eve was falling
Upon a prisoner in his lonely cell,
The ifuard outside below the hour is calling
The time the mocking cry—alls well.
Ah me this irotiey fate tis hard to bear
As I offer up to heaven my heart-felt prayer.
And now to find my life for ever more
To be spent within four stone walls.
Tint there is the iron bound prisoner there,
,His life to be closed from this world in dispair,
And as he lies in his cell,
Ehut banished and forlorn,
iLike a limb from his country, his body is cast to be tom.

The Wild-Cat Column .
The Viotomn Banking Commission hns tit last
presented Its report, and bo the disgust of the local
financiers, lb oordlally approves of the Slate Bank
principle. It proposes that the Bost-otfloe and the Com-
niisHi'iners Savings Hanks should he amalgamated and
should const ii ut« one department of the State Institution!.
The second department would he the note-issuing depart-
ment, The State Bank Is to take over the entire note'
Issue of the province, and its paper is to he redeemable
In gold at the Bank itself, hut Is to he legal tender every-
where else throughout Victoria. A gold reserve, equal Co
25 percent, of the issue, is to be kept on hand, which
should bs more than sufficient. The third department
will serve the purpose of a State Land Bank, and will
make advances on landed security at a low rate of in-
terest. It will raise money by the sale of bonds, and lend
out the proceeds at the lowest figure that will cover in-
terest and working expenses, and leave a margin for
possi 1)1 e losses. Tlie fourth department will manage the
Government and municipal accounts and the public debt,
float Government loans, make advances to municipalities,
and keep the current accounts of private cus-
tomers. A lot of the details of the scheme have
Still to lie worked out, hut so far as the out-
lines go the Vie. State Bank idea looks thoroughly
practical and workable. One notable point is that, by
combining the Savings Bank,. the note-issuing business,
the State land-bank, and the ordinary banking depart-
ment in one institution, an enormous saving will be
effected in working expenses. The savings business is at
present done by one Govt, institution and one semi-
private institution with a Govt, guarantee. The note-
issuing business is done by 10 separate hanks, each of
which must do its own printing, and keep its own gold
reserve, and pay its own management expenses. The
Land Bank department would do the work of several
hundred private and joint-stock financiers, each of whom
must make his own working expenses out of the miser-
able borrower. The amount saved in costs of manage-
ment alone, under anything like intelligent control,
should yield a very handsome profit.
If the State Bank of issue gets started, how-
ever, it may he safely assumed that the private institu-
tions will do their level best to keep its notes out of cir-
culation. They will have to accept them, but in place of
sending them out again they will pay their customers in
gold and demand cash from the State Bank for the notes.
Unless the State Bank has branches throughout the pro-
duce, which it won’t have—at least not for some time—it
can o-Iy circulate its notes extensively in the country
d st icts through the private banks, and the only way to
keep ih in afloat is either to let the private hanks make a
profit out of the business, or else to fall upon them wdth
an enactment by which a certain portion of their cash
reserves must be kept in State notes. The latter is the
surest way.
• • • •
The balance-sheet of the National Bank of Aus-
tralasia appears in another column of this issue. The
National, since the reconstruction of 1863, has increased
ns capital by £821,000, and has wiped off £1,650,000 of
deposits, and reduced its total liabilities by a little over
3,000,000. Also, it has coin, bullion, and liquid securities
on hand to the extent of 6s. 10|d. for every £1 of its
liabilities, which is a remarkably good position for its
creditors, considering thatflve-eighthsof thesaid liabilities
don’t begin to fall due until somewhere between 1898
and 1900. If the National would only take (he bold step
of releasing a great part of its fixed deposits, which it is
quite able to do, it would save a lotin interest and should
h-come once more a profitable concern for its share-
holders. At present the terms of the reconstruction
scheme make a considerable difficulty, as no provision
was made for compelling depositors to take their money
before the due date. Still there is every probability that,
if the release was made, a good many depositors would
take their money voluntarily, and thus ease the 4i per
cent, incubus.
• • • •
The shareholders of the Maoriland Colonial
Bank have finally ratified the agreement to sell out. their
institution to the B.N.Z. This transaction is another
commentary on the foolishness and hollowness of bank
b dance-sheets. The Colonial, according - to its published
statements, has £485,000 of capital and reserves
intact, and it realises six per cent, divs., which
are not unreasonably low in these times, and the
directors have stated over and over again that there is no
skeleton whatever in the background, and everything is
quite sound. When the B.N.Z. runs this business with
its own staff and premises it will save at least half the
expenses, and then the profits will he about 11 per cent.
Yet the Colonial gets nothing for the goodwill of this
splendid business, and is so glad to be rid of it that it
sacrifices a lot of the shareholders’ capital and sells out
much below' cost. In other words, it pays the B.N.Z. for
carting the darned thing away. How much faith have
the Colonial shareholders in their own balance-sheet
under these conditions? And what is the good of one
balance-sheet after another assorting that provision has
been made for " bad and doubtful debts ” when an over-
haul promptly reveals £300,000 of doubtful debts that
haven’t been provided for out of only £1,732 000 ad-
vances? ’
Still, the present generation of bankers isn’t
wholly to blame. The public always assumes now that
there is something concealed, and if the Colonial of
Maoriland had acknowledged its £300,000 of doubtful
debts, the public would have promptly assumed that
there were £300,000 worth more not acknowledged
Hohody in these days would ever credit a banker with
telling the whole truth.
• * * •
Re the balance-sheets of the Royal and Colonial
Banks (Melbourne). Both these institutions report that
their assets are so much, “ subject to the adjustment of
losses,” which are to be written off capital as soon as the
new Companies Act is passed. Neither states what the
losses amount to, therefore the amount of the assets is an
unknown quantity. And the auditors, who certify to
the correctness of the balance-sheets, practically certify
that the assets are an unknown quantity. The
proper wav, under the circumstances, is to debit profit
and loss with the amount of the losses, and then certify
to something tangible. J
The London Bank of Australia,, it is cabled
has finished the half-year with a net profit of £7082 Lasl
half year the profit was £8216; the one before the hank
realised £7026, and for the half ending 31st December
1893, the profit was £5986, so for the first time since the
reconstruction there is a serious falling-off. Hitherto
each balance-sheet has shown a decided improvement on
the one before. As usual, the preference shareholders
get their 51 per cent, dividend, absorbing £4721, and the
balance goes to profit god loss account, which has now a
credit balance of £10,222. The ordinary shareholders are
still out in the cold* and as it would take £31,400 (or 41
times the total earnings) to pay a half-year’s div. at the
rate of 5 per. cent, per annum on the ordinary capital
their prospects at present look exceedingly hopeless. The-
earnings, afier tin- pr ference shareholders have had
(heir l,h. of flpsh, nr - at the rate of rather less than Bs.
per cent- on the ordinary capital. The London
Bank has reduced its fixed deposits by £6OO 000'
in. Ihe last 1;8 months, and the reconstructed money is
now only £4,254,000. It has also the very large sum of
£1,654.000 in cash, equal to about 26 per cen f . of its lia-
bilities to the public As the London Bank retained the
right, to,pay off its deposits at six months’
notice, it seems surprising, now that it is ballasted down,
tyith s.') much unprofitable corn, that it doesn’t start the
releasing process on a large scale.

The Vic. Commissioners' Savings Bank—which
formerly lent out its money in hn e sums on 10-storey
Melbourne boom prop -rties and had a had lime in conse-
quence—is now going in for mortgages on agricultural!
lands. It lends up to half the value of die property at h
porc-nt. interest an I 2 per cent, smiting fund, so that 7
percent, pays both principal and interest, whereas vviih
the private lender if generally lakes 7 or 8 or even 10 per

that thcr ■ is room to do ago id business in this line, and
that so far there are absolutely no arrears. This pro-

The municipal fathers of Balmain (Sydney) want
to (ret an Aot authorising them to raise money by a large,

The estate of the deceased Thomas Manifold, of
Oamperdown (Vie.), paid the Treasury £14,374 in legacy

Treasurer watch the local Fat Mao with a ghoulish eye,

present financial year. How can any Treasurer be a

year, and £lOO,OOO deficit looming, and a millionaire
slowly dying of dropsy in the next street?

It is sheer brutality to legislate (as in N.S.W.
Public Service Bill) that, because civil-servants cannot be
garnisheed, therefore they can be "sacked” summarily for
an unsatisfied petty debts judgment. Dismissal may mean
the loss of hundreds of pounds nut of payments made
during many years to the Superannuation' Fund. The
true democratic step is to abolish garnishee orders
altogether, as has been done in England Nay, the ideal
democratic step is to abolish all processes of law for the
recovery of debts. That would bring about a grand
revival of “ spot cash ” and trustworthy “ honor.”

Two more N.S.W. solicitors struck off the rolls
last week, and cases against others are pending. One
shark confessed to receiving a client’s money and "appro-
priating it to his own use.” Regarding the other, it was
said by the Court that " there was evidenc°, and string
evidence, that he had fraudulently misappropriated the
money.” After a Supreme Court Judge had used lan-
guage like this, the criminal prosecution of any ordinary
man would follow automatically.

Cabled from London :—“ A panic on Mr.

whom an Australian mayor should ostentatiously ask to
dinner—if the depositors got to know it!

Vic. Insolvency Judge Molesworth sat down
heavily the other day on the typical assignee. This person
was realising on an estate, the principal item being the
equity of redemption of 1441 acres of land. The property
realised £2882, but. after paying the mortgagee, the
balance was only £245. The assignee, however, charged
6 per cent, commission on the mortgage money, which
didn’t belong to the estate, as well as on the £245 which
did, and thereby mopped up all the little property.
Judge Molesworth, however, fixed the remuneration at
£23 instead of the £152 claimed, and thus another hard
knock was given to the insolvency trustee business in
Melbourne.

Dear Bulletin, —I applied, the other day, for
the advertised secretaryship of a limited liability co. Two
days later I received a type-written note as subjoined
from an utter stranger, who could not have known my
address except through the application referred to :
“ Hear Sir,—l take the opportunity of advising you that
I have for sale 229 shares in the (Blank, Etcetera) Co.”
the co. whose advt. I answered—“paid up to £3 per
Share. They can be had for the nominal sum of Id. (one
penny) each. The price is very low-, and as the co. has
large and valuable assets, they are worth your attention
as a speculation. The sale to he subject to immediate
transfer. If you are not disposed to take the lot, let me
know promptly how many you will purchase, and oblige.
Yours faithfully (Sharebroker).” How’s that for high?
I may mention there’s a big contingent liability on the
shares. Ought I to reply and offer to take over the transfer
in consideration of receiving £lO ?—Yours, X.

Among Broken Hill miners pneumonia is far

to the collapse of burned out timber, may at any moment
make a passage for the flames.

The Ashcroft sulphide process looks like boom-

booming the principal Barrier mines. Lots of things are
beginning to dawn on Australian shareholders—amongst
others, why a long option was secured on the Central.
But there is some consolation in the fact that ±175,000 in
hand is worth fully 1250,000 (at which the mine, it is
said, will be re-sold) in the solution of the sulphide pro-
blem. That problem is not yet solved. It is like Federa-

Coolgardie news is remarkably inconsistent
with the falling prices of the stocks. There are abso-
lutely no dealings in Rayley’s, and Plunderderrys are un-
saleable in London, where there are no enquiries for the
Wealth of Expectations. Golden Bars, after that long-
deferred crushing, have dropped £1 ; Moon’s (one of the
mining tipster’s favorites) looked at one time like “ reach-
ing par”—and now' look a good deal more like falling to
a humble “bob.” Maritana—that marvellous mine
which (if we had believed the Coolgardie wire-workers)
lots of people in London wanted to buy for £90,000, has
now about half that market-value. Maritana North shares
can be got at £1 a dozen. Croesus Extended—another of
the frequently “ tipped ” mines—are less than half the
(market) value of a month ago. After carrying up-
wards the stocks of its surrounding mines, Boidder has
now to suffer for their collapse. That mine is said to he
richer to-day than ever, but its shares are coming down.
• * * *
In their frantic efforts to keep up the Westra-
iian gold-boom the wire-workers say some funny tilings:
“Kalgoorlie.—Warden Fielding is allowing residence-
areas to be pegged out by the holders of miners’ rights.
This will enable miners to build homes for themselves,
instead of sending the bulk of their earnings to the
eastern colonies for the support of their families.” First
time we have heard of any difficulty of this kind on W.A.
goldfields.

London market, after staggering under its enor-
mous load of Westralian “wild cats.” has practically
collapsed. The writer’s last London letter indicated that
the market was getting top-heavy and could not stand
the strain of “wild cat” mongering much longer, and
now comes a cable saying the market has burst. It will
take mines of proved value, but the cats of which nine-
tenths of the W.A. mines floated in London consist are
“ not wanted.” In sympathy with J. Bull’s refusal to
carry any more “ wild-cats,” Coolgardie stocks are
knocked endw’ays.
The mining tipster is again in the soup.
After advising (a month ago) the purchase of certain
Coolgardie stocks at about double their present value, he
says, “ Looking at the West Australian gold market we
think that fear and fright must now have had their day.
The fall had next to nothing to do with the mines them-
selves. They are as good as ever.” Worse hick—they
are as bad as ever. As the losses of the ill-advised buyers
represent money made by others, those who sold out at
top prices in Coolgardie mines as Moons, Golden Bar,
Croesus Extended, &c., should show their appreciation
by banqueting that mining tipster.

The latest about the Golden Bar mine, Cool-
gardie ; “The crushing continues and everything is work-
ing smoothly.” But the market isn’t—shares are just
one-third the value they were a month ago.” The result
of the crushing, so far as can be ascertained, is 2C3oz.
from 471 tons—with 3dwts. in the tailings.” So far as can
be ascertained 1 But they had no trouble, week after
week, in anticipating sor 6 oz. to the ton ! “The process
used is saving 80 per cent, of the gold at a cost of 7dw(g.
to the ton, but it is reckoned that this can be reduced to
sdwts. Mr. W. A. Robertson (the manager) has resigned
and goes East to-morrow.”

papers had any respect for truth they would ask their
Coolgardie correspondents to resign.

A Coolgardie wire : “ Mr. Gerard Stockfeld
starts next week for Africa to report on gold-concessions
in Matabeleland for an English co. If his report is not
satisfactory the co. will transfer its operations to Kalgoor-
lie.” Stockfeld is one of the few Coolgardie mining
examiners whose reports stand the test of time. He has
been there over two years and has condemned more
“ shows” called mines than perhaps any other man on the
field. Had he joined the powerful army of boomers he
would have lost reputation and made more money.

The latest Coolgardie “strike” is that of the
telegraph operators, who demand a minimum wage of
£2OO a year, and are going to stop all wires if they
don’t get it. As the wires are the secret of Coolgardie’s
greatness they will probably win. Imagine Coolgardie a
month in telegraphic darkness! It would die of the
shock.
Another Coolgardie “strike”—this time eight
miles from Siberia. The prospectors nap stone on a
poor-looking reef, finally strike it rich, come into town
with 400 z., and “(he reef is still rich at 3ft. deep.” Of
course, the mine is under offer, and the chances are no
more work will be done till it is sold. When the world
realises that a three-foot hole isn’t a mine and that in 99
cases out of 100 it never becomes one, and that the
patch mines of Coolgardie, including the boss of them
(the Plunderderry), all wither at the sight of a piok, Cool
gardie will have a less easy time,
* * « •
From Coolgardie—and from an experienced
man trained at Freiburg:—“Ooolgardie is booming fast,
but it won't last long. Before Xmas everything will be
quiet again. Next month a lot of sharks will leave this
hot place and take a holiday trip—some to England,
M.L., and Tas. Then there will be a six weeks’ exemp
tion, as usual, without any reason this year, and a lot ol
miners, laborers, and others will have to go to Perth and
Albany, followed by storekeepers and business-men, and
Coolgardie will be, for a couple of months, a deserted
place. The railway will bring back a lot of the grabsters,
but they won’t again boom the place. Sept, and Oct.
have seen the flotation of numerous leases on the strength
ot their being within telescopic sight of the Great Boul-
der, Brown Hill, or some other bigconoern. Some others
have been floated on having the same formation, or the
same vegetation, or the same kind ot lizards running
over the properly, and by ‘ skilful management, &c.,
I have no hesitation, &c., in recommending the purchase
of Leases No, . I have the honor, &c., John Joiinby,
M.A.M.E.Y.X.Z. (Receipt for £lOO enclosed.’) In six
months we will see the results of this sort of thing. Five
or six mines will certainly pay divs., a few more will pay
expenses, and by this time next year we will buy a 10-
head battery in Coolgardie as cheap as an old ’bus in Mel-
bourne.”

From the way in which Croesus Extended is
being boomed in Sydney—a Sunday paper has no less
than four blatant direct puffs in one issue—it might be
thought that a fortune was going begging in this stock.
The Bulletin has reliable information from the spot that
(to put the matter mildly) there is absolutely nothing in
the concern to make a fuss about. Ditto re the Nymagee
copper mine, which is also being most industriously
boomed. This for the benefit of investors; mere stock-
choppers may be left to take care of themselves.

Cue Stock Exchange wires The Bulletin com-
plaining that the eastern press doesn’t boost up the Mur-
chison as that field deserves, and stating that last month’s
export of gold was 10,5500 z., not counting many parcels
taken away privately. Also, the Kinsella battery has
started with splendid prospects to crush from a reef now
opened up fcr nearly 1000 ft. ; and over 50oz. were picked
up the other day after one shot in the Westralian mine,
Cuddingwarra.
When the secretary of One Stock Exchange was
instruct d te send that wire, he was Hot told to say that
Uie Murchison was without one div.-paying mining co ,
and that the gold output from a field of enormousexlent,
with a great number of mines and plenty of water and
crushing-power, is not equal to Mt. Morgan and is in-
sufficient to pay expenses.
Not one, hut two mines on the Murchison last
week “ each dislodged 50oz. of gold with a single shot.”
That is average W. A. gold-mining to a nicety— 50oz. for
one shot. After that, 50 shots for one oz.

H. C. Callahan, who came to Australia early
last year with Bratnober to travel over the Westralian
goldfields, left Sydney this week for London, en route for
South Africa, where he goes under engagement at a
princely salary. This will be good news in W.A., particu-
larly on theMurohison, where the fact that Callahan was
still in Australia, and might again come to report on
Murchison mines, wasa hideous nightmare to somepeople.
He was a cold, brutal truth-teller, and a position wtiich
any W.A. mining man would envy is his rewaid.

Was the late London-Westralian mine-boom on
the strength of the Great Boulder or the Londonderry ?
or was it because some of the pioneer development com-

fraction to the shareholders?

the next will he the last crushing for some time. Nothing

W. R. Wilson won the V.R.O. Derby and D.
James the Melh. Cup. Broken Hill enabled both to go
horse-racing. Wilson, In the very early days of the
Barrier field, was general manager of the Barrier Ranges
Prospecting Association, which owned the Day Dream ;
and afterwards, as a director of the B.H. Proprietary, he
visited America and led to the importation of Schlapp
and Patton. Before Patton came, his brother, S. R. Wil-
son, was general manager. James was a Kapunda (S.A.)
teamster, who happened to he in the district dam-sinking
(he had come up with loads) when Charley Rasp p°gged-
out the Broken Hill. Rasp was then camped at the Nine
Mile, and that was where James’s contract was. Thus the
Kapunda man "got in,” and, luckily, didn’t try hard
enough to get out. The papers that describe him as “ a
successful speculator in Broken Hill scrip,” don’t know.
James, by the way, like pretty nearly all the others, has
done nothing much for Broken Hill’s charitable institu-
tions, which are sorely pressed by the scores of men
whom the mines disable.

Politician story. A famous writer went to
dine with a veteran politician, and sat at table
alongside the politician’s daughter. “ Pa’s going
to get married again,” she whispered. “And
who, may I enquire,” asked the author, “is the
forfunate young lady?” “There she is,” said
the daughter, “ handing round the cabbage.” The
politician was marrying his servant.
William George Garrard,
with his breast plastered over
with war-medals, and at the
head of a ragged and hungry
following, was long a promin-
ent figure in Auckland (M.L.)
unemployed agitations, and
contrived to make things so
lively that whenever a public
man caught a glimpse of the
medals, he used to dodge up
the nearest right-of-way. But
a wily politician muzzled Gar-
rard with the dignified billet of
curator of collarless dogs, and
thenceforth William George
disappeared from the political
arena, to wield the lassoo among
vagrant mongrels. But the
dogs have got to know W.G.,
and when they can’t sport the
legal badge of respectability,
they slink away from him guilt-
stricken, with their tails be-
tween their legs. Thus do
canine intelligence and dog-
conscience circumvent the
efforts of the patriot who sacri-
fices himself on the altar of a
civic billet.
Gov. Brassey once went
as part of an Imperial fad ora-
tion league to Gladstone at
Hawarden. Brassey somehow
got the opening speech to do,
and he did it. He had the
usual mass of statistics and
valuable information collected
by his secretaries. For this
occasion he was more dull and
honestly solid and stolid than
ever. When 15min. of the
speech had dropped with a
sickening thud into the Past, it
dawned on 37 men that one man
would not be missed from such
a crowd. In another five
minutes Gladstone and Brassey
were the sole occupantsof the
big room, and each one of the
deserters was indignant in the
garden at 36 men who had left
Gladstone at the mercy of
Brassey’s eloquence. The indignation took 40min.
or so to cool down, and then the crowd returned
quietly to hear the last 25min. of Brassey’s speech.
The wholeheartedness of the welcome ex-
tended to Gov. Brassey by Vic. Ms.P. may be
judged from the fact that one member, on the day
following his brother’s death, and while the
latter’s body was still unburied, went down the
Bay in the Aramac to meet H.E. and joined in
the festivities.
At Hill End (N.S.W.), recently, a “re-
spected ” Teuton J.P. was adjudicating in a
poultry-stealing case, and apparently thought it
imperative that he should ask every witness some
question or other. One of his interrogations :
“INow, tell me dis; de leedle vite turkey, vas he
speckled or vas he grey ?”
Sample of S.A. Gov. Buxton as a public
speaker; “ Mistah Chahman. It—ah—gives me

There died in Maoriland, the other day,
Heremom Ratitapu, a centenarian. He was in
the prime of life when the first European settlers
came to the Clutha, and he used to relate that,
years ago, when tracking his canoe along the
shallows in the Kaihihu River, he picked up
nuggets which he cast away into the water as
useless.
The times are gone when on one hot day
Justice Redmond Barry called Joseph Henry
Dunne to order in open court for having his wig
off and lying before him on the bar table. Now,
Justices Hodges and Hartley Williams are often
seen with the horsehair beside their notebooks;
and Judge Hickman Molesworth sits for days at
a time without wig or gown.
Gov. Brassey has a queer, little, waddling
walk, reminding one of Elton as the vulgar specu-
lator in “A Bunch of Violets.” He waves a few
inches at a time, making a curious lurch forward
from the hips with every step he takes. It is evi-
dent that he is childishly vain of appearing in
uniform, with a sword dangling at his side, and a
big star pinned on to his coat.
The era of Scotch Governors has suddenly
ended in Australia ; the new Governors are Eng-
lish to a man. It seems but yesterday that there
was an odor of whisky and haggis in every Gov-
mentouse ; now there isn’t an Excellency left who
could wear a kilt without looking as if his knees
were a hidden crime that had suddenly come to
light.
Spagnoletti : “ After all, Parkes is wise.
Rev. Dr. Bromby, in Melb., at 75, took his 18-
year-old wife, who piloted him comfortably into
the haven at 80, and he was happy as the day
was long, instead of having grumbling frumps
around him. Bishop Moorhouse, with conspicu-
ous ignorance of human nature, and ineffable con-
ceit, thought he had laughed Bromby out of it.”
“Betrayal of Trust” is the title of an
article by “ Colonus ” in Auckland (M.L.)
Hebald. Discussing (apropos the Dean case) the
duty of a lawyer in relation to a confession of
guilt made to him by a client, “ Colonus ” says :
“The confession has been committed in trust,
and is there any honest reason that that trust
ought to be betrayed ? The confession is a pro-
perty, and is not the lawyer’s. It is only his in
trust. If he uses it for his own purposes, or for
anybody else’s purposes, he is a traitor.”
Premier Turner seemed inexpressibly un-
happy at the Brassey reception show-functions.
On the occasion of the presentation of the address
from the Leg. Assembly, Turner, in a dress-suit,
looked most miserable. The Governor turned to
him after reading his reply, and said, “ I know
you dislike these formal things, so I out it as
short as I could.” “ Thanks,” growled Turner.
Rumored in London, when the mail left,
that Premier Dick Seddon has his eye on the
M.L. Agent-Generalship, and that Ward, the
present Treasurer, is to succeed him as Premier,
The Agents-General, by the way, are themselves
a striking example of the Democratic character of
Australasian political and social preferment. One
is an ex-gardener, another an ex-miner ; Seddon,
as everybody knows, was formerly a publican.

Another veteran Sydney teacher has died
in the person of R. J. Horniman, who arrived
in N.S.W. in 1838 as assistant-surgeon of the ship
Palmyra. He was in one of the earliest parties
which followed Major Mitchell’s overland track
from Bathurst to Melbourne, and he subsequently
became a tutor under Dr. Lang at the Australian
College in Jamieson-street (1842), subsequently
undertaking the sole control of the College. He
was also connected with W. T. Cape, by whom
many leading Australians were educated. Until
some eight years ago Mr. Horniman continued
teaching. Amongst his pupils he numbered Chief
Justice Griffith (Q.). The veteran was 83 when
he died.

Pastor Fitchett; “ Lord Brassey possesses
one accomplishment unknown to any of his pre-
decessors except, perhaps, Sir Charles Hotham
—he is a practical seaman and holds a master
mariner’s certificate.” There is no “ perhaps ”
about it. Hotham was a fine sailor, and had dis-
tinguished himself abroad before he came to Aus-
tralia. He did great things in the Parana River
against General Rosas, and was the first naval
officer to fight a ship under steam-power.
T. P. O’Connor on Huxley’s courtship :
When the Rattlesnake was in Sydney Harbour the
officers, young Huxley among the number, were invited
to a ball. There, for the first time, he met his future
wife, whose parents resided at Sydney. A few days after
they were engaged, and the ship sailed for Torres Straits
to complete the survey of the north coast of Australia,,
all communication being cut off for months at a time, and
then she returned direct to England. After that brief
acquaintance (not longer than a fortnight) it was seven
years before the lovers saw one another. At the end of
this time, on Huxley's appointment to the School of
Mines, he was in a position to claim his bride and welcome
her to their first home in St. John’s Wood. Huxley’s
love at first sight, and constancy during those seven long
years of separation, was richly rewarded, for it is im-
possible to imagine a pair more thoroughly suited.
Major Te Wheoro, one of the most re-
markable characters in Maori history, is dead. He
fought for the whites against the Maoris ; when
the war was over he went back and lived (as a
Government spy) with the King natives. When
attending Parliament during the session he lived
royally in pakeha fashion; during recess for a
month or so he dwelt tn a whare d la Maori,
sleeping on a mat, eating kumara, and wearing a
blanket, all the time keeping the Minister of the
day well posted in what was going on. Te
Wheoro accompanied King Tawhiao on his
memorable visit to England—when the Imperial
authorities treated the head of a gallant but un-
fortunate race with less consideration than was
extended to the monkeys sent as a present to
Queen Victoria by some African savage or other,
for the Queen received the monkeys but declined
to see Tawhiao. Te Wheoro’s career ended in

From English deanery to Chinese camp.
Peart, the diver of Fitz-
geralds’ show, is a cockney, 25
years old, sft. sin., and 9£st.
His father was a clever trapeze
artist, his grandfather a tum-
bler. He learned swimming
when 14, and practised diving
—never higher than 25 feet,
however, off the banks and trees
of the river Lee. At 16 he was
a public water-triokster—eat-
ing, drinking, talking, smoking,
writing, &c., under water. At
18 he pitted himself against
Finney, the human fish, who
stayed under water five minutes.
Peart stayed minutes, and
was pulled up insensible, with
blood flowing from his nose. In
’B6 lie beat Johnson with a dive
of 80 feet; in ’BB Jules Ferres
with 95 feet—Ferres cried like
a child over it. ’9O, at Johan-
nesburg, marked a new record
—llO feet, and in that year he
exhibited before the late Czar
and Czarina. In ’9l he aston-
ished the Austrians, in ’92 the
Danes and Belgians. In ’93 he
surprised the whole world with
a champion dive of 125 feet,
and then surprised himself, at
Antwerp’s ’93 Exhibition, with
a new dive of 137 feet. In
’94, the Tyne-men, seeing him
come 187 feet from the high level
bridge, reckoned him a corpse,
but were disappointed. And
after this London came each
night to the Royal Aquarium
to see Peart manage his tank-
dive there or miss it and be
mopped up with a sponge. The
corpse duly arrived—supplied
by his rival, Fuller, who leapt
from Tower Bridge, 227 feet, and
disappeared in the river for a
month after. Perhaps a million
people saw Peart flash through
that same 227 feet and bob up
with his head streaming blood
—he had struck a small piece of
driftwood. He went but six
feet below the water’s surface in
the great dive! Up at the
giddy height whence Peart dives not one man in a
hundred has the nerve to stand, and the daring
dive itself is into a tank—a coffin, really,
which must be always tricked out of its corpse.
But Peart likes it. He takes his two deep breaths
while the farthest listener hears him—so deathly
is the crowd’s bush. Then he springs out and up
—hovers ever so momentarily, gauges, dives. A
sweep of right or left hand carries him 12 feet left
or right; coming from 150 feet he can strike any
point in a 30-feet radius circle. Thus he steers
himself though the air and smiles confidently while
women faint. Death had him fairly twice and
missed him. Once at the Royal Aquarium when,
80 feet above the tank, Peart found himself 25 feet
horizontally outside of it. But he steered in some-
how. At Capt. Boynton’s ’94 Water Show the
ropes of Peart’s platform broke, letting the
diver down feet-first a sudden 80 feet. He
shrieked that time, for he couldn’t turn to
steer himself into the tank, but he managed
it somehow, hitting the water with his left
side and face, bruising himself terribly.
In Melbourne, where he dived 137 ft. and put his
platform higher when the authorities ordered him
lower, he hurt his stomach through the bag going
wrong in the Monte Oristo feat, and spat up
blood. At Adelaide he won a .£2O wager from a
soulless wretch who betted that he could tie the
bag so that Peart couldn’t get out. But Peart
undid the four knots and pocketed the cash.
Peart always closes his eyes entering the water —
the impact would damage them. And hitherto he
has (so he says) closed his eyes to many offers of
marriage—two from titled ladies. But he swears
that he will take the next good offer. Many
people have written to him asking him not to dive,
and in London a representative of the County
Council used to hang round and officially see that
Peart’s arrangements were right. Peart has given
£lOOO to London hospitals. He is a teetotaller
and cigarette smoker. He will dive any man in
Australia 65ft. into three feet depth of water.


ADVERTISEMENTS ON POST-
CARDS.
tO THE EDITOR OP THE AROUB.
Sir—Will yon kindly afford me a short
space in your columns in which I may make
my public protest against the newly-issued
postal-cards.
Again, I am' not a total abstainer,
duty obliges me to send a la'ge number of
short memos, and instructions to the young
clergy-and readers of my archdeaconry, and
I have hitherto freely dsed postal-cards for
this purpose, but it certainly sieems to me
altogether unseemly that while I send these
young men good advice on one side of the
card, I shall be compelled in future to re-
commend them to .drink “lager beer” on
the bther. —Yours,
JOHN E. HERRING.

POLITIEAL POINTS
The N.S. W. Labor-party met Davitt sec-
retly, but seemed afraid to recognise him openly.
Why ?
Just-ice Minister Gould has just liberated
from prison three hundred—trout. As fish-
blooded animals they probably had his official
sympathy.
Member Price’s motion re Justice Win-
deyer still stands on N.S.W. Assembly notice-
paper. If Price is worth his salt he will press it
to a division even if he has to stand alone in that
division.
The Australian Parliament that passes a
Bill to abolish the political portfolio of the Attor-
ney-General, and to make that officer a civil-ser-
vant, permanent under all political changes, and
M hard to remove [almost) as a Judge, will be a
Parliament of deliverance, and the reformer who
beads the assaHt that leads to such a blessed
change will be be tWasbington of his political
sphere.

It is passing strange that the Australian

paper in Australia to approve the liberation of the
criminal solicitor Rofe under the First Offenders’
Act.

Heydon (M.L.0.); “In consequence of the Attor-
ney-General being a politician and a member of
the Ministry, and as attacks had been made
on him, there certainly is a danger that the
administration of justice might be brought under
suspicion, if,’’ &e. No, sir. No danger that it
might be, and no “if ” about it. It has heea, and
it is.
The prediction is verified. M‘ll wraith
is acting as Q. Agent-General. Not a word yet
of how Garrick came to resign. Perhaps the
Govt, organs thought it too like political vengeance
to cast a pleasant hue over the dying days of
Boodlewraith. Rumored that the Ministry hesi-
tated long between MTlwraith and a lay figure
from Madam'- Tu-saud’s, but loyalty to their old
chief won the day.
Queensland some time ago imposed a half-
penny postage on newspapers upon the understand-
ing that N.S.W. would follow suit. N.S.W. has
not yet followed suit, and is losing, say, £40,000
revenue annually by the tact. The daily papers
own the N.S.W. Govt., body and soul. Besides,
free postage means the free circulation of hundreds
of shoddy organs masquerading as newspapers,
and in N.S.W. Shoddy is king.
Up to date, Morehead, M.P. (Q.), is the
last consistent Freetrader to hit his gimcrack Joss
on the point of the jaw—for this occasion only.
He wants an export-duty on wool going South to
encourage local sales. And, like them all, he
trotted out Mill’s musty dictum in favor of a
leetle Protection for new countries. Freetraders
can get too much of a good thing. Morehead, of
course, is in the wool-line himself.
In his enthusiasm for Freetrade, Jawbone
Neild, M.P., was last week led into stating that
the N.S.W. people had declared inferentially
against Australian Federation. Jawbone’s argu-
ment was that the N.S.W. voters had twice asked
emphatically for Freetrade; whereas Australian
Federation meant “ interprovinoial Freetrade
and protection against the world.” The last
clause is true. But the voters have not asked
emphatically for Freetrade. The Labor members
have permitted Freetrade assumptions by sinking
individually their fiscal opinions. Neild’s logic
should enlighten them.
The curse of Government by Contradic-
tion has fallen upon the last place which had
escaped it—Castlemaine (Vic.), the constituency
of the late J. B. Patterson. Hitherto, however
tangled the issues before the country at large,
Castlemaine has had only one distinct, unmis-
takeable point to decide. Patterson or no Pat-
terson, that was the point upon which every
Castlemaine election bad been worked for years.
The beautiful jumble which constitutes modern
politics had no influence whatever upon it. Now,
Castlemaine will be as ignorant as any other con-
stituency of what it is voting for.

ston is much discourag 'd over the annihilation of
his pet State Advances scheme, which was rejected
owing to the desertion of two erstwhile sup-
porters, under very peculiar circumstances.
One instance of the maimer in which
Boodlewraith is cooking the coming elections.
Q. Govt, or National Ass. (different names for
the same thing) has circularised nearly everybody
at Texas ,Dumaresq River, to the effect that they
will have to satisfy the electoral court, to be held
at Stanthorpe in Nov. (no date), on oath, that
they are qualified to vote. Some of the recipients
have been bom at Texas, and others have resided
there for years, and' have been on the rolls for
years. It is only from 70 to 80 miles to Stan-
thorpe, and there is at Texas a court-house, with
magistrates thick as blackberries on a hedge.
Education Minister Jacob Garrard’s recent
comments on women teachers suggest that there
is in the administration of the N.S.W. Education
Act some influence which causes Minister after
Minister to stumble into some offensive meanness.
Suttor chopped down screws ; Carruthers cut
off the allowances for school-cleaning, and thus
threw the job on the teachers ; and Inglis extin-
guished the school-fires in the depth of winter.
The story goes that
Minister Carruthers will
be the chairman of the
N.S.W. Civil Service
Commission —and will be
succeeded as Lands Min-
ister either by Ashton or
Milieu, M.’sP.
The Maoriland Cri-
minal Court of Appeal
broke down badly at
almost the first attempt.
The law by which it was
constituted, it is dis-
covered, allows it to grant
a new trial only if the
Judges are convinced
that the original verdict
was against the weight
of evidence. The first
case of great public inter-
est which came before it
was that of the alleged
murderer, Louis Chemis,
who applied for a new
trial on the ground that
some valuable evidence
had come to light since
his conviction, and the
Court decided that it had
nothing to do with new
evidence, and dismissed
the applicition. The
Court of Appeal thus
doesn't promise to be of
much value. It can’t
grant a fresh trial because
new facts have come to
light, or because evidence
was i m properly ad ini tied,
or on account of mis-
direction by the Judge,
or because the witnesses
for the prosecution prove
to be persons of bad
character, or because of
perjury. It must stick
to the one question as to
the weight of evidence,
and as evidence isn’t coal
to be weighed by the ton
even that is a matter
wherein its usefulness
will depend al most wholly
on the Judge’s liver.
The S.A. Govt, is making the abolition
of capital punishment an open question. Premier
Kingston and Education-Minister Cookburn are
against the death-penalty, but their colleagues are
in favor of its retention.
From Maoriland, Victoria, N.S. Wales
and S.A. come the same wail. The Parliamentary
session is either ended or getting near its end, and
hardly anything has been done, and half the
measures which represent the labor of the session
must be thrown overboard unfinished from sheer
weariness, to be started all over again next session.
Why doesn’t some plain, sensible statesman intro-
duce the plan of taking up the unfinished bills
next session where they were left off ? The plan
of starting everything afresh would apply well
enough in a new Parliament, but when the Par-
liament is the same it t > go straight ahead.

Treas. Holder (S.A.) proposes to square
his budget by reducing the income-tax exemption
from .£2OO all round to .£125 on incomes under
£425, with no exemption whatever on incomes

as heretofore : 4d. in the £ on incomes under £lOOO
derived from personal exertion, and fid. in the £

£lOOO on incomes derived from property, and Is.

Tasmania are the only provinces which recognise
the just principle that incomes arising from per-

carious, should be taxed on a lower scale than
those arising from property, which are more or
less permanent. The owner of the most stupen-

MY PHILOSOPHY
[Foe The Bulletin.]
If it is true that you’re a flirt
And sweetly uioek my wooiflg,
I vow I’m not the least hit hurt
At what they say you’re doing.
It may be so—your pretty speech
May be deceitful patter,
May be the same to all and each ;
But if it is, what matter?
I’d still woo on, though this were true,
And every doubt I’d smother :
For rather I’d be fooled by you
Than loved by any other.

Official Examination
OF
The Mutual Life Insurance
Co. of New York.
(AT THE REQUEST OF THE COMPANY.)
State of New York? Insurance Department.
JAMES F. PIERCE, Superintendent.
Albany, N.Y., July 17, 1895.
For about eighteen months the available force
of the department has been engaged upon a
minute examination of The Mutual Life Insur-
ance Company of New York. This examination
was begun and conducted substantially to a con-
clusion by the late Michael Shannon, my deputy,
who for many years had been the Chief Examiner
of the department. His sudden death just at the
conclusion of this investigation, and before the
facts and figures which he had collected had been
finally formulated by him, throws upon the
Superintendent the duty of presenting the results
in an intelligible form. The thoroughness and
accuracy of Mr. Shannon’s methods make it neces-
sary to do hardly more than to arrange his own
conclusions.
The examination relates to the condition of the
Company at the beginning of this calendar year ;
the date is coincident with that of the Company’s
annual statement for 1895. The results of the
official examination substantially coincide with
the Company’s statement. The custom of the
department, in such examinations, is not to
depend upon the book entries, but directly to
scrutinise the property, real and personal, which
the books represent as assets, to determine the
liabilities according to the standard of the de-
partment, and to examine and investigate all the
disbursements of the Company.
The traditional usage of the department, though
not prescribed by law, excludes from a Company’s
assets all items whose cash value cannot be tested
by the examination ; Hence the entire amount of
commuted commissions, of agents’ balances and
the loading of premiums, deferred or in collection,
have been deducted from the Company’s Assets
in the tables of the department.
Real Estate.
The Company’s holdings and real property con-
sist (1) of lands and buildings purchased for its
own use and buildings erected for its own offices,
and (2) lands and buildings purchased under fore-
closure of loans.
Office Buildings.
The first class includes the principal building on
Nassau, Cedar and Liberty Streets, and the former
principal office on Broadway and Liberty Street,
both in the City of New York ; a building in
Boston, one in Philadelphia, one in San Fran-
cisco, and three of moderate cost in foreign
countries—viz., one in Berlin, one in the city of
Mexico, and the third in Sydney, Australia. I
have carefully investigated the value of each of
these properties with the aid of the best experts,
and believe them all to have the value assigned to
them on the Company’s books. I find no evidence
of unwise expenditure upon either of these pro-
perties.
In 1880 the Company purchased from the United
States the old Post Office building, and erected
upon its site the Home Office, about one hundred
and ninety-seven feet front by one hundred and
fifteen feet deep. The neighbourhood was then
beyond the financial centre of the city, but this
building gave it a new character, attracting many
corporations, banking firms and professional men.
The Company has since made purchases of addi-
tional land adjoining its offices and large additions
to its building. The land in the vicinity has
steadily increased in value. The appraiser of the
department has valued the entire property now
held by the Company as its principal building at
a sum higher than that at which it is carried on
the books. The building on Broadway which was
formerly the Company’s Home Office, is also
valued by us at more than the Company gives
itself credit for.
Foreclosed Property.
The Company’s method of dealing with this
class of property illustrates its wise conservatism,
and has my approval.
The cash value of this real estate as determined
by the appraisers for the State is in the aggregate
more than it represents on the Company’s boobs
and statements. While the department in this
report cannot recognise prospective increase of
value as an element in its appraisals, it is yet the
opinion of the Superintendent, founded on the
detailed returns of the experts whom he has em-
ployed, that the valuation is one which in the
aggregate no probable event in the future will
reduce, while circumstances are likely to arise
which will materially increase it.
Stocks and Moneyed Corporations.
In recent years the Company has made invest-
ments in the shares of certain financial institu-
tions, These are among the best-known of the
strong financial institutions of New York, and the
shares of each yield in dividends or additions to
surplus a fair percentage on their cost. After ex-
amination I find that each of these purchases of
stock has proved a good investment. In no case
has the Company credited itself upon its books or
in its statements with the full market value of
such stocks. Its estimate in each case is conser-
vative, and is less by a considerable margin than
the price of the stock in the open market.
The same disposition to conservatism has pre-
vailed in the Company’s valuation of all its stocks
and bonds. It is an evidence of judicious fore-
sight in the Company to carry all its stocks and
bonds upon valuations which are not likely to
prove too high even in case of a panic. I approve
its policy in this respect. No item included in the
bonds and stocks owned is over-valued ; in fact,
all of them are appraised by the Company at a
lower rate than current sales would justify.
Cask on Hand and on Deposit.
The items of cash on band and on deposit and
interest in banks and trust companies have been
carefully examined, and the entries in the books
of the Company verified by a careful count of cash,
and by an examination of the books of the deposi-
taries. The department has also inquired into the
standing and security of the banks and trust com-
panies selected as depositaries, and into the rateof
interest obtained and finds tiiat the perfect safety
of the funds has been the first consideration of the
Company, and that it has avoided taking a risk
for the sake of higher rates of interest upon the
large sums awaiting investment.
Loans on Real Estate Security.
The examiners have verified every item on the
Company’s books claiming a lien on real estate and
find that the loans thus secured and drawing in-
terest amount to $71,339,415.92 in exact accord-
ance with the Company’s Statement. A very large
amount of time and labor has been employed by
the department in examining the titles and ap-
praising the values of the five thousand nine
hundred and seventy pieces of property upon
which these loans have been made. In this work
the department has employed the highest skill it
could command and the results are satisfactory.
Safcguards.
The department has investigated the methods
employed by the Company in protecting its col-
lections, balances and remittances and in con-
trolling its agency accounts and expenditure, and
cordially approves the system, under which there
has been substantial exemption from loss ever
since it was organised.
Medical Examinations.
The entire subject of the conduct of the medical
examinations of candidates for insurance has been
investigated by a special examiner of exceptional
competence, Dr. E. B. Rankin.
Business in Foreign Countries.
While The Mutual Life Insurance Company of
New York has for many years offered the privi-
lege of membership to healthy lives in all parts of
the civilised world, it is within the limits of the
United States that it is best known and that its
activity is greatest.
The department has, nevertheless, deemed it
essential to inquire minutely into the character of
the foreign business. As the result of such in-
quiry, I find that the Company in all its foreign
business has practised the same sound and conser-
vative methods which have always characterised
its business in the United States.
Income, Disbursements, Etc.
There is nothing in the items of the Company’s
Statement to require special comment here, inas-
much as the only result of the examination has
been to verify and confirm the figures of each item
as computed or estimated by the Company itself.
Without enlarging, therefore, upon the several
entries, I reier to the tables of Assets and
Liabilities, of Income and Expenditure, wlncb are
given below, remarking that a thorough examina-
tion of the expense and disbursement accounts
shows no instance of any unlawful, illegitimate or
improper expenditure, and that each several entry
has been subjected to rigid and thorough scrutiny
in all its details.
The prosecution to a final completion of the
work which Mr. Shannon had so thoroughly
planned and so nearly finished has only confirmed
the conclusions arrived at by him. The communi-
cation to the Legislature and to the public of the
results of such an examination as this, when they
fully justify and strengthen the position which
one ot the foremost financial institutions of the
United States has long held in public confidence,
is perhaps tiie most agreeable dmy of the Superin-
tendent. I take great satisfaction in certifying,
after a minute and laborious examination of The
Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York,
that the Company is solvent and strong and is con-
ducted in all respects in accordance with the law
and sound business principles. In each instance
in which no difference has been expressly pointed
out in this Report between the conclusions of the
official examination and the statements already
published by the Company, each of those state-
ments has been by that examination completely
tested and proved accurate. No officer or em-
ploye of the Company receives any emolument or
perquisite other than the salary awarded to him
by the Board of Trustees, and no Trustee or
Officer of the Company is permitted to receive or
does receive any commission on loans, insurance
or any other of its transactions.
Every book, paper, document and record in the
Company’s possession has been freely opened to
the examiners of the department, and the Execu-
tive Officers and Official Staff have given cheer-
ful assistance when required. The books are kept
with system, accuracy and simplicity, and show
the condition of each account precisely as it exists,
without resort to bookkeeping devices to vary or
modify the intent and effect of any debit or credit
entry. t
I he Company has prosecuted its affairs upon a
high plane of propriety, avoiding doubtful practices
and unseemly methods, always seeking to uphold
its own dignity as a beneficent and economic factor
in developing the civilisation of out age and
country. Every branch of its nusim-ss is admin-
istered with ability in the interest of its members,
and a wise and vigorous executive management
controls all its departments and combines their
energies in administering its great trust. It
merits in all respects the confidence of the insured
and of the community at large. And, in con-
clusion, I, James F. Pierce, Superintendent of
the Insurance Department of the State of New
York, do hereby certify that the true condition of
The Mutual Life Insurance Company of New
York, after the examination hereinbefore recited,
was upon the 31st day of December, A.D., 1894,
according to the appraisal of its Assets made by
this department, and the valuations of its
Liabilities, also made by said Department, pursu-
ant to the standard established by the laws of the

A Great Typewriter
Company.
The United Typewriter and Supplies Com-
pany of New York, the premier firm of its kind in
America and Europe-with branches in the chief
cities of the world is now firmly in
Australia, where the principal office is at 114 Pitt-
street, Sydney, opposite G.P.O. It claims that its
EXTERIOR VIEW.
r.hreetnachines, theCaligraph, Yost, and Densmore,
are each the best of its type. The company,
which, by the way, has taken over Mr. J. E. Cun-
n high am’s Caligraph Agency, sells any one
machine without prejudice; gives the intending
. . . * , . •, ,i c • !
purchaser impartial advice, suit* the pro essiona
or business man with the type of machine whose
special attributes are adapted to his particular
necessities Once Henry George’s wants were
known, he was fitted with a Yost so satisfactorily
’., . .
that he clung to it when the coach lie was on
overturned ; he fell not upon his head, but upon
the Yost. He pronounces it invaluable.
# * *
Per minute the average penman dis-
figures paper witli 15 to 20 scrawly words; the
, it , . ■ . an
average, half-awake ypist scores 40 to 60 pertect
imjiagc, ii<ui . 1
words. For one minute the real expert penman
gqos 50 words, which no one, not even himself,
can read afterwards; whereas the expert typist
clicks off 180 words—clear, sharp, beautiful. More-
i
over, the typist using carbon paper simultaneously
strikes off 20 of his artistic copies, while the
expert pen-criminal sweats blood and ink over his
spider-legged one. Further, the typist using
Edison’s Mimeograph records 3000 perfect copies.
So, compared with the typewriter, the pen is
little more than a burnt stick. The pen' is
very well in its humble way, being, indeed,
mightier than the sword, but the typewriter is
incomparably mightier than the pen, and the
lovely girl who works it—but we’ll let that pass.
# # #
Typewriting takes less space than pen
scrawling, its paper is cheaper, so firms with cor-
respondence daily above one sheet save on
stationery and postage; also typewriting press-
copies much more neatly than pen apologies. The
typewriter changes mail-day, the merchant’s curse,
into holiday, for the mail can be dictated 70 words
per minute.
• * #
To support the typewriter the minds of
the professional and commercial world come forth
in evidence. The author points to his 1500 lines
poem—the great little thing of his own —the
scientist to his treatise, the barrister to bis brief,
the solicitor to his abstract, the banker to his
balance - sheet, the Government office to the
inspector’s report, the limited company to the
statement, the commercial man to the inventory
and invoice, the parson to his sermon, the young
man to the love-letter, the recording-angel to the
sins of the world.
* * *
Why is ifc not universally used ? Because,
up to a few years ago, most members of civilised
nations could sign their names only with a cross.
Typewriting is a revolution, which has come so
suddenly on pen-writing that the human race,
overjoyed at being able to scrawl out its emoti' ns
all by itself, won’t giveup that triumph yetawhiie.
In fact, the typewriter has to be sprung upon the
average human being with considerable caution ;
one island missionary, on first seeing it, flung over
his adonted belief in Christianity, knelt down and
worshipped “The Iron God who writes,” By
and bye, however, the typewriter, like all other
valuable innovations, will safely recommend itself
everywhere, and then it will become as popular as
the pen in its day.
# * #
The typewriter is in this age of effective
machines singularly effective. It saves time, life,
souls, money, breach of promise cases. It is good
business —the clergy have said it. One leading
Australian clergyman says “the Caligraph has
more points of utility and greater durability than
any other typewriter I have ever seen.” Another
says, “ it delivered me from my terrible foe, the
writer’s cramp ; it shortened my work one half,
and I always forgot its cost in the pleasure I found
in its constant use.” Scotch gentleman, too, this
one! And no one is prouder of his Caligraph
than the Sultan of Morocco, who clicks off daily
manifold copies of the orders to the harem.
• • •
It saves time, compared with the pen—.4o
minutes per hour, 1.8 hours per day, 243 days per
year, 46 years out of 70, the compound interest
and capital of the bad language and crying caused
by the average man’s bad writing, and the long
account to be settled thereon in the great here-
after. No business man with an eye to money or
dispatch raisisa word against the typewriter. The
only valid objection was from a countryman who
wouldn’t have it because it wouldn’t spell.
• # #
The new Yost No. 4, so signally success-
ful in England, has some striking testi-
menials. Rider Haggard says: “The Yost
has proved most satisfactory.” B. L. Far-
jeon : “The Yost typewriter is admirable.”
Mrs. Campbell - Praed ; “ The Yost has
delighted me.” Sir William (great gun) Arm-
strong: “It is the royal road in writing.” The
Rev. Curnock. editor Methodist Recorder ; “ It
is clear, strong, quickly learned, easily handled ;
a young girl learned to use it in one day, and in a
few days acquired fair speed.” The President of
St. John’s College, Oxford, says: “I carry it
about with me wherever I stay, and had nodiffi-
eulty in learning the use of it.” Mr. Robert
Gladstone, nephew of the Grand Old Man,
8.C.L., M. A., Oxford, certifies: “It is the per-
fection of simplicity and ingenuity.” It was
with a Yost that Pinero wrote “ The Second Mrs.
Tanqueray.” The Yost has been the
English, French, Indian, and Colonial Govern-
ments, the principal railway and engineering com-
panics, over 20,000 professional and business men,
many earls, and the Emperor of Germany.
Though only five years old, it has gained seven
gold medals.

A few of the testimonials from indepen*
dent authorities regarding the Cahgrap i wing
conviction home to the w' Ick I< r , rin "
cipal Under-Seoretary of N.S.W. says, I have
much pleasure in stating that it has more than
fulfilled my expectations”; the N.S.W. Hansard
chief says, “the Caligraphs (in use four years)
have very much expedited the work of this office”;
tile Master in Equity testifies, “ the Caligraph has
proved invaluable” ; the Commercial Banking
Company of Sydney writes, “It is invaluable —
no properly-appointed office should be without
one.” Nearly 200 Caligraphs altogether are used
in the N.S.W. Government departments. The
Sydney Post and Telegraph Office uses 26.
The Postal Telegraph Company of America re-
cently contracted to take on 1000 Caligraph
machines in consignments as required—the largest
contract ever made in connection with type-
writers. The Caligraph has taken 15 medals,
The 1895 No. 4 Caligraphs show great improve-
ment over former models,
# # •
The Densmore is the standard shift key machine,
and a very recent invention. It is almost noiseless
inaction, and is already recognised in the home
Q f typewriters (America) as the most improved
typewriter of the shift key pattern. It was
adopted by the United States War Department
after competitive tests. The Carnegie Steel Com-
pany, Pittsburg, uses 33 and says “ there has never
bftet j a cent, laid out in the way of repairs.” The
Boston Globe uses 18, and the Rapid Addressing
Machine Company considers it a boon. The
American Screw Co., Providence, R.J., the largest
concern of tlie kind, uses 11 Densmores, purchased
*»! T
machine for repairs.” It came to Sydney for the
first time only three months ago.
J ■ m
.
Altogether the typewriter is one of the
most useful achievements of science, and the
United Typewriter and Supplies Co., pushing fer-
ward the best machines on the almost new field of
Australia, should reap a well-deserved harvest for
many years to come.

There are indications of improvement in trade and in the prospects of the producing interests,
which may be marred if the exceptionally dry season now prevailing continues. The value of real
property however cannot yet be said to have been affected favorably, and the directors, therefore,
think it advisable to withdraw the reserve fund of .£lOO,OOO, and to add that amount to the sum held

The Bulletin’s History of the Dean Case. Fully
illustrated. Price, 6d.
From Melb. “Society” paper: “The
dance which was to have been given by Mesdanies
and in consequence of a death in
he family—has been indefinitely postponed.”
P.M. : Can’t Bulletin readers help
Henry Lawson to a better title for his verse-book
than “Block and Backblocks?” What about
“Shanty Songs and Wallaby Rhymes?” or
“Bush Sighs and City Cries?”
A Yankee record once more. A special

“Jimmy” Taylor, M.L.O. (Q.), who died
recently, was known as king of Toowoomba,
as, up to a few years ago, he practically owned
the red-soil township. For the last three years
he was wheeled about in a bath-chair, and died by
inches. He was “ humping bluey ” when Kings-
ley wrote “Geoffrey fiamlyn.” Jimmy stuck
fondly to two old-time favorites—a battered felt
wideawake and a short-stemmed soot-black clay.
Often he horrified his latter-day aristocratic rela-
tives by turning up at social functions in a dingy
suit of tweed and feeling vainly in his pockets for
a light. He rather astonished vice-royalty once
by saying, “ How do, Sir ——, got a match ? ”
For coughs, colds you can’t beat Colemane
and Sons Eucalypte Extract.*
Says an S.A. paper :
Since we have enjoyed the luxury of paid members of
Parliament our National Debt has enormously increased,
wages and salaries have been lowered, our sheep have
diminished in value, our exporting producers have been
taxed, hampered, and worried by taxation and every
other possible way; land-values have declined; and
money has been withdrawn. Were it not that from out-
side causes interest of money has also declined, and
Broken Hill, poor South Australia would by this time
have been like some unfortunate water-logged derelict.
It is yet time by prompt and resolute action to save her
from insolvency.
All these things—even the fall in the values of
sheep and land because wool and meat and wheat
have gone down in London—have taken place
since S. A. had payment of members. Therefore,
they are caused by payment of members. Also,
they have all taken place since Queen Victoria
came to the British throne. Therefore, they are
equally caused by Victoria being on the throne.
Consequently, let Victoria be abolished and the
price of wool will go up. Logic is a great institu-
tion.
The only known cure for influenza is Cole-
mane and Sons Eucalypte Extract.
Bishop Julius, of Christchurch (M.L.), on
the plate;—
I never saw so much bad coin in all my life. To offer
to the Church—the cause of God—money that the baker
or the butcher would not accept shocks me. The man
who would do that sort of thing wants the grace of God—
or three months.
There is a fund of unconscious humor about a
bishop who thinks that the grace of God or three
months’ hard labor will answer equally well.
Probably they would answer equally well, but the
bottom would fall out of the bishop industry if
the public got to know of it.

Keefs at Sheep-station Creek, anew Vic. field,
are turning out some payable battery stone. Of three
recent erus’lings, a claim on Milne’s line turned in 950 z.
from 42 tons, while the Highland Chief 91ft, body of
stone lias averaged 6oz. for small orusbings ; and the
Golden King has topped with a fine yield of 296 si.
from 12$ tons. Strange to say, the Golden King has been
abandoned twice, and ft couple of feet driving in the old
workings brought the new party on to the present rich
shoot. One never knows what the next pick-stroke will
reveal. Sheep-station gold is very fine and worth about
£4 ss. an oz , which heats the Beechworth gold, always
ranked the dearest by the Mint.

silver and the gold together, and if there is one hundred
pounds worth of gold in the stone it will give you £9B

have prosperously mined and have had many dutiful
children.”

From Mount Alexander Mail, Castle-

In every department he has controlled he has left the

the anthoriser—we believe, in some part, the author of
many reforms, including the clock-work tell-tale on the
pillar boxes, the painting of them red, so that they might

He was in some part responsible for the pillar-

Visitors to the Spouting Spring at Heli-
don, 70 miles from Brisbane, are always astounded
at the quantity of water they can consume at the
Spring. Ten or 12 tumblers in an hour or so are

time. Something beneficial is always added to
the system by every glass of Helidou Spa water

advocacy of Federation would finish off that wild
dream in one act, but the most imaginative

An examination into the business opera-
tions and present position of the Mutual Life In-
surance Company of New York has just been
instituted by the Insurance Department of the
State of New York, at the request of the com-
pany The investigation was of the most careful
character, engaging the attention of the Depart-
ment for about eighteen months, and the result
was to verify, in every particular, the statement
issued by the company’s executive at the close of
last year. In the report, which is dated July 17th,
1895, the Superintendent of the State Insurance
Department, Hon. James F. Fierce, rema' ks
“'l’he communication to the Legislature and to
the public of the results of such « n examination as
this, when they fully justify and strengthen the
position which one of the foremost financial insti-
tutions of the United States has long held in pub-
lic confidence, is perhaps the most ag ecable duty
of the Superintendent.” The report, ivhich is in-
teresting reading, will be found set forth in full
on page 17 of this issue of The Bulletin.®
IMPORTANCE OF DIPPING SHEEP.
WRITING upon the above subject, the National
Wool Company warns farmers about the impor-
tance of keeping their sheep free from ticks and
other parasites by dipping their flocks regularly
after shearing. It is estimated that an animal
kept healthy by this useful economy will give a
return of at least Is. fid. per head more than one
suffering from these parasities; a clean sheep keeps
in better condition, produces a heavier fleece and
one which will bring higher value than a diseased
animal’s. It is pointed out that wool-buyers are
more exacting in their selection of wools than
heretofore, and insist upon careful preparation.
The lesson of the day taught by depression and
low prices is that sheep farmers and agriculturists
must regulate their operations on a scientific basis,
must turn out their products in fir>t-class style,
and must exercise frugality and care in every step,
both of production and distribution. Sheep farmers
require suitable breeds of sheep for the country
they occupy, and should institute a thorough system
of culling, dipping, and avoiding overstocking,
and applying intelligence to the sorting, skirting
and classing of the fleeces. Under these condi-
tions sheep farming will pay handsomely, oven at
the present low’ prices of wool. The National
Wool Company wish to put fanners on the right
track, and recommend “ Odam’s ” dip.*
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Music and Quiver supplied the two most in-
comprehensible perfoimances in the Melbourne Cup.
They hud finished second and fourth for the Stakes on
Derby Day, hut at no point of the two-mile race were they
running up to that form. Music, indeed, was lengths
behind everything after a mile and a half had been
covered, yet the Tasmanian horse managed to pass four
and twenty of them in the last half-mile, when its victory
was out of the question.
• * • •
The Bulletin’s argument that this year’s Cup
was at the mercy of any brilliant three-year-old, inasmuch
as the old horses seemed a very moderate lot, proved cor-
rect enough. Five youngsters finished among the leading
eight. Auraria, the winning filly, and Waterfall, placed
fourth with 7st. 101 h. on tils back, were meeting all the
field, bar The Admiral, on had terms. Even Hova,
although he falsified the idea that lie was a uou-slayer,
showed himself inferior to Auraria, and certainly no better
than Waterfall at weight for age over the iwo miles.
Hova is only a brilliant horse by comparison with others
that shine less, and can't be failly called a slayer in the
Carlline sense of the word.
» » • •
J. H. Hill, the trainer of Auraria, didn’t seem
to lake the lilly's Derby defeat at all seriously. When he
remov ed the light cloth from Auraria, previous to fixing
her up for the Cup, a friend remaiked that she hadn’t
given s ilisfaction in the Derby. “ She’ll give satisfaction
to-day, barring accidents,” said Hill. There was no
gaping crowd standing around to hear the remark.
Auraria was saddled in tire far corner .stall of lire bird-
cage, next to the gate at which sire had just entered, and
tire public left her severely alone. Wallace was their idol
among the three-year-olds. Wallace won a “muddling”
run Derby by the skin of his teeth, whilst Auraria,
without being pushed at the finish, was only a length
and a half behind the “illustrious sou of Carbine.” So
they to >k 6 to 1 about Wallace outright, and allowed
the “beautiful daughter of Trenton” to go out
at 8 to 1 for a pi ice, forgetting (if they had ever
known) that she came o>er from Adelaide w ith a great
reputation for stamina, and would he ridden iu the Cup
by tier clever D iby jockey, whereas Wallace and Oscillator
were at the disadvantage of having much weaker riders
than before. A combination of ciicumstances accounted
for Anraria’s absurdly outside price in the Chip-betting.
First there was the sex prejudice, w hich kept her out of
favor until she should get a chance to show' iu r form tin
the Derby), and'then, not being the Derby winner, she
wasn’t fancied, simply because people (outside of 8.A.)
hadn't talked much about tier before. On the other hand,
Wallace was a sensation horse all along. As soon as he
bioame a Derby winner, on-top of ins local fame and
lottery notoriety, nobody had a thought left for Auraria’s
chance.
W. R. Wilson practically warned the public in
declining to pay more titan 1.2500 straight out for Wallace
when the winning syndicate gave him the refusal of the
Derby favnrite. Air. Wilson was not the man to drive a
hard bargain under the circumstances. He wanted the
pleasure of running Wallace in iris own colors for the
races he had been hacked to win ere the St. Alban’s dis-
tribution scheme was floated. Nobody could f irm a
bet ter idea of the animal’s real value, or feel more warmly
inclined to offer a price in excess of ils value. Theretoe
when Wallace’s breeder drew Ills line of offer at £2600
and “ winning contingencies,” lie gave a vety straight
tip as to the colt’s chance of winning the Derby and Gnp
dnul le. A w -ndeifal three-yi ar-old, with his Spring
engagements oefore him, would he worth more than tiiat
to a W. R. Wilson. Years ago Donald Wallace paid
3050 guineas for young Carbine after the Spiiug meeting.
Re the way in which Derbys are run. During
the last dozen years six Derby horses h ive achieved
“ places ” for Alelb. Cup. Four of these —Alartini-Henry,
Australian Peer, Strathmore and Carnage—won the blue
ribbon in fast tim-. That is 1 1 say, the D;rby was a fair
proof of their staying power, The remaining pair—
Correze and Auraria-finished only in the fifth and third
places, respectively, for th ir Daibys, which were both of
them ru i in slower time, by ab ml ss. c., t lan the slaweat
of the other tour. Trieir staying p aver, untested In the
“ classic ” event, asseited itseif in two of the fastest Oops
on record — Carh.tie’s and Auraria’s. Tub Bulletin was
reckoning on a truly-run Derby when it predicted that
Auraria would pull off the double.
The old school of English turfmen would he dis-
posed to argue that horse-racing, as conducted by rough-
and-tumble Jockeys on circular Australian courses, isn’t
sportatall. Tnere must always be a “gloiious uncer-
tainty ” about horse contests under the best of citcum-
siances. Every result would be somewhat different, even
though the positions might not he reversed, if a race were
run over again. But racing, as we get it in this country
nowadays, is not so much a trial of merit (tempered by
legit inai e luck chances) b lween the goers, as a Inal of
luck aggravated by iccklessaiid incompetent jockey ship.
Tile first tniag a punier prays for is the safely of his
equiti • “fancy” wn n it shall, come jostling round the
turn. Fads in flat-races are incidents that bookmakers
reckon upon as a malt r of course during a big meeting.
“Is the favorite d wn?” asks jubilant ikey' Mo of bis
clerk, just as though he were belting on a steeple-
chase. Accidents are always happening. Four horses
fell, last Thursday, in the Vet ran Slakes, run over the
Derby course, and the writer, whose investment came to
grief along with The Trier, remembered bow, in days of
yore, he had seen Ids money go down with Grace Darling
in the very snne race. Which set him thinking of the
Melbourne Cup (Qleidoth’s) that Porlsea lost through a
fall—the wiiler hacked Porlsea, by the way—and then his
thoughts naturally reverted to tliis year’s Cup, wherein
Auraria, says jockey Stevenson, was nearly knocked over.
Tins sort of thing isn’t sport. It’s merely wild, farcical
gambling, with an occasional element of tragedy iu it.
Tlie “ books,” who are the best judges of racirg
performances, are unanimous iu declaring that no modern
Austialian jockey is comparable to the Hales, O Brien,
Gorry, or Donald Nicholson of a few years ago. If those
artists, or their ghosts, were to start riding again in their
best form, they would have to he sp-cially penalised.
The notice hoard would have to announce, “Number so-
and-so carries 1410. extra because Hales is up.” Probably
Stevenson, whose photo, was published iu The Bulletin
a few mouths hack, rides with more nerve and judgment
than the oilier hoys, whilst Gough Can give points to tlie
beslavered Jimmy Hayes and ot iers of the heavy weights,
hut the average standard of ability in the saddle is, un-
doubtedly, much lower than formerly.
Auraria’s people maintain that the filly’s Oaks
race, in whicn sue carried sib. more than her Derby
weight, made her own running, and look only
more than I) rby-time to win * hnndsdnwn,” proved that
her defeat by Wallace and Osculator was tile uuluckiest
of (hikes.
Bowden (J. B. Clark) doesn’t get rnucb sym-
pathy from the daily press since be dared to siing mud at
a V.A.T.C. steward. On Cup-d ,y his horse. Reconstruc-
tion, wois the victim of a starting-machine mishap in the
Van Yean Stakes. It was caught in the meshes of tlie
apparatus somehow, and was unable to get away with the
field, but never a word about tnis peculiar circumstance
appeared in tlie reports. One paper had the gall lo say
that Reconstruction’s run nit g was a “ disappoint nient.”
As a matter i f fact, the horse didn’t run at all. Tlie dis-
gusied jockey trotted it back to Ihe scales five minutes
after the w inner had passed tlie po-t. On Thursday the
ill-fated J B.C. and his R construction had considerable
cause for compl dnt against tlie rider of Mischief, who
inadvertently liit tlie Sydney horse with his whip. A
protest in this instance was debated by the V.R.C.
stewards for some time before they dismissed it.
« * * •
Very few punters have the necessary pluck to
back their fancy at what is called “a tempting price.”
Auraria was a case in point. The South Australian had
an excellent chance to win the Cnp, but the mere fact
that Ikey Mo could afford to lay 40 to 1 against her
frightened the public away. It is the short price that
tempts an unreasoning investor, not the long one.
* • * *
What sort of reception would an English
or French racing crowd {five to a Hova a horse
recently scratched for an important handicap under
such circumstances as those of the horse’s deletion
from the Caulfield Cup list —when he returned to
scale after just getting done in the race his un-
scrupulous stable bad “slipped” him for! A storm
of jeers, mi uiled with a mi.hty yell of joy, would ex-
press the popular feeling. Even the hundredsof punters
who had hacked the unlucky favorite would console t hem-
selves for the loss of their money by joining in the
“ hostile demonsi ration.” lint an Australian crowd lias
no m«-inorj for past grievances, no appreciation of a fair
pretext for a tumult, no devilry in its nature. The Hova
pot boiled over, and never a voice cried “ Hooray !’’ or
“ Amen ! ”

Trenton is the equine hero of V.R.C. Spring
meeting, having sired four winners, including Auraria,
and now as a stallion the mighty son ot Musket is pro-
bably without n peer on Hie Australian tmf. lie is worth
at least as much as Carbine, and would probably bring
every penny of £15,000 in an English sale-ring.
• » * *
Trenton seems capable of transmitting his fleet-
ness to bis female progeny —a qualification in which bis
sire (Musket) was strangely deficie t. The Musket mares
who were of any account could be reckoned on one hand
almost, and included Necklace (from old Locket) Mitrail-
leuse, and Fearlsbell. Musket sired two or three fillies
from grand old Sylvia which couldn’t have won at Lillie
Bridge.
» ♦ ♦ ♦
A dead-beat between the Derby and Cup
winners was very satisfactory as a spectacle. The grand-
stand at FI ■mington, or rather the people in it, stood up
with one accord and shouted as the two game performers
struggled past the posl. When the result was announced
the Hill and Flat clapped their hands and w'ere joyful
together. It was a fine, luif-ref resiling event—“a titling
end to the meeting,” from the point of view of W. R.
Wilson and Victorians in general. Nevertheless, Tire
Bulletin, speaking on b -halt of ils protegA l , Auraria, will
affirm that, she deserved to win ttie credit of beating Wal-
lace. Auraria was only a girl, a delicate, beautiful female
competing against two young johnnies and a man (Hcva)
in the very pdme of life and condition. She had under-
taken (o heat them on their merits. They were ex-
pected to do their level best from the slart, just to
oblige the lady, as she would repeat her Melbourne Cup
performance. But, after going about halt a furlong, the
poor girl discovered that tire three fellows were afraid to
-gallop their hardest, and so she went ahead to prevent
the possibility of a shameful fiasco. Titey gave her no
encotingemenl ; Auraria p gged away monotonously in
the leatl until the pr.cions trio of superior beings in the
rear had to he whipped to keep them from losing ground.
Oscillator first of a I, then Hova, and Wallace in
aoo her instant were under punishment, whilst Auraria
still galloped along “on her own.” She had the field
beaten a quarter of a mile from borne, worse luck for
her. Wallace, who evidently doesn’t know nkm
he’s h'aten, made a long, desperate effort to catch
the charming spinster, and came tip so fast that she
got into difficulties and couldn't show her heels to the
young gentleman any more. Had they tussled for
another quarter of a mile she would, no doubt, have worn
her redhaired relative down. Auraria, seemingly, can’t
spurt at a critical moment with the brilliancy of a Hova,
but she can maintain a certain high rate of speed for a
longer time than any male horse in Australia. Had the
D rhy and C. B. Fisher Plate been raced all the way,
like the Melbourne Cup—hut, no matter. To score a won
in the Cup and Oaks, and a dead-heat with the Derby
winner, all within five days, was not a bad record for the
little woman.
The V.R.C. Handicap, last Saturday, showed
the folly of backing horses on the strength ot their
stamina for races which are quite likely to he run in slow
(imp. Waterfall, Burrahari, and Palo Alto carried a lot
of money, and yet, nothing was sent lo ensure a pace for
eitnei of them. The victory of Onward, a speedy non-
stayer w ith a light weight up, was a wholesome pill for
Messrs. Oxenham, Purdies, and Redfearn. Ttiey liacked
their animals for a If-mile race, without taking care to get
the article required, and a six furlongs canter followed by
a mile gallop was the run they had for their money.
Oxenham’s want of foresight is unaccountable. He knows
very well that none of the good racing generals would
dispense with a pace-maker under such circumstances.
They either run one of their own, or make arrangements
to have somebody else’s horse rushed along at top speed.
The races that Hova’s owners wilfully threw
away were the Toorak Handicap and Caulfield Cup.
They were dead-birds for the speedy horse, barring
accidents. Tim Bulletin bad a paragraph re Hova and
the Toorak Handicap in type when news came that the
clever people weren’t going to run their cert.
Gigantic Sylvester Browne was conspicuous by
his absence from the V.R.C. meeting this year.
On Oaks Day it was understood that Waterfall
would have another go at Wallace in either of the next
weigbt-for-age events the Derby winner was stripped for.
The sporting penciller, dissatisfied with the Derby run-
ning and anxious to justify his confident Waterfall “ lip, ’
told W. R. Wilson that he intended to take down Wallace
anyway on the Saturday. But he changed his plans and
sent tlie little, level-backed, Caulfield surprise for the
V.R.C. Handicap, only to get beaten in a falsely-run race.
Oxenham had the worst of luck, as a hacker, throughout
the meeting.
Music, The Bulletin’s “likely outsider ’’ for
the Melh. Cnp, ran second in the Melh. Stakes, and won
the Williamstown Cup in brilliant style. Otherwise the
dark Tasmanian nag performed as though he were a
rogue, which he probably is.
J.O.T. —or Joi, as they call him now —seemed
in a fair way to win the steeplechase until he fell at one
of the last jumps.
The Parisienne, though she couldn’t get near
Aurariain the O.iks, was good enough to win the Free
Handicap on Saturday.
Strange that all the Melh. bookmakers who saw
Hop-cotch win ins races at Randwick should have come
back with such a firm belief in the super-excellence of
that heavy, camel humped animal. Quiver is another
generally over-rated gee-gee. She’s a good one, but not
a smasher.
The voice of Mossy Isaacs, calling the odds
“straight out’’ for Melbourne Cup, sounded quite
strange. O i all other days of the year old Mossy yells
“ Lay the double 1 ”
Here and there punters took “20 to 1 the
double” about either Auraria or Wallace for the C. B.
Fisher Plate, coupled with Parisienne for the next race.
Parish nne won ihe next race, and those punters, getting
half their bets, made £9 10s. profit on the sovereign.
Parisienne started at fifteens, sixteens, and twenties to
one. Laying the double is a comfortable game.
Miller’s neat little “Monthly Racing Chronicle’’
for October was ready by Derby Day tNov. 2), and sub-
scribers went to Flemingtou with the “latest form” in
their pockets.
* • • *
The V.R.C. has now raced itself out of debt.
• * • •
Wallace’s dead-beat with Auraria and defeat of
Hova, on the last day of the V.R.C. meeting, should set
at rest all doubts about his gameness and staying power.
• * * *
Melh. Cup meeting shows the tenacity of bad
luck. J. B. Clark’s hr. g. Reconstruction within one
week ran second in Coburg Stakes, Spring, and Free
Handicaps, besides finishing just behind Music in
Wibiamsiown Cup. After Devon, last year’s second for the
Caulfield, Melb., and Williamstown Cups, and Monastery,
three times “ pipped ” on the post at Adelaide Cup time,
Reconstruction seems the unluckiest horse tacing.

The Sydney Daily Telegraph was properly
"had” in its apparent "discovery” of a “two-up”
school on a large scale in the city. In its next issue it
acknowledged that the police had long been aware
of the concern, but owing to a technicality in the bet-
king-law, were unable to obtain a conviction against the
far-seeing proprietors.
The school is an ingeniously-got-np affair which
appeals purely to the larrikin class, and is run by three
people closely related to a big municipal official. The
entrance to the establishment is through a tobacconist’s
shop, where any new customer is examined and ques-
tioned before being further admitted. If the visitor is a
suspected police emissary an electric-bell gives warning
to the room above, before entry is given, when the place
will be found to be occupied as a free-and-easy club. One
individual will be thrumming on an ancient piano, others
will be boxing and using dumb-bells, and some playing
dominoes and kindred games. This little stratagem is
kept up till the M.C. asks the caller if he wants to be pro-
posed, and it he has the usual ss. nomination fee 1 A
speedy exit generally follows.
The sudden anti-gambling spasm of Sydney
D.T. was paradoxically timely. The very issue that re-
ported the running for Melb. Cup, and the glories of
Flemington Lawn, told the past speculators the variations
of the betting odds on each animal in each event, and
even interviewed the Cup-winning jockey! —that very
identical issue came down with two virtuous hoofs on the
proletarian game of “heading ’em,” under big-type
captions.

Hopscotch has quickly fallen from the pedestal
on which ids admirers placed him after his dual
victory at A. J.O. Spring meeting. The true reason for
these victories seems to be that he was able to be galloped
at Chipping Norton into good condition, whilst his
opponents at Randwick were being so hammered about
on the hard ground that they were nearly all infirm at
race-time.
• • ♦ •
The V.R.O. running of one or two of the
N.S.W. brigade caused much adverse comment, although
no official notice was taken of their “curious” perform-
ances. It will he interesting to note how they perform at
the A.J.C. Summer and Tattersall’s meeting. “ Come on
over two stone ” (in six weeks) will doubtless be the
excuse.

The handicapping at Lillie Bridge, Sydney, is
demoralising the weekly trot. To place Yankee on
scratch, and Coolgardie on 40sec. in a mile and a half,
was simply setting Coolgardie an impossible task. Yankee
D reckoned to be able to trot a mile in about 3min. ssec.
or 4min. 37|sec. forthemile-and-a-half. Coolgardie, 40sec.
behind, would have to trot about a 2.38 gait to win,
round a quarter-mile course with sharp turns.

David James, owner of the Melb. Cup
winner, Auraria, is reported to bet very moderately,
and to have won little more than the stake by
khe mare’s victory. The man who drew Auraria in
the big sweep offered to lay her owner £3OOO to i 5O, but
ne refused. As a matter of fact, Mr. James fancied the
mare more for the Derby than the Cup. His win was
popular in Adelaide, as he was one of the chief movers in
bue S.A. totalisator revival a jear or two ago.

genuine, apparently. A St. Kilda man dreamt the double
Bruin-Auraria, Caulfield and Melb. Cups, and that he
would die, which he did. All this was published before
Caulfield, llis Caulfield lip didn’t come off. Such is the
half-truth way of dreams in the experience of everyone.

Ikey Mo was cheerfully sarcastic over the Oaks
race. When Auraria came down the straight with a long,
easy lead, Ikey indulged in such phasaniries as “10 to 1
agin’ the favorite 1 ” : “ There’s generally a ‘turn-up’ for
the Oaks” : “ No depending on fillies for this race,” and
so forth.

Megson, N.S.W. champion cyclist, is counted
by his supporters the fastest man in Australia from a
quarter-mile to two miles. In condition and on a grass
track they say Megson has only been gruelled once —by
Faisons twelve months ago in the ten-mile race. But,
judged on his performances, Megson cannot last over two
miles at a hot pace, and the way the half-trained Lewis
smothered him the other day in the Goulburn three miles
corroborates previous evidence. Megson’s riding in this
race showed that all form had been trained out of him, so
this week (Nov. 9 16) Megson goes easy so as to come
fresh against Zimmerman on Saturday. What distin-
guishes Megson among cyclists is his gameness rather
than his skill. Megson’s race is a slow-run race with a
red-hot finishing spurt. He gels the chance of his life
against the imperfectly-trained Zim this Saturday.

Cyclist Parsons, who has now added to his list
of laurels the 50-mile championship of Victoria (he did
the distance in 2hr. 7min. 47see., easily beating Martin,
the Yankee, and Porloa, the Italian champion), is a
Sydney native, but has spent half his life in Melbourne,
where, three years ago, he saw- the late Harry Lambion
win the Austral for the second time. Hamilton's perform-
ance inspired the youthful Prisons to own a hike, and
when he got one he set to work with a will. In his first,
a novice race. Parsons finished second ; next time he
stepped up one, and from that time onwards he has been
steadily coming to the frent, His win of (he 50-mile
Road Race first hrou ;ht him into prominence ; then his
performance with the Victory Quartette in the Inter-Club
contest, and numerous small wins, pulled him back to ihe
20yd. mark in last year’s Austral. In that race Parsons
performed badly owing lo illness, hut in the 10 miles
championship, later in the same meeting, he created what
was possibly the greatest surprise that ever took place on
a Vic. cycle track. Paced by tandems, which he pressed
closely throughout, he twice lapped Sharp, the previous
year’s winner, and established the existing world’s grass
record. A few' weeks later, Parsons had a cut at all the
Australian records from £ to 10 miles, hell by Wally
Kerr, the Sydney amateur, and managed to lower all
substantially, on the five-lap, undished, broken-surfaced
Exhibition track. To those who know Parsons’ capabili-
ties, Zimmerman’s defeat over the longer distance, at
Adelaide, comes as no surprise, and tbeprevailingopinion
in Melb. is that on the grass track Parsons can hold his
own with the Yankee champion at any distance and at
any time. Parsons is a strongly built and handsome
young fellow, going about 1401 b. in condition, but he is
lamentably lacking in that abnormal estimation of self
essential to the champion athlete.
« * * «
Parsons’ 50 miles in 2 hours 7min. is a fine per-
formance for the antiquated Melb. Exhibition track, but
it is still far off the English record of 1 hour 56min. Aus-
tralia will not get near the world’s records until a decent
cement track, high-banked and with a good straight, is
laid down.
* * • •
What Zimmerman thinks of Parsons is best
gauged from Zim. having persuaded Parsons into riding a
Nimrod machine. Parsons was given his pick— gratis.
* * * •
Zimmerman and his manager intend snapping
all the best Australian cyclists to ride Zim.’s brand of
cycle. Two or three Australians have been offered trips
to America, and, if successful there, then on to Europe.

A grand fair in aid of those two highly
deserving charities, the Thirlmere Home for Con-
sumptives and the Fresh Air League, is to be held
at Sydney Exhibition Building from 28ih Nov. to
7th Dec. A very influential committee is at work,
and a number of important society ladies are
to officiate at the stalls. Further details will be
found in our advertising columns. T,he move-
ment merits all the public support it can get, but
the statemement, “No raffles will be allowed,
looks unlucky. Raffles may not be high-toned, but
they scoop in the dross, and dross is better than
tone.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE. Un-
doubtedly the largest buyer of opals ’ n tl,e
rough state is H. Newman, the well-known Mel-
bourne jeweller, who has been connected with
this branch of the gem trade since its inception,
and keeps a large staff of skilled lapidaries busily
employed on these and other Australian gems.
He is also a large buyer of pearls and diamonds,
and gets through an immense quantity of Queens-
land sapphires. The firm has been established
for over 40 years, and has a reputation for straight
dealing which is sufficient guarantee to con-
signors of rough gems that they will be honorably
dealt with. The establishment is still at the old
spot in Elizabeth-street, right opposite the Post
Office, and is well worthy of a visit of inspection.*
A CUP HOWL.
Auraria the winner ! Iky Mo another skinner !
For saith not the Holy Scripture: “Of the
Chosen are the Jews ” ?
And they now will keep Passover, and give thanks
unto Gee-Hova,
While the voice of lamentation fills the pulpit
and the pews.
For the ladies, perfect racing, lovely dresses and
tight lacing;
For “The Chosen,” all the shekels, both of
silver and of gold.
For the owners, disappointment—and a blow-fly
in the ointment
For the trainers and the backers, who by time-
tests have been sold.
Lo, the two Cups and the Steeple, have they not
enriched “My People”?
Clad in sackcloth and in ashes now the Gentiles
sadly mourn ;
Yet ’tis but the quaint old story, ever fresh and
ever hoary—
That he who goes to shear a Jew returneth
closely shorn.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
did fox’ the Invalid Daughter of a Prom-
inent Powell Tradesman.
“Mv daughter had for a long time been
troubled with violent headaches and sleep-
lessness. She was pale, had no appetite,
and was losing flesh rapidly. She took
various .remedies for her trouble, but ic-
ceived no benefit until she commenced using
Aver's Sarsaparilla. After taking half a
bottle, she began to feel better. By a con-
tinued use of this medicine, her appetite re-
turned, her cheeks began to fill out and show
color, she gained in strength, her headaches
disappeared, she slept better, and now says
she feels like a new person.’'—F. P. Cogges-

“ it is with heartfelt grati-

ter Gladys has derived from
*Benger's Food.’ The doctor
aiid ‘all'who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital* and the ■ author!-

Extract from a patent medicine testi-
monial advertised in a Tas. paper :
The feet were very much affected by the tickling sensa-
tion for a fortnight, also with copious sweating of same,
and disagreeable smell, so much so that I had to remove
my socks daily.
And so on. This testimonial (given in favor of a
Sydney-made preparation) is signed by a Govern-
ment official and seems to bear witness that Tas-
manian State servants habitually sleep in their
socks.
It is announced that the veteran bride-
groom Parkes’s sources of income at present com- |
prise the interest on what was originally £14,000,
viz., £lO,OOO subscribed and presented to him some
years ago by citizens of Sydney, and £4OOO, the
amount realised by the sale of his book, “ Fifty
Years in the Making of Australian History.”
Both these sums were invested, but the old man s
children by his second wife only participate in the
interest on the smaller sum. During the bank
crisis of 1893 this fortune was much depreciated,
so that now he only realises interest on some-
thing like ££ooo.

Dr. Harris, to whom Sydney University last
week gave a farewell conversazione, has been over
six years head-master of the King's School, Parra-
'matta. Dr. Harris is probably the most uncom-
promising champion for the study of Latin and
Greek to be found in Australia, maintaining, as
he does, that a good English style is almost im-
possible without the influence of these languages
as acquired by direct study. He came to Aus-
tralia at the invitation of Bishop Barry, and
retires because he thinks himself too old for the
work of the school. King’s School is a historical
institution, dating back over 60 years, and claim-
ing a large share in the moulding of the characters
of many prominent Australians.
For harmless, unexciting, cold drivel-and-
water the “ personal column ’’ of a sassiety paper
has no equal. As an example, view the following
mass from a new Maoriland publication :

STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, in the Colony of New
South’ Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows ; Whereas I suffered severely from
a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was quite unable to
attend to my business. I tried several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as
a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alkaline Vitality Pills,
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured Me within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. _ The Alkaline Pills also
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testi-
mony carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr Rassmussen. —Dear Sir, — I think it my duty to
inform you that a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by theii
use. —Yours, R. A. LUCK-HAM.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb., July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention that several of my friends
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them; therefore, T consider you are deserving of success, wmco
1 do most heartily wish you.
Yours gratefully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for yom
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper te
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of"your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfalim
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated—

whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish Fulfilled
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform you that your cele-
brated Alfaline Universal Pills cured me, when all other remedies and
doctors failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of 18 years’ standing. My

Dear Sir, I shall recommend your Alfaline Remedies to all sufferers I
come across. You are quite at liberty to publish or make what use you
like of this testimonial, and anyone writing to me will have full
particulars. I am, yours respectfully, Mrs. E. SMITH, Port Mac-
quarie, Hastings River, N.S.W.

plaint ; and that, although I am now over 70 years of age, I feel as
strong as any young man, and shall always be grateful to you.
Yours very truly, N. LARSEN.

“ Woman’s true policy is to lie low, and
let tile male imagination endow her with depths.’’
The passion for sweet scents is one which
has lasted continuously from the days of the
oldest records until now, and the demand to-day
is probably more universal than it ever was before.
The history of perfumery in modern times is prac-
tically the history of the great French house of
Pinaud and Co. It was founded in 1840, and has
grown and increased in prosperity for 55 years,
and now its perfumes are recognised as the best in
the world and its name is known in all civilised
regions to the uttermost ends of the earth.
Among the most famous of its sweet odors are
Violette de haruie, Borghetto, Prisa de las
Pampas, Ixora, and Breoni. Most of the new
inventions in perfumery come from Pinaud’s es-
tablishment —the largest and most complete in
existence —and its label has come to be recognised
as a guarantee of absolute perfection. France is
the centre of the perfumery trade, no other
country, since Italy lost its hold on the business
long ago, having even attempted to seiionsly com-
pete ; and Pinand's is the French perfumery trade
to all intents and purpes s.*

Mr. Nathan Herman, the proprietor of the
Misfit Parlor in Wynyard-square, Sydney, will be
remembered in that city for many years as the
man who struck a new idea. In every country
where man is sufficiently civilised to have his
clothes and boots made to order, there is neces-
sarily a large accumulation of garments which
have been made to tit the frame of particular pur-
chasers, who didn’t call for them, or couldn’t pay
for them, or died, or absconded, or went
mad, or got into gaol before delivery, and
so left them on the maker’s hands. And
in every case there is someone else about
whom the rejected article would fit, for
everybody’s clothes—except those of Dick Dead-
eye and the Hunchback of Notre Dame —fit
somebody else, and this person would bo glad to
get a first-class garment at a reduced price, and
the builder of it would be pleased to get rid of it
at almost any sacrifice. The difficulty always has
been to bring the misfit and the man it will fit
together, and Mr. Herman solved the problem by
accumulating in one place misfits from ail
the ends of the earth, so that everybody who
can possibly be fitted by human ingenuity
may go there and be satisfied. He is
also a universal provider—a dealer in safes,
crockery, furniture, bedding, carpets, linoleums,
oil-cloths, drapery, jewellery, watches, cigars,
tobacco, tea (401b. chest for 30s. or 121b. tin for
10s.), cutlery, fancy goods, ironmongery, &c., &c.
But the misfit idea was his own special inspira-
tion, and he is proud of it. Even the famous
£2 bale, which contains a suit of clothes, two
shirts, two undershirts, six pairs socks, two ties,
two collars, six handkerchiefs, set studs, hat, pair
braces and pair of boots, all sent to the railway
station or wharf nearest to the buyer’s residence
for 40s., doesn’t appeal to his soul like that great
original idea. Mr. Herman has lately broken out
into pianos, firearms, ammunition, and other new
departments, and makes gentlemen’s suits for
£1 9s. 6d., and supplies dress-suits at one-fourth
the usual price. Also, lie has broken out into so
many other lines of business of late that no one
knows for certain what he has got, and the things
that he iiasn’t got could mostly be enumerated on
the back of one postage stamp, and even then the
stamp wouldn’t be unduly crowded.*

Webster’s International
Dictionary .*
(“HOP," OF SYDNEY BULLETIN).
By L. HOPKINS. ESQ.
Sydney, October 31, 1895.
1 am the happy possessor of Webster’s Inter-
national Dictionary, and I need not say I am
delighted with it, so much so that I am reading it
right through. The style is somewhat jerky, but
it is word painting of the highest order. It is
hardly what you might call light literature. I
stopped at the grocer’s on my way home, and got
him to weigh it, and we found that it weighed
rather less than the present Premier of N.S. W.
There are one or two statements in the book
which I cannot allow to go unchallenged ; for
instance, on page 2011 I find the following passage
in Egyptian hieratic. Mr. Webster proceeds to
tell us;—
Nqw my recollection of the circumstance (for I
was pros nt at the time) is—
(The italics are mine). Perhaps Mr. Webster, in
his next edition, will set this very trifling discre-
pancy right. It is the only fault (if fault it be)
which I have found so far. Mr. Webster has left
nothing to the imagination of his readers, for the
narrative is enriched with thousands of illustra-
tions done in the author’s best style, and the
absorbed reader will find a picture of everything,
from a plesiosaurus to a new woman.
Mr. Webster lias produced one of the great
books of the age ; one which is worthy to go down
to posterity with “Robinson Crusoe” and
“ Trilby.”
The author spells out each word carefully, and
explains its meaning as he goes on, and it would
be well if some of our jin-de-siede poets would
follow his example. The book should be in every
schoolboy’s pocket, in every gentleman’s library,
in every counting-house, and wherever letters are
written and words spoken.
•“Webster’s International Dictionary
of the English Language,” being the authentic
edition of “ Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary,”
comprising the issues of 1804, 1879, and 1884;
now thoroughly revised and enlarged under the
supervision of Noah Porter, D.D., LL.D., of
Yale University, with a voluminous Appendix.
Published by (4. and C. Merriam Co., Spring-
field, Mass.; 40 Hunter-street, Sydney.
The Best Xmas Present.
Christmas bells will ring in family reunion.
Young and old look forward with great joy and it
is the keenest endeavour of everyone to pass this
fete in the family circle. When gathered around
the Xmas tree any absent member will be pain-
fully missed, and a sigh given for tho-e who are
away. Nothing, however, interferes with the joy
of Xmas more than if one of the family is stricken
down witli disease, and recovery to health for
such member would no doubt be most appreciated
of all Xmas presents for the whole family.
This valuable present will be found in the
timely employment of Warner’s Safe Cure, where-
by sorrow would be changed into joy. Nearly all
diseases of the human body depend upon dis-
orders of the kidneys, liver, and digestive organs,
being the laboratory for the whole organism.
Warner’s Safe Cure is a sure and reliable remedy
for the cure of these disorders, and ensures good
health.
Follow the example of Mrs, S. G. Cox, of
Pepper Grove, Bacchus Marsh, Victoria. She
says : “I was taken suddenly ill and called in
our doctor, who attended me three months with-
out doing me the least good. He then informed
me that 1 was suffering from chronic disease of
the kidneys, and that having administered every
kind ol medicine likely to be of any service, with-
out any improvement, he considered it would be
useless to continue his attendance. At that time
I was completely wasted away, and in such a
helpless state that I could not leave my bed. I
then commenced, through the advice of friends,
taking Warner’s Safe Cure. The effects which*
followed were marvellous. I can now look back
and say : ‘lf it had not been for this medicine I
should have been in my grave.’ To those suffer-
ing from kidney disease, I earnestly advise them
to give Warner’s Safe Cure a trial before trying
anything else.”*

A BUSH “DOCTOR’S” VIGIL.
Yes, thanks; when? Well then, “up to the
pretty ”;
I feel shaky. Just cut me a fill,
Took it well? Yes, she’s plucky, is Kitty.
Pali ! I smell that damned chloroform still I
Oh, / know ! “ There’s no reason to worry,”
I’ve “had many worse cases before.”
But you don’t understand, man—no hurry ;
Don’t go yet. Sit down !—open that do r !
Phew 1 It’s cursedly hot.
She’s just twenty.
She met Fergus at “ Bilby ” last year.
She’d no money, and Fergus had plenty;
They were married in August, down here.
Did you notice her pulse, how it fluttered ?
I examined her heart long ago ;
I remember the threat that it uttered
As that faulty valve clicked to and fro.
iMo, I haven’t told Fergus ; why should I ?
It could do her no possible good.
And I didn’t tell Kitty. How could I?
I’d have rather been shot where I stood !
Yes, of course ! Lots of cases pull through it
After worse times than she had last night ;
But it’s hard lines that I had to do it.
I can see her hand now, gripped so tight
On the curtain
Mack, is caffeine citrate
-Amy good in aortic regurge ?
Do you think we might give amyl nitrate?
There ! Don’t laugh, man! My brain’s in a
surge!
That last temperature—eh ? Ninety-seven?
What was that ? I can’t catch what she said
“ Mrs. Fergus is ” Good God in Heaven !
She’s dead, Mack! My Kitty is dead !

IN MULGA TOWN—A SONG.
We played at love in Mulga Town,
And oh ! her eyes were blue,
We played at love in Mulga Town,
And love’s a game for two.
If three should play, alack-a-day !
There’s one of them will rue,
Dear Heart,
There’s one of them will rue.
Three played at love in Mulga Town,
True love they could not hide;
Three played at love in Mulga Town,
Two laughed : the other sighed ;
Though two may woo the wide world through,
But one may kiss the bride,
Dear Heart,
But one may kiss the bride.
Three played at love in Mulga Town,
And one’s too sad to weep ;
Three played at love in Mulga Town—
The creek runs dark and deep ;
So warm she flows no mortal knows
How cold her dead may sleep,
Dear Heart,
How cold her dead may sleep.

“ The children of those who do not love in marriage
seem to bear an hereditary coldness.” —Thackeray.
We have a right to our father’s name,
But our lives are curst with an inward shame;
He brought to his priest-blessed union lust ;
His bride, our mother, a cold disgust.
God took no heed of a priest’s decree,
But branded our souls with bastardy.
Oar limbs are strong, and our brains are clear,
But our hearts are cold to aught but fear.
Our hearts are cold as the winter mist,
As the hearts of those ttiat loathed and kissed.
Pity us, pity, O Pate unmoved !
The children of those that never loved.
Maoriland.
O. CLYDE.
A WITHERED MUSK-ROSE.
Poor withered rose, how well I can remember
The day when first we met;
It’s full twelve years since last I opened
Horace
Twelve years, and you here yet !
Lord, how it all comes back : the lawn, the lilacs,
All nodding in the breeze,
And I, beneath their welcome shade reclining,
Head Horace at my ease.
How fair she looked, dressed how I don’t
remember—
I think it was in white—
And how she plucked you and you pricked her
finger;
Egad ! you did quite right,
’Twas rather rough to stamp upon you lying
A-withering in the dew ;
Poor little rose, and so she crushed you, did she?
Ah, well—she crushed me, too.
At least, I thought so then— prudens futuri —
It doesn’t matter now.
When we meet nowadays—ah me, the pity !
I dare not even bow.
Eheu, eheu J —to think I’m ten years married !
I’ve seen her—in the dusk,
The air around her tainted with the fragrance
Of patchouli and musk.
A musk-rose—well, poor prophet, thus I burn you,
So, God forgive us all
And keep us (if we let Him) from temptation ;
Even a star can fall!
Cue, Westralia.

A number of curious people having applied to Dr. Kirke for
the prescription nightly written by him before the audience for
restoring the shattered nerves of Mrs. Ebbsmith and also for the
bringing back to health of Lucas Cleeve after his prostrating
illness, the amiable Doctor has determined, with or without the

public the means employed. We have, therefore, pleasure in
giving the original prescription for the benefit of those whom it
may concern.

Scared!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mutfcon-birdmg was in full swing in Bass’
Straits. One morning, Davis, to whom the busi-
ness was novel, accompanied a party of half-castes
to one of the many small islands on which the
birds had made their rookeries. These places are
infested with snakes which get a fat living from
eggs and young birds. The natives, however
seem to have a special sense for locating them. ’
* * #
The party dispersed—the islanders “yank-
ing ” the young birds out with the facility acquired
by long practice. JDavis started to do likewise,
enjoying the fun. He began bis attack along the
base of a low sandy bank, from the top of which
long tussocky g ass hung over in a fringe. The
day being warm he was clad only in pants and
a singlet open from the neck downwards.
Stooping to insert his hand into a hole, he was
startled by the sudden appearance of a snake,
which, aroused from a siesta in the sun, slipped
off the tussocks aod darted into the bosom of
his singlet ere he had time to move—its rough
body brushing humbly against his bare skin.
* * #
He had straightened himself up and man-
aged to keep his head —restraining a mad influ-
ence which at first prompted him to run. With-
out any unnecessary movement of muscles he
called to the nearest of his companions, who there-
upon, by way of pleasantry, hove a bird at him,
which he did not attempt to dodge, but received
plump on the chest. “No d d fooling,” said
Davis, quietly, “I want you here.” The reptile
kept quiet; doubtless it apprecia ed its quarters.
* * #
How to get rid of it was the query. One
or two ways suggested thenvelves—but they were
risky. By this time another of the party had
joined them with his counsels. They oecided on
a plan. One unbuckled Davis’s belt and gently
unfastened his pants. The other stood ready. At
a signal the first man pulled the t ousers down—
the other pulled the singlet up. Davis made a
spring that would not have disgraced an old man
kangaroo. The snake came out as quickly as he
had entered, and was promptly dealt with. The
tension over, Davis cursed the calling for a quarter
of an hour.
He’s never been “ birding ” since !

TAHUNE LINAH.
The Game of Spoof.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Scene—Private bar in a Southern city. Time—
-1 a.m. At the counter several well-known people,
mostly in evening dress and all more or less
“jolly,” are trying to make fun—the fun of a bar
in the small hours.
Enter a tall, healthy-looking, well-built man of
some 45 years and gentlemanly appearance, but
evidently under the ’fluence. He is invited to
drink, and doesn’t say no. Someone casually re-
marks that it is time all were in bed, and another
someone adds that “ it doesn’t take him long to get
to bed when once he starts.” After a time and by
very gradual methods the last-comer is drawn
into a heated argument as to how quickly it is
really possible to undress. The stranger declares
he can do so in one minute, and is promptly called
a liar. There is a great row. Peacemakers inter-
fere and urge that money shall bo staked. A
wager of <£s is made. It takes only a few more
inflaming remarks and the stranger agrees to
prove his assertion then and there. The barmaid
is induced to retire, which she apparently does.
A stakeholder and timekeeper are chosen, and the
word is given. Wildly excited, the victim begins.
First he cuts the laces of his boots from bottom to
top. Heedless of buttons and expense he tears
off his clothes and eventually stands stark naked
before the company. He has taken 64 seconds and
lost his bet. Conspirators pat him consolingly
on the back and cheeks with purposely soot-
blacked hands, and sympathetic doubts being ex-
pressed as to the accuracy of the time, the winner
declines to take his money. Taking advantage
of the discussion some of the more mischievous
play tricks with the dupe’s clothing, tying the
sleeves of his vest, and the legs of his pants into
knots, hiding his socks, and pouring soda into his
boots. All the while the poor fellow stands nude,
and, in re-dre-sing, discards his underwear, socks
included, rather than trouble to disentangle them.
Finally, part-dressed, he leaves the heated bat-
on a chilly night and wanders home with half his
wardrobe over his arm. He dies of acute pneu-
monia, two weeks later.
This is Spoof!

“ Women have only the sense of fashion
and not that of beauty. A woman will always
find beautiful the most abominable fashion, if it is
the prevailing mode to wear that style.”—Scho-
penhauer.
Mona Caird again: “Every tender and
loving word whispered by a man into a woman’s
ear is an insult, for which, if she has any respect
for herself or her sex, she should up and slap his
face.” And Mona is married, too.

A Melb woman drowned herself recently
in El wood swamp because she couldn’t pay an out-
standing bill of <£lo. The creditor told her not to
worry about it, but the debt weighed on her illogi-
cal mind till she couldn’t live any longer. If all
Melbourne people were built on the same plan it
would be impossible to drop into the Yarra at any
hour of the day or night without landing on the
bloated corpse of some representative citizen of
high standing; and there would be a dead land-
boomer in every tank of the great smellsorne city
and its suburbs : and every time a pump refused
to work, people would remark casually that there
was another conscience-stricken banker in the
well.

The trustees of Melb. National Gallery
bought a few pictures from the Vic. Artists’ Exhi-
bition the other week. They didn’t make the best
possible selection (not, at least, in the opinion of
anybody but themselves), yet some of the pictures
they did buy strike one as being far preferable to
the mannered, pretentious works which local art-
critics would fain have rushed them into admiring.
Art-criticism in the Melb. dailies is a worship of
the unpleasing and unnatural —a glorification of
crude eccentricity and cheap conceit. When an
art-jargonist condescends to praise an unpeculiar
bit of painting that only aspires to represent the
actual, he is careful to heap his eulogy upon an
undeserving object. The Melb. Gallery trustees
bought one very weak picture of the kind which
all the world can judge. But the newspapers had
praised this obviously bad imitation of a simple
fact.

For we all of us are riders—burglar, burgled man,
police,
Lawyer, client, surgeon, patient, Premier, Justice
of the Peace,
Man and woman, judge and jury, priest and peni-
tent alike,
Have given up all other things and taken to the
bike.
And if Heaven is a country where we’re given
what we love,
Jhe bicycle must follow to those realms of bliss
above;
And when we’ve travelled upwards, it will hardly
make us smile
To see Abraham or Isaac breaking records for the
mile.
A pair of stars will help to make a heavenly
machine,
Held close in glittering splendour by a comet fixed
between ;
And the angels and the patriarchs, and saints
and all the rest,
Will ride about for ever in the mansions of the
blest.
And the souls that pass away from Earth will see
on getting there,
St. Peter first among the twelve with half a length
to spare,
And will gaze with silent wonder at the recon-
structed figure
Of a cherub sitting strad-legs on a bright and
shining jigger.

A pretty big steamer on a recent trip Up

Borbhwick, the Morning Post man, has
already fultilled The Bulletin's prediction that
he would get a coronet from his grateful sovereign.
He is now a baron or an earl. One of these days
his lamentable newspaper will render a great ser-

some rumors concerning the health of one of
Albert Edward’s grandchildren, and then Borth-
wick will be raised to a dukery.
A Chinaman disappeared in Maoriland, and
suicide was suspected. The other day a settler
found a body in the river, undoubtedly that of
the Chow, and as the hands and feet were tied
together, and a huge stone affixed to the neck,
foul play was concluded. Here was a chance for
the local “cop!” At the inquest deceased’s
brother was called to identify, but : “ Him likee
Chinaman, but him no looker like my bludder,”
said the pagan. Then the intelligent jury decided
to view the body again and pull its clothes off.
The second examination revealed that there was
no body at all. A sheepskin had been used to
make the face, which was painted yellow ; pig-
bones to make the arms, and the entrails of some
animal, probably a sheep, had been utilised in
manufacturing the body. Likewise a set of goat’s
teeth gleamed in the mouth. The language used
by coroner and jury, in front of that policeman,
was remembersome.
Dear Bcjllexin,— Re prayers for rain,
many parsons point out that we have God’s own
assurance of his readiness to break up a drought
in response to pious supplication. Please note the
Bible “proofs ” —“And the Lord appeared to
him (King Solomon) by night and said : If I shut
up Heaven and there fall no rain, or if I give
orders and command the locust to devour the
land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
and my people being converted shall make suppli-
cation to me, and seek out my face, and do
penance for their most wicked ways; then shall I
hear from heaven, and willforgive their sins and
heal the land.” It seems to me that any scheme
of Christian church religion is an impudent fraud
unless it maintains the efficacy of prayers for rain,
all church religion being based on the Bible. If
the Bible be not inspired; if God didn’t give
orders and command some person or persons un-
known to write the aforequoted (from the second
book of Paralipomenon, verses 12 —l4) bang goes
the established faith. Any sort of belief in the
Bible is inconsistent with disbelief in the necessity
for rain-praying. And when rain falls on the top
of devotional exercises, as it did in N.S.W. lately,
no religious person can accept it for an answer to
prayer without taking the conversion of the people
for granted. How contemptible is the “rational”
preacher, so-called, who takes a text from the
Bible, as being in any sense the Word of God, and
yet is not prepared to swear to the conversion of
N.S.W. ! Your squatters and graziers and city
church-goers did penance for their wicked ways,
wherefore the rain fell—or else faith in Bible
inspiration is a lamentable error, a huge impedi-
ment in the way of truth. Let us take it that
the Bible is inspired from cover to cover. The
‘ ‘ rational ” parson’s suggestion that portions of the
Book are inspired, whilst other portions are plain
worldly balderdash, is not worth considering.
We’ll say the Bible is the Word of God, We will
congratulate the recent petitioners for rain on
their having proved the divinity of the book of
Paralipomenon, which, for its part, proves the
conversion of N.S.W. people. And now I want
to know why N.S.W. has omitted to fall upon its
knees and publicly thank God for the great
national conversion revealed by the late rainfall?

WHEN THE WOLF WAS AT THE DOOR
There had been a long stretch of dry
weather, and we were cleaning out the water-hole
at our selection. Dad was down the hole shovel-
ling up the dirt ; Joe squatted on the brink catch-
ing flies and letting them go again without their
wings—a favorite amusement of his—while Dan
and Dave cut a drain to turn the water that ran
off the ridge into the hole—when it rained. Dad
was feeling dry, and told Joe to fetch him a drink.
Joe said : “See first if this cove can fly with
only one wing.” Then he went, but returned
and said “there was no water in the bucket —
Mother had used the last drop to boil the pump-
kins,” and renewed the fly-catching. Dad tried
to spit and was going to say something when
Mother, half-way between the house and the
water-hole, cried out that the grass paddock was
all on fire. “So it is, Dad,” said Joe, slowly but
surely dragging the head off a fly with finger and
thumb.
Dad scrambled out of the hole and looked.
“ Good God ! ” was all he said.
How he ran ! All of us rushed
after him except Joe —he couldn’t
run very well, because the previous
day he had ridden 15 miles on a
poor horse, bare-back. When near
the fire Dad stopped running to
break a green bush. He hit upon a
tough one. Dad was in a hurry.
The bush wasn’t. Dad swore and
tugged with all his might. Then
the bush broke and Dad fell heavily
upon his back and swore again.
To save the cockatoo-fence that
was round the cultivation was what
was troubling Dad. Right and
left we fought the fire with boughs.
Hot ! it was hellish hot ! When-
ever there was a lull in the wind
we worked. Like a wind-mill
Dad’s bough moved—and how he
rushed for another when one was
used up ! Once we had the fire
almost under control; but the wind
rose again, and away went the
flames higher and faster than ever.
“It’s no use,” said Dad at last,
placing his hand on his head, and
throwing down his bough. We
did the same, then stood and
watched the fence go. After supper
we saw it still burning from the
house. Joe asked Dad if he didn’t
think it was a splendid sight ? Dad
didn’t answer him, but walked to
and fro before the door.
# # #
We decided to put the fence
up again. Dan had sharpened the
axe with a broken file, and he and
Dad were about to start when
Mother asked them what was to be
done about flour? She said she had
shaken the bag to get enough to
make scones for that morning’s
breakfast, and unless some was got
somewhere there would be no bread
for dinner.
Dad reflected, while Dan felt the
edge on the axe with his thumb.
Dad said, “Won’t Missus
M Doolan let you have a dishful
until we get some?”
“No,” Mother answered—“l can’t ask her
until we send back what we owe them.”
Dad reflected again. “The Andersons, then?”
he said.
Mother shook her head and asked what good was
it sending to them when they, only that morning,
had sent to her for some?
“ Well, we must do the best we can at present,”
Dad answered, “ and I’ll go to the store this
evening and see what is to be dune.”
Putting the fence up again in the hurry that
Dad was in was the very devil ! He felled the
saplings—and such saplings ! —trees many of them
were—while we, “all of a muck of sweat,”
dragged them into line. Dad worked like a horse
himself, and expected us to do ihe same. “ Never
mind staring about you,” he’d say, if he caught
us looking at the sun to see if it were coming
dinner-time —“ there’s no time to lose if we want
to get the fence up and a crop in.”
Dan worked nearly as hard as Dad until he
dropped the butt-end of a heavy sapling on his
foot, which made him hop about on one leg and
say that he was sick and tired of the damn fence.
Then he argued with Dad, and declared that it
would be far better to put a wire-fence up at
once, and be done with it, instead of wasting time
over a tiling that would only be burnt down again.
“How long,” he said, “will it take to get the
posts? Not a week,” and he hit the ground dis-
gustedly with a piece of stick he had in his hand.
“Confound it, ’ Dad said, “haven’t you got
any sense, boy? What earthly use would a wire-
fence be without any wire in it? ”
Then we knocked off and went to dinner.
No-one appeared in any humor to talk at the
table. Mother sat silently at the end and poured
out the tea while Dad, at the head of it, served
the pumpkin and divided what cold meat there
was. Mother wouldn’t have any meat —one of us
would have had to go without if she had taken
any.
i don’t know if it was on account of Dan
arguing with him, or if it was because there was
no bread for dinner, that Dad was in a bad
temper; anyway, he swore at Joe for coming
to the table with dirty hands. Joe cried and said
that he couldn’t wash them when Dave, as soon
as he had washed his, had thrown the water out.
Dad scowled then at Dave, and Joe passed his
plate along for more pumpkin.
Dinner was almost over when Dan, still looking
hungry, grinned and asked Dave if he wasn’t
going to have some bread? Whereupon Dad
jumped up in a tearing passion. “D n your
insolence,” he said to Dan, “make a jest of it,
would you ? ”
“Who’s jestin’?” Dan answered and grinned
again.
“Go,” said Dad, furiously, pointing to the
door, “ leave my roof, you thankless dog ! ”
Dan went that night.
* * *
It was only upon Dad promising faithfully
to reduce his account within two months that the
storekeeper let us have another bag of flour on
credit. And what a change that bag of flour
wrought ! How cheerlul the place became all at
once ! and how expectantly then did Dad speak
of the farm and the prospects of the coming
season !
* ■» *
Four months were gone by. The fence
was up some time and ten acres of wheat put in ;
but tbere had been no rain and not a grain had
come up, or was likely to.
Nothing had been heard of Dan since his depar-
ture. Dad spoke about him to mother. “The
scamp,” he said, “ to leave me just when I wanted
help—after all the years I’ve slaved to feed him
and clothe him, see what thanks I get; but, mark
my word, he’ll be glad to come back yet.” But
mother would never say anything against Dan.
* * *
The weather continued dry. The wheat
didn’t come up, and Dad became despondent
again.
The storekeeper called every week and re-
minded Dad of his promise. “I would give it
you willingly,” Dad would say, “if I had io, Mr.
Rice ; but what can I do? You can’t knock blood
out of a stone.”
We ran short of tea, and Dad thought to buy
more with the money Anderson owed him for
some fencing hb had done, but when he asked for
it, Anderson was very sorry he hadn’t got it just
then, but promised to let him have it as soon as
he could sell the chaff. When Mother heard
Anderson couldn’t pay, she did cry, and said
there wasn’t a bit of sugar in the house, either,
nor enough cotton to mend the children’s bits of
clothes.
We couldn’t very well go without tea, so Dad
showed Mother how to make a new kind. He
roasted a slice of bread on the fire till it was like
a black coal, then poured the boiling water over
it and let it “draw” well. Dad said it had a
capital flavor —he liked it.
• # #
Dave’s only pair of pants were pretty well
worn off him ; .Toe hadn’t a decent coat for Sun-
day ; Dad himself wore a pair of boots with soles
tied on with wire, and Mother was now sick. Dad
did all he could—waited on her—and talked hope-
fully of the fortune which would come to us one
day ; but once, when talking to Dave, he broke
down, and said he didn’t, in the name of the
Almighty God, know what he would do ! Dave
couldn’t say anything—he moped about, too, and
home somehow didn’t seem like home at all.
# * #
When Mother was lying sick and Dad’s
time was taken up nursing her, when there was
nothing, scarcely, in the house, when, in fact,
the wolf was at the very door, Dan came
home with a pocket-full of money and swag full
of greasy clothes. How Dad shook him by the
hand and welcomed him back! And how Dan
talked of “tallies,” “ belly-wool” and “ringers,”
and implored Dad, over and over again, to go
shearing, or rolling up, or branding— anything
rather than work and starve on the selection.
That’s 15 years ago, and Dad is still on the farm.

The flower-girl nuisance in Melbourne has
at length reached the police courts, two flower-
sellers, aged 12 and 14 years, having been prose-
cuted for “ soliciting ” among sailors on the Zarra-
bank wharves.
The discovery in the Lachlan River at
Forbes (N.S.W.) of a bag heavily weighted, and
containing a decomposed corpse with a shattered
head, recalls two other similar finds made within
the last year or a little more. At Collarendabri a
sack was fished up containing a corpse with a
smashed head and weighted with about 2cwt. of
sand, and at Cootamundra a similar remains was
happened upon in the local reservoir. The simi-
larity of these three discoveries suggests that
an enterprising homicide who habitually puts
the remains in a bag and drops them overboard,
is at present doing a large business in N.S.W.
The chances against the resurrection of a dead
man in a bag weighted down with 2cwt. of sand
and stones, on a river bottom, are so great—pro-
vided the assassin selects his river judiciously—
that these three deceaseds may represent a very
small part of the total crop.
