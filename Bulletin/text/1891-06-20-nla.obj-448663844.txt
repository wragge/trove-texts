Beware of Imitation..—
This Blacking is in liquid form and is applied to shoes
or other articles of leather by means of a sponge, attached
to the cork by a wire, so that the blacking can be used by
anyone without soiling the fingers. No polishing brush
is required. It dries immediately after being applied, and
will not soil the most delicate clothing.
Sold largely in Australia through Commission Merchants

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hit
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
all! ict mankind.
YOUNG MEN

gressions or excesses of more nature ago, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in

fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of ' the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these rt ftlculties. On receipt of Gd. in

Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous-system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILIT Y. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1891.
An Australian Paper Currency.
The failure of the three last Australian
loans seems to suggest that the great days of
the borrowing industry are about over. The
collapse—if it is a collapse—has come with
surprising suddenness, and why it has come
no one seems to know. Possibly the British
lender has at last begun to realise that at
least three-fourths of the loans he has scat-
tered over all parts of the A\ T orld will never
come back—that every state on earth is
engaged in the borrowing industry, and
that, with one exception, none of them seem
even to dream of repayment—and that a
nation Avhich always borrows and never pays
is going exactly the same road as a man who
floats a neiv I O U every day, and never, by
any chance, settles up. Probably, he wants
digger percentage and more pickings, and
if so it is devoutly to be hoped that he may
not get them, for the percentage of the past
has been sufficiently ruinous without any
enlargement. Or, it may be, the stoppage
is only a temporary one, and that in a few
months more Australia’s promise to pay may
agjiin be acceptable tender in the money-
market of London, but this last and worst
disaster, it is to.be trusted, will not come to
pass. For the Australian people have already
lost enough by that great influx of foreign
capital which is fooled away in buying up
land for railway purposes at eleven times its
market value, and thus creating a race of
capitalists Avho go ,t° England with their
plunder and lie about this countrv at
greasy public feeds ; and if the great
borrowing industry can be brought up with
a shock it will be a blessing of no ordinary
character. But if, through his own sinful-
ness, or the wrath of Providence, or any
other cause, the British financier should be
willing, either now or at any future time, to
lend more money to this unhappy country,
it is worth considering whether the nation
would not do well to pass a law for the sum-
mary execution of any statesman who
attempts to float another loan in any foreign
market. And, having done this, the country
might sober up to some extent and forswear
the curse of imported capital so far as is pos-
sible, and fill the void—in a measure, at
least—with a Government paper-currency—
that old and valuable expedient which is
cursed by every banker on this earth,
because the banker lives to a great extent by
issuing a very questionable and shaky paper-
currency of his own, and ho feels bad in the
inmost parts of his soul when the State
threatens to interfere with his fat monopoly.
* * #
Paper-money is an essential part of the
national currency. It must be issued either
by the State or by some private institution,
for it has become absolutely indispensable.
The institution which issues it supplies an
urgent need, and while thus benefiting the
nation it also benefits itself, for it virtually
borrows the public money without paying
any interest. Yet, for some reason which
never will be accurately explained, the Aus-
tralian Governments prefer to do all their
borrowing in the London market at 3| per
cent,, while the privilege of raising money
without interest is conferred upon various
financial institutions, which make a large
part of their revenue by fooling with the
currency. This proceeding is based strictly
upon the laws of political economy, for that
science was fixed up to a large “extent by
bankers and financiers, who fixed it in the
way that was best adapted to boom their
own commissions and percentages. Political
economy is the cause and basis of Freetrade,
and the prop and stay of the alleged law of
supply and demand—whereby the cheapest
only survives, and the great object of Trade
is to replace the sweated European at 3s.
a day by the sweated Chinaman at Is. fid.
per quarter. It is the support of private
property in land and of a thousand other
swindles, and in various unfathomable ways
it furnishes indisputable reasons why the
great banking monopoly must be preserved
for the safety and security of the nation ;
and yet, when all these things are burst
up, this lying science will be re-organised,
and its professors will contradict all their
cherished axioms of the past, and will declare
that they contradicted them all along,
* # *
The one essential of a paper currency is
that it must be convertible upon demand.
The paper issued by the banks is conver-
tible, in theory at least, and, therefore, it
maintains its value with reasonable success.
In reality, however, the Australian banks, like
most other institutions of their kind, would
close their doors if they were suddenly
called upon to act up to the promise that is
printed on the face of their notes, and redeem
their , outstanding liabilities immediately.
Their safety lies in this very danger ; because
when notes are convertible there is never,
except in times of panic, any attempt to
convert them. Therefore, these institutions
trade joyously on the public money, and
gradually progress till they have a lien over
all Australasia, and they buy up the nation
with its own cash, and lend to it at high
interest the same funds which they borrowed
from it without any interest at all. Yet the
currency is obviously a matter for which the
State alone should be responsible, and the
Government which permits any practically
irresponsible institution to plunder the
people for its own benefit by the issue of
paper-money, with the further chance that
in some great day of commercial disaster the
said money will become saleable only by the
ton, is guilty of gross and infamous neglect.
If the future Commonwealth would take
this matter into its own hands, and issue a
redeemable paper currency of its own by the
medium of a State Bank, it would thus ob-
tain without interest an immediate loan
from the nation of at least £5,000,000, equal
to an annual revenue of some £300,000, and
as the population increased, and the demand
for money became greater, the amount of
this annual income would be steadily en-
larged. Out of this fund the public works
policy could be continued, much less rapidly
it is true, than heretofore, but without any
further addition to the public burdens, and
as the works thus constructed became more
and more profitable in the course of yeai’s,
progress would be accelerated in a steadily-
increasing ratio. And so far as concerns the
guarantee against depreciation of the national
securities, the note-holders would be pro-
tected in exactly the same manner as at pre-
sent. Their paper would be convertible on
demand, and the reserve of gold in the State
Bank would be sufficient to convert any
quantity of notes that were likely to
be presented. If, by any imaginable
contingency, the whole, or even a large pro-
portion of the notes, could be pi’esented in
one mass, the State Bank certainly could not
convert them, and in that case it would do
exactly what the existing banks would do
under similar conditions —suspend payment.
In the early days of the Bank of Exxgland, a
body of enterprising Jacobites bought up an
enormous quantity of notes and suddenly
dumping them down on the counter de-
manded gold in exchange, and on that
memorable occasion the institution saved its
credit by the simple process of ejecting, the
note-holders froxii the premises. Should a
State Bank be established in Australia it is
more than probable that an attempt would
be made by the present banking monopolists
to wreck it in similar fashion, and in that
event a somewhat similar device might come
in useful. Or, a more lawful proceeding,
the enterprising speculators might get three
years hard labour for conspiracy, intimida-
tion, illegal assembly, or some similar offence
which might fit the case.
# * *
A vast amount of drivel has been spoken
and written against the expedient of a State
Bank of issue, and many woeful illustrations
have been presented to show the evils that
accrue from such a scheme, but the illustra-
tions are all iri’elevant, and the. drivel has
no bearing on the case. The French
Directorate poured out depreciated assignats
until their value fell so low that a note of the
nominal value of 20 francs would barely fetch
enough to pay for paper and printing, and
the American greenbacks threatened, at one
time, to sink to the same level ; but these
and a hundred similar issues were irredeem-
able currencies, and had no more to do with
the case than has the depreciation of a pile
of wild-cat silver scrip. The question at
issue is not one of flooding the country with
paper bearing a forced and entirely artificial
value ; it is nob-suggested that the Govern-
ment should resort to the cheap and Simple
but ruinous device of printing a million
pounds worth of money wheneveiv a million
pounds is wanted in the Treasury. \lf such a
scheme were feasible no Government need
ever go bankrupt so long as the paper and
ink held out and the printing machine was in
working order* But the problem to be con-
sidered is whether the Government should
not supply by means of a State Bank the
demand which is now supplied by other in-
stitutions, and thus secure for the nation the
immense profits which now. go to pay divi-
dends to a small ring of monopolists—•
whether it should borrow money at
high interest in England while allowing
sundry capitalists a privilege by which they
are enabled to borrow money gratis in
Australia—and whether there is any more
sense or reason in allowing the paper-
currency of the country to be in the hands
of rings and syndicates than in allowing
these same syndicates to coin gold and
silver? For under present conditions the
greater part of the money in circulation has
no value at all except such as it acquires
through the solvency of certain private
speculators, and the Government has given
away a great source of revenue and got
nothing but public insecurity in return.
And, considering how much insecurity there
is lying about loose in all parts of the world,
and how cheaply it can be acquired, it seems,
in this case, as if the article had been bought
much too dear. The subject is one which
has never been put fairly before the public,
for political economy is a lopsided and lying
science which is run chiefly in the interests •
of syndicates and capitalists. Even an
irredeemable paper-currency-—though it has
no more to do with the question at issue
than Hamlet had with the Schleswig-
Holstein difficulty—is not necessarily a
greater evil than the present system may,
under certain circumstances, prove to be.
The American greenback sank sufficiently
low in public estimation, yet the greenback,
in its worst days, was more valuable than
the notes of the most solvent bank in the
United States were in 1837—that famous
year when every bank in the Union stopped
payment, and every note in circulation
descended in one act to the value of a pipe-
light.
• # »
The arguments in favour of a State Bank
may thus be summed up in a few sentences.
By resuming the sole power of issuing bank-
notes, the Government would gain a large
revenue which it has hitherto given away to
a few monopolists without getting any ap-
preciable advantage in return. It would add
enormously to the security afforded co note-
holders. It would virtually borrow to all
eternity, increase steadily with the increase
of population, and out of this money—which
now goes to create dividends for the holders
of a fat monopoly—it could continue the
construction of public works without any
addition whatever to the public burdens. It
would do this, not by laying any new bur-
dens upon the people, but by supplying a
public want which it has hitherto left to be
supplied by syndicates and corporations ; and
as a result it would be enabled to put an end
to the nefarious system of borrowing which
threatens to make Australia the property of
a gang of foreign capitalists. And lastly,
the scheme involves no risk whatever of
flooding the country with that depreciated
paper which is the cause of so much ominous
foreboding among the banking fraternity,
for notes issued by a solvent institution and
redeemable on demand cannot depreciate by
any known possibility, and the Government
would, in this respect, occupy exactly the
same situation as the banks—its notes would
be redeemable, and for that very reason they
would never be redeemed. And against the
scheme there is no ai’gument whatever,
except the universal howl of the capitalistic
press, which always prophesies ruin and
universal chaos when another great and pro-
fitable monopoly starts on that downward
road that leads to Socialism and human
equality.
Equality of Representation.
“ O N ’E Man One Vote ”is all right so far as it
goes. We approve of it, of course, that goes
without saying; for every reader of The
Bulletin knows that it has consistently
written in support of the principle for years
past, and that The Bulletin was the first
paper in Australia to advocate it. One Man
One Vote will give equality of voting power;
hut, unfortunately, even that will not give
equality of representation. Let us look at the
matter as it affects New South Wales.
* * #
An analysis of the electoral rolls suggests
quite a number of questions ; such as the fol-
lowing Why should East Macquarie, with
2600 voters, and Glen limes, with 2699, have
two representatives each, while Shoalhaven,
with 2809, The Gwydir, with 2935, and Sturt,
with 8306, have but one each ? Why should
the Glebe, with 4752 electors, have but two
members, while Mudgee, with but 4083, is
allowed three? Why should 5923 voters be
allowed to outvote 8000, 9000, 10,000 and even
18,704 ? Taking it all round, this seems like a
reversal of the supposed central principle of
representative government, inasmuch as it is
more like “government by minorities ” than
“government by majorities.”
* * #
The nine great metropolitan and suburban
electorates returning four members each, are,
taking them in the order of their numerical
importance:—Canterbury, 18,704 ; West Syd-
uey, 10,821 ; Paddington, 10,397 ; East Sydney,
10,04:1 ; Redfern, 9960; Central Cumberland,
9914; South Sydney, 9862 ; Balmain, 9780 ;
and Newtown, 8163. These nine big electo-
rates, therefore, contain 97,642 voters, out of a
total of 304,648 for the whole province, or within
a trilie of one-third of the whole; while they
return but 36 representatives out of a total of
141, or but a shade over one-fourth. That,
however, is not the worst of it. Any one of
these great electorates can be outvoted by the
representatives of not more than 5923 voters.
Even Canterbury, with its great total of 18,704
voters, can be outvoted by the combined votes
of the representatives of Wilcannia, Went-
worth, Boorowa, West Macquarie, and Morpeth,
which return one member each ; live in all,
against Canterbury’s four. Yet these five places
total blit 6,923 votes, against Canterbury’s
18,704,
* * *
Nor does it even end here. The four largest,
numerically, of the metropolitan and suburban
electorates—Canterbury, West Sydney, Pad-
dington, East Sydney—with a total of 49,963
voters, can be outvoted by a combination con-
taining Mudgee, The Murray, Argyle, East
Maitland, Glen limes, East Macquarie, Mor-
peth, West Macquarie, Wentworth, Boorowa,
and Wilcannia. These 11 electorates return 17
members, hence they are able to outvote the 16
representatives of the , four most populous met-
ropolitan and suburban electorates, but they
only contain 22,715 voters, or considerably less
than half the number contained in the four
electorates which they may outvote.
* * *
What becomes of “ government by majori-
ties ’’—nominal “Representative Government ”
—when 22,715 men can outvote 49,963? —when
5923 can outvote 18,704? —when 2600 (East
Macquarie, with two representatives) can out-
vote 8306 (Sturt, with but one’ representative) ?
What is the remedy ? Single electorates ? How
are you going to arrange your single electorates ?
On the basis of population ? Let us see how it
will work out. Total number of voters in New
South Wales, by latest returns, 304,648 ; num-
ber of representatives, 141. This gives one
representative to every 2160 (and a fraction.)
voters. No less than 22 single-member
electorates would be disfranchised, if this
were made the basis ; all the two-member
electorates—the Glebe only excepted—would be
reduced to one representative each ; four of the
three-member places would be reduced to two
each ; and Canterbury would have nine, and
West Sydney five members. The chief objec-
tion to this plan, of course, would be the total
disfranchisement of the 22 single-member
electorates. On the other hand, if the voting
power of the numerically smallest of these is to
be taken as the unit of representation, N.S.W.
would have an Assembly of 297 members; a
most absurdly excessive number. The only
way in which this could be avoided, without
disfranchising places now' represented, would be
by a complete and thorough re-mapping of the
electorates.
* * *
The only practicable escape from the double
dilemma of unequal representation, or over-
grown legislature, appears to be in making the
whole province one electorate ; but this should
undoubtedly be preceded by such a measure of
local self-government as should enable the
residents of all districts to attend to their own
requirements without reference to the general
legislature. When each county, municipality,
or other local Government was in a position to
provide for its own roads, bridges, and other
local requirements, there would no longer be
the necessity that there is now for returning
local representatives, since the mere “ roads -
and-bridges member ” would be distinctly out
of place in a Legislature that had no connection
with such matters, but attended solely to
national and international concerns. Hence it
would no longer be imperative on the residents
of Dead Dog Hollow to return to the
Legislative Assembly a representative who
w'ould support the construction of a
bridge over Dead Dog Creek at the expense of
the whole province ; but it w ould be distinctly
to the interest of the, inhabitants of each and
every portion of the province td obtain the ser-
vices of men capable of dealing with all vital
questions of general concern. Get rid of petty
local matters, and a Legislative* Assembly of 50
members could govern N.S. Wales better than
ever it has been governed by oile of 137 mem-
bers, or ever will be by 141,999, or any larger
number ; provided'that those 5() are elected bv
the manhood of the country, aiid not by mere
bricks, timber, mortar, and mud.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Our Kawlinies.”
This little paragraph, taken from the London
Hawk, is a fair sample of the hog-like bounce--
ableness of the modern Briton ;
It is lucky for us that such men as Johnnie Tools visit
our colonies; were it not so our cousins would hare a
poor idea of Englishmen of education in general and
actors in particular.
It is the terra “ onr colonies '’—that term which
glares out in every English newspaper from
Caithness to Land’s End—that amuses us.
Even the smallest kind of Englishman still
suffers from a vague and shapeless idea that he
owns the whole of Australasia—an idea that is
born of too much “ Rule Britannia ” and the
like unhealthy doggerel; and though he can’t
even raise a loaf on the security of his alleged
interest in this continent nothing ever seems to
break up his illusion. Yet England doesn’t
even own itself, and a nation that doesn’t own
itself assuredly can’t own anything else. A few
thousand landlords can give the whole English
people notice to quit at any moment, and
bounce the population of three kingdoms into
the sea, for the nation occupies its own country
solely by the landlord’s permission, and if it
suits him to fire it out it has simply got to go.
There may be no place for it to go to, but it
must go all the same, and leave behind it its
traditions, and its beloved sovereign, and the
spieling Tummy with his bagfull of gambling
plant, and its national anthem, and its glorious
memories of Cressy and Poictiers and
Agincourt and Trafalgar, and juU the rest of


the old warlike drivel of its ancestors. The
Englishman lives by exactly the same right of
tenure as a stray dog in a hogshead ; he doesn’t
own his country or his “ colonies,” or himself—
bis only property is the sole and undivided
light to move on, to the North Pole, or the
bottom of the German Ocean, or Hades, or
anywhere out of the way, when his owner
orders him to do so. He can’t even come to
his alleged kawlinies without permission, for
they are also owned by a batch of landlords ;
and not only the intruding Englishman, but
I lie Australian himself can be shifted right out
of the empire if the proprietors take the proper
legal steps to that effect. Therefore the
National Anthem, and the-“ Rule. Britannia,”,
and all the rest of the bumptious riot and
music are woefully misplaced ; they are
merely the whoopings of a lodger who
is cheering for his boarding-house, and
is liable to be- thrown down the steps
right in the middle of his enthusiasm. And he
doesn’t even own these patriotic songs, for they
arc part of the furniture of the boarding-house,
and so are the memories of Nelson and Wel-
lington, and the glories of Waterloo, and the
Charge of the Six Hundred, and everything
else that arouses the burning frenzy of the
British people. Now and then the super-
idiotic inhabitant goes out and hollers for this
furniture on some wild battlefield, and dies for
the fixtures and fittings of the national pre-
mises, but they belong to the landlord all the
same. The only difference in this matter be-
tween the Englishman and the Austral! in is
that the latter is sane enough to recognise that
lie doesn’t own Britain, while the former is mad
enough to think, without any greater vestige of
reason, that he does own Australia ; while in
reality the landlord owns both of them. He is
the only tiling connected with the whole show
that isn’t a delusion. The entire empire is a
fraud, for the landlord has legal authority to
fire out the population and leave nobody in the
empire except himself ; and the great, Imperial
army is an empty thing, for an army is no good
unless it has some place to stand upon, and the
landlord owns the place it stands upon ; and
even the capitalist—when he isn’t a landlord—
is hollow, for he has no single spot to lay down
his money upon except with the landlord’s per-
mission. And yet, in the face of all these facts,
the poor, wall-headed Briton still adheres to his
incurable delusion about his colonies ; and even
the obvious circumstance that he can’t stand on
any one of these colonies or on his own native
country cither, unless he gets permission to do
so and pays for the privilege, doesn’t seem to
explain the situation to him in the least.
Circus and Red Faint.
Brettv nearly all the cranks on earth seem to
be writing to the Argus just nowon the subject
of Federation. Most of them are writing about
the Commonwealth flag and the wattle, and the
bine Australian sky, and things like that, but
one advanced individual has another grievance.
In addition to the flag he wants this nation to
•adopt a symbol of some kind^an ivy leaf, he
thinks, would crowd up the yawning void as
well as anything—which symbol the inhabitants
of this country are to —
Wear on all occasions, in order 'that the manifestation
‘of a well-grounded enthusiasm may tend to assist the
‘deliberations of our legislators.
The Australian Natives’ Association crank
'sticks out conspicuously in this suggestion, and
unless the A.N.A. crank can be suppressed he
will end by making the Commonwealth ridicu-
lous. The Australian of the future is not going
to wear a vegetable on all occasions in order to
manifest enthusiasm, for no nation can enthuse
and whoop and pass resolutions all its life. The
A.N.A. has got an impression that when Aus-
tralia is federated the inhabitants are going to
•hurrah and let off rockets for ever afterwards,
but they are not —they will have to go out look-
ing for a job in the same sad, old way, and beer
•won’t be any cheaper, and rents will still go up,
and the drains will smell exactly the same, and
the European pauper will want to come here
.just as he does now. And the Federal legislator
won’t be “ assisted ’ in his deliberations by the
ipopulation wearing a leaf, any more than we
'will by the population wearing clothes or carry-
ing a saw—the kind of legislator who could bo
■assisted in any such way isn’t worth baying,
•anyhow ; and moreover it would be exceedingly
•rough on the Australian inhabitant, for he
anight lose his leaf when he was eleven miles
from home, and then he would have to walk
back and get another one, lest he should meet a
legislator, and the legislator should feel
Weakened and discouraged through seeing him
Avithout the symbolic herb. The A.N.A. has
fione a lot to create a national spirit in Aus-
tralia, and it would have been better if it had
left the job alone, for it has roused a lot of
tp&hriotic enthusiasm which isn’t worth having.
The details of Federation are left pretty
much to take care of themselves, and
while the imported groveller fixes up the
constitution of the Commonwealth in any way
that best suits his hunger after titles and mis-
cellaneous “honours,” the Australian “native
worries about flags and emblems and symbolic
vegetables, and makes weird whizzing noises
about his great continent, and barracks for the
cause of Unity, and devotes himself to rockets
and processions and other childlike lunacies. In
reality it doesn’t matter one solitary rap if
Australia never has a flag at all—a country can
pull through without a flag, and the sort of
patriotic fire that won’t blaze up except when
a garish rag is put up on a stick is exactly the
same sort of enthusiasm which is aroused bj
the sight of a cow with five legs, or a burst of
green and blue fireworks, and it isn’t worth
storage room. Also, the uniforms, and the
illuminations, and the processions, and the
drink, and the miscellaneous howling which
somehow grow up around every great national
movement are all absolutely useless —they are
not patriotism or devotion or any other thing
that is valued at one cent. But the typical
politician always encourages this mixture of
circus and red paint, because it diverts the
•attention of the nation and leaves him to fake
t he constitution in peace. He promotes banners,
and doggerel “National Anthems, and dis-
plays of troops, and the firing of big guns,
because they induce the people to mistake aim-
less whooping for liberty and equality, and it
is on this basis that the Commonwealth is likely
to be constructed. The imported placeman and
place-hunters are fixing up the foundations of
the new State, and the Native—that hunible
native who is always left out when the loaves
and fishes are going round—is uttering plati-
tudes, and barracking in the background, and
because he is allowed to barrack ho imagines
that he is running the country —but he isn’t.
He is only shaking a rattle, and banging a toy
drum, and making a show of himself,

Wanted, a Government Auditor.
The other day, in Melbourne, Mr. Edward
8000, who pleaded guilty to a £lO,OOO shortage
in his cash, was brought up for sentence, and
Pitrves, Q.C., arose, with tears in his voice,
and great hunks of pathos bursting out of him
in all directions, to whitewash his client, and
plead for a mitigation of sentence. And in the
course of about half-an-hour, he virtually proved
that Mr. 8000 was the only really straight man
going ; he was morally, if not legally, square ;
he was wool all through; and, in a general way,
he was a pillar for rectitude, and nothing but
the cussedness of the auditor was at fault:—
The main inducement to the crime was the extraordinary
want of supervision and carelessness of the directors,
manager, and auditors of the company. It excelled even
the Premier Permanent cases. Government would have
to appoint a Government director and a Government
auditor for each financial company, who would be entitled
to demand an audit at any time, and would he criminally
responsible for any neglect.
This was a remarkable utterance in its way,
because it was left unfinished. It ended just
there. There was no suggestion about arresting
the auditor for stupidity or neglect or on any
other charge, for somehow nobody ever does
arrest an auditor. Nearly every company in
Australia gets into trouble periodically because
somebody has been “faking ” the accounts and
the cash, and the blamed ass of an auditor
either is in the swim or has not had sense
enough to find it out : and the only remedy that
is ever proposed is to appoint an expensive
Government official—one separate Government
official to every company. The cost of such a
functionary would wreck any small enterprise,
and the chances are a hundred to one that he
would be a shade worse even than the unofficial
incubus now existing. And, moreover, if a
Government auditor could he made criminally
responsible, why not make the present auditor
criminally responsible in like manner ? When
some great institution breaks up, and £lOO,OOO
dissolves into thin air, the shareholders are
ruined because they paid an outside officer to
watch the principal hired swindlers , inside the
office, and he scooped in his salary under false
pretences ; therefore, he ought to be promptly
run in on the same criminal charge as the man
who raises the wind on a bogus cheque, or else
he should be tried for negligence and derelic-
tion of duty. His position is practically the
same as that of the individual who loses a
£lOO,OOO steamship, and the law jumps on him
remorselessly. No one can reach the man
whose foolishness has sunk a bank, so long as he
was only stupid and incompetent, but for
the man who has sunk a ship—even though no
lives have been lost and there is only the
financial aspect of the case to be considered —
stupidity and incompetence are actual crimes
and are rightly treated as such. The cause of
this difference is easily explained. The Legis-
latures of Australia are mostly made up of
financiers, speculators, directors, and company-
mongers, and most of these individuals are, or
have been, or will be at some future time,,
engaged in more or less questionable dodges,
with money entrusted to them by shareholders.
An auditor who was compelled, if only in order
to keep out of gaol, to be a reality and not a
sham, would furnish a snag on which half the
law-makers of this country would founder. The
proposition for the appointment of a race of
Government auditors implies that by no other
means can any individual plant his savings in a
bank or a building society without imminent
risk of being reduced to beggary, and it would
be equally reasonable to assume that no one
could safely go on board ship without a Govern-
ment official in command, or ride in a cab
without an expensive Civil-servant to drive.
And such a proposition, in the eloquent words
of Duncan Gillies —a man whose surpluses
were very much in want of auditing—is too
thin.
The Baccarat Case.
A jury has decided that Sir William Gordon-
Cumming cheated at baccarat, for the sufficient
reason that four people swore they saw him
cheat, and nobody but himself could possibly
swear to the contrary. The gallant- officer
was at a disadvantage which put him out of
Court before the case commenced. Any
witnesses for the defence would count for no
more than the folks who don’t see a conjuror
put the cannon-ball in the obliging gentleman’s
hat. CuMMiNtt’s counsel —who, by the way,
is a professional Tory and place-seeker —took
precious good care not to injure his own politi-
cal prospects by advancing the only arguments
likely to benefit his client. He feebly suggested
that the addle-pated snobs who saw the hanky-
panky perpetrated, again and again, mustall have
been mistaken. A smart young barrister with his
way to make, and no ‘ ‘ society ’ ’ standing to main-
tain, would have boldly suggested live things.
First, that the entire company, from the royal
banker downwards, were drunk and incap-
able of swearing to anything that occurred.
Secondly, that the oath of a woman in any
gambling transaction is incontrovertible evi-
dence to the opposite of what she states, and
that she cannot possibly speak the truth where
money is at stake. Thirdly, that Gumming
only did what he saw his accusers doing when
they got the chance, and therefore supposed
that his cheating was of a venial character and
made no difference to the “honour” of an
officer and a gentleman, which is elastic.
Fourthly, that the host and his family who
would, on their own showing, continue to
offer hospitality to a petty swindler (who had
the cheek to try and swindle such old case-
hardened roues and past-masters of gambling
as Wales and Williams by a most transparent
device under their very noses) and en-
courage him to play baccarat for the express
purpose of seeing him swindle under their own
roof—that such people were not good enough
to swear away the character of a bull-frog.
Fifthly—that the Wilson crowd, the Earl of
Coventry (Beerthirst’s papa), General Wil-
liams and the Prince of Wales had all
conspired in a course of conduct which proved
them to be rogues if they were not fools, and
mad if they were not drunk. And then the
jury would have found for the plaintiff against
each defendant, adding a rider to the effect that
Tummy was guilty of carrying the implements
of gambling in his trousers pocket,' but might
be released on the Queen’s recognisances until
an Act of Parliament was passed on his behalf,
o-
Anti-strike prophecies were numerous that, as
soon as the Unionists were “ downed,” the
Employers’ Associations would take an un-
generous victor’s remorseless grip of the throat
of Labour and start reducing wages all round.
Brisbane Master Printers’ Association (some of
whom are employing excellent reporters at £2
per week) is the first squeezer to assert itself,
doing so in the belief that scores of unemployed
compositors are to be found in Brisbane, and
that the local Typographical Association has
neglected to sufficiently enlarge its membership
to withstand a “cutting-down” move. The
master printers have notified that, from and
after Ist July, they will reduce their pay-rates
to ;
Newspaper piecework, per thousand—Day-work, Is.;
night-work, 13d. Stab rates—7os. per week on morning
papers, and 555. per week on the evening papers and in
jobbing offices, with a proportionate reduction of rates
tor overtime.
This represents an all-round reduction of Id.
per thousand in piecework, and of ss. per week
wages. In the eyes of a corpulent syndicate,
£3 10s. a week seems a magnificent reward for
continuous all-night work involving the impair-
ment of health. If the Brisbane Typographical
Union attempts to combat this gratuitous,
greed-impelled attempt to reduce wages, the
Master Printers, if they are true to the tradi-
tions of the Employers’ Unions, will have the
unadulterated gall to rise up and declare that
the compositors started the strike, that they
had been for months organising it, and
that the masters are acting purely on the de-
fensive, for the glorious principle of “ freedom
of contract ” and for the hallowed right to con-
trol their own businesses.

The population of Ireland is still declining. The
present census shows about half-a-milliou less
inhabitants than did the last one, and the
total returns are now something over four
millions—just about half what they were half a
century ago ! The world in general is filling up
fast and people are swarming to Africa, .Aus-
tralia, and South America, but though Ireland
is more fertile, and more beautiful, and
probably more healthy than either of t he three,
nobody wants to go there, and everybody wants
to get away. The blessings of British rule
have made Ireland almost the only place on
earth that no human being will live in,
if he can find any other place to go to.
Even in Poland, Turkey, Spain, Mexico,
and similar countries which Englishman holds
up as models of hideous misgovernment, popu-
lation keeps increasing, which is a sufficient
proof that these lands are at least habitable,
but Ireland is practically uninhabitable. Not
even a billion tons of Tory drivel about the
happiness and prosperity of Ireland under
British coercion can weigh against this one
unanswerable fact of the ceaseless decrease of
the Irish population. No nation ever yet rose
up to make a unanimous exodus from a land of
liberty and happiness ; lands of that description
are scarce, and if Ireland was even one-tenth as
well-governed as the British Tory asserts, t here
would be a continuous influx of population from
other countries, instead of a continuous over-
flow.. The British Christian has probably ex-
tinguished as many conquered nations as any
other Christian on earth, and about fifty years
-more of tyranny, landlordism, snufflebusting,
and hypocrisy, will add one more to the list.
Them the last of the Irish people will have
vanished into some other continent, and be
absorbed by some other race, and the English
policeman will prowl through the great desert
of Connaught and find nobody to arrest, and
the English landlord will howl throughout
Leinster and find nobody to evict, and the
English magistrate will lose Ids job because
there will )>e nobody to hang, and a great claim
will pervade .the whole land of Erin.
The following is an interesting extract from a
book, recently published,in England :
The first tendency we .notice of the military profession
is that it makes a soldier more, or less a machine. “His
■not to reason why, his hut to do and die.” To be “ lord
of himself” is often, as Lord Byron found to Ids cost, a
“heritage of woe ” to a man, and it is not a bad tiling for
him to be wound up like a clock and made to go right;
hut this winding-up process converts him into, it may be,
:a noble machine, but a machine still. Nearly everything
which a soldier does he Is ordered to do. He is put down fol-
ia new pair of boots or tunic without being asked whether
he wants them or not. His dinner conies to him as though
it were manna from heaven. He is told when to get his hair
■cut, and when to put on or take off the several parts of
his outfit. At length lie ceases almost entirely to think
for himself, and puts childlike trust in the “Queen’s
Regulations.” Poor Tommy I I have seen him standing
for nearly an hour at a railway station, keeping all the
time a heavy valise on his back because no one told him
to take it off, and lie could not himself originate enough
thought to do so. On Christmas Day an old soldier was
•carrying a plum-pudding from the cook-house to his
barrack-room. A sergeant who happened to bo behind
him shouted out in joke, “ Attention 1 ” Down went the
hands of this creature of habit to his side, and down went
the dish.
No wonder the imported British loyalist pines
for the day when Australia will own a big
standing army of its own. For the true and
genuine soldier is impervious to unpleasant
doctrines about independence, human equality,
socialism, and the dignity of humanity—-just as
impervious as a threshing-machine or a boiler,
and from exactly the same cause—and his want
of thinking capacity keeps him going straight
ahead all the time.
In the British House of Commons, a few days
ag >, some rampant iconoclast brought forward
a motion for taxing the ground-rents of London,
and thus compelling the pompous British
millionaire to contribute a trifle to the revenue,
and, strange to say, the Tory party only mus-
tered a majority of 26 votes to throw out this
ni revolutionary project. Evidently, even the
i slow-going Parliament of England has some-
capacity for better things, and sooner or later
something is going to happen te the British
landlord. The ground-rents of London now-
amount to fifteen millions per annum, and they
are increasing with such amazing rapidity that
another generation will sec the annual total
raised to £30,000,000 or more. Most of this
represents steals pure and simple that is to
say, that neither the present owners nor their
ancestors paid a solitary cent for the property,
Some ancient king stole'it from the nation, and
gave it away to the principal shady female of
his harem, generally for no reason save thfit the
recipient ought to have been hanged, and the
king should have been hanged also! Neither
the shady female nor her descendants 'effected
any improvements on the land, and, therefore,
£15,000,000 per annum is merely the charge
which is levied on the people whose presence
has given value to the land, for the privilege of
making the said land valuable. The riot pus
and insurrectionary proposal, that a dead king
and a dead harlot are not sufficient reasons for
paying all this money, is no doubt a lamentable
surprise to the British landlord, and when the
Tory scrapes through by 26 votes only, things
are hot so promising as they used to be. But
the British duke can seldom sec anything that
is further removed than the point of his own
old-port-tinted nose, and probably it never
occurs to him that, in another generation, a
shouting mob may hang him, feet-uppermost,
on a clothes’-line, and keep him there till all
the millions of his unearned increment drop out
of him, and then shake him by the heels on the
edge of the pavement till they shake the title-
deeds off him. Yet something like this is
coming, even if the title-deeds have to be blasted
out of the landlord with dynamite.
The Duke of Westminster is refusing to renew
the expired leases of pubs, on his J/mdon pro-
perty. As this rich man practically throws
away the value of .the license each time he
wipes out a grog-shop, fie has some hollow pre-
tensions to assume virtuous frill op the subject,.
Yet, allowing that he is acting for what he con-
siders “ the good of his masses," it is obviously
scandalous that any private person should have
the power.to bar any authorised tradeover a
jlargc tract of densely-populated earth. West-
minster, in fact, is merely giving a respectable
illustration of the great landlord evil. He
has no more niqral right to abolish publicans
with a stroke of bis agent’s pen, than a vege-
tarian duke would have to decree, in the same
.way, the suppression of butchers. A future
"Westminster may easily become—unless some-
thing happens in the meantime —the owner: of
all London, and exclude doctors from his
estate, on the ground that they are, as Tolstoi
maintains, the root of all social'evil. Even as
matters stand now it is possible for a small
clique of titled London autocrats, 'of. a” few
dozen heads of county families, to starve out
the metropolis, or reduce the rustics to shadows,
by forbidding their tenants to keep any descrip-
tion of shop. Again, by a preconcerted arrange-
ment of leases the noble ring could shut up any
number of factories and generally play Sheol on
a given date, just as they can, and do occasion-
ally, close down coal mines here and there.
This ostensibly moral behaviour on the part of
Westminster will surely attract some more
nasty radical attention to the immorality of the
system which sanctions it. His legal right to
close a public-house is no less shamefully wrong
than is the right of that bloated “sport,” the
Duke of Hamilton, to prohibit, as he did pro-
hibit a while ago, a certain religious sect from
erecting their little tabernacle on the Isle of
Arran, or some such place, where he holds the
fee simple in everybody’s soul.
Professor Lawbie, of Hyderabad, declares
that deaths from chloroform are really due to
the improper rjiethod of administration. He
contends that Same’s method, which Lister
subsequently sanctioned by adopting, is almost
absolutely safe. Under this system tlie respira-
tion only is attended to, while in the ordinary
method the pulse as well as the respiration is
watched. Lawbie concludes “ that the appli-
cation of chloroform in ordinary cases is almost
criminal unless Same’s method is followed.”
He claims that chloroform has been given in
this way by him and his students many thou-
sands of times without a single fatality, and
refers in support of his position to the Commis-
sion appointed by an Indian Prince, which,
carrying out experiments on animals, demon-
strated that chloroform kills dogs by paralysing
the respiration, never by paralysing the heart.
Needless to say the result, conflicting as it did
with English views, was not accepted in
London, and another Commission was accord-
ingly appointed, to which the Lancet sent out
a member. The Lancet man held the conven-
tional view as to the action of chloroform upon
the heart; but the investigation occasioned a
reversal of his opinion. For this paragraph a
Melbourne Professor, holding University office,
is responsible, and we would just like to know
now, speaking as laymen what the doctors who
are associated with two or three late unfor-
tunate occurrences have to say on the point.

Cablegram: —“The Regent of Manipur and
the Seniputti or Commander-in-Chief are to be
tried on the Ist June. The prisoners will be
allowed the assistance of a British officer in con-
ducting their defence.” The prisoners’ country
was invaded by British officers who came to
haul down the Government and construct a new
one. They were shot at by British officers, and
killed some of these same officers in return, and
then they were arrested by more British officers,
and British officers have annexed their country,
and finally they are to be persecuted by British
officers and judged by British officers. Also
their defence will be conducted by British
officers; and as the only defence they can
make is that no British officer had any right
to be in their country at all, and.as no British
officer could advance such a defence without
getting iuto trouble for mutinous language and
high treason, they won’t really be defended at
all. And, finally, they will be shot by British
officers, and the inscription oh their tombstones
will set forth that they died of too much British
officer, and they will depart to run up against
red-hot British officers in Gehenna.


To the Australian Labour Party.
Fellow Malcontents : — The present social
order is bad. We are agreed upoxx that. It
must be changed. How are we going to change
it, and to what? We all have our plans of
x eform ; evex-y one of xxs carries ixx his pocket a
scheme that only wants “ be it enacted ” at the
head of it, and an authorisation signature at
the foot of it to regenerate the world. But the
li-ouble is to get the signature. Your signature
and mine, beloved brother, would ho no more
use there than, alas, they are at the bottom of
a cheque. If this country were a despotism,
and we were the benevolexxl despot, wc should
want no endox-sement. But seeing that it is a
democracy, our paper is xxo good unless wc can
get the people to back it. Doxx’t lose sight of
that fact. The country doesn’t believe ixx yoxxr
scheme or mine ixx its entix-ety. If the country
did, yoxx and I would no longer be advanced
Ihixxkei-s. We should think what everyone clso
thinks. The coxmtry will not accept our
schemes until we make it believe in them.
That is a long job and a big job. It is no uso
trying to force the new social ox-der down the
throats of the people in the lump. But there
is no reason why we shouldn’t do it piece-meal,
# # *
The business divides itself up into two depart-
ments. First we must make the people believe
that a thing ought to be done ; thoxx we must
make Parliament do it. First advocate, then
legislate. The order must not be reversed.
The work of Parliament commences where the
wox-k of education finishes. To talk in Parlia-
ment about unpopular reforms is a waste of
onex-gy and a waste of time. There is plenty of
work for the man who will set himself to carry
out popular reforms. Make for yourself a xnap
as clear as you caxx of the existing constitution
of society, then make another of that coxxstitu-
tion which yoxx desire to substitute and which
yoxx have in yoxxr mixxd as axx ideal. The differ-
ence between the one we have and the oixe yoxx
want is the grouxxd that you have to, cover by
reform. A good deal of it you will find has not
been accepted by pxxblic opinioxx—people don’t
believe ixx it. As to that your present business
is only to educate. You must begin by making
people believe iu it. But a great part is sure
to remain xxpou which you will find everybody
in, agreement with you-, or upon which, at any
x;ate, yoxxr Opponents will be few. That is the
sphere of legislation. It is a battle-ground oxx
which yon must succeed, if you only know how
to, manage your forces.
* *
It all lies ixx the management.. The mistake
w.e make is to mix up what we want the people
to, believe with what they do believe—the
measures w.e want them to approve of with the
measures we and they want Parliament to pass.
When the bixlk of the people are in favour of a
particular course, the man who advocates it ixx
Parliament, has an irresistible power behind
him,; but if he couples with it some private fad;
of Ins own, he simply fools away his chaxxce.
\yhei; Parkes 'wanted) to make sure of the
defeat of a xnqasure of electoral reform —the
abolition of, plural voting—that he had to
firing in,against fiis will, he incorporated in it
tjxe principle of woman-suffrage. Tfie whole
Bill was then.bound to go by the board, and the
crafty old man kxxew it,; not necessarily because
woman suffrage is a bad thing, but because
people are not yet educated np.'tp it. What
Parkes did oxxt of guile, the average social
reformer does every day out of mere softheaded-
ness, Not satisfied XYith taking the nuts out of-
the jar one by one, he tries fox- a fistfull and
ends by getting nothing.
When we have made up our minds \y hat we
want tp do, it remains to settle how it is to be
done, Hpw are those of you who get into
Parliament to, act? Whichever party comes
into power as the outcome of the elections—P
am ,speaking now with an eye particularly to
New South Wajes—there will be no attempt on
the part of the Government to deal with any
big social question. Neither Parkes nor
Dibbs will lift a finger, for example, to touch
the relations between labour and capital or to
diminish by a feather-weight the power of
privilege and vested interests, unless forced to
do so. The business of the real representatives
of the people is to force them. There is one.
way in which that can be done if you are united
enough and fairly resolute. It is in substance
the way that a numerically insignificant Irish
party has Dreed an English Parliament into an
attitude o( deferential, though occasionally
mutinous, civility. Here difficulties would not
be so great as those the Irish party had to face.
Against, them were arrayed the racial and
religious prejudices or the stupid indifference of
a nation ; you would have the bulkof the nation
at your back. '
# # #
Organise, then, and lay your plans. Agree
upon some definite and feasible instalment of
ref firm, and pledge yourselves to put it through.
You can do it if you will. Twenty of you could
make yourselves absolutely masters of the New
South Wales Assembly if yon banded yourselves
together' with one single object, and let nothing
under Heaven turn you from it. You would
hold the balance of power, and every Ministry
would be at your mercy. Let the Government
know plainly the price of your support. “ The
Bill—or your life.” To the Government that
will give you your Bill, and push it through,
sell yourselves unscrupulously, like a regiment
of Swiss or Hessians. If you would attain free-
dom by means of parliamentary Government,
you must conform to parliamentary usages. In
war the soldier merges his individuality, in the
regiment; in the parliamentary battle the
individual must sink himself in the party. If
your conscience won’t stand it, stop out. There
is another road to reform open to you—red
revolution. Let your conscience choose : there
is the bloodless parliamentary method on the
one hand—on the other, dynamite and barri-
cades.
# # #
Do you want reform, or do you not ? If you
do, you must take the means that are at your
hand. “ Do evil that good may come?” Yes,
my Christian friend, precisely, if the only
alternative is to do good that evil may continue.
Wholesale murder is a crime, even when it is
gilded with the name of war; but if it saves a
nation’s freedom, it needs no justification. The
protectionist who votes against his conscience
for freetrade may feel pretty mean over it* but
if he gets in return a Factories Act that will
save thousands of little children from being
robbed of their youth, he can hold up his head
without a blush in the presence of the strictest
Pharisee who gives voice for the perpetration
of infant slavery, and keeps his conscience
clean. “ Paris, said the Protestant Henry of
Navarro, “ is well worth a mass,”
# * #
With a practicable policy, a close organisa-
tion, a good general and plenty of determina-
tion, yon might do great things. You
mu*/ renounce office and the hope of office. Every
man of you should he pledr/ed to take no portfolio
either in the, existniy Ministry or the ensuing one.
In that respect your votes, whether to keep a
Government in or turn it out would be equally
disinterested, The loss you talk the bettor.
One spokesman should at almost any time be
enough for a body of men representing only one
idea, t The powerful party in Parliament is the
party that votes in a dumb phalanx. It would
be easy to enlarge upon this topic, but it is
quite unnecessary, None of these suggestions
arc new, Everybody who knows any-
thing of Parliamentary life knows they
embody the one way that has yet
been found effectual to overcome the dead-
weight of parliamentary indolence and dis-
inclination for reform. It is only by adopting
some such plan that members who are returned
on the strength of democratic professions can at
once give evidence of their sincerity and sub-
stantially advance the popular cause. Without
organisation the men who belong to the party
of progress are absolutely useless in the legis-
lature. They might as well save their breath,
or turn it to more profitable account hawking
newspapers. They are voices crying in the
wilderness. Now, where is the organiser?
Where is the Australian Parnell? —Yours,
I NTH A N SIGEAN T,
The United States Congress has decreed that
in future no idiot or diseased person shall be
allowed to enter the republic either by land or
sea, nor shall any foreign criminal, “reformed”
or otherwise, any pauper or person who- seems,
likely to become a pauper, or anybody whose
passage has been paid for him, either in whole
or in part, be permitted to land on American
territory under any pretext whatever. And, in
addition to this, Congress is seriously consider-
ing the desirability of putting a heavy tax on
all immigrants—such a tax as shall practically
wipeout immigration for good and all. The,
great pauper-exporting business is about played
out, and it is time it were, for a meaner swindle
never existed. It was never anything more
than the old game of throwing your dead dog
over into the next man’s yard, and now the
next man is starting to throw the dog back
again. The English papers- are using very
strong expressions about this new American
legislation, but that was only to be expected

across the fence in the first place always pro-
fesses to think that the man next door is fond
of dead dogs, and hag been pining for the beast
all along, but when his neighbour whizzes the,

Item, full of> hidden significance; from the:
Queensland papers :
At the Charleville police court to-day sjx unionists were
fined>£2s each or,five months’ imprisonment, for having a
quantity of fresh mutton in their possession for which
they were unable satisfactorily to account; also for having
a quantity of kerosene with which it was, suspected they
intended to commit a felony.
The Bulletin foretold several weeks ago that
Queensland unionism, would presently come to.
grief over this .fine old law, and the prophecy is.
coming true. No doubt the-magistrate who,
passed the sentence has also got kerosene in his
possession, and to a dead certainty .he is also,
possessed of property for which he can’t- satis-
factorily account* for nobody ever can bring
forward indubitable evidence that everything he,
owns was lawfully acquired; but then nobody,
will ever issue a warrant against the magistrate,
on that pretext. And' when some of the
unionists are. arrested for “ conspiracy,” and,
some more for refusing to “ move on,” and
another lot are run in for standing or sitting,
somewhere, which will be defined as “ unlawful
assemblage,” and a fresh batch are taken for
trespass, and a few hundreds are sent' to gaol
for having their own property in their possession,
the same being “reasonably,suspected,’’without,
a shadow of evidence, of being stolen, and a,
whole crowd are jugged for being somewhere,
with the supposed intention of committing a
felony, and finally the Riot Act is read to the ,
rest and they are trodden on and, crippled by
the troops before eah get .out of the road —
then there will,be very little of the great .strike,
left. For among the old brutal class laws which
no one has sense or energy enough to repeal,
there are statutes enough to authorise, tire, arrest
and imprisonment, of every working-man in
Australia whenever, any fool > of a magistrate,
sees fit to issue a warrant to that .effect,

At Sydney Garrick; the Oharringtons
abandoned “ The New Magdalelx ” on Wednesday
of last week for Pinex-o’s “The Money-Spinner,”
a tale of card-sharping, fair and innocent decoys,
seedy touts, true love and tommyrot; a play of
considerable change and much merit, not new and
yet not familiar to Sydney playgoers. Janet
Achux-ch, in the title rdle, was a pleasing example
of filial obedience overmastered by sweethearting
devotion—the sort of best girl who doesxx’t mind
outraging her xxatural instincts and bheatixxg at
cards to save her embezzling husband fx-oxn gaol.
Her acting was natural, vivacious and, in the
emotional parts, intense. Emma Bx-onton, as
Dorinda, the slangy sister of the Money-Spinner,
was the sort of jolly girl no fellow would
mixxd takixxg to a picnic, and her jealousy never
took a tragic hue. Meta Pelham, as Margot,
made much of a minor part. Charles Charringtoxi,
as Baron Croodle, was a boistei'ous impersonation
of that chattering old adventurer, but his mock-
seixtiment had xxot the slightest semblance of even
assumed geuuiness, while his rigidity of deliver -
axxce marred his best efforts, Herbert Elernming,
the honest noodle, Lord Kengussio, was natural,
even, and always well within himself, evincing
a highly commendable power of self-restraint.
H. R. Jewett, as a commonplace lover axxd
pardonable villain, was not the success that
he usually is when he poses as a cynical,
cold-blooded and irredeemable scoundrel; but he
pleased the audience nevertheless. Harx-y Power,
as the mysterious detective, “ the Ferret,” was
painfully painstakixxg; and Cosgrove, as the
tout, did justice to his small part. “Adrienne
Lecouvreur,” one of Sara’s pet parts, goes up on
Thursday (18th) and, with “The Doll’s House,”
will fill the bill until June 27, when “Our Flat”
takes the floor.
“ The County Fair” has been buzzing
along merrily at Her Majesty’s, and the homely
but quaint picture it gives of life on a New Eng-
land (U.S.A.) farm, draws laughing approval
nightly. Frank J. Currier’s Otis Tucker, the
Yankee farmer who bashfully spoons the mistress
of his husky heart for 14 years, is an individual-
istic creation worthy of a granite monument. His
facial obtuseness is indefinably transmitted, and
he never shakes off one fold of the personality
with which, he has clothed himself. Sadie String-
ham, the middle-aged maid of Otis Tucker’s heart,
fairly effervesces with the contradictory spurts of
a quick-tempered but kind-hearted Yankee farm-
mistress, and her nightgown evolutions in search
of the cause of a noise which she “saw ’’ comprise
some masterly gymnastics. Roland Watts-Phillips
speaks and acta- more like a city girl of refined-
education than one brought up on a farm. The
race-illusion, in which four horses are apparently
galloping their hardest and “never getting no
for’arder,” elicits nightly applause, which is con-
tinued’till Cold Molasses is declared the winning
horse and the liquid'atoi; of Miss Abby’s mortgage.
Jimmy MaeMahon has evidently “ headed ’em ”

occured, to mar the success of the run. Mr.
Kershaw continues to, beam ’vyith unfailing regu-
larity, whether the skittish Jane bangs him on the,
head with a spoon, or fondles him on the sofa, a,hd
the rag-baby is still the boneless object of conten-
tion. “ Jane” fades from, the view of an admiring
public on Friday next, and “ Evangeline ” (fresh
from triumphs at Sandhurst and Ballarat, and
the object of Jimmy MacMahon’s virgin affections)
will pop, into her vapant dressing-room on the
following evening. The Sydney public are-
impationt to be dazzled.

the napie of “Grapes.” Gettysburg was-only
fought 28 years ago, and the matter is proved
beyond doubt by the animal’s resemblance, to a

“ The Profligate,” which London critics
tried to establish amongst the immortals of,
dramatic literature, was produced at Melbourne
Bijou last week. Ibsen’s influence makes itself
severely felt in this overrated arrangement of false
creations. Pinero had probably, been, sitting up
for forty-eight hours, with the works of the
Scandinavian sage, before he lay down and
dreamed, , this elegant fable in four acts. It is
certainly not the effort of a wide-awake optimist,
but of a drowsy cynic, trying for the moment to
imagine things that never were nor will be, and
amusing himself by writing counter to the lessons
of human nature. Pinero lacks the Ibsenic faith
in absurdities, however. Although “The Profli-
gate ” is interesting in its action, and contains
many smart and beautiful lines, it has not the
genuine ring of the other gentleman’s plays.
Briefly, the story is that of a . cold, methodical
Hbertule mfcde fanatically good by marriage Willi
an abnormally innocent girl. A weak and
foolish combination of circumstances caused the
loving wife to pick up one of his former victims and
discover that the idol of her heait was a “betrayer ’
before he reformed. Then she rocks to and fro,
like a boat on troubled waters, and says “deny
it! ” with the persistency of a minute-gun. The
profligate is too repentant to deny it, she says
“go!”—and begets. There arc two endings to
the play, and both have been tried at the Bijou.
One night the profligate took poison; next night
ho jibbed at the prussic acid just previous to his
Wife finding him on his knees and forgiving him.
The former termination, being the most prepos-
terous, is the more consistent with the rest of the
story, but the vox populi. has declared in favour of
the latter. A yoUng lawyer friend and adorer of
the innocent heroine behaves like a lunatic when-
ever he gets an opportunity, and “ the girl who’s
been betrayed” is a hopeless case. She Wanders into
the lawyer's office, asking him to find her seducer,
whose real name she doesn’t know, but whose face
she sketches on the blotting pad. Charles Cart-
wright’s face is not an easy one to delineate with
ten strokes of a pencil, yet the agitated attorney,
trembling as he glances over the girl’s shoulder,
recognises the likeness and says—“ O, my God 1 ”
What does he next? Does he say—“ Young lady,
a brilliant future awaits you on The Bulletin ;
take an engagement at £2O a week and sin no
more?” No. He lets her walk out of the office
and become a sort of superior domestic to an
offensive, but cute and high-toned stout female,
in whose service she faints by the road-side.
So it comes about that the heroine takes com-
passion on this “ ruined ” spinster, and when
her story becomes known the heroine’s brother
developes a consuming passion for his profligate
relative’s cast-off mash. Perhaps he marries hex-
after the curtain falls, in which case they must
all form an interesting family-circle between
them. As “The Profligate” is now withdrawn,
the clever performance of the principals can be
hastily dismissed. Miss Nether-sole's innocence
is associated with her usual pretty affectations of
manner; Cartwright plays his unreal character
with hard force, and Titheradge does his best for
the lawyer. Miss Emma Temple is a pleasing
failux-e as the betrayed damsel, and Boucicault,
with Miss Watt-Tanner, throw natural side-lights
on the second act. Four nights of “Moths” are
to close on Friday. On Saturday they play “ The
Idler ” for a wind-up of the season.

A great financial success for “ Cleopatra ”
was assured before the olive-skinned queen
stepped out of her barge at Melbourne Princess’,
yet the management may have made a mistake in
producing Sardou’s tragedy so soon. Hundreds
of people were waiting to see Bernhardt m what
they imagined to be her finest character, and a
largo proportion of those hundreds are now at a
loss to understand the furore she created at the
outset. Worse still, they go around town mocking
at the boom; and sighing for the shillings they
paid to see a spectacle that certainly didn’t dazzle
the general eye (though its artistic merits are
many) and a “star ” who gave them but a faint
notion of her brilliancy. Expecting to be stag-
gered they paid the extra prices for a show in
which the all-round efficiency of the company,
bax-ring only the dandy Marc Antony, was almost
as noticeable as Sara’s individual perform-
ance, but the muddle-headed multitute pay little
heed to small parts spoken in a foreign tongue.
They kept one eye on Sara and the other on the
scenery, and—as already stated —neither optic
was dazzled. Should business wane during the
current week the misfortune can be fairly attri-
buted to “ Cleopatra,” or rather to the vain hopes
excited by irresponsible rumours. With three
fresh plays on the programme and “Camille”
again for Saturday night, intelligent interest in
Sara will remain at fever heat anyway.
Promises as yet unfulfilled are “Adrienne
Lecouvreur” to-night (18th), “Frou-Frou” to-
morrow (19th), and “ Joan of Arc”’for the Satur-
day matinee. It is after being burnt soft in the
market-place of Rouen that Bernhardt rises from
her ashes to die with her wonderful backthrow
as La Dame aux Camelias. On Monday they
produce “Theodora” on a scale of magnificence
which can be confidently looked forward to, inas-
much as Brunton and Goateher have painted the
scenery on- the premises. Theodora is a great
character—gruesome, but tremendous. So another
rush for seats will bring a memorable season to a
qlose, and the actress, who is divine even in the
teeth of Evangelist Varley seems certain to go out
as large a lioness as she came in. By the way,
“ Cleopatra,” has apparently cured Sara of hex-
disposition to irritate the public between acts.
Her proud spirit rose against the thought of ladies
fussing out whilst she, Sarah, was on the stage,,
and she allowed the performance to terminate by
H.IQ after that noisy Monday mentioned in our
last..

by Bland Holt’s evenly-balanced company at
Adelaide Royal, has so far been financially suc-
cessful. The cast is the same as in Sydney, and
Albert Norman (whom we are glad to' see about
again) is, as usual, a.booster of the cause of crime.
“ The Bells of Haslemere ” will follow. Wybert
Reeve has arranged for the “divine Sara” for
six nights, and with increased prices this should
prove at least anon-losing engagement for the new
manager of the Adelaide Royal. Rev. Charles
Clark is at the Town Hall, and Tommy Hudson
has just commenced a probably successful season,
at Garner’s Rooms.
At Poverty Point.
We knew it’ was coming, Melbourne photographers
begin to display society ladies emulating Sylvia Grey and
Letty Lind in the skirt dances. These poor little girls of
Toorak should be soundly smacked ere they go to rack
and ruin.
“ Loge ” writes: I.put in a.nice, dreamy Saturday after-
noon with Sara’s “ Dame aux Camellias.” Stalls not full,
just comfortable. Everything is subdued, even the
entr’acte music, and it is drawing-room acting all round.
Well,, you know, you can see that Sally Heartburn is
over 19—what's the use of talking? Her arms have a
dead look.
A correspondent: Dick Thatcher’s disappearance sets
me thinking of his brother Charley. How strange it was
that the star comique and composer of Heffeman’s Sham-
rock, Bendigo, should die in a search after fancy shells,

in the East Indian Archipelago ! His widow was Lydia
Howards, the vocalist and operatic artiste.
Varley is “ out ” with the Southern Cross (religious
paper). It printed some of his letter on Sara, but
chopped out the “best” half, the most abusive, so that
Varley now pubjishes the whole on his own account, and
challenges Maurice Bernhardt, or anyone else, to come
along. Alas ! Varley kicks against the pricks. Cleopatra
will in this wicked world always command more attention
and admiration than any puffy, fat man who advocates
doctrines altogether at variance with his personal
appearance.
According to Mme. Ristori’s statement the receipts of
her Australian tour panned out: Sydney, 21 nights,
£4102 ; Melbourne, 30 nights, £4795 ; Sydney (return), 12
nights, £1441; Melbourne (return), 3 nights, £1003;
Sandhurst, 2 nights, £442; Ballarat, 5 nights, £465 ;
Geelong, 1 night, £159 ; Adelaide, 11 nights, £1246.
“ Hedda Gabler ” seems to have burst-up the dead-set
against Ibsen prevailing among English critics.
Melbournian writes: I made Richmond Thatcher’s
acquaintance when at his zenith, as Mrs. Scott-Siddons’
agent, and first saw him radiant in full evening-dress
going from Garton’s to the Athemeum, where his star was
giving readings. It was an education for a young Mel-
bourne man to be introduced to the innocent Sydney
Bohemians, ranging through all the variety of the
Thatchers, Harold Stephen, Kendall, Walch, Dick Lee,
Bunster, Montague Scott, Wangenheim— et hoe and bitter
Bass.
Mrs. Rignold is in Melbourne for the Bernhardt season,
and Spagnoletti says he saw her sailing down the Block
with a string of French actresses like a young ladies’
seminary—guide, philosopher, and friend.
Pinero’s “Profligate,” Melbourne Bijou, again raises
the question of publishers and managers interfering with
the denouement of novels and plays. Cartwright acts the
piece with the unhappy ending, as Pinero wrote, and not
the happy one insisted on by Manager Hare. Beerbohm
Tree spoilt the “Dancing Girl” the same way, and the
London Adelphi audience made Boucicault spoil “The
Octoroon,” which powerfully ended with her death origi-
nally.
It was a great treat to hear Pinero read his “Profligate,’’
in London, a few' months ago. He is a beautiful reader,
though a very indifferent actor, which is often the case.
The two things hardly ever go together, and Irving has
killed elocution on the stage.
A quarter of a century ago Irving was rather noted in
Bill Sikes, acting it to Toole’s “Artful Dodger,” and
Frank Thornton told the writer this was the first thing
that drew his attention to Irving.
What occasioned the recent interminable act-waits at the
Melbourne Princess’ ? Sara’s make-up is very simple,
after the first plastering. Anyone would think each dress
was fixed on with a thousand pins.
Memory of Irving’s first night in “ The Bells” We
strolled into the Lyceum, not expecting much, save from
the afterpiece of “Pickwick,” in which Irving was so
funny as Jingle. Gradually this Mathias seized upon the
house—fascinated, calvanised, like Kean’s first night in
Shylock. In the third act the performer’s fortune was
made. Memorable was it to see him stagger out, in his
shirt-sleeves, and receive the thunderous congratulations.
And how' miraculous was the transition to his Jingle ! In
a few nights he yielded it to Chas. Warner.”
Alice Sydney Burvett has been trickling over the piano
at Melbourne Town Hall. A blonde young lady of distin-
guished appearance, familiar on the Collins-street Block
With henna and her little poodle, which she leads by a
silvery chain. Miss Burvett advertises, indignantly, her
contempt for the Melbourne critics, and indeed the ring
against her is inexplicable. Alice, an Australian, has had ■
hard fights, and somehow the Melbourne writers have sat
on her spare frame, and tried to crush her out in the past,
but she won’t be squelched and is resolved to score. She
duetted the “ Marche Hongroise ” with Kowalski himself
at Paris Chatelet Theatre.
The old, old story, from the Inverbll(N.S.W.) Times :
“The Co, left Inverell without settling their
little bill with its. They possess neither honesty, ability,
nor money.”
Yet another theatre proposed in Melbourne—a revival
of the old project to buildatcornerofLonsdaleand Exhibi-
tion streets. Promoters “ will endeavour to be in sym-
pathy with the Church ” :
The dews of death are on its brow,
The Church will damn it, “hence” and now.
Thus does London Telegraph tramp on Ibsen. There
is a vigour about it which is not common in the
Telegraph: “Outside a silly clique there is not the
slightest interest in the Scandinavian humbug. . . The
decent householder puts his garbage and offal outside the
door. But some w'ell-bred and educated dog is sure to
foot OVet the pile, and to bury his nose in the nastiest
morsel. The better bred and educated the dog the more
he relishes the worst scrap of carrion. Cannot we leave
this muck-heap to the educated and much-ferreting dogs?
But what would have been the good to hunt away these
educated individuals from the Ibsen dust-bin ? They
know it is nasty, and they pretend to conceal their love of
nastiness with a love of literature.” The Telegraph isn’t
much good at illustration, anyhow. The assertion that a
“decent householder ” habitually stacks offal in front of
his door to be rushed by lost dogs seem to suggest that
the paper grew up in Petticoat-lane.
Why can’t Bernhardt’s plays be cut down ? Look at
“CRopatre,” set to play nigh four hours! “Cut the
dialeck and get to the ’osses,”as Ducrow said. “Fedora”
is a splendid model of the scud under bare poles.
Baccarat is the card game played in “Camille” at
Melbourne Princess’.
Grand operas which have never been heard in Australia:
Wagner s “ Tannhauser,” “ Tristan und Isolde,” “ Walkyre,”
“Siegfried,” “Parsifal,” “ Rienzi,” “ Meistersinger ; ”
Verdi’s “Don Carlos,” “ Otello ; ’ Sullivan's “Ivanhoe;”
Gounod’s “Romeo and Juliet;’ Gluck’s “Orfeo ’ —very
successful in London this season.
Bernhardt’s scenery is rather faded, but she relishes her
familiar setting, and so the mounting of “LaTosca”is
quite shabby beside that in the Potter season. When she
gets in front of Goatcher and Hennings, for “ Theodora,”
she will be ready to abandon her old stuff.
Williamson and Garner are munching over Sullivan's
“Ivanhoe,’'more about which will be heard, when Bern-
hardt, Nelly Farren and Fred. Leslie are moved on. Next
years big thing will be “Ivanhoe," with, maybe, the
“Cigale” for this Christmas. “Ivanhoe” will require a
double cast—but, indeed, there must be two or three
fresh voices got to sing it at all, and a prima donna is
indispensable.
Visiting theatricals don’t half like the Melbourne
Princess’ stage-door, on the front street, Spring. This
was a device to abolish masherdom, but seems to reduce
theatricals too much to common dust, with the gloze and
glamour gone.
Commentary on the current ignorance of Shakespeare.
Lamonby, having lent to a friend his volume of Shake-
speare containing “Taming of the Shrew,” trusts to a
Yankee quotation of some length from that play, and
sends it to the Argus as an illustration of Shakespeare
prigging from Marlowe, but the quotation doesn’t appear
at all in the play—nevertheless the Argus inserts it!
Whereupon James Smith, of course, comes down like a
thousand of bricks.
Our esteemed friend, H, H. Vincent, late manager for
Williamson and Garner, writes from London that he is
cosily settled there, on his return. He quickly dropped
into an engagement with Wyndham at the Criterion,
where he made a success right off with his Max
Harkaway, in the “London Assurance” revival. At the
latest, Vincent was acting Sir Oliver Surface in “The
School for Scandal.”
The Victorian Art Society holds a reception in honour
of Sara B,
Erneat Hutcheson, the Australian pianist, opens his
Sydney season at Y.M.C.A. Hall on Thursday, 18th June.
The Hallos open at Sydney Town Hall, on Thursday,
25th June.
Mr. J. E. Sykes gave an organ recital at Sydney
University on the 13th. He plays shortly on the Town
Hall leviathan.
A London writer wants to know why unsuccessful plays
are so wildly and lengthily advertised with cooked press
notices and column “ ads.,” while successful plays are
advertised in an inch of space all round. He asserts that
this is the reason why, when a success has exhausted a
theatre’s clientele, business drops so suddenly.
( Miss Pedley, niece of the late Mons. Sainton, played the
“Ganz” violin willed to her by the great musician (won
at the Conservatoire, 1834) at a Sydney Y.M.C.A. concert
the other evening.
“Jack ” Beer Johnstone, the oldest actor on the British
stage, author of over 150 dramas and pantomimes, and
the father of Eliza Johnstone, died at London recently,
aged 89.
( Jennie Lee has arrived in Sydney from New Zealand.
She intends to produce “Hun Wild,” probably at the
Garrick.
Lightning-calculator Moulton was pulled off his platform
at Balmain the other evening by some roughs. One leg
was broken in two places.
The operetta “Prince and Pedlar” was played by the
pupils of Fort-street Public School to a tremendous
audience at Sydney Her Majesty’s on Saturday last. The
pupils, trained by Mr. Turner, the head-master, played
and sang with the easy coolness of old hands, much to the
satisfaction of their relatives and friends.
The English census reveals the fact that Genevieve
Ward’s mother is still alive. She must indeed be very old.
Nothing more has been heard of the reported split at
London Lyceum. Like Royal Palaces, that home of
Thespis is perhaps not allowed to shelter a scandal, and
people are sworn to secrecy.
Thanks to Marion Lea and Elizabeth Robins, both
charming actresses, Ibsen’s “ Hedda Qabler”—pronounced
“ Gaybler ” —has had so large a measure of success at the
Vaudeville Matinees, that Tom Thorne is going to put the
play in the evening bill, “Money,” the time-worn, having
failed to attract. It is doubtful if “Hedda Gabler”will
draw an evening crowd, for truth to tell, the bulk of the
enthusiasts are professional “ dead-heads”—writes a
Bulletin contributor from London.
Ireland seems to rival America in the production of
good singers, we have Leslie Grotty, Barton McGuckin,
Esmond, O'Mara and others, and now D’Oyley Carte, says
our London correspondent, has unearthed another bari-
tone in the person of Mr. Arthur Seaton, who bids fair to
make a name for himself. He studied at the Regio
Conservatoire at Milan, where his teacher formed a very
high opinion of his voice and dramatic aptitude. Apropos,
a great number of young Irishmen, sons of men who
have “come down in the world,” have adopted the
profession of entertainers with considerable success.
Haddon Chambers is scooping the dollars. “ The Idler”
plays in London to about £2OO nightly, and his arrange-
ment is a very liberal one.
Yarley scarifies Bernhardt. An absurd mass of misap-
prehepsion, which five minutes’ chat with her would
dissipate.
Sara Bernhardt’s acting is a marvel in its restraint and
chastity. One sees plainly how English actresses merely
make most pieces an excuse to spread themselves out in
sensuous excess. There is not the faintest coarseness
in Bernhardt’s renditions, as in those of a Potter or a
Langtry.
Madame Simonsen wires from Milan that she has
obtained a first-class opera-troupe for Australia. If only
as good as the crowd which included Mesdames Ciuti,
Rebottaro, Tagliavia, MM. Lazzarini, Santinelli, D’Alba,
&c., it will pay, but really we want an Abbey to play the
Augustus Harris, or even the Lyster, to furnish Mel-
bourne and Sydney with a properly established grand
opera. All behind the times.
Albert Richardson, baritone, is back in Melbourne,
after many years. When grand opera was in vogue he
made a rise by bringing out his pupils in most ambitious
operatic programmes, as Grisis, Marios, and Lablaches in
embryo. Among them were Miss Nordt, Messrs. C.
Moule, Hannah, &o.
In the Life Guards’ (amateur) burlesque society has
came nearer to the footlights than ever, to the extent
even of recognising tights.
Strand Magazine prints a photo, of Mr. Langtry and hia
Lily, taken shortly after their marriage. He was then a
tallowy-looking young man, in moustache and pot-hat.
“ Cleopatra ” is a distinctly inferior play, not a scrap of
poetry—nothing but carpentry in authorship—and yet it
is hideously drawn out in political speeches. How is it
men will only be enchanted with the bad-’uns—“ Helen
of Troy” (The World’s Desire), “Cleopatra,’ and “Mary
Stuart ? ” Here are the three most historical women.
When Sara acted “Theodora” in Paris, it was said the
public indeed had a surfeit of them, for Masse’s “Cleo-
Eatia” was given at the Opera House, and the spectacular
allet of “Messalina” at the Eden. Faustine is the
newest Parisian play, exalting such creatures, in a Roman
Empress. “Catherine of Russia” was as bad as “Cleo-
patra ’’—but no scandal about Queen Elizabeth.
The Duke of Edinburgh recently played at a concert at
Bristol in aid of the District Nurses’ Society. Nurses are
people to whom the members of the Royal Family owe a
great deal. Alfred led the orchestra and played the
obligato to Braga’s Serenade ; but as R. S. Smytbe, who
was at the concert, did not offer him an engagement, the
distinguished amateur probably did not quite come up to
Camilla Urso. The Much Travelled went to Bristol to
hear Amy Sherwin sing Marguerite in “ Faust ” with
the Carl Rosa Co.
“ Money,” which was put up at London Vaudeville, has
played to little but paper. Probably it is never been
played worse, even by amateurs.
Wilson Barrett has had to succumb to adverse fortune,
and has shut up the New Olympic. - - 1
We are so much accustomed to hear the praises of old-
time actors sung to the disparagement of modern players
that the following epigrammatic sketch of by-gone
worthies will be read with amusement“ Charles
Kemble was a silver-toned, sententious mannerist;
Edmund Kean was a stuttering, spasmodic mannerist ;
Macready and Phelps always grim and growling over their
bones; Charles Kean had a chronic cold in the head ;
Keeley was sleek and sleepy; Buckstone, a chuckler ;
Compton, funny as a funeral; Ben Webster, always im-
perfect, with a Somersetshire dialect; Charles Mathews,
a Mephisto in kid gloves and patent-leather boots ; and
Ryder, a roarer.”
Ada F itzroy, Melbourne Waxworks, is amazingly clever.
Her feats of memory are unique, and she does the Daven-
port Bros, feats to perfection.
Somebody wants particulars about Henry Neil Warner.
He must be nigh seventy now, teaching elocution, in the
States. When the Melbourne Royal opened, 1855, he was
a powerful opponent to G. V. Brooke, in parts like the
Corsican Brothers, but he became too much a Brooke
imitator.
Luckless Joubert had the Melbourne Alexandra designed
on the model of the finest Vienna theatre. Hence the
public favour, because everyone can see, whereas the
English idea seems to be that the cheap people mustn’t if
it can be helped. Observe the form of the theatre, like a
T, with the auditory broadside on to the stage, instead of
lengthwise, as usual.
Two Melbourne morning critics find Duquesne’s Scarpia
much inferior to Bellew’s, the third emphatically declares
the reverse, but fat Duquesne, an oily Tartuffe, is all
behind the point, sarcasm, and passion of Bellew in the
part. Duquesne is rather a stuffy substitute for Gamier,
Sara’s Parisian leading man.
Terry is running “ The Rocket ” at his London theatre,
and he sends up a rocket from the roof as the curtain
rises every evening.
Nellie Payne, one of the talented Payne family of bell-
ringers, &0., died of chronic phthisis at Moonta(S.A.) last
week. She caught cold about twelve months ago.
George Rignold was in Melbourne last week, negotiating
for the production of Doctor Carver, his Indians, and the
tank in Sydney.
An impudent varlet—a London bookseller—advertises
for sale over 1000 MS. plays, never acted and never
printed, to such individuals as may desire to gain
notoriety as authors without the labour or the brain to
produce any literary work.
An actress at present playing in Sydney proudly
asserted the other day that she was "the connoisseur of
all eyes.”
Madame Melba has lunched with the Prince and. Princes 8
of Wales. She is not so exclusive as she used to be.
At Melbourne Princess’ a stage-oarpenter, suddenly
bursting open one of the swing-doors, nearly knocked
down a Frenchman of the Bernhardt Company—who at
once took off his hat, bowed profoundly, and said :
“ Pardon, monsieur.” “ Oh, it’s all right,” said the car
penter.
The ballet-master of the Viennese ballet “Rouge at
Noir,” having weeded his troupe of the older dancers
calmly replied to complaints: “ Ladies, this ballet is
‘ Rouge et Noir,’ not ‘ Trente et Quarante.”’
The latest development in the show business is keeping
awake for money. In Detroit, lately, at the Wonderland
Museum, six men started to abstain from sleep (a closed
eye indicates slumber) during seven days and nights for
£lOO purse. When the mail left the contest had lasted
five days and only two wide-awakes were left in, one of
these had gone slightly silly, but had been cute enough to
enter into a keep-one-another-from-sleeping union with his
antagonist.
Stanley’s Zanzibar boy, Sali, didn’t get on well in
America. He went into an Atlanta hotel and sat down,
and a man came and shook him. Says he: “1 said
‘What’s the matter?’ He said, ‘Get out, you ——
nigger.’ In England the Queen shook my hand and I went
to the Prince of Wales’ house. In this diotel they say,
‘ Get out, you nigger ! ’ ”
The law which excludes leg-shows, ballet and skirt*
dances, female circus-riders, &0., from Minnesota, also, of
necessity, prohibits “ As You Like It,” “Twelfth Night,”
and all the plays and operas wherein the heroine dons
man’s attire, or wherein the music of a man part is scored
for a woman’s voice.
Woe betide a woman whom stage fascination prompts
to barter away honour and home! Thirteen years
ago the world was shocked when the Earl of Desart
obtained a divorce against his wife because of her rela-
tions with Charles Sugden, the actor. Last mail brings
news of the ex-Countess’s second divorce. Her actor-
husband, for whom she lost all, deserted her and cohabited
with a servant.
“Poor Jonathan” makes little headway at
Melbourne Opera House, although that apotheosised
cook is full of tune and not altogether destitute of points.
But being something of an outrage on comic opera
tradition in the matter of costumes and business,
“Jonathan” must surely die. A censorious world con-
demns him without a trial, and the onlookers, metaphori-
cally speaking, turn their thumbs down at the Yankee
stranger when Vandergold threatens to destroy him in
the second act. And this notwithstanding that the
latter’s struggle to remember the fatal melody is a
very humorous conception. Snazelle, the ladies, and, in
a lesser degree, Leumane, have worked up their parts;
also the orchestra, under Hamilton Clarke, is a strong
feature in a dispiriting night’s work. Yet these things
are of small practical account in a half-filled house. One
feels sorry for “ Poor Jonathan,” as for a harmless in-
dividual gone wrong, or a tale that might have been
better told. “The Gipsy Belle” is in rehearsal and will
probably be wanted before another week runs out.

At the Alexandra they will take the muzzle off
“ The Trapper ” on Saturday night, when a grand all-
round slaughter of wild tribes, villains, and things is cer-
tain to ensue. “The Scout,” now at its last splash, is a
calm domestic drama as compared with “The Trapper,”
in which the historical tank swallows up creation at one
fell gulp, and the entertainment has to start anew with a
fresh catalogue of horrors. Frank Carver, his Injins and
other appurtenances, naturally improve as they grow
accustomed to the stage. Lily Dampier, too, can send a
bullet through the eye of a needle, and all the materials for
a regular booster are in readiness. Nellie Farren and
Fred. Leslie shuddered at the tank effects, the other
night, whilst yesterday’s (Wednesday) matinee gave Sara
Bernhardt an opportunity to understand that realism is
still in its infancy at the Porte St. Martin.

“ Betsy ” is due to re-appear at the Bijou next

The Halles, having engaged the Victorian
Orchestra and laid themselves out to attract the mass of
music-lovers, had the Town Hall nicely packed on Satur-
day. Charles Hall 6 is, above all things, a great con-
ductor, and when he waves a baton around his. wife’s
violin solos in a bit of Beethoven’s best—well, the audi-
ence get as near to Heaven as most of them can expect to
reach. It is worth noticing that the management offers a
concession in price to Vic. Orchestra subscribers, who,
being the avowed supporters of classical melody, are able
to buy reserved stalls for two “ bob ” less than the quoted
price. This is a practical arrangement, with a moral
hanging thereto,
ft ft ft
Jude’s Musical Evenings at the Athenaeum turn
out to be chiefly remarkable for his skilful treatment of
the harmonium. Jude can do everything in reason, and
much that seems impossible, with this widely-neglected
instrument. Sounds of the rolling drum, bagpipes, and
silvery lute are conjured up from its cranky interior, and
when the performer finishes a fantasia there isn’t a mad
rush for the doors in anticipation of the offertory basin.
As a rule the harmonium is so dreadfully suggestive of a
collection. Jude has the hall for five more nights this
week, whilst the Bellringers chip in on Saturdays, as
already mentioned.

Elsewhere the ball keeps rolling. The Victoria
Hall has taken to calling itself the “Berth of Mirth.”
Frank Clark and Slade Murray seem to be fetching them
into the Gaiety, and Miss Ada Fitzroy is a first-class
favourite at the Waxworks. She gives a pretty little
show in an especially pretty little way.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Albert Victor, the second Coming K., rode in a
military steeplechase recently, and finished seventh. Lots
of the other fellahs came fearful croppers, by the way,
some of them being grassed through their nervous
anxiety to leave a clear course for “ Collars and Cuffs,”
who is said to have sat out the affair, on a splendid
jumper, without betraying a gleam of interest.

If a colt and a filly were to make a dead-heat
for the A.J.C. or V.R.C. Derby, and didn’t run it off, they
would both have to carry 7st. 61b. in the Melbourne Cup,
provided they were entered and handicapped below that
weight. Consequently the filly would then have exactly
51bs. the worst of it with the colt, on their Derby running.
Year after year Tub Bulletin has called attention to this
tiny weak spot in the Melbourne Cup conditions. Sooner
or later the dead-heat we have suggested will come to
pass, and then the aggrieved owner will get on the spot,
and everybody will see, when the fact is right under their
noses, what this long-sighted journal perceives in the dim
distance. Five pounds too much in the saddle is a serious
matter when there is £lO,OOO at stake.

Should Ramage’s leg (what a bad pair he had to
be sure) not be well by the Spring meeting, who will steer
Carbine in his engagements? Hales is spoken of, but,
good horseman as he is, the public don’t like him in a big
field now'. In Derbys and Legers with a field of about
eight, Tommy is a perfect general—but in a big blocking-
race the cool, level-headed Ramage is the man.

The real “sports ”at the Choynski-Dooley farce

The beneficiary was unable to be present at the
De Mestre complimentary race-meeting over Randwick
on Monday last. Owing to election excitement the
attendance was not large, about 4000 being present. Not
one favourite got home first, and several of the winners
were practically unbacked. J. R. Richardson’s Repeater(7st
51b) w'Ou “ The Tim Whiffler ” Handicap by a head from
Kelso's Denman. Lamond s gelding Johnnie won the
Navigator Handicap, a race for 2-year-olds, with 6st 111 b
on his back, by a neck from Fielder’s colt, Welcome. The
Selling Race was won by Payten s Reversion, the nearest
approach to a favourite among the winners of the day.
The Bookmakers’ Purse was pocketed by T. Ivory, by aid
of Sweetbit, a 5-year-old, with 6st 111 b, followed home at
a neck s interval by Dowling’s Helene, 3yre, 6st 111 b, and
Hop Bitters, 6yrs, 7st 71b. Herbert's Bex, syrs, Bst 71b,

It is pathetic to notice how the Melbourne
sporting papers invariably describe a little lightweight
jockey as Master Whitty, because his father happens to
be a rather amateur kind of trainer. The English rags
are not so bad as this. Some of the “Home” trainers
have two or three liveried flunkeys to wait at table, but
if their youngsters get into the saddle for a race they are
listed under their surnames, pure and simple.

W. O. Hodgkinson advises the Toowoomba
Presbytery to attend race-meetings, as St. Paul did at
Tarsus, and thus personally superintend a crusade against
gambling:—
It doesn’t help the “boxing” interest to see
such things as this in the paper (Argus):— “ Choynski
drove Dooley on to the ropes, and then forced him round
to his own corner, where he used his right with telling
effect, and Dooley went down from a blow on the jaw. He
declined to take his full time, and came to his feet after
six seconds, when Choynski hit him on the neck, and he
fell again. He appeared quite dazed, but struggled to his
feet after four seconds, and Choynski, who had been hold-
ing his right far back, never gave him a chance, but
dashed it in with tremendous force on the point of the
jaw. Dooley fell in a sitting posture for a second or two,
and then dropped flat on his back, his head striking the
boards with a loud crash. He was unable to move, and
remained insensible after the blow for four minutes.”
Again (in another paper):—“For a considerable time
after being removed to his dressing-room Dooley was in a
dazed state. He was assisted to dress, but every now and
then would sit down and bury his head in his hands and
remain so for some minutes. It was half an hour after
the fight before he could speak sensibly.” This all reads
like murder in the first degree.

rag he penned' the notices of such plays as were scorned
by the regular critic, wrote racing-tips in prose and
verse, reported prize-fights, boat, foot and swimming
races, did general newspaper-touting, hashed up leaders
on emergencies, and occasionally assisted the proof-
reader. When the Glowworm died be had a rough time

The following genuine letter, published by an
English contemporary, speaks for itself;—
“ Wheatfields, April 19,1891.
“My Lord,—ln reply to your Lordship’s letter, the St.
Bernard, Thisby (Thisbe, of course, Ed.), pupped a
Thursday morning, three pups. All are well. My Lord,
my respectful compliments to her Ladyship, and to the

When Gov. Kintore was at Port Darwin, the
secretary of the Katherine River Turf Club epistled him
for a subscription. Kintore never answered the note.
Before the vice-regal party left, Dr. Stirling donated 30s.
to the club, which thereupon added to its “kreckt kard’‘
the following:—
Notice Extraordinary.
Katherine Donkey Race, value 80s., donated jointly by
Lord Kintore and Dr. Stirling. Last horse, £1; first
horse, 10s. Distance, 1 mile ; catch weights. Com-
peting horses must not be valued over £5 by the
stewards. To be run the last day of the meeting, 25th
May, 1891. Post entry, 10s.
Could insult go further?
India, which already owed £206,000,000,
has just offered in London a 3 per cent, loan of
£2,600,000 at 92, and got it subscribed twice over
at £94 10s. One day England will lose India, also
the principal and interest of India’s loans. Mean-
while, however, India is ever so much more

•I. b. Patterson, who was recently wind-

Those who superficially rely on co-opera-
tion, or profit-sharing, as solutions of the Problem
or i overly, may be asked to give a single instance
where the system has hitherto proved successful,
f? 8 progressive stage towards State Socialism,
, e 18 valuable, but it must always bo recol-
ected that it matters little whether competition
be between individuals or companies, the funda-
mental principle is hopelessly rotten.
THE REASON WAS OBVIOUS.
WARM ADMIRER: “ Why are you so cold?”
There are signs without number that an
insidious and powerful effort is being made to
introduce the principle of land-grant railways into
democratic South Australia. There is not much
hope that the Playford Government will veto this
pernicious system, as they have already fixed up
a preliminary agreement with an expectant
syndicate. It is also not unlikely that Parliament
will approve of the transcontinental trunk-line
being completed on the land-grant principle.
Parkes was the real author of the proposal
to substitute “Prime Minister” for “Premier,”
and has spoken of himself on every possible occa-
sion as “Prime Minister of the great colony of
New South Wales,” making a large mouthful of
the pompous phrase. Parkes now repudiates
“Prime Minister.” Why ? Simply because (a
typical specimen of his miserable vanity) the
Premier of South Australia officially adopted the
thing first.
Premier Griffith has got the Queensland
Cabinet to consent to ask the Parliament of the
Northern colony to vote Queensland’s share of the
Australian naval tribute fund, hitherto, refused,
But the Parliament is likely not to “see it.”
Treasurer MTiwraith has acquiesced, and so
turned a complete political somersault on the
“ national ” policy with which he carried the con-
stituencies in ’BB, probably because the loan fiasco
has put him in a blue funk.
N. Z. Government is letting railway-con-
tracts to unemployed workers on the co operative
principle, at fixed rates. The first.of these con-
tracts left the men a balance of £l2OO for a-years
work, after paying 10s. a day to each man and 1-s.
a day to each foreman, although 27 more men were
employed than previous contractors had engaged
for similar work. Another illustration of how the
middlemen—absent in this instance —gobble up
the profits of labor. The new system may be pro-
fitably transplanted to Australia.
Queensland Government has had to crawl
before the London financial magnates and has
accepted % millions of 3i per cents (formerly
offered at 94) on terms amounting to something
less than 90 ! The Treasurer has got to pay up,
by June 30, £1,170,950, borrowed on debentures in
1886 by Griffith at 0 per cent. Two and a half
millions at 90 only means 2\ millions cash ; so'
that the present fatal loan will give MTiwraith
something just over a million down—all of which
is probably hypothecated in advance.
A striking comment by Want, Q.C.
“ Now for the last 20 years, we have never seen
the Queen’s birthday pass without Imperial
honours being conferred on prominent politicians.
But on the last Queen’s Birthday, this ancient and
unbroken precedent was strangely ruptured,—
because it was known perfectly well that if these
distinctions were showered on the delegates [to the
Federal Convention], the people would have risen
with one voice and said that at the back of this
Federation business was the Imperial Govern-
ment.”
Oid Parkes may “ stack ” his spieling plant,
And yell, in times between :
“ Hi’ll bet yer two to one yer can't
I’ick out tlie Lady Queen.”
No use. We watched the cards go down ;
We’re not so very green ;
lu “Federation ’neath the Crown,”
We twig “the Lady Queen.”
“ Free-tection Federal* ” may rave,
We know just what they mean ;
For every politician knave
Would “ fake the Lady Queen.”
New South Wales is a glorious freetrade
country, and Parkes is her prophet. Salt, every
man’s necessity, is taxed 20s. a ton ; silks, the
fineries of the wealthy few, are free of duty. Tea,
the common people’s beverage, is taxed 3d. per
lb.; gold and silver plate, the splendours of the
pot-bellied monopolist, is free. Sugar is taxed,
according to variety, from £5 to £6 13s. 4d. pet
ton; carpets, for the gouty feet of privilege, are
free. Kerosene oil, the light of the poor, bears a
tax of Gd. a gallon; pianos and carriages, the
luxuries of the brow-beating classes, are free.
Bacon and cheese pay 2d. a lb. ; jewellery comes
in free. And so on for ever so many items.
Landed estates are untaxed, and the tariff of
N.S.W. freetraders is “ free ” only for the classes;
hot many chances are missed of so selecting the
items to be taxed that the workers pay 90 per-
cent. of the collections. Good old Free-tection 1
So the N.S.W, .Premier has been sending
a “touching message ” to the Canadian Dominion
Government in re the death of “ Old To morrow ”
Macdonald. We are not privileged up to date-to
inspect the message aforesaid, which was probably
a sickening specimen of Imperialistic slush and
utterly unfit for publication in N.S. Wales on the
eve of a general election ; but we have before us
the reply, which expresses gratitude for the
N.S.W. “touching etc.” One thing is certain:
an expensive cablegram quite unnecessarily
“touches ” the N.S.W. taxpayers. “ Sympathy”
—especially sham sympathy—could just as well
have been expressed per medium of a sixpenny
stamp, an envelope, a piece of paper, and a high
decimal’s worth of ink, as of an expensive cable- ’
gram paid for with loan-money and sent purely as
an advertisement for the old posturer who, now
that Macdonald has cleared out, stands alone as a
political humbug. However, “ the Hempire” ha*
to be considered.
In the very first speech uf N.S.W. the
electoral campaign Parkes said the one thing that
everybody knew to a certainty Parkes would say.
“ The men who voted against me,” he declared,
“ must be taken to have voted against Local
Government, against the Federation of Australia,
against the abolition of plural voting, and against
the cause of Labour.” The Bulletin has put in
some “h’s” and some lost grammar, but other-
wise that was exactly what the old man asserted.
And what he forgot to say was that his opponents
had declared against clothes because Parkes wore
clothes, and that when they voted the no-
confidence motion they voted that they would
never again have any hair, because the great Hi-
Ham is hairy; and that when they opposed Sir
Henry they also opposed the habit of washing
because Sir Henry washes himself—at least it may
be assumed that he does. But, then, as the old,
grey poet is not the only man on earth who washes
himself this argument falls through; and all the
rest of the arguments break down for just the
same reason.
G. H. Reid says he has looked through
the N.S.W. Statute-book to find an original idea
placed there by Parkes. Re has failed. Of the four
good measures in Parkes’name, the N.S.W, Public
Schools Act was taken from other acts; so with the
Municipalities Act, which was spoiled in being
plagiarised. The Public Works Act was the idea
of W. T. Poole, and the Railway Commissioners’
Act was taken from Victoria. Parkes, however,
has conceived three original ideas. The first was
the proposed Dead-House; the second was to call
N.S.W. “ Australia,” and the most recent one
was that worthy Australians should have peerages
as well as worthy men in England. In 1884, in
the Nineteenth Centuky, Parkes advocated
Imperial Federation, and suggested that the
names of the colonies should be dropped and that
they should be called 1 ‘ The British States of
Australia also that they should be welded
together by peerages. A true and damning in-
dictment.
Thus Gov. Hopefcoun, to Melbourne
Chamber of Commerce
It is not necessary for us to consider what would happen
if a great (British) naval disaster were to occur. Any-
thing short of absolute perfect success at sea, anything
short of our (the British) flag being triumphant, must
ruin all our trade, starve the people at home, and ulti-
mately break up the British Empire.
The mantle of Balaam in the matter of enforced
but reluctant prophecy hath descended upon
Hopetoun.
A memo, accompanying the letter notify-
ing the date of the annual dinner of the Victorian
Employers’ Union is marked “private,” and runs
thus;—
Dear Sir,—l do trust that on this occasion you will
make a special effort to be present with a friend or two,
It is highly desirable, for obvious reasons, that we should
make a “ good show.” Kindly let me know by. Saturday,
13th, how many ticketsyon will require.—Yours faithfully
Eredk. Humphries (Secretary).
Why is a “good show ” especially necessary just
now ?
One man, one vote,
Old or new coat;
One man, one soul—
One head, one poll.
One voice, one heart;
One race, one start;
One die, one shake —
One chance, one stake.
One end, one aim—
One limp, one lame
Same truths, same fibs—•
One Parkes, one Bibbs.

The late Edward Broadhurst, Q.C., was
conducting a case in Sydney Supreme Court, J.
B. Darvall being on the other side. A witness
was being examined by him, and a question of age
cropped up. “ What is So-and-So’s age?” asked
Broadhurst. “lam not a good judge of people’s
age,” was the reply. “Well, give a guess,” said
the barrister. ‘ 1 Look at my learned friend and
say which you think is the adulterer of the two.”
Everybody knew Darvall’s proclivities, and the
hit told so well that even the Court laughed.
Deakin’s lecture on orthodoxy, to the
Melbourne University Union, Wilson Hall, last
week, was uncommonly good. All the time he
was sparring at, and thrusting his rapier around,
the most cherished convictions of his hearers. His
late trip to India inspired the address. No other
Victorian is so gifted, with his combination of
politics and culture, but he will do the kootoo to
political orthodoxy, instead of leading Young
Australia. The lecture seems to be a reminder
that he has cast the slough of spiritualism, in
every shape, and is as hard a shell, as Gillies —
or Munro, who prescribes the cold-water cure for
everything.
Parkes, in lately defending his acceptance
of a title, said that before agreeing to take the
“handle*,” he consulted, amongst other distin-
guished personages, Sir John Robertson—leaving
it thereby to be inferred that old Jack Robertson
was altogether disinterested in the matter. Now,
the fact is that Parkes and Robertson were
offered distinctions simultaneously and were not
on speaking terms at the time, nor had they
spoken forayear. But the joy of the pair at the offer
of the Imperial bribes brought them together, and
they actually unbent to the extent of indulging in
a conversation behind the Speaker’s chair on the
subject dearest to their hearts, the result being,
of course, that Jack told Henry to take it, and
that Henry gave similar advice to Jack.
There’s a delicious article in the last
MAcwillaN on that French poetic genius, De
Bartville, just departed.
We hear that Dentist J. I. Marshall covets
parliamentary honours. He doubtless excels in
his own profession; but “Ne sutar supra
crepidam.” Stick to the last friend.
“Old To-Morrow” Macdonald is dead,
aud Canada will never grow another groveller
like him. He was a large and oily man, and his
picture in the evening papers looks like a bird of
prey partly smothered in a blanket. Also he was
a bowling* Tory, a profound wallower before his
beloved Queen, an individual who promised every-
thing to everybody and never gave anything to
anybody, a person of boundless and unfathomable
snuffle, and of such is the kingdom of heaven.
He served his monarch faithfully and died in
harness, for his last public acts consisted in
judiciously faking the electoral rolls so *s to
knock off over 100,000 votes from the democratic
party, and in procuring the rejection of a Bill
providing for the introduction of the One-Man-
One-Yote principle throughout the Dominion.
His friends said that he was a zealous patriot, and
his enemies said that Judas Iscariot and Gehazi
and Ananias all combined weren’t a patch on him
for lying; and the truth was most likely about
half-way between these two assertions. R.I.P,
A light and cheerful American lie is just
now going round the press concerning a gentle-
man who cleaned out all the portable goods,
jewellery, and liquors of a certain Mexican town
by means of hypnotism. He wandered through
the streets, and fixed his evil eye on every citizen
who seemed to have assets, and about an hour
afterwards the inhabitants began to call in and
give him their watches, clothes, furniture, and
brio-a-brao generally. Unfortunately, ten excited
gentleman visited him with a rope and asked an
explanation, and instead of freezing them up with
his baleful optic and taking all their attire off
them, he abandoned his plunder and fled from the
scene. The average hypnotic lie always seems to
come to a lame and impotent ending like this.
If hypnotism were the power it is cracked up to
be the professor of the art would go round and
petrify banks with his mysterious art, and get
forty separate overdrafts ; or he would stun hotels-
with his unholy device, and get free board and
lodging, and gratis liquor; or floor wealthy
capitalists, and make them hand over the accum-
ulated loot. But in real life, instead of this he
hires someseedy person to eat candles and rush
after imaginary rats on the stage, while he collars
the scanty gate-money; and this feebleness of
purpose gives him away. Once, however, them
came to Sydney a hypnotist who aimed at higher
things than these, arid he broke down miserably.
He got a well-known George-street hatter to go*
under the ‘‘influence ” at a public exhibition, and
put him through the customary performance.
Next day a wealthy patron wanted a private
exhibition of the magician’s powers, and he took
him along to the hatter’s shop, and, standing out-
side, commanded the “ subject ” to rush out.
Having once come under the will of the operator
he ought to have been seized on the instant with
a hidden prompting of some sort, and to have
issued forth, dragged by invisible hands ; but he
didn’t issue worth a cent. The hypnotist sawed
the air and made passes, but no one came. He
kept it up for about half an hour, and it began to
rain, and still there were no results. Finally they
;gpt so wet that they couldn’t stand it any longer,
so they went into the shop and inquired for the
patient, and then it transpired that he had left
for Melbourne that morning. The story breaks
off short just there, for no one knows whether the
hatter would have rushed out or not, supposing
he had been present. Most likely he wouldn’t.
We have received the following from “ A
Bluejacket ”
Dear Bulletin, — Early last year you published a few
lines in re a stoker who was discharged from the Victorian
navy because he would not shave his moustache. This
moustache business has cropped .up agaih. Yesterday 1
whs discharged from the Victorian navy by the Naval
Commandant, Captain Mann, because I would, not shave
off my moustache. lam a Victorian by birth, have been
in the navy for 20 months, have borne a good 'character,
have qualified as first-class signalman and seaman-gunner
at the expense of the public, and how have been dis-
charged without a moment’s notice for the above “reason.”
There are about twenty others similarly holding out, and
they are to be discharged, one or two at a time, as men
are got to fill their p-laces. Melbourne, 2nd June, 1891.
From what it knows of Australian public temper.
The Bulletin conceives that this absurd piece of
petty tyranny has only to be mentioned to be
squashed. It would be as reasonable to order
that each man should consent to be ear-marked as
that he should consent to be shaved. Such ukases
may be all very well for the vagrant-department of
gaols.
It is necessary in these days to be always
on your guard against shoddy. No genuine
article comes upon the market now but what
hundreds of unscrupulous traders immediately
commence to imitate and defraud the public by
base and worthless imitations. This has been
more especially the case with Clements Tonic
than with any other article of commerce. The
wonderful therapeutical power of this patent
remedy, has achieved such unprecedented suc-
cess during the last two years, that there is
scarcely a store but what stocks some imitation
for sale to the suffering public, when the
genuine article is demanded ; could anything
be more despicable, is it possible to realise how
debased and jnean a man (who claims to be
educated and a gentleman) must be before he
will trifle with the sufferings of unfortunate
men and women ? And all for the sake of a
few pence extra profit; he knows perfectly
well that he cannot make an article which
would do one tenth the good in diseased
organisms that Clements Tonic does. He
knows that even while he is imposing on his
confiding customer, that he is doing worse than
picking his pocket, for he is betraying the
confidence which the patient places in him. It
is impossible to realise anything meaner or more
despicable. All are not like this ; thank God,
there are honorable men who would scorn to
impose upon their customers, but at the same
time it is absolutely necessary for the public
to be warned against the vampires who pV;ey on
the trust of their patrons, and it is the duty of
every man to expose every case of imposition
or substitution. An honest chemist will hand
you Clements Tonic when you demand it, if he
tries to sell you a substitute,? shun him and
warn your friends against him. Mr. W. Sim-
mons, Sandhurst, Vic., writes under date,
September 19, ’9o:—“Dear Sir,-—For the last
four years I have suffered gri'eat misery from
nervous debility, complicated with liver and
kidney disease, my water was scalding hot and
very scant and muddy. I had sharp shooting
pains all over my body, was very weary, always
tired and languid, with no appetite and fre-
quent attacks of vomiting and headaches. I
rose in a morning more tired than when I went
to bed and was so constipated that I had to
take the most violent cathartics. I consulted
doctors without number and all without benefit,
until my wife persuaded me to use Clements
Tonic. The first three bottles did not seem to
have much effect, but after that I seemed to get
relief daily and a three months course so com-
pletely restored my health, that now I feel as
if I had been born again or translated to an
entirely new sphere of existence. I was never
so well before and feel as strong as a lion and
can perform any reasonable amount of exertion
without fatigue ;• yon can easily understand
bow grateful I am to your wonderful remedy,,
for it- is wonderful that it should have cured
my case which had baffled the best, medical
skill these colonies afford. Long live Clements
Tonic ! say I, others may doubt its. value if
they like, I have proved it genuine.,”

The Bulletin sympathises with Gordon-
Cumramg to the extent that he has pot been given
a fair trial. Long after the baccarat-trouble had
been raised, and just before the case came on for
bearing, the Prince of Wales,- as the world knows,
nominated, as a member of thesu'per-exclusive Marl-
borough Club, young Wilson, the scapegoat witness
for the women whom Gordon-Cummingwas sueing
for s’auder. Why'should Wilson, who, with other
members; of hi? family, was, to Wales’ personal
knowledge, just as much on his trial as Gordon-
Cumming, have,, a big social distinction thus
ostentatiously conferred upon him at such a
critical time? Did licit the royal spieler, in per-
forming such an act, deliberately throw his huge
social influence into the scales against Camming?
Did he ; not by that act necessarily intimate
that he believed Camming to be it swindler
and Wilson an innocent ? And ; how looks
the conduct Cof the First' Gentleman of
the Realm in thus committing a cowardly but
unpunishable contempt of court, in view of the
fact that when put into the witness-box he
declared, that lie knew nothing against Gumming
of his ojvn knowledge, but had only found' him
guilty oh hearsay evidence ? The Prince of Wales
has, in this matter, acted a part which would dis-
credit the reputation of a three-card practitioner
or a professional dice-loader.
: # * » V .j 72
Wales’ action in sending his eldest suii'and
Iteir to stop with the Wilsons while the Gordon-
Cumming action was still pending was another
rascally attempt to influence public opinion. The
fact that the engagement to visit had been made ere
the trouble began., is no palliation of such an
offence on the part of the head of British society.
•1 # * *
In a word, Gordon-Cumming has ; so far
as Wales goes, been Welshed.

this miserable story, iil Which the male head Of the
mean, mentally-diseased and dissipated Hbuse of
Guelph isjshbwn Up ris a fieedy, greedy gambler
who patronises the most odious parvenus because
they lend or give him money, even paying his
losses at the card-table, would have been for
GordomCumming, on the delicacy of the verdict,
to crunch in his mouth a prussic-acid globule.
But no, he is straightway married by Miss Garner,
the wealthy N.Y. heiress '(sister of the rich young
man drowned years ago by spreading the. sails of
his yacht while she was double anchored) who
nobly refuses to accept his offer to release her
from their engagement.

The Chief-Justice of England, in summing-
up the baccarat case, repeated to the world that
venerable snuffle that there is “but one law alike
for the peasant and the prince.” He omitted to
mention, however, that there are precisely four
thousand and one different ways of administering
that law.
# # » y
The; drollest result of the baccarat scandal
has been the treating of poor Tummy as a military
offender. This is especially comic in the case of
German newspapers, which positively snort at the
notion of a field-marshal gambling with bis subal-
terns. Now, the most devoted adherent ofApyalty
in all; its mock capacities has never sßiolisly
thought of Albert Edward as a real soldier, or
imagined that his fugitive appearances at the head
of a brigade were inoonsisteilt with a pack of
cards and a dice-box in the -crown of his cocked
hat. Neither has the toy-warrior himself asserted
any claims to pre-emineifce >th- thfe art of war; or
pretended that his sodl fle\\H?to bugle>'s
call. In point oFfact* Tummy’s equerries have
sometimes found itdifficult toconvince their royal
master that England ‘expected every field-marshal
to doffiis duty, and on sevebal Occasions he has
been finable to le.ad the troops in consequence of
his tunic being six inches top small round the
girth/and his medals having been left behind at
the last country mansion where he used them as
counters. Wherefore The v Bulletin desires 'to
sympathise with its future king in his present
absurd dilemma, whilst also reminding him that
a person who plays with Odffid tools must be chary
of using them to cut tlifi cards when ladies are
about. At the same time we feel sure'that Tummy
will make the best of a bad job, and console him-
self by reflecting that h J may retire from the ser-
vice, Sf necessary,.without endangering the wel-
fare of an Empire 011 which the siin never sets.
The pflice band lias been engaged. to : raise a
tumult at various elections, or it would now play

The lion-hunters of Melbourne Sdfft letters
by the bushel to Mr. and Mrs. Gpppin, begging
for cards of invitation-to that Sunday “At
Home,” where La Grande Bernhardt was an-
nounced to star in private. It' was not intended
as a sassiety function, however, and consequently
a number of applicants had to wring their hands
in distress while visitors from Bohemia were bow-
ing reverently before the divinity. Madame took
her greatness, in good part, for she has been
appearing in good parts these’ many years, but
when George Ashton (who represented Host
Coppin, laid aside by the gout) suggested that she
should drop into a kind of throne on a raised dais,
the prospect seemed to alarm Sara, so she took a
chair beside Mrs. C. like any ordinary mortal.
Later on, though, when she saw there was no
deep-laid scheme for crowning her with laurels or

when Greville was introduced as first mate to the

Scotch explorer, who discovered Van Diemen’s

Samuel Blank Blank, of newspaper-can-
vassing fame, appears to have installed himself in
the billet of aide-de-camp 'to Sai’a Bernhardt.
Anyway, Samuel opened the door of her carriage
and saw Sara off, so to speak, as she left
the ‘ Princess’s after the first performance of
“ Cleopatra.” It was midnight. Two rows of
curious lingerers reached from either side of the
stage-doorway to the kerb, and in a commanding
position next to Sara’s brougham, with his bell-
topper neatly balanced on his massive brow, and
a cigar between his teeth, waited Samuel. “She
coraeth not,” he seemed to be saying to himself.
Now and again he would speak to the coachman,
apparently giving instructions as to the proper
way of driving the distinguished burden when she
should be lodged insideA The onlookers \vere
deeply impressed by Samuel’s air of authority,
and whilst some of them whispered that he was
Messrs. Abbey and Grau, others thought he must
be the Cos. to Williamson and Garner. His
masterful repose persuaded all who didn’t happen
to know Samuel that he was there by special
appointment with Sara. He was evidently right
on the job either by invitation or otherwise.
At last Sara emerged from the Princess’
side entrance and tripped across the pave-
ment, followed by a couple of ladies,
With Marc .Antony in attendance. Samuel
turned the handle of the carriage-door, ad-
mitted the ladies, and then shoved his hand
through the open window. Very likely Sara
shook his aggressive paw just to get rid of it—she
couldn’t well help herself, anyway. Marc Antony
managed to make his adieux with some difficulty,
because the other gentleman was pervading the
situation, and then found, just as the carriage
cleared off, that the indomitable Samuel was
grabbing hold of his hand. It is embarrassing
for a stranger in a strange land to be seized upon
in this manner, so Antony tore himself away from
Samuel with a mystified smile and escaped down
the street. Some men might have felt themselves
“left” under the circumstances, but Mr. Blank
meandered in the direction of the tramway-line,
looking radiantly happy. He had come to the
fore on an interesting occasion. Nobody wanted
him there, as far as the present historian could
discover, but Samuel had come all the same. You
can’t keep gentlemen of his temperament in the
background. On the Day of Judgment we shall
expect to discover Samuel offering his hand to the
Lord and remarking that the weather keeps fine.

The dames of the Austral Salon plume
themselves considerably on the fact that one
participatress in this movement for the higher
. education of woman has a fascinating pair of legs.
At that weary welcoming to Lady Hopetoun the
legs were included in an alleged dance associated
with one of the Tennysonian tableaux, and the
anxiety to see what her ladyship thought of them
was painfully intense. The"whole Salon resembled
a fond mother showing' off her twins. Such
female pride in another girl’s chaste extremities
never was seen before, and every time they kicked
more prominently than usual a dull murmur of
many voices reverberated through the Hibernian
Hall. The worshippers of those golden calves
were saying to one another : “ What a pity His
Excellency couldn’t come U Meanwhile" His
Excellency’s wife was dissimulating her satisfac-
tion at the gentleman’s.absence from a dangerous
position, and wondering how soon the higher edu-
cation of woman will soar above the knee.

“J. A. Packer,” writing in Sydney D.T.
under the heading of “The black list of the
churches,” arraigns two alleged adulterous N.S.
Wales politicians, M‘Rae and Alex. Hutchinson,
as social lepers who should be ostracised by the
electors. It is convenient for persons of the
Packer kidney to omit from their godly little lists
all mention of a certain politician who ran two
wives at once and had a large family by the young
one while the old one was still alive. Such cant-
ing letters only damn “the great N.S.W. Freetrade
party,” and we are quite sure that “the board”
of Sydney D.T, don’t want to do that .

of no other N.S.W. politician but Parkes afore-
said. We wonder what'particular “rights’’the
old gentleman in question is prepared to give
women that they should so gush over him ?

ruled that sufficient cruelty had not been proved.
It is interesting to know that the Victorian defini-
tion of “legal repeated adultery” is “adultery
with more than one person.” So that any Vic-
torian is at liberty to keep a harem cf one and
possibly two, provided lie is not legally cruel to
his legal wife.

Henry Brett, of Auckland, M.L. (Maori-
land), having an ambition to supply people with
pure literature, illustrated, started a weekly under
the title, The Graphic and Ladies’ Companion.
In a recent issue appeared a picture with an
obscure interpolation, which has simply shaken
Maoriland to its foundations. It is surmised that
the interpolation was the work of the devil. The
worst of it was that the whole edition was in
print ere the trouble was discovered.

Said Justice Hodges, of Melbourne, to a
male applicant for divorce, who had, when 17
years of age, married a woman of 21 years, and who
had been frequently skull-dragged and pokered
by his spouse “I don’t believe in boys marrying
and then coming to this Court for relief,” and
judgment was reserved for a fresh poker-effect.
Which recalls an incident in the life of old Dr.
Broinby at Melbourne Grammar School. Avery
smart society youth, whose education was not yet
complete, and who had got married suddenly
(to a society girl, who has since divorced him with

and then deposited them with a certain bank.
Next day he called in at the bank and asked for a
loan of the papers, as he wished to make some
extracts from them. The manager, having the
most perfect confidence in him, without demur let
him have the securities—which he at once took
and pawned with another bank. The second bank
registered its mortgage. Then our friend turned
up at the second bank, got a loan of the
deeds as before, and returned them to bank
No. 1. Some time afterwards he turned
up just at the second bank’s closing time,
and sat on the edge of the table in the office
of the manager amiably conversing with that
potentate and wasting much time. Presently the
manager said he had to oatcli his train instanter,
whereupon the speculator : “You had better put
this into the safe handing him a brown-paper
parcel containing something about the size of the
mortgaged and “ borrowed ” deeds. The manager
grabbed the packet, slung it into the safe and
idammed the door kerslap. The deeds weren’t in
the brown-paper parcel, hut that fact wasn’t dis-
covered for quite a long while.
The same smarty raised money from a
bank on mortgage witli the assistance of a photo-
graph of tlie mortgaged property—a house and
ground. Such business, of course, was rather lax,
but then, you see, the bank-manager really
believed in his customer, and had strong prima-
facie reason for thinking that the latter was
in a position far above any small couple-of-
thonsand-pound fraud. To show how trustworthy
the operator was in his financing, it may be men-
tioned that he pulled down the fence in front of
the mortgaged house and had it re-photographed
from a slightly different point of view, and re-
mortgaged it in the same place as another house !
And yet many of his friends say he’s not half a
bad fellow, and not a quarter as black as he’s
painted !
VERY LIKELY,
THE FAT POLICEMAN : “After a desperate chase round eight streets and a sevare shtruggle,
in the coorso of which he tore me uniform seven toimes, I arrested the pris’ner,
yer Wortchip.”
The Melbourne Anglican Cathedral collec-
tion-plates have a wire meat-cover grill over them
to prevent —well, we presume they mistrust the
plate-holders, for who expects a grab from a pew-
holder? There is a lot of human nature in that
holy meat-cover.

Agnes Moore, a sweet young bush damsel,
of Huntley (N.S.W.), has Just been favoured by
Acting-Judge Bennett, at Orange District Court,
with £4O damages and costs against Edward
Goodwin Agland for breach of promise of mar-
riage. Edward was foolish enough to reduce
specifically to writing his intentions, thus :
I, Edward Agland, son of .lames Agland, promise to
marry Agnes Moore at any time the father of the said
Agnes Moore may appoint.
As Agnes said that Ted was “the only one she
ever loved or walked with,” not all the contradic-
tions that Edward made, nor his assertions that
the girl’s father and mother frightened him into
signing the above document, in a Gordon-Cum-
ming-like manner, availed with Judge Bennett.
Such is love.

As already hinted by The Bulletin, a 26
year-old Ballarat lady, a graduate of Melbourne
University, is about to marry the venerable Mr.
Henry Halloran, C.M.G., late Under-Secretary
for N.S.W. That makes Henry’s third. We are
getting an epithalamium ready. These poets,
particularly the sonneteers, play fearful havoc
with women’s hearts.

In the N.S.W. Insolvency Court, Mrs.
Gardiner, formerly wife of the “Rev,” Andrew
Gardiner, last week deposed that, after her father’s
death in ’B2, the furniture purchased by him for
her was sold, and the proceeds taken by her genial
husband, who never accounted for the money.
They thereafter lived with her mother, who paid
o
snakes which he caught in the Blue Mountains,
and the solemn, soulful Cockney swallows all his
assertions whole. There would be a very poor-
show in this country for a returned Australian
fossil who tried to gibber about the storks and
albatrosses he caught on the Thames, and the
rhinoceros and the great, ferocious winkle that he
hunted in the gloomy forests of Islington; but
the free and independent Briton is a receptacle
for every wild horse-lie that comes along. And
yet he is filled with pity for the ignorance of the
miserable foreigner, because that foreigner doesn’t
know everything.

Accusds from Mildura, Vic., who are com-

“superior ” criminal from Mildura costs Victoria
at least £IOO to convict or discharge.

The Bulletin does not think that the
N.S.W. Barmaids’ and Waitresses’ Union will
amount to much so far as the first-named is con-
cerned. The stylish barmaid (and all barmaids
try hard to be stylish) will, you may be sure, not
join in the ruck, and will elect to play.a lone hand.
The smart barmaid is always fairly independent
and can change her employer whenever she
pleases.

Apropos to The Bulletin’s cremation
query, “What is the matter with quicklime?” a
correspondent—“ H.M.”—points out that the use
of quicklime, though it would probably make our
cemeteries last as long again, would simply defer
the nuisance and evil caused by their becoming
too populously stocked. “ H.M.” prophesies that
in another 20 years the Devonshire-street ceme-
tery, Sydney—which has already been closed
several years—will have altogether disappeared,
while the memorial headstones raised by loving
hands will have been utilised by shinbone and
flourbag Aldermen for economical pitching and
paving purposes. He holds the suggested “sani-
tary coffin,” though a much-needed sanitary
reform, to be “ only a compromise; and, in fact,
the insertion of the thin end of the wedge of
cremation pure and simple, which is to burst up
the undertakers and all other churchyard ghouls-
w ho batten on the misery and sorrow of bereaved
ones.”

Consumption v. “Microbe
Killer.”
Radam’s Microbe Killer Co. Gentlemen,—l
wish to add my testimonial to the many others as
I have been suffering for the last twelve months
with lung disease. Have tried all medicines for
the lungs, but all failed to do me good, and I have
been with doctors for a long time; but I got
weaker every day, and my debtor told me my left
lung was no good to me, and that I should never
get any better. I got that weak I believed I could
not live long in such a state, but was recommended
to try your Microbe Killer, and ever since I have
been improving; in fact the change is wonderful,
I have taken one jar and part of another, and I
begin to feel quite strong again. I believe a few
more jars will make a certain cure of me. I
recommend it everywhere I go, as I know the
value of its use, and will be glad to give anyone
information who likes to see me, as I believe it
will cure all diseases; not only that of the lungs,
but all if taken in time. I am yours truly,

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ It was the summer of ’4s,’’ started the Captain,
as we gathered closer to hear him. “I was
skipper and part-owner of the old Ariell, just
arrived from Liverpool,” he continued, “and had
that afternoon come up to Melbourne to get money
to pay off my crew. Just after sundown I started
to walk home to my ship, lying at Sandridge pier,
with the money in my great-coat pocket. I kept
both hands in my pockets—one to hold the cash
bags and the other as a sort of balance like. I
went along the Sand ridge-road and a different
place it was then—there were no factories, nor
shops, nor timber-yards, nothing but sand and
scrub. Well, about half-a-mile from town I made
out a man walking on ahead. He was going slow
and I soon caught him. I hailed him with ‘ Good
evening, mate.’ ‘ Good evening,’ says he, and we
walked along together.
“He was not a seafaring man, I perceived, and
as I had never seen him before I’d much rather
not have met him, especially as I had such a lot of -
money aboard. However, I kept my eyes open
and took a good grip of the bags in my pocket.
Just as the lights of Sandridge hove in sight the
man stopped and asked me for a match, saying
his pipe was out. Still keeping my right hand on
my money I searched my pockets with my left,
and gave him one. He took the match but
seemed as though he didn’t care to smoke any
more, for he looked at it and then at me, and
then turned quickly off into the scrub without
saying a word. I was a bit puzzled at the time,
but I thought no more of the man after getting on
board and turning in, glad and thankful to have
my money safe.
Next morning, after I came ashore, I met a
couple of policemen with a man walking between
them handcuffed. He looked up as I came near
and recognised me. ‘ Hallo!’ said I, ‘ that's your
sort, is it ?’ ‘Do you know him?’ said one of the
constables. * Know him ?’ says I. ‘ Well, I met
him only last night on the Sandridge-road.’ ‘ It’s
lucky you don’t know him,’ said he; ‘he’s Jim
Baxter, wanted for the Flinders-street murder.
‘ Yes,’ growled the prisoner, turning to me, ‘An’if
I’d only been sure you hadn’t a pistol in that hand
you kept in your pocket, there might ha’ been
another murder ! Oh, take it down, Jarvie,’
said he, turning to the constable, ‘you can have
the evidence, and be hanged to you.’ "’
“ The next time I saw him he was riding in a
cart down Collins-street, handcuffed, and seated
on a coffin. ”
“ ‘ On a coffin ?’ ” interrupted several voices.
“Yes, they were taking him up to Russell-
street to hang him.”

(TO THE EDITOR OF “ THE AUSTRALIAN STAR.”)
Sir,—Will you, through your widely-circulated
paper, inform me and the general public if it is a
fact that “ Tattersall George Adams ” has disposed
of the whole or part of his interest in the well,
known lattersall’s sweep, and that it is now
carried on by a syndicate of Sydney people ? If a
syndicate have it in hand will it be conducted in
the fair and square manner that it was snvmosed
to be when George Adams had it himself.—Yours,
&c - A SUBSCEIBER.

met a corpse at the gate of that particular part of the

in the bush,” as it was not going to be buried in his little
graveyard. There is nothing in this venerable story to
make a fuss over. People hold membership of churches
on certain conditions, of which they are or ought to be
perfectly aware, and they know that‘if they do not in life
conform to the regulations made and provided, they are
liable to be “ buried in the bush,*’ or have other indignities
offered their clay. The man who, by the non-observance
of certain outward forms, has admittedly travelled on
whah his particular spiritual adviser told him was the
ro ad to the devil, has simply arranged that the bearers of
his corpse shall meet the devil, in the shape of the
spiritual adviser aforesaid, at the graveyard gate ...

Reynolds at any railway-bookstall unless the clerk in

degradation to a citizen as the scaffold, you might let us
know why, while no citizen can be hanged without going
before a jury, a couple of mere blustering, ignorant magis-
trates, appointed only because they happen to be some-
one’s uncle or cousin, should by law have the power to
order an accused man to be flogged right away? For our
own part, we regard so undemocratic a law with unutter-
able horror and loathing, and cordially detest as brutal
tyrants all Australian members of Parliament and all
other persons who have ever taken part in making or re-

From the newspaper reports it would
appear that when Mr. Higgs, of the N.S.W.
Trades and Labour Council, feels very disgusted
he “gets a pain in the stomach.” There are,
therefore, three alternatives before Mr. Higgs :
either to boiler-plate his conscience so that he will
never be disgusted, to electro-plate his stomach,
to avoid the results of disgust—or to keep out of
Parliament.
The Christchurch (M.L.) licensing com-

as near prohibition as the law allows, and has re-
fused many licenses. A teetotal licensing-bench

which, in nine cases out of ten, is merely a con-
spiracy against law and justice, and in favour of
some pal of its own.
The “ Cup ’’Blend a marvellous tea in the cup.
The re-appearance of M'Elhone on the
N.S.W. political warpath revives the memory of
the good old day when he stood and was elected
for East Sydney. The gentle John was then a
warm, not to say torrid, supporter of the Dailey-
Stuart Government, and Dailey wrote for him his
address to the electors; The “shirtsleeved
Caesar ” was in that particular the most good-
natured soul alive. His facile pen was at all
times at the service of any acquaintance who was
in difficulties over a speech or an article, a
characteristic known and availed of by all sorts
and conditions of men, from Governor Loftus up
to the budding journalist who wanted to round off
an obituary or give a classical turn to a subleaderor
a review. However, Mac. couldn’t be comfortable
for long on the right of the Speaker. A few days
or weeks of the session drove him to his only
possible resting-place the Opposition benches
where he foregathered with A. G. Taylor and
became a thorn of a very bad kind in the side of
the Government. Something had to be done, and
the Government put up Dan O’Connor to do it.
Dan’s speech, needless to say, was wordy and
rambling, but no one who heard it is likely to
forget the unexpected and startling power of its
conclusion. The man he was attacking positively
cowered and grew livid under the sting of the
blistering peroration that came to a merciless
climax in a discharge of all the venom
which could be concentrated into the two words,
“political Quilp! ” Now, the polished, apt
brutality of these words it would be vain to try
to make properly clear to anybody who has not
lived in New Soxrth Wales. It is almost unneces-
sary to add that the manuscript of the peroration
in Dan’s notes was in the handwriting of W. B.
Dailey. The little comedy didn’t end there. The
future Postmaster-General himself became discon-
tented with something or other—the postal policy
of the Goverment, perhaps—-and found himself
in his turn compelled to cross the floor. Dailey,
who represented the Government in the Upper
House, had thereupon the misfortune to do some-
thing which caused the blocking of O’Connor’s
pet Sydney Corporation Bill, and the air grew
black with thunder once again. The last act was
short and sharp. A furiom onslaught in the
Assembly, in which Dan made a graceful affusion
to Dailey’s parentage, evoked a withering sen-
tence or two which, though it didn’t deign to be a
reply, would have made even a laughing jackass
wilt and droop and hold his tongue. A Sydney
pressman, by the way, has a story which gives
Dan away pretty badly over that same speech
against M'Elhone. When it was over, he (the
pressman) went downstairs from the gallery to fill
in a word which he was not quite sure he had
correctly caught. “ What was that last expres-
sion you used, Mr. O'Connor—* political whelp ’ ?”
“No,” said Dan, turning up the manuscript,
“‘political Quilp.’ Bui put ‘whelp,’ it's abetter
word /”
A “Government House Young Man."
Dear Bullock Team, I take exception to
two adjectives in your “Plain English ” of June
6th. Before coming to them I must tell you how
I read The Bulletin.
First. —Headings, in order to see whether there
is any stuff for me. Excerpt from Bush Book-
shonary : —Stuff : Cash, money ; 2, medicine ; 3,
vide other lexicographers.
Next.—Pictures, i.c., drawings. N.B.—l’m
certain that Ashton has a wife.
Thirdly.—Plain English. N. Optissimc. This
is my present dart.
Fourthly, and lastly, as we say inth epoopit. —l
go through ads., leaders, pars., Sappho, and all
usque ad finem.
To get back to the scent, just as my dogs
Snooks and Minnie do (best dogs in N.S.W.), I
call your attention to No. 3. Up to date all has
been padding to you, but for the multitude it is
explanatory matter.
, Now, you rise the word “ Scotch ” in, to say the
least of it, an equivocal manner. Is not a Scotch-
man as good as anyone else and a d d sight
better? I refer to the words: “A Government
House young man with merely a Scotch letter of
introduction.” Hang you, I’m Scotch.
To continue —“Any gented boarding-house.”
A boarding-house can’t be genteeh and genteel is
not a genteel word. It’s a Styx of a word.
Still I perceive the little “ granum salis” that
pervades your article : “Trades Hall and Govern-
ment House.”
As I have advanced in years I have wondered
why I was always looked upon with more favour
than my two elder brothers. At first I thought it
was because I was clever; and that’s another con-
temptible word.
But my brother Jack Was, perhaps, the] best
mathematician of his day and ran the blockade
three or four times as an engineer when the steam-
kettles of his boat Were close-up dangerous.
And Jim was a most moral young man. He,
like me, was a soldier, and, from what I have
heard, a good onei He was not killed in action-
on the contrary, lie was murdered by leaky huts
and cold at the Curragh, where he had to make
room for My Lords Champagne and Stomjack,
who were then in the first blaze of their devilry
(good enough fellows, both of them).
But I, the third, combining the mathematics of
my elder with the neat manners (not morals) of
my second brother, was the show- boy. And why ?
I’ll tell you. Being of a Tory family, unfor-
tunately they taught me logic. Consequently I
sneered at the petty grandiosity of instituted
customs and was teckoned “ verra neer daft.”
When I sang “ We’ll hae nae king but Charlie,”
I substituted “Barley.” But God gifted me with
memory and reason. Whilst the late Lord Advo-
cate was studying in his room I was looking for
nests and whatever else is to be found “within a
mile o’Edinboro’ toon,” and—became a soldier.
Then entered Satan into my heart and I allowed
myself to swagger, with sword and sabretasche
and jingly spurs, down Waterloo Place even unto
the palace of St. James. From that day dated
my ruin ; Iliad become “a Government House
young man.” And still I sneered and was put
down as peculiar (good word that). But my
people — my people because my brothers died —a
race who, holding their heads above the local
aristocracy, because they cuild sway the electorate,
and respected by the workers, because they em-
ployed a hundi’ed men in the most noble of
all charities, the making of whisky ; these people,
my people, caught the infection of toadyism and
laid up to me, the Government House young man.
Here I will say that the common people liked me
because I was a “ deevil for huntin’, an’fushin’,
an’ rid in’, an] the lassiesand therefore, thusly I
am a Republican and a sinner, waiting peacefully
for that time when Republics, Commonwealths
and Royalty will cease to interest
Your very attached friend,
SCOTTY THE WRINKLER.

don and Derrick Vaughan may do, I never

A MOST EXTRAORDINARY STATE-
MENT.
A MODERN MIRACLE.
To the Editor of the Wellington (Salop)
Journal.
Dear Sir, —In your paper of October 20 I saw
the account of what 1 considered a most extra-
ordinary statement, wherein “Mrs. Mary Ann
1' os ter, of 48, Greenfield-terrace, Gateshead, had
be 3ii cured of rheumatism in the limbs in 15
minutes by using St. Jacobs oil.” Now, this
statement of itself seems incredible, but when the
article stated, further, that “for a long time her
legs had been so stiff that she could not sit up in
bed,” that “the ligaments of her joints seem to
have grown together,” and that “her case was
considered hopeless ” it seemed a miracle Which I,
determined to investigate. I accordingly called
on Mrs. Foster for the purpose of learning the
truth. Judge of my surprise when that lady told
toe that every word was true. She said for
months previous to using the oil she had been
confined to her bed suffering the most excruciating
agony night and day, but that in 15 minutes after
the application she experienced relief from pain,
and in less than a week she was up and about the
house —a well woman. Mrs. Foster says this was
more than 12 months ago and she has not had
any return of the disease. She is as well and
strong as she ever was in her life, and (naturally)
recommends St. Jacobs oil to everybody—in fact,
is a living advertisement for St. Jacobs oil. I
hand you these facts solely for the benefit of the
public, believing that a remedial agent possessing
such wonderful power to conquer pain and relieve
suffering should be made known everywhere. I
am glad to see that your journal, as well as the
press generally, is taking up the matter, which is
quite right.
I remain, yours respectfully,
THOMAS HUTCHKISS.

B EYOND COMPETITION.
The Waterbury Watches take front rank as
“the timekeepers of the day.” They are not
“ English levers ” made in Geneva, and puffed
into notoriety to enforce sales and ensure disap-
pointment. The factory, which is now turning
out over half a million of these watches per
annum—a production larger than that of any
other watch company in the world—is still unable
to keep pace with the demand, and has now
extended its operations into the very heart of the
cheap watch-making territory on the continent
of Europe, where it successfully competes with
these “English levers” on equal terms. These
are no idle boasts, but stubborn facts, and we
challenge the refutation of these assertions. The
Waterburys (series E, J, and L) are only nickel-
plated watches sold at a low figure, but they get
their reputation from live purchasers and not the
owners of dead stock. They are far more reliable
timekeepers than half of the jewelled-all-over-
patent-halfcock-go-as-you-please-back-action-hair-
trigger - compensated - lock - stitch - burglar - baits
made in Switzerland and Germany, and sold as
English levers. The Waterbury'Watches have
nothing to fear from ridicule, no dread of ex-
posure. They are simply what they claim to be,
and defy competition.
These World-famed and time-tried watches may
be obtained from any respectable dealer or store-
keeper thoroughout the colonies. Prices : Series
E, the old favourite, 13s fid ; Series J (gents’ size),
and L (ladies size), the new shortwinding, stem-
winding, and setting marvels, 22s fid each. No
watch sold as a Waterbury is genuine without the
word Waterbury and the interwoven letters W.
W. Cos. printed in fine type upon its dial face.

A FIVE POUND ORGANETTE FOR ONLY £3. ,
W
E are the solo Proprietors for Australasia fir this New and Wonderful
Instrument. Having for many years manufactured and sold enormous
ties of Automatic Reed Organs, Organelles, Ac., it lias ever been our aim t ■ produce at a low Price an Organette capable
ARIETY of TONES, the Organcttes heretofore placed before the Public 1. V mg but a limited compass, and but one range
of tone. While we have given universal
satisfaction, we still have had as onr
motto, “Excelsior,’ ’ and now can exclaim
“Eureka!” because, without increasing
the price of the Orchestral Orgauette
(our latest production) over other
instruments in the market, we have
succeeded in producing the very ACME
■ OF MrsiCALINVENTION.au instru-
ment with as much variety of tone as an
organ costing £25. The illustration gives
you but a faint idea of general make and
finish, but every Orchestral Organette is
supplied with 28 FULL SIZED
AMERICAN ORGAN REEDS, the same
size and quality as those used in a cabinet
organ. The reeds are placed in a novel
manner over a double suction bellows,
and are controlled by THREE STOPS,
as follows, viz., Flute, Expression and
Vox Humana. The music is produced by
’ perforated sheets, which pass around the
Organette in endless bands, enabling
a tune to bo played over and over
again without stopping, furnishing
the GRANDEST ORCHESTRAL
EFFECTS, either in sacred, secular,
dance, or vocal music, affording a rich,
sonorous, and powerful accompaniment
to the voice, requiring absolutely no skill
in the performer, and THE RANGE OF
MUSIC AND TONE IS PRACTICALLY
UNLIMITED. By the manipulation of
the stops, a tone as soft and sweet as a
zephyr, or a loud, long and swelling
melod y may be produced; trills and high
falsetto, as well as reverberating bass,
and all manner of pleasing combinations
at the will of the performer.
We wish to introduce one of these
Orchestral Organettes into every town
and village in Australasia. We cautlbn

A Curious Reminiscence.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Of all the bloomin' awful things, the awfullest I’ve
knowed
In the flye-and-sixty years I’ve bin alive,
Took place at Paddy Doolan’s on the old Jerilda-road, -' l
’Way back in sixty-four or sixty-five.
Old Doolan had a handy man, a useful sort o’ chap,
But a real, right-down tiger for his ruin ;
An’, one day, bein’ tipsy, why he tumbles from a trap,
And cracks his skull, an’ goes to “ kingdom come.”
Well, they sends an’ tells the trooper, an’ the trooper
rides across,
An’, says he, “I’ll have to let the 1 Crowner ’ hear ;”
So they stretches out old Jerry : iij the place he used to
doss—
A tumble-down old shanty at the rear.
I was trampin’ down from Bulga, an’ had just run out of
. grim ;
Rainin’, too, till every rag on me was soaked ;
So,,you bet, 1 wasn’t sorry to pull-up at Doolan’s pub,
On the evenin’ of the day that Jerry croaked.
Well, I’d had my bite o’ tucker an’ a glass or two o’ beer,
An’ was sittin’ there a-flllin’ of my pipe,
When in comes Mad Macarthy an’ Long Jim of Bundaleer,
An’, my word ! hut they was well upon the swipe.
Two strappiri’ big six-footers, an’ as strong as bullocks,
both ;
An’ ripe for any devilment, as well;
The man that interfered with ’em, you just might take
your oath,
Stood a pretty lively chance of catchin’ hell.
Well, they drank an’ laughed an’ shouted, an’ they swag-
gered an’ they swore,
-, Till Macarthy took a notion in his head
That ,ttiey’d make old Jerry drunker than he’d ever bin
before;
“ Yez can’t do that!” says Doolan—“ Jerry’s dead !”
“Dead drunk, you mean!” says Jimmy. “No,” says,
Doolan, “ no, begob !
He’s as dead as he can be —without a lie!
For he tumbled out of Thompson’s trap, right fair upon
his nob.”
Says Macarthy, “ Come, old man, that’s all my eye I”
“Bedad !” says Pat, “then take a light an’go yerselves to
see.
Sure he’s lyin’ in the shed forninst the gate.”
So my nobles gets a candle an’ they tips a wink to me,
An’ out they goes to see if it was straight.
Well, sir, back they comes directly an’ a-laughih’ fit tc
split,
And behind ’em Mother Doolan cryin’ “ Shame !”
And well she might, for there, between the pair of ’em,,
was it —
The clay that used to answer Jerry’s name !
With its head a-hangin’ forward and its legs a-dragguT
loose,
You can bet it was a dreadful sight to see!
And Istarted up to stop’em, but says Doolan, “Where’s:
the use!
They could smash a dozen chaps like you an’ me !”
So they humped their fearsome burden to a corner of the 1
bar,
And propped it on a cask agin the wall; ' •
“What will Jerry drink?” says Jimmy, and Macarthy
says, “Three-star!
For we won’t be mean with Jerry—damn it all!”
Well, sir, Doolan fills three nobblers, an’ Macarthy collars:
one,
And slaps it down before the senseless clay;
Then they bobs their heads to Jerry, an’ says they: “ Old
man, here’s fun ! ”
And punishes their liquors right away.
Then’twas, “Fill’em up again, Pat —fill’em right up to'
the brim !”
Till they’d swallered half-a-dozen drinks a-head;
Then Macarthy stares at Jerry’s glass, an’ then he stares'
at Jim—
-1 “ By the Lord ! ” says he, “ old Jerry must be dead!
“ For it’s five-an’-twenty minutes he has had his pizeiv
there,
And he’s never tried to touch a bloomin’ drop !
So ■you’re right for once, old Doolan ! Have a drink, an’ -
let us square.
For it’s nearly gettin’ time for us to hop.”
So they humped old Jerry back again to where he wis
before—
Mot her Doolan still a-scoldin’ them in vain ;
Then they staggers to their horses that was stand in’ at
the door,
An’ gallops off like madmen through the rain.
ALEXANDER MONTGOMERY.
Those social agitators who are in favor of
placing the Bible as a text-book in the hands of
State School children ought certainly to peruse the
wicked Melbourne Liberator (of June 6). Some-
thing severe must really be done with the
Liberator—or the Bible.
Extract from Carlyle’s “Transit of Czar
Peter ” in his “ Frederick ’’—showing the state off
Russian society in 1717 :
Most of the four hundred so-called ladies of the suite—
mere German serving-maids—had in their arms a baby in
rich dress, and if you asked “Is that yours?” they
answered, “ The Czar did me the honour.” One President
Cocceji and several official gentlemen had to present a
complimentary address. On entering they found his
Czarish Majesty standing between two Russian ladies, one
of his arms round the neck of each ; in which position he
remained all the time Cocceji spoke.
Henniker Heaton high falutes on his
penny ocean postage scheme in the “ Colonial
Year Book” To melt the frozen streams of
sympathy, to strike the shackles from the numbed
limbs of commerce, to annihilate the chilling sense
of distance, to mass the scattered forces of our
race and foster the proud Imperial sentiment-
such aims may well awaken our enthusiasm,
strengthen us against ignorant or interested oppo-
sition and nerve us for the final effort, which shall
add a new and precious privilege to the inalienable
birthright of Englishmen ? ”
The prospectus of the Sydney Deposit
Bank, whose director is Mr. T. S. Richardson, lies:
before us. This institution has introduced a
novelty for public use in the shape of deposit-
notes, which can be purchased by anyone without
giving name or address, while transferrable with-
out endorsement, therefore can be paid away or
given as security, while bearing interest at a high
rate during the time of currency. These notes are
issued from £lO upwards for any term at the fol-
lowing rates : 12 months, 7 per cent. ; 6 months, 6
par cent.; 3 months, 5 percent. But special rates
can be procured fop longer or shorter periods.,
Tlie Bank on fixed deposits allows for 3 years, 9i
per cent. ; 12 months, 8J per cent. ; 6 months, 7g ( ,
per cent.; 3 months, 5£ per cent., and during the
last four year§ a bonus of 1 per cent, has been paid
to all depositors in addition to the current rates on
their deposits;' This is the only Bank in Austra-
lasia that thus divides its profits.

Dear Bulletin, There is surely one
: reform which the Labour party, as soon as it feels
its feet in the various Australian legislatures,
!should undertake, viz., a day-Parliament. The
man of leisure rises at 1 p.m., and would not be
i ready for the House before 4 or 4.30 ; the business
man (the good old member who was so glad to
“serve his country without pay from purely
patriotic motives”) wants the day for making
bargains and gives the fag-end of his time in the
■evening to conserving the privileges of his caste.
A day-Parliament, where men work with clear,
fresh brains, unfuddled by the booze which always
accompanies late hours, is the Parliament for
Labour. The Parliament of South Australia, un-
questionably the most democratic of all the Aus-
tralian States, has always met at 2 p.m., but the
proper hour for a paid democratic Parliament
should be 11 a.m., if not 10. There is one small
side issue to the subject which will appeal to the
spirit of fairness in every Labour member. The
present system allows the newspaper-proprietors to
work their reporters from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in
‘Courts, deputations, meetings, and general work,
:and then to work them from 4 p.m. to midnight
■or 2 a.m. in Parliament.—Yours, &0., X.Y.Z.
In addition to the two land-grant railway B
iin Western Australia on a large scale, there are
several minor lines constructed on the same
principle. The owners of the Jarrahdale timber
■concessions in the south have built their own
irailway, and recently Messrs. Millar Bros,
■obtained the concession to build a line from
Albany to Eorbay—l6 miles —for a grant of 2000
acres per mile. Another proposal has just been
■entertained by the Government of a more liberal
nature. Mr. E. Keane, M.P., contractor for the
Midland Railway, has agreed to construct a line
of 28 miles in length, connecting a very valuable
timber area (owned by the contractor) with the
■city. He demands no concession of land, but will
allow the Government to take over the line at a
valuation at the end of seven years.
A Victorian paper anounces with an air of
pride that a Trentham farmer has five men at
work digging potatoes, whose joint ages—the
men/’ not the potatoes—amount to 348 years,
making an average of about seventy years, each.
The country editor is considerably inflated over
this circumstance, but there doesn’t seem to be
much cause for congratulation in the’ fact that the
used up Australian patriarch has to go digging in
his extreme old a£e in order to earn a miserable
pittance that will just keep him alive. If the
writer had stated that these five Individuals had
retired from business on five separate annuities
provided by a system of national insurance, and
that some younger individuals were digging
potatoes for them, there,-i would be a lot
more satisfaction in the anecdote.
A Yankee named Hurlbert (his real name
is said to Be HurKhU), editor for iriariy years of New
York World/ ripw proprietor 'of tries’ Central
News Press-Association 1 , ikin tibub'le on account
of a hkrd-'sweating female --who lately brought
against him an action in London for' brea'ch-of-
promise. The .lady states that she, met Hurlbert
(a snob who poses in London as an Englishman,
and ingratiates, himself with the old, and new
nobility by writing anti-Irish pamphlets]! in an
omnibus, whpn they loved each othpr with a deep
and sudden affection ; and thereafter fie led her
astray under promise of marriage, arid for several
months she lived with him as his friisfress. She
has a nuftiber of letters (riiostly of a hideonsly-
indecent character) in what', if riot his own hand-
writing, is utterly therefrom,
and with his signature attached ; and she can point
out the house where they lived together; and a host
of vociferous witnesses are prepared to identify
both Hurlbert and herself as the occupants of the
house; and moreover the man who took the place
used Hurlbert’s name as well as his head and face,
and his clothes, and his handwriting. On the
other hand Hurlbert makes affidavit that he
is as innocent as a new-laid egg; that he was
never in that omnibus—that he doesn’t know
the lady—and that a fiend in human shape, who
looks just like him, wrote the letters, and took
the house, and perpetrated the whole proceeding,
and that this monster is now snuggering
in his loathsome den over the ruin he
has accomplished. He asserts that this
particular reptile was formerly his secretary,
and that he and the secretary cannot be distin-
guished apart, and that the bounced employe
imitates his hand-writing better than he can do it
himself. His secretary, in fact, looks more like
Hurlbert than Hurlbert does, and it takes the
latter all his time to prevent.this infamous char-
acter seizing upon his office, and taking over
his wife and family, and his home, and his bank-
account, and firing the real owner into the street
as an impostor. If the duplicate person chose to
rush the office some morning and run the business
before Hurlbert got down, the latter is convinced
that it would be all over with him, for his un-
principled shadow would not only look like him,
but would write leading articles and sign cheques
in his hand, and swear in his voice, and wear his
clothes; and Hurlbert himself, who had owned a
valuable property a moment before, would be
cleaned out in an instant, and wouldn’t own any-
thing or be anybody. And simply by reason of
this fiendish resemblance he can’t find anybody
who ever saw the impostor, for everybody who
saw him took him for Hurlbert himself, and
therefore this harassed individual has nothing
but his own hard swearing to defend on. Even
that, too, doesn’t amount to much, for it may be
the other man who is swearing all the time, the
two swear so much alike, that even an affidavit
can’t disentangle them. Hurlbert got the verdict,
as the lady failed to prove that he had promised
her marriage; but either she or he should be
heard of shortly in connection with a first-class
perjury prosecution.

Dear Bulletin, —In the Queensland in-
terior heavy rains usually occur about the
latter end of February or March When the summer
has cooled off a bit. Sometimes, however, the
rain sets in right on top of the hottest weather.
These peculiar conditions seem to suit the sand-
flies who crop up in billions, So that for‘a week or
two nothing else is talked of, and man arid beast
suffer alike. They drive the wildest Station-
horses into the stockyard where fires are kept
burning all day long. The cattle become one
restless moaning mob vainly seeking refuge in
numbers; and even the stockmen are maddened
by the festering bite, although they show but a
few vulnerable inches of skin. It was in one of
the worst sandfly times that Augustus 'Bigg
Neucholmondeley drew up on the banks of Sandy
Creek and flapped himself smartly with a gum-
bough as he looked across the turgid surface of its
waters to the other bank’ where the track shook
itself free from the water. The current was not
swift but the creek was broad—very broad—a
hundred yards, at least, and ’Gus felt; that it was
necessary to strip in order to get over. He was
a strong swimmer and there was a good get-out on
the other side. So he dismounted, started a fire,
and under the protection of the smoke undressed.
He then tied his clothes into a ball and strapped
it on the top of his head. Then he passed
his belt through the tags of his boots and
slung them round his neck. He then drew the
old horse into the smoke, and as quickly as the
thumps of bare heels could do it urged him into
the stream. He had made a mistake. The muddy
current he had taken to be at least ten feet deep
scarcely covered his horse’s fetlocks. It was a
flat sandy bed right across, not a foot at the deep-
est part. If Augustus had had any sense he
would have gone back again into the smoke, but
he kept on thinking he would be into the deep

to meet him on the other side, thought for a

816 Macquarie-strcet North, Sydney, Jane 17,1891.
Mr Dkar MoorabisbA,—
I am told—though I scarcely believe it — that three
Sydney society girls, aided and abetted by a matron r f
the frisky Variety, hither surprised a handful of men
Whom they (in the matron’s name) invited to a theatre-
party recently, and champagne-supper’d afterwards in a
private room at a public cafC ! Of Course, a feed is the
only possible way of rounding off a theatre-party, and
When it happens at a private house nobody can find fault
with the arrangement. But for a bevy of girls (everybody
was fully aware that matron was a polite myth When the
bill came in) to " shout' 1 a midnight spread to four favoured
male friends, reads something worse than “ Uncon-
ventional,” doesn’t it ? And apropos tb such things, it i a
whispered that a “set” of rather reckless “ sassiety
girls” make the pace Very hot at times when the
chaperone is asleep. At a recent dance, for instance, one
fair daughter of a well-known Sydney ihan amused her
partner in a conservatory interval by smoking two
cigarettes at the same-time, and blowing the smoke down
her nostrils.
Still the female suffragists rage, and still the hapless
being who ventures to disagree with them is indignantly
asked—" Ought not a Woman ” (With such a big W) “to
have a word in the making of those laws which she is
expected to keep?” But the question is—Are women
supposed to keep the laws as stringently as meh, and, if
not, will they ever be expected to do so? Certainly the
punishment which one of our sex gets when she breaks one
of them (a law, not .a man), doesn t indicate that, in prac-
tice at least, Woman is on the same plane as Man. As a rule
of thumb, every female inhabitant tries not to steal her
neighbour s goods or poison him—but if she does, what
sort of retribution overtakes her? They don t(nowadays)
flog women, and, as a rule, they don't hang them, and a
barrister once told me that he has seen a pardoning gleam
in the eye of the sternest judge at the slightest evidence
of softness or “womanliness” in a female criminal.
Looked at thUsly—as favoured beings to whom only half
the law is applicable, women ought not to be enfranchised
sotely because they have no say “In the laws which they
are expected to keep,” but which they very, very seldom
feel in their full severity.
Taking them "by and large,” as sailors say, the
Women’s Rightists of Sydney are weird human produo.
tions who do not hesitate to boldly advertise their
qualities of mind and soul, Which disappear when
alluded to. Who was it said that when you began to
boast of virtue it was gone ? But the vast mob of women
who yearn to insert their finger Into the Parliamentary
pie, and who disguise what is only another phase of female
inquisitiveness under the aspect of a desire to right the
“ wrongs” of their fellow-women—are not the angels of
mercy they advertise to be. If woman, as a class, is so
jealous of her liberties, why are the majority of evening
shoppers arrayed in skirts and bonnets? Of course the
poor soul is sympathetic. “What a pity they don’t let
you go home at six !” she says comfortably to the haggard
■hop-girl as she orders down still another bale of rags at
9.30.
Lady Jersey does not seem to be an enthusiastic slip,
porter of the enfranchised female. I think it was at New-
castle that our social apex refused to express her views,
yet gave them by saying: “ There is a great deal of work
that must be done by women only. If they add to this
all the work of men, they must either do double duty,
which is not good for anyone, or neglect the tasks which
are more distinctly their own.” In other plainer words—
“ Keep on rocking the cradle and let the old man get his
coat torn off at the ballot-box,” is “ M. E. Jersey’s ” advice
to her temporary subjects. lam not disposed to quarrel
with it.
The first Jersey June “At Home” was quite a new
thrill, even for the jaded Government House haunter, for
Dutch tops and conversation were the diversions provided
to the dull thud of a concealed brass band; but as the
party had rather grown out of playing with tops the
game was voted deadly slow and chin-music had it all its
own way. The dressing was good, though there was a
preponderance of dowagers—in regard to whose perpetua l
presence at all Government House shivoos it has been
fervently wished that vice-regality would gently shelve
these withered monuments of the past and give the
coming woman a show. Lady J. (who looks best in rich
warm colours) wore ivory satin and very special diamond
and pearl ornaments; her two girls were in red pongCe
■potted white; Miss Stephen in shrimp-pink; Miss
Burdett-Smith, white bengaline trimmed with jet; Mrs-
Vanderveer-Greene in white silk, ciel-blue chiffon and
ostrich tips. There were many black gowns-the
prettiest being worn by Mrs. Chipman who combined
black and gold most effectively.
By the way, at this gay and festive whirl, great interest
"was taken in an audible fight between a well-known
Sydney man and his wife as to whether it was or wasn’t
the caper to pump-handle the hostess on taking leave—
he, being a man and merciful, contending that it Was
Superfluous while the lady (it is needless to remark that
WOn the battle) insisted on the tired farewell squeeze.
They are not the first married couple who have sulked
home over this very interesting point of etiquette, nor
will they be the last, since nearly everybody is deeply
agitated aiid bothered as to what is really the correct thing
lo db, and nobody seems to be able to give anybody a
pointer about it. But a society butterfly of the
airiest description, Who would sooner die than dogs-ear
the wrong corner of her visiting card, kindly gave me her
plan of campaign on these occasions: “If I leave early
I slip away ns quietly ns I can, but if I wait until the
break-up of the affair, I make a point of bidding my
hostess ‘good night.’” But, reverting to the connubial
divergence of opinion which amused everybody so, isn't
it rather significant of how very “ occasional ” is the
veneer of local society—two people audibly squabbling as
to what is “ manners?”
Aow that the Jerseys have led off With a'n evening
entertainment, consisting chiefly of parlour-games, it is
on the cards that their aggravating pastimes will have a
tun, and that the dancing man will hang his pumps on a
nail and cultivate a passion for hunt-the-slipper, and
the dancing girl get up an enthusiasm for “magic
fnusic” instead of the deux temps. But so long a s
society keeps strictly to “ silence and fun,” as playbills
Say, then everything will be right as rain—l only quail
when I think of those dreadful parlour pastimes which
hall for a dertain amount of mental effort. Imagine a
typical Potts Pointer lured into that lively game, “ A
ship ckme to Liverpool laden with ” A, B, C, and so on.
I can almost hear the bejewelled creature, as it comes to
S, pompously announcing that the vessel carried
“ cigars.”
Since the Melbourne suburbs have been metamorphosed
into citiek, each little suburban mayoress has commenced
“ teceiving ” in the local Town Hall with the lynx-eyed
reporter of the Suburban Snooks panting after the clothes
of the grubby little assemblage of people Who turn up at
the uSual weird refreshments in on’C corner. There is a
perfect mania among women now to stand wherever they
get the chance, on a bit of carpet between tWo groggy
pot-plants pump-handling all the rag-tag who choose to
wander in, and it is this apeing Of “ society manners ” by
little cheap Snobs that is really responsible for half the
domestic infelicity in Australia. Hitherto a 10’t of uir
affluent women haVe been content With their homes and
children, but now they travesty the pastimes and cloth"
ing ot the rich—dancing In flimsy “ satins " at vulgar
“ socials” instead of sewing at holnein home-spun. These
suburban civic “it homes” h'ow supply the finishing*
touch. I can alttiost hear a cotton-plush-clad wife of some
hard-worked Uian telling Mm as ’o\V She couldn’t cook Mm
a meat tea ’cos she got back latfe from the ’ception.
Haring the recent visit of Lord and Lady Jersey to the
Industrial Blind Institution in Williavn Strcet, Sydney, it
transpired that this deserving asylum is £C3Bindebt. The
institution gives employment tb 3l Workers Who are
taught to make basket Ware, brats, Walters, nets-but,
then, What is the use Of making things Which nobody
buys? It Would he a great help if loOal philanthropists
gave orders that all their heeds in the hasket-lihb shbhld
be purchased from the Industrial blind, whose charges are
quite moderate.
The matin6e operetta, “ Prince and Pedlar,’ 1 performed
by the Fort-street Public School childreh at Her Majesty’s
on 13th inst in the presence Of Lady Jersey, Mrs. J. H.
Carruthers, and a three-thousand attendance, had only
one item which really made the andier.Ce open its eyes,
and that was the apparition of a pale, small girl With gas-
pipe arms and legs who advanced to the footlights and
whistled very sweetly, but in rather bad time, the Waltz-
song from “ Pirates;” and in response to a thumping
encore an Arditi waltz; It was the prettiest whistling I
have ever heard, and it was amusing to see how the boy 4
on the stage and in the circle craned their necks listening
to every trill that came from her funny; putsed-up little
mouth. That is the worst cl whistling, it creases the lips
so—and probably when this little siflleuse grows up with
what is commonly'called an absolutely unkissable “pipe
mouth,” she Will be sorry she ever did it* Soule of the
Robber choruses were good, and dressing and mounting
were all right,'but everybody sang too slowly, and the
soloists' voices weren’t strong enough to fill the theatre-
I was pleased to see how awkwardly nearly all the per-
formers behaved, for anything is better than brazen
kplomb in a child, though one fat maiden with thick ankles
and a husky voice, attitudinised and sang like quite an old
hand. There were no dresses worth a glance in the d.c.
Lady jersey, presented with a beautiful cream-tinted
bonnet-bouquet, wore pale-blue woollen with panel and
trimmings of bide moire feather enhanced by bands or
jewelled trimming, small bonnet in black and canary
velvet and jet; her three daughters in biscuit silks and
big leghorn hats and feathers, and the small scion as usual
in a sailor suit. Mrs. Carruthers, who occupied a seat in
the vice-regal box, wore black, with a fetching little
bonnet in black lace and jet. Secretary Goschen looked
after the party with his mouth open, as usual.-
At an Ashfield marriage the other day the bridesmaids
came in for all the delicate little attentions usual on such
occasions through a crowd of girl friends at the church
mistaking their carriage for that of the bride. They
tied old shoes to the handle and threw rice after the
blushing damsels, who, of course, didn’t know what to do
with the showering grain. The bride and groom escaped
scot free.
After all the excitement oyer it, the real race-scene in
II County Fair,” at Her Majesty’s, though a very
thrilling spectacle, is not, in my opinion, half so interest-
ing as the comedy-drama itself, which is a complete get-
away from the virtuous heroine and the bold, had baronet
sort of play. Comedienne Sadie Stringham plays Miss
Abbey for all that amusing Yankee is worth, and her
fall downstairs at the end of the first act convulses even
the d.o. Also her “business,” as she probes with a
broom-handle for the ever-dreaded “man under the
bed,” must appeal to every old maid in the house who has
ever jumped at her own shadow after nightfall, or
calmly looked under her virtuous couch in the hope that
she would find a man there. Watts-Phillips had all the
gowning in this life-like show—her first array of King’s
crimson with neck-folds of white mull; her second dress
of dove-grey with a pale-pink sun-bonnet; her third, of
pale-pink muslin very daintily cut; and her fourth of
cream delaine trimmed with sap-green and pink reversible
satin ribbon, all looked especially fresh considering the
every-day prevalence of dingy winter clothes. By the
way, the evening I witnessed “County Fair,” pianist
Ernest Hutcheson occupied the centre box with a party
of ladies, and what pleased me with him was, that when
the house clapped the orchestra for a very pretty
rendering of some of Bellini’s music, Mister (or rather
Master—he is so young and boyish-looking) Hutcheson
also gently applauded.
Melbourne, seemingly, has not yet discovered that
La Bernhardt paints her gums, but she does, and her
little pot of gum-grease costs fifteen-and-six. Now, in
case Society wants to trump her trick, I might as well
add that you can’t get the salve in Australia—as yet—
though the great living example of Sara is sure to create
an immediate demand, since society—regarded in the
the light of a lovely fresco—does not leave out the finer
touches. Indeed, on a river-steamer recently I sat
alongside an elaborate face-artist who had actually painted
a poetic blue line—to represent a vehi—on her white-
washed temple. “A good painting,” whispered a saw-
bones friend of mine, “but she doesn’t know her
anatdmy.”
And apropos makes-up—What an artistic mistake it
is for a woman on the yellow side of forty to attempt to
restore her youthful bloom with powder and pigments !
No ruin is ever improved by giving it a coat of paint the
colour It was when it was built.
On dit that the big bouquet presented to Lady X when
she held that amusing little reception in the country the
other day, was sent by the “Ministerial spaniel ” (one
achieves such language during a general election) who
accompanied the party. That was quite as it should be,
but what wa 4 riot right waa (bat the ‘ * Holy Mother ” of the
neighbouring convent was allowed to present it with
various complinfents. As the pious lady never sees a
newspaper, she had not the slightest idea of whom she
was complimenting. It is whispered that this little bit of
a joke small as it seems—will greatly influence the R.'C.
vote.
Speaking of Improprieties, it was enough to make any
moralist shed a tear to see an emphatically divorced
Sydney actor doing the Block the morning after a more
or less detailed account of his sins had appeared in the
papers. I was glad, however, to see that he flaUnted a
big red nosegay the size of a cheese-plate. It suited him,
in a Swinburnian sense.
If the ticket-takers at Sydney Royal break down
from over-work, arid the ushers commence giving way in
the knees, nobody should be surprised, considering the
crowd§ thkt have confronted them since the staging of
“ Gondolier's’’— despite the weeping weather and the
cheap excitement of the elections. But dressing suffers
when it’s wet, and, the other evening, though the circle
was a cram, I only saw one get-up really worth peeping
at. ’Twas a yellow brocade, the ‘coldur of & 'deck’s beak,
and trimmed with a fashionable “ jewel ” tri’rn'ming in
gold and jasper; the bodice finished with yellotv crepe
and real diamonds (Which you can easily tell by noticing
whether they snap in the dark as well as the light) here
and there. This was sported by a gipsy-tinted woman)
who also wore one glove off to reveal, of course, such a
glittering ring 1
Behind the curtain the dressing was gay and fanciful,
but mostly the same for both acts. Flora Qraupner and
■pretty little Violet Varley (who Warbles now with quite
the Ida Osborne gurgle) have only ofle frorik apiece, and
the decorous Miss Young is doomed to two costumes of
peculiarly awful shape, in Which a real geiddess couldn’t
help looking like k performing lamp-shade—but the
gowns are riot the draw at “ Gondoliers.” It’s baritone
Ryley, of the lah-de-dah voice, and twinkling shanks,
tipon whom each femininU optic is hauntingly fixed, you
bet.
t wonder what local belledbffi is thinking of when from
the boxes it ogles the male histriCn aS if he Were quite a
different Sort of human product to the street dandy Who
Returns siich attentions with a wink or a whisk of his
handkerchief, and boasts of his prowess of “ taashing ’em

When I was budding in my innocence and youth I was
about as Credulous as they are made now-a-days—but
since that halcyon period I have linearthed so many
shams that hdw at the age of, well—well, look at my like,
hess at the top of this column if you want to know- I do
nothing but turn up deceptions masquerading as every-
thing but What they really are. The last whited sepulchre
that I have bumped against is the lovely legend—“ Dottie’s
trousseau comes from England- every rag of it, from the
gown to the garters.” Only the other day a pretty bride
formulated this charming lit tle tarradiddle with the most
ingenious smile in the World, and she did it so well that I
Would have believed her had I not, only that morning
escorted a friend to a small, suburban frockisfs who
proudly informed us that she had just sent home Miss
Blank’s wedding-clothes ! I suppose she told me the fib
about it because she was foolishly ashamed of the hire-
ling. Now, whenever I am told the legend of that “ trous-
seau out from Home,” I simply reflect—“ Could not afford
the big shops, and got it done round the corner.” Now,
I have heard people say?—“Sappho Smith - pooh ! she’s
not a woman.” I ask you to calmly read this paragraph
and say whether I’m a woman or not?
Another instance of the illiberality of the average
clergyman occurred at a suburban church on the day of Sir
John Robertson's funeral. In the morning the organist
asked if he might play the “Dead March” in memoriam
of Sir Jack, but the head Christian of the premises
refused, in a faint and horrified voice, to allow such a
tribute to be paid to a man who had not been in the
habit, during life, of going to church three times every
Sunday. In the evenipg, hqwever, this shining example
Upended himself in his pulpit, and announced in a tearful
voice that the “ Dead March” would be played in memory
of the - aw—late Archbishop of York. So, after all, the
organist played it, and the audience took it as a tribute
to old Jack Robertson. .
The features of a very fashionable recent afternoon
musical “ at home,” were the absence of men and chairs —
two things no properly regulated woman can hope to be
without. Fancy four men and seventy women ! Also
somebody complains of the bad behaviour of two member 3
of a generally-bad-behaved family who stood under the
centre chandelier nudgingone another as each guest filled
the doorway. But the music was excellent, even if the com-
pany had to listen to it crowding round the doors and in
the hall.
Mrs. Henry Dangar’s dance, the other evening, was
poetised by a trio of debutantes all nice and fresh-looking
but lacking “go,” as usual—their simple white clothes
making them still more school-girlifled. Really girls who
are “coming-out ” ought to object to the milk-and-water
frocking forced upon them. Even the tricky belle of two
seasons couldn’t look other than meek and mild with no
padding in her frock and her shoulders tied up with baby,
ribbon. On this occasion Mrs. J. Mitchell’s fashionable
silver tinsel brocade was the most effective dress on the
floor.
Rather a costume-wedding was that of Miss Connie
Richards, of Holkharn, Randwick, to Mr. Duncan Carson,
son of Mr. John Carson, of Glutha, Studley Park, Vic-
toria, which happened Oh 10th inst., at St. Jude’s, Rand-
wick. The tall bride wore Whfte satin brocade, orange-
blossoms, Venetian point lace and chiffon, and was backed
up by three adult maids in cream serge broidered in gold
and rather theatrical hats en suite and three mites in real
Greenaway frocks to the ankles, of cream silk and
fur. At this wedding the bride innovated somewhat’by
presenting each of her three gown-maids with a lace
handkerchief. Honeymoon in Melbourne, where the
bride journeyed in electric-blue cloth braided in gold and
blue cloth hat with astrachan crown.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

The S.M. Herald says that 'cheers were
given tor “The Qtuien ”‘after the nomination for
West Sydney. If groahs be cheers, the HERALD
speaks truly. Tire Bulletin was there, 'and a
more unanimous yell Of execration never Went tip
from seven thousand throats.
The Bulletin denounces the Australian
daily press as a political Thug—as a lying institu-
tion which politically has the morals of a common
garotter. Its malignant and cowardly kuppre.s-
sions and distortions 'of the utterances of the
labour-candidates dutfrig every general election
stamps it As the Cold-blooded assassin of that
“free speech ” which is its vaunted shibboleth.
Tree speech ! Tor What does mere oral utterance
count under the reign of that foul and meretricious
institution the “ independent ” Press, the
hireling and venal advocate of the rich and
the Corrupt gagger of the poor? What
avail mere spoken and unreported words,
whose direct force extends not beyond the range
of the human voice, against the übiquitous and
daily assaults and Suppressions of the omnipotent,
unsleeping, and far-reaching enemy Of the
democracy? Gentlemen, The Bulletin a‘ks you
to drink to the Australian Sup-Press—and to let
the Sup-Press have a place high up on the toast-
list of every democratic gathering.
The jewels belonging, to Her Gracious are
worth a trifle over £3,000,000; and the owner of
all this hidden wealth wears a seedy old crape
dress with a pocket in it like a coal-sack, and an
old, smashed bonnet that seems as if it had been
struck by ink.and lightning, and has no more use
for all these diamonds and rubies than she has for
5,000,< 00 briek-s. And meanwhile all this money
lies hidden and locked up, instead of being used
to pay for a good healthy revolution, and to
defray the expenses of a Wild stem-chase after the
House of Lords, with the peers bolting wildly in
front, and their bleeding country following close
behind with a fence-rail and a big rock to keep
them moving. Three millions ! Great Scott 1
What a breezy insurrection could be got up for
the money if it were only properly applied! It
would buy torpedoes enough to sink all the navies’
inexistence; and dynamite enough to scatter all
the royal families of the earth so effectually that
it would rain scraps of monarch for three weeks
afterwards; and liquor enough to make all the
standing armies of Europe oo tight that they
would bamboo their apoplectic generals and roll
the field-marshals and arch-dukes in the mud,
and .mutiny to the last man. And meanwhile it
does "no more good to anybody than a toad inside
a rock. •
With the sentiments set tbrth in the
following letter, which, as will be seen,
reached us two days before the polling. The
Bulletin concurs. It, however, refuses to believe
that the workmen as a class are.responsible for the
hideous display of blundering and cold-blooded
ingratitude which has unfortunately occurred in
connection with South Sydney election :
Dear Bulletin, —Are the tactics of the N.S.W. .Labour
party generally commendable as regards their attitude to
the Protectionist party ? Have they not wantonly and
needlessly and’illogically hampered them almost at every
turn in fighting the Parkes Government— purely an Em-
ployers’ Government—at the present crisis ?- stubbornly
refusing all overtures from .the rProtectionists, refusing to
pair with their candidates when it would have been in
the mutual interest to do so, and, above all, contesting
seats of late members who, in times of trouble, .when the
grit of public men was tested in the presence of the world,
manfully assisted them by every means in their power ?
Look at South Sydney. Was it fair to oppose
Traill, Edmunds, and Toohey, the only representatives
of- any city constituency who 'openly stood by the
workers ; members as democratic in spirit and .action
as the representatives of Northumberland in the N.S.W.
and more democratic than those of Collingwood in the
Victorian Assembly? Then, not content with bitterly
opposing these.three men, two at least of whom are so
able that they would cutmore than.respectable figures iu
any deliberative assembly, they' issue against them
grossly unfair leaflets and also workup a farcical bribery
charge against them—because the alleged “labour”
candidates, who at the present juncture look very like
unconscious, simple-minded tools of the Employers’
Union, are offered their expenses (that is what the
“ bribe ” amounts to) to retire from a contest in which
the workman is biting his brother’s nose off. At the
public meeting last Thursday, at New Masonic Hall, it
was agreed that Messrs. Higgs and Flowers should be
asked to retire. To make such a request without offering
to pay expenses incurred would have been unfair ; that
anything more was offered no one really believes.
In any case, Labour is helping Labour’s bitterest enemies
—the .men for whom the solid vote-of Property and the
Employers’ Union will go. Fancy throwing .over Traill
for Wise—that’s what may happen, and I ask, considering
the public history of these twomen, whether the exchange,,
if effected, will be one full of promise for the workers?
In view of past events, .the apparent determination erf
Labour to elect bona-fide proletarian working-men only
in all cases, is open to objection, and, as in the case of
South Sydney, means division and, perhaps, disaster—the
Eossible loss of the services of, good and tried friends of
abour. Grey, utterer of the loudest trumpet-call yet made
to Labour in this part of the world, is a born aristo-
crat—and supposing he represented South Sydney now,
would the workers try to turn him out in favour of the
unproved Higgs and Flowers, who may be either gods or
asses, and about whom the world knows, nothing, except
that they are practically cutting the throats of, the class
to which they belong ? Even Grey himself could not have
much more democratically represented South Sydney
than the present members. I feel strongly on this because
I am myself a workman, and heart and soul with the work-
men, although, to be honest, I am not a wage-earner.—

A Turkish Bath.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Tr , . . . .
Ajwasa slack time at a Melbourne Turkish bath,
n ,P ,°®. was that day for ladies,
and the ladies seemed slow to turn up, and the
attendant was pensively eating the top of her
pencil and thinking of nothing at all. By-and-
by° s he began to grow drowsy and in another
minute she would have fallen asleep, only a
shadow passed unexpectedly between her and the
Hunhght, and she sat up again. It was a large
shadow, and was cast by a big, sunburnt female
who was nervously standing off and on in the
doorway, and showing signals of distress. Ap-
patently she wanted to come in, and at the same
tune she wanted to stay out, and by
way of striking an average between these two
emotions she was coming in backwards, and
instead ot coming in a straight line she was rub-
bing herself along the wall. Her age was pro-
bably about 18, and she was a stout, gawky
person, evidently fresh from some untrodden
region m the bush. When she had traversed most
of the corridor she concussed against an umbrella-
stand, and would have fallen over it and landed
in great disorder on the floor, but the attendant
rushed out and caught her, and then she acknow-
ledged nervously and apologetically that she had
come to try a Turkish bath and see what it was
.
She seemed so miserably scared by her own
rashness that the bath-woman took pity on her,
and told her that her resolution was in every way
commendable. I hen she led the patient up to
the orace and waited for her to pay the accustomed
contribution. But the sufferer plainly had no
idea of what was expected of her, and tacked
back aud forward in front of the pigeon-hole, and
started to supply a brief resume of her history,
together with a quantity of interesting informa-
tion concerning her parents, and various details
regarding outside branches of the family. As she
went on it gradually dawned on the surprised
attendant that her visitor was endeavouring to
explain away the suspicious circumstance of her
wanting a bath—she wanted to show, in fact,
JOHN BURNS IN THE WORKSHOP.
[FROM A PHOTO. BY “DUSA."]
that the bath was forced upon her by circum-
stances which were too strong to be resisted—
that her whole life had led up to that bath, and
any reflections which the bath might leave upon
her character were therefore wholly undeserved.
I hen she interrupted her.
“ It’ll be three shillings, please. ”
kem out from Hingland when eleven years
of age,” pursued the customer in an agony of
nervousness, “along with the rest of the family,
two of them havin’ since died, and lived in the
country ever since down Gippsland way in aquiet,
though respectable, locality— ”
“If you’!! kindly go along with the attendant
she il show you the way.”
The attendant, in fact, was grasping her from
behind and endeavouring to conduct her along the
passage, but she was hard to move. She was
heavy, for one thing; and for another she was so
deeply involved in her efforts to clear her
character that she was quite unconscious that
anybody was shoving her. But at last she got
into sudden motion and was led in the saloon and
almost to the door of one of the little apartments
where the victim is supposed to leave her
eyery-day attire. Then she somehow backed the
distracted official against the wall, and over-
whelmed her with an observation that lasted
nearly a quarter of an hour, and covered her with
a waste of battered grammar and putrified syntax
and old disused pronunciation. At the end of
that _ time her auditor managed to shove
her into a room, containing a looking-glass,
a chair, and a bathing costume, and left her
there. After that she went out and had
hysterics in the passage, and another female had
to take her place for the rest of the day.
About three hours afterwards the lady in the
office, dropped in to make some inquiries, and by
comparing notes with the new attendant it was
discovered that a customer had got lost somewhere
on the premises. -There was a hurried investiga-
tion, and the strayed individual was found sitting
down in room No. 10. She was in an exhausted
state from want or provisions, but was sticking
manfully to her post. The leader of the search-
party went back to the office, and laughed till her
back-hair flew off, but the other rose to the
occasion. She had once been a nurse in a female
lunatic asylum, and concluding that the visitor
was a convalescent who had been ordered a
Turkish bath for the good of her intelligence, she
proceeded to undress her by force and induct her
into the bathing costume. Then she went out in
quest of a towel or something, and found the door
locked on her return, and when she hailed the
customer through the keyhole, and explained that
she was expected to come out in her scanty attire,
that inmate braced herself firmly against the door
and yelled “Thieves.” Two elderly ladies, attired
in a long white sheet apiece, who were “ cool-
ing off ” after going through the customary
process, dropped their hot coffee over each other
in terror at this sudden outbreak, and let go their
back-hair, and the magazines they were reading,
and fled in a scalded state for the door.
There was a hurried consultation of the entire
establishment, and then another attendant—the
one whose business it was to soap the visitors and
throw the hot water over them —came and nego-
tiated through the keyhole. The lady inside was
still holding the door with all her might, and had
her head braced against it and her feet against
the wall. She wanted to have her Turkish bath
inside all by herself and stated that she was born
of poor but respectable parents. Being told that
this was impossible, she refused to emerge on any
terms, and cast such reflections upon the person
outside that the latter climbed up on a chair
with a view to dragging the bather out over the
top of the partition. She came down again hur-
riedly and went away to put some cooling sub-
stance on her eye, and there was a long pause, till
a motherly old lady, who had been having a bath
to cure her rheumatism, borrowed a kitchen-table
and mounting it with difficulty, proceeded to look
over the door and remonstrate with the erring
fellow-creature on the other side. The messenger
of peace wore a large towel and a pair of spec-
tacles, and she had her hair cut short, which pos-
Si bly created a misconception on the other side,
or when the distracted girl saw her head appear
she gave a wild howl and called out “Fire!” She
said it so aggressively, too, that there was a hur-
lit u y attendants under the iiiipression
that the caged maniac was jumping at the lady on
the table and trying to seize her by the throat.
-But the tumult calmed down after this, and oil
was presently thrown upon the troubled customer
inside, ihe old lady pointed out that it was im-
possible to pass a tub of water and some soap over
the partition and that a bath, taken under such
circumstances, was cold and uncomfortable, and
moreover, it wasn’t a Turkish bath at all. Then
she assured her that ladies of the highest respecta-
bility did come out with nothing on but a bathing
costume ; and finally she gained the confidence of
her auditor, and induced her to explain the situa-
tion. It appeared that she had been reading a
romance with the beginning and the end torn out,
and a large section gone out of the centre; but in
the remains of this work it had transpired that
the heroine—whose name was Gwendoline-had a
lurlash bath on one occasion, and this fact had
led her to rush miserably into her present alarm-
ing situation. Then she broke down hopelessly
and stated .that the very thing she wanted now
was to get her clothes on and go home to her
mother, but she couldn’t get her clothes on because
she was holding the door with both hands, and if
she let go the door she was afraid the people out-
side would rush in, and carry her away to be
washed in some outlandish fashion that might
prove fatal. She added that she had been sitting
there on a chair for eight hours, and hanging on
to the door-handle for a century, and that a
strange woman had burst in and torn most of her
clothes off, and wrapped a sheet round her, and
she wished she was dead.
By this time the attendant with the damaged
eye had come back with an axe, and was hanging
round in the hope that she might have a chance to
break in the door and haul out her assailant by
violence. But she sat down in astonishment
find dropped her weapon heavily on the floor when
she saw the door open of its own accord, and the
old lady scramble down off the. table, and go in,
and embrace the rampant patient. And she was
still more surprised when the patient returned the
embrace, and buried her head in her friend’s
capacious bosom, and stated tearfully tliat she
was hungry. And finally, when the peacemaker
undertook to go and have another bath, merely in
order that she might see the forlorn stranger
safely through the ordeal, and the latter consented
to this arrangement, she went off and opened the
door quietly, and threw the axe out into the
passage. Then the old lady, in her towel and blue
spectacles, and with a kindly smile bn her coun-
tenance, stalked proudly into the “hot room,”
and her tame captive trotted after her undressed
and in her right mind.
Still the guardian angel came very near swear-
ing when shb turned round and found that her
follower was carrying all her clothes along with
her. She had her boots slung round her neck,
and a bonnet and a stocking in one hand, and the
second stocking and a whole assortment of mis-
cellaneous articles in the other, and her other
things were mostly carried in her teeth. And
when she was urgently requested to leave her
clothes in the dressing-room she responded with
the unanswerable conundrum: “Supposin’ they
was to be took ?”
“ But they won’t be taken, my child. Nobody
will touch them. ”
“But if they tvas to be took, I couldn’t get
home like this.”
This was undeniable, but the old lady settled
the matter by taking firm hold of the whole con-
signment of clothes and carrying them out. When
she opened the door in coming back she concussed
it heavily against the head of her protege, who was
following her movements through the keyhole.
That miserable sufferer had been seized with an
instantaneous conviction that her supposed friend
had absconded with the wearing apparel, and that
she was left behind—a lost girl in a bathing cos-
tume adrift on the hard surface of a strange land.
She was beginning to puff heavily in the heated
atmosphere, but still she looked unspeakably
relieved when she found that her suspicions were
baseless. After that she endured in silence for
about five minutes awful perspiration, and at
the end of that period began to pray for air.
guardian led her over to the fountain and
told her to stoop down.
She stooped.
Then the old lady emptied about a quart of cold
water over her head, and asked her if she felt
better.
The girl returned with surprising suddenness to
an erect position and answered with a glare. She
made no reply in words, but her eye expressed
the indignation of a female who had lost all faith
in the human race. It said, as plainly as a whole
dictionary of vituperation, that she had trusted
this perfidious old woman, and the old woman
had betrayed her and surreptitiously thrown cold
water on her head. It stated, as distinctly as
could state, that all was over between
them. It was the sort of look that Ctesar might
have worn if he had found himself unexpectedly
washed by Brutus in the Forum—the look that
Cato might have assumed if the whole Roman
republic had been treacherously shampooed by an
enemy in his absence. Then she solemnly walked
back to the dressing-room and proceeded to get
into her clothes with all possible haste, and fly
from that scene of baseness and deception. And
when the old lady, in a spirit of Christian for-
bearance, appealed to her through the crack to
come out with her and have some refreshment
she only banged indignantly on the other side of
the door with her boots, but other response there
was none. The proud spirit of the daughter of
the wilderness was wounded beyond all repair.

Who Shall Show Us any Good?
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Brother-worker, weather-beaten, weary-worn with
grinding labour,
Plodding on, ass-like, contented, with the world
upon your back ;
Sourly solaced that you really fare no harder than
your neighbour ;
Grimly happy when possessing comforts that
your fellows lack;
Self-abasing in the presence of a proudling ; little
thinking ,
That among the social orders you're a member
of the chief,
For With all their class distinctions; "tis a truth
will bear no blinking :
He who is not of the workers is a beggar or a
thief.
Never seek you greater guerdon than to live and
bear your burden ?
Slave too base to feel your fetters, would you
fancy you are free ?
Does the hard fact ne'er concern you, while you
lick the feet that spurn you,
That the drones do thrive and fatten on the
produce of the bee?
What to you are all the triumphs, all the glorious
gains of science ?
You, “the heir of all the ages, 55 what does
birthright mean for you ?
While the parrot-cry of “Progress 55 you repeat
with blind compliance,
Still the hard-got fruits of labour are the plunder
of the few.
Who shall show us any good? You grave and
venerable sages—•
Doctors of a musty learning, by the world
accounted wise—
While you sit amid the twilight pouring over
faded pages,
Find you not the breaking dawn too dazzling
for your owlish eyes ?
Shall we look to you for leading in the Day of Fate
approaching ?
You who waste your whole lives pondering over
riddles of the past !
Though the world of men is ever some new mine
of knowledge broaching,
Each successive age evolves a sphinx niore subtle
than the last.
Who shall show us any good ? You clever men Of
words and phrases
Weaving flimsy threads of thought into fantastic
filigree !
All your conjuring with letters merely mystifies
and dazes.
We are weary of your babble and your verbal
jugglery.
Is Hot all the great world humming with the stir
of waking nations?
Whs there ever theme more fit to set the singer's
soul aflame ?
Truly he who gives a voice, to man's most noble
aspirations
Best fulfils the poet's part and takes the royal
road to fame.
Shall we look to you for good, you smug and
shallow-hearted preacher ?
You, whose sermons lead to notlfing or some far-
fetched meaning fit
On to words of truth once spoken by the ages'
truest Teacher,
Lest they vex the ear of Dives, at whose board
you love to sit.
Can you look with cool complaisance on a world
of wealth and hunger,
Deeming it divinely ordered to continue
through all time?
“Poor ye always have among you.” Go, blas-
pheming sennon-m nger,
Tis the Christ you're crucifying; go, your cant
is foulest crime.
Statesman, you with brains so weighty, often over-
racked and heated,
Solving problems all too simple to be subtly
understood;
Impotent to cope with evils in a rotten system
seated,
You would blindly set them down as needful
for the common good ;
Holding him who serves the masses guilty of the
grossest treason ;
Ever sacredly regarding vested rights built up
on wrong;
Reared on scaly usage scarcely savoured with the
salt of reason ;
Hidebound stag, your place is wanted; you have
blocked our path too long.
Who shall show us any good ? Peace ! Hear you
not the solemn presage ?
Hear you not a voice prophetic crying in the
wilderness ?
Lo! 'tis he, the great forerunner bearing unto man
the message
To prepare the way of him who comes to bring
the world redress.
Be of courage, then, O brother, striving for the
life ideal ;
Dare assert your manhood's right though cravens
croak and cynics sneer,
What to-day is called a dream shall soon become
a thing that’s real,
And the days of dearth shall pass and then
shall come the Golden Year.
TOM FREEMAN.
27 Ross-street, Richmond, Vic.
Dear Bulletin, —Her Gracious is still
“ very much grieved when an accident happens in
amine.” The other day a miner was killed at
Ballarat (Vic.), and Hopetoun, as her Gracious 5
deputy, was all broken Tip with compassion.
Therefore he telegraphed to the Mayor, and —to
quote the eloquent words of the local paper—
“the mayor called on Mrs. Walters, who is in
very poor circumstances, and conveyed to her the
sympathy of the Governor. 55 Sympathy of that
kind ought to be suppressed by Act of Parlia-
ment. When a family has lost its breadwinner
and is left lonely and destitute, it is an outrage
on all good taste for a complete stranger to tramp
in merely to mention that Hopetoun is feeling
sorry, and then tramp out again, and Hopetoun 5 s
grief isn 5 t a large enough substance to justify the
intrusion. Moreover, Hopetoun isn't grieved,
except in his official capacity. There isn't room
for more than a pint of grief in any average man,
and a Governor can 5 t hold more woe than other
people ; and when he comes to a strange country,
and proceeds to slop over with a whole quart of
sympathy whenever a man he never saw falls
down a shaft, the sentiment is too copious to be
real. If a Governor is so badly hurt about the
death of a complete stranger, he must have felt
dreadful about the innards when he was at home
and his own personal acquaintances took to
dying ; in fact, to judge by his present condition,
it seems reasonable to suppose that he would
have been so badly broken up that he couldn't
get out to Australia at all, and yet the average
Gov. arrives in good condition, and looking quite
cheerful. Further, I have personally inspected a
Governor less than an hour after he had tele-
graphed a whole cargo of unmitigated woe about
a big railway-accident, and he seemed absolutely
jovial; and I have inspected the same Governor
at a banquet, and watched the haggard expression
in his dejected eye as he got up and stated that it
gave him the greatest pleasure to be present; and
I have come to the conclusion that the conven-
tional viceroy enjoys his grief, and feels darned
miserable over his happiness. Under these cir-
cumstances it would be a great deal more accurate
if the imported Governor sent a £2O note and left
the grief out altogether; if he must send some-
thing it might as well be something that would
look more probable than the thing he has sent
hitherto.—Yours, as usual, Titus Salt.

SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large—from 100 up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,

is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied •with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas arc
now nearly finished on (Ins estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACK-HEATH during the past three

Various Verses.
The Sheoak's Song.
In merry golden days of youth;
Do I remember well,
t wandered by a, mountain creek,
Where dancing waters fell.
There stood a row of sheoaks there,
. And picturesque were they,
And, in their shade, a maiden fair,' 5 !
With whom I talked one day ;
While, from the hill above our heads,
, The lyre-bird’s call we heard,
And watched the yellow waters flow,
By busy diggers stirred.
Far up the vale, we saw tjieir tents
Gleam white amid the trees,
And heard the stroke of pick or axe,
Upon the wandering breeze ;
hut through it all, and o’er it all,
With sway, and sigh, and swell,
The murmur in the sheoak trees,
Like music, rose and fell.
She raised her hand and"said to m
, “ Hark to the branches’ song,
And mark the tone of sorrow now
That breathes the leaves among;
As if some gentle forest sprite
Roamed from the woods apart,
And heard a tale of lonely grief
From some poor broken heart,
And brought it here and told it o
The solemn bush around,
To show them of the misery
In hunian dwellings found.”
I laughed, and said, “ No tores t fay
Wears such woeladen wings;
’Tis but a soothing lullaby
Old Mother Nature sings ;
Only a lazy song she has,
To croon a man to rest,
To lie upon this grassy bank,
And sleep upon her breast,
besides, a tale ot woe, 1 fear,
Would here unheeded fall,
When, all too oft, the human ear
Is deaf to' pity’s call.”
< i . . • • >
I stand again beside the creek,
And hear the wild birds trill,
And see the long grass waving brown,
Along the sifnny hill
But the sheoaks’ line is broken,
The axe has laid them prone,
The creek runs crystal o’er its sands.
The diggers’ tents are gone ;
And I am old, and altered, too,
While She, who spoke that day,
lies low within a grassy grave,
A hundred miles away.
But o’er my head, one sheoak stands,
And murmurs, soft and low,
The same old, endless, changing song
It sang so long ago
But, ah, its voice has changed since then*,
The lone and whispering tree
Tells now of peace and rest for her
And sadness unto me ;
But soon, oh soon, old Mother Earth
Shall take me to her breast;
And kindly Death shall come, and turn'
My sorrow into rest. '•
GEO. S. COOK.
Durante Vita.
Life to all youth is golden and red,.
And radiant with richness of light;,
Naught is known of the storm-clouds ahead,
Nor the gladness of life that is withered and dead,,
For all is so fair to the sight.
The blood-writ sorrows are never known,.
Nor wearying efforts, nor tears,
N.or endless hope, nor the dying moan.
Nor the living forsaken pining alone, ,
That pace with the gathering years.
The future betrays not the sorrows hid
In its mirage distant, unreal,
Still mankind ever will revel amid—
The children alike as their fathers did—
The myst’ries it may reveal.
But in that future, silent and stern,
Of which Time carries the key,
Youth sees naught but the pleasures that burn,,
Only the sheen of the dazzling morn -
Aflame on a silvery sea.
The glad wind rushes and dallies along
With a perfume rare on its breath,
And nothing wearies and naught is wrong,,
And joy is the burden of every song,
Though tire songs are sad as death..
Bp, age is here, and but dimly seen.
Are the glories passed away,
Glory of youth and of sunset sheen—
Darkness and death where light had been,
How cheerless and still and grey !
Ah me, but the fairest lives will drift
To a saddened sombre shore !
Sooner or later the veil will lift,
And we with our gladness and tears will shift;
And why should we wish for more ?

Vindication.
They told me lies who said your eyes
(That gleam with love whene’er I woo thee) ,
Are false, as thou art fair, my love,
’Tis only true of one, my beauty.
They said you were a hollow sham,
A hollow sham,, less saint than sinner ;:
The cowards lied, my bonnie lamb,
’Twas false —at least just after dinner.
You’d flirted oft, they said, with men ;
The lie was just a truth inverted,
And thus I turn it back again—
’Tis many men with you have flirted.,
Ah, love, my love, heed not their jeers,
No matter though the whole world flout thee,
In spite of all their scoffs and sneers
I never can think worse about thee.

♦ COPVR I OHTs'
In the Droving Days.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Only a pound ! ” said the auctioneer,
“ Only a pomid ! And I’m standing here
Selling this animal, gain or loss,
Only a pound for the drover’s horse !
Oile of the sort that was ne’er afraid;
One of the Boys df the Old Brigade,
Thoroughly honest and game, I’ll swear;
Only a little the worse for wear—
Plenty as bad to be seen in towil,
Give me a bid and I’ll knock him down !
Sdld as he stands ! And without recour.:o !
Give nie a bid for the drover’s horse ! ”
Loitering there irt an aimless way
I cast one look at the poor old gray ;
Weary and battered and screwed, of cour.rc;
But when I sighted the old gray horse,
The rough bush saddle, and single rein
Of the bridle laid on his tangled mane;
Somehow the crowd and the auctioneer
Seemed on a sudden to disappear—
Melted away in a kind of haze,
For my heart went back tp the droving days,
And in my dreaming I crossed again
The miles and miles of the saltbush plain,
The shining plain that is said to be
The dried-up bed of an inland sea,
Where the air so dry and so clear and bright
Refracts the sun with a wondrous light,
And out on the dim horizon makes
The deep, blue gleam of tire phantom lakes.
At the dawn of day we would feel the breeze
As it stirred the boughs of the sleeping trees,
And brought a breath of the fragrance rare
That comes and goes in that scented air,
For trees and grass and shrubs contain
A dry, sweet scent on the saltbush plain.
For those that know it and understand
The saltbush plain is a wonder land,
A wondrous country where Nature’s ways
Were revealed to rpe in the droving days.
Ah me ! how quickly they crowded back,
The mem’ries old of the drover’s track.
We heard the chime that the bell-birds ring,
And the glorious song that the magpies sing.
At mid-day camps in the sultry noon
We would watch the swans in the still lagoon,
Or through the clearings we saw by chance
The wild companion’s stately dance.
We watch’d the fleet wild horses pass,
And the kangaroos through the Mitchell grass ;
The emu ran with her frightened brood—
All unmolested and unpursued.
But there rose a shout and a wild hubbub
When the dingo raced for his native scrub,
And he paid right dear for his stolen meals,
With the drover’s dogs at his wretched heels ;
For we ran him down at a rattling pace ;
The pack-horse joined in the stirring chase,
And a wild halloo at the death we'd raise
We were light of heart in the droving days.
’Twas a drover’s horse ! And my hand again
Made a move to close on a fancied rein ;
For I felt the swing and the easy stride
Of a grand old horse that I used to ride.
In drought or plenty, in good or ill,
That same old steed was my comrade still ;
We worked together at dawn of light,
And camped together at fall of night :
For the old gray horse with his honest ways
Was a mate to me in the droving days.
Many a time when the nights were damp,
And the cattle rushed from the sleeping-camp
In the Mulga scrub and across the plain,
With my head bent down on his waving mane.
Through the boughs above and the stumps
below,
In the darkest night I could let him go.
At a racing speed he would choose his course,
And my life was safe with the old gray horse ;
And never a once would he cry a crack
Till he caught the cattle and wheeled them
back.
But man and horse had a fav’rite job
When an outlaw broke from a station mob ;
With a right good will was the stockwhip plied
As the old horse raced at the straggler’s side,
And the green-hide thong such a weal would
raise
We could use the whip in the droving days.
Only a pound ! And was this the end ?
Only a pound for the drover’s friend,
The drover’s friend that had seen his day
And now was worthless and cast away,
With a broken knee, and a broken heart
To be flogged and starved in a hawker’s cart!
Well, I made a bid from a sense of shame,
And the memories sake of the good old game.
“ Thank you ! Guinea ! And cheap at that !
Against you there in the curly hat !
Only a guinea ! and one more chance,
Down he goes if there’s no advance.
Third and the last time, one ! two ! three ! ”
And the old gray horse was knocked down to
me.
And now he’s wandering fat and sleek
On the lucerne flats by the homestead creek :
I dare not mount him for fear he’d fall,
But he does a journey to beat them all ;
For though he scarcely a trot can raise
He can take me back to the droving days.

Melbourne people express some sympathy
for Mr. M. J. Jones, one of the ex-committee of
the Premier Building Association, who stands
practically alone in defending a suit for the
recovery of £'(5003 deposited with the society at a
time when the limit of its loan and deposit re-
ceipts had, as the plaintiff alleges, been already
exceeded. Mr. Jones turned up his billet on the
committee after a very brief experience of the
general rottenness of things, and was not included
in the famous conspiracy charge. In the present
case he comes in amongst a group of seven defend-
ants, but as the other six are either luxuriating in
Europe, or hanging on to their shattered fortunes
with nothing ranch to lose, *' the action is mainly
directed against J ones. ” He seems to be regarded
as the only available person worth going for, and

(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,’*
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.

System.

Im peri al Fed era t ion.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
and uas become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the,countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
hav e unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the. fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, aeainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must-indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact —
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

thousands of sufferers to be a positive Remedy for
nearly all the ailments mankind is heir to. The effi-

icals in the amalgamated metals'in motion, generating
a constant but gentle flow of Electricity which passes
from the Battery into the system, purifying the Blood,
Strengthening the Nerves,ißrain and Muscles, infusing
fresh vigor into the Debilitated Constitution, Stimu-
lating the Vital Organs to their proper action and en-
abling nature to throw off numerous diseases.
The Battery will cure the following ailments :
Headache, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Neuralgia, Dicers,
and Tumors, Nervous Debility, Impotence, Liver Com-
plaints, Pever and Ague, Disease of the Kidneys and
Urinal Organs, Bronchitus, Asthma, Diphtheria, Pits,
Constipation, Piles. Heart Disease, Paralysis, Disease
of the Lungs and Throat, Skin Disorders, and almost
every form of Aches and Pains.

SWORN CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kuqblmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but 1 became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months 1 was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
