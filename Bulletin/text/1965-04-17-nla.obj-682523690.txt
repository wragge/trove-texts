National Notebook
Something New in Idiocy
may have deplored those silly
toy dogs and tigers gazing out of the
rear windows of cars and wondered
what sort of idiots would have bothered
with that sort of thing. Now you can
wonder what sort of idiot would have
a toy dog whose eyes light up every
time you touch the brake.
Canberra Makes a Splash
may have gathered from the
invitations that this was to be a
launching with a bottle of champagne,
and so on,” the Minister for the Interior,
Mr Doug Anthony, said. “But I can
assure you there will be no great splash
with this book.”
He was addressing a smiling group of
180 Canberra VIPs and Embassy folk
at a cocktail party in the National Capital
Development Commission’s exhibition
centre at Regatta Point to “launch”
Angus & Robertson’s 130-page prestige
publication, “The Future Canberra”.
The ceremony was single-mindedly
directed towards ensuring that the first
print run 4000 copies of the book
will be a sell-out. Mr Anthony was
doing his best. He pointed out that
guests would not get a free copy, that
the book was available at the bookstalls
for £2 2s. a copy and few were being
given away free. “The Prime Minister
has one and I am trying to get another,”
he said.
A & R representatives at the cere-
mony must have frozen inwardly when
the “no great splash” clanger fell from
Ministerial lips. But, after all, Mr
Anthony was right. The book was a
re-presentation of a report under the
same title tabled in the House of Rep-
resentatives on October 14 last year.
The text is longer, the frontispiece has
moved to the jacket of the book, now in
hard covers, there are many more photo-
graphs, sketches and colored maps, but
the basic story is still how Canberra is
to achieve its remarkable growth from
80.000 to 250.000 in the next 20 years.
3he story was far from ignored last
October one newspaper serialised a
condensation of “The Future Canberra”.
It is undeniably a fascinating story with
a busy cast of planners and builders, and
one that will further step up tourism in
the national capital. (Last year there
were 500,000 visitors to the city.)
Mr George Ferguson, A & R’s
managing director, touched on a funda-
mental problem of Government depart-
ments—how to make any commercial
impact with a worthwhile Government
publication—when he said: “This book
is an example of a kind of co-operative
publishing which I hope we will see a
good deal more of in the future —to
the co-operation of a Government de-
partment or instrumentality and a pub-
lishing house. Together they can do
something that neither could achieve
separately.”
In this case the NCDC was the author,
and with its raw material A & R pro-
duced what Mr Ferguson justly called
“a good example of Australian book
making”.
But what happens to many other pub-
lications from the presses of the Govern-
ment Printer? Even the most potentially
saleable are rarely offered to the pub-
lishing houses or are not considered
worth their risk capital.
A Joint Select Committee, headed by
Mr Dudley Erwin (Liberal, Vic.), pre-
sented its answer to the Federal Govern-
ment in May last year a Central
Government Publishing Office to under-
take the publishing function of depart-
ments, not just as an offshoot of the
Printing Office but properly equipped
and staffed to fill the role of publisher.
This means estimating the potential
market and using all the techniques of
the commercial publisher in production,
promotion and distribution.
A Canadian Royal Commission in
1962 said: “Departmental authors have
varied talents but not necessarily those
of a publisher.”
One “talent”, conservatism, frequently
leads to supplies of a major Govern-
ment report running out overnight, much
to the surprise of departmental officials,
in the face of a demand that was pre-
dictable.
The Government annually produces
2000 reports, booklets, pamphlets, maps
and other documents at a cost of more
than £4,000,000. The Joint Select Com-
mittee pointed out that though they
range vastly in importance they are of
interest and value to all sections of the
community—to the research worker as
well as to the casual reader.
The Government soon will have to
decide on the Committee’s main recom-
mendation, that a Government Publish-
ing Office be established.
If and when it decides in favor of the
idea, Mr Anthony may get an oppor-
tunity to make a splash with real
champagne.

Indeed, for weeks now the rumor was
going about the hotel trade that Vic-

next July.
Some hotel-keepers looked upon it
with misgivings, others could hardly
wait. In the could-hardly-wait bracket
were the three Dennis brothers, Reg,
Frank and Jack. Among many other
things they have the Tower Hotel in
Burwood Road, Hawthorn. This is a
sort of last oasis before one hits the
immense dry area of Camberwell. Hence
it makes much money.
The Dennis brothers were so confi-
dent that all was set for the new era
that Frank went on a special fact-finding
excursion to Sydney. He took with him
his architect, his catering chief, an all-
round team of specialists. They visited
36 Sydney hotels in four days. “It
nearly killed us,” he said. Upon his
return he threw a special private party
for his friends plus Press, radio and TV
just to show what life would be like
under 10 o'clock closing.
Steaks, chicken legs and such were
on until 10 p.m. closing time. There
was a small orchestra plus what Frank

Dennis called a “special spot” from 8.30
p.m. to 9.15 p.m. to attract the big
custom. Performing in the spot was a
noisy group called “The Group”.
Everybody enjoyed the evening im-
mensely.
Alas, the Dennis brothers reckoned
without the Victorian Country Party. At
their annual conference at Lome a few
days later, members voted almost solidly
for their old policy—no change in
liquor hours without a referendum. What
the Country Party doesn’t want in Vic-
toria inevitably doesn’t happen. The
Dennis brothers may have to wait quite
some time yet.
The Night That Was
of the new Sydney television
station, Channel 10, at North Ryde
last week was a night to remember . . .
but perhaps not for the station's manager
of news and current affairs," Bill Hud-
son, who was probably behind the scenes
quietly, and slowly, pulling his hair out.
After a very lively programme fea-
turing more than 200 local artists, Barry
Spicer began reading the news. He
announced a film segment on stretcher-
bearers in Vietnam. Instead, appeared
shots of water carts in local drought
areas. Carrying on without flinching,
Spicer announced a film on some re-
volutionary new steering wheel. Nothing
happened.
“Now is a film of the latest Paris
fashions,” he said. Again nothing. Said
Spicer: “Apparently that film is not
available either.”
Hudson, a former ABC man, war cor-
respondent in Korea and Reuter’s re-
porter in Singapore, regarded this “as
just one of those things that happen in
television”. “In fact,” he said, “it re-'
minds me of the time when a Melbourne
station, on its opening night, played ‘God
Save the Queen’ backwards.”
We talked to the station’s manager for
public relations, Mr A. G. Wincer, a
former executive director of the Austra-
lian Outward Bound Memorial Founda-
tion, in his palatial office in the even
more palatial station building. “We’re
really independent, you know. The
major sponsors hold only 52 per cent
of the shares—the Bank of NSW, AWA,
Email, NRMA and J. C. Williamson.
When the licence was granted, the NBC
of America bought 5 per cent of the
shares. The rest of the shares are held
by nearly 9000 shareholders.”
Originality
A s successful as the delegates may
have found Australia's first Inter-
national Design Conference (actually a
purely national gathering addressed by
two Americans and one Australian), little
of any value trickled through to the
Press. Mr Richard Latham, partner in
one of the United States’ best-known
design offices, managed to crack a few
odd pars by describing a Qantas jet as
“a tomato-juice can”, an Ansett one as a
“pinball machine” and by calling our
revered Holden “a mish-mash of all the
worst aspects of American car design”.
As far as the world outside was con-
cerned he did not get down to funda-
mentals and was neither creatively in-
tuitive nor deeply analytical, as a bro-
chure on the conference intimated he
would be.
Fortunately, the apparent lack of
newsworthiness did not affect the main
object of the get-together. This was to
provoke new . thought, have a critical
look at the situation at home and to learn
the latest ideas from overseas. No doubt,
the formidable titles of most of the
lectures had much to do with keeping
the daily Press away. Two were “Aspects
of Psychological and Sociological Prin-
ciples Critical for Visual Communica-
tion”, by Professor L. N. Haynes, head
of the Department of Industrial Arts at
the University of NSW, and “Culture
and Esthetics in a Cybernetic Society”,
by Mr Latham. The second American
was Mr Ralph Eckerstrom, now in busi-
ness on his own account after spending
eight years as the director for design,
advertising and public relations for the
Container Corporation of America.
The Americans were quick to question
the prominent but only slowly declining
preference which Australian industry dis-
plays for foreign product designs,
rather than taking the trouble to deve-
lop its own. Mr Latham believes we
have a unique personality which we do
not make the most of—“lf you want
to compete on overseas markets, you
have to dress up your products so they
look distinctively Australian, not bad
copies of somebody else’s”.
Developing this point further with
The Bulletin after the conference,
vice-chairman Mr Colin Barrie, director
of the Industrial Design Council of Aus-
tralia, said the situation was a ridiculous
one in view of the drive for exports.
“What is the use of waving the export
flag as long as industry continues to
acquire the manufacturing rights to pro-
ducts which are already on the market
overseas? It’s all very well if production
is only for the home market but this is a
very short-term approach to adopt. I’ve
asked many executives when they intend
to make the swap and seek local designs
—one year, five years, ever. They all
say nothing. They fail to realise that,
in the long run, profits will be greater
from the home-grown product.”
The demand for industrial designers
is undoubtedly growing. However,
there is still a surplus each year and the
number of graduates from technical
schools is rising. Designers believe that
as long as industry takes the easy way
out when gathering the blueprints for a
product, and as long as the nation con-
tinues to be a worse than mediocre ex-
porter of manufactured goods, the sur-
plus is likely to continue.
MADMEN AND PRISONERS
bulletin
80 Years Ago: April 18, 1885
Tn the absence of Press espionage,
very little is known of the secrets
of the prison house, and that little
leaks out only when a prisoner dies
during incarceration, or attempts
suicide, or maims or murders one of
his keepers. It is not many months
since the exposure was abruptly made
that one of the female prisoners was
pregnant through instrumentality of a
relative of one of the officers; and
again that whilst one warder was dis-
missed for robbing the cook-house,
another provincial official was “al-
lowed to resign” for visiting the cell
of two female prisoners by night.
Under the present long-sentence re-
gime a large proportion of prisoners
go mad under confinement. The
prisoner Barry had the misfortune to
lose his reason, and eight months ago
was adjudged by Drs Manning and
O’Connor' to be a lunatic. A few days
ago he was returned from the Criminal
Lunatic Asylum labelled “malingerer”.
As showing that his madness was only
feigned, the gaol surgeon gave evi-
dence that the day the prisoner sui-
cided, he found him quite rational,
and “in the kindest possible terms
advised him to avoid giving the
authorities any trouble”. The prisoner
literally adopted the counsel given
him, by hanging himself the same
night with a cord pilfered from his
hammock. The bare conjecture the
man was mad, and that the doctors
misjudged the case, is too terrible to
dwell upon. But these periodical
glimpses into the tendency of prison
immurement manifest the propriety of
investigation into the modern system
of extirpating crime, which seldom (if
ever) reforms its subjects, but trans-
forms a visible percentage of them
into madmen and malingerers.

“Hitherto ... but no Further”
7Jo sooner had President Johnson
given his important speech on
South Vietnam at Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity last week than the advocates of
negotiation and those who have had
various misgivings about the American
policy of retaliation against North Viet-
nam joined the President’s supporters
to proclaim the speech as an act of
statesmanship, wise, sane and con-
structive.
It certainly was all those things but
perhaps for reasons different than those
which many of his previous critics
would be prepared to accept. It is no
detraction from President Johnson’s
great speech to say that it was as much
politic as it was statesmanlike, as much
re-affirmation of the old as exploration
of the new. In its essentials there was
no radical departure from previous
American policy. It conceded some-
thing to critics and fortified supporters.
To this extent it was the speech of a
politically seasoned and magnificently
able leader of competing groups and
factions; assuring allies, bringing to-
gether opponents in his own party and
Administration. In its style it was in the
tradition of the “We shall overcome”
speech on Civil Rights to the US Con-
gress last month, showing a similar
concern for a human and peaceful end
to bitter and cruel violence. Neither
speech glossed over ugly realities, but
both looked beyond present conflicts
ahead to a future where President
Johnson’s grand vision of the American
Dream would be translated from his
own native Texas to the Mekong Delta
and to this extent it was statesman-
like.
The proposals for massive economic
development programmes are generous
and deserve the widest support but
President Johnson presented the plan
to his Cabinet three weeks ago and
spoke of it publicly; the Administra-
tion has discussed such proposals for at
least six months. The United States
has also said before that it wants no
wider war, that it has no designs on
Hanoi's government, that it does not
want to conquer North Vietnam, that
if North Vietnam does not stop its
policy of directing and aiding the Viet-
cong the attacks over the border will
continue, that over the whole future
of South-East Asia hangs the shadow
of an expansionist Communist China,
that aggression cannot be counten-
anced, that as in Europe there is a
point in South-East Asia at which the
United States will say, “Hitherto shalt
thou come but no further”, and that
that point has been reached in South
Vietnam.
Yet on very few previous occasions
have critics of American policy
accepted these aspects, at worst insist-
ing that the US was the party in the
struggle to blame and at best failing
to question the North Vietnam aggres-
sion in the same outraged way as they
questioned American defence. Was it,
then, President Johnson’s use of the
phrase “unconditional discussions”
which was radically new? President
Johnson answered himself when he
said: “We have stated this position
over and over again 50 times and
more to friend and foe alike.” What,
then, was new? For it would be wrong
to think that all President Johnson has
done is say something which means
all things to all men. In an unusual pre-
lude to the speech, three men who have
a decisive say in advising the President
on Vietnam, Under-Secretary of State
Mr George Ball, Defence Secretary
Mr Robert McNamara and Presiden-
tial Adviser Mr George Bundy, ex-
plained to reporters the “context” in
which it was being made. It is worth
noting that they stressed overwhelm-
ingly two things: the changed nature
of the military situation in South Viet-
nam in the last year due to North
Vietnam’s policy of increasing the men
and materials being sent to the South,
President Johnson’s intention to ex-
plore a “wider, deeper and long-
range” means of moving towards
peace.
There are still serious dangers, and
those who are praising President John-
son for his “conciliation” should say
where they stand on the risks. What
the United States learnt about the
delay in making its painful but neces-
sary decision to take the war to North
Vietnam was that when she finally
acted there were many, the North
Vietnamese as well as some of her
allies, who doubted her resolve and
who were confused about her aims and
purposes. They had been stated in
scattered speeches, they were clear to
those governments like our own who
in the last analysis depend on the
United States for protection, but they
were doubted for different reasons by
different groups ranging from the
Vietcong to the natural anti-Americans
of the Left wing in countries like
Britain and Australia who, in one way
or another, accept what Mao Tse-tung
says about the United States.
Speaking to a group of French
officials recently (as reported on p.
34), he said: “If the US continues
fighting, they, too, will face another
Dien Bien Phu. The Americans have
not had your experience, but they
refuse to heed your advice.” In a
certain sense he was quite right. The
United States may well face a decisive
military confrontation in Vietnam, if
the policy of escalation continues. But
what President Johnson has now ex-
plicitly undertaken and what is new is
a commitment which accepts that a
Dien Bien Phu comes only when there
is no real will or reason to win. On
this he gave his own answer to Hanoi
and Mao Tse-tung. “We will not be
defeated. We will not grow tired. We
will not withdraw, either openly or
under the cloak of a meaningless
agreement. We know that air attacks
alone will not accomplish all these pur-
poses. But it is our best and prayerful
judgment that they are a necessary part
of the surest road to peace. We hope
that peace will come swiftly. But that is
in the hands of others besides our-
selves.”
' There can be no real excuses now
for not knowing why Australia should
support American policy in Vietnam.


THIS AUSTRALIA
ELECTIONS
The Big Four Come to Town
“That's a bit of a smear ”
SIR ROBERT MENZIES
R. W. ASKIN
CANBERRA The NSW election
campaign is remarkable for the surpris-
ing participation of Federal Parliamen-
tarians of all parties—surprising because
the 1962 election was notable for the
lack of Federal weight behind the State
machines. This year things are different.
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies,
entered the campaign enthusiastically and
early—so early that the “Canberra
Times” led its story on April 6 of his
address to a Liberal rally at Sydney
Town Hall with the heading: “Prime
Ministers Opens NSW Campaign”.
The Deputy Prime Minister and
Country Party Leader, Mr John
McEwen, will campaign in various key
electorates and early in March released
his Press secretary, Mr Bill Carew, to
take up the position of director of the
NSW Country Party campaign.
For some weeks past NSW Liberal
MHRs have been addressing meetings
With their State colleagues, mainly in
extra-metropolitan centres where election
interest cannot be aroused overnight, and
reporting a marked absence of ALP
counter-activity.
These factors directly caused the ap-
pearance in Paddington Town,Hall of
the Federal Opposition Leader, Mr A.
Calwell, despite the known reluctance of
the NSW ALP machine. It would have
been too obvious a slur to ignore the
Federal Labor Leader while Liberal and
Country Party members were welcoming
the support of their Federal leaders. But
staunch NSW’s ALP men were still quick
to point out that Mr Calwell spoke for
only a few minutes as one of a support-
ing cast behind Mr J. Renshaw when he
By David Robertson
delivered Labor's policy speech. Mr
Calwell's deputy, Mr Whitlam, also will
appear, in the closing stages of the cam-
paign, at Bondi with the Minister for
Housing, Mr Landa, on April 29.
Why the keenness of the Federal
reigning coalition to get into NSW itself
and to force Mr Calwell into the ring?
Primarily the reason is not so much the
belief that Labor can be tossed out
after ruling for 24 years next month,
but the conviction that a NSW Labor
defeat can ruin the ALP Federally for
years to come.
NSW has successfully and adroitly
avoided the stormy weather that has
beset the ALP at every level for 10 years
in Victoria in particular and in Queens-
land, Western Australia and Federally.
A loss in NSW would inevitably lead to
the opening up of issues kept firmly
closed so far. With NSW engaging in
post-mortems and bitterness resulting
from the shock of defeat, the ALP's
greatest bastion of unity would be taken
away.
In his speech in Sydney, Sir Robert
Menzies immediately jeized the oppor-
tunity to identify the State Labor
Government “occasionally casting itself
for the role of a Right-wing Party” with
the Labor Party all over Australia and
to then assert that the Labor Party had
“fallen increasingly into the clutches of
the extremists”. He went on: “Union
after union has been infiltrated by Com-
munists . . . the Left wing at Canberra
develops more and more its position as
the spokesman of Labor on foreign
affairs . . . the Left wing of the Labor
Party hates America and hates every-
thing that the Americans do”.
In Parliament last Wednesday, reply-
ing to a questioner who referred to his
appearance in Sydney, Sir Robert said:
“I have never said that all members of
the Labor Party are pro-Communist. On
the contrary I have said there are mem-
bers on the extreme Left in the Labor
Party whose views get very close to
those of the Communists.”
When Mr Calwell interjected: “That's
a bit of a smear,” Sir Robert retorted
that Mr Calwell, “who has really made
more offensive observations in the last
six months than any other member in
the House, is very sensitive about me
saying to an extreme Left-winger that
he is so close to the Communists that
he ought to be careful and his Party
ought to be careful.”
This was probably deliberate goading
of Mr Calwell as a tactic to push him
A. CALWELL


into a defence of Labor’s Left wing and
it will be interesting to see the results.
Apart from his broadsides on the in-
fluence of extremists on the ALP, Sir
Robert Menzies has taken two points of
entry into the NSW campaign—defence
and the intrastate airlines issue. On
defence his theme is that if there is one
thing on which Australians should stand
together it is defence and security.
Mr Calwell has said several times, of
course, that Australia must present a
bipartisan view on foreign affairs and
the necessity for defence, and on this
Labor was hopelessly divided. Sir
Robert returned to the airlines dispute
with a compromise solution shrewdly
designed to back Mr Renshaw into the
position that if he refused to agree to
a conference of Commonwealth and
State experts —which would take two
months and carry the dispute beyond the
election date (May 1) —he could be
electorally accused of preventing the
people of Dubbo and district getting an
early resumption of direct air services.
Mr Renshaw replied that Sir Robert
had revealed publicly a month-old pro-
posal hitherto discussed privately which
NSW would accept if East-West Airlines
and Airlines of NSW flew month about
in the meantime, a proposition the Com-
monwealth rejects as economically im-
possible. In this issue, Sir Robert
Menzies must have picked up votes for
the State Liberal-CP coalition through
making the running while Mr Renshaw
still has not succeeded in restoring an
air service to an important area of the
State which includes centres in his own
electorate.
Sir Robert Menzies’s participation in
a NSW election campaign, to use one
of his favorite expressions, has the charm
of novelty, but like most of his political
action in the last 16 years, may prove
to show the assurance of sound timing
and judgment. Certainly Mr R. W.
Askin (Leader of the NSW Opposition)
hopes it will show just that.

UNIVERSITIES
“God-Professor”
A look at the Martin Report
MELBOURNE The new Socialist
youth magazine “Partisan” in its second
issue, published this week, looks at the
Martin Report from an unusual angle
and in the process attacks a recent staff
appointment in Melbourne University's
frequently controversial Political Science
Department. “Partisan”, taking a logical,
but unusual line for Australian socialists,
suggests that since Governments are now
bestowing multi-millions of pounds of
public funds on universities, it is time
that they exercised more control, or at
least surveillance over university admini-
stration.
The magazine admits that the prospect
of allowing Government bureaucracies
supervisory rights on the campus is not
initially attractive, but claims that
governments will almost certainly be
forced to play a more important role in
the running of universities because the
universities are unable to prevent
scandals in administration and malprac-
tices in staff appointments.
The failure of Professor J. P. Baxter to
appoint Russell Ward to a lectureship at
the University of New South Wales,
after he had been recommended by a
competent selection committee, and the
initial handling of the Orr Case by the
University of Tasmania are supplied as
two well-known examples of administra-
tive injustice. Moving closer tp home
“Partisan” claims that as well as The
BuLLETiN-exposed malpractices in the
Melbourne University Social Studies and
Criminology Departments, a recent ap-
pointment in the Political Science School
has set Melbourne's academic tongues
wagging. It alleges that “a brilliant first-
class honors graduate in Political Science,
and competent part-time tutor in that
subject last year, was ignored for appoint-
ment to a tutorship this year and prefer-
ment for the job given instead to a
pass graduate in Law”.
It also alleges that “capriciousness” is
not infrequent in appointments to posi-
tions in the Political Science Department,
and that the ignoring of the obviously
best-qualified man in this latest case was
responsible for cynicism amongst poli-
tics students about the relations between
academic achievement and their chance
of getting a staff job.
There has been a growing interest
amongst academics in the establishment
of an independent and statutory appeals
tribunal as a safeguard against prejudice,
favoritism, and incompetence in the ap-
pointment of university staff. This
latest allegation by “Partisan” is bound
to increase the demand for such a tri-
bunal especially by student clubs, which
are mostly run by students with acade-
mic ambitions. The Melbourne Univer-
sity ALP Club has already discussed the
possibility of attempting to get a resolu-
tion passed at the next Victorian Labor
J. P. BAXTER
Party conference calling for the estab-
lishment of more Government surveil-
lance of universities and for the setting
up of an appeals tribunal. Perhaps the
days of one of Australia’s oldest institu-
tions, that of the “god-professor”, are
now numbered.
AWU
“Rotten”
SA branch suspended
ADELAIDE In a bitter outburst,
the general secretary of the AWU, Mr
Tom Dougherty, last week called the
SA branch of the Union “rotten and dis-
gusting”. An AWU investigating com-
mittee, consisting of two delegates from
each State, came to SA to try to settle
internal differences which have disrupted
the branch for more than a year and
promptly suspended members of the SA
Executive. The Federal executive will
now run the branch for several months.
The internal differences in the SA
branch have been caused by the battle
for control between the branch’s sec-
retary of 15 years, Mr E. H. O'Connor,
and the Left-wingers, led by Mr Don
Cameron. In the recent poll, the Left-
wingers gained complete control of the
branch. Before the poll closed, however,
O'Connor successfully sought a Com-
monwealth Industrial Court enquiry into
alleged irregularities in the ballot. In
a surprise decision, the Chief Judge of
the Industrial Court, Sir John Spicer,
found evidence of irregularities in the
course of the ballot, but judged that they

could not have affected the result, and
he rejected the application to have the
election declared void.
It was proved that about 70 votes
were improperly filled in by people other
than those entitled to cast their votes.
But Sir John was unable to reach any
conclusion as to the mysterious parcel
of mutilated ballot papers sent in a
water-logged condition to the “Manejer
AWU Union Adelaide”. His judgment
means the new AWU officials in SA
will take over in June.
It is a vain hope by Mr Dougherty
that the AWU investigation into the
affairs of the SA branch will mean that
the branch will “achieve harmonious
relationships in the future”. The new
secretary is the younger brother of Mr
Clyde Cameron, MHR. Clyde Cameron
kept well in the background during the
recent poll, but he is still a powerful
influence on the AWU in SA. The
success of his brother’s ticket puts the
SA branch behind him in his dispute
with the Federal AWU leadership.
LICENSING LAWS
A Mirage
Advancing and fading
MELBOURNE Like a vision in the
desert, Melbourne's prospects of 10
o’clock closing seem to be forever advan-
cing and fading, ranging into the fore-
ground of the political landscape and
then retreating over the horizon. After
the Liberal Party changed its policy
demanding a referendum to approve new
trading hours and Mr P. D. Phillips, QC,
said in his report that 10 o'clock closing
would not increase liquor consumption,
or the social problems associated with
liquor, the prospect of 10 o’clock
closing “in our time'’ seemed certain.
The State Liberal Government, how-
ever, does not hold a majority in the
Legislative Council and needs the sup-
port of either the ALP or the Country
Party to get its legislation. At the
Country Party annual policy-making
conference last week only 6 out of 700
delegates voted against a motion which
reaffirmed the Party’s opposition to later
hotel closing without a referendum. A
delegate from the tiny northern town of
Quambatook seemed to express the feel-
ing of the conference when she criticised
the Liquor Commission’s reliance on
“cold, hard figures” which did not tell
the whole story of liquor and its effects.
Some Country Party Members of
Parliament claim that the conference
does not oblige them to vote against
later closing if they request one and the
Government fails to agree. It is doubt-
ful, however, if this casuistry will be
maintained in the voting chamber. The
Government is now waiting anxiously for
the State ALP decision on the matter.
The Labor Leader, Mr C. Stoneham, has
assured Cabinet that he has no doubt
that the ALP will be guided by the find-
ings of Mr Phillips, but the proposal to
abandon the referendum is bound to
arouse fierce opposition, especially from
country ALP members. The awful
feeling is growing in Melbourne that the
whole issue of 10 o'clock closing is a
diabolic mirage to torment the thirsty
evening wanderer through the city’s flat
terrain.

tional control within the States merits
more attention. Education has always
been one of the States’ biggest tasks. To-
day, it is easily their largest single respon-
sibility, yet its administration has changed
little in half a century.
In NSW, a Public Service Board, set
up in 1902 to administer a system with
6000 teachers and less than a quarter of
a million students, continues to control
30.000 teachers who teach three-quarters
of a million students. The only recogni-
tion of the vast changes in education has
been the addition of one “educationist”
to the Board (in 1955). There has been
a similar growth in other States and a
similar failure to adapt. The results are
constantly observed by local and overseas
investigators: education is over-central-
ised and hag-ridden by conservative
public service methods.
According to the Federation, the role
of an Education Commission would be
the formulation and administration of
educational policy, including the control
of teachers. Other States, such as Vic-
toria, which have taken education away
from the Public Service Boards, have left
policy with the Education Departments
and put teachers under the control of a
Tribunal. This latter solution has largely
been the work of teachers. It, too, can be
criticised on the grounds that the public
is overlooked.
The aim in setting up an Education
Commission (or an even larger statutory
controlling body like that proposed by
the Victorian ALP last year) should be to
get advice and policy flowing directly to
the Government from the public and
from teachers, rather than exclusively
from the public service.
TOBACCO
The Quotas
Minimum price of 125d. a lb.
BRISBANE The Queensland Minis-
ter for Primary Industries, Mr J. A.
Row, announced last week that his de-
partment had reached an advanced stage
in planning for the introduction of quotas
under the tobacco industry stabilisation
scheme. Although it would take some
time to draw up the proposals, said Mr
Row, growers would soon be given an
indication of their likely quotas for the
coming year. Final quotas could not be
allocated until later this year when neces-
sary legislation, approved of by Cabinet,
had been passed.
The tobacco stabilisation scheme will
involve the Commonwealth as well as
State Governments in Queensland, NSW
and Victoria, and complementary legisla-
tion will be needed to give legal sanction
to the scheme. Agreement has been
reached on the proposals by all States and

the scheme is to operate initially for four
seasons. The Commonwealth Govern-
ment has undertaken to ensure that, if
available, 26 million pounds of Austra-
lian leaf of acceptable grades is bought
each year by manufacturers at an aver-
age minimum price of 125 d. per pound
on a normal crop fallout. (Queensland’s
share of the 26 million pounds has been
set at 14 million pounds.)
An Australian Tobacco Board will be
set up to supervise the scheme at the
Commonwealth level and in the mean-
time an interim committee is carrying
out this function. The proposed board
will consist of representatives of growers
from the State Tobacco Leaf Marketing
Boards, and representatives of tobacco
manufacturers and State Governments
with a Commonwealth appointed chair-
man.
Mr Row said the responsibility of
allocating the State quota amongst
growers would rest with the State. To
do this equitably and fairly, the Govern-
ment intended to set up a special
Tobacco Quota Committee, and also to
make provision for appeals to a tribunal.
Meanwhile, the interim committee, with
the Assistant Director of Marketing of
the Department of Primary Industries,
Mr D. P. Lapidge, is carrying out basic
work in order to determine quotas.
CENSORSHIP
3 to 2
Getting into its stride
AUCKLAND The New Zealand
Indecent Publications Tribunal last week
cleared the five-shilling Penguin paper-
back of “Lady Chatterley” for sale by a
3 to 2 majority, in line with allowing the
sale of the unexpurgated hardback of the
book. In its decision, the Tribunal said
the book was unsuitable for juveniles, but
to classify it as such would be futile.
Obviously this has caused dissension
among the Tribunal members. Those who
voted against the decision said they re-
gretted the circulation of the hard cover
edition had clouded the issue. “This has
embarrassed the Tribunal and prejudiced
the case,” they said. “It has stopped us
invoking the Indecent Publications Act
in a particularly clear instance. The
majority finding was one of expediency
rather than principle.”
Getting into its stride after a year in
existence, the Tribunal has declared an-
other two books indecent this time
with reservations. Both books are transla-
tions from the French. One contains two
short novels by Apollinaire, “The De-
bauched Hospodar” and “Memoirs of a
Young Rakehell”; the other is de Sade's
“Justine” (which has just been published
commercially in England for the first
time.) The Tribunal described the Apol-
linaire book as “undoubtedly obscene”,
and restricted circulation only to persons
professionally engaged in the study of
abnormal psychology who desired to use
the book for that purpose.
Tribunal chairman Sir Kenneth Gres-
son said that de Sade’s “Justine” was in
quite another category: “It must be con-
ceded that it is a seriously written work,
somewhat philosophic in character, and
though the episodes related are revolting,
the language used to describe them is not
foul or offensive.”
The Tribunal accordingly classified the
book as indecent unless its circulation
was restricted to psychologists or psychia-
trists or any adult bona fide student of
literature or philosophy. The books, the
property of a Christchurch carpenter who
is an artist and book collector, had
earlier been seized by the Customs De-
partment. The restrictions are the first of
their kind to be imposed by the Tribunal.
Mickey Spillane’s “The Snake” has
wriggled out with a reprieve.

Stabilisation period ends
SYDNEY Whether doctors will
charge higher fees when a two-year stabi-
lisation period ends on June 30 will not
be decided until the Federal conference
of the Australian Medical Association in
Sydney at the end of next month. Dr
L. Wing, who retired as State president
of the association last week, said all
aspects of doctors’ fees would be dis-
cussed.
A report on a 12 months’ survey of
doctors’ costs was recently completed
by a Sydney firm of chartered accoun-
tants and would be discussed at the con-
ference. Medical men say the fees are
not expected to vary more than the
changes revealed by the survey in the
period. Reports that the fees would be
doubled were so wrong as to be hysteri-
cal, they said.
There was considerable controversy
two months ago when a Sydney doctor
in “The Medical Journal of Australia”
claimed that general practitioners should
increase their surgery fee from 255. to
£3 a visit. The doctor, who remained
anonymous, said in the article that
general practitioners were financially
hard hit. Consultation fees had risen
from 10s. to 255. in the past 50 years.
He said a doctor was entitled to recover
from a patient 150 per cent above the

Another Sydney doctor claimed in the
Press that a cleaner was paid more an
hour than many doctors. He said a
general practitioner alone worked 60
hours a week for a take-home pay of
10s. an hour. A doctor in sole practice
with a gross income of £SOOO a year
paid £3625 in expenses. This left him

WESTERN AUSTRALIA
The Beetles
A breakdown in the battle
PERTH With less than a month
before cotton-picking time. Western Aus-
tralia’s Ord project has had another set-
back with the poisoning of nine men
spraying insecticides over the 20 planta-
tions covering 5500 acres. At top level,
the rumpus continues over Dr Bruce
Davidson’s book, “The Northern Myth”,
which aims at exploding claims that the
Ord is worth further Commonwealth
backing. But in the rich, black loams of
the Ord flood plain, the cotton farmers
are more concerned about a grey-green,
pencil-thick bug, the prodenia, that is
cotton’s No. 1 enemy throughout the
world.
Increasingly potent sprays are being
used against it. The prodenia, with a
life cycle of only a few weeks, can create
a plague in frighteningly short time.
It has been found that some strains have
built up immunity to some insecticides
used at the Ord. The exact picture is
hard to define. All information from
official sources is carefully screened; the
Ord is 1800 miles by road from Perth.
Three helicopters and one fixed-wing
aircraft had been at work against pro-
denia and friends. When two of the
ground workers went off sick with head-
aches and nausea, all nine in the in-
secticide squad were called out for a
blood test . . . and were told to change
jobs because of their low cholinesterase
level. (Cholinesterase is an enzyme in
the bloodstream that controls nervous
reaction.) Since the scare the three
helicopters with about eight replace-
ment workers wearing regulation overalls
and full covering to stop the poison
getting through their skin—are back at
work, though the aircraft has been
grounded.

GRINNELL
Automatic Sprinkler
and
Fire Alarm System
i
In many instances, businesses never re-open after
a serious fire. When they do they seldom fully
recover. The reasons are obvious: records are
destroyed, customers—no matter how loyal and
sympathetic—must go elsewhere, often to stay.
Business cannot afford fire—but business can
afford Grinnell.
The Grinnell Automatic Sprinkler and Fire Alarm
System stands guard 24 hours a day ready to
extinguish fire as it starts.
Grinnell is the one certain way to put fire out of
business.

Australia as a “Little Detroit”
The future lies in more new models more often
By ALAN DEAR
When the first Australian-assembled
car appeared on our-roads around
1925, it heralded the rapid growth
of an industry as fascinating as it is com-
plicated, as competitive as it is powerful.
The car was Ford's —a Tin Lizzie—but
even its father, Henry, who pioneered
mass production techniques in the world,
would find little resemblance between the
car and the industry today. The auto-
motive industry, be it in Detroit, Coven-
try, Milan, Wolfsburg or Melbourne, is
a massive employer, both in its own
right and in the many and varied pro-
cesses and products it requires. It is
a good provider, too, with the average
worker receiving comparatively higher
pay and greater fringe benefits than his
brother in other industries. It employs
highly specialised techniques of produc-
tion and marketing and is high on the
list of contributors to the Gross National
Product.
It is no less an important industry in
Australia than it is anywhere else in the
world. By 1962-63 vehicle manufacture
and repair occupied about 135,000
people and the value of production
reached £225 million, or 9.4 per cent of
the national total of production. The in-
dustry has a huge investment in Australia
which, however, is difficult to assess.
Estimates range from £4OO million to
£6OO million. It is certainly no less than
£4OO million and could easily exceed the
higher figure.
The industry started almost casually
in Australia. The first body was made
in 1900 and 26 years later.we had two
vehicle assemblers—Ford and General
“Motors, using Australian-made bodies.
Political moves in 1930 pushed the in-
dustry upon a long road, which it has
covered in a remarkably short space of
time. In that year tariffs were applied
to certain vehicle components. Just
before World War II the Federal
Government offered a bounty of £3O on
engines of 15 horsepower or more made
in Australia by an Australian-owned
company. An offer was made to Aus-
tralian Consolidated Industries to pro-
mote engine and chassis manufacture.
Lacking the necessary technical know-
ledge, and placing more emphasis on
glass-making, ACI shook its head. Then
came the greatest stimulus the industry
has had in this country—the invitation
to General Motors to establish an Aus-
tralian motor industry. Since then GM
and the industry have never looked back.
General Motors-Holden's first vehicle
was unveiled in 1948. Now, 17 years
and 1,417,000 Holdens later, GM-H is
the leader in our automotive industry,
a leader whom, as one rival maker put
it, “nobody can catch"’.
Nevertheless, the enormous market
potential evident in Australia in the ’sos
attracted other overseas firms. Now
there are five big manufacturers and two
big assemblers. In terms of market share,
GM-H is indisputably largest. Then
comes Ford, the British Motor Corpora-
tion, Chrysler, Volkswagen, and the two
assemblers (in order of size), Rootes and
Australian Motor Industries. These
seven companies, in 1964, shared 93.3
per cent of the market. The balance of
the market is divided between Japanese
and “others”. It is hard to tell accur-
ately just what proportion of the market
Japanese vehicles have in total, since
some are imported completely built up
(CBU) and others come in completely
knocked down (CKD). A fair slice of
Australian Motor Industries’ work is the
assembling of Japanese CKD vehicles.
Although a completely up-to-date figure
on the total Japanese share is not avail-
able, estimates put it as high as 10 per
cent —as much as Chrysler's.
Two of the most noticeable growths*,
in the market are that of Chrysler and
the Japanese sector. Chrysler's big
lift in market share came with the
introduction of its Valiant, a worry to
GM-H with its Holden and Ford with
its Falcon. At present there is no direct
Japanese competition for any of these
three vehicles—all priced around the
£I2OO mark. None of the big three
seem to be worried about the level of
Japanese CBU and CKD imports. David
Hegland, managing director of General
Motors-Holden’s in Australia, said:
“Competition from Japan and other Aus-
tralian manufacturers is not worrying us
at present because we.are selling all we
can produce. While there is no competi-
tion from Japan for the Holden, there is
for the Vauxhall Viva on price. But the
Viva has not been out long enough for
us to know what we can do with it and
whether the Japanese cars will affect its
share of the market.” The same holds
true for Ford and Chrysler. However,
further down the price scale there is
a little cause for concern. Primarily
affected here are BMC, Rootes, AMI
and VW. All of these companies mar-
ket cars under the £IOOO price level and


there is no doubt they have lost some
sales to the Japanese.
Mr Allan V. Gray, managing director
of Volkswagen Australasia Limited, said
Japanese vehicles at present are having
“a particular influence on the under
£IOOO market. Something new on the
market always attracts buyers. How
long it will go on remains to be seen”.
Mr R. Neave, manager of Australian
Motor Industries, which assembles the
Toyota Corona in Australia and brings
in CBU the Toyota Crown and the
Toyota 700 (the Crown will be assembled
in Australia later this year but not -the
700 because of its very small market),
feels there is a big market in Australia
for Japanese vehicles. “One of the
reasons they are selling at the moment
is the extras they carry,” he said.
This brings to the fore the enquiry
at present before the Tariff Board. It
seems likely, following the steep jump
in imported vehicles and components,
that the present tariffs on imported
bodies and parts could be increased by
10 to 15 per cent. This is an incentive for
local assemblers to increase Australian
content in vehicles, thus avoiding higher
costs. A scheme to increase the local
content of locally-assembled vehicles to
95 per cent is to start this year and will
operate for the next ten years. Basically
the scheme is this: if a company pro-
ducing a car with only 40 per cent Aus-
tralian content agrees to increase local
content, it has 18 months to raise it to
60 per cent, another 18 months to lift
it to 80 per cent, and a final two years
to get from 80 to 95 per cent. As an
incentive to increase Australian content,
companies which agree to the scheme
will be allowed to import components
duty-free while they build up local con-
tent. In the short-term the components
manufacturers will not be overjoyed
with the scheme, yet once local content
of all vehicles is raised to its maximum
the long-term benefits will be consider-
able.
What is the local content of popular
vehicles on Australian roads? GM-H is
not worried about the scheme —the
Holden is around 98 per cent local con-
tent. Ford is not particularly con-
cerned about the Falcon as it is around
the 90 to 95 per cent local content mark.
It will continue to import the big Galaxie
(priced at over £2600) since, as Ford
managing director Wally Booth put it:
“If people want a car in that price
bracket they are willing to pay extra for
it.” Ford’s highly popular Cortina is at
present around the 50 per cent mark
but plans are in hand to raise it to the
maximum level. Ford has this year de-
leted the Fairlane and the Anglia from
its range, so there are no worries there.
Volkswagen 1200 s (the Beetle) are at
present 74 per cent local content, though
by this time next year VW Australasia
will be making engines in Australia (only
the second country outside Germany to
do so; the other country is Brazil), which
will push it up to 87 per cent Australian-
made. Eventually, when transmissions
are made here, VW 1200 s will realise
the 95 per cent mark, but not until
December, 1968.
Local content
/Chrysler Australia Ltd, with its
Valiant, Simca and Dodge range of
vehicles, undoubtedly has plans to in-
crease Australian content. The British
Motor Corporation also plans to raise
local content. To do this BMC is spend-
ing £7 million in an expansion pro-
gramme over a three-year period. At
present its Morris 850 is 72 per cent
local content, the 1100 68 per cent,
Freeway and Wolseley range 75 per cent,
and the Austin-Healey Sprite and MG
“B” 40 per cent. Managing director
of BMC, Mr. R. L. (“Bill”) Abbott,
said the group would raise local
content to the required 95 per cent.
BMC's share of the new car and
station waggon market has levelled
out in recent years, due probably to
Japanese competition. By lifting local
content it will place itself in a much
more commanding position, even if the
Japanese do start to assemble their com-
plete range of vehicles in Australia.
There is a feeling in the dealer industry
that if CBU vehicles do have to pay
higher tax, the Japanese may drop some
of the extras (such as radios, etc., which
are supplied with the car) to compete
in price. This, said one dealer, is likely
to be detrimental to their share of sales.
The assemblers are in a more difficult
position. Mr W. J. Sullivan, managing
director of Rootes Australia, said his
company’s locally assembled vehicles
ranged in content from 45 to 50 per
cent. The company, however, has plans
to increase local content to the maxi-
mum. Rootes has reached an agreement
with Chrysler in South Australia
(the scheme has Government blessing)
under which Chrysler will build a car
of the Hillman Minx type. Local con-
tent of this car will attain the 95 per
cent mark. AMI also has plans to in-
crease local content and says that all
Japanese cars entering Australia could
be assembled locally. Mr Neave said:
“AMl’s production is currently between
35 and 55 per cent Australian content.
Japanese assembly here is a good com-
promise between local manufacture and
CBU imports. The industry has been
having a look at Australian component
manufacturers to see if some of the parts
that. are now imported can be locally
manufactured.”
Australian cars could probably never
economically be 100 per cent local con-
tent. For that matter it is unlikely that
any other car-producing nation in the
world could achieve such a figure.
GM-H’s Mr Hegland: “There are always
some small parts which cannot be econo-
mically manufactured here. In our
latest model, for instance, which is more
than 98- per cent local content, the im-
ported parts would not cover a dinner-
plate—and there are 17,000 parts in a
Holden.”
What of the design of our cars?
Broadly speaking there is no indigenous
Australian design. The latest Holden is
said to look like the German Opel (made
in Germany by General Motors).
Although there has been some departure
from the North American Falcon’s de-
sign, it is still basically the same. Valiant
looks like its American counterpart;
BMC’s range resembles that produced
in England; Volkswagen naturally re-
tains the world-wide 1200 and 1500
designs. Rootes and AMI assemble
only, so no Australian influence can be
exerted on design there.
In the past few years the automotive
industry in Australia has tended to move
towards a world-wide trend of almost
12-monthly design changes or facelifts
(Volkswagen excluded, because most of
the changes are of a mechanical nature
and never affect the car's basic lines).
Why so many changes? The industry’s
general answer is that it is only to satisfy
consumer demand. Another equally im-
portant reason is that, when designs are
made, the earlier models become obso-
lete faster and their value on the second-
hand market lessens. Mr Hegland said
more frequent design changes keep
plenty of cars on the market, and keep
the quality of the cars on the market
higher because people dispose of them
earlier. Ford's Mr Booth said: “Changes
over the next ten years will tend to in-
crease rather than lessen. Our first
Falcon was of pure North American
design, but since then the Australian and
the American models have grown apart
from each other.” To keep up with con-
sumer demand, Ford last year sent out
questionnaires to 6000 of the 42,000
people who bought the XM Falcon and
sought from them answers on the design
and performance of the car, as well as
on the customer’s satisfaction with ser-
vice, comparison with the owner's pre-
vious car and so on. “Answers to these
questions gave us an idea of what should
go in the latest model Falcon, the XP,
and also enabled us to correct in the run
of the XM some faults we had not
noticed in testing.”
Since Chrysler's Valiant has been in
Australia, two changes have been made,
one a rather radical alteration of the
first design and the second a more modi-
fied facelift. The first Valiants were
imported as forerunners to local produe-


tion. BMC tends more towards the
gradual model change and so far seems
to have concentrated a lot on the im-
provement of the interior design of its
popular 850 and 1100 Morrises. BMC’s
design changes, it explained, are on an
evolutionary basis rather than on fashion.
“Even if we could afford annual model
changes, we probably wouldn’t do it,” the
company said. Volkswagen, of course,
never changes. “Our policy is: if you
have something good, why change it?”
said Allan Gray. (Why change it in-
deed? If all over the world Volkswagen-
werk is producing one car every 16
seconds during working shifts, and says
it still can’t meet demand, there hardly
seems time, let alone any reason, to
change the design.) . Mr Gray continued:
“Planned obsolescence is becoming part
of the Australian motoring scene and
this tends to reduce the value of cars on
the second-hand market. But not VWs
—‘VWs don't drop in value overnight’ is
our slogan. This is because, in retain-
ing the basic body design, it is very hard
to pick model differences.”
The heart of the Australian motor in-
dustry is in Melbourne. There are
located General Motors, Ford, Volks-
wagen, Rootes and Australian Motor
Industries. BMC is in Sydney while
Chrysler's headquarters is in Adelaide.
Melbourne is a logical geographical
location for the industry, both from sales
and supply points of view. Furthermore,
the concentration of the industry in
Melbourne is not lessening. In 1961-62,
62 per cent of employment in manu-
facture and assembly was centred in
Melbourne. In 1948-49 employment
there totalled 56 per cent of the employ-
ment. The larger manufacturers have
branched out into other cities. GM-H,
for instance, manufactures and/or
assembles in every State except Tas-
mania. Ford has plants at Broad-
meadows and Geelong (Victoria) and in
Sydney and Brisbane. BMC has an
assembly plant in Melbourne. VW,
Rootes and AMI are in Melbourne only.
This raises the question of transport to
other capital cities. Road and rail are
both heavily used in transporting new
vehicles. Ford, at Broadmeadows, has
a railway loop line right into its plant
and splits transport 50-50 between road
and rail. Not all the other manufac-
turers are so fortunate and divide their
preferences between road and rail.
Shipping, too, is an important part of
freight, both for interstate and overseas
sales.
The largest manufacturer, GM-H, is
also the largest exporter. Since 1954 it
has exported 65,211 vehicles. Last year
exports reached an - all-time high of
13,693 units. This year, says David
Hegland, GM-H will send more than
*6CQO overseas. He adds that exports
act as a buffer against poor times on the
home market. GM-H exports in both
CKD and CBU form. Volkswagen is
an exporter in a much smaller way. It
too exports in CBU and CKD form, the
built-up units (which in 1964 totalled
202) going to the Pacific islands and
the East. During 1964 CKD units only
were exported to New Zealand. They
totalled 1704. Chrysler has almost
doubled its export of Valiants over the
last two years. In 1963, 2202 went over-
seas. Last year exports totalled 4188, an
increase of 90.2 per cent. Chrysler Aus-
tralia is now the source of right-hand-
drive Valiants to be exported to East
and South-East Asia.
The assemblers do not export at all.
However, the exporting manufacturers
expect overseas sales to increase. GM-H
expects to expand its export sales faster
than its domestic sales. It feels exports
are a good contribution to Australia,
“which in turn has been good to us”,
said Mr Hegland. Increasing exports
have established Australia as a major
supplier of right-hand-drive vehicles to
the East.
“If you have something good,
why change it?”
All this activity in the motor industry
has placed the Australian motorist
third on the world list of vehicle owner-
ship per person and eighth in terms of
annual vehicle output. Annual produc-
tion is now running at about 400,000
vehicles (including commercial vehicles)
a year, and manufacturers are not the
only ones to benefit from this. While
close on 400,000 new vehicles a year
come on to our roads, there are, one
authority estimates, ten times that
number to be serviced and repaired.
Such an enormous number of vehicles,
in terms of the size of our population
and the youth of the motor industry
here, means that we run about one
vehicle to every 3.9 people, roughly
the same as New Zealand, where, how-
ever, a much higher vehicle age has
resulted from that country’s policy of
import restrictions and non-manufac 2
turing. In terms of vehicle ownership
we run a good third to America and
Canada where the persons per vehicle
figure, respectively, is 2.4 and 3.4. In
this respect we rank ahead of such in-
dustrialised nations (with approximate
vehicle ownership figures in brackets) as
France (6), the UK (6.2), West Germany
(8.1), Italy (14), Japan (37) and Russia
(49), an obvious reflection of our high
standard of living. As far as vehicle
manufacture is concerned, we are well
down on the table. Nevertheless, our
production in relation to population is
high.
There appears to be some levelling out
in demand for motor cars in Australia.
According to the Institute of Public
Affairs’ “Review”, industry experts pre-
dict that new vehicle registrations this
year will increase by only 3 per cent
compared with 10 per cent last year, 16
per cent in 1963 and 36 per cent in
1962. While vehicle registrations are
not increasing by a large percentage, the
actual number of vehicles being pro-
duced is. After all, a semi-saturation
point must be reached at some time.
A moot point with the vehicle manu-
facturing industry, for as long as it has
been established here, is its complete
ownership by overseas companies, with
the exception of Rootes Australia (Aus-
tralians hold 471 per cent of equity
and preference capital) and Australian
Motor Industries (Australian, American
and British owned). For a while the
Australian investor could gain a partial
interest in General Motors-Holden’s by
purchasing its preference shares. Now
the only way is to lend money to
General Motors Acceptance Corpora-
tion, the group's finance subsidiary. It
seems highly unlikely that the overseas-
owned companies in the industry will
ever volunteer equity capital to the Aus-
tralian public. As hard as financial
circles in Australia try to justify reasons
for the manufacturers to offer equity
capital to the public, the industry ad-
vances reasons why it shouldn't. GM-H
points out that Australians can invest in
the parent companies (only if they have
capital overseas) and Volkswagen Aus-
tralia feels that, with the current expan-
sion taking place in the industry,
investors would not be highly delighted
with the calls that would be inevitably
made on their money. An investment in
VW’s parent company would probably
be a sounder move than a local partici-
pation, as witness Ford Australia's re-
cently disclosed £5 million loss. Any
spread of business in the world motor
industry is a much sounder safeguard
against market fluctuations than a paro-
chial interest. More to the point is the
fact that the motor industry is not as
highly profitable as the general public
is led to believe. A recent Current
Affairs Bulletin pointed out that “even
GM-H profits, which are so much higher
than their Australian rivals, are not
markedly higher than GMC profits in
America. In 1963 GM-H earned net
profits of 10.8 per cent on sales against
GMC’s 9.7 per cent, and 24.2 per cent
on net assets against GMC’s 22.4 per
cent . . . Several other overseas com-
panies in Australia are earning lower
rates than their parents.’’
Australia’s motor industry cannot help
but grow. As long as there are roads
and people, there will be a demand for
cars. At what rate the demand will con-
tinue to grow can only be a guess. One
thing is certain, however —it will not go
backwards.

The Most Ecumenically
Minded Bloke
“Why has the Devil the best music?”
By CHARLES HIGHAM
“Tt’s become a kind of Frankenstein!”
the surfie parson, Rev. Roger Bush,
said with a cheerful smile. He was re-
ferring to his triple chore of answering
letters by the distressed in the “Sunday
Mirror”, Sydney, running three parishes
in the outer suburbs, and appearing on
television and radio in a programme
called “In Between”. What had got him
going? “It’s all part of the changing
nature of the church. Not only the
ecumenical bit from Rome, Charles.
Throughout the world the church is look-
ing for ways to reach the community.
“When I came to Sydney from South
Grafton three and a half years ago I did
a few taped interviews with young people
up the coast. Jim Peters, director of
religious broadcasting at the ABC ap-
proached me to do ‘ln Between’. It’s a
shocking time-slot, 10 a.m. of a Satur-
day, in between the Symphony Hour and
the Stars of Opera. Somehow or other,
though, it caught on. It starts with the
Manhattan Spiritual, the jazz bit, you
know. Then we go into a pretty hot
sort of record, but religious, and I play
a segment of tape from the 1700 or so
interviews with young people I’ve done.
“I’ve interviewed Peter, Paul and
Mary, Brook Benton, Cilia Black . . .
these are the idols of the teenrgers, and
when you get them into a room they tell
you about their spiritual lives . . . that
interests young people . . . for instance,
Brook Benton reads his Bible every
night. And there’s Lovelace Watkins, a
very fine Christian lad.
“I say, ‘Have you any religious con-
victions?’ and we play it by ear from
there. I remember a couple who were
in a show a year or so ago . . . what was
their name . . . Derek . . . yes, that’s
right! Derek Farr and Muriel Pavlow.
The depths of sanctity in their marriage
was something worth hearing, I can tell
you.
“I get fantastic letters. Since I began
69 weeks ago I’ve had more than 603
letters on average in a year. Of course
I do far more intimate work off the
programme than I do on.
“And then there’s the ‘Sunday Mirror’
bit. I always say, elections are won
through the tabloids, not through the
‘Sydney Morning Herald’ or ‘The Bul-
letin’. I met Hugh Bingham, the ‘Sun-
day Mirror’ editor . . . he's got a place
opposite a weekender I had at Avalon,
and he heard some of my tapes. He said:
‘Would you mind jotting down some of
your ideas?’ It made up a two-page
article called ‘The Baffled Generation’,
and poor old Grahame’s are waiting for
a book of the same title from me.
“That started the column. It began a
bit Dorothy Dix-y, but got better. It’s
grown out of all proportion. I get 40-80
letters a week. Here’s a bundle here.
From the whole range of society. Every
conceivable religion. I’m the parson
and my parish is the ‘Sunday Mirror’.
Four hundred and forty thousand people
in my parish, you see ... I tell you,
Charles, no one ever had a parish like
that . . .
“I’ve had letters from girls who have
been pack-raped, among others . . . It's
no wonder, the way advertising is these
days. I read ‘The Carpetbaggers’ the
other day. What a well-written book that
was. You can see the effect it would
have.
“It contains instruction on every
variety of sexual intercourse.
“Where my secret lies is that I’m
terribly interested in people. So much
of the church has become the middle-
class status bit, you know. It tends to
forget people are real human beings. I
want to help, not dispassionately but
passionately. Parents are indifferent to
their children, they don’t know what
they do. I try to reach the young people
through things like TV, radio, the ‘Sun-
day Mirror’.
“I see through things like the pages
of the ‘Sunday Mirror’ a tremendous
move forward in the religion of the 20th
century. You see, there’s a couldn’t-care-
less attitude among the adult population.
The young people express themselves in
‘Oz’, ‘Tharunka’—rubbish like that. And
we complain. But I try to interest them
in something different. In my Series for
Youth on TV, for instance, we have a
band of 22 young players, a couple of
young folk singers Joe and Janet
Noakes George Assang, he sings
spirituals, and later we’ll make the pro-
gramme more controversial.
“There’s an old saying, ‘The Devil has
the best music; why has the Devil the
best music?’ Some people say General
Booth said it, but / think it was George
Whitfield. We want to answer that ques-
tion. We're chock-a-block with music.
Brubeck’s type of thing, and so on. In
Bach’s day he thought nothing of taking
popular music and putting it into an
oratorio. You have to touch the young
people where they live. In the 17th
Chapter of John, J.C. Jesus Christ
said that people should not be taken out
of the world. The church should get
among the people more, become involved
in every field. I’m probably the most
ecumenically-minded bloke in Sydney.
But I don’t want to proselytise. I just
want to lead people to a deeper under-
standing of religion through a deeper
understanding of their own faith. In
the future, not in my lifetime, not in
yours, all religions will be the same.”
Welch’s Last Race
By FRED STAW
About 18 years ago a Texan
wrestler named “Dirty” Dick
Raines got especially ugly one
night as he climbed through the ropes for
his bout at the Melbourne Stadium. He
made a dive—terrible in its energy—
straight at the radio broadcaster stand-
ing in the ring to announce the match.
Eric Welch recalls that he smacked
Raines smartly over the ear with his
microphone and went right on talking.
The story goes that as Raines crashed
to the canvas with a wallop that echoed
in the bleachers, Welch announced: “And
in the red corner, ladies and gentlemen,
is Dick Raines all the way from
Texas.” Raines lost his bout that night
and didn't forgive Welch for years after.
“He was the last wrestler who ever
had a crack at me,” Welch says. “La
Verne Baxter was the first of five who
tossed me out of the ring over the years.


Les girls!
Historically, the girl out front might

By the time Raines came round for his
turn I was getting darned tired of it.”
Eric Welch, supremo sportscaster of
Melbourne radio and television, has re-
tired at 64 to his pub at Mornington.
He went into hospital with an internal
haemorrhage last February and took it
as a warning that it was time he eased
the pressure off. “Battling with the hotel
and long hours in TV were too much
for a man who has lived as long and as
much as me,” he said. “I’ve lived it up
in my time and I’ve had my share of
fun now I’m ready to take it quietly^’
He has leased the pub, 34 miles from
Melbourne on the Mornington Peninsula,
for the last 11 years since he gave up
working full-time in radio. “I’ve been a
terrible gambler in my time and I woke
up very early in life that I would never
have enough money to retire on,” he
said, “so I leased the hotel to keep me
going in my old age.”
He is tickled that his old mate Barry
Humphries, the long-haired Australian
comedian working in London, said in
The Bulletin recently that he loved
Portugal because it was “the Morning-
ton Peninsula of Europe”, and added,
“If only Eric Welch ran a pub down
there”.
Welch isn’t too sure of what lies
behind the Humphries sentiment about
that. He suspects him of some dubious
compliment —in that the Welch hotel
was just the right type to fit in with the
culture of Portugal where, Humphries
said, “one can relax without being
oppressed by great art”.
Welch’s pub is no temple of the
learned and lofty, he admits, but he
says that if Humphries wants it as the
final touch of Portugal “he can bloody-
well bring Portugal to Mornington. I’m
staying here”.
He has lived his entire life in Mel-
bourne, apart from a World War I stint
in France and England with the 14th
Battalion —he was under-age and a
job that lasted two years in New Guinea.
Welch went into radio work on a part-
time basis in 1925, giving racing tips
and race broadcasts over the ABC’s
stations, 3LO and 3AR, while he was
working as a racing writer for the old
Melbourne “Argus”, a job he fluked
when he was working in the paper’s read-
ing room.
He would probably still have been a
newspaperman if the Newspaper Pro-
prietors’ Association hadn’t issued an
edict in 1927 that no journalist could
work in radio if it conflicted with his
regular work.
“I left and went to radio full-time,
but there were no unpleasantness about
it. I’ve always got on with my employers
very well.”
Except, that is, for one brief episode
when the ABC sacked him in 1933. “To
this day nobody has been able to tell
me why. That’s reasonable, I supose
a man shouldn’t have to explain his
actions in case he winds up with a legal
action against him.”
Welch went on to make Australian
television history.
Apart from Geoff Corke, who began
on GTV-9 a week before him. Welch
has been in Melbourne TV longer than
anyone. “And 1 don’t know of anyone
still alive in Australia who was working
in radio before me,” he says.
He has given radio broadcast desarip-
tions of every Anzac Day march in Mel-
bourne since they began in 1927
except one he missed when he was in
hospital in 1950.
The Sexual Revolution
By MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
In Left-wing circles when I was young,
zealots would quite often speak with
faith and exaltation of the social
revolution which might confidently be
expected. To them it was a sort of
Second Coming, bound to happen even
though their old eyes might not be privi-
leged to witness it. Years of turmoil,
Stalin, disillusionment with a telly-
viewing, bingo-playing Welfare State, and
so on, have largely destroyed these
hopes. Few nowadays believe with any
conviction in an apocalyptic salvation
through revolutionary upheaval. The
Red Flag, like the Marseillaise before it,
has become a bourgeois hymn, celebra-
ting, if anything, Mr Attlee’s earldom,
Mr Wilson’s tailcoat and Mr Brezhnev’s
space satellites. Such revolutionary fer-
vor as still exists tends to run in Freud-
ian, not Marxist, channels. The survival
of England Arise! as a favorite at pro-
gressive gatherings may well be due to
the fact that it expresses a phallic aspira-
tion. In the mid-20th century, it would
seem, the workers of the world have
nothing to lose but their orgasms.
This is particularly the case in
America, where the sort of intellectual
fervor which in the ’thirties was dedi-
cated to the Spanish Civil War and other
Leftish causes, trailing off into espionage
for the USSR, now looks Kinseywards,
and beyond. Anti-Communism has suffo-
cated the American Left, whose devotees,
coughing and reeling, turn hopefully to
a new dawn of sexual liberation. Many
illustrious prophets and teachers have

pointed the way, from Wilhelm Reich to
Wayland Young. Reich, inventor of
the orgone box (in which, in times past,
distinguished writers like Saul Bellow
and Norman Mailer have taken their
seats with a view to charging their bat-
teries), and a prolific theorist and evan-
gelist, ended up a martyr to the cause,
while Dr Kinsey, a toiler in the vine-
yard of sex if ever there was one,
himself came to an early ‘ grave as a
result of his earnest endeavors on its
behalf. The work the doctor initiated
is being carried on at Indiana State
University, supported by the royalties on
his books and the munificence of Col-
gate’s toothpaste.
In any case, the sexual revolution,
unlike the social one, has actually hap-
pened. What is more, it has had the
tacit approval of the powers-that-be.
Clownish efforts have been made, ad-
mittedly, to censor particular books, and
even to persecute particular individuals,
but by and large established authority
and big business have been solidly
acquiescent. The great advertising in-
dustry, for instance, has helped by pro-
ducing a quenchless flow of effective, if
sometimes crude, propaganda in the form
of cheesecake and erotica of various kinds
and degrees. Faced with so formidable
an array of forces, pockets of resistance
like the Roman Catholic Church have
been forced on to the defensive, and even
to retreat.
Tt is not difficult to see why vested
A interests are liable to favor a sexual
revolution. Nothing is more calculated
to induce acceptance of the social and
economic status quo than erotic obses-
sions when they are divorced from love
or procreation. These, especially the
former, can prove subversive forces in
that they stimulate individual and par-
ticular emotions and loyalties, whereas
eroticism is generalised and therefore
conducive to a conformist state of mind.
Bread and circuses have to be paid for
by the State; pornography is cheap and
in plentiful supply. Marx said that re-
ligion was the opium of the people.
Sex is better.
Religion, in any case, cannot evade
posing certain moral propositions, how-
ever hypocritically and in however
muffled a form, which tend to promote
subversion. Thus Christianity has the
disadvantage, from this point of view,
of containing in its scriptures references
to, for instance, the unsavoriness of
riches, which are calculated to bring
millionaires into disrepute. Sex labors
under no such disability. It challenges
nothing, questions nothing. Unfolding
the month's playmate in “Playboy”, any
tendency to think and question things is
automatically extinguished. Vietnam
seems far, far away, and Alabama a
song, not a place. It is interesting, in
this connection, that, whereas the Un-
American Activities Committee assidu-
ously hunted down every kind of politi-
cal subversive, however obscure or crazy,
it never seriously bothered about sexual
subversives. Sex is American, and
therefore OK.
In the result, America is drenched, if
not submerged, in sex; as, of course,
are all the countries, like ours in process
of adopting the American way of life.
It permeates every corner and cranny of
life from birth to the grave. Dating
begins at nine years old and even earlier;
tiny tots wear padded bras, paint their
faces, and howl like randy hyenas at
the Beatles. Young lovers arm them-
selves with birth pills and the “Kama
Sutra”, and engage in erotic exercises
which might have seemed excessive in
the pages of “Les Liaisons Dangereuses”;
middle-aged couples swap partners, bone
up on soixante-neuf, and disturb the
peace of suburban nights with their stri-
dent love-cries. The old, their dentures
gleaming, look lecherously round, or
doze in their bathchairs over “Candy” or
“The Tropic of Cancer”. Even the
dead are curled and scented for a tumble
in the grave. The very worms must
swoon at the perfumed morsels offered
them.
Once the proposition is accepted that
the essential purpose of sex is pleasure,
which, thanks to the birth pill and other
contraceptive devices, can be indulged
in with impunity, everything else follows.
Americans are dedicated to the pursuit
of happiness; sexual pleasure is part of
that happiness, and orgasm its outward
and visible manifestation. Therefore
Americans are as entitled to orgasm as
they to broad highways, large motor
cars, washing machines and other appur-
tenances of an affluent society.
Teenagers petting in drive-in cinemas;
licit and illicit couples struggling, some-
times gymnastically, to follow out the
instructions of some sex-manual, ancient
or modern; solitary patrons of girlie
shows and porno bookshops, all are en-
gaged in the same quest—for orgasm.

may find it difficult over the years to
maintain the same diligence and enthusi-

asm. Sex counsellors urge them on,
recommending resort to astonishing de-
vices and acrobatics to revive flagging
appetites. They should stand on their
heads, or turn Catherine wheels, or (as
I recently read in a treatise on the
subject) try it under water, using diving
suits with easy-to-open zip fasteners and
specially long snorkels. If they will only
persist, keep fit, stoke up with the
appropriate vitamins, there is no reason
why the passage of time or the body’s
decay should prevent, or even abbreviate,
their sexual pleasure.
Even the most ardent advocates of the
sexual revolution are inclined to feel
that it is not working out quite as it
should. Instead of sex-happy citizens of
all ages piping through the valleys wild,
psychiatrists and sexologists are beseiged
by patients eager to pour out their sexual
woes. Orgasms have been too little and
too late; despite bodies duly sealed and
pasteurised, and recommended positions
duly taken, the promised delight has
failed to materialise. Happiness pursued
in accordance with the book has proved
elusive. Something must be wrong.
"Out what? Clearly it cannot be the
theory; to challenge that would be
to undermine the pursuit of happiness
itself. It must therefore be the practice.
Here, it is relevant to cast a glance at a
Sex Research directed by Dr
William H. Masters at the Washington
University of Medicine, for details of
which I am indebted to Dr Leslie H.
Farber, a distinguished psychiatrist prac-
tising in Washington DC. Dr Masters’
aim has been to isolate the female
orgasm in the laboratory with a view to
subjecting it to a close scientific examin-
ation, and to finding out how it can best
be promoted. In that sense, he may be
regarded as acting on behalf of all the
American males who, for one reason or
another, have failed to live up to the
sexual revolution in the eyes of their
mates.
The method he has adopted is to make
a color film (though without a sound-
track) of a series of self-induced female
orgasms, using for the purpose volun-
teers among the wives of faculty mem-
bers and students. Out of consideration
for the volunteers they appear in the
film only as torsos and hands.
This, surely, is the apogee of the sexual
revolution, the ultimate expression of the
cult of the orgasm —the American
Dream at last fulfilled. A cover-girl to
end all cover-girls; a broiler-house Mon-
roe; a Harlow transported into orgasmic
regions pure and undefiled, where she is
observed, not by libidinous dreamers,
but by scientists in white coats going
about their lawful laboratory occasions.
Love's mysteries in souls do grow, but
the body is his book. Dr Masters’ film
is the book itself; a torso and a hand.


OVERSEAS
On Today’s
Burma Road
General Ne Win as hermit alchemist
When the former Foreign Secretary, Mr Gordon Walker,
presented General Ne Win with a jewelled dagger as
an earnest of Britain’s intention to give back to Burma
the entire “Mandalay regalia”, he said he hoped Britain and
Burma would always be as close as the knife and its sheath.
There were high hopes in London that this might become
true. The General, founder of the Burma Socialist Programme
Party and impatient author of Rangoon’s high-speed nationali-
sation policy, could be expected to be more sympathetic
towards a Labor Government than to its predecessor.
Relieved of nagging sinus trouble during his visit to Britain
last year, General Ne Win appeared at his most affable. It
was then that Mr Harold Wilson happily implemented the
decision of the Conservative Government to return to the
Burmese the Royal Regalia—the “crown jewels” of Burma —
which the British had seized in Mandalay in 1885. And this
belated redress made a most favorable impression.
But the hopes have wilted sadly. The socialisation pro-
gramme, which since December, 1962, has virtually wiped
out British investments in Burma, continued unabated last
month when the Burma Corporation was taken over and
Burma Unilever was turned into “People's Soap Factory
Number One”.
No compensation has yet been paid, the Burmese will not
allow foreigners to take their assets out
of the country, and there are hardship
cases of elderly British subjects who are
stranded in Rangoon unable to transfer
their life savings elsewhere. The British
Council remains closed.
Foreigners are not the only sufferers, however. General
Ne Win has disbanded all types of association (unless purely
religious) and abolished all political parties except his own
BSPP, which unenthusiastic soldiers and civil servants dutifully
join to avoid prejudicing their careers.
Nearly all the Opposition leaders, victims of this one-party
system, are under arrest. All important newspapers have
been either closed down, nationalised or brought under Army
control. Trade unions are being replaced with “People's
Workers’ Councils”.
Trade has been nationalised, industry is almost entirely in
Government hands. Shopkeepers have been thrown out of
business as the "People’s Stores Corporation’’ has taken over —
with creaking bureaucratic inefficiency—nearly all wholesale
and retail distribution.
All the banks have long since become “People's banks”.
Burma's vocabulary of pseudo-Marxist jargon and her head-
long, sometimes stumbling, rush down a parallel lane to Com-
munism inevitably arouse suspicions that General Ne Win’s
sympathies lie with the Communist camp—except that parallel
lanes never meet. \
The Burmese explain that they closed the much-used libraries
of the British Council last year because otherwise they would
have had to allow the Chinese to open “cultural centres” in
Burma in order to preserve Rangoon's policy of strict neutra-
lity. It was at least a contributory reason. For behind the
fixed smile that Rangoon forever turns towards Peking, the
teeth are often tightly clenched.
The Burmese, sharing a long, wild frontier with their for-
From DENNIS BLOODWORTH
midable Communist neighbors, go through the motions of
expedient friendship with measured grace. But their con-
cealed emotions are a mixture of respect, anxiety, fear and
sometimes fleetingly betrayed anger.
The Chinese do not bother to show General Ne Win the
exquisite tact they reserve for targets like Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the Cambodian Head of State, it seems. At least
twice in the past few months Chou En-lai, the Chinese Prime
Minister, and Marshal Chen Yi, the Foreign Minister, have
dropped into Rangoon after giving the scantiest of last-minute
notice. And General Ne Win has not been amused by this
somewhat seignorial treatment.
The Burmese have above all been outraged by Peking’s
open support for the “white flag” Burma Communist Party,
whose armed insurgents are fighting against Rangoon forces
in alliance with Left-wing Karen rebels north of Rangoon.
The “white flag” political leaders plot from the Chinese
capital, and on the occasion of China's national day last
autumn Peking broadcast in Burmese and English the complete
1000-word text of a bellicose anniversary message from this
group.
This tirade, which was also published in the official
“People’s Daily” next day, described the Rangoon Govern-
ment as “imperialist” and “revisionist” and added threateningly:
“The Communist Party will strive for the
establishment of a new Burma of real
independence politically and economi-
cally.”
The Burmese were furious, and the
Army-controlled “Guardian” of Rangoon
ran a carefully restrained comment that nevertheless glittered
with half-hidden resentment.
Meticulously neutral, General Ne Win and his advisers are
strong supporters of the United Nations. They frown on
China’s bitter denunciations of the world body as “an imperial-
ist tool”, and they rebuffed Peking’s attempts to persuade
Burma not to approve the partial nuclear test ban treaty.
General Ne Win rejects the aggressive Sino-Indonesian con-
cept of a divided world in which “new emerging forces” must
struggle relentlessly against the “old-established forces” of
the West.
Antara, the official Indonesian news agency, has referred
sarcastically to Burma's “isolationist policy”, for Rangoon
does not support Djakarta's “confrontation” of Malaysia. The
first American bombings in North Vietnam were simply
reported as straight news in the Burmese Press.
General Ne Win is not like President Sukarno. He has
personal control of his own armed forces and does not have
to pander to a swollen Communist Party. In Rangoon Com-
munism has been officially denounced as “vulgar materialism”,
and Brigadier Tin Pe, General Ne Win’s “progressive” senior
Minister, has said that the main Government offensive is
directed against the Communist rebels, who are the chief
source of internal strife.
If he could, Ne Win would conduct his experiments in
Socialist revolution sealed off, like some hermit alchemist,
from the troublesome outside world. Most diplomatic
observers believe the West should be content that he is
nobody’s puppet and nobody's dupe, (ofns)


Dinner with Mao
“Most Chinese are satisfactory ”
From STANLEY KARNOW in Hong Kong
No world figure is more isolated and
insulated from the international
community than Mao Tse-tung,
71-year-old leader of Red China. Re-
cently a group of prominent French
officials, visiting China, were favored
with a rare opportunity. They were
invited to dine with Mao at his comfort-
able retreat at Hangchow, not far from
Shanghai, on the China coast. In three
hours of what he called a “strictly pri-
vate” conversation, Mao chain-smoked
and rambled over a wide range of sub-
jects. I was able to obtain a verbatim
account of his monologue, from which
I have extracted passages on Vietnam,
China's relations with Russia and India,
and China's attitude to the United States.
“It was stipulated in the Geneva Ac-
cords of 1954,” said Mao, “that there be
general elections in Vietnam to solve the
question of unification. At that time,
North Vietnam withdrew its troops,
which had fought the French. Then the
French left Vietnam, and the Americans
replaced them. The Americans taught
(the late President) Diem to massacre the
South Vietnamese Communists. Many
were killed, and the inhabitants rose in
armed struggle.” A French official said
that France favored “a peaceful solution
based on neutralisation” in Vietnam.
“Well spoken.” said Mao. “Your words
are powerful . . . France has had experi-
ence of fighting in that region. If the
US continues fighting, they too will face
another Dien Bien Phu. The Americans
have not had your experience, but they
refuse to heed your advice.”
“Is a peaceful solution possible in.
Vietnam?” asked another French guest.
Mao: “There will not be a rapid solu-
tion to that crisis. We must await the
day when the US finds it necessary to
withdraw ... It is necessary to keep
fighting until the Americans no longer
.wish to fight. But if they want to
continue fighting, what else is there to
do? It would be good to convene a
14-nation conference tomorrow. But the
US opposes that. Nor is our comrade,
the Soviet Union, actively in favor
either. Besides, the * South Vietnam
Government is in total disorder. That
disorder will continue until Vietnam is
unified. The different parties within the
South Vietnamese regime are not Com-
munist, so do not blame us for their
disarray.”
Turning to the Sino-Indian border dis-
pute, Mao claimed that he was willing
to discuss a settlement. But, he con-
tended, the Indians had posed impossible
pre-conditions to talks. For example,
the Chinese hold seven “civilian posts”
in the western Ladakh sector. “The In-
dians insist that these seven posts be
evacuated, ’ said Mao, “but we will not
withdraw a single post. Thus the In-
dians say negotiation is not possible. . . .
We continue our quarrel through diplo-
matic notes, and there is not much to
expect for some time to come. We are
not in a hurry. We are prepared to
wait. . . . The region south of -the so-
called MacMahon Line involves 90,000
square kilometres. You see, there was
a certain Mr MacMahon, an English
gentleman, who one day drew a border,
but former Chinese Governments never
recognised that border, and the present
Chinese Government does not recognise
it either.”
On the subject of borders, Mao
acknowledged that a more important
territorial issue covering 1,500,000
square kilometres exists between Red
China and the Soviet Union. “In the
past,” he explained, “there were unequal
treaties that obliged China to cede this
territory. China was forced to accept
them. There are similar problems in
the West border problems with Ru-
mania, Poland and Finland. Comrade
Khrushchev was prone to interfere in the
affairs of others. He asked why China
did not retrieve Hong Kong and Macao.
I answered: ‘You have more serious prob-
lems than Hong Kong and Macao. . . ”
Asked about ideological differences be-
tween Peking and Moscow, Mao side-
stepped, saying: “We shouldn’t put too
much stress on that question.” Instead,
he shifted to talk of Communist China’s
domestic affairs, concentrating briefly on
an issue that preoccupies him more than
any other —the younger generation.
“The old must educate the young,”
he said. “The young must learn from the
example of older workers and peasants.
Most company commanders in the army
have combat experience. But after a
period of peace there will be fewer who
have had that experience. In the face
of enemy attack, youths will have the
chance to acquire experience.” He con-
firmed that younger Chinese, lacking a
first-hand knowledge of revolution and
war, may not measure up to the quality
of their predecessors. “They have not
known war. They have not known rich
peasants and landlords. They have not
known combat. They must learn to
struggle. Perhaps they will learn. . . .
But most Chinese are satisfactory. A
percentage of them do not favor
socialism. They are the children of land-
lords and rich peasants. Their class in-
terests have been compromised. That
is quite natural and not dangerous. Of
100 youths, there are only a few like
that, and they cause no harm.”
Mao touched briefly on China’s econo-
my: “We have less experience than you
in economic planning. We lack suf-
ficient experience, especially for building
a socialist economy. There is no plan at
present. We are currently preparing one.
In the past, our method of planning was
not correct. We borrowed from abroad.
We still have much to put in order. . . .
Returning to international questions,
Mao referred to “World Powers who have
much atomic armament, yet speak of
peace”— obviously meaning the US and
the Soviet Union. “We cannot be intimi-
dated,” he declared. “We have never let
ourselves be intimidated by the threats
of those so-called great Powers, even
when we were weak. We very much
appreciate the policy of independence
currently pursued by France —not to
dance to the tune of a few Powers.
Those Powers say such-and-such, and the
others follow. . . . The world is changing.
This is not a world that one or two
Powers can control. Each people must
be responsible for the management of its
own affairs. The old, imperialist coun-
tries no longer have any right to inter-
vene.
“You will say that we have also inter-
vened in South-East Asia. That is false.
Until now, we have intervened with
empty words to encourage and support
guerrilla war. That is no secret. It is
completely public. Wherever there are
guerrilla wars in the world, we support
them. Our aim is to oppose US im-
perialism and other oppressors. We do
not camouflage that.” About the future,
Mao predicted that “conflicts will become
aggravated. If so, that won't be very
bad. They will spark the flames of the
South-East Asian peoples against US im-
perialism. After that, the struggle will
be directed against Britain, which is
manoeuvring to create the so-called
Greater Malaysia.” As the talks ended, a
French official asked: “Would you
authorise me to show the essence of this
conversation to President de Gaulle?”
“Of course,” said Mao. (ofns)

A N.S.W. Liberal Government will amend the
Obscene and Indecent Publications Act.
The N.S.W. Liberal leader, Mr. Askin, has pledged his party to
amend this Act so that a defendant will have the choice between
trial by magistrate or jury. A Liberal Government would also
set up a tribunal to which a publisher or bookseller could apply
for determination of whether a publication is obscene or
indecent without having to run the risk of a prosecution.
A N.S.W. Liberal Government will set up
a full time Law Reform Commission.
The Commission will have its own research staff and draftsmen.
Its task will be to initiate law reform and report on draft
legislation. One of its most important functions will be to
recommend reforms that will provide speedier and less
costly justice, particularly in third party insurance cases. It will
also concern itself with finding ways of allowing rights of
appeal for individuals who have been harshly treated by
administrative action. It will report on the desirability of
appointing an ombudsman.
A N.S.W. Liberal Government will compensate
the victims of crime.
A Liberal Government will set up a fund for payment of
compensation to innocent victims of crimes. Another fund will
be established out of penalties collected in criminal
proceedings from which the costs of an acquitted person
may be paid at the discretion of the court.
These are only three of the many reforms
a Liberal Government will introduce in N.S.W.
The Liberal Party is pledged to a wholesale policy of reform
in New South Wales. These reforms—combined with splendidly
practical proposals for education, transport, housing and
other bread-and-butter matters—are the reasons why this time
the swing is to the Liberals all over New South Wales.

Johnson v.
the Klan
The South’s night mind
From MURRAY KEMPTON
in New York
President Johnson went to tele-
vision to announce that the whole
weight of the Federal establishment
would be brought to crush the Ku Klux
KlanL He spoke with the rage and
horror of a President who had gone
through the uneasy week of the Alabama
Freedom March, had thought its conclu-
sion peacefully brought off, and then
waked up to learn that a white woman
from Detroit had been murdered in the
night driving back to Selma. J. Edgar
Hoover had done wonders; within twenty-
four hours his agents had arrested four
Klan members from Birmingham and
charged them, according to the genteel
formula which represents the limit of
Federal power in these cases, with con-
spiring to deprive their victim of her
civil rights. We have, as usual, no
reason for confidence that these men,
guilty or not, will ever be punished. The
situation which confronts the most
powerful nation on earth in its own
country is no better than this:
1. Mr Hoover has plainly done a
remarkable job of infiltrating the Klan.
The extent of his intimacy with its pro-
jects was indicated the week before last
when six bombs were planted in Bir-
mingham and found and defused before
they could go off. The official Southern
view was that these explosives were
planted by Negroes, who then “dis-
covered” them to embarrass the good
people of Alabama. But it seems obvi-
ous that the good people of Alabama are
quite capable of embarrassing themselves
without assistance from Negro conspira-
cies, and Birmingham has for five years
now rocked with explosions set off in
Negro neighborhoods by parties who by
now could hardly have failed of
arrest and conviction by the local
authorities had they been Negroes. The
assumption has to be that Mr Hoover
knew and moved.
2. The ease of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation’s penetration of the Ala-
bama Klans is a tribute to Mr Hoover’s
efficiency, but it is even more a mark of
the immunity the Klan enjoys. There
is very little need to conceal conspiracies
whose fruition will go unpunished. It is
impossible not to believe that law en-
forcement agents in many Alabama
towns know what the Klan is doing and,
in many cases, approve it. Last summer,
the FBI arrested the Sheriff of Neshoba
County, Miss., his chief deputy and
eleven members of the Philadelphia,
Miss., Klan for the murder of three
civil rights workers; the burden of the
evidence was that the sheriff had handed
his prisoners over to the Klan for dispo-
sal. All these men are now free; the State
of Mississippi is elaborately uninterested
in the Federal case against them; it seems
unlikely that they will ever be tried. No
Southern jury has yet convicted a white
man for a murder founded in the pas-
sions of resistance to the Negro revolt.
Every nation is familiar with the crimi-
nal who does not know he is a criminal;
what we face here is a society which
does not think him a criminal either.
3. President Johnson is challenging
what is at bottom a system for enforcing
local custom. It is an extremely effec-
tive system. Since last summer, there
have been five conspicuous cases of mur-
der by private citizens of persons en-
gaged in civil rights activities in Ala-
bama and Mississippi. Four of the five
victims have been white people. The
effect of this sort of thing on the indi-
genous Negro is immense. He has done
prodigies by himself; but the interest of
white Northerners has been an impor-
tant contribution to his self-confidence
and to his sense of community. The
mere face and presence of white allies
has been for him a proof that his loneli-
ness can be ended and his weakness for-
tified. He comes from a society where
white is strong and black is weak. A
Birmingham Negro lives where white
men stand forth as invulnerable. His
white ally came bringing that talisman
with him. Now the Klan is killing white
people; even color is no defence for the
man who chooses this side. It is hard
to believe that the Negroes who live
there can struggle on unimpressed and
undiscouraged by this example of the
awful power against them; events sur-
prise us with the extraordinary number
of them who do; even so, the ordinary
Negro has to grow more diffident when
a white activist is murdered than when a

Negro is. So the' Klan is a useful ad-
junct to that branch of law enforcement
which enforces custom.
4. The Klan, then, is the night mind of
the official South. It is doing, for ex-
ample, what Governor Wallace promised
the people of Alabama he would do if
elected, which would be to resist to the
ultimate means. Governor Wallace can-
not go quite that far and remain part
of the social fabric; but, if he does not
sympathise with the Klan impulse, he
clearly understands it. He has never
surrendered yet without declaring that
the tyrant's heel is upon his shore; the
Klansmen are, after all, acting as the
American tradition advises free men to
act under tyranny. When a governor
says that he has bowed to dictatorship,
he is a quisling if he brings any passion
to the suppression of the underground.
5. I had not before expected to look
back with nostalgia on the Goldwater
experiment; but it could be argued that,
while it was running its course, a number
of ugly impulses were appeased by the
illusion that a man who seemed to
respond to them might come constitu-
tionally to power. But Goldwater’s de-
feat meant to many Americans the end
of any hope that America could be
saved by its voters and it drove them into
forms of struggle outside the constitu-
tional system.
The membership of the John Birch
Society has, since November, been
doubled by an influx of persons now
convinced that Communism is in full
command and no longer possible to de-
feat at the ballot box. The Klan may
have done almost as well with South-
erners alienated by the passage of the
Civil Rights Bill and its ratification by
Mr Johnson’s re-election. The President
has overcome every defected politician;
but now he confronts something harder
to engage, the alienated citizen. The
Klan does what it chooses, inaccessible
to preachment, almost invulnerable to
punishment.
The North is indignant now; but there
is no assurance that, as things now stand,
it will always be. There are premiums
for success; if the Klan can murder and
go unpunished, ordinary citizens will
have to wonder after a while whether
any system which can convince so many
juries can entirely lack merit and
whether any government which suffers
so many failures can satisfactorily pos-
sess dignity. What is legal is likely with
time to be accepted. The President, at
the end, could only suggest that the
House Committee on Un-American Acti-
vities investigate the Klan. We go on,
so much wanting to believe that what-
ever is evil is alien. And that desire is
understandable to anyone who has
learned how entirely and uniquely native
this thing is; any innocence is to be
preferred t<? such knowledge.
Verwoerd’s
Stampede
“Look at the Congo ”
From a Correspondent
Long hours of radio propaganda have
clearly taken their toll of the Bri-
tish immigrants’ minds, as indeed
they have of the minds of nearly all
white South Africans, including, as the
recent provincial elections have shown,
those of the habitual English supporters
of the United Party—the party of the
late Field-Marshal Smuts. The stampede
to the Right into Dr Verwoerd’s laager
is probably the Government's most sig-
nificant political breakthrough since it
came to power 17 years ago. The daily
litany over the air of disasters in other
lands —strikes, riots, changing govern-
ments and military coups, are inter-
spersed with reports of balm and pros-
perity at home; insults to the white man
in black countries are reported in full
detail. And over all hovers the innuendo
that it cannot happen here.
Sunshine and servants are the final
seducers for white privilege. The bore-
dom of evenings without television, and
South Africa’s puritan Sundays without
cinemas and public houses, seems little
to pay for their elevation to the Repub-
lic’s elite; the white man boss.
Of the 40,865 settlers who came last
year, more than half are British; over
12,000 from the United Kingdom and
nearly 13,000 from Rhodesia and Zam-
bia, these hoping to find again in South
Africa the white man’s privileges now
ended in those countries. Only about
one per cent of the Republic’s recent
immigrant intake from Britain have
returned home.
Dr Verwoerd has reason to be pleased
with his new flock, despite the fear of
his Nationalist Press that too many
English-speaking immigrants would add
strength to the Opposition numbers.
Nothing could be further from the facts.
Afrikaans classes for the newcomers are
three-quarters filled with eager English-
speaking men and women, learning such
homespun phrases as “this is coffee”,
along with “this is propaganda” and “the
opponent is a rebel”.
A random group gathered in a coffee
bar after such a class produced some
frank comments which, to judge by the
letters to the Press, seem to represent
immigrant opinion as well.
A sales manager declared “I’m for the
white man, and when I get the vote I’ll
vote for Verwoerd. My wife feels the
same way as I do. And anyhow, the
native is better off here than anywhere in
Africa. . . .”
Someone challenged that: “But let’s be
honest. Apartheid is immoral, and we’re
not behaving like Christians, but if the
Nationalists say to me, ‘vote for me’ and
the United Party (Opposition) says ‘vote
for me’, what’ll I do? I’ll vote for the
Nats. Why? Because I think Verwoerd
is the only man who can keep things as
they are.” The Congo was never far be-
hind this talk. “Look at the Congo . . .
give the blacks the vote and you’d have
the same mess here ... it would be
suicide.” (ofns)

AROUND MELBOURNE
Having Trouble in Low Joints
Concentration on cartilages
T/'ictoria, like the other States, is
* suffering from one of the worst
droughts in memory. Our January-
March quarter was the driest for 50
years. As for Melbourne it was the
driest ever recorded with only 109 points.
There was brief respite with nearly an
inch over Passion Sunday weekend, but
frankly it wasn’t nearly enough.
Much has been written on what a
disaster this is to agriculture and the
financial distress of the farmers, but one
privation of the city has been overlooked
and it is beginning to reach alarming
proportion's.
What with the driest three months
ever known, our football grounds have
set like concrete. Hence the number of
injuries has been frightening. After
mid-week practice sessions one is almost
too alarmed to go out for the morning
paper. The casualty lists are reminiscent
of those of 1915. In “The Age” and
“The Sun” they are listed club by club
and frequently they cover two whole
pages.
This season we have had almost daily
medical bulletins on Ted Potter of Col-
lingwood’s strained groin, Polly Farmer’s
quinsy, David Shaw’s broken finger,
Shelton's injured ankle and we have fol-
lowed Ted Whitten's broken wrist right
up to the exciting stage last week when
they removed the plaster. Now we are
getting some jolly good stuff on his
finger movements. There have been
other side issues like Ray Gabellich's
appendicitis and we have even had some
interesting details on Brian Gray’s in-
fected toe.
But the most rewarding football medi-
cal reporting is on knees. So far the
list of knee injuries has been remark-
able . . . Jeff Bray, Noel Teasdale, Frank
Davis, Kevin Rose, Ken Timms, Hugh
Brommell; and Warren Roper of Col-
lingwood and Doug Wade of Geelong,
the great full forward, have both had
cartilage operations.
Australian Rules footballers suffer so
much from knee injury because they are
so vulnerable. When a footballer is
several feet up in the air, arms up-
stretched for a mark, it is so easy to
flatten him, and coming down at a crazy
angle, he twists his knee. In recent
years the biggest knee stories in Victorian
football have been John Coleman, Brian
Gleeson, Bob McLure, Polly Farmer,
Bill Stephenson and now Doug Wade.
Some trainers claim that 90 per cent
of all players eventually retire through
some form of knee injury: a point that
has always received far too little publi-
city. We have an Anti-Cancer Council,
but no Anti-cartilage Council. Not
enough research is going into the pro-
blem and maybe it is time the University
of Melbourne thought of a Chair of
Cartiology. This is not getting things
out of proportion. Polly Farmer’s knee,
was perhaps, the biggest Victorian news
story of 1962. It was photographed
repeatedly. We followed his cartilage
through all its stresses and strains until
at season’s end it was removed.
It was here that the State Museum
jnissed an opportunity. Mr Farmer's
cartilage could have been put on display
for all time like Phar Lap’s heart in
Canberra.
Now when the good Lord designed the
knee apparently he did not have in mind
Australian Rules. The knee is not an effi-
cient joint. The end of the tibia is like a
flat plate, the end of the femur is more
like a bunched fist and all that holds
them together are ligaments and muscle.
The cartilage is a piece of tough gristle
shaped like a new moon and 4in. long
and fin. wide. It acts as a washer be-
tween the joints.
Unless you are like Polly Farmer
every knee has two of them—the medial
and the lateral. Upon injury it becomes
like a loose cog. The cartilage can be
removed but the greatest danger of all
is torn ligaments. Unless treated within
the first week that injury can become
permanent.
Some surgeons have suggested eagerly
that all footballers should have their
cartilages removed at 17. Indeed, in
big-time European soccer if you are
paying £50,000-odd for a player and
there’s a suggestion of a knee injury,
you insist on buying him cartilage-free as
part of the contract. Then there are
those specialists who say that the carti-
lage is getting smaller and smaller, so
perhaps the VFL is really in a good
position. In another 1000 years the car-
tilage will disappear altogether.
Oh, so you’re wondering how a non-
expert can acquire such vast medical
knowledge. It’s simple. Victorian
medical football reporting is very sophis-
ticated. Within a few weeks anyone can
gain a course in practical medicine. But
do keep an eye on the cartilage news.
It remains the most tiresome, the most
talked about of all injuries. It is as
disastrous to the footballer as the fragile
sesamoid bone is to the racehorse.
Except, of course, racehorse owners
solve their problems with a far greater
simplicity. As soon as a racehorse breaks
his sesamoid bone they take him out and
shoot him.

Pioneers of the
“Big Country"...
Australian Owned—Australia Wide
Vol. 2. No. 2
April, 1965
Western Australia, comprising one-third of Australia's total area,
carries only 7% of our population. In one million square miles
live three-quarters of a million people, half of them gathered together
in the capital city, Perth; one person to three-square-miles . . .
“Big Country" indeed.
The major explorations of Australia had been completed by the end of the
1860's, but today, despite the closer settlement of so many areas of
Australia, pioneering still goes on in the West. Vast mineral wealth
is being discovered in the north-west—an atomic age tracking station
is rising on the coast not far away and agricultural pioneering is
being undertaken in the south at Esperance Downs. This remote area
lies four hundred miles from Perth on the Great Australian Bight. To
the east lies 1,000 miles of desert across the Nullarbor Plain.
Esperance Downs was first settled in 1865, but was generally regarded
as a hopeless area for major development. But now, through modern
science and the pioneering spirit, Esperance is a thriving community;
the land produces record grain crops and carries 3\ dry sheep to the
acre; a £1.5 million shipping berth is nearing completion, along with
a £100,000 abattoir. A new superphosphate manufacturing plant is
producing local requirements from rock phosphate shipped from Christmas
Island, Nauru and Ocean Island and sulphur from the United States,
Canada and Mexico.
Progress in a remote area involves transportation services.
Brambles Western Australian associate company, Frank Manford Pty. Ltd.,
has played an important role during the past thirty years
in the development of Esperance Downs. Man ford's as an adjunct to their
comprehensive services, are the official superphosphate carters and
spreaders for the Esperance area and in addition have carried hundreds
of tons of steel and wooden piling for the construction of the new
wharf and other projects. They also supply the area with seasonal
grain and wool transportation.

Perth and Fremantle are thriving cities and modern buildings and
facilities are constantly under construction. Perth is being shaped into
what may one day be one of Australia’s largest cities. Brambles is

BOUND FOR TASMANIA
When the Empress of Australia left on her maiden voyage to Tasmania
on January 16 she carried a consignment of Lysaght steel as part of her
cargo. The above photograph shows one of Bramble’s trucks I eaving
Springhill with a 14-ton load of 26 gauge Red Orb sheets. Another truck
with a similar load made the trip to Hobart. The steel was consigned to
John Lysaght (Australia) Ltd., Hobart, for re-packing and distribution to
local Hobart customers.
An army moves on its...
... confidence in Brambles
The big guns of Fort Scratchley, overlooking the
approaches to Newcastle Harbour, are to become monu-
ments on “The Hill,” near the Obelisk and King Edward
Park. The historic guns will rest in an equally historic
setting. From “The Hill,” the news of approaching sail-
ing ships brought the early settlers of Newcastle to the
docks, eager for news from England.
With advice from Brambles and the army, the Council
of the City of Newcastle undertook the move using our
heavy-duty vehicles. Each gun weighed nearly 20 tons.
Some small packages are heavy!
The load of machinery in this picture is dwarfed by the size
of the road rig needed to transport it. But size can be
deceiving! Brambles Industrial Services, Port Kembla, needed
their biggest transporter to carry this 95-ton cargo of machinery
from the side of the Japanese freighter KANTO MARU to the
Springhill works of John Lysaght (Australia) Pty. Limited.
The total consignment of machinery was 300 tons for a new
coil temper mill. Two mill housings each weighed 95 tons.
From the picture it looks as though a lot of wheels are needed
to move 95 tons, but they are all required for even distribution

Brambles Industrial Services hauled other sections of the mill

12 feet wide and 6 feet high. Each girder weighed 60 tons.

THE HUNTER
Units of Nicholls Crane Services,

at Port Adelaide.
The Glenmorry is a hunter—the modern

THE HUNTED
The skeleton of a whale, a victim of the harpoon,
posed an interesting problem for Nicholls Crane
Service, when it had to be moved to a new

Ten thousand pints of full cream milk were

milk for loading aboard the ‘"Orcades.”
The 10,000 pints of milk which will be made
up from the milk powder will help the

Letters to the Editor
“Is the C. of E. in a Mess?”
[THE BULLETIN has received a large
number of letters commenting on Patrick
Tennison’s article (B., March 27), and we
publish a selection below.]
SIR.—Patrick Tennison blatantly criti-
cises Victoria’s Church of England
Public Schools for their seemingly non-
existent recruiting of candidates for
Holy Orders. He boldly states that old
boys from Melbourne Grammar School
to date in the Church have totalled
a whole ten. This is drastically wrong.
During the past 100 years, no less than
105 old Melburnians have been ordained
as deacons in the Church. Eight of
these have served in the ministry of
other denominations.
I. Creber
Ehvood (Vic.).
SIR. —Archbishop Gough’s confession of
“living behind the times” obviously
gives the basic reason for the mess
in which the C of E finds itself on
the arrival of the critical Dr Ramsey.
Living in the blind piety of the colonial
fundamentalist orthodoxy, the Austra-
lian Anglicans (and not they alone!) have
stuck in the fossilised, reverent attitudes
which make it impossible to attempt a
critical appraisal of the original meanings
of the Bible without incurring shocked
accusations of “heresy” or “atheism”! No
wonder that Dr Ramsey found here a
“wretched, narrow-minded, out-of-date
partisanship”. For example, the parochial
ABC parsons in the radio-TV pulpits
show no inkling of the contemporary
theological debates and Biblical scholar-
ship which had already penetrated the
public mind through the cheap paper-
backs.
It is exactly this modern knowledge
that has seeped past the parochial clergy
into the general public that explains why
“the people have lost touch with religion
and God” (Dr Ramsey). If you study
these paperbacks or, better, the modern
Peake’s “Commentary on the Bible”
(1962 edit.), to which Dr Ramsey contri-
buted the lead article, you realise what
the original Christianity was. It was the
worship of a West Semitic god, Yahweh
(alias Jehovah) of Israel, and the belief
in an “anointed” of Yahweh, called
Yehoshuah (Jesus the Christ). This
“anointed” was contradictorily worship-
ped as an incarnation of Yahweh himself
who visited Palestine in Jesus’ body, or
his eternal son, or an incarnation of the
Logos (Word), or a chief of angels (as
in the Revelation), or, finally, as a Jewish
prophet. No wonder, then, that foremost
theologians, outside Australia, have re-
jected both this absurdly composite Jesus
and the Father Yahweh of “up there or
out there” as myths.
But the root cause of the collapse of
religion nowadays is not so much atheism
as something more radical — the collapse
of the belief in “souls” migrating from
the rotting corpses to Heaven, Hell or
Purgatory. There is no more room
for the clerical profession of “getting
(non-existent) souls to (non-existent)
Heaven” in our scientific age.
Gregory S. Smelters
Manly (ASIC).
SIR.—Patrick Tennison wrote quite a
useful and interesting article. But he is
seriously astray in his nomenclature of
the Anglican Church overseas. The title
of the Anglican Church in the United
States is the PROTESTANT Episcopal
Church, with strong emphasis on the
word “Protestant”. (There is another
Episcopal Church in the States, the
Methodist Episcopal, numerically a much
larger body.) There is no “Church of the
Province of East Africa”. There is a body
called “The Church of the Province of
South Africa”, but, as this organisation
has scrapped the Prayer Book and
Thirty-Nine Articles, it can hardly claim
to be Anglican. The Church of England
in South Africa does, however, function
under its own bishops. And just why
does The Bulletin, which used to pride
itself on factual accuracy, consistently
refer to the Roman Catholic Church as
the “Catholic Church”? That it is the
Catholic Church is vehemently disputed
by Greek Orthodox, Anglicans, Luther-
ans, Methodists and Presbyterians, all of
which subscribe to and most of which use
in their worship the Nicene Creed. I
believe I am correct in saying that the
official title of the Roman Communion is
the “Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic
Church”. Reunion is drawing much
closer. It is not, however, helped by mis-
statements of fact in the Press.
D. C. Tilghman
Berry (NSW).
SIR. —In your article “Is the C of E in
a Mess?”, the following references
appear: “They score because theologically
they are in a position of authority. They
demand! They are as bad in their way
as Rome ever was” . . . and “In their
traditional broad-mindedness, Anglicans
are generally warm to ecumenical ideas
— as long as they do not involve any
sort of takeover bid by the Pope . . .”
As it is desirable that Christians learn
to understand each other, may I ask since
when has the Pope made any bid to
take over any other Church?
The Catholic Church is open to who-
ever wishes to join it of his own free will,
knowing that joining such a Church en-
tails obedience to its teachings. I do not
call this a “demand”, rather do I feel
it is a “lead”, and what organisation or
country does not benefit from good,
sound leadership?
A. Lacey
Brisbane (Old).
SIR. —Patrick Tennison suggests that the
reason there has never been an Australian
Archbishop is because it is generally felt
that English clergy are better-trained than
Australians. This leads Englishmen to be
appointed as bishops of capital cities
whilst Australians are felt to be satis-
factory as assistants or bishops in country
dioceses. The record does not bear this
out. At present, the four English Arch-
bishops are all graduates of Cambridge.
In each case the degree is either a pass
BA (which is matured for a small pay-
ment into an MA) or a second or third
class degree with a change of tripos in
mid course.
On the other hand I notice, from
“Crockford”, that at least eight of the
Australian-born country bishops hold
either degrees from more than one uni-
versity, MA degrees which have been
won, or two degrees. The reason we go
on importing English Archbishops is
surely nothing to do with education.
Could it not be that English Archbishops
appoint Englishmen to senior posts who
see to it when elections take place that
fellow countrymen are appointed?
L. Watson
Strathfield (NSW).
SIR.—Mr Tennison implies that the
holding of a university diploma is all-
important. Yet he decries the value of
the Th.L and claims it is “not highly
regarded by our universities”, though he
admits that it is acceptable to the great
English universities. Surely this indicates
something very wrong in the attitude of
the Australian universities. I am afraid
it indicates an attitude of “snobbishness”
on the part of the universities, who adopt
a similar attitude to all diplomas and
degrees awarded extramurally.
Let us beware of attaching too much
importance to academic degrees.
Without doubt many members of the
clergy fail to a greater or lesser degree. I
have no doubt we would all admit to
having fallen far short of the high mark
of our calling. After all, 8.3 per cent of
our Lord’s own chosen disciples was a
complete failure and the remaining 91.7
per cent forsook their Master in His hour
of extremity and fled for their lives, but
the story does not end there. They re-
gained their faith and fulfilled their mis-
sion to go into all the world and preach
the gospel to every creature.
Rev. H. M. Maddock
Hobart (Tas.).
SIR.—Patrick Tennison records his
opinion that “to the outsider looking in
at Australian Anglicanism it would all
seem to be in a mess”. But he fails to
give an adequate picture of that Church.
For instance, he emphasises the nominal

Anglicans whose connection with their
Church is slight, but he doesn’t mention
the heroic Anglicans, the New Guinea
martyrs of 1942, priests and other mis-
sionaries, who remained with their flocks
in the face of the Japanese invader. He
writes, “the better the school, the poorer
its efforts in keeping the Church supplied
with ministers”. I cannot speak for any
other school but St Peter’s College, Ade-
laide. I do know that this school has
supplied no small number of priests and
is the “alma mater” of the Bishop of
Adelaide. Mr Tennison rightly points out
that the Episcopal Church in the USA
has a far higher proportion of priests
when compared with the Anglican
Church in Australia. He could also
have mentioned that Australian Angli-
cans send 600 missionaries to work in
Papua-New Guinea, among our Abori-
gines, and in the Pacific, Asia, Africa —
far more than their USA counterparts
provide.
In regard to nominal membership,
every large Church has its non-practising
adherents. No doubt the “High” and
“Low" parties puzzle many inquirers into
Anglicanism. More understanding of
these groups comes to the person who
recognises that both the “Catholic” and
“Evangelical” interpretation of Christian-
ity have their roots in the New Testa-
ment, where both the Sacraments and the
Word are equally emphasised. “Catholic”
and “Evangelical” are not antagonistic but
complementary. Also they are not verti-
cal but horizontal. Such parties exist not
only among Anglicans but also with
Methodists and Presbyterians. One can
see, too. varying emphases in the Church
of Rome.
If the C of E doesn't speak in the
loudest voice about drink and gambling
it is because she considers that a persis-
tent, wise teaching of positive temper-
ance is better than negative prohibition.
Finally, there are many Anglicans who
agree with Mr Tennison and your
editorial that the Anglican Church, and
every Christian Communion, should raise
the educational standards of its clergy
(and laity, too, I would add) in order to
keep pace with the advance in the edu-
cational standard of the Australian com-
munity. For Anglicans, a good augury is
the opening of a new St Barnabas’ College
in this State which will cater for
graduate students.

SIR.—I wish you could persuade your
contributors to check their facts when
they write about Geelong Grammar
School. Six weeks ago you published
some wholly misleading figures with re-
gard to Commonwealth Scholarships
which have never been corrected, and in
your issue of March 27 Patrick Tennison
states that Geelong Grammar School has
produced only two Anglican priests since
1938. That figure should be at least 26,
not including Presbyterian ministers nor
a number of medical missionaries.
T. R. Garnett
Headmaster, Geelong

Corio (Vic.).
SIR.—May an Anglican layman of some
50 years’ standing have a word to say
about the Church of England in Aus-
tralia and England? The apathy in the
Anglican ranks does not stem from a
surfeit of academic qualifications within
the clergy or from the lack of it.
Neither does it arise from divisions
in the form of worship. It is a direct
result of what the Church has been
teaching for the past 50 years. How
many of Christ’s Disciples were gradu-
ates of the universities of their day?
Probably not more than two. St Luke,
who was a physician, and St Paul,
but even St. Paul’s thinking had to be
forcibly redirected. Yet this small group
of men were able to fire the minds of
men and nations for two millenniums.
Why, then, are the present clergy failing
so miserably? The reason is that the Dis-
ciples taught the Bible as the word of
God, believing all that was written by
Moses and the Prophets. The Anglican
Church, for the past 50 years, has been
teaching that the Old Testament is NOT
the Word of God. They say it is only
legend, folklore, myth and bad history,
revealing, as it were, the groping of an
ignorant, simple people feeling their way
toward an appreciation and understand-
ing of God—in fact little more than a
collection of Hans Andersen’s Fairy
Tales. The Anglican Church today is
little more than a religious society, having
“a form of godliness” but without any
life in it since the authority of the Word
of God is no longer heard there. The
“Dishonest to God” opinions of men
have progressively displaced it.
R. K. Phillips
Campbell (ACT).
SIR.—As an Anglican priest, I read the
article with considerable interest. Some
of the criticisms made by Mr Tennison
I have myself made, though perhaps with
more moderation. When, however, I find
such a gross misstatement of facts as
Mr Tennison gives in regard to Anglican
and Methodist discussions at the annual
meeting of the Australian Council of
Churches in Sydney last month, I find
myself hesitant to accept his assertions
and judgments because, having revealed
himself to be so unreliable on one impor-
tant issue, he is obviously not a trust-
worthy reporter.
I was present at the Australian Council
of Churches’ annual meeting and partici-
pated in the Anglican discussions. There
was no “agreement between Anglicans
and Methodists to sign a covenant with
'a view to the two churches uniting”.
There was no “Anglican-Methodist pro-
jected link” either by way of “an ecu-
menical gesture” or otherwise. What hap-
pened was that Anglicans present at the
meeting met separately and agreed that
some target date for church unity must
now be considered, and accordingly re-
solved to take action within the Church
of England to seek to get their own
church to offer to enter into covenants
for unity with other churches. This was
of a general character and certainly not
directed towards the Methodist Church
in particular. At the same time, the
Methodists present at the meeting met
separately, and came to certain some-
what similar conclusions. In their case
also there was no special reference to the
Anglican Church.

. . . and Patrick Tennison replies
If readers Creber and Langford will
read my article again, they will find that
they have misquoted. I did not write
the things they attribute to me. My
apologies to Mr Garnett, if I misquoted
his school’s records. I was mis-informed
by an alleged Church authority. If
reader Tilgham rechecks he will find
that the Church of the Province of East
Africa came into being in 1962. If
reader Watson rechecks my article he
will see that I did not decry the value of
T.HL. I merely reported that Australian
universities do.

Am I a Jew?
Easter eggs at Passover
By DAVID MARTIN
You may say it is a curious question
to ask —Am I a Jew?—for nobody
but myself can answer it. Well,
don’t be surprised if I cannot answer it
with any certainty. I shall try, relying
as much as possible on my own spon-
taneous responses, but it is by no means
a simple matter. On the contrary, I find
it devilishly complicated and even painful
. . . sometimes 1 suspect two answers can
be given, a yes and a no.
Right away I see how difficult it is to
discuss this in an orderly way, as I would
like to do. Too many ambiguities, too
many contradictions of a general and
personal kind are involved which, I dare-
say, must be irritating to the reader.
Some people, I can imagine, will actually
be disgusted. After all a man ought to
know if he is a Jew or not! Does he feel
like one? Does he behave like one?
Does he consider himself named when
Jews are named? As to me, however:
I feel and I do not feel like one; I don’t
know too well how a Jew behaves and,
for that matter, I am no longer altogether
sure what a Jew is.
'■ I know little about my ancestors back
beyond a few generations, but there are
reasons to assume that they were as good
and orthodox Jews as the majority of
Hungarian Jews must have been once.
But there were conversions in my family
(for purely opportunistic reasons, I think)
some two or three generations ago. My
paternal grandfather “turned”—but some
of his children did not follow him.
Several of my aunts and uncles con-
tracted mixed marriages (and, for that
matter, so have I) and the rest of my
immediate kin were extremely assimi-
lated. My stepmother’s mother wore a
schaitel but my father was a twice-a-year
Jew; one of those who became Jews on
the Day of Atonement and at the New
Year, yet he would have answered the
question which I have posed for myself
with an unhesitating affirmative. Never-
theless he did not bother to have me
circumcised.
Why not? Probably because he naively
wanted me to make up my own mind at
the right time as to whether I was to be
a Jew or not. Yes, I vaguely remember
that at a certain moment he confronted
me with the question, to my great em-
barrassment. I was a Jew, you see, and
at the same time I did not think I could
give him or myself a clear reply. It
would have been easier had I had at my
disposal a serviceable definition of the
word “Jew”. But I have come to the
conclusion that such a definition does not
exist for thousands—perhaps millions —
who are called Jews or who call them-
selves Jews. There was a period when
I held that Judaism equated with the
Jewish religion, another, Zionist period,
when I equated it with the Jewish people
(or should I say “people”?), and a third
when I gave up the attempt to define the
thing at all because so many equally
valid or invalid answers were possible.
But none of this solves my own problem.
The sort of religion I was taught as
a child was meaningless. There were
Christmas trees and Easter eggs, but in
my thirteenth year I became a Barmitz-
wah lad. A poor, self-conscious rabbi
was supposed to give us instruction at
school, but the boys usually just argued
with him. I had no moral instruction
worth two hoots from any quarter that
I'm aware of: what morality I have I
had to make for myself, as much against,
as through, my parents or my teachers.
Yet, by and large, I know at least as
much about Judaism as does the general
run of my contemporaries: I know some-
thing of Jewish literature, a good deal
of Jewish lore. I cannot read the Shulhan
’Arukh but I think I know what it
teaches; I cannot give the Passover re-
sponses but I know what they are and
signify. I know the story of the Jewish
people people: the term slips in with-
out the least effort and I am often
proud of it.
Proud of it ... of what? The contri-
bution Jewry has made to the advance of
mankind? Of its power to survive? Of
its collective qualities, whatever they may
be? Do these things make one a Jew?
At bottom I hardly believe it.
Nothing could be more complex than
my attitude to Judaism as a religion, a
faith. Going back deep into my child-
hood I find that it frightened more than
comforted me. I am speaking of Jewish
ritual now, the atmosphere of the
synagogue, the tefillin and the prayer
shawl. Even of the letters of the Elebrew
alphabet, so dear and homely to my com-
rades, religious haluziin with whom I
went on hakhsharah near Budapest. What
can be frightening about Jewish ritual—
its Eastern-ness to a Westerner? But
normally the East does not scare me: I
feel quite at home in India. I think that
perhaps it has to do with the age, the
hoary antiqueness of Jewish observance.
A certain type of Hebrew decorative art
gives me the feeling that it confronts me
with Babylon and Assyria, with some-
thing old, cold and terrible, something
primeval; too fierce and masculine, lack-
ing the moon-god tenderness of later
culture and faiths. The Levite preaching
in the modern temple, the talles and the
black beard, the harsh cry of the ram’s
horn: I have felt a threat in this, a com-
mandment against which one must stop
one’s ears. I would feel the same at a
corroboree. No doubt there is a valid
psychological explanation, bound up with
the figure of the father. Try as you may,
you cannot separate childhood and sex,
childhood and religion. But to this day
the resistance survives, muted by know-
ledge and comprehension. I would not
think of seeking peace for reflection in
a synagogue; to me it seems the syna-
gogue has never been meant for this
purpose. It provides other things, to
those who know how to find them. Per-
haps it reminds me too forcefully of the
immutability of things.
And yet . . . The other day, in Hobart,
I persuaded a gentleman, a Jewish book-
maker, to open the beautiful old syna-
gogue for me. And what I saw delighted
me more than I can say. But perhaps it
was an aesthetic pleasure; I am not sure.
The figure of Christ as a teacher has
always attracted me, and I am glad to
think that what is specifically “Christian”
about him is an accretion of later history.
When I have time to regret these things
I regret the divisions of the Mosaic tree,
though I understand what has led to
them. A contradiction again: all my
being, all my traditions, all my creative-
ness “feels” across the gap that divides
Judaism from Christianity and would
mimimise or abolish it, but how can I


HELP
LEGACY
all the year
round
regret what I have written poems about,
namely the heroic past of the Jews? I
cling to what my reason tells me would
more happily be abandoned. Religion
can only mean an ethic to me, and what
is iife-affirming and vital in the Christian
ethic appeals to me strongly. As a writer
I am interested in symbols. I experience
the story of Christ as a sublime sado-
masochistic fantasy: the need to destroy
and the need of forgiveness for the
entirely unconquerable destructive urge.
Christianity gives greater freedom to the
feminine element in man. Still, while
I can accept Einstein's awe and reverence
face to face with the life force of the
universe, I am too much a child of my
time to accept the idea of a universal
creator, and far too much a Jew to accept
the idea of a god-man.
Jewish soccerf
T detest the ghetto and would break
A down its last walls, real and abstract.
Then why is it that I associate myself
with, of all things, a Jewish soccer club?
(There is only one Jew playing for the
club, well understood.) And why is it
that I, who have long ceased to be a
Zionist, read with a thrill of the deeds of
the army of Israel in the Sinai campaign
—a campaign which I hold to have been
misguided, not to say reactionary? I
have lived in many countries and I am
homesick for most of them: for Spain,
for India, for Scotland . . . But I am not
homesick for Israel where I worked in
a kibbutz of the Hashomer Hatzair. It
was in Israel more than anywhere else
that I doubted whether I was a Jew.
Israel seemed too small to me, too
narrow: and yet it is not narrow; no
more than any other land. I react like
Pavlov’s dog to the positive stimulus
of certain words. Palmach is such a
word. But, to be honest, I cannot
genuinely feel a sense of solidarity with
a man because he is a Jew, be he, say,
a Yemeni, a Kurd or a Russian.
This could be one of the penalties we
who spent our youth in Germany have
to pay, lost as we are in a peculiar
ambivalence. My attitude to Jewry is
simplicity itself compared to my attitude
to Germany and Germans. In the last
analysis my culture is German. I would
like to revisit Germany but have evaded
the opportunity. I long for the Baltic
coast and the German forest whose
gnomes and fairies inhabited my child-
hood, but they now belong to a night-
mare. Almost against my will I some-
times find myself saying that I am sorry
an atomic bomb did not wipe out the
German race. It is only in my dark
moments that I feel like this, when I
recall how many members of my family
perished under Hitler. Maybe if I could
straighten out my feelings about Germany
I could straighten out my feelings about
Jewry and Judaism. I am quite aware
that in this I can speak only for myself,
that it is not an emotion shared by many.
Can there be such a creature as a Jew
pretty well divorced from the Jewish
community? And by what name would
he go? 1 don’t care to be hemmed in by
kosher restaurants, Jewish bookshops
and youth clubs. I wish my son to be
free of all this, yet I want him to re-
member that he is a Jew, that he can
claim some remote’ kinship with Bar
Kochba and Einstein. Were he to com-
plain that his father has left a void In
his life where the Jew should be, I would
have to answer that I cannot give him
what I do not have: an unsatisfactory but,
I think, an honest answer. It appears
that Judaism is not something to which
one may lay claim by right of loving
acquaintance alone, as we may lay
claim to most of the beauties and virtues
of life. At the same time —I wonder if
you will follow me in this?—l think one
should want to be what, in one sense or
another, one is. Then it would seem I
am rebelling because the choice is not
absolutely free and, voluntary. I have
always had trouble in accepting what I
could not freely choose. This, too, leads
back into childhood.
Conflict of two prides
T know that these are all highly un-
A original attitudes and reactions. It
is not a bewilderment unique to me, I
merely experience it in a particularly
sharp and conscious form. When I
seek an end to the wearisome wandering
of the wandering Jew I seek an end
to some of my own tramping, but when
I read that, unless the Jewish birth-rate
rises, Australian Jewry will disappear, I
am not made happy. I see no spiritual
virtue in suffering, and I would like
Jewish suffering to end. But if Jewry
ends, something precious will be lost,
I believe. Alas, I cannot square the
circle. Nowadays I no longer consider
that historical determinism supplies the
answer. The example of Soviet Jewry
and of Soviet anti-Semitism suggests that
it does not.
I think that if I had a say in the matter
I would have liked to be a Jew in the
age of Moorish Spain, and in no other,
the age of great poets and philosophers,
the age of rational enquiry. But that age
was followed by Torquemada. I would
have been too proud to become a
Maranno: I would have pulled up my
stakes and moved to Amsterdam or Ham-
burg. Yes, it is pride which makes me
say that I am a Jew; I will not give up
because the world wants me to give up.
A conflict of two prides, in a nutshell:
too proud to surrender under whatever
pressure, but too proud to accept what I
cannot accept completely voluntarily.
This is what I mean when I speak of a
painful conflict. Well freedom is the
recognition of necessity. But it is a law
which I can make to work for myself
only on an intellectual, not on an
emotional, level.
Non-Jewish elements touch my life far
more closely than Jewish elements, i do
not have even a faint remnant ot that
sense of strangeness which Jews some-
times feel in their dealings with the
Gentile environment. 1 can write with as
great or greater conviction about the
experiences of a Greek Orthodox girl in
Australia than of ? Jewish girl, and I
prefer doing so because it helps me to
avoid still sensitive areas of conscious-
ness I cannot trust myself tc write about
Jewish family life; it could reveal certain
tensions too nakedly. But some say that
when I write about Greeks they recognise
a Jewish substance, and it may well be
true. As a journalist 1 have edited Jewish
newspapers without .any sense of falsely
pretending. But I did not enjoy being
involved in the machinations of the com-
munity, which are neither better nor
worse than those of any other group.
Voila! I am Jew enough to be more
irritated by Jewish shortcomings (which
probably are my own) than by others’.
As I write this I have to smile: how
wonderful, how easy it would all be if
all Jews were perfect! I say to myself
that I cannot have my cake and eat it.
If I claim some kinship with Einstein
and Bar Kochba, I must also acknow-
ledge kinship with Reb A. and Reb B.
who touch the darker places in what
passes for my soul.


... LAST VOYAGE HOME
A SHORT STORY BY CHARLES SRIBER
He slammed the front door, glower-
ed along the facade of the street,
accepted the friendly nod from
Mrs Crane in 24 with a grunt, dodged
round the little Palonni girl who was
playing hopscotch and stepped out down
the street towards the stairs that led to
the Hungry Mile.
The paper boy said, “ ’Evening, Mr
Svensen, which one?” handed him the
one he pointed to and reluctantly
handed over the change. To all of this
Sven Svenson was oblivious. He was
doing the things he did most Friday
nights.
Below, on the Mile, wharfies were
bustling along towards the street that led
to the city. Trucks speeding past halted
occasionally to let a few clamber onto
the rear. Friday, 5 p.m., and for them
—except the few called out for overtime
—the week was over. Tomorrow and
the next day was theirs to spend at
Randwick, the local, pottering around
the house or even at the theatre. Sven
looked and did not see them. He was
headed for the S.S. Ningen moored at
her usual berth along the long, wide
waterfront street. If he had considered it
there would be no rancour or envy of
anybody else. This was his weekend
routine. He was used to it. Nobody
forced him, he walked stolidly along,
his fat body waddling sideways, of his.
own volition. The weekend belonged to
the ship and the following Monday he
would return to enjoy two days at home
. . . unconsciously, his pace slowed. On
Monday, given good weather and average
tides, he would return and all of the time
from then on would be his. He glanced
back, before descending the steps, at the
Rocks where he had lived for ... it
must have been nearly forty years.
Two w'harfies brushed past him. One
said “Hello, Sven!” The other spat on
the ground. Sven saw nothing and con-
tinued on his way.
He was down on the pavement now,
paddling on with his great flat feet rush-
ing him as though to some desperate
mission. His belly wobbled above the
belt of his flannel trousers. The
evening was hot and he pushed his trilby
back and, with the back of his hand,
rubbed stinging sweat from his blue eyes.
The dark cavern of the wharf shed
engulfed him. No activity. Stillness.
The trucks departed. A smell of stale
horse dung, spices and sweet, sickly
sugar. Only the skipper was in evidence
aboard the Ningert. Leaning on the
wing of the bridge, he acknowledged his
arrival with a glance. Soon the rest of
the crew would clatter along the gang-
plank to- come aboard. Sailing was up
for 5.30. A chalked blackboard announ-
ced the fact. “Sailing for Newcastle and
North Coast ports. At 5.30”—a bare
ten minutes away. As so many times
before, they would come shuffling along
the wharf, flushed from the pubs. Only
this was the last time they would do it.
in the bare fo’c’sle, changing into work
clothes, Sven considered the recent his-
tory of the high-funnelled, ancient
steamer that had begun her life plough-
ing the Irish Sea and had sailed across
the seas and oceans years before.
For about two years r.ow cargoes had
been steadily shrinking. The writing on
the wall. Everyone knew it couldn't go
on. “Stop your obstructionist tactics!
Cease the endless demands and petty
stoppages!” the owners had suggested.
“We’ll grab what we can when we can.
She's set for the boneyard anyway!” the
men had replied. Time was against the
company and on their side.
The company had bowed to the inevi-
table and cargoes had diminished until
today when the ship had been loaded in
six hours with a pitiful heap of general
cargo that brought her down a scant two
foot six inches fore and aft.
Ugly she might be, but generally the
Ningen had been a happy ship. In her.
heyday she had sailed loaded to the
hatch combings with deck cargo lashed
bridge-high. After discharge at the main
river ports she loaded for the return
journey, sugar in season or timber when
the mills were idle.
Of course the sugar would still come
down to the Sydney refinery. Only at
both ends modern bulk loading and dis-
charging gear was ready for installation.
The general cargo would go by road and
that would effectively end the purpose of
the line.
He heard the men’s voices as they
come aboard. But neither the skipper
nor the mate said a word and, when the
mud pilot went up to the bridge, they
shoved the plank on to the wharf, hauled
in the lines for the last time and coiled
them below.
The shrill earsplitting whistle announ-
ced their turn into the channel, down-
stream towards the ocean. Singly, al-
most reluctantly, they filed forward to
get ready for their watches or turn in
for some shut-eye.
Sven stayed on deck and only when
Pinchgut came abeam did he turn and
shuffle into the fo’c’sle to sit on the
bench beside his bunk.
“No sleep, Sven?” “What, you got the
channels already?” “The trip ain’t started
yet and you’re ready to go ashore!” And
he just glowered at them and snorted and
said nothing. They were settling down
now, anxious for sleep and his wide eyes
looked into the gloom of the fo’c’sle,
ignoring the double row of bunks either
side, with the backless benches beside
them and the table riveted between the
hawse pipes that angled down to the
chain locker below.
Somewhere in the depths of his brain,
little pictures flashed back to uncorrela-
ted incidents of his past. He interpreted
them in English. He had thought in
that language for years. Norwegian
was relegated with the other jetsam one
dredged up to help pass a long trick at
the wheel when sleep plucked at a man’s
eyelids. How many years had gone by
since he sailed from Stavanger? Like
the Mad Pole, Paddy, Spanish Joe and
the rest of them, he was an Aussie now
and the future he allowed himself to con-
sider had a strictly local context.
He yawned and decided he should
turn in. By the time they got inside
Nobby’s and the watches were called


up to load the Newcastle cargo he’d be
stonkered. But he continued to sit there.
He supposed they’d have to move out
of the Rocks and that would be hard.
True he’d never been very neighborly,
drank usually alone or chatted to Blind
Joe in the Hero of Waterloo. But every-
body accepted that and no one inter-
fered with him. Rocks people didn’t
mind each other’s business unless some-
thing went wrong. The shack up at The
Entrance wasn't too bad. He’d fiddled
with it for years and it was fixed
up nice and comfy for him and the
missus. The kids would have to take off
on their own. Do them no harm. They
were old enough. No, he’d build this
new life up there. A fishing boat perhaps.
And there were the chooks. Not to be
relied on, but they’d laid pretty good so
far. They'd be all right. There was the
pension and the missus could whip up
a meal that tasted real good; out of
nothing, just about. He’d be all right.
Compared with most of them, who’d
pissed their money against the wall,
he was well off.
He frowned and wondered why, if
this were all so obvious, that storm cloud
was building up like a bloody great rain
squall above him. He rubbed his sisal
thatch, but it didn't go away and he
waited for it to break as all squalls must.
The Ningen was beginning to lift to
the swells that rolled in between the
Heads and the bunks creaked and the
anchor chain began to tumble around
and rattle in the steel bulkhead of the
locker beneath his feet. Why the hell
should anyone care about leaving this?
Yet he knew that above all else he didn’t
want the line to close down. He didn’t
want the Ningen to join the dead, listing
hulks that blistered in the harbor back-
waters, their rust-streaked funnels cov-
ered with tarpaulin shrouds to keep the
rain from flooding their dead fire-boxes.
She was a bastard of a ship, rolled
in a heavy dew, stuck her fo'c’sle head
deep into the green seas and her decks
were rust-pitted and the messroom ran
with cockroaches. Why, on the new
ships a man lived well, had a single
berth cabin to himself and tablecloths
and ate good with a peggy to wash the
dishes. The hell with the new ships!
For how many years had this been
his life? From the old windjammers, the
dirty, squat Atlantic barques and the
barquantines of the Baltic, and big-raked
passenger ships, and all the tramps and
Yankee schooners and tankers until he
had skinned out in Port Kembla and
made his way up to Sydney back after
the Great War. In those days the line
had run passenger ships. He’d signed
©n his first coast ship and the short runs
had suited him after the interminable,
gut-aching ocean voyages. Floating
whore houses they’d called those old
high-decked tubs with their varnished
woodwork and white deckhouses. They
hadn’t been so bad, even though a man
worked long hours, slept on a donkey’s
breakfast and overtime was unknown.
He grinned at the thought of it, and
didn’t notice the fireman opposite shoot
him a funny look. By God, they hadn’t
been so bad those passenger ships! A
blaze of lights along the decks as the
passengers trooped on to the wharves,
men shouting, women giggling and
getting their bottoms pinched as their
blokes chivvied them up the gangway.
Plenty of knowing winks had passed
among the sailors who lined the rails
sizing them up. So, it was a canoodling
jaunt. And what sailor ever objected to
a little canoodling? Svenska flicka can-
oodle bar —Norska flicka canoodla
better!” And he soon discovered
Aussie fhckas were not so dusty either
and many a one had found her way
forward to the fo'c’sle where they broke
out the beer and had a grand old time.
And wasn’t that how he’d met Norah
and married her?
The Ningen was turning up the coast
now, pitching and rolling in a slow
stirring motion, her handful of cargo
giving hardly any ballast. Sven took a
plug of tobacco from his pocket, sliced
a bit with his huge Finnish knife and
began chewing. Yes, life on the coasters
had suited him fine. They could keep
their Cape Horn trips and their winter
passages across the Western Ocean. A
few southerlies, or black nor’easters. But
you had to expect some bad weather to
make up for the good. That was the
way. of the sea. If the wind blew up
to 75 knots and you wallowed, decks
awash, at least it never lasted long and
a safe harbor was never far away.
All this was sliding astern in the wake
of the churning propeller. Other ships?
Yes, they might be all right. Only he
knew he could never walk aboard
another ship. Not that he was too old.
By God, he could show some of those
young buckos a few tricks aloft! Only
... he got to his feet, stepped to the
door and spat out a great brown gob
that the wind whisked away to seaward.
Stan, the mud pilot, came down from
the bridge, relieved by the watch. “What’s
the matter Sven? No sleep? Got the
channels?” Couldn’t they say any other
bloody thing? Only he kept silent. He
liked Stan. “Better turn in man. With
this southerly up our arse we’ll be abeam
of Nobby’s before you get on watch.”
Sven nodded, but made no move while
Stan stepped into the adjacent washroom
and took out his teeth to scrub them
before getting his head down.
“What you plan to do when we sign
off Stan?” he asked the mud pilot.
“Me?” Stan mopped his face with a
towel, carefully wrapped his teeth in a
handkerchief and slid them beneath his
pillow before replying. “Why, I’ll sign
on something else, of course. What do
you think I’d do? There’s plenty of ships
around.”
“Too bad the Ningen gotta lay up.
Maybe ...”
“She’s had it,” Stan cut in abruptly,
“you going to cry about a ship?”
“It’s just I got to know her I s’pose,”
Sven said.
“Oh, she’s been good to us,” the other
man conceded, stripping off his clothes
as he spoke, “short trips, plenty of over-
time, home regularly. A good steady
man’s ship.” He spoke as though anxious
to make it clear he had no hard feelings,
“but that ain't everything. Times is
changing. The union’s fighting for good
conditions. So long as you and me are
content to sail on rust buckets like this
one they’ll never come.”
“But that way we . . .” Sven suddenly
shut his trap tightly and began undoing
his belt ready to turn in.
“I’ll never miss the bastard,” Stan
growled the words as he climbed into
his bunk and stretched his long body
beneath the clothes, “leaky bloody deck-
head, water dripping in on you every
time the seas tear out the caulking,
sweaty hull plates, one big fo’c’sle, all in
together listening to every man’s guts
turning. Miss this? Not me mate.” He
pulled the curtain along the rail beside
his bunk and then suddenly pulled it
back and stuck out his head, toothless
lips working before he barked, “I’m no
bloody coast bull! You can take that
from me. It don’t worry me which ship
I sail on. Sixty milers, tankers, passenger
ships . . . they’re all the same to me.
I’m not married to this line, nor any
other miserable line.”
Sven muttered, “You mean ... not like
me?”
“I didn't say that. Don’t be a bloody
fool. What ship you sail on is your
business.” And the curtain was tugged
closed and the bunk light switched off.
But Sven continued to sit there like
a small boy reluctant to get into bed.
“Stan,” he called quietly. “It’d be hell
for me on the new ships. All them young
fellers . . .”
“Screw the young fellers,” Stan’s
voice came from the darkness, “who
knows how they’d stand up. They never
been tested. Today they’re all militants;
with their mouths. Comes trouble and
we’d see how they behaved.”
“They say the coast ships are homes
for the Andy Mac Nabs, Stan,” Sven per-
sisted, “but I bin as good a shipmate as
the rest of them, ain’t I?”
“You been all right.”
“I bought pamphlets, put in money
for Russian relief, for China; all that lot.
That’s what they want of a bloke, ain’t
it?”
There was a silence. “There’s a bit
mope, but you passed all right on that
too, leastways in my books and I’m as


good a union man as any of them.
Look, the past is dead and gone. Pull
your great ugly head in and go to sleep.”
But although he undressed and lay
down, Sven found he could not sleep
and when the watch called him out at
Newcastle to load the steel and wire
coils that lay on the darkened wharf,
he was still awake.
The trip north followed the pattern
of hundreds before. The weather was
mild and the sea calm. They rock-
hopped, pulled out to round Smoky
Cape, halted a few hours on the fishing
grounds, made good hauls, started the
engines again, crossed over the bar into
the river and discharged cargo at the
various jetties before coming back down-
stream and tying up at the sugar mill.
Loading went slowly. The crusher
was playing up and there was a shortage
of bags, work went at snail’s pace for
a while. Nobody cared. This was the
last trip. They drank beer in the little
pub outside the gates, fished a little and
yarned with the shore gang who were
cane cutters, mill hands or laborers
doubling as wharfies. It was the end for
them too. Already the new bulk loading
plant was an identifiable menace. When
it was erected and in action the need for
wharfies would cease.
They worked in the old style as they
had for years. Mill hands loaded the
flat topped trolley, the men trundled it
along the bent steel tracks to the edge
of the wharf where they loaded the
bags into defined sling loads.. The long
ship’s derrick swung over, picked up the
load and deposited the sling neatly at
the mouth of the chute that descended
into the hold. Unhooked, the hitch
loosened, the bags were dragged into
the chute to be released by a great
wooden trigger bar so that they cascaded
singly into the hold. Down in the hot
gloom of the hatch, the crew received
them and stacked them either side and
fore and aft to trim the ship.
Frenchy, as usual, was chute man.
He sat up on the hatch, hand on the
trigger, making sure the men below were
ready before releasing a bag. He was
liaison man between the sailors below
and the men on the wharf. A lithe,
gentle-voiced man, it was said of
Frenchy that when he first arrived myst-
eriously from Quebec, he could carry
a sugar bag under each arm and dance
a funny kind of jig at the same time.
That was before he got his hernia.
In the lulls between loading, the sea-
men lay prone on the bags.
“What you fellers goin’ to do when
she lay up?” Frenchy called down to
them.
And they all had an answer. Stan
was for the Fremantle run; plenty of
accumulated leave. Spanish Joe wanted
to sign on one of the big sugar ships
that ran up to Ingham and Townsville.
No dirty weather in the Bight for him.
The Mad Pole had had bloody Australia.
He was for an overseas ship and some
sheilas that had their own teeth. Paddy
wanted to get on the spud run; down
to Tassie . . . the ABC country!
“And what about you, Sven? What
you gonna do?”
And Sven had climbed to his feet as
though summoned to answer some
mighty authority who sat on high ready
to judge him on his reply.
“Me? I ... I ... By the Holy Christ,”
he stammered desperately, “I don’ know
what the hell I do.” And he stood
there, bandy legs astride, arms out in
supplication, his ham fist still clutching
his cargo hook.,
“No,” he shook his great square head,
“I don’ know, Frenchy. And that’s the
God’s honest truth.”
The rest of them stirred uneasily and
looked at him without speaking. Only
the Pole said, “How come you don't
know?” He asked the question with
vicious delight.
“I never bin on no other ships for
years. I wouldn’t fit in.” He turned
to them, “You know that boys.” And,
one by one, they changed their positions
and the relaxed ease went out of their
bodies.
“No, they don’t like scabs on big
ships,” the words were spoken and could
have come from any of the men seated
close together around the tumble of bags.
No one was sure who uttered them be-
cause at that moment a cry went up on
the wharf that a new load of sugar was
on its way and they rushed to get on
their feet and make a great fuss about
receiving it, all but one hoping that Sven
had not heard the words.
The rhythm was resumed and the
pace went easily.
Only Sven never stopped or spoke a
word. With an energy that belied his
sixty-odd years, he bent over the bags,
grunted as he lifted them in unison with
Stan, swung them neatly down to the
men waiting below and turned to bend
over the next bag as it tumbled out of
the chute. Stan growled at him to slow
down, but it went unheeded and for
once he made no issue of it. Never before
had he seen him bull it like this, yet he
knew better than to speak again. The
decisive movements had a drugging effect
and the men worked automatically
so that when Sven’s hook stuck, Stan
at first didn’t notice. His own had
slipped out easily and he stood, waiting
for the Norwegian to free his. Perhaps
it was too deeply embedded, or the
sugar had hardened, or a barb had
formed on the tip of the hook. What-
ever the cause, Sven couldn't wrench it
free. Such a thing happened frequently
enough. A man merely released his
hold, shouted a warning to the men
below in case the hook fell clear in
flight and waited for someone to pick
it up and pass it back so that work
continued. All he had to do was let go.
Only Sven didn’t let go and when
the bag tumbled down to the floor of
the hold, he fell with it in a double thud
and gasped out a curse in Norwegian.
For a second or so he lay like a
turtle stranded on the beach making
helpless gestures with his-arms and legs.
Spanish Joe seized one arm, the Mad
Pole grabbed beneath his other and
together they yanked him to his feet.
Savagely, he tore himself away from
them and stood swaying and glowering
wordlessly. He still held the hook
which had come clear, ignored their
questions as to whether he felt all right
and- turned and clambered up the wall
of bags to his position with Stan at the
foot of the chute.
“Hey, hold it!” Pat shouted, “that was
a bloody great fall you had.”
The Norwegian looked at the Irish-
man in severe silence and made no reply.
Instead he lifted his head to where
Frenchy crouched, anxiously peering into
the gloom of the darkened hold.
“Send down the bags! Send down
the bloody sugar!”
Sven bent once again over his work,
and never looked up until the bosun
stuck his head over the hatch combing
and yelled for them to come up for a
smokoh.
The men tossed down their hooks and
rushed for the ladder that led up to the
deck. No one noticed that Sven was
last. The incident had been forgotten.
No one saw the grimaces as he painfully
pulled himself up, a rung at a time.
When they missed him from the mess
room Stan went out on deck and found
him collapsed just forward of the hatch.
His hand still clutched the cargo hook.
The Ningen made its last voyage back
to Sydney without Sven Svensen.
He lay in the coast base hospital and
the nurses were kind and shook their
heads over how remarkable it was for a
man half way to seventy working on with
a slipped disc and a double hernia.
The doctors were professionally cheer-
ful. They’d have him up and about as
good as new. Indestructable, those Scan-
dinavians! Well, almost. He’d have to
give up the sea of course. But, then
for a man his age it was high time any-
way. No doubt he had a bit stowed
away for a rainy day? Careful people
these squareheads. Needed a bit of that
kind of spirit in Australia.
And Sven, strangely neat and still in
his loaned pyjamas, lay silently back and
looked at them all as though he had some-
thing he wanted to explain, but it would
be no good trying anyway. That was
the way it was, so what could he do?


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
A Question
of Conscience
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Melbourne painter Albert Tucker is
on his first visit to Sydney for 44
years. His visit coincides with his
exhibition the Dominion Galleries,
again the first for 44 years. Mr Tucker's
excursion north was heralded by a public
relations officer, perhaps standard equip-
ment for Melbourne artists, but some-
thing of an innovation in Sydney.
The public relations officer is Mr Cec
McKenzie, who is still recovering from
the excitements of organising the world
trip and promotion of the group of
Sydney men wffio “beat” the poker-mach-
ines. The full story, Mr McKenzie said,
hadn't yet been told. He hoped it would
be told in the book he had just been dis-
cussing with a Sydney publisher.
In the meantime, his firm felt it could
do something to rationalise art selling
in Australia, probably by welding in-
dividual galleries in different cities into
some sort of chain. “This is done over-
seas,” Mr McKenzie said, “so there seems
no reason why it should not work here.
At present, all the galleries seem to be
working against each other.” Mr Mc-
Kenzie said that some recent develop-
ments were tending to cut the private
galleries' slice of the art market. “For
instance,” he explained, “an architect
might get £40,000 for the art w'ork in a
big new building paintings, sculpture
and so on. But in many cases he bypasses
the private galleries and goes straight to
painters he knows.” Architects, Mr Mc-
Kenzie said, were tending to take on more
and more jobs. “They even do furniture
removals, you know, they move you from
your old building into the new one and
there’s another £IOOO on your bill,” he
said.
In the meantime, there was Mr Tucker,
who, Mr McKenzie pointed out, was
“one of the big ones, up there with
Nolan.”
Mr Tucker is, indeed, one of the big
ones, both in reputation and in the price
his paintings now fetch with ease, and
should need a minimum of Mr Mc-
Kenzie’s attentions.
He is an impressively bearded man
with a splendid flow of words. Although
firmly figurative as a painter, he has a
fondness for large abstractions which
seems typically Melbourne, and which,
consequently, Sydney people sometimes
find refreshing. Mr Tucker rather de-
plores this slicing Australia off into
regions. Of course, it is all right for
everyday matters, so long as it doesn't dis-
tract us from our contemplation of our-
selves as Australians.
Mr Tucker's largest and firmest ideas
are on this subject. But, then, he had
rather longer than most to think out these
ideas. Mr Tucker was away from Austra-
lia for 13 years from 1947.
“The years I lived overseas in big, cos-
mopolitan cities, such as New' York,
Paris. Frankfurt and London merely con-
vinced me that 1 can have no part of their
life,” he said. “This feeling of alienation
was as strong in America and England as
it was in Europe. There was always this
feeling at the back of my mind, ‘This is
not my problem. My work is not here.’
“The feeling I have now' towards my
W'ork and it is one I have felt for some
time is that it must be directed towards
the Australian conscience, in the sense of
responsibility to the Australian tradition.
We must think and w'ork as Australians,
in Australia, in the world. What I do pro-
test against is cosmopolitan, faceless,
anonymity and against art which is de-
regional and de-nationalised. We are a
particular people in particular circum-
stances. We are at this point in time, this
point in space.
“I feel that this Australian conscience
doesn't just relate to art, but to the whole
of our national life. Our very survival as
a nation is threatened. We are a fragment
of Europe dropped into the Pacific. We
are a completely displaced people.
“But the positive side of this is that
this displacement sets up a dynamic. This
applies to every Australian, navvy, jour-
nalist, singer or painter. Everything each
one of us does, even if it is only digging
trenches for sewerage pipes, should be
directed towards establishing the Austra-
lian conscience.
“We have a unique light to shed on
humanity and the problems of the world
today, but this unique light can easily
become cultural jingoism. We must get
away from smug isolationism. I don’t
feel that any one people is better than
any other people in culture, or, in fact,
better in anything. Every nation must play
its role in the drama of this planet.
“But Australians have still got to earn
the right to be here, and to prove we are
not just migrants in this part of the world.
If we are going to possess this land, we
must do it with love. Take the case of a
land developer, who comes in with his
bulldozer and strips the land of bush and
everything nature put there. He behaves
as if he were God. And then in place of
the bush you get this stupid little bit of
lawn, and a silly bed of marigolds. Oh,
yes, I can understand that the first genera-
tion of Australians wanted everything as
they had known it at home, but that sort
of thing shouldn’t go on past the first
generation.”
Mr Tucker said that he himself lived
20 miles from Melbourne.
“In five years time it will be spoilt,”
he said. “But at the moment things are
not too bad. However, 1 have done a lot
of talking and arguing and perhaps some-
thing has had some effect. I have noticed
that w'here they are laying some new
water-mains there is a slight zig-zag in
the pipes so that more trees can be pre-
served. Before they used to say it was
not possible to lay pipes with a zig-zag.”
Mr Tucker said he had been surprised
and delighted to discover how much
bushland still remained close to the heart
of Sydney. Only the day before he had
wandered through unspoilt gorges on the
North Shore.
Returning to the subject of art and the
Australian conscience, Mr Tucker said
that Australia simply had not yet been
visually explored. “Tom Roberts and his
colleagues took the first layer off,” he
said. “The figurative image is still a
potent thing. This does not mean that
an oblique statement cannot be far more
powerful than a direct one.”
Mr Tucker then poured some of his
most splendid scorn on the Australian
artists w'hose paintings he calls “glossy art
magazine cocktails” and condemns as a
“subversion of the creative act.”
Mr Tucker said that when Sidney
Nolan, a long-time friend and a corn-


panion of leaner days of greater obscu-
rity, first saw one of the Antipodean
heads he said: “You know, this is ex-
citing. This is the first time we have seen
a human image that doesn't come from
the Greeks.”
“More than 2000 years and we are just
beginning to see something new,” Mr
Tucker commented.
Mailer versus
Dostoevsky
From GEORGE MCGANN
in New York
The scene: Norman Mailer's pad in
Brooklyn Heights, a nautically-
flavored flat high above the harbor
with a gull’s-eye view of the skyscrapers
and canyons of Lower Manhattan. The
cast of characters: James Baldwin, Nor-
man Podhoretz, Mitch Miller, Ben
Gazzara and at least one hundred
assorted literati, journalists, television
types, off-Broadway performers and free-
loaders. The occasion: a blast to honor
the new light-heavyweight champion of
the world, Jose Torres of Puerto Rico
and Harlem. The time: 3 a.m., roughly
four hours after Torres had stopped
Willie Pastrano in the ninth round at
Madison Square Garden and been borne
from the ring on the shoulders of a
wildly hysterical mob of fellow islanders.
A three-piece combo played progressive
jazz in a corner and the guests have to
shout their orders to the bartenders
working ceaselessly at two makeshift
bars.
Nearly everyone talked boxing, the
suddenly “in"’ sport, and those who had
been in the Garden earlier held forth
on the highlights of Torres’ destruction
of the fallen champion. But others,
notably the guest of honor, preferred to
talk about the host’s newest novel, “The
American Dream’’, and deplore what
the critics had done to it—an act of
destruction on a par with Torres’ ring
performance. Torres insisted the book
was a masterpiece and that Mailer was
as much of a champion as Torres him-
self.
This thing of Mailer's about boxing
and boxers has evoked considerable
cynical comment from his numerous cri-
tics, who see in it a conscious attempt
to imitate Ernest Hemingway’s addiction
to bullfighting and his attachment to
Dominguin. Ordonez and the rest.
Whether or not Mailer has deliber-
ately cast himself as the inheritor of the
Hemingway writer-in-action bit, he plays
the Hemingway role of drinker, brawler,
lover, headline-maker to the hilt. In
fact, Mailer the hipster has gone well
past Hemingway the old-fashioned tough
guy. When did Hemingway ever pull a
knife on his woman? And when did
Hemingway, who also liked to think of
himself as the champ of the typewriter,
ever deliberately set out to outdo
Dostoevsky by contracting to serialise a
novel in monthly magazine instalments,
then write daringly against looming dead-
lines, with editors frantically making
last-minute corrections in a taxi on the
way to the printer?
This stunt resulted in “The American
Dream”, a product which the majority
of America’s literary critics consider
several light years removed from
Dostoevsky’s “Crime and Punishment”,
which Mailer apparently was trying to
emulate. Starting in January, 1866, the
Russian novelist wrote that masterpiece
in eight monthly instalments, working
against a November deadline. Mailer
started in January, 1964, and produced
eight instalments against a November
deadline for their publication in book
form. Like Dostoevsky at the time,
Mailer had been in something of a de-
cline since publication of his big war
novel, “The Naked and the Dead”, 17
years ago. Dostoevsky had been in
exile in Siberia for a decade prior to
“Crime and Punishment”. Mailer had
been at large but had not attempted a
novel since the critics flailed his “Barbary
Shore” and “Deer Park” in the early
'fifties. As Tom Wolfe (the young writer
on the “New York .Herald Tribune”)
has noted, Mailer wanted to make a
comeback with a big winner, as
Dostoevsky had done with “Crime and
Punishment”.
The parallel between “An American
Dream” and “Crime and Punishment” is
not confined to the circumstances sur-
rounding their creation. As Wolfe also
points out, there are many similarities
between the two novels in plot, theme
and detail. The hero in each murders
a woman, finds a prostitute as a result of
a street wreck and seeks her ministra-
tions, confesses his crime to the wanton
and later undergoes long interrogation
by the police. An epilogue to “Crime
and Punishment” describes Reskolnikov’s
banishment to the Siberian wastes. “An
American Dream” has an epilogue, too,
describing Rojack’s banishment to the
Las Vegas wasteland of poker machines
and vice.
The critics have had a field day with
“An American Dream”, cutting it to
pieces with a cheery venom seldom
matched since they chopped up the
Hemingway of “Across the River and
into the Trees”. What Mailer really is,
one contended, is a writer of detective
stories who has not found himself, a
second-rate James M. Cain. Another
seriously (at any rate he was writing for
the serious “New York Times”) likened-
Mailer to a comic cartoonist —“The
virility of superpeople, Apocalypse, eye-
ball-rays, this is the stuff of comic books.
What's missing from this one are the
pictures.”
Granville Hicks, also seriously, sug-
gested the novel was a hoax—“lf the
book is not a joke, a bad joke, it is
something worse.”
The criticism bounced off Mailer like
Willie Pastrano's futile jabs at Jose
Torres. Mailer long ago perfected his
peekaboo defence against critics of his
literary output and his private life. In
a recent “Esquire” piece he dismissed
the entire literary establishment as hope-
less squares. He had previously bombed
out the American Press in the same
publication as a collection of drunken
mediocrities, worthy of nothing more
than a contemptuous laugh. Like
Liberace, who shares his opinion of the
scriveners, Mailer can laugh all the way
to the bank. His book brought him a
150,000-dollar guarantee before publica-
tion (in fact before it was written) and
it has been sold to Hollywood for an
unannounced but undoubtedly typical
Hollywood price.
THEATRE
Shakespeare in Motley
Othello. William Shakespeare. Old Tote
Theatre, Sydney.
In the English theatre Shakespeare is
staged for adults, in the Australian
theatre for schoolchildren. Here, an oc-
casional production of one of the major
plays from the school syllabus does pious
but perfunctory homage to a great, but
dead, dramatist.
In England, as can be seen even from
films and television, the Shakespearian
- theatre is lively, fresh and colorful. Every
character, no matter how minor, is
played by trained actors. This is essential
in Shakespeare because all the verse must
be spoken fluently if the audience is not
to be distracted.
The Old Tote “Othello” is a typically

scrappy Australian production: a few
professional actors in the major roles
supported, though that is hardly the word,
by a motley collection of amateurs. Such
a state of affairs is unfair to the producer,
to the professional actors, to the audience
and, most of all, to Shakespeare.
In this production by Tom Brown I
was unable to detect the shaping hand of
the producer. There are some good indi-
vidual performances, but they do not
combine in a dramatic unity.
Ron Haddrick's Othello has great dig-
nity and authority but lacks expansive-
ness. It is the quiet, self-conscious author-
ity of an introspective man, not the
effortless command of the complete man
of action. As a result the change from
the ebullient general of the first half to
the jealous, tormented husband of the
second is not fully realised dramatically.
Alexander Hay plays lago as a cross
between a slapstick Richard 111 and a
comic mediaeval devil. This incongruous
pairing of a quiet Othello and a vulgar-
ised lago gives the feeling that the two
actors are performing in two different
plays. By making no attempt to appear
“honest”, as he is constantly described,
but instead displaying open cynicism,
Hay's lago appears to succeed in his
malign plots not through diabolical
cleverness but merely through the extra-
ordinary blindness and stupidity of every-
body else.
A further incongruity is Patricia Con-
oily’s Desdemona. In her first coquettish
appearance before the Senators she seems
to have minced in from a Restoration
comedy. Her performance gains depth in
the second half, but, skilful actress
though she is, she is not Desdemona.
Doreen Warburton’s Emilia good-
natured, down-to-earth and, finally,
heroic —is a very attractive perform-
ance.
Ron Reid’s colonnaded setting is effi-
cient, but it could equally well be used
for “Hamlet” or “Macbeth”. It is surpris-
ing that setting and lighfing are not used
more effectively to suggest the brightness
of Mediterranean skies and sea which
suffuses the poetry of “Othello”.
Until we have polished and exciting
productions of the great plays, especially
Shakespeare’s, our theatre will remain
essentially provincial. This is surely the
chief task the Elizabethan Theatre Trust
has to perform for drama in Australia.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
The Wretched South
Purlie Victorious. Ossie Davis. New
Theatre Company, Centre ’63, Mel-
bourne.
A converted warehouse seems a good
setting for this odd, tantalising comedy
on Negro integration —or on the dis-
integration of 01’ Cap’n Cotchipee,
symbol of the wretched South. The New
Theatre has fixed itself up with a home
in a lane at the back of Latrobe Street,
where the atmosphere is as rough, ready
and hearty as the tenor of “Purlie
Victorious”.
Ossie Davis, the man who wrote it,
is as off-beat as the idea behind his play.
Howard da Silva’s “The World of
Sholem Aleichem” is supposed to have
inspired him with the conviction that
stock characters can be infused with
such humanity and humor that any point
can be made through them. Which is
fair enough, and in this play the old
Jewish technique of laughing at yourself
through tears is vindicated in the cotton
fields. Davis clearly enjoys to shock
with the unexpected. Not long before
he set out to appear as Master of
Ceremonies in the Selma demonstrations,
he composed a funeral oration for
“Malcolm X”. But the Black Muslims
would have hated all that Purlie stands
for.
This improbable character is an up-
to-date Uncle Tom with a difference.
A vagabond, a confidence trickster and
a prophet of liberty, he returns to his
home-shack with a pretty girl in tow.
Lucibelle Gussie May Jenkin’s job is to
impersonate a woman for whom Ol’
Cap’n is holding a five hundred dollar
legacy. Purlie wants the money to
start his freedom church. The cash
is finally prised loose, and in the process
Georgia’s bullwhip paternalism is un-
knotted, unstrung and unpickled in a
bath of saccharine and acid. Purlie is no
hero. A great coward before the Lord,
he is a black Sancho Panza with
Quixote’s gift of words.
The play acts like a cock-eyed farce,
but I suspect it didn’t in New York.
. There is a holy rhythm in its unholy
chaos which allows Purlie’s ringing
oratory, hard on the heels of lying
gibberish, to sound like the rusty trumpet-
of a considerable angel. “You’re a dis-
grace to the Negro profession,” one of
the minor characters says. There are
Jewish jokes very much in this vein,
and they are not necessarily meant to be
derogatory. In the epilogue Jhe disgrace
to the profession apostrophises Cotchipee
from the pulpit. Cotchipee can’t talk
back: he died on his feet and has to
listen, upright, from his coffin, bedecked
with the Confederate flag.
Three members of the cast have really
tumbled to what this is all about and
how it should be approached. George
Cunningham is a thunderingly good
Purlie, and Frank Bren, as Cotchipee,
a great, doddering, dribbling White Peril.
But the find of the show is Jack Charles:,
the not so trustworthy Nigra who con-
soles his OP Cap’n with spirituals. Mr
Charles is a full-blood Aboriginal, a
natural actor and a galvanic presence.
DAVID MARTIN
TELEVISION
The Humor Business
Nearly everyone has a sense of humor,
so it should be a popular form of ex-
pression. The paradox is that individual
humorists are rare in any medium. Most
comedians need teams of writers who
are not humorists but create the product
by kicking ideas around until something
that may turn out funny occurs to them.
The motion picture and television indus-
tries mass-produce humor by gathering
assemblies of actors, creating situations
with humorous possibilities, and scripting
for laughs around those situations. It
is not a bad procedure for occasional
movies, but with rare exceptions it fails
in television, resulting only in humor
that becomes as funny, after a few
weeks, as an eternal diet of corn mush.
Possibly this is why the television
stations cram most of their humor
shows into the early evening “family”
viewing periods. Of all the American
shows of this type visible at night in
Sydney, thirteen clash so that the family
can see only five of them, but the others


are seldom any great loss. Most of
the American humor on view follows the
mass-produced formula, featuring fathers
or father-figures who are eternal fools,
monsters who think the rest of the
world’s abnormal, scatterbrains who al-
ways emerge victorious, hillbillies in a
wealthy setting, and other surefire boffo
situations.
The various characters in the casts,
calculated to meet the various laughter
responses of all kinds and all ages, take
turns at having the action revolve around
them. It would not be at all surprising
if the, basic scripts come from a compu-
ter. They are sufficiently mechanical
and soulless for it.
This is not a criticism of true Ameri-
can humor, which has always been virile,
and is still evident in the work of Glea-
son, Skelton, Kaye and Lucille Ball, in
television. These people are individual
humorists who create a world of their
own, peopled with characters who are
both unique and universal. They are
the true clowns of American television,
the rest are actors dressed as clowns.
British television has some very able
clowns in Sykes, Morecambe and Wise,
Haynes, Drake, and Hill. It also has a
large repertory of actors who specialise
in humor of all kinds. In recent weeks,
as one instance, I have seen Frank
Thornton in a variety of roles apart from
that of the Lieutenant Commander in
HMS Paradise, and he has been excellent
in each of them.
Unfortunately most of us do not see
much of British television humor. The
ABC alone uses it, if “uses” is the right
word. In Sydney at present the ABC
has only three humor shows a week —
Danhy Kaye, Eric Sykes, and one of the
American products, the ill-fated “Cara
Williams Show”. I am referring to the
hours of 7 p.m. on. The ABC has
the strange custom of running its best
British humor at 6.30 p.m., partly re-
peats and partly new shows. Why it
should consider Bootsie and Snudge suit-
able for children puzzles me. Most of
these shows would be more suitable for
late evening, when, heaven knows, the
ABC programmes could do with some
humor.
The facts indicate that the ABC has
precious little time for humor. It has
three shows to the commercial channels’
23, and in Sydney it is the only channel
without an Australian humor show. The
ABC’s only virtue in humor is that it
televises the one example of British
humor to be seen at night, after 7. It
seems weird that a country which
proudly boasts of its British stock should
have so little regard for the very rich
vein of British humor. If we have lost
the taste for it, that will never be re-
gained at the rate of one show a week,
among some 20 American humor shows.
Australian humor is still represented
only in three shows which are more
correctly variety rather than the true
product. One is “The Best of Kennedy”
masquerading as “Kevin Sanders Pre-
sents”. Another is “The Mavis Bram-
ston Show”, which presently seems, like
the lady in one of its sketches, to be
on heat. And the third is Melbourne’s
reply to it, an abbreviated “Ray Taylor
Show”, showing on TEN-10, the fourth
Sydney station which began televising
last week. The Great Australian Comedy
Show is still awaited.

FILMS
Lost Paradise
Les Enfants du Paradis. Director, Marcel
Carne. Savoy Theatre, Sydney.
The number of revivals being shown at
Sydney theatres is surely the greatest for
years. Walt Disney’s “Fantasia” is pack-
ing them in for the umpteenth time. “The
Bridge on the River Kwai” is having a
second season, as is ‘‘Peyton Place”.
“The Young Lions” has also been
around, though, to be fair, this was
shown at a theatre which makes a feature
of re-issues.
“Quo Vadis”, too, is having a new
lease of life —“colossal ‘Quo Vadis’ ”, as
the publicity dutifully labels it, though
by present-day movie standards it prob-
ably looks quite tiny. A few weeks ago
we even had that hoary double bill,
“Waterloo Bridge” and “Blossoms In
The Dust”!
Can there be such a shortage of new
product? What about all the films re-
leased overseas that we haven’t seen
“The Servant”, “Dead Image”, “The
Caretaker” among others? Or have the
distributors found that the film-going
public is so conservative it will only risk
the tried and true formulae?
For whatever reason, yet another re-
vival turns up at the Savoy. This one is
certainly of more than routine interest,
though to see it again is rather disillusion-
ing.
“Les Enfants du Paradis” was one of
the first French films shown here after
the war, and was widely hailed as a work
of art. Since the public were not then
conditioned to three-hour films, it was
shown in a cut version. This infuriated
Carne, its director, who even went to law
about it; but after seeing the full-length
version, I can assure him that a bit of
trimming would be all to the good.
Like all film-makers working during
the Occupation, Carne had either to make
straight-out propaganda films or set his
work in a safely remote past. Naturally
choosing the latter, he set “Les Enfants
du Paradis” in a carefully unspecified
part of last century; the script sedulously
avoids any reference to world affairs that
might pinpoint it too closely. Its sprawl-
ing narrative deals mainly with three
men an actor, a mime and a petty
crook and the influence on their lives
of the enigmatic beauty, Garance.
Since Carne was working under enor-
mous difficulties, it’s not to be wondered
at that the film is often technically slip-
shod. He had to use sets and studios
where and when he could get them; the
shortage of film stock forced him to use
some that would be rejected by a maker
of home movies. In consequence the film
is grainy and occasionally invisible; the
soundtrack, too, displays strange aberra-
tions. These distracting flaws must be
blamed on the exigencies of the time
when it was made; but these cannot ex-
plain the film’s long-winded verbosity, the
repetitive nature of its capable but un-
imaginative direction.
What still gives the film interest and
value is the quality of the performances.
Curiously enough, Jean-Louis Barrault
comes out of it worst his acting, petu-
lant and immature, gives only occasional
hints of his future greatness. But the work
of Arletty, Pierre Brasseur and Marcel
Herrand is still a delight to watch: fine
acting, even in an outmoded framework,
has a timeless quality.
Carne delved even further into the
past with his medieval fable “Les
Visiteurs du Soir”. From memory, I
should say this was a much better film
than “Les Enfants” but maybe that’s
just because I haven’t seen it for years.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
RECORDINGS
Britten’s Genius
Britten Symphony for Cello and Orchestra;
Haydn: Cello Concerto in C. Mstislav
Rostropovich (cello), and the English
Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Benja-
min Britten. Decca LXTA 6138 (mono),
SXLA 6138 (stereo).
It is a measure of Britten’s reputation
that the first recording of his new Cello
Symphony should be in general release
here less than twelve months after its
first performance in Moscow and con-
siderably less than that after its English
premiere. Few, if any, living composers
of serious music have had such a compli-
ment from the conservative Australian
record distributors.
The outstanding impression the work
leaves is one of high tensile strength. The
mood of the big first movement and the
recitative-like slow movement is one of
sombre emotional intensity; the second
movement is a nervy scherzo and the
final passacaglia, though more serene and
diatonic (its chief melody has a mo-
mentarily disconcerting reminiscence of
“Three Blind Mice’’), still keeps the lean
textures, sharp outlines and gritty har-
monies that mark the writing throughout.
The Haydn concerto is delightful,
offering a mettlesome first movement, a
lyrical, rather serious, slow movement
and an exuberant finale.

BOOKS
Goethe, Divine and Human
By CHARLES OSBORNE
Goethe: His Life and Times. Richard Frie-
denthal. Weidenfeld & Nicolson. £4 18s.
There is surely no other indisputably
great poet who is so little read outside
his own country. Lip-service continues to
be paid, of course: the names Shake-
speare, Goethe and Dante are still glibly
mentioned together as the three poets
of all time. But while Shakespeare thrives
in translation and “La Divina Corn-
media” at least is available in most
languages, Goethe suffers gross neglect.
He is, admittedly, a difficult poet to
know, because of the vastness and un-
evenness of his output. More than half
of his collected works are trivia, many
others are relevant only to their own
time and place, while a few are among
the most precious achievements of the
human spirit.
Anyone wishing to acquaint himself
with Dante knows what he must read;
if he wants to study
Shakespeare he need not
plough through the bad
plays among the thirty-
seven unless he wants to.
But with Goethe, where
to begin? “Faust”? “The
Conversations with Eck-
ermann”? “Dichtung und
Wahrheit”? The classical
plays, perhaps, or the
early lyrics? Or that
famous unread and now-
adays virtually unread-
able novel that
once gave rise to such scandal? The
great virtue of Dr Friedenthal’s book is
that it places all these works in a proper
perspective, and also goes some way
towards correcting the traditional picture
of Goethe as the serene Olympian
spirit, as remote from his own day as
from ours.
The destruction of this image is well
overdue. There was a time, not so long
ago, when Mozart was as misunderstood
as Goethe still is. The “divine Mozart”
of nineteenth-century representation was
a composer of polite galanteries, un-
ruffled, happy in his relationship with
his audience, charmingly indistinguishable
from Locatelli. Modern scholarship has
revealed the human Mozart to us, and
is on the verge of bringing the real
Goethe to light. This is an altogether
more difficult task to achieve, for it can-
not be denied that there are elements of
truth in the pious classical idea of
Goethe. But the facts are by no
means simple. He was not merely a
wild, romantic youth who too early in
life hardened into a lofty and unapproach-
able sage. The complex truth is some-
what more interesting: he was an in-
tensely neurotic personality, a fact that
could have been adduced easily enough
merely from a cursory glance at the
shape and dates of his entire oeuvre,
and the long periods of silence that sep-
arate them. He had hardly begun to
think of himself as an artist, or indeed
to form any idea of himself at all, be-
fore the age of forty. Prior to this he had
been a noisy virgin who had had, in his
extreme youth, a popular success with
a sentimental novel, and who appeared
unlikely ever to write anything else at all.
“Werther” had brought immediate
fame to the young Goethe. It had also
given rise to a spate of suicides and
parodies. Goethe, in fact, wrote a
counter-parody which ended with the
parodist relieving himself on the suicide’s
grave: “Delighted by his excrement/
With freer breath away
he went”. At this period
of his life he seemed to
himself and his audi-
ence to be a young god.
In his mid-twenties he
became the favorite of
the young Duke of Wei-
mar, and accepted the
offer of a post as the
Duke’s adviser. With the
exception of the time
when he fled to Italy, he
was to live in Weimar for
the rest of his long
life. Yet, within a few months of his
arrival there, he wrote of the “absolute
shittiness of this passing glory”. His
alterations of mood are almost manic-
depressive. As a very old man, he re-
marked that in the whole of his life he
had known scarcely four weeks of real
contentment.
Even in his youth, Goethe had a fear
of death so strong that the subject could
never be mentioned in his presence.
When his wife died, screaming in agony,
he managed to be confined to his own
room with catarrh, and not to see her.
His own death at the age of eighty-three
was not easy, contrary to the legend of
calm acceptance that has come down to
us. According to the physician who
attended him, “The pain, which became
more and more localised in his chest,
forced alternate groans and loud screams
from the tortured man. His features
were distorted, his face ashen, his eyes,
sunk deep in their livid sockets, were
dulled and feeble; in his look was the
most hideous fear of death . . .” The
conventional comforts of Christianity
were not available: he had never shown
much interest in that religion or its
founder.
He displayed, too, throughout his life,
an almost Jane Austen-like lack of in-
terest in the apparently important events
of his time. When, in 1791, he wrote
“Light and darkness wage constant war
with one another”, he is referring not to
the bloodier excesses of the French
Revolution but to his own eccentric
theories regarding the nature of color.
Goethe’s sexuality has its ambiguous
side. All the early famous romances
appear to have been no more than flir-
tations, love affairs on paper only. He
probably did not have intercourse with
a woman until, nearly forty, he escaped
to Italy and lived for a time with a
Roman girl. Returning to Weimar, he
shocked the court by taking as mistress
a local peasant girl, whom twenty
years later—he married. Rut his person-
ality was in many ways feminine. Schil-
ler said of him, “I look on him as a
haughty, prudish woman whom one
wants to get with child”. At the age of
thirty, Goethe became aware for the first
time of the human body. He persuaded a
friend, a young man, to bathe naked in
a lake, and watched him with evident
delight. Later in his life, on his second
Italian journey, he toyed with homo-
sexual feelings, imagining a female but
boyish waif as Ganymede and himself as
Zeus. He admitted to having known an
attraction for boys (though there is no
proof that he ever indulged in it). This
surely helps to explain the ease with
which he later imagined himself into the
pederastic tradition of Persian poetry
when he wrote the “West-Ostlicher
Divan”. The Mignon of “Wilhelm
Meister” with her yearning for Italy
(“Kennst du das land?”) is to a very
great extent Goethe himself. And even
the name “Mignon” has curious over-
tones. In the language of the day it
could, amongst other things, mean
“homosexual”.
What is certain is that Goethe re-
tained his sexual feelings into extreme
old age, when he took pleasure in watch-
ing young athletes. Regretting that his
old body prevented him from joining in
their exercises, he said, “Alas one is not
young enough to take the opportunity of
snatching a sweet kiss”. Nevertheless,
in his seventies he proposed marriage to
a nineteen-year-old girl.
If Italy made a man of him? it was
Schiller who finally made a poet of
him, or, to be more exact, brought him
to a proper respect for his vocation. For
Goethe is, of course, neither dramatist,
nor scientist, nor statesman. He is a
poet. After the early lyrical outpouring,
he lapsed into a ten-year silence punctu-
ated only by trivia. Then, after the
intervening classical period, came the
extraordinary sensuality of the later
poems, and the miracle of the second

part of “Faust”. His range was from
verse far too coarse and “obscene” even
to be included in printed editions today,
to the pure and rarified mystical world
of the closing pages of “Faust”. “In-
completeness stimulates,” he once said.
The incompleteness of his own restless
being stimulated him to produce here
a poetry akin to that of the late
Beethoven quartets with which “Faust”
(part 2) is contemporary. Passages from
the play are included in a recent Pen-
guin (“Goethe; Selected verse with an
introduction and prose translations by
David Luke”) which is indispensible to
the non-German-speaking reader who
wants to enter Goethe’s world. And
Dr Friedenthal’s detailed account of the
poet’s life and times provides additional
stimulus.

Chatto and Windus. 31s. 6d.
Prince Ishmael. Marianne Hauser. Michael
Joseph. 31s. 6d.
The Burning Bird. Samuel Youd. Long-
mans. Price not available.
In contrast to the childlike illustration
on its jacket and the label simplicity of
its title, “Second Generation” is a serious,
reasoned account of the problems of
labor m a company town in England,
reflecting author Raymond Williams's
interest in sociological questions affect-
ing the working class. He brings to this
study of two families, who have existed
by virtue of the motor company in their
town, and the “second generation” they
produce, a fine sense of the futility to
which modern labor has become heir
since it ceased to be a progressive, active
force fighting for real objectives and
became merely a mechanism for main-
taining the status quo.
“Second Generation” is of the genus
English social novel, full of conversa-
tions and ideas. Its extreme objectivity,
while ideally pointing up the disillusion-
ment of the old-time labor leaders, robs
it of any didactic significance and it
devolves primarily on the inevitable
schisms between one generation and the
next.
As the second generation which has
been given the means of rising out of
the environment which imprisons the
parents and yet remains inextricably
bound to it by heredity and the limits of
its own imagination, Peter Owen exists
in the twilight world between the motor
company, whose production line has an
unbreakable hold on his father, Harold
and his uncle, Gwyn, and the university
where he is striving for the higher degree
which will move him into a new world.
While his father devotes his time to
union activities to improve the workers’
lot and his mother Kate engrosses her-
self in labor politics in an effort to
change the system, Peter who represents
their only true escape from the world is
unable to accept the advance they have
made possible for him. The naively
idealistic Peter’s violent reaction against
Kate when she tries to fulfil her visions
of wider horizons with another man by
an infidelity which is essentially of the
minds, leads him to return to the factory
himself in the doubtlessly vain hope that
he can rescue the workers as well as
himself. By any standards, this reaction
must represent yet another failure to
escape from the system, especially when
allied with his return to his childhood
sweetheart Beth, a typical product of the
factory town.
“Prince Ishmael”, by Marianne Hauser,
is a fable, evocative, whimsical and lyri-
cal in its attempt to give substance to
the legend of Caspar Hauser, a mysteri-
ous figure who appeared in the town
of Nuremberg in the year 1828. He
became many things to many men, being
alternately reviled or worshipped as
swindler, darling of society, fraud, pea-
sant and even as a prince and angel,
until his death five years after his ap-
pearance in equally mysterious fashion.
“Prince Ishmael” is hardly a novel in
the accepted sense, having no real plot
and taking us nowhere. What makes the
book interesting is the quality of the
writing. Its precise, meticulous style is
of a type common to a school of Euro-
peans (Marianne Hauser is Swiss-born)
who have mastered English as a written
language. The similarity of characteri-
sation between Caspar and Gunter
Grass’s misanthropic hero of “The Tin
Drum” is striking but Miss Hauser lacks
Grass’s satirical bite.
Comments on human gullibility and
need are implicit in “Prince Ishmael”
rather than explicit; basically the book
is an interesting, imaginative exercise of
a largely academic nature, restating and
illuminating the legend without guiding
it to any conclusions. We are left to
speculate both on the mystery of Cas-
par’s appearance and existence and on
whether Miss Hauser’s choice of Caspar
Hauser as a subject is entirely coinci-
dental.
Despite the classical pretentiousness of
its title—an allusion to “the phoenix of
hope, that burning bird”—Samuel
Youd’s “The Burning Bird” exists on
on a much more mundane level. Trivial
is the word to describe Paul Arrodyce’s
progress through a couple of rather
tawdry love affairs and if we are sup-
posed to feel a sense of the justness of
Divine retribution (as I have an uncom-
fortable feeling we are) when Paul finally
becomes bitten instead of biter, then it’s
too absurd.
Paul is supported in his junior rake’s
progress through the luncheon spots of
the West End and the evening spots of


Chelsea by the British international oil
company for which he works, which
puts up with Paul's love-induced irregu-
larities of behavior because of his great
ability and potential (spoken of but
never demonstrated). The book is suit-
able for serialisation in one of those
English women’s magazines devoted to
propagating the delusions that bachelors
lead empty lives, earning a living does
not require much effort and love is more
important than anything else.
NOEL BUCKLEY
The Political Scramble
The Prime Minister’s Daughter. Maurice
Edelman. Hamish Hamilton. 235.
The Rich Pay Late. Simon Raven. Anthony
Blond. 265. 6d.
The Australian villain of Maurice Edel-
man’s novel, “The Prime Minister’s
Daughter”, is the owner of a popular
and influential newspaper in London, a
man who loves to have a finger in every
political pie. It has been his fondest
dream, since the time at Adelaide race
track when his father pointed out to him
a member of the English peerage, to
become Lord Mayland. When his
nomination, at last put up, is rejected by
the Honors Scrutiny Committee on
account of a prison sentence he served
in Broken Hill, Mayland turns nasty and
vents his spite on the Prime Minister.
Destiny plays into his hands when the
eponymous daughter is arrested for
driving under the influence but released
without being charged, apparently upon
the intervention of her father. Mayland
presses the PM’s enemies to put forward
a motion of censure on the basis of the
alleged intervention, hoping to bring
about his dismissal from office. But
Melville is able to prove his innocence
of the charge and ends up with all the
firmer support for his unpleasant experi-
ence.
Meanwhile the Prime Minister’s
daughter, Sylvia Melville, who had a
traumatic experience in childhood which
disturbed filial and sexual relations, gets
involved with an American university
don, already married and with a family.
This affair causes her a great deal of
unhappiness and is the indirect cause of
her father’s predicament, but, like him,
she emerges finally somewhat the better
for the experience, and the novel ends
with a promise of better relations all
round. x
A few ends seem to be loose, however,
which leads one to question the state-
ment made in the blurb to the effect that
this is the last of Mr Edelman’s parlia-
mentary novels. For instance, near the
end of the book the PM has an attack
which is clearly an incipient coronary
occlusion; the attack proper must surely
have been put off for some future
volume.
If the prospect of a sequel to “The
Prime Minister’s Daughter” is perfectly
agreeable, the announcement at the head
of “The Rich Pay Late,” that it is the
first of a series of ten novels “to cover
the English upper middle class scene
since the war”, can only cause misgiving.
There is a similarity in plot
between the two books but Mr Raven's
is distinctly inferior on all counts.
It, too, presents the story of a ruth-
less man’s attempt to ruin the career of
a public figure by impeaching his morals.
Once again the attack is proved to be
groundless and the victim exonerated.
Novels which purport to reveal intrigue
and immorality in the lives of prominent
people are much in demand nowadays,
and there is no denying their fascination.
But while the portrait of Westminster
in “The PM's Daughter” is completely
convincing, Mr Raven’s is not so suc-
cessful. His novel manages to hold in-
terest throughout but one is all the time
aware of poor writing. The resolution
is achieved along the lines of a detective
story, the characters (in particular the
villain, though one can be grateful at
least that he is not an Australian) are
improbable and the style hardly more
than journalese.
The intrigue in this tale is more
scabrous than in the other. Jude
(Judas?) Holbrook wants to obtain the
proprietorship of a weekly journal of
economics to boost his advertising busi-
ness. To do this he has to blackmail
his partner’s wife into securing her hus-
band’s agreement to the scheme, em-
bezzle his mother for the money, bribe
the editor to give his support, and finally,
but unsuccessfully, attempt to blackmail
an MP member of the board into voting
in his favor. The MP had as a youth
nobly given financial and moral support
to a blind girl, victim of gang rape in a
village orgy; Holbrook attempts to cir-
culate the story that it was the MP him-
self who seduced the girl.
The excuse for all this is a theme
pretentiously announced in the author’s
note: “human effort and goodwill are
persistently vulnerable to the malice of
time, chance and the rest of the human
race”. True perhaps, but Mr Raven
adds little to our understanding of the
problem.

Three on the Mountain
Although the mountain promised
weekday quiet,
we found the rainforest tense with
watching things
and intricate noises: leaves scuttled out
of sight
without warning; shafts of light flashed
wings
and were lost in the quick pattern of
treeferns, wet
with foliage; branches clasped shut
behind us, visitors,
tourists, three who found the track but
forgot
to read the length of the way engraved
on the notices
and now had come too many miles to
return.
Mould crumpled and rotted in our
footprints
and an irritable silence sucked each one
of us, leeching at anger, passing
sentence
upon our unity, dividing us.
“You should have said how far it was—
my sandal
cuts, and look at the mudstains on my
dress!”
My girlfriend bitched at the end of love
become tangible
and our hands were only a formal bond
where sweat
chafed and fettered: My brother with
us strode
ahead, counting the numerals of his
feet,
last minute guest, intruder upon our
bad
and selfish silences, out on his own.
“It’s half past three already,” was all
he said,
resigned to whittle place and period .
down,
aware that neither of us even heard.
And I: “This is the place we came to
see,
enjoy it then!” angry among the rot
of strangling vines, of insects too sharp
to flee,
of choked air and the low enveloping
heat,
resentful of these two stumbling by me,
cut with the same switches, soiled and
worn
by the same mudstains, sweating
equally,
yet living in different reasons not my
own,
suddenly strangers, dangerous and
unknown.

Camusian Morality
The Martyred. Richard Kim. Hutchinson.
235.
A State of Mind. Jane Lane. Muller. 255. 6d.
“The Martyred” is dedicated to the
memory of Albert Camus and one there-
fore expects conscious echoes in this un-
usual first novel by a young Korean now
teaching at an American university. Told
with the apparent simplicity of langu-
age of “The Fall” and with a setting
reminiscent of "The Plague” (but without
the allegory), the examination of the
many facets of Truth and Goodness is in
line with the philosophy of “The Rebel”.
Kim poses two questions: is truth abso-
lute or divisible? And is goodness to be
judged by beliefs or by actions? Into
Korea, just before the Northerners move
into Pyongyang again, come two Chris-
tian ministers, Mr Shin and mad Mr
Hann, the sole survivors of 14 church-
men who had been captured, tortured
and executed by the Communists. The
morale of the town is strengthened by
what it celebrates as the inspiring ex-
ample of its 12 martyred ministers,
while the two who were released are
suspect.
Mr Hann is hounded to death as a
traitor and Mr Shin is left with the choice
of telling the truth and thus robbing the
already demoralised people of their only
comfort, or of sacrificing himself for
their salce. Mr Shin remains silent. Then
comes the final shattering revelation to
the reader, that he chose this way to sus-
tain the faith of others, although he him-
self is no longer able unfalteringly to sus-
tain his own. The truth he tells is the
truth they need; the goodness is for its
own sake.
“A State of Mind" also deals with
religious beliefs, but there the similarity
ceases. Followers of Christianity, an old
religion, are banished to the Hebrides
while the Communists are the Right-wing
Party in an After-the-Nuclear-Explosion
world (in which, incidentally, everyone
seems to have survived intact). After an
unhappy love-affair, Clare visits a Self-
Elimination Home where she meets Peter
who is a former priest. He is also bent on
suicide, having lost his faith after he
had been sent from the Hebrides to
spread the “subversion” of Christianity.
But it all works out all right when they
save each other from death.
An Orwell or a Huxley might have
brought it off. Miss Lane, an historical
novelist, might do better to stick to the
past. The future seems still too much of a
closed book.
MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Dry Satires
Poems. C. S. Lewis. Geoffrey Bles. 20s.
Poems. Anthony Naumann. Collins. 15s. 6d.
C. S. Lewis’s “Poems”, edited by his
secretary, gathers together verse written
over the last forty years. Lewis’s poems
are marginal to his prose and many are,
predictably enough, on Biblical and
theological themes. He is at his best, I
think, in his dry little academic —satirical
attacks on the modern world, and in his
stanzas to Roy Campbell. Some of his
epigrams and epitaphs are pleasantly
witty. But this is a book for C. S.
Lewis enthusiasts rather than for those
who care about poetry.
Apart from some effective pieces of
realistic observation, Anthony Nau-
mann’s book is notable for its poems
addressed to Dylan Thomas and Marilyn
Monroe. These have the force inherent
in any genuinely felt protest against
futility, parasitism and indifference.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A Taste of Paris
E'rance is doing a remarkable PR
1 job to assert her position in
Europe and recently sent British PM,
Mr Wilson, back home with pro-
mises of French co-operation in in-
dustrial production and economic
measures.
As a result, Mr Wilson trumpeted
that France has the greatest confidence
in the £ sterling. It was obvious,
however, that France was confident
only if Mr Wilson kept to his pro-
mise that Britain would do some
streamlining and “toughen up her
economic fibres”.
Delicate emphasis was placed on the
touchy subject of continued joint work
on the production of the proposed
Anglo-French Concorde aircraft with a
thumbs down on Britain’s expensive
TSR-2 bomber (and the prospect that
the UK will buy French Mirage bom-
bers).
The big news of an international
nature was that Britain and France
were considering the establishment of
a new international currency unit. No
details of this Gaullic francquid are
available, but for years the French
have been talking about the need for a
new international currency which was
exchangeable into foreign currency or
commodities.
De Gaulle is pleased by all this,
because it coincides with his policy of
preserving independence from the US.
Talk is one thing, performance is
another. Mr Wilson still went home to
face renewed doubts about sterling and
an unpopular Budget. His troubles can-
not be solved overnight and the Euro-
pean central bankers will breathe down
his neck in the next few months to see
if his balance of payments improves.
Meanwhile, France gaily proceeds
to improve on her image. She scored
a hit when the Soviet decided to adopt
the French SECAM system of color
television. Also, adopting a leaf from
Uncle Sam’s book on tax stimulus,
France has decided to reduce company
tax. Although France’s basic company
tax rate remains high at 50 p.c., she
proposes to cancel the withholding tax
and, by a system of tax credits, will
permit a higher proportion of dividend
income to be paid to shareholders.
This tax gimmick, plus economic
forecasts that France will avoid a re-
cession this year, prompts French
leaders to believe they can afford to
watch patiently while America strives
to curb the balance of payments deficit,
because it is clear that US action will
hurt sterling, yen, the Canadian dollar
and South American currencies before
it will hurt the franc. Under these con-
ditions, France can wheedle some con-
cessions from others whose balance of
payments are not strong and so further
PRESIDENT DE GAULLE
its plans for an integrated Europe in
which France is a key figure.
Britain’s inability to keep down her
prices, thus weakening her competitive
strength, no doubt pleases de Gaulle,
and his less frigid attitude to Britain
probably is encouraged by political
considerations which acknowledge that
Mr Wilson achieved some outward suc-
cess from his visit to West Germany. If
Britain and West Germany strongly
follow the American line, France’s
campaign for European independence
of America is weakened.
On the financial front, France
scored again last week. Immediately
after France had announced a new
company tax scheme which would per-
mit an average shareholder to improve
his after-tax income from 32i p.c. to
48f p.c., Britain lifted company tax
from 7s. 9d. in the £ to Bs. 3d. and
imposed a capital gains tax.
The Bourse in Paris reflected im-
proved investment sentiment by
registering a strong gain in share prices.
But, of course, those crazy Englishmen
had to do one stupid thing in the Bud-
get to upset otherwise excellent rela-
tions with French businessmen. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Cal-
laghan, cancelled tax concessions on
business lunches and entertainment,
except entertainment given to overseas
buyers. Mon Dieu, you have to buy
British goods before you can get a free
lunch!
Liquidity Scramble
"EWeryone is intent on slashing capital
outflow. Britain now hopes to
restrict capital outflow by at least
£stgloom. with the latest Budget mea-
sures. In fact, Mr Callaghan sees fur-
ther tax reforms in the years ahead to
curb capital profits and reduce public
spending.
It is fashionable today for govern-
ment officials to turn inwardly and
slash at overseas investments which
may be causing a net drain on a
nation’s resources. Yet it wasn’t so
long ago that everyone was crying for
increased international liquidity and
the need for more funds to finance
world trade.
Now, with world trade losing its
impetus and a deflationary era settling
in, the trend is towards international
restraints rather than stimulus.
America already is proving that its
campaign to improve its balance of
payments is having a major effect on
many countries which had relied
heavily on the outflow of dollars to
support world trade.
France, by getting tough over con-
version of dollars into gold, started the
scramble for internal liquidity and,
since America joined in the race, the
high-sounding calls for world trade
have been pushed into the background.
Britain’s crisis in sterling awoke
many people to the dangers of a pos-
sible devaluation, because the under-

mining of one currency inevitably has
damaging effects on other major cur-
rencies used in international exchange.
The result, as pointed out in these
columns some time ago, was a surrep-
titious demand for gold by European
nations which did not want to be
caught with their exchange down.
Britain often has been criticised as
an exploiter of overseas territories but
the latest Board of Trade Journal on
overseas investment showed that
British companies operating in over-
seas countries have remitted a smaller
share of their profits than foreign cor-
porations established in the UK.
The percentage of earnings remitted
by British overseas companies was 46
p.c. in 1962, 45 p.c. in 1963 and 47
p.c in 1964. The highest recent figure
was 51 p.c. in 1961 when the Ex-
chequer pressured companies for in-
creased remittances.
Remittances by overseas corpora-
tions operating in Britain were 69 p.c.
of earnings in 1961, 52 p.c. in 1962,
42 p.c. in 1963 and 57 p.c. in 1964.
With President Johnson’s request for
a definite improvement in remittances
this year, it can be seen that the out-
flow from the UK could rise quite
sharply from last year’s 57 p.c.
Britain’s capital gains tax on assets
held for longer than a year is a flat
rate of 30 p.c. in the current financial
year and capital gains by companies
also are included in the net. There will
be less encouragement for profits on
property deals "and the latest trend
could encourage overseas investors to
stay in their own backyard.
Woolworths’ Finance

expansion in the next year poses ques-
tions on how the company will finance
60 new stores and several new drive-
in shopping centres like the 12-acre
project recently completed at Jesmond,
Newcastle.
Fortunately the company has gone
heavily into the lease-back system of
selling its properties to life institutions
and leasing them back again, usually
on a 40-year term.
Use of undistributed profits and de-
preciation allowances could provide
resources of around £2fm., while the
sale of properties and the extension of
mortgages could raise the other £6Jm.
Woolworths, like others, is discover-
ing that the important future shopping
outlets rely heavily on parking-area-
type supermarkets, so the company
plans to increase these units from 130
to 165. By 1966, the company expects
to be operating 850 stores in Australia
and (through its associated company)
65 in New Zealand.
Woolworths now is heavily involved
in food and associated grocery and
pharmaceutical lines (boot - polish,
tooth-paste, soap, etc). Although food
lines represent only half the average
profit margin on variety lines, there
is a faster turnover and more people
are attracted to the stores.
The Bulletin quizzed Mr Theo
Kelly, the chairman, about the likely
effect on Woolworths’ sales of tighter
monetary conditions. He said that past
experience had shown that, during
booms, Woolworths’ sales had not
shown the sharp uplift which others
might experience but, similarly, in
tighter periods, the sales graph did not
dip so sharply. Most customers were
regular purchasers who bought only
what they needed.

Australia’s Factory Output Growth
High place in world production league
HThey didn’t make the society pages
but, figuratively speaking, two up-
standing sons were born last week, one
a veritable Golgotha fathered by Mr
K. M. Archer, Commonwealth Statisti-
cian, the other of less Rabelaisian dimen-
sions by Dr H. C. Coombs, Governor
of the Reserve Bank.
One refers of course to the long-
awaited appearance of the Common-
wealth Statistician’s Index of Factory
Production. Mr Archer has been work-
ing on this for many years. The other
is the Reserve Bank’s dissection of the
trading banks overdraft limits. The
former, for all the apologia about it in
the announcement, will fill a yawning
gap in official statistics. The latter takes
the veil off probably the most mystifying
element in the world of bank credit.
The Index of Factory Production fills
the longest-felt want in Australia’s sta-
tistical equipment. Although this column
has been pressing for the gap to be
filled these many years, it is an open
secret that the Bureau of Census and
Statistics has been loath to undertake the
task in view of the enormous difficulties
involved in constructing a reliable one.
It has always been a sore point with
economists and businessmen here that
while the Bureau’s Monthly Review of
Business Statistics has for a long time
included a table of industrial production
indexes for about a dozen industrialised
countries, Australia has not been in it.
When we take our place in the next
issue of the Monthly Summary it will be
seen that in recent years we have reason
to be pretty satisfied with our factory
output performance on an international
comparison. For more than eight years
to 1963 our output rose by 47 p.c.,
more, in fact, than any other country’s,
excluding the war-shattered economies
of Japan, whose output is up 222 p.c. in
this period; Italy, where output about
doubled, and France and Germany,
where roughly a three - fifths rise
occurred. Our 47 p.c. increase com-
pares favorably with that of both the
industrial giants—the US, 29 p.c., and
Britain, 20 p.c.—and with Canada, 39
p.c., Belgium, 30 p.c., and Sweden, 39
p.c.
In hailing the appearance of the offi-
cial index, The Bulletin doesn’t want
to take anything away from the achieve-
ment of the ANZ Bank in producing its
unofficial one. The latter has been
enormously useful in keeping us in touch
with the trend of industrial production.
Maybe we have grumbled a bit about
ic M. ARCHER
its time lag in getting out the figures,
but we’ve realised its compilation has
been done largely at second-hand from
the Bureau’s own raw material on pro-
duction, a consideration which could
possibly mean that the official index will
bring us up to date rather more quickly.
Nor are we decrying the usefulness of
the Bureau’s own monthly series of
actual volume production covering 35
separate industries. This is produced in
double quick time and gives a ready-
reckoner of seasonal trends even if not
for national factory output as a whole.
There is no indication thus far that the
Bureau intends to correct its index for
seasonal factors, though, of course, this
is done by the ANZ and is a unique
service.
The new index gives us, for the first
time, a series conforming to the Statis-
tician’s standard industrial classifications,
for which, of course, there are many
related series such as for employment,
wages, fixed investment and so on. In
effect the index of the quantity of out-
put of these 14 industrial groups and
their numerous subdivisions will greatly
facilitate economic analysis and fore-
casting. As tbe index has been taken
back, with untold effort one would pre-
sume, to 1949-50, it will be most help-
ful for economic research. So far the
figures have been brought up to 1962-63
but there is a promise of more recent
ones to come soon. The figures since
1959-60 have been based on that year
equalling 100 and on group weightings
also of that year. Those for the previ-
ous ten years have been based on 1955-
56 equals 100 with weights of that year.
It should be emphasised that the Com-


monwealth Statistician is quite open in
confessing to the limitations of the index
and the methods used in compiling it.
Usually any reservations made by the
authors of a new index go rapidly into
limbo and things are claimed for it which
were not in its original prospectus.
However, Mr Archer is obviously fairly
satisfied with his labors, saying that the
methods adopted “appear inherently
reasonable and are generally accepted as
leading to useful measures. Neverthe-
less they necessarily carry many assump-
tions and implications and thus leave
many problems without satisfactory solu-
tions”.
Inevitably, to get a quantitative index
of factory production, the Statistician
ran up against one of the biggest snags
in economics—the task of clubbing to-
gether into an artificially homogeneous
whole, a group of heterogeneous com-
modities. As will be appreciated, for
general economic purposes, the only
practicable way of aggregating quanti-
ties of diverse commodities and services
is in terms of money value. In fact this
was the Statistician's basic .approach, to
ascertain the net value as well as the
quantity of production for individual
commodities so as to calculate their
unit values and then to discount -for
price changes. This is cutting a very
long story short because, as he states,
the complexities were enormous. The
up-shot is that the index is virtually one
of estimated value of output at constant
prices and assumed weights.
The index is most revealing in the
various weightings attributed to the
separate industrial groups. The biggest
on the 1959-60 basis is for industrial
metals, machines and conveyances, 40.9
p.c., then food, drinks and tobacco, 12.5
p.c., chemicals, dyes, explosives, paints
and oils, 8.6 p.c., paper, stationery and
printing, 7.2 p.c., clothing, 5.7 p.c.,
textiles, 5.2 p.c., and sawmills, joinery
and boxes, 4.7 p.c. Presumably these
percentages could indicate some rough
order for the relative importance (in
1959-60) of the output of secondary in-
dustries in this country, though not
necessarily of the relative economic im-
portance of the various industries. The
index does not pretend to measure the
latter but merely to measure variations
in output which it gives for the many
sub-groupings, as well as factory indus-
try as a whole.
Of the many useful conclusions to
be drawn from the series now provided,
one is that in the 1950 s the biggest
expansion of output in any one factory
industry was in chemicals. On the
basis of 1955-56 equals 100, this group
started the decade with an index figure
of 51 and finished it with 146, nearly a
threefold increase. Next highest rate of
expansion was in mine and quarry pro-
ducts treatment, then in “metals,
machines and conveyances”, both only a
shade lower than chemicals. The only
industry whose output was lower at the
end of the decade was skins and leather.
As for the performance of various
industries over the three years since the
1959-60 boom (figures after 1962-63 are
not available yet) it emerges that output
in only four groups fell in the recession
to below the 1959-60 level. These were
“skins and leather”, “textiles”, “bricks
and pottery”, and “rubber”. They had
all recovered by 1962-63. On the re-
maining ten groupings whose output
continued to rise in these three years,
chemicals achieved the biggest increase,
24 p.c., as against 22 p.c. for treatment
of mine and quarry products, and also
for furniture. It is interesting to note
that while output in the industrial metals,
machines and conveyances group drop-
ped in the worst year, 1961-62, it remain-
ed above its 1959-60 level in that year.
In 1962-63 its recovery was so strong
that its output rose proportionately more
than any other group.
CROESUS
Absence of Animal Spirits
Blighting life for the businessman
As its economic round-ups usually do,
the latest by the Institute of Public
Affairs catches the mood and trend of
things with sober reserve. An economy
free of animal spirits is jogging through
the boomless boom without a sense of
carnival. Spenders are cautious. Some
- businessmen seem almbst unhappy, won-
dering with all the imponderables,
whether this is really prosperity and, if it
is, how long it will last.
Even if “the prospect at the moment
is for further increases in costs and
prices” the IPA thinks the fact that a
high level, of activity and continued
expansion have been achieved without
feverish speculative activity and over-
optimistic spending is a cause for gra-
titude rather than gloom. After all,
this is what we wanted.
Yes, indeed! In this spirit the IPA
thinks it has the last laugh over “savage
critics” of stop-and-go policies who have
had nothing to criticise in the conduct of
economic policy for a long time. How-
ever, no intelligent critic of stop-and-go
policies need feel dejected. He can
only applaud either the authorities for
their handling of economic policy, alter-
natively make an offering to external
economic goddesses for their bountiful
help in keeping balance of payments
wolves at bay.
This is not to say that the critics of
stop-and-go have had their day. Nor
is the IPA giving any assurances on
that. It points out dangers in our eco-
nomic horoscope without actually con-
firming businessmen in their suspicion
that another stop could be in the offing
at any time.
The economy is fully stretched, it says,
and the bigger intake of migrants will
impose additional strains on resources.
On the other hand it sees some slacken-
ing ahead in the use of resources by the
building and motor industries which
should, it thinks, release some resources
for defence use. In any case the impact
of defence on the use of resources will
be the less because of the big overseas
element in defence expenditure. So,
reading between the IPA’s lines, the
containment problem is not seen as in-
tractable enough to demand excessive
restraints from official quarters.
In a word: internally things may be
going fairly well and demanding only
the gentlest touches, this way and that,
on the brake in the manner of the more
enlightened guidance of Dr Coombs.
Presumably when the various discernible
clouds on the balance of payments hori-
zon get somewhat closer his soporific
effects on internal buoyancy will be
strengthened. In any case his present
ones will have done good work. The
prospect, then, is not for a “credit
squeeze”, a big “stop”, that is.
This brings to mind a recent little
book written by Dr J. O. N. Perkins
analysing “Anti-Cyclical Policy in Aus-
tralia, 1960-64”, published by MUP for
7s. 6d., or 75 cents, in which the author
comes out as a mild apologist of stop-
and-go, at least of his own interpreta-
tion of it. “It would be a pity,” he says
in his equivocal way, “if uninformed cri-
ticism of frequent variations of policy
(often characterised as “stop-go”) were
to prevent the adoption of suitable
flexible policies.” If this is taken together
with some of his more specific conclu-
sions, Perkins comes out as having few
inhibitions about the usefulness of bold
and frequent official steps to stimulate
or restrain the economy.
Before going into some of these, pos-
sible readers of this tightly written affair
should be warned that though they will
find it very useful for path-finding among
policies and their effects along the curve
of the latest trade cycle in Australia,
Perkins has an unhappy knack of quali-
fying statements. This makes the read-
ing rather tortuous. There is far too
much obiter dicta, too many unnecessary
interventions to his argument which stop

the flow, too many brackets. It also
makes the matters he is treating look
more complicated than they really are.
Again, he is a bit unkind, the reader
feels, to the Press for sometimes taking
what to him is the “glib”, simplified and
supine view about economic policy, for-
getting perhaps that our audience is the
general public and the business commu-
nity. It is not necessarily comprised of
experts in the Treasury or students in the
lecture room where there is plenty of
time for leading people into fascinating
by-ways and alley-ways of the academic
economic path.
For all that, this is a very good little
anvil for businessmen anxious to strike
a blow against “stop-and-go” mentalities.
If Perkins is a guide, these are still to
be found in academic as well as official
circles. My main complaint about it is
not so much in the writing as in its
patronising attitude towards the authori-
ties whom he trusts will do better “with
experience”, its off-hand manner to
those who hold reasoned views, say,
about controlling fringe financiers, and
its disrespect for business expectations.
Dr Perkins would keep the business
community on the jump all the time.
This is the great gulf between him and
the business world.
Businessmen whose main job is to take
a view will writhe at Dr Perkins’ advo-
cacy in this book (which he says is based
on the lectures he gives at Melbourne
University) that “efforts should con-
stantly be made to continue and extend
the degree of flexibility of budgetary
measures that was achieved in Austra-
lia in the early 19605”.
In this spirit he wants us to get used
to frequent changes in income tax. He
thinks the readiness to vary income tax
cyclically, and even more than once in
the course of a year, should be carried
further, so that such variations come to
be accepted as a normal measure and
not merely for use in extreme circum-
stances.
He would keep us for ever on the
tax hop. Apparently, also, he w'ould like
us to get used to having little budgets
between the big ones, at least ‘'unless
it is felt that monetary measures alone
can meet the changes that occur before
the next annual budget”.
Perkins’ operative word is “flexibility”
as much in monetary as in fiscal policy.
He would have Dr Coombs as well as
Sir Roland Wilson perpetually at the
businessman's elbow. Indeed, if only
monetary measures worked faster he
would plague us with these in prefer-
ence to fiscal changes. But the effect
of monetary measures being slow he
sees the main reliance having to be
placed on budgetary measures. Most
people would agree with this, but Per-
kins is not prepared to let monetary
measures go by default because they
work more slowly and are less certain in
their effects than fiscal measures.
In admitting the limitations of mone-
tary measures, he sees these not as an
argument for not using them, but rather
as one for making them stronger when
they are used. If they are weak in their
effects, he says, this is as good an argu-
ment for using them in a forthright man-
ner, as for placing greater reliance on
budgetary measures. There is a lot of
sense in that. At least when a psycho-
logical impact is desired, small monetary
measures are useless. Indeed when, as
has been done over the last year, the
authorities proceed little by little to stiffen
monetary policy, not only is business
kept guessing, which is undesirable, but
loan raisings suffer. Potential sub-
scribers to loans hold off in expectation
that interest rates will go still higher.
When, over the last year, Dr Coombs
felt obliged to give touches to the inter-
est rate and bank lending brakes his aim
was merely to steady economic activity,
not crab it. The need was the greater
perhaps because, even on the showing of
the last Budget, he probably took the
view, as this column did, that the scale
of increases in Government spending
outweighed any restraining effect which
the Treasurer attributed to tax increases.
In other words an opportunity was
lost in the Budget to use fiscal measures
strongly. They would have worked
much more firmly than monetary mea-
sures. This is not to say the monetary
restraints would have been unnecessary
to complement them. We probably have
much still to learn in the matter of in-
tegrating monetary and fiscal policy.
Certainly Dr Perkins’ discussion of this
is most helpful.
However, the more he ponders the
economic armory the more vacant places
he finds. The proliferation of new wea-
pons is more unnerving than his sugges-
tions for improving central bank and
Treasury techniques. The abiding im-
pression is that given a free hand Dr
Perkins would make official controls even
more of a nightmare for businessmen
than they are now. His justification
doubtless would be that if we all be-
came accustomed to expecting the
authorities regularly to pull one or more
of a number of new controlling levers
. . . even the exchange rate . . . the less
likelihood there would be of their
t striking hammer blows as they did in
1960. It is a challenging thought.

THE INTERNAL PHONE WITH THE EXPANDING FUTURE
In thousands of building and rebuilding projects throughout Aus-
tralia, prime consideration is being given to provision for potential
growth. One important aspect is the inevitably required expansion
of telephone facilities within an organisation. The STC PAX
provides the most economical, most efficient, solution to this vital
problem.
STC PAX systems commence where required, with a basic 10 line
system, available in one compact unit. When further lines are
needed the system can be quickly and economically developed to
accommodate them.
Further, tiejines can be used to connect together two PAX systems
thus providing complete intercommunication between all exten-
sions of both. Special facilities such as central dictation, loud
speaking telephones, secretarial system, full range of modern
lightweight coloured handsets are also included in the economical
STC PAX.
An important feature is that STC PAX provides fully automatic
inter-communication between extensions with complete secrecy.
Executive priority is provided for selected extensions.

INVESTMENT
Britain’s Stiff Budget
The loopholes are small
UK Budget proposals on overseas
A investment are only the first shots
in what promises to be a long, drawn-out
skirmish.
Mr Callaghan, Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, intends to re-negotiate Britain’s
double tax agreements so that double tax
relief is given only on earnings where the
UK company owns 25 p.c. or more of the
overseas company.
To reinforce his bargaining with ster-
ling area countries, he may point out that
he has refrained from direct exchange
controls (which many were advocating
strenuously in London) but, if he meets
too much opposition in establishing new
double tax agreements, he may be forced
to resort to sterner measures.
He could cause some headaches among
UK directors who are already faced with
a new corporation tax, a 30 p.c. capital
profits tax, and an increase in the basic
tax rate (where dividends are taxed at the
source) from 7s. 9d. to Bs. 3d. in the £.
UK investors who currently are per-
mitted to claim UK tax rebates on divi-
dends received from double tax agree-
ment countries like Australia (where a
withholding tax of 15 p.c. is deducted
before remittance), will pay a straight tax
like everyone else. UK shareholders in
Australian companies who previously had
a higher effective yield because of the
double tax concessions, will lose their
advantage. Thus there will be-less en-
couragement to invest overseas. To this
extent, UK portfolio investment in Aus-
tralia could suffer.
Companies classified as Overseas
Trading Corporations which elected to
be taxed on their profits in the overseas
country will no longer be able to claim
such benefit after this year. This involves
Dalgety and New Broken Hill Consoli-
dated, two popular London stocks.
Not all these tax changes will be effec-
tive immediately, but notice has been
given.
From the Commonwealth Govern-
ment’s point of view, it is a good thing
that the stern Budget measures have
helped to bolster sterling. Australia’s
overseas reserves of up to £BOO million
could have lost £BO million overnight if
sterling were forced to devalue by, say,
10 p.c.
Sterling area countries have honored
their gentlemen’s agreement with Lon-
don by leaving their currency reserves
(foreign exchange earnings, borrowings,
etc.) in London and these, in turn, help
to contribute to Britain’s reserves. With-
out them, Britain’s reserves would have
looked very sick indeed during the recent
run on sterling.
It also means, however, that these
overseas funds in London can flow freely
as an exchange medium for sterling area
members. If Britain had frozen those
funds and imposed strict exchange con-
trols, it could have been embarrassing.
At the same time, Mr Callaghan hopes
to restrain capital outflow by at least
fstglOOm. per annum and there cer-
tainly will be less money coming to
Australia. Sale of foreign securities must
be converted to sterling for 25 p.c. of the
proceeds as a curb on the flight of capital.
At first thought, it might appear that
the imposition of a capital profits tax in
Britain might influence a flow of money
to a country like Australia where there
is no tax on capital gains. But if the
company operating out here needs to be
at least 25 p.c. owned by UK parent
under the proposed double tax arrange-
ment, any profits remitted would still
attract tax.


British
Tobacco’s
Report
on 1964
British Tobacco Company (Australia) Limited
Annual Report 1964
The results of 1964, in profits earned and progress made in the company’s long-range plans, could be viewed with
a degree of satisfaction, the Chairman of British Tobacco Company (Australia) Limited, Mr. T. J. N. Foley, said
in his Review of the financial year ended last October 31.
He said it would appear that a sound
foundation had been laid for 1965.
Mr. Foley continued:
British Tobacco Company’s consolidated
profit before taxation, but after providing
£1,057,991 for depreciation, amounted to
£4,77*7,662, for the financial year.
Provision for income tax of £1,768,461 was
made at the increased rate of company tax
imposed by the Commonwealth Government
in the Budget of August last year, leaving
a profit after tax of £3,009,201.
From this a final dividend of 5% on Or-
dinary and “B” Ordinary Stock was declared,
bringing the total dividend for the year to
10%.
An amount of £888,400 was used to increase
the Revenue Reserves and Undistributed Pro-
fits.
“As a component of the profit-after-tax
figure there is an amount of £207,629 arising
as profit on the sale of certain fixed assets
including land and buildings which had been
replaced by new structures and were no
longer required in the company’s operation.”
Arising from the company’s policy of ex-
tending its activities into industry other than
tobacco, various organisation changes in or-
der to control and increase the efficiency of
the new developmental moves had been neces-
sary.
The group structure now consisted of an
administrative and financial headquarters at
British Tobacco Company (Australia) Lim-
ited and a number of manufacturing and
trading companies each conducted as a sep-
arate operating division. Three of these are
subsidiaries of British Tobacco Company:
W. D. & H. O. Wills (Australia) Lim-
ited, cigarette and tobacco manufacturer,
100 per cent owned.
Leigh-Mardon Pty. Limited, printing and
packaging, 60 per cent owned.
Associated Products & Distribution Pty.
Limited, foods and beverages, 51 per
cent owned.
A fourth, American & Foundry
Company (Aust.) Pty. Limited, engineering
and ten-pin bowling, is shared on a 50-50
basis with British Tobacco’s American as-
sociate.
“Bach company has its own Board of Dir-
ectors and works under the executive control
of a different Managing Director.
“The aim is to establish a skilled manage-
ment group for each of these major operating
units and to supply from the central head-
quarters specialist administrative and fin-
ancial help, coupled with a wider view on
policy.”
In his Review, Mr. Foley referred to the
operations of the four companies associated
with British Tobacco.
W. D. & H. O. WILLS (AUSTRALIA)
LIMITED.
Referring to W. D. & H. O. Wills, he
said: “It is obvious that the main prospects
for achieving material increases in overall
company sales must lie in competing with
other manufacturers for a greater share of
the existing Australian market for cigarettes,
tobacco and cigars . . . present indications
are for a considerable degree of success over
the next two years.”
Since the Federal Budget in August, 1964,
there had been a noticeable move towards
lower priced cigarettes, and as a result of
the Excise rise the company had immediately
taken steps to provide a lower priced cigar-
ette of quality in the king size filter segment
of the market.
A new brand, Escort, retailing at 3/ld was
launched towards the end of October in Vic-
toria to measure this demand.
W. D. & H. O. Wills
still largest
In his address to stockholders, Mr.
Foley said by far the greater proportion
of British Tobacco’s earnings came
from the cigarette and tobacco activ-
ities of W. D. & H. O. Wills.
This company would remain one of
the group’s chief interests.
Mr. Foley emphasised that British
Tobacco's expansion into industries
other than tobacco was not an attempt
to retreat from tobacco or to replace
tobacco as an activity of the company.
He added that W. D. & H. O. Wills
was the largest tobacco company in
Australia and at present accounted for
more than 75 per cent of invested funds
of the British Tobacco group.
There was every indication that
W. D. & H. O. Wills would remain the
largest tobacco company in Australia
and would even increase in size, Mr.
Foley said.
LEIGH-MARDON PTY. LTD.
During 1963/64, the complex of printing
and packaging companies within the British
Tobacco group had been consolidated into a
single, closely organised unit under the name
of Leigh-Mardon Pty. Limited.
“Although, because of its origin, Leigh-
Mardon still makes approximately a third of
its sales to the tobacco industry, it is stead-
ily extending its services to other industries
and already has won recognition as an effi-
cient operator in packaging.
“The company is profitable and is now
making an appreciable contribution to the
income of the group.”
ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS AND DIS-
TRIBUTION PTY. LIMITED.
“After very detailed and exhaustive re-
search, the Directors decided early in 1963/
64 that of all commodities, the group most
likely to provide an adequate parallel devel-
opment to tobacco would be a special sel-
ection of foodstuffs and beverages.
“The choice would concentrate on goods
which would require mass production for the
greatest economies, a distribution system to
cater for a large number of retail outlets and
marketing techniques involving mass media
advertising on a widespread basis—all activ-
ities in which the company is widely experi-
enced by virtue of its cigarette marketing
over many years.
“Associated Products & Distribution Pty.
Limited was set up as a new subsidiary com-
pany of British Tobacco Company (Austra-
lia) Limited in order to administer and direct
the operations of the several companies which
it was realised would have to be acquired.
Up to the present, the issued capital of the
new subsidiary is £3,185,000.”
It appeared from the first two months’ re-'
suits of 1964/65 that in the current year
A.P.D., over all its enterprises, would pro-
vide quite a significant share of the year’s
earnings.
AMERICAN MACHINE & FOUNDRY
COMPANY (AUSTRALIA) PTY. LIMITED
A variety of problems continued to beset
this company, not the least of which was the
depressed set of conditions at present being
experienced by the ten-pin bowling industry.
Strong efforts were being made to spread
interest in the sport to a wider market.
In his address to the annual meeting of
stockholders on February 24, Mr. Foley made
these points:—
• The company’s sales of filter tipped cig-
arettes rose again during the financial year
and these sales had been particularly buoy-
ant in the more recent months.
• The increase in demand for Turf and
Capstan filters stimulated by the rise in
excise duty had, in large measure, been
sustained.
• The principal brands in the higher price
filter tip cigarettes—Craven Filter, Country
Life, Kcol and Benson and Hedges—had
all shown sales increases and were main-
taining their growth pattern.
• The new brand, Escort King Size Filter,
had proved a most successful introduction.
• The company had been first to produce
in Australia a triple filter. Under the brand
name of Churchman’s Triple Filter, it had
been introduced to a test market in the
Orange and Bathurst districts of New
South Wales.
® If everything went to plan the company’s
Head Office will have been transferred from
Raleigh Park to Macquarie Street by the
time of the annual meeting next year.
The Head Office building project was sym-
bolic of the progress which the company had
made, and the Directors were confident it
would continue to make, in the commercial
and industrial life of this fast developing
community.
Mr. Foley concluded:—
“We are, as I foreshadowed last year,
advancing on a much broader front than
hitherto.
“With the continued good services and co-
operation of management, staff and employ-
ees, your company is consolidating its
position and making good progress towards
the achievement of its major objectives.
“Your Directors look forward with confid-
ence to further growth accompanied by satis-
factory financial returns in the years ahead.”

Tumbling Yarra Falls
Varra Falls seems certain to omit its
■* ordinary dividend for the second
time since 1921 in the current financial
year. As for 1963-64, no interim will
be paid. The company chalked up a
loss of £104,000 in the December six
months compared with a £63,000 loss
previously. Even allowing for the
seasonal trend which will improve results
to a marked extent in the current six
months, the group can consider itself
lucky if it manages to achieve a profit
of any reasonable dimension for the full
year. Last year’s interim loss was con-
verted to a final profit of £20,000,
equalling 0.8 p.c. on capital.
Moreover, there are more vital com-
mitments to meet than a dividend if a
profit is made. The group owes Felt &
Textiles £300,000 on “extended terms”
after last year’s swap around. At the
end of September £500,000 in unsecured
notes is redeemable (the board is “plan-
ning the availability of funds to meet it”,
so one hopes they were not expecting
profits in the current year to con-
tribute) and extra working capital is
required over the next year or so to
finance the capacity made available by
the acquisition of plant belonging to
Centenary’Mills of Bentleigh (Vic.). At
least this last item may be less of a
problem, as financing is expected to come
“mainly” from cash released now that
tops making has been discontinued.
The recent interim report gave detailed
figures for the first time in the company’s
long history. Unfortunately this gesture
will not give joy to investors. The figures
showed that the loss was after a nil pro-
vision for taxation, whereas the £63,000
loss of the previous half was after tax
of £55,000. So the latest setback is
actually a little worse than appears at
first. Still, there is some consolation in
the fact that directors are not trying to
hide the situation, especially by the
common use of a less than necessary
depreciation provision. Yarra Falls’
figure actually rose £3000 to £120,000
for the half.
The imminent deterioration in profits
this year could well be the third succes-
sive sharp fall. In 1962-63 they dropped
from £263,000 to £194,000, but dividend
was actually lifted from 7 p.c. to 8 p.c.
After last year's slide to £20,000, no dis-
tribution was made.
Brewer Cuts Payment
M/estern Australia’s only brewer,
Sw'an Brewery Co. Ltd, following its
one-for-four bonus issue last year, has
established a 121- p.c. dividend rate, in
line w'ith directors’ forecasts at the time

of the issue. Payments prior to the issue
were 15 p.c.
Directors say better profits were earn-
ed in the latest half-year (the company
balances on March 31 but figures are
not yet available), following an improve-
ment in the first six months.
At 25s., Swan’s 5s. shares currently
yield 3 p.c. on dividend and 3.8 p.c. on
earnings.
Wary Float
Industries is to float to the
public lists soon. The group was
founded in 1950 and produces a wide
range of electrical accessories plus a
variety of plastic products including
houseware, toys and industrial com-
ponents. Around 1,050,000 5s. shares
will be issued at 8s. via the under-
writing partnership of Potter’s and AUC,
which is very nice. Dividends predicted
at 11 p.c. sound even nicer but, until
further facts come to hand, one should
be wary of the profit figures already
released.
According to the directors, profit in
the six months to December last was
£117,000 — the same as for the whole
1963-64 year. This seems a rather
astounding increase and one hopes that
its significance will be qualified when
the prospectus comes out. It will be
easier to believe once an explanation for
the remarkable improvement is furnished.
One can hardly imagine it coming from
sales alone.
Still, even if the record was not as
good as it appears at present, the effect
on market prices should not be very
great. Even if profits remained at the
1963-64 level the predicted dividend
would still be well covered. The half-
year's result is equal to an earning rate
of 31 p.c. calculated over a full year
on the capital-to-be of £750,000.
Directors of the company comprise
two members of the Szental family plus
a Mr N. Jacobsen and a Mr S. N.
Jeffery. The company has about 400
employees.
Sweet Music
lVfusic Houses of Australia Ltd
looks set to create another record
profit in the current financial year and
in anticipation has raised the annual
dividend to a 10 p.c. rate with an in-
terim of 5 p.c. Previous interim was'
4 p.c. to which was added a final 5 p.c.
For the six months ended December the
group sold more than in the previous
corresponding period and, consequently,
profit showed a “satisfactory” improve-
ment.
When interviewed in a recent
Bulletin, executives of the two main
retailing subsidiaries, Nicholson’s and
Palings (Music Houses was formed
by a merger of these two in 1959),
said the musical instrument industry
was experiencing exceptionally buoyant
trading, due mainly to teenage in-
terest in groups such as The Beatles,
club entertainment and an upsurge in
popularity of music as relaxation.
The group’s 5s. shares, available now
for around 7s. 8d., yield 6.5 p.c. from
the higher dividend.
Rising Rowlands
npHE current year should Be another
excellent one for Victorian-based
Rowlands Quarries. Profit in the Decem-
ber half-year jumped from £30,000 to
£43,000. Last year’s full result was
£83,000 after a very buoyant final half.
Performance in this last half of the
current year should be even better.
Quarries at Woodstock and Ballarat lost
money in the first half, but reorganisa-
tion had boosted sales by January and
results should be “satisfactory” by
balance date, according to the directors.
If the year turns out to be as good
as expected, earning rate will see another
healthy boost. Last year’s profit rise
from the 1962-63 figure of £64,000
lifted it from 12.5 p.c. to 15.5 p.c.
Another rise could well warrant an
increase in dividend. The payout has
been 10 p.c. for the last two years. No
interim has been declared for the current
term in order to keep liquidity at a level
which will adequately finance the present
expansion programme. A similar move
was made last year and the 10 p.c. dis-
tribution came entirely as an end-of-the
year payout.
Dividend Aspirations
1%/ff en’s wear retailer, George Wardrop,
has roused shareholders’ dividend
hopes once again. The interim report
announced a £20,000 net profit for the
six months to the end of January, and
directors will consider the possibility of
a payout when the full year’s results are
to hand. The last dividend was 10 p.c.
in 1959-60. Losses of £43,000 and
£38,000 were recorded before 1963-64
turned in a profit of almost £16,000,
equalling 3.7 p.c. on capital.
It is to be hoped that directors are
not raising shareholders’ hopes need-
lessly. Earning rate for the full year will
be lucky to cover a reasonable dividend
to any extent, as profits in the second
half of the year are generally lower.
Back in October, 1962, shareholders
were told that directors were hoping for
a dividend “in the not too distant future”,
but they are still waiting. Nevertheless,
the group’s reorganisation and rejuvena-
tion plan has managed to put it back on
profits.

Timken
bearings
lead a
revolution in
railways
transportation
Something has happened to the railways of the world. They've taken on new
loads, new speeds, and a new outlook as they enter a great new period of
development.
But new loads and new speed require bearings that work well under pressure.
Under ever-increasing load factors. For example, over 170,000 American freight
cars have now been equipped with a railway bearing which averages about
100 million car-miles without being set aside due to overheating between ter-
minals. That is the record established by the Timken "AP” bearing. A tapered
roller bearing, like all Timken bearings. Tapered to take both radial and thrust
loads. Made of steel, high in nickel content, case-hardened for long life.
Timken bearings are playing an important part fighting friction in all industries
today. And the wheels of industry are turning more smoothly, with less main-
tenance, wherever Timken bearings are at work. Timken bearings are made by
the world’s largest and most experienced manufacturer of tapered roller bear-
ings. Australian Timken Pty. Ltd., Ballarat, Victoria. Subsidiary of The Timken
Roller Bearing Company. Timken bearings sold in 116 countries, manufactured
in Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, France, South Africa and U.S.A.

(Inc. in the A.C.T.)
issued by the retailer, it is impossible
to gauge exactly how big the improve-
ments over last year have been. How-
ever, directors did say there had been a
“substantial” improvement in both sales
and profits.
Another FCA Issue
"Finance Corporation of Australia
A is to make its sixth issue to share-
holders in seven years.
The issue will be a one-for-six at par
and has come within a year of the last
issue. Like the others, the amount of
capital raised will be £500,000. This
will lift the total paid capital to £3.5 mil-
lion. The capital of £500,000 with which
the company floated has now been multi-
plied seven times.
To maintain its 40 p.c. shareholding in
the group, The Bank of Adelaide will
lift its interest to £1.4 million. The
bank’s own capital is only £1.75 million
and already almost half of its profits
come from the interest in FCA.
Despite this capital expansion, earn-
ing rates have constantly been kept
above 18 p.c. and the current year will
be no exception. Dividends have always
been 10 p.c.
Footing the Bill
JTn a rather unusual move, the directors
of Johnson Leather have sent a
circular to shareholders to assure them
that the future of the industry is a rosy
one and not as gloomy as some critics
would like them to believe. World
leather demand is growing every year
and they claim that introduction of sub-
"Oh, your qualifications are
eminently satisfactory — it's just
that I'm having trouble fitting you
into the company image!"
stitute materials should not have any
effect. They quote experts as saying
that leather needs in future years will
far exceed the supply and, in actual fact,
substitutes must be developed and used
to bridge this impending gap.
Although the British import sur-
charge temporarily affected the com-
pany’s flow of UK orders, it left no
mark on total export sales. Orders from
overseas have now reached the level
where any further ones cannot be
accepted.
If nothing else, the circular restored a
certain amount of faith in the group.
Last year earning rate was lifted strongly
to more than 18 p.c., and the dividend
was raised from 8 p.c. to 9 p.c., but the
recent interim report spoke of lower
profits in the December half and the
interim dividend was not lifted into
line with last year’s payout, but held at
.3 p.c.
The circular says that all units are
at present working to capacity, and the
December half’s lower profit was due
to abnormal circumstances and that
profits to date are enough to cover an-
other 9 p.c. dividend. The last point
seems to imply that last year’s higher
rate will be maintained in the current
year.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Now Competing with Hotels
Merits of Motels of Australia
/~Vver the last three weeks, these articles
have been concerned with hotel
operators who are established in the Syd-
ney city area and who have no place of
business outside that area. Before ex-
amining the situation in Melbourne, it
will be interesting to take a look at the
company which is probably the largest
provider of accommodation in the Com-
monwealth of Australia Motels of
Australia Ltd.
Motels are a recent development in
Australia. The modern motel probably
didn’t exist at all ten years ago. Today,
the Motels of Australia chain alone con-
sists of more than fifty motels with some-
thing like 1700 “suites”. Generally, it can
be said that motels did not compete with
any one initially, in that they filled a
demand (for accommodation outside of
the capital cities) which previously had
only been met to a limited extent by
country hotels. However, about five
years ago the motel operators became
aware of a wider demand for the type
of accommodation that they supplied in
the capital cities. They filled this
demand by constructing “terminal”
motels.
Motels of Australia Ltd was formed in
November. 1959, to acquire the Gunda-
gai Motel, which had been opened about
12 months at that time, and the Nowra
Motel, then in the course of construction.
By the beginning of the 1961-62 financial
year, the company had 10 motels in
operation and it would seem that these
motels were operating very profitably.
With very little gearing, the earning rate
on ordinary capital had been raised to
16 p.c. There seemed every possibility
that this rate could be increased. How-
ever, one maior and one minor event
occurred which, in retrospect, seem to
have frustrated any prospect of the
16 p.c. earning rate being exceeded.
The minor event was the acquisition of
a lease over the Rushcutter Bay tram
depot. This lease was subsequently trans-
ferred to Rushcutter Ltd and this com-
pany raised capital from the public, al-
though Motels of Australia (in conjunc-
tion with Ten Pin Bowling Ltd) retained
virtual control. The site was developed
with a motel and a bowling centre, both
of which opened in mid-1962. The motel
is managed by Motels of Australia, which
has its offices there, and the bowl is
managed by Ten Pin Bowling. Today,
two and a half years later, the ss. shares
of Rushcutter Ltd are quoted at Is. 2d.
and it can be assumed that this price is at
least an indication of the lack of success
of this particular project.
The major event was the acquisition
of Carapark Holdings Ltd. This takeover
involved the issue of nearly £1,350,000
additional paid capital, considerably
more than the then issued capital of
Motels of Australia, which stood at
£857,931 plus £200,000 in convertible
notes.
The consolidation of the two motel
chains and the disposal of Carapark’s
non-motel activities has been continuing,
but, even at June 30 last, Carapark
Finance had become a subsidiary again
and it would seem that the H. E. Allen
business was still being carried on. Apart
from these activities and those of the
building subsidiary, T. H. O’Connor
(which was acquired by Motels of Aus-
tralia in May, 1960), the group is en-
gaged entirely in the motel industry. In
recent years, the emphasis has been on
the expansion of the number of suites in
“terminal” motels. Probably 50 p.c. of
these suites are now in city motels. There-
fore, to this extent, Motels of Australia
offers direct competition with the older
city hotels.
This leads to the thought that some
comparison might be made with the
motel and hotel operators which have
been considered over recent weeks. The
normal comparison would be the earning
rate on ordinary capital and these rates
have been as follows:
1962 1963 1964
Australia Hotel 5.8 8.1
Hotel Metropole 14.6 15.9 16.3
Wynyard Holdings 3.6 3.3
Motels of Australia 13.5 13.1 13.5
A more critical ratio is available with
a certain amount of approximation in the
return on capital employed. As a matter
of interest this means the land and build-
ings plus other fixed and intangible assets
only, since all these companies operate
with a negative working capital (i.e., cur-
rent liabilities exceed current assets).
1962 1963 1964
Australia Hotel 8.5 9.3 3.7
Hotel Metropole 19.3 17.7 16.5
Motels of Australia 12.4 11.7 13.4
The figures for Wynyard Holdings are
not appropriate because for most of this
period the buildings were under construc-
tion and the business was not related to
the capital invested during this period.
Similar problems arise, but to a lesser ex-
tent, with the other two companies, both
of which have bepn making additions or
renovations to the accommodation which
they offer.
These figures, apart from focusing
attention on Motels of Australia and the
Hotel Metropole, tend to suggest that the
profitability of the hotel has tended
downwards while the profitability of the
motel chain has remained level. The main
problem in making an assessment of the
worth of Motels of Australia’s shares is
to determine the effect on earnings when
the company no longer has any tax losses
available and is required to pay tax at the
full rate. It has been indicated that even
with a 50 p.c. increase in the tax pro-
vision next year, earnings are expected to
increase. Nevertheless, even a 50 p.c. in-
crease would not seem to bring the pro-
vision up to “normal” levels, so a further
increase in tax can be expected in the
following year. All this suggests that any
marked increase in the earning rate can
hardly be expected in the near future,
even if it were not possible that the
business of the Sydney terminal motels
would be affected by the new Qantas
hotel.
However, at current prices between
6s. 9d. and 7s. the shares seem attractive,
with a dividend yield of 7.4 p.c. and an
earnings yield of 10 p.c.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
A Cloud Over Containers
Yet high returns available
A cloud of uncertainty hangs over the
future of Melbourne-based Contain-
ers Ltd. As the accompanying table
shows, earning rates have hardly im-
proved in the current decade. In fact,
there has been a very slight decline in
the last three years.
During this time the mediocre earn-
ings have provided a reasonably healthy
cover for a steady 8 p.c. dividend every
year. So the shares have not fared too
badly, providing an opportunity for
acquiring a steady income via the divi-
dend yield, which has varied over the
A\ p.c. to 5i p.c. range. It now seems
that this era of the company’s history is
rapidly moving to an end.
In the current year to June 30, share-
holders can rely on another 8 p.c. divi-
dend and, once again, a steady or slightly
reduced earning rate. For the six months
to December, a steady interim of 4 p.c.
has been distributed despite a lower pro-
fit. Directors attributed this to the in-
creasing cost of labor and services (sales
actually rose), but pointed out that indi-
cations were for a “comparable” profit
in the full year.
However, 1965-66 will provide a
different and gloomier story. In the
coming December £1.6 million worth of
unsecured notes converts to ordinary
shares. This will boost paid ordinary
capital from £4.7 million to £6.3 million.
Fortunately the shares will only rank for
dividends in the last half of the year.
Such being the case, and if profits did
not improve, earning rate would slip to
11 p.c. and again to 9.8 p.c. in the
following year when a full year’s divi-
dend would be payable on the new
capital. A very narrow cover for the
dividend and one which would not
necessarily warrant its continuation.
As things stand at present, it does
seem as though dividends will go on un-
harmed. Even if profits from normal
trading do not rise by the time the new
shares rank fully, they should see an
increase because of the interest-saving
once the notes are converted. The
amount of saving will be around
£105,000, a figure which would substan-
tially boost profits, although tax would
reduce its beneficial effect to some
extent. Therefore, the dividend will be
safe unless a new raising of loan money
results in a continuance of the interest
bill. Even under these circumstances
the payout could be safe, as the new
loan would be for expansion and pre-
sumably create profit boosts.
So the shares are extremely attractive
at present, though only to the investor
seeking a steady and reliable income.
They offer little else on present indica-
tions. The long-term is clouded, as far
as other benefits are concerned, by the
note conversion and all its implications.
The company was registered in Vic-
toria in November, 1949, to acquire a
controlling interest in a number of pro-
prietary companies in the container in-
dustry. Its best year was 1951-52, when
the earning rate touched a peak of 19.1
p.c. Dividend was lifted to 7 p.c. from
62 p.c. and, in the following year, a
one-for-two issue was made at a pre-
mium of 2s. 6d. There have been only
two issues in the group’s history. The
other was a three-for-ten at par in
1955-56. The closest earning rates have
come to the 1951-52 record was in 1953-
54, at 14.4 p.c. The following year divi-
dend was lifted to 8 p.c. and it has been
there ever since.
Today’s activities are carried out by
three divisions of the parent company
and eight manufacturing subsidiaries.
Six are centred in Victoria and the other
two in NSW. There are also 14 non-
operating subsidiaries. They are com-
panies which have been taken over and
activities transferred to other sections of

Moves are under way to wind them up
now.
The southern can division of the
parent company operates from Mel-
bourne, Sydney, Bathurst (NSW) and
Berri (SA), manufacturing “open top”
cans for canneries and food processors.
The general line group turns out plain
and printed tinplate cans for industrial
packaging and for dry lines such as
talcum powder, from Melbourne, Syd-
ney, Adelaide and Perth. It also handles
aluminium tubes, aerosol cans, valves,
caps and capping machines. The paper
products section has centres in Mel-
bourne, Sydney and Perth. It does
general printing, labels, makes cardboard
boxes and cartons, carton forming and
closing machinery, fibre board tubes and
cans, as well as fibre board bodies with
tinplate ends.
On what might be called the non-
producing side, the parent also runs three
laboratories, two in Melbourne and one
in Sydney. They are engaged primarily
in product research.
The eight manufacturing subsidiaries
make flexible packages: foil and paper
for wraps, pouches and bags; plastic
vials for pharmaceuticals; plastic con-
tainers, components and closures; plastic
bottles, caps and wads; wheelbarrows
(Kelso); hand trucks; clothes-hoists;
studio and greeting cards (Regency);
corrugated and solid fibre containers;
plain and printed tinplate cans; metal
collapsible tubes; garden tools, and also
operate as printers. Another activity is
the laminating and extrusion coating of
films.
This somewhat exhausting list should
convey that the larger part of production
is manufactured from tinplate. In recent
years the company has packaging fields
complementary to that of metal cans,
because markets existed or could be seen
in the future. In some cases of exten-
sion by takeover, the group has only
just reached the stage where integration
and reorganisation will start to pay off
in the form of higher profits.
An improvement might have come in
the 1963-64 year had it not been for two
factors. Intense and growing competi-
tion in the industry was one. The other
was a severe decline in profitability in
the paper and rigid plastic field. Little
can be done about the former, but a
reorganisation of personnel and plant is
expected to rectify the latter by the end
of the current financial year.
Although the figures may not show it,
Containers is a creative and forward-
looking company. Its awards for de-
sign and packaging are by no means
few. One of the many reasons for this
is the policy adopted to keep abreast with
overseas developments. The group acts
as the Australian associate of the Conti-
nental Can Co. (USA) and the Metal
Box Co. (UK) and is constantly sending
technical officers overseas to examine
latest ideas and developments.
There are few company chairmen who
probe so deeply into future products for
the shareholders as Mr J. H. Kirkhope.
In the last annual report he said Austra-
lian tinplate specifications were at present
adequate for the demands of the market.
However, . . during the past three to
four years much attention has been given
overseas to the use of . . . lightweight
tinplate, that is, having a substance or
thickness less than the main products
available from BHP. While this light-
weight tinplate is intended to permit
reductions in the selling prices of cans,
it is not yet commercially available from
the Australian mill at Port Kembla.
“Publicity has also been given to the
introduction overseas of . . . the ‘easy
opening’ can for beverages, where at
least one end is aluminium —scored for
ease of tear-off —and a can-opener is not
needed. Those . . . are more costly than
standard cans . . . and although they
have found great acceptance in the USA,
even in that country a substantial de-
mand still remains for the standard can.
“Aluminium is used by us in the
manufacture of extruded collapsible and
rigid tubes and in the form of foil as
a laminate in flexible packaging. We
expect to participate in the growing
range of products in which this metal
will be used.”
The accompanying table illustrates the
solid financial position. Working capi-
tal is lower, yet still appears to be suffi-
cient to finance operations. Ordinary
capital has been virtually steady, while
reserves have maintained constant
growth. Of the preference capital,
£500,000 is redeemable at a 2s. 6d. pre-
mium between June and December,
1971. The lower loan capital is a

healthy trend considering fixed asset
growth (there was a revaluation in 1960)
and indicates that expansion has been
mainly financed from internal resources.
Of course the interesting feature is
the drop in current assets and liabilities
in the 1962 year. Stocks were curtailed
in anticipation of a full range of tinplate
from BHP and in view of the depressed
state of the economy at the beginning of
the year. The figures jumped back with
a vengeance in 1963. Directors found
that electrolytic tinplate only was being
supplied and customers had to be pro-
vided with the opportunity of buying
cans of either hot-dipped of electrolytic
tinplate. A clear pattern of demand was
expected to emerge and seems to have
done so, judging by the stock adjust-
ments made in the latest year.
The substantial growth in fixed assets
reflects the group’s expansion and diver-
sificatlon. Mr Kirkhope is one of the
many leaders of secondary industry who
believe that depreciation should be de-
ductible on buildings as well as the other
types of fixed assets. The Government’s
attitude differs from those in the UK, the
USA and New Zealand. Containers
makes no specific provision for the item
but has “reserves, substantial in amount,
to meet any loss in the value of buildings
affected by obsolescence and deteriora-
tion.
HUNT BROS (HOLDINGS) LTD
Struggling for Old Status
Shareholders of Hunt Bros (Holdings)
Ltd can have received little en-
couragement from the recent interim
report of directors, which disclosed a
sharp fall in profit and a cut in the
interim dividend rate.
Directors attributed the 52 p.c. fall in
profit in the six months to December to
extremely keen competition, for the
volume of vehicles sold showed only a
5 p.c. decline on that of the correspond-
ing period of the previous year.
Hunt Bros is one of the major Ford
vehicle resellers in the Sydney metro-
politan area and recently extended its
activities to Canberra.
Latest official figures show the number
of Fords sold in the first 10 months of
1964 registering only a fractional de-
cline on that of the corresponding
period of the previous year, so the
troubles cannot all be blamed on the
selling of new cars, although the crea-
tion of additional dealerships and the
multiplicity of the Ford range would
not make this the easiest of businesses.
Hunt Bros has held a Ford franchise
in the Sydney area since 1921. The
present company did not come into being
until mid-1950, when 200,000 ss. shares
were placed with the public at par.
Shareholders of Hunt Bros have par-
ticipated in three cash issues since flota-
tion—a one-for-one in 1950, a one-for-
four in 1957, and a one-for-three in
1960. Paid-up capital now stands at
£469,889, all in ordinary shares.
The new funds raised, and the sale
of the finance subsidiary in 1960, saw a
dramatic change in the composition of
the accounts for the 1961 year. Trade
debtors of £1.4 million (including
£217,332 in unearned income) in the
1960 year shrank to a mere £75,452 in
1961. In the same period an overdraft
of £176,589 was converted to a cash
surplus of £101,260, while deposits of
£563,392 and debentures of £202,900
were retired.
This marked the recent high point of
the company’s liquidity. In each year
since, working capital has shown a
marked decline. Bank overdraft has
risen to £275,216, while in the current
12 months the company has been faced
with the repayment of a mortgage of
£56,000.
To meet the drain on funds, the com-
pany has gradually liquidated invest-
ments in listed companies, which at
June 30 last totalled £46,377 —just on
half the figure of £90,337 which
appeared in the accounts two years
earlier.
Much of the additional borrowings
went into fixed assets, reflecting the
opening of new premises, principally for
the sale of used cars. Freehold rose
from £638,417 in 1962 to £684,472 last
year, while last year leasehold stood at
£174,268.
Peak profit year was in 1960, when
earnings totalled £68,139, equal to 22.2
p.c. on capital. The following year, be-
cause of the credit squeeze, earnings
tumbled to £40,214, equal to 9.2 p.c.
on higher capital. Dividend was cut
from I2i p.c. to 8 p.c.
Profit gradually recovered to £59,989
in 1963 (12.8 p.c.), but last year tumbled
to £37,079 (7.9 p.c.), which failed to
cover the 8 p.c. dividend requirement by
£512.
At present the shares are selling
below 35., at which level they appear
fully priced on present indications.

SPECULATOR'S DIARY
A Tense Financial Adventure
Still a bear market
ITaving more than an idle interest in
Channel 10, I was one of the viewers
of the “independent” station on its open-
ing night the other Monday. Indepen-
dent of what? Viewers certainly gained
the impression that it had strong links.
Now that it’s open (eight months
after its sister channel in Melbourne) it
has a difficult task ahead of it. In fact,
I couldn’t sum it up better than Sir
Robert Menzies who described it as a
“financial adventure”. In the meantime
the share price is adjusting itself to a
sensible level. At 95., I’m more than
past my break-even point with the put
option.
The market has behaved well with
most of my investments going in the
right direction. One of the downs is Mt
Isa, whose share price slipped another
6d. Now that the strike is finally over,
Mt Isa will probably drop out of the
news until the current year’s loss is an-
nounced late this year. So I’ll play it
out for another week or so, working on
the assumption that the market has
exhausted itself.
The Only disappointment in the port-
folio this week was Tableland Tin. But,
then I can hardly complain as 200 shares
were sold last week at 365. 6d. The fall
in Tableland Tin is in the opposite
direction to the movement of the world
price of tin. Now that this price is up
to the £l4OO sterling level, my attention
swung over to another Australian tin
stock which, up until this year, had the
unlikely name of Loloma (Fiji) Gold
Mines.
The name was a carry-over from the
old days when the company operated a
very profitable gold mine in Fiji. It
ceased operations as a gold miner in
the mid-’fifties, and for the last decade
has depended on its investment income
to pay its liberal dividends/
It is only now that the company is
re-entering the mining industry. A tin
mining programme in the Herberton-
Irvinebank area of North Queensland is
being implemented following extensive
investigations in that area. The first
alluvial treatment plant at Stannary
Hills is expected to be working by the
middle of this year, and it is possible
that a second plant will be operating
early in 1966.
The present one-for-four issue at 15s.
is to finance this programme. Only 6d.
application is due on April 12, so, even
after the 1000 rights I purchased at
2s. 6d. are taken up, the outlay will be
only a little more than £l5O.
A .similar sum was required for the
purchase of 500 Ferris Industries at 6s.
Like most other industrial shares, its
price is well down from its peak this
year. Like so many other industrials, the
price fall follows in the wake of an
excellent interim report.
Profits for the first six months rose
more than 20 p.c., and the interim divi-
dend was increased from 4 p.c. to 43 p.c.
A continuation of this performance
should see the earning rate for the full
year over 20 p.c.
Apparently it’s not only the car radios
that are boosting the revenue but also
Channel Master TV aerials, television
receivers and tele-components. Adding
that small touch of glamor to the stock
is its recent move into the manufacture
of advanced electronic equipment.
On the elimination side of the port-
folio I was forced to cover the 500
Boral at 255. 6d. As I fear it’s still a
bear market, I thought I might recover
the few pounds loss by shorting 500
R. & N. Statham rights at ss. 9d. Un-
fortunately, droughts and farm equip-
ment do not mix!

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Primary Producers and Costs
Digesting Mr McEwen’s warning
fpHE Minister for Trade, Mr McEwen,
sent a chill down the spines of pri-
mary producers throughout Australia
when he mentioned the matter of costs in
his speech opening the recent annual con-
ference of the Graziers’ Association of
NSW. His brief remarks on costs almost
overshadow the not entirely unexpected,
but nevertheless significant, decision of
the conference not to oppose (totally)
the Australian Wool Board’s reserve
price recommendation.
Certainly the NSW Graziers have not
said that they endorse the reserve price
plan but they did reject, by a close vote,
a motion stating opposition in clear
terms.
As the stronghold of the opposition
to the plan to date, the NSW Graziers’
decision is being interpreted as meaning
in many quarters, particularly in Vic-
toria, that the plan will go to a referen-
dum towards the end of this year.
That decision will be made by the
Wool Industry Conference in April.
Much will depend on the Conference’s
attitude to the version of the plan recom-
mended by Federal Cabinet (basically
that the woolgrower underwriting be in-
creased to £3O million and the Govern-
ment share reduced to £5O million). By
the end of this year the problem of rising
costs in the wool industry, and in all
other primary industries, may well have
an overbearing effect on grower opinion.
Mr McEwen said the “historical ap-
proach to stability of costs, that Gov-
ernment policy should be designed to
avoid cost increases for the all-important
wool industry, is no longer viable.
“The last great effort by the Govern-
ment to contain costs practically put the
Government out of office in 1961”, he
added. “The most important thing is to
make an effort to get unit costs down
even though cash costs go up.” These
remarks did not take long to sink in.
Primary producers can claim, in truth,
that they are the only section of the Aust-
ralian community that has managed to
increase output per man and output per
unit in the face of the inflationary spiral.
True, they have had a good deal of
Government help in the form of tax-
ation benefits, stabilisation schemes for
most primary products, and subsidies on
some products.
But if there is a marked upward in-
flationary trend now—and most people
would agree it is highly likely—then the
primary producers may not be able to
cope. The strong likelihood of drought
or near drought, a lower wool cheque
and difficulty perhaps in selling wheat
overseas will aggravate their costs prob-
lem.
At the annual meeting of the Vic-
torian Wheat and Woolgrowers’ Asso-
ciation in Melbourne, soon after the Gra-
ziers’ Association meeting in NSW, one
speaker made a plea for a “five years*
wage freeze agreement between the Gov-
ernment and the unions”. This is the
more noteworthy because, by traditional
links, the Victorian Wheat and Wool-
growers’ Association is a lot closer to
union sentiment than the Graziers’ As-
sociation of NSW, or of any other State.
It’s almost the same as a speaker at
a Graziers’ Association meeting advoca-
ting that the members seek affiliation
with the Trades Hall Council. It’s
altogether out of character, yet it hap-
pened, and the speaker in question got a
good hearing. He added the rider that
the Government, in turn, ask business
people and manufacturers not to put up
the prices.
It sounds a most logical step, yet men
are rarely governed by logic and there’s
precious little hope of such a wage freeze
coming into existence.
The Victorian conference did not
adopt the wage freeze idea as a firm
motion but decided to request a top-
level conference in Canberra between
the parliamentary parties, industrial or-

ganisations and primary producers. It
also decided to protest against any in-
crease in duty on Japanese cars and
trucks, which are being bought these
days by many farmers.
Significantly, very little of the com-
ment on costs is critical of Mr McEwen
himself. It would be fair to say that
both Mr McEwen and the Minister for
Primary Industry, Mr Adermann, are
popular amongst farmers generally. This
does not mean they always get the red
carpet, but they do not get booed either.
In politics only dictators should expect
manifestations of universal popularity.
Some critics of Mr McEwen and the
Government have interpreted his re-
marks on costs as an implied threat
that the farmer must go along with the
Government' regardless, or accept the
Labor alternative. Now, if Labor could
show that it could beat the cost pro-
blem, then it might have a chance of
winning back those farmers who form-
erly voted Labor but who, in the decade
of plenty since the war, have lost their
old affiliation.
Labor, however, on the evidence avail-
able, would have difficulty convincing
many that it has a costs policy at all.
The almost catastrophic state of the
British dairy industry in the short months
since the Wilson Labor Government
came into office, would not help Labors
cause in this country.
But, if Mr McEwen’s remarks on costs
were a sober and realistic warning, they
likewise lacked the venom of Country
Party attitudes to costs —within the CP
itself at State level.
The following, penned by Country
Party stalwart Mr W. L. Moss, will pro-
bably be echoed by the majority of farm-
ers regardless of where and how they
lodge their votes: “From the earliest days
of industry in Australia the industrialist
and his workers have, until recently, not
even considered it incumbent upon
themselves to develop an export industry.
They have lived the sheltered life of
protected workers and industrialists.
“To be critical, they have been earn-
ing a living by taking in each other’s
washing and, for good measure, skim-
ming off as much as they can of the
earned increment of the primary produ-
cer. About 85 p.c. of Australian exports,

Liveweight Selling of Cattle
Another unified farmer approach
TS/hile farmer organisations continue to
" differ on some big issues, there is
quite a deal of unified activity going on
which gives the lie to the theory that
farmers can never agree. Eventually the
big issues may be resolved and real
farmer unity become a reality.
Currently a unified committee rep-
resenting the major organisations is
examining the sale of cattle by liveweight.
At present cattle are sold either private-
ly or in the auction ring on the “judge-
by-eye” method. The great majority
would go through the auction ring,
although private arrangements between
farmers and the big butchers is said to
be on the increase.
Liveweight selling is commonplace in
Britain, the US, Canada and most Euro-
pean countries. The obvious advantage,
to the farmer, is that he has a better idea
of what his cattle are worth. It should
follow that the buyer also has a better
idea of what he is buying. If this is so it
remains a fact that buyers generally in
Australia seem to prefer to judge them
by eye.
The cynic would say that the buyer,
being more expert at this judging by eye,
prefers this system because it gives him
an edge. Yet a couple of buyers have
been honest enough to admit that they
get fooled sometimes, too.
In the old days it was different. Beef
cattle were either Shorthorns or Here-
fords. Most came into the ring as bul-
locks straight off natural grass. A good
man could estimate the weight to within
a few pounds.
Today, to the Herefords and Short-
horns have been added Angus, Murray
Greys, Santas and Devons of all ages,
coming off a variety of natural, semi-
improved and improved pastures. Crosses
of these animals with each other and
with dairy breeds (notably Friesian) add
to the number of types.
Ages, too, make a difference. At 15 to
18 months the breed characteristics are
not so visible.
Buyer opposition to liveweight selling
may be expected to lessen with the pass-
ing of time. A long time, some would say.
What may hasten the acceptance of live-
weight selling, however, is the discovery
by this unified committee of farmers that
there is a side benefit to liveweight selling
which, until now, has not been generally
realised in this country.
In the overseas countries, when live-
weight selling was introduced, it was
noticed that the influence of the major
market as an influencing factor on prices
diminished. The weight of the beast be-
came the one, simple, determining factor
(aside from breed and age, naturally).
In Australia, at present, it is the major
market in each State which sets the price
trend. If there is a sudden slump in prices
at Newmarket, in Melbourne, or Home-
bush, in Sydney, this is reflected in prices
at markets all over Victoria and NSW.
When there is a sudden upswing at New-
market or Homebush, the reverse hap-
pens.
Dealers, as distinct from buyers, doubt-
less relish the fluctuations triggered off by
Newmarket and Homebush. Then, many
dealers have been complaining that the 1
trend to baby beef has restricted the scope
of their operations over the last few years.
If liveweight selling does come in, and
it seems a matter of time, the dealer will
probably become a finisher and con-
ditioner of cattle.

Getting Wheat to the Seaboard
Engineers talk about pipelines
the wheat from Austra-
lia’s wheat-growing areas to the sea-
board is probably the biggest single prob-
lem confronting the industry. In a way
it is the same problem as selling the
wheat. If a cheaper and more efficient
method of transport could be found then
the price, naturally, could be reduced.
Apart from a very minor percentage,
which goes by road, the wheat crop is
transported by rail. The NSW Railways
and the Victorian Railways carry the
major share and it strains each system to
the utmost. All told, they do a pretty
good job. Despite shortcomings insuf-
ficient trucks and too many obsolete
trucks the wheat is moved more
cheaply than anywhere else in the world.
Now a revolutionary method of
moving wheat has been suggested a
wheat pipeline. The idea has been around
for some months, though it has not been
taken too seriously. It sounds a bit far-
fetched: the sort of thing that may come
into being in fifty years’ time but not
now.
At the recent annual conference of the
Victorian Wheat and Woolgrowers’ As-
sociation a member of the Australian
Wheat Board, Mr E. E. Nuske, revealed
that an Australian engineering firm had
approached him with the idea of financ-
ing and building wheat pipelines. This
makes the whole thing just a little more
concrete than something borrowed from
science fiction.
Mr Nuske is well known in the wheat
industry and was a member of the most
recent delegation which visited Red
China. He said that he was convinced the
pipeline idea was worth investigating. It
should, he said, be discussed with the
United States agricultural attache in Can-
berra to see if information could be ob-
tained about any American research into
the same idea.
Pipelines in the United States are a big
thing. The nation is criss-crossed with
them. They carry water, oil, petrol,
natural gas, and even coal. All these
things, with the exception of coal, are
liquids.
Coal can be moved through a pipeline
because it will float in water. It is granu-
lated, the granules are washed along the
pipe and the water is run off at the ter-
minal.
It you simply mixed wheat with water
and tried to pump it through a pipe, you
would end up with a soggy mess. This is
the problem which has to be overcome
before a wheat pipeline can become a
reality.
The man who comes up with the per-
fect answer may carve a niche for himself
in history. Apparently a number of
methods are being tried to find the
answer.
One is that the wheat should be first
sprayed with a light coating of plastic,
which would permit it to float, unharmed,
in water. When the pipeline finally deli-
vers it at the wheat terminal on the
seaboard, this plastic could be washed off
with a dissolving solution.
Another method would be to pack the
wheat in plastic sacks, which would fit
inside the pipeline and which would be
carried along like so many small boats
inside the water-filled pipe.
Yet another method envisages break-
ing down the wheat into flour in the
country areas. This flour could then be
mixed with water and the pasty fluid
piped to the seaboard, where the mois-
ture content would be removed.
These are methods which the engineers
refer to as hydrostatic piping because
they all involve the use of water. Other
ideas involve dry-conveyancing, that is,
moving wheat along a vast pipeline with-
out the use of water. Obviously this
would involve some moving agent
either compressed air, a series of mech-
anically operated belts, or a continuously
moving auger. Atomic power may, one
day, be utilised.
The natural reaction is that any of
these things are way off. Yet it should
be remembered that only 15 years ago the
wheat crop was handled in bags, where-
as today it is increasingly bulk handled.
Fifteen years ago there were farmers, and
economist types, who rejected bulk hand-
ling as just another far-fetched idea.
More than one regional wheat commit-
tee of farmers actually resisted contri-
buting funds to building bulk storage
because they were convinced nothing
would come of it.
So, on that score, there's no need to
be too quick in decrying this idea of a
wheat pipeline.
It would be a tremendous boon if
someone in this country could make the
idea a reality. It would be not so good if
someone in the United States, Canada or
France got in first.
Once a wheat pipeline comes into
existence in any country it will be
copied. But the country which produces
it first will have an extremely good wheat
year and will probably line up export
contracts for a number of years ahead.
Prizes for Rabbits
A £5000 Gift
A retired company director, Mr John
F. Hughes, has given £5OOO to en-
courage Victorian hill farmers to eradi-
cate rabbits, noxious weeds and other
vermin. “With a bit of luck the fund
might be substantially increased,” he said
when announcing his gift. The Victorian
Department of Lands will run competi-
tions and will award prizes every two
years.
Initially the competition will be restric-
ted to the counties of Buln Buln, Mor-
nington, Heytesbury and Polwarth in
Victoria, areas which are hilly and which
have serious rabbit problems. Prizes of
£l5O will be given.
Mr Hughes has owned several farms
in his day and was at one time secretary
of the Taxation Department. He was
born on a farm at Learmonth in Victoria
and has had first-hand experience of the
damage caused by rabbits, noxious weeds
and vermin. “A hill farmer can be put
back three years by neglecting rabbit and
blackberry control for just six months,”
he said.
As far as is known, this is the first
time in Australia that any public-spirited
citizen has given money for this
kind of competition. It is certainly the
first time it has happened in Victoria. It
is a most worthwhile gesture and Mr
Hughes deserves to be congratulated.
