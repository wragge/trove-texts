The Injustice Done to Mr. Slyme
Regarded as an instructor of the young,
Dickens, though the reverse of snobbish, left
much to be desired. He almost entertained
a dislike for successful industry, so he
painted the men who practised it in a variety
of unpleasant tints. A feature of his works
is the parasitic character of the heroes.
Some of them certainly did' toil, but with
limited success. Some loafed frankly upon
relatives. Some waited for dead women’s
shoes or dead men’s boots, and got into the
habit of having money left to them.
Daniel Quilp, of “The Old Curiosity
Shop,” made his wealth, which was large,
by his own exertions. Sampson Brass and
his sister Sally made their wealth, whatever
it might amount to, by personal, though
sometimes dishonest, effort. They all
ended badly, pursued by the loathing of then-
creator. On the other hand, Richard Swivel-
ler developed into some kind of a hero, chiefly
because he lived first on a live female rela-
tive and then on a dead one.
Three characters in “Nicholas Nickleby”
occur to me as men who led the independent
financial life and fought their own battles.
They were Ralph Nickleby, who hanged him-
self ; Arthur Gride, who died by violence;
and Wackford Squeers, who was lost seen
in gaol. They made a loathsome but solvent
trio. The author saw to the loathing.
Nicholas himself was a tall, pure epitome
of romance, and his one notable success lay
in inheriting his uncle’s pile. A case which
presents some features of resemblance is that
of David Copperfield, who depended a great
deal, and for a very long period, on his aunt.
The story made no such provision for Murd-
stonc. who toiled in the wine industry,
though he supplemented his income by mar-
riage with rich women; and Uriah Heep had
not only to struggle with Fate single-handed
but to provide for mother, who was ’umblc.
He provided for mother amid the concen-
trated hatred of all hands and the cook.
Even the repute of the gallant soldier of
Scripture has been turned into modified scorn
because Mr. Heep was named after him
2000-odd years later.
An outstanding parasite was Pip, the
youth who was blessed with “Great Expec-
tations.” He lived for prosperous years on
an allowance which came anonymously from
a hard-working ticket-of-leave man who pos-
sessed a life sentence in N.S.W. It may or
may not have been to Pip’s credit that he
believed the money came anonymously from
a partially-mad spinster who lived in a dark
room until she took fire and died or blew
up. Another bright young hero with a less
happy climax was Richard Car stone of
Bleak House.” He. was the complete non-
supporter, and was obviously designed to
live on the bounty of the elderly hero, sunny
John .Tarndyce. John Jarndyce inherited
his riches, otherwise he wouldn’t have been
sunny* The strenuous and self-dependent
worker of the volume was solicitor Vholes.
He was much respected in the profession
and supported not only himself but an aged
father and three daughters. The novelist’s
dislike of Vholes almost amounted to mania
. J n some other novels the habitual moral
is incomplete, either for want of the helpless
young hero or because he doesn’t inherit
enough money from a sufficiently bad old
relative. But “Martin Chuzzlewit” is in a
category by itself Outstanding characters
include the following:—
Martin Chuzzlewit, senior, who was exceedingh
affluent but wasn’t seen doing any work, nor was
it mentioned that he had ever done any. It is
assumed that he inherited his wealth. Therefore
though bad-tempered and suspicious, he was really
a fine character.
His brother Anthony and nephew Jonas. Thev
were rich, but they toiled as Manchester warehouse-
men in a back street. Consequently they were as
vile as they could be, excepting Jonas, who was
viler, being an unsuccessful parricide among other
things, and aiming to kill his young wife for the
insurance.
Montague Tigg, who began the book in dire poverty
but built his own fortunes on the basis of a
fraudulent insurance company. He was a humorous
creature, but Dickens never forgave him for building
his own fortunes. He should have had the insurance
concern left to him.
Seth Pecksniff, who made his way in the world
as an architect and estate agent. He was a good
father and a law-abiding citizen, and no specific
act of his fully justifies the abuse lavished on him.
Martin Chuzzlewit the younger, whose most notable
qualification for being a hero was that he was not in
any sense a self-supporting institution. His obvious
mission in life was to have money left or given to
him.
Two other heroes, of whom one, Mark Taplcy,
was obviously meant to be provided for by marriage
with a prosperous public-house. The other, Thomas
■Pinch, was left with the asset of a rich brother-in-
iaw, it being about the only thing which could bo
lone for a man of his saintly incapacity. The
brother-in-law had had money left to him.
Among all these stands out the unique figure
Chevy Slyme. He was a character who
made Ins dead self a stepping-stone to higher
things. Possibly Dickens drew the reformed
man by mistake, and passed on in too great
r. a , !™ r Ilc was just preparing to ruin
Pecksniff) to realise what he had done.
Chevy Sl.vine began life with a small property
and no profession, and when he had ex-
hausted the former his descent was precipi-
tous. lie may have fallen among bad eom-
lanu s. In the early part of the book ho
s described with venom:—
, . "Egg returned with a companion shorter than
himself, who was wrapped in an old blue camlet
cloak with a lining of faded scarlet
He was brooding over the remains of yesterday’s
decanter of brandy, and was engaged in the. thought-
nil occupation of making a chain of rings on the
op of the table with the wet foot of his drinking-
glass He retained nothing of his old self but
ns boastfulness and his bile, and seemed to’have
no existence separate and apart from his friend
Tigg. And now so abject and so pitiful was he-
at once so maudlin, insolent, beggarly and proud
that even his friend and parasite, standing erect
beside him, swelled into a Man by contrast...
“I swear,” cried Mr. Slyme, giving the table an
imbecile blow with his fist and then feebly leaning
his head upon his hand, while drunken drops oozed
from his eyes, “that I am the wretchedest creature
on record. Society is in a conspiracy against me.
I’m the most literary man alive. I’m full of scholar-
ship. I’m full of information. I’m full of genius.
I’m full of novel views on every subject.... Tigg,
I take you to witness that I am the most persecuted
hound on the face of the earth.”
With a whine, not unlike the whine of the animal
he named in its lowest state of humiliation, he
raised his glass to his mouth again....
Then after some more drinks :
Mr. Slyme, of too haughty a stomach to work,
to beg, to borrow or to steal, yet mean enough to
be worked or begged, borrowed or stolen for, too
insolent to lick the hand that fed him in his need,
yet cur enough to bite and tear it in the dark—
with these closing words Mr, Slyme fell forward
with his head upon the table, and so declined into
a sodden slumber.
It seems unlikely (or impossible) that even
a young man who had sunk to these depths
could rise again, especially with a heavy-
weight enemy like Dickens sitting on his
head to keep him down, and more especially
as his friend Tigg left him to shift for him-
self and founded, his fraudulent insurance
office. But there were recuperative forces
and springs of character in Chevy Slyme
such as no other Dickensian figure pos-
sessed. He became a London policeman—a
part which requires a frame not wasted
by excess (possibly his drinkings were exag-
gerated out of malice), honesty, intelligence,
sobriety, industry and unflinching courage!
His rise was phenomenal. Shortly after the
whining episode above mentioned the hero,
Martin Chuzzlewit, junior, went abroad, re-
turning in a year to cadge from his grand-
father. Some little time later (apparently
a few months later) it became advisable to
arrest Jonas Chuzziewit, of the Manchester
warehouse, for the murder of Tigg, and
Slyme, already an officer, was in charge of
the arresting party. He proved efficient,
honest and humane. When the wretched
Manchester warehouseman pressed 100
sovereigns on him provided he was allowed to
g’o into the next room and cut his throat,
Slyme only took the money on condition that
the wretched sinner would first “say a prayer,
now, or something of that sort.” A mis-
sionary could have done no more. Later,
when he found that Jonas had neither prayed
nor cut his throat, he returned the money,
though under no obligation to do so. And
later still, when Jonas really committed
suicide in the cab on the way to gaol, he
didn’t loot the £lOO from the corpse, as a
baser man would have done, but left it for
the widow. _ She was Pecksniff’s daughter,
and the policeman owed Pecksniff no grati-
tude.
Slyme doubtless rose to be Chief Com-
missioner, or attained even higher honor.
But regarded as a man who climbed out of
the pit of degradation by his own unaided
efforts he should meanwhile have been ele-
vated to the position of a hero, and had
money left to him.
JAMES EDMOND.
A Bluegum Boswell
It seems a pretty safe bet that bush-
dwellers of Australia, on the basis' of num-
bers, lead the world as scribblers. The
Bulletin’s Abo. pages shout evidence on
this point. So do the Answers to Corres-
pondents. _ In my time out back one rarely
dropped into a circle which did not con-
tain someone who “wrote for the paper.”
Personally, I don’t credit The Bulletin
with causing so much as fostering this defi-
nite and widespread epidemic of cacoethes
scribendi. The virus lies in the land itse f
—in its freedom, its spaciousness, its milt -
ness of climate, and, perhaps above all, i
the fascination of its extraordinary bird
mammals, reptiles and flora.
Consider the case of Morland Welmai
author of Billy Bluegum’s Letters to th
Dead Dingo Dodger and ’Possum Point Pos
(Edwards, Dunlop). Back on his selectio
.Morland Welman answers to a much mor
workaday name; lie is a veteran bush-bache
lor who lias dug into a quiet corner o ’
Queensland. As a lad he had nine months
schooling; now he is much better read than
the average public man. From his bus!
retreat four or five years ago, when I wa
conducting a Nature column in a Brisban
journal, and the fight to save Teddy the Bea
was going forward, the virile hatter sent m
numerous paragraphs, telling of the life o
the Avild things about him and pleading fo
their salvation. That was the time Queens-
land Avas achieving the unsavory record or
killing off over a million native-bears in one
season, probably to have their pelts figure ii
American sales as “wombat” skins. The
carnage appalled the old man, and he began
to plead for Billy in a series of “Bluegum
Letters.” Writing was out of the question
at night after a hard day’s toil, and dinner-
cooking on top of it. This booklet, therefore
Avas scribbled at 3 and 4 o’clock in mornings
spread over the best part of two years—an
example of candle-light doggedness that
makes the drawing-room stick-at-it-iveness
of your Arnold Bennetts look very small
potatoes. Dogged did it, too, in the matter
of publication. Bad health and worse luck
had left the solitary scribbler no cash for
ambitious flights, and he was faced with the
prospect of scrapping the MS. or selling his
selection —the sunny corner which he had
planned to leave for convalescent-hospital
purposes and as a sanctuary for birds and
animals. As a compromise he sought to
mortgage. The bank’s reply was that it
would advance money for the purchase of
stock, but not for the printing of books The
Boswell of the Bears thought hard. Then
he locked his cabin and Avent forth as a free-
lance Avith an axe. That was hoAV “Blue-
gum's Letters” got into print—with the cash
derived from clearing potential banana-farms
of lantana.
As for the matter of the booklet, it offers
observations on the' Asiatic menace, solar
systems, immigration, godliness, local patriot-
ism, Queensland politics, education, arbitra-
tion courts, Norman Lindsay, Sydney, etc.,
all blended with the domestic affairs of koalas
and acknowledgments of the charm of the
lush. The author is a recluse still, and I
know him only by correspondence; but that

NO KNOCKING
THE most important quality
of motor spirit is its “anti-
knocking” capacity. “Knocking”
necessitates easing the com-
pression, by retarding the
“spark,” when increased pulling
power is most needed—as when
climbing a hill-with the result
that the power capacity of
the engine is thereby reduced.
Shell Motor Spirit possesses
natural non-pinking properties
which enable the fullest use to
be made of an open throttle
and advanced spark, without
“knocking.” Try Shell out on
the hills. It has greater pulling
powe r—quicker acceleration—
and gives more miles per gallon.

he is a man of pluck and intelligence and a

A. H. CHISHOLM.
Venus’s Penny-dreadful
It was apparently the noise over the necro-
philia of Joyce’s “Ulysses” that prompted
Frank Hams to produce “My Life and
Loves.” And this blotchy progeny is what
would be expected as the issue of Harris,
the Apostle of Pitiful Humanity, and Joyce,
that shorthand reporter in a brothel, suffer-
ing from aphasia. 1 therefore enter my
protest against R. S. Ellery’s article (R.P.
3/9/’25) praising Harris’s book as a frank
sex-revelation. For it reveals much less
about sex than, say, an analysis of the vari-
ous modulations and key-changes in the
second act of “Tristan and Isolde” reveals
of the music. The .comparison is exact,
for the whole of that act, up to the raucous
awakening of the betraying horns, is one
shifting heaven of climbing caresses. Harris’s
book is written in a style somewhere between
those ridiculous mock-epistles purporting to
be composed by a bride after her wedding-
night for a girl friend, which we have all
read at school behind the gymnasium with
furtive delight, and Walt Whitman’s pass-
ages describing sex-acts, in which the capa-
city of the American lingua franca for mak-
ing ordinary English words attain a pecu-
liarly loathsome aesthetic effect is to be
found at its worst. Such efforts at realism
hover between humor and ugliness, and in
neither case convey the dimmest sensation
of the actual event. It is not likely that
anyone will accuse me of suffering from im-
pulses of puritanism or shame. In fact, it
has been publicly announced that there are
not enough people afflicted by satyriasis and
nymphomania in Australia to form an audi-
ence for my work, that my verses, if scribbled
on the walls of a wayside pub, would shock
shearers (so innocent are critics), and that
I am a dungbeetle. These questions are mat-
ters of opinion, I hope; but, at least, they
should constitute me uo mean authority on
literary lewdness. And I consider Frank
Harris’s tome of painfully elaborated detail
is not worth the paper (incidentally, some
very cheap German stuff) on which it is
printed, and that its value as frankness is
nil if it is not actively a deterrent, from free
revelation of emotion.
Harris makes the mistake that the sexual
act is the sexual fact, instead of realising
that it is merely an expression, however
necessary an expression, of desire’s eternity.
The act of sex has nb significance at all
unless it is translated by the mind into an
image of fusion with beauty. I do not mean
that the act itself can be idealised into an
ethereal realisation of beauty, but that it
can become etherealised as a symbol of form
in art, as the culminating release in emotion
where the packed and conflicting material
in a work of art is unified by a centrifugal
energy. In all Harris’s labored mass of fact
there is not one statement where the actual
embrace is lighted with a phrase that sug-
gests the spirit’s movement, where the actual
touch branches into those dazzled eternities
of laughter where all lovers, from Sappho
and Anactoria to Siegfried and Brunhilde,
linger. And to descend from these regions
of poetry where (whether it be Shakspeare’s
lovely girls or Herrick’s slight, tweaking
caresses) the essence is the same, and to
come to a writer closer to the form in which
Harris writes, Casanova —what a variation
do we see!
It may surprise my small but select public
of satyrs apd nymphoinanes to hear that I
do not believe Casanova to be the greatest
writer known because he retails more love-
episodes than anyone else: he is based in
realism and even lacks the final point of self-
exposure which sanctifies Pepys. But he is
as honest as he can be, and, what is more
important, narrates his affairs with a rare
charm and tact. He does not base them
merely on the physical finality, as Harris
does, which, from the realistic point of view,
is the same whether Helen of Troy or Doll
Tearsheet be the prize. He bases them, in-
stead, on the action of seduction, the gallan-
tries of wooing, llie railleries of an accom-
plished laughter, and by this means he gives
a very fair definition of the varying charac-
ters of the girls. He has a real and very
valuable skill in this most difficult task. All
his girls are differentiated, and occasionally
he gives us so true and charming a sense of
the identity of one of them that his book
assumes the properties of a work of art.
Casanova’s virtue lies in this: that he
builds on the unique and diverse per-
sonality of each desired girl, not on an act
universally similar. He gives the act in
terms of the girl, not the girl in terms of
the act. Harris builds purely on text-book
details, and so shares the barren futility
of a medical volume on the subject or of the
walls where small boys scribble the rudest
things they can think of —a simple enough
pleasure, and one of which I would not
dream of attempting to deprive them. But
I would hardly go the extremes of calling
them imtsters in the art of sex-frankness;
and if I would not invoke the policeman. I
would as certainly not demand the Nobel
prize for them.
And in this we have, I think, the crux of
the matter. Harris is an old man now;
and there is more than one proverb to tho
effect that infantile and senile minds think
alike, for their bodies are equally weak.
This strangely fatuous book can have no
other reason. The way Harris boasts of
mysterious and incredible feats of sexual
prowess, the very unrealistic staying powers
with which lie blandly credits himself with-
out the wink of an eyelid, can have only
one explanation. He records endlessly the
unfaltering reverence for his physioue which
the ladies paid, their voices broken with
ecstasy.
“0 you great, strong dear!” she cried, with her
arms clasping me. “O who would have believed...
O how I love you, you wonder and delight! Ij
am all yours,” she added gravely..., “I am your
mistress, your slave, your plaything, and vou arej
my god and my love! Oh, darling, oh!” ■
There is a lot of maundering like this, in
the intervals of which Harris gives the en-
raptured .ladies little lyecturettes on sex-
hygiene. One is afraid that the “Contem-
porary Portraits,” with their muddle of
truth, invention and the hodge-podge of a
generation’s gossip commandeered as experi-
ences of his own, have muddled his mind
itself. Anyhow, he is an old man, perhaps
an astute old man who saw the chance to
swim in on the “Ulysses’'-boom to a finan-
cially satisfactory notoriety, but certainly
ap old man recalling amid chuckles the feats
of a youth that has receded rosily into the
fictional romance of memory, never to be
regained.
JACK LINDSAY.
Art and Art Criticism
Recent Red Page comments upon the art
of Max Meldrum, interesting, illuminating
even, as indicating the influence of a pose,
open up a wide field for healthy discussion
as to what art really is. The outstanding
feature of Meldrum’s landscape art. is its
utter unreality, its easiness, its lack of ideal-
ism. It does not even express what its
author claims for it. It is not realism, not
creative. What, then, is it? The Meldrum
influence on landscape art in Australia is
decadent. He sets up a false standard for
students to emulate. His pictures are quite
lacking in artistic qualities, in poetry,
romance. This dominating influence obsesses
his disciples; they all paint alike in the
Meldrum manner. They spread their palette
with Meldrum mud, and deliberately ignore
the harmonies of Nature. Their work is
wholly derivative, never individual. Their
artistic vision becomes atrophied, until they
are unable to recognise a good subject when
they see it.
Meldrum’s methods may pass when
applied to portraiture, but landscape paint-
ing is quite a different proposition. To
endeavor to express the moods of Nature with
the same palette that you would use for
portraiture can only end in disaster.
Schools of Art are the pitfalls besetting
the way of the student —dangerous, soul-
destroying. Many definitions of art perplex
the student; but, alas, there is no royal road
to success. Definitions will not help much.
Hard work is the only possible solvent.
Definitions are never satisfactory.
What is art? What is that quality in a
picture which proclaims it to be art, and
in what way does it differ from a painting
that lacks art? Art is emotion, self-revela-
tion. Perhaps the best definition is “Nature
seen through temperament.” Temperament
is that elusive quality in art out of which
genius evolves: and genius is Divine Fire
nourished on infinite capacity for taking
pains. Temperament is inseparable from
art, is responsible for the many delightful
qualities which make one artist’s work dis-
tinct from another’s. In this way indivi-
duality, mannerism, is the expression of
temperament. But art is more than the
expression of individual temperament. It
is the expression of life saturated with
human experience, incarnate with spirit
of its age. In short, it is emotion. Without
emotion it is not art; and Meldrum’s work
entirely lacks emotion. Emotion is the breath
of life existing in art; it is the soul of art.
The artistic vision aided by the skill of the
craftsman dissolves the roughage of Nature,
and out of the crude materials creates a
thing of beauty.
So we find that art is emotion plus beauty;
that is to say, the creative vision of the
artist idealises the crude realisms of life.
Art must, therefore, possess the following
primary qualities: (1) A central idea,
(2) technique, (3) human interest, (4)
emotion, (5) rhythm, (6) composition.
(7) sincerity. If these attributes exist
in combination in a work, we have art
—a thing of beauty, a joy for ever; lacking
them the work is merely paint. Yet there
is no steady evolution of art towards per-
fection. All these qualities may exist in
the art of earlier ages in a relative degree.
The artist of the Stone Age had as much
sincerity, as much romance in proportion
to his intellectual development, as the artist
of the present or any other age. It is till
a matter of relativity. The art of one age
may be inferior in some respects to the art
of the preceding age, but the highest stand-
ard of art in every age must be accepted as
the intellectual culture of that age, and as
such be free of criticism. You cannot com
demn the highest art of any age as bad art.
You can only say it is the expression of the
intellectual life of its age.
Australian art should strike a new, dis-
tinctive note. Heedless of schools and cults,
it should strike as distinctive a note as the
Greek and Renaissance artists struck. It
should be spontaneous, wholesome, sun-
kissed ; not morbid, not \icious, not prurient.
Any groping backward to express the spirit
of a former age is invariably degenerate,
imitative. We cannot excel artists of an-
other age in rendering life and thought and
morals of their own period. We must leave
them their laurels.
Modern art, particularly Australian art.
should' not concern itself with morals and
ideals of the art of other times and places.
The artist’s aim should be to make the in-
ward spirit of things shine through the out-
ward form, as the sunrise shines through
•he mist of dawn —suggestively. 'Artists
differ from photographers in that they paint
moods and emotions of Nature; are not so
much concerned with the mere material
form. Sir Joshua Reynolds held' that a
student should study hard from the model'
and then shut himself in the studio without
model, without studies, and paint irom
memory. The result should be intellectually
ideal. Thus cultivation of the memory in
art cannot be too earnestly stressed; in out-
door sketching, for instance, it is not so
much a matter of how much you accomplish
as of how much you memorise.
The truth is there is good work, meri-
torius effort, in all honest endeavor. Critics
frequently slate an artist for not doing some-
thing or* other which he deliberately re-
frains from doing. The question is, “What
(is the artist’s point of view, what is he try-
ing to express?” You cannot demand trans-
cendental excellence of draftsmanship with-
out. you lose proportionately in poetic
quality. You cannot have it both ways. The
critic should jettison any pre-conceivod
notions as to how a picture should bo
painted, and estimate the work for what the
artist intends it to represent; not criticise
realism in terms of romanticism, opera
bouffe in terms of grand opera, lyric in

and a noble row of Moreton-bays, both of which stand
condemned by the City Council without fair trial
because they are alleged to interfere with a scheme
of road-widening, although the Regional Plan Con-
vention people have shown a better way that will
preserve both the water and the trees. The front of
the iount oi education is fine: it breathes University

Making Goodyear Mean Good Wear
SUPERTWIST
Does That in Balloon Tyres
In perfecting the balloon tyre Good-
year aimed to carry on the fine
tradition that Goodyear Means Good
Wear.
In serving this aim Goodyear en-
countered some of the most difficult
tasks of its career.
The low-pressure, flexible-sidewall
characteristics of the balloon tyre set
up certain structural problems that
seemed to defy solution.
These problems were finally over-
come only by the development in
Goodyear’s own mills of a new kind
of cord material, the now celebrated
SUPERTWIST.
It can be said that SUPERTWIST
is unlike any material hitherto known
to tyre-making.
Its paramount advantage is its
superior elasticity.
It far outstretches the breaking-point
of standard cords.
The tyre body made of it absorbs
impact over a much larger area, and
thus is afforded greater protection
against stone bruises and like injuries.
And only Goodyear Balloons are
made with SUPERTWIST. It is
your assurance of greater service,
comfort and riding ease.
See the Goodyear Dealer in your
town to-day about Balloons for your

1 Every New Beale that goes into use helps to sell its successors. The more it is played
the greater proof does it give of the superlative quality of the Beale. It lasts far longer
than the 25-years written guarantee. It withstands the extremes of the variable Aus-
tralian climate that play such havoc with most instruments. It is good because it is
built"good.” It stays good because every item in it is the best.
2 In 30 years over 60,000 Beale Pianos have been sold. Here are sixty thousand reasons
reasons, not inducements why you should augment the list of satisfied owners.
3 In 1908, Beale Pianos gained every award at the Franco-British Exhibition. And they’re
even better to-day.
What do experts think of the Beale ? They praise it; they honour it by awards. But
they do more. They buy these instruments ! Consider this list:
4 The N.S.W. State Conservatorium —the" University of Music”— purchased 19 New
Beales. These were bought after close scrutiny and keen comparison by the highest
authorities in the land.
5 Thirty Beales ate in use at the Presbyterian Ladies’ Colleges at Pymble, Croydon and
Goulburn—bought on the cold, unemotional advice of experts.
6 The Studios of Farmer’s Broadcasting Station, 2 FC, have been equipped for the past
eighteen months with Beale Pianos, in horizontals, uprights and players.
7 Leading musicians of the State Lindley Evans, Andre Skalski, E. Bennett North,
Frank Hutchens, Henry Penn, G.Vern Barnett-perform on or own New Beales. And-
-8 Her Majesty Queen Mary purchased at Wembley Exhibition a Beale piano for
Buckingham Palace. In a letter to the London representative of Beale & Company,
the Queen’s Treasurer stated : "Her Majesty is much pleased with the tone of the in-
strument, and greatly admires the workmanship of the beautiful case.
What is it gives leadership to the New Beale ? Why has it sold itself to this long line of
critical buyers—unhampered by money considerations and unlimited in extent of choice ?
• It is the amazing "singing” tone of the New Beale the rich, liquid, satisfying tone.
Come in and play one of these instruments yourself in complete privacy.
"Let the New Beale sing to you.”

HTHE purchase of a pair of Silk
Stockings should be regarded
by the Australian Mother as a
matter of great importance, for
strange as it may seem, her choice
of hosiery has a direct bearing on
the future of her own children.
Not every Australian boy can become a
farmer, nor can it be expected that every
little Australian girl will one day find a
farmer husband. No, fortunes and happi-
ness of the present generation are in very
large part dependent on Australian com-
mercial development and it is the SZ)
manufacturing industries which create the
greatest demand for brains and offer the
highest rewards for energy and ability.
This brings us back to the purchase of Silk
Stockings by the Australian Mother. If
those she chooses are Made in Australia,
the money she pays for them is endowed
with powers akin to the magic of Alad-
din’s Lamp. It becomes part of that fund
of Australian-created, Australian-owned
wealth which finances. mammoth indus-
tries, builds factories, buys machinery,
reduces unemployment, converts unskilled
workers into highly paid artisans and, in
a hundred forms, provides opportunity for
Australia’s Youth.
The mighty undertakings of Geo. A. Bond
0 Co. Ltd the manufacture of Hosiery,
Half Hose, Underwear, Towels, Sheeting,
and the spinning of Cotton, giving employ-
ment to 1800 Australians and paying
£.300,000 annually in wages, all trace
back to the purchase of a single pair of
stockings by an Australian woman.
Therefore, madam, think of your children when
selecting silk hosiery and do not forget that in
buying the, Australian-made article you are
getting the limit of value at the price paid.

The Waiting Life.
Since it befell, ’twixt work and strife,
I had not time to live my life,
I turned my back on it until
Work should be done and strife be stilL
My hands and head for use are free,
Nor does my own life worry me,
But docile as a spaniel waits
Until this present stress abates.
Tranquil, unwatched, it’s there, I know,
With all its joy contained. But oh,
I hope, when I have time to play,
My life will not have run away!

Because the dream that, passing, kissed
The lips of one made known to fame
Touched mine, men call me plagiarist;
And I am broken with a name.
A golden thought goes echoing
A-down pny heart until it seems
My own. But now I dare not sing,
Remembered as a thief of dreams!

Poverty.
One dwelt alone by heights austere
In royal poverty,
With God and silence, seeking naught,
A spirit wholly free.
He knew the brotherhood of hills,
The sisterhood of trees,
The secret words of prayer and praise
In God’s green sanctuaries.
One dwelt with poverty accursed,"
Mean streets on every side,
Heart starved for love and loveliness
Her barren life denied.
She knew but sordid cares and toil
’ With every passing breath,
Until she met God’s messenger,
Whose splendid name wns Death!

Happiness.
Mine is the happiness of the pale lark
That wings far upwards, singing as he
goes,
Seeking the light, from coverts cool and dark.
To weave a song of love that no man
knows.
Mine is the joy of the gold-questing bee,
Lurking within the poppy’s silken cup—
Green things, wild things, warm hollows by
the sea;
The scents of lonely places crying up.
Mine is the happiness of sun and flower—
Of the frail-stemmed anemone that sways
To the wind’s tenderest touch, and hour by
hour
Gives of its best unto the sweet, blue days.
Mine is the strong, fierce gladness of a tree
That, cliff-bound, strains above the whiten-
ing surge,
Lending the storm a loud-voiced ecstasy
In answer to the sea’s imperious urge.
The happiness that’s bought with piled-up
pence;
The rapture of success that’s hardly got;
The careful love that’s bounded by a fence —
That happiness, dear God, I know it not!
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
The Isle of the Green Valley.
In tlie Isle of the Green Valley,
Where the faded winds are furled.
The waves that are weary rally
From all the seas of the world;
They lie on the sands sleeping,
Too languid for sob or prayer,
With the sun and the stars keeping
Watch in the silent air.
Rain with a soft falling
Comes in the quiet night;
And the skies are for ever calling
The trees to the high light.
Full are they all of singing,
But their roots are in soft gloom,
Where the deep mosses are springing
And the deep heart has room.
Down in the gentle places,
Filled with the green calm,
The people with lifted faces
Under the roof of palm
Are singing and still singing—
For so they must sing or die —
Of a white bird winging
And the stars in a far sky.
They sing of the raging ocean,
Of the wind that tears the night,
Of the frantic haste and commotion
Of clouds in wild flight,
Of the noise of the rolling thunder
And the lash of the driving hail
And the passion of fierce wonder
Set in the heart of the gale.
Where the tall men are walking
In a slow and stately ease
And the fair women are talking
Under the silent trees,
For this are their calm hearts feeling.
This and no other thing:
A tempest of hot blood reeling
Through a lust of imagining.
In the Isle of the Green Valley,
Where the soft winds sleep,
The words of the people rally
All dreadful tilings from the deep.
For this is the force untiring,
That sets men’s hearts aglow:
The end of the world’s desiring
Is the thing it may not know.

THE ELUSIVE "MIGRANT.”
Austbalia is is want of the right kind of
people to fill its empty spaces (a remark
which is past its first youth) and to occupy
its unbuilt factories, and it wants them
faster, with a view to contingencies, than
the local baby arrives. Therefore it runs a
Migration Department in London, with re-
sults which are considered unsatisfactory.
The institution recently made a special
“drive,” lasting six weeks, over the south-
west of England, and got the promise of 50
men, who mny or may not remain staunch,
but captured not even one superfluous female
or woman of no importance. Evidently the
lady of those parts is swift on her feet The
Department disclaimed all responsibility, de-
claring it had run its hardest. It said the
blame was due to “indifference to the attrac-
tiveness of Australia compared with the
United States and Canada, particularly the
former.” Yet the British Isles seem a good
archipelago to get away from. A Sydney
business man, back with news later than
that to be found in books of reference, drew
this picture the other day:—
When we read in Australia that so many million
British people are out of work we hardly realise
the extent of the stoppage. As you travel by rail
you pass through districts where not a single chimney
is smoking. In the shipyards only works here and
there carry on.
In this connection it is notable that the
fqmiliar item “Textile Industry’’ vanished
out of the index of the latest “Statesman’s
Year Book,” and the familiar chapter van-
ished out of the section devoted to Great
Britain. Possibly the textile business was too
saddening for detail. The lure of the dole
is said to be a reason why the workless
worker of Britain is slow to leave, but while
he is slow to leave for Australia, which pays
men to bring him in, his desire to get to
the United States, which pays very uncere-
monious men to keep all but a bare quota
out, amounts to a passion.
* * * »
The causes of this desire to go where he is
not wanted, and not to go where he is
wanted, must be strong, or numerous, or
both. It can’t be because of the vast areas
Uncle Saji has to give away. In 1921
(latest figures) the United States had barely
190,000,000 acres of public land left and
available for settlers. Of this 53,000,000
acres were in Nevada, an alkaline desert
region which is in process of abandonment
as the mines decay. The rest included Rocky
Mountains and similar protuberances. Half
the States, including the one, had no
unappropriated lands at all. Australia’s pub-
lic lands, in 1922, amounted to 1,735,000,000
acres, or nine times as much as the Republic
could show, and though desert is plentiful
there is more promising soil for the land-
hungerer than Uncle Sajiuel dreams of.
Uncle has no wonderful vacant spaces like
those in Queensland and the Northern Terri-
tory. But, as against that, he has.no wonderful
vacant cranks like those who, in both these
areas, persistently refuse to let the settler
buy a freehold, the one thing which is likely
to anchor him to the soil, and the only title
on which he can raise money in time of
stress. Further, the United States never
learned much of the art of job control, and it
has a rough way of deporting foreign Com-
munists who won’t keep reasonably still, and
imprisoning local ones. In addition it is short
in the matter of trades unionism, and Canada
is worse, while Argentina is lower dowm still.
Out of a recent list of 43 countries a few
prominent samples are placed as follows: —
Organised Workers per 1000 Inhabitants.
1 Austria .. ..171 I 21 United States.. 31
2 Germany .. 153 | 23 Canada .. 29
3 Great Britain .. 133 i 30 Argentina .. 14
4 Australia .. 120 \ 38 Brazil . . 3
9 Maoriland .. 73 |
The last six regions are the world’s princi-
pal outlets for emigration, and of these Aus-
tralia has the thinnest population, close up
to the greatest area, the most complete
trades-union system, and distinctly poor luck
in attracting settlers. Trades unions ought
to attract population. These are the awk-
ward facts which show that somehow now-
adays they don’t.
* # * *
Australia’s more successful English-
speaking contemporaries are badly off, too,
for Labor Governments and Labor members.
Maoriland has never had a Labor Govern-
ment. Among the 531 U.S. Federal legisla-
tors two Socialists and four individuals
ticketed “Farmer Labor” represent the entire
“advanced” element. Neither Canada nor
the U.S. does much in the way of old-age
and invalid pensions, and the baby bonus is
unknown. They are both addicted to Private
Enterprise, the U.S. in particular, and they
are somewhat militaristic when compared
with this country’s Labor ideals. They have
views about the comprehensive nature of
Federal rights and powers as against State
rights which many Australians would regard
as bloated tyranny. On top of all else they
lack, and especially the Republic does, that
rich influx of borrowed money for fraudulent
and unproductive swindles which is held by
an immense section of our people to be the
secret of Australia’s progress. Indeed, the
U.S. is fast paying off its public debt, and
Canada is doing something to the same
effect. And the fact sticks out that the British
worker in large numbers is ready and will-
ing and anxious to abandon his flag, his
Freetrade (for which it was understood that
he and Rajisay Macdonald were prepared
to perish together), his old-age pension, his
two doles (national and parochial), liis
trades unionism (to a great extent), his
job control, his share in the Empire, and
practically every chance of becoming a Labor
member like Jack Jones —all this provided
he can climb into the U.S. by hook or by
crook. It is a country which is far down
the list in the matter of imports in propor-
tion to population-—below Australia, Britain,
Canada, Maoriland, Argentina, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Holland, Norway, Sweden
and Switzerland —and it has no regrets on
the subject. It has no ambition to supply
the world with raw materials if it can sell
manufactured goods instead. It has a tariff
which makes Bruce’s latest effort look pale
and shadowy. It is advertised as a land
where the fiscal policy makes work plentiful,
and where the amount of work done and the
amount of wage earned are not levelled down
to a flat minimum, nor is the penalty for lack
of sufficient sloth a heavy fine, or even pos-
sible disqualification for work altogether.
Books are written about Yankee toilers who
climbed out of the ruck and became heart-
less millionaires, but the supply of that sort
of literature from Australia, if there ever
was a supply, left off long ago—it has been
replaced by the strike report, and by exhor-
tations from political and industrial bosses
to keep away from this land of woe. The
sort of crude advt. which fires the would-be
“migrant’s” imagination is to the effect that
Uncle Samuel’s Commonwealth owns 85 per
cent, of the passenger motor-cars in existence,
that the newest make can be bought for £6O
or £BO, that a little-used vehicle can often
be acquired for a tenner owing to the owner
selling off last half-year’s model and invest-
ing in last month’s instead, and that a
nigger of any standing is liable to be scorned
by liis associates, and perhaps even declared
white, if he remains a mere pedestrian.
Against these things Australia can’t even
advertise thfe christening of a new State, or
the opening of a new port, or the completion
of a transcontinental railway to prove that
it is alive.
THE ÜBIQUITOUS SLAVE-DRIVER
AND THE RECURRENT SLAVE.
Tiie announcement that the League of
Nations is handling a proposition put
forward by a British spokesman for
the eveutual abolition of slavery through-
out the world invites consideration of
how far that venerable institution has
been eliminated. An Australian was
recently startled out of his conviction
that all is for the best in this best of all
possible worlds by a Chinese cook in a Bri-
tish settlement in Borneo, who offered him
the fee-simple of a native girl of five for
the sum of 20 dollars. Slaves and slavery
had been simultaneously abolished in that
country by Rajah Brooke about 80 years
previously by the downright method of blow-
ing the slavers out of the water; but subse-
quent inquiry indicated that the traffic had
been revived, and is still in a flourishing
condition. The passion for personal free-
dom, which is said to be instinctive in the
Nordic race, is not strong in the Asiatic,
who in the excitement of a game of chance
will stake his leg on a throw of dice, and
then his arms, his trunk and finally his
whole body; after which he becomes the
debtor-slave of his successful opponent. The
European community of Hong Kong was
upset a few months ago because the British
Parliament asked inconvenient questions
about the persistence of domestic slavery
amongst the Chinese inhabitants of the
colony; in a country where a man condemned
to death by the slow slicing process can bny
a substitute at the price of a square meal
and a night’s debauch on hot rice-wine, the
supply of serfs is always likely to exceed the
demand, and the traffic will continue in spite
of official regulations. The Portuguese dele-
gate’s appeal to the League not to be too
precipitate in the matter of abolition was
largely due to the fact that the Portuguese
settlement of Macao, over against Ilong
Kong, is the local clearing-house for the
Chinese trade, while it flourishes to a dis-
tinguished degree all over the African pos-
sessions of the Dom. Even in India official
vigilance does not prevent an occasional
widow carrying her servitude in this world
over into the astral sphere by burning her-
self across her husband’s body amidst the
applause of all right-thinking people; and
under various aliases, such as indenture to
plantations and shop apprenticeship, it is
still largely the mainstay of industry' in
Assam, Cochin-China, China, Korea, South
America and other places.
* * * *
Commonly defined as being an arrange-
ment whereby one man becomes another
man’s property, the institution probably had
its origin in an act of mercy, stimulated
by cupidity, whereby a captive in war ex-
changed death for life in bondage; and the
family feeling which led to hereditary honors
extended the privilege to the children of the
slave. The longest-lived example of a whole
slave nation is Russia, which is inhabited by
a semi-Asiatic race. The progress of the in-
stitution in that country seems to indicate
that it responds to a deep-rooted instinct in
the racial soul. When the district around
Moscow first emerged into history, the people
were divided into slaves, free laborers with-
out fixed abodes and peasants. Peter the
Great, although a famous Westerniser, found
time to include the peasants amongst the
serfs, and by the eighteenth century the
three classes were all indistinguishably
blended. The habit of landowners bribing
away the slaves of other landowners, just
as rubber-planters in Malaya do to-day, led
to the human furniture of the fields being
proclaimed a permanent fixture, and land
was always sold together with the people on
it. The system rose to heights of great bru-
tality under Catherine 11., and owners
were allowed by law to knout or banish their
recalcitrant human cattle. A grave scandal
occurred in 1768, when a lady was found
to have executed 100 of her slaves in the
space of 11 years. The humanitarian Alex-
ander in 1861 emancipated 21 million persons
in order to bring his country into line with
the civilised world, which was just then sit-
ting back congratulating itself on having
abolished the institution elsewhere. Yet
the war of 1914 found Russia a nation of
slaves that were only nominally free, a fact
that was glaringly obvious to any visitor to
the country. Legislation had not succeeded
in breaking the influence of the communal
system, which was merely a form of slavery
to the clan or family instead of to an indi-
vidual. A nation of slaves does not wage
war for any length of time in a successful
manner, and the Russian effort crumpled up,
leaving 150-odd million serfs without a
master. It is possible to blame the Bol-
sheviks too much for re-imposing the tyranny
of a new dynasty of Czars over the be-
wildered horde; their great crime really con-
sists in harboring the delusion that a system
that was a necessity in Russia would also
be congenial to the rest of the world.
* * * *
Australia has not been specifically men-
tioned in the deliberations of the League,
but all true lovers of the elusive lady Liberty
should earnestly consider the prevalence or
otherwise of the institution in this country.
Attempts to introduce it may be easily cited
from almost any edition of the daily papers.
Making a man a fixture in his union is simi-
lar to making him indivisible from the land.
Refusing an energetic bricklayer the right
to lay bricks in his own back yard is making
him a slave to lazier fellow-unionists instead
of to a lord. The main features of the
communal system, in which each craft is
restricted to a family and output is reduced
to the level of the feeblest member, are
already well apparent in the structure of the
unions; and the last step in the process is
the handing over of the collective families
to the control of alien taskmasters like
Johanson and Walsh. In Australia, which
still has most of its pioneering to do, the
imposition of the family system is an obvious
anomaly. Burke and Wills did not take
their domestic establishments with them into
the desert, nor did Ross and Keith Smith
fly en famUlc across the globe.
COMMUNISM AND THE HOME.
Tub finest of all human arts is that of home-
making. All- other arts are subservient to
it; and every art, in the final examination,
must be judged by the relation it bears to it.
Every feeling of patriotism lias home roots;
and the world’s greatest achievements have
always been made possible by a background
of home. That tribe was the most firmly
established which felt the home idea through
all its families; and that nation was the
strongest which carried the notion on to in-
clude the whole of a people politically asso-
ciated or occupying a definite tract or coun-
try. Such communities of men united m
great toils and splendid sacrifices, yet down
at the bedrock of all was the sense of indi-
vidual possession in the home. The possessions
on which a home rests may not be material
possessions at all; but they are none the
less real because they consist of memories,
associations and dreams.
* * * *
The modern tendency is to belittle the
home. Great masses of people m all civil-
ised lands are continually on the move, the
rich thronging the great hotels, the poorer
living in hired rooms and boarding where
they may. Travel —legitimate as a means
of education or recreation —becomes a habit
with many; wandering from city to city
and job to job a practice of their
poorer neighbors. But these are only ex-
treme manifestations of the anti-home reel-
ing that is prevalent among those who have
all the means of home-making. In too many
cases the house is only a shelter, and all
possible time is spent away from it bj
young and old. The streets, the picture-
shows, the racecourse and the week-end re-
sort fill up all the week that is not actually
absorbed by work and the necessities ol
existence. The house is without comfort and
without charm, though the garden and one or
two rooms may be used for showy display.
The people sleeping under the roof live
almost as strangers. There are no tender
associations, no sacred memories, no posses-
sions dear on account of their story; aad—
because this is a necessary corollary ot the
lives the inmates live —there is no taste
and no sign of any sense of the beautiful.
That such houses in Australia are counter-
balanced by many true homes goes without
saying; but the proportional number
appears to be decreasing; and with
the decrease all the unrest, social and
industrial, becomes more and more. marked.
Though the decay of the home is essen-
tially an individualistic movement dic-
tated by self-seeking and lack of social
feeling, it is this that more than
anything else gives room and for
the preaching of the doctrine ot Com-
munism. Communism, as outlined bv
some enthusiastic dreamers, is intensely
social, but its direct appeal in Australia is
entirely anti-social. It is not the aspect ot
common work for a common end that is
stressed, but the possibility of getting more
for the individual through an equality of dis-
tribution. The mainspring of a demand for
such equality is envy of others, ami
envy is in all circumstances anti-social. Ibe
Communist claims that the world's failures
are accidental, and it is always possible to
point to special liard-luck cases where the
man who might have had the good things
of life has missed them: but in the main it
may be taken as axiomatic that the failures
in the mass under one system must be the
failures under all. There may be countries
where life has been lived ou such a low
plane by the majority of the people that any
political change is felt to be for the better,
but as a general rule the man who has once
tried his hand at the great art of home-
making is never stampeded into a belief that
Communism forced upon the people from
without can take the place of the social indi-
vidualism on which all human advance has
been based. The home. and Communism are
two violently opposed ideas, and everything
that works against the home plays directly
into the hands of the Communists.
* * * *
In Australia the anti-home idea has been
largely intensified by the wide extent of the
continent and its boundless possibilities. Ihe
settler’s position in his bush homestead lias
not in most cases differed greatly from that
of the gold-miner in his tent. It has been so
easy to pull up the stakes, to sell the pad-
docks and stock, and to seek a new dwelling
in some district that seems to offer larger
opportunities. Though the home is not really
dependent on place, place has filled a large
part in the growth of the home idea, lhe
great sentiment that clings to the trees a
great-grandfather planted, to the roads
trodden by men in whom ran the same blood,
to the old walls, to the old household
treasures, to the old views from the win-
dows and to the old graves in some tree-
shadowed corner grips at the hearts of men
and creates something like a home religion.
Not very much of that religion has yet had
a chance to grow up in the Commonwealth.
The people arc still somewhat nomadic in
their habits and thought. A land-agent in
almost any district would tell you that any
property in the district could be purchased
at a price; and though the purchasing of
property does not mean the purchasing of
the home, the condition of affairs makes the
home a little more uncertain in its founda-
tions than it might otherwise be. The growth
of the cities, too, has an unsettling effect
Although some of the world’s most beautiful
homes have belonged to cities, the atmosphere
of the open places has always been more
conducive to their permanence. Yet per-
manency is not an essential quality of the
home to-day any more than it was when
the home was a moving - tent. He
is no real home-maker who accepts
an ancestor’s house as a museum of
the past over which he is guardian. The
changes must be many as the minds that
make the home, for home-making is a busi
ness of the living, not of the dead. But
the swagman life, which many desire to live,
is the one fatal thing. To be of the herd
and move with the herd, to lose all the
subtler joys of life for the supposed inde-
pendence which money will buy in public
places, to have alleged possessions and in
no real sense possess any of. them —these
are destructive of the whole idea that under-
lies home and patriotism. And they are among
the things that give Communism its opening
and excuse. What is needed is a return to
careful thought about the problems of the
hour by citizens who desire the general
good Those who say that the public
must unite against the advance of Com-
munism must : go a little farther and realise
the point at which the stand must be made.
That point is the home.


POWER ALCOHOL.
Last year about 70,000,(MM) gallons of liquid
fuel for use in motor aud other internal-
combustion engines was imported into Aus-
tralia from overseas, and next year we shall
probably take quite 100,000,000 gallons. By
far the greater part of present importations
comes from countries outside the British
Empire, although British, or partly-British,
companies control much of the production.
Consumption is increasing faster than
supply; the United States, which used to
be the largest exporter of petrol, through
lessened production and increased consump-
tion has now to obtain supplies from out-
side her own boundaries. It is very likely that
prices for liquid fuel will rise, and there is
the danger that imports to Australia might
be cut off altogether if, as is possible, an-
other great war broke out.
Happily, although Australia is, so far as
is known, delicient in natural-oil fuels, she
has the advantage over many other countries
in possessing the necessary elements for the
production of raw materials which can be
used for the manufacture of alcohol. The
sources from which alcohol can be obtained
are almost innumerable; it can be produced
from any substance, whether vegetable or
other, which contains fermentable sugar or
some component which can be converted into
fermentable sugar. As to what material
shall be used, the question is wholly one of
cost. Molasses and cassava stand out from
all others as likely to give good results. The
former yields 65 gallons of alcohol (95 per
cent.) per ton, and cassava 40 gallons per
ton. A. V. Board, of the International Sugar
and Alcohol- Co., who recently visited
Queensland, favors cassava, and his
opinion is strongly supported by the
Commonwealth Institute of Science and
Industry: but the Northern Power Alcohol
Committee, which consists of men promi-
nent as sugar-millers and -growers in the
Cairns-Innisfail area, advocates the use of
the waste products of the mills. This year
Australian consumption of sugar will absorb
only 60 per cent, of the Commonwealth pro-
duction, leaving 40 per cent, to be either
exported at a heavy loss or used for power-
alcohol manufacture. Molasses form a cheap
source of supply for power-alcohol, but the
total yield from the 1925-26 crop is estimated
as only sufficient to produce 7.200.000 gallons
of 95 per cent, alcohol, or about one-seven-
teenth of the supply needed for the Com-
monwealth. The Northern Power Alcohol
Committee has, however, devised a scheme by
which the lower-grade syrups resulting from
the crushing of the whole crop of cane might
be eliminated and used for enriching the
molasses. The marketable sugar would then
be mill-whites, which it would be unneces-
sary to send to the refinery, thus lowering
the cost of sugar to the public, and increas-
ing the quantity of material for the manu-
facture of alcohol.
There is a considerable difference between
the Institute of Science and Industry's
figures as to cost of production and those
of the Northern Power Alcohol Committee.
The Institute takes it for granted that the
distillery will be independent of and apart
from the mill; but the Committee believes
in a permanent distillery erected within a
sugar-mill, which would promptly deliver the
raw material ready for the fermenting-vats
with practically the same labor and super-
vision and fuel, and with only slightly
increase overhead charges, such as inter-
est, depreciation and maintenance. The
Committee puts down the cost of
manufacture of alcohol from the en-
riched molasses at less than sd. per
gallon, while the Institute estimates the cost
at from 6d. to 9d. per gallon. The Insti-
tute’s estimate for handling and distribution
is 16d. per gallon, while that of the Com-
mittee is only 9d. Alcohol as a suitable fuel
for internal combustion-engines must be
mixed with about a third of its bulk of
benzol or ether. Enough benzol cannot be
obtained locally, and to import it would be
too expensive: but the Committee believes
that the etherisation of alcohol (produced
from the alcohol distilled at the mills) will
provide suitable methods for turning out
marketable motor-spirit.
To sum up, the Institute calculates the
total charges for manufacture (exclusive of
the cost of raw material), denaturing, excise
supervision and distribution at from Is. 6d.
to Is. 9d. per gallon, while the Committee
places the total cost at Is. The calorific
power of petrol is greater than that of
alcohol in the proportion of 133,000 B.T.U.’s
per gallon to 91,000, but it is insisted that
this disadvantage disappears by higher com-
pression in motor engines. Power alcohol
will certainly have to be sold at a concession
on the price obtained for petrol. The extent
of the concession is, however, a matter of
argument. The opinion of the Northern
molasses-men is that 3d. should cover it; on
the other hand the chief chemist of the
Vacuum Oil Co. has declared on oath that
if petrol sells at 2s. power alcohol will not
compete unless it sells at Is. 3d. Nor is
the conflict only between the people inter-
ested in the two oils. The Institute states
that the amount available for the purchase
of raw material will be from 6d. to 9d. per
gallon; on the other hand the Committee’s
estimate is that the amount of Is. to Is. 3d.
per gallon of alcohol would be available for
the purchase of cane. The Institute says
that the price which the distiller of alcohol
from molasses could afford to pay for cane
would be from 10s. to 15s. per ton; the
Committee is certain that on a 60-40 basis
£2 per ton can be paid to farmers for cane.
To end the ceaseless argument over figures,
a power-alcohol distillery is now in course
of erection at Sarina, near Mackay, to work
in co-operation with the Plane Creek mill,
and the Government has arranged to make
an advance of £25.000 by way of loan for
the undertaking. In addition to molasses.
300 acres of cassava will be planted, and
the crop used for distillation, the Federal
Government having granted a bonus of 4d.
per gallon on alcohol derived from this
source.
The main factors which, in my opinion,
contribute to making alcohol a more desir-
able and possibly a cheaper motor fuel than
petrol are: (a) Smoother running, (h)
absence of carbonisation, (c) absence of un-
pleasant exhaust, (d) greater safety from
fire owing to miscibility with water, which
results in lower insurance costs and safe
bulk handling. If expenses of manufacture
can be reduced and costs of distribution
cut down (for instance, by putting up the
spirit in drums instead! of in tins and cast's) so
that the fuel can be sold at a slightly less
cost than petrol, it is not unlikely that the
marketing of the material might be under-
taken by one of the big companies now hand-
ling petrol. At any rate, the proposition to
supply Australia from within with all the
liquid fuel required is worthy of all the
effort we can put into it. The sum of £501)0
granted by the Federal Parliament for the
payment of a bonus of 4d. per gallon on all
power alcohol produced from materials other
than sugar-cane or molasses is quite in-
adequate. To help what ought to be and
may be a big national industry the bonus
should be paid for every gallon of power
alcohol produced within the Commonwealth,
including what is manufactured from
molasses. Even £lOO.OOO would not be too
high a price to pay for immunity from
danger from a cessation of imports of petrol
from overseas and for the establishment of
an industry which would give employment
to many white Australians.
W. PRESTON DAY.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
One Hughes and Another.
Ex-Prime Minister Hughes, sulking in his
tout and occasionally putting out his head
to snarl, isn't a cordial and disinterested
helper in this time of emergency. While
the affable Bruce floundered along with his
plans for the deportation of imported revolu-
tionists and his amateurish Deportation
Court was making heavy weather, the
silence of Hughes was much commented on.
Being at last beguiled into speech he deli-
vered himself thus:—
The whole world is riven by a class struggle, and
to deport any man because of his opinions is to
preclude all possibility of a reconciliation between
the two sections of society who jointly make the
nation, and on whose harmonious relations the future
of society depends.
Then the unhelpful man made some remarks
about how much better work he did than
Bruce in the way of making the Red
element sit up and take notice, and how, in
his day, that objectionable species was
■‘never able to obtain control,” finishing as
follows:
Having said so much, and agreeing entirely with
all that Mr. Bruce says about the danger to society
from Bolshevists and Communists, it only remains to
add that 1 am not in favor of deporting one of the
parties to the present dispute.
The sum total seems to be that Hughes is
prepared to disapprove of anything done by
liis successor (an unambitious man who
didn’t want to succeed, but had the succes-
sion thrust on him), but any hint of what
ought to be done will apparently be reserved
until his own return to office. Still it is
instructive to look back upon vvliat the same
Hughes did in a smaller emergency when
he was Prime Minister eight years ago. V. G.
Childe, one-time private secretary to the
late John Storey, Labor Premier, writes in
his book “How Labor Governs”:—
Hughes, still Prime Minister, though no longer a
Labor man, introduced special legislation to suppress
the I.W.W. The Unlawful Associations Act, as this
astounding measure was called, made it an offence
punishable by six months’ imprisonment to belong
to the I.W.W. or other associations to which its
provisions mi<jht be extended, if the offender was
an alien by birth he might be deported after the
expiration of his sentence.
Hughes probably hoped that the mere threat of
such penalties would cause the organisation to melt
away. It speaks highly for the courage and idealism
of the members that, despite the illegality, the
I.W.W. cbntinued to exist and carry on its public
work. A number of prominent members were occa-
sionally gaoled, but it was not until the time of
the big strike in 1917 that a thorough round-up
of the members took place.... But then the Federal
authorities... .arrested several scores of members,
and had them sentenced to the maximum terms of
imprisonment under the Act. Tom Barker and
other leading lights, after completing their sentences,
were deported, and the organisation was finally
crippled.
Hughes in office had a short and sudden
way with insurrectionists and destroyers of
civilisation who happened to be born outside
Australia, and if the party paid him the
compliment of asking him to resume the
leadership he would probably be quite as
sudden, unless age has told on him. As a
political economist he was pdor, and as a
statesman of the patient, constructive and
pioneering sort he was terrible. With a
rich province to develop. Governments with
which he was connected (he was part of
eight Federal Cabinets and head of four)
showed a capacity for passive neglect which
amounted to a marvel. But Hughes in a
really bad temper could be a man of action
when at his best, and perhaps can be yet.
He had few illusions about the advantages of
gentle forbearance in the case of irreconcilable
and combustible animals, and warnings to
the effect that strenuous doings would pre-
cipitate revolution only seemed to make his
temper worse, It was never very good.
. .
Can’t Sonibeody Put Up a Fight?
Some of these Nationalists of ours make this
paper tired. • They are top like the polite
last kings of played-out dynasties— Edward
the Confessor, or the tail-end of the Valois
family, or Boabdil, the final Moor of
Granada. N. S. Wales ex-Premier Fuller
has resigned his leadership at the age of
64. It isn’t so old; yet lie was too tired
Avhile he held office to create an elective
Upper House on the Senate or one-consti-
tuency plan ; he was too tired even to fill
vacancies in the old House. Probably it
would have been too much to ask him to
introduce the referendum, which is the last
thing that the Red element has any use or
desire for; but he might easily have hung on
to his job till the close of the financial year,
and not given his opponents a second oppor-
tunity to manufacture a deficit for his party.
And when ex-Speaker Levy announced the dis-
covery that the Casual Vacancies Act had
really expired, and the appointment of a
Laborite in place of Birt, deceased, was
quite illegal, a leader with the fighting in-
stincts of the peccary would have rushed the
High Court for an injunction, and for all
other available apparatus. (P.S. —The
peccary is a small pig which lives in South
America and attacks express trains for fun.)
The Lang Government, with its incurable
tendency to bo uncivil, and with its “spoils”
policy, proceeded to worry Agent-General
Gocks out of office. If he had held on he
might have forced the Ministry to make a
more definite exposition than it liked of its
method of providing billets for its friends,
and also to go into some detail with its
vague charge that something was amiss with
Cocks’s accounts when he was Treasurer.
There was no chance for the dispossessed
official to re-enter Parliament at a by-
election on his return and argue his case
there, so his meek surrender was overdone.
A less tired man would have offered to
be as combative as the Premier, or more so,
if necessary. He might have added that he
would hang on to the last moment and later,
and that if he couldn’t collect his salary
otherwise he would put the bailiff in on his
own office furniture. And if forced out
he at least might have declared the job black.
Then perhaps Timothy Cogjilan, who is
rich and (18, and has been holding offices of
one sort and another pretty continuously
for 41 years, might have been ashamed to
fill the gap. It would have looked like
blacklegging. The passive futility of
Mitchell, of Westralia. also deserves a
monument. It was a mere looking for
trouble to leave a collection of decayed gold-
fields with 10.684 votes among them to re-
turn 11 members while a prosperous residen-
tial district, possessing 11.508 votes, had only
one. There is a sameness about decayed
goldfields. ,So Mitchell was left (which
didn’t matter), and “Labor” arrived (which
did matter). As for Prime Minister Bulge
he reminds one more of Boabdil cl Chico
than any of his contemporaries. Boabdil
was a perfect gentleman, but he lacked velo-
city in getting off the mark. Certainly Bruce
declares war against Communism pretty
regularly, but he seems to make leeway all
the time. News about the enlistment of
the proposed Federal police force is non-
existent, and if the standing army has got
beyond the old figure of 1708 that news is
non-existent likewise. But the proposal of the
revolution leaders to concentrate all the Bri-
tish seamen and firemen on strike in a camp
close to Melbourne, and almost outside the
Prime Minister’s office, is real and definite
enough. It is cheerless business to be a
worker who isn’t allowed to work, follower
to a leader who doesn't lead, or barracker
for a rooster that won’t fight. The anti-
Communist gets a great deal of all three
experiences.

When Australia Stood on the Verge.
Some 25 or 30 years ago luck might have
taken a turn other than the one it took
(have turned to the left instead of to the
right, so to speak! , and t <e resulting chain
of events might ha ;e madt war with Japan
in 1914 inevitable. It was when Japan had
settled its long aect ant wit ». China over the
possession of Kore; , after coming so close
to disaster as to ma. :e it res? five to be better
prepared in future. It ha< enriched itself
with valuable territ iries, s nd was eating
its rice with content! lent, w. en the irresist-
ible combination of Russia. France and
Germany served it wi h noth eto quit. The
position of Russia wa. understandable. It
had been seeking an \ ee-1 ;ee port during
three centuries, and if J. pa i dug itself into
its new position the Mi sco ite might seek
for three centuries mor : am, find nothing.
The position of France i vas oi vious enough,
for Russia was the frien l on whom
the republic relied i ’lien there was
new trouble on the Rhin i. . (gainst these
twm, then, no serious ang >r was en-
tertained. But the ca isel* ss meddling
of the Hun, who had b<\ “ mistaken for
almost a bosom friend, roused Nippon to
fury. So the islanders retired, and started
to fish for an ally with whom they could
make a good insurance treaty—each Power
to stand by the other if engaged by more
than one big enemy at a time. Britain was
the only such friend available, and the matter
was fixed in view of a flabbergasted world.
If the Hun had kept out, and the ejectment
notice had come from Russia and France
only, there would have been two possible
allies, Germany and Britain, to whom the
folk at Tokio could have made advances.
And of the pair Germany, with its ability
to exercise prompt and overwhelming pres-
sure on the Bear’s tail and other vital parts
in Poland, would have had the preference,
as a matter of course. In that case, what
would have happened in 1914? Speculations
of various sorts have been indulged in. One
is that Britain would have left a sufficient
force in the Pacific and Indian oceans to
look after the extra enemy; but as the extra
enemy owned seven Dreadnoughts, 16 pre-
Dreadnoughts, 67 destroyers and submarines,
30 cruisers and sundries, the probable result
of detaching enough ships would have been
the loss of a decisive battle and of the Empire
in European waters. Another course would
have been to leave the Nipponese to do, with-
out resistance, whatsoever they considered
most damaging to the Allied interests and
most profitable to themselves on the Aus-
tralian and Maoriland coasts, stopping trade
and the export of the troops which were so
essential; and, finally, having wiped out local
shipping, the enemy might have passed into
other oceans and done more service. A third
alternative is that Britain, finding allies too
few and enemies too many, might have kept
out of the war altogether; but that is the
most unthinkable of all, for it would have
meant a German-ruled continent, and the big
Hun guns commanding London and the
Thames. No, the abandonment of Australia
and Maoriland to their fate would have been
the obvious course to follow. And that such a
disaster didn’t happen was only due to what
millions of people 10 years earlier had re-
garded as a tragic blunder. But it is not
the sort of tragic blunder that we can de-
pend upon being repeated—for one reason,
because prize fools of Potsdam don’t grow in
every generation, and if there had been no
prize fool in this case, no “tragic blunder”
could have saved the situation. Exactly
similar circumstances probably never will
occur again. But the experience ought to be
a strong hint that no country is so far away
from the universe that it is not liable to
assault by a possible enemy at some time or
other. The number of lines that may drag
it into trouble is amazing.
Bribery and Corruption.
Tiik world over commercial morality is de-
clining from its old standards, •‘draft;’ in
U.S.A. lias become a byword. It not only
permeates commerce and industry, but has
spread its cancer-tentacles through the
administrative life of the community. The
dollar speaks from bottom to top of the
whole civic system. And not in the U.S.A.
alone. In an address delivered by It. M.
Leonard to the Amsterdam Itotar.v Club in
June the speaker said: "Bribery is exceed-
ingly common in (treat Britain. One of our
Judges indeed has declared that our business
life is honeycombed with it. I know of
scarcely any profession or trade which bears
no traces of the tar-brush.” Yet the British
statute-book contains one of the most com-
plete pieces of legislation the world over to
meet this very evil. “Employers,” remarked
this speaker, “sometimes imagine that they
save money by paying low wages and wink
ing at the bribes their servants take; but, as
a matter of fact, they pay all the time—in
inflated prices, goods not up to sample, short
weight, short measure, and. worst of all, in
the loss of loyal service.” In Australia
some offset to such conditions leading to
corruption should be found in our laws con-
trolling wages. The compulsory payment
of a “fair wage” ought, one would think,
to lessen temptation in this direction. But
does it V Then' are people who, to quote
the eminent English Judge Sir Edward
Fry, "speak leniently, almost kindly, of
bribery... .some through a kind of stupid
good-nature, which thinks more of the grati-
fication of the recipient than of all the evils
resulting from the practice.” The late Lord
Russell (C..T.) once remarked: “Bribery
is a practice that tarnishes the character of
lawful commerce; it blunts the sense of
honesty in the man engaged in it; it is in-
jurious to the honest man trying to con-
duct his business on high and honorable
principles, and has a corrupting and de-
grading influence in ways that 1 need not
formulate or define.” Such ways are indeed
infinite: secret commissions, double invoices,
receipts to agents for more money than has
been actually paid, "palm oil,” “tips” and
the rest. Legislation may strive to reach
these practices, but can never, so subtle and
concealed is the offence, wholly or in any
great degree suppress them. The true remedy
is to be found in the civic conscience. “Bri-
bery,” said another English Judge, “has a
foothold alike in the private household and
in the big business office. It is difficult to
detect, for it is in the interest alike of the
giver and the receiver of the corrupt gift to
keep the thing secret.” Nothing will effectu-
ally check it except public opinion moved
by the consciousness that “graft” in its
manifold forms is so corrupting the avenues
of public, business and even private life as
to promise in the end a condition of affairs
rotten to the core in which no man dare
claim for himself the badge of honesty.
Striving after this Consciousness a body
calling itself the Bribery and Secret
Commissions Prevention League was formed
in England in 1906. It has now
grown to an influential force in the
community, and with its affiliations has
a total membership of 30,000 or more. Its
self-imposed duties are educational and puni-
tive, for in the performance of the latter
it brings before the tribunals of the country
cases which come within the reach of the
law. It has served as a model to other
countries where similar associations have
been formed; and it may be well worth the
attention of business men in the Common-
wealth who have a sincere desire to save
our commerce and our public administration
from falling into the condition which threat-
ens them.

Legal Research.
On a survey of two great fields of profes-
sional energy, law and medicine, the latter
including surgery, one cannot help being im-
pressed by one outstanding difference. In
medicine practically the whole advance comes
from within ; in law it comes from without.
One of the most important functions in
modern medicine is that of research —con-
tinuous application with a view to the ex-
pansion and improvement of the knowledge
and practice of the profession. Law, on the
other hand, awaits development at the hands
of the untrained law-givers. It has nothing
of itself —that is, of its own volition—to
offer for the betterment and development of
the body of the law. There is no distinctive
body of its members to whom the duty of
research, with a view to adding to, and
where desirable amending, existing law has
been delegated. There are, of course, writers
of text-books and so on who endeavor to
condense, classify and render easy of access
certain branches of law, but that is not
analogous to research. Even if we do not.
go beyond the limits where the law of the
English-speaking races runs —and all such
owns a common parentage—there is an im-
mense field to cover. In the U.S.A. alone,
with its many State legislatures independent
of Federal jurisdiction, there probably are
many statutes from which valuable informa-
tion could be drawn. A few at once suggest
themselves —factory laws; legislation with
regard to the welfare of children, their edu-
cation, their treatment for social offences,
and so on; industrial legislation, the regula-
tion of commerce; the various penal codes
with their penalties, the police laws and a
variety of other matters. In England the
Society for Comparative Legislation and a
few other associations do something in this
direction, but not as a recognised part of the
lawyer’s work. Thei’e ought to be a bureau
of information upon the world’s law. Special
research could then be undertaken in parti-
cular branches, the collated body furnishing
material upon which analytical work could
be done. Such a system once in going order
could extend its inquiries far and wide,
keeping itself alert as to the legalised
methods abroad of dealing with this, that
and the other subject matter with a view to
continuous reform in our own body of
enactments. We would have then a legal
objective before us which now is absent. It
would be not only to embody in our own
book of legislation such immediate measures
as presented themselves to Parliament, but
to offer to it, from within the profession,

“Troubled” : I live in the renowned sugar
district of Innisfail (Q.), and this is M'hat
has happened this season, all within the
space of about three months. To commence
with, there M-as an upheaval over the em-
ployment of foreigners at cane-cutting,
although these men are unionists and had
in most instances cut cane for years. After
the starting of certain mills had been delayed
for some time, a certain number of British
cutters were forced on the farmers, and the
mills started crushing. Matters proceeded
comparatively smoothly for a few weeks,
vffien the seamen’s strike for job-control
occurred. Two of the mills M 7 ere compelled
to stop crushing and pay off most of their
hands, having used up all available space
for storage of sugar. On some sort of an
arrangement being arrived at, the mills com-
menced to crush again. It was now the rail-
way employees’ turn to have a little rest,
and while that mock fight was on some of
the mills were again forced to cease opera-
tions, and again pay off their labor. During
this period the waterside workers and
seamen were at peace, but then the water-
side workers refused to travel to Mouril-
yan Harbor by motor-car or other road-
vehicle, because their usual mode of
conveyance was by Government tram-
way, and the tramway employees were
on strike. Of course, it would be scabbing
on their fellow-unionists, the railway em-
ployees, to travel by any other method than
the railway— it apparently isn’t scabbing on
the sugar-workers to stop them earning a
living. After 9 or 10 days, the Government
having surrendered, railway traffic was re-
sumed on the 7th inst., and all went merrily
—for about 24 hours. Then the waterside
workers decided that they should be engaged
for work under the rotary system. The re-
sult is that some of the ports are at present
again idle, Cairns and Innisfail being tM 7 o of
them, Townsville is still working, the men
there not being in favor of the system. The
Innisfail men have consequently declared the
Townsville men black, and will neither load
cargo for Townsville nor receive cargo
handled by the Townsville men. And this
is a supposed civilised country! What sort
of law or justice is it that alloMS men of
this type to hold up industry after industry,
until any demand of theirs, however unjusti-
fied, is conceded? And what is it going to
lead to?

“Horta”: According to Cann, N.S.W. Min-
ister for Health, Dr. Mclntyre Sinclair,
the Government’s commissioner in Geneva,
recently cabled that Spahlinger “was ex-
plicit and emphatic that no treatment would
be available for N.S.W. T.B. cases until
April. He Mould not see patients if they
came before then.” Whatever results Spaii-
linger may eventually obtain, most T.B.
sufferers have made up their minds that they
must look for immediate relief to other quar-
ters. Hence the following extract from the
British Medical Journal, commenting on
a vaccine prepared by Professor Calmette
(sub-director of the Pasteur Institute,
Paris), is of considerable interest:—
The results thus far obtained are most promising.
During- the past year 2000 new-born children were
vaccinated in France. Professor Calmette has been
able to trace 423 of those who have been vaccinated
for at least six months. None have died from tuber-
culosis infection. These facts are noteworthy in
view of the heavy toll T.B. ordinarily exacts from
the offspring of tuberculous parents.
There is one thing about Calmette’s treat-
ment which Mill appeal to many T.B.
patients who are sceptical about Spah-
linger’s methods. 'Whether his vaccine is
the right sort of dope or not, he has at
any rate enough of it to go round.
The tyranny of Public Service Boards is
notorious, but in no direction does it mani-
fest itself more emphatically than in con-
demning the already over-worked public ser-
vant to qualify for promotion by examina-
tion. The absurdity of such a test is obvi-
ous. A gathering of the intellectual cream
of the community is achieved at every gen-
eral election; yet M’hat member of Parlia-
ment has ever bepn called upon to pass an
examination? Nom 7 , however, it seems likely
that the service in N. S. Wales will be re-
lieved of its incubus: the Lang Government
is moving in the direction of calling on all
public servants to join their appropriate
unions. So M 7 i]l.be reached the happy posi-
tion already attained by the Red service of
Queensland. There the taxation office is
naturally increasing its staff: it M’ants eight
new assessors, tM r o assessors’ clerks and six
inspectors, and proposed to appoint them
after examination. Now, as examination is
a subtle form of competitive test in which
one man is sliom 7 h to be better qualified than
another, it is no good to Communism. The
Bananaland Public Service Unions saw this
at a glance, and promptly declared the exami-
nations “black.” and no candidate dare pre-
sent himself. So dies the tyrant!
“Rifleman'’ : I have noticed in my own class
(I’m a shop-assistant) a great shrinkage in
efficiency since the war. The slackening in
the last 10 years has been tremendous. It
can be traced from the top right down, and
is due, I think, to the large amount of easy
money-getting of late years. Also artificial
fixing of wage-rates and the growth of union
power has reduced the margin between the
various grades of shop-workers. Wages for
the men with responsibility have not advanced
at the same rate as those of salesmen. Where
formerly buyers, department managers and
floorwalkers could get 50 p.c. to 75 p.c. more
wages than counter-hands, to-day the mar-
gins are 5 p.c., 10 p.c. in some cases, per-
haps 25 p.c. oyer the minimum wage. I
know several big shops in Brisbane where
men promoted to be floorwalkers have asked
to be put back into their places behind the
counter. But perhaps the steadiness of em-
ployment has been the greatest cause of the
slackening; for fear of unemployment is the
greatest driving force towards efficiency in
any trade. That’s one side of the problem.
The bosses have deteriorated in many cases,
too —probably owing to the enormous amount
of easy money-making during and since the
war. I don’t imply a wish to get back to the
hellish conditions of a past generation. Effici-
ency should, be obtainable by less drastic
means. But it ought to be obtained somehow.
To-day when I size up my fellow shop-
workers, the percentage who show enthusiasm
or real interest only cm pay evening is shock-
ing. And it’s the youngsters who are the
most hopeless. What can we do about it?
Surely we are not going to be content to
be a nation of inefficients!
THE MOURNERS.
“Berkeley” : The Yic. Railways Classifica-
tion Board, which has had a full-time job
since 1919, seems to have lost most of its
business to the Federal Arbitration Court.
Chairman Judge Winneke is filling in time
at County Court work, and his colleagues,
after drawing substantial fees for over five
years, are back at their old railway jobs.
Whether the Board will have any real work
to do in future depends upon the results the
Australian Railways Union gets from the
Federal Court. The case at present before
the Court threatens a much higher wages
bill for Commissioner Clapp. The union has
claimed everything that it can think of at
the moment, and as the Court is chiefly con-
cerned with conciliation it must give some-
thing here and there if it is to retain the
business. The present enginemen’s award,
which covers less than 3000 of the 27,000
employees in the service, cost the Depart-
ment £75,000 a year. On the same basis an
award in the A.R.U. case is likely to put
costs up £500,000 a year. Although there is,
of course, always the surplus of £30,000, pro-
duced last year, to fall back upon, it is pro-
bable that Clapp’s many slogans will shortly
be changed into one frantic yell: “Help!”
“Loco” : No doubt “most railway accidents
are due to bad tracks,” as “C.E.F.” assures
us. At all events, if there were no bad places
in the road (I don’t like that imported word
“track”) uneven buffers would not matter
so much. It is the sudden drop into a hole
that is the danger when there is a low buffer.
I agree heartily with “C.E.F.” that good
roads are necessary for high speeds. But
in Australia, where perhaps one or two fast
trains run over the road in 24 hours, it would
be too expensive to keep the lines in the
same repair as in England, where trains run
every hour or less. Therefore we should be
satisfied with lower speeds until we get more
population. I have just come off a mere
45-p.li. country passenger run. It is fast
enough for me over a line where there is
one man employed as repairer to three miles
of permanent way. I don’t know how my
engine-springs stand it.
“The Listening Insect” : A stern effort is
being made to popularise Esperanto as the
language of the air. The Australian Wireless
Institute has approved, and pleas by Espe-
rantists are broadcast almost weekly. The
future of Esperanto as an international
auxiliary language, said one devotee in Syd-
ney, is assured. One doubts it; also one won-
ders what necessity there is for an auxiliary
international language when there is already
an international language that isn’t auxili-
ary. French is officially the language of inter-
national telegraphy, but it long since ceased
to be such except by courtesy. Berne, the
central bureau, daily bombards the world
with service messages in French, but the
practical business of communications is car-
ried on in English for the reason that about
three-quarters of the cables of the world
are in the hands of the Sassenach, a proud
and stubborn creature who refuses to learn
any language but his own. While the bulk
of the world’s shipping flies the British and
American flags, and the march of invention
and exploration in the ether remains largely
due to American and British enterprise,
English will continue to be the tongue of
the air. It is unfortunate that when after
hours of weary waiting an Australian en-
thusiast picks up an Argentinian they can-
not exchange their views on politics, art. or
women; but the matter will right itself in
time —the Argentinian wall learn English.
“Ex-R.N.”: Apropos Sydney ferry whistle-
blasts', what is dangerous is the use of these
sound signals in a fog—the regulations only
allow for their use between “vessels in
sight of one another.” Fog is most decep-
tive and may alter entirely the direction
of a sound. Hence the necessity for restrict-
ing the use of these signals.

One of the attractions of Canberra is to be
a Hall of Memory, in which are to be in-
scribed the names of all the Australian sol-
diers who fell in the Great Disturbance.
Even Labor-leader Charlton gave a grumpy
assent, with the prefix “Notwithstanding the
abhorrence which all feel for the war,” and
said the Hall would be a warning to future
generations “not to allow the experience we
had gone through to be repeated.” When
Prime Minister Fisher, with Hughes,
Pearce and Tudor, not to forget Charlton
himself, went to the country in the early
weeks of the war, they went with the cry
that Australia would “give its last man
and its last shilling” to save the world from
Hun domination. The party came back, in-
cluding Charlton, with its minority of one
turned into a majority of ten. But the
“white-ant” methods of Communists, I.W.W.
men and Hun agents were already at work,
and in the rapid decay which followed
Charlton became what he is.

“Lomara” : For a score of years Australia
lias realised that it has a problem in connec-
tion with the naming of its wines ; and the
difficulty has been brought to a head by the
international agreements that territorial
designations for certain vintages shall not be
infringed. The European attack on Aus-
tralia’s plagiarism dates from before the
beginning of the Commonwealth ; but wine-
makers have remained merely supine and
tearful. Yet Australia abounds in euphoni-
ous and often beautiful native names, which
might easily be given world-fame as wine-
brands—Tin tar a is an example ; Tanunda is
another. I know from years of selling Tin-
tara Burgundy that the former word could
have been established; but the superfluous
•‘Burgundy” was always stressed in labelling
and advertising. It is not too late to start
now.

“Ex-R.N.”: In a recent article on the Navy
(B. 3/9/’25), “Caractacus” talks about
“second loots,” and declares that “the
Navy, as far as Australia is concerned, is
a part-time job, despite the loyalty and en-
thusiasm of its (mostly English) officers.’
There are no second lieutenants in either the
R.N. or the R.A.N., and the June, 1925.
Navy List shows that of 273 commissioned
officers on the Active List of the R.A.N. only
52 —or less than 20 per cent. —are English.
“Caractacus” also cites cases of shop-
assistants, farmers, etc., who becaine colonels
and generals in the late war, and infers that
if such things are possible in the Army they
should also be possible in the Navy. Most
intelligent landsmen can, and did, master the
not very intricate science of trench-warfare
in a few months, but the science of sea-war-
fare, which is carried out on a different and
quite unfamiliar element, is another matter.
Actual examples of clerks and laborers who
rose to the ranks of post-captain and admiral
w ould have provided a more convincing argu-
ment. But perhaps these were not so easy
to find.
“Witcitetty” : The writer on “Education in
the North” (B. 21/5/’25) is more easily
satisfied than the majority of Northern
Territory parents are. In the last three
years one qualified teacher has been
appointed. The old staff still remain, more
than half of whom are not and never have
been qualified. As for the teaching given
the children, there are boys from the High
School who cannot repeat the nine times
table, who do not know how many parts of
speech there are, and whose writing and
spelling M r ould disgrace a southern third-
class child. Certainly, an inspector from
Queensland pays an annual visit, expresses
himself as well satisfied, and then goes back
again. But the parents have looked in vain
for any improvements, and few of them
bother to send their children to the High
School, deeming it merely a M’aste of time.
Those who can afford it send their children
south, where they will be sure of competent
teaching. In the first year the Queensland
scholarships were open to Territory children,
not one child was considered well enough edu-
cated to compete, even from the High School,
though the standard for it is only the Fifth
grade. This year four children entered, but,
though nearly four months have gone by, no
word of the results has yet reached Darwin.
No, education in the Territory is the poorest
apology for such a thing that the M 7 hole of
Australia can shoM 7 , nor is it likely to im-
prove till those in power have swept out the
time-servers who loaf on the Public Service,
and have put men and women in their places
who will M 7 ork for the good of the people.

“Flicker” : What a godsend the returned
soldier is to the loud-mouthed individuals
who want to discredit their equally loud-
mouthed opponents in any public contro-
versy ! Perhaps there is a prohibition refer-
endum. “What!” says Bung’s speaker.
“Did our brave men go and fight that on
their return they should find their liberty
taken from them?” “Shall it be said that
our heroes vanquished one tyrant to make
the world safe for the rule of the cursed
derrink importers?” shrieks Mr. Stiggins.
Or a national crisis may bring talk of special
legislation. “Did the flower of our manhood
endure four years of war, to hand over their
country to a lawless few?” inquires a sup-
porter of the Ministry. “Are you going to
allow that priceless heritage of freedom for
which our returned soldiers gave their lives
to be trampled in the mire by the fiery breath
of capitalism?” demands, in mixed meta-
phors, one of those gentlemen who seem to
get a percentage on strikes. “How dare the
idle rich pay £lOOO for a racehorse while
the men who saved the Empire are starving
in the streets?” asks some paper whose com
positors kept the job warm for returned
men during—and after —the war. “Why
don’t the unions think of the suffering caused
to the returned men by these arbitrary regu-
lations?” demands a journal whose, staff was
nearly all eligible—but indispensable. And
so it goes on. Surely the Ghosts, of Flan-
ders and Palestine must laugh tile eynical
Digger laugh—but not so cynical that there
is not a sob behind it—as their living cob-
bers starve in the midst of the plenty they
preserved, an example of the truth of the
saying “Everybody’s business is nobody’s
concern!”

POLITICAL
POINTS
Last week, while the Australian Labor
party was frothing at the mouth over the
‘‘unprecedented crime” of proposing to de-
port alien lawbreakers and industrial wreck-
ers, the United States Government refused
to let one Saklatvala land in the U.S.A. for
the purpose of attending a Parliamentary
Congress. Saklatvala is the dusky windbag
who, though Communist as well as Asiatic,
lias become British Labor M.P. for Batter-
sea. The embargo on Sak. was authorised
by Secretary-of-State Kellogg, with the ap-
proval of President Ooolidge. There are no
State Labor Premiers in the U.S.A. to
"test the constitutionality” of Federal laws
dealing with foreign-born Bolshies, but other
protests elicited, the following:—
• The Secretary of Labor, Mr. Davis, has been advised
by the solicitors of the Labor Department that the
IJ.S. immigration law clearly specifies that an alien
Communist may not lawfully enter nor remain in
the United States. Further, he is subject to exclusion
or deportation. *
In the shock of this announcement Charl-
ton, Lang and Gillies luaven’t yet decided
whether they will refuse tp borrow American
money or declare the Republic "black.”
The fuss that has been made about the
“rush” Federal election is quite unjustified.
The last election was held on December 16,
1922, so there will be tin interval of nearly
three years between the two polls. There
have been nine Parliametats since Federation.
The first was elected just on 24-£ years ago,
and the one now expiring has lived slightly
longer than the average time of 62 months
and 20 days. Besides, November will be
more convenient for country folk than De-
cember, especially in these days when they
have to vote or be fined.
George Fuller may be liest remembered as
the well-meaning Premier whose dawdling
habits cost N. S. Wales its second chamber.
The State's nominee house —the only one left
in Australia —is plainly doomed; the only
question is whether it shall disappear alto-
gether or be superseded by £tn elective cham-
ber. The Labor party wants to wipe it out
completely, and have no check upon the
Assembly that admittedly consists of mem-
bers largely elected by “crook” methods. Ful-
ler had tlie opportunity to interpose a cham-
ber elected by the people on a bi'oad franchise
—the sort of chamber that the Labor party
would hardly have dared to attack, and which
would probably have withstood its assault,
anyway. But he did nothing except leave the
position open to attack under the best possible
conditions for making a success of it.
Hughes is utterly opposed, he. says, to Com-
munism, but is equally opposed to the attempt
to deport two of the men who are parties to
the present dispute. But Walsh and Johan-
son are not parties to the present dispute: the
strikers don’t even belong to Walsh and
Johanson’s union. Anyhow, strikes are _ not
lawful in this country; and if the Law isn’t
to interpose when two men are breaking the
law r , when is it to interpose?
The Queensland Government, according to
the terms of its surrender to the railway
staff, is moving to establish a new basic
wage, varying from £4 ss. per week in the
south to £4 15s. in the north. The Arbitra-
tion Court, which is practically an obsolete
animal now, didn’t enter into the discussion.
The new wage is nothing exciting in itself,
but the rise from a £4 minimum is coinci-
dent with reduced hours, a general tendency
to hold stop-work meetings and restrict out-
put, and a probable increase in railway
charges. In the sugar-mills, thanks to the
prohibition of foreign competition, the value
of the work done per employee in the short
season was recently returned as £5OB, but
other industries yield on a very moderate
scale, and sudden shocks are sometimes fatal.
In fact, the last shock always is fatal.
AS IT IS DONE IN MELBOURNE .
“In entering a nolle prosequi in the cases of architect Davies, clerk of works Royal and contractor
Cooper who were commilted for trial on a charge of manslaughter arising out of the recent collapse
of a new concrete building, the Attorney-General (Mr. Eggleston) said that, although advice indicated
that there was no case against accused, ‘the situation disclosed was a very serious one. Grave defects
had occurred in the building of the premises, and owing to laxity of supervision a disaster had occurred.
FIRST MELBOURNE BUILDER: “ Cripos, Bill, don’t that wall look a lit crook to you?"
SECOND DITTO : "Gittin' pertikler, ain’t yer? Anfow, anythink jer peace. Give us an
’and an’ we'll shove her over a lit while the mortar’s wet.”
There w'as talk in the dailies last week
about the British shipping cos. bringing
“free” labor from England to man the ves-
sels laid up in Australia. It w r as stupid talk.
What do those cos. want “free” labor fort
They have no quarrel with the Seamen s
Union. It can’t be too strongly insisted on
that the men who have gone on strike in
Australia are rebels against their union; and
the Walshes and Johansons who encourage
them are enemies and underminers of the
solidarity they have talked so much about.
Although the N.S.W. Lang Government
regards its Forty-four Hour Bill as the most
important measure of the session, the House
had to be counted while Baddeley. who intro-
duced it, w\as w'restling with his second-
reading speech. At one time there were a
whole 10 Labor members listening to the
Minister’s exposition, but the listeners stole
away until only four were left. There were
pony races at Kensington that day, and pro-
fessional uplifters of the toiling masses can’t
be expected to give up their pony races even
for debates on work-reducing bills. Either
the Government will have to abandon day
sittings when they clash with the pony races
or arrange for the ponies to race by electric
light, like the Perth trotters.
Victoria is beginning to see a bit more
clearly that The Bulletin’s old abomina-
tion, the Party system, is a fraud on demo-
cracy. It finds that with only 13 members
in the Assembly and six in the Council the
Cocky party has managed to get the upper
hand'in the State Parliament. Such a demon-
stration of the possibilities of minority rule
has not been lost on the organisation itself.
The radical or “left” wing, which is a
minority in the conference and has less than
a third of the representation on the central
executive, actually made an attempt last
week to collar control.
Willis, who represents the Government in
N.S.W. Upper House, was scriptural and
almost Pecksnifiian in his introduction of the
bill for the abolition of capital punishment.
One of his quotations was the familiar “Ven-
geance is mine, 1 will repay, saith the
Lord,” which is an equally good argument
against fine, imprisonment, the declaring of
opponents “black” and the persecution of
Agents-General. Another was the equally
familiar “Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do.” The Willis
crowd has made a very poor hand
at forgiving the Fordsdale seamen who hesi-
tated about joining a vengeful strike, and in
any case it doesn’t propose to forgive the
homicide, but to lock him up. Misapplied
Scripture, coming out of an inappropriate
mouth, is unpleasant.
Tasmania has a birth-rate which is above
the average, and an infantile death-rate which
is below' it, yet, like the N. Territory, it
lias fewer inhabitants now than w T hen the
Navigation Act started. The Act shuts all
non-Australian ships out of the trade with
mainland ports, and Australian shipping is
just as reliable as the chronic strike move-
ment permits. As the spasmodic blockade
is utterly disastrous, a big league is formed,
or forming, to demand that the island be
exempted from the Act. It would cause the
Federal Government some trouble to grant
this request, but if the islanders can show
clearly that it would cost a great deal more
trouble to refuse they will get what they ask.
From Queensland :
As though the outlook for Charlton’s crowd wasn’t
black enough in Queensland, Alderman Jack Fihelly
must go and arrange with the Conservative Courier
for the publication of articles “From Labor’s Point
of View.” In the first of these, written under the
impression that the Commonwealth election would
take place in March or April instead of November,
the ex-Treasurer supplied the other side with some
first-class electioneering matter. Of his former col-
leagues’ handling of the railway trouble he wrote
that the “mentally oblique” Cabinet “seemed to
just blunder along, showing a firm hand to-day and
shaking at the knees to-morrow.” Also, “that acre
or so of Stetson hats that gathered under the eaves
of the Premier’s office to proclaim their wrongs to
the ribald world left me unmoved.” The writer will
presently be under the painful necessity of appealing
to the “acre or so of Stetson hats” for votes
he is the Labor candidate for Brisbane. Referring to
Theodore, who is Labor candidate for Herbert (inci-
dentally, he is finding Dr. Nott a much tougher pro-
position than seemed likely before the sugar farmers
were plagued by strikes and the raising of the basic
wage by Act of Parliament), Fihelly holds that
person primarily responsible for the railway strike
and derides him for saying he wasn’t “interested -n
the strike.” In short, Fihelly’s contribution to
political journalism has placed more obstacles in
the path of the Queensland Labor candidates, him-
self included, and Heaven knows the road was rocky
enough.
On a snap division, taken on a motion for
the adjournment, the Allan-Peacock Compo.
Ministry found itself two short in the Vie.
Assembly last week. Nine Ministerial sup-
porters were absent in pursuance of the_ go-
as-you-please attitude members on the right
of the Speaker have been adopting since the
beginning of the session. Of the nine five
were Libs., three Cockies and one Ind. Lib.
Three were ill, but there was little excuse
for the others. They had to be black-listed
and got the kind of ad. they didn t want.
Toutcher, a Radical-Lib., who had moved the
adjournment on a grievance of dismissed
and disrated railway employees, can’t be too
well pleased with the result. Instead of
climbing out when Railway Minister Eggles-
ton gave him an opening, he went to a divi-
sion with 27 Laborites. The Ministry had
to stand a gibe pr two on the following day,
but Peacock was quick enough to remind
Labor’s leader that his idol Ramsay Mac-
donald had to take ten or a dozen such kicks
from the Commons when he was J. Bull’s
Grand Vizier for a season.
►S.A. railway men have decided on a digni
fied protest against their present working
hours, which often total up to nine and a halt'
at country stations. They are not talking
strike, but have informed Premier Gunn,
who is his own Minister of Railways, that
it seems mere sarcasm for them to take part
in the coming Eight Hours’ Day procession,
and they intend to stay away from it.
The “memorial” re Australian citizens as
State Governoi's is now presumably on the
way to London, the Westralian Premier
having been instructed to put it in the letter-
box after signing it. It has been laid before
no Parliament, and, except to the various
Labor Governments, the contents are a mys-
tery. It is quite certain, though, that it
isn’t desired to have Excellencies chosen by
the people, and it is pretty certain that they
are not to be chosen by Parliament. Whether
the appointment is intended to be a matter
for secret diplomacy in caucus, or whether,
•when Labor is in power, conference or some
such body will take the business out of the
hands of Caucus, and whether the selection
will be practically limited to members, or
whether applications from union secretaries
and others will be considered, are all matters
for the future.
An instance of the crude bitterness of the
“class war” was the outburst of the Bathurst
branch of the Boilermakers’ Union because
the Eight Hours Committee invited the
Mayor of Bathurst (wlm happens to be the
selected Nationalist candidate for next elec-
tions) to the annual dinner. That sort of
larrikin attitude was not tolerated in older
days, even when the bittei'est feeling pre-
vailed. For instance, though N.S.W. Pre-
mier Wade was in most violent opposition to
the unions, he was invited to (and attended)
the Sydney Eight Hours dinner. A hot-
headed movement against the invitation was
coldly but resolutely checked by the domi-
nant trades unionists of the day. who main-
tained that the greater courtesy they showed
their opponents the more chance they hail
of turning them into friends.
Dear Bulletin, —I notice that the Un-
speakable Turk, about whose qualities as a
man and brother Tom Skeyhill wrote feel-
ingly in a recent Bulletin, is on the Chris-
tian-extirpation and girl-abduction game in
Asia again. Abdul has been reforming all
my life, and my father’s life, and previously,
but the rule remains unchanged that a dead
Turk is the one good Turk. A dying flicker
of maudlin philanthropy was aroused when
he lately decided to abandon the fez and
wear a hat, but though he wore three hats
at once he would be no better, and would
probably try to be worse. —Yours, etc., H.H.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Under the Commonwealth electoral laws, the
Commonwealth Government subsidises postmen to the
extent of one half-penny for every elector whose
name they cause to be placed on or removed from
the electoral roll.” —Honorary Minister Marr in the
House oi Reps.
The “postie” whistles merrily, a-biking to and fro.
J often used to wonder why, but now I think I
know.
His occupation looks the kind of job that palls and
irks;
It seems a “dull demnition grind”—but don’t forget
the perks!
For every Jane and every Bill —bloke, stripling,
damsel, dame—
His efforts can induce to fill in an electoral claim,
The “postie” draws a ha’penny, a ha’penny, a
ha’penny,
A bright and gleaming ha’penny,
A ha’penny a name!
He notes it, as he well may do, when locals hit the
breeze
For woods and pastures fresh—in new electoral
boundaries.
Account him not a stickybeak who asks you if your
son
Or daughter isn’t within a week or so of twenty-one.
He totes the mail through ruts and holes to leave
it at your doors,
And in the evenings long the rolls assiduously ex-
plores,
Knowing it’s worth a ha’penny, a ha’penny, a
ha’penny,
A round and ringing ha’penny,
For every point he scores.
The bookie shows a jovial elm where there are lambs
to skin;
It looks a calling' lucrative —-but favorites sometimes
win.
The chaps who’re sent to Parliament for legislative
feats
Have lots of ways their screw to raise—and yet may'
lose their seats.
But the “postie” whistles on his round with confidence
sublime,
lie little reeks of heavy ground or aching hills to
climb ;
For every person he can note who’s eligible for
a vote,
Or should from off the roll be wrote to clear it of
its grime.
He knows he’ll snare a ha’penny, a ha’penny, a
ha’penny,
A sterling copper ha’penny,
A ha’penny a time 1

The Act of U>24 defined the bank’s pur-
poses and (more or less) its activities, and
slowly the institution is shaping itself on
the linos therein laid down. But although
its function is to maintain the country s
reserves and fix the discount rate, it has
shown a wise resolve to recognise the very
important part the great private banks play
in the finance of Australia. The Board,
therefore, moves slowly: thus far, for in-
stance, it has not proclaimed the rates at
which it will discount and rediscount bills.
But this will come; for a rediscount market
would keep banking reserves mobile and
advance tlie bank another step towards what
was aimed at in the Act —that it should be
a central reserve bank.
June deposits (the deposits are largely on
Government account) bear the mark of the
tax-collector, although part of the increase
of £6,157,953 over the December total con-
sisted of deposits made by the trading banks.
Savings bank deposits also increased. Here
are three June comparisons:—
1915. 1924. 1925.

Ordinary
deposits, etc. £8,547,526 £31,914,902 35,155,565

Government deposits are not separated from
the others in the accounts, so an appraisement
of progress and activities is impossible. For
this continued balance-sheet reticence there
seems no necessity, more particularly since
the bank lias been definitely shaped under
the 1924 Act. Movements in assets were:—
1915. 1924. 1925.

fixed deposits of
other banks .. £5,324,668 £7.270,047 £10,946.07S

Premises .. 128,576 901,667 887,553
Here there has been favorable movement
throughout. Decreases are visible in money
in London and in tlie book value of pre-
mises. Of the increases the £3,676,031 ex-
pansion in coin, bullion and cash balances
compared with June, 1924, is due chiefly to
deposits of gold by banks. Australian notes
are £8,093,297 greater than at December, and
£4,521,218 greater than in the previous June.
Here is the influence of the taxation pay-
ments plus deposits by banks, the latter in
£lOOO notes. But in all the movements is
visible tlie influence of favorable conditions
throughout Australia which have made for
expansion.
Profits from the Note Issue Department
for the six months amounted to £578.578.
The first balance-sheet was published in
December, 1923, and profits have been : De-
cember, 1923, £711,761; June. 1924.
£552,822: December, 1924, £699,397; and
June, 1925, £578,575. All the profits of
this Department go to the Commonwealth
Treasury; half the profits of tlie banking
business go to the National Debt Sinking
Fund, the other half being maintained in
the bank’s reserves. Notes in circulation
were three millions less (£53,890,226) ; gold
coin and bullion were £25.841.027; deben-
tures and other securities. £27,574,106; and
other assets, £475,093. The proportion of
gold to notes was 47.9 p.c.
During tho half-year and since it ended
the management has had to face considerable
criticism, in Parliament and out of it. The
bulk of it has been very ill-informed. The
most serious revolved around J. .1. Garvan,
the chairman of the Board, who is managing
director also of a life-insurance office—the
M.L.C. In both of tlie matters that have
been brought up he has been pilloried for
things that arc really to his credit. In the
days when Australia was struggling hard
to raise war loans, Garvan (and this was
nine or ten years before lie had anything to
do with the bank except as a customer) said
that, though his co. had exhausted all the
money it had in hand, it was prepared to
pledge its income for 10 years ahead if the
Commonwealth Bank cared to advance the
money. Naturally, the bank agreed, especi-
ally as it was to got 1 p.c. more than other
hanks were charging their war-loan clients.
By the time Garvan became a director and
chairman of the bank, the M.L.C. had re-
paid about £10,000.000. and a few months
afterwards, the last penny having been paid,
the account was closed. That was one
matter. The other related to the transfer
of money to Australia from London. Garvan,
who had joined the old Notes Board, was
strongly opposed to the increase of the note
circulation; and in order to ease the strain,
and thus weaken the cry for more notes, he s
undertook to use the machinery of his co.
to bring money to Australia. The records
show that not a penny was paid for the ser-
vice ; it is obvious that Garvan did it in
order to avert the necessity for issuing more
notes, which he believed would be a national
calamity. The Board has thus come through
the first attack made upon it with credit to
itself; and this is something on which the
Commonwealth may be congratulated. Some
of the politicians have never ceased to lament
that the bank was put outside their control:
and a successful attack on management
by an independent Board would have been
a great help to them.

It seems a modest div., despite the one-point
improvement. But the modesty vanishes when
the chapter which bisects the introductory
table is read. And those who, through fore-
sight or good fortune, got in early have had
a royal time. In 1903 paid capital was
£25.000. Within the next seven years capi-
tal had expanded to £211,212, of which bonus
issues supplied £181,877. the balance (£4335)
representing some interminable debentures
exchanged for half the face value in shares.
Capital did not change up to the reconstruc-
tion 10 years later, but the co.’s customers,
besides providing healthy divs., had presented
it with a fleet of splendid steamers as well
as fat additions to liquid assets. However, the
rich returns belong to the past. Certainly
divs. can hardly be expected to move rapidly,
and the future is not likely to sec any dupli-
cation of the old achievements. The market,
however, views the scrip with favor, probably
influenced as much by retrospect as prospect.
Disclosed profits, as usual, approximated div.
requirements; in point of fact they were a
few pounds under. But the £29,503 claimed
by the accounts was what remained after
provision had been made for depreciation and
£7OO added to reserves, which was not
credited to earnings. Whether the £30,203
was the full extent of profits or whether the
true amount was less depends on the
adequacy of that provision. The co. in earlier
years erred on the conservative side, as sub-
sequent happenings proved. The 1920 valu-
ation by Captain Spinks was made at the
peak of the post-war boom, and it is not
likely that the Port Jackson Co. Board would
be unmindful of tlie need to get book values
and replacement costs in close relation.
Balance-sheet figures point to a recognition
of that necessity :
1922. 1924. 1925.
Liquid assets .. £45,961 £58,948 £76,833
Liabilities .. .. 47,432 17.002 8,440
Excess liabilities. . £1,471
Surplus assets ... £41,946 £68,393
Fixed assets .. £440,525 £404,010 £380,308
The reduction of sundry creditors by £7098
on the year was the fourth consecutive cut.
Overdraft was only £BO4 lower at £4552.
As regards the valuation of the steamers,
what is more important than the figure
at which they appear in the books is
their prospective profit-earning capacity.
That depends on a continuance of traffic
rights. But there is only a remote likeli-
hood of anything adverse so long as the Co.
maintains service equal to that of the past.
Meantime costs, have gone up and are not
likely to come down very far, and with the
growing popularity of the great number of
pleasure resorts within easy distance of Syd-
ney—the most richly-endowed city, in that
respect, in the world—fares appear to have
been lifted to the maximum. And the separa-
tion of the insurance business —the co. for-
merly carried all its own risks—has cut off
a source ol profit. Prior to the reconstruc-
tion small losses and the interest from insur-
ance funds assisted earnings. They now go
to the pup co. which emerged out of the 1920
reconstruction.

This is the subsidiary of the Port Jack-
son and Manly Steam which emerged from
the 1920 reconstruction. It was formed to
take over tlie insurance risks and started off
with goodwill £17,008. That, however, was
quickly reduced and now reserves total £9457
in excess of the amount of goodwill in the
books. The usual comfortable profit was
made, only 60 p.e. of it being distributed.
Risks are slight—the limit of public risk
is £l2 per ton, so that in the ease of a
collision between two steamers a maximum
of £12,000 would be involved. Replacement
would, of course, be a different matter.

Tlie div. for the last half was at the rate of
9 p.c.; and then more than a third of the
year’s disclosed profit was sent to reserves.
Out of the debauch of loan money started
by the first Labor Governments and con-
tinued through the war years and since, this
co. has reaped wonderful profits. In 1910
capital was £51,900; on June 30 last it was
£313,724, yet shareholders have not been
called on for a single shilling. Even on the
watered and re-watered capital, last year’s
net income was equal to 12.8 p.c. A 10 p.c.
div. would have left £8786 for reserves; and
some Boards would have paid if, seeing that
visible and other accumulations are so sub-
stantial that large additions are not called
for. The fact of the Board lifting the rate
to 9 p.c. may be a hint that it begins to feel
in a more generous mood.
Here are grouped balance-sheet figures
back to 1915 :
Property Cash
and and In-
Liabilities. Advances. Premises, vestments.
1915.. £49,324 £224,499 £57.947 £6,863
1920.. 25,947 289,499 84,740 86.896

1925.. 18,428 405,333 81,379 44,271
A shrinkage of £5534 in deposits accounted
for most of the contraction in liabilities. In
the assets, borrowers’ and purchasers’ balances
moved forward by £25,904. The decrease in
liabilities, although remarkable for a land
and building investment co., is not surpris-
ing in the case of the Intercolonial, whoso
financing has never been heavily dependent
on outsiders. The small amount owing on
June 30 was covered by cash and Govern-
ment securities amounting to £44,271.
advances with a book value of £405,333 and
freeholds, materials and furniture of £81,379.
After providing for liabilities and the final
div. there were tangible assets equal to 30s.
4d. for each £ of capital. Conditions are
now less favorable for house and land sell-
ing, but the management of the Intercolonial
is not likely to miss a single beat of the
market pulse. Nor is it likely to lose much,
if anything, on its advances; for, though the
tide is running out, no sudden contraction
in values is threatened, and it is only the
sudden contraction which sends cos. like this
sprawling, though, of course, something much
less violent is able to shrivel the profits.

A record was to be expected. The directors
promptly lifted the div. a couple of points
even though the increased capital called for
75 p.c. of the profit. That smells like opti-
mism ; for the wool prices of last year are
not likely to be repeated, and the co. is not
in the position of older firms which have
big accumulations to come and go on. Pro-
gress since the formation, of the co. has been
promising. Registered in May, 1919, it
amalgamated the businesses of Bennett and
Fisher and Oheadle, Crase and Co. Pre-
liminary exes, of £l3BB were quickly wiped
off out of profits. Goodwill appeared in the
first accounts at £27.000; it is now lumped
with “freeholds, leaseholds, shares, plant and
furniture, and stocks on hand, £107,986.*'
Such a grouping of assets is confusing, and
the Board should itemise it. On the other
side is this entry: “Sundry creditors and all
other liabilities, less cash in hand, £306,333."
Investors won’t get much real information
out of that either. Thanks to the increase
of capital, the massed creditor item
( £306.333) is only £32,543 greater than it
was a year ago, notwithstanding that
advances and book debts called for £94.850
more, the result no doubt of the heavy carry-
over of wool. The co. has a solid connection
and a Board that commands S. Australian
confidence, and it is possible that it may
pull in enough new business to maintain the
10 p.c. But if it can earn 10 p.c. on all
the new money which has been subscribed
during the past two or three years, and at
the same time make adequate provision for
the slack years which this class of business
inevitably meets, it will do astonishingly well.
Last year’s profit is certainly not a fair
guide; Yorkshire doesn’t go mad very often.
On the other hand, it is possible, of course,
that the real profit for the period was much
greater than the directors show; so the
safest thing in connection with a wool-
handling co. is to disregard the 1924-25 pub-
lished figures altogether. Capital on .Tunc
30 was £300.000, increased since the close
of the accounts by the issue of £150,000 of
74 p.c. cum. profs, which were promptly
taken up.

A progressive concern this and growing
stronger. In 1917 it branched out to Gee-
long. and a few years la'tep opened in Mel-
bourne, where it last year bought a free-
hold for £23,500. The deal accounts for the
issue of 5000 new shares paid to 255. at a
premium of 10s. This will increase paid
capital to £37,500. If the 12 p.c. div. is
continued it will now call for £4500. Last
year’s profits could do it easily. Total funds
of £70,000 will be at work oyer most of the
present term, and if they average only 34
p.c. investments will return £2450. As the
value of the trusts administered is over
£4,500,000, a good bit more than the other
£2050 should come from that 1 source. And
the source is growing: ten years ago trust
funds in hand amounted to only £1,941,596.
Although shareholders are getting a nice re-
turn—£lo,ooo of the £31,250 of paid capital
came from bonus issues—clients are getting
the attention of experts backed by a solid
guarantee that they will run straight.

Borneo Oil Syndicate (W.A.) is negotiat-
ing for a further year’s extension of its
option and is offering another instalment ot
£2OOO on account of purchase consideration
as an inducement for the vendors to say
yes'. At a shareholders’ meeting held in
Perth the other day, managing-director Mick
Williams stated that as soon as finances per-
mitted a series of trial bores would be put
down on the co.’s concessions, and he was
certain oil would be struck at shallow depths.

Monte Carlo Bank Co. (W.A.) is again
having its prospects puffed by the Board
in the hope of reviving a down-and-out
market and inducing jibbing shareholders to
pay calls. This time it is stated that several
thousand tons of ounce ore awaits extrac-
tion in the waterlogged workings of the co. s
Field Find leases; but the market, remem-
bering past reports, is uninterested.

Westralia has produced about millions
worth of minerals other than gold, about half
of it copper and tin and the other half
mostly lead and coal. At present copper-
and tin-mining is a myth, and the quantity
of lead produced by the gagers at North-
ampton isn’t much. Coal-mining, confined to
Collie, is active, but in a small way. An
attempt is being made to open up another
coalfield at Wilga, near Collie, which is
estimated to contain 200.000,000 tons spread
over 24 square miles. Wilga coal is declared
to be as good as Collie, and just as favor-
ably situated in the matter of railway. But
according to Government experts it would be
risky, if not foolish, to open up new col-
lieries in the West while the system of high
prices, low outputs and sharing of (mostly
Government) trade by arrangement instead
of by competition persists at Collie.

Boulder No. 1 (W.A.) surrendered its
Boulder block a year or two ago, and on
several occasions since then has told its share-
holders that it has not yet found a mine
worth attention. Recently a local syndicate
which had been working the aforesaid sur-
rendered lease took out some good crushing®
and exposed a new ore body which, according
to Kalgoorlie mining men, is a good thing
that Boulder No. 1 missed.

Ives Reward Co. (W.A.) has often boasted
about the big tonnages of ore awaiting treat-
ment, and just as often has broadcasted .tales
of equally large quantities of partially-
developed stuff. Now, after milling at a
loss for a little while, it is announced that
the battery has got ahead of the mine, and
that two shifts are to be worked instead of
three. A word or two is added about the
property being well handled, and the co.
hoping shortly to crush its way to prosperity,
but The Bulletin still has doubts.

“Geologist”: The plea of “Nothing Mat-
ters” (B. 10/9/’2o) is sound regarding the
withdrawal of the subsidy for petroleum and
the subsidising of boring and geological sur-
veying—these represent the recommendations
of the recent Federal Geological Congress
but unsound when he advocates large sums
being spent on scout-boring over wide areas
in the different States which have shown
little, if anything, in their favor. What is
wanted at present is intensive prospecting
of one or two of the most favorable areas.
Oil prospecting is such a costly business that
the Commonwealth should not spread its
efforts over too wide an area at the one time.
Try Prices Creek (W.A.) and the Long-
reach-Roma belt (Q.). Let the latter be
No. 1 test, because it is the only area in Aus-
tralia that has so far given evidence of ex-
tensive collection of petroleum and its deri-
vatives. It has practically been proved that
Longreach bore would be a gusher of some
sort. Then why stop simply because it
proved to be an oil of low commercial value?
* * * *
“Tliersites” terms it a “scientific joke” :
Before administering an awkward tap on the solar
plexus of the Australian petroleum industry, Dr.
Wade in his farewell report delivered a heavy
English joke. He says the search for oil along our
southern coast was due to the finding- of vagrant
lumps of bitumen on the beaches of the four southern
States. Keith Ward, the S.A. State geologist, _ be-
lieves this floating bitumen came here from Trinidad,
ap island in the West. Indies, his idea apparently
being that it has been carried hither on ocean
currents, around corners, against trade winds, across
equatorial tides. Wade thinks the stuff was origin-
ally buried in barrels by whalers in the old times.
There must have been a thundering lot of whaling
ships in Australian waters, then, for I personally
have found soft bitumen as big as a piano-case
near Kingston (S.A.) ; picked it up on the Shelly
Beach, Warrnambool (Vic.) ; found it inland on the
Coorong; seen it on Bruni Island, s.-w. Tasmania ;
also near Albany, "King George’s Sound, Westralia,
and had it sent to me from the head of the Aus-
tralian Bight. My own opinion is that this as-
phaltum, which is merely solidified petroleum, lies
on the floor of the continental shelf off the southern
coast of Australia, and is detached by violent
upheavals and earth tremors. Being as dense and
heavy as Dr. Wade’s joke, most of it sinks to
the bed of the ocean. Some, however, floats to the
surface, to be carried to the beaches, there to
encourage enthusiasts in the search for the oil-beds
from which it had its origin.

Golden Lily, Aberfeldy (Vic.), still lacks
the battery which was to have sung its song
six months ago. When it starts it will use
ore from the middle reef which ranges up
to 40 inches wide at the bottom tunnel, and
is sampled to go about an ounce. At the
surface is 740 tons of ore, upon which the
stamps will start. The question is how long
will it be before the mill will catch up with
ore reserves. These, no matter how mea-
sured up, are on the small side.

After a lapse of years South Comet, one
of the Speck’s ancients, is to be given an-
other chance. It would have remained a
has-been if lead and zinc had not stuck so
well above £3O as to afford some reason for
the second advent of moribund Zeehan lead
shows. At the moment the top and bottom
tunnels are being got ready for the good
work. Some fair-grade zinc ore shows oft
the lower level, and to give the co. a proper
shove off the Speck’s Mines Department is
letting the co. have at a nominal price the
rusty old Comet mill which has been idle
for so long at a siding. Jig and table treat-
ment will be relied on at first, but the pro-
gramme is to lead up to flotation operations.
* * * *
The rush to the Speck’s osmiridium fields
continues, notwithstanding the warnings of
those already there and of the disillusioned
ones who have returned. Already nearly
800 miners’ rights have been taken out,, a
big proportion by men unacquainted with
even the ABC of the business. A few days
ago two new arrivals created a diversion.
The wardrobe of one consisted of a tony
macintosh, and his swag was a handbag and a
kitchen shovel. The other’s whole equipment
was a hayfork and a tin dish.

TJnder-Sec. Mance and Chief Inspector
Jaquet, of the N.S.W. Mines Department,
visited Tinglia and made an inspection of
the work being done by the Hydraulic Tin
Mines, Ltd., the London-controlled co.
formed to take over Jim Syme’s rights and
leases thereabout. The water scheme is de-
signed to obtain the right pressure for cheap
hydraulic mining. A race will carry the flow
from King’s Mountain, four miles from
Tingha, to Mordeun Creek, 17 miles away.
The Mordeun rises in the high and well-
watered area about Ben Lomond. It rarely
ceases running, and has a very big flow m
flood. Two dams on Mordeun are being put
in, and another is designed for New Valley
Creek. Forecasts give the New Year as the
date about which these catchments will be
ready to supply fluid for sluicing purposes.

Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) improvement
underground was reflected in the yield of
104 tons concentrates from 1087 tons as
against 6*l tons from 917 tons of ore for the
previous four weeks. The new make of ore
reported in the western prospecting drive
proved only a bunch, and driving has ceased.
No. 4 pipe in Smith’s workings is still being
sunk on 10 p.c. ore, but Atkinson himself
certifies that “handling becomes increasingly
difficult.”

The No. 2 dredge at Adelong Gold Estates
(N.S.W.) confirms the correctness of the
“Y” and “Z” series of bores, and the pity
of it is that the co.’s ground is so nearly
worked out. Since July the weekly yields
have usually been well over the hundred
ounces. The first week of August gave
1540 z. and the two September returns to date
171 oz. and 208 oz. # #
Carpathia, Ardlethan (N.S.W.), made
£4475 net for the year ended July 31; but
the contribution of the second half was a
loss of £607. Out of the £5082 earned in
the first six months a 6d. dividend toox
£2601. In that period 1203 tons gave 1 4
tons concentrates, the ore averaging 4.46 p.c.;
1532 tons for the remaining six months
gave only 41 tons concentrates, averaging
2.15 p.c. Mine earnings of £5874 were
swamped by £5499 expended there in the
process, and that and the administrative
expenses left the shortage above mentioned.
The co. has a working capital of £40,4Z1,
but of this £30,000 is in 60,000 paids, actual
sinews being provided by the 44,020 contnbs.
paid to 7s. There is £4613 at fixed deposit,
while ore and stores are put in at £34U6.
David Milne, late senior mines-mspector
for N.S.W., is to make a report.
Clive Cooper made a slick float of the
Macdonnell Ranges mica and metal leases ot
820 acres ottered by Fred Terry under option
from North Australian Development Ltd.,
Adelaide. Although, it is claimed that the
leases are all-rounders, containing Sold,
silver, lead and abestos, besides mica, the
intention is to concentrate on the last-named
for a start. To that end Bill Mclntyre, a
Hill End veteran, will advance on the Mac-
donnell Ranges as soon as preliminaries are
completed. The co. just floated is in 160,000
4s. shares, of which 65,000 paids go to tlio
vendors. Adelaide took 30,000 of the po.OOO
contribs. and wanted more. The co. is also
to pay a quite excessive £BOOO in cash —
£5500 in instalments extending over a year,
and £2500 out of mica won. Development
on the leases is mostly confined to open cuts,
and in two of these the face is 16ft. wide by
12ft. high, “the faces of both cuts being
studded with books of mica.” The problem
is being approached by motor-tractor from
Oodnadatta through Alice Springs.
After working the old Blount Jackson gold
show, near Georgetown (N.Q.), for close on
two years as a silver-lead proposition, F.
Cuthbert has decided to close down. Values
did not come up to expectations.

More activity is showing on the Stanhills
tinfield (N.Q.). A South Aus. co. has taken
an option over the Mauretania leases, and
is to commence operations almost imme-
diately. The Comet has been cleaned out and
retimbered, and at present is showing a pay-
able shoot of ore. Sinking has also been
started on a couple of other good-looking
prospects. * , *
All recent development work in the Duke
mine, Ravenswood (N.Q.), is looking hope-
ful, and on the present low rate of produc-
tion, contributed to by the smallness of the
reef, there seems to be some years’ work
ahead on stone averaging about £2O a ton.
It looks good enough for dividends now, but
expenses will have to be watched if the
run is to continue profitable. The shoot is
averaging 6in. wide over 100 ft. between the
Nos. 5 and 6 levels, and there is plenty of
virgin ground below No. 6.

Mt. Isa, Ltd., is about to start with its
percussion drill at long last. It was ex-
pected to get this in use several months ago,
but strikes and accidents caused delay. Oor-
bould anticipated cutting the Black Star-Ibus
lode at about 550 ft., and the drill is ex-
pected to pass through the footwall at about
1100 ft. It will thus hit the lode somewhere
near the level where No. 2 Prop, bore bot-
tomed. Although the big co.’s new bore will
indicate whether surrounding leases are
likely to be wanted in the distant future, it
is scarcely necessary for present development
work, considering the estimates of enormous
tonnages officially given out by the co. for
the first couple of hundred feet. The Ibus
bore has shown that the lode hasn’t pinched
out —to 600 ft., anyway. George Gray takes
over the mine-superintendent’s job in a
couple of weeks.

From the bottom of its new winze the
Great Northern, Herberton (Q.), has broken

M.L. Minister for Mines thinks that some
of the subsidiary cos. in the Ivawarau gamble
have been a bit wild in their claims. The
Minister calls them to order in his annual
statement presented to the Dominion Parlia-
ment a few weeks ago :
Misleading statements have been made in prospec-
tuses issued by the promoters of subsidiary cos. in
Australia. It was stated that the Kawarau Gold
Mining Co. (the parent concern) had obtained a
license from the Mines Department, issued by the
Warden at Queenstown and sanctioned by the Min-
ister of Mines, to dam Lake Wakatipu, which state-
ment is not correct. The license did not require my
consent or sanction. It was also stated that the co. s
undertaking had for its purpose the shutting-off of
Lake Wakatipu from the Kawarau in order to lay-
bare the bed of the river. This statement is greatly
exaggerated, as the damming of Lake Wakatipu could
not by any stretch of imagination lay bare the bed
of the river. [ Other streams and rivers now into
the Kawarau.l It was also stated in prominent let-
tering that the scheme had been hall-marked by the
Government, which statement is also contrary to fact.
The Minister was not so careful in his choice
of words when he performed the ceremony
of “firing the first shot” in the construction
of the dam. Said he then :
The present venture might be considered ambitious,
but he believed it would be successful The Gov-
ernment had assisted the promoters in every way.
It looks as though the Minister is regretting
his interest in the big gamble. Possibly he
has been influenced by the gradual decline ot
the shares of the rvirent concern, which lately
were quoted at 12s. (buyers) They were
double this figure a few months ago. lhe
finding of gold in the vicinity, variously
described as “thimblesful and tablespoons-
ful of fine gold,” has, however, given a fillip
to the market.
* * * *
One of the directors of Kawaran (M.L.)
has returned to Sydney from an inspection.
“The construction of the dam is progressing
favorably, and the engineer expects, in the
absence of any unforeseen contingencies, to
complete the work in November. « was
July in the flotation literature. But a little
soothing-syrup is added: “Quite recently,
during a low-level period of the m er, claims
have been prospected by the owners, and
some promising finds of gold reported. The
report doesn’t say whose claims.

“Forest Gate”: While waiting, his turn
to embark for home after the war,
a Digger at Sutton Veny camp (Wilts)
met his affinity, and applied for the
usual 10 days’ marriage leave. The
day before it was to be granted he was
informed that he’d have to show £2O as evi-
dence that he was properly equipped for
matrimony. As a matter of fact the money
was in process of being cabled to him, but
the proof he had was regarded as insufficient,
and as his paybook failed to supply evidence
of assets, something had to be done quickly.
It was done all right. On such occasions
the “best man” was always allowed six days’
leave, so the resourceful Digger raffled the
position—l6o members at 2s. 6d. apiece—
and had the cash to show next morning.

he nodded his head towards a departing

“Bildad” : Opinion is divided as to whether
Conan Doyle’s recent lecture in Paris will
give spiritualism a lift or a setback. The
author of “The Hound of the Baskervilles”
was to discourse on our disembodied relatives,
a subject on which he is reputed to know at
least as much as anybody since the Witch of
Endor, and to illustrate it with lantern slides
of ghosts w'hich had called on him. It was
a great gathering of international spookists,
and much was expected. Unfortunately the
show r went to the dogs early, some photos
being blanks, some blots, and some revealing
misty and grotesque figures standing on their
heads. One theory is that the Conan Doyles
and Oliver Lodges have been for years rais-
ing figments of their heated imagination,
and that there are no spooks, after all. An-
other is that bad spirits, whose hatred of
good ones would naturally be ferocious, had
broken in and made hay of the apparatus,
thus proving that there are a durned sight
too many spirits, and many of them probably
without licenses. Conan Doyle is aged only
66, and isn’t suspected of being in his dotage
yet, but some of the spectres, particularly
the Witch of Endor, must be old enough to
know’ better.

“Dikalo” (British Solomons) : My latest
Bulletins show ' “Centurion” and “Cartot”
and others arguing about the “ordeal by
water” as if it were a purely mediaeval
amenity. As a matter of fact, it was common
enough in the Philippines less than a quarter
of a century ago. When Uncle Sam took
up the job of policing the islands after the
Spanish War he found the natives adept in
guerilla warfare. After being potted all day
by ambushed marksmen, an American column
would force its way to a little village and
find everyone busy working in the rice- and
banana-fields. A search of the village always
failed to bring arms to light, but the snip-
ing would begin again as soon as the troop-
ers’ backs were turned. Hence the “water
cure” came into vogue as a means of extract-
ing information. Usually the presidente or
headman of the village had the persuasion
applied to him. Stretched out on the ground,
with a short length of bamboo forced into
his mouth, water was poured into him till
he disclosed the whereabouts of the hidden
arms. When the subject seemed full, a gentle
massage of the stomach with the butt of a
rifle always made room for more water. The
advantage of this kind of treatment was that
there would be no fatal result; after a few
hours’ discomfort the victim would recover
and show no evidence of the drastic methods.
Cocoanut-oil was used in a few cases, but
MOST ARTISTIC.
THE ARTIST: “Have you seen the Spring show yet?"
THE PHILISTING : “Oh, yes, it's lovely; I ordered two huts and three dresses."
this was too severe, death sometimes result-
ing. Ultimately, however, word went home to
Uncle Sam about these practices, and the
matter was brought up in Congress. Court-
martials followed, and the form of duress
fell into disfavor.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Who’ll join me in a
kick? Several firms that are entrusted with
the work of supplying entertainment from
the broadcasting stations (I’m writing from
Melbourne) get a substantial whack out of
the broadcasting fees; and in return they
stuff us up to the neck with advts. Excerpts
from theatrical shows are transmitted to
whet the appetite; a man who makes an
address on matters of interest to motorists
seems obsessed with the idea that there is
only one company’s petrol on the market;
when an orchestra tunes up wo are informed
that it plays at So-and-So’s emporium ; the
gramophone records put on are dll of the
one brand, to be obtained at .Squeakem’s;
and the other night the broadcasting co.’s
tame humorist sang us a song which was
mainly about chewing-gum. He mentioned
whose chewing-gum it was, too, with
sistency which suggested a good fee or great
enthusiasm. Broadcasting as a novelty i,s an
enthusiasm just now ; but better programmes,
giving less in the advertising Spirit, are
wanted if the business is not allowed to
fall Into disrepute.

“Taialia” : What tricks memory serves us !
Posted as gas-guard at the mouth of an
Arras sap, where the M.L. Tunnellers
worked in 1917, Jack Hardy was questioned
as to his duty in the event of an attack.
“Haven’t the foggiest.” he told the officer.
The yarn was retailed to me at Torquay in
1918 by an intimate of Hardy’s. The fol-
lowing year, entering a country pub in the
Poverty Bay district (M.L.) with an in-
quiry as to whether a certain short-cut was
open, I was met in the dim religious light
of the commercial-room with the same re-
sponse, and, solely on impulse, greeted my
vis-a-vis as. Hardy. It was. Hardy, and 1
had never met him before and didn’t know
where he was.

a few months after marriage his wife in-
formed him that she would be boss. He
would not stand that, and she left him.
She stayed away; lie mourned his loss,
Her words the parting of their ways;
The gold of love was tinned to dross
And Cupid vanished at that phrase.
But they’ve indeed more cause to grieve
Whose wives say it —and do not leave!

“Lister”: “Jaelem” says (B. 3/9/’25) tliat
pulsing the heart is the latest idea in trying to
resuscitate a patient who has collapsed dur-
ing an operation. Medical journals for the
past few years have been full of reports of
cases in which, after trying artificial respira-
tion and injections of the usual stimulants
(strychnine, pituitrin, etc.), the heart has been
directly massaged unavailingly—if stoppage of
respiration and of the heart-beat are any cri-
teria. In such cases an injection of adrena-
lin direct into the heart muscle has caused
the apparently dead to revive. In one ease
the injection was not given for 10 minutes
after the heart had stopped, but following it
the heart at once began to beat. Later on
respiration returned and the patient re-
covered completely. This injection has
already been successfully used in Australia.
It is very easy to give speedily, as it merely
involves pushing a long needle through the
right spot in the chest wall. This method is
now being used in most important clinics
abroad in preference to all other means. One
should mention, however, that it is only
of use in cases of shock; it is of no avail
in a death from natural causes.
“Sixenate”: Complaints are frequent that
the lunacy laws make it too easy for the evil-
intentioned to get troublesome but doubtfully
insane people under lock and key; and per-
haps they do. At any rate, consider the
case of a Melbourne citizen. After putting
up with a good deal he rang up the two
doctors necessary to certify that any person
is insane. They arrived —and promptly cer-
tified that he was insane. There may have
been some excuse for them, too; for while
he was changing his clothes his wife had
surreptitiously entered and removed his last
pair of undamaged pants (she had previously
unpicked the stitches in all the others), and
his language reflected the stress that had
been laid upon his soul. At the asylum, how-
ever, his wife announced that a man w T ho
asserted that lie was an oyster was her soul-
NO OPTION.
THE KITTEN: “The man I marry must be
quite fearless.”
THE CAT: “He will be!”
mate because she was a shell; and that
finally decided the doctors to put the woman
in and liberate the man. This man, half-
ruined in pocket, and nearly worried into his
grave, has no delusions about the “ease"
with which the lunacy laws may be invoked.

THE UNCHANGING HUNTRESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Leeturing on ‘The Nile, its Temples and Tombs,’
Principal Thatcher, of Camden College, Sydney,
showed that the devices and artifices in woman’s
dress and adornment were much the same 4000 years
ago as to-day.”
They’d the same sort of springe
For the amorous beau
In the way of a fringe
On the forehead cut low ;
They had necklaces rare
And glittering rings, ,
And bangles to wear,
And similar things.
The wiles that inflame
The heart of the knut,
The points of the game
Were exactly the same
At the court o’ King Tut.
They swam into view
in their powder and paint—
Did you think they were new,
These “aids” ? Well, they ain't!
They'd the whole box of tricks,
Excepting the “fag,”
That Gwendoline sticks ,
In her vanity bag.
Cosmetics and scent
The senses to glut—
Girls knew what they meant
For conquest who went
To the court o’ King Tut.
They were possibly swart,
Sans roses-and-milk
Complexions to sport,
But their skins were as silk ;
And in silken attire
They floated so smooth
Men’s passions to fire
Or longings to soothe.
The world moves, you say.
U ndoubtedly—but
Woman captured her prey
In the very same way
As she snares it to-day,
At the court o' King Tut.

THE WISE THAT WON AT WEMBLEY,

“Flicker”: “Offsider” asks if a marriage
is legal without the production of a wedding-
ring at the psychological moment (B.
10/9/’25). He can rest assured that the
ring is not necessary to the ceremony, and
quite without significance in the contract.
In none of the many Marriage Acts is any
reference whatever made to the ring. Yet
the old illusion dies hard. There was a case
in England in, I think, 1823, where a bride
discovered that the wedding-ring was brass
and not gold. She immediately left her hus-
band, and in the firm belief that there had
been no valid marriage proceeded to wed
again. The Law listened coldly to her ex-
planation, and convicted her of bigamy,
though she received a pardon later.
* * * *
“Oxmead”: The keen desire of a dying
man to have some cherished possession
buried with him (B. 17/9/’25) crops up in
queer places and breasts that would hardly
be regarded as sentimental. Some 17 years
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
“So that's Hilda Highlights! I wouldn't have known her from

ago a particularly cold-blooded murderer was
sentenced to death at Perth. His methods
had been apparently modelled upon those of
the notorious Butler; he had decoyed his
victim into the bush under the guise of mate-
ship in a prospecting expedition, and there
were the strongest grounds for believing
that the crime for which he suffered was only
one of several such atrocities. This blood-
stained criminal’s last request to the prison
authorities was that his pipe, a well-seasoned
briar which had supplied him with most of
his solace during the closing weeks of life,
should be interred with him. It was.
* * * *
“S.T.S.” : How is this for a grim coinci-
dence? In my (Adelaide) daily paper of
15/9/’25, on the weekly motor-cycling page,
appears by chance a trade puff for a par-
ticular make of machine, telling chattily
how a Melbourne man lately, at 70, bought
a new So-and-So, and the scornful answer
he gave when a doctor said that if he didn’t
give up his motor-bike he would soon be in
an invalid’s chair. On the next page, in
the ordinary telegrams, was a brief par, re-
cording that yesterday the same veteran was
thrown from a newly-purchased motor-cycle
on the Geelong-road, and died of a fractured
skull.
“Ces”: My entry for the busy bridegroom
stakes is the Digger settler I met a few
months ago in the Western district of Vic-
toria. He was coming off his block attired
with some care, except for a pair of muddy
blucher boots. “Hullo, Dig.,” I greeted,
“wliere-to, all dressed up so early?” He
grinned back. “I’m getting married to-day.
Just goin’ over to help Bill milk his cows
first. Bill’s my best man.”
“The Colonel”: “X.N.0.” (B. 10/9/’25)
may be right when he says that the hauling
down of the white ensign at sunset is all a
matter of economy; but what of the dislodg-
ing of the small red pennant that floats by
day in front of a brigadier’s tent? This is
always hauled down at “Retreat” and a red
lantern substituted. The red lantern, of
course, is to enable people to find brigade
headquarters by night (other headquarters,
field ambulances, etc., have different illumi-
nated signs) ; but the rite of removing the
flag and substituting the nightlight is often
performed with solemn ceremony. First
the guard turns out, and everyone within
sight stands at attention while the buglers
sound “Retreat”; then as the last note dies
away down flutters the pennant, and up
goes the lantern. I had the impression that
the turning-out of the guard was a sort of
salute to departing Sol, a relic of pagan sun-
worship, but possibly the parade is merely
to see that the guard is “all present and
correct.”
* * * *
“M.H.” : Unlike some contributors, I never
saw a marriage solemnised across a creek or
in the shadow of
the gallows, but I
have a poignant
memory of one
which I attended
not long ago. It
was celebrated in
a private house in
a little N.S.W.
country town
whither the bride,
who suffered from
a bad heart and
had the unhealthy
flush of one not
long for this world,
had come to seek a
little strength in
pleasant sur-
roundings. During
the ceremony she
remained seated in
her chair, with a
wreath and veil
and all the other
regalia to show
that she clung fast
to the old dreams
of girlhood. At
times her voice
faltered, and once
she had to pause
while spirits were
brought to her.
When it was over T,
(be “best, man."
followed the minis-
ter on to the side
verandah. He was
shaking his head
sadly. “It's a great
pity,” he said —
"only a month or
two, and the poor
girl wall leave us.”
After many months
multiplied by two
the bride is better
than she has been
for years. But the
sympathetic parson
was killed in a
level-crossing smash
soou after the cere-
mony.
“Lex'’: Now that spring lias come the Vir-
ginia creeper will soon be thinking of put-
ting on its green coat and brightening up
the dull brick walls. Thus the little legal
romance set out in the case of Simpson v.
Weber, recently before an English Court, is
seasonable. Weber had the good luck to own
two adjoining houses, and with a view to
decorative purposes set going a Virginia
creeper, which climbed up the wall of one
of the twain, and in the days of autumn
made it more than passing beautiful. In
winter it did not serve any aesthetic or utili-
tarian purpose. It came about that \> eber
sold one of the houses—the one bearing the
creeper—to Simpson, but the roots of the
vine remained in the vendor s land.. V\ hen
winter came the purchaser derived neither de-
light nor comfort from the climber. He
vowed that it made his wall wet, and set
AND NOW YOU KNOW.
“Am I the only hoy who ever kissed you?”
“Why do men always ask that silly question? ”
about getting rid of it. With this end in
view he went to the Court for an injunction
against Weber, asking that he be restrained
from allowing the offensive vine—which had
the impertinence to drop its dead leaves into
Simpson’s gutters—to climb up and dampen
the wall. Weber said in reply that he had
acquired an easement in the matter—that
is, a right to climb his vine on Simpson’s
wall by virtue of prescription or custom.
He’d been doing it for a long time, and no
one had objected. In the end the Court
gravely delivered judgment. Said the Court,
in effect, “Weber has an easement. The
vine is an old one, and has gladdened and
dampened the wmll for many years, and no
man said aught against it. But the gutter
is the gutter of Simpson, and the right to
have it clear of leaves is in him. The vine
may, therefore, climb, but if it drops its
leaves in Simpson’s gutter it does so at its
peril.” And so the matter ended on the due
payment of costs. Whereupon Weber re-
turned home to admonish the vine.
“Clerk”: A week or so back a new motor-
car disappeared from a Sydney street, and
the agents for that make sought to turn the
incident to account by inserting an ad. in
the dailies congratulating the thief on “pick-
ing the best of the bunch.” The firm has
since received a letter from “William Sikes”
assuring it that “the car is giving every satis-
faction. My wife is pleased with it also,
and wants one for herself, so if you would
kindly leave your showroom unlocked for a
night or two I will call and make a selec-
tion, sometime between midnight and 3 p.m.
(union hours). With regard to your illus-
trations in the advertisement, permit me to
point out that the best burglars nowadays
have discarded the scarf and wear semi-soft
collars and Oxford bags.”

“Uramao": The prophet Ratana’s new
church, like his new banking system, is exer-
cising the minds of the established orders
which hitherto had some sway among Maoris.
It has, indeed, so stirred the C. of E. that three
North Island bishops are talking of excom-
municating those black brothers who sign
the covenant. But. Ratana’s fold is all-
embracing. Pakehas. Chinese and Hindus
have all been admitted to membership by the
miracle man. Some 50 “ministers” have
been gazetted, but liturgical smoothness is
yet to be attained. The other day an apostle
was performing the burial service over a
defunct Ratanite when his memory failed
him. He made a beeline home for the book
of the words; and the mourners thought the
thing was over and departed. But, hurrying
back, he rounded up the straying sheep and
finished the business properly.
“Percy Pawnticket": We were working
back when Blonk staggered info the office
and flopped on to a chair. Banger, who had
been doing Blonk’s work, called him a dirty
dog, and Blonk said lie had probably become
one because they led him such a dog’s life.
Then he barked at us, and, finding that it
caused some amusement, he went down on all
fours and repeated the performance. After
that he left the oflice and barked his way
to the lift. We pursued him, and learnt
from a grinning liftman that he had in-
sisted on travelling down on all fours, and
might now be found in front of the build-
ing barking at the traffic. We arrived just
in time to save him from an encounter with
a black retriever which had approached with
growls and bristling hair to investigate some-
thing new in Towserdom, and we compelled
him to stand upright. But I don’t think
we would have got Blonk home for hours it
the dog-collecting van had not come along
just then and agreed, for a consideration, to
do • the job, Blonk having premised that
this was the only vehicle he would con-
sent to travel in. To-day, sober and in his
right mind, Blonk told us with bitterness how
some soulless blanks had got him drunk and
thought it a joke to send him home in the
dog-conveyance. We expressed sympathy
and let it go at that.
* * * *
“Quero”: A bride who bolted in a very old
Australian country town years ago proved
that it is not only in novels that the beauti-
ful daughter is handed to the wrong bride-
groom in payment for her father’s follies.
This girl’s father had got into financial
trouble through a not too creditable under-
taking, and his chief creditor was a bachelor,
well-off and elderly, who offered to marry the
girl and square the debt. The girl, who was
interested in a young engineer she had
known all her life, indignantly refused, but
family pressure was strong enough to send
her to the church, and as she signed the
register the bridegroom handed a receipt to
his father-in-law. Arrived back home the
bride w'alked through the house, without
hesitating went straight through the back
door and joined the engineer in the lane be-
hind the house, and together they went off.
Xo amount of persuasion could induce her to
return; she maintained she had completely
fulfilled her part of the bargain. Nobody
seemed to know' what to do about the matter,
the bridegroom shunned divorce and pub-
licity. and finally her family had to accept
flic situation and make the best of it. And
her numerous children still arise and call
her memory blessed.
BALLADE OF SIGNS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Signs are not wanting that summer is near.”
Ask not the lisping maid or beau
If Chloris wakens in the land.
It’s not so easy, friends, to know,
Diverted by another’s hand
Within the precincts of the band,
If anything is really near.
But here’s a sign to understand:
To-day I had a golden beer.
The poet lays his pencil low,
And folds his sonnet, duly scanned
To tell in fourteen lines or so
How summer sang a-down the strand
With winds that kissed his cheek and fanned
The wart upon his other ear.
All tosh, my friends! Summer’s not spanned
By any measure but a beer.
The fashion leader twirls his mo,
And eyes the corsets on their stand;
Decrees the silhouette shall go
That long has held the maidens canned,
And flattened ribs and hips expand
And billows ripple fore and rear—
A greater far than he has planned
To herald summer with a beer.
Envoy.
Ho, comrades of the flagons, ho!
Chloris returns, and we may steer
Where Hebe’s ready with a flow
Of summer-telling golden beer.

THE LINGUIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“From the beginning the marriage was unhappv.
When she asked for money lie would swear at her in
Yiddish, Polish, Russian and English.”
Though some may pour on “empty words” their
scorn,
Far more than sticks and stones they've power to
hurt you;
And he whose thoughts in many tongues are borne
(If you're a lady jealous of your virtue)
Gives harder knocks with phrases, say, in Latin
Than English words could give, though not of satin.
He swore at, her—a. brute uncouth and cruel,
He told her what he thought she was. .tans feeling ;
In Buss and Polish he prepared her gruel,
And gave her Yiddish till her brain was reeling;
It was all Greek to her, but, as a rule,
What’s Greek to you kicks harder than a mule.
Perhaps he said “Thou Przemysl!” What a pity
She didn’t know he merely named a city !

for gold blazed many tracks through the
deadly swamps and over the rugged and
scrub-covered mountains of the mysterious
island. A fearless searcher, in the 20-odd
years that elapsed between his discovery of
the rich goldfield of the Yodda Valley and
the patchy field at the head of the Lakekamu
River he opened up numerous rich gold-
bearing creeks and river fiats in the hitherto
unknown hinterland. With a well-filled
shammy of hard-won wealth, he several times
sot past the temptations of Samarai, and
reached southern civilisation with the avowed
intention of never returning. But always
the call became too insistent, and he would
hurry back to obtain “boys” and supplies for
another trek into the wilds. At Samarai,
where he had spent much of his early-day
wealth, the big and generous-hearted miner
went west.
The third Catholic bishop of Armi-
dale (N.S.W), Patrick Joseph O’Con-
nor, with the aid of half a dozen
bishops, four archbishops and half a
hundred priests, has just celebrated his
clerical jubilee. When Father O’Connor,
at the age of 28, left the Old Sod for his new
parish in the Armidale diocese, he found
the latter, under its first bishop, a slice of
earth 700 miles long by 400 miles wide, with
only three priests, 12 chapels—eight of them
weatherboard—-no bishop’s house, school or
presbytery. To-day, besides the £30,000
cathedral, there are 68 churches, 33 priests,
a couple of hundred nuns, seven teaching
brothers, 32 schools and an orphanage. Dur-
ing his peridd of bishing, Dr. O’Connor lias
spent £250,000 on buildings: His people are
so pleased about it that they have given the
“Bush Bishop” a motor-car and £2OOO to
spend on petrol.

persing the good
money they caught
for him.

Old mining identities will spare a sigli for
Reginald Murray, ex-Vic. Government Geo-
logist, who has laid down life's burden in a
private hospital at Caulfield. In an official
bulletin published 15 years ago the Mines
Department declared that few, if any, of the
other officials of the geological branch had
undergone the privations and hardships to
which Murray was exposed in the early days
of geological survey. When he resigned his
job iii 1897 several of his friends thought
that he had made a mistake, and they were
right. The fortune he looked for in private
practice did not materialise, and for the last
20 years of his life lie vegetated at Willow-
grove, Gippsland, working a small auriferous
claim. He was within five months of four-
score.
William Copley, a politician almost for-
gotten by this generation, died at Adel-
aide the other day. In 1884, when president
of S.A. Farmers’ Association, he was elected,
along with Ebby Ward, for the then immense
western district of Frome, and later he was
in the Leg. Council. The only survivors
of his Assembly colleagues of 18S4 are
Lance Stirling, Symon. Cockburn (in Eng-
land), Castinc and E. W. Hawker, and only
the first-named, r.ow President of the Coun-
cil, is still in politics. Copley was Minister
for Lands and Education under Playford,
and Chief Secretary under John Downer.
He piloted through the Council the measure
which gave the State free education, and he
visited M.L. to borrow the principle of
advances-for-homesteads. His only sensa-
tional exploit was going across from Parlia-
ment House to Government House one day
during the Boer War and pulling down the
South Aus. flag, on the plea that the Union
Jack ought rightly to be flying there.
The death of Mrs. Martha Forrester, of
Balmain (Sydney), severs the partnership
of probably the most ancient couple in Aus-
tralia ; she was reputed to be 109 years and
nine months old, and her husband, Frank
Forrester, is 98. He was her third husband,
the marriage taking place over 50 years ago.
Mrs. Forrester came of a long-lived family,
her brother, Captain Kavanagh, having lived
to be 105. Incidentally, the. lady, then a young
woman of 21, arrived in Melbourne when the
piles were being driven for its first struc-
tures ; and she never in her long life found
it necessary to wear spectacles.
The East-West railway now runs where
Arthur Gregory Mason, who died the other
day in Perth Hospital, nearly left his bones
30 years ago. The railway was projected
some years before Federation came along,
and it was in 1896 that Mason, who had
made a reputation as a surveyor and ex-
plorer, reported to the W.A. Government
wpon the route by which the line could be
hud at the least expense. The party of
three had a rough time of it: blacks stole
their camels 5 one man perished from thirst;
food became so scarce that a dog was eaten;
and the survivors tramped 160 miles in six
days, licking the morning dew off the herbage,
till they reached a small waterhole. But
Mason Jived to do his bit in the war, although
past military age—he was 58 at his death.
Just dead John Egan was the last
9,*- the “jobbers” registered by Melbourne
htock Exchange. His connection dated back
t° 1888. He was a legal manager and
auditor, and was closely associated with
Woods Point and Gaffney’s Creek mines,
particularly the New Dempsey.
The- crash of Hoyt’s verandah under the
weight of the people who were watching the
march of the American sailors through Mel-
bourne has resulted in one death —Vera
1 earce, after lingering from July 24 to Sep-
tember 16, died from her injuries. Four days
earlier the last of the other injured people
was discharged from hospital. ‘ The small
casualty roll is much more amazing than
the accident; the roof that fell was covered
by people, and the pavement underneath was
packed with more. But the structure came
down slowly, enabling scores of people to
get out of the danger zone.
Hr. Frank Hay, Inspector-General of
Maori land s mental hospitals, who married
Mary Stuart. Seddon, daughter of Primin-
ister Dick, died, like his father-in-law, at
sea. He was returning from a health-
vecruiting trip to the Cold Land when he
passed over on the Ruahine on the eve of
her arrival in Wellington Harbor.
Elizabeth Lamb Plunkett, widow of G. D
E. Plunkett, has died at Millicent (S.A.),
a Sed BL\ She was the eldest daughter of
the late George Gladstone, of Penola, who
was a first cousin of 'Vyilliam Ewart Glad-
stone. Adam Lindsay Gordon was a fre-
quent visitor at the Penola home of the Glad-
stones, and Mrs. Plunkett numbered among
her treasures an old-fashioned writing desk
that belonged to the poet.
R. J. Fletcher, of Geelong, chemical manu-
facturer, was one of the big men behind the
scenes in Australia in 1914-15. When Aus-
tralia discovered that all its dyes, its tar-
founded disinfectants and many of its most-
yvanted chemicals had come from Germany,
it sent out a yell for help. Fletcher, not
a very great manufacturer, but a keen chemi-
cal student and investigator, heard the call,
burnt much midnight kerosene and produced
chemical copies of the goods required. The
distracted Defence Department wept on his
neck, and told him to go on. He was too
old for the war, and he had no brood of
sorm to send, so he got the idea that liis
• bit was to supply his country’s wants at
cost, plus expenses. For months hospitals
ana clothing factories were kept going with
their chemical needs at rates far below what
the manufacturer could have obtained in the
starved open market. He kept his factory go-
mg for the duration, and when peace arrived
found himself with several hundred pounds’
worth of special machinery which promptly
became junk. No thanks came Fletcher’s
way ; no offer of reimbursement of his special
expenses; only a demand to the last penny
of excess profit-tax on his increased war-
turnover.
The new President of the Labor party in
South Aus. is M. R. O’Halloran, State mem-
ber of the Assembly for Burra. He is a
good talker, and at the moment is Chairman
of the Railways Standing Committee. The
man he follows in the chair is Arthur
McArthur, who will very likely be the organ-
iser that the just-closed conference decided
was essential. This decision and a ukase
ordering the Gunn Government to bring in
a 44-hour week were the only outstanding
features of the conference.
Dr. Redwood, who journeyed from Maori-
land to help Bishop O’Connor, of Armidale
(N.S.W.), celebrate his golden jubilee, is in
the 52nd year of his episcopacy and the
87th of his life. His friendship with the
jubilarian began 40 years ago when they
took part in the first Plenary Synod of the
Australian Catholic Church. Francis Red-
wood easily remembers when the Ma State
hadn’t one of its present six bishoprics; also
how to play soothing themes on his precious
Strad. to seasick people journeying between
M.L. and N. S. Wales.

and billiards. He holds a pen between his
two stumps and scribbles off a letter without
effort, his writing being extremely neat and
legible. He captains the departmental
cricket team (incidentally, he heads both
batting and bowling averages), holding
the bat as he does a pen. In bowling he
grips the ball in the crook of his right elbow
and sends down an over-arm toss just as an
able-bodied trundler does. He has also in-
dulged in football, and as an umpire con-
trolled ordinary matches and semi-finals in
the Junior League a few years back. In
addition, he is Mordialloc’s champion bil-
liardist. He uses a small rest of his own
construction for his cue, and, although he has
scant time for practice, succeeded in notch-
ing an 87 break in a recent tournament.

slip in his statement that the Adelaide
suburb of Thebarton was named after
Colonel Light’s English birthplace (B.
3/9/’25). Light was born at the isle of Pulo
Penang, better known as Prince of Wales
Island. His father, Francis Light, an
eighteenth-century Empire-builder, was the
first Governor of the island; his mother,
according to some writers, was a daughter
of the King of Quedah ; others have it that
she was Martina Bozella, a Portuguese lady
of Siam. In 1792 young Light, then six
years old, was entrusted to the care of his
father’s friends, Mr. and Mrs. Doughty, of
Thebarton Hall, Suffolk; it was after his
guardian’s residence that Light, when Sur-
veyor-General of S. Aus. in 1836, named his
colonial home.

family fortunes was Daniel Cooper, who was

IF ONLY
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Whenever I wander,
Green trees for my neighbors
’Tis lightly I ponder
On life and its labors;
For men live a little,
Then perish forever,
And death puts an end
To the finest endeavor.
The flowers know not hurry,
Their honey-smells giving,
Tile trees neither worry
Nor work for a living.
They’re happy. I take it,
Their lives lit and sunny,
Not caring a toss
Of their petals for money.
’Twist morrow and morrow
And blooming and dying,
X'o sadness, no sorrow,
Xo sickness, no sighing
They have for their portion ;
But c easeless enjoyment—
That much and no more—
Seems their only employment, *
As, dreaming, I idle
’Xeath fronds interlacing,
A steed without bridle.
My fancy goes pacing
Wherever it listeth,
And, in the gold weather,
Dark care lies as light
On my heart as a feather.
Yet man is in bondage
To trouble and weeping,
And ever through frondage
And leafage comes creeping
Some serpent of Eden;
Wherefore to my sorrow
At times, serpent-wise,
Comes the thought of the morrow.
For candlestick maker
And bagman and brewer,
And butcher and baker
And dreamer and doer,
Unlike the green monarchs
Or blossoms we cherish,
Must do a hand’s turn
For their stomachs... .or perish.
’Twero pleasant to wander,
Green trees for one’s neighbors,
And lightly to ponder
On life and its labors—
Xo grime of the city
The forest air fouling—
If only the wolf
At the door were not howling.

“Jacaranda": If one must use an inter-
preter it is just as well to know \yhat lie is saying—
or perhaps it isn’t. The head serang of a mission
society had decided to inspect the fields of labor for
himself. Arriving at one of the principal stations
in a heathen land he was much gratified at the large
crowd of converts that had been mustered to greet
him. Arrayed in white robes, they alt gathered into
the church where the great man was to address
them, and a native teacher who savvied both lan-
guages stood ready to translate the English words
into the dialect of the converts. The visitor led
off with an expression of the great pleasure it gave
him to see so many assembled to greet him, adding
that his “heart was wanned by the sight.” Here
he paused for the interpreter to get in a sentence.
The latter paused, and then suddenly decided to
chance it in pidgin English; and an extra-prim and
proper divine was edified to hear “That big-fella
master he so glad to see all boys and all Marys that
belly belong him it hot too much; it hot as
Hell.”
“Feng-Shui”: Has Australia any public
memorials to wild animals ? There is one alongside
the railway line at Telok Anson, in the Federated
Malay States. The inscription reads: “There is
buried here a wild elephant who, in defence of his
herd, charged and derailed a train on the 17th day
of September, 1894.”
* * * *
“Nor’-West”: I come in on the side of
“Nakh.” “Sheepskin,” in his cocksure statement
<B. 20/8/’25), says there is no instances of eels being
caught in western N.S.W. waters. He is hopelessly
mistaken. In September, 1909, I and a mate were
camped on the Gwydir River four miles from Graves-
end village, where we caught a silver-eel in a set
night-line baited with rabbit. It was 3ft. Sin. long
and weighed 3 jib. Also two large eels have been
caught in the Severn River, about 10 miles from
Emmaville, on Ranger’s Valley station. One of
them weighed 191 b. I have also been assured that
two eels have been caught in the Namoi River, but
I cannot verify this. The silver-eel caught at
Gravesend was fully 150 miles from eastern water.
“Kemuriti”: It was while the Aussies and
Maorilanders were wirelessly intercepting Jacko Turk’s
coded information in ’l7 at Bagdad that I became
acquainted with Bill the Lizard. We were billeted
in an aristocratic Arab dwelling, the operators’.room
being on the ground floor. One afternoon I noticed
Bill sally from a crack in the back wall, a few
feet above me, and remain
motionless for half an hour.
Then a fly happened along,
and he flicked his prey
into inner darkness. Bill’s
visits always occurred
about the same time, and
I conceived the idea of
contributing to his menu.
Before his dinner hour I
placed on a ledge, about
2ft. above the operating
table, a dead fly. He soon
noticed it and after two
or three cautious sprinvs
descended and devoured it.
He became bolder, and m
less than a fortnight, on
creeping from his crevice,
came straight down to his
meal. He got to know
me, I’m sure, for after
taking one carcase he would
retreat a little and watch
for another. Five was his
limit. If anything delayed
me beyond his usual hour,
I always found him wait-
ing. Bill convinced me
that lizards not only can,
and do, reason, but have a
lingo of their own. Also
they are capable of gener-
ous feelings. On one occa-
sion I placed a dozen flies
on the ledge. Having
accounted for five, he dis-
appeared, soon to make
another appearance. This
time he was accompanied
by a cobber, smaller than
himself, to whom I had
not previously been intro-
duced. I presume it was
his wife or an offspring.
In short, timid spurts he
got her to follow him to
the mess-table, and “stood
by” while she made a gap
in my line of flies. After
this they often came out together, though not always.
* * * *
"Gouger" : The abo. is an incomprehen-
sible creature. Whilst physically on this sphere, he
is most of the time mentally in a spirit-world. That
is why a nigger makes a present of anything he has
constructed to a trusted friend only, and even then
he must be certain that he will receive a present in
return. This is because any article he has often
handled carries with it some part of his personality.
Days-old tracks of a man can bo followed by a dog,
even though such tracks are invisible to the eye.
The explanation is that some clinging “scent” of
the man lingers where his feet have trod. That
“s(|ent” is part of his personality, and is discernible
to the dog. So also any article a man bandies may
be said to carry with it. a part of the owner’s per-
sonality. Should, therefore, an enemy obtain pos-
session of a man's belongings, or of anything he
once owned, bis enemy would have in his keeping
part of that man’s personality, and with the aid of
bad spirits would be able to work harm on the owner.
Therefore, the wild nigger, on shifting camp, is
scrupulously careful to leave no trace of stray bits
of belongings (t.e., of himself) lying about. Should
even wisps of bis hair get into the possession of an
enemy, a competent witch-doctor may soon be play-

MR. MCNAB : “A ye, I feel it verra hard when I've got to buy a

ing pranks with him. This personality idea is, 1
believe, at the root of the niggers’ marriage system.
A common contract of marriage is, providing the
totem relationship is correct and the woman has
not been given otherwise in babyhood, for two men
to exchange sisters. Thus each man gives himself
into the power of the other, and by doing so each
is safe. For a man to give his sister in marriage
means that he is handing over part of his personality,
the bride being such a close relation. He must,
therefore, have part of the other man’s personality
in exchange. If he has no sister, then some prized
weapon of his will do. So when families meet and
exchange women, their personalities are bound to-
gether in friendship for all time. If an avenging
party is hard on the heels of a frightened tribe, then,
as a last resource, the hunted people send some of
their women to “make peace” with the hunters, the
idea being that women are possessed of more spirit-
life than men, and thus better able to pacify angry
passions.
“Dawson” : , Dr. Herbert Basedow in bis
book, “The Australian Aboriginal,” published this
year, mentions a stone-axe from King Sound, in
North-West Australia, 3Hn. by 2jin., weighing six
ounces. Out here, on the Dawson River, near Tarooin
(Q.), I have secured specimens even smaller—2fin.
long—and others barely 3in. They are of exquisite
workmanship, and are of a dark green stone not
unlike serpentine.
“Pick”: If “The Jumper” (B. 3/9/’25)
wants to carp about color in contradicting my state-
ment re white foals, let me placate him by agreeing
that rarely, if ever, are foals born white. They are
foals, though, until they become colts or fillies, and
before then their early slate, roan or chestnut has
in many cases changed to whitish, creamy or grey.
Now, “The Jumper” talks of while horses. But has
he or any other Abo. ever seen a really white horse?
1 haven’t, though 1 have seen hundreds that were
called white.
“Bill R.”: The argument of "X2X” (B.
3/9/’2o), that electricity disseminated over a wide area
would not concentrate again sufficiently to have much
of a kick at any particular place, does not seem right
to me. At Enfield (N.S.W.), during a last-winter
storm, a fallen pole immersed its electric wires in
one end of a flooded dam. In another part a wire
fence entered the water. A cow that touched the
wires bellowed frantically, and when her wondering
owner, seeking a cause for the animal’s distress,
also touched the fence, he received a' severe shock.
Both had to be forcibly rescued by a man who under-
stood the situation. A leakage from the power plant
of a. Sydney timber-mill spread by way of a wet
floor to the iron rollers of the saw-bench. When
a wet log was placed upon the bench just afterwards,
the sawyer who endeavored to handle it was nearly
electrocuted.
“Atherton”: Cudgerie is a tall, smooth-
barked Queensland tree which may be found useful for
medicinal purposes. The flowers are very fragrant,
often bunching in threes, the centre one being
female. The fruit is a black nut. Its shell con-
tains a dye which is soluble in soda, but not in
e t h er, a 1-c oh o 1 or
water. The kernel con-
tains 65 p.c. of oil,
similar to laurel oil,
and has a narcotic
smell. The wood is
dark grey in color, its
grain close. It is
light and soft, and has
been successfully used
for carriage- and fur-
niture-building and
lining-boards. The
Queensland red-iroribark
is a great tree of which
unknown millions of
feet have been sent up
in smoke. It is one
of the best all-round
engineering timbers the
Commonwealth grows,
and has been used for
almost every purpose
where tough, durable
wood is required. The
strongest gun-carriage
wheels known are made
with spokes of this
timber. A little-known
Queensland tree is the
apunyah, growing
freely in the inland
North. It is accus-
tomed to a hot cli-
mate and seldom grows
over 30ft. high. The
wood is tough and
has answered well to
the hard work put
upon it by the out-
backer. A wonderful
tree is the N.Q. walnut,
absolutely equal, if not
superior, to the Ameri-
can. It grows well
over 100 feet high.
The w'ood is chocolace
colored, similar to the
English timber, is of
first-class grain, and
dresses well. Also
it takes a good polish,
figures excellently, and
seasons very rapidly.
It possesses great
strength. Queensland grows some 600 distinct kinds
of timber, many of them equalling the best in the
world. There are vast areas of virgin scrubs and
forests in the tropical North. Some day they will
be active with the life of big lumber camps.

“Pat Bushie”: “Coolabah” cannot claim a
record for the four foxes his friend got by trailing
a roast rabbit and laying poison baits. A friend
and I once dragged a trail over his selection near
the Warrumbungle Range (N.S.W.), keeping within
100 yards of the bore-drain. The trail was made
with four half-roasted rabbits, dragged behind a
sulky, and strychnine baits were buried at intervals

No car at or near the price rivals the Hudson Coach
in actual proof of value —which is SALES
cvbfg
The Hudson Super-Six has led fine car sales for more than
10 years, simply because it has constantly led in real auto-
mobile value.
Today it offers the greatest price advantage and finest
quality in Hudson history. Never was this supremacy of
value so outstanding. And the greatest Hudson sales on
record show how full is public appreciation of the facts.
Proof of Greatest Value—Greatest SALES
It is only as you find the real comparisons for Hudson qualities
among the costliest cars that the enormous difference in price is so
astonishing. Everywhere it is called “The Worlds Greatest Buy.**
That is not simply a new attainment. It is acknowledgment of ten
years* refinement of a great car around the famous patented Super-
Six principle. No motor design, however costly, has been found to
displace this long-time leadership of the exclusive Super-Six.
It is not only speed, power and brilliancy
of performance that have won such wide
preference for Hudson. To hundreds of
thousands of owners Hudson value also
means the most economical service in oper-
ation and maintenance as well as the
finest in quality within hundreds of dollars
of its price.

“Keith K.” - The abo. is very short of
musical instruments. In N.Q. I have seen him tapping
two boomerangs together to keep th» rhythm during
a corroboree, and in W.A. he uses a short species
of club, which he strikes on the ground for the
same purpose. In N.T. a drone pipe about 4ft. long
is used. I have one in my collection, but so far

the Council let me know if the tone is produced by

“Jimmy Possum”: “Bunya” says (B.
13/8/’25) every bushman knows that in dry times
native-bears work gradually towards water. Not
always. In Bananaland, in the great parch of 1902,
when whole ridges of trees died outright, I saw
numbers of the grunters contentedly drowsing in
mountainous country miles away from water. They
appeared to be none the worse for the severe con-
ditions, although the leaves of the trees were becoming
scanty and sapless. If Stumpy makes for the creeks
when things begin to get dry, it is because the feed
is greener there, and not because he needs a drink.
The nightly dews provide all the drink a bear re-
quires. The rubber-noses die early in captivity
through digestive troubles, brought about by unsuitable
feeding and being deprived of their natural medicine.
Confined bears will drink readily and eat sweet-
meats wholesale.

“Morob” : The rufous-headed native is not
unknown in New Guinea (B. 13/8/’25), though not
common. His hair is not the bright red of the
Scandinavian and other Nordic peoples, but rather
the dull reddish-brown sometimes seen in red-haired
folk from the countries of Central Europe. One
interesting feature of such occurrence in N.G. and
the Pacific Islands is that in some cases it is the
hair of the head only which is of the unusual color,
the pubic hair and that in the axilla being of the
customary tint. Although rusty hair seems to occur
amongst practically all the races of the world—
with the exception of the Chinese and Japanese—it
is not likely, from a biological viewpoint, that it is
a perfectly natural thing in native races. Probably
the phenomenon is just as much a physiological
.abnormality as the occurrence of the albino amongst
the natives of N.G., and the basic cause of both
somewhat similar, either the absence or the abnormal
presence in the tissue-cells of natural pigments.

“Wirenu”: Some time ago I was the guest
of a well-to-do Maori. My bedroom window over-
looked the bay, and on two consecutive moonlight
nights I saw what I took to be a sailing-vessel enter ;
but, strange to say, when the image became lost to
view behind some small islands a quarter of a
mile off shore, it did not emerge again and I saw no
more of it. I men-
tioned the matter to
my Maori host. He
did not seem a bit sur-
prised. It was, he said,
a “spirit vessel” and
had been seen by
several people. His
grandfather was tn
Englishman, one of die
old whalers who re-
sided in the Sounds
before colonisation
started, and had seen
this vessel about SO
years ago. It then
lowered a boat, and
the men who got into
it were dressed like
old-time soldiers and
sailors. He went to
meet them at the land-
ing jetty, and to his
surprise both boat and
vessel had vanished.
He said it was an old-
fashioned vessel of the
schooner type. My
host told me that the
Maoris had a tradi-
tion that a long time
ago a vessel had landed
there and had been
captured. This, he
thought, related to the
massacre of a boat’s
crew belonging to
Captain Furneaux’s
ship Adventure (Cook’s
second voyage), but it
might possibly have
referred to some other.
Various successful in-
vasions by North
Island Maoris had
wiped out the original
inhabitants before
colonisation started,
and it was hard now
to get any authentic
account of traditions
relating to Captain
Cook’s many visits.
The image I saw was
too indistinct to iden-
tify. I had not been told of the “spirit vessel”
till I had seen the phantom twice.

“Runa”: An unusual visitox* to southern
waters was caught lately at Nelson (M.L.) when a
fisherman’s take included a ribbon-fish 14ft. long.
It is bright silver in color, and flaunts a scarlet crest
two feet high. It is the fourth specimen caught in
M.L. waters, and goes, like the rest, into a museum.
TELLING HOME SECRETS.
TEACHER ( seeking to point out the wickedness of stealing ): "Now, if I were to put my
hand in someone's pocket and take out the money in it, what would I he?"
TOMMY: “ Please, Miss, you’d he his wife.”
“Citrus”: I reside in a citrus district and
eat freely of oranges and use lemon drinks. Some
say that both fruits are good for persons suffer-
ing from rheumatism, whilst others say to the
contrary. 1 would like to have the practical opinion
of some people who know from experience whether
the use of such fruit is beneficial or not in this
painful complaint.
* * * *
“Curlew”: I can corroborate what “Tain-
ornie” (B. 27/S/’25) says about horses and cattle
being trained to go as long as camels without water,
but only when not working. A period of 48 hours
is a long spell for the best-trained working horse to
go without a drink in hot weather. But I have
known horses at Prairie (C.Q.), in a drought, travel
30 miles back for grass, and come in only.once a
week, on an average, for a drink. As the only avail-
able water was a fenced-in bore, there could be no
doubt of the fact.
* * * *
“LD.” : “Has anyone seen a pure white
foal ?” asks an Abo. scribe. I own one, and it was
pure white when born. The mother, white also, was
the madrina, or bell-mare, of one of the tropillas
(group of horses) on Estancia Ranquillhuas, Argentina.
The Argentine considers it infra dig. to ride a mare,
and uses her for breeding only or as a bell-mare ;
that is, she leads her little mob of mules or geldings
when the owner is on a journey, or they run with
her when spelling. You can hear her trot-trot and
the tinkle of her little bell for miles in the rarefied
air of the Cordilleras. The Chilian, on the other
hand, likes riding a mare, and takes pride in her
appearance.
* * * *
“Jacky Roo” : After vainly trying for
eight years to slay eagle-hawks and crows during
lambing-time with guns and all kinds of poison, I
have at last been shown an effective method. Eyery
morning I set three or four rabbit-traps beside any
dead sheep or lambs there are in' the paddock. The
first day’s catch accounted for 14 crows, and I
have been getting them in twos and threes ever
since. Moreover, they are becoming scared, and are
gradually leaving the paddock. Incidentally, the first
day settled an old Abo. argument once and for all.
Of my 14 crows, six had white eyes and the remainder
brovvn eyes. So it seems that the alleged “raven” is
just as murderous as the crow propel*. A man at
Nevertire (N.S.W.) has gone still further, in the
trapping line, and has erected a netting enclosure
with a dozen or so rabbit-traps inside with dead
bunnies and sheep for bait. He has captured 96
hawks to date and an astonishing number of* crows.
* * * *
“Moe”: Although I have not had much
experience concerning the color of aboriginal child-
ren at birth (B. 13/8/’25), I can definitely say that
native babies in New Guinea and the Solomons are
frequently doughy-white when newly born, and that
this color sometimes lasts for nearly 24 hours. Occa-
sionally, however, a child is bom with a natural
coloring exactly the same as that of the race to
which it belongs, but cases in which this occurs
would not equal more than about one in a hundred.
The soundest theory is that most children are born
without the cellular skin pigmentations which cause
the natural skin color of the race to which they
belong. The elements or constituents of these pig-
ments are, however, present in the skin-cells, and the
subsequent coloration of the skin is brought about
by the actinic effect of light rays on these constituents.
This is borne out by the fact that, generally, children
born during the day assume their natural skin-
color within an hour or two, while those bom at
night do not change their tint until some time during
the following day.
* * * *
"Two Seas” : “Many people keep a tame
emu or two as a curiosity,” remarks “Wandi” (B.
20./8/’25). True, but their curiosity is soon satis-
fied. The emu himself has curiosity enough to
satisfy a whole family, and that is where the trouble
starts. The tame variety will stretch his long neck
through the kitchen window to see what is inside
the pie Mum has just taken out of the oven. He will
tidy up any small tools left lying around, and break
every bridle in the place by sidling up to horses
at the hitehing-rail to inquire what they are wait-
ing for. L owned one once, or, rather, the kids did,
and after I had tired of mending bridles and har-
ness crept out one evening when the youngsters
were abed and got that ridiculous bird in the neck
just as he was pushing a chook off her nest to
see what she was sitting on. A post-mortem exami-
nation explained the mysterious disappearance of a
nail-punch, a small pair of pliers, a file and a wire-
fencing key that had caused a feud between us and
a neighbor for three months.'

“Outback”: The Western portion of N. 8.
Wales has had more than its share of rain this year,
and a wonderful spring is being experienced. The
plains everywhere resemble huge colored carpets, here
a vivid green, there a yellow, and in other places
a pure white. The color scheme is due to the
growth of yellow and white “everlastings,” together
with a prolific crop of herbage. Even in the
timber there is evidence of springtime; the western
varieties of wattle are blooming profusely as if
to make up for time lost in unfavorable seasons.
Residents of the city picture the West as a gloomy
place where nothing grows. Actually, the West is
very beautiful when sufficient rain falls. The
brilliant Sturt-pea flourishes in sandy places, and,
although the scent is not very agreeable, there is
compensation in the rich coloring of the flower
attached to the creeper-like stem.
ON THE SPREE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I've lost my job again; and as 1 sit here, down and
out,
I see packed troopers leave the quay and hear the
last faint shout.
Now, wipe your eyes, you Melbourne girls; you
mothers, creep away—
We’ve got no time to think of you : we’re steaming
down the bay.
I see again the brown-skinned crowd, the Cairene
bazaars
Whose chattering merchants swindled us —the memory
still jars;
At dusk, the far-off caravan, black ’gainst the
smouldering sun :
The sea wind comes, the tattoo sounds, the soldier’s
day is done.
The shell-swept beach at Anzac, scarred cliffs and
scrub-clad hills ;
Half-naked, sinewy Diggers at the guns or hurling
Mills.
A roar, a crash, a shower of earth! Hi, stretcher-
bearers, come
And carry off what’s left of ’em! Ho, corporal,
bring the rum!
I face the blast on Serbian peaks, where frostbite
gripped our feet
And fever eddied in our blood and slew us in the
heat.
Doiran’s blue lake and red-roofed town, the white
range at the back—
A Turkish village waited there our shivering dawn
attack.
We rustled through the misty woods and spoke with
bated breath;
But soon the glens were roaring with our messengers
of death.
\\ e went in half a thousand men, we came out half
as much ;
Then swapped our fags with swarthy Slavs who’d
fallen in our clutch.
And now I’m a civilian, without a special line.
I’ve tried a dozen different jobs, but failed to make
a shine;
And the girl 1 loved and lived for made a better
choice by far
When she fixed up with a stayed-at-home who owns
a motor-ear.
There’s a restless strain within me which I cannot
tame with work.
I hate the sunless offices, the routine and the irk
Of living cramped between high walls. I can’t go on
a farm—
My leg’s a little out of straight : I've got a withered
arm.
THE CHARTER OF LIBERTY.
CHAIRMAN : “ Comrades, the resolution is ‘That we do all in our
power to stop the deportation of any citizen, whatever his
opinions.' Any dissenter?”
VOICE: “Yes.”
CHORUS: “Chuck 'im out!”
Those souvenirs stick to a man: and that’s the worst
of all.
The best I’ve got are vivid dreams of life that
gave the call.
The passing years have blurred the sad and magnified
the gay—
Come on ! My last remaining pound! I’m on the
spree to-day.
VICTORIA.
H. G. BARWICK.

STOCKINGS
Claret (it’s really more like mulberry)
and blue are the right colors for your summer
frock, if you have not decided on one of
the beflowered chiffons that make you think
of Austin Dobson ladies and china figurines.
The blues range from hydrangea to lupin,
with all the lavendery blues, some just
like jacaranda, in between. If you don’t
wear your sleeves long, the wide tulle scarf
is not only an alluring adjunct but a great
freckle shield for your arms. The insidiously
comfortable basket shoe is taking on a new
lease of life, and white shoes, so dead last
summer, are again to be worn. The Girl
in the Flat Opposite has a pair of uubuek
cunningly strapped with snakeskin. She
has also one of the new flat envelope-bags
in black moire with a clasp in brilliants. If
you have any handbags with handles give
them at once to the South Sea missionaries
for the benighted heathen.
The suburban mayoresses rallied nobly to
the meeting called by their civic queen,
Cecilia Walsh. The gathering was for the
furtherance of the T.B. settlement that
commonsense as well as kindliness demands.
■‘Nothing has been done hitherto for the
married T.B. sufferer with a family,” de-
clared Dr. Arthur in outlining the open-air
village scheme, which will give to each
sufferer and his family a chalet similar to
those in English T.B. settlements. Each
chalet will cost £3OO, and the idea is for each
municipality to raise the cost of at least
one. Carried away by the eloquent earnest-
ness of little Dr. Arthur and Grant Hanlon,
every mayoress pledged herself to set the
movement going in her realm. The Maitland
lady’s appeal, which brought nearly £2OOO
to the funds, was crooned over with delight
during the afternoon.
With the spring come the fetes. They
bloom as regularly as the almond-trees, and
foremost always is the open-air fair for the
Mater, the big R.C. hospital on the North
Shore. This year it was opened by Mrs.
Leahy, one of the Mater’s oldest and staun-
chest. friends —in all the years of its grow-
ing from a little cottage in the gardens which
have now' almost entirely given way to im-
pressive stone buildings, Mrs. Leahy has
been an enthusiastic worker on its behalf. A
marquee large as a circus tent covered the
stalls and their wares, and though this was
conducive to congested traffic it helped to
make the fun.
The dancing season is beginning to look
moth-eaten, and another few' weeks will see
it packed away in camphor-balls. Of the big
fixtures still to cheer the sole of Sydney the
Artists’ Ball —Black and White (somebody
will be black and blue yet if the Palais man-
agement and the committee have many more
pourparlers)—should be the most spectacu-
lar. Although it is to be a beerless night,
the frivollings of vaudeville celebrities will
girdle the hours w T ith good cheer, and there
are weird and wonderful and intrepid cos-
tumes preparing to shimmy under the exotic
lights of Moore Park’s Palace. The 29th’s
the night, the Children’s Hospital the gainer.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite says the
Opera House new show, “The Music Box,”
is probably thus called because there are so
many old wheezes in it. But it is a colorful
show', for all that. Its ballets are numerous
—one in green apparel is particularly tooth-
some—and it has some virgin patches of
spoofing amid the glitter of its sequin desert.
Dot Brunton blows in and out on a laugh
every few' minutes. When she’s not aboard
she’s in the scuppers changing her frock.
One of these is of nasturtium batiked geor-
gette, every shade of the orange reds and
yellow 7 golds of the deep-toned bloom con-
triving to glow in her sleeveless knee-length
frock. This was weighted at the hem with a
lush growth of ruched georgette, and of
course had one of the wide chiffon shoulder-
scarves without w'hieh no self-respecting
dress can go abroad. For her song about the
party—it goes —-
You can bring Tom Walsh
Or any other Bolsh,
But don’t bring Lulu—
she wears a chiffon (it’s just a first-cousin
to georgette) the shade of a purple pansy;
indeed, the skirt, which is slightly full, is
embossed ivith large velvet pansies. The
delectable rig is finished off with a wide and
floppy crinoline, somewhat lighter in tone,
from the back of which a long narrow
streamer of old-rose A'elvet insinuates itself
over the singer’s shoulder. A sheath frock
of gold tissue and an innocent, youthful
affair of flowered chiffon were other raiment
worth an N.B.
“As easy as kiss yer foot” always sounded
an impossible gymnastic feat until a lady in
the harem scene in “The Music Box” slith-
ered like a pet cobra on to the stage-cloth
and started to coil and uncoil herself with
the smoothness of butter and a celerity that
would leave a conjuring reptile a bad second.
With an almost bored nonchalance she glided
to earth in the splits, one leg fore and one
aft. Then she bent backwards as though
stretching for something she had forgotten,
lifted the back foot to the crown of her head
and drew it before her eyes; next, deciding
it was the one she was after, she gave it a
good swing round, like you might when crank-
ing a car, and by one neat and graceful turn
to the left brought the foot up to her mouth.
Next Monday evening, at the Adyar Hall,
Bessie Griffiths will give the first of her fare-
well 'cello recitals. The brilliant player,
who came back to her native land as a mem-
ber of the ill-starred Stralia Concert Com-
pany, has to return to London before the
end of a year to keep some engagements, con-
cert and matrimonial, and this Will be the
last chance Sydney will have to hear her in
the Strauss Sonata in F Major for piano
and 'cello. In this big work Laurence God-
frey Smith will be at the keyboard, and basso
Benham will later unleash his resonant
notes. An afternoon concert on Thursday
at the intimate little hall will be Miss Grif-
fiths’s very last good-bye. Lady de Chair
and daughter Elaine have promised the vice-
regal ear on both occasions.
Bessie has just cabled her “Yes” to an
insistent young man in Northern Italy. He
is Captain Mario Fagioli, of the Sixth Alpini,
and the romance started when the Australian
'cellist was touring Italy last year. After
her farewell season Miss Griffiths and her
mother sail for London, and the marriage
will take place in that city in the church
where Bessie’s two sisters were married.
Educational bigwigs crowded the Turner
Hall, within the Technical College, for Prin-
cipal Thatcher’s second lecture on Early Civil-
isations ; and what the warden of Camden
College doesn’t know about the meanderings
of the Nile from the days of Menes to Tu-
tankhamen would seem like a bit of thistle-
down in the hollow of your hand. The State
Governor was present for the second time,
and brought Elaine and the Captain Lane
Poole couple from Jervis Bay, James Nangle
and George Hooper, of the Technical educa-
tion branch, were front-seaters; so were Dr.
B. N. Morris, Miss V. Roberts and Miss E.
L. Gough (she lectures on women’s handi-
crafts). Mi-. Gundry, the secretary of the
Memorial Scholarship movement that bene-
fits by the lecture, was there, w T earing a
pleased smile and lightweight tailorings. If
you think you are a modern because you are
bobbed or shingled, it may be good for you
to learn that 4000 years B.c. the ladies of
Egypt caricatured the present-day styles
in the Avigs seen in so many of the carvings.
Henna and rouge they also knew; and slides
showing jewellery of great beauty and in-
tricacy of design caused an exclamation
fraught with envy to clip through the room.
Lenore Graham, the lady in the Judith
Fletcher picture alongside, has been chosen for
the second time
to adjudicate in
the City Busi-
ness Houses’
E i s t e ddfod.
Lenore, who
knows Aus-
tralia with the
knowledge that
comes from
many tours
with the Philip
Lytton cos.,
the Dandies
and the Trou-
badours, has
now pitched
her tent in
George - street,
and expounds
dramatic art.
Her ambition
is to foster a
love of Aus-
tralian litera-
ture among her students. She is an ardent
Australian of the third generation, her
great-grandfather having arrived here with
Macquarie—he was one of Australia’s
earliest botanists. Her father was on the
staff of the Argus for many years, and was
a great collector of Australian literature.
Woman captured still another citadel of
man on Saturday night when she invaded
the Commercial Travellers’ Club. But trust
Adam —only the basement and the dining-
room were given over to Eve; meeting
a barrage of paper dolls that unexpectedly
turned into fans if you upended them, paper
caps, streamers and a frieze of black cats,
she was unable to visualise the joys of the
floors above, and didn’t even ask to set foot
in them. The dinner-party was an enormous
success; during the courses songs were sung
in varying keys, and later a group of artists,
among whom the rollicking voice of Charles
Smythe was upraised, took over the even-
ing’s entertainment.
The news by cable of the tragic death in
Java of Mrs. 11. C. Macfie, has almost
stunned a devoted husband, who saw her off
on a pleasure trip only a few weeks ago.
Her travelling companion was Mrs. B. E.
Minns, who, however, did not go on with her
to Garoet, where she was found dead—appa-
rently murdered. The deceased lady was a
charming petite person with a striking crown
of snow-white hair.
A friend drops a line from Jo’burg:—
During the Prince’s visit the invitations for the
civic affairs were nearly all in the hands of town
councillors. Each one had 36 tickets to send out
as he pleased—and the story is that some were
sold for as much as £5O. Anyhow, heaps of well-
lcnowns had no invitations to anything. But the
bookmakers did well —they were well represented
at both banquet and ball. One titled pair—people
who have done untold good for the town —had to
write to the Gov.-General to get them an invitation.
The civic shows were very badly done-—nothing to
drink until midnight at the Civic Ball, and then
only claret-cup and lemonade. In desperation, about
300 people tripped over to the Carlton Hotel and
devoured sandwiches and drink—and more tripped
over, going back. At the races it is said that the
Prince was handed a latchkey tied to a card by
one very enterprising female. Incidentally, he won
£3OO on Sir Abe Bailey’s horse. The Prince
managed to find time to have private parties at
the Carlton Hotel, at which the liveliest of the
buds figured. The University students had a glorious
rag. They drove up to the Rand Club, where the
Prince was staying; he joined them (so everybody
believed) and had a great reception all along the
route. The nurses at the Hospital showered him
with violets, the Boy Scouts gave a military salute,
the University officials received him with clue respect.
And it was only a young man who resembled the
Prince! He spoofed the whole town. The Prince
came along later, got no violets, and thoroughly
enjoyed the joke.
This dark head with the brilliant brown
eves is carried on the shoulders of Rayner
Hoff, who is

classes at the

School in Syd-
ney, and is
also one of the
principals in
charge of the
life classes.
At the present
he is much in

“I mperi a,”
which is one
of the domi-
nating features
of the Society of
Artists’ show.
It is the torso

which every female is doomed by present
fashion to wear. May Moore made the
picture.
St. Philips’s raked in one wmdding fee at
least during last week’s matrimonial slump.
Muriel MacKehzie, of Manly, was the prin-
cipal lady, and Hector Lovett-Cameron, of
London, her leading man. Ivory georgettes
weighted with crystal and Brussels lace cas-
caded over by a foam of tulle veiling clothed
the bride, who was supported by three maids
in blue and silver. Toasts were drunk at
the Ambassadors, with the bride’s sister, Mrs.
Osborne Norris, as hostess. The bride’s
cousin, Padre Ronald Cameron, did the knot-
tying.
Irene James, youngest daughter of the
Justice James couple, is among the about-to-
be-wcds. Her young man is George Seaton,
LL.B., of Waverley.
Another engagement in the Justice James
family is that of only son Otto to Grace
Dettmann, eldest bud of the W. A. Dett-
manns, of Edgeeliff.
Pretty Joan Hester Robinson was married
at St. John’s, in her home town of Gun-
dagai, one night last week, Padre W. S. Mc-
Leod tying the knot that made her Mrs.
Frank Throsby. He’s the.eldest son of the
Throsby Park clan, of Moss Vale, and sister
Nina w 7 as one of the three ’maids who fol-
lowed the bride’s white georgettes and tulle—
the other tw r o were Joan’s sister Betty and
Ivy Horsley, of Yabtree. Pat Donkin was
best man. Toasts and jazz at St. John’s
Hall rounded off the night.
Still another of the Kirkpatrick sisters
of Logan Brae, Bellevue Hill, announces her
engagement. Her young man is Edward
Charles Harris, the clever accompanist to
Althouse and Middleton. He hails from
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Rita and Lily
Kirkpatrick flashed diamond circlets a few
months ago, and Lily is now putting the last
stitches into her trousseau at Colombo.
There wnre 660 well-wishers at the Am-
bassadors the other afternoon to farewell
Ella Goodman. The slim little singer goes
off to Europe to have a top-dressing put on
her soprano notes, and theatrical friends
(Ella made her start with the Melba Opera
Co., and her father was the Firm’s popular
“Goodie” for countless years) were a strong
ingredient in the gathering. Dame Mary
Hughes Avas president of the committee, and
stage favorites Maud Fane, Olive Godwin,
Maurice Price and Harold Broomfield pro-
vided the musical courses.
A. R.’ Richards, of Randwick, the singing
teacher who discovered Clarice Coles, has
been handed something like another Avorld-
contralto by fate. She is Muriel O’Malley,
and on the recommendation of Royal Aca-
demy examiners T. P. Fielden and A. Wesley
Roberts she has been awarded the Ethel
Pedley memorial travelling scholarship.
This scholarship—founded by her two
brothers to perpetuate the memory of Ethel
Pedley, one of the most brilliant pianists of
her day—is open every four years to girl
students under 21.
The Con. quartet was heard in a particu-
larly fine programme of chamber music last
week. Beethoven’s E Flat quartet and
Dvorak’s piano quartet were the works
chosen, and rarely have Gerald Walenn,
Lionel Lawson, Alfred Hill and Gladstone
Bell been in greater sympathy than in the
Beethoven work. Frank Hutchens's artistic
hands took over the piano in the Dvorak
quartet, and Mrs. Goossens-Viceroy sang a
group of French songs to Dorothy Gibbes’s
accompanying.
There were some unrehearsed thrills in
the Players’ production of “The Grand
Cham’s Diamond” the other night. Just at
the stirring moment when everybody is pre-
senting arms at somebody else, doAvn came
the curtain on the most realistic woman’s
scream ever heard in St. James’s. “That’s
not the end,” said somebody. “Prolonging
the suspense,” replied her companion. More
cries behind “the rag.” Then a rather white-
faced young man appeared and announced
that Ken Manning had been rushed to hos-
pital with a smashed hand OAving to the
back-kick of his revolver, wherefore the Grand
Cham’s diamond Avould be pendant for that
night at least. The audience had scarcely
settled down when the same young man
appeared, breathless, to ask if there was a
doctor in the audience, as one of the young
ladies had fainted. Of course there was a
doctor—a nice elderly one, Avho stepped along
to bring comfort to the distressed damsel.
Then still another announcement had to come
(the announcer must have been the original
Greek Chorus —you know, the one in Euri-
pides Avho brings in the descriptions of calami-
ties off-stage). The young Manning whose
revolver had hit the hand that oiled it was
not only the producer but a principal in the
next one-aeter on the bill. However, three
club members, fortunately in the house,
Avould present “The Camberley Triangle.”
Which same they did, and made an unusual
success of it. Another histrionic success was
scored by watchmaker R. B. Orchard, who
under another name (to save alarm, no
doubt) gave a fine performance of the Ameri-
can in Galsworthy’s “Little Man.”
After drinking in the blue of our moun-
tains for some time, Mary O. Stoddart, one
of Maoriland’s best-known artists, sailed for
her home last week. Miss Stoddart studied
in Paris and Italy, and since her return to
her Dominion has exhibited at the Salon
15 times, and is represented again this year.
Sister Brisbane’s budget:—
The Press Institute fed the Imperial Press party
in Vaughan’s Jenolan cafe, where Herbert of London
Punch threw off some aphorisms washed by ripples
of journalistic and lay laughter. (Lady ATolet
Astor talked nicely, too, in a pretty frock with a
pearl and diamond tassel. President C. E. Sligo,
J. J. Knight, Sanderson Taylor, Farmer AYhyte and
other local representatives spoke of many things
while the cold collation Avas receiving the last rites,
the partakers including Major Astor, “Eve Adam”
and her husband, Dr. Bartello, the M. L. Readings,
the Rupert Felsteads, the Percy Reays, Spencer
Brownes, M. Forrest, Charlie Chauvel, the Buza-
cotts and Bryants.
Pursued relentlessly by farewell parties to the

Lady Marjorie Dalrymple paused here on her
way from the Yeast to Maoriland, where she voyages
to , look into Girl Guide politics. She lunched with
S’Matthew at Government House, others in the
party being Mrs. E. H. Macartney and Dorothy
Hawthorn.
Kathleen Lilley told the AVomen’s Club, in a setting
of purple spring blossomry and palms, how books
are made. Eva Lang, Miss McLean and pianist
Millman helped with a musical programme, and Mrs.
Sydney Martin voiced the thanks.
Myrtle and Irene Ward, of Hamilton, gave a
party for Kit Young, who is soon to marry Gordon
Gow. Iceland poppies and souvenir baskets of
sweets were the decorations, and the bride-elect had
a 1 rench powder puff to mark her place.
Ascot is beautifully adorned just now with green
lawns and sweet-smelling spring flowers, and many
pretty summer gowns added to Nature’s splendor at
the September meeting. Mrs. Stanley Chapman chose
navy maroeain with Oriental bordered tunic, Barbara
Sisley was in cinnamon beaded in white, Mrs. Cecil
Palmer in grey with almond green, and Bebe Bul-
eoek displayed red, white and black.

The weather ran true to precedent for the
R.A. Show, both Thursday (judging day)
and Friday (official opening day) being
miserably wet and cold. The committee has
tried at times to spoof the hoodoo by altering
the date; but it hasn’t thought of stretch-
ing a few yards of tarpaulin over the Flem-
ington platform to give a little protection
to patrons by rail. A real back-o’-beyond
siding it is, along which the rain and the
wind on Thursday had straight sailing. Our
own flags were evidently being kept dry for
the opening day, and only the stars and
stripes and the tricolor flapped over the
pavilions. Another innovation was the sing-
ing of “The Old Hundredth” by the multi-
tude when Governor Stradbroke did the
necessary sayings on Friday; some of the
hymning crowd appropriately praised Him
from whom all blessings flow underneath the
shade of the wine kiosk. The pavilion of
Women’s activities had splendid examples
of needlecraft in fascinating lingerie and
beautiful linen. Supper and tray cloths and
other requisites were adorned with. Richelieu,
Hedebo, eyelet, or Mount Mellick embroi-
dery, or bordered with crochet that repre-
sented months of patient toil. Among the
contributors Roma Field, of Temora, stands
out conspicuously with an entirely crocheted
cloth of linen-thread valued at £6O; and an
embroidered headpiece of mauve crSpe de
Chine with a touch of silver also lingers in
the memory—the work of an artist. A
trousseau set by Mrs. Leslie Love had some
of the most exquisite embroidery upon white
silken undies this Chatterer has ever seen.
The food sections showed tempting fare; but
some of the paintings in the fine-arts division
w r ere frankly horrible. Rain prevented close
investigation of the live stock and the gee-
gees in the open, where many of Melbourne’s
crack girl riders of the hunting field are
wont to congregate. But Melbourne’s R.A.S.
is not a social function.
The indissoluble Clara Butt and Ivenner-
ley Rumford were re-welcomed by a full
house at the Auditorium the other evening.
Lady Forster, accompanied by Miss Carle-
ton, smiled from the dress-circle on the two
turtle-doves over a presentation bouquet of
primroses and violets. The baritone be-
trayed in the footlights’ glare the passing
of the years, but it was the same well-
groomed Ivennerley who went smilin’ through
artistically rendered songs. A thinner Clara
than of yore appeared dashingly splendid in
a gown which suggested the Queen of Sheba,
the daughter of the Nile, Yang Kuei-fei, and
other famous ladies of the Orient all in one.
Marie Aussenac, the French pianist, stepped
on the stage like a timid small girl straying
in to her first party. Dainty and young, she
wore vellum-toned chiffon velvet, long of
bodice, joined to a flared flounce of knee-
length, which was half-and-half velvet and
white fur,'with girdle of diamente, and upon
one shapely shoulder she balanced a crimson
rose. The stock of a couple of flower-stalls
with a market-basket of violets was laid
at the contralto’s feet; the pianist sharing
in the spoils. Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Chirn-
side, the Simon Staughtons. the Arthur Bail-
lieu couple and Sunday Baillieu were among
the first-greeters.
Queen Victoria Hospital advanced another
step when Lady Forster laid the foundation-
stone of the new maternity wing which is to
hear her name. Oilskins and gum-boots
weather did not prevent a good roll-up of
admirers of this fine monument of women’s
work for women. President Mrs. Norman
Brookes handed over the usual vegetable
posy, and in welcoming her Ex. gave a
resume of the institution’s growth from an
out-patients’ department at St. David’s Hall,
founded by the late Drs. Constance and Mary
Page Stone and Dr. Clara Stone, to the 70
beds, shortly to be doubled, of the present
house of mercy. The first cot given to the
new wing is associated with the visit of the
U.S. Fleet, for it has been presented by the
employees of Myer’s in memory of their
fellow-worker, Eva Pearce, who died from
the effects of the accident during the route-
march.
The artistic rooms of the Mayoress at the
Town Hall held a midday tea-party to wel-
come Dame Clara Butt and her husband,
Kennerley Rumford, back again. It is 17
years since these singers first unpacked their
notes here, and Australia’s admiration has
been given voice a few times since. Dame
Clara reciprocated the greetings in a gown
of figured crepe marocain in autumn tones,
with coat of kolinsky fur, and a headpiece
garnished in beige. The Mayoress did the
honors in black cloth traced with dull gold
stitching topped by a bat that was black, too.
The dainty French pianist of the concert
co., Marie Aussenac, had a,n all-black toilette
with millinery brightened by a brilliante
ornament. “Pleased to meet you” was also
said to the distinguished artists by Alberto
Zelman on behalf of the musical profes-
sion, by R. J. Oelir for the musical societies,
and by James Gillespie for the general body
of music-lovers.
Back in Melbourne for her second fur-
lough, after six years of Christianising
Papua under the A.8.M., is Ethel Slade,
sister of the vicar of South Broken Hill.
The enthusiastic lady has charge of the
school for native children at Taupota, which
is the nearest mission station to Samarai.
She has the assistance of a native teacher,
and Miss Percy, a qualified nurse, looks
after the menage and helps with the picca-
ninnies. Twelve boys are taken as boarders,
and they do the chores and garden. A system
of irrigation which cost £lO and was engi-
neered by a native permits of the growing of
vegetables and flowers —the roses of Taupota
are famous —and the station has also its own
little dairy herd. Schools are all in the
hands of the various missions, but a Govern-
ment inspector looks in annually. Bible
stories are the chief literary pabulum, but
lately there was great rejoicing among
young and old when Grimm’s Fairy Tales,
translated by Mrs. Money (Anne Kerr), a
former missionary, came their way.
The other afternoon the upper hall of the
Athenmum was decorated two high with the
annual output of that select coterie of artists
known as the Twenty Melbourne Painters.
Interest centred in John Longstaff’s “The
Picture Hat,” whose black-feathered brim
sheltered the features of Jessica Harcourt,
the pretty girl whose looks were lately a
passport from an ushering job at a J.C.W.
theatre to the front row of the chorus. Mrs.
H. M. Gulliver’s “Delphiniums” also checked
the eye traffic. Wesley headmaster L. A.
Adamson had a few things to say about the
criticism that has been levelled at the pur-
chases made by the trustees of the National
Gallery. A poser for the Twenty to unravel
was, “Would the councils of the trustees be
marked by. a greater clarity and be freer
from jealousy if artists had the judging of
their fellows?” That did seem like hitting
below the belt. J. T. Tweedle, whose wife
is one of the score, introduced the visitor.
Among the patrons were the Allen dame and
daughter Mary. Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy Dyer,
Dr. and Mrs. Stevens and Baldwin Spencer.
The Lyceum Club said good-bye across
the dinner-table to former president Dr.
Georgina Sweet the other night. Mrs. J. G.
Latham, her successor, chaired the gathering
and proposed the toast that mattered, being
humorously supported therein by Miss Webb,
who companioned the doctor on a trek some
years ago in S’Africa. Included in the fare-
well was Miss Jessie Patterson, who sees
the traveller as far as Java. A pleasant and
unexpected interlude was the presentation to
the doctor of a small bas-relief plaque of a
charming maiden with extended hand offer-
ing a rose—Margaret Baskerville was both
donor and sculptor of the clever thing.
Here is Rita Hope, one of Melbourne’s
leading teachers and solo pianists. In pri-
vate life Mrs.
A. Percy
Shier, with a
home, a hus-
b a n d and
family of three
to care for,
she has made
but few ap-
pea.ranees
since her mar-
riage. Persua-
sion lately led
he r to an-
nounce a
Brahms reci-
tal at the Mel-
bourne Music
Club, with vio-
linist Margery
Gray. Ri t a
Hope is among
the very few
A n st ralians
lucky enough
to call herself a pupil of Leschetizky—she
had three years under the maestro’s guid-
ance in Vienna. A recital in London at
the Bechstein Hall (now the Wigmore) gained
lier many laurels.
Arum-lilies clustered round the platform
and grand piano on Saturday night at the
Assembly Hall when Hilda Roberts, of the
Conservatorium staff, filled the dull chamber
with finely-interpreted harmony. The artist
—she has established a claim to the title
—wore a frock of golden-brown velvet, which
toned nicely with a fair shingled coiffure. A
unique programme consisted entirely of vari-
ations, representing works of seven com-
posers, ranging from Beethoven to Benjamin
Dale. The Bananaland pianist added fur-
ther variation to the usual tyro’s perform-
ance by playing with warmth, color, breadth
and understanding, and woke the audience
to keen admiration.
Madeline Rossiter, who is one of the direc-
tors of a big Eastern theatrical enterprise,
took to India by the Mongolia 12 clever Aus-
tralians to strengthen her co., now appear-
ing in Calcutta. Among them were Connie
Milne, an old J.C.W. favorite; Nona Wil-
kins, a Sydney singer; Gertrude Johns, a
graceful Melbourne tripper, with J.C.W.
training; and Harrington Reynolds, who
goes as juvenile lead.
Most attractive wares cun he' found on the
prettily-decorated stalls of an Eastern Gar-
den which blooms for a fortnight in the
grounds of the Catholic Ladies’ College. The
Administrator, the Very Rev. J. J. Lonergan,
opened the gate. T. M. Burke presidents
and J. P. Burke secretaries the fete, which
aims at chipping pieces off the debt on the
school. Extra attractions nightly will be
a band or orchestral performance, with danc-
ing in one of the classrooms for the younger
set.
Cabled the other day that the Australian
authors Neville Joske and Margot Goyder,
whose c o m-
bined brains
have produced
three success-
ful novels
under the pen-
name of “Mar-
got Neville,”
have sold the
film rights of
their latest.
“Safety First,”
to a big movie
c o r p oration.
No doubt
there will
have to be a
change of title,
for Harold
Lloyd has a
prior claim to
that one. Pic-
tured here is
Neville, th e
elder of the
two talented sisters, who are at present in
London deep in the preparation of a fourth
book.
Old Hutchins (Hobart) School boys will
be glad to bear that Major Guy Wylly,
V.C., who used to be the fat boy of the
school, has been appointed military secretary
to “Birdie,” now Commander-in-Chief in
India. Wylly won the second V.C. in the
SlAfrican dispute, Graeme Bisdee (now
Lieut.-Colouel), another old boy of the same
school, having prevented him garnering in
the first. He is quite an old hand in India
now. He was one of Kitchener’s aides when
the silent soldier was C.-in-C. there; and
after the Armistice (he was in the first
Anzac Corps) he went earning “mentions”
on the nor’-west frontier.
Scott’s Hotel housed a combined dance
and card-party one night last week, the pro-
ceeds going towards the commissariat of the
Girl Guide entertainment at. Federal Gov-
ernment House on October 15. Mrs. Arthur
Woolcott, District Commissioner for St.
Kilda, who has sworn with Mrs. J. H. Keat-
ing to provide the tea and cake for almost
an infinitude of patrons, was commanding-
officer on this occasion, and was assisted by
many energetic lieutenants peddling flowers.
Mrs. J. H. Ilewison, hon. organiser of the
coming effort, in cloak of grey chenille em-
bossed georgette over a gown of similar hue,
used her persuasive powers in the sale of
mysterious envelopes. Lady Helena Rous,
in black velvet with short coat of white fur
represented her mother; Justice Cussen’s
daughter Alice, in jade-tone, accompanying
her.
A recent wedding that interested a crowd
of women workers was Sheila Sutherland’s,
because Sheila is the founder and proprietor
of the very flourishing Melbourne Book Club.
The ’groom, Allen Gilfillan. is a lawyer who
dabbles in literature as well—lie lias a novel,
“Cooeeville,” and some plays, to his credit.
The ceremony and reception were at the
Lyceum Club, the bridal arrav being of
antique brocade and lace of primrose hue and
toning tulle veil, with posy of violets and
primroses. Mimi Gregory, in frock of forget-
me-not blue taffeta, was auntie’s bridesmaid.
Mrs. Gilfillan will still retain her interest in
her artistic business, where amid a setting
of Turkish carpets and subdued lights the
most charmimr and original articles of the
art world are to be found. Her father was
the literary Alexander Sutherland; mother
still lives at Canterbury.
The artists got together for the benefit of
elocutionist Charlotte Hemming, who is not
making rapid recovery from a serious acci-
dent, and cannot join in fight for a living
for some time. The Playhouse staged varied
offerings, including a sketch irom “David
Copperfield” by the Dickens Dramatic Club,
and a scene from “Richard III.” by Mr. and
Mrs. J. H. Hopkins. Mrs. Alberto Zelman
warbled French songs, and the Melbourne
Symphony Orchestra filled in the gaps be-
tween other numbers. The fund for tne
artist will be heaped up to the- extent ot
over ±lOO by the entertainment and a rame
of two pictures presented by Mrs. Harrison
Moore and Mrs. Phillips Fox.
Rita Fleming (Mrs. Charles Niglitingall)
put on a worth-while programme for her
elocutionary recital at the Playhouse, and
also treated a big house to two attractive
evening gowns, one black, sprinkled with;
beads, the other of glistening lemon. In the.
“As You Like It” excerpt the lady was a
shapely Rosalind in brown.
Rosa Walton, whose line is monologues'
and songs at the piano, goes across to Sydney
shortly to join the Carrie Lancely trio for
a season at the Haymarket.
Mrs. E. D. Gilchrist, who used to be
Beatrice Usher, of the Brough eo., is back
in Melbourne: her husband has been trans-
ferred from the Sunset State to R. W. Cam-
eron and Co.’s business here. The ex-
theatrical lady’s present hobby is home-
hunting.
Melbourne’s old eyclorama, which has been
a stadium as well as other things, will see
yet another . term of usefulness. Before it
is dismantled to nafike room for new buildings
in connection with St. Vincent’s Hospital, it
will serve as a charity Paddy’s Market, where
on certain days weekly everything from a fur
coat to dried fish will be on sale. St.
Vincent’s will benefit by the enterprise, which
has been engineered by some kindly folk.
Adelaide notes:—
Two tales of woe come from the Show—one from
the Limbless Soldiers, who found that someone had
made a harvest by selling, at 2s. each, buttons in
their aid and decamping with the proceeds; and
one from the S.P.C.A., which is the poorer by most
of the photographs displayed in its tent. For some
years the Society has done useful propaganda with
a Chamber-of-Horrors exhibit on the grounds—photo-
graphs of starved, diseased and tortured animals it
has rescued, and instruments of torture it has con-
fiscated. Many of them, with the Society’s records,
were lost in the Richards Building fire, and now some-
one with unusual tastes has annexed its only remain-
ing photographs. The übiquitous small boy is sus-
pected, and parents are asked to give an eye to his
glory holes.
A fresh start has been made with the Anzac
Highway that some day is to run from Keswick to
Glenelg, and trees stoutly guarded have been planted
under the benediction of the Premier and Attorney-
General. The scheme was mooted some time ago,
but the few saplings fell victims to cattle or vandals.
The Government and National Roads Association are
backing it now, and private subs, include £5OO from
Sidney Kidman and £250 from Malcolm Reid.
The University Choral Society, under Frederick
Bevan’s baton, undertook the programme for the last
Conservatorium concert and gave excellent renderings
of Mendelssohn’s “Athalia’’ and Handel’s “Acis and
Galatea.” With Sylvia Whitfngton as leader, the
orchestra was bound to be good, and Professor Darnley
Naylor’s perfect modulation made him an excellent
reader in “Athalia.”
Mrs. A. K, Goode has been telling woman about
herself, with the members of the Liberal Women’s
Educational Association as audience. She is an indus-
trious compiler and forceful speaker, and backed her
own views by quoting from such contemporary writers
as the two Vaertings, Elizabeth Robins and W. L.
George.
Half a dozen women have combined in an excellent
arts and crafts show in the Society of Arts rooms—
pastels from Dora Wilson, oils and water-colors from
Mrs. W. G. Torr and Elizabeth Wright, photography
from Esther Legoe, china painting from Mrs. Nenner,
and laces and embroideries from Alison Hale. The
pastels and photographs are the outstanding features.
The fortunate infant who still believes in fairies is
to have a book of them, for which Pixie Harris is
doing both illustrations and verse (she is over here,
arranging publication) and Lilian Tardley is writing
the stories.
Koovonga golfers hung the Osborne Hall with the
club colors of gold, green and grey for their dance,
and filled great brass bowls and hanging baskets with
broom, daffodils and gum-leaves. Mrs. Herbert
Rymill, whose husband founded the club, and Mrs.
Frank Hareus (her husband is its secretary) planned
the scheme and empanelled a feminine committee
to help them. Otherwise the frivol was run by a
purely masculine committee, and run uncommonly
welL
The beggar’s bowl has been working overtime
among Show-time visitors—and others. The Hospital
Day collection realised £700; and the Babies’ Hospi-
tal and the T.B. Soldiers-’ Aid Society have had
successful efforts in their behalf.
Adelaide has just made up its account over the
band-instruments provided by subscription for the
battleship of that name. The fund collected was
£7OO, but the outfit cost under £5OO. So the citi-
zens have sent to H.M.A.S. Adelaide a silver shield
bearing the city arms, also £5O as a “band fund,”
and still have enough cash to get—with the consent
of the subscribers—£l2o worth of less ambitious
instruments for a local institution for the blind.
The new hotel scheme, long in the air in Adelaide,
has now come down to ground—-between the Adelaide
Club and the Liberal Club, opposite Government
House. Barlow and Hawkins, of Melbourne, will
design a building of 11 storeys or so, Ken Milne
and Evans having charge of the local work; and
Thomas Carylon will bring his experience to the
job of manager. The cost is estimated at £200,000.

Play the Game
The amount of benefit you derive from a game depends upon the amount of
energy you put into it—and the enthusiasm behind that energy. To play any game
half heartedly is unsportsmanlike—and unfair to an opponent. The interest you take
in a game is infinitely more pronounced when you are satisfied with the materials
you use —the materials that emphasise the difference between good play and indifferent.
The same enthusiasm which has made Australia great over the playing fields
of half the world has been the life-blood of Mick Simmons’ big business; and the
reputation of the World’s Greatest Sports Store is in the hands of every customer.

NOTIONS
Hailed as ‘a world-beater” by some, and
as “the colt of the century” by others, Manfred
let the rhapsodists down very badly in the Hill
Stakes at Rosehill on Saturday. He looked hand-
some enough for anything as he stood before the
camera men, and on the track that morning he had
galloped two in 24. Also, McShortodds demanded
3 to 1, and there was very little of that. But
after leaving the barrier smartly and being second
into the straight, the bay was settled in a few
strides by The Hawk (6’s), who had landed from
Maoriland (where he was no use to Gloaming) only
18 days before and had done very little fast work.
It was as much as Manfred could do to beat the
aged Maltster stallion Admetus, from whom he was
receiving 191 b.; and Admetus was probably not in
his best Queensland form—according to the well-
informed Courier scribe, he was going off when he
left Brisbane. Certainly the Victorian colt finished
well ahead of the other four, but Spearfelt is not
a miler, nor are Wallace Mortlake, Polyeletan and
Ceo in the w.f.a. class. It was a disappointing
exhibition on the three-year-old’s part when aU
is said and done. The Hawk, who was superbly
ridden by Pike (there is a perfect understanding
in this ease between horse and jockey), galloped
the mile iii lmin. 38Jsec., and could easily have
trebled the margin (a length) that separated him
from the boom colt.
Amounis, starting at 6 to 4 on in the Rosehill
Guineas, registered his fourth successive victory,
the nine furlongs being traversed in lmin. 644 sec.
Vaals (6 to 2) offered a stout resistance, and was
only a neck behind at the close, but Bracken was
of little assistance to the Magpie—Loved One geld-
ing, who lost his position after getting away well
and made his run late —almost too late, it moment-
arily seemed. He has proved himself the best of
the Sydney three-year-olds, but those he has defeated
with the exception of the leggy Vaals (and he
is no wonder) are a poor lot. In fact, the 1925-26
three-year-olds are decidedly inferior to the 1924-25
batch. The better of Amounis and Manfred (Man-
fred it may be) should win each Derby, but this
page can’t see either annexing the Melbourne Cup
or accounting for Windbag, Heroic, The Hawk,
Spearfelt and eo. at w.f.a.
The Camellia Stakes at Rosehill generally throws
some light on the Epsom Handicap at Randwiek.
Last year Blackadder won both, but in this year’s
Stakes, though a 6-to-4 favorite, he was no match
for little Chatterbox (9 to 2), who never runs a
bad race. Chatterbox has been withdrawn from
the Epsom, but she will make things very sultry
for the Victorians in the V.R.C. Cantala Stakes, in
which she has 7st. 91b. (151 b. less than on Saturday),
if the younger Kelso can contrive to keep her in
the splendid condition in which she was produced
on Saturday. Hit finished within a length of
the winner after being disappointed of a run on the
rails, and must be given a chance in the Epsom
with 6st. 121 b. Two other Epsom candidates in
Baldwin (5 to 4) and Red Gauntlet (7 to 4) fought
out a great finish in the Highweight Handicap, for
which the public wanted nothing else, although
there were 16 other starters. Baldwin, with a
stone the better of the weights (there is only 61b.
between them in the Epsom), worried the big
fellow out of it in the last 100yds., but his
Epsom prospects may not be improved by the
gruelling struggle he had to undergo. He did not
thrive on racing in his two-year-old days; however,
he may be more robust, now. The second horse’s
gallant fight with lOst. 51b. up (the seven furlongs
were covered in lmin. 25fsec., only fsec. slower
than Chatterbox’s time) supplied further evidence
of the Kelso stable’s strong representation in the
Epsom, with Boaster at Bst. lib. and Red Gauntlet
at 7st. 10lb. Nevertheless, Honan (Bst.) will be
this page's Epsom choice, provided all goes well
with the dashing English chestnut.
A sterling performance was that of Pilliewinkie
(6’s) in the Rosehill Cup. With 31b. more than his
Metropolitan Handicap burden, 9st. 71b., the great
little weight-carrier from M.L. was running away
from Royal Roue (15’s), Strongbow (6’s) and 10
others at the end of the 11 furlongs, which he
left behind in the course-record time of 2min.
18jsec., and he did not get the best of passages
at that. Pilliewinkie was in a bit better condition
than some of his opponents, notably Solidify, who
looked dangerous at the entrance to the straight,
and Strongbow, who needs a more powerful rider,
but his achievement was full of merit all the same.
Favorite for the Cup was Valamita. who looked
sluggish and ran accordingly. A more experienced
trainer would have kept him in his stable after
that strenuous race in the Chelmsford Stakes seven
days before, when the overworked son of Valais —
Tressamita ran a great second to Windbag after
stumbling in the straight; but he is trained by
his owner, a Sydney restaurateur, who apparently
thinks horses are made of cast-iron. Since August.
1924, Valamita has had 24 races, most of them
this year. He has been in training since February,
except for a brief spell after his Rosehill success
in July. In the circumstances, he will be a marvel
if he wins the Caulfield Cup on October 17. Yet
if a man like Booth or Kelso had had the handling
of him he would have been a fair thing for one of
the big Spring handicaps, at least.
* * * *
McShortodds was a joyful man when
Royal Charter (10 to 9 on), from the Holt stable,
was downed in a tight finish by Mountain Prince (50
to 1) in the 10 furlongs handicap at Mentone (\ic.)*
The Comedy King—Polylogy gelding certainly earned
121 b. above his Melbourne Cup weight, but the
opposition was weak. Perhaps he would have done
better if Harrison had let him stride along in
front instead of holding him back to his field ; but,
all things considered, it was not an imposing
performance. Mountain Prince is a four-year-old
gelding by Mountain King—Tontalda. “E. M. Mel-
rose ” who owns him, had another success with
Flying Princess (7 to 1) in the six-furlongs handicap;
she won in a walk from Chelidon and Pluto. The
Prince and the Princess are trained by A. Mortimer.
McShortodds had a- good deal the better of the argu-
ment with punters, as no favorite was successful
during the day. After the second race, Holt gave
Heroic another barrier lesson in company with a
stable-mate, Master Vibrator. The chestnut, who
looked a picture of condition, hopped out of the
machine in great style, and Holt wore the pleased
look of a man who, with infinite patience, _ has
taught a capricious champion manners. Heroic is
a warm favorite for the Caulfield Cup.
“D.E.”: Twenty-four hours or so after the last
race at Mentone the grandstand burst into flames,
and as the firemen could do nothing with the
available water supply, £16,000 worth of race-
course buildings—the Argus is my authority went
up in smoke. As usual, it is surmised that “a
carelessly dropped match or cigarette” started the
trouble, but there have been so many grandstand
fires during the last year or two that I have my
doubts. There was one blaze at Rosehill (N.S.W.),
another at Caulfield, another in Tasmania —all very
extensive and costly to those concerned —and now
we have this Mentone affair. I have a theory that
they might all be traced to some morbid punter
who wont broke on a sure thing and resolved to get
even with the racing world by firing grandstands.
SHIRLEY WHITE, a pillar of the W.A.
Trotting Association, the most prosper-
ous institution of its kind in the Com-
monwealth.
Or else to some crazed Puritan—a modern John
Brown of wowserdom —who thinks to cure Australia
of horse-gambling by burning down the places to
which horse-gamblers resort.
The retirement of George Bone from the
post of starter in Adelaide has set the racing clubs
hunting for competent new men. S.A. Jockey Club
is giving a trial to George Morphett, and Tattersall s
to Wallace from Broken Hill. An even more im-
portant change is that in the stipendiary stewards.
Ever since they were appointed ttiey have been un-
changed ; Hogan as chairman, with lawyer Tom
Wigley and Clem Hill. Hogan and Wigley had
some angry words lately, and the Jockey Club,
siding with Hogan, has given Wigley notice that his
engagement is terminated. But it is likely that
the last has not been heard of the matter.
* * * *
“The Rumpus”: The cloanest daylight
robbery I ever witnessed happened at Canning Park
(W.A.) racecourse. From out the gaping mouth of
a bookie’s bag the tip of a fiver showed prominently
as a well-dressed backer sidled up to inquire the
price of a horse. Purposely he spoke low, as if
anxious that his good information should not be
overheard by listeners-in, and the bookie leaned for-
ward to catch the name. “What price Shakealeg?”
asked the backer, leaning forward too. “Tens,”
whispered McShortodds. “Fifty t’ five,” said the punter,
the £5 note coming straight up from the bookie’s
bag. Fate, however, frowned on the trick —Shake-
aleg ran fourth.

Til don. who has had a mortgage on the
U.S. lawn-tennis championship since 1920, retained
his title at Forest Hills last week, defeating his old
opponent W. M. Johnston in a five-set match. Borotra,
Laeoste, Harada, Anderson and Norton tackled the
Americans, but none of them reached the semi-finals;
Anderson was beaten in four sets by veteran Wallace
Johnson (he is 36), whom Tilden vanquished in
J. B. GARGUREVITCH, assistant-secretary
of the V.A.T.C. for 35 years. He has
just resigned.
straight sets. The usual excuses have been made for
Anderson, but seeing that Laeoste licked him at
Wimbledon, Borotra in the Davis Cup round and
Johnson, now a second-rater, in the U.S. singles,
excuses will no longer serve.
* * * *
“Gwy”: Duncan Thompson, the slippery
Toowoomba (Q.) half-back, is showing signs oi
joining those who have given up football for a less
Strenuous sport, in this case, tennis. The inter-
national has only taken it up seriously during the
past couple of years, but he is improving fast,
being quick on his feet and having a natural apti-
tude for the game. Lack of inches is likely to bo
his most serious handicap, although there is no
reason why he should not develop into a neat-
volleying, agile little player, of the type of Stanley
Doust, who makes up for shortcomings otherwise by
his mobility. And Doust has lasted longer than
many of the whirlwind order.

Victorian cyclists were to the fore in the
annual road races from Goulburn to Sydney. In
the amateurs’ handicap, the scratch man, R. W.
Lamb, gave away long starts to a big batch of
riders and won with a minute to spare in 6hr.
17min. 55sec. —wonderful time for 124 miles. The
brothers N. S. and A. L. Quinton, also from Victoria,
were secend and third. The professionals’ race was
won by D. Brooks, of Bathurst, from the 40min.

Cruise (Vic.) secured second prize and fastest time—
6hr. 26min. 35see.

After the return match between Walter
Miller and Ike Robin had lasted a couple of rounds,
many people at the Melbourne Stadium would have
been glad if Walter had adhered to his resolution,
expressed after: the first bout, not to give away so
much weight again. It was an uninspiring struggle,
and the massive Maori seemed to have too much
strength altogether for his lighter, though well-knit,
opponent. He got a fall in the third round, and
Miller was very much second-best until the. ninth
canto, when, securing a grip which did not look
nearly as painful as Robin made it out to be, he
caused his opponent to tap the mat. Bridges awarded
the contest to Miller on points. A doubtful decision.
* * * *
Harry Collins, the Newcastle shopman,
settled all arguments as to who is middleweight
champion of Australia by whipping Alf Stewart, the
Victorian, in 17 rounds at the* Rushcutter Bay Stadium
on Saturday night. Stewart is a, bigger edition of
Harry Gordon, which means that he is an obstinate
receiver with a dangerous punch. It took about
18 months to induce Collins to give Stewart a match,
and it took 50 minutes and 49 seconds of actual
boxing to convince Alfred that champion he was not.
The Victorian fought stubbornly and endured much
before terrific rights to the chin put him down and
out. Collins was favorite at 3 to 1 on.

Having won eight out of nine matches in
Maoriland, the N.S.W. Rugby Union XV tackled the
All Blacks —the real All Blacks —at Auckland and
found them too strong, the forwards especially. The
visitors played manfully in the opening- half, which
closed with M.L. 5 points to nil; and after 30
minutes’ play in the second half it was 16 to 10 in
Maoriland’s favor. Then the invaders went to
pieces the home team putting on another 20 points
to nii. Still it is no disgrace to be defeated by
the finest XV in the world. Toby, of the Sydney
Y.M.C.A., is praised for his fine work at full-back:
“the equal of Nepia,” one account says. At Welling-
ton on the same day the Queensland Rugby Leaguers
piled up a cricket score against the Maorilanders —
44 points to 20. In their three representative
matches in the Dominion they scored 103 points
to 50.

A perfect September afternoon ; a fast,
open, clean, strenuous game, undecided till the last
moment; an appreciative crowd of 59,905, and a
“gate” of £2963 13s. sd.—that sums up the first
Vic. League semi-final on Saturday, between Essendon
and Collingwood. All but a few disappointed ’Don
barrackers "were well satisfied —even umpire McMurray
came in for cordial cheers. The ’Dons excelled in high-
marking, but the Magpies were surer in handling and
their system was in better nick, though not so
mechanical as it has been. The Magpies are an
even team, though perhaps Tyson, Gordon, Coventry,
Harris and Webb stood out a little; of the ’Dons,
Frank Maher, who roves among figures in the Com-
monwealth Statistician’s office during the week,
Rowley Watt, Donaldson and Garden were the best.
The Magpie forwards had had extra practice at goal-
kicking during the week, and that just about
accounted for the difference in scores: Collingwood,
12 goals 6 behinds; Essendon, 10 goals 8 behinds.
“Gobble”: Collingwood’s consistent success in Mel-
bourne League football is due very largely to
reliance on its own juniors and the flat rate of
payment. While other clubs have bought civil war
and low places on the list by paying big money
to country champions, the Magpies have pursued a
peaceful and victorious way. In 34 years of their
League existence they have missed the finals only
four times. Last year and the previous season they
were not as good as usual owing to a rush for theii
stars to instil Dick Condon's unique “system” into
metropolitan and bush clubs. In 1923 there were
11 of the best Magpies coaching other teams, in-
cluding the great centre line, Drummond, Pannam,
Twomey; the star followers, Wallon and McCarthy ;
their two rovers, Laxton and Dobrigh ; and a brainy
captain, Lumsden. Dick Lee, greatest of goal-
getters, also retired then. Dismal Jeremiahs pre-
dicted for Collingwood a decade barren of honors.
Yet in two years it has replaced all these players,
except Lee, has won its way into the final, and has
a good chance of jerking up the premiership pennant.
The big suburban districts continue to be
most prominent in all Adelaide games. Sturt is
the present holder of the cricket premiership. East
Torrens has gone top in baseball, in both A and B
grades. The two met in the lacrosse final, and
Sturt won it easily. The same day they met in
the first football semi-final, and Norwood (which is
the same as East Torrens, but has been allowed to
retain the old name) got home after a great struggle.
In the second semi-final West Torrens licked Port
Adelaide by 60 to 53. and the winners will play
Norwood on Saturday.
“Henry Pannikin" : For 30 years old Ned.
a whiskered cocky, claimed to have been supreme at
tossing the caber in all the district sports, and for
another 30 he bragged of his past achievements.
Someone asked Ned one day what length a caber
should be. “Don’t know ther regylation,” replied
the zi tied prodigy, “but in me young days we used
ter fall a saplin’", or a tree yer might say, and keep
on bunkin’ lumps off until I could turn ’er. Then
it was a caber.”
* * * *
“0.p.": Old Bill Beach kept his 75th
birthday on September 0. Although it is 3S years
since he retired after defeating Ned Hanlan on
the Nepean River, the veteran still takes the
keenest interest in the sport, and a championship
race in Australia without Beach as umpire is
hardly imaginable. It was in 1884 that Beach, on
the Parramatta, electrified the whole rowing world
bv his victory over Hanlan (of Canada). The
latter had defeated Ned Trickett on the Thames and
Elias Laycock on the Nepean, but he proved no
match for the thick-set 35-year-old blacksmith,
previously an unknown. For three years Beach held the
title, defeating T. Clifford, Hanlan and N. Matterson
on the Parramatta in 1885; Jake Gaudaur and
Wallace Ross on the Thames in 1886 ; and Hanlan
again in 1887. Beach’s seven wins are the best in
the history of the sculling championship ; his nearest
competitors are Jim Stanbury (six), Ernest Barry
(Eng,), R. Chambers (Eng.), Dick Arnst (M.L..),
Peter Kemp and Hanlan (five each) ; and George
Towns (four).
• * * *
“Wink" : Matt Ellis, one of the Vie.
cricket selectors, has been trying to explain away
the damning fact that the said selectors* kept
Ponsford and Grimmett out of big cricket for years.
Says Matthew: “We taught Ponsford the game, and
picked him as soon as we could,” which is absurd.
Again: “We discovered Grimmett, and in the first
inter-State match after the war he represented Vic-
toria. He proved a champion for our side in only
one innings (in 1923) and he then left our State.”
The apologist forgot to mention that Grimmett in
that first match was given six overs only, and that
for the next four seasons, though easily the best
bowler in the pennant competition, he was dropped
from the Sheffield Shield team. Matthew’s remarks
may go down with that large body of the public
whose memories are only one season long, but w>t’:
them only.
* * * *
“A.H.” : My recollections of tlie late W.
Bruce as a cricketer were gained entirely during the
1886 tour in England; in that year he struck me
as a batsman who always looked like making runs
but seldom did. Something of this impression _is
reflected in a paragraph in the London Times which
recalls that Bruce was fche first left-handed batsman
whom Australia sent to England, but was destined
to be eclipsed by his successors in that line- —Hill,
Darling, Ransford and Bardsley—because, with all
his style and elegance, he lacked defensive power.
The Times commentator, however, found another
reason for Bruce’s lack of success in 1896; he was
a lad of only 22, and “the tour of that year was
an unhappy business, marred from the opening match
reason for Bruce’s lack of success in 1886 ; he was
plished some big things in Australia in the inter-
vening years, Bruce showed his real quality on
English wickets. He scored 1314 runs during the
tour for an average of 23 ; his biggest innings was
191, but his best was 68 in the third Test at Man-
chester.
THE SCAPEGOAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Several witnesses deposed that at the conclusion
of the game between the West Melbourne Ramblers
and Stony Park, a concerted rush was made for
the umpire, who was chased off the field. Amos
Dees, printer, of Brunswick, said he was the umpire.
‘You have no scars?’ the magistrate asked. ‘They
did not catch me,’ witness replied.”
“I see a figure tearing in front of yelling, swearing,
Implacable pursuers exuding fearsome threats.
Exasperated punters, I take it, are the hunters,
Their quarry is a welsher who hasn’t paid his
bets.
And, if they overhaul him, it looks as if they’d
maul him
And duck him, if there’s water handy, for crude
redress. :
Poor- wretch, for all his swindles, his plight one’s
pity kindles!”
“No, brother, not a welsher —you’ve got another
guess:’ ’
“Then is it—tell me candid —some crook they caught
red-handed
But who from arms detaining incontinently broke?
One of those vile banditti infesting Melbourne city
Who hold the Law in mockery and make the cops
a joke?
The sort of tough who’ll sandbag a man or nick the
handbag
That every woman carries, from 'neath the owner’s
nose ?
Some midnight hold-up plotter, some damnable
garrotter?”
“Brother, you’re still in error, it isn’t one of
those.”
“Sniteher? Sly-grog informer? —now am 1 getting
warmer ?
Stool-pigeon, that detectives their wanted men may
nab ?
Or are these seamen striking, who seek this way of
spiking
The guns of some backslider regarded as a scab?
May Heav’n from danger snatch him! They’ll kill
him if they catch him.
What was the crime that calls for such brutal
vengeance, say!”
“Dreams, brother, far-fetched visions! He gave
some bad decisions.
It’s just a football umpire who's calling it a day.”

THE INKY WAY.
J. M. Walsh, writer of crime and adventure serials
and frequent contributor to The Bulletin, is getting
himself known in London. John Hamilton, Ltd., has
just accepted for book-publication his “The White
Mask,” a crime story which ran as a serial in the
Sun Pictorial.
“Gallery Hand”: Although Hansard does not
record the remark, Prank Clarke, President of Vic.
Plush Chambah, is credited by fellow members with
having, as a private member in committee, besought
Cohen, K.C., to approach the discussion of the Films
Censorship bill “in a Christian spirit.”
Eighty-five on September 15, and still in journal-
istic harness on the Free Press, Kilmore (Vic.),
Tom Hunt was birthday-greeted by a number
of Melbourne friends as “bland and reverent dean
of editors” in a blank-verse eulogy by P. J. Mul-
laney. The signatures included T. P. Mclnerney,
LL.D., and Parliamentarians Watt, Peacock, Malonev,
Prendergast, Angliss and Findley.
“Fitz”; 1 offer the following letter, which fell
breathless into the Molong (N.S.W.) council chamber
the other day, as a bright example for all sub-editors:
( “The Mayor and Aldermen.
“Gentlemen,- —There is a dead horse near my house
in Boree Hollow and I want you to remove it at once.
“Yours truly,
“P.S.—He stinks.”
How the pithiness of that P.S. would have delighted
the heart of J. F. Archibald!
“Hamer”; The news of the death of P. T. Freeman
gave me genuine sorrow. Freeman, with his big
schoolboy scrawl, wrote rather painfully, and the Inky
Way for him was a rough, unmetalled track. He
produced a few very good stories, but his output
was small and his earnings were to match; yet he
liked the hard road and plugged along it happily.
His old overcoat, patched together, will always cling
in my memory—a token of a man who made the best
of very little. I often wondered why he kept to a
path that gave him so little reward ; but he was as
blithe in his hardships as many of us who had much
fewer of them.
i’-X.”; I don’t think Sir Frank Newnes, of the
British Press party, visited the township which was
named after his father, George Newnes, the first
baronet. Yet there are few more interesting spots
in N. S. Wales—when you get to it. The baronet,
having made a fortune out of Tit Bits, was induced
to put a heap of money into the Commonwealth Oil
Corporation; and the town that grew up around
the ill-placed works in the very picturesque Wolgan
Valley, 70 miles or so from Sydney, was given his
name. He never got anything else out of it. From
Tit Bits grew Newnes, Ltd., which nowadays has
a string of magazines, including that best of the
newer weeklies, John o' London's.
While Grenfell (N.S.W.), his birthplace, Abbots-
ford (N.S.W.), where he passed through the golden
sliprails, and Australia in general forgot, Footscray
(Vic.) remembered the third anniversary of Henry
Lawson’s death. On a Sunday afternoon a fortnight
back a thousand or more assembled in Footscray
Park to pay homage to the dead singer at a com-
memoration service. E. J Holloway (Trades Hall),
A. J. Sullivan (Gordon Pilgrimage Committee), the
Mayor of Footscray and others remembered nice
things about the poet; J. P. Dean recited “Star
of Australasia” and J. Grace “Faces in the Street” ;
and the Footscray brass band contributed. Apropos
the inclusion of the band, Henry often said that
he hoped a band would go to his funeral, whoever
else stayed away.
“Theodoric”: The invasion of Australia by a
Press Conference excites the question; “When is a
pressman?” It is the fond illusion of those who
push pens for a living that presswork is a literary
craft and the Press a vehicle for specialised effort
which finds an outlet in the written word. But
it seems that the representative Press-kings of the
world are those who invest in newspaper shares
just as they put money into companies which
exploit motor-cars, beer or sausage casings. So
we see flocking to conference as Australian “dele-
gates” not the great prose-artists of the Common-
wealth, nor the great editors who mould the
opinions and thereby the destinies of a continent,
but the general managers, the chairmen of directors,
the governing shareholders, men who perhaps never
wrote an original line in their lives. No doubt it
is as it should be—it is the business side that counts.
But why not call it a Conference of Investors in
Printed Periodicals?
“R.M.H.”; The article by “T.8.C.” (B. 27/8/’2E)
on “Unconscious Libel” recalls that when George
Moore wrote “Lewis Seymour and Some Women” he
had not the least idea that he was taking liberties
with the patronymic of a fairly well known music-
hall artist. The latter, nevertheless, felt so injured
that he brought an action, and although he failed
to get a verdict it cost Moore and his publisher nearly
£6OO. The author explained that he had taken the
name Seymour from Seymour-street. Dickens more
than once had trouble in this respect. Leigh Hunt
was deeply offended by the portrayal of Harold Skim-
pole in “Bleak House,” and Dickens was practically
forced to apologise to him. In his preface to the
first edition of “Nicholas Nickleby,” too, he men-
tioned that he had reason to believe that a certain
person, who imagined himself to be the original of
Mr. Squeers, had consulted legal authorities on the
advisability of an action for libel. The complain-
ant’s opinion of himself was evidently not very
flattering.
“Caractacus”; A quaint custom has arisen in daily
paperdorn of giving the make of any car that gets
involved in a street accident. The formula runs
something like this: “John Jones, driving a Splodge
touring car, this morning collided with a two-seater
limousine Spruik.... A passing Chord had a narrow
escape. The Spruik was slightly damaged.”.... Cars
borrowed by thieves and joyriders are particularised
with the same care as those which run over precipices
or through shop windows. It may be that car
agents value this form of free publicity, but It must
be a form of boost which back-kicks occasionally.
Still, it is a custom full of possibilities for a booster
of initiative. Some day, instead of the chortle when
a motoring feat is performed in a Whiz car on
Gumdrop tires with Mussolini benzine, I am expect-
ing to read the proud slogan “Save Insurance by
Investing in the Smashproof So-and-so. It Always
Comes Off Best in a Collision—Send for our List of
Car Casualties.”
TO MY PEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s gold upon the hills to spend:
Come, let us gather while we may.
Too soon the bravest blossoms ’ end,
Too soon the little hours, old friend,
Unnoticed haste away.
The dead are knocking at the door,
The lonely dead that have no song;
The winds are singing down the shore,
And we must gird again for war
And go where we belong.
The gods have spilt their amber wine
To lave the waking skies above:
The conquered earth is yours and mine
To take and hold, and this the sign
We shall not want for love.
So up, and let us on, old friend !
A little wine to stain the mouth ;
A little golden coin to spend ;
A little war and love....and end
Our journey in the South.
By Southern hill and Southern wave,
By Southern rock and Southern tree,
Come, let us journey bold and brave,
And teach our hearts to fear no grave
That’s near a Southern eea.

ENGINES
For SERVICE and ECONOMY.
A Good Engine gives service and is serviceable by doing the work
claimed of it.
The “Lister” has a reputation of 58 years’ Machinery Manufacture
behind it
Economy.
The Lister consumes very small quantities of Petrol, and apart from
its actual value as a source of Power, the fact that it can be left running
for 24 hours or more without attention is a big asset in itself and speaks
volumes for the economy, reliability and consistency of the Engine.
IT OILS ITSELF.
The System of Lubrication fitted to the “Lister” is automatic. All
the bother of poking round with an oilcan o,r filling and regulating sight-
feed lubricators is done away with. All that is required is to fill the
reservoir (on the side of the crank case) and let the Engine do the
rest for the next couple of months or so.
This system does not use a
quarter of the oil necessary for
sight-feed lubricators, and, more-
over, it is obviously impossible to
under-lubricate or over-lubricate
while there is oil in the reservoir.

Of the two revues just loosed by Sydney’s
amusers, “Snap” at the Criterion calls for
the first attention of good Australians, for
the reason that its music was made by Ken-
neth Duflield, who learnt the principles of
harmony amongst his father’s sheep in S. Aus-
tralia. The melodies are slight but pleasing,
and the lyrics supplied by Dion Titheradge
are apt, although the sketches are not par-
ticularly bright, and the one entitled “The
Advertising Drama” has more pun in it than
fun. Still, there would be enough tasty
dishes even if this were omitted from the
menu. Hector St. Clair and Jack Cannot
help to serve sauce, and Edith Drayson (who
has some nice notes) and Reginald Dandy
embroider everything with music. Not so full-
blooded as a circus or a pantomime the show
is nevertheless good entertainment. Decima
and Eddie McLean do surprising gymnastics
with their limbs, and Yvonne Banvard per-
forms equally surprising athletics with her
voice. The infants who dance as penguins
deserve special notice.
The offering at Sydney G.0.H., “The
Music Box,” is a well-dressed revue which
opens with the menace of a plot, but speedily
relapses into a comfortable succession of
ballets, turns and sketches in which Harry
Angers and Dorothy Brunton divide the
honors. The latter is to be commended for
her brisk and sparrowlike proficiency in
picking out the edible bits of comedy hiding
in the bolster of nonsense; also for her
bright singing, clever dancing and general
lightsomeness. Harry Angers is somewhat
better than the ordinary farce-merchant,
and the farces provided are wittier than the
usual farce. “Words Mean Nothing” and
“Suspense Is Terrible” are in particular

Girls and trick-dancing are the principal
features of Sydney Tivoli’s current pro-
gramme. Maurice Diamond, the latest ex-
hibit in the eccentric-dancing department, is
helped by the toe-stepping of a captivating
sextette of local damsels, who have been
initiated into the complexities of the Charles-
ton dance —a potpourri of all the freak and
grotesque steps ever imagined. Helen Mc-
Mahon, Nola Reid and the Stroud Twins
lend shapely pairs of limbs; and there are
intervals of storytelling and catchy singing.

Frank Gorman is back again at Sydney
Fullers’, and with him Elsie. Sylvaney. The
pair play in a fair comedy-sketch called
“Photographed and Married.” and, if anything,
Gorman’s attractive singing voice has im-
proved. “The Lady Buccaneers” of GaleWyer’s
revue are a bright and harmonious pirate
crew, and the males of them pelt the audi-
ence with some lively tomfoolery. Florence
and Clifton risk their lives in gymnastic
stunts; Lawrence Halbert, a baritone of
serious mien, and Harold Walden, from
Yorkshire, are a pair of vocalists who score
with different methods: and tlie Super Six
Symphonists are still six, but have mislaid

If you yearn for excitement in your movie
entertainments you will get all you want
and perhaps a bit over at Sydney Hoyt’s,
where "Those Who Dare” are striking sun-
dry defiant attitudes and running their heads
into trouble. A few of the ingredients are
mutiny on the high sea, a fanatic who wor-
ships a snake, a young man addicted to
drugs, and a storm; and if you want more
than that you’re a glutton. “Cheap Kisses”
are to be had at the Lyceum, where obese
matrons are flocking to witness a sister-
sufferer perform youth-restoring exercises
to the strains of gramophone music. “New
Lives for Old” at the Empress should inter-
est returned Diggers, the scenes being set in
a little French farmhouse, with poplars for
a background; and Rudolph Valentino re-
mains the star at the Prince Edward.

Mummers, old and new, are combining to
make the testimonial to Walter Bentley
worthy of his stage-work in Australia. At
over 70 he is still teaching elocution, but
these days is a sick man; so old friends
tjeorge Portus, Norman Campbell and L. V.
Bartlett put the case to a large meeting at
the Australia one day last week. A theatri-
cal matinee will be the outcome, and already
offers of help are pouring in from the pro-
fession. Walter Bentley hails from Auck-
land, and it was there he made his stage
debut in 1873. He has been in casts with
Irving, Wyndham, Sothern and Benson, and
was the first Silver King who ever flashed
on America’s gaze.
The organ-like notes of Clara Butt have
been thrilling crowded houses at the Mel-
bourne Auditorium. There is no noticeable
deterioration in the great voice since Aus-
tralia last heard it; but the songstress seems
to be now rather weighted with a responsi-
bility to the Empire which her title has
put upon her. Nowhere is this more in
evidence than in the fervent singing of “God
Save” (Clara Butt, Kennerley Rumford and
the audience), with which demands for the
more that Melbourne always wants are
cut short. Yet even in such items as this
the lady is very well worth hearing. Otto-
rino Respighe’s “Nebbie” gave her a good
opportunity for finely dramatic work at'
her second concert, and in “Bella Porta di
Rubini” she was charmingly delicate. Rum-
ford's voice has lasted hardly as well as the
lady’s, but his vocalisation is well rounded,
and his diction delightfully clear; and he
gave a spice of enchantment to the singing
of Vaughan Williams’s “Silent Noon.”
Elgar’s “Land of Hope and Glory” and “The
Keys of Heaven” seem inevitable at these
concerts, and maintain a popularity which is
hardly deserved, comparing them with other
items on the programmes. Some bright
work on the piano is done by a self-pos-
sessed pianist, Marie Aussenac, who has a
fine technical equipment and considerable
verve, but is inclined to a tonal harshness.
Further concerts are billed for to-night
(Thursday) and Saturday.
* 51: * *
Maurice Moscovitch reintroduced “The
Outsider” to that portion of Melbourne which
made its way to the King’s Theatre on Satur-
day ; and, as usual, the audience expressed
its approval of the nasty remarks made about
the medical profession. Moscovitch repeated
his well-considered Ragatzy, and the cast
was much as before, with the substitution
of lan McLean for William Stack and Marie
Eaton for Rosslyn Vane. Jean Robertson
has succeeded in making herself slightly more
convincing as Lalage Sturdee, but Basil
Bowen is still an uninspiring lover —so unin-
spiring that he provides an almost suffi-
cient excuse for the otherwise unreal mar-
riage between Ragatzy and Lalage which has
been grafted on to the play to produce the
usual “happy ending.” How long “The Out-
sider” is to run is not definitely announced,
but it is for a short season only.
“The Silver King” revival is rejoicing
the box-office; and nightly at Melbourne
Royal audiences express approval of the
meaty lines of the good old drama.
ip sjc sjc
Another example of the profit accruing to
the revival of old plays of solid repu-
tation is provided at the New Palace (Mel-
bourne), where the success of “Charley’s
Aunt”’ lias induced the management to for-
sake its original intention of making weekly

changes. It has also induced a change of
policy: instead of the projected bellowdramas
there are to be more revivals, including “Are
You a Mason?” and "Our Boys.”
“Wildflower” continues to bloom sweetly
at Melbourne Majesty’s.
Cheerfulness and “No, No, Nanette” still
prevail at the New Princess. The bright
show is now in its 12th week.
V 'C ❖
At the Melbourne Athenaeum the Diggers
made a shuffle of their cards last Saturday,
introducing several new acts which go with
the same irresponsible gaiety as the old ones.
The concert of the Melbourne University
Symphony Orchestra provided a bright in-
terlude at the Auditorium. Under the train-
ing of Bernard Heinze, the orchestra is mak-
ing great strides, and it is obviously accumu-
lating friends—that was shown by the at-
tendance. Certainly there are weaknesses,
but on the whole the orchestra is now a
well-balanced organisation. The “Figaro”
overture and .Schubert’s “Unfinished Sym-
phony” were well conceived and executed;
other items included Dr. Whittaker’s “Dirge,”
Vaughan Williams’s overture “The Wasps,”
and Butterwortli’s “Shropshire Lad” —there
were inexcusable faults in the last, which
seemed to need more rehearsal. The play-
ing of the Saint Saens ’Cello Concerto by
Louis I-lattenbach was one of the evening’s
most applauded—and deservedly applauded
—items.
*❖ ❖ *
Planquette’s quaint “Rip Van Winkle”
was staged by the Victorian Opera Co. at
the Playhouse on Saturday night. The
performance showed considerable advance on
the co.’s “Maritana” of last year, the choruses
being particularly good, especially the
women, while the staging earned a word of
praise—the scenes on the Catskills, especi-
ally the Haunted Glen of Falling Waters,
were excellent. A little more light and shade
in the work of the orchestra would have
been an improvement. John D. Sullivan
was the Rip; he has a good voice, and used
intelligence, but his work was stiff. Out of
a comparatively small part Jack Bell (Peter
Van Derick) got much humor. Ida Roy
Ashton was, first, Gretchen (Rip’s wife) and,
in the last act, the couple’s daughter Alice;
she sang very nicely, though some of her
notes are a trifle hard. Dave Rose (Nick
Veddcr) and Romola Hanstein (Katrina)
were the most noticeable of the others. The
show is being continued throughout tnis
week.

Next Wednesday (30th) the Melba Con-
servatorium Society will stage
“Magic Flute” at the Albert-street premises*
—the first complete production in Australia.
Fritz Hart directs it.
Herschel Henlere continues to be u ' J , u '
success at Melbourne Tivoli; showing a bette
consideration for his audience than man}
vaudevillains, he made some changes in ins
act on Saturday. Milton Hayes is to nmsh
his season to-inorrow night, and the most
notable addition to the bill is Lee '* bite
and Sunny in an act that is certainly novel.
Cardini, the entertaining card-manipu-
lator who w r as last seen in Melbourne at the
Tivoli, has been added to the Bijou pro-
gramme. His turn is always amusing. The
Eleven Wonders include a couple of tiny
tots who do some really amazing tumbling,
dancing and acrobatic feats and gather a
tine harvest of applause.
There is good photography in “Love and
Glory” at Hoyt’s De Luxe, in. Melbourne;
and there is a' stirring story in it, too, start-
ing at the time of the Franco-Prussian \\ ar.
A supporting picture is “Alimony.” The
Majestic, where Stella Power now sings
during intervals, screens “The Parasite ——
the story of a divorced woman who tries to
win back her husband. Attractive Madge
Bellamy has the principal role.

Two Melbourne Art Shows; —
There is downrightness about the art of George
Bell, whose exhibition is at the New Gallery; he
presents his subjects with truth and simplicity.
“The Valley” (No. 8), a vividly composed land-
scape flecked with cloud shadows and brilliant sun-
shine, and “An Approaching Storm” (No. 14), are
particularly successful examples of his method. In
portraiture the artist has good work in paintings of
his wife and Miss Irene Vanbrugh. But the water-
color section is disappointing. The pictures are
lacking in substance; only in one or two is there
an approach to the merit which is indicated in
the oils.
The show of the Society of Twenty Painters, at
the Athenaeum Gallery, contains 152 offerings, mainly
disappointing. The exhibitors include George Col-
ville, all of whose seven are good; Carl Hampel, who
has put fine effects into a large canvas, “Morning
Sunlight in the Mallee” ; John Rowell; R. McCann,
whose “Winter Sunlight” (No. 100) and “A Tran-
quil Pool” (No. 98) are pleasant and convincing;
Jo. Sweatman; A. E. Newbury, who is best repre-
sented by “A Country Road” (No. 107) ; Miss
Bale and some others, of whom Clarice Beckett
deserves mention for conveying a real feeling of
dampness in “A Wet Road. Black Rock” (No. 21),
which makes the visitor regret that he has forgotten
his goloshes and umbrella. Miss Bale’s “Autumn”
(No. 13) represents her best work in landscape to
date. But it would have been a better show if
at least half the pictures had been left out.
❖ >!= :!: ;}:
Pictures in Adelaide are even more than
usually American. At the York Colleen
Moore attempts to show Josie Melville how
to play “Sally” with screen effects which
the stage could hardly run to. Wondergraph
has at last said good-bye to the “Ten Com-
mandments” after a record Adelaide run
for any kind of show, and is cheerful with

“Hamer": The most popular benefit
matinee of a half-century will be given
to Maggie Moore at Melbourne Majesty’s on
October 1. Maggie made her first appear-
ance in Australia at the Melbourne Royal
51 years ago—on August 1, 1874, to be exact.
No one in the thespian ranks has given the
public so much entertainment, and the lady
is as amiable in private as she is excellent
in her art. In a scene from “Struck Oil”
ancient John Forde is to appear with her
in his old part of Deacon Skinner. Maggie
Moore is going to relations in America later
on: but before she goes Sydney ought to
fall into line with Melbourne and give the
old stage favorite a benefit. Adelaide has
already taken preliminary steps.
“Hamfat”: Bob Greig, who has landed well
on his feet in New York, fostered a few
superstitions, his habit of “touching wood”
being one of them. He would touch wood
after merely remarking that he had enjoyed
his breakfast or had learnt a new part, and
he always made a point of sleeping in a
wooden bed so that lie could indulge in his
hobby with the least possible exertion. On
one occasion the; Greig flat was burgled, and
some £7O worth of jewellery stolen. A police-
man was brought in to investigate; and his
face lit up as he began to examine the dining-
room. “We’ll get our man in two-twos,” he
declared joyfully. “Why, look here, lie’s left
his finger-prints everywhere—right round the
edge of this table, for instance.” Greig’s
explanation tended to damp the Law’s ardor.
“C. Ockney”: “The Silver King” may look
“seedy to a modern audience,” as “L.E.”
(B. 17/9/’25) avers; but why is it “all non-
sense” to speak of the “wonderful” plays
written at the time when the good old “King”
was young? That Pinero and Jones wrote
wonderful plays is proved by the fact that
many of them have lived and have been
enjoyed by the critical theatre-going public
for over 40 years. “The Silver King” was
only one of a score of pieces from Henry
Arthur Jones’s pen that have been played to
enthusiastic audiences all over the world.
Pinero’s comedies likewise can still command
approval, aged though they are, because the
dramatist thoroughly knew his job. How
many of the flash works of nowaday authors
will last for 40 years?
“Verri”: Recent pars, about long waits
for theatrical performances recall that years
ago, when Savoy opera was most popular,
the isolated M.L. coastal town of Gisborne
was advised that a co. would drop in there
-and give a performance- of a Gilbert'and
Sullivan opera. The announcement caused
great local excitement, tickets were sold and
resold at increasing rates until some of the
far-back station folk paid almost fabulous
prices for their seats, and on the great night
the town was crowded with visitors. As the
weather was_ bad there was no alarm when
the steamer failed to appear on time; but as
the day wore on and there was no sign of
her it was realised that the performance
would not commence at the stated hour. The
audience nevertheless filled the hall, and
awaited developments. About 10 o’clock a
local concert party kindly began an enter-
tainment, and towards midnight supper was
handed round. A little later the hall was
cleared and a dance held, and then everybody
had a little nap. Towards morning hungry
people managed to secure further rations,
find after breakfast several parties w T ent pic-
nicking to the beach, keeping one eye on the
horizon for the steamer. But towards even-
ing their enthusiasm began to flag, and then
word came that somewhere in the early dawn
the ship had been compelled to pass the in-
hospitable roadstead by. It was some years
before Gisborne saw a G. and S. production.
Appropriately the opera that didn’t eventu-
ate was “Patience.”
“C.E.S.”: Apparently London likes its
plays short —sort of digestive tablets after a
SERVE HIM RIGHT.
THE MASTER: “Bit of luck, eh? Old Tight Mein has purchased that big oils of mine for
ninety pounds.”
THE MODEL: “ Goodo! The beastly old miser deserves to be swindled.”
late dinner. Harrison Owen says that of 60
plays produced in London in 18 months, 21
took less than two hours in playing. His
comedy, “The Gentleman in Waiting,”
played, with intervals, from eight to eleven
in the provinces. In London he cut it 15
minutes, but as some critics complained it
was still too long he hacked away another
15 minutes. Now that a further provincial
tour is to be made, he has been asked to put
back the “cuts.” The provinces he considers
the best money-makers for the playwright,
royalties returning a steady £l5 to over £5O
a week, the tour lasting at least ten weeks,
whereas a play which fails in the West End
may last only a week and return but a few
pounds. West End popularity, he tells the
Daily Mail, is “painfully fleeting,” whereas
in the provinces “audiences seem never to
tire of the plays they really like.”
“C.K.”’: A long course of Gilbert was not
conducive to success in any other channel.
The principal parts in the operas were gen-
orally recruited front the ranks-of the chorus,-
especially in the provinces; and as the tours
were practically unending and performers
could remain for years playing the same
parts, there could be no surprise if they be-
came mechanical. If a performer was trans-
lated into a different class of work where he
was dependent on his own ability—l am re-
ferring particularly to comedians—he was
often at a loss. Gilbert’s parts to a certain
extent play themselves, and the action being
fixed in the original production any intelli-
gent performer was almost certain of suc-
cess. There have, however, been cases in my
own experience in England and Australia
where the performers have not understood
the meaning of their lines. In one case a
Pooh Bah had to be superseded on this
account, and inability to speak blank verse
properly has spoiled more than one per-
formance of “Princess Ida.” Incidentally,
the finest Princess with whom I have been,
associated was a Belgian lady—Marguerite
Breydell. She had been a student at the
Comedic Franc-aise, but resigned because the
conditions were not such as she could accept.
She was a very fine artist, and I have often
wondered wliat became of her.
“Forebridge”: Commander 11. G. Stoker,
D. 5.0., RN. (retired), better known
on the London stage as Hew Gordon,
whose autobiographical “Straws in the
Wind” was lately reviewed on the
Red Page, was captain of the Aus-
tralian submarine AE2, and the first to prove
that the under-water passage of the Dar-
danelles was possible. Whilst waiting in
London for a command during the post-war
slump, Stoker, merely as an onlooker, at-
tended some rehearsals of “The Grain of
Mustard Seed,” which was being produced
by Norman McKinnel at the Ambassadors.
One day a man playing a small part sud-
denly gave it up. Someone looked down to
him in the stalls and called: “Here, just
come up and read this part, will you?”
And up he went. By the time the belated
naval appointment was received Stoker had
made good in his new profession ; and although
he was then nearly 40 years of age he elected
to remain on the stage. Hew Gordon is
not a second Garrick, but he is a very
competent actor, and until he played at the
Ambassadors he had only appeared in ama-
teur theatricals, and that very infrequently.
“Merino” (London) : Our old friends of a
"Night Out,” Madge Elliott and Cyril Rit
chords, are still pairing it, this time in a
London revue, “Bubbly,” which has reduced
visiting Australians to a spineless condition
of mirth.
“Minim”: The Williamson management is
preparing for another Australian season of
Gilbert and Sulli van operas, which are un-
failing box-office magnets here as in Britain.
Apropos, James M. Glover, for a score of
years conductor at Drury-lane, recently con-
tributed a quaint analysis of the audiences
attending the old pieces during a six-nights’
season at an English provincial town. He
discovered that 24 per cent, booked seats in
advance for the whole series (four operas)
presented; 15 per cent, came only one night
(“We like_ them all, but think this one the
best”) ; 25 per cent, were apparently over
50 years of age and brought children or
grandchildren. Ten per cent, admitted it was
the only visit they ever paid to a theatre.
The remainder was made up of what Glover
calls “the gramophone-pianola public.”
“C.K.”: In the beginning of 1898 a revival
of “Ruddigore” was under consideration at
the Savoy. It would have taken place, too,
had not Sullivan insisted that his work with
Pinero, “The Beauty Stone,” should have
precedence. When this opera “failed to
attract,” several performers desired by Gil-
bert for “Ruddigore” were unavailable, so
the idea was shelved. Gilbert told me—l
Avas to have been Dick Dauntless—that the
reason for “Ruddigore’s” comparative non
success was that the performers had become
so. accustomed to the suave Savoy method,
quite correct in previous operas, that they
could not adopt the broad melodramatic act-
ing essential to the proper performance of
“Ruddigore.” Gilbert intended his work to
be undiluted “penny-plain-twopence-colored"
melodrama, and only one member of the cast
—Jessie Bond as Mad Marg’ret—was able to
rise (or fall) to the occasion. This lady
much enhanced her reputation by this per-
formance. The “Ruddigore” music is Sulli-
van at his best, and it is a general hope that
the opera will be included in the forthcoming
Australian revivals. Should it be so it will
not be surprising if it equals, if it does not
exceed by reason of its novelty, the others
in popularity.
“Paree”: There is the usual talk this year
of a move to reform the minor stage of Paris.
Nothing at all above the Avaist is now a .
common feature in revue, and a string of
beads may do duty for the rest. , One item
that has been squashed met its fate through
the influence of A'isiting Americans. Ir
showed a procession of white women and
niggers, robed as nuns and monks; then the
robes were thrown off, and they danced be-
fore an altar. With all this goes, in strict
accordance with the history of decadence
in other nations, a taste for Sadistic cruelty.
A “torture garden” was a feature of one
revue, and the latest has a “roasting
chicken,” a nude girl, apparently spitted
through and revolving over realistic flames.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Joseph Jeffer-
son (B. 27/8/’25) made his first Australian
appearance at the old Princess’s Theatre
(the ramshackle edifice which opened as
Astlcy’s Amphitheatre in or about 1854) ir
Spring-street, Melbourne; part, Rip Van
Winkle; year, 1862; manager, George Faw-
cett, who in England added Roavc to his
name. In the following year George Coppin
built and opened the Haymarket in Bourke-
street East; he began Avitli “The Octoroon,"
Jefferson as Salem Scudder. The American
was good in all parts, and excellent in most.
I saAv his first appearance as Rip. and
admired him in many other plays. He was
a creditable Bob Acres and Graves
(“Money”), but those parts w 7 ere scarcely
in his line.
“Hot Pot”: The dignity of the touring
show has been asserted recently by one
manager. In a northern town it was the
uncleanliness of the loaa'u hall which was his
objection; lie had demanded that the
dressing-rooms should be sAvept, and, Avhen In
found them still in their state of dust, he
announced that the show would not open
that night. And having duly made the pro-
clamation that the incident was the fault
of the town clerk, he left that embarrassed
official to bear the indignation of people who
had travelled far to see the show that Avasn’t.
The kick in another toAvn was against the
people who think that a show will not start
until they are ready to attend. It Avas in a
township where the mail-train passes at
about 9 p.m.; and as slioavs didn’t usually
begin until that big attraction was over, the
crowd lingered in the streets. The manager,
standing in front of an empty hall, made
announcement that if the crowd didn’t start
to pour in he would close down. He was
as good as his word; and although a police-
man tracked him down later with the news
that a crowd Avas waiting outside the hall,
lie remained closed. Both dust and local
ideas about theatre hours are, it is true,
pests to the touring tliespiau; but, actors
being entitled to payment only for the days
they play, the co. may have its own ideas
about the manager’s dignified stand.

Add to the Joy of Motoring.
Westinghouse contributes to the joy of motoring by building
batteries which can be depended upon to render service at
all times. In line with the progress of modern motor engineer-
ing the magneto has been eliminated in some cars, leaving the
battery to supply the current for ignition. In such cars as
these Westinghouse reliability will be doubly appreciated.
When you need a new battery—
be sure you buy a Westinghouse.

through Blinding ‘Rains and
over Roads unfit for ‘Travel
Studebaker has again made motoring history!
“Across the Black Soil Plains” has gained a new significance since the epic dash of the Studebaker Special
Six Roadster from corner to corner of Queensland and back—a thousand miles of the journey through
torrential rains and over roads in the west that were often only seas of mud and bog.
When the car set out from Brisbane on August 28th last, many declared that the task set it impossible, even
under the best of conditions. But the Studebaker won through ! —and in the face of difficulties far greater
than could possibly have been imagined in advance.
As a test of endurance and reliability, the covering of the 2,978
miles in a total time of 11 If hours on the road is a feat un-
equalled in the annals of Australian motoring. Actual running
time was less than 105 hours.
This is easily the longest straight-out test ever accomplished
by any car in Australia, eclipsing even the previous record,
from Fremantle to Sydney, also held by Studebaker,
The test was not intended as a speed trial, but all along the
route the Studebaker smashed previous
through at times when scores of other cars were held up —
and accomplished the last dash of the outward journey, the
512 miles from Cloncurry to Burketown, at the almost un-
believable speed of over 52 miles an hour for the whole distance,
thus lowering the previous record for this section by more than
three hours.
Throughout the whole run not a single spare part was used.
Three thousand miles under such conditions of speed, roads
and weather are more than equal to several times the distance
under normal driving conditions. It is little wonder that in
1924 sales of Studebaker repair parts had dropped to £2/1/1
per car in operation.
All Studebaker cars possess the same reliability and stamina,
the same possibilities in power and speed—are built to give
the same trouble-free service as the standard model Studebaker
Special Six that accomplished this epoch-making feat.
All models are available from dealers in every state in the
Commonwealth.

OBJECTS.—The Company is being formed to carry on the, business of Garage
Proprietors, and for this purpose to acquire from 11. G. Clark his option over certain
property at Circular Quay, Sydney, and scheme prepared by him for conversion of exist-
ing building into a modern fire-proof garage capable of accommodating 930 motor-cars.
PREMISES.—The property is one of the best-known in Sydney, having for many
years been used as a wool store by Goldsbrough, Mort & Co., Ltd. It has a frontage
to Alfred Street of about 208 feet, by a depth of about 138 feet along Phillip Street, on
the one side and about 140 feet along Young Street on the other side to Goldsbrougn
j,ane at tlm rear*.
PURCHASE PRICE.—The purchase price is £lBO,OOO, payable as follows: (a)
A deposit of £25,000 (inclusive of option money) at the time of purchase.
(b) £70,000 by fourteen annual instalments of £5OOO each, the first to be paid
twelve months after date of purchase.
(c) £85,000 at the expiration of fifteen years from date of purchase. Ihe
balance for the time being owing is to carry interest at the rate of 6A per
annum, payable half yearly.
It is proposed to utilise exterior walls of existing building, which are very strongly
constructed, by reconstructing the interior with steel and reinforced concrete pillars and
floors, and by adding two stories to the height, making the structure ten stories high
altogether. Plans and specifications have been prepared by the Architects for this pur-
pose, which embody the very latest ideas in modern garage construction and equipment.
Due to its happy location, three of the nine floors for parking may be entered from
the street level, the upper floors being reached by inclined driveways or ramps, with easy
grades no greater than that of Martin Place, and wide enough to permit up and down
traffic simultaneously. Three passenger lifts and one car elevator will be installed.
SERVICE.—The premises will be open at all times, and motorists will be able to
drive in at any hour, day or night, and park their cars or obtain supplies of oils and
petrols. The present intention is that no mechanical repair work involving the
use of heavy machinery will be undertaken by the Company.
Water and compressed air Avill be available at convenient points on every floor.
A competent garage staff will be maintained, whilst capable chauffeurs will be
available for collecting and delivering customers’ cars at any point within the city at
reasonable charges.
SHOPS AND RESTAURANT.—The whole of the Young Street frontage and
part of the Alfred Street frontage will be converted into modern shops for leasing to
suitable tenants, whilst the top floor and the roof will be constructed as an up-to-date
Restaurant, commanding a magnificent view of the Harbor.
PARKING FACILITIES.—Parking space may be leased by the hour, day, week,
month or year, and exclusive use of the space chosen will be guaranteed 1 * Each car
will have a numbered stand separated from its neighbor by a concrete division. There
will be no overcrowding, and every car will he able to enter or leave without
disturbing any other car.
PROTECTION AGAINST FlRE.—Special attention has been paid to protection
against fire. The whole building will be protected by “Sprinklers,” whilst hydrants,
chemical extinguishers and sand-boxes will be installed throughout.
LOCATION.—The site chosen has the following advantages:—
(1) It is within easy distance of the centre of the city and most of the leading
stores, hotels and big office buildings where street congestion is greatest.
(2) When Martin Place has been extended to Macquarie Street and Elizabeth
Street carried through to meet Phillip Street it will be. still more accessible.
(3) It is on the way from the City to North Shore Vehicle Ferries, and when
the Harbor Bridge is opened it will be within easy distance of the bridge-head,
(4) It is right opposite all ferry wharves.
(5) Customers can park their cars and then proceed by short tram-ride to any
part of the city.
(6) When the Underground Railway is completed access will be given to all
parts of city and suburbs.
REVENUE. —Revenue will be derived from parking cars, rent of lockers, supplying
oil and petrol, washing, polishing and cleaning cars, charging and supplying batteries,
adjusting and relining brakes, fitting and supplying tyres and accessories, minor
mechanical and electrical repairs, collecting and delivering cars, shop, workshop and
restaurant rents.
It is not expected that clients will purchase all of their petrol and oil supplies from
the Company, but a reasonable proportion of this business will be sought for and
obtained.
PARKING CHARGES. —The parking charges will vary, and the estimated revenue
has been based on a minimum charge of 13s. per week per car, rising on a graduated
scale according to space required and location in the building. While the rates compare
favorably with those already prevailing in Sydney, they will also show a profitable return
to the Company.
Arrangements have been made to book up space while the alterations are being
carried out. Should any space remain unallotted, however, same will be available for
casual or transient parking, and in estimating the revenue due allowance has been made
for this. ....
ESTIMATED CAPITAL OUTLAY. —The total cost of the property—including
reconstruction and additions, and installation of service station equipment—is estimated
to be £322,075. of which amount £167,075 will be payable before the Company can
commence operations, the balance being on Mortgage.
To this must be added: —
Preliminary expenses, including Brokers’ Charges, Legal Expenses, Printing, Stamp
Duties, Advertising, Registration Fees and Sundries £0689.
£B5OO in cash and 8500 fully paid-up £1 shares in the Company are to be issued
to R. C. Clark or his nominees for promoting and organising the Company and to recoup
him for the purchase of the option over the property. Also all expenses (as per detailed
list available for inspection at the oflice of the Company’s Solicitor), including pre-
liminary expenses as set out above, incurred prior to registration, are to be paid for by
the During 1 12 months required for reconstruction, and until building becomes fully
revenue-producing, it is estimated that a total of £16,537 will be spent in making first
reduction of mortgage, paying interest on balance of purchase money and other sundry
expenses of conducting the Company. In accordance with usual practice, these amounts
will be capitalised, so that total amount of cash required to establish the Company, pay
deDOSit on purchase of the property, carry out alterations and additions ready to com-
mence business, is estimated at £204,801. The balance of the funds subscribed, namely,
£ll 699, will be employed as working capital.

PROFIT. —The estimates show a Surplus of Revenue over Expenditure of
£42,901, before making provision for Federal or State Income Taxes. On basis
of present incidence these taxes would amount to £7493, and af tor making
provision for this sum, the net earnings would then amount to £30,408.
This is sufficient to pay a DIVIDEND AT THE RATE OF 10 per cent
PER ANNUM on paid-up capital, and leave a BALANCE 04 £12,908 IOK
RESERVES. . .
It should be noted that interest payable on mortgage reduces by £3OO
every year, so that amount of net profit available will be increased accord-
ingly. When mortgage has been discharged, net earnings, before making pro-
vision for Income Taxes, WILL BE INCREASED TO £51,901, equal to
per cent, on paid-up Capital, .
TRAFFIC REGULATIONS. —Existing traffic regulations as regards parking cars
along streets are administered by the police in a very lenient manner because their rigid
enforcement at the present time would inflict a great deal of inconvenience and expense
to car owners, but it is not to be expected that this policy will always continue, as the
congestion in city streets is rapidly becoming more serious every day ; not only must
existing regulations be more strictly enforced, but it is certain that even more
stringent restrictions will be introduced in the near future.

DRAWING IS PROFITABLE
The Weston method of

is the most successful, be-
cause Mr. Weston teaches
his students to DRAW, not
to copy.
Many Weston pupils earn
money before they complete

the Weston School.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Norman D. R.: Somebody will be- sure to
want to Bay something to a later contributor who
carried the attack a bit further F.L.M.: Sorry,
but the stage has had more than its share of space
lately... .Walter G.: So much like so many dozen
other articles on the same stale old subjects....
“Specialist” is very thin gruel... .W.S E •
Too windy. Bulletin readers like their fare more
solid John W.: Couldn’t be done. Already we
don’t know where to put half the things we ought
to print.... Jetty Road: No, thanks; we’re not
giving employers as a class any three cheers. As
many of their troubles are due to their own or their
predecessors’ cupidity and stupidity as to the work-
men’s ignorance and gullibility... .John C.: Won’t
comfortably fit in anywhere A.F.M.; One is quite
usable ; the other is trite... .8.W.H.: Ingenious but
complicated; and Protection isn’t doing so badly,
after all. The number of Australian lines already
produced is in fact, rather astonishing Norwood :
'' ell, he showed up badly enough in that first
debate, anyhow.... Maolsa: What, has that ancient
swindle been practised again? G.C.L.: Too loose
and too long. .. .D.W.0.: “Jim” is built too much on
the pattern of too many other Jims. Edwin W.:
“Bugg” is not bright enough Hargo: Not enough
in the yarn L.S. (Manly): Not for us Donald
A.: The tale does not sound real....A.J. (Rand-
wick); Fails to reach anything of real interest
A.M.K.; No use for conventional novelettes of that
sort.... Dirk M.; “Tom” is a painful business that
hardly amounts to a story.. . .J.A.K.: Very dull
H.B. (Havelock North): Might have made a short
P ar R. Y.C.: Doesn’t get anywhere near....
A.T.D.; We don’t reprint; and your verse is only
for local consumption. Still, we have seen worse.
....Constance E.: Not a bad miss Butten D.:
Doesn’t get near.... Tarago: A war yarn at this
time of day wants more point and distinction....
J.C.G.; The man who preached moderation got drunk.
Well, we’ve known some people who preached pretty
drunkenly keep dead sober R.J.J.A.: No story
there. .. .M.H.H.: “Scott” is not at all convincing.
Alice J.: You make it very tedious G.M.S.:
Uses old properties in an unattractive way T.A.W.:
The yarn is not improved G. 0.5.: The matter is
commonplace and the writing poor Ewin W.:
“Dad” can’t be asked in Telopea Boy: The verse
is rugged and doesn’t say enough Nautex: Wild
melodrama C.C.H.: The material is good, but the
handling is not G.W. (Walkerville): The verse
must be a lot better and it is difficult to see how it
can be improved till you get a better grip of the
language Minnie C.: They are all a great deal
too crude.... F.S.H.: “The Lover” whirls on in a
giddy fashion: —
Subtly fragrant are her lips;
Warm her bosom where 1 ,o rest,
Caressed by satiny finger-tips
Of she whom I’ve been blest.
She is mistress of my all,
Loving, tender, eager and true;
But for her I surely fall
Back to the dust whence I grew.
She is Nature beautiful and bold,
Telling me this and teaching me all
Of those whom will hold
To the truth of the Call,
Are those whom God will enfold.
Then what is Nature?
Who but God
Watching his thoughts mature
Burst from the earthly sod.
. ...C.U.: Not for this sixpenn’orth... .S.H.P.s
Pretentious and rubbishy M.F. (South Yarra):
Not enough interest T.A.W.; The children’s verses
are not sufficiently remarkable, though interesting
to a point... .C.1.P.; Too much melodrama, too
little color and told by a bad method H.M.W.:
Misses.. ...C.E.T.: Same old dull idea handled a little
worse than usual Ethel B.: Those long-drawn-out
metaphors to describe commonplace things usually
appear in that sort of jog-trot verse—with an occa-
sional ugly limp William C.: The idea is weak
and the verse doesn’t help it F.C.M.: “Vindica-
tion” does not quite draw the weight H.8.T.:
No use to us T. 5.8.; Not bad verse in its way,
but it is a very mild way Airlie: Only says a
few commonplaces about a bit of landscape
V.H.T.: The article doesn’t appeal to us Dinkum
Oil; The metre rambles and shambles along in very
ungainly fashion... .Wanchai: It is only the beginning
of a yarn—. Harry P.: Well enough done, but
doesn’t suit a mixed audience—.T. Warra: “Spots”
is too ugly. We have declared a close season for
the ugly and sordid yarn; there’s plenty of that sort
in baud Rippurdea • Very vivid and realistic:—-
The ether is pulsst'...- . rtb ru indefir able horror!
Tlie clock strikes t.,c It is to-morrow.
The silence is si .tier by a sepulchral screech
Followed by a g.obeni:;, upernatural speech
Resembling a huskily Utter’d mutter.
As something down the stairs doth flutter.
A slithering skidding scratch and some sharp tape
Coming from nowhere as though, perhaps,
Report had been delayed years after impact.
Rare toenails smacked
’Gainst polished lino. A demented girl,
Laughing like the yell of a bagpipes’ skirl
Balances on one toe
Gyrates and pirouettes to and fro
On the top of the grandfather clock. Her throat
Is the plaguely pallor of a boiled artichoke.
She is a toothless shade; her face and feet
Are mottled like marble or potted-meat.
Each eye protrudes from its socket
And the mouth grins wide like a torn pocket.
....Rex B.; The sonnet gets very near... .E.C.8.:
“Spring is here so pretty” spoils it.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G. 8.: A hard try which missed the target...,
A.K.: A very cold dish. .. .G.T.: Some of us .deserve
the cataclysm Conan Doyle predicts J.P.: Super-
ficial slickness, shortweight drawing. ... H.W.T.: You
don’t improve worth tuppence... .W.A.H.: Shows
mild promise. G.T.: If you must undress a lady
why not choose one that’s worth it ?
“The Elder Son”: Touching Diggers who
went long stretches without leave (B.
3/9/'25). I sailed on the Argyllshire in
October, T 4, and was never away from my
unit for more than a few hours at night or
on Sundays until June, 1916, when I got my
first leave (10 days). I returned to France
to my unit, and in November, 1917, a 9.2
shell finished my soldiering and gave me a
passage to Australia. I never received any
sustenance money for leave due or leave
taken; and I have no doubt many other ex-
Diggers are equally entitled to a few pounds.


Clear Your Skin!
At this Season You Should Be on Your Guard
Against the First Signs of Skin Disorder.
PIMPLES, blotches, rashes, etc., as well as the more
painful and obstinate skin diseases like eczema, ulcers
and ringworm, usually originate in tiny inflamed spots
and eruptions. The simplest way to clear your skin of all
roughness and irritation, before it leads to nights and days of
fiery torture, is to anoint the parts with Zam-Buk three or
four times every day.
Zam-Buk is the one remedy you can rely upon to keep
your skin clear and healthy. This balm sinks into and purifies
the inner tissues and acts as a tonic for the sluggish skin.
Consequently Zam-Buk soon takes the fire out of a bad
place, it allays inflammation and swelling in its own irresist-
ible way, and after it has drawn out all impurities it helps
Nature to grow new, healthy skin.
Being free from animal fats and coarse mineral drugs,
which only clog the pores and retard healing, Zam-Buk has a
wholly beneficial effect on the skin. Get Zam-Buk to-day!
Use it for cuts, burns, scalds and abrasions, also for more
serious troubles like poisoned wounds, bad legs, piles, etc.

“Coppertop”: A good advertisement for
the Australian-made article. The Common-
wealth liner Fordsdale, which was built in
Sydney by Australian workmen, has created
two world’s records for trading vessels. The
first _was a run from Fremantle to Swansea
in 27 days; the second, a run from Alex-
andria to the same port in 8 days 8 hours.
Now, what about those destroyers?
* * * *. *. .
“Coppertop”: An idea worthy of adoption
throughout the Commonwealth has been car-
ried into effect in Sherwood, a suburb of
Brisbane. It is a Tree Museum. The local
council set aside a portion of parkland for
the purpose, and 100 children planted a
similar number of Queensland natives. At the
completion of the planting ceremony the stu-
dents signed a “Doomsday Book” and added
the name of the tree planted with its identi-
fication number. This record will be held
by the Forestry Association for future refer-
ence.
* * * #
“Stellsby”: Some people expressed sur-
prise when it was elicited in evidence before
the Deportation Board that several Italians
were employed on the Orama. It has been the
custom of the Orient Co. for many years to
sign on a number of Italian stewards in
Naples for the benefit of Italian immi-
grants. This practice of employing foreign-
ers for the benefit of foreign passengers is
followed by other British lines. The
R.M.S.P. liners, out of Southampton, and the
P.S.N. Co., out of Liverpool, sign on many
Spaniards and Portuguese; so does the
Nelson line, out of London. Their reward
comes in the big Portuguese and Spanish
passenger trade they have to and from South
American ports.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: A new and promising in-
dustry of Central Queensland is the quarry-
ing of lime carbonate, which is in brisk de-
mand as a fertiliser. Some sugar lands are
especially benefited by it, and in the Mackay
district alone over 2000 tons are used every
year. Fairly large deposits have been found
at Marmor and the Caves, near Rockhamp-
ton ; at the former there is a long seam a
chain wide and 30ft. deep, from which almost
pure lime carbonate is obtained. The
analyses vary from 97 p.c. pure to 85 p.c.,
and every bag supplied is guaranteed to con-
tain the latter percentage at least. The
present price is 30s. per ton f.0.r., but it will
be less when modern handling methods are
used.
“Ces” : A Melbourne firm has hit on a new
way of scaring off burglars. It advertised
in the press the other day as follows:
NOTICE TO BURGLARS.
The steel screens in side windows of 163 Collins-
street are charged with electricity each night, and
contact will be fatal.
T. Cooper asd Co., Furriers.
Coopers’ have been burgled four times, the
burglars just standing off, throwing a brick
through the plate-glass and helping them-
selves. As they can’t now get insurance
against burglary, and as the police seem more
interested in raiding Chow dens for fan-tan
players than in catching Bill Sikes, the old
farmers’ gag of “poison laid” seems to be
their only way out.
* * * *
“Clerk” : A special rail-limousine has been
built at the Newport (Vic.) shops to pro-
vide Railway Commissioner Molomby with a
speedy and comfortable means of getting in
touch with wheat farmers and discussing
their prospects and requirements before next
season’s crop is ready. The car is a Buick
model of the latest type, fitted with steel
flange wheels instead of ordinary tyres so
that it can run along the rails. A special
contrivance underneath enables it to be
easily removed from the line and turned
without the aid of a turn-table. With its
luxurious cushions and wealth of plate-
glass it isn’t much like the little trolley
which the elderly Miscamble used for much
the same purpose last year.

“Retsam”: “Aragun” (B. 20/8/’25) sets
up a wail against the State for discourage-
ment of the meat export trade and cites the
10s. inspection fee per head that Aberdeen
works have to pay to Newcastle abattoirs in
order to send meat to the Newcastle area.
The facts are these. The export trade is
admittedly dead, but the State is not to
blame. The breeding of cattle is at fault;
and also the feeding. A steer of two years
old in the Argentine, when dressed, will
weigh as much as a bullock herd of-five years
oldr Ergo, Argentine has three years’ start on
us. Furthermore, breeders here do not pay
enough attention to the quality of their
herd bulls. Any old thing does as long as
it can produce calves. The consequence is
that incest among cattle in Australia is rife.
As to the Newcastle abattoirs, they are not
under State control. The by-law imposing
10s. per head inspection fee for bodies of
beef imported to the Newcastle area was a
wise and far-seeing form of protection to the
local carcase butcher by the municipal coun-
cil. If bodies of beef were allowed into New-
castle free, the Aberdeen works would have
an advantage of 19s. 6d. per head for large
cattle, ss. per head for calves, 6s. per head
for swine, 2s. 6d. per head for sheep (the
inspection fees the tenants of the local abat-
toirs pay their Board), to say nothing of the
blood, paunches and contents of same which
the Newcastle Board takes from its tenants
without payment, and which F. J. Walker
and Co. (Aberdeen wmrks) can treat and sell
in the open market. “Aragun’s” remark
that F. J. Walker and Co. have “expensive
meatworks scattered around the country
lying idle” is bosh. Where are they? The
Sydney Meat Preserving Co., Ltd., is not
idle by a long shot, nor are the Gladstone
meatworks in Queensland. The operations
of the S.M.P. Co., Ltd., at Auburn, were
threshed out in Parliament in December,
1924, when the House rose in an uproar
against the undue advantages this co. enjoys
over the State abattoirs at Homebush Bay.
It is about time the Sydney Meat Board im-
posed large inspection fees on carcases not
killed at its abattoirs in order to protect its
own tenants. At present it is only 6d. per
head. The imposition would not increaso
the cost of meat to the public, because the
State abattoirs can supply all Sydney with-
out any outside help.

Girls! A Beautiful Skin
Is Your Greatest Charm
There is nothing more beautiful than a perfect skin, clear, soft
and healthy—that is the kind of skin that compels admiration. If
you have become discouraged of ever attaining a perfect complexion
and have used various creams and treatments and your skin is still
sallow, oily, coarse and blotchy, try Rexona Soap. You will be both
amazed and delighted to find what a difference this pure super-excellent
facial soap will make to your complexion. Doubtless it seems incredible
to you that anything so simple as bathing the face with Rexona
Soap and fresh water could make such an improvement in the skin
when so many other complexion treatments have failed to do so, yet
you will find that such is the case, because Rexona Soap contains, in
addition to its unusual cleansing qualities, all the soothing, healing,
corrective properties contained in Rexona, the Rapid Healer, so that
its use quickly overcomes any facial imperfections.
After using Rexona Soap you will feel that your skin has been
refreshed and invigorated to the very depths of its tiny pores, and you
will inhale the delightful outdoor freshness of the Rexona fragrance
that is typical of Rexona itself. Use Rexona Soap with hot or cold
water, hard or soft water. It is always good and gives abundant foamy
lather in every case. Use only Rexona Soap for Health and Beauty,
The Best Soap it is possible to produce.

N. Bogaduk; Vic., Durham Ox;

Sergeant-Major John George Willis, dead
at 71, was one of the grandfathers who
managed to evade the age regulations and
get into the A.l.F.ten years ago. He served
with the 4th Battalion of the Third Light
Horse. » His soldiering began in the Zulu
War of '79; it was continued in Egypt, on
the Indian frontier and in the Boer debate.
The most popular marrying age in South
Aus. is 28 for the male and 25 for the
female of the species. Last year there were
284 brides of 18 and five ’grooms of 17.
There were 38 men and 23 women of over
three-score years whp married, and 16 men
and 6 women over 70. Of 4i21 marriages
the Methodist Church celebrated 1279, the
Church of England came next with 1072.
Brisbane’s new Jewish minister, Nathan
Levine, who comes from Port Elizabeth
(S’Africa), was a chaplain during the war,
and is the fifth minister to the Chosen in
Australia who had tjiat sort of war service.
The others are Han glow and Rabbi J.
Brodie, of Melbourne; D. I. Freedman, of
Perth; and D. Hsrsch, of Adelaide. The
Rev. S. M. Solomon, of Melbourne —the only
Australian-born Jewish minister —also did
some padreing.
The Labor Club ,at Melbourne Uni., which
had its birth-notice in The Bulletin re-
cently, elected its executive the other day.
Lloyd Ross, son of R. S. Ross, the Red
Page journalist, is the presiding nurse, with
Mary Lazarus, 8.A., vice-president. W. M.
Ball, one of the brightest of the younger
members of the ’Varsity lecturing staff, is
secretary, and his offsider is the son of
philosopher-Prof. Gibson. An astonishing
number of young students have crowded into
the Labor group; the opposition show counts
only a handful of Liberals.
Australia has had several parsons who
came out of bank-managers’ chairs —one of
them, the Rev. J. G. Pitcher, of Adelaide,
had even been a general manager—but The
Bulletin knows only one who oscillated be-
tween the two jobs. This was Alfred Jolley,
general manager of the National Bank of
N.Z., who died the other day. Beginning his
working life in a bank in Melbourne, he
presently moved into the pulpit, but returned
to the overdrafts and the ledgers soon enough
to let him reach the top of his service. But
he never quite broke with the Methodist
pulpit, and made his hobbies of fishing and
preaching run in double harness to the end.
“Saign Please”: In Melbourne several
“emporiums” are installing special side-lines
to bring masculine custom. One firm has
gone so far as to make a billiard saloon a
feature of the premises. The idea is that
the men who now, on late shopping nights,
drape the kerb waiting for their wives, will
induce their spouses to shop where they can
say “When you’ve finished you’ll find me
in the billiard saloon.” And being lured
in—it may be only for a shave or a
haircut —of course they buy something. The
manager of a big mixed shop reckons that
over 33 per cent, of his customers now are
men; before the war they were less than 10
per cent.
“Hamer”: The death of Arthur W. Eales,
crack shot, recalls the fact that “the bygone
show station” of the Lower Hunter, which
was the property of his father, J. G. Eales,
was probably the finest single property in
the whole of Australia, including in its limits
Morpeth and. a lot of lush Hunter lands,
besides Duckenfield, where the family man-
sion was. But the old man spent much
money in keeping up his dignity and extend-
ing his estate: mortgages ran into six figures
when he died. It took careful nursing to
bring the estate out evenly; and when it
was cut up the boys—there were four of
them —got little more than the old Ducken-
field house and the home farm.
It was an odd coincidence that Melbourne
papers should be starring on the same day
two Rutherfords —one Ernest, the distin-
guished physicist, and the other Henry
Charles, a guest of the State at Pentridge,
who was privy to the digging of a tunnel by
fellow-worker William E. Dawson. Henry
Charles is quite satisfied that the essential
nature of the atomic structure of the terri-
tory beneath the looker in the storehouse in
which he was clerking was changed, but he
didn’t care a dash whether the beta or
gamma rays came out first from the nucleus.
All he is alleged to have seen was some atoms
sneaked out in a bucket beneath store-rub-
bish as often as warders’ lack of vigilance
permitted.
“Jog”: The train drew into a Queensland
station with excited passengers leaning out
of a carriage- window and shouting for a
doctor. Investigation showed a man on the
floor of the compartment writhing, and, appa-
rently, in the throes of acute appendicitis.
The ambulance arrived promptly, and the
sufferer was soon in the nearest doctor’s
surgery. The bearers who had brought him
there were amazed to see the doctor —a new
arrival in the town —seize the patient by the
back of the neck and plant on his pants a
hearty kick. But that was nothing to. their
astonishment when they saw the patient bolt
for the street and disappear round a corner.
“Struth,” said one of the ambulance-men,
“that was a pretty quick cure. How did
you do it?” The doctor laughed. “Oh. I’ve,
seen that chap before. That’s his method of
dodging railway fares.”

What makes motor car value?
9* Scientific research
IVIoST of the basic improvements
represented in the modern motor
vehicle have been due to the inventive
genius of a relatively few individuals
working practically alone.
A number of these pioneers in auto-
motive development have long been
associated with General Motors.
And, in addition, General Motors
has organized and coordinated their
efforts by providing a great Research
Laboratory, with a staff of engineers
and scientists drawn from all parts
of the world.
Thus has General Motors doubly
assured the scientific excellence of
its motor cars and trucks, and made
certain that the process of developing
automotive transportation will be con-
tinuous.

Billy the Dodger.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE’RE having a rough spin this
shearing on Gillawee, what with
th’ grass-seed an’ burr, an’ blow-
flies an’ wet sheep, so none of th’ mob’s
too lively after th’ fourth week, an’ only five
clear days’ shearing.
Th’ weather’s like it is back in the ’nine-
ties, raining nearly every day, an’ when it’s
fine th’ engine breaking down or th’ cook
getting too drunk to singe er bit er mutton.
Billy th’ Dodger an’ me is pen-mates, an’
we’re dossing in er lean-to on our pats back
of th’ salt house. He has th’ place all dolled
up like it was er bedroom at th’ Royal in
Condobolin—bits er shivery-grass in treacle-
tins like bokays, an’ white flour-bags full
er straw fer pillers. On the slab wall he
drives nails in ter hang our duds up, an’
he has stallion advertisements an’ er picture
of a bloke being hung tacked up near th’
winder. When I roars him up fer fussing
erbout th’ place, he says:
“Odds on the bodkins, varlet. You ain’t
made ter court er hammerous looking-glass,
or caper nimbly in er lady’s chamber, but
I”— An’. lie stops an’ glares at me like as
if he’s swailered er fly in his beer.
I can’t make Dodger out over the queer
way he’s always swearing since he drove
them actors erbout th’ Baekblocks for six
months. From what he says there must
have been a bloke with ’em be th’ name er
Shakspeare who was er champion swearer,
because Billy lobs back with er nosebag full
er fancy cussing, an’ he’s always trotting it
out. I asks him erbout this Shakspeare cove
once, an’ he says he writ plays an’ wasn’t
er bullock-driver. But then Dodger was
always a • leg-puller. Anyhow, whatever he
was he must er put er lot of action inter
his swearing if he’s th’ bloke Billy copied
from, fer th’ words always goes with wav-
ing arms an all sorts er twisting like er
bloke, caught in a barb-wire fence.
One morning it’s raining like blazes when
er young bloke trudges up ter th’ hut an’
chucks his bluey down inside th’ door, He’s
a good looker fer all he’s got er dial as
sad as er chap that’s just staggered out er
th’ dead house at er shanty. His clobber’s
like er suit that’s been dragged out of er
dingo trap. Th’ swag he flops is er poultice
er Murrumbidgee rugs, an’ his nosebag’s
the butt end of er cornsack.
“Is th’ boss here?” he asks, in er lar-de-
dar way. “I am seeking employment.”
“Once more under th’ britches,” Dodger
yells. None of us understands what he
means chucking off at the poor cow’s pants,
but I ups an’ says to th’ stranger:
“Don’t take no notice er Dodger’s chi-
aeking, he don’t mean nothing. If you wants
er job go ercross ter th’ shed an’ see th’
boss. We’re wanting rousers an’ he’ll put
you on.”
Er bit later th’ bloke mooches back an’
says he’s set fer th’ job. As th’ poor cow’s
as sodden as er last season’s scrub-turkey
nest, I chucks him th’ loan of er pair c'r
moles, er flannel an’ some boots. When he
begins to dry he mentions his name is
Clarence Attenborough, an’ says he’s snatched
his time at th’ Sydney University, where he
was going to be er barrister, so’s he can
follow the shearing. We can’t see why any
bloke wants ter chuck an easy lurk like
going ter school ter take on hard yakker,
an’ Dodger swears erbout it.
“Ter b or not ter b ,” that’s tlnr
question,” he says. Why he don’t say th’
b—’s right out is a bit of er puzzle, but I
suppose he wants ter kid lie’s shy using bad
language before er broken-down swell from
th’ University.
The next few days things is humming. We
gets er run (St- fine weather an’ th’ shearers
is making th’ most of it. There’s big tallies
.every day, an’ th’ rouseabouts is hopping like
bandicoots ter keep th’ board clear. But
Attenborough don’t seem ter fit in. He’s
like er parson what’s wandered into er two-
up ring an’ can’t get away. Not that he
squibs on his job at all. He bucks in with
th’ best an’ does xnore’n his share, but at
smoke-oh he wanders off be himself like er
pleuroed bullock, an’ he’s always rubbing his
forehead as if he’s got a skinful th’ night
before.
Dodger takes er terrible fancy to him,
though,, an’ kids'him ter shift his traps into
th’ leah-to with us. The first night th’ pair
of ’em gets on my nerves. You can imagine
how I’m knocked when I finds that the lah-
di-dar bloke’s er pal this Shakspeare wot
Billy drove round with th’ actors, an’ he’s
learned more of his coarse talk than Dodger.
The two of ’em gets at it, chucking cusses at
each other fer hours, an’ me not understand-
ing only er bit of it here an’ there.
Once Attenborough comes in an’ calls
Billy er Roman, an’ asks him fer er loan of
his ears. Now Dodger’s er Methodist, an’ er
touchy one at that. Does he lob one on
Clarence’s jaw? Not him! He sniggers
and says something erbout laying on Mafc's
duff. Old Mclntyre, the cook, is pretty
rotten.
Another time when th’ three of us is smok-
ing quiet in our bunks th’ dude starts.
“Trouble, trouble, froth an’ bubble,” he
says.
“My oath,” I says, “you hit it. That’s th’
flaming trouble at every shanty yer strike.
All froth and bubble, an’ not enough beer.”
Him an’ Dodger laughs like anything.
“I ain’t referring to beer,” he says at last.
“Well, what are yer saying?” I asks.
“Oh!” the barmy coot says. “It’s th’
which’s chorus.”
“Which song is it the chorus of?” I wants
ter know.
“It isn’t er song,” he yaps back, laughing
again. An’ Dodger puts in his mag.
“Er lass, poor Yorrick!” says he.
That shows me Dodger’s got a tick. Yor-
rick's a moke I’m training fer th’ shearers’
races at Euabalong. He’s a ehes’nut geld-
ing by ol’ Burcher’s Hamlet, out er Ophelia,
an’ he has that name when I gets him; so
when er bush bloke like Billy gets that boxed
he can’t tell er horse from er mare, an’ then
calls er horse er lass, like it was er tart,
it’s time ter shift. After that I travels inter
th’ hut with th’ mob an’ leaves ’em to it.
Erbout three weeks after this we’re just
bogging in one day ter whitewash th’ lambs.
Th’ engine’s purring like er tomcat, an’ us
shearers is snapping ’em out er tli’ pens
like er board full er ringers. The rousers is
taking things easy, just swinging tli’ brooms
like they was chasing blowflies off the meat.
Attenborough’s clearing th’ tips from round
me feet, when suddenly he drops his sweeper
an’ says “My Gord!”
I looks up an’ gets a shock when I sees
three tarts mooching down th’ board with ol’
Brady, th’ owner of the run, an’ him point-
ing out th’ whole business to ’em. I swears
to meself because I’ve forgot to patch that
hole in th’ seat er me pants,, but I thinks
quick an’ backs ergainst th’ pen, squeezing
th’ lamb er bit so he’ll buck erbout ter cover
me retreat.
But Attenborough stands there looking like
er bloke that’s been caught by his mates
having er Jimmy Woodser. All he does is
ter say “My Gord!” over an’ over again.
One little tart works out er th’ mob an’
pokes over towards us. I sees her prop, an’
take er good screw at Attenborough.
“Clarence!” I heard her say, like as if
she’s terrible cut up erbout something.
But th’ dude kids he don’t hear. He
stares at her in that same way th’ tart
looked at me when I butts inter th’ Masons’
dance at Condo, in me moles an’ tries ter
hook her fer er twirl. This piece don’t look
stand-offish, though. It seems ter me she’s
giving Attenborough th’ office ter duke her.
But th’ silly coot turns his back on her an’
ambles over ter th’ wool-tables.
Tli’ tart stands. staring after him. I sees
her face go white as a clean shirt, an’ her
fists shut as if she’s going ter punch some-
body. Then big tears begin ter dribble down
her dial, an’ she lets ’em drip until th’ others
coo-ee fer her ter come. She uses er little
bit er rag, erbout big enough to cover the
bottom of er jackshay, ter wipe her eyes an’
ducks after her mates. When Attenborough
comes back ter my stand he’s as white in
the gills as tli’ tart was.
“Seen th’ ghost er th’ stockman at th’
haunted hut?” I asks. But he don’t take
it as er joke. Instead, he gets shaky in tli’
hocks, staggers ter th’ gate er th’ pen and
grabs it, as if he’s goin’ ter fall. Then he
mumbles something.
I don’t understand what he’s drivin’ at,
but Dodger seems ter know. He jambs off
his machine, boots th’ lamb he’s clippin’
down the shoot, and grabs Attenborough by
th’ arm.
“This did I fear,” says Dodger, an’ his
voice is like as if he’s crying drunk. Then
he lugs th’ dude out th’ back er th’ shed, an’
I don’t see either of ’em until after scran.
I’m playin’ euchre with old Ready-made
Jack erbout 8 er’clock when Dodger pokes
his head in th’ hut.
“Sliprail,” he says, “I want yer!”
I chucks down th’ broads an’ mooches out.
Then he lugs me ter th’ lean-to. Attenbor-
ough’s squatting on one er th’ bunks, his
nut in his paws, like er bloke with er head
on him. He only groans when we comes in.
Billy leads me out near tli’ loading-stage.
“Look it here,” he says. “Things is crook
with Romeo,” and Dodger springs er yarn
erbout Attenborough an’ th’ tart that worded
him on th’ board being sweethearts down in
Sdney. Her ol’ man’s got no time fer
irence, an’ tells him off pretty solid. But
Clarence’s ol’ woman, who’s some sort er
silvertail, thinks th’ tart ain’t toff enough
fer her son, an’ she takes er hand. She cuts
th’ tart out of er mob at some tony dance,
an’ tells her off too, chucking up something
erbout er ol’ gran’mother keeping a shanty
out on Lambing Flat in th’ gold days. Of
course, th’ girl tells her father (she ain’t
-got no mother), an’ he goes looking fer Clar-
ence’s ma (he ain’t got no ol’ man). Then
th’ fun starts. There’s er lot er barneying,
an’ in th’ middle of it th’ colt an’ th’ filly
bumps in. Of course they takes sides, an’

in tli’ stampede they cusses each other an’
swears they’re cut out fer good.
There don’t seem nothing wrong erbout
this, an’ I tells Dodger it ain’t nothing to
do with us. But I asks him why Atten-
borough’s off-siding in er shearin’-shed when
his old woman’s up ter dough.
Dodger explains that Clarence is shook on
tli’ piece all tli’ time, though lie’s told her
off. After th’ bang-tail muster they’d put
through lie roars his old woman up, renigs
on th’ dough she tosses him. chucks in th’
barrister business at th’ University, an’
lights out fer th’ plains.
“An’ look it here,” says Billy at the finish.
“Tli’ tart’s still shook on him too, and me
an’ you is goin’ ter unite them liammerous
swines.”
I agrees th’ pair of ’em is silly swines,
but Dodger’s worked up, an’ that’s w T hy he
uses that other queer swear-word.
“What job have I got in tli’ muster?” I
asks.
“You’re the only bloke at th’ shed with
a clean shirt,” says Dodger, “an’ you’ve goi-
ter go over ter th’ homestead an’ ask fer
Miss Carstairs. That’s tli’ tart. Tell her
Clarence is took sick an’ wants ter see her
before he pegs. She’ll come at full gallop
if I’m er judge, so steer her fer this joint.”
This ain’t no good ter Gundy; an’ I argues
with him. But Dodger’s a stubborn bloke
at times, an’ he kids me into it at tli’ death.
Attenborough’s still groaning when I passes
th’ door fer th’ clean shirt. As I'm putting
on th’ Prince Alberts I borrows from th’
slushy, I sees Dodger chucking his saddle
on ol’ Yorrick.
“Where yer off ter?” I yells.
“Ercross ter th’ overseer’s cottage,” he
answers. “There’s er parson there.” And
he rams home th’ bleeders an’ off.
It’s erbout er mile ter th’ homestead, an’
I mooches pretty slow because I don’t like
messing erbout these here love affairs since
I got shikkered at Alt' Carey’s funeral an
got run in. It’s near 10 er clock when I
musters up enough courage ter word one of
th’ housemaids who’s in th’ kitchen ter tell
Miss Carstairs I wants her important.
She comes out in er few minutes. She’s
togged up like as if she’s at er swell hop,
with one er them frilly dresses on that shows
plenty er wither.
“What do j’ou w 7 ant?” she asks me, in er
soft voice like them flash barmaids in Forbes
uses.
“There’s er bloke be tli’ name of Atten-
borough down at th’ shed,” 1 says, “lie’s
pretty crook, an’ says he wmnts ter see yer
before he snuffs.”
What I tells her must have give her er
terrible shock. She gets white an’ starts ter
shiver. I reckon I ought ter comfort her
er bit. “Hold hard,” I says, “th’ coot ain’t
pegged yet. He’ll hang on fer an’ hour
or so.”
It bucks ’er up, an’ she clutches me arm.
“Is he calling fer me?” she says in er
hoarse whisper.
“He’s been coo-eeing for yer since he took
bad,” I lies, “an’ he wants yer ter hurry
before it’s too late.”
With that she shoots out th’ door towards
th’ gate.
“Come,” she says, “every moment is pre-
cious. Oh, my poor Clarence!”
As we’re stumbling ercross th’ horse-pad-
dock she asks me what’s w rong. I’m er bit
staggered, because I ain’t thought up any
counter fer er question like this. But I
thinks quick and tells ’er.
“He’s got th’ gripes,” I says, “an’ terrible
bad.
“Oh, how awful!” she moans, an’ stumbles
so she nearly goes over.
When we’re erbout er hundred yards from
th’ liut I hears galloping hoofs erlong th'
track. I can just spot two blokes ride up
ter tli’ back er tli’ yards. I tips it’s Dodger
an’ th’ parson.
“It’s the doctor,” I tells the girl, an’ she
starts into er canter.
I works her up ter th’ door of tli’ lean-
to, an’ shoves her in. Attenborough’s still
squatting on th’ bunk, his mudhooks over
his dial an’ groaning like as if ’e did ’ave
the gripes.
“Oh,- Clarence, my poor darling!” th’ tart
squeaks.
As I mooches off I get er squint at Atten-
borough in holts with her, an’ th’ pair of ’em
kissing er treat. In er minute or two erlong
comes Dodger with th’ parson bloke. He’s
one er tli’ Bush Brothers wliat travels th’
shearing. Then th’ three of us butts into
th’ doss.
Both Clarence an’ th’ girl’s hanging on
ter each other. They grins silly-like at us
fer a while. Then Clarence steps out.
“All yet seems well, an’ if tli’ end be
sweet,” he says, “the bitter past, more wel-
come is th’ sweet.”
Dodger an’ th’ Bush Brother tumbles to
w T hat he means, an’ they moves up an’ dukes
both of ’em.
“Now,” says Billy, “here’s er cow-old
monk what’s ready for his job. Let him
unite both Romeo and Julio.”
The pair of ’em get er bit of er shock at
this, ’specially tli’ tart, who I reckon don’t
like Dodger mentioning her front name, an’
’im a stranger. But Attenborough looks
at tli’ girl an’ she looks up at ’im.
“Will yer?” he says.
I don’t hear what she answers, because
Dodger chips in.
“My oath, she will,” he yells.
Then th’ parson sticks on a shirt affair
over his clobber, lugs a book out of his pants
pockets an’ begins ter read tli’ hitching ser-
vice. Th’ show gets held up er bit when
they wants er ring. I hops round ter th’
hut an’ borrows one er them rheumatic-rings
from Bulbodney Bob, an’ gives th’ boys th’
office erbout tli’ performance.
It’s tli’ fair dinkumest wedding I ever
seen. There’s Attenborough, togged out iu
tli’ pants an’ flannel I lent* ’im weeks before,
all greasy an torn, an’ is’ toes stickin’ out
of an’ oi’ pair er bluchers he’s boned from
Dodger. The tart’s er regular toff, standin’
up proud alongside him in ’er fancy dancing
clobber, an’ better-lookin’ than some of them
pieces wot serve in th’ big stores in Dubbo.
An’ standing on th’ bunks an’ pushing in
at th’ door is th’ mob from th’ hut, all solemn
as blokes when er dead nark’s won th’ bob-
in.
When th’ business finishes, an’ me an’
Dodger sticks our monikers on th’ way-
bill what tk’ parson fixes ter show they’re
yoked up, ol’ Mclntyre th’ cook pushes in,
belting er big damper-tin with er tommy-
hawk-handle.
“There’s refreshments fer th’ bride an’
th’ wedding guests,” he says. “Come erlong
ter tli’ kitchen.”
We all crowds in, an ol’ Mac has th’ table
rigged up like at er first-class pub. There’s
sheets er newspaper fer tablecloths, bits er
grass an’ burrs in tins, clean pannikins, two
china plates, an’ in th’ middle er big brownie
with words writ on it in icing-sugar. I
reads it an’ it says, “God rest his soul.”
It’s a wonder how the old poisoner fixed
it up so quick. It’s bosker all right, an’ th’
bride says it’s er lovely wedding-cake, an’
tries ter kiss ol’ Mac. He scoots like e’r
dingo before she gets him, though.
We’re in th’ middle er th’ speeches when
who should lob in but ol’ Brady an’ th’ rest
of th’ tarts from th’ homestead. They’re
knocked bandy. Dodger takes th’ boss er
one side an’ gives him th’ straight wire. But
he’s got er dazed look that don’t wear off,
even when we gives three cheers an’ a tiger,
an’ Clarence takes ’is wife off up ter th’
homestead. As he disappears in th’ horse-
paddock Dodger yells out:
“Bass-arnyer, fare yer well!”
I gives ’im one on th’ jaw for swearin’ at
such er time. An’ Attenborough shows he’s
narked too. He sings out: “Antoneo, I’m
spliced to er tart who’s dear ter me as life
itself.”
Why he calls Dodger er Dago name I can’t
make out, though. Probably ter show his
contempt.
We don’t see no more er th’ married couple.
They ducks next day for th’ railway, ol’
Brady driving ’em ter Condobolin in ’is ear.
Er week later we hears from Clarence.
He writes ter Dodger an’ tells ’im they’s
fixed it up with their old people, an’ they
got their travelling statement an’ permit fer
th’ stock-route er life.
But at th’ cut-out We has er real surprise
party. As we’re hanging erbout fer our
cheques, up lobs er big motor-car ter th’
shed. She pulls up, an’ out steps Atten-
borough an’ his missus. They dukes us all
round, an’ then they produces er lot er stuff
from th’ back. There’s champagne, an’ hard-
tack, an’ bottled beer —no doctored grog
either. An’ th’ missus hands out er cake as
big as er cattle pumpkin all covered with
icing an’ white horseshoes an’ lolly angels.
Ivewpics, Dodger says, being th’ god er love.
Well, we’re just drinking th’ tenth toast
when up comes another car. Th’ chap driv-
ing it has er policeman’s cap, but in tli’ back
is an ol’ bloke an’ an ol’ piece. They’re
both grinning as if they’d drawn er horse in
Tatt.’s. I tips ’em at once as tli’ ol’ people
belonging ter Attenborough an’ his missus.
Th’ ol’ chap hops out an’ lifts th’ ol’
girl like she’s as valuable as er stud ewe.
Then they both walks over ter th’ young
couple.
“Well,” chirrups th’ ol’ cove, “if there’s
anything left in th’ bottles th’ men an’ you
an’ Doris (I suppose he means Julio) can
drink tli’ toast of me and me bride. Gillawee’s
a good place fer w r eddings, an’ me an’ yer
mother was married in Bogan Gate this
morning.”
Well, I don’t think w T e stops cheering fer
an hour. Th’ married couples dukes th’ lot
of us eround erbout six times, an’ then they
lights out, leaving us all th’ grog an’ th’ big
cake. We has th’ time of our lives. An’ I
reckon th’ ol’ pair getting spliced on the top
of th’ other wedding’s tli’ funniest thing I
ever see since Up-she-rises fell off Jack
Buckley’s coach at Lake Cargellieo an’ broke
his leg.

Pear Blossom.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rfl HICK on the bought white wings
unfurl;
The air is feathered with flakes of
peai'l.
“Lady, lady, whose sad robes pass .
Like a soft rebuke on the laughing grass,
As you fill your hands with the pear-tree’s
spray,
Dawned there ever a lovelier day?
And of all things kissed by the early air,
Lady, you are the fairest fair!
The sunbeams chuckle, a thrush flutes free:
Come down the happy road with me!”
“Hush your meaningless words,” she said;
“In a dark room my love lies dead.”
Over the breast of her mournful gown
Dew and petals and tears rained down;
She piled her arms with a snow of bloom
And bore it in to the shuttered gloom.
Slowly along the hall she passed
With feet unwilling. The flowers massed
About her, she sank on the heedless floor
And pressed her palms on a dreadful door.
She leaned to the fresh white blossoms’
breath,
Then shuddered back, for they smelt of death.
The cedar panels were thick between,
Yet ever she saw what her eyes had seen:
His mouth closed always to joy or care,
And the frigid pathos graven there—
Cold, cold; and even more white
Than blooms that breathe like a graveyard
night—-
A sheet drawn over his stony brow
And the hands that never would hold her
now.
At the end of the hall the thrush sings bold
Through the open door in an arch of gold.
“Always you followed,” she whispering said,
“Though long from your faithful arms I lied,
Till in the end (ah, Sweet-at-last!)
My lips met yours and clung, clung fast.
Now life like a tiger holds me here,
And I cannot come to your call, my dear!
How could you leave me” —low her moan—
“ln the black and pitiless world alone?”
Out in the sun white buds uncurl;
The air is warbling in notes of pearl.
