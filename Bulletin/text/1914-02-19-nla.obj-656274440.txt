■HOW TO USE THE POWDER. 1

Si
The Red Page
A. Gore-Jones deliberately forfeits the prize
that should have been hers by departing from
the rime-scheme expressly laid down as neces-
sary in these competitions. She uses four
rimes, instead of two, in her octette; and
the finest sonnet in this month’s competition
, is therefore reluctantly laid aside: —
The shining seas are sivept with beryl green.
The purple hills stand clothed in milky
haze,
While on their timbered flanks great bush-
fires blaze.
The sun, each eve, a scarlet globe is seen,
As daylight's blinding hues of white and blue
Give place to tearless splendors of the
night;
Where brazen stars burn insolently bright,
And shrill mosquitoes chorus the hours
through.
Oh. golden morning month of heat and sun!
With eager lips yon bruise the fragile face
Of fading green on sloping hill and plain.
And as their fervid course your moments run,
The dumb earth, swooning 'neath your
fierce embrace,
Dreams pantingly of February's rain.
A. Gore-Jones.
Of the three remaining sonnets, two are
elaborate allegories, but in neither case is
the allegory sufficiently identified with Aus-
tralia. Either might as easily an ply to any
hot place anywhere, including Ilades. Yet
Nina Murdoch —a name honorably familiar
in these competitions—does draw a fine pic-
ture of heat: —
Her tyrant lord, the Summer, bids her bear
Twain of his lusty children thro' the heat,
And as she creeps along with listless feet
And eyes half-blinded by the noon-day glare,
The moisture of her temples makes her hair
Oling to her brow in little tendrils meet
For ■kisses, while her languid pulses beat
Ever more faint upon the swooning air.
For this, with sudden tenderness, her lord
Holds her within his arms the whole night
through,
Charming her sleep with amorous ivhispers
borne
On scented breezes. Yet ere day has scored
The East with flam<f, he bids her rise anew
Panting beneath her load to face the morn.
Nina Murdoch.
Herbert Tracey’s allegory is new and strik-
ing, and, with the exception of his fifth line,
where the word “grand” is too obviously
thrown in for the sake of the rime, he
carries his imagery bravely through:—
Proud Summer stood, a dice-box in her hand,
Put yestere’eh beneath the moon's pale glow,
Whilst we, impatient, waited for the throw
That should decide the fortunes of our band.
Then straightforth she, the gambler, reckless,
grand,
Cast out the Dice upon the Plains of Woe,
And, as we watched, amid vague wliisp’rings
low,
Behold! A new year broke upon the land.
And, when, amid the dried grass where it
fell,
We saw the six-spot upmost on the Dice,
All knetv that Summer's toll would not yet
end;
But that, relentless, she would wring her
price
From sun-dried crops, till weary men should
bend
And pay full tribute to this Bride of Hell.
Herbert Tracey.
The winner, who must thank Miss A.
Gore-Jones for his position, is C. E. Moore,
Coan Downs. Mount Hope, N.S.W., whose
sonnet, inferior in originality to either of
the latter entries, more admirably suggests
our Australian January. The obvious de-
fect is the unnecessary intrusion of July
and the too-strained metre of the line in
which July occurs. Much may, however, be
forgiven the winner for his sestette.
J. Inches Thomson’s 7 Voyages and Wan-
derings in Far O* Seas and Lands (Headley,
per N.S.W. Bookstall Cos.) deals plainly
with the author’s early experiences in M.L.
and the Pacific. A matter-of-fact narration
of exciting adventures.
Part 9 of the second volume of J. H. Maiden’s A
Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus (2s. 6d.),
and the second part of Vol. 6 of the same author's
The Forest Flora of N.S.W., illustrated with plates
and photographs of the trees mentioned, show the
progress towards completion of two valuable scien-
tific works.
January.
The poetic quality of the 33 entries for
the best sonnet on our January is
distinctly higher than that of those
submitted for the December competi-
tion. Technically, too, the sonnets are
better, though “Nairda” supplied a
IG-line attempt. Good sonnets were sub-
mitted by D.H.B., It. G. Henderson, Stuart
Mack, G.B.D., Mabel Nagle, W.L.D., B.C.
Marriott Watson —a consistent competitor,
T. V. Tierney, Ben Sun —whose otherwise
fine sonnet was spoiled by a four-foot line,
and M. W. L. Roper.
Mick Much, as usual, provides the comic
relief; but this time his sonnet is so Austra-
lian and so picturesque that he narrowly*
escaped winning the prize. It is not the in-
tention of the adjudicator to bar the Aus-
tralian language from an Australian sonnet;
but his entry is too local and too personal to
be a prize-winner. In this sonnet-sequence
there should be a largeness of reference suit-
able to the largeness of this continent: the
conditions noted should be, as far as pos-
sible, the conditions that would apoly
throughout the Commonwealth.
If I cud set me peepers on the coot
Thet wants a sonnit on this weather writ
I’d put it to ’im: “’Ow’d he fancy it
Fer yakkerin’ on a thresher ’Twould be beaut
Ter ’ave the cow w'ere he mus’ foller suit
En ’eave the straw—-he’d ’ave ter do ’is bit
Er else git swaller’d in a smotherin’ pit
As hot as ’ell is at the flamin’ root.
Thet’s me this month; I’m racin’ in the heat.
In dust en rust.en’ sweat near choked en’ blind,
Wile bags er gettin’ bulged wi’ golden wheat,
En’ tossin’ empty straw in tons behind.
If there was January sonnits neat
This ’ell’s machine ’ud thresh ’em frum the mind.
Mick. Much.
Another humorous and personal sonnet, a
second entry from Ben Sun, is allowed quo-
tation :—
Hail! January, natal month, all hail!
You lop a chunk of summer off for me,
For I set out upon my birthday spree,
And I’ll care not for blistering heat or gale
The while 1 revel in the good brown ale,
Or gin or whisky, as the ease may be —
My oath ! the time will go right rapidly,
And though the fiftieth it will not stale.
And though I’ll suffer when you’re dead and gone,
And see quaint tinted snakes with flaming tongues,
Uncelebrated you won’t pass me by.
It was your sun that first upon me shone ;
It was your breath first filled my infant lungs—•
Mayhap that’s why my throat is always dry.
Bun Sun.
The vagueness of the sestette, weakened,
too, by a trochaic line, upsets this excellent
beginning by Mary A. K. Robb :—
-No Ice King holds our sunny land in dread:
-Her happy children play upon the sand,
Or hie them out in woods in merry band;
And if, in fear, ong turn a startled head,
It is, lest he, the Sun God, fierce and red,
Lift up his firebrand in his cruel hand
And burn the sun-kissed verdure of our land.
’Tis thus his fickle humor, grim, is fed.
Allen Farroll, too, fails to fulfil the pro-
mise of his youth, though even that is marred
by the rimes to the third and the sixth line:
The white sand hillocks drown in quivering, heat,
The emerald sea ’s a-dream and satin white
About the thin black reefs. All day the light
Pours in a sapphire passion, till the sweet,
Warm dusk of night comes by on jewelled feet.
Again the Summer feeds his grown delight
While golden daylight mellows into night,
And Time's white starry pulses slowly beat.
Duncan Brown, who has sent in some
good sonnets, submits an octette which con-
sists of clauses tacked ramblingly on with
links like “how soon. .. .when. . . .which....
that. .. .until”—a cumbrous construction.
But in his end he, in more business-like
phrases, says a word for the kiddies:—
And while, beneath the ardent summer sky,
All nature shrinks and quivers visibly,
From sea and hill there comes in shouts the good'
Glad laughter of the children freed from tie
Of school; and in their lusty ecstasy
Is heard the strong note of our nationhood.
The winner of the December sonnet com-
petition becomes colorless after an interest-
ing opening:—•
In flaming martyrdom the stubble dies,
That from its ashes an enriched earth
May know again the glory and the worth
Of happy harvesting. The pasture sighs
Beneath the brazen, mirage-haunted skies;
Still are the birds : all hush'd the insect mirth,
And, in the languidness that follows birth,
Exhausted, drugg’d and drowsy, Summer lies 1
S. Elliott Napiek.
Of the six sonnets that remain for final ad-
judication no less than three are disqualified
owing to faults in technique. In W.L.D.’s
entry the rime of the first, fourth and eighth
line cannot strictly be allowed ; but, if this
slight fault were condoned, his sonnet is too
congested, and there is an uncouthness in
some of his lines that detracts from their
lucidity:—
Bright first bead on our twelvemonth rosary,
We tell thee at high altar of the sun,
Where oft, the past year’s toiling all undone,
Irrev’rent fires incense with misery
Of homes despoiled. Startling noon lethargy,
Through the hot vault deep diapasons stun
The trembling air; the rapid lightnings run,
And all midsummer imps hold revelry.
Yet as we bow to Phoebus’ strength, his beams
Are brimming fast the new year’s vintage cup,
That haply we may drink death to the drouth,
While soft autumnal thoughts balm fevered dreams,
And even as our hopeful eyes look up,
Comes a glad wind full of the cooling south.
W.L.D.
“Ecnirp’s” “January on the Plains” offers
us an extra foot in the sextette —a fault,
easily corrigible, due to the author’s careless-
ness ; and though fine sonnets have been writ-
ten in which there, is no pause or period at
the end of the octette, the sense running over
into the sestette without a break, the neater
modern usage is in favor of keening the twr
divisions as separate in construction as they
are in rime.
The day approaches as a flaming sword,
AVhich sweeps the plains of every breath of life.
The thirsty earth, unequal to thie strife,
Retreats within herself. Shadows afford
No welcome resting place. In hot accord
The beasts and birds flee from the blade
To wait until its fiery gleam will fade
Into the dark’ning night: The scanty hoard
Of waterhole and dam pays precious toll.
Perhaps at eVe a sullen russet cloud
Stirs living things to rise and hope again.
Old Sol retires before a hostile echoing roll,
And rushing on with whistling shrill and loud,
All-conquering comes the earth-reviving rain.
BONIRP.
JANUARY.
BY C. E. MOORE.
From blazing skies she comes with flaming
face,
And scant red robe the which no charm
conceals;
And Earth, the Titan, trembles when he
feels
The searing passion of her warm embrace.
Incarnate Summer, full of languorous grace
And ripened lusciousness, her beauty steals
All gain from virtue —only that appeals
When July, austere, reigneth in her place,
So January—by day a scorching flame,
By night a lio'uri breathing love and bliss,
Like erring mistress fearing words of blame
Who stops her lover with atoning tciss.
Ah! Hail the heat of torrid days that frame
The velvet splendors of a night like this!
The dosing day for entries for the sonnet
competition on our February is March 4.
Fiction
J. D. Beresford, author of Jacob Stahl and
The Hampdenshire Wonder, is one of the
new authors who count. Goslings (Heine-
mann, per George Robertson, Sydney ) is a
novel too remarkable for indiscriminate con-
sumption. Beresford has struck a big idea,
and worked it out with a realistic detail
possible only to authors of the calibre of
H. G. Wells. Compared with Beresford’s
new plague that practically wiped out the
male half of humanity, leaving the women
alive, Conan Doyle, in his ventures into the
future, and the hosts of writers who de-
scribe strange warfare in the air, are but
childish trihers. The new plague began in
Thibet, and swept over the world, killing in
its progress all the males except a few per-
sons who were for some cause immune. There
is thus left a world full of women, with bu.t
a few thousand males left to look after them,
in England the survivors probably number
1500 males. The problem brilliantly worked
out by the author is what in such a predica-
ment would happen to the race and inciden-
tally to our elaborate system of morality aud
law. In Beresford’s hands the solution is an
elaborate piece of sociological deduction,
through which runs a grim story, lit here and
there by romance.
The Goslings are the typical lower-middle-
class Londoners, futile, hide-bound and. in
the face of the upheaval of modern civilisa-
tion, utterly helpless. The father is a tame
clerk, the mother a specialised house-female,
and the two daughters pretty girls with a
mental outlook limited to the shop-fronts of
Oxford street. And into their lives, as into
the lives of everybody in London, the cata-
clysm comes. London’s incredulity, and then
London’s panic as the plague makes its ap-
pearance in England, the exodus from the
doomed city, and the death that followed
fast, making London a silent ruin—-all these
are graphically told. Then we take up the
story of the Qosling family. They had
managed to survive the starvation that fol-
lowed from the cutting off of all foVd-supplies
by looting a provision store, and the father
is one of the few males who escaped. How-
ever, this tame clerk suddenly finds that men,
and even tjime clerks, are at a premium In a
world of helpless women, and he disappears
from the story in the comoany of a parti-
cularly fine specimen of Girl. Then the two
girls explore the stricken and deserted city.
Everywhere is desolation and death, but they
find entrance into one of the great dress
shops at whose windows they had so often
vainly peered. The scene where the two girls
in the vast deserted building find dresses that
had been almost beyond their wildest dreams,
and excitedly ‘‘try on” one gorgeous costume
after another is done in a vein of mordant
irony. And the picture of the fnad women,
wearing the Rot of a Bond-street, jeweller’s,
has its full weight of horror.
Driven by the fear of starvation, the three
women trek into the country. They follow
, the route along which thousnnds of starving
women had fled to die. Already they see
the beginnings of a new civilisation, 'little
nuclei of capable farming women who have
managed to defend their holdings against
that ravenous but incompetent horde; And
here and there are more fortunate communi-
ties who have managed to get hold of one of
the few surviving men. Already a new
morality has arrived.
“It’s like Heaven, now, you see —no
marrying or giving in marriage. With one
man to every thousand women or so, what
can you expect? It’s uo good kicking against
it. It’s got to be,”
Jt
They come at last to Wycombe—fortunate
Wycombe that possesses a man. The young
butcher of Wycombe has taken the new situa-
tion in the easiest way. They meet him
drawn in a beflowered landau, round
which a dozen members of his harem were
dancing and singing. “They were graceless,
civilised savages; Bacchantes who had never
known the beauty of unconscious abandon-
ment. . . .In the carriage a man and a woman
were sitting side by side. The man
young, with strong claims to physical beauty
—tall, broad-shouldered, swarthy, with boldly
modelled features and heavily-lidded eyes.
But his skin was coarse; the bulk of his
body was too gross for clean, muscular
strength; his curly, well-oiled hair was thin-
ning at the temples ; his loose mouth leered
aud gaped. Pie was dressed in a suit of
broadly-patterned tweed, his great red fin-
gers were covered with rings, he wore a
heavy gold bangle on each thick, round wrist,
and a sweet, frail rose was thrust into his
black and greasy hair.” He had enthroned
beside him the temporarily reigning favorite
of his harem.
Millie Gosling escapes the butcher’s atten-
tions —for the time; and the women hasten
on. Better fortune meets them in the next
community, where a finer type of male has
organised a commumtv of women workers on
communistic lines. For a new law had made
itself from the ruins of all our laws: every
woman had a right to fyer share of food as
long as she had earned it by her labor. The
story of how this community strove with
and conquered the difficulties of providing a
food supply until the harvest is reaped is
admirably told. .Religion broke out in the
community, and was promptly dealt with by
the controlling committee. When Milly Gos-
ling comes back from Wycombe, no one
blames her. For the old morality was no
longer any use. “If a man is only to have
one wife now, the race will decline, probably
perish.. It is a woman’s duty to bear chil-
dren.” And when the kero falls in love with
the daughter of a duke, or something that
had no meaning in these new conditions, he
asks her fiercely: “Wouldn’t you be fright-
ened of me if I picked you up and ran shout-
ing into the woods V” And her eyes met his
without reserve. “Dear did man,” she said,
"I should love it.” Afterwards she was so
glad that there had been “no footle about
marriage.”
But though here and there throughout
England small communities of women and
an occasional man were evolving some sort
of temporary civilisation, what was going to
happen to the world? There weren’t enough
men to go round. The women had lost in-
terest ; the zest had gone from their lives.
They were, too tired at the end of the day’s
work to dress up. .. .and why dress up when
there were no men? Hysteria and vari-
ous forms of religious mania were rife. There
were no factories, and no one able to start
them.
“The age of iron and machinery was fall-
ing into a swift decline. AH that the coml-
- could look for in the future was a
return to primitive conditions and the fight
for bare life. Every year their tools and
machines would grow less efficient, every
year Nature would return more powerful to
the attack. In 10 years they would be fight-
ing her with rude and tedious weapons of
wood, grinding their scanty corn between
two stones, and living from hand to mouth.”
Then relief comes —how or whence we
need not here disclose. Goslings is a fantasy
by means of which Be res ford launches his
frank criticism of modern womankind.
d*
The most useful criticism of Polly anna.
by Eleanor H. Porter (Page, U.S.A., per
Dymock’s Libi’ary) is supplied by the pub-
lishers. It begins with: “First impression.
Feb. 1913,” and 10 lines later concludes:
“Tenth impression. Aug., 1913.” Pollyanna
is a sister of Little Lord Fauntleroy, and a
cousin of Little Eva. She never cries ; she
never is naughty; and she radiates such hap-
piness by just being glad that all the grumpy
persons—all grown-ups, you know, are
grumpy—exclaim unsteadily, “God bless you,
little girl!” or “Well, of all the —!” or
laugh the laugh that “sounds almost like a
sob,” while their hearts , are “stramrelv soft-
ened.” And-when, as is inevitable. Pollyanna
is run over and paralysed and “will never
walk again”—though the gentle reader knows
that the new doctor will cure her —“in kit-
chens and sitting-rooms, and over backyard
fences, women talked of it °nd went openly.
On street corners and in store lounging-
places the men talked, too, and wept—though
not so openly.” In fact the gravy of senti-
ment and pathos and child-humor is thick
and rich —which is just what circulating
library gravy should be.
<3,
It is a pity that Walter Kilroy Harris —
we add his labels, since lie seems fond of
them — F.R.G.S., F.E.C.1.. should have titled
his entertaining volume of Australian experi-
ences, Outback in Australia (Garden Citv
Press:; 55.). since his travels extended merely
over a triangle of wJiieh the points were
Brisbane. Adelaide and Melbourne. Walter
Kilro.v Harris merely got as far as Aus-
tralia’s backyard. However, lie is entitled
to the claim that his book is an account of
“the longest overlanding journey ever at-
tempted in Australia with a single horse,”
provided he narrows the term “overlanding”
to the extreme south-eastern corner of the
continent. The usual Australian connota-
tion. we may mention for the benefit of
Walter Kilroy Flams and his Fellows of the
Royo l Geoaranhical Society, is transconti-
nental. His pictures of life in the outback-
yard, however, are brilliantly done, his nar-
rative is picturesque, and his atmosphere
pleasantly Australian.
Ralph Stock has not caught, in The Py-
jama Man (N.S.W. Bookstall Co.), the
careless rapture of his earlier vivacious work.
The Recipe for Rubber. The lightness of
treatment is still evident in this romance of
the surf at Manly, but the story lacks body.
Cheerful reading for sun-bathers.

There is no risk if you buy a GEM JUNIOR
Safety Razor; it makes every man an expert
barber, and is the apex of Razor perfection.
Easy, velvet-like strokes— never a pull, never
a scratch, are features of the GEM JUNIOR,
which assures a clean, safe shave.
THE GEM JUNIOR is always ready for
use, with a fresh blade for every day of the week.
It is so simple that a novice can use it.
GEM JUNIOR BLADES are as thin as
an edge-holding piece of steel can possibly be rolled.
They can be sharpened time and time again, be-
cause they’re tempered to receive an edge and
to hold it when they get it.
THE GEM JUNIOR FRAME has a new
bar feature, which carefully spreads the skin, so
that the stubble is forced out far enough to give
as close a shave as can be secured by going over
the face twice with any other razor.
THE GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR
is made and finished in the best style, of the
finest materials, and the Highest Skilled labor.
It comprises Nickel Plated Frame, Extra Handle for
Stropping Blades, and SEVEN Keen-edged Blades.
Complete in neat Leatherette Case.

that they are accurate, reliable and uniform, in a word the best

Do you feel fit
in the mornings ?
In the hot weather
when a man wakes in
the morning it is no
uncommon thing for
him to feel more tired
than when he went to
bed.
The heat /of Summer
between latitudes 10°
and 39° south may
easily provoke a general
stagnation of the sys-
tem.
The juices of the body
are charged with impuri-
ties which the organs of
excretion the skin,
kidneys, etc. cannot
effectively expel ; the
liver is sluggish. You
are at the mercy of every
disease germ that can
attack the system.
Krttschen
Salts
A half-teaspoonful of Kriis-
chen Salts taken in a tumbler
of hot water before the
morning cup of tea is an
unfailing remedy.
They cleanse the body of
impurities gently, surely
and painlessly—whilst pos-
sessing wonderful tonic
properties giving new life
and vitality to the countless
millions of cells of which the
human body is composed.
Flesh, blood, bone, brain
and nerve are all made up of
cells, and every cell requires
one or more of the con-
stituents of Kruschen Salts
for its healthy life.
That is why doctors recom-
mend this famous remedy.
Kruschen Salts correct any
derangement of the organs
and fortify the body against
all forms of ague, dysentery
and eczematous irritation.
As a remedy for constipa-
tion they are infallible.
Begin to-morrow morning
with Kriischen Salts
and in a day or so you
will enjoy the vivacity
and vigour of perfect
well-being. Slackness
and depression vanish
and in their place comes
the healthy man’s feeling
of confident optimism.
Kriischen Salts are not
effervescent. They can
therefore be taken with-
out any fear of flatulence
so often produced by
“ fizzy drinks.”

I Can Introduce
You to Hundreds
of Sufferers that
I Have Cured of
VARICOSE
VEINS!
MB. G. VECSEY.
IF YOU suffer from Varicose Veins or Ulcers, or both, I believe that 1
can completely cure you. I have treated hundreds of terrible cases
with the utmost success, and I know that but very few cases are really
incurable. _ Very few doctors tell you they can cure this trouble. They
prefer to ignore it. Doctors could not cure me. I cured myself. I then
cured my friends, and then made hundreds of new friends by curing people
who had suffered in some cases for a quarter of a century. Hence I believe
I can cure you. It will pay you well to fully investigate my method.
My treatment is applied at your own home, does not require you to lay up, and is painless and
harmless, the worst cases usually respond inside the first few weeks, and old, stubborn cases are
perfectly cured under a suitable course of treatment. Give me full details of your case If I can
cure you I will say so, and send you a guarantee. If I cannot, I will at once advise you’. You run
no risk. You can lose nothing if I should fail; but I have built up a large business—not on fail-
ures, but on successes, in cases formally given up as hopeless. LET ME SEND YOU SCORES OF
GRATEFUL TESTIMONIALS. WE GET DOZENS OF LETTERS LIKE THE FOLLOWING
Manager Vecsey Varix-arium, Wimmera St., Stawell, Vic., May 5, 1913.
Hear Sirs, —Am sorry I have not been more punctual in my correspondence,
but Ido not need any more treatment. The ulcers are entirely healed, and the
veins are now normal, and totally free from aches or pain, and I can get about
again, for which 1 am very happy. I have told numbers of people of your
splendid treatment, and it certainly justifies the claims you make for it
When I began your treatment I was dreadfully crippled, and almost wholly
incapacitated, and I shall never fail to recommend the Vecsey Method whenever
I get an opportunity.—Yours gratefully, James Williams.

“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in
the week. It is' now 12 months since I last used
tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke, therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-
ness, Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I
have every reason to believe were caused through the
use of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are
only remembered as a hideous nightmare. I eat
and sleep well, and feel fit to face the world again.
It will give me great pleasure to recommend your
remedv to others. ”

On the Northern Road.
Through ways made strange by a magic hand
One morn on the Northern Road,
Like a lone, lone soul in an alien land—
A dead man’s land —I strode.
I heard no bird and I saw no bloom,
And the world’s loud winds were dead;
For all night long from a hidden loom
Had a web of wonder sped.
No house-dog barked, and I heard no shout
Of wayside lads that played ;
Like ghosts I saw the trees rush out,
Like ghosts I saw them fade.
My blood grew chill and a master-fear
Around, about me fell;
My senses ailed to see and hear,
And touch, and taste, and smell.
I said, “When Death’s dark mists o’erwhelm
Some pallid soul, sad-eyed,
In truth it knows no stranger realm
Than this, wherein I bide.
I left hot-foot that land unblest,
And ere the morn was done
I climbed a slope, and on its crest
I gloried in the sun.
And now, when life grows grey and chill
And trouble trumpets war,
I see the sun on Harper’s Hill—
The mists on Lochinvar.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
An Idyll of Distrustful Joy.
A bitter wind blew down the dark
And tingling on men’s noses smote,
And it was sad to see and mark
A world without an overcoat;
But we were snug and safe and warm,
Close-nestled in a pleasant place—
She in the shelter of my arm,
I in the glowing of her face.
Her hair, in splendid coils of flame,
Blushed as she breathed my happy cheek :
And all small joys that have no name
Played at a dimpled hide-and-seek
About the sweetness of her chin
And the hot scarlet of her lips,
Where little hints of laughter thin
Sat trembling on a sigh’s eclipse.
Which ought to make it pretty plain
That times were good and seasons brisk,
And youth and pleasure once again
Prepared to take love’s ancient risk '
Of rheumatism, and the chill
Which brings pneumonia in its wake,
Lest gladness from her cup should spill
One drop that gleaming eyes may take.
Yes, everything was very nice,
And nothing troubled us at all;
We could have sat on polar ice
Without a blanket or a shawl.
(Which fact some scientist may trace
To its remote and hidden seat,
And show how kisses on the face
Are forces to develop heat.)
I swore some tremulous large vows
In whispers at her shell-curled ear,
Which, like old Pharaoh’s leanest cows,
Ate up the oaths of yesteryear;
thoughts of damsels, dark or fair,
\Y hose eyes were black or brown or grey,
With one full wisp of rosy hair
I brushed from memory away.
The moon was worn a little thin,
The stars were rather weak and pale,
One cloudlet like a small grey sin
On wind-blown whiskers seemed to sail;
And. softly nestled on my knee
Like wild delight the dark makes tame,
The maiden lightly turned to me
And wonder-wistful asked my name.
I knew the tragic hour had struck.
The simple query hit me hard,
Yet, trusting to my love and luck,
I gave her someone else’s card.
Then, like a crimson rose a-swoon
With summer on its petal tips,
She raised against the dying moon
The grateful splendor of her lips.
The night grew very cold and late.
We parted with hot tears unshed.
I led her to her garden gate
And kissed six portions of her head.
Iler hair was like a thick-coiled flame;
Small dimples played about her chin,
She blushed as red as rosy shame
And laughed as light as silver sin.
And now when nights are bleak and chill
I walk alone in ways remote,
And watch the weary world that still
Goes round without its overcoat;
And while a sick moon rides above
And pale stars keep their watch and ward
I wonder if the eyes of love
Are reading someone else’s card.
N.S.W.
PAT O’MAORI.
Married.
We scabbard in wi’ courtesy
The uaked steel o’ hate,
And so we live our lives along
And so we watch and wait.
And so we face our little world,
And play our little parts ;
H e ha’ bartered both our bodies
But the dead folk hold our hearts.
And in the cosy bright room,
Wi’ all the curtains drawn,
There is nothing left to pray for
But the coming o’ the dawn.
And oftentimes there one will turn
An’ strike a sudden light,
To rid the breathing darkness
O’ the ghosts that haunt the night.
Our heads upon one pillow rest,
But we’ve neither chick nor wean,
An’ its sad an’ sore an’ sorry
lien the dead folk peer between.

A Halley Lorry carrying Wool in the Rough Back Country.
The “Man-on-the-land”
Appreciates the Halley.
For the heavy transport of wool and produce in the rough out-back country
the Halley Motor Lorry has proved invaluable. It will carry bigger loads
than horse teams, carry them quicker and at less cost.
The speediness of the Halley alone is an advantage. It practically brings
the markets nearer and often means the gaining of the best prices. The
Halley, moreover, unlike horses, does not tire. It performs its work at
the end of a long trip with undiminished efficiency.
All models of the Halley built for Australia embody the recommendations of

The last public declaration from a responsible Japanese source was to the effect that the attitude of the United States upon the colored immigration question was unsatisfac-
tory, and that a modification of the exclusion policy would have to be sought in other ways... .Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Legislature united to defeat all Asiatic
exclusion amendments to the Immigration Bill just passed. —Daily paper.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
papei (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions , ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, Tiie Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
emen loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR
ESTEEMED BROWNISH FRIEND.
The lengthy and muffled argument between
Japan and the United States re the Japanese
demand for free access to California and the
other States of Abraham Lincoln’s Union
has been temporarily concluded. It isn’t
likely that it is permanently concluded, be-
cause the debate between the white man and
the colored one is endless, but things are
patched up for the moment. Nippon pre-
sented something dimly suggestive of an ulti-
matum, and the Government and Congress
at Washington climbed down. The Jap is to
have the free run of the United States,
until something happens. The color, line is
thrown overboard, and the pomp of the Pil-
grim Fathers is up a tree. Some people
might regard the claims of Japan as almost
outrageous, but’the Japanese, with his bland
front and his inscrutable countenance, is
capable of claiming almost anything. He is
often outrageous, but he is so plausible that
he seldom looks that way. His profession is
that he freely admits foreigners into his
country, therefore his people should be freely
admitted into other countries. And it is quite
true that he freely admits foreigners into
his country—in fact, he receives them with
open arms, and a beaming smile, and a
geisha, and a yoshiwarra, and all manner
of gay appurtenances. But when they are in
he makes it so impossible, by his thousand
small restrictions and his million pin-prick
regulations, for them to do business that
they seldom take any Jap. legal tender away
with them. What they are allowed to do is
to go round viewing the sights and the girls,
and spending money. The white mau isn’t
so agile at the pin-prick policy, so when he
lets Nippon into his country he finds that
Nippon has come to stay, and then he gets
angry in public and begins to dash things
round openly. In fact, he is short of plausi-
bility. Here are a few recent records:—
Japanese
December Foreigners Japanese U.S. citizens in U.S.

1908 .. 17,893 326,161 1684 219,106
The later statistics are still unfinished, but
even so far as the completed records go the
Nipponese were doing very well at the work
of keeping the white man out of their land
and pushing their way into his land. Their
ferocious clamor about the other fellow’s
objection to a free and unlimited Japanese
influx is interesting in the circumstances.
* * * *
As already mentioned, the United States
has climbed down. The Pacific Coast, where
the trouble lies, is a long way from Washing-
ton, just as Australia is a long way from
London. And as Washington, like London,
hasn’t the Asiatic at its own door, it can’t
see why the other place, which has the
Asiatic, not only at the door but right inside
the house, should feel annoyed. The same
sort of thing happens in Canada, where Brit-
ish Columbia, on the Pacific Coast, wants
to keep the Mongol out, and the Govern-
ment at Ottawa, which is far east and quite
unaffected by the intruder, can’t imagine
what the disturbance is about. The Legis-
latures at Washington and Ottawa and Lon-
don know all about the undesirable from
Continental Europe because he lands on their
personal doorstep. At various times they
have made most stringent laws against him.
But they fail to see why the undesirable from
Asia should be objected to, seeing that he
doesn’t land where the Cabinet can person-
ally view and consider and smell him. That
is where Australia, unless it makes far more
strenuous efforts for its own defence, is likely
to fall in. At present it is almost as depen-
dent on London for the maintenance of its
white policy as California is on Washington,
and California has found Washington verv
much what Isaiah, the prophet, found
Egypt. When the Brown Man’s veiled ulti-
matum comes this way there are reasons why
London is likely to climb down even more
suddenly than Washington has done.
In the first place, Japan is Britain’s ally
while it isn’t Uncle Sam’s ally. A quarrel
with Japau would mean that the fighting
value of some 50 big ships (to say nothing of
a lot of small ones) would be subtracted from
the. British strength and added to the list
of its enemies. That would make a differ-
ence of 100 big ships. To the U.S. a quarrel
with Japan would only mean a difference of
50 ships. The British Empire, so far as
population goes, is mostly colored and
Asiatic, and J. Bull has a horror of draw-
ing the color line and of speaking uncivilly
to any colored Asiatic lest he should knock
the prop from underneath the throne. The
United States Dominion is mostly white, and
it has drawn the colored line so many times
already, and in so mahy ways, that it could
hardly make things much worse by drawing
the same old line once more. Britain would
have the great bulk of its empire at stake
in a serious naval war, for most of the
scattered premises of Geo. V. are only de-
fensible by sea. The United States hazards,
in a sea campaign on the Asiatic side, the
Philippines, which it has almost decided to
abandon in any case; the scrappy Kanaka
islands of Hawaii, Guam (210 square miles),
a fragment of Samoa, and possibly, but not
probably, the frost-bitten district of Alaska.
The kernel of the American Empire is the
States themselves —nearly 3,000,000 square
miles—and only the small and comparatively
valueless residue is liable to be captured by
salt-water aggression. On the other hand
Britain has 11,300,000 square miles of
scattered and accessible possessions, depen-
dent for defence in the last extremity on
the ships of a little North Sea archipelago
of 121,000 square miles. Again, Britain has
its merchant fleets on every coast, all liable
to capture in case of a big scrap on the
waters, while the U.S. has no mercantile
marine of any importance to be seized. And
Britain’s unutterable dread is a naval re-
verse, because it now depends almost en-
tirely on imported food, and a comparatively
short blockade might bring down its pride
and dignity and power like a house of cards.
The U.S. can more than feed itself, and 100
years of blockade would hardly starve it
into submission. It might even amuse itself
during the blockade by annexing Mexico and
Canada and Central America, and become
greater than ever. On the face of things the
United States is a dozen times better quali-
fied than Britain to consign to the Devil any
Asiatic Power which objects to its immigra-
tion laws. Yet Japan hinted, gently and
diplomatically, at the possibility of trouble
over the question of White California, and,
as hereinbefore described, Washington
climbed down. When Japan drops the same
kind of hint re the question of White Aus-
tralia, and London climbs down, and this
country, with its empty Northern Territory,
and its unbuilt northern railway, and its
exhausted credit, and its army of school
children, and its mere semblance of a navy
must either give in or set up for itself and
fight its own battle ! ! !
* * * #
There is one more reason why London is
even more likely to give way than Washing-
ton when the Japanese lodges his protest
against White Australia as he has already
done against White California. The United
States, now that the Panama Canal is in
working order, could concentrate all its naval
force against the enemy, and it is no small
naval force when everything is counted. And
it could rush all its available troops to oppose
a possible landing of the enemy. It wouldn’t
be afraid lest the Mexican hosts should take
the country while its regiments were other-
wise engaged, for Mexico has no hosts —-only
brigands. But Britain has the German bogey
looking over its back fence. It must, with
its dependence on imported food, retain
enough ships in its home waters to abso-
lutely ensure itself against this spectre. And
when that is done there aren’t enough ships
left, evep in the stupendous British fleet, to
defend the White Australia policy should
Japan become hostile in real earnest, assum-
ing that Father Bull was serious in
the defence of the White Australia
policy. Britain under present conditions
couldn’t send so big a fleet against Nippon
as the United States could —the republic
that has just climbed down, as once or twice
alluded to in the course of this article. It
might help our land defence materially with
its handy and numerous Indian troops, but if
White Australia had to fall back on a col-
ored soldiery it wouldn’t have much white
dignity left, and it could never draw the color
line again without feeling that it was some-
thing of an ass and a good deal of a fraud.
* * * *
The moral of it all is that this country
doesn’t take its white status seriously. It is
too much addicted to relying on paper
statutes and regarding the thing as settled
because it is formally enacted, and duly
printed in black ink on white paper. The
baby fleet, the army of infants, the absurd
factory which turns out one gun-barrel or
more every three months, the neglect of
immigration, the policy which makes no pro-
vision for the defence of the north-western
half of Australia save by appointing a horse-
doctor to be a sort of viceroy at Darwin —
all these matters will look very small when
London is up against the question which has
just been put to Washington. And if the
Jap. is a consistent sort of person he will
assuredly put the question to London as soon
as he is ready. He has had the subject on
his mind for quite a while.
DACEYVILLE.
Fkom J. D. Fitzgerald, chairman of the
N.S.W. Housing Board :
In The Bulletin of 29/1/T4 appeared the follow-
ing :
“And even Daceyville is in trouble; a recent
deputation declared that the rents were too high,
and a harassed Labor Minister said that the buildings
had cost so much that, even at the present allegedly
high rents, the place was a dead loss and a pauper
institution. So the interview ended to the dissatis-
faction of all parties.’’
I was not fortunate enough to see in print the
allegation of the “harassed Minister” that “the place
was a dead loss and a pauper institution.” If he did
say so, it must have been through want of knowledge
of the true facts. Let me place them before the
nublic; for the matter is of the highest public in-
terest and importance.
Here follows a description of the excellent
fashion in which Daceyville is laid out. To
this The Bulletin makes no objection
whatsoever.
* * * *
The business part of the scheme is prescribed by
law. The rents must be fixed at such a rate as will
bring a return sufficient to pay 4 p.c. on land and
buildings, together with assurances, rates, taxes,
repairs and maintenance, a share of the expenses of
administration and a sinking fund on a 50 years’
basis. The land was charged against the scheme at
£65 per acre, and the estimated cost of “subdivision
work”—such as drainage, levelling, road-making,
kerbing and guttering, etc.—was £312 per acre.
Every charge which a private owner makes against
his property save one—profit—is made against the
scheme. The State desires no profit save what is
gained to the whole community in the enhancement
of the comfort, health and happiness of the people
who live in it; and the comparatively small relief
(none the less valuable as an example) which it
affords to the terrible hygienic and moral problem of
housing- congestion in Sydney.
The rents are, of course, based upon the
cost of the scheme and the sinking-fund period.
It will be seen that the tenants pay for the whole
scheme. It cannot, under these circumstances, be a
“pauper institution,” nor is there the slightest sus-
picion of charity in the matter. The rents for the
first cottages were fixed at 17s , but a re-appraise-
ment was found necessary (the Board having had to
fix the rents before the returns of cost were available
for the first houses built), and as these houses become
vacant the tenants will pay 18s. For the same class
of cottage in Mosman or any similar suburb, on land
half the size, you cannot find a rent lower than
£1 ss. to £1 10s. For the second class of cottage
the rent is 14s. 6d. Besides the modern conveniences
mentioned above the cottages have verandahs back
and front, specially designed for outdoor sleeping.
* * * *
And then conies another mass of litera-
ture about the pleasant life led at Dacey-
ville, which, as this paper cast not one
single brick at the hygienic aspect of that
suburb, will be taken as read. It is hereby
fully admitted unless evidence to the con-
trary turns up.
But Mr. Fitzgerald admits, after all,
that Daceyville isn’t quite financial, because
houses are let at 17s. a week which should
have been rented at 18s. in order to make
the scheme solvent. That was, perhaps,
what the Minister was thinking of when he
told the deputation 'that asked for reduced
rents (Mr. Fitzgerald says the rents aie
surprisingly low already) that the enter-
prise wasn’t paying its way, which cer-
tainly implied pauperism. On this matter
the Auditor-General has made some remarks.
He said that the shortage for the first year,
when the buildings were still new
and the accounts for repair and reno-
vation hadn’t begun to come in, was
£207, and as the sinking fund contribu-
tion was £97, that meant that there was no
payment whatever to the sinking fund, and
a considerable deficit besides. Also he said
that a sinking fund scheme, which was to
repay capital in 50 years, assumed a remark-
ably long life for the Daceyville cottages.
In these circumstances this paper fails to
see what reason Mr. Fitzgerald has to com-
plain of its observations. It didn’t say a
word against the sanitation or plan or
methods of Daceyville—only about the very
casual finances. When the year’s liabilities
are £1357, and the year’s income is £lO9O,
and the year’s deficit is £267, or nearly 20
per cent., it certainly seems that somebody is
living, in part at least, a pauper existence on
somebody—presumably on the general tax-
payer. And the Auditor-General added that
the interest on the capital value of the land
had not been charged in the accounts.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Gentle Art of Lurking.
Dr. Fiaschi, of Sydney, appears to be at
times one of those people who see ghosts in
the dark. Speaking of a perfectly ordinary
and commonplace and respectable part of
Australia, he is reported to have spoken thus
to the Medical Congress in Maoriland: —
It should be incumbent on the officers to carry out
a strict physical examination of all young male in-
habitants, to make a searching test of the soundness,
strength and virility of the rising generation. The
second problem dealt with a possibility of having
to send an expeditionary force to the Northern
Territory, which was likely to become a point of
invasion. A great number of unknown diseases pro-
bably lurk in the Territory.
Now why should unknown diseases “lurk”—
“lurk” is a very fine word —in one thinly-
peopled section of North Australia, when
they don’t lurk in the more populated sec-
tions which occupy the same latitude, and
are just as hot, and often a great deal more
damp. Up the west coast of Australia mys-
terious horrors don’t lurk worth 2d. Nor
do they lurk worth 3*d. up the east coast,
for Rockhampton and Townsville and
Mackay and Cairns and Cooktown are good
enough. They don’t lurk to the extent of
an old pair of boots in the top parts of
Queensland and the Territory, for quite a
healthy population lives there. They don’t
lurk on the farthest horizon to the south, at
the end of the unfinished railway from Port
Augusta. For many, many years line re-
pairers have ridden from end to end of the
Territory keeping the transcontinental tele-
graph in order, and missionaries and pro-
spectors and police and even a bishop, a
university professor and a State Governor
have crossed the province from end to end,
and not a single lurk did they ascertain.
TLjy were strong men and armed, and they
badly wanted to bring some stuffed lurks
back with them, yet they got nothing. Why
should it always be assumed that there is a
skeleton in the unopened cupboard, and that
all manner of horrors are lying low in the
coal-scuttle in the shadow, and that there is
a spook round the next corner? Every place
is a scene of mystery to a credulous and
superstitious generation which hasn’t been
there. That was why England was once
supposed to be an isle where the ghosts of
the dead wandered in misery, wringing their
hands on the present site of London, and
weeping wretchedly all round Birmingham
and Liverpool— not to mention Wolverhamp-
ton.
♦
Some of the Realities of War.
“The Old Soldier” writes: —
What the S. M. Herald called “one of the most
important discussions of the Political Labor League
Conference” befell in Sydney the other day. 'Two
local leagues submitted resolutions asking for the
abolition of compulsory military training, and
another proposal from the sub-committee on Federal
affairs called for a ltoyal Commission to inquire into
the whole Defence scheme. Then Stuart-Robertson,
M.L.A., said that he had “no sympathy with the
idea that Acts of Parliament could make either
capable or enthusiastic soldiers out of unwilling
citizens.”
He might have added that no Act of Parliament
can make enthusiastic taxpayers out of unwilling
economists, or enthusiastic washers out of unwilling
dirty people, or enthusiastic prisoners out of unwill-
ing burglars, drunks, assault-and-battery men, and
bigamists; nor can compulsion turn unwilling non-
unionists into enthusiastic unionists. And the best
brand of religion can’t turn unwilling sinners after
death into enthusiastic damned. It might even be
added that when Stuart-Robf.rtson finds his dog
raiding the dinner-table, and the mongrel is unwill-
ing to depart, he can’t turn that animal into an
enthusiastic fasting beast in the back yard by chasing
it out.
But, after all, why all this talk about the “unwill-
ing citizen” in war matters? This country has adult
suffrage in all Federal affairs, and unless the
majority is in favor of compulsory military training,
how did the thing get on to the statute-book and
stay there? Of course no one, save a fool, really
imagines that it is the Act of Parliament itself that
is to turn the unwilling loafer or drifter into a sol-
dier. That is the job of the drill sergeant, author-
ised by the Act of Parliament.
J. C. Watson threw himself into the breach, but
was interrupted in this fashion: —
A Delegate: “Perhaps you have something in the
country to defend.”
The remark made Watson somewhat angry, and
like Jonah (chapter 4, verse 9) he had justification.
Australia has the most liberal suffrage on earth. It
has had more Labor Government than any other
country ,in modern times. Yet there are still Labor-
ites who profess that the people of Australia, and
the Labor party of Australia, have made such a hash
of their opportunities that the country isn’t worth
defending against a foreign invader. They don’t think
their liberties, and their homes, and their wives
and children, and their trades unions, and their old-
age pensions, and their Arbitration Courts, and their
eight-hours procession good enough to amount to
a stake in the country.
Of course, it goes without saying that these folk
never had hostile soldiers quartered on them, and
saw foreign troops putting their muddy feet on the
dining-room table, and pawing the women and girls
of the household, and eating up the victuals, and
plundering the household treasures, including the
baby’s photo, and the beer and the Saturday night's
wages. They were never hanged for objecting to the
ways of the invaders, or had their feet put in the
fire to make them reveal the whereabouts of imagin-
ary savings. They haven’t yet been flogged for being
out after dark contrary to martial law, or shot for
refusal to work on the basis of bare rations upon the
invader’s fortifications, or otherwise tortured and
scragged because they objected to being the hostile
army’s beasts of burden. All these things are liable
to happen in war time to the nation which hasn’t
learned the complete art of defence—especially to
the nation which is the white man’s most lonesome
and undefended outpost, and which has angered
a warlike community 10 times its size by its nigger
exclusion policy. And all these things do happen,
even in our days of alleged civilisation, and happen
frequently. In the late Balkan war, men and women
and children had their hands and feet cut off, their
eyes put out and their tongues amputated, and there
was unpleasantness all round—by reason of an
Asiatic enemy who was no worse than some that
Australia may have to meet before long.
Yet, as already mentioned, there are blithered
patriots in this country who at once suspect any
advocate of defence of being a bloated capitalist and
the possessor of portable property. The idea is
strangely wooden-headed. It isn’t the bloated capi-
talist who suffers most in war time. Sometimes he
buys off the invader, and sometimes he flees in his
motor-car, .and gets out of the trouble. He needn’t
stay unless he wants to. But the man who can't
bolt and who has nothing to offer by way of ransom
save his wife and daughters and his own body and
his own slave-labor, is liable to experience a bad
time. His wages stop because the factory or shop
is shut up. His little savings vanish because the
savings bank closes owing to its assets being nnreaiis-
able. His life-assurance policy might as well be on
the planet Jupiter. In fact, he is simply the in-
vader’s famished dog, and he hasn’t a dog license to
protect him.
«
Six Millions.
It has been seriously announced that it is
necessary to spend another £6,000,000 on
providing extended wharfage for the port of
Sydney. A great deal of this sum will go
to private landlords for the repurchase of soil
at inflated prices, said prices having been
inflated by the policy which aims at drag-
ging all the commerce of a huge State to
one city regardless of convenience or ex-
pense. It isn’t suggested that the outlay
will return big dividends ; that it will help
along the policy of State land-ownership:
that it will save places like Monaro and
Riverina and New England paying absurd
and ruinous railway freights that their ex-


ports may be carried to a remote port when
there is an equally good one close at hand ,
that it will make the Sydney house famine
any less acute; or that it will alleviate tne
lot of the sheep which spends a week with-
out food or water in the truck on the long
and overburdened railway that leads to tne
Only Port. None of these matters come into
the calculation. If the amount in question
was devoted to building two scraps ot rail-
way to connect the existing N.S.W. lines
with Port Stephens and Twofold Bay, to
constructing a few wharves there, and to
resuming adjacent lands at their existing
value —which is not much more than prairie
or wilderness value —something might hap-
pen. That is to say, the State might be-
come sole ground landlord of two new cities
which would, before very many years had
passed, be as great as Sydney. In other
words, the ground each city stood upon
would be worth something like £45,000,000.
That would be a very fine asset for the
State, as well as a relief to the Sydney
house scarcity and the railway pressure,
and a magnificent vindication of the policy
of public landlordism. Unfortunately, the
so-called Labor Government of N.S.W. —
partly composed of Sydney landlords —seems
to be too busy looking after the dirty,
squalid, miserable interests of Toryism to
consider the large national propositions on
its programme. The N.S.W. Tory pressis
centred in Sydney, and has its biggest in-
vestments and profits there. It is com-
mitted. in its own interests, to the Conges-
tion idea. And so long as the Holman
Government sinks those features of its pro-
gramme which are really hateful to the old
somnolent crowd, the Tory press has no rea-
son to be any more disagreeable than it can
avoid while “saving its face.” It may have
been that the politically-petrified papers re-
garded some of the second ballot results at
last State election as suspicious. They may
have even viewed them as outrageous. Still
they said very little; in fact, they said
almost nothing. Why should they throw the
clod of exposure at a Cabinet which, if
roused to fury, might get level by honestly
carrying out its policy of decentralisation
and its creed of the public ownership of
land? It might even go farther, and carry
out its pledge to reduce borrowing and to
spend loan money only upon works which
will nay full interest and sinking fund, and
the financial profligates of the Sydney daily
press would regard that kind of integrity as
Sheol. If the Tory backsliding of the
Holman Government earns the good-
humored forbearance of the backslid press of
Sydney, the press certainly gets good value
in return.

The Pious Press Begins to Mention It.
Last week both the S. M. Herald and the
Sydney Evening News struggled suffici-
ently over the barrier of their false modesty
to hint that syphilis should be made a notifi-
able disease, like such comparatively unim-
portant troubles as small-pox and consump-
tion and plague and leprosy; and that a
national campaign should be started against
it. There is really more need nowadays for
a national campaign against syphilis than
against all other diseases put together. It
falls alike on the just and the unjust. It
is handed down from generation to genera-
tion, and the person who has innocently
acquired it may pass it along to other inno-
cent people in many ways. It may not
directly kill many people, but it leads to
blindness, idiocy, paralysis, locomotor ataxia,
skin annoyances, general debility, baldness,
bow-legs, knock knees, dwarfs, hunchbacks
and every kind of human decay and dry-rot.
For a long, long time one of the polite con-
ventions of Snuffledom was to the effect that
this complaint should not be alluded to save
indirectly, and that its existence should be
ignored. There was a sort of impression or
mental haze that it might be wiped out by a
process of disqualification, just as the Alps
might be flattened by making it illegal to
mention them. Now Snuffle is itself being
disqualified and flattened out, and there is
hope that the worst evil known to man will
be seriously attacked. The fact that the
S. M. Herald and Evening News have
begun to mention it by name, instead of
alluding to it vaguely as the inward thing-
umbob or the devastating whatyoumaycallit,
is a sign of progress.

Some Notes and Queries with a Bearing
on Women’s Suffrage.
Dear Bulletin, —Discussion in the Vic.
Assembly on the question of equal pay for
both sexes of State school teachers has
weakened this child’s enthusiasm for the
equality doctrine. There must be something
in the Watt Government’s contention that
the “injustice to women” is a pardonable
economy, because the men, as a rule, give
life-long service to the State, whereas 300
women teachers, on an average, leave the
service every year to get married. It might
be added that a large percentage of the 300
take male teachers to husband. Surely the
young man, who doesn’t dream of quitting
his job to get married, is likely to be a more
valuable servant than the young woman who
does. Anyhow, the Labor members showed
a strange lack of imagination when they pro-
tested that any reference to the annual
exodus of brides-elect was “beside the ques-
tion” of equal pay for equal work. It is
more than questionable whether an unearnest
young spinster with matrimony in her spark-
ling eye is as valuable a worker as the young
man (single or married) who has his profes-
sional prospects in view. I would suggest
that this hard and fast Parliamentary swear-
ing by the equality of the sexes is mostly a
bid for the women’s vote on polling day. A
politician bidding for a vote will say any-
thing. For instance, G. M. Prendergast
professed to favor higher pay for women
teachers on the ground that “the more they
were cared for the less likely they were te
hastily marry.” After which he assured the
House that “a decreasing birthrate followed
when people of comparative poverty married.”
Which was so transparently untruthful that
Orangeman Snowball interjected: “The
highest birthrate is among the noorest
people.” as a gentle reminder that Prender-
gast had better shut up. If all the arguments
in favor of treating women as men for edu-
cational business purposes (and making the
taxpavers provide the extra expense) are no
sounder than Prendergast’s amazing argu-
ments, it is time for everybody to shut up.
Are all women workers to receive higher
wages as an inducement for them to refrain
from getting married, as soon as possible?
Is the State to act as an anti-matrimonial
agency? Are we to assume that an addition
of a few pounds a year to a school teacher-
ess’s salary for a few years would enable her
to make an “excellent match,” when she was
getting a bit old in the tooth, whereas the
denial of the increment causes her to rush
into a married state of comparative poverty
while she is young and blooming? I repeat
my allegation that a politician bidding for
votes will say anything. Thus the extension
of the franchise to women has deepened the
profundity of my disrespect for politicians.
Formerly they had only the men’s votes to bid
for, and they were at least reasonable, ac-
cording to their ancient lights, in discussing
questions concerning payment of women.
Now, they have also to curry favor with the
less reasonable sex, and they talk nonsense
on both sides, the nonsense they sometimes
utter on the female side of their constituency
—when they are agin the Government —be-
ing audaciously stupid. How else are we to
account for the Labor party’s voting to in-
crease the Estimates by hundreds of pounds
in order that women school teachers may de-
lay their entrance into matrimony, and
become larger producers of offspring on
account of the delay?—Yours etc., “0.K.”
The Sydney Meat Convulsion.
So far as the public convenience or incon-
venience goes the Sydney meat strike is, or
was—it may be over by the time this appears
in nrint—a harmless sort of business. There
will always be a certain amount of beef
hanging round at a price; also there remain
bacon and ham and tinned foods and vege-
tables and sundries for the over-fed Fat Man
to fall back upon. The affluent stomach gets
through somehow. The bullock doesn’t mind
waiting a day or two longer in the paddock
to be killed. The anguished Railway De-
partment is glad of a rest from stock trains,
so that it may try its hand at moving the
wheat harvest. And the fact that one more
agreement has been burst up and one more
boulder thrown at the industrial arbitration
principle hardly matters now, for there is
only a tattered rag of the arbitration prin-
ciple left. The strikers were working under
an agreement—it is wholly probable that
the wages fixed by the agreement were in-
adequate as alleged—and the agreement was
broken just as casually as if it had been a
Mexican general’s oath of allegiance. No
one thought of keeping it when it didn’t suit,
and no one thought it worth while to be
seriously angry about the breakage, for that
was all in the day’s work. Nowadays when
an industrial trouble happens the Arbitra-
tion Court counts for little; union officials
for less; the Minister for Labor and Indus-
try for nothing at all. The attitude of
trades-unionism is that it doesn’t know
enough to create a Government that knows
enough to supply a legal remedy for the
grievances of its supporters. So it runs its
show by sporadic insurrection against its
officials and its Ministry and its Parlia-
mentary majority and its programme and
its own industrial organisations. In a
manner of speaking, it kicks itself along.
As the chronic rebellion isn’t done in the
chronic Mexican fashion with guns and
dynamite, and as it is generally a perfectly
good-humored and gentlemanly shindy, no-
body is badly hurt. Worse things happen
at a football match. The real harm or
absurdity lies in the fact that every strike
is a declaration on the part of Labor that
it is too great an ass to make a success of
one of its most cherished ideals. Even
though it owns the whole machinery of
State it says that it doesn’t know how to
get decent wages for a butcher’s assistant
save by the clumsy, wasteful methods which
it had to adopt when its enemies owned the
machinery. The position seems illogical,
but there is nothing in it that is worth get-
ting really wild and apoplectic about. It
isn’t a bad thing to have a meat stoppage.
This community eats too much hot. fat beef,
especially in the summer time, and the best
thing it can do at a flesh crisis is to buy a
water melon and remain calm.
About Slouch, Junior.
The Victorian military authorities have dis-
covered that a large proportion of the shirk-
ing cadets who are run into the Queenscliff
camp to do their arrears of drill are not
Quakers, nor youths with other varieties of
religious scruple, but cigarette fiends. Also
they are mostly dirty about the face, and
matted about the hair, and shambling about
the feet, and the post-leaning habit has got
them badly. As a rule the clean, perpendicu-
lar boy who doesn’t smoke attends his drill
voluntarily; while the unclean, sloping one,
with the frequent curse in his mouth and the
brown stain on his fingers, has to be chased
to the last extremity. But when he is cap-
tured, after a long race, and regularly
washed and bugged, and has his hair cut and
his cigarette supply stopped, and is well fed,
and made to stick out his chest in the light
of Heaven, and do vigorous exercise, the re-
sults are marvellous. Even in a couple of
weeks the improvement of Slouch, junior, is
often beyond belief. Still there are big diffi-
culties, for when young Slouch is in the pre-
liminary stages _ of his detention on Swan
Island, and is in anguish for want of his
little paper-and-tobacco abomination* it is
about as difficult to keep him from smuggling
in cigarettes as it is to tear an opium fiend
from his drug. Curiously enough it is said
that young Slouch, the military defaulter
in N.S.W., hasn’t quite so gross a craving
for cigarettes as his unseemly brother down
South, but has an extra desire for beer to
make up. In other respects—his ambling
gait, and his dirt, and his hair, and his ten-
dency to flop against some fixed object—he
and his Melbourne relative are alike. And
there is the same capacity for improvement
when the arm of Authority has washed him,
and put him in clean clothes, and taught him
the goose-step which is for the incipient
pushite the beginning of orderly citizenship.
«
From W. T. Moss, secretary of the Animals’
Protection Society, Sydney :
Another shocking spectacle was witnessed at Flem-
ington Siding yesterday (Feb. 5), when a stock train
arrived from the West. This train was three hours
late, and the owner of the sheep in two of the trucks
will have some cause for complaint. One of our
inspectors was present when the sheep were removed.
The unfortunate animals were so weak from the rough
treatment they had received on the journey that
some difficulty was experienced in detraining them,
and dogs were sent into the trucks over the sheep’s
backs to eject them. Ten sheep were dead in two
trucks; some of them were almost devoid of wool,
and must have been dead over 48 hours. They were
swollen and decomposed. Nine others, in a mangled
and dying condition, were dragged out on to the
siding, and there left in the scorching and swelter-
ing sun from 11 o’clock in the morning until three
o’clock in the afternoon, when I put them out of
their misery, I adopted this course because I was
informed by the carter who removes the dead sheep
that any animal showing any sign of life would be
removed to the abattoirs by the contractor, to be
used for human consumption. The Inspector of the
Meat Industry and Abattoirs Board has been for
some time engaged in killing all dying and mutilated
sheep after their removal from the trucks, and was
so engaged during the nie'ht previous and early morn-
ing, when his duty ended. The state of the law is
such that our Society is almost helpless to cope with
these eases of cruelty, and prosecute with any hope of
success. The sooner it. is altered the better.
The facts regarding the appalling cruelty to
stock in transit and during and immediately
after derailment at Flemington are indisput-
able. The allegations have been proved right
up to the hilt. What is needed now is a set
of explicit proposals from the experts in this
matter to end the atrocities —so far as they
can be ended under a railway system whose
object has been to lead the whole traffic of a
State, live and otherwise, up to the narrow
bottle-neck of a single port, and push it
through somehow, anyhow.
♦ •
The question re the Victorian Closer Settle-
ment Board is not one as to whether it ought
to be dismissed without further ado, but as
to when its unfitness was first proved, and
why the long-time discredited body has man-
aged to exist all these years without being
impeached in Parliament. The Watt
Government is neither more nor less to blame
for the scandalous operations of the Closer
Settlement land buyers and allotters than
previous Governments. Every old member
of the Vic. State Parliament stands con-
victed of responsibility for the Board’s mis-
deeds in the past. The first revelation in the
press of the fact that large sums of good
money had been paid for bad land dates
back to long ago. The cruel disappointment
of the earliest closer settlers is now an
ancient story. But the same old system
went on unchecked whilst matters of minor
importance were taken up and dropped (as
a rule), by the crowd of party politicians.
The'Lands Department must always have
been intimately acquainted with the work-
ings of the Closer Settlement Board of Con-
trol, yet the truth, or some of the truth
about the Board’s amazing land purchases
and want of business capacity never leaked
qut until the Watt Government’s commit-
tee of inquiry published a damning report a
fortnight ago. At the back of the discredited
C.S. Board is the notoriously rotten Lands
Department. It seems that no new Board
can effect thoroughly satisfactory reforms
in the Closer Settlement system until Par-
liament has reformed the Department, where
each transient Minister in turn is made to
appear incapable.
♦
Much may be forgiven to Victoria’s remark-
able magistrate, Read Murphy, for his vig-
orous pronouncement in the case of a drill-
shirking cadet who had a Quaker in court to
sneak for him: “I have no time for a boy
who talks nonsense about conscientious ob-
jections,” said 11. Murphy. Probably it was
the Quaker friend who made Murphy feel
“stuffy.” If the Quakers would settle down
largely in Mexico, Turkey,' Persia and such
like countries, where the Government is weak
and the protecting arm of an irreligious sol-
diery is shortened, and demonstrate the
workable character of their policy of non-
resistance amid real dangers, the world would
begin to take them seriously. There are good
business inducements to lead them to such
countries. In a fertile but troubled land,
where political unrest is the chief bar to
progress, magnificent chances lie before the
man who —by reason of his bright smile and
his broad brim and his faith and his “thee”
and his “thou” —is proof against trouble. A
non-military Quaker has no better chances
in England or the United States than any-
body else, but in Asiatic Turkey, assuming
that there is anything in his doctrines, he
might be a great boom and a bright and
noticeable light. It is the Quaker’s rigid
aversion to places where his views would
have a fair show that makes the unregener-
ate scoff at him. He is a gun with an in-
scription attached to it: “Thi« is an Infalli-
ble Weapon, but it Must Not be Fired
because it Will Burst.”
The N.S.W. Labor Conference, at the bid-
ding of Delegate Blakely (A.W.U.), de-
clared for a straight-out campaign against
syphilis. One woman-delegate, who was
especially effective, cited a case where a
mother was infected by her son’s kiss, and
demanded that the male “unfortunate” be
treated the same as the female “unfortu-
nate.” Another speaker declared that
women were interested on selfish grounds—
first to guard themselves, then to guard
their children, and last but greatest duty of
all, to guard the race from a preventable
horror, worse than any other infective hor-
ror known to man. The 1914 N.S.W. con-
ference of Labor-rulers was worth while if
only for this bold declaration, and the
Holman crowd had better hustle its slow-
moving Minister Flowers if it doesn’t want
its own directors to presently stamp right
over it in sheer exasperation.
Judge Rogers, of N.S.W., last week sympa-
thetically described “two-up” as “a perfectly
fair game,” and then, like a fair-minded man,
made things as easy as he possibly could for
some unfortunate pupil of a raided academy
who had appealed against his police-court
conviction for playing an unlawful game.
The Law is a worse thistle-eater than usual
where gambling is concerned —and all life is
made up of gambles. It never bursts into a
high-class club in search of gamblers, nor
breaks up Mrs. Midgeley-Blatters’ bridge
afternoon, and tramples the best china to
death in an effort to reform the Best People.
The land-agent who advertises a low-
lying swamp “beautiful park land” is
allowed to work his swindle uproariously.
Mrs. Insufficient Nourishment, the baby
adopter (on a financial basis) plays the game
of “one down” for keeps in the columns of
the respectable Liberal press, and never a
helmet looks over her backyard fence or the
front counter of the evil rag that prints her
sinister advertisement. The discolored alien
in search of a fool girl-theatrical to act (or
otherwise —mostly otherwise) in the un-
drained and miscalled “East” tries his very
private little game in the same way, and even
when some policeman “moves,” or rolls over
in bed. it is done very gradually and after
considerable reflection. Then the rogue-
politician, who has an elevated swindle of his
own, libels the land that keeps him alive—or
all that part of it in which he not directly
interested. Even marriage, with which the
Law frequently fools and interferes, is very
often a swindle of the worst description.
Really, when one comes to stand off and
view the matter in all its aspects, “two up”
seems to be the only fair game on the list.
“Vagabond,” from an English shipyard :
“A III.,” writing of the last naval manoeuvres here
in British iced-waters, concludes from the cables
that the submarines were so destructive that they
were called off the job before they burst the big ships
and spoiled the war-play. I wonder the cable didn’t
blush to twist the facts so. Actually the sub-
marines were severely handicapped and in many cases
were adjudged “out of action” by the scouting of
the aeroplanes. A submarine under water and in-
visible from a ship or shore is perfectly plain to the
vision of the flying man; and time “ after time a
’plane was able to spot the sub. sneaking out on
the battleships, and by signalling its whereabouts
enabled the warship to drop a spouting whirlpool of
shells on top of the underwater craft. The exploding
of a few dozen shells from a 13in. gun in the
waters, round, under and over the submerged craft,
is not conducive to their health or happiness, and
the judges, at any rate, promptly ruled out the theor-
etically bombarded ones.
“A ITT ” says, again, that the result of the war-
game shifted the bogey of invasion off J. Bull’s
chest. On the contrary, it demonstrated that invasion
was a simple matter. Desnite the larger defending
fleet, the attackers were able to land armed parties,
destroy (in theory) important ports and railwav
depbts, coal, stores, oil and other etceteras—all
under close watch of the judges, who clocked off the
movements of the landing parties, and made them
take such time as the actual operations would have
eaten up. The common and accepted belief here was
that the maribsuvres were hurriedly closed down
because the success of the invasion was a proof of the
Australia’s Greatest Statesman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Prime Minister (Mr. Joseph Cook), on
arriving home yesterday from Canberra: “I went to
see what was going on there. It was several years
since I was last there, and very great changes have
taken place since then.... I was very pleased with
all I saw. It is to be very much wished that more
of our members will run up and see whac '; taking
place. There have been some little troubles there,
incidental to camp life—difficulties in obtaining water
in sufficient quantities. Personally, I have very great
sympathy with the men, who are being put to so
much inconvenience.”
’Twas Australia’s Greatest Statesman —and
his other name was Cook —
Who informed the dazed reporter that he’d
been to have a look
At “the Capital”—Stoneberra—whfere the
dust storms do their sprints—
It was years ago he’d seen it, and, there’d
been some changes since.”
Then that bold and bad reporter, in his bold
reporter’s way,
Asked Australia’s Greatest Statesman if he’d
generously say
Where and why and what great changes had
occurred to move him so;
Was the dear, old pub still standing? And
that Statesman answered “No!”
“1 believe they have a railway?” said that
bold reporter, next;
“Oh, they have,” replied the Statesman; “I
will take it as my text.
It’s a very charming railway, or it will be
when it’s done;
And it comes straight into Sydney, where all
railways ought to run !
“At the moment —you’ll believe me—though
it isn’t finished, quite,
I can confidently answer that the railway is
all right;
For the survey is completed, and the track
is being laid,
Though the route is rather dusty and there
isn’t too much shade.”
“How about the rocks and mountains, and
the gritty paddocks there?”
(Then inquired that bold reporter with a
mild, persuasive air).
“Er — oh—rcr-r-ah, yes ; exactly!” said the
Statesman; “through the dust
I just saw them* still : they’ll be
there —of cofirse, they must!”
“And the site- —is that still standing?” asked
the pressman. “Yes, indeed!
All the roads and parks and buildings still
exist upon the screed;
And they’re laying pipes and fountains, and
they’re excavating tanks,
And I couldn’t tell you what-all, such as fac-
tories and banks.
“And they’re planning great skyscrapers for
the papers—when thev start;
Papers which will move the rabbits and
gohannas to the heart!
And they’ve got huge lakes and rivers on the
Plan they showed to me;
And, although there is no grass there, I am
told they have a tree.”
“Heavens!” cried that bold reporter; “I
must really put that down !”
(Here he scribbled “ Splendid timber — trees
to ornament the town.)
While the Statesman smiled serenely, and
remarked, “A gum- tree too;
Though they never named the species—red
or white or green or blue.”
“And” (continued the reporter) “how about
the weather there?”
Said the Statesman, looking thoughtful, “It
was—well—er —only fair ;
For, you see, it was mid-summer, and the
sun was very hot:
Still, I don’t think I should say so—No;
perhaps you’d better not!”
“Any rain?” (asked that reporter, as he felt
for a fresh pad),
“Not exactly,” said the Statesman, “though
they need it very bad :
Say—er— dew fell last September—yes, I
think if I were you.
And your editor would like it, I’d say, ‘Some
nights there is dew.’ ”
“But, great Caesar!” yelled the pressman
in the accents of despair,
“If there’s neither rain nor moisture, what
the devil is there there?”
“Hush!” remarked the Great Man sadly;
“you won’t go to Kingdom Come!”
“Well, what do they do for water?” But
the Statesman he Was dumb.

need of a stronger British navy for defence, and the
Liberal Government doesn’t hanker for any more
arguments in favor of the Big Navy views.
I agree that Australia would find submarines useful
in case of an invasion, but I believe a fleet of air-
craft would be invaluable. The invader’s ships would
certainly cart along a number of the underwater
craft, and they’d play Old Henry with our fleet if
we have no ’planes to pick them out and drop a
few explosive bricks on top of them. If a final
argument is required of the value of the ’planes, it
can be found in the programme that was in full
operation within a month of the end of the navy
manoeuvres—a circle of shore stations are to be estab-
lished, orders were placed with private firms for
’planes, and so on. It was immediately laid down by
responsible Ministers that Britain must establish the
largest and best air-fleet in Europe; and Bull is
bogging in hard to do so.
The “Living Wage.”
Justice Heydon, of N.S.W., lias issued a
sort of verdict about the cost of living, but
he hasn’t thereby done much good for the
world. The most important feature of his
finding is that a family of one man, his wife
(one wife) and two children aged under 14
can live in a house of three rooms and a
kitchen on a wage of 48s. per week. And at
present rents and prices they probably can
—bar accidents and incidents. But suppos-
ing there were four children under 14, and
considering the way the allegedly insufficient
birth-rate is talked about there certainly
ought to be four! And there might easily,
without discredit, be six. That knocks out
the estimate as regards the board bill and
the size of the house at one blow. When
you make allowance for chronic bachelors
and spinsters, and childless couples, and
married people who die after the first child
is born, and children who die and leave the
home empty, the idea of taking two parents
and two children as a sort of average for
those homes which are really helping along
the population is absurd. It would mean a
steady perishing of the race. And apart
from the absurdly small size of the pro-
posed house and family there are the acci-
dents and incidents as already mentioned
The world is full of them. They are more
numerous thpii dust-boxes. And they
cost a lot of money. A margin must
be left for sickness and death and burial,
and periods of unemployment, and for old
age, and an occasional drink, and an occa-
sional trip, and some occasional amusement,
and Santa Claus once a year, and possibly
some contribution to the support of what
Benno, Henry Lawson’s dweller in Elder
Man’s Lane, called the Old ’Uns. Also some
men have a hobby which costs a little; it
ismt .everybody who can extract sufficient
amusement for his spare hours out of a
street corner and a post. For a family of
four boiler-metal people who were proof
against all hazards and possibilities, and
who lived in a boiler-metal world that never
varied or went wrong, 48s. a week would
doubtless be a living wage of a sort. Civili-
sation wouldn’t improve at the price. Yet
it might not die out. But in a shambling,
haphazard, bow-legged planet which is fiill
of chances a surplus is required. If the
housefather fell over a dog on the doorstep
on a dark night it might upset all Mr.
lleydon’s calculations for six' months. Let
his Honor multiply the number of house-
fathers bv the number of dogs, and the re-
sult by the number of doorsteps, and that
result by the number of dark nights, and
then, even after he has deducted the number
of places where the dog might be instead
of on the doorstep and the number of times
the house-father might not come out after
dark, the result will probably make him re-
consider his ‘‘living wage”—and also feel
ashamed of it.
BiLrA' B.” : This aviation business frazzles
me. I used to think that the flying man sat
on his machine, touched over the lever, ran
a , w , y a . r< f s along any old piece of reason-
ably level ground, and then hiked skyward.
But I was wrong. S. M. Herald has ex-
plained things. Observe:—
About a year ago Senator Pearce imported three
aeroplanes of the Bristol type. Thev were brought
to Sydney because it was honed to establish a Com-
monwealth flying ground in New South Wales. For
various reasons the rarity of the atmosphere was one
—the Government was advised not to select a site
m New South IVales, but to look for one in Victoria.
Eventually a site suitable for a flying - ground was
chosen in the vicinity of Altona Bay and Werribee.
A|id, of course; when brother Nogi is incon-
siderate enough to start walloping his war
drum up North, Australia will be at a devil
of a disadvantage by reason of the difficulty
in transporting the vicinity of Altona Bav
and Werribee to Darwin or thereabouts, and
the delay in gathering sufficient of the right
brand of atmosphere in its carpet-bag to
float the air scouts on arrival. I suppose
the end of it will be we will have to fall
back on a couple of black trackers and an
air-bloodhound to watch Nogi, or else send a
trained crow after him.
In a recent issue of The Billboard (published in
Cincinnati. U.S.) the editor announces his firm
conviction of the “saving grace of truth” in regard
to show criticism, and says The Billboard will
have it or drop anchor. Over the page his Australian
correspondent reports: “Gene Green and the Prim-
rose Four will so far have to be handed the docket
that they have been the two greatest successes that
the Rickards people have ever had from .the other
side of the world.”

♦
“Diplomacy,” the modernised version of
Sardou’s “Dora,” is a snail-like society melo-
drama, with a plan of a British dockyard
instead of the usual corpse. The Julius
Knight Co., which produced the resurrected
play at Sydney Royal, last Saturday, does a
fair amount of justice to the good things that
are mostly not provided amidst scenery and
mountings that are really admirable, and the
audience (the patience of the Australian
audience is sublime or ridiculous, according
to the way you look at it) waits like a flock
of pastured sheep for the first big situation,
which happens at 9.45 precisely. On Satur-
day evening a man who had an appointment
at the painfully brief boxing match of the
week at the Stadium, and who had to leave
the theatre after the opening ten minutes,
got back at 9.40 and straightway understood
how far the play had moved without a word
of explanation. In the intervening hour and
a half, the ‘‘action'' had moved just about as
far as one could throw a tramcar by hand.
Even to accomplish that the diplomats of
the play have to be represented as next door
to half-witted —at least the younger of them
has to be that way all the time, and the elder
is a complete ass till the last act, when his
sense of smell suddenly becomes as acute as
a bloodhound’s. Then he follows the heavily
scented trail of the lurid Comtesse Zicka over
his documents in a way that would put the
best dog to shame and cause it to hold its
brow with one paw. As most people know, the
blessed plan is stolen from the younger dip-
“ON THE SCENT ”
IN “DIPLOMACY
AT SYDNEY
ROYAL.
Julius Knight dispenses with bloodhounds by
proving, with his keen nasal organ , that the
scented lurker (Irene Browne) is guilty of
larceny.
lomatist’s despatch box on his wedding day
by the jealous Zicka, and slipped by her
into a friendly note which Dora, the bride,
sends at her (Zicka’s) instigation to old
Baron Stein, the foreman-spy who wasn’t
invited to the diplomatic wedding and given
the run of the place. This is the cne notice-
able streak of sanity in the diplomatic pro-
ceedings. As hinted above, the elder diplo-
matist gets on the trail in the last act
through the thieving Zicka’s use of a pecu-
liar scent, and forces her to confess in a
more or less broken-up condition. The plan
having been recovered previously by a
straight-out demand on Baron Stein, there
isn’t as much sting in the end as there might
be,
Julius Knight, as Henry Beauclerc, the
elder diplomatist, is suave and reposeful.
Martin Lewis, as Julian 8., the worried
young diplomatist brother, looks the part
but appears to suffer from a chronic inabil-
ity to portray deep emotion. The same re-
mark applies to Miss Irene Brown (Com-
tesse Zicka), who droops and lingers very
artistically, but can’t squeeze a stage tear.
Hers is a hopelessly melodramatic part. She
stresses the fact by her sensational gowning
and her particular manner of lurking watch-
fully up-stage. But it really doesn’t matter
much, and she is highly decorative. Also,
when she lurks, her fine eyes are seen to the
best advantage. Leslie Victor, as Baron
Stein, is in a part where it is expected of
him to be villainously conventional, but he
gives it an artistic flick where possible.
Arthur Greenaway is too restrained as the
hunted and insulted and generally bumped
Orloff. Lizette Parkes, as the innocent
Dora, is delightfully fresh and dainty, but
a little overweighted by the tragedy of the
misunderstood bride. Emma Temple is an
alert, genial and very human Marquise de
Rio-/ares, who would disarm most creditors
without trouble. Eily Malyon gives a
sprightly imitation of a shrill, chattering
French maid as the delighted Australian
audience understands such characters. And
Mrs. Brough, as Lady Henry Fairfax, sup-
plies some sparkling comedy moments. The
absence of Lady Henry from the later scenes
is greatly to be deplored. It is a complete
and interesting production and above the
average as regards mounting.
«!• *i»
“Officer 666” will resign from the force
stationed at Sydney Criterion this week, in
order to make room for another of these
slick American comedies, the name of which
does not really matter, since they are all the
same.
Hugh Buckler and his co. at the Little
Theatre, Sydney, still keep “Ilis House in
Order. ’ The mansion is not capsized or in-
verted, nor is the tenement torn in two pieces
and tottering at an angle of 45 degrees. The
fly that walks upside down on the ceiling
finds the ceiling in its usual place, and the
spider on the wall isn’t disturbed by any
upheavals. The play embodies a powerful
warning to every man’s second wife. She
should have it: specified in the marriage set-
tlement that the first wife, being dead, must
stay dead; that being buried she must re-
main buried; that her alleged perfections
must not *be thrown up at her successor;
and that her relations must not pervade
the house and eat the victuals and say what
a pity it is that the tidy and immaculate
predecessor is gone. In this respect Henry
VIII. was a wise bigamist. When he exe-
cuted a wife he chased all her family connec-
tions right across the horizon, and started
afresh.
After an extra blow-out on Tuesday in
aid of the Actors’ Benevolent Fund, the
White City of Sydney has settled down to
its regular habits, or as many regular habits
as it has acquired in the way of providing
diversion. Calvert continues to walk across
a cobweb in the stars or thereabouts, and
the hundred' side-shows not weary in
well doing.
Since The Bulletin remarked last time
it blusliingly appeared on the Block that the
programme at the National Amphitheatre
(Sydney) deserved the support of amuse-
ment-seekers nothing has occurred to in-
culcate repentance in its mind. The pro-
gramme is sprinkled with strong turns, and
the weak turns afford an admirable oppor-
tunity to go out and subscribe to the fund
for the relief of the famine in Japan.
As threatened last week, William Ander-
son’s American Burlesque Company at the
Palace revived “The Speculators,” and Syd-
ney crowded as much of itself into the build-
ing as possible. The rest of it stayed out-
side and uttered execrations re its exclusion.
The show is a sort of twin or triple
brother to “The Grafters” and “A Day at
the Races.” It is light and airy, and there
are dances and persiflage in it. A certain
tendency on the part of somebody to kiss
somebody else by the light of the moon is
manifest in places. Any individual of robust
intelligence may observe traces of a Bowery
or Blink.v Bill element, without which no
play dealing with New York or thereabouts
is complete. To-morrow week will be the last
appearance of a co. that has made a lot of
friends, and if it has made any enemies
they haven’t been identified at this office.
Australian-born Hawker, one of the flying
men of the world, will make his first public
flight above Sydney on Saturday from Rand-
wick racecourse at three o’clock, and manager
M. J. Bloomfield guarantees that, bar acci-
dents, the time will be adhered to. Hawker
is a mere youngster of 22. and his principal
vice, from a show point of view, is a hatred
of publicity. He has never “sat” for a
photograph, such photos of him as are in
existence having been “snapped” by news-
paper men, whom he loves with a blown-in-
the-bottle resentment. Another cherished
detestation is the person who offers a
weighty bank-note attached to an advertise-
ment to be pasted or painted on his ’plane.
On a recent occasion, when his manager
lovingly rolled the bank-note before him,
Hawker is alleged to have foamed at the pro-
peller. Likewise, he is chary about the
species of passengers he carries, and will
onlv make appointments after an interview
with the prospective cargo. The reason is
that the cargo is stowed beside him, not be-
hind, where it could fall out comfortably,
and if it has a tendency to become excited
or infuriated it may take charge of the
bridge, to the daiager and great annoy-
ance of the pilot, xvt time of writing about
40 aspiring birds had made application to
chance Hawker’s critical eye. After Sydney,
he will probably make flights at Newcastle
and Bathurst.
“ THE WEARING OF THE
GREEN," AT MEL-
BOURNE PRINCESS'S.
Finnegan , the doorkeeper. Fitzgerald , the Squire.
The Sydney Adelphi got out of its panto-
mime stockings on Saturday, scraped the
rust and cobwebs off its gun, and “came
back,” more or less successfully, with “The
Pride of the Prairie.” One needn’t have put
the X-rays on the title to guess that the
bellowdrama would be full of Indians and
cowboys, witli a half-breed to cause trouble,
most likely. The lirst scene is full of promise.
Great Storm, an Indian chief, upset at his
daughter keeping company with a half-
Spanisli rancher, threatens her with deatli
so successfully that she loses the power of
speech. Then, instead of trying his luck on
the rest of the co., he inconsiderately stops
short —apparently waiting for this paper to
offer him a bonus of 7s. (id. h head to treat
several others in the same way. After that
disappointment “The Tripe of the Prairie”
takes the line of least resistance, and, pro-
ceeding through numerous plots and counter-
plots, captures, escapes and murders, winds
up with the same old promised marriage,
while a funeral or two get ready in the
background. The scenery is, as usual, very
good, particularly in some of the Indian
scenes, in one of which, for the first time,
Adelphi patrons have the pleasure of seeing
a suspected Indian lynched. Cyril Mackay,
as Dick the Britisher, succeeds in being
exactly the same hero as he has been several
hundred times before; and Miss Gertrude
Boswell, a new arrival, makes a very good
impression as Clattering Kate, the pride of
the prairie. Miss Muriel Dale (the wronged
female), Max Clifton (Great Storm, the
Indian), and Vivian Edwards (Carlos
Durango, the half-bred scoundrel), all re-
ceive honorable mention. As for most of the
others, on second thoughts the bonus will be
increased to 10s. 6‘d.
But for the reappearance of Lily Eyton,
a comedienne who called for a certain amount
of praise when she was here before, and
artist Eric Stone, who didn’t call for so
much, the Sydney Tivoli programme 'is
much the same as it was last week. That
is, the most interesting items are supplied bv
the Two Bobs, the Tom Davis Trio of
motor-cyclists, Waterbury Bros, and Tenney,
baritone Talleur Andrews, dancers Vivien
Talleur and Margaret Klos, and Salma
Braatz.
The best of this week’s moving pictures in
Svdney:—
Crystal Palace: “Her Majesty the Little Queen.”
wherein a queenlet refuses to sign certain death-
warrants because her tutor’s name is on the black-
list. Understood to be a dark hint at Alice Wilkins
in this somewhere.
Lyric : “The Parasites,” concerning the financial
affairs of a pair of blackmailers and the domestic
worries of the society gentleman to whom they are
looking for dividends. Lady partner makes a death-
bunk confession, and the co. goes bung.
Colonial : “Within the Enemy’s Lines,” yet
another Yankee Civil War film, teeming with all the
horrors of a moving-picture campaign.
Empress: “The Pitfall,” dealing with the dangers
that await the innocent geurl who goes on the stage,
especially when the stage-manager isn’t otherwise
engaged.
West’s Glaciarium and Olympia : For the rest
of the week, “Honesty.” Next week, Asta Neilsen,
who has been recovering from a hunger-strike, will
reappear in “Suffragette.” Police arrangements are
in the hands of the Inspector-General.
Spencer’s Lyceum : Last nights of “A Message
from Mars.” On Friday night, picture of the
America-N.S.W. athletics, with a lecture by manager
Peixotto.
Imperial : “The Trail of the Hanging Rock,” a
Canadian story of derring-do or something.
The revue is nearing the three months
mark at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, and the
populace still crowds to it with something
that is either enthusiasm or a pretence there-
at which constitutes dashed good acting.

The foregoing ample statement of the
plot of “Joseph and His Brethren” will ex-
plain to everybody not wholly unacquainted
with Holy Writ that the large and pic-
turesque drama at Melb. Royal is less Bibli-
cal than sensational. It takes many liberties
with the only authorised history of Joseph,
especially as regards Mrs. Potiphar, who sins
with all the enthusiasm of the worst woman
in London. The prominence given to Mrs.
P. by the dramatist throws a heavy respon-
sibility upon Miss Ethel Warwick. Miss
Warwick, speaking frankly, has neither a
musical voice nor a forceful personality.
Her appearance is the only really striking
feature of her performance. The Joseph
(Malcolm Tearle) is pleasing but not
powerful, whilst some of the other people—•
newly imported or otherwise —do nothing
that lives in one’s recollection through a
play of four acts and 13 scenes, with con-
siderable pauses between scenes. Satur-
day’s performance, doubtless, will be bet-
tered during this week, not to mention the
weeks thereafter. First impressions were
most favorable to Edward O’Neill as Simeon
(an excellent actor in each of his scenes),
Frank Harvey as Potiphar, Henry Hallam
as Judah, with one long, effective speech to
deliver, and George Bryant as elder brother
Reuben, he being about the only member of
the co., bar Simeon, who looks his part very
impressively, and carries a Biblical atmo-
sphere about with him. The scenery is good,
but not startlingly beautiful, and the final
tableau would be quite brilliant in its way
if Father Jacob produced a solemn effect
on the beholder. Perhaps The Bulletin’s
beholder expected too much of the inspired
founder of the Cohen family.
This is the ninth week of the panto, at
Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), where Mr. and
*?Mrs. Baba will continue to appropriate
property with impunity until further
notice. Also it is the same week of the
“Land of Nod” at the King’s, where a
change of bill is impending. The Bert
Bailey combination takes the floor at the
King’s on Saturday (21st), with “The
Ninety and Nine.” Melbourne has heard
satisfactory accounts of this drama from
Sydney, and will accept the bush-fire scene
as a seasonable attraction. On Tuesday
next week C. R. Stanford is to have the
use of the King’s for a matinee benefit per-
■ formance, the details whereof will be duly
announced.
“THE WEARING OF THE GREEN,” AT
MELBOURNE PRINCESS'S.
A snap from the audience.
At Melbourne Rrincess’s for the past
10 nights artless young Allen Doone, in ver-
dure clad, has been playing “The Wearing of
the Green,” and breathing a fond message
to the Irish in a voice much impaired by a
recent cold. Probably due to this affliction
he reduces his singing to a minimum, and on
one or two evenings has preferred to patter
rather than to warble the sintiments that
bring large lumps into pathriotic throats.
Miss Edna Keeley, who is alleged to have
been indisposed by day but sufficiently re-
covered by night to portray the usual colleen,
has rendered useful assistance in the good
work; and a company, including Messrs.
Buckley and Cullenane and Miss Ethel Grist,
has dutifully pretended to be torn by
emotion. An improved Doone and a con-
valescent Miss Keeley are expected to attract
the coin of the faithful in “The Rebel” to be
produced next Saturday night. In this
play, which is the sole novelty in Doone’s
job lot of dramas, James B. Fagan presents
his views on the trying times of ’9B.
The present Melbourne Opera House bill
is embellished by the talent of Josephine
Davis, who employs a nice voice and an un-
pretentious manner on some of Irving
Berlin’s song successes. All of her ditties
she renders acceptably enough, but achieves
the best results with “In My Harem,” a
cute song of Yiddish character wherein she
is probably most herself. The Richards and
Pasquali brethren earn full approval for
their gymnastic doings, but Barton and Ash-
ley’s new turn seems too protracted and
piffling for Opera House consumption. Also
present are the clever Romanos with the
beauteous muscular appointments; the talka-
tive Du Calion, whose turn might be called
“The Tower of Babel”; and one James
Eraser, who is charged with the deplorable
distinction of being “Australia’s champion
ragtime singer.”
** * *
The Dandies continue to improve on ac-
quaintance in their specially constructed
residence on the St. Ivilda (Vic.) Esplanade.
Claude Dampier gives songs and character
sketches with a humor that combines the
robust effects of a knockabout with some of
the graces of a light comedian. Gavin Wood,
baritone, is pleasing; Oliver Peacock, the
buxom tenor, sets flappers demanding his pic-
ture postcard ; and the three charming ladies
seem to be worthy of their exceptional
salaries. Some people also find George Mor-
gan diverting, though there are probably
many things in life to be preferred to
George’s little pleasantries and curate-like
cavortings. This critic would sooner have a
glass of' milk.
Chief among the attractions at Melbourne
Olympic on Saturday was “A Prisoner in the
Ilarem, ’ a strip of Indian bellowdram'a con-
taining a bad old Sultan and a man-eating
tiger. These animals collaborate to make
life exciting for the sweet young heroine.
“Two Aristocratic Penitents” and “A Hus-
bands Awakening” which also started, were
both dull sermons for giddy husbands, and
declared that female worship, like Charity,
should begin at home. Next Saturday
Spencer is starring “The Story of a Siren,”
a pretty Pathe drama.
Prom a Bulletin man’s point of view:—
If Australia possesses a theatre suitable-for Tango
lea parties, it is not in Melbourne. The first Tango
attraction at the Opera House drew a crowd whose
curiosity, in most cases, was fully satisfied by this
sample of the entertainment provided. The air of
social gathering was lacking. In the stalls and d.c.,
where refreshments are provided as part of the
entertainment, the wedged-in condition of the audi-
ence gives no scope for comfortable “discussion” of
the tea and cake, or spoonful of iced material, that
comes along. Therefore the refreshments count for
practically nothing on the bill of fare, and the
Tangio display on the stage is a matter for cold-
blooded criticism. Two or three selected vaudeville
turns are sandwiched between demonstrations of
Tango and Turkey Trot by a pair of capable (but
unremarkable) young practitioners and some slow,
unstately processions of girls who are deputed to
exhibit gowns, hats and undergarments. The dancing
is educational (as the Le Brun turn was) to any
earnest student of Tango steps and Turkey trots;
also, it is interesting on account of its claim to be
beyond Wowserian reproach. George Salinger cheer-
fully informs the audience that he is about to show
how groundless are the charges of impropriety brought
against Turkey trotting in ordinary. And then he
and the 3’oung, lady proceed, in a respectable and
matter-of-fact manner, to justify all that Wowser
has ever said concerning the possibilities of the
steps. The Tango, danced by experts, may be passed
at the Customs without demur ; but the artists who
can persuade a reasonable audience that a full-fledged
Turkey Trot is nothing for anybody to snort at have
not yet revealed their purpose in Australia. So much
for the dancing. As to the processions of girl in
dress and undress, the only objection is their long-
drawn-out ungracefulness. The ladies in prehistoric
costumes are obviously ill at ease. They haven’t
learned the business of making stage exhibits of
themselves in easy, show-room style. The girls who
serve as advts. for somebody’s corsets are as pleasing
as they ought to be under the circumstances ; but the
damsels doomed to march along the gangway in
drooping bloomers seem conscious of their uncalled-
for behavior. The bloomers are not at all shocking.
They, are merely saddening. No man can rejoice in
the thought that the woman he loves is required by
fashion to be arrayed like one of these. The long,
drooping, saggy bloomers of Tango Tea ladies drive
thoughts of love clean out of his head. He goes
away in a monastic frame of mind.
Adelaide shows are mostly dominated by
the weather. The Dandies are outdoors,
with the exhibition to fall back on in case of
rain. Wondergraph keeps on its North
Terrace open-air stand, as well as its big
new home. The Tivoli shows the quaint
Ferry Corwey, with the Schmettans, Bellora,
the Rexos, and the rest, down at the Oval,
but on Saturday nights opens the Grote-
street house as well. West’s, on the other
hand, are indoors with Forbes-Robertson’s
filmed Hamlet, to the Ophelia of Gertrude
Elliott. And the King’s manages (o
keep cool enough with the “maniac” bull-
dogs, the gymnastic Benos, the reckless
“Juno Salmo,” and other strong Brennan-
Fuller turns.
“Harrison O.”: The chief effect of a first-night in-
spection of “Joseph and His Brethren” is to immensely
increase one’s respect for the late Moses, or whoever
it was, who originally told the story of how Joe
the Nark made himself unpopular, first with his
brothers, and, later, with Mrs. Potiphar. He put his
tale in a few pithy chapters. Louis Parker unfolds
his narrative in 13 scenes, with the aid of 45 named
characters and a host of supers; so that the scenery
synopsis looks like a slab of the “World’s Gazetteer”
and the cast of characters like a page of the “Post
Office Directory.” Nearly every incident is hedged
round with superfluous dialogue, and incidents that
have already been witnessed by those in the audi-
torium are narrated by some of those on the stage,
for the benefit of other characters on the stage who
happened to be away when the thing occurred. For
a comparatively interesting, reasonably sub-edited
yarn, give me Genesis every time.
From London: Beerbohm Tree has closed the run
of “Joseph and His Brethren” at His Majesty’s after
the 150th performance. “Many of the leading lights
of the Church have given it their blessing,” he says;
yet he has no hope that there will be much of a
crop from the Biblical ground now opened up—the
Lord Chamberlain stands in the way. Anyhow,
Tree switches off on to a revival of an old success,
“The Darling of the Gods,” with Marie Lohr as
Yo San. “She has revealed at rehearsals,” says Tree,
“a depth of intensity of tragic feeling for which I
was hardly prepared.”
JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dreamer Joseph, son of Rachel, wore a
many colored coat;
Which his father placed upon him his im-
portance to denote,
Whereat the sons of Israel expressed their
deep concern,
For Joseph was a younger son with brether-
ing to burn.
Do! Six of them were Leah’s lot and Zilpah
claimed two more,
And brothers Dan and Naphtali were two
that Bilhah bore;
Of all the sons of Israel was Joe the young-
est Yid,
Save Rachel’s last and final —little Ben-
jamin, the Kid.
On a sheep-run near to Dothan, lo ! it fate-
fully befell
That Joseph’s jealous brothers dropped the
Dreamer down a well;
And the dried-up well of Dothan might have
proved his silent grave
Had not giddy minx Zuleika chanced to buy
him for a slave.
Ah ! the guilt of this Zuleika has been trum-
peted afar.
She is mentioned in the Scriptures as the
wife of Potiphar,
And any blushful Wowser for the very words
can vouch
Which she used to say to Joseph whilst re-
clining on a couch.
In the play she looks upon him and adores
the goodly youth ;
She chews his chilly shoulder and his chaste
unwilling mouth;
Then, having failed to tempt him to a co-
respondent’s fault,
She weeps, and charges Joseph with a
criminal assault.
They cast him into prison where the
Pharaoh’s servants lie,
And he tells his fellow captives what will
happen by-and-bye ;
But Zuleika still pursues him, and the audi-
ence is warned
That ll—l contains no fury like a she-
Fgyptian scorned.
Two famous eerie visions came to Pharaoh
in the night,
And his staff of fortune-tellers failed to
read his dreams aright;
So the monarch sent for Joseph, who was
quick to understand
That his Nibs must make provision for a
famine in the land.
And the King spake unto Joseph: “Prithee,
run the blessfed show
In the wisdom of thy purpose through the
years of weal and woe;
And whatsoe’er thou doest shall the law of
Egypt be,
For I set you up as ruler of the country—
after Me.”
Ripe corn was stored by Joseph whilst the
seasons yet were good,
Till the land waxed dry and dusty. Then he
doled the masses food.
And the squattahs pawned their acres, when
their “stuff” and stock were spent,
lo the good and wily Hebrew who controlled
the Government.
Hats off to Joe the Dreamer, who foresaw’
the rainless day,
And _ squeezed the drought-struck squattahs
in a crude Egyptian way ;
Who loved the State and labored to preserve
the public health !
M hen cometh such a Joseph to our careless
Commonwealth?
To purchase corn in Egypt came his brether-
ing with gold;
Yet they knew not gentle Joseph for the
brother they had sold.
1 hough he bade them bring him Benjamin.
and schemed some little schemes,
lhat all mieht come to happen in accordance
with his dreams.
Zuleika still pursued him in her fond un-
dying hate,
But Potiphar, the fathead, grew suspicious
of his mate;
He listened round the corner and he took
her by surprise
And he told his faithful minions to remove
the lady’s eyes.
Lo! All the sons of Israel to Joseph’s house
were brought,
And when they knew their brother they be-
haved as Jews distraught.
Reub, Simeon, Gad, Levi, Judah, Naphtali
and Dan,
Asher, Isaachar and Zebulun went dotty, to
a man.
And all the folk of Goshen rolled up,
friendly like, and cheered
When Jacob, alias Israel, in sudden nomp
appeared
Perched high upon a platform—like a pro-
phet out for larks,
Or a limelit personator of the recent Henry
Parkes.
VICTORIA.
O.K.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Private Boxer”: Died the other week in N’York
Wm. F. Hawtrey, familiarly known as “Bill.” He will
be remembered in Australia for many good character-
comedy parts. Glabrio, in “The Sign of the Cross,”
was the first, and probably the best, seen here. His
Tramp, too, in “A Message from Mars,” would take
a lot of beating. He made a lot of money in his
time—for bookies and poker-schools. His only sur-
viving brother is the popular Charles, who made a
fortune out of “The Private Secretary,” and lost it
in the family manner. He is at present playing the
part Niblo is to have in “Never Say Die.” “Never
Say Die” would very well stand for the motto of the
Hawtreys ; but no family is allowed to have the last
word in that matter. Bright’s disease was the thing
that concluded the argument in Bill’s case.
A MEMORY SKETCH.
After the show.
Irving Sayles as he used to be.
“Dumper”: There’s
a very persistent
rumor in Australian
film circles that
, Charles Spencer
steps off the direc-
torate of the Pic-
ture Combine. Pro-
bably his White
City venture occu-
pies all his time.
Spencer’s mantle
will fall on Haw-
kins, now manager
of the associated
exchanges, and the
man who engin-
eered the Combine.
Brother Hawkins is
a lay preacher, and
the Methodists
worked him into
the Spencer firm to
watch their inter-
ests in connection
with the Lyceum.
After floating the
original eon cern
into a limited com-
pany, he was left
in charge whilst
Spencer went round
the world. It was
then he saw the pos-
sibilities of a Com-
bine, and, feeling
round (not round and flabby through much food,
like Mr. Chadband, but feeling his way among his
professional brethren), he found the others quite
willing, the only trouble being as co the terms on
which the various parties should come in.
Albert (Waxman) Whelan, the Australian “enter-
tainer,” gets spoken to by London Sketch
(17/12/’l3) for his lack of variety in staging his
turn at the Palace. Back after an absence of some
years, he still “enters in dress-clothes, and divests
himself of his overcoat, hat and gloves, and whistles
a well-known air before getting to business. The
business consists of two topical songs, several good
stories, a French song with whistling refrain, and
an imitation of Chirgwin. At the end he sits down
to the piano just as the curtain falls, once again
whistling the old familiar tune.” As “the whole
thing was extremely well done, and went as well as
could possibly be hoped,” and as “the crowded
house was completely satisfied, and asked for nothing
more,” Whelan may possibly think that his way of
finishing a turn is still good enough.
Marcus, so long manager of Adelaide Tivoli for
Rickards and then for Mclntosh, has given up theat-
rical work to run as an electricity expert. His
first big work was an advertising sign of great size
and brilliance, and the Adelaide papers, in memory
of old times, gave it a glowing notice. It is “not
ingenious,” the Register said incidentally—and left
Marcus guessing whether “most ingenious” was in-
tended.
THE MUSICAL MAGSMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Slapoffski, the musical conductor, in an interview,
said that Australia and Maoriland, like other English
communities, were the prey of musical humbugs and
charlatans. “The best means of combating them,” he
declared, “is the establishment of municipal or
national conservatoriums for the purpose of cultivat-
ing the public taste. The publicity given by munici-
pal enterprises will kill* impostures.”
- —News from Wellington (il/.L.).
The musical magsman arrived in the South,
And honey and spices flowed out of his mouth ;
He came with a rote to a critic or two,
Who gaped and admired, as a critic should do ;
Oh, great was the glory and fine was the fun
When the public was doped by the musical gun !
He played a concerto and something in F ;
The “notice” was splendid—the critic was deaf;
He wagged the great mane on his leonine head —
“How perfectly lovely!” the pretty girls said;
And signing his name in their autograph book
Meant one-guinea seats for the musical crook.
He sang them a cycle of polyglot verse—
Hungarian, Finnish, Mongolian and Erse;
The praise in the press was unstintedly hot.
And nobody ventured to mutter, “Damn rot!”
The concert-promoter said, “Lord, what a swag!”
And fawned at the feet of the musical mag.
He said to himself in his moments of fright:
“Mein Gott, I haf vork for a guinea a nighdt!
I haf pawn my tress-goad in der days dot vos past,.
And dis is too himmlizeh —how long gan it last ?
Dose embryo beoples shoost grawling mit oof,
How long gan they shtant for der musical shpoof?”
The musical inag in his homeland will yearn
For the season when southward in joy he’ll return;
He’ll sigh, in his job at a fiver a week,
For the public that called him “supreme” and
“unique” ;
“I got to ged pack to id, von of dose days,
Vere der shtnff dot vos schlenter is music vot pays.”

“Full Astern” reports a new danger:—
The N.S.W. Navigation Department’s new regula-
tions about life-jackets and lifebuoys on ferry-
steainers in Port Jackson got an unexpected adver-
tisement one night last week when the Balmain
steamer Lady Rawson, on a moonlight excursion,
bumped into a motor-boat. The engine of the launch
broke down when off Dawes Point, and the craft,
without lights, drifted round the busiest corner in
the harbor. The ferry steamer did the rest, and
the launch sank like a petrified elephant. Five men
jumped into the water, and the excited passengers
on the picnic boat began to throw lifebuoys and life-
jackets after them. A collier, ambling along at this
juncture, also cast buoys and belts into the water
by the armful. Then the passing ferry Kirrule
heard that 10 men, a herd- of women, five orphan
children, a bald baby, a defaulting cashier and a
bigamist were struggling in the water and began
energetically to empty whole stacks of cork life-
savers upon the troubled sea. Meanwhile two
athletic heroes on the Rawson plunged into the water.
When they found their man he was swimming franti-
cally in an endeavor to escape being overwhelmed by
the quantity of floating things which threatened to
submerge him. Finally the swimmers got clear of
the jackets, and reached the Kirrule, where the
rescued person angrily demanded the names and
addresses of the people who had pelted him with life
obstacles. Next day irascible mariners went poking
round Port Jackson looking for their missing
jackets, most of which had dodged past Bradley’s
towards the open sea.
Richard Butler, S. Aus. Minister for
Works, after his run round the water-ways
of the Eastern States :
The control of the Melbourne and Sydney Harbor
Boards is confined to those two harbors respectively,
the trade being largely centralised in those two
capitals. In South Aus. the Government believes
strongly in decentralisation, trade wherever possible
being encouraged to flow to its natural outlet, and
the control of our Board’ shortly to be appointed
will extend from the west coast and Port Augusta
to Port Mac Donnell on the sount coast.
Was there ever a Government that wasn't
in favor of decentralisation? The only real
difference between S. Aus. and most other
States is that the Broken Hill mines, not
being interested in boosting Adelaide,
poured their traffic into Port Pirie, and gave
it a sizeable trade; while the Wallaroo and
Moonta mines, being right on the coast of
Spencer’s Gulf, necessarily created another
seaport there. The oversea trade of those
two ports and of Adelaide represented
£15,100,000 of the State’s total of
£16,600,000 for 1912, giving a poor little
£1,500,000 for all the others. The richest
tract of country in the whole State is in
the south-east; but so persistently has traffic
been dragged from there to Adelaide that
there isn’t a liarbqr thereabouts that would
keep one man and a hand-truck employed.

There is a point of humorous interest in
the story recently told to the Inter-State
Commission in Melbourne anent the indigna-
tion of a lady when she discovered that her
favorite brand of “imported” footwear was
really the work of Australian hands. The
lady it appears is one of the big personages
among our Idle Classes, and what seasons
the joke for low plebeian consumption is the
fact that her husband is a very high fune-
tionarv who, after the fowl has been dis-
membered and the champagne laid to rest,
often preaches the great gospel of support
to Australian industries.
Two witnesses of the execution of Ned
Kelly passed out last week. Jim Middleton,
late of Melbourne Herald, was the Age
representative at the hanging of Ned in
1880. Ex-sergeant Arthur Steele, who died
at Wangaratta (Vic.), was the actual cap-
turer of the bushranger aforesaid. He
came of fighting stock, for his father was a
captain in the Ist Inniskilling Dragoons,
and five of his brothers died on battlefields.
Middleton came of writing stock, for his
father was an Age man before him. Although
the pen is mightier than the sword. Middle-
ton was eight years younger than the old
policeman when they both went the way of
the most notorious person they ever met.
If they haven’t already found him, they are
probably singing, “Has anybody here seen
Kelly?”

An obelisk, carrying on its four faces
matter relative to the discovery and settle-
ment of Portland (Vic.) in the year 1834,
■is presently to be erected on the northern
foreshore of Portland Bay, and amidst much
cackle a “foundation stone” will be laid on
April 18. On the same occasion there is
to be the cracking of a bottle or two to sig-
nify the joy of the inhabitants over the
recent discovery of their anchorage by the
State OoA r ernment. Harbor improvements
have at length been arranged for, with an
inward reservation that, in order to pre-
serve the Melbourne monopoly, the differ-
ential railway rates and other'swindles will
kill them dead. The fathers of the
hamlet hope to borrow a warboat for the
festivity, and. already the school-children of
the district are rehearsing a variety of patri-
otic warbles. But a straight line of rail-
way to. connect Portland with the country
for which it is the natural outlet, and an
honest attempt to give the great harbor
a show, would be better than all the warbles
and obelisks between Marathon and Water-
loo.
The poor old Australian language had
another shock last week when letters began
to appear in the Sydney papers about “the
Hospitalisation of Infants”’
With due decorum the Melbourne
Athenaeum (the library, not the club) this
month celebrates its 75th birthday. The
place was started as the Melbourne
Mechanics’ Institute in 1839, and Captain
Lonsdale, Superintendent for Victoria
(then part of the Ma State), was its first
president. The institute, an old brick
building, was described in the defunct Daily
Telegraph as “the noblest edifice in the
province”; but its nobility was sacrificed
in 1872 and the present hall (which is not
exactly palatial) was put up. At the same
time the name was changed to the Mel-
bourne Athenaeum. The idea of the library
was Redmond Barry’s; he started it by
allowing members the use of his collection
of books. Several valuable historical works
are included in the present collection. Gar-
net Welch was secretary of the Athenaeum,
1872-9, and Marcus Clarke also held the job
for a brief period ; while the present sec. is

columns of the Argus. The Athenaeum is a
refuge for parsons and retired oldsters, who
find the soporific atmosphere of the reading-
room much to their liking. The place has
always been so dreadfully respectable that
there was almost a riot among the most
ancient members when the committee lately
so far forgot itself as to build a smoking-
room; and there is a feeling in some quar-
ters that the management has fallen into
the hands of revolutionaries or pro-Boers.
A gallery for art exhibitions was added to
the building in 1911, and is still the best
room of its kind in Melbourne.

The remarkably ignorant Sydney Tele-
graph, which persists in describing James
Cook as the discoverer of Australia and ar-
guing that because Smith isn’t so helplessly
in debt as Brown he is perfectly solvent,
couldn’t be expected to do anything but fall
over a statistical obstacle no matter how
absurd it appeared. Thus, when a cable-
gram reached it from the medical congress
at Auckland (M.L.) last week that an
authority had declared .4 per cent, of Aus-
tralian children to be feeble-minded and 1.2
so mentally dull as to require special train-
ing, it burst upon a staggered community
with the figures minus the decimal points.
Probably the cabled message did not mention
decimals, the despatcher reckoning that even
the Telegraph would know that four per
cent, and 12 per cent, respectively were
first cousins to a lunatic asylum. But the
dull old lady just ran it in that way and
when Minister for Education Carmichael
arose and scoffed at the figures she shook
her gamp at him and told him that “no good
purpose was to be served by extravagant
denunciations... .For Mr. Carmichael to in-
troduce so much vehemence shows that he
has got the subject altogether out of per-
spective.” There’s superiority for you!
A complaint was raised last week that the
onetime Henry Parkes of N.S.W. isn’t suffi-
ciently remembered, and that his grave isn’t
kept green. “Is Henry Parkes forgotten?”
shouted a strong daily paper correspondent
in his agony. Well, to tell the solemn truth,
even though it may be dragged from the com-
munity with difficulty, the ancient poser and
opportunist is just about forgotten. So are
his deeds of statesmanship, for when he left
the stage, people who had been hypnotised
by his chest and shoulders and his thunder-
ous upheaval of hair realised that, after all,
he did very little, though he said very much.
liis Kiama ghost is forgotten. His remark-
able land Speculations are forgotten. His
poems are forgotten, even the one about
how “On the Rocky Mountains’ height,
10,000 feet above the sea, love, my Stella
kissed me in the night, and none were there
but you and me, love” ; and the other which
declared, “I would not give my Ragged Jane
for all the peacock ladies going; she’s the one
to soothe your pain ; what she don’t know is
not. worth knowing.” They are almost as
perished as that ode of his political successor
which declared :
The advantages of co-operation were fully understood
By that best of all princes, Albert the Good.
And Parkes’s “Fifty Tears in the Making of
Australian History” had hardly been on the
market three months before it had slid down
into the cheap remnant basket in the second-
hand emporiums. This world may owe every
man board and lodging while he is alive, but
it doesn’t necessarily owe him a memory and
tribute and garland when he is defunct. In
the grave there is free competition, and the
fittest ghost survives, and the law of de-
mand and supply runs the show. Of course
the fittest ghost that survives is sometimes
the best advertised ghost—not the most de-
serving one. But if a ghost which shouted
on the top rung of the ladder of advertisement
during a whole generation drops promptly
out of sight in the tomb the inference is
that he was not great, but only resembled
greatness.

Agar Wynne’s stepson, Charles Dudgeon,
has no luck with step-pa’s motor-car. Some
time ago, during repairs to the bridge which
carries Chapel-street over Melbourne’s larg-
est drain, Dudgeon and the car somehow
got through the contractor’s guard-rail, and
landed on the bottom, with all parties some-
what broken up, including the motor-car.
Now Agar Wynne’s vehicle has hurled the
young man and itself into an electric tram-
car, smashing the conductor’s right leg. If
Dudgeon is ever again permitted to sit in a
motor-car in Melbourne, it will be more
than his luck with such vehicles appears to
warrant.
LOVE BELOW GROUND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
St. Hilda Council, having lit up all the upper
beach, and allowed the building of a score of roaring
shows that throw a fierce, white light over two-thirds
of the foreshore, has now decided to effectively light
the last remaining few acres of sands within its
jurisdiction. The Aon advises other seaside munici-
palities to carry* on the good work.
We picture Cupid with a torch,
Which to the poet’s soul conveys,
Not that sweet Love is meant to scorch,
But that the tender, rosy rays
That from his tiny band proceed
Give all the light that lovers need.
But councillors are dull old scamps,
And they no longer understand.
They turn their incandescent lamps
To light the long, soft, kindly sand ;
And cursing on the paths above,
The lovers find no place for Love.
Grim Science, cold and heartless, too,
Will light the whole world’s surface soon,
And night, so long to lovers true,
Will glare in angry glow of noon.
Then burrowing, to pay its toll,
Poor Love must emulate the mole.

Once again the law (by the mouth of
Judge Wasley, in the Vic. County Court)
has put in a word for the missus, and maybe
the kids. Percy Mitchell’s creditors had
seized the family furniture. Thereupon
Mary Ellen, wife unto Percy, claimed that
she had bought the furniture with savings
screwed out of the housekeeping money, and
therefore it was hers. Judge Wasley slapped
her kindly on the back and told her to keep
the furniture. After reading this case the
average citizen would hand over all his
screw to his wife, if it weren’t so d—d hard
to borrow back a couple of shillings when
wanted. Some wives are flintier than judg-
ment creditors.
‘Cook intervenes,” shouted one Sydney
morning paper after the harassed little man
had come back from more or less settling
the strike for reasonably pure water at the
attempted Federal Capital of Canbilly. “In-
tervenes,” one of the most dignified words
in the language, suggests some overpowering
personality coming between two smaller
combatants, who are ready to fling them-
selves at each other’s throats over some
question involving the national honor. And
this was merely a small, worried, bald,
spectacled politician with a precarious hold
on his job persuading a few thirsty and re-
bellious workers not to mind the taste of
dead rabbit in the water. That isn’t inter-
vening ; or, if it is, a suit of old clo’ is a
cathedral.

Said that Munro-Ferguson, successor of G.-
G. Denman, is being shunted to Australia
by the Asquith Government because he is an
obstinate creature who might make trouble
over Lloyd-George’s new land legislation.
Well, if the figurehead for the time being is
chosen on this simple, shabby plan, White
Australia must he regarded in England as a
sane, easily-run place where Capital is still
pretty safe and a little, inexperienced man
can’t go very far wrong. Glance down the

ener) ; Canada (Duke of Connaught) ;

Each Victorian municipality has its
officer of health —several of him in some
cases, where the territory is big. The anti-
quated Health Act requires him to furnish
the Board of Health, through the council,
with an annual report. Usually it is a very
mechanical and insipid article (the better
he knows his business the more insipid), and
mostly is a dull and dreary repetition of it-
self. Should he have a keen scent and a
fluent pen, he will most assuredly reap his
reward; for. his immediate boss is the coun-
cil, and although it is a one-mouse concern
in other respects it has the power of remov-
ing him, and promptly uses it if he
makes himself obnoxious. But he’s
generally a canny medico, who rea-
lises how a fool and his perfunctorily-
earned guinea are soon parted, so he
just pursues the line of least resistance,
lets things slide, and hangs on to the nice
little sinecure, with its allied benefits, till re-
moved by natural causes. Dr. Ley, however,
recently threw discretion to the polluted
winds of Rodney, where the irrigation scan-
dals came from, and gave the local council a
candid account of his stewardship. For
example:—
Some time ago he was asked to report on slaughter-
yards, in conjunction with the inspector of nuisances.
They did so, and condemned one of the yards as a
disgrace to the town. He did not condemn the other
one, which was almost equally bad. The council was
not honest with him. He found the council only
made a tool of him to get the yard he condemned
shifted “so that one of their number could build his
house close to the site and inhale the sweet breezes
that blow over the lake that has been purified by
some 30 years’ collection of pig manure.” They
shifted the slaughter-yard in question to where
“three-fourths of all the breezes that blow take the
smell almost, into the' very heart of the place.”
As the Board of Health remarked, the re-
port showed a “great want of tact”; and
“tact” being ever so much more important
than truth, it was decided that the report be
not received, and that the services of the
“tactless” doctor be dispensed with.
The latest “permanent and repro-
ductive” work to mop up the loan
money of Uncle Abrahambenjamin-
moses in Maoriland is a new track to
Milford Sound. The present path, 31
miles long, which is alleged to be the
finest walk in the world, runs from
Lake Te Anau, up the Clinton Valley,
over the McKinnon Pass, and along-
side the Sutherland Falls to the Sound.
Tlje new track, about 45 miles long,
over the lately discovered Grave Pass,
will run from Lake Wakatipu, through
magnificent alpine and
lake scenery to the
Sound. It will be
called the Grave and
Talbot track, after the
Government guides
who blazed it. The
chief advantage of the
new route,is that it
provides a round trip
to Maoriland’s famous
Sound; so in future
the haughty tourist
won’t be able to curse
about having to retrace
his steps. The trouble
with “the finest walk
in the world” is that
the energetic tourist
has to come back the
way he went; though
that isn’t so very much of a griev-
ance, If you go early in the
tourist season, when the avalanche
is just waking up and the land-
slide is just settling down, you may
find 24 waterfalls on the way
home which weren’t there on the
way out. Also you may find quite
a different mass of ice on the track,
and six new creeks broken loose,
and a heap of other changes. A
Bulletin man made the mistake
once of being the first tourist over the
road when the season opened. He did it
through ignorance—not heroism; the fact
was that he didn’t know there was any
special season. On the way to the Sound
his hair turned grey, but on the way back
the aspect of affairs was so much changed
that it resumed its natural color. Then he
went to look at Mount Cook and became
bald. He has remained that way ever since.
“Triple Rail” pens a guffaw:—
Evidently passengers on Victoria’s railways exist
for the convenience of the Department, which regards
them solely as sources of revenue, and will stand no
nonsense. Back in last November, as a Melbourne-to-
Ballarat excursion train was passing through North
Melbourne, some lunatic tossed a bottle into a
carriage, breaking the window and cutting a passen-
ger’s arm badly. Naturally he desired to get out
and have it attended to. but there was no com-

Talking of domestic servants a sympathiser asked,
“What time has she to secure an eligible husband,
and compete with girls in shops, or a girl in her own
home?’’ One lady replied: “Oh, I don’t see why
the girls should go hunting around to secure hus-
bands. I have several very nice tradesmen calling
here.” —Daily paper.

munication cord, so his brother stepped out on the
footboard and endeavored to attract attention as
they passed through the stations. They had got as
far as Sunshine, of disastrous memory, when it
dawned on an official that something was amiss, and
the outfit was pulled up and the case investigated.
They managed to save the victim from bleeding to
death, but his brother had wilfully and defiantly
broken regulation Q 497, which prohibits passengers
from entering or leaving a carriage in motion —even
though a collision is imminent; so, after long con-
sideration, the Department haled the youth before the
beaks and desired to have him punished. Fortu-
nately the beaks happened to be in a sane humor,
and told the Department to go and see if the signals
were safe and quit acting the foal or the calf or
whatever animal it might be.
The grief of the Oldest Inhabitant: —
The license of the Royal Hotel, George-street, Syd-
ney, has been cancelled because of the old pub’s
persistent disrepair. It is one of the most ancient
hotels standing in the city, having been built in
1840 on the site of another Royal, which was burned
down, with the Theatre Royal, on St. Patrick’s night
in the same year. The original house was built about
1830, and had a mill on the roof. As the sails used
to frighten horses, Governor Bourke ordered their
removal. The hotel’s “long room” was first used
as a theatre, but subsequently the home of drama
became independent of the hotel, and was known as
the Theatre Royal. In those days Barnet Levy was
owner of both hotel and theatre. The Victoria,
opened in 1838, smashed the Royal. Levy was dead
by that time, and the widow tried to carry on, and
failed. The fire, which took rise in a stable on an
adjoining property, extended to the hotel, and thus
the end came. Joe Wyatt, who built the Victoria
Theatre (1838) and the Prince of Wales Opera
House (1855), was owner at the time of the Are, the
lessee being John Sparke, who had kept the Aus-
tralian Inn—originally the home of Isaac Nichols
and the first post office —in Lower George-street. He
was father of the late W. E. Sparke, who left half a
million to relatives a few years ago. John Terry
Hughes got possession of the site, and built the
house just delicensed. Apparently he was his own
architect. John Sparke again became the tenant, and
died there in 1851. Amongst notable later landlords
was one of the Wiltshire family, and O. C. Skarratt,
a blue-blood amongst hotelkeepers. Years later he
matle a pile in Mount Morgans. Now, after a life
of threequarters of a century, the old place is doomed
—as it might have been years ago, but for the fact
that staunch buildings on either side held it up.
“0.C.C.”: Despite the tacit conspiracy of
the Sydney dailies not to mention the un-
pleasing fact, there is little doubt that at time
of writing something of a drought exists in
parts of the Ma State. When you find
places as diverse and as far apart as Single-
ton, Dubbo, Dapto and Mullumbimby sending
along wires to the
effect that there lias
been no rain of any
“beneficial” character
since September, 1913,
and that “the tanks
have given out weeks
ago” ; also that even
the oldest romancers
in the district disre-
member anything so
dry, while the springs
where grandpa used
to wash his sore toe
when a lad are “dry-
ing up”—well, there
is only one conclusion
to he drawn. At
Kiama. (the place
where ' old Parkes
used to keep his
■'“ghosts,V and where
ex-Treasprer Ca n n
keeps his quarries)
the dreary old farce
of “prayers for rain”
has been revived. In
addition, when the
Telegraph, which
last Christmas swelled
out its chest and
proudly announced
that the “estimate”
of the “department”
was for a “record
wheat yield esti-
mated at something
like 43,000,000 bush-
els” —when you find
that inaccurate and

That grand American business motto,
“Rob Him Now!” has evidently been taken
to heart by at least one Sydney person. The
other evening a ferryboat ran down an un-
lighted launch, and while the shrieks were
at their loudest and the confusion at its
maddest, some Samaritan threw off some of
his clothes preparatory to diving in to the
rescue of any splashing shadow he might
catch sight of. later on, he turned
to resume his garments, he found that his
watch had been taken. ■ This incident gives
Sydney a new Mean Champion. The former
holder won the dishonor by stealing the rug
off a sick horse.
If the Christian Church neglects her responsibilities
there may be a gigantic upheaval, and Christian
races may be completely smothered. —Bishop Druitt.

SNAPDRAGONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They are women with a secret, these snapdragons,
That is why they shut their mouths so tight
That every man may know
By the haughty way they go
They have something worth the telling to a wight!
Tenderly I prise them open —find the tongue is all of
gold,
Surely, ’tis the tongue of poets, mellow in a story
old,
Some fair runs of morning meadows, lit with many
golden flowers
That the wizard sun has made us from the silver of
the showers! • .
See them in their velvet bonnets, very modest and
demure,
But I hold their shy demeanor just a cunning form
of lure—
\ onder bloom is striped and fluffy as the skirts of a
Pierette
Lifted on a curve of beauty sly Pierrot will not
forget!
Here is one all soft and creamy as a bride in lan-
gorous hours—
They are women... .they are poets.... and they, best
of all, are flowers!

The last full-blooded Tasmanian black
died years ago, and it is alleged now, on
what looks like good authority, that only
one half-caste is left. Till a month ago
there was another, Harry Beaton; but he
died at the age of about 75 on Cape Barren
Island, Bass Straits. His father was an
educated Englishman, who dropped his old
name when he took Mrs. Binghi to be his
blushing bride.
“Martin”: Various scribes have heaved the brick
of scorn at Randolph Bedford’s eulogy of James
Tyson, but the old chap possessed horse-sense all
right. He was watching a farmer struggling with a
bag of chaff near Warwick Downs (Queensland) one
day. The. farmer had nearly filled the bag, and was
ramming in enough to complete the parcel, when it
tore with a loud rip. “You chaps will never save
money by buying inferior bags,” he said. “You lose
time and money by so doing.” There are “Sack
Snecialists” in Sydney, namely, T. SMITH’S, LTD.
Get into touch with them, and save time, temper and
cash.*
In case the recent presentation of the
Koyal Shipwreck Relief Society’s gold medal
to George Reid, per Mrs. Reid, should be
misunderstood, The Bulletin hastens to add
that the High Conditioner has not been
throwing himself into the sea or dragging
anyone out of it. The hero’s reward was
apparently conferred on George because he
had eaten for the Society, and the gold medal
was the only thing the grateful Society had
about it. So George arrives gloriously
amongst the astonished marine heroes with
the usual napkin tucked under his chin, and
his knife and fork firmly grasped in either
hand.
Quinton McKinnon, the Maoriland ex-
plorer who in 1888 discovered the famous
McKinnon Pass that makes possible the over-
land trip to Milford Sound, is to get a brick
put up to his memory. The Gaelic Society
an( l iA e Rugby Union, assisted by
the M.L. Government, are arranging to
place on the summit of McKinnon Pass a
memorial cairn built of rough-hewn stone,
topped by a cross and fronted at the base
by a memorial slab of granite. McKinnon,
who was a lone-hand explorer, was drowned
in Lake Te Anau through his boat capsizing
in 1892 —four years after he blazed the
famous track. He did it all for sheer love
of the game.
AMERICA AND JAPAN.
With the constantly improving means of communi-
cation between Eastern Asia and the Pacific Coast,
the Yellow Peril comes closer and closer every day,
and within a few years the Asiatic problem in the
West might become even more serious than the
negro problem in the South.— Sydney Telegraph.
The Intruder : “ And you, too Mrs. Tele-
graph ! ”
C. A. Schultz, dead in Adelaide at 52, had
been all the working years of his life in the
A.M.P. Society.. He started as a small boy
in Sydney, was in the Melbourne office, then
accountant in Wellington (M.L.), and for
nearly 10 years had been manager in Ade-
laide. The end came with apoplexy, paraly-
sis and a general break-up—mercifully
pretty speedy.
By the Religious Editor: —
The Sydney police ran the spectacled Chidley to
earth again last week, and overpowered him with
blither. Then they haled the desperately mild old
gentleman to court on a charge that would fix any
possessor of a brightly improper picture postcard, and
got him sentenced to two months’ gaol, sentence to
be suspended on Chidley entering into a bond of £2O
to be of good behavior for 12 months. And this is
all so useful and so necessary, because, as everybody
but the unpolished copper knows, Chidley is one of
the best behaved men in Sydney—in fact, he is a
lot better behaved than most policemen. But it was
a great capture. It is useless for Chidley to disguise
himself in a classic hygienic costume unlike anything
else in town, and to try and avert suspicion by walk-
ing about in company with a brown bag. The Law
is dead-sure that he is a dangerous man, because his
clothes can be washed, and it has slowly and pain-
fully learnt those clothes, so that, as long as Chidley
remains in them, the Law will know him at once.
Finally—and this is most important—every Hop in
town has mastered the spelling of his simple name.
So Chidley can rely on being captured and summoned
quite frequently. But, anyhow, why shouldn’t he be
captured and summoned ? A man with so much hair
on his legs arouses suspicion.
Alban Gee, of the Sydney Meat Preserving
Works, is now the only one left of the trin-
ity that started the business of meat-packing
in Australia. The originator of the idea
was C. G. Tindal, who died in England only
a few weeks ago. He was squatting at
Ramornie, on the N.S.W. North Coast, and,
like many other stockowners., had been boil-
ing down beasts for the tallow. The shock-
ing waste of good meat worried Tindal, who
whipped up his influential friends in London
(his father was a governor of the Bank of
England), and raised capital for preserving
works. Thomas Cordingley came out as
chemist; Alban Gee as packer. Things,
however, didn’t go too well, and both were
soon out of a job. Gee struck a clever idea
and established the Sydney Meat Preserving
Co.; kindly and courteous Tom Cordingley,
who died four or five years ago, moved pre-
sently up to Townsville, and there set up
meat works, which the Trust lately took
over. Tindal stuck to Ramornie, and even-
tually the whole thing fell into his hands. It
is much the oldest beefery in Australia, and
of late years has specialised in beef extract,
hundreds of gallons of which are understood
to go into the innards of the French army.
Apparently the newly-appointed superfluity
has to open his head and say something when
greatness is shoved upon him. Munro-Fergu-
son. the new foreign G.-G. of Australia,
speaking grandiloquently to some of his con-
stituents at Leith (they must have been
deeply uninterested) declared that “Australia
was more British than Canada and that it”
(that is to say, Australia) “was the brightest
of all the Dominions.” What does Munro-
Ferguson know of Australia, and how is it
“the brightest of all the Dominions”? Does
he mean that it is the brightest borrower?
“X.P.D.” adds a few remarks:—
Ex-Governor Fuller’s kinsman, the Rev. Wyndham
S. Heathcote, who has got the billet of chief priest
to the Melbourne Unitarians, is likely to raise fury
among’ the belltoppers of Victoria. His fatal gift of
wit brought him big congregations in Bundaberg
(Q.) when he was rector of the Anglican Church
there. The wind of his eloquence was not tempered
to the front pews, and a certain rich man was so
wild that he left the church loudly and presented
it 100 to the local R.C. priest. Heathcote’s sins
against the Right Thinking section of Bundaberg
were many, and included a lecture on Socialism,
delivered in a theatre; remarks to the effect that
the Sermon on the Mount didn’t mean something
quite different; and remarks made in a public place
(to wit, “that man Fisher’s’’ meeting) about the Bib-
lical assertion that “The evil thing shall be no more
called Liberal.’’ Heathcote will have big congrega-
tions. Some will come to learn, some to laugh with
him, some to get mad, some to feed on intellect and
oratory. But they’ll come.
From an old gallery hand :
The atrabilious Wm. Forster, for a time Jack
Robertson’s Treasurer, had a bitter hatred of Parkes
and his proteges. For this reason Dan O’Connor
used to be often severely tongue-lashed. One night
when Forster was speaking, Dan made a personal
interjection, and Forster, in a tone which was as
caustic as the words, said: “Mr. Speaker, I would
not presume to ape the hon. member. For me to try
to assume the Chesterfieldian airs of politeness and
the Addisonian elegance of diction which are so
characteristic of the hon. member would be to
attempt the impossible. It has been my misfortune
not to have had opportunity to acquire those more
than gentlemanly and cultured instincts which are
associated with the noble profession of pig-sticking.”
Dan had been fined for slaughtering a lamb in a
back room of his home on a Sunday morning. The
charge was denied, Dan asserting that at the time
of the alleged offence he was at Mass. No one
doubted that he had been to Mass, but the magistrate
believed that he had killed the lamb before he went.
The incident gave the irascible Forster his chance,
and he said: “The hon. member presents the truly
edifying, Christian-like _ spectacle of sanctifying
God’s holy day by shedding the blood of an innocent
lamb, and then with the blood on his hands and the
reek of it in his beard, going to God’s holy edifice,
and there, with devout genuflections, humbling him-
self before the Image of the Lord.”
Amongst the guests at the League of
Ancient Mariners’ outing in Sydney on
Saturday was Mr. Johnston, the sole sur-
vivor of the wreck of the Dunbar at the Gap,
just outside the entrance to Port Jackson,
56 years ago-
FULL AND PLENTY.
The Suffragists characterise the Bishop of London’s
statement as a “whitewashing report,” and invite
him to show practically the faith that is in him
by undergoing forcible feeding in public. —News item.
HIS BISH.: “ Now, my good soul, don’t be—
ahem!—pardon me — ridiculous. Do I look
as though I require forcible feeding?”
Ex-hotelkeeper “Geebung” Kelly’s death
in Sydney recalls one of Henry* Parkos’s
early jobs in Australia. When Kelly landed
in 1839 he found work in P. N. Russell's
foundry, then in what is now Dalley-street;
and Parkes was one of his early shop-mates.
Elliot Smith, son of a N. S. Wales public
school teacher, has been selected vice-presi-
dent of the Royal Society of Great Britain.
He graduated at Sydney in 1893 after a
brilliant course, and was marked as a special-
ist in the structure of the brain. Journey-
ing to England, he climbed one rung after
another until he reached Cairo as
professor of anatomy. To-day he is recog-
nised as the authority on the comparative
anatomy of the brain, and is also boss ex-
pert on the bones and intelligence of the
ancient Egyptian mummy. A highly-cultured
Australian can always depend upon honor-
able attention in a foreign country.
Paul Foelsche, Inspector of Police in the
Northern Territory from the end of 1869 to
the end of 1903, was so content with the
local climate and his hobbies of Freemasonrv,
dentistry, rifle-making and photography that
he took only two regular holidays in his long
official career, which lasted till he was 73
years old.
SENATOR RUSSELL (Vic.).
A page of Kelly Gang history:—
Passed out at Wangaratta, on February 9, aged
75, ex-Sergeant Arthur Loftus Maule Steele, who
brought down Ned Kelly with a charge of buckshot
in the legs, on June 28, 1880. After shooting ■ the
informer, Aaron Sherritt, in the hills near Beech-
worth, the four members of the gang took charge of
the Glenrowan Hotel, and packed all the residents
therein. The prisoners included the local constable.
They made the railway ganger tear up the line on a
steep embankment on the Beechworth side of Glen-
rowan, and returned to the pub to await develop-
ments. A special train loaded with police was
despatched to Beechworth as soon as the news reached
Melbourne of the murder of Sherritt, and the lot
would have come to grief at the embankment but for
the act of schoolmaster Gurnow (still at Ballarat),
who, on the plea of visiting his sick child, persuaded
Ned to allow him to leave the hotel late at night.
Gurnow ran down the line in the darkness and
stopped the train. The police then surrounded the
hotel and commenced pouring lead into its thin
walls, where men, women and children were huddled,
with the result that at least two innocent people
were killed. Some of the residents of Glenrowan are
still drawing - pensions from the Government for
bullets which they are carrying in their bodies.
Steele was patrolling near Wangaratta when one of
his men heard the firing at Glenrowan. The patrol
hurried to the scene. “Just at the break of day,”
Steele told a Bulletin man, “we were lying in the
timber at the rear of the hotel when behind us in
the fog came a solitary figure enveloped in what
appeared to be a long cloak. I thought for the
moment it was a local black with a blanket wrapped
round him; we had not the faintest idea that any
of the gang had escaped from the house. Suddenly
the figure raised its arm and fired several revolver
shots. Ned’s bad shooting can only be accounted
for by the weight of his armor and the difficulty he
had in the bad light of seeing through the slit in
the helmet. We returned the fire and saw him
stagger as our bullets struck his body, but he still
came on. I could hear the bullets hit him with a
ring, and grasping the fact that he was armored,
discarding my revolver, grabbed my gun, fired at his
legs with a charge of buckshot, and brought him
down. I rushed at him as he struggled to his feet
to take aim, and grabbed his revolver arm. He was
all out and gave no more trouble.” Steele has been
living in retirement for many years at Wangaratta
with his wife and his grown-up family and his
roses. The aged mother of the Keilys is, by the way,
still living—a hospitable old lady whose face is full
of sorrow.
“Red Tape”: James Killian, who waited
on successive N. S. Wales Lands Ministers
for quarter of a century has, after death,
panned out at £9913, a sum more than equal
to the estates of half a dozen Ministers who
can easily be remembered. Killian was
head messenger in the Department, and his
financial stability was an envious word
among the clerical staff. He came down
real handsome for his mother church, and
thereby leaves an inspiring example to an
age that more and more inclines to blew its
substance on frail vanities and unsubstan-
tial froth.
THE VICE-REGAL SUPERMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The coining of two Governors has imposed an ex-
hausting task upon Melbourne dailies. They have
been put to the necessity of representing two dis-
tinct individuals as special creations, each the best
possible. After a sunburst of laudation extending
over two weeks, we are left with the impression that
the two new figureheads are not only superior to all
other men in virtue and attainments, but each is
superior to both of them.
Behold, how glorious they grow !
How wise and worshipful they are!
What wondrous loads of things they know !
Each intellect is like a star
That, through the darkness and the mire,
Fills this mean world with heavenly fire—-
Both are a beacon and a goal
'To him who hath a hopeful soul.
As poor Australians born, we know
We may not scale the dizzy I'rf~hts
Where pure Imperial Governors glow ;
But still our weak, aspiring flights
Unto that sweet perfection lift
Us from the dregs above the drift.
And that is all the Gover -nor
By Heaven is created for.
From out the wastes of nothingness
He’s wrested like a splendid pearl ,
Snatched from the depths. Then journals stress
His gifts, his hair’s entrancing curl,
The perfect turn of calf and lip,
His glorious works of statesmanship ;
With what hard days and sleepless nights
He’s saved his country at sham fights.
Her Ladyship—consider her !
Her splendid style, her winning grace,
The tact that’s never known to err,
The subtle glory of her face.
The fit and lovely mate is she
For that most perfect Excellency,
Reviewing which we hardly can
Believe there’s been a fall of man.
VICTORIA.

Thus in any four months since 1910 the profits
have exceeded the total amount of capital
put into the undertaking! Had the State built the
line, and required (say) 6 p.c. on the capital to
provide interest and sinking fund, Private Enterprise,
in the shape of the Broken Hill cos. and the
townspeople, would have saved something like
£400,000 during the past three years. State Social-
ism may be a tiger; but, when it gets a chance,
Private Enterprise knows far better how to rend the
lamb and suck its blood.
Of course, officially, the business isn’t put in the
foregoing manner. The management (in its way a
very good management indeed) says the capital is
£250,000, and the dividends for the year conse-
quently a paltry 50 p.c. The discrepancy is explained
this way:—
1886. —Co. registered; paid capital £46,800, plus
£16,000 in promoters’ shares.
1888. —First stock watering: £41,860 capitalised
(two shares for every three).
1889. —Second stock watering; £17,433 (one in six);
Third stock watering, £15,273 (one in
eight).
1890. —Fourth stock watering, £27,473 (one in five).
1891. —Fifth stock watering, £32,967 (one in five).
1910.—Sixth stock watering, £52,194 (one in four).
So you get this: —
Capital actually subscribed .. .. £46,800
Promoters’ little lot . . . . . . 16,000
Profits capitalised . . . . . . 187,200
Total alleged capital . . . . £250,000
The promoters’ little lot would now represent about
£64,000 of capital, carrying a div. for last year of
£32,000. Probably nobody knows now what became
of that £16,000 in shares. The late W. P. McGre-
gor, who went into the N.S.W. Parliament to put
the Bill through, and retired as soon as he had done
the job, is dead ; and most of the secret went with
him. Certainly he did say that he could have got a
concession to build a railway to the moon if he could
offer enough “inducement.” Those were the good
days when payment of members was unknown, and
the House consisted of patriots who were above
sordid considerations.
Get rid of it ? It is quite easy. The Act, passed
is aforesaid, provides a way. All the State has to
:lo is to pay the co. 21 times the average annual
orofit for the preceding seven years. So the State
-an have this scrap of cheap line, running through
30 miles of saltbush plain, for a mere £2,525,000
ar so. And how much better off would either the
State or Broken Hill be then? If it bought the line
and got a return of 6 p.c. to pay interest and sink-
ing fund, the State would itself have to collect an
average of over £150,000 in excess of working exes.
That is to say, instead of reducing fares and freights
it would have to increase them. And perhaps even
6 p.c. wouldn’t allow for a sufficient sinking fund,
because the line will be of no value when Broken
Hill is worked out; and vast as the Broken Hill ore
body is, there is an end to it somewhere. As far as
one can see, it won’t come to an end with a sudden
jerk; but it will tail off to nothing. The chances
are that these are the years of its heaviest tonnages ;
not because at least three mines, and probably five,
won’t go on producing as much ore for the next
dozen years as they are producing now. but because
the present production is largely inflated by the
using-up of tailings dumps which went on growing
for 15 years until the zinc-flotation process was
developed. There will be very little of those dumns
left in five years from now, given reasonable markets
for zinc and lead during that period. One way and
another, about one-third of the co.’s freight is due
to the treatment of these stored products. A further
possibility is the construction of a Government line
from Condobelin or elsewhere to Broken Hill, and
thence on to the S. Aus. border. The Condobolin-
Broken Hill work has been passed by Parliament;
all it awaits now is the loosening of Cohen’s purse.
But, unless the line connects with the S. Aus. svs-
tem at Cockburn, it won’t cut very deeplv into this
co.’s traffic. The bulk of the stuff will still go on to
Port Pirie, where a port can be reached in little less
than half the distance.
The co.’s capital (as watered) is in 250,000 shares.
Fixed assets, including rolling stock ( £71,864),
amount to £215,009 ; and there was on December
31 approximately £233,000 of other assets net, nearly
all public securities and cash.

Hooray! That is better almost than The Bulletin
expected. Twelve months ago, in noting that the
directors proposed to transfer £150,000 to capital,
making the £lO shares paid to £3 instead of £2,
this paper hoped that the Board wouldn’t depart
from its old policy of strengthening the reserves to
keep pace with the growing business. In other
words, that it wouldn’t jujmp up the dividend to
£67,500 (=l5 p.c. on the increased capital).. As
will be seen by the table, the directors actually don’t
pay any more, in the aggregate, than they did the
previous year. The result is a magnificent addition
of £70,097 to reserves, after handing £5OOO over to
the Officers’ Provident Fund and writing £2773 off
investments. The interest earnings for the year were
£43,863, so that the whole of the underwriting
profit, less £1137, was available to strengthen the
co. and give greater security to the policyholders.
As a matter of fact, the progress of the co. is so
rapid—which is another way of saying that the
risks are increasing so fast —-that there are only two
things to be done; either the shareholders must put
more capital into the business or they must leave a
very large proportion of their profits untouched.
Consider the growth of the risks, as measured by pre-
miums, and compare them with the funds (capital
and reserves combined) :
Funds in
Proportion to
Premiums. Funds. Premiums.
1895 .. £267,917 £449,551 168 p.c. -
1900 .. 342,036 481,485 141 „
1905 . . 425,991 640,916 150 „

1912 . . 676,097 897,424 132 „
1913 .. 702,968 967,521 137 „
So it will be seen that, in spite of the fact that the
directors have hung on to so much of the profits,
the risks are not even now as well covered as they
used to be; in other words, the risks have increased
more rapidly than the funds. Moreover, though
there has been a steady improvement in the figures
since 1909, the funds in proportion to premiums are
even ifow only 137 p.c., which is less than the
British average and much less than the Australian.
As deposits grow and a bank takes the risk of work-
ing on them, that class of financial concern invariably
gets in more capital from its shareholders, and doesn’t
depend solely on the accumulation of reserved profits.
An insurance office might reasonably do the same
thing. This co. ought to have now another £150,000
at least of capital; and the directors ought to get it
in. Even then the co.’s capital and reserves would
amount to less than £l6O for every £lOO of pre-
miums, which would still be not quite as good as the
average of the 20 best British offices and considerably
below the Australian average. To quite deserve it's
brilliant. ac’'ievement in more than doubling the
premium income in 13 years the co. should increase
its capital to £600,000. If it won’t do that, the
directors should sit tight and not raise the dividend
a single point until capital and reserves combined
are brought up to where they can challenge com-
parison with the figures of other great offices.
Next as to losses and expenses;—

fSan Francisco disaster.
The expense rate is considerably below and The loss
rate a bit higher than the Australasian average, the
result, no doubt, of a big re-insurance and marine
business. The investments, like the risks, are almost
world-wide; but, though one might complain that
£332,849 is a great deal of money to fix in co.’s
offices and other properties, on the whole they seem a
satisfactory and profitable lot; though, seeing that
nearly half-a-million is in public securities, it is
very doubtful whether enough has been provided to
write these assets down to the low values at which
most of them now stand. So long as the co. doesn’t
have to realise on them it doesn’t matter much,
though, what the market quotation is, since that
doesn’t affect the interest return; wherefore the best
the. co. can hope for is that there won’t be another
Frisco disaster to call for a heap of money in a hurry
until, at any rate, public securities command a better
figure than they do to-day. Any ordinary trouble
can be met out of the till and from fixed deposits;
between branch balances and cash in other forms
there was a trifle of £190,000 to pay out with at
the end of November.

In 1904, a drought having hit the eastern part, of
Australia, the devil was sick and a saint would be.
This co. therefore decided to write down its capitai
by £73,384. At that time there were 183,460 issued
£1 shares paid to 18s. These were reduced to 12s.
shares paid to 10s., which meant that £73,384 dis-
appeared from the capital account. Things soon
improved—probably they never were as bad as they
looked —and a couple of years ago 6s. per share was
restored. Since then the shares have been nominally
18s., with 16s. paid. Now it has been decided to
restore the other 2s. ; they will thus for the future
be 205., paid to 18s. The div. at the old rate is
paid for the past half-year on the whole 18s. The
co.’s progress has justified the restoration of capital
supposedly lost. Look at this comparison:—

Liabilities .. 43,146 Z 6,194 22,503 25,495
Surplus ... £6,349 £79,007 £87,396 £93,578
Thus in 10 years the surplus of assets, exclusive of
freeholds, plant and fixed property, has grown by
£87,229. Part of this growth may have been due to
the sale of property and plant; but there is no trace
of anything of that sort in the accounts. On the
contrary, judging by the steady, movement, term after
term, the increase has been due simply to the accu-
mulation of profit in excess of the amount required to
pay the dividend and keep the plant in order. In
most cases the best a co. can do is to put the surplus
into the business. Here, £70,000 is in deposits or
public securities; and meantime, while this nice
little lot has been scraped together, the requirements
of the business haven’t been neglected, judging by
the growth of the profits. In fact, frequent refer-
ences have been made in the directors’ reports to
plant-additions. Just at present the largest refri-
gerating machine in the southern hemisphere is going
in ; and extensions of the cold storage accommodation
are 1 aing considered. No doubt, when these
improvements are made, the book value of the fixed
assets will jump; but, on past experience, it will
soon be reduced again by amounts written off profits
to cover depreciation. Altogether, then, it seems that
it can safely be assumed that more than enough has
been spent on plant out of profits to cover deprecia-
tion ; and if that is so, then the accumulation of liquid
assets, mentioned above, represents real profit in ex-
cess of the dividends. The 10 years’ record, in that
case, is very fine indeed. Certainly most things have
favored the co. The _ State hasn’t had a general
drought since 1904; in fact, seasons have mostly
been very good, and the demand for cold-storage, etc.,
exceptional. Also there have been conditions of in-
flated prosperity,Vlue to heavy State borrowing, from
which the co. has derived great benefit, first through
the cutting-out of competition in (say) the ice busi-
ness, there being enough boom trade to go
round, and then through unusual numbers of people
being able to afford to buy the co.’s cooked foods, or
being driven to do it because of the scarcity of Mary
Ann, Mary Ann’s father being so affluent that the
lady herself isn’t cooking or washing up for any
other party just at present. Conditions, in short,
have been abnormal, and this co. has been so placed
that it has derived an uncommon amount of benefit
from the abnormality.

If this co. had a motto, like some other trustee cos.
and Peter Doody, it would be “Least said, soonest
mended.’’ it is the most silent concern in the busi-
ness. It doesn’t even say the value of the estates in
hand, so one can’t trace its progress in that respect.
Just about all that one can do is to dig out the
figures given in the foregoing table, and add these:—
Dec., 1903. Dec., 1913.
Liquid assets .. .. £14,439 £36,878
Other assets . . .. 21,506 28,238
Liabilities . . .. 50 Nil
Liquid assets consist of Victorian Government stock
and Board of Works debentures; the other assets
include the co.’s Queen-street premises (£15,962)
and sundry debtors. In 10 years the co. has thus
added £22,439 to its liquid assets; and they are
hard stuff, whatever the unspecified other assets may
be. As it has done this on a paid capital of £25,000,
and after paying a dividend ranging from 8 p.c. to
30 p.c., the Equity wouldn’t be guilty of empty
boasting _ if it said that it was doing pretty well.
The co. is in 50,000 shares of £2 10s., each paid.to
10s., and the last time there was a sale of them, a
few days ago, the market said they were worth 30s.
Capital and reserves combined are worth! 255. (assum-
ing that book values of assets are real values), which
means that the market adds ss. for goodwill. Evi-
dently the market doesn’t reckon that there are going
to be any more 8 or 10 p.c. dividends. And it is
probably right, seeing that, . even if the business
didn’t earn more than its exes., 4 p.c. interest on the
co.’s funds would just about pay a 10 p.c. div. on
the capital.

Though there is nominally a good margin left over
after paying the 8 p.c. dividend, it is doubtful
whether the co. writes anything off for general wear
and tear. Hence the margin of true profits is pro-
bably very small. And when the building and recon-
struction boom eases down, the true profits will
almost certainly be affected. The shrinkage thusfar
in the visible profits is probably due to two causes:
(1) the keen competition of electric lifts; (2) the
increasing expense of maintenance. As to the former,
this table of gross revenue for the latter half of each
of the past eight years is significant:—
1906 .. £12,975 | 1910 .. £11,852
1907 . . 12,161 | 1911 . . 12,129
1908 . . 12,352 I 1912 . . 12,089
1909 . . 11,429 I 1913 . . 11,856
The amounts shown in the first table as written off
during the past two years are debited to Plant Re-
newal and Contingency Account; previous to that
all renewals and contingencies had been charged
against profits before the latter were shown. The
new practice, of course, puts the best possible face
on the current profits as shown in the first table. At
December, 1908, the co. had liquid assets totalling
£9975 and liabilities of £1292. a surplus of £8683 ;
as at December, 1913, the liquid assets were £BBB2
and liabilities £3199, a surplus of £5683. So that
during the five years the surplus of assets (apart
from land, plant and water rights) has shrunk by
£3OOO. And though in the same period the co. has
spent £14,275 on property, plant, etc., the unsatis-
factory feature is that the outlay hasn’t produced
any extra revenue; on the contrary, the revenue has
pretty steadily decreased,

The “A” and “B” shares are entitled to 10 p.c., if
the co. can pay it and still charge only 3s. 6d. per
1000 ft. for gas; and the limit for the “C” shares
is 7 p.c. unless the charge for gas is under 3s. 6d.
The “A” and “B” shares represent the old capital,
including reserves (visible and internal) capitalised
under the Gas Act of 1912. They amount to £275
for everv £lOO of old capital, so that even an 8
p.c. dividend is as good now as a 22 p.c. dividend
would have been prior to the changes caused by
recent legislation. But the shareholders are not
drawing quite 22 p.c. on the amount actually paid
by them, because part of the reserves that were
capitalised consisted of premiums paid for shares.
Giving that in, the return is remarkably good. For
the future, however, the only hope worth very much
is that the dividends on “A” and “B” shares may
be put up to 10 p.c., and on “C’s” to 7 p.c. They
can go beyond that, but to pay an extra \ p.c. the
price of gas must come down Id. below 3s. 6d. The
latter standard may, it is true, be raised if it can
be proved that Wages Boards’ awards have sufficiently
affected the cost of production. At present the
margin in excess of the dividend now paid is so
small that one wouldn’t expect an early rise in
divs.; on the other hand, it must be remembered
that, as most gas cos. are applying to raise the
standard price, the natural inclination would be to
show as small a profit as possible under existing con-
ditions. Apropos the accounts, this co. hasn’t yet
given the shareholders the advantage of the full in-
formation which it has to supply to the Department;
in that respect it differs from the Sydney co., which
in its published accounts now follows the schedule to
the Act. Dealing with the Sydney co.’s accounts
the other day The Bulletin remarked that for the
past half-year the management had charged £5OOO
to a Depreciation Fund, and it was questioned whether
there was any authority in the Act for establishing
such a reserve. There still doesn’t appear to be any
such authority in the Act (though there should be) ;
but in schedule 5 (“Revenue account’’) such an item
is provided for. Whether Act and schedule are in
conflict somebody else may fight out.

fed partly on the profits shown in the table as written
off, and partly on manna which drops from Heaven
or other ill-defined places: £7OOO fell into the
account in the early half of last year without men-
tioning what it was or where it came from. This
may have been special profit; on the other hand, the
whole of this reserve may be a mere set-off against
actual depreciation. Anyway, depreciation is not
apparently provided for otherwise, though, of course,
maintenance is charged to working ekes. Still, you
can’t “maintain” a pub or a brewery for ever; the
time comes when you can’t patch any longer, but
must have new pants. Hence, there ought to be
a depreciation (or, better still, a replacement) fund,
built up out of profits. This depreciation fund may
be that kind of thing, or it may be a leasehold
amortisation fund. It is too vague. What the
assets of the co. are like The Bulletin doesn’t
know, and therefore it can’t say anything as to the
security of any principal invested in this concern:
the trouble is that almost all the assets are thrown
into a heap, and how much of the £108,069 is re-
presented by intangible goodwill and water right and
how much by freehold properties is quite uncertain.
So far as profits are concerned, if they are as good
as they look they are exceedingly good. This paper
confesses that it doesn’t quite know how the thing
has been done; but, according to the published
accounts, the value of “freehold and leasehold pro-
perties, plant and machinery, rolling stock, goodwill,
water right and supply, etc.,” has increased from
£77,228 to £108,069 in 12 months, and, meantime,
no new share capital has been got in, and borrowed
capital has increased only from £5855 to £20,912.
If the balance has been provided out of ordinary
surplus profits in 12 months, then this co. is on
a good thing all right.

In 1904 the Board of Health required certain struc-
tural alterations, and the co. made the best of a
bad bargain by remodelling the whole place at a
cost of about £17.000. That meant an overdraft
and ether liabilities of £13,038 as at December,
1904, against which, however, there was £2718 in
cash and deposits. To-day, nine years later, though
no new capital has been got in, the liabilities (apart
from a few pounds of rent paid in advance) total
only £44, while cash and deposits amount to £2093.
Thus, though but lately a further £2OOO has been
spent in re-upholstering, etc., the cash position has
improved* by £12,413 in nine years. Unfortunately
the co. can’t regard that as surplus profit. The
trouble is that this co. only holds the bulk of the
property on lease; and though the latter runs well
past the middle of the century, the capital repre-
sented by leasehold and improvements has to be
restored out of profits within the period, or it is
liable to be lost for ever. There ought, of course, to
be a fund for restoring this capital; but so far the
money that might reasonably have been available
for the purpose has been mopped up by the improve-
ments and renovations mentioned above. From this
onward things should, however, improve, because
under the terms of the sub-lease to J. C. Williamson,
Ltd., which runs to 1928. this Theatre Royal Prop.
Co. had to spend the £2OOO on the renovation men-
tioned above, and a further small sum on extras, but
thereafter all repairs, renewals and decoration, apart
from structural alterations, have to be paid for by
the sub-lessees; and the rent goes up after 1918.
At present the leasehold and leasehold buildings stand
in the books at £34,200; and a sinking fund of
£lOOO a year, invested at 4 p.c., would wipe that
right out in 22 years. So, even providing for the
extinction of the capital debt on the leasehold in 22
years, a net revenue of £3OOO a year would pro-
vide the sinking fund and a 4 p.c. div. (which is
11 p.c. in excess of the present div.), leaving any-
thing in excess of £3OOO for contingencies. This
assumes that the ground rent will go on at the
£lBOO a year which has been paid hitherto. On
that point The Bulletin has no information.

The co. goes back 30 years, but it would do no good
to anybody to follow it there, since what happened
in the distant past can be no guide to the future,
the circumstances having changed completely. The
co. secured an area alongside the Stockton, partly
under the beach, partly under the ocean. The
expense of opening the mine and of keep-
ing it open was so great that, though the
coal was first-class and the output fair, the
dividends were usually only 5 Or 6 p.c. The two
shafts, which had to be “tubbed,” alone cost as much
to sink as should open up a mine. And then the

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The liardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, arid say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of. If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

the mine was going to last for repre-
thouo-h it dug out and sold the coal which repre
sented its capital, it didn't save up oI Jk« f r ? n
ceeds of the sales in order to return the capital in
monev when it was no longer represented by coal.
\s at December, 1908, when there were very grave
doubts whether the old mine would last
the latter still stood in the books at £lOO,OOO, and
the capital was only £123,665 To equip the new
mine it thus became necessary to borrow money on
debentures, and £40,000 is now owing on that
account. Still, the co. had good luck as well as
bad ; for the old Hetton is still workable, though the
.job is rather costly. There are still about 50 px
more men on Hetton than on Bellbird coal. But as
Hetton certainly can’t go on indefinitely, iainy
large sums are now being applied towards wilting
down the book value of the old property. Of course
this doesn’t mean that the money is thrown down the
shaft; it is being accumulated against the co. s
liabilities or is being put into the equipment of the
other property. The position now compares with
that of four vears ago in this way:—
1909. 1913.
Liquid and other assets, apart from _
the old Hetton property.. .. £37,997 £117,100
Liabilities .. .. • • • • 1,299 54,020
Surplus .. .. .. £36,698 £62,585
That shows an apparent improvement of nearly
£26,000 in four years; and, meantime, dividends
have been paid pretty regularly. The co. still has
a lot of leeway to make up ; the proper thing will
lie to go on writing down the old property out of
iirofits until at least enough of the latter are accumu-
lated to pay off the debenture debt. When that is
done the co. will have the moderate capital of
£ 123,665 represented by the Bellbird property, the
Hetton plant, and the more or less derelict old mine ;
and with the capital unencumbered, very fair divi-
dends should then be maintained —better, anyway,
than when the co. had a quicksand to drop its
money into. #
Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) has struck
4ft. of good wash in a working 577 ft. east of Allen’s
shaft, which is between the Rock shaft and the
upper boundary. At the end of January this work-
ing was in 18in. of wash worth 401 b., so it has
changed in 20ft. or so from poverty to comparative
riches. The increased output from the present block-
ing-out campaign had already put more heart into
this speculation, which has been debt-ridden from
the start ; but disappointments have been so persistent
that the market will not budge.
Another change takes place at Lloyd’s,
the N.S.W. copper mine which holds out promises,
hut never cashes them. Manager J. O. Armstrong
has retired, and Stanley Low takes charge.

The London mining director is a well-
greased guinea-pig. In fees the Rt. Hon. Earl who
is chairman of the Sulphide Corporation cuts up
£2500 a year with his four colleagues. But that
doesn’t satisfy them. “In accordance with the
articles of association” the directors draw a percentage
on dividends, and last year this put another £7500
into the five pockets, giving them £2OOO a .year
apiece. Payment on dividends is better, no doubt,
than payment on general expenditure; still, it is a
bad plan, inasmuch as directors may have far more
solid work to do under adverse conditions, when pro-
fits are nil or thereabouts, than when the concern
is in a patch of clover and a bit of mismanagement
or a whole lot of neglect doesn’t matter.
Hawkins Hill (N.S.W.), which, by the
way, sent its reserve shares to market some little
time ago, is still pegging along on its main level to
reach the cross-course; and 10 weeks or thereabouts
should decide whether the expected rich gold is there
or not. Long before then the battery—ls head of it,
anyway—should be going regularly on the 200 ft. of
reef which the drive has so far opened up.

Lake View South (W.A.) tells its share-
holders from London that the work done on its
Ivalgoorlie property during the past 18 months was
on a very small scale. Tributors are still in charge,
and the Board proposes to let them stay there.
Meantime, the co.’s affairs are being conducted at
what is termed a minimum of expense ; the directors
are even doing without their fees. The only other
asset the co. has are a few debentures in a concern
holding a half-share in a Klondyke venture which
has so far recovered £81,048.
Backed up by Government assistance and
the hank’s prayers. Phillips River (IV.A.) is fighting
hard for another lease of life. About 1000 tons of
ore have latelv been dumped at the smelters, and as
“splendid bodies of rich ore” are “known to exist in
other mines,” the place is tipped by its supporters to
go ahead. Undoubtedly there is a good deal of ore
showing, hut it is in the usual bunches, so far as
one can judge, and a continuous smelting campaign
is out of the question.
* * * *
Associated Northern (W.A.) has got
another attack of the creeps, and is obliged to give
up stoping at No. 4 level for the present. lhe
ground is “quiet” enough, but increased pressure
requires expensive timbering, and this under exist-
ing conditions makes too big a hole in the profits.
Onerations will, therefore, be suspended in the sul-
phide zone until a plant is installed. This means
12 months’ delay.
* * *
Last financial year North Kalgurli (W.A.),
yielded £22,300 from the treatment of tributors
ore, and the co. got £4OOO in royalties. In the
last six or seven years £145,000 has been dug out,
of which the co. has received £23,000 So far,
shareholders have not received a cent,. The co. has
enough cash in hand to pay a small div. ; but r ‘
ently its policy is to hoard up a bit more and then
splash it up on some foreign venture.
* * *
In the West the Great Boulder (W.A.) is
being growled at for going to Victoria in search ot
a new property. Still it has hunted round in the \\es„
for a long while, and the Stawell group sampled nearer
the owners’ estimate than anything it has ever tested in
Groperland. On the old mine things are no better.
Some deep boring recently done from the adjoining
Ivanhoe workings proved disappointing. The drill
met with nothing in the shape of lode-stuff, and
boring was stopped at 3232 ft. from the surface.
* * * *
A Melbourne crowd has acquired and
floated the Queen Ann lease at Southern Cross (W.A.).
Two large lode formations are visible, and sundry
parcels of ore taken from these bodies and treated
locally indicate that they are worth developing. The
purchase price was £lOO and a tenth interest in a
co. of 60,000 shares.

Lancefield (W.A.) has been re-christened
Beria Consols, and will in future be operated in
conjunction with the other industrial enterprises. ot
the new owners, the Kalgoorlie and Boulder Fire-
wood Co. New plant, including a big gas-producer,
has been ordered. #
Siberia Consols (W.A.) has got an exten-
sion of time for the payment of the £4OOO balance
due to vendors. Its due date was June 1 of this
year, but a new agreement just entered into pro-
vides for the payment of £lOOO at the end of 1914
and the remainder, as profits allow, by June, 1916.
Three months ago the co. had nearly £6OOO in cash,
so that if there is any gold left in the mine at all
the wiping off of its debt to the vendors should be
dead easy, and with ample funds in hand the sys-
tematic prospecting of the property made easier
still. Up to date the results have been disappointing.
Hannan’s Reward North (W.A.) is get-
ting talked about after a long silence. Nearly £5OOO
has been extracted from a new body ot ore within
the last two or three months, and, according to the
present owner, a good deal more wealth remains to
be taken out. This show was once owned by a
small weakly-financed Adelaide co., which made calls
and finally reconstructed itself out of existence.
Since then it has passed through many hands.
* ■* *
Burma Mines, Ltd., in which a lot of
good Lake View money was sunk, is at it again.
This time it is “considering the creation of £35,000
worth of 6 p.c. prior lien debenture stock. in
August last it got an advance of £35,000 by a first
prior lien mortgage on the slags at the mine,
agreed to repay the loan out of the first load sales.
The co. now wants to pledge its whole undertaking,
instead of the slags alone, and to postpone repay-
ment until the end of next year. The consent of
the stockholders has to be obtained, but this, it is
stated, has already been arranged.
* * *
A London opinion of Great Fingall’s posi-
tion: “A profit in sight of £50,000 or 4s. per
share. A cash balance of ss. i d. per share. A
prospective value of 6s. sd. per share. In other words,
with the market standing at 165., the value of shares
is represented by 36 p.c. cash assets 25 p.c. profit in
sight (at 10s. net per ton), and 40 p.c. prospective
value. On the basis of 10s. profit per ton, this
would presume the existence of another 160,000 tons
below the 18th level, pr a continuance of the size
and quality of the new ore shoot for another seven
levels. While the above estir ate assumes ani ore
reserve of 100,000 tons of 40s. ore above No. 18 level,
the official ere reserve estimate published six months
ago mentioned 50,000 tons only as actually in sight.
Worked out on this conservative basis, the continu-
ance of the new shoot would have to be assumed
for more than 10 levels below the 18th. Moreover, if
the plant were to run to its full capacity as in the
palmy days of the last decade, or at the rate of
20,000 tons per month, the ore reserve would be
exhausted in a very short time. Bmally, the fact
should not be overlooked that the new /olTveUhe
-s already out of the new shoot at the 18th level, the
shoot pitching farther away from it. ’ Word comes
from the West that the co. has taken a 12 months
option on the Big Bell group which the Great
Boulder turned down a few months-ago. #

Tinder the old regime it could at least be
said for Mount Morgan that it stuck to Austrahans
and, wherever possible, to Australian goods. the
appointment of general-manager ™^ sn JL a
violent departure from this policy, for, though Mag
nus is American, he had put in a fair time at . f d
tralian works. Now, however, Magnus is to be joined
by U. A. Garred, “a graduate in engineeringof the
University of Kentucky,’ and allegedly
years past chief engineer of the Anaconda. He
becomes chief engineer, “with charge of all '
ing work at Mount Morgan, Many Peaks. Marmor
and the coalmine at Blackwater. Adm }Hedly, things
haven’t gone well at Mount Morgan of late but that
has been due to the mishandling of the newlv
workman more than to anything else. Thenewly
imported Amurkan may know how to.get the: best
results from the material he will have to work with ,
if he does, he is the first imported Amurkan mining
boss of recent years who has the knowledge to start
with, anyway. # *
The first crushing this year from the
Vulcan (N.Q.) was 682 tons stone for 20 tons con-
centrates valued at £1558. Last year the mine
crushed 8863 tons for 332 tons concentrates worth
£28.694; average, £3 4s. 9d. per ton °r stone.
The Vulcan is being prospected at 1050 ft., but there
the drive shows only odd patches of tin worm
5 p.c.; the ore going to the mill comes from the
stones between 350 ft. and 900 ft., and the falling off
in the return is due mostly to the 350 ft. stope having
become lower grade. #
Charters Towers grabs now at almost any
straw on account of the poor results in the deep
levels. The biggest share-market turnover has lately
been in Clarks. This co. is driving at the 426 ft.
level on a small reef of. good quality. The last cut
is reported to have sin. of nice stone, and, as usual,
a specimen or two are shown around town to whoop
things up a bit. # *
At last Mount Oxide’s London deal looks
like completion, the weak and foolish Australians
who found the mine and developed it having been
mostly squeezed out. Oxide is another trumpet-
tongued argument against the bowelless thing called
British capital, especially when it has a curly nose
behind it. _ „
* * *
At Gympie the East Oriental and Glan-
mire is going to provide a little gamble. Slate fl° ors
below 2154 ft. are dipping to the east, and the coun-
try is more mineralised and favorable for gold. It is
a peculiarity of this field that the same reef is often
barren in one formation and rich in another, so a
favorable change in the country rock is frequently
accompanied by a rise in shares. A big formatio
carrying quartz leaders and a snnnkling of go 1 u
previously put the E. Oriental and Glanmire on the
dividend list ; hence the interest taken in the present
development. # *
The closing-down of Cbillagoe smelters
will give North Queensland a nasty knock. One way
and another 700 men will have to take the traek.
The co. tried to come at the Government for a loan
of £30,000, presumably to help with the line to the
Mulligan coal, and the construction of coke ovens,
etc ' but it had no luck this time. The story is
that’ coke and fuel are too expensive till Mulligan is
connected. Mulligan may help ; but the most serious
trouble is the scarcity of cheaply-won ore, and Ein-
asleigh is the only mine that holds out much hope
for the future.

Great Fitzroy (Q.) goes further and
further to the bad. December’s loss was £l5OO ;
January’s £l6lO. For January the furnaces ate
1631 tons of ore, showing 2.81 p.c. copper and 2.61
dwt. gold, and 1426 tons concentrates, showing
9.51 p.c. copper and 6.87 dwt. gold; and though
there was £12,492 in the lot, the expenses climbed
still higher and reached £14,102.

of oof to back a mining fancy. Cock’s lies at Eldor-
ado, and the drift to be sluiced is said to carry gold
and tin worth 9d. per cub. yard. A. H. P. Moline,
brought down from Y Water, Emmaville, is in con-
trol, and has the job of cutting a new channel for
the old creek that swamped out Jack Dane’s big
paddock. The duty of the new plant is to sluice
600,000 cub. yards of material, to lift it to the boxes
and to stack the tailings. Electricity is to do every-
thing except drive the power plant, where steam
power will rule. A bill of £23,000 will have to
be footed before the wheels go round. When the plant
is working, the big face of drift on which the old
barge is now doddering will melt away like snow
before the sun, for a huge output means solid pro-
fits. The project is a hobby of E. S. Robinson, jun.,
brother to Lionel; and when he next patronises this
side of the globe he will be able to tip the mine as
a promising beginner.

New Chum Goldfields, Bendigo, knocks
the bears out with Is. div. on top of a short run of
6d. payments. Mining pressmen of the Golden City
didn’t like the little mine too well, and, as they are
an outspoken lot, they let the world know their
opinions. The best gold has been got off a big spur
that junctions with the east leg of the saddle, lhe
stranger was picked up in the intermediate level
below 1076 ft. What the bears rely on is that the
leg will get down to its old 3 dwt. value once the
stopes go beyond the influence of the spur. If so, it
will be bad luck for Bendigo, for gold in an outside
show like the Goldfields brings in fresh interests to
a weary crowd of eallpayers.

Great Poseidon Alluvial (Vic.) mustn’t
be confounded with Poseidon Alluvial. The latter
has a shaft, the former hasn’t. Great Poseidon has
been trying to freeze its way down, but cash hasn t
been too plentiful for the expensive operation. How-
ever, the circle of bores is down, the brine has in it
all the sodium chloride reauired, the coolers and con-
densers are up, and the refrigerating plant is ready to
be shoved along at ton speed. A tangle therefore has
been gradually straightened out, so that, with th_
funds available, the co. should before long freeze the
ground, sink the shaft, and then hey for the lead.
After that, what will be got when the lead
been reached? That point may before then b
answered by work at the Poseidon Alluvial next
door, where, however, the water problem is still a
tough one. # *
Toole, at the New Langi (Vic.), didn’t
get into the gutter from his incline dijive off 'the
top of the rise, but had to go south to let the lead
weep a few tears over his cautious wooing, rrom
the inches of bottom showing at the top laths he
snicked a grab sample of the wash that gave iclwt.
gold. If this be a representative test of the gutter,
the Madame Berry would be a lay figure beside the
New Langi. Bill Toole meanwhile is content to
guess that the gutter should yield at least 2oz. per
fathom. If it does, Victoria is in for another deep-
lead boom, with plenty of spare cash for the flutter.
The weak point is that the gutter where the few inches
were pouched is 1000 ft. wide, and the rise went up
between two specially good bores. If 2oz. dirt hadn t
been got, the sound of the fall of scrip would have
been heard in Ulster. * #
At present there are 200 osmiridium
miners on the west coast of Tasmania, and most of
them are said to be doing very well. The market
price, which was 10s. an ounce for years, has rise
rapidly to £ll. The demand increases faster than
the output, although the biggest specimen of pure
osmiridium in the world, weighing loz. ITdwt.was
only lately discovered. This is in the Passion of
TT "B Silberberg and Co., of Melbourne, along witn
seven" other pieces ranging from ISdwt. These came
from the Bald Hills district (Tas.). Tw ° of ,
smaller specimens have been bought by local
museums, but the prize packet, now at Fairfax and
Roberts’s (Sydney), will probably go to some Euro-
pean collector. Scientific and surgical instruments
are tipped with osmiridium. Likewise fountain pens.
It serves to harden platinum. _ An acid

as to the metal being used for tipping projectile ,

wire has been sent by the Association to the Minister
for External Affairs: “You are reported in the JN.I.
Times as - having told a press representative that
the proposed battery for Maranboy is in abeyance,
pending inquiries and reports. Sufficient payable
stone is in sight to keep the battery going for years.
In the opinion of experienced tin-miners, Maranboy
is as good as any tinfield in Australia, and has done,
and will do, more to attract genuine workers to the
Territory than any Government farming or settling
policy costing thousands. Your Government, m
delaying mining assistance with the battery, is break-
ing faith with Territory miners.” #
The vaguest prospectus that ever was

have nothing to sell except a misty belief that on
some unnamed river in some unspecified island there
is gold to be got. Two unmentioned mining engineers
are said to have reported that there is gold there
(not payable gold or gold in quantities, but just
gold), and the promoters merely ask for four-fifths
of the substance that is in the bag—it may be a
pig’ or it may be a delusion. Company-promoters
faith in the confidence of the public is very touching.

LETTER
Sydney, February 16, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
Grazier Ernest White’s will has been
proved. at £158,354 —a tidy sum for the
struggling land-holder to put together. The
late Mr. White, of Belßrees Station, was
more popular in Scone and the adjacent
countryside than any other member of a
wealthy sheep-farming family which is not
given to reckless expenditure in the cause of
charity.
, A Scone correspondent remarks, “Ernest
Y\ hite was addicted to doing kind deeds ?f
he was approached in the right way. He
hasn t left a penny to the town or to any
charity, however. No one expected that he
would, for the Whites, who have made their
fortunes in this district, keep a tight grip
on their cheque-books. Ernest was a con-
firmed bachelor, and had long been the de-
spair of match-makers in the district. Appen-
dicitis was the cause of his death Thp

to grow them up here.”
I like that statement that the late
lamented would do good deeds if approached

that the right way of approach is up an

Sydney, like Melbourne, is taking the
lango so seriously—you’ve got to take it
seriously, for it is hard labor—that schools
of the cult are beginning to bud in various
suburbs. The first few lessons leave the
victim a limp heap of collapse, with a dis-
jointed feeling about the hips, and the gen-
eral appearance of a rag doll with its stuffing
knocked out. When the patient feels better
he or she settles down to slog steadily at

The Meat Strike or beef famine is in very
delicate health. It seems to me that the
flesh insurrection is likely to come to a
sudden end. The proposition of switching
off every meat supply from a great city, and
a tremendously meat-eating city at that
even for three or four days, should cause a
movement of this kind to break down with
the weight of its own carcases. The animal-
hood habit has got the butcher-men just as
it has their customers, and when a confirmed
consumer of chops cuts off his own pro-
vender to spite his face, he presently becomes
angry with himself.
The Nightingales’ referendum on the sub-
ject of raising trained nurses’ fees to three
g r 1 ?oo S fl a eek has . result ed in a majority
of 400 for the uprising of an income which
at present averages £B5 a year. This is the
figure computed by a nursing authority of
*e l°ng experience of Miss Helen Gould.
With the increase a nurse who has spent
tour years_ (at a nominal wage), learning
her profession may hope to gather up £l2O t
year. This allows for the weeks she is liable
to be out of work, or too knocked out to
hump her basket from one sick-bed to
another.
, Sydney nurses complain that they have
had the big dailies against them in this
matter, though they only ask for a wage
that bungs them a little nearer to the
weekly earnings of an unskilled manual lab-
orer. Most nurses are working for their
livmg. They cannot afford to be philan-
thropists any more than the people who pre-
vent disease by digging drains, or the folk

( Marthe Troly-Curtin. who wrote
I hrynette and London,” jots down in The
Sketch a racy impression of a woman’s
meeting in London. The object was the
betterment of woman’s lot. Mrs. Sidney
Webb, the lecturer, was prodding at the
mistaken kind of education that girls have
always received “which tends to teach them
to make themselves attractive to men.” For
example, the hampered waist of years ago.
and the hampered feet of to-day, are some of
the mistakes mentioned.
Says Marthe, “Does not Mrs. Sidney
Webb know that it is not woman, but man.
who invented and rendered possible the
hampered waist and tight skirt? Men sang
of wasps’ waists, of willowy slenderness,
never of beautiful broad-flanks. The magni-
ficent back of the Yenus de Milo would not
appeal ,to one man in a thousand at the
present time, nor would her strong and noble
neck, her serene face, her restful body, her
large and perfect feet. In truth, man - loves
beauty no longer. It has to be disguised if
not destroyed before it can be acceptable to
him. Why then hint at his superiority?”

illustrates one conclusive reason why they
should not part for ever, by showing Him
in the act of kissing Her eyelashes.

VANDORIAN.
“Binnacle”: Yet another Newcastle coal-
laden ship has fled off the surface of human
ken without the slightest trace. That is the
German barque Seestern, which left N. S.
Wales some months ago for an American
port. Whether the dangerous cargo caught
hie or shifted will never be known
until the sea gives up its debris and
its souls. Fire or founder—it is all the
same now, and it is doubtful if it will be
any better later on. The name Seestern is
unlucky. Another steamer of that name, a
beautiful yacht used for German Govern-
ment purposes, left Sydney for German
iapua three years ago. It is still at large
somewhere.
Another horror on the Vic. railways. Re-
cently a girl of 16 was sitting placidly in a
Brighton train when a human severed hand
flew in at the window and splashed in her
face. It had an instant before been the
property of a small girl 10 years old who
had been waving it from the window of an
adjacent carriage. A swinging door on a
passing train did the rest. The younger
girl died an hour later, and perhaps her
luck was the better. The shock to the other
was such that it is doubtful if she will ever
be_ a normal, sane woman. The coroner
said, “Accidental death.” The Railway De-
partment points to regulation Z 1174, which
forbids passengers pushing their extremities
through apertures in the carriages. So far
the swinging door has made no remarks.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, February 16, 1914.
My Dear Yarhie, —
A lord or a duke or something has been
wandering round Melbourne prosaically buy-
ing wool and avoiding the title-worshippers
whose animals grow it. He suffers from
gout (which may or may not be his reason
tor avoiding our alleged Society), and the
other morning he limped into the wool-
buyers’ temple, leaning heavily on a stick
and wearing one foot in a red slipper. He
subsided gratefully into the seat of a young
man who buys for somebody in America,
and when the rightful owner came along
there was a sharp and furious argument, for
there is a very strict unwritten law which
forbids trespassing. However, the gouty one
exhibited the sick foot pathetically, anil the
other withdrew as gracefully as possible.
The swearing-in (or whatever it is) of
the new State Excellency Stanley (his first
name is Lymph, I think) happens on Mon-
day, February 23, when a lot of carefully-
selected unemployed people will be on hand
to watch. There will be a crush, of course.
Even a well-worn and familiar cocked hat
draws a crowd ; but with a brand-new poten-
tate to gaze on the crowd is certain to be
immense and feathered beyond all reason.
The A.N.A. educational exhibition was
opened in the same old way on Saturday
afternoon by the little G.-G., who looked
sick, or perhaps he was just hot and bored,
llis lady and the whole of the house party
were enjoying themselves at breezy Caui-
field, and naturally that’s where he longed
to be also. Chairman Embling made some
superfluous remarks for which Denman later
thanked them all in a hesitating way. He
also thanked them for dragging him away
from Caulfield and making him tired by
showing him fifty thousand things in a heap.
Sometimes he spoke like a man whose very
soul was yawning, and Help Curwen, sitting
close by in a uniform which was far too
tightly laced with gold braid, had no sugges-
tions to make. But his Ex. still struggled
along gamely, even when, for want of some-
thing else to say, he had to drag at his fin-
gers and confess that he “wasn’t much good
at education.” The audience was given to
understand that he had the ruins of his edu-
cation packed away somewhere at home, but
it really wasn’t worth calling round to in-
spect it. Madden, sitting alongside, looked
sympathetic, and seemed to be wondering
how any human being could be at such a
loss for mere words. John himself always
has a plate of buttered ones ready. Gaud
Mayor Hennessy smiled Perpetually, and a
handful of women (one woman is a handful
for most men) tiptoed in in time to drink
George V.’s health in lukewarm gingerale,
while a pretty but belated waitress rushed
towards them with ice. The Creswell dame,
drooping wearily in black, after her hard
work in the Arts and Crafts gallery, was
accompanied by the usually icebergy' Mary
Chomley, who seemed to have been melted
by the heat. Chairman Emblitig’s wife was
a fair, cool vision in white muslin, and three
Embling children sat properly with their
nurse and refrained from violence or fidget-
ing. The thing lasted a fearful time, and
it is doubtful if the poor G.-G. even saw the
last race.
Caulfield races, on Saturday last, were
not officially on the Best People’s honor list,
but the dresses and plug hats turned up
m battalions and made it one of the fashion-
able events of the young year. The vice-
regal enthusiasm is good for the horse-
racing game, and snobs hurry along to all
sorts of minor meetings. The Denman
dame, whose little G.-G. was sweltering
dutifuHy at the A.N.A. show, deserted the
official crate most of the afternoon and
walked about the paddock with a cool touch
ot moss green in her costume and a train of
devoted Gentleman Helps. Burnham, how-
ever, was free to roam with Margaret Niall
and drink squashes with her in the shade.
(Comedian Will Whitburn used to sing a
mock sentimental song which began: “The
prettiest girl that ever I saw was sucking cider
through a straw.” I remembered it on Satur-
day). There was such a rush on cool, teetotal
drinks that the outcast flat had to be appealed
to for extra lemons. Sep Miller’s horse
Laheen bolted riderless almost round the
course, and when brought back started off as
fresh as ever and won his race. Mrs. Sep
simply danced with delight, and, as she is
young and a good dresser, the performance
was very popular with those who saw it.
Her dancing costume was topped by a simple
Panama hat, with schoolgirl tails of black
velvet hanging down the back. Mrs. Alan
Lurrie and Mrs. Jim Purves exchanged con-
fidences in a shady corner of the stand. The
wife of Dr. Joyce looked like a pink ice-
cream—-and I was very grateful to her for it.
i simply hated another woman who looked
like a round of beef. She looked terrible be-
side a woman friend garbed in cool white,
who closely resembled a dish of junket. Then
there-was a raspberry-tart girl—but enough !
I an Dango Macka.v went down to the bird-
cage, and natted Radnor, her husband’s horse,
on its distinguished nose, but the nag
couldn t manage to win even with that bit of

Listen to the Great advertising! “His
Excellency took his opportunity of mention-
ing that there was to be an exhibition in the
ballroom of Government House next month,
of antique furniture, old silver, and things of
that kind He hoped that generous sup-
port would be given to it (Cheers).” That
m,\ dear, is the daily paper report of G -G'
Denman s ?P e <r ch at the A.N.A. performance
ot last Saturday. Of course you knew be-
fol eh and that they were holding a little
show of their own.
General lan Hamilton, who has witnessed
at: least, one lamentable local military show
ms appeared to the toiling public mostly as'
one oi four helmets in a passing motor-
car. However, on Saturday night, he got
into conventional evening dress and sat in a
S?* at tb e for the inspection of
theatre-goers. Then he was seen to be a
veiy thin, pleasant-looking man with a grev
waxed moustache. He was accompanied by
2 a “ be, ' ] “. n N evill, and both of them at-
M T ISS Hugessen, who gambolled
piettilj. In the pen above, the Denman
dame sat in pea-green clothes. The Grev
Countess sat beside her and looked out
Su y fron ; wrappings' of puce-petunia,
JS?® ber , earl at her elbow looked as much
like a duke as he could. He is a very tall,
S WU V a u efl fac e, a sloping forehead
and not much hair. Not that it really
matters If anyone can do without hair
it should be an earl. All the week he had
been .making speeches over broken victuals
delaying the ceremony of washing up
while he constructed remarks that could not
be twisted and the pleasant platitude that
m as safe as morning porridge. Hair won’t
grow under such conditions.
An extremely young engagement is an-

Monday March 2, is the date of the big
wedding of the month—the Burnham-Niall
affair. I hen, before Society has had time
to get its breath, Charlie McEvoy’s girl
Dorne and Guy Madden do their stunt. That
outburst is dated for March 10. When the
stupendous alliance has been consummated
Mamma Madden goes off to England for a
Lip in company with her youngest daughter,
Mrs. Jack Bailheu and Mrs. Jack’s husband.
Plump and serious-minded Ivy Clarke is
taking a kind of hereditary interest in the
City Newsboys, of whose society the late
Janet Mrs. Clarke was one of the first
presidents. During the week, Ivy “shouted”
the youngsters a picnic to Rye, whither thev
journeyed by the Lady Loch. A luncheon
to the committee and guests was given on
board. Edith Onians, the secretary of the
society, for whom the slightly-rolling deep
hath no charms, made the trip to Rye by
motor with Mrs. John Murray. This lady’s
more completely exhausted half could not
come owing to having overslept himself or
something.
Civilisation’s latest, the afternoon Tango
lea at half a crown a head, reached us at
last on Ihursday, and the struggle to get in
was memorable. Curiosity is the best draw
ot all. A heated management declined to
hold seats after curtain-rise, and the stam-
pede ot the Great Unbooked into the vacant
places made the ushers look like dazed tally-
men at shearing time. The dilatory moto-
cracy undulated up the stairs later, only to
lind their seats crammed full of staring
strangers. It was no use protesting either.
i r *u w ? s no shifting the claim-jumpers,
ancl the late arrivals had either to retreat
downstairs or stand. The sensational item
or the afternoon was the parade of girls in
undergear constructed mostlv of silk, mull-
muslin and Valenciennes. When it came to
tlie top-dressing, the new clothes were seen
to be bunchy. A Tango dress needs width
and heaps of gathers, but tulle and chiffon
(both perishable stuffs) are the only possible
coverings one can treat so and stili be fash-
ionably underclad. Tea and ices were rushed
round the auditorium by flustered waitresses
in the intervals, while a bald individual with
massive trousers- announced the new items.
Ihe demonstrating Tango maiden was tall,
and shewed off some beautiful garments. A
black and white arrangement was practically
nothing but fringe and a wisp of tulle. Then
she showed a neat tan tailor-made, out of
which she thrust one silk-stockinged limb bv
means of a slit almost waist-high. Black tights
were glimpsed underneath. The house sat
and_ stewed patiently through the afternoon,
hoping all the time for Something Worse
S°t The two Tango exponents
ushed back to Sydney by the afternoon ex-
press tor a week-end demonstration; but
they are expected to return and show Mel-
bourne a few more of the alleged 72 steps.

Une guinea reserves one seat for each re-

—quite a bargain-counter offer, in fact. Bv
the _ way, Goll has succeeded Scharf
as piano teacher at the Marshall Hall Con-

somewhat prohibitive height. Scharf went

murmured a recent female spectator, wlio
was too absorbed to choose her words care-
tuily. Ihese evenings there is just the
faintest hint of tango in the two-step, and it
goes unchecked by the management, which at
first had to be more careful than the average
suburban vestry. The Best are now hoping
for the Worst—though the blessed dance has
been so carefully conventionalised that there
is hardly any Worst in most versions of it
Every evening small expeditionary parties
from ioorak arrive to praise the floor, gyrate
and see how much further the regulations
have relaxed.
The stoutly sentimental Napoleon Boffard,

dog may find he is dragging a baron behind

of the kind. The animal was presented to
kjPppky Mrs. Gordon Holmes, the owneress

Boffard magnanimously calls his pet Bis-

shouldn’t So far as I know, Bismarck
never said that he couldn’t sing.
Ivan Archer Rosenblum is about to show

The Victorian slice of the J. J. Duncan estate has

Walter Hackett, one of Adelaide’s rich men, died
a day or two ago, aged 87. He made his money out
ot seeds and flowers—had a nursery at Marrvattville
which is built all round nowadays, and a quiet sea-
side home with a half-mile avenue of big gums at
Brighton. There are sons to carry on the business ;
but as long as he could turn over a ledger or value
a sample of grain—which was until the other day—
the silent old man kept his grip on the affairs of a
firm which is one of the ancient institutions of South
Aus.
Yours sincerely,

“.Ssculapius”: In ancient Greece they used to
erect temples over natural springs and give to each
a titular diety. We moderns are no less appreciative
of the healthful virtues of a mineral water —only our
methods differ somewhat. For instance, up at the
famous Helidon Spring, the water is secured just as
it bubbles up from the earth, and hermetically sealed
until the process of aeration and bottling is com-
plete. You don’t need a Greek fineness of palate to
appreciate the cool charm of Helidon Spa—it has
the same delicious refreshingness to Billjim as to the
Earl of Hopetoun. As a blender with wines and
spirits, too, it gives just that added snap and
sparkle that counts so much in the sum of pleasant-
ness. You’ll be wise to always make it a practice to
Figaro : Read a par. here the other week about
Nature planting the giant stinging nettle in N.Q.,
but close beside it the tree whose leaves serve as an
antidote to its sting. This provision of Nature is
in no way unique, for, just as she curses us with
indigestion so she blesses us with Helidon Spa.
After dining out you’ll have no next morning head-
ache if you take a bottle of “Helidon” before turning
ln this delicious mineral water is Nature’s gift to
those who have dined not wisely but too well. A single
glass will dissolve the undigested food and at the
same time ensure a perfect night’s rest. Quite apart
from its health aspect, “Helidon” greatly enhances
the flavor of wines and spirits—so truly the way of
wisdom is always to
SPLIT IT WITH

A PARADOX.
No. 1: " Hullo a!! What's up? ”
No. 2: “A 'orse is down. Thais what's up."
Vigilans : I see another authority, with
MD. after his name, has arisen to remark that a
man to make a do of things in the Northern Terri-
tory must be constitutionally like a procession of
lions and elephants ; he must be in perfect health ; his
habits must be tremendous; he must be an absolute
devil on morality ; and he must be so temperate that
he eats nothing and drinks less, and never sits down.
He must, in short, be a picked man. To which I
say bandicoots.” I know a dozen men who went
to the North because they could not live in the
South. Men with slight consumption, asthma, bron-
chitis and weak chests. Are they dead? Not much
They are very alive. As for drink, there is more
square gin consumed up there for the population
than anywhere else in the universe. Perfect habits!
Men get wet through three or four times a day and
dry in the sun. A bark humpy is the usual abode or
a roughly-pitched fly. Old Blaire lived years under
a bark roof with no sides. Personally, I never had
better health than during my four years wandering
in the North. I rarely slept in a bed ; most of the
time I lay on the hard ground with a saddle for a
pillow. My habits were quite imperfect, but they
made me strong and healthy. The wandering, hard
life of the North changed me from a city dude to a
man. I even became a bloke. I walked from Derby
to Wyndham. Got bushed twice; was three days
without water and five without food. I walked up
the coast from Broome to Beagle Bay with only a
singlet and dungarees on me; I must have swam 30
creeks, was always more or less wet, and was half-
devoured by mosquitoes. I rode by myself from Pine
Creek to Charleville (Queensland) with two horses.
I slept anywhere, lived hard on johnnie-cakes, salt-
junk and post-and-rail tea. Drank any kind of out-
back poison when it was there. Was moral occa-
sionally. And I’m still going strong.
A story of old dead-and-gone Oom Paul of
®’ Afri f • * co u u P le of Boers, brothers, had a
farm left to them. They had employed surveyors
who had divided the land mathematically, but'still
the brothers were not satisfied. So they decided to
consult Oom Paul. He told them that the affairs of
the State were too pressing to admit of his goin«-
wL , e „ ? r U ” ; ,“ But which of you is the elder
other he asked. “I am,” replied Piet. “Then
you go back, divide the farm, and give your brother
the first choice. Solomon in all his gilded exhaus-

and sliding back into the water. Which goes to sup-
port a recent Bulletin writer’s contention that the
Queensland lizard is a timid reptile after all. On one
occasion, when the Proserpine River was in flood, the
writer and two others were sitting on the outer edge of
watchln £ the hig lo " s racing down the stream.
The water was just level with the floor-boards of the
wharf Hearing a regular swish-swish behind us we
turned and nearly went into a panic on seeing a 16ft
croc, marching along towards us. We all promptly
jumped up, and our sudden action scared the brute

dcncr 77 f jear ''n : If an y bod y’s looking for evi-
d-ncc that small pox among the aboriginals
Detore the arrival of
white men he should turn
to James Kirby’s “Old
Times in the Bush of Aus-
tralia.” In chapter XXIII
that pioneer wrote: “The
man (aboriginal) we
named Sir Robert Peel
was a tall, fine fellow,
deeply pock-marked. We
noticed that several of the
blacks were pock-marked,
but those who bore these
marks were all old men.”
This is written of the
Swan Hill (Vic.) blacks,
the date being 1845 or
_ ... 46 ; an <k since only old men
were marked, the epidemic must have been back at
° f the century. As Victoria was not
t • y , earS aft6r that ’ U seems fairJ y cer tain
that Bmghi knew what small pox was before white
brother was on hand to give him the introduction.
* * •
“T.H.” : Somebody was asking about black-
fcHows ovens recently. Back in the old days along
the Murray and Loddon rivers, where for miles no
stones could be found, our primitive brother cooked
his rations thuswise: a hole was made in the ground •
it was about 9ft. in circumference and about 9in’
b!n P ’ W 'L u loP J ng Sides ‘ Then a su PP J y mud
balls, each about as big as a man’s fist, was prepared,
sun-dned and well heated on a fire. These were
rolled into the excavation until it was paved. Upon
them were laid ’possum, fish, or whatever was in
season, and covered with a layer of grass, a layer of
leaves and a layer of hot ashes. I’ve never seen
better results from a white man’s oven. The mud
balls are used only once, and I have seen piles of
them Bft. high along the rivers mentioned.
* * * .
A suggestion that a white man trained to
the game can beat any black-tracker has called out
a host of contradictions in Adelaide. Captain
White, the naturalist, says that, on his recent
expedition, the blackboys tracked camels over the
gibber country, where the stones for miles are
pressed down like mosaic, and the spongy foot of
the camel passed over it without making the least
impression.” As for tracking ants—an idea which
had been represented as comic—White found that his
followers accepted the job as a matter of course
when he told them he wanted different breeds
of the insect. South, the S. Aus. Protector of Abor-
igines, was formerly a trooper in charge of black
trackers, and hands them a big testimonial. They
have given an escaped prisoner 13 days’ start, and
then run him down; even his changes of horses
were at once clear to them. They have followed
hoofmarks through a perfect maze made by a mob.
Other blackfellows gave them the most trouble.
They can track the scuttling lizard and describe it
before they see it; in fact, South thinks some of
the most brilliant work is done by piccaninnies,
when they are out after food. From 25 to 30 is
however,, the best age, as a rule, and the real
tracker is the chap from Outside, who distrusts even
Alice Springs as a gay metropolis, and gets uneasy
when asked to stay anywhere for a month.
ALL THAT WAS LACKING.
FIRE INSURANCE AGENT: "Here is your fire insurance policy , Mr. Cohen. See anything

MR. COHEN: “Vell,

G.V.W.” : What is a boy? I see that the
average height of the 51 “boys” now being imported
by the Massey Government for the M.L. cocky is
sft. 6in., while one is 6ft. 2in. long and weighs 13st.
Another is 6ft. and 12st., and a third is sft. lOJin.
by lineal measure and 124 st. by the avoirdupois table.
For the first year these “boys” are to get 7s. 6d. per
week; Is. of this is pocket-money, and the balance
must be banked until the total reaches £lO, when
the “boys” must refund it to their cocky-employer
who is paying their fares out. The second year

they are to get 12s. 6d. and the third year 17s. 6d
after which they are free to buy a farm or a station
or two of their own with their savings. It is a fine
scheme, and Cocky is reckoning to dodge the Arbitra-
tion Act with it, because the present Arbitration
Court is certain to exempt these “boys” from the
provisions of any award. The only fly i n Cocky’s
treacle is that he has to feed and clothe the “boys,”
and, being on the large size, they will eat a lot and
take a deal of covering. Meanwhile what sort of a
country is it which exports that kind of “boy”?
Masarcus : Don’t know who started this
slow-train competition, but I reckon I’ll finish it
when I nominate the Northern Murchison line
(W.A.). From Midland Junction to Geraldton,
travelling by the steam hearse is bad enough, but
from Geraldton on to Meekatharra the boiler fire is
put out and the train is drawn by cows and lame
dogs. Over the distance of 320 miles the Flying
Backslider is scheduled to rage in about 21 hours;
but mostly it limps in between four and eight hours
late. Nevertheless, there are some compensations
to the passenger. Supposing, for instance, the train
has pulled up at some small
station on which there is no
refreshment booth. All the
thirsty one has to do is to
ask the engine-driver to wait
half an hour while he mean-
ders over to the hotel. That
is done at Nannine nearly
every trip. Then again, if the
traveller wants a shot at a
wild turkey along the track,
he borrows a rifle from the
guard, and the procession is
suspended while he stalks his
prey. Sometimes the engineer
joins the hunt. Only once has
the Meekatharra - Geraldton
train been known to be on
time. That was when the
District Superintendent made
a trip. On that occasion resi-
dents of the various towns
along the line were seriously
inconvenienced. They had got
into the habit of setting their
clocks by the arrival of the train, generally reckon-
ing on her being three hours late. Next morning
many of them got up at four o’clock under the
impression it was seven or thereabouts.

“Billy T.”: The Bulletin does not over-
do the idea of the rural galoot’s infatuation where
his divinity is concerned. My friend took a few
books up with him on his Christmas holiday, and
lent Clarke’s “For the Term of His Natural Life” to
the son of the house where he was staying, a cum-
bersome yob of 25. The native said he had heard of
the book, and made an effort to read it, but returned
it presently. “Ain’t true or nacheral,” he said.
“Uv read 200 pages, and no cow in it l”

BEALE PIANOS.
The facff that to-day we are the largest piano firm doing business in the Commonwealth is diie solely to the
quality of our instruments.
No effort has been spared in the manufacture of Beale Pianos to reach perfection of tone and ensure
durability. To-day our instruments stand absolutely unrivalled in those respects.
Beale Pianos are specially designed and made to meet all the exigencies of the Australian climate. They
embody every improvement known in piano construction, and are made under the direct supervision of an expert who
has made scientific piano manufacture a life study. In addition, they possess special features which you cannot get in
other pianos ; such as our permanent steel tuning-system, hexagonal bass-strings, patent cast-in hitch-pins, and our
patent method of building up the casework.
The Beale Permanent Steel Tuning System renders what was hitherto the weakest part of a piano the strongest.
In every Beale Piano the wrest-plank is made of solid iron. The wrest-plank is that part of the piano into which are
driven the tuning pins to which are attached the wires (or strings ). In every impoited piano the wrest-plank is
made of wood, which has to bear the strain (about 20 tons) of all the wires when the piano is in tune. So that in every
piano that has a wooden wrest-plank there is a probability of the wrest-plank splitting and the piano becoming untunable
in consequence. And in every piano but the Beale the wrest-plank is made of wood.
In all Beale Pianos the wrest-plank is solid iron, a part of the iron frame itself.
Write for our special booklets explaining this matter in detail.
We have recently put on the market the Beale Player-Piano. The Beale Player-Piano possesses the finest
mechanism it is possible to produce, fitted in a Beale high-grade piano of handsome appearance. The artistic possi-
bilities of the interpretation of a roll on the Beale Player-Piano are limited only by the artistic temperament of the
performer. The mechanism is so delicately regulated and every control so perfecff that it is easier to play than any other
piano-player.
FREE LIFE INSURANCE : We supply, when requested, a Free Life Insurance Policy, without any charge
whatever, to buyers of Beale Pianos. This covers the life of the customer during the course of hire-purchase, and
insures a valuable and saleable asset to the family without further payment in case of bereavement. The Policy is a
purely free gift from Beale and Co., Ltd., so that no other person may claim under it than the person named by the
customer when accepted by us.
All Beale Pianos carry our written guarantee for Twenty-five Years.
A Beale Piano is lower in price, quality for quality, than any other piano you can buy, and in after cost it is
also cheaper, because it requires far less tuning and less frequent expert attention in every way.
PARTS : Should you by accident damage your Beale Piano we can always replace any injured or broken
parts at a very low cost to you, because we are the actual makers, with our fadlory facilities here in Australia. But if
you buy an imported piano, and it gets damaged, you will find it expensive to repair, because the agents have no factory
facilities here and they do not carry stocks of spare parts.

A SCRAP OF PHILOSOPHY AND A
PLUG HAT.
BILL (in the background): “ Blime , 'Orace!
It’s surprisin' wot a man'll but up with
w’en 'ee's got ter."
“Te Babarantiko” : I can endorse “Lagani
Namo’s” assertion (B. 29/l/’l4) that a 20ft. dive
is not much to skite about. All through the Islands
you find excellent divers among the natives. On the
phosphate islands in the Central Pacific, where there
is a good deal of rule-of-thumb work about the
moorings, I have had natives go down six fathoms—
and work, too. Four fathoms is considered a mod-
erate depth to work in. And I have known white
men beat the niggers at the game. The native diver
takes no header to gain impetus—he just describes
a semicircle on the surface, after swallowing a huge
gulp of air, pinches his nostrils between two fingers,
and works his way down with powerful strokes of
arms and legs. Some claim to be able to go down
10 fathoms, but I have never seen it done; a good
diver is too valuable for that kind of thing, anyway.
The. deep-diving Kanaka always becomes hard of
hearing and suffers from headaches. He also insists
that it is easier to dive in shallow water than to
dive to the same depth in very deep water —-which
seems feasible enough. On the Rio Santos, South
America, I have seen Indians go down along a bamboo
pole stuck into the mud in peasoup water 30ft. deep,
and grope about the bottom for lumps of coal or
anything else dropped from vessels discharging cargo.
The diver who is on this lay takes a little basket,
which is hauled up by his mate and taken down
again when the diver has had his blow. About the
Malacca Straits, and well into the Malay Archi-
pelago, you can contract with naked divers to scrape
the marine growth off your vessel’s bottom, and they
make a good job of it, too.
For thousands of years mankind has allowed its
bread to become stale regarding staleness as unavoid-
able. It now appears however that staleness is due
to exposing bread to varying temperatures. Dr.
Katz’s experiments (see Scientific Australian) show
that if stored at 60 degrees Cent, bread will keep
new for 40 hours while at 30 or 40 it becomes only
"half stale.” He recommends the keeping of new
bread at 50 degrees. An exciting problem, day
baking, may thus be solved. Phillips Ormonde & Co.,

AN ACQUITTAL.
HIS WORSHIP: “But tell
me what he said to you. I
want his exact words. Did he
distinctly say, ‘I stole the fowls?’”
PERSON IMPLICATED (greatly agitated): “Gord love yer, yer washup, ’e never so much
as mentioned yer name."
“Hamel’’': Australian snake-expert Fox is
looking for new worms to conquer, and his search
has taken him to India, where the deadly cobra lives.
While in the Malay Settlements Fox is alleged to
have had 1 a battle With a cobra, and to have been
bitten by the animal; but his “cure” is said to
have proved efficacious. Anyhow, he is still alive.
‘lt speaks a great deal for his confidence in his anti-
dote that he is willing to tackle a proposition like
the cobra; and if there isn’t a dead Fox in India
shortly, he is. likely to get more advertisement,
revenue and profit in a few weeks than he secured
in Australia in many years.

“Inabit”: “Sarto” (B. 15/1/’l4), having
been so kind as to tell “Kodak” the name of the
strange bird he saw, will perhaps oblige
me in the same way. I have only seen
my bird twice, and each time it was late
at night. I first met it on a lonely road.
It was perched on the bough of a tree,
using a crosscut saw. I applauded its
efforts, whereupon it pressed a button
and the ship lit up with red and green
lights. Rockets went up at intervals.
Pressing another button the squadron of
giraffes withered away altogether, and the
sky lighted up. Fiery dragons, angels
with flaming swords, black-winged imps,
green scorpions and a host of mis-shapen
things danced the stately minuet. One
couple, a fantod and a winged snake,
started the Tango ; but a policeman with
white whiskers grabbed them, and they
all went into the night in a heap,
dragging the furniture with them. Bill
Jones was with me at the time. When I
next saw the bird I was at Murphy’s,
and it dew out from Hogan’s pint. It
hung in the air for about a second ; then
with a soar it flew on to the beer-pump
damsel’s head, where it spat out blue
sparks, which turned into eggs and
hatched out millions of centipedes.
Each centipede had a vaccination mark on
its left front leg. As I know “Sarto” is interested
in these matters, I’ve bought a trap and will send
the bird along as soon as I’ve caught it. Only let
me have it back, as I want it to show to Bill Jones.
“Jimmie Pannikin”: Please let me butt
into this cackle about the busbman’s literary appe-
tite. I am on “Gouger’s” side when he asserts that
it is utter rubbish to call the bushman “a literary
degenerate.” Many of the bushman’s creaking and
croaking critics suffer from fatty degeneration of
the intellect. These critics creak because their mental
machinery wants oiling with the lubricant of com-
mon-sense. They croak because, like frogs, they live
in the swamps of swill and swipes. Sane and sober
men do not make such absolutely untenable charges.
It was an Outback bushman whom I first heard use
the ruthlessly right phrase: “The piffle of Charlie
Garbage.” It ought to be sold in sealed tins, for
obvious reasons. I have often said and written
that the majority of even the old-age pensioners
camped on the banks of the Darling prefer good
reading matter and baccy to firewater and chain-
lightning as gifts. The number of outbackers who
read the “Red Page” regularly and digestively aston-
ished me. I’d like to shake “Gouger” by the hand.
Some of the other writers in this controversy I would
cheerfully shake by the neck.
* * * *
“Pick”: If “Tarago” (B. 22/1/ i 4) under-
stands what happens when a cyclist is following a
pacemaker, he should also know why a gale invari-
ablj' follows a bush fire instead of setting in towards
it from all points of the compass. Until the flare
has assumed considerable proportions, sufficient local
heat to cause an inset of colder air is not created ;
but, meantime, driven onward by any" • prevailing
breeze, or led by the upward slope of the country,
the fire leaps forward, driving the atmosphere with
it, and thus causing an ever-increasing suction from
behind. Moreover, any inset of colder air would
tumble in behind, inasmuch as ahead of the disturb-
ance things are only beginning to warm up, while
rearward the blazing debris cooks the surrounding
atmosphere to a cinder. In connection with bush
fires, there is one thing, however, that puzzles me.
How do insects and small bush creatures learn of
the coming trouble? I have seen droves of them
scrambling away from a coming fire, when, to me,
the only indication of its approach was a smoke
rising over the range.
“5.11. G.”: Mudgee’s troubles with wom-
bats (B. 4/12/’l3) are not over yet. When the
lOs.-a-head bonus was offered, 1500 wombat corpses
were presented. The Pastures Protection Board
emptied its cashbox and still owed £5lO. It tried
to compromise at 6s. a head, but the offer was treated
with shouts of derision, and the Board had to take
up another hole in its belt. The rabbit-inspector
was sacked, stock-inspectors’ wages were reduced by
£3O a year and clerks’ by £25, and the directors
themselves had their own fees cut down by one-half ;
at the same time, rates on stock were jumped up
from 2s. Id. per 100 sheep to 3s. 6d. and from lid.
to 3d. a head for larger stock. But The Bulletin
was out when it suggested that in the event of a
plague of tigers the Board would scalp anyone who
suggested a bonus of id. per head ; for when it had
finished pruning everyone’s salary, it decided to give
a £l-a-head bonus for dingoes, because they were
getting very plentiful. Some people are whales for
trouble.
“Gordon G.”: The “true adventures” of
one Matthew Tracey, of the Amurrikan Fleet, as pub-
lished in H’Yark:—
On my arrival I was presented by Cardinal Moran
to one of the grandest men in Australia, Timothy
McGrath, of Ballarat, who has grown up with the
country, and raised millions of sheep, and is worth
a million dollars. Mr. McGrath has nary a son to
leave his acres of sheep ranch at Ballarat to, and he
is very anxious that I should marry his only daughter,
and become heir to his millions. I said I would have
to finish my period of service with Uncle Sam, and
that then I would go back to the sheep ranch at
Ballarat and claim my lovely bride.
The story is profusely illustrated with pictures show-
ing Timothy, his town house, his ranch and his
emus and kangaroos. Tracey is expected here shortly
to claim all these things—unless, of course, his
own country’s police need him.
“Cleveland”: How’s this for the casual
stakes? I was loafing in a deck-chair on board of
an East-bound ship which was lying. in Townsville
(N.Q.) harbor, when a man hove in sight who had
obviously looked on the wine when it was brimming.
Presently he hailed one of the wharfhands: “Shay,
d’remember two coves I was with —no, I mean was
with me?” The lumper looked stonily at the man
of beer, who proceeded: “The little fat bloke (hie)
is the bloke I mean,” he said. “Wot about him,
anyhow?” asked the other. The unstable one col-
lected his ideas. “He’s in the flaming water; fell
over the blitherin’ wharf, and er shark’ll get ’im,
sure. Gotta bloke lars’ week, ’n’ Bill’l make two,
an’ then there’ll be another one soon. Always goes
in threes,” he concluded prophetically. The toiler
then asked where the other pal was. “ ’E’s sittin’
on the wharf watchin’ Bill duckin’ round er pile,”
said the prophet. “Rotten things, piles; all over
barnacles an’ copper. Bill’l soon go now. Wouldn’t
be s’prised if er shark ’ad ’im before I get back.”
He turned and stumbled cursefully up the jetty. Five
minutes he was back again, hurrying excitedly.
“Wot’d I tell you erbout three ’aving to go?” he
yelled triumphantly. “Jim’s over the side now.
’E was leanin’ over to lissen to wot Bill was bawlin’
erbout, an’ fell in ’imself. ’E makes the three
orlright. Only for that cove lars’ week goin’ over,
Bill an’ Jim’d be ’ere now.” I waited to see if
the wharf operator would become interested, but he
didn’t; so I hurriedly investigated. It was even as
the little boozer had stated, Bill and Jim were
hanging on to a stringer, hollering alternately for
pledge-cards and a rope.
“Billabong”: A Victorian judge has given
a decision on a question which affects the cocky all
over Australia. Two Vic. farmers lived on opposite
sides of a deep creek. One drained cows and the
other grew corn. A cow, swimming across the creek,
got into the crop, and etc. The corngrower alleged
trespass, and sued for damages. Defendant raised
the point that the creek frontage was not fenced, and
that damages could only be claimed for trespass on
enclosed land. The plaintiff then took a hand and
argued that a creek was a fence according to the
law made and provided, and a County Court Judge
upheld the contention. It appears that the Eng-
lish Fencing Acts, from which the Victorian Acts are
copied, define a fence to include a ditch, stream or
watercourse. The only chance defendant has of getting
even is to lie in wait to catch the crops crossing the
creek to devour the cows. Then the agriculturist
will wish he had never been born.
“S.T.S.”: I should like to think that
“Camp” really found a corpse in a buggy, as he
describes in B. l/l/’lt, and tipped it out, taking its
place between the two live occupants—and so on.
But digging up bodies for dissection purposes sounds
much more like England 70 years back than any
“bush township” within “Camp’s” recollection. Any-
way, it was one of the pet stories of Sketchley (real
name Rose), author of the immensely popular “Mrs.
Brown.” He was in Australia in the early ’Bo’s, and
it was then I heard the yarn. He finished it very
neatly, too. The grave-robbers drove on, with the
supposed corpse squeezed between them, till finally
a dreadful suspicion became a certainty. “ ‘Bill!’
‘What is it?’ ‘Bill, he’s —warm!’ ‘Warm,’ I said,
in a hollow voice; ‘you'd be warm if you’d been in
Hell as long as I have!’ Then they gave a yell and
tumbled out on either side and bolted, and I was
left with a very nice horse and trap for my trouble.”
“Wandi”: A conundrum often propounded
in camp and hut is why kangaroos and wallabies do
not inter-breed, when the only generic distinction
between them is that the nostril interspace is naked
in the kangaroo and hairy in the wallaby. The
bushman, as a rule, can tell one from the other at
a glance without looking to see if it has hair on
its nose. This is largely due to his knowledge of
their haunts. Asked to explain the difference, h 4
will usually refer to the relative sizes of the animals,
and a miscroscopic distinction in the shape of the
ears. But place a big wallaby in open country, and
a small kangaroo in a scrub, and without some dis-
tinctive mark to guide him, the bushman will be
hopelessly mixed. Size, of course, is no criterion;
but taking the common species, a full-grown wallaby
is only the size of a half-grown kangaroo. Some of
the jerboaroos are just as difficult to distinguish in
the bush from some of the bandicoots. Generally
speaking, the jerboaroos have short, rounded ears,
short noses and white bellies ; whereas the bandicoot
has long ears and an elongated snout. The smallest
marsupial that hops is the jerboa pouched mouse,
which was a body length of about three inches and a
five-inch tail, with a dark brush. Between this mite and
the grey boomer there are more living grades and
variations than there are inches between their
respective sizes.
LIQUID MEASURE.
“Say, Boss, how far am I from Boolabillalong?”
“Oh, about two pubs, I think!”
“Tarago”: “Gip” (B. 8/l/’l4) asks:
“Are foxes snake exterminators?” I can’t say
whether Reynard deals with the enemy of man first-
hand ; but I can offer circumstantial evidence that
he dines off it. I have happened on a number of
his habitations with the front garden strewn with
the remains of defunct reptiles. The imported gent.
may make the kill, but I doubt it. For the matter
of that, very few of the native or imported inhabi-
tants of the bush kill snakes either for recreation
or for other purposes, if you except the common tike.
As for “snakes growing beautifully less where foxes
are thick,” I dunno; but if it came to a question
of extermination, my lucre would go on the snake.
He is more numerous, and holds the punch that outs,
whereas Reynard must miss sometimes.

Martell’s Brandy appeals forcibly
to men of good taste. Its fine
aromatic bouquet, full fruity flavor
and distinctive body are gained
from the juice of the rich, luscious
Charente Grapes from which it is
made with such care and skill.
Martell’s Brandy is always of uniform excel-
lence, and its richness in the higher ethers
causes it to be highly recommended by
physicians as a stimulant to the weak, fatigued,
aged and convalescent. It quickly soothes the
nerves, stimulates the heart, invigorates mind
and body, and ensures quiet health-restoring
sleep.
Always have Martell’s in the home, where
the Blue and Silver Label will be as good
as a Mascot.
Martell’s-the Brandy
of Unbeaten Quality.

“WHERE THE BEST ENGINES ARE SOLD
By Proxy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SOO-NAN had lost more than he could
afford, and the last shreds of his temper
and self-control were following his van-
ished taels. So, when a strange, dirty, long-
taloned hand shot out and took to itself Soo-
nan’s only winning stake and gains, the
despoiled owner went the Chinese equivalent
for Baresark.
He followed up a whistling Cantonese
curse with a carved stool, a broken-handled
knife, the heavy brass dice-box, and sundries.
The 21b. of dice-box took the unknown in the
small of the back and he collapsed, arms and
pigtail outspread, with his head nuzzling into
the feet of the great carven Joss of Chance.
He was quite dead when they turned him
over. An enlarged spleen and a flying lump
of metal will “do for” most ’rickshaw coolies.
The indescribable, meaningless chatter that
every low-class coolie raises on every possible
occasion died down as Soo-nan was hustled
into the street. A barefooted policeman, in
a little, conical, plaited straw helmet,
prodded him through Canton’s four-foot-wide
streets to the Yamen.
For the consideration of two dollars from
the prisoner—and the possibilities of a big
“squeeze” from the old man—the straw-
helmeted policeman sauntered to the shop of
Soo-wat, a rattan worker on the Bund, and
the father of Soo-nan.
Here, in many words, he told of the fate
of Soo-nan, and enlarged on the chance of
him being one of the interested parties in the
next execution.
Soo-wat thought regretfully of the many
pleasant Sundays he had spent with his son
by the river, watching the public executions
in the old Tan Tock square. How they had
shouted as the heads rolled and jumped!
How they had laughed when the heavy, two-
handed sword made a misshit, and clove a
skull instead of taking the countenance off
clean at the neck.
And it was entertaining and amusing to
note how the expression changed on each
lined face as the swinging sword came nearer
and nearer! But to see his own son one of
that kneeling, doomed line—he must buy a
substitute quickly.
Old Soo-wat sighed as he drew the savings
of ten years from their hiding-place in the
well under the courtyard, and hurried to the
mandarin at the Yamen.
That was a big “squeeze.”
He told the tearful Soon-nan the news
through the grimy bars, and hobbled on his
way. From the reeking, stinking prison it is
but a step to the Kow Chee Hock —the guild
whose members sell themselves for punish-
ment or death.
Soo-wat saw Ah Young. To be exact, he
saw as much of the original Ah Young as
was publishable.
Ah Young had crawled in from the lower
provinces to die in Canton City: but he
would not take less than 200 taels for dying
in four days at the end of a two-handed
sword.
Soo-wat, with tears in his voice, pointed
out that 200 taels was robbery when asked
by a leper that would most probably drop
to pieces in a month. He begged him to
consider the easy, quick finish in one light-
ning stroke: he implored him to think of the
luxury to be bought with —say, 70 taels.
They compromised on 150, paid into Ah
Young’s half a hand, in the presence of
many witnesses.
Ah Young lived at the rate of a thousand
a year—for three days. He bought himself
sham-su, and was gloriously drunk for 12
hours; he bought opium, pork—and more
sham-su.
Never did Chinaman have such a heaven
on earth.
* * * *
Three days in the Yamen had not im-
proved Soo-nan. His almond eyes were red
and sunken. The prison slime marked his
yellow cheeks. The cold, chill dawn of the
fourth day found him yammering at the
bars.
His proxy was due.
An hour passed, another dragged.
He screamed and grovelled in the filth on
the floor as he saw the hopeless look on his
father’s face when the old man approached.
Soo-wat yelled the news at him above the
din. Ah Young had been knifed in an opium
den overnight!
Cocos.
Oimai” : The capture of the whole gang
of Papuans who murdered and probably ate
prospector Warner a few months ago con-
stitutes a record for these affairs in Papua.
The whole job of going and coming between
Samarai and the scene of the murder occu-
pied only two months. The country is ter-
ribly wild and mountainous, and to capture
one lot the R.M. and his police had to ci’oss
the backbone of the island. Considering the
people had never seen “the Government”
before and that there were no “friendlies”
to aid, it was a fine feat. But, then, the
R.M. in question was not a junior clerk from
Melbourne.
“Jay”: The more I see of N. S. Wales Law
the less I like the animal. It is a fool and a
lingering ass at that. Regarded as a dilatory
and impracticable neddy it is the limit. It
has no regard for time. It never heard of
time, or eternity either. A case is impend-
ing, and the parties have to attend the court
and hang round for, perhaps, several days
before their turn is reached. That is bad
enough when there is something to be argued.
But in one case in which I was involved a
settlement had been arrived at, and two
days running I had to travel 30 miles and
waste the best part of a day, to get the
wretched thing scraped off the list. I would
get up and ask that the thing be struck
out, and the other bloke would say he con-
sented, and then the Judge would explain
that we were speaking out of our turn. We
nearly got committed for contempt or dis-
temper or something. Now imagine wasting
the time of a Judge over such a trifle, to say
nothing of my time. The Judge is paid
£l5OO per annum, and 30s. per day exes to
do that sort of work. Why could we not
have walked into the office of the Registrar,
and fixed the thing up in five minutes?
“Harrison O.”: I prophesy that something
sudden will one of these nights happen to
the policeman who, out of deference to
pious clamor, has lately been told off for
searchlight duty in the Fitzroy (Melb.)
Gardens. This forerunner of destiny wan-
ders around, armed with a lantern, seeking
whom he may ascertain. On the soft lawns
even the megatherium-like feet of the Law
cannot be heard, and their owner stirs up
bushes and flashes his lantern suddenly on
to the poet and his poetess, scrutinising them
at length, until satisfied that they are in no
was infringing the Statute of Limitations,
the Hackney Carriages Act, or any other old
regulation. About the only “unwritten
law” recognised by the Australian is the
right of a free-born citizen to slay the quiet-
footed, slow and sudden stranger who looks
round bushes in the parks. In fact, there is
a sort of impression abroad that unless the
slayer boasts of the deed in a pub or a
crowded railway carriage the police will not
race themselves to death in their efforts to
bring him before the Court of Petty Sessions.
But a detective looks like anybody else in a
night surprise, and poets are a hasty crowd
who shoot without consideration. So I don’t
want to be that officer.
From Robert Brothers, war correspondent:
This is about a battle of big hats, and the foolish-
ness of Sydney tram seats, which are placed back to
back without making provision for big hats. When
we sat down the big hat in which I am interested
accidentally scraped against the big hat of the lady
who sat in the seat exactly behind her. The lady in
the back seat was a lady, so she did not turn; but,
being much annoyed, and not intending that her hat
should be scraped by any other big hat in creation,
she gave her head a jerk so as to catch the wearer
of the other big hat on the neck. Now, when the
wearer of a big hat comes into conflict with the
wearer of another big hat, she does not need to turn
to know that the gage of war has been thrown
nothine T w t’L™ u” 'y hl< ; h tfw interestcd sf lcl
notning:, out 1 knew by the look that came into her
eyes that she had accepted the challenge, and in-
stantly there began such a scraping of hats that you
could, hear it some seats away when the tram was
not moving. But no one knew what an earnest con-
teS r t hat , s w f s b . ei f£ waged.
belone-ed 8 tn 6 ™l y . lnte | ested - Neither of the hats
neionged to me, but I have a pecuniary interest in
one of them. The idea on both sides was to get at
the back of the neck, and, failing that, to do as much
damage as possible to the garnishing of the glorified
lids. No regular rules were followed, except that
both contestants refrained from looking round. Apart
trom a hard look in each pair of eyes, each remained
pleasantly ladylike. The lady at the back wore a
lacy halo with several big roses in it. My lady wore
a black tulley affair with little dog roses round the
brim. It was surprising how one read the intention
of the other, and avoided each jab. Like the birds in
a cockfight, each hat strove to get on top and lacer-
ate the plumage of the other. Now and again a rip
would sound above the creaking of the “founda-
tions,’’ and one knew that a deadly slash had been
driven home. I waited in dread for either to turn
and frigidly begin a warfare of words, but neither
did so. For five streets the wrecking of the big
hats went on. I was beginning to get frightened at
the damage that was being done, till at length the
big hat in the other compartment rose and alighted
with a damaged look about it, and went off without a
glance at what was under the other hat. We rode

great applause when Britain repudiates the
congestion policy. The Cold Country, small
as it is, is always manufacturing new har-
bors. A little while ago it opened Imming-
<<Tr , , ~ , . . t,
h V b • Bnsland s latest Port
as the big approving headline ran in the
Telegraph. The paper followed up with
statistics about the size and capacity of
Immingham, and declared it to be a mighty
good thing and an evidence of the commer-
cial brains existing “at Home.” In fact new
outlets are a good thing everywhere except
here.
The Labor proposal to flood the N.S.W.
Legislative Council, with the object of pre-
sently obliterating it, recalls a former at-
tempt to swamp it in order to pass the
Robertson Land Bill. John Robertson had
resigned his seat for the Upper Hunter, and
had gone into the Council to pilot the Bill
through. The Opposition was, however, too
strong, so he decided on getting in another
batch of supporters. The Council had been
appointed on May 13, 1856, for five years. On
May 10, 1861 —three days before the Council
was doomed to expire—Cowper appointed
21 new members, the only notable man in the
list being W. B. Dailey. The President,
W. W. Burton, took the Chair as usual, but
immediately rose and announced that he had
resigned the Chair and his seat in the House.
Captain “Bobbv” Towns got on his legs and
exclaimed “Follow your leader, boys,” and
the Opposition walked out in a body, leaving
John Robertson and his 16 supporters help-
less ; and two days later the Council’s little
life ran out. The next Council was appointed
on June 24, 1861, and members were then for
the first time sent in for the term of their
natural lives.
Hartley Williams, retired Judge of the
Victorian Supreme Court, receives four sovs.
a day from his grateful country—and spends
the money in England. The departure of the
ex-Judge was partly accounted for by his
second marriage. The lady in that case
was an English connection, and her home-
sickness led her to urge a flitting when the
time seemed ripe. The Williams dwelling
at Malvern was a decent place, and calcu-
lated to make a placid soul quite satisfied
with Australia. After the pensioner’s re-
moval the property passed into the hands
of Stratford Strettle, a well-known Mel-
bourne stock and station agent, since de-
ceased. Later, it was bought by widow
Lawrence, relict of a Williamstown pilot
whose ship came home with a goodly cash
cargo. Between times Melba leased the
establishment for a term. While these some-
what lengthy transactions were taking olace,
every blessed day four sovs. of good Aus-
tralian money were going to a never-very-
important person, engaged in passing the
time on the other side of the globe.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The S. M. Herald, referring to the offer
of the Hoskins firm to sell the Lithgow iron-
works to the N.S.W. Government, says it is
the first effect of syndicalism in Australia.
Presumably the Broken Hill Prop.’s modern
works at Newcastle, now rapidly approach-
ing completion, are the second effect.
GRANNY IS ALARMED.
Our statesmen have, however, always recognised
the possibility of these trusts obtaining a foothold
in Australia, and the -legislation passed by both the
Commonwealth and the States has been directed to
meet this danger if, and when, it arrives. When the
Referendum proposals were placed before the country
we repeatedly expressed the view that the powers in
this regard were ample to deal with any real attack
on the interests of the community.—S. M. Herald.
S.M.H. : “Here, my dear, the time is now
ripe.”
Australia: “What! Fight it with that,
thing?”
A Government like that of Westralia
should refuse subsidies to public bodies
which fail to carry out the settled policy of
the country. Perth City Council is a case
in view. Recently, a caretaker being wanted
for the municipal baths, the council adver-
tised for a “married couple without encum-
brance,” and all the while the State rang
with an outcry about its want of population.
It is time some politician proposed a law
under which the person who calls a child
an “encumbrance” shall get three months
for certain. And if the person is connected
with any church he should get six months.
There were two things that the Saviour
didn't say: (1) “Suffer little encumbrances
to come unto Me”; (2) “Thou hast hid
these things from the wise and prudent,
and revealed them unto encumbrances.”
The Victorian Government lias announced
that it will offer another sixpence a day to
its police force from July 1. It was a matter
of raising the honorarium or reducing the
physical standard; but the latter has been
reduced so often, and the former raised so
seldom, that Watt’s crowd thought it had
better give the cash and get brawn, even if,
on the pay offered, it is utterly hopeless to
expect brain.
Sydney D.T. (ominous initials those!)
drew itself up to its full height in its occa-
sionally financial column, on 11/2/T4, wiped
the froth off its moustache, and gave an ex-

THE BIG INTRUDER: "Ahem! After you,
old chap!”
hibition of gentlemanly fury, marred only by
a few hiccups. To put the matter briefly, the
Investors’ Review had accused Australasia
of being loan-drunk, and the B.T. (again
those shaky initials!) took the quarrel on it-
self, it being a dear old friend of ’Stralia and
jealous of its reputation as a moderate
drinker. When the worst of its rage had
been worked off it started triumphantly to
prove that ’Stralia was perfectly sober by
strewing an array of figures on the bar
counter. Why, in four years, while ’Stralia
was drinking a mere £30,000,000, Canada had
swallowed £169,000,000, Argentina had reeled
out with £72,000,000 in its bottle, and Brazil
was dozing comfortably in a corner, after
having disposed of £60,000,000. “Shurely,”
gulped the D.T., tipping its hat over its
bloodshot eyes and tightly gripping the edge
of Ae counter —“shurely they are far more
glarin’ exshamplsh!” There is the crystal-
lised logic of the drunk. Because Smith and
Brown are drunker’n / am, therefore I am
perfectly sober!
According to a witness before
the Inter-State Commission last
week, the Holman Government,
which is kept in power by. the
votes of N.S.W. Laborites and
Labor sympathisers, lately gave
a contract for strawboard to. a
Japanese firm, the sole consid-
eration apparently being the
price. Perhaps Holman ruled
out the question of patriotism
on account of the competing
Australian paper mill being
located in Victoria. To such a
confirmed parish pumner the 1
Victorian is as much a foreigner
as the Jap. But Labor in
N.S.W. should remember it.
smainst Holman; in fact, it is
morally bound to remember it.
Loyalty to the Labor Cause (if
not to. Australia) should not
be merely a matter of wages
and working conditions and
irritating strikes. A strike
against Holman would be a sort of inspira-
tion just now.
From the uttermost north of Australia: —
In a Melbourne Age which has drifted up this far
I read:—
“We, in Australia, completely surrounded by sea,
with a barren and inhospitable coast, and several
weeks’ sail from' any potential enemy . .”
The Age either doesn’t know geography or has weird
ideas of what constitutes a “potential enemy.’’ Just
seven days’ journey for a fighting ship from this
writer’s address, which is in Australia, is Japan, with
a large modern navy and an over-populous country.
These two factors are generally accepted- as the things
chiefly necessary to turn a nation into the “potential
enemy” of a large empty country with a congenial
climate and an inadequate defence. If the Age were
to shift its printery from the comparative safety of
Melbourne to (say) the north of Queensland, it would
discover that the “several weeks” had boiled down to
a few days, and that, so far as the North is con-
cerned, the “barren and inhospitable coast” only
exists in infrequent patches. The invader will not be
foolish enough to steam all the way to Smellbourne
and its dangerous harbor to do his invading, when,
by dropping in on the far handier North, he can be
ashore and have the billy boiled before we can call
round to ask Whaffor ? We may be able to turn
him out; and, again, we may not. But it does seem
easier ,to have the argument with the intruder at
. the garden-gate instead of trying to fire him out of
the parlor.

The struggle to move the wheat that is
waiting for export, to the one port in N.S.W.
which is allowed to deal with the business,
grows really strenuous. At February 7,.
1911, there were 2;949,000 bags clamoring
for trucks at N.S.W. country railway sta-
tions. In 1912 (same date) there were
3.488-000 bags. In 1913 the arrears consisted
of 3.034,000 bags. Now in 1914 they amount
to 5,190,000 bags. At 13 different country
stations more than 100,000 bags are bogged
or stranded, while over 251.000 bags have
been on one day blotting out the sun on the
wharf at Darling Harbor, Sydney.
Land is becoming so scarce in artificially
congested Sydney that greedy eyes are now
faxed on cemetery re-
serves. The Ryde muni-
cipality is approaching
the Minister for Lands
and begging him to revoke
the dedication of 160
acres of land that have
been awaiting the first
North Shore corpse and
gravedigger ■ for 12 long
years. Also, owing
doubtless to the high
price of meat, reverent,
undertakerish sportsmen
have lately been shooting
rabbits in the Necropolis.
Sydney is growing very
crowded, and if some of
the closed ports are not
opened and the popula-
tion pressure thereby lessened, the Sydney
dead of to-morrow may have to be buried in
trees.
Henry Hawker, the Australian flying man,
has offered some remarks about this coun-
try’s aerial defence fleet which should make
the Cook Government sit up and think. By
reason of the importing craze the sky-ships
were ordered in England, and it was 12
months before they arrived. Then because-
the somnolent Department didn’t quite know
what to do with them, and hadn’t yet im-
ported men to manage them—being a somno-
lent importing Department it didn’t dream
of giving local men a show and letting them
train other local men—the goods have fes-
tered in retirement for another 12 months.
And as a greatly improved model comes out
about twice a year the contraptions are
already antiquated. The country might have
been busy learning how to build and manage
air-craft.' Thanks to the importing disease
it has only been looking at the outsides of a
lot of ancient packing-cases.
SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY.
MISTRESS: "Of course, I don't wish to put
any obstacles 'in the way of your getting
married, but I wish it were possible to
postpone it until I get another maid."
MARY ANN: “Well, mum, I ' ardly think I
know ’im well enough to arsk ’im to put
it off."
SACRILEGE.
In addition to the State brickworks, lime-works,
quarries, pipe factory, clothing factory, joinery, tal-
low works and the bakery, the Ministerial head of
the Department of Labor and Industry has deter-
mined to have a State dairy.— News item.
EXCITED COW COCKY: "There y'are! There’s
nothing sacred to the Labor party.”
THE O THER: “ 'Ave they busted up the mar-
riage lie?”
EXCITED ONE: “Worse than that. They're
nationalising Cows!"
By the Religious Editor: —
“The news of the appointment of the Hon. Munro-
Ferguson, as Governor-General of Australia in succes-
sion to Lord Denman, lias given universal satisfac-
tion.” So clamors one of the feverish little papers
that do their best to be a sort of Court Journal to
the suburbs. And the obscure Mo-Ferg knows so
little about the country whose bazaars he is to open
that the cable reports him as “devouring all the
books upon Australia that he can get hold of.” That
and some letters from ex-Governor Carmichael, of
Victoria, seem to be his equipment. Yet the panting
little rag is dead sure that his appointment has “given
universal satisfaction” to the people he doesn’t know,
and who certainly don’t know him. Hell is draped
with this sort of cow's innards.
An ex-Han sard man
writes: —
Dan O’Connor was invariably a
“fat turn.” A hundred words of
his grandiloquent, sesquipedalian
phraseology, when judiciously con-
densed to essentials, would repre-
sent about five lines. One night
he made a long speech on the
land question. It was my lot to
start with him on a 20min.
“turn” ; but the Chief, well know-
ing what a rambling, repetitious
mass of verbiage it would be,
directed that I should take the
whole of it. I had over four
hours of Demos-
thenes. When the
report was issued
Dan leaped into the
Chief’s room in a
state of coat-tail
and belltopper and
fur}', and demanded
to know why his
speech had been so
much curtailed.
“Here you are, look
at this. Sir Hen-
ery made a speech
which occupied ex-
actly an hour, and
it filled so many
pages. My speech
lasted over four
hours, and I have
fewer pages.” The
explanation was
simple and unsatis-
factory. Dan had
obliged by sending
his “notes” for the
verification of quo-
tations. The “notes”
disclosed a masterly
speech, all pith and
point, and the
handwriting was
that of W. B. Dai-
ley. It would have
lasted half an hour.
That was the speech
we printed. Of
Daniel’s wander-
ings and sham-
blings and mean-
derings and rav-
ines and vast polvslyllabic perambulations we took
no notice at all. We told him this, and he was as
wild as an intoxicated Rechabite.
J B. Holme, who was appointed to the
N.S.W. Labor and Industry Department by
the McGowen Ministry, has become a lull-
blown Under-Secretary. Minister LsteJl,
his chief, says that he has. been singuari'
successful in grappling with industrial stril .
end that he has a “grip” on such matters.
With the meat strike and all the otbei
wrangles Holme has plenty of room for his
grapple, and his grip won’t become blue-
mouldy for want of use. .
THE HINDU.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There were two views of the Indian population in
Fiji. The Indians were easily governed and kept in
subjection. They were also a fecund race. The stop-
page of the supply of labor would be a heavy blow.
On the other hand, the Indian had in many places
ousted the small trader. Merchants regarded the
outlook with apprehension.— J. M. Iledstrom, Legis-
lative Councillor and trader from, Fiji, in S. M.
Herald (12/2/’l4).
Oh, let us have our good Hindu,
Our bland and mild Hindu,
Who doesn’t want to live like you,
Who never swanks like you,
A gross and meat-fed crew ;
Yes, let us keep our nice Hindu,
Our humble fellow-subject, who
Will labor all the long day through
For rice and stew—
Hooroo !
Oh, spare our diligent Hindu,
Our thrifty, strong Hindu, ,
Who would not go on strike like you,
Who dares not strike like you,
A rank, rebellious crew ;
Yes, grant us yet our cheap Hindu,
So gentle and so fecund, who
Will swiftly multiply by two
In inky hue —
Goo-goo !
Oh, save us from the gross Hindu,
The oily, fat Hindu,
Who undercuts us worse than you,
Destroys us worse than you,
A free and careless crew.
Grant rescue from the sleek Hindu,
Who sets up shop, and sticks like glue,
Till we go bung with faces blue,
Are up the flue —•

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The conclusion of Sydney’s ninth round
of First-Grade Cricket was highly interesting. On
the previous Saturday rain had driven most of the
teams from the fields after less than an hour of
batting. Of course, in such circumstances, which
made it necessary fpr both sides to get through
then first innings on the last day of the round
drawn j games were bound to be numerous. But
Gordon s chances of making a draw with University
looked hue The Students had got loose on the
Gordon bowling, and gathered up 355 for four
wickets before the rain drove the teams from the
held. On Saturday last, instead of declaring right
away, as everybody expected, Uni. went on and
accumidated 407 for seven wickets. Then realising
that it had to get Gordon out to win, it hurriedly
closed and went out to rush Gordon through. But
jc Students had forgotten Gordon’s strong man
Macartney. And how did he rage! The heathen was
milk and water compared to him, and the Wowser
rnnl a H h ° lamb. He stood like solid
f l} dlnB \ afternoon, and smote and
bashed and battered and biffed till 227 appeared
te hl t ~m- For a tlme h is disheartened
colleagues faded away, man by man, but at last
Jordan came and made a stubborn stand, and toge-
ther they broke the heart and hope of University,
mu / th f, dusk was dosing in Macartney put his
leg before the wicket. S. Trumper took his place, and
he and Jordan played it out till the light went and
tile stumps were drawn, with eight wickets down for
. *’• n hat had looked like sure defeat was turned
into a drawn game. Middle Harbor had a similar
experience Sydney had collected 235 for six wickets
and closed. Middle Harbor had no earthly hope ex-
cept by keeping the sticks up till time ran out. This
* UCCC< '! I<,(I in doing, thanks to Randell (41), Lowe
(3o) and Anderson (17). But it was a close shave
—nine wickets had gone for V miserable 117 when
gloom ended the struggle. Paddington also played
clo p k - ° n the first day it had felled
Glebe wickets for 165 runs. On Saturday
Olobe lifted the score to 281, when it closed with
nine wickets down. Paddington got busy and wal-
loped with such energy that when the light vanished
only eight, wickets had fallen for 215, and Glebe
had missed its win. Waverley, which had 228 to its
credit, failed to put North Sydney through the mill,
the stubborn hillmen losing only four wickets at
knock-off time for 121. Balmain was unlucky. It
hit 196 off the Western Suburbs bowling, but the
Suburbs team responded with 213 for the loss of
only three wickets, Taylor, the not-out man, smit-
ing 101. So Balmain was down and but by 17 runs
on the first innnings. Redfern was a sad example of
what happens when you under-rate your antagonist.
Captain Goddard, having seen 196 smitten off Cen-
tral Cumberland for five wickets, closed; but he
struck quite unexpected scoring on the part of the
Parramatta rank and file. Best (40), Thomas (44),
Pye n.o. (41) and others lifted 201 on to the
board for the loss of five wickets, and so defeated
Goddard and his merry men by five runs.
Individually, Macartney, of course, was easily the best
with 227 off the University bowlers. Incidentally, it
might be mentioned that the Gordon warrior occupied
only 190 min. compiling that mammoth score. Next
to him came old Syd Gregory with 128 (n. 0.) for
Waverley; then the 102 of Emery for Redfern, who
also humped his timber at the end of the innings.
J. S. Taylor made 101 for Western Suburbs, and
practically won the match against Balmain. This
concluded the list of centuries. V. C. Robins, of
Glebe, carried his bat for 85 ; Lamrock, of Univer-
sity, made 77 ; Fusedale, of Sydney, carried his bat
for 59 ; Coffey, of Sydney, also made 55 : Moore, of
North Sydney, hit 54 ; and Dwyer, of Paddington,
was still on deck at the end of the innings for 51.
Among the bowlers the best was P. W. Dive, of West
ern Suburbs, who smashed six Balmain wickets fo,
39 runs. S. C. Freeman, of Glebe, who took five
Paddington wickets for 69 ; Shortland, of Gordon,
who got five University sticks for 145 ; and Best, of
Central Cumberland (otherwise Parramatta), who got
four Redfern wickets for 48; Hopkins, the bee-
farmer, took four Waverley wickets for North Sydney
at a cost of 51 runs; and Barbour, of University,
upset four Gordon wickets for 66. Altogether, it was
an exciting afternoon.

don’t see what good can come from another lavish
expenditure. If any money is to be spent it is in
the interests of cricket that it should be expended
on bringing from the Old Country a thoroughly
good professional. More can be learned from one
professional in one month than could be learned
from 12 annual consecutive visits from the Aus-
tralians. Never think for one moment this Aus-
tralian tour is a philanthropic one. It is a money-
making scheme got up by Mr. Benjamin, and the
promoter has doubtless done well as the result of
his enterprise. . . .Winnipeg got the Australians
cheaper than any other city, paying $l2OO for three
games. It was a terrific price, and money thrown
away. But for the tour now planned $lOOO per
match is asked.” The Australian Board of Con-
trol should hit this brand of boodle-cricket with an
axe, and hit it so hard that only one blow will be
necessary.

The Australian XI in Maoriland struck a
snag at Wellington last week, when a local bowler
named Southall destroyed five wickets for 34 runs,
and a wight named Saunders created a painful im-
pression by getting away with three for 40. The
mighty Trumper was caught and bowled by Saunders
for a duck, and Southall clean bowled Armstrong for
the same round sign of zero. The whole side van-
ished for 124. However, Armstrong had his revenge
when the Maorilanders went to the sticks. He took
four of their wickets for two runs. Five wickets
fell for 32.

The Sheffield Shield match at Adelaide
between South Australia and Victoria saw some
sensational bowling by Crawford and Mayne for the
Croweaters. The Victorians had disposed of the
South Australians for 274, but by nightfall they had
lost two wickets for 28. On Saturday Crawford and
Mayne broke loose and the former took five wickets
for 48 and Mayne three for six. Three Victorians
failed to score, and Baring’s 71 was the top figure.
Carroll (35), Fitzpatrick (40), and Ryder (n.o. 36)
were the other principal scorers, but the side van-
ished for 213. With a lead of 61 the South Aus-
tralians started on the second round, and although
there was no sensational scoring, it was so good all
round that they rattled up 349. Victoria, requiring
411 to win, started on a hopeless looking: task, and
bv nightfall had accumulated 96 for the loss of two
wickets. On Tuesday the score was lifted to 185 for
six wickets, and the case looked more hopeless than
-ver.
Australia is threatened with another
Yankee baseball raid, according to one “Jim” Brown,
He says it will eventuate in October next and fall
on the “gate” at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Adelaide.

Summer baseball has now entered on the
championship competition, and on Saturday the men
from Leichhardt came up against the men of Wav-
erley and overthrew them by eight runs to three. The
Waverley batting was indifferent compared to that of
Leichhardt, and it was not till the fifth session that
the losers managed to score. Leichhardt started well,
making two at the jump ; but it was in the last ses-
sion it laid Waverley waste by scoring a whole four.

Died at Williamstown tMelb.) last week,
George Coop, whose name was well known to Aus-
tralia in the long ago. Coop made his mark on
several branches of sporting endeavor, and as a
wrestler he worked for some time with Professor
Miller when that big lump of a strong man was
young at the game.

The bone of contention among the amateur
swimmers of Sydney on Saturday was the final for
the President’s Cup. This goblet goes to the swim-
mer who scores the most points in a competition of
four long-distance races: 880 Yards, 1320 Yards, One
Mile, and Three Miles. Saturday saw the Three
Miles battled through. The sun was fierce, but the
breeze was delightful, and the water was tepid in
the fervent heat. Longworth was on scratch and had
to wait 25min. while the distance man battled away.
In March, 1911, in that same Domain bath, he had
established the record by swimming the distance in
lhr. ISmin. 22 2-ssec. He was sure on Saturday that
he had no hope of winning, but he determined to do
his darnedest, and his darnedest was a fine effort. It
proved that, as a long-distance swimmer, he is as
mighty as ever he was. Although he failed to win
the race, and finished third, he broke his own record
by getting through the distance in lhr. 18min. 8 2-ssec.
Colton won the race, and by so doing scored 12
points in the competition. Longworth was second,
with 10 ; and Weilandt third, with nine. So Colton
takes the President’s goblet.

Oscar Dickman picked up the 440 Yards
N.S.W. professional championship at the League of
Swimmers’ meeting at Leichhardt (Sydney) last
week. There were six other starters, but Dick-
man led the way from the beginning, and paddled
home an easy winner in smin. 52sec. Which was
deadly slow. At the same assembly Miss G.
Hooper decorated her costume with the Ladies’ 100
Yards Championship in lmin. 18 2-ssec.
IRONY.
Johnny Summers counted out in a prayerful
attitude in the first round of his return scrap
with Tom McCormick, at Sydney.
The first instalment of the Amateur
Athletic Championships of N.S.W. at Sydney Sports
Ground on Saturday drew a crowd of about three
thousand, composed mostly of ladies and old and
young men with clean-shaven visages. The patriots
prayed and hoped for the downfall of the Yankee
band which had picked up six championships at
Melbourne. But prayers were of no avail against
Yankee fleetness, and the Yankees got away with the
half-dozen events in which they competed. They were
heralded as the “cream” of athletic strength, and
proved to be it. The N.S.W. talent was not even
good buttermilk in comparison. The draw card
was G. L. Parker, of the U.S.A., and he filled his
part by annexing the 100 and 440 Yards champion-
ships. Parker does not strike the eye as what a
champion should be. There is none of the grace of
Apollo Belvedere about him. He is heavy and un-
gainly, and it is gigantic strength which propels him
at such speed. In the 100 Yards his pace at 20yds.
was as fast as when he smashed the tape, and to the
cold eye of the onlooker it seemed that had Bradley
of N.S.W. unwound his sprint in the final a little
earlier history might have told another tale than
the defeat of the Australian by 12in. The 440 Yards
provided a hurricane tussle for half way, but there-
after it was a procession with Parker leading the
way, galloping as though pursued by devils or wild
women. Taking time for it Parker is no great
shakes. A wind strong enough to blow over hurdles
was raging behind the runners, yet the 100 Yards
occupied 10 1-5 sec., and the 440 Yards usurped
51 4-5 sec. These times are far behind both Aus-
tralasian and World records. The finest spectacle
was the Mile Championship, where J. Power (U.S.A.)
defeated A. F. Thorpe and others in 4min. 33 3-ssec.
—lOsecs. behind the worst' figures in the “book.”
Power took the bit in his molars when starter Dick
Coombes pulled the trigger, and with a beautiful action
made for the tape as though the Peace Society were
after him. Thorpe sorely tried to burst his boiler
in the chase, but failed to do so by three yards.
Power’s evenness of movement is something to cheer
about. R. R. Templeton, a veritable india-rubber
ball of Yankee make, also picked up a double—the
120 Yards Hurdles from J. AV. Fraser in 15 4-ssec.
(the only N.S.W. record equalled in the running
events), and the pole vault, wherein he scaled a
miserable 10ft. Still the best N.S.W. effort was
a still more miserable 9ft., shared by C. T. Fergu-
son and R. A. Adams. The other limb of the Yankee
team picked up a championship trifle when the broad-
shouldered E. R. Caughey heaved with his left hand
161 b. of lead over a distance of 43ft.Olin. Local roan
J. O’Reilly, with 39ft. llfin., was the best Aus-
tralian effort. Afterwards Caughey heaved the
object 44ft. Sin.—s4in. over the N.S.W. record.
In the other events, left solely to N.S.w.
athletes, policeman A. W. Pickard had no
difficulty in outing the opposition in the Mile Walk
in 6min. 54sec., and “Jqck” Smith broad-jumped
opponents and won with a commendable 22ft. 3?in.
Thus ended the first feast-day for the American
athletes, and only an earthquake will stay a second
banquet the comjng Saturday. #
Germany is going to make an effort to
sweep the board at the next Olympiad. A commis-
sion has been sent to the United States to study
American methods, and bring back, regardless of
cost, the best traine: that can be discovered. He
is to train the German trainers, who will train the
Olympians. This individual is to be paid partly by
the Kingdom of Prussia arid partly by the Germanic
Empire. German athleticism is to be nationalised.
The country 1 is divided into districts, and each dis-
trict will select its best, and then the best in the
Empire will be selected from the best in the dis-
tricts. It ip a fine, comprehensive scheme.
The sculling championship of Maoriland
is an item that has not been wildly sought after of
late. But it is threatened with resurrection. Wil-
liam Fogwell, a busted N.S.W. championship hope,
migrated and picked up the honor which was lying
on the roadside, a couple of years ago, and has kept
it ever since to the indifference of the Shivery
Isles. Now, however, Paddy Hannan has thrown in
a challenge. If the match is arranged both scullers
will have to cross the Tasman Sea to fulfill the condi-
tion that the Maoriland championship can be raced
for only in Maorjland waters.
The racing at Caulfield last Saturday
knocked the bottom out of the idea that Traquette
and Woorak are 2-year-olds of the highest class.
Brilliant youngsters in the past have proved equal
to winning the Oakleigh Handicap from a field _ of
seasoned sprinters, but Woorak, a warm favorite,
after making all the rqnning up to the last turn,
was not in it with Pppinjay, Nuwara Eliya, Aleconner
and co. Previous tp the Oakleigh Plate race, Tra-
quette, with lOst. lib. up, had made a poor show
in the Federal Stakes. The top weight was going
nearly 3st. to the winner, but the “flying” filly
should at least have put up a fight.
On his Oakleigh Plate performance Popin-
jay has a fair chance to take the Futurity Stakes for
the second time in three tries. But there are others.
Some of the lighter weights must be dangerous in
the Futurity—which is worth £2OOO, and carries no
penalty for the winper—if they are to make any sort
of show in the Newmarket Handicap a week later.
Garnell, for instance. Thusfar, Mr. Baron Brown’s
imported mare has done nothing to speak of, but now
is the time for her to cut a dash if it is in her.
Carnell’s work on the track of late suggests the
possibility of a win next Saturday.
Something of a record! All six gee-gees
which poked their noses first past the winning post at
the V.A.T.C. meeting at Caulfield (Vic.) on Saturday
last were bred in New South Wales. The faith in
the Ma State brute is likely to rise somewhat over
such an happening.
Passed out at Bondi (Sydney) last week,
Charles Stanley, probably the greatest of “old time”
Australian jockeys. It was in 1868 Stanley was at
hip best, and kicked up a tremendous dust by win-
ning two V.R.C. Derbies (the only two Derbies ever
attempted in one State in one year), the St. Leger,
Sydney Cup, A.J.C. Metropolitan and Melbourne Cup.
It was a hurricane performance even for the bad old
days. # »
The mariners of Prince Alfred Yacht Club
were accused of neglecting their womenfolk, not
having had a ladies’ day since December 13; so, to
restore peace in a hundred homes, Saturday’s race
for the Albert Cup was made a social function as well
as a sporting contest. Afternoon tea and cakes were
added to the usual necessaries of life served out by
the club to the hardened seadogs. The Albert Cup
is an inside race, and the utensil itself is the gift
of the well-known mariner, Mr. F. Albert, who
donated it last year. The final owner will be the
yachtsman who wins it three times. Last year it
fell to Messrs. Wadsworth and Fleming in the
Aoma. This year, Rawhiti (scratch), Sayonara,
Culwulla 111., Petrel, Aoma, Ranee, Sunbeam and
Curlew all went after it. Curlew was the distance
boat, with 33min. handicap. It was never headed,
but led from start to finish, and when the Culwulla
111. made its splendid dash the handicap held good
apd brought the Albert Cup to Mr. A. Wilson.
The Sydney Flying Squadron had the light
north-east wind so well-beloved by the open-boat men
for the usual two heats and a final. The feature
of the first bout was the defeat of Chris Webb in
Australian. Sunny Sputh went off with a bound,
and the only boat that could keep pace with it was
N[ona. They raced together to Shark Island, where
Mona went overboard and left Sunny South undis-
puted winner. The breeze freshened nicely as the
second heat started, and Eunice, with three minutes
start, looked a sure thing. But Stewart’s Swastika
went to the front, apd led the way to the Taylor
Bay mark by a few seconds. Then Eunice let fly a
topsail and ballooner and gradually drew level.
Swastika, for some reason, did not fly any extras,
and Eunice 11. won, with Swastika and Livonia
second and third respectively. In the final, Sunny
South had four and a half minutes start to the
three minutes of Eunice 11. Again Sunny South led
from start to finish. Eunice was fourth on the list
for a long while, but gradually forced its way to
the tail of the leader, and came in second. Sunny
South, which had never been seriously threatened,
finished with a margin of 40sec. * #
Little Jimmy Hill, featherweight champion
of Australia, put up a good scrap in defence of his
title at the Olympia Stadium, Newtown, Sydney, on
Saturday night. He was matched with Sid Sullivan,
and Sid was just quarter of a pound lighter than
Hill, who weighed exactly Bst. 131 b. It was
easily the best and most brilliant fight the new
Stadium has witnessed. Four times the champion
was sent to the, floor, and four times he got up
again and resumed business at the old address. It
was a fine exhibition of pluck and determination.
But the loser made just as brave a show. During
the latter stages of the fight both his eyes were prac-
tically closed, and although he could only peer at his
elusive foe he fought like a wild cat to the finish.
The last time he knocked Hill down it was doubtful
if he knew he had done so. There was little between
them, but at the end the referee gave Hill the verdict
on points. #
At Brisbane, Frank Picato held converse
with the returned and much improved Ray Bronson,
who worried him with straight lefts and disparaged
his sad Italian face most grievously. Picato dealt
out staggering uppercuts which made Bronson often
regret he had ever seen the light of day. It was
not a spectacular fight, but a slogging match, in which
both boys showed Spartan endurance till the end,
when the referee declared it a ll .drawn battle. The
crowd made a hostile demonstration, apparently con-
dering Picato had won. In Melbourne, Frank Ellis,
of Maoriland, created a sensation by getting all oyer
'be promising local fighter, George Taylor. Taylor
did not reproduce the snap and force that had made
him so popular. The rapid evolutions of the Maori-
lander baffled him badly, and the uppercuts he landed
out made the Victorian wonder if the present centrali-
sation policy is all it might be. However, he weath-
ered the gale till the finish, and was defeated on
points only.
There is joy in Pugdom at the cabled
news that Beg Baker has managed to induce Jimmy
Clabby to return to Australia. Clabby is a mighty
warrior these days and his price is high; but the
Australian promoter fished with the right bait, and
James will leave for Australia early next month.
His first opponent here will probably be Jeff Smith,
and then McGoorty. He fought Jeff Smith in New
York in June, 1911, but as it was a 10-round no-
decision affair it does not shed much light on what
may happen in Australia.

THE BULLETIN.
The falling of Johnny Summers on Satur-
day last at Sydney Stadium was bewildering, pic-
turesque and sensational. As the prophet Bruserius
sayeth in the Fug’s Acopolysse, “He who goeth
looking for a knock-out shall surely catch it —on the
jaw.” Ordinarily, there is no more cautious be-
ginner than Summers. He usually advances to the
fray, like Agag, walking delicately, even as a cat
walks on eggs. He feels his man before mixing it,
and if his man tries to mix it the man finds Johnny
an elusive sprite. But on this occasion Johnny was
in such a hurry that he forgot to touch the scapular
in his sock. He had evidently made up his mind
that McCormick would outbox him if it went 20
rounds, and had determined to overwhelm McC. in
short order. At the word he bounded across the
ring, and fell upon his enemy like a long street
full of tigers. He smote with both fists. He hurled
all his weight into the contract, and pounded the
hostile person right across the ring, with showers
of body blows, varied by a few to the head which
McCormick covered desperately with his gloves. It
was the ropes that stopped McCormick’s wild re-
treat. Bringing up against them he rebounded, and
strove to clinch. Summers swung him round, threw
him away, cast him ofF, implied by his manner that
he had no use for him, and followed up. McCormick
uncovered his head and tried to smite. He was
despised and rejected. He tried to hang on and he
might as well have tried to drive a nail into the
side of the east wind and suspend himself thereto.
But the fiercest cyclone must blow itself out, and
so did Johnny. And the moment he subsided into a
calm McCormick, angered by ill-usage and aroused
by the way the audience urged Johnny to knock his
head off and throw it through the window, assumed
the offensive. He met a right swing in the chest
that nearly knocked him down, but recovering he
sprang again, and let fly a double broadside as he
did. Then it was Summers who broke ground while
he gathered steam for another cyclone. He backed
away till the northern ropes blocked him, and
McCormick hurled himself at him amidst much
pandemonium. Summers is most dangerous on the
ropes, and some historic bashes were exchanged.
Dropping his fists he played for the body,
McCormick gasped as if a piano had fallen on him.
But all the same he never stopped hitting. Two
lefts landed on Summers’s mouth. Then McCormick
was standing in close, and seeing Johnny’s face un-
protected drove a right short-arm jolt right to the
point. The recipient pitched forward on to his
knees and gloves. He was knocked unconscious,
and still had enough in him to protect himself as he
fell. He came down and tried to stop on his gloves
and knees, but everything faded out and he again
pitched forward till his forehead touched the floor
a few inches from where Waldemar Holberg had
gone down, all out, before Hughie Mehegan. But
Holberg fell forward on his chin, Summers on his
forehead. The roar ceased. A silence crashed
down on the Stadium, and the voice of Scott calling
the count sounded something akin to a town hall
clock. Nobody believed that the mighty Summers,
the greatest ring general of them all, was out. He
was taking all the respite he could get, they said.
But when the voice of Scott boomed “eight they
roared that he had already taken a dashed lot of
respite and shouldn’t overdo it. “Nine came,
and the man on the floor was still taking heaps ot
respite. Even Scott looked amazed and hesitated
for the fraction of a second before he said “Out.
or whatever he did say, for his voice was drowned
in the multitude of the hoot. There are some awful
dingoes among the Stadium habitu&s. His seconds
dragged Summers to his feet and to his chair and doused
him with water, and then he opened two blue, bewil-
dered eyes and wondered what the riot was about.
It was a blow that would have felled a bullock, but
the hardy little ex-fireman was soon able to get up
and scramble through the ropes from the arena in
which he had scored so many brilliant victories.
From the moment Scott had said “Box on. till
Summers struck the floor was exactly 2mm 29sec.
But into that space of time had been crowded one ot
the most spectacular fights ever seen in the Stadium.
Country racegoers in Victoria are suffer-
ing something extra from a profitable but impudent
scheme pf “scaling.” Abraham O’Bellow lays the
odds, as per usual and when the last race has been
run coolly assures winning punters that he can
pay, having laid nothing else but the winner. Then
he hands bettors their stakes, and departs with
bulging pockets. Sometimes he gets jobbed ; some-
times, as at Shepparton, lately, he is chased mt
the committee room or the secretary s tent, and tnen
the Law guards him from assault and battery till
the swindled ones have departed. These are the
sort of facts which Ikey’s friend the pareon
ignores when someone points out that tne to
always pavs the mathematical odds in , f “ 11 ’ ess T A_
per cent., and never has to be protected bv the Lav
while infuriated punters chase it with blue m
and “langwidge.”

WHY THE HUMAN SYSTEM
NEEDS EXERCISE
Because it is a natural stimulant for replacing
the waste tissue of the human system.
Every effort you make causes the destruction of a
greater or less quantity of tissue in proportion to
the exertion involved.
This process is going on every minute of the day,
and, unless you exercise judiciously, the accumula-
tion of waste tissue will debilitate your system.
Of course, you may not notice the difference. It
is so gradual. But it certainly exists. It is ever
increasing, and always undermining your energy—
your health.
By performing a few simple, yet scientific, exer-
cises, such as those comprising the
Baker Course of
Health Exercises,
you immediately expel the destroyed or worn-out
tissue, and construct new tissue to take its place.
These HEALTH EXERCISES are very
beneficial. They are very thorough. They ensure a
copious, virile bloocl circulation. And a strong blood
circulation means nourishing and strengthening of
all the thews, sinews, nerve cells, etc., of your body.
The benefits to be gained are illustrated by results
others are securing. Here are a few typical letters
of many hundreds in my possession:—
“I feel splendid—never felt better in all my
life. Thanking you for the good your course
has done me.”—C.W.E., Maryland (N.S.W.).
“I have now had your fourth section of Physi-
cal Culture. The exercises are doing me the
world of good, and I am looking forward to the
ĥ
next section.”—H.B., Millicent, (S.A.).
“I am now thanking you for what you have done for me. Your exercises have built me into
a man. I have better health and strength than ever I had. I have tried Sandow’s grip dumb-bells,
but the Baker Exercises are the best. I have put on nearly a stone in weight.”—
F.W.G., Gatton (Q.).
“I think it is the best investment I have ever made, as I feel a lot better since I started your
lessons three weeks ago.”—E.V.T., Ingham, (Q.).

Secrets of Beauty
SELECTED RECIPES FROM HERE
AND THERE.—THINGS EVERY
WOMAN WANTS TO KNOW.
Getting Rid of
Female Moustaches.
“Practical Suggestions.”
To women who are annoyed by disfiguring downy
hair growths a method of. permanently eradicating
the same will come as a piece of good news. For
this purpose pure powdered pheminol may be used.
Almost any chemist should be able to supply an
ounce of this drug. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to remove the disfiguring growth
instantly, leaving no trace, but also to actually kill
the hair roots without irritating the skin. * * *
Objectionable body odors resulting from perspiration
and other causes may be instantly banished by
simply applying a little powdered (white) pergol to
the affected surface occasionally. * * * Smart
women are rapidly adopting the use of the natural
allacite of orange blossoms when the complexion is
inclined to be oily. It makes a capital greaseless
cream, holds the powder perfectly, and does not
encourage hair growths.
Naturally Wavy Hair.
“Home Chemistry.”
Good stallax not only makes the best possible
shampoo, but has the peculiar property of leaving
the hair with a pronounced natural “wave,” an
effect presumably desired by many ladies. A tea-
spoonful of the stallax granules, dissolved in a cup
of hot water is ample for a luxurious head wash,
and leaves the hair with a peculiar lustre and fluffi-
ness obtainable from nothing else as far as known.
It is perfectly harmless, and can be obtained from
most chemists, although since it has been so little
used for this purpose it comes only in sealed original
packages, enough to make up twenty-five or thirty
individual shampoos. * * * For an actual hair
grower nothing equals pure boranium. It is quite
harmless, and sets the hair roots tingling with new
life. * * * The use of rouge is almost always
obvious, but powdered colliandum gives a perfectly
natural color and defies detection.
Oxygen Removes a
Bad Complexion.
“Practical Suggestions.”
Oxygen is now used to clear the complexion. Its
peculiar property of destroying waste matter and not
injuring healthy tissue is well known. Bad com-
plexions are merely the accumulation of half-dead
waste matter on the skin surface. This accumulation
shows in the form of sallowness, moth patches and a
generally lifeless appearance. Smart women now
clear off these imperfections by getting some merco-
lised wax from the chemist’s, and applying it for a
few nights like cold cream. This wax contains
oxygen, which attacks and removes the disfiguring
waste matter. It is pleasant to use and perfectly
harmless.. The fresh, healthy skin which has been
covered up is soon revealed in all its beauty, and the
face so treated looks much younger and prettier as a
result. * * * To bring a natural red color
to the lips rub them with a soft stick of pro-
lactum. * * * For tired, hot or perspiring feet
use a teaspoonful of powdered onalite in a foot-
bath.
Home Beauty Aids.
“Household Hints.”
A persistently shiny nose or a dull, lifeless com-
plexion drives many a woman to cosmetics and con-
sequent despair. And all the time a simple remedy
lies at hand in the home. If you have no cleminite
in the house you need only get about an ounce from
your chemist and add just sufficient water to dis-
solve it. A little of this simple lotion is Nature’s
own beautifier. It is very good for the skin, and
instantly gives the complexion a soft, velvety, youth-
ful bloom that any woman might envy. It lasts all
day or evening, renders powdering entirely unneces-
sary, and absolutely defies detection. * * * To
make the eyelashes grow long, dark and curling,
apply a little mennaline with the finger tips occa-
sionally. It is absolutely harmless, and beautifies
the eyebrows as well. * * * Pilenta soap is the
most satisfactory for all complexions. It even works
well in cold or hard water.

pleased lam with the .280 Ross. X.ast
season in Cassiar, B. C. I went after 13
head and bagged the lot, at ranges
varying from 60 to 500 yards in 27 shots.
My bag consisted of 3 Black Bear, 4
Grizzlies, 2 Goat, 2 Cariboo, 2 Moose.
In my estimation
ĥ
there is no rifle to compare with
the "Ross .280.”
The balance is perfect, the action
fast and smooth while the flatness
of trajectory quite does away with
the judging of distances.

The Inky Way.
“J.F.H.” (from London) : There have been journal-
istic high jinks here on the 80th birthday of Lord
Burnham, principal proprietor of the Daily Tele-
graph. Congratulatory addresses were piled upon
him from the journalists of the Empire, the staffs of
the D.T., and the congregation of the Christian
Church. Lord Northclilfe, head of the Harms-
worths, presented the general journalistic address
with a speech thickly coated with marmalade. Burn-
ham and Northcliffe at one time were at bitter war.
but they have now agreed to tolerate each other’s
presence in the universe. In those days of strife,
Northcliffe objected very strongly to Burnham's
proclamation of the first leading article that the
D.T. had the “largest circulation of any morning
paper in London” ; but peace was eventually secured
by Burnham’s rag inserting “penny” before “morn-
ing,” thereby practically conceding the champion
circulation to its pushful half-penny rival. Burn-
ham has spent 60 years in Fleet-street, London’s
great inky highway, and looks like going strong for
another 10. He is the working patriarch of the
profession. In a reminiscent speech he mentioned
that his first job was packing and tying up the
parcels in the publishing office of the London
Sunday Times.

Papua has just witnessed the preliminary canter in
its very first libel action. The suit was brought by
Dr. W. M. Strong, lately Acting Chief Medical
Officer for the Possession, against the Papuan Times,
the lone but very vigorous representative of the Press
in the big island. The cause of the disturbance
was the smallpox epidemic in Sydney, the local
voice of the people making certain remarks on the
doctor’s work in administering the Quarantine Or-
dinance. Because of these remarks he howled for
£lOOO damages. Both parties were represented by
cost-pursuers, who are almost as rare as Great Auk’s
eggs in Papua, and amidst the unsuppressed excite-
ment of the inhabitants the doctor obtained a verdict
for £250. Defendant, who was formerly in the Papuan
public service and is no friend of Lieut-Governor
Murray, is appealing to the High Court of Australia
-—the first case to go there from Australia’s nigger
dependency.
The newest mine of any consequence opened up in
Maoriland is at Whangarei, and the treasure consists
of a faded sheet of manuscript that is alleged to be
either the original or a copy in the author’s writing
of Burns’s “Scots Wha Hae.” Photographs of the
manuscript were sent to the curator of the Burns
Museum at Ayr, in Scotland, for identification, and a
reply has come to hand stating that the goods are
genuine, but whether they are the original or merely
a copy in Burns’s handwriting cannot be ascertained.
Burns is known to have made several copies of his
shrill poem, one being purchased some years ago for
the Ayr Museum. At the top of the Whangarei
manuscript there is the inscription “To my sister-in-
law,” which may be the means of definitely tracing
its career later on. Anyhow, without more being
known about it, the expert sends out the glad news
that the scrap of paper is worth over £3OO.
“Plattypussy”: I can understand the indignation
of the Maoriland newspaper proprietors when their
scribes began forming themselves into unions and
registering in the Arbitration Court. The ordinary
staffman’s pay was previously bad enough (it is
still mean and paltry), but the free-lance writer is
sweated in a way that even M.L. newspaper pro-
prietors, with th r notoriously cheap-labor tradi-
tions, might be expected to be ashamed of. One
paper which, during the period of the late waterside
strike, loudly proclaimed itself on the side of “labor,”
offers its contributors 12s. 6d. per column for either
prose or verse, which pans out at about 7d. per inch.
It evidently believes that all laborers should be well
paid except those who labor for its columns.
Another pays for its matter (verse or prose) at the
rate of 7-id. per inch. Still another, when it does
accept fiction, pays or has paid me, at less than 3d.
per inch. Some of these sharks announce that all
accepted contributions are paid for, but unless you
hang to them like a bum bailiff no money material-
ises. Generally, applications for it are stalled by
the information that the verse, story, sketch or para-
graph w r as “not up to standard,” but was inserted
with the philanthropic desire to encourage the writer.
Some people call this sort of thing a harsh name,
but maybe they are prejudiced. Anyhow, the law
of libel prevents me discussing it.
John Plummer, probably the oldest inky-way man
in regular toil in N. S. Wales, had to seek the
shelter of the North Sydney Hospital a week or so
back. For most of his 35 years in Sydney he has
drawn his income chiefly from English papers with
which he was connected in earlier days. His most
prominent work in Sydney was on the old Illus-
trated News and Tribune, but the best he has
done of late has been for the Year Book op Aus-
tralia. He is now in his 83rd year.

“Leo Lear”: Newspapers that pass out don’t al-
ways leave memorial stones in loving remembrance.
Such an one is the Portland (Vic.) Herald, about
which I can ferret out nothing; birth, disease, and
death are all forgotten. Yet that it existed I know
from a sheet preserved in an old ledger. Even J. R.
Kean, the proprietor of the Portland Guardian (a
paper that dates back without a break to 1842—a
record unequalled by any other Victorian print)
doesn’t remember anything about the Herald. My
copy is dated “Friday Evening, February 11, 1853,”
and consists largely of an elaborate exposition of
“An Act for the Prevention of the Disease Galled Scab
in Sheep.” Some of the advertisements are rather
ambiguous. For instance:—
“A Gentleman of Large Dimensions has taken from
a Poor Woman a £5 in mistake for a £1 note and
refuses to give it back.”
And there is at least one suffragette, who advertises,
cautioning all persons “against speaking prejudicial
to the undersigned without having just cause.” Also
one G. Lowe shows how the cost of living has risen
in the present decade by announcing that he is ready
to tear himself apart from 121 b. of beef in exchange
for Is. 6d.
* * * *
“Stamps”: The first record of penny postage in
N. S. Wales that I can find was in a series of post-
office charges published in Governor Macquarie’s
time, though probablv the system was in existence
earlier. The list sets out that “soldiers’ letters or
those addressed to their wives” shall be delivered for
one penny. English or foreign letters cost the civilian
Bd.; parcels under 201 b. cost Is. 6d. and, over 201b. f
Bs. Within N, S. Wales the letter postage was 4d.

Simple Randolph met a Tyson
Going to the fair.
Said Simple Randolph to the Tyson:
“Why not brush your hair?”
Said the Tyson unto Randolph:

And somehow that quaint view of it
Knocked simple Randolph bandy.
Then, hurrying away in a state of considerable moral
exhilaration,
lie hurriedly canonised Tyson for saving the nation —
As well as saving his money and being perfectly free
from all traces of affectation.
And when some unbelievers rose up and remarked
that his new saint was spurious,
Randolph tore off his three-acre hat and denounced
them in writing most furious.

PHOSFERJ.NE is Nature's own Nerve-cell restorer. The broken up tissues and
cells in the Eody are reconstructed and built up—given new life and vitality by
PHOSFERINE. You swallow life when you swallow PHOSFERINE, and it spreads
through all i>arts ot yout body—through the bruin, the bone, the nerve and the
muscle—strengthening it and making you vigorous and healthy.
Mrs. Brown Potter, the celebrated actress, whose rare combination of beauty and
genius has captivated the world, states that it its only PHOSFERINE that enables
her to withstand the great emotional strain and exhaustion of her work.
Mrs. Brown Potter writes: "I am both delighted and satisfied with the excellent
results 1 have derived trom PHOSFERINE. In all r mv experience I have not found
any tonic as beneficial and agreeable, or one that so quickly dispels the headache
and langour consequent on great mental exertion. After the fatigue of a long, tedious
journey, or ot playing a particularly strenuous part Kke ' Madam X,’ when the muscles
are limp and the nerves ot the whole body are quivering and jangled, there is no liner
restorative than a dose ol PHOSFERINE. ■ Unquestionably, 1 feel more intensely alert
and vigorous after taking PHOSFERINE, and consider its unfailing efficacy deserving
of the widest publicity. If anything lean add to mv own appreciation, it is the fact that
my mother enjoys splendid health and an entire freedom from Influenza and Neuralgia
ever since she began to take PHOSFERINE.’’-- April 7th. 1910.

“O. C. Cabot” : A week or two ago you printed
some remarks (from the scene of dryness)
concerning the Swindle capital site at Yass-
Canberra. Here are some more. About a
year ago—maybe a little more —the Sydney
Telegraph published a huge picture en-
titled “Junction of the Molonglo and the
Murrumbidgee at the Federal Capital Site.”
The photo., which was taken as near after
the break-up of the (then) partial drought
as could be arranged, showed about 37 miles
of water rolling down like the Ashburton
(W.A.) in flood-time —in* fact, there was so
much water in the picture that only a tree
and two mosquitoes could be found room for
in the offing. On Monday last the Tele-
graph published a telegram (perhaps from
its truthful fishing-expert, who described the
famous Cotter as “a chain of waterholes”)
concerning the mighty Molonglo, which read:
The Government is confining work at the capital
to the construction of the Cotter River waterworks
and power station. The Molonglo Hirer has ceased
running at Canberra.
This is borne out by the picture (also re-
printed by the D.T.. August 26, 1912) by
Joseph Wolinski, of “The Molonglo at Yar >
Canberra.” The artist shows a veritable
“chain of waterholes,” with sandy bottom
and a few bulrushes, a rather rustic spot,
but absolutely insane as the source of the
water-supply of the capital of all Australia.
When will Cook and Kelly allow the truth
to come out? A quarter of a million has
been wasted on the present absurd “site,”
and now things are so bad tha t even the Can-
berra crowd thinks of abandoning the place.
To the surprise of many people who re-
garded William John Lyne as a chronic
pauper, his will has been proved at £17,862.
The governor of the Commonwealth Bank
(Denison Miller), Walter G. Parish (soli-
citor), and the widow are the executors.
The bulk of the estate represents shares in
public cos.
Newtown, one of the most breathless sub-
urbs of congested Sydney, has an old tumble-
down cemetery which someone or other
wants to have “converted into a quiet place
of rest for the citizens” —not the dead citi-
zens who are resting there already, but the
live rent-payers. The optimist reckons that
a “lung” will thereby be added to a very
stuffy area. So with a vast hinterland
simply aching for population, and empty
ports crying out for occupation, some of
Sydney’s citizens have to get into a grave-
yard to breathe. This is a mad woi’ld, but
parts of it are madder than others.
A Sydney policeman found a burglar the
other night and immediately conceived an
intense longing to make him his burglar.
Being a constable, he was a large man speci-
ally trained and equipped to catch burglars.
Like the rest of his class, he was even clad
in special burglar-catching clothes. He
wanted a burglar more than a drink, or an
enlarged photograph of his wife, or a free
pass for a picture show. Even had such a
transaction been in order, a benevolent third
party couldn’t have kept him from his right-
ful burglar with an offer of ss. and an en-
graving of the Battle of the Boyne. The
burglar, on the other hand, wanted to get
away from the officer more than anything in
life. His soul boiled within him at the very
sight of the cop, and he desired to retire and
spend a long evening with all his wife’s re-
lations, or a bag of venomous snakes —any-
thing rather than go with the peeler.
However, principally on account of
the bobby’s shark-like eagerness, these
two dissimilar individuals came together
with a thud, and the subsequent pro-
ceedings were dusty and vicious, because
they were both frightfully in, earnest and
wanted to do different things.’ The trap
won, and next day the brilliant evening
paper came out like this in a perfect rash
of head-lines : “BURGLAR AND POLICE-
MAN-DESPERATE STRUGGLE.” And
straightway it occurred to everybody that a
struggle—but more particularly a burglar-
policeman struggle—to be of any use at all,
must be desperate. It really isn’t worth
while taking part in if it is to be merely
suggestive of crewel work or Limerick lace
or Venetian glass or chess or soap-bubbles.
From an authority on town-planning:—
One of the worst specimens of municipal vandalism
is the new traffic road from Woolloomooloo Bay, Syd-
ney, to Park-street. This splits Cook and Phillip
Parks in halves and cuts a swathe off the Domain,
and thus takes a big slice off the not-too-extensive
recreation grounds of Sydney. The designers of this
scheme deliberately left the big area of slum houses
on the east of the route, and chose to cut a portion
of the Domain away on the west. Thus they spoiled
a portion of the Domain while carefully preserving
the slums. It is understood that this vandalism was
perpetrated by a combination of the Wade Govern-
ment and the much-boosted Allen Taylor regime at
the Town Hall. It was decided in the teeth of such
obvious arguments as these: (1) That the preserva-
tion intact of the open spaces of a city is a duty
every generation owes to its successors and itself;
(2) that a Royal Commission on the improvement of
Sydney reported against this route, and recommended
the widening and regrading of Cathedral-street and
the continuation of that street by tunnel to Rush-
cutter’s Bay, thus linking up the eastern foreshore
suburbs for tram and vehicular purposes and avoiding
the hill-climbing and bottle-necking at (fog. top of
William-street; (3) that a danger zone is created at
the intersection of Boomerang-street with the new
street. One can imagine the whole of the Eastern-
foreshore suburbs tram traffic being held up morning
after morning while the big lorry traffic from the
Woolloomooloo wharves lumbers up the hill across the
tram line with a painful cracking of whips, lashing
of horses and drivers’ objurgations. The same City
Council which was particeps criminis in this piece
of crude vandalism repeated the guilt and folly of a
bygone predecessor by giving another lease of a por-
tion of the park to a private bowling-club, to the ex-
clusion of the public, save a 8 spectators. It now pro-
poses to hand over the new golf links at Moore Park
to a private club —an unheard-of thing. Why, even
the most famous of the Scottish links is open to the
public on payment of a small fee! But my main
objection is to the filching of park spaces for public
uses. Let us get in now with a protest, or we will
have to face the Allen Taylor -project to cut a road
through Hyde Park from Market-street to St. Mary’s,
with the corollary of the present piece of vandalism,
viz., the widening of Park-street at the expense of
Hyde Park. I have no objection to the lowering of
Park-street, with an arched cover extending the park
and letting traffic go under the park surface, like the
fine Quirinale tunnel in Rome; but the queen spaces
of Sydney should be fought for to the last inch. The
present City Council wants close watching. It will
sell the park if we don’t look out.

Ideal
Hot Water
Boiler.
Fhe Up-to-date is Imperative
—in Architectural Advice—)
THAT building that is being “builded” to-day has got to be a useful
building half a century hence. Therefore, every Architect knows
how imperative it is that it should be up-to-date. Were the ideas
of a century ago introduced to that building, it would be a tremendous
mistake that would grow bigger every day.
Hanks 1 are Sole 'Agents for the most up-to-date Heating
Systems , and stock every requirement.
The Traditional Hob goes —the
more effective Radiator arrives—
The Steam or Hot Water Radiation System is far more uniform, healthful and economical for houses
of any dimension. This is amply demonstrated beyond all doubt. It simply means the installation
of an IDEAL BOILER, which is fed with coal or coke, the necessary Radiators in all parts where
heat is required, and the pipes. This System is used exclusively in the most up-to-date buildings in
America, including the great hotels, the famous Elatiron structure, as well as in the Continental and
English Hostel ries, and the homes of the people. Our unique Eree Book gives information and
pictures, in half-tone and colors, of exteriors and interiors of places using the IDEAL SYSTEM.

Ideal Boilers for Hot Water Supply and Low
Pressure Dry Steam for Cooking Purposes.
Every modern hotel, residential fiat or large catering establishment should be planned
with provision for the installation of these most efficient, common-sense and economical
Systems, which are endorsed in almost every city in the world. The matter of cost is very
moderate, and, as well, the boilers do not require shilled attention. Onr expert will be
pleased to give all information, estimates, etc.
Our Systems have been and are being installed in the following well-known establish-
ments, and many others: —
Coogee Bay Hotel, Emigrants’ Home, Tumut Hospital, Goulburn Hospital, “Ritz,”
Cremorne, Sydney Hospital, Orange Lands Office, Military College, Duntroon,
' Wentworth Hotel, and at most of the nurseries and private hot-houses.

Cleaning the teeth with
tooth powders or pastes can never, under any cir-
cumstances, preserve them from destruction.
That follows from the simple fact that the parts
most exposed to injury—the backs of the molars, the
interstices between the teeth, and the cavities in
them —are the very parts which remain untouched
by tooth powders and tooth pastes.
In consequence, mischief once commenced in
these places, advances undisturbed.
But Odol, being liquid, can penetrate the minutest
crevices, and, as it has a real antiseptic effect, lasting
for hours, arrests all bacterial and fermentation processes
which destroy the teeth.

IN
BANANA LAND
Old John Connolly was the centre to
which all things gravitated at the opening
of the Gayndah-Mundubberra railway a few
days ago. The old gentleman, who claims
to be 98, strolled amiably round conversing
with the. ladies —especially the beautiful
ones, which means that he conversed with
them all, for all ladies are beautiful up
there. The “father of Gayndali” intends to
see his century out, and will almost cer-
tainly be found cutting wood on the morning
of his hundredth birthday.
Passed out the other day in Brisbane
Hospital, Jasper Harvey, an old Liberal
battler, who ran more unsuccessful contests
than any other Tory politician in Banana-
land. Jasper had a wonderful knack of say-
ing the right thing in the wyong place; of
picking’ a gooj constituency at a bad time,
and of tacklipg a bad constituency at all
Sorts of times. He died, as fie had lived,
exhorting Liberalism against Labor, and pro-
foundly dissatisfied witfi tfie slackness of his
own party.
. R, R. Howard, the best Protector of Abo-
rigines that Queensland ever had, lias re-
signed, and the reason can be put into two
words, “Mornington Island.” Dr. Mjoberg,
the Swedish ethnologist (B. 12/2/T4),'refers
to the fact that the Presbyterian mission is
about to invade this last, lone stronghold
of the Australian Binglii, and bitterly de-
plores the intention. For years Howard has
been battling to prevent the evil missionary
thing, but the pull of the Wowser has proved
too strong for him. For this the blame lies
at the door of Home Sec. George Appel, who
has. some weird idea that Black Brudder has
a right to “salvation.” Unfortunately you
can’t “save” Black Brudder without first
“civilising” him —and “civilisation” is the
end of poor Black Brudder every time. He
isn’t of much value, but some of him should
be preserved as a curio. And the missionary
to end him even as a curio.
Old John Branston, who arrived in Bris-
bane in 1859 as private secretarv to Gov-
ernor Bowen, was lately found ‘doddering
about Wimbledon (Eng.), hale, hearty and
financially comfortable. He and Herbert,
the first Queensland Premier, were fellow-
students at Oxford, and, having much the
same tastes, were inseparable in Brisbane.
Bowen, indeed, relied on Branston and Her-
bert to enable him to set up Responsibe
Government. Both had civil-service apti-
tudes, but neither was much of a politician.
Branston, nevertheless, gave up his secre-
taryship, became member for the Burnett,
and was Attorney-General for a time. But
he was the sort of man who wants a steady
billet, hence he applied for the Attorney-
Generalship of Hong Kong, and got it and
took over an Acting-Judgeship. Even that
wasn’t steady enough, so he got a billet in
the Colonial Office in London and pigeon-
holed documents with such precision that in
time he was appointed Under-Secretary.
That just suited him, and he held the billet
for nearly a quarter of a century, retiring
on a pension. Ilis eminent services as
pigeon-holer brought him a knighthood. He
is now well past 80.
PROOF POSITIVE.
COUNTRY B UTCHER (to customer with a complaint): "What? Not lamb! Well, perhaps
yer'll believe me when I tell yer that that joint was a cut orf that pet lamb o'
Bob Smith's wot he ’ad for years and years,”
A Rockhampton man has just put up
what ought to be an Australian record by
being turned down for the sixth consecutive
time nt the local municipal elections. Even
Joshua, the son of Nun, had only to make
seven fries before he got the run of the
mayor’s parlor in the city of Jericho, and
that was regarded as something extra in the
way of persistence.
“X.P.D.”: The latest candidates offering
themselves in the anti-priekly-pear contest
are Rasmussen, of Melbourne, and Pawley,
of California. Rasmussen reckons he can
tear the terror from the ground with a
machine he has, and make jelly of the fruit
and other things of commercial value from
the leaf-fibre. Pawley puts his trust in a
novel kind of traction-engine to crush the
curse flat so that poison can be effectively
administered. Any one of the tried or pro-
posed methods would probably kill anything
but prickly-pear. That devil of desolation
defiantly waves its spikes at them all, and
nothing short of pulling it up by the roots,
mincing it fine, dipping it in molten
lava and smoking it in Slieol for 1400
years seems likely to seriously affect its
health. Meanwhile, it is spreading to the
extent of a million acres a year.
“Milky White”: The par. (B. 5/2/T4)
about the “finger-cherry” being a pest says
that the Government promises to eradicate
it—some day. Well, the finger-cherry
(Rliodomyrtus macrocarpa ), even though,
“proclaimed,” isn’t a pest; so there ! Its
fruit sometimes is infested by a fungus,
Gloeosporium periculosum, which is strongly
suspected of having caused the death of sev-
eral kids who overloaded their tummies with
diseased berries. On another charge more
than suspicion exists: it is certain that, even
as p-. : fy is to politicians, so is the fungus to
thus* who eat of infested cherry-berries—it
causes blindness. Still, the fungus doesn’t
work in the dark, so to speak ; it forms little
yello\v spots on the fruit and so renders the
diseased berries readily identifiable. If
Queenslanders are wise they’ll chase the
Government up until it gets Gloeosporium
periculosum into a dark corner and lets the
public debt fall upon it heavily. It isn’t
certain that G.p. will not attack other fruits,
and we don’t want a nation smitten with
physical as well as political blindness.
Home Sec. Appel, in many respects the
most liberal of Denham’s Ministers, has one
curious kink. The other day a Free Speech
deputation saw him, and got this amazing
remark thrown at it:—
It Joseph McCabe [McCabe is a science lecturer
of world-wide reputation] asked me to allow him
to speak on a Sunday, if I interfered at all it would
be to see that he did not get a permit.
Some day, during an outbreak of anti-Ger-
man hysteria, some narrow-minded zealot,
sitting in Appel’s place, will refuse to any
person with such a sauerkraut name as
Appel the right to get up and show that the
Germans in Queensland are good, peaceable
citizens; and when that happens the Appels
will see what it means to stifle free speech.
Meantime, while Appel is prepared to shut
the mouth of the scholarly scientist, he is
willing to let the most ignorant ranter in
the country talk endlessly, at all times and
places, concerning a great fish that swal-
lowed Jonah and delivered him none the
worse for wear after three days’ cold storage.
“Boro-Belle”: Mulgrave Central Mill,
Cairns, a farmers’ co-operative concern,
holds the belt for having paid, on the aboli-
tion of the sugar bounty, the highest price,
of any mill in Queensland, for cane last
season, the amount being 31s. a ton. Inci-
dentally, Bananaland’s sugar industry is!
bounding ahead at a greater pace than the
mills can keep up with. A large new mill
(John Drysdale’s) is nearing completion at
Inkerman, near Townsville, capable of turn*-
b’g out 10,000 tons of sugar in a season)
The Government is erecting another big
mill at Babinda, near Cairns, which will be
crushing next year, while a second Govern-
ment mill goes up at South Johnstone to
crush in 1916. At Cairns, extensive new
areas are being put under cane cultivation.
This remark also applies to Mackay, where
an agitation is being started to encourage
the erection of a huge mill, capable of turn-
ing out 60,000 tons of sugar in a season-
just 3000 tons more than Mackay’s output
from its 10 factories last season.

When the black drop in your vitals plays

Do not feel your bumps in wonder or invoke

And I’ll wager ev’ry dollar you’ll discover

QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, February 14, 1914.
1 My Dear Thargomindah,—
The walking delegate of the Australian
governors’ Unindustrious Union of Vice-regal
Sundowners informs me that the Macgregor
Bady Mac pulled into Brisbane on
lliursday after a fortnight spent in beating
up the available agricultural shows and hos-
pitable stations on the Darling Downs. After
untying the swags, his Ex.’s mate, Talbot,
who, like Henry Lawson’s old pal, Mitchell,
does the battling, went on to Sydney, where,
I understand, the going is Rood.
This afternoon Sir AVilliam, with Charles
Mackellar to the right and Lady Macgregor
to the left, a bodyguard of aldermen and their
skirted halves, and the popular private sec-
retary, Captain Foxton, one pace to the
rear, successfully brought into action a large
and formidable f&te in support of a local
School of Arts. The disquieting feature of
the show was a polite message, received by
each of the newspaper offices. The messen-
ger, who breathed the remarks per ’phone,
urged in roundabout but unmistakable lan-
guage that a large, hobnailed reporter should
be sent, as it: was no place for a female
reporter. This may have been a reflection
on the capacity of mere woman for liquids,,
but I saw nothing to bear out the suspicion..
Indeed, everybody was perfectly sedate and;
sober. Even the Governor walked respect-
ably, and if he had worn a crayfish in his.
buttonhole I would certainly have noticed i
it. I don’t know what the girls expected,,
but every scribe present was a lady.
Mrs. Ricardo, the handsome widow of the *
late Colonel Ricardo, is to be married next
Wednesday in your city to Mr. A. Street,,
an American with, a plentiful pyramid of
dollars. The lady has many friends here..
She is the daughter of that bluff
and well liked old medico, the late Dr. Jolini
Thomson. Dr. Jack Thomson, her brother,,
married Miss Elsie Forsyth, of Sydney, who>
is now numbered among the ranks of our-
best-dressed younger matrons.
Two other hitchings timed for Wednes*--
day will link Dolly Jardine (who has £&00i
a year of her own) to Donald Cameron, off
Kensington Downs; and Roy Murray,, som
of John Murray, M.L.C. (once Minister foir
Education), to Miss Moody, daughter of the*
manager of the Warwick branch, of the*
Q.N. Bank.
Miss Jardine is staying with the Cecil!
Palmers until after her wedding. The offi--
cial breakfast will be gnawed at the Oeeill
Palmer mansion.
There were two weddings this week. One;,
at St.. Stephen’s Cathedral, was a very, sky-
towering affair. Cecelia Beirne, the pretti-
est of T. C. Beirne’s five daughters, tools
for as much better as possible and as littlb*
worse as may be H. A. C. Douglas. The
little bride trailed soft white crepe de chine
draperies, and was cheered up by her sister
Eileen, who brightened the proceedings in
white crgpe de chine, topped off by a pretty
pink hat. The decorations were in pink and
white at the cathedral and at Hendra, where
the Beirnes live. The bridegroom’s father
was once Administrator of Thursday Island
and before that he was Premier of Queens-
land. The other knot-tying was squatter
Hunter, of Hythe station, to Doris Webster,
step-daughter of W. R. O. Hill.
Mrs. Hobbs, widow of the late Dr. Hobbs,
and mother of the two lawyers of that name,
died this week.
The Society for the Suppression of Savagese.
got cash and applause to-night, when Palace-
Gardens was re-opened by Charlie
liagen, champion wrestler and pastrycook. _
The takings of the night went to the sofiifty-
already mentioned. Ilis Ex. and Lady Mac, ,
the new Mayor and Mayoress of Brisbane, .
the Acting-Premier and Mrs. Barnes, and a
choice and varied assortment of Ministers ;
and members were there. Tessie Mulcahy
uplifted a contralto, and Fred Watson a
baritone, without any opposition from the -
audience calling for special remark.
The Amateur Swimming Championships ;
of Queensland were swum off to-night. Alice ■
Alexander again beat Elsie Vennings for the ■
Junior by a few inches, and the Senior •
Championship remained with Mabel Spring-
field, the holder.
Women committees are rather illogical. I.'
don’t believe even J. S. Mill could have been
logical in a whalebone environment and a
tango skirt, to say nothing of a hat covered
with fowls’ skins, ti-tree and other vege-
tables. Where was I, my dear? Oh, yes; at
a recent meeting of the State School Girls’
Amateur Swimming Association, it was
suggested in all seriousness that one girl who
had distinguished herself by winning a num-
ber of championships should be disqualified
because the other girls had no chance, against
her. Luckily, the suggestion was squashed,
otherwise an awkward precedent w r ould have
been established of eliminating winners until
the last lone water-sluggard beat herself by
a head and the pastime became a hack
number.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

NERVE AND BRAIN FOOD TABLETS
Are the scientific result of the research work of the
world’s greatest authorities and specialists. They
build up the nervous system by a process of natural
nutrition, and benefit gained is lasting and perma-
nent. Antineurasthin as a NERVE FOOD gives
wonderful results in physical and mental overstrain
and exhaustion, and on account of its beneficial effect
upon THE BLOOD is invaluable in cases of Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc. Antineurasthin shows remarkable
effect upon THE PROCESS OF NUTRITION,
and marked and immediate benefit in complaints
arising from weak digestion, dyspepsia, and mal-
nutrition. Antineurasthin expedites growth, en-
riches the blood (by an increase of red corpuscles)
and restores it to a healthy condition. It increases
mental activity and generally strengthens the nervous
system as well as the physique. Its administration
produces wonderful results in weak children as well
as in those affected with Rickets.

KNOWLEDGE, IS POWER
Thirty years of assiduous study of The Hair and its Treatment, and all
Capillary Diseases as they affect the Scalp and Hair, have given me the means
of Preserving the Hair, and producing a new growth, after all other preparations
have failed.
Mr. Fred Peakman, of Wairoa, New Zealand, is another wonderful case. His hairdresser tells me
he had not a scrap of hair, and now, after a few months’ treatment with my preparations, he has
got a splendid growth of hair.
Mr. O’ltourke, Wee Waa, New South Wales, writes: “My head, which was nearly hald, has now
come back to its usual growth.”
___ r - Sutherland states: “I had only a little down on my head when I commenced to use vour
SPECIAL PARASENE and COSMO LOTION ; now I have a beautiful head of hair.”
Gentlemen who are going bald should use Special Parasene and CosillO Lotion, one at
night and the other in the morning, and wash the head once a week with Shampima.
Price (with postage, two months’ treatment): Victoria, 12/-; four months, 22/6. Other
States, 12/6 and 23/6.
Ladies with hair falling out should apply Restorer at night, and Cosmo Lotion in the
morning, and wash the head as often as necessary with Shainpuna.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Buka: Following information is too late,
“The ceraining ef fire armes buy ‘Celia Lloyd’ in a
recent Bulletin gold uruch further than 12 years.”
Why didn’t you cable it?. . . .Nightowl: Not right.
....Nickols: Wouldn’t print it at advertising rates.
....Shareholder: Never heard of it... .G.M.8.: To
answer that question we would need the run of
the C.S.K. Co.’s books; and even the Common-
wealth Government hasn’t the power to call for such
an examination.... Lisbey: If the child was born
here he could return; if born in China, he could be
barred.... Constant Reader: Don’t know what the
Binghi words “Banyabba” and “Gundaroo” mean.
Possibly they don’t mean anything. Possibly there
are no such words Camoo: Fact, no doubt; but
where’s the point of it? F.A.W.: Don’t know.
The B. certainly never said he was the only judge
of the fine arts in Maoriland. .. . F.A.F.: The Exter-
nal Affairs Dept, has charge of the business of
naturalisation. There are five essentials. The suc-
cessful applicant (1) must not be an aboriginal
native of Asia, Africa or the Islands of the Pacific,
excepting M.L. ; (2) must have lived continuously
in the Commonwealth for two years; (3) must in-
tend to make this his home; (4) must be of good
repute; and (5) must take the oath or affirmation
of allegiance. No fee is charged for a certificate. .. .
Swamper: This is what A. 11. S. Lucas (ex-president
of the Linnean Society of N.S.W., of the Field
Naturalists’ Club of Victoria and of the Naturalists’
Club of N.S.W.), and W. It. Dudley Le Souef (direc-
tor of Melb. Zoo) say in their authoritative book,
“The Animals of Australia” (chapter, kangaroos and
wallabies) : “The large tail is employed as a third
limb to the tripod when the animal is sitting up at
rest and as a counterpoise to the forepart of the
body when in rapid advance and, at such times, does
not touch the ground.” In a paragraph dealing with
the common or great grey kangaroo the authors
state: “The tail does not touch the ground when
the animals are leaping, but when they are feeding
and moving slowly they rest their weight upon it while
they move their feet.” “When they are fighting,” says
Mr. Le Souef, “they stand on their toes and lean
back on the end of the tail; and when they kick for-
ward the whole of the weight of the body is sup-
ported by the tai1.”.... Ginger: The sub-editor whose
specialty was reading copy that had been written
on blotting-paper with an old thumb dipped in tar
is no longer on the staff. He found life too strenu-
ous, and forwarded his resignation to Father Time.
... .Pa P.: Idea is all right, but you haven’t worked
it up sufficiently.... Crib-time: Nothing of any value.
....Seaside: Forced humor of a very tame feminine
variety.... E. A.C.: Thousands of miles of verse just
like that have been rejected. Probably some millions
of miles more will go streaming down to perdition
before something happens to stop it....1.K.: “Pay-
ment desired.” Not for that, surely I Eleanor
M.: No.... Vic: Too much “Oh” and a great deal
too much “ye.”... .Nellie S. L.: Verses are just 16.
....Stanley S.: You (singing): “I often look back
on the days of my childhood.” Us: “The Devil
you do !”... .Summer B.: There is an excess of lim-
pid woodland verse this week, also a surplus of dells,
brooks and other accessories. .. .W.J. (V.): Just two
lines from your tremendous poem on motherhood—at
least, it appears to be primarily about motherhood,
though accurate diagnosis is almost impossible:—
Shall you be the one now to scoff at the ways of the
fallen ?■—•
Or smear with his offal deriders so un-anthropoid?
Doesn’t simple language appeal to you, or do you
write like that naturally? R.N.C. (Brisbane): It
isn’t much of a story, and the place to which Bill
rushes should be kept o t of literature as much as
possible. .. .J.W.A.: Because you suffer from asthma
why should we be afflicted with the poetry you write
when you can’t get to sleep? P.R.W.: Unsuitable.
....H. Henry: Flablv. underdone verse. ... R.N.C.:
Heavy rhymed goods. .. .J.W.A.: Did you ever hear
a man who dropped his final g’s use the quaintly
absurd word “moot”? Z. (V.): Your pome be
upon your own head :—•
MEMORIES.
Dawn.
Dost remember, love of mine, though time slips
’neath our feet,
How Hope, our golden sun, arose, and all seem’d so
complete ?
Thy love for me, and mine for thee ; doth it remain
a sweet,
Fond memory?
Twilight.
Dost remember how the Shadows, length’ning fast
apace
Diffused, obscured like fading dreams from me thy
lovely face ?
Ah, dost thou sit and ponder, is the thought of Love’s
embrace
Foncl Memory ?
Eventide.
The sweetest rose that blooms must fade, pleasure
fraught with pain,
As to a thirsting flower the welcome drop of rain
Thy love for me, and mine for thee, for ever will
remain
Fond Memory.
. ...A Jaysee: No interest. .. .Tomato Joe: Available
authorities, including H. J. Rumsey, who was sec-
retary of N.S.W. Chamber of Agriculture, member
of Assoc, of Seedsmen and Nurserymen, etc., de-
scribe it as a fruit. Fool questions like that have no
time wasted on them.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Hawley H.: If you could draw and had
some bright ideas you might do well in black-and-
white work....A. Boultwood: The whatyoumaycallit
(it is perhaps meant for a picture) is of no use to us
.. . . Kangatong: A poor, barren, futile trifle. The
motorist is at least working, which the cigarette
fiend, who is jesting at his expense, isn’t... .D.L.H.:
Your sea-sickness picture is rotten, coarse and utterlv
disgusting. Besides, it isn’t a picture. And your
joke (which isn’t a joke) has been worked off by
aldermen and beadles and Bumbles and churchward-
ens and other bright intellects ever since the first pun
was invented P. J. Iloctor: No writing attached
to show what the pictures are about. Does that
mean that they are about nothing? They look about
the species of pictures that might be about something
of the sort. .. . J.D.C.: When you draw two loafers
at a bar you really ought to make one loafer say
something sparkling to the other. For two loafers
at a bar have been drawn so often. .. .Allan H.:
“Bank _ director” joke rejected, but not returned."
You might pass the aged jest on some other paper,
and get into gaol. People like you don’t seem to
realise that when you sell old literary matter with-
out intimating that it is old you are getting money
by false pretences, just as much as if you passed a
valueless cheque, and it is only the forbearance of
editors and the like which keeps you out of The “jug.”
..N.A. _ (V.): Your delight in mere distor-
tion is infantile. Look at Phil May’s series
“Things We See When We Come Out Without
Our Gun.” He got his humorous effects by skilful
exaggeration W.S. (W.A.) : Wash covers a multi-
tude of artistic sins. The end of the artist’s sleeve
(or perhaps it is the end of the critic’s sleeve) is
apparently woven into the body of his coat, and his
trousers are back to front. The alleged jest is point-
less, and neither of the characters looks the sort
of man who would say “Spare me day5.”....18 •
What is the precise use of a jokeless drawing of two
beautiful full-bosomed ladies in evening dress stand-
ing opposite each other and looking up in the air ?
Work is prettily feminine and quite colorless.

this connection a Victorian Supreme Court
Judge could tell a tale. On his promotion
he received a letter from a solicitor, who
had employed him on the very day of his
advancement, pointing out that his client
was an exceedingly poor man. Could the
new Judge see his way, etc., etc.? The
Judge replied in a letter redolent of sym-
pathy, but protesting that he dared not
commit such a breach of professional eti-
quette, much as his feelings, etc. “I knew
what your feelings in the matter would be,”
replied the solicitor, “and in order to allow
you to satisfy your sense of justice without
offending professional etiquette by returning
a fee, I had payment of the cheque stopped
before I wrote you.”


Rapidly Grew Worse, Could Not
Sleep. Scratched Until Little
Body Bled. Completely Cured,
Thanks to Cuticura Remedies.
28 Jarvie St., E. Brunswick, Vic. —“When
my little girl was ten months old her skin
became affected. Tiny red spots appeared
ri\ N
all over the body and in
spite of various treatments
rapidly grew worse until
the spots were nearly the
size of a shilling. She was
very cross and could not
sleep of nights and used
to scratch herself until her
little body bled. This
continued for over two
months and wo were at our wit’s end what
to do to ease her. The complaint puzzled
my elderly relatives and friends, and my
chemist recommended me one thing after
another, without success.
“ Some time ago I determined to give the
Cuticura Remedies a trial. After two or
three applications of the Cuticura Oint-
ment I noticed the, skin looked more soft
and less inflamed and at the end of three
weeks the spots had completely disappeared,
leaving the skin beautifully soft and clear,
and I now can say she is completely cured,
thanks to the wonderful Cuticura Reme-
dies.” (Signed) Mrs. E. Holmes, Oct. 3, ’l2.
It costs nothing to learn how effective
and satisfying Cuticura Soap and Ointment
are in treating poor complexions, red, rough
hands, itching scalps, dandruff, dry, thin
and falling hair, because you need not buy
them until you try them. A single set is
often sufficient. Although sold throughout
the world a liberal sample of each will be
mailed free with 32-p. Skin Book. Address

TIONS. If you have HAD NO SUCCESS WITH OTHERS, please write to

SENTED—A TRUE HAIR GROWER. It is always prepared in accordance
with the formula with which my name has become famous, and which is

THE HAIR BEGINS TO GROW, AND CONTINUES UNTIL A HEALTH ,
STRONG, PERMANENT GROWTH IS MANIFEST.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff, baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well
the humiliation that they cause. There is no need, however, of such conditions. These troubles c
be quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.

The cat’s-meat man has arrived in Sydney. For
many years he was an unknown institution, but
times change. So does meat. So do cats. In brighter,
younger days the pussy foraged for herself, but now
the city has grown so big that she has to travel 10
miles or so before she can run riot and caterwaul on
a gum tree, and she has almost forgotten what a gum
tree is like. Then, again, there was a time when
any old meat was the cat’s meat. Now, owing to
railway congestion, the Sydney-bound bullock is
liable to do a seven-days perish in the trucks with-
out water, and when it gets out, a fever-stricken
ghost, and is driven howling to the abattoirs, it isn’t
fit for any cat to eat. Also it is crazy enough to
eat any cat or any number of cats. So, by reason
of a number of circumstances, the Sydney feline
finds itself placed on a new basis. It has lost its
summer vacation in the bush, for the adjacent bush
is dead. There is no longer enough rat and mouse
to go round. The habit of having covers on milk
cans has cut off an old-established means of suste-
nance. So has the habit of having covers on garbage-
tins. The shingle roof, to which a cat could cling
easily, has given place to a slippery galvanised-iron
abomination, so the invigorating midnight promenade
is at an end. And the infant who carries the animal
round by the tail has increased just at a time when
the animal was least fitted to stand being carried
round by the tail. Something had to be done for
the cat, else it would have deserted the sinking ship
of civilisation.

“Asbestos”: In his oration on Australian boots,
“0.K.” hits the nail on the head when he states (B.
29/l/’l4) that “the prejudice is accounted for nowa-
days firstly by the fact that most Australian boots
are not branded.” The same applies to felt hats and
many other items that are creditably manufactured
locally. The blame lies with the wholesale ware-
houseman. He will not allow the manufacturer to
stamp “Made in Australia” on the articles he buys
and distributes, but insists that they be branded
with his own warehouse trade-mark, which usually
consists of a raging lion or something equally un-
Australian. Consequently the public purchases Aus-
tralian goods believing them to be either British or
foreign, according to the way the trade-mark im-
presses the buyer’s fancy. The Commerce Act
rightly insists on all imported articles being branded
with the name of the country of origin, and this
gives the “made in Germany” mob a splendid ad-
vertisement. But, unfortunately, the Act stops there,
instead of also demanding that “made in Australia”
be stamped on the local products, so as to give the
same publicity to our own manufactures. Most man-
ufacturers wish to mark their goods “Made in Aus-
tralia,” but they are not individually strong
enough to risk displeasing the unpatriotic merchant
who is often their only customer. They probably
n :er will be able to obtain their rights in this
n iter until the Commerce Act is altered to compel
the Australian to do what the foreigner now so very
willingly does.
* * * »
“Coorey”: “Pick” (B. 29/l/’l4) produces a
bushel of misstatements re timber matters, which
would be all right if he didn’t attribute them to me.
Let me assure “Pick” that I did not even mention
the Forestry officials. Theirs is a different sphere
altogether from the timber inspector’s. The former
deals with the raw material, the latter with the
finished or partly-finished product of the bush. The
difference is that between the squatter and the cat’s-
meat salesman. The Departments of Works, Mines,
Agriculture, Telegraphs, Railways, etc., each have
their inspectorial staff, arid it was two of these I
had in mind when I stated (what I now repeat)
that the substitution of inferior and other timbers
for the specified material, is permitted. “Pick” asks
the cause, whether fraud, negligence ■or incapacity.
I dispense with the first, and in some cases acknow-
ledge the next two. Yet again there is another cause
which he does not seem to be aware of —a little tact.
In the wonderful examination set for admission to
the guardianship of the Bush, a pass constitutes in
the clerical part not less than 50 per cent, on any
one paper, nor less than 60 per cent, in the aggre-
gate. In addition, there is a practical test of but
little better percentage, but the thing which bumps
out so many budding foresters, even after they have
passed all the rest, is called by the Public Service
Board “failed in aptitude,” which is another way
of saying “want of tact.” At present, there are 21
candidates eligible for appointment, and I take it
that the one who exhibits the greatest tact, how-
ever expressed, has the brightest chance of the first
leg up the gum-tree.

Harassed by the high cost of living, even the safe-
breaker is calling out for labor-saving devices. A
couple of him broke into a Sydney boot-polish factory
a few nights back, went through all the drawers,
made an attempt at the safe, and got the large sum
of nothing. Next morning, when the boss came to
work he found a typed note on his desk: “Why didn’t
you leave the safe open, you ?” But they lacked
business training, and didn’t leave any address for
the reply to be sent to.

“J. 0.8.”: “Torrens’ title, Torrens’ title,” repeated
the land and estate agent. - “Who is this Torrens?”
asked the prospective buyer of the lithographed
allotment. The land and estate agent appeared
never to have been asked the question before, but
bri*'g p U t to it he pumped up the information that
Torrens’ title chokes off lawyers and is “as sound
as the Bank of England.” Poor old Torrens! He had
hard work getting Australia to understand his idea,
and particularly hard work in keeping solicitors at
bay while he was converting Parliament. He was a
County Cork man, Collector of Customs in Adelaide,
and then member of Parliament. He had but one
use for his shillelagh—to fight with it for his system
of land transfer. The old plan of relying wholly on
deeds fed lawyers, who had often to go back through
half a ton of transfers to see that the title was com-
plete. Torrens advocated registration in a book
kept by the Government as not only simpler, but in
comparison almost costless. When he had converted
the S.A. Parliament he travelled round Australia
expounding his Act and fighting lawyers in every capi-
tal. Actually he single-handed conquered Australia,
and when he left for England every Australian Par-
liament sent him its thanks for his achievement.
He became a member of the House of Commons and
introduced his bill there; but members were more
under the thumb of law, and gave him but half an
ear.
ON THE BUST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Oh, yes! You can get them for two-and-eleven-
pence at Rags Ltd!”— Terrible revelation by a lady.
To lay his head upon her breast
He thinks would be like Heaven.
Ah, there indeed he longs to rest
Upon that shapely, swelling breast
That cost Two-and-Eleven.
(I trust, dear friends, you’ll not divulge
The secret of that lovely bulge!)
It fills her blouse to such effect
That all men watch her keenly.
As she sweeps by in muslin decked,
Your peace of mind is straightway wrecked.
Like some young queen serenely,
Full-bosomed on her way she goes.
(Only the crafty draper knows!)
It’s business —and it’s Art as , well.
The youth so sentimental
Admires the curves that softly swell.
It is a sweet and lovely sell
That Nature in her gentle
Old way will supersede when she
Has taken on maternity.
Two-and-l'.leven buys the bust
That draws Man’s admiration !
No perfect gentleman, I trust —
(I speak, remember, of the bust)
Will curse the innovation!
It may be false —it may be true!
Don’t worry! All are good to view.

TWO FAVORITES—
Gwen Burroughs and Rexona
January Bth, 1914.
Rexona Proprietary Company,
SYDNEY.
Dear Sirs, —
You have heard I have
been using Rexona and Rexona
Soap. This is quite true, and I
want to tell you what I think of
them. They are both simply
excellent. ,1 always keep a pot
of Rexona on my dressing-table,
and consider it simply indispen-
sable. I always use it after
Surfing, and find it simply
splendid for Sunburn, and for
preserving the skin.
As for Rexona Soap it is won-
derful how lovely it makes the
hair, so soft and silky, and it is
so refreshing. I think every
girl should use Rexona Soap,
and I am sure I shall never miss
an ooportunity of recommend-
ing both Rexona and Rexona
Soap.
Yours sincerely,
(S*d.) GWEN DAY BURROUGHS.

“How are you
feeding him ?”
Next to maternal
milk, nothing is so
good for feeding babies
as Albulactin with diluted
cow’s milk.
For Albulactin is simply the
vital nutritive and digestive
element which is so abundant
in maternal milk—and so lamentably deficient in cow’s milk
and other foods.
Write to-day for a Free Baby-book.
Therefore, babies digest this
mixture arid thrive on it as per-
fectly as if they were breast fed.
Lady Howard de Walden —
mother of “ the richest twins in
the world’’—writes : “The twins
are being fed on Albulactin, arid it
suits them very well.”

The Double-bed Dialogues.
THE FIRST JEALOUSY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was in the first few months of my
miraculous marriage with Babette the
beauteous. Naturally I was proud of
Babette, though in those days, per-
haps, I considered her merely as a
piece of perfect statuary, of which,
by incredible good luck, I had acquired
possession. My marriage with her had
been like walking into an auction sale
and picking up for a trifle a genuine Manet.
1 liked taking her out; I liked her to dress
smartly; I hated her in the neutral colors
that she so instinctively knew were the
finest frame for her brilliant beauty. For
myself, I would have clothed her in a rain-
bow. _
I liked seeing other women shoot at her
that professional, all-comprehending glance
that absorbs in one instant every feature
and every curve, every tone and every detail
oj a beautiful woman and her attire. I had
seen Babette use that professional glance at
other women. One passing look at a woman
seen on the street, and Babette knew whether
that woman used lip-salve, whether she pen-
cilled her eyebrows, whether she padded, or
by what make of corset she contrived to
stow away (and where she contrived to stow
away) the excess of her superabundant
figure, how much she paid for that corset, at
what shop she got it and at which particular
•sale, whether her lace was hand-made or
imitation, whether her stockings were all
silk or had lisle feet and lisle tops, whether
she possessed six pairs of shoes or only two,
whether she was married, and, if so, what
income her husband possessed; and, particu-
larly, whether under any conceivable cir-
cumstances she might become dangerous. The
sole danger she feared, except, of course, the
horror every woman has that she might some
day Fok her age, was that Some Other
unman, might capture me from her. And in
flabette’s honeymoon every attractive woman
was that contingent Some Other Cat. Babette
had had considerable experience of her sex.
But not only was I proud if women scru-
tinised my wife, but I really liked men to
admire her. Their admiration was not
needed to convince me that I had acquired
something really valuable, but it served to
remind me. It was comforting to find that
jpy own opinion was so universally con-
firmed. I might have become jealous if
Babette had not alwavs returned their preda-
tory gaze with one that went clean through
looni, serenely unconscious of their existence,
that was before the night at the theatre.
»e had gone on an impulse, for I had
already found that Babette adored impulses.
'' n e n I booked seats days ahead, Babette
was pleased; but when at dinner I remarked,
suppose we go and see this new show at
the Criterion?” she was delighted. On this
night, however, we were unable to get seats
in the stalls, and had to content ourselves
with a place at the corner of the dress circle,
a front seat, with the seats raised in tiers
behind us.
About the middle of the first act I became
conscious that there were two men just
behind us—they had come in after the cur-
tain was up—and that their attention was
not wholly occupied by the stage. In fact,
hiost of it was concentrated on Babette’s
back.
Have I mentioned that Babette has a
beautiful back? During my engagement I
!n £ uesse d that it was charming, but during
the honeymoon I learnt that my guess had
been far short of the reality. Babette some-
how knew it, too, though I doubt if any man
in the world has ever examined his own
back in a mirror. And when she committed
'.i e <£ ross sacrilege of covering her back with
clothes, mercifully she spared as much
. J t as possible. And it was really
■fiiraculous how much of it was possible,
-twing, to the providential formation of a
v oman s figure, while there is a fixed point
ot low-water mark in front—though Babette
had long ago discovered that this really
depends on the make of your corset and the
shape of your dress; she varied between the
deceptive square and the daring “V” —on a
woman s back there is practically no limit,
egal or practical, as to the distance the tide
may fall.
this evening there was A Good
eal of Babette to be seen from behind. Of
•ourse, as soon as we took our seats, though
it wmter night, Babette instantly dis-
covered that it was too hot inside the theatre
p r , k ee P on her cloak. And when
t l at b ac k’ though her chair obscured
_,° her back, still, seen over her bare
ers an( * from above—the seating
eVm a^B^v en i S i! seeme d specially designed by
for ,, this scenic effect —there was
really Rather More of Babette than pre-
sumably even Babette cared to show. (She
had a bit of lace there, but it was very open-
work lace —ri-atlier like a piece of wire-net-
ting-. )
in the first interval Babette sat back, and
the two men leaned forward. Luckily my
wife was serenely unconscious of their in-
terest, and soon afterwards the two men went
out for a drink. I did not care to men-
tion so delicate a matter, since Babette, like
all her sex, is a prude. A woman will
deliberately disclose as much of her figure
as the by-laws allow —and some of the
by-laws are dreadfully out of date. She
will dispense with that article of attire
which her sex began to wear only two cen-
turies ago, but which the modern tight skirt
renders, in her opinion, superfluous; but if
she knew that when she stands between the
sunlight and the average unmarried man for
all the value her skirt is she might as well
be in bathing costume, she would be pain-
fully shocked. So she will deliberately
attiact the roving eye of the strange male
by cunningly disposed bebe-ribbons that
beckon beneath an openwork blouse ; yet if
she finds on returning home that a corset-
string has escaped a placquet hole, she weeps.
The principle a woman has formulated for
herself in these matters is that any male
may see any part of her, or of her attire,
that she means him to see, but if he sees
even the most innocent portion of her dress
that is not meant to be seen he is a Horrible
Brute. Thus if the adorable Babette learnt
that strange men could see more of her than
the absurdly liberal allowance she, out of
the fulness of her heart, gave them, she
would feel dreadfully immodest. And, curi-
ously enough, she would hate me for being
the innocent instrument for enlightening
her.
Since our marriage Babette had told me
of the Awful Catastrophe that had happened
to her in the middle of a crowded street
when an indispensable tape had broken,
and a strange woman had helped her
to the shelter of the nearest draper’s,
shop. Babette had felt no gratitude
to this unknown Samaritan, who had
prevented Babette from literally falling
by the wayside. On the contrary, she con-
fessed quite naturally that she hated that
woman, and would always hate her.
A strange man can accost any man and
inform him that he has a piece of fluff on
his shoulder, and quietly remove it for him;
and the fluffy man will be quite grateful. But
if one strange woman calls the attention of
another woman to the apparent fact that she
has forgotten, in the hurry of running for
the train, to button up the back of her blouse,
those women part enemies for life. If a
blundering man dared to even mention the
gaping fact he would be frozen with a stare.
As the two men made their way noisily
to their seats behind us, after having evi-
dently had more than one drink, Babette
gave them a fleeting glance, and quickly
dropped her eyes to her programme. Some-
thing had apparently disturbed her. The
orchestra was noisily busy, and around us
was the sustained hum of conversational
chatter, but through it all I heard the young
man behind who had the clearest view of
Babette’s shoulder remark :—-
“Bit of all right, eh?”
The other man cautiously laughed.
Luckily Babette had not heard, but shortly
afterwards she casually turned round in her
seat and glanced over the ro\»s of seats that
towered behind us. There was nothing in
her action that could fix on her any blame,
even to my jealous mind. I was sure that
she hadn’t heard —yet what man can tell
whether women do not possess an extra
sense, by means of which even the unspoken
and the unapparent admiration of any man
is subtly conveyed to them? Still, a wife
should not have turned round and stared in
that way.
I had hurriedly to make conversation with
Babette, to cover up any fuither remarks
made by those men behind. But my pre-
cautions were vain.
As the curtain ascended, I distinctly heard
the nearest man say to the other, “Bet you
I’ll make her turn round again!”
I saw red. Quickly I swung round in
my seat, but in the darkness saw only two
blurs of white where faces should have been.
What could I do? The man had evidently
had the one glass too many, and any protest
of mine would only lead to a scene. And
Babette would be the centre of that scene.
Miserably and impotently I turned again to
the stage.
A quick glance showed me that Babette
had not heard. Yet she was curiously rest-
less. In the semi-darkness I noticed her
fiddling with the little bit of indispensable
lace that had got stranded in the “V.” Still,
a Woman’s principal occupation is to fiddle
with her attire, to pat her hair, or send ex-
ploring fingers on voyages of discovery up
and down her back.
“Babette,” I whispered, “I want you to
do something for me, something important.”
“Important?” she said in surprise. “What
is it?”
“Don’t look round at those ihen behind
you again.” ,
Babette never moved. She had become a
piece of beautiful statuary. “What on earth
for?” she asked at last.
“Because I ask you,” I said, sternly.
“But,” she began, “1.... 1.... Why should
I want to look x-ound at those men? And
how do I know there are any men there?
And why shouldn’t I. if I like?”
“Simply because your husband asks you,
Babette.”
“But this is extraordinary,” she breath--,
lessly began. “I don’t know those men —if
there are men behind me. Henry, you must'
tell me why you don’t want me to do such an
ordinary thing.”
Whenever Babette calls me Hem-y I know
she is in earnest. She doesn’t often call me
Henry. She has her own name for me, but
that name will never appear in print. A
man has some dignity to keep up—even a
mari-ied man.
“I can’t possibly tell you now,” I wliis-
pei-ed back.
“Sux-ely!” Babette spoke hotly. “You
make a perfectly ridiculous request, without
the vestige of a reason. And you’ve simply
made me curious. I hadn’t the least desire >
to turn round before you spoke, but now I
simply must.”
“Listen to me.” I sternly said. “I can’t
tell you my x-eason here, but there is a
good reason. And if you don’t do as I tell
you, if you make the least attempt to turn
round, I’ll take you straight home. You

WOBN OUT with the miserable pains of Kidney Disease-
Backache, Headache, Dropsical Swellings, Dizziness,
Heart Attacks and Twinges of Rheumatism.
WORN OUT with the worries and cares of the children
and the home the constant stooping - about, and working from
morning till night. Is it any wonder that the kidneys break
down ?
WORN OUT—So much to do, so little strength to do it.
Every household task made a burden by the miserable pains
of kidney disease —
Lumbago, pains in the loins and back, heart attacks,
dizziness, nervous headache, rheumatism, gravel and urinary
disorders —
The swellings of dropsy, and that heavy, drowsy feeling
which makes you feel so slow and miserable.
But don’t grow disheartened. Neighbors tell here what
a comfort Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have been to them.
Doan’s Pills are for the kidneys ONLY. They relieve the
kidneys and bladder like laxative medicines relieve the bowels,
and dispose,, of the kidney poisons which are the cause of so
much suffering in men and women. Read this testimony
Sydney Women Cured.
Five Years Cured
Two Years Cured
Mrs. A. E. Bruce. “Omapere,”
Broughton Road, Artarmon, Sydney,
says:—“l suffered for a long time with
severe pains in my back. They were so
bad that I could scarcely move about.
Rest was out of the question. I wouid
be tossing about all night, moaning with
the pain. I could not bend my back, and
I had to neglect my work. I was really
very ill, and would be confined to bed for
days at a time. I saw Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills advertised as a cure fcr
backache, and procured a bottle. After
a few doses I got relief, and then gradu-
ally I got better, until I was quite cured.
This did not happen yesterday, but two
years ago, and I am still well.”
Five years later Mrs. Bruce says:—•
“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me of backache seven years ago, and I
have been free of this ailment ever since.”
Mrs. P. J. English, 120 A Phillip Street,
Sydney, says:—“About six years ago I
commenced to suffer with kidney disease;
at times I was so bad that I had to take
to my bed. I used plasters, etc., trying
for a cure, but nothing did me any good.
Hearing Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
spoken of as excellent for kidney trouble
led me to try them. They completely
cured me, and during the past three years
I have been perfectly well. I can sin-
cerely recommend other sufferers to use
them.”
Two years later Mrs. English confirms
her previous statement .-—“Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills cured me of kidney
trouble over five years ago, and I have
been well ever since. I have recom-
mended this remedy to scores of people,
and they all speak well of them.”
Doans Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at

PILES
A Lasting Cure by
DOAN'S OINTMENT.
Mrs. 0. King, 47 Marlborough Street, Surry Hills, says:—“About three years
ago I had a very severe attack of Piles, and suffered intense agony. I used a great
number of Pile remedies, but they were useless in my case. I heard of a cure effected
by Doan’s Ointment, and decided to give it a trial. The soothing and healing effects
of this Ointment are marvellous. A few applications gave me ease, and a short
treatment quite cured me, and I have not been troubled with Piles since. I think
the world of Doan’s Ointment, and advise all sufferers to give it a trial.”
Two years later Mrs. King says:—“l am pleased to bring the above statement
up to date by telling you I am still free of Piles, and have been even since Doan’s
Ointment cured me nearly five years ago. My lasting cure proves that this remedy
cures to stay cured.”
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2/9 per poti
or post free by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
must trust me, Babette, dear. I’m your hus-
band, and it is for your own sake that I am
speaking. And I mean it.”
It was the first time that Babette had seen
her husband in me. So far, she had consid-
ered me as a rather delightful child, to be
cajoled and humored. It took her some
minutes to absorb the shock. When she
spoke it was in a sobered mood. “Very
well, husband,” she said. “Of course, I
know the whole thing is absurd on your
part, but I’ll be a good little girl since you
tell me to so sternly,”
And her hand stole into mine and gave it
a delightful squeeze,
“Thanks,” I said.
But as I bent to her I looked down the
white slope of her bosom and noticed that
the rag of lace had disappeared. Since I had
assisted her in fixing her corset that evening
I knew that the lace, whose function was
to disguise—or was it to emphasise?—the
“V,” could not have slipped down. There
was nowhere for it to slip to, since all below
the “V” was Babette, corset and bosom.
“Why, Babette,” I whispered, “what’s
become of that bit of lace?”
“Oh,” she airily answered, “I took it out.
I felt so hot. Wouldn’t you think that on
a night like this the theatre would be better
ventilated?”
What could I say? AVhat was there to
be said? But all the rest of that evening
I was miserably wondering whom it was
that I had married. Only the next day did
I discover that I had married —a woman.
As soon as the curtain fell, I hurried the
bareness of Babette into her cloak, and
rushed her out. She made not the slightest
attempt to look round. She kent her eyes
down. On the street she looked up to me
for my explanation, but I shook my head.
The explanation could not come then and
there. And when we got home Babette de-
liberately sulked. She sulks adorably. I
had to remind myself that I was angry with
her, else I couldn’t have refrained from
kissing her. And I had the feeling that to
kiss her then would be about as much use as
Moses striking the wrong rock.
In silence I untied and unpinned her, and
in silence I sucked my pricked finger.
But when we got to bed I told her what
that man had said.
“No!” she hotly protested. “That man
couldn’t have said a thing like that.”
“But I distinctly heard him. So did his
friend.”
Babette considered. “And he looked such
a _ nice man, too. So clean-looking, and
with such interesting eyes. And now all
the romance has gone out of it. I liked
him. I liked him to look at me.... but to
make a vulgar bet about me! It makes me
feel so—so cheap !”
“Exactly,” I sternly said.
u “Still,” she went on more cheerfully,
“though he was so common, he did admire
me. And I liked that. I could feel his ad-
miration all the time through my shoulders.”
“There wasn’t much on them to prevent
it,” I said.
“But surely,” she asked open-eyed, “you
like me I o look smart ?”
I was beginning to wonder whether I did
like it. “Not for the amusement of bound-
ers,” I replied.
“But how can I help people, even bounders,
admiring me, if I look pretty?” Babette
said with pathos.
“By not letting them see that you like it.
By not encouraging them, and by keeping
that piece of lace in the place where it be-
longed.”
“Oh!” Babette was hurt. “You really
think that I. could be so—so animal —as to
take that piece of lace out for —for that
man?”
‘‘Well, whom did you take it out for?”
“It was just a stupid impulse, Henry. I
felt so hot, and that theatre really should be
better ventilated, shouldn’t it?”
With this, Babette turned on me the back
that had caused all the trouble. And I
felt furiously jealous of every created male.
That beautiful back was my private propr. ■
erty, and Babette was calmly allowing per-'
feet strangers to inspect the premises.
“But, Babette,” I cried, “don’t you know
I love you? I know you didn’t deliberately
encourage that man; but I suppose you can’t
help encouraging any man. But that bit of
lace that went missing! That was delib-
erate. And though I love you—oh, more
than ever! —how can I ever again respect
you?”
“Henry!” she almost sobbed, “if you can
say such things, if you can think that of
I. . . .1 shall tell mother !”
She hunched herself, patted the pillow,
pulled up the bed-clothes so that a thick
ridge of wool intervened between the nearest
adjacent portions of Babette and me, and
snuggled down, like a curled kitten, to sleep.
But she did not sleep —for hours. So we
lay there, silent, pretending to breathe regu-
larly, in the darkness that had so heavily
descended upon our happiness.
When I woke in the morning I sleepily
turned to wake Babette with the “Good
morning” kiss. But she was not in bed.
Then I remembered. I saw her figure, in its
nightie, bending over her dressing-table.
Some instinct prompted me not to stir. I
felt intensely curious to know what she was
doing at her dressing-table.
In my effort to see I must have made a
noise, for she swiftly turned and saw me.
She_ started. In her hand I distinctly saw
a piece of letter paper. The next moment
she had turned her back to me; and though
there is considerable width in Babette’s back,
I knew that she was making a quick attempt
to conceal something. I sprang from the
bed, but before I reached her she had shut
the top drawer of her dressing-table and
defiantly faced me.
“What are you doing here?” I cried.
(i “Just looking at my nose,” she replied.
“Don’t you think it’s the teeniest bit red?”
The damnable suspicion that had seized
me turned to an equally damnable certainty.
“What was it you shut in that drawer?
You’re hiding a letter!”
“Oh, you saw, did you?” she quietly said,
one hand holding the drawer shut.
“Whose letter?” I hotly demanded. All
the foolishness of last night was nothing to
this dreadful proof of her guilt. That my
wife, that Babette, could have a letter that
she did not want me to see!
“Mine, you stupid.”
“Who sent it?”
“It hasn’t been sent.”
“You mean that it didn’t come through
the post?”
No,’ she actually laughed. It seemed to
sae was almost enjoying herself.
Who gave it to you?”
All Babette gave me was a look of raillery
and a happy “Ah !”
.“That man last night!” I exploded. “I
might have guessed. He slipped a note into
your hand!”
Babette brazenly laughed outright. “No,
dear, she chuckled, “not into my hand.
How could he, sitting behind me like that?
But....there was all my back.”
I shivered. “You mean to say that he
slipped it down your back?”
Well, wouldn’t it be the most convenient
post office?
I was maddened. “Babette,” I stormed,
give me that letter this instant.”
“Oh, no, I really couldn’t. Didn’t I tell
you that it was mine?”
“Then I’ll take it.”
Babette faced me—a new, utterly incom-
prehensible Babette. I paused stupidly to
think that this new being was the wife I
had married. And I was smitten with a
sudden fear —not fear for myself, but for
my marriage. If I took that letter by main
force from the drawer, then I certainly knew
something that held us together would
break. It might be but a minor strand of
the cord that held us, but the weakness
would always be there. I didn’t dare.
“You shan’t!” She defied me, she, so
rounded, so small, so childish, so weak—yet
so strong.
“No,” I said, when that moment of fierce
tension was over, “you will show it to me
yourself.”
To my confusion she replied, “Yes, of
course, but, please, not now.”
“Babette,” I said at length, “I trust you.
Good God, Babette, I must trust you—else
what would there be left of our marriage?
If you’ve done wrong, I can forgive you.
I must forgive you ! But I trust you. I
shan’t look in that drawer —you can leave
it open—but I know that you will show me
that letter.”
“Haven’t I said so?” she smiled. “But
not now. I must go to my bath.” She left
the dressing-table to don her bath robe. “By
the way, dear, the drawer is not locked. But
I know you will not open it.”
If Babette could do a foolish thing, she
could also do a splendid one. She could
leave a jealous husband alone in a room
with the proofs of her infidelity—oh, only
of thought!—under his hand, and yet she
knew that she could depend on my word
not to look at them.
“Babette,” I said, as she paused at the
door, “whatever you have done is wiped out
by the great trust you have in me. You can
leave that drawer unlocked”
“Why shouldn’t I?” she strangely smiled.
Because the letter isn’t there!”
I waited, miserable, for Babette’s return.
Her magnificence had dwindled until now I
saw her a carelessly impenitent sinner. This
adorable wife of mine was also adorable to
other men. Yet her transgression could
surely have been only a tiny one; and I
felt, in that melting mood that comes after
every quarrel that she had only to make
her pitiable confession and I would forgive
her. Honeymoon husbands are like that.
That is why so many marriages survive the
honeymoon.
Babette came running back, glowing in
her bath robe. “Ooh!” she shivered, “the
shower was cold! Hadn’t you better hurry?
We’ll be late for breakfast.”
I went to the bathroom and stepped under
the shower. As I put my hand up to turn
on the water I saw tied to the tap with a
piece of tape a folded note. ■ On it was
hurriedly pencilled, “The Fatal Letter!”
In the bath I read it.
There are no reticences in married life,
but there are reticences about married life.
So the reader will pardon the husband rf
he gives but the gist of Babette’s letter. To
me she had a frankness of phrase that was
nearly as naked as I then was.
She had been right when she claimed the
letter as hers. For she had written it her-
self as soon as she woke that morning, and
I had detected, her just as she had finished
it. I had evidently prevented her conceal-
ing it in the drawer. All the time we bad
stood facing each other she had it and her
pencil hidden in her hand—at which, of
course, I had never thought of looking.
And her letter was a full confession. She
admitted that she must have encouraged that
man by her eyes. (And I admit that
Babette’s eyes are the sort that would en-
courage any man.) And she admitted hav-
ing removed the lace, and not because of the
lack of fresh air in the theatre. But when
it came to explaining why, she honestly
could not tell. It was an impulse, a piece
of pure mischief she didn’t know how
or why. And she had been sorry the mo-
ment after, and if I hadn’t spoken to her
about it, she would have shoved it back at
once. But when I blamed her. she simply
had to brazen it out. Because then she
knew that I could be dreadfully jealous of
her—and that was a thing that she bad long
worried herself over. For if I couldn’t be
jealous, then I couldn’t reallv love her. And
it was so delightful to feel that I was iealous
that she simply had to keep it up. But all
the way home she knew that she had bpen a
silly, naughty, child, and if I had just given
her a good slapning she would have boon as
good as gold. But when I had told her of
that beast’s nasty bet she felt so indignant
with me —she had to be indignant with some:
body and I was the nearest person to vent
it on—that she simply had to sulk. But oh,
how she loved her big, stern, jealous hus-
band ! And if he had only kissed her rood
and hard that night she had been prepared to
be so penitent and meek. And long before
she had gone to sleep she had forgiven him.
She couldn’t have gone to sleep until she
did.
And when he had caught her writing the
letter—this was the postscript she had
scribbled in the bathroom —she was so
thrilled by my furious jealousy that she had
to keep it up. Because it showed her that
I madly loved her. No husband is a hus-
band unless he is ready to be jealous at the
slightest thing. And now she was waiting to
be forgiven. She wouldn’t begin to dress
until she had been completely forgiven....
The letter ended: “Now, darling, turn on
the cold shower— quick!”

IT IS A WISE PRECAUTION
to take the greatest care of your health. In order to do this
effectually it is necessary from time to time to take a few doses
of the right medicine —one that will regulate and tone up the
digestive system. There ought to be no difficulty in deciding
what that is. The verdict in favour of Beecham’s Pills is
overwhelming. Many people find it an excellent plan
TO TAKE
them periodically. They are the remedy, par excellence, for
cleansing the system from impurities and ensuring a correct and
regular action of the important organs of digestion, assimilation,
and execretion. Vigour of body and mind, are the portion only
of the healthy. Remember, then, that health may be established
and maintained by the use of that old and well-tried remedy—
