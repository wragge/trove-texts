“the BANJOES” BOOK.
The Bulletin is proud of its “ Banjo ” in
Angus and Robertson’s admirable dress —a
close imitation of Methuen’s original edition
of Kipling’s “ Barrack-Room Ballads.’
Hitherto, Australian authors have mostly
had to die before their typographical luck set
in : the new era is indeed welcome. And
as the publishers have Lawson and Daley in
hand for similar treatment, and other poets
and prosers will doubtless come along, it
looks as if a library of Australian authors,
printed in Australia, may some day be no
idle dream.
But since “Barrack-Room Ballads and
Other Verses” was taken as a typographical
model, it might possibly have been better to
take a hint from the title as well. ‘ ‘ Bush
Ballads and Other Verses ” sounds better
than “ The Man from Snowy River and
Other Verses,” and Gordon’s lien isn’t
absolute. “Gordon’s Poems” has swallowed
up “ Bush Ballads and Galloping Rhymes ”
for the public eye and the reader’s ear; and,
if a title should be descriptive, “Bush
Ballads” are the title for “The Banjo’s'
verses (“ A. B. Paterson ” sounds strange,
though one may get used to it in time).
The author has preferred to hint at his own
personality rather than at the character of
his verse ; and—it really doesn’t matter.
Yet it is always as a bush balladist that
one thinks of “ Banjo.” In “Rolf Boldre-
wood’s ” preface (The Bulletin doesn't con-
sider any Australian book improved by
“Rolf Boldrewood’s ” preface since Louis
Becke’s “Modern Buccaneer” was published
—“by Rolf Boldrewood ”), he says that the
collection “ comprises the best bush ballads
written since the death of Lindsay Gordon.”
The reference might be misleading to those
who do not know the books. Gordon,
indeed, called some of his verses “Bush
Ballads,” but (quite unheeding the matter of
form) there is hardly a hint of the ballad
spirit in any of them. If our true balladist
is no introspective pessimist ; and then Gor-
don had too much “culture,” too many of
the rhymester’s airs and graces, ever to be
natural—and a “ballad” which does not
spring spontaneously from the soul has no
right to the title.
The essence of the ballad is simplicity,
and simplicity is the last thing Gordon
dreamt of achieving. When he is natural,
it is because he has written too lazily or too
hurriedly to be artful; all his efforts are in
the direction of elaboration. Take the dedica-
tion to the “Bash Ballads” themselves—
perhaps the prettiest bit of verse Gordon
wrote. His songs, he said, came —
In the deep’ning of dawn, when it dapples
The dusk of the sky
With streaks like the reld’ning of apples
The ripening of rye ;
To eastward when, cluster by cluster.
Dim stars and dull planets that muster
Wax wan in a world of white lustre
That floods far and high.
What balladist ever compassed such al-
literative effects -or strove for them ? And
how much does alliteration bother “ The
Banjo ” 1
“The Banjo” is just the ordinary bush
bard sublimated —raised to the «th power,
as it were. He is not akin to the bush
“ poet,” for his work is not, and does not
profess to be, all poetry, though it is some-
times highly poetic, when (as in “Kiley’s
Run ”) the subject suggests pathos. But
“The Banjo’s” sense of pathos is no more
than any healthy male may possess without
feeling his appetite a bit the worse—no more
than any average bushman has when he
comes across a deserted selection, or
his girl of yore who married somebody
else. With such an invitation nine
bushmen out of ten will sit down, if they are
hy themselves, to compose doggerel which
they call “poetry.” But it isn’t poetry.
Poetry is generally more or less of an un-
healthy growth, a morbid secretion; and
doesn’t come naturally to the man who
thinks nothing of riding 70 or 80 miles, or
shearing seven or eight score sheep, every
day for a week together. That man doesn’t
write poetry ; his liver is too good ; but if he
is in the mood, and has a reading turn, he
may compose very decent verse.
“ The Banjo’s ” verse is more than decent :
it is good, and is strongly leavened with the
divine gift of humor. It isn’t very deep,
and the deeper it aims at being the less it
succeeds ; but it is stirring, manly stuff,
which rejoices one to read and remember.
Mr. Paterson, indeed, Jike the old Cavalier
lyrists, is able to combine the power to do
and the power to write. Wolfe could only
take Quebec, he couldn’t write Gray’s
“ Elegy ” ; but “ The Banjo ” rides and wins
his steeplechases, and then, one may believe,
sits down with a still tingling pulse and con-
veys the tingle to the pulses of his readers.
though his horse-poems, such as the
splendid “ Old Pardon,” may please most
readers, he is perhaps at his best when,
without too obvious labor, he touches the
humorous or sentimental side of some com-
monplace bush scene or incident, as in “The
Two Devines,” or the first part of “Kiley’s
Run,’’ or a dozen other pieces in his new
volume. He is at his worst in pieces like
“Lost’’and “Only a Jockey,” and one or
two others injudiciously admitted. He has
some verbal faults and a few lines of which
the “merits indeed are but slight ” (as he
says in the weak prelude whose place should
have been taken by “Daylight is Dying”).
But withal he is “The Banjo,” of whose
verse every Australian already knows at
least some snatches, and we love him.
The book, which, it is easy to predict,
will have a great and permanent sale, does
exceeding credit to the printers, Websdale,
Shoosraith and Cos., of Sydney.
SOME RECENT BOOKS.
Edward Jenks (once law-professor at Melb.
University) in his recently-published “His-
tory of the Australasian [Colonies ” (“ The
History” he calls it), only “believes”
“ payment of members ” is in force in Aus-
tralasia. He ignores the financial crisis of
’93 (probably because there are no handy
authorities like Blair and Rusdeu to dish
up) ; and, while mentioning a number of
nonentities as prominent politicians, he dis-
cards men like Service, Vogel, Parkes,
Dailey, and others. Jenks says there is no
originality in Australian politics, and on the
next page remarks that experience has
ripened originality. The Saturday Review,
which notes most of these things and some
others similar, characterises the book as
slovenly—to which English adjective, for
Australian purposes, the great Australian
adjective may advantageously be prefixed.
“The Pocket Guide to Cycling” (Is. 3d.),
though written for English readers, has
sufficient hints of all-round applicability to
make it useful to Australasian cyclists.
“I never had a spark of imagination,”
says the supposed writer of Conan Doyle’s
“Stark-Munro Letters” (35., 45.). Inten-
tionally or not, the line fits Doyle himself
truly. His new book is very solid and
Scottish, in the style of “ Round the Red
Lamp,” with hardly as much interest as that
set of stories, but with more than enough to
be well worth reading. It has become quite
clear, however, that Doyle will never make
literature ; his new book rises only to the
rank of careful journalism, with a good deal
of diary-transcription, a little pithy philo-
sophy, and some rhetorical effects labori-
ously worked up. But not an atom
of fancy. There is a suggestion of
“ Breakfast-Table ” methods in the aphor-
isms, impressions, and instances, and Doyle
should have credit for the remarks on dog-
matic religion—British readers being apt to
punish authors who interfere with their con-
ventional beliefs. Here is a good sample of
the clever and conscientious stuff with which
“ The Stark-Munro Letters.” are filled. A
smart doctor is initiating a tyro in his busi-
ness methods.
“There are one or two elementary rules to be
observed in the way of handling patients,” he re-
marked, seating himself on the table and swinging.
“ The most obvious is that you must never let
them see that you want them. It should be pure
condescension on your part seeing them at all;
and the more difficulties you throw in the way of
it, the more they think of you. Break your patients
in early, and keep them well to heel. Never make
the fatal mistake of being polite to them. Many
foolish young men fall into this habit, and are
ruined in consequence. Now, this is my form.”
He sprang to the door, and, putting his two hands
to his mouth, he bellowed: “Stop your con-
founded jabbering down there ! I might as well
be living above a poultry show ! There, you see,”
he added to me, “they will think ever so much
more of me for that.”
“ But don’t they get offended ? ” I asked.
“ I’m afraid not. I have a name for this sort
of thing now, and they have come to expect it.
But an offended patient—l mean a thoroughly
insulted one —is the lirest advertisement in the
world. If it is a woman, she runs clacking about
among her friends until your name becomes a
household word, and they all pretend to sympa-
thise with her, and agree among themselves that
you must be a remarkably discerning man. I
quarrelled with one man about the state of his
gall duct, and it ended by my throwing him down
the stairs. What was the result ? He talked so
much about it that the whole village from which
he came, sick and well, trooped to see me. The
little country practitioner who had been buttering
them lip for a quarter of a centu y found i bat he
might as well put up his shutters. It s human
nature, my boy, and you can’t alter it. Eh, what 2
Y ou make yourself cheap and you become cheap.
You put a high price on yourself and
they rate you at that price. Suppose I
set" up in Harley-street to-morrow, and
made it all nice and easy, with hours
from ten to three, do you thin . I should get a
patient 2 1 might starve first. How would I
work it 2 I should lot it be known, that I only
saw patients frdm midnight until two in the
morning, and that bald-headed people must pay
double. That would set people talking, their
curiosity would be stimulated, and in four months
the streets would be blocked all night. Eh, what ?
laddie, you’d go yourself. That’s my principle
here. I often come in of a morning and send
them all about their business, tell them I’m going
off to the country for a day. I turn away forty
pounds, and it’s worth four hundred as an adver-
tisement ! ”
NOTES.
Perhaps of all literary Australians H. B.
Marriott Watson has “ arrived ” furthest.
His recent appointment to the co-editorship
of the Saturday Review is a blue ribbon
the like of which no other of our prosers has
achieve ! at 30 ; and Mr. Watson’s fine talent
has not yet found its limits. lie is a native
of Melbourne ; and his father, the Rev. H. C.
Marriott Watson (now of St. John’s Church,
Christchurch, M.L.), is also Australian-born
of parents Australian-born, and a writer of
no mean repute.
When The Bulletin in a recent issue
labelled Alex. Montgomery “ Scottish,” it
did unintentionally “another injustice to
Ireland,” where (in the North) the Bornean
story-teller came to light in ’47. Yet his
family is that Franco-Scottish one which con-
tributed General Ralph Montgomery to the
cause of American independence; so in
essence, maybe, the label was deserved. In-
tended originally for the diplomatic service
(Mr. Montgomery alleges he had special dis-
qualifications for the diplomatic service), a
taste for adventure sent him surreptitiously
to salt-water. He was fascinated by
. . . the black wharves and the slips,
And the sea-tides tossing free ;
And Spanish sailors with bearded lips,
And the beauty and mystery of the ships,
And the magic of the sea.
Then came some rough experiences in the
North Atlantic trade, followed by a couple
of years spent in studying medicine ashore,
till the roving spirit sent him to the Medi-
terranean (where he was stabbed and run
down) and then to the East, where he
wandered in a scientific spirit over the
Malay Archipelago. Coming to Australia,
he added a few bush experiences to his pile,
and drifted into literature by way of his own
adventures.
Writes D.R.W. : The Bulletin some
time ago quoted a par. to the effect
that a brother of Lindsay Gordon,
with papers to prove his identity, had
died in a N.S.W. up-country hospital.
This, from a letter lately received from
Major-General F. T. Whingate, may have
interest: “As to Lindsay Gordon having
had a brother—it is absolute nonsense. I
knew the family intimately, and can state
positively that Gordon's parents had but
three children, viz. : A.L.G. and his two
sisters. What is more, I never at any time
heard mention made of any other children
who had formed part of the family, and who
had died or disappeared. Had there been
such, it is almost impossible that I should not
have been aware of the fact..

To Correspondents. — Ipswich : Haven’t
an American edition of Twain’s “Yankee,”
but a recollection of a hastily-scanned copy
gives no ground for saying the Eng. edition
differs. Anyhow, the Eng. edition is quite
enough to knock the stuffing out of a straw
monarch. Just let this soak in ;
You see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one’s
country, not to its institutions or its office-holders.
The country is the real thing, the substantial
thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing to watch
over, and care for, and he loyal to; institutions
axe extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and
clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be
comfortable, cease to protect the body from winter,
disease, and death. To be loyal to rags, to shout
for rags, to worship rags, to die for rags —that is a
loyalty of unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs
to monarchy, was invented by monarchy; let
monarchy keep it.
W.Y. ; Heine’s poems are untranslatable,
and nearly all his fragrance is lost in Bow-
ring’s translation, which is, however, correct
in the main and cheap (45.). There are
many versions of scattered poems ; James
Thomson’s are the happiest we know.
Here is his rendering of the familiar “ Ein
Fichtenbaum steht einsam ” :
A pine-tree standeth lonely
In the North on an upland bare ;
It r.tandeth whitely shrouded
With snow, and sleepeth there :
It dreameth of a palm-tree,
Which far in the East alone
In mournful silence standeth
On its ridge of burning stone.
Heine’s prose works are splendidly done in
8 vols. (445.) by “ Hans Breitmann” Leland;
but you can get several good selections at
Is. 9d. each.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir,—Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly cubing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry

more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, kc.,

THE TERRIFIC TWINGES
Endured by Rheumatics are first soothed
and in the end permanently relieved by
that beneficient annihilator of pain
and preventitive of its return,
Canadian Healing Oil,
a combination of six medicinal oils, devoid
of alcohol, and consequently non-evapor-
ating when applied. Economic, because
little of it is usually required to produce
the desired effects, and the small cost of
which is rendered doubly insignificant by
contrast with the salutary results which it
achieves. It is equally safe whether taken
internally or externally, is applicable to
diseases and injuries ofhorses and cattle,
as well as toman, and exterminates Throat
and Lung Diseases, Catarrh, Dysentery,
Piles, Tumors, Sores, and a great num-
ber of other physical ailments.

TIRIMIC !
A DISEASE, not a CRIME,
The constant abuse of alcohol fosters a crave—
a crave insatiable and deadly. It deprives valu-
able men of all reason and respect; it drives them
to acts of indecency and crime, and to drink what
their palates may even repel. At this stage
pledges and punishment prove useless, and
physical, as well as mental attention, is urgently
required.
The Orient Institute
has established a wonderful reputation in the
curing of this awful disease, and, during the past
18 months, many prominent men of our colony
have been restored to health, sobriety and
position. Alcoholic stimulants become not only
unnecessary, bub, in the majority of cases, un-
palatable. Patients undergo no inconvenience or
restraint, and are free to eat and drink what they
like.
UNQUESTIONABLE TESTIMONY.
“I had heard of the excellent results attending your
work, and was thereby induced to send my friend to you.
The results have exceeded my most sanguine expectations.
For the previous five years he has always been under the
influence cf alcohol and gradually losing power to resist
it. Since he has been under your treatment a marvellous
change has been wrought in him. Not only does he
appear to be thoroughly cured of drinking, but his
appearance, which had been degenerating, has improved,
and his color is healthy and bright. In short, the man
seems not only to have been purged of disease, but also
renewed mentally and physically.”
R. M. Me. ANDERSON, 38 Pitt-St.
“ I sent a gentleman to Mr. Thomas for treatment in
April, 1894—about the worst case I ever knew—and the
effects have been most wonderful.”
ARCHDEACON LANGLEY.
“In the case of a gentleman whom I recommended
to the Orient for treatment of dipsomania (May, 1894),
the cure was both rapid and lasting.”

BLOUSE! SHOW.
So popular a garment is the BLOUSE that vve
deem it right to assign it a position of special pro-
minence in our show of new Spring Goods.
To begin with, the BLOUSE suits the times,
because it suits the pocket, and yet so accommo-
dating is it as regards cost and quality that
BLOUSES are available at almost any price.
There is the simple homely BLOUSE of Cotton
or Muslin, and the BLOUSE of rich and handsome
Silk. To use a vulgar, though expressive, phrase,
“You Pays Your Money atnd You Takes
Your Choice. ”
For the former and simpler kind we must record
our most fervent admiration ; for the latter we have
only rapturous words of delight. There is no figure
that the BLOUSE does not suit; it is appropriate
when the waist is slim and the form slight, and
when a fair share of AVOIRDUPOIS is a notice-
able feature in the wearer. There is something of
universatility in the suitability of the BLOUSE
for all-round wear. It matters not when or where,
in the house, in the Street, out boating, on the race-
course, at the theatre, in the concert-room, at
Government House, or in poor dwellings as far
away from Vice-regal splendour as Chowder Bay
from Rotton Row.

si
Mr

mL
The only really successful prevent*
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, CuticurA Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately- medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Death wandered into my home last night,
And took my child, tho’ I held him fast; _
Tho’ I fought Death long for my heart's delight.
He conquered me in the strife at last.
And the brown eyes closed in their last deep
sleep,
And the restless hands in my hands were
still,
And someone whispered, “ Why should you
weep?
He has gone to rest—it is God’s great will.”
But I fain would weep as in days of old ;
The pagan mothers might mourn and cry
When their well-loved dead in their arms lay cold ;
Nohopes “beyond” when they said “Good-bye!”
For I am but human, my thoughts will cling
To the little child who is all alone ;
Though they tell me gently how angels bring
The infant souls to the dazzling throne.
He might lose his way in the bright star-mist,
He might call and call and I would not know,
And the smile would fade from the lips I kissed
When they took him from me so long ago.
It is but a day and it seems like years ;
The night is dark and the wind is chill;
I can only think, in my useless tears,
Of my child alone on the wind-swept hill.
For my babe is laid ’neath the new-turned sod—
I am but human, my heart is there;
And God will forgive—if there be a God
Who lays the hearts of His creatures bare.
“Weep not ! ” they whisper, he is at rest
With angels now in eternal joy ;
But I only know that my yearning breast
Will never shelter my baby boy.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You who sit with idle hands alone
In the empty splendour of your throne,
In the desert you call heaven, and dream
The fulfilment of your spacious scheme;
How your primal impulse still is surging,
Force on force converging,
Swirling suns and systems on is urging,
Till space pulses as one perfect theme !
You who hear Man’s ceaseless praises rise,
Mingled with his curses and his cries,
Waiting till from vague, discordant wrong
You shall mould the mighty spheral song !
See you not the millions of the working
In their warrens lurking,
With the grief of toil their spirits irking?
Yet upon your earth they think, live, throng 1
They have neither passions nor restraints :
They are neither sinning men nor saints.
Can you punish them or praise, when they
Have no time to blaspheme or to pray ?
They are not within your churches chanting,
Nor on footways flaunting,
But within their warren workshops, panting,
Silent, songless, toiling through the day !
Are you blind, and deaf, as well as dumb?
Do no voices through your silence come?
Is each pant and curse a dull appeal
Smothered by the snarling of the wheel?
More machine-like grows each man and woman,
Shut their massy tomb in,
While their mindless engines grow more human—
Great, gaunt, bloodless things of steel!
There are some who may repentance win,
Haloed with some sudden, splendid sin.
Look on these whom only labor drives ;
Loose a little while their leaden gyves.
You who fling strange glints and golden graces
On earth’s sombre places,
Put a little color in their faces—
Put a little color in their lives !

66 Yankee Doodle , 99 blended with Polities .
The above is, of course, a caricature of the famous American national picture, which will be
given later on.
“YANKEE DOODLE” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has evei
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement, for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this?
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business has keen built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford to
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIN SON & SONS, who use more American leaf
than all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several high-class brands: —“CON-
QUEROR,” “SIR ROGER,” “CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR;” but “YANKEE DOODLE'
ranks supreme.

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1895.
Praying for Rain: Second Chapter.
(1) Is it a fact that N.S.W. Executive recently set apart
a day for humiliation and prayer for rain ?
(2) If so, was the experiment satisfactory?
(3) If so, will the Government take into consideration
the fact that no rain of any importance has fallen in the
Western District, and in view of the great distress pre-
vailing on account of the long-continued drought in the
Western part of this country will the Government take
into consideration the advisability of gazetting a special
day for humiliation and prayer for rain for the Western
District only ? Question by Richard Sleatii,
disallowed by Speaker Abbott.
A few weeks ago the province of New South
Wales was suffering badly from a general
want of rain. Therefore the Government,
incited by the clerical element of the com-
munity and by Education Minister Jacob
Garrard, who says that he and Ins col-
leagues are “a Goo-fearing Ministry,”
appointed a day of prayer and humiliation
for the essential moisture. The event was
fixed for a Sunday, apparently because the
Government hadn’t enough faith in the
experiment to lose a day’s work over it,
and it wasn’t fixed till three State Astro-
nomers had announced that rain might be
expected. There was no special humiliation
about the proceeding; the female ele-
ment of the community wore its best
frock as usual instead of going to
church in sackcloth and with bare feet
and ashes on its head, and the male element
looked the same as it does at other times—
in fact, there was no visible humiliation. In
the olden days, when people had still suffi-
cient faith in their creed to be willing to
look ridiculous for its sake, they would pro-
bably have humiliated in rags, and on all-
fours, and with their hair in a state of weird
disarrangement, but that kind of thing
belongs to a bygone era. Also the popula-
tion didn’t pray more than usual, and there
was hardly any noticeable increase in the
congregations, which are small at the best of
times. So that the situation is that nobody
humiliated and only about one-sixth of the
population went to church ; and of that
fraction the Catholics didn't pray for rain at
all -their prayers being fixed for the ensuing
month, so that the Catholic rain might he
kept distinct from the Protestant rain and
the exceedingly small fraction that remained
didn’t pray directly, but only at second-
hand through its pastor. In short, there
was a great and woeful lack of energy about
the proceeding.
* # *
Nevertheless the rain came. In the
eastern part of the province, where droughts
are rare and of short continuance, and where
the downfall was less wanted, it came abun-
dantly. In the great, dry West, out
“where the Dead Men lie,” and where
droughts are long and dreadful, and rain
was most wanted, it came moderately in
some places, sparingly in others, while in
many districts it hardly arrived at all. But
the people of Sydney, whose ignorance of
the western regions is vast and pitiable,
assumed that because it sloshed down plenti-
fully in Pitt-street and Woollooraooloo, the
drought had definitely broken up, and the
Church thereupon began to suffer from
swelled head over its success, and the
Cabinet announced that’ it was “a God-
fearing Ministry,” and reached out for the
pious vote on account of the rain, and a day
of thanksgiving was held for the great bless-
ing that had partly arrived. And even while
the thanksgiving was in progress the thirst-
maddened cattle were still dying in the far
west; and the gaunt horses still dropped by
the wayside; and the drought, in many
localities, was very much as before.
• * *
Therefore, Mr. Slbath’s question was per-
fectly natural and logical. The churches
asked Providence to work a miracle on
their behalf. They assumed that without
their prayers the rain would not have
arrived, therefore its arrival was a miracle,
and they returned thanks on that assump-
tion. Also, they suffered from the afore-
mentioned attack of swelled head on the
same assumption. Even the fact that the
rain came mostly where it usually comes
without any supernatural interference, and
that it stayed away mostly in the
x’egions where it generally stays away, and
where, by reason of its customary staying
away it was most wanted, and that it fell also
in Queensland and Victoria where there had
been no day of humiliation and prayer, made
no difference to the clerical mind. Assum-
ing, therefore, that Providence had directly
interfered in the matter, it is obviously quite
as much within the power of the Infinite to
send lavish rains all over the dry plains of
the West, if asked to do so. It is also quite
as much within its power to remove the
curse of poverty and want of work, and to
cause a great revival of trade which will
supply employment and wages for all who
want them. Man has found remedies for
want of rain in irrigation and artesian wells,
but no one has yet found even the semblance
of an adequate and practicable cure for the
ever-prevalent want of employment ; there-
fore the latter is a much fitter subject for
prayer than the former. Rain always comes
sooner or later, prayer or no prayer, so no
one can say for certain that its coming is the
result of prayer. Abundant work and a
living wage for everybody never come—at
least, never within the memory of man —so
their coming after prayer would be almost a
sure sign of divine interference. Yet the
churches, with this splendid opening for
demonstrating the efficacy of prayer and
for showing their faith in their own creed,
never set apart a special occasion for prayers
for work and good wages. They always lift
the light end of the log and leave the heavy
end carefully alone.
* * #
The question raised by Sleath, M.L.A.,
was, however, a less difficult one than this.
He simply asked (h it, if the Government
felt assured, as it j ro essed (per medium of
Minister Garrard; to be, that the rain which
recently fell in the damp parts of the pro-
vince was an answer to prayer, it would pray
again for rain in the dry regions where the
supply is still deficient. As"it rains occasion-
ally in these parts, even in the worst year, he
did not ask for anything very extraordinary.
Yet his request met with a cold reception.
The question was first disallowed for no
visible reason, and when at last he did con-
trive to bring the matter before the House
he received an evasive and unsatisfactory
reply. Since then the Government has
done nothing further in the matter ; neither
have the churches ; neither has anybody
else. The clergy, having succeeded in bring-
ing down abundance of rain in a region
where it comes without prayer, or having
been in the vicinity when it came according
to the natural course of events, are appar°
ently not prepared to risk their sudden repu-
tation by trying to bring it down in a region
where it only comes occasionally either
through prayer or cursing or by any other
natural or unnatural means. Nor 'has The
Bulletin’s suggestion of a fortnight ago, that
there should be set apart a day of humilia-
tion and prayer for work and good wages,
evoked any response. Yet no believer can
deny that the one evil is as easily remedied by
the Almighty as the other, if the Almighty
does answer prayer by spasmodic interfer-
ences with the fixed order of Creation. This
world is a very, very small affair—the mere
shadow of a speck of dust on the outer rim
of infinity ; and all the doings on its surface
are only “ a trouble of ants in the light of a
million million of suns.’ If the theory of
Divine interference is correct, it is such a
very small affair to set right all that problem
of poverty and stagnation for which man can
find no workable remedy—it is asking an
.easier thing from the Omnipotent than if we
asked the greatest earthly autocrat to order
his minions to command somebody to dot
the “i” in Pakkes’s worst poem. And the
churches believe in the necessity of it; and
they likewise believe, or profess to believe,
in the existence of their Deity ; and they
fully believe, or profess to believe, that
He constantly departs from what would
otherwise be the fixed order of the universe
in order to answer human appeals for aid.
And yet the suggestion that they should
specially supplicate for honest work and
honestly-earned wages evokesj no response.
They keep on praying for the thing that is
dead-sure to come soon in any case ; but
they won’t pray (as proposed by Sleath)
for the thing that generally comes late ; and
still less will they pray for the thing which,
in the ordinary course of events, doesn’t
come at all.
• # #
The church, in fact, has little faith, or no
faith at all, in its own creed, and it takes no
avoidable risks. Still, it is burdened with
certain risks which were handed down to it
by its more reckless forefathers. Therefore,
it petitions regularly according to set formu-
las to be delivered from battle, murder, and
sudden death, and all three continue to exist
much as before. It asks for deliverance
from pestilence, and in the cities where men
are clean and pious, and also where they
are clean and not pious, there is no pestil-
ence, and where they are pious and not
clean, or where they are neither clean nor
pious, there is pestilence with the usual
regularity. Also, the Church has prayed for
many, many years that all the nobility may
be endowed with grace, wisdom and under-
standing, and the only result, so far, is that
part of the nobility is endowed with under-
standing, and part of it is only endowed with
money made out of breweries, and a good
part is endowed with nothing in particular
save a yearning to wed some painted Flossie
of the ballet. Also, it prays constantly
that all magistrates may execute justice and
maintain truth, yet the J.P. is as foolish and
objectionable as usual, and shows no sign of
improvement. In all these matters many
long years of supplication have brought no
answer, but the public has grown so used to
hearing the old, stereotyped impossible
appeal that it has forgotten what the appeal
is about, or forgotten to expect an answer,
or forgotten to wonder why the answer
never comes. So the Church still professes
to believe in the efficacy of prayer, and its
followers never seem to notice the awful dis-
crepancy ot things.
* » m
The whole question resolves itself, so far
as all available evidence goes, somewhat as
follows,: The world exists ; no one knows
exactly where it came from, or how it came
from there, or where it is going to, or how
it will get there, but its existence, at all
events, seems reasonably certain. If the
churches think they know where it came
from or where it is going to, they have a
perfect right to do so. It is governed by
certain laws ; if the churches think they
know who made these laws, that is their own
affair exclusively. When man has found out
all these laws, he will probably be able
to abolish droughts, floods, bad crops,
disease, and most of his other troubles,
and then it will be a beautiful and
harmonious globe ; or, at all events, it
will be much more beautiful and harmonious
than it is at present. Until ho finds out
these laws he has to take the consequences
of his ignorance. The machine never stops
to take account of anyone. It makes no
allowance for anybody’s ignorance. No
extraneous power that can be"appealed to by
prayer, or the pounding of tom-toms, or the
burning of incense, or by abasement before
Joss, or by hymns, or drums, or any other
kind of discord ever stops the wheels for one
instant, or varies the course of events by one
hair s-breadth. Therefore, it seems that
all the sects on earth may pray for
ever for rain, or the abolition of pestil-
ence, or for the endowment of the
nobility with wisdom, but unless they first
find out why rain is scarce, and pestilence
exists, and the nobility is so very short of
wisdom, they will get no further. And if
the sects are not yet convinced of this, and
if they really believe in their own profes-
sions, then let them try an experiment by
praying unanimously, not for something that
always comes in any case, but for something
that is very much wanted and which never
yet has come. The public is ready enough
—much too ready, in fact—to believe in
supernatural interferences; all it wants is
one such interference that can stand reason-
able inspection.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Tree Postage and Free Telegrams.
Maoriland post and telegraph department
yields for the year just closed a net profit of
.£57,478. The New South Wales service, which
has twice the revenue, shows a loss of ,£123,967,
or, allowing for interest on money spent for con-
struction, a loss of ,£222,030. A good part of
this amount, which the province makes good
out of taxation, is the cost of carrying news-
papers free of postage by way of granting Pro-
tection to the Sydney press against country
and foreign papers. Every Sydney morning
paper which goes into the country to explain
the beauties and advantages of Freetrade is
protected to the extent of 50 percent. And
not one shoddy journal lias yet raised its voice
against tin's iniquity, for Freetrade is alwavs
intended solely for the other man. The spec-
tacle of the Herald and Telegraph and
other papers, not forgetting The Bulle-
tin, sponging on a" department which
is so utterly bankrupt as this is
sordid and disgusting, and is suggestive of a
wealthy capitalist stealing a copper from a
blind beggar. Meanwhile a new aspect of the
situation is threatening. Free newspaper-
postage is only beneficial to papers which cir-
culate largely outside their own postal dis-
tricts. The hungry, little country “rag,”*with
a small circulation within a very narrow area,
gets no benefit from it whatever ; it circulates,
as a rule, in one locality only and not very
much there, and the owner has to deliver his
production by hand as heretofore. Meanwhile
the city paper, which is much larger and
more up-to-date than its poor bush rival, is
brought up by train, or coach, or steamer, or
mounted mailman, at the cost of the taxpayer,
and distributed by the postman, also at the
cost of the taxpayer, so that the country journal
is crushed out even on its own ground. There-
fore the scribe of the ’possum and native-
bear region now demands that he should
get his news telegrams free, which means
more cost to the taxpayer, to restore the
balance. P.M.G. Cook replied in the House
that this was wholly impossible, but the
bush editor will probably stick to his point and
keep on agitating, and though the influence of
one little smudgy paper published in the town
of Goo-forgotten is almost nil, the influence of
many dozens of such organs is very appreci-
able. By-and-bye, the aggregate country
editor will become solid on the question, and
his attitude will be that he must either get
his news telegrams free or he will be con-
stantly and consistently “agin” the Govern-
ment, just as the city editor is “ agin ” every
Government which threatens to stop his free
postage. And then the State must either
abolish the present free postage scandal or else
add the free telegram scandal to it to make
things square. And as the State’s present
rulers haven’t pluck or honesty or brains
enough to abolish the existing iniquity they
will probably cave in and pacify the country
papers, and after that the city papers will
want their news telegrams gratis also, and there
will be a really good time ahead for the huge
and unnecessary New South Wales post and
telegraph deficiency.
More Syndicatism.
A bill is to be brought suddenly before N.S.W.
Parliament in the last days of the session,
when the Assembly is tired and demoralised,
authorising a “syndicate” to constructan under-
ground electric railway from Sydney to North
Shore, ihis scheme, it is alleged, has been in
preparation for two years, but it has been pre-
pared in an atmosphere of such strict secresy
that, till last Monday, hardly a single person
outside the syndicate knew of its existence.
The proposed line is to start from about the cor-
ner of George and King streets and connect with
Milson’s Point. It will cost an enormous
amount of money—British money presumably—
and it may or may not supply a long-felt want,
according to circumstances. At the same time,
there are many good reasons why it should be
remorselessly biffed out of Parliament as a
subtle and dangerous fraud upon posterity, and
every M. L. A. who votes for it, or fails to vote
against it, should be called to account by bis
constituents. The question at issue is not
whether the spec, would or would not be a
paying concern ; it might return huge dividends
or it might never pay 1 per cent on the capital
sunk, but it is equally objectionable either way.
North Sydney will ultimately be a great city,
with a large suburban population spread all
over the space between Lane Cove and
Middle Harbor, and on the other side of Mid-
dle Harbor towards Manly. This population
will be served by the Government railway and
tramway as far as Milson’s Point. On the other
side the city railway must ultimately be ex-
tended to the water’s edge, and when this is
done the syndicate proposes to hold the con-
necting-link between the two systems. When
the State line is carried right through the city,
then that, and not the present awkward devia-
tion via Strathfield, will be the direct route
from Adelaide to Brisbane - the greatest
national railway in Australia, and one of the
greatest in the world. But there will be a
cumbersome and absurd gap in the route ; it
will be a great State line through four pro-
vinces and over 2000 miles of country—all ex-
cept about one mile of private line which will
intervene in the busiest part of the route !
The Government may, of course, make its own
connecting link if it pleases, but, in the first
place, the syndicate will hold the best and
shortest route, and the only two good landing
places—Dawes Point on one side and Milson’s
Point on the other ; and its occupation of the
latter site will make it practically impossible
for the Government to connect its two lines un-
less it moves the North Sydney station to an
altogether new site. Milson’s Point is a narrow
spot where there isn’t sufficient space for two
submarine railways to emerge side by side.
Further, if the Goverment made a longer and
more costly line by some other track it would
still lose much local traffic by the competition
of the private railway, and, amid all these
troubles, the chances are that the State would
be glad to buy out the syndicate at a very
high figure and be rid of it. The fact that the
said syndicate—though it professes to have
been incubating for two years—only rushed for-
ward when it became known that the Govern-
ment was really thinking of tunnelling the har-
bor, suggests that it exists chiefly for the pur-
pose of getting a concession gratis from the
State and then selling it back again at a big
price. Possibly it wouty never build anv line
at all. By the time it had got hold of the best
tunnel site the Government would probably
awake to the situation, and would give the co.
a great many thousands to get out of the road
and not build its railway at all.
Legal Privilege.
4 What will they do about O’Halloran ? ”
was a general query in Melbourne when the
police-raid on Oxenham and Abrahams’
(betting) office got into print. The misguided
hand of the law had actually captured a
solicitor along with four professional gamblers !
The public soon learned that the lawyer was a
privileged visitor to the “ common gaming-
house.” The Crown Prosecutor, it was an-


nounced, “ did not desire to proceed against
Mr. o’Hallor.an. That gentleman w’as only
charged with being on die premises, and was
prepared to swear that he went there on pro-
fessional business and nob with the object of
gaming. He had met his client, Mr. Abra-
hams, at the Commercial Hotel, and merely
followed him into his office to conduct the busi-
ness between them more conveniently.” The
nature of the business discussion was nob
stated, but its grave importance may ho
assumed from the fact that it began in a
pub. and was continued in the alleged
gaming-house where bets were made on Caul-
field Guineas morning. Under the circum-
stances Magistrate Panton could merely beam
upon O’Halloran, and express surprise at such
a well-known lawyer being “ caught on the
premises.” Now, were the said O’Halloran
other than a lawyer he might have accompanied
Abrahams for the most innocent and respect-
able of purposes, and would yet have failed to
escape prosecution. Brown, the tailor, or
Jones, the draper, might, in such a case, tell
his true tale of legitimate business to a Crown-
Prosecutor’s deaf ear, more especially if Brown
or Jones were an inveterate backer of horses.
The law has a habit of supposing that every
person captured in a gaming-house is there for
an unlawful purpose, unless the person be a
solicitor. Mr. O’Halloran’s profession saved
him from the misfortune of unjust suspicion
and prosecution. There is, seemingly, no end
to a lawyer’s list of privileges. Incriminating
circumstances roll away from his char-
acter like water from a duck’s back.
But, to return to the bould O’Halloban. As
soon as the lawyer’s satisfactory explanation
was made known to the court, bookmaker
Sammy Allen spoke up for his innocence.
Said swarthy Samuel : “ I’m placed in the
same predicament as Mr. Halloran (laughter).
I simply went into the shop. I’m not interested
in Abrahams’ shop. I just met him outside ”
(laughter). The bookmaker’s excuse was rather
more convincing, on the face of it, than the
other gentleman’s excuse, bookies being
gregarious animals, who frequent one another’s
betting-shops in a casual sorb of way. Anyway,
the unwisdom of worrying Allen (whilst allow-
ing the lawyer to clear himself so easily) must
have been apparent to Panton, P.M., for
Samuel, though remanded with the other sus-
pects, was not required to find bail.
The triangular duel for the N.S.W. Legis-
lative Assembly seat which Meagher lost
through breathing his gruesome tale into
the ear of Salomons resulted in the return of
sturdy old Henry Copeland by a majority of
120 votes. The Protectionist candidate gob 423
votes ; the Foreign-trader, 303 ; and the Labor
candidate, 163. Consequently, the Foreign-
trade papers now point out that there is in
Phillip Division a large Government majority,
and that the seat was jumped by a minority
representative through the sinful cussedness of
the Labor man in splitting the Foreign-trade
vote. This may be, and, on the other hand, it
may not be ; it is mere assumption in any case.
The Foreign-trade vote represents the straight
Government party ; the vote which put Cope-
land in represents the party which constantly
opposes the Government; and the Labor-vote
represents the party which says that the
Government is a hypocritical crowd that
hates democratic principles and would not even
attempt democratic legislation if it were not
driven along by the Labor members under pain
of losing its miserable salary. The Labor-party
states, in effect, that the Opposition is its open
and unscrupulous enemy and the Government
its false friend. Under these conditions the
cheerful assumption that it there had been no
Labor candidate the 163 men who voted for
Wilson would have voted for Hodgson instead
is a tolerably impudent affair. In any case,
New South Wales badly wants the second
ballot, partly to prevent minority representa-
tion and partly to shut up the wolfish howl of
the Telegraph that whenever its party is
defeated it loses through the splitting up of
the vote.
When the Land-tax becomes law in N.S. Wales,
there will be an excellent opportunity to pass
an Act decreeing that all land resumed by the
State for railways, roads, or other public pur-
poses shall be taken over at Land-tax valuation
with, say, 10 per cent, added for “ disturbance.”
The tax will provide a reliable valuation for all
estates above the exemption limit, and it will
also supply a partial valuation for estates below
that limit; in other words, it will prove that
their value does not exceed the amount of the
exemption, whatever that may be. It would
be a glaring and ridiculous scandal for the
Treasury to collect the tax on an estate at the
valuation of £2 an acre for many years, and then
suddenly find itself ordered by the usual pig-
headed jury to pay £lO an acre for the same
property when it is w’anted for railway purposes.
And yet that is exactly what will happen unless
some steps are taken to exclude the pig-headed
jury from the matter altogether. If Govt,
will adopt the simple and equitable plan above
suggested, then the only place where the old
swindle can come in is in the valuation of
fences, buildings, and other improvements, and
an ordinary post-and-rail fence doesn’t offer the
same facilities for stupendous lying as the
land-question does. It is true that a Vic. rail-
way commissioner once paid £4O or £5O com-
pensation for one small tree, on the ground that
it was much prized by the family and its
removal was calculated to lacerate the owner’s
feelings, but that was exceptional. Not one
landowner in a hundred has the financial genius
to exact a small fortune in compensation for
one tree and some alleged “feelings.”
The Queensland rabbit is a most adaptive
animal. He can exist on any kind of vegetation
found in the South-West except the needle-bush,
and on this he is at present experimenting. He has
learnt to swim, to climb, and (according to some
authorities) to jump about in the trees like a
’possum. At present he is desperately trying to
adapt himself to a diet of phosphorus, sugar and
pollard, but so far with indifferent suco. a. He
doesn’t increase and multiply everywhere a some
suppose; 25 years ago rabbits were inmerous on
someof thestationsontheGladstone-Maryii f ugh
road, but not a trace of them is now to lie found.
Perhaps some bush naturalist can explain why.

The French have captured Antananarivo.
A few weeks ago, when they were nearing that
capita], it was cabled that the missionaries were
not going to bolt from the city ; they “ preferred
to die at their posts.” This childish “ blow ” was
sent out all over the world, and all the mild old
ladies who keep png dogs and drink afternoon tea
field up their mittened hands in admiration at the
stupendous valor of the holy men who thus looked
death in the eye. Of course, the French troops
didn’t kill any missionaries, and no holy man
died at his post or ever expected to; and things
are just the same in Antananarivo, save that the
French have probably cleaned up the city a good
deal and invited the preachers to dinner.
The modern magazine-rifle seems likely to
be a failure, after all. The bullets are needle-like
in shape, and carry for immense distances, but
they go right through the enemy without causing
immediate disablement, unless they happen to
penetrate the brain or heart. In a recent Indian
campaign a gruesome story is told of a nigger who
was shot through by six separate bullets, three
of them in the body, and was finally captured
alive and still fighting. He recovered. Even
when the bullet strikes a bone it seldom breaks it.
In most cases it simply drills a small and very
neat hole right through it, and passes on, leaving
the patient still in fighting condition. It looks as
if the modern fire-arm has been improved too
much, and it may yet become necessary to hit out
with the butt-end, after all.
A Bathurst man who attended a recent
meeting of London unemployed, at Nelson’s
Monument, writes : —“lt was about the hollowest
affair of the kind I ever saw. The chief speakers
were Tom Mann, Ben Tillett, a socialistic local
preacher, and a Lancashire lass. Tom Mann, a
powerful-looking fellow, with an earnest, toil-
worn face, made a speech that breathed nothing
but fiery revolution. He advised the starving un-
employed to sack the butchers’ and bakers’ shops,
which evoked a feeble cheer. But the sight of a
few stalwart policemen, leisurely pacing round
the outskirts of the crowd, seemed to exercise a
deadening influence. When someone called out,
‘ Six o’clock ; I’m goin’to my dinner,’there was
a chorus of laughter. The idea of starving men
having a dinner to go to seemed to strike them as
a good joke. The crowd broke up, and in a few
minutes had melted away.”
“ Here ” (exclaims a Bulletin correspon-
dent in Western N.S.W.) “here is Minister

was never in a worse state. Stock are dying by
thousands. And, as for the rabbits —they are
literally heaped up outside the wire-netting
around the dams. If this God-fearing Ministry
doesn’t supplicate for us, there’ll be trouble.
Anyway, ‘Lands’ Carruthers ought. The re-
appraisement of runs and selections is just going
to be made, and if rain doesn’t fall soon down the
rents will go with an awful thud, and, of course,
will stay there for from seven to fourteen years.
As Treasurer, Reid ought also tg supplicate—in a
strictly business way. He’s ‘ the chap to save the
country,’ you know. If we can’t move the
N.S.W. Ministry, we’ll have to see what Kingston
can do in the matter.”
During the last few years great numbers
of horses which have grazed in the lower Darling
River country have become blind. After local
vets, had been baffled in their attempts to dis-
cover the cause and a remedy, Govt, officers were
sent out, and their reports, published two months
ago, were just as inconclusive. Subsequently, Dr.
Harvey, of Wentworth, theorises that the disease
was due to the transference of microbes from the
excreta of rabbits to the horses. Settlers, how-
ever, will have none of that theory. They say
they have wire-netted paddocks, killed the rabbits,
and then ploughed the ground, and afterwards
horses grazed thereon have gone blind. Some of
the settlers say that wild melons—the prickly
little “squashes”—are the cause; others that it
is the native tobacco-plant. The difficulty of
determining lies in the fact that all three—rabbits,
melons, and tobacco-plant generally flourish
together. Meantime it is agreed that the only
safe plan is to feed stock off the low sandy flats.
Already, however, hundreds of horses have become
wholly or partially blind.
“Did you ever see a standing man asleep ?
It is on record,” writes a Bulletin correspondent,
“that during the course of some of the ‘little’
South African wars, sentries (black) were found
soundly sleeping with legs widely separated, the
butt of the rifle on the ground, the arms folded on
the muzzle and the head laid on the arms.
I have walked by the side of a man so
fatigued that he slept as he trudged, and was only
awakened by colliding with the hedge at a turn of
the road, I saying nothing, just to see what the
sleeper would do. It is a common thing for bush-
men to sleep in the saddle, but in that case there
is no necessity for muscular rigidity of the legs.
Also, while voyaging between Tasmania and
England years ago, on one hot night in the
tropics, though not in the doldrums, I found the
officer of the watch, the apprentice, the man at
the wheel and the look-out all fast asleep, and the
barque “sailing herself.” I have likewise seen,
on a coasting steamer between Brisbane and
Sy Iney, the watch-officer standing in the corner
of his canvas-shelter dozing, the steersman with
his head on his folded arms on the wheel (steam-
gearing), and the lookout-man unmistakeably
asleep ; the resl of the watch making no pretence
of wakefulness. In the latter case it is not so
much the fault of the men as of the system, which
keeps them hard at work in port all day, and then
sends them on duty for the first watch without a
chance of resting. Under such circumstances men
often simply cannot keep awake—though it is only
fair to say that, in the case mentioned, a very
slight noise, such as a footfall on the bridge, was
enough to aroqse the sleepers. Still, given no
footfall, with a 16-knot ship, it does not require a
great space of time for her to be miles out of her
course; and given also a rock, with or without a
light, you have all the material for a first-class
wreck.”

In Walhalla(Gippsland, Yic.) region, where
much timber-felling is done, about 80 percent, of
the axemen are Italians (considered by many
people to be the best axemen in the world). They
are the personification of industry—working about
10 hours in winter and quite 14 hours a day in
summer. They live almost entirely on the fattest
bacon obtainable, bread and wine.
From a N.S.W. backblocks letter:—
“ Eight weeks on a hungry track. Got a week’s
work at last for a blacksmith cocky —such a nice
man. Have no particular hours—just from sun-
rise to sunset. Have just got my wages—a pair
of good pusher boots (second-hand) and a 2d.
stamp, which same is on this letter. Am off
again this morning to make my fortune.”
Have any Bulletin readers on this side
the continent seen the Westralian native potatoes
—“yook”? They grow along the salt lakes, in
loose sand. The plant is a tiny bush, and the
potatoes grow around it in a circle of from 15in.
to 18in. in radius. From one plant you may get
half a bagful. Look like lemons, and have a
peculiar smell. The pulp tastes like carrots, only
not so strong. They are succulent, and quench
thirst admirably.
Bringing up a child in a public-house
sharpens his wits. A few Sundays since, service
was being held on a Northern N.S.W. river, in a
hall near the hotel. The landlord’s little son,
barefooted, ragged and very dirty, strolled up to
the door, and, seeing the priest, a great favorite
of his, walked in and took a seat by his friend.
The collection-box having been passed round, the
child waited till the money was poured on the
table in front of the clergyman, and then, pluck-
ing his reverence by the sleeve, the son of his
father whispered—“ Say, shall I run and tell dad
you are going to have a tarnbooroora ? ”
Dear Bulletin, — I a|feo have cured a
horse of jibbing. In this way.’ The brute stopped
in the middle of a sheet of water, about 100yds.
wide and 2ft. deep. A tentative application of
the whip made him look as if he would kick. I
was alone, so that the idea of taking him out and
walking him up and down through the water
would not do, as no one would have been left to
take care of the buggy. So I lit up a small fire—
not under him, but about 6ft. or 7ft. behind him—
in a pipe. Then I fell asleep. When I awoke, we
were out of that water, and about two miles nearer
homo. This is the best plan I have ever tried.—
Horse-traineb.
The S.A. Local Option Bill, now before
Parliament, provides that one-tenth of the rate-
payers in any district may demand a poll on the
liquor question. One-fourth of the ratepayers
must vote to make the poll valid ; a bare majority
of the votes may decide that no new licences will
be granted, or that the existing licences may be
reduced by one-third or even two-thirds, while a
two-thirds majority of the votes may enforce abso-
lute Prohibition. A vote either way is definite
for three years. Meanwhile, no one seems to
know how the State will make up the loss of the
drink income when Prohibition arrives. Nearly
.£2,000,000 a year of beautiful revenue will go
bung with the arrival of the Cold-Tea epoch, and
it will probably cost another half-million to hunt
after and convict people suspected of making
illicit grog in the cellar.
When the Local Option Bill was booming
merrily through Maoriland Parliament, one hard-
headed M.H.R. arose to ask how, when the
accursed drink was abolished, they were going to
replace the liquor-revenue of £440,000 per annum.
No one answered, and the Bill went on bootnii g
as before. The one fact that the teetotaller
declines to face is that the liquor-revenue in Aus-
tralasia amounts to 15s. or £1 per head of the
population, and that when the unclean thing is
abolished this will have to be made up in some
other way. And whereas the liquor money comes
only from the drinking section of the community,
the new taxation will probably hit all classes
alike, so that the Cold Tea man will have to pay a
lot more taxes than he does at present. This will
be especially rough on the teetotal lecturer ; he
will not only have to pay more taxes, but he will
lose a good paying billet for want of any more
drink to lecture about.
A great effort is going to be made in
Maoriland Parliament to procure the exemption
from legacy duty of all bequests for religious pur-
poses and for the encouragement of literature and
the fine arts. The idea is to avoid payment of
£12,000 duty on a pile which a deceased citizen
has bequeathed for pious purposes. The church
is an exceedingly tough subject for taxation. It
already dodges land and income taxes, and it is
always yearning after more exemptions. And yet
no valid reason has ever been advanced why the
church should not pay on exactly the same basis
as the public-house and the grocery and the pig-
farm ; it only avoids payment because the average
legislator has a weak, hazy idea that if he aggra-
vates the tabernacle in this world something bad
may happen to him in the next, and he knows
that nothing makes the tabernacle boil over so
dreadfully as parting with money. The church is
the biggest and most persistent deadhead on
earth, and the best that can be said for it is that
the pig-farming business or the ready-made boot
interest would be quite as aggressive if it had the
same superstition at its back.
Edgar’s story, “Te Arero Maori,” sug-
gests to a Bulletin correspondent the fact that
another attempt to establish a Maori newspaper is
just now being made in Wellington (M.L.). A
local firm of printers are in it, likewise a half-caste
native agent and interpreter, who has already
begun a canvass. R. S. Thompson, a journalist
well-known in M.L., is to be editor, with an
interest in the venture. If varied experience is a
qualification for the editorship of a Maori news-
paper. R.S.T. should fill the bill. Son of a clergy-
man (Eng.), a soldier in the Maori war, West
Coast miner when Premier Seddon was a store-
keeper in a very small way, a pakeha-Maori, who, -
by his persistency in re native affairs, has made
every officer in the M.L. Lands Office dread the
mention of the name of Queenie Thompson
(R.S.F.’s “quarter-caste” wife, who owns land
that has been in dispute for a quarter of a cen-
tury), and who tells the best stories of Hori Grey
to be heard in Maoriland, he ought certainly to be
able to run the as yet unnamed paper. Te Waka
Maori (Maori Canoe) went bung, though (or
because?) run by Govt. Private enterprise is now
to have a show —always providing the Maories are
not too lazy to pay up. 40,000 Maories and their
friends should surely be able to support one paper
among them. The latest proposal is to run it as
a half-caste print—half in each language.
CONVICT PHELOSIPHY.
My name is poor Jack.
I’ve done my whack.
In sin and disepation.
As A gambler and thief.
I have bean chief.
With all its degridation.
But I hope I am one.
Whoes name will be John.
Now ive seen my sin and folley.
For as gambler and thief.
Has brought me to grief.
In it there is nothing so jolley.
Aii the lad is A fool.
That practises the rule.
Of trickery and deception.
For it is sure to bring.
Him an unpleaseut sling.
By way of A fools correction.
THE CONVICT IN CHAINES.
In the happy days of childhood.
Of innocence and bliss.
Did I ever think that manhood.
Would bring such A curse as thiss.
Then I was free from laws alarms.
Its perils and its pains.
But now I am in A foreign land.
A poor convict in chaines.
I once was young and happy.
In A mothers fond embrace.
But now 1 am old and shabby.
And in the very worst disgrace.
Bub the cause is all ray own.
By seeking dishonist gaines.
I am in A dungeon thrown.
A poor convict in chaines.
Oh how I wish that I had bean.
A virtueous lionist lad.
I should not have such trouble sean.
Enough to drive me mad.
I should lie free and happy now.
From all my galling paines.
Instead of in A prison cell.
A poor convict in chaines.
But happy am I that now I can see.
Before it is too late.
That even now I can prepear.
To avoid A Ur mo.e wretchard fate.
May God cive me grace to (nay.
To av ide salans hurtling pains.
And make me happy in ct. rnily.
Free from sin and sorrows chaines.

George Leitch’s great spectacle, “The
Land of the Moa,” at Sydney Royal, is even a
more gorgeous affair than previous reports seemed
to indicate. From a literary point of view it is
moderately respectable up to the end of the third
act, and after that it is a weird whirl and whiz of
miscellaneous glitter and horror, so that it doesn’t
matter whether it is respectable or not. The plot
is apparently an adaptation of Besant’s tale,
“Over the Sea with a Sailor.” There is the same
girl, and her artist lover, and her bad uncle who
is a pilot, only lie is called Samson Noblem instead
of Stephen Cobbledick; and the same garish
Yankee captain entices the girl on board bis ship
with her uncle’s assistance and carries her away
across the sea. Then he is thunder-blasted by the
appearance on board of bis former girl, who is a
Maori this time instead of a quadroon ; and be is
chased by a British gunboat instead of a Federal
cruiser; and wrecked in Maoriland in place of
Virginia; and the two girls are turned loose among
the natives instead of among the riff-raff of the
borderland. And, finally, the artist rescues them
just like Besant’s artist, and the wicked captain
is thrown into a geyser and boiled, whereas the
original wicked captain was thrown into Niagara;
and the maundering old pilot charges his nieee
with ingratitude and points out that he found her
on a raft in the Bay of Bengal, whereas the
original Cobbledick states that he found his niece
on a raft in the same place, wrapped in 44 ban-
danna handkerchiefs.
• # *
The co. is a long way above the usual melo-
dramatic level. George Leitcb’s pilot is a strange,
comic, snuffling old man who is a most interesting
study. The captain, who would be a shrieking
pirate under worse circumstances, is made by
Dacre a fine, robust, affable, gentlemanly cut-
throat, whom it is a pleasure to meet; and Miss
Amy Roselle’s Maori girl is a soul-satisfying
effort. Mi»s Polly Emery is another aboriginal
lady who helps the dtaina along materially, and
Cathcart, Keightley, and Frank Hawthorne do
some respectable work in between the various
explosions. The “ Land of the Moa ” is a most
explosive drama, and full of beauteous scenery.
Nearly every historic beauty-spot in Maoriland
is thrown in regardless of expense—geysers,
craters, and hot springs are quite common,
and the Pink Terraces of Rotomaiiana are a
dream of unearthly splendor. The volcano has
an act all to itself, and through four scenes it
explodes, and blasts around, and fills the country
with fire and ashes and great chunks of desolation,
and tears the hills asunder, and most of the co. is
buried among tlie ruins. Asa high-class family
explosion this eruption takes the cake. A whole
lot of picturesque and blood-curdling Maori dances
are also scattered through tlie drama, and the
whoops of the natives, and their songs, and the
bounding of their dark brown legs make up a
spectacle such as the Australian stage has never
seen before. Also, it isn’t likely ever to see it
again, for the Maori is sinking into a beastly state
of civilisation and death, and soon there won’t be
one really picturesque yell left in Maoriland.

The comic opera season at Sydney Lyceum
ends to-night (Timrsday) with a bill made
up pieces of “ Paul Jones,” “ Gondoliers,”
“The Mountebanks,” “Pinafore,” and “ Ma
Mie Rosette.” Public opinion concerning the new
songstress is left in a much-divided state. Miss
Wray has certainly lost ground during the latter
half of tiie season. She made a decided hit in
“Madame Angot ” and in “Nitouche.” Then
she fell away considerably in “ Pinafore,” where
her Josephine was hopelessly eclipsed by that of
Mias Florence Young, whose voice is always
sweet and beautiful, and her acting good,
even if it falls short of actual brilliance. In the
“Mikado” Miss WTay’s Yiim-Ynin was accept-
able in many respects, yet the Katisba of Florence
Young decidedly overshadowed it. Opinion
concerning Miss Juliet is now in a dazed and
shattered condition, but the general idea is that
she can act a few parts well and a number of
others only moderately, and that her voice is not
wholly reliable, and, in short, that she is a lady of
possibilities who may become a very fine actress,
or only an erratic one. At present she is an un-
finished meteor.
* * * *
A dramatic season begins at the Lyceum
on Saturday, the first production being “ In Old
Kentucky,” which is now doing a triumphant
career in the Land of the Wooden Ham. Theco.
is a strong one, including Miss Helen Dauvray,
the well-known American actress ; these two
attract! ve and deservedly popular Australiennes,
Misses Harrie Ireland and Nelly Mortyne ; also,
King Hedley (he of the great horse-sensation at
Her Majesty’s), little Ivy Scott, D'Orsay Ogden,
Elton, Scot Inglis, and many others. Likewise,
there are a chorus of genuine nigger-boys ; five
trained racehorses, all winners at Rand wick ; an
intelligent mare which escapes from a blazing
stable with its mane and tail smouldering ; a big
explosion ; a horse-race ; and a lot of other sensa-
tions. Mr. George Darrell stage-manages, and
bets his immortal soul that “ Old Kentucky ” will
be a success.
* * * *
The Fitzgeralds’ show opened, as an-
nounced, at Sydney Exhibition Building, and
proceeded to live up to the high character which
The Bulletin gave it on its recent Melbourne
appearance. Mahomet, the Calculating Horse,
has probably read the notice of himself in this
paper, and he spreads himself on immense arith-
metical conundrums with the energy of an animal
who has a reputation to preserve. The horse
distinctly takes first place in popular estimation.
After him the public doesn’t quite know whether
it enthuses mostover the Roumanian beauty who
casts her plump and pleasing figure wildly from a
trapeze iu the topmost recesses of the building,
and comes down with 115 feet of back somersault
into the net, or the professor who does a similar
stupendous drop into the tank. The genuineness
of the professor is guaranteed by the water which
flies about 40 feet in every direction, but there are
signs that the Roumanian lady is likely to be the
favorite. The professor falls into the tank twice
—once tied up in a sack and once iu his ordinary
condition, and the Roumanian she-desperado
bounds from the roof twice—first forwards
and then backwards, so honors are even.
Perhaps if these two astounding persons
got up a competition and proceeded to drop
from the roof till further notice, the public
might be able after a while to decide which it likes
best. The Eclair brothers —particularly the big
brown brother who stands on his teeth on the end
of a stick while the green brother hovers around
and gives his moral support, do a quick, clever
performance; and Rose, the lady who skirt-dances
on top of a rolling globe, is abo above par and
nice-looking to boot. Altogether it is a bright
and novel show, and the management already
begins to call itself Fitz Gerald on the strength of
it.
* * *
Harry Plimmer now takes King Hedley’s
old billet at Her Majesty’s as the desperate rider
of the horse that falls into the stormy tank, and
Miss Lily Dampier assumes Miss Harrie Ireland’s
place as the wild girl of the plains in the deerskin
pants. Plimmer fills his new part quite as well
as his predecessor, but Miss Dampier is not by
any means an adequate successor for the hand-
some Harrie. She rides like a centaur, it is true,
and gallops across the biidge in excellent style,
but on foot, in the deerskin pants, she is some-
what disappointing. It is alleged that the ever-
welcome Alfred Dampier will shortly join the co.
at Her Majesty’s, and all Sydney will be pleased
to meet him once more.

The old, dusty Gaiety awoke on Saturday
night and called itself the Bijou, and attempted
to produce a deeply solemn drama entitled
“Is He Guilty?” with the aid. of a number
of people whom this paper doesn't remember
hearing of before. Said drama, which struck
the audience in four sickening thuds, proved to
be a hash of the Dean case and the other case
of the corpse that was lately found in a box
at Woolloomooloo. The Gaiety is not a cheerful
house nowadays. The seats have been replaced
by long rows of hard, wooden chairs, which make
it look like a Stiggins meeting-house. The
enclosure for the orchestra has been removed, anti
a small, mortified piano squats nakedly on the
floor like a toad at the edge of a 640-acre paddock.
The big gas-jet outside refused to burn on Satur-
day night, and at last a pallid hand turned it off
at the meter. There was a thin smattering of
audience. The curtain didn’t go up till 8.30, and
m the interval of waiting the gallery yelled indig-
nantly, “Gimme back me sprat ! ” and urged the
co. to get its ’air cut. The orchestra proved to
consist of only one man, who came out, with a
scared expression, just as sounds of breakage
began to be heard from upstairs, and tinkled a
few notes, and the gallery told him to pull down
his vest, and someone rang an angry cow-bell
behind the scenes, and the curtain arose and
revealed a bad apothecary who held a mortgage on
the farm, and insisted on the daughter becoming
his ’appy bride before he would part with it, and
a noble bank-clerk who came in and paid off the
mortgage. Then The Bulletin man left, and
someone in the gallery dropped a hunk of hard
gloom on bis head as he made his escape.
* * * *
The Rickards show at the Tivoli is as
bright as ever, and that old-time favorite of
Sydney chappiedom, Ali.ss AIIcb Leamar, is on hor
way out from England to lend it some additional
glory. Most people- will remember Miss Leamar
as the most thoroughly enthusiastic high-kicker
who ever struck these shores, and the owner of
the wickedest-looking dark eye ever turned on an
Australian gallery.
* * * *
Professor Kennedy woke up his trance-
patient on Saturday night, and then moved on to
other spheres of usefulness. The savages of
Botany Bay have much enjoyed his show, and
never stopped to inquire into the miserable after-
fate of the wretches who consumed onions, kero-
sene, colza oil, cayenne, salt, candle-ends, and
other masses of beastliness for their degraded
gratification. It is alleged on what seems to be
good authority that these individuals fall into a
horrible state of indigestion behind the curtain as
soon as the hypnotic influence is removed, and
retch dismally lor an hour or two, and wish that
they were dead. According to this theory, the
man who devours kerosene and candles while’in a
hypnotic state becomes, when the influence is re-
moved, just like any other man who consumes
these same masses of grease, so anyone who
wants to understand the full inwardness of the
show can do it by getting 20 friends together and
drinking the Kennedy variety of slush along with
them, and then letting them all wail and collapse
together in the scullery.

Concerning another mesmerist who once
visited Australia, it is related that when he left a
certain city four of his subjects—all men of about
30—remained behind in the hospital. Someone
asked the doctor in charge what was the nature of
their complaint. “Nothing but extreme old
age,” he replied, “nervous wreckage and break-
up of the system. They’re fit for nothing now
save an Old Men’s Home.” These are some of
the consequences of the “funny ” variety of mes-
merism.
* * * *
The Gaiety co. has but a little time left
to live at Melb. Princess’s. A revival of “In
Town” crowds the house until this (Thursday)
evening, for public faith in Brad field is almost as
strong as before, and the fame of Fred Kaye’s
callboy has grown on reflection, so to speak, whilst
one last lingering gaze at Florence Lloyd in a
brown sac suit is a joy that mustn’t be missed.
Moreover, Melbourne’s former idol, Ryley, as the
Duke, appears to advantage in this show. His
performance of the harmless, elderly chappie sug-
gests that he will grow old gracefully, and The
Bulletin herewith wishes Ryley a full restoration
to robust health, and a happy white-headed dis-
tant future, in addition to a comforting middle
age. Also, this journal begs to inflict its heart-
felt blessing upon the adorable Miss Decima and
several other ladies of the co. who are, more or
less, about to get married, or have no intention to
risk it. The editor has hired an emotional bank-
clerk to go dow n to the steamer appointed to carry
the co. hence, and tear his golden hair when the
anchor’s weighed. After which he will commit
suicide by tatooing the names “ Hobson and
Palotta ” upon his heart. Saturday noon is the
time appointed for this tragedy. Meantime, Brad-
field will have a farewell matinee (25th) in oppo-
sition to the arrival of Brassey, and the abso-
lutely final appearance of everybody (in a mixed
entertainment) will happen when the sun goes
down upon the great vice-regal grovel.
* * * #
For Saturday evening next Messrs. Wil-
liamson and Musgrove purpose a grand produc-
tion of Brassey, K.C.B. — his first appearance as a
Governor in any Melbourne theatre. Lord
Brassey's sitting down is to be preceded by the
National Anthem and a brilliant display of
enthusiasm, and “The Old Guard” will bring
“ the most important Amusement Function of the
year ” to a suitable conclusion. Mayor Poly-
dore’s career is a sermon on the vanity of human
greatness when a crisis arrives.
* * # *
“ Joseph of Canaan,” which has brought a
good deal of sanctified grist to the mill, retires
from the Royal after Friday. The author is
understood to be coming to Melbourne during the
week, therefore certain reverend peacemakers
have formed a conspiracy for the reconciliation of
Messrs, Rignold and Walters. Any misunder-
standing between these two twin producers of
“Joseph” is regretable, now that their angry
newspaper conflict has exhausted its usefulness as
an advt. The hand of Providence seemed to
direct it for a time. But the harvest has been
gathered in, and the reapers ought to bury the
scythe. Let them think of how Joseph forgave
his brethren, and remember Pharaoh’s clemency
to his enemies. If they can be persuaded to kneel
side by side in the temple of Osiris, or something
of that sort, they will doubtless reconcile at one
fell swoop, and then, in the burning words of
Mrs, Potiphar, love shall remain. “Man to
Man,” a melodrama in many acts and sensations,
is due on Saturday.

Harry Shine’s mellow cockney humor has
been added to the Rickards show at Melb. Opera
House, and that reliable establishment is still in
great demand, The little i.aiety Theatre re-
opened on Saturday with Larry Dooley and Frank
Clark at opposite corners, a tuneful variety pro-
gramme and the Calculating Boy. The infant in
question got his due meed of wonderment from
The Bulletin a while ago. His memory is still
a long way past all common understanding, and
the unexciting performance derives some interest
from the probability that one night he will lose his
duplicate brain and become like any other boy
who “cheeks” his father.
* * * *
“The Battle of Gettysburg” cyclorama,
formerly of Sydney, is now on view at the Mel-
bourne building, where “ Waterloo ” and “Jeru-
salem ” used to deceive the eye. “Gettysburg”
is not much the worse for wear. The Heavens
disclose a few creases, but otherwise it is quite as
convincing as in days of yore. Also, the lecture
retains its historical value, and the incident of the
gallant juvenile, who committed arson in free-
dom’s cause, and was subsequently slain whilst
plucking a flower from the roadside, comes in at
the old place as a warning to the young.
* * * *
The last nights of “ A Gaiety Girl ” gave a
very poor idea of the same show in its early b'oom.
For some unexplained reason, Maud Hobson
dn>pped out of her place on the Monday, and a
new Lady Virginia Forrest was introduced by
Florence Lloyd. Miss Lloyd shaped very well,
but she didn’t go as far as the more gorgeous
charmer. Her chief recommendation for the
character, perhaps, lay in the fact that she toned
down the glaring difference between Bradfield’s
fussy Dr. Briefly and Monkhouse’s weighty im-
personation. Hence the assumption that Brad-
field (who cut a very small figure in his
canoodlings with Maud Hobson) had possibly
effected this alteration in the bill. Since his “ In
Town ” success, Bradfield has been—well, like all
other performers of his class, who wallow in
the greasy adulation of soft-headed newspaper
“ critics.”
* * * *
Bradfield, like Lonneu before him, de-
clines in the estimation of the stalls and circle as
he becomes still more popular with the youngest
and noisiest of the gods. He has been singing, at
Melb. Princess’s, a puny, witless, topical song, set
to the sickest of music. This sore affliction was
actually glorified in the advts., on the strength of
“five encores” from about the same number of
howling asses, who would have howled 10 encores
if their elders hadn’t called for silence. Bradtield
evidently believed in the song himself. And the
football-barrackers believe in Bradfield. He
realises their conception of “a fair treat.”
At Poverty Point .
Dear Bulletin,— Complaint is justly made that Sydney
produces no vocalists worthy of the name. It isn't for
the want of good natural voices. Maybe the Sydney
dialect and our pronounctd nasal speech have something
to do with it. One well-known tenor (amateur) lat< ly
remarked to me: “There ain’t nobody in Sidney kin
learn me singhr. All yer've got ter do's to brealhe'from
yer stummick, watch yer time, ’nd prodooce yer notes
from the larnj x.” I suggested “ larynx." “ Well," he
rejoined, “you make it ‘laij’nx,’ and 1 make it ‘ lurnyx,’
’nd I'm goin’ ter stick ter larnyx, anywye. What could
Santley do with a man like that ?— Thorold W.
Flo. Esdaile, who will be first girl in Coppin’s Xmas
Panto., look her stage-name from the brand of piano on
which Mine. Lucy Chambers play ed when giving singing-
lessons. Miss E.-dade (who belongs to the Chosen) lived
next door to a theatre, and was always singing while at
her domestic duties, Her voice penetrated to next door,
and led to enqubies being made, and so to her first
engagement.
Negotiations with Maggie Moore having fallen through,
Coppin has engaged a London lady, Florae Wilton (first
appearance in Australia), for “ first boy.”
Saturday night in a Melb. theatre. Cackling theatre-
parly in U.c. Venlriloquial voice loud and clear; “Oh,
damn it all, give the actors a show!” Silence for re-
mainder of evening.
Harry Young, Florence’s brother, also a pro., is a musi-
cal eccentiic. He plays turns with his Hngeis on bis in-
flated cheeks, or on a coik held between bis teeth, on the
blade of a table-knife or pen-knife, or with a piece of
paling or a lead-pencil on the edge of a table. Likewise,
without instrumental aid of any kind, he can imitate the
banjo, flute, cornet, and baapip'S. Harry Young is said

son s) first teacher, when botli were Melb. amateurs.
Nat. Levi’s Noose (Melb.) called “Joseph of Canaan ” a
“ridiculous bur.esque" in tire first instance, and later
asserted that its “opinion” had been fully endoised by
the “ pub ic.” As a matter of tact, the Melb. people who
saw “Joseph’ were more or less surprised to find so
little of the ridiculous in the performance.
Maribel Greenwood s papa is said to have made another
fortune—from a gold-mine. Anyway, the devoted parent
is once again staging Ids wife and family in Maoriland.
Maribel, of course, figures as the star—the Bernhardt of
the family, to use their own expression—but the others
are only a little less brilliant. And such enthusiasts in

would peg away at music and the drama till they
dropped.
Maud Hobson has the wisdom of her defects. Her legs
are what is called “ a bit off,” and don't do credit to her
face and figure. la tights her legs are not so much “ a
sight for sore eyes,” as almost an eyesore. So Maud has
been photo’d, not in tights—she was 100 wise (or that—
but in baggy silk pants which hang gracefully from the
hips and make her look shapely and symmetrical.
Surely the matinee is not worked for all it is worth in
Melb. Hignold must needs have his “Joseph” matinee
on the same Wednesday afternoon as the Gaiety Co., and
both had good houses.
Juliet Flegeltaub Wray was some time ago about the
best lady amateur trick roller-skater. Sne won many
prizes ; but was beaten on One occasion by an outsider at
Richmond yMelb.) rink. The dark horse was a Miss
Michael, of the energetic Juliet’s own persuasion.
The leading part in a sort of operetta, for which
“ Banjo ” finds the book and Mr. Truman the music, and
which will be produced in Sydney shortly, will be sung
by a “novice,” a young Sydney Jewish lady.
Adelina Antonio, the tiapeze artist of Fitzgerald Bros.’
show, nearly pul an end to her career the other night at
Bendigo. Wiien she somersaulted fiom the dome of the
theatre into the net a rope support gave way, and let the
smiling Roumanian dcwn upon the chair-backs. She
seems to have escaped with an injury to one of her
beautifully-chiselled undeisiandings, and her funeral is
not yet, The Bulletin rejoices to mention. Adelina’s
trapeze-work is the poetry of gymnastics.
Nat. Levi's weak and struggling Melb. Evening News
has just experienced a mild form of gag. The gallant
little rag spake its mind pretty freely over some of the
Gaiety pieces, and in particular about Bradfleld’s ditty,
“She wanted something to play with.” Result: Every
member of the Noosb staff has been knocked off the Prin-
cess’ free-list.
Theatrical definition of “scurrility”; That quality in

Bradfield is even vainer than most proa. He pays
periodical visits to shops having bis photo, to ascertain
the daily sale. “ Another two dozen gone off 10-day,” is
the main topic of his conversation behind the scenes.
Coddy boasts that his phiz lias topped the photo.-selling
record of the co. Coddy, by the way, bought a new

Dear B., —The two “Hopes” of the Gee Gees are not
“related to lord Hopeloun,” as per several “Hawl

real name Lee. For “Cecil” read “ Walker” (no slang),
and for “array” read” militia.” Democratic com-
munities always gush over the military aristocracy.
—Philistine.
Bradfield’s lack of spontaneous humor in “Gentleman
Joe” and other parts is testified to by everybody who
has seen Arthur Roberts. Roland Cunningham; of Melb.
Lyric Cluo renown, now playing with Roberts, writes out
that A.R. gags so much and so differently every night
that the poor mummers in the co. simply have to stand
round to smile. They never know when he has finished.
When Cunningham made his first appearance Roberts
had just reformd from France, where he had met some
of tlie Melb. tenor s friends, and when he came on to the
stage he started telling him before the audience all the
funny stories lie had heard from the aforesaid friends.
A benefit is mooted in Melb. for the popular and gifted
Madame Majeroni, who has lately suffered in Health and
ortune.
A benefit is being arranged at Melbourne for Tom
Robbins, who was scenic-artist at I lie “Old Ironpot”

Henry Howe went across to New York the other week
with Irving’s company. The old man has turned his 80th
year, and is still full of running. A4O y ears’ engagement
at one theatre, the Haymarket, made an actor s life very
smooth and healthful for Howe, who will probably walk
the boards till he dies of natural decay.
Widow Maud Hobson has a sou, being educated in

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback — the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

the bygone days of Victorian luxury, the subsequent
reactionary modesty, or will they strike the “golden

prevail, the lawn on Cup-day will be radiant with
fair Women whose charms are enhanced by their
sartorial settings. Head-dresses will be unusually
bright this season, and Messrs. Manning and Co.

A PUZZLE.
Readers of The Bulletin in the country are often
puzzled to know where to send their orders, so
many drapery firms are advertising what they can
do, but few care much how orders are executed.
There seems to be a general idea that “anything
will do for the bush,” all forgetful of the fact that
ladies, even in the remotest backblocks, like to
have the latest styles and the freshest of goods.
Messrs. Riley Brothers, of 570 George-st., Sydney,
have for the past 30 years given special attention
to their Country Order Department, and know
intimately the requirements of every part of the
colony—North, South, or West. If the lady

The most emphatic literary success
achieved by any Australian in London during this
last 15 years was scored by Louis Becke with
“13y Reef and Palm” —his series of charming
South Sea stories reprinted from The Bulletin :
and now Mr. Arthur Barton Paterson (“ Banjo,’
of The Bulletin) has made, in his own country
and province, a record among Australian verse-
writers. Last Saturday morning, Messrs. Angus
and Robertson published about 1000 copies of
“The Man from Snowy River, and other verses ”
(chiefly from The Bulletin), which, to the very
last copy, were at once taken up by the Sydney
retail trade. No five-shilling book issued
south of the Equator has ever had such a recep-
tion. A second edition is now in the press, and
will be published on Monday.

Melbourne JEn Fete .
Melbourne folks look forward to their wonderful
Cup day as the greatest annual festival'in the
universe. Everybody, from the Governor to the
shoeblack, goes to Flemington that day, with the
exception of the burglar, who stays behind to reap
a harvest. The reason that everybody goes is that
admission to the flat is free ; if the customary
bob was demanded, many in that wonderful city
of smells would have to stay at home. Although
Melbourne abounds in paupers and blacklegs, she
also has her select and wealthy citizens, vyho
make the lawn and grand-stand on the First
Tuesday in November a perfect picture, and visi-
tors from the neighbouring colonies assist in the
events of the greatest day in. the Southern Hemi-
sphere. Visitors to Melbourne are advised to
take with them a supply of the famous B.L.
Corto Rothschild Cigars, which are the most deli-
cious smoke for (5d. the world has ever produced,
and no better cigar for the money will ever be
procured. The B.L. Cotto Rothschilds are
obtainable from all first-class tobacconists for 6d.*

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
October 22, 1895.
My Dear Moorabinda—
Miss Aimis Montague's complimentary farewell
matinee, at Sydney Lyceum, last Monday, was
enough of a success to somewhat palliate the self-
advertising fuss of some of those concerned in its
promotion. Society was there in large numbers,
and the programme was the usual improbable
matinee mixture. “Pinafore” started it (with
Flo. Young as a melodious, sympathetic Jose-
phine), and the prison-scene from “ Trovatore,” in
which Sydney gazed for probably the last time
on Annis Montague’s shapely white arms and
hands —rang down the final curtain. In between,
the saddest item was, of course, the presentation
of an address and a necklace to Mrs. Turner—ex-
Mayor Manning spokesman. The visible misery
of these happiest moments in people’s lives makes
sensitive individuals glad when the ordeal is over.
Such things always remind me of the finish of a
hare-hunt —caught at last, and no getting away.
I must say that pretty, baby-faced Mrs. Turner,
whom Australia will ever remember as a true
artiste and a charming woman —by the pleased
simplicity of her manner, took a lot of the usual
rawness out of the thing. She was enthusiastically
bouqueted.
At the Montague matinee, by the way, occurred
that rara avis, a Sydney girl with a pretty voice
—one with very much the quality of Flo. Young's
flexible and sweet mezzo-soprano —added to which
she had a calm and self-possessed stage manner
quite devoid of the aggressive self-assurance
which so often marks otherwise meritorious
amateurs. Miss Hetty Holroyd’s item, well sung
and well “deported,’’ was a very pleasant thing,
and the public will want to hear more of her.
Maud FitzStubbs’s latest composition, “ Ave
Maria,’’ a study on a Czerny’s “ velocity,” has
been sung by Melba, who will take it with her
during her next American tour. With a sacred-
sounding vocal air, and violin and organ obligati,
the “ Ave Maria ” is a success on novel lines—
and certainly some pianoforte exercises are only
instruments of torture, because they are exercises.
If people took the trouble to fit song-music and
words to them they would, some of them, be
absolutely charming. Another song recently re-
ceived is “My Wish,” words by Lester Belling-
ham, the music by Oissie Naylor. Ihe best
thing one can say of this song is that words and
music are a beautiful fit. The halting mediocrity
of the one is faithfully mirrored in the other.
One day last week Madame Lucien Henry suc-
cessfully petitioned for a divorce from her hus-
band, the Judge being extremely sympathetic in
summing-up in her favor. After the case con-
cluded, Madame received the congratulations of
her many friends that at last the legal business
was over and a most unfortunate and painful
matter definitely arranged.
A brace of no-English-savee officers off one of
the French boats had an embarrassing experience
the other day in a fashionable Sydney drapery,
whither they went to purchase (in view of a Guv-
mentouse function) dress shirts with those bands
of insertion down the front so dear to the orna-
mental nature of the dapper Gaul, Arrived at
the rag-shop, they informed the obsequious shop-
walker that they wanted “ des chemises,” and
although French is taught for tuppence a week
in Australian State-schools, the “ Mr. Higgles ”
in question thought they required the usual
English article wiiich goes by that name—espe-
cially as they were keen about having “embroi-
dery,” and so sent them on with a flourish into
the ladies’-underclothing department, where a
blushing shop-girl awaited them.
" Some chemises ? Yes, sir!” and in a twink-
ling a box was on the counter full of fluffy, be-
ribboned, be-ruffied garments. “I am sure the
lady will like these,” said the shop-girl confiden-
tially, thinking she scented a marriage in the air.
But the blushing foreigners hastened to explain in
lightning pantomime that it was not what they
sought—they wanted “chemise pour ze night—
wiz embroidery vous savez,” and they drew
imaginary lines of insertion up and down their
manly chests to show the length of the fronts.
Then a new clue occurred to the girl, and she re-
turned with an armful of the most dainty, la.cy,
fairy-like night-dresses mortal woman could wish.
This last straw reduced Johnny Crapaud to
despair—the pantomime became violent, they tore
at their own collars, they shot their cuffs, they
waltzed with much by-play, to infer that a ball
was on the carpet and they wanted shirts tb wear
to it, while the sales-lady stood looking on wonder-
ing where they had escaped from. At this critical
juncture a Sydney woman who parley-voos and
who was shopping near by reckoned it would be a
Christian act to interfere and set things straight.
Talking about shirts, I hear that hand-painted
fronts are the latest caper for Johnniedom at
’Ome. They run in all patterns. 'One had a
trail of forget me-nots ; another was peppered with
pink roses; another had a flight of exquisitely-
painted butterflies, though their chielest charm
is their expensivenesa, “ for it all comes out in the
washing.” I don’t blame—well, I won’t say men,
but dudes—for trimming themselves thus. Even a
Johnnie can’t stand being dressed like his con-
temporary woman, and now that Eve has taken
his collar and tie, his cut-away coat, his cropped
hair and eke his breeks, Adam, in self-defence, if
he wishes to preserve Ins masculine individuality,
must cultivate a curly bang, a painted shirt and
crimson socks to prevent the sexes becoming
sartorially equal at least.
The wall-paper dickey hasn’t yet got to Aus-
tralia, though ’Ampden may bring one or two
with [lira. Sydney’s new and Gov. looks, on
paper, just the sort of man to have vicit us-look-
ing red roses climbing all over his chest when in
full fig. But, so far, the nearest approach to
fancy linen in Australia is the pink shirt with the
white collar, which always looks to me as if the
wearer was warming into life from the shirt up-
wards, like the Pygmalion story upside-down.
And —if 1 may still blushingly allude to the fashion
in shirts—l hear that they are now made like unto
a woman’s blouse, with most of the tails cut off,
which is a sensible plan, considering that men
don’t want width round the hips. The sexes will
never be equal in figure, for while a woman is in
despair if she isn’t shaped like an egg, a man
gives up all hopes of doing justice to his tailor
unless his figure somewhat resembles a capital T.
I have just discovered that the weird ghost
story which appeared in my letter of the week
before last was not original after all. The person
who told it to me as a perfectly new and hair-
raising experience either got it out of Sckibnkk’s
and remorselessly took in a lone scribe with
his second-hand yarn, or else the same awesome
incident has happened to two people, or possibly
more. Therefore, either the spectre or the man
was a plagiarist, and they can settle, the matter
between them. In future, however, lam going to
invent my own ghost stories, as the only method
of insuring absolute novelty combined with the
necessary blood-curdlingness, and any spook who
gibbers in this column hereafter will lie new, even
if he isn’t authentic. A spook doesn’t need to oo
authentic, anyhow.
N.S.W. Art Society is in luck, the late Mr.
Richard Wynne having left .£lOOO to provide
annually “the Wynne art-prize” for the Aus-
tralian artist producing the best landscape paint-
ing of Australian scenery. This will probably
mean a prize worth about .£33 per annum, and
will lead to the gum-trees getting a greater gruel-
ling than they have ever got before. Talking art
—the split in the N.S.W. camp continues to yawn,
and, as one consequence of it, the Art Society pro-
poses to part company with its capable teacher,
Mr. Julian Ashton.
The late Mr. John Hore, a border pioneer, who
died at St. Hilda the other day, left behind him
.£250,000 discreetly and justly apportioned.
Nobody who had any claim on the testator was
deliberately left out, and in case the grandchild
of a cousin fourteen times removed might have
been overlooked w hen the will was drawn up the
family residence and land at St. Hilda are to be
sold and the proceeds divided among relatives
who may have been forgotten. Ihere were no
charitable or religious bequests—the old pioneer
evidently believed in charity getting a fair start
at home. The only thing the church got out of
it was .£25 for the clergyman who read the burial
service.
Sydney must be populated by ghouls, w else
one wouldn’t read that “so much trouble is being
caused by the attendance of such large crowds to
see the man in the trance, that Professor Kennedy
made it known that to-morrow every person
wishing to ‘ view the body ’ ( ) will have to pay a
toll of sixpence.” Imagine the sort of vampire
who would pay sixpence to look at wh it is to all
intents and purposes a corpse! If such a
grisly show goes at sixpence a head, it strikes me
that a brilliant source of revenue is wasted by not
charging admission to the morgue, to hangings,
hospital-operations, accidents, and corpses in
general. Also, lectures on body-snatching with
gore-colored diagrams would probably make a hit.
To scientific people all horrors are open, of course,
but that the unscientific should enjoy gloating on
a living corpse, with no comprehension of the why
and wherefore, looks as if the evening papers had
at last accomplished their obvious task.
Fitzgerald Brothers’New London Company (the
circus is resting on a Maorjland farm) opened to
very cheerful business at Sydney Exhibition
Building on Saturday evening. The principal
feature of the huge audience was the absence of
bald-headed men, though the roseate vision of
Miss Adeline Antonio, with pale pink shapely
legs and a peg-top suit of pink-and-silver striped
satin as she appeared hanging from the daring
trapeze, ought to make bald-heads as common as
cobble-stones at the show. Miss Antonio must
have an iron nerve as well as hard muscles to drop
115 ft., and turn two back somersaults en route,
without breaking her neck or even relaxing her
pleasant smile. The other girl is La Belle Rose,
the swirl-danoer. Typically, I suppose, of the
grasp the graceful serpentine has over the whole-
world, La Belle Rose swirls her silvery draperies
on top of a globe. And she sent that sphere roll-
ing while she was making hay with her diaphon-
ous skirts, on which were thrown various colored
designs (I liked the pale-blue with silver stars
effect), culminating in political portraits. Of these
widower Parkes mingled best with the silvery
draperies—his long, white hair looked like flying
chiffon. And, apropos of portraits thrown on
dancers’ clothing—l wonder how that Tivoli dan-
seuse likes to remember how George Dean’s pic-
ture used to be flashed on her petticoats night
after night ?
La Belle Rose’s handsomest dress was a hand-
painted satin painted by herself on the voyage
out-butaltogether thenewLondono qmpanv make
a richly-dressed aggregate who wear different
clothes every niglit and won’t look at a pair or
baggy tights. The two Alton*, in black, scarlet,
and silver, suggested a couple of very spruce
birds as they hung on to the empyrean by one
eyelash, and Prof. Peart was a gloss of satin and
glimmer of pearls as lie dived from the roof. My
firm idea re the new London show is that most of
the members must be descended from the people
who supply the dark side of the plot in “ Paradise
Lost”—they fall from astonishing heights in such
a graceful and accustomed manner.
The greatest star of the “ Fitz ” show is, of
course, Mahomet, the educated horse. He is a
black, with two white hind-feet and a white star,
and is a beautifully-shaped and well-groomed
animal. His public performance is unique y
marvellous, and he is even cleverer in his stall v\ i i
nobody looking—which argues a lack of conceit on
the gee-gee’s part. 1 was permitted to call upon
Mahomet, the other morning, and was introduced
by Mr. Prohasco, his ’Murkan trainer. Mahomet
was observed to lie very cross about something,
and when asked if everything was correct
vehemently signified that it was not and no
until Mr. Prohasco removed his glossy silk hat
did the educated equine nod his head and look
amiable. Hats off indoors is Mahomet s idea or
good form. When asked how many ladies had
come to see him he knocked once with his hoot.
He not only answers the trainer’s questions, but
graciously replies to the most idiotic observations
of perfect strangers, and also adds up sums whic i
the persons who supply the figures probably
couldn’t compute as he does off-hand. At part-
ing he condescended to kiss me in the most
patronising way, and then the stable-door vvas
carefully shut and padlocked on the most interest-
ing horse it has ever been my good fortune to
meet.

To-night (Thursday) the Royal Comic Opera
Co. fold up their grease-paint, roll their crape
hair and get things ship-shape prior to their
departure for Melbourne on Friday’s express
ready to open in Cupopplis on Saturday. “The
Mikado” was played on their last Saturday in
Sydney (fur the present) with Juliet Wray as
Yum Yum. By the way, when Miss W. played
the role in Brisbane and came to the dialogue
line, “ Yes, I am indeed beautiful,” a connoisseur
in Olympus scornfully ejaculated, “Kiddum!”
Flo. Young renewed her Katisha success. The
tuneful versatility of Florence may lead to her
starring as a double-voiced vocalist some day.
Josephine one evening, and Katisha the next—
soprano and contralto almostinone breath —argues
a most accommodating vocal range. Wallace
Brownlovv made the Mikado a cold-blooded, pierc-
ing potentate in black and gold, although an
adoring circle prefers its Brownlow not quite so
decayed in gait and make-up, and Vernon was, as
usual, grateful and comforting as Ko-Ko. What
a lovely tea-gown his dress would make!
The co. farewells to-night (Thursday), after a
good season, in acts from different operas just to
give the dresses and scenery an airing and shake
the moths out before packing up, I suppose ; for
certainly mixed bills are not the best
Audiences prefer their stage-plays “ straight ”
except, perhaps, when they are suffering a
matinee. The new operetta, which the co. is at
present getting into shape, is a very Frenchy
thing, yclept “ Cousin-Cousine,” wherein Latin,
I believe, spends two acts in a wild search after
his garments which he sheds in the perfectly inno-
cent but compromising manner peculiar to the
French. Brownlow is a dashing militaire, and
Flo Young plays the prima-donna part, which in-
cludes one rattling good song at least.
The renowned cyclist Zimmerman may not, in
Australia, prove to be the Zim. of old, the un-
married flyer who: beat three continents. The
cares of matrimony, I am told by an athlete lately
back from Adelaide, are taking the hum out of
Zim.’s wheel, and there need be no surprise if bis
star wanes in Australia, for lie promises to sprint
this trip on a buckled wheel —which comes of
taking two on a racing machine. The “ Daisy
B •!! ” theory is meant only for the honeymoon.
When Zim. got married liis wife said, “Arthur
is not going to race any more.” Which threatens
to be true, if read literally.
Passing through the lamp-lit corridors of Hyde
Park, Sydney, one’s attention is constantly
arrested by the attitudes of the cooing couples
with whom the park seats are ever profusely
adorned. It is interesting to notice that, in
nearly every case, the swain is the caressed —she
the oaresser. He, albeit spread generously in her
abundant embrace, takes his bliss complacently,
and appears to respond but diffidently to het
luxuriant fondling and general yearn, while the
nymph, as well as monopolising the emotion,
seems to supply the greater portion of fuel con-
versationally. Why is this? Are woman’s modest
mien and timid tongue a vain dream of daylight,
dispelled when the shades of dusk screen her from
the observation of captious critics, and is it coy
man that is decoyed, after all? I want to know.
I think the vessel which bears a large
theatrical company to fresh fields and pastures
new ought always to be called Ivoah’s Ark. There
is something so reminiscent of the animals which
went in two by two in the proceedings of Thespians
cn toute ; at least, if they don’t go in double-
banked they certainly come out that way.
Talking of the “ stige several recentlyrim-
ported and fatally-fascinating lie-actors do not
sport their natural wool but sail under wigs.
Such cute little wigs they are, too, that these
grease-paint Adonises have actually been getting
the adoration of women and the gnawing envy of
the men—especially those with a little bald spot
on top—for their “pretty hair,” as Lauri says.
But really a wig isn’t half a bad idea for foreign
mummers down “ under ” this season. Summer
is coming, and the Australian mosquito is.a fieice
and indefatigable animal, especially when he
smells lime-juice. These artificial Samsons will,
therefore, be well-advised if they glue, nail-tack,
or screw down their wigs to the very uttermost.
One of them, indeed, does keep his hair on very
desperately, but another occasionally takes off hie
ambrosial locks and waves ’em at people.
One entertainment offered to a certain frisky
theatrical co. will never be forgotten by either
guests or hosts. The latter, man-like, wished tc
make one happy family of the ladies with golden
hair a-hanging down their backs (in a manner of
speaking) and their own lady friends, quite a la
the Major’s garden-party in the “ Gaiety Qirl,”
so they boldly sent out cards —Lady Snooks to
meet Gold wash and vice versa. When the day
came behold the friskers turned out in full force,
but nary a society petticoat darkened the gate 1
Nothing occurred to save the situation, either,
except the enthusiastic manner in which every
man explained to every lady how his aunt or
grandmother (as the case might be) had beeji sud-
denly attacked with influenza or beri-beri only
that very morning. It was charming, I am told,
to hear how solemnly they tarradiddled to save
the cast-iron sensibilities of their gaudily-dressed
visi tresses.
My Melb. correspondent writes : —
“ So far as the animals were concerned, the
( recent parliamentary visit to Melb. Zoo was pro-
ductive of little pleasure. Presumably on the
strength of the animal-maintenance vote, many
members swaggered about the gardens with an air
of proprietorship, shying gravel and small pebbles
at the sleepy carnivora, teasing the monkeys, and
altogether frisking in a way which, if emulated by
a nobody, would precipitate a collision with the
officials. The lion, at no time a respecter of
persons, snoozed on persistently, despite the par-
liamentary tactics aforesaid, until the society’s
director twisted his tail and roused him to a
sense of his duty to the powers that be. The
tigers, in their turn, promptly lost their tempers
when poked up with a stick, and from then until
feeding-time the place resounded with the com-
plaints of badgered brutes, denied the poor privi-
lege of forgetting their hunger in sleep, and with
appetites whetted to ravening point by the
presence, almost within reach, of so many juicy
legislators.
“Last summer, winter, and the current season
all had their champions, sartorially speaking,
among the lady-visitors, who, as far as possible,
basked exclusively in the rays of their respective
hubbies, only inspecting the other Parliamentary
women from a distance like the rest of the ani-
mals. A massive military dame in sheeuy-greeny-
grey alpaca coat, skirt, parasol, and one of her
historic hats —the one with the lilac-tree, &e.—
was an impressive contrast to a diminutive poli-
tical person with tight curls all over her cropped
head and a lining of faded purple to her garment
of crushed grenadine ; while a florid damsel, in a
flame-colored silk blouse which attracted the sun’s
rays like a burning-glass, would have looked even
more like a pillar of fire than she did but for the
eooling proximity of a tall, fair-haired, dark-eyed

The fact that Taverner, the Yic. Minister
who looks after the butter industry, is entrusted
with the Brassey reception arrangements is a fine
example of the fitness of things. The Brassey
reception is the largest butter problem Victoria
has yet met with.
• # *
Brassey’s arrival makes The Bulletin
feel quite sorry for Acting-Gov. Madden—the
man who has done his duty by his office by making
it do its duty by him. He has made more capital
out of his position than could have been believed
possible. And, what was stranger still, loyal Vic-
toria was beginning to kiss the hem of his trousers
as if he were himported Hinglish',' after all.
* * #
A touching sight on the first night of the
revival of “The Gaiety Girl,” at Melbourne
Princess’s, was the rival gubernatorial parties in
opposing stage boxes ; the Madden crowd on the
left, the Earl of Shaftesbury, Freeman Thomas,
Wallington, and ladies, on the right, and all
glasses on the latter box of tricks. It reminded
one touchingly of the domestic sorrows of the
family of John Ebenezer Firkins, the ex-Mayor
of London, as told by Hook in “Gilbert Gurney,”
* * m
Vic. Gov. Madden and suite spent two
solid hours the other day at Melbourne Treasury
awaiting the official visit of the Italian prince who
arrived per warship Christoforo Colombo. But
evidently a girl on the Block or some other
weighty attraction had crossed the princely path,
and, after swinging his legs for the time afore-
mentioned, the C. J. packed up his traps and went
home.
• mm
The Vic. Govt., in its exceeding worm-
someness, proposed giving Brassey four salutes of
17 guns, whereupon a proportionately solemn in-
dividual looked up the Imperial regulations
appertaining to the exploding of gigantic fire-
works and things when Governors move round,
and warned the Premier through the Argus that
Brassey is only entitled to two salutes. The
inference con veyed to Victoria’s trembling Govern-
ment is that something will happen to the
Empire and the local constitution will get kinks
in it; if more than 34 guns are fired by accident or
design on the landing of the new gubernator.

“And,” adds the writer with inhuman gravity,
“ I am quite sure that Lord Brassey is much too
loyal a subject of the Queen and too good a sailor
and yachtsman to desire more.” The difficulty of
sticking to the etiquette of fireworks, and yet
giving Brassey all the explosions his soul may
yearn for is bound to lie heavily on Premier
Turner’s chest till the great function is over.
The Brassey reception arrangements pro-
vide for the multi - millionaire being stuck up
between St. Kilda and Melb. by four mayors in
succession. Lucky that he lands just as the
mayoral allowances for the year are granted. In
some other Australian municipalities the mayoral
chains would, even at this early date, have to be
taken “ out of soak” by public subscription before
their worships could appear “with ’em all on.”
• » •
A number of exiled Australians met
Brassey at Cape Town, and gravely assured him
that he was doing an honor to Victoria by accept-
ing the governorship of that province. They
might also have mentioned that he was doing a
great honor to the earth by being on it at all.
Meanwhile it is a solemn reflection that when
Brassey pegs out the honorable worm will do itself
the honor to eat him just like anybody else, and
probably the only remark it will make is that he is
beastly tough. After all, the worm is the only
genuine democrat.
* * *
The Brassey grovel will yet result in
murder being done in Melbourne. The latest is
that Gurr, M.L.A., accuses Premier Turner of
poisoning his Ex.’s mind—by cable, no doubt —
against Geelong, and preventing him landing at
that sad and sleepy town. There is no evidence
in the matter save that Brassey isn’t going to land
at Geelong, but Gurr assumes that a natural de-
sire to land at Geelong is implanted in the human
breast, and the fact that Brassey isn’t going to
land there is therefore sufficient evidence that his
mind has been poisoned. So Gurr demanded
in the House that Turner should cable to
Brassey, and assure him that all objections to his
landing at Geelong have been removed. But
Turner only sat and stared at Gurr with an un-
seeing eye, and, in consequence, Gurr will pro-
bably vote against the Government for the future.

The Melb. Y.M.C.A. grovellers who went

smack in the eye from the worshipped one himself.
While the young Christians were raking in the
grovelsome guineas, Brassey wired that he would

A deep note of grovel is struck by Melb.
Herald in publishing a sketch of an ugly infant,
alleged to be “the Honorable Helen de Vere

one of the old Herald pictures of the infants mur-

The Bulletin this week prints a new and
excellent portrait by Kerry of Julian Salomons,
Q.O. Many likenesses of that acute and well-
advertised counsel have been circulated, but the
one now printed is perhaps more like its original
than any other which The Bjjlletin remembers
to have seen. The Q.C. is now on his way to
Europe in the Arcadia, and purposes resting
awhile in the South of France.
Day nurses in Melb.
Hospital have to work 72
hours a week including Sun-
days, while night-nurses go on
at 9 p.m. each evening and off
at seven each morning, thus

seven 10-hour stretches. And
such is “ sweating ” for sweet

There is a society of
ladies in Melbourne, the great
object of which is “to en-
courage a spirit of helpful-
ness, and a practice of kindly
speech,” and it calls itself
“ The Order of the Daughters
of the Court,” and announces
meetings of “Ye High Dame
and members of ye High
Court of ye Order of ye
Daughters of ye Court,” and
the members wear an insignia
that is a “real duck,” and
address each other in awful,
ancient gibberish, and carry
on in an idiotic manner gener-
ally. Which shows that the
painful, ape-like yearning of
the Mason, and the Oddfellow,
and the Druid, to wrap them-
selves round with gaudy rags
and tinkling symbols, and be
called Almighty Grand High
Bullyboy with the Glass-eye,
is not peculiar to man, but ex-
tends to woman also. There-
fore, she makes her deter-
mination not to call Mrs.
Brown over the way an old
cat, or her resolution to give
poverty-stricken widow Smith
a tract on the wickedness of
profligate living every day, an
excuse for calling herself a
High Dame, and going in for
the gaudy tomfoolery of an
Order. Good old advt. !

your wagon to a star.” Melbourne grovellers’

The telegraphic-monopolistic combination
among Australian papers doesn’t promise a long
life. The two columns of special hogwash wired
from Albany by the Argus special about “Baby”
Brassey and “ Sybil ” (it was repeated to the S. M.
Herald) has made bad blood between Argus and
Age. Little occurrences of this sort, and the
awful sameness of the cable news, will lead to a
new rag with independent services ohipping-in
before long.
It now seems unlikely that the threatened new

It would be well if the Australian clergy,
in their supplications for rain, would kindly
specify, for the benefit of the Almighty, the exact
amount of water they require. At present they
leave things so miserably indefinite that the
downpour varies from a Murrumbidgee shower,
four drops to the acre, to a ’9l deluge washing
half of the seaboard into the Pacific. If the par-
sons would but draw up a table of requirements
for various districts such as : “Bourke, one inch ;
Diamantina, 2|in., &c., &c., &c.,” and then pray,
“Send down, O Lord, rain according to above-
mentioned schedule! ” we should perhaps attain
something like satisfactory results. At present
they cure a drought by bringing a flood to the in-
dignation of two-thirds of the community.

The handsome giant, Placke, who came
to such grief in a prize-fight, has now been
a month in Sydney hospital, and his best day,
recently, found him still a little dazed and quite
inundated with lady visitors. Wien Placke’s
life was in the balance the leading surgical talent
of Sydney evinced the keenest interest in his case ;
now that he is getting better the women are taking
a hand. One nice girl came to the poor Dutchman
and read him a little sermon on the text of “ Birds
in their little nests agree” (Placke stands Gft.
sJin., and there wasn’t a bed in the hospital long
enough for him). Another girl called him “poor
dear,” and another “ poor boy.”
# * #
Hospital authorities, especially those “in
a large way,” should l>e somewhat cosmopolitan in
their attainments. The other day it was reported
of pugilist Placke that he awi ke from his stupor
and uttered a number of sounds, but that it could
not be discovered whether he was incoherently
raving or asking sensible questions in his own
language. Instances of such a kind are frequent
in small hospitals in remote localities, but they
should not occur in a seaport town the size of
Sydney.

“For the title ‘Agent-General,’” writes
an Anglo-Australian to Thk Bulletin, “ please
read ‘ Commission-Agent-Genera).’ An Agent-
General is a combination of head clerk, tourists’
guide, general factotum, petty ambassador, and
various other things. This department is a kind
of information-bureau, a colonists’ club, an
inquiry office, and a resort for the distressed.
Enrolment in its books is also a sure passport to
the distinguished society of the ex-Governors,
retired colonial politicians, pensioners, and per-
sons with various alphabetical appendices, whose
head-quarters are the Imperial and the Royal
Colonial Institutes. An obscure visitor from the
back-blocks, a J.P. from Swagville, a mayor from
Gum Town or member of the Shark Bay Harbor
Board, who aspires to bask for a space in the
society of pinchbeck aristocracy, and to return to
his colonial home covered with glory and a West
End rig out, must get the ‘open sesame’ from the
Agent-General.”

At the Prince of Wales’s levees uniform or
Court-dress is de rigueur. It is usual, however,
for Australians in London, who seek after the
bubble reputation, to hire a Court-dress at a cost
of five guineas from a certain swell Regent-street
pawn-shop. The full rig-out costs about .£3O, in-
oludingeoat, vest, knee-breeches, &c., but wealthy
colonists, who want to do the thing “ regardless,”
pay a big price for diamond buttons.

able miscarriage of justice in the matter of Mrs.
Butler, think the case one highly deserving of out-
side help, and have sent to The Bulletin, per
Mr. W. Campbell, a cheque for .£4 125., which
Mrs. Butler can have on application at this office.

A “ kommers’" night at Melb.
Turn-Verein is an experience. There is
good music, beer and—more beer. Per-
fervid Deutschers, with astonishing hair,
spring on the tables, and orate from op-
posite ends of the hall on the guest of
the evening. When the torrent of gut-
turals has ceased all glasses are filled,
waved about with diabolically mysterious
gestures, and then half-emptied to the
terrific cry of wassail. Then follows a
chorus and the glasses are emptied in one
simultaneous gulp and held up for proof ;
then brought down with a thundering
clatter on the tables, which concludes the
ceremony. The night given to Kruse
commenced on Thursday, and some kept
it up till mid-day on Saturday. A pro-
minent member explained how it was
done. It appears that whenever a Turn-
Vereiner feels the lager overpowering he
does not go home and beat his wife like
an Englishman, or throw stones at a
Chinaman like an Australian—he simply
retires into the adjoining gymnasium.
There half-an-hour on the parallel-bars
and trapeze sobers him up, and he comes
back well strung for more.

“ Sonny,” said a Yankee wool-
buyer to an Australian who shared the
same berth with him on the voyage
between Liverpool and “Neyork,’’ ‘‘you
ain’t no Englishman ; you’re an Austra-
lian ; that’s what you are, and don’t you
forget.” The Australian acted on that
advice and had a good time in the
States. “Where d’ye hail from?”
“Australia.” “Oh, I guess that’s a
live democratic country. What’s your
poison ? ”
Editor Bulletin, —Be the “Social Can-
cer.” You place all the blame as regards abor-
tion on the attitude of society towards the erring
spinster : she must, to avoid social disgrace, rid
herself of her incubus. No doubt true, as far as
it goes, but my experience is that married women
are far and away the worst offenders. Here the
question of social disgrace cannot enter, except in
cases too rare for computation. I have had ex-
ceptional opportunities for coming to a conclusion,
and were the abortionists to depend on spinsters
they would not exist financially for a month. A
most serious matter for the community is the way
that women are shirking their duties and functions
as mothers. The women who peopled Aus-
tralia in the fifties and sixties had their families
of five or six as an average, and were all the better
women for it. Women’s function is to bear
children ; hence the proper exercise of that func-
tion tends to mental, moral and physical develop-
ment. The abrogation or suppression of that
function must result in individual and eventually
in general degeneration. (Note the increase of

N.S.W. Aborigines’ Protection Board has
decided to appeal, if necessary, to the Supreme
Court for a definition of what legally constitutes
an aboriginal—the lower courts having determined
that under the Licensing Act a half-caste is not an
aboriginal. There are several things which an
aboriginal may legally do and which others may
not do, and vice versa ; and as half-castes arc
aboriginals under certain Acts and pronounced
not to be aboriginals under others, they are likely,
failing a definite settlement of the matter, to be

At last the man of science lowered himself out of
the window into the street, and when the angry hus-
band did get in he found his spouse in tears-and
that was about all. Hubby has now rented an
office close to the masseur, and sits outside his
office all day and sleeps on the masseur’s doormat
all night—the alleged reason for this being that
his wife forget to pay the masseur for treating
her, and he wants to settle up. But, up to date,
that masseur has not returned.

At a recent M.L. weddipg the bride hesi-

At Bendigo, last week, a young woman who
had cut her throat because she was falsely accused
of theft was brought up for sentence, and Judge
Holroyd decided that, according to law, he must
order her to be executed. After looking up pre-
cedents, however, he decided that, though she had
to be nominally executed, he had power to let the
prisoner out on the probation system, so she was
released on giving her own recognisances to come
up and be hanged when called upon. If she
doesn’t come up and be hanged when called upon
her recognisances will be forfeited, which will be
a truly dreadful thing, and the prospect of it is
calculated to make any girl turn up in good time
for execution. Altogether, this particular prisoner
lias had a depressing time. She was falsely charged
with theft in the first place, and then after having
a large gash in her throat, and undergoing a slow
process of repair, and spending some time in
prison, she is now awaiting execution on her own
recognisances. Presumably she will continue in
that state for the rest of her life, and the law
probably calculates that the knowledge that she
is waiting to be hanged on her own recognisances
will make her walk a chalk-line for ever after-
wards.

An Italian organ-grinder in Sydney has got
four months’ gaol for habitually biting his small
brother when the latter did not collect enough
money. A medical examination of the small
brother revealed the fact that he had been bitten
all over, and the practice had evidently been or
long standing, as many of the scars appeared to
be the remains of very old bites. It is alleged
that music is a soothing influence, but either there
are exceptions to this rule, or else the hand-organ
isn’t music, or else the Italian was really soothed,
and it was the music that prevented him biting
his little brother a lot more than he did.

ODE TO A N'ERALD BOY.
Shine out, O smudgy kid !
Let not your light be hid :
’Twas meant to gladden
The eyes of men who need
A hevenin’ rag to read—
Including Madden.
When customers draw nigh,
How dulcet is your cry,
How proud your bearing.
One never sees you fight
With rival boys at night,
Or hears you swearing.
You never force the sale
Of “ pypers ” with a tale
A t all untruthful :
You ne’er, in dullest times,
Imagine gory crimes
With fancy youthful.
Your language, soft and sweet,
Makes music down the street;
’Tis strictly proper.
We don’t believe as how
You’d stoop to stone a Chow,
Or “cheek” a “copper.”
Shine out, dear urchin small,
Example bright for all
The base and bad ’uns !
Diffuse your virtue rare;
This is our heartfelt prayer—
And also Madden’s.

One proviso in tlie S. A. State Bank Bill is to
the effect that the Slate Bank shall be the only note-
issuing institution in South Australia, and that its issue
is limited to £600,000. except in times of special stress,
when It may be increased by proclamation to £750,000.
The notes are to he redeemable in gold on demand at the
head office of the bank. Under these circumstances the
restriction to £600,000 seems utterly stupid and unneces-
sary. So long as nobs are redeemable on demand the
public will only take as many of them as it wants for
trade purposes, and it should get as many as it wants,
whatever that number may b°. It is impossible to unduly
inflate the currency while the StSte Bank pays gold for
all notes presented to it ; under these conditions-the cur-
rency regulates itself. The proposed limit is about £1
18s. of paper money per inhabitant, and in France the
circulation is more than twice that amount, while in the
U.S. it equals £3 per head. The S.A. State B ink is to
hold a gold reserve equal to one-fifth its circulation, the
other four-fifths being invested In Government bonds and
other securities. Under these conditions the institution
will be equally secure whether its note-issue is £lOO,OOO
or ten millions, and the amount should be unlimited,
its regulation being left to popular demand.

The N S.W. Bank Notes Act of ’93 is on tlie
point of expiring, and as nothing lias b a en done to
replace it by a permanent m -asure, the old state,of chaos
will presently supervene. The worst features of all are
that, on its expiration, not-s will cease to he a first charge
upon assets, and anv wildcat institution in N.S.W.
which chooses to call itself a bank, may issue notes at its
own sweet will. Recently, a good business lias been done
in other provinces with the rag monej’ of tlie Provincial
and Suburban and other long-d f 11 net institutions, and
even the pap-f of the ancient and forgotten Bank of
Queensland has been found in circulation. The average
man way back doesn’t know one bank from another, and
is prepared, except in times of panic, to take anything in
the shape of a bank-note which anyone may offer him,
and when he can he fooled w ith the paper of an institu-
tion which died 20 or 30 years ago, he is capable of taking
the alleged securities of an)’ “bank” living or dead.
Tlie pr -sent’A ‘t lias done a great deal to prevent the
issue of shoddy currency in N.S.W., and its expiration
Anil be a public calamity.

Th ' N.S.W. L°g. Council lias hurried through
a Bill to permanently establish the reconstruction prin-
ciple whereby the busted company rises from the
financial dead, and postpones its liabilities for ten years
or so, and goes on ag tin as if nothing had gone wrong.
What will happen to it in the Assembly is still doubtful,
but the Labor members, at all events, will probably give
a solid vote against it. Still, there are many good points
about the reconstruction idea, if it is based on equitable
principles ; the mischief so far is that it hasn’t been based
on anything resembling equity. The first essential pro-
viso is that, before a co. gets permission to reconstruct,
there should lie a searching investigation into its affairs
- hy State-appointed officials, and if the State auditors re-
port that, it is capable of fulfilling the proposed arrange-
ment, whatever that may be, and that arrangement is
assented to by a majority of the creditors, then it should
lie allowed to reconstruct as much as it wants to. Tlie
second prm iso is that the creditors should thereafter be
represe Red 01 the Board until their claims are paid in
fill . Uud r these conditions even the much-abused re-
constnicti- n device is vas'ly preferable to promiscuous
liquidation. Liquid ition is a process by which tlie assets
disappear faster than a snowball in hell, and no one
knows where they go to, save that the lawyers get a lot
of them, for app aring in court and asking permission, at
a cost of .t’2.) or so in f -es, to accept 30s. from shareholder
Smith in It u of the £7 10s. he owes, on the ground that
theoiher £6 as irrecoverable. Also, though much lias
b en said about the slow agony of reconstruction, the
agmvof liquidation is generally a lot slower. Nothing
o 1 llrs ea-rtn is slower than a big, fat, pompous liquida-
te ■.

The City of Melbourne Building Society
is still liquidating. It has properties of the nominal
value of £276,000, and other investments, and at present
the total income from all these is about £4OOO annually.
Repairs, taxes, costs of liquidation, &c., come to about
£9OOO a year. Cons quently it seems that it costs £5OOO

S im» years ago, it appears, a Sydney firm sold
to the National L ind and Building Co. a piece of land, at
Leichhardt, for £lo,ooo—£3ooo cash and £7OOO on mort-
gage. The co. cut it up and sold it to thrifty, horny
handed toilers, and about 30 of them spent their scanty
savings in purchasing allotments on the instalment plan,
and erecting houses thereon. The co. took their money
cheerfully mid promised them their title-deeds when they
paid up. But, as it didn’t apply the cash thus received
in payment of the m irtgag*, which is mw overdiy, the
origin d s II r pnposes to forccl ise in order to recover his
£70)0. T 10 30 tenants have no legal standing in Urn
matter. T ueir bits of land —fur which some of
them pail as mu ah as £4OO in cash—in the
homes they have built on them, are all legally
f wfeited, and they have no apparent remedy anv-
wher-. T i<>r • is mlhuig illegal, it, seems, in the action
of the land co. It sold something which it couldn’t

Tlie Royal Bink of Australia has closed the
ha'f year with a net profit Of £2039-a slight falling off
from the £2130 earned last, half-year and the £2874 fur
the ha'f year end ,-d 30th S 'pt.,’94. Compared with the
figures of a year ago th ■ note circulation has decli led
goni ’what; th 1 itnn, “ bills in circulation,” has dropped
nearly one-half; a id the d posi s hive dim’nished fnm
£255,000 to *.216,000. A mong the assets, advinccs have
dec i icd by £13,000, hut though the total liabilities have
been red tic d by £3B,O'K) the cadi res'rve has i icreased.
Th ■ I! >yal has now £439,826 in cash against liabilities to
the p iblic of onli £2:3,000, equal to not less than 37 per
cent. There is’ag.abi no div. and the balance to credit of
profit and |c#>fdj-incli now ammnts to £17,378, is carried
forward. T ie U iyal frankly admits tint it will be necessary
to write off n portion of its capital as lost when the long-
promised Companies Act is passed so as to allow of such
an operation ; for the Vic. law, astonishing ns it may seem,
doesn’t at present permit the writing-off of lost capital.
But though the directors have, in their last three reports,
mentioned that it will he necessiry to write off capital,
they' have not once explained the amount of the bank’s
losses, though the fact that the net profits only equal
about £1 Bs. per cent, per annum on the nominal paid-
up capital is, evidence that a very considerable propor-
tion of the funds is yielding no return, or a merely
nominal one, at present. The balance-sheet lumps
■together bills receivable in Victoria, landed property,
Govt, stocks, loans on mortgage, and all manner of
securities in one big item, after the usual obscure bank-
ing fashion. The best featu-csof the document are the
reduction in expenses, the big cash reserve, and the f ict
that the bank fittings, furniture, stationery, &c. f are put
down at the very moderate figure of £3BO. As the Royal
lias certain losses to meet it might as well begin to pro-
vide for them by writing off the £17,378 at credit of profit
and loss, which, under existing conditions, is a mere
ornament. Also, it might inform its shareholders how
they really stand.
• • * »
If tire Victorian Companies Bill passes in its
present shape it will make a revoluti in in the local bank
balance-sheet. According to its provisions that hitherto
murky document fnust show separately among the assets
how much is held in Govt, and municipal securities, with
particulars of the securities, iiow much in lulls and pro.
notes, in cash on hand or in banks, in real estate, loans
on mortgage, loans on other securities (nature of securi-
ties to be specified), loans without securities, and shares
of other companies (the names of the companies to be
specified). The securities in which the reserve fund is
invested must he s-t forth. Also, among the liabilities
must he fully explained the amount due on deposits bear-
ing interest, deposits not bearing interest, mortgages,
bank overdrafts, judgments, bills and pro. notes,
and contracts. Some balance - sheets, under these
new conditions, will be very interesting reading.
Still one or two important factors are omitted.
Tlie balance-sheet ought also to state whether the
assets are taken at their original cost, or, if they are
taken at a valuation, when that valuation was made.
When the usual statem-mt is advanced that allowances
have been made for had and doubtful debts, it should
also be clearly set forth bow much allowance has been
made. Under present conditions the allowance may be
lid. Farther, while the bill makes directors criminally
responsible for false statements, it should extend an equal
responsibility to managers and auditors. And, above all,
it Should provide for a State audit. The auditors, at pre-
sent, are appointed by the shareholders. The directors,
by virtue of their own shares and their proxies, can
generally command the biggest vote at the shareholders’
meeting, so they very often appoint the auditors. And
naturally, if things are crooked, they appoint men who
won’t expose them, or ask awkward questions, or look into
tilings that are not meant to be looked-into.
When the Vic. Parliament is on the job of com-
pany-reform, it should also provide firs State audit of
life-assurance sooieti s, and should enact that their
balance-sheets shall show the following things; (1) The
ameunt received as rent, interest on mortgages, and in-
terest on other investments, separately; (2) the amount
under each heading that is accrued but not due, and the
amount in arrear. And it should bo made a felony of the
deepest dye to disguise interest arrears by lumping them
in with th“ capital of the mortgages, by which device in-
terest maybe charged oo hopelessly-dead securities for
years and years, and taken credit for as profits, and dis-
tributed among policy-holders, without anything appearing
in the balance-sheet to suggest that both’the interest and
the principal are dead and gone and utterly lost. Some
societies don’t even profess to show arrears. Others do,
but there is no possible guarantee that they show all the
arrears, and The Bulletin strongly suspects that in some
cases th°y only show a small amount as a guarmtee of
good f lith, and lump the rest with the mortgages. Tiiis
is the weak spot in insurance business. The only way the
public can f irm anything like a reliable estimate of the
safety of the investments is by noting the amount of
interest which is actually collected each year, and the
amount which is due hut doesn’t come in. And the
societies don’t show this in any trustworthy shape.
Sometimes the public has the management’s own per-
sonal assurance on the subject, which doesn't necessarily
amount to much, and somniruos it hasn’t even that,
which amounts to a good deal less.

J.T. (Kurnalpi) : Groat ignorance prevails as
fo what a Mint or can do, for the miner. You can
yourself smd parcels of gold registered post to Melb.
Mint for purchase at Mint value. The bank now sends
your po'd there, and you could save the middleman
profits by doing the business yourself. The cost of pos-
tage would be about 4Jd. per oz. —21 oz. make an
economical small parcel to send. Toe Mint will remD. the
money to you in whatever way you wish, or your friends
can collect fir you. If you suspect the price your gold-
buyer gives you, there would be no harm in sending two
or three ounces to Melb. (or Sydney) Mint, fir purchase ;
you will then get a document showing the actual assay
and value of your gold. Now that the W.A. Govt, has
decided on a local Mint it shoul I be pushed ahead for the
sake of the industry. Bankers and storekeepers are
get ing more than their fair profits on gold-buying.
D.L C. : It’s easy just now to tip stock that will
rise. Bistdes, one success will alone in public estimation
for three failures. Everything has been rising. The
really useful mining tipster is the fellow who can tell you
when the rise is going to stop and the boom to burst.

understand mining, re the muddle that the ’9l Act
brought in. It is a positive trap to gull the public and
satisfy the land-holders. On one district field
the royalty demanded, and paid, is 25 per cent,
gross gold ! Of course, only the plum claims can pay it;
but there are many lOdwt. to 15dwt. and up to loz. reefs
that would be worked as ordinary block oliims. I believe
1 am right in stating that not one lease has been granted
on application (except under the private-agreement
clause) under the new Act, This, of course, is simply
holding back the land until the eyes are picked out. The
miners here openly confess that their only chance of
getting anything through quickly is per the member for
the Bogan Bridge at Monkey. I believe that for the same
reason .leases under the old Act have been delayed and
shunted so that the applicants may conceal the auriferous
deponts and hold them in reserve. I have reported part
of what I have seen to the Minister for Mines, and have
pointed out to Mr. Siee the glaring absurdity of the
alleged mining here. It is notable that there are no
visible union men here. The aid from the p ospecting
vote has been granted per backstairs. One of the great
multi non-working claim-holders has just told me that
his name was put down as requiring Government aid by
a certain M.P., and that without his sanction. If that is
not roads-bridges-cum-vote-flshing, then I have no
morals.—Phil Mocbrat.

Certain big Melb. drapers have been getting
their trade-circulars printed in England and thence
posted in open envelopes to their clients in Victoria—thus
depriving the Vic. P.O. of revenue and the local printers
of work. The authorities have now got level with this
system by collecting duty on the circulars as “imported
printing.”

Some more about the Ernest Giles Prospecting
Co. 600 shares are to be issued to test and develops the
finds made by the prospector; and it is proposed to
authorise the directors to dispose of any claims dis-
covered. This latter is extremely desirable, The Bul-
letin belief being that of the two mining asses—the man
who buys a mine and the man who won’t sell one—the
latter is the worse.

The Young O’Brien mine, Grenfell, N.S.W.,
has been placed under offer, and is going to London.
Mr. Woodhouse, one of the many smilers on Ciolgardie,
lias lately reported. The mins is a fair one: reef from
2 to 4ft., run of gold nearly 203 ft. long, but largely con-
fined to a mineralised streak in the reef, which has’so far
averaged about an ounce to the ton. The Young O’Brien
should pay on a small capital, but is not good enough to
stand a big one.

The Garibaldi mine (Hillgrove, N.S.W.) floated
in London. Capital, £50,000 ; working capital, £20,000.
It can’t have too much working capital. A very low-

money as the mine seems to be worth.

The Charters Towers gold-yields for Sept., says
Bright’s Circular, were satisfactory, being just short of
21,0000zs. —the average of the field for many months.
Until the Brilliant Block 40 head gets to work the yield is
likely to remain at about 21,0000 z-i. monthly. The re-
turns for the nine months were 191,-919 tons for 189,8770zi.
—an increase over the corresponding period of last year
of 15,724 tons and 22270z5. Calls for Sept., £6492, diva.,
£20,173, and for the nine months—calls, £64,886; dlv*.,
£181,624 ; excess of profits, £117,328. Share market
quiet. Westralia has distracted attention, and local
ardor has been damped by the Papuan not getting the
Victoria reef. In the Brilliant and St. George there are
good faces of stone everywhere. Month’s yield, 1474 tons
for 28120z5. ; div., 9d. (£5400). Brilliant (three clean-ups

Lefroy (Tas.) feels more hopeful about its future
extension beyond the Pinafore and Volunteer lines pow
that the Recruit has struck a payable-looking reef 120 ft.
down. This development happens in comparatively new
country some distance north of the Chum’s mine. ’■
Prospects of the Volunteer line improving.
Volunteer continues to raise good stone. West Volunteer
has a new make of good gold-hearing quartz, and the last
90 tons crushing gave 200 oz. amalgam, while East
Volunteer has cut into a well mineralised lode— no gold
showing, although it is expected to be found in proving
th'e hanging-wall.

Mailed from London to The Bulletin :
“ Things Coolgardian are going well here. The general
idea is that there are some big mines at Hannan’s, but no
doubt the majority of them are the worst sort of fakes.
Market getting pretty well loaded, and appears to be a
bit top-heavy now. Some of the w'eaker ones are being
shaken out this settlement. What the end will be it is
hard to tell, but this boom can’t last for ever. There will,
however, be a good mining market for some timeforgood

It was considered in London that Bravo Jones
was asking too much for the Tasmanian. If he had asked

Latest Great -Boulder crushing 357 tons,
17530 z., and mine reported as looking well all round. In
and around the Boulder dislriot the Coolgardie boomers
have at last found a resting-place. At one and for a long
lime it was Bayley’s ;'for a little while it was the Plun-
derderry, then the Wealth Of Expectations. Now one is
inclined to ask if any of these mines ever really existed.
Anyhow, the Boulder has evidently come to stay, and it
should be called the Coolgardie Redeemer. A map of
Hannan’s is an appalling sight. Leases (Boulders of
every sort) are pegged for six to eight miles long and
three miles wide. N£>b° d J' now asks what has become of
the many hundreds of Je ises around Bayley’s, the Plun-

Bayley’s South half-yearly meeting — very dole-
ful report. Sylvester Bro vne, Keating and Grice, direc-
tors, resigned. Stone crushed, 2125 tons for 16240 z.
“ Whenever the yield of stone has been insufficient to
keep the battery in full work five head of stamps have
been usefully employed by crushing for the public.” And
it has only 10 heads. The reef is big enough to keep 30
going, but the cold truth is that it will not pay to lake
out and crush as it comes away. “ The co. still' holds the
14,000 reserved shares, and economy is exercised where
possible, and the directors have drawn no fees since
April 1.”

One or two of the Coolgardie mines are still

The prospectus of the South Mount Lyell Ex-
tended Mining Co; (Tasmania) appears in the advertising
columns of this issue. The lode in this mine, it appears, con-
sists of a large pyrites formation, averaging from 2ft. to
12ft. wide. Bulk assays return loz. 12dwts. gold, 12oz.
silver, and 17 per cent, copper. Two trenches have been
cut, one 15ft. long by 4ft. wide, and one 12ft. by 3ft., and so
far as the investigations have gone the lode is solid and
with every prospect of permanence. Only 1200 shares were
offered to the public, and they have already been rushed,
therefore the prospectus is chiefly offered for public
information.

Visitors to the Spouting Spring at Heli-
don, 70 miles from Brisbane, are always astounded
at the quantity of water they can consume at tke
Spring. Ten or 12 tumblers in an hour or so are
taken with comfort. The reason is that the
tissues of the body are absorbing the water all the
time. Something beneficial is always added bo
the system by every glass of Helidon Spa water
consumed. Messrs. Tooth and Co., Kent

Dangers of Travel.
The dangers incidental to travelling seem to he
increasing rather than diminishing. Almost daily
it is our painful duty to record appalling deaths,
on land and sea, and it would almost seem as il
the progress we are supposed to have made in
scientific appliances, in place of minimising, en-
hances the chances of danger. But on more care-
ful consideration we find it is not so much that
science is at fault as that men are careless.
Carelessness is the actual cause of a great per-
centage of the most terrible catastrophes and
deaths, and as responsible persons ignore
this fact the present death-rate will continue. To
permit the kidneys to rot away, or to suffer lime-
stone deposits to accumulate in the bladder, is
criminal carelessness, especially when a sure and
safe cure is obtainable. Mr. Thomas J. R.
Bakhap, Mine Proprietor, Hobart, Tasmania,
says : “lam pleased to say that some years ago
I derived great and lasting benefit from the use of
Warner’s Safe Cure. At that time I suffered
from a distressing kidney disease, and although I
tried many medicines I derived very little benefit
from them. I was then advised to try Warner’s
Safe Cure, and took three or four bottles, at the
same time strictly conforming to the dietary rules
prescribed". I am pleased to say that the Safe
Cure completely cured me, and I have not suffered
in the least from the complaint from that day to
this, and consider ray cure permanent. The
other day Lrecommended a frffend to try Warner’s
Safe Cure for a complaint similar to my own, and
he already «xperiences much relief, and is con-
fident that the medicine will effect a complete
cure in his case.”

Dear Bulletin, —An
example of how Freetrade
works out in England. I
met a Chicago wool-buyer
on a Cunard steamer who
had bought, on behalf of
several American firms,
upwards of £200,000 worth
of Australian greasy wool
at London sales. This
wool was to be taken to

a mixture of cotton, sent
back in the form of piece

up into clothing by sweat-

A Maoriland narra-

after being snowed up for

subjected to “ the icy
blasts that have been pre-
valent.” The narrator is
Geo. Sutherland, a name
redolent of unromantic
Scotch veracity. He tells
further of sheep that
“generally have about
4in. of ice on their backs
of “ wild sheep (carrying
about three years’ wool) ”
that “ have a coating of
about 6in. of ice, and look
a good deal like armadillos

down £.of sheep “ invari-

“ The Big Irishman ” writes The Bulle-
tin :
As regards the late Salmon Wilson’s son-in-law, the
Huntingdon title is safe enough, but the claim to the Irish
estates is undoubtedly weak. In his famous essay on
Warren Hastings, after whom, by the way, Huntingdon 8
brother is named. Lord Macaulay says: “His family re-
ceived from the Tudors the earldom of Huntingdon ;
which, after a long dispossession, was regained in our own
day by a series of events. scarcely paralleled in romance.’*
This referred to the present earl’s great grand-
father, who was a sailor before the mast, when
a good-natured lawyer took up his case. I have
always heard that had the lawyer in question
not died suddenly and left his affairs in confusion,
the Huntingdon family, in addition to the title, would
have gained the estates afterwards squandered by that
Juggins of the last generation—the Marquis of Hastings.
The present earl’s grandfather married an Irish heiress
named Power. He had not a cent, and her property was
ruined in paying his pre-marital debts, and in keeping
his still poorer relations. Those who think that Ireland
must thrive under the management of Englishmen,
should witness what havoc English management wrought
on one of the most prosperous corners of the island.
When that Irish heiress’s sob, the present earl’s father,
attained his majority, she being dead, her cousin, the
eldest male representative of the Power family, laid claim
to the estates, and went so far as to serve the tenants
with ejectment notices. But the action was suddenly
dropped, and it is supposed that Power, who passed his
days in London, was “squared.” Anyhow, the law of
primogeniture was on his side, and I have heard an old
Irish lawyer declare that Power’s eldest son could still
lay claim to his estates. Perhaps this is what troubled Sir
Salmon.

WOOL RESERVES.
In accordance with their usual custom in directing
attention to all matters affecting the Wool Trade,
the National Wool Company of Melbourne, re-
mark upon the practice some woolgrowers have of
placing too high reserves upon their produce.
They point out that the woolbrokers in the
best position to* gage the current market values,
and it is best to at the first time of offering,
for in most cases a re-offered wool is neglected;
in fact, there is a clear understanding between the
wool-buyers that all withdrawn parcels are at the
option of the last bidder. It is only when the
market is very active and rising that owners have
a chance of securing better prices, while, if the
market is at all weak, the original bid is rarely
maintained. It should also be borne in mind that
wools show to the best advantage when first
opened out, but after the first handling by the
buyers it, to a great extent, loses its attractive
appearance.*

POLITICAL POINTS
A minimum wage of 7s, 6d. a day is to be
enforced in all Vic. collieries holding State
contracts.
Lord Brassey (at a banquet) on the Imp.
Federation League :
With regard to the league, there had oome a time when
it seemed that there was nothing more to be done, no
special effort to be made, and he had come to the con-
clusion that the Imperial Federation League should exist
no longer.
There was nothing done, and nothing more-to be
done. That is just about the size of Imperial
Federation.
Chief Justice Way is credited with writ-
ing some of the speeches which his brother-in-
law, Dr. Campbell, fires off in S.A. Leg. Council.
The sting of present Q. Parliament will be
in its tail. The big railway bribe will keep the
rest of the session busy, and possibly cleave
asunder Nelson’s compact crew.
Q. Attorney-General Byrnes, Griffith’s
white-headed “boy,” is to be opposed by the
same man whom Byrnes beat so decisively at last
election with the usual dummy independent
candidate to split the white votes. Byrnes’
tongue will most likely procure him a second
innings.
The turf is the fetish of one prominent
Labor politician—his vote can never be reckoned
on when there is a horse-race within the metro-
politan radius. The fact that a suburban race-
meeting bulked larger in his eyes than the
interests of his special constituents had serious
results the other day.
The appointment of Julius Vogel to be
financial adviser in London to the M.L. Govt, is
a foolish piece of jobbery. The billet, which
Vogel’s predecessor, Penrose Julyan, filled with
no great credit, at a screw of .£4OO a year, should
be abolished. Maoriland is now “advised” in
London by Agent-General Perceval, by the Bank
of England, the 8.N.Z., and by Vogel, and yet
Treas. Ward went ’Ome to look after the last
loan in person, and Seddon cabled more advice
after him.
Nothing shows the incurable Toryism of
the Nelson Ministry so strongly as its new
railway schemes. It has the impudence, in
the middle of 0ct.fd.895, to bring in plans for tin-
pot lines through trumpery districts, and announces
that the compensation will be very heavy. Not a
word about Betterment.
Brassey at least makes no vain clamor
about dear old Hingland’s devotion to “her
colonies,” Witness:—
He was bound also to say that if the mother country
had no other interests to consider than those of her own
island, if she had no other colonies to protect, her navy
would have to he as strong as it was to-day.
This tone will not suit the Victorian Tory party,
which has long traded upon the idea that the
beloved mother country exhausted herself to
suckle her brood.
The Vic. Govern-
ment proposes to lend
to the municipalities
.£50,000 of trust-moneys
without interest, repay-
able in 30 years, or a cen-
tury, or something like
that. The reason as-
signed is that the unex-
pected reduction of the
subsidy has run many
of them into difficulties,
money having been spent
in advance —and so on.
The Vic. Government
has lent a lot of money
to local bodies. Most
of them are in arrear
with their interest; some
have never paid any in-
terest at all; and, in
a very large proportion
of cases, the principal
seems hopeless. Some
of the most hopeless ones
of the lot are now how 1-
ing for further loans or
subsidies, and the ones
that howl loudest are in
difficulties, as a rule,
because they flatly re-
fuse to tax themselves
sufficiently to meet their
ordinary expendituie.
Turner might just as
well lend that £50,000
to the great sea-serpent.
Ex-Attorney -Gen-
era! O’Loghlen, rising
in his barristerial wrath
to denounce a Vic.
Crown prosecution of
alleged conspirators as a
scandalous instance of
“ the way in which the
strings are pulled,” is
rather an amusing sub-
ject for reflection.
O’Loghlen should be the
last man to suggest that the Crown has strings
attached to us works.
Premier Reid has, it is understood, in
view of an absolute dead-lock with the N.S.W.
Upper House on his taxation proposals, shaped
for himself a course of procedure which will give
ad interim, effect to the will of the Lower House,
leaving the battle of ascendancy to be fought out
leisurely afterwards. The he is said to
entertain has its nearest parallel in Gladstone s
management of the Army Purchase Bill.
Kingston’s drastic measure of law-reform
has paralysed S.A. sharkdom. He proposes
that no candidate for solicitorship need pass any
examination before being articled, take any degree,
or be examined in any dead language. To become
a solicitor a candidate need only pass in law of
property, contracts, wrongs, principle of common
law and equity, and law of evidence. The bill
also reduces court fees, and makes a heavy reduc-
tion in solicitors’ costs, and provides for the ad-
mission of women as attorneys. It has no chance
of passing, but it will be handy at next April
elections.
N.S.W. Parliament, if anxious to econo-
mise, should think of the numerous useless but
supposedly-ornamental personages of the Black-
rod pattern. Before women cleaners-out are
ousted or docked, some member with a hard jaw
should demand the abolition of Blackrod & Co.
And what about his eminence, the hangman ?
Will anyone contend that the Govt, man-butcher
is worth .£156 a year in these hard-up days?
Three pounds a week, wet and dry ! Why, a
hangman for all Australia shouldn’t cost that .
Let us federate in Hangmen ! Anything for a
beginning.
The shoddy question turned uj) again last
week in Yic. Assembly. The police uniforms are
made of imported English cloth, and cost about
£5 a suit. Maloney, M.L.A., solemnly tore a
sample of this cloth into rags with two fingers of
each hand, and as a cloud of dust and- fluff flew
around he asked the Government to patronise the
local article in future. Then he produced a
similar sample of the local goods, costing
about half the money, and professed to hang
on to it with all his strength, and it gave not
an inch. Still the result might have been different
if Murray Smith had hung on to that local
sample. It is quite surprising how different the
results may be when an enemy is hanging on to
the sample.
Three more Yic. Freetrade Ms.L.A.
“ chucked up ” the good eause last week. Bowser,
Craven and little Johnny Isaacs voted steadily
and consistently for reducing duties all along the
line till the tobacco item was reached, and then
they rose unanimously, like one lone gum-tree in
the middle of a great waste, and demanded Pro-
tection to the extent of nearly 300 per-cent. They
also pointed out that Protection, in this particular
case (though not in cither cases), helped the in-
dustry along, increased the supply, kept down
prices, supplied work, and did many other good
f things. They all represent tobacco-growing dis-
tricts, and every Freetrader wants Protection for
his own industry. Freetrade is always meant for
the other fellow, somehow.
Recent cables, indicating that a batch
of immigrants are on the way to New Cale-
donia, seem to prove that convict-transportation
to that quarter has actually ceased. This agrees
with the forecast of Consul Biard d’Aunet, of
Sydney, after a visit to New Caledonia a couple
of years ago. "’New Caledonia starts its free life
in these seas 56 years later than N.S. Wales, 42
years later than Tasmania, and 27 years later than
West Australia. But how will free-labor com-
pete with the assigned convict-labor on which the
John Higginsons of the place rely ? In 1879 the
Noumean Government entered into a contract
with Higginson, granting him the services of 300
convicts for 20 years at one penny per day per
man ; and several other contracts of a similar kind
are now current.

successful in evading,taxation. In the old coun-
try, the “ big ” man has not only to pay income
and land-tax when liable, but is also mulct for
inhabited-house duty and establishment licenses—
i.e., 15s. per , annum for every male servant em-

annum for armorial bearings if painted on car-
riage, 21s. only if used as a crest on notepaper.
Then there are licences to kill game. The keeper
of a large establishment, such as the Duke of
Portland, will pay from £80 to .£100 per annum.
And the death-duties are now very heavy. The
N.S.W. “big” man, much as he is inclined to
cry out, has no reason to complain.—V.
An indignant Maoriland traveller writes
to Sydney Telegraph
From a strictly British point of view, it can scarcely be
considered a free country. The pettifogging legislation
which the rulers indulge in with regard to details of minor
importance is enough to disgust any sensible man. When
I was there in February last, a friend and I called in at an
hotel one evening and asked for cigars, and were sur-
prised to be told by the landlord that he was not per-
mitted to sell cigars on Wednesday after 1 p.m. The
Early Closing Act, which has had the presumption to
seek to regulate the actions of men and women, almost
with regard to ever3 r detail of their lives from dawn till 5
p.m., has proved a most obnoxious law, and has caused
more trouble and dissatisfaction in the colony than any
similar law for many years past. Amongst other en-
croachments oif liberty, commercial offices must close at 5
p.m. ; but, if suitable representation be made to the
local government official that it is impossible to finish the
day’s invoices by 5 p.m., a “dispensation” maybe granted
to Keep the office open until 5.30 p.m. for the purpose of
invoicing only.

FIFTEENTH REPORT.
Presented to the Shareholders at the Ordinary General Meeting on 30th October, 1895.
On referring to the annexed balance-sheet and statement of accounts to 30th September last (duly
audited and certified), it will be seen that the bank’s business has been well maintained—the profit
earned being about the same as last half-year. The Companies Act Amendment Bill, alluded to in
previous reports, authorising the reduction of capital by writing off losses, is now before Parliament,
and no doubt it will shortly be dealt with ; in the meantime, the directors propose to carry forward, as
before, the balance at credit of Profit and Loss Account, amounting to <£17,378 ss. 6d., inclusive of
<£15,339 13s. l«*d. brought from last half-ysar. During the period covered by the accounts, financial
affairs have been somewhat unsettled (one local bank having gone into liquidation) and the directors
have considered it judicious to maintain very large cash reserves—the amount at the balance being
thirty-seven per cent, of the bank’s total liabilities to the public; this, of course, prejudicially
affects profits, but it will doubtless meet with the approval of shareholders as being in the best in-
i crests of the bank.
Since the last half-yearly meeting, Mr. David Death resigned his seat at the board, which it is
nst proposed to fill, as four directors are found to be sufficient for the effective control of the bank’s
business. A resolution reducing the number of di ectors to four will be proposed at the meeting.
By order of the board.

There were no moonlight rambles, garden-
gate chats, or any other sentimental nonsense
about Bullooky Tom’s courtship. While in search
one day of stray members of his team, Tom
espied Liz., the daughter of a neighboring farmer,
paddling about the brink of a pond with her boots
off. “ Good day, Liz.” “ ’Elio, Tom.” “What
yer doing there ? ” asked Tom. “Ketchin’ leeches
ter put on father’s leg,” replied the girl. “ How’d
yer like to be married ?” queried the big bullock-
puncher. “Wouldn’t mind if I got the chance,”
answered the agricultural maiden. “ How’d yer
fancy me tor a cove ?” further questioned Tom.
“You’d do,” assented the girl. “Right,” con-
cluded the wooer, “ I’ll see the old man and fix
it up.” A week later Tom and Liz. ran in double
harness.

Great Britain has compelled the Chow
Emperor, by threats of bombardment, to degrade
the Governor of Szechuan for complicity in the
recent missionary massacres, and to declare him
incapable of again holding office. It now tran-
spires that the same thing happened to the same
Governor in connection with another missionary
outbreak a year ago, and apparently he was none
the worse for it. Probably he will be none the
worse this time either.

Thousands of Unsolicited Testimonials:
“The boots fit splendidly and are very cheap. You
should extend your business to N.Z., where no such system
is in vogue. I shall do what I can to recommend you.”—
GEO. PAMMENT, Seddon-st., Kumara, N.Z. May 7,1895.
“ The boots you made me from description of my foot
and self-measurements have more than satisfied me. I
never had a pair of such well-fitting and comfortable
boots—so much so, that I have discarded all my old
enemies. Your price, including everything, ‘ does
not come up to the price charged here for boots not to
be compared with yours.”—JOHN M'ARTHUR, Police
Magistrate, Longreach, Queensland. May 31, 1895.
“ I am sending you an order for two more pairs of your
boots. Those you sent me were a splendid fit, and for
workmanship and durability they could not lie surpassed.
I have had them in wear now 12 months, and there is not
a crack in them, and I have no more trouble with my in-
growing nails or corns."—SAML. RUTTER, Moorara

There is a nice nest of squatting J’sP.
round about Muswellbrook and Scone, N.S.W.
A selector has about as much chance before them,
where squatting sympathies are concerned, as a
too-early Christian had with an arena-full of lions.
Dudley le Souef, of Melb. Zoo, loves to
tell yarns of his snakes. His Natal rock-snake
one day swallowed its blanket, and then put
away a'rabbit as dessert. For three weeks its
liver was sluggish. Then snakey got restless,
coughed up the blanket undigested, and, after
washing, both blanket and snake were as good as
new. _ A fortnight later this same serpent tried to
wrap its blanket round its inside again, but was
prevented when about half-way through. But the
big Indian python went one better, for he swal-
lowed his blanket and didn’t cough it up. The
tiger-snakes also have bad habits in this line.
Very often two of different sizes will fasten on
opposite ends of a mouse; in that case the smaller
one follows the mouse into the bigger one’s in-
terior and is never seen again. Another serpent,
Hamadryas , is a confirmed cannibal, eating nothing
but other snakes.
About three-fourths of the medicine con-
sumed by the Chinese in Australia —and they are
great drug-takers—is of European manufacture.
The more conservative Chows, however, stick
religiously to their native drugs, the manufacture
of one firm of pig-tailed apothecaries in Canton
having the greatest vogue. This business has
been in the hands of one family for over GOO years,
and is doubtless the oldest-established drug con-
cern in the world. About 40 different kinds of
medicine are manufactured, and as much as 4s. is
paid for a single pill. The trade-mark of the
firm is a severed hand, and the legend is that one
of the founders, having refused a customer
“ cledit,” had his hand chopped off by the enraged
client, whose wife had died, presumably through
the inability of the husband to procure the
precious drug. The severed hand, surmounted by
some hieroglyphics which are the Chinese equiva-
lent for ‘‘no tick,” adorns the gorgeous advt.-
cards of the establishment.

Mrs. Andrews, a charming champion
of her sex, took the stage at Melb. Athenseum
Hall, the other evening, and discoursed eloquently,
in a tasteful costume and sweet, soothing tones,
upon the matter of New Woman’s revolt against
tyrant Man. Mrs. Andrews’ lecture, which was
erudite and to the point, although it went only to
the polished side of the point, asserted woman’s
right to control the tyrant aforesaid with the
influence of her superior nature. This right, says
the pretty little enthusiast, is being more and
more conceded to the sex. “A good, womanly
love is the only power they ever had, or will ever
have, in the world. In the future, as in the past,
the real strength will be with the Womanly
Woman.” The statement is quite unoriginal, yet
it seems very fresh and fragrant these times. Also
it sounds unquestionably true from the mouth of
the lecturess. Such intellectual angels as she find
nothing in the social system to revolt against, pro-
vided that they have not been unfortunate in
their matrimonial choice- And if they do happen
to marry stingy, intractable brutes, the fault, says
this smiling matron, is their own in not having
exercised better judgment. The question as to
whether Beaut}', having committed an error of
judgment, may be entitled to bolt from the Beast,
doesn’t vex the philosophy of Mrs. T. R.
Andrews. There are men in the world whom
even she couldn’t lead with a glossy thread
plucked from her black back hair —but no matter.
Mrs. Andrews is exceedingly nice and improving,
as a woman and a lecturesss, and The Bulletin
looks forward with soulful eyes to the time when
every daughter of Eve will bring her sort of in-
fluence to bear upon sjciety. Meanwhile, poverty
is rife, and millions of women get their superior
qualities spoiled by sleeping in damp cellars and
sitting on doorsteps to dry themselves.
AN IMPENDING CRISIS.
Messrs. Frossard and Co. hear from reliable
authority that the demand for their Cavour Cigars
has of late increased so much that, the capacity of
the factory in Switzerland has been taxed beyond
its limits, and the sad fact stares in the face of
lovers of Cavour Cigars that for a short time at
least the market supply will not cope with the
full demand. The factory is taking active steps
to make the output equal to the heavy require-
ments addressed to it from all parts of the world.
It seems that it is the mildness and refreshing
aroma of these Cavours which rendered them so
quickly popular. Besides, the medical profession
is recommending them in all cases where the
nerves or the heart are inclined to be affected by
a stronger smoke. Another factor in favor of
this weed is its low price, which is a result of the
cheap shape adopted. Though the cigar is all
made by hand, the Swiss workmen roll these
cigars very quickly, as it enters into their
speciality, and the manufacturers have been
enabled to put all the value in the leaf employed,
instead of wasting the cost of production by pre-
senting to the public a cigar with a gracefully-
finished point that takes a lot of time and money
to make, but is obtained at the expense of the
quality of the leaf worked up.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
To-day (Thursday) the St. Alban’s Distribution
list closes, and the new owners of Trenton, Wallace,
Havoc, &c., will be discovered forthwith. Tim Bulletin
humbly prays that none of W. R. Wilson’s horses in train-
ing or promising yearlings may fall into the jewelled
hands of Ikey Mo. As for the St. Alban’s property,
ironical fate, prompted by Satan, is almost certain to
bestow it upon some honest radical, whose distress at
finding himself a bloated landowner will turn Iris brain,
in which case the “lucky” victim may perhaps swallow
the winning ticket and seek a watery grave. The St.
Alban’s Distribution is full of tragic and comic possi-
bilities.
The moral of this year’s Caulfie'd Cup is the
same as usual. Backing favorites for a mile-and-a-half
race round a course which offers many opportunities for
good or bad luck to operate, when 30 or 40 horses are
running to win (instead of being mostly engaged in stop-
ping behind one another), is a foolish practice, inasmuch
as there are many outsiders to choose from, and it is hard
to find a reason for fancying one of them more than a
dozen others. Where were Waterfalls pretensions to
special favor among, say, twenty-six Caulfield Cup
chances leaving eight starters, such as Miraculeux,
Brilliant, &0., out of consideration ? The colt’s
recent running was negative evidence against his ability
to win (with 7st. 31b. up) a race in which three-year-olds
h id become notorious for knocking under to older horses.
On form, as well as personal appearance, Ayrshire (7st.
41b.) was a better colt than Waterfall, yet he oouldn t stay
to fight out the Caulfield Stakes with Atlas, llova and
Havoc. Ayrshire fell in the Cup race. He had had luck.
Waterfall was one of the few that had good luck in get-
ting an opening to emerge from the mob. A lot of them
ran hopelessly bunched together all the way round. All
the same, Waterfall proved films If a smart animal by
fairly and squarely defeating Hopscotch, Trenchant,
Preston, Atlas, Chesterman, Havoc, and two or three
others that figured clear of the ruck half-a-mile from
home. He may be equal to winning the V.R.C. Derby.
But it must be remembered that Te Whiti, who made a
brave show' against Waterfall last Saturday, bad pre-
viously been “smothered ” by Wallace in the Guineas.
» • » *
All the “Gaiety ” cn., from speculative Deoima
Moore downwards, backed Waterfall at the instigation of
Norman Menzies. It was their “likely outsider” and
eleventh-hour tip.
* * • ♦
On the Caulfield Cup running, Trenchant,
Quiver, Monastery, and Chesterman have chances for the
Melbourne Cup, hut it is more than possible that some of
Saturday's “ ruck ” horses will beat this quartette over
tlie longer and better course.
The awful state of turf morality at Melbourne
suburban meetings, including Caulfield, is shown by
newspaper selections for petty handicaps. Horses are
tipped with the most cynical indifference to their recent
“ form,” which probably wouldn’t justify a prophet in
tipping them to win a donkey-race. The 11 great ’ jour-
nals encourage crock running with these calm sugges-
tions that certain animals couldn’t have been “on the
job" last lime they started.
• • * *
Victorian handicap horses were put bo com-
pletely in tiie shade at Caulfield that they seem bound 10
get all the best of it at Flemington. Otherwise hackers
will not be astonished, and a meeting deficient in astonish-
ment for backers is almost out of the question.
» • » ♦
The folly of discussing every horse’s chance in
a big handicap is very apparent in sporting sermons re
the Caulfield Cup. For instance, the Australasian man
said; “Mr. Oxenhfin's horses—Solatium and Waterfall-
have incurred penalties, but I should not fancy them if
they hadn’t." The more nags a prophet disposes of in
this way the greater Ids risk of being proved a blind seer.
* ♦ * *
The scratching of Hova for the Caulfield Cup
was a more outrageous business, if possible, than the
Ruenalf affair of last year. The cases stand on all fours.
Ruenalf was Kept in the race until the drawing of Taft’s
sweep, and when the ticketholder would not come to
“terms,” Ruenalf was scratched. Mr. Abey Davies and
his colleagues did likewise, with a like result, according
to the story told by the newspapers, and told, moreover,
as though this claim to fatten on a ticket-holder’s good
fortune were peifectly decent and just. The assumption
that Messrs. Davies & Co. did intend to run Hova if they
could get hold of the “sweep money” they wanted—
i.e., stand to win their stipulated portion was
no excuse for scratching him on the day of the
race, although it defends them from the charge
of deliberately dropping the public into the soup.
Mr. Davies himself declares that lie made up his mind to
scratch several days before he did it. For weeks past
Hova was said to be “ not. going ” tor Caulfield, but going
for Melbourne Cup, in which race he will probably prove
his owners to have been chasing a shadow. Men who
scratch first-class horses for valuable events when they
are in great fettle are generally not as “clever ’’ as they
think themselves. Even if Hova’s people mean
real business for the two-mile handicap, as is no
doubt the case, their brilliant champion, who has
invariably run like a non-stayer, isn’t worth backing
at a rattier short price, or a ralher long pi ice for
t 1 >.at matter. Besides, they have 1 id themselves open to
the suspicion of more scratching tactics to come.
Punters had heller leave Hova alone for the Cup, and
content themselves with the gladsome recollection that
Atlas jostled him out of the Caulfield Slakes when the
stable money was on.
•' • • •
M>lb. Argus was very soft and gentle in its
references to the Hova scratching : “ After all the public
is the main support of the turf—without its aid racing
would be impossible—and therefore it is entitled to a little
consideration from horse-owners." “Eren from high-
class Bass'ii-ty personages”—the Tory organ might have
added. Though Mr. Grice admits to having a financial
interest in Hova, but says he has nothing whatever to do
with its management.
» • • •
Mr. Abe Davies has unwisely furnished a
reason for scratching Hova. It was due to the faoi that
he (Abe) regards his luck as “ phenomenally had at Caul-
field ” —simply this, and nothing more. He had intended
to scratch Hova when final acceptances were due, but
decided at the last moment to let him remain in"
although surely there was no chance for bis ‘•pheno-
menal ” Caulfield luck to change between the Monday
and Saturday mornings. The notion of Abe hugging his
superstition, and more or less meditating whether he
should scratch Hova, whilst all the time the public con-
fidingly dropp d their money into Ikey Mo’s bag, is a
pleasant tiling to dwell upon. It ought now to be abun-
dantly plain in Australia tHat the punter who gambles
over other men’s horses does so purely at his own risk.
♦ * ♦ ♦
The 1000-guinea Coil (Abercorn-Copra) made his
debut in the Nursery Handicap, and, after being greatly
disappointed in the race, managed to secure a good second
carrying the respectable impost of Bst. 71b. The high-
priced brother to Cobbity should go one bitter in Mari-
hyrnong Plate as his most dangerous opponent, The
Officer, has to carry a 101 b. penalty for his Debutant
Stakes victory.
• • • *
The Admiral, though heavily backed by his
clever connections, failed to show' prominently in Caul-
field Cup--perhaps because the sharp turns are unsuited
to a horse of his calibre. Tbe old horse is said never to
have been in better condition than now.
♦ • ♦ •
Gaillardia quite spoilt her chance for Toorak
Handicap by bolting in her preliminary canter and pump-
ing out both herself and jockey. All going well to-day,
she should run forward in Moonee Valley Cup.
* * * •
From all accounts Wallace has a great chance of
repeating the Grand Flaneur and Martini-Henry Coup of
winning the Derby and Cup double.
• * ♦ »
At Flemington Delaware is doing well, and his
party are full of hope. Allas, The Trier, Trenchant, and
Torreador are also reckoned on not to disgrace the elder
province in Melb. Cup.
• * ♦ •
Mr, Anderson, of the V.A.T.C., holds tight to
his determination not to “pull” J. C. Bowden for libel.
“A court of honor” is the tribunal that Mr. A. believes
in, his notion of a satisfactory court being the precious
V.A.T.C. committee—composed, by the way, of his
friends and colleagues. All the while Bowden is assert-
ing that lie can back up his charge with evidence. Ander-
son’s objection to go to law looks somewhat thin. He has
merely to take proceedings, swear a denial of the asper-
sions on His honor, leave his counsel to expose the alleged
falsity of Bowden and co.’s statements, and enjoy sub-
stantial damages. The other man stands to be shot at,
but his adversary refuses to fire. Evidently a Christian
sport.
♦ » * •
“J. B. Clark’s” allegation against Arthur
Anderson, ex-chairman of the V.A.T.C., comes rather too
long after the event. Four years ago, says J.8.C., he was
shocked to find Anderson adjudicating upon a protest at
Moonee Valley when he (the aforesaid A.) had a £5O bet at
stake. What does the racing world care about such
ancient history, true or otherwise, coming from one who,
on his own showing, didn’t object to nursing the scandal
under his singlet ? Let us come to the Tim Swiveller case,
which is only two years old, or the Atlas-Hot a decision of
only a fortnight or so since. Can anyone explain why the
Caulfield stewards spent hours in arriving at decisions
upon each of those simple points, instead of getting there

Racing stewards, by the way, are always more
likely than not to be interested parties when they
deal with a protest. If they were not “sports” they
couldn’t be stewards, and, being sports, they are
betting men, with perhaps their own “little bits,” or
those of particular friends (or enemies) depending upon
the verdict of the court. A hand of keen-sighted racing
experts, who never had a shilling on a horse themselves,
and knew nothing of other people’s transactions; who
stood quite apart from stable interests, and cared for
nobody, would be the safest stewards imaginable—but
yer cai ii’t get ’em. The best stewards available are ex-
perts of good means and sense of honor, who gamble very
lightly, and possess enough moral courage to do the
right thing every time, even though their sympathies
might sometimes tempt them to do the wrong thing
when there was no fear of provoking an outcry.
Expert control of racing, cricket, football, or
any oilier sport that lives upon public patronage, is the
only possible system of government under which the
sport can flourish. The one thing necessary is tosebct
the best experts, and the selection lies with club mem-
bers. They exercise their franchise with quite as much
wisdom as the general public show in the making of a
Parliament.

The V.R.C. office went into mourning last week
for Walter Miles, son of the chief clerk, who bad had
“the boy” working beside him for nigh upon twenty
years. Miles, junr., a good fellow and apparently as
strong as the boss, was yet another victim to innUenza-
CMm-pneumonia.

From the sight-seer’s point of view a day s
racing at Caulfield is an absurdly expensive entertain-
ment compared with the show offered at Plemington for
the same money. Whilst the V.R.C. price for a grand-
stand ticket is 10s., the V.A.T.C. management, which
doesn’t provide good sealing accommodation for more
than two or three thousand people, may be said to charge
60 per cent, too much for a Caulfield Cup spectacle.
Also, the bird-cage tickets at 2s. 6d. are worse value
than the Fleminglon ditto at 6s. It was a paltry slip of
a bird-cage to begin with, and the people who pay their
half-crow ns for admission find a slice of the space railed
for “jockeys, trainers, and owners”—which really means
that they (the half-crowners) are expected to stop outside
the rails whilst the committee and its gilt-edged friends
go inside to see the horses saddled up.

St. Alban’s sweepists seem to be suffering from
Wallace on the brain. A resident of Gunnedah (N.S. W.)
wrote to a Melh. journal:—“ I dreamt that a ticket 1 had
taken in the St. Alhan’s art-uniun had drawn the race-
horse Wallace. I was present at Fleminglon and saw
Wallace win the Derby and Cup. It seemed quite clear
to me that my ticket was the winning number. The
number is 66,465.” This evidently sanguine dreamer is
put into the shade by a cocksure labouring man, who
wrote to Archie Yuille, of Melbourne, from Port Darwin.
The son of toil said :—“Dear Archie Yuille, I don't know
you a d have never met you. I have taken a ticket in
the St. A’ban’s distribution and feel that I shall win
Wallace. This is to authorise you to race the horse on
my account as you may think pioper, and remit the
winnings to yours truly, .” The Port Darwin person
didn’t slate the number of his ticket.

Waterfall’s capture of Caulfield Cup for
Leviathan Oxenham was full of merit, inasmuch as he
and his stable mate, Solanum, were last the first lime past
the stand. The three-year-old made up a lot of lost
ground gradually, and when he got up with the tiring
leaders it was ail over. The fact of being at a graveyard
price the night previous show ed how the public stood off
him. Even his owner did not have a very big win, and
the hooks practically enjoyed a skinner through the suc-
cess of their brother peuciller’s horse.

The Chipping Norton stable evidently had a
great opinion of Hopscotch’s pacing powers when, despite
his 141 b. penally, they instructed Elteridge to win Caul-
field Cup from end to end. The pace was such a scorcher,
too, that failure at the distance gave no cause for wonder.

One feature of the result of the Cup was that
the placed three claimed relation with the one mare,
Frailty. Niagara (sire of Waterfall) and Trenton (sire of

On her running in Caulfield Cup, Quiver will
probably be Chipping Norton’s hope in Melb. Cup, but
Hopscotch will be ridden a different race. The Admiral
may shine to advantage at Flemington, and if well his
fourth in the mud, with a big weight, in Glenloth’s year,
will not be forgotten. Preston, too, who finished seventh
on Saturday, may be expected to shape better over two
miles.

Trotting—a sport which The Bulletin has ever
tried to fosier—has taken on once again at Lilliebridge, :
where the Messrs. Spencer are giving a weekly night-trot. |
The presence of such fast cattle as Edith, Coolgardie,
Cleveland, Jack, Daniel Dennis, and others, makes the
winner pretty hard to pick. Two trotting riders were i
“ sent up” for life the other day, which looks as if the j
proprietors mean to keep the sport “ correct.”
Mr. “Johnny’ Deeble promises to open the |
Lady Robinson’s Beach track next month, when a trot
will be one of the events of the Monday afternoon meet-
ings. The track is a half-mile, and if the event “gees” it
will probably draw back from M.L. some of the Sydney I
trotters which are not doing over well across the water .
just now.
And if owners behave with anything like
decency it is not altogether off the cards that the pro-
prietary clubs may even once more try a trot at their
pony meetings.
At the recent Cue race-meeting .£9OO were given
in prizes. The totalisator patronage amounted to over
£3OOO.

Zimmerman on training summarized ;
1. Abstain from alcohol and smoking. Alcohol heats
the blood ; smoking depresses tiie heart.
2. Begin training, on 'the road, say, from 20 to 30 miles
a day. Take it easy at first, gradually getting into fast
work.
8. Training by walking and running exercise is not
necessary to the cyclist. Train on your machine.
4. Never train before breakfast. An engine cannot
work without fuel.
5. Hand-rubbing—or massage—after exercise is the
best method of benefiting the muscles and working off
flesh.
6. As to diet—avoid potatoes, and the less you drink
the better.
7. Saltw-ater bathing is the best, using a sponge. Few
benefit by the cold-water bath.
8. Rest when the season is over.
Zimmerman never crosses his machine in winter.

Megs on’s alleged time, 2-11 3-6 sec., for the mile,
at Adelaide, is most questionable. Not one of the riders
engaged thought it as fast as even 20seo. longer, and
when Megson was told of the official time he remarked
that he wasn’t having any. It was a slow-run race against
the wind.
* * * •
Zimmerman himself says that the Australian
climate quite suits him, and that he is so well now that he
gains weight in spite of training. But, after the scienti-
fically-dished tracks he has been used to, he expects that
the Australian flat-grasi tracks will much hamper him.

By the way, we want not too much Zimmer-

“ Loyal Australian,” in the Argus, objects to
sending a ’96 Australian team to England—the poorness
Of available talent, he says, ensures failure, financially
and otherwise; he suggests waiting till ’9B. The
same objection could have been urged against
any Australian team whatever, for, with the excep-
tion of the ’B2 eleven, England always had indi-
vidually better men than Australia even the 82
eleven was only better in bowler Spot- and wicket-keeper
Blackham. Moreover, when one Australian eleven played
so badly that the English got tired of recording its
defeats, that eleven netted over £4OO per man. Since
Spofforth’s star set and Turner grew stale, Australia has
been praying for a mighty bowler, and it seems time that
the clergy put in their spare days in imploring for this
long-fell want.

Though Placke, defeated in the giants’ fight,
Progresses towards recovery, his comprehension is not
yet “all there.” He remembers little of the great
disturbance ; he can recall the first blow he got on the
jaw in the first round, and the uppercut on the jaw in the
fourth round ; and he remembers smashing Barker over
the eye. Throughout the fight, Placke felt no pain nor
did he grow weak or feel down at all. He doesn’t re-
member walking out of the ring to the dressing-room.
He has suffered no pain since being in the hospital, and
when visitors have bored him with talk he has found it

This is a true story of one of the big prizes in
the Sydney Eight-Hour Art Union. A man handed his
wife a shilling and told her casually that she might as
well take a ticket. She put the coin away and presently
forgot all about it. At last, a day or two before the
drawing, she had been out shopping, and with a load of
small parcels she got into the wrong tram for home.
While she was being whirled away in the wrong direction
a soiled youth climbed on board, nearly breaking his neck
in the process, and offered tickets for sale. She felt for
her purse but it stuck fast in her pocket, and before she
could get it out a fat man opposite bought the offered
ticket. Then she spilt the contents of the purse on the
floor, and while she was picking them up an angular
woman took the next ticket. When she had finally
gathered up her money and settled her back hair which
had come adrift, she bought the last ticket which the
soiled youth had left, and won a big prize with it. And
now she wants to know where she would have been it she
hadn’t got into the wrong car, or if the fat man and the
lean woman hadn’t intervened, or if she hadn’t forgotten
the matter in the first place, or if a lot of other things
hadn’t happened.

hunters, deputationists, and such folk than even
the Minister himself. Collins was a born diplo-
matist, and could be trusted to adroitly “pump”
and gracefully shunt even the most distinguished
of bores. He occupied a truly confidential posi-
tion, and was one of the most popular and widely-
known identities of the N.S.W. civil service.
Dear Bulletin, —In reply to Mr. Charles
Hedley’s query as to the Northern limit of the
platypus: I know of one instance where the
platypus has been found within the tropics. Quite
recently a sou of Mr. John M'Pherson, of Rook-
wood, killed one in Mellaleuca Creek, where they
I are said to exist in numbers. Mellaleuca Creek
' runs into the Fitzroy about 20 miles from where
the platypus was killed. There are no alligators,
so far as I am aware, in the creek, though they are
fairly plentiful in the Fitzroy. The locality I
refer to is about due west of Rockhampton, and a
few miles north of the Tropic of Capricorn. I
have heard of the platypus being found much
further north than Mellaleuca Creek.—J.T.S.B.,
Rockhampton, Oct. 14, ’95.

RESTORED TO HEALTH
BY THE USE OF
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. Camming, of Yarraville,
Victoria, Australia, says;
“About a year ago, I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in life. Ob-
taining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to me,
I finally tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and from
that time, I began to gain health and strength.
I continued the treatment until fully recov-
ered, and now have very great pleasure in
telling my friends of the merits of Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla, and the happy results of its use. I
consider it the best blood-purifier known.”

“ It Is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
Seat benefit my little daugh-
r Gladys has derived from
•Benger's Food.’ The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her tothe
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended 1 Benger’s
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
"If every mother knew of

A woman has been discovered in Southern
N.S.W. who, though nearer 60 years of age than
50, has a five-months-old baby of her own.
Attention is hereby drawn to the advertise-
ment of the Australian Mutual Provident Society,
appearing in another column, intimating that all
policies issued before the end of the year will share
in the division of profits to be made as at 31st
December next. The amount of cash bonus dis-
tributed among the members for the single year,
1894, was nearly half-a-million sterling, which is,
we understand, a larger amount of profit for one
year than has ever been realised or divided by
any other Life office in the British Empire. The
Society’s prospectus, containing tables of rates for
a number of new benefits, can now be obtained
on application, and intending proposers should
procure a copy and carefully consider the same,
the tables of rates for assurances under which
members participate in the profits of the Society-
being properly distinguished from those for non-
participating policies.
William Ryan, the Australian actor, remi-
nisces about Lola Montes. She was an Irish girl,
but long simulation had given her absolute com-
mand of an attractive' broken English, and her
intimacy with the King of Bavaria destroyed
whatever she had previously known of her own
language. This Irish-Bavarian-Spanish-Melican
woman arrived in Australia in ’57, in which year
Ryan supported her at the Haymarket, Bendigo,
under Hy. Coleman’s management. Lola’s star
part —she thought it so, anyhow—was as herself in
their specially-written drama—Ryan being the
King of Bavaria. Lola was tall and willowy—a
sparkling, languorous, and yet hard-eyed brunette
—and she had the temper of seven devils. She
smoked cigarettes throughout rehearsal, and
alternately bullied and petted Follande, who was
her lord and tame eat at that time. One morning
shesaid, “ What is the time, Folly, dear?” “Folly
dear ” pulled out his watch very lazily, but ere
he could open it she had torn it out of
his hand, dashed it on the stage and broken
it under her heel. Two hours later the impulsive
Lola spent .£5O on a new watch for “Folly.”
Some miners asked her to christen a new claim.
This she did, getting gloriously drunk in the
process. That night she was “paralytic,”
missed her lines, staggered down to the footlights
and remarked to the audience that the King of
Bavaria —hie—had not given her one correct cue,
and that the King of Bavaria was very—hie—
drunk. The audience applauded. Ryan came
down the stage and stated that he was quite sober,
and that Lola Montes was exceedingly drunk.
The audience again applauded and called for a
repetition, Bendigo Mac offering .£5O if the scene
were kept up for five minutes. In 12 nights at
Bendigo the receipts were .£2400, Manager Cole-
man and Montes sharing equally. Lola was so
extravagant that her balance for the fortnight
was 13s. From Bendigo she went to Ballarat and
horsewhipped a newspaper man named Senior for
making rude remarks. Next day Mrs. Senior
gave Lola “ the father and mother of a hiding.”
In another Bendigo season Lola played the name-
part in “ Asmodeus.” During the performance
an awful storm raged, and the danger was in-
creased by the quantity of standing timber around
the theatre. Lightning struck the building,
making a hole 2ft. in diameter in the iron roof.
The lightning ran along the girders and dogs
and knocked the side of the stage right out,
set fire to the paint-room and workshop and
shattered a piece of timber 14 inches in diameter.
Eight people were standing near this post, but all
escaped. An actor named Robert M'Gowan ran
across the stage, bent almost double, his fingers in
his ears. He escaped through the shattered wall,
ran to his hotel and locked himself in his room,
and, as he refused to come out again that night,
they finished the show without him. Yet Lola
Montes came cool and smiling to the footlights
and said, in her “faked” broken English, “Ladies
and gentlemen, I have played the part of the little
devil often before, but never to such realistic
thunder and lightning.” But the peril had been
too close for burlesque, and the audience hissed
her. This remarkable woman died in great
poverty in America. She deserted Follande in
Australia. He followed her by the next steamer,
but suicided by jumping off the ship in mid-ocean,

STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, in the Colony of New
South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows ; Whereas I suffered severely from
a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was quite unable to
attend to my business. I tried several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as
a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alfaline Vitality Pills,”
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured Me within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. The Alfaline Pills also
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.—
THOS. MTJDIMAN,
Subscribed and declared at Sydney this 23rd day of November, 1891, before me. —S. T. Whiddon,

mony carries special weight, writes thus :To Herr Rassmussen.— Dear Sir,-I think it my duty to

and, in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their
use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper o(
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies- to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Should the alleged Dean conspirators be
committed, application may possibly be made that
a Judge from a neighboring province shall be
borrowed ” to preside at the trial.
At time of writing, the question of the
vacant Q. Judgeship looks like an Orange v.
Green matter. Premier Nelson, son of an Orange
clergyman, is credited with wanting to appoint a
past Attorney-General (Rutledge); Attorney-
Gen. Byrnes would like to elevate Virgil Power.
Prahran (Vic.) Woman’s Franchise League
the other evening digested a lectuyette on “ Who
rules : Man or Woman ? ” The lecturer strung a
bead-roll with the names of historically-famous
females who had ruled man in the past, and
wound up by observing that, when man u'us
ruled, it was generally by women of unmoral
character. The only exception to this rule, he
genially remarked, was possibly Adam. Alter
this, the W.F.L. listened to his discourse in stony
silence.
Mr. H. Sillier, saddler and harness-
maker and importer, of 135 Sussex-stroet, Sydney,
issues a remarkably complete catalogue, winch
will be found of great value by customers m the
remote parts of Australia. It quotes prices for
every possible article in the saddlery and harness
line, and, as the catalogue is lavishly illustrated,
the bush purchaser can select what he wants with
as much tine discrimination as the buyer on the
spot. The prices, when compared with those or a
few years ago, show how utterly the bottom has
fallen out of the business ; most of the goods sell
at what, not so very long since, would have been
regarded as ruinous prices. Quotations are also
given for freight, packing, &c., so that the buyer
at Coolgardie, or Kimberley, or Port Darwin, or
down by the Great Australian Bight, can calcu-
late to a nicety the cost delivered at his own front
door.
The demand for “ Crom-a-boo ” has neces-
sitated a fourth edition, which is now in the press.#
From the scientific standpoint, the fact
that the woman Williams was enceinte when she
deliberately drowned her little boy, at Melbourne,
is sufficient ground for supposing that she was
mentally unhinged. The immense influence ot
physiological conditions is a factor in feminine
crime too little recognised. It accounts for much
female fractiousness, fickleness, general ‘con-
trariness,” and other more serious forms of in-
sanity amongst women. Nevertheless, they are
going to hang the woman Williams. And may
the Lord have mercy on their souls !

“Go to the sergeant— he’ll give you a feed.”
“Look here, stranger, I’d give a bit to have you

Dear Bulletin,-— Many interesting cere-
conn?°^ed with the death and burial of
N.S.W. aborigines have not been noticed by the
authorities quoted by Mr. J. Steele Robertson. I
can only speak with personal knowledge of the
aborigines of Burragorang and Mulgoa. I dis-
tinctly remember the death of a young black-boy
in Burragorang about 36 years ago, and shall
never forget the soul-piercing death-cry raised by
the gins, and how all the blackfellows, several of
whom were burning-off timber for my father,
threw down their tools and, taking up the wail,
ran over to the camp. The dead boy’s mother sat
on the ground and hacked herself with a tomahawk;
then she smeared her face with white pipeclay
and glued her hair together with it, and in this
ghastly state of mourning, her head covered with
terrible wounds, she remained for several weeks.
1 was not present at the funeral, but remember
that two mounds, or make-believe graves, were
raised near the real grave—one on either side —
the object in making three graves being to puzzle
the evil spirit who comes to dig up the corpse.
The aborigines of Burragorang always carved a
number of Y-shaped characters on a tree near the
grave, and if they saw these characters imitated
on a tree by a white they became angry, and
immediately obliterated them. The Burragorang
aborigines strongly objected to the presence of
white men during their burial ceremonies, and
nothing distressed them more than to sympathise
with them, or even mention the name of the
deceased. After a death they at once shifted
camp.—H. J. M‘Gooey.
Dear Bulletin, —“A Wet Day” in a
recent issue strikes a chord of my memory. I was
at Zeehan when things were humming on our
silverfields. It was nearly always raining there,
and Zeehanites (perhaps as a consequence) used to
swear more than enough. Their champion “lan-
guage men ” were at their best when they were at
their wildest —say at 11.30 p.in., when whisky and
weather had done their utmost to produce the last
possibility in the way of moisture. In Zeehan’s
one street one rainy night at this particular hour,
I spotted a man 1 had met in the morning. He
was dry when we were introduced, but he was
swearing and boasting most promisingly, so when
I saw him leaning against another man’s door,
thoroughly soaked inside and out, I considered it
worth while giving him a hearing. He was in-
veighing against the Zeehanites when I stopped
to listen. He called them by the most objection-
able names, and asked with a yell if they could
hear. Then he paused for a reply, but getting
none, continued : “I’ll walk any blanky man in
Zeehan ; I’ll swag any blanky man in Zeehan;
I 11 run any blanky man in Zeehan ; I’ll jump any
blanky man in Zeehan ; I’ll fight any blanky man
in Zeehan ; I’ll blanky well any blanky man
in Zeehan, and if Goddlemighty comes down I’ll
take a round out of him.” Three days after this I
saw him in a friend’s hut, catching devils and con-
fining them in jam-tins. He’d got ’em bad. We had
27 wet days at Zeehan in one month—that wasn’t
the record by any means. And we had our
“ language men,” yet one policeman managed the
whole field for a considerable time, and might
have continued there in a minority of one if
“refinement” had never found its way to our
West Coast. The Zeehanites boasted and drank
and swore and challenged and threatened from
morning till nearly midnight, but their one police-
man wasn’t overworked. The man who heard
overnight from threatening lips that there would
be “a fresh face in Hell in less than two minutes,”
invariably turned up for his “ doctor ” in the
morning, and evidently felt as he drank it that he
was amongst men and brothers and hadn’t an
enemy in the world. —Theta.

A SPECIALTY
For INFANTS
Specially prepared for the delicate
Shin of Ladies and Children.
Imparts and maintains a soft, velvety
condition of the Skin, and prevents
Redness, Roughness, & Chapping.
Professor SIR ERASMUS WILSON,
(Late President of the Royal College oj Surgeons , England.')
" The use of a good Soap is certainly calculated to
preserve the skin in health, to maintain its complexion
and tone, and prevent its falling into wrinkles. Pears
is a name engraven on the memory of the oldest inhabi-
tant ; and Pears* Soap is an article of the nicest
and most careful manufacture, and one of the most
refreshing and agreeable balms for the skin,”
The independent testimony of Scientific Experts
fl nd the most eminent Shin Specialists award it
the first piaoe among Toilet Soaps.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
'• Get up, Bolly 1 ”
He sat sideways on the rear horse as the two
tired beasts walked slowly up through the orchard
to the stable. The lead harness was on their
backs, the swingletrees hung on the hames ; they
paced forward stolidly, the day’s work done.
He had been ploughing ; the sod, neither too
wet nor too dry, had turned a beautifully-even
furrow. For ten hours he had held the handles
and seen the earth ridge up with mechanical regu-
larity. The rising scent of the fresh soil seemed
to breathe comfort, and, as the day wore on, he
felt the subtle intoxication of the senses which
Nature in generous moods grants to her intimates.
The breeze was laden with the perfume of orange-
blossoms; the bees hummed gleefully, content with
the harvest they were reaping; and the busy wag-
tails followed his heels in the furrow. All seemed
to bid him rejoice in life and work.
So he had gone on, hour after hour, in a kind of
walking dream, watching the mould-board throw
over the long strips of turf with the neatness and
regularity of a ruler. It was one of those har-
monious days when the mind seems lulled into
ecstacy, when the blood is in the muscles and the
brain rests.
The sun was going down when the sound of
knocking on a milk-pan at the house warned him
supper was ready. He unhitched the horses, and,
seated on Tom’s broad back, rested there quietly
while the tired animals, ungnided, followed the
familiar path. Now he felt appetite come to him,
with the sudden craving and regularity given by
physical toil. His supper of corned-beef and
pumpkin would be to him as a banquet. He
hurried the horses.
As he drew near the house, he could hear the
sound of his wife’s voice in the kitchen.
“Now, Sid, you go and chop that wood this
minute; you lazy good-for-nothing ! ”
“ I shan’t.”
“How dare you; you youner villain! I will
call your father to strap you.”
The man’s face clouded as he listened. “ I had
best keep out of this,” he muttered, as, avoiding
the house, he turned off by a longer road to the
stable. But he could not escape the sound of con-
tending voices ; as he retreated, they grew louder
and louder; and before he had unharnessed and
fed the horses his wife was at the stable-door.
“Come to this boy, father, and strap him. I
can stand his impudence no longer.” The woman
spoke excitedly.
Slowly the man finished his work, slowly he
walked to the kitchen where the boy, surly and
defiant, sulked in a corner.
“ Do as your mother bids you, Sid.”
“ I won’t.”
The man reached to the wall and took down his
razor-strop, his steady hand trembling. Then,
taking by the hand the boy, who began to scream,
he raised the strap in the air.
“I told you what you’d get, my boy !” said the
mother, triumphantly.
The strap came down, the boy yelled ; but it
was the man’s body that quivered at the stroke.
Three stripes the boy had received, when the
mother rushed forward and interposed, lacing her
arms about the lad.
“ Oh, you brute, to hit a poor child like thatt
Oh, you coward! My poor darling ! Did hi s
cruel father hit him with a strap? My precious
one ! He wants to kill you ; he is not fit to be a
father. My pet! Let me see where he has hit
yon, my lovely.”
The man threw down the strap ; and, leaving
his supper uncasted, returned to the stable-loft.
Here he turned to the chaff-cutter and wearily
ground sorghum-stalks into horse-feed. Far into
the night could be heard the monotonous, tearing
sound of the revolving knives ; but the darkness
of the shed hid from view the falling chaff, and
the tears that dried slowly on the man’s set face.

George Nathaniel Curzon, one of Salis-

daughter of Loiter, a millionaire, who began life
as a window-cleaner in a N.Y. drapery.
In the defence of Jabez Balfour, it is to be
pleaded that Jabez hasn’t come within the British
courts’ jurisdiction, because he wasn’t properly
extradited from Argentina. It’s quite possible
the court may discover that, whilst the body of
Jabez is in the dock, his redeemed soul has been
left on the foreign shore, in which case the law
will take out a warrant for the arrest of the flabby
saint’s spiritual nature and make another appeal
to the Argentine authorities.
More Deeming Curse. A young man
travelled on a steamboat along with the hairy-
eared criminal shortly before Ids arrest, and
became somewhat intimate with him. As they
neared land, Deeming lent him his opera-glass with
which to view the scenery, and also shook hands
with him at parting. Then that young man went
ashore and broke a blood-vessel, and lay between
life and death for weeks. He revived sufficiently
to be removed to his home, but fell into a slow
decline, and, the other day, he died. He had en-
joyed good health until Deeming lent him his
opera-glass.
In Ginscin and Isis districts (Queensland) are many
Kanaka farmers and small planters legally married to
white women, who appear quite proud of the alliance,
and unashamed of their mud-colored, mongrel offspring.
Many other women have deserted white husbands to
become the concubines of the lusty niggers.
TO A KANAKA SWAIN.
I love your strong and brawny arm,
Your glossy hide of ebon ;
Your pretty little freehold farm,
Your purse, the dress, the ribbon.
I can endure your charming smell,
For you are still a man a
Lady may admire right well,
My darling Tommy Tanna.
The planter in his mood of sin
Has still an eye to cast on
A buxom, comely Island gin
To whom he fastens fast on.
And you’re a planter, though you’re black
You swear you love—how can a
White girl turn on you her back.
Dear, wealthy Tommy Tanna?
For you’re the saviour of our land,
Our industry you cherish
Were you from Queensland ever banned
The sugar-cane would perish.
I love the country—l love you,
Come to my arms, Alamia,
You’ll find me constant, leal, and true,
My charming Tommy Tanna !

N.Q. wedding orator : —“ Ladies and gen-
tlemen, —I must tell you I ham not much of a
hauditor, but will—hie—say a few words. You
see my right-hand supporter, Mrs. Blank. Well,
me and her his the boldest cohabitants in the
township ! ”
The fishing township of Hastings, Yic., is
in the throes of a bad attack of Mormonism, and
already has a fair-sized congregation of Latter-
day Saints. Hastings is a hysterical place that
changes its religion at the bidding of each wander-
ing revivalist. It began with a sort of general
nondescript paganism. A weird Presbyterian
came along one day, and Hastings became afflicted
with Calvinism. Then a wild-eyed Baptist fell
over it one dark night, and Hastings renounced
Calvin and all his works. After a Methodist
camp-meeting, in the ti-tree, Hastings went to
live in the tents of Wesley and Whitfield. Next,
a Latter-day Saint was washed up by the tide,
and, just to show it had no ill-feeling, Hastings
promptly adopted Joe Smith and Brigham Young.
Probably the next course will be one of Confucius
or Buddha, unless Bob Ingersoll happens to go
fishing in the neighborhood.
There is quite an exodus of Tasmanian
artisans to Johannesburg, and the Island
daily press raises a mournful hullabaloo about
it. The intending emigrants are duly warned
that distant fields look green, also that they
should think twice before giving up “a com-
fortable home ” in exchange for “a place where
the blacks labor for Is. fid. a day and the chances
for artisans are few and far apart,” likewise that
they should “go on the land.” To go on the land
in any of the without a safe bank
behind one and a heart as big as a post-office, is
bad enough in all conscience, remarks a Bulletin
correspondent, but to go on the land in Tasmania
is simply Hades with all the dampers off. Owing
to the peculiar facilities offered to and availed of
by the “first families” to pick the eyes out
of the country, the Crown lands of Tasmania
to-day contain less land to the acre than any
other Crown lands known of, and a man
who would tackle the task of carving a farm out
of solid basalt or carboniferous limestone orna-
mented witli wattle-scrub and prickly Moses, must
possess a stouter heart and a smaller brain than
the average Tasmanian owns, anyhow. Those who
have the good farming land keep it sacred to
sheep, while the hopeless agriculturist who doesn’t
know how to farm and doesn’t want to learn,
messes round on a miserable mortgaged freehold
with out-of-date appliances, and works like a slave
from year’s end to year’s end, in order to pay rent
for land leased from a descendant of one or other
of the first families aforementioned, to whom he
religiously touches his hat. The worst of it is that
the poor wretches don’t seem to have any burning
desire to improve things, but regard with perfect
equanimity the rejection of the Constitution Bill—
to abolish plural voting and extend the franchise
—the ditto of the Eight-hour Bill, the ditto of the
Land-tax Bill, by the Upper House, and the
loving recep ion given by the same House to a
Hobart tramway snavel, or the land-grab of the
Waratah-Zeehan Railway Co. Despite the much-
boomed activity in mining, the industry is em-
ploying very few men, and these are manacled in
approved V.D.L. fashion by absurd restrictions.
Bent’s Terror .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the daily papers and other forms of popular
fiction, one is continually meeting with the indi-
vidual who has or had a foreboding of his own
doom—the sailor, soldier, jockey, or gymnast,
who has a conviction that he is going to meet his
death on a certain spot, at a particular hour, under
stipulated conditions. In the book we find the
prognostication amply verified in the last chapter
but one; in the newspaper the death of the indi-
vidual recalls the astonishingly accurate forecast.
Possibly Curly Bent was affected by this class
of literature. Curly was boss of our shift in the
Bald Eagle, and he appeared to be perfectly
satisfied in his own mind that he was going to be
killed “one of those days ” under a certain set of
timber in the main drive, about fifty yards from
the plat. There was nothing about the timber on
the ground to suggest this unpleasant idea, and
that particular set did not differ from any other
set in the drive, but Bent clung to his conviction,
and refused to be comforted or to give it up in
spite of reason and argument.
He avoided the fatal set as much as possible, and
blanched visibly every time he passed between the
logs. He used to say that if he were carried along
the drive in the pitch dark he could find the
dreaded spot by the awful chill that struck to his
heart whenever he got near it.
One night I saw him land on the plat, dead
white, and quaking like a man in an ague fit.
“ She is goin’ to get me to-night, Tim ! ” he said
to the platman.
However, Bent continued to live, and, as he re-
fused to throw up his job, his foreboding became
a stock joke below, and the dreaded set was known
as “ Bent’s Terror.”
In the course of time the company decided to
have the trucking done by horse-power, and two
men a shift were put on to excavate a large cham-
ber for stables, the spot selected being exactly
opposite “Bent’s Terror.” The work had ad-
vanced considerably without mishap until oneafter-
noon Curly, who had just come below, was standing
in the chamber. He was surveying the work done
by the last shift, when, without a crack or a hint
of warning, about twenty tons of stuff from over
the drive and the mouth of the chamber came
down plump, with a roar that brought the white-
faced men blundering and stumbling along the
drive, wild with excitement.
The work of rescue was begun at once, and
Bent’s foreboding was recalled with awe and deep
respect. We found two men crushed and dead,
and the third blown back against the wall, jammed
in a space where he had not room to move six
inches one way or another, but living, and with-
out a scratch.
Bent died in his bed six years later, of rheuma-
tic gout

According to M'Gregor, the Papuan bobby is ex-
tremely zealous, showing himself anxious to arrest
everybody (“making many and regretable mis-
takes ”) he can lay his hands on. If he can only
succeed in cultivating a brogue he may yet
possibly emulate the proceedings of his Australian
brethren—even to the extent of raising a “ terrace

" Cruel as the Grave ."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They were only newly married, too. That
Was the worst of it. A still substantial remnant
of wedding-cake was deposited by the clattering
steward each afternoon on the small corner table
of the saloon, in company with a dainty picnic-
basket—“ wedding present ” stamped unmistake-
ably on its plated teapot and monogram-adorned
leather strap.
The sting lay in the contrast of present neglect
to the little triumphs of maidenhood. I have seen
quite a crowd of satellites round this girl as her
young beauty shone out in a ball-room. I have
heard the boys chattering about her at the club
and remarked their efforts to become introduced.
They soon fell away from their allegiance, but
there were plenty more to fill their places. Her
beauty was of a kind that attracts strongly but
cannot retain admiration,
“She palls,” I heard one young fellow explain
briefly, after a week’s devotion.
This she did not know until she married, and
she married a man peculiarly prone to satiety.
He could not speak to a woman without his over
powering weakness showing itself in the large
dilating pupils of his dark, feverish eyes. The
other woman saw that look when first she smiled
at him, but she smiled none the less for it.
His wife was certainly in love, but it was the
passion that had possessed him which she loved
and not the man himself, and what she loved had
burnt itself out during the honeymoon. All
she lived for was to see it kindle again, but she
could strike no spark.
The bride took her seat opposite me at meal-
times, but I doubt if she so much as noticed my
existence. She had no ears or eyes save for her
husband. She heard all he said and she followed
his eyes as they travelled restlessly among our
lady passengers until they met one other pair.
The other woman sat' at the end of the table near
the door, and his eyes and hers met and spoke at
every meal.
• * «
There came an evening when half-way
through dinner she looked him full in the face,
rose and slipped out. I don’t know if the wife
saw it. The husband pushed away his plate and
put his hand to his head. “ I have a bad head-
ache,” he said. “I shall go into the air for a
second. “ No,” he added sharply as she started
to follow him. “ Stay where you are. . I hate a
fuss.”
She sat down again without a word, but she
sent away each course untasted. He did not
return.
From that day a new intensity of longing filled
her face and quivered on her lips. It became an
invariable custom for the husband to leave her
with a flimsy apology to the solitary completion of
her dinner. . Once she rose and accompanied him
in spite of his impatient “Can’t you let me be
alone for five minutes?”
“ I have a headache, too,” she said.
“Then you had better go to your cabin and I
will send the stewardess to you.’’
She followed him from the saloon, but when I
went on deck I caught a glimpse of her white face
as she passed me, walking rapidly up and down
the deck, alone. After that she sat through
dinner.
• # •
One night she came into the saloon with
a face like death. Her husband was not with her,
and further down the table was another vacant
place. Her eyes were fixed and dazed as she
helped herself to each dish in turn, but never
raised a fork to her lips. I loaned across and
spoke to her—some light, jesting remark to turn
away the attention of curious passengers. I
laughed at my own sally, but my solitary laugh
struck jarringly on my ears. She shuddered
slightly, but made no further sign of having heard.
She wore a light shawl over her shoulders, and
her full white neck gleamed through it. Her
fingers, where the rings flashed, twitched nervously
at the white wool. With a sudden start she drew
it closer round her and rose to her feet. I watched
her out of the room, turned with some remark to
my neighbor, and presently I arose too and res ched
the door. There was the sound of soft laughter
and two voices :
“ I am ashamed to go in ; we are so late.”
“ But we are hungry,” objected the other.
“And appetite, you think, must conquer
shame," said the woman half bitterly.
I hung back till they entered the saloon, then I
rushed up the companion. It needed no searching
to find that little white-clad figure. She seemed
to have shrunk together as she sat crouched upon
the rail, one arm round the post and both hands
clasping her breast. She loosed her arms and
smiled softly like a child as it falls asleep. I was
still yards away when she swayed gently back-
wards to meet a great wave that swept foaming
from the bows.

According to a Footscray (Melb.) corres-

are in so pitiable a plight that householders are
driven to make soup of their rent-books !
Birmingham (Eng.) Gazette publishes a
sublime effusion from “ A Disgusted Dunedin
Emigrant,” who quotes a “rev. gentleman” as
saying that “the circumstances of Maoriland have
produced a race of unapproachable and irreclaim-
able blackguards which indeed has developed all
the baser human passions and appetites, and well-
nigh forsaken all ideas of religion and humanity.”
That parson must have lived in Scottish Dunedin,
where the canny Hielander changes his “ tanner ”
for threepenny-bits before going to the kirk.
A man down South, charged with wife-assault the

only recently his wife had made these complaints. He
was afraid that she no longer cared for him. The tender

A Thames (M.L.) woman, charged jointly
with her husband with having caused the death
of their two-year-old child through neglect, asked

said the officer. “ That’s a pity—it’s my washing-
day ! ” An ideal woman !
The Vic. Agent-General reports that theirn-
ports of Australian wine into Great Britain for the
first six months of ’95 amounted to 267,000ga15.,
compared with 396,000ga15. for the whole of last
year. The wines are mostly blended. Messrs.
Burgoyne and co. now sell about 350,000ga15.
annually. It is cabled that the Vio. vignerons
have scored splendidly at Bordeaux Exhibition,
gaining five gold medals and many other awards.
When is there to he an English society,
witli a pure-bred Smith for its first president, and
a Baker, or an Edmond, or some such distinctively
Saxon-named person in the vice-chair? The latest
anti-English organisation started in Great Britain
is a Clan Donnachaidt Society, the avowed object
of which is the fostering of clan sentiment. This
sort of thing threatens to go on until the ‘‘sub-
merged tenth ” will be composed solely of unfor-
tunate Englishmen, whose ancestors were elbowed
aside by co-operating brethren of various breeds.
An Englishman’s only chance to earn his daily
bread fifty years hence will be in joining a reli-
gious clique. If he doesn’t take up with the
Wesleyans or Baptists, he’ll fall a victim to the
stick-together sentiment of Scotchmen, Irishmen,
Jews, Germans, and Welshmen.

what he has lost. He has
LOST a Crown ; he has
LOST a Harp ; he has
LOST a Throne ; he has
LOST a Heaven ; he has
LOST an Eternity.
When I consider how happy a soul may he, it appears
to me to be a tremendous thing for it to be lost, even
though it should gain the world; in fact, I cannot set the
world in contrast; it is as though I should measure the

Examination questions for women desirous
of the franchise : Can you pour out half a cup of
tea? Can you refrain from putting milk and
sugar in it if so required? Can you tie a knot of
any description that will hold ? Gan you sharpen
a knife on a steel ? Can you throw a stone and
hit anything? Can you keep your temper, and is
it worth keeping? When looking at a horse can
you refrain from calling the animal “ she ” and
saying that it has “ a lovely tail ? ” Do you ever
attend wonderful sales of bargains at drapers’
shops and buy old stock, supposed to be slightly
damaged, at twice its proper value? (Answering
this question in the affirmative at once disqualifies
the candidate). Do you read the evidence in
divorce and other oases when it is spicy ? Did
you ever squeeze into a court of justice to watch a
man being tried for his life? Do you belong to
the gimlet society ?
My sweet, my soul, when we are wed,
And just a little older grown,
You’ll not forget the words you’ve said,
But still remain my ownest own ;
My own to fondle and caress,
Mine, mine to cherish and amuse,
And mine to kiss and cuddle —yes,
My own to jump on if I choose.
Dear love, they say these tender troths
That lovers plight are soon forgot;
They say—the unbelieving Goths !
That youthful loves will cool a lot;
But you will steadfast be and true,
And ne’er dispute, when time has flown,
My right to kick you black and blue
When I am drunk, my dear, my own.
How I Was Had.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr acquaintance with the confidence-trick was
gained in this way.
I had stowed my swag in my bunk, and was loiter-
ing about on the fo’o’sle waiting for the steamer
to get under weigh. We were leaving Melbourne
for Coolgardie, and, within half-an-hour of going
aboard, a bronzed six-footer and myself had
become mates to make our fortunes in the far
West. My new mate’s name was Charlie
M'Ardell, and he came from Eohuca. Charlie’s
sisters were going with him as far as Perth, but
something had happened to detain them. They
were to arrive from Echuca at 11 a.m., and it was
nearly mid-day; so it was a great relief to Charlie
when he found the boat would not leave until
evening.
After lunch, Charlie proposed a trip up town to
pass the time. I had ,£57 on me, which I did not
care to carry about. I mentioned this to Charlie,
and in an off-handed manner he said, ‘‘Put it in
my box under lock and key ” —which I did, keep-
ing out £4.
We sauntered round, and whilst doing Bourke-
street a third person joined us; he shook hands
with Charlie and gave me a nod. It appeared
he had charge of the gfirls from Echuca, and
had put them aboard the boat. He had paid
travelling expenses amounting to £3 65., and as
Charlie had only brought a few shillings with
him, I paid the stranger this amount. After
receiving the money he bade us a hurried farewell,
as he had to catch the train for Lilydale. Then
Charlie suddenly remembered he had some friends
in Bast Melbourne to whom he wished to say
goodbye, and left me to find my way back to the
boat by myself.
I got on board at 5 p.m. and went to my cabin.
My swag was there, but the box had disappeared,
and there was no sign of the girls. I thought the
matter over for half-an-hour, and soon saw the
trick that had been played on me.
However, making my way aft to get ashore for
a detective, I saw Charlie talking to two girls,
who proved to be his sisters. The box had been
transferred from our cabin to the girls’ cabin in
the saloon.
We had a merry trip, and before reaching our
destination the eldest sister determined to have
me for better or for worse. And that is how I
was had.
