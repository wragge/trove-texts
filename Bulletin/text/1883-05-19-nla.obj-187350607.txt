Blasphemy, or—What ?
Political Economy has been styled “ The
Dismal Science,” and every man who has
studied the science must feel the accuracy of
the epithet. Despite the fact that exami-
nation of its problems has engaged the most
lucid intellects of the past century, the
subject remains shrouded in mists of gloomy
uncertainties. While every lateral crevice
and issue has been examined with critical
accuracy, it is perceived that no man has
plumbed the bottom of the abyss. The in-
vestigator, after toilfully penetrating the
mazes, under the direction of the most cele-
brated guides, emerges with a consciousness
that the knowledge he has acquired lacks
coherence and continuity, and has more
excited his imagination than satisfied his
curiosity. The dismal conviction which
weighs upon the student of Political Economy
after he has learnt all that has been demon-
strated, is that the sum of the information
he has acquired is the harrowing assurance
that, no matter how the factors in the
problem be arranged or adjusted, the result
remains that misery and want—the sharpest
misery and the extremest want—arc the inevi-
table lot of a large proportion of every
generation of mankind. This conclusion is
at least latent in every system yet pro-
pounded. The masters of the science have
investigated with powerful and searching
scrutiny every conceivable method by means
©f which the condition of mankind can
be or might be ameliorated. Production,
Distribution, Exchange, Wealth, Credit,
Rents, Profits, and Wages, have each been
considered in their mutual relations. The in-
fluence of a growth of intelligence has been
considered, and the functions of Government
examined. To all these investigations there
have been brought a magnificent candour,
a bright lucidity, and an uncompromising
courage in following the most disheartening
inferences to their absolute conclusions.
And when all has'been done, the inquirer
remains confronted by the appalling, but
apparently unavertable deduction, that the
case of mankind is hopeless. When all minor
issues have been followed to the end, when
©very allowance has been made for the
happiest and wisest conceivable adjustment
of economical and social problems —when
©ven the imaginary Republic of Plato, the
New Atlantis, and the Utopia of More, are
admitted as practically possible, still the
;grim figure of sordid wretchedness looms
over the prospect. The richer the harvest,
the more the mouths; and always more
mouths than mouthfuls. This is the axiom
which has made Political Economy essentially
an impotent science, and has invested it with
its dismal reputation.
The richer the harvest, the more the
mouths; and always more mouths than
mouthfuls. Tacitly assumed by Adam
Smith, this axiom was first formally stated
by the Rev. Mr. Malthus, a clergyman of
the Church of England, and having since
been adopted in its essentials by every con-
siderable Economist and Philosopher, as Ri-
cardo, Mill, and Buckle, it has entered into
the very habits of thought of educated
mankind. In its original extravagance,
the theory of Malthus has been vaunted as
“conclusive as a problem of Euclid,” and
started from an apparently unanswerable
demonstration that, while population tends
to increase in a geometric ratio, subsistence
increases only in an arithmetical ratio. In
other words, while population increases by
multiplication, means of subsistence simulta-
neously increase only by addition. Thus,
while population unchecked by unfavourable
conditions would double its numbers every 52
.years, the means of subsistence would only
increase by a single advance during the same
period. Reduced to figures, Malthus puts
the case that while the human race would
increase as the numbers 1,2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64,
128, 256, substance would only increase at the
rate of 1,2, 3,4, 5,6, 7,8, 91 This fantastic
exactitude is repudiated by later writers,
who, however, adopt the general conclusions.
Thus J. S. Minn refers to it as “an unlucky
attempt to give precision to things which do
not admit of it, which every person capable
of reasoning must see is wholly superfluous
to the argument.” The argument, with-
out the unlucky precision, is adopted by
Minx,, and dominates all his reasoning. Now
this argument is the element which makes
Political Economy dismal, and projects a
gloomy shadow over every prospect of
ameliorating the condition of suffering
humanity.
The fundamental theory, as accepted by
the schoolmen, and the deductions to which
they have lent the weight of their assent,
will require a few sentences. The theory is
that “ there is a natural tendency and
constant effort in population to increase
beyond the means of subsistence.” The
deductions are, once that premise is adopted,
inevitable. The increase of population
must be prevented or restrainc and must
heretofore have constantly been prevented
or restrained, by some opposing influence.
Otherwise the human race would have dis-
appeared from the face of the earth. All must
have starved, unless some had perished or
never been born. The real and peremptory
check to over-population is clearly, there-
fore, starvation. But, as man is gifted with
foresight, and variously endowed with
strength and intelligence, a constant effort
to provide against extinction has been going
on, and a universal scramble for such sub-
sistence as exists. The weakest have been
shouldered away from the loaf and pitcher,
and have perished. That is the case, put in
a simple form. Elaborated, it becomes more
complex. The hungry savage kills his neigh-
bour and eats him. Tribes, as their indi-
viduals increase and their native tract yields
insufficient nourishment, throw off their
superfluous numbers as predatory bands, or
migrate bodily into the country of other
tribes and fight for its possession. Through
the varying complexities of increasing civili-
zation the struggle continues, with modifica-
tions of form. The strong —no matter
whether their strength be physical or de-
rived from artificial advantages—trample
the weak, and nations deplete their brim-
ming populations by wars. There are a
thousand weapons more subtle than the club
of the savage, but all equally fatal. In the
more brutal times, the stronger might have
smothered the weaker in a ditch. Amid a
delicate refinement, the stronger merely
crowds the weaker into the fetid atmosphere
of a slum. The process is physiologically
identical. There is rapid asphyxiation in the
one case; gradual asphyxiation in the other.
The result is the same: the weaker die off,
and the stronger snatch the share which,
insufficient for both, is ample for one.
The horror'of j the situation'lies in its'in-
evitableness. The strong must push the
weak out of existence, or both will perish
together. The natural increase of popula-
tion must be kept down by starvation,
misery, overcrowding, or prudential refusals
to mate, or by slaughter, unles's the whole
race is to wait hand in hand, brotherly
fashion, for extinction. There is no escape
from the dilemma. Charity faints at the
threshold—her tenderness aggravating the
evils she fain would relieve. Progress in
productive processes, invention of machinery
which increase man’s natural powers in pro-
duction of subsistence, are mere tittles when
contrasted with that terrific mathematical
progression which population, if unchecked,
develops. No matter how great the increase
in subsistence, the increase in competitors
for it must ever overrun it. There may be
room for more men and women as produc-
tion is stimulated and: exchange facilitated
by improved methods, but as surely as death
comes to all, so surely must there be a crowd
of famishing hands clutching at every
mouthful which the fortunate few convey
to their mouths. Illustrating the general
case by a particular example. Were the
wealthiest man in England to distribute a
million sterling among a thousand strug-
gling persons, £lOOO to each, in fifty years
the sum of human wretchedness and anxie-
ties would not have abated one whit. Those
persons, wh o while penniless had not dreamed
of marriage, would, on finding themselves in
comparative ease, marry. Children would
thus be called into existence, who otherwise
would never have been born. And these,
again, would wed and beget more children,
till the wealth distributed had been so sub-
divided or dissipated that in lieu of the
original thousand, society was burdened
with ten thousand persons feebly staggering
on the verge of starvation. Distribution of
wealth is therefore futile as a remedy for
human misery; and instead of being, as
modern philosophers have dreamed, and
masses have felt, a measure of relief, would
but intensify the evil by enlarging its scope.
Charity, instead of being a merciful duty, is
a cruel offence against inexorable laws; and
he is perhaps the truest benefactor who
knocks a pauper on the head, or huddles the
poor into pestilential alleys, where their
infants shall wither and die without tasting
the full misery of life. This will appear a
frightful and monstrous series of deductions,
even though the reasoning present no flaw.
It is our own deduction, truly, but not ours
only. By a longer road, and after fuller ex-
Eosition of the steps on the way, John
tuart Mill arrived at the same conclu-
sion. He expressly, and in these very words
attributes the want and suffering which
exist in the world as society is now consti-
tuted, to “the niggardliness of Nature; not
to the injustice of man.”
We reject our own conclusions. We deny
the inference of Mill. Our deductions arc
monstrosities. The deduction of Mill is
atrocious blasphemy. “ The niggardliness o 1
Nature” is a mere euphuism for “the nig-
f ardliness of God.” If we are called upon
o choose between believing that want and
suffering, perpetual and recurrent, are per-
emptorily attributable either to the Injustice
of Man or the Niggardliness of The Al-
mighty, reverence, faith, conviction, nay
reason in spite of reason —compel our choice;
and we choose the unreason in preference 1 o
the blasphemy. It is a blasphemy which,
alas, is familiar as household words. It enters
into the current philosophy of our pro-
fessedly God-loving people. It is essential
to our axioms of "law and order.” It re-
sounds from a thousand pulpits, whence men
are told that poverty is “ ordained.” A
wicked and perverse generation make blas-
phemy a part of their very religion, and
stamp it heresy to affirm that the Injustice
of Man, not “ the Niggardliness of Nature,”
is responsible for the bitter social inequali -
ties. But we have to confess that, although
we reject and spurn the blasphemy, our own
conclusions are in accord with it. How
extricate ourselves from such a dilemma t
There are two chances. Our chain of reason-
ing or our premises must be wrong, one or
the other. The chain of reasoning is our
own. The premises were not ours but
Malthus’. We naturally suspect Malthus,
and would fain challenge his propositions.
But who dare assail a philosophy which has
defied the attacks of Godwin and Benthan,
has received the indorsement of rich and
poor alike, which harmonizes with the
separate system of the giant Darwin, and
has been stamped by the seal of Mill,
Ricardo, Buckle, and a host of other
intellectual Samsons— men candid, disinter-
ested, trained in philosophical analysis.
We are all too weak and puny for such an
enterprize. In truth, we had never venture.!
so far, were it not that a tremendous form
is already battering at the Malthusian
Citadel. Henry George, but yesterday a
journeyman artizan in California, has taken
Malthus by his well-meaning, religious,
honest, but mischievous and blasphemous
throat, and has shaken the life out of his
theory. In “ Progress and Poverty”—a work
which contains a revelation, and, although
yet scarcely known outside America, and
scholarly circles in Europe, seems destined
to shake the world—the Malthusian theory
is frankly grappled, and seemingly smitten
hip and thigh. More than this we will not
venture just now to say. But we throw on t
this hint for reflection. If Malthus and
Mill, and all that school, be wrong, and
blasphemy not truth, and if Henry George
be right, and it be not “the niggardliness of
Nature” which is responsible for want
and suffering, the alternative is that “the
injustice of man” is responsible. What are
you going to do about it ?

Pistols and Toffee.
Gambktta shot by his gyurl, and Gortscuakoff,
that venerable David of 80, poisoned by his
Auishag. Nice old man, Gortschakoff must
have been, to be sure! It’s a topsy-turvoy world.
Gamuetta’s killer has not even been arrested. As
tor Gortsuhakoff’s Brinvilliers, of course
one doesn’t know. They manage these affairs in
so very expeditious arid British-Governmont-in-
Ireland sort of fashion in Russia, that Mrs. Morga-
natic Gortschakoff may be in Heaven, or
Siberia, by now. Of course, tenderness for the
late venerable Prince required that there should
be no csclandre. But when a young person in
humble life takes the liberty of stabbing her
alleged Gortschakoff-Gambktta, why, every-
body agrees that “the —er —lor must take its
course.” Suppose a girl to fix her affections on,
and her knife in, a young man, instead of angling
for a lecherous old bald-pate because he was
powerful and distinguished, and then shooting
him on discovering that Gortschy was, under-
neath the tinsel, a mean, treacherous, little sneak,
with the talents of a police-court attorney and
the principles of a pickpocket, and was stingy
with Ins monov, and objected to the visits of her
<• msin of the Finnish Guard. Conceive that agirl
didn’t sell herself, but fell in love, poor wretch,
with an infernal sweep, as girls are apt to do, and
thinking him an angel of manliness—a girl in love
always fancies her flame an angel, and doesn’t
know that the nimbus which to her eyes surrounds
him is not objective but subjective—lmagined her
honour sate in such celestial keeping ; andwhenshe
found that she had given away her immortal soul
to a devil, under the hallucination that she was
trusting it to an angel of light, she went and
killed the demon. Assuredly it would bo better
that fiends be exorcised by regular legal process.
But who can wonder at such an action on the part
of any girl who knew that her devil had ruined her,
past redemption, in this world, and that no law
woidd adequately punish her destroyer? Some-
times It’s the man who takes the girl for an angel,
and discovers that he has fallen into the arms of a
she-devil, And when this does happen, his case is
almost worse, because he is never believed, and he
Is charged with infamy for merely urging the plea
that the girl, and not he, was in fault. But it
doesn’tjhappon often. 1 Nature makes the male the
pursuer, the female the pursued. Parents and
guardians are too pruriently delicate. They bring
up girls to be simpletons, and then savagely fall
upon them, should they, on being by chance or
necessity loft to look after themselves in Vanity
Fair, barter their treasure for a gross of green
spectacles. Lot girls understand what’s what. Let
them know that very charming fellows, very good
fellows, very high-principled fellows, very
grave and worthy fellows, very reverend
and conscientious fellows, fellows old enough to be
their fathers, fellows old enough to be their grand-
fathers, arc sometimes changed into unscrupulous
swindlers by the mere magic of a maiden’s smile
and glance. * Pretty girls, good girls, innocent girls,
should know that they have the curse of mal-occhia,
of the evil-eye, oven when it beams brightest and
purest, tor some men—and these not a few. Dear
girls, you can’t be too careful. It isn’t the pleasant-a
est fellow vou meet in Vanity Fair who is thol
honestest or the most resolutely unyielding ins
principle. Your honest man is a little apt to be ‘
indifferent about favorably impressing people. And
your man of rigid principles is apt to be somewhat
stilted and unattractive. Do you believe that,
when MoseS Primrose was persuaded to buy that
gross of green spectacles, it was a beetle-browed
ruffian of coarse manners and repellant exterior
who “ strung him on” ? Of course you understand
it was a charming fellow, of most insinuating
address, and with a mellifluous mouth brimming
over with reflections of a chaste morality. Just so
with dear Tom. The more he is charming, the
more you had best defend yourself. You never
know, by a man’s position, antecedents, or reputa-
tion, when the dormant volcano, which most men
have in their bosoms, and which may for half a
life-time smoulder, like the fires of Hecla under an
exterior of ice, may break out.
Civil Servants and Overtime.
Different classes of people will variously regard
the intimation of the Premier, endorsed by the
Treasurer, that “overtime” in the Civil Service is
to be discouraged. Not, of course, that Messrs.
Stuart and Dibbs object to overtime in the sense
of zealous officers burning the midnight oil to
complete urgent work. Nobody objects to that,
and indeed the fact that an officer had habitually
worked overtime might very fairly be advanced
ns a claim for promotion. What is objected to is
over payment. No good business man—Messrs.
Stuart and Dibbs will bear us out —works in
reality updh hard and fast rules. Yet here we
have two very good business men establishing for
the Civil Service such a median law. This is only
apparently anomalous. No good business man
would run such an institution as the Civil Service.
That establishment stands apart, unlike any other
where work has to be done. A business man may
stand the presence in his employment of one or
two relatives. His son and successor, or his
nephew and protege, he may endure, although in a
majority of cases they do not trouble to exert
themselves like an ordinary clerk. Easy as to
their future, and confident of the affection of the
boss their relative, they take it easy, and even it
they have abilities, allow them to rust. But in the
Civil Service the country employs a prodigious
number of sons and nephews of the bosses for the
time being, all more or less satisfied to take things
comfortably, and trust to interest for advance-
ment. When promotion is too slow for their
desires, or salaries do not satisfy their
wants—and when is it otherwise?—a very
agreeable plan is to take it easy during official
hours, write one’s letters and figure up one’s
affairs, doing just enough of a stroke to preserve
appearances, and then, full of devotion and
ardour, to assure “ the chief,” with a brow of care
and an air of exhaustion, that it is impossible to
get through the work in the time, but that you are
(noble self-sacrifice conveyed and understood) pre-
pared to return and labour into the night. By this
means two salaries can very well be earned for one
job. This is an extreme case; but there is little
doubt that, thronged as the Civil Service is with
superfluous hands, and beautiful but easy-going
nephews of everybody, there would be no over-
time were there no underwork. On the other
hand, however, there exist a certain proportion of
Civil Servants who have the misfortune to be —
figuratively speaking—nobody’s son or nephew.
And as there is plenty of work to occupy the time
of half the men in the Service, and it falls upon
that contingent to execute nearly all of what is
done, it may sometimes happen that—a somebody’s
nephew having been granted sick leave for a visit
to Flemington or a run to Tasmania—the unlucky
nephew of nobody, already discharging the work
which two other of the fortunates should be doing,
is called upon to add the labour of the absentee
also to his task. It may be but a straw, yet it
breaks his already burdened back. But Mr. Stuart
is still quite right. The substitute should not be paid
by the Treasury. He should be paid by the absentee.
And, having come to this, we may as well admit
that we don’t see how the plan could be worked.
And, failing a workable discriminative system, the
lesser evil we believe to be—no overtime.
“ Even Clergymen.”
“ Dr. Renwick tells us, and those who have had
experience will not need to be informed, that in
the matter of giving recommendations, even
clergymen cannot be trusted.” So the Herald.
Even clergymen! Anybody but a clergyman would
have written '‘especially clergymen.” It is a
matter of notoriety that no recommendation is so
unreliable as one signed by a clergyman. When
free emigration to Australia was in full swing, and
English parish overseers found it an economical
plan to got rid of the loafers and incapables who
couldn't or wouldn’t work, and the town idiot,
everyone of these worthies was trotted up into
town with a gilt-edgel recommendation by tbq
vector. John Plomer was recommended by\
clergymen as a Public School teacher. The
greatest scoundrels in gaol are the men who are
the chaplains’ pets. The fact is that parsons
don't understand mankind a little bit, and it
is unluckily their little vanity to believe
that that is just what they do understand.
Every scamp knows which is the parson’s
blind side, and sidles up from that direction. It’s
not the clergymen’s fault, of course. The trouble
Is that nothing is so easy to pretend as religious
convictions, and that no matter how sinful a dearly
beloved may have been to the parson’s knowledge,
the unctuously comfortable idea that he has saved
him throws a veil of sacred vanity over the re-
verend dupe’s perceptions. The worse the convert
has been, the greater the triumph of the Gospel
when he is “brought to see the error of his ways,”
and likewise to interlard his language with biblical
expressions. It is more than human nature is
capable of to entertain the suspicion that one
hasn’t accomplished such a splendid cure of souls
after all, or that a man so penitent and so pene-
trated with the right views could be wearing his
tongue in his cheek with wicked ulterior objects
all the time. So the parson, tickled like a trout,
describes in a testimonial, in the best of faith, an
entirely ideal person, that is to say the regenerated
individual, who is often enough simply a weakly
emotional person, with a tine stock of good inten-
tions, and a dangerously shifty susceptibility to the
last influence brought to bear upon him, or else a
slippery scamp without, a vestige of principle or
self-respect, who would profess Mahouunedanism,
or follow the prophet Jok Smith, if he thought he
saw his way to any sort of advantage by doing so.
Mr. Rolleston’s recent presidential address at
the annual meeting of the New South Wales Royal
Society was a dignified, a clear, and an accurate
portrait of that great man (Darwin), whose death
we needn’t now so much regret since we have his
completed work. It would be saying too much to
praise Mr. Christopher Rolleston’s address as
masterly; there was too much attention paid to
Darwin’s visit to these colonies, which was merely
an incident, and is lost by comparison with the re-
sults of his long and patient research. Yet the
address was not unworthy of the occasion, and
deserves praise for its candid and fair treat-
ment of what is still a vexed question. But
even such a meeting could not pass with-
out something vuU-apropps, and this element
was contributed by Mr. Philip Gidley King,
who moved the customary vote of thanks to the
President for his address. This gentleman favoured
the audience with a prelection on his own early
association with the great naturalist. We pass
over what is personal to Mr. Darwin, and there
remain two statements of Mr. King’s opinion
widen set their mark on his address. The first is
that while in Mr. Kino’s company as cabin mate
on the “Beagle” Mr. Darwin was not tainted
with the heterodoxy which ( eheu!) developed in
later years. What a benefit for Mr. King ? How
providentially that estimable person was saved
from the pernicious influence of “ Evolution ”
and “Selection”! The second was the reference
to Mr. Darwin’s funeral. We trust it will be
believed on Mr. King’s authority that two Bishops
of the Anglican Church attended that ceremony.
Who will now venture to deny that the Church is
forgiving and loving-minded? or that the moral
rehabilitation of the poor erring philosopher was
♦ompletej?

A Melbourne husband forgot that in his
wedding vow was contained the injunction, “ and
forsaking all other cleave thee only unto her as
long as ye both shall live," and better esteemed
the delicacies of the carambole and the wit of
billiard-markers. One night returning to his domi-
cile—the hour of the return was not due to his
virtuous resolutions, but to a friendly bint— he
found that his groom had constituted himself a

One day, after being considerably aggra-

horse made a savage snap at him with his teeth.
Turning like a hash, Ingersoll said; “ In the devil’s

noon, and the captious judge had a hard time
among the lawyers for the rest of the day.
Rev. Talmage declares that the name of
the raven that visited Edgar Allen Poe was D.T.,
“ only that, and nothing more.” Not unlikely; and
rather smart of Talmage. But what about the
“ lost Len ore ?” “ Bare and radiant maidens ” are
not generally associated with blue devils, pink
bulldogs with eyes like Waverley tram-lights, and
visions of that kind. The visions are hardly so
pleasant. Stay I though. Bad as the D.T. visions
might be, they can’t be much worse than a nauseous
dose of De W.T.
The consumption of lager beer is every

executing orders for every town in Australia.
Homebush is destined to be the great

magnificent. Near the historic racecourse, and
within three minutes of the railway station, one of
largest hotels in N. 8. W. is in course of erection—
Sturt’s Wentworth Hotel. The cost is about
£25,000; 120 rooms, with spacious balconies, court-
yards, &c.
“Give Me Time.”
Did you hear, reader, of the eviction of Mary
Master ? Well, it occurred in London, and it’s a
very short story. She died from cold and famine
in that great city of gold. She couldn't pay her
rent, and was very ill. In the bitter depth of an
English winter, her landlord took the furniture;
on the iJOth December he took the window and
door away. If a man wants the sleet and snow
and hail to beat into his own house, of course he
has a legal right to let them; but still the perverse
widow didn’t pay. On the last day of 1882, the
parish officer found Mary Baster in a faint, with
blue-cold limbs, and wasted frame, with hair
clotted with mud, propped up against the frost-
beaded wall—ill, stain ed, dying. But he found her
too late, and Mary Baster spent her New Year
where there are no landlords, and no rent is asked.
She had promised to pay, and had pleaded: “Give
me time—”
’Mid the wealth of a city away in the West,
Where pity is cold as the dune.
In a windowless room, sits a widow, oppressed
With the nightmare of want, and the pain of un-
rest,
Whose weak voice beseeches for “Time!”
With the clots of the mud of the street in her hair,
Propped up by the wall all agrime
With the marks of long struggle, she bends to
despair,
For the grip of the law of the landlord is there,
That murders her—yet for no crime.
Of the relics she strove to retain, none is left,
The broker has had her last dime;
By wrong, dressed in legal attire, she’s bereft,
Starved dead by the law: not for fraud or for
theft,
But merely for wanting of time.
The landlord by law is upheld in his deed;
Yet! Christ would accuse him of crime
Who presses the pauper to death in his need—
Who ne’er to the cry of the orphan gives heed—
Or the plea of the widow for “Time.”

THE SCIENCE OF KISSING.
“ Nyum-Nyum.”— Shakespeare
PEOPLE will kiss,
yet not one in a hun-
dred knows how to
extract bliss from
lovely lips, any more
than he knows how lo
make diamonds from charcoal.
First know whom you are going
to kiss. Don’t make a mistake,
although a mistake may
bo good. Don’t jump like
a trout for a fly, and smack a
good woman on the neck, on the
ear, on the corner of her fore-
head, or on the end of her
nose, or knock off her lace
fall. The gentleman should
be a little the taller. Flo should have a clean face,
a kind eye, and a mouth full of expression. Don’t
kiss everybody. Don’t sit down to it; stand up.
Need not be anxious about getting in a crowd.
Two persons are plenty to corner, and catch a
kiss ; more persons would spoil the sport. Take
the left hand of the lady in your right ; let your
your hat go to—any place out of the way ; pi ice
the left hand gently over the shoulder of the adv t
and let it fall down the right side, towards the belt.
Don’t be in a hurry ; draw her gently, lovingly, to
your heart. Her head will fall lightly upon your
shoulder,—and a handsome shoulder-strap it
makes. Don’t be in a hurry : send a little life
down your left arm. Her left hand is in your
right; let there be an impression to that, not like
the grip of a vyce, but a gentle clasp full of electri-
city, thought, and respect. Don’t be in a hurry.
Her head*lies carelessly on your shoulder. You are
nearly heart to heart. Look down into her half-
closed eyes. Gently, yet manfully press her to
your bosom. Stand firm. Be brave, but don’t be
In a hurry. Her lips are almost open. Lean
slightly forward with your head, not the body.
Take good aim ; the lips moot, the eyes close ; the
heart opens ; the soul rides the storms, Houbles,
and sorrows of life (don’t be in a hurry); heaven
opens before you ; the world shoots under your
feet, as a meteor flashes across the evening sky
(don’t be afraid); the nerves dance before the j ust
erected altar of love, as zephyrs dance with the
dew-trimmed flowers ; the heart forgets its bitter-
ness, and the art of kissing is learned. No fuss, no
noise, no fluttering. It don’t require a brass band
to make it legal.
Kissing is one of the easiest things in the
world to do, when there’s no one looking, except
you and her. And, if you notice, she generally shuts
her eyes. When, however, there are several hun*
dreds of people looking on at the interesting opera-
tion, it’s a different matter; and a difficult
matter, too, to accomplish with just the* proper
amount of earnestness and grace required. The
general youth, who thinks himself rather good at
this sort of thing in private life, will no doubt be
surprised to hear that it’s one of the most artful
acts on the stage to do correctly. And if the
amateur doesn’t take care, he’ll find his feet trip-
ping in a silk train, his coat sleeve caught in some
delicate floating lace, the lappel smudged with
white powder, and very likely he and his healthy
but heavy girl will stagger in a most undignified
manner, because she doesn’t know how to hold him
rightly, and he steps out with the wrong foot.
The art of love-making and its contingent kissing
have been most carefully studied by leading
actresses, and they all have their own peculiar
method of osculation. Pretty Miss Neilson used
t
8 o hang around Romeo’s neck as if she loved the
mell of starched shirt-front, and with an ecstatic
abandon that was very gratifying to him. And
when the kiss was put on, it stayed a long time.
Sara Jewett is said to bestow a kiss as soft as vel-
vet, and has become noted for the grace with
which she can pose within a pair of manly arms.
Lotta just pecks at a fellow’s face, and is liable to
Strike anywhere between the eyes and the chin.
There is a jump, a smack, and that’s all. It’s the
Wf ! rs i kind of a kiss, because it can’t be antici-
pated, and the actor only realizes what it is when
it s all over.
Mrs. Langtry doesn’t impress one with the
idea that she cares about being kissed, as she only
allows the leading man to touch her lips respect-
fuUy, and doesn’t lie at all nicely in his arms.
Langtry’s kisses aren’t by any means commen-
surate with her fame. And it isn’t every man who
could do her justice, either ; for if he does not
make his lips pretty extensive, he’ll most likely
And he has left, about a quarter of her rosebud
mouth unkissed after all. Miss Mary Anderson is
rather difficult to kiss nicely, because she is too
tall to nestle down upon a manly broad chest. She
kisses in a good, straightforward way, however, as
though she isn’t ashamed of it.
That old Australian favorite, Catherine Lewis,
whose sprightly ways in opera bouffe win for her
hosts of male admirers in every city she visits, has
evidently given a great deal of thought to the art.
She wraps her arms about the neck of her mock
lover as if she wanted to make them go twice
around, and when she is sure of her grip she opens
her lips freely and glues them on the right spot,
according to the laws of suction. All is still for a
tew seconds ; then there is a loud pop, and the
operation is over. Her sister, Jeffreys-Lewis, is
more subdued, yet extremely luxurious. She likes
her lover to sit in a chair. She walks cautiously
around him first, as though she was watching a
place to light on. With a whirl she falls on her
knees and bends backward over his right knee,
tossing her arms about his neck and drawing ins
face close to hers, For a moment she looks into
his eyes, and then proceeds to business. The kiss
jS long, quiet, and dreamy, and means whole
volumes. Modjeska kisses in an intellectual
fashion. She prefers to be kissed rather than to
kiss, and her graceful movements make her an
easy person to act with. There is no unnecessary
clutching and clawing to hold on to her lover
She rests upon his bosom in a picturesque way
that is very pleasing to the eye.

A pawnbroker has discovered that ninety-
nine per cent, of the money he lends is spent on
strong drink. Hence it is that a pawnbroker ad-
vances so little money on a pawned article and
charges so much for the accommodation. It is all
in the interest of temperance.
The Western Champion (Blackall) was so
interested in chronicling the gift of what it terms
“a monstrous spud,” that it forgot, for a while,
all about the education question. But we shall

system are such as, to an Impartial mind,” etc. We

A child has been born in America whose
body is not so long as the forearm of an ordinary
person, and whoso weight at birth was but one and
a half pounds. The child’s body is but eleven inches
long, and nowhere is the circumference more than
six inches. Its hand is not so large as a penny,
its head is no larger than a piece of chalk or
a walnut, its arms look like a man’s little
finger when it has not much nail on it, and the
child’s leg looks like a man’s centre linger when it
has no wart. It is a perfectly-formed child, its
physical organization being faultless even to its
hair.
Everyone has observed the helplessness of
a woman when a ’bus is going by, and the boy finds
it convenient not to see her. She can’t whi tie, and
fails at a shout. She can scream like fun; but the
only time it would be any earthly use to her, she
won’t do it. Finally, when the ’bus has got beyond
the range of any living voice, she grabs the nearest
male—sure to be a shy young man, with a rod face
—and, without ever having an introduction to him,
coolly says: “Oh, please tell that ’bus to stop.”
We’ve known young men suddenly trapped this
way die on the spot. But what we introduced the
subject for was merely to say that somebody has
invented a small shrill silver whistle for ladies to
carry as a trinket. Bless him!
Here is the ironclad vow taken by the
members of a Young Women’s Anti-Tobacco As-
sociation “I, Jane Jenkins (or whatever the
name may be), solemnly pledge my sacred honour
that I will never again kiss any young man, his
father, brother, uncle or cousin, who chews,
smokes or snuffs, or carries any cigarettes. I
further declare that I will not allow any such
person to sit up with me in the night time,
either in parlour, summer-house, or any other
place ; neither will I ride out at night in a covered
carriage or buggy, with any such cigarette
smoker; but if by accident or over-persuasion I
should be induced to do so, I pledge my word as a
loving-hearted girl that I will sit on the opposite
side of the conveyance and keep my head turned
to the exterior. And should he venture to put
his arm around my neck or waist, drawing me to-
ward him, and attempt to kiss, or hug me, I pledge
my word that I will treat him as coldly as my
defenceless condition will allow. All of which I
solemnly promise and declare without equivoca-
tion or mental reservation.”
Perhaps the queerest model for imitation
ever proposed to young ladies was the one selected
tor their emulation by Mr. Laishley, Chairman of
the Board of Education, at a distribution of cer till-
cates of merit to the students at the Girls’ High
School, Auckland (N.Z.) When Mark Twain
delivered his celebrated after-dinner reply to the
toast of “the Ladies,” he dwelt upon the shining
example furnished by, among others, Lucrezia
Borgia. But Mark was funning, whereas Mr.
Laishley was in solemn earnest when he counselled
the Auckland girls to follow in the steps of
—Madame de Pompadour! The style in which
Mr. Laishley urged the example of Pompa-
dour upon the High School girls was as
funny as his choice of her as a model. He said:
“Think for this purpose of that lady of France,
ugly and poor, whom Louis XIV. detested, but
who was determined that he should marry her.
She was clever and resolute, gifted with that spirit
of perseverance, that lixity of purpose, which,
whether its object be the training of a poodle or
the subjugation of a hero, is sure to succeed atlast,
so she waited and watched; and ex necessitate he
had to marry her. But make haste slowly. And
now, young ladies, to mark the occasion, I give you
a half-holiday.” The girls must have needed the
half-holiday to laugh in, and to collect their
dishevelled ideas. It must have taken their breath
away to And themselves advised to be clever and
resolute, to cultivate a fixity of purpose, and apply
it to the subjugation of a hero by waiting and
watching, and so arranging matters that the hero
finds himself bound to marry them from the
necessities of the case! This exemplar of what an
Auckland young lady should be, was a handsome
penniless girl, who first married an old man for his
money and position. As his wife she entered the
great world and attended court, and then deliber-
ately threw herself at the head of King
Louis XV., whose mistress she became. She
was never married to him. Louis was an-
other meagre little wretch, crammed with
vanity, a “ hero ” who never joined his own armies
without trundling his own retinue of princesses
and mistresses at his heels, and then only when he
had received positive assurances that his Marshal
had fixed up a beleagured city or an enemy inferior
in force, so that he had only to come and see the
victory gained. Pompadour went to live with
Louis, and soon achieved such an ascendancy over
him that she made the old boy get rid of his other
ladies, till she bega/n to get faded, and then she
x-eclaimed hop influence by introducing other
young ladies—from a Girl’s High School per-
haps —to the Monarch. When Mr. Laishley
next wants to pick out a paragon for the Auckland
girls to imitate, he might as well try Cleopatra or
Mrs. Langtry. Cleopatra subjugated a lot of
heroes, while Mrs. Langtry “Yes, dear; hold
the baby ? Certainly.”

Some women recently got up an anti-
smoking society. The question upon which they
divided was whether it would be better to refuse
to kiss all the young men who soiled their lips
with tobacco, or to agree to kiss all those who did
it Nothing so strongly tests a man’s veracity as
to be summoned to the door to be confronted
with the question—“ Arc you the head of the
house ?” Mrs. Smith, triumphantly: “ The hand
that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the
world.” Mr. Smith, cynically: “Yes, indeed, my
dear; and that’s just why the world is so deuccdly
badly governed.” The “ last words” of men are
often printed—the last words of women never
When the practical Mrs. Smith was told of a won-
derful instance of prayer-cure, she remarked:
“ Only think of it! It didn’t cost a single penny,
did it?” No furniture can give such finish to a
room as a tender woman’s face. And yet when a
woman wants a new drawing-room suite that
argument won’t avail you a copper... The rule of

A gentleman who recently received a piece of
wedding-cake, placed it under his pillow, and all

with the sickening sensation that he was already
married and had seven hungry yowling children to

Under the new English Married Women’s Propei ty
Act, a woman is liable to be arx-csted for theft if

jewels and wearing apparel valued at £l2. Hex-

prosecuted his wife as a thief. The court decided
against the defendant, who was beautiful us well
as wayward.

Edward Bottrell, an advertising “ diseuse-
curer” who is possessed of far more impudence
than diploma, and who some time ago managed to

for having assisted in the distribution of an ob-
scene book, entitled “Such Things Exist,” and in-
formed that if he again came before the court he
would be sent to gaol. Hottrell, who was some
years ago lined in Melbourne for practising with-
out proper qualification, has made plenty of
money in Sydney, where scores of credulous hypo-
chondriacs flock to his shrine.
Leprosy is, it has been settled beyond
doubt, communicable to whites. At the Hawaii
leper settlement, there are ten white lepers out of
a total of eight hundred cases. Two children of
foreign parentage are also reported as having con-
tracted leprosy through vaccination with virus
taken from the arm of a native. One of these
children died at Honolulu within a short time
after being vaccinated. Forty-eight lepers arrived
at Honolulu per Lohna from Maul, on the 10th
March. Was over anything more horrible than a
leper settlement ?” There are over 1(300 lepers at
large in the islands, and the annual crop of new
cases is from 200 to 250, or one person infected
annually by every six lepers.
Another river—named after the discoverer,
Mr. 'T. A. Hizant—has been found in North Queens-
hind, 150 miles from Cooktown, in the neighbour-
hood of Princess Charlotte’s Bay. It runs nearly
north and south, and is navigable for over 20 miles
from 100 to 200 yards wide, with a depth of 14 ft. of
water at halt-tide on the bar. There are no dlffl-
culties in entering* the river. The country near
the coast is low and swampy for about ton miles
from the sea, but after that, on the eastern side,
there are fine open plains with but very few trees
and plenty of water; on the west side there are
more lulls, as also on the southern; but on both
sides there are largo and navigable creeks. Soil
and climate good; very few blacks; plenty of fish.
At Charters Towers (Q.) Robert Brown Nes-
bitt, a drunken miner, called at a couple of hum-
pies at two o’clock on Sunday morning, and asked
the inmates to have some schnapps. Next moru-
mg ho was found dead, stiff and cold, outside one
of the humpies,, with a bullet-wound through his
temple. The police theory is that he was shot when
standing, and fell against some hard substance
which cut his hat. Others think he was shot
whilst lying in a drunken sleep, and that the re-
volver was put close to his temple, which bore the
marks of powder. The occupiers of the humpies
(Pratt and Middeton, unmarried, and Simpson, a
married man) have been arrested on suspicion. A
Colt’s six-chamber revolver was found in Pratt’s
trunk, one barrel recently discharged, the other
five being unloaded. The affair is shrouded in mys-
tery, and no motive for the crime has, so far, been
suggested.
Mr. Justice Wiudeyer, the Draco of the
N.SW. bench, has his hands full just now, for ho
must naturally be interested in maintaining the
justice of the sentences he imposes. Some time
ago M'Mahon, then Mayor of Petersham, a man of
wealth, and theretofore of good repute, was con-
victed of uttering a forged £lOOO bill, purporting
to bear the signature of one Andreas, who was
dead before ArMahou traded off the promissory
note. The Judge sent prisoner to gaol for seven
or eight years, remarking that he had been found
guilty of the hideous crime of robbing a dead
Sfts~T°r rather of robbing his widow and children.
M Mahon has plenty of money (the Crown does not,
in these days, exercise its power of confiscating the
estates of convicted felons), and his money
buys friends who are trying hard to ob-
tain his release. Last week, again, Thomas
Cosgrove, a Gortschakotf of sixty, was convicted
of murder. He had “ taken up ” with a fifty-year
old charmer named Wagner, and had entrusted her
with £l5O, all the money he had in the world. She
left him to live with another man, and refused to
return his little hoard. He went to her one night
and asked her to kiss him. She turned to do so,
whereupon he shot her mortally. Judge Wiudeyer
sentenced him to death, and told him there wasn’t
asmgie mitigating circumstance” in his case.
We think a Irench Jury would hold this to bo
murder in the second degree. Cosgrove, if sent to
gaol, will probably die before ten years ; a life-
long sentence means for an old man like him sen-
tence of death. The Judge has sent to gaol, for
eight years the previously “ respectable ”
cur who cut the throat of a racehorse •
and he prescribed fifteen years’ gaol for the oft-
convicted scoundrel who atempted robbery under
arms at Colyton, and who, after knocking down
young Mr. Andrews with the butt of a pistol, was
beaten off by the fine plucky 81-year-old father of
the fallen man. No exception is taken to the two
last named sentences; but it seems possible that
Bechet, the French merchant who got seven years
for arson, with a view to pocketing his insurance,
will sooner or later have his case “ favourably con-
sidered.” Bechet himself didn’t anticipate con-
viction—in fact he was so sure of acquittal that, on
the night before the trial, ho ordered an elaborate
supper to be ready for him and the friends who
wore to celebrate his happy escape. But Nemesis
came between the cup and the Up.

tentatlous” (to put it mildly) in his personal ap-
pearance, that on one occasion a resident droppen a
shilling: into his hand by way of charity. The
Journal states that much curiosity exists as to
what particular church Costley belonged, and how
it was that no parson or priest got hold ot hnn be-
fore his exit from this vale of tears. Another
paper alludes to the deceased as “ a striking in-
stance of the superiority of religious morality over
religious creed.
From Melbourne Punch :
“ IN MEMORIAM.
SIR JOHN O’SHAN ASSY.
Ob. May sth, 1883.
“ A holier Crusader never knelt
To take from Rome a leader s sacred trust—
We, who believed him wrong, still ever felt
That he himself believed his cause was just.
Where can his Church on such another call?
* He was the noblest Roman of them all.
The Langtrys are again before the public
by the fact that Miss Agnes Langtry, sister of the
Lily’s husband, sent from England to chaperone
her through the United States when Mrs. Labpu-
chere gave up the task, eloped on March 31st witn
a Toronto young man named Stone, and was mar-
ried at the Church ot All Saints, at Drummond-
ville, Toronto. The Lily, once more desolate, is
very angry with her sister, and shocked at what
she calls her want of propriety ; but the tact is the
latter was sensible in not missing the opportunity
to get a good husband.
The Evening News dilates upon the no vcity
of an actor, while under arrest, playing for a night
at the Princess Theatre. Dunedin (N.Z.), and ot a
young Mexican tumbler, while undergoing a
month’s seclusion for being drunk and dyspeptic,
being escorted by a file of soldiers nightly froni his
cell to the circus to perform acrobatic duties.
These cases have colonial precedents. Years ago,
when Captain ruled the Jurisprudential roast
at Sydney, big Jack Dargon, a military prisoner,
was allowed out of the custody of the Provost one
day to fight Abe Davis tor the diversion of the
officers and their friends. Abe won the day, but
Dargon had portion of his sentence remitted tor
the stoicism with which he sustained his brutal
“ bashing.”
All speakers are not quite so wide-awake
as Speaker Barton. In a certain colony a knightly
speaker is of a rather somnolent disposition. Ho
had lately returned from a visit to Albion, and had
been considerably “champagned ” by the mem-
bers. Shortly after the House resumed in the
middle of a somewhat excitable debate, an omi-
nous snore from the Speaker’s throne sent a thrill
of silence through the Legislative Hall. The clerk
of the House, seeing the state of affairs, gave the
dozy chief a few respectful nudges. He, waking
up in a half stupor, but with most resonant voice,
cried: “ The question now before the House is that
this House do now adjourn; those who are ot that
opinion will say ‘aye,’ on the contrary ‘no, and
the ‘ayes’ have it I’'’ And the amazed House did
adjourn, though some people believe the “mouth
had more to do with that perfunctory adjournment
than the “ ayes.”
When referring to the late Czar, it has been
the invariable habit of most Journals to refer to
him as a sort of saint and martyred Liberal, whose
shining virtue was the emancipation of the serfs,
an act of spontaneous beneficence, indicative
of the humanity of his disposition. On the other
hand, a correspondent of the Pale Male Gazette,
writing from Russia, says the revolutionists “knew,
what we all know, that the great reform of 1861,
the emancipation of the serfs, was no act of
Imperial beneficence, but was extorted by the
dread of a general insurrection.” The martyred
Czar’s reputation as a saint hurriedly manufactured
for a special occasion, isn’t wearing well. Getting
frayed already. We shouldn’t wonder, if after a
tew more years, the reputation of “ the monster
Arabl” smelt sweeter than that of “the Father of
his People.”
“Bob” Lowe,now Lord Sherbrooke, was a
pretty active writer for the colonial press while
residing in Sydney. His method of composition
was unique. He would throw himself on a couch,
and with his face to the wall deliver a hot and
vigorous speech, from which dictation the article
would be penned by a smart writer. The youngster
usually employed for this work was a son of an
eminent murderer, who was one of the last con-
victs executed publicly in Sydney. The gentleman
in question, who was very highly connected Indeed,
murdered an old woman for the sake of a few
shillings. Mr. Lowe unsuccessfully defended him
in court, and after he had fallen down and broken
his neck, the now eminent statesman took care of
his children.
Mark Twain likes champagne to loosen
his tongue when he has to talk, but says it clogs
the brain for lengthened literary labour. Oliver
Wendell Holmes prefers his brain unclouded by
any stimulant whatever, when writing. But he
admits that mental action is quickened by spiritu-
ous liquors, and even that bright ideas reaching
the brain under their influence may remain.
Matthew Arnold drinks claret, and works well on
it. Professor Blackie takes wine for appetite, but
never for work. Wilkie Collins says lie is nerved
and composed by using tobacco. Edison becomes
violently excited by drink, but gets Inspiration by
chewing tobacco. Gladstone regards a little wine
as necessary to him at the time of his great in-
tellectual exertions. Sir John Robertson confines
himself to peppermint. The Bulletin men all
take ginger beer and raspberry, but only in moder-
ate quantities.
Poor Bowie Wilson went out of politics a
few years ago like a corpulent squib bursting up
at both ends. He was one of the party who was
everywhere met with the saying, “Yes, Sir James”
—on account of their servility to “ Jimmy Martin,”
the then head of the Government. Bowie con-
tested East Sydney. When he came forward at
the hustings, “to give an account of his steward-
ship,” 4000 people said they didn’t want to hear it.
And they howled to that effect. It was one shriek,
whereupon Bowie remarked that if they wouldn’t
hear him, the country would. He then turned
round, and—horror of horrors!—delivered a solid
hour’s oration to the reporters. It was bad enough
to hear Bowie’s voice diluted with the laughter
and growls of 4000 people, but to have it delivered
neat, with trurapet-tongued harshness, right at
one’s ear, was Indeed a torment. Bowie, of course,
was thrown out ,or rather was blown up, with his
whole party. In a word, they gave up law-making
for law-breaking.
In March last, the remains of John How ard
Payne were conveyed to New York, amid consider-
able popular feeling. He has been spoken of as
the wandering American who wrote a few lines of
doggerel to a plaintive scrap of Italian melody,
and then woke to find himself famous. The coffin,
draped with the national colours, was carried in
procession; while through the streets from a crack
city band the strains of “Home, sweet home,” from
the long-forgotten drama of “ Clari,” fell on the
ear; followed by “Nearer, my God, to Thee,” “The
lost chord,” the “ Old Hundredth,*’ and the “ Star-
spangled Banner,” An American writer thus dis-
solves some of the sentiment about the author of
the most sentimental ballad:—“ There has been
much said about the country’s ingratitude to
Payne. The country gave him a consulate—it has
done no more for Bret Harte. It built him a
monument—which it is trying to do for Washington
and Garfield. It immortalised him for writing
eight lines of slopwork verse for the libretto of a
tlirasy opera.”
Of all the Queen’s sons, the Prince of Wales
certainly comes in for most gossip. Yet there’s
one thing to be said in favour of Albert Edward;
he never forgets he’s a Prince—in public. He will
with Langtry, Cornwallis-West, Chamber-
lain, the shadowy Sarah, or the sprightly Nellie
Barren ; but he keeps dignified, resents familiarity,
and even In his easiest moments of dalliance is
always princely. The Duke of Edinburgh is a
cold, calculating, close-fisted man, with neither
many friends nor many enemies. Hens almost
miserly in his fondness for money. T.he Duke of
Cornwall is a popularity-hunter, who makes a
point of taking much interested notice ot .other
people’s children, and there is nothing m which he
appears to take greater delight than getting a chair
for an old lady, or handing round the cake at an
afternoon tea. The Duke of Albany is goody-goody;
has never been known to do anything particularly
good or particularly bad. He has £20,000 a year, a
German wife, and a peculiarly thin skin.
Dick Baker is a member for the Wimmera,
Vie., and recently, whilst inspecting a mine, fell
down a shoot and broke his leg. Believing he has
still a leg to stand upon, he is asking the company
tor £250 compensation. Dick has been a good
many things. For years he hungered for Parlia-
mertt. He therefore spouted temperance, patro-
nised piety, and sold herbs to the poor in
Armstrong-street, Ballarat. He came very near
getting in once or twice; but, finally, finding the
Vales and Finchams and Brophys had pegged out
the electorates in and around Ballarat, he packed
up his few handfuls of dried turnip-tops and
started up the Wimmera country lite-insuring.
He can insinuate himself into any society in the
capacity ot an agent, and can be persuaded to
leave. If he didn’t get a proposal, he came near
getting a vote. He got to know the wants of
every class in the vast district of the Wimmera,
stood, and was again beaten by a narrow majority.
The last election he played his old tune on the
“Education Act in danger,” and turned out the
O’Callaghan. And now his leg is, we hope, mend-
ing. We mention him to recall a little thing said
whilst we were residing in Donald. A storekeeper
named Meyers, who was a very old resident, got
into difficulties. The heart of the astute Dick
bled, and from house to house and farm to farm
he carried the sympathetic tale of the downfall of
so old a resident. Dick had never been in Donald
before, but Dick’s heart wanted to bleed, and bleed
it did. Round went the hat, and in a week or two
his crushed soul had the satisfaction of handing
over, amidst thunders of applause from himself, a
stiff sum to the struggling tradesman. Dicks
name was down for a tidy sum at the top ot the
list—just to start the thing. He had got numerous
life proposals, ho had got the character of a good,
kind-hearted man amongst voters’ wives, and now
he got back the little initiatory dole that set the
ball a-rolling.
The Coronation of Kalakana.
Thebe was more excitement in the Sand-
wich Islands over the coronation of Kalakaua than
has been known since that little matter of Captain
Cook’s. For weeks past the palace servants were
busy capturing stray missionaries, and fattening
them; and as these form the chief item in the
menu of £lite society there, as much as ten cocoa-
nuts and a collar button were known to be paid
for a good flabby missionary of the Hardshell
breed. The King’s costumiers had been engaged
in most elaborate toilets of glass beads and shells ;
and gifts from kind Sunday-school children, sent
out through the Society for Spreading the Gospel
and Supplying Silk Polonaises to the Females of
Desert Islands, were gratefully received. At noon
the King was sufficiently sober to be brought out
with much pomp, and the appearance of the pro-
cession as it moved off was hailed with delight and
decayed fruit. All the residents wore their best
costumes, and, as the weather was warm, they
mostly wore them on poles. First came the Prime
Minister and Cabinet in full undress, consisting of
paint and sharks’ teeth ; then the fattened mis-
sionaries ; and, lastly, His Majesty’s wives, whose
dresses were most tastefully abbreviated, and very
airy. It is Impossible to describe them all, but we
may say that No. 37, who was decidedly the belle,
presented an elegant ensemble in blucher boots, a
scarlet garibaldi stylishly looped up on one side and
cut away on the other, a.nd chevelure arranged with
cocoanut oil and junks of coral. The King wore a
pretty bonnet. Immediately after the procession,
the King was crowned amid the blare of tom-toms,
and the fattened missionaries won their martyrs’
crowns, and were served up by His Majesty’s chef
as follows
Baptist Missionary soup and onions.
Roast Methodist, with Episcopal gravy,
Presbyterian, stuffed with garlic,
Female Missionary minced.
The ceremony being concluded. King Kalakaua
picked his teeth with a hairpin, and his loyal
subjects went back to their usual occupations of
clubbing one another, and studying the knotty
problem of how the mischief the milk gets into the
cocoanut.
E. Russell Daunt, the pious gentleman who
left Sydney under circumstances very distressing
to those who had been so foolish as to trust him,
and who is charged with several larcenies as a
bailee, has, for pretty well-understood reasons,
returned to Sydney, and given himself up to the
officers of the law —though, according to some of
the daily papers, a detective “ received informa-
tion” and made “a smart capture.” It is to be
hoped that strict inquiry will be made into the
circumstances under which Daunt originally
effected his escape, and the alleged connection
therewith of a certain city man. It is asserted
that Daunt went on board ship dressed as a woman,
and that, with the assistance of a friend who
was very deeply interested in his departure, he
“ made himself up ” at a well-known temple of
Venus. All this reminds us that a young gentle-
man, who some months ago suddenly departed from
Sydney, leaving in deep mourning several shent
pershenters” and others who had advanced large
sums in view of his coming of age at an early date,
has surprised one or two creditors by forwarding
them drafts from England for the amount of his
Indebtedness.
The city of Sandhurst is the only one in
the British dominions where a professional book-
maker has a seat at the Town Council, with an off-
chance of becoming 1 Mayor, and a seat at the Hos-
pital Board, with a fair show of becoming President.
Nor is this all. Whenever a general election ap-
proaches, or a Parliamentary vacancy occurs,
numbers of enlightened citizens are to be found
imploring the “metallician” to “stand.” Oddly
enough, the person who receives this unquestion-
ing submission and support cannot speak half a
dozen sentences, or write half a dozen lines, with-
out leaving adverbs and adjectives, negatives and
affirmatives, singulars and plurals, as mixed as the
Yankee infantry after the first volley at Bull’s Bun.
Men of every calling, from a pugilist to a doll’s eye
polisher, have been sent to make laws before now.
The names of the hod-men, chimney-sweeps, and
persons following more malodorous callings to be
found among Cromwell’s most uncompromising-
supporters, and among the saiis-culotte s of ninety
years ago, are bewildering. But to Bendigo alone
has been reserved the honour of standing up for
Jack Falstatf, with none of the humour by which
Jack has kept the world simmering for the last two
or three hundred years.
Here is the portion of Mr. Rusdeu’s
“HistoiT of New Zealand” of which Mr. Bryce
the N.Z. Native Minister, complained in his
speech, and in respect to which he jhas intimated
his intention of proceeding against Mr. Rusden
for libel:— “Lieutenant
Bryce, who was in after years Native Minister, dis-
tinguished himself. Some women and young
children emerged from a pah to hunt pigs. Lieu-
tenant Bryce and Sergeant Maxwell ot the Kai
Iwi Cavalry, dashed upon them, and cut them down
gleefully and with ease. This exploit will be
looked tor in vain in Mr. Gudgeon’s book, which
records a rash and unfortunate affair in which,
subsequently (December 28th), Sergeant Maxwell,
riding up to Titokowaru’s pah, Tauranga-ike, was
shot. But the treatment of the children was not
unknown. Dr. Featherston, the Superintendent
of the Province of Wellington, expressed his
horror ; Rangihiwinui declared that he would not
have joined the local forces it he had thought
them capable of such acts. He earned thereby
the hatred of Bryce, who, long afterwards, when
Native Minister, dismissed Kangihiwinui from
office. Bryce earned among the Maoris a title
which will, cling to him. They called him kohuru,
the murderer.” As already stated, Mr. Bryce pro-
nounces all this to be an infamous lie.
A most sensational divorce case, mysteri-
ous hints concerning the horror ot which have
appeared in telegrams to our daily papers, has just
been decided in the Adelaide Supreme Court, the
cause cHebre being that ot Morier v. Morier. There
were two co-respondents named in the petition,
which was at the suit ot Dr. Morier, a gentleman
well-known in South Australia. One was a groom
who had been in the petitioner’s employ; the other
was the notorious Dr. Horton, who iigured so pro-
minently in the life-assurance conspiracy cases, ,
and who is at present “ putting in his time in that
rural retreat, the Yatala Labour Prison, tor his
misdeeds in connection therewith. Mrs. Morier is
a lady who possesses an income of her own, is rather
good-looking, and comes from a first-rate family in
Scotland. Ever since she was “ fixed ” for life to
the doctor, she has evinced a morbid desire for the
love ot the other sex, and it appears that this
“love,” in more instances than one, assumed a
practical form. Mrs. Morier, it was adduced, was
addicted to drink, and, when under the influence
ot liquor, acted in a manner altogether too shock-
ing to particularise—so shocking that it cannot
even be hinted at. The manner in which she gave
her evidence in court showed that she literally
revelled in her wanton amusements; and there is
no knowing how tar she might have gone if the
Judge had not cut her short in her disgusting
narrative in reference to a question of condona-
tlon. The counsel for the doctor considered that
they had no necessity for proceeding with the case
in which Skelton was co-respondent, and accord-
ingly struck him out of the record, the evidence in
regard to Horton being all that was wanted. His
Honor Judge Boucaut, who conducted the case,
said he would report the adultery proved to the
Full Court. The first day of the trial the public
and the Press were excluded, but scathing leaders
in the daily journals (the holy “bosses” of
them no doubt yearning for particulars) the next
morning had the effect of making his Honor alter
his determination. The case is undoubtedly the
most filthy that has ever occurred in South Aus-
tralia, and it can hardly be conceived that a woman
with the birth and education of the respondent
could perform acts to equal which we should have
to plunge into the dregs of the Satyrlcon of
Petronius.
Sir Bryan O’Loghlen, ex-Premier of Vic-
toria, is, so saith rumour, in pecuniary difficulties.
After forming his Government he speculated in
mining shares, and was hit very hai’d indeed. Tom
Bent, his Minister for Railways, is still faithful,
and has started a subscription to put him straight;''
but the stated object is to “ recognize his ability as
a statesman, his gentlemanly mien, and his services
to the country.” When he was first introduced to
politics he was elected for North Melbourne as a
supporter of Sir James M'Culloch. Afterwards he
was rejected, and as a consolation he was appointed
Crown Prosecutor, the only position he was ever
successful in. On the death of his brother, Sir
Coleman of that ilk, he came into the baronetcy and
family estates (the latter mortgaged to the hilt),
and was returned to the Imperial Parliament by
his brother’s constituents as member tor Clare.
This is where his nobility steps in. He “ sacrificed”
his (mortgaged) estates, his seat in the Commons,
and his Crown Prosecutorship (at £BOO a year), first
for a Land-Tax Commissionership at £lOOO, and
then for the Attorney-Generalship at £l7OO per
annum, the ultimate object of his ambition being
a Judgeship at £3OOO, which dodged him in a most
provoking manner. While Berry and Pearson
were home as an Embassy, Sir Bryan was Chief
Secretary, and made some huge mistakes. However,
he is not a bad fellow, socially, can sing and play
well, and is loyal to himself and to Dunvllle. The
subscriptions now total £l6OO, but they want £6OOO,
and don’t they wish they may get it 1
A Ballarat citizen has once more discovered
the secret of perpetual motion. He is keeping it
dark for the present, until he obtains patent rights
over the other continents. • But it is not easy to
keep a matter like this quiet. A good many useful
things have been found out up Ballarat way. For
dummying land or salting a mine there are men
there who need not be ashamed to take the chair at
any meeting, or accept the “billy” in any company.
Hundreds of old Ballarat men can take you to
where three-ounce-to-the-tub stuff was left by the
early diggers (“they didn’t know how to save the
gold then”) and hasn’t been touched since. Even
in Sandhurst, where children do not cut their eye-
teeth nearly so soon, there are numbers of antique
diggermen who for an insignificant pour-boire will
show you where nineteen-pennyweight stone was
left twenty years ago because “ It would not pay
at the time.” We recognize these men, and love
them. They live a lonely and frugal life, whose
chief aim is to confide to casual strangers, under
vows of the most honourable secrecy, where
fortunes are lying just for the picking up. Oh, and
it’s for Ballarat Major Smith sits. And C. E. Jones
represented it formerly. What a number of
pleasant recollections these names call up! What
a time the “ Major” had when a stroke of his pen
put barmaids and other nice people to instruct and
wallop the young idea of Victoria! One’s mouth
waters at it. And C. E. Jones and the mint sauce,
and the . Well, Ballarat, it is really about time
you woke up and started something fresh. “Per-
petual motion” is about the only thing you want to
set you on your legs again.
At the meeting held in the Melbourne
Town Hall to oppose the opening of the Museum
Gallery on Sunday, the chief opponents were Mr.
Ormond, Mr. Mirams, and Mr. Harper. Mr.
Ormond is rich enough, so he has said, to live on
the interest of the interest of his interest, and still
endow colleges. His name is widely known for
liberality, but we praise it not so much for its
relative proportion to his income, in which regard
he is behind thousands, as for its prominence
among his fellow millionaires. But his views of
these matters are of the Manse mansey, and he
was bound to be there. Mr. Harper harps ever-
lastingly on the Calvinistic harp for political pur-
Eoses, and his tooting in West Bourke is just
arely sustained by influential men of that kidney.
Of little Mirams’s theological views there is no re-
cord; but as they are flexible enough to enable
him to figure as a hero to the Collingwood yokels,
we have no doubt he sports a big gilt-edged book
of psaums down through the Fitzroy Gardens,
when the gong sounds eleven from St. Jude’s
belfry. On the other side are George Higlnbotham,
with his great three-storey forehead and pure and
honourable life; Bishop Moorhouse, one of the
few men who, like Vaughan, just prevent men of
culture from classifying clergymen in general
with the bonzes of the josshouse; and lastly,
Charles Strong. On the one side appear bats and
doleful creatures, flapping from their mouldy
wings the dust and cobwebs that have settled on
them from the crumbling rafters of some tumble-
down spire of ancient superstition. From the
other side comes the cheery note of young, new
life, springing forth to carol the dawn.
Scarcely an individual who ever reads the
newspapers but has chuckled and gasped over
those inimitable yarns from the American papers
about the “Trotting Horse Reporter”—as cele-
brated throughout civilization as the “ dodgasted”
Spoopendyke, or the bad boy who gets confiden-
tial with the grocery man. But few are aware that
these screaming stories are really written by “a
friend of Maud S.” They are the work of H.
Teneyck White, sporting reporter of the Chicago
Tribune. And the vision of ethereal loveliness,
with pearly tears suffusing her azure eyes, that
used to come and stand timidly in the door of the
sanctum, and ask “Is the sentiment editor in?”
wasn’t such a shadowy creature after all; for to
just such an angel, only a tew weeks back, was the
“Trotting Horse Reporter” married. The lady
was Miss Fanny Driscoll, of Milwaukee, herself a
smart and witty writer and a brilliant poet. When
the affair became known, a graceless wag on a
rival paper thought the chance too good to throw
away, and perpetrated an imaginary account of
the honeymoon in imitation of the bridegroom’s
own style of writing:—“lt was Gwendolyn Ma-
haffy’s marriage day. She had just been married
tojthe horse-reporter, and the mansion of the
eighth Duke ot Milwaukee was ablaze with the
youth and beauty of the town. With rose-red lips
parted slightly to show the teeth gleaming like
ivory in her beautiful mouth, Gwendolyn looked
proudly happy by the side of her husband, as the
bright December sun shone through the huge
antique window, and broke upon her golden hair
in a thousand ripples. Her dress was a marvel
ot dead white Ottoman silk and rose-point
duchess lace. The court train was finished
with a full Russian ruche, tucked on with pen-
dants of cut crystal. The front was cut in battle-
ments that revealed plaitings of satin encrusted
with crystal and tinsel. The tabliere was draped
with a forty-inch flounce, caught up on the left
side with an immense barb of brilliants. The cor-
sage was covered with diamonds and Baroness de
Rothschild roses •; she wore a demi-veil half-hiding
her oval creamy face, and she carried a fan, a mass
of lace and Ceylon pearls. One by one the guests
paid their respects and departed, last among them
being Beryl M’Murty and Aristides Mulcahey, the
bridesmaid and best man. At leng th the bride and
groom were left alone ; and when he had encircled
her waist with his arm, he paused, and asked, in
tones choked with emotion : “Would you do any-
thing I should ask of you, love ?” She nestled her-
self against his manly breast, and murmured
softly ; “ Why, darling, you know I would I What
is it?” He leaned over her, his face betraying his
firm resolve, and his lips almost touching her
beautiful hair, as he hissed into her eartthe baleful
words : “ Promise me to write no more poetry.”
Without raising her head, the beautiful girl
slipped, limp and senseless, from his arms, and fell
on the floor with with a dull, sickening thud.
Laughing sardonically, he rolled a cigarette
between his high-bred, taper fingers, and said “ I
have knocked her out in four rounds.”

Mr. Justice Williams, the youngest of the
Victorian Supreme Court judges, is one of the
most popular men in the Southern colony. He has
never held a seat in Parliament, which to a certain
extent, no doubt, accounts for the favour with
which he is regarded, but the major portion,
perhaps, accrued to him on account of his enthu-
siastic patronage of athletic sports. He is vice-
president of the Victorian Rowing Association,
and president of the M.R.C., and is to be seen at
every regatta. On one occasion, before his eleva-
tion to the bench, he prefaced his address to a
jury with the remark that he felt he would be
unable that day to do justice to his client. He had
just seen in the Argus an announcement of the
defeat of Edward Trickett by Hanlan: had the
result been otherwise, he would have felt so
much happier that he would not have doubted his
ability to win the case. He recently stated that
he walked 20 miles a day for exercise, and one
morning, having to attend the assize court at
Sandhurst, he trudged in to that town from a dis-
tance of 20 miles before breakfast. He was the
Judge who tried the libel case De Mestre v. The
Age, and took a most liberal view of the law in
favour of the paper ; though he also presided at
the trial in which the jury, by his direction, gave a
heavy verdict against The Argus in an action
brought by H. R. Williams, ex-member for Sand-
hurst, who is now contesting the seat against
Angus Mackay, of the Sydney D. T. The Judge
and Mr. Purves, the present leader of the Victorian
criminal bar, were regular frequenters of Jem
Mace’s private boxing saloon. Judge Williams is
by no means the worst amateur boxer in the
Southern colony. As he is young (40), and very
ambitious, a great deal more will probably be
heard of him.
Mr. Joseph Stirling— or, as he is more
commonlv styled, “ Joe” Stirling—the seconder of
the vote of thanks to Redmond at his lecture in
Toowoomba (Q.) on the “Irish National League,”
is no ordinary man. He is a clear-headed, practical
Scotchman, a leading Presbyterian, prominent
temperance man, and a fluent and effective public
speaker. He drops in at Groom’s (the local
member’s) periodical addresses to his constituents,
just to put that versatile politician through his
facings, and to point out certain little discrepancies
between his promises and his performances. Well,
at the meeting in question he clinched Redmond’s
arguments with a telling speech against land-
lordism and in favour of Home Rule, and wound
up with a satirical allusion to Governor Kennedy’s
views on the land question as expounded by His
Excellency at a banquet held in Toowoomba a few
days previously. “ Joe” knows Sir Hercules
Robinson’s masterly orations by heart, and con-
sequently can see little or no merit in those
graceful little commonplaces with which Sir
Arthur Kennedy criticises a bow or returns thanks
for a banquet. As a politician, “Joe” out-Red-
monds Redmond, and laughs to scorn—we grieve
to say—Mr. Fronde on ‘“"The Uses of a Landed
Gentry.” As might be expected, some of the
local Henry Harry Cookes look coldly on him,
taboo him in fact, for the prominent part he took
at the Redmond meeting. There is in Toowoomba
a Parliamentary Debating Class, in which “Joe” is
leader of the Opposition, and, at a recent meeting
of this august body, some ultra-loyalist made
“ Joe’s” conduct the subject of a venomous attack,
in which the complicity-cum-sedition fad was used
with great effect. The majority, however, sided
with “Joe,” and the incipient Parkes got severely
mauled for his attempt to extinguish freedom of
speech.
William Cullen Bryant, the poet, thus
wrote to his mother describing his marriage :
“ Dear Mother, I hasten to send you the melan-
choly Intelligence of what has lately happened to
me. Early on the evening of the eleventh day of
the present month I was at a neighbouring house
in this village. Several people of both sexes were
assembled in one of the apartments, and three or
four others, with myself, in another. At last came
in a little elderly gentleman—pale, thin, with a
solemn countenance, pleuritic voice, hooked nose,
and hollow eyes. It was not long before we were
summoned to attend in the apartment where he
and the rest of the company were gathered. We
went in and took our seats; the little elderly
gentleman with the hooked nose prayed, and we all
stood up. When he had finished, most of us sat
down. The gentleman with the hooked nose then
muttered certain caballstical expressions, which
I was too much frightened to remember, but I
recollect that at the conclusion I was given to
understand that I was married to a young lady by
the name of Frances Fairchild, whom I perceived
standing by my side, and whom I hope in the course
of a few months to have the pleasure of introducing
to you as your daughter-in-law, which is a matter
of some interest to the poor girl, who has neither
father nor mother in the world. I have not
“ played the fool and married an Ethiop for the
jewel in her ear.” I looked only for goodness of
heart, an ingenuous and affectionate disposition, a
good understanding, etc., and the character of my
wife is too frank and single-hearted to suffer me to
fear that I may be disappointed. I do myself
wrong; I did not look for these nor any other
qualifies, but they trapped me before I was aware,
and now I am married in spite of myself. Thus the
current of destiny carries us all along. None but
a madman would swim against the stream, and
none but a fool would exert himself to swim with
it. The best way is to float quietly with the tide.
So much for philosophy—now to business. Your
affectionate son, William.”
A little while ago, Miss Chamberlain, of
Ohio, had the distinction of having succeeded Mrs.
Langtry in the platonic admiration of the Prince
of Wales. She is not so beautiful, but she has the
American freedom of manners, and it was this
that first charmed H.R.H. A man who is so un-
fortunate as to be born a prince is a martyr to
conventionality, and when he finds some one who
treats him as though he-were no holier than any
other man, he is refreshed. The Prince of Wales
saw Miss Chamberlain at a ball, and he was pleased
with her appearance, and sent to know if she
would honour him with a dance. “Dance with
the Prince of Wales! indeed I will. Who wouldn’t
be delighted to dance with the Prince of Wales ?”
The message was delivered as it was sent, and the
prince was charmed. Even the princess sent word
to have the American brought to her. “If the
Princess of Wales wants to know me, let her come
tome; I’m not going to her,” said Miss Chamber-
lain. This message was not delivered. If it had
been, it is pretty certain that the charming prin-
cess would have said at once, as she did later on,
when Miss C. treated her with unroyal familiarity
—“The impertinent woman!” As it was not deli-
vered at the time, however, and Miss Chamberlain
and her friend Miss Work were invited to Sandring-
ham, they went there, and had a “jolly time” with
the princess. Then Albert Edward met them at
Homburg, and they had a jollier time without the
princess. That’s what did it. Alexandra conceived
the strange prejudice that her husband shouldn’t
chaperone two single girls—probably because he
didn’t know enough ; and so when she heard that
ladies there, who were perhaps jealous of his small
attentions to Miss Chamberlain, had not much to
say to them, but a good deal to say of them, she
concluded the lively fair-haired American was a
“minx.” So she cut her, and mother and daugh-
ter received no invitation to the last Sandringham
ball; so the lady who “ delighted to dance with
the Prince of Wales” can travel back to America
as soon as she likes.
It is pretty generally known that not only
does the Princess Louise henpeck her husband—
who, by the wdiy, is also considerably “sat upon”
by her brothers—but that her general behaviour is
by no means such as is expected from the nobility,
let alone royalty. As a fact, we are likely to have
a better chance of really knowing out here some of
the clever Princess’s little peculiarities than folks
at home, for the English papers are careful to i
suppress anything that savours of the “ unbecom- ■
lug.” Now.it is true that,notwithstanding the Queen ,
trained her children well, the Princess Louise has, '
through her thoroughly unconventional and
independent style, given a deal of pabulum to the !
gossips. That romantic episode about Canon t
Duckworth, whom the Princess it is believed really (
loved, and with whom her name became coupled, !
rendered it expedient to adopt measures to allay 1
the excess of public interest which had been (
excited in the prospective match; so a more i
eligible young man was looked out. Louise was I
worried into marrying- him, and the united pair
were shipped off to Canada. The Marquis of Lome
had never been suspected of any especial fitness
for governing a large colony, and the two in their
official capacity have not been a particular
success; but the Queen conceived that a tew years’
foreign residence might not be without benefit
to her sturdy and somewhat angular-minded
daughter, so the plan was tried. It only met
with indifferent results. At first, the Princess was
given to sudden returns, and she’d curiously appear
at Court when least expected. The last time she
made one of her playful “drops-in” from Canada
on J l^ m iy nina ’ s ’ 10 was ordered to return instanter
and do the honours of the Governor-General’s
house as they should be done by the Governor-
General s wife, even if she did happen to be a Prin-
cess. Well, she went, but she didn’t stay much at
home then, but started for a nice little pleasure
excursion round the Dominion, overland to the
Pacific, and back. Altogether, it’s thought the
Princess rather “ scored ” off Her Majesty. If she
hoes not do as she likes, she goes pretty near it;
and she does things that, if she were anybody else
but the Marchioness of Lome and Her Most Gra-
cious Majesty’s daughter, would at the least be
regarded as eccentric, when in England, she
travels about by train, quite alone, makes visits by
herself to country-houses for a week or two, plays
bilnards, flirts a good deal with good-looking young
noblemen ’ en '°y s a good glass of wine as much as
anybody-, and never goes to church if she can pos-
sibly avoid it. In short, were she not a Princess,
one might feel inclined to say she was disposed to
be rapid.” Comparatively independent of her
mother, and completely so of her husband, it is
evident she is not likely to pay much attention to
anyone else. Considering that Lord Lome’s father,
the Duke of Argyll, who is a sort of Ducal Rradical,
and goes as far as he dares with the doctrines of his
party, controls him from one side, and this excess-
ively self-willed young lady makes things lively for
him on the other, we’re afraid the Marquis’ lot is
not a happy one.
The departure of Sir Arthur Kennedy, ex-
Governor of Queensland, at the expiration of his
term, was attended by every manifestation of
good will on the part of the colonists. All classes
joined to give the retiring Governor a loving fare-
well. No one would during the first twelve months
of Sir Arthur’s governorship have been justified
in predicting anything of the kind for his de-
parture. Sir Arthur became exceedingly un-
popular with the working-class immediately on his
arrival, when it transpired that he had brought a
retinue of Chinese servants with him from Hong-
kong. The Chinese fever, which like the inter-
mittent fever of the Gulf country, never entirely
leaves the patient alone, happened to be pretty hot
just at the time, and the introduction of “ leprous
Mongols” by the Governor was regarded as a
deliberate defiance of popular sentiment. Of
course, it was nothing of the kind, but anyone who
had attempted to demonstrate that Sir Arthur
couldn’t have foreseen that the fit would be on
when he arrived, would have, just then, as little
chance of reaching his hearei-s’ intelligence, as any
one who, a month ago, would have had in demon-
strating to the satisfaction of Hicks, or a Herald
man, that Parnell had not been proved to
have something to do with the Phoenix
Park assassinations. Having thus fortuitously
set the working classes against him, poor Sir
Arthur followed up this inauspicious commence-
ment by desperately affronting Society in its most
sensitive point. We allude to Society’s bread-
basket. It had been the custom of all Governors,
since Queensland became a separate colony, to give
a ball at Government House on the Queen’s Birth-
day. This ball was the fete of the year to numbers
of people. Generally about two score of Brisbane
people,and the little contingent of squattocrats who
happened to be in town from time to time, consti-
tuted the circle of the Governor’s acquaintance,
and the regular habitues of Government House on
reception days. At the Governor’s occasional
dinners and dances, the range would be extended
somewhat. But on the Birthday Ball, “ everybody
wot was hanybody” expected, and as a rule, re-
ceived, an invitation. An average attendance at
such balls would be 1200 persons. The company
was miscellaneous; and if your tailor were in a
large way of business, or in the Brisbane Municipal
Council, you might meet him in one corner and
your milkman in the next, on the strength of his
being a considerable landowner (paddocks for the
cows). Evening dress for gentlemen was expected
and generally worn. But etiquette was not over-
strained on these occasions. Mr. Chalks wore his
black frock coat —the one in which he spouted
gospel on Sundays in Little Bethel. Mr. Snipley,
of course, was super-perfect, his figured waistcoat
a splendid vision, and his shirt-front a perfect
Siberia as to extent. But Mr. Chalks had no gloves,
and his hands dominated his whole turn-out, while
Mr. Cleaver, the “wholesale” butcher—who had
slaughter yards on Kedron Brook, and fattened
pigs on offal with a view to the production of
prime dairy-fed pork—was in evening dress, in-
deed, but wore No. 12 blucher boots. ’We won’t
say aught about'the ladies. Girls do certainly
adapt themselves to circumstances more readily
than men. Anyhow, the Birthday Ball is a stupend-
ous institution in Brisbane, and enables the most
unlikely people to remark incidentally, any time
during the ensuing ten months (the next two
devoted to anxious and breathless intriguing for
an invitation to the approaching ball) to amuse
some people and exasperate their own circle of
rivals and emulators, by casually working into
their conversation reminiscences of “ Wen Brisket
and me was at Gov’raent ’Ouse, Sir Harthur ’e
says to me, says ’e .” At these balls, the Gover-
nor used to “ display a splendid hospitality,” as we
used to write in the Courier next morning. That
is to say, he used to let a contract for suppers and
refreshments at so much (say) 6s. 6d. per head, with
attendance thrown in; and simultaneously used to
order from local wine and spirit merchants several
gross of the “extra superfine” champagne and
claret of commerce-the very best public-house
brands, which nearly everybody likely to be pie-
sent was sure to know and respect as being a
shilling per bottle, or, perchance, half-a-crown,
dearer than merely common wine. So everybody
guzzled or nib tiled, and swelled or sipped as
suited their inclination; and what made things
smooth and pleasant at the buffets, was the fact
that the attendants had been rounded up from all
the pubs, in the city, and were well known to a
large proportion of the gentlemen present, who
were thus enabled to accost individuals figuring
for the night as belonging to the Vice-Regal
menage, with an off-hand easy familiarity, by name,
as “Charles, some champagne for this lady,” or,
“ Trotter, some of them cakes.” Sir Arthur Ken-
nedy, at his first Birthday Ball, scandalised every-
body by providing the meagrest commissariat
ever known. Sandwiches and coffee were about
the staple, and not enough of these. The guests
viewed the provisions with dismay, declared them-
selves famished, and after the fste raised a howl
of disgust and indignation. Sir Arthur, at that
crisis, was decidedly the most unpopular Governor
who had ever ruled Queensland. In succeeding
years, however, he repaired the omission of his
first frte, and, being really a gentleman of true
kindness and unaffected good nature, the Queens-
landers learned in time to recognise his sterling
qualities, and to admire him for them. Thus I;
came to pass that the dismal commencement of his
reign was succeeded by a bright conclusion.
The executors of the late Dean Backhaus
(R.C.) of Sandhurst, have paid in £6142 as probate
duty on his estate.... William Mills, aged 94, who
died at Emerald Hill (Vic.), leaves 13 children, 63
grand children, and 54 great grand children. A
useful colonist. ...A Cooma solicitor has succeeded
to a fortune of £30,000. ...Ivo Bligh sailed by the
Rosetta for London, last week. It is reported that
the ship carried no boats. The davits were re-
quired for Ivo’s stock of shoes England’s
wealthiest baronet, says an English paper, is Sir
John Ramsden, of Byram, Yorkshire, who has
£140,000 a year. W. J. Clarke, of Melbourne, who
is one of England’s baronets, has as much or more
than that income—probably more ...The third
daughter of the late Hon. J. Bowie Wilson died a
few days after her father. She had long been ill of
consumption.... The will of the late Martin Shana-
han (father-in-law of Sir Patrick Jennings) has
been proved under £173,000. ..Mr. Bossley Bur-
dekin’s will was proved under £62,0(K)....At
the recent marriage of Mr. Charles Bright and
Mrs. Annie Pillars, Mr. A. B. Camm, the Unitarian
Minister, was requested to act as registrar on the
occasion as a friend of both parties. This act that
gentleman kindly performed. The marriage was
one of civil contract as required by law, and there
was no religious ceremony, as such would have
been opposed to the principles held by the con-
tracting parties—An ante-mortem photograph of
the deceased Rev. Norbert Quirk, was taken by
Mr. Riisfeldt, of Sydney, while the dead priest’s
body was “lying in state.” Professor Walker, who
was drowned in Auckland harbour, lost his life
through the capsizing of an open boat. Professor
Tucker, his companion, was rescued in an in-
sensible condition. Deceased, whose body has not
been recovered, was single, and but twentv-six
years of age. He was a fellow of Queen’s College,
and Second Wrangler in 1879.
A descendant of the famous Portuguese
navigator, Magellan, appeared the other day in a
Paris Police Court, and apologised for having to
detain the magistrate—explaining that he was
“Jeronimo Collao de Maghalaens deGamaMonez
Vellasco Sarmento Alarcao Bulhoes de San Maria
de Salema.” Passanante, who tried to kill King
Humbert, in 1878, is fastened to the wall of a nearly
dark cell by a five-foot chain riveted to his ankle.
He has become imbecile The Countess de Bardl,
a niece of the Comte de Chambord, recently urged
her uncle to re-enter Paris on horseback, sur-
rounded by Legitimist cavaliers, and wearing the
white plume of Henry IV. “My niece,” he said,
“you speak like a heroine; but it would never do
for the king of France to be arrested by a police-
man and taken to the lock-up.” Mr. Gladstone
hates tobacco but drinks several glasses of wine
dally. Mark Twain doesn’t drink, but has smoked
immoderately for thirty-eight years. Anthony
Trollope constantly had a cigar in his mouth. He
died. James Payne smokes the whole time he is
engaged in composition, and has done so for thirty
years. He likewise drinks claret and champagne.
The late Charles Darwin smoked two cigarettes,
drank one glass of wine, and constantly snuffed
every day A daughter of Napoleon I. and of a
young lady of noble family whom Napoleon met
at Cologne in 1811, has just died in that city. She
was known as the Countess Falkenberg, and for
the last thirty years of her life had been so poor
that she was compelled to work as a dressmaker,
and was buried at the expense of the parish.
Another of our youthful beliefs “gone bung!”
Our teacher told us Napoleon was a kind of human
iceberg, and that’s why he became a great man...
Sir. Burnand, editor of London Punch, has been
twice married, and has 14 children. If we have
ever spoken disparagingly of the gentleman’s
humour, we beg his pardon. He is working
against great odds—A Fenian-American paper
has printed “faithful likenesses” of the 21 men
committed for the Phoenix Park murders. If the
portraits published are in truth faithful likenesses,
it is difficult to see how any one of the subjects
can escape the gallows. The only wonder is that
so many heavy villains were concerned in the
murder of only two men. Each one of them looks
as if he were good for at least six murders on his
own account—Here is the whole of one of the
late Baron Martin’s summings-up Gentlemen
of the jury, you have heard the evidence and the
speeches of the learned counsel. If you believe
the old woman in red, you will find the prisoner
guilty; if you do not believe her, you will find
him not guilty.” And here is all he said to a noto-
rious criminal whom he had remanded for sen-
tence:—“Prisoner at the bar, you’re a very bad
man. You’ll have ten years or it— Miss Margaret
Emmett, niece of the Irish patriot, has recently
died in New York at the ripe age of ninety. Her
father, brother of t’.ie “ only ” Emmett, had several
interviews with Napoleon, on whom he pressed the
,invasion of Ireland, but Buony was too busy at the
time. Otherwise, of course, we'd all be French-
men now—The lady who became notorious as
having been charged with poisoning Mr. Bravo,
the barrister, at Balham Priory, Surrey, in April,
1876, died on April 3rd Herbert Spencer’s health
is failing terribly; he now declines all Invitations.
... .The oldest (?) inhabitant of the Dominion died
on March 13th at Lake Magnetic. She was an Bng-
lish-wotnao, named Mary Hugh Graves, aud had
reached U 7 years of age.

IT is not the clearness or. condition alone in
BULL-DOG ALE that preserves this brand
first in public estimation. Common bitter crude
beei'S are made very fine, but no other brand has
the same mellow vinous character, the fullness on

The special feature of this Company is the fair-
ness with which both depositors and borrowers are
dealt with. ....
The Company is prepared to make temporary ad-
vances on the deposit of deeds, or to assist persons
to build, without enforcing upon them the usual
weekly or fortnightly repayments while the build-
ing is in course of erection.
Loans may be repaid at any time, interest being
chargeable upon the actual amount lent, from the
date of loan till the date of repayment only.
Every wire has been taken to save the borrower
any uhneccessary expense, and to charge him in-
terest only on the amount lent, and not
upon the amount applied for, as is us-
ually the case. Depositors with the Company
receive not only a fair rate of interest for their
money, but will also participate in the profits. This
advantage, which it is only fair that depositors
should receive, has never been afforded them by
any other bank or building society in New South
Wales. , , . _
Depositors may withdraw the whole or part of
their deposits at any time without previous notice,
receiving interest at the rate of 5 percent, per an-
num for the period of deposit.
I ntercst at the following rates allowed :
Deposits for 13 months .. .. 7 per cent.

* * ♦
We went on Monday night to Rignold’s
benefit. We had several reasons for this. In the
first place, we don’t care about the theatre on
Saturday night, save under exceptional circum-
stances. Saturday nights are generally first nights
at the Royal, and having attended at duty’s call,
we have been haunted. Yes, haunted by forms
and faces which haunt “first nights!” haunted by
familiar shirt-fronts—by spectral sets of studs—by
pronounced probosces; and haunted above all by
rows of critics of all hues and sexes—dear souls
whom we have sat in company with through so
many ‘premiers;” whose nice little pleasant
notices we have so cheerfully anticipated; and
whose smiles we have so often sought for in vain.
When asleep, we have dreamed of that weird and
terrible dress-circle. We have seen it in our
dreams as we have seen it by day-light. Sombre
and ghastly, with phantom first-nighters flitting
by with a bat-like whirr, and hovering amidst
the dark shadows and the dusty covers;
some shaking their curls redolent with hair-
oil; one striking his beard, the cut of which has
the smack of royalty; one shaking her reticule;
and one pressing his hand lovingly on an M.S.
drama in the breast-pocket of his coat. So the
ben. being a double-barrelled one, we chose the
night on which George would be honoured by the
presence of the vice-regal party. There was a
liberal programme. “Alone/’ a three-act comedy
in which—the bill stated—(and playbills. like circu-
lars of joint stock companies, never lie) Mr.
Rignold had played (during 300 nights at the Court
Theatre; and “ Black Eyed Susan.” the William of
which George had played (vide playbill) “ at the
T.R. Drury Lane, and throughout Great Britain
and the United States with enormous success.”
* # *
Very good. To put “Alone” upon a
critical test, however, it is impossible to come to
any other conclusion than that “ Herman Merl-
vale and Palgrave Simpson’s magnificent comedy ”
(as Mr. Rignold calls it) is of an extreme and deso-
late poverty. The situations are old, the dialogue
is trite, and the action is dull. In this Mr. Rignold
plays an old Colonel; who, first, is really blind,
and then pretends he is blind. But blind, or seeing,
Colonel Chalice, as depicted by Mr. Rignold, is
always a bore. We could forgive him being a
bore cheerfully ; what we can’t forgive him, how-
ever, is being a pantaloon. In his emotional
moments he was not the brave and stalwart old
Colonel, but “the lean and slippered pantaloon” of
Jacques’ speech ; in all that the Colonel was never
lean, and only in one instance slippered. There
was to our minds nothing artistic in Mr.
Rignold’s “Colonel ” Chalice. All he ever
knew of it, he has lost in the watery
auet a pens and the shipwrecks of melodrama.
But if Rignold never caught on, what were the
rest like ?fPoor Hodson was more “galvanic” than
Uriah Heep—to say nothing of Fluellen ; and
Watton was almost, but not quite completely, out
of it as the Doctor. Mr. J. R. Grevllle gave us a
representation of Shatton Strawless calculated to
make the angels weep. It couldn’t have made
them laugh, anyhow! He was dressed in a ludi-
crous hat and an impossible pair of pants, and he
gave us a performance which was suggestive of
The party by the name of Johnson,” the man in
“ No. 1 Round the Corner,” Mr. Box—anything, in
short, but comedy. But it was Mr. J. K. Greville.
And Mr. J. R. Greville was pleased, of course, that
it should be so considered.
* * #
Of the ladies, Miss Brabrook Henderson
carried off the palm as Mrs. Thornton. She
was lively—very lively—at times even skittish.
But she was picturesque. Like “3f port”—she
was “good but old.” But we ask why was Miss
AYatts-Phlllips (we always forget the “Roland”)
put up in the part of Maude Trevor? AVe ask
this that the young lady may realise our surprise
at the exceeding originality of her performance.
It was a performance that, in our opinion, lacked
thought, study—even the ordinary intelligence
one would expect from the daughter of the author
of “ The AYoman in Mauve,” and “ Maude’s Peril.”
But it was chaff. And we do what the wind
does with chaff. AYe blow it away.
* * *
We’ll shelve “ Black-eyed Susan,” and say
the Rignold Company left after the performance,
for Melbourne. They give way here to Bland
Holt, who opens on Saturday with “Mankind.”
During'the interval the theatre has been cleaned
and beautified; and we may hope during Bland’s
season to laugh during the comic scenes even if
we nave to cry over the pathetic ones.

Anri what about the Opera House and
about Manola, which is the gayest, brightest, and
prettiest thing ever seen out of Paradise—and we
have never been there. Tell us about Kate Chard,
Ivanova, Raymond, and the pretty rest, including
the adorable Raymond (caught on to a hanker too,
we hear) who are all smiles, music, and mollcts.
Tell us also of Harry Power, as the portly prince
who is one moving grin; and Appleby, who has got
the hang of true comedy. Then tell us of lovely
melody, of superb schenes, of flashing fountains,
and, of twinkling toes. Tell us all this, dear old
baldheads, and go again.

LAURA!
Petrarch loved a Laura more
Thau the laurel of Apollo,
Singer of the days of yore.
You and we know what we know,
Yet we’ve found a Laura, 10,
Who can beat your Laura hollow!
Laura, laughing Laura, she
To our secret heart has stole a
Way with all her grace and glee—
Horae ? address ? why, certainly!
Raymond is her name, and she
Is a student in “ Manola.”

The correspondent of the London Era
“ hears of the death in Calcutta of the lady
known to the profession as Jessie Raymond/’
Very good; Wo don’t deny the lady is dead; we
simply say that Death seems to agree with her
exceedingly well. If we could look when we are
dead as she looked when we saw her last—which
was about a week ago—we would cut the connec-
tion of this hollow world to-morrow. Miss Jessie
Raymond (or Mrs. Glover) is now the happy wife of
a gentleman well known in the profession out
here—Mr. R. F. Roper. Mr. Roper informs us that
she is excessively alive, and he ought to know.

Let us with a tuneful mouth
Sing a song of Jimmy South ;
And to start the song along
Say he oped at Wollongong
Monday last—we’ve not forgot,
When he shows them what was what.
Bah I this song begins to doze,
He will sing the rest in prose.

Jimmy has taken a first-rate comedy com-
pany with him. We forget their names, but that
is of no consequence. Are their names not to be
found on the bead-roll of fame? They are all
illustriously missed anyhow. With our character-
istic discretion we don’t say by whom. Very glad
by the way are we to notice that Mrs. South is
again able to play, and that the unscareablo
Whittington is still advance agent for Mr. South.
Jimmy and his company go to Kiama, Bega, Bom-
bala, Cooraa, and finally, heaven, we suppose. It
is hard that we should never have a chance to see
him again.

We have received from Mackay (Q.) an
account of Mr. Bandmann’s performance of
“ Hamlet ” there. Our correspondent writes
current© calamo and is caustic besides. Scattered
here and there through the throe folio sheets
of his notice are such opithetical gems as
“Temple of Tragedy,” “Zion of Tragedy,” and
many others which betray the master hand. Con-
sequently we consider that we have been honored
by a communication from a citizen of high stand-
ing up there—the Clerk of Petty Sessions, perhaps,
or even the Mayor! We are inclined to think it
was the clerk, however, as all the wox-ds are
spelt correctly. We may be pardoned for being
proud of this condescension on the part of his
worship or his clerkship, whichever it is. Up till
now our country correspondence has mostly been
with the local bellman or poundkeeper. As
might be expected, our present correspondent—
may your worship live for ever, may your clerk-
ship never die—has the fastidious tastes of his
class. Ho objected, for instance, to there being no
Castle of Elsinore in the play and to Hamlet
standing out against a background of ragged gum
trees (the stock scene in the Mackay theatre, we are
informed), to splutter his soliloquy. Really, now—
though, of course, we defer to the more refined
tastes of the Mackay exclusives—we think that
this is rather exacting. It seems, also, that there
was some bother about the Ghost—the gentleman
who was to have played this part was playing
poker and held too good a hand to come, or some-
thing else prevented him, but, anyhow, “ a gentle-
man from the audience kindly consented to fill up
the gap”—by the way. we can’t just see how the
absence of a Ghost could make a gap—and did it so
well than an influential section of the audience
proposed to make him stick to the part altogether.
It was only after a great deal of persuasion that
they consented not to kill him. We have often
felt the same way; there are scores we know who
make very indifferent men, but who, we are per-
suaded, would make excellent ghosts. Anyhow,
Mr. Bandmann’s performance was not properly
perly appreciated in Mackay—which is hard either
upon Mackay or Mr. Bandmann; we don’t know
which. Daniel has had better luck at Rockhamp-
ton.
Sir Daniel Cooper, Bart.
We give in our front page an excellent
portrait of Sir Daniel Cooper, Bart., now in
England. The people of the present time
know Sir Daniel mainly from his connection
with the huge Waterloo estate near Sydney,
but his services in the past are closely
identified with the history and progress of
the country, and cannot be forgotten. Both
here and in England, Sir Daniel has at
all times exhibited large public spirited.
To him may almost entirely be ascribed the
improved condition of the wool trade of
Australia in the home markets. He backed
up all political efforts in this direction by
some trenchant articles in the Press. Sir
Daniel gave £lOOO to the fund for the relief
of the widows and orphans of those who fell
in the Crimea, and contributed £5OO per
annum during the continuance of the war.
He received a baronetcy for his active
liberality at the time of the Lancashire
cotton distress. He is now sixty-two years
of age.
We notice that J. S. Fry and Sous, of
Bristol and London, “ the biggest cocoa people in
the world,” have established an office in our city.
The remains of a man have been dug out
of the ruins of Pompeii, with both hands resting
on his stomach. The building in which ho was
found is supposed to have been a sixpenny
restaurant.
The trade between N.S.W. and Queensland
is every day developing, and now that the sugar
industry of the Northern colony is in full swing an
additional impetus has been given to our indus-
tries. One big line of trade is in the heavy de-
scription of vehicles for use on settlements, in
which an enormous business is done. Some idea
of this may bo obtained on visiting the extensive
works of Messrs. Goodwin and Son, waggon
builders, &c., George-street, opposite Christ
Church. The name of Goodwin mis been identi-
fied with the principal business in this line in the
colony, and Mr. Henry Goodwin having now
succeeded to the proprietary management, a big
step in advance is being made. The extensive
works of Bull and Co. have been absorbed by the
enterprising proprietor, and work is carried on
with great energy and success. Upwards of 126
waggons and drays of the best description arc now
being manufactured for Queensland and our own
colony. The employes are the most experi-
enced hands obtainable, and some have been in
the employ for over twenty years. The works are
well worth a visit.
The S.A.J. Club were again blessed with

“ That fellow is so highly colored that ho
reminds me of a chromo,” remarked a man of a
schnapper-nosed, dissipated-looking creature in a
marine suburb.
“ He reminds me more of an engraving than a
chromo,” remarked a bystander.
“ How so ?’
“ Well, you see, an engraving always has a glass
in front of it, and a chromo hasn’t.”

THE BULLETIN.
May 10 1883.


From the New Yobk Economist just to
hand, we see that the sleeping-parlour cars which
our ex-Dlctator ordered for this country are ready
for shipment at Troy, and that one is “ named Lady
Parkes, after the Governor-General (sic) of New
South Wales, and one Lady Robertson, after the
wife of the.Rallroad Commissioner.” There is some
other colonial information supplied by the paper
which is equally refreshing, and which speaks
volumes for that sly humour which so few knew
before the Economist reached us, that Sir Henry
possessed. We learn that “a fast train runs from
Sydney to Melbourne by day and returns at night,”
and also that “ trains have been running over this
road for months, but there have heretofore been
neither sleeping nor parlour cars in Australia.” It
appears from the article that “ the Australian Com-
missioners considered this [the car manufactured
for us now] to be the best combination of sleep-
ing cars,” and so ordered two of them, to be
named as we have stated. The carriages seem to
be quite an inspiration if all we hear of them be
true, since the saloons in the day time are quite
guiltless of the slightest thing to suggest the com-
ing snare. There is a line smoking-room attached
to each, and lavatories on a gorgeous scale ; the
car being convertible either way in ten minutes.
We shouldn’t believe this, though, unless we read
it in au American paper. But the general public
needn’t shriek for merriment yet. The “ revolving
arm-chairs,” the Axminster carpets, and the en-
amelled and gold panelling will have pretty well
had the gloss taken off them before the ungilded
have a chance of testing their softness and beauty •
M.P.’s and their wives, county Whereats and their
members, Little Gussies on journeys, etc., will
monopolise both Lady P. and Lady R. In-
deed, as most of these dignitaries want a car-
riage to themselves, it is just possible this
generation may never luxuriate in the elegance
Parkes ordered for us in the days when he was
Dictator, and which come to hand now that he is
dust. Therefore, our joy is of a subdued descrip-
tion. As, however, the cars are not yet paid for,
and might never \be (for nothing is certain, except
that Pastor Allen will take “twice pudding”), Sir
Henry would do well on their arrival here to cele-
brate them with an Owed. In the King Cambysses
vein—eh—
“ Hail cars, that o’er the sleepers glide,
The Members’ joy 1 the dead-heads’ pride,” etc.
That’s the strain !

The editor of the Tumut paper (we forget
its name( appeal's to extend good-nature to the
borders of Quixotism Ho has apparently made
the acquaintance of a colonial champagne-man,
and lie writes In his journal thus:—“Give mo an
order for him; I get no commission, but his cham-
pagne is really good.” This by the way;—and
merely us having something whimsical In it in the
realms of introduction. But where we are con-
cerned is here. We are told that Sir James Martin
and Judge Forbes have “ given considerable orders
to the manufacturer of this beverage. “We and a
lot of other people will be sorry for this. We
have, it will be remembered, only just welcomed,
with effusion, Sir James back to health again.
When he was sick we pined; and many were the
anxious inquiries we made at Numantia—patiently
waiting in the hall for the last bulletin about His
Honor, while the cook kept guard over the coats
and umbrellas. But though we dearly love his
Honor (as, indeed, we adore Judge Forbes), the
health of their Honors is not our only ground for
alarm in the matter of the “considerable orders”
they have given for the Tumut editor’s friend’s
champagne. It is written upon our hearts
that no man who drinks Colonial champagne can
be considered a free agent. We are naturally of a
cheerful, gentle, and retiring disposition. No
sucking-dove roars, as a general rule, with more
mellow mildness than we do. Though, at times we
may appear to wield the press-knout with Potts-
like pnrenzy, we are only a few stone weight of
gentility inside a suit of modest cut when we heave
in sight of the family doorstep. And yet, on one
occasion, we were beguiled by a Bardolph of this
street into drinking sparkling wine that owed its
nativity to the vineyards of the soil. That evening
we kicked the cradle, strangled the canary, and
beat the dog. We wore afterwards told that our
speech was bellicose—our maimer offensive. It
was even whispered as far down our street as the
butcher’s shop that we had, within a few yards of
our ancestral halls, ogled fair tobacco-twisters,
and (yes, that is the word) “mugged” a barmaid.
Very well, then. Judges are, after all, only mortal.
And Ave tremble while wo say it. All right.
What show, we ask, then, have the poor pri-
soners got with judges who give “ consider-
able orders” for Colonial champagne? Lot
their Honors try their utmost to temper jus-
tice with mercy, and the justice will get all the
best of it. It was our intention to have inaugu-
rated our new series by the commission of several
crimes ; but we don’t think we’ll do it now. When
wo see the Herald boys carrying their babies in
the gloaming across the Domain, virtue palls on
us, and wo long to bo wicked. Now, however, we
hesitate. Wo are fond of committing a crime or
two, but when it comes to being tried by Judges
who, give “considerable orders” for Colonial
champagne, we don’t see our way at present to bo
sinful.
* * * *
We see that Mr. Roberts has received, at
the hands of Mr. Justice Windeyer (to whom no
suspicion of colonial champagne would seem to
attach) a sentence of some eight years for cutting
the throat of the racehorse Terminus. Mr.
Roberts was down in Sydney at one time, and we
gloried in his friendship. We made a good deal of
him then, and we naturally feel annoyed now that
we did not make more of him. But how were we
to know that he would ever become so distin-
guished ? The law seems to consider it intensely
criminal to cut the throat of a racehorse. You
can, indeed, hardly do anything now, except take
Town Hall contracts, without being punished for
it. But, without being obtrusive in our sympathy
for Mr. Roberts, we may casually mention that he
is a man of a line and delicate feeling. When he
was committed at Hay, and bail was refused, he was
engaged—yes, very much engaged—to be married.
And he wedded the object of his choice, by special
permission, inside the gaol walls. The ceremony, the
ring, and a kiss between the iron grille— ctvoila.
And now that Mr. and Mrs. Roberts may be said to
be disposed of, wo come to the horse. Well, that
horse has won a race since Mr. Roberts’s convic-
tion, and (the horse) laughs so loudly now, sixteen
hours out of the twenty-four, that the landlord’s
eldest sons have to take turn about on the gal-
vanized iron of the loose-box, in order to keep the
roof on.
* * *
It is a mild joke, of course. But, if we are
to believe Mr. Barley, mild jokes are popular. The
only thing that would seem to militate against them
at present, so far as we can learn, is that nobody
reads them. “ Wholesome fun,” which has been
immortalised by the hon. gentleman, whom we
welcome with empressement from the Bordeaux
Exhibition, at which he was a distinguished—and
we hope active —commissioner, should, if influence
could ensure popularity, for little haliv&rnes, cause
them to be indeed in request But the question
seems to be, and it is “a nice legal question”—is
the influence of Mr. Barley sufficient to make
small jokes popular.? Methinks it is; therefore we
reprint one from the Herald. Here it is:—
“Summer Hill.—To let, Regent-street, Summer
Hill, a horse, containing 5 rooms, kitchen, bath-
room, plenty of water, large yard; rent, £1
per week. Key and particulars next door.”
This Is funny, is it not ? “ A home with five rooms,
a kitchen, bathroom, and a flue large yard;” to say
nothing of the ’* key and particulars next door. ’
'Phis is the kind of item we have been looking out
for ever since the Cion tart libel case; in widen Mr.
Barley made his memorable statement re our little
Punch, to which we wish every possible prosperity.
There is no satire intended here, but we are quite
honest in our aspirations in this respect. We trot
out, therefore, on this occasion, a nice mild, meek
little pleasantry just as a feeler. You see there Is
no harm in it. A horse, with five r but why
explain? And, if we could only believe, as we
could wish to do, that all the people who love us
will love this particular style, we could be almost
happy. But the effect on us, after reading: this
par., is to make us almost miserable. Strange I
There you are! People are never satisfied I
Here, now, our junior contemporary in Hunter-
street has been sending a critical young mission-
ary round the Sydney cow-yards, and showing up
the milk supply, we suppose that the Herald
people are. In the wealth begotten of gorgeous
godliness, independent of the milkman. That his
cry for them has no terrors. It is on this snugly in-
dependent position we conceive that the anti-milk
policy was inaugurated. This is, in keeping with
the usual heartlessly selfish method of our con-
temporary when treating of social matters. We
have been purchasing milk for a considerable
time at 3d. per pint, and we have been glad to get
it. When he has left it we have enjoyed it: when
he has not left it we have yearned for it. Wc never
inquired where our milkman resided; and for
reasons of our own (which need not bo particu-
larised) [Certainly not.—Bd. B.] we have never
looked upon the cart. The love of milk is one of
the weaknesses which are inherent to mankind.
Mr. Micawber was extremely partial to milk, if we
are to judge from the amount of his outstanding
account. And so was his small servant. Who can
forget this ? “ Has my small account been heerd
on ? ” asked the milkman of the small ser-
vant. “It will be attended to immediate,”
was the reply (prompted by an upstairs
echo of the small servant. “Are you fond of milk?”
enquired the milkman. “Yes, I likes it,” was the
reply. “ Then, you don’t have none to-morrow —
not a mossel o’ milk do you have to-morrow.”
The small servant then appeared to console her-
self with the idea of having some to-day; and so
the scene closes in—not without its moral. Mr.
Micawber never thought of asking any awkward
questions about his milk. He was satisfied to got
it. Indeed, the Herald young party is the first
man wo have ever heard of as opening up the
grisly horror of the milk-walk. The world is
millions of years old—(by saying this we sacrifice
our future hope of benefit of clergy)—but yet
everybody seems to have been satisfied with their
milk before this Herald reporter “ lot up” on the
cow-keepers. Prom all we have heard to the
contrary, Noah was content with his daily quart,
and Nero, and Joseph, and Herpd, and other gentle-
men whose memories we infinitely respect; and tq
come later down—still careering in the classics—
there was Box, the immortal creation of Maddison
Morton—what did he say on the eve of setting out
to work ? “ Mrs. Bouncer,” he exclaimed, “ take
me in a ha’porth of milk, and let it stand.
Hike the cream to rise to the top." No suspicion
here, you see! Our milk wo have accepted in a
similarly cheerful spirit. If, when putting the rum
into the milk we have found it has curdled, why
we have put the milk into the rum; and if we have
discovered that that has curdled, why we have
drunk it with moody thankfulness, and never dis-
tressed our minds by any awkward ruminations in
which lacteal logic was embodied. What, there-
fore, must be our feelings when we read of one
Elace where the cows drink from a “ well that has
een formed by sinking into the ground an old
barrel, and its covering is an old wooden case. But
the most noticeable thing about the well is the
water it contains, for the surface of the water is
covered with a frothy scum, which gives the well
the appearance of a cesspit. With this scum driven
to the sides of the barrel, in the desire to raise
, some of the fluid as clean as possible, the water
. may be brought up better than it looks: but even
i then it is very objectionable; and, to make things
; worse, there is, quite close to the well, and on
- higher ground, a large heap of cow and horse
• manure, which has the appearance of never
being properly cleared away, and which,
whenever rain falls, must drain into the
well.” And, it must be, hut in a pensivb
frame of mind we read that the spirit of
3 typhoid fever seems to hover round cow-sheds,
> and that pale-faced girls with ominously short-cut
1 hair (who have just ‘‘got over it ”) are the presid-
-1 ing Patiences at the metropolitan milk-pails ! Of
1 course, all our [sympathies are with the milkmen!
3 The young gentleman who wrote the article is
f evidently no more dependent for his milk supply
1 on the much-maligned milkmen. He has, in all
3 probability, contracted for the half of a goat or
3 the sixth of a cow. 8o he can jeer at the poor pur-
-1 veyor, and metaphorically set the heel of his
3 blucher upon him and flatten him out. But it
3 shall never be said of us that we did not stand by
6 the poor and the oppressed. Manure in our milk—
“ and why not? Have we not sand in our sugar,

does not bawl personalities up the staircase, we

A fine place—the police court.
P After a Ballarat revival meeting, we read,
e several converted Chinamen joined the whites in
t singing “ We’re bound for the Promised Land.”
s The audience knew, however, that they were
s bound for somebody’s hen-roost.
High Church is good. It is not low. Now,
away down in the sunny South, or, for the matter
of that, away somewhere in a big Northern metro-
polis, is a fashionable church, where a man once
condemned to death holds the post of honour.
This gentleman, when given to frivolity, stuck up
a store with firearms, and because he couldnx
carry off the coin, used his shooting-irons in a
rather ferocious style. Murder was his intent, and
he seriously wounded the arresting constable.
The case was so desperate that his sentence was
death, without hope of reprieve. The jury forgot
to add—“ recommended to mercy on account of
his respectable connectionsbut it was all the
same, tor his sentence was commuted to fifteen
years. While in prison his respectable breeding
began soon to show itself. He gagged a fellow-
prisoner, and telliag him he was going to heaven,
proceeded to break out of gaol. He was captured
on the roof of a wing—and got an extra sentence.
This gentleman is now high ohureh. Let us prey.
PEPPER AND SALT.
BALLAD OF A BAD BOY.
Children, dear, If you will listen to the story we
shall tell.
You shall hear of somethings, children, will reward
your patience well;
You shall hear of two small brothers who were
happy herding cows,
And as much of other matters as the editor allows*
They were sons of a selector In the wild and won-
drous West—
Where the sun shines on the Lachlan, gilding each
small ripple’s nest,
Till the breast of the bright waters looks a sheet of
golden mail—
And their father was a dummy on a most extensive
scale.
Jack was one and Jim the other, you could not tell
each from each
By their faces—you could only separate them by
their speech.
Very good and very pious was the little urchin
Jim ;
As for Jack, a prayer or whipping, they were just
the same to him.
Jim, when he would break a basin, he would own
it, plump and flat.
And get licked ; but Jack, he always blamed it on
the poor tom-cat ;
And, when Jack would rob the cupboard, ho would
put the blame on Jim,
And lie down outside and chuckle when ho heard
the howls of him.
When at school, Jack was too idle and too fond of
fun and play.
To do anything but crib from Jim his lessons day
by day;
And when Jim got the first prize which he
deserved beyond a doubt,
Jack he gave him a black eye, as soon as ever they
got out.
Jim disliked to go to Sunday-school; Jack ne’er
made any bones—
But when Jim was praying inside, be was outside
throwing stones ;
And whenever the good teacher said : “ Each
Christian had a cross
To bear,” Jim heard a Jingle—Jack was playing
pitch-and-toss.
So from day to day they grew up by sunny Lach-
lan’s side,
And the bad boy was, as usual, his dummy father’s
pride ;
And that father he would fondly say “My brave
little bull-pup,
Won’t you make a famous dummy, like your pa,
when you grow up I”
But for Jim, though in truth-telling he was pain-
fully exact,
Though he had a heap more virtues than the good
boy in the tract,
In the matter of appearance he was only just
so-so—
That is thinner than an axe-edge and as ugly as a
crow.
What became of them at last? Well, now we’ll
end this in a crack.
One of them took holy orders. Jim, or course ?
Oh, no, sir, Jack !
Now he’s well-dressed, fat, and holy—and the other,
what of him?
He’s a scoffer and a sinner, and his signature is—
JIM.
A SYDNEY SHAVE.
Hairdresser, (to new Customer): —“You see, sir, this being your first visit to my shop, I
haven’t yet quite got the run of your face. Oh, by the way, would you like to take your
ear with you ? I’ll just wrap it in a bit of paper.—Next!”
INTAGLIOS.
In Vain.
Sister, sing
Some sweet thing:
With a glad refrain,
And a ring,
Which shall bring
Back the Spring again!
Some old strain
That we twain
Sang when we did string
Daisy chain.
Or did stain
Small hands berrying.
I took wing—
Sister sing—
In the roses reign.
That past Spring,
Home to bring
Broken heart and brain.
You were fain
To remain
Where the old thoughts cling;
Yours the gain,
Mine the pain,
Honey yours, mine sting.
Ah, you sing
Back the Spring
Sister, dear, in vain!
For the Spring
Cannot bring
Me my dreams again.

[For the Bulletin.]
Arrayed as if for a feast,
Her hand on the hilt of the sword.
And the passionate blood of the East
Flushing up in a dusky red;
In a dusky and dark rose-red,
From the curve of her crimson lips
To the veins of her white forehead.
The deep death-draught was poured,
Her hand on the hilt of the sword,
And a sudden and swift eclipse
Came over the eyes of the lord.
The haughty Assyrian lord;
And he dropped the cup from his lips
As he sat at the banquet-board*
Slowly the daylight dies,
Her hand on the hilt of the sword,
But the gleam of her great black eyes
Shines out in the gloom of the tent,
In the gloom of the tenebral tent,
And burns in implacable hate
On the face of the foe of the Lord.
The heart of her deep intent,
Her hand on the hilt of the sword.
And the arm that knew not relent
Were bared for the bidding of fate,
For the pitiless fiat of fate,
And the scorn of him who had scorned
The God whom her people adored.
In jewels and gold adorned,
Her hand on the hilt of the sword.
She neither woke him nor warned;
But the sword’s blue blade was bare,
In the dim light cruel and bare.
And the soul of the woman was dark,
And her face no longer fair.
In the dusk of the dead year’s light,
Her hand on the hilt of the sword,
In crimson, and gold, and white,
A woman walks out on the sward
With a solemn and sombre stare.
Out into the heart of the night.

Josephine.
We did not meet In courtly hall,
Where birth and beauty throng.
Where luxury holds festival,
And wit awakes the song;
We met where darker spirits meet.
In the home of sin and shame,
Where Satan shows his cloven hobf,
And hides his titled name;
And she knew she could not be, Love,
What once she might have been;
But she was kind to me. Love,
My pretty Josephine.
We did not part beneath the sky.
As warmer lovers part;
Where night conceals the glistening eye,
But not the throbbing heart;
We parted on the spot of ground.
Where we first had laughed at love.
And ever the jests were loud around.
And the lamps were bright above.
The heaven is very dark. Love,
The blast is very keen,
But merrily rides my bark, Love,
Good-night, my Josephine.
She did not speak of ring or vow,
But filled the cup of wine,
And took the roses from her brow
To make a wreath for mine;
And bade me, when the gale should lift
My light skiff o’er the wave.
To think as little of the gift
As of the hand that gave;
Go gaily o’er the sea, Love,
And find your own heart's queen.
And look not back at me. Love,
Your humble Josephine.
That garland breathes and blooms no more,
Past are those idle hours;
I would not, could I choose, restore,
The fondness or the flowers.
Yet oft their withered witchery
Revives its wonted thrill,
Remembered not with passion’s sigh.
But oh! remembered still;
And even from your side, Love,
And even from this scene,
One look is o’er the tide, Love,
One thought with Josephine.
Alas! your lips are rosier.
Your eyes of softer blue,
And I have never felt for her
As I have felt for you;
Our love was like the bright snow flakes.
Which melt before you pass,
Or the bubble on the wine, which breaks
Before you lip the glass:
You saw these eyelids wet, Love,
Which she has never seen,
But bid me not forget, Love,
My poor Josephine.

BRIEF MENTION.
Civilization has given the Tasmanian abo-
riginal a happier land I
A bush-missionary who dies and goes to
his reward always turns up on Queen’s birthday
for a new blanket.
Bishop Kennion, of S.A., desires to form
a Social Purity Society in that colony. He will call
it the White Cross society. This will distinguish it
from the other Southern Jam Company, whose
badge, we believe, is a red cross.
Severe country journals devote a column
of space to the alleged discovery of Noah’s Ark.
If our Press is thus unsecularised, we shall shortly 1
find in their columns allusions to the unearthing
of Pharoah’s pride, of Mrs. Potiphar’s virtue, and
of old man Parkes’ aspirated aspirations.
When Charles Bright, in his grave-side
oration over the cold clay of poor old Bowie Wilson
the other day, assured his hearers that on the other
Bide of Jordan men would meet their wives and
wives their husbands, many wept, and asked them-
selves whether divorce was only temporary after
A sagacious Irishman noticed, on last St.
Patrick’s Day, that all the whisky-dealers were on
horseback, while all the whisky-drinkers were on
foot. Had he been loss bigoted by religion, he
would have also noticed that, while the voters and
holy-water sprinklers walked in procession, all the
priests and politicians rode in carriages.
Judge Wilkinson has added to his stock of
white kid gloves through the torpidity of -crime in
ncramatta. One of our most eminent ex-Judges
often whiles away a dreary hour hy contemplating:
the stock of kid gloves received by him during:
circuit. But, in the latter case, the gloves are not
white-coloured, but the reverse. Ail the same,
they are significant, and arouse sweet memories.
A certain eminent Melbourne money-
lender, of shent-per-shent principles, has a largre
mirror on either side of his office-window, and sits
between the two glasses, which have been most
scientifically adjusted by an optical expert. When
any man who owes him money passes by, he sends
his messenger (who otherwise never leaves his
side) to bring the debtor back to the “ surgery.”
New works in the Press :—Bechet: “ Does
it pay to insure?” Peter Campbell: “Is a Boef-

before intelligent jury for pulling a woman’s clothes
up to her knees in presence of four men. Sworn

at the verdict you have arrived at.” Foreman;
“ We thought the whole thing w;is only a lark.”
O yes, such a lark for—the woman!
A Port Darwin dairyman has come out in
his true colours. He keeps chained to his pump
an alligator, seven feet long, and quite capable of
taking a man’s leg off or swallowing-a child. It
got loose the other night and went to the cable
station with the intention of eating the operator,
who was, fortunately, out. However, the residents
like the alligator, so long as he keeps his mouth
shut, far better than they like the dairyman’s milk.
The cow-owner means to put the alligator in the
shafts of the milk-cart shortly, and reckons that,
when the saurian’s properly trained, no one will in
his presence talk about “sky-blue,” “chalk-and-
water,” or pumps.
Jules Joubert was going along George-
street, the other morning, somewhat wrapped up
in himself. The cynical might say that that was a
very thin covering for a man in such cold weather.
But to our story. “ Good heavens, what’s the
matter with you, old follow ?’’ asked a friend.
“Oh,” replied Jules despondingly laying his hand
on his throat as if in agony, “ the old complaint-
enlargement of the annexes.” (A cable had just
arrived notifying that the European exhibitors
would require a great deal of additional space
at Calcutta Exhibition.) “ Yes,” mused the other,
“I have a terrible attack—worse than ever
—enlargement of the annexes.” “Poor old
man; they say that’s fatal, don’t they?” .Piles
vouchsafed no reply, but walked away. His friend
excused him. “ Poor fellow!”
Buzaoott, of Brisbane Courier, is goin" it
as usual. “ A Baby’s Dimple” is his latest subject
for poetry. No competent editor would have
exposed himself to a risk like that. There is
scarcely a compositor living who could resist the
temptation to make it “ A .Baby's Pimple,” and
then send all his mates to hang* round next morning
and hear the editor swear when he got to the office.
Buzzy has escaped this once, but if ho continues
his reckless career he will find himself publishing,
quite unexpectedly, when ho imagined ho had
given out verses on a Shrunken Rose, an ode to a
shrunken Nose, or a Drunken Nose, or a Drunken
Dose, or a Drunkard’s Hose, while titters meet his
ear everytimo he passes the door of the composinir-
room.
A country paper tells how a citizen of
Ararat found, on returning 1 home, that his house
had been eaten by a couple of innocent-looking
cows, while a calf had nearly consumed a pair of
moleskin pants left out to dry by the owner when
—but a short time before—he left for the store
with a jug, his wife being from home. He lived in
a tent. The pole alone remained to show where a
poor but honest son of toll started to raise a family
in the wilderness. The singular part of the affair
is that the calf’s contribution to the general wreck
has been entirely misrepresented. This inability
to grasp the whole facts of a ease is characteristic
of nearly all rival journals. They never state the
matter properly. Either the facts are whittled
down so as to lose all interest, or they are grossly
exaggerated so as to lose all rraisemhlance. Hap
penlng to visit Ararat last week, pure curiosity in-
duced us to enquire Into this affair. Thofollowing
is the result, divested of all the would-be jocoseness
some obscure newspaper hack. It was the cows
that ate the pants as well as the tent. They took
a leg each, and chewed philosophically a wav unit!

Mat 19, 1883.


Victoria, the land of Aaron Waxman, is
the land of promise. Promise to pay shixty per
shent.
In Geelong, Vic., if a constable gossips in
the street he is fined £3. He must simply take the
pie and pass on.
Tuberculosis from cattle. No wonder.
What can the Minister of Mines—a lawyer, possibly
—know about the Stock report ? Now when
Dr. Ren-^—-
The old decree that a man should earn his
living by the sweat of his brow has been considera-
bly improved upon. A Sydney rogue makes 15 per
cent, or so by sweating sovereigns.
Says a recent Lancet: “ Perhaps the most
dangerous of all animal food is the flesh of the
average pig.” Another injustice to the “ jainyil'
Dan, and “ould Oireland."
We read that the senior proprietor of a
Victorian country paper had a row with a man
lately, and “ savagely worried” his thumb. If this
is the style of the senior, we should like to know
what the Junior proprietor Is like. Probably he is
a bulldog.
Mr. Bryce, the N. Z. Native Minister, will
Sroceod with his libel suit against Mr. Rusden, of
’.Z. historical celebrity, “as soon as ever he has
fixed up the Maories.” We shall probably soon
hoar of To Root! being sent on a diplomatic mis-
sion to Melbourne, with a meat-chopper.
A Qundagai butcher once had a native
darkey as a help In the trade, and Jackey, like all
his countrymen, was fond of rum. After a
night’s debauch, he was met early one morning
coming out of town. Being asked “where he was
off to so early ?” ho replied, “ Off to catch it ’pos-
sum.” “ Why, Jackey,’’ remarked his interrogator,
“ you plenty boof at shop.” “ Baal go it this
morning,” said .lackey; “got’em too much rum
hist night—like it something noice.’
“ A Perplexed One, Sydney: We can give
no advice in matters of religious faith. You must
act in accordance with the dictates of your judg-
ment.’’—Shroud.
What I poor journalistic wraith,
Have you, then, no religious faith ?
We thought two gods you ever had—
One, a good paying Gov’ment ad..
The other, prince o’ political sharks,

Four men were recently “docked” for
robbing one David Talbot, at Lancefleld, Vic.
David is excessively short-sighted, and when
asked if he could identify the prisoners as the men
who bailed him up, he electrified the court by
pointing with the greatest confidence to the jury,
and shouting out, “Yes, them’s the gentlemen who
robbed mo.” David had got his ideas of a “jury of
four” muddled up with matters of a somewhat
foreign nature.
A servant girl at Greymouth (N.Z.) bought
a young horse, rode it herself on the racecourse,
and came in an easy winner in the “ladies’ ” hack-
race. Her master and mistress take great pride in
their Abigail's performance, and they have built a
stable for the quadruped's accommodation. The
master is not a sporting man himself, but his stable
and kitchen will be duly represented at future
turf-gatherlngs.
In a certain Southern town reside three of
the groat unpaid. Some time ago, a son of No. 1
assumed the role of defendant at the local temple
of Justice, for a potty misdemeanour: the wife of
No. 2 followed suit shortly after; the trio was
completed last week, when No. 3 himself figured
as law-breaker. The revenue profited by their
misdeeds upon each occasion. Moral: The nearer
the Court the further from ! At the same
Court, an offender was fined only two shiMnys for
stealing some turkeys, while another was awarded
a month’s seclusion for “ prigging ” an old pair of
boots. Ye gods!
Iti view of the coming Yass Pigeon Match,
some Bogolong aspirants tor shooting honours are
going in for practice in rather a novel manner.
They caught an unfortunate magpie some weeks
ago,' and have been using it for practice ever since.
The following is the modus operandi: A fishing-
line is tied to the bird’s leg, and he is placed in a
trap, which is sprung at some fifteen yards rise.
Should the magpie be missed, which he invariably
is, he is hauled back and placed in the trap for the
next shootist. With the exception of the loss of a
few feathers, the bird has up to date escaped
unhurt.
A bloated young Britisher, who bought a
station not long ago, came to the conclusion that
roping and half strangling cattle in the ordinary
way, for the purpose of inoculation, was cruel; he
therefore resolved to administer chloroform. So
bidding his attendants keep at a distance, ho went
into the stock yard to face a stud bull, bearing in
his hand a rag saturated with the drug tied on to a
elothes-prop. Two minutes later he was going in
the direction of the homestead sideways; and since
this, mustering has been stopped on the station, all
hands and the Chinese cook being now exclusively
engaged in operating on the boss with arnica.
Alfred’s poetic-obituary man still sails on
with his dead-mareh jingles. Here is the verse
which the musical mute shakes up to suit every
age and sex :
“ Fairer than the flowers above thee,
Fading on thy still, cold breast,
Placed by gentle hands that loved thee,
Little Lizzie’s gone to rest.”
One day you see this printed aproiws of the deceaseof
Lizzie M’Gillicuddy; the next you find it quoted
in regard to the shuftling-off ot Max Schwlllensau-
fenstein.
The conductors of the S. M. Herald have
had the courage to resent what could not be re-
garded as other than a gratuitous insult to the
Press generally. It is known to everyone that the
Press were not allowed to be present at the Minis-
terial picnic to the Hawkesbury, and now we
make known the fact that reports of the proceed-
ings were prepared by two members of the
Government and handed to the Hkralu for
publication, but the copy was politely declined.
The fear of “dvspeptic’ attacks seems to be driv-
ing ministers and members to unreasonable
extremes. At Mr. Berry’s return dinner on Mon-
day night, more pressman than Postal Conference
delegates wore present.
Captain Byrnes, of the “Parramatta
Prawns,” recently informed the bronzed and
bearded veterans 'under his command, t hat his
breast was filled to the bung with patriotic pride
until it looked like a big balloon that had just
caught on to a brass-button factory, as he learnt
that a gentleman had presented a splendid malacca
stick, to be given to the best drilled man in the
corps, and had asked him to act as judge, and that,
if the winner could make three consecutive centres
at 600 yards, he would have it silver-mounted for
him. D’ye hear that, Sir Garnet Wolseley V When
did you ever tempt your warriors to seek “the
bubble reputation even in Iho cannon's mouth,”
as this fine old Parramatta gentleman has done ?
Carver, the crack shootist, has already entered for
the 600 yards trophy, and Bogardus says he’ll come
over, too, if another patriot can be found to give
the cane a coat of striped paint, and throw in one
of Eastway’s patent rat-traus also. Tar-ran-ta-ra.
We are happy now. No more trouble
about getting cured! Here we see an enterprising
suburbau medical gentleman who tackles asthma,
cancer, and consumption (trifles, perhaps, in them-
selves) with equal confidence. We don’t know
which he is the greatest on; but we should say,
from the illimitable confidence he appears to have
in himself—consumption. The practitioner to
whom we are alluding has Hot gone through the
form of putting his name upon the medical regis-
try; but this is mere detail. He states in a volu-
minous ad. in a country paper that during the past
ten years he has attended Benefit Societies repre-
senting upwards of 1500 persons, and during that
period only two have been sick (and that for a week
only), and not one has died! This is the doctor we
have been whistling for for years, and we are now
hesitating whether we will go to him ourselves or
emd our dog. Do you see that luck is variable?
This medical person has had, apparently, a run of
it for ten years; and it is time it ought to change.
On consideration, we think we will send our dog.
At Ballarat one Ah Chung (probably ol
Eastern origin) observed a box on nis counter. He
had not placed it there, so with the delightful
curiosity (it is a grogs calumny to Suppose that
women have a monopoly of this winning character-
istic) of his sex and nation,he opened it. It contained
dynamite caps. Even then nis curiosity was not
satisfied, so ne took one to learn what could be
learnt of it, without an instructor, but with a
hammer. He is now acquainted with the properties
of fulminating mercury. He is also a thumb and
three fingers short. His digits were short enough
before, but they are shorter now—at least in
number. Besides the unsightliness inseparable
from truncated members, his performances on the
“tom-tom” are somewhat interfered with, as the
artistic shake on which so much depends in
Oriental music has to be skipped or imperfectly
rendered. The peculiarities of nitro-glycerine and
its half-brother dynamite are now so well under-
stood that it is not easy to see what additional light
Ah Chung expected to throw on the matter by
actual experiment. One thing, however, is certain.
The confiding nature of this child of the Sun has
undergone such a radical change, and his desire to
study the fitness of things has received such an
emphatic rebuff, that the poultry helonginglto his
barbarian neighbours are suffered to attain a
1 mgevity and development to which they were
formerly strangers.
Mr Wright is right. Our tramway system
is a perfect farce—ln that, for one thing, our trams
“ don’t pay.” That is to say, they don’t pay in the
hands of Government A private company—our
Omnibus Company, say—would make thousands
out of them. Here is a clip from the diary of a
man at Randwick: —“ Friday, 4th May—Took tram
6 p.m. from Sydney. Spring of motor broke;
passengers walked from sheds to Randwick and
Coogee. To make up for this, the 6.20 tram ran
into broken motor. Mr. Pokorney pelted his
head half way through my lungs, and I left four
of my best teeth in Mrs. M’Googarty’s windpipe.
11.15 tram stopped at racecourse gates, and Rand-
wick residents were then permitted to get out and
either walk home or go to the devil, just as they
thought proper. Saturday sth—Line clear, but
trams running on the go-as-you-please system.
Bicycle races at Association Grounds the cause.
(P.B.—A bicycle is a trotting-sulky wheel with a
three “ha’penny” dip at the bottom, and a two-
legged fool on top of it.) Sunday, 6th—lane
blocked for a time. Passengers packed ala tinned
sardines, only more so. Monday, 7th—Motor off
line. 11.15 tram kept an hour at Moore Park, just
to enable visitors to fully enjoy the scenery.
Tuesday, Bth—Trams running punctually. Several
residents dropped dead from fright in consequence.
Wednesday, 9th—Motor off line. Public confidence
once more restored. Thursday, 10th —Motor off
line at Coogee. No tram from Sydney between
11.30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Ordered roast turkey for to-
day’s dinner, and got home just in time to see the
afternoon milkman’s dog putting himself outside
of the last scrap—the “Pope’s nose,” my favourite
morsel. Friday, 11th—Motor off Moore Park line
at noon. Several good Catholics began to curse, as
this was a special fish day. Saturday, 12th—Being
pressed for time, walked in and out, and thought
sorrowfully of several things.”
A recent D. T. reports what it calls “a
painful case.” A gentleman named Francis
Trimble stole two concertinas from Harris and
Ackman’s, and got fourteen days for itr—just one
week, in fact, for each concertina. It is only a
man with a finely musical mind, who could have
any sympathy with a rascal who steals concertinas.
We have never been finely musicall n a concertina
sense, so are comparatively callous. Mr. Ackman
stated, in his evidence, that “about 1 p.m. on
' Saturday, whilst he was in his sale-rooms, his
attention was directed to prisoner as being a thief
of the concertinas.” If this be the case, Mr.
Trimble must have long been a very “ painful case”
in his own right-of-way! We reported, in an
aerial manner, some numbers ago, the case of a
woman stealing a pair of bagpipes. With her,
even if she did steal them, we can find some slight
sympathy. Because she couldn’t, you see, have
stolen them to play them. Nobody but a profes-
sional piper could find any pleasure in doing aught
with bagpipes except burning them, or making a
butter-churn out of the bladder. Any woman, as
a matter of fact, who either steals a set of bag-
pipes or kills a piper is entitled not only to sym-
pathy, but (we consider, on reflection) to a fire-
man’s medal or a statue. The distinction between
a bagpipe filcher and a concertina sneak
is thus made obvious. A man who will
play a concertina knowingly—much less steal
one —merits, to our mind, not 14 days, but
14,000. First amongst instruments of torture on
this earth ranks the dental forceps, next the
accordion, and then the concertina. It may be not
generally known, but it is an historical tact [Only
tremblingly endorsed by us—Eu. B.] that when the
rack, “Little Ease,” “the Scavenger’s Daughter,”
and the thu mbscrcw were abolished in the Tower of
London, the Introduction of the concertina im-
mediately followed. It is rumoured that when
Queen Mary wished to tire Lady Jane Grey of life,
she got Rriiard, the Spanish ambassador, to play
“ Mollie Darling ” continually on that instrument
outside the Traitors’ Gate, near which ominous
entrance Jane was located. After two days of this,
the Queen of ten days sent round saying that all she
yearned for was the block. She got the block,
and concertinas triumphed. We wonder, by-the-
way, who introduced concertinas into the colony ?
But, whoever it was, we don’t recommend the man
to be confidential. None but the clergy now-a-
days are safe from our little hatchet. We mean
nobody connected however distantly with
musical instruments, either wind or otherwise,
especially otherwise.

Nearly 100,000,000 gallons of wine were made in
France last year from raisins Two Michigan
teamsters quarrelled; one stole up to his adversary
from the rear and chopped his head clean off. The
murderer was hustled out of the drinking saloon
and lynched hard by. His mates came to rescue
him, and, a general scrimmage ensuing, seven men
were shot The Montana (U.S.) people five times
half-hanged a murderer to make him confess.
However, he escaped, got frost-bitten and had his
feet amputated. He was tried and found guilty,
but, thinking that he would not be hanged by the
authorities, a number of masked men rushed the
gaol, went to the doomed man’s cell, tied his
hands, and hanged him over an iron railing

ARNOLD’S BALSAM OF HOREHOUND.
Nothing so quickly cures Coughs, Whooping
Cough, Bronchitis, Asthma, Loss of Voice, In-
fluenza, Hoarseness and Weak Chest, as this
Balsam. Excellent for children. Very safe and
reliable in Croup. This is the best expectorant
now in use, relieves by dissolving the congealed
phlegm. A single dose quietens and gives relief:
a small bottle often cures. Ask for “Arnold's”
and get it; spurious imitations are sometimes
offered.
The Town Clerk of the city is to be “ Wool-
cotted ” by the gentle Dan. O’Connor. Dan’s bill to
improve the character of the Corporation by
leaving the selection of aldermen principally to
Eeople who would be more likely to be influenced
y free grog than any other consideration is the
cause of the trouble. Speaking on the day of the
prorogation of Parliament, respecting the uncere-
monious treatment of the Bill in the Upper House,
Dan said: “He felt very much annoyed at the loss
of the bill, more particularly as he knew that a man
who was in the service of the citizens had in a most
foul manner told deliberate falsehoods to Mr.
Darley to prevent the bill being passed. This was
the Town Clerk! [Mr. Trickett: A first-class
officer.] A first-class conspirator who made wilful
and malicious representations to Mr. Darley ! A
parasite who had lived on the citizens for years,
and who had misused his position over and over
again! A first-class officer who overlooked mal-
practices in connection with the Corporation ! He
would bring the conduct of this officer under the
notice of the citizens on an early date.” Dan was
very irate, and Mr. Trickett’s interjection seemed
to make him more bitter, as he went on to accuse
that member of having induced another member
to oppose the bill, although he did not do so
openly himself. The Piddingtonian indignantly
denied the imputation, and gave a bitter pill to
Dan—“ I am never afraid to state my opinions.
There is no skulking behind the scenes with me.”
Dan had not time to retort before “Black Kod”
made his appearance, and desired the wranglers to
go to the other House to hear the Governor trill
his “pr-r-r-ayer that the blessings of Divine
Pr-r—r-ovidence” might be extended to members
during the period when they would not be sacrific-
ing their time for “ the good of the country.”
The only thing left for Wiggins now.

[For the Bulletin.]
Twenty-two,
Debonair,
Crispbrown hair.
Eyes so blue,
Tnat the'sky
Flashes through,
Though night is there.
And the bare
Warehouse wall
Behind her rings.
Echoing sweet
Wafts of tone
As with all
She laughs and sings—
So musical
Her voice, the stone
Must repeat
And allure
Passengers,
Who else had shunn’d her,
To stay and wonder
How even such pure
Sounding chimes are hers—
The meaning she utters
Being foul as the slime in the gutters.
Twenty-two—
Walking the street
With aching feet,—
And Oh ! my sisters, the heart of you
Could you but know what she must do
For bread to eat!
Twenty-two,
Yet worn and old,
Yet young and fair ;
Her smile has told
Her wan despair ;
Her jests arise
To emphasise ,
How Life is lies !
If hers is Life—
If hers is living
Worth taking or giving—
Where is the knife
Which cuts more keenly
Than thus to be as she never should—
To have beggar’d her queenly
Womanhood ?
Naught is here,
Naught that stirs
Of her own in her own—
Any have known
Who chose to pay—
Any may know—
That is her way—
We made her so.
Twenty-two—
And none may restore her !
With That before her
She durst not view.
Twenty-two—
Hopes softly coo
Life’s lovely crown ;
Twenty-two,
And on the Town !
No wayward blasts of Passion
Can she claim;
She may be a fashion—
Be a name ;
But changeless as the light
.Eons old,
Aions told,
Since Time was Time—
Whose ever be the blame,
Whatever be her crime.
Whatever be her shame.
She is the same !
She cries through day and night,
A vibrate, burning flame :
“ I fill the greed of Humanity ;
I am the deed of Humanity ;
I am the seed of Humanity ;
I am the need of Humanity ;
For I am human—
For I am woman—
Nothing but brute
Through and through—
Prostitute—
Twenty-two.”

DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
A Wesleyan minister in Sydney standing
up for Roman Catholic dogma, and a Roman
Catholic clergyman in Lithgow taking part in a
Wesleyan tea-meeting. What next? The mil-
lenium!
Mr. Charles Bright’s speech at Bowie Wil-
son’s grave contained a good deal of what he
strongly condemned in others—dogma. Charles’
dogma was his reference to the future state. Poor
old Bowie, he said, was hovering about in the air-
taking a deep interest in the proceedings. Now,
what does Mr. Bright know, more than any other
priest, of the land beyond the grave ?
We hate the devil and all his works and
the world with all its pomps of course, but what
we hate most of all is to find Hunter-street
“stamp-pickers” setting up, at 5 a.m. on the
lovely Sawbath morn, hali-a-mile of a sulphur
and brimstone article on the crying necessity
for the strict observance of the first day of the
week.
The priest of St. Lorenzo Church, at Rome,
lately caused a placard to be affixed at the entrance
of the church announcing a sermon for sinful
journalists, their wives, or children. The editor of
the Fanfuela thanked the reverend gentleman in
a very funny article for his particular attention to
journalists, but at the same time expressed his re-
gret at being prevented from attending, having an
invitation to an oyster-dinner on the same
day. In consequence of this reply, the parson as-
sured his congregation in his sermon that the devil
had invented an ingeniously constructed “tor-
menting roast-jack” in order to grill journalists
in everlasting fire.
It will be remembered bow the prim old
maid who presided over a young ladles* academy
caused even the most hardened offenders to toe
the line supplicatingly, when, on the appearance
of insubordinate symptoms among the girls, she
threatened to “ call in the military.” So with us,
when an effort is made to upset some of the obser-
vances by which the Puritans—bless them!—suc-
ceeded in making the first day of the week a day
of gloom and depression, we are met at the very
threshold with the cries of “ Sabbath desecration,”
and “Continental Sunday.” For years people on
the Murray have been endeavouring to throw
open their libraries and museums to those who
must visit them on Sundays or not at all, but pre-
Judice has hitherto been too strong for them.
Sven Sydney folks are ever so much before the
Melbournites in this matter. Persuasion, irony,
laughter, have been tried at Melbourne in vain.
Reason and satire have alike failed to pierce
the dense wall of bigotry and superstition con-
fronting them. As Darwin despaired of winning
to his side middle-aged and elderly naturalists, but
looked to the young men for an acceptance, or,
rather, a fair consideration of his theory, so
Liberals in Victoria have to look forward to a new
feneration of divines before the principles they
ave at heart can hope to make headway. Before
they cease to be a laughing-stock to foreigners for
their inspired stupidity in passing Sunday as they
do, it will be necessary to have a few hundred
respectable funerals. Any time during the last
few years the proposal to open the museums
and art galleries on the first day of the
week has been on the carpet. The committee hav-
ing at last decided to try the experiment, the
inevitable white “chokers” close their ranks and
bawl “no thoroughfare.” The Dean of Melbourne
is to the “fore” as usual. It will be curious to
hear his answer on the great settling day up aloft
when the recording angel asks him why, with the
twentieth century almost on the horizon, he con-
demned John Smith to swelter the whole long
broiling summer’s day in the dens of Little Bourke-
street, and Jack Brown to booze in the filthy par-
lour of a Collingwood “shebeen,” because he
would not let them “desecrate” the Sabbath by
riding out to see the green fields round Sunbury,
or by loitering before the pictures they helped to
pay for. Of what avail in that supreme moment
will be the babble of “ Continental Sunday,” or,
“Sabbath desecration,” to those who helped to
brutalise their less fortunate brothers by denying
them the means by which their rugged natures
might have been reached and softened ?

Trouble at St. Mark’s, Darling Point.
The reverend “ vicar ” and the assthetic curate are
just now not on terms—The sittings in the C.
and E. edifice in a flourishing coast town in this
colony are 3s. for front seats, 3s. 6d. for the back,
per quarter. Its needless to say which section is
the more patronised....The Victorian Banner
says a dancing master can more readily than a
minister get the use of State schools 36 tons of
rabbits forwarded from Colac to Melbourne
recently.... Rev. B. C. Spicer and Charles Bright
debate on “Genesis v. Science” at the Protestant
Hall, May 32 and 23... .The members of the Single-
ton Mechanics’ Institute have decided against
Sunday opening by 34 votes to 14.... Rev. E. J.
Luckie, another old R. C. priest, is dead. In a few
years there will hardly be a N.S.W. clergyman in
receipt of State aid. The deaths of the Revs. Luckie
and Quirk gives back to the State about £BOO a
year.

A Montreal clergyman seeking to discover
why his church had not been swept and dusted,

died of starvation Joseph Cook has not made up
his mind at what precise moment the soul quits the
body. We can tell Joseph the precise moment when
his soul quitted his body. It was exactly the mo-
ment he was born ... In Londonderry a magistrate
took a freak to seize all the Sunday newspapers,
under some old Sunday desecration law still un-
repealed. He, however, got a reprimand from Mr.
Trevelyan, Secretary for Ireland.... There was a
free fight in a church in England a little while ago,
between the High Church party and the Low
Church party, and a large body (numbering over
50) of police had to be called in to quell it. This is
the pious method of Sunday amusement. Free-
thinkers prefer picnics... .Texas Legislature has !

POLITICAL POINTS.
The Affirmation Bill has been rejected by a
narrow (literally a narrow) majority in the House
of Commons. Is a Briton’s word so brittle that it
cannot be relied on unless fortified by an appeal
to the Almighty ?
Buchanan did his Buchananest to strangle,
on technical grounds, the resolution affirming the
desirableness of the issue of free railway-passes to
school children. The inference is that a resolution
abrogating the right of barristers to travel free on
circuit would be of equal technical invalidity in
Buchanan’s eyes.
Mr. Wisdom, the ex-A.-G., said in the
Assembly, recently, of the Colonial Treasurer, who
interruped his speech with an interpolated and
logical “ nut-to-crack ” :—“ The Colonial Trea-
surer’s forte is interruption. His disorderliness is
so great that if by any stray chance he gets to
heaven, he will create a mutiny among the Arch-
angels.” Is this wit, or is it Wisdom ?
Ever since the Minister for Public Instruc-
tion dubbed M’Elhone a “ psychological phenome-
non,” the Upper Hunter “bruiser*’ has been so
increasingly enraptured with the density and
destructiveness of the phrase that he has included
it in his magazine of verbal explosives and nitro-
genous adjectives, even at the risk of displacing
such other combustible compositional compounds
as “sanguinary sot” and “shovel-faced swiper.”
Why was the Assembly listening to Dan
O’Connor moaning alone the rejection of his little
Bill like a recent audience at the Theatre Royal ?
Because the House was entertained with the
spectacle of a Roman awry. This Joke would take
tne prize anywhere—for lameness. It is supposed
to have been concocted by Parkes before he sought
the seclusion which Faulconbridge grants to him in
whose heart shoddy loyalty pants.
The Upper House shelved Earnshaw’s
Estate Bill because sufficient information had not
been given respecting it. We want some informa-
tion other than that which is desired by the old
gentlemen who view with alarm the numerous
appeals made to Parliament to alter the terms of
wills. Was the Bill introduced in the Assem-
bly by a member of Parliament who belongs
to the legal profession ! Was it drafted and
and the preliminaries arranged by that member’s
firm? What was their bill of costs. £2OO, or less?
Was the amount credited to the firm collectively?
Was any portion of the amount for “ attendance
before select committee?”
On March 25, in Paris, Mr. Parnell was
interviewed by a correspondent of the Vienna
Phesse. He declared that three out of the ten
men recently executed in Ireland were now known
to have been entirely innocent of the crimes laid at
The spread of the blessing of civilization
among the heathen in New Zealand is proceeding
at a great pace. The native Land Courts illustrate
what these blessings consist of. Chief Judge Mac-
donald compared all concerned with his Court
with the jockeys, blacklegs, and gamblers who
crowd about a racecourse. The Judge said : “It I
am to believe all that is poured into my ears pri-
vately, there is not one amongst us engaged in this
Court who, by virtue of his conduct, is not fit for a
gaol or lunatic asylum.” Commenting on this the
N.Z. Herald says: “For years past such stories as
he alludes to have been current. In almost every
important case it has been alleged that the assessor
had been bought by one of the parties, and the
precise sum paid was generally added; that Mr.
(one of the lawyers in the case) had got Mr.
- (one of the pakeha-Maoris or interpreters in
the case) to make Te So-and-so drunk, and thus
keep him out of the Court at a critical time; that
had “ sold ” those who depended upon him,
having been seduced to do so by a Maori Delilah;
that one set of European purchasers had bought
the agents of the opposite side, who were selling
their clients. If reports were to be believed, every-
body concerned was lit for gaol. We must say
that our candid opinion is that a few years’ dealing
in native lands would corrupt the most upright
man in New Zealand, in whatever capacity he
might be engaged.” What a comforting thought
it is that we have in N.S. Wales some men whom
even a N.Z. Land Court would not corrupt! We
have Parliamentary land-agents whom even that
would not corrupt—more.
Mr. M'Elhone made a long speech ou the
question of the issue of free railway passes to
children attending schools, his object evidently
being to make himself right for a passport to
heaven, as must be apparent from these extracts:
—“ I bow to no man in God’s creation, be he Arch-
bishop Vaughan, Pope Peter, or Sir Henry Parkes;
I care as much for Archbishop Vaughan or the
Pope as the honorable member for Tenterfield
does. I care no more for them than I do for the
poorest blackfellow in the country. The fact of
the existence of the Pope or the Archbishop does
not deter me from fearlessly expressing my
opinion. ... I believe that religion is a sham,
a fraud, and a curse to humanity. Priests and
parsons who go about professing to have the love
of God in their hearts are often animated by the
spirit of the devil; they delight in trading on the
worst feelings of humanity; while they have the
word of God in their mouths they have the devil
in their hearts, and from their pulpits they sow
seeds of discord, not caring two straws what the
consequences may be. . . . We must all come
to the end to which 1 referred (death), and if we are
to believe the priests and parsons, when that time
comes every little thought which we ever had will
be revealed, and God knows what will become of
us then. Our sins will be recorded on a huge
black-board in bright colours to our dismay, and 1
suppose that the majority of us will cut a very
sorry figure there.” What will the priests and
their faithful followers say to this “My opinion
is that if the father or mother cannot teach the
children religion the schoolmaster cannot, and the
priests and parsons will not because they have too
much to do—all that they care about is getting as
much pay as possible—worming as much money out
of the children as they can.” Tom Slattery attacked
M'Elhone for making such a speech,remarking that
it was cheap liberality to come before the As-
sembly and the country and to hold up the head of
your church to ridicule.” M‘Elhone : He is not
the head of my church !” Mr. Slattery : The hon-
orable _ member belongs to the same church as
Archbishop Vaughan, and he acknowledges him
to be the head ot the Roman Catholic Church in
this country.” Mr. M'Elhone: “I never did so.
I never acknowledged any tyrant to be my master.
* * *
The dual desertions —The Patriotic Brothers
have fled from Armagh, and M'Elhone has seceded
from the Ministerial ranks. But Armagh is none
the less Armaghed, and Stuart is still Premier, the
preceding desei’tions to the contrary notwithstand-
ing. .. . The Cook (N.Q.) electorate is in a deplorable
condition. John Walsh, one of its Parliamentary
representatives, has for years kept a store at
Wagga, N.S.W., and won’t resign; the other mem-
ber, J. A. Cooper, who is identical with the gor-
geous personage who the other day married a Vic-
torian heiress, has never set foot on the Palmer
except when passing through Byerstown on his way
to the Hodgkinson nearly six years ago. The pair
simply poke fun at their constituents.

The food supplied to Carey is regularly
examined, to guard against poison During 1883
there were 5301 families evicted in Ireland, com-
prising 36,836 persons. The evident mystification
of the police as to the identity of Number One be-
gins to give rise to the impression that no such
being ever existed outside of James Carey’s inven-
tion .... Since Lady Florence Dixie’s last escapade,
people have been taking a retrospective view oi
her various published statements and proceedings.
Discredit is now thrown on much that she has
alleged respecting her Irish dealings, and it is
asserted that whue acting as newspaper corres-
pondent in Zululand she forged a letter purport-
ing to be written by King Cetewayo... The Mor-
mons have been holding indignation meetings
against the Fenians; and at Milwaukee, which is
chiefly inhabited by Scandinavians, the people had
enough of Pigeon-English and bigotry to petition

Parker, the Grammar School flyer, con-
siderably surprised the oldsters on Saturday by his
performance in his fancy distance, 440 yards. It is
quite evident that he is a match for any amateur

Arsenic-eating has in the old world become
increasingly common. Women eat it in two
forms: the white powders, or arsenious acid, as
the drug dealers have it, and Fowler’s solution,
which the pharmacopoeia says is a mixture of
arsenic with potash in a fluid form. Either way of
taking arsenic causes plumpness of face and
beauty of complexion. Its influence is principally
on the capillary surface of the skin, which pro-
duces the plumpness. In plain English, water is
the influence at work, and in the end it shows
itself. The skin assumes a watery transparency,
which in its turn gives way to ghastliness and
whitening of the lips. This is the awakening from
the blissful dream. Beauty vanishes and the end
comes. A very few years of periodicaldosing-pntTr
the vain one in her grave.

McGillviray’s Dream.
A FOREST RANGER’S STORY.
[For the Bulletin.]
Just nineteen long years, Jack, have passed o er my
shoulders ~, .. „
Since, close to this spot, we lay waiting the foe;
Aye, here is the mound where brave Percivai
moulders, . „ ..
And yonder’s the place where poor Norman lies
low.
’Twas only a skirmishjust eight of our number
Were stretched on the sward when the fighting
was done; „ , ~
We scoop’d out their beds and we left them to
slumber— , . ... ~
The bold-hearted fellows went down with the
sun.
The month was October—young Summer was peep-
Througfi ever-green forests, where Spring, still
supreme, , , ~ ,
Spread all the rich tints that she had in her keep-
jng
On tree, shrub, and bush, while each brooklet
and stream ..
With babblings of joy ran along to the nver—
But, hang it, old man, I am going too far;
I talk as I used to, when from Cupid’s quiver
Flew darts of affection, my bosom to scar.
I’m not much at poetry, Jack, though I’ve written
Some nonsense in verse when my heart was aglow
With what they call love—have you ever been
smitten , . .
By some artful minx, who deceived you ? What.
No!
By Jove I you’ve been lucky; but, Jack, Im
digressing; , _ ,
Our quarters were here, under Tusk, and we
made , _ . _. .
Our camp in the Church, without asking a blessing:
This place is still known as the Manku Stockade*
I’d fought with Von Tempsky along the Waikato,
I’d seen the green banks of that fair river dyed
With British blood—red as the plumes of the rata
When Spring scatters scarlet drops thick in her
pride. _
I cared not for danger, and fighting’ was pleasure;
The life of a Banger was one of romance—
A dare-devil fool, ever ready to measure
A savage’s length with my rifle. Twas chance
That sent me amongst them: Hived but for glory—
My comrades were all of good metal and true,
And one was a hero; I’U tell you his story—
God rest poor M’Gillviray, brave-hearted Hugh!
I knew him for years, Jack, and shoulder to
shoulder
He’d stood by me often when swift leaden hail
Whizz’d close to our ears—Ah I old man, I was
bolder
In those valiant days than I’m now. To my
The morning was gloomy, and Hugh sat beside me.
We’d chumm’d in together for two years or
more;
1 found him a brick, and ho said when he tried me
In front of the foe, “Bill, you’re true to the
core!” , . ,
Enough, we were friends, and in trouble or danger
We stuck by each other in camp and in fray.
How often w‘o find in the breast of a stranger
The heart of a kind brother throbbing away
With warmest affection, responsive and tender!
Hugh’s breast had a tenant like this, and I knew
In him I’d a brother, a friend, a defender,
Prepared for whatever a brave man might do.
The morning was dark and the outlook was dreary,
I noticed my comrade was sitting alone
All thoughtful, disconsolate, pallid and weary :
“Why, where has the gladness of yesterday flown ?
Come tell me, Hugh, why you are gloomy this
morning ? ~ , , ,
What change has come over my light-hearted
mate? ... . _
You’ve not,”—and I laugh'd—” had a Banshee s
death-warning—
Have Brownies or Goblins been sealing your
fate ? ”
He turned his pale face, while his eyes full of
sorrow
Met mine, and it seemed like the gaze of the
dead.
I spoke once again“ Hugh, we’ll meet them to-
morrow.
Fierce Rewi is coming this way; then he said—
“ Why am I sad ? Ah ! comrade kind.
We cannot tell why shadows fall
Across the soul and o’er the mind:
We cannot tell why dreams recall
Old scenes endear’d by mem’ry’s spell,
Old haunts where love and sorrow met,
Old spots where airy castles fell,
And Hope’s young sun for ever set;
We cannot tell why thought should leap
Across the ocean’s wide expanse,
And through the telescope of sleep
Review the dead years at a glance;
We cannot tell—but why should I
Philosophise ? We know we’re here,
And for the wherefore and the why,
That problem suits the sage and seer,
But not the soldier. Listen’mate,—
I’m not a coward, for I’ve stood
Full face to face with death, and fate
Has led me safe through scenes of blood ;
But now my hour is drawing nigh,
Life’s battle now is nearly done;
For me to-morrow’s arching sky
Shall canopy no rising sun.”
“ Why, comrade, you but jest,” I said;
“You shouldn’t joke with me, you know,
To-morrow’s sun shall shine o’er-head.
And see us watching for the foe.”
“ Nay, comrade, we must part to-day—
A form has beckoned through the gloom.
And signall’d me away, away
To other realms beyond the tomb.
You smile, and count me as a slave
Of superstition ! Be it so:
My vision stretches o’er the grave—
I travel where you cannot go.
Ah! friend, you were not nursed beneath
The Highland hills, where every glen
Is filled with those who’ve conquered death—
Is tenanted with ghosts of men:
Ah! friend, your feet have never trod
The mighty Bens whose summits grim
Approach the starry gates of God—
Where heav’n grows bright and earth gets dim.
The legendary lore that chugs
Round Highland hearts, you have not felt.
Nor yet the weird imaginings
Which stir the spirit of the Celt.
Well, hear my story—listen, pray,
And I’ll explain why I am sad.
And in a down-cast mood to-day,—
You smile again, and deem me mad.
Ijast night I was again a boy
Light-hearted ’mong my native hills.
Fill’d with a bright ecstatic joy,
And pure as my own mountain rills.
1 stood beneath old Monagh Leaght
Not far from rugged Dunnaglass,
And in the distance I could see
Wild Farracagh’s romantic Pass.
A monarch proud, a youthful king,
Alone with nature there I stood;
Atpeace with God and everything,
For ail His works seemed fair and good;
But best and fairest of them all
Was she who came to meet me there—
I little thought dreams could recall
Those silken waves of sunny hair.
That tender smile, those eyes of blue,
The magic of whose flashing glance
Inflamed my,soul with love, and threw
A glamour round me—joyous trance!
We met last night, just as of old,
And Elsie nestled by my side—
While playing with each tress of gold
I whisper’d: “ Lassie, be my bride.”
The sweet soft answer came;— why dwell
On that dear moment of delight,
Our heaven was in that Highland dell
Where ail seemed beautiful and bright.
Y?e parted, and my dreaming soul
On fancy’s pinions forward flew
O’er five short years, and reached the goal
That love and hope had kept in view.
Oh loyous day! a merry throng
Were gathered on the Clachan green,
The villagers, with dance and song,
Held jubilee—that happy scene
Is treasured in my memory still;
I hold again that little hand,
I hear the whispered word “ I will!”
I lead her through that cheerful band,
While Donald Beg,* and Fergus Mohr,t
And Angus Dhu,j the pipers three,
Strike up, while marching on before.
The slogan of McGillviray.
Oh! how the wild notes brought a flood
Of mem’ries bright and glories gone.
When, for the Royal Stuart blood,
Our chief led great Clan Chattan§ on
To famed Culloden’s field!—’Tis past.
That marriage scene with all its charms.
And Winter comes, with freezing blast.
To find my young wife in my arms;
And all the villagers, in tears,
Assembled round us. She was gone!
The prize was mine a few short years,
And I was now alone, alone.
Oh! what had Ito live for then ?
One clnsp, one look, one fond caress.
And Ilyin* far from each proud Ben,
With sorrow deep as dark Loch Ness,
I left my humble Highland home.
To gaze on Monagh Leagh no more:
With blighted heart I crossed the foam,
And landed on New Zealand’s shore,
You know the rest.”
“ But what has all
This home-sick dreaming got to do
With death, my friend
“ I’ve got a call
To meet my Elsie.” „ .
“Nonsense, Hugh!
I laughed, but still his brow was sad:
“ Cheer up, and chase this gloom away,
There’s pleasure yet in life, my lad. ’
“ I tell you we must part to day:
I have not told you all that passed
Before me in my dreaming hours;
This day, with you, shall be my last.
True friendship, Bill, has long been ours,
And we must part in love, my friend.
You smile again—well, time will prove
Mv premonition true: the end
Is drawing nigh; Behold my love,
My life, my Elsie, on yon hill—
Ay, yonder hill is Monagh Leagh.
Just listen, friend, she’s calling still,
And still the dear one beckons me
Away; the sun upon the peaks
Is blushing crimson o’er the snow,
Behold how bright its rays and streaks
Are dancing on Loch Ness beloAV.
Elch violet and purple clouds
A tabernacle form on high.
Behind whose folds the starry crowds
Lie hidden in the silent sky;
’Tis there, ’tis there! the same fond face
Which, but a tew short hours ago,
Press’d close to mine; just in this place
My Elsie stood, and bending low
She whispered, in an icy breath,
“Oh IHugh, behold thy spirit-bxide!
I’m here for thee—prepare for death;
Thy soul to-morrow, by my side,
Shall trace the scenes we loved of yore;
Again, my Hugh, my husband brave.
We’ll watch the Highland eagle soar.
We’ll see the heath and bracken wave.
Ah, Hugh! the spirit sight is keen;
We cross the ocean with a glance—
We know not time.” She left the scene
And I awakened from my trance.
But let us change the subject, mate;
Let’s have a smoke. Hark! there’s a shot—
One, two, three, four! we mustn’t wait.
Where are our rifles ? Ah! we’ve got!
The darkies now. See, see, they dance
Before our eyes ! Hear how they yell!
There goes the order for advance—
There’s Norman out and Percival.”
M’Gillviray ceased, and we ran to the door.
Prepared to advance where our officers led;
Both Hill and O’Beirne were well to the fore.
While Norman and Percival rush’d on ahead.
Flash ! flash ! went our rifles, we followed their
track,
And in through a gap in the timber we broke;
We fired again and they answered us back—
The rebels I mean—as they plunged through the
smoke.
“ Now, back to the camp, lads, we’ve scattered the
swine—
They’ve tasted enough of our metal to-day I ”
’Twas Percival spoke, and we fell into line.
And back through the break in the bush took our
way;
We reached but the centre, when out from the
bush
That skirted each side with its branches and logs,
The Maories in crowds, with a yell and a rush.
Encompassed us—“ Boys, give the treacherous
dogs
A taste ot our true British pluck! ” A wild cry,
As a tomahawk’s stroke cut the sentence in twain,
Went in through the woodlands and up to the sky,
And Percival lay in the front of the slain.
Oh God! in my ears still rings yell after yell—
I see the bright tomahawks dripping with blood,
The wild demons looked as if painted in hell.
They leaped through the thicket and burst from
the wood.
Out-flanked and out-numbered, our officers dead—
A handful of men in the grasp of the foe—
What could we have done in such stress? so we fled
When Norman and Wheeler and Hill were laid
low.
We reached the old church, but the savages stay’d
To butcher the wounded and mangle the slain.
They vanished ere night in the forest’s dark shade.
To steer their canoes o’er Waikato again.
At day-break we went to the scene of the fray
To bury our comrades and bid them adieu!
And near a small mound where five savages lay,
We found brave M’Gillviray sleeping there, too.
Five warrior chiefs proved the work he had done—
They fell by his band ere his soul went to God;
He smiled in the face of the bright morning sun
That shone on the purple streaks o’er the green
sod.
I planted a wattle to mark where he sleeps—
I wonder where is it ? Ah, there stands the tree!
By Jove, it’s in blossom, too ! Bee how it weens
Kich tears of bright gold o’er the hillock where he
Ig resting in pence. Is he dreaming there still
Of Elsie, his bride, and his dear Highland glen ?
This life is a puzzle, Jack, fight as we will;
We’re nothing at last but the shadows of men.
The substance soqn blends with the blossoms and
weeds
That spring to the surface: and as for the soul,
Perhaps it may flourish or fade in its deeds,
Perhaps, when it leaves us, ’tis lost In the Whole.
Welling ton, A .Z.

Miller v. Foley May
SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
The University Football Club, which has
Borne fine raw-boned recruits, promises to be the
strongest this season.
The various competitors for the Krug con-
test, which takes place on the Parramatta course
in June next, are steadily preparing tor the tray.
George Perkins, the English sculler who
has gone back to row for the Doggett coat
and badge, threatens to return after a year to Aus-
tralia.
The Victoria R.C. announce no less than
£14,135 for added money during the coming season.
When, moreover, it is considered how greatly this
lump sum will be increased by sweepstakes, then
does it really seem that the turf of Australia is
becoming an El Dorado for horse-owners.
W. S. Hazelton, the champion bicyclist of
Victoria, has competed in 41 races, winning 33 first
prizes, eight second, and six thirds. At the M.B.C.
sports, in the mile race, he did the fastest time in
the world, beating even Dr. Cortis, the English
amateur’s, record. So says a Melbourne contem-
porary.
The wrestling match, Miller v. Blackburn
comes off on 33rd June, at a place yet to be decided
on. Both men have excellent records—Blackburn
in England and Miller in America. The former is
said to have stood up for five hours against the
champion of England, and to have finally made a
draw of it.
The forthcoming contest for the Krug Cup
Is likely to bring a fine field together. We are glad
to see Mr. Fittes, of Victoria, intends going for it.
Mr. Sharland, we hear, is in great form, and means
to show well up. As for our own men, Brett is
very confident. He and Gaden should decently
represent this colony.
Hazael, the little Englishman who defeated
O’Leary at New York, accomplishing 600 miles,
has arrived in New York, where he intends to
open a pub. He is still prepared to run any man
in the world 10 or 100 miles. He says he is well off,
and in good health. By the way, O’Leary is under-
stood to assert that his defeat in his late match
with Edwards was caused by his having been
drugged.
Says the Spirit of the Times “ The
victories of Hanlan in England have had the effect
of giving British and Australian oarsmen so severe
a set back, that the production of even second-
rate scullers among Britain’s vaunted stalwarts
seems to have been checked. As George Lee’s ex-
perience proves, our oarnsmen of repute can no
longer find a competitor in England.” Acccordmg
to this there should now be a fine field in England
for our coming professionals.
Seven members of the Melbourne Bicycle
Club started on the 39th ultimo, from the Eastern
Hill, at 6 a.m., with the intention of putting away
100 miles in 13 hours ; but, accordng to their state-
ment, they were compelled to return, “ owing to the
fresh breeze,” after doing 14 miles—the first 10 of
which they completed under the hour.. We want
to know whether the Licensing Act is as stringent
in Victoria as it is here, and how many public
houses there are between Keilor and Melbourne ?
With regard to the proposed visit to Eng-
land of an Australian football teain, an English
paper remarks; —“ It is not in the Englishman s
nature to like to be beaten or to take it contentedly.
Happily few opportunities of manifesting ill-will
occur at cricket; but at football, where two sides
would be engaged in violent personal encounter,
a word or accident might provoke a hasty re-
joinder, and a scene afterwards regretted. It is
better, perhaps, therefore, that there is no prospect
of a meeting.”
The Fawn has proved a perfect mine of
wealth to Mr. Andrew Town, who received 300
guineas for her first foal Richmond, 600 for Bos-
worth, 800 for Richmond Belle, 1500 for Palmyra,
2 MX) tor Segenhoe (the second thousand being given
provisionally that he won the Maribyrnong Plate),
3100 for Warwick, and 1950 for the yearling pur-
chased by the Hon. James White last January, or
in all 9050 guineas. She has another filly this year,
a id when sold this will no doubt bring the total up
to 10,000 guineas.
J. Sexton and H. Williams concluded a
match to walk six days, fair heel-and-toe, tor £5O,
at Newport, Monmouthshire, England, March 10.
The attendance was exceedingly light throughout,
scarcely paying expenses, but the contestants
stuck to tne'ir work with a determination born of
the purest pluck, and Sexton was ultimately pro-
claimed the winner, with 505 miles to his credit.
Williams’ score was 500 miles. There is some talk
of Edwards going home, but after this we think he
had better wait in Australia for “soft things.”
It is not only as a cricketer that Mr. Bligh
h is made a reputation. In 1876 he was the racquet
champion at Eton, and three years later saw him In
the same position at Cambridge, for which he was
successful in the Inter-University match. He has
played football with fair success; but tennis has
had greater charms tor him, and he is estimated as
one of the best tennis-players of the day. In 1879
he won the tennis handicap at Cambridge, and in £
the same year represented the University in the t
tennis match with Oxford. All round there are ,
few better or more popular athletes than the Hon.
Ivo Bligh. £
The S.A.J.C. held its second day’s racing i
on the 10th, with unusual success, weather belli# 1
all that was desired. Sting’s win for the Cup was J
a great throw in for the bookmakers. Appended 1
are the resultsSelling Hurdle Race: S. Tantrum’s
Anon, B. Doruwell’s Shamrock, J. H. Hill’s Light-
foot. All-aged Stakes: S. Barnard’s Dirk Hatter-
aick (3 years), W. Gordon’s Bis Bis (2 years), W. K. '
Moruock’s Royal Irishman (3 years). Autumn i
Handicap: Israelite, Paul, Prince Patrick. Maiden i
Plate: R. Love’s Hurricane (3 years), K. Griffiths’
Cardinal (3 years), T. Jordan’s Royal Highness (3 1
years). Nursery Handicap; T. Elder’s Monsoon
(by Gang Forward out of Typhoon), J.H. Aldridge’s
Sardius (late Emerald), J. H. Hill’s The Lawn.
Adelaide Cup: Sting (8st. 9B>.), Plunger (8st. 3fi>.),
Guesswork (8st. 5ft>.)
At the Wilcannia Annual Races, the
Hurdle Race was gained by a gelding called The
Quack, who, on the same afternoon, won the Fly-
ing Handicap, getting third in the W.J.C. Handi-
cap on the second day, and beating the favourite
hollow in the Farewell Handicap on the extra
afternoon. Another gelding named Slow Tom,
after winning the Maiden Plate, also beat the field
in the Town Plate, and the next day landed both
the WJ.C. Handicap and the Members’ Plate,
welter weights. The principal event of the meet-
ing, the Wilcannia Handicap, of 300 sqvs., fell to
another gelding, the little grey, Wee Jim —so well
known on the Sandhurst and other country
courses—who carried the steadier of 9st 31b, and
this was the only race he started for. The wind-
up event on the second day was run by the light
or the moon, such as it was, and it took some
trouble to distinguish the placed three out of the
eleven starters.
Horse-racing and honesty are generally
supposed by most steady-going people to be but
. cool acquaintances. This supposition may be
somewhat high-coloured, but such a revelation as
that made by “Nemo” the other day—of which wo
give the gist—is ground enough to justify a con-
siderable amount of suspicion. Before the Rand-
wick meeting Mr. E. E. Jones, the bookmaker,
received a letter from a Mr. M., a Wagga man,
asking odds on certain horses. Mr. Jones asked for
’ a cheque or a reference. A reference to a squatter
■ near Wagga was given, and “ the squatter” replied
in a few days saying that all was right, and would
Mr. Jones give him 1000 to 80 over something. Mr.
• Jones did, and all the bets were booked. None of
. the horses won. And when it came time to settle
up it was discovered that there was no Mr. M. and
no such squatter in existence. Also that the
letters had been sent by a clique, consisting of a
saddler, two blacksmiths, and a bootmaker, all
’ residents of the Southern district.
• J. G. White, one of England’s greatest
scullers some twenty-five years ago, has settled
In Maryborough (Q.) During his rowing career he
• pulled 76 races, winning 67, and beating such men
as George Drewitt. J. Finnis, and Harry Clasper
—the race with the latter over the champion
’ course, from Putney to Mortlake, being the fastest
then on record. In France, in the year 1857, at
3 Paris and Rouen, he won four races in one day,
3 being in each race pitted against a fresh man. For
this teat he was decorated by the late Emperor
Napoleon personally, receiving at his hands two
‘ splendid gold medals, and was highly compli-
15 mented by his Imperial Majesty on the prowess he
displayed on the occasion. He has also been de-
3 corated with a massive gold medal by the King of
t the Belgians for rowing performances in Belgium.
- He twice challenged Harry Kelly, the ex-champion
of England, for a stake of £300, but Kelly would
not pick up the gauntlet. He was, however, after
1 one of the most successful careers on record, at
l - last defeated by that wonder of his age, Harry
8 Chambers, in a race for the championship of the
• United Kingdom. Out of the numerous trophies
8 he has won in his time, he has brought to Mary-
borough—the Dogget coat and badge (one of the
f greatest curiosities probably ever seen in the
t colony), the medals presented to him by Napoleon
III., some valuable rings, and a number of Othel-
lo costly presents received at various times from dis-
h tinguised personages, the Prince of Wales in-
_ eluded.
William Lewis, who for many years has
i followed the not very lucrative business of catch-
d ing live rats for a livelihood, on the evening of
n March 17, in Frankford, Philadelphia, undertook,
s for a stated wager of £50, to pick up and place in
e an empty whisky-barrel 100 frolicsome rodents in
a one hour. About fifty persons were present, each
of whom was taxed a dollar to see the novel per-
formance. A space eight feet square was sur-
P rounded by a four-foot-high fence, the floor being
f i thickly covered with sawdust. The rats were con-
fined in tin-lined wooden cages, two containing
3 forty each and the other half as many. Lewis wore
3 a sleeveless undershirt, pants tied securely around
Y his ankles, and heavy shoes, and his hands and
arms were liberally dosed with musk, as a preven-
I tive against bites. The scene is thus described:
j, “ Forty rats were dumped into the pit. They
o darted wildly around through the sawdust, and
a made vain endeavours to scale the fence. Then
> they huddled in a wriggling mass in one corner,
•- and the judge gave Lewis the word to begin. He
h moved over to the pile of rats, and, without an
a instant’s hesitation, thrust his naked hands and
arms among them. He caught five fat fellows and
dropped them into the barrel. He next picked up
® three, then four, then two, and so on until six
minutes had expired, when he had placed twenty-
e one of the rodents in the barrel. The rats that re-
• mained in the pit were wild, and Lewis was com-
3 polled to catch them one at a time. The first single
■ rat he picked up bit one of his fingers through the
0 nail to the bone, and hung there. Lewis jerked his
£ hand up and sent the vicious rat against the ceil-
a ing. The wounded finger was dipped in whisky,
and the chase was resumed. Seven rats were picket,
e up and deftly tossed into the barrel, and then
n Lewis was bitten twice on the right arm. He re-
y ceived four more wounds before the fortieth rat
i- was imprisoned in the barrel. Then forty more
e were dumped into the pit. Lewis worked with
f great agility, and rat after rat was picked up and
t dropped into the barrel with amazing rapidity,
t The fifty-seventh rat he attempted to touch sprang
c in his face as he stooped, and bit through his lower
lip. Without flinching, he grabbed the rat and
tossed it through the canvas cover. He lost five
;- minutes staunching the blood that flowed from
h his lip. In picking up the other twenty-three rats
’s he was bitten slightly five times. Eighty rats were
r. in the barrel, and Lewis had only seven minutes to
II pick up the remaining twenty. The time was too
ss limited, and Lewis gave up the job and got out of
r, the pit.”
SPORTING GLEANINGS.
At Wagga, Treehy has beaten Hancock and

ball club under N.S.W. Association rules formed at
Newcastle ffm. Kirkwood, of Wanganui (N.Z.),
in shooting at a pigeon riddled his seven-year-old
son. Result fatal,...A report was current in
Sydney, on Thursday last, that a cable had been
received to the effect that Slade and Sullivan had
fought in America for the championship, and
that the latter had won. However, the rumour
appears to have been a canard Two magnificent
St. Bernard dogs, which are said to have cost some-
thing like £l5O, have been imported to Sydney by
a legal gentleman. The male animal is the biggest
dog yet seen in N.S.W. But our climate does not
suit the St. Bernard, which, encountering the heat
of summer, often becomes semi-delirious. These
dogs would thrive in the Monaro country The
much-talked-of 300 yards’ race at St. George,
between R. Heydon and J. Single, for £lOO a side,
proved a wretched fiasco. Heydon, after the first
100 yards, did as he liked and won in a walk
O’Leary leaves for ’Frisco by to-day’s ’Frisco mail.
J. Dawson and Spruce are to run at Wallsend,
for £5O a side Believing that the acceptance of
Hannibal, winner of the Hamilton (Vic.) handicap,
was not paid in proper time, the owner of Poor
Me (which horse ran second) is bringing an action
against the Racing Club for £lOO, the amount
that would have been won him had Hannibal
won the race and Poor Me not been in it ....

....When, in 1879, at Wagga, Edwards essayed to
walk 130 miles in 36 hours, Dr. Wren examined his
pulse after he had walked 34 hours, and found it
beating no faster than a labourer’s would have
beat who had simply been performing an
ordinary day’s work. The doctor pronounced
Edwards as a man of extraordinary phy-
sical endurance, with the heart of a 1i0n....
J. U. Groube has the highest batting average in
Victoria, with 63-30. Most in an innings for the
past season 91 “Jumbo” Walker has been
elected captain of the Redfern Football Club....
The Redfern Football Club open the season with a
scratch match on the 19th at Moore Park—The
Blayney Athletic Club offer a very nice and liberal
little programme for 34th, consisting of a dozen or
more events, calculated to bring good fields
together The professional bicycle race between
Rolfe and Irish and Thomas, the last two relieving
each other 1 , at Melbourne, resulted in a win for
Rolfe through Thomas carrying away part
of his machine. Rolfe was awfully done up,
and had to be carried into the pavilion—
The other day, off Bradley’s Head, a mullet was
captured in whose stomach a poker-hand of five
cards was discovered. It consisted of four dia-
monds and a spade. We can sympathise with a
mullet or any other man who has been playing
poker under distressing cix'cumstances. The fish
in this instance had been captured evidently
because it was tired of life, and resorted to this
means of leaving the briny. This is the way fishes
have of committing suicide. This mullet has
quite clearly been “drawing” to fill a four-flush,
and the spade that fell to it broke its heart—The
Melbourne Football Club, anticipating a great at-
tendance of bicyclists at their annual sports, have
offered a prize to the club which is most
numerously represented and best equipped....
Mr. Bell, captain of the Melbourne Bicycle
Club, sprained both wrists by a fall last week
George Giffen, the well-known cricketer, is about
to open a pub. in Adelaide.... The Canterbury
Times understands that Sir Modred will leave
shortly for N.S.W., consigned to the care of his
owner, Mr. Proudfoot, who is at present on a visit
to this colony. It is not decided yet who is to
accompany the Canterbury Cup hero—Reform,
winner of the Auckland J.C. Steeplechase, and
half brother to theiiiotorious Mata, was offered for
sale at Auckland, but tailed to find a purchaser—
The valuable thoroughbred horse, Palmbearer,
who ran second in the English Derby three years
ago, was consigned by the Halcione, which arrived
at N.Z., recently, from London, to Messrs. Clifford
and Weld, of Fiaxbourne (N.Z.) Unfortunately,
however 1 , the animal died during the voyage—
Captain Dundas, a gentleman well-known in sport-

office of clerk of the course for the Canterbury
Jockey Club.... Over £5OOO passed through the

St. Andrew, by Proto-Martyr—Sibyl, has been sold
to Mr. E. Weeks, who will take the colt to India—
The winter programme of the V.R.C. is much the
same as last year, containing, as it does, five events,
viz., Maiden Steeplechase of 150 sovs., Grand
National Hurdle Race of 300 sovs., Grand National
Steeplechase of 400 sovs., Selling Hurdle Race of
100 sovs., and Flat Race of 150 sovs—The old Pert
is playing great havoc in Melbourne waters. She
scored another very easy win last week. .. .Owing
to the protest entered against Slow Tom, winner of
the Maiden Race at Wucamiia, the stewards have
adopted the curious course of holding the rather
large amount of prize money won by his owner—
The Alexandria v. Peninsula C.C. met at Double Bay
on Saturday last, the result being an easy victory for
the local team by 95 runs and six wickets to fall.
The visitors, who went in first to bat, were unable
to make any stand against the excellent bowling
of J. Macintosh and H. Ellis, the total being 33, ol
which Noble contributed 13. At the call of time
the Alexandrias had lost four wickets for 137, T.
Van Heekeren making 31, T. Ridley 35, and W.
Smithers (not out) 55; Champion being the only
bowler who appeared to give any trouble ft
would not bo surprising to find, when the mail
arrives, that Prince Batthyany’s sudden death at
Newmarket was, in a measure, brought about by
the excitement incidental to the victory of the son
of his Derby winner, Galopin, in his big Spring
race Largan, while passing through Melbourne,
attributed his non-success in Sydney to his not
having kept rowing in view while passing through
America on his way out here, and local climatic
influence. Being used to a colder climate than
ours he could there do a deal of work, which he
was unable to do in Sydney. Directly he at-
tempted to do any extra exertion he felt done up,
andnad not the required energy during the heat—

the South Australian steeplechases. Mr. Martin
was offered 400 sovs. for the home, but refused it.
At a committee meeting of the V.R.C., Mr.
C. B. Fisher was elected chairman, vice Captain
Standish (deceased), and Sir W. J. Clarke was
appointed to fill the vacant place on the com-

, which is lighter by several pounds than any
, machine ever made m the country. It will be very
t close built, the backbone being within a quarter of
an inch of the rubber 1 , and the saddle will resc
. directly on the backbone. The handle-bar will be
, thirty inches long and will drop one inch at each
t end. It is intended to show English x-idex-s how

William Sherriff, alias “ Prussian,” challenged
Charles Mitchell, champion, on the eve of the
latter’s departure from England. In view of the
fact that the challenger was aware weeks previ-
ously that Mitchell was to start for the States at that
time, his action was rather cowardly, and not a bit
like business. The champion, in reply, says he will
be happy to accommodate Prussian, either in
America or immediately after his return to Eng-
land Mace and Slade left America for England,
last month Hanlan’s condition, re his match
with Wallace Ross, is that the Winnipeg residents
add £lOOO to the stakes Mace, with Slade, his
N.Z. half-caste protege, made £5OO at the exhibi-
tion at Washington, (U. 8.) Seats, 105.6 d., crowded..
Bargossi, who a few years ago was defeated by
George Hazael in a flfty-rallo race in London, is
announced to run from Rome to Paris for a five
hundred pounds wager Hanlan says he will
reply definitely to Hamm and Conley’s challenge
after he consults Lee. If they accept, the race
cannot be rowed before August, as he rows Ken-
nedy May 30, and he wants to give Ross a race
before doubling with anyone One of the best
footballers in the crack fifteen of Oxford Uni-
versity is an Australian, who sports the kangaroo
on his jersey After a splendid game, the annual
international football match at Sheffield termi-
nated in favour of Scotland by three goals to two.
Out of twelve of these contests Scotland has won
eight, England only two; two were drawn —G. C.
Stead, the New Zealand breeder, won the Payne
Stakes with the 3-year-old colt Splendour, at New-
market, England.... A twenty-five mil© backward
walking match recently came olf at New York,
America, between C. H. Ploof and James E.
Benson. Benson made first mile In llmin. 4sec.,
five miles in 1 hour 7 min., and 25 miles in 6 hours
3min. 135.; Ploof 1 mile 11 min. 7 sec., 5 miles 1
hour 16 min., and 21 miles in 6 hours 3 min. 13sec.
An Indian paper states:—‘‘There are rumours
of some disagreement between Lord William
Beresford and Mr. John Wilson over the horses
left in charge of the former by the latter.”. . .The
attendance at the Oxford-Cambridse Annual Sports
this year was very small. Cambridge scored six
wins out of nine events, which atoned greatly for
their beating in the boat race Cricket is evi-
dently not in our Maori cousins’ line. The
West Taieri Club’s scoring- book shows for
the season twelve Innings for 0, and twenty-
four of less than 3 runs each. We should
like to see the Illawarra men meet this club.
A lawn-tennis match would be nothing to it—
From a Boston contemporary we learn that John
L. Sullivan, satisfied that the Slade party do not
intend fight, has made up his mind to cross the
ocean and spend the Summer months in Great
Britain and on the Continent. We take the follow-
ing from the paper in question: “Sullivan has an
earnest desire to meet ‘Tug’ Wilson again, and,
unless that English worthy seeks safety in flight,
the champion will seek him in England before
Summer days have come.” The Italians had
their first Derby at Naples last month. Prize
worth 12,000 francs, and confined to horses bred in
Italy This year, the light-weight Queensberry
boxing championship was won by Hewlett, Cob-
den Club. In the middle weights (not over list.
41b.) Reed was victorious. Among the heavy
weights, Montgomerie received the verdict—
Raudon, the cricketer who played for Kent
County against the first Australian Eleven, is
dead Jack Ewin of Bethnal Green (age twenty-
five; weight, 125 lb.; height, 5 ft. 0 In.; winner of
140 lb. competition at Lambeth Baths, and 1321 b. at
the Royal Victor) and Dave Hayes of Stepney (age
twenty; height, 5 ft. B>s in.; weight, 144 lb.)
fought with nature's weapons, for a purse, March
5, near London, Eng. Ewin won easily in 28 min,
Hayes was greatly punished ... In a match at
Marylebone Grounds, Just before the mail left,
Franks, who gave Marsom 1% mile start, despite a
heavy rain all the while, covered 12 miles in 1 hour
34 min. 14 sec., and then passed his opponent, who
retired. This was a tremendous rate of travelling,
which very few could beat at even “ go-as-you-
please.” Mr. Edmund Tattersall has again taken
up the cudgels against the old-fashioned but
unrighteous practice of entries becoming void
through the decease of the nominator—W. C.
Dole, Jun., the instructor of the Pullman
Athletic Club, on March 24 performed the feat of
swinging a pair of 61b. Indian clubs continually for
three hours and a-half. It was. done for a small
wager. The actual number of motions made in
the last hour and forty minutes was accurately
counted, and amounted to 5180, being almost an
average of 52, and making the total number of
motions about 10,900. Dole did not seem any the
worse from the performance, excepting a few
blisters on his hands and slight soreness in the
shoulders James Paul, the well-known English
pedestrian, recently met with a serious accident,
necessitating the amputation of his left hand....
Fred. Kuhnie, the California rifle expert, made an
attempt to excel his previously unequalled score of
457 points at 200 yards, one hundred shots. The
wind was variable, blowing the greater part of the
time diagonally across the line of fire, and militat-
ing against success, but nevertheless Kuhnie
managed to tie bis former great score, his
shots all counting either bull’s-eyes or centres—
John Higgins, ex-charnpion sculler, whose book-
making ventures have of late been rather unfor-
tunate, on 15th March had a rousing “ benefit ” at
Lusby’s Winter and Summer Palace, London, Eng.
Many celebrities were present—Dr. W.F. Carver,
the rifle and trap shot, will, it is said, shortly join
forces with Buffalo Bill at New York, and appear
in a border drama, with real Indians and so forth.
The second pigeon-shooting match between
Capt. A. H. Bogardus and Dr. W. F. Carver was
decided at the Chicago (111.) Driving Park, America,
on 3rd March. One hundred birds each: Carver
won, with a score of 82; Bogardus being 3 behind,
with 79 ... Wallace Ross says that he is willing to
row Charles E. Courtney at any time that will
not conflict with other engagements.... The report
that Courtney had sued B. Wateis and Sons, of
Troy, N.Y., paper-boat builders for damages, is
not true.. . At Worcester, Mass., D. L. Dowd, the
well-known strong man, fairly raised from the
floor, with hands alone, 14111 b. of solid iron....

The fourth shooting match between Carver and
Bogardus was won by Carver on a score of 89 to 74.
....Mr. Crawfurd, says the World, died worth
about £600,000 and has left hla widow, the Duchtss
of Montrose, about £350,000 and all the property at
Newmarket The Duchess intends racing her
late husband’s stud. Sir John Aatley is to be-
her adviser Charles Mitchell, the Englisb
champion boxer, only 21 years of age, lias
arrived 'in New York, and is desirous of setting-
to with Sullivan. Mitchell only weighs 10st.
31b., but is a regular bruiser, and has a tine record.
Greenfield and Mitchell (the latter champion of
England) had a set-to at Madden’s show prior io
Mitchell leaving England for America, the veteran
Jim Hodgkins introducing them as the two great-
est boxers at present residing in Great Britam.
Greenfield opened fire, but was very tricky. Twice
he rushed in, receiving a good left-hander in the
body; then, slinging his right arm round Mitchell's
neck, he locked his head, and slung his left behind
his back on to Mitchell’s lace. This riled Mitchell,
who forced exchanges, and fought in grand form,.
In the second round Mitchell several times landed
his left as straight as an arrow on the body cf
Greenfield, countering on the head at the close.
Both fought most determinedly, and Hitche 1
landed again with his left on the body, and Greei -
field on the head of Mitchell. Following with his
right, Greenfield stepped back, and the two rolled
out of the ring, Greenfield underneath. The thiid
round was a really scientific display of attack
and defence, eacu man doing good work, and the
two shook hands amidst thunders of applause
Wrestling by female experts is the latest sensation
of a sporting nature in Paris ; exhibition*
given nightly by four Amazons, drawing large
crowds A beer-drinking contest of half-an-
hour’s duration, for a wager, took place, March 19,
at Washington, D.C., between an American and a
German, the former winning by draining twenty-
eight glasses while his opponent was getting away
with twenty-two. So it will be seen that the Teu-
ton was beaten at his own game—A Chinese

bet that he can eat thirty toads in as mapy days.

Them were too many clouds on Saturday
for the “show” people to be tempted out in great
numbers—too many of that unwelcome visitor
called by Shelley “the daughter of earth and
water, and the nursling of the sky” to allow the
“ daughters of men” to walk with a mind at ease,
while their material adornment, that had cost time,
thought, and money, was in danger of being
spoiled. Yet the Association Ground was well
patronised, and it was only when compared with the
greater aggregates of other occasions that the
attendance could be complained of. For the second
meeting of a new Club, held on a raw day, it was
encouraging. The chilly wind no doubt gave a
zest for promenading, for the stream of peripatetic
beauties that ebbed and flowed all the afternoon
between the press precincts and the smoking
paddock was considerable. Now and then a little
rush was made for shelter, as the rain-clouds burst
in a light cold spray; but these were very tem-
porary interruptions, and blustering Eolus couldn’t
clear the lawn, cracked bo his cheeks ever so. The
Governor and Lady Loftus were present for about
an hour, and the music of the full City Band, which
played out in the cricket ground, was a treat. It
was remarkable what an effect the wind had on the
bicycles; round one corner they came like a passing
flash, while on the opposite side of the course the
toiling wheelers, bent double with exertion,
were sometimes almost at a standstill. Lee’s
rush in the 4-mile race was grand. Among
the occupants of the lawn, one of the most
taking costumes was cloth skirt of dull dark green,
Sleated flounces, and a green-check panier bodice,
at of bright green plush; the varying shades all
blended in pood taste being very effective. The
two attractive daughters of a stock auctioneer
came early to the ground Inglis-tening dresses of
velvet and satin, one being black, the other
maroon, with trimmings of same. Two little
musical sisters in maroon velvet, and large felt
and plush hats of bathstono hue, (hailed from
Miller’s Point. Then an elderly gentleman came
round the comer, looking careworn under the
crushing responsibility of no less than six young
ladies, of whom the three seniors looked charming,
all in dresses entirely of black velvet trimmed with
sable, Mother Hubbard collars of worked white
satin edged with snowy swansdown, large hats of
black felt with thick edging of sable, and a bunch
of scarlet flowers comfortably tucked behind each
left car. And by the time anyone could notice and
appreciate all this niceness, the three junior young
ladies had disappeared. A pleasant-looking old
lady was soon relieved of her charming charge in a
plain purple-check dress, who is the daughter of
an artist, and very lovely. The wife of an architect
from the Globe displayed a nice blue sorgo with
narrow gold braiding, and a pretty bonnet and
feather of bright cobalt blue over a vivacious
face. A William-street brunette adopted the
same trimming for a dark green cloth. An Ultimo
girl wore a pigeon-drab cashmere with moird
Sleeves and trimmings, that was not remarkable;
she was, however, for her sparkling pretti-
noss. The wife of a city auditor from Woollahra
wore a splendid cocoa-coloured inoini antique
with satin bunching and trimmings—it was one of
the best dresses on the stand; and her daughter
wore a cloth overskirt known as caftS an lait shade
of brown, and an underskirt which was in admir-
able keeping, of ruby velvet. With a well-known
singer came his sweet-voiced wife and her sister in
handsome dresses of most bouffant style, one of
sheeny dark green, the other electric blue, prin-
cess bonnets to harmonise. A little Hebrew lady,
a brunette, owned a costume of curious design: a
flowing black cashmere with a long narrow tab
down each side, the outlines marked with narrow
gold edging; more apt to disguise than display a
neat figure. From Paddington, was the wife of
an Assembly Official in rich mauve velvet, and her
daughter, who was a casket—a cooper’s casket—of
charms, in cardinal figured velvet. A recent bride
was brought on the scene by her husband in a
very pretty fawn brochc; and a natty dross of
Persian pattern, combining the metallic tints of
bronze and silver, enveloped a leading stationer’s
wife. The weather turned extremely cold by five
o’clock, and when the sports ended soon after-
wards, most of the ladies’ faces were very pinched
and pale, and there was decidedly more blue than
pink in their cheeks. The Superintendent of
Tramways no doubt foresaw this chilly state of
things, and so he carefully arranged for the grate-
ful public to—walk home.
* * *
One of the most sought-for invites in
’Frisco is to the Annual High Jinks of the Bo-
hemian Club. As the name imports, it is a club to
which the members, it not misogynists, profess at
any rate to be indifferent to the other sex. The
fact that they are treading on a mysterious, half-
forbidden threshold, renders the affair more
delicious to the ladies. The Bohemians, however
prove themselves splendid hosts once in the year
The whole of the fine club buildings are thrown
open : In the Jinks hall there is dancing to a pro-
fessional band : then there are reading, conversa-
tion, retiring, reception, whist, and many other
small rooms, luxuriously fitted. Besides an epi-
curean supper, ices, wines, trifling confections are
served round all the time to every one who desires
them. Among the items of last Jinks were ad-
dresses by the first literary men, on “ The wife of
to-day,” and “The ideal husband ;” musical exer-
cises, hidden choruses sung in the semi-darkness,
and some of the unwritten songs of Bohemia were
given, and a decorous Low Jinks performed, to the
intense delight of the favoured lady guests. The
affair all through possessed the charm of great
novelty. Here’s an idea for Sydney.
* * *
Enjoyable’ dance at “ Creedmoor,” Pad-
dington, on the 9th. Pretty girls, good music, &c.
The most noticeable dresses were the hostess’ a
mixture of brown silk velvet; her two daughters
in black satin, trimmed with pink roses, and in
cream nun’s veiling with wreath of blue bells
A married lady from Regent-street, in pink satin
with silver trimmings. A young lady from North
Shore, in peacock blue satin, trimmed with white
broche. Two sisters from Woollahra, in nun’s veil-
ing, one trimmed with pale blue satin and forget-
me-nots, the other with pink satin and lily of the
valley. A young lady from Upper William-street,
in white cashmere, trimmed with maroon velvet
Two cousins, one from Balmain, and the other
from Glebe Point, in pink cashmere, trimmed with
cream lace ; wreaths of pink roses. A Melbourne
lady in old gold satin. Break up at three.
* * *
The Owls gave a ladies’ night last week.
The proceedings, except that the air was not
opaque with smoke, were exactly on the lines of
the ordinary programme. Mr. James Caddy,
president, delivered an opening speech, which
bristled with shuddering puns ; and the main item
of the evening was the farce “ Winning Hazard,”
*
which was tolerably funny, Messrs. J. H. Rainford,
A. Isaacs and H. G. Benson having the male parts
to perform, while Miss Harvey and Miss Stanley,
two pleasing amateurs, had to love and be loved,
which was of course easy. Other items were :
overture by Mr. Huenerbein and Miss Jessie
Patrick; Daley and Delaney’s Dell of Dreams, by
Bullfinch; songs by Yellow Hammer, Strike and
Miss Alderdico; musical selections by Lyre and
Miss Menser, Messrs. Huenerbein and Maxted;
mouth organ solo by Macair; a remarkably fine
recitation, “The Letter of Death,” by Mr. Hyman,
of Melbourne; and “Little Jirn,” recited by Miss
Stanley. At various periods, the president made
amusing speeches, and there was a good interval
for refreshments and social converse all round.
The affair was held in the large hall in connection
with the Cambridge Club, and it was drawing
towards midnight ere the entertainment closed.
* * *
The Manly Rowing Club holds its first
annual ball on 23rd instant, in the local Oddfellows’
Hall. The Liedertafel band provides music, Com-
pagnoni (caters, and the proceeds go in aid of club
funds. And, by the way, where and when do the
members of the Manly Rowing Club row ? We
saw one of them in an outrigger once, but that
was long ago. Ho was attired in his club uniform,
and he also wore a short^plpo.
The second monthly Bachelors’ Assembly
was held at Nithsdale on Friday, and despite the
weather there was a large gathering—m fact,
almost too many for free dancing. The music was
excellent (it is seldom otherwise at Nithsdale), and
many pretty costumes were observable. A Surry
Hills lady wore a handsome black gros-de-lyon;
and a brunette in white satin and tulle was nice.
Salmon satin embroidered in gilt beads and silk
came from Moore Park—a sort of goodwin-ter
dress; and a slim sylph in blue satin and black lace
looked eva so well. A lithsome dancer was from
Dowling-street, and a brunette belle in black moire
and passementerie from St. Benedict’s direction,
was very be-coomb-ing. Two sisters from Palmer-
street displayed pink silk and plush, and striped
cream skirt with blue satin body, respectively. A
pretty little maid made a pretty little picture in
white India muslin, calculated to mdia anyone with
soft feelings; and there were other attractions too
numerous to mention this time, including a pleni-
tude of partners and refreshments, the latter
vanishing rapidly,
** * *
The first Bachelors’ Ball at Taree was held
in the Agricultural Hall, a few nights ago, and
passed so pleasantly that, when daylight drew near,
the guests wanted to taree still On the 3rd May,
Mr. E. Rosenthal, of Sydney, was married at St.
James’ to Miss M. Birnie, of Darlington, who
looked lovely in ivory satin, exquisitely made, and
trimmed with Brussels lace and moire, long train;
wreath and blossoms. Four bridesmaids wore
cream nun’s veiling, trimmed with pale blue satin,
and wreaths to match. The bride’s little page was
habited in black silk velvet and honitou lace; and
her fair and stately sister in rich ruby satin and
cream lace, princess bonnet in keeping. Breakfast
at residence of bride’s parents, and honeymoon to
Mount Victoria Mrs. Augusta Piercy (nee
Dargon) has been gracing the Stage again, at
Wagga, in connection with Sheridan’s visit there.
There will be a ball on the 24th The bazaar at
Parramatta, in aid of the Sisters of Mercy’s new
Convent, will be opened in the Park Pavilion on
Wednesday, at two o’clock, by the Rev. Mgr. Lynch.
We hear that the Gymnastic Club in Parramatta
is doomed. It’s a peculiar and sad fact that nothing
seems to last long in slow, sweet Parramatta. The
Rowing Club is torpid, and the Dramatic Club
dead; even the hope that hung around the ten-
mile clause has vanished. Parramatta has an un-
lucky facility for starting now enterprises with all
the rushing enthusiasm that attends the opening
of a penny bottle of ginger-pop—and when the
froths gone, there’s really nothing left Mr.
J. W. Brougham, of Outer Netallie, Wilcannia,
gave a nice ball on the 20th April, which was so
enjoyed that dancing was hardly done at daylight.
Mrs. E. B. L. Dickens was voted belle The Yass
Private Subscription Ball comes off in the local
Mechanics’ Institute on Friday, 25th May An
authority on fashion writes from home“ The
attempts to reinstate the crinoline are continued,
but as those most concerned (the ladies) oppose it,
and the fashion papers ridicule it, it is hardly pro-
bable that anything will come (if it.” Dr. P.
Sydney Jones, who left by the Carthage yesterday
i Wednesday) was entertained last Thursday at a
Jotany picnic, when several score of ladies and
gentlemen sat down to dinner in Correy’s pavilion,
and his health was drunk. Next night the medicos
of Sydney gave him a valedictory dinner at
Aarons’ Exchange, Dr. Fortescue in the chair.
Some very complimentary speeches wore made
Another departing citizen, Mr. Archibald Forsyth,
the well-known rope-merchant of Surry Hills, and
of the City Bowling Club, was the guest at a picnic
to the Sir Joseph Banks Hotel on Tuesday, when,
notwithstanding the forbidding weather, a number
of his lady and gentlemen friends did him honour,
the Bowling Clubs being prominent Several
Private assemblies have opened the season. The
yduey one at Nithsdale started on Friday, the 4th
May, and the Burwood gathering took place in the
local Town Hall on the 11th instant; and the Bal-
main one a few nights ago — On Wednesday next,
the second annual competition will take place at
the Sydney Gymnasium, when every method of
physical education will bo illustrated by exercises
and apparatus, and five gold medals will be given
as prizes to the most successful competitors
Among the marriage events recently announced is
that of a well-known Pitt-street warehouseman
(near Tattersall’s) who won the hand of a wealthy
widow from Burwood—Recently an announce-
ment was made of the marriage of Mr. Harry
Goodwin, a member of one of the oldest Sydney
families, to the sprightly daughter of a wealthy
South Sydney householder.

Nowhere perhaps has the dentist’s art obtained
such high excellence as in Sydney. Certainly we
are in no sense behind any other city. Visitors to
Sydney might, to test this, visit the establishment
ot Messrs. Adolphe Gabriel and Company, 18 Wyn-
yard Square, two doors from Pfahlert’s Hotel.
Here the manufacture of every essential in the
profession is carried on. At the rear of the surgery
is a compact little factory where all the requisites
for supplying every dental defect in the human
mouth are made. Messrs. Gabriel and Co. (whose
only address is as above) are always pleased to
show their specimens of artificial teeth to those
interested. There being two firms of the same
name in the Square, patients will oblige by paying
particular attention to the Christian name, Adolphe,
and the number, 18, two doors from Pfahlert’s
Hotel.—Ad vt.
" THE POOR PLAYER.”
[Correspondence is invited from members of the
Theatrical Profession .]
Mr. Louis N. Parker, of Ipswich (Q.), has
composed a cantata, “ Silvia,” which has twice been
successfully performed by the local musical
society —Bland Holt advertises by means of a
cheque (his own) for £10,000,000; a poor fool pre-
sented a copy of his advertisement at one of the
Melbourne banks, and has been arrested Poor
Tom Casselli, of the Emelie Melville Company, is
dying- of consumption at Melbourne—Bandmann
and Bcaudet gradually working their way down
South, and are advertised to appear at Mary-
borough (Q.) on the 23rd for four nights Miss
Alice Bees must have a good friend amongst the
Sydney telegraphic correspondents. This is all one
says about her, and in the Australasian too
“ She distanced all the Italians.” They can’t put
any more on her plate now. There’s no room, not
even for an encomiastic stick of telegraphic
“sparrow-grass.” We think, however, that some-
one ought to be found who could spoon a little into
Signora Graziosi’s tureen Fred. Maccabe goes to
America from Auckland by first ’Frisco mail.. .
George Darrell’s new play is entitled “The Naked
Truth,” It is to be hoped that the critics will not
tell it about, or else Mr. Darrell will be ordering
apartments at Yarra Bend Asylum, and hiring an
able-bodied man to keep his hair on Another
par. Mr. E. M'Lean, late proprietor of M‘Lean’s
Troubadours, and a man well and favourably
known all over the colonies for his pantomimic
proficiency and the perennial bloom on his visage,
is taking a company of burlesque artists through
the northern districts overland to Queensland.
They open at Maitland on Queen’s Birthnight.

Henry Irving has 1000 wigs, no two of
which are exactly of the same shade Poor
Chiarini’s blindness resulted thus : He met with a
severe fall from a horse. Doctors advised him not
to ride again for some time, and to confine himself
to a dark room to avert threatened inflammation.
Nevertheless, he went to Cochin China with his
troupe, and there both rode in the ring and exposed
his eyes to the glaring sunlight. In a few days the
inflamation declared itself violently. One of his
eyes was taken out, with the hope that by so doing
the other might be saved ; but the operation was
without good result, and he is now entirely and
hopelessly blind Alice Dunning Lingard was to
have played Camille at a matinee at the Gaiety
Theatre, London, on 30th Feb. The Lord Chamber-
lain has at last given a license for this piece; so a
sincere version of it will, it is said, be witnessed for
the first time in London. It has hitherto been
played there in an enfeebled or expurgated form.
Adelaide Kistori, now 05, is a wreck, and was a
failure a few weeks ago, at Rome, in “ Marie An-
toinette.” But she is wealthy—There’s been some
noise in N.Y. about an actor assaulting atr actress.
The facts are that Mr. J. H. Stoddard, who is ner-
vous and hasty, ordered Miss Maude Harrison to
do something to which she objected. She refused;
he repeated, and she cried. Then he insisted, and
used ungentlemanly language. Then, as a matter
of course, Maude intimated she’d die first. Where-
upon Stoddard caught her shoulders, forced her on
to her knees, gripped her neck, and, after a good
shaking, flung her, face down to the floor. Maude
was a little hurt, and a great deal frightened; but,
still she is awfully happy, for “he didn’t make hex-
do it—there, now!”—A Louisville writer finds that
the performance of Galatea by a certain actress is
“ like a babe that opens its wide eyes for one mo-
ment on the world, and then leaves it with a sigh;
like a flower that breathes its fragrance for a day
upon the earth of which it is not; like a grand
strain of music that floats and throbs at twilight and
sinks away into the dim roaches of which we dream,
but in which wo cannot walk; too pure for the
world, and yet leaving behind a memory,a perfume,
a harmony tenderer, sweeter, more exalting.”
William Horace Lingard has, so the papers say,
failed to pay his company, and “skipped” from
California—Mary Anderson will appear at Lon-
don Lyceum in November.... The very latest is
that a Langtry-Wales-Gebhardt combination will
travel next season... .When Mrs. Langtry played
at Milwaukee, all were satisfied that she couldn’t
act well, but as she wore a low-necked dress there
were many who could see traces of merit in her
performance....At Brooklyn, March 7, Miss Ida
Hosraer, age 26, weight 45 pounds, and height 38
inches, was married to Major Littleflnger, age 24,
weight 54 pounds, height 40 inches. He is a native
of Boston, a widower, and has one child, nine
months old, weighing six pounds... .Apropos of
the theatre-fire on the evening of what was to
have been Mrs. Langtry’s first American appear-
ance, — apropos, also, of the attention paid her by
Gebhardt, it is remarked that she started with a
fire and has since been followed by a flame
Signor Nicolini is reported to have said that he
does not care what American critics say of him, as
ho has plenty of money, and only sings to “ please
Patti.” Miss RoseCoghlan has written an able
article on the stage in which she concludes that, an
actress ought not to marry at a11.”....The man
who represented the Saviour in the rehearsals of
the “Passion Play,” at New York, was locked up
for drunkenness, and the actress who was to have
taken the part of the Virgin sued the manager for
breach of agreement.... Lord Ward offered Sara
Bernhardt £5OO for the ragged little suit she
wore when her talent was first discovered, but
she wouldn’t take it. The Marquis of Hereford
offered Rachel two diamonds worth 20,000 francs
for the guitar she used when singing for bread in
the streets of Paris, and which she carried with her
till her death. “ Not for all the jewels in the crown
of England,” she said. The Marquis had Garrick’s
umbrella, Mdlle. Mars’ fan. Talma’s watch, and
the last bottle of wine which Kean drank from,
and which fell from his hand half emptied
Wagner’s “Parsifal” is a sort of “ Passion Play,”
where a lady washes the hero’s feet and dries them
with her hair and which also furnishes a tableau of
the Holy Supper anointings and baptisims. For
these reasons its performance has just been for-
bidden in London.

Coffee and cinchona cultivation is proceed-
ing apace in the Northern Territory. Mr. Poett
will have in a few months about 300,000 coffee
plants. The cinchona attains in the Territory a
size unequalled in Ceylon or elsewhere. The in-
dustry is a very profitable one. At its lowest
calculation, 35., 16001 b. per acre will give a bi-
yearly return of £l6O an acre. At a sale in London
the produce of a forty-acre farm was sold for
£14,000.
Now that Tattersall’s (Messrs. Hawkes and
Co.’s) great establishment in Castiereagh-street is
in full swing, it is easy to be seen that we have
in Sydney the finest hostelry probably in the
world, but certainly in Australia. Neither New
York nor London has anything so extensive or of
such excellent design. This great establishment is
probably without a model, and does immense
creditto Mr. Hawkes. The building has four tiers of
horse boxes, the horses being taken to the top of
the building either up an incline or in a powerful
steam elevator. Every floor is composed of Val de
Travers asphalte, and each stall is bedded with
granite. Feed is supplied by shoots to
each box, and the refuse is carried off in
a similar manner. Water is laid on in every stall,
and there are large baths for horses. The auction
mart, which is destined to be the great centre of
the horse trade, is surrounded by seats, which are
gladly availed of by spectators, admission being
by ticket. About 350 horses are accommodated on
the premises; and as the main business is done
with the public, there is a great number of vehicles
for hire. There are ladies’ waiting rooms, &c.,
commercial and smoking rooms, &c., a grand ball-
room extends along the whole front of the build-
ing, and a hundred offices or more are available
for commercial or professional requirements.
Altogether, Tattersall s Auction Mart is a great
building, and does infinite credit to the enterprise
of Sydney.

An Australian Inland Sea.
Even when Sturt, on his third and last journey in
search of an Australian Inland Sea, got hemmed in
amid the dreadful droughts and awful stillnesses
of Stony Desert, he never could quite divest him-
self of the notion that such a sea existed some-
where to the centre of the Australian
His theory was that the continent was in the form
of a common saucer, slanting down on all sides
towards the centre, where he supposed the great
inland sea would be found; and this the South
Australians have lately ascertained to be the case
with that portion of their territory lying to the
North of Spencer’s Gulf—minus the sea itself.
There now comes the bold proposal to substitute for
the further extention of the S.A. Great Northern
Railway such a sea as Sturt once dreamed of. Some
Adelaide engineers, and others, notably Mr. R. C.
Baker, hold that this startling scheme is not only
perfectly practicable, but that the land lost by the
construction of this great sea would be more than
compensated for by the climate being made cooler
and moister, by the droughts being rendered less
common and less severe when they came, by the
enhanced value given to neighbouring lands, and
by the great extent of water carriage that would
be provided for settlers. It is maintained that
the sea could be constructed with much greater
ease and at far less cost than the Suez Canal on
other works of the same kind, and that It would,
when constructed, be equally or more beneficial in
its results. The abettors of the scheme point out
that a creek runs from Port Augusta to Lake
Torrens, that the lake is often dry, or nearly so,
and that cutting a channel through it would be
easy work; that a number of small creeks existing
to the north of Lake Torrens run into Lake Eyre,
and that the waters from the former, supplied by
Port Augusta, at the head of Spencer’s Gulf, could
be readily conveyed to the latter, and the desired
inland sea then be formed. But this is a scheme
for about the middle of next century—for the time
when the Murray will be rendered properly navi-
gable at a roughly-estimated cost of ten to fifteen
millions. Mr. C. K. Haly, one of the most ex-
perienced squatters in Australia, argues, with re-
ference to the inland sea prospect, that a low-lying
channel should be found somewhere on the south-
western side, leading to Spencer’s Gulf. Mr. Haly
reminds colonists that a drought lasted from 1837
to 1841, and thinks no expense should be grudged
to avert a similar catastrophic season. Mr. L.
Hopkins, our staff artist, obligingly gives life view
of the affair, on this page.
Marks Hermann, the 1400 per cent. Mel-
bourne usurer, the other day asked his little son
what he meant to do when he became a man.
Young Hermann at once replied that be would get
a brass-plate engraved with “ Loan and Discount
Bank,” and then go hunting for fools—” just like
you do, pa.”
The first thing Jem Mace inquired for npott
his arrival at Washington was the spot where
Garfield was shot. He was conducted to the ladled
waiting-room, and shown the small brass star which
marks the place where the late President received
his death-wound. Reverently removing his haZ
Mace looked at the star for a minute, then, turmjS
to his wife, said: “ Darling, put yerfoot on hit, Jusft
for luck.”
BLASTED HOPES.
Down to the South to seek his fortune,
Down to the glorious land of gold,
Where the sun is stronger, the fair days longer,
And all is a man’s to have and hold:
Where all’s a man’s who has a strong heart ;
A will to work and a mind to plan—
Down with the summer to where each comer
Need say for a password, “ I’m a man !”
He went, the scion of noble fathers —
His race’s fortunes had long declined—
Leaving a maiden with sorrow laden.
To bear his image ever in mind.
Then round again to the Spring, that brought n»
Blossom of hope to her hungry heart;
Ah, do you marvel that they who starve 111
Are they who never knew hunger’s smart ?
“ I’ll seek my love,” she cried in anguish,
“ I’ll seek my lost love by land and sea—
He’ll leave his new love to clasp his true love,
And all will be as it used to be !”
So o’er the sea this loyal lady
Sailed, with her thoughts flying on before.
She was then so elated and agitated
She thought of meeting him on the shore.
THAT INLAND SEA.
The sky was bright above as he left her,
The sea where the good ship rode was blue.
And she vowed gently, he violently.
In life or death they would both be true.
Long years rolled on, but she no word of
Her distant lover all those years heard,
And she’d say, half crying, “ He’s dead or dying:.
Or he’d have sent me at least a word !”
The Autumns passed with their wealth of gold
corn,
The Springs danced by with their braids of
fiow’i-s.
Then birds stopped singing, and winds came
bringing
The Winter dark with its snows and showers.
She landed—but why string out the story—
At first she was full of fear and doubt,
Till some ope told her—her heart grew bolder—
Perhaps the police could find him out.
She tried. “ How looked he ?” they asked her,
“ Ah, he’d an air distingui —a look of rank.”
“ His name it is now ?” “ Ah, well he is now
Doing five years for robbing a bank I”
