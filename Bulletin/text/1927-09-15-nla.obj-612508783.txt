£1700 in Prizes for Novels
The Bulletin has received countless
hosannas on the announcement of its inten-
tion to give at least'£l7oo in prizes for novels
during the next three years. As the first
competition will close on June 30, 1928,
writers will not have any time to lose. The
first prize in this first competition will be
£5OO, the second £125, the third £75. The
prize stories are to be available for serial
publication in The Bulletin or the
Woman’s Mirror; otherwise all rights are
to belong to the writers, anil this includes
not only right of book publication but pic-
ture rights. The winning of the prize will
be so fine' an advertisement that large book
sales seem certain; and if the story lends
itself to the films, the picture rights should
also be very valuable. It looks as though
for almost the first time an Australian
novel-writer will have a chance to make a
big thing financially out of his work.
The conditions announced seem to have
given general satisfaction. Of course, a few
questions have been asked. Chiefly what
length must the story be? The announce-
ment mentioned a “full-length” novel. The
Bulletin does not want to cramp anyone’s
style. It wants to give, the widest possible
scope to every writer to express himself in
his own way. It will only say therefore that
it cannot believe the judges would regard
a novel of less than 60,000 words as “full-
sized.” The maximum must be left to
the writer; but a novel which goes beyond
100,000 is not suitable for serial publication,
and something around 80,000 words has been
found most suitable. At the same time,
though naturally The Bulletin will be dis-
appointed if the prize novels are not good
serial stories, it certainly will not ask the
judges to rank them for their merit as
serial stories.
It has also been asked whether they must
be Australian stories. Here, again, The
Bulletin will not cramp the authors in any
way. All it requires is that the work shall
be by Australian-born writers or writers who
are bona fide resident in Australia —Aus-
tralia for the purposes of this condition in-
cluding Maoriland and the South' Pacific
islands.
George Gordon McCrae
I have been privileged to know many
Very old Australians who retained their
faculties to the end of their days, and
had faculties to retain. T. A. Browne, who
was Rolf Boldrewood; W. F. Parker, an old
goldfields P.M.; Cuthbert Fetherstone-
haugh; W. E. Abbott ; a venerable Queens-
land lady whose elder sister had been a pet
of Governor Macquarie—all of them could
carry their memories back to three genera-
tions ago, and none of them had that ten-
dency to enthusiastic exaggeration which
often makes old age so picturesquely un-
reliable concerning the days of its youth.
But perhaps the clearest minded of them,
all was George Gordon McCrae. To the
end of his days his judgment of past times
and of men long dead and gone was as
evenly balanced as must have been those
auditor’s reports by the compilation of
which for so many years, long ago, he
earned his living. An invaluable quality
this, in the estimation of those who like
their history uncolored by imagination—as
invaluable in the aged as it is unfortunately
rare.
They were great men, that sort —men of
an unfaltering faith in their country and
themselves. There was nothing mean or
self-seeking in anything they did or any-
thing they thought, for all meannesses had
been denied them at’birth. They were too
generous to regard their own youth as hav-
ing been better lived or their own youthful
aspirations as nobler, than those of the
young men they knew in their latter days.
And, 'for the same reason, they did not
consider that, with the passing of the inti-
mate contemporaries of their days of man-
hood, the world had lost all its goodfellow-
ship. Old age can be bitterly pessimistic
about the present. Such men as these did
not have it, in them to be so. They kept
their faith in their fellows of all ages.
The lifetime of George Gordon McCrae
was contemporaneous with the lifetime of
Victoria. The Port Phillip settlement dates
from 1835; he came there with his mother,
as a child of six, in 1841. For 88 years he
saw Melbourne grow- from a primi-
tive village' amid the gum-trees on the
Yarra into what it is to-day. There have
not been many who could .claim such a
record.
He was born in Scotland, near Leith, on
May 29, 1833. His father, Andrew Murison
McCrae, was a lawyer, and his mother,
Georgians Huntley Gordon, an artist of
more than ordinary ability, who had ex-
hibited at the Royal Academy. Sir Thomas
Mitchell, returning home in 1838 after his
overland journey from Sydney to Port
Phillip two j years before, was full of en-
thusiasm about the country to the south
of the Murray which he had named Aus-
tralia Felix, and being a close personal
friend of the McCraes was able to persuade
the head of the family to try his fortune in
the new land. Andrew McCrae arrived in
Melbourne in 1839, Mrs. McCrae follow-
ing two years later, and settled in the
neighborhood of Arthur’s Seat, where Dro-
mana is now situated. Here he remained
until the early ’fifties, when he sold his
station and accepted an appointment as a
police magistrate.
Young McCrae’s boyhood was spent on
the station, and the • impressions of these
years held much of inspiration for those
in which he began to write. When he w T as
16 he sat out to earn his own living, and
after a short experience in a merchant’s
office and then in a bank, he joined the
staff of the Auditor-General of Victoria at
the beginning of 1854. Having served in
various capacities in several Government
departments, he finished his official career
in 1893 as Deputy Registrar-General. Early
in the ’sixties his literary activities began to
be noticeable, and they continued almost to
the day of his death, when he had been
engaged for several years upon his “Remi-
niscences.”
But the thanks of his country are due to
him not so much for what he wrote as for
what he did in the encouragement of Aus-
tralian literature—an assistance which it
sorely needed in those pioneering days. With
“■Orion” Horne, Marcus Clarke and others,
he made the reputation of the Colonial
Monthly a high one in the ’sixties, and did
much to bring Adam Lindsay Gordon and
Henry Kendall into the heritage that is
theirs. He was one of the founders of the
Yorick Club, and doubtless the “Remini-
scences” contain many good stories relating
to the brilliant circle, that used to assemble
there. It is more than to be hoped that,
whether incomplete, or not, his last work
will find a publisher. It must inevitably be
a valuable contribution to the story of
Australian literature.
J.H.M. A.
The White Blend
There is a theory, many times worked
out in historical volumes, that political and
social movements are more worthy of
record and study than the histories of wars
between race and race and the stories of
kings who were the old-time race leaders.
To deny the importance of race is, however,
largely to miss the significance of the poli-
tical and social movements themselves. The
same elements in struggle among the
Chinese do not necessarily produce the same
results as among Europeans, nor are the
forces which operated in ancient Rome
likely to lead to a similar climax among
the peoples of Afghanistan. The first and
most important historical fact which we.
need to know about ourselves is not that a
Reform Bill was passed in such and such
a year, but our own racial origin, the kind
-of people our ancestors were and their
ideals, limitations and finer qualities. This
is the aspect of history which Arthur
Weigall presents in Wanderings in Anglo-
Saxon Britain (Hodder and Stoughton).
The author is an authority on Egypt-
ology, and his general work covers a very
wide field, but early Britain has been his
playground. His present book on the
period between the coming of the Jutes and
the Norman Conquest is all fresh and in-
teresting. He tosses aside with a light
hand much that the ordinary reader, fed
on Green and others, has accepted as true,
and shows that the ancestry of the English
is as much British as German—possibly a
good deal more. He stresses the mixed
nature of the population of Britain after
the withdrawal of the legions. But the idea
that the original inhabitants; were extermi-
nated goes entirely by the board. Old
documents constantly refer to the Britons
living in Saxon districts.. As late as 620
a British kingdom maintained its indepen-
dence around Leeds in Yorkshire. One
very prominent king of Wessex bore a
British name and another a name which
meant “half-breed.” The Venerable Bede,
in the eighth century, makes the position
fairly clear. He represents England as in-
habited by the Anglo-Saxons, Britons and
Latins, and says that the use of the Latin
tongue is returning the reading of
the Scriptures. This should prove that
three full centuries after the Saxon inva-
sion there were not only British communi-
ties in the Saxon countries, but that Roman
communities definitely kept their distinc-
tion of race and language.
But the most remarkable thing about the
book is its assertion of the high civilisa-
tion of the Anglo-Saxon people. The spade
of the archaeologist has dug up countless
treasures of the early Saxon period. These
indicate that fine ornaments of gold and
silver were in common use and that fine
glassware and plate for the table were
manufactured. Thousands of articles, such
as clasps, buckles, bronze utensils, sword
hilts and stone crosses, testify the skill of
early Saxon craftsmen. Graves have yielded
the greater part of the spoil; and as the
Saxons ceased to bury treasure with their
dead after the adoption of Christianity, the
finds indicate the level of civilisation in
the first nagan century after the original
invasion. Very little was borrowed from
the Romans, though certain pottery works
of Roman times seem to have continued
working far into the Saxon period. The
invaders did not care for the Roman house,
which they may have regarded as un-
healthy, but in some cases tlrey used Roman
structures for pagan temples and in others
Roman tiles were taken from ruins to build
info Saxon walls. The book is freely
illustrated by plates and cuts which give a
very good idea of Saxon art.
The author, whose manner is of the
simplest throughout, has a good eye for

picturesque incident. He has also the knack
of impressing a point by reference to some
striking known fact. Thus the civilisation
of Wessex is suddenly made plainer than
it could be by any amount of archaeological
detail by the simple statement that the
organ in Winchester Cathedral during the
later Saxon period had 400 pipes of bronze
and 26 bellows.
Alfred in these pages is placed in a
stronger and more splendid setting than in
any other work I have seen. His achieve-
ments are lightly sketched, but it is made
clear what the effect of his victories over
the Danes really was. The grand army of
these plunderers operated from time to
time not only in England, but in all the
lands of Western Europe. Alfred, by
smashing their power on English soil and
destroying their vessels in English waters,
not only saved a little kingdom south of the
Thames, but destroyed a force which
threatened to break up the remaining civili-
sation of mankind. When Alfred at Ash-
down, “charging up the hill like a boar,”
crushed the front of the Viking horde, leav-
ing a king, five generals and thousands of
dead on the field, lie struck a blow which
resounded through all Europe. And when,
later, lie won the greater victory at Ethan-
dun, and forced the Viking leader and 29
generals to the baptismal font, he had saved
Christendom from disaster. One heroic
story, however, has to die the death of
many a myth. Alfred was never a homeless
wanderer. His whole court and army were
with him in Athelney.
The general effect of the book is to make
it clear that the centuries before the Nor-
man Conquest are in every way as import-
ant as those which follow it. There is an
unbroken record of civilised life in Britain
running back to Caesar’s Roman invasion;
through Rome the British race is linked
with all the great civilisations of the past;
and, apart from Rome, a civilisation of at
least 15 centuries existed in prehistoric
Britain, and the Anglo-Saxons added, not
savagery, but another form of civilisation
to the main stream. As joint-heirs to all
that 140 generations of white men wrought
in a white man’s land, the book should
interest Australians.
DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
Amongst Those Not Present
Just as the poor man of sacred history
was glad enough to collect the crumbs that
fell from the rich man’s table, so is musical
Australia rejoicing over the fact that next
year’s opera company is to give us half a
dozen things that have not been performed
here before. Puccini, who is always a big
box-office draw because of his emotional
appeal, is to be represented by the three
one-act works of 1918 and his later “Turan-
dot,” which is taking old-world opera-
goers by storm. Mascagni, who has as yet
never managed to produce another “Caval-
leria Rusticana,” is to be given a chance
with his “Lodoletta,” a production of 1917.
But the programme is conspicuous for the
absence of three composers of varying
degrees of merit—Mozart, Delibes and
Strauss. No Covent Garden or Metro-
politan season is complete without at least
two of them, and no Continental season
would be worth discussing without the
whole three.
Of Mozart, there is nothing left to say.
“The Magic Flute” and “The Marriage of
Figaro” are known and loved wherever
opera is sung—except in our own country.
Of Richard Strauss there is much to be
said. Europe is still arguing about his
right to a seat in the Hall of the Gods.
There are those who would make him over-
seer of Valhalla, and there are those who
would not let him sweep its floors. Who-
ever is right, the fact remains that “Der
Rosenkavalier” has an established place in
the repertoire of every opera company of
note, and “Salome” and “Elektra” are not
far behind it. The third absentee, Delibes,
is loved on the Continent for his “Lakme”
because of its everflowing simple melodies
and its abundance of sly humor. It is 44
years since it first appeared; and Australia
still knows it not.
Also amongst those not present will be
the Russians Rimsky-Korsakov and Moss-
orgsky. The former, composer of 17 operas
besides numerous other standard works, has
achieved near-immortality in his “Sadko,”
“The Snow Maiden” and “Le Coq d’Or.”
Mossorgsky is responsible for “Boris God-
ounov.” This was written in 1874, and its
composer has been dead for almost 50 years.
As far as Australian operatic programmes
are concerned, he never lived.
We are to hear three of Wagner’s works.
Of course, the trouble with a Wagnerian
season is the cast. Australian Florence
Austral is the great Wagnerian soprano of
her day; but her steps have not yet been
turned homeward. The promised cast for
next year is indeed, so far as we know it,
wholly un-Australian. I deplore the absence
of the “Meistersinger” from the programme.
Turner, a prominent English critic of
reputed Australian birth, makes the bold
statement that the “Meistersinger” was the
only opera Wagner ever wrote, his only
operatic attempt in which the action and
the music are happily wedded.
Another conspicuous absentee is Mas-
senet. This distinguished Frenchman wrote
24 operas, two less than the output of the
energetic Verdi. He is famed far and wide
for his “Thais,” but the Continent knows
him almost equally well for his “Werther”
and “Herodiad”; it, is 15 years since he died
and time Australia began to realise that he
once lived.
One name especially I would like to have
seen on the list—that, of Gustav Holst,
England’s operatic hope. “The Perfect
Fool” and “At the Boar’s Head” have been
most favorably reviewed by world critics —
so favorably that it is not. unreasonable
that this part of the British Empire should
demand an early hearing of both works.
But, of course, the non-English-speaking
Italian cast, promised us puts Holst out of
reckoning as far as next year is concerned.
Perhaps his claims will be considered by
teaching schools like the Sydney Conserva-
torium when next they follow that excel-
lent idea, a student-cast operatic perform-
ance.
KEITH BARRY.
The Story
Any reader, any uncritical member of a
lending library, is the best judge of fiction
at its present point of saturation. This
reader Iras the ancient and only true touch-
stone: the story. If a lady writes an
actionless “novel” concerned solely with the
mind of an inexpressive child and its re-
actions to an inexpressive world, and
furthermore has the temerity to call her
book Your Cuckoo Sings by Kind (Knopf;
Dymock’s), to this ordinary reader (and
ultimate judge) the completed work will
be thin and negligible, however much the
critics have admired its workmanship.
Valentine Dobree’s first novel has had a
triumphant press in London and New
York; but that is, I think, because in those
cities workmanship has become the whole
touchstone instead of its half. This neglect
of the matter for the manner is the
historical reaction against over-production
and the consequent artistic over-training—
the saturation-point, in fact. The Romantics
fell silent a quarter of a century ago, when
the rich seed of the truth was planted. But
those seedlings called “exactness of presen-
tation” have been so thinned-out, so
caressed and tinkered with, that their flowers
are photographic and fibrous. Little
Christina Maynard, the cuckoo, is here in
sensitive detailed exactness, at times beauti-
ful exactness; but she has no story—she
means nothing more than her photograph,
and that can be seen at any moment in
any street in Australia, England or America.
Like the title of her photograph, she be-
comes rigid and affected in all this pother
of the artistic presentment of her ordinari-
ness.
There is a sort of a story in Now East,
Now West (Benn; Djunoek’s), but not
nearly enough of one to justify the charm
and skill of the treatment. Althea Goodall
drives her American husband from his
beloved New York to London. Here she
is bitterly disappointed—hurt in her abound-
ing American self-esteem —so, just when
George is beginning to like London, she
drives him back to New York. That is
all. The moral is presumably “Stay East,
or West; and, above all, don’t be an Ameri-
can woman.” All sorts of subtle magic are
expended on the Goodalls. You see them
un-Americanising themselves by the faintest
of degrees; you see the inarticulate business-
man George slowly blooming into a man of
parts in the soft English atmosphere of
spacious kindliness, see him finding an
imaginative ideal, being forced to throw
it away, and lapsing once more into the
single-minded maker of office-furniture.
Together with Susan Ertz, her creator, you
deplore, dislike, hate and finally despise
Althea. She has all the cheap faults of
the spoiled American woman; idle despite
her remorseless unproductive energy, cun-
ning', self-assertive and vain, she is not fit
to tie George’s shoe-laces. Yet she has him
in her pocket, forces him into English
society, forces him out of it again, runs
him here, there and everywhere, and still
retains him as an adoring lover to the end.
Every soul in the book is wondrously alive;
the pliant finish of the author’s craftsman-
ship is beyond praise. You turn the last
page full of admiration of the delightful
stunt, and thinking what an excellent book
it would be if only its story were worthy
of it.
For the combination of exactness of pre-
sentation, charm and the story, we must go
back to the Romantic manner, saddening
as that concession may be. Edith Whar-
ton’s Twilight Sleep (Appleton; Dymock’s)
is worth a score of photographs or stunts,
Pauline Manford, Nona, Lita, Dexter Man-
ford, Jim, “Exhibit A”—nothing could be
more vivid than the pulsating life of these
people. I feel them needing each other
hungry for each other’s friendly thoughts
and what little of wisdom the traffic of life
has granted. They come to me via the
charm of strict and simple prose, undei
the restraint the artist who created then
has imposed, and under the domination o
the splendid simplicity of her story. Whili
I turn the leaves I know no more of the
story than Dexter or poor old Exhibit A
than Pauline or Jim; but when I reach thi
penultimate chapter, every word, even. t(
the title, drops into its place in the argu
ment, and I am astounded and, in th
Romantic habit, thrilled. Yet I might hav
known, I tell myself, closing the bool
with a sigh of regret for the lost illusior
The illusion was so perfect, so complete
Little subtleties that were meant to b
missed until the climax brought them t
life; semi-tones of the writer’s voice, so t
speak; her sudden silences, sudden crueltie;
sudden warm charities —all placed in thei
sequence for me to feel their effect an
forget them, that I may be prepared ye
unprepared for the story’s apex, the clima
that calms all the storms and illuminates
all the tender cunning. Even writing about
it some of the magic illusion is creeping
back. Surely chapter xxx is one of the
best-written scenes in all modern fiction....
I think it must be.
HILARY LOFTING.
A Satchel of Books
The Tost Office, by Sir Evelyn Murray
(Putnam). The author, who has been
secretary to the Post Office of England since
1914, concentrates his work for the most
part upon the principal postal services, their
history, and the broad questions of policy
and administration which they involve.
Lost Kinncllan, by Agnes Mure Mackenzie
(Heinemann). The story centres in an old
Scotch home. In its telling the writer shows
familiarity with phases of the national
character, and carries the dramatic events
of the tale safely, through the dividing
channel between past prudery and modern
sex-license.
The Pink Horse, by S. McKelvie (Benn).
“ ‘Do you know what golf is?’ interrupted
the Padre, maliciously. ‘No,’ said the sud-
denly-arrested Colonel. ‘The pursuit of pale
pills by purple people,’ announced the Padre,
with a triumphant chuckle.” This quota-
tion serves to introduce a book which pur-
ports to be illustrative of humor in Anglo-
Indian society.
James! Don't lie. a Fool, by Edward Viv-
ian Timms (Cornstalk Co.). When Peter
Colburn, millionaire rubber magnate, of
Park-lane, set out. to arrange the matrimonial
destiny of his hopeful son James, he under-
took more than he had contemplated; for
James is a brisk, entertaining young man
who likes to handle liis own love affairs.
“Timms” is not a name to juggle with
like “Shakspeare,” but its young Australian
owner can write a novel that holds the jaded
attention of a class of casual readers whom
the immortal Bill would send to sleep.
British Drama League Library (Basil
Blackwell). This league was founded in
1919 to assist the development of the art
of the theatre and “to promote a right rela-
tion between drama and the life of the
community as a whole.” A reading com-
mittee selects from the plays submitted
such of the number as it deems wmrthy of
publication; and through the library thus
constituted, many aspirants reach the public
by a medium other than the presentation of
their works on the “commercial” stage.
Recent additions are “The Scarlet Lady,” by
John Hastings Turner; “The One Eternal
Thing,” by A. G. Berrisford; and “The Moon
Rides High,” by Herman Ould.
National Character, by Ernest Barker
(Methuen). The author, who is principal of
King’s College, London, has based this
volume on a series of lectures delivered by
him in the University of Glasgow, and in it
expresses such ideas as he had formed in
the teaching of history, particularly English
history and the civic life and national tradi-
tion of England. He believes it may be pos-
sib Ip to find in England and its empire
resources “such that we can still support a
great mass of population, at the same or a
higher standard of comfort, on the system of
individual management which has maintained
the national British characteristics of
energy, initiative and liberty.” His conception
oMndividualisrn is broad enough to embrace
voluntary co-operation and organisation pro-
vided they can be safeguarded from being
used to form great industrial unions or cor-
porations which may become a menace to
the sovereignty of the State. The book, excel-
lent of its kind, suffers from the weakness
of the student’s outlook on life; it offers
only a philosophy to men calling for a clearly
defined way out of the wilderness. Democ-
racy is not a council of sages to whom mere
theories appeal.
Contract Bridge, by R. F. Foster (Corn-
stalk). Whether contract bridge will oust
the popular auction bridge is largely a
temperamental question. It certainly offers
more room for the speculative player; on
the other hand, it robs the game of that
deliberative quality which gives a zest to
the player who has made himself master
of auction. As the author remarks, it gives
opportunity to the player “who depends more
on his judgment of the adversaries than upon
any hard and fast rules about the exact bid-
ding value of his own hand. Poor bidders
can hold good cards. They like to play, and
are not afraid to cut into a table against
players of supposedly superior skill, as they
know skill is not of much value if it is
shy of aces and kings.” The essential differ-
ence between contract and the parent game
lies in the scoring. Contract bridge has
attained a degree of popularity in Europe
and America that will doubtless be reflected
in Australia, and this handy and lucid expo-
sition of the game will be found of value
to all interested in bridge.
A Windjammer’s ’Prentice, by A. W.
Pearse (John Andrew). The author was the
founder of the N.S.W. Ancient Mariners’
League, and his book is of particular interest
to the skippers and sailors who can recall the
days when white wings took the place of the
smoke-boxes that traverse the seas to-day.
The book, written up from diaries kept over
many years, is full of interesting and
humorous experiences and is illustrated by
numerous pictures of old-time sailing craft.
If it serves no other purpose, it is valuable
for the contrast it presents between the
conditions of employment in the mercantile
marine to-day and those existing half a
century ago. Here is the Board of Trade
scale of provisions in those days: “ljlb. of
beef or IMb. of pork per day, 3 quarts of
water for all purposes, lib. of biscuits, |pt. of
peas on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, lib.
of rice on Saturday, -£oz. of tea and ioz. of
coffee per day and 12oz. of sugar per week.”
Not a word about raspberry jam or ham and
eggs! “Yet,” says the author, “the old
sailorman, ill-clad and badly fed as he was,
did very excellent work, and by some means
or—other best known to himself generally
contrived when allowed ashore to return on
board in a glorious state of inebriation. And
that on £2 10s. a month!” The employer
of to-day has a lot of trouble to thank the
employer of yesterday for.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An Epitaph.
She gave us many a laugh when she was
here,”
Was all they found to say when she was
dead.
N ° prayers were whispered round her quiet
bier,
No laurels twined about her poor, cold
head.
She was not greatly good, nor greatly wise;
Unly a poor, gay thing. Where hunger
dwells,
And where the sun forgot the gloomy skies,
felie laughed and danced, and shook her
motley bells.
She flung defiance in Death’s grisly face,
And flashed her pretty gauds, a born
coquette.
“She should have turned her mind to thoughts
of grace;
She was not fit to die,” they said. And
yet—
Methinks they’ll miss those merry, dancing
feet
Down in the lanes where skies are drab
and drear,
And harken for their patter down the
street—
Those feet that never stayed through cold
or fear.
And what if Christ should hold that tribute
dear—
“ She gave us many a laugh when she was
here”?
VICTORIA.
M. C. POTTER.
The City.
The city’s a painted harlot with a smile upon
her face,
And she wears the streets, her garments,
with an air of careless grace;
Some are old and badly tattered, others silk
and Spanish lace.
I hate • her for a slattern when the cruel
w'hite light of day
Marks her face deep-lined and haggard,
where the rouge and powder lay;
And I turn aside with loathing when she
nods and goes her way.
But when I hear her calling, then I keep a
rendezvous
With the ardor of a lover for a passion
that is new,
And with night my ill-forebodings to the
winds of chance I strew 1 .
Her hair is touched with star-dust and her
lips are red with wine,
M hile her eyes are soft with pleading of
a love that few decline,
Though her kiss is cold and bitter as the
siren-haunted brine.
She drains the cup of beauty w 7 ith a mad
rose-flinging crowd;
But the lees are bitter drinking, though the
eyes of Youth are proud,
And they sing of love not heeding, that for
Age Death weaves a shroud.
When stars are slowly fading and the winds
of Dawn make moan,
When the wine-cups all are empty and the
roysterers are gone,
Then I steal away and leave her, sad with
dreaming, and alone.
N.S.W.

The Outsider.
I h** ve looked on at life so long, so long!
The lesser loves and hates have passed me
by
As I were not. The shudder and the sigh.
The whispering and the laughter, ever throng
About me, and avoid. They call me strong
VY ho never pause the weakness to descry
Which else I had not hidden; they defy
The thing I am not, passionless, and wrong
My half-formed ideals till they shrink anil
fade.
I have been standing by the outer gate
Until the very sweetness of a song
Has terrors for me, and I am afraid
To enter. I have found this truth too late;
I have looked on at life too long, too
long.

ETHEL DAVIES.
Solace.
About my quiet days I cast
Imagining and the gold-fire
Song sheds, and from the shining past
I draw, as though my heart's desire
Had been fulfilled, old memories glad
And lost delight that once I had.
All the green peace about me brings
Strange imagery, and I behold
Strangely as though my soul had wings,
Islands of faery, queens in g01d....
I watch in Avalon of dream
A red ship pass with sails agleam.
All amid gracious things I go—
Green-showered trees with lakes of light
Quivering beneath them, blue hills’ glow
Over blue Avaters, and the bright
Days pass in gold and azure blent....
I who asked all once go content.

Earth’s Little Folk.
Yesternight, as eerily
Crept the moon o’er field and wood,
Nothing stirred except the sea,
Voicing strange disquietude.
In my home the housefolk slept;
Round about it slept the flowers;
Only ticked a clock that kept
Watch and ward upon the hours.
O’er my roof a gum-tree threw
Shadows, such as moonlight weaves;
Scarcely could I hear the dew
Dripping softly from its leaves.
All the world, in silence drowned,
r Slept unstirred by bird or breeze;
Through my window came no sound
Save the dirge of distant seas.
Only dirging combers broke
On far rocks and sands of white
Till Earth’s Little Folk awoke
In the middle of the night.
When Earth’s Little Folk awoke
And their chorus rippling ran,
Silence in her mystic cloak
Stole away, and song began.
As when elves at midnight meet
Merry-mooded in some glade.
Minstrelsy, subdued and sweet,
Sweet beyond all else, they made.
While my clock kept watch and ward
Over Time’s unceasing flight,
Up from garden, up from sward,
Rose their music through the night.
Voicing nature, green and gay—-
Life afoot and joy awing—-
Minstrels clad in brown were they,
Chirruping, all chirruping.
Care they knew not, knew not grief,
As they chorused, one and all—
Minstrels under blade and leaf
Making midnight lyrical.
As I watched the moon down creep
Much I thanked that midnight throng,
Lullabying me to sleep
With the sweetness of their song.
Thus, while combers dirging broke
On far shores and sands of white,
When Earth’s Little Folk awoke
Music moved through yesternight.

Frost.
The young fire puts a yellow finger forth
So cautiously that one squat shadow grins
Gargoyle-derision, with discolored fang
And loose-lipped mouth that ever, satyr-wise,
Savors some after-relish of old sins
Silenus knew. Draw close! Night has a
tang
That wakens dreams of the grey bitter North.
Though summer seas are blue within your
eyes.
The flames are singing such an old, strange
song
The while they carve their crimson castle
walls.
It whispers, whispers to the blood of me
lake something heard or dreamed age-long
ago:
A battle chant in ruddy Viking halls;
The far surge of an ice-imprisoned sea;
Lost splendor and intolerable wrong—
All sieged Valhalla’s thunder-throated woe.
The embers darken and the red caves fall.
Outside the chill stars glitter, icy-sere,
And white Death lays one frozen tentacle
Over earth’s heart in sign of sovranty,
A little wind sobs once, and dies with fear
Of stillness suddenly grown terrible.
Only your eyes, dear heart, laugh, warm
with all
The sapphire wonder of the summer sea.
QUEENSLAND.
J. HOLLOWAY.
The Happy House.
Shyly behind stone walls it stands,
Knee-deep among its flowers;
Yellow and pink and azure blue
’Midst almond-blossom showers.
Around the cheery red-flagged paths
A merry fountain plays ;
Each sparkling bead for me enshrines
A memory of glad days.
Violas to the violets make
Their sweetest overtures,
And poppies for the primrose fly
Their most entrancing lures.
When day dies on a twilight wind
The laughing house is still,
And flowers and trees expectant stand
Waiting the high moon’s will.
Her fingers stir the lily leaves;
On grassy lawns her feet
Like twinkling silver mark the ring
Where the garden faery meet.
And who shall see them dancing there—
Dryad and gnome and Pan—
Shall go through all the following years
A happy dreaming man.
And when the russet dawn proclaims
The Sun’s first golden gleam
The eyes of the fair house smile out,
Gold-dusted with its dreams.

A NATIONALIST PROGRAMME
SO FAR AS IT GOES.
Thomas R. Bavin, who leads the anti-Com-
munist forces in N.S.W., has announced his
policy; and on the whole this paper can
speak well of it. At any rate, it isn’t dotted
over with promises of the impossible, and
it isn t strewn with glaring and obvious lies;
and these negative virtues now count for a
good deal in N.S.W. politics. The policy
and the reputation of the man behind it,
moreover, carry assurance of an era of clean,
honest government. At the same time it
looks like timid and unenterprising govern-
ment, and there are shibboleths that might
well be left out as old and stale.
* * * *
The Upper House reform plank, on which
Ueorge Reid used to fight elections in pre-
Federation days, makes its familiar re-
appearance, and as tlre Upper House was
never so badly in need of reform, the
job is probably to be taken seriously at last.
But it would have been far more satis-
factory if the promise of a Council which
will be elective and democratic and yet not
a mere duplicate of the Assembly had been
accompanied by plans and specifications.
1 here is no such serious difficulty about
the finding ot a scheme that any party
should be still wandering in a maze of
doubt and a jungle of hesitation. The
undertaking to suspend the disgraceful
Sydney Council and hold an inquiry into
its doings is a cause for unqualified satis-
faction. An assurance that the Greater
Sydney Council, which is to take its place
after a spell of Commissioner rule, will be
so constructed that it won’t by any chance
become the old iniquity writ large would
also have been welcome. As regards the
promise to subdivide large estates, a small
estate, when it is too far from a decent
town and an available port, hasn’t proved
itself much of a proposition. An opening-
presents itself for any political leader who
talks decentralisation, as almost every one
does, to say specifically that it is his ambi-
tion to connect every port which is worth
calling a port by rail with its hinterland if
the same is worth calling a hinterland, and
to do all that lies in his power to foster
the growth of a city there. The prospective
Bavin Government is no more definite as
yet on the matter of neglected ports than
the retrospective Fuller Government was.

The 44-hours-per-week principle is to
stand whether the State can afford it or
not. As an obvious matter of fact, the
State is pathetically unable to afford it,
especially when it exists in company with
workmen’s insurance, child endowment and
the rural basic wage. The anticipated
closure of the Broken Hill Prop, and other
mines is only one of the evidences. It might
be unpopular to say now that 44 hours is
a riotous luxury, but it will cease to be
unpopular one of these days, when it is
realised that more work is better than less
food. An attempt to combine the highest
cost of living, the biggest mass of imports
(which are bad for local industry), the
biggest loans and the shortest working
hours is aiming at the impossible. A bold
leader would say so—and make friends
by doing it. The Fair Rents Act is to
continue without the proviso about keep-
ing rents down to the 1915 level. In appa-
rent recognition that the famine in houses-
to-let will likewise continue, the Nationalist
leader promises to advance up to 90 per
cent, of the cost of the boom-price home
with which the home-seeker burdens him-
self, often reluctantly and under duress.
Nobody of intelligence imagines that a
domestic shack run up under conditions of
dear land, dear materials, short hours and
limitation oi human energy is a safe security
with a mere 10 per cent, margin, or wholly
safe with a 25 per cent, margin, but the
position is fraught with complications—said
complications being, in truth, mostly doubts
whether honesty is the best policy at the
moment; whether, in short, the community
hasn’t been corrupted so much that it would
not go straight if it was asked to. Under
much the same influences the indus-
trial arbitration system is to continue,
though whether awards are to be observed
any better in the future than in the past
is left in doubt.
No Nationalist Ministry can help being
a financial improvement on the present con-
glomeration, but T. R. Bavin is due for an
inheritance of trouble. N. S. Wales is so
littered over with the foundations and
skeletons of public works and public jobs
and shirks that a loan expenditure of
£10,000,000 per annum is considered neces-
sary for a considerable time ahead in order
to bring them to the interest-paying stage.
As many of them will never reach that
stage it is likely that a policy of abandon-
ment would be cheapest in many cases, and
that policy may be forced on any kind of
Government that the State may acquire,
just as it was in Queensland, by the un-
findableness of the annual £10,000,000. The
commitments, huge as they are, don’t in-
clude the first beginnings of a plan for turn-
ing neglected ports to account, and under
the programme which the Nationalist leader
outlines anything of the sort recedes again
into the future. All the same, it is the
plain duty of every patriot to support
Bavin, and in a secondary way his associate
Buttenshaw. They mean well and have
room for improvement, while the rival
crowd means as badly as it knows how and
invents new and uncouth sins as it goes
along. Even its kerosene-tin ballot-box is
never by any chance free from suspicion,
which amounts to certainty nine times out
of ten.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
John T. Liang, Premier and Gold-brick
Merchant.
At Auburn (N.S.W.) two years ago J. T.
Lang, Labor-leader and land-agent, de-
livered a policy speech which was a
triumph of the art of the gold-brick
merchant. The Fullek Government, he
said, had callously abandoned “the
arrangement under which men could be-
come settlers on payment of a small de-
posit.” He, if given the opportunity, would
“effect the settlement of every qualified
applicant who wants to go on the land,”
and if London was unwilling to furnish the
money for, say, “20,000 prospective settlers,”
he would get it from New York. Farmers
“all over the country” were “clamoring for
relief from excessive Government railway
charges.” The relief would be given if he
became Premier—he would “appreciably”
reduce freight rates and second-class fares.
Fuller, instead of lowering taxation, had
“enormously increased” it, and “audaciously
declared that Labor intended to impose
additional burdens.” Labor would “do no
such thing”—Labor would, instead, “lighten”
the load “at once.” Labor would also
bring down tramway fares and build wooden
dwellings at, a great rate—“a scheme which
will give a needed impetus to the timber
industry and offer a quicker solution of
the housing problem than anything yet
attempted.”
Last week the gentleman delivered
another policy speech, this time as
Premier. During the intervening two years
he forgot all about the wooden houses, and
the 20,000 new settlers, and the reduced
fares and freight rates and taxes. Instead
of lowering the railway charges he made
them stiffer, and he raised the income-tax
to such an extent that an additional
£2,385,000 —practically 50 p.c.—was extorted
last year. Moreover, for reasons wholly dis-
creditable to him, he alienated the best
elements in his party, 24 members of which
renounced his leadership, declaring him a
traitor, a dictator and a repudiator of the
decisions of the Federal conference. Yet
in bragging of his “record,” he used the
words “No man can say that I fail to keep
my promises.” It says little for the
crowd’s sense of humor that there was no
roar of laughter.
There is drought in N. S. Wales, and,
owing to Lang legislation and the fall in
the price of metals, three Broken Hill mines,
if not more, are about to close down. The
Railway Commissioners report a deficiency
of £451,600 and urge the necessity for still
higher fares and freight rates; though the
additional charges imposed in violation of
Lang’s pledge were estimated to yield
£905,000 for the full year, the cost of
“recent legislation” could not be overtaken,
nor can it be unless the users of the rail-
ways are smitten again. Minahan, M.L.A.,
the only man in the old Labor party who
knew anything about industry on the finan-
cial side, says the child-endowment tax—
-3 p.c. on the total of wages and salaries—
is “partly ruining industry” and is opposing
the author of the tax in his own constituency
in the hope of preventing the worst. It is
assuredly a time for husbanding resources,
but the Premier is heedless of warnings and
in his methods utterly reckless. All he
can think of is to make his shaky position
secure by offering huge political bribes. So,
while it is yet uncertain whether the crude
child-endowment scheme will work, he has
promised to increase the weekly payments
and extend them to hundreds of thousands
of electors not now included. This means
that the tax on wages sheets will be 64 per
cent., as in the original measure, though it
is doubtful if even 8 per cent, will suffice.
More widows’ pensions are also promised,
together with unemployed insurance, two
State coalmines, “payment for annual holi-
days and public holidays,” and (instead of
the wooden houses) 90 p.c. advances to
home-builders. Then there are to be State
wireless stations, more irrigation works, “a
State-wide scheme of fodder conservation”
and stacks of new railways.
It is a crazy programme for a country
which is to a large extent living on foreign
loans. Since it could not be financed other-
wise, it would necessitate more (and dearer)
foreign loans. Yet foreign loans were not
even mentioned in the foolish speech.

Thank You, Mr. McCormack.
For 13 years it has been increasingly
difficult to decide whether the State owned
the Queensland railways or whether the
railway men owned the State. A railway
system which used to be the most solvent
in the Commonwealth has made vast and
continuous losses, £1,750,000 in a year being
not uncommon, and the more money they
consumed the more they deteriorated. They
became a scene of dirt, disorder, disrepair,
unpunctuality and complete disregard of
discipline. The demoralisation would have
been checked long ago if a Government had
been cheerfully prepared to accept loss of
office as one of the chances of the game.
Till now Queensland has not had such a
Government; and it is for citizens to ask
themselves why. If it is because Govern-
ments have been afraid to speak the truth
to their constituents; if it is because Gov-
ernments have been buying votes and office
with railway billets, and so on; if it is (to
upend that proposition) because the com-
munity has sold its votes for billets, etc.,
then democracy is a failure, and its friends
must rush to save it, no matter what party
suffers in the process. No party that lives
ty corruption can possibly be democratic.
The annual row at certain North Queens-
land ports, which began the recent trouble,
is a fair sample of the tendency of a section
of Queensland labor to fly off the handle.
A large capacity for being wronged and
aggrieved is an unlucky asset, and when
a large number in a community have it, it
is liable to be a calamity. Thirty-four
years ago an emigration scheme was organ-
ised by Queensland unionists. A half-breed
South American Government, which thought
the Australian settlers would be a source
of strength, came down with a handsome
offer of 450,000 acres of land, local self-
government, a period of exemption from
military service and from taxation, even
including exemption from import duties.
The emigrants were all “selected,” they all
had a little money (that was a sine qua
non) and they started about 240 strong to
begin with, leaving their cares behind them.
There were no capitalists to quarrel with!
but they quarrelled so fiercely with their
own local Administration, and with each
other, and every man with himself and
every woman with her neighbor, that the
big enterprise came to nothing or to very
little. The case suggests that the griev-
ance habit is one of long-standing, especi-
ally in the North—like the other habit
which so many Australians develop of hav-
ing millions left to them by mysterious
corpses in foreign parts.
The question is whether the grievance
habit is worth encouraging—or whether it
is not better worth carefully watching and
promptly suppressing on appearance. The
Queenslander is in the bulk such a good
fellow, as well as such a good Australian,
that a large capacity for having a grouch
doesn’t, seem really to belong to him.

The Blundering Employer.
As soon as the Queensland industrial
trouble has been cleaned up, the employers
of Australia should see about establishing
some sort of authority to protect their
general body from the blundering and
ignorant and bad-dispositioned fools among
them. There are a thousand things the
employer is legally entitled to do which he
should not do; and The Bulletin is not
at all sure that some of those things were
not done at South Johnstone. It may be
answered that an employer has the right
to conduct his business in his own way
within the law. He hasn’t. If his way of
conducting it is likely to lead to trouble,
and if that trouble is likely to in-
volve hundreds or perhaps hundreds
of thousands of people, then the general
body of employers are entitled to
take a hand in the matter. Let some
authority be created by the employers, and
let that authority be available for consul-
tation when an employer is threatened with
trouble; then its certificate that the em-
ployer concerned handled the situation
aright must have a great influence in at
least preventing the spread of a strike. At
present, employers are in effect called upon
to support the cause of one of their number
who may be a blundering fool. The com-
munity should be protected against that.

A Thirsty Prime Minister.
It was once stated that the Bruce-Page
Ministry had 32 Royal Commissions inquir-
ing into things, but that was a while ago.
Now it is a familiar saying that Bruce
can invent a new commission every two
days, and that Page can talk for two hours
on anything and say next to nothing. The
latest effort has been the appointment of
five little-known persons to listen to the
views of 500 more or less known persons on
child endowment, and prepare a report
which should run to 1500 pages and be
ready by 1935. The “reference” says the
five are to consider (1) child endowment
generally; (2) the same “with particular
reference to its social and economic effects”;
(3) if the thing is wanted at all; (4) how
to do it; (5) its relation to “the interests
of the wage-earner, of industry generally
and of the community”; (6) its bearing
upon people with fixed wages, unfixed wages
and no wages, and on non-workers; (7) the
income-limit or the no-income-limit of the
recipient ; (8) the way to find the money—
from public revenue, or industry, or from
which, or where, or both, or some of each,
and what proportion of each; (9) the
method of administration—in other words,
how to do it over again; (10) the cost, in-
cluding various things; (11) the legal aspect
of the case, if any; (12) any matters of
public interest which may arise through
child endowment, or subsequent to it and
apparently due to it, and attached or hang-
ing on to it, or dragging behind it, or run-
ning alongside, or somewhere ini the vicinity.
When the wonderful word-spinner de-
mands information on all these points, The
Bulletin can’t help asking (1) on what
point, if any, does he possess information
already; and (2) does a Prime Minister get
his job because of his thirst for information
or because it is currently reported that he
is a whole mine-full of information already?

The Occupation of Australia.
The Geneva Population Conference may
not produce much record of achievement,
but it has at least given the French ex-
Minister Albert Thomas, now secretary of
the International Labor Office, an oppor-
tunity to make remarks about White Aus-
tralia, and these may lead to an increasing
flow of observations later on. In fact, the
supply of comment may grow to alarming
proportions. Hostile statements have been
made about the effrontery of the distin-
guished Frenchman in speaking as he did,
but the fact remains that he did speak, was
heard by an influential audience, and was
very widely reported. The situation has to
be faced; and these are some of its
aspects:—
A general principle is recognised that a
country belongs to the people who occupy it.
Man in the bulk is the freeholder of the
globe, and man in a tribal sense is a tenant,
whose moral claim on his premises is of
greater or less value according to circum-
stances, though his capacity for holding the
premises is the best claim in every circum-


stance. The tenant’s moral claim is recog-
nised as better if he puts the property to
good use and keeps it in repair.
The present owners’ right to Australia
rests on the fact that they took it from
previous proprietors who occupied it in a
very sketchy way and didn’t know how to
hold it. A sort of intermediate claimant
named Schnapps, who wore wide pants and
hailed from. Amsterdam, was ruled out
because he effected no occupation at all. As
regards a great part of the continent, the
Australian hasn’t done much more than
Mk. Schnapps who hailed from Amster-
dam.
The title-deeds by which Australia is held
aren’t old enough to command much respect
merely by reason of their age. Those of
Maoriland are even younger, but they are
strengthened by a far better diffused system
of occupation. A moderate amount of settle-
ment goes a long way, provided it is spread
out so as to indicate a resolve to take com-
plete possession. Four or five cities in a
corner indicate only a firm resolution to
make a good claim to that corner.
The position of a community which dog-
in-the-mangers a great and fairly habitable
area is so unusual at this late and crowded
date that new precedents are always liable
to be made. And in this case there are com-
plications. One is that, despite some feeble
pretence of railway construction, the North
and North-West look quite as much like
being abandoned as settled.
Albert Thomas may be an intrusive
nuisance; but his position and his widely-
reported remarks add to our danger. There
is only one way of meeting and overcoming
it; and that is by actual occupation. This
means treating the completion of the Trans-
continental railway as an urgent job—the
Commonwealth’s most urgent job—to begin
with.
* __
The Timber Industry.
The Australian timber industry to-day is
not the profitable thing it was a few years
ago, and its prospects are darkly clouded.
Apathetic Governments which have per-
mitted the wholesale dumping of American
Oregon in this country, and the use of that
timber in place of Australian hardwoods, are
mainly responsible for the gloom. With the
foreigners picking the plums out of the
industry, competition is keen for what little
is left, and prices are cut to the bone.
The old-established wholesale man is har-
assed by the kerbstone operator, whose
stock-in-trade is a notebook and pencil. The
sawmiller, too, is in a most unsatisfactory
position. The idea that there are sovereigns
in saplings and that a “tin pot” sawmill is
a mint is prevalent everywhere; sawmillers
spring up like mushrooms in consequence.
They carry on for a few months, doing
much harm by way of price-cutting, and
then slink out of the business, wiser if
poorer men.
The N. S. Wales Sawmillers’ Association,
which has spent much money in endeavor-
ing to place this branch of the industry on
a better footing, has not received the sup-
port due to it. Dozens of millers along
the timber belt refuse to subscribe to the
association, yet nonchalantly pocket those
benefits in the form of increased prices for
sawn timber for which the association has
battled. The new Workers’ Compensation
law also operated adversely; but those in
the business at least give credit to Lang for
an increase of 2s. per hundred super feet in
the price of sawn timber—granted almost
immediately after the compensation came
into effect. Still, the mere passing on of
imposts will not permanently benefit the
industry, which will continue to suffer until
the duty on foreign timbers is lifted sub-
stantially.
Labor and Government.
The inherent defect of the Labor move-
ment, politically considered, is that it really
isn’t political at all. It is industrial. When
it says to itself that every day and in every
way it is more and more political, and
pushes along that line till it finds itself
toying with the reins of government, it gets
into much the same position as a union
secretary who is also the employer of the
members of his union.
Nevertheless, it must either govern or let
some outsider do the governing. Lang, of
N. S. Wales, leaves it to the outsiders. He
doesn’t even trouble to put up a colorable
imitation of governing. McCormack, of
Bananaland, has taken the other tack, and
all the Labor leaders who are not in his
Parliament —and some that are—are invit-
ing the proletariat to chuck the dirty black
scab so far outside the pale that the splash
won’t be heard. He is no longer a class-
conscious comrade, and he grinds the iron
heel of a ruthless despotism upon the faces
of the poor.
Political history is full of instances of
Labor men who have had to scrap some of
their Labor theories when in office. Holman
and Hughes in Australia, Seddon in Maori-
land. Briand in France— he smashed a rail-
wav strike bv conscripting all the strikers—
and Ramsay M\cdonald and Philip Snow-
den in England occur to the mind. Mac-
donald didn’t have a long spin, but nowa-
days he gets more cheers from the Tory
benches than from his own crowd, while
Snowden —erstwhile the “sea-green incor-
ruptible” of British Socialism—now writes
articles for staid and respectable magazines
about the virtues of industry, co-operation
and thrift.
The truth seems to be that a Labor man
can’t honestly tackle the job of responsible
government and remain a Labor man very
long. In the language of the moment, he
has sooner or later got to scab on either
“the movement” or the country—just as
that man who was both employer and
union-secretary would inevitably sooner or
later find himself saddled with an anomaly.
Are We Becoming a Nation of Rogues?
“T. Jasper” : We have heard a great deal
about the financial rocks on which our ship
of State will founder if we persist in our
present borrowing habits, but we have heard
surprisingly little about the spiritual de-
cadence that is a consequence of long-con-
tinued Micawberism.
The people, particularly the people of the
big cities, have become corrupted with loan
money. We have long passed that stage
where borrowing was a business necessity,
and we now borrow, to put it bluntly, that,
we may escape work. In literature the indi-
vidual who borrows to avoid toil is usually
amiable and harmless; in real life he is a
rogue. And it behoves us to seriously con-
sider whether we are not becoming a nation
of rogues. Some of the evidence is cer-
tainly alarming, and indicates a definite
decay of honesty and national character.
Take, for example, the figures relating to
wharf pillaging. These indicate that Aus-
tralians are easily the world’s champion pil-
ferers of ship cargoes. Not a nice thing to
reflect upon, these figures, but they were
taken by most people as a matter of course.
Which only serves to show how far we have
strayed from the path of probity.
Then consider the administration of Aus-
tralia’s greatest city. Allegations of graft
in connection with Sydney’s civic concerns
have become almost a daily occurrence.
Aldermen have now got to the point of
declaring openly their intention of attend-
ing to their friends’ interests at the expense
of the community. What is most damnable,
however, is the attitude of city dwellers
towards these things. Instead of great meet-
ings of protest and a grim determination
to hound the city pillagers from public life,
all one finds is a general attitude of cynical
acceptance.
To go higher up, J. T. Lang is travelling
about the State making the most lavish
promises ever made to a body of electors.
If we had the habit of thinking honestly.
J. T. Lang would be laughed or hooted off
the platform; actually he is applauded. We
are willing to be bribed, and hang the con-
sequences!
All of which serves to indicate spiritual
decadence on a large scale. And the cause
thereof is not a lack of religion but a super-
abundance of loan money.

The Funeral March of the T.P.
Financier.
Melbourne is harvesting its bitter fruits
of T.P. finance. According to report, 120
policemen are doing nothing else beyond
serving summonses in connection with cash-
order accounts. All but a very few of these
orders are taken out by men and women
to procure luxuries they cannot afford at
the moment and probably never will be
able to afford. It is well that a vivid spot-
light has been turned on this ugly menace
to sane living.
The evil has been making its malignant
penetration through a good many years. So
far back as 1913 a bill was introduced in the
Vic. Parliament designed to cut out the
growth. Robert McGregor was the sponsor
of the measure, which, however, never got
beyond its second reading. He produced
an account which showed a return of 234
p.c. to one of the vampire cash-order cos.
in Melbourne. Not all of it was extracted
—directly, at any rate—from the holders of
the orders; some of it was taken in com-
mission from the traders to whom the orders
were presented. The evil thus cuts two
ways: it lures the foolish optimist who is
prepared to pledge the wages of a more or
less precarious future for present enjoyments
and luxuries, and it levies tribute on the
tradesmen who cash these orders, under
cover of the increased trade they bring.
The introducer of the Vic. bill quoted the
case of a tradesman who by dealing in these
orders increased his. turnover more than
threefold, yet found that, instead of his
business becoming more profitable, it was
less so. He caused his auditor to investi-
gate the shrinkage, and that financial analyst
traced it to the cash-order sales, on which a
commission of 15 p.c. had been allowed to
the operating cos. Five years later, 1918,
the Commonwealth Statistician produced to
an Inter-State Commission a calculation
showing that “the effective annual rate
obtained by the cash-order cos. on the
amounts actually advanced ranged from 215
per cent, to 499 per cent.”
The cash-order vulture disguised in the
feathers of the dove pipes plaintively that
the system, so far from being an injury to
the community, has been a blessing to it.
Writes one advocate: “It has proved a great
boon to thousands who through sickness or
unemployment of the bread-winner require
temporary financial assistance at a low fixed
rate of interest.” Doubtless out of modesty
he refrains from any actuarial analysis of
the incidence of these philanthropic
advances. Cant is a poor umbrella to
shelter under. Cash-order cos. are not out
to succor the needy or console the sick;
their interest is interest—and lots of it.
Whatever pity can be squeezed out of
obvious folly goes to the optimist who
pawns the uncertain wages of to-morrow for
the present pleasure of fine faring—and
supports a horde of expensive non-producers
in the process.

The Go-Getter’s Trade.
“Company Secretary”: The par. on
“suits to rectify a Register” (B. l/9/’27) is
timely and to the point, but there is a
better plan than the establishment of an-
other Government Office for examining and
hall-marking prospectuses. The proper
crowd for the job would consist of the com-
mittee of the Stock Exchange in collabora-
tion with one or all of the councils of the
various accountancy institutes, or with
selected representatives of all of them, the
whole body having the right to call in out-
side evidence and the promoters having
the right to be heard and to produce their
own experts and authorities. Fees would
be in proportion to the work involved. Why
the public bodies mentioned have not
moved along these lines ages ago is beyond
comprehension. They are supposed to be
the public guardians, and yet when it is in
their power to check the whole dirty busi-
ness of company-promotion swindles they
sit back and do absolutely nothing, while,
as in one notorious case, a typewriter sales-
man and a whisky traveller set up a
luxurious suite of offices, and on the one
hand advise the public as to its invest-
ments and on the other hand find money
for people with “propositions.”
The average Public Service man is the
last type of individual who should be en-
trusted with the prospectus-analysing job.
A public servant is necessarily brought up
under stereotyped regulations which do not
allow any play for imagination or initiative,
the two factors that are absolutely essential
in men who are to deal competently with
new flotations and new ideas.
Knowing something of the general
method adopted in The Bulletin Office
for dealing with these matters, I have no
hesitation in saying that the opinions ex-
pressed in the “Wild Cat Column” and in
the “Wild Cat” Monthly are absolutely
honest and accurate, especially so when one
bears in mind the impossibility of calling
on every company secretary and promoter
for an explanation of anything that appears
obscure in a balance-sheet, or prospectus.
But unfortunately there are others who
combine the peddling of advice to pro-
moters 'with criticism of prospectuses. The
injustice and danger of this dual function
have been amply, illustrated.
If one were dealing wfith an unbiased
committee which was going to get its fees
in any case, there would be no inducement
to levy financial blackmail even if all the
members of the committee were suddenly
prepared to turn blackguard. Further, no
one man can possibly, no matter how clever
or knowledgeable he be, be competent to
give a fair opinion of every one of the in-
finitely varied propositions that company
promoters have to put forward. That is
where a Public Service department would
fall down on the job. The department
should have a Braddon or a Sheldon at
its head, and others of only slighter lesser
ability on its staff. Wild horses could not
attract such men to the Public Service, and
the latter could never breed them.
It may be said that the work involved
would occupy the whole time of the com-
mittee. Certainly if every prospectus now
issued were to be examined in detail and
be made the subject of evidence for and
against, a very large amount of time would
be required and a very large staff. But the
possession by the promoters of the know-
ledge that, in order to get a certificate the
prospectus has got to make out a complete
and unassailable case, would undoubtedly
kill about 75 p.c. of the schemes at birth
and reduce the work enormously. There
would, of course, be considerable difficulty
in fixing the fees to be paid, but promoters
would have to remember that the certificate
would be an invaluable document for which
it. would be worth paying a high price.
There should, however, be some means of
enabling a poor man to get a hearing. In
such a case the Crown might pay the neces-
sary fees —to be recovered later on flotation
of the company—on the grounds that the
whole system is going to save an immense
amount of time and money by reducing
the work of the Equity Court later on.

Parrots.
“Birdlime” : There is a panicky feeling in
South Australia. Diagnosis of the complaint
is simple, the symptoms being wild talk of
impending economic crisis, and usually the
patient is found on the suburban political
platform or at a board meeting. We are
told that Australia is living beyond her
means, that our debt is becoming oppres-
sive, and that people must economise and
“produce, produce, produce.” But to whom
are these people offering their warnings?
If to the man in the street, trying to sup-
port his wife and family on a bread-line
wage, the warning to economise is both
absurd and futile. If he is tempted to buy
articles on credit, he is merely availing him-
self of the opportunity to use the terms
offered by the vendor. It may be good or
bad for him, but so long as favorable terms
are offering, he is not going to be bothered
by any theory on inflation of credit.
Criticism could be directed ad lib. on
matters of waste and inefficiency, but the
parrot should direct his attack in the right
place. We are told by economists that the
banks are the custodians of credit, the most
far-reaching factor in the economic struc-
ture of to-day. If a bank says “No!” to
applicants for credit, a curtailment is the
result, volume of business falls, and the
public must do without the commodity’’.
The implication, then, that we are living
too luxuriously reflects discredit on those
entrusted with the handling of credit. While
business people are given accommodation
to import motors and expensive fabrics
they will sell on such terms as will bring
them the best return. Why, then, do not
these people who take seats on boards of
finance companies, etc., attack themselves
and the banks for the state of affairs if it
is wrong?. All the parrots in suburban halls
cannot deter one person from buying a
piano or a motor if the deposit is avail-
able and a hire agreement is pushed at
him to sign.
By Air to Europe.
The closer linking-up of Australia and
Maoriland with Britain and other units ol
the empire is heralded by the investigations
of a special mission from the British Air
Ministry. Its object is to inquire into the
conditions, meteorological and general, in
Australasia, with a view to establishing an
airship route in connection with the British
scheme for quicker inter-communication
between Britain and the dominions, and to
select, sites for airship bases. Before com-
ing this way, the mission carried out a
similar task in South Africa, where siies for
bases and mooring masts have been selected,
and these, with others under construction in
Egypt, will form connecting links in the
Australia-Maoriland route. The estimated
time for the journey is 11 days, and Group-
Captain Fellowes, who is leader of the
mission, anticipates preliminary flights in
1930.
The scheme, which not so long since
would have aroused derision, seems already
assured of success, and if the Bruce-Page
Government, which invited the mission to
Australia, accepts its report, Australians
may be taking the air route to Europe
inside five years. The Air Ministry has
already issued some particulars of two new
dirigibles it has in view. These will lift
150 tons, thus making possible a very con-
siderable passenger traffic.
The matter of the Australian contribu-
tion to the cost is bound to produce some
hard thinking in our present circumstances;
but since Britain is putting down £1,750,000
for a beginning, this country’s contribution
should not be beyond its powers.
♦
The Gloom of the Commigrant.
Really the state of Queensland is getting
serious; under the influence of their humor-
less commigrant or pommunist leaders, they
are forgetting how to laugh. If they hadn’t
lost that good Australian virtue, they
wouldn’t—couldn’t —do such ridiculous
things in such a deadly earnest fashion.
Take the case of the Innisfail cake. The
annual ball in aid of the hospital was to be
held in Innisfail on Monday night. The
district was canvassed for subscriptions and
contributions to the supper, and anything
that could be. raffled was very welcome. A
cook at South Johnstone (cooking for scabs
he was, of course) sent in a cake. The
strikers, hearing of this, notified the com-
mittee that it must be returned to its scab
maker, otherwise the dance would be
declared “black,” along with all who attended.
The committee gritted its teeth and, waving
the flag of freedom, resolved to carry on,
wherefore the hall was actually picketed
and an attempt made to take the names of
those going into the place. Police protec-
tion was called up; notwithstanding which
car drivers with one or two exceptions re-
fused to take people to the dance.
By this time, of course, the cake was
quite forgotten; and the community was
divided into two lots, both pushing their
chests out and thinking of themselves as
heroes —the one daring the silvertail and
the plutycrat and the money power all
combined to Come On; the other spurning
the threats of the proletariat and resolved
to chance the lamp-post and the pistol for
the sake of freedom. And all over a cake
sent in for a charity raffle. If they could
only get rid of their pommunist influences,
the good Australians among them would
laugh at both parties and tell them to get
work.

Dope.
Hollywood’s producers have shown the
U. S. Fleet receiving the surrender of the
enemy battleships at Scapa Flow. Their war
pictures move the more intelligent of the
American press and periodicals to acid com-
ment. But the Babbitt audiences know no
better than the Babbitt producers who take
their history and politics from a press which,
with some notable exceptions, is the most
ignorant and inaccurate in the world. Con-
sider this burst from the Post Intelli-
gencer of Seattle: —
“There will be men aboard the U.S. ships
who knew and hunted the original Emden,
mother of this training-ship—men who laid
submarines and mines to trap her.
“Eieut-Commander I*. T. Wright of the
U. S. S. West Virginia remembers when the
Emden was an unholy terror. He wasn’t on
the West Virginia then but played with a
spunky flock of submarines off the Irish
coast. He crossed and recrossed the path of
the Emden. sometimes fleeing from her, some-
times chasing her, trying to trap her while
the lanes were being cleared for convoys. Tie
knew the original Emden by sight as well
as reputation, and now he wants to know her
offspring, the naval training-ship of 1927.”
That little touch about “the Irish coast”
is a masterpiece. The Emden must have
double-crossed the “spunky flock of sub-
marines” which crossed and recrossed its
tracks in the North Atlantic while it was
doing its dirty work in the Indian Ocean.
And as it was sunk by the Sydney on Nov.
9. 1914, the only American lanes that
needed clearing at the time were alleys that
led anywhere but to France.

£l7OO PRIZE STORY COMPETITION.
“The Bulletin” wants the Australian novel to take the place of
the American and English productions which now flood the bookshops.
A school of short-story writers has been built up in Australia
through “The Bulletin’s” efforts during more than 45 years past.
Now ‘‘The Bulletin” is going to see whether a school of novelists
cannot also be built up.
To this end it offers a minimum of £l7OO in prizes for novels
during the next three years.
The first competition will close on June 30, 1928. For this the
prizes will be: First, £500; 2nd, £125; 3rd, £75.
All persons Australian-born are eligible; also all persons bona fide
resident in Australia.
The stories are to be available for serial publication in “The
Bulletin” and “The Woman’s Mirror.” Otherwise, copyright will
belong wholly to the writer; all picture rights will likewise remain his
property.
POLITICAL
POINTS
The Queensland railways resumed work
after a week’s stoppage because the bulk of
the employees began to have an inkling of
the folly of doing the dumb, driven cow
act at the bidding of A.R.U. president Rymer
and his kind ; because the State was getting
along better than most people had expected
without railways; and because Rymer him-
self urged the men to sign the pledge that
they would obey the rules and regulations
in future. But as the A.R.U. boss also
remarked that they could interpret the
pledge as they pleased it may be inferred
that the effort to foment a new disturbance
will commence before the tail-end of the old
one is out of sight. In Russia Rymer. hav-
ing fallen foul of the Government, might be
retained as a hostage, and might do an unac-
countable disappearance if the trouble
resumed. Only Communists don’t make
strikes there. They are members of a very
select caste, and hang strike-makers on the
very rare occasions when any appear.
When McCormack took up the challenge
thrown at him by the Red leaders of the
Queensland A.R.U., Lang’s paper rose to the
occasion. It described McCormack’s notice
to the railwaymen as “a Plot to Smash
Lang.” And the N.S.W. Premier hadn’t the
decency to repudiate the malignant slander.
Had the trouble occurred in N. S. Wales
there would have been no victory for con-
stitutional government. The faint-hearted
Sydney Premier would have crawled to the
Reds, as he always does.
The other day 300 unemployed wanted to
hold a meeting in Melb. Trades Hall and,
on being refused permission, climbed into the
vast building and started a riot. Terrified
union officials thereupon ’phoned for the
police and several arrived, including no
doubt some of the recruits whom the Trades
Hall declared “black” after the police strike.
To be consistent, that institution should now
declare itself the same color.
There is small doubt that Japan will
shortly increase its grip on the fat Chinese
province of Manchuria. The sudden uncalled-
for announcement by the Mikado’s Foreign
Office that it didn’t intend to do anything of
the sort indicated the way the wind is blow-
ing, and the announcement was followed by
the appointment of high governmental and
military dignitaries to positions on the South
Manchuria railway, the semi-official institu-
tion which runs most of the country. Now
there is talk of measures to put down Bol-
shevism. The loss of his most valuable
colony is the price Ah Bang will probably
have to pay for his recent outbreak of Red
fury.
The N.S.W. railways having made an-
other deficit (£451,618 this time), it is rec-
koned that freight rates, which went up
last November, must sky-rocket again. The
44-hours week, which costs the railways
about £600,000 per annum, was one of the
previous troubles. Among the new ones is
child endowment, which is going to cost
about £700,000 yearly, and a great deal
more if Lang comes back. There is the usual
suggestion that the accounts should be faked
to make them look better. As one paper
put it:—
Developmental lines are not expected to pay their
way, the loss being in the nature of establishment
charges. No business management would, or Should,
be expected to make this loss good out of profits.
One of the most notorious of these money-
losers has been on the sick list for 63 years,
and it is still “developmental.”.
THE BIRD THAT LA US THE SILVER EGG.
“Don’t kill the kid, Lizzie — he’s worth five bob a week now, you know.”
Vic. Governor Somers, while visiting the
Western District, hinted that he had a mind
to settle in the State at the end of his term
and seek election to Parliament. He was
assured that the Western District would be
charmed to have him for a member, and pos-
sibly it would. But at the spot where the
baron spoke Labor seats were all around
him —Slater’s, Bond’s, Bailey’s and Hughes’s.
Higher up in the West the Cockies and
Country Progs, hold possession, and they
would be equally reluctant to quit. His
Ex. would have brighter prospects in one of
the suburban electorates south of the Yarra.
Women are in the majority, and the idea of
being represented by a lord would thrill them.
The Indians in Fiji are to be represented
in the Log. Council by two members elected
by themselves. Introduced from New Cale-
donia in the ’seventies, they now number
well over 60,000 —about 37 p.c. of the popu-
lation- —and are increasing rapidly. Having
secured the franchise, they are already
aggressively asking for more.
A queer situation cropped up at New-
castle when the endorsement of Peter Con-
nolly, secretary of the Ironworkers’ Union,
was withdrawn by the A.L.P. executive at
.Sydney, although he had wxm the selection
ballot hands down. An indignant delegation
from the coal city demanded reasons. The
main reason was that A. 0. Willis, the man
who “cleaned up the movement,” wanted
the seat himself. But the oracle was
worked so clumsily that Connolly had to
be given the nomination, that being the only
alternative to an. almighty row. The sig-
nificance of it all lies in the fact that Willis,
with a fat job as Vice-President of the
Leg. Council, is so certain of the result
of the coming election that he is trying to
find a safe Labor dug-out to crawl into
before the strafe comes down—even if he
has to try to edge a “comrade” of his own
color out into the storm.
The Federal Government has belatedly
decided that the road grants made to the
States must be spent in a passable pretence
at honest road-making, and not in paying
unemployed to camp in Smith’s electorate
and qualify for a A 7 ote. Tenders are to
be called for each work, and if the lowest
tender, say at £20,000, is rejected on the
plea that the State Government can do the
job by day-labor for £lB.OOO, the State
Government is to get £lB,OOO and no more.
Therefore, when the bill runs to £40,000
the State Government will have to find the
other £22,000 itself. It is something, but it
isn’t enough to meet a case like Lang’s.
The N.S.W. Main Roads Board began to
operate in 1925, certain sources of revenue
being specified for its use, and in 1927 nearly
half a million of these funds was seized upon
and put into revenue to eke out an election
surplus. If the State roads fund has spare
half-millions to throw around it shouldn’t
require Federal assistance.
The Turkish “Republic” has had a general
election of the sort that would gladden the
hearts of Jock Garden and his cobber Lang.
Every member allowed to be elected is a sup-
porter of tbe Government, and President
Mustafa Kemal, who is the Government, has
re-elected himself.
Mullock and debris continue to fall on the
heads of N.S.W. Labor politicians, municipal
and otherwise. A bone of violent and lengthy
contention has been the decision to accept
without open competition a tender for 53,000
yards of pavement, the price being allegedly
2s. 9d. per yard more than the Main Roads
Board pays. This was the matter over
which “a bob a ton commission” was rudely
mentioned. The problem was dragged in and
out of the Sydney Town Haul till it be-
came a very dilapidated relic, but an even-
ing came when four Labor aldermen turned
their backs on the cat’s-meaty thing and
strode from the premises, and a fifth, who
is also Minister of Agriculture, stayed away.
So the decision was rescinded,
In recommending his Apprenticeship Bill
to Vic. Assembly, Labor Minister Lemmon
described it as a call to leaders of industry
to assist the State to equip those who would
man the skilled trades in the future. Control
hy a commission of five (two employers, two
Trades Hall Councillors, and a president of
proved administrative ability) is provided
for, the commission is to create trade com-
mittees, and attendance of apprentices at
technical education schools is made compul-
sory. With slight modifications, the bill is
the same as that passed by the Assembly and
laid aside in the Uppah Chambah two years
ago. This time it has a good chance of
going through.
It is gradually emerging from the inter-
minable questionings of the Film Commis-
sion that if the Yankee has a monopoly of
the making of pictures, a few Australian
exhibitors have control of the distribution.
One witness pointed out that a couple of
such firms obtained about 60 p.c. of the
first releases and the smaller man is bound
to accept them. So the only people who can
really produce Australian pictures with a
decent chance of success are these monopo-
lists. It is a fine opportunity for them to
show their patriotism.
The N.S.W. Commission on “good old
Piddo” has only a hazy idea of what it is sup-
posed to inquire into; and apparently there
is nobody that can help it. There has been
some suggestion that the inquiry might be
as to whether Piddington is a dishonest per-
son ; and in that case the Commission will
have difficulty in finding even one man to
suggest that there are any grounds for the
inquiry. Piddington is transparently honest
—the lionestest old lady that ever patted a
little boy’s head and declared that it was a
shame his boots and his clothes weren’t
better and his cheeks twice as rosy. The
real culprit, of course, is Lang and liis Min-
isters, who appointed the dear, vain old
sentimentalist to the job. Which, of course,
is why Lang appointed the Commission.
Arbitration Judge Beeby isn’t having a
good time with the metal-workers. He gave
them an award, and they approved half of
it, while going on strike against the other
half. Instead of standing to his popgun, his
Honor hurriedly altered the bit of award
that was objected to, and spoke severely to
the employers for not doing something that
he never ordered them to do, and also for
bad taste in “flaunting their victory,” if it
was one, which is far from clear. Later
the metals men held a social to flaunt their
victory, a thing the employers never did.
About this time it was alleged that there was
a serious hole in his Honor’s latest decision,
and considering the pace at which awards
are manufactured holes are liable to happen.
Sundry pilgrims have set out from Adel-
aide to resume work on the South-to-North
railway at the sane end —the one which
doesn’t involve humping an immensity of
heavy material half round Australia in ships
only to have delivery held up by revolu-
tionary sympathisers at Darwin. It is still
the same old narrow-gauge or freak under-
taking, so a lot of reconstruction will be
necessary some day. According to calcu-
lations, the rails will reach another dead-
end at Alice Springs about 18 months from
now, and how long the end will stay there
is uncertain.
J. L. Murphy’s Fair Rent Courts Bill was
whisked through Vic. Assembly without
debate. The Opposition (13 of it) contented
itself with voting against the second read-
ing, knowing that the Upper House will
reject or shelve the measure. At any rate.
Murphy won’t be able to complain that
fellow-worker Hogan didn’t give him a show
to stage his pet bill.
N.S.W. Attorney-General Lysaght, who
has been blamed for issuing tin-hare gamb-
ling licenses to Friends of the Movement,
gave a clerical deputation to understand that
Gosling, the Chief Secretary, was really
responsible. The deputation retired marvel-
ling, for Gosling is such a Good Young Man.
Like his fellow-immigrant Willis, he is fond
of descanting on the “religious significance
of the ‘movement.’ ” He is also addicted
to rebuking the capitalist (not the privileged
tin-hare variety) with slabs of Mazzini’s
writings. As a matter of fact, Mazzini was
a lifelong opponent of the materialist social-
ism for which Gosling stands. And rather
than license tin-hare gambling hells to
exploit and degrade the masses, he wouid
have destroyed himself.
The Federal Government has so much
money now, in reality or in theory, that it
has been pressing £20,000,000 on the State
Ministries for road-making, and some of
them find it useful for the purpose of send-
ing city unemployed to dwell in bush camps
till they qualify as voters in the local elect-
orate. But despite this affluence no offensive
speed is displayed over the great transcon-
tinental undertaking. Yet there are abun-
dant reasons for vigor. The trans-Australian
line is a fixed and indubitable obligation,
paid for with a land grant of over half a
million square miles. It will end not at a
dying goldfield, but at a great Federal port.
There are possibilities of making another
Burrinjuck in the central ranges. The Com-
monwealth is the possessor of 334,000,000
acres up that way, which should inspire more
than a languid desire to make them available
for better settlement, and at the same time
avoid some of the remarks that are made
about the incapacity of a nation which
can’t plant quite 4000 settlers on 523,620
square miles.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The old man raised a wrinkled head,
Whence every tooth and hair had fled;
His eye was pink and dim and sad,
But joyfully he said, “Me lad,
Y’re strikin’, are ye? Eh? Well played!
I’m proud to see y’ve learned y’r trade.
But strikes,” he muttered fretfully—
"Ah, strikes ain’t wliat they used to be.
“ ’Twas all of fifty year ago,
In nineteen twenty-nine or so,
When the Great Strike was organised;
And, son, the plans that we devised
To bring the plutycrats dismay
I still recall like yesterday.
Ah, lad, I tell ye strikes was fine
In nineteen liunder’ twenty-nine.
“It started, I remember well,
In Dilly-town, where for a spell
After each beast that weren’t too tame
The Sheep-Dip Union lodged a claim ;
The Court threw out the bill they filed
Since sheep, it said, was never wild:
And then, of course, say what ye like,
The Dilly Dippers had to strike.
“The Shearers thought it only right
To help the Dippers’ Union fight,
And soon the whitest woollies reared
Were one and all black sheep declared;
The Sheepdip Makers’ Union, son,
Soon had that business in the gun ;
And then the Wharfies took a pull
And labelled ‘black’ all sorts of wool.
"The Seamen, lad, was never slack,
And so a lot of ports was ‘black’;
And Firemen, Trimmers, Stewards. Cooks,
All had some ‘black’ lists on their books;
And further lists were daily made
By each affiliated trade,
Until it looked, ye well might say,
That darned few things was even grey.
“At last the long, hard fight was won
And justice ready to be done
Our Dilly brothers in the field ;
The Court agreed at last to yield
Their claim, with right of wages lost,
Employers pledged to meet the cost,
From victimisin’ to refrain
And —then we went on strike again.”
The old man shook his wrinkled head,
As with a fitting pride he said:
“To fight that verdict we was bound—
You see, among the rest ’twas found
Some other union had, out back,
Declared the Dilly Dippers ‘black’!....
Yes, strikes,” he murmured ruefully—
“Ah, strikes ain’t what they used to be.”

“Pourri-Pourri” : The authorities at Bris-
bane’s museum have had an uncommon
experience. A curious medal was left at
the institution with an explanation that it
had been souvenired from a German in
France. The writer went on to say that his
conscience had smitten him, and that he
reckoned it his duty to let the museum have
the article, since he didn’t know the original
owner’s address. Greatly marvelling, the
reader of the note turned the sheet over,
and found the dinkum oil on the back. The
stiffest of stiff luck, it seems, had been the
writer’s portion ever since he took the bauble.
He was satisfied, first, that it was the cause
of all his troubles and, second, that the
museum had a better chance of combating its
malign influence than a mere individual. As
the prize is a curious Maltese cross of
unknown origin, and more than 70 years old,
the institution is willing to take the risk.

“Potts P.”: Usually when a person is
hung up on a live wire or piece of metal (B.
25/8/’27) he is unable to let go, as the
muscles contract involuntarily; but the hands
can nearly always be freed by lifting the
arms with a piece of dry wood or a
dry article of clothing. You may
also catch hold of him with im-
punity if he stands on a piece of
dry wood, thus being insulated from
the earth. A handy and effective
way is to flip a dry garment round
the victim, catching the loose end
as it comes round, and then pull
him away in the loop thus formed.
Care should be exercised in cutting
the current off from a circuit on
which a shocked person is hung
up, as he will often loose his grip
and collapse, possibly falling into
running machinery.

“The Rumpus”: Touching the
wages man and the automatic
small-chang e extractor at home (B.
18/8/’27). Joe, who works on the
next bench to myself, systemati-
cally combs the whole staff on the
fortnightly pay-day, changing his
one fiver and four pound-notes into
ten-shilling notes. One day when
he begged me to surrender my two
ten bobs for his quid, I asked for
his reason. “Seeing you don’t
know my missus,” he replied after
some hesitation, “I’ll let you in the
know. She’s weak on arithmetic,
the wife. Eighteen ten-shilling
notes are too much of a problem
for her, so she doesn’t get ’em all. Even
after I shell out I can dip in her purse with-
out her noticing the difference.” When the
ghost walked again I tried the dodge; but
Joe’s missus must be an exception.
“Caesars Ghost”:
Somebody lias been
marvelling at the
“miracle” of ord-
inarily deaf people
being able to hear
wireless when
using earphones.
There is nothing
miraculous about
it. If you take the
keeper-ring of a
watch between
your teeth, letting
the watch hang on
the chin, and put
your hands tightly
over the ears to
block out sound,
the ticking will be
heard as distinctly
as if you were
holding the time-
piece against the
ear. The same
effect is produced
if the watch is
held against the
neck at the back
of the ear, or
against the fore-
head just over the
nose. The head
cavities act as
drums to repeat
the sounds, and
the auditory nerves,
even if out of gear
through something
being wrong with
the ordinary hear-
ing apparatus, pick
them up. A lack
of scientific know-
ledge about the
functioning of the
senses leads to the
assumption that
because habit has
associated the eye,
nose, ear and
tongue essentially
with particular
senses, their clear
functioning is
essential to the
exercise of that particular sense.

“F.S.H.”: The Chinaman is indifferent to
pain, but electricity will double him into a
knot. On a renovating job in one of the
Sydnev suburbs the electrician’s assistant
connected the wires of a 120-volt current to
a door knob as a practical joke. All the
workmen coming on duty received a mild
shock and showed no ill-effects. Yet an old
Chink hawker, grasping the knob, was
knocked in a heap. It was touch-and-go
with him —and the assistant played no more
such jokes.

“How lovely! And you’ll be the senior partner, too, won’t you, dear?”
on the Birregurra to Forrest line, just after
the train hail left Dean’s Marsh,.that a lady
in our compartment suddenly exhibited symp-
toms of distress. She looked wildly round the
carriage and out through the window, and then
agitatedly yanked the chain. When the
train had been pulled up, and the guard, had
arrived to ascertain what w T as wrong, the
female held out eightpence and remarked,
“I forgot to pay for my bun and cup of tea
at the refreshment-room. Do you mind
taking it back to them, please!”

“Hobson’s Choice” : Auckland’s new aero-
drome site occupies one of the few pieces of
flat land of any extent on the Waitemata.
The neighboring hamlet of Ilobsonville, an
hour’s run from the city by launch or car,
supports a few cow-cockies, a post-office-cwm-
store, a bakery and an earthenware-pipe
works, “the largest south of the Dine.” Since
the Government bought the aerodrome site
another tiny store has opened, but a pre-
dicted boom in building allotments has not
come off. So the pretentious, if honorable,
name of Hobsonville still excites the derision
of our French piano-tuner, who remarked on
his first visit: “You call dis place Hobson-
ville. I haf valk miles, but vere is da

“Tassie”: Mention of the hermit of

For 25 years or more he has been Govern-

ferry and a few tumbledown buildings are
all that is left of a once-prosperous town-
ship, Corinna. Here, many miles from
human habitation, the old man lives, alone
except for a few pets.

“R.L.J.”: Quaint occupations? A man
at Waterloo, Sydney, has the job of looking
after a big area of low-lying land which is
being filled in with a view to selling it as a
factory-site. He draws 2s. for every load
tipped there, and adds to that by selling use-
ful articles found now and then in the
stuff tossed from the carts. Another Sydney
man is a professional finder of lost property.
I made his acquaintance when he brought
along the wife’s missing brooch and collected
the advertised reward. He has regular beats
and earns enough to satisfy his simple wants,
although lean periods are not few nor far
between. , .

“Chevroford”: Motorists often experience
a slight shock when touching the metal of
a car and suppose that the battery is leaking.
Actually, as often as not, what they own is a
huge electrical condenser insulated from the
earth by its tyres. The charge probably
comes from two sources —the air and the
friction of the brakes. In dry parts of
inland Australia the static electricity in the
atmosphere is so great that a comb passed
through the hair wall cause a fireworks
display in a darkened room, and here you
have both ways of creating the juice.'
An owner who recently lost his car by fire
reports that a small spark jumped from the
tank orifice to the pouring funnel at the
moment of tlie explosion. There have been
other eases of the kind.

“Basra”: Touching the question of rela-
tions serving under one another in the A.I.F.
My uncle was a sergeant-major in the Camel
Corps and his son was a private in the same
unit. Uncle was 55, but had convinced the
enlistment-officer that he was 40; he was
on active service from January, 1915, until
after the Armistice. They do not approve
of this sort of thing in the. Navy. There
was a petty-officer who sent his son to Jervis
Bay. On graduation the lad was posted to
the same ship as his father, but as soon as
the skipper heard of it he had the p.o. trans-
ferred to another vessel.
* * * *
“Coot”: Melbourne’s coat-of-arms (B.
l/9/’27) was designed in 1843 by a com-
mittee of three appointed at the first meet-
ing of its pioneer Bumbles : Mayor Condell,
Alderman Kerr (then of the Port Phillip
Herald and, later, first editor of the
Argus) and Alderman Russell. The golden
fleece, whale, bull and ship, which occupy
the respective quarters, represented wool,
oil and tallow, at that time the principal
exports, and their means of transport from
the colony. The motto, “Vires acquvnt
eundo,” was the suggestion of Judge Willis,
Victoria’s first Judge. The original seal was
engraved by Thomas Ham, a brother of
C. jVtTam, who became mayor in 1881.

“Mars”: Is it possible to split hairs finer
than this? Two “musicians” were charged
at Adelaide with having stood in a public
street and refused to move on when re-
quested by the police. One, a fiddler,
pleaded guilty, but the other, an organ-
player of sorts, contended that, .as he had
sat at his instrument, he was innocent of
having stood in a public street. Plea uphold
and case dismissed. Some time ago,. in the
same court, a man was charged with having
used bad language in a public highway. The
evidence disclosed that he had been stand-
ing in a street with his head through the
fence of a public square. The Bench let
him off on the ground that the language had
been used in the square and not in the
street.

“Caveman” : The dominant color used in
almost all national flags is red (B. 18/8/’27).
There are a few exceptions, however. Greece
favors blue and white only, and Brazil has a
green field with a blue globe on a yellow
diamond. The most decorative flags, like
the most artistic postage stamps, are to be
found in the West Indies and South America.
MELISSA WHISTLES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I heard Melissa whistle like a bird!
The leaden sky was still, no blossom stirred ;
Unwooed by any wind the white broom wept;
Hushed on their pale green stalks the poppies
slept,
And all the world was glum—and yet I
heard
Melissa trill and whistle like a bird!
The very birds themselves had ceased their
song,
Hoarding their music all that dull day long;
The gloomy little creek had checked the note
Of wonted mischief in its babbling throat;
No pump went clacking and no mill-wheel
whirred—
Only Melissa fluted like a bird!
Melissa pouted pretty lips, and blew,
And through the mist the golden magic flew
And beat against that solemn windless sky.
What could I do but ask Melissa why
She only on that muted day had grace
To whistle, whistle, whistle round the place'?
And lo ! unbuttoning rosy, puckered lips,
“Good sir,” quoth she, “there are my silken
slips,
My crepe de Chine, my hose of Milanese,
That they may dry I do but pipe the breeze.
I whistle, an it please you. till there blows
A late-come little wind to dry my clothes.”
And so Melissa pursed her laughing mouth —•
How could the wind resist it? From the
south
Came scudding up a breeze, and now I know
On windless days what makes a zephyr blow
All on a sudden ; ’tis the winds have heard
Melissa, merry, whistle like a bird!

THE PURSUIT.
“Although the Vic. Government has frowned upon betting at the tin-hares, interested parties are busy floating companies to exploit the 'sport.’ ”
“Ester”: Wine-bibbers throughout the
world ure discussing the news that 8000
bottles of Tokay 200 years "old are to be
sold in London, a forgotten hoard having
been discovered in Austria. The stuff is in
ancient, hand-blown glass flagons, and it is
expected that collectors will give at least a
pound apiece for these alone. They pro-
bably will get better value than those who
buy the wine for anything else than its his-
torical interest. Contrary to popular super-
stition, very few wines go on improving with
and even these—-invariably of the heavily-
alcoholised sweet types—are far from im-
mortal. Tokay comes within the ageable
class, for it is a heavy, sweet and aromatic
wine, more akin to liqueurs than to any
other product of the grape proper. But two
centuries have probably left even this potent
stuff without a kick worth mentioning. How-
ever, as it will certainly be bought up. by
American millionaires, nobody will be any
the wiser.
* * * *
“Te Anau”: Australians are so used to
“colonial editions” from publishing houses
in London that it may seem captious to jib
at the patronising way some oversea scien-
tists mistreat this southern continent. But
the subject has its serious as well as its
sentimental side. The British Astronomical
Association habitually ignores the whole!
Southern Hemisphere by labelling its star
charts “as seen with an inverting telescope,”
when, of course, all observers south of the
equator normally see the whole heavenly
show the opposite way up. The least the
B.A.A. could do, in the interests of accurate
records, is to add to the above label the
qualifying words “in the Northern Hemis-
phere.” Another way in which northern
astronomers confuse the hemispheres is to
chart the sun as always moving in the direc-
tion of the hands of a watch. In Australian
latitudes its motion is in the opposite direc-
tion. Even experienced English instrument-
makers have sent to southern astronomers
equatorial mountings for telescopes with the
right ascension circles reading the wrong way
round. One price-list from an English
engineering firm actually asked intending
Australian purchasers of its turbines to state
in their order whether the turbines were
required to turn the way of the sun or against
the sun. Seeing that a turbine that turns
with the sun in London would turn against
the sun in Sydney such loose or ignorant
wording might easily lead to costly mis-
takes.

"Aitchse.e” : Any day between 1 p.m. and
2 p.m., except Saturday and Sunday, there
may be seen opposite the Melbourne Town
Hall a kerbstone congregation of enthusiasts.
They are buying; selling, swapping and dis-
cussing stamps. I have known £lOO to
change hands in half that number of min-
utes. All classes are represented: doctors,
parsons and solicitors mingle with brickies
and wharflaborers, and there is no entrance
fee or sub. I fancy it is the only club
of its kind in the Commonwealth, although
they have them in Paris.

“Malalo” : Touching the birth-rate in New
Guinea. If figures indicate that it has
gone down in districts where mission influ-
ence prevails, the reason is not the one im-
plied (B. 4/8/’27). More young married
men are taken as recruits from mission areas
than from elsewhere, and the women, having
been taught morality, bear fewer children in
consequence. In any case the comparatively
low birth-rate in New Guinea may be largely
explained by the native custom of suspend-
ing relations between married couples until
the child is able to run about —one that
might be adopted with advantage in civilised
countries. One may often see children of
four years or more being suckled by their
mothers. There is another custom, too, that
must be taken into account, that of marry-
ing old women to young men and vice versa,
common among most savage races.

“C.W.H.” : Pirongia (formerly Alexandra),
M.L., has streets named after Arctic ex-
plorers—Baffin, Franklin, Hudson, McClin-
tok, McClure, Parry and Ross, for instance.
It was one of the earliest inland settlements
in what is at present the Parliamentary
electorate of Waikato. One-acre sections
were granted free to soldiers who had fought
in the Maori wars. Some warriors never
troubled to lift the titles to their lands;
others sold their allotments for beer. To-day
there are over a hundred sections (locally
known as “absentee acres”) awaiting owners,
and the streets immortalising the Arctic
explorers are a waste of noxious weeds.
* * * *
“Windsor”: Melbourne’s suburban fire-
brigades have queer jobs sprung on them,
too (B. l/9/’27). At Ivew recently a
20-stone householder subject to heart attacks
collapsed on the roof where he was trying
to mend some spouting. Efforts to dislodge
him and carry him down a small ladder failed
miserably, so they rang up the fire-station.
Rope, tackle and the brigade surmounted all
obstacles.
* * * *
“Pfella”: It was in the very early days
of push-bikes, the old “penny-farthing” vari-
ety, and only an odd machine or two had
been sighted at Harrietville (Vic.). Billy
Cooley Avas an old prospector, who fossicked
along the Dargo River, and when his
shammy held sufficient came into the town-
ship for a jag. One day when the world
looked more than usually wobbly to him, a
man and woman—the latter in grey, baggy
bloomers—arrived on their new boneshakers
from St. Bernard’s Hospice, and came at
a fair pace down the hill past the pub.
Cooley got an eyeful of tli e approaching
pair, and with a boisterous yell rushed on
to the road, holding out both arms. The
cyclists wobbled; the man got safely past;
the lady was fortunate to escape with a
not-very-severe fall. Billy was pinched and
charged with drunkenness and disorderly
conduct. His defence, of which there was
no reason to doubt the sincerity, was “1
thought they was emus!”

“Clerk” : The big job of suspending 1650
tons of steel over the Maribyrnong River
(Vic.) will keep an army of workmen busy
until 1929. Electricity and water power,
compressed air. a huge 185 ft. traveller-crane
and stone-crushers and concrete-mixers galore
are being impresssed into the construction of
this viaduct, which will be a quarter of a
mile long and 180 ft. above the river bed.
The new bridge is the most expensive item
on the nine-mile stretch of independent goods-
traek being laid down between Broad-
meadows and Albion at a cost of £452,000.

“J.E.P.”: The first discovery of gold in
Tas. was reported in 1852, the finder being
a shepherd at Tullocligorum near Fingal.
There is reason to believe, however, that the
metal was found on the west coast in very
early days. In 1890 two men, in remov-
ing a tombstone on Sarah Island (part of the
penal establishment in Macquarie Harbor
which was abandoned in 1833), found a little
earthenware jar containing about 10 penny-
weights. This had been hidden in a hole
under the cap of the tombstone. The pre-
sumption is that the prisoners who worked
on the mainland had found this gold and
stowed it away.
* * * *
“Figure Merchant”: Statistical bulletins
contain very interesting information when
properly searched. I learn from the invalu-
able Wickens that the oldest bridegroom in
Australia last year was 87 years of age, and
the youngest bride 12. Among the mothers,
there were six aged 13 years, 34 aged 14
years and 132 aged 15 years. In three
cases parents registered the birth of their
19th baby; in another the infant was the
22nd of the marriage.

“Emel” : No need to go to Papua for in-
stances of abortion induced by violent
methods (B. 11/8/’27). I well remember
hearing a young married friend of mine,
incorrectly credited with being in an inter-
esting condition, being sharply rebuked by
an elderly woman for a sinister design be-
cause she had jumped down from a high
doorstep instead of using the stairs.
* * * *
“Macess” : A Carlton parish paper, quoted
by Melbourne Sun, publishes these among
other excuses received for the falling-off in
juvenile church-attendance : “One lad pointed
out that his father never attended. Another
boy said, ‘What’s the use? Father goes, and
a fat lot of good it does him !’ ” They evi-
dently intend to make father the goat, what-
ever happens.
* * * *
“Chip Carter”: I was trving to ’phone
mv pal at the police-station and my line
must have crossed another; anyway, I over-
heard an excited female appealing to tfte
policeman to come at once. “Me ’usband s
fightin’ drunk again, an’ if he gets in he’ll
murder me,” she yelled. “Have you locked
him out?” the constable asked. “No. re-
plied the lady, “I’ve locked meself in.”
“Blue Duck”: Queer is the craving of
some people for a little notoriety no matter
how brief. An Adelaide daily recently
printed a description of an accident in the
hills: a motor-lorry went over a steep bank
and crashed into a gully 400 feet below, the
driver being killed. Followed details con-
cerning the victim and his family. Next day
the paper discovered that the “victim” had
’phoned the particulars himself and had made
the story so convincing that it was not
questioned.
* * * *
“Mako”: Neatly-phrased telegrams (B.
25/8/’27) ? One Jordan, a well-known Bay
of Plenty (M.L.) parson, had a son who
went to Auckland to sit for an exam. A
few hours after the list came out the clergy-
man received a message reading, “Hymns
Ancient and Modern, 254, verse 5, last two
lines.” The hymn is the well-known “Art
thou weary, Art thou languid,” and anyone
who cares to turn it up may read at the
conclusion of verse 5: “Sorrow vanquished,
labor ended, Jordan passed.”
* * * *
Erua”: Recently a Maoriland banker and
a friend were gazing at the streams of cars
rushing to a popular sports fixture. “I wish
I bad the money paid for all these cars,”
said the friend. The banker looked as if
lie were making a rapid calculation. “I’d
much rather have what’s owed on them,” he
pronounced finally.
* * * *
“Gwy”: The N.S.W. Wildflower Preser-
vation Act doesn't go far enough. It should
protect ferns, which are just as ruthlessly
uprooted as blossoms. While offenders are
prosecuted for selling boronia in the streets,
big emporiums are freely permitted to offer
the public, at bargain prices, staghorns,
elkhorns, bird’s-nest ferns, bush orchids,
“fresh from the bush,” and the like. What
possible reason can be advanced for the dis-
tinction ?
OLD STUFF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘E knows a likely thing, ’e says, that ain’t
been touched since ninety-four;
An ounce or better it should crush, all easy
broke, free-millin’ ore.
•It ain’t too far to cart it in; it’s close an’
’andy to a well.
“I’ll put you on to it,” ’e says, and I says
“Yes, you will, like ’ell.”
I’ve been a fossicker too long to swallow all
the tales I’m told;
There ain’t a bummer knockin’ round who
don’t know where there’s tons of gold.
A man would be a millionaire if he took
note of all they say,
They all know where there’s something good
—that’s why they’re bummin’ beer
to-day.
1 used to fall to talk like that, when I was
innocent and young;
I’ve seen me listen open-mouthed to all the
woolly tales they sprung.
But I ain’t got the patience now—l stop
’em quick when they begin.
A bloke can fool ’imself enough without out-
siders prattin’ in.
“No, Dave, old chap,” I says to ’im, “you
take it on and make your pile ;
I’ve got a notion of me own of where there’s
somethin’ worth me while.
Thanks for the offer all the same, it’s decent
of you, I must say,
But it’s too blanky good a thing for any
man to give away.”
’E knows where there’s a bit of gold, of
course ’e does, and so do I;
We all know where there’s somethin’ good—
until we give the thing a fly.
It’s waste of time for ’im to come to me
and make ’is secret known,
My time is fully occupied in chasin’ rain-
bows of me own.

HONING UP THE HILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Blue were Uie waters,
And bluer was the sky,
Warm was the clover
Where the lambs loved to lie ;
Not a sound I heard
In the morning so still,
But an old woman honing,
Honing up the hill.
“Ochone!” she cried,
“Ochone-a-ree!
Bitter were the years
That got the best of me!
Once I had beauty,
And love that came at will;
Now I’m but an old woman
Honing up the hill.”
“Glory be,” says I
To the old woman there.
“Can’t you see the lark
With his wings on the air?”
Says she to me then :
“You’ve got youth to your fill,
But I’m an old bent woman,
Honing up the hill.
“Honing up the hill,
And my back to the sun;
Honing down the hill
Where the long shadows run ;
Once I had beauty,
And lovers asked my will.
Now I’m but an old grey woman,
Honing up the hill.”

“Sol Malaprop”: I become distinctly
bewildered over these Clark Millions, the
latest development of the Australian custom
of falling heir to vast sums (Page Millions
and Smith Billions and the like) which
blossom for a while and then fade away,
like little Eva. The story, carefully disen-
tangled, is that ex-Senator William Andrews
Clark, copper king, of Nevada and New York
(U.S.A.), was an Irishman and died in
1925, leaving neither widow nor children,
but merely £113,000,000 worth of this world's
goods. “Who’s Who” . for 1927 contains
the name of William Andrews Clark, of
Montana and New York, ex-Senator, ex-
soldier, railroad-owner, and all the rest. The
only discrepancies are that lie was born in
Pennsylvania, that he had two wives, one
being still alive, two sons and three
daughters, and that he was still alive him-
self —at least he was alive till he died, if
he really died. He is the only William
Andrews Clark in 3270 closely-printed pages,
and people worth £113,000,000 are seldom
overlooked The wife and five children are
WE NEVER KNOW HOW WELL OFF WE ARE.
MRS. ENPECK ( severely ): “Did I hear you grumble, John? You ought to he ashamed.

difficult to reconcile with the theory that
the old man was a friendless and perhaps
homeless intestate. One William Anderson
Clark, said to be a poor creature with only
£8,000,000, comes into the tale just to go
out tigain. I understand that after the 113-
million-pounder passed hence in 1925 many
years of litigation ensued, but the details
supplied are sketchy. I have some practical
knowledge of the lost and intestate business,
being a sort. of missing heir myself. I
arrived in this country with Captain Cook,
and the first white man we met on the shore
was William Morris Hughes. He was
waving a red flag with one hand and stick-
ing up an election placard with the other.
That was in 100(1, for next day we received
a cablegram telling about the Norman con-
quest of England. Cook and I received large
grants of land in Sydney from the Hughes
Government, but unfortunately some of my
descendants mislaid the plans and title-deeds,
so the matter is in abeyance. But when I
get it out of abeyance there will be happen-
ings wdiich will make the Clark Millions look
small,

“Ike Hollar”: St. James’s, Sydney, has
always been very High Church; but it is
ages since authority deemed it necessary to
protest, as Bishop D’Arcy-Irvine did the
other day, against practices which “depart
from the usages of the Church of England.”
The last occasion was in the time of the
Rev. Carr-Smith, who carried his doctrinal
belief to the extent of remaining celibate.
There was then a wave of High Churchism,
a reflex of a similar movement in England.
There Ivensit, the bookseller, led a campaign
against “Romish practices” in St. Paul’s
Cathedral. One day lie invaded St. Paul’s
with a party to remove objects they con-
sidered “impious.” There was a scuffle, and
Ivensit fell, crying “1 have been stabbed! I
die that Protestantism may live!” Really,
an angry woman had pinched him in the back.

“.Tesmond”: I can vouch for the efficacy
of salt pork on the end of a string for
seasickness (B. l/9/’27). Many years ago
I had it forcibly applied to me. The over-
large piece of fat and juicy swine nearly
choked me as it was rammed down my throat,
but the going down was nothing compared
with the horrible feeling as it was slowly,
very slowly, hauled up again. I. have never
been seasick since tne bout of vomiting that
immediately followed the operation.

“Night Out" : When the troop-train pulled
up at Snakebite on the way back from
Canbrrr, and the stationmaster opined that
she’d remain there for at least an hour,
Smithers, Bilson and Jackers decided to
make a rapid survey of the surrounding
country and set out in a local Lizzie. They
returned in 59 minutes, but the trooper had
vanished. The s.m. wasn’t hopeful about
the completion of their journey until Smithers
happened to mention that he had some
stamps bearing the Canbrrr impress and the
magic date “May 9, 1927.” So a special
with a cargo of Official Guests paused for a
second on its way through the station, and
the three musketeers hopped merrily aboard.
They were delighted when they found that

“If you must hiccup, George, please have some regard for my feelings and do it in
time to the music.”
sleepers had been allotted them, but grieved
indeed when from the seclusion of their
bunks they heard sounds of woe and lamen-
tation proceeding from three Personages who
had nowhere to lay their heads.
“Runa”: A small girl at
Wanganui (M.L.) had better luck
than the schoolboy somnambu-
list who died at Armidalo
(N.S.W.) as a result of his
sleep-walking (B. l/9/’27).
There was a hall near the
boarding-school she lived at,
and about 11 p.m. a party re-
turning home from a concert
saw a white object moving
along a parapet that ran round
the top storey of the school.
Investigation showed it to be a
child in a white “nightie”—and
the narrow ledge was GOft.
above ground. The first im-
pulse of the onlookers was to
attract her attention, but a man
with a cool head imposed silence
on the horrified group. The girl
■walked to the end of the para-
pet,. turned and walked back
again, and then repeated the
performance, with 50 people
watching her hopelessly. When
she finally clambered to safety
two women among the watchers
fainted, and an agitated section
rushed to the school and awoke
the authorities. Next day the
attic was securely barred
against a repetition of the noc-
turnal excitement.
“Caption”: I know a man with nocturnal
duties similar to those described by
“Uramao” (B. l/9/*27), but when the sun
shines he is several rungs above a milk-ho
on the social ladder. lie is proprietor and
editor of the Blankville Times, and an elder
to boot. Being a philosopher as well as
a pressman, he views with unconcern the
ignoble end reserved for his literary efforts.
* * * *
“Caveman”: I can’t remember “Yardley’s”
prescription of spuds and pepper ever being
offered for sea-sickness (B. l/9/’27). But
I recollect an apprentice, writhing with
stomach upheaval, being persuaded to swal-
low a handful of the rough kitchen fat from
the bos’n’s ‘ locker —a repellent mixture of
grease of dubious age and origin. It didn’t
kill him, but the patient hopefully remarked
that he “felt different.” Our Old Man had
a sound belief in his ability to keep all his
crew on their feet. He owned a medicine-
chest and a doctor’s book, and when you
went to him for treatment he would take
your temperature, consult the book, inspect
the labels on the bottles —never opened—
and decide that a “cooling internal draught"
was required. Then lie would mix a dose of
cascara sag., offering the alternative of castor
oil. I visited him one evening with a
crushed finger. After daubing the injury
with some ointment or other —neither of us
knew what the ointment was—he solemnly
suggested that an “internal dose” might be
beneficial. I declined the offer, and turned
in with an aching flipper but a quiet
stomach.
* * * *
“Fana”: The swill from emptied beer-
barrels has a good deal more kick in it than
might bn thought (B. l/9/’27). In some
country towms it is assiduously sought after
by deadbeats. I have seen a barman empty
the water from a dish, in which hundreds
of glasses had been wmshed, into a cask
containing about a gallon of swill; within
five minutes the lot had been lapped up by
two old ’beats. In fact, the water in which
rum. whisky and gin glasses have been
washed .suffices for some derelicts. At
the end of a busy couple of hours in a bar
the liquid contains enough mixed brands to
give it almost the potency of dynamite; but
down it goes.
“Centurion”: Evidently the English pilot
engaged by Levine, the flying millionaire, is
not a gentleman, in the common or Holly-
wood acceptance of the term. He brutally
refused to allow a beautiful blonde, whom
Levine was anxious to take with him on the
flight from England to New York, to embark
on the ’plane. The lady was all ready for
it, too. A wealthy young person—presuming
her to be under 90, which is the age when
flapperdom ceases nowadays—she had made
her will and put all her jewels in safe keep-
ing, save a few trifles worth £2OOO which
she had donned for the trip. She even
offered the unchivalrous pilot £l5OO to give
it a spin. The reports mention that the
adamant one’s wife was “constantly in
attendance at the aerodrome”—as if that
accounted for his churlish behavior!

“Bumpkin”: A Melbourne storm inter-
rupted a one-man canoe cruise of 2400 miles
to the Gulf of Carpentaria. D. Herbert had
planned to pa'ddle across the continent from
Seymour via the rivers Goulburn, Murray,
Darling, Warrego, Thompson and Flinders.
A drifting launch pulped his tiny craft, but
he intends to start again as soon as he has
a substitute.
THWARTED AMBITIONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I d like to be an ace and span the ocean
through the air
As pilot to a princess or a reckless million-
aire ;
But when I scaled a ladder t’other day to
clear the spout,
My forty summers told on me, and wind and
nerve gave out.
And so I sadly dodder on a serviceable bike,
A brickbat in my pocket for a certain yellow
tyke.
I’d like to be a wrestler at the Stadium, and
vie
In hammerlocks and scissors with a Clapham
or a Thye.
I’d like especially the purse that proves their
savage skill;
But neither thews nor cash are mine, and so
I yammer still:
“Yes, half of bacon, sugar six, a tin of
salmon (small).
Yes; lovely weather, isn’t it? Thank you.
Will this be all?”
I’d like to be a poet, such as Banjo, Den.,
or Quinn.
But when I write a masterpiece and duly
post it in,
The Correspondence Column I read with
tears that scald :
“Such verses knock us bandy—they’ve made
us old and bald.”
And so my pen to baser use is fated : and it
learns
To weave romantic spells about my Income-
tax Returns.

The erratic behavior of the figures over
the past decade reflects the movements in
the rubber market. At the time of the col-
lapse, half a dozen years back, the co. was
caught with heavy stocks and no reserves,
and it took four years to nurse the busi-
ness back to health again. Then the turn-
over began to grow rapidly, and a year ago
the arrears of pref. divs. were wiped out
and the ords. got back into the picture. A
profit was made on the sale of the Mel-
bourne warehouse, and that helped too, so
the 6s. per share lopped off the ords. in 1922
was restored last year, and 125,000 new £1
ords. were offered at par in October to
finance further expansion. That made paid
capital £616,775 in 199,190 prefs. and 420.089
ords.' at June 30, and profitable employ-
ment was very quickly found for the money.
The ratio of net profit to average capital,
including £90,000. from reserves, was 25 p.c.
compared with 26.4, 13.2, a loss and 6.4 p.c.
for the preceding four years. With the
caution born of recent experience only 10
p.c. has been handed out. Of course, it is
a fine thing to put by £78,552 (= 60 p.c. of
the year’s net earnings) ; yet even this lifts
reserves only £63,737 ahead of th e £22,500
of goodwill. Until capital gets a lot more
support, divs. are likely to be sensitive to
the caprices of trade and market.
Recently managing-director Ormiston
looked into mechanical and chemical develop-
ments in tyre manufacture in America. The
result was the addition of two specialists
to the co.’s technical staff and the purchase
of new plant. This, installed at th e Foots-
cray factory, will enable the co. to double
the present output and is expected to be at
work next month. This comparison of bal-
ance-sheet figures shows how the board is
preparing for bigger turnover:—
1921. 1925. 1926. 1927.

Cash, etc. . . 18,932 6,832 16,650 21,862
The liquid surplus (£355,060), including
stocks, was £98,919 stronger. The growth
in the debt is on account of trade creditors ;
the overdraft, mortgage and deposits were
reduced. In addition to the plant and fac-
tory extensions in Victoria, a freehold was
bought in Adelaide and a leasehold in Syd-
ney. With book debts is included £35,935,
the balance owing on the sale of the Mel-
bourne warehouse; other debtors show an
increase of £83,706. Stocks, up £70,595, the
biggest and most important item in the sheet,
are in at replacement cost or less, the chair-
man says. At present the world’s rubber
stocks are large and there has been further
restriction of output in Malaya. The co.
has done splendidly to escape damage from
the falling market. So far the co. has had
no difficulty either in winning sales; but
considering the dulness in the motor trade,
and the recent big move in the Dunlop busi-
ness, and with the Goodyear Co. nearing the
production stage and the Rapson Co. getting
a move on, competition threatens to be
keener. Whether the demand from tyre-
users will increase in th e next few years
largely depends upon the continuance of
good seasons and free spending.
The prefs. follow the ords. to 10 p.c., have
priority as to capital and a net tangible
backing of £3 Bs. 4d. per share: 225. is paid
for them. The net tangible cover for the
ords. is 225. lid. per share, and they are
priced at 28s. 9d., returning the investor a
shade under 7 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis.

The board’s policy is to call in more capital
as the trust business grows, and share-
holders were rejoiced with a request for 3s.
per share on June 1. The response was
prompt; not a penny of the money was out-
standing at the close of the month. The 124
p.c. distribution—24 p.c. the cautious board
labels bonus—supplies the reason. On the
£15,000 that came in 74' p.c. was paid, a
very juicy return considering that the co. had
tlm use of the money for less than a month.
Paid capital is now £175,000 —there is still
£825,000 uncalled—and 124 P-c. for a full
year will require only £750 more than was
handed out in the last term. Only 66 p.c.
of the year’s net earnings were distributed;
the balance piled up the reserves to nearly
306 p.c. of paid capital. That is to say,
shareholders’ funds, 39.2 p.c. of which are
represented by mortgages and 31.6 p.c. by
premises, have only to earn a whisper over
6 p.c. to pay 324 p.c. on capital; so the div.
looks safe enough.
In addition to investment earnings there
are the crumbs picked up from the rich
men’s coffins. And the crumbs are growing ;
during the year the trusts, etc., moved up
nearly £3,000,000, making the total more
than double that of 30 years back. Here
are comparisons showing the progress:—

The co. reserves portion of the corpus com-
mission, taking credit for it as estates are
gradually wound up. Last year’s net addi-
ions to that reserve were £2970, compared
with £4134 in the previous year, and the
figures are treated as stored-up profit in the
introductory table.
Apart from the big block of uncalled capi-
tal clients can see very substantial protection
in the £360,256 of shareholders’ funds, which
are in freehold (£114,000, and worth more) •
mortgages (£141,284, up £38.590) ; cash.
Government securities and book debts
(£36,764, up £12,863). The market heavily
discounts the future and pays £5 3s. for the
£lO shares paid to 355. The immediate re-
turn to the investor is thus only a shade
better than 4 p.c. on a 124 p.c. distribution.
Net tangibles amount to £3 12s. per share

The very satisfactory size of last year’s
profit—ls.B p.c. on average capital com-
pared with 15.8, 14.5, 19.3 and 35.8 p.c. back
to 1923 is due to the increased business won
in N. S. Wales, where the co. was the biggest
seller of a bumper clip. The only records
that eclipse present flock numbers in N. S.
Wales are those of the early ’nineties. These
figures show how the co.’s turnover in stock
and wool has grown :

Cattle values were firmer last year, but prices
for sheep were not strong; the expected
demand from Queensland failed to arrive
owing to the continued drought there.
A pleasant feature of the table is the wide
margin between net earnings and distribu-
tions. In the past five years £94,619 —38.6
p.e. of the net profits—-has remained in the
business after shareholders have had an
average of 9.2 p.c. p.a. But the 10 p.c. div.
will look safer when reserves grow more
substantial. Goodwill, in the books at
£41,983, is offset by a reserve of equal
amount, which is not treated as stored-up
profit in the table. The sheet would lose
nothing worth mentioning if both these items
disappeared.
Here are balance-sheet movements

The £71,878 of new capital helped last year
to reduce the debt. No less than £144,864
was paid off the overdraft, reducing it to
£50,688; but other creditors had to be asked
for a further £48,181 to do it. Nevertheless
the financial position improved. The more
or less liquid surplus (£329,330), including
advances, was £93,754 stronger. At June
30 there was still 16s. 3d. of outside money
at risk in the business for every £1 owned
by shareholders; a year earlier the proportion
was 235. lid. That might be right enough
in good seasons, but wbat may be a perfectly
safe, margin on advances now is liable to
diminish, to dangerously narrow limits in bad
times. Advances (they contracted £5872
during the year) represent 74 p.c. of the
tangible assets; a great deal therefore
depends upon what provision the board has
made for contingencies. The immediate out-
look in the wool market in satisfactory,
but indications are that a lighter clip will
be offered, and rain is badly wanted in many
parts of the Eastern States.
Since the close of accounts nominal
capital has been raised to a round million
by the creation of 600,000 new £1 shares,
but an immediate issue is not contem-
plated. The market values the scrip at
295. 7d., returning the investor 6.7 p.c. p.a.
on alO p.c. div. basis. The pound shares arc
backed by 28s. Id. of tangibles, net. But
the risk of the depreciation of securities
in which borrowed money is invested has to
be taken into account when considering
those figures. In short, £1 of net tangibles is
not always worth the same from tlm
investor’s point of view.

Because exes, took a bigger bite and gross
profit was a little poorer—swine fever made
pigs scarce and dearer towards the close
of the term—the year’s net earnings dropped
£3770._ But the figure still had a lot of
spice in it; it was equal to 21.9 p.c. on
paid capital, ordinary and pref., as it stood
before the 50 p.c. (£30,000) gift issue to the
ordinaries 12 months ago, compared with 22.6
23.2, 16.7 and 24.7 p.c. back to 1923. After
attending to the prefs. (there are 60.000 of
them and they call for 8 p.c. p.a.) the balance
of the year's profit represented 22.9 p.c. on the
inflated ord. capital alone. Although enough
was earned to pay 20 p.c., the reduced rate
represents a very juicy return (27 p.c.) to
old holders. Visible reserves, however, are
slender, and capital will want more support
if the fine results to shareholders are to
continue in less prosperous times. Whether
there is anything much hidden in premises
and plant the “Wild iCat” doesn’t know.
There certainly isn’t as much as there was;
because in 1925 goodwill, which had stood in
the books at £20,000, was written off by
writing up fixed assets.
Here is a view of the business as a
whole, with comparisons :
1922. 1924. 1926. 1927.

Cash, investments,
etc 31,470 9,668 37,717 47,161
The liquids are piling up nicely again. \t
June 30 they were £101,263 in excess of all
debts; the latter were more than covered
by cash alone, and there was £30,000 in
public securities as well. In view of the
high prices ruling for pigs, stocks are a
specially important item; the current term's
profits partly depend upon how they have
been valued. The authorities, by the wav
are making strenuous efforts to wipe out the
swine-fever trouble, which is expected to
be got rid of when the warm weather
arrives.
On the market 255. 3d. or thereabouts is
paid for the well-protected prefs. At that

The old race still continues: coal went up
9d. in December and wages 3s. per week a
few months later. However, keen manage-
ment was able to increase the efficiency of
the plant, bigger returns were won from
coke and after setting aside £170,000 for
special purposes enough of the year’s ‘tak-
ings remained to pay the div. and send
£0157 to reserves. But since these accounts
closed further straws have been laid on the
camel’s back, and the price of gas has gone
up once more to give the poor beast a bit
more strength to bear the extra load. Over
8000 new customers were added to the
books during the year, making the total
310,864; and consumption increased 1.37
p.c. That helped, too; but it also meant
outlay on mains, services and plant, to
finance which 40,000 new £6 A shares were
auctioned in October and averaged £7 Is. Bd.
each. The £240,000 of new capital and
£38,544 of share premiums that came in made
paid capital £3,600,000 and carried the
total premium receipts to £131,422 at June
30. To pay off £450,000 maturing 74 p.c.

Of every £1 of last year’s income manu-
facture and distribution ate up only 13s.
compared with 13s. Gd. in the previous year,
but the proportion for rates and taxes was
10d. compared with Bd. in 1926. Since the
close of accounts another 6d. per ton has
been added to coal, and the management
figures th e direct cost of the Family Endow-
ment Act at £27,000, to meet which the
consumer will pay an extra la. per 1000 c.f.
A disappointing feature of the year was the
shrinkage in returns from bv-products other
than coke. Tar sales (£75,312) dropped
£3458. The use of imported bitumen for
road-making was responsible.
With nearly £5,000,000 in plant the call
for depreciation is heavy. Also the removal
of mains from roadways to footways is eat-
ing up a tidy sum. Last year £92,370 was
spent under those two heads compared witli
£87,414 in the previous year. Under the
co.’s Act revenue can be'charged with 34
P-c. of capital outlay on premises and plant.
This is what has been done in that way

New district gas holders and boosting stations
at Alexandria and Canterbury are expected
to be at work next year. A recent amend-
ment of the co.’s Act opened the way for
extension to the outer suburbs, and pro-
vided the price to the consumer can be
raised the Liverpool gas undertaking will be
bought and, no doubt, extensions in other
directions will follow. However, there are
no benefits for shareholders by way of par
issues; all new shares have to be auctioned.

Broken Hill Prop., with its low-grade rem-
nants. Block 14 will follow suit. The
Pinnacles mine is to close, too, but that is
a matter of water supply: it is eight or ten
miles from the Hill and its service mains.
And it couldn’t come within coo-ee of pay-
ing on present metal prices, anyhow.

In announcing that a trace of real mineral
oil had been found at Bunga, near Lakes
Entrance, Vic. Minister for Mines Jones
warned the public that there was nothing to
justify speculation or excitement. The depth
of the bore from which the oil-bearing
sample was taken is 1229 feet. Laboratory
tests showed that the oil was fairly evenly
distributed throughout the core. Jones said
that it must be remembered that oil of
commercial value had not yet been dis-
covered and that it would be time enough
to whoop when there was a barrelful. Up
to the present even the thimbleful that
Sam Barnes, when Minister for Mines, asked
from any alleged discoverer as minimum
proof has not been supplied. While favor-
ing further exploratory work, the Mines
Department staff endorses the cautious atti-
tude of Jones. Petroleum of the finest
quality has been distilled from Vic. brown
coal, but not at a price that would pay.
❖ ❖ ❖
Liquefaction and hydrogenation processes
for the extraction of oil from coal and shale
having proved successful, company pro-
moters are reaching for their paint-brushes.
The brown coal areas of Vic. have been
stirred into new life. One proposition, still
in the preliminary stages, was given an
airing recently. Government figures were
quoted as to the oil possibilities of the
coal and they certainly made rich reading
—the decimal points had been shifted two
places to the right, wdiich turned a third of a
gallon into 33 gallons per ton ! Practically
every figure was treated the same way. Also
there was talk of mining the coal. Brown
coal cannot be mined commercially except
by open cut. If the overburden is too great
to strip, then the proposition may be let lie.
Between Iledley and Gelliondale, about 120
miles from Melbourne, 5000 acres of brown
coal land has been taken up. Here the
overburden ranges from 20ft. to 100 ft. This
is linked up with a big hydrogenation scheme
which counts the brown coal end a mere
trifle.

Ipswich is rubbing its eyes at seeing thou-
sands sterling being sunk in the old
Bindley seam on a new tunnel and coke
ovens. The Bindley is in the Tivoli district,
in which several other seams have been
worked by the late John Wright and his sons
ever since Ipswich started as a c-oal village.
Bindley was opened 40 years ago and turned
down several times on account of too much
ash. It has been recliristened the Metro-
politan and the cash is coming from Bris-
bane. Andy Wright’s opinion on prospects
should be worth having.

Although Ipswich (Q.) coal trade can be
accounted on the dull side, a scramble is
taking place to secure workable areas on the
Aberdarc seam, which is the mainstay of
the field. Practically all the crop coal has
gone and it means stabbing deep areas.
Blacklieath co. has been doing some boring
without much result so far, and a new r co.,
Aberdare Consolidated, is opening up the
Grange lands from the Coolgardie workings.
The seam touches 1300 or 1400 feet at its
deepest part here, but is intact below 700 or
800 feet. This is an alternative to Harry
Hart’s deep-mining scheme vouched for by
I). McGeachie. The area is proved only by
one deep drill-hole and the worked-out mines
down the slope of the basin. The working
scheme adopted is the safer considering the
limited data available as to whether the
Aberdare is payable over most of the Grange.

Birch Tin, Ltd., has started off with
£5OOO in hand towards cleaning up the
Quartette dredge area on the Severn River,
near Stanthorpe. They are installing a
Hughes concentrator and expect to get a lot
more tin than the 70 tons reckoned safe by
Geologist St. Smith. Lode operations around
Carpenter’s Gully and Red Rock, which pro-
mised results a few months back, have not
succeeded in the hands of another local syn-
dicate. Brilliant specimen stuff, but too
scattered —that’s the tale in a nutshell.
* * * *
The past few mouths have been devoted
in the Great Northern, Herberton (Q.), to
prospecting tin leaders from which small
crushings of 5 or 6 p.c. dirt have come, as
well as running dumps through th e battery.
A few hundred tons of the latter have
averaged 30s. a ton. (This is with tin oxide
at £lB4 on the field.) They earmarked cash
reserves for prospecting to locate a new
shoot. Vanished are the rich returns that
lined pockets in good fashion last year. But
luck may turn any time; two leaders now
being tracked are promising. The occurrence
of shoots in this mine is most erratic. The
merest thread of tin is often the indicator
of a payable shoot, and it never pays to
neglect these leads.

In spite of attempts by outsiders to stave
off the evil day, the liquidators of Mount
Morgan are pushing on with their job,
especially with the smelting clean-up of cop-
per- and gold-bearing matter in hand.
Results as produced are forwarded to Kernbla
for final treatment. The clean-up will not
be completed till the end of this year; mean-
while tenders are to be called for the pur-
chase of everything—buildings, plant and
equipment, and titles, freehold or leasehold,
including coal and limestone areas.

Westralia’s latest gold find near Wiluna
has not come up to expectations. A few
weeks ago it was booming; now, after a brief
silence, the announcement is made that some
options have been abandoned or are about to
be throwm up and that nobody has found any-
thing to hallelujah about. A good gold
discovery would be as welcome in the West
as the death of a rich old bachelor uncle.
In the last eight years the Mines Depart-
ment has spent over £50,000 in assisting
1192 prospecting parties without getting any-
thing except promising reports and a very
occasional dividend from the finders of small,
isolated patches.

Greenbuslies tinfield (W.A.) is again de-
pressed. It livened up recently on the
strength of good reports about the Corn-
wall mine, the starting of several dredges
and prospecting for lost or never-found lodes.
But the Cornwall has since closed down,
returns from dredging proved very small and
prospecting has met with little success. As
previously mentioned on this page, over a
million pounds’ worth of tin has been won
from this field, and local optimists vehemently
declare there is a lot more left. There
often is on a tinfield. The trouble is to get
enough of it in one place to make the
winning worth while.

Despite a sick metal market, the Perth
crowd which is developing the Braeside silver-
lead show in Nor'-Westralia is still hope-
ful of inducing London speculators to buy in.
Recently Corbould and others got Gerald
Lovell, formerly head of the Burma Mines,
to inspect and report, and the London people
were offered Government assistance on a
£-for-£ basis up to £5OOO as an encourage-
ment to come in. So far. however, nothing
of much account has been done.

Boulder Prop, made a loss —the first in its
history—last year; but chairman Wadding-
ton prophesied at the recent annual meeting
that the co. would do better this term. Dick
Hamilton, the local director and ex-manager,
supported Waddington. He said there was
more ore showing in the mine now than at
the close of last year. He did not like to
guess, he said, how long the Boulder would
last, but, judging by present appearances,
it should keep going for at least two or three
years.

Freney Oil Co. potters along, backed by
Commonwealth subsidy, and is spending the
little money it has left in putting down a
new and probably last bore. So far none of
the “traces and globules of oil’’ found in pre-
vious bores have been met with in the present
one, but the co.’s experts are still confident
that something will be struck before long.
It is lucky for the rest of us that there are
optimists in this world.

Phillips River is trying hard to live.
Years ago several mines there produced
copper at a pi’ofit, and later some small gold
deposits were worked with success. Later
still, in wartime, the high price of copper
induced claim-holders to mine for that metal
in preference to gold, and now that copper
has slumped they are again looking for gold.

Radio South is endeavoring to resuscitate
with the aid of an option in Central Aus-

whether it will have to be listed as another
blasted hope.

The latest addition to the cos. that want
to pull gold out of the New Guinea clouds
is a Sydney flotation, Watut-Bulolo Allu-
vials. Nominal capital, £IO,(XX) in 400
shares of £25 each ; 60 of them to be issued
to the vendor, who will also pouch £3500
in cash. The co. aims at acquiring four
240-acre leases “about five miles below the
junction of the Bulolo River and Watut
Creek.” These have been found gold-bearing
by R. M. Glasson, on e of the original Edie
Creek prospectors. The new show proposes
to bore the properties, and if the prospects
are good enough, to float cos. to take out
the wealth. The prospectus has the airy
vagueness of nearly all these New Guinea
propositions, but, anyhow, it doesn’t pro-
fess to be more than a good gamble. The
first directors are T. Sampson, R. M. Glas-
son, J. H. Sloan and T. Mateer. The Bul-
letin knows Sloan as one of the most
esteemed of the early Papuan prospectors
who opened up the goldfields of the North-
ern Division over a generation ago.

There was an air of relief in the Aus-
tralian tin-share market when news came
through last week that Selayang’s dredge,
which only set in on August 21, had cleaned
up 8 tons from 25,000 cubic yards, averag-
ing about .731 b. to the yard, by August 31.
The area, near Kuala Lumpur (F.M.S.),
was originally acquired from F. G. Pratten
and Malcolm Newman, of Alluvial Tin, for
40,000 fully-paid shares in the co. to be
floated. British Malayan, the purchasers,
turned it over to Salayang for £65,000, of
which £5OOO was in cash and the balance
in fully-paid shares. Selayang’s capital was
£140,000 in £1 fully-paid shares. Selayang
w r as floated in London in December, 1924.
Boring estimates were conflicting. F. W.
Payne and Son, of London, estimated a
general average of .601 b. to the yard. Mal-
colm Newman, in a special report, estimated
the total dredging area, about 24,000,000
c. yd., as going .80 to .90 lb. Few Malayan
properties have been more discussed in Aus-
tralia, where the first dredging returns have
been eagerly awaited. The bottom was
known to be limestone, and it was asserted
that limestone “pinnacles,” which make
bucket dredging impossible, adorned it in
abundance. It is too early yet to judge if
this theory is correct, but as far as the small
preliminary return goes shareholders have
every reason to be satisfied. The dredge is
a first-class modern plant, with an estimated
capacity of 150,000 c. yd. per month, and
has done well, in its preliminary canter of
10 days, to get out the yardage quoted,
while averages are more than reassuring.
If there is a catch, it lies in the fact that
the average depth of the yardage is 50 feet,
to which the dredge is designed to dig, and
that to find those alleged limestone “spikes”
it will have to get well down to that depth.
Whether the plant has done so in its prelim,
is not stated, but the mid-September returns
should clarify the position.

Bux Syndicate has a passion for mining
risks in far-away lands. Not content with
its ancient setback through Badak, it has
sent G. H. Bryant to Portuguese Timor to
take up oil concessions. When he got to
Dilly he found that the Government had
issued an ordinance inviting applications for
an oil-prospecting monopoly over the Portu-
guese half of the island of Timor. This is
what gave rise to the rumor in Melbourne
that the Timor Petroleum Co. had lost the
lease on which it is drilling. Now Bryant
reports that to date there had been no appli-
cants for the monopoly, and he had applied
for leases for oil, rubber, cotton and kapok.
But unless the system has been changed the
leases will have to go to Lisbon for appro-
val; and neither Portugal nor Holland likes
granting leases to aliens.

Ratrut Basin shareholders were asked to
sanction the increase of capital from £250,000
to £280,000 by the issue of 30,000 new £1
shares, at a premium of 55., to pay for unex-
pected costs of shifting over to Sichon. The
whole of the new issue has been taken up by
shareholders, to whom the premium is to be
returned in dividends.

Takuapa’s return for August, shows a sad
falling-off from July, though the number
of hours worked is about the same. This
nionth's gathering is 37 tons only, as against
57_ the previous month, the turnover being
135.000 and 120,000c.y. respectively. Evid-
ently another period, of “dead” digging has
had to be tackled, a task Takuapa has had
to face several times since the first dredge
set in in May, 1925.
* * * *
Ivundang, with 30 tons from 88,000 yards,
did a little better in August than it did in
July, when it had to turn over more ground
to get the same return. The new dredge,
which began working in January, is still
short of its 120,000 yards estimated cap-
acity. However, the original estimates asked
for only 30 tons per month to show a
good profit, and it has managed at last to
reach that output two months in succession.
* * * *
Malim Nawar got a better return, with 26
tons, and a slightly better yardage average,
but _it isn t yet up to its boring values.
Malim Nawar South has proved a more satis-
factory proposition, but though in two
months it has given 40 and 36 tons, the
estimate of lib. per yard hasn’t yet been
reached here either.
$
Rawang took 32 tons from 109.000 yards
treated by its bucket dredge, and 30 * tons
from 70,000 yards handled by the sluicing
plant. The previous month’s figures were
25 tons and 50 respectively. But during
the past month the sluicing plant has been
undergoing one of its periodical shifts.
Figures also indicate that the dredge has
been searching for the good places; Rawang
is inclined to be patchy.

Sydney Siam is another N.S.W. holding and
prospecting co. which has had to ask share-
holders for more. The original authorised
capital was £30,000 in £1 shares, 15,000
of them issued to the promoters. The co.
has been dabbling in Siamese options and has
found the business more expensive than it
had figured on. Authority has now been
given to create 20,000 new shares at £1
each. Only 10,000 will be issued at present;
they will be offered to shareholders.

Pattani Consolidated is an English eo.
which has Australian-born Alluvial Tin for
its consulting engineers; and a few shares
are drifting this w T ay. The co. was registered
in London in December, 1926, to work a
property at Lampaya, Siam, purchased from
Pattani Tin. the price being £60,000, pay-
able in shares. The dredgable area is esti-
mated to contain 9,000,000 cubic yards,
which boring has proved to contain 0.901 b.
tin oxide to the c.y., while there are also
4.000,000 yards which will be treated by
hydraulic sluicing, and an additional 800
acres to be worked that way when the first
section is exhausted. The co. has ordered
a bucket dredge of 200,000 yards per month
capacity, shipment to begin in October next.
An option on adjoining land has also been
acquired. Authorised capital is £160.000 in
ss. shares. Issued capital is in 300,000
shares f.p. to 55., and 340,000 paid to
2s. 6d.

Old Unionist”: Afternoon tea is always
associated in my mind with Joe Cook and
George Reid. George was doubtful of his
East Sydney seat, and because I was leading
a fight for the clerks, who were numerous
there, he made overtures, thinking that a
sympathetic gesture might stave off defeat.
He took me to an exclusive club, and rang
up Cook. “Come down, Joseph, and have
a cup of tea with me and a friend,” he
said. Smiling at his whimsical description of
whisky, I remained, and Cook arrived. It
was tea.
“Oxmead”: Read somewhere that Smiler
Hales had dedicated his latest novel to Ned
Harney, K.C., sometime a Federal Senator
and now a British Liberal M.P. Thirty
years ago, when Bigjolm Forrest decided it
was time for the Old Camp to have a mem-
ber of its own, Smiler and Ned promptly
lodged their entries. Smiler in a special
article contrasted his own record as a rugged
democrat—there was no Labor party in
W.A. then —with that of the barrister
“nursed in the broad lap of luxury,” etc.
But at the last moment Harney puiled out
and contested Esperance, and Smiler was left
to be walloped by A. E. Morgans, capitalist
and mine-owner.
According to legend, Queen Bess presented
a ring to her favorite Essex when he de-
parted on the expedition to Cadiz in 1596,
with the injunction that if- he got into hot
water he should send around the ring and
she would grant him absolution. He got
into the boiling liquid, and when he was
about to be beheaded duly forwarded the
bauble, but it got into the hands of the
Admiralty instead of reaching his royal mis-
tress. Flinders-lane and the Melbourne firm
of Makower, Mcßeath and Co. now come
into the story. E. Makower bought the
ring at Christie’s and presented it to the
nation. It was laid with ceremony on Eliza-
beth’s tomb in Westminster. So the stormy
lady gets back her present by a means that
eten the Court prophet could not have fore-
told.
“Ah Ivee” : I arrived at Auckland in the
Maheno from Sydney the morning King
Edward died (B. 18/8/’27). Flags were
everywhere half-mast, and bells tolling. We
anchored in the stream, and news of
Edward’s death was brought aboard by the
health officer. Thinking to take a rise out of
one of the boatmen, a passenger called out
to him: “Who’s dead?” lake a flash came
the answer, “Soult!” Maoriland’s champion
sire had died the same day.
Retiring after 25 years’ service is Cyrus
J. Williams, engineer of the Lyttelton
(M.L.) Board. He was born
in Sydney _ and got all liis practical
experience in Banan aland. As engineer
to a dying port all the ports in Fern-
land’s southern half have been staving
off extinction for years—he hasn’t had a
stimulating time, but he has the satisfaction
of knowing the trade of Port Cooper is still
fairly healthy because he has insisted on
equipping it with every modern gadget. His
most notable achievement as an engineer hap-
pened when an imaginative member of his
board suggested that the mile and a half
tunnel that joins Christchurch to its port
should be turned into a cutting. Williams
had never till that moment heard of the
notion, but. before the visionary had finished
depicting liis dream the engineer was ready
with an estimate of cost.
A Labor advocate complained of being
made a fool of before Judge Lukin in the
Arbitration Court. Whereat the Judge looked
reminiscent and related how he had appeared
for a prisoner before the Full Court and was
rapped on the knuckles for not having
properly prepared his brief. Undaunted, he
continued to argue until he had talked him-
self into some knowledge of the case. It
was then discovered that lie had been wast-
ing his breath, the prisoner having escaped
from custody several days before.
Jim Lawson, son of Henry, broke through
into print last year with some kiddie verses
in a short-lived weekly. His first long prose
effort, “The Unlucky King,” is a fourteenth-
century story of the peasants’ revolt under
Wat Tyler, and the N.S.W. Education
Department lias it under consideration as a
school text-book.
Jackson, Labor member for P’ran, has a
big following in his fight in Vic. Assembly
to have cash orders abolished. A mixed
crowd inside and outside the House is cheer-
ing him on. He has aroused the jealousy of
a couple of fellow Labor members, and at a
caucus meeting one comrade defended the sys-
tem, but the atmosphere froze him into
silence. Jackson’s bill has had an airing, and
Hogan is to see if he can either take up the
subject or give the sponsor time to push it
through.
Bob Elliott is a young Melbourne engineer
who makes time for many things outside his
profession. A trustee of the National Gal-
lery and Museum he is known as “the man
with the Orpens”; these paintings, together
with his Hilders and other pictures, are on
loan to the Adelaide Gallery. Since acquiring,
R. D. ELLIOTT.
with Earle Page, the Mildura paper, Elliott
has become a champion of country interests.
He took a leading part in the recently-con-
summated scheme whereby 160 country
papers have combined in a common policy
to see that the country keeps its end up.
Another link with the Kelly Gang snapped
when Tom Eloyd passed out at Wangaratta
(Vic.). Lloyd was a cousin of Ned and
Dan Kelly. When Sergt. Kennedy and
Constables Scanlan and Lonergan were shot
by the gang, Lloyd brought the news to
Greta 10 hours before Mclntyre, the sole
survivor, reached the police-station at
Mansfield. On New Year’s Day, 1879, Lloyd
was arrested as a sympathiser. While in
gaol he showed that initiative which served
the Kellys so well. Protesting against the
loss of stock which would result from his
absence he was permitted to send instruc-
tions. Some hours after the wire “Turn out
the bullocks from the near paddock into the
far one” had been despatched, officialdom
awakened. A party of police went hot-foot
and discovered that the four bullocks had
departed, leaving much of their parapher-
nalia behind—a billy of tea was still hot.
In later years Lloyd won the respect of all
who knew him, and by hard work piled up a
little fortune.
Assistant-Magistrate Ivarius, leader of the
Papuan patrol which recently failed to cross
the Victoria Emanuel Range from the head-
waters of the Ply River, is preparing for
another attempt. The primary cause of his
failure was the unsuitability of the swamp-
bred Western natives as carriers. Now he
is seeking boys from the mountainous
D’Entrecasteaux islands, and, failing these,
from the Orokaivas of the Northern main-
land. Aided by his recent experience and
backed by sturdy carriers success should
come his way next attempt.
The Ma State’s electors seem to have a
partiality for one-legged men. Roland Green
represents Richmond in the Reps. Sandy
Jacques has held down a cushion in the
State House since 1920, and if he defeats
Preston Stanley in the argument for Waver-
ley will have another term; and W. E.
O’Hearn, who is also minus an arm, has
served Maitland for a similar period. After
the State elections still another may be
added to the group ; Dick Wilkins, the one-
legged Wellington stock and station agent,
possesses a good chance of unseating W. F.
Dunn at Mudgee. O’Hearn is the only
Laborite.
“0.P.H.”: Listening the other night to
the present-day Murphy (J. L., of Port
Melb.) in Vic. Assembly, I recalled an inci-
dent in which his namesake, the genial Ned,
from Warrenheip, figured prominently. It
was an all-night sitting, 29 years ago, and
George Turner, then Premier, had the floor.
The House was boisterous but good-tem-
pered. Murphy, who was an Oppositionist,
moved unobserved into the Premier’s seat!
The Opposition hailed the “new Premier,”
and Murphy rose and bowed. Turner glanced
around, and, seeing that it was merely
Murphy, went on with his speech. Ned
went to sleep, but the hilarity of the
Opposition wakened him. “Don’t mind thim
blatlierskiting fellers over there,” he said to
Turner, “you’re doin’ very well.” The
House roared its appreciation. J.L. is not
likely to equal that. Poor Ned is under the
sod, and Hogan is his second successor for
Warrenheip.
A. P. Elkin, a Sydney University gradu-
ate who tacks “Rev.” to his name, special-
ises in the study of the Australian abo. He
was offsider to Elliot Smith when the well-
known anthropologist led his expedition
through the N.T. and Centralia. Elkin re-
turned from Britain recently, and the
National Council of Research promptly
nailed him for investigation work among the
natives of Norwestralia. He will spend a
year in the Kimberley district examining
social laws and customs of the resident
Binghi.
Jim Curnow, who has become Mayor of
Bendigo (Vic.), is no stranger to the rabbit-
trimmed gown and slave necklace; he wore
them more than 20 years ago. He was sec.
of the Bendigo branch of the A.N.A. in the
old days when it had a big membership
and tried to dominate the association. Cur-
now made a bid for an Assembly seat but
failed to command the requisite majority.
He is acting head of the Vic. Health Com-
mission, a body which is due for abolition.
An Australian who has stayed at home
and yet won a reputation in Yankeeland
is F. W. Boreham, a Baptist parson of
Armadale (Vic.). He is known in the
States as the Australian Charles Lamb, and
his volumes have a flattering circulation in
that country. Boreham has published a
score of volumes of essays or sermonettes,
and is resigning liis pastorate at the end of
the year to undertake a 12-months’ lectur-
ing tour in the Bible belt and other parts of
America.
Ex-Supreme Court Justice Hartley Wil-
liams isn’t a record pensioner, but he is
in the race. He served on the Vic. Bench
for 12 years and got a pension of £l5OO.
He has drawn it for 24 years. As he has
lived since his retirement in the Cold Land,
about £36,000 has followed him out of the
country. And all because he was piqued at
being passed over for the Chief Justice’s
chair when John Madden was chosen. In
those days it wasn’t thought the thing to
“promote” a puisne Judge.
“H.K.”: At least one eminent cleric in
Australia has suffered the sting of the tat-
tooist’s needle. One of Monsignor O’Haran's
schoolfellows was Frank Power, the war cor-
respondent, who was killed with Gordon at
Khartoum. Power had a fancy for predict-
ing the careers of his mates, and, when they

Court. He may lack a little in dignity ,
but he makes up for it by remaining
quite human.
were willing, lie recorded his predictions
with a tattooing needle. On the arm of a
future architect he would engrave a build-
ing, on that of a sailor an anchor, and so
on. For young O’Haran he foretold the
Church.
THE CLIMBERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We have climbed a long hill, a high hill, a
rough hill,
And we were spent and weary long ere
We reached the crown;
Before us now a deep grade, a steep grade,
a last grade—
There’s darkness in the distance and we
are hasting down!
W e started with the morning, fair morning,
bright morning;
Blue was the sky above us, with ne’er a
speck of grey;
Full brimming was our measure of pleasure
and leisure,
Sweet-scented were the gardens that blos-
somed by the way.
And then we found a new road, a hard road,
a quick road
That twisted round a hillside where mile 3
were long and lean ;
It led us through the liigh-ways, the dry-
ways, the by-ways,
But we looked never backward, for we
were young and keen,
When shadows slowly shortened and broad-
ened and deepened
We found a sheltered haven, and halted
there a while;
But restlessness was on us, and worry and
flurry,
And ere our shadows lengthened we trudged
another mile.
Soon sullen clouds came creeping, and sweep-
ing and weeping;
Bitter sleet was beating and gloomy was
the day.
Our heavy feet were sagging, and dragging
and lagging,
And we were near despairing, for We had
lost our way.
Though in Opposition, ALEC PEACOCK
(Vic.) can still smile.
But as the cloud was broken and scattered
and tattered,
And when the sun came peeping, once
more we w r ere elate;
We saw a silver lining, a-shining, clear
shining—
Like some great hope before us; and then
we found a mate.
There for an hour we rested, and lingered
and loitered ;
The time went by unheeded, the sun was
on the wane.
And we were building castles, fair castles,
air castles;
Our mate’s soft hand was in ours as we
moved on again.
She helped us on our journey, hard journey,
long journey;
Her arm was ever ready, lest we should
trip or fall;
She cheered us in our troubles, big troubles,
small troubles,
And carried half the burden— sometimes
she bore it all.
There’s darkness in the distance, clear dis-
tance, near distance;
The west is splashed with crimson, the
sun is out of sight;
Across the road are stretching and reaching
and spreading
The silent, ghostly shadows that mark
the fall of night.
N.S.W.
JIM GRAIIAME.

“Wang” : “The cheek o’ some fellers,” said
Old Dan from a corner of the bar, after
Ryan had dealt with a derelict who had
tried to cadge a billycan of beer. “The
cheekiest bloke I ever knoo was a bluey-
’umper as come t ! tli’ station I was graftin’
on down tli’ Darlin’. ’E blew along t’ tli’
’omestead an’ pitched sich a tale to tli’
STERN NECESSITY.
SCANDALISED MAN: “I don’t think you ought to wear that short rami in Port Moresby,
my dear.”
HIS WIFE : “But I’ve got to wear something, honey. You’ve no idea how fussy these
white people are.”
missus—she was on’y a bit of a girl fresh
from Sydney—that she gave ’im a soot of
’er ’usband’s—reel good soot it was, too.
W’en th’ boss come ’ome that night she tol’
’im all about it. O’ course, ’e went crook,
an ’she starts t’ cry. Nex’ mornin’ th’
boss is np at th’ stable talkin’ to me w’en
’oo should drift up but fill’ swaggie she’d
given th’ soot to! ’E’s got it on, an’ ’e
walks up t’ th’ boss an’ says, ‘I come t’ see
if y’d put it right?’ ‘Put w’at right?’ says
the boss, glarin’. Th’ bloke fumbles in a
pocket an’ pulls out a piece o’ paper. ‘This,’
he says—‘the cheque w’at was in tli’ coat
yer missus gives me. Y’ve crossed it, an’
they won’t cash it at th’ bank.’ Th’ boss
let out a roar; an’ if I ’adn’t got between
’em that swaggie would ’a’ been in frag-
ments in a few minutes. An’ tli’ best of it
was th’ cheque was fur me fur me last
month's wages.”

“Veega”: I can settle “Aquila’s” doubts
(B. 18/8/’27) as to whether eagles kill lambs.
Recently, on a run in the Wyalong (N.S.W.)
district, I came across 10eagles in one paddock,
together with three lambs they had patently
killed and partly devoured, aud another
with life still in it. In another paddock,
next day, I found a two-tooth wether killed
by eagles. The bird leaves his trade-mark
in a characteristic wound inflicted on the
head by means of the beak. On the other
hand, I question whether the fox is a lamb-
killer, though he gets plenty of blame. On
To lam o and Kincliega stations in the Darling
River country there are a great many foxes,
yet last year, on the authority of the manager
of Tolarno, they marked averages of 102
and 105 per cent, respectively.
‘‘Cosmo”: I can give “Aquila” one good
reason why eagles should be shot. J. F.
Byrne, of Walga station, Nerriga (N.S.W.).
recently saw three eagles attacking one of
his yearling heifers. The youngster was
nearly down and out when one of the younger
Byrnes came on the scene and settled the
birds.
“Malo" : “Aquila” is not a sheepman, or
he would not defend the “noble” wedge-tailed
eagle-—the only noble thing about him is
his appearance. These birds move about
from one place to another as lambing occurs.
They can carry, comfortably, a lamb a week
old, but often attack larger ones; two or
three will sometimes combine and beat back
the mother to secure her lamb. I have known
them attack kangaroos, and a couple of them
can give even an “old man” a rough spin.
As to their eating carrion, I don’t believe
the birds will eat anything unsavory while
live stuff is to be caught.
“Dinkum”: In Queensland I once saw
a wedge-tailed eagle swoop down on a lamb
20 or 30 yards from its mother. He
struck the little woolly across the loins, and,
although I was only 150 or 200 yards away
and galloped up making as much noise as
possible, I was too late to save the lamb,
though the bird didn’t get his dinner.
:!• :!: *
“Mulgo”: Is “Never Never” a corrup-
tion of the abo. “neber neber,” or is the
latter a blackfellow’s version of the former?
The term seems to have been first used
at the beginning of the pastoral settlement
of the Eachlan and Murrumbidgee rivers.
To those pastoralists the country beyond
their western horizon was the “Never
Never.” I have seen no explanation of the
term as it was used then, except that it
expressed “the limitless unknown.” That
hardly answers the question that is prompted
by the term —never never what? A big
central and north-western tract is the present
“Never Never,” and to a good many who go
there it means “never, never come back,”
but to the public generally it signifies the
uninhabited and unknown, or the wild and
inhospitable. But that doesn’t get to the
root of the matter. If it doesn’t come from
the abos., what exactly did the first man
mean who set it going?
SURE SIGN.
“Jimmy, come on in and be washed."
“Who’s cornin’, mum?”
“Eureka”: If a mill can be called a house
I can answer “J. McG.” (B. 4/8/’27) in
the affirmative. In the early days of
N.S.W. a mill was erected at Nimmitabel,
and for many years it did good service. The
stone tower is all that remains since a
meteorite fell on the building and burnt the
combustible material to the ground; it fell
during the progress of a severe dry storm.
Many old residents remember the occasion
and say that they thought this ball of fire
falling from the heavens heralded the end
of the world. Should another meteorite
fall on the remains of the mill it will
occasion a fine spectacle, as the tower is now
used as a store-room for benzine.
* * * *
_ “Gouger” : The reef octopus is a favorite
dish with Binghi and his island cousin. In
the nor’-west season the squirmer is plenti-
ful on the reefs. He is of small size and
possesses the power of changing his coat to
the colors of the corals and sea plants. This
gift is an offensive and defensive weapon.
I have seen fish come up and nose him as if
he were an edible seaweed; on the other
hand, fish that prey on him frequently
pass him by unrecognised. Bike the squid
he ejects a cloud of inky fluid when annoyed.
Binghi spears him. When boiled the skin
of the suckers peels off easily, exposing a
milk-white flesh; fried in cocoanut-milk or
curried, it is very appetising. Some reefs
in early morning are alive with the things,
but during the sou'-east season they are diffi-
cult to get.
* * * *
“The Jumper”: Shortening an axe-handle
does not increase the power of the blow,
as “F.S.H.” (B. 11/8/'27) appears to think.
The shortened haft makes possible a much
speedier stroke, and that is what counts
when expert axemen are doing a lightning
chop. Some chip-scatterers, to gain power,
grip the end of the haft with both hands
close together. With a full-length handle
a terrific blow can be struck in this way;
but what is gained in power is more than
lost in the lessened number of strokes. For
cross-cutting in big timber a shortened
handle would be anathema.

“Toby C.” : A few years ago rabbit-trapping
was regarded as a slave’s life, but modern
methods of working the traps have altered
that opinion. The trapper of to-day, instead
0 f carrying heavy loads of traps on his back,
uses a packliorse with a specially-arranged
saddle on which lie can hang 70 or 80 traps
The horse is led from set to set, a trap being
taken off a s required. The animal soon
learns the business, and after a week or
two will follow the trapper and browse con-
tentedly during tile intervals of setting. The
dog, too, has made the job easier. A well-
trained trap-dog will run a line of traps from
end to end without missing a set on a line
of 70 or 80 traps. This is a great help at
night time; particularly if the trapper is
working strange country. Some dogs will
place their paws on the rabbit and hold it
safe —but gently—until the trapper picks it
up.

“Tomb”: Beginning where “Mapee” (B.
4/8/’27) left off, I can certify that from
Bundaberg to Rockhampton all the ants’
nests are on the northern side of the trees.
Bushmen who have to depend on such aids
to direction would be safer with a pocket-
compass. One rarely goes into the bush
nowadays without having some specific objec-
tive, and there is generally someone who can
furnish directions not given in terms of the
compass. Billjim directs you something like
this: “Want to git to Casey’s? Well, foller
this road till y’ come ter Sandy Crick; then
foller up the crick till y’ see a rusty kerosene-
tin on a stump; take the main spur on
yer left, an’ when y' hit the top foller the
ridge fer ’bout a mile, an’ then drop down
on yer left inter Skeleton Crick; run her
up, an’ y’ll hit Casey's in ’bont six mile.”

“C. Coral”: Just off Mabuiag Island,
Torres Strait, is a cluster of curiously
formed rocks, shown on the chart as the
Hamelin Boulders. The islanders call them
Kamootnab and Goobaoos, meaning the Sor-
rowing Woman and Her Children. Ivoo-
mootnab was one of the several wives of an
old fellow named Kaumain who lived on the
small island of Pooloo. and she was called
one day to dress his hair and shave him.
The first part of the operation she per-
formed without mishap as he sat cross-legged
on the mat: but when she took the sharp
bamboo-cutting knife to remove his whiskers
the implement slipped, and a deep gash in
Kaumain’s neck was the result. Suspecting
that the lady had sinister designs, the old
chap threw her out, and her children with
her. So there they sit, out in the water,
oddly resembling a row of crouching human
figures, while up on the cliffs stands old Kau-
main, a big stone 30 feet high, looking like a
man’s head with a dark mark running along
the neck where the razor-gash would be.

THE HARBINGER OF SUMMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Winter bleak at last must skallyhoot away,
Taking ragged clouds which now the sky
infest—
Where they cannot mar the beauty of our
day
Or shut out the evening’s glory from the
west.
Far too long she’s stayed, getting on our
nerves
With her tiring, chill, drab monotony ;
Now she takes the knock that she well
deserves,
For the first goanna wriggles up a tree.
Shearers will be steering homeward from the
shed,
Sign of season’s turn ere many weeks are
done,
Early peaches next be turning rosy red,
Aye, and amber grapes ripening in the
sun.
Even now you may scrap your winter wear,
Don your lighter togs with security,
For the breath of summer hovers in the air
As the first goanna wriggles up a tree,
Cockies will be pitching soon the sheaves
of hay,
Pouring into bags once more the golden
grain.
Flannelled fools again we shall see at play.
Sheiks and mermaids in swimming-tights
again.
’Twon’t be long, in short, ere Yuletide will
be here;
Dreams of roasted turkey come once more
to me.
I can almost taste the foaming Christmas
beer
Now the first goanna’s wriggled up a tree.
N.s.w.

Why Dunlop gives you extra service!
The average motorist is not much concerned in the method of construction of the tyres
he uses what he wants is covers and tubes-strong and sturdy enough to carry
him many thousands of miles without trouble and worry. Construction ls an
important factor (we use the most efficient methods known) but, from an Australian
motorist’s point of view, his chief concern is that ample high-grade materials cotton
and rubber-are incorporated in the motor covers he fits -to ensure him
satisfaction - and value in miles to repay his outlay. In the construction ot
we put ample plies of heavy-weight cord in the casing —to ensure a big margin of
strength and then protect it with an extra heavy, tough, thick, high-grade rubber
tread that is specially compounded to withstand anything from 7,000 to 17,000 miles of
travel on our roads. There is no substitute for materials and in the Dunlop you
get materials in full measure - and highest quality and that’s why Dunlop offers you
better tyres, extra mileage and greater value. Fit “Dunlop” and you will be satisfied!

“J.H.S.” : The names of certain timbers
vary very considerably in different parts
of the Commonwealth. In some districts
in Bananaland the cudgerie (Flindersia
schottiana), of N.S.W., is known, as flan-
douser, crow’s-ash, ash, humpy-ash and
stave-wood. The Forestry Department has
now renamed this handsome tree Silver-
ash, by which denomination it is already
known in one or two localities. Another
tree with a confusion of names is maiden’s
THE RENDEZVOUS.
BILLY: “Hold on, Mary, hold on!”
MARY: “No, Billy! Mine tinkit I wait for you.”
blnsh (Euroschinus falcatus), variously
known as pink poplar, ribbon-wood, beech,
chipwood, pencil-wood, pencil-cedar and cud-
gorie. The Forestry people have recliristened
it Blush cudgerie. Even the widespread
blue-gum hasn’t a common name, its handle
in N.S.W. being forest red-gum. The
Forestry heads want to have the timber
known as Bed iron-gum; but it’s going to be
a day or two before that title is universally
adopted by bush-dwellers.
* * *
“Gouger”: A thing of beauty
is the sun-bird. Naturalists
call him the ti-bird, but the
ugliest of names could not
detract from his loveliness. He
throws a chest of molten gold
while singing to his lady-love,
and sports a necktie of purple-
black and a cap of the same
color. Ilis coat is dusted with
shiny green, and he swings a
little brown tail, saucily picked
-out with Australian green. The
home of the mated pair, too, is
a marvel'of beauty and ingenu-
ity. Some 18 inches long, it
tapers from a thread to a thick-
ness that will just support the
sitting bird, then tapers again
to a thread. The topmost
thread may be four feet long
and is fastened to a branch:
the bottom thread is tethered
to a lower branch. A cousin
of the sun-bird builds a simi-
lar home, but swings it be-
tween two branches, hammock-
fashion. The elastic threads
are adjusted to such a give-and-
take length that a rousing wind
cannot injure these delicate
yet strongly - constructed nests.
The materials are threads of
fibrous bark interwoven with
wild cotton. The bridal-chamber,
which sports a tiny attic over
the door, is a little hollow ball
lined with down from the
bride’s own breast. I regret to
say that hubby does none of
the work; but the busy little
bride seems quite satisfied. As
she works he sings to her
entrancing songs. And, later on,
as she sits within the cosy home
that swings to the breeze whistl-
ing through hubby’s tail
feathers, she is well content.
The Murray Islanders swear that these birds
are the spirits of beautiful girls.
“C. Coral”: Jimmy Susu relates an inci-
dent of natural history. “Last week I go
’long bush for get some pigeon. I see one
ting I no been look before. One tree, he
got green whip-snake hang down- —he about
one fathom long, I tink. He no see me,
and he hang down liis head. Then he start
for swing all same like small boy on rope.
I see him now, he go right across and back
again. I don’t know what kind ting he make,
and I want to look more; but my dog he
make noise, and that snake be rnn down
and clear off. You tink he look round,for
catch something when he do that., or which
way? Me, I say I know that piccaninny he
get plenty play along rope, but I never
savee snake he get play too! That green
snake he like come for man and run round
his leg and climb up his body, but he no
bite you. Sometimes he climb up ’long you
body and put his head ’long you face and
make fun ’long man, but he only do that
HIS DAY, TOO.
Visitor: “I really must say, Mrs. Winks, I don’t often get such a good dinner.”
HE KIP: “Cripes, neither do we, mister.”
for play. I see him do that ’long one
woman one time, and she holler out for
’nother woman to fight him ’long stick; but
that ’nother woman she not hi£ that snake,
only hit that woman all time. Me, I see
that one, I laugh like ’ell. But s’pose he
that brown snake with yellow tail, man he
no laugh ; that snake lie very poison fella,
he more worse than death-adder, I tink.
“Kayeff”: Recently I saw a novelty in
abo. ornamentation. A young buck, employed
as a rouseabout on a neighbor’s station in
the Northern Territory, had the lobes of his
ears so expanded that they formed a large
loop, which the proud owner wore linked
back over the remainder of the ear. Though
piercing of the ears with a hole large enough
to carry small objects is common enough,
this was the first Australian abo. I had seen
with the lobes worn thus. The fashion is
common in the Caroline Islands, but not
elsewhere. I questioned Wantabi, who is a
full-blooded native, but the only answer I
could get was that it was “fashion belong
father along me—father he plenty walk about
along boat one time.”
& ** * *
“Croesus”: Whatever may be the cause
of the depletion of fish in the Murray, the
result is definite enough. Living in a town
on the river, my household is unable to get
a meal of Murray cod more than once in
six weeks. As the supply is organised for
the Melbourne market, the local cafes can-
not always buy enough to enable them to
serve fish suppers, and very seldom do they
have a surplus for direct sale. When it is
available the price is 2s. a pound—the price
of a luxury for what should be a cheap local
product. * * *
“Matrix”: If the rosella ( Eximius ), now
called the eastern rosella by Australian orni-
thologists, has two wives (“Sandy,” B.
18/8/’27) and assists in the housekeeping
he is certainly a glutton for work. Ma lays
from five to nine eggs, and to help in rear-
ing double that number wmuld be a task tor
a "Titan among birds. But these roselias
don’t generally move in threes. They really
have something of the trait of the crimson
rosella ( Elegans ), which often appears to
be travelling quite alone. Close scrutiny ot
the tree-tops wfill show the mate making m
the same direction.
“Malo” • Like “Sandy,” I have often seen
three roselias flying together, but have not
observed whether they were males or females.
t" t h e re a deal of difference m appearance?
I’ve noticed that when nesting roselias go
in pairs, so the two-wives theory is uncon-
vincing. It is common to see a female red-
back with two gentlemen, however; the dif-
ferent coloring enables you to pick them out
at once. But the two males squabble con-
tinually, and must settle the argument before
housekeeping begins. For you see only one
male feeding his dainty mate when she comes
off the nest for a breather.
* * * *
“Rossy”: The dogger they called Pierce
had come to the homestead for more traps.
Dog-traps are awkward things to carry on
horseback, but Pierce managed to get a
dozen in front of him, and on his way back
he dumped them beside the track at selected
places, intending to set them later on. He
arrived at his camp tired and as glad to get
rid of the last as was his wither-galled
horse. He had boiled his billy when the
newly-arrived jackeroo drove up with the
ration cart. “You’re a nice fellah!” said
the jackeroo, grinning. “You’ve been drop-
pin’ your traps all along the track, you
careless beggar! Here they are.” Pierce’s
thanks added two chapters to the newchum's
vocabulary.
* * * *
“Bis”: What name belong this oneV A
North Queensland snake, dove-grey in color,
about four feet in length and as quick as
lightning. I shot one at the bottom of
Stuckey’s Gap, and an examination of the
mouth revealed prominent poison fangs, from
which I milked a yellow venom that immedi-
ately coagulated. Can't find him in Krefft’s
“Australian Reptiles.” Anybody know himV
* * * *
“Black Tracker”: I’ll back the big white
grubs of the hawk-moth against “Outback’s”
caterpillars (B. 18/8/’27) as bait for cod.
I have known Murray fishermen to pay half
a crown a dozen for these beauties, found
buried in the malice and honeysuckle tree-
trunks.
* * * *
“Vosadina” : The kite fishing on the island
of Dobu is not common to the eleven hundred
inhabitants of the island, but belongs to the
Edugaula tribe of the western end only. It
is not the garfish but the “Long Tom” that
is caught by the spider’s web used as a
bait. Long Tom’s many teeth become
entangled in the web, and _ the only
way of escape is when the line breaks.
According to native legend, the custom origi-
nated on the northern side of the island,
where they never use the fish kite now. A
kite of this kind may be seen at the Sydney
Museum.
❖ ❖
“Eureka”: A shorthorn cow belonging to
a South Coast (N.S.W.) farmer had a
white map of Australia on her otherwise red
body. Her first calf was born with the
same white map, but had a red spot in the
white on the exact graphical position of the
place of its birth.
THE LITTLE IRON HOUSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It isn’t much to boom about, the little iron
house;
There’s precious little room about the little
iron house;
It’s chockful o’ noisy nippers, and their
spirits you can’t douse,
But we’d hate to go for ever from the little
iron house.
It’s an oven in the summer, the little iron
house;
When it rains it needs a plumber, the little
iron house;
And we’re always going to leave it, but no
matter how we rouse,
We’d hate to go for ever from the little iron
house.
It’s six-hundred from the city, the little iron
house;
No one ever calls it pretty, the little iron
house —
But old Dad's tomato bushes (though they’ve
got some sorta louse)
And the stocks the goats have left us kinda
brighten up the house.
Summer heat is most emphatic in the little
iron house;
The dust blows most erratic in the little
iron house;
For the Murchison’s a summer hell Niagara
couldn’t douse,
But the winter weather’s bonza in the little
iron house.
The battery’s thunder always fills the little
iron house;
It’s busy music always thrills the little iron
house;
And we are all still waiting for the wonder-
ful carouse
That every crushing promises the little iron
house.
We s’pose we’ll have to leave some day the
little iron house;
And all of us will grieve some day for the
little iron house:
’Cos once you’re on the Murchison (although
for years you grouse).
You always hate to leave it and your little
iron house.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
LUCERNE ON HARD PAN SOILS.
“Villers-Bret.”: Experimental work on
lucerne culture is mainly devoted to increas-
ing yields on adaptable soils. Victoria’s
closer-settlement scheme embraces large areas
of irrigated land, notably in the Goulburn
Valley, on which lucerne-growing is unprofit-
able. No experimental work has been under-
taken by official experts in the way of solving
the greatest trouble settlers on these areas
have to overcome. This is the presence of
well-defined hard pans in the subsoil, which
prevent the fullest development of the rooting
system of lucerne and obstruct the passage
of irrigation-water to the lower soil strata.
Sub-soiling will relieve this condition to
some extent, but it is very costly, and experts
are divided in opinion as to its efficacy.
Good lucerne land should produce six to
seven tons of hay annually, but on the hard
pan soils only with the greatest care and
attention is it possible to obtain two tons,
and the productive life of the plant is
limited.
What is known as the “watering-in”
method of seeding lucerne is one that should
be more widely known among growers on
hard pan soils. The land should be ploughed
in the autumn and cross-ploughed in the
spring, after which grading, etc., should be
attended to. No more cultivation is desir-
able. A rough seed-bed is the ideal. The
lucerne is drilled on the surface, heavy seed-
ing and manuring being essential. A cover-
crop of Soudan-grass sown with the manure
is a profitable proposition. It will give at
least two cuts of hay, and the stubble will
help to provide humus. The ground should
be irrigated immediately after sowing and
receive a thorough saturation. Mid-spring is
the season for sowing. Lucerne sown this
way will penetrate the hardest pan and pro-
duce crops that will compare favorably with
those grown on the best class of land.
Unofficial experiments have been made on
typical Goulburn Valley hard pan soils, and
this method upheld everything claimed for
it. The environment tends to the slow but
vigorous development of the tap-root. From
germination it meets with resistance, and
there is no encouragement to throw out
laterals at a premature stage. All the
energies of the plant are confined to the
building-up of a vigorous tap capable of ful-
filling its purpose no matter what obstacles
may be met. Lucerne sown under orthodox
methods in these soils develops a spindly tap-
root that reaches the hard pan before it is
strong enough to penetrate it. It either
forks and makes lateral growth or becomes a
clump of rootlets that fail to supply the
nutriment and moisture that a long tap is
intended to provide. Adapting the soil to the
seed and leaving the rest to nature is not a
good business proposition when you want
to make a profit from lucerne on a hard
pan soil.
FORAGE IN SOUTH QUEENSLAND.
“Jeanong”: The Man on the Land who
praised kikuyu grass said not a word too
much. A year ago I sent from here (S.
Queensland) to Melbourne for a few roots.
Although we have had one of our severest
droughts those roots have spread in yard-long
canes, rooting at every joint, till a small field
is covered. Although it is browned (like
couch) by severe frosts, horses eat it greedily
—and scrape the runners out with their
hooves. Fowls and cattle also like it.
We are discovering other good forage plants,
too. A field, beautiful with masses of red con-
volvulus, was cursed by a farmer who now
blesses it. The dry, frost-bitten vines are
eagerly eaten by cattle, which look well on
it. There is an unfounded libel on the seed,
which some think is poisonous. The varie-
gated thistle, too, is keeping cows fat and
well in a waterless paddock—they have not
been to the creek since they had the thistles.
Finally, the creeping salt-bush, which has
not been liked by any of my stock, is now
limp and frost-bitten. The one horse that
has discovered its merits chews the brittle
stems with avidity, and looks sleeker and in
better condition than the other horses.
ST. JOHN’S WORT.
“Gundy” : St. John’s wort or Bright weed,
an imported pest that made its appearance
at Bright (Vic.) about 30 years ago, is a
serious problem in N.-E. Victoria. The plant
flowers profusely about Christmas-time, re-
sembling turnips in bloom and seed, though
the latter is only about a quarter of the size
of turnip seed. This fine grain is easily
carried in the hair of animals. No bloom
appears until the third year, and the plant
is then well rooted. Salt is the only remedy
found effective to date, and the expense has
proved prohibitive to many small settlers.
Some of the well-established farmers and
graziers are putting up. a great fight to
check it at their boundaries, but it’s an ex-
pensive business. Cattle grazed on the weed
become emaciated and feverish and shed their
hair, a peculiarity being that all white-
colored parts first become bare. It is also
credited with procuring abortion. Every
landholder should be able to recognise the
pest on sight, but I have seen it growing
unchecked many miles from the Bright dis-
trict, and none of those I showed it to could
name it. The cocky’s education on this sub-
ject needs prompt attention.
THE “DRAFT” ON WOOL.
“Meum et Tuum”: “Trepex” is afraid
(B. 18/8/’27) that if woolgrowers take
away the “draft” pound of wool the
buyers will retaliate. What more can they
do to us than they are doing? They have
a ring, and lot-splitting is the order of the
day. Japanese buyers don’t bid against each
other. The Buyers’ Association- has a rule
that members must not buy outside the
saleroom. One buyer ignored this rule and
was expelled, but on threatening legal pro-
ceedings was reinstated.
Is there any other industry that sells its
produce by auction and gives away the
equivalent of lib. per cwt., as the wool-
growers do? True, we get our money for
the wool within 14 days of the sale, and, we
expect a discount on articles we buy from
merchants if we pay within 30 days. But
the merchant fixes the price, and he makes
allowance for the discount.
“Trepex” says that wool has to be bought
on judgment. But are not the buyers trained
men? If they err at all it is in undervalu-
ing the wool. “Trepex” further says that
the woolgrower in buying sheep demands a
better margin than the woolbuyer does. But
the grazier, unlike the woolbuyer, is not
always a trained man. He has to pay for
his experience.
MORE DINGO-POISONING TRICKS.
“Slushliglit”: A good way to kill dingoes
is to spread treacle or golden syrup, mixed
with strychnine, on the sheep pads, where
the dingoes are in the habit of running.
When they find the mixture sticking to their
feet they sit down and start to lick it off.
Another plan is to smear rabbits with fat
and strychnine, and tie them up close to
where the dingo passes., They will take the
live bait at times when they wouldn’t think
of looking at the dead stuff. But traps are
surest and best.
DEPOT SHEARING-SHEDS.
“J.E.S.” : There are four objections to the
small man’s depot shearing-sheds suggested
by “Leo Lear” (B. 25/S/’27) :
1. Owners may have to drive their sheep
a considerable distance, which is bad for
the sheep, and over dusty roads and lanes,
which is bad for the wool.
2. The probability of having sheep affected
by ticks and lice or both left in the yards
and pens by other mobs of sheep.
3. Expense. By having his own small
plant the woolgrower can do his own work
and cut down shearing exes, considerably.
4. Classing of small clips can be better
done in Sydney. The Graziers’ Co-operative
Shearing Co., Ltd, which is giving ser-
vice to woolgrowers, classes small clips
to their best advantage for market, and, if
necessary, small lines of similar wool are
interlotted and pooled.
NEW BREEDS OF SHEEP.
“Y. Worry” : There are too many breeds
of sheep in Australia. If we are to develop
our meat trade we must follow the example
of Argentine and Maoriland and standardise.
Going through the Smithfield markets in
Londbn one can see hundreds of quarters
of sheep from Argentine that don’t vary
a fraction in weight or quality. The same
applies, in a less degree, to M.L. lamb. Aus-
tralia should ascertain exactly the best
crosses for meat production and stick to
them.
Unfortunately, the man who evolves a
new breed of sheep, invariably a poorer
type than those in existence, can always
get a following. The late Sam McCaughey
made a fortune out of the greasy, wrinkly
Kempy Vermont, and incidentally spoilt
many a good Australian stud. Luckily for
the Australian wool industry, the owners of
Boohoke, Wanganella, Uardry and other
large studs refused to be drawn into the
“Yankee” stampede. Good advice to the
flock-owner is to stick to the established types
and .let someone else try the fads.
YARDING EWES.
“Jay Ell”: Here’s a method of yarding
ewes and lambs that is particularly suitable
for large station mobs, and does not necessi-
tate the pulling down of fences. When the
mob is getting close to the yard the yard-
men work around the tail with lengths of
single-width calico of, say, 40 yards length.
As the flock closes on the gate the cordon
closes in, and the musterers dismount and
grab hold of the calico. There is soon a
semi-circle of wind-blown or shaken calico
connecting with the yards on either flank,
and the flock must go through the gate. The
stuff, which is easier and quicker to handle
than netting, and is carried on the cook-
waggon, is quickly available for use at gates
(if any) on the way to yards. I’ve seen and
used the method for years and have never
had a breakaway.
BIRDS AS SEED-SPREADERS.
“Biro”: About those weeds that quail and
other birds are said to destroy (B.
2S/7/’27). As a particular friend of quail
I would be glad of scientific corroboration
of the statement. But I am told that “seeds
pass unharmed through a bird’s body and
germinate even more readily than other-
wise.” We have the emu-and-prickly-pear
argument, the mistletoe menace and the
spreading of black thistles by the most tune-
ful and beautiful of immigrants, the gold-
finch. Often I have argued protection for
the goldfinch on the ground of thistle-
destruction alone, but have had the “seeds
pass unharmed” theory thrown back at me
each time. If only it could be proved that
goldfinches, rosellas and ground-parrots
destroyed small seeds, a wealth of color and
song would delight the eye and the ear of
poor cocky. As it is, no method of destruc-
tion of these birds is considered drastic
enough.
NEW NAMES FOR STOCK.
“Hayeworray” : “Leo Lear” (B. 11/8/’27),
who thinks it about time we improved on
the ancient farm nomenclature, lias a
disciple in me. For years we called our
dairy herd famous singers—'Patti,
Jenny Lind, Clara Butt, the Castles sisters
and Dolores were amongst them. Old Dame
Nellie has been a record-breaker in the
butter-fat tests. In the pigsty we used
names of people we didn’t like and during
the war had boars named Wilhelm and
Crown Prince. Billy Hughes was a pet
lamb. A dandy calf with .white feet is
called Stanley Bruce on account of the
spats, and a tall tousled-lieaded steer is
Premier Hogan.
“Hatter” : “Leo Lear” asks for suggestions
for christening cows on more original lines.
Why not adopt the simple and musical names
of some of our common bush-flowers and
shrubs? It would have the advantage of
making the youngsters familiar with them.
Here are a few that are suitable: Boronia,
Laurel, Myrtle, Fuchsia, Erica, Violet, Cle-
matis, Iris, Teatree, Wattle, Mimosa,
Bfeckea. Lily, Cherry, Richea, Eyebright,
Sundew, Mistletoe. Waratah, Bauera,
Lobelia, Marigold. Hyacinth and Lilac. Bul-
oke Bulrush or Blackboy might fit his royal
highness.
REARING CALVES.
“Gundy”: Although it is often a tedious
job. there are various ways of coaxing the
calf to its milk. The usual method is to
allow the calf to suck the operator’s fingers,
which are then lowered into the milk and
gently withdrawn when things are going
right. An improvement on this is to sub-
stitute a bit of rubber pipe for the fingers—
some calves have sharp teeth. The calf
should have whole milk for a fortnight at
least and the change over to skim should be
gradual, the calf at a month old being fed
wholly on skim milk. A little bran or lin-
seed meal added to the milk is well worth
while, and keeps the calves healthy. Watch
the temperature of the milk, which should
be as nearly at blood heat as possible. Never
overfeed.
Should scour occur, give the whites of two
eggs in about a pint of milk. For colic, a
tablespoonful of baking soda will be found
effective. Certain calves are subject to this
trouble, which, however, is rarely fatal.
Poddy-fever and blackleg ought to be dealt
with by a vet. Manv cases are due simply
to neglect and bad management. I knew
two dairymen, one of whom rarely loses a
calf, while the man on the other side of the
wire . fence inoculates for blackleg every
spring and always loses more than half of
his poddies. There is a marked difference
in their methods, however.
111-used calves are eventually represented
by the wretched nondescript cattle which
bulk so largely in country saleyards. If
the owners were compelled to destroy the
worst examples, it would save much suffer-
ing and perhaps induce them to give the
survivors a better spin.
SAFFRON THISTLE.
“Fred Rich”: Saffron thistle, though
generally regarded as a pest, has its virtues
as a drought fodder, and sheep will more
than hold their condition by feeding entirely
on the young leaves, provided a reasonable
amount of water is available. A stockowner
in the Cowra (N.S.W.) district recently
sent two trucks of sheep to Melbourne off a
paddock containing practically nothing but
the thistle, and they "went close to topping
the market. Another lot from the same
paddock was sold in Cowra at a high price.
That paddock has been carrying three jum-
bucks to the acre.
FOAL BRANDING.
“E.S.W.”: Why does “N.M.L.” (B.
18/8/’27) want to throw a foal to brand
him? I know it is often done, but the
result is nearly always a blotched and illeg-
ible brand. By the time you get your foal
on the ground he will be wet with sweat, and
the steam from the hot iron scalds the skin.
Here’s my method: Draft off foals from
mares, and have a dozen or so in the brand-
ing yard together; they will be quiet enough
in company. Have a rope long enough to
reach any part of the yard and pass the
end to the man outside, who will be ready
to pull at the word. Rope the foal by the
neck and haul away, one man outside and
one in the yard. The man in the yard creeps
up along the rope and gets right up to the
foal’s head, and by the time the foal begins
to choke the man covers the animal’s eyes
with his arm so that he does not see the brand.
As soon as the brands are on, the roper
catches the rope where it is round the
neck, sings out “Let go,” and the animal is
free, having been on his feet all the time.
Again, if “N.M.L.” must throw his foals,
why does he need men outside the yard fo
pull on the leg-i;opes? Bore holes in the
bottom rail, at a suitable distance from
each other, and drive strong pegs into them,
letting them stick out four or five inches on
the outside. Then the lep-ropers, each having
caught a leg, can pass the double of the rope
round the proper peg, outside the yard, and
haul in on the end. The man on
the front leg-rope can hold his rope with
one hand and attend to the head with the
other hand, or hold it dow-n with his knee.
SCOURS IN CALVES.
“Hatter” : Has anyone tried an infusion of
the leaves of brooklime as a cure for scours
in calves? It is an erect herb which grows
in damp spots, and was probably introduced
from England, where it is common. It has
always been credited with medicinal proper-
ties, and I have been assured that it acts
like magic in bad cases of scours.
DISEASES OF SHEEP.
Custodians of the jumbuck who are
troubled about the health of the dear little
things can have their worst fears confirmed
—or banished, as the case may be—by
perusing H. A. Veron’s book, “Ensuring
the Health of the Sheep,” a second edition
of which has just been ’ issued by Vita-
lick, Ltd. They give it away, so it doesn't
add to the cost of wool production. It
describes the organs of the woollies and
tells of all the things that can happen to
them, and what ought to be done about it.
If there isn’t anything to be done, Veron
isn’t afraid to say so.
SALEYARD TIPS.
“Almanac”: In his saleyard tips (B.
4/8/’27) “Two Seas” tells the novice to fol-
low the bidding of the man who knows and
get the benefit of his experience cheaply.
But the man who knows the game has no
time for “brain-suckers” and soon learns who
is bidding against him. Once he finds a
“grafter” on his wheel he will trot him. No
—if you don’t know the game, best ask a
regular buyer to get your requirements, pre-
ferably a trade buyer, on a small commis-
sion. He won’t let you down —he’s got his
reputation to consider.
INCREASING EGG PRODUCTION.
“Jack Point”: With increased egg pro-
duction the tendency is for the eggs to lose
size. But it can be counteracted, as is
proved by the performance of the black Orp-
ington which established the new world's
record at Warwick (Q.) recently, laying 354
2Joz. eggs in 365 days. It has been defi-
nitely proved that pullets take after their
mothers’ stock in size of body and after their
tathers’ stock in number of eggs produced.
Both sides seem to have a say in size of
egg, and it is very unwise to breed from male
or female unless they have a good record as
regards size of egg. The primary considera-

How can De Reszkes be
sold at 10 for ninepence?
Thousands have been asking that question. For
years they have known De Reszkes as rather expen-
sive cigarettes of a very high grade. Are the new
De Reszke Virginias, they wonder, really and truly
De Reszkes, possessing the distinctive qualities im-
plied in that honoured name ?
That doubt is quickly dispelled. As soon as you
have tried your first packet, you know for certain
that De Reszkes Virginia r, at ten for ninepence,
fulfil the essential De Reszke requirement—which
is that every cigarette bearing the name must be the
very best in its class. And that is your guarantee
that the new cigarettes will always keep their present
high quality.

The Man on the Land
tion with breeding hens is good type—roomy
body and the usual indications of the good
layer. In the cockerel the type should be
there ; but if he is a bit on the small size
it is not very important, provided he has a
good record for high production of full-weight
eggs. The pullet progeny of such a mating
will show increased egg production inherited
from the cockerel and good type and weight
from the dams.
IMPROVING POULTRY BREEDS.
“J.A.S.”: I have often been asked what
is the best breed of fowls to keep. The
answer is that there is no best. With proper
care and breeding any sort can be brought
to a high standard of production. With the
aid of the trap-nest much has been accom-
plished, but the trap-nest has so many dis-
advantages that it is gradually being cast
aside in favor of the single test-pen. Under
this system there is no possible chance of
the hen’s record being wrong, and the only
expense is that of dividing the pens into
small compartments. A long house, 6ft.
wide, with partitions of wire-netting every
2ft. will give a series of pens costing little
more than larger houses. The food and water
can be so arranged that two pens are sup-
plied from the one hopper or vessel. Two
birds are tested in each pen, one laying a
white egg and the other a brown. Every
stud breeder can have 20 or 80 single pens,
testing double that number of birds every
year. At the end of the pullet year he
can mate a pen of, say, 240-or-more eggers
with a cockerel of high producing strain,
and he can depend on the pullets from such
a mating being high producers and the
cockerels particularly valuable as stud
birds. If no cockerel is used that has not
been tested for several generations back, the
improvement in the flock average is simply
marvellous. Of course, only good, well-grown
pullets, showing good type and indicating
high production, are single-tested.
CAPONISING LOSSES.
“Ross”: Spike’s argument (B. 11/8/’27)
that there is a 50 p.c. loss in eaponising is
all astray. I know a poultry man, S. B.
Leonard, owner of Morlin stud flocks, who
does the job with a kit housed in a sugar
bag, and he doesn’t have any losses. I have
had several roosters operated on, and most
of my neighbors have called on his services.
I sold 150 capons., two months old. at 2s. 6d.
each.
BANANA CULTURE.
“Toonooba”: No doubt the sop-sop prac-
tice of Darnley Islanders (B. 11/8/’27)
assists maturing and improves the flavor of
the bananas so treated; but this is not
the sole aim. The explanation given me by
the Islanders was that, with the advent of
the nor’-west season, flying-foxes migrated
from New Guinea and worked havoc. The
wrapping and binding up of the bunch effect-
ively baulks the marauder. I never saw,
and my photographs do not show, the double
circular design swaying round the treated
bunch, though these mystic emblems are often
erected on decorated poles in the cocoanut
groves. The late Charles Hedley was given
a similar explanation on the Murray Islands,
and lie sketched and described the sop-sop
practice in the Queensland Agricultural
Journal some years ago. As a guest at a
feast on Darnley, I saw many fine bunches
of bananas handsomely mottled with red,
displayed on trophies. This effect was
attained by a process akin to grafting, where-
by a cutting from a croton was inserted in
the stalk of the ripening bunch of fruit.
AN ISLAND ’POSSUM FARM.
“Larrapinta”: ’Possums can be success-
fully bred for fur on islands —on the main-
land it can’t be done because there isn’t
such a thing as a ’possum-proof fence. At
the entrance to Spencer’s Gulf, some 27
miles from Port Lincoln (S.A.), lies Thistle
Island, nine square miles of granite cliffs,
patches of scrub and rolling, open pasture-
land. It is owned by two brothers, who in
1913 released a few pairs of the common
bush ’possum on it. With no foxes, dingoes
or cats to keep them from increasing, the
’possutns bred and increased like rabbits,
until the island was overrun by them.
This year, during the open season, the
owners of the island trapped extensively
without making any appreciable reduction in
their numbers, and the profit made was
enough to show that ’possums return more
than sheep, with little expense and labor.
BREEDING RABBITS.
“Biro”: Why not breed bunny (B.
18/8/’27) ? Simply because bunny destroys
the land he multiplies upon. Where rabbits
have been very numerous for years the land
has become almost useless. It is not only
the grass he consumes; he destroys the grass
roots in a bad time, eats up the seeds and
nips every shoot so that no seed forms, and
thus destroys himself automatically. Of
course he might be kept in moderation, but
even then he would have a worse effect on
pasture land than sheep would have. Even
the latter spoil land that is overstocked,
though not so badly as bunny. Observe the
growth on pastures that have never been
overstocked and compare with others that
have been so once or twice —and profit by
the experience.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Almanac”: Here isf” a simple hygieni-
cally-sound way of using nightsoil as farm
manure. Get a metal container large enough
to hold a pan of soil. In a clearing well
away from the house make a fireplace of
stones, or dig a blackfellow’s oven, leaving
room to feed fuel. Put the container on this
and empty contents of pan into it. Cover
with a flat sheet of iron or a few boards
nailed together and start your fire. Boil
for half an hour, and when cool empty
where it will do most good. Don’t put the
pan on the fire, as the bottom is likely to
fall off.
“Ellen”: Here’s a recipe for a good farm
whitewash: 201 b. lime, 51b. sugar, 51b. salt.
Boil the sugar and the salt together in three
gallons of water until dissolved. Then add
the lime and stir well until dissolved.
“Borom”: Better than either turps, or
kerosene for the treatment of mammitis or
otherwise affected udders (B. 18/7/’27) is
a fairly strong solution of mercury per-
chloride. Care must be taken to see it does
not get into the milk, as it is poisonous.
“Ino”: To tell the sex of eggs take them
into a darkened room on a sunny day, admit-
ting a ray of sunshine through a hole the
size of a cricket-ball. Hold the egg, big
end up, in the ray. Shake gently, lou will
see a clear spot within the egg about the size
of a threepenny-bit. If you want pullets
discard any eggs that have not the spot fair
in the middle. For roosters, pick only those
which have the mark well to one side. This
method will not work with eggs from differ-
ent hens.
“Ino”: To preserve eggs, take a clean
petrol-tin, put in it a pint of lime and a pint
of salt, add two gallons of hot water. Stir
and leave till cold. Then fill another petrol-
tin full of fresh eggs. Stand it where you
intend it to remain; in a cool place. Pour
the liquor gently on to the eggs till the
tin is full and cover with a board. If the
eggs are not to be kept more than six months
the solution may be weaker—three gallons
of water instead of two. After being kept
three months the eggs cannot be told from
fresh, either boiled or fried. They are all
right for boiling up to six months, but show
a slight frotliiness when fried. For pastry
they are first-class for nine months at least.
“Mora”: Should there be any doubt as
to hay intended to be stacked being suffi-
ciently dry, a simple precaution is to sprinkle
a few handfuls of common or coarse salt
between each layer. The salt absorbs the
humidity of the liay, and prevents fermenta-
tion and consequent combustion. It gives
to the hay a distinctive taste, and the cattle
will eat it at any time, no matter how long
it may have been stacked. Four or five
pounds of salt to the ton of hay would be
ample.
“Leo Lear”: Using a knife to cut up
apples and carrots by the petrol-tin for
rabbit-poisoning is a slow game. Make a
solid box of hardwood about Din. deep and
loin, long, wide enough to hold the business
end of a spade. Fill your box with the
origin of sin, sharpen your digger and set
to work.
“Gill Guy”: When turkeys have to be
driven a long way to market they are apt
to develop sore feet. The best safeguard is
to asphalt their feet. The birds are walked
over a tarred floor and then kept in a sandy
yard for a day or two.
“Finn”: Any strongly-flavored diet will
taint cows’ milk. Some years ago, in Port
Fairy (Vic.), butter was rejected by dealers
because the farmers fed their cows on waste
onions. Turnips are worse than onions, and
willow is abominable.
“Hayband”: “ J.G.’s” best handle for a
kero.-tin (B. 18/8/'27) has the defect that
it has to be remade for every tin. Here’s a
better idea. Rivet at the ends a piece of
hoop-iron that fits round the tin as it stands
up. Then pass another piece under the
tin, riveting it and the handle to the first
piece. This constitutes a frame into which
new tins can be fitted in seconds. Also the
frame supports the tin so that it lasts twice
as long.
“R. Mort” : To find out if your soil is sour
because of a deficiency in lime, make a 5
per cent, solution of potassium salicylate,
or a saturated solution of potassium thio-
cyanate in alcohol. Then take spadefuls of
earth from various parts of the paddock you
wish to test, and mix them thoroughly.
Spread out and allow to dry. Place a tea-
spoonful of the soil in a bottle, add the
same amount of whichever solution you
have got the chemist to make for you, shake
well and allow the earth to settle. If the
liquid is reddish, it is a sign that the earth
is sour, and needs lime. A neutral soil
turns the solution brown, and one containing
plenty of lime turns it yellow.
“Silentio” : Go steady with the disinfectant
in the incubator; many a machine-full of
eggs has been ruined through overdoing it.
A good wash with any household soap and
hot water, using a small brush, is all that
is needed after each hatch. At the begin-
ning of the season place a saucer of Condy’s
crystals in the machine, and pour sufficient
formalin over it to saturate it. Quickly
close the machine, and the fumes will pene-
trate every crevice, killing all insect life.
Care shoud be taken not to run the machine
until the fumes and odor have gone.
“Pick”: Th e good results from camping
sheep in the homestead orchard for a period
before fruiting time outweigh any mischief
the woollies may do. They will trample
hard the soil which should be loose about
the roots, and they will pick off every leaf
and twig reachable. But they will add much
valuable manure to the soil, and by rubbing
against the stems of the fruit-trees they
will smooth away hanging bark and excres-
cences that harbor larvae. And some orchard-
ists believe the yolky smell keeps pests away.
“M.L.F.”: This year I thought I would
try growing broad-beans at Bon Beach
(Vic.) during the winter. They flowered
early in June, but the first frosts burnt the
tops black. I just broke the tops off, intend-
ing to pull the plants up later. Soon fresh,
vigorous shoots were coming up, so I left
them to flower. A second frost, worse than
the first, burnt these shoots. This time I
broke off the heads, after which a third lot
of shoots came on. Judging by the pro-
fuse blossom and the bees’ visits, if we have
no more severe frosts this long-delayed
harvest will yield the finest crop of broad-
beans I have ever grown.
“Jumper”: The idea of killing out timber
by stacking wood around the base and firing
it staggers a coastal scrub man. Such
methods may be practicable in sparsely-
timbered areas; but in country where there
are usually hundreds (sometimes thousands)
of trees to the acre it would be as prac-
ticable as felling scrub with a butcher’s
knife. The cost of ringing heavily-timbered
country is from 2s. 6d. to ss. an acre; to
kill by “fire-ringing” would cost nearly that
much a tree in many parts.

In honey-jars and softly-breathing flowers

Disgruntled statesmen—politicians, too—
And bathed in grateful steam of Irish stew;
YV hose gentle mouth did oft the nectar sup
From foaming tankard, deep ambrosial cup;
Basked in the sun on sweetly-smelling leaves,
Avoiding all the trails that man conceives—-
The pop-gun corks, elastic’s sudden sting,
The sheets of stickiness that sometimes

Of all the splendid deaths you might have
died,
Why should you choose my throat for

WHEN KNIGHTHOOD WAS IN FLOUR.
The tornement was drawing to a close,
and the Hated Baron Maurice de Hardlot,
whose crulety had made him detested, had
won all his fights. The sneering curl of his
lip, which was so constant that it seemed a
I’ermenent Wave, deepened as, amid shouts,
the Rusty Knight entered the lists in response
to the Final Challenge.
The crowd, which had been hopping the
Wicked Baron might break his neck, if only
for the sake of his beautiful, unhapy wife,
the Fair Gertrud, gave a cheer, but its hart
fell when it saw the poor armor of the
Rusty Knight and the weak condition of liis
steed. He tide his faithful Hound to the
fense and approached the Roil Box.
“Marry, this is no knight but a Bass
Knave,” said the Baron, scornfully.
The Rusty Knight’s reply was hortily to
hand him his Card, at sight of which the
face of the wicked Baron went white.
The Fair Gertrud, too, turned pale, and
would have swoned had not the Queen held
smelling-salts to her nose.
“’S Blud!” cried I)e Hardlot, furrusly.
“You are the knave who rescued the beauti-
ful Jewess from my house.”
It was indeed He. Unarmed he had
dashed to the rescue when the beautiful
Jewess screamed; and then the man in the
Buff Gherkin had knocked down the Baron,
who would have killed his defensless Foe
with drawn sword. The old Jew, grateful to
the man who had rescued his daughter, had
taken him to his business premises, and hear-
ing he wanted to fight the wicked Baron, had
given him a horse and armor; whilst the
beautiful Jewess, who had looked at her
rescuer with eyes of love, insistered on
giving him her faithful hound. Our Hero,
Sir Egbert Gratehart, had selected the rusty
suit of armor from all those hanging in
the shop because it had belonged to bis
father, who had been soled up by thej
Hated Baron while Sir Egbert was away
fighting the Infidle with Richard the Lion
Heart. After that was over, Sir Egbert had
gone to Australia in serch of gold ; but on
the way Back had had to fight Barbry
pirates who, though better off, had left liis
bark sinking. So Sir Egbert had lost every-
thing and was now poor.
“Bass Knight!” quoth Our Hero, “I know
all about you ! You have robbed me of my
father’s Estates and married my bride, the
Fair Gertrud, against her will. I challenge
you to mortial Combat.”
And gracefuly he threw his glove in the
wicked Baron’s face.
“To the death, then!” hist the Baron, who
was quite angry at this.
See, they have met in the centre of the
lists with a shock that makes the welkin
ring. Both are shaken in their saddles, and
the horse of the Rusty Knight would have
fallen had not Sir Egbert lept from the
saddle and propt him up, immedietly re-
mounting. The crowd cheered this feat; but
they feared for their champean in the next
bout. How could he, with his weak steed,
stand against the redoutable Sir Maurice?
But wait! As again the tumulturous
shout “They’re off” died into breathless
silence as the mailed knights spurred their
horses forward, it was noticed that the faith-
ful hound of Sir Egbert, seeing his master
about to be attacked by his Foe, strained at
his leech, and at last broke away. Just as
the two knights were on the point of meeting
the dog Plunged into the Fray. As he
barked and bit at the heels of the Baron’s
horse, it leapt in the air, and the Baron’s
lans went wide. On the other hand, Our
Hero’s lans crashed onto the Breast of his
Rival, who, with a convulsive effort to keep
his saddle, fell backward and Bit the Dust.
“One, two, three, four, five, six” the
referee began to count, as Our Hero lept
gracefully from his horse,
and drew his sword
ready to continue the
Combat if the Defeated
man got to his feet.
But the Baron lay
prone.
“Seven, eight, nine, ten
—out!”
A great raw rent tin-
welkin at the victory of
the Rusty Knight. Still
the Bad Baron moved
not.
In a moment all was
confusion. Whilst attend-
ants rushed away to tele-
phone for the ambulance,
others tried to unfassen
the Baron’s armor. But
the Blow of Our Hero’s
lans had dinted the
armor so that the clips
would not unfassen.
“If the armor is not
removed lie will suffo-
cate,” said the ambulance
man.
. Quick as thought Sir Egbert knelt by his
side. In his far wanderings he had had to
eat much tinned food, and lie always carried
his tin-opener with him. It came in useful
now, and in a moment his Foe was released
from his jeperdy.
“As great in mercy as in war!” shouted
a mighty voice. It was the voice of our
friend in the Buff Gherkin, who had helped
Our Hero to rescue the Jewess.
“King Richard!” It came as a mighty
cry, as everybody fell down in obesience on
recognising the Monarch.
King Richard, for it was He, was fond of
roaming round in Disguise, and supposing
his people.
“I’m glad you have saved his life so that
I can hang him,” said Richard. “His estates
are all yours, and so is the. Fair Gertrud,
who was not really married to him. The
false priest contest to me on his Deth Bed.”
“And what about the Beautiful Jewess
whose dog saved my life?” said Our Hero
softly, glancing at the girl who stood by.
“She loves you,” said the Fair Gertrud,
gentily, “so she can come and live in our
house.”
Let us look foreword, gentle reader. You
see the happy home, to which the Jew, who
THE FIRST WOMAN TO TURN HIM
DOWN.
is really rich, motors down every week with
chocolates for the children.
You see the King a constant vissiter. He
says he is fond of the grild chops wich Ger-
trud cooks with her own Hands.
The eldest boy is named Richard after
the King, much to the delight of Sir Egbert,
who is a very loil subject.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE gaunt hills, the twisted, stunted
gums and the shabby tin-roofed houses
were bathed in gold in the transmuting
glow of late afternoon. The western sky was
a welter of green and rose and vivid ver-
milion, and the sea was a mirror that re-
flected liquid magic. Port Moresby, frankly
and forlornly ugly under the grilling noonday
sun, had entered upon her daily hour of
enchanting loveliness, and taut nerves re-
laxed, sullen tempers softened and nagging
tongues were still.
Of the three men lolling in deck-chairs on
the verandah of the International Hotel
Patrol-officer Burton alone exhibited symp-
toms of annoyance.
“Gratitude !” he exclaimed bitterly. “Nig-
gers don’t know the meaning of the word.
I took Aliari from a filthy Western village,
fed him, taught him to love soap, trained
him to be a good batman, nursed him when
he was sick, and 3s soon as I get him here
the dirty, ungrateful little dog signs-on to
the boarding-house as dish-washer at ten bob
a month! Can you beat it, R.M.?”
Loring laughed. “Blame the pictures, son,”
he said. “Ahari knows you leave for the
bush again to-morrow, and the bright lights
have gone to his head. What do you say,
Jim?”
Jim Chapman, white-haired and hard of
eye, one—almost the last—of the old bri-
gade whose history is the history of Papua,
shook his head. “A woman, more likely,” he
growled. “Anyhow, a man’s a fool to expect
gratitude from natives. They can’t even
say ‘Thank you’ in their own language.
There ain’t any such words.” He turned to
the magistrate. “Am I right?” he chal-
lenged.
“You are wrong, old chap,” returned Lor-
ing, briskly. “Quite wrong! The trouble
with you fellow r s is that you never try to
follow the curious and unexpected workings
of the native mind.” Chapman gave an
exasperated grunt. “It’s most interesting,
really,” continued Loring, “and I’ll tell you
—if you don’t mind putting up with a yarn—
how I first made the discovery that there
might be something in this ‘thinking black’
business, after all.”
“Go ahead,” said Chapman and the patrol-
officer together.
“Years ago,” went on Loring, “I was
stationed at Mauanari, about a hundred
miles dowm the coast from here. There was
very little settlement in those days—a hand-
ful of traders, an odd prospector or two,
and a few small, one-man plantations. The
white men, with one exception, were decent,
law-abiding chaps who assisted rather than
obstructed me, and our official and personal
relations were most cordial. The exception
was a fellow named Torvey—a slippery,
unscrupulous little rascal, who had given my
predecessors endless trouble, and who pro-
mised also to keep me jumping. Torvey had
scarcely a friend in the division, but for
some unaccountable reason the natives
backed him to a man, and he prospered ex-
ceedingly. The man puzzled me, and it was
months before I tumbled to his game. One
day I visited his store. Torvey was very
polite, offered me a drink and a cigar and
all that kind of thing, and piloted me round,
rubbing his skinny hands, but eyeing me
closely all the time. There were a few bolts
of ‘trade’ print on the shelves, with here
and there a stack of mouldy trade tobacco,
but I missed the usual assortment of scrub-
knives, hurricane-lanterns, jews’-harps, gim-
crack jewellery, glass beads and other things
that natives prize.
“ ‘Me line’s fish,’ Torvey hastened to ex-
plain—‘smoked fish. It goes better with the
niggers than ordinary trade, and. besides,
it costs next to nothing.’
“What I had taken to be a smoke-house for
copra was really a smoked-fisli factory. Tor-
vey explained, readily enough, that he bar-
tered his product, not for cocoanuts, but for
the finished article —clean, sweet-smelling,
sun-dried copra, for which he supplied the
bags. Torvey was a shrewd business man.
He knew that coons think more of good,
wholesome New Guinea tucker than of all
the flash trade-goods of the white man.
Moreover, he was providing his customers
with the wherewithal to trade profitably with
the mountain people, and thus he lifted a
neat profit both ways. On the surface every-
thing was square and above-board, but there
was one point he had not made quite clear.
“ ‘How do you obtain so much fish, Tor-
vey?’ I asked.
“ ‘Outer the sea. mister,’ he replied.
‘Where else would I get it?’
“His offsider, a deep-chested, powerful
coastal native he called Jamtin, whispered
something in Torvey’s ear. Torvey nodded,
and they led me to the rear, where a couple
of ancient seine nets were hanging ostenta-
tiously over the back fence.
“ ‘Every day I catchem fish ’long this
fella net,’ explained Jamtin. Torvey’s eyes
never left my face. Still I was not satis-
fied.
“‘I think you’re lying. Jamtin,’ I said
evenly, ‘and when men lie to the Govern-
ment’—
“ ‘True I talk, taubada,' Jamtin broke
in earnestly. “I no savee. tellem lie.’
“I turned to Torvey, who was wetting his
lips with his tongue, eyeing me furtively.
‘My lad,' I said, ‘d’you think I’m a fool?
Those precious nets of yours are a blind!’
I saw him start uneasily, and he flicked
a warning glance at the native. ‘You’re
using dynamite, you sweep!’
“‘No, I ain’t!’ he protested. ‘Everything’s
dinkum! I see too many ‘wingies’ up and
down the coast to mess about with dyna-
mite.’
“ ‘Take care, Torvey,’ I warned him. ‘You
know the law. If I catch you at that
game, look out! And if you’re not hanker-
ing after a free trip South, don’t let your
natives handle the stuff.’
“I left him protesting volubly.
“The next day Jamtin bowled up to the
office carrying a string of beautiful silver
bream. ‘Present b’long you, taubada,’ he
announced, ‘my boss bin sendem.’
“Fresh fish is always a welcome change
from the eternal tinned-dog, and so I took
them from Jamtin with a word of thanks.
I noticed then that they were a little flabby,
a little limp, unmistakable signs that they
had been dynamited. I closed the door softly
and turned the key in the lock.
“ ‘Now, my boy,’ I said quietly, ‘in the
WELL — ER.
“Has my daughter encouraged you?”
“Well — er—she told me, sir, you owned a great deal of property.”
gaol compound are many heavy hammers,
and sweat drips from the bodies of breakers
of the law who have become breakers of
stones. What about it?’
“Jamtin’s eyes dilated with fear, but he
stood his ground. I bullied him, stormed at
him, cajoled him, all but booted him, but
he didn’t falter, he didn’t squeak.
“ ‘True I talk, taubada,’ he insisted, over
and over again; ‘this fella fish we bin
catchem ’long net.’
“The man was lying, but neither by
threats nor a promise of pardon could I
shake his loyalty to the blackguard who
employed him. And so I let him go. In
my heart I had a sneaking regard for Jam-
tin —he was a sport and a gentleman, for
all his black hide.
“It requires pluck, nerve, a steady hand
and a quick eye to dynamite fish, especially
when a half-inch fuse is the rule, and there
are no harsh feelings on either side when
cases reach the court. If Torvey had been
doing the dangerous work himself, I would
not have felt so bitter towards him. But
I was unfailingly certain that Jamtin car-
ried the firestick and the charge; that he it
was who breathed softly on the glowing
spark, ignited the fuse and sent the hissing
concentrated Death hurtling among the
bream and mullet shoals, while: Torvey
remained ashore and weighed the catch and
figured his profits. And a white man who
comes at that game has .sunk pretty low!
"My fears were to be abundantly, tragi-
cally justified. One afternoon I heard n
commotion in the compound, and the corporal
came striding into the office.
“‘Come quickly, taubada,’ he said; ‘Jam-
ti n close up lie die.’
“I made a dive for the medicine chest and
followed the corporal. Lying just above
high-water mark, half a mile from the
station, we found Jamtin. You know how
these things happen —a defective fuse or a
sweating plug, a moment of hesitation, of
panic and z-i-i-pp—the end! Jamtin’s right
arm was a shattered, bleeding stump, great
gouts of flesh had been torn from his side,
his face was a bloody, hideous mask, and his
right eye had gone. His mates —Torvey
included —had left him there to die, natur-
ally! Nor could they be found when I
sent an armed guard to round them up. I
fashioned a rough ligature out of seaming
twine and a stick and checked the bleeding,
and I bound up Jamtin’s broken body as well
as I knew how. Mercifully he was uncon-
scious, nor did he stir until we had him in
the. sternsheets of the whaler, heading for
Port Moresby and medical aid. I held him
iu my arms braced against the whaleback,
and alternately I tightened and loosened the
tourniquet as the occasion demanded.
“For an hour or more we bowled along
under a steady breeze at a good clip. The
seas hissed overside; now and then, green
water broke over our faces and dried there.
Jamtin was moaning now; a cold sweat
broke out on his forehead, and his tortured
body writhed weakly in my arms. The wind
failed and the police took to the oars. Six
oarsmen in a 30ft. whaleboat, Moresby eighty
miles distant, and a battered wreck of a
man writhing in agony in the sternsheets!
It was ghastly.
“The sun set in a blaze of glory and
night descended. Water dripped from the
oarblades, sparkling like fairy jewels as the
phosphorus played. The police w T ere oozing
sweat, the sound of their breathing came
in tortured gasps, but they toiled on man-
fully, knowing as I knew that grim Death
brooded over the sternsheets. Jamtin was
muttering, raving in delirium, and his limbs
twitched convulsively. Once he all but went
over the side.
“ ‘Let the Thing that was Jamtin drown,
taubada,’ muttered the corporal thickly.
‘The Spirits clamor for him and no man
may cheat them!’ Terror, born of super-
stition, was clutching at the corporal’s heart,
and he shuddered, recoiling fearfully from
the harshness of my tongue.
“I must have dozed, for the next thing
I knew the whaleboat, was skimming over
the water, under reefed sails like a thing
alive. A squall had struck us from the
north-west. The sky was inky black. Light-
ning crackled and flashed in blinding blue
sheets; the wind screeched through the
cordage like a million fiends loosed from hell,
and overside the sea boiled and seethed as if
it would engulf us. Jamtin was lying inert
in the crook of my aching arm in a merci-
ful swoon, the police were huddled aft
munching dry biscuits, and the whaleboat,
with the wind and seas behind her, was
sailing like a witch. We made Port Moresby
at daylight.
“When I returned to Mauanari I sought
out Torvey. He tried to dodge me, but I cor-
nered him in the store.
“‘You beast!’ 1 blazed. ‘You crawling,
unspeakable thing! A man ought to smash
you. What have you to say for yourself?’
“He covered his face with his hands in
terror as if he thought I was about to soil
my hands upon him.
“ ‘Yer can’t prove nothin’,’ he squeaked.
“‘Proof!’ I laughed. ‘Good God! Jam-
tin’s evidence will send you up for five
years, you swine!’
“Torvey’s face went white, and his knees
shook; then with a low cry of hate and fear
lie darted under my arm and scuttled for
the bush like a redshank.
“Months later the wreck of what had
been Jamtin stood before me in my office. At
that moment I felt ashamed of my color.
He had been discharged from hospital, and
had been returned to me under escort, and
had not been permitted to communicate with
anyone on the journey.
“ ‘Now, Jamtin,’ I said gently, ‘I want
you to talk true that justice may be done.
Who gave you the dynamite?’
“Jamtin stared at me out of his one good
eye, and he shuffled his feet uneasily.
“ ‘S’pose I talk true, taubada,’ he fal-
tered at last, ‘you—you make court ’long
me?’
“I shook my head. ‘You speak true, my
boy,’ I replied, ‘and have no fear. The Gov-
■ernment seeks only the man whose wicked-
ness maimed you.’
“Again Jamtin hesitated, rubbing one bare
foot over the other.
“ ‘Come on, Jamtin,’ I pressed. ‘Out witli
it!’ and I slipped a
sheet of foolscap into
the typewriter.
“Jamtin came
nearer and leaned
over towards me. His
scar r e d face was
twitching, and an odd
light flickered in his
eye.
“ ‘Tabauda.’ he whis-
pered hoarsely, ‘I bin
get this fella dyna-
mite ’long ’long -
Hurricane Jack!’
“I gasped, then
choked. If Jamtin
had been a whole man
I would have booted
him down the office
steps. As it was 1
led him quietly to the
door and told him to
hop it. And that was
that.”
Patrol-officer Burton
whistled and his eyes
reflected his astonish-
ment.
“Then, 18M.,” he
exclaimed, “it wasn’t
Torvey, after all ?”
Old Chapman’s shoulders were shaking.
“Perhaps I ought to explain,” continued
Boring, “that when .Tamtin blew himself up
on the beach at Mauanari, Hurricane Jack
had been ten years in his grave!”

The Blue Plate.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two pewter candlesticks that hold
Blue candles, and a bowl of delf
Abrim with poppies white and gold,
Are standing there upon the shelf;
And close beside the flower-filled jar
Is set a sky-blue plate where are
Bright-plumaged parrots bravely gay
In some green forest far away.
What brilliant sunlight filters through
The wealth of leaves—what twittering
And bird-cries; vivid, rich the hue
Of flashing feather, whirring wing.
Mow hot and languorous the hours,
How sweet the honeyed breath of flowers!
Red lilies in luxuriant bloom
That light the green and amber bloom!
A poppy-petal falls. Again
The red flame flickers in the grate.
We hear the sound of wind and rain,
And see, beside the sky-blue plate
With painted parrots brave of hue
Upon the glaze of glossy blue.
The candlesticks, the jar of delf
Standing upon the mantelshelf.

Information Sought.
What scholarships are available for bops
in N.&.W.? Are there any in which prefer-
ence is given to the soils of returned
soldiers? —1333.
Scholarships for boys are open for com-
petition upon the results of the Leaving,
Intermediate, Junior Technical and High-
School entrance examinations. A large
number are available at the Teachers’ College
and the Technical College. In a few scholar-
ships preference is given to sons of returned
soldiers. If the father is employed in coach-
or motor-body-building, or if he resides at
Bathurst or in the Concord district, his boy
may compete for one of these scholarships.
A larger number are open to children whose
father was killed or totally incapacitated at
the war. Department of Education will give
any further information required.
I have been a member of a public-hall
committee. I was recently appointed a
trustee. At last annual meeting the chair-
man ruled that, being a trustee, I was not
eligible for nomination as a member of com-
mittee. (1) Was chairman's ruling correct?
(2) Is there a standard work dealing with
committees of management of public halls,
parks and racecourses? —1318.
(1) A trustee ought not to be a com-
mittee-man in view of the possibility of con-
flict between the duties of each office. (2)
Not that we know of. Rigg’s “How to
Conduct a Meeting” (2s. 10d.) or Palin
and Martin’s “The Chairman’s Manual” (6s.
lOd.), obtainable from Dymock’s, might help
a little.
Does the injection of serum effect a cure
in catarrh cases ? —1398.
Serum injection or treatment by vaccines
is a modern method of trying to deal with
that most difficult of diseases, catarrh. Its
effect is not guaranteed, but it is at least a
justifiable and logical effort.
How can I wipe out aphis? —l37o.
Aphis generally appears in August-Septem-
ber. Prompt spraying with nicotine sulphate
at one to 800 strength—say half a pint to
50 gallons of water should be used. Failing
this, home-made tobacco wash made from
a decoction of waste tobacco in hot water
can be used. (Pamphlet on tobacco wash
posted.)
Is there a special tractor made for mulga-
cutting ? —1413.
The mulga-crusher with Fordson tractor
complete costs £2lO f.o.r. Brisbane, and is
obtainable from Brisbane Cars and Tractors,
Ltd., 324-48 Wickham-street, Brisbane.
What is meant by electrical recording of
gramophone records? —l433.
The sound waves are transmitted electric-
ally through a microphone, and not, as for-
merly, through a recording horn.
How cam I estimate needle-pressure on a
gramophone record ? —1369.
Use a small balance-scale, and weigh the
speaker and that part of the tone-arm that
works from the socket or swivel, and any
other part that bears directly upon the
record. Needle-pressure on a record should
be 61oz.
At what age docs maintenance for children,
paid through an order of the Children’s
Court, cease? —1410.
Ordinarily it provides for maintenance of
boys to 14, and of girls to 16 years.
I employ a man casually to lop off gum-
tree branches. Must I insure him against
accident? (This is in N. $. Wales.) —1439.
Workers’ Compensation Commission re-
plies: Only if the man is engaged for the
purposes of the employer’s trade or business.
Can action be taken against a committee?
Can a committee be fined for disregarding
Arbitration Court awards? —1409.
(1) The committee you refer to consists,
it is presumed, of certain members of the
Shire Council to whom specific duties have
been delegated. So long as they act within
their authority their acts are the acts of
the council; and the council, being a corpora-
tion, can be sued for its wrongdoings as if
it were an ordinary citizen. (2) The
council is the employer of its servants, and
answerable for any breach of the law relating
to them. Answer to other question posted.
How long should the cock be allowed to
run with hens before taking a setting of
eggs for hatching? —l4l7.
At this time of the year the eggs should
be right after five days, but it would be
safer to allow a week before putting them
down.
Does conversion of a N. S. Wales Grown
lease into a C.P. and C.L. give the holder
full control of timber thereon? —1438.
The holder of a conditional purchase and
conditional lease, being a conversion of a
Crown lease, has full control of the timber
on the conditional purchase, but the Forestry
Commission requires a license to be taken
out and royalty paid with respect to the
timber on the conditional lease.
What is a cheap preparation for destroying
grass and weeds? —1384.
Arsenate of soda. Dissolve in water in the
proportion of lib. to two gallons and apply
by watering-can. Care should be taken, as
the preparation is poisonous to human beings
and animals. Obtainable from Anderson and
Co., 399 George-street, Sydney; lib. tins,
25.; 71b. tins, 10s. 6d.
Can you recommend a home-made prepara-
tion for treating a canvas motor hood? —
1479.
One pint raw linseed-oil, 1 pint terebine,
one tube black in oil. Turps may be sub-
stituted for terebine, but it will take the gloss
out of the preparation. Lamp-black would
do, but it is inclined to give the job a streaky
appearance.
I took out an endowment policy with a
young insurance co. and paid £6 15s. lOd. half-
yearly from Nov., 19 z 2, until June, 1926.
Not liking the co.’s prospects, I let the policy
lapse. Is there a Federal law under which
I can recover part of premiums paid? —l47B.
There is no Federal law dealing with the
matter. Some companies issue policies which
carry a surrender-value after three years’
premiums have been paid.
Can a person take another name? What
is the procedure? —l4l9.
A change in surname can be effected merely
by its habitual use and without any formal
procedure. It is, however, usual to execute
a deed poll drawn up by a solicitor, and to
file it in the Registrar-General’s Department
in the State in which the person is resident,
paying a fee of 2s.
Dimensions ( length , breadth, height of
spires, etc.) of the four principal cathedrals
of the Commonwealth — -St. Patrick's and St.
Paul's (Melbourne ) ; St. Andrew's and St.
Mary’s (Sydney) ? —1358.
St. Andrew’s: Length 156 ft., width of
nave 62ft., across transcepts 111 ft., height of
towers not known. St. Mary’s: Length
outside when completed 350 ft., part complete
208 ft., general width 80ft., length of tran-
septs 124 ft., width of transepts 80ft., height
of nave from ground 98ft., height of groined
ceiling from floor 74ft., height of completed
central tower 127 ft., height of front towers
and spires to be 232 ft. St. Patrick’s (ex-
ternal dimensions) : Length along nave and
sanctuary 68ft., height of nave and transepts
185 ft., width across nave and aisles 82ft. 9in.,
width across transepts and aisles 82ft. 9in..
Ditto (internal dimensions) : Width of nave
37ft., width of transepts 37ft., length of
sanctuary 68ft., height of nave and transepts
95ft., central tower 260 ft., each of the front
flanking towers 203 ft. No reply has yet
been received from St. Paul’s, Melbourne.
What are the latest rules of (motion
bridge re (a) bidding? (Is majority or
otherwise used now?) (b) Undercutting?
(c) Chicane points — are they still scored?
(d ) What constitutes a misdeal (does the
then dealer deal again or lose his deal)?
—1221.
(a) Highest value. (b) The English
Portland Club, whose rules are generally
observed, allows the highest bidder against
whom the underbid is made to ignore
the fault or to insist on bid being raised
to necessary level. Whist Club of New
York compels the latter course—its rules
are observed in places, (c) No. (d) Short
deal or faced honors. The deal passes.
(1) Do any sailing-ships traditig out of
Sydney or Melbourne carry apprentices? (2)
Will steamers take apprentices: if so what
address? —1403.
(1) Practically none. A few come in
January—March to pick up wheat, and the
only chance of getting aboard is by direct
appeal to the captain. (2) All the principal
coastal and overseas shipping lines employ
lads as apprentices. For a start, apply
A.U.S.N. Co., la Day-street; Union S.S. Co.,
George-street; Mcllwraith, McEacharn, 19
Bridge-street—all of Sydney.
I have a third of a farthing, dated 1913.
Where was it minted? —l36o.
The bronze third of a farthing is minted
and is current in Malta.
Names of breeders of old English game
fouls in Sydney? —l3B9.

D. Topp, 49 Sanoni-avenue, Sandringham:
11. Saville, Dudley-street, Balgowlah; C. 11.
Somerville, Peat’s Ferry-road, Hornsbv.
I have three books, with many beautiful
engravings, issued by Royal Art Union of
London, 1863. Have these books any valuet
—1231.
Very little; seldom inquired for nowadays.
Art dealers like Tyrrells or Lyster Ormsby
(both Sydney) would offer them on com-
mission.

—W.R.H.
1259.—T0 protect young fruit-trees from
rabbits, tie or sew bagging round the trunks
like leggings. Fastenings should not be so
tight as to hamper growth. Examine occa-
sionally, as the bagging harbors insect pests.
—“Max.”

the bark of the tree is of a paler shade on

on a cloudy day, take a match or thin stick
and hold on thumbnail. It will cast a

determined if one has any idea of the time.
Bushmen can get their hearings by the gen-
eral trend of creeks, growth of moss on trees
and other signs. The safest way is to carry
a shilling compass.—“ Surveyor.”
1363. —To clean and preserve skins for house
mats: Remove pieces of flesh from hide,
sprinkle coarse or common salt over it and rub
well in. Fold the hide, keeping the hair out-
wards, and let stand for a few days. Then
clean, peg to floor or wall and rub powdered
alum well into the flesh side. After the alum
has dried in, wash twice —with a day’s inter-
val between the washes—with alum dissolved
in water. When the hide is thoroughly dry
and clean, soften by rubbing in a heated mix-
ture of marrow fat and castor-oil. —“Yufu.”
1224.—Young kangaroos ar e difficult to
rear, but I have brought up 15 in all in the
following way: Retain in a small enclosure
to keep dogs, etc., away. Let out occasion-
ally, but not before the youngster has accus-
tomed itself to captivity, else it will go back
to the bush. Feed from bottle on lukewarm
milk —at least four times a day. After it
has been in captivity about three weeks it
will require green feed, and this can be
given with least risk by moving the enclos-
ure about on green patches. When fully
grown kangaroos are liable to be dangerous
to children if liberties are taken with them.
At any age they require protection at night.
—R.D.

There are two ways of doing con-
struction jobs such as road-making
and loading; the old costly way of
employing picks and shovels and
the economical way of using
modern machinery.
These are days of strenuous com-
petition, and if you wish to prosper
you should do your construction
work the new “Barber-Greene”
way.
Inspect our Exhibit at McGregor Avenue
The “Barber-Greene” Loader (Model 42)
will load speedily and save expensive
labor, eventually paying for itself many
times over. Loading Lorries, Drays, Carts,
etc., from piles, dumps or trucks without a
“Barber-Greene” is a costly job. With a
“Barber-Greene” the first cost is practi-
cally the last. One of these Loaders
worked by one man has done as much
work in shorter time as 40 men shovelling!
Inspect our exhibit at 207 McGregor
Avenue, Melbourne Show, and have
demonstrated to you what a “Barber-
Greene” Loader can do.

(Price: £5, Post Free.)
witn the new Model 56 WINCHESTER Bolt-action, .22 calibre rifle,
because all the refinements of the highest-grade special target arms are
built into its barrel and action. The magazine, which is curved in shape and of
entirely new design, brings each of its five .22 Long-Rifle cartridges exactly into line with the
breech when the bolt is pulled back. Double Extractors grip the rim of the shell as it rises from
the magazine, and holding it firmly feed it in a perfectly straight line into the close-fitting
chamber.
When the breech is closed the Bullet is seated right into the grooves of the rifling, ready to
take its spinning flight the instant the trigger Is pressed. This means that there is no pre-
liminary “jump” as it leaves the mouth of the shell, and the bore being completely sealed, every
ounce of pressure is exerted against the base of the bullet. The result is superb accuracy, and
the full energy of the particular cartridge used.
These Special Features Are Found in No Other .22 Sporting Rifle.
A leaflet illustrating this weapon, and fully describing its sights, action, etc., will
be sent on request.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
It was planned to give Fuji San a run in
the Tramway Handicap at Randwick on
Saturday—he won it last year—but 70 or 80
points of rain softened the track and the
big bay remained in his stable. There were
14 starters, and Eric Connolly backed
Cimon so spiritedly that the Woorak horse
saw 5 to 2, White Fang and Persuasion
being at sixes.' It looked as if Connolly
would collect when Cimon ran up to Per-
suasion, wdio had done most of the leading,
as they entered the straight, but the mare
was doing the better of the pair when Mul-
labawn (tens) started his run. The English
horse went past them like a shot out of a
gun and had a lead of five lengths at the
judge’s box, Cimon being a length behind
Kelso’s mare. Mullabawn carried 91b. less
than his Epsom weight, Bst. 21b., but he is
a sturdily-built fellow and the 91b. will be
immaterial if the conditions underfoot are
to his liking. He has been a sad disappoint-
ment on hard tracks, but will be a strong
tip on Oct. 8 if the going is on the heavy
side. Horton Gag, a very nice stamp of a
horse, came home attractively in fifth place.
The Chelmsford Stakes was unexpectedly
easy for Limerick. There was a rush to
get on Commendation, it being supposed that
he had made decided improvement since the
Warwick Farm race (his appearance did not
suggest it) ; and he firmed to 5 to 2, Limerick
receding to 6to 4—7 to 4 in places. Son o’
Mine, who was receiving 241 b. from the
Maoriland four-year-olds, had support at
sixes and better, and a few pounds went on
Merry Mint at tens; Statesman, Rosso and
Genuine, who made up the field, were neg-
lected. Percival induced Genuine to leave
the barrier for the first time on a metro-
politan course, and the brother to Lady
Valais cut out the running for six furlongs
or so, Limerick, Merry Mint and Commen-
dation following. Once in the straight, Lim-
erick came right away from his field in a few
strides. McCarten looked round once or
twice, evidently wondering where Commenda-
tion was; and, finding there was no challenge
from that quarter or any other, he did not
exert his mount any more. Thus ridden,
Limerick won by two or three lengths from
Merry Mint, who was a length and a quarter
in front of Son o’ Mine—they both finished
pretty well—Commendation being a poor
fourth and Statesman next. Commendation’s
form was too bad to be true. Limerick’s
superiority on the day was such that he is
sure to he a hot favorite next time he starts.
Yet owners of prospective opponents may
derive comfort from the fact that the watch
showed lmin. 552 sec. for the nine furlongs,
whereas Mullabawn ran his seven furlongs
in lmin. 27sec.
Connolly got back his Cimon losses, with
substantial interest, on Murillo in the Spring
Handicap. The English horse was backed
from sevens to threes, and those who laid
sevens were on bad terms with themselves,
THE WOWSER.
PUNTER: “Bit of a wowser, ain’ chert"
BÒKIE: “Me a wowser! Wot cher mean?”
PUNTER: “You don’ believe in encouragin’ gamblin?”
for there was very little money for any-
thing else, although 17 horses were saddled
up. Always in the first three, Murillo dashed
past Battlement in the straight and won by
three lengths from Tibbie (14 to 1), who was
about half that distance ahead of Valamita
(14 to 1). Tibbie’s prominence at 10 fur-
longs confirmed what the betting suggested,
that some of Murillo’s opponents were merely
out for an airing. However, MeShortodds
had small reason for grumbling, as he got a
“skinner” in the Novice Handicap, wherein
Drake (25 to 1, nominal), Tangible, Lauder
and Woolita fought out an interesting finish
lengths clear of the bunch; also he profited
considerably when Davidson got Winalot. (10
to 1) home in the Welter from Aorangi (5
to 1) and Spruiker (25 to 1). Winalot is
a shapely Rossendale colt who may justify
the late Harry Chisholm’s high opinion of
him. However, he had a much better run
than Aorangi, who was giving him 201 b.
* * * *
Commendation’s showing at Randwick was
so poor that the owner is warranted in
withdrawing him from the Hill Stakes at
Rosehill next Saturday. Limerick will be a
runner, all going w T ell, and so. will Gothic
unless Sol Green changes his mind. It is to
be hoped that Amounis and Fuji San will
also start. The Maorilanders send tlieir
best horses over here and race them against
all-comers when they are fit to race. The
same standard of sportsmanship, is expected
of Australian owners of horses in the same
class, even such as are bookmakers or retired
bookmakers. The Camellia Stakes, the Rosc-
hill Cup and the Rosehill Guineas are other
attractive features of the programme. Some
fancies: —
Camellia Stakes: Vaals or Don Moon, 1;
Aorangi, 2; Triplex, 3.
Rosehill Guineas: Sion, 1; Winalot, 2;
Statesman, 3.
Rosehill Cup: Horton Gag, 1; Coin Nut,
2; Beedos, 3.
Hill Stakes: Amounis, 1; Limerick, 2;
Gothic, 3.
Higliweiglit Handicap: Vaals or Land of
Leisure, 1; Sacedon, 2; Ivoorathella, 3.

There is no Manfred in Ben Chaffey’s
stable this year, but Pitoota is pretty good
and Burnaby is at least useful. This
Spearhead—Your Majesty colt had finished
well in third place in Farrago’s Doona Trial
at Caulfield, so he was a strong order at
9 to 4 for the Coo-ee Handicap, a mile
event for three-year-olds, at Moonee Valley
on Saturday. Lucie Manette (3 to 1) looked
to have the race won at the turn, but Bur-
naby came home stoutly and beat the squibby
Chrysolaus filly by two lengths; Marinero
(10 to 1) was a length away. Burnaby was
artistically handled by Dempsey. He has
7st. 21b. in the Caulfield Cup, and lib. less
in the Melbourne Cup.
Big money coming from the right quarter
for Textile, the son of Green Seal —Bradford
Lass went out a 5-to-2 favorite for the
Budgeree Handicap, the chief flat race of
the day. The Adelaide Cup winner Three
Kings, who was having his first run for
some time, was next in demand at 7 to 2,
others in the market being Homerus and
Thracian at 7 to 1 and St. Lazar at 8 to 1.
Beppinsan (tens) made nearly all the run-
ning, and lasted till the distance. There
Duncan pushed Thracian to the front, and,
finishing more strongly than the mare.
Heroic’s brother won a good race by half
a length; Textile, who threatened danger at
one stage but weakened in the straight, was
a length further lack. Thracian, who is
owned by A. T. Creswick, has been a dis-
appointing horse, but he may do better this
season. He has Bst. 51b. in the Caulfield
Cup and lib. less at Flemington.
So many ’chasers accepted for the £l5OO
cross-country event that the race was run
in divisions. It was the first time in
Melbourne racing that a steeplechase had
to be divided, although it has been done
repeatedly in Adelaide. The Trafalgar geld-
ing Ancient Mariner, who has been pretty
successful at the Valley, was always favor-
ite for the First Division, closing at 9 to 4,
Clan Robert being firm at 7 to 2. No one
gave a thought to Alage (50 to 1), but
with Ellis driving him along the obscure
Alawa gelding obtained a lead of 20 lengths
or more. Clan Robert closed on him over
the last half-mile, and made a gallant effort
to hit the front, but Alage had enough in re-
serve to win by three-quarters of a length
from Norman Falkiner’s big brown, w T ho has
' had a most unlucky season, Reparation (16 to
: 1) being two and a half lengths away third.
The winner, who is owned by A. Sutherland
and trained by J. H. Slade, covered the
two and a half miles in smin. llsec. This
time, fast as it was, was beaten in the
Second Division, wherein another outsider,
the Menin gelding Grey Friar (20 to 1),
cut down Pentagram (5 to 1), who had
been in the van most of the way, and won
a great race by a neck, Johnny Cake (8 to
1) being a fair third. The clock showed
smin. 3|sec., easily a course record. Krigeur
a newcomer, was the successful jockey.

“Town Moor”: The Doncaster St. Leger,
oldest of the English “classics” and the last
of the season, was run last week, and, as
has often been the case in its long history,
was won by a filly—Book Law, by Buchan—
Popinjay. She is owned by Lord Astor,
whose first win in the great Yorkshire event
it was. His successes in “classics” had pre-
viously been confined to the Oaks. Four
Astor fillies have triumphed in the ladies’
race.
* * * *
“Eagle Farm”: Another Queensland
strike may result from the intimation of the
Breeders, Owners and Trainers to the Bris-
bane Amateur Turf Club that they will be
obliged if that body sees its way to rent its
Albion Park racecourse —Breakfast Creek in
other days—for mid-week meetings. So far
the request has been refused. If this atti-
tude is persisted in the 8.0. and T. intend
to build an opposition racecourse in a posi-
tion best calculated to annoy the other
crowd. It only remains for the punters to
form an organisation to protect their rights,
if any, and everybody will be satisfied, the
bookmakers excepted. They’re never satisfied.

“Wang”: “Close finishes!” said Pilcher,
who used to be a jockey; “I was the bloke
fer close finishes. W’y, I ’riginated the savin’
‘beaten by a w’isker.’. I s’pose y’ve noticed
some ’orses ’ave mo’s that any masher’d be
proud t’ wear if they was in fashion nowa-
days. It’s mostly draughts ’as ’em; but now
an’ agen y’ll see ’em on a race-’orse. Well.
I was ridin’ th’ fav’rite in the Stranglers’
’Andicap at Urgers’ Park. Th’ on’y ’orse
our crowd was afraid of was a lanky ches’nut
w’at ’ad th’ curliest mo y’ ever saw. It
was a good six inches long. As we reckons,
th’ finish lies between this prad with the
mo an’ my mount, Prince Albert. We comes
up th’ straight neck and neck, an’ I couldn't
get ole Prince ahead of this Pretty Boy, as
they calls it. We’re ridin’ fer all we’re worth,
me an’ the other jock, an’ the crowd’s
nearly orf their ’eads with excitement. ‘Dead-
’eat!’ they yells as we flashes past the post,
and I thought it was a dead-’eat meself.
Y’ could ’ave knocked me down with a
feather w’en the judge puts up Pretty Boy’s
number. ‘’E was just a fraction in front o’

that Pretty Boy crowd ’d done? They’d
w’axed ’ees mo so’s it stuck out straight in

the judge’s eye. ‘Beaten by a w’isker,’ fair
dinkum !”
Footbrawl
The first round of Vic. League football
closed with Collingwood, Richmond, Geelong
and Carlton in “the four,” in that order.
Carlton, to which defeat meant disaster, took
no chances in its game with St. Ivilda, and
piled up 106 points to St. K.’s 51. ’Wood
kept its system in good running order by
gathering 82 points to North Melbourne’s
56; Gordon Coventry brought his tally of
goals to 88, five ahead of the record he made
last year. As he has two more (possibly
three) games to play, there is a chance of
liis reaching the century. Melbourne, last
season’s premiers, managed to scrape to-
gether 73 points against Footscray’s 66,
which was little to crow about; and Rich-
mond’s Tigers, by accumulating 119 points
to Hawthorn’s 53, stepped into second place,
ahead of Geelong, thus giving the latter the
unesteemed privilege of meeting ’Wood in
the semi-final. Fitzroy crashed lamentably
before Essendon, 43 points to ’Don’s 94, the
all-round weakness of the Maroons serving
to emphasise Jack Moriarty’s achievement of
kicking 83 goals in the season. Geelong,
which hasn’t won a game on South Mel-
bourne’s ground since ’O5, came to town in
force, determined to break the hoodoo or die.
At half-time South owned 60 points to Gee-
long’s 25, but a few hard words from Cliff
Rankin got his men moving after that, and
they returned to the Hub with the hoodoo
smashed —105 points to South’s 95.
The last two Saturdays the Association
has held its semi-finals at the Motordrome,
and, except for the amusement and the
“gate,” nobody is any further ahead, both
games having been drawn. On Saturday
week Preston and Brighton totted up 61
points apiece, and on Saturday Coburg and
Port Melbourne amassed 100 points each.
A draw is an uncommon thing in the Aus-
tralian game nowadays, and for two to
happen in semi-finals is very rare indeed.

LARKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Perce Shelley tried. Bill Wordsworth tried,
and many another poet,
To write the lyric of the skylark’s lay.
Stiff handicaps were theirs, poor chaps!
How could they hope to know it
Who never touched a niblick in their day?
/ heard a skylark say:
“Come out and do the eighteen holes, ’teen
holes, ’teen holes, ’teen holes!
Each green’s a fairy green, •
The fairways paths to Paradise beside the
bright blue bay.
Twit-twit-twitter! Trilleray!
There’s no more godlike scene
Than humans driving from the tee with
heroes’ hearts and souls.
Your mashie shots shall sight the pin,
Your curly putts shall all go in-
Oh, Trill and Trilleray!
Come out and play the eighteen easy, sweet
alluring holes!”
So out I went with sticks and balls and
plus-fours of the baggiest,
Across the links where pretty dickies sing;
And by and by when scores were high and
tempers of the raggiest
A watchful lark went up on saucy wing.
I heard the blighter say:
“He can’t keep down his ugly bean, ’gly
bean, ’gly bean, ’gly bean!
He didn’t flick his wrist!
lie jerked his arms like semaphores beside
the bright blue bay.
Twit-twit-twitter! Trilleray!
His body didn’t twist,
He kept his eye not on the ball, he pressed,
he was too keen.
His stance was wrong, he fluffed his
drive ;
He is the biggest blob alive,
Oh, Trill and Trilleray!
He lifted up his blessed, blasted, blanky,
blithering bean!”
And all along the larky links I’ve listened
with emotion
When warblings like Caruso’s I have
heard;
But I'll yet make him cringe and quake,
though when I’ve not a notion —
I’m going to change the tenor of that bird;
Yes, some ecstatic day,
I’ll make the mocker say:
“He’s done the seventeenth in four, in four,
in four, in four!
A fat five-eighty yarder
That takes a tricky dog-leg turn beside
the bright blue bay—
Twit-twit-twitter! Trilleray!
There’s not another harder —
He’s got a Birdie (bogey’s five), no champion
could do more!
His brassie found a cuppy lie
But sent the pillule straight and high—-
Oh, Trill and Hip-hurray!
Two woods, a mashie, and a putt —the
seventeenth in four!”

After seven years’ operations the percentage of renewals

“F.S.”: Vic. League organisers are per-
turbed at the growth of Soccer in schools,
despite their expenditure of energy and
money in popularising the Australian game.
One delegate accused the Soccer authorities
of subsidising the heresy; another laid the
blame on the Government’s policy of import-
ing English teachers. The layman will be
inclined to think that the fault lies nearer
home. Professionalism and brawling are
bringing the line Aussie game into disrepute.
A little more discipline within the League
would do a lot of good in this direction.

In the final game for the Australian-rules
premiership Eastern Suburbs met Newtown
at Erskineville Oval. Play was lively at
times, and feeling ran hot among the bar-
rackers, who kept the police well on the
move all the afternoon. East, sticking
steadily to its task, led throughout each
quarter, to finish with 70 points (9-16) to
49 (6-13). The club went through the sea-
son without a defeat. It takes possession
of the Masters Cup, as well as the Old Court
trophy, which is to become the absolute pro-
perty of the team with the best premiership
record in this and the next four years.

South Sydney and St. George are to meet
in the Rugby League final next Saturday.
South vanquished St. George with ease
a fortnight ago, but the- Saints have by no
means abandoned hope. The semi-final
between South and Western Suburbs was
played at the Show Ground, and ended in
an easy win for the minor premiers by 38
points to 6. The Westerners, with the wind
behind them, flattered their admirers for a
time, but South led at half-time by 15 to
3, and in the second half its speedy backs
and forwards made hay of the weakening
opposition. Blair, the South skipper, kicked
four goals, while of the side’s eight tries
three were contributed by Wearing, who was
at his brilliant best. Ivadwell played another
notable game at full-back; he lost nothing
by comparison with McMillan, the inter-
state custodian, though the latter was also
in rare fettle. At scrum-half Mason made
a very good showing for the losers, as did
Lindfield, who hooked consistently well, in
the forwards.
The St. George-Eastern Suburbs game at
Earl Park was not so one-sided, though the
Saints won comfortably enough in the end
by 26-11. Their vanguard resorted to rough
play on the slightest provocation or none
at all. As usual, a member of the side was
sent off, but this time it was the full-back.
Meighan, who was accused of swinging the
boot with super-enthusiasm. The Eastern
team, sadly depleted owing to casualties,
battled valiantly against its bigger and
stronger opponents. Saunders, at centre, and
Guest, behind the scrum, did well for the
Saints against a crumbling opposition, the
former scoring three of his side’s six tries.
As usual, Oxford, the big Eastern forward,
got among the goals, landing four and bring-
ing his season’s total to 45.

The Rugby Union season having practi-
cally closed, interest is centred in the Wara-
tahs, who arrived in England on August 31.
The side had a trial soin against Plymouth
Albion, one of the leading West County
Clubs, last Saturday, and seized the chance
to give every one a run by putting in fresh
men in the second half. It won the game,
such as it was, by 21 to 11 —5 tries and
3 goals to 3 tries and a goal. English
critics agree that the team is first-class in
every particular, and are especially im-
pressed with the forwards. The opening
match of the tour is against a Devon-
Cornwall side on Saturday. The Wallabies
of 1908-09 beat Devon and Cornwall sepa-
rately without much trouble, but the West-
erners play especially good forwards, and
generally claim three or four places for
them in the internationals.

Sydney Soccer folk were mightily exalted
when news came through from Newcastle
that Gladesville-Ryde, winners of the metro-
politan minor premiership, had knocked
Cessnock out of the Gardiner Cup on the
coalies’ own ground, by 2 goals to 1, in the
semi-final. As Granville qualified by beat-
ing St. George, 4-3, in the other semi-final,
the final will see the battle for the historic
cup, which carries the State championship,
joined by two metropolitan clubs. This has
not happened since 1920, the coalies having
had a stranglehold on the trophy.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
The Sydney Stadium held about 4000
people (there were over 34,000 at “the
dogs”) when Johnnie Squires (12st. 61b.)
and Jim Williams (12st. 51b.) had their
return match. The splendidly-proportioned
Boer waded in from the bell as if deter-
mined to show that he was master; and he
certainly hurt the coon with jabs and upper-
cuts in' the first round. But as the contest
proceeded Williams scored with clean hits
to body and head, and the S’African only
saved himself now and then by turning Ins
back and sticking out his posterior as a shield.
On one of these occasions he all but threw
ttie coon a “flying mare” over Ins back. Hair-
way through the white man s face was all
knobbly, and he looked anything but the aggres-
sive giant who had started in so forcefully.
Yet he spurted occasionally, and when he did
was loudly cheered. The 13tli was a bad
round for him, Williams trying desperately
for a knock-out and nearly bringing it oft.
Squires smothered and crouched and hung
on during most of the last three rounds, and
he was lucky to get a draw. It was Wil-
liams who was cheered as they left the ring.

“Coon Can”: It was recently announced,
almost with tears, that Stadiums, Ltd., was
making arrangements to return to their native
shores the considerable consignment of col-
ored pug. introduced by the co. ever so long
ago, and retained in Australia until the
Immigration Restriction Act became a bad
joke. One of the coons was sent away last
week. He didn’t want to go, and had to be
chased and caught and bundled on the
American boat. This particular bruiser was
fined a few weeks ago for an assault on a
white. Others have had trouble with the
taxation authorities. Others, again, have
married white girls and added to the mis-
cegenation problem. It is a sort of immigra-
tion which should be sternly forbidden. The
queer thing is that it is winked at by poli-
NOTHING LIKE PERTINACITY.

Stoush and gore were so freely inter-
spersed with flashes of fast wrestling in the
Thye-Ivilonis match at Melbourne on Saturday
that the crowd said it was a degrading spec-
tacle and enjoyed every bit of it. The Greek
started off along orthodox lines, but presently
seized Ted’s head and bumped it several
times on the mat. For this he was thrown
playfully on the press table. A second visit
to the intelligence department so enraged
him that he came back swinging both arms
in the manner of Dempsey. Thye took de-
livery of a few left hooks, and then countered
so effectively that John reeled away with a
gash under his chin. At the bell Ted had
secured a hammerlock that looked a winner.
The third and fourth rounds were mostly
bash. Bridges threatened Kilonis with dis-
qualification, but it wasn’t till Thye had
spread him on the mat with a left hook that
the Greek really became quiet. Early in
the seventh round Kilonis set his crab-hold
going, amidst shouts of encouragement from
the fish-and-chips fraternity. But the Yank
turned the tables with startling ease, and
scored the only fall of the match with a
body press. He was much the better wrestler
when he deigned to wrestle, or the other pug
let him. Weights: Thye, 12st. 101 b; Kilonis,
12st. 71b.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cut Shot": France’s victory in the
struggle for the Davis Cup was a narrow one
hut thoroughly well deserved. When the
first day’s play was over each side had
won a singles match. Tilden defeated Cochet
after a tough battle (6-4, 2-6, 6-2, 8-6) ;
the veteran’s courteraft and experience
proved too much for his brilliant opponent.
Lacoste, on the other hand, polished off the
other veteran, Johnston, in three straight
sets: 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. The Yanks, realising that
their only hope lay in making sure of the
doubles, requisitioned Hunter instead of
Johnston as Tilden’s partner. The change
was justified, the Americans overcoming
Borotra and Brugnon by three sets to two:
3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0. The Eagle was now feel-
ing better, and the beginning of the second
round of singles made it evident that the
crowd was not going to let the home side
down for want of full-throated encourage-
ment. But youth was served : the Gauls, in
spite of stiff opposition, won both games and
captured the trophy for France for the first
time. Lacoste’s figures against Tilden
were 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 ; the American was a
very tired man in the concluding set. Cochet
also outstayed the ageing Johnston, though
the latter made a desperate attempt to save
the day: 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4. The Americans
had successfully defended the Cup since
they won it back from Australasia in 1920.
Counting their triumphs in 1900-'01- , 02 and
1913 —in that year they retook the bauble
from England, only to lose it again to Aus-
tralasia —they have won the Cup 11 times
out of 24 tries. So they can resign the
honor to France with a good grace.
* * * *
“Bounce”: Some time ago it became
fashionable among Australian tennis-players
to set at naught a decision with which
they did not agree by deliberately throwing
away a point. This was noticeable after
the return of an Australian team from
America, where Tilden had introduced the
practice. Public opinion here was decidedly
against the fool-idea, and it faded out. Not
so in America or Europe ; it was in evidence
in the Davis Cup doubles. When leading
40-love in the fourth game of the fifth set —
the scores were two sets all —Borotra took
exception to a linesman’s decision and
deliberately double-faulted. The result was
the loss of that game and the next, the
Americans taking the set and match. The
Basque has been praised for his chivalry,
but to allow an opponent points which the
rules and the officials deny him is spectacular
tomfoolery and unfair to your own team.
It is also rank discourtesy to the flouted
linesman, whose feelings have as much right
to be considered as those of the most eminent
player.
“Amateur Pro.”: The failure of the Bug-
lish tennis authorities to get together a team
to visit Australia throws an interesting light
on the game as it is played to-day. Only
two gentlemen were willing to come, and
in the words of the cable they “are connected
with the sale of tennis requisites.” In effect,
there is not one prominent amateur in all
England who is prepared to make the trip
for travelling and hotel expenses, plus the
usual standard amateur allowance; but tw T o
are agreeable provided they may recoup them-
selves by pushing the sale of goods. We
have more than enough amateurs of that
description already.

“Prop. A. Gander”: The reception of
Betty Nuthall in her native land after her
tennis tour in America ran that accorded
the Duke and Duchess to a short head. The
quay at Southampton was packed with
acclaiming thousands, and Waterloo station
was worse. There cries of “Bravo, Betty!”
were followed by shouts of “Good old Eng-
land !” a delicate bit of discrimination which
one trusts the latest equivalent of Joan of
Arc appreciated. Demonstrations on _ a
great scale were organised in Betty’s native
hamlet, or whatever it is, and doubtless the
bells were rung and oxen roasted whole on
the village green. It seems a lot of fuss to
make over a 16-year-old girl who plays a
good game of lawn tennis, but the breath-
less announcement of her “manager” to the
hordes of waiting pressmen that “Betty
improved her service wonderfully over there”
is held to justify all the tumult and the
shouting.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Stymie”: W. S. Nankivell, a 24-year-old
Victorian who only began to take golf seri-
ously a few months ago, won the amateur
championship of Australia on the Sandring-
ham (Vic.) links last week, beating Legh
Winscr, of South Australia, by one up after
;:s holes had been played. _ During the round
the pair see-sawed in exciting fashion, being
square at the 35th. The next two holes were
halved, and at the 38th Winser had to sinic
a twenty-foot putt to repeat the dose. lie
failed, and Nankivell ran down a four-footer
to win one of the most neck-and-neck battles
the game has provided for years. Nankivell
was remarkably steady and consistent all
through. Edgar, the young Victorian
amateur champion, reached the semi-finals,
and was rather unlucky to be outed. As he
is only 18 he can afford to wait a year oi
two. Winser, by the way, had probably only
himself to blame for losing. He deliberately
duffed one shot when he considered lie had
gained an unfair advantage by the ball hit-
ting a spectator, and so gave the hole to
Nankivell. .....
In the mixed doubles Violet Betlieras and
A W Jackson, last year's amateur cham-
pion of Victoria, broke the foursomes record
for the course with a morning round of <3
and an aggregate of 151. The lady gave a
verv fine display with her iron shots.
* * * *
“Fluff”: As to that amazing labyrinth
the rules of golf (B. 8/9/’27), consider the
case of the Australian foursomes champion-
ship which blew itself out at Sandringham.
The joke began with a nipper stealing a ball,
the suffering pair being penalised The
plovers finished level and the authorities
called it a draw. On second thoughts they
decided that it would be better to play the
match over again. This was done, and
towards the finish the pairs, experienced
„ o lf ers —if there are any such —found that
each had been playing with the wrong ball.
The authorities were consulted again. I hey
announced, with some heat, that they were
fed up, and that the blessed foursomes cham-
pionship would be rubbed off the slate for
the year And so it was, and is, and will be.
'** * *
“E.K.”: Eric Apperly, one of the most
popular players that ever swung wood or
iron, has never done any good in a cham-
pionship played at Royal Melbourne. Nearly
every golfer has a hoodoo hole; Eric sis the
long twelfth at Sandringham, with dense
scrub fringing its fairways There three
years ago he picked up his ball, after hook-
ing two consecutive brassie shots into the
tall timber. This year the fatal twelfth hole
cost him an eight—and his chance of semir-
ing the amateur title. He was only a half-
stride away from getting a place among the
16 amateurs qualifying when destiny bowled
him over.
* * * *
“Spit”: C. J. Moss (B. 8/0/’27), who
has won the Maoriland open championship,
is no stranger to N.S.W. golf. He reached
the Ma State 10 years ago from England—
he was 17 then —and became assistant pro-
fessional at Killara (N.S.W.) and later at
Manly. Going to the Dominion as profes-
sional to the Auckland club, he rapidly
improved his game, and won the Maoriland
professional championship in 1923-24-25 and
the open in 1924. He was also runner-up for
the open in 1921 and 1925.

“Whizz”: Motor-car records have been
getting a shaking np in America. The most
recent performance was put up at Rocking-
ham speedway by Peter di Paolo, who won
a 200-miles event for 1500-c.c. cars, aver-
aging 124.34 m.p.h. in a front-wheel-drive
Miller. Frank Lockhart was second, also
in a Miller ; he averaged 123.1 m.p.h. In the
qualifying tests, in which 130 m.p.h. or
over had to be reached, (J. Woodbury aver-
aged 141.5 ; di Paolo, 138 ; Leon Duray, 138 ;
and 1). Evans, 137.2. In a stock car race
W. Morton, in an Auburn, was first with
09.07 m.p.h. Speedy work for a stock car.

“Gate Change”: The Queensland Royal
Automobile Club intends beginning its
annual reliability touring contest on Sep-
tember 24. The route will be from Bris-
bane to Bundaberg, and will include quite
a lot of unpleasantly diversified country
which should test car and driver to "the
utmost. The trials will last five days, arid
(an unusual feature) observers will not be
required to accompany cars each day. Each
competitor will be allotted 750 points at
the start; points will be deducted from this
total for failures and errors. The com-
petitor finishing with the greatest number of
marks will thus be the absolute winner.

“Garry”: An expert stealer of petrol-
chariots spilt the recipe to me after he had
been applying it with a little too much
enthusiasm. First of all, you buy a car.
You tuck the receipt in your pocket-book,
register the vehicle and get your driver’s
license. Then some fine afternoon you and a
cobber drive round the streets till you find a
mob of cars parked by the kerb, and among
them one of the same make and model—or
near enough—with space alongside for yours.
Your cobber sits in the car while you go
into a hotel and have a few drinks —making
a noise about it. so that by the time you
come out there’ll be 20 witnesses to testify
to your insobriety. As soon as you stagger
out your cobber makes himself scarce until
you have nipped away with the car that
isn’t yours. If there is any liue-and-cry—-
well, you were drunk and made a little mis-
take, and you’ve got the receipt to show
that you do own a car of the same make.
You may be fined £2 for being drunk in
charge or you may get away with something
worth £lOO of any receiver’s money. And
your own car is safe in your cobber’s care.
“Pedal” : The Goulburn-Sydney road race
for push-bikes, which is divided into amateur
and professional divisions, will be run on
September 17. Riders from Victoria, South
Aus. and Westralia are expected to take
part, as well as many Cornstalks. The
event was founded by Dunlops as far back
as 1002; the best time for the 131-miles run
stands to the credit of Don Kirkliam, a pro-
fessional, who put up Ghr. 19min. Slsec. in
Dll. Most of the Victorians are riding
over from their State in order to sample a
long stretch of road from Melbourne to Wan-
garatta. This will be part of the 685-miles
course for the Dunlop Grand Prix, to be
run in Victoria in November.
Miscellaneous
“C.Q.”: Diggers’ bagatelle (B. 8/9/'27)
is growing in respectability. It has now
moved from the Melbourne suburbs into the
heart of the city. Not only that, but it has
a class of professionals. One boasts of rak-
ing off £2 a day.

The Sydney road-racing season ended on
Saturday with the Manly Athletic Club’s 15-
mile race, known as the “Modified Mara-
thon. ’ Alleyn Gainsford (St. George), win-
ner last year, was first again, covering the
distance in lhr. 26min. 27sec.
* * *
“Tenth Slip”: The decision of J. M.
Gregory to retire from the bowling crease,
while continuing his cricket as a batsman, is
a reminder that fast bowlers, as a rule, don’t
last long. McDonald, blessed with an effort-
less action, may be an exception. Gregory
will be worth his place in the Australian
XI for his batting and his fielding in the
slips. His batting average in England last
season was 35.12 for all first-class games,
and 24.83 for the Tests; and he is a still
more formidable proposition on Australian
wickets.
* ❖
“Gwy”: Umpires for the N.S.W. C.A.’s
metropolitan district competition will be
paid 10s. for the afternoon. A Sydney junior
association offers 4s. 6d. for the same job.
By no stretch of the imagination can these
terms be _ regarded as liberal, although in
the first instance they’re double what they
used to be. In more remote years the oppos-
ing elevens were expected to furnish the
five bob required. One season the Padding-
ton club, “as a matter of principle,” refused
to pay the threepence a head demanded.
Probably the C.A. gets better umpires than
it deserves, but for any shortcoming (and
last season there were complaints that the
umpiring was not up to f.a.q. standard) it
has only itself to blame.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: Some of the English
sporting journals are again showing their
teeth over the tendency of counties and pro-
fessional cricket clubs to import crack cric-
keters, usually Australian. The decision of
Arthur Richardson to play with the Bacup
League club, after he has coached the West-
ralians for a summer, has been utilised as a
text. It is contended that League cricket
was founded to promote rivalry between
town and town, and that this spirit vanishes
when players are imported from thousands
of miles away. But financial considerations
weigh heavily in most North of England
sports. Betting on League cricket is as hot
and heavy as it is in League or Soccer foot-
ball. And when it comes to getting the
other chap’s brass, the canny Northerner
takes all possible care to see that the going
is made as good for himself as can be. For
that purpose he would cheerfully import
cricketers from Papua or Terra del Fuego,
so long as he was satisfied as to the outcome;.
* :'= * *
“Machete” : There are opportunities these
days for has-been cricketers whose imagina-
tion does not outrun their memory of facts
of the rose-clouded past that lies beyond the
year 1895. The N.S.W. Cricket Association,
now in its 71st year, wishes to compile a
book dealing with its pedigree and perform-
ances, but is short of records prior to the
year named. It is anxious to secure the
help of private individuals who have pre-
served reports of happenings in the days
when cricket was cricket, and not the en-
durance test that it has developed into since
the old brigade grew r too old to play and had
to fall back on talk. Anyone who can help
is asked to write to the secretary of rlie
C.A., George-street, Sydney.
* * * *
“Fed Up”: The annual attempts by fat
females to swim the English Channel' have
achieved the usual maddening prominence in
the cables. The other day half a foot of
space was given by the dailies to describ-
ing how Mrs. Avoir-Dupois, who crossed
from France to England last year, wept
when she failed to do the return journey. A
new horror has been added to the situation
by the swimming of the Bristol Channel by
a Welsh flapper. The only hone of relief
seems to lie in the probability that the
Transatlantic flying-craze will extend to the
female Channel swimmers. Perhaps some
newspaper will arrange a swim from Queens-
town to Sandy Hook, the competitors to start
in one batch, and to be escorted out of sight
of land by warships and left to their own
devices.
* * * *
“Gooseflesli” : People who take their daily
dip in the winter surf of Australia missed
a fine chance when none of them attended
the swimming Marathon held on Canada’s
Lake Ontario. The distance was 21 miles,
and 250—one a Maorilander—started, but
owing to the deadly cold only three finished.

football team, which narrowly missed

numerous swimmers of the English Channel
last year, finished first in llhr. 43min. He
was two miles ahead of the next half-frozen
frog, a Frenchman named Michel; Ericksen.
a Yank, was the other. The prizes were
worth 50,000 dollars, or so it is alleged.
“Blade”: Though Goodsell won his race
against Barry at Vancouver with ridiculous
ease, another challenge has been issued by
the Englishman, and the Sydney youth has
accepted it. The money is evidently good
over there. Goodsell’s first big title was the
N.S.W. amateur, won when he was only 18!
He tackled Jim Paddon, as a professional,
at Woodbnrn (N.S.W.) in 1924, and was
beaten. Jim having retired, the youngster
defeated McDevitt on the Clarence in the
following year for the world’s title, and lias
held it against four challengers, including
1 addon, who tried to come back, and Maori-
land s Hannan. He has never been seri-
ously threatened by his rivals since he

reached the top and is undoubtedly one of
the greatest professional scullers this coun-
try has produced.
“Koolonga” : The coming Henley-on-Yarra
promises to be a gathering of the crack
oarsmen of Australasia. Waitemata (M.L.)
is sending its best four across for the
Stewards’ Challenge Cup, and crews from
Toowong (Q.), Renmark (S.A.), Swan River
(W.A.) and Franklin (Tas.) are expected.
In the Grand Challenge for eights Tamar
(Tas.), Mosman (N.S.W.) and Melbourne
(Vic.) should provide some tine rowing.
Watermen are keen to see the result of this
particular clash, differing methods of coach-
ing being involved. Incidentally, a young
member of the harvester McKay family is
stroking one of the Yic. fours in training
for the Stewards’ Challenge Cup.
* * *
“Blade Sight” : A cable informed us the
other day that Warrant-Officer Shearim, a
well-known figure in the N.S.W. section of
the Australian Instructional Corps, had won
the King’s medal as the champion shot of
the Australian military forces. Someone has
blundered. The medal is given for the
best shot among the military forces of the
Empire, and Shearim was sent to Britain
to represent Australia. So it looks as if
this country has yet another to add to its
long list of triumphs abroad with the target
rifle.
“.Tinker”: Twenty-odd two-up players were
fined the other day in my neighborhood for
engaging in what the prosecuting-sergeant
designated “an unlawful and. unfair” game.
It was the sergeant’s second barrel that
hurt, for coin-gazers stoutly maintain that
no other gamble is as fair; and they have
grounds for their contention. Compared
with faro, poker, banker and other card games,
the opportunities of cheating at two-up are
small. The rule that anyone may inspect
the coins at will, catch them as they fall, or
pick them up after the spin reduces the
scope for unfair tactics to a minimum.
There is no such aid to dishonesty as “longs
and shorts” —the deadly banker pack in
which the ends of the high cards are pared
down so that the low cards project, the
trickster being thus enabled to cut all the
low cards when setting down the packs.
Neither is there anything comparable to
“strippers,” “readers,” “benders” and a host
of other contrivances, any of which would
scuttle the banking account of a Pierpont
Morgan. The Prince of Wales, when playing
behind the Australian lines in France, pro-
nounced two-up the fairest of all games;
and, incidentally, he was no mean hand with
the kip. In Queensland some years back the
game was adjudged to be legal. This was
brought about through the agency of a gent,
in dungarees who, when herded in court with
other delinquents, offered to demonstrate to
the Bench that it was a game of skill. He
was afforded the opportunity to prove his
words, and headed ’em first barrel.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Harold Hardupp”: Australian sharks,
marine species, are due for a bad time. The
yacht Ishtar has been fitted up as a shark-
hunter and a sort of floating factory, and
little of brother shark will go to waste once
lie is landed. British money is behind the
enterprise, and a start will be made in Nortli-
Westralia.
* * * *
“Hopeless Horace”: When I was getting
my watch out of pawn my accommodating
friend Duncan O’Cohen asked how I had
contrived it. I explained that I had had a
good week free-lancing for The Bulletin,
Said Isadore, thoughtfully: “Deb Buli.e-
teen he is all righdt; bud vy does he call
der column TVesiness Boppory?’ Aindt it
der same t’ing?”
* * * *
“Buna”: The mineralised mud found in
parts of Rotorua (M.L.) has been anything
but a profit in its own country outside the
thermal region. England has, however,
discovered its virtues; a preparation from
Ngongotaha is having a brisk sale as a
face-powder with special properties. It is
expected that the demand will extend to
Whakarewarewa mud, which is good for
sunburn and skin irritations.
=!-- * * *
“FY7”: Reports of the Brisbane skin
sales show how fur hunters anticipated the
zero hour for the slaying of native-bears. The
open season began on August 1 and closed
on August 31. Yet 223,510 skins came on
the market, and large stocks were held over
for the next sale. The butchery will go on
“under the lap” and Billy Bluegum will
eventually be exterminated unless the Com-
monwealth Government prohibits the export
of skins.
* * * *
“Forward”: Customs Minister Pratten's
announced intention of encouraging the
artificial-silk industry in Australia brought
a wail from woolgrowcrs in the Riverina.
It is an irrational attitude. Art. silk can-
not be used for making blankets, rugs, over-
coats, suits or anything of the kind. It is
already as much of a menace to wool as it is
ever likely to be, only the stuff is now
imported. Much better to have it manufac-
tured here. Better for the woolgrowcrs as
well as the rest of us.
* :? * *
“Exhibition Street”: In Victoria, which
supports more herbalists and Chinese doc-
tors in proportion to population than any
other part of the Empire, the Pull Court
has refused osteopaths the right to describe
themselves as “doctors.” The parties con-
cerned have flourishing practices in Mel-
bourne. In the Court’s opinion their posses-
sion of degrees from American Universities
was immaterial. The opinion cost each appel-
lant 10 guineas in costs, to say nothing of
the amount dropped on the road from the
P.M. to the Big Wigs.
* * * *
“ILK.”: One of those philanthropists
who arrange loans for Government railway-
men was a witness in the N.S.W. Bank-
ruptcy Court the other day. For advances
of fl liis cut was 3d. to Gd. a fortnight,
according to circumstances. But most
money-lenders who accommodate Government
servants without security are on a much
better wicket. The usual charge is 10s. a
fortnight for the loan of £3 —140 p.c. p.a.
Agents recruited from inside the service are
paid 10 p.c. to secure clients for Blood-
suckers, Ltd.: the collectors hovering around
on pay-day also receive 10 p.c. This branch
of usury is kept going mainly by youngsters
who punt on the ’oases and the ponies and
the tin hares. Some youths have been pay-
ing 10s. a fortnight for as long as nine
months, being unable to save the necessary
£3.
$ $ Hi ❖
“P.X.”: There’s many a slip ’twixt the
cheque-book and the sure 1.0 per cent. A
while ago there was a small rush of parking
stations on the market, and, of course,
one co. was floated in Adelaide. Beforehand,
the promoters saw the manager of “a lead-
ing financial institution,” who told them that
his concern was good for a 50 p.c. advance
on the land and premises. So the co. was
formed and the land was bought and the
buildings on it were pulled down ; and then
the directors held out their hands for the
advance to help with the re-building. But by
this time, conditions had changed and there
was nothing doing. Left with a bare slice
of ground which was bringing in nothing
but rate notices, the co. could only appeal
to shareholders to back up their money
already in the business with some 8 p.c.
debenture capital—£3o,ooo of it—and this
issue is now on the market. The moral seems
to be: A loan in the hand is worth two in
the. mouth of even a leading financial insti-
tution. There is probably another one—for
investors: When you apply for shares in a
co. to cut green cheese from the moon, be
sure you can see enough money subscribed
to buy a ladder long enough to get there.

Authors’ Week broke in the Turner Hail
of Sydney Technical College on a fair augury
—a September afternoon warm with sun-
shine and rich in bud and promise; an 1
G. B. Philip, who has proved an energetic
and inspiring president, opened proceedings
with a speech so flattering to the Australian
author that publisher George Robertson, who
was seated on the platform, became the
focus of the eye of every beginning poet
and novelist in the assembly. It was a
sort of unspoken “There, do you hear that?
Now, what about bringing out this stupen-
dous work of mine?”
The walls of the hall are a sort of Bul-
letin portrait gallery. Here live in example
and in caricature “Hop,” Henry Lawson,
Arthur Adams, Phil May, Lamoert and a
string of other brilliant writers and artists
whose work was introduced to Australia
through Bulletin pages. Black-and-white
drawings by Bulletin artists such as Vin-
cent, Norman Lindsay, Leason, Lionel and
Percy Lindsay and “Hop” occur all around
the rooms; and a collection of photographs
of Australian authors by May Moore are
striking for their strength combined with
sensitive detail. This is particularly
noticeable in the studies of Kendall, Lawson
and Roderic Quinn.
A fine collection of early publications has
been loaned by the Mitchell Library. There’s
a sketch of the cottage at Gosford in which
Kendall lived, and naturally coupled with the
poet’s name is that of the Pagan family.
Charley Bean, poet Will Lawson, R. Kale-
ski, Steele Rudd, Ethel Turner, Le Gay
Brereton and Sydney Ure Smith were among
those who applauded the movement by their
presence. City-Librarian Bertie and Nature-
lover A. H. Chisholm gave the first evening’s
addresses. But these addresses should not
last more than 20 minutes. The two speakers
occupied two hours, without an intermission,
on Monday evening, with the result that
nohody had time to examine the exhibits.
The Education Galleries overflowed on
Saturday with artistic people in inartistic
clothes and with inartistic people in artistic
raiment eager to view the Society of Artists’
Show long before it was time for Anthro-
pologist Radcliffe Brown, to say his open-
ing piece. This came as something in the
nature of a broadside to the newspaper
people waiting with pen poised for his words ;
the Prof, prophesied that one fine day the
journalist would approach his subject with
at least a show of intelligence. Apparently,
looking round the walls, he decided that
it was hopeless to expect this of the artists;
anyhow, he didn’t pay them the same com-
pliment. The Professor, by the way, shows
little or nothing of that shining sartorial
splendor with which he first, dazzled Sydney;
and as for his observations on Art—“ Kinde-
rgarten stuff! Kindergarten stuff!" a pat-
riarch rumbled in His beard. And the old
boy was very nearly right.
President of the society Syd Smith wore a
grey suit and a pearl pin, and Thea Proctor
wore a hat and a cape whose pattern she
had borrowed from the Witch in “Macbeth.”
However, her water-color portrait of fair-
haired Hannah Jones was much admired,
even when the original stood by in a sand-
colored jumper-suit warmed by furs of
b’onde complexion. Dr. Constance D’Arcy
was cosy in black furs; and Albert Collins,
who asked a girl visitor if she had seen
“A Hot Night,” leaped back like a startled
fawn when she replied that she hadn’t but
■was looking forward to “A Night of Love”
next week. John Lane Mullins walked amidst
his family; and there w r ere Sheldons and Bar-
lows ; and black-and-white artist Souter
squired his best girl. Mrs. Basil Foulds was
again an attraction; and so w r as Judge
Rolin’s widow. Sables w 7 ere worn by Mrs.
Sep Levy, and black velvets by Mrs. A. E.
Hughes. A young man with red waving hair
and Oxford bags brought a stained-glass-win-
dow type of beauty. He turned out to be a
brother of dancer Cyril Ritcliards and an
artist in his own right. Wat Taylor was
there, and Adrian Feint, and Roy de Mestre,
who had a girl in toW as attractive as his
own flower-piece. There was also a lady
riding to win in a crimson jumper striped
and barred like a jockey’s; and on t'e walls
there was a lady with a sponge at 250
guineas, but a little less no doubt if one
didn’t take the sponge.
Last week Sydney had some educational
uplift. From Sunday to Saturday the plain,
unlettered public was invited to hobnob with
the most learned pundits of Sydney Uni-
versity. Of course it was at a price, but
still one bob can’t be said to be an excessive
charge for even a very small uplift. The
money goes to the old institution which,
now in its 75th year, with democratic ideas
making larger demands upon it and the
pound bringing less and less, stretches out
a hand that its grey hairs may not be
brought in sorrow to the bankruptcy court.
All the week the corridors and cloister-like
walks echoed to the tread of men and
women whose households are guiltless of even
a B.Sc.; and on Friday night, in spite of
icy rain, whole families shudderingly walked
along the ways lit by festoons of electrics
from Great Hall (it suggested a cosy
corner under the regime of Lady Macbeth)
to Fisher Library, and in and about the
Union —the refectory about as bare of food
from the day’s rush as was any monastery’s
after a visit of Cromwell’s men. Small boys
crowded out the Mental Test department,
and shrieked over the X-rays, and mothers
and fathers listened-in for a few minutes
at lectures on the subjects which son and
daughter were “taking up.”
But the Fisher Library was the popular
exhibit. Every man can understand books
and pictures. And there is something noble
in the setting of the Great Hall, for the
ceiling of which a young forest of Lebanon
was grown. Its make-up reads like an item
of one of Hiram of Tyre’s accounts to King
Solomon: “300 cedar logs, 16ft. long, 3ft.
thick.” The original lighting seems to have
been the equivalent of that used by the only
rival to Brigham Young. However, modern
reading-lamps supply overhead deficiencies,
and the reproductions of Rembrandt, Van
Dyck, Rubens and Romney, and of older
Masters, people the mediaeval hall with ladies
and gentlemen who seem at home in their
surroundings.
A vivid set of prints depicting the life of
a young lady of fashion in Tokio were a
delight: another which shows a lady at a
window writing a poem to cheer a discon-
solate lover who is watching her house
believing she is untrue held a naive charm.
Kimonos soberly handsome in black and gold,
or gay and flowering as some poem of spring,
in the grey bines that suggest distance, in
the delicate lilac that whispers of dreams,
drew every woman’s gaze. The department
of Oriental studies was hung about with
long slender pictures in which a thousand
details seemed in movement, or in which a
cloud and some water with a fish embodied
the whole of a summer day. Here, too,
treasures in gold lacquer and mother-of-
pearl and daggers and swords in the cruel
beauty of steel were seen as through a glass
darkly, for, alas for one suddenly assailed
with kleptomania, a set of trays and tea
bowls in gold lacquer smiled in security
with their fellows within a locked case.
This is a Dayne picture of Mrs. Kearns
Batchelor, organising secretary for the Kari-
tane Mothercraft Appeal. The Karitane
system o t
b a b y-feeding
and nursing
was evolved
by Maorilaiid
expert Truby
King, and its
results from
Auckland t o
Stewart
Island are an
amazingly low
rate of infant
mortality. In-
troduced t o
Australia, i t
is doing splen-
did things in
Sydney, too.
The committee
for the N. S.
Wales head-
quarters is
busy working
up a fair of
great and gay proportions to be held in the
grounds of the home at Woollahra on
Nov. 19.
Last week a faithful band of admirers
of poet Henry Lqwson made a pilgrimage
to his grave at Waverley Cemetery. It is
five years since the singer closed his tragic
eyes for the last sleep in the grave that
once had .been Kendall’s. Melbourne, too,
not the Melbourne of Toorak, but the Mel-
bourne of Footscray, honored the memory
of the dead poet. Much more than bad smells
are manufactured in this suburb; the first of
the Lawson potpourri was mixed there
five years ago, and the latest gathering, as
it listened to some of Lawson’s lines,
might have thought of Footscray Park where
the ceremony was held: “You may break
you may shatter the vase as you will, But
the scent of the roses will cling to it still!”
Forty years ago no young writer or artist
in Sydney needed an introduction to P. J.
Iloldsworth. Besides being something of a
poet himself he was the friend-in-need to
them all, and his sympathy and encourage-
ment never failed. His son, another P. J.
Holdsworth, lives at Rose Bay, and his proud-
est possessions are the plaster cast of “Hop”
by Phil May and the other of Phil May
by “Hop.” “Hop” gave them to the original
P.J. away back in ’BB, and their present
owner believed, until the other day, they were
the only two in existence. That old “P.J.,”
“Hop” and Edmund Barton were among the
founders of the Athenaeum Club when it had
its home in Hunter-street, and he was
secretary, for love, of the venture long before
the days of the magnificence of the Castle-
reagli-street building.
The bright-faced original of this little pic-
ture is the Kiddies’ Playmate. Her other
name is Zoe Benjamin, and she is at pre-
sent acting principal of the Kindergarten
Training Col-
lege. Always a
lover of chil-
dren, Miss
Benjamin has
devoted her
talents and
sympathies for
some years to
making the
lives of young-
sters from the
hot and
closely - packed
streets of the
poorer suburbs
happy and
carefree during
their kinder-
garten hours.
The Union,
with its objec-
tive of one new
school a year,
is her pet
enthusiasm, and her immediate aim is _to
establish combined play and training
centres for crippled children. A film show-
ing the kindergarten way with crippled chil-
dren as well as with healthy brother and
sister is being made under her direction, and
should prove one of the biggest draws in the
Union’s appeal.
The Dental Students long for an auto-
matic lift (as their victims do sometimes
when a tooth has to* be drawn), so one
night last week the Undergrads exchanged
filling and stopping at the Dental College
for frilling and hopping at the Ambassadors.
Here a dance raged to benefit the Lift fund ;
and here the youthful gum-diggers, partnered
by their best girls, seemed imbued with the
idea that the more foot-slogging they put in
the sooner they would have their press-the-
button service. The plumage was unusually
sleek and colorful. President Mrs. Edmund
Gates hostessed a large party in mauve georg-
ette toning with a sort of floral maypole
that bloomed on the centre of her table.
From this white and mauve streamers ran
gaily to each guest’s place, there picking up
moorings of violets and sweet-peas. A cerise
and white ribbon gadget acted as a com-
mittee indicator and was worn by Mrs.
A. Arnott, Mrs. Stuart Henderson and Mrs.
Darvell Hunt; secretaries Grace Jewell arid
Margaret Ogilvie, and treasurers Mrs. Rutter
and Mrs. Vennard. President of the Dental
Board W. Patterson brought Mrs. Patter-
son, in rose and silver; President of the
Undergrads’ Association C. R. Laverty was
at the official table with Dr. and Mrs. Charl-
ton, the Professorial Pedens, Prof. Fairfax
Reading, Mrs. Arnott wrapped in dewy rose
velvets, and Mrs. Fancis sustaining silver
lace and lilac georgettes.
The cabaret in aid of the Adult Deaf
and Dumb hostel will possess the Ambassa-
dors on October 4. From two o’clock bridge
and mah-jongg tables will be available.
Shirley Bavin, whose mother is one of those
at the helm, is helping six girl pals to keep
the flag flying by selling cigarettes and
powder-puffs of the best quality.
Queenslanders in Sydney should turn out
in force to farewell Jeanette Ethelston, the
lyric soprano from the North who is setting
out to conquer England and the U.S.A.
Jeanette’s voice is one,of sunshine and sweet-
ness, and her concert at the Con. on October
8 is sure of all the ingredients of success
except one—the audience. You can supply
that.
That institution which appeals so poign-
antly to us all, the Ryde Home for Incur-
ables. will benefit by the weight-reducing
tactics of about 700 humans who pushed
their way through a crowded Wentworth one
night last week. Every nook and cranny
of the Church Hill hostelry was a congested
area, and in the grand push-round it was
weight that told. Various city insurance
companies had organised the dance, and
active workers were L. C. Brown. Mabel
Dansey, Edith Piggott, G. M. Cadden and
R. Fountain. The matron of the home. Miss
Ocock, and Matron Saveli, of the Cancer
Home, were notable among the night’s
dancers.
Bridge enthusiasts will submerge the
Carlton on October 12. That’s the date
fixed for the drive in aid of the Limbless
Soldiers’ Aquatic Club. Knight Henry
Braddon and Chief Justice Street’s lady are
the head serangs.
Two successes of the week were the Typists’
Ball at the Palais and the Remembrance
Ball at the Wentworth. By means of the
first five cots will again be kept going
at the Children’s Hospital. From the three
previous dances over £lOOO had been raised
and last week’s effort will send the total up
with a rattle. Cassie Crouch was the sec-
retary and Kitty Hill the publicity officer.
The Remembrance Ball dropped a few doub-
loons into the Sailors and Soldiers’ Fathers’
Association funds. These are used in the
interests of returned men physically or
financially disabled, so the crowded' Went-
worth was a joy to the committee, of which
ex-Minister Sydney Smith was president and
Mrs. K. Burrell organiser.
The musical Cherniavskys, Michel, Jan
and Leo. like Australia so well that they
are bringing their wives to see it: It wiil
be a family party, although the children
will be left at home —Michel lias three and
.Tan two ■ Leo is only recently married. The
Musical trio, now in Mexico, are booked for
four weeks in the United States in Novem-
ber. February will see them in Maoriland.
They will come on to Sydney in March.
Incidentally, Howard Edie, who piloted
the musical party through Australasia, has
surprised his friends by remaining alive, and
is now well. After a smashing in the war
he developed spinal trouble that was regarded
as the finish, and lie spent a long time
in Waterfall Sanatorium; but his cheerful-
ness and energy were never-ending. He was
appointed in charge of the elocution depart-
ment started at the Melbourne Albert-street
Conservatorium ; but a lot of friends feared
he would not hold it long. Now an opera-
tion to the spinal column has worked
wonders.
Little Mrs. Percy Hunter, vivid and gay
up to the moment the operating-theatre closed
upon her, has slipped into the long peace
after weeks of pain, only kept in check by the
merciful hypodermic. Before her marriage to
Percy, then a Herald reporter, now one of
the heads of the Pacific Cable, Mrs. Hunter
was Lily Blair, daughter of journalist
David Blair, of Melbourne. Her sister Flo-
rence, afterwards Mrs. Baverstock, was for
a time writer of this Letter. Mrs.
Hunter’s husband and two sons, one a bar-
rister and the other a solicitor, whose devo-
tion to their sick mother was the pride of
Ivirribilli, where the family lias lived for the
last two or three years, are very lonely
because of her passing.
Pretty little Cal. Service became Mrs.
Darrell Levy within the walls of her own
home on Bellevue Hill one night last week.
This little couple whispered their vows
amidst boughs of blossoming peach, and the
bride, above her ethereal pinks and silvers,
struck a Spanish note by wearing a fan of
orange blossom in her hair. Groom’s sister
Una made a fragrant maid in mingled mauve
moires and tall stocks. The bride’s mother
carried red roses against a black wedding
garment during the subsequent congratu-
lations.
In old Marylebone Parish Church Maie
Mason, daughter of organist Arthur Mason,
formerly of Sydney, was wed in August,
with Dad to give her away, to Robert
Stevens, of the Inner Temple, London. Their
home will be at Tangiers.
It was a kindly thought of pianist Beryl
Averting to give her recital in the King’s
Hall last week in aid of the Darlington
Institute for the Deaf and Dumb and Blind.
With a fine interpretation of a programme
which included Schumann’s Concerto in A
minor, Beethoven’s Thirty-two Variations and
Bach’s Prelude and Fugue in B flat, Miss
Averting proved herself fit to take her place
among the most promising of Sydney
musicians. In the Schumann Concerto the
second piano was played by Winifred Brad-
ford, who also supplied the accompaniments
for basso Wilfrid Thomas.
The littlest one of the family loves to
do exactly what small big brother and sister
are doing. The other day the two older
kiddies were indulging in loud and fervent
hymn-singing. Thrice had the littlest one
been checked by big brother for replacing
the hymn-maker’s words by some of his own.
Suddenly in “Onward, Christian Soldiers,’’
big sister stopped and with disgust in her
tone demanded: “Bunty, why don’t you
sing ‘Leads against the foe,’ instead of
saying ‘Leans against the Phone!’ Why
would God be leaning against the Phone?”
The small boy flung around in self-defence.
“To get liitli number, of courtli!” he snapped.
Ho’ward Ashton, of the Sun, has a
mother-in-law of whom he is proud; Mrs.
Roberts, at 86, is still an accomplished
pianist, and until quite lately was a com-
poser, too. The old lady was born in George-
street in 1841, and remembers when there
was bush on Brickfield Hill; and she
paddled in the Tank Stream. After her
marriage she lived for 32 years in Queens-
land, where the Roberts family has handled
the Maryborough Chronicle for three
generations.

in the Phoenix „
at 7 in the morning
DURING the eighteenth century duelling played a
prominent part in the career of a gentleman, and in
Ireland was conducted with characteristic enthusiasm.
In Phoenix Park, a favourite rendezvous for affairs of
honor, meetings were of frequent occurrence. Though
duelling has baen superseded by more
peaceful methods, one link with duel-
ling, days remains. John Jameson
Whiskey is exactly the same to-day as
in 1780, when it was first distilled.
After one hundred and fifty years m
purity and essential character remain
unchanged. Its excellence made it
pre-eminent in the Georgian era. Its
excellence makes it pre-eminent to-
day. Always ask for “J.J.”

The Barrett-a’Beckett wedding was the
social thrill of a very dull week. Tlie nice-
looking young bride was Joyce, the elder
daughter of the W. a’Beckett couple of The
Grange, Berwick. She rides to hounds with
the Melbourne Hunt Club and the Findon
Harriers. The bridegroom is the younger
son of maltster William Barrett. His parents
and sisters are at present touring in Europe.
The bells of St. John’s, Toorak, were pealed
with vim, and inside there were heaps of
pink and white blossoms. The short wed-
ding robe beneath a wealth of white tulle
and delicate lace glistened with crystal and
silver and diffused a faint pink glow. A
true-lover’s knot in blue figured on the train,
and a shower bouquet of pink and wliijfe
flowers added a further touch of color. Tlie
bride’s sister Joan and her pal Joan New-
bigin attended her in pink frocks all frills
and corrugated panels, with large crinoline
hats of the same hue. At No. 9 afterwards
there was a great gathering of hunt fol-
lowers.
Women golfers, who flocked here from all
parts for tlie Australian championship meet-
ing last week, were entertained at No. 9
the other evening, when there were bridge
and other divertissements. Among the hos-
tesses were Mrs. J. H. Byrne, with a gleam
of silver on a mulberry-hued gown ; Dorothy
Mollison, a symphony in blue and silver,
and Nan Guthrie, with crystal sparkling on
an orange-toned frock. Mrs. D. C. Cudmore
tS.A.) wore black lace; Mrs. Reid (Tas.)
sported a gown like the heavens on a starry
night; Airs. Darvall Barton, of Sydney,
chose pink and silver. Airs. Lance Lewis
(S.A.) combined an elaborate Chinese wrap
with a gleaming sheath gown of golden
sequins. Priminister Bruce’s wife, in a gown
of iris-mauve tone, was one of the guests,
A couple of Yankee medicoes, Charles Elliot
and Dr. A. Kanavel, who are here to lecture,
were given a welcome by the League.
Airs. Fred Bird, robed in black with a gleam
of silver, handed specimens of Australian
flora to the wives of the visitors, and the
secretary, Mrs. Arthur Hordern, in scintil-
lating black, said words of greeting. Dr.
Stan Argyle and Consul Garrels said things,
too. Airs. R. R. Stawell, in a silver gown,
and Airs. Dunbar Hooper, in black decorated
with beads and sequins, helped as hostesses.
Airs. Elliot’s magpie array was enlivened
with rhinestones and emerald crystal beads,
worn with an amber-hued shawl; and
Mrs. Kanavel wore a mushroom-pink coat
over a georgette frock of the same color.
Cherry-blossoms and purple stocks decked
the reception-room. Professor Spencer’s lady,
the Fay AlcClures, the Harold Brookes
couple, Airs. Argyle and a whole raft of
doctors and their wives were there.
The Minton Boys’ Home, which clothes
and feeds some of the ragged orphan boys
of this city, benefited by a ball at St. Kilda
Town Hall on Friday night. There was a
dash of the Oriental in the decorative scheme
of crimson and gold. Mrs. James Menzies,
wife of the president of the committee, wore
a gown of glistening black. Mrs. J. F. Mac-
keddie also favored black with rhinestone
embellishment. Commander and Airs. Cres-
well and their daughter Jan, W. C. Gilbert,
principal of the Minton Home, and Mrs.
Gilbert, were among the dancers. Dr. Mar-
jorie Hughes wrnre blue georgette ; Alayoress
Burnett, of St. Kilda, chose oxidised gold
lace and tulle covering; Cora Spowers was
a nice-looking maiden whose red frock
blended into gold embroidery; and Nancy
Stokes was clad in buttercup tones.
Rose Paterson started another big drive
on behalf of the Civil Ambulance on Thurs-
day night with a jazz-cwm-bridge party at
her domicile, Ardoch flats, East St. Kilda.
Alayoress Alorell. in clouds of grey chiffon
with a surmounting of silver lame and fox
fur, and daughter Sheila, in white georgette,
were bridge-players. Rose Paterson played
the hostess in black with filmy pink lace, and
Mrs. Arthur Paterson, a sparkle of del-
phinium-blue and crystal, led a bevy of fair
sweet-vendors. Airs. E. Al. Pearce, swathed
in black chiffon velvet. Airs. Jack Kelly and
some others helped with the management.
Beppie de Vries and her husband, J. F.
Lebret. took tea with Austral Salonites on
a recent afternoon. Her sable-collared coat
covered a black georgette and lace frock, over
pink, allied to a black felt hat. Peg Des-
mond, a fellow-mummer, was entertained
too, wearing japonica red with beige lace
and black millinery. Among those who
rallied round to welcome the guests was Yera
Spaull, in a jumper suit of lime-green and
black kasha with gold embroidery. Mrs. 0.
Leighton, in ecru lace and georgette of
burnt-bread hue, with black satin millinery,
was hostess, aided by her sister, Mrs. H. *T.
Nairn. Walter Kirby and others dispensed
musical farh.
Beppie de Vries launched Margaret Mac-
Lean’s new studio and art salon one after-
noon last week. A black hat, lined with
pink, enhanced the fresh complexion and blue
eyes of the actress, and her fur coat covered
a black lace gown. Miss Mac Lean, in
spring green frock and wide-brimmed hat,
handed the Dutch lady a pink-and-blue posy.
The new gallery is a bright front room,
quite large enough for one-man shows, with
mantelpieces and chairs lacquered in red and
hangings of cretonne in dark blues and
browns. On the opening day there were
on show pictures by Arthur Streeton, Bla-
mire Young, Tom Roberts and others, with
pottery and some tine examples of the inlaid
woodwork of Elma Roach. Neville fiowse's
lady, Mrs. Victor Wischcr, the E. M. Pearce

Secretary Miss Bale and some fellow-artists
put on the kettle. Madame Rene Turck, in
a tailor-made suit of putty color topped by
beret cap of the same shade, the Maudsley,
Spencer and Morell ladies, Mrs. R. M. Clarke
and Mrs. F. G. Cresswell were in the throng.
Vera Bedford had a 'cold, showery night
for her recital of original compositions and
operatic excerpts, and the audience wasn’t as
big as it might otherwise have been. The
clever artist, a commanding figure in caped
gown of peach-pink georgette and a brow-
band of leaves, scored a big success, and was
rewarded with sheaves of daffodils, dahlias
and pansies. Soprano Maisie Ramsey, Raie
Levy, the British Music Society’s string
quartette, baritone Alexander Raff and
Harold Elvins, who was accompanist, also
figured on the programme.
The cafe chantant and bridge-party organ-
ised: by Mrs. Merson Cooper at Menzies’
a few weeks ago for the purchase of crockery
for St. Vincent’s Hospital brought in £440,
which makes a new record for afternoon
affairs of the kind.
The Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers, after a spell of
home life, is considering a tour through
Canada with Seymour Ilickk’s company.
When Hicks was in Australia he stage-
managed an amateur production in which the
Governor-General’s daughter played a part,
and so lost his temper at rehearsal that he
chid her with a good-sized “damn,” which
the lady received coldly, and they parted at
freezing-point. But evidently bygones are
to be bygones.
Spencer Shier made this picture of Mrs.
jrifneas Gunn, whose novels, “The Little
Black Princess” and “We of the Never
Never,” have
attained wide-
spread fame.
In a plebiscite
conducted by
the Argus
lately to

AVomen journalists and members of the
Lyceum Club plan to give the talented lady
a complimentary dinner one night this week.
After giving lectures in Chicago in con-
nection with the Foundation, Pro-
fessor Harrison Moore and his clever lady
stayed at the Chateau Frontenac, Quebec,
for a few days. The Australian’s fame as
an expositor of abstruse points of law has
spread to Canada, and Senator Dandurand,
Speaker of the Senate, Sir Eomer Gouin
and other legislators were callers.
Mrs. Claud Hamilton’s wrestle with ill-
health is hastening the home-coming of
daughter Slielah, who, before she became
Mrs. Bruce Boswell and went to live on an
Assam tea-plantation, was one of the pret-
tiest members of our younger set. She
will be welcomed back with eclat and tea
and things.
Effie Varley, daughter of the Frank Varley
couple of East Malvern, after a short fur-
lough with her people, has returned to
Nigeria and her mission work.
Mrs. Connolly, accompanied by Iris and
Freda, has taken train to Sydney, where for
the next two months they propose to bask in
the sunshine. Iris has an altar date with
Julian Smith at the end of the year.
Frank Russell is hard at work on a new
Australian drama which is being \vritten to
suit Betty Ross Clarke, with whose husband,
Greville Collins, Frank has become associ-
ated in a theatrical venture. The first
production will be at Perth, following on
the heels of the “Sentimental Bloke.”
Denise Russell, a 16-year-old Geelong giri
who is at school in France, has been making

the singles.
Joyce Maund, who lived for years at
Hawthorn, where her dad was vicar of St.
Martin’s, had a marriage date on September

which her father is now incumbent.
The C. H. Chomleys’ daughter Francis
was married on August 18 in London to
C. R. Knight, of Hobart. Their home will
be set up at Bantry, in the Ould Sod, where
his job is located.
From beneath the smart hat looks Mrs. F.
Krcrouse. Australian theatre-goers of not so
very long ago remember lief as a star in
musical comedy, but now she’s the wife of a
well- known
lawyer. The
stage is as
noted for its
kind hearts as
for the coro-
nets that some-
times fall in
the way of its
a t tractive
girls, and Mrs.
Krcrouse is an
able and stren-
uous worker
tor charitable
i n s t i tutions.
St. Martin’s
Boys’ Home,
which she
took under
her wing from
the time it
started, Mel-
bourne Hospi-
tal and the Children’s Hospital are only
a few of her interests. Her aptitude as
an organiser has been exercised on behalf
of these and many other institutions. The
picture is by Spencer Shier.
Freda Allison, who lives with her mother
at Sandringham, has engaged herself to Tom
Carmichael, of Larnoo, Yea, son of the late
J. B. Carmichael and Mrs. J. Mitchell, of
Castcrton.
A passenger by the Orama was Dr.
Beryl Bowman of the staff of Queen
Victoria Hospital, who has been gaining
medical experience abroad. She is the first
woman doctor in Victoria to obtain the
Diploma of Trinity College, Dublin, in gynae-
cology and obstretrics, and also put up a
record as the first candidate to gain full
marks. Dr. Bowman, who is a daughter
of the A. N. Bowmans, of Surry Hills. Mel-
bourne, is an ex-student of the P.L.C. and
went through her medical course at the local
shop.
The Maloja has taken William Mcßeath
and his lady to England, where their
daughter Connie is the guest of her sister,
the wife of Dr. Williams. The family re-
union is likely to be continued by all re-
turning here early next year.
_ There is much rejoicing among supporters
of women’s movements at the appointment
of Edith Onians as a special magistrate of
the Children’s Court at North Melbourne.
She is the first woman in Victoria to be per-
mitted to sit on the bench.
Kenneth Impett is a young Melbourne
baritone whose fame has been hidden too
long under a bushel. It is hoped on Saturday
to fill the measure with gold by means of a
valedictory concert at the Assembly Hall,
so that the may go to Italy. Almost
everybody worth mentioning will assist to
pass the evening.
Captain Radcliff, who hails from Geelong,
is fitting nicely into his job with the Royal
Automobile Club in London, where, as the
club’s secretary, he comes into contact with
many Australians and gives them wise
counsel over proposed motor tours. His
first love was the law, and then lie went
abroad to study music. He got into kaliki
when the guns began to roar and wound up
with a commission.
Alexander McKenzie, Ballarat’s new Mayor,
being a widower with no daughter of the
hostess age, has persuaded his niece, Miss
McKenzie, to help him dispense civic coffee
and conversation.
The praise given by tourists to our parks
and gardens has reached the ears of the
director of Kew Gardens, Dr. A. W. Hill,
who is coming to see for himself.
Robert Lascelles, the partner of dainty
Thurza Rogers, has added a dancing academy
to the shoals we already possess, and will
teach the methods of the Russian ballet.
Thurza Rogers, the little Maoriland dancer
who made her Australian debut in Pavlova’s
company and is now a leading lady of musi-
cal comedy, has been bidden to open a
flower show at the Hawthorn Town Hall.
Her progress towards fame is rapid.
Attractive sports attire was shown at one
of last week’s mannequin parades. One
jumper suit of white crepe de Chine had
a skirt banded in red, green, jade and black.
Above the hem of the jumper was worked u
frieze of red-roofed cottages and tall pop-
lars. The new evening wraps were also
shown. They are big squares, like a glori-
fied tablecloth, elaborately embroidered and
bordered with a contrasting hem. The new-
est filmy silk scarves have a central slit for
the fair wearer’s head to pop through. An-
other conceit of the moment is the smoking
ne,<)li<je, which is fashioned on the lines of
pierrot attire. One of pale rose-pink satin
with cobwebby lace about the ankles and
wrists was much admired. A long black
satin coat on the mode of a bath-robe went
over all. For street wear navy blue in com-
bination with mushroom-pink figured pro-
minently, and mushroom-pink and black,
with rhinestone embellishment, seems to be
the favorite color scheme for up-to-date even-
ing wear.
Buckley and Nunn recently sent out
invitations for a private view of spring
pretties. Exquisite wraps and painted
scarves and some particularly natty sports
suits attracted a good deal of attention. The
coloring of some of the new frocks is very
vivid—blues that would astonish even Lewis
and Wliitty, and cherry-reds and crimsons
that positively glow. Most of the millinery
was a dash of azure, and it looks as if spring
will be a season of blues.
The electrical show at the Exhibition
contains two “model bungalows.” Feminine
eyes rest longingly upon the kitchens of
these homes with their prettily-colored walls
—one of primrose tint, with lengthy dressers
of harmonising tone, and china to match.
A little windowed recess just large enough
for cretonne upholstered seats and a table
set for a meal attracts the housewifely
glance, too. The kiddies find their chief
delight in an elaborate model farm. There
is a miniature homestead whose tiny fur-
nishings include washing machine, telephone
and a cabinet radio which really works.
j-he death of Mrs. Isabella Travers, at
Toorak, brings to mind a yarn about
her father, Thomas a’Beckett, who was for
many years a justice of the Supreme Court.
’Sonah had sentenced to death a man who
had been tried before him and found guilty
by the dozen in the box. As usual the
Cabinet considered the sentence, and
a’Beckett, as is the custom in Vic., was sum-
moned to attend and give Ministers any
information they desired. “What sort of a
man is he?” drawled Premier Murray in that
nice, persuasive style he could employ when
he liked. The Judge smiled, and replied:
“Oh, as to' his looks and bearing they were
unimpeachable; in fact, he was remarkably
like my learned brother ” and lie men-
tioned the name of a most upright Judge.
The Cabinet joined in the smile, and decided
to make it a long term of imprisonment
instead of the rope. .:•«
Roy Shepherd, who, as the 1925 Clarke
Scholarship winner, is studying the pianoforte
at Fogtown’s R.C.M., was recently soloist-
in Tschaikowsky’s Concerto in B flat minor
under the baton of Dr. Adrian C. Boult.
The fair-haired youth’s performance won
warm professorial approval.
“A.G.M.’s” notes from London
The Hon. Mrs. Robert Lindsay, better remembered
in Melbourne and Sydney as Mary Clarke, of Clive-
den, has taken a house in Charles-street, off Berkeley-
square, where she has many fashionable neighbors,
including your recent visitor Mrs. Greville. On
June 27, by way of a house warming, Mrs. Lindsay
gave a dance for her two girls Joyce and Rosemary,
the younger of whom has inherited much of her
mother’s good looks. The hostess wore enough dia-
monds to convince her distinguished guests that the
fortunes of the Clarkes were no idle dream.
The new Lady Abinger was a Miss MacPhillamy,
of New South Wales. The eldest son and heir was
born in 1914. Very few people in England knew
that the late peer had married the widow of M.
Steinheil, the French artist whose tragic death
brought her so i"""h undesirable publicity.
Princess Mary and her family have returned to
town, but so far the Court Circular has contained no
announcement of any function, private or otherwise,
at which H.R.H. and the Duke and Duchess of York
have met. It is generally conceded that the publicity
officers attached to the Court have been giving too
much limelight to the Yorks while Princess Mary,
who works as hard as any Royalty, has been to some
extent denied the measure due to her. She might
one day be the reigning Queen of England, but the
Duchess of York could never step higher than Queen
Consort. The King and Queen are doing their par t
to right the little family squabble, and Princess Mary
is now their announced companion for several big
coming events.

Wars and rumors of wars have made this
“black” State very quiet socially. Work-
girls look terribly fagged, for so many have
to walk many a weary mile to get into town,
and everybody, almost, has some cross to
bear, so it was not surprising that no
single cheer marked the march of the A.R.U.
to the park. Indeed something suspiciously
like groans followed the prosperous-looking
crowd of young men.
In the Trocadero the 49th Battalion had
a ball to which the Goodwins came. After
the vice-regal arrival the regimental colors
were brought into the ballroom by Color-
officer Lieut. Hulme. Lieut.-Colonel and
Mrs. G. PI. J. Smith, Major and Mrs. Craven
and Captain Sutcli welcomed their Exes.,
and Lady Goodwin received a bouquet of
sweet-peas and violets. She wore mist-grey
mariette with an ivory ’broidered shawl.
News comes from England that Sir Mat-
thew Nathan has suggested that scientists
coming to investigate the wonders of the
Barrier Reef should have the assistance of
Australian investigators, and that there should
be a permanent marine biological station in
the South-west Pacific. Dr. Younge’s wife
will be the first English girl to live on the
reef. She holds a medical degree and is a
smart dresser. There will not be much
chance of showing her pretty frocks off on
the reef! A story is told of the abos. up
there possessing one pair of blucher boots,
which is lent to the bride, no matter what
the size of her feet, when a marriage is per-
formed by a missionary.
The St. John’s Cathedral fete was held at
Bisliopsbourne in beautiful weather. Lady
Goodwin started the ball rolling in mauve
and grey crepe de Chine, with black picture
hat, and was presented with violets and roses
by Helen Le Fanu. Colonel Campbell’s wife
wore biscuit color. Archgaiters Sharp and
Dean de Witt Batty received.
The Wild Flower Show revealed many
beautiful specimens from Stradbroke and
Tambourine Mountain and flower-spots round
Moreton Bay. Mayor Jolly opened the
exhibition in the Albert Hall, and there were
some fine photographs of flora and fauna.
Brisbane has decided to have its Aus-
tralian Authors’ Week in October, largely
supplemented by Australian pictures and pot-
tery, so the Australian author evidently isn’t
considered strong enough to stand on his or
her own feet in Queensland, though quite a
number of notable books, including the verses
of Brunton Stephens and Essex Evans, were
printed in Brisbane. It is suggested that a
special display of Queensland writers’ work,
as well as of Queensland printing, should bo
given. The Lyceum Club is proffering an
evening in aid of its authors’ branch. Pro-
fessor Stable is in the chair of the Authors’
Week committee.
A golden wedding of the last week was that
of the W. H. Guys, of Burderim. He was
born in London in ’4l, and served under Gari-
baldi in Italy. He came to Queensland when
he was 22 to take a place in surveyor Tager’s
camp, and in ’7l he selected on Buderim.
Born in Edinburgh, his wife was only a
baby when she came to Australia. They
were married at Carlossie station on the
Burnett, a property of the bride’s father,
Robert Hamilton, in ’77. The honeymoon
was a ride of 300 miles across country to
Buderim, done in 10 days.
Another golden wedding was celebrated at
Warwick by the W. G. Skermans. He was
one of the passengers from England wrecked
in Bass Strait in the Netherby. Mrs. Sker-
man was borrn at Banff, ye ken, and came
with her people to Queensland in the good
ship Queen of the Colonies in ’66. The
couple were married at North Pine in ’77.
A son was killed in France. Six sons and
four daughters are living, and there are
51 grandchildren.

Hobart.
His Ex. and Margaret O’Grady were
guests at the annual ball given by the
matron to the nurses of the General Hos-
pital at the Continental. Nurses let loose
are jolly folk, and the hop was a happy one.
The frocking was particularly pretty.
Premier Lyons and his wife and family
have quitted Hobart to take up quarters at
Devonport.
Mrs. Darling, whose face looks out from
this page, was the first secretary of the Bush
Nursing State council, and has seen her pet
chicken grow
into a big hen,
with chicks of
its own in
many a rural
centre even
at Adamsfield,
the mushroom
township o f
the osmiridium
field. When
the Govern-
ment took
over the move-
me n t Mrs.
Darling turned
her attention
to hockey, and
has taken a
chief part in
working up the
association and
getting the
State schools
to adopt the
game. Entertaining the sailors from visit-
ing warships has been another of this active
lady’s hobbies, and many a lonely Jack has
made friends and spent pleasant evenings in
port as the result of her efforts.
Jean Johnston and Molly Eady, two bright
members of the younger set, were joint
secs, for a dance at the Imperial. Margaret
O’Grady was present in a very effective red-
beaded frock. Committee-people carried as
their distinguishing badges little red devils
with long legs, and a few bold spirits essayed
the Blackbottom. Now who dare say that
Hobart is slow?
The bridge party at the Lyceum Club,
organised by three doctors’ wives, Mrs. Wil-
frid Giblin, Mrs. C. N. Atkins and Mrs. H.
Armstrong, in aid of the Cascades Hospital,
was one of the smartest affairs of the sea-
son. The space in the large room at the
club was taxed to its utmost. Flowers made
a gay effect, but the prettiest decoration was
a bevy of girls in multicolored frocks whose
tables were set -on the platform. The amount
raised considerably exceeded expectations.
Wattle Day brought in £l5O more this year
than it did last. But then the weather was
much filler. Stalls in the streets did good
business, and there was the usual tree-
planting ceremony for the school kiddies in
the Domain.
Pauline, Princess Melikoff, one of our
Hobart beauties, lias just gone through the
wedding ceremony with Prince Melikoff for
the second time. The encore was at the
Russian Cathedral at Nice, according to the
rites of the Greek Church. A photograph
shows her on the steps of the cathedral sur-
rounded by princes, for, besides her husband,
his father, Prince Peter, and his brother,
Prince Levan Melikoff, were present.

Mr. and Mrs. W. A. G. Walter, well
known in this State, where he has been
magistrate in many districts, have decided
to make their home in Burmali, and left,
after a round of farewell parties, by the
Gascoyne. Quite a crowd went to Fremantle
to wave them farewell.

Adelaide.
At the moment our social life moves chiefly
on rails laid by the Victoria League. There
is a conference afoot that has brought dele-
gates from the sister States and even from
Northern Australia. The Federal Attorney-
General and others came from Melbourne to
address it; and there has been business in
the mornings and sometimes in the evenings,
with parties for the other evenings and the
afternoons.
A general muster of members at the
Masonic Hall set the ball rolling. There
Miss Murray did* the honors, and guests
included the Governor, Lady Bridges, in bois-
de-rose and stone-marten furs, and the
Wallace Bruces. There were speeches from
the Governor and the Masson lady, and
flowers galore. Tea was served downstairs
by members of the league’s latest departure,
a corps of the younger set pledged to lend a
hand with any league activities, and mar-
shalled under the wing of Mrs. Kenneth
Milne and Mrs. Lavington Bonython.
At Birksgate Mrs. Barr Smith hostessed
a party for the Leaguers in a garden all
aglow with spring on a heaven-sent after-
noon. Her daughter, Mrs. J. H. Gosse, gave
a party too; or, rather, gave it by proxy,
for an untimely germ laid her low and her
sisters did the honors for her. Mrs. Culross
and Mrs. Lavington Bonython bade members
to tea at Mount Lofty, and there was one
of the always-popular Settlers’ Welcome teas
at the Botanic Park.
Also we are having Synod, and a National
Council pf Women Conference threatens next
week. One of the delegates to that, Dr.
Georgina Sweet, has already arrived, and has
been tea-ed by the Y.M.C.A. (her visit is
partly to them, for she is acting national
president) and by Mayoress Bruce at the
Town Hall.
For interludes there have been races at
Morphettville, on a vile day, a “modern com-
poser” concert by the S.A. Orchestra and a
weddding. Valerie, daughter of the F. V.
Saundersons, married Cecil, son of the
Ernest Davenports, a clan that holds proud
records among our pioneers.
Back from England is Marjorie Bonnin,
having won her teaching certificate in Dal-
croze eurhythmies and proved her prowess
by passing her examinations brilliantly. On
their way are Ariel Shearer, who has been
studying the piano in London, and Constance
Grivell, whose mezzo-soprano has done all
that it promised. Both are to give concerts.

Women sometimes worse,

... .V.A.: Unattractive.... Grace F.: Altogether too
slight. . . .V.C.W.: The resurrection telegraphed itself.

directness and force; the screed under notice is
too involved. Sometimes it loses its meaning in
words. .. .Felix: Given to the cat.... Marcus D,:
P00r... .Philo: Both are worth revising. But you
can’t “toss a cry into our eyes”... .R.T.K.: Sounds
all right, but the exact meaning of the last lines

Laudable attempt to make a song about the daisy

two lines slump.. . .H.E.C.: Still don’t care for it
much.'.. .S.S.V.: Dou’t see why we should.... Lime-
stone Siding: But that isn’t much of a haul. The
other day a load of Nappamerrie wool came into
Broken Hill after a road journey of 110 miles —
and not a mile of it made road either. .. .W.M.F.:
Thanks. .. .Sohral: Some of it might have been usable

stroke. .. .H.E.C.: Painfully immature... .E.T.:
Neither joke nor drawing appealed... .E.S.: Left

makes for poor reproductions. . . . Y.A. : Very much on
the wrong side. .. .A.M.D.: Humor and drawing too
juvenile... ,V.M.: Uninteresting sofa-spooners.
THE INKY WAY.
“P.X.” : It was an interesting coincidence
that happened on the "Smoke-oh” page of
last Bulletin. Three artists had drawings
there —Bay Lindsay, the second son of Nor-
man (Jack, the eldest, is in London) ;
Mahdi McCrae, daughter of Hugh; and
Vicol, who is the young wife and pupil of
a former well-known Bulletin draughtsman.
So son, daughter and wife of three well-
known artists came together on the page.
“Caption”: I once wrote a pome that
brought me reject slips from editors in three
capitals. A lit’ry agent in London then
threatened to dispose or it, but after five
attempts he gave up the struggle. So I re-
typed my dog-eared darling and sent her to
an editor who had already ■denied her. He
not only reversed his decision, but called in
his pen-and-ink man to illustrate her
beauties.
“W.R.8.”: The finest of all tributes to
“Hop” was paid years ago by an irou-
worker at Sliepparton (Vic.). A scribe
from Sydney was visiting the town, and
Joe Furphy (“Tom Collins,” author of
“Such Is Life”) introduced him to the
boys at the local foundry. “Hop’s” name
came up. “‘Hop’?” said one of the toilers.
“Why, if that bloke only drew a straight
line there’d be humor in it!”
“Spare Sub”: Reading between the lines
is never so intriguing as when applied to
journalistic contents bills. The other day a
weekly which recently made its appearance
without exactly setting the city in a blaze
had this to say of itself: —
PUSHFULL’S PARCEL.
The Numbing Hand of Death.
Regarded in any light, the announcement has
its sinister aspects.
“Skrip” : Now that the Goulburn Herald
has gone the Braidwood Dispatch must be
the oldest country sheet in southern N. S.
Wales. One C. Watson issued the first Dis-
patch 72 years ago. He had trouble in get-
ting supplies of paper, ink and accessories,
and was sometimes obliged to print on brown
paper bought (or borrowed) from the store-
keeper. When wrapping paper gave out, as
it did occasionally, Watson resorted to
calico. It is even recorded that the indomit-
able man gathered up his “rags,” washed
them and used them for succeeding issues.
“C.S.G.”: The S. M. Herald sub. respon-
sible for the headline “Butchery in a Bakery”
(B. l/9/’27) was Harry Gullett, now
M.H.R. for Henty (Vic.). He admitted the
soft impeachment on a troopship—he was
sergeant-major to a quota of artillery re-
inforcements, incidentally editing the ship-
board magazine. I haven’t seen Gullett
since, but I shall always, remember how he
spent most of his first night on Salisbury
Plain. We arrived at midnight in a snow-
storm. Gullett rushed all over the camp
borrowing and commandeering blankets and
bedding for the half-frozen troops, and see-
ing that everyone in his charge was warm
and fed before he thought of himself.
“Wongajong”: Freelances in Australia
have for years been handicapped by the ab-
sence of a handbook on the lines of Black’s
“Writers and Artists’ Year Book” which
would tell them the requirements, rates of
pay, etc., of the two or three hundred papers
accepting copy from outsiders. Two Sydney
men, William Fitz Henry and Cecil Ring-
stad, have set out to supply this deficiency,
and are preparing for publication in January
the first edition of “The Australian and N.Z.
Writers and Artists’ Year Book.” Besides
giving information as to the wants of about
250 Australasian editors, it is to contain a
number of special articles of interest to the
outside contributor. It is to cost half a
crown.
“Rob P.”: One interview satisfied pro-
fessional cadgers that John Norton ivas a
tough and impolite prospect, but genuine
cases found him easier. A taxi-man who had
got into a moneylender’s clutches and lost his
car and furniture was advised to see Norton.
On entering the sanctum he w T as greeted
with, “What the d 'you want?”
John heard his story, however, wrote a
cheque and pushed it into his hand, bel-
lowing, “Now, get out!” The cheque was
for £l5O. Months later the taxi-man came
in, slightly sober, to liquidate some of the
debt. “Did I ask you for the money?” John
yelled. “Get to blazes out of this.” I doubt
if he left any written record of where that
£l5O went.
“Tethys”: The death of Mrs. Percy
Hunter stirs memories of the days when she
and her sister (Mrs. Baverstock now) col-
laborated with the brightest wits on the
Melbourne press in the production of
Bohemia. Donald Macdonell, John Sandes
and Davison (“Peter”) Symmons corus-
cated in Bohemia for a few months, and the
Blair sisters helped to give it feminine tone
and provide the correct atmosphere. Then
general-manager Mackinnon of the Argus
stood Donald. “Peter” and Johnnie on the
mat and reminded them that the office had
its own weekly, the Australasian. The
trio graciously accepted a 50 per cent, rise
and agreed to drop Bohemia and start
“Oriel” in. Saturday’s Argus. This scribe
obliged Bohemia with financial articles, for
which he was not paid. In point of fact,
he had to take the staff out to luncheon at
Matoorekos’s oyster parlor to get his “copy”
inserted.
For the past 10 days The Bulletin Ser-
vice Department has been snowed under
with readers’ applications for the free prints
of “Hop’s” great drawings, “I Thought I Had
a Stamp,” “The Flowing Bowl” and “The
Roll Call.” The first named is the favorite,
but the other two are not far behind. It
is interesting to note that there is still a
good sprinkling of old Soudan veterans,
many who state that they have read The
Bulletin since those days, and who, of
course, ask for “The Roll Call.” The fact
that many secretaries of clubs and schools
of art have written for copies suggests that
“Hop’s” work will be kept familiar for many
years in many public places. Another fea-
ture that indicates the wide appeal of the
great cartoonist is that a fireman, a Consul-
General, a complete Full Court of Judges
and a rabbit-trapper have sent in their
coupons along with boundary-riders, a sea
captain and at least one Federal Minister.

u
but pride of possession prompts me to write” is a remark often
' to be found in letters from enthusiastic B.S.A. riders.
Every B.S.A. owner knows the meaning of “pride of possession.” He owns
a machine he is proud to show his friends. If he is a sporting rider he can
boast about the m.p.h. his O.H.V. model can do —and he is proud of its
sporting appearance and clean lines. The man with the lightweight talks
about its ease of control and extreme simplicity, while the rider of a heavy
touring mount glories in its wonderful power and flexibility. And one and
all, they boast about the economical upkeep of their mounts and their
wonderful reliability and ability to cover all kinds of “rough stuff” without
damage to frame or engine parts.
Follow the lead of thousands of enthusiastic B.S.A. riders and feel for
yourself that “pride of possession” in a mount which will answer every call
you make upon it. There are 14 models to choose from, in six engine
capacities, including two O.H.V. models.

The Sydney Society of Artists’ mixed lot:
Rather naively the Society of .Artists, announcing
the conditions of its show, proclaimed that exhibitors
would be limited to six pictures, and that each
member of the society would be entitled to submit
one picture without judgment. A lot of members
have shown appreciation by submitting pictures
entirely without judgment. The result is a curiously
mixed exhibition. It is not often that you find
comic relief in an art show; but you get it here.
The most curious of the freaks is by H. Cossing-
ham Smith, whose picture of “Trees” is evidently
intended to suggest how trees might have looked if
a demented Creator had wrought them; and the
“Hot Night” of Aletta Lewis belongs to the same
species. Apparently the inhabitants of a Home for
the Misshapen have discarded clothes and made their
way to a roof. Artistically Roy de Mestre enjoys
himself in much the same way. Though Kenneth Mac-
queen’s style is queer, too, there is some visible pur-
pose in his work, and the result is almost a relief.
There are others who do not attempt such an enter-
taining disguise of their inability to paint things
as the eye of common man sees them. Thus Mildred
Lovett’s “Tasmanian Landscape” may be sincere, yet
it might pay the Government to buy it, lest it do
damage to the tourist trade.
Apart from the freaks, the exhibition has some real
excellencies. The Professor Mackie of George Lam-
bert and his W. M. Hughes are both lively works;
in the latter, a commission for the Commonwealth,
you can feel that Billy is about to jump to his feet
and waggle one of those long spidery fingers at some-
body. Will Ashton has a good group; two sea
pieces, with very real water curling at the base of
boldly-drawn cliffs, “The Headland” and “Dobroyde
Headland,” hold most appeal. There are a few
Elioth Gruner pictures, too, one flower study (valued
at 125 guineas) and a Cooma landscape being par-
ticularly attractive; and a greatly improved J. Muir
Auld shows some likeable work in several land-
scapes into which he gets romance, and a large
portrait study, “The Silver Scarf.” A sense of
massiveness is in Norman Carter’s “Demolition”;
but in “Surfers” one of the lounging youths looks
as if he might be 10ft. high or thereabouts.
The big picture of the show, of Ark-
aba,” is supplied by Hans Heysen; it is full of
light and distance. George Bell is best represented
by “Youth and Age.” Julian Ashton has “The White
Sail,” quite a minor affair, but pleasant and breezy ;
Robert Johnson a fresh “Eastwood Landscape” and
another; Percy Lindsay a delightful “Robard’s
Creek” ; and John Rowell, Fred Leist, 11. R. Gallop
and E. J. de Lough (“The Waihou River, N.Z.,” is
attractive) are moderately represented. Bernard
Hall has two good portraits, one of Jessica Harcourt,
the other of Robert Garran ; his atmospheric “In the
Studio” reappears, and a lady who is about to take
a bath is painted large size with a sponge. John
Moore, whose “Moving Pictures,” a beach scene, has
some points, puts himself into the Chamber of
Horrors with “Spring Fever,” in which an ill-drawn
untidy girl in a salmon blouse is standing in a
nightmare landscape; and Margaret Preston shows
occasional gleams of art reason in her queer work.
B. E. Minns has a batch of sunlit pictures amongst
the water-colors; Joseph Connor, Daryl Lindsay and
Albert Collins have things they needn’t be ashamed
of ; but Sydney Ure Smith does not succeed well with
his four, although he is well represented in the black-
and-white section, which is weaker than usual. Ray-
nor Hoff has a large relief in plaster, “Stampede of
the Lower Gods,” in which terror is well depicted
upon the fleeing deities; there are several smaller
contributions and a plaster “Boy’s Head” by Arthur
J. Murch; and, in the Industrial section, Rhoda
Wager supplies the usual interesting display of art
jewellery, and Wal Taylor some tasty book-bindings.

Victorien Sardou died in 1908. being then
77 years old; but his comedy “Divorcons,”
introduced on Saturday to Sydney Criterion
as “Our Wife,’’ shows no sure signs of
being an out-of-date brew. Margaret Law-
rence is credited with the adaptation, and
she has given herself a part which yields her
a great personal triumph, bringing out ’all
her vivacity in moods that trip over the
whole gamut of emotion played in a minor
key. Cyprienne, bored to death with an
elderly husband who. after a life of experi-
ences, has sought marriage as a refuge,
finds relief, with no idea of carrying the
intrigue to the length of actual infidelity,
in love passages with his handsome soldier
cousin, and hopes for the freedom a pro-
posed new divorce law will give. The
supposed passage of the law gives the hus-
band a chance to turn the tables upon the
lover, Adhemar de Gratignac. By an
arrangement for a future matrimonial re-
shuffle, the husband becomes the mere jolly
friend of a. wife grown full of suspicion
about women he may have in his eye for a
second alliance, whilst the role of jealous
husband is passed to Adhemar. The action
moves brightly on that thread of plot until
the curtain falls upon the happiness of a
lady who has so altered her opinions that
she is glad to hear that the supposed new
divorce law has no real existence.
* * * *
The Cyprienne is, of course, Margaret
Lawrence; an excellent foil for her vivacity
is the Henri des Prunelles of Louis Ben-
nison, who carries off some obvious mis-
takes in his lines with a polished ease. He
is best in the distraction of the husband in
the first act; but the reversion to indulgent
good nature in the sophisticated frivolity
of the later work is quite in character.
Barrie Livesay, as Adhemar, lacks ease and
over-acts in displaying the anger and sus-
picions of the man who breaks in upon the
diners in the last act; still it isn’t a bad
reading. Leslie Victor is responsible, as
nearly always, for a polished cameo as the
discreet waiter Joseph. The other characters
are all minor; but Billie Lockwood, bright
as the maid Louise, and E. Pirie Bush, who
is not at home as Bastien, provide a sub-
ordinate love interest, with Wallis Clark
heavily impressive as a grass widower, M. de
Clavynac; Byrl Walkley, designingly flirta-
tious as the grass widow, is among those
who make a generally satisfactory human
background.

At Sydney Majesty’s, “Ruddigore” bade
farewell on Tuesday night; "The Gon -
doliers,” which commenced its tuneful, course
yesterday (Wednesday) afternoon, will finish
its revival on Friday to allow “The Pirates
of Penzance” to commence their fling on
Saturday afternoon. “The Yeomen of the
Guard” follows on Wednesday; “lolanthe”
on the following Saturday ; and, after other
revivals have been given, the co. will step
outside the G. and S. repertoire to give
“The Chocolate Soldier.”

“Outward Bound,” with Zillah Bateman
as the lead, will displace the “Ypres” film at
Sydney Palace on Saturday. With one excep-
tion, the blue peter is up at the other shows.
At the Grand Opera House Nellie Bramley
changes (also next Saturday) from “Second-
hand Brides” to “A Little Bit of Fluff.”
“The Student Prince,” on present plans, has
little more than three weeks to live at the
Empire. Its successor is to be “Tweekie.”
Maurice Moscovitcli is too contented with
the houses “The Ringer” is bringing to say
anything definite about a change; but “The
Music Master” is in rehearsal. The one
exception to the epidemic is the St. James,
where “Lady, Be Good” has not yet received
even a hint to move on.

The Briants flop about as amusingly as
ever at Sydney Tivoli; and, in spite of the
arrival of King and Benson, whose turn is
entertaining enough, but contains some
matter suffering from old age, they share
with George Carney the chief honors. Brown
and Willa, who make pictures with strips of
rag, provide an entertaining act; and Rich
has brought back a scremale partner and an
astonishing facility for tying knots in his
legs.

It continues to rain much Mo at Fullers’

of absurdity is “Tickets, Please!” and con-

People who have three cheers ready for
the Australian picture owe some thanks to
the management of Sydney’s Crystal Palace,
which has followed “For the Term of His
Natural Life” with “The Night of Love.”
This is an altogether artificial production,
from the crude story of the gipsy chief’s
abduction of the bride of a bold, bad baron
to the long drawn-out posturings of the prin-
cipals before the camera. By comparison
with its immediate predecessor it is a froth
of tawdry rubbish ; what appeal there is in
it is entirely due to the sentimental slosh —
and that is mischievously unreal. The week’s
crop of new films is, in fact, suffering
greatly from the blight of unreality. There
is some laughter to be got from “Lost at
the Front,” the front being, in this case,
between Russia and Germany; probably this
venue is selected so that people may enjoy
to the full the sort of humor which consists
of the scared efforts of soldiers to dodge
shells. This is shown at Hoyt’s ; the Lyceum
gives Reginald Denny in “Fast and Furious,”
which lives up to its name. At the same
house “Casey at the Bat” brings the third

The film is making itself useful again.
“The Wonders of the Universe,” shown at
Adyar Hall in Sydney, explains by means
of ingenious models the working of the solar
system and the planets in their courses. The
laws of the universe are graphically eluci-
dated ; and the history of astronomical dis-
covery, such as the chance invention of the
telescope and Newton’s law of gravity, is
pictured most attractively. Genuine photo-
graphs of the planets and of the sun’s sur-
face are relieved by the adventures of a
fantastic ship that voyages through space
and discovers the amazing conditions of matter
in other spheres. The picture has many
touches of humor—such as the plight of the
voyagers when they find themselves beyond
the reach of gravity, and ludicrously float
about; and when the ship is travelling faster
than the speed of light, they see history
being unrolled backwards. As a lesson in
astronomy it makes a dull subject delightful;
while the climax, the destruction of the earth
by the collision of a star, is pictured with
enough sensationalism to please even the
ordinary movie-“fan.”

Art interlude in Melbourne :
It was a quiet day at the ninth annual exhibition
of the Twenty Melbourne Painters.
“Well,” said the portrait of Miss Edna Thomas
by John Longstaff, suddenly turning her sketchily -
painted but roguish eyes on The Bulletin critic,
“what do you think of us?”
“Just for a change,” countered that person, always
the perfect gentleman, “how about you people telling
me what you think of one another and of your
artists?”
“Hear, hear!” exclaimed Miss A. M. E. Bale,
irritably smoothing out the creases Mr. Will Rowell
had put in her costume. “I’ve been dying to say
what I feel about those futurist upstarts on the west
wall. Personally I think the nude lady is not
respectable.”
“Yes,” murmured R. G. McCann, Esq., blushing
deeply. “I don’t mind telling you that she’s been
making me feel quite embarrassed.”
“Fiddlesticks!” snorted Miss Bale. “I don’t be-
lieve it. Why, you’ve never taken your eyes off the
hussy since the show opened!”
SYDNEY TIVOLI.
George Carney, as an ice-cream vendor
and as a cook’s orderly making a dis
covery in a dixie.
“That’s not my fault,” plaintively muttered Mr.
McCann. “It’s the way Miss Withers has painted
me.”
“I once read,” broke in the nice, intelligent-looking
girl painted by Jo Sweatman, “that Melanesian
babies have boards tied to the backs of their heads
to flatten them. Mr. Frater’s lady seems to have
rather suffered from boards.”
“Oh, it’s all very well for you old-fashioned pic-
tures to talk,” murmured the unclothed one thickly,
“but you haven’t half as much to put up with as
we moderns. Look at my hair,” and she wept
bitterly into her feather mattress.
“Too right,” whimpered the vermilion-faced small
boy in the purple jumper labelled “Drowsy.” “Can
anybody tell me what is this piece of paint I’m
holding ?”
“Bah!” screamed the parrot in the yellow cage
tied to the purple clothes-line. “You people have
nothing to complain of. I’m cursed with a natural
sense of beauty, and just look at the back yard Mr.
Arnold Shore has put me in.”
“And as for me,” said a burnt-sienna tree with
no roots, “I ask you!”
“And look at me,” said a flat emerald jar along-
side. “I’m an attempt to express the emotions in-
spired in the soul by color; but the question is,
would I hold water ?”
“And would anybody want to eat us ?” shrieked Mr.
Frater’s apples.
Then all the vorticist still-lifes began to scream in
tones of purple and scarlet, the parrot uttered crim-
son oaths and the small boy made half-suffocated
green noises.
“Well, now you know,” murmured Miss Thomas,
momentarily closing one of her sketchily-painted eyes
as the critic made for the exit.
The Bulletin’s personal opinion is that the two
artists, Frater and Shore, mentioned in the above
discussion, are the most interesting in the show.
Stained-glass window workers by trade, their train-
ing has evidently led them towards their bold experi-
ments in massed color, simplification of form and
light analysis. Some of their work appears to be
deliberately ugly, but more of it seems sincere and
all of it is exciting. The rest of the exhibition is
like its predecessors. That is to say, the good work
is overwhelmed by the bad, and, owing to the
absence of a selection committee, the bad is pretty
horrible.

At Frances Alda’s final concerts in Mel-
bourne the enthusiasm of the archipelago of
listeners might be described as continental,
especially over the donna’s unorthodox and
exquisite rendering of Handel’s “Why Dost
Thou Leave Me?” (The lady is not without
a sense of humor, so perhaps there was a
gentle legpull in the choice of that number.)
The fact is that, Alda being the sixth concert-
giver to arrive in swift succession, the city’s
love of music is financially bankrupt. The
people who are still sticking* to it have
probably been to the pawnshop.

In Melbourne Louis Fifteen remains in
session at His Majesty’s, and the affair
between the monarch and Pompadour de Vries
is likely to attract plenty of courtiers for
some time to come. “Tip Toes” is still an
inconspicuous success at the Royal; and at
the King’s “Cradle Snatchers,” though for-
gotten by reformers, continues to have the
atttenion of mere amusement-seekers. Sheik
Robert Ginns is still the tempting, stinging
serpent of the desert at the Palace.
Flesh-’n’-blood melodrama isn’t much in
favor nowadays, though ; so the desert is in
no danger of overpopulation from playgoers.

While the Olsen-Johnsons are in the last
afternoons and evenings of their days at
Melbourne Tivoli, Edith Clifford, the Amur-
can comedienne, is but beginning hers. The
lady’s drowsy style, the lush sentiment of
her songs and the spiciness of her conver-
sation should help to postpone her departure.
Also her dresses are exciting. Fink and
Ayres are two cyclones on skates who snap
their toes in the face of Death. James Alex-
ander. who attempted a shuffle of 100 hours
recently, is Melbourne Bijou’s present mild
sensation. According to an advt., the young
hero is going to repeat his offence in Sydney.
Louise Fazenda and Jacqueline Logan are
delivering a silent sermon on the joys to be
earned by borrowing your employer’s dresses
in “Footloose Widows” at Melbourne Majes-
tic. At Hoyt’s Corinne Griffith is struggling
with a jealous husband for possession of her
child. “Three Hours” is the duration of the
struggle.

“The Golden Road to Strength and
Beauty,” at Melbourne Playhouse, could
only have been conceived in Germany. It
is propaganda aimed at an industrialised
nation which has lost—if it ever had—the
open-air habit. The German still can’t get
over the feeling that there is something
immoral and undignified in a Lloyd George
playing golf or a Lord Balfour running
about a tennis-court. Also the idea of play-
ing a game for the game’s sake hasn’t prop-
erly penetrated his serious mind. Hence he
invents a million cults to spur himself into
action. He doesn’t so much chase a football
as pursue an ideal of physical perfection.
The picture is full of naive statements, such
as “Only a sporting couple can have healthy
children.” Otherwise “The Golden Road” is
a highway of much masculine and feminine
beauty, though the back views of nude
women become a bit monotonous. This spec-
tator had the feeling that the Censor was
sitting in the darkness behind him sedu-
lously pulling the ladies to the right-about
with invisible strings every time they
threatened to outrage the moral conceptions
of Mrs. Grundy.
if >[: *
“Variety,” the new German film at Mel-
bourne Auditorium, is another reason why
the flesh-and-blood stage should eschew
melodrama. The principal figure is a huge
■ gorilla of a trapeze artist who dominates
each scene. When he moves on the gay
seducer of his woman with intent to execute
him, it is as if Mount Kosciusko were
descending on Dalgety. Various tricks of
lighting and perspective are employed to
heighten this effect, and the prevailing silence
makes it doubly impressive. The legitimate
stage can’t make a five-foot-eight actor look
like a Swiss avalanche. Also, it indulges in
too much fatuous conversation.

There is this about artistic Woman. She
can always be trusted to be useful as well
as decorative. When she dusts the house
she doesn’t forget to do it in an attractive
cap and apron and a touch of powder. These
remarks are introductory to the annual
exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society in
Melbourne. It is mainly Woman and mostly
rugs and mats and raffia bags and hand-
woven scarfs and nose wipes, all beautiful
and lasting. When Man creates anything
he writes his name all over it. This fas-
cinating show hasn’t even got a catalogue.

Melbourne’s all-electrical show opened
with a hurricane of colored lights at the
Exhibition on Saturday. The impression
given by the immense variety of new inven-
tions was that soon everything will be elec-
tric. The tramp who comes to the back
door will press a button and be informed by
the electric housewife that the woodpile has
already been sawn by electricity, and as
he makes for the garden gate an electric
watchdog will fasten on his trousers. The
next step, of course, will be to electrify the
tramp. Amongst the electric equipment
of the model volticised home, which is the
feature that is generally admired, are a
lawnmower, a cake mixer, a sewing machine,
a clothes scrubber and dryer, a hot-water
bottle, a cigarette lighter and a bowl of
electric roses. If the missus proposes to be
away all day the evening joint is popped
into the stove at 10 in the morning. At four
the electric clock turns on the heat. At 6.30,
the lady having decided to stay for the pic-
tures, the clock turns it off again. A Roman
matron had a horde of female slaves always
hanging about the premises, but the husband
of the future who is left to himself will have
to spend the evening chatting to the electric
dishwasher and disconsolately sniffing the
electric roses.

Vera Bedford’s concert in Melbourne was
distinctly an artistic triumph. Her chief
composition, a setting of Keats’s “Ode to a
Grecian Urn” for three voices, string quar-
tette and piano, was of good quality in tone,
harmony and technique. Miss Bedford took
part in this and was thrice recalled. She
sang a duet from Verdi’s “Aida” with Miss
Raie Levy, showing here a great improve-
ment in her voice-production; and her song-
settings of three Victor Daly poems were
full of charm. Alexander Raff sang Miss
Bedford’s “Oriana” ; which ought to become
a drawing room favorite.

By the time “Rose Marie” leaves the
Royal all Adelaide will have seen it from
some part of the house. At the Prince of
Wales Muriel Starr made a hit this week in
“Branded,” a play that handles the white
traffic. Miss Starr’s is a capital character
study, and Harvey Adams does his best to
date as “Velvet” Kraft. Hilda Dorrington
and the rest of the support is from passable
to good. At the Majestic the Stud Foley
Follies continue to show their versatility.
There is nothing outstanding at the pictures.
“Centurion” r Premier Lang’s passionate
desire to found a Government theatre in
N.S.W. to present “Shakspearean and classic
drama” may be considered as a revelation of
the old complex—-the low comedian’s insistent
hankering to play “Hamlet.”

“Shadbolt” : The only Gilbert and Sullivan
opera that has not been done in Australia
is “The Grand Duke.” It was the last of the
13 operas, and the least attractive, being
tedious and involved in plot, with sausage-
roll humor and tinpot tunes. It was produced
on March 7, 1896, had a very short run, and
has never been revived.
“De Oriel” : The brass band in that Tas.
township had turned us down. But we
wanted music outside the hall, so I saw the
Salv’army captain and offered a pound for
an hour’s playing. He would inquire, he
promised. He was punctual at seven. “I’m
sorry,” he said, “the band won’t play, but
we will pray for you.” It rained all that
night.
“Permanent Blot”: John Bedouin, who
had a part in “The Road to Rome,” is a
nephew of retired-Judge Bevan of the Pid-
dington Commission. He played a number
of character roles in Belasco cos., and re-
cently made some kiddies’ films in Sydney
as a side-line. As Leo Dietrichsen’s butler
Potter in “The Great Lover” (lie also
played it in Australia) Bedouin often met
Enrico Caruso. Caruso used to entertain
the actors back stage by doing lightning
sketches. He might have made a name as a
caricaturist had his golden notes not brought
him gold and notes.
“Hamfat”: “Ruddigore” was not an
initial failure despite an impression to the
contrary. Produced at London Savoy on
January 22, 1887, it ran for 283 perform-
ances. “Princess Ida” ran to only 246. At
its first showing “Pinafore” registered 700,
“The Mikado” 672, “Patience” 578, “The
Gondoliers” 554, “Yeomen of the Guard”
423, and “lolanthe” 398.
“Flaming Youth” : Undeterred by his dis-
appointing reception on the last occasion,
William Heughan is to pay Australia
another visit. The Scotch Burns societies
sent him out, relying upon the local organi-
sations doing their bit. A Victorian Burns
society suggested that the baritone would
do in its village. The suggestion
included* advice that 2s. and Is. would be
the prices members would expect to pay.
“C. 8.”: Melbourne Akgtjs has forgotten
that it once stigmatised “Cradle Snatchers”
as a gross show, destructive of the morals
of the people. The other day the holy
sheet printed a photo of two of the per-
formers in a luxurious embrace, with some
enticing comments underneath. On its cable
page. too. and with nothing to indicate that
the thing was an advertisement!
“Flaming Youth” : Two of the four women
required for “Our Wife” have sprung from
understudying to definite parts within a
few months. Billie Lockwood had her tri-
umphs before, of course; but it was when
she slipped into Judith Anderson’s shoes in
“The Green Hat” that she established her
right to parts on the straight comedy stage.
A night when Margaret Lawrence was off-
color gave Daphne Baird her chance in “The
Road to Rome”; and now, in the second
Lawrence piece, she shapes well as Madame
de Valfontaine.
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : The provincial
tour of Pauline Frederick continues to pile
up the cash for E. J. Carroll. Pauline’s
first visit to Manchester was so successful
that a return season was arranged. When
she got back the unfortunate woman had to
take 22 curtain calls. So the cotton county
is just as' crazy about picture-actresses as
the rest of the English-speaking world.
“Davigeof” : The old brigade of the Bland
Holt co. hasn’t thinned out very much (B.
8/9/’27). Charles Wheeler, Bland’s stage
manager for years, is with “Cradle
Snatchers,” after directing a Williamson tour
of “White Cargo.” Carleton Stuart is with
“Six-Cylinder Love”; Leslie Woods is a
member of the Nellie Bramley co.; and I
saw Walter Baker, Godfrey Cass and Violet
Canty “in front” not long since. Then

films, and Albert Norman, who was shot,
stabbed, drowned and buried more often than
most mummers, is in business. After 16
years the roll-call isn’t so scanty.
“Hamfat”: Although the verbal dressing
is as up to date as the frocks in the version
produced at Sydney Criterion, the coming
of “Our Wife” (Sardou’s “Divorcons”) re-
calls some stage history. The play was
first produced in Sydney by the company
brought here by Garner (afterwards of Wil-
liamson and Garner) in the early ’eighties.
Blanche Stammers (Mrs. Garner) was
leading lady; Annie Taylor was the comedi-
enne, Fred Marshall the comedy man and
George Titheradge played lead. It was pos-
sible to see the show, with a curtain-raiser
thrown in, for sixpence in the cheapest part
of the house.
“Hamfat”: A disreputable picture in a
dusty room attached to a Sydney play-house
tells the story. The star was under many
obligations to the stagedoor-keeper, including
payment of taxi-hire when she was short of
change. Her repeated “I will not forget you,
my dpar friend,” encouraged hopes. At the
end of the season the present arrived. “You
can take it home, my dear friend, and pass it
ou to your children,” said Lady Bountiful.
But the dear friend didn’t take the cheap
plioto-enlargement home. Now, covered with
tobacco stains, it illustrates the story told
to each new star as a good hint that cash is
preferable to sentiment.
“Hasen” : A cable states that “a studio
costing £250,000 is being erected in London
for the British Masterpiece Films, and that
Harry Lambart, an American, who is
managing director, says British films have
not succeeded because they lack punch—
that is the view of all American producers.”
But why omit all the other p.’s that might
well feature in the slogan of .so many
American producers? Pie, pathos, piffle and
pornography are some of them.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : The “East Lynne” com-
pany which travels no handy kid to repre-
sent Little Willie runs risks in picking up
strays. Our company unearthed a youngster
who looked quite cherubic when his face was
washed —the bribe of a bob facilitated the
process. With a powdered face, our che-ild
made a pathetic Little Willie, while' the
soubrette kneeling under the bed spoke his
lines for him. But curiosity prompted him
to take a peep at the audience. A full-
throated yell from a group of youngsters
greeted the act: “It’s ‘Stinker’ Smith!”
Stinker’s grinned acknowledgment was the
last straw. Willie died that night to the
accompaniment of laughter instead of tears.
“Cine Ma” : Not to be outdone, the Soviet
is preparing its war film. The gory business
in Petrograd is the engagement to be pic-
tured. The cruiser Aurora will bombard a
pasteboard Winter Palace, a celluloid Keren-
sky will be overturned, the streets will run
with artificial Red and White blood and
mobs will make off with the loot from burn-
ing chateaux, and won’t get their pay
envelopes until it has been returned to the
management. “October” is to be the title
of the piece.
“Cauboy”: A fresh danger threatens the
profits of impresarios who import piano-
ticklers. The most coveted seats at con-
certs are those which provide an uninter-
rupted view of the performer’s fingers; that
portion of the house is given over to intense
young things from the subbubs, who stare
fixedly at the magical digits as if they would
like to eat them. They are pianoforte
aspirants trying to learn how the great per-
son does it. Slow-motion pictures are now
being put on the market which show the
process perfectly, so soon the dears may be
going to the movies for their education.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Diana Wilson has a
part in a musical version of “The Glad
Eye,” with George Grossmith as producer
and Betty Balfour, England’s best film
actress, as lead. Other well-known people
in the cast are Allen Kearns and Robert
Michaelis. The piece is being tried on the
provincial dog, but London is sure to see it.
“Craiser”: The perennial outcry against
late-comers in Melbourne playhouses has
broken out, and frequenters of the d.c. at
His Majesty’s are specially vocal. Ingress
to this theatre from Swanston-street is along
an aisle that curves round the entire circle
from the entrance, badly placed at the side,
about one-tliird of the way up. Conse-
quently during the first act two-thirds of
the audience see about as much of the stage
as a motorist driving through an avenue of
trees sees of the landscape. The usual
remedy of shutting the doors when the cloth
rises is proposed, but no entrepreneur in these
days of fierce competition with the movies
would dare to apply it. Appeals to the
dilatory ones to be gentlemen and ladies are
equally ineffectual. The late-comer is a
beast of a special brew. He comes late
deliberately and because he likes the sen-
sation. The trouble or disease is prevalent
everywhere I have done my playgoing. In
Penang, in the Malay States, a producer
tried delaying his first curtain-rise till ten
o’clock, but it made no difference.
“Yaughan” : Talk of performing lions get-
ting adrift (B. 25/8/’27) reminds me. About
a score of years ago an illusionist was show-
ing at Melbourne Tivoli, one of his effects
being secured by the substitution of a real lion.
Jim Pearson, who came to Australia with
Bostock and Wombwell’s menagerie, was
the lion’s valet. Something went wrong with
the works at one matinee, and Leo strolled
down to the footlights, casting an eye on the
plump drummer, who left without saying
good-bye. The audience was unmoved,
thinking it part of the show, but the stage-
hands and the s.m, had no illusions. They
bolted. Jim alone kept his head: he rang
down the curtain. By then the lion had
strolled through the stage-door into Little
Collins-street. No one offered any objection.
Pearson, dressed in clown’s costume, walked
down the street beside the lion, and beyond
staring at the extraordinary sight nobody
seems to have been scared. Pearson headed
the beast into a lift-well and kept him there
until a lorry rattled along with a cage.
“Close Up” : Next year Australia will see
the German film “The Emden’s Exploits,”
English critics praise the picture and declare
that full credit is given to H.M.A.S. Sydney.
Fritz’s attempt at impartiality will be inter-
esting, at least.
“Felix”: Ted McNamara, who once worked
on a Sydney paper and later trod the Inky
Way in London, has apparently fitted well
into the pictures at Hollywood. He has
plenty to do as Private Iviper in “What
Price Glory?” Victor McLaglen, the star
of that piece, is a Maorilander. His brother
Arthur played Gabbett in “For the Term of
His Natural Life.”
“J.H.” : British Incorporated Pictures has
been formed, with a capital of a million,
to screen the works of John Galsworthy,
Philip Gibbs, Arnold Bennett, Conan Doyle,
Rafael Sabatini and others, with whom five-
year agreements for scenarios have been
signed up. An advisory committee includes
leading theatrical producers, artists and lit-
terateurs. Associated producing cos. are to
be formed in Australia, Canada, South Africa
and India, as well as distributing agencies;
and the American Film Producing Co. will
distribute the productions in the States.
Various British producers, players and tech-
nical experts now in America are to be
brought back to give the new co. the benefit
of their experience.
“Caul Boy”: I foresee a new threat to
the vanishing Australian actor. At a
trial run of the perkakas I saw the flat
image of a man open and shut its mouth,
and a stifled voice—like the corpse of a
gramophone speaking from the depths of a
sepulchre—issued or appeared to issue from
its pallid lips. Later the shadows of two
ladies danced to the very same music—or
the wraith of it—-which had accompanied
them in the original performance. It did
not make the experience any the less eerie
when my next-door neighbor whispered the
inside information that one of the dancers
had been dead three months. Then the photo,
of an English statesman opened and shut
its mouth, and the phrases of a long-forgotten
appeal to the British nation to arise and
crush a General Strike roamed around the
auditorium looking for a home. Next, the
spectres of two world-famous comedians did
their stuff, and their patter was clearly
audible. Then the simulacra of cocks crowed,
of pigs grunted and of railway-engines
whistled, and finally the celluloid remains of
the band from the Renown played to the
snapshot of a Sydney crowd in a photo of
Taronga Park. It was a horrible experience.
To any person still possessed of a decent
ear for music, an affection for the human
voice and an eye for a plump wench on the
stage the performance was a nightmare. But
the same thing was said about the first
moving pictures w-hen imitation trains were
made to appear to rush through photo-
graphed scenery.
IN MOVIELAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s something wrong in Movieland—
The shows run in a groove.
Where are the stars we thought so grand
When movies used to move?
Since Charlie took to getting wed,
And set his wives to raging,
We laugh no more; we weep instead
At tragedies lie’s staging.
For Gibson I don’t give a Hoot;
With Tom I never Mix;
I often feel inclined to shoot
When Tony does his tricks.
For Bill I never had a Hart;
At Jones I always Buck;
When Thompson plays a Western part
I marvel at his luck.
Since Mary left the silver screens
To actorines galore,
I've seen too many sweet colleens
To love a Colleen Moore.
There’s some I've glimpsed who made me wish
They never had been born.
I own I’m not inclined to Gish,
Or Shearer and the shorn.
They sing that Gloria’s glories shine:
I softly murmur, “May be’’;
La Plante’s no favorite plant of mine,
And Bcbe’s not my baby.
I wonder where is Mabel now?
Is Clara Young .too old?
We’ve still'got Fairbanks, anyhow,
And Barrymore tne bold.
In spite of fluff, and flam, and fake,
The screen’s not null and void ;
To cheer me up, I think I’ll take
A dose of Harold Lloyd.

In appearance and value, as well
as performance, Hudson is the most
talked of car of the year. Everyone
is saying there is “nothing like it
in the world.**
The Super-Six has the smoothness
of an electric motor. Four years
development led to full release of
its capacity in power, stamina and
safety. It led to a new chassis cap-
able of safely using the wide range
and long life of the motor. New
driving delights resulted. From
the effortless smoothness with
which the Super-Six whisks you
into motion, to the carefree way in
which you may make any trip
from a journey down-town to a
run across the continent, there
remains throughout the zest of
driving that is possible only to its
elastic and smooth flow of power.
Your Hudson Super-Six never
extends itself. It always has
reserve power for the approaching
hill or for greater speed. And its
four-wheel brakes with the flexi-
bility of the motor permit a flash-
ing nimbleness you will like.
The development of Hudson led
also to the creation of the Essex
Super - Six, a counterpart in
general appearance, smoothness,
comfort, quality, easy riding and
safety. Both are engineered to
low operation and maintenance
cost. The bodies are of such
variety and beauty as will satisfy
all demands for luxury and exclu-
siveness as well as comfort and
price advantage.

The Children’s Forest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAVE' been down in the forest, where the
wind sings all day long
All the sweet old tunes it sang in long
ago,
When our happy voices echoed first m
laughter, then in song,
Down the elfin ways that only children
know !
I have seen the fairy flowers, for I know
just where they hide —
In an arbor white with wild clematis
bloom,
And I glimpsed the purple splendor of the
graceful London pride,
Where the gum boles formed a perfect
little room.
I have been down in the forest, and the musk-
leaves whisper still
All the things they whispered when we
used to play—
Sometimes in the glowing gullies, sometimes
on the she-oak hills,
Young and gay, as only children can be
gay-
AH the fairy fens look lonely, and the tall
gums listen there
For the sound of gladsome voices on the
breeze;
Watch they too. among the shadows, for a
glimpse of faces fair,
Winsome faces ’neatli the boughs of
friendly trees!
1 have been down in the forest, where the
ferns are green and brown,
Furry fronds, that lip the surface of a
stream;
Maybe, too, they often wonder, as they
quiver up and down,
Why the little feet no longer splash and
gleam
Through the shallows, where the pebbles
softly shine like misty pearls.
And the golden carp are basking in the
sun ;
Where the banks are overhanging, and the
roots hang down in curls —-
Amber curls that stay the small waves in
their run.
I have seen the rare white violet, for I knew
just where to look —-
Fragile things are they with pretty orange
eyes ;
And they hide beneath the bracken in a cool
and mossy nook —
Where the leaves are dense and shadow
ever lies;
I have walked within our forest, I have
trodden each wee dell;
And it seems that everything is still the
same,
For the grey thrush hailed my coming in a
voice clear as a bell,
As he used to every morning that we
came.
There I lingered in the forest till the dusk
pressed all around
And I heard the shy brush ’possum softly
call;
While his bright-eyed mate gave answer with
a cooing little sound
That drifted from a clump of wattles tall.
And I saw the crescent moon gleam like a
fairy’s wing of gauze,
Caught among the silver tangle of the
stars....
But I missed the elfin voices, and the leafy
forest floors
Seemed so empty there beyond the sapling
bars!
I have been down in the forest where the
wind sings all day long
All the sweet old tunes it sang in long ago ;
When our happy voices echoed both in
laughter and in song
Down the elfin ways that only children
know.
I have been down in the forest and the musk-
leaves whisper still
All the things they whispered when we
used to play;
And I heard once more our laughter, as we
romped on She-oak Hill,
Young and gay as only children can be gay.
TASMANIA.
Norma L. Davis.
The Emancipist.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ONE morning in early spring . Captain
William Blake, Adjutant of H.M.
46th Regiment of Foot, received a
note from Governor Macquarie which filled
Ms mind with vague speculation and appre-
hension concerning the immediate peaceful
future of his existence.
He was busily transacting regimental
affairs in the Orderly-room at the Barracks
in George-street, when the corporal on duty
announced the arrival of a messenger from
Government House, who had instructions,,
said the n.c.0., to deliver a letter from
his Excellency to Captain Blake in person.
“Show the man in, Carmody,” said the
Adjutant, laying down his goose-quill pen.
and closing the huge ledger which reposed
upon the table before him.
One of the tall, wooden-faced troopers
who formed the Governor’s personal body-
guard, entered the room, clicked his spurred
heels together, saluted smartly with his right
hand and held out a letter in his left.
“For you, sir,” he croaked —“an’ his
Ex’lenzy said I was to take your answer
back wi' me.”
Breaking the seal, Captain Blake opened
a sheet of blue paper that was covered with
Macquarie’s tall, womanish handwriting,
and read the following cryptic communica-
tion :
Sir, —I have the honor to request that you will be
g-ood enough to attend Me here at the earliest possible
•Moment. I have also to request that you will
at once confine to Barracks all the Subaltern Officers
who are at present doing duty at Head Quarters,
until you shall have received further instructions
from Me. And, further, that you will be pleased to
regard this Communication as Strictly Confidential.
X have acquainted Colonel Molle with the contents
of this letter.
“Goodness !” muttered the Adjutant to him-
self. “What. in the name of Heaven?
Very well, orderly,” he said to the messenger.
“I will write you a reply at once.”
He paused in a puzzled fashion, as he
took up his pen again, pushed the ledger
to one side and drew a sheet of paper to
him. For a moment or two he brushed his
lips with the clipped white feather, and
then wrote: — , _ _
His Excellency Major-General Macquarie, Un.
Sir —I have the Honor to acknowledge your com-
munieation of even date, and to say that I will
attend your Excellency at Government House nmnedi-
atelv upon taking steps to comply with ypur Excel-
lency’s order with regard to the Subaltern Officers
of the Regiment.
“There,” lie said, as he handed his reply
to the orderly. “Take it immediately to
his Excellency. Er—by the way, orderly-
do you happen to know whether Colonel Molle
is with the Governor?”
“Yes, sir—he is.”
“Ah —very well. I will be over there
directly. Don’t lose a moment in delivering
that letter to liis Excellency.”
Having issued the necessary directions
for the internment of that section of his
brother officers to which Macquarie’s note
had referred, Captain Blake repaired to
his quarters, changed into full dress, called
for his horse and presently rode, by way
of Bridge-street and across the valley oi
the Tank Stream, to the vice-regal resi-
dence upon the further hillside. Here he
was at once shown into the Governors
office, and into the centre of a cyclonic
storm as to the probable devastating effect
of which he immediately formed the most
pessimistic opinion.
Upon the face of his commanding officer,
Colonel Molle, he detected that scowl of obsti-
nate determination that was wont to mean
the discomfort and harassment of the
regiment. And liis Excellency’s quaint
features wore the look of outraged dignity,
sorrow-ratker-than-anger, annoyance and in-
flexible resolve to have his way that was the
plainest possible signal of Macquarie’s inten-
tion to do, or insist upon, something or
other that would be very disagreeable and
inconvenient to anyone who might venture
to dispute its execution. It was quite obvi-
ous to Captain Blake that the commander
of the 46tli and the commander-in-chief of
the Forces were at very decided logger-
heads.
When Mr. Secretary Campbell ushered
him into the room the Governor was address-
ing Colonel Molle in a tone of the liveliest
indignation. He interrupted the discourse
to acknowledge the Adjutant’s salute.
“Pray, be seated, Captain Blake. I have
sent for you in order that, as a high execu-
tive officer of the battalion, you may share
in the hearing of those views which I am
unfortunately forced to entertain regarding
the conduct of its officers and to express
to its commanding officer. I must beg that
you will be so good as to give me your closest
attention. The matter under discussion is
one of some moment. Pray, find a chair. ’
He turned again to the Colonel and con-
tinued his harangue.
“And what, sir, is the story of this un-
fortunate gentleman—l am alluding to Dr.
Carnac, Captain Blake —what is his story?
Twenty years ago he was a young surgeon
in the Navy, and was serving in a ship
which became involved in the mutiny at the
Nore. He has told me—and I would no
more doubt his word than I would_ that of
either of yourselves —of the manner in which
the crew of his ship compelled him to remain
on board, when they put their officers ashore,
after inflicting a severe beating and many
indignities upon the captain. He had no
desire to side with the mutineers —though,
as most people have done since, he admitted
the justice of their claims. They kept him
with them simply as a matter of necessity—
as someone who was indispensable to them
in the event of there being any fighting.
They could not do without him.”
Colonel Molle was all polite attention
and deference to the Governor, but his atti-
tude of solemn depression left no doubt
as to his sentiments of boredom with the
subject. .
“And then,” went on Macquarie, the
mutiny failed, and the ringleaders were
brought to trial by court-martial. To his
amazement and despair, Dr. Carnac—
—largely owing, he thinks, to a grudge the
captain' bore hiiia—was arraigned on the
charge of mutiny. Gentlemen, we know m
our own service what chance a prisoner has
who finds himself before a court on such
a charge as that! How much chance is he
likely to have in the Navy, where mutiny
is, so to speak, the sin against the Holy
Ghost. Dr. Carnac was found guilty, and
sentenced to death, the sentence being after-
wards commuted to transportation for life.
So he came here.”
“As a convicted felon, your Excellency,
interposed the Colonel.
“Admittedly, sir. But u:as he a felon.
Not by any means, lie was a man who had
met with the direst misfortune —with a
misfortune that was tragic. Is there any
sentiment that the fair-minded could enter-
tain concerning him hut, that of pity? To
my mind, the doctor is deserving of the
utmost svmpathv and commiseration. He is
a man of the 'very highest character—one
whom I regard it as a privilege and an
honor to count amongst my friends. He
would ornament any society in the world.
And his talent and skill in his profession
are undeniable. Which of us here, in the
event of any of those near and dear to us
being in danger of death from disease or acci-
dent. would hesitate a moment in availing
ourselves of his services? None, I think —
none, sir.”
“Neither, your Excellency, do we hesi-
tate to avail ourselves, when necessary,
of the services of the hangman. But is
this a reason why we should admit him to
personal intimacy?”
Macquarie glared speechlessly at Colonel
Molle for a few seconds. This astounding
point of view was almost beyond his compre-
hension.
“Colonel.” he said presently. “I am at a
loss to understand such an attitude as your
words indicate. Ever since he has resided
in the colony the doctor has consistently
displayed conduct of the most correct descrip
tion. .My three predecessors—Captains
Hunter. Bligh and King—have ever held
him in the highest esteem. Tie has never
been regarded by them, or by anyone else,
as a prisoner. But for liis banishment from
the kingdom, he has been as free as any
man in New South Wales. And it is five
vears since, it. was m.v privilege to secure

I
KEEP DOAN S IN THE HOUSE!
PROMPT TREATMENT PREVENTS KIDNEY COMPLAINT
gACKACHE, urinary disorders, puffiness about the
eyes, swollen ankles, rheumatic twinges and dizzi-
ness are early signs of kidney trouble. Never neglect
such warnings! Rheumatism, stone, dropsy or incurable
stages of kidney disease may result. Keep a bottle of
Doan s Backache Kidney Pills always in the house.
Doan’s Pills are not only curative in their effect—they are also a preventive kidney medicine. Even
when well you should take an occasional course of Doan’s to fortify the kidneys.
TWO COMPLETE CURES.
Mrs. S. Schrowder, 29 Thomas Street, Balmain, Sydney,
says: “I can recommend Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills as a
perfect cure for all kidney ailments. This remedy cured me
some time ago of severe pains in my back and side, also head-
aches and giddiness. I was really far from well, but Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills made a different woman of me, six
bottles driving the pain out of my back, banishing the head-
aches, and restoring me to good health. Considering how ill
I was, it is wonderful that Doan’s Pills cured me so quickly.”
Seventeen years later Mrs. Schrowder says: “I have the
greatest faith in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me of kidney trouble seventeen years ago, and I am still well.
I always keep this medicine in the house now, and take a few
doses from time to time just as a preventive against any
return of my old complaint.”
TESTIMONY
FROM
SYDNEY.
Mr. Lewis Williams, 602 Botany Road, Botany, Sydney,
says : “I was a great sufferer with my back and the pain was
at times so bad that I had to leave my work and go home. I
was bent almost double and could not stand up straight with-
out increased suffering. I used various preparations, but only
got slight relief. Reading of cures effected by Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, I decided to try them. One bottle eased
the pain and the second completed my cure. This did not
happen yesterday, but about two years ago, and I have had no
sign of backache all that time, so it is not mere temporary
relief, but a perfect cure. I am always advising .my friends to
use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills and am glad to have an
opportunity to publicly recommend them.”
Fourteen years later Mrs. Williams says: “My husband
is still well and has been free of backache since Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills cured him sixteen years ago.”

Into pardon. For almost that length of
time he has been a magistrate of the Terri-
tory. He is one of the very best of citi-
zens. During the upheaval in Captain
Bligh’s time his conduct was unexception-
ably correct and loyal. You have no hesi-
tation in admitting to your Mess officers,
who in that affair were nothing else but
rebels and mutineers —men whose private
lives have been scandalous in more than
one ease. And yet you will not accord that
privilege to such a man as Dr. Carnac!
lie dines frequently at my own table —but
lie is not good enough for officers of the
-Kith to associate with. And he has now been
made the subject of gross insult at the
hands of several of your junior officers.”
“Can this be proved, your Excellency?”
“It might be —if proper effort were made
to do so by the proper authorities, sir. This
ribald caricature”—Macquarie picked up
a paper from the table —“was actually
affixed to the wall of the main guard-house,
whence it was brought to me by a non-
commissioned officer possessed of a feeling
of decency the lack of which is to be deplored
in some of his superiors. I do not think
you have seen it. Captain Blake. Pray
examine it, sir. You will observe that it is
drawn upon stationery such as is used in the
officers’ Mess of the 46th—embossed with
the regimental crest.”
The Adjutant rose, and took the paper
from Macquarie’s hand.
It was a not unskilful drawing of a tall
and very thin gentleman, very well dressed
and very professional-looking, who grasped
a huge knife in one hand and an amputating-
saw in the other. He wore leg-irons, how-
ever, and beneath the portrait was inscribed,
in large letters of print:—-
HILLY THE LAG—OR PRISON PILLS AND
PENAL POULTICES.
“An excellent likeness!” murmured Cap-
tain Blake, as he handed the paper back
to the Governor. “But a mean jest, your
Excellency—deplorable!”
“Exactly. I am glad to hear you say so,
Captain Blake. It is a disgrace to the regi-
ment that such a thing should bear the
regiment’s, crest and motto. And it must
have been done by one of the subalterns —
for I refuse to believe that any senior officer
would lend himself to such pitiful buffoonery.
Now could not something be done to discover,
and make an example of, the perpetrator of
this outrage? Do you not think so, sir?”
“Of course,” began the Adjutant, hesi-
tatingly, and looking at Colonel Molle; but
he was interrupted by the latter.
“I must protest, your Excellency, against
any notice being taken of an anonymous
affair of this sort. I would not insult my
officers by supposing any of them capable
of such paltry behavior. The paper might
easily have been abstracted from the ante-
room by one of the servants, and supplied
to someone outside the regiment.”
“Well, sir, do you not think the course
I have suggested would be a proper one?
Do you not think it would mark the dis-
approbation of yourself and your officers of
this —this unspeakable outrage, were Dr.
Carnac to be invited to dine in the Mess?”
The Colonel rose to his feet. “Your Excel-
lency,” he said frigidly, “we are obliged to
draw a hard and fast line. No matter whom
it may be, I must decline to permit of the
hospitality of the officers’ Mess of the batta-
lion which I have the honor to command
being extended to any person who has been
a convict. I have much personal sympathy
with Dr. Carnac, but I can make no excep-
tion in his case of a rule which is—er—
as it were, fundamental. I am afraid that
I feel myself compelled to decline your Excel-
lency’s suggestion. Have I your Excellency’s
permission to withdraw?”
Macquarie glowered at the Colonel as he
stood up. For a few moments there was
silence.
"Very good, sir—then it only remains for
me to refer to the matter in a General Order.
I cannot, and will not, permit a worthy
gentleman, and a most valuable member of
this community, to be grossly insulted with-
out publicly manifesting my disapprobation
of such a wretched business. I have the
honor to wish you both good morning—
gentlemen.”
Perhaps in the last word lay the suspicion
of a tone of bitter sarcasm.
* * * *
Dr. Carnac’s residence and consulting-
rooms were in King-street, on the southern
side, between iCastlereagh and Pitt streets.
In the garden before the roomy brick dwell-
ing-place grew two Norfolk Island pines, and
between them, suspended from a beam con-
necting the tops of the elongated gate-posts,
a red lamp glowed hopefully through the
night. The house was one of those spacious,
wide-verandahed cottages a few of which may
still be seen in the neighborhood of the
Hocks in Sydney, but of whose class many
still survive in Parramatta, Liverpool, Wind-
sor and Richmond. At either end of the
verandah were two small apartments, built
out to its edge, and the one at the western
end was the waiting-room for patients, be-
hind which was situated the doctor’s sur-
gery. The other was used as a sort of
casualty ward for victims of accidents,
where they might lie on canvas stretchers
whilst arrangements were being made for their
admission to the General Hospital in Mac-
quarie-street.
It was about half-past nine in the even-
ing of the day when Captain Blake had
been summoned into Macquarie’s wrathful
presence, and the doctor, having seen the
last of liis patients, was strolling up and
down his verandah smoking a cigar, appreci-
ating the coolness of the night, and pleas-
antly contemplating an early retirement to
bed and enjoyment of the rest which had
been denied him the previous night owing
to the somewhat complicated entry into
the world of a young Australian.
A tall, spare man of forty-five, with a
somewhat ascetic face, mainly noticeable for
the kindliness that shone in his bright and
deep-set brown eyes, Dr. Carnac’s appear-
ance would never have led anyone meeting
him for the first time to suppose that
he had ever figured in the muster-roll
of a convict transport. Essentially he
gave the impression of a man fitted for
and capable of responsibilities of a high
order, who might be confidently entrusted
to discharge them faithfully and well.
He had an air of being, 'above all else, sure
of himself and certain of his own abilities.
In his thin features might have been detected
some traces made by a period of sorrow and
affliction which, though it had not been
sufficient to daunt him in his conduct of life,
had nevertheless left its impression upon
his being. Behind the sympathetic manner
that had earned him the love and esteem
of those to whom he administered of his
professional knowledge and skill was an
air of personal reserve and aloofness that
forbade familiarity.
He had just thrown the glowing stump of
his cigar into the garden, and was turning
to the open hall door, when he became aware
of a little group of people who had arrived
at his front gate and were whispering
amongst themselves. He heard the click of
the lifted latch, and turned to look at the
party which came slowly up the garden
path, bearing a heavy burden between them.
As the light from the red lamp at the gate
shone down upon them he perceived that they
were four red-jacketed young officers of the
regiment in garrison, and that they bore the
inanimate figure of a civilian, carrying him
by shoulder and ankles. They came slowly
up the pathway, whilst he awaited them on
the edge of the verandah.
"Is it Dr. Carnac?” one of the group
asked, in a low tone of voice.
“Yes. What is the matter? An accident?”
“More than an accident, Doctor. Slay
we bring him in? We have a fear he may be
dead !”
“Yes, by all means bring him in. This
way, if you please.”
He led them along the verandah, through
the waiting-room and into the surgery,
whither they tramped after him, slowly and
heavily, bearing their burden.
“Lay him down there,” said the doctor,
indicating a couch. A single candle burned
upon the round table in the centre of the
room. Quickly the doctor lit three others
that stood in a row upon the mantelpiece,
and placed them upon the table, so that their
light shone upon the white face of the in-
sensible man. There was a little slobber of
blood about his lips.
“What has happened?” asked Dr. Carnac.
“Ensign Patrick Calder, nearly as white
as the young man on the couch, answered,
hesitatingly: “He’s been run through the
body, Doctor —with a sword. A sort of a
duel. I—l —’twas me who did it, sir,”
The doctor stooped above the body, and
began to undo the flowered silk waistcoat.
“Good Lord!” he muttered. “ ’Tis young
Corder, of the Commissariat. How did this
happen, gentlemen?”
lie pulled up the wounded man’s shirt,
and held a candle to examine the wound,
whilst the others watched him anxiously,
none replying to his question. Deftly he
worked, and swiftly taking bandages and
lint from a drawer in a cabinet at the foot
of the couch. Presently he had cleansed
and bound the wound. Then he took a bottle
of brandy and a measure, and poured out a
dose of it, which he forced between the
patient’s teeth. He straightened his back,
and turned to the scared group behind the
table. He looked at them curiously.
“Tell me,” he said. “The right lung has
been pierced, but ’tis a slight, clean punc-
ture, and has not penetrated deep. How
did it happen? Why did yon do this, Mr
Calder?”
“Will —will lie die, Doctor?” asked Mr
Calder fearfully.
“ ’Tis a dangerous wound, but not neces-
sarily fatal. He may pull through. Now.
won’t you tell me what has happened? You
know I must report this to Mr. D’Arcy
Wentworth, as head of the police.”
“You tell him, George,” said Mr. Calder
huskily.
One of the other subalterns took a step
forward—a lieutenant named Macready.
“Well, Mr. Macready?” asked Dr. Carnac.
“You see, Doctor,” said that young gentle-
man, a little unsteadily, “we had been
spending the evening, after Mess, in a room
at the King's Arms, in George-street. You
know—lsaac Flower’s place. A bowl of
punch, you know- —in fact, several. And a
little dicing. Corder here—l would not tell
you, were it not for Pat Calder’s sake—he
boasted ’twas him who drew that caricature
of yourself, Doctor, that was stuck up at
the main guard, and that he took some paper
from the ante-room of the Mess to draw' it
on. Pat, here, got very angry and cihcj
him a for using our paper, and
getting the Governor’s suspicions fixed upon
us. Corder insisted upon fightiilg at once-
there and then, at the inn. He struck Mr.
Calder in the face. It was necessary they
should fight. So we cleared the room, and
they went at it I acted as Mr. Carder's
second, and he used my sword. I’m afraid
we were all a little drunk, sir. Presently
Pat pinked him, and he struck his head
on the fender as he fell. Well —that’s all.
We brought him here, because we were
afraid to take him to the hospital. We
hope, Doctor, we hope the matter can be
hushed up. We trust you’ll say nought of
the affair. ’Twould be serious if you did.”
Dr. Carnac stood looking at the anxious
group for a good half-minute before he
spoke. Then, with a gently satirical smile
hovering about his lips, he reassured the
young officers.
“Well, gentlemen, I don’t know whether
you can feel that you may rely upon a ‘lag,’
such as I know you regard me, to do his
best for one who has sought to do him so
much injury as this young fellow has done.
But, if you can, pray accept my assurance
that I’ll try to save liis life. And, because
I was once in the King’s service myself,
I’ll shield Mr. Calder. But there is one
condition attached: I do not wish to be in-
vited to the Mess •of his Majesty’s 46th
Regiment. You understand. That would be
insupportable to one who had been a convict.
I wish you good evening, gentlemen. Mr.
Corder will remain here. My man will help
me put him to bed. I need not detain you
longer. You will, of course, account for Mr.
Corder’s injuries to his best advantage.
Good evening.”
Flushing a little, Mr. Macready stepped
forward with his hand outstretched, and
the others followed his example.
“No, thank you, gentlemen,” said the
doctor, bowing. “You do me too much
honor —too much honor, indeed, for a mere
emancipist, who well realises his unworthi-
ness to meet you socially.”
“By God!” exclaimed Mr. Macready, as
they passed out through the garden gate.
“We deserved that —by God we did!”
