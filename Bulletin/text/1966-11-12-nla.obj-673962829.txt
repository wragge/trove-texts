BOTTLES?
The current vintage of Barossa Riesling is
bottled in green bottles for those who like
their Rhine Riesling to be youthfully fresh
and crisp.
For those who prefer their Riesling to be aged
and rounded, with the developed character-
istics that come from bottle ageing, Barossa
Riesling is in the traditional European amber
bottle. Amber glass keeps out the light and
protects the wine while it is ageing. '
Because of the time it is held and the care
taken during ageing, the older vintages are
more expensive than the Riesling in green
bottles.
Since its inception in 1953, Orlando has won
more awards than any other Australian
Riesling - including a Gold Medal in 1964
and 1965 at Montpellier, France.

Killing Adult Education
Sir,
Sam Lipski’s article “Killing Adult
Education” (8., October 15) was an
excellent piece of objective writing, all
the more welcome in that it draws
attention to an Important social issue
which directly affects the Australian
public the recent recommendation
by the Universities Commission that
the Commonwealth should cease to
grant funds to universities for adult
education programs at the end of 1969.
On this issue, no one has spoken
up more vociferously than Mr. Colin
Badger, Director of the Council of
Adult Education in Victoria. John
Knox, heading for the cathedrals with
his hammer when Scotland turned
Calvinist, was no more zestful in his
iconoclasm than is Mr. Badger. Elated,
no doubt, by the fact that the Com-
mission agrees with his views to a
singular extent, he has appointed him-
self the national sage on adult edu-
cation and deemed it necessary to
launch a series of kamikaze attacks on
university adult educationists. Mr.
Lipski quotes him at length.
Mr. Badger’s opinions would appear
to be based on two premises. First,
that Australian adult education in its
purest and finest form exists only in
Victoria under the auspices of his
Council and that other agencies in
more benighted States should be
dragooned into line. Here I think it
only necessary to observe that the Vic-
torian Council has a professional staff
of four or five to see to the adult
educational needs of a population of
approximately three million and that
therefore it is largely a city-oriented
administrative machine. Obviously, the
Council does some excellent work:
obviously, too, it is not the only answer
to the problem. Secondly, Mr. Badger
postulates that Australian universities
should never have been directly in-
volved in adult education, concluding,
in one breathtaking generalisation, that
“university participation in adult edu-
cation has been most unsatisfactory”
and “I consider the arguments advanced
to defend the adult education work of
the universities are specious and un-
sound.” Here he is skating, heavily,
on even thinner ice. He is not only

presuming to judge and find wanting
the departments of adult education or
university extension of the Universities
of Western Australia, Adelaide, Sydney,
New South Wales, and New England
all of which have records which can
speak for themselves but he is
asserting that the innumerable universi-
ties directly involved in adult educa-
tion in the United Kingdom, New Zea-
land, the Americas, Asia, the Continent,
and Africa have for years been paddling
up a philosophical creek, oblivious to
the light shining from Victoria.
He allows that universities can
legitimately undertake research into
adult education and organise refresher
courses and other schools for graduates
and other specialised persons. But in
his apparent zeal for the abolition of
university departments of adult edu-
cation he overlooks the fact that many
of the,m —the University of New Eng-
land, for example—already do such
work. His entire thesis is bigoted and
educationally retrograde.
What should not be forgotten in
this unedifying controversy is that the
principle of university extension is at
stake. This principle is now under
serious attack in Australia but has
never been questioned in any com-
parable country. Quite the reverse. At
the Australian Institute of Political
Science’s Summer School on Tertiary
Education in Australia in Canberra in
1965, Lord Bowden, British Minister
for Education and Science, defined the
“three essential functions of a univer-
sity” as “research, teaching, and adult
education.” He further remarked that
in the United States 10,000 million
dollars, “at least a third of the total
bill for education,” is spent on adult
education, especially university exten-
sion courses, and that “the Russians
have developed similar progra,ms on
an enormous scale.” As society has
changed, so has university extension,
until it no longer plays a mainly
remedial role but encourages mature
people to think and to refresh their
knowledge. R. H. Tawney, described
by Hugh Gaitskell as “by far the
greatest force in adult education in the
20th century,” wrote in “The Radical
Tradition”: “It is possible to be learned
and a fool.” Sir Richard Livingstone, of
Oxford University, saw the need for
quaternary education as long ago as
1945 in his “The Future in Educa-
tion” and realised that universities are
the only proper institutions to undertake
it, “for they have the teachers, the
libraries, and the atmosphere and tradi-
tion . . . This is a new function for the
university—the organisation of Adult
Study, not for those who have missed
education in adolescence and youth but
for those who have had it . . . This is
the only remedy for that chronic intel-
lectual ill health from which, generally
without suspecting it, all of us more or
less suffer with advancing years because
we do not take enough mental exer-
cise.”
Again, universities are the intellectual
arbiters of civilisation, the voice of the
liberal conscience and of critical inquiry.
As such, they are the only possible
medium through which interested mem-
bers of the public at large can meet
to discuss objectively matters of social
or cultural concern. At the residential
seminars arranged regularly by the
University of New England, for
example, which are open to all, writers,
politicians, scientists, teachers, students,
journalists, and housewives, and anyone
te who wishes to exercise his demo-
„•i.*. , . . r ,
cratm ngh to take part in informed
study and free debate gather to discuss
se sujects as Australia s relations
wit sia, conservation, Aboriginal wel-
•um’- - tia< H unionism > an d the respon-
sibilities of the mass media. No other
Austialian institution could do this
necessary woik as effectively as a univer-
sity, ceitainly not a State Board which,
in the nature of things in the public
service, would be cautious about con-
troversy and sensitive to the leanings of
politicians. These are but two examples
of the educational work done by univer-
sity adult educationists, work which is
good for the community which requests
it, and good for the academic staff, who
approach it with enthusiasm. One could
dilate at equal length on other aspects
of university provision in this field, on
work in television and radio, in com-
munity development, in extension lec-
tures and discussion groups, in regional
offices in countiy districts—-all in
lesponse to a deeply felt need in adult
citizens who wish to learn. Work, too,
which is still in its infancy, which cries
° U tv /° J? e , developed to its full stature.
Mi. Badger is quite right to urge that
universities should be vigilant in their
scrutiny of the work in adult education
that they foster. He did not say that
the State Boards should be just as vigi-
lant in scrutinising their work, but he
would have been correct if he had.
Where he is quite wrong is in his
insistence that universities and the
society that supports them,, each clearly
needing the other, should Ibe artificially
separated and the connecting link of
adult education destroyed, lHe is wrong
to demand that all forms of aidult educa-
tion, including voluntary biodies, such
as the WEA, which have an honorable
tradition of independence aind educa-
tional endeavor, should be lumped in-
continently together into som e sort of
Big Brother State organisation. He is
wrong in his implicit belief tha t univer-
sities should become mere pro fessional
schools, catering for what Tawney
called “the bad utilitarianism which
thinks that the object of education is
not education but some external result
such as professional success or industrial
leadership.” He is wrong to consign to
the rubbish bin of wasted effort the
devoted work of countless acade. mics
who have taught adults informally— and
learned from them—and who h ave
given incalculable benefit and pleas; ure
to millions of people.
If the Federal Government were to
accept the uniquely anti-education; al
recommendation of the Commissiort,
then both the Australian public anc I
the Australian universities would be the ‘
poorer. But I suspect that Mr. Badger
is finally and most resoundingly wrong
if he believes' that the people would
accept either their exclusion from the
universities or his self-righteous smears
on the work that, for generations, with
humanity and care, university extension
boards and adult education departments
have carried out for the society beyond
their walls.

“On the way with LBJ"
Sir,
I am almost at a loss for words to
adequately express our appreciation of
your superb coverage of the LBJ Story
(8., Oct. 29). But to try to express
the feelings of this family is some-
thing we all owe to you. Apart from the
dailies which I have already sent to
our friends in America, I had so hoped
for a coverage by the weeklies. I think
that they fell down very badly in
practically ignoring the momentous and
thrilling visit of President Johnson —
absolutely no one but THE BULLETIN
made any mention of the terrific wel-
come so joyously given by Brisbane. I
think that Denis Pryor’s article really
got down to facts which some of us
regret are all too often forgotten. Yes!
THE BULLETIN really “took us back”
thanks for the memory and for all
you have always done to present the
facts of our alliance \yith America.
MRS. PHYLLIS DERRICK
Brisbane (Qld.)
Sir,
To me the most significant aspect of
President Johnson’s visit was the Repub-
lican aspect. Royalty never has, nor
ever shall be, so acclaimed. That a
leader of a Republic should be so re-
ceived seems to indicate that the
people of this nation are not necessarily
desirous of total alignment with the*
U.S.A. but that they would whole-
heartedly welcome similar political
arrangements, Republicanism.
To hear God Save the Queen con-
tinually played, with the U.S. national
anthem, was a source of continuing em-
barrassment to me. It must surely be
an international joke that Australia
appears so unsure of itself that it
must politically ally itself in so many
camps, at the expense of its own
national identity.
JOHN SWINBURNE
Biddaddaba Creek (Qld.)
The Style of LBJ
Sir,
Henry Fairlie’s interpretation (8.,
Oct. 22) of recent U.S. Presidential
succession as an intellectual-slob thesis-
antithesis proves beyond doubt to which
end of the scale the author’s own cate-
gory should be relegated. His vision
of the chaste intellectual mind vis-a-vis
the insincere professional politician’s
bears the marks of the .confused simpli-
fication that must result from thinking
in stereotypes. Mr. Fairlie evidently
sees the intellectual possessing a sort of
moral compound that is insoluble in the
murky waters of political opportunism.
His unquestioning acceptance of what
he has been flippantly told by politicians
of political decision-making is similarly
naive. Of course decisions are occa-
sionally made within set time limits and
on marginal issues, but that does not
make them irrational. Surely, too, after
his string of glib aphorisms about politi-

a great moment
for all
whisky
drinkers
Connoisseurs are aware of the vital part grain plays in pro-
ducing a fine, smooth whisky. Australian barley, grown
under ideal climatic conditions, has reached such high
quality that it is now recognised internationally for its
superb whisky-producing qualities. This is important for
Australia; it is important for the entire Australian Whisky
industry. For the first time our modern distilleries, with
their highly skilled blenders and strict quality controls, are
now able to create smooth, matured whiskies of truly
unique character.
This is the era when Australian Whisky has achieved full
international recognition—so much so that it is being
sought in increasing quantities by overseas countries.
Connoisseurs are already celebrating this new era. Why
not join in and enjoy a nip or two tonight? You'll be
pleasantly surprised.

Defence and Aid
Sir,
Several recent Press reports have
referred to the policy of the South
African Defence and Aid Fund com-
mittee in Sydney that all .members
must sign declarations that they do not
hold Communist or other totalitarian
views.
The South Africa Protest commit-
tee wishes to make it quite clear that
although it has on occasions co-operated
with SADAF it does not ask its sup-
porters or members to make any simi-
lar declaration. The general aim of
South Africa Protest, as incorporated
in its constitution, is “to campaign on
behalf of the oppressed people of all
races in South Africa and to assist
them in their struggle for civil liberties
and human rights.”
Membership of South Africa Protest
is freely open to all who support this
general aim.
Furthermore, the Defence and Aid
sub-committee of South Africa Protest
requires no declaration of any kind
fropi its supporters. Neither does the
Christian Action Defence and Aid
Fund, London, the parent Defence and
Aid committee, require any such declar-
ation.

Sir,
May I express my gratitude and that
of many Hungarian migrants to THE
BULLETIN for remembering the 10th
anniversary of the Hungarian Revolu-
tion in the October 29 issue, in the
form of Evan Jones’ beautiful poem.
May this country of ours and its Press
enjoy the freedom of speech and ex-
pression for centuries to come; for the
lack of which 30,000 Hungarians died
in 1956 and many thousands were
wounded, executed, and put behind
barbed wire.
MRS. M. M. KRASSOVICH

“Madam, he does not ..."
Sir,
Your editorial of October 15, 1966,
expressed surprise that the knowledge
that no youth has to go unwillingly to
Vietnam has not been made public
before. It takes some time to design
a circus act and practise the act before
it goes on public view. If the juggling
of words, the semantic sleight of hand
and mental gymnastics involved in your
specious argument are skills that take
time to master, this explains why your
dramatic conclusion has just seen the
light of day.
Your argument at the best involves a
fallacy of composition. These facts are
established: there are fewer men willing
to serve in Vietnam than the Govern-
ment wishes to have serving there;
youths have the choice of opting for
(1) voluntary service (2) service in the
CMF -at home (3) by default, taking
their chances in the ballot for National
Service Training. It is clear that youths
in general reject the first option. Let
us assume that all youths subject to
registration for National Service opt for
enlistment in the CMF at home. It
necessarily follows that there is no one
available for overseas service and thus
the number of men available for ser-
vice in Vietnam is below the number
required by Government policy, which
is where we started. What is the Gov-
ernment to do? Depend on volunteers
for overseas service or force youths to
serve in Vietnam?

Geon rigid PVC polyvinyl chloride heralds the breakthrough
in packaging bulky household products such as disinfectants, deter-
gents, and liquid polishes. If you manufacture a product in this
area, you should look at these distinct advantages: Unlike other
plastic materials, Geon PVC does not react to many volatile sub-
stances; it weighs up to 80% less than glass; it does not shatter; it
can be moulded in any shape or size; and Geon can be printed on
without prior treatment. Rigid Geon vinyl could be the answer to
your packaging problems. Find out by calling or writing to us today.

Emilio Greco’s Work
Sir,
While I am grateful to you for
opening your columns to Elwyn Lynn’s
suave comments on contemporary art,
some caution seems to be called for
when he refers to art history.
When he says (8., Oct. 29) “Greco
turns ... to Renaissance styles . . .
and what he borrows from the Renais-
sance contraposto and figura serpen-
tina is restrained by his love of
ancient Roman art,” he is apt to add to
the prevalent confusion and to com-
pound it, the more so when he goes on
to write of a particular work that “the
muscularity . . . and the energetic pro-
file recall the vigor, the civilised ani-
mality of a Delacroix,” —a romanticist,
opposed to classical painting.
Contraposto and figura serpentina,
first introduced by Hellenism, are com-
mon to many styles, in the East as well
as the West. They are found in the
late gothic art that preceded the Renais-
sance and in the mannerism that fol-
lowed it.
If “The Bather, 1956,” bought for
the Queensland National Gallery, re-
called in me anything, it was Dona-
tello’s “Baptist,” a gothic work.
I recognise in Greco a representative
of the neo-gothic era which seems to
be our destination and of which our
Opera House is an example.

THE HANGING OF NED KELLY
86 Years Ago: November 13, 1880
N ED , KELLY’S execution takes
place this morning, Thursday.
Visitors from the other land are using
their best endeavors to get a sight of
the concluding ceremony in connec-
tion with the great drama. Such is
the morbid taste of the ordinary
sightseer that if they had their way
Kelly’s suspension would take place
on the dome of the Exhibition. How-
ever, we are hoping for better things,
for a mass meeting of “ladies and
gentlemen” is to take place, a pro-
cession is to be formed with Billy
Gaunson at the head, and a march
made to Government House, to de-
mand from the Governor the reprieve
of the blood-thirsty miscreant.
M R „ BINDON, who defended Ned
Kelly, is a by no means experi-
enced or eloquent advocate. He had a
bad case, it is true, but it was,
nevertheless, painful to listen to the
frigid mummery of words addressed
by him to the jury, who tried the
outlaw, about whom a great deal
could, at any rate, have been said
ad misericordiam by a more accom-
plished counsel. But Mr. Bindon only
got seven guineas to defend Kelly,
and, though he did his best, no law-
yer could have been expected to
know much about a case for seven
guineas.

An Erosion of Faith
UNIVERSITIES, being the
uninhibited institutions they
are, are making all the predictable
protests about the financial prob-
lems they face. In N.S.W. they
have also taken action by raising
fees. This, of course, is a way of
going to the Commonwealth by
the back door, since it is obliged
to pay the fees of about a half
of all university students through
the Government scholarships’
scheme.
For two reasons it is unlikely
that there will be very much public
sympathy for the protests. The
first is simply that despite the cut-
back on the Universities’ Commis-
sion proposals there is a substan-
tial increase in money allocated
for the next three years $512
million compared with $390
million. A 10 percent annual
growth rate is not bad in any-
body’s business.
The second reason is that the
universities often present themselves
in a very bad light. Financed by
taxpayers as institutions for schol-
arship and teaching, they tend far
too often to appear as expensive
havens for alienated and rather
hysterical people who have little
concern for the search for truth.
During LBJ’s tour the public saw
this in the familiar parades of
simple-minded protest banners and
in the'violence in Sydney’s College
Street. It could, of course, be in-
ferred that these activities are
merely the newsy manifestations
of an unimportant minority. But
as Peter Samuel argues (p. 15)
there is evidence of an urlfiealthy
climate behind these outside symp-
toms, at Sydney’s universities at
least.
Some of the hysteria generated
among students on the occasion of
the Johnson visit can be gauged
by ithe state of the student Press.
This has been carrying out an in-
tense campaign against Allied
policies in Vietnam, employing
everything from full-page collages
of horror photographs to vicious
personal attacks on anti-Commu-
nists. The pre-LBJ visit issue of
Sydney University’s student news-
paper “honi soit” is fantastic
a front page devoted to a diatribe
against “Imperialism” in Vietnam,
a second page to a new propaganda
booklet getting accolades from the
Communist Party Press, a third
page to attacks on the Challis Pro-
fessor of Philosophy, David Arm-
strong, a Senior Lecturer in Philos-
ophy, David Stove, and Dr. Frank
Knopfelmacher.
It is not that the universities are
full of leftists. Far from it. The
trouble is that the moderate
majority allow their institution to
be dominated by an extremist
minority. The mass of students
stand idly by while their newspaper
is run by a group of irrational agi-
tators. And the fuddy-duddies
among the staff allow themselves to
be led into political lynchings by
professors who spend their sabbati-
cal leave in Peking stimulated by
the Thought of Mao Tse-Tung.
The Knopfelmacher affair remains
a nasty slur on Sydney University.
In the long - term interests of
universities, it is important that
injustices of this sort should be
subjected to public inquiry. (The
Knopfelmacher one still should be.)
As long as this sort of situation
prevails, there will be a continuous
erosion of public faith in universi-
ties and of support for their
financial demands.


THIS AUSTRALIA
LBJ’s Local Election
With Prime Minister Holt and Opposition Leader Calwell formally opening
their election campaigns this week, the smoke of political battle can be expected
to obscure, at least partly, the issues that the electors will resolve when they go
to the polls two weeks hence on November 26.
This election promises to be unique
in Australia’s history. If the intentions
of both leaders are realised it will be
fought on the single issue of the role
Australia is currently playing in South
East Asia, the consequences arising
from that role including Australia’s
military participation in Vietnam and
its use of National Servicemen there
and the relationships with both Asia.
and the United States.
As I hear it, Holt is determined to
put all his eggs in one basket in the
coming struggle. He does not want the
distraction of side fights over State Aid
for denominational schools, the state
of the economy, or similar things that
have a peripheral effect upon the out-
come of elections in recent years.
Believing, as did the late President
Kennedy, that “domestic policy can
only irritate us temporarily, whereas
foreign policy can kill us permanently,”
Holt wants the electorate to make a
clearcut decision on an issue in which
he believes the long-term future of the
Australian nation is deeply involved.
He wants an electoral result that can-
not be explained away other than as
support by the Australian people for
“Where do we stand on the alliance?”
the foreign policies that he and his
Government are pursuing. He wants to
force a situation in which the Labor
Party will be compelled to acknowledge
that whatever anti-United States, anti-
Vietnam, anti-National Service, and
anti-South East Asian views the Labor
Party (or the currently dominant
grouping within, the Labor Party) may
hold at this moment, these views are
not those of the majority of the Aus-
tralian voters. Holt may be able to get
away with making this, if not the sole,
at least the supreme issue. As I under-
stand his plans (and I am writing be-
fore he has delivered his policy speech)
he intends to come up with a further
modest instalment of State Aid to de-
nominational schools, not enough to
satisfy but possibly enough to calm.
The state of the economy might not be
all that the advocates of faster, more
spectacular, growth demand, but it is
certainly, on employment figures (and
these basically are the ones that matter
electorally), not in the depressed state
that it was in 1961.
If Holt does get away with making
foreign policy the supreme issue of the
campaign, it will of course be only in
the broad sense. There will undoubtedly
be individual seats in which issues such
as the decision to defer further aid for
the Ord River project or even State
Aid could loom larger than anything
else, including foreign policy.
And, even if he gets away with it in
the broad sense, it will largely be be-
cause Calwell and the Left Wing of the
Labor Party are anxious to fight the
election on the foreign affairs issue.
Calwell has already announced that he
sees Vietnam and the use of conscripted
National Servicemen in fighting in that
country as his election issue. Dr. Jim
Cairns who is possibly the Labor Party’s
most vociferous spokesman against Aus-
tralian and United States military
participation in Vietnam, has already
gone on record as saying that in these
days of atom bombs, foreign affairs must
be a subject to which radical parties,
including the Labor Party, must give
top priority. Other Left-wingers within
the Labor Party have a similar sense of
urgency about foreign affairs.
But while the Government parties,
Calwell, and the ALP’s Left Wing (I
doubt whether its Right Wing has the
same enthusiasm) agree that the election
should be fought on foreign affairs,
particularly as they relate to South
Vietnam and Asia generally, they dis-
agree on how precisely they should
conduct their electoral fight.
Holt and his deputy John McEwen
see the Australian-United States alliance
as at stake in the present campaign. If
Labor gets into power and keeps it's
pledge that it will immediately with-
draw National Servicemen and follow
this up with the withdrawal of all
Australian servicemen after consultation
with Australia’s allies, they can see the
American alliance withering away and
becoming meaningless.
This represents a serious danger to
Labor. If Holt and McEwen can suc-
cessfully fight the election on the simple
proposition: “If you vote for us you are
voting for continuance of the American
alliance. But if you vote for Labor you
are voting for the discontinuance of the
American alliance,” there would seem
little doubt about the outcome.
Whatever reservations the voters may
have about Vietnam or the use of
National Servicemen there, both parties
are agreed that a considerable majority
of the electorate desire the continuance
of the American alliance. And President
Johnson’s recent visit and the reception
he got from the bulk of the crowds
in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane
would seem to confirm the accuracy of
this assessment.
Calwell and the Federal Parliamen-
tary Labor Party undoubtedly realise
the possibly disastrous consequences for
Labor if the election is fought on the
issue of whether or not the Australian
voter wants to preserve the American
alliance. You did not see either Calwell
or too many members of the Federal
Parliamentary Labor Party supporting
the call of Senator J. Keefe, ALP
Federal President, for organised demon-
strations against Johnson even though
Keefe sought only orderly and legal
demonstrations.
QALWELL is making clear that he
does not want to fight the cam-
paign on the American alliance which
he claims is not involved in Labor’s
opposition to both United States and
Australian participation in Vietnam.
Allan Fraser, N.S.W. Chairman of the
Federal Parliamentary Labor Party’s
Foreign Affairs Committee, and con-
ceded by even his Liberal and Country
Party opponents to be one of the
shrewdest publicists produced by the
Labor Party for years (he has held
Eden-Monaro, which is in no sense of
the word a safe Labor seat since 1943),
clearly sees the danger.
In his weekly broadcast made after
he, Calwell, and other Labor leaders
had had an interview with Johnson (the
substance of which Calwell refused to
discuss), Fraser made very clear that
he was going to make his position on
the American alliance very clear. Said
Fraser: “Our party makes the American
alliance a fundamental of foreign
policy. We ought to. We established it.”
It will be interesting to see whether
the election is fought on the American
alliance (as Holt and McEwen believe
it should), or upon the issues of Viet-
nam and the use of National Service-
men there (as Calwell and the ALP
believe it should).
ALAN REID


The Embarrassing Mr. White
It was expected to be the lull before the storm of the election, a quiet week in
Canberra after the break up of Parliament. And not many journalists in the Press
Gallery read “The Canberra Times” public-notices section very carefully that morn-
ing.
But a few did notice the tiny ad-
vertisement announcing a talk by the
relatively unknown Mr. Bruce White,
Secretary to the Department of the
Army, on “The Ground and Air War
in Vietnam,” sponsored by the local
Royal Aeronautical Society. This small
group of aircraft enthusiasts was not
completely unknown. Just several weeks
earlier it had hit the headlines with
the claim by the beautifully named Pro-
fessor Bird, an aeronautical engineer,
that the Government was letting the
local aircraft industry “wither on the
vine.”
The three reporters who decided to
go to the White meeting were repaid
with the biggest intra-Government sen-
sation for years. It was not a matter of
one or two small indiscretions, but a
speech which, on point after point,
implicitly or explicitly threw doubt
on Government policy in Vietnam.
For a start, Mr. White appeared
to systematically denigrate the South
Vietnamese. Their leaders in the Army
and Government paid taxes to the Com-
munists and sometimes passed them in-
telligence information. “Local warlords”
wielded great power, and some were
most unsavory characters. Providing
some color, he described one of the
deposed General Thi’s favorite sports,
which allegedly consisted of a shooting
competition, with Viet Cong prisoners
as targets.
As if to hammer home the moral,
he declared: “This was one of the
men who dictated policy in Vietnam
until Ky broke his power.” Mr. White
did not have much time for the Ameri-
cans either. They took risks we could
not afford to take. They callously used
Vietnamese units as “live bait” to lure
Vietcong units out into the open where
American firepower could be brought
to bear. “We found ourselves in
Bien Hoa with the U.S. forces on one
flank, and the Vietnamese on another,
and we quickly decided the best place
for us was somewhere else.”
This, he suspected, was why we
sought an area of our own, even if it
did mean putting in a task force. The
war had since changed for the better.
The use of forces was more sophisti-
cated, intelligence better, but there were
still major problems. Fixed bases were
in dire danger from sneak attacks, and
the huge Danang airbase was only
saved from disaster in a raid early in
the year by the fact that 60 percent of
VC mortar bombs failed to go off. Luck
had also helped save our base at Vung
Tau.
Toward the end of his lecture Mr.
White stated his opposition to Ameri-
can air-raids on military targets in
North Vietnam. These, he said, were
not having any lasting effect on the
war in the South, or only “a very small
addition.” And they brought in train
“enormous consequences,” although he
mentioned only the involvement they
entailed in an air war over the North.
If the objective of the bombing was to
show the North Vietnamese people that
war does not pay, he did not think
it was very likely to achieve its pur-
pose.
In answer to a question, he said that
the supply of forces in the South would
be made easier by “taking out Hanoi.”
But this escalation could lead to the
Chinese taking charge in Hanoi, and
the alienation of world opinion. In the
quieter moments between the detona-
tion of these political bombshells, Mr.
White talked of the difficulties of
guerilla warfare and implementing Civic
Action programs.
In the furore which followed the talk,
certain things are clear, although others
remain a mystery. It'is clear the meet-
ing, like all others of the Aeronautical
Society, was open to the public and
hence to the Press. It was advertised
“all welcome.” The journalists involved
acted with complete integrity and sym-
pathy. One had agreed beforehand to
see Mr. White afterwards about any-
thing which-might be considered to be
“off the record” and did this, and
obliged by deleting a section of the talk
at White’s request. The other two re-
porters, although not bound by any
such agreement, did the same on hear-
ing of the request. So nothing that
White wanted kept quiet was published.
It is almost an automatic reflex for
public figures to claim they have been
“misquoted” when they put themselves
in an embarrassing situation, attempting
to unsay regretted words by making
scapegoats of journalists. But to his
credit Mr. White did not do this, al-
though the Minister for Defence, Mr.
A. Fairhall, did his best to uphold this
tradition after his delayed entry into
the controversy, following his return
from Vietnam.
There is great puzzlement in Can-
berra about why Mr. White spoke as
he did. It is difficult to see it as a
simple slip-up. Three weeks before an
election to be fought on Vietnam is a
dangerous time for a public servant
to say anything whatsoever on the sub-
ject. And it was not one or two in-
discretions but a whole succession. Not
that Mr. Calwell or the Labor Party
necessarily have any sort of a sympa-
thiser in Mr. White. Despite every-
thing he said of embarrassment to the
Government, Mr. White said two things
damaging to the Opposition case: that,
without what he called the “great flood
of manpower and materials” from the
North, fighting in the South would
quickly cease; and also that this was
a war in which we were dealing with
an enemy “which takes women and
children as hostages and clubs them to
death.”
But the case remains a serious breach-
of public-service regulations and
tradition, and the Government will be
eventually forced to “back or sack,”
as Mr. Calwell succinctly put the alter-
natives. The Minister for the Army,
Mr. Malcolm Fraser, would obviously
like to be able to choose to back the
man who, until this incident, has served
him well, but it is difficult for him, and
he has succeeded in leaving the options
open. They are now a matter for
cabinet.
PETER SAMUEL.
Honi Soit
There is growing discussion in Can-
berra about the reasons for the violence
and hysteria displayed by many of the
student protesters during President
Johnson’s visit. The first reaction was-
like that of Mr. Askin—the suggestion
that such violence should not be per-
mitted.
Senator Gorton, the Minister for
education (small e until after the elec-
tions) expressed this view as well.
At the same time he made an inex-
cusably dreary attack on beards. This-
approach may be to look at the symp-
toms rather than the disease. For
evidence is being circulated pointing to-
the political climate which is at the
root of the excesses which the public
witnessed during LBJ’s motorcading.
One is a copy of an open letter to
the authors of a recent booklet on Viet-
nam published by a Study Group of thfr
University of N.S.W. This shows in
25 pages of close documentation how
the university study group, while claim-
ing objectivity, in fact have consistently
misused sources and evidence to pro-
duce a propaganda booklet to attack
Australian and American involvement
in Vietnam.
Also being circulated widely is the-
issue of the Sydney University Student
newspaper “Honi Soit” published just
prior to the Johnson visit. To be seen
to be believed, this features a front-page
article calling on the “socialist camp”
and Russia, in particular, to threaten
“graduated reprisals” against allied
forces in the Pacific. It draws attention
to the fact that Soviet missiles have
proved their accuracy at 10,000
kilometers, to highlight the feasibility
of such a project. The article is in all
seriousness headed “Waiting for Lenin.”
It is not just sounding off, either.
For inside the newspaper is one of a
series of major assaults on the integrity
of anti-Communist members of staff of
the University’s Philosophy Department.
This issue of the paper makes it plain
that there has been a series of com-
pletely fabricated reports of apparent
statements by Professor David Arm-
strong and Mr. David Stove, inserted
with the intention of ridiculing them.
That the reports were invented out of
the air is admitted by the editor,

although he goes on to laugh it off
(saying he had a space in the paper
to fill) and to hurl more abuse.
These are being recognised as the
techniques which were used to dis-
credit Dr. Frank Knopfelmacher. On
the basis of gross misrepresentation or
complete fakery, with plentiful applica-
tions of ridicule and invective, ex-
tremists are able to make the target
man a figure who is widely regarded
as “controversial.”
University councils and governments
stand completely aside in deference to
actual and anticipated screams of
“academic freedom.” The result is
that academic careers of men are un-'
justly injured, and the whole political
atmosphere of universities increasingly
shifted against those who will resist the
influence of the extreme-Left.

"Are you voting for LBJ or I PEC?"
Police Assault
A pamphlet released last week by the
Monash University Students’ Represen-
tative Council, “Facts about the anti-
LBJ demonstration,” contains a list of
alleged acts of violence by police and
security officers against demonstrators
on the day of President Johnson’s visit.
The pamphlet admits that in some
cases the police may have been pro-
voked, but claims that there were many
instances of unprovoked violence, petty
harassment, and assaults on demon-
strators and bystanders by both uni-
formed and plainclothed police. Evi-
dence is also offered that some of the
unwarranted assaults were carried out
by American security men.
Among the evidence of unprovoked
assault and needless brutality is a state-
ment from Melbourne clergyman
Reverend Peter Lane: “With no further
warning or preliminary action, this
policeman began to hit me. The ferocity
and brevity of the attack make full
details unclear, but he delivered at least
two blows, a ‘fore-arm jolt’ to my
upper jaw and nose; and a knee to my
groin. I was also struck punches in the
ribs by at least one, and probably two,
uniformed police. I do not believe that
clergy are entitled to special treatment,
but it is perhaps interesting to note that
I was wearing clerical dress at the
time.”
Most of the assaults are alleged to
have taken place in St. Kilda Road and
outside nearby Government House after
President Johnson’s car sped past.
Typical statement is that made by
student Marc Radzner:
“At this point, he started to push me
along. As we were crossing the stretch
of lawn which forms a large V betwee in
Government Drive and St. Kiilda Roac 1,
there was an uproar on our left and w« e
saw both policemen and plainclothes ?
men hitting and beating young men
and girls. Then we heard screams and
I saw one young man being held by
several policemen and being hit and
bashed over the head with truncheons.”
Most of the charges made are veri-
fied by other witnesses and many of
them have been investigated by a special
committee set up by the Victorian
Labor Party. The committee (which in-
cludes three solicitors) has issued a re-,
port which claims that there is prima
facie evidence that plainclothes and
security men acted as provocateurs,
assaulted citizens without due cause,
and provoked incidents without regard
for age or sex.
Allowing for the possibilities of some
student exaggeration and the ALP’s
natural desire to gain political capital,
the evidence so far produced is firm
enough for alarm, and demands
thorough civic investigation. Demon-
strators who broke the law have in most
cases been brought to trial. Justice will
not be balanced until demonstrators’
complaints against unprovoked violence
and arbitrary assault are also given fair
trial.

Tourism is now among Australia’s
top 12 foreign-exchange earners, yet
its official organisation is still struggling
along on a midget, pre-jet budget. In
1965, 192,000 overseas tourists came
here and left a handsome $64 million
in foreign currency.
Yet to go on enticing this sort of
trade and money, the Australian
National Travel Association has to
struggle along on a budget of only
$1,125,000 a year to advertise, promote,
co-ordinate, and research present and
future demands. Last year, ANTA got
in an American research outfit to probe
itself and give some projections on
Australian tourism. One of its most
important recommendations was that
ANTA be considerably expanded and
be given the status of an autonomous
authority, board, commission, or cor-
poration under Government auspices—
something like the Australian Broad-
casting Commission. ANTA itself,
naturally, would like this, too, and
prepared a big case for itself for the
Government.
The Deputy Prime Minister and
Trade Commissioner, Mr. McEwen—
the newly constituted body would come
under the Trade Department told
Parliament that the Government was
giving it all a lot of thought. He
sounded hopeful.
As it operates at present, ANTA gets
most of its budget from the Common-
wealth Government, anyway: $862,000
last year. State Governments gave an-
other $40,000 and travel organisations
—airlines, shipping companies, hotel/
motel groups —gave $225,000. At pres-
ent, it is representatives from these
firms, along with Commonwealth and
State Governments’ representatives, who
make up the 30-member ANTA board.
ANTA’s present troubles stem from
the fact that its business has outgrown
its organisation.
It was founded back in the tourism
long-ago of 1929, when international
tourism particularly to Australia
was nothing compared with today.
Then, what tourism we had in this
country was all self-contained: Queens-
landers holidayed in Sydney and the
Blue Mountains, Victorians went to
Tasmania. New supersonic superjets
and recently announced lower fares
will mean that by 1975—according to
these recent American researchers —we
will be drawing 600,000 overseas
tourists a year, and by then will need
an additional 46,000 hotel and motel
rooms to accommodate them.
Mr. McEwen’s statement to Parlia-
ment indicated that he had investigated
what the Association had laid before
him sufficiently for him to reveal that
the States would be asked to play a
greater role in the envisaged new
tourist adventure by appointing State
Ministers of Tourism. This is what
some of the more tourist-conscious
countries elsewhere have done, and it
is obviously paying dividends.
It is plain that by broadening the

existing authority and giving it more
money and power, expenditure of a
few extra million dollars will be as
the releasing of sprats to catch well-
laden mackerels. All this may leave
the future of “Walkabout,” ANTA’s
monthly magazine, somewhat in doubt.
But it is proving such a successful ven-
ture promotionally and financially that
that doubt should not last for long.
... and Going
Few, if any, can say with much certi-
tude exactly why so many New Aus-
tralian migrants return after a while to
the lands of their origins. It is clear
also that a good many of those who
leave do not themselves know.
This is about the most concrete thing
that came out of a fairly comprehen-
sive survey, done by the Commonwealth
Immigration Advisory Council’s com-
mittee, on social patterns and its find-
ings released last week. In some years
the returnees number as many as 16
percent of arrivals, in others they can
be as few as 9 percent. Things like
money, housing, incomes, job oppor-
tunities seem to have strangely little to
do with their returning motivations.
These were reasons some returnees
gave, but they were tiny numbers com-
pared with those who gave an unusual
variety of purely emotional reasons.
Just plain homesickness, particularly
among women, was an outstanding
factor. And this was often accentuated
if the women in question had left
parents behind who kept writing letters
about all the minor doings back at
home.
Other factors that could also be listed
as emotional, but with undertones of
greater urgency, were things like a
death occurring in the family back at
home, a broken romance at this end, a
marriage offer or acceptance at that
end, or chances of improving pros-
pects with their careers by going back.
Another factor that kept cropping up
with surprising regularity was that many
just wanted to keep on the move. This,
the survey researchers felt, was just a
modern day phenomenon.
Some low-intelligence returnees could
have their returning reasons written-off
fairly accurately to immaturity. Any-
thing new to them seemed a wilder-
ness. But there are high-intelligence
returnees, too, some of whom gave as
their reasons the fact that their quali-
fications were not adequately recognised
here or that they had trouble making
friends at their own intellectual level.
Yet, overall, the immigration re-
searchers were a bit wary of accepting
too much of what they had been told
at face value. One of their researchers,
for instance, quizzed a group of re-
turnees on the boat back to Europe and
they all gave him their reasons for quit-
ting. A year later he interviewed them
again back in their homes in their home
countries —and most gave different
reasons.

White-Collar Power
Rarely capturing the headlines and disguised to even some of their own members
under a bewildering array of initials (AAESDA, ACOA, ACSPA, and HCCPSO
are some), white-collar unions and their co-ordinating councils are growing fast
in industrial and political power.
As a percentage of the national work
force, white-collar workers are increas-
ing. White-collar workers now number
more than 1,500,000, of whom it is
estimated that about one-third are in
unions.
Most white-collar unions are affili-
ated loosely under the banners of
ACSPA, the HCCPSO, or the CPA
(the Council of Professional Associa-
tions). ACSPA, the largest of these and
representing about 250,000 members,
was formed in 1956 and its first presi-
dent and secretary, Mr. Paul Alsop
and Mr. Rees (“Barney”) Williams
remain in office.
(For readers who have tested their
skill the initials stand for The Associa-
tion of Architects, Engineers, Surveyors,
and Draughtsmen of Australia, the
Administrative and Clerical Officers’
Association, the Australian Council of
Salaried and Professional Associations,
the High Council of the Common-
wealth Public Service Organisations.)
There are now developing three sig-
nificant movements in the white-collar
field.
• ACSPA is working strongly for
closer liaison and co-operation with the
HCCPSO, and also to get the Federa-
tion of State Public Service Organisa-
tions to affiliate with ACSPA;
• ACSPA officials are planning to re-
organise their own structure in the next
few months so that elections will be
conducted on an industry group basis,
a change which will attract outside
white-collar organisations;
• Some officials of ACSPA are working
for an eventual top-level merger with
the 1,200,000-strong ACTU.
The forces operating against these
moves for greater industrial unity are
both professional and political. In the
first case, white-collar unions tend to
split roughly into professional and
clerical divisions. Respective examples
are, say, the Association of Professional
Engineers of Australia, and the Clerk’s
Union. Claims for wages and conditions
by one group may not necessarily be
supported by the other. Allegations
of snobbery on the one hand and sub-
professional envy on the other are not
uncommon.
Political divisions which will make
the drive to greater unity difficult are
the result of hostility between pro-
Communist and anti-Communist, and
pro-ALP and anti-ALP factions. The
pros and antis do not completely over-
lap.
A battle among these forces is now
cfccurring in the ACOA. It dates from
the 1961 Federal election when the
New South Wales Branch Secretary,
Mr. Don Thompson, sponsored an
ACOA campaign against the then
Minister for Labor and National Ser-
. .
vice, Mr. McMahon, in the seat of
Ve ' _ ,
At a Federal Executive meeting
earlier this year, the Tasmanian branch
of the ACOA moved a resolution object-
ing to this and other activities of
Thompson and his supporters. In part
11 .". ad ■■ in ™ w . of the dimension
within the association membership
caused by the publication of ‘Journal’
items with a political bias prior to the
last Federal election the Federal
executive take action. ... so that the
association attitude of a neutrality in
politics is not infringed . , .” The
particular reference here was to the
New South Wales section publishing in
the ACOA “Journal” a balance sheet
of the debits of the Liberal Government
and the credits of the Labor Party.
The dissension within the ranks was
increased when it was learnt that
Thompson, who last year provoked a
work-to-regulatioijs strike, was a former
Secretary of the Building Trades
Federation when that union imposed a
black ban on building construction at
the Woomera Rocket Range in the days
of the Chifley Government.
A number of Liberal, DLP, and mod-
erate ALP supporters are working
against the Thompson faction in the
current ACOA elections, on the agree-
ment that the importation of party
politics has been bad for the union and
under a tacit understanding that the
ACOA keep out of politics in future.
The non-Communist but pro-ALP
leaders of some associations affiliated
with ACSPA may stir up similar
trouble if they attempt to link them-
selves too closely with the ALP. The
plan of some of these officials is firstly-
to join with the ACTU, and then to
link up with moderate ALP forces in
an attempt to dislodge the inefficient
and pro-Communist leaders of the Vic-
torian and Queensland Labor parties.
Since a majority of white-collar
unionists are not Labor supporters, this
plan is not likely to go unchallenged.
BRIAN BUCKLEY
Adelaide’s Sons-in-Law
In Adelaide the practice of the law tends to descend from father to son more
exclusively than it does even in Hobart. In the fullness of time Messrs. Cobbins and
Cobbins give way to Messrs. Cobbins, Cobbins, AND Cobbins. It has been a
restricted dynasty, partly by design.
There was for years a nodding agree-
ment that the field was better kept
small. It was not that outsiders were
kept out or failed till they lost heart.
They were simply not encouraged. The
law’s brass plate was kept dull and a
bit Dickensian. That people made
money in law was dear enough, of
course. Some became judges, which in
South Australia is as near as you can
come to Olympus, and took perman-
ently to striped trousers, black hom-
burgs, and, in the old days, beards. One
or two like Sir George Murray in the
’2os and ’3os took their majestic pro-
motion so seriously that they thought it
out of place even to “go into society.”
But while the law glowed at the top
and looked comfortably solid in its
well-established centre, it was grubby
round the edges. There were poor
lawyers then, as there were poor archi-
tects, and the young kept away. Tlje
extraordinary thing about the Messrs.
Cobbins is that they were either an
infertile lot or else they held the
ring so well they kept their numbers
down as effectively as the Pinjarras.
There was a Malthusian awareness of
the dangers of over-population of
too many people living off too few
briefs. How else explain the fact that
there are today only 80 more lawyers
practising in South Australia than there
were in the Depression year 1934.
The Adelaide Law School enrolments
are even more astonishing. Even as
late as 1955, when every other profession
was filling rapidly, the Law School held
a .mere 72, with 16 in the first year,
Today there are 380 in the school
( equ al to the number of practising*
lawyers), with 140 sweating it out hope-
fully in the first year .
r , ,
, "f w were medicine, directly
related to population growth, there
would be room and to spare for every-
body. The trouble in South Australia
that the legal cake on which every-
body has to live has not expanded fast
enough to accommodate all the new
prospective diners. Too many slices
have gone elsewhere to land agents,
stockbrokers, accountants and trustee
companies.
And it is largely in the hope of get-
ting some parts of these slices back that
the Law Society has decided on a
public-relations campaign to improve its
public image
The ai is be launched to
coincide w & * he national Lega , Con _
vention to be held in Adelaide next
July. The law will then be seen not
only i n its full glory of wiggery and
robery (as J. B. Priestley once called
it) but also, one fancies, as the Public’s
Friend. The Chief Justice of the High
Court in Australia, Sir Garfield Bar-
wick, gave the image-polishing his bless-
ing when he was in Adelaide recently
by agreeing that it was necessary to “en-
lighten the public on what we do for
them and how much thoroughly
selfish effort is put in by a lawyer.”
A public-relations firm has been re-
tained, and the Law Society is levying

an extra year’s subscription to cover
expenses. It will finance the cost of the
Legal Convention with still another
year’s fees. It seems odd that the
Society should be advertising its inten-
tion to give the profession a better pub-
lic face. But this suggests a certain un-
worldliness in what is usually regarded
as the worldliest of all professions, that
may be no bad thing.
The main working method, appar-
ently, will be to present a series of case
histories to show the public some of the
commoner traps it can avoid falling
into by consulting a lawyer before
signing that contract, before making,
that will, before accepting that lease,
perhaps, also, before walking out on
that wife.
Obviously the law is out to tread on
the toes of those people who have
moved in on what used to be sovereign
legal territory; but it will be done, of
course, with traditional politeness. The
profession’s worst grievance in South
Australia is that for a hundred years it
has been kept on the outskirts of the
land-brokerage business, in other States
one of the most profitable forms of
legal income. The result is a certain
land hunger.
THERE are all sorts of encroachers.
Among the most recent is the New
Australian who, starting off perhaps as
an interpreter, is soon offering advice
to other New Australians on everything
from hire-purchase to that area of re-
fined specialisation the income-tax
return.
What does the public think of law-
yers? It should make an interesting
survey if one is made. No doubt the
relationship between a solicitor and his
more regular clients can be as cosy as
that of the surgery; only it is unusual
to hear of it. There is a strange loyalty
even to dentists that must leave many
lawyers envious, all the more so since
the commonest suspicion held of
lawyers, that they overcharge, is now
fastened firmly on dentists as well.
In every State the law is proud of
its legal-aid systems, and no doubt the
South Australian one will be given its
due place in the image-improving cam-
paign. But, what fascinates the public
is not the discovery that so much good
is done by stealth, as the money that
can be made in the practice of the
law, even if only by the few. For in-
stance, Mr. A. K. Sangster, QC, the
president of the Law Society, was paid
a fee of $ll,OOO plus $2lO for every
sitting day of the inquiry which he
conducted into the State’s archaic
liquor laws.
According to the Attorney-General,
Mr. Don Dunstan, that is “a normal
charge for a man of Mr. Sangster’s
standing. It is what you would pay
for his services in court.”
Exactly.

OVERSEAS
A Fortress Singapore
ONE of Lee Kuan Yew’s troubles is
that he just has to act tough.
Somewhere, sometime in the
past he forced himself to believe that
the warm, human touch gets you no-
where in politics. The well-displayed
mailed fist achieves more than the
concealed nudge; the soft word may
turn away wrath but the tough speech
brings in votes.
So it is that one Singapore journa-
list has never lost a standing bet that
Lee cannot make a speech without at
some stage waving a clenched right fist.
So it is that Lee’s speeches are studded
with the words of combat—“endure,”
“survive,” “struggle,” “fight.”
When, on very rare occasions, Lee
the human being becomes fleetingly
visible (as when he cried over separa-
tion) one suspects Kuan Yew is not all
that happy about it. He is not the
Machiavellian monster his enemies
dream about, but he is not averse to
portraying himself as such. As much
English as he is Chinese, Lee simply
has to hide and conceal his emotions
and feelings. Watch him in Parliament
or on the platform, and the pursed lip,
the heavy frown, the bull-dog intensity
never give way to the charm he can
exert if he so wishes. An Asian Karsh
stands to get a photographic scoop if
he clicks on Kuan Yew confronted with
the baby-kissing routine of many
democracies.
A s for their leader, so for the PAP
politics means a fight. First against
the British, then against the Barisan
Socialists, this was all very well. Hav-
ing won both battles, the PAP bat-
talions turned north to take on the
Alliance with the same zestful abandon.
“If we can defeat the British and the
Communists, then we won’t have any
trouble with these chaps,” one Minister
told pie. But, since the Malaysians play
it different, they did, and came a crop-
per. Now the PAP are in worse trouble.
Internally there is no one to fight;
externally, too, more and more, no
one gets into the ring with thejn,
either, since they can do their “fight-
ing” from a long way off.
This, it would seem, is at the root
of Singapore’s troubles. Internally, the
Barisans, imbued with the exuberance
of their own verbose ideology, have re-
fused to play it according to the rules.
Those in control refused to accept
Singapore’s independence for real,
deeming it a plot of the good old
“Anglo-American imperialists.” Par-
liament and by-elections have also
been dubbed “phony.” Until recently
they were boycotted, but now all Bari-
san MPs have tendered their resigna-
tions, preferring to take their case “on
to the streets” rather than to articu-
late it. Their aim is a “genuinely in-
dependent, democratic, united Malaya
(including Singapore).” This would be
fine as an ideal except that a quick
perusal of any party publication makes
it clear that according to the Barisans
this can only come about when socialist
(or as their enemies would say quasi-
Communist) governments are in power
in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.
Were an election to be held soon
(or by-elections in the nine seats the
Barisans have vacated) it is certain the
PAP would be returned with an over-
whelming .majority. The only really
doubtful PAP victories would be the
three Malay-majority constituencies.
Since, with another display of Lee
heavy-handedness (and as a childish
tit-for-tat for earlier Malaysian actions
toward the ex-PAP up nprth), the
Singapore UMNO has been told to
change its name and symbol if it de-
sires registration, which it has so far
refused to do, even these seats may well
fall into the all-embracing PAP grasp.
This prospect hardly pleases. The
good work they still do aside, what the
PAP badly needs it is unlikely to get
sustained articulate and rational
criticism of the position it is taking
in the absence of an “enemy.”
Meanwhile, day in and day out, the
PAP emphasis is on survival, survival,
survival, and the need for a “closely
knit” and “well-organised” society if
this (negative) end is to be achieved.
Just as Lee’s continual emphasis on
Singapore’s sovereignty has helped
bring about the ultimate foolishnesses
in Singapore-Malaysia relations, so
this stress on survival is likely to bring
about the very isolation which one
would have thought any Singapore gov-
ernment would wish to avoid.
As with the “assured markets” Singa-
pore expects from developed friends, so
in her relations with her developing
neighbors, the PAP assumption appears
to be that the world needs Singapore
more than Singapore needs the world.
Naturally, the way Indonesia, Malaysia,
and others view Singapore is colored by
their views, often hostile, on the Over-
seas Chinese.
In short, and paradoxically, when
Kuan Yew asserts that there are those
in the region who wish to see Singapore
destroyed he is, in fact, helping to make
sure that their numbers will grow.
Instead of creating a siege-like at-
mosphere, a “Fortress Singapore” men-
tality, Lee could be using his oft-
vaunted “brilliance” to push along the
incoming tide of regional co-operation.
Instead of creating more enemies, Lee
should be straining to co-operate with,
not survive against, his neighbors.

GENERAL MOSHE DAYAN gives
A Soldier’s Verdict
on Vietnam
This is the first of three reports on the Vietnam war as only
a professional soldier could see it. General Dayan has spent
five weeks in Vietnam observing the war at all levels, particularly
with the American troops among the jungles and elephant grass.
“TNOR you, mon general, all doors
J; are open. Just take care of
yourself, and for heaven’s sake
don’t pick one of my units to get killed
in.” We were at Pleiku, South Vietnam,
advancing headquarters of the United
States Ist Cavalry (Airmobile) Divi-
Sion Air Cavalry for short - whose
Norton nder 15 Major ‘ Genera John
‘ . . ~
General Norton took me in to din-
ner. With us was Colonel Brendswieg,
commanding 2nd Brigade, which was
soon to go into action. I would be with
them. I had just flown in by helicopter
from the Division’s rear headquarters,
which had given me a valuable view
of the terrain. Over the rear camp I
had seen the precious helicopters in the
centre; round them, the tents; then the
gun positions, 105 mm. and 155 mm.
Encircling them barbed-wire entangle-
ments, watchtowers, searchlights,
communications trenches, bunkers, and
beyond the barbed wire a firing area
stripped of tree and bush. And beyond
that, closing in from all directions,
the jungle, a thick, dark green density
of vegetation.
We flew over Route 19, memorable
from the French fighting here 12 years
ago. Just where the highway enters
the mountains more than 1000 French
troops were wiped out ip a Viet Minh
ambush. Even now, the Viet Cong deny
the orderly use of this route, mining
it, blowing up bridges, firing from the
jungle at passing traffic. Civilian
vehicles do not use it at all, and even
military convoys find it heavy going.
They are always led by tanks to
detonate the mines, and they have to
resort to improvised tracks to skiit
lh ' bl °"' n b ! ld S es ; Cunning Viet Cong
saboteurs often lay a 105 mm. shell
mine When ' tha , oe / off it takes care
of the tank, too.
The operation I had asked to join,
“Paul Revere,” was taking place in the
highland area near the Cambodian and
Laotian frontiers. In effect it was a
continuation of Operation Hastings,
the search for Viet Cong units in order
to engage them in combat,
American warfare in Vietnam is pri-
marily helicopter warfare. There are
altogether 1700 helicopters in the
country—more than there are in the
whole of Europe. The Ist Air Cavalry
Division is the organisational and
tactical expression of the imaginative
use of the helicopter in battle. It is
the American answer to the problem
of movement in the jungle,
Within four hours of the warning
order, an entire battalion with all its
equipment can be lifted to the com-
bat area and landed in the heart of the
jungle or on a mountain summit. At
this .moment, the division had 465 heli-
copters, but they complained they
hadn’t enough. To service them there
were 1500 mechanics, doing seven
hours’ maintenance for every flying
hour. The next morning there was no
let-up in the hard-driving rain, and the
Soldier, statesman, farmer, lawyer, and
amateur archaeologist, General
Dayan is one of the most dashing,
unorthodox, and colorful figures in
modern Israel. His military career
was capped by a four-year term as
Chief of the General Staff (1953-57).
He directed the Israeli forces in their
Sinai Desert campaign of 1956.
He went into politics on leaving the
Army and was Minister of Agriculture
from 1960 to 1964. (During the three
“slack” years from 1957 to 1960 he
managed to pick up a law degree at
Tel Aviv University.) Today he is
one of the leaders of the Opposition
in Israel’s Parliament.
Born in a pioneer farming village near
the Sea of Galilee (his father was a
member of the first kibbutz), he
joined the Haganah underground at
the age of 15. In 1939 he was caught
with a Haganah training group by
the British Mandatory authorities and
given a ten-year sentence.
When war broke out he and his com-
rades asked to be released to fight the
Nazis. Freed from Acre jail in 1941,
Dayan found himself a few weeks
later spearheading the Australian
troops in the invasion of Vichy Syria.
It was there, in the daring capture of
a fortress, that he lost an eye (and
almost his life).
Dayan - aerial reconnaissance in Ya
Drang Valley
clouds were so low they were almost
sitting on the treetops. But just before
noon it cleared slightly and H-hour was
set for 1300.
According to Norton’s information,
there was a Viet Cong division in this
highland area. It was not concentrated
in a single base but split into several
battalions, each of about 350 men. His
plan was to land a battalion from
Brendswieg’s brigade in the Viet Cong
divisional area and then, depending
on how the battle developed, to rush
in additional “reaction troops” to
reinforce, seal off, and carry out flank
attacks.
All very nice, but one element
seemed to be missing. No one knew
exactly where the Viet Cong battalions
were. Air photos and air reconnaissance
had failed to pick out their encamp-
ments. The American sources of intelli-
gence are mainly technical —air photos
and decoded radio intercepts. Infor-
mation gleaned from prisoners on their
jungle units is very scanty.
At 1305, D-Company, to which I
was attached, got the take-off signal.
The doors were removed and the
machine-gunners took up their ready-
to-fire positions. The helicopters rose
like a swarm of hornets and slid above
the tops of the trees. Each company flew
in a tight group of 16 craft and was
assigned its own landing-zone. When
we climbed higher, we heard the sal-
voes of the artillery engaged in
“clearance” shelling of the landing
areas.
The battle procedures of the Ist
Cavalry operated like an assembly-belt.
First came the shelling of the landing-


zones by ground artillery. Then came
aerial bombardment. And the landings
themselves were covered by “gun-
ships,” the accompanying, close-support
divisional (helicopter-borne) artillery,
firing their rockets and machine-guns
almost at our feet.
The landing-zone of our company
was a long, thin strip in the depth of
the jungle which at some time had been
cleared by Vietnamese farmers. Most
of it had since become overgrown with
elephant grass, but helicopters could
land. As we approached the strip,
smoke still rose from the shelling. De-
spite all the technical and psychological
preparations, we were all pretty tense.
Even before the helicraft touched down
we jumped and took quick cover in
the grass. Landing our company took
less than two minutes. The helicopters
whirred off. All round came sounds of
exploding shells and machine-gun fire.
I tried to poke my head out to discover
their source, but the grass was too high.
I climbed a slight rise nearby from
which I could see the terrain. The
forest was silent. The firing came from
the neighboring landing-zones which
were still being cleared. Our company
commander signalled the platoon com-
manders to take up battle positions.
The assembly-line of the Ist Cavalry’s
fighting machine continued at full
speed. Above the area of battalion HQ
flew heavy Chinook helicopters deposit-
ing 105 mm. guns. These were fol-
lowed by the giant Crane helicopters,
which cost more than $2 million each,
dangling heavy 155 mm. guns, bulldozers
- —and co.mmand communications cara-
vans. America, America!
But where was the war? It was like
watching military manoeuvres with
only one side taking part. Could they
operate in this way if the Viet Cong
also had warplanes, artillery, and
armor? The heaviest weapon in the •
Viet Cong unit is one that can be
carried on a man’s back—a medium
mortar. But, anyway, where were the
Viet Cong? The "Viet Cong were there
—a few hundred yards away. And the
battle came half an hour later.
I transferred from D-Company to
battalion HQ, where I found General
Norton, Colonel Brendswieg, and Gen-
eral Walker, the commander of the
neighboring 25th Division, part of
whose formation was attached to Ist
Cavalry. They were bent over maps
spread out on the grass.
The commander of the company
which had landed 300 yards south of
my copapany had decided to advance
to a hill on the other side of a stream.
The unit moved off in single file across
the narrow path leading to the stream,
one platoon after the other. Even
though the scouts proceeded with great
caution, stopping every so often to
listen, they failed to detect the Viet
Cong until they found themselves under
fire.
The Viet Cong battalion positions
were dug in a little way from the path,
Airlifting American supplies - the airborne war
and were covered by branches on
which rested the dug-up earth with its
grass. The Viet Cong let the first
American section through, and then
opened up with all their machine-guns
and rifles on the platoons along the
path. Within minutes, the company was
put out of action, sustaining more than
70 casualties, of whom 26 were Tilled
and about 50 wounded. The company
commander was among the wounded;
his second in command was killed
when a bullet hit and detonated the
grenade at his belt.
By radio the firing officer requested
reinforcements and the shelling and
bombing of the Viet Cong positions.
Battalion co,mmand informed him that
a company would be landed to help
remove the wounded and dead, but
there would be no assault. The Ameri-
cans carry out their counter-attacks
and pursuit in the jungle not with
infantry but by firepower. The artillery
and air force are summoned to bom-
bard an area as soon as it is shown to
be holding enemy troops—even if these
be few or even turn out to be a lone
sniper.
The problem faced by an American
infantry unit in engaging the Viet Cong
is to discover where they are, so storm-
ing and assault are done by shells of
the 155 s and by aerial bombs. The
most effective weapons the Americans
have for this function are the heavy
high-flying 852 bombers. Their bomb-
ing, directed electronically, is accurate
and destructive and they can operate
no matter what the weather or visi-
bility.
Clashes between American forces and
Viet Cong units, like that which
occurred this afternoon, would seem, on
the face of it, to be accidental. They
are not. Most of the U.S.-Viet Cong
engagements start out this way, and
this is the joint product of Viet Cong
tactics and American strategy. The
Viet Cong tactic is to attack American
units with the aim of destroying them
when the prospect of success seems
bright. Even in the incident I saw, if
the Viet Cong unit had wished to evade
battle it could have done so. Ninety
out of every 100 battles in the Vietnam
war begin, as this one did, on Viet
Cong initiative, when they deem the-
' circumstances favorable.
The American forces, too, have as
their aim “destruction of the enemy”;
but they do not make its execution
conditional on a “favorable tactical
situation.” The American commanders
are eager to make contact with the
Viet Cong at all times, in any situa-
tion and at any price. They are not put
off by the possibility that at the first
contact the Viet Cong may have the
upper hand. They are convinced that
as the clash develops they will come
out on top. Their main problem is to
shake out the Viet Cong from their
hiding-places, and if American patrols
serve as bait to secure this, that suits
them. For the Americans, coming under
fire is not the climax of the battle. It
is just the opening, to be quickly fol-
lowed by bringing into action the full
might of their artillery and aircraft,
thereby smothering 'the initial advan-
tage of the Viet Cong troops, equipped
only with personal weapons.
The aggressiveness of American fight-
ing in Vietnam stems not only from
the character of the American Army.
Its source lies in policy, in strategy, in
the way in which those who determine
the military steps of the United States
hope to achieve victory.
To hear about American strategy in
Vietnam, I had flown to Saigon via
Washington. I put the question to
General Maxwell Taylor when I met
him at the White House, and I also
raised it with the Secretary of Defence,
Mr. McNamara. Put at its simplest and
baldest, Washington sees the key to
victory in the breaking of Hanoi’s
fighting spirit. This can be secured
by keeping up the heavy bombing of
North Vietnam and wiping out the
Viet Cong units in the south. Washing-
ton estimates that American forces are
killing North Vietnamese troops at the
rate of more than 1000 a week.
Mr. McNamara and General Taylor
believe that if this American military
activity,is maintained and strengthened,
Ho Chi Minh will not be able to with-
stand it for long. He will be forced
to end hostilities and accept the Ameri-
can demand to sit down with them at
the negotiating table. The American

trate every likely area in every way in
an effort to expose Viet Cong units
and wipe them out. Search and des-
troy —■ that is the policy, and it well
matches the aggressive character of
the A,merican commanders.
At 1730 we left battalion HQ. Mon-
soon clouds again began to blanket
the skies. Norton invited me to join
him in the flight to General Walker’s
HQ for dinner and the continued re-
view of the operation. As we flew I
noticed large clearings in the jungle,
which turned out to be extensive tea
plantations. Such careful cultivation
was in stark contrast to the wild and
primitive vegetation all around.
The plantations are old. Their
owners, French and Chinese, continue
to tend them in the midst of what has
been a battle-zone for the past 20
years. Co-existence is apparently pos-
sible even in war. Neither the Govern-
ment troops nor the Viet Cong inter-
fere with the plantations, their laborers
or their installations. Tea prices are
high, labor is cheap, and profits are
ample enough to cover taxes and bribes
to the Government and ransom to the
Viet Cong. “Tea for two . .
General Walker’s advance Divisional
HQ looks like a field unit. Two tents
serve as the officers’ mess; plates are
standard field issue; and the food, apart
from cans of beer, is the same as that
which I ate with the troops.
General Norton, as commander of
Operation Paul Revere, took charge of
the operational review. The question
was whether the Viet Cong would ex-
ploit the hours of darkness and the
early-morning monsoon rains and poor
visibility to withdraw, and if so how
could they be stopped. They are ex-
pert at moving through the jungle.
They split their units into small groups
of not more than 15 men and each
takes a different jungle path to reach
the new rendezvous.
Walker thinks they will try to with-
draw to Cambodia during the
night. The Viet Cong negotiate the
jungle at night, but the Americans do
not. The Cambodian frontier is less
than ten miles away.
Norton is not so sure. He thinks they

have stocks of ammunition and rice in
the area, and perhaps also an under-
ground hospital, and that they need
time to shift them. Moreover, they
have put enormous effort into concen-
trating their forces in this zone; their
men marched for more than three
months from North Vietnam to get
here, and they" are unlikely now to
make a hurried retreat to Cambodia.
With the discussions over, and steps
apparently taken to deal with the Viet
Cong in the area, I did not have the
feeling that Operation Paul Revere
was achieving its objective. The Ist
Cavalry, plus units from the 25th
Division, had concentrated their might
to destroy the Viet Cong force. What
the Americans had at their disposal
was all that a co.mmander could visua-
lise in a dream; helicopters to rush his
men to any location, well-trained,
aggressive troops ready for action, air
and artillery support, equipment, am-
munition, and fuel in virtually un-
limited supply. Yet with all this they
had not succeeded in routing the Viet
Cong. More than this: they had not
succeeded in bringing them to decisive
battle. They do not always know where
the Viet Cong units are; and when
they do run across them —usually when
this suits the Viet Cong—after the
initial encounter, the enemy slips from
their grasp.
I said to Norton that the Air
Cavalry are the perfect (though ex-
pensive) answer to the problem of
mobility in the jungle. But there is
one thing they seem unable to do
land their units quietly, secretly, with-
out detection. The helicopters announce
themselves every inch of the way. The
Viet Cong, on the other hand, may take
three months to walk from the north,
but they do not give themselves away.
Norton listened attentively. When I
had finished, he fixed me with his eyes
and said in jesting tone —but he meant
it: “Don’t worry, mon general, we’ll
get them!”
Early next morning a signal came in
from Ist Cavalry HQ to say that there
had been a heavy Viet Cong attack
on a Korean defensive position under
Ist Cavalry command close to where
I now was, Plei Me, and General Nor-
ton thought I might like to get there
fast while the signs of battle were still
fresh. A Special Forces jeep drove me
to the scene.
J)URING the night this defensive
position, manned by a company of
Koreans about 130 strong, had been
attacked by a Viet Cong regiment of
three battalions totalling more than
1000 men. The attack had failed, and
the regiment knocked out of action. On
the battlefield they had left 237 killed,
and it was reasonable to assume they
had suffered double that number in
wounded who had probably been car-
ried off to nearby Cambodia. The
American losses had been two killed
and eight wounded.
The Korean company had arrived
six days earlier and had had enough
time to dig themselves in. As I was
able to see, they had done it with care
and skill. Every defence post was over-
hung with slats bearing a thiok layer
of grassed earth, and all were linked
by deep, narrow trenches. The entire
position was ringed with concertina
wire sown with mines and illumination
shells.
The main attack had been launched
on the western defences. The distance
from the barbed wire there to the
edge of the jungle was just under 200
yards, and was covered with tall grass.
The Viet Cong commander apparently
assumed that he could reach the fence
on this sector without being exposed,
and it was here that he concentrated
his assault force, and against these wes-
tern emplacements that he directed
his deterrent fire machine-gun and
mortar. It appeared that Viet Cong
patrols had reconnoitred the defence
position and noted the Korean firing-
posts despite their camouflage.
The fatal mistake of the Viet Cong
commander was to think only of the
Korean company, which he could see,
With U.S. Marines at Cham Lo
and not of the artillery, aircraft, and
tanks which would be summoned to
its support. There is a primitive and
leaden logic to warfare; in an open
engagement between two unequal
forces,’ the strong defeats the weak.
The victories of the Davids over* the
Goliaths are rare indeed in the king-
dom of tanks and guns.
What happened to the Viet Cong
soon after their attack was that along
the 200-yard-wide strip between jungle
and fence the American support units
laid down no less than 21,000 shells
more than the total volume of artillery
fire expended by the Israeli Army dur-
ing the Sinai Campaign and War of
Independence together!
The wonder was not that the Viet
Cong failed to capture the position but
that a few managed to reach the fence
and even lob hand-grenades within.
As I walked through the devastated
battlefield, I was struck by the extreme
youth of the Viet Cong dead. Viet-
namese males in general have young
faces, but these looked particularly
youthful. Perhaps it was the pallor of
death. Most of them were without tin
helmets. Some wore sandals, some were
barefoot, possibly having lost their
sandals while rushing to the assault.
Despite their poor clothing and the
murky puddles in which they lay—the
rain was unceasing—they looked quite
smart and clean. I got the impression
somehow that in preparation for the
attack they had paid careful attention,
to their appearance haircut, shave,
change of uniform.
The weapons they bore were oF
varied types. They were Mausers from..
World War'll, semi-automatic rifles of
Soviet design and Chinese make, light
machine-guns with 30-round arc maga-
zines, and even a few medium machine-
guns which I think were Czech MG 345,
Deeper in the jungle were their sup-
port mortars and their knapsacks,
which they had removed before going-
off to the attack. I took one of the
knapsacks. In it were a spare uniform
and a nylon bag containing 750
grammes of rice, a packet of salt, a
cooking pot, and a spoon. The spooa
was clearly an improvisation by its
owner, hand-beaten out of a piece of
aluminium. In a side pocket of the kit-
bag was a packet of small personal
items. Carefully wrapped in a water-
proof strip of cloth were a lighter, ink
powder, and a bronze pin bearing a re-
lief of Ho Chi Minh.
The path to the Viet Cong mortar
position continued into the heart of
the jungle, but we did not pursue it.
The company commander who"
with me estimated that Viet Cong-
survivors moving through the jungle
must have suffered further casualties
from air bombing. During the night
and early morning, 852 bombers plas-
tered a nine-square-mile area along the;
Cambodian border to hit the retreating
remnants of the Viet Cong regiment.
I do not know if General Giap, the
Viet Cong military chief, and Ho Chi
Minh are thoroughly aware of what
goes on at the fighting fronts, and
whether storming American-defended
positions with the aim of capturing
them follows a High Command order
or is undertaken at the initiative of
the local commander. At all events,
the assumption that the American
Army can be vanquished in the same
way as the French were defeated by the
Viet Minh in 4954 is utterly baseless.
Any attempt to achieve an American
edition of Dien Bien Phu dooms
Hanoi’s troops to annihilation.

A Year After Vatican II
Breathing new life into Catholicism
By PETER GOUGH
YOU and I were to witness,” said
Cardinal Gilroy, in an address to
Knights of the Southern Cross,
“the greatest religious event of all times,
because there never was a Council com-
parable to this.”
In terms of time, a year has elapsed
since a Te Deum was intoned to pull
down the curtain on Vatican 11. The
bishops have long bid their farewells
of Pope Paul and the many splendors
that are Rome, and returned to their
Sees in New York, Paris, Darwin, Syd-
ney, Port Moresby, and a thousand
other places.
The bishops have not returned, des-
pite the fond hopes of some, to a
business-as-usual Catholicism. Vatican
II has erected high barriers against a
return to former ways that knew neither
free-speech nor articulate dissent.
This is the new Catholicism that con-
fronts the Australian bishops. It bears
small resemblance to that other Church
of pre-conciliar days. A restlessness has
been brought to bear both within and
without the sanctuary. There is the
scent of challenge that appeals, on the
one hand, to the young-of-heart, but
it is a nagging irritant, on the other
hand, to those Catholics who cast their
lives and faith in a static mould.
First, and above all, Vatican II
placed a direct challenge at the feet
of the bishops. In convening the Coun-
cil, Pope John made public recognition
of the need to up-date the Church. The
ready magnitude of support for John’s
Council left no bishop immune from
the spirit of renewal in his diocese. Re-
newal in a diocese does not necessarily
mean, however, a swift change of heart
in the bishop.
Bishops have a habit of being men
of most senior years. The bishop of ripe,
old age has long been a feature of
Australian Catholicism. Archbishop
Mannix lived and retained office to all
but a few months of. his hundredth
birthday. While, in Brisbane, Archbishop
Sir James Duhig still held the See
at the time of his death in his mid-90s.
The aged, and bishops are no ex-
ception, take unkindly to change. In
a slow-moving world, the Church
moved slowly, and almost got away
with it. But in today’s high-speed world,
Catholicism can no longer afford the
luxury of a static posture. Rumblings
among Catholic cognoscenti seem to
favor making room at the top for a
younger brand of bishop.
Retirement at seventy-five for bishops
and parish priests stems down from tbe
Council. Time alone will relate how
this works in practice. At the present
time, the truth of the matter is that
the Catholic Church lacks the mechanics
for the proper retirement of parish
priests and bishops.
Here is a question, naturally enough,
of deep concern to junior priests and
auxiliary bishops, and laymen, for that
matter, schooled in the ways of Vatican
II Catholicism. The mere notion of re-
tirement for bishops and parish priests
strikes a sturdy blow at the heart of
the Catholic establishment. But those
Catholics who favor the retirement of
aged clerics care, in fact, little for the
establishment. A cosy clericalism is
hardly, in their view, the road that
leads to aggiornamento.
In an assessment of work accom-
plished by the Australian bishops at
Vatican 11, Archbishop Guilford Young
of Hobart emerged
as top performer.
This is the back-
ground to a current
prediction that
Archbishop Young
is listed for trans-
lation to either
Canberra or Mel-
bourne.
A notable decline
in health has forced
Archbishop Justin
Simonds to appoint
Bishop Arthur Fox
administrator of the
Melbourne diocese.
For Arthur Fox it
was a return to an
old job, since he
did the same duties
under Archbishop
Mannix. No sug-
gestion is made that
Bishop Fox will be
the next Archbishop
of Melbourne. In
the episcopal ploys,
Arthur Fox is al-
ways the bridesmaid
but never the bride.
Today, among in-
formed Catholics,
the matter of elec-
tion and appoint-
ment of bishops
causes many a
heartburn. Priests
are the main critics
of the current man-
ner of episcopal appointments. By way
of a first reform, the critics suggest,
bishops should be appointed on a vote
from the clergy.
Vatican II has certainly made deep
inroads into the lives of Catholic
priests. The pre-conciliar definitive
mould of the priesthood has bowed be-
fore a more flexible, sacerdotal image in
the post-conciliar Church. A dramatic
awareness that things are not what they
used to be has become a major trauma
for most priests.
Priests have registered a noticeable
dip on the social barometer. Gone are
the days of Father Knows Best. Afflu-
ence and tertiary education among the
laity have seen to that. But the post-
conciliar challenge to priests rests much
nearer the heart of the priesthood than
a loss in social rating or the intellectual
superiority of laymen.
First, many priests are experiencing,
and for the first time in their lives, a
sense of theological inadequacy.
Secondly, the current uncertainties in
the Church gnaw incessantly at the pro-
fessional integrity of priests.
Prior to the Council most seminaries
taught a brand of philosophy and
theology that was better suited to
angels than to men. The deep, human
involvements that are the lot of man
living in a world of sweat and tears
were cast aside before the angelic nice-
ties of scholastic definitions.
It is a little late in the day for most
priests to remedy the problem, but an
Cardinal Gilroy... shattering old customs.
awareness has come to them that their
seminary studies were, intellectually
and professionally, of small merit.
Complaints are constant about the
quality of Sunday sermons. Among
better-educated Catholics, a current in-
game is to display impatience with the
pulpit performance. The Documents
of Vatican II place special emphasis
on the need for effective preaching. A
theological breakdown in communica-
tions between priests and people en-
genders a high obstacle that trips up
many a sermon. The lack of dialogue
between pulpit and pews, according to a

Sydney priest, sounds the death-knell
for the traditional Sunday sermon.
Religious brothers and nuns have
not escaped the scrutiny of Catholic
critics. A criticism is being sounded
that nuns and brothers move inward
rather than outward in their religious
activities. (Although for the opposite
view see Bulletin Letters, Oct. 29.) The
constitutions of the Order or Congre-
gation take precedence over the mis-
sion of the Church. Brothers and nuns,
the criticism continues, live outside the
day-to-day experiences of adults. In
such circumstances, it is easy to appre-
ciate the anxieties of a growing number
of nuns and brothers in their religious
vocations.
Although Vatican II has brought into
play new perspectives for bishops,
priests, and religious, nevertheless, it is
the laity, above all, who place major
claim on the Council. In the jargon of
the moment: Vatican II sparked off the
emergence of the layman.

proclaim, of pray, pay, and blindly
obey. Today the Church is in that new
world, they continue, of no taxation
without representation. Catholicism is
far too important, the more daring
smirk, to be left in the hands of bishops
and priests.
In simple words, the layman seeks
an adult role in the life of the Church
The request is ordinary, the laity main-
tain, since adulthood for the layman
is a daily experience. A layman is an
adult in his home, at his job, in the
affairs of the neighborhood, and in
the political business of the country.
Frustration and anger multiply when
adult life is the happy lot of the lay-
man in all things but membership of the
Church. Religion becomes an outlet for
his tensions; anti-clericalism forms the
shape of his religious utterances. Vati-
can II conjures up a wonderland of
opportunity in the mind of the layman;
he determines that neither bishop nor
priest will blackball his entry into the
adult ranks of the Church.
The Church in the world is a con-
glomeration of bishops, priests, religious
orders, and laity. Rights and duties are
common to layman and bishop. “Who
are the laity?” a bishop queried of
John Henry Newman. “We. should look
rather foolish without them,” Newman
was tempted to retort. The laity have
the numbers and control the purse-
strings; points worthy of earnest medi-
tation for bishops and senior clergy in
the post-conciliar Church.
Time, in the preciseness of the schol-
astics, is the measurement of change.
Despite the tears of Catholic conserva-
tives, the Church wears the garb of
time; ergo the Church is subject to
change. Be that as it may, the cult of
change was given small breathing space
in the life of the modern Church prior
to John sitting in Peter’s chair.
Before the days of Vatican 11, Irish
and Australian Catholicism were inter-
changeable terms. The conservatism of
Irish Catholicism became a mark of
the Church in this country; Irishness
was the touchstone of orthodoxy for
Australian Catholics.
Religion was couched in a catechism
of blacks and whites. A good Catholic
was motional rather than notional in
matters of faith: he went to Mass;
munched his fish on Fridays; sent his
children to Catholic schools. It was a
sleepy Catholicism that awoke with a
jolt at the thrusts of Vatican 11.
The Council at Rome was primarily
a theological engagement. For Austra-
lian Catholics, and most of their
bishops, this was something foreign.
Theological speculation was a thing of
the Germans and Dutch, but the Irish
legacy was a different breed. While
German and Dutch theologians con-
demned the Star Chamber techniques
of the then Holy Office; the Irish
fulminated against contraceptives. Vati-
can II called for a sense of values from
bishops; the post-conciliar Church issues
a like demand.
Current dissensions among Austra-
lian Catholics spring largely over a
priority of values. It is no skirmish. The
roots of conflict are deep and bitter;
the end result is full of far-reaching
possibilities. An extraordinary feature
of the present troubles within the
Church is the unawareness of most
a witness to a static view of history in
the minds of Church authorities. Fur-
ther to the woes of the bishops, lather
Julian Miller, a member of the faculty
at St. Patrick’s College, Manly, N.S'.W.,
deplores the fact that religious educa-
tion stops for the majority of Catho'lics
after the age of 15.
By way of rallying support for epi-
scopal policy, Bishop Arthur Fox sai’d
that the critics should remain silent 1 :.
However, Cistercian silence, as every"
schoolboy knows, is not a holy sign
among critics. Dialogue rather than
silence would seem to be a post-
conciliar virtue.
A Chapter of Faults is 1 part of the
new Catholic image. The “Catholic
Worker” chides the clergy' for silence
on Vietnam „ and conscription. Parish
priests, bemoans a young curate, are
bookkeepers and counters of coins. The
schools must go, says a De La Salle
brother, in order to put religion back
into the lives of Catholics. TThe Coun-
cil, fumes an 80-year-old monsignor, is
the kiss of death for the Church.
Vatican 11, claim the critics*, was no
Jiarbinger of death. Pope John had
shuddered at the darkness th.at filled
many places in the Church. Fo>r John,
then, the mission of the Council was to
bring light into the life of the Ohurch.
“Silence is not a sign of holiness ”
Catholics of the circumstances that sur-
round the conflicts.
Domestic bickering has been, for
more than a decade, the curse of Aus-
tralian Catholicism. The unmasking
of Mr. B. A. Santamaria’s “Movement”
struck a decisive blow at Catholic unity;
a personality cult cracked open the face
of the Church. For Catholics, the clas-
sic demands of Christ or Caesar were to
give way to expressions of loyalty to
Gilroy or Mannix. The affair offered
little in the manner of theological
sophistication, but it proved a major
contribution in the ways of Tammany
Hall politics, ft blunted the perceptive-
ness of many Catholics to the very
fundamentals of the Council.
Despite the aspirations of Vatican
II for theological renewal among adults,
the education of children in Catholic
schools swamps, by far, all other works
of the Church in Australia. The schools
have lost favor, in recent years, with
a growing number of Catholics. Church
authorities opt for childish priorities, a
brand of criticism runs, since current
policy lavishes 80 percent of the labor
and financial resources of the Church
upon the untroubled lives of school-
children.
Spokesmen for the schools are unable
to keep the critics at bay. A former
Director of Education in the Arch-
diocese of Canberra and Goulburn,
Father John P. Kelly, maintains that
the schools hinder the proper imple-
mentation of Vatican II directives.
Father Brian Crittenden, a Sydney edu-
cationist, claims that the schools are
By any fair assessment, the Coun’cil

lights that have filtered back to the
Church in Australia,
In a warm response to the mind oi
the Council, Cardinal Gilroy shattered
old customs by attending St. Andrew’s
Cathedral, Sydney, for the enthrone-
ment of Archbishop Marcus Loane.
Here was ready evidence that ecu-
menism existed beyond the scholarly
confines of theologians and the ways of
fringe Catholics; while the event made
commonsense to the man-in-the-street,
Christians in the pews knew that they
were living in better times, and were
thankful for their good fortune,
A conviviality with other Christians
is now part of the Catholic experience.
Bishop Thomas Muldooni, Auxiliary to
Cardinal Gilroy, is feted in the columns
of Sydney’s “Anglican.” 'The rector of

Catholic observer from Australia at
Vatican 11, is much soujght-after. for

Americans and Australians were given
burdens that escaped those in Catholic
countries.
No Catholic, in the full spring of life,
wants to return to that “ghetto” of
other days. The paternalist garb of
an inward-bound Church projects a
lack-lustre image to Australian Catho-
lics who have long departed the eco-
nomic, social, and intellectual environs
of their Irish forebears.
Post-conciliar Catholics shun the
limitations of an eschatological theology
the notorious hell-sermons of the
Redemptorists that shows a cold
heart for the lives of men. In the mind
of the articulate Catholic, the Christo-
centric concepts of a Bonhoeffer
broaden considerably the horizons of
religious commitment. Vietnam rather
than impure thoughts becomes the sub-
ject matter of today’s dark night of
the soul. “A little Bonhoeffer,” claims
a priest scholar, “goes a long way.”
In a recent address at the Anglican
Moore Theological College, Sydney,
Allan Ashbolt tabulated the sad efforts
of the Churches in the problem fields
of war and poverty. Mr. Ashbolt bit
deeply into the Christian conscience.
Despite the pleas of Mr. Ashbolt, pov-
erty and war make small news along-
side State Aid in the Catholic Press of
this country.
IT is, in a fashion, a confrontation
over priorities. The new breed dia-
logue on war and poverty; the tradi-
tionalists vocalise the case for State Aid.
No easy solution faces the contestants.
In the present structure of the Catholic
Church, it is a power game mixed with
politics rather than an ideological con-
test. The disturbing state of parish
finances brought about by the schools,
according to a parish priest, might well
decide the fate of the debate. “It will
be small consolation,” says a critic of
the schools, “to tell the bishops that we
told them so.”
Today a new generation of Catholics
seeks a more robust secular commitment
in the life of the Church. The ranks
should open, the argument runs, for
dialogue within the Church. The
Church of Silence is not behind the
Iron Curtain, a priest complains, it is
right here in Australia. Apparently the
sub secreto mentality dies hard with
certain prelates, despite the “Open
Church” idealism of Vatican 11. A
man must be both free to listen and to
speak; otherwise he is marginal to the
mainstream of life. In like manner,
the Church functions on the outskirts
if the great human issues permit neither
assent nor dissent among members.
Evidence abounds that the wake for
the old parish structure is ready for
celebration. In these days, the original
social and religious knot of the Irish
in Australia, on which the parish was
cast and with minor adaptations still
operates, bears small relevance upon
the lives of parishioners. For the major-
ity, the 45 minutes at Sunday Mass is
the sole function of the parish. In
many ways, the moribund existence of
the suburban cinema and the huge
parish plant tell the same story. It is
the impact of history upon the lives of
men. By way of outlet, the Church must
seek ways and means that uphold the
integrity of mission, and yet still spon-
sor existential relevance in parish life.
In the values of Vatican 11, religion
and life form a complement that orien-
tates the manifold endeavors of man
experiencing a span of life. For Catho-
lics, despite the prophets of doom,
there is no fundamental dichotomy be-
tween religion and life, since both
spring, in the Catholic view, from the
same creative being. Here is a guide-
line that stimulates the articulation of
progressives, and gives them hope for
favorable decisions in the birth-control
debate, clerical celibacy, and new hori-
zons for women in the Church.
Recent events testify a failure among
Catholics to draw sharp distinctions be-
tween principles and policy. In a logical
process, principles form the structure
along which policy takes shape; untold
harm results in the Church when policy

overrides principles. The current, un-
tidy policies of the Catholic Establish-
ment that dominate the schools debate,
the Pill discussions, conscription and
Vietnam, and clerical celibacy would
achieve better perspective if prelates
and spokesmen were to communicate
the principles at issue rather than boost,
at the expense of the principles, per-
sonal policies.
Despite the news-wise success of the
Council, the Catholic Press in Australia
has, and with justification, trepidations
about its future. The diocesan look of
most Catholic papers registers small
appeal with new-look Catholics. A
generation of Vatican II Catholics re-
jects the news value of bishops photo-
graphed in full pontificials blessing
school walls. A few bright spots pacify
the critics: Father Michael Costigan,
the associate editor of Melbourne’s
“ Advocate,” wins praise with an excel-
lent Council coverage: in the “Catholic
Worker,” Niall Brennan (according to
New York novelist and critic, Wilfrid
Sheed, a place must be found for Mr.
Brennan in Catholic journalism), gives
a Hemingway robustness to matters that
were once the private concern of aca-
demic theologians: a young priest,
Father P. R. Wilkinson, editor of Ade-
laide’s “Southern Cross,” claims Pope
Paul adopts a dove-stance on Vietnam,
Mr. Santamaria objects but Father
Wilkinson produces additional Pauline
peace utterances.
On the campus at the University of
New South Wales, conservative and
progressive Catholics strike pro-and-con
blows over the secretive and Spanish-
born Opus Dei. The instant religion of
the Cursillo, a near relative of Opus
Dei, makes Vatican II Catholics
jocosely query if the Council were really
necessary. Apart from reciting the same
creed, progressive and conservative
Catholics share little else in common,
Although Catholic upheavals have
been a feature of Australian life for
over a decade; only a smudging of the
surface has been captured by creative
writers. The cinemascopic Catholic
horizons of Morris West function in
Rome and Saigon, but never in Syd-
ney or Melbourne. The task would
seem to rest with Thomas Keneally. No
alternative offers other than for Mr.
Keneally to sit down and write the
great Australian Catholic novel,
Multiple signs indicate a stormy sea-
son ahead for the Church in Australia.
Bishop John Cullinane manifests irri-
tation with Cardinal Gilroy’s State Aid
plans. The black-and-white, theological
polemics of Dr. Rumble seem a thous-
and syllogisms distant from the Teil-
hardian visions of a young Melbourne
Jesuit, Father John Cowburn. Mr.
Santamaria remains loyal to pre-
conciliar theology, and supports the
holy war against Communism; Dr.
Max Charlesworth is post-conciliar in
his theological expressions, and favors
dialogue with Communists. In the past,
the dreaded word heretic would have
been sounded, fortunately Catholics
now hve in better times,
In manner of summary, the new spirit
of Catholicism is seen best through non-
Roman eyes: They sa y Rome
never changes, said the Anglican
Bishop of Bathurst, Rt. Rev. E. K.
Leslie, after attending a Catholic cere-
mony, “but it was a pleasure to go
there to hear you (Catholics) praying
like Anglicans and singing like Metho-
dists.” And by way of finality, who’s for
aggiornamento?


ONE MORE
WEEK
Bad example
FOLLOWING the debate on Sydney’s
Channel 7 on the British bishops’ “Sex
and Morality” report, one of the
students who took part, David Taylor,
26, wrote a lengthy piece in the Sydney
“Sun” pointing out that although he
and the other student taking part, Miss
Jacqueline Einstein, had come out in
favor of premarital sexual relations,
this “did not necessarily reflect the lives
either of us lead.” This sounds to us
like the time-honored attitude of public
arbiters of private morals—“ Don’t do as
I do, do as I say.”
Welterweight
IN THE OLD Cinecraft studios _at
Rushcutters Bay, Sydney, where Tompiy
Burns once learned his lines for his
part in “The Sons of Matthew,” an-
other welterweight-turned-actor, Mark
McManus, is doing rather better.
Among the props and ghosts of our
vanished film industry he has been re-
hearsing for the Phillip Theatre’s pro-
duction of “Luv,” in which he plays the
40-year-old greatly disillusioned Harry
Berlin.
Far from 40 and far from disillu-
sioned, McManus is gleeful that he has
been in work for three years. “Well this
is marvellous,” he said. “There are
literally hundreds of actors in Sydney,
and to keep working, with money every
week for that long you know it’s
fantastic.”
Originally from Scotland, he had to
take voice lessons to get rid of his
accent, but since he first went to audi-
tion in amateur groups to “find friends”
he has played at the New Theatre and
in “Becket,” toured with the Young
Elizabethans, appeared at the Adelaide
Festival, worked for the Phillip, and
once turned down a part offered by
the Elizabethan Trust because he
thought he wasn’t ready to tackle it.
He has acted in radio and was awarded
the Best Television Performance prize
for his role in ABN’s “Ballad For One
Gun” in 1964. Most recently he played
Romeo on the North Shore.
In fact, for a young man who claims
he was a professional agitator before
he came to Sydney, he has done very
well. “I just drifted over here rest-
lessly,” he said. “Before that I was
always carrying placards demanding
nuclear disarmament or trudging off
to Aldermaston. I drifted into fighting
in the same way. I started off in a boys’
club and eventually was runner-up for
the Melbourne Olympics. But I wasn’t
really good enough.” He is glad that he
tried boxing, because it taught him to
move well though not well enough
to escape the broken nose which pre-
vents him from having a Barrymore
profile.
Involvement
A HIGHLY unlikely candidate to be
author of a book on Vietnam, pretty
21-year-old Susan Terry was in
Sydney last week to publicise her
“House of Love” for Lansdowne Press.
Not, as might be thought, a treatise on
sex, the book is about Susan’s year with
an Australian surgical team working as
part of a U.S.-instigated program to
help civilians.
Treating all comers, the hospital
seems to have been a haven for Viet
Cong and South Vietnamese alike,
which was probably a measure of safety
for the staff.
Young Sister Terry, fired with the
spirit of adventure and going off to war
like Florence Nightingale, soon found
herself as confused as anyone else in
Vietnam. Out for dinner in Saigon she
would watch the distant gunfire from
someone’s rooftop, rather as one
watches the moon, and would have to
remind herself that she would be in-
volved with the results on the following,
day.
For Art's Sake
AUSTRALIANS may see more
modern American art now that Lewis
Lederer has taken up his appointment
as director of the United States In-
formation Service. Relaxing in his office
after the rush of the Johnson visit (Mr.
Lederer was here only two days when
the President arrived), Mr. Lederer said
an exhibition of modern art from the
United States could be brought here
if enough interest were shown.
Although the James Michener col-
lection was shown at the last Adelaide
Festival, local artists often complain
that they do not have access to a wide
enough variety of modern American
art. However, American attention on
Australia because of the Johnson visit
may induce officials in Washington to
include Australia in the USIS’s circuit
of travelling art shows.
But even if no show from abroad
can be arranged, American paintings
may still go on display here. Mr.
Lederer is an abstract painter who
hopes to take part in group shows during
his three-year tour of duty.
Although he has held one-man shows
in the United States, Indonesia, and
Iran, Mr. Lederer doubts that a one-
man show be possible here. “There are
two problems —time to paint and a
place to paint,” he said. As director
of a busy USIS office and a flat dweller
without a studio, he has little of either.
A native of Kentucky, the 61-year-old
American was reared in Ohio and re-
ceived most of his formal art training
at the Art Academy of Cincinnati.
Music has been the USIS director’s
other main interest since the days when
he was a 15-year-old jazz pianist in
Cincinnati. He had a band and his own
weekly radio programme on station
WLW, then the most powerful station
in the world. “I toured different parts
of the United States in the Big Band
era, playing the piano and handling my
own publicity. This led me into adver-
tising and public relations.”
Squaring the Circle
NO SHOPPING CENTRE is opened
these days without a publicity release
comparing the new venture with the
medieval town or village square. But
one would not have to be widely
travelled to know that these earlier
squares generally drew their inspiration
from Church or State and not merely
Mammon.
Still, there is no reason why shopping
centres should not have some life about
them, no matter how contrived.
Sydney’s Australia Square began quite
austerely when the smaller, rectangular
building, looking like something stark
out of a German film of the ’thirties,
was finished about a year ago. But
within days a spark of life came with a
friendly woman selling tickets in a

course behind her.
With the opening of the ground-floor
shops in the circular tower building,
the project has gone on to greater
things. The Italian Festival was opened
recently on the parade-ground between
the two buildings. Young ladies danced
the tarantella for lunch-munching
crowds and the cream of local Italian
society, all buttonholed with carnations,
Italy’s national flower.
While the tarantellas were going on,
Civil and Civic’s project manager, Chris
Regan, helmeted and harried, was
trying to keep up the schedule of one
floor a week and supervising the day’s
pour. Through the core of the building-
wet concrete was being lifted to the
scheduled floor. A climbing hoist system
is used which fits with slide-rule
accuracy in one of the building’s
elevator shafts and is raised as each
floor is added. This concrete is off-
loaded in George Street and fed down
into trucks running along a tiny under-
ground railway (the only one to cross
from George Street to Pitt). This brings
concrete to the hoist in one-shot loads
at the rate of 30 cu. yards an hour. In
fact, 300 men were milling around in
the working part of the tower while
the speeches were being made and the
band was playing downstairs.
This rather paradoxical way of pro-
ducing a building without any apparent
sign of activity is fascinating Sydney
as floor after floor rises almost
spontaneously from the plaza. The
secret is partly contained in prefabrica-
tion and in the fact that it is a light
concrete structure. It will be the tallest
lightweight concrete building in the
world, but it is claimed that it can
withstand the force of winds up to 135
miles per hour. Its columns and span-
drels are all pre-cast and only these
and the steel girders have to be lifted
on the outside of the building.
By June, 1967, 14 floors will be occu-
pied. How offices were to be fitted into
the circular shape gave prospective
tenants some qualms, but the manage-
ment quickly decorated a group of pos-
sible offices and a conference room.
The curved partitions looked very inter-
esting and the wide expanse of double-
window area, fitted with near-invisible
Venetian blinds within the window for
uniformity, gives an airy feeling to
this tower, which will eventually rise
95 feet above the State office block.
Both buildings are giving trouble to
aircraft flying over Sydney, as they in-
terfere with existing radar installations.
The interior of the tower is designed
on a five-foot module, and partitions
must follow the provisions made for
them in the basic structure. This will
give uniformity within the building and
prevent wholesale partitioning.
The possible problem of fitting square
furniture into a round building does not
arise, since two walls in each office
must be straight. On the others the
curve is very slight. The smaller offices
have a slight wedge shape, but this de-
stroys the boxy effect so often encoun-
tered in conventional offices.
Actually, the tower is not round but
polygonal and it is certainly not the
building that was originally intended.
It is not going to.be as high as archi-
tect Harry Seidler intended. He wanted
it about a third higher again. It has
not upset him that his original tower
has been truncated and plumped out.
“There is the same amount of space
contained within the structure,” he said.
“There will be the sanue amount of
office space available. In fact, a build-
ing in the round like this is very
economical. Only 20 percent of space
is taken up by the working core.”
The most important bqilding Seidler
has designed, Australia Square was
conceived in 1959. In 1963 the archi-
tect went to Rome to consult Professor
Nervi, to whom we owe the honey-
combed ceilings on the “exhibition
floor,” a by-product of the reinforced
floor above. In 1968 it should all be
completed, after having dominated the
thoughts of the architect for almost
nine years.
The Letters of Trevor Gooseboot
(Intercepted by Will Rushton)
Dear Mother,
The election over here is really hotting-up. Not, let me say immediately,
between the two major parties but as a result of the movements of one
Mr. Barton. This splendid man has decided to stir things up, which is an
attitude I have discovered during my short sojourn in this sun-kissed land
that is wholly un-Australian. I think I have written to you before about
the apathy here toward the Life Political. By and large, the knuckle is hastily
pushed into the beer-sodden face only on controversies about Rugby League or
Cricket. The movements of the Government itself are viewed with quiet con-
descension and a cry of “Your shout, mate!” Mr. Barton, however, has decided
to come between Harold and Arthur in that eternal search for peace and
quiet. Harold could never be anything but Prime Minister. Arthur, were he
awoken on the morning of November 27 with the news he was Minister,
would, in all probability, go off into a series of unseemly iits! The status is
comfortably “quo.” But Mr. Barton, Heaven bless his transports of delight, has
inserted his oar. It does an old English heart good to see. I know, Mother, that
you subscribe to the view that silence is the best medicine, but, used as I am
to a British general election, I can assure you that in comparison with an
Australian one Westminster is a positive Cow Palace, San Francisco, with 237-
piece brass band and dancing girls. Good on you, Mr. Barton, I say, dashing
into the colloquial, even if you never happened. Stir the great pudding!
Yours ever,
Trevor.
P.S. Perhaps, Mother, you will think from this letter that I have gone mad.
It is merely that I cannot imagine Australia’s continuing fear that the Chinese
will march through the streets of Darwin any minute. The world is growing
smaller every minute, and, at least, we English have let Hadrian’s Wall decay.

and was produced at McWilliam's Robin-
vale Winery in Victoria. During fermen-
tation the temperature was maintained
below 55° F„ and this has helped to retain
in the wine a very powerful aroma of the
grape, as well as a tremendous volume of
flavour. An ideal accompaniment to most
foods, particularly seasoned fish dishes,
white meats and poultry. It was awarded
a Gold Medal at the 1966 International
Wine Fair held at Ljubljana, Yugoslavia.
MCWILLIAM’S Private Bin 35
1963 Claret
The Hermitage grapes used to produce
this wine were picked exclusively from
our Hanwood Vineyards in the Riverina
district of New South Wales. Here, con-
trolled irrigation, accompanied by special
pruning techniques, helps to produce
grapes which give a “claret style," light
and delicate, but at the same time full
of flavour of the fruit and with a firm
tannin finish.
It was awarded a Silver Medal in the
International Wine Fair at Ljubljana,
Yugoslavia, in 1966.
McWILLIAM’S Private Bin 66
1965 Moselle
With its fragrant aroma and its delicate
fruity flavour, both enhanced by a slight
effervescence, this wine has the charac-
teristic qualities expected in a good
Moselle. These qualities make it most
suitable for serving with fish, salads and
all light dishes.
In the Queensland Royal National Show
of 1966, it was awarded a Bronze Medal
in the Vintage 1965 Medium Dry White,
Moselle Class.
McWILLIAM’S Private Bin 14
1963 Burgundy
Made from a blend of Hermitage and
Grenache grapes grown in the Riverina
District of N.S.W., this wine has the deli-
cate aroma of the fruit, is full-bodied and
has a soft, round palate.
It is an ideal accompaniment with meat
dishes and cheese.
In the Queensland Royal National Show
of 1966 it was awarded a Bronze Medal
in the Dry Red Table (Export) Class.
ON THE MARGIN
Tattoos Are For Ever
THE hazards of being tattooed have
been demonstrated in a striking
way by a sad case in Britain. A
young lady there, in a mood of irre-
sponsible euphoria, had the word
“Mild” tattooed on one breast and
“Bitter” on the other. Her father com-
plained that these inscriptions had
since caused her much embarrassment
and had seriously reduced her chances
of making a suitable and happy mar-
riage.
The tattooing, we must presume, was
undertaken originally as a joke. In
certain company and certain circum-
stances, it might conceivably be re-
garded as not a bad joke. Its appeal
is limited and regional, since the sell-
ing of ale in the categories Mild and
Bitter is a purely British custom. In a
wine-drinking country the young lady
might have achieved more effect by
the labels “Rouge” and “Blanc.” In
Sydney, where many people are ac-
customed to the products of Tooth’s
Brewery, a more appropriate legend
would be “Old” and “New.” None the
less, we can imagine that when she
first displayed her pectoral captions
to a sympathetic English audience she
got a laugh.
Her mistake lay in giving the per-
manence of tattooing to this fleeting
jest. Soon, no doubt, the amusement
died down. She was branded socially
as the Mild and Bitter girl.
It is-a good general rule if you con-
template being tattooed to avoid any
design with a literary or personal
content. The young sailor who has
“Nora” for ever on his forearm finds
the memento inconvenient when he
has switched his affections to someone
else. The only female a man can
safely commemorate on his person
is “Mother,” and even she is apt to
provide a handy means of identifi-
cation when he is wanted by the police.
But at least an amorous tattoo mark,
however obsolete, suggests a capacity
for grand passion. The facetious tattoo,
once its first impact has faded, is a
source of nothing but mortification. A
doctor in Melbourne told me he had
examined a patient, a respected man
prominent in local government, who
had an eye tattooed on each of his
buttocks, and underneath the eyes the
words “Good Morning.” It is not hard
to conjecture the years of remorse that
must have resulted from the perpetu-
ation of this youthful whimsy. The
alderman concerned always had his
back to the wall.
The ephemeral nature of humor
makes it essentially opposed to the
durability of tattooing.- That is why
anyone who has ever tried to be funny
whether in print, on the stage or
TV screen, or simply on social occa-
sions—must feel an instinctive sym-
pathy for the Mild and Bitter girl. She
has been punished for forgetting that
the world does not laugh at the same
joke twice.
The life of the party can offer to
abandon an anecdote if his audience
has heard it before. But it is hopeless
for the Mild and Bitter girl to say:
“Stop me if you’ve seen this one.” She
is, as modern thinkers say, committed
to her single built-in sight-gag.
It is the burden of all comedians,,
this public insistence that humor should
/be ever fresh and ever new. They look
with envy toward singers, those most
fortunate and least original of popular
entertainers. An A 1 Jolson could satisfy
his hearers by rendering Swanee again
and again, year in, year out. Audiences
actually prefer familiar songs to un-
familiar ones. But woe betide the wag
who repeats himself. “He’s run out of
material,” they say. “He’s slipping.” -
Children are a happy exception to
this rule. They will laugh repeatedly
at the same jest. I had years of success
with the simple expedient of taking the
empty shell of a boiled egg, turning it
upside down, and pretending it was
intact. But the children grew older
and more critical. I could not provide
sufficient new material, and I no longer
enjoy much repute as a domestic clown.
Turning again to consider the plight
of England’s Mild and Bitter girl, I feel
that the future is not necessarily as
bleak as she and her father believe. The
fickle public may have deserted her in
favor of entertainers with more novel
quips. But she will find warmth and.
compassion among those who know
by experience the risks and difficulties
of the droll. Some humorous column-
ist, or cartoonist, or comedy script-
writer will offer tenderness to the Mild
and Bitter girl, will make her his bosom
friend and perhaps his bride. He will
understand. He will not blame her for
having a chestnut that she can never
get off her chest.

AROUND MELBOURNE
“Which City is in Front.... ?”
PERHAPS you noticed that the
LBJ visit was carefully
arranged, precisely four hours
in Melbourne and four hours in
Sydney. No doubt the CIA had
a hand in this. No doubt discus-
sions took place at the highest level
on the fearful dangers of one city
getting one second more than the
other. The high office of the Presi-
dent of the United States simply
could not afford to get involved.
Well, your correspondent would
like to advise the CIA that this
attitude is a little out of date. Lately,
newspapers in both capitals have
been printing articles pointing out
the undoubted superiority of the
other city. The “Sun News Pictorial”
has been running articles in Mel-
bourne that Sydney vis leaving us
far behind. On the other hand,
the “Sun Herald” in Sydney has
been running articles that Sydney is
slipping and enterprising Melbourne
is gaining the upper hand.
The “Sun Herald” pointed out
that Melbourne had hit the front in
attracting more migrants than
Sydney, that it was attracting more
industry, that it was selling itself
more vigorously than Sydney, and
was winning the battle to get a
bigger and better international air-
port.
On the other hand, Melbourne’s
“Sun” says that Sydney has far more
vitality, more visual excitement, the
buildings are taller and more spec-
tacular. The city has a whole atmos-
phere of getting things done. Indeed,
it has already put down five times
our length of expressway. Then, in
another article, it says that Sydney is
getting ahead on crime. Once Mel-
bourne’s gunmen were the most
lethal in Australia. The big men of
the Melbourne underworld when
travelling interstate were feared and
feted like royalty by awed local
criminals. Not so any more. Now,
Sydney criminals look upon Mel-
bourne as a law-abiding city and
Sydney with its new reputation for
armed hold-ups and safe robberies is
clearly the crime capital.
Do you get the feeling of this new
attitude? The CIA has made a mis-
take. Here in Melbourne we would
be charmed if LBJ spent six hours
in Sydney and only two in Mel-
bourne. And on the other hand, un-
questionably, Sydney would be
thrilled if LBJ spent two hours in
Sydney and four in Melbourne.
This week your correspondent de-
cided to seek out the truth and
called on the Victoria Promotion
Committee. He put the blunt ques-
tion: “Which city is in front?”
Douglas Anderson, the committee
director, said: “The Sydney-
Melbourne business always reminds
me of Manhattan, New York. Syd-
ney is mid-town, from 43rd Street up,
where all the fun and life are. Mel-
bourne is downtown, the Wall Street
area. It’s not so much fun, but
they’re making a lot of money.”
But as for pinning it all down
by statistics, this was downright dif-
ficult. We looked at figures. It is
true that Melbourne is growing
faster and at the present rate should
pass Sydney in the mid-19705, and
according to the latest figures, Vic-
toria’s population growth for the
past years has been 1.89 percent
compared with 1.57 in N.S.W.
As for migrants, according to the
latest figures, Melbourne is slipping.
We had more in ’63-’64, but in ’64-
’65 N.S.W. had 48,349 and Victoria
44,427. In ’65-’66 it was N.S.W.
23,098 and Victoria 19,979.
But the important question was
“new industries” and how many had
been attracted. For years this has
been the favorite topic for all poli-
ticians in “marvellous Melbourne.”
Victorian Promotion Committee man
Dick Kerr pointed out that this was
the toughest point of all. He said:
“For example, we would dearly love
the figures on overseas investment,
“Lulu, are you there, Lulu? It’s
me ..."
but we can only get these from the
Commonwealth Statistician on an
Australia-wide basis.” Mr. Kerr
rather suspects that it is evenly
divided. Sydney gets a third of
the overseas capital, Melbourne gets
a third, and the other States get
the rest.
Your correspondent dug into files
of statistics, and if they seem to
favor Victoria please understand we
haven’t got them into line with the
new thinking and we’ll have them
round the other way next year.
Victoria for financial year ’64-’65 led
in new building completions
$67,450,000 to N.S.W.’s $59,864,000.
Victoria for ’64-’65 had the highest
personal income, $B3O per head, to
N.S.W. $752. Savings banks de-
posits at December 31, 1965, had
Victoria in front with $535.40, those
wise, cautious South Australians
second with $507.80, and N.S.W.
third with $418.20.
We could go on with other tedious
statistics. Victoria led over the three
years in factory expansion. We also
led in retail sales expansion.
As for the pure business of happy
living we have no statistics. One
takes it for granted that Sydney
Rugby League clubs are jollier than
our RSL clubs and that your Italian
restaurants serve better canneloni
than our Italian restaurants.
Furthermore, just three weeks ago
the Commonwealth opened another
wing of their vast Commonwealth
Centre at the corner of Spring and
Little Lonsdale Streets. Do you
appreciate the significance of this?
Little Lon was our red-light district,
rich in history. The six acres of this
once gay little area are now occupied
by important Commonwealth De-
partments. Of course, the female
population has gone up. Now there
are at least 1200 of them, but mostly
they’re employed at typing and
shorthand.
Yet there’s one other factor, per-
haps too early yet to judge its real
significance. Ru,mor has it that the
N.S.W. Government is cracking
down on stripping at the Cross. Girls
once gainfully employed have been
looking for jobs elsewhere. Just
lately most interesting advertisements
have been appearing in our news-
papers. For example, the Playboy at
South Yarra is now advertising:
“Topless Go-Go at the Playboy. 24
gorgeous exciting Go-Go dance
hostesses.”
Could it be that South Yarra, a
paint-throw from Dame Mabel’s, is
to become the new strip capital?

An Unnecessary Journey
“What has happened to everyone?"
By APRIL HERSEY
JON CLEARY, busy, bearded, and
three months back from London
with his new book, “The High
Commissioner,” just out and his next
book, “The Long Pursuit,” pouring
from the typewriter, is sadly conscious
that he didn’t really need to make this
sentimental journey. Whatever until
now has drawn him back to Sydney has
gone.
“I felt the disenchantment as soon
as I reached Mascot. It just isn’t there
any more. I don’t quite know what was
there—some excitement perhaps, some
feeling of homecoming. My friends, as
always, keep close contact and it was
wonderful to see them again. I’ve known
one friend since I was four, and we
write to each other every fortnight.
My godson is here, too. I exchange
long philosophical epistles with him.
No, it wasn’t the people. My disillusion-
ment is deeper, and this has upset me
greatly. My roots are very deep in
Sydney. But now I have to admit that
I’m very much happier in London.
“I’m even getting blocks in my writ-
ing, which is very unusual for me. If
I go out for what Arnold Bennett used
to call a “think walk,” in London I
get back to the typewriter revived and
excited by all the activity. Here I go
out into the garden, and I come back
in merely bored by my gardening
activities. In fact, I’m selling up, and
next March I will be returning over-
seas. I feel it is rather sad. I used to
feel Australia was a great place for
raising children, but my girls are now
in their late teens and all their friends
and interests are in London. Yes, it’s
sad.”
Sad, perhaps, but hardly surprising
for someone who has spent 15 of the
last 21 years overseas. Despite this he
has not assimilated much of the Eng-
lish style. He still looks, talks, and
appears to think in the Australian
idiom. His disappointment in Aus-
tralia seems to be as much a disappoint-
ment in himself. When he returned he
wanted to write an Australian political
satire, using a character he created
years ago called Fingel Mcßride. Fingel
was the central character in one of
Cleary’s few failures and he intended
to revive him as an SP bookie who
becomes Governor-General of Australia.
When the author settled down to listen
to broadcasts of Parliament, and made
pilgrimages to sit at the feet of the
speech-making politicians when they
spoke in their electorates, he was'
appalled at the standard of debate.
“Australian politicians struggle to
reach for cliches,” he said. “They can’t
even use platitudes well. What has
happened to everyone? Eddie Ward
would be a sensation today. I have
always been interested, as a spectator,
in politics, but this is a wasteland.”
Fingel has been returned to limbo
and the idea of his governor-general-
ship has been abandoned.
Not that Cleary isn’t busy. He is
hard at work on his novel set in
Sumatra. This has already been sold
as a film script.
“I am actually filling out the bones
of a scenario and I find it harder to
write than any other book I’ve done.
It is like working backwards.” He knows
Sumatra slightly and has researched it
well, but the basis of the story is on
the similar Syrian campaign in World
War 11, in which Cleary was himself
involved.
“It was the same sort of fighting, all
over and around civilians. It is in a way
concerned with the beginning of the
Vietnam thing, and the whole Asian
problem, though I don’t presume to
know my way around that quicksand.
I’m as confused as hell, like everyone
else. But this is the first time I’ve had
to write to a deadline with a book,
which is probably helping to make it
difficult.”
He is also working on a play called,
momentarily, “Strike Me Lucky.” This
is an adaptation of a book written by
his wife called “The Trumpets of
Home,” which was in turn taken from
a short story of his based on a real
situation, when a town in Victoria
struck gold and was suddenly divided
into the “haves” and the “have nots.”
One version of this has already been
played by the Arts Council of Great
Britain. “That was when I found I
knew nothing about stagecraft,” Cleary
said. “I had thousands of people on
the stage falling over each other. It’s
a challenge to make it a workable
play.”
Cleary has written several television
plays just to prove that he could. Two
were half-hour pieces, one a ninety-
minute play. This was produced on the
BBC, later offered to the ABC, which
rejected it as not good enough. Cleary
isn’t offended by this, though he has
been moved to write two letters to book
critics since he returned to Australia.
One on his own behalf and the other
on someone else’s. “The critics all seem
to write as though they are still trying
to please their old professors. You don’t
find this anywhere else in the world.
They try consciously to be clever and
to find the faults. To hell with anything
else about the book. Not only mine. I
objected to this other review because
they told the entire plot!”
The Australian’s desire to rubbish
himself is something that perplexes
Cleary. A keen cricketer, he plays with
a team calling themselves The Nonde-
scripts. The team includes ex-grade
players and generally pits its strength
against GPS old boys’ teams. When
someone made a spectacular catch re-
cently, Cleary said he found himself
making fun with the rest of the team,
then suddenly stood outside himself
wondering why. “I wouldn’t have made
fun of him in England. I would have
applauded. Why can’t we do that
here?”
Wealthy now beyond an ordinary
Australian writer’s dreams of paradise,
Jon Cleary is still interested in helping
fellow writers. He is haunted by them.
They find him by a kind of radar, and
he tries to be kind. He has a great
admiration for craftsmen like Graham
Greene and Irwin Shaw, envies Morris
West his easy flow which enables him
to dictate his books, and thinks West
has a “Shelleyan style in his lilting
phrases.” He even listened while West
read the whole of “The Shoes of the
Fisherman” to him chapter by chapter
when they were neighbors at Avalon.
The question of money is quite fas-
cinating and rather like listening to
fantasy to someone who has always felt
that $4OO is the most to expect from a
novel. Getting $30,000 for a film script,
$40,000 for a condensation in “Reader’s
Digest,” $50,000 for a television series
(turned down), and things like his
statement: “I’m never going to let my-
self get so worried about money” (i.e.
too much) “that I lie awake at night
or finish up like another writer I
know who literally had to leave the-
country within 24 hours or pay double
tax” all left me so stunned it was an
effort to ask him if he had ever been
poor.
The answer was no. He had begun
selling short stories while he was in
the Army “with all meals provided and
a roof, if a canvas one, over my head,”
and they all sold to American and
English magazines.
They were sold through an agent,
one a month for years and years. He
never had a reject. Some of his novels,
and this is his seventeenth, were not
so successful, but from “The Sun-
downers” onwards the way has always
been up, with higher and higher prices-
being commanded.

Reaching Biographical Maturity
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
OH, dear. Another royal biog-
raphy.* This one is on Prince
Charles, who is 18 this month and
has presumably reached required bio-
graphical maturity. There will be many
more on him, of course, to say nothing
of the other little royal heirs develop-
ing rapidly in that fertile stable.
However, this is not intended to be
a review of the book or a criticism
except, perhaps, to say in passing that
someone took a tiny gamble on page
212 with the sentence “Prince Charles
returned home with his face bronzed
by the Australian sun . . .”
Books are not published overnight
and this one appeared in Britain at
the beginning of August. Charles, in
fact, left Sydney on August 1, arrived in
Jamaica on the 7th, and returned to
England on the 17th. He might, after
all, have caught a ghastly disease, or
the plane might have crashed.
The last man I knew who took such
a liberty with the comings and goings
of the royal family printed a magazine
cover showing the
Queen sitting side-
saddle on her horse
at Trooping the
Color. It was a
beautiful picture,
every technicolor
facet of it. Her
majesty smiling
happily at her sub-
jects, the horse's
head inclined at the
right angle, the sky
as near tropical-blue
as the printers could
make it. Unfortun-
ately, that particu-
lar Trooping was
cancelled owing to
inclement weather.
What Prince
Charles’ biography
does for me is re-
vive memories of
those neurotic Fleet
Street days when
you'had the misfortune to be assigned
to a royal story. Assigned is, perhaps,
too dramatic a word for sitting at a desk
and riffling hour after hour through
cuttings. Occasionally you’d lift the
telephone and put a call into Bucking-
ham Palace, crossing fingers that Com-
mander Colville, the Queen’s Press
Secretary, wasn’t there and that with
luck the new girl whom you’d met and
buttered up the other night would let
slip a bit of information. The kind of
details I sought—i.e., how many dresses
would the Queen be taking on summer
hols.? had the nasty knack of coming
under the category of Personal Matter,
so end conversation.
Princess Margaret’s Press Secretary,
Major Griffiths, was a different kettle
of fish. We all thought better times
were ahead at his appointment, and I
remember one paper went into print
saying what a splendid, co-operative
fellow he was. He’d say jolly, quotable
things like the Princess had a super
time at such-and-such a party, and yes,
she’s up to her eyes with Christmas
shopping. Then he, too, took the silence
vow and became Personal Matter.
Royal stories came then, and I sup-
pose still do, in four categories:
(1) Official: Ascot, theatres, tours,
laying of stones, etc., that you watched
with all the Press.
(2) Private: The Queen’s putting in
a new bathroom, or what Princess Mar-
garet said about the organiser of a
ball, that you got from personal con-
tacts.
(3) Accidental: Bumping into the
Duchess of Kent buying boots in Bond
Street, or Princess Margaret shopping
for antiques in Islington.
(4) Intentional: Follow-up of news
paragraphs and the
Court Circular,
which showed what
royal personages
were up to, in the
hope that you’d get
a bit more. This
was rare, since it
1 brought you right
back to square one,
Buckingham Palace.
One became
adept at using
phraseology of the
“said someone close
to the family” kind
—or, “as a friend
put it.”
Certainly one
fresh royal fact
could be made to
go a long, long way.
My own personal
triumph was learn-
ing about Princess
Margaret’s plans
for her wedding service. Exactly
what they were I cannot now recall,
she was either dropping the obey bit or
putting it in twice over, but it is not
all that important. Neither is the source
of my information, though I deny that
it was the Archbishop of Canterbury.
This one scrap of news, plus a whole lot
of rehashed cuttings and half a dozen
pictures turned into a very pleasant
two-page feature which readers were
invited to cut out and keep.
I also knew someone who wrote the
entire romance of a European princess,
from the day she and her husband-to-be
met to the day they married. It read as
though he’d stuck by their side through
every move of their year-long court-
ship. In fact, he didn’t move one inch
from the library and all those useful
cuttings filed therein.

rally outright as well as the teams’
event. Peugeot continually beats all
comers, irrespective of price yet it
sells for only £1,275. At this price it’s
not common sense to settle for the
car “everyone” drives when you can
own a Peugeot! Peugeot quality shows
in extra performance, extra road
holding ability, extra braking effici-

Don Lane
By Will Rushton
Familiarity breeds popularity
Don Lane
Will Rushton
WHO is the real Don Lane? Why
Don Lane? Whither Don Lane?
What is the ghastly secret that
causes him to squat on the Harbor
Bridge every full moon and howl like
a coyote? For THE BULLETIN said,
in its infinite wisdom: “Rushton, we
want you to write the definitive piece
on Don Lane. You have worked to-
gether, talked together, even sung to-
gether. You must know him well.
Reveal all.” I replied at once: “The
Don Lane I know is a small, red-
bearded man of 57 with a high cack-
ling laugh and a cork leg.” “That,” said
THE BULLETIN, “is the sort of
stuff.”
As I strode away from the brood-
ing green eyeshade, the strong aroma
of ink, sweat, and cigars, I mused, for
muse I do. There is no doubt that I
admire Don Lane. Speaking personally
(and perhaps for thousands of others),
I hope that I am never called upon
to front three hours of live television
for 50 or so weeks of the year. Yet
the good Donald does. Admittedly,
there is a greater tolerance in Aus-
tralia than in, say, the Old Dart for
local performers. The voyeurs here are
extremely faithful, geared for bad
nights, happy to wait for a good one.
Familiarity breeds popularity, viz.,
Graham Kennedy. (Ten years old and
still going strong.) Even so, armed
with the knowledge that off-nights are
permissible, and in a long-running
show even desirable, the strain of per-
forming twice a week in the “Tonight”
show is immense. It represents to me
the epitome of the Australian brand
of instant television,
The theory of which is that if you
plant someone, a Dita, a Buzz, a Saucy
Hazel, firmly enough in front of a
camera with instructions to chat
amiably for half an hour, there is a
half-hour television program. It is
hardly likely that these worthies are
going to rise from their chairs after
only a quarter of an hour with a cry
of, “Well, that’s it. We can’t think
of anything else to say. Good day.”
The executives know that while their
personalities are equipped with Press
cuttings and cameras, they will deliver,
The “Tonight” show is more ambitious,
but equally based on the assurance that
Don Lane will be there for an hour and
a half every Tuesday and Thursday
night, will sing and provide jokes, will
interview whomsoever is sat beside
him, will do live commercials and
finally exit left singing “This is a Lovely
Way to Spend an Evening.” The
powers that are can rest easy in their
beds. There lies the strain.
I suppose the British equivalent of
such a program is “The Eamonn
Andrews Show.” The man Andrews is
an Irish ex-boxing commentator with
a friendly smile affixed to one side of
his face, a way with the mums, and
an interviewing style which would
reduce Oscar Wilde to a brief “Good
evening” and a few comments on the
weather. He sits at a desk while
celebrities slowly pile up beside him,
“plugging” their latest vehicles and
gimmicks, till the credits come up over
the final embarrassed cacophony of in-
anity. The show is but once a week
for an hour on Sunday night, yet he
has four or five full-time professional
journalists and a brace of jokesmiths
composing his quips and questions, and
a large production staff whose sole
function in life is the “Eamonn
Andrews Show.” Even so, I have seen
such lively persons as Ogden Nash and
Woody Allen fumble a while for words
and then relapse into a broody silence.
It does not, therefore, surprise me
that Don, with far more modest re-
sources at his beck, sometimes finds
difficulty in providing six minutes of
fun-packed interview with the Queen
of the Woolloomooloo Lupin Festival.
For it is imperative in this sort of
program, and usual, be it New York’s
Johnny Carson Show, Hanoi’s Ho
Chow Minh Hour, or whatever, to have
the Front amply backed. Bob Hope is
only as funny as his scriptwriters,
LBJ only as statesmanlike as his. At
his beck, and indeed his call, Don Lane
has only two writers, who labor also in
other vineyards, and two extreme pro-
fessionals in Noel Swanson, of the
Production Box (well versed in the Art
of Instant TV), and Geoff Harvey
(“With a Smile and a Song”). And,
given the circumstances, what they pro-
duce is, if not as impressive as bread
and fish out of empty hampers, never-
theless, to my boggling mind something
of a miracle.
us now split Don Lane the en-
tertainer into three The Inter-
viewer, the Song-and-Dance Man, and
the Comedian. We now have three
separate persons all two-foot and
one inch high. It must be admitted
immediately that never in the history
of television have all three met, so to
speak, in one person. It is asking a bit
much. (Another well-known feature of
Australian TV.) Even so, if I may slip
into the vernacular (cries of “Pray do”)
he isn’t bad. I’ll tell you what, mate:
Don is very conscious of his short-
comings, but, he’s an enthusiast and is
out to improve and does, and of how
many can you say that? (Cocks eye-
brow meaningfully.) He has an amaz-
ing device which records the shows for
him and he can then sit at home and
hurl abuse at himself. The singing is
pleasant enough and certainly a good
deal better than a number of those who
appear on the Box in bow-ties in front
of a number of strange scenic symbols


and give us “Just in Time” four times
an evening. His LP is very good, and
he takes singing lessons, when many
wouldn’t. As a comedian, of course,
he is a victim of the horrible vampire
television which sucks up material at a
hideous rate, but, e’en so, you don’t
spend 12 years in clubs on the West
Coast of America without learning a
thing or three. He is a great admirer
of Lenny Bruce, and that shows good
taste in a sick world. There are also
very few comics who are prepared to
play the “straight man,” but this he is,
on occasion, quite content to do.
I can’t quite work out whether these
comments come over as semi-sycophan-
tic or quasi-patronising. (Perhaps “bor-
ing” is the word I seek.) They are, in
fact, intended as a small tribute from
one telly-person to another, who un-
derstands the problem Fully. (The
capital “F” is my own.)
In all, there is more to Mr. Lane
than meets the Evil Eye. He is a pro-
fessional under hectic pressures and I’ll
have a glass with him any time. After
all, what greater bond is there between
any two performers than that they
should both have received “raves” in
the “Kalamazoo Gazette.”
THEATRE
Accolades All Round
The Knack. Ann Jellicoe. Russell Street,
Melbourne.
TOM is painting his room. Wherever
sunlight falls on the respectable
walls, he slaps on white paint.
Wherever there’s a shadow, he empha-
sises it with black. His words are as
deliberately contrasting as his decor.
“The white horse you saw in the park
may well have been a zebra synchron-
ised with the railings” is typical of his
sublime irrelevancies.
Accused of being childish, he replies
that he is childlike. A would-be Peter
Pan in his Never Never room, Tom
takes his feyness seriously. And when
North Country Nancy arrives out of
the blue, for a moment it seems that
he might have found a Wendy. But
Nancy is soon being hypnotised by
Tolen, the sexpert, and Tom returns to
his decorating and hangs chairs on the
walls.
Although Tolen and Nancy are the
protagonists in the play, it is the two
onlookers who become the central
characters. Tom, with his calculated
whfmsy, and Colin with his poignant
hunger for sexual know-how. To Colin,
sexual awakening has been a cruel case
of “stoking the fireplace while blocking
the chimney.”
Striding around the stage with the
slow-motion gait and tight trousers of
a Spanish dancer, Tolen, master of the
instant seduction, meets his match in
Nancy. Like Tolen, Nancy is more
a device than a character, and, in
Jellicoe’s comedy of manners, she’s re-
quired to do little more than cry
“Rape,” in a North Country accent.
Ogilvie’s buoyant production arrived
just as Melbourne theatre seemed to
be sinking for the third time, and it is
accolades all round. Richard Prins’ set
design is marvellous. He has narrowed
the stage down to half its usual width,
and has angled Tom’s room out into the
theatre, creating almost a proscenium
arch. Robin Ramsay (Tom) and Clive
Winmill (Colin) give exemplary per-
formances, and Lyndell Rowe is fun as
Nancy. John Gregg plays Tolen as if
the character was a camouflaged homo-
sexual, which is at least an interesting
possibility.
Certainly one of the year’s best pro-
ductions, and better than Lester’s film.

A Refined Look at Existence. Rodney
Milgate. Jane Street, Sydney.
The Public Prosecutor. Fritz Hochwalder.
Genesian, Sydney.
A REFINED LOOK AT EXIST-
ENCE” is set in an imaginary
Australian country town called
Dirch River, which is peopled by avant-
garde caricature of small-town dwellers
who speak in the language of advertise-
ments and cheap journalism and chop
logic like characters fropi lonesco or
Simpson. They also have connections
with Greek mythology, nominally at
least. Simile Smith, wife of Jovey, is
the daughter of Belly and Harmony
Cadmush, mother of Donny (Dionysus)
and aunt of Penthouse. The legends
associated with Dionysus, somewhat dis-

torted and condensed, provide the
framework of the plot.
The first act, including the murder
of Simile by the cuckolded Jovey, is
amusing farce. In the second act,
seventeen years later, Dionysus, now a
famous teenage singing idol, returns to
his home town to avenge the death
of his mother. With the entry of Diony-
sus the play changes character. From
being pure farce it broadens out to
become tragical, comical, satirical,
romantic, and incomprehensible.
Dionysus is the bearer of a serious
message: indeed, he steps down to the
footlights and delivers it, straight from
the shoulder, to the audience. But not
until the end, by which time I was so
exhausted by the onslaught of avant-
garde gimmicks, weak puns, flights of
imitation Joycean prose, crude satire,
and actors rushing around the auditor-
ium that I was unable to take in the
message.
An established painter who has newly
turned dramatist, Rodney Milgate cer-
tainly believes in taking the fight to the
audience and the art form. It is possible
to admire his spirit and energy while
deploring his lack of discipline and
clarity.
Producing this play must have been
like riding a buckjumper at a rodeo,
but Robin Lovejoy manages not to fall
off. Ross Thompson, as the romantic
Dionysus, Martin Harris, as his bitter
half-caste cousin Penthouse, and
Andonia Katsaros, as Donny’s secretary-
manager, give crisp performances which
almost create an illusion of order a,mid
the chaos.
“The Public Prosecutor” is set during
the French Revolution at the time when
Tallien was leader of the Government.
It is a neatly constructed dramatic
exercise, ideally suited for school pro-
duction. It has historical interest, strong
drama, and comic relief in the person
of the Chief Executioner (nicely played
by Terence Madden). But Harry
Collins’ production is much too re-
strained and gentlemanly. The French
Revolution was no tea-party, and the
Genesians should have exercised their
historical imaginations and played it
much tougher.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG:
TELEVISION
Endless Blather
WHEN and I sense the answer
is television going to cease its
fevered output of local shows
which are banal and inane, to choose
two of the least insulting words that
spring to mind? The ITS lot in
Sydney have just begun to inflict
viewers from Gabo Island to Cape York
with daytime shows called “Girl Talk,”
in which there are no girls, but women
and endless blather, “The Marriage-
Game,” which is an artless entertain-
ment, good for one week before it
becomes murder to the mind, and “Dita
and Buzz,” who are laughable when this
is not quite their intention.
Channel 7, too, has added to its list
of daytime horrors a half-hour show
called “Casebook,” said to be produced
(somewhere) with the help of the Aus-
tralian Medical Association. If you
know, or can imagine, some of the deli-
cate (or damned indelicate) things
patients ask their doctors about, “Case-
book” has them all.
I repeat, and may go on doing so-

until it has an effect, that adults even
if they are women, and even if the
channels think poorly of women’s intel-
ligence are surely a bit too bright to
actually watch the rubbish among day-
time shows. They may switch on, just
for the company, and the surveys may
list them as “watching” when asked:
“What show have you switched on?”
But we’ll see how long the ITS shows
last, nationally. “Casebook,” I am con-
vinced, was made only to be sent up by
“The Mavis Bramston Show.” People
are not “gonks” or “glooks.” The easi-
est thing for television to do, and a
thing it is doing with suicidal fervor, is
to sicken people of enough shows to
make them abandon television.
But the industry has a bad case of
astigmatism, and rarely sees beyond its
nose. Some time ago it learned that
more and more people were switching
off at 11 p.m., then 10 p.m., and finally
9 p.m. From this it concluded that what
it programmed before 9 p.m. must be
what people wanted. Spot the false
premise. Only now is it beginning to
unlearn this. One day its groping mind
will reconsider daytime programs, and
find they are related to all other tele-
vision.
The ABC does not learn anything
easily, either, or it would not persist
with “Australian Playhouse” and associ-
ate endeavors without second thoughts.
Two weeks ago it ran a John Croyston
play, suitable for a half hour, for 60
minutes, too long for anyone to watch
a • backyard quarrel masquerading as
drama. Last week “Playhouse” had a
Jeff Underhill piece which asked us to
believe the impossible.
In “A Small Wonder,” Melbourne
struck back at Sydney. Noel Ferrier, as
an uneasy husband who has done the
right thing by a girl he imagines must
think he is a bad bargain, acts out his
psycho-drama while the girl sits and
says nothing. After 27 .minutes of this
she tells him she loves him madly, he
says it’s a small wonder. Slow
fade. The real wonder was that anyone,
probably only me, was still there for the
dramatic climax.
FRANK ROBERTS
OPERA
Refreshing Barber
The Barber of Seville. Rossini. Eliza-
bethan Trust Opera, Palais, Melbourne.
ROSSINI wrote a good evening’s
entertainment when he put “The
Barber of Seville” together; the
fact that it happened to be in the form
of an opera is purely coincidental. As
an entertainment the Trust’s new pro-
duction is an unqualified success in
spite of the efforts of Mr. Stephan Beinl
(producer?) and the witless transla-
tion used. Good pop opera like this
is what the Trust should be doing, and
the gratifyingly large audience present
showed that a public anxious to be
pleased and entertained by opera exists
in this country. Coming on the heels
of an excellent “Trovatore” (better
than in Sydney, with Donald Smith in
Elizabethan Opera Company’s “Barber
of Seville,” now in Melbourne. Here
are Figaro (Ronald Maconaghie) and
Dr. Bartolo (Norman Yemm).
superlative form) the apprehensively
shortened Melbourne season could well
prove too short!
The success of this Barber is based
solidly on a fine setting by Ronald
Sinclair —a refreshing change—and a
cast which acts and sings as a solid
team. There are no great voices here,
but a series of artists willing to enter
into the spirit of things, yet able to
cope intelligently with the far from
easy musical aspects of this bel canto
opera. The Almaviva of Robert Gard
is a good example. Mr. Gard will
never be another Schipa, but I have
rarely heard cleaner runs, ornamenta-
tion and fioritura. He even produces
a passable shake, an almost unheard of
thing among tenors today. Add to
that an excellent characterisation, which
legitimately presents the count as an
exuberant young blade, and a superb
comic gift (his Don Alonso is opera’s
answer to Ronnie Stevens), and you
have an ideal performance limited only
by a clear, unforced, but otherwise un-
remarkable voice.
Ronald Maconaghie’s Figaro and
Alan Light’s Basilio are examples of ex-
cellent repertory acting and singing, as
is Rosalind Keene’s Rosina. That Mr.
Beinl saw fit to allow us to hear that
abominable lark instead of the music
Rossini wrote is not her fault. As
for Norman Yemm’s Doctor Bartolo,
this is such a priceless acting tour de
force that his vocal limitations become
almost unimportant. Even a few lines
allowed poor Fiorello are produced so
well that William Coombes may be
making history by getting himself into a
review of this opera. Robert Rosen
and the Melbourne Symphony Orches-
tra were noted mainly on the few
occasions when they drowned the
singers. They were better when least
obvious, as accompanists to the stage
action.
JOHN CARGHER
MUSIC
Communication
Alirio Diaz, guitarist. Sydney Conserva-
torium.
WHEN one of our smaller concert
managements arranged two re-
citals by Venezuelan Alirio Diaz,.
I was willing to give him a trial at the
least, even though I knew nothing of
him other than information in pub-
licity hand-outs and the fact that Sego-
via had taught and commended him.
In the event, I sat out the first recital
and eagerly returned for the second one,
including three encores, a few nights:
later; no doubt I will wish to return
for even more when he comes to Sydney
again later this month.
Segovia’s artistry is great, but he is-
so wholly self-contained that his contact
with the audience is very tenuous; John
Williams, another very fine musician,
seems completely withdrawn and, once
again, any rapport has to be established
by the listener. Mr. Diaz is different
and, though far from being an extro-
verted exhibitionist, he manages to make
direct contact with his audience.
The range of music in Mr. Diaz’s-
repertory is impressive. From his re-
cordings, unfortunately not widely avail-
able here, it appears that his main
leanings are toward Vivaldi and recent
“Spanish” music, but his intelligendy
constructed programs ranged a far
wider field. In the first one, in addition
to a 16th-century Spanish Suite ahd
two charming Scarlatti sonatas, he gave
a masterful reading of Bach’s third
cello suite, transcribed by Duarte. Here
was Bach of an utter purity and equal
to Casals’ interpretation of the cello-
original. He followed with a brilliant
guitar sonata by Castelnuovo-Tedesco-
and pieces of exhilaratingly Spanish
music by Albeniz.
The program for the second recital
was even more interesting. After open-
ing with a virtuoso work by 16th-
century Alonso de Mudarra, there was
a classical Suite by 17th-century Robert
de Visee, which includes one of the-
most hauntingly moving Sarabandes
I have ever heard. There were two of
Fernando Sor’s delightful studies, a
little reminiscent of his contemporary,
Schubert, and then a very beautiful
Sonatine by Torroba, a 20th-century
writer of no marked modernity.
Most exciting to me, in Mr. Diaz’s:
recitals, were the South American
works, even though, musically, they
were of only minor importance. There:
was a group of Venezuelan waltzes by
Lauro, folksy and with a catchy beat,
some quite spectacular Paraguayan
dances by Barrios, and music by Sainz.
de la Maza. Here was South American
music of our day, calling perhaps for
less earnest musicianship than Bach and.
Scarlatti, but just as demanding techni-
cally, music that seemed to give most
listeners the greatest pleasure.

All airlines have pilots. So why be so proud of ours? Because we know them
right from their very first plane ride. Where other airlines buy pilots,
we train them. From scratch. Even though it takes seven of our 56 plane fleet
to do it. And puts our senior captains into the instructor’s seat.
And keeps our graduate pilots in the co-pilot's seat. For a year at least.
And logs each of our captains 10,000 hours or more, before they ever see
the flight deck of a DCB. And still they could be 5,000 hours away
from the controls. Of course, they do make the most experienced flight
engineers, navigators and first officers in the business, which is what
we are after. Exactly. But perhaps you think we're a little extreme.
(Especially if you know how many pilots we lose to other airlines who buy
and don’t train!) But to us it’s worth it. Because it gives us an edge.
A little bit extra to offer all along the line. Even if it's up front,

Tigers of Wrath
Art Teachers. Cell Block, East Sydney
National Art School.
Alan Oldfield and Wal Randolph. Wat-
ters, Sydney.
The national art school
exhibition of work by full-time
teachers such as Coburn, Henshaw,
Gleghorn, Gould, and Dadswell takes
a lesson from U.K. and U.S. practice,
which is, in the succinct words of a
Minneapolis instructor, to show the
work of their teachers as creative, not
frustrated or defeated artists. Accord-
ing to this doctrine, art is by no means
a craft, but a quest that engages a
teacher and student alike; one may
suspect that this exhibition, commend-
able in itself, is a little crafty. One
of the criticisms levelled against the
Technical College is that it has been
so remote from life outside its prison
walls that teachers have been discour-
aged from exhibiting, and when two
students in mid-courses showed several
years ago, authority was aghast. No
such attitudes prevail today.
What models do the teachers pro-
vide? There is a spirit of adventure in
Coburn and Gleghorn, sometimes
eclipsed, but more often enhanced, by
an assured professionalism; risk vies
with authority in Dadswell’s sculptures
of brown-paper, sticky-tape wound over
armatures. They look as solid as wood
and as fragile as autumn leaves; the
layers give the effect of steps leading
into declivities and turn the swelling
concave and convex shapes into soaring
wings. Other exhibitors are more
sedate, cautious, staid, academically
modern, or unambitiously pleasant;
there’s a lot of respect for craftmanship
and, while some are timid, reactionary
complacency seems dead. Students
blindly agog for daring may not see
much in the distilled refinements of
Laverty or de Teliga, who aipi at a
fleeting indeterminacy, each a Pan
rather than a Stentor.
They may be more attracted, near
the entrance, by a huge mural of
inches-thick, boiling, frothing, pink and
white resins that has been lent to the
College by its creator, Jan Riske. Like
Mount Fairy Floss in eruption, it tosses
in such sweet thunder that much of
what is inside the Cell Block begins
to look decorous, calculated, and caught
in a dead calm.
Outside the College, one of its stu-
dents, Alan Oldfield, a most sensibly
articulate critic of some aspects of its
teaching, chooses as mentor Brett White-
ley. The important aspect is not that
he has chosen someone whose practice
is quite foreign to the College’s but
that he has so unequivocally declared
his allegiance that he has been accused
of going all the way with Whiteley
around Watters’ walls.
His former dogged cubism has given
way to Whiteley nudes at the edge of
paintings, to wan Whiteley women in
baths, to Christie victims succumbing
to ambiguous gas tubes, to rows of
small Whiteley-vignettes across the top
of paintings (Daws and James do it,
too), and to Whiteley’s faded ochres,
brown-blacks, pearly-whites, and pul-
sating reds. He hasn’t gone all the way;
he’s tidied Whiteley up; he calculates
his areas .more carefully; his colors
rarely slop; his lines don’t look pro-
visional, and his corrections don’t show
through as with Whiteley. I’ve heard
him praised for his craftmanship that
springs from a precise sensibility, but
one could say that this is Whiteley
neatly packaged and blandly homog-
enised, because the throwaway uncer-
tainty, the sheer indecision, the calcu-
lated irresolution in a Whiteley are
therefore various psychological pur-
poses: Christie’s head loses precise con-
tour and begins to disintegrate; bodies
on beds may be in the throes of death
or orgasm and the vast empty areas
are sometimes anguished abysses or
boring emptiness. With Oldfield, spaces
are quite beautifully painted areas,
visual soft-carpets.
Sometimes he does capture Whiteley’s
waywardness and spontaneity: “Pos-
session of the Ursulines II” has a fine
play between assurance and caprice;
but, such is his command of space and
paint, he needs to capture nothing of
Whiteley’s, and rather than Christie or
crouching nudes he needs a cause, like,
perhaps, caricatures of his college cate-
chists.
Wal Randolph, his fellow exhibitor,
hasn’t been to college, but he’s met
the scholars, especially those dealing in
collages of cut-up action-paintings or
of newspapers enmeshed in clumsy,
gestural slashes. He uses the newspaper
cuttings or the square mosaics he fits
together from cut-up drawings to re-
duce both the slickness and wildness
of his calligraphy. He is trying to rein
in a natural turbulence, and though
he has hardly begun it is refreshing;
Oldfield, a painter of definite promise,
needs to slacken the bit, and some of
the Technical College’s teachers . . .
well, as Blake said, better the tigers
of wrath than the horses of instruc-
tion.

Repulsion. Director, Roman Polanski.
Rattle of a Simple Man. Director, Muriel
Box.
AFTER his fine film “Knife In
The Water,” Roman Polanski
takes a giant step backwards with
“Repulsion,” a pretentious, distasteful,
unutterably slow-moving study of
mental disintegration.
Carol is a pretty Belgian girl living
with her sister in London and working
in a high-class beauty salon (which,
incidentally, would never have em-
ployed such an obvious nut, particularly
one who cardinal sin for a manicurist
bites her nails). Disgusted yet

mental breakdown when her sister
leaves her alone while she goes holiday-
ing with her lover. Alone in their
shuttered flat, with a foetus-like skinned
rabbit decaying on the telephone table,
Carol indulges in nightmare fantasies
of rape and clutching hands, interrupt-
ing herself occasionally to murder a
couple of men who make advances,
honorable or otherwise.
By treating madness with humanity
and compassion, Bergman made
“Through A Glass Darkly” a deeply
moving experience; Hitchcock in
“Psycho” made it good, macabre enter-
tainment by deliberately never relating
his characters to real human beings.
Polanski has tried to have it both ways;
his approach is snobbishly intellectual
(no cheap Hitchcock thriller touches!)
yet basically merely sensational. A
director doesn’t show understanding or
profundity merely by adopting funereal
pace or by overloading a film with
obvious sexual symbols even the
postcard sent by Carol’s sister shows
the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It’s a good
thing she didn’t go to Greece; the
Acropolis would have really finished
poor Carol.
The maddening thing about
“Repulsion” is that Polanski is still a
considerable director. Technically the
film is often fascinating, the soundtrack
exciting and disturbing as it records the
jangle of bells, the explosive rending of
the walls, which seem to the terrified
girl to be disintegrating around her.
The dialogue it records is less stimulat-
ing; there’s a curiously unreal, foreign
ring to it, possibly because of the Polish
director’s unfamiliarity with the true
rhythms of English. Polanski uses his
camera imaginatively to make the walls
of the apartment-prison sometimes
crowd in on the girl, sometimes stretch
into labyrinthine corridors. But all his
effects are deliberately calculated for
sheer shock value; there isn’t a hint
of the understanding of human motives
and emotions that made “Knife In The
Water” so remarkably impressive.
“Rattle Of A Simple Man” is
directed in a thoroughly straight-
forward stodgy manner and is, in fact,
despite its attempts to be daring and
outspoken, a fine old-fashioned piece of
sentimentality.
Charles Dyer himself adapted his
play for the screen, so must shoulder
the blame for the interpolated scenes
—the unconvincing family reunion, that
impossible wild party; the whole thing
was less obviously novelettish in the
terser form of a one-set, three-character
stage play. Harry Corbett does manage
at times to be genuinely touching, but
Diane Cilento can’t do much with the
unlikely character of the tart —for one
thing her rich round tones and general
arrogance of bearing seem genuinely
upper-class, not the pathetic false re-
finement of a girl putting on dog. Nor
are her looks improved by nose-bob-
bing (which in this post-Streisand eri
she must bitterly regret), which has
turned a handsome aquiline beak into
a shapeless blob.

BOOKS
McGregor’s Australians
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
Profile of Australia. Craig McGregor.
Hodder and Stoughton. $6.
PROFESSOR HANCOCK, Brian
Fitzpatrick, Bill Wannan, J. D.
Pringle, Donald Horne, Colin
Maclnnes, Jeanne Mackenzie (to name
a few), and now Craig McGregor. The
trickle has become a torrent, and Stoney
Creek a raging Hunter River in full
flood.
Each new spring day seems to bring
another book, or promise of one, an-
nouncing some native or foreign pun-
dit’s penetration of the so-called “Aus-
tralian scene.” And to think it was once
called “Terra Australis Incognita.”
Who would have thought that our
little nation, like Macbeth’s vascular
system, had so much blood in it that it
could support such a teeming parasitic
sub-culture?
And the books get longer the more
they multiply. This one is a profile:
a profile three hundred and ninety
eight pages long. It is surely enough
to daunt the most egocentrically pat-
riotic spirit, and therefore my first
words must be of praise for the author.
Despite my prejudice that a closed sea-
son ought to be declared on Australia,
and an initial disbelieving horror when
the profile arrived in its full 400-odd
pages, Mr. McGregor managed to hold
my interest most of the time.
Explaining why is not so easy. For
one thing there are a lot of mistakes,
which even the most general of readers
is likely to find irritating: that Aus-
tralia is the home country of Neville
Cardus, that one is eight times more
likely to be murdered in Sydney than
in London, that the main meal of the
day for most Australians is usually
the midday one, that nearly all the
social democratic parties of the Western
world have suffered an eclipse in the
post-war years, that the club has re-
placed the Church as the main centre
of Sunday activities (wrong on both
counts), that Perth has only one daily
newspaper.
These are only some among a fairly
substantial list, which includes mis-
spellings of the names of Fred Zinne-
mann and Giorgio Mangiamele.
In addition, whilst one hopes that
a profile will be opinionated, a number
of McGregor’s observations seem rather
more tendentious than illuminating: I
got my second-best laugh of the book
out of the statement about Brigadier
Charles Spry: “Despite his reluctance
to appear in public, he is regarded as
one of the most powerful men in Aus-
tralia” (shades, no doubt, of the dread
pressure he brought to bear on Profes-
sor Stout’s proposed attendance at a'
peace conference).
McGregor manages to carry these
burdens in the general weight of his
prose and to maintain a surprising level
of interest and competence, though
there is very little wit and the examples
of Australian humor are banal: the
lavatory graffito “Smile, you’re on Can-
did Camera,” and the unbowdlerised
version of the old ballad with the
“particularly memorable” last stanza:
But Nobby strained and broke the
yoke,
And poked out the leader’s eye,
Then the dog shat in the tucker box,
Five miles from Gundagai.
It is, I think, a general consistency
and soundness of sociological comment
that makes the book readable. Very
little of it is new in any sense, but Mc-
Gregor has a good eye for the best
example to illustrate the point he is
making.
He makes good judgments:
“Despite the material benefits they
enjoy, the high standard of living and
the comparatively free and easy life,
Australians are hardly a joyous people;
their approach to life is wary, even
Craig McGregor
hostile. Scratch an Italian and you
find a happy man; scratch an Austra-
lian and you find a philosopher.
“Australians seem to expect every-
thing and to become bitter when it is
not achieved. In Britain many working
people, even now, accept their station
in life as natural and inevitable and
are resigned to the unlikelihood of
change ... in Australia the working
man’s reaction is more likely to be a
loud oath and a tirade against the boss
—he’s been cheated out of his birth-
right and he knows it.
“Egalitarianism, in fact, is the per-
sistent motif which runs through Aus-
tralian culture and the people them-
selves . . . They are individualistic,
informal, easy-going, frank, good-
natured” - all more or less correct,
though there are many Australians who
are none of these things “but the
feeling that one man is as good as
another is the most characteristic
quality of social relations, and as an
ideal it has power over executive and
working man alike.”
McGregor also deserves our grati-
tude for his exploration of the journal-
istic possibilities of almost every
opinion poll taken within polling
memory. Numerous Gallup polls and
university surveys are used to verify
the text, as well as Commonwealth
Bureau of Census and Statistics figures
and relevant lists of odds and ends
from all kinds of learned journals. The
whole opera of “Current Affairs Bulle-
tins” has been carefully examined for
every worthwhile fact and opinion.
In a man of such journalistic and
sociological inclinations, the cautious
intelligence displayed in the chapter on
“The Arts” is a slightly unexpected
pleasure. McGregor has an instinct for
picking the brains of the good judges.
Thus are related Chris Wallace-
Crabbe’s comment that -the “habit of
irony” best explains much of the work
of the rising generation of poets such
as Francis Webb, Vincent Buckley,
Bruce Dawe, J. R. Rowland, and Evan
Jones; and A. D. Hope’s review (in
1956) of “The Tree of Man” that “Mr.
White has three disastrous faults as a
novelist: he knows too much, he tells
too much, and he talks too much . . .
however delightful at first, it produces
in time irritation, then torture, and
finally a numbness of the brain.”
The list of names and publications
is enlivened by appropriate fact and
story. That twentieth-century music
is largely neglected is illustrated by
noting that Alban Berg’s violin con-
certo was not performed in Australia
until 1963, a quarter of a century after
its composition; “The Ham Funeral,”
we are told, had its genesis in a story
which William Dobell told Patrick
White: Dobell’s landlord was found
dead in the London residential where
the painter was staying and the land-
lord’s wife was determined to bury
him in some style: “This isn’t going to
be a Leg O’ Mutton funeral,” she
said. “It’s going to be a real Ham
Funeral with all the trimmings.”
McGregor does not forget to mention
the memorable banner of the Sydney
“Daily Mirror,” which followed the
first performance of White’s “The Sea-
son at Sarsaparilla”: “NEW PLAY
STINKS.”
After so much good reporting it
seems a pity that the book should fall
away so quickly into cliche and com-
pulsive prejudice in its political com-
ment. Whitlam is “vain” (which poli-
tician is not?); and the whole of our
political life is judged in terms of a
left-right spectrum which is fast losing
both correspondence and coherence.
A number of gratuitous political in-
sults are thrown around. Whitlam, we
are told, “is not a social reformer,


he is not stirred up by inequality or
social injustice.” THE BULLETIN
has a “political approach which is dis-
torted by the extremely Right-wing
stance of its parent company.” The
Association for Cultural Freedom is
dismissed in the sentence, “Anti-Com-
munism soon attracted other, rather
less-principled, supporters.”
Anti-Communists, in any shape or
form, are not part of McGregor’s notion
of a Cup of Tea, A Bex, and a Good
Lie Down, and he crudely lumps them
all together on the right-hand side of
history. He is not much fonder of prag-
matic Labor politicians, either.
The ALP is explained in terms of
“Gradualists” and “Radicals;” “to
obtain and retain power . . . the Party
does not need to abandon its radical-
ism . . . but its radicalism will have to
take new forms”; “there is room for
radicals.”
When we examine the list of so-
called new policies they range from
abolishing flogging to breaking up mon-
opolies—we find that the New Radi-
calism is only old social reformism writ
large. McGregor’s desire for a better
social welfare system or the aboli-
tion of capital punishment and laws
against homosexuality, for a vote for
Aborigines and abolition of the White
Australia Policy, for tighter control of
orei §? invest ™ ent and restrictive prac-
tices, for greater equality of educational
tuni * is pro 4 ba bl y shared bv most
supporters of the National Civic Coun-
cilj all of the friends of Gough whit .
lam, a lot of writers for THE BULLE-
TIN and “Quadrant,” and a good
proportion of Liberal Party members
under 35.
“Radical,” it seems, is a word that
McGregor and his radical mates use
to cheer one another in the cold hours
when the talk turns to politics.
Portrait in Black
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
The Watch Tower. Elizabeth Harrower.
Macmillan. $3.20.
ONE of the dominant themes in the
Australian novel at present is
the conflict between sensitive and
insensitive people, and the way in
which the insensitive will attempt to
undermine and destroy people who they
jealously suspect are different and
perhaps superior to themselves,
It is a major theme in Patrick
White’s work, and it is also important
to the novels of Elizabeth Harrower.
This theme looms much larger in Aus-
tralian literature at present than it
does in overseas literature. The cause
of this is probably Australia’s tradition
of aggressive philistinism and the
national habit of regarding culture as
something cissy. However, all this is
rapidly changing. Young layabouts
who years ago were aggressive he-men
now get around with hair tinted blond
and are more interested in the Rolling
Stones than in football. Old stalwarts
of the Labor Party are still suspicious
Elizabeth Harrower
of people with university degrees, but
they are a dying race.
However, this theme of conflict be-
tween the sensitive and insensitive is
still very strong in Elizabeth Harrower
and Patrick White, because they both
came to maturity when prevailing
mores were much more anti-intellectual
than they are now. Miss Harrower’s
very beautiful second novel, “The
Long Prospect,” was published in 1958
and it contains an illuminating passage
about Australia:
“Then and there, in the cities, great
wealth masked a naivete one would
hesitate to call childlike. A contradic-
tory striving after perpetual adoles-
cence, sophistication, and an accumula-
tion of wealth were the motives of
action . . . To be one of the self-
critical minority was to be not so much
politically unsound—for there was very
little, it seemed, to be political about
as thoroughly, disagreeably un-
Australian. Two members of the
small minority meeting could not
easily part without a promise of fur-
ther meetings, letters, communication.
The opportunity was rare.”
“The Watch Tower” explores some
of these preoccupations. Laura and
Clare Vaizey are the daughters of a
selfish mother, who takes her children
away from a good boarding-school
when their father dies and sends them
out to w 7 ork as soon as she is able, so
that she may lead the life of a lady
of leisure. The elder of the two girls
had the ability to follow in her father’s
footsteps and become a doctor, but this
The girl who turned herself into a reef
If the bronze girl on the esplanade
(The Maori one who turned herself into
An offshore reef on account of some sadness in love
And now grows kelp from breasts and eyes) if she suddenly had
A change of heart, came down and out of
The tourist legend, alive, adjusting her rustling yellow
Grass skirt well, naturally the cops
Would have her up in front of the magistrate
For wearing a topless garment (exceptionable
In flesh, though not so much in bronze) —i but supposing someone
Gave her an overcoat, took her round the shops,

Avenues of norfolk pine just as the sun
Was sinking over the sea put her on the stage in the concrete
Soundshell shaped like a gigantic ear,
And handed her the microphone Would she then say,
“Thank you! Thank you! Now it is possible
For me to live” or would she run
Grouching and weeping down the car-lined street
Past the ice-cream shop and the swimming-pool
To outwit the totems of our terrible day
(Bright lens, white stone, dull eye, dry skull)?
Yes, to plunge deep down the shingle stair
Of the beach, and spread her arms out under
The waves, turning again to rock, having escaped this air,
Nourishing only fishes and spray.

is no concern to Mrs. Vaizey, who
sends her off to become a stenographer.
While the younger of the two girls is
still actually at school, Mrs. Vaizey
decides to desert her children and flit
off to England, where she has congenial
relatives. So Laura is obliged to marry
Felix, her boss, who is considerably
older than she is.
Felix appears to be reasonably plea-
sant, even though he rather lacks style.
He seems indistinguishable from the
average run of moderately successful
businessmen, with a mixture of mean-
ness and extravagance. However, he
has a disturbing glibness and shallow-
ness. He buys a handsome white
colonial house for Laura, himself, and
Glare to inhabit in the Sydney suburb
of Neutral Bay and Laura imagines
that they will do a lot of entertaining
there. But in fact it emerges that he is
virtually friendless, and that his many
acquaintances are business associates
who avoid invitations to dine at his
house. Laura and Clare are themselves
totally friendless and completely de-
pendent on Felix, and so they form a
small isolated social unit.
Felix soon turns the house into a
house of terror and uncertainty for the
two women. He buys a succession of
businesses and employs Laura and Clare
in the businesses without paying them.
Laura works long, hard hours to help
him build these businesses up, but
always at the moment when a business
has become profitable he sells out at
a ridiculously low price to some per-
sonable young man. And not only does
Felix have homosexual tendencies but
in addition he can be aggressively
alcoholic. He likes to hold the centre
of attention, but as soon as things go
bad for him he starts to become vio-
lent. He continually speaks of women
as being unclean creatures whom no
healthy man wants anything to do with.
H IS philistinism, his flashiness and
corruption have much in common
with the values of Lilian in “The Long
Prospect” and who played a similar
role in that book. However, he is much
more sinister and vicious than Lilian.
He is a portrait of almost unredeemed
evil.
Eventually, he brings a Dutch boy
suffering from malnutrition into the
household. The final part of the novel
traces the struggles between Felix and
Clare, who has now become financially
and socially independent, for the
loyalty of this boy. Felix wants the boy
to go into business with him, but Clare
wants him to become a scientist. Clare
wishes to escape from this terrible
household, but Laura, who is loyal to
her husband, Felix, although she suffers
abominably at his hands, cannot bear
the idea of Clare leaving because it
would upset Felix and her own plans.
The Dutch boy comes to symbolise
Clare’s struggle.
This novel is intense and gripping.
For me it has only one fault. The
characterisation of Felix is on the whole
convincing, and it is certainly unusual
and not a stock literary type. However,
some of his business deals seem quite
far-fetched and improbable. The ease
with which he buys businesses, builds
them up, and then sells the,m at a loss to
handsome young men is astounding. If
he were as hopeless as all this, it is
difficult to see how he is able to build
the business up in the first place. A
person of his type usually overvalues
rather than undervalues his business.
Primarily, Elizabeth Harrower is con-
cerned with relineating the relation-
,•r, & , ,
ship of two sensitive and dependent
women with a man who is a spiv. This
~ , . . . r
is well done, as the author has a pene-
trating grasp of psychology and
psychologically the portrait of Felix is
accurate even if some of his business
deals are not plausible.
Elizabeth Harrower’s prose has a
quality of intense compassion and suffer-
ing. Here she differs from Patrick
White, for where White is savage she
is resigned. Her writing has an elusive
femininity. It is a quality which is diffi-
cult to describe, but it is something
which most very good women writers
such as Virginia Woolf or Katherine
Mansfield have. It is a quality of “sym-
pathy.”

A Fear of Loving
By R. G. HOWARD
For Love Alone. Christina Stead. Angus
and Robertson. $3.95.
THIS is the fourth of Christina
Stead’s books to be reprinted in
the past twelve months. It begins,
promisingly, with a series of set-pieces:
a family dinner presided over by a
leonine and capricious father; a
middle-class wedding described with a
satirical flair that Miss Stead unfor-
tunately does not choose to employ
again; a hen session between aunt,
daughter, and niece, lounging on a
bed on a hot night; and an atmospheric
walk along Watson’s Bay. But, effective
as they are, these scenes seem, in the
context of the novel, too expansive.
They, do, however, serve by their im-
petus to carry one through the slow
beginning of the central relationship.
.... r . .
This relationship is fascinating
Teresa Hawkins, nineteen-year-old
schoolteacher, is obsessed with fan-
tastes of love and sex. Her life is domi-
nated by fear of becoming an old maid,
a fate heartlessly predated by father
and bro hers. Out of this fear is born
a fake love for the bitter misogynist
student Jonathan Crow. The stages of
this unhappy affair are brilliantly
c ar e ‘
From London, where he has taken a
scholarship, Jonathan, out of curiosity
and the urge to “experiment,” writes
her (and several other girls) love
letteis. Teiesa painfully saves up the
fare to England in the belief that he
will marry her when she arrives.
The second half of the novel shifts
from a Sydney that is sometimes
vividly, sometimes mechanically de-
picted (the University, the slums of
Darlinghurst, and a semi-fictional Wat-
son’s Bay) to London. Here the rela-
tionship between Teresa and Jonathan
is developed with further skill. Jona-
than, paranoid and vain, callous, and
occasionally tender and Teresa, dogged
and submissive, maddeningly credulous,

Half the characters in the book are
realistically drawn, the other half
caricatured. Quick is one of the latter,
a larger-than-life figure who doesn’t
quite come off. Whereas her minor
caricatures (Teresa’s father and Aunt
Bea) are well done, Miss Stead in this
book at least doesn’t seem able to sus-
tain such figures.

CREATING THE CLIMATE FOR PROGRESS
Horse-talk
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Irish Lad. J. C. Bendrodt. Angus and
Robertson. $3.25.
The Rim of the Morning. Colin Thiele.
Rigby. $2.25.
JIM BENDRODT, owner of the
“Caprice” restaurant, racehorse
trainer, lumberjack, and dancer,
writes in a racy, unforced vernacular
lightly sprinkled with aphorisms, about
animals. What makes this collection
unique is Bendrodt’s special communi-
cation with the horses and dogs he
has known as intimates.
Cruelty to animals shocks Bendrodt
into a murderous rage and is the moti-
vating force behind some of his most
powerful writing. In “Butch,” he gives a
true account: as a 17-year-old, he bat-
tered a man twice his size near to
death in a fist fight in a Canadian forest
for deliberate cruelty to a dog. “Chow-
sie” is another story arising out of wrath
at inhumanity. This time it is aimed
at those wartime owners who took their
dogs to be killed rather than share their
rations.
In “Nine O’Clock,” the cruelty is
committed through carelessness rather
than callousness, but it is rightly viewed
no less scathingly. Here the author
makes an appeal on behalf of those
once feted racehorses which have out-
lived their usefulness and go to an un-
necessary death in the slaughterhouse.
Even when, in some yarns, his sentiment
co,mes close to running over into senti-
mentality, it is so clearly a heart-felt
expression, that it does not repel.
JN each of Colin Thiele’s stories the
main figure is always a boy mount-
ing the hill of life toward “The Rim of
the Morning” of manhood, and the im-
pression of timeless youthfulness is rein-
forced by the refreshingly direct style.
At the beginning of “The Water Trol-
ley,” most important and longest of
the six tales, Paul is a schoolboy living
on an inland station, but by the time
he has undergone a terrible initiation
ceremony at the hands of the contin-
ent itself, he has become a fully fledged
man. In one stroke an explosion in the
pumping system robs the station of his
father (who is taken to hospital by the
Flying Doctor) and of its entire tank-
supply. Trying to collect water from
an artesian bore some miles away, Paul
is overtaken by a sandstorm; and, shel-
tering in a cave, half delirious, he im-
agines the ancient Aboriginal paintings
on the walls and the prehistoric mon-
sters from the Dead Heart are staging
a corroboree around him which awakens
even the Rainbow Serpent coiled deep
under the earth, testing his strength
with ordeal by sunfire and ordeal with-
out water. Paul finally stumbles ho,me
with a drum of dirty sludge, looking
like “a small replica of those giant ex-
plorers who brooded for ever over Aus-
tralia’s heart.”


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
he Back Brake
KICKING the Government over the state of the economy
is a political rather than an economic game at present.
And the Holt Government’s refusal to admit that any-
thing should be done to help along a recognisable flagging
growth rate, despite the coming election, seems to indicate
great electoral confidence —or else massive unconcern at
problems that in some sectors are real and serious.
The indices now available show that in retrospect there
can be no doubt the Government has been too cautious in
failing to act decisively to restore confidence and give things
a boost. Looking back, we could have done with expan-
sionary measures in February —taking that 2.5 percent addi-
tion off company tax for instance. And the Budget in August
was definitely too careful. Mr. McMahon seems unhappily
to have quickly acquired the Treasury habit of leaning over
backwards to avoid the problems of growth, and half break-
ing the back of that growth in the process. Not that things
are dismal everywhere; among last week’s statistics, providing
food for thought on the state of the economy, there was some
good news on consumer spending.
At last, after almost two years of stagnation, retail sales
show the first sign of getting off the dismal plateau. It is too
early for the proclamation of recovery, but the cheerful
signs are there. The September quarter is usually one of the
slackest for the retail trade, but this year it has gone ahead
steadily and, after seasonal adjustment, suggests an annual
rate of sales of $6.8 billion. This is a good advance on the
$6.6 billion around which they fluctuated uncertainly in the
last three quarters of last financial year. (That year saw
sales of just over $6.5 billion.)
Next week, over 100,000 Commonwealth public servants get
big superannuation payouts which add up to $25m., an
amount which should help push general spending along a
little. As each week passes, rural prospects grow brighter,
and so the farming community shapes up as a source of
stimulus, too.
But the massive building industry is looming up as the
weak spot in the economy. Private housing shows no signs-
of climbing further back toward the 1964-1965 levels of
105,000 a year. It is stuck at a little below 100,000 and has
been this way ever since recovery ceased in April. It is true
that a bunching of Government housing approvals seems to
have boosted the overall total slightly in recent months, to
about 115,000 in annual terms. This is an improvement on
the 108,000 of the last quarter of 1965, but again it is
nowhere near the 125,000 of 1964 to early 1965 and it shows
no signs of getting any nearer.
On this basis, the housing section of the building industry
is not going to be an expansive force in the economy until
well into next year at the earliest, and even then not
unless a boost is given to housing very soon.
But it is the non-housing section of the industry which
faces not a lack of growth but a decline in activity. The
Commonwealth Statistician puts anticipated expenditure by
business for this second half-year as down on the first
half, and anticipations have in the past tended to be well
on the optimistic side. Sharp falls are expected in spending
in the motor industry and textiles, in mining and com-
merce, and other non-manufacturing generally.
The fall in expected expenditure on plant and equipment
will be even greater according to the Statistician’s data:
MEN AND MATTERS
PEOPLE who like going to trade
fairs (and owners of exhibition
halls for hire, like the Royal
Agricultural Society) are in for a
bonanza. For the pros have really
moved into the trade-fairs business in
Australia. Britain’s two leading trade-
fair promoters, Industrial and Trade
Fairs Holdings Ltd. (the world’s big-
gest) and Exhibition Promotions Pty.
Ltd., are now battling for what they
consider to be a massive market poten-
tial for trade fairs both in Australia
and for promoting Australia in over-
seas centres.
Both companies are offshoots of the
newspaper industry. Industrial and
Trade Fairs Holdings is owned 40 per-
cent by the “Financial Times,” 40 per-
cent by Mr. Cecil King’s International
Publishing Co. (the London “Daily
Mirror” group), and 20 percent by the
Transport Development Group (which
has moved so solidly into the Australian
road transport industry through some
major takeovers). The local Industrial
and Trade Fairs company is jointly
owned by this group and Australian
Consolidated Press.
Exhibition Promotions, owned by
the Thomson newspaper group, recently
had an engineering exhibition in Syd-
ney and i« now running a clothing
machinery exhibition.
These British experts are not muck-
ing about in this market; they clearly
mean business and
have sent top men
out here to run
things. Leslie Smith,
who came from the
British company to
become managing
director of the local
Indus trial and
Trade Fairs com-
pany, is a 42-year-
old economics
graduate and
former RAF navi-
gator who has spent the past 12 years
in this business. Two of his major
operations were running British trade
fairs in Moscow and Peking.
Leslie Smith’s organisation is now
working on the 1967 Ideal Homes Ex-
hibition and the 1967 International
Trade Fair, but he is also preparing
Australian export fairs in Singapore,
Kuala Lumpur, and Hong Kong on
behalf of the Department of Trade.
CARLTON and United Breweries’
74-year-old Queensland-born Sir
Reginald Fogarty has gate-
crashed a number of beer gardens be-
yond the group’s exclusive Victorian
bar in his time, so it’s only rough justice
that he’s now to be bearded there by a
strong competitive force. With a wealth
of Courage behind him, British Tobacco
king Tom Foley has shrewdly found
Sir R. Fogarty.
Sir M. Nathan.
Leslie Smith.
local public leviathan Sir Maurice
Nathan to chair the assault.
Sir Maurice has been many things
in Melbourne public life and business
in his 52 years, but he has never been
a brewer before. Two useful years as
Lord Mayor—he is still on the City
Council—coupled with good works for
the Brotherhood of St. Lawrence and
as founder and continuing chairman of
the Victorian Promotion Committee,
brought him the expected accplade three
years ago.
Running the long-established family
furniture business, Patersons Australia
Ltd., appears never to have exhausted
Nathan’s energies—not that its results
have ever been much more than mar-
ginal. He is always looking for new
outside outlets for his energies, such as
promoting world fairs and pressing ior,
an ever brighter spot for Melbourne.


from a rate of sll9om. annually to $ 1050 m. If the approvals
figures are any guide, there are more declines in the pipe-
line for next year.
None of this is the least surprising. Capital expenditure
has been at boom levels for two years, and the long stag-
nation of sales and production has undermined the basis
for continued expansion of capacity. We may hope for
sales to leap ahead now, or the economy will be in trouble.
Concern among Bankers
IF the Government is unconcerned about the state of the
economy (or, as Croesus suggests, is just waiting for
Sir Roland Wilson’s departure before taking a kinder
view) the trading banks are getting quite disturbed. And they
are the people who talk to businessmen.
The National Bank of Australasia, in its latest Summary
of Australian business conditions, says that, over the past
year, there has been a temptation to regard the familiar, tell-
tale indicators of generally depressed share prices, lack of
buoyancy in retail trading, and reduced levels of output in
substantial areas of private industry as counterbalances to
other, more active influences such as mineral development
and increased expenditure on the Government side. For a
surprisingly long time, all this, together with a tightening
squeeze on busines profits, ran hand in glove with a gener-
ally healthy expansion of capital expenditure. However, it
now seems that this paradox has ended and that important
segments of the business world are making a less optimistic
assessment of the immediate future.
The trouble lies not in any lack of credit facilities, the
bank believes, rather in that capital expansion has been
halted and this has abetted a general weakening in consumer
spending which is now spreading back to the productive
process.
Playing the Meat Markets
IT’S just as well that US demand for Australian manu-
facturing beef is going up so well after all the fuss
of a few years ago. Otherwise Australian meat exporters,
already buffeted by the drought, would be finding things most
uncomfortable now that their British trade has been so
violently disrupted largely because of the Common
Market’s tariff changes.
While British meat prices (particularly for beef) have
collapsed, with prices for Australian boneless ox rumps
down 25 percent on last year, the US market has gone ahead
well, with boneless manufacturing grades up about 13 per-
cent over the last year—and much of this meat comes from
tropical areas that were not as badly dealt with in the
drought as the sheep areas of N.S.W.
But while beef exporters can make the most of the US
market (and while cattle supplies are too short anyway to
worry too much about fighting for a slice of the now dif-
ficult UK market), the fat lamb men have been faced,
ironically, with a spring lamb glut—Britain, usually a big
customer for Australian lamb, is not buying much while
it can get beef so cheaply, and lamb prices are down 12
percent or so. And the good season this year has meant that
lamb killing in Australia has been at a high rate; 2.55 million
head were slaughtered in August compared with 2.28 million
the previous August.
British meat prices are expected to continue low until the
seasonal rise after Christmas. The major reason appears to
have been the impact of April’s Common Market tariff
change that effectively increased the price of cattle imported
into the EEC by 40 percent, so wiping out a substantial ex-
port business from Ireland (and from Britain, too). So the
Irish are dumping their beef in Britain. In addition, the
Argentine has once again become a large exporter to Britain,
so it seems that unless the Common Market countries ease
their regulations, the British market could be a difficult
one for some time to come.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: October exports, at $244.1m.,
exceeded imports of $226.5m. by $17.6m.; the previous
October, 1965, had shown a $12.2m. trading deficit. Ex-
ports have been above s24om. in each of the last three
months . . . N.S.W. mine production in 1965 was valued
at a record $267.7m., $34.4m. higher than for 1964; coal
and silver-lead-zinc helped the increase most . . . The
Wheat Board expects no trouble in selling what should
be a peak 1966-67 harvest; the week saw its biggest sale
to Communist China—l£ million tons, with an optional
10 percent margin.
Trading banks averaged $24.3m. a week of overdraft
lending in the three months ended October, or 28 per-
cent more than for the corresponding 1965 period;
limits on October 12 stood at $4173.1m. . . . Retail
sales totalled $551.5m. in September, $3.2m. better than
August and s2Bm. more than in September, 1965.
Actual oil drilling in Australia has dropped consider-
ably, although geological and geophysical exploration
remains vigorous . . . The Asian Development Bank be-
gins its operations on December 19.
For the markets: Investors continue to view
Australian share markets very indifferently, so dealings
remain rather muted on reduced turnovers. Staidness
extends to the leaders, which move haphazardly and
offer no trend. The week’s overall industrial retreat
certainly looked slight; in the more favored minerals
section, movements also are mostly narrow.
Once more London/ found its principal attraction in
fixed interests as equities hit their lowest level in four
years. The “reverse yield gap” has vanished and
economic uncertainties call the tune . . . Wall Street
managed to go up a little at the end, mainly on the
unlikelihood of a tax increase.
For companies: Beer and gas (separately) top-
ped off the week . . . British Tobacco (Aust.) and the
UK’s Courage, Barclay and Simonds will assault Carlton
and United Breweries’ Victorian monopoly by building a
s6m. brewery at Broadmeadows, to begin distribution
in 1968. The joint company is aptly named Courage
Breweries Ltd. . . . Australia’s initial contract to supply
natural gas has been achieved by Delhi-Santos, which
is to pipe from its Gidgealpa-Moomba field to Ade-
laide’s South Australian Gas Co.; the contract’s term is
20 years and first supplies should enter Adelaide early
in 1969 . . . Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil expects to
drill its first offshore well at Golden Beach late in 1966
or early in 1967; a five cent call is made on all con-
tributing shares . . . Esso-BHP’s Marlin B 1 offshore well
has produced gas at a six million cubic feet a day rate.
Still on the oil front, British Petroleum Co. of Aust.
more than halved its profit, to $1,732,156, putting most
of the blame on the costly use of Australian flag tankers
. . . H. C. Sleigh lifted sales of petroleum products
“slightly” in the three months to September . . . Sales
of CSRC-Dow Pty. dropped back during the year to
June, so profits plunged from $183,301 to $7,168; the
group manufactures styrene monomer, polystyrene
resins, chlorine, and ethylene dichloride.
As usual the miners did not hide from the news . . .
Consolidated Gold Fields Australia’s public issue (five
million $1 shares at $2.50) closed after a formal minute,
“substantially oversubscribed” ... In 1965-66 Mount
Isa Mines achieved metal sales of $72.5m. —a 60 percent
jump on 1964-65 ... In its latest (1965-66) year, EZ
Industries succeeded in selling 12,929 tons of zinc (pre-
viously 1000 tons) to America, thus making up for a big
fall in sales to India . . . North Australian Uranium
Corporation pays a first, 5 percent, dividend, mainly as a
result of an accession of liquidity after sale of NAUC’s
share of Mount Cleveland . . . About half its Cleveland
Tin shareholding was sold off the market by Metals
Exploration; the rest had gone to shareholders.

ELDER SMITH
GOLDSBOROUGH MORT LIMITED
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
Tuesday, 1st November, 1966
ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN,
THE RT. HON. SIR PHILIP McBRIDE, K.C.M.G.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Directors’ Report will already
have told you how your Company fared
during the year under review.
One of the worst droughts in our his-
tory has made serious impact on the
States of N.S.W. and Queensland. I
stressed the seriousness of this when
addressing you last year, and indicated
the extent to which it must adversely
affect the business and earnings of com-
panies like ours. I also expressed concern
at the abruptness with which the Spring
had cut out in S.A. and Victoria, with
consequent effect on crops and pasture.
In view of the extent to which the
drought did continue in N.S.W. and on
the long, dry Spring, Summer, and
Autumn experienced in S.A. and Vic-
toria, we were agreeably surprised to
see, as the year progressed, that results
would exceed our expectations.
An after-tax profit only 2.6 percent
lower than the previous year reflects the
benefit of activities which are more
diversified than those of most others of
our kind, and, perhaps, a more favorable
geographical spread of our interests.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE
ACCOUNTS
Our turnover of $541,015,000 exceeded
the previous year by $2,976,000, but, as
the result of drought and its effect on
sales of wool, livestock, merchandise, and
property in N.S.W. and Queensland, and
on the production from our own stations,
the total was $30,255,000 below our
record of $571,270,000.
Shareholders’ Funds have increased by
$3,164,591 to $69,246,276. This means
that you, the Shareholders, own all your
Fixed Assets, Investments, and Merchan-
dise Stocks ($40,818,147), with sufficient
to spare to enable $28,428,129 of your
own funds to carry the whole of the
Company’s Trade Debtors and Bills Re-
ceivable, and an appreciable part of the
advances to rural clients. Reserves in-
creased by $3,164,593 to $48,846,276.
Although not under the same extreme
pressure to meet clients’ needs for ad-
vances as in the previous year, our out-
standings were at a high level at
$81,749,126.
Current Assets at $119,300,855 provide
a wide margin of $53,437,835 over Cur-
rent Liabilities and Provisions of
$65,863,020. As to our liquidity, short-
term deposits, cash, and public securities
in Current Assets at 30th June, totalled
$31,802,951.
In arriving at the year’s profit of
$5,238,166 (after tax) we maintained
our conservative approach to prudent
provisions and to rates of depreciation for
all Fixed Assets. Our Investments stood
in the books at $1,703,149 less than their
“market” value.
The extent of Shareholders’ Funds em-
ployed seems often to be overlooked when
viewing profits of large companies. While
our profit of $5,238,166 represents a
return of 21.8 percent on Issued Capital
of $24,000,000, it represents only 7.56
percent on Shareholders’ Funds of
$69,246,276.
The year’s profit represented a net
earning (after tax) of only .97 of one
percent on our $541,015,000 of turnover.
In our industry, a huge volume of busi-
ness must be transacted to make possible
a reasonable return on the large amount
of funds employed.
RURAL FINANCE
Last year we were very concerned
about the financial problems facing the
rural export industries. We, and all the
other Pastoral Houses, were experiencing
severe pressure from clients for carry-on
funds, drought fodder, and other relief,
and, in the more favored areas, for
essential development to increase produc-
tivity.
Advances by the twenty-three Aus-
tralian Pastoral Houses reached the un-
precedented level of $273,600,000. At one
stage they were $44.4 million higher
than at the same period in the previous
year.
It was a relief that the Federal Gov-
ernment, the Reserve Bank, and the State
Governments of drought stricken N.S.W.
and Queensland, did finally come to grips
with the problem.
State Drought Relief Funds came into
existence in the two drought-affected
States. The Reserve Bank made sub-
stantial releases to the Banks from Statu-
tory Deposits, thus better enabling them
to help rural customers, while the Com-
monwealth Development Bank rendered
considerable assistance in the area of de-
velopment for increased production.
Finally the Federal Government took
the unprecedented step of arranging a
special and substantial release from Statu-
tory Deposits to the Banks, to create a
new rural lending source the “Farm
Loan Development Fund” with initial
resources of $5O million.
I stress the word “initial” because
both the Prime Minister and the
Treasurer implied in their statements, at
the time, that this new source of rural
finance aimed to meet medium and long-
term development needs beyond the
shorter periods usually applicable to the
Banks’ “Term Loan Funds” a start to
meet a need, rather than a first and final
dealing with it.
It is important that the Government
be clearly mindful of the needs of the
rural primary industries, if they are to
meet constantly rising costs and fulfil
their important role of continually adding
to our export income.
The net result of all that has taken
place is that Trading Banks and Pastoral
Houses have been relieved in the more
serious aspects of rural finance pressure,
and so have been enabled to carry out
their more normal roles.
RURAL DEVELOPMENT
There are so many aspects of the sub-
ject of rural development and produc-
tivity, and their part in providing es-
sential export income, that I cannot
attempt to cover this subject at any
depth.
I become disturbed, however, when I
read what, to me, are irresponsible utter-
ances by those who should know better,
in criticism of what they choose to des-
cribe, cynically, as “more hand-outs for
the rural sector.”
Generally speaking, the rural primary
industries provide the great bulk of the
export income which, with the help of
capital inflow, meets our costly bill for
imports and the heavy annual outgo
of “invisibles.”
In producing for export, the primary
producer faces the inexorable annual rise
in costs, which he is not responsible for
creating. He does not enjoy the benefits
and amenities of the cities, in which ever-
increasing wages are being spent. The
prices he pays for his commodities and
services are higher because of distance
and internal transport costs. Under
almost all headings, he pays more for his
daily needs than those who complain
about what they choose to call “hand-
outs.”
Then, too, he lives with the constant
variables of drought, lean seasons, flood,
bushfire and animal and plant pests. He
must then sell the result of his effort at
world prices on world markets, as they
fluctuate year by year.
Let the critics compare the increase
in rural primary production over the last
ten years with that in other areas of
production: they will find much to praise
the farmer and grazier for, and little
to justify unwarranted criticism.
, It would be far more constructive to
adopt the positive and forward-looking
view that every action within Australia’s
financial means should be taken to en-
sure that development of new land, in-
creased production from established land,
increased scientific research, advanced
technical improvement, and equipment,
increased education and field service to
implement the result of research, are
encouraged and financially assisted
wherever it is economically sensible to do
so.
Only by these means, already highly
applied, in the world’s older and more


fully industrialised countries, will we
finance the import needs of our major
industrialised cities as populations ex-
pand.
We have the land, the climate, the
energetic and enterprising people, the
scientific backing, the technical skills
and a high level of productive ability.
Let us encourage them all and use them
to the full.
OVERSEAS CAPITAL
Nowadays, much is written in
criticism of the extent to which we are
allowing foreign capital to flow into in-
vestment in Australian industry and
commerce. Much is also written which,
by implication, emphasises the need to
maintain the inflow of imports essential
to fast growth of Australia’s develop-
ment.
The growth of industries capable of
ensuring employment for what needs to
be a fast-growing population, will in-
evitably mean a steady annual increase
in imports.
It follows, surely, that the same em-
phasis should be placed on the expanded
production of those of our export in-
dustries capable of greatest and quickest
increase.
It is my view that we will need all
the productive capital inflow that we
can get, and a very substantial increase
in our exports, as well, to fo6t future
import bills and maintain a sound bal-
ance-of-payments position.
Every under-developed and develop-
ing country has need to import capital.
Doubtless, all of them will receive it
to some degree, but those in which the
economic, political, and profit potential
prospects are greatest, are more likely
to benefit than others.
Australia offers attraction to overseas
investors under all headings and, there-
fore, will doubtless continue to benefit
from capital inflow. Nevertheless, the
restrictions on capital export which are
now found necessary by Great Britain
and other countries, and even U.S.A.,
make clear that we should not allow
ourselves to become over-dependent on
too high a rate of inflow.
I do not imply that we should not
develop as much of our natural poten-
tial as we can within Australia and
with our own resources. We should
marshal these resources with appropri-
ate priorities, in order to do so to the
greatest degree possible. However; no
matter what we may be able to achieve
in this manner, we will not, in my
view, be able to do without a continual
supply of overseas funds, if we are to
develop at the rate which our urgent
need for population demands.
EXPORT INCENTIVE
A major challenge to Australian
effort and ingenuity is that of reduc-
ing our reliance on overseas funds, to
the greatest possible degree, by increas-
ing exports. To do so, we should apply
all the funds we can economically afford
to the provision of adequate export in-
centives to all industries capable of find-
ing adequately profitable > outlets in
world markets.
We have seen what export incentives
have done to step up overseas sales of
Australian manufactured goods, despite
continual increase in our internal costs,
which make our exports of this type more
difficult to sell. Nevertheless, good though
results have been, the contribution of
manufactured goods to our total exports
remains, and is likely to remain, com-
paratively small in the total picture, for
many years.
While it is to the rural primary in-
dustries that we must continue to look,
our other enormous primary resources of
iron ore, coal, bauxite, nickel, gold,
copper, zinc, lead, oil, gas, etc., are now
beginning to show what the years ahead
will bring in overseas funds and savings
of imports.
However, we must not overlook the
fact- that we will need all the additional
income that our rural primary industries
can earn for us. This is likely to apply
as far ahead as any of us can at present
see, as the world population explosion
continues and world food needs increase.
We have the rural resources and in-
creased production potential. What is
even more important is that every extra
bale, case, or bushel of rural produce
represents an increase in export, because
we already meet all our own internal
needs.
What is needed are the incentives to
protect what we have, and to produce
and export more. I believe that we should
increase tax deduction incentives, with
the deliberate aim of encouraging greater
expenditure on every farm for the in-
creased conservation of water and fodder.
The recent drought has impressed these
needs on us, but they apply also in lean
seasons, which occur with greater fre-
quency than droughts.
Apart from the development of new
land, we must aim to increase significantly
the productivity of every already-
developed acre. This will mean increasing
livestock-carrying capacity and yields
from crops of all kinds.
Full land usage will entail increased
mechanisation and subdivisional fencing.
In this latter respect, I was interested to
read of the Government’s Budget in-
clusion of increased tax benefit for
fencing for prevention of soil erosion.
This is only part of the need, so far as
fencing is concerned, and the benefit
should be extended to all internal sub-
divisional fencing.
Combine the fencing aspects with those
I have mentioned in respect of water and
fodder conservation and it is my belief
that real incentives will bring the in-
creased exports which will justify the cost
with handsome returns.
RISING COSTS
Last year, I mentioned, optimistically
it now appears, that I thought the Arbi-
tration Court’s decision on wages revealed
awareness of the impact of its rulings
on Australia’s ability to live within her
means, and her need to be able to com-
pete for exports on world markets.
The 1965 decision, and subsequent
general economic conditions, brought a
reasonable degree of increase in wages
and other costs. As our Accounts reveal,
we were able to contain costs by im-
proved methods, mechanisation, and more
effective controls.
Disposal of Surplus Assets assisted in
controlling our outgo in property costs.
The principal increases in the general
expenses of the business were interest and
non-recurring costs of conversion to deci-
mal currency.
The current year’s prospects for con-
taining costs are not as bright. The in-
flationary effects of the Court’s excessive
$2 increase in the basic wage, and the
indication of a substantial, consequential
increase in margins, in the near future,
are clear to industry, to State Govern-
ments and all other authorities.
So clear is it that, almost immediately
in the wake of the decision, a wholesale
splurge of cost increases has taken place
almost across the board” and our
costs, will inevitably reflect this substanti-
ally in the current year.
The man on the land now faces in-
creased costs under almost every heading
associated with him costs of fertiliser,
sea and rail freights, road transport, rates,
land and other taxes, and costs of the
wide range of goods and services which
he needs.
THE WOOL INDUSTRY
The first half of the year found the
industry absorbed with its own inter-
nal problems, and this continued until
the Reserve Price Plan Referendum was
held. The result is now history a
majority of growers voted against the
plan, although it was favored in a
majority of States.
I have frequently referred to the
need for maximum unanimity of industry
view, if wool’s very important voice is
to be heeded by Government, and its
future secured. Now that the heat, which
the referendum engendered, has died
down, it does seem that there is grow-
ing realisation of the need, for a strong
and unified approach to important in-
dustry matters.
There are still strongly held and di-
vergent views, but there does seem to be
increasing acceptance of the fact that,
until general agreement can be reached
between grower bodies about the in-
dustry’s more important problems, pro-
gress cannot be made towards their
solution.
There has been too much loose talk
about what is repetitively generalised
as the “deficiencies” of the present
marketing system. In fact, and so far
as the reference is to actual auction-
selling, most of the many points listed
as “deficiencies” have already been ironed
out and corrected.
Those that remain are primarily ones
for which growers themselves must pro-
vide the solution. A commonsense apr
proach is being made to these by the
bringing together of representatives of
grower bodies, woolbrokers, and buyers,
to work in concert with the Wool Board
or its Marketing Committee.
This has been achieved by the Wool
Board’s decision to form what are known
in the industry as two “ad hoc com-
mittees.” Their. respective tasks are im-
portant, and it is hoped that they can
be accomplished with speed and general
acceptance.
One Committee, including Wool Board
appointees from grower, woolbroker, and
buyer organisations, is examining all
aspects concerned with the complex sub-
ject of the “private selling” of wool.
The other, made up of another selec-
tion of individual Wool Board appointees,
is representative of the same organisa-
tions, plus the “repacking” side of the
industry. The terms of reference for this
committee cover the vexed questions of
“one bale lots,” “bulkclassing,” and “clip
preparation.”
Growers await the recommendations of

■these committees, and much will depend,
finally, on the degree of industry accept-
ance of whatever does emerge. One thing
seems certain, and that is that the Federal
Government is not likely to take any
necessary action in respect of the Wool
Industry unless it can be shown that the
real weight of the industry is solidly
behind whatever its Wool Board may
bring forward.
MARKETS AND PRICES
Despite the national decline of 418,750
bales of wool sold by auction, proceeds
fell by only $27,117,000. This reflected
the fact that prices improved steadily,
but materially, as the selling season pro-
gressed, and, after a worrying start, the
improved levels resulted in the year’s
average being higher than in the 1965
year.
The drop in receipts into Woolbrokers’
Stores, from 5,089,700 to 4,510,000 bales,
was a serious one, giving some idea of the
enormity of sheep losses in N.S.W. and
Queensland, bearing in mind that the
other four States either held their own or
recorded increases.
The decline of 13,800,000 in Aus-
tralia’s sheep numbers will reflect in
future wool clips for some years to come,
for it will take many years for the two
drought-affected States to recover their
loss of over 17,000,000 sheep.
The official preliminary forecast that
this year’s total production will fall by
only 9.5 million lbs. from the 1,640 mil-
lion lbs. of 1965-66, and the auction total
by only some one percent, seems opti-
mistic to me. It doubtless takes into ac-
count the effects of drought and drought
relief in the affected States, but I wonder
whether sufficient allowance has been
made for the early cut-off of last year’s
Spring, and the subsequent long, dry
period which followed in the other States.
The 1966-67 wool selling season re-
sumed towards the end of August, and
opening prices were equal to July rates,
with competition strong for all types.
A weakening of demand soon appeared
for all but the • finer types of merino
which remained relatively unaffected.
By the third week in October, prices
for medium and broad merinos had
declined by percent, crossbreds
by 17i percent, and carding wools by
12i percent.
At this point of time, it seems evident
that problems of finance are affecting
Britain’s operations in the market, and
competition from U.S.A. is not as keen
as last year.
Japan continues to dominate the scene
at the lower basis, but her buyers are
displaying caution, when bidding for wool
showing the effects of the prolonged
drought in N.S.W. and Queensland.
Livestock values held over the full
year at satisfactory levels, when account
is taken of the varying influences of
drought, relief rains and the disappoint-
ing spring, as they affected States dif-
ferently.
Cattle prices overall advanced sub-
stantially over the year probably as
much as 17-J percent. The effects of
strong export demand and high internal
needs, related to reduced drought-
affected availability, inevitably spelt
higher prices.
Sheep prices, on the other hand, would
barely have held their own in fact,
Australian averages would reveal a slight
easing over the year.
In N.S.W., prices eased as drought per-
sisted in 1965, and only when 1966
winter rains brought relief was there
any improvement. Queensland benefited
from summer rain drought relief, and
low values, previously ruling, quickly
improved.
In the other States,. Victoria and S.A.
felt the downward price reaction, which
was natural, when good spring rains
failed to eventuate. Below-average winter
rains steadied prices during the balance
of the year.
In W.A., the extravagant values ruling
in 1965-66 could not have held economi-
cally, and there was an expected down-
turn. Nevertheless, prices in that State
are still higher than elsewhere in Aus-
tralia a reflection of the extreme
shortage in that fast-developing State.
All in all, rural land values have held
up well, though sales were restricted in
volume owing to buyers’ difficulties in
arranging long-term finance.
THE SEASON
A year ago seasonal prospects were not
bright. Large areas of Australia were
seriously drought-affected and the Spring
had closed off sharply in Victoria and
S.A.
This year it is pleasing that conditions
throughout most of the Continent present
sp much more favorable a picture. Most
drought areas have had at least some
relief, and a big grain harvest is antici-
pated in all States.
In W.A. the Agricultural areas promise
another good season; general rains in
September, and again in October, have
consolidated grain and feed prospects.
In the Pastoral Areas conditions vary.
Parts of West Kimberley and the Ash-
burton are particularly dry, while from
Carnarvon to the North-West Cape, and
the North-East Gascoyne, near-drought
conditions prevail.
In S.A. we have had a much better
year. The Agricultural areas, with the
exception of the Murray Mallee, seem
assured of a good season and grain pros-
pects are sound. In the Mallee, drought
conditions prevail outside “Goyder’s
Line,” with the remainder of the area
in only fair to poor order.
Alice Springs is in excellent heart and
conditions in the North-West and through
the Gawler Ranges vary from average to
very good. In the North and North-East
of the State, however, conditions are very
dry and good soaking rains are very
badly needed.
Most of Victoria received above-normal
rains during September and further fairly
general falls in October. Prospects in the
Wimmera and Mallee are now much
improved. The rest of the State is experi-
encing a very good season.
In N.S.W. there has been a marked
improvement since mid-Winter. Very
good rains fell over some three-quarters
of the State in August and September,
with many areas benefiting further in
October. The South-West corner has not
been so fortunate and relief is still
anxiously awaited there.
Wheat prospects are now most en-
couraging and feed growth is satisfac-
tory throughout most of the State, except
in the South-West quarter. Although
pastoral conditions are generally much
improved, heavy falls are needed to re-
plenish many of the State’s major dam
and river systems.
Above-average rains, of a general and
soaking nature, fell over most of
Queensland in August. Further useful
storms fell in September and October—
particularly in the South of the State.
A good Spring has given promise of
outstanding grain prospects in the Agri-
cultural areas.
Apart from isolated locations, includ-
ing the area North of the Flinders River,
which remains dry, the season in Queens-
land is now promising.
APPRECIATION
The Directors expressed their appreci-
ation of the outstanding efforts of our
Management and Staff during the past
year, in their Annual Report.
I would like, now, to add to the
Board’s expressions by speaking on be-
half of you as the Shareholders. We are
extremely fortunate to be supported by
a Management and Staff dedicated to
Elders-GM, and working so efficiently
and enthusiastically for its advancement.
On your behalf, I pay tribute to their
team-work and loyalty.
I pay tribute, also, to the whole-
hearted support which I have received
from the Deputy Chairman, Mr. J. N.
McEwin, our fellow Directors, the
Directors of State Advisory Boards and
of Subsidiary Companies, and I thank
them for giving so fully of their time,
and for their enthusiastic interest in
the Company’s well-being.
I make these expressions of appreci-
ation and thanks with emphasis and
deep feeling, on this occasion, for it
will be my last opportunity to do so as
your Chairman, and as a Director of
our great Company.
After a lifetime of association with the
Company as a client" after what will be
27 years of membership of the Boards
of Elders and of Elders-GM since in-
corporation four years ago (interrupted
by the years when my Ministerial duties
in the Federal Government precluded me
from such office) the time approaches
when, under the requirements of our
Articles of Association, I will reach re-
tiring age.
I will retire at 30th June next, so far
as your Board is concerned but not,
I add, as a friend, supporter, client, and
shareholder.
CLIENTS
It has always been my practice, in
concluding my Address to you, to express
appreciation to the Company’s Clients
wherever they may be in all States of
Australia.
This appreciation, which I express on
behalf of the Board, Management, and
Staff, goes to all our Clients who have
so loyally supported us during the year.
We look forward to continued association
with them in the years ahead.

PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
Labor and the Treasury
WHERE’S the money coming
from” has been a frequent jibe
at the Labor Party’s ambitious
election promises in past campaigns.
And probably the jibe has worked,
arousing the scepticism of Australian
voters. But the way things are shaping
up this year the Government is going
to have a harder job in discrediting
Opposition proposals for expanded
social services, more money for educa-
tion, health, and northern development.
A week ago the ALP’s Federal secre-
tariat put out a five-page screed en-
titled “How Labor Will Pay.” By-lined
to Mr. Calwell, though obviously not
written by him, it says that Labor’s
program will cost an extra s3oom. Be-
yond that it is a rather laborious,
esoterically worded argument that this
is a small amount, which need not
necessarily mean increased taxes. It
compares the proposed s3oom. with the
s6oom. by which the Government in-
creased spending in the last Budget.
The ALP will find expert economic
support for the proposition that this
need not mean any immediate increased
taxation, since such a program could,
in present conditions of economic slack,
be introduced as a bit of pump-priming.
But, in an economy which over the
years seesaws between mild unemploy-
ment and mild inflation, pumps have to
be de-primed occasionally, too. So such
a scheme could only postpone, not elim-
inate, the need for higher taxation. And
the raising of s3oom. would need a
battery of tax increases a little bigger
than those of the 1965 Budget—when
income and company taxes, cigarettes,
TV licence fees, and postal charges
went up. Of course people put up with
those.
This time, at least, there’s not likely
to be a repetition of last election’s
dreary argument over how much
Labor’s election proposals will really
cost. Labor MPs, Whitlam and Patter-
son particularly, have been hard at
work over the past six months gathering
detailed information from Government
departments on the cost of various pro-
jects. They have done this via the
medium of questions on the parliamen-
tary notice paper. It looks as though
they will be able to say that most of
their costing has been done by the Gov-
ernment itself!
THERE’S all sorts of speculation
about the reshuffles which are
currently occurring in the
Treasury. Sir Roland Wilson’s transfer
to Qantas, Mr. L. B. Hamilton’s shift
to Social Services, and Mr. C. Hewitt’s
appointment as new head of the
Universities Commission have left
vacancies and a chain of promotions in
their wake. Sir Richard Randall,
formerly a deputy secretary with Mr.
Hewitt, was always a step ahead. He
was in charge of the more powerful
policy-making sections of the depart-
ment and stood in for Sir Roland in
his absence. So it was no surprise when
he was promoted to the head position.
And, with his rivalry with Mr. Hewitt
so intense, it did not surprise many
people here when Sir Richard’s suc-
cession was delayed until after Mr.
Hewitt had been officially appointed to
the AUC.
Lacking Wilson’s intense cunning, Sir
Richard is said to be nevertheless a
powerful character, and personable and
very competent, too. Mr. Hewitt has
always been pictured as something of an
ogre, epitomising the ruthless Treasury
man dedicated to saving taxpayers’
money. That has been his job and in
it he has displayed a computer-like
memory for embarrassing facts and a
devastating barrister’s ability to probe
for inconsistencies. The academics are
not looking forward to having him,
though people who know the chaotic
state of universities’ administration may
judge that his abilities are likely to
produce greater educational value for
public money in the years ahead, even
though he will be a great loss to the
Public Service.
Mr. Maurie O’Donnell - “a real
gentleman” is tipped as the successor
to Sir Richard as senior deputy secret-
ary of the Treasury. Formerly first
assistant secretary in charge of th.e
glamor “financial and economic policy”
section, he is at present in Washington
representing Australia on the boards of
the IMF and the World Bank. There
are no hot favorites for Mr. Hewitt’s
old job, though someone (outside the
Treasury, I should say) tells jne that
Mr. J. Garland is a good bet.


Sir Roland Steps Down
By CROESUS
THE stratosphere where economic
policy is made will never be the
same again, nor probably ever
seem so unworldly, now Sir Roland
Wilson, the Secretary of the Federal
Treasury these past 15J years, is des-
cending for good to the Elysian fields
of Government corporations.
I’d better say straight away that Sir
Roland has done a magnificent job at
the Treasury. Every man Jack of us is
in his debt. His critics, including myself
at times, can’t deny the full merit of
the achievement in keeping the Aus-
tralian economy at full employment
with only by pre-war standards,
anyway three minor interruptions
throughout his period of office.
When we consider that Wilson, the
economist, was reared in the pre-
Keynsian era, when it was taught that
domestic economies had to dance un-
flinchingly to the tune of the balance
of payments, we find the true measure
of’ his great capacities for mental ad-
justment to modern economic philoso-
phies and requirements. It is just as
weiU for Australia he remembered his
early lessons, but it’s been even more
important for us that he has absorbed
the new ones.
In seeking a compromise between
the old and the new, it would appear
in retrospect that, in the broad, Wilson
found the answer in trying to make the
balance of payments less a master, more
a servant, of the employment situation.
His aim all along appeared to be to
avoid a situation where weakness in the
balance of payments had inevitably to
limit internal economic activity, but to
recognise, also, that in such a circum-
stance appropriate fiscal and monetary
restraints should not be shirked.
The exercise involved going flat out
to stiffen the balance of payments. If
on occasions the result has fallen short
of requirements, we can hardly blame
Wilson. He’s done his darndest to keep
open the door for overseas capital, has
courted the world’s big financial centres
for loans, and sought to hold Australia’s
import demand through fiscal and
monetary policy within appropriate
limits.
Talking through his political heads
(he has rarely ventured on to a public
platform himself), he has often warned
the Australian public that ours is an
open-ended economy whose balance of
payments is inevitably much at the
'mercy of world price fluctuations for
our big rural exports. Sometimes it may
have seemed to Cabinet Ministers and
others that Wilson saw himself as
Canute, but uncomplicated as he
undoubtedly thinks the Australian
economy to be, he never claimed to
be in control of the tides washing in
from abroad.
The long periods when Wilson let
the economy run on uninhibited were
applauded. The “stops” dictated by the
balance of payments brought a hail of
criticism. Wilson could keep an even
temperature on reverse turns in events,
and I believe there was only one ex-
ception to this throughout his secretary-
ship. That was in 1960, when he made
a serious miscalculation in allowing
economic activity to run on too hot
for too long and then had to super-
impose ultra-heavy restraints in an
eleventh-hour bid to correct the error.
If ever Sir Roland panicked during
his stay at the Treasury it was then.
To myself, the unanswered question
still is not whether the economic res-
traints imposed in November, 1960,
were untimely or even whether some
of them were ill advised. It is why, all
through 1960, Wilson failed to impress
on the Government that it was vital
to do something to check the rampant
speculative excesses undermining the
economy. Because it was patently obvi-
ous to most other people that sooner
or later balance of payments considera-
tions alone would call for a drastic cor-
rection.
has been written already
about the courses of correction, sucli
as the tax-on-interest, taken on the
Treasury’s advice in November, 1960.
We won’t go into that here, but it is
clear from the Government’s reluctance
to initiate recovery measures until
pushed into them by a big political re-
verse in December, 1961, that, instead
of nursing his own wounds in 1961, Sir
Roland should have been urging the
Government to take rather bolder eco-
nomic courses. The balance of payments
had staged a salutary recovery and one
would imagine he would have found
the Government, if only for political
reasons, most receptive.
It would be unjust if these blemishes
on an otherwise distinguished record
were over-emphasised. One only attrib-
utes them to Wilson and not to the
Government because it was only on
rare occasions that his advice was not
acted on. One can forgive politicians
for letting prosperity have its head.
But not permanent heads of Treasuries.
Their role, or one of them, is to recog-
nise economic trends, to advise courses
of action in relation to them, and to
impress on the Government the need to
take them.
Doubtless Sir Roland had his troubles
with the two Federal Treasurers in
office during most of his stewardship.
He may not have had all that time, in
the four months after his accession in
April, 1951, to put his stamp on the
1951-52 Budget, but the pattern of
that “horror” was highly orthodox. It
was probably at least condoned by Sir
Roland, who has subsequently not been
averse to the use of high taxation as a
dampener, if not exactly as a “mopping-
up” instrument as
Fadden purported
to use it in 1951.
Wilson soon got
to know and hu-
mor Fadden,
who, I believe,
was more prone
to override him
than Holt. I re-
member one fam-
ous occasion at a
Press conference
at the Savoy Hotel in London when,
after Fadden, in answer to a serious
question, declared that the economic
situation in Australia (January, 1952)
was “b . . . awful,” Wilson quickly in-
tervened to say that “what the Treasurer
really means is . . However Fadden
was soon back conducting the show.
Fadden played the political role much
more strongly than Holt on Treasury
matters and one always had the im-
pression that Wilson found him less
ready than Holt to speak the Treasury
brief. Sometimes this proved rather
disastrous, as when Fadden,, opening a
Commonwealth conference of statisti-
cians, had failed to find the speech Sir
Roland had prepared for him (Wilson
had put it under the wrong door at
the Hotel Canberra). Fadden spoke off
the cuff and turned the opening into
a circus. When Holt spoke to a Treas-
ury brief, as he usually did, he was
singularly ineffective. I guess Wilson
isn’t a good script writer.
Mr. McMahon has been so canny and
has said so little (strange for him)
since he took over the Treasury from
Mr. Holt that I’ve got the impression
he’s just been sitting these first few
months out until Sir Roland departs,
prepared to follow the cautious line
.the latter has followed pretty consist-
ently since his gaffes in 1960. I, for
one, expect Mr. McMahon to become
less inhibited when Wilson goes, that
is if he has the chance to after Novem-
ber 26.
I would also expect to see the Treas-
ury become more receptive of business
opinion. Unless you knew him pretty
well and few businessmen did
Wilson was a difficult man to talk to.
He hardly suffered fools at all, and
none gladly. He liked to live and work
far from the madding crowd, to retire
into his workshop, and take business
opinion and reactions as being highly
predictable. He will not be missed in
business circles because he was rarely
in them. He saw his role as permanent
head of the Treasury in the tradition
of his great counterparts in Whitehall,
aloof and authoritative. In stature he
was not behind any of them.
No wonder, then, that Wilson looked
with high suspicion on the suggestion
aired in the Vernon Report of some
alternative economic advisory body
being set up outside the Treasury, to
usurp, as it were, the authority he
has been exercising all these years.
Above all, he seemed to relish his
prerogative of power as the Govern-
ment’s chief economic adviser.

TH E foreign
invasion of
the Aus-
tralian food in-
dustry (Cottees
was the latest to
go) is not likely to
extend to one of
Australia’s fastest-
growing and big-
gest “little” com-
panies, privately
owned by Master-
foods Pty. Ltd.,
which last week
brought out its 150th product—a do-it-
yourself marmalade mix. And the three
Lewis brothers who run it (46-year-
old John as chairman and managing
director, 43-year-old Victor as pro-
duction director, and 37-year-old
David as research director) not only
intend to remain independent, they also
plan to keep adding to this list of items
that have to fight for space on super-
market shelves with so many products
of their big international rivals.
And they are not at all worried about
it. “Our products are the best, any-
way,” says John. Most are “gourmet”
foods, and they now produce about
three times as much as they import
(they are still major importers of exotic
foods), with output going up at an
average rate of 40 percent a year in the
past four years since moving to their
new Matraville factory.
Masterfood’s first product, developed
by Victor, was mustard; its most suc-
cessful are its “spreads”; its biggest
export is the kangaroo tail soup that it
invented (it is also doing well with a
clam soup). But it has kept right out
of the popular (and competitive) pro-
ducts like tomato sauce.
The brothers’ father, Henry Lewis,
started Masterfoods 40 years ago as a
food importer, an idea that developed
while he was running Victors fish shop
in Pitt Street, Sydney (which he owned
with his cousin), and began importing
exotic foods to go with the fish. Just
before his death in 1952 (he had long
since sold his Victor interest) John had
decided to go into manufacturing as
well as importing (import licensing was
severe then) and they converted an old
picture theatre at Redfern as their fac-
tory.
Now Masterfoods is in a large factory
at Matraville, financed in part by a
Commonwealth Development Bank loan
because of the company’s role not only
in replacing imports and even export-
ing 10 percent of its production but
also for developing the growing of the
farm products it uses. It has no plans
for going public—“unless we have to.”
THE former directors of Ready
Mixed Concrete Ltd., who were so
unhappy about the rapid expan-
sion of their British subsidiary that they
sold it (and thereby brought on the
takeover of their own operations), may
be feeling some justification by the
latest annual report of the British com-
pany (now the world’s biggest ready
.mixed concrete producer). This showed
that one reason for the poor result from
the group (with profit down 18 per-
cent) seems to have been its unsatisfac-
tory returns from international opera-
tions, not merely from the economic
downtrend in Britain. This is in contrast
to the experience of its rival, Pioneer
Concrete.
Britain is still the Readymix group’s
major market, providing 78 percent of
the group turnover despite the 55 per-
cent increase in international turnover
from its European, Israel, and Trinidad
operations that has lifted their share
of the business from 18.3 percent to 22
percent.
So it looks as if things will be tough
again this year for the group, as the
British economic squeeze continues to
have its impact. The annual report also
shows that its founding chairman, Mr.
Bryan Kelman, now has no official ties
at all with the company.

CAMBRIDGE CREDIT CORPORATION LIMITED
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS
DELIVERED AT 16th ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY
14th OCTOBER, 1966
Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is with pleasure that I again address you at this
the Sixteenth Annual General Meeting of Share-
holders.
As you will have noted already from the Annual
Report and Balance Sheet forwarded to you, the
Corporation continued to make progress during the
past financial year. A few figures concerning the
results achieved during the period may be of interest
to you.
FINANCIAL
This year has shown a continuation of the trend over
the past ten years and resulted in a marked increase
in gross profit. In comparison with the previous year,
the important relative figures are:
1965 1966
Gross Profit $611,342 $650,778
Less provision for tax 140,356 190,390
Net Profit 470,986 460,388
The net profit after tax represents an earning rate of
14.2% on shareholders' funds after providing for pre-
ference dividend of 9% on the preference share
capital of $400,000, being the first full year in which
such dividend was payable.
The increased tax provision was due largely to the
reduction in tax loss benefits, brought about by the
amendment of the Income Tax Act by the Govern-
ment, effective from 30th June, 1965. Your Directors
are pleased that their forecast of 14% earning rate
was exceeded for the year.
Your Directors have recommended payment of a
final dividend on the ordinary stock units at the rate
of 10% p.a. which will absorb $298,640, and they
recommend that $lOO,OOO be transferred to General
Reserve which will be increased to $735,400 by this
addition.
Your Directors have decided to create a Provision for
Doubtful Debts. An amount of $50,000 has been
transferred from the Profit & Loss Appropriation
Account for this purpose. In arriving at this decision,
your Directors wish to point out that they are
following current general practice. This provision is
not created to cover any specific bad debt or debts.
The Corporation's policy of writing off all known bad
debts has been adhered to during the period under
review.
NEW FUNDS
At 30th June, 1966, total debenture and unsecured
note borrowings amounted to $26,443,000.
Renewals of maturing securities have again indicated
the confidence of the Corporation's investors. When
renewing their investments with the Corporation,
many investors increased the amount of their invest-
ment.
On 30th September, this year, the number of Deben-
ture and Noteholders was 17,767 and ordinary and
preference shareholders numbered 4,293.
RECEIVABLES
Total receivables during the period increased by
$1,008,875 to $36,875,979. As will be noted from the
Balance Sheet, the greatest percentage of this
amount is invested in mortgages.
The Corporation is continuing to concentrate on this
type of security and it is expected the percentage
of mortgage receivables will be even greater at the
end of the current year.
Collections on receivables during the year under
review were well maintained and new business
transacted during the year exceeded $10,500,000.
REAL ESTATE
Your Corporation is also engaged in the buying and
selling of property and land. We have connections
with other financial institutions which are prepared
to co-operate with us in the financing of such
projects.
Your Directors investigate and examine each proposal
thoroughly and, where necessary, independent valu-
ations are obtained. In a number of cases, joint
ventures are entered into with other organisations
which provide technical advice and selling ability,
so that together and in conjunction with the financial
backing of institutions already mentioned, each
undertaking is assured of a profitable conclusion.
You will note from the photographs on your Balance
Sheet cover some of the recent successful projects
which your Corporation fias financed and you will, I
am sure, be pleased with the high standard of the
construction demonstrated by these illustrations.
APPROVED LENDER
Your Corporation was recently made an approved
lender by the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation,
a statutory authority established by the Common-
wealth Government. The Corporation has also been
accepted as an approved lender by the Mortgage
Guaranty Insurance Corporation of Australia Limited.
CONCLUSION
The activities of your Directors and the staff of the
Corporation are continuously directed towards sound,
solid progress for the Corporation.
During the past year this has been achieved by the
co-operation of all concerned and. your Directors
express their thanks for the loyalty and efficiency of
the staff and confidently look forward to continuing
such progress during the current financial year.
J. DEAN,
Chairman of Directors.

J. C. HORSFALL'S MELBOURNE
A Day in Carlton
THE ACTU’S seminar on prices last
week at least cleared the air on
one economic issue for the coming
Federal election. Obviously an over-
whelming majority of the Labor Party
in Victoria is as avidly in favor of
official price control as the Liberal-
Country Party is against it. The
question is what Mr. Calwell, who,
judging by his reasonable prospectus for
social services improvements, seems to
be swinging toward domestic issues
for his assault on the electorate, will
have to say about it in his policy speech.
At the seminar, Mr. Frank Crean,
the shadow Treasurer, gave a broad
hint that his leader might make a
central issue of price control. As he
said, “There’s a case in favor of the
view that prices should be allowed to
rise only after reference to a public
authority.” But to do this, he admitted,
might require constitutional change to
authorise such a body, and, anyway, a
government should give a clear indica-
tion of its intention to set up the neces-
sary machinery.
Is this an indication of intention
from the ALP? It could be. In the
meantime we have the position squarely
from the ACTU’S junior vice-president,
Mr. W. P. Evans. He told the seminar
that control of prices resided in the
Commonwealth and the States, but was
divided between the two in times of
peace. Notwithstanding this position,
it is possible to combine the powers
of the Commonwealth and the States
and confer them on a tribunal or tri-
bunals, as was done by agreement with
the N.S.W. coal industry. Mr. Evans
added that “non-Labor Commonwealth
and State Governments, who oppose
price control, were preventing such
agreements being reached.”
WHATEVER economists generally
think about price control Pro-
fessor Isaac, of Monash University, told
the Trades Hall meeting he was against
it except in periods of emergency,
mainly because of the costs and ineffici-
encies involved it is interesting to
reflect that in the 1948 referendum on
whether power should be granted to
the Commonwealth Government to con-
trol rents and prices (including
charges), of the 4,476,000 voting only
40.66 percent opted in favor and 59.34
were against it, that is about 3 to 2 in
the negative. All States voted against
the proposal by substantial margins, the
biggest being in Tasmania.
Would we get the same sort of result
today? The 1948 referendum was held
when people were fed up to the teeth
with controls that had been carried
on from the war for three years into the
peace on defence powers. A similar '
referendum held now could have a
rather different result.
If Labor wins the election it is on the
cards it would call for a referendum
on price control. If not, the trade
unions will obviously be looking to the
present Government to have a closer
look at some of the alternatives. Like
Frank Crean, I have been thinking for
a long time that the present squeeze on
incomes by prices will be accentuated
to the possible detriment of employ-
ment.
One of the alternatives posed to the
seminar by Professor Isaac was a volun-
tary arrangement which would throw
considerable responsibility on trade
unions and employers alike to get re-
straint on wages, profits, and prices.
Isaac said that this, in effect, was an
incomes policy which the Arbitration
Commission had the necessary set-up to
implement. Crean dissented strongly
on the Arbitration Commission’s pos-
sible role under its existing powers on
this and I quite agree with him. How-
ever, Isaac did admit that the Govern-
ment would probably have to help to
get restraint on the profits side.


WILD CAT
PACES
The Stock Market is Wrong!
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
THERE are plenty of men picking
up bumpers in Collins or O’Con-
nell Streets with a worn-out sand-
shoe on one foot and a down-at-heel
slipper on the other whose last words
have been: “The market was wrong.”
But there seems little doubt that last
week the market was clearly wrong on
at least three occasions.
The market, incontestably wrong in
pushing Broken Hill South shares up so
high, was probably wrong in knocking
Carlton and United Breweries so
heavily, and was severe in cutting the
price of Oil Drilling and Exploration.
THE Broken Hill South phosphate
find shows how over-excited the
market can get in situations that
warrant caution. The market got wind
that something was up in the week
before the announcement, when the
shares rose 12 cents from $2.63. After
it they jumped to a record $3.26
an overall rise of 63 cents on heavy,
turnover before subsiding back around
the $3 mark.
There are so many “ifs” and “buts”
about South’s phosphate rock find that
it will take a very long time indeed
before the deposit can be established as
economic and there is no guarantee
that even then it would provide huge
profits to the company. The suggestion
is, on the contrary, that as sojne sort
of Government subsidy would probably
be needed for the venture (even if it
were proved economic, which is has not
yet been), profit prospects would natur-
ally be limited.
The phosphate rock is reported as
being high grade. The exact words of
the discovery announcement by South’s
chairman, Mr. G. Lindesay Clark, are
important: “Intermittent outcrops have
been found over 15 miles of strike and
we don’t think the limit of the find has
been reached yet. The rock is 40 feet
thick at the present known thickest
point.
“The discovery is a very significant
development. But two or three years
must elapse before testing and prelimin-
ary work is completed.”
South are not the only company
to have discovered phosphate rock in
reasonable grades in Australia; Con-
tinental Oil has done so, but it has not
been in economic concentrations. And
that is only' one of the important things
South have yet to prove for their find
near Cloncurry. Another is to solve the
freight proble.ni.
If the average thickness of South’s
rock is about 30 feet, then for every
100 yards of its width over its 15-mile
estimated length there would be 40
million tons of ore. And if that were
ten percent phosphate, this would pro-
duce enough for only 18 months’ Aus-
tralian usage. It is, therefore, vital that
some idea of width also be established
before the market gets too excited about
it.
It is also intriguing that only ten days
before South’s bullish announcement the
director of fertiliser raw materials for
Continental Oil Co. of Australia, Mr.
Robert Arrington, who leads Contin-
ental’s search for rock phosphate here,
warned that the search would be “pro-
tracted, tedious, and unlikely to produce
spectacular results. It is hoped
that a marine environment (it is im-
portant for commercial accumulation
for sediments to be built up under
marine conditions) can be established
and lead to the discovery of commercial
phosphate bodies, but there are many
intangibles involved. We know phos-
phate minerals exist in various forma-
tions, but we do not know whether or
not we have a marine environment, and
there is a lot of evidence to suggest
otherwise.”
South have not yet said whether they
are convinced about these marine-
environment questions that are worrying
Continental so much in its search.
(Continental Oil is one of the biggest
fertiliser manufacturers in the U.S., and
is entering the final stages of its feasi-
bility studies for the establishment of
fertiliser plants in Australia.)
The freight problem is very import-
ant, although, if this is a really big
find, the foreign exchange considerations
(imports cost $lB million a year) could
prompt the Government to assist its
development in some way, probably
through freight assistance, quite apart
from the fact that the Nauru deposits
have a limited life. Rail freight charges
of 2c a ton mile to Townsville, 600
miles away, would give a freight charge
of $l2 a ton to start, which would leave
little chance for costs of mining and
treatment to be kept low enough for the
final product to be comparable with
world prices of around $lB a ton.
And as there is no nearby market, the
finished product would have to be
carried a long way. Alternatively, a
railway link with the Gulf of Carpen-
taria, 200 miles to the north, would
reduce rail transport costs appreciably
and the Government could assist here.
But low-grade phosphate rock has
been found in many areas, and hopes
that a deposit of high-grade rock may
be discovered nearer the coast could
limit the Government’s enthusiasm
about aiding South’s discovery in this
way at this stage.
PANIC sales of Carlton and United
Breweries “Z” shares, following
the widely forecast announcement
that British Tobacco was to join with
a British brewer to invade Victoria,
provide an excellent opportunity for
investment in this beer giant.
Tooth has two competitors for its
NSW sales and the market puts it on
a dividend yield of 3.1 percent and an
earnings yield of 4.4 percent (on its
disclosed figures); Carlton and United
Breweries have a potential competitor
who plans to invest about $ll million
in the business (Carlton’s fixed assets
alone are in the books at $6B million)
and on the strength of that, last week,
the market has put the shares down
another 30 cents to yield 4.4 percent on
The Chartist says:
BROKEN HILL SOUTH is a stock in a very promising technical situation
at present. The long-term trend shows that a rate of approximately 60
percent appreciation per annum was achieved from late 1962 until the
beginning of 1965. Prices fell to a low point of $2.00 following the break in
trend and the stock has managed to follow a slight 20 percent uptrend since June
breakout from the 1965/66 congestion zone. Although some short-term reaction
might be expected, the possibility exists of a rise to about the $4.80 level eventually.

PLANET OIL COMPANY N.L.
The Directors of PLANET OIL COMPANY N.L.
and its Subsidiary, PLANET MINING COM-
PANY PTY. LTD., advise that the following
announcement was made to the Australian
Stock Exchanges and Press on the 31st
October, 1966.
MOUNT ROBIN COPPER PORPHYRY
PROSPECT
The area of interest in the Mount Robin por-
phyry copper prospect in North-Eastern
Queensland has been shown by reconnais-
sance induced polarisation and geochemical
surveys to be much more extensive than
originally mapped on the surface. The surveys
are being carried out by McPhar Geophysics
Ltd., Toronto, Canada.
Initial results indicate the presence of dis-
seminated sulphide mineralisation thoughout
an area at least IV4 miles in length and at
least V 2 mile in width.
Within this area three definite induced polari-
sation anomalies of considerable size have
been outlined to date. These anomalies cor-
relate with zones indicated by geochemical
testing of soil samples which gave copper
values greater than six times normal back-
ground for this area.
A halo of lead, zinc and silver mineralisation
surrounding the copper mineralisation has’also
been outlined.
Drilling of the first of an initial programme of
three 500-ft. diamond drill holes will com-
mence in mid-November.
BALLARAT EAST GOLD FIELD
Arrangements are being made to drill the first
hole on the Ballarat East gold field at Black
Hill on the northern end of the field. Drilling
is expected to commence in December.
A target depth of 1500 feet is planned, with a
Dossible extension to 5000 feet.
PETERMANN RANGES
Further gossans have been discovered in the
Butler Dome area of the Petermann Ranges in
the Northern Territory extending the line of
known gossanous outcrops in this large base
metals prospect from five to seven miles.
Detailed structural mapping of the area has
now been completed. Drilling is planned for
early 1967.
PLANET OIL COMPANY N.L.

dividends and 7.6 percent on earnings.
They had already fallen $1.15 on the
prospect of this move.
Although the new rival is only seek-
ing a “proportion” of the market, it is
likely that the early days of competition
between CUB and Courage, when the
rival eventually gets going by 1968, may
be a bit hectic. But Carlton has known
of the coming threat for some time, has
prepared for it—and the threat is well
and truly over-discounted by prices as
low as 2.95 for the CUB’s shares.
THE news that more oil drilling rigs
were now idle than at any time
in the history of Autralia’s oil
search knocked 10 cents off the price
of oilfield equipment supplier and rig
hirer, Oil Drilling and Exploration Ltd.
At the end of October only 9 of the 41
rigs available were working or prepar-
ing to work.
Bad as this may look for ODE, the
facts are that four of ODE’s rigs are of
deep capacity (most of the holes now
being drilled are to greater depth)
and are therefore in demand. An-
other two are medium capacity and
the remaining five are shallow, but
some of these have been useful in the
Barrow Island area. In any event, in
the recent annual report directors said
that trading had been difficult because
of a decline in drilling activity yet
the company was able to maintain its
operating profit.
The consequent fall from 75 cents to
61 cents seemed to take this problem
(and the bonus issue instead of a divi-
dend) into account without the latest
fall to only 51 cents.
One of the reasons given for the low
rig usage is the increased concentration
on offshore areas. But ODE is also to
participate in this from next month,
when its 40 percent-owned floating drill
platform (Zapata Off-shore Co. owns
the rest) begins work off the Gippsland
coast for a combination of Woodside,
Continental, Planet, and AOG. How-
ever, some time will elapse before
shareholders benefit from this because
of the size of loan repayments.
For those prepared to buy against the
trend, ODE at around par looks in-
teresting, provided the company can
afford to pay its future dividends in
cash rather than bonus shares.
READERS of this page will be well
aware of the investment prospects
in cardboard containers an
industry which now appears to be
following the forecast made here in
April and is emerging on to a far more
satisfactory profit level. It was most
significant that last week the chairman
of Fibre Containers Ltd. reported sales
and profits in the first quarter of
1966-67 were “well above” those of
the same period of last year.
Fibres had a difficult 12 months to
June, with profits well down and
dividends cut from 15 percent to 12
percent. It now appears that the
reasons behind Fibres’ recovery are
not just that the Tasmanian subsidiary
has finally got over its problems, but
that the new “understanding” in prices
in the fibre packaging industry is now
beginning to have a real effect on
profits, particularly following the price
increases of a couple of months ago.
These fart ” s should over

British Tobacco subsidiary), Reed Paper

Earlier this year, the Chartist and
the Security Analyst were both un-
impressed by this group of companies
and preferred National Bag to them
all. Since then, the share price of
National Bag has fallen from $1.64 to
$1.55, while Fibres have remained
steady at $1.30, Fieldings have risen
12 cents to $3.62, and Dodge and Reed
have eased a few cents.
National Bag, for all its repeated
takeover rumors, is now in a more
competitive situation, with St. Regis-
ACI being a formidable opponent in
multi-well sacks.
There is good buying, nevertheless, in
this group of solid fibre companies;
even with the economy running at its
present slack rate, the industry is doing
much better. The scope for further
improvement is very real.
THE Consolidated Goldfields float
(which has closed heavily over-
subscribed) will probably not be
the last opportunity for local investors
to take up an interest in foreign-owned
mining developments here.
The U.S. Pickands Mather group has
spent almost $BOO,OOO in the last three
years on a survey of 30,000 square
miles of Western Australia and has
discovered some prospects in copper,
lead, zinc, nickel, and manganese that
it considers worthy of further develop-
ment. The amount of money the group
has already spent suggests fairly
strongly that it considers the prospects
impressive enough to continue doing
so; it is committed under its agree-
ment with the W.A. Government to
spend $200,000 a year, and it has far
exceeded that.
This is the iron ore mining and pro-
cessing company’s greatest exploration
effort in its history and certainly
its largest diversification into non-
ferrous mining.
If these prospects turn out as good
as hoped Pickands Mather intends to
form a local public company to exploit
them with local shareholders. But this
would be quite a few years off.
Time will tell whether local institu-
tional investors would take to it with
as little enthusiasm as they did to its
Savage River iron ore project.
There has been no tradition of local
institutions investing in mining ven-
tures; many have rules against it, and
it has only been in recent years that
the more adventurous have joined in
projects like the bauxite development
at Gove. Presumably many of them
will have had to pass over the oppor-
tunity to take up shares in the Con-
solidated Goldfields float for this
reason.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Passing Problems at ACH
A FORTNIGHT ago I wondered
why the share market should have
cut the price of Amalgamated
Chemicals’ shares to half that which
was paid by Continental Oil for a
majority holding only six months
earlier. A somewhat similar circum-
stance exists in the case of Australian
Chemical Holdings Ltd., but in this case
the share price took rather longer to
subside from the high price of $2.50
which Hercules Powder offered for each
share to obtain between 50 and 60
percent of the total equity capital.
It is more than likely that this fall
in price had a fundamental background,
for on March 11 the company an-
nounced that Diecasters Pty. Ltd. was
experiencing difficulties and there had
been a “sharp reduction” in group
profits. At that time the company was
expecting an improvement in the second
half of the year. On June 20 it was
stated that: “It would now appear at
this stage that the company’s net earn-
ings will be well down on the previous
year.”
Diecasters was acquired in 1961,
but the genesis of the engineering
division occurred in 1959, when Frank
G. Spurway was acquired. This latter
company see,ms to have been profitable,
as does Servus Forging, which was ac-
quired in April, 1962. Diecasters, how-
ever, seems to have been a drag on
group profits almost since it was ac-
quired, and one would perhaps judge
from the 29 percent fall in group net
profit before, tax and depreciation in
1965/66 that last year was the most
costly of the five years during which it
has been a member of the ACH group.
Strong action seems to. have been
taken to remedy the position. The Eliza-
beth factory completed and occupied
during 1961/62 has been closed and
put up for sale. In 1964/65, certain
types of plastic extrusion were discon-
tinued and the small .factory at Don-
vale was closed. The activities of Die-
casters, Spurways, and Servus Forging
will now be integrated, it would seem,
and the new company will be known as
Spurways Industries. One of the main
benefits of this reorganisation will be
a reduction in operating expenses.
From figures given in the 1964
annual report, it would seem that ap-
proximately 17 percent of the group’s
total sales was directly to the auto-
motive industry. It is possible that after
1965/66 some action will be taken to
try to lessen this dependence on the
particular industry. The implications
of the “acquisition” by Hercules Pow-
der, which has since raised its total
holding in Australian Chemical Hold-
ings to over 52 percent, have not as yet
become clear. Hercules Powder Co.
(Aust.) Pty. Ltd. has directed its activi-
ties since it was formed toward supply-
ing the needs of the paper and syn-
thetic rubber industries in Australia and
it could be that these activities will be
developed substantially. No doubt the
experts from Hercules Powder in the
U.S.A. have been studying the local
market for some considerable time; in
due course they will select one or more
areas where the advantages of the
U.S.A. company’s technology will be
most beneficial.
When one makes a study of the
group results of the past five years, it
becomes apparent that these results
have been very satisfactory in view of
the economic environment of this par-
ticular period. After making various
adjustments, it would seem that net
profit before tax and depreciation per
share has moved steadily upward from
1961/62 until 1964/65, despite the fact
that Diecasters was making little or no
contribution to group profit. As men-
tioned earlier, there was a marked fall
in 1965/66, but the figure was still 16
percent higher than the 1961/62 figure.
JN July, 1966, it was announced that
the company would issue up to $2.5
million (including over-subscriptions)
to provide funds for the development
and diversification of the companies
within the group. In 1965/66 $1 million
was obtained from Hercules Ltd., of
Canada, and, unless these amounts will
be used in part to repay the $1.5
million due for repayment during
1966/67, loan capital will be between
$5.5 million and $6 million at the end
of the current year. It seems quite pos-
sible that the total interest charge in
1966/67 will exceed the group after-
tax earnings of 1965/66.
Earnings per share for 1965/66 were
probably about eight cents. “Probably,”
because the amount provided for in-
come tax would appear to be much
larger than necessary, to judge by the
group net profit before tax. This would
mean that at the current price of $1.65

probably been obscured by the problems
of Diecasters, and in the next five years
we cannot see what benefits might
arise from the closer association with
Hercules Powder..
If it is assumed that 1963/64 profits
are reasonable for the group and, be-
cause of the prospects, a price-earnings
multiple of 15 is reasonable also, then
one could pay up to $2.00 for the
shares. However, in today’s share-price
environment, a multiple of 15 is a
very high one.


MINING
Windfalls from Royalties
("'I OVERNMENT’S are not the only
jf bodies to make money out of
mineral royalties while someone
else does the hard work. Apart from the
arrangements oil exploration companies
come to with holders of leases over
promising areas (like Esso and BHP),
there are several listed companies stand-
ing to benefit from royalties paid by
other companies developing their areas.
Rutile and Zircon Mines (Newcastle)
Limited, jointly owned by Kathleen
Investments (Australia) Limited and
Peko Wallsend Investments Limited,
pays royalties to its proprietor com-
panies in terms of the initial agreement
under which they are entitled to a
royalty of $4 per ton of rutile won
from those leases contributed by each
party to the joint mining operation. As
each company shares in the profits of
this venture, through its shareholding,
it can be seen that these royalties are
aimed at evening out the possible gain
to each company if they had mined
the areas separately rather than through
the joint company.
Alluvial Gold Limited, listed in
Sydney, receives the bulk of its $30,000
p.a. income from royalties paid by
Ravenshoe Tin Dredging Limited
(currrently making a 1-for-l bonus
issue). These royalties arise from the
company’s sponsorship of Ravenshoe
Tin in 1952 and are at the rate of
2\ percent of the net realisation pro-
ceeds of tin concentrates won from
dredging areas acquired from Alluvial
Gold Limited. Since that time, the com-
pany has continued to prove additional
tin-bearing areas and makes these
available to Ravenshoe Tin on payment
of the same royalty.
Thiess Holdings Limited receives a
royalty of 20 cents per ton on sales in
excess of 600,000 tons per annum frojn
the coal deposits at Moura in central
Queensland, which it discovered and
which are being developed by Thiess
Peabody Mitsui Coal Pty. Limited.
This company’s present export con-
tract to Japan calls for the shipment
of over 2\ million tons per annum by
1968 and Thiess will accordingly re-
ceive quite a handsome sum from its
discovery of this deposit approxim-
ately $400,000 per annu,m.
But even this sized payment is rela-
tively small compared to- those to be
made to the discoverers of the big
iron ore deposits now being developed
in W.A. and Tasmania. Mr. Roy
Hudson, the entrepreneur of the Sav-
age River development in Tasmania,
will earn royalties of around $lO mil-
lion from that project. Royalties to be
paid by the developers of the Mount
New,man deposits in Western Australia
to the original leaseholders, Mr. Stan
Hilditch and Mr. Charles Warman, are
likely to exceed $4.5 million, while Mr.
Lang Hancock, who first noticed the
Hamersley deposits when his light plane
was forced down in bad weather, stands
to receive $1 million per year, rising
to more than $1.5 million per year.
As was pointed out here recently (8.,
Oct. 29) in an article on royalties paid
by companies mining in N.S.W., the
biggest royalty earners are the State
Governments at least when metal
prices are high.
Royalties are collected by all other
States and Commonwealth Territories,
although Tasmania has no general
royalty provision and the $9 million
royalties it will receive from develop-
ment of the Savage River iron ore
deposits arise from a special agreement.
The rates levied by the various States
and Territories vary and, naturally
enough, place .most emphasis on those
minerals which are predominant in the
mining industry in each State. Thus
Queensland rates of royalty on copper
do not escalate steeply in the manner
of New South Wales rates, but reflect
conditions as they were when Mount
Isa was one of the few Australian cop-
per miners not in receipt of a bounty
on copper production and that was
not so long ago at all, 1964 in fact.
The relevance of royalty rates to
commercial conditions is also apparent
in the Queensland rates for rutile and
zircon. When these rates were laid down
in 1956 they were at the rate of $1.50
per ton of rutile concentrates and 25
cents per ton of zircon concentrates, re-
flecting the relative prices for these
minerals at that time. Recently, zircon
has been selling at prices much higher
than when these royalties were laid
down, and the rutile-zircon producers
in Queensland are receiving quite a
windfall from this in contrast to their
colleagues in New South Wales, where
the rates are the same for zircon as
for rutile, i.e., percent of f.o.b. value.
In Western Australia, when royalties
were instituted in July, 1958, quite a
few minerals were temporarily ex-
empted due to the depressed state of
metal markets. Thus, no royalty was
levied on copper or lead production,
while a nominal rate of 20 cents per
ton of concentrates was provided for
tin production. Other rates of interest
are for the production of ilmenite, 10
cents per ton of concentrates; nickel
one-half percent of the realised value
f.0.b.; and 15 cents per ton for iron
ore. The last mentioned refers to the
ore at present being shipped to eastern
States by the Broken Hill Proprietary
Company Limited, while the ore
deposits being developed by Conzinc
Riotinto of Australia at Hamersley, and
by other companies and syndicates in
the north-west, are the subject of
specific agreements with the Western
Australian Government.
COMMODITIES
Copper Faces U.S. Buying
ALTHOUGH the copper market
seems to be making most of its
calculations in terms of changing
fortunes in Zambia, the next big effect
on free market prices could be from a
significant increase in U.S. buying.
Already, U.S. fabricators who pay only
£2BB a ton for Government-price-
controlled domestic copper, which meets
most of their needs, can afford to pay
£450 and more a ton in the LME for
marginal needs, and so the U.S. tail is
wagging the European dog.
The consequent rise in copper prices
to £475 (up £l2O in the past three
months, although still well below the
£790 a ton of last April) has meant
that European (and now Australian)
fabricators are buying a large propor-
tion of their metal at LME prices, fol-
lowing producers’ abandonment of fixed
price schemes. So, substitution of other
materials for copper continues in
Europe in particular, with one large
cable company, for example, now using
more aluminium than copper for
medium-power cable.
In the U.S. the low copper price has
not given the same stimulus to substi-
tution; industrial demand is rising and
so is military consumption, keeping U.S.
copper supplies tight against the
apparent world-wide trend. The total
output of the U.S. copper producing
industry (along with another 5 percent
of its needs imported, also at the fixed
price of £2BB, from Chile) is not
enough to meet local demand, and
Government stockpile releases of
roughly 40,000 tons a month have been
required.
“The Economist” says that the U.S.
stockpile, at 411,000 tons, stands well
below what is thought to be a safe war
reserve of 775,000 tons and further re-
leases would intensify the already severe
political pressures on the administration
not to run the stockpile down too far.
“Clearly, President Johnson has been
hoping for a solution in Rhodesia to
bring the open market price down to
the U.S. level of £2BB. This would
solve his problem without forcing him
to raise the U.S. copper price. But if
the stockpile goes much lower and the
LME price stays high, he will have to
give in.” And the free market will have
to find another 40,000 tons a month for
America.
But schemes of expanding production
will mean that output will rise strongly
over coming years —and ending the
Vietnam conflict would throw copper
markets into a nose-dive —indicate that
the copper big dipper may have gone
over a hump despite the prospect of
unleashing more U.S. demand on world
markets.
Meanwhile, in the shorter term,
Rhodesia’s demand for the return of
rail trucks used in shipping coal to

Zambia has reduced coal supplies to
copper smelters. Zambian output of
finished metal has been cut 25 percent
as a result. This had little effect on an
LME market which had already antici-
pated such a move and which is more
influenced by U.S. buying, anyhow.
This is a matter for the Zambian
Government, as shipment of a larger
proportion of copper exports through
Rhodesia would free trucks for coal
imports. Negotiations are also under
way at present for wage increases for
black mine workers as proposed by an
official inquiry.
The Zambian Government’s deter-
mination to oppose the rebel regime to
its utmost, despite lack of real support
from either its fellow African nations
or the rest of the world, will make it
reluctant to admit defeat until the
last moment, however. Moreover, the
coming rains will cut road links, and
it seems likely that Zambia, failing a
boost in external aid, will have to fall
back on the Rhodesian rail facilities
even further.
The possibility of U.N. intervention
if Mr. S.mith makes no moves toward
conciliation within a few weeks is a
large question-mark over the future
for the Copperbelt.
THE London Metal Exchange zinc
market has reacted to world-wide
cuts in production by moving the
three-month price higher. The spot
price continues around £stg. 100-102 a
ton, with producer buying less import-
ant, for the present at least.
The market for metal for delivery in
three months’ time has in the past been
a better reflection of general trade con-
ditions for the metal, though producer
interference has not been absent. Last
week the future price moved above
£97 a ton for the first time since May,
having been down to about £9O in the
interim.
The latest production cutbacks have
included the Conzinc Riotinto of Aus-
tralia Ltd. group, Cockle Greek plant
(Sulphide Corporation), five' more
Canadian producers, and RTZ in
Britain. The Sulphide Corporation cut
was unspecified, while the two overseas
reductions were by about 10 percent.
These moves fit into the pattern out-
lined here last week, which follows the
producers’ decision to attempt to hold
their £lO2 a ton fixed price. It will
soon be clear how the moves have
affected the LME, and also how com-
plete has been the acceptance by pro-
ducers of the cuts.
CANADIAN producers of asbestos,
major suppliers to Australia, are
expected to raise prices at the
end of 1966. A five percent lift is re-
ported to be planned.
The largest producer, Johns-Manville
Co., of Canada, has confirmed that a
move is under consideration. In
January, 1965, prices were increased by
between 5 and 16 percent. Prices range
from $4O a ton for very short fibres
to $l4lO for best grade spinning fibres.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
After Broken Hill South’s phosphate announcement, the
markets excitedly sent the shares up as high as $3.26; they
finished more rationally at $3, still up 25 cents on the week.
Equally puzzling, Carlton and United Breweries “Z” were
brought back 5 cents to $2.95 on word of a new brewery for
Melbourne. Cleveland Tin eased a further 3 cents to 42. Keen
dealings closed Western Mining at $6.84, although at one stage
the shares reached $6.96.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Look at D. & I. Debentures
IT now seems certain that Deposit and
Investment Ltd. is going to survive.
That in itself gives the company’s
listed debentures an interesting (and
only slightly speculative) look. And
there is a prospect of a dividend to
shareholders within two or three years,
which helps explain this year’s jump in
the price of D & I shares from 12 cents
to 30 cents (a trend forecast in June by
the Chartist).
The company went close to founder-
ing; individual shareholders probably
have to thank Deposit and Investment’s
good and powerful friends (its impor-
tant shareholders, Perpetual Trustee Co.
and Washington H. Soul Pattinson, re-
tailing chemist and investor) who, in
protecting their own and their clients’
interests by directorial control, saved
everybody’s bacon.
In October, 1965, directors said mem-
bers of the board between them directly
represent the holders of more than 3m.
stock units out of issued capital of 16m.
stock units and were concerned with
the persistence of losses.
The company’s business has changed
dramatically from the “small business”
financing that brought on the 1963 bad
debts crisis. At April, 1963, the break-
down of amounts outstanding revealed
that 47.3 percent of loans were to food
retailers; 28.3 percent to hotels, private
hospitals, and other businesses; 15.5 per-
cent were real estate mortgage loans,
and 8.9 percent personal loans.
B Y 1966 the classification of outstand-
ings was very different, with 56.2
percent in real estate (two-thirds of
loans now being made are on
mortgage); 16.2 percent short term
commercial loans (bridging finance);
10 percent personal loans; 8.3 percent
loans to food retailers, and 9.3 percent
to other businesses.
Real estate loans do not earn the
same high interest as the old business
loans, but bad debts and administrative
overheads are much less. This field is
now much more competitive.
In the past four years about $lO
million has been written off in bad
debts. But these huge losses seem to
have ended. The latest year’s trading
resulted in a $511,000 profit after pro-
viding $949,000 for doubtful debts, and
management was sufficiently confident
to write back slm. of the doubtful
debts provision into the profit and loss
appropriation account, so that the debit
balance there is now only $2,651,000.
No tax was necessary in 1966 and the
company should enjoy a tax holiday
for at least another two years, as it is
carrying tax losses of $2.9 million.
Dividends could well be deferred
until the company is paying tax again.
Nonetheless, market enthusiasm may
rally the shares above the steady pro-
gression back to parity when the com-
pany announces its results for the half-
year to December, 1966, about next
March.
The company will be anxious to put
its best foot forward, for sl.Bm. of its
debentures mature in March and ss.lm.
in June (making up almost half its
debenture borrowing). A significant
proportion of debenture holders are
also shareholders, so it would be in
their long-term interest to renew their
loans.
The company seems well able to
avoid any serious consequences of a
high redemption rate, however,
although its activities and profit
potential would be reduced by too
heavy a redemption. The main thing is
that such a situation could be met
by its cash intake, which, last year, was
about $2O million. And at least Deposit
and Investment’s secured borrowings
of slsm. are exceeded by its own
mortgage loans on real estate alone
of $ 16.3 m. at June 30 last, let alone
the $12.7m. in other receivables.
Debenture holders of few finance
companies would be in this strong
position. The $4.7m. lent out as bridge-
ing finance can become readily avail-
able if required.
Net tangible asset backing per 50c
share is restored to 52c, and for each
$lOO debenture is $157. No fantastic
growth can be expected from the com-
pany in the next few years, because it
will be restricted by its borrowing cap-
acity. But a reasonable level of profita-
bility with restoration of dividends
should be achieved in two years or so.
Probably the greatest rewards likely
from this stock are in the debentures,
where recent prices of $B5 for the $lOO
1\ percent June, 1969, issue give
a redemption yield around 17 percent
(of which about 7 percent would be
tax-free capital gain). And the 1\ per-
cents that mature in June next year
are selling at about $9B, to give a $2
capital profit sweetener to the $5.6
interest to come from holding these for
less than 8 months.

The CBA "teetered on the brink of catastrophe"
LAND BOOMERS-II
The Commercial Bank of
Australia is 100 years old this
year, but it survived the Land
Boom by the skin of its teeth in
a period that gets no mention
at all in the bank's official
history issued with this year's
balance sheet. Michael Cannon
tells of the CBA's crisis in the
second of three instalments
from his book, "The Land
Boomers" (Melbourne University
Press, $7.50), to be printed in
The Bulletin.
BEHIND the imposing facades of
some of our better-known institu-
tions, the sad ghosts of past years
sometimes emerge from dank vaults.
There was a time when even such re-
spectable institutions as the Commercial
Bank of Australia teetered on the brink
of catastrophe. Given just a slight altera-
tion of circumstances, the bursting of
the boom might easily have swept away
this great banking house.
The Commercial Bank of Australia
Ltd. was started in 1866 by Gideon
Lang, Mars Buckley, and other leading
Melbourne men.
The Commercial started with a strong
board, but as the original directors died
or retired and new men took their place,
a situation gradually arose where not
one director had any first-hand know-
ledge of banking, except as a customer.
George Meares, chairman during the
The Battle between Shareholders and Depositors
SINKING DEPOSITOR - “Save me, save me! I’ve been
depending on that lifebuoy; save me!”
SHAREHOLDER - “Get away and drown, you rude
fellow. Isn’t MY salvation more important than yours?”
Melbourne Punch, February 25, 1892.
critical period, was a retired draper.
He was perhaps better known as com-
poser of a cantata for the Melbourne
International Exhibition of 1880. An-
other director, George Coppin, MLC,
was one of the most successful com-
edians ever to appear on the London
and Australian stage, as well as being
a formerly insolvent mining speculator.
Nathan Thornley, MLC, was a building
surveyor. Matthew Lang, MLC, was a
wine and spirit merchant, and Mayor
of Melbourne, who died insolvent in
1892. Thomas Mowbray was another
draper and furnisher. J. M. Davies,
MLC, was a solicitor, politician, and
land speculator.
The key figure in the bank’s develop-
ment was undoubtedly Henry Gyles
Turner, who left a position with the
Bank of Australasia in 1870 to become
general manager. Under Turner’s guid-
ance, the Commercial Bank began to
build up the largest business of any
bank in Australia. How then could it
come to be one of the weakest of the
so-called Associated Banks, and one of
the first to go to the wall? There were
several good reasons. The bank financed
too many suspect building societies. It
accepted too high a ratio of deposits to
capital and reserves, so that when a
run occurred, a safe margin of cash was
not available. It financed too many
risky accounts of land speculators. And
its shares were “beared” in the market
at the first rumors doubting the bank’s
stability.
During the building society boom, the
Commercial competed keenly for their
accounts, and at one time had advances
to 18 societies on its books. When the
building society failures began to shake
public confidence,
the Commercial
helped them on
their downward
path by suddenly
withdrawing their
overdraft facilities.
At the time of its
own suspension, the
Commercial carried
only three such ac-
counts. In its period
uf generosity, the
(o.mmercial Bank
heavily financed
Mich leading specu-
lators as Thomas
Bent, Edward
Latham, J. A. Kit-
chen, Abraham
Kozminsky, and
many others. The
bank’s loans figured
in a large propor-
tion of debts con-
cealed by secret
compositions, as
well as in many
open bankruptcies.
As companies be-
gan to crash in the aftermath of the
boom, the Commercial became a favor-
ite subject for gossip.
The fluctuations in Commercial Bank
shares were, however, much more
logical than the bank ever admitted,
The highest price they ever reached
was £l2 in 1888. The week before the
Commercial collapsed, the shares were
being hastily unloaded at £2/8/-.
On the evening of April 4, 1893,
therefore, as the Easter break came to
an end, the newspapers were given the
astounding news that the great Corn-
mercial Bank had suspended payment
and would not open its doors on the
following morning. The value of the
shares had been forced ever down-
wards as shareholders desperately tried
to unload their holdings for fear that
the bank’s remaining capital might be
called up. Why did they think this?
The rumors that the Commercial Bank
was grievously involved in the land
smash proved only too true.
The reconstruction scheme, drafted
by J. M. Davies, basically involved the
calling-up of all outstanding capital,
and the compulsory conversion of fixed
deposits into preference shares. Current
accounts under £lOO could still be
operated on, but other current obliga-
tions were postponed. It was unjust
and unfair to those who had deposited
large sums with the bank, but at the
time there seemed no alternative. The
calling-up of capital was a major factor
in forcing many shareholders into bank-
ruptcy. They just did not have the
cash, and could not borrow money, to
pay their calls.
The reconstruction proposals were
submitted to a mass meeting of share-
holders at the Athenaeum Hall on
the morning of April 7, 1893. The
meeting was generally sympathetic to
the directors and their problems. No-
body asked any awkward questions
about the bank’s lending policies during
the boom, and nobody suspected how
deeply the bank’s chief executives were
personally involved.
Because it believed in the “temporary
nature” of the crisis, the Commercial
Bank also thought it right to conceal
from its shareholders the fact that at
least three of its chief executives had
been indulging in land-booming
activities on their own account.
There is no doubt that Turner knew
the desperate position of his land-
booming executives, and knew what a
sensation such a revelation would be.
Later, dealing with the reconstruction
scheme, he wrote that: “It was ad-
mittedly an infraction of the unwritten
law and honorable traditions of the
English banking system. It was fully
open to the charge of being oppressive
and inequitable. But the only alterna-
tive was not to be contemplated.”
Even then, Turner could never quite
bring himself to confess that his own
colleagues were among the worst of
the speculators. William Turner, his
Chief Inspector of Branches, and
Arthur Nichols, manager of the head
office of the Commercial Bank, paid
3d. in the £ on debts totalling £50,000.

STRENGTH OF NORTH BROKEN HILL LIMITED
REVIEWED BY CHAIRMAN
“ Well equipped to take advantage
of opportunities”
The Annual Meeting of North Broken Hill Limited
was held in Melbourne on Thursday, Oct. 27, 1966.
Mr. M. L. Baillieu was Chairman.
Highlights of fhe Chairman’s speech were:
Financial: Referring to the company’s profit of
$7,576,000 for the year ending June 30, 1966, com-
pared with the previous year’s figure of $8,230,500,
Mr. Baillieu said the surplus from operations was
$4,800,000 after taking into account administration,
depreciation, royalty and taxation attributable to
operations. This result, while not as high as the
previous year ($6,300,000) must be regarded as
another very satisfactory year for the North Mine.
Income from investments rose substantially from
$1,920,000 in 1965 to $2,742,000.
As predicted in last year’s review, a satisfactory price
for lead had held throughout the year. Lead prices
for the four quarters averaged $240, $257, $256 and
$231 respectively. The price of zinc had fluctuated
even less.
The net result was that income from mine production
was $21,600,000 compared with $24,400,000 for the
previous year. Mine and exploration expenditure for
the financial year totalled $9,890,000, a substantial
increase compared with $8,900,000 for the previous
12 months.
Shareholders who read the annual report would note
that fhe expenditure for mine plus exploration in
1963 was $6,122,000 or $3,770,000 lower than 1966.
Mr. Baillieu said that the biggest factor in this
increase was Lead Bonus payments. Other factors
included increases in wage rates, increased holiday
and pension fund payments, price increase in stores,
and increase in mine personnel. Mine output had
risen from 426,000 tons for the year ending June 30,
1963, whilst for 1966 the comparable figure was
503,000 tons.
Development: Referring to development during the
year at North Broken Hill, Mr. Baillieu said that of
the 56,299 feet of diamond drilling carried out, 26,280
feet were from underground locations to seek further
information about main ore bodies, mainly at, or
around, the 5000 feet horizon and to investigate the
possibilities of the “Western Mineralisation”.
Mr. Baillieu said that during the year the decision to
deepen No. 3 shaft had been taken and it was
anticipated that sinking operations would begin early
in 1967. This would not only make available the ore
to which it gave direct access but would in time make
possible a thorough elucidation of the potentialities
of the ore body at greater depths. The deepening of
No. 3 shaft would not interrupt productive operation.
Exploration: Turning to the company’s exploration
activities outside Broken Hill, Mr. Baillieu said that
the geological and other technical exploration staff
had been increased to cope with expanding require-
ments in areas including the Northern tableland of
New South Wales, the Murray River region of South
Eastern Australia and the Irvinebank tin field in
North Queensland.
North Broken Hill Limited were participants, also,
in joint venture prospecting projects in many parts of
Australia. These were under the management of
Broken Hill South Limited, Western Mining Corpora-
tion Limited, Pickands Mather and Co. International,
and Newmont Proprietary Limited.
Investments: Referring to investments not listed on
the Stock Exchange, Mr. Baillieu said that the com-
pany’s most important investment was The Broken
Hill Associated Smelters Proprietary Limited at Pt.
Pirie, South Australia.
8.H.A.5., in its own right, operated a substantial
coal mining and coke business at Coalcliff, New
South Wales. The colliery was a large producer of
high grade coking coal of which Japan was a buyer.

Drilling with machine and air leg in open slope at North
Broken Hill mine.
B.H.A.S. had embarked on a major development in
the erection of a fuming plant at Pt. Pirie to treat the
slag dump, and an electrolytic treatment plant to
treat the fume produced for the recovery of zinc
metal. The cost of this project would be near to $l5
million and the capacity near to 40,000 tons of zinc
per annum.
Mr. Baillieu said that he had no doubt that, over the
years, the whole project would make a substantial
contribution to B.H.A.S. and the North Company
should benefit accordingly.
Mr. Baillieu said that Metal Manufactures in which
North had a substantial interest enjoyed a successful
year, and the company viewed its investment there
with confidence.
In the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company
of Australia Limited, North had an important invest-
ment which continued to progress.
A contract had been concluded by the E. R. and S.
Company to refine the whole of Mt. Lyell’s blister
output for seven years as from January 1, 1966.
Additional construction work, mainly for the treat-
ment of copper concentrates from CSA mine at
Cobar, N.S.W., had continued. The rebuilding of the
tank-house was completed and a refinery capacity of
50,000 tons of copper per annum should be available
by the end of December.
North Broken Hill Limited held 3 million fully paid
shares of $2 each in Alcoa of Australia Proprietary
Limited, representing 12% of issued capital.
The current expansion of the alumina refinery at
Kwinana, which would raise the capacity to 410,000
metric tons per annum, was nearing completion; at
Anglesea construction had begun on the company’s
150 megawatt electric generating station, scheduled
to supply electric energy to the Point Henry smelter
and fabricating plant by 1969.
Alcoa: Alcoa had disposed of all its available metal
output in 1965 and expected to do so again in 1966.
The company was increasing its participation in the
Australian market and developing export outlets.
The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in which
North was a shareholder, reported considerable
expansion during a successful financial year. The
company had contracts to keep the plant occupied
for at least five years.
Review of Metal Market: The statistical position of
lead throughout the year had been good and it was
not easy to understand the appreciable fluctuations
on the London market.
The B.H.A.S. had experienced no difficulty in dis-
posing of its lead production and whilst this would
be the case in 1967, stocks were showing an increase.
Zinc sold at the producer price of £lO2/-/- sterling.
However, there had been a tendency for stock to
increase in the last few months.
Silver remained in good demand.
In conclusion, Mr. Baillieu said that despite what the
future held, the strength of the company was obvious.
It had a high grade mine; substantial and highly
developed ore reserves; an experienced staff and
labour force; and it could not be better equipped
to take advantage of whatever opportunities were
available to it.

death in 1900.
The Commercial Bank remained on
the brink of the abyss for many years.
In 1896 it showed a profit of £30,000,
a sum insufficient to pay even the
interest on the preference shares. The
“Age” claimed that the bank’s interest
rates on overdrafts were too high to
attract much business.
The same year, the directors called
new meetings at the Athenaeum Hall
to save the bank a second time. Share-
holders were asked to approve what
was now called a “rearrangement
scheme.”
Chairman of the bank, James Service,
unfolded a gloomy story of declining
earnings, and the unexpectedly slow pro-
cess of realising old assets. To prevent
“a public disaster,” namely, the suspen-
sion of the bank once again, the mak-
ing of “better terms with creditors” was
unavoidable. J. M. Davies, as the bank’s
solicitor, outlined the complex re-
arrangement scheme by which all de-
posits were to be frozen, and one-
thirtieth paid back at a time. The
bewildered depositors and shareholders
once again put their faith in promises
and left their money in the bank.
Q-. P. MEUDELL, company promoter,
stockbroker, and author of an auto-
biography, “The Pleasant Career of a
Spendthrift,” believed that: “When the
Commercial Bank failed in 1893 it
should have stayed shut. It was in a
most awfully putrid state, for out of
£13 million of assets only about £2
million was realisable. The bank was
able to reopen because under its scheme
of reconstruction the Supreme Court
allowed it to annex £2 million worth
of customers’ deposits and turn them
into preference shares at 4 percent. The
ordinary capital left from the wreck was
only £95,619, and the lucky holders of
ordinary shares were so. protected by an
unjust scheme of reconstruction that
they now draw the bulk of the profits.”
In March, 1897, the Commercial
Bank took advantage of the new Com-
panies Act to write down its capital by
£1,200,000 (equivalent to £4 a share).
H. G. Turner told the Chief Justice
that this amount had been lost by de-
preciation of its securities and the
inability of its debtors to pay in full. So
the Commercial Bank struggled on, with
the Old Man of the Land Boom grasp-
ing its windpipe but gradually re-
linquishing his hold. Its shares were
laughed at on the Stock Exchange, and
new customers were extremely loath to
entrust their cash to an institution which
had nearly foundered twice.
The bank formed a Special Assets
Trust Co. Ltd., into which all the un-
realised assets of the old bank were
placed. These assets, mainly land, were
gradually sold off. The sums realised
were used to liquidate the bank’s £12
million in liabilities. After about 30
years this enormous sum was finally ex-
tinguished, and the bank’s position be-
gan to look healthier. Today it is once
again one of the strongest of the Asso-
ciated Banks, a position achieved at a
human cost which is beyond calculation.

Footing a Bill for Sugar
By E. J. DONATH
ANOTHER industry is in
difficulties and the good old
taxpayer has to foot the bill for
apparently inadequate market research.
The recent expansion aimed at a pro-
duction of 2i million tons by establish-
ing over 1100 new farms and enlarging
many hundreds of existing “assign-
ments” to the total amount of nearly
100,000 acres; the current harvest, soon
approaching its end, is expected to yield
a record of over 2J million tons of
sugar, as compared with 1,380,000 tons
in 1960. Australia has become in the
1960 s the second largest sugar-export-
ing country in the world, and yet hun-
dreds of canegrowers and many mills
are in financial difficulties. In 1960-61
Australia exported less than 800,000
tons of sugar, but in 1965-66 nearly
1,400,000 tons of sugar were shipped
from Australia to Japan, Britain, United
States, Canada, New Zealand, Malaysia,
Hong Kong, and some other countries;
the exportable surplus from the current
harvest will be more than double that
of the beginning of this decade.
An unfortunate combination of
steeply declining world market prices
since November, 1963, and three sea-
sons hot blessed by favorable weather
conditions have caused financial distress
to an Australian rural industry that has
been renowned for its solidity and
stability. Fluctuations in the world mar-
ket price of sugar are notorious. Early
in 1962, the London spot price of
sugar fell to a low of $49 a ton and
rose in November of the following year
to an all-time high of $262; for three
years it has been steadily declining to
the current calamitous price of $29.
It is claimed that the so-called average
cost of production a ton of sugar in
Australia is well above $7O. As a com-
parison, the contract price for our
British quota of 335,000 tons and for
our American quota of about 164,000
tons is $llO, and in Australia the retail
price of 9 cents a pound works out at
$125 for the producer. But it must be
stressed that about 70 percent of our
export, or about 50 percent of total pro-
duction, is sold at world market prices,
especially to Japan, which, in 1964-65,
was our number one sugar customer;
however, in 1965-66 Britain purchased
again more sugar from us than Japan.
Australia’s cost of production is much
lower than those of most of our com-
petitors despite our high wages and
the high standard of living of our 10,000
growers. This is a great credit to the
farming efficiency, resulting in one of
the world’s highest yields of sugar per
acre (about 4 tons of raw sugar).
Highly advanced mechanisation of
growing, loading, transporting, crush-
ing, and refining has put Australia far
ahead of most other sugar-producing
countries; during the current cutting
season, nearly half of the cane was cut
by machines. Nevertheless, if the cur-
rent slump in sugar prices continues
for any length of time, 10,000 growers,
31 mills, and many other sections of
Queensland’s economy connected with
the sugar industry will be in serious
financial difficulties.
Sugar in Queensland is above politics,
since about 200,000 people, or about
half of the total population of all tropi-
cal Australia, live in the sugar-produc-
ing districts north of the Tropic of
Capricorn. The Labor Party’s some-
what surprising victory in the Dawson
electorate (Dr. Rex Paterson) might
have contributed to the Federal Gov-
ernment’s generous loan to the Queens-
land Government to help the sugar in-
dustry over the current difficult situ-
ation. But what about the long-term
future of the industry?
The Commonwealth Government
made available to the Queensland Gov-
ernment a sum of $l9 million to keep
farmers and mills “in business”; this
loan is repayable over a ten-year period
ending ,in 1980. It is assumed that grow-
ers and millers will be able to repay
capital and inter-
est in the 19705;
let us hope that
this loan will not
be written off as
has happened with
other “reconstruc-
tion loans” in the
past. In fact, it is
very doubtful
whether the situ-
ation will improve
■in the 19705, as
Cuba has em-
barked upon an
ambitious plan to
lift its sugar pro-
duction to
10,000,000 tons by 1970.
Queensland’s “sugar renaissance”
was to a large extent the result of the
decline in Cuba’s production resulting
from Dr. Fidel Castro’s Communist
regime. But now a comprehensive pro-
gram of reconstruction of sugar re-
fineries, transport facilities, and dock
installations is under way, mainly by
Russia supplying heavy machinery,
construction equipment, and techni-
cians; Czechoslavakia, East Germany,
Rumania, Hungary, Britain, and France
are among the other countries assisting
Cuba to modernise its main industry.
Despite great efforts to diversify
Cuba’s economy, the country still re-
lies on sugar sales for more than 80
percent of its foreign currency earn-
ings. A successful reorganisation of
Cuba’s sugar industry (the world’s
sugar bowl) does not augur well for
the future of Australia’s main tropical
industry. The world’s sugar consump-
tion is increasing rather slowly (about
five percent a year), but the world’s
capacity of increasing sugar produc-

ANGEL. HOUSE. 2-18 ASH ST., SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES
Address by the Chairman Sir Arthur W. Fadden, G.C.M.G., to
Stockholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company, held
on 29th September, 1966.
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is with pleasure that I again welcome you
to your Company’s Annual General Meeting for 1966.
FINANCIAL RESULTS. The Directors’ Report, Balance Sheet
and Profit and Loss Account for the year ended 30th June, 1966,
have already been circulated to you and set out in detail our
financial results.
The Consolidated Net Profit for the year of $318,642 reflected an
increase of $39,134 when compared with the previous year.
EARNING RATE. Following the conversion of $2 million 7%
Unsecured Convertible Notes to Ordinary Capital on 31st Decem-
ber, 1965, the earning rate on Average Ordinary Capital Employed
fell from 13.00% in 1964/65 to 10.12% in 1965/66.
DIVIDEND. The Paid Up Capital of your Company is now
$4,150,000 and you will be asked today to approve the payment of
a final dividend of $166,000, being 4% on such capital. Assuming
the approval of such payment, dividend cheques will be forwarded
to all Stockholders tomorrow, 30th September, 1966.
The final dividend payment to Stockholders, together with the
interim dividend paid on the 31st March this year, maintained the
annual dividend rate of 8% per annum.
BORROWINGS. Although the borrowing market remains com-
petitive it is pleasing to report the continued support from Members
of the Stock Exchanges, Investors and our own Stockholders.
During the year an underwritten cash and conversion debenture
stock issue of $1,300,000 was made by the Company which in ad-
dition to repaying maturing debentures, enabled us to further
employ funds in real property mortgage securities.
CURRENT TRADING. I am also pleased to advise that despite
keen competition, trading for the two months ended 31st August,
1966, achieved budget and all branches report increased accept-
ances. Your Directors and Management view the future with
confidence.
SMALL STOCKHOLDERS. At present your Company has
10,917 Stockholders and 6,109 Noteholders. An analysis of the
Registers reveals the Company has 7,300 Stockholders and 2,000
Noteholders with holdings of less than $5O in paid-up value.
Dividends and interest payments on these holdings have not indi-
vidually exceeded 54 cents per payment. The composition of our
stockholding has incurred the Company in considerable and dis-
proportionate expense in relation to its total Paid-up Capital,
particularly in respect of the maintenance of the relevant Share
and Note Registers, the printing and supply of Annual Reports,
drawing and payment of dividend and interest cheques, stamp
duty, postage and all other expenses connected therewith.
For some time, representations have been made by small Stock-
holders in respect of their individual problems with such small
holdings and your Directors feel that it would be in the best
interests of this Company and of all Stockholders if steps were
taken to consolidate the individual holdings of our members.
Pursuant to this desire and subject to appropriate approval from
our various Stock Exchanges, your Directors intend to make ar-
rangements with an external company whereunder very small
Stockholders and Noteholders will each be invited to dispose of
their holdings at current market prices. These same small Stock-
holders and Noteholders will also be invited to alternatively
increase their holdings into marketable and more appropriate
parcels by purchasing at the same market price additional Stock
Units or Notes made available from sales within the ambit of this
arrangement.
The Company itself and its major Stockholders will not be a party
in any way to the transaction as it is simply an invitation to small
Stockholders to consolidate their holdings into more marketable
parcels in their own interests and in the interests of the Company
as a whole. The Company’s incentive for prompting this arrange-
ment is the potential reduction in the expense of maintaining its
large Registers.
Your Directors are also mindful that with decimal currency it
may be appropriate at an early future date to convert the Com-
pany’s Stock Units into dollar units and with this in mind it is
hopeful that small Stockholders desiring to retain their holdings
wifi generally attempt to increase their holdings to a paid-up value
of not less than $lOO, this being the then marketable parcel and to
consolidate their holding to an even number, thus eliminating half
shares. It is proposed that Stockholders coming within the category
beforementioned will be contacted at an early date.
STAFF. In conclusion I wish to express the thanks of the Directors
and, I am sure, the Stockholders of the Company, for the contin-
ued loyalty, efficiency and teamwork shown by Management and
all members of the staff throughout the year.
29th September, 1966. A. W. FADDEN, Chairman of Directors.
NFIX92
tion is remarkably large, especially in
some tropical areas in South Africa
and in Europe. World sugar production
has increased from 46 million tons to
over 60 million tons.
Now the highly controversial sugges-
tion of ending the Australian expansion
program at the production of about two
million tons of sugar is finding increas-
ing support. However, a tremendous
capital investment has been made on
the assumption of a production of 2£
million tons. Apart from investment
on farms, additional storage facilities
and mill facilities were constructed
altogether a s2oom. investment pro-
gram (that began early in 1964) is
nearly completed.
Along the 1300 miles-long sugar coast
from the Clarence River in northern
New South Wales to the Daintree River
in far north tropical Queensland, a
great industry has been . built up with
a capital value of land, farming equip-
ment and mills totalling over $500m.;
about one third of the total manufac-
turing work-force is engaged in sugar-
milling along the tropical sugar co&st.
The economic life of whole towns de-
pends to a large extent on sugar, such
as Townsville (population 55,000) and
Mackay, the centre of the “swinging”
Dawson electorate.
has become a significant con-
tributor to Australia’s export in-
come with a peak of slsom. in 1963/64,
out of a total value of production of
s22lm. Now the future of Australia’s
only tropical agricultural industry is
somewhat clouded as, near the end of a
tremendous expansion, the industry has
to face a world glut of sugar resulting
in calamitously low world market prices
which are far below the cost of pro-
duction in any country.
The proponents of Australia’s “Wheat
Production Unlimited” policy and those
of some other fast-expanding rural in-
dustries, should heed the plight of our
sugar industry caught in a financial
crisis due mainly to an over-optimistic
interpretation of world marketing pros-
pects, and especially of prices. Our
expansion was based on the assumption
that the world price would not fall be-
low $lOO a ton for any length of time
as compared with $29 currently; last
year’s return from the higher home con-
sumption sales was about $122 per ton.
Australia, along with other major
world market suppliers, has to ride out
a very difficult period indeed. The
recent expansion of Australia’s sugar in-
dustry has been a failure price-wise in
the short-run, but it should be stressed
that it was a long-term venture to be
judged on the basis of long-term de-
velopments.

MAN ON THE LAND
Wool Promotion Once More
BETWEEN now and February there
is going to be some pretty inten-
sive lobbying within the Aus-
tralian Wool Industry Conference. The
woolgrower contribution to promotion
comes up for renewal in February and
there is now a real indication of wool-
grower doubts on the value of pro-
motion. These were highlighted in
dramatic fashion at the October meet-
ing of the AWIC in Sydney,
Neither the AWIC itself nor the
Wool Board revealed much to the pub-
lic about a motion, lost by 35 votes to
20, that wool promotion be put to a
referendum of growers unless a system
of wool marketing was introduced forth-
with. This was a highly significant vote
which must have sent shivers down the
spine of Wool Board chairman Sir
William Gunn and International Wool
Secretariat director Mr. W. J. Vines.
Continuation of the present promo-
tion levy, to be decided in February,
depends on a three-fifths majority vote
by the AWIC. They must vote 32 to 23,
or better, for the levy to stand for a
further period. The vote on the motion
at the recent AWIC meeting is not
directly connected with the vote to
come in February, but the pattern bf
voting is. The group of 20, who want
a referendum if there is no marketing
system introduced, believe they can get
the extra three votes in February to
stymie continuation of the levy.
The Wool Board, and the IWS, will
be trying hard to convince any waver-
ing members of the AWIC to stick
solidly behind the promotion cause, or
else the vast IWS empire, built by Sir
William Gunn and Mr. Vines, could
be in jeopardy. Three votes is not a
very comfortable margin to work on.
The IWS has grown to an organisa-
tion with more than 300 staff in 20
countries. A large and imposing Wool
House has been erected in London.
Apart from these tangible assets there is
the question of prestige. Sir William,
who combines the job of Australian
Wool Board and IWS chairman, is
recognised in overseas countries as the
spokesman for the Australian wool in-
dustry. His own PR organisation natur-
ally assists in the general projection of
this image and Mr. Vines shares in it.
If the AWIC, made up of delegates
of Australian grower organisations, re-
jects promotion, the prestige of the
IWS and Wool Board, and everyone
connected with either, will slump. Sir
William and Mr. Vines will therefore
be trying hard to induce its .members
to give them a resounding vote of sup-
port in February.
QN top of this there will unquestion-
ably be effort directed at the Fed-
eral Government in the hope that it
might increase its share of wool pro-
motion funds. If the Government
weighed in “dollar for dollar,” a figure
being talked about at present, or went
even better, then a good many wool-
growers might be prepared to let things
ride. It may not work out like that,
however. The Government is currently
under pressure from nearly every
primary-producing section to increase
subsidies. The list is long, and includes
the dairy industry, the seed industry,
the poultry industry, and then there are
the beef roads which interest, among
other people, Sir William himself. The
Americans who have bought properties
in North Queensland and who are being
advised by Sir William in a private
capacity want the Government to build
them beef roads.

ing ground is that if the Government
wants to help growers it would be better
to do it in such ways as increasing
the superphosphate bounty and similar
measures.
The workings of the wool industry,
and the groups within it, puzzle lay-
men, but this is no cause for allegations
of inconsistency, as the organisations
have actually been remarkably consist-
ent. It so happens, however, that the
group which supported Sir William
Gunn and Mr. Vines during the reserve
price campaign now opposes them and
wants promotion put to a referendum.
The group which opposed Sir William
and Mr. Vines during the reserve price
campaign now supports both, where
promotion is concerned, but in little
else.
In the group within the AWIC de-
manding a referendum there are some
familiar names. These include Mr. L.
A. Simpson, Oaklands, N.S.W., grazier
and long-time reserve price advocate,
and Mr. Phil Meehan, president of the
Victorian Wheat and Woolgrowers’
Association, which originally opposed
Sir William, but which entered into a
morganatic marriage with him during
the reserve price campaign. Both men
are said to have been surprised by the
support the referendum motion got at
the recent Sydney meeting. It is also
somewhat significant that the motion
referred to “marketing” and not. “re-
serve price.” This could mean that they
are prepared now to accept so,me kind
of compromise on marketing.
gIMPSON declares that the wool in-
dustry could link promotion with
marketing without massive Government
assistance. The Government, naturally,
reacts kindly to declarations like this.
If it decides on “dollar for dollar,” the
Government contribution (which is the
taxpayer contribution) will be lifted
from about $8 million to about $l4
million. The woolgrower contribution,
if the February meeting gives the all
clear, would stay at around $l4 million.
The Australian contribution to the IWS
(after deductions for the Australian
Wool Board and research in Australia)
would stand at around $26 million.
This would be something over 65 per-
cent of the total world annual budget
of the IWS. But if Australian growers
refuse to go along with their two per-
cent levy, then growers in South Africa
and New Zealand are likely to think
twice about their contributions.
This, in a quite practical way un-
related to personalities, is one sound
reason why the Australian Government
could not take over the major share of
wool promotion, going, say, “dollar and
a half for half.” Such a scheme, while
it would satisfy a lot of Australian
growers and would restore Sir William
Gunn’s personal prestige, would mean
that the International Wool Secretariat
would become the Australian Wool
Secretariat. That might not be such a
bad idea, but it is hard to see how the
promotion mandate with staff from
countries besides Australia could sur-
vive.

Bigger Yields for Sultanas
THEORETICALLY, it shouldn’t
have been possible, but by selec-
tion the yield potential of the
sultana vine has been lifted a lot -
perhaps by as much as one-third. A
new approach to pruning techniques
will also give yields another hefty boost.
As a result, harvests of 20 tons of fresh
fruit per acre are now envisaged for
good years. Crops producing somewhere
around ten tons would have been more
common up to now. Sultana yields
normally fluctuate widely from year to
year, according to the season.
A few months ago the Australian
Dried Fruits Control Board, under the
able leadership of Sir Eugene Gorman,
QC, managed to head the glutted world
market, and its hitherto passionately
individualistic suppliers, toward an
orderliness that promises to at least
meet the growers’ cost of production.
The season did not favor sultana grow-
ing in 1963. In that disastrous year,
with less than average harvests, grow-
ers who got $2O a week for their year’s
effort were lucky.
Now, with strong joint prospects of
better yields and better markets, our
growers ought to be able to adjust
their gloomy faces and look to a
brighter future.
Credit for the improved yield poten-
tial goes to the CSIRO Horticultural
Research Section and in particular to
Messrs. Woodharii, Alexander, Antcliff,
and Dr. May at the Section’s field sta-
tion at Merbein, Victoria. They chal-
lenged the textbooks and time-honored
cultural practices to win success. Theory
suggested, and overseas research had
confirmed, that the sultana vine could
not be improved by selection. Its genes
had been fixed long ago.
The argument for genetic uniformity,
moreover, is strongly supported by ap-
pearances: no matter how minutely
they are scrutinised, all of the millions
of vines in Sunraysia are very much
more alike than the proverbial peas in
a pod. Yet, for all this, a puzzling
feature, frequently observed by both
scientists and growers, is that visually
identical vines growing within a few
feet of each other persist in bearing
differently.
Such differences are accounted for
usually by saying that one vine is prob-
ably getting more sun or water or fer-
tiliser than the other. The Merbein
people were unimpressed by these lame
explanations. They took cuttings from
relatively high- and low-yielding neigh-
boring vines and grew them under
carefully standardised conditions. Then
they took cuttings from the vines estab-
lished from these cuttings and so to
several generations, until they proved
beyond doubt that some vines have an
inherent capacity to yield, more highly
and that this capacity is transmissible
from generation to generation.
|r pHEY have gone on to discover some
of the superior vines growing in
the area and propagate fro,m them.
They are now busily engaged in dis-
tributing these propagules to the grow-
ers with the help of the State Depart-
ments of Agriculture. Replanting is
presently going on at the rate of about
a million vines a year in Sunraysia.
Probably within a decade, therefore,
every commercial sultana vine will be
a selected high yielder. Then the whole
process of replanting with still higher-
yielding selections can be repeated.
While this work was going on, the
principles of pruning and training the
vines were also being studied. By de-
tailed comparisons and repetitions of
different pruning tactics on thousands
of vines during many seasons, the old
fear of exhausting vines by over-
cropping, unless they were severely cut
back in good years, has been over-
thrown. So the order has gone out:
Prune lightly; cut off only as much as is
necessary to keep the vines tidy.
At the same time it was found that
vertically directed shoots generally bear
better than horizontal or downward-
directed shoots. The differences can be
astonishingly large. Thus, buds on ver-
tical canes often yield well over 25
percent more fruit than similarly placed
buds on other canes. Because of this
finding, the appearance of vineyards
will gradually change. In future they
may come to look more like hop orch-
ards as growers change over from a
traditional policy of horizontal vine
culture to one of vertical vine culture.
Cool Branding
AMERICAN farmers and ranchers
are now cooling rather than heat-
ing their branding-irons. Freeze-
branding has several advantages over
fire-branding. It is painless, produces
clearer marks, and does not damage
the skin. Leather-makers have estimated
that brand damage to hides cost the
American industry $2O million a year.
The new method is being adopted not

only by beef-cattle ranchers but also
by dairy farmers, pig raisers, and horse
breeders. Scientists are using it to
identify laboratory animals, including
mice, guinea-pigs, cats, and dogs. Game
wardens are freeze-branding deer, elk,
bears, and even birds and fish, to facili-
tate studies on the movement and popu-
lation changes of these animals.
The branding-iron, preferably made
of copper, is dipped in a mixture of
dry ice and methylated spirit, where it
is quickly chilled to 62 degrees below
the freezing point of water. The iron
is then applied to the animal for about
30 seconds. The site is clipped first on
long-haired animals. The intense cold
permanently destroys the pigment-mak-
ing mechanism of the hair follicles and
pure white hair subsequently grows
from the affected skin. But white cattle
can also be clearly marked by holding
the brand on for a few more seconds.
This actually kills the hair follicles and
bare skin results, though without scar
tissue forming as happens after fire-
branding.
This novel idea was developed at
Washington State University, where
more sophisticated techniques of apply-
ing it are now being studied. One such
involves squirting super-cooled gas over
a plastic stencil laid over the pelt. In
another method being tried, the brand-
ing-iron itself contains the dry ice and
the head of the iron can be revolved
to expose digits up to nine. Freeze-
branding must cost the cattlemen more,
and dry ice may not always be easy to
procure, but because it is humane and
has other on-the-farm advantages
the animals do not have to be rigidly
restrained during branding. it seems
to warrant investigation here.

SPECULATORS DIARY
An Old World Touch in Shares
Gems from the company reports
IN my never-ending, often fruitless, and sometimes misinterpreted pursuit of
knowledge about companies, I’ve come across some rather unusual statements
in the latest bunch of annual reports.
Take this one which appeared in the
annual report of Larke Consolidated:
“Many seek to invest in public com-
panies listed on the Stock Exchanges in
the hope that they will earn income
and that the value of their investment
will keep up with the constantly chang-
ing purchasing power of money. Some
even seek capital profits on the buying
and selling of shares on the public stock
market.” Makes share investment sound
a bit old world!
A more pertinent annual report for
my portfolio was Toft Bros. Industries
Limited. Because of the surprise loss,
I assumed that a full and frank explana-
tion was to be made in the directors’
report. In fact, several reasons were
listed for the disappointing result. In
the main, however, these reasons would
have been equally apparent earlier in
the calendar year and that would have
been the time to highlight them. A
preliminary warning at least would
have eliminated the erratic behaviour of
the share price.
Passing on to the balance-sheet, I
note that the company has introduced
a new accountancy concept in treating
goodwill and patent rights as fixed
assets rather than as intangible assets.
Also appearing under fixed assets are
shares in Queensland Harvesting Com-
pany Pty. Ltd. The layman would
better understand this item if it had
been classified as investments.
Although I consider that the annual
report has certain shortcomings, I have
no complaints about the share price in
the last two weeks. At 42 cents, the
sale of the 600 shares yielded a profit
of $lO.
Unfortunately, this profit was more
than offset by the loss of $53 on the
sale of Emperor Gold at 52 cents. In
due course I’m hoping that Gold Mines
of Kalgoorlie will compensate me for
this loss.
In this rapid-fire selling operation, I
managed to squeeze in the buying of an
additional 1000 G. J. Coles rights at
34 cents. Under the pressure of heavy
selling, these rights had managed to
make good headway and at one stage
touched 39 cents. But the reaction in
the last few days has brought the price
back to 34 cents. The William Adams
rights followed a similar course only to
firm up sharply at the end of the issue.
The other purchase of the week was
Broken Hill South. The vulnerability
of the company as a lead-zinc producer
was illustrated by the significantly lower
profit for the year to June 30, 1966.
Because the lead-zinc price is weaken-
ing still further, the immediate profit
outlook for Broken Hill South is not
bright.
Fortunately, the copper mine that has
just been developed at Cobar will be-
come the major mining operation by
1968. With the outlook so uncertain
in Zambia, copper is still a metal to
be reckoned with in the short term.
The Zambian economy is having great
difficulty coping with its sanction war
against Rhodesia. This situation could
suddenly worsen when the wet season
starts later this month.
Of greater current interest, however,
is the discovery of phosphate near
Cloncurry in Queensland. Australia’s
phosphate requirements are currently
met by imports from Nauru. As re-
serves there are only expected to last
another 25 years, a high-grade phos-
phate discovery such as this one could
be of vital importance to Australia.
Anyway, that’s what the market
thought when it pushed the shares up
from $2.70 to $3.20. I bought 200 at
$3.00 on the rebound.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
600 Toft Bros. .42 $247
1000 Emperor Gold .52 $5lO
BOUGHT
1000 G. J. Coles rts. .34 $34&
200 Broken Hill South 3.00 $614
An amount of $135 remains in the
kitty.
The portfolio now consists of:

Great Moments in Medicine
Although hospitals were known in many of the Far
Eastern lands long before Christ, they were given
their greatest stimulus in the Western World by
Christian organizations. Like this “Great Room of
the Poor,” in the Hotel-Dieu of Beaune, France
(founded in 1443), most early institutions were
hospices for the indigent before they became places
for the care and treatment of the sick.
The clean and efficient hospitals we know today are
a development of the last century. Today, one may
enter a hospital with a new assurance that he will
receive fine medical and nursing care. Gone is the
fear of personal safety that was justified before the
use of anesthetics and antiseptics became routine
hospital procedure.
During the past century, too, Parke-Davis has
become one of the world’s foremost pharmaceutical
firms; a leader in discovering, developing, testing,
manufacturing, and distributing better medicines
for use by physicians in their offices, in hospitals and
in homes—medicines that contribute to longer life
and better health for the people of the world.

Omega self-winding Seamaster: the world's favourite sports watch. Winds itself automatically. Hermatically sealed against water.
As illustrated: Gold filled $96. Also Stainless Steel $7B.
This self-winding Omega Seamaster
is as tough as the sportsmen who will wear it.
Its accuracy and long life are assured by waterproof tests in a special simulator, unique to Omega.
Designed for a long, tough life.
The Seamaster is a sports watch. It has
been built to take the rough-and-
tumble of water skiing, motor racing,
power golf—and still give you pre-
cision timekeeping.
What makes the Omega Seamaster
a great watch?
Certain components of the Omega
Seamaster are machined to an accuracy
of 2/000th millimeter (1 /9th the dia-
meter of a hair). In watchmaking this
is the difference between greatness and
mediocrity, between accuracy and
poor timekeeping.
More accurate because you never
wind it.
The mainspring of a stemwound
watch releases much of its power
immediately after winding. It then
weakens progressively. As the main-
spring uncoils, the accuracy of the
watch is compromised. The mainspring
of the Omega Seamaster reaches peak
tension shortly after you slip on the
watch. Thereafter, every flick of your
wrist winds the movement. The result:
a steady flow of power, i.e. enhanced
accuracy.
Waterproof to a depth of 200 feet.
When Omega say a watch is water-
proof they really mean it. Every Sea-
master has been put through the
unique Omega “diveproofing” test. In
45 minutes the watch is shot through
17 different pressure changes. It’s like
plunging a watch 200 feet below the
sea, then catapulting it to the top of
Mount Everest. Your Omega Sea-
master is therefore ready to accompany
you skindiving, solo-flying or moun-
tain climbing.
The world-famous Omega name.
Like all Omegas, the Seamaster has
been precision-engineered, lavished
with infinite care. It is styled on the
lines of classic elegance that Omega
is famous for. It is unconditionally
guaranteed for a year against any
possible mishap except loss, fire or
theft. All through its long life it will
receive the backing of the Omega
World Service Organization spread
over 156 countries. No wonder Omega
Seamaster is the most sought after
precision sports watch in the world.
You will find the Seamaster at the best
Jewellers only. They were appointed by
Omega because they merit your
confidence.
