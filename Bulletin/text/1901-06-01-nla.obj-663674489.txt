A MARCHING SONG .
We mix from many lands,
We march for very far;
In hearts and lips and hands
Our staffs and weapons are;
The light we walk in darkens sun and moon and
star. ...
O nations undivided,
0 single people and free,
We dreamers, we derided,
We mad blind men that see,
We bear you witness ere you come that ye shall
be . . .
France ! from its grey dejection
Make manifest the red
Tempestuous resurrection
Of thy most sacred head !
Break thou the dovering cerecloths; rise up from
the dead.
And thou, whom sea-walls sever
From lands unwalled with seas,
Wilt thou endure for ever,
O Milton’s England, these ?
Thou that wast his Republic, wilt thou clasp their
knees ?
These royalties rust-eaten,
These worm-corroded lies,
That keep thine head storm-beaten
And sunlike strength of eyes
From the open heaven and air of intercepted
skies;
These princelings with gauze winglets
That buzz in the air unfurled,
These summer-swarming kinglets,
These thin worms crowned and curled,
That bask and blink and warm themselves about
the world;
These fanged meridian vermin,
Shrill gnats that crowd the dusk,
Night-moths whose nestling ermine
Smells foul of mould and musk,
Blind flesh-flies hatched by dark and hampered in
their husk;
These honours without honour,
These ghost-like gods of gold,
This earth that wears upon her
To keep her heart from cold
No memory more of men that brought it fire of
old;
These limbs, supine, unbuckled,
In rottenness of rest,
These sleepy lips blood-suckled
And satiate of thy breast,
These dull wide mouths that drain thee dry and
call thee blest; . . .
These hours that mock each other;
These years that kill and die,
Are these thy gains, our mother,
For all thy gains thrown by ?
Is this that end whose promise made thy heart so
high ? . . .
O sorrowing hearts of slaves,
We heard you beat from far !
We bring the light- that saves,
We bring the morning star ;
Freedom’s good things we bring you, whenoe all
good things are ...
With us the fields and rivers,
The grass that summer thrills,
The haze where morning quivers,
The peace at heart of hills,
The sense that kindles nature, and the soul that
fills ...
The strife of things and beauty,
The fire and light adored,
Truth, and life-lightening duty,
Love without crown or sword,
That by his might and godhead makes man god
and lord.
These have we, these are ours,
That no priests give nor kings;
The honey of all these flowers,
The heart of all these springs;
Ours, for where freedom lives not, there live no
good things.
Rise, ere the dawn be risen ;
Come, and be all souls fed;
From field and street and prison
Gome, for the feast is spread ;
Live, for the truth is living ; wake, for night is
dead.
Algernon Charles. Swinburne .
The Case of Kipling.
H’M ! here we are again.
Dear Bookfellow,— ln your ingenious
answer to my letter (B. 18/5/01), through
the desire to bring in a neat little
parable, you have missed the point at issue
X merely stated that Kipling had done no
worse than thousands of his predecessors, and
therefore was m no respect more blameworthy
Whether—and this is the point you take up—they
ought not all to be censured, is quite another
question. 1 have no doubt some contemporary Aris-
tarchus solved it for them. Thus, you can hardlv
blame one without mcludingall. It has now become
1 un . usual to reproach (say) Shakespeare
with borrowing and improving ideas. Yet if vou
blame Kipling and not Shakespeare, it would
surely be like passing over the delinquency of a
plutocrat, rich and influential in the applause of
many generations, and “running in” a bee-e-ar
who has barely had the time to gain that of one.
1 he distance between Shakespeare and Kinline- is
of course, very great, but the principle is the
same. Finally, surely it is better to borrow and
improve ideas as Kipling and others have done
than not to borrow and not to improve or to
deteriorate.—Believe me, &e., M. L. Mao Oatthm-
Elizabeth Bay Road, IG/5/’OL Vallum.

no evidence whatever to show that
hmriJt f k0re - V as 8uch a raan ) ” deliberately
took credit for originating his heroic sagas in the
way m which Kipling deliberately took credit for
originating these pieces. There is no evidence
whatever that Homer put himself forward as
of the epic fragments which have
crystallised round his name. Lacking evidence
there can be no comparison. ’
d , su £ffif 8 t that in saying, without qualifica-
taon that . Vergil took both the matter and
metre of his from Homer,” M.L.M
makes too wide a statement. The Latin and the
Creek epic are co-ordinated, but dissimilar. And
X point out that, in so far as Virgil borrowed from
Homer, he borrowed from a famous source—his
borrowings were obvious and avowed. Kipling’s
borrowings in “Bill ’Awkins ” and “Love
Heath were from obscure sources. Thus
Virgil s plagiarism was practically acknowledged ;
Kipling s was not. Virgil’s epic cannot be oalled
a paraphrase of Homer’s in the way that Kipling’s
verse was a paraphrase of Flecknoe’s. As to
Recessional ’’ Virgil “ took ” Homer’s metre as
took Quarles’s-metre. But Kipling’s
Quarles’s metre ; and Virgil’s hexameter
is not Homer s hexameter. Virgil’s epic does not
(generally speaking) transfuse Homer’s ideas in
the way in which Kipling transfuses Newman.
T1 '*’■. Ks far as Virgil s imitation of Homer and
Hesiod extends, it has the value of translation—
it gave to many Latin readers their first
glimpse of the literature of Greece. An acknow-
lodged translation has original merit: and Virgil’s
sources in Homer and Hesiod were so famous
so well known, so much studied by Latin writers
that they cannot fairly be compared with “ My
Lulu,” with Flecknoe’s piece, and doubtfully with
Newman’s “ England.” _ Thus M.L.M.’s parallel
of Virgil and Kipling is a false parallel. Had
Kiplmg imitated Dante or Petrarch it might have
held good.
(4) There is no analogy whatever between
Lucretius versification of Epicurean philosophy
He licrwr/i; Natura and Kipling’s imitation of
My .Lulu, his theft from Flecknoe, or his trans-
fusion of Newman’s piece.
(5) It is not possible to deal with all Chaucer’s
and bhakespeare’s multifarious debts in this space
But to say that “ many of Chaucer’s ‘ Canterbury
bales are merely adapted translations from
Boccaccio” is to speak loosely. According to
Courthope’s table (Hist. Eng. Poetry, vol. i) of
twenty-six “ Tales’’ only five are owed to Boccac-
cio. As regards these five, Chaucer was trans-
lator ; “ Boccaccio ” was a classic of his era • and
the argument in 1T 3 applies. In none of these
fivois there a fair analogy between Chaucer’s use
° t Boccacci ° and Kipling’s use of the originals
(6) Shakespeare is the best card in M.L M’s
poor hand; but I doubt if he can show'that
Shakespeare’s debt m any play is of an identical
kind with Kipling’s debt in “Recessional.”
(7) As to the debt of Milton, Malory, and
Tennyson to Geoffrey of Monmouth, there is no
analogy whatever with Kipling’s case. Geoffrev
of Monmouth wrote prose. If M.L.M. refers to
Wace’s Anglo-Norman versification of Geoffrey
apphes. In Tennyson’s day, at least, Geoffrey
and Wace ranked as early classics, historical, not
obscure. Malory s translation of Wiice’s metrical
romance into English prose is not comparable with
Kiphng s transference of preceding verse-rhythms
and ideas to his own work. Comparison of Tenny-
son’s debt (by descent from Malory, through
Wace) to Geoffrey, with Kipling’s direct imitation
or theft m the cases cited, is erroneous. To com-
pare Kipling’s imitation in “Recessional” with
Milton s invention in “Comus ” is equally erro-
neous.
M.L.M. has now been followed through all his
examples of plagiarism similar to Kipling’s.; and
with the doubtful exception of Shakespeare!
there is not one parallel. “Why gird at Kipling
for do ing this?” But Kipling did not do “this”;
so M.L.M.’s argument was as vicious in its illus-
trations as it was vicious in itself.
Remains scope for brief references to the letter
at head of this article.—The blamo- of Kipling
implies blame of all who have done as Kipling
dld - k akespeare is dead ; Kipling is alive
Who knows but, if Kipling is “ reproached ” often
enough, lie may mend his life, leave the primrose
path of plagiarism, and die in the odour of origi-
nality ! Certainly it is better to borrow and im-
prove than not to borrow and not to improve—
if the debt is acknowledged and paid. Ethically
m literature and other fields, it is not better to
steal and improve, than not to steal and not to
improve. Cellini must not steal my nugget to
make a statue. Kipling must not steal my little
ewe-lamb, feed it and shear it, and call'it his
sheep.—Amen.

♦
There was excellent occasion to bring all t
senior classes of Sydney schools to the G.P.<
last week, and address them in some such wore
as these:—
“Boys and Girls: You are brought here
witness and profit by a shining* example of bac
sense, bad taste, and bad art. You see tha
avenue of composition pillars in Moore-stree
from George to Pitt. That is designed in honou
mb i° York, son of the British King
The Duke of York is personally a harmless nonet
tity ; officially he has never been of the least us
to Australia, he never will be of any use. T
waste public money in erecting an avenue o:
columns for him to pass through is an example o
bad sense. Always remember that we shculc
keep public honours for those who earn them.
“Next, consider the columns and arches as a
example of bad taste. Observe that the desig
of them is not original; it is merely imitatec
from the art of Greece ; and the imitation is no
particularly good. The procession in which th
Duke of York figures is an evanescent thing
occurring once only; and good taste would sug
gest that the decorations on its path shoulc
be of an evanescent character. Arches of Aus
tLilian foliage, garlands of Australian flowers
perhaps interwoven with gaily-coloured stuffs, o
varied by bright flags ; —these were the natural
the appropriate setting for thousands of happy
Australian faces—the best processional decoratioi
of all. These truly typify rejoicing. Those
pillars typify bad taste. For they are neithe
bright enough for momentary gaiety, nor solic
enough for a permanent memorial: they fal
between two categories, and fail to symbolise
joyous welcome without achieving triumpha
perpetuity.
“Lastly, consider the avenue of pillars as an
example of bad art. Observe that Moore-street
from George to Castlereagh, is the only wide
street in the central city through which the pro
cession will pass. Remember that it was widenec
at great cost in order that the Post Office building
should be seen to advantage, and in order that the
eye should see with pleasure one noble space in a
city of crooked lanes. Now, notice what the pro-
cessional decorator has done with this noble space.
He has filled it up ! crowded it into insig-
nificance with his array of composition columns
Further, look at the other side. What do you
see? A piece of littered ground, with tem-
porary stands for sight-seers, surrounded by
an ugly hoarding. You descend from the super-
lative of the Post-office —which, with whatever
blemishes, is a considerable architectural per-
formance in this city—past the comparatively
worthless of the decorator’s columns, to the posi-
tively disgusting of the hoarding. Of the three
potential decorative factors in Moore-street, the
Space was first, the Post-office next, and the
piece of littered ground was an eyesore. Any-
one with an artistic sense would have left the
Space alone, left the Post-office alone, and spent his
decorative talent on the eyesore. The least he
could do was to spend his decorative talent at
the street-side, hiding his eyesore, transforming his
hoarding, and making Moore-street its own
avenue. Or he might have covered the waste
plot with flowers and shrubs and fountains,
and replaced the hoarding with a suitable
barrier against the crowd—or removed it
altogether and guarded his temporary park by
police on procession-day—at a less price than it
has cost to point this descent from aristocratic
stone, past bourgeois stucco, into squalor.

wisdom a country is governed ! ”

.“ The Feast of the Bunya, ” bv Cornelius Moy-
nihan (Gordon and Gotch, Brisbane), is a rough
versification of some episodes of Q. aboriginal life
legend. Without having much poetic value,
the little book is readable; and the author has
taken pains to make his picture accurate. There
are many interesting sketches by A. J.
Hingston, by way of illustration ; and anybody
who has never seen a bunyip may gloat over th,e
artist’s faithful presentment reproduced on this
page.
From the dense scrub at midnight
Is heard a fearful noise:
The gins draiv closer to the fire,
And tremble for the boys.
For well they know the bunyip,
From out the clear lagoons,
Hath come to swallow up the youths,
Now absent two full moons.
This is plainly “ The Feast of the —Bunyip.
J.M. : The (deceased) Rev. Hans Mack was a
Wesleyan, not a Primitive Methodist minister.
Libel, undoubtedly; yet Pallas guided the
blade (not rEneas or the comp.) Quote
‘‘English Bards”—“So the struck eagle. ...”
Every care is taken of Wesleyans on this
page, but no, responsibility incurred for
Primitive Methodists. Baptismal certificates of
Presbyterians are required, not necessarily for
publication, but as a guarantee of the real Dill-
Mackay.
Randolph Bedford’s Clarion excites journalists’
admiration : they know what energy, what
organising capacity, are necessary to bring such a
result. The new Victorian number is as effective
as its predecessors. The pictures are the best of
it—a comprehensive collection of Vic. scenes and
people; some of them from the “Picturesque
Atlas ” —that local mammoth whose huge skeleton,
pounded to bone-dust, fertilises so many ingenious
farmers’ fields. The letterpress is done with
labour; and the account of Eureka is not bad ;
but the whole wants re-writing with a style:
Astley’s fine Higinbotham article, from The Bul-
letin, stands too high above the level. The Clarion
pages are terrible reading : Bedford’s ideas are a
size larger than ordinary folks; but his type
on his pages !

Like the flight of the
swiftest hird is the prog-
ress of a hacking cough
into consumption. First
a cold, then a settled cough, then slow
fever, night sweats, and hemorrhages.
Don’t neglect your cough. Stop it
at once and drive away all thought of
consumption. Begin as early as possi-
ble —the sooner the better —to take
Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral
the most effective remedy for coughs
of every kind and in every stage.
One of the most annoying coughs is
a throat cough, where you have that
constant tickling in your throat. It
comes on worse at night, keeps you
awake, and makes you have that
smothered feeling in the chest. It
hardly seems possible what one dose
of Cherry Pectoral will do for this
kind of a cough, it brings such marked
relief.
Put up in large and small bottles.
When the cough gets down deep in
the chest and the lungs are painful,
put one of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral
Plasters directly over the tender lung.
It will draw out all the soreness.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the Milking-Time.
When the first faint rays of morning thro’ the
frosted window peep,
When our limbs are stiff and weary and our eye-
lids press for sleep,
When the calves and kookaburras make a most
unearthly din,
Young Teddy goes on Bellman out to bring the
cattle in.
He hears the distant lowing,
And sets the noddy going
Like wild-fire down the sidling to the fern-log
bridge below.
His dog goes past him flashing,
Madly barking, madly dashing;
And he feels the young nerves tingle and he feels
the young blood glow.
They go by tracklets winding down the gorge in
snaky turns,
To where the cattle harbor in the orangewood
and ferns,
To where the giant windfalls with the thick-laced
brackens make
From storm and rain a shelter, to the sleet-edged
winds a break, —
To the cosy banks of clover
Where white, tender gums grow over,
And the warm breath like an incense hangs upon
the foggy air.
And Rowdy sends them running
From their coverts warm and cunning,
From many a steamy couch of fern and many a
leafy lair.
They get them all together, and at last they’re
homeward bound ;
The music of their lowing fills the sounding hills
around ;
- misty rises like a phantom herd they
wind,
A sp~~ rid dog and horseman rousing stragglers
up behind.
Then the ringing voice of Teddy
“ Rouse them up there, Rowdy! Steady!”
And Rowdy’s bark imperious the big gorge
answers plain.
Over loam and sapling bridges,
Up the sidling on the ridges.
They spread and bunch and scatter, string, and
spread and bunch again.
Past the orchard, thro’ the sliprails, they go filing
one by one,
Their coats like satin gleaming in the newly-risen
sun ;
In the shed they line-up gladly, for none better
know than they
The sweet smell of the silo and the rustle of the
hay.
Then the warm white wreaths ascending,
And the voices gently blending
In cadence low and tuneful with the separator’s
hum.
Oh, the lilting and the singing
With the milkstrokes rhythmic ringing,
As the deft and supple-handed milkers make the
white froth come!
While the white mists yet are clinging to the
gullies down below,
And the waving tops are gleaming in the morn-
ing’s sunny glow;
While from the mottled mintwood comes the jay’s
sweet matin clear,
Or maggie pipes and warbles in the blackwood
standing near;
And the bleating and the lowing
Down the morning gale are going,
And gorges unto gorges on the wind the echoes
fling;
While the morning’s golden changes play along
the purple ranges
We are busy, busy milking down in Gippsland in
the spring.

Aboriginalities.
I read the paper every week,
I find it interesting ;
I love to hear of blokes out-back,
And whalers pub-bars breasting ;
Of kangaroos and cockatoos,
Emus, and other flyers;
In “ Aboriginalities,”
That home of cheerful liars.
Their simple truths are staggering,
Their cod-fish are appalling ;
Their drunks come off uninjured, though
Down deep mines they keep falling ;
The balmy coves out on the plains
Are past all classifying ;
And dogs and bunyips fill the page
Where these coves keep on lying.
I love their snakes, which are so long
They have perspective in them;
And even when these snakes are dead
It takes a week to skin them ;
I love to read of shearers with
Bush-rum infuriated ;
Life would be blank without that page
Where Rougemont graduated.

Machine Politics.
The object of government is good living.
The system of community-life is based on
the principle of protecting others in return
for self-protection. That involves a sacrifice
of individual freedom in some respects, in
order to gain unhampered freedom in other
respects. So government is devised to define
the character of the community’s protection,
the limits of the individual’s freedom, in the
form of law. Government is not a good
thing in itself. If the community were
sufficiently intelligent, its members would
rule themselves in relation to each other as
the members of an intelligent family rule
themselves in relation to each other— with-
out need of formal government or registered
law. The less government that is needed
the better. It does not profit to heap laws,
to enrol officials, just because the laws are
laws and the officials are officials. Every
working law is a restriction on somebody’s
freedom. Every official is maintained at
somebody’s cost. Unless the'law can show
its reason, the official his necessity, both are
noxious.
* * * *
The -democratic form of government is in
practice the best which the human brain has
devised. When every individual is called to
take his share in the business of government
in the making of laws, the presumption is
that the laws and the government will repre-
sent his interest in life to the extent of his
power to maintain or change them. The
unison or conflict of interests gives a result-
ant of community-action which represents
the community’s wishes more or less justly
in proportion as the machinery is more or
less perfect. The more intelligent the com-
munity, the better the machinery, and the
more profitable the government.
Much of the machinery of government is
comprised m the term politics. As the
object of government is good living, so the
object of politics is good government. The
community is the agent ; politics its means :
government its end. And just as an artisan’s
tool, while he is shaping his work, reacts on
the artisan aitering the conformation of his
and, the conformation of his brain—so the
politics with which a community shanes its
eii ot government react on the community.
Jiivery man who casts a vote, if the machin-
ery be perfect, wields an influence over the
government. Every man who casts a vote,
under ordinary circumstances, finds that the
vote wields an influence over himself. The
community’s politics are a factor in the
individual's education. They are indeed
a most valuable factor; in virtue of the
aw that exercise strengthens, responsibility
breeds power to meet it. Every man who
votes has cast upon him the duty of con-
sidering government, of weighing the can-
didates who ask to represent him ; and
in ordinary circumstances his interest
impels him to his duty. He desires
government which coincides with his in-
terest ; he realises that his vote will be
effective in proportion as his interest coin-
cides with the interest of the majority of
voters. And the process of voting develops
his intelligence, heightens his sense of com-
munal responsibility, and makes him a more
efficient citizen. Thus the democratic system
is calculated not only to secure better govern-
ment, but in the course of government to
secure a better community.
The intrusion of machine politics into
Australian government is to be deprecated
and resisted because machine politics not only
decrease the resultant of good government,
but also decrease the community’s power of
achieving good government They injure
both the community and the individual.
“ Machine politics ” is an American term to
indicate the system by which voters are
driven like sheep to the poll by
the “boss” of the “party.” The unintel-
ligent voter in America exercises no
discrimination whatever ; he votes as the
“ boss ” tells him, simply because the “ boss”
is the “boss.” The more intelligent voter
under machine-politics sacrifices his intelli-
gence on the altar of “party.” He votes
for this or that candidate, not because he ap-
proves of him, but because the “party bosses ”
teach him that he must put “party ” first, his
personal wishes and opinions last. Two
things result from this system of “machine
politics.” The first is that government, the
end of the community’s efforts, becomes it-
self a means—a means of enriching the
“ party bosses,” of securing their interests at
the expense of the community’s interest.
The country is subordinated to the “ party.”
The second result is that the individual voter,
no longer called upon to exercise his power
of judgment, becomes incapable of judgment.
He sees good government thwarted ; he sees
the machinery of government used for the
aggrandisement of individuals ; he sees the
community robbed and corrupted ; and, so
far from protesting against public spoliation
for private benefit, his thought is to be a
better “party ” man, that he may share in
the “ party ” spoils.
♦ * * *
It is easy to see why a dishonest press and
dishonest politicians advocate machine-poli-
tics and the “ party ” system,—shepherding
voters without opinions of their own, num-
bered and regimented and led to the poll to
vote in a block for the “ticket” which the
“bosses” give them. In a democracy, as
everywhere else, dishonesty cares nothing
for good government as long as its own ends
are served. And enlightened voters, desir-
ing good government, exercising their own
brains, voicing their own individual opinions,
are a constant menace to dishonesty. But
if the voter can be taught that thinking for
himself is a crime, that blind obedience is a
virtue, that a “party” shibboleth always
comes before the country’s welfare—then
what a potent weapon does the voter become
in the hands of dishonesty, eager to make
laws to suit itself, to divert " the oublic
revenue into its own pockets !
“Party organisation has already pro-
gressed far in Australia. Notoriously un-
worthy men have been sent as representa-
tives to the Commonwealth Parliament—
because they placated or represented “party
bosses,” and the mob of voters was driven
by the “ party ” drum to vote for them. In
some of the State Parliaments, for “ party ”
ends, the cry of “ Freetrade v. Protection ”
is still maintained ; though the State
Parliaments can now decide nothing
either for Freetrade or for Protection.
The plan is one which sensible men,
who value their own independence and
the community s interest, should actively
oppose. The only vital issue which can
divide Australia permanently is the issue of
Liberal v. Tory, Progress v. Stagnation—an
issue rooted in humanity. Local interests are
different, and often opposed ; the national in-
terest is one and single. When there is ques-
tion of the means of attaining it, there are
really only two parties—those who are con-
tent with the means we have, and those who
desire to secure better means—the eternal
Man Who Moves and the Man Who Stands
Still. And, whichever side he takes, The
Bulletin counsels every voter to whom
machine-politics are preached for private
ends to answer in Ingersoll’s words : “I’ve
got a thinker of my own ; and 1 mean to do
my own thinking.”

Fred. Glynn was probationary assistant store-
keeper at N.S.W. State Coast Hospital at Little
Bay ; and on January 17, 1900, after six months
trial, was informed that his services were not
satisfactory, and, on the recommendation of
Chief Medical Officer Thompson, his appointment
was not confirmed. Glynn appealed to the
Public Service Board and stated in writing that
his services were unsatisfactory because he had
consistently refused to allow the stores contractor
to supply the hospital with food unfit for human
consumption, and not up to sample. He also
deliberately charged his superior officer, C. G.
Willman, with having obstructed him in such
refusal, declaring that that officer had tried to in-
timidate him into passing bad goods, and that
Willman was conniving at the acceptance, by the
hospital, of stores that were infamous in quality
and short in quantity.
» * * *
Nothing could be more direct, and yet the
officer who was accused was not even suspended.
One, Brodie, was sent out to make a departmental
investigation, and from what information this
paper can gather, to hush the thing up. He is
said not to have called the Medical Superinten-
dent, and excused himself for failing to do so on
the ground that Glynn (at this time an outside
civilian) was the prosecutor, and should have had
his witnesses ready. In other words, the Chief
Medical. Officer, it would seem, though informed
that an institution supposed to be under his con-
trol was in a frightful state of mismanagement,
didn’t start a thorough investigation, but was
willing to sit down and listen if a private person
did his work for him. And, by way of helping
that private person to do this, it is alleged that he
wasn’t even notified of the day of inquiry. He
only heard of it by accident. Glynn’s address
was at the Public Service Board’s office, but the
Health Office was too tired to use the telephone.
But the thing would not lie down, and the Public
Service Board held two inquiries, and made two
memorable reports. The first was dated August
2nd, 1900, the other came later. Though this
paper has asked for a copy of that second report,
the See Government refuses to allow the document
to be even seen, let alone published.
* * » *
In the first report, that of August 2, 1900, the
Public Service Board says :
The Matron, in her evidence, says she held Willman In
contempt with regard to stores. Her opinion of the
goods supplied is as follows :
Poultry: atrocious, old, small, tough, and as hard as
wood ; vegetables: peas as hard as bullets, cabbages old,
vegetable-marrows washy and full of fibre, turnips so hard
you could strike a match upon them ; butter, rancid ;
fish, very bad and unfit for human consumption, and had
to be returned nearly every day ; fruit, bad ; vermicelli
and macaroni so bad that when soup was made of it the
nurses refused to drink it, as weevils were floating on the
top. Other officers describe the fish as bad, and sometimes
stinking ; vegetables slimy, and in a state of fermenta-
tion ; potatoes, rotten ; butter not eatable, and hardly
any of the goods up to standard. Everything had to be
weighed or counted, as many articles were often short in
weight. It was a usual thing for the hospital authorities
to have to send to Sydney to purchase goods in lieu of
the articles supplied by Mr. Kidman, and refused delivery,
and thus a great loss of time and considerable inconveni-
ence and expense was entailed, and, if anything, a gain
to the contractor, as the goods bought at the contractor’s
risk were nearly always cheaper and better than what
were supplied.
In the opinion of the Board the evidence points very
clearly to a partisanship on the part of Mr. Willman
towards the contractor. Constant bickerings were going
on between Mr. Glynn and Mr. Willman as to the refusal
or otherwise of the provisions supplied —Glynn being in
nearly every instance correct when the matter was re-
ferred to the Medical Superintendent. Reports were
constantly sent to the Health Office by Dr. Violette res-
pecting the bad and inferior provisions supplied, and, in
some instances, samples were sent, but with little or no
result. In one instance Mr. Kidman was threatened to be
fined the next time he was complained of, but, on the
next time arriving, he was merely cautioned.
Mr. Willman, it appears to the Board, has been too
long at the institution, as he has apparently the idea that
all that is required of him is to superintend and not to
work, and the Board have therefore decided that he be
transferred to some other position in the Public Service
at a reduced salary.
Mr. Glynn, no doubt, has done good work in endeavor-
ing to expose the contractor’s attempts to palm off bad
and inferior provisions, and is entitled to some considera-
tion. The Board are making further inquiries with regard
to him, and will deal with his case in a further minute.
In the meantime they recommend that he be paid three
months’ salary at the rate he was formerly receiving.
At the conclusion of the inquiry it was ascertained that
the Tender Board proposed to accept the tender of Mr.
Arthur Kidman for the supply of groceries to the hospital
for another year, and that no exception was taken to its
acceptance by the Health Office authorities, and the
Board suggested to the Honorable the Premier that fur-
ther action might be deferred until he had perused the
evidence taken at this inquiry, and the report thereon
Mr. Arthur Kidman, hearing of this, asked that the in-
quiry might be re-opened, in order that he might call
witnesses in his defence. This was consented to. Mr.
Kidman gave evidence, and endeavored to show that
there was a conspiracy on the part of the employes of the
hospital to injure him by rejecting provisions which were
in accordance with his contract. This, in the opinion of
the Board, he failed to prove. Permission was given him
to call any evidence he pleased which might throw a light
on the defence he set up, and to cross-examine any of the
witnesses already examined, and at his request the fur-
ther hearing was adjourned, when, after taking further
evidence, the inquiry was concluded.
In the opinion of the Board, Mr. Kidman did not rebut
any of the evidence given at the inquiry, and altogether
failed to prove his defence. The Board therefore invite
the attention of the Government to the evidence, so that
the question whether Mr. Kidman should be allowed to
take up any future Government contracts may receive
due consideration.
* * * *
Nevertheless, Glynn, in the coarse language of
Woolloomooloo, got the boot, and has it yet. He
is still walking the streets of Sydney, unem-
ployed, and his sole reward has been six months’
salary at the rate he received as a probationer at
the Coast Hospital—six months’ salary in over 16
months. Willman, charged not only by Glynn,
but also by the Public Service Board in the above
report, with what, reduced to plain English,
amounts to wilfully conniving at thefeedingof hos-
pital patients with food unfit for human consump-
tion, and causing the Government heavy loss,
drew full pay till sometime in March, 1901, when
he was suspended—nearly 14 months after the
charges were laid against him.
* * * *
Asked by a Bulletin man to explain the long
delay, the Public Service Board replies that it has
done its work. It investigated and reported,
and the rest was for the permanent head and the
Government to do. It was declared that these
shameful practices had existed for seven years.
The P.S.B. had got to the bottom of them in about
12 weeks, and made its recommendations for the
punishment of the guilty parties, and had also
secured the cancelling of the contract. Asked
why Glynn had not received from itself the con-
sideration recommended by itself, the P.S.B.
replies that Glynn had been paid six months
salary—in over 16 months —at the rate he received
at the Coast Hospital. Griffiths, M.L.A.,
stated in N.S.W. Assembly that the adoption of
Glynn’s suggestions had resulted in a saving of
over £6OO per annum on the face of the contract.
What further saving resulted through the Govern-
ment receiving full value for its money has
not been calculated. Glynn’s action secured for
the patients proper food, and generally made the
Hospital a fit place for human beings to be
invalided in. Nevertheless, this service has not
secured him an appointment in the department he
has served so well, and he is still walking about
the streets of Sydney, picking up casual work for
the support of himself and his little child.
* * * *
The secretary of the P.S.B. says the Board is
going to do something for Glynn, some day.
Apparently the truth is that the P.S.B. does not
want to give Glynn a billet. It pleads he is an
indifferent penman and slovenly book-keeper.
Also that he is slow. The sublime impudence of a
Board that has taken over 14 months to procure
the suspension of a man charged with such
offences as it charges against 'illman, talking
about anybody being slow, is beyond comment.
The P.S.B. is not going to employ a man who,
in its own opinion, broke up a system of gross
corruption which had been going on for seven
years because he is not a pretty writer,
and is slow. Has the P.S.B. no fellow-
feeling ? This writer had some of its own
caligraphy in his possession, and if Glynn’s
is any worse, the Board ought to supply him with
a type-writer. Glynn’s apparent offence is that
he went about his reforming in an irreverent
manner; and the P.S.B. apparently likes crawlers
and things that will lick its varnished boots. And
the P.S.B. is a fool. If it throws Glynn over-
board, as it has apparently done, what other officer,
as long as the Board lasts, is likely to come for-
ward with ideas for reform ? Under the same
conditions any private employer would promptly
reward Glynn. The P.S.B. goes out of its way
not to further employ him.
* * • *
Then The Bulletin man saw Dr. Ashburton
Thompson, the “permanent head” of the Health
Department. Asked to explain the long delay in
oonvictmg Willman, or acquitting him and clear-
ing his character, he shrugged his shoulders and
said it was a matter for the P.S.B. Informed
that the Board threw all the blame on him, he
declared that such conduct was monstrous. The
P.S.B. had held the inquiry; it was created to
tt ll 1, 10 Service. His affair was Public
Health. As for what happened at the Coast
Hospital the Medical Supt. had ample powers.
(Shrug.) The trouble was all due to the Reid
Government ignoring his minute to the effect that
there was no one in the Service fit to take charge
of the Coast Hospital. The Reid Government
had insisted on a man being appointed from the
service. Dr. Yiolette was the senior officer, and
this (shrug) was the result. He didn’t remember
Glynn, but had adttazy recollection of Willman.
Later on, his memory became more clear, and he
said Glynn was no beauty (the Hr. - is exceedingly
charming in every way), and that “poor old
Willman had got a lot more than he deserved.
He didn t explain how Dr. Violette had hung
up the finishing of the case for 16 months. He
denied that Glynn had done anything for the
benefit of the Hospital, and said it was all due
iu hu “’ ? r " Thompson. It was also quite untrue
that bad provisions ever reached the patients.
(I he matron swore they reached the nurses, and
that the soup occasionally had weevils floating on
it. This writer was once a patient, and he prefers
to take the matron’s word.) He once more
declared that it was not his fault there had
been any delay ; he was quite powerless to hurrv
things on. 1 his helplessness of the permanent head
was pathetic, but when asked if he could have
suspended Willman, had that storekeeper bashed
him (the doctor) on the nose, the Chief Medical
Officer admitted that he could have suspended
him instantly. Aj-sked was it not strange he could
not do the same when Willman was charged with
conniving at fraud and supplying bad food to sick
and dying people, the doctor shrugged his shoul-
ders and said Ihe Bulletin was a very brilliant
paper. Which, although very true," is quite
irrelevant.
* * * *
The Thompson potentate cannot escape front
his own admission that, had Willman been guiltv
of violence to HIM, he could have dealt with him
at once. If he could in the one case, he could in
the other, and in much less than 16 months—had
1m wanted to. Presumably, he didn’t want to.
A permanent head ” that doesn’t-want-to to such
an extent, and in such an awful business, ought to
be shifted The permanent trunk would be a lot
better without him. His admission also bears out
the statement of the P.S.B. secretary and Mr
Gritchett Walker that the responsibility of the
whole disgraceful delay rests on the shoulders of
Dr. Ashburton Thompson, Chief Medical Officer.
* * * *
The Bulletin has twice tried to obtain a copy
of the second report of the Public Service Board
on the Willman-Glynn case and the Coast
Hospital Stores Contract, which it has reason to
believe contains startling revelations and most
drastic recommendations against officers in high
places. But the report has been refused—it is
informed, by special instructions of Premier John
See, who is understood to be a near relative by
marriage of Arthur Kidman, whose contract was
cancelled at the instance of the P. 5.8., and over
whose provisions all the row arose. Mr. Critchett
Walker explained it was because the was
sub judice; “poor old Willman was being tried
for his billet, and his poor little wife had been up
crying and entreating,” and the official mind felt
quite sorry for her.
* * * *
When the story of the Stores contract was
AT TA m kY S-W V As sembly by Griffiths,
M.G.A., the Lyne-See gang took the
contract away from Arthur Kidman, under-
stood to be a near relative by mar-
riage of present Premier John See ; and gave
a lot of it to .Tames Kidman, brother of Arthur
Kidman, and also related by marriage, The Bul-
letin believes, to present Premier John See
Taking everything into account, The Bul-
letin suggests to the electors that it would be
an interesting experiment to wipe out the whole
See gang, with the exception of Crick and the
O Sullivan, at the next State eleetion, and get a
Premier who hasn’t relatives in the provision trade,
rheabuses complained of are said to have been going
on for seven years. They were brought to light
m January, 1900, and no one was suspended or
dismissed except the man who brought them to
light— tin March, 1901. The Lyne-See and See
Ministries have been in power all that time. If
they aren’t responsible, who is ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Cheap Sailor-Man.
f J, ve th . e cr ® w of a British ship were up
at Melb. District Court, the other day, charged
with refusing duty. Whilst the iniquitous system
obtains on the Australian coast of allowing
shark owners and charterers to run vessels be-
tween inter-state ports with crews signed on at
the rates of pay obtaining in European waters
such prosecutions are inevitable. The storv is
always much the same. Crews sign on in an


English port for a period of (usually) two years,
at about £3 10s. or *£4 10s. a month for firemen
and sailors respectively. It is understood by the
men (though it isn’t specified) that the proposed
voyage will be entirely a deep-water trip. The
fact that the vessel is to be chartered on this
coast for a period of, perhaps, six months and up-
wards is most carefully kept dark. Then the
men find that they are trading on the Australian
coast at far less than Australian wages—that
they are not only being underpaid, but are help-
ing to cut down local wages and “turning
dog ” on their class—and they naturally assume
that they weren’t informed of the real pro-
gramme of the voyage for the express purpose
of getting them at low wages. As a matter
of course, trouble follows. In these cases the
actual master of the ship is usually unable
to appear against the men, owing to his name
being pro tem on the ship’s register as purser, or
in some other subordinate capacity. The prose-
cutions are carried on by the man who is known
as the exempt master (shipped for the purpose of
evading pilotage dues), who has practically no
connection with the vessel at all, other than taking
her m and out of pilotage waters. This system
has increased amazingly of late years, owing to
the loose way in which Navigation Acts are ad-
ministered, and its extinction can’t come too soon.
The cheap imported sailor man is almost as great
a grievance as any other cheap imported laborer -
the Kanaka included. The difference is that the
sugar-planting Kanaka comes here for the
express purpose of being a cheap toiler; the
sailor-man often finds himself filling that
character wholly against his will. The short
and simple remedy is a Minimum Wage Law for
all seafarers, which will apply to every vessel
while trading between Australian ports —a law
which will begin to apply the moment a vessel
touches at its first Australian port of call, and
apply through the whole intermediate period.
And this law should absolutely override any con-
trary agreement which may exist between owners
and crew. When once a vessel begins journeying.
between Australian ports cheap-labor agreements
should be mere wrapping-paper, and should remain
so till the ship leaves these waters. And, if it is
found that the extra wage paid while in Australian
waters is afterwards deducted, the law should
have a heavy fine to collect from that vessel on her
next appearance, even if the masts and the big
anchor have'to be sold by auction to recover the
amount.
The Case of L. T. Heydon.
There has been received at this office an enor-
mously long letter from Mr. Louis Francis
Heydon, with reference to his connection with
the Moss case—the case in which he was engaged
on one side and took commission from the other
side, and was thus interested in both sides—an ar-
rangement which ended in the refunding of the
commission, a £SO fine, and some very severe
language from the Bench. Mr. Heydon requests
that, “ in fair play,” his letter shall be published.
One of the griefs of a newspaper office consists of
the men who, being commented on to the extent
of a few inches of space, send a reply about a
fathom long, and demand “in fairness” that it
shall be printed. Mr. L. F. Heydon explains in
a general way that he didn’t start the Moss suit,
that lie didn’t get all, or anything like all, of the
£SOOO costs, that he was of great service in mini-
mising costs in various directions, &c., all of which
are quite irrelevant to anything this paper said.
The points of Mr. Heydon’s letter which seem to
be really relevant are these :
I have been blamed for accepting commission from pro-
fessional gentlemen to whom I recommended clients, and
they also see the costliness of the litigation, and they
think that my receiving commission has increased the
total costs. That is not so. The gentlemen in question
lost what they paid me ; and the estate would have been
none the richer had they retained all their costs
My own bills, throughout the four years of the
suit, totalled £1622; of which barristers’ fees con-
sumed over £7OO ; and -I received as commission
£320 more, making a total of £1220 I may
quote some instances of my efforts to keep down the
costs. Four of the adult children of the testator had
consulted me, and under the statement of claim as drawn
the law forbade me to act for them, so that I sent them
to other solicitors. Two other adult children did not
consult me, but sought other advisers. In the end, the
total costs of these two latter children was £BSO 7s. 5d.,
or £425 per head, while the total costs of the four chil-
dren who had consulted me was £662, or £165 10s. per
head. ... To some persons the taxations seem a grave
point. During the course of the suit taxations took place
live times. Only on the last occasion is there any com-
plaint made of me, and the total of all the bills at that
time for taxation in which interest could be supposed to
influence my conduct was £460. On that occasion, for
the first time, the Master in Equity gave directions that
the taxation of such bills should be attended by the
plaintiff’s solicitor alone—that would be myself or my
clerk. I had no reason to expect this change, which
was made for economy’s sake, and, in fact, I did not
know it, my managing clerk not informing me of it. . . .
It is not the solicitor, but the taxing officer, who taxes.
He is a most experienced and capable official, who goes
through the bill item by item, and taxes off improper
items, whether they be objected to or not; though I ad-
mit that the solicitor attending is there for the purpose
of assisting the taxing officer in his taxation. ... At the
taxation in question all the bills filed were most impar-
tially reduced by a percentage hardly varying. That is
to say, the bills of the solicitors to whom 1 had sent
clients were reduced by the taxing officer in the same
proportion as the bills of the other solicitors.
The relevant part of Mr. L. F. Heydon’s state-
ment appears, therefore, to amount to this: The
solicitors whom he imported into the case charged
only a very moderate amount for the work they
did. Compared to other solicitors in the case
their moderation, according to Mr. L. F. Hey-
don, amounted to a disease. And out of their
scanty payment lie had the awful front to take the
large sum of £320. His case seems to be that
instead of shamefully plundering the estate he
shamefully plundered his fellow-solicitors. And
out of the £320 which he thus unjustifiably re-
ceived he seems to have returned £977 to the
estate. As to whether there was any reason why
the parties to the suit who consulted Mr. L.
F. Heydon should not have had one solicitor
among them, as seems to have been their original
intention, and whether, by introducing them to a
solicitor apiece (Mr. L. F. Heydon received com-
mission from all these solicitors), he wasn’t
bringing various extra and needless solicitors
into the business, Mr. L. F. Heydon says
nothing. In one part of his letter he
certainly says that every party having sepa-
rate interests must be separately represented,
but it doesn’t follow that the interests which Mr.
L. F. Heydon entrusted to all this batch of soli-
citors (from whom he received commission) were
separate interests. And if they were not, then he
did heap needless, costs (of which he received
a large share) upon the estate —unless four or five
solicitors cost just the same as one. Mr. L. F.
Heydon has declared that his commission didn’t
increase the bills of the very economical soli-
citors whom he introduced into the suit. If
it can be further proved that all these
very economical solicitors whom Mr. L. F.
Heydon introduced were essential, or, if they
weren’t all essential, that the extra ones made no
difference wtiatever in the expenses, then Mr. L.
F. Heydon will be fully acquitted of doing any
injury to Moss’s estate. ' And, by way of variety,
he will be convicted of doing the injury to his
professional brethren instead. Certainly, this
paper would rather see a solicitor eat another soli-
citor than see him eat the public, but the differ-
ence, though to the public interest, doesn’t neces-
sarily raise its opinion of the solicitor very much.

X A Spectre from ’9l. /
N.S. W. Ex-Treasurer William MM ill an, ofiill
men in the world, lately raised his brief figure in
the Federal House of Representatives, on the
Freetrade side, and made a long and whirling
address on the advantages of a Freetrade policy.
And M'Millan, of all men in the world, said that
he was a person who had always been a Freetrader
and who had walked consistently in the narrow
path of Shoddy. And yet MMtllan was Trea-
surer of N.S.W. for a number of years, and his
tariff heavily protected bricks, beer, bacon, hams,
tongues, biscuits, butter, candles, cement, cheese,
chemicals, cider, cigars, cigarettes, tobacco, con-
fectionery, cornflour, fish, almost every kind of
fruit, almost every kind of wooden or galvanised-
iron wares, preserves, condensed milk, molasses,
treacle, sugar, paints and oils, salt, varnish, white
lead, wine, newspapers, and other things. He
didn’t need to protect these things for the sake
of revenue; a very moderate amount of direct
taxation and one or two countervailing excise
duties would have enabled him to dispense
with every protective item in his tariff.
He certainly didn’t protect the things that he
imported himself—if local industries had arisen in
that line to supply the people with employment it
would doubtless have been bad for his importing
business. But outside his importing business
there were very few industries that he didn’t
assist with some'measure of Protection. And
M’Mtllan declares that Protection in any shape
is injurious and a curse to the country, and poses
as a man who has always been of that opinion and
has neVer fallen away into fiscal darkness. So the
spectre of the old MMtllan tariff rises up before
Softgoods William and offers him these alterna-
tives :
(1) Either he protected all theie goods, believing that
Protection was a curse and a disaster, and thereby
wilfully aud maliciously laid himself out to injure and
impoverish the country. In which case it is difficult to
distinguish between him and any dynamiter or other
public enemy.
(2) Or he protected all these industries believing that
Protection was good, which implies that he is a man who
doesn’t adhere to the truth when he says he believes
Protection is bad. In that case it may possibly be inferred
that he tried to think he believed in Freetrade in order to
avoid establishing Protection all round, which would have
damaged his own importing- business. And that puts him
in the position of being a man who deliberately sacrificed
the interests of N.S.W., so far as they were sacrificed by
his failure to protect the local softgoods manufacture, in
order that his Calico Jimmy connection might prosper.
And that again makes him a traitor, and a very mercenary
and sordid one, to the country which he represented
(3) Or else he hadn’t the courage of his .opinions ; or
else again, outside his own Calico Jimmy interests, he had
no real opinions, in which case all the froth and fury of
his Freetrade orations were mere self-seeking and self-
interest, and his political career was simply a means
towards his private ends—mostly calico ends.
The Bulletin has no desire to call M’Millan
bad names, but it can’t help hearing the names
his own tariff calls him. And it can’t help hear-
ing the names which the same tariff calls Bruce
Smith, who was also Treasurer under it, and took
his share of the responsibility of it. No man who
joined the Parkes Ministry, and took the responsi-
bility of the Parkes tariff, can claim to have
been a consistent Freetrader without the old
tariff arising out of its tomb to call him a double-
dealer, or an incapable, or a person who dared
not do what he believed was right. The virtuous
pretensions of the remnant of the old Parkes
gang—the gang that was responsible for the pro-
tective Parkes tariff —to be consistent Freetraders
of many years’ standing ought to sicken any decent
Cornstalk citizen who knows the history of his
own country.
Unclaimed Balances.
“South Australia” writes re unclaimed bank
balances : By Act 539 of 1891 and section 185
of Act of 1892, South Australia compelled banks
and others to disgorge into the Treasury any un-
claimed balances they held. £16,000 was brought
to light by the Act of 1891, £6OOO of which was
promptly claimed by its proper owners, and the
balance the Treasury holds awaiting claimants.
It was the publicity which the Government gave
to the matter which enabled those owners to get
their due. They might have waited long enough
till the banks informed them that money was due
to them. I need scarcely say the banks fought
this Act bitterly, the late Samuel Tomkin-
SON, ex-bank manager, and then M.L.C., leading
the forces; but the Act was carried mainly because
of a scandal which came to light some little time
before. It appears a man was entrusted with a
large sum of money some 30 years ago, and sent
to our south-eastern district to disburse it. He
lodged it in a bank, and afterwards died suddenly.
As no trace of the money was found among his
papers it was assumed he had embezzled it, and as
the bank did nothing to clear his memory his
family bore the stigma until accident revealed the
fact that the bank had foully wronged the dead
man by silently retaining the money. And the
management showed not a vestige of shame over
the infamous transaction. This is no fairy tale.
If your readers will refer to our Auditor-General’s
11th, 12th, and 13th reports, 1893-4-5, Parlia-
mentary papers No. 4, pages XLI., XLLI.,
XIII., and XI., they will find the above corrobo-
rated, and will also get information respecting ihe
workings of the Acts. Yet I see that your
Sydney Telegraph denounces the proposal lately
made in England to stop such shameful practices
as an organised attempt to plunder and despoil
the banks, Some people have a curiously inverted
way of looking at things.
Politics and Platitudes.
The average calibre of the Federal representatives
from New South Wales is a figure which, in mere
contemplation, is humiliating. Sid. Smith,
Wilks, Gould, Neild, Pulsford— if all the rest
were Solons, these names would pull the average
below zero. But even Neild is a statesman com-
pared with the average candidate for the State
Assembly. About half the lawyers and aldermen
of N.S.W., and all the men who have ever held a
bottle or a sponge for a candidate, are already
announced, and their platforms are gs ordinary as
their names. They are, without exception, in
favor of amendment of nearly everything, and
particulars about the exact direction in which they
propose to amend any tiling are as scarce as bear’s
eggs. In a hazy fashion and with an entire
absence of detail, they favor “amelioration of the
laws for the benefit of the masses ” —and they are
all simply yearning for “ liberal legislation.” It
is a good word —“liberal.” It seems to imply
something a lot better for everybody than any-
body has had before, and it is so useful
that the slowest and most retrograde human tomb-
stone in politics calls himself Liberal nowadays.
“Liberal legislation,” a “progressive policy,”
“judicious economy,” and “ a wise system of re-
trenchment ” are the stale stock-in-trade of the
drag-net politician. So are these beautiful general
phrases: “ the development of the resources of
this great country,” “lightening the taxpayers’
burdens,” “promoting settlement,” and a “care-
ful regard for the great producing industries,”
likewise “the encouragement of commerce.”
'Some of the larger men having gone away, the
small, dull platitudinarians are even more numer-
ous than usual, and their dead platitudes stand up
like a forest of ring-barked gums in a flat country.
Nothing could be much more shadowy than the
programme of Premier See, except it be the pro-
gramme of would - be Premier Lee. See and
Lee both want to “develop the resources of the
country by wise legislation,” and See and
Lee each says that his legislation will be
found remarkably wise when it is revealed.
And that’s where the Labor-party will score.
While other candidates talk platitudes about
developing the resources of the country, the
Labor-party, with a visible platform and a solid
vote, should be able to top the poll in enough
electorates to give New South Wales progressive
legislation for the next three years. The
Bulletin has said before, this next election will
give that party the chance of a lifetime. It wants
a John Burns or Dick Seddon (the old-time
Dick Seddon) to lead it, and it wants a financial
policy (hitherto its only financial policy has con-
sisted in having no opinion about the tariff ques-
tion, aud now even that is gone, for there is no
tariff question left to have no opinion about). Witli
these two things it should be able to blot the old
indefinite potterers off the political slate.

The Groans of B Smith.
Bruce Smith, who promises to annex the leader-
ship of the rank Tory party in the House of
Reps., threatens an anti-Labor move when occa-
sion seems to require it. To the statement that
the Federal Labor Party will “hold the balance
of power ” and will give support in return for
concessions, he replies: “There are, it will be
found, too many thoughtful men returned to the
Federal Parliament—men determined to check
these methods at all hazards —to admit of this very
sanguine little party selling its support from time
to time for political concessions.” Perhaps;
though they don’t look like it—and the Laborites
are, besides, getting used to that threat; they
heard it first eight or ten years ago. But, on the
general question, as to the awful immorality which
B. Smith professes to see in the party’s tactics,
there’s another side. Thus Mr. B. Smith :
The effect of this rule (to vote solid) is to lead fre-
quently, and possibly in most important issues, to govern-
ment by minority—the one thing above all others that
the principle of democracy was designed to make im-
possible. A great question of State policy might come
up in the Commonwealth House of Representatives.
There might be among the 72 members 28 ayes and 24
noes, and of the remaining 20 Labor members 9 might be
ayes and il noes—at heart. If the Labor Party were free
to vote according to conscience, the result would De :
28 and 9 ayes = 37
24 and 11 noes = 35
giving a majority of two for the ayes. If the Labor
Party apply the caucus so that the majority of that party
rules, they will give :
24 and 20 = noes 44
28 and 0 = ayes 28 '
a majority of sixteen for the noes. Thus, what would
have been a majority for the ayes becomes a majority for
the noes. And this is Democracy !
This is all very true, and the Labor Party’s solid
vote is quite undemocratic. But the amusing
feature _ of the case is that the dull B. Smith
. thinks it is all a special iniquity of the Labor
Party, and doesn’t understand that he and nearly
everybody is doing exactly the same thing.
For instance, suppose while Reid was Premier
some Oppositionist had moved that Reid’s policy of
spending £BOO,OOO a year of loan money for ordinary
expenditure purposes was a fraud and an infamy
—a motion which, if carried, would have ejected
Reid and put the Protectionist party in power.
Possibly among 40 miscellaneous members, not
counting the Reid party, there would be 27 ayes
and 13 noes. And among, say, 60 Foreign-traders
present, including B. Smith, there might be—if
the Foreign-traders were at liberty to vote accord-
ing to their consciences—4o ayes and 20 noes.
Result: —
27 and 40 ayes = 67.
13 and 20 noes = 33.
Majority of 34 for the ayes. But the Foreign-
traders, including B. Smith, would all vote “ No ”
—not because the caucus told them to, but because
George Reid told them to, and in order to keep
the Foreign-trade gang in office. And the result
would be 73 noes to 27 ayes. The difference is that
in one case a great part of the Labor Party fre-
quently outrages its conscience by voting the way
the Labormajority bids it. And the other parties—
including the one that B. Smith belongs to—quite
as often outrage their consciences by voting the way
the party boss bids them. Where 21 Labor mem-
bers are present, not more than 10 can be called
upon to vote against their convictions in order to
keep the party together. In a party of 21 Foreign-
traders (including B. Smith) it can easily happen
that 12 or 15, or perhaps 20, vote against their
convictions—to keep the party together, and the
party’s boss in office, and the hated other fellow out
of office. The Labor party’s policy is bad, and the
policy of the other parties is similar, only
worse. But the other parties started the system.
The most visible outward difference is that the
Labor party votes solid after discussion, and the
other parties don’t discuss but vote as the boss
tells them.
“ Bull’s Wool ” cries from the West:
The only conclusion one can come to after reading the
evidence to the Western Lands Commission at Hay is that
fanning and grazing are equally a gamble. Seasons can
never be relied upon for even three months at a stretch.
Except in some isolated instances, no one has done any
good who has had to make much outlay—the record has
been one monotonous failure after another. “ Big risks,
big returns,” is an axiom of all business-men, therefore
give the man in the West a show. Let him have land at
a nominal rental, tenant-right in improvements, and a
long lease, and the chances are he won’t starve if he
got a decent area (say a 10-mile block). If good induce-
ments are not held out, the land can’t be taken up by
bona-fide tenants, because it won’t make a living except
under nominal expenditure. It is better to take a little
rent than have the country abandoned, and not only non-
producing, but a harbor for vermin of all descriptions.
Moreover, money is very tight for Western properties.
Banks and financial companies have been bitten until
they are “ not taking any,” so there is little or no hope of
financial help. The abandonment of the country is not
over yet unless some strong inducement is given. Many
of the large holdings are only waiting to see how the
Government is going to act on the report of the Lands
Commission, and, if no help comes, lots will have to
pass in their checks. Each Minister for Lands in turn is
going to solve the problem, but until one arises who has
eaten tinned dog, suffered from Barcoo rot, and “ dropped
his bundle ” by personal experience in the West, “ there is
one hope, and only one,” as the hymn says, and that’s
Buckley’s.
A Victorian paper called Woman’s Sphere
breaks out in its May issue with an appeal to all
women to sool on the authorities to a more rigid
enforcement of the law re criminal assaults on
young girls, which is about as superfluous as a fur
overcoat in Gehenna. And, strangely enough,
this moral and globular publication makes not one
single illusion to the fact that an enormous pro-
portion of the alleged cases of assault on girls
■prove to be lying accusations concocted by malicious
and dirty-minded females—often levelled at com-
plete strangers out of a mere horrible desire for
notoriety. And even when the unsavoury female
admits her perjury, she isn’t prosecuted by the
astounding rulers of this country. Also, in a very
large number of cases where convictions are ob-
tained, there is good reason to believe that the
conviction were wrongfully obtained. The ob-
jectionable she-perjurer knows that she runs no
risk even when she is bowled out, and as a result
she is numerous, and out of a multitude of girl
perjurers some are bound to escape discovery.
Woman’s Sphere need not worry about the need
for enforcing the law against men who assault
girls—the law is so well enforced already that the
Australian man has every chance to get seven
years whether he assaults a girl or not. A paper
that wants to sool the local girl on to make more
charges against men, has a capacity for carrying
buckets of salt water to the sea that rises to the
level of genius.

Nothing except Christian burial could have been
more dismal than the first debate in Australia’s
first Parliament. The standard was no higher
than that of the church literary society. In the
House of Reps, the speeches upon the Address-in-
Reply were severely platitudinarian. W. H.
Groom, of Queensland, mumbled on in the man-
ner of “ the lean and slipper’d pantaloon.” Most
of his remarks fell in childish treble whispers into
the thin hair on the head of Treasurer Turner,
who sat immediately below him. Crouch, of
Victoria, at once plunged into the mighty national
question of the pay of the Victorian Artillerymen
who happen to have votes in the district for which
he sits. Reid was amusing in a way, as all good
clowns should be. He worked hard, like the
funny man in the play, and became damp with
dishonest perspiration, but his efforts to make the
derned thing go were lost. In the Senate a worse
state of affairs existed. Simon Fraser made a
disconnected screech about all things under the
sun, and Gould, Neild, and Millen had all the
cheerfulness of a tea-meeting under chloroform.
♦
Rightly the See Govt, commuted the death sen-
tence passed on Ernest Montgomery Jones,
convicted, but with a recommendation to mercy,
of having shot Alfred Pittman, at Tamworth.
And a point that should be early taken is that
where a jury recommends to mercy the death sen-
tence should not be pronounced by the Judge, but
reserved for Cabinet consideration. As matters
are, the prisoner is sentenced to death, even when
the case is one where it is practically certain that
the sentence will not be carried out ; and then he
is put in irons by way of going through the pre-
liminary torture, and kept in them for weeks
until the painfully-slow wheels of Government
procedure have time to roll over his case.
“ S.S.”: The proclamation of the Commonwealth
in Sydney was diverted into a grand gluttonous
and guzzling glorification of the swaddy. The
opening of the Commonwealth Parliament in
Melbourne was forgotten in a great abasement of
fat toads before the children of a king. The Com-
monwealth (shade of O. Cromwell !) was nothing
—nobody remembered it, nobody cared a two-
penny objurgation about its claims, its dignity.
There was nothing seen or thought of but a royal
Duke and a royal Duchess surrounded by gaudy
satellites, around whom again assembled the grey
toads balanced on their paunches, whilst the crowd
gathered beyond and craned its million necks,
giraffe-like, in its vulgar frenzy, sweating to catch
one glimpse of a royalty. Australia ! Where was
she during all this ? I pictured her a deserted
figure standing afar off, her stern, white face
turned from the saturnalia of fuss and grease,
waiting for that time when her people should go
back to her, penitent, like prodigals who have
been eating husks which even the swine reject.
♦
“Melb.”: There is already urgent necessity for
an overhaul of the Press telegraphic arrangements
in regard to the Australian Parliament. Those
arrangements are wholly inadequate to meet any
strain. I will confine myself to Sydney. The
telegraphic department has made no special
arrangements worth noting for such a tremendous
new development as the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment. The department seems to think that Par-
liamentary telegraphy is going to be nothing more
than the ordinary thing. I write on Friday.
Parliament is up till Wednesday. The three
nights’ experience have been enough. Officials
complain that the wires were overloaded. Yet a
debate on an Address, as every pressman knows, is
mere mush compared with what is to follow when
big questions come up. lam informed that the
Sydney Telegraph complained of getting im-
portant copy two hours late, and too late
for the paper. Some Parliamentary copy
has actually been lost and cannot be
traced at all in the Department. The assumption
of the Sydney papers was that the admir-
able arrangements in Sydney are paralleled
in Melbourne. Not at all. Everything
wants overhauling. To begin with, the
Sydney reporters in the Commonwealth Par-
liament will need entirely reformed arrangements
for getting out copy and sending it away.
The Electric Telegraph Department sends up two
or three little boys in red as messengers. A
Sydney reporter happened to go out after he had
given telegraphic copy for despatch, and when he
returned he found the urchin still there. He
hadn’t even started, and the whole Department is
just like that small boy.
The “Light-Load Bill” now before the British
House of Lords provides—
That every sea-going- vessel other than those of under
80 tons reg. employed in the coasting trade, yachts and
fishing-boats, shall before Jan. 1, 1902, carry on their
sides, in such a position, which shall be left to the Board
of Trade’s officials to determine, a mark similar to the
maximum-load-line mark. When proceeding to sea in
ballast or partially loaded, this new load-line must be im-
mersed, or at least at the water’s edge, otherwise the
vessel is to he liable to detention, and the person respon-
sible to similar penalties as for overloading.
This much-needed measure should go far towards
preventing the practice of sending vessels
(especially steamers) to sea insufficiently ballasted
—the latter sometimes having only half of the
propeller-boss immersed. It will doubtless re-
ceive the strong support of Lloyd’s, who have
been so badly bitten during the last few years
over broken tail-shafts and dropped propellers,
that the period of tail-shaft inspection has been
reduced from two years to one. Compliance with
this rule ought certainly to be added to their
other requirements by Australian Marine Boards,
as the practice it is aimed at is very prevalent‘on
this side of the world.
“ N.” : On every railway bridge under
which the Duke of York passed on his trip from
Melbourne to Brisbane there was a man with a
red flag ready. No one else was allowed on the
bridge when the train was going past. The
authorities had a vision of an anarchist on each
bridge with a keg of dynamite ready to drop
on the duke as he went by. Yet is there a
eal practical working anarchist in Australia ?

“Mignon,” as adapted from a more sombre
story in “ Wilhelm Meister,” is a rather patchy
tale of not much motive, but as in opera the music
is always supposed to wipe its feet on the words
this is a matter of small importance. Briefly, as
embodied by Musgrove’s company, at Sydney
Royal, it is the story of a stoutish, phlegmatic
young student who buys from her master a bare-
legged girl of no importance. She earns her
living by doing an occasional egg dance—the
dance in question is not given, though the eggs
are placed tantalisingly before the audience. If
Wilhelm had been a Frenchman this transaction
would have resulted in immediate Romance, but
being a German, he merely tells Mignon to warm
her hands by the fire, and endeavors, as far as can
be ascertained from his grand-opera fashion of
saying everything in scales, to inspire her with
the desire to be something useful. Later, his
orderly soul being upset by her habit of annex-
ing his other best girl’s dresses, he advises
her to take courage and depart. He does not
seemingly ask her to take anything else in
the way of coin or luggage, but he refrains from
doing so in such a beautiful voice that no one
notices the omission at the time. An act
further on, Mignon's as yet undiscovered father
fires a castle for no adequate reason, while the
people to whom the castle seems to belong stand
outside and sing a cheerful chorus, giving a strong
impression that the insurance money is a matter
of some importance, and that they have a good,
large policy in a solid office. Later on, Wilhelm,
Mignon, and the harping old father meet casually
in another castle, when, happening to hear Mig-
non murmur his name in her sleep, it occurs to
that excessively steady young man that she may
possibly be rather fond of him. He then signifies
that he has no objection, after which Mignon fills
in time by fainting for a few minutes. She is
revived by three bars of music, and the curtain
falls with the three singing songs together, it
being understood that Mignon and Wilhelm are
to be married, though nothing very definite is
said on the subject.
* * * *
Madame Slapoffski, who takes the part of the girl
who comes to fortune through refusing to earn her
living, has an exquisite voice of light and shade,
but she requires face exercise, so that she may
learn to control her features when she kneels with
her mother’s prayer-book in Ijer hands, or dis-
covers her long-lost father by means that would
not establish her claim in a court of law. The
impression left in this writer’s mind was that
clever Madame Slap, has a sense of the ridiculous,
which is bad in grand opera. Miss Lilian
Coomber, as Felina, occasionally helps the
prompter to earn his bread. Her voice hardly
manages the staccato notes in “Titania.” Salvi
is nonchalant as the young man who makes love
to one girl in front of another; he sings in perfect
tune but without much enthusiasm, and when we
read in the programme that he is a young student
in search of adventure, it seems incongruous that
he should look so much more like a young man
who wants to be left in peace. If he was described
as being in search of a second-hand chest of
drawers or a durable kitchen-chair, the situation
would be more understandable. He looks like a
man in pursuit of a useful substance that is going
cheap.

There’s a whisper that “Florodora” has
nearly run its course at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), and
that the “ Casino Girl ” is hovering about some-
where behind the wings ready to float on the first
opportunity. Still, so many changes have been
made in “Florodora” itself that it is almost a
new opera again, and with a few more changes it
might start its career anew, and do the whole
business over again.

In “ The Night Birds of London,” due to
flutter round Sydney Lyceum some time longer,
the first act, with its gauzy ballet, is unquestion-
ably the best, and next to it comes the final up-
roar when the public anxiety over the Missing In-
fant and the Lost Will is relieved by a bright and
deserving gas explosion. At the same time the
conduct of the heroine in following her husband
into the dubious drawing-room of the Night Birds
Club is certainly peculiar; whilst still more un-
feminine is her action in leaving him there, with
the remark that she intends to go home and pray
for him. The wife who prays for her husband in-
stead of protecting him would be the first to feel
annoyed if he did the same by her in time of
temptation. For the rest, the drama plods along
the old weary road of the vitriol-throwing wife
and the inconvenient husband, and continues to be
not nearly so wicked as its name infers.
*# # *
“The French Spy” continues to find
out nothing of any real value at Sydney
Criterion, where Russia is depicted as a place in
which no one dares to make the most ordinary
observation without looking out of the door, in
case an emissary of the Czar should be about.
The evolutions of the Mysterious Document need
careful study during the first act, its peregrina-
tions being varied, though, later, it is permitted
to die out of the play altogether, having done its
fetal work of getting everyone into trouble,
ihereis a fine, but exaggerated, touch about the
woman who wants to wear her best things before
her rival, when the latter is being led out to
execution. The fact that the rival is blind, how-
ever enjoyable in itself, is, under the circum-
stances, distinctly regrettable.

The gigantic and utterly selfish stranger
who came all the way from Mars to teach Horace
Parker the gospel of Otherdom is back again at
Sydney Palace, not from any love of Horace
but m order to work out his own sen-
tence, and _ get back home again. As the
equally selfish, earthly person who was con-
verted, Herbert Ross is absolutely natural, and,
therefore, good. Presumably a messenger who
had been heaved out from Mars to Earth would
act somewhat strangely, and that assumption, no
doubt, explains the dolorous voice of Stephenson,
lhis writer doesn’t know any Martians, and, there-
fore, cannot say if the long, grey individual is
natural or pot, but, viewed from a worldly stand-
point, he is decidedly forceful, and that covers a
multitude of eccentricities. Roxy Barton does
the worldly Mrs. Clarence to perfection, and Aunt
Martha struck this warm-hearted scribe as the
prettiest woman he ever saw—on the stage.
* * * *
The Duke and Duchess arrive in Melbourne
nightly per animated picture at Sydney Cen-
tenary Hall, afterwards proceshing per medium
of the same instrument. The Duke, as in real
lif®, gives the impression of a small nervous man
with a strong tendency to become invisible. We
see him alighting from the gangway, after which
he seems to get lost, and a large crowd of great
people move about with their backs to the
audience looking on the ground for something.
For a considerable time he continues lost,
generally seeming to be stowed away behind the
big drum, or the Duchess’s hat, or some
similar erection. The man who explained
things occasionally advised the audience to note
the enthusiastic crowds, but all the crowds this
scribe could see appeared to take the whole affair
in a haughty spirit. Some curious effects are
given by these animated pictures. The Melbourne
illuminations are a dazzling show, and the ten-
dency of the instrument to make what is dark
darker and what is light lighter is weird and
ghostlike. For instance, when the Highlanders
are marching in a long even row their gleaming
white socks stand out conspicuously and appear
to be going entirely on their own, the balance of
the brawny Scots being merged in the general
murkiness of the street.
* * * *
At Sydney Empire, Fisko, the Boy Juggler,
spins plates in the air, sometimes to the final de-
struction of one of them, but when he is a little
older and has quite overcome his stage fright, he
will probably make himself complete master of
those tricky pieces of china. A song on the Boys
of Australia is well rendered by one of the com-
pany, but the audience is thinking of the Dooko-
york, and while their eyes are on the stage their
thoughts are with the fleshpots of Government
House. It is difficult to fix the attention of an
audience these times.
* * * *
The Imperial Concert season at Sydney Cen-
tennial opened well. The callow-looking Raimund
Pechotsch and his handsome dad have got a strong
grip of the Muse, and make her express her feel-
ings through their violins. There are thirteen
items on the programme, but the multitude of
encores runs it to nearly three times that length,
and as long as big Avon Saxon and Mdlle. Vir-
ginia Cheron respond with items like “ Down the
Swanee River ” and “ Cornin’ thro’ the Rye,” the
encores will come thick and fast. Yet this is a
land where the aged papa is merely the old bloke,
and where the rye is infested with snakes, and
to smile at a girl therein means an action
for breach of promise in the near future.
As for Madame Belle Cole, the tremendous
demonstration that greeted her appearance
after over seven years’ absence showed how well
she was remembered.

One of the most meritorious of the flood
of little shows which has poured in on Sydney in
the day of its ducal affliction is the dialect and
character entertainment at the Y.M.C.A. Hall,
where the versatile Mr. Parkyn recites “Banjo’s”
poems, sketches a Cornish farmer rousing his
youngsters up at an early hour, and recites in
English, Scotch, Welsh, Irish, and Cornish.
Between whiles, accompanist Bromley lifts up a
serviceable tenor voice in a manner which gener-
ally moves the limited audience to an encore. But
the one-man show has fallen on evil days, and
dropped by the wayside generally.
* * * *
Wirfch’s Circus commenced its latest Syd-
ney campaign on the old battling ground opposite
Redfern railway station, Thursday last, and
although the interfering authorities had
ukased that members of the show should not
go into the tiger’s cage to be damaged by
the raging contents thereof, The game o! French
tigue, the players of which, being mounted, try
to grab a rosette on the other fellow’s right
shoulder from the left hand side, is the sort of
thing that should become intensely popular in
the back-blox if the Australian is only half as
horsey as he is cracked up to be. For the rest,
the lady who juggles on horse-back with knives,
firebrands, and other things, reels and whirls
on her giddy way, and the tiny ponies fight to a
finish, smiting each other with great dexterity
on the chest and point, but finding it difficult to
reach the solar-plexus— the corn-sack. At leaps
and handsprings and general ability to cast them-
selves through the air over several horses and an
elephant, Mr. Salvini and his merry men do won-
ders. It makes one tired to think of all the brain-
toil that must have been expended on all those
brutes to make them appear as intelligent as the
ordinary man, and much more so than some men
one sees dodging the tram-cars in George-street.
This last refers to the performing animals, and
not to Mr. Salvini’s men.

At Sydney Tivoli, Arthur Crane’s “ I
Trust You Still” floats over the jasper river that
shimmers through the city of haze, and, altogether,
Crane is the soulful element of the Tivoli just
now. Tod Callaway’s dreary song about some-
thing being b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-1 may pass without fur-
ther comment. Austin Rudd is as refreshing as a
whisky-and-soda after a cold-tea party. The
newest feature is the American Bioscope, by
which the audience is taken for a ride over the
Lake railway, Hong-kong—a line with some re-
markably steep grades and rather pleasant
scenery. There are also views of London, from
which one gathers that King Edward’s metropolis
consists mostly of ’busses carrying ads. for Li pton’s
teas. Swarms of people and vast piles of
buildings fill in the background, but the ’busses
and their flaring ads. are aggressive. The very
best animated picture is the cat’s head which the
little boy saw through the magnifying glass; but
the one that pleases the audience most is that of
the mystic wrestlers who tear each other to pieces
and put the fragments together again by a process
of resurrection made easy.

“Turned-up,” played by the Sydney
Comedy Club at the Queen’s Hall, one night last
week, relates to the vicissitudes of a certain
married couple who have both married again—the
wife because she considers her sailor husband
safely disposed of in the deep, deep sea, and the
husband from pure cussedness. Consequently,
when he returns to rebuke his missus for bigamy,
he is rebuked by his new black wife, who follows
him. Therefore a dark cloud of suspicion rests on
him, as does the box-lid on his first wife’s second
husband—a son having decided that the best way
out of the difficulty is to conceal him in that
piece of furniture. Whenever a wrong husband
or brother turns up on the stage, the other
characters invariably think the best thing to do is
to hide him in a box, though a moment’s thought
would convince them that he can’t remain there
permanently, and the trouble will be just as bad
when he comes out. The returned husband’s
second wife is alleged to be a Kaffir, but she is
dressed like an American negress and yabbers
Australese. The first wife’s taste has also gone
to black of another type, her second husband
being Carraway Bones, undertaker. Peace is
restored by the two accidental spouses, so to
speak, marrying each other, and the grown-up son
and daughter marrying other people without
further worry as to the number of their parents.
It is the sort of play that ought to go fast and
furiously, and therefore it is the play which an
amateur company, which is generally slow and
peaceful, always insists on playing.
Miss OLIVE KINGSTON , a Melbourne Songbird.
Jacotin, Photo., Paris .
Herewith The Bulletin publishes the
photo., taken in Paris last year, of a sweet young
Melbourne songstress. Some few months have
elapsed since Miss Olive Kingston returned from
the Gay Capital, where she studied awhile at
L’Ecole Marchesi, in company with Regina Nagel
and Amy Castles. The Marchesi system proved
very successful in her case. A high mezzo-
soprano, with a pure, flexible voice, she had been
accepted as a comparative artist among amateurs
ere she went to Europe, and a year’s tuition from
Madame served to bring out her charming voice

The strange, family-vault drama wherein
Dampier restored himself to Melbourne notice at
the Bijou has passed away like a dream, and
“ Black Flag” waves in its stead. The banner of
gloom is casually alluded to as a bit of bunting
which flies from the masthead at Portland prison
every time a convict gets out upon the loose. It
doesn’t flutter within view of the audience, but in-
asmuch as two felons go forth from durance vile
and join a picnic party in a cave hard by there
can be no doubt that the Flag pops up somewhere
during the proceedings. One of the illicit pic-
nickers is an innocent Dampier, sentenced to a
long term of captivity for hitting a long-winded
capitalist on the head. The blow was really dealt
by Dampier’s half-brother, and the other convict,
who wears a false nose, is aware of this fact.
Likewise, a fresh, ingenious youth pervades the
drama, protesting all the while that Dampier was
wrongfully sentenced. After he has been shot by
a brutal interloper the youth returns to life and
brings the bad half-brother in sorrow to the
Criminal Court. Meanwhile, Miss Lily Dampier
has repented of her foolishness in giving evidence
against the good man of her heart. She helps to
repair her error by rowing one convict to the pic-
nic in her little boat, and saving the other from a
watery swim, but on Saturday night something
went wrong with these exploits, and the curtain
fell inopportunely.
* • • *
“The Black Flag ” is a dull, unintellectual
entertainment, and Dampier makes a mistake in
staging it. As the innocent Bill, of Portland, he
is required to fight a series of encounters with four
warders, who fall down when he deals them
a gentle push. Dampier doesn’t shine
in such struggles, neither does he escape
with alacrity when the four men have in-
tentionally lost their balance. Master Fred
Dampier, as the youth with the long-lost evidence,
is a bright, promising novice, and John Forde,
the comic convict, provokes a few kindly smiles.
But the humor of Forde pale 3 into -significance
whilst the ocean tide comes creeping in creakily
upon the sandy margin of the picnic. The ripples
make their approacli in the manner of a window-
blind, and retire up-hill in jerks. No previous
ocean has ever seemed so much in need of oil upon
the troubled apparatus.

Dampier produces his thoughtful and in-
teresting Shylock of Venice on Friday evening,
and if he is well advised he will keep Shakespeare
going for longer than one consecutive night. The
chances are that the immortal Israelite who
sharpens his knife on his boot would be an accept-
able item for at least a week.

At Her Majesty’s (Melb.), the strictly un-
true story of Napoleon and his Josephine will be
heard no more after this (Thursday) evening. On
Friday night the theatre is to be closed for a final
burial of the men who, for all public purposes, died
at Waterloo, and on Saturday the first performance
of J. C. W’s Italian Opera co. falls due. Great
things are expected of the musical organisation
from Italy. The principals are said to be worthy of
the 48 Australian voices engaged for the chorus, and
the 41 instrumentalists for conductor Hazon
beats the air. Also, the scenery and fixings have
a private reputation of the highest Williamsonian
character. If other things prove to be all that
rumor promises, the price-list will get general
approval, for it goes no higher than six shillings,
with a minimum of two “bob.” Moreover, the
seats at 6s. and 4s. can be purchased for a shilling
less in lots of 40, and this concession to the class
of people who love to consign themselves to the
theatre in wholesale quantities is already showing
good results. The season opens with Verdi’s
“Aida.”

The marble stairs of Rickards’ new Opera
House are sustaining the heavy tread of innumer-
able Melbourne feet these times, and the popular
opinion re Marie Lloyd, and the animated first-
part, and other features of the bill is quite favor-

in her songs, but not too sultry. Her coster gal
has a genuine appearance, and her salt-sea bath-
ing song earns many larfs for the droll little party.

“ Women and Wine ” looks good enough
for another week or two at Melbourne Royal,
although none of the characters look good, with
the exception of Miss Frances Ross and the mild
old blind father who walks around Paris with an
outstretched hand turned downwards. The aver-
age blind gentleman in the street puts his hand
the other side up to catch the sunbeams and aught
else that may greet his palm, but Walter Baker’s
stage parent is a cultured person, depending for
means of subsistence on the flower-trade of a
prettily-gowned angel in a flopsome hat. Nobody
can fathom the commercial mystery of Miss
Ross’s life. She buys half-a-dozen penny bunches
of flowers in the early morning, and offers them
all day long to a non-purchasing public. When a
lurid demi-mondaine proposes to “tip” the wan-
derer handsomely, she rejects the piece of gold
because it burns her, she says. And yet she can
afford to keep herself and the old man clean and
beautiful every evening until further notice.

At tie Town Hall the Dolores (Trebelli)
song recitals are presumably off for the present,
seeing that Gerardy, the ’cellist, is about to have
the loan of the vast municipal apartment. Mdlle.
Dolores has warbled French songs, old and new
English ballads, and Italian operatic airs, and her
work has been such a sweet artistic success from
first to last that Melbourne will not be happy
till it hears her again. A brilliant soprano singer,
whose personality is as charming as her voice, the
placid Dolores seems fairly entitled to be called
Great. In fact, the present scribe considers her
Greater than the Duchess.
To-night (Thursday) is to find Jean
Gerardy, the famous violincellist, appealing to the
alleged musical taste of Melbourne at the Town
Hall. This very sudden and unexpected stranger
will have the support of Edward Scharff at the
piano, and a new vocalist —Miss Olive Kingston—
will make her first appearance on the concert
platform.

Bill Blinker and Natty Ninkum, or similar

Celestial orchestra. They go on for hours at a

From the letter of a M.L. officer in
S’Africa; —
History tells us of nations that have fought for inde-
pendence. Probably never has a people fought with so
much tenacity as the Boer. He knows the value of the
country that is slowly being taken from him, and is
fighting with the courage of despair. . . . The Boer
—the average Boer —is not as black as he is painted.
About a month ago, when we had just taken the position
we occupy, four of the I.L.H. were captured. The Boers
took them to their laager, gave them a good meal and a
tot of rum (probably out of the convoy captured from
Clements), and sent them back to us.
“ Smiler ” Hales is going in for fiction

Some of it is a little rich for the diet of a family

It was the passion which belongs of right (the right of
Nature) to the wife, not the passion of the wanton. Such
a woman could snatch her husband’s rifle from the wall
and defend her honor, saving the last cartridge for her-
self, but she could never yield to any man’s blandish-
ments, no matter how strong the current of her blood
might run ; and, believe me, there are many such women
on God’s green earth, more women than men, my masters.

Thank heaven, one returned contingenter
has got his reward, anyhow. Witness this, from
Melbourne Argus, May 18 :
Tatura, Friday.—Private James Lockwood, who left
here with the second Victorian contingent for South
Africa about 17 months ago, was accorded a most en-
thusiastic welcome by the townspeople on his return
home last night. Although the train did not arrive until
nearly 11 o’clock, he was met at the railway station by a
number of riflemen, the fire brigade, and a combined band
from Murchison and Tatura, as well as hundreds of towns-
people. As the train entered the station the band played
“ See the Conquering Hero Comes,” and cheers were
given. He was on arrival carried to a chariot, which was
in waiting. A torchlight procession was then formed
(the chariot being drawn by several young men), and pro-
ceeded to the Mechanics’ Institute. On the way volleys
were fired and fireworks displayed. On arrival at the
Mechanics’ Institute, after the audience had sung “ Home,
Sweet Home,” addresses of welcome and congratulations
were delivered by the Rev. A. Chambers, Messrs. Bazeley
and Calder. Private Lockwood suitably responded.
Several patriotic songs and selections by the band were
given during the evening.
They must have mistaken him for Wellington
returning after Waterloo.

if you question a complacent Lin Fat, or Wung

pitying manner that Marshall Hall adopts

these works of the great Chow masters. A Euro-
pean, in his denseness, concludes that the artist
who hits the tom-tom with a stick is merely
under contract to make one kind of noise mechani-
cally, regardless of consequences, until the
conductor bids him cease. But probably a bang
on the abdomen of a heathen drum, at one par-
ticular point of the tumult, means half a page of
descriptive hysteria such as Prof. Hall publishes
on his Wagnerian programmes. It is, percha,nce,
the cry of an agonised soul in a paroxysm of re-
morse. Or it signifies the first streak of day-
dawn, followed by a drowsy awakening of Nature
in a sullen mood. We don’t know what it means.

The 10 per cent, dividend of the Bank of New. South
Wales appears to have become a permanent institution
again. Profits are equal to £6 2s. 3d. per cent, per annum
on the shareholders’ funds. The B.N.S.W. has now
£21,590,076 of deposits ; nearly a million of note circula-
tion, and it has the stupendous cash reserve of £5,891,673;
while cash and liquid assets together amount to over
£8,000,000. It easily keeps its place as the boss bank of
Australasia, and it also ranks very high among the banks
of the world. Among about 150 banks enumerated by
Whitaker’s Almanac as doing business in London, only
12 have larger reserves, and even such national institu-
tions as the Bank of Ireland and Bank of Scotland can’t
approach it in this respect. Australia may have a good
many doubtful institutions, political, financial, and per-
sonal, but its B.N.S.W. seems able to fairly claim that it
is beyond suspicion.

The profits are equal to £7 6s. Bd. per cent, per annum
on the shareholders’ funds as they were at the beginning
of the half-year (capital, £lOO,OOO ; reserves, £221,368 =
£321,368). The Westralian Bank pegs away at building
up its reserves with a persistence which can’t be too much
commended, and it pays the largest banking dividend in
Australasia. At the same time, Westralia isn’t what it
was, and the profits of Westralia’s one big bank aren’t
what they were either; and though the reserves continue
to accumulate, they do it with less than the old velocity.
During the half-year just finished the business
of the Westralian Bank has shown steady progress. De-
posits are now £1,735,005, an increase of £111,569. Of
these no less than £1,006,302 are current accounts, bear-
ing no interest. The cash reserves are enormous—specie
and bullion, £1,013,051 ; and State securities, £47,400 ;
total, £l,o6o,4sl— equal to 55 per cent, on all liabilities to
the public. This seems a needlessly large reserve, and
why the Westralian Bank doesn’t invest at least another
£200,000 in interest-bearing State securities (not neces-
sarily Westralian securities) it is difficult to understand.
Even allowing for the fact that the bank’s gold-buying
business requires a great deal of coin always available,
the cash reserve looks large enough to be a serious waste
of money.

The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Co.

an allegedly insufficient figure—shows these results for
the past three years : Total

The profits for the last three years have been at the aver-
age rate of £8 os. 6d. per cent, per annum, which seems
reasonably good, all things considered. Out of the last
10 years there were five in which the dividend was 5 per
cent., and five in which it reached 6 per cent.
* * * *
The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Co. is
commonly held up, by reason of its undoubted success,
as a brilliant example of the blessings and advantages of
private, as compared with State, railway ownership.
Certainly the Maoriland State railways don’t earn £8 os.
fid. percent., and if the Wellington and Manawatu Co.
did this by its own efforts, and without charging any
more than Government rates, it ivould be a shining ex-
ample. But the co., like most of its kind, owes a great
deal of its success to State aid. The shareholders put up
£170,900 capital. The State aided them with land,
valued in the co.’s balance-sheet at £96,570, and by mak-
ing them a present of a bit of unfinished line valued
(also in the co.’s balance-sheet) at £51,838. This means
that the shareholders put up only £170,000 and received
State aid to the extent of 1148,408. The rest of the
money (£680,000) was borrowed on debentures at 5 per
cent and the co. was able to raise the money partly by-
reason of having all this large State grant to give as
eeurity. Altogether the co.’s complaints about the
treatment it has received from the State re taxation, &c.,
don’t appear to rest on any very massive foundation. In
fact, it appears to have made a much better bargain with
the public than the public did with it.
The Northern Steamship Co. (Auckland, Maori-
land) shows a profit of £5094 for the year ended 31st
March, 1901. A dividend at the rate of 7 per cent, per
annum absorbs £4567, leaving £527 to be added to the
reserves, subject to any deductions which might be made
at the annual meeting by way of fees voted to the direc-
tors. (It appears that the directors of the Northern
S.S. 00. receive no fixed remuneration, but are dependent
on the good feeling of the annual meeting.) Paid-up
capital is £69,642, and reserves are £40,638 (insurance
fund, £32,554 ; reserve for boilers and repairs, £6647; and
undivided profit, £1437).

The half-year just finished is the best up to date, and now
that the very humble reserves are beginning to grow a
little and bring in an income, the improvement should
continue. Altogether too much of the Association’s cash,
however (£5845 out of £11,611 of shareholders’ total
funds'!, is invested in mortgages. The influx of borrowed
money gives property an inflated value in this country,
and lending on mortgage is very apt to be lending on
inflated values.

Ballarat Woollen and Worsted Co. (Ballarat,
Victoria) shows a profit of £2lBl for the half-year to 31st

reserves amounting to £17,469 —a very solid figure for a
small concern with a total paid-up capital of £29,924.
At the same time, the policy of paying away more than
the earnings in order to keep up the very large dividend
of 15 per cent, is wholly objectionable.

The Tasmanian Loan, Guarantee and Finance Co. has a
paid-up capital of £15,000. Its reserves consist of depre-
ciation fund, £2600, and undivided profit, £79. Its chief
investments are £19,965, lent on mortgage. If the de-
preciation fund is really wanted for depreciation pur-
poses, to cover losses, or probable losses, on these
mortgages (and as the co. suspended payment of divi-
dends for a considerable time to build up this fund, it may
be reasonably inferred that it was urgently wanted to
cover actual or very probable losses) then the only real
reserve is the £79 above mentioned. Under all the cir-
cumstances the policy of increasing the dividend to £l9
more than the earnings looks very unwise. The earnings
for the half-year are only equal to £4 4s. 9d. per cent, per
annum on the shareholders’ capital and total reserves. If
the mortgages are all perfectly sound, and paying full
interest, and there is no depreciation to write off, the
return seems very low.
* m • *
A plain, true tale. A certain building society had
large overdraft. The bank called on it to pay up. The
society, then in extremis, offered a mortgage on its city
premises, not worth nearly the amount of the overdraft.
Bank refused with scorn. A director and large share-
holder of the bank was also director of a certain finance
co. He recommended his co. to invest the amount re-
quired to clear the bank overdraft, in the
proposed mortgage. This was done. The money
so applied was almost the entire fortune
of an orphan girl, which had been placed with
the finance co. for safe investment. The bank got its
money—which was good for the aforementioned director,
he being a large shareholder. The director also got the
usual commission on the investment. The finance co.
lost nothing. The building society broke, however, and
the girl has a great hulking block of offices which yields
her about lj- per cent, on her money.

Out of this large writing down £7500 is described as
having been “ placed to a contingency account as a pro-
vision for bad and doubtful debts, the appropriation of
such amount, or portion of it, to be dealt with at a
future date,” but as the £7500 wholly disappears
out of the balance - sheet it is written off so far
as that document is concerned. The total debts,
before this amount was written off, were only £56,373,
and it is difficult to suppose that so large a proportion of
them could have gone bad, or partially bad, all in one act,
and quite unexpectedly. And if the loss didn’t come
unexpectedly—if it has been foreseen for any considerable
time—then some of the 10 per cent, dividends were
wholly unjustifiable. When the big drop in the profits
arrived, in 1894, the dividend should have been corres-
pondingly reduced. The management did not face this
necessity, and the consequence is a great disappearance
among the reserves.

After a long silence, Victoria again hears the
persuasive voice of the Mount Deddick gentleman. What
that gentleman (his name is Sheddon) is really after
passes all reasonable comprehension, unless he simply
wants a concession to sell at a profit to the confiding
British investor, and thinks that almost any kind of a
concession will do. Mount Deddick is a casual kind of
mountain in Gippsland, up towards the N.S.W. border.
It lies on the borders of two large counties with a joint
population of about 5000. The Deddick region has been
harried for years by prospectors, who have decided very
unanimously that it is a poor field. Mr. Sheddon, so
far as is known, has found nothing there that seems even
remotely payable; reports describe Deddick as looking
just as bad as ever it did. Yet Sheddon has, for about
two years, assured the Victorian Government that he
is prepared to float a company in England which will
open up the great mineral wealth of the region, and also
build a railway from the coast to Deddick—a line through
90 miles of barren mountains where there can be no pas-
senger traffic worth speaking of, and where there is
practically no agricultural produce to carry. The line is
simply to fetch down to the coast the inexhaustible
riches of Deddick —which no Victorian mining authority
can find to have any riches worth removal. Sheddon
wanted a grant of a strip of land for his railway to stand
on, and the astonished Victorian Government proposed
that his co. should deposit £lO,OOO as proof that it really
meant to build a railway, so that it could lay the matter
before Parliament without being suspected of playing a
ridiculous hoax on that august body. Sheddon pro-
mised that the deposit should be forthcoming, and after
a dead silence of nine months he promises it again, by
cable from England this time. The deposit doesn’t
materialise, but the cable is satisfactory as showing that
a very hopeful and interesting person isn’t dead yet. To
all appearance Sheddon is either a very hilarious joke,
or else he is a person who wants to get a concession
for building a railway to somewhere, even if it is only a
useless and uninhabited mountain, with a view to selling
his rights to someone else. There is no reason to believe
that the right of building a railway to Deddick is
worth any more than the right to carry all the rocks
on the east coast of Australia over to the west coast of
Australia. If it was built it would hardly do Victoria any
good. A company could hardly be floated to build it
unless some most unjustifiable things were said in the
prospectus about the awful Deddick country. If the
Victorian Government contradicted these necessary state-
ments it would wreck the Deddick enterprise ; and if it
didn’t contradict them it would be accused afterwards of
helping, for a sinister purpose, to ruin British widows and
orphans by letting them put their money into the Deddick
“cat.” Altogether, Victoria had better decide to have
nothing to do with Sheddon.

At the South Mine, at Broken Hill, on Friday,
24th May, a sudden and totally unpremonstrated fall of
earth entombed six men. A relief party immediately set
to work, and two of the bodies were soon recovered ; but
subsequent falls of stuff rendered operations so danger-
ous and tedious that all the corpses were not unearthed—
after ceaseless labour in four-hour shifts —until Sunday
morning. All the unfortunates were crushed almost out
of recognition. Four of them were married, and leave
behind them, in all, 16 children. Truly Broken Hill is a
great grim factory for making of widows —grass and
otherwise, and the need for a compulsory and universal
life insurance system for all workers is very great.
* * ♦ *
B.H. Junction has got its six months’ suspen-
sion of labor conditions ; and the local Municipal Council
held a special meeting (only Laborites attending) to
denounce it. But as the co. was going oyer £4OO to the
bad every week, and hadn’t even paid a div. with lead at
£l7 10s. (it is now £l2 ss. or so), it isn’t easy to see what
else the Minister could do. The last div. the co. paid
was in the first months of ’97 ; since then it has paid a
quarter of a million in wages, so that Broken Hill town
has done better than the shareholders by a long chalk.
• * * *
The immediate future of the British B.H. has
been hanging in the scales the last fortnight or so. The
“colonial” directors, it is said, wanted to shut up the
mill and do only much-needed prospecting ; the London
Board favored going on, exercising economies wherever
possible. Among which economies a further cut in
wages is feared. But the other co.’s won’t move without
the lead of the B.H. Prop. ; and the big co. isn’t feeling
the pinch like some.
* * • •
Block 14’s half-yearly report, to March 31, is as
exasperatingly short of detail as usual. It sticks out,
however, that, in Order to pay the two divs., amounting
to £lO,OOO, it was necessary to reduce the surplus of
liquid assets by £8783. The brutal fact, therefore, is that
the profit only reached £1217. And that was with silver
at about present price and lead (of which the co. won
between 4000 and 5000 tons from its own mine) worth over
£2 10s. more than it is at present. Still, that doesn’t
mean that the co. is going back now at the rate of £12,000
or £15,000 a half-year. The directors explain : “ Your
directors have persistently pursued the policy of bringing
the large bodies of low-grade ore which exist in the mine
within the scope of treatment; but the present lovv prices
of lead, zinc, and silver have obliged them to curtail their
efforts in this direction, and to work on a smaller scale
with richer ore, thus reducing the output of crude ore by
about one-half.”
• * # *
The turn-out of several hundred men from the
Broken Hill mines would lead to the co-operative work-
ing of a good many little outside silver and copper shows,
if there were a smelter handy. It is proposed, therefore,
to try and get the State to set up a plant, which would
be useful, too, in connection with the fine technical college
now being built at Broken Hill.

“ Poor Duchess : ” Consider these daily-
paper reports :
At Port Melbourne: “ The Mayoress . . . gracefully
handed the bouquet trophy to the Princess, who smiled,
smelt the flowers, and thanked Mrs. Edwards.”
At Seymour: “Two little mites presented a basket of
beautiful roses. . . . The Duchess, who graciously ac-
cepted the gift,” ...
At Euroa : “ A little girl presented a magnificent bou-
quet of flowers.”
At Benalla : “ A little child was lifted up and handed
in a bouquet of York roses and violets.”
At Aliiury : “ Her It >yal Highness was presented with
a, oouquet and basket of flowers, and expressed gratifica-
tion at receiving the gifts.”
There is a chronic legend that all royal ladies are
passionately fond of flowers. Yet they must
heave the bouquets out of the window after the
train starts, else they would be smothered under
the accumulation.

Those two weary old shrubs which the
two .looks planted at Ballarat long ago keep
infesting the sorrowful page of this country’s
literature. The latest :
At Ballarat East His I loyal Highness was presented
with a casket of gold specimens by Isaiah Pearce, Mayor,
and his brother, the largest specimen weighing lljoz.
The Duke and Duchess visited the Town Hall gardens,
and inspected with evident interest the fir-trees planted
by the Prince and his elder brother, the late Duke of
Clarence, in 1881. The trees are both growing well, but
the latter tree requires a great deal of attention, for
when the Prince who planted it died it seemed to lose its
former vigor. The Duke and Duchess each planted
another tree.

would go in the night and bound on these two
; e.v trees it would probably save Australia a lot

The flimsy triumphal arch erected by two
municipal councils at St. Kilda(Melb.) Junction—
the arch which caught the eye of the Jook on one
occasion only, and was an isolated example of
foolishness for the next fortnight—cost £BOO, it
seems. £BOO for an out-of-the-way structure, lined
with flannelette or something which broke away
from the wooden framework at the first gust of
wind, and hung in rags from the roof. One of the
contributing councils held a discussion before
passing its share of the bill for this tattered grovel,
but the other council had the grace to say as little
as possible about the matter. Why infuriate your
ratepayers by reminding them of a wild exnendi-
ture upon the welcoming of that weary Joolf ’

, T ]l e syndicate that'ran the erand-stand at
the Melbourne Anglican Cathedral in connection
with the recent drunkery left the place in a
hideous, sordid mess. After the timber work of
the stand was removed, it was found that the
ground around the sacred edifice was littered
deep with lunch-papers, beer bottles, broken fruit
orange-peels, and rags. The beautiful lawns that
at one time surrounded the Cathedral had disap-
peared, having been trampled into the earth by
the workmen and attendants, and it will cost the
Cathedral authorities most of the price they got
fiom the syndicate to put the place in order again.

According to the Age reporter, who
travelled by the “ York ” train from Melbourne
to Brisbane, there was no doubt that G-od Almighty
made a bit of a demonstration in the Jook’s honor.
As the train rushed past Wodonga platform,
“the sun was setting grandly in the west, with
gold broadening into red, and chastened by a
streak or two of regal purple. A haze had settled
down over the tree-clad hills. The Duke and
Duchess were departing with the sun.” And God
said-—“ Let there be no more light.”

After all, the Brisbane dirty chicken came
home to roost in due time on the bosoms of the
ratepayers. For a score of years they returned
aldermen who permitted good old private entev-
prise to attend to sanitary matters, and left their
undrained town a prey to Microbe and co. Now,
the Plague resides in Brisbane, and refuses to be
evicted ; the Admiral declines to bring his nice
clean ships to the dirty port; the Duke cuts his
visit short, and Brisbane is struck on its tenderest
grovel. The Brisbane Telegraph says franti-
cally that this is another of the dreadful results of
Federation. Its idea evidently is that Sydney
and Melbourne conspired to borrow the fleet to
Brisbane’s undoing, and that the Duke really
wanted to come and stay a long time with Bris-
bane’s Plague-germ, only he was frustrated by a
dark and unprincipled plot.

Detective Rochaix, the linguist, were put on to
guard York while in N.S.W. Rochaix has the
best detective nose for sly grog in the service ;
but, after all, it was neither a fighter, like Roche,
or grog-smeller, like Rochaix, who had much chance
to be of any real use in such a case. A man like
Lombroso, the mad doctor, a student of cranks, a
man with a genius for spotting abnormalities, is
wanted for work like that. Only a lunatic, in
some stage of lunacy, could see anything in
damaging Duke York, and the man who can

The experiment of getting a band of
alleged Australian stockmen—mainly collected
from the suburbs—to gambol before the Dukan-
duchess in Melbourne was certainly not inspired
by pleasant recollections of an experience of the
Duke of Edinburgh, in Colac, long ago. Genuine
stockmen were gathered in great numbers from
the Western-district runs to give H.R.H. a
rattling welcome, and the men dashed up to the
royal carriage as they might have charged a
break-away, cracking their whips and yelling
“Coo-ee!” with all their lung-power. Some of
them lost their heads, and said other things
besides “Coo-ee ! ” The display was well-meant,
but it missed the ’bus, for Edinburgh was
frightened almost out of his senses, and marked
his royal displeasure by passing through Colac
sitting as rigid as a brick chimney, and staring
blankly before him. Colac was disgusted, and
followed H.R.H. out of the town with observa-
tions which also were not “ Coo-ee !’’—observa-
tions of a kind that would turn the loyalists of
to-day green with horror.

Unhappy Duke ! Consider his Brisbane
experiences as set forth in the unvarnished daily-
paper tale
The gangway was promptly run out from the landing
stage. . . . The Mayor then presented an address, which
breathed, in the usual language, loyalty and devotion to
the King, and spoke in the highest terms of the Duke’s
former visit. ... At the south side of the river an
address was presented by the Mayor and aldermen Of
South Brisbane, and then the procession recrossed the
bridge and passed down the North Quay, where a line
was kept by school cadets. . . . Soon after arrival
at Government House His Royal Highness, attired in the
uniform of a rear-admiral, received addresses from 21
public bodies. . . .
That made 23 addresses, and the tired little man
had hardly got started.

The “Long-Haired Man” of Melbourne
—that being the common business sign and trade-
mark of Paul Perrier, palmist—struck trouble
recently. The worst trouble arose over an alleged
theft of 10s., but a minor difficulty related to a
question of 2s. 6d. One of the Long-Haired Man’s
lady clients alleged that after he had read her
future for the ordinary fee he held on affectionately
to her hand, and she had to pay him 2s. 6d. to let
go. The Bulletin here started to think so hard
over the inequality of things that it forgets how
the case ended. Just consider ! The world is
full of unappreciated women and spinsters and
ungathered blossoms—whose hands no men have
squeezed ; and here is a woman whose hand is in
such demand that she has to pay a man 2s. 6d. to
stop squeezing it.
There are some queer women round
Castlemaine (Vic.) way. A little while back a
young woman from those parts calmly labelled
herself a person of poor character by registering
the birth of a baby that never existed—in fact,
there never appeared to have been either infant
or father or “fall ” or anything. Lately, another
Castlemaine woman, who already had a three-
year-old youngster, went to Brighton and obtained
another small incubus, took it home, called in a
midwife, and went through all the outward
formalities attached to the birth of an infant
already 10 days old. This she passed off on her
husband as his own offspring and everything went
smoothly till the real mother called for her child—
when there were “explanations.” In the mean-
time the infant died—probably from being born
too frequently. The old man’s opinion of his
wife’s little caper has not, so far, transpired.

The police authorities protest too hard
that the extraordinary precautions taken in
searching the Ormuz were not prompted by dread
of an anarchist plot aiming at royalty. The
instructions apparently were: “Let no Italians
ashore ” ; anyhow, it was the Italian passengers
who were most particularly scrutinised. In fact,
they are still kept under the zealous eye of the
law. The action, it is said, was prompted by an
anonymous letter received by the police, who
appear to have run against a very dull hoax and
fallen in.
Thoughts engendered by a recent visit to
Melbourne:— »
As I wandered
Through the city
Thus I pondered :
“ What a pity
All this money should be squandered
On this semi-Royalty ;
And I wondered
Why the masses,
Thusly plundered
Stupid asses,
Have not und voce thundered
. Damn this so-called loyalty ! ”

For there would soon appear a neat

He told the news—said he :
“This book of mine will run, I think,
Into editions three.”
“ Good,” said the friend ; “ no doubt they’ll be—

Dear Bulletin.—'To paraphrase an old hjann, “The

line were only pretty middling. By order of the Railway
Commissioners, the universe held its breath while a train
conveying the heir to the British Crown stood for a brief
space'on the loop near Homebush. The very roosters
hushed their morning challenge .by request, officials
moved about with velvet feet, and a stalwart policeman
from Burwood urged a small nurse and a baby which had
strayed near the scene with a perambulator to keep dead
silence. One rank old billygoat was the only unawed
creature on God’s earth, and his remarks were quitr
unfit for publication and ultra-democratic. An enginr
which wheezed fearfully in the vicinity was ear
marked for future investigation, and the loco, superin-
tendent was observed to jot nasty remarks down in his
book about the engine-driver. A near approach enabled
the timorous visitor to discern that, while the Juke s
party slept, numbers of disguised detectives and press-
men kept watch, and bowed themselves in reverence when
the chorus of snores mounted up into the clear morning
air from the wonderful carriage which has cost the Stat/>
so much. Things will take some time to wilt down mt
their customary condition up Strathfield and Hornsl
way.— Norah.

For sex-disproportion in a fairly-compacb
settlement can this record of White Cliffs opal-
mining camp be beaten in N.S.W. —Males, 1068 ;
females, 474 ? For all-Australia, excluding the
mainly-pastoral outback of Queensland and S.A.,
Peak Hill goldfield (W.A.) probably holds the
record—sßß males to 83 of the other sort.
According to a paper read before the
Royal Society of Queensland by Sydney G-.
Martin, phthisis in that State kills annually
19 out of every 10,000 population, but, if
Polynesians be excluded, the rate sinks
to 10 per 10,000. One half of the Q.
Kanaka death-rate is due to tuber-
culosis, while the rest nearly all arises
from pneumonia and dysentery.
Queensland is afflicted, like the rest
of Australasia, with a falling birth-
rate. Its most portentous out-
look, however, is the rapid in-
crease of cancer—especially cancer
in the stomach. Bananaland
death-rate from this cause is
just double the rate in
England.
YORK OR NOTHING.
PABSY: “Look at my nice kitten, uncle. I’m

UNCLE : “ But why not Duke of York?”
PANSY: “ Oh, how can Ido that? I don't know
whether it's going to be a Duke or a
Duchess !”
Notwithstanding the efforts of N.S.W.
Govt, to give relatives ample chance to carry
away the family remains from Devonshire-
street cemetery, hosts complain of the Minister
responsible as a Hun and a Vandal. But the story
that the old cemetery is being trodden flat by the
pathetic feet of Japhet in search of a father has
little foundation. The general refusal of Japhet to
come for his father is the trouble, and what to do
with the discarded old man is the great difficulty.

“I am so glad that you

“ Yes, that's what I thought. Indeed, lam told

In spite of the howl of indignation' at the
time of the great scalding accident at Red fern
station, the bars on the suburban railway carriage
windows have never been removed. Most of the
long carriages on the Sydney suburban lines are
veritable death-traps, if anything goes wrong.
Another point: The long corridor cars on N.S.W.
lines have two doors each —one at either end of the
car. The Yic. corridor cars have about six doors
apiece. * * *
Be several late chloroform-deaths in
Maoriland, the Christchurch Press reprinted The

the whole, in favor of The Bulletin contributor’s
contention that chloroform’s day as an anaesthetic
is nearly over.

Those swashbucklers who went to South
Africa for the sake of the reception they were to
get on their return are meeting with bitter disap-
pointment. Hear the wail-ewm-boast of one of
them:
To the Editor op the Argos.
Sir,—We have been fighting in Africa for a year ; dur-
ing ten months we did not sit down at a table or sleep in
a bed. Our company can account for over a Boer per
man killed, besides wounded and prisoners. We were
continuously on outpost and scouting duty until
wounded or invalided. We arrived expecting at least a
welcome. Our comrades, who were unfortunately
obliged to come back months ago, without in many cases
having a chance to meet the enemy, we hear, received
some recognition. So far, we are strangers in a strange
land—no pay or welcome. The writer, with over £IOC
due to him, is, fortunately for himself and mates, a Jus-
tice of the Peace in his own colony, and has investments
in Melbourne, and considers it his duty to put his com-
rades’ case before the public, with 70 others invalided
home per s.s. Suevic.—Yours, &c., Trooper 207, Q.M.I.
As to the lack of cheers and beer and banners on
their return, a whole lot of these warriors de-
parted saying they were animated only by a stern
sense of duty. Not one of them said he was
animated by a hope of being kissed by many
strange girls on his return, or stipulated for a roar
of applause and free drink on landing. The arrears
of pay may be a real grievance, but the arrogant
demand for more public excitement is a demand
for something that wasn’t in the bond.

Owing to the pronouncedly different views
held by N.S.W. Judges as to the right of a police-
man to ask an accused questions without having
first cautioned him, Parliament should legislate
one way or the other. Judge Cohen, the other
day, so strongly animadverted on police evidence
acquired without the caution, that the accused,
for that and other reasons, was acquitted. On
the other hand, the Chief Justice accepts such
evidence without a murmur. The present practice
is perplexing to the police, perplexing to the
accused, and perplexing to the jury.

“ Orcus ” (a dentist) to The Bulletin
Re chloroform. I had a patient who insisted on having
her teeth extracted, although I strongly advised filling—
an operation too long for use of laughing-gas. An ex-
perienced medico whom I called in advised against
giving chloroform for a time, so I filled temporarily. But
the patient went to another dentist, and a medico ad-
ministered ether. The woman died four days after-
wards from acute pneumonia—in my opinion consequent
upon ether-administration.- The gist of the whole
matter : they die from chloroform at the time, but with
ether they die some days afterwards from pneumonia,
bronchitis, &c.

One of the saddest appeals that ever
struggled into print was that issued recently by a
West Maitland (N.S.W.) citizen signing himself
“Ironbark” “I.B.” wanted to know if the
Jook’s train could slow down a little as it passed,
through the town that sends o.x-merchant Brunker
to Parliament, and if arrangements could be made
for the ducal party to put its joint and several
head out of the window, and thereby get a large,
hot cinder in its eye, or strike its ear against a
tank, so that it couid be inspected by the loyal
inhabitants. (This made about the twentieth
appeal to the Jook to put his head out of the
window.) “ Ironbark ” finished his letter by say-
ing that, in the absence of the necessary arrange-
ments, and through the want of organisation and
public spirit, he feared West Maitland would have
to trust to chance for the “great honor” of the
Jook’s head being out of the window. As some
forgotten philosopher said: “There is as much
difference m some people as anybody.” Geelong
was enraged when the Jook agreed to stop only 15
minutes there, and when it was further suggested
that the train should pass through the town slowly,
and that George of Cornwall and York might be
visible at the window, the offer was denounced by
Geelong as a gross insult and an outrage. And
now West Maitland writes to the papers for the
husks that Geelong rejected with contumely.

The brown sails swing as the fisherfolk sing,
And the boats slide over the bay
With sunshine and tinkle of mandolines,
But thou art so far away ;
And I think of thee all day, my beloved,
I think of thee all day !

I dream of thee all night 1
When on city walls the moonlight falls
So cold, and calm, and white ;
When sea and sky and the earth are still
I am with thee, Heart’s Delight,
For I dream of thee all night, my beloved,

My heart is all thine own, my beloved,
My heart is all thine own !
Whether sunlight glows on the lips of the rose

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, May 28, 1901.
My Dear Arini, —
The Mighty Atom and his Duchess were landed
at Farm Gove to the roaring of cannons, blasts of
music, and bending of bodies—concave bodies like
those of the Gov.-General, and convex bodies like
those of Messrs. Barton and See. His landing
was of the correct, time-honored type, and the
Mighty was affable, and signified his pleasure
with hand and hat-brim. But the loyalty of this
great country didn’t grow keener than it was the
day before yesterday. Now, if the Duke had
stepped ashore with that absurd cocked hat on
the back of his head and waving a bottle with the
saluting hand, all Australia, from Farm Cove to
Cape York, from State Minister to opossum-
snarer, would have loved him with a love surpass-
ing the love of our poet for the gum-tree. The
tie between us and the Mother Country would be
tied tighter (no, no pun intended) than ever it
was by contingents to South Africa hauling at it.
The Duke’s humanity, his nearness to us, would
have been proved. This is not my suggestion ; I
wouldn’t be so rude. It is an artist man’s belief.
And he added meditatively : “ What a splendid
advertisement it would be for me if my name was
on that bottle.”
During the long wait for the procession the
volunteers lining Castlereagh-street, opposite the
Australia, slouched at ease (every woman who
grew tired by standing to her dressmaker’s fittings
felt for those young men) and facetious persons in
the crowd behind them slyly spitted matchboxes
or scraps of paper on tempting bayonets.
National Guardsman Dibbs rode between the lines,
tn route to his own post, smoking an able-bodied
cigar. Same cigar the Prince of Wales gave him
years ago, doubtless. He had saved it up for this
day of days. But some elderly officers on the
stand near me went almost blind with rage at sight
of this breach of military etiquette. Soldiers—
soldiers padding the hoof and soldiers on pigskins,
and a band—then the Mighty Atom’s escort.
Then the Mighty themselves. He, a little weary
by now, and making the salute with half-closed
hand, as if he were picking bees off the brim of
his hat. She, looking very nice and fair, in black
coat and skirt, with violet posy, her light-brown
hair crimped under her small black toque; toque
stabbed through with initial hat-skewer. Now
the initial hatpin will be with us in great plenty.
With the passing of George and May went the
crowd’s interest, and, like a long, uninteresting
boa-constrictor, more soldiers trailed along.
The Yorks are said to be homely people, but
why glorified candlesticks and mantelpieces should
therefore be erected to their honor is inexplicable.
That is the impression some of the arches made
on the mind of this inkpotess. The gleam of the
white was not alluring ; it was cold, spectral,
dreary. The red and blue flags, gleaming against
the dark grey walls and the gloomy sky that
marked our latest Procession Day, had a rather
cheering effect ; not so the arches, with their not
particularly appropriate inscriptions—“ Peace on
Earth, ” and so forth. There is not likely to be
any more peace on earth than there usually is, on
account of the Dook.
Many of the women onlookers were clothed in
mauve from head to heel. One Chinese girl, in
four different shades of this color, had an umbrella
of still another shade, which her Chinese sweet-
heart was Anglicised enough to hold over her
head. While waiting for the procession people
told one another that they were not to clap ; there
seemed to be an impression that this would be
high treason. In the dull atmosphere the banners
spread out brightly and bravely, but there was
rather a redundancy of those small, triangular
affairs that whirl tightly round their strings and
refuse to blow out at the critical moment. All
the horses that had a chance went up and nibbled
at the decorations, while the band played “ Only
a Leaf,” as if gently deprecating their own long
festoons of oreenery put up in honor of Majesty
to be.
I heard one man in the street: “ All the time I
was in Melbourne he never rose his hat once, but
here he’s been rosing it all the time.” Another
woman, as the Royal carriage was approaching,
got excited. “My handkerchief’s dirty, Emma;
lend me yours, quick, to wave to the Duchess.”
The Duchess, like the defunct Trilby, has a
kind, wide smile and the happy, dairymaid look
that speaks of a good temper and good digestion.
When she had moved on, people turned to one
another and said that she was just like their
Annie, and passed similar compliments on her
large, bright personality. Then they tramped
over each other and elbowed one another viciously
beneath the arches marked “Peace on Earth”
and “A United People,” and asked each other
angrily who they were shoving, and went home by
tram-loads. The procession had even more inter-
vals between each item than was usual, and one
man, who had evidently got lost early in the pro-
ceedings, was seen carrying his flag all by himself,
conscientiously doing every street, some time after
the rest of his comrades had passed on.
In the evening the crowd swarmed out once
more, and the city retired behind festooned lights
and long glittering colonnades of color, while on
the invisible Town Hall and other masonry were
drawn delicate tracings of reds and blues and
greens shining far out into the rain -moistened,
noisy darkness.
At the review, on Tuesday, Duchess May’s
tall figure was topped with a small, black, crino-
line toque trimmed with black ostrich tips, and
worn very much on one side. Her skirt
was finely tucked, her coat Eton, and her
black boa was of chiffon edged with flower
trimming. The lady must be unusually tall, for

Hordern Brothers’Arch of Welcome is one of the
few of the city’s decorations that are in good taste
and don’tobstruct the vehiculartraffic, soitdeserves
honorable mention. The arch simulates veined
marble, and is erected inside the firm’s Pitt-street
windows. It is draped with royal mourning
colors, and festooned with pearls and ostrich-
feather boas, and niched in its pillars are wooden
ladies wearing beautiful imported frocks. At the
back of the main arch a lion and a unicorn rage
for a crown, and neither makes much progress
Horderns are showing some toques that are more
becoming and better worth fighting for than the
crown between the two beasties. The firm is also
responsible for some of the best dresses that we
are seeing this week in camp and court and grove
(I like the look of. that phrase, Arini).
The Belle-Cole Concert Co. at the Town Hall last
Saturday struck a moderate audience. The de-
corated and illuminated city and the first night of
“ Mignon ” at the Royal probably accounted for
the dead-marine look of the house. There was a
young Pochotsch, who tootled, years ago here, on
the violin ; he is still a young Pechotsch with a lot
of hair and a wooden expression, and his tootle is
more matured and convincing. With a male
parent he did some harrowingly hilarious lumps of
Bach, and was otherwise remarkable for loitering
in the artists’ exit, hungrily pouncing on encores
Avon Saxon, the manly baritone, who
runs the show, _ belongs to the genus of
artists who “give it lip.” Accordingly,
he sang with his head, shoulders, legs, and all the
rest of him. One expected him to “biff” the
“ Yeoman’s Wedding ” violently in the left optic ;
stupidly, I think, he refrained. His wife, Mdlle.
Cheron, has a brilliant soprano, with (after
Antoinette Trebelli) a suggestion of bricks in it;
which voice, however, she certainly knows how to
use. Belle Cole is a wonderful woman. She
sang “Sweet Genevieve” as an encore, and it
was not only a work of art but a Great Creation.
Rhodda Perry, the weird male alto who was with
Newbery, sang “Sweet Genevieve” here nearly
every Saturday for a long season, and when he
had finished with it it was a ragged, disreputable
ditty that slept in a dust-box, and would have
been hustled off any respectable door-mat. Belle
Cole made a star of it, and it twinkles graciously
in your memory. That’s art !
All women singers seem to be very well in the
matter of shoulders and arms, and consequently
carry evening-dress bravely. Madame Cole and
Mdlle. Cheron are no exceptions. The star wore
white silk with a black over-dress of embroidered
net. Mdlle. had a frock of a beautiful shade of
blue under ivory-white lace, with corsage edgings
of black velvet, a black velvet waist-band, and a
knee-trimming of black velvet. Mdlle. has my
permission to remove that Euclid-looking pattern
from her skirt. It has the effect of shortening
her legs, and it’s a crime for a woman to have
short legs. If a man’s legs are long enough to let
his feet reach the ground when he stands up, that
is quite sufficient; but with a woman it is
different.
The Royal Marine Band concert held at the
Town Hall on Wednesday week was noticeable
for the number of men nursemaids. These men
seemed to be largely responsible for the vocifer-
ous encore given to the cock-crowing in the
“Students’ Return from the Ball.” It was the
sort of item that helped to keep the baby quiet.
So far, Pa’s Wednesday half-holiday has not,
apparently, done him much good; it seemingly
only serves to make a nursemaid of him, and gives
him a chance to be ordered by his wife to take
the children out. But when there was an interval
the male nursemaid, _in many cases, dropped the
small infant in the seat, asked the nearest lady he
was unacquainted with to keep an eye on it, and
went out to see the imperceptible dog which is
always supposed to be getting wet on the front
steps. It is many years now since I heard the
first man say he was going out to see that canine.
It must be very old now, and probably requires
more looking after on that account.
Not standing-room for an eel was there at the
Town Hall when Dr. O’Haran received a cheque
for seven-fifty from Sydney women-sympathisers.
It was a wildly enthusiastic crowd, and it didn’t
spare its lungs or keep its handkerchief in its
pocket. The Cardinal sat back looking at the
joyous storm with an upon-this-rock-I-have-built-
my-chureh expression. Mrs. Freehill, who, later,
presented the cheque, and read an address (speak-
ing downwards into the violets at her throat), was
on the platform, with Mrs. T. Slattery and Miss
Shiels. Dr. O’Haran has a good head for a Catho-
lic priest, not much back to it, and with consider-
able mental and moral swellings in the fore part.
He read his speech in a voice that didn’t carry
much beyond the water-bottle on the chairman’s
table. The Cardinal also read what he had to say.
There was a lot of it, and it cited many instances
where men of God, back even to the 12th century,
had been accused by “perfect ladies,” even as was
Dr. O’Haran. But these gentlemen mostly got
a verdict of “ not guilty ” by direct Divine inter-
position—a miracle happened. There was some
points in living in the good old days for good men.
They sought (and found) direct celestial aid. To-
day they seek Jack Want, and find him if he isn’t
away fishing in Japan.
position of “Gentleman of the Royal
Cellars ” is a billet that must have certain com-
pensations. It is that official—Kingscote by name
—who ordered Curcier Adet Co. to send a hun-
dred dozen of their Royal Household Blend of
Scotch Whisky for the Ophir trip. An office in
which a man can order 1200 bottles of whisky at
one swoop must have some advantages.
If you chance to know any of the Melb. dames
who send me descriptions of their Duking frocks
will you kindly tell them that I rarely chronicle a
gown—never when the wearer writes that she
“wore black sattin profusely embrordered with
sea-queens.” Further, I object to paying two-
pence excess postage for such information.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Mrs. Isaacs, who knows a thing or two about
languages, thinks the Royal pair talk with a very
German accent. But the Germans don’t think so.
Most of us failed to detect any particular breed in
their way of talking. It was just plain accent, or
absence of it. Of course, if everybody else has an
accent, then the only people who have an accent
are the people who have no accent at all.
“ During Celebration Week, Lady Hopetoun
seemed to make a point of dressing severely, and
leaving her brightest diamonds at home. The
tactful Fiarl, no doubt, advised his missus that she
would find favor in the sight of Royalty as an
understudy rather than as a competitor. Those
wiio have seen the Gov.-Generaless in white satin
decolletage, with sweeping train and the Hope-
toun diamonds, hardly need to be told that, ‘ with
’em all on,’ she would, spectacularly speaking,
completely put the Princess’s nose out of joint.
“What fun about those letters the Duchess
threw out of the train-window ! Mrs. Cornwall
fancied, no doubt, that as she was cleaving the
heart of the primeval forest now was her chance
to get rid of rubbish. Loyal people, who beheld
the shower of manna, rushed with tearful eyes to
receive the supposed greetings of their future
Queen.' Also gangers, maintenance gentlemen,
pick-and-shovel artists, and the like, built their
thirsty hopes on delicate little offerings in the
shape of drink money, and swore savagely when
disappointed.
“ One of the most surprising circs, in connection
with the celebration shows, both day and evening,
was the amazing number of old women,—really
aged women, not mere chits of 50 or 60—who
flocked to see all the sights. Apparently infirm,
they waited for hours in densest crowds (O, that
awfully long dreary waiting for Royalty; how
much has this leg-tired city had of it of late !)
ate peanuts for sustenance, and sang the
Anthem for all they were worth, and waved
dingy hankies, with shrill hurrahs, always at the
wrong carriage. At the first Parliamentary ‘at
home,’ a lady sat on Parliament house steps, so
old and feeble that when the time came for her to
rise, her daughter could only move her by dead
haulage. What is the quotation that fits the case
of these decayed revellers ? There is one some-
where but I can’t think it up. Many a matron’s
bones are aching yet for this wildly exciting
break away from the monotonous grind of dailv
life. J
“The prevailing condition of things at the
Fmdon Hamers’ meeting last Wednesday was a
chilling dampness that tinged the nose like the
red, red rose and froze the bones. The small
party in the special pen gathered itself up into a
knot, while the elder part of it withdrew into a
rain-marquee. The Albert Millers played host
and plied their drag-lot with attentions. Chief of
this party was Mrs. Cruickshank in a violet frock
and a blue toque showing a topsy-turvy rakish pink
something in front. Newly-come-out Vera Clarke
wilted in grey. White-haired Ma Miller looked
sprightly in black, though her nose, like that of
the rest, was as rosy as the Jook’s.
“A dressy Dolly Varden figure in a greyish
gathering at the F. H. race-meeting was Mrs. H.
M. Chomley. The hair of the lady, whose hus-
band got a pair of sleeve-links from the dear Duke,
is not nearly as white as Mrs. Miller’s, and her
tastes are infinitely more Spring-like. With a
black costume she wore a tricky little vest, a
coquettish buttoniere and a hat all a-quiver with
bows on wire stems. Mrs. Chomley is frightfully
girlish—so much so that all her grandchildren
invariably refer to her and address her as the
‘Mater.’ No woman grows old these days unless
she happens to have been bom serious. Religion
ages people shockingly.
“On board the Brooklyn at the much-crowded
afternoon shivoo, some of the Melb. girls were
struck with the idea of having Chinese stewards.
They smiled at the U.S. celestial flunkeys and
John thought them ‘welly ni.’ But when the
giddy girls clutched at the Chinamen’s pigtails to
help them through the crowd to the refreshment
tallies, John changed his tune,- for to grab a
Chinky by his sacred pigtail is to o'fer him the
very deadliest of deadly insults. ‘ But the poor
girl didn’t know, you know.’
“ One of the hottest functions of the Mel-
bourne celebrations was an ‘afternoon tea’ given
by the Russian Consul. The commanders and
officers of the warships and several distinguished
Victorian officials, such as George Jenkins, were
invited. The Russian ‘afternoon tea’ began at
1.30 and howled down the corridors of drink and
glory till after 6 in the evening. It was a mag-
nificent banquet, with 20 or more items on the
menu. Toasts were proposed, not in do.iens,
but in hundreds. The toast of every txxly
in the wide world was drunk twice over
in bumpers. First the company drank
them in vodka in honor of Russia, and then
they repeated them in champagne. By 4
o’clock the Russian ‘afternoon tea’ was the
talk of the street, and it was still raging. Songs
were sung in half-a-dozen different languages at
once. The Russian, Dutch, and German officers
began to shake hands with each other and every-
body else, present. There was more vodka, and
the Russians, who apparently reckoned they
owed everything to George Jenkins, surrounded
him. They shook him by the hands, by the coat-
tails, and the beard. They even shook his feet.
Then they shook Jenkins bodily. Last scene of
all was a crushed and suffocated Jenkins sitting in
a big leathern chair with four hairy Russians on
top of him, a)l kissing his bulging forehead. In
the background another Russian was shaking the
leg of the table, with a wild idea that the table
was Jenkins.
“Every girl landing on the Gromoboi at the
Reception, the other Monday night, was met by
Die invitation, painfully enunciated by one of the
Jack Tars of sledge-land, to ‘kindly take her
close off.’ One of the first greeted with this
original request stood by to watch how the rest of
her sex would take it. Such a procession of ex-
pressions she witnessed ! Some cold, some mis-
chievous, some puzzled, some blushful, some
annoyed, some bursting with a desire to pass the
joke on to the shirt-fronted brethren. Tue latter
class was numerous.
Nance O Neil is gone, but one can’t forgive
that ‘ Macbeth ’ music. Intended, no doubt, to
express. Scottish sentiment and spirit, one finds no
fault with its reels and strathspeys, for Macbeth
died 500 years before Calvin was born to freeze
the current of Celtic gaiety. It’s a question
whether Sandy has been dour from the beginning,
or whether he owes his gravity to struggles for
national independence, Calvinistic doctrines and
Covenanting horrors. Admitting, however, that
Rab lamson s bairn may have been born asour-faced
loon scribe would not haveprotested had the ‘Mac-
beth music been pervaded by weird and solemn
melodies, descriptive of ‘ Caledonia, stern and
wild and her unsmileful children. But it was an
awful anachronism to play well-known Presby-
terian psalmody in connection with a person who
died before the Norman Conquest. Jumble
Puritanism and Macbethism up together and
you 11 spoil the flavor of both. One of the psalms
was dished up as sauce to Duncan’s murder, just
as if the Macbeths were religious fanatics, nerving
themselves to slay ‘the spoiler of Zion,’ instead of
a self-seekmg couple plotting a mercenary crime
if Nance was hankering after lofty motives she
should have got into a toga and played Brutus.
“Rickards’ new Opera House is a dream of
dainty carpets and jewelled lamps, but the trouble
is that one can’t see the wood for the trees ; since
opening night all the glories have been hidden by
a solid mass of audience. Jn the d.c., now of
nights, the costuming is mixed. Some circlers
evidently desiring to live up to the nice, clean
theatre, array themselves in evening splendor
while other women sport day-frocks and nurse
large, feathery hats (for every woman sits
hatless in a theatre now). On the stage
Diver wears a tasty suit, black satin with
blue flowers, and the best-dressed of the first-part
charmers strolled round in a glittering silver frock
with a blue lining. Blue is a favorite color with
Rickards co. Irene Franklin’s hose and shoes
are cerulean, and so are Marie Lloyd’s songs.
Mane has also a selection of fancy frocks, but her
most fetching is her trim barmaid’s black silk and
muslin apron.

The dignity of Labor ! A Mount Lyell

called in to attend his housemaid, because “he

Curious early-day experience of a M.L.
medico—Dr. Moncton, formerly of Invercargill.
He received a message that someone “up Winton
way ” had broken his leg, and, packing his medical
appliances on his horse, he started for Winton.
There he was told the case must be at Castle
Rock station, at which place he was told the
word had come from Blackmount. There he
was told a tree had fallen on a man at Te
Anau Lake (100 miles from his starting
point), but when he arrived there he found
he had to go to Eglinton, 20 miles further.
His patient was found with a “ hopelessly-
smashed ” leg, requiring instant amputation
above the knee. “I ground down three
table-knives to narrow
blades and fine edges,”
says the doctor,

A Phil-Mayism from London : A minor

“At last you’ve received the laurel-leaves.”
“That’s nothing,” replied the bard, “I had the

Owing to ill-health, ex-Speaker Joseph
Abbott goes out of N.S.W. politics at the close of
present N.S.W. Parliament, some time this month.
He has had 21 years of it, and in that time has
represented only two constituencies—Gunnedah
for seven years, and Wentworth for fourteen.
Burra, the S.A. township which gave
Speaker Holder political life, and has kept him in
Parliament for 12 years without causing a
moment’s anxiety for the safety of his seat, is one
of the most dejected “extinct volcanoes” of the
continent —a pitiful example of that most pitiful
sight, a deserted mining field. Successively,
Holder was public school teacher (his father was
ditto), town clerk, and proprietor and editor of
the little woe-begone weekly sheet of the place.
Up to now Holder has been one of the humblest
men in the front rank of Australian politics. The
depressing influence of Burra would make any
politician humble.

shooting expedition a certain Melbourne tailor
was asked to lend two especially valuable dogs.
He wasn’t invited himself. Tailor replied by
blandly inquiring how it came to pass that his
dogs were considered good enough to associate
with the Jook while he wasn’t. Then a gloom fell
over the proceedings.
Seddon’s chief fault in his old age is an
incurable verbosity. At the luncheon to the re-
turned contingenters, at Dunedin, he got up to
propose a toast and, after observing, “ This is not
a time for long speeches,” he held forth for
over half-an-hour. Even in a Presbyterian church,
where they believe in a material hell, the sermon
is hardly as long as that nowadays.
Stated in Melbourne that one big poten-
tate flatly refused to have the Jook shooting on
his premises. Perhaps he didn’t like shooting
with a man of such high rank that, if the visitor
fired wildly and plugged his host, the host would
be expected to say in his last moments that he was
quite satisfied with the arrangement and rather
preferred things that way than otherwise.
Chevalier E. de Martino, “ marine painter
extraordinary to her late Majesty the Queen,”
and artistic lackey or dauber-on-the-premises to

the “Landing of the Duke at Hobson’s Bay.”
Nobody that anybody has heard of has seen any
work of this master, but as he was one of Vic-
toria’s “ discoveries,” his inartistic eminence may
be guessed at.
The remains of the six members of the

Dead and alive, these six have stood a good deal

Many people will regret to hear of the
death of Mr. Benjamin Thomas Lacy, founder of
the business of Parke and Lacy Co., Limited, of
Sydney and Melbourne, and of Parke and Lacy
Co., of San Francisco and London. Mr. Lacy,

well-known in mining circles, and had innumer-
able friends in this country. He was an Irish-
man by birth, and resided chiefly in San Francisco.
He died at Monterey, California.
Agents-General are notoriously an abject
crowd, but a certain Horace Tozer comes easily
first among them. Thus Horace in the Empike
Review :
Many most gracious acts of kindness of a personal
character have been bestowed upon the colony and its
institutions. In particular I remember with pride the
presentation to the Parliamentary library of two of her
own literary works which are still treasured and shown
there to every visitor as a mark of Royal favor.
Two whole books ! Why Alderman Cohen has
often given away two copies of his famous novel
“ How Will It End ” on his way home from the
office at night. And the present writer has
thrown more books than that at a stray dog.
The real power behind the prospective
throne of George V. is Lord Wenlock, the white-
moustachioed, military-looking old gentleman who
accompanies H.R.H. everywhere during the pre-
sent tour. Wenlock it is who pulls all the strings.
The Jookoyork has him by his side at all official
functions, and even when the dinners are so
arranged that there is no available space for Wen-
lock at the elbow of Royalty, he sits opposite with
a cold, calm eye ready to give George “ the office ”
by a Royal system of tick-tacking and get him out
of any embarrassing situation that may arise.
One of these days the public will marvel when
they see Wenlock standing a few hundred yards
away from the Royal party, energetically pulling
his nose, touching his right ear, slapping his thigh
and bowing vigorously to himself in order that
the utterances of the Jook may not involve a war
with Russia.
Speakei’ships, this

spects the best

N.S.W., comes from a small country-paper
office. In fact, on, the mainland, Lee Steere,
of Westralia, is the only Speaker who isn’t
“quite a common sort of person.” And Lee
Steere succeeded to the billet in the land of com-
fortable family arrangements ; he stepped in
when his pa-in-law, Luke Leake, stepped out.
Carrie Nation, the Kansas liquor bar-
smasher : —
I am in the hands of the Lord. I will do no smashing-
in any other State until all the hell-holes in Kansas are
wiped' out of existence. Then I will organise a band of

Charleston, one of S.A.’s Senators, who is
expected to vote on the Tory side in Eederal
politics, was originally elected to S.A. Council as
a Labor nominee, but was boldly included in the
Ass. Federal ticket last March. Charleston,
originally a working engineer and Protectionist,
is now one of the leaders of the S.A. Freetrade
and Liberal (?) Ass, and for years voted with the
Ass. party against almost every measure of the
Kingston Govt.
So far, Bigjolm Forrest looms rather
ridiculously in his new sphere. He threatens
members with his large stomach and strident
voice, and sadly misses the respect he commanded
in the West. John has a way of stating what he
will have and what he will not have, in the manner
of a nigger-driver who has been accustomed to see
his nigger jump promptly. And the House laughs
at him. In Federal politics John runs a terrible
risk of finding himself out.
Ap opus of the recent suicide of the Prime
Minister of Wurtemburg, a pamphlet published
150 years ago recorded the fate of 31 Prime
Ministers of England up to that date. Ten died
by the axe, four in prison, four in exile, three
were hanged, three were “killed by sturdy beg-
gars,” two “died untimely deaths by private
hands,” one “died penitent,” and four were
“ saved by sacrificing their masters.” During the
last 100 years only two English Premiers have
died tragic deaths. The billet is a safer one than
it was in the olden time.
“ P.X.” : Add to the doings of that Nolan
family of remarkable prospectors ( apropos the
death of another of them, Morris, in the west;
B. 18/5/T) that they projected the water scheme
which now supplies Broken Hill, and actually
started the works. The affair brought them
nothing. It was mentioned that the brothers had
prospected Vie., N.S.W., Q., New Guinea, and
W.A. Add to that Tas. (in the early days of
Zeehan and Dundas) and S.A. Some day I’m
going to make a book out of the Nolan brother-
hood.
Longevity is the last of all the privileges
that moneyed rank enjoys. The mother of Lord
Rosebery died the other day, aged 82. She was
a daughter of Earl Stanhope, and bridesmaid
to Queen Victoria. Her first husband, the eldest
son of Rosebery’s grandfather, happened to
decease before he had succeeded to the earldom,
and subsequently she put herself further beyond
the reach of poverty by marrying the Duke of
Cleveland. Presuming that this old lady was the
sole survivor of the party, can anyone state the
average age achieved by the late Queen and her
bridesmaids.
Mortimer Menpes, the South Australian
artist who is credited with making a huge income
in London, has a drawing of Cecil Rhodes repro-
duced in the last number of the Studio. The
drawing, evidently made with a brush of Indian
ink, consists of flat black masses ; and, though
nearly the whole of Rhodes’s face is in shadow,
the portrait is an excellent one, and the whole
character of the man is revealed in the small
circular high light on the tip of his Hebraic nose.
Is it possible for a man so utterly Jewish in
nature and appearance to be the Gentile that
Rhodes claims to be ?
Poor old Arabi Pasha, whose bungalow at
Colombo was one of the objects of pilgrimage by
curious Australian travellers, has been allowed to
go back to Egypt. He was a melancholy sight,
with his tall bent figure, and eyes almost blind,
and his constant complaint at the brutality of the
British in only allowing him a pitifully inadequate
allowance of four wives. But Arabi wasn’t quite
the ruin he looked. It is still remembered in
Colombo how a cocky Australian cricketer who
jibed at the old man about his defeat was passed
gently but firmly into the road by the six-foot-
three Egyptian exile.
H. G. on the physical aspect of royalty :
The Duke and Duchess stand as object lessons to
students of medical science. The Duke’s weak frame,
nervous hesitant manner, and weary face are the in-
evitable results of centuries of cousin marriage and
other in-breeding, while the Duchess’s square, well-set
shoulders, broad hips, and full bust proclaim her plebeian

strain to the world. Everybody says, or at least thinks,
“ Poor little beggar” when referring to the Duke, and
every man cries fervently “ She is a line woman ! ” when
his eye lights on the strapping Princess with the bunch
of violets and the diamond earrings. The duchess is not
pretty, but she is the sort of woman every man looks at
and looks at hard, while nobody would give her
husband a second glance if he met him in a Turkish
bath and fancied his name was Smith.
Isaac Nichols was the first Australasian
postmaster ; in fact, the first Postmaster-General.
He was appointed under an order of Macquarie,
dated “ Headquarters, 25th April, 1809.” It was
his business to board ships and take delivery of
the mails. “In consideration of the trouble and
expense attending on the duty,” he was authorised
to make these charges on delivery:—“ For every
letter, Is.; for every parcel not exceeding 201bs.
weight, 2s. fid. ; and for all exceeding that weight,
ss. Soldiers’ letters, Id.” Then there was this
precautionary provision : “ A list to be published
m the Gazette of the names and addresses of
persons to whom letters and parcels are directed.”
When the Duke of Edinburgh visited Bal-
larat, in ’6B, the directors of the Band and Albion
Consols Co. took him to the lowest level of the
mine, and, placing a double-pointed pick in his
hand, told him that if he worked on the face of
the drive he would unearth a handsome nugget
(the same had been planted there). H.R.H.,
being keen on gold, let fly with a will and struck
his forehead with the pick. A good deal of
ordinary red—not blue —blood came down on his
shirt-front. But the Duke persevered and got
the nugget. When portable property was in
view H.R.H. would have struggled on even if his
vitals had fallen on his shirt-shirt.
Eulogistic biographies of H. C. E. Cliilaers
(Victorian politician of the early ’so’s and after-
wards British Chancellor of the Exchequer) have
lately been appearing. Yet Childers was only
the plainest of mediocrities. He is remember-
some in Victoria for two things. For an immense
number of years he cost that State £866 a year for
having been a very inefficient imported Govern-
ment functionary in the days of Irresponsible
Government. Also he was Vic. Auditor-General
for about a year, and £283,745 of public money
vanished in that time, and hasn’t been accounted
for to this day. Childers’ auditing was apparently
a work of a genius.
The public moan of Alick Forrest (extract
from the West Austbalian) :
He had known that he was to get the C.M.G.-ship, and
he had believed that he would get the title of K.O.M.G.
However, while he was up in Kimberley, recently, he re-
ceived a telegram that, as the Mayors of all the Australian
capitals wanted knighthoods, that title could be conferred
upon only the Mayors of Sydney and Melbourne, while
the others would be offered the title of C.M.G. He was
told that he might havb that, and was strongly recom-
mended to accept it, as it was generally followed by the
higher title. On those terms he accepted it. (Laughter.)
It seemed strange that a man who had been six years
Mayor of Perth, 15 years in Parliament, and 10 years
Government whip, and had explored a large extent of
country, should be made only a C.M.G., while the Mayors
of Melbourne and Sydney, who had held office only since
November last, should receive knighthoods. When the
royal party’ came to Adelaide and Tasmania, they might
find some resentment at it.
“He was told he might have that.” A case of
“ come round to the back-door and some cold meat
will be handed out.”

Re the jackass that sat and sang to 10,000 of his
brethren from Royal Arch on the bridge—that jack is one
of a pair that came to town on Blazen Powell’s drunk ;
that’s tile cock-jack—know him by his cross eye. His
partner got killed trying to prove that snake-yarn. She
had a bang tail, like Governors’ horses. Laughed the
solo parts—Cross-eye jined in like. Thousands of people;
like me, if not too drunk, heard and seen this pair. Sat
mostly on public building. Seemed real pleased when
Peacock came out and jined in a three, O. I seed that
myself. I said to my wife, when I went ’ome next day,
“ Peacock ’ll be Premier.” My wife inquired if that was
the latest brand, and where I got that old hat. Well, the
next time I meet them pair of jacks was in the Melb.
bo»e-vard, at the planting of a dear friend. I see the pic-
ture now—the dear departed on the skids ; the fat, clean-
faced sky-pilot at the bow ; the grave-digger, hat in hand,
looking quite sorrowful and dry—as if he knew the de-
parted ; The undertaker’s men looked tired and dry also.
Harps, crowns, and halo, etc., were handed round. All
stood round and looked our best. “Steady,” said a voice.-
Snap—the voice of the preacher was heard—so was the
vo’c iof them two Jacks. Well they laughed like —yes—
just like that-er Peacock. The good man in his mind
prayed for the repose of the soul of them Jacks overhead.
The law protects Jackasses that have no decency, even at
a planting- anyhow the ptiotos came and—well I shudder
when I think if these two wretched Peacock Jacks had
only came to town on Queen’s Weeping dav— great Scott
and protected too —the villians. Wax. Madden would

the Act, called out our trusty Tom Price and his pork

Then —I’m only thinking—our own white knight would
rush-wire ’Ome in the name of himself and Australia that
the insult to himself and Australia had been wiped out
in the jackasses’ blood. The silken bedclothes drawn
closer. I rise to make a think —offer reward, catch that

*H.S.”: He that curious creature, the
dugong (Halicore Australis) —which, with its
three allied species, the manatees of America and
Africa, has given rise to the mermaid-myth. It
inhabits northern Australian waters, as far oyer
as Cambridge Gulf. It is smooth-skinned with
atrophied hind limbs and two large anterior

oil, which is valuable for medicinal and other pur-
poses, is worth up to 20s. a gallon, the yield per
animal being from sto lOgals. The salted flesh
is fairly palatable. The aborigines go after
dugong" on moonlight nights in canoes, with
large heavy spears attached to strong lines.
Their plan is to steal cautiously up to the animal
and spear it first in the hinder parts and then in
the mouth or nose, by which means it is soon
drowned. The hides (over an inch thick when
tanned) are worth about 4d. per lb. green, and
the bones are very dense and heavy. The dugong-
spear is fully 14ft long, with a heavy clublike butt.
The big end is hollow and encloses a barb to
which the line is attached. About 150 years ago
there was killed in Behring Sea the last-known
specimen of a species of the same genus, which
was double the size of the existing dugong.
Kap I used to believe, with many
other bushmen, that a horse could not swim in
hobbles. One evening mate and I camped beside
a lake, m Western N.S.W., which had an island
in it. lo secure our nags we swam them over
about 200 yards of water, hobbled them, and swam
back ourselves to camp. Next morning we were
horrified to find horses missing. After some
trouble we tracked them to water’s edge, when
my mate dolefully remarked that if we went in a
bit we d find them underneath. But an inspec-
tion of the opposite bank revealed the track of
them leaving the water, and we found them both
safe and sound in a valley a mile or so away.
Something new—and true. At the No
Luck mine ( \ ic.) there Was a Chinaman engaged
underground, to whom the other men soon evinced
much repugnance. The new mining manager, to
whom complaint was made, did not care aboub
sacking him off-hand, but hinted to the spokes-
man that if there was a row it might result in the
yellow man leaving. Next shift the spokesman
lurched heavily against the Chow, while a mate
was at hand to improve the situation if the Chow
resented. But the mate hadn’t time to do any-
thing, for the Chow, evidently suspicious, wheeled
round and landed the lurcher two beauties that
put him senseless on his back, and followed tliis
up by chasing the second man right out of the
Ar lVe ’ manager then declined to move the
Mongolian, but the two whites came to the con-
clusion that underground work didn’t agree with
them.

“ Scotty ” on rabbit-destruction :
You can’t destroy well-placed rabbits. “J.W.C.”,
wit h bis one bag of pollard per mile, is an almighty ex-
pensive person. Take an ordinary run, say 30x30 miles =
0)0 s.m. That’s £9OO or more on the average, including
haulage and loss ; and it’s worth £2 more per mile for
distribution and revision. That’s £2700. Now, rum must
be subdivided into at least 36 paddocks in order to pre-
vent immigration and emigration. Rabbits get tired of
pollard and match-heads. 'Well, there’s 36x36miles = 1296
miles of wire-netting, which, putting same on made fences
and allowing extra cost for gates, gullies, rocks, etc.,
we’ll call £2O a mile (it’s more). Pay up another £25,920,
making with extras (say) £3o,ooo—which is just what
Robertson, of Oolac, is reported to have spent 40 years
ago, and his run is still good trapping-ground.

“Monaroite” : Bombala (N.S.W.) had a
fire the other night, and a
small wooden building was
reduced to ashes. The pre-
mises on each side were saved
by the heroic exertions of
about 300 men and the police.
When the average crowd goes
to save a place that place is
lost. There were three sick
women in one of the houses,
and they were thrown through
a window without time to
dress—the crowd had previ-
ously wrecked the windows
with its boots to facilitate
the salvage operations. Then
the household goods poured
through the broken casements
like a flight of grasshoppers,
and in an incredibly short
time everything was saved,
and either broken, lost or
trodden upon. Later on,
when it was found that the
fire wasn’t spreading after all,
the wreckage was carried back,
and the sick women got to
bed again in hysterics, and the
two houses looked as if they
had been rushed by herds of
buffaloes. Thus do the
brighter and nobler instincts of
humanity break through the
outer crust of. selfishness. There is
nothing more beautiful than a ten-
dency to help a distressed brother
or sister —even when it shows
itself by a needless and misguided
throwing of the brother’s tea-set
into the middle of the street, and
a rushing of the undressed sister
out into the public gaze.

Notes from a bushman’s diary :
Wednesday.— lt was late when we reached Melbourne.
It was raining, too, and bitterly cold at that. Orainped,
worn out, and sleepy, we were glad to take the first
accommodation that was offered. This was at an
alleged boarding-honse kept by two persons named
Murphy. We stayed there three days. The menu
for breakfast never altered—fried steak and onions, cold
and greasy. Michael carved the bread against his shirt.
Slices the size of a small plate, and an inch thick. He
also waited at table. He had the old bog habit of stealing
round on tiptoe and breathing confidentially in. one’s ear
when he thought anything was wanted. I believe this is
a hereditary instinct acquired through many generations
of lying in wait for the landlord.
Our room was 8 x 10, and contained three single beds.
The occupants were two men, two women, and three
children.
The price of meals had risen 150 per cent, since the city
had been exalted by the presence of a real live duke. I
breathed his name with great fervor each time I parted
up. So, keeping him so constantly in memory, I may be
considered a loyal subject.
All the restaurants were crowded to the doors. Our
plan was to note who was eating pudding—the last
course—and mortgage his chair by standing over it till he
was finished, and then fight for it if necessary. Once a
Bendigo soldier had mortgaged the next chair to mine,
and caused much indignation to a fat old gent by the
simple remark, “By God, this old cow eats a lot 1 ” The
old party rose with his mouth full of hot jam-roll and
told us that he was opposed to Jingoism since soldiers
stood over civilians in cafCs and placed restrictions on
their appetites. After which he had some more jam-roll.
We saw most of the sights. First sight we saw was a
woman of 14st. lying prostrate on the footpath, with a
flask gripped in one hand, asking the pavement “ Who
the h—’s the duke?” and telling it in answer that she
was as good as several kinds of awful duchesses. Gross-
ing Elizabeth-street, we saw two sailors bashing a citizen
for “ pushin’ us out of yer blanky way.”
Later we were attracted by immense applause, and
hurried to the spot. Found that a crowd which had
grown weary of waiting for the Duke was giving three
cheers for a passing sanitary cart.
Then we went into a hotel for another drink, and woke
up four days later in the Fitzroy Gardens. By that time
the Duke was gone. So were our boots. I wonder if he
took them.

“Eller”: A cow belonging to Mr. W.
Yitchic, of Stanthorpe, Q., was sick, and appa-
rently in such agony that he killed her. A post-
mortem revealed, in the animal’s inside, a death-
adder 2ft. 2in. long; dead, of course, but otherwise
uninjured. Local residents can verify.

The Victorian farmer’s plaint that he can’t

Man with the Hoe. Wages, ss. to 7s. 6d. a week

on the land finds helots scarce, while half-time or
even casual work can be got in the cities at civi-

He was up before a N.S.W. country Bench
for “drunk and disorderly, “and was fined ss. He
hadn’t the money, and pleaded pathetically to the
Bench to settle. “ Yer know, George, ole man,
there’s twelve bob owin’ me on them last ’possum-
skins you got.” The Bench threatened to deal with
him for “contempt of court,” and a scene was
only averted by a stalwart trap getting accused
down and holding a huge paw over his mouth un-
til the court was cleared.

“Eller”: Pe flesh-eating horses. In
nine cases out of ten this habit has been acquired
when the animal was young. Foals will nibble at
anything. Have seen one eating liver that had
been thrown to fowls.
When one of the detachments
of N.S.W. Lancers sent to S’ Africa
readied its first standing-camp it
saw some episodes more funny than
tragic. In one a pig was concerned.
An Australian Cavalry Major was
sitting in his sark, industriously
mending a rent in his pants. It
was just after Paavdeberg, and
after the commandeering of some
hundredsof waggon-loadsof British
supplies by I)e Wet. so biscuits
were short, and majors and troopers
alike were hungry as well as a oit
ragged. A pig dashed down the
lines towards the Major's camp.
Where the animal came from no
one ever knew. The Major-, with
visions before him of savoury pork
chops for tea, snapped up lus
sword, and dropping Lis nether
garments, gave chase, lunging with
right good will as he ran. The
hullabullo attracted attention, and
other hungry fellows, officers and
men-i-pure-bloo led subalterns and
“ rank outsiders ” of no class at all
—joined in the hunt. Too hungry
to regard eccentricities of costume,
no one, save, perhaps, the newly-
arrived men, noticed the figure-
head of the weird chase till the
Major, after leading his hetero-
geneous army through the Lancer-
lines, past the Enniskillens, then
through the Carbineers, and then
the Guards, at length gave up the
wild pursuit, and returned with
his shirt-tails flapping merrily in
the breeze, but with no pig.

Dear Bulletin. “ Shot ”
(8., 16/2/’01) says there never were
4000 cattle in the Bloomfield dis-
trict, alive or dead. Well, the
man I got the information from
lives at China camp, 70 miles from
Cooktown, and about 14 from the
river. He has been 17 years there
and supplied Cooktown and sur-
roundings with meat, lie assures
me that before the ticks came he
had 6000 head, and now has not
1000.—W.M.8., Cooktown (N.Q.).
“ Targah ” : Near Oooran (Q.) I once
overtook two exhausted-looking aboriginals carry-
ing a gin apparently very ill. Watched them
stagger up to a house, from which they were
turned away. Had same refusal at next house,
after which they staggered off towards the hotel
paddock. Soon afterwards I was surprised to see
the same gin busy light ing a fire. Upon being in-
terrogated about her quick recovery, she calmly
replied, “Baal those people gib it tucker, no
plurry use being sick.”

“ Boko ” : The common ant-lion is a most
interesting insect to observe. Kept in a shallow
box of clean, dry sand, and well supplied with
ants, they work vigorously at their pitfalls, going
backwards in a circle and throwing the sand out
with the head. When the first circle has been
completed they reverse the motion, making
another inside —and so on until the trap is com-
plete. Lying at the bottom, the “ lion ” remains
concealed under the sand until an ant falls in. If
at first snap the prey escapes the waiting jaws,
the lion sharply flips sand up with his head,
causing the side to fall in and bring the ant back
to him. Ant-lions are very common round Sydney,
but it is not easy to catch them, as they are not
usually more than a-quarter of an inch long, har-
monise in hue with the sand, and can burrow
away very rapidly. Best way is to lean over the
hole and blow strongly. The sand goes, leaving
lion exposed. -


Residents of Maclean (N.S.W.) are getting
a lot of amusement out of their municipal council.
A difference of opinion over proposed baths led to
the retirement of Aid. Burt, who was nominated
for re-election. The opposition party nominated
an eccentric character named Meek, the local bell-
ringer and bill-poster, a dwarf in stature, and a
person of concealed knowledge. Burt withdrew
from the contest in disgust, and Meek was re-
turned unopposed. Various ratepayers bought
him a second-hand silk hat and other articles of
attire in keeping with his new dignity ; and at
latest advices the new alderman was hawking his
own photoes round the town, and taking himself
very seriously on the whole. Photo, of the new
alderman in his second-hand tall hat appears in
this issue.

The plaintiff in the principal case turned out to
be a friend of the bench. After he had
finished giving his evidence, his Worship beckoned
him over, shook hands, inquired after his (plain-
tiff’s) brothers, sisters, cousins and aunts, ex-
pressed pleasure at their welfare, and—gave a
verdict for defendant. Meeting the latter shortly
afterwards, I stated that I thought it was all up
when I saw what a friendly interest the Bench
took in the plaintiff. “Oh !” he replied, “that’s
nothing; I was with the Attorney-General till
two o’clock this morning. I guess he fixed things.”

The Hotelkeeper and the Tourist.
“ I liad the pleasure of a long chat with Mr.
John Graham, whilst passing through Copman-
hurst, Clarence River,” writes a tourist. “We
were talking about dangerous experiences, and
Mr. Graham, who is the popular proprietor of the
‘Copmanhurst Hotel,’ gave his story so interest-
ingly that I send it on for publication.”
“Ten years ago, being then fifty-eight,” said
Mr. Graham, “ I was startled one morning by
sharp pains running through my feet. Later on,
my feet swelled to an enormous size, and the
pains spread right through my body. A doctor
who was called in said 1 had a very severe attack
of rheumatic gout, but despite his attention I did
not recover. 1 had one stretch of five months in
bed, and during other attacks was unable to walk
for weeks. 1 had to be fed by hand, being power-
less to move. If I wished to change my position
in bed, three men had to lift me. Another doctor
was called in, and, although 1 followed the
medical instructions carefully, and touched no
spirits of any kind, I still remained a sufferer.
Outward applications and herbal remedies proved
quite useless.”
“ Were you in this plight for ten years ?”
“Yes,” said Mr. Graham, “I was.”
“ But you look healthy and hearty enough
now.”
“Yes, because my wife induced me to take Dr.
Williams’ pink pills. After I had taken one box
I felt relieved. My appetite returned, the swell-
ing went down, and the pain subsided. Before I
had used eight boxes I was a strong, robust,
healthy man, free from pain and every vestige of
rheumatic gout. lam well known in the Clarence
River and New England districts, and many
people in this town can tell you how I suffered.”
It is impure blood that causes rheumatism,
rheumatic gout, sciatica and lumbago ; thus when
the damp, cold weather comes, or the patient gets
wet, the agonies begin, because the blood, im-
poverished and acid, only needs something to
start the pain. Dr. Williams’ pink pills enrich
the blood and cure rheumatism and attendant ail-
ments. As blood builder and nerve tonic, they also
cure anaemia, debility, neuralgia, colds, effects of
influenza and fevers, bronchitis, consumption of
the bowels and lungs, heart weaknesses, dysentery,

Dear Bulletin.
—Re horses scratch-
ing for water (“ P. L., ”
8., 30/3/’01). Writer,
while travelling sheep
from Robe River(nor’-
west) to Perth (W.A.)
via Cue, in ’96, came
across a long, dry
stretch where sheep
went without water
for seven days, and
men scratched and
watered camp horses
from damper-dishes.
In the bed of a creek
about 50 miles from
Peak Hill, we struck
a wild, white •• eyed
chestnut mare, “dog-
jKior,” with a foal.
The mare had
scratched about 2ft.
to lied-rock and de-
fended her little well
viciously. It took two
mounted men with
whips to keep her at
a distance while the
third man filled and
re filled a dish for the
camp horses and bags
for cooking. Have
met with other in-
stances of horses fol-
lowing the kangaroo’s
example in this way.
—R.L W.
Out in the far
West (N.S.W.),' one
census-taker, sent
back to the Q. border
from Broken Hill,
travelled by bike 1440
miles, for the most
part through desert
to which the alleged
break-up of the
drought has not made
any difference what-
ever. Another collec-
tor, sent out East from
the same place,
dropped two horses
by the waterless and
feed less track ; at one
place a feed .for two
horses cost 14s. The
most striking thing
another saw was a
butcher’s shop in a
township described
as “ the centre of a
large pastoral dis-
trict” shut up be-
cause there wasn’t
anything left to kill.
The township hadn’t
seen any fresh meat
except what had come by parcels post for
over three months. In the worst of these dis-
tricts the collectors filled in the papers as they
went—a second journey was out of the question.
Not that it would have affected the totals much if
they had been missed altogether.

“ Pyal'a” : lie aboriginal custom of des-
troying deformed children (B. 9/3/01). Infanticide
is largely practised among the natives of N.S.
Wales and Central Australia ; the practice being
due probably to the difficulty of providing for two
children of closely-approaeliing ages. The gins
generally suckle a child up to the age of three
years, and sometimes four ; and, if another hap-
pens along during that time, they simply kill it at
birth. Very rarely does infanticide take place
when the child is a few years old. In such cases,
object is to better rear a weakly, but older child,
the survivor being supposed to gain the strength
of the killed one.

Stockwhip : In England a foreigner can be naturalised if
(1) he has lived in the United Kingdon for at least five
years or been that period in the British service ; (2) if
he convinces the authorities that he intends to
continue in the United Kingdom or in the British
service; (3) if he pays £5. Naturalisation is not a right
even then, and may still be refused. When naturalised,
he gets a vote for the Lower House of the British Parlia-
ment —nobody has a vote for the Upper House. In the
Transvaal before the war, a foreigner could, after two
years’ residence and on payment of £2, become a
“ second-class burgher,” with a vote for the Lower
House ; and he might (though he seldom did) become a
“ first-class burgher,” with a vote for both Houses
twelve years later. Many British States grant
naturalisation on much easier terms than Britain
does, but it only holds good in that one State

leave off publishing The Bulletin, and instead of address-
ing 4,000,000 people they would get a chance to talk to
perhaps 70 —including Brunker, whose placid, ox-like
gaze would probably so break them up that they couldn’t
talk at all H.P. (Ararat): (1) Goods are not always
bought with goods ; Australia’s foreign public and private
debts (say £320,000,000) mostly came out here in the
shape of goods, and represent goods bought with I O U’s.
(4) If you open the Australian market freely to the cheap
foreigner’s cheap goods, then the Australian must either
produce as cheaply as these foreigners in order to get
work (which means cutting down wages), or go some-
where else. And that is why no Australian State dares to
practise Freetrade. Questions 2 and 3 are practically the
same over again... .Morgan H. : Yarn too tremendous....
E.R.P. : Metre too erratic Bodkin : Humor stretched
out like atom heretic H. 8.5.: “Constancy” will do.
....M.S. : “The Drunks” wholly commonplace... .Mrs.
Murphy’s Dream : Persons who dream things like that
should be hanged....F. A. Lord, or Yord, or Zord, or
Fiord (Howlong) :It is his son’s portrait Numscull:
Ye Gods—the same old conundrum again ! It is his son’s
portrait.... The Youth: Poem destroyed N.S. : Dull
verses F.S.D. : Mellarrne article Nov. 5, 1898.... J.II. :
You’re right in theory ; but t’other spelling is more com-
monly used Pedlar : B. sonnet not enough general
interest C.C. : Written on thin paper and blotted
almost past recognition.. ..Cerne : Inferior J. M‘G.
(Bardoc): (1) No ; (2) No Subscriber (Wyalong): Is
there any report available of the speech in which your
bounding alderman defended his conduct in sacking a
man for voting against him in the local municipal
council?.... Letter for the Secretary, Hawaiian Planters
Association, at this office... .Curate: Two decent verses :
There is steps a man can take
Which may mar him or may make,
An’ ’e oughter be awake
When ’e takes ’em.
There is vows a man can make
That may benefit or break,
An’ ’e oughter be awake
When ’e makes ’em.
. ..Louis M. : “Cameron” pretty good, but it doesn’t
quite arrive... .Cuss : Stories are both too hoary A
Motley Fool: Will deal with the Bird question shortly.. ..
Young Australia : The Federal Capital Site which Oliver
recommended most (Monaro) has its sea outlet at Eden,
about 80 miles away, with a mountain rampart in between
for protection. Paris is about the same distance from the
sea. Washington is only 30 miles from the coast. And they
have no mountain rampart in between T.P.0.: Good
lines here and there, but when your ideas ran short you
threw in platitudes, and you let your metre get you
down and bite you. A poet needs to fix his metre with
his glassy eye, and keep it in subjection all the time.
R.A.M. : About half of nothing... .B.G. : More
Jook-doggerel Alice E. : Rather too vague.... No-
rtherner : You say the white man can’t work in North
Queensland (he does work in Croydon mines); and “if it
wasn’t for the Chinaman there wouldn’t be a green veget-
able at Charters Towers.” Do you know what you are
dreaming about. China is mostly a temperate country,
and part of it a bitterly cold country where rivers freeze
in winter. Japan is much the same. If the Chow fresh
from China can work in North Queensland the white men
of all parts of Australia and Maoriland can F.B. :
“Brennan” pretty good, but it is difficult to
make much joy out of a horse-race yarn....
H.N. : When The' Bulletin said that Irishwomen were
more virtuous than the average it spoke by book— you
only speak by mouth. Take the birth statistics of Europe
(Mulhall’s “ Dictionary of Statistics,” page 645) : Rou-
mania, 14 illegitimates out of every 1000 births ; Ireland,
26 ; Holland, 29 ; Russia, 31; England, 42 ; Switzerland,
45 ; Italy, 64; Norway, 71; Scotland, 72 ; Hungary, 85 ;
Belgium, 87 ; France, 88; Germany, 91 ; Denmark, 101 ;
Sweden, 107 ; Portugal, 123 ; Austria, 145... .H.O. : That
was a new patent ship, and evidently beyond ordinary
comprehension.
SET IT DOWN TO THE JOOK.
SHE: “Mime, Bill, what's all this about fishin'
to-day?”
HE: “Oh, I suppose the Jook's going to fish and
vie've all got ter jine in.”

At Queanbeyan, a defendant, who, on his sign, called himself a '* Chinefr
physician and surgeon,” and who also “ went round with the vegetable cart,” Wa >
proceeded against on an information that he had used a title implying that he was a
duly qualified medical practitioner, to wit “ physician.” The information was dis
missed. Here is a tip for the “ duly qualified ”in a profession which is notoriously
over-manned.
Mr. O’Sullivan'
was recently laid
up for a week
with a bad cold.
“ After the accident to the Shamrock
11, the King showed great nerve
Alter reassuring the ladies he lighted a
cigar " —Cable
Jf this k worth cabling it's worth
a picture.
His Faithful Attendant (to a deputa-
tion from the Goshen Flat Progress
Association) : “ You’ll really have to
call again ; he’s lost his voice, and will
not be able to promise anything for a.
/ week f"
“ Wheb on Monday, after tie
passing of the Royal procession,
thousands of people wander
through the streets devoting their
attentioi* particularly to the decor-
ations, their opinions will be voiced
in a limited vocabulary by such
expressions as‘Very nice!’ ‘That’s
good ! Isn’t it lovely ? ’ and so
forth. But it is safe to say
that not one in every hundred
will have the least conception
of the immense amount of
thought, time, and work that
has been devoted to secure
ing the effective embel-
lishments that- will
adorn the streets.”

What is depicted below did not come off, but it might have.
Here you have a view of
fast Monday’s demonstration
in Sydney, as seen by resi-
dents of Mosman.
And here you see an artist sending these presents over to
The Bulletin office in the form of a kite. What with
being at the mercy of the “ Best Ferry Ser-
vice in the world,” high rates, break-neck
roads, and an eccentric tram service,
Mosman is getting to be _a fine place to
•emigrate froja

ROYAL PRESENTS AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEM.
" Mr. Edmund Barton, Prime Minister of Australia, received from the hands of the Duke a most beautiful gold snuff-box, about 4in. long by 4in. broad and 2in. deep. It was handsomely
embellished, and bore on the lid the Royal arms and monogram in blue enamel, a large crown of rubies, the three Prince of Wales’ feathers in diamonds, tied in a clasp of emeralds, while on the
right and left sides of the cover were six large diamonds of considerable value. Mr. George Jenkins, Clerk of the Federal House of Representatives, was most graciously received by their Royal
Highnesses, and the Duke, in saying good-bye to Mr. Jenkins, presented him, as a mark of regard, with a gold pencil-case bearing the white rose of York and the badge of the Order of the Garter
in enamel. To Mr. Chomley, Chief Commissioner of Police, the Duke handed, on behalf of himself and the Duchess, a pair of sleeve-links, with the white rose of York in enamel. Mr. M'Culloch,
chairman of the celebrations committee, was presented with a gold cigarette case, bearing the Royal arms, with a monogram in the centre. The Premier (Mr. A. J. Peacock) received, as a souvenir,
autograph photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York. His Royal Highness presented to Sir John Madden a handsome card salver of solid silver and elegant workmanship. The
salver rests on four silver supports, and bears in the centre the Royal arms. Below the centre engraving is the following inscription:— ‘ To His Excellency Sir John Madden, K.C.M.G., from the
Duke of York, in remembrance of his visit to Melbourne, 1901. "— MELB. ARGUS.

One Smith holds forth :
Recent Bulletin story (8., 11/5/1), “The Man, reca s
an unpleasant dilemma. Introduced by a friend of mine
to his betrothed, I recognised her as a former acquain -
ance of my giddy days and riotous bounding nights.
She had never been a full member of the most ancient o
all professions, but had belonged to the legion that takes
presents and has a past. She asked me by letter oca
on her, and begged me not to give her away, as she had
kept square ever since meeting my friend, and always
meant to do so. She appeared quite sincere and in great
distress, so I-asked for time. Finally, after taking one
consideration with another, I could not see that it was
mv funeral any way, so I promised. It is a very nice
poU and should be argued before a full court of! experts
and old cats. As to the story, I think the int ® rfe
person who broke his neck to tell was a cad Without
the signature one would guess the writer to be a woman.
Women’s heroes are generally awful bounders when they
are not prigs.
Wellington (M.L.) City Council has fallen
into a stupendous orifice. Sometime since it
decided to acquire certain private lands for street-
widening purposes. In due course the land-
holders put in their claims—excessive as usual.
But the town clerk forgot to file the statutory
objection within the prescribed 60 days, and the
Courts have now decided that they have no power
to interfere. On present appearances the town
will have to pay £25,000 for £lO,OOO worth of land.
No doubt there is a way out if it can only be
found There are old moss-grown English laws
which people have forgotten to repeal that
will do almost anything, and if fcl '? n l£ l V ilk
only be found in time it is probable that the Lity
Council could take the land and refuse to pay a
pennv, and could order the land-owners to be
dragged to death by wild omnibuses as well. But
it is hard to find the right mouldy statute at the
right moment.

London Daily Mail’s description of the
magnificent style in which the millionaire-
bankrupt Hooley is living—said to be at the
rate of £50,000 a year—while his creditors
get 2s. in the £, is a nasty slap at the boasted
stringency of English legislation. Of course
Hooley is now merely his wifes agent, and
Hooleyism goes on as strong as ever. Bunch
hits the case off thus :
THE SPLENDID BANKRUPT.
Under its spreading bankruptcy
The village mansion stands ;
Its lord, a mighty man is he,
With large, broad-acred lands ;
And the laws that baulk his creditors
Are strong as iron bands.
His laugh is free and loud and long,
His dress is spick-and-span ;
He pays no debt With honest sweat,
He keeps whate’er he can,
And stares the whole world in the face,
For he fears not any man.
Week in, week out, from morn till night,
Prince-like he runs the show ;
And a round of social gaieties
Keeps things from getting slow—
As the agent of his wife, of course
His credit’s never low.”

A deputation of Victorian traders, giving
Cp-Operative Coupons, waited on Mr. Peacock in
support of the system. The deputation (to quote
the Akgus) was large enough to represent the
Continent ; and the various speakers were eloquent
regarding the benefits they had received from
issuing coupons. They stated that the public
were unanimous in favor of coupons, and it was
only a small section of traders who were hostile.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
Of the last Parkes Administration four
members have found their way into the Federal
ParliamentM'Millan, Gould, Bruce Smith, and
I umpkin ditto. The others did not seek election.
Sure signs of the coming N.S.W. State
election:
Mr. Mahon.v, M.L.A. for Annandale, and Mr. Horae,
member for the Glebe, have each obtained from the State
Chief Secretary’s Department a promise of 20 pairs of
blankets for the poor of their respective districts.
“Mr. Reid drew attention to the vague-
ness of the Ministerial declarations on the Queens-
land Kanaka labor question.”— Daily papev repovt.
Reid ! Reid! ! Wasn’t there a vague man of that
name who was going North in April (and didn’t
go) to decide whether he would be pro-Kanaka or
anti-Kanaka ?
Sydney Daily Telegraph in a fine frenzy :
Labour members must be compelled to choose their
side in Commonwealth politics like other members, and
be content with the influence to which their numbers
legitimately entitle them.
Well, they have chosen their side. There are
three sides, and theirs is one of them. Did the
fELEGRAPH never hear of a triangle V
Asa mark of respect to dear old partisan
Parkes, why did nobody propose J. H. Young
for leadership of N.S.W. Freetrade party. Young
was Parkes’s ideal Freetrader. That is, he was
mostly Protectionist, and where ham and butter
were concerned he was ultra-protectionist. But
seemingly Potato Young wasn’t considered Pro-
tectionist enough to lead the Freetrade party.
N.S.W. old Freetrade party, which, when
in hoffis, always said it couldn’t afford Free
Education, the money being wanted to pay for
free postage for the Herald and News and Tele-
graph, is starting to demand that the See Gov-
ernment be thrown out for not giving Free
Education. Of course, if the See Government
had promised to give it the demand would be that
it should be thrown out for “committing the
country to reckless expenditure.”
Did this cable really appear in the dailies
of 18th May, or is it a dream ?
ThcCapc University has provided facilities for prisoners
at bt. Helena to pass their examinations.
AiM the hog-like ignorance of these uncouth Boer
ruffians was the theme of every Jingo paper only
18 months ago ! At that time, they were sup-
posed not to be able to read large capitals, or to
recognise soap when they saw it.
Significant cablegram :
London, May 16.—Commandant Fourie, who was for
some time one of the most active of the Boer leaders
lias fallen under the suspicion of his followers. Thev
suspect that he is desirous of surrendering, and have im-
prisoned him on his own farm.
How does that chip in with the stories of Boer
commanders cruelly driving their men into battle
with sjambocks? In this case it looks like the
men driving their commander into battle.
Sydney Telegraph, in its anxiety to
secure the Labor vote for the cause of the British
and German importing firms, lately implored
the N.S.W. Laborists to remember that every-
thing they have gained has been through their
association with the Calico Jimmy crowd. Let’s
see ! They got One-Man-One-Vote from Dibbs.
They got Early-Closing and Old Age Pensions
and the 7s. a day minimum wage from Lyne and
Co. And Reid gave them a rail-painting job.
If the Federal Government would start its
researches after a Federal capital by passing an
Act to the effect that all private lands within the
Federal territory shall be resumed at
the present N.S. W. land-tax valuation
with not over 10 per cent, added for
disturbance, there would almost cer-
tainly be a painful silence among
some of the loud Orange-Canoblas
barrackers. It is generally under-
stood that when the Government buys
land it should pay twice or three
times its fair value. If the Federal
Government makes it dead certain
that it is only going to pay a fair value, certain
fersons who are enthusiastically marking out a
'ederal capital (in the public interest, of course)
right on or alongside their property, will get into a
much calmer frame of mind.
George Leake takes office as Premier of
Westralia, and so the old Forrest gang goes out
of power, after a glorious financial drunk of 11
years. Illingworth is Treasurer; Xingsmill,
Minister for Works ; Sommers and Gregory take
the Lands and Mines Department; and Richard
Speight, Victorian railway commissioner of the
boom-time and hero of the stupendous libel suit of
Space versus Time, was a kind of temporary
Minister of Railways for two days, and then
gave place to Holmes.
The strike of the Sydney Ferries’ Co.
employes—doubly inconvenient in view of the
natural increase of traffic over the York reception
—was ended in less than 48 hours by the conces-
sion of the men’s demands. The principal of these
was “ that 60 hours be allowed to constitute a
week s work, and additional hours be reckoned as
overtime. Surely a modest enough requirement;
and the ta,ct that the men had to go on strike to
procure the concession is strong evidence of the
= ty,m N.S.W., of a Board of Compulsory
State Premier See, who charges Opposition
.Leader Lee with socialism because the latter
genuinely or not, advocates State coal-mines to
supply the State railways, makes a sick exhibition
ot himself as a reasoner. State railways are as
much sodalistic as would be a State coal-mine to
teed the railways. In Prussia, where they are not
socialistic—only intensely business-like—the State
has lately been buying up mines so that it may
not be liable to have its coal cut off because some
tool ot a coal-owner quarrels with his employes
over 2d. or so, and starts a strike which may
spread all over the kingdom. J
Spite of Bigjohn’s boasted electoral con-
cessions to the goldfields, East Kimberley still
w S \ 07 ™ te , rs forone member, and Kalgoorlie4897 :
West Kimberley has 263, and Hannan’s 6577
Koebourne 286, and Kanowna 5930. And the few-
m,Rn ail( I many-bullock electorates are all places
where the Forrest crowd can rely on returning a
member of its own way of not thinking, while the
many-men constituencies are those where a Forrest
candidate hasn’t the ghost of a show. With equal
electorates, the tail-end of the Forrest party would
have come back from last election about three
strong.
Mooted among some of the See crowd to
start another Unemployed Advisory Board to
assist the Labor Bureau. Such boards are abso-
lute shams, organised wholly in the interests of
political hangers-on. The unemployed get no-
thing, and are not meant to get anything, out of
them, field’s Advisory Board of a few years ago
cost a good deal in advice, and the value of it was
about ml. Of course, such boards don’t ask pay-
ment at the start. The office is purely honorary,
it is said. But notice how the Premier who
starts the business rounds up his favorite dead-
beats. Then, some evening, you observe a few
hundreds on the Estimates.
Mauger, of Victoria, remarked the other
day in the Federal House of Heps, that Protec-
tion had helped his State through the 1893 crisis
and its results. Whereupon Joe Cook said
proudly that N.S.W. got through all right with-
out Protection. Being told that N.S.W. got
through by extra borrowing Joe Cook got mad
and denied the statement point blank. The
Foreign-trader’s capacity for denying the most
obvious - facts when they don’t square with his
theory is calculated to bring a blush up behind
the ears of Ananias. The great bank crisis took
place early in ’93, and under Protection N.S.W.
pulled through till the beginning of 1896. When
it abandoned Dibbs’s Protective tariff it pulled
through by larger and larger loan expenditure
every year. (£1,270,000 in 1896; £1,477,000 in
.97 ; £1,644,000 m '98; £2,032,000 in ’99; £2,211,000
m 1900 ; £2,287,000 in the 10 months to 30th April,
1.101) These are Statistician Coghlan’s figures,
and the most frantic denials of Holy Joe Cook
won t shift them. These denials only serve to
inspire a grievous doubt about local-preacher
Cook's reliability.
THE PITT STREET DECORATIONS—THE
APOTHEOSIS OF THE POP-SHOP.
Victoria is the beginning and end of the
Federal Ministry” howled Reid the other night
to the House of Representatives. Victoria in
proportion to its population, has less representa-
tion m the Federal Ministry than any other State
but that sufficiently obvious fact makes no
difference in the blatant howl of the Foreign-trade
tarradiddler.
There should be rorfcy times in the Fed.
Parliament if King O’Malley’s proposal anent
the opening prayer is carried. The Tasmanian
democrat objects to the supplication being read
by a common layman, and wants a chaplain—
‘one for a session or a regular roster.” Cer-
tainly, let ’em all come ! Say Bishop Goe on
Tuesday, Dr. Carr on Wednesday, Commandant
Booth on Thursday, then Dr. Bevan, Rev. Smith,
hev. Brown, and so on.
A FAIR GUESS.
VISITOR : "What is the height of that arch , my
man? ”
COMMON PERSON : “It’s the height of folly and
extravagance.”
“ The heart of the Irish soldier beats as
true beneath his tunic as the Highlander’s heart
under his kilt ! Flavin, M.P. for Kerry in
British House of Commons.
King Edward VII. should be credited
with an initial deed of courage and straightfor-
wardness. Almost his first act, on ascending the
throne, was to pronounce for a White Britain
by sacking the Oriental niggers who had been
making the Royal presence all too smellful during
Victoria’s latter days.
Westralia’s imports for 1900 were worth
£33 11s. per inhabitant; exports, £3B 12s. per in-
habitant. The difference is £5 per inhabitant, or
£25 a year (nearly 10s. a week) for a family of five
ill at represents money or goods sent away to pay
interest on foreign debts, and if it wasn’t that
W estralia still pays much of its interest by fresh
borrowings, the surplus of exports would be twice
as Hrge. It will be more than twice as large some
day. The “ influx of foreign capital for the de-
velopment of our great natural resources ” is a
ruinous thing. We get the development, and the
foreign pawnbroker gets the resources.
S.A. Tories tried hard to induce new State
Premier Jenkins to coalesce with them and thus
crush the Labor Party, but Jenkins remained true
to his supporters and appointed two faithful
Liberals m Butler and Brooker. The Laborites
supported Kingston for seven solid years, and
Holder after him, and they intend to support
Jenkins if he is the kind of Jenkins that is ex-
pected. And, looking at the thing as a matter of
mere policy, it would have been absurdly foolish
of Jenkins to exchange that reliable support for
the unstable vote of Bill Copley and the greasy
right hand of fellowship held out by Robert
Horn burg and the Stomach Party generally.
While all the great Freetrade bosses of
JNew South Wales were telling the Federal Parlia-
ment how Protection reduces wages while Free-
trade makes the worker Jolly and Fat, N.S.W
experienced the largest strike it had seen for a
f/ri’ m £v liy , d i l ; ya ' , The employes of the great
Mort s Dock Go. dropped their tools by way of
enforcing a demand that their scanty Freetrade
wage should be raised to the figure paid in Protec-
tiqmst Victoria. The difference between the two
rates was, m some cases, as much as 12s. per week
It will take weeks of whirling Freetrade eloquence
to explain away this unpleasant matter. Men
don t strike for reduced wages unless they have
been drinking a good deal.
Britain has
added 6d in the
£ to its income-
tax in two years
as the result of
the S’African
war, raising the
tax from 8d. to
14d. in the £.
Apropos of

ton (Tas.) Exa-
miner demands
to know why
this country
doesn’t shoulder
its pi'oportion of
the £160,000,000
or so of the
British warbill.
The idea has
something to re-
commend it. In-
come-tax falls,
to a great ex-
tent, on a vio-
lently Jingo-
section of the
community, and
the spectacle of
that section
backingitsopin-
ion to the ex-
tent of 8d. in the
£ extra income-tax would
be touching. So far, no
Australian Treasurer has dared
to ask it for even an extra Id. in the
Q .,, ...» t0 , cover this country’s own little bill,
baid bill has been shirked in various ways. N.S W
es it by temporary overdraft at the Bank of
JN.b. W. The war ex’s, plague ex’s, and Federal
celebration bills (oyer £400,000 up to date, all
told) are charged neither to ordinary expenditure
to loans, nor to deficit. In fact, they aren’t
charged anywhere—just temporarily shirked.
Ihe S.A. lories have spent more money
over the elections to be decided this Satur-
day than they have parted with for years. Dixon
lory nominee and advocate of the Snow private
syndicate tramway grab, is pouring out coin as if
it was inferior colonial beer in the effort to keep,
out Proud, who advocates State control. Mean-
while the Jenkins Government makes its first
great mistake by not declaring for State tramway
ownership. The dead silence of the Jenkins-
Government on this subject is a severe disappoint-
ment. When a man afflicts the page of history
with a name like Jenkins he is expected to do*
something handsome for his species, if only to
make up for being Jenkins.
The conduct of Tasmanian Premier Lewis
in accepting a C.M.G. has called forth much ob-
jurgation among politicians. Douglas and Dick-
son, both of Queensland, were the only other
1 rentiers in the Commonwealth who wore that
cheap degradation, and even they had it before
they reached the Premiership. Lewis is the first
man in these States who, while head of the
Government, accepted the meanest farthing
bauble that the British Government had to give,
and by so doing he has lowered the price of Pre-
miers and made a slump in the market. If there
are many more like Lewis, the time will come
when Britain will offer Australian Premiers a
J.P.-ship apiece, or offer to make them church-
wardens.
An Imperialistic notion gaining favor with
a superfluous class of Australian politicians is that
Australian Premiers, and such like, shall be made
eligible for Imperial appointments, say as
Governors of outlying dependencies. If this-
comes to pass, the next stage of Australia will be
worse than the last. The Australian Premier
who sells his country for a title is common enough,
yet a title is only an unsalaried gaud after all.
When there are also in view prospects of power,
a big salary—probably for life, promotion, a pension
in the far distance, the chance of being a lord, and
the certainty of being an Excellency—well, Aus-
tralia will have to put up its Premier’s screw to
£10 000 a-year, and make it more profitable to-
stick to Australia than to sell it. Zt is best
to get men who can’t be bought, but they are
scarce The next best thing is to bid higher than
the other fellow.
George Reid’s trump card in the first
Federal Parliament debate was interstate
jealousies. He is going to create trouble between
the various States at the very outset, if it is
possible to do so. A very special effort was made
all through his angry oration to stir up bitter
hostility between New South Wales and Victoria.
In a two hours’ speech he never uttered a national
sentiment. Petty displays of spleen and dis-
appointment were constantly to the fore. He
even went so far as to complain savagely of the
Peacock Government because its members had
not called on him and grovelled at his bumptious
feet during his stay in Victoria, and because he
had not been treated as a sufficiently extra-dis-
tmgushed guest during the celebrations. It was
the speech of a bitterly mortified music-hall
entertainer of the sixpenny order with a tendency
to drop to threepence—and it was a failure.

Maoriland is augry about some railway
passenger-cars, tly imported at a higli price
from America. 'ine islanders had expected to
receive something extra special, but, when the.
cars arrived, it was found that they were inferior
in workmanship and finish to, and more expensive
than, the ordinary every-day railway-car turned
out by Maoriland’s own mechanics in the
Addington (Christchurch) railway shops. There
are few things the people of this country
can’t make as well as the foreigner, if they only
knew it, but they seem to know it with great
difficulty.

Mr. S. A. PALMER.
Dear Sir,—Before last Christmas I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me in a very weak condition. I
was weak, no appetite, and troubled with Diarrhoea. I
tried various remedies, but the result was not satisfactory.
I could not work as I wanted to, my strength failing me,
and my body feeling worn out. I continued in this state
until the end of February, when I was recommended to
try WEBBER’S VITADATIO. After taking a few bottles
I felt like a new man. All my strength and energy re-
turned, and I have been able to do my work, which con-
sists of splitting wood, and is, therefore, of a very hard
nature, with ease and satisfaction. Considering lam just
upon sixty years of age, I consider the result of taking
Vitadatio in my case to be splendid, and you are welcome
to mention my case to anyone. I work at Miller’s Timber
Yards, Glene'lg, where I have been working the last
twenty years.—l am, yours truly,

Everyone has heard of the man who was
ruined through drink ; it is time the man who
was saved through .drink had a show,
years ago a Sydney merchant struck a great finan-
cial snag at a very snaggy period of N.S. W.
tory. If he could get a little time to meet urgent
present liabilities, without asking for it and
thereby damaging his future credit, he reckoned
he might just crawl through; and drink saved
him. He came down one morning and told his
head clerk that his parents had both died m Eng-
land—which was strictly true, for they had been
dead many years—and that the shock was terrible.
Then he downed his grief in drink (not very
much drink, but enough to help him to cultivate
a hiccup and affect to be drunker than he was).
For ten days it was impossible to make him under-
stand that he should sign a cheque ; and mean-
time his clerk explained frankly that it wasn t
want of money but plain drunk that made it im-
possible to meet immediate liabilities. Also, lest
sober merchants should fear to do business
in future, it was explained on all hands that
the boss had never been that way before, and as
his parents couldn’t die a second time, there was
no probability that he would be that way again.
A certain amount of sympathy was even worked
up for him as a man of unusually deep affections.
When money enough had been gathered in to
meet the most urgent liabilities the old man
sobered up and wore crape on his belltopper. His
parents continue dead.
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
pre-s your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps y ur knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILE. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

Half the fun of life is
lost by many people
through their neglect
of Nature’s most rigid
laws. Nature insists
on regularity. People
who allow the continu-
ance of any irregularity
in their digestiveorgans
soon have to pay the
penalty. Free and re-
gular movement of the
bowels is the surest sign
of good health. The
first question the doctor
asks is, “ Are your
bowels regular ? ” If
not, he gives something
to make them so, and
quite often that is all
he needs to do. Assist
Nature occasionally in
removing offending
matter from the stom-
ach and bowels. What
is needed is a gentle but efficient helper that
works like Nature. That helper is Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. They are entirely vegetable,
being composed of pure roots and herbs.
They cleanse the stomach, make the appetite
healthy, the digestion perfect, the liver active,
and the blood pure. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills cure when other remedies fail. They
positively cure Biliousness, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, Dyspepsia, Headaches, Liver and Kidney
Diseases, Boils, Pimples and Blotches, and are a
perfect blood purifier. For female ailments they
stand alone as a woman’s best friend. Dr.

Melb. Hkrald, in gushing .over the de-
parture of Duke of York, wrote of railway
arrangements, as follows: “The Royal train ar-
rived at Flinders-street at 12.22 p.m., and left
again. at 12.16 p.m., a pretty smart piece of work
reflecting the utmost credit on the station masters
concerned.” Rather !
Anthony Forrest, son of Alex. Forrest
and nephew of ex-Premier Bigjohn, whose pro-
motion, at the age of about 17, to be a boy-
lieutenant in the Westralian contingent to Africa
roused so much animosity, was killed there almost
immediately on arrival. He is generally supposed
to have been the youngest officer who fell on the
British side all through the war.
The Royal tour has been everywhere
marked by perfect concord and harmony, the re-
sult, in a great measure, of D.C.L. whiskey.
With scarcely an exception, the organisers of the
festivities have been unswerving in their loyalty
to the brand aforesaid, consequently they were
enabled to get through the maximum amount of
work with, the minimum of fatigue and worry.
D.C.L. quickens the brain without swelling the
head, and has well earned its title of the whiskey
of the wise.*
The last days of George Throssell’s brief
Ministry in Westralia were full of woe. His
predecessor, Forrest, wrote violent letters, deny-
ing the truth of Throssell’s statements about the
condition of the finances. There was trouble
about the legal status of the new Ministers he
appointed, when he took office. The general elec-
tion knocked his party into a cocked hat, and half
his Ministry couldn’t even get a seat. Then it
was discovered—or the lawyers reckoned it was—
that Throssell’s own appointment as Premier was
informal—in fact, that the formal appointment
had been quite overlooked —and he wasn’t legally
Premier at all, and his Ministry didn’t exist, and
never had existed. This was the last straw, and
the Throssell Cabinet passed in its resignation
after a stormy existence of 3£ months.
The Yorks’ visit has revealed to observant
Australians how little value Britain gives for this
country’s naval subsidy. The Juno and the St.
George are smaller than the Royal Arthur, and
are supposed to be of only the same speed (all
three are credited with knots) yet they made
a hack of her in fast cruising, the Juno especially
leaving her all standing, in their race across the
Bight. In Hobson’s Bay, however, the Russian
cruiser Gromoboi and the Yankee Brooklyn
showed themselves as far superior to the Juno as
she was to the craft of the Australian station.
This was a tactical blunder on the part of the Im-
perial authorities. The very pick of the British
navy should have been sent out; then no awkward
comparisons could have been made.
Patrick Perkins—the “ Jonah ” Perkins
of other days—died through a chill caught at the
opening of the Federal Parliament. Curious
that the only two men whose deaths appear
to have been indirectly hastened by Federa-
tion Dickson and Perkins both came from
the North. Perkins was born in Tipperary
(Ireland) 62 years ago, and was for many
years a prosperous Queensland brewer and a
very moderate Queensland politician. M ‘llwraith
made him Minister for Lands in 1879, and he held
the billet till ’B3. Perkins probably got ashore
alive from more wrecked ships than any other
man in Australia who didn’t follow the sea as a
profession in fact legend has it that any ordinary
captain would give the coast a ten-miles wider
berth than usual when he learned that Perkins
was on board.
The Duke of York was guarded in Mel-
bourne by some 40 detectives. This is Sydney
Truth’s account of the zealous “demons” at the
St. Paul’s Cathedral service, attended by the
Duke and Duchess:
These royal shadows watched bishops, canons and
deans, and the ordinary variety of vicars and curates.
They watched the choir, and searched the pipes of the
organ. Every prayerful man and woman, every maiden
and youth, were all under their gaze, and, when Ward
and Macmanamy’s round “Amen” rolled through the
edifice, it was repeated again with precision by the other
detectives in the Cathedral, just as the words u All’s
well sound in the night through Darlinghurst gaol
after the clock has chimed the hour.

Turf Club Handicap—the principal event of the S.T.O.

opener to the know-alls, outside the “ stable ” and its

him as not worth thinking about at any distance beyond
a mile. Hence his party (including the same people who
brought Merloolas to Sydney, and engineered Loch Clieve-

“fJA between Palmer (Melbourne) and Moloney (New-

° ,? ame bufc pugilism were concerned. Palmer
couldn t or wouldn’t fight, and Moloney would but
couldnt. By-and-bye, after Palmer had jigged about
the ring asi far away from Moloney as the ropes would let
him, and Moloney had indulged in sundry pantomimic
rushes, sprawls, and slashes at the unoffending atmo-
sphere, Palmer lay down in the fourth round. Whereat
a section of the crowd screeched “ foul,” while more
yelled sundry something-elses, mainly consisting of com-
Fki n fi en k? ry nar k s regarding the management, the club,
the fighters (?) and) the officials. The “ barney ” was sus-
tained for some time ; meanwhile the “langwidge” the
strange cries from the throats of the howlers, and the
steaming atmosphere got in their deadly work, and one
had to stand it all as best one might, for getting out into
the street was an impossibility until the mass of hot
swearing, disappointed man thinned a bit. The means
of exit is only one way, and that through a narrow door
and a long passage.

“Bee”: A short time back went to an old
bruiser for instruction in the noble art at half-a-crown a
lesson, as per advertisement. Several turned up, and the
first lesson was something like this “ Before we start
graft, said the pug., “ I’ll give you some advice. Don’t
you young chaps think you’re cornin’ ’ere to learn to bash
and scrap, so that you can go round lookin’ for fight
becos that s not the thing. I’ll tell you what is the
thing. S posm you’re in a bar and a man insultsyou-
you feel like waltzin’ right through ’im just becos you

urt that man or ’e may ’urt you ; that’s nothin’, but
think of the other people you may ’urt as well. ’E may
have a wife or a mother” (here a long dissertation on the
value of these problematical ladies), “and you may de-
pnve them of their sole prop and mainstay, so, I say
don t it that man. But if a man ’its you, that’s when :

Murkan writers say that Bob Fitzsimmons
purposes coming home to Australia for a while, ere long
but this scribe doesn’t credit it. He knows the lanky
bruiser too well to think that he’ll leave the prospect of
P dl "eup a few dollars just to satisfy sentiment, and
there dbe nothing else in it. Fitz. could make very little
money here, though he is an “actor” and said to be
much the best of all the pugs who have taken to the
game. Mention of sentiment reminds that there’s little
of this commodity in Bob’s make-up. He is a plain,
matter-of-fact, cool, calculating customer, just as hard-
fisted out of the ring as in it, hence he is in a position
to withdraw altogether from the bruising biz. and live in
Easy-street for the rest of his days.

Doc ” : Why not schoolboy boxing champion-
ships in Australia as at ’Ome ? At Aldershot Hall (Eng.),

taint of undesirable associations. Writer commends the

Ancient : Yankee middleweight, Jack
O’Brien, has challenged present champion of England,
George Chrisp, who is also a middleweight; but George
isn’t taking any. Whereat ’Ome scribes bewail the low
condition to which the standard of British pugilism has
been reduced. Once a dozen champions could be found in
England at any weight, who’d close with offers from any-
where, and think it good luck to get them. This was in
the days when masters at the business like Nat Langham
kept “sporting drums” and always had a few front-
rankers on hand to spar for the “showers” from their
patrons.

Dear Bulletin.—Your issue of May 4, under
the heading of “ Sporting Notions,” states that Frank
Lelen, the enthusiastic gambler, died in London the
other week, aged 71. This is incorrect. He died on
May 5, 1888. He was my cousin. Mr. Frank Lelen, my
brother, who died 24th Feb. this year, was not a gambler,
and the paragraph referred to has caused me much
annoyance, and it will hurt the feelings of his family.
After 60 years strict attention to his business—that of a
nsh salesman—he died at the age of 73, honored and re-
spected by all who knew him. I believe your correspon-
dent is pretty correct with regard to my cousin, Frank
Lelen. — F. M. Lelen, Oharlton-street, Exeter, Sema-

Third round of Sydney senior-grade Rugby was
decided Saturday. ’Varsity-Glebe match drew6ooo. Play
was close and brilliant right through. ’Varsity (with the
wind) in first half notched 9 points, but Glebe was atop
subsequently and made matters hot round ’Varsity posts
till “ time,” finishing with 6 points (two tries) to its
credit. The Glebe crowd had bad luck often, otherwise
they might have won. South settled North Sydney by 9
to 3, an advantage which Newtown got away with over
Balmain ; while Eastern put Western Suburbs down,
scoring 11 to 8. North Sydney and ’Varsity head the list
so far.

“Old Timer”: Proposal to hold a regatta at
Grafton (N.S.W.)on the King’s Birthday (Nov. 9) con jures
up memories of bitter struggles in that neighbourhood
over a quarter of a century back, when Ned Trickett,
Lias Laycock, Mick Rush, Donald M‘Donald, and Pros.
Ooulon figured among the contending scullers. Peculiar,
too, that all those rowing giants of the past (bar Trickett)
acquired their skill on the same river (the Clarence),
which developed Harr}’ Searle. Mick Rush’s early sculling
was done in a butcher’s boat. Pros. Coulon would un-
doubtedly have proved master of them all had he lived ;
he was a splendidly-built, powerful fellow, with every-
thing physically that a champion needed, and a heart as
big as a cathedral. Rush and he often rowed double
sculls, and won a few good races together. The hand-
some,good-natured Irishman many a time said in present
scribe’s presence that Pros, would certainly have reached
the top rung had the opportunity been available. Ooulon
succumbed to swamp fever 27 or 28 years since.

Sculler Towns has been heard from per latest
mail. He almost despairs of ever hitching on to Canuck
Gaudaur, whose latest move of evasion, after expressing
willingness for a meeting, was to take on ex-Yankee
amateur Rumohr for an alleged bet of £2OO a-side. Towns
also deplores the fact that, after having won the Sports-
man Cup twice, and with every prospect of being able to
maintain his right to the trophy should opportunity offer,
it will slip from him, as conditions exact that the emblem
must be won thrice in two years before becoming 1 the
absolute property of anyone, and September next 'Cvill see
the end of that term. Small wonder that Towns seems
br ° k £ tl ci U Sr and alks of . comin £ home to the Hunter River
and N.S. vV. again. Pity there isn’t some international
association to control world’s championships, and see that
the right thing is done by making the holder of a title
enter the lists once within a given time, or lose bv de-
fault. J

“K.”: Further proof of assertion (Bulletin
par that lines upon which the Oxford eight’s
winning boat of this year was constructed were borrowed
from Sydney builder Neilsen’s ideas is supplied in late
Ome files. It is stated therein that a Cantab College has
ordered from English builder Olasper an eight in accord
with a design supplied by M.L. sculler Sullivan. The
feature about these short boats is that they are
very much more buoyant, and consequently not near so
great a tax upon strength as are the old-fashioned con-
trivances. Single sculling boats, fours, and eights turned
out on the same principle have proved much superior to
the original comparatively-deep-sunken craft.

It was in the early days of bicycles—front
wheels sft. high. A scorcher whizzed past an old Irish-
woman and her daughter on a country road. The old
lady—who was only able to see obliquely from one eye-
clung in a dazed manner to the fence with one hand
while she rapidly made the sign of the cross with the
other. “ Kathleen,” she said solemnly ; “ didn’t you see
Anti-Christ go by with a man on his back ? ”
The Procession.
With shriek of fifes, and bang of drums,
Behold the Royal Circus comes.
The quiet air is rent and torn
With voice of bagpipe and of horn.
The banners flutter in the breeze,
From windows and from balconies;
As if each house, with joyful shout,
Had hung its gaudiest washing out. ■
The Generals and Colonels ride
Like Star Performers, full of pride.
And feathers shade each martial face—
Enough to stuff a pillow-case.
The troops pass by—a stream of steel—
A proud sight for the Commonweal.
The people crush and crowd to see
This Royal Circus fine—and free—
That rolls along, with flags unfurled,
And all the madness of the world.
The bands play louder still, and lo
He comes, the Centre of the Show !
Who was it said, with cynic sneer,
“ A Prince should ne’er be seen too near ? ”
He meant, whoever used the phrase,
A Prince of these degenerate days.
Princes of old had brawn and bone
To wade through slaughter to a throne.
’Tis well for York, in many ways,
That he was born in later days.
He scarce could, at his best, do more
Than wade through half-a-pint of gore.
The martial music dies away ;
The day becomes a common day.
The plumed and brass-bound chieftains ride
Into Oblivion, side by side.
Alas ! I fear this wondrous Show
Gave Loyalty a fatal blow.
If not, then Wirth should deprecate
The competition of the State.

taking this medicine till it is all used up. Then
come back and let me have a look at you.”
This was in December, 1896. The woman put
the package in her pocket and went home. When
the stuff had been consumed, as directed, she
called again.
The specialist looked at her and made up his
mind in a minute, “I will have nothing to do
with you as a patient,” he said. “ It’s no use.
You are past help ; you are worse than when you
were here before; I can see the bones th rough
your skin now. What I tell is the truth, and
you will be wise not to deceive yourself with hopes
that can only break down under you.”
Rather hard, ugly talk ; but from a common-
sense point of view the doctor was right. For
four years Mrs. Agnes Briggs, of Norwood
Terrace, Paddington, near Brisbane, Queensland,
had suffered what she calls “dreadful torment
and pain” from dysentery. She tried everything
advertised or recommended to cure it, without
success.
She was an out-patient at the hospital for more
than a twelvemonth, and an in-patient for two
months. The medical men interested themselves
in the case; they tried right and left for the true
treatment, but were not able to lay hands on it.
This seemed strange to her, as she did not realise
how persistent, and frequently fatal, an ailment
dysentery is. She had never read the reports of
Army Surgeons on that point, and- possibly you
have not.
“During my illness,” says Mrs. Briggs, “I ate
but little ; food did not nourish me, and I grew
worse and worse, and thinner and thinner. For
three years I did a trifle of work, and then I had
to give in.” .
(At this crisis she consulted the specialist,
whose frank opinion has been quoted.)
“From January to October, 1897,” continues
the lady, “ I could do nothing whatever. Even
my children were cared for by friends. My
mother did all the housework, and, on seeing me,
she often burst out crying. I was so emaciated
and weak, she was sure I must die soon.
“ And now comes my extraordinary cure—a cure
so wonderful and unexpected that my friends
insisted on calling it a miracle.
“ A lady urged me to drop all other medicines
and use Mother Seigel’s Syrup only. Before
finishing the first bottle I was better, and after
taking it three months I was in splendid health,
and have been ever since. People can hardly
believe that the strong, healthy woman they see
now is identical with the skeleton they knew and
pitied two years ago.”
Mrs. Agnes Briggs, Sept. 21st, 1899.
Mrs. Annie Mathams, of Prince-street, Latrobe
Terrace, Paddington, Brisbane, Queensland, who
commended the Syrup to Mrs. Briggs, vouches,
in writing, to the truth of the above statement.*

There seems to be a great deal of miscon-
ception among cyclists as to the proper degree of
hardness to which Dunlop lyres should be
pumped. Many riders are disposed to ride them
too slack, and when so ridden the tendency for
the tyres to slip on greasy roads is much greater
than when they are pumped hard ; they are also
more liable to puncture, and to wear out much
quicker. Cyclists will find that “ Dunlops wear
much longer, puncture less, and run easier when
pumped that hard that there is only a slight de-
pression in the tyre when the weight of the rider
is on the machine. The heavier the cyclist, the
harder tyres want pumping.*

At Poverty Point.
Mr. Harry Stockdale has on view at 42 Norwich
Chambers, Hunter-street, Sydney, his unique and com-
prehensive collection of Australian aboriginal weapons,
ornaments, implements, and utensils. Every part of the
continent is well represented, and some of the specimens
are, from their extreme rarity, almost priceless. Apart
from its ethnological interest, the collection forms a useful
object-lesson to anybody who undervalues the skill and
ingenuity of the race we have supplanted in Australia.
To the average Australia: 1 . —accustomed to sprays of
badly-painted flowers conventionally arranged, and two
little views in opposite corners of the sheet Blamire
Young’s illuminated address, presented by the music-
lovers of Melbourne to George Musgrove, came as a
revelation. Addresses of this sort are usually tawdry ana
common ; but Young’s illuminated address is a work of
art. It is in book form, double leaved, and the text m
beautiful missal-like characters. Along the top of the
first page storm-fiends are beating back Vanderdecken s
ship in a daring green sea. The Flying Dutchman him-
self is contemplating his past at one side, and along the
bottom is the cottage interior in Wagner s opera. The
second page is devoted to Tannhauser, and the artist has
drawn a wonderful forest as a background for his display
of the loves of the hero and Venus.
Soprano Ella Russell was very enthusiastic after a visit
to Marshall Hall’s Oonservatorium the other day. She
was particularly enthusiastic about Marguerite Hender-
son, one of Hall’s best pupils. When such voice and such
talent can be trained locally, Ella Russell wondered that
English singers should be so generally imported.
Peterson’s first students’ concert showed a pronounced
falling off from the concerts of Marshall Hall. The new
professor has no trace of genius, but his “ soiree was as
chaste as a young ladies’ boarding-school. Peterson is
milk and water ; Hall, rum and milk.
The Brisbane debfit of the young Queensland violiniste,
Flora Mackay, was a solid triumph, also a feather in the
cap of her early teacher, Rosendorff, who, recognising he
had an uncut diamond, persuaded her parents to send her
to the foremost teachers of the Old World.
The pit, at Melb. Majesty’s, found a local allusion in
the ‘ ‘ Royal Divorce,” where Stephanie said to Augereau,
“You spread your tail like a Peacock.”
Worthy Dr. Neild came from his retirement to cackle a
little at the shivoo for the opening of Rickards’ Melb.
Opera-house. The G.O.M, (Good Old Medico) counted up
how he had assisted at the baptism of the Royal and Iron
Pot in 1855, and since at all the playhouses.
“ Melb.” : Mrs. Sandes (Graham Berry’s daughter) sailed
upon the stage as Marie Louise in a “ Royal Divorce
with a refreshing apartness from the rest of the troupe.
They all seemed jaded. She was fresh as strawberries
and cream. Yet, of course, there could be hardly any
technique. But there was some degree of charm. I was
thinking of the father in a debate ; he always had a
feminine way.
“ H.” : The prophecy made by the fortune-telling
woman in Martinique to Josephine is referred to in “A
Royal Divorce.” This is not one of the historic mock
pearls, fudged up after the event. Sir Walter Scott and
Sir A. Alison have both left their testimony that they
heard of the prophecy before Napoleon became First
Consul. It was that Josephine would become a Queen,
and be dethroned. When she was a prisoner in the Con-
ciergerie, a myrmidon of the Revolutionary Tribunal
folded up her bed, saying “You won’t want this any
more.” She replied, “ You lie, man ; I’m to be a Queen.
“ Melb.": In disparaging the present “ Royal Divorce,”
one may forget the advantage of the former co. in the
gloss and bloom of a new thing. Life has no second
spring. So with a play not of the first-class. Of course,
one expects a “Macbeth” to be galvanised. “Royal
Divorce ” comes as a fish so long out of water as to be
hardly even damp, and it is flabby. Yet I looked for
better acting, and had to say that almost all was below
the Knight-Ferrar standard. Cecil Ward, Oathcart, and
Harwood, are the most useful men ever I saw, but
Cecil is here only utility. Knight had a Dr. Rentoul
tang of voice which helped to impose on one with a
Napoleonic personality. Miss Raymond is a comedienne.
She quite failed to convince as Josephine. Nor was
Plimmer, in Augereau, anything like so good as Carvill.
Trebelli Dolores sings at each of her recitals an air
from one or other of the operas that will presently be
performed by the new Italian co. An interesting treat
for musical people who intend to hear these operas in
due course, but rather rough on the artists who will be
criticised by comparison with the rare virtues of the
Franco-Italian prima-donna. Dolores is singing better
than ever. She cultivates her voice assiduously. “One
must continue to improve until the voice has passed its
prime,” says the adorable little woman, “ for if one takes
things easy the things become more difficult,” or words
to that effect. And how much greater is a versatile
Dolores in her art of taking pains than was, say, the late
Sims Reeves, who for many years confined himself to the
rendering of “ My Pretty Jane.” “ Come into the Garden,
Maud,” and similar flimsy ballads.
Ada Reeve, who seems to have taken this second trip
to Australia for the benefit of her health, was unlucky in
being quarantined through a small-pox case aboard the
Ormuz. But quarantine is healthy, anyhow.
Jean Gerardy, the 23-year-old ’cellist, who is said to be
going to astonish Australia by his performances on the
big soulful fiddle, comes with the reputation of having
played a solo at the Crystal Palace to the piano accom-
paniment of Paderewski. “ A rare tribute from one great
artist to another,” as Gerardy’s advt. truly states. If
Gerardv were a Pole like Paderewski, it might be
imagined that the latter was only giving a lift to a dis-
cordant fellow-countryman, but the ’cello artist is a
Belgian. ...
“Melb.”: What a master of the stage Dampier is !
Nature denied him every requisite, apparently. His duck
walk I have heard absurdly traced to a fall from a horse
when he was a circus-rider. He has no presence, no eye ;
his countenance is inexpressive, his voice bad, his delivery
awkward. And yet how the mind triumphs over all, and
impresses its stamp on the audience. In the ‘ Power of
Wealth ” he makes an impossible play not only credible,
but convincing. Not another actor in Melbourne could
persuade you that a man can marry the same woman
twice, as two men.
“Fiddlesticks”: At Trebelli’s concert on Saturday
niffht (Melb.), a great audience listened, with more or less
passive approbation, to the first eight items on the pro-
mmme —songs and piano solos, very high-class, and all
with French or Italian titles. Then followed three
English ballads ; and for the first time the great audience
waS genuinely, spontaneously moved, and exacted the
first encore of the evening. So much for the cant and
humbug as to Melbourne’s hungering for the classics,
as expounded by Marshall Hall and Co. Decades ago,
Bulwer Lytton, in his “ Parisians,” exposed the cant as
to English audiences being sincere in their admiration
for the imported ii classic ”in music or song. It is just
as true to-day. The classic-taste in music is purely a
matter of affinity and blood, and is outside of intellectual
appreciation.
“Alex M.”: Went to Sydney Royal, t’other night,
specially to take in Lempriere Pringle’s Mephistopheles.
Was not disappointed. Best all-round rendering we ve
seen here. Voice more of cantante quality than profundo,
but nevertheless satisfactory in the lower notes, and,
with the exception of a slight “ shoutiness ” occasionally
in the upper regions, excellently produced all through.
Exceeded in power of tone only by big Enrico Dondi (of
the old Lyster days) and, perhaps, also by Edward
Farley. In dramatic intensity, however, Pringle is far
beyond Dondi; while, in production, intonation and
evenness, he has much the advantage of Farley.
As to acting, Dondi was decidedly “ sticky ;
Farley, better, but nothing to boast of; Buzzi, too
grimacious and twisty ; and Tilbury (a finished singer,
but slightly lacking resonance), too canny—as distin-
guished from uncanny. Pringle—though not my ideal
Mephisto (an ideal which I shall never see in this world)
—reads a good deal of himself into the part, and plays
the devil ” with it in a sense not usually associated with
that phrase. He sneers not at all (in the ludicrously
patent traditional manner), laughs artistically little, and
assumes—when the diablerie of the situation is specially
insistent—a monumental impassiveness of face and figure
that gave me the only really devilish effect I have ever
had from any Mephisto.
Barron Berthald, Musgrove’s soulful tenor, wrote a long
letter to Melb. Age just before quitting Victoria, to pro-
test against some cynical criticism upon Christian Science
and the good souls who run the thing in London. It
appears that 8.8. is a Christian Scientist of the deepest
dye, and believes that faith will move mountains, also
cataracts, boils and tumors. He has no confidence what-
ever in the mundane science of medical men. When
Berthald’s throat goes back on him he moves apart, and
sits down, and believes as hard as ever he can that his
throat is getting better, or that it has been well all the
time—and it has always got well eventually. There are
other advantages, coo. Christian Science never sends in
a bill.


What kind of a joke is the N.S. W. steel-
rail contract ? It is proposed that capitalists
be invited : (1) to put up iron works in N.S.W. ;
(2) to deposit £lO,OOO with the Government as a
proof of good faith ; (3) to work their men only
eight hours daily ; (4) to pay not less than 7s. per
day for the cheapest class of labor and trades-
union rates for skilled labor ; and (5) to supply
the Government with steel rails at not less than
the price at which English or American rails could
be delivered. On these conditions the Govern-
ment will agree to take 100,000 tons of rails. That
is to say the new enterprise is to pay higher
wages for less hours than the English maker does
-the difference on these two points will probably
destroy all the ad vantage to be gained by the sav
mg of freight. And then the small new local in-
dustry is to turn out work as cheaply as do the
and If 9l d -e sta bbsbed weH-eguipped foreign ones,
and if it does that and deposits £lO,OOO as well, it
is assured of one comparatively small order.

and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats!

several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matt it. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this sta-re
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure for
which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,’

“Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
“ Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
lam sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
tune it arnved. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and" was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every nmht for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to "the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus as walking caused me such pain and distr. ss in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for ms.great kindness in sending the medicine, and am
dear Sir, *
“Yours very truly,
“M. MORTIMER.’
Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, Katunga,
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
TIIE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE'S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as followsAs for myself, thank
the Lord lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Lure was again successful. I feel quite well,
ana walk into town feeling’ quite stronir.
I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
mgnt at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better
the night s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

DISTRESSING, SUFFOCATING, DRY COUGH

be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’
prescriptions and patent medicines having been tried

larse bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. lam more than

A Seven Years’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“ Dear Sir,—Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was soarcelv ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffen ng from a most violent cough, expectorating 1 blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment!
until I became, as I am now, quit e well. —Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.”
Asthma.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
A SEVENTEEN YEARS’ CASE.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charlevilie
Queensland, writes “After suffering from Asthma for
17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to iryHearne’s
medicine for Asthma. After laking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then
which was in the beginning of 1883- 15 years a»o— I have
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it ”
Writing again on the 4th April, 1899, he states'—“l
am keeping very well now. Never, have the slightest
return of the Asthma.” °

for instance, whose fame is universally known—class
themselves as infants in scientific invention and research,
and modestly tell us that they have but a smattering of
knowledge of the possibilities, extent, and development
We have only bo look at the fine buildings that occupy
the corner of Elizabeth and Bathurst streets to gain some
idea of the extent and importance of their professional
work. But to have the privilege of being shown through
the building by the Specialists themselves, and to see and
learn something of the real character of their wide prac,
tice, is a treat that only comes the way of a fortunate in
dividual like the writer. .. .
The instrument-room was, as usual, one of particular
curiosity. Laymen always have a penchant for eyeing
and examining the polished steel articles with which so
many extraordinary acts are performed upon the human
body. The collection in this room is in every way up-to-
date. Whenever a new instrument comes to the front,
and its worth is proved beyond question, it is added to
this rare assortment. Another room full of absorbing in-
terest is that devoted to the galvanic batteries, of which
there are several magnificent kinds. The noted Game
batteries, the finest French makes, are here in perfection,
irrespective of their high cost. If any article or mechani-
cal and electric contrivance is found necessary in main-
taining the fame of this institution, the price is never
allowed to stand in the way.
The correspondence department is a veritable eye-
opener. Its sacredness is a bar to a stranger’s admission,
but a full view of the work going on is had through the
glass doors. Half-a-dozen typists are seen driving their
machine-writers at electric speed. To the principals only
are known the names of the persons throughout Australia
who are being treated as skilfully in their homes about
the metropolis and away in the interior as if they 7 were
present in personal consultation at the institution.
The packing-rooms are likewise shut off from curious
and prying glances, and the work of one department is a
mystery to the others. No better system for holding
secret the nature of sufferers’ troubles, for safe-guarding
their interests, and giving due heed to the feelings and
sensitiveness of patients, could be imagined. Packages
are not plastered with advertising labels, they are put up
in such a way that only the names and addresses are in
V 1 What a practice is here revealed and what a consola-
tion must it be to these eminent specialists to know that
they are permanently curing and restoring to health and
happiness thousands of people whose lives were a burden
to them. The young, the middle-aged, and the healthy
are treated with the same amount of success. The pro-
digious nature of the work accomplished by these
specialists necessitates —not the stereotyped mornijng ana
evening two hours’ consultation ticket, but their constant
attention at the institution from early morning till late
into the night. “I can assure you,” said Hr. Wallace,
“ we don’t put in these long hours because we are fonder

told stores of strength and wealth wrapt up in this
it'requires no argument to convince the
most pronounced of optimists that the field m any one of
the great and honored professions of the day is far too
vast for the thorough comprehension of the most per-
fectly brain-endowed man, or body of naturally-gifted
men Yet in respect of the most delicate and difficult of
all professions-that of prescribing for the ll s i and
diseases of mankind —we find doctors, scattered over the
globe, off-handedly and without careful, minute, and
searching examination and diagnosis—without any know-
ledge of the past lives of patients—flippantly dashing off
prescriptions for every class of complaint, as if a cure was
as simple as falling over the proverbial log.
Thanks to the march of civilisation, culture, and edu-
cation, people are getting to know that modern medical
men who are worth consulting confine their practice to a
certain class of cases. Realising the utter hopelessness of
mastering and curing everything under the sun, and find-
ing that “gullibles ” are not so plentiful as they used to
be the wise and progressive men of medicine devote
themselves to one or other class of . cases, and work out
the remedies for them to the best of their skill and
a What better and more striking illustration of the suc-
cess of Specialists in Skin Diseases, Heart, Kidney, Liver
Affections, Rheumatics, Sciatica, Nervous Diseases, could
the people of this magnificent continent, Australia, have
than the enormous practice of the famous practitioners of
the Electro-Medical Institute. Their skill, attainments,
position, and renowned reputation stamp them as the un-
doubted masters of the classes of diseases and complaints
which have been the study of their professional lives.
When we speak of electricity we think of Edison. Why !
Because he dwarfs other men in this branch of science.
In the same way, when we talk of specialists, we at once
associate the names of the Freeman and Wallace Insti-
tute. So it is in every branch of scientific medicine;
some one or two men stand head and shoulders above
their fellows. „ . . , .
It is the aim, object, and devotion of certain doctors to
be pre-eminent in some defined class of disease rather
than to tinker with a host of complaints about which
they can have but a hazy notion, and superficial know-
ledge. To use a hackneyed but expressive phrase, they
are “Jacks of all trades and masters of none.” Never
since the time of Ricord, the noted French Specialist,
have any men conducted so gigantic and successful a
practice as that conducted by the Freeman-Wallace
Electro Medical and Surgical Institute.
of hard work than any other medical men ; we do it in
the best interests of sufferers. We don’t keep them
waiting longer than we can help, and we suffer many in-
conveniences for our patients’ sakes.”
Noble sentiments, thought the writer, as the time came
for his departure, and the Specialists returning to their
Vours truly . . .

we bracket in this category ? Dinners and drives and
conversaziones are more frequently uppermost in the
mind of top-loftical medicos than the speedy treatment
of sad and suffering patients.


All through the weary debate on the
Address-in Reply one indignant long-winded
person after another rose up to ask why
the Government didn’t instantly bring in a
Bill to deal with the Colored Labor question or
something like that. And Barton kept wearily
telling each jawful person in succession that
the Bills they were asking for were prepared, but
he couldn’t get a chance to do anything with them
till the crowd stopped talking about nothing, and
let the Address get through, and allowed the
Ministry to settled down to business. The habit
of demanding why the Government had been in
office all this time without doing this or that has
become so deep-rooted that the automatic M.P.
blows the remark off mechanically.
S. A. Assembly elections for certain Assem-
bly districts and a Council election for the big
Central District eventuate this Saturday. The
Central District contest is between millionaire G.
Brookman, who is making herculean efforts, and
Wallis, democratic nominee. The result will
greatly affect parties in the Council. With
Kingston’s place as democratic leader still un-
filled, the Radical party seems to lack enthusiasm,
as Well as numbers. Only recently the Labor
men wanted the election date altered because
.Tune Ist is a big race day. It looks bad that, in
a big Labor stronghold, and when Labor is fight-
ing a battle of such importance, the party should
be afraid that many of its supporters won’t vote
in their haste to get out about five minutes earlier
to look at a horse.
An important question is, whether a
Federal member may employ influence on a State
Minister to have State moneys expended in his
Federal electorate, so as to please his Federal
constituents and make his re-election all the more
secure. Minister O’Sullivan explains, indignantly,
that some N.S.W. road-and-bridge members, who
have gone to the Federal Parliament, where there
is no road-and-bridge department, and who never
had any idea about how to keep their seats except
by howling for roads and bridges, are back weep-
ing on the old official mat in the good old way
just when O’S. thought he was rid of them. After
the election the districts represented by these
people will also have a State member, and
O Sullivan says, quite rightly, that he won’t have
them both camping on his doorstep—he’ll sooner
kill one of them.

DUTY,
The Case of Mr. T. GLEESON,
(For the “ Suburban Tivies.”)
The destiny of great issues at stake de-
pends greatly upon the ability with which
they are handled. All audiences contain a
percentage of listeners who require plain
language to produce a comprehensive ap-
preciation of the matters under debate,
their perception not being sufficiently keen
to understand the purport of a brilliant
array of high-class words and phrases.
Learned men sometimes experience diffi-
culty in finding words to express uncom-
mon impressions, and Mr. Thomas Gleeson,
of No. 45 Turner-street, Redfern, acknow-
ledged himself similarly situated when re-
cently seen by a reporter.
“ Whenever I talk about it I can hardly
find words strong enough to express my
surprise and gratitude,” said Mr. Gleeson.
“ I was very ill for fully six months.”
“ What was your sickness like ? ”
«« I suffered from a severe attack of indi-
gestion, which nearly took my life. The
many complaints which arose from my dis-
ordered system made life not worth living.
To begin with I had a feeling of distention
or weight in my bowels, which were very
inactive, although I d.d everything that I
thought likely to give relief, without
success. Much annoyance was caused
through wind in the stomach, which made
a rumbling sound, and caused no end of
pain. I felt restless, and discontented with
everything. Things that used to interest
and entertain me I now looked at with dis-
like. Every little trifle that did not appeal
quite favourable to me I magnified into a
great trouble, making myself feel constantly
miserable. I could not help worrying my-
self with an unnecessary watchfulness for
some evil I expected to happen, whilst at
other times I was afflicted with a great
drowsy weariness, which made me unable
to move. I also had wandering pains in
various parts of the body, whilst other pains
remained fixed for months.”
“ Where were they most severe?”
'‘The agony I felt through a sharp,
pricking pain between the shoulders was
quite enough in itself ; but I also had a heavy,
stifling sensation in the chest. Wearisome
aches in the head never left me, and my
limbs were as tired as if I had been walking
without a rest for a week. Impure wind,
causing a nauseous taste in my mouth, arose
from the stomach, and my tongue was
covered with a thick coating. I changed to
a deadly colour, my lips being almost white,
and dark lines appeared under my eyes. The
act of stooping caused an unnatural rush of
blood to my head, and the giddiness which I
felt on straightening myself up nearly made
me reel to the ground. I was obliged to
hold on to something to save myself from
falling. A profuse perspiration broke out
all over me whenever I got a start, which it
took little to produce, and my heart beat
rapidly with nervous excitement when my
state of lethargy was suddenly disturbed.
It was a case of farewell to my appetite
from the start of my sickness. I had not the
least inclination to eat anything, and became
so weak that I was compelled to leave mv
work. I stuck to it as long as possible, but
when I found that every ounce of flesh had
left my worn-out frame I thought my case
was too serious to continue without laying
up.”
“ Could you sleep fairly well ?”
“ My mind was too troubled and irritable
co allow me any sleep, and when I got up in
the mornings I was like a dead man. I had
lost my strength and vigor, and always felt
languid and fatigued. I was so uneasy in
mind and body that I could not rest any-
where long. A sudden feeling of sleepiness
used to come on during the day, and then I
laid down, only to get up in a couple of
minutes andwanderabout like one demented.
Everything was a trouble to me, and my
painful afflictions became more numerous
and violent as time went on. I despaired of
a recovery, and gave way to despondency.”
“ I suppose you were taking medicine ? ”
“ Yes. I tried an endless variety of
medicines and pills, but not one of them did
me anv good. The only effect they had
upon me was to make me sick and increase
my misery. It was this bitter experience
which drove me to desperation. My sickness
seemed unconquerable.”
“ How were your sufferings overcome ? ”
“ By using Clements Tonic regularly till
it cleared the disease from my system. A
member of my family had reaped inestimable
benefits from Clements Tonic before I was
taken ill, and yet it did not occur to me till
now that it was the only medicine I could
expect to cure me. I made a start with
Clements Tonic, and it picked me up won-
derfully, reaching my weak parts at once.
The knowledge that I was raoid’y sinking
from exhaustion through excessive pain and
loss of appetite was dispelled by a few
doses of Clements Tonic, which made me eat
without feeling any bad after-effects. Con-
stipation troubled me no more, and my head-
aches were driven away. My eyesight,
which had been very poor during my long
sickness, was soon restored, and the melan-
choly languor gave way to renewed vivacity.
I never slept better in all my life than I did
after a dose or two of Clements Tonic, and
my limbs no longer ached with weariness in
the mornings. Once more I grew contented
and happy when I discovered that Clements
Tonic was working wonders with my debili-
tated constitution, and I was glad to be able
to go to work with a will. Every day im-
proved my general appearance, as my colour
came back and my emaciated frame got
stouter and more robust. The unhealthy
sensitiveness of my nerves was banished by
the stimulating and restorative effects of
Clements Tonic, which I continued to take
until it accomplished a thorough defeat of
my disease, not a single ailment of which
has troubled me since.’
“ Are you satisfied the cure is permanent?”
“ Perfectly. Nearly three years have
elapsed since my health was restored by
Clements Tonic, and I have felt grand all the
time. It is for that reason I desire to pub-
licly express my gratitude, which you are
at liberty to do in any way you think best.”

By Expelling all the Impure Deposits which lurk in the
Kidneys, KUTNOW’S POWDER re-vitalises those Weak
and Congested, and Restores their Filtering Power.
A BOON TO HUMANITY.
KUTNOW’S POWDER is the indicated
SUPREME REMEDY FOR ALL DERANGE-
MENTS OF THE STOMACH, LIVER, SPLEEN,
KIDNEYS, AND INTESTINES. IT PREVENTS
AND RELIEVES SICK HEADACHE, NERVOUS
HEADACHE, LANGUOR, HYPOCHONDRIA,
BILIOUSNESS, DYSPEPSIA, CONSTIPATION,
MORBID DEPRESSION, INSOMNIA, DROWSI
NESS, RHEUMATISM, GOUT, SCIATICA, AND
ALL CAUSES OF BRIGHT’S DISEASE AND
URIC ACID TROUBLES. The filtering power of
the Kidneys is limited, consequently any derangement
of the Stomach, Liver, or Bowels affects the Kidneys by
heaping up more injurious poisonous matter than their
filtering capacity can pass. Acting specifically on all
the great organs of the body concurrently, as the
greatest organic cleanser of the age, Kutnow relent-
lessly expels all deleterious matter, cleanses and disin-
fects each organ of putrid obstructions, and prevents
the absorption of vicious micro-organisms into the
blood. To insure uniform health Kutnow’s Powder is
absolutely indispensable.
The Safety Halve of Health.
VIVA-VOCE.— a very interesting discussion
about the origin of diseases caused by the intrusion of uric
acid in the tissues took place at the International Medical
Congress in Paris, in which the most prominent authori-
ties of England, Prance, and Germany took part. While
the authorities came to the conclusion that the ultimate
cause of the origin of uric acid has not as yet been
sufficiently explored, they unanimously agreed that, of
all the uric acid eliminators, KUTNOW’S Improved
Effervescent Carlsbad POWDER, composed of the most
valuable and curative elements of the most celebrated
Continental Medicinal Spring Waters,
OCCUPIES FIRST PLACE _AND_jS_UMEQUALLED.
lITM'S PIHDES
IS NATURE’S GREATEST AUXILIARY.
KUTNOW’S Improved Effervescent Carlsbad POWDER may
be obtained in capsuled bottles of all Chemists and Medicine Ven-
dors. See that the Registered Trade Mark, “ Hirschensprung ” (or
Deer Leap), and the autograph facsimile signature, “S. KUTNOW

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The man first became interested in the woman
beside him because of the uncommon color of her
great, tranquil eyes, whose deep liquid brown,
with golden streaks converging towards the pupils
like the rays of the setting sun, gave, from
their very strangeness, a weird effect to all her
face ; while the very spirit of reflection seemed to
brood and slumber under her dark, level brows.
Later, the man noticed that this woman’s com-
panion, on the other side, a woman also, never
addressed her at all. He wondered at this, for
the woman, who seemed to be a lady, was richly
and tastefully dressed in an exquisite evening
gown, and it seemed strange that she should be
alone. Yet alone she evidently was—and through
the play she sat and dreamed and seemed to listen
to the dialogue on the stage with face unmoved
and attitude unchanged. It was a five-act play,
and at the end of the third act the man hesitated
to go outside, wondering if, by remaining, he
could learn anything of this woman. His in-
terest in her had developed into curiosity.
Undecided, he half rose, then re-seated him-
self His action attracted the woman’s attention.
She glanced at him, and evidently recognised
something that appealed to her in his strong,
earnest face, for, meeting his eyes, she smiled
softly before she looked away. The man blushed
slightly, unused perhaps to such a situation. He
felt called upon to address her, and sought-about
helplessly for something to say, not caring to use
the commonplace assumption of previous ac-
quaintance, for he felt that it was no ordinary
woman who sat beside him.
“You don’t appear very much interested m the
play.” he hazarded at last, a little confusedly and
almost in an undertone. .
The woman courteously inclined her head to-
wards him.
“Dramas of this kind are so much alike, she
answered. “ There is the hero and the villain in
every one, and then the inevitable injured inno-
cent. I could put up with the others, but the
innocent!” A shrug of the shoulders and a slight
lifting of her brows accompanied the words.
“Plays are never naturally realistic, though
they pretend to be,” said the man; “they ex-
aggerate too much.”
“Where I quarrel with them is that they pro-
long an incident until it becomes the history of
several lives. Now look at this one; a real vil-
lain would have tired of dogging the poor hero
like this all round the world long ago; indeed,
he’d have been only too g:lad to escape undetected
from the consequences of his first crime ; a crime
is, after all, nothing but an incident, isn’t it? ”
The man smiled. “ I don’t know—there are
crimes and crimes ” he answered.
“ What constitutes a crime ?” asked the woman.
“ The intention.”
“ Ah, what a criminal then am I ! ”
“A very beautiful one,” said the man, softly
sending forth this remark as an explorer on an un-
known sea.
The woman understood him thoroughly, and her
eyes, meeting his, told him as much, and told
him, too, that she would ignore his remark because
he was handsofhe and interesting and unknown to
her.
“Did you ever commit a crime?” she asked
after a moment.
“ I think most of us have at one time or another
in our lives, or if we haven’t already, sooner or
later we will,” answered the man.
The woman was silent a while thinking, then
she asked : “ What crime was it you committed—
a great one ? ” .
“ The worst kind of crime —it related to a
woman.
“ Ah ! did you love her ?
“ Why do you ask that ? ”
“Because 1 have noticed that often men treat
worst the woman they love.”
The man rose from his seat hastily Will you
come to the balcony and have some coffee before
the curtain rises ? ” , , . . . ~ ,
The woman stood up and let him mid her
shoulders with a wrap; then she took his arm,
and they left the stalls together.
Presently they were seated among the cushions
at each corner of a lounge, with fragrant cups
beside them. The woman leaned back luxuriously
and watched her companion light a cigarette.
“You have not answered my question, she
said at last. . , . , .
The man blew many smoke-wreaths before him
before he replied.
“I sometimes think I loved her, he said.
“ Did she care for you ? Ah, but I need not
ask that question ; you could not have hurt her if
she had not. Where is she now ? ”
“She is dead,” answered the man. Bet us
talk of something else.”
“ What shall we talk about ?
“ Ourselves,” answered the man, quietly. 1
have often wanted to meet a woman like yourself,
whom I had never seen before, and talk with her
of myself and her, quickly—at once—before we
could get used to each other, and lose our first
keen impressions, outlines of each other. Do you
know what I mean ? ”
The woman looked up interested. Ah, yes—
so that we might see our own souls for a second as
in a looking-glass. Is that what you mean ?
“ Exactly,” said the man, with beaming eyes.
“How sympathetic you are —tell me quickly of
myself.” ... ,
“You are grave, strong, eager —you are full of
longing,” said the woman, gazing into the mans
eyes. “You are longing for a woman’s love
longing for the power to love a woman you have
not met —and the longing will not let you rest,
though you are weary ; and, oh, you are curious ;
you are burning to know everything everything
—you would go all lengths, do anything, to
know.
The man sighed deeply. “Yes,” he said ;
“Yes.”
“You have a beautiful soul, but it is so envious
and so curious it will not be beautiful always.”
The woman moved in her cushions and looked
away. “What have I been saying?” she asked.
“ I feel a little foolish, as if I have been talking
nonsense. Havel?”
“ I don’t think so,” answered the man, dreamily.
“Now, tell me what you think of me?” de-
manded the woman.
The man met her eyes, and stared into their
strange-colored depths ; then he turned away—
silent, ashamed and embarrassed.
“Tell me,” said the woman again.
“ I can’t; I am treating you unfairly,” answered
the man. “ Instead of trying to read you, I have
been thinking only of myself, and wondering at
the things you have said, and when I look into
your eyes I feel somehow that you are right, that
what you have said is true.” .
The woman laughed a low ripple of sweet-
sounding mirth. ,
“ How like a man to get the best of the bargain.
But, come now —although I can’t know your first
impression, still half a loaf is better than no
bread—tell me what you think of me now ?
The man glanced at her again. You are
sympathetic, and clever, and beautiful, he said,
“ How commonplace ! What a cheat you are !
Why didn’t you add goodness to my other virtues,
and purity and sweetness ? ” sneered the woman.
The man recoiled a little from the sneer. 1
owned-up I treated you unfairly ; you’ve no right
to attack me about my second thoughts of yout .
“Yes I have; you promised to tell me about
my soul, and you tell me about my body. Never
mind, we won’t quarrel over it; our acquaintance
is too short.” , . , _
“What age do you think lam?’
“Thirty.” , , T
“ And four years. I tell you that because I am
rather a curiosity ; I have lived all those years
without ever once falling in love, or even finding
out what love means ? ”
“ Why do you tell me that ?
“I don’t know; perhaps because you readme
so truly. I never told anyone else before.”
“Wasn’t it strange our talking to each other
and becoming immediately so intimate,” said the
woman ; “we must be queer people. Listen ! the
audience is clapping; the curtain must have gone
up long ago.” ...
“ There is nothing worth watching on the stage,
and I know no one in the house,” said the man.
“ And it is more comfortable here.”
“ And more interesting ? ”
“ Perhaps,” smiled the woman.
“ I have told you twice, now, that you are beau-
tiful. Each time you have ignored me. Why ? ’
“ Because a compliment like that is usually the
prelude to an attempt at love-making.”
“ Wouldn’t you care to be made love to ?
“ What an opening you give me to absolutely
crush you ! What if I replied, ‘ Not by you ?
The man laughed. “We each seem to have
tacitly agreed not to take umbrage at anything
the other may say. I would not have been
offended.” _ , ~
“ Well, no,” said the woman, I don t care
about being made love to. I’m so used to it, I
suppose.” , , , j
“ Are you a good woman ? asked the man, sud-
d6“ What a question ! ” cried the woman, flushing
hotly. “ Where are your manners ? ”
“ It isn’t a question of manners. ”
“Yes, it is. Every woman is supposed to be
good, and it’s the worst of manners to even
suggest that there could be a doubt about her.
“I didn’t imply a doubt,” persisted the man.
“ I asked you to decide for me.”
The woman regarded him curiously “ By that
question did you mean to ask me am I one of those
poor creatures of passion who live by what is
called ‘sin,’ or a woman, of the class I flatter
myself I appear to belong to, who has 1 sinned ’ ?
“The latter is nearly what I meant,” answered
the man. . . .
“ Then it is rather my status you are inquiring
into than my morals. I think you have made a
slight mistake.”
“ Status and morals both,” said the man ;
“ more morals than status. I don’t want to know
who you are, only what you are—you seem to be a
lady; but I can’t tell whether you are good or
not; you puzzle me.”
“You are very frank. I shall be equally so.
I hope lam a lady. I believe lam good.”
“Then why did you speak to mein there so
readily ; that was unconventional, surely ? ”
The woman laughed a long, sweet, low laugh
full of mirth.
“Fancy! so you are prejudiced and narrow-
minded, too. I swear I’ll never meet a man that
isn’t. Can’t a woman do an unconventional thing
without being immediately thought unladylike
and her morals brought into question. Listen —
tell me, do you consider me attractive ? ”
“Yes.”
“Has not my unconventionality attracted you
more powerfully and made you more intimate
with me than a long conventional acquaintance
would ? ”
“ Yes; I think it has.”
“And yet you think that if I am a lady and
good, I have done something very much beneath
me ; and although you participated in, and were,
in fact, responsible for, my conduct, you imagine
you have a right to scold me for it.”
“I don’t think you should have done it,” said
the man, gravely.
The woman leaned forward seriously, her chin
on her hand, her eyes shining brilliantly.
“Do you know what you and others like you
are doing?” she said. “You are confining
within very narrow limits the attractions of virtue,
while you allow every privilege and give every
encouragement to the allurements of vice. You
say that an innocent thing is evil, and frown at it
if a good girl does it, but you take great pleasure
in encouraging and applauding a bad girl in the
very same thing. Applause —bah ! —yes, that s
the word ! —man’s applause ! It’s what all women,
by force of circumstances, are compelled to strive
for, good women as well as bad. It’s our only
reward, whatever we may do.”
The man watched the woman gravely while she
spoke, and was silent for a moment after she had
ceased.
“ We only respect good women,” he said at last.
“Respect! pooh! How do you distinguish—
you pretend to respect the others, too ; at any
rate, in nine cases out of ten you prefer their
society.”
“ You seem to have studied the subject.
“ And why not. Is a girl forbidden to use her
brains ? ”
“ How bitter you are ! ”
“Am I ? Can you deny anything I have said ?
“Surely there must be some line of conduct to
mark the difference between good and bad ? ”
“ And yet a while ago you asserted that it is the
intention which constitutes the crime? ”
“You are very clever ; it is conduct, though,
we are speaking of now, not crime,”
“ A distinction only,” cried the woman.
“ What is it you want?” asked the man. “ You
surely don’t wish to invade the territory of the
bad woman, do you ?”
“ I want fair play,” answered the woman. “ You
men favor bad women too much. I want to invade
their territory to drive, not the bad women, but
you gods of men out of it. If it is a bad thing
for good women to be there, it surely is not the
best place for you, who pretend to the position of
our instructors, our judges ?”_
“Of course my position is indefensible, ad-
mitted the man, very seriously.
The woman broke out into a rippling peal of
laughter, then stretched forward and patted the
man’s face lightly and familiarly with her hand.
“ Ha, ha, ha ! Poor boy ; there, it won’t do it

Kidneys are the most important organs of
the body because they filter the blood.
The statement given below was made by a resi-
dent of Leichhardt, this city. If the same state-
ment had been made by some person in another
town or country it might, of course, be true, but
we would never know, because we couldn’t prove
it. But we can prove this statement, for the lady
who gives it lives right here in Sydney.
Mrs Pat. Duffy, 43 Marion-street, Leichhardt
this city, says: “Twelve months ago I took
Doan s Backache Kidney Pills for pain in the
back which I knew to arise from the kidneys.
Ihe doctor said that I could expect it owing to
the change of life. I had been taking various
remedies (both internal and external) without
getting any benefit. Only a few doses of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills released me from all mv
pain, however. J
“My husband had been suffering from kidney
troubles, and, seeing how splendidly they acted in
my case, lie took the same remedy. He works
for the council, at asphalting, and is out in all
kinds of weather. The pains in his back were
extremely bad. He had been unable to get more
Dan a passing relief out of anything he had pre-
viously tried, but Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured lnm. Since being cured, he was out work-
ing m the rain, and he caught a cold in his kid-
neys, and so he took more of the pills. They are
first-rate kidney pills, and he says that nothing-
ever did him as much good as Doan’s Pills. I
procured these pills at L. Newman’s pharmacy in
King-street.” 1
This is only one instance of what Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills are doing in Sydney. There
are hundreds of similar cases equally "as strong
and equally as convincing, and they are all Sydney
people For instance: Mr. W. Hibberd, St
“ ul ; street ' Rand wick, Sydney; Mr. W. Lane,

AMRROSE PRATT.
Do You Remember?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I wonder if you remember !
To-night I was carried back to the old scene—
to-mght of all nights—when I was listening to
‘ Tannhauser.” Strange, was it not ? The circle
of bright faces, the consciousness that my new
gown became me well, his chatter and Wagner’s
music, why should not these suffice me—that I
must go back like a child to the memory of a time
when you and I rode for a whole summer’s day
round the fences of the station up on the far
North-West plain ?
Surely you remember. Cannot you feel the hot
wind in your face now ? Do you not recall it as
you ride your solitary rounds over the yellow,
cress-grown run? How, in sheer lightness of
heart, we put our horses over the logs that lay
beside the road, and settled down to a three-fur-
longs gallop across the race-course plain: and
after that they started, and reefed and pranced
eager to be off again—do you not remember’
Ihose long, long fences ! Just past the old cattle-
camp lay the wide stretch of plain, where the
unbroken horses and the mares and foals stood to
stare at us cantering past—and then, with a whisk
of their tails, galloped away to a safe distance and
turned, while the big chestnut stallion snorted
defiance at us.
Do you remember the belt of timber at the edge
of the plain, and the great coolibah out in bloom ?
You stood up in your stirrups to reach a cluster of
the collarene, and fastened the creamy, heavy-
scented flowers in my dress with a kiss and some
foolish words. And you lifted me down under
the shade of the clump of box-trees and placed the
saddle for me to rest on, and boiled your quart
and unpacked your saddle-pouch. We ate our
bread and meat and brownie, and drank our tea.
Ihen you lay at my feet and said more sweet
things while you smoked, and I scratched my
initials on your blackened quart—are they there
J5 nder i ~H owl laughed, and pretended
that i did not believe what you said—just so that
you should force conviction on me with kisses !
. How still it was under the box-trees ! A little
impudent thirri-thirri was flirting his tail a few
yards away, and a family of apostle-birds busied
themselves over a crust I had thrown to them •
but no other thing disturbed that long, sweet
noon-tide. Presently you saddled the horses, and
we rode away again—past more fences, to the
boundary-rider’s hut, where his wife brought out
more tea, and her shock-headed, bright-eyed
children peered up under their dusty fringes of
hair.
We quarrelled a little after that, you and I,
and rode at least a mile in silence, and I wouldn’t
let you take my hand ; but we forgot our quarrel
m the excitement of killing the big brown snake
that glided away from under my mare’s forefeet.
When the sun was low we drove the sheep up to
Bngalow Tank, and X sat, with my foot swung
clear of its stirrup, watching you send them into
water and listening to the bleating of the ewes
the deeper calling of the rams, and the croaking
of the crows—that all seemed to make a natural
bush harmony.
You sang as you moved about the tank—simple
old songs—l’m afraid you wouldn’t have appre-
ciated Wagner to-night. You sang “The Broken-
down bquatter,” and “ A gallant young stockman
lay dying ! ” . . . What a little fool lam ! The
thought of those old times has brought the tears
to my eyes!
Then home, over the plain, turning purple and
grey where the far-off trees melted into shadow ;
and a last long kiss hidden by the timber beyond
which the station roofs lay white in the evening
light.
Do you remember ?

In Adelaide, not long ago, a man aged about
70 stepped into a crowded tram-car and looked
round for a seat. A very profuse and patronising
young fellow jumped up, saying, “Sit down,
dad.” The old fellow told him to keep his seat!
“No, no, dad; I’m better able to stand than you ”
said the showy colt, laying his hand on the old
man to push him into the seat. “Better able to
stend than I am, you young pup ! ” said the senior.

The Father of Wellington
Eighty-eight Years of Age \ Cured of Rheumatism
One Bottle Made the Cure.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla

>B*
. Mr. John Plimmer, of Wellington, New Zealand, sends us his photograph,
from which the above illustration was made. He is known as the “Father of
Wellington.” He is eighty-eight years of age and one of the best-known residents
of the city. His letter, which we give below, was written in a strong, clear, bold
hand. He says :
purchased a bottle. This one bottle of it cured me and I have not felt the slightest return of
the trouble since. I always keep a bottle of it in the house, for I find it a very refreshing remedy
for many conditions.”
After reading this letter you are certainly not surprised that in all parts of
the civilized world people call Dr. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
“ The World's Greatest Family Medicine.”
This great remedy takes out all poisons from the system and makes the
blood pure and rich. You cannot have rheumatism, scrofula, boils, pimples,
nervous exhaustion, and general debility if you will use Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
