National Notebook
Into smoke
/Commenting on the U.S. smoking
report Sir Macfarlane Burnet said;
“We must try to stop young people
starting to smoke. The best way we
could do that is to get well-known
athletes like Roy Emerson and Bill
Lawry to come out against smoking.”
This is a good idea, but one feels
that Roy Emerson would first get the
permission of his employers, Philip
Morris.
Twice the Talent
Scarcely taller than the microphone,
Matt Monro, a British singer
currently at the Chevron-Hilton, Sydney,
made a most agreeable first-night im-
pression. Twice as talented as his
immediate predecessor, Frank Ifield, he
had half the audience, which we suppose
proves something or other. Over lunch
next day he told us he had been a
London bus driver when he took it
into his head to make a private disc.
“I lent it to various
people and it came to the
ears of Winifred Atwell,”
he said. “Her husband
signed me up. I made a
few records for Decca and
Fontana, and they got
absolutely nowhere. For-
tunately my wife had a good job or
else —” he shrugged, conjuring up
visions of starvation and cold-water
flats.
“I was borrowing £1 a day. Finally,
I found I owed about £l5OO. And now
people ask me if I enjoy success! How
stupid can they get? Of course I enjoy
it!” He told us his break came with
an offer to record a jingle for a TV
commercial finally EMI made him an
offer, and “Portrait of My Love” and
“My Kind of Girl”, his two biggest hits,
sold 250,000 each.
“In England all you need is a hit
record without that you’re lost. In
America you can make nightclub appear-
ances, as well, but in England it’s
records, and records alone that count.
It makes me sick. A man doesn’t get a
chance without a song. It’s not the
singer, you see, only the number. There’s
a man in England, his name’s Dickie
Valentine, wonderful performer! But he
hasn't got a record, so while he was big
—the biggest—once, they’d hesitate to
put him on top of a bill now.”
Monro said that British artists were,
at last, beginning to make a dent in the
American charts, and he hopes that his
rendition of the title song in the hugely
successful “From Russia with Love”,
will be a smash hit in the States. After
meeting him, and seeing this unpreten-
tious and unaffected singer on stage, we
hope so, too.
Cheap at the price ...
A colleague of ours was recently
in Honolulu where he was enter-
tained by one of the island’s leading
families —one of the Big Five which at
one time controlled Hawaii’s economy.
At the family seat, a palatial home set
in tropical splendor, he overheard his
hostess goodhumoredly berate her son
for losing out in the Senate elections
to a mixed-race Hawaiian. “You simply
didn’t work hard enough,” she said, and
then added thoughtfully, “I knew we
should have bought that newspaper!”
Busy line
I>efore the new Pacific cable, Compac,
opened for business on December 3,
roughly 50 telephone calls a day were
made on radio circuits from Australia to
the United Kingdom. Now
the daily number is up to
250 and rising. Inward
calls via London have in-
creased, too, but are less
than half the outward
total. It seems to be the
rule that most of the calls
between any two countries are made
from whichever one has the smaller
population.
One sweltering night recently we
looked in at the Sydney International
Exchange, in Pitt Street, to watch the
passage of some of this cool undersea
traffic. The PMG duty officer, presiding
over about 14 girls at the green-and
amber-winking switchboards, told us he
was sorry it was all so quiet. “There are
no wool sales now,” he said, “the stock-
brokers aren’t busy yet, and of course
it’s the law vacation for barristers. They
all mean a lot of calls usually.”
In the background we could hear the
operators, every one of whom looked
smart enough to be dux of the class,
taking care of their callers. “I'll have to
call you back, Hong Kong.” “I’m sorry,
Mr Smith isn’t home this morning, they
say he’s at the factory in Brighton.
Would you like me to look up the num-
ber?”
The PMG man said Compac was
meeting a demand for calls that had long
been there, but which radio circuits had
been too unreliable to satisfy. He told
us there was seldom more than a few
minutes’ delay with the cable; the opera-
tors needed that time to verify the dial-
ling codes of places overseas. To show
how quick it was, he gave us a receiver,

plugged into the switchboard, and dialled
a number of 13 digits. There was silence
for 10 seconds and then a woman’s voice
came on, as clear as if she had been at
Manly, speaking to us in a Midlands ac-
cent. “Dish of the Day presents Layers-
of-Steak Pie”, she said. “All the ingredi-
ents are minced . . .”
She was the Birmingham Recipe Ser-
vice, one of the automatic test numbers
(Chicago’s Dial-a-Saint is another) used
to check circuits and also to train opera-
tors in dialling the long codes that get
right through to the wanted number.
It seemed a waste of public money not
to be copying the recipe down, but the
pie-maker's words went clean through
our amazed mind. The only thing that
has stuck was one of her closing instruc-
tions: “Paint it with melted booter”.
Historic Interest
HThese days artists seem to be growing
even more opaque than critics. When
the Spanish Information Ministry remov-
ed five of Australian artist Frank Hodg-
kinson’s paintings from a Madrid exhi-
bition because they were too sensual, Mr
Hodgkinson explained:
“There is no attempt to veil obscenity
with abstraction.
“On the contrary, I have tried by re-
moving layer after layer of superficiality
to penetrate the veil of reality and expose
some of the mystery which underlines
the actual.
“To present my findings I have return-
ed to primal forms. The thinking is time-
less; the balance of earth and life, the
symbolism of the corn and the phallus
presented afresh in a personal way.”

Limited Edition
\ limited edition of three short stories
by Cecil Mann has just been issued
by the River Press. The edition was sub-
scribed at three guineas a copy. Mr Mann
was a member of The Bulletin staff
from 1925 until his retirement in 1960.
He was then associate editor. During his
35 years, Mr Mann wrote for every sec-
tion of the paper, excluding perhaps the
financial. He was for a period Red Page
editor and theatre critic and had a par-
ticular fondness, and a particular apti-
tude, for the atmospheric sporting piece.
One of the tasks of Mr Mann’s later
years which should not go unrecognised
was the handling of much of the huge
volume of stuff which came from con-
tributors, and often in pretty rough form.
But many people who read the crisp, well-
put-together anecdotes which had been
through the patient and skilful hands of
Mr Mann imagined that there was a
vast store of natural writing talent in
this country. The talent was mostly Mr
Mann’s.
A volume of Mr Mann’s uncollected
short stories may appear later. At present
he is correcting proofs for the three-
volume edition of Henry Lawson’s prose
which he is editing for Angus and Rob-
ertson. For this he has gone back to the
original publication of many of the Law-
son pieces and has painstakingly correct-
ed textual errors which have gone
through later editions, one after the other.
Mr Mann has also supplied an introduc-
tion for the edition.

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Big Question
HTO critics of a certain tempera-
A ment there is an apparent
discrepancy between the Prime
Minister’s brave words of last
Thursday (and September 25) that
“Australia would assist Malaysian
and British forces to defend
Malaysia against external attack
and externally inspired subversion”
and Australian deeds. Indonesian
aggression against Malaysia and
Indonesian-inspired subversion in
Malaysian territory are established
facts here and now. Therefore, the
critics argue, in view of these stated
commitments by the Prime Minister
why is it that Australian troops are
not already shouldering their part
of the fighting in the quite brutal
guerrilla war in Borneo?
In the first place these critics
have not paid attention to the
Prime Minister’s September 25
statement which stated quite clearly
we would only “add” our forces to
those of Britain which must by
reason of its power, prestige and
commitment remain the military
guarantor of Malaysia. In the
second place it also stated that we
would do this if we were asked
formally. We have not yet been
asked. If Britain finds it can no
longer cope economically and
militarily with the situation we will
undoubtedly be asked to furnish
direct military aid and will un-
doubtedly respond. Until that time
except for those who relish the
oossibility of severing Australian
relations with Indonesia, who see
no problems in Indonesian political
and military retaliation in a sensi-
tive, vulnerable place like New
Guinea and who view with equa-
nimity the prospect of an estranged,
hostile neighbor for perhaps decades
—Australian caution over military
commitment is eminently sensible.
There was a time, and not so
long ago, when Djakarta took very
little notice of Australia either as
a political or potential industrial-
military power. The West New
Guinea fiasco showed us a friend-
less country with an unworkable
policy. This image is slowly
changing. Indonesia a country
which still imports nails—is show-
ing signs that it no longer dis-
counts Australia’s potential in-
dustrial and military capacity or
the firmness of our interests.
Djakarta is well aware of Aus-
tralia’s support for Malaysia and of
Australia’s military commitments to
it under certain circumstances. It is
aware of the close links between
Britain and Australia and it is
sharply aware, since President
Johnson’s letter to President
Soekarno and the meeting between
Soekarno and US Attorney-General
Robert Kennedy, that ANZUS in-
terests are being slowly and surely
brought into play. The big question
is not where Australia stands but
where Indonesia stands and how
far—in view of mounting internal
pressures and economic decline—
it is prepared to go in its policy of
confrontation before seeking a way
out of an untenable situation of its
own making.
Immigration Follies
TN two separate cases last week
the Immigration Department
showed first humanity and then
stupidity.
The humanity was in the case
of Mr Arthur Chan’s children. Mr
Chan, a naturalised Australian-
Chinese, has two children by his
first wife—a girl of 12 and a boy
of nine. They have been living in
Hong Kong and Mr Chan has not
seen them for seven years. For 18
months he and his Australian wife
have been trying to get permission
to bring the children to this
country. The Immigration Depart-
ment kept refusing permission be-
cause they could not prove that
Mr Chan was their father. Now, at
last, the Department has relented
and the children will join their
father and stepmother.
But the same week also revealed
that a stateless Chinese student,
Mr Lau Tin Chor, who is a first-
class accountant with special quali-
fications in costing, has been forced
to leave the country because he
came here on a student visa which
has expired. The two most absurd
aspects of the story are, first, that
the firm which was employing him
has advertised for an Australian
replacement but has failed to find
one of Mr Lau’s qualifications or
ability (It has, however, found
another Asian); and, second, that
Mr Lau h s migrated to Canada to
pursue his profession there and
ultimately to become a Canadian
citizen.
It will baffle the imagination of
all but the most dogmatic race-
mongers to understand why we,
who are so short of qualified ex-
perts, should force one to leave
Australia while Canada is keen to
snap him up. If it is a matter of
quotas for Asian migrants, like the
quotas we already have for Euro-
pean migrants, then the sooner
we work out some such scheme to
recruit qualified Asians the better.
For a start we might well follow
up the suggestion by Mr Lau’s
former employer in Melbourne,
Mrs J. O. Norman, and invite some
Canadian officials here to learn
from their experience of handling
Asian quotas.
We must not continue what
amounts to deporting intelligent,
qualified, law-abiding people who
show that they want to live in and
are easily assimilated by an
English-speaking country.

IMMIGRATION
The Shy
Mr Lau Tin Chor
Dreading the idea of being a cause celebre
H. OPPERMAN
Lessons from Canada?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
After studying at Swinburne Technical
College, Mr Lau Tin Chor, 23,
worked as an accountant at Norman
Brothers Pty Ltd, one of Melbourne’s
busiest stationers, in Elizabeth St. Then
Mr Lau closed his ledgers for the last
time and took a plane out of Australia.
His home was in North Vietnam, but
he was not bound for there. He had not
heard from his family for some time,
and in any case Mr Lau was a Stateless
person. He had no passport, only a
document of identity issued by the Hong
Kong authorities on which he had
travelled to Australia.
Mr Lau was happy in Australia and
had asked for permission to continue liv-
ing here. This had been refused by Mr
JH. Opperman's Immigration authorities.
Mr Lau confined himself to making re-
quests through normal channels. He did
not approach the local Member of Par-
liament, he did not take his case to the
newspapers or to organisations and in-
dividuals who would w illingly have taken
it up. Mr Lau w'as always polite, rather
shy, and dreaded the idea of being a
cause celebre.
Indeed, Mr. Lau saw the justice of
Australia requiring Asian students to re-
turn to their homelands when they had
finished their courses here. He himself
would willingly have gone home, had he
had one to go to. As it was, there was
nowhere he could go to except Hong
Kong—and he had no relatives or at-
tachments there.
Mr Lau’s future brightened when he
was given a visa to enter Canada. By
the time he embarked on his plane last
week, Mr Lau felt he had been given a
lot more than a mere piece of paper
entitling him to enter Canada. Arrange-
ments had been made for his arrival, and
through the Canadian High Commis-
sioner he had been supplied with advice
and information about his new country.
Mr Lau was being made welcome in
Canada, with every chance of becom-
ing a citizen there.
As Mr Lau wished, there was no hue
or cry over his ejection from Australia.
It was only after he had gone that Mel-
bourne learned of his case through a
letter in “The Age”. It was written by
Mrs J. O. Norman, a young widow who
divides her time between looking after
her six children and being managing
director of the family business. Her
comments perhaps reflected the courtesy
and restraint which she said were marks
of Mr Lau himself.
“Mr Lau did not seem like an Asian
horde; he is, in fact, a gentleman. He
had unusually high standards both of
honesty and business efficiency. We have
lost an admirable accountant with special
qualifications in costing.
“We are a simple business house, un-
skilled in matters of high policy, but it
does puzzle us that Canadians should be
clever enough to operate a quota system
which enables them to gain a well edu-
cated individual, such as Mr Lau, as
citizen at the expense of our training,
and we are not clever enough.
“During the W'eek I have been think-
ing what should be done, and wonder
if the Immigration Department could give
a lead in Commonwealth co-operation
by inviting one or several senior Cana-
dian immigration officials here, on ex-
change, so that we might gain from
their experience.
“A slightly comical footnote to our
genuine dismay at losing Mr Lau as our
accountant is added by the fact that an
advertisement has failed to produce any
suitable Australians to fill the post, but
we welcome Mr Yap via the Confucian
school in Kuala Lumpur and the Perth
Technical College. It all seems a little
silly, don't you think?”
THE RIVERINA
Mr Bolte, Imperialist
“They Play Aussie It tiles ”
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Qtrangely enough, it was not Mr
Bolte, but the Labor member for
Yarraville. Mr Schintler, who launched
the idea that the rich Riverina area of
NSW should be annexed by Victoria. Mr
Bolte was quick to agree and the zeal
with which he pursued the case has
now given him an excellent title to the
idea.
It all arose out of an interjection in
the Legislative Assembly last November
when Mr Bolte was speaking on the
second reading of the River Murray
Waters Bill. The Bill is to implement an
agreement between Victoria, NSW,
South Australia and the Commonwealth
for construction of the Chowilla Reser-
voir on the Murray. The reservoir will
be the largest water storage in Australia
and will shift the centre of gravity of
Murray waters from the Hume Reser-
voir. The new reservoir will bestraddle
the junction of SA, Victoria and NSW.
Some 530 square miles will be inun-
dated, of which about 10 per cent is
SA land, the balance being almost
equally in Victoria and NSW.
Such an occasion might have led
many speakers into homely discourse
on the virtues of interstate co-operation,
especially when the Commonwealth can
be cajoled into footing part of the bill.
But not Mr Bolte. True Victorian
that he is, he launched shafts at both
the Premiers of SA and NSW. He
accused Sir Thomas Playford of trying
to have the reservoir built solely for SA's
benefit, but he ran “into the insurmount-
able difficulty that the land to be inun-
dated was in Victoria and New South
Wales.”
He jibed that NSW was always unco-
operative about the Murray “because
people in that State believe all the busi-
ness from the area comes to Victoria.”
Then he said that at one stage of the
Chowilla negotiations NSW had claimed
it had no money to join in the project.
It was at this point that Mr Schintler
interjected: “We should annexe the


Riverina.” Mr Bolte replied: “I think
the people of the Riverina would
agree,” and let it go at that.
Next day, however, he had a lot more
to say. “Victoria is the economic centre
for the Riverina,” he said. Its wool was
largely sold in Victoria and its wheat-
growers used Victorian silos and rail-
ways. Its students favored Melbourne’s
universities and its fledgling nurses came
to Victorian hospitals for training. It
even played Victoria’s brand of foot-
ball. A lot also drink Melbourne beer.
In the next few days the Shire Presi-
dent of Jerilderie, Mr Fred McPherson,
was in favor of joining Victoria, but the
Mayor of Deniliquin, Mr Hector Camp-
bell, was not. The Mayor of Wagga,
Alderman I. J. Jack, though the Riverina
should only join Victoria if it could not
become a separate State. There was
support for Mr Bolte from Cr K. F.
O’Neill, a spokesman for the Tocumwal-
Mangalore Railway League which exists
to agitate for a £700,000 standard gauge
link between the two towns.
Opinion seemed to coalesce not so
much between staying with Mr Heffron
or joining Mr Bolte, as between the
issues of joining Victoria and forming a
new State.
There was hardly a good word for
Mr Heffron’s Government, even though
many were sceptical about coming under
Mr Bolte’s fiat. The Victorian Premier
was accused by Mr Heffron of emulat-
ing Soekarno. Like many a statesman on
a wider world stage, he retaliated by
inviting Mr Heffron to hold a plebiscite
in the area. Mr Heffron declined.
In recent years the most vigorous
separate-State movement has been the
New England one, but the Riverina
separatists, though dormant for many
years, have a long and creditable history
going back well into last century.
It was at its strongest during the Lang
Government and in 1931 presented a
petition to the Commonwealth Prime
Minister, Mr Scullin, claiming it had over
a thousand branches covering every
town and district in the area.
However, if Mr Bolte is not content to
leave Mr Heffron in the pincer jaws of
separatist movements in the north and
south of NSW, there is another ploy open
to him. That veteran campaigner for
new States, Mr Ulrich Ellis, argues that
the Riverina is legally part of Victoria
anyway, under the terms of the 1851
separation. According to Mr Ellis, this
defined the eastern end of the Victoria-
NSW border as “a straight line from
Cape Howe to the nearest source of the
Murray.” However the argument runs,
the Murray in those days was not as we
know it now. The section of the river
above and east of the Murrumbidgee
junction was known as the Hume River.
This would make the nearest source of
the Murray the headwaters of the
Murrumbidgee near Cooma. A line from
Cape Howe to the Murrumbidgee at this
spot would give Victoria all of the
Riverina and a lot of Snowy as well.
The Royal Geographical Society
accepted this view of the border in 1902,
and in 1906 the Victorian Premier, Sir
Thomas Bent, temporarily took it up.
In 1911 the Watt Government served a
claim on NSW for the territory after
getting advice from a London KC. It
was, of course, rejected. Mr Bolte has
not yet aired these legal - geographic
arguments. He may never, but the issue
has gained plenty of attention in Mel-
bourne to an extent which might surprise
sceptics from other States.
TRADE
Rocks on
the Road to Geneva
Free trade for them, not for us?
SIR A. WESTERMAN
Trade chief
FROM JOHN GIBBS IN SYDNEY
TVlk of freer world trade to follow
the GATT conference at Geneva
this year sounded rather hollow to Aus-
tralia last week when it learned of diffi-
culties likely to be encountered in
Washington and London by Sir Alan
Westerman and his negotiators.
Washington lobbyists are trying to
obtain restrictions on Australian beef
exports to USA and a Senate finance
committee has ordered a tariff in-
vestigation which will commence on
April 28. Britain proposes to scrap the
existing 15-year meat agreement with
Australia guaranteed until 1967 and
impose a quota system instead. Britain
also proposes a minimum price system
for wheat imports which would place
Australia on the same basis as any other
wheat exporter.
Britain's proposals are out-and-out
protectionist in policy, yet designed to
reduce the direct cost of £stg3som. a
year in subsidies paid to UK farmers.
If anyone wishes to sell wheat to Britain
at below the minimum price, a levy
will be imposed which will help to pay
the subsidy to UK farmers.
The British claim they also will seek
restraints on local production, including
a limit on price guarantees to the British
farmer based on a maximum production
level. She thus makes a gesture to
Common Market members by saying, in
effect: We are freeing agricultural trade
to the extent that we’ve placed everyone
on the same footing for imports and we
also are limiting local production so as
to encourage more imports.
Not only can the British claim to have
given outsiders a chance to get into the
UK market at stable prices, they can also
assert they have set up an agricultural
pricing system which is less protectionist
than the Common Market and therefore
is a contribution towards the Kennedy
Round of liberalised tariffs. This liberal-
isation evidently includes the elimination
of preference to countries like Australia.
Unless Britain is trying out this pro-
posal on the US and the Common
Market merely to determine reaction,
it seems unlikely that, once having intro-
duced such a complicated system, they
will scrap it overnight. On the other
hand, it could be an example set for the
Common Market members so that they,
too, will restrict production and permit
imports at a minimum price level.
The situation, hardly cheering to
Australia and New Zealand, also points
up some of the deficiencies in some of
our own subsidiary primary industries.
New Zealand, threatened with a loss of
markets in Europe, would like to supply
Australia with dairy products, but the
entry of cheaper New Zealand items
would spell disaster to the heavily sub-
sidised local industry if “free” trade were
permitted.
Some soul-searching must be under-
taken by all nations when they enter the
Kennedy Round because, on current evi-
dence, no one is prepared to make any
tariff concession unless there is some
corresponding gain. The US, for all, its
high sounding ideals on trade liberal-
isation, has illustrated that it can yelp
as loudly as anyone when local interests
are affected. US cattlemen are being
extremely vocal in their demands for im-
port restrictions and if they can get two
nations to agree on voluntary restraints,
Australia could fall into a trap.
If two countries which are supplying
“significant” quantities of a specific
commodity agree to restrict their US
sales, the Administration is empowered


to introduce mandatory quotas on all
other foreign suppliers of such com-
modity. Also, as illustrated by the recent
US complaint on steel drain pipes from
Australia, the dumping law can be in-
voked in the US if sales of a commodity
are less than the average price in the
importing country.
Such restraints on trade permit the
US to prevent a flood of cheap goods
from Hong Kong, Japan or elsewhere.
Another effective barrier, the US quota
system, is well known to Australian
producers of commodities such as lead
and zinc.
Therefore it should be increasingly
clear to the primary producing nations
that the coming round of negotiations
on tariff reductions and “freer” trade
are going to provide serious problems
in their fight for markets. If the primary
producer nations agree to a reduction
of tariffs on manufactured goods—and
this is what highly industrialised nations
like the USA and UK require to solve
their own balance of payments problems
- there is no guarantee the primary
producers will achieve wider markets for
items which already are encountering

UNIVERSITIES
More Orr Resignations?
Mr Reece’s Second Thoughts
SIR HENRY BAKER
Back?
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
HPhose members of the Tasmanian Uni-
versity Council who finally mustered
the numbers to settle the seven-year
dispute over the dismissal of Professor
S. S. Orr are deeply perturbed by Hobart
Government-backed efforts to secure the
back-stairs return to the Council of the
leading opponents of settlement.
One of them said last week; “They
showed no confidence in us by resigning
over the Orr settlement, so how can we
logically express confidence in them if
they return to the Council?” The
personal feeling is strong; but even
stronger is resentment at the attempt of
the Government to interfere in the
affairs of the University. More pervasive
still is the fear that the return of the
reactionary element to the Council will
upset the new spirit of harmony now
flowing through the University.
Some consider those who resigned
were guilty of a breach of confidence
when in their Press statement they gave
information (about the £16,000 pay-
ment to Orr) which was at that point
strictly confidential to members of the
Council, and they gave it. according to
their critics, in the hope of wrecking the
settlement. There is even talk of new
resignations if the Reece Government
persists in lobbying for their reinstate-
ment.
When the Orr settlement was
announced, the Chancellor, Sir Henry
Baker, MLC; the Deputy-Chancellor, Mr
A. W. Knight; Professor H. N. Barber;
Mr H. J. Solomon and Mr J. T.
Wertheimer announced that they would
resign from the Council. Next day, Mr
C. R. Baker also resigned. The seventh
opponent of the settlement, Dr D. W. L.
Parker, did not resign.
The Premier, Mr Eric Reece, has not
attempted to conceal his aversion to the
settlement with Orr, and he has strongly
supported the return to the Council of
the Government nominees and Sir Henry
Baker. No doubt he would back the
Hobart sectional pressure for Mr
Wertheimer's return, but in this he is
powerless, for Wertheimer was nomi-
nated by the Council itself. It would not
put him up again.
The Government may have hoped to
get its three nominees to withdraw their
resignations, so that it could swiftly and
quietly renominate them. If that was its
intention, it was frustrated by a long
story on the situation in “The Examiner,”
which has consistently supported the
settlement of the Orr case. Mr Reece
now seems to be having second thoughts
and may have at last learnt it is better
to take advice on University matters
from those who understand the problems
of the University.


IN THE RED
The Finances of the
Communist Party
How to spend £250,000 a year
L. AARONS
Worry
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
TT|uring a year in which other political
parties have found difficulty in mak-
ing financial ends meet, the Communist
Party of Australia has spent money like
Tommy Manville in pursuit of another
wife. New headquarters in Sydney at a
cost of over £52,000, a large new book-
store in Sydney’s busy and expensive
Pitt Street, new premises for several
subsidiaries and weekly radio broadcasts
were just some of the things that promp-
ted the question: Where does the money
come from?”
The Communist Party always shows
great reticence concerning its income and
expenditure but a careful scrutiny of its
various publications leads to the follow-
ing conclusions:
Expenditure in 1963 was approxi-
mately £250,000. (The correct figure
may be a little less, but only a very
little.) Wages for the 70 full-time Party
functionaries and 50 full-time subsidiary
functionaries would take up an esti-
mated £lOO,OOO of this amount.
The main Party school at Minto, NSW
(there are others in other States), cover-
ing an area of 13 acres, is reported to
have cost, with buildings and equipment,
£20,000. The school is in operation for
at least 30 weeks of the year with an
average of 20 to 24 pupils at a time.
Apart from their maintenance, food,
books, etc., the majority must be paid
some sort of wage to maintain their
families during their absence from work,
which would run the year’s cost to an
under-estimated £6OOO.
Propaganda costs in NSW run into the
£50,000 mark. Most of the Party publi-
cations originate in NSW and none is
known to show a profit. For instance,
as far back as 1958 the weekly “Tri-
bune” was reported in the “Communist
Review” to be losing more than £2OO
per week. As costs have risen and the
price remains the same at sixpence and
there is no evidence of increasing sales,
that figure must still stand. Added to
this are losses from the theoretical
monthly “Communist Review,” the
monthly youth journal “Target” and the
journals of subsidiary organisations
aimed at women, students and teachers,
writers, etc. But this is only the top layer.
Beneath it are the leaflets, pamphlets,
roneod suburban news-sheets and roneod
job-sheets produced in every union in
which Communists are active and appear-
ing at intervals ranging from a month to
a week. During the year the Party broad-
casts weekly talks from up to 10 NSW
country radio stations.
Victoria shows the next highest ex-
penditure on propaganda with its weekly
“Guardian” losing money at an undis-
closed but high rate. The new
intellectual quarterly “Arena”, which is
published in Victoria, on its own state-
ment costs ss. per copy to produce and
sells at 2s. 6d. There were a thousand
copies of “Arena” No. 1 printed. Vic-
toria, too, has its leaflets, pamphlets and
roneod news and job sheets, as do the
other States. The national figure for
propaganda would be greatly in excess
of £50,000.
Travel costs also run into a pretty
penny, about £BOOO to £lO,OOO. There
are four Central Committee meetings
held in Sydney during the year and the
12 to 14 CC members from WA, SA,
Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland have
to be transported to and from these
meetings. The Political Committee meets
each month in Sydney and members
must be brought from Victoria and
Queensland. Then there is overseas travel.
When a functionary visits a Communist
country, his or her stay there is free but
it is usual for travelling expenses to the
country concerned to be paid by the
Australian Party; and the number of
functionaries who travel overseas (al-
most invariably by air) is fantastic.
But travelling and living cost - free
in other countries cuts two ways, as
visitors sponsored by the Australian
Party and its “front” organisations must
be given the same treatment while in
Australia.
Further expenditure goes on the cost
and maintenance of the Party’s motor
vehicles which are used constantly by
the country organisers in all States. Rent
and maintenance for printeries, book-
shops and premises rented in Newcastle,
Brisbane, North Queensland, Wollon-
gong, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide,
Perth and Hobart (many in high-priced
areas), plus electricity, phones, stationery,
postage costs and all the incidentals that
go to make such a complex organisation
must be enormous.
Subsidiary organisations also must be
financed. In this relation we quote a
paragraph from the “Communist Re-
view” of March, 1963, concerning the
Union of Australian Women “There
were 1800 greeting cards printed, a
central function comprising a buffet for
250 was held, 3000 special bulletins were
distributed at factory gates, another
special leaflet printed, a hastily prepared
leaflet on Cuba and a Congress (over
two or three days) held in Sydney Town
Hall with delegates from all over Aus-
tralia and overseas.” Equate the costs
of the above with all the activities of
all the subsidiaries and “front” organisa-
tions and the mind begins to boggle.
There are other money-devouring ac-
tivities many of them but enough
have been mentioned to make the figure
of £250,000 appear not unreal.
Mow to income. Nowhere in the amor-
■*■ phous cloud of Party talk and writings
is there more double-talk and fog than
around this subject. The same sum is
quoted and requoted, switched from one
collection to another, divided, multiplied
and quoted again. The same collection
is reported in a number of different
ways to give such an inflated figure that
in the end no figure can be believed.
For example, “Tribune” (8/1/64) speaks
of £20,000 having been collected in the
Sydney district alone in six months.
Ridiculous! In spite of all the fog sur-
rounding the issue the Party’s national
income for 1963 could not possibly
have been in excess of £130,000. This
estimate is based on the following data:
Each Party member must pay dues.
For those with an income of over £7
a week the amount is 525. per year;
others pay 13s. The strength of the Com-
munist Party is now about 4500 which
would bring in £11,700 a year if all
paid the higher rate. This does not allow
for all the young people, pensioners,
housewives, etc., who would pay only
13s. but we shall let the figure for dues
stand at £11,700.
Two Finance Drives or Fighting
Funds are held each year and last year
the overall target for 1963 was £lOO,OOO.
It is extremely difficult to gain any rea-
sonable account of the money actually
collected but from what reports were
available it would appear that NSW with
targets of around £12,000 per six months
did achieve somewhere in that vicinity.
Queensland, with a target of £6OOO in
the second drive, reported collecting
£6013. South Australia, Western Aus-
tralia, Tasmania and the Northern Terri-
tory give no indication of success or
failure. On past performances this means
that their targets were unfulfilled.
Victoria’s first drive for £lO,OOO was


definitely not achieved. The second drive
was for £12,500 which was planned to
be filled by Christmas. But less than a
fortnight before this date the Melbourne
“Guardian” reported that £3500 still
remained to be collected. While it ap-
pears certain, then, that the overall
target of £lOO,OOO was not attained, we
shall still allow that figure to stand.
From time to time the Party’s press
reports large sums as being collected at
special meetings or the donation of large
sums by individuals. But it is important
to remember that such amounts are in-
cluded as part of the target for the
particular State concerned that is,
as part of the £lOO.OOO. The same ap-
plies to raffles, be they for a fowl or a
Holden car, and to such sweeps as are
run regularly on the Melbourne Cup, etc.
There is also an annual competition
for the Popular “Tribune” Seller and
£3153 was reported as collected from this
source in 1963. “Tribune” Fairs were
held in the major cities and reported
receipts from these were Sydney-Gran-
ville £ll3O, Wollongong £6O, New-
castle <£7o. No figures were given for
the other fairs but £4OO would more
than cover them.
Donations to the three Party news-
papers provide a little more income. In
1963 “Tribune” received £B7O in dona-
tions, the Queensland “Guardian” £l3OO
and the Melbourne “Guardian” £650.
Thus we arrive at an overall sum of
£119,333.
Moneys reported as donated by trade
unions, whether raised by voluntary do-
nations or levies, are nearly always for
election purposes and so do not come
within the scope of this article.
The only other sources of income
known are profits made by Party prin-
teries from the printing of trade-union
journals and whatever other jobs they
can pick up and profits made from nor-
mal book sales and the sale of literature,
curios, etc., imported from the Soviet
Union and other Communist countries.
In the main, only a small portion of the
cost of such literature must be paid to the
country of origin and it thus becomes a
source of revenue. The distribution and
sale of such literature, however, is
amateurish and wasteful. One distribu-
tion centre had an accumulated debt of
£3OO cancelled by the central distribu-
tion agency.
Once again being over-generous we
might allow these last two sources a
profit of £lO,OOO and we are then left
with the following figures for Party
chiefs like Laurie Aarons to worry about:
Expenditure: £250,000
Income: £129,330
Deficit: £120,670
Either the Communist Party has un-
revealed holdings in some very profitable
enterprises, or is financed by some bene-
volent capitalists, or ... ?
BY-ELECTION
Athol Townley’s Seat
Where people vote for people , not parties
W. C. HODGMAN
Endorsement?
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
'T|enison, where a by-election is to be
held on February 15 to elect a
successor to Athol Townley, is the only
wholly metropolitan division in Tas-
mania, and on paper it is the toughest
Tasmanian seat for the Liberals to win.
Mr Townley held it in the 1961 land-
slide with an absolute majority of more
than 1000 —at least equal to 2000 if
DLP votes are taken into account. But
last November his majority was reduced
to 800, though the national Liberal vote
was up and his Labor opponent, Dr
D. M. Finlay, was not highly rated.
Labor, indeed, had been under difficulties
in finding a willing starter. Finlay was
open to DLP attack because of his visits
behind the Iron Curtain, but the Liberals
did not press the issue.
Finlay has again received ALP en-
dorsement for the 1964 by-election, but
the Liberals have not yet selected a
candidate. Athol Townley’s son and his
brother, Rex, were suggested, but neither
is willing. Rex Townley, former State
Liberal leader, has not enjoyed good
health, has heavy business commitments,
and is shadow Education Minister of the
Liberals. A couple of Hobart doctors
have been mentioned. One is Dr Young,
MHA, a leading member of the State
Opposition. There has even been talk
of re-admitting Mr Bill Hodgman to the
Liberal fold and endorsing him. He was
returned as a Denison Liberal at last
State election but broke with the party
and sits as an Independent Liberal.
Also favored are Mr A. R. E. Pollard,
a former British Regular Army half-
colonel who has done well as an insur-
ance man, and Mr Reg Blundstone,
popular as a sportsman and one of Mr
Townley’s strongest supporters.
The result is likely to depend on the
Liberals’ choice of candidate rather than
on the Labor Party’s: Tasmanians vote
for people rather than parties.
QUEENSLAND
Reforming Anzac Day
A break-through in Toowoomba
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
p\)R more than 40 years, under an Act
of Parliament, Anzac Day in Queens-
land has been a total day of mourning.
But in recent years this provision has
been the subject of a gathering storm
of criticism in which many ex-service-
men have joined. Outside Queensland,
a day of mourning is prescribed only in
New Zealand. Hotels are closed all day.
Last week in Toowoomba, the “capital”
of the Darling Downs, a move was made
for a break-through in line with the
opinion of the “revolutionaries” inside
and outside the Returned Servicemen's
League. This is for Anzac Day morning
to be solemn, but for the afternoon to
be “open”, with sporting and other
activities.
The Toowoomba RSL has agreed to
a children’s sports afternoon provided it
is endorsed by a public meeting to be
held next month. The usual Anzac Day
morning ceremonies are planned. The
Australia Day celebrations committee is
planning for recognition on Anzac Day
of both that day and Australia Day, “to
strive for a national day following the
falling away of interest in both days.”
As expected, the State president of
the RSL, Sir Raymond Huish, who has
given great service to the League, did
not express keenness about the move.
The State Government, led by League
member Premier Frank Nicklin, con-
tinually sits on the fence. If the League
agreed, the Government would soon
give way.


A Season for Sharks
Since 1792 - 113 fatalities in Australian waters ...
By RICHARD HALL
Every season is a season for sharks
in Australia. In the 172 years
since the first shark victim was
officially taken note of in Australian
waters about 113 men, women and child-
ren have been fatally mauled around the
Australian coastline from Torres Strait
in the far north to the south-eastern
coast of Tasmania, in all seasons of the
year.
The total number of deaths is a frac-
tion, and an insignificant one, of the
numbers who have died from the auto-
mobile since the turn of the century,
but the shark is something of a national
obsession. The world’s clearing house for
shark data, the Shark Research Panel at
Washington DC, receives during the
summer season an average of 100 news-
paper cuttings a week from Australia
with references to sharks.
For Australian swimmers the harsh
clang of the shark alarm bell driving
surfers from the water is as much a
fact of life as the sound of a car horn.
Uncounted thousands are spent every
year on the upkeep of nets in harbors
and bays, on meshing and on air patrols.
The shark is a subject for more old
wives’ tales and sweeping generalisations
than even such other objects of popular
superstition as snakes.
The shark has inspired plenty of
theories, many of them conflicting. But
whatever the debate on the contending
theories the usefulness of two deterrent
measures, the air shark-spotting patrol
and the meshing of beaches, is clearly
established.
Sydney had an air patrol in the ’thirties
when an aged DH4 covered the beaches,
but the patrol was called off after a
controversy when a surfer was attacked
at Maroubra just after the plane had
passed and allegedly signalled all clear
through an amplifier.
But the 1950 s saw a revival through-
out Australia of the air-spotting system.
The first consistent patrol was mounted
along the Illawarra beaches north and
south of Wollongong eight years ago by
a volunteer pilot, Tony Bevan. Flying
as a hobby pilot, Bevan, during the week
a real estate manager, thought that shark-
spotting might give some purpose to
his flights and, like so many people who
become involved with sharks, he has
found it becoming the equivalent of a
full-time job. Now every Saturday,
Sunday and public holiday he patrols the
local coastline, providing the only
regular Australian volunteer service.
His work helped to get him elected
to the local Council with a record
majority in his ward. Army disposals
radio sets are used to keep him in direct
touch with surf clubs.
A few miles to the north the 2SM
shark patrol plane over Sydney’s beaches
on weekends and holidays throughout
the surfing season has become something
of an institution after operating during
three seasons. Since the patrol began in
a chartered plane on the Australia Day
weekend in 1962, aircraft have flown
over 40,000 miles, the equivalent of
nearly twice around the world. The
station’s initials, a couple of feet high
on the side of a brightly-painted Cessna,
carries the promotion message to the
beaches and a relay system through the
station’s studio carries the warning
message direct to the beaches through
the ever-present blaring transistors or by
phone call to the surf club houses.
The patrol goes up for an hour in
the morning with a basic mission of pre-
dicting surfing conditions for the after-
noon crowds. But it is the long after-
noon patrol, when the big crowds are
on the beaches, that plays the vital role.
The plane takes off from Bankstown,
Sydney’s light-aircraft aerodrome, at
noon and does not return till five.
In the five hours the patrol covers all
Sydney’s ocean beaches from Cronulla
in the far south to Palm Beach on the
edge of the Hawkesbury River estuary.
Like most regular patrols, much of the
five hours can be monotony and eye
strain. Ten times the plane sweeps the
36 miles between Cronulla and Palm
Beach.
When The Bulletin went up on the
patrol last Sunday week it was another
quiet day in what has been a relatively
quiet season for the patrol, with a pro-
gress total of just over 60 sharks
sighted in the season compared with
totals like the 99 sighted over the Aus-
tralia Day weekend last year.
In the 360-odd miles of cruising only
three sharks were sighted that afternoon.
That was three and a half hours after
the patrol had begun. Till then it had
been a fruitless patrol with nothing but

patches of seaweed and an old tin can
to deserve a second look.
Even the shock of what must be one
pf the ugliest sights in the world, the
famed ocean suburb of Bondi from 500
feet up or the dreariness of the virtually
treeless red-tiled wasteland of Bondi’s
neighboring coastal suburbs, can cease to
fascinate after the sixth time, without
the distraction of a shark.
After hours of peering at the shifting
ocean on a day with choppy seas it can
become difficult for the inexperienced to
believe that shark-spotting from the air
is useful. But the only sighting of the
day’s patrol off the north-side beach of
South Narrabeen provided dramatic
proof of the job such patrols can do.
The pilot sighted the first shark, a five-
foot hammerhead twisting erratically
through the water only 150 yards from
a small group of surfers. As the plane
turned to bank and circle tightly the
surfers, recognising the break in routine,
scattered swiftly from the water. On the
turn two other sharks were sighted, both
hammerheads, one about five feet but
the other more than ten feet. At the end
of the turn, and within 90 seconds of
the sighting, the station’s spotter in the
plane, journalist and surf-club member
Errol Bailey, was getting the first message
over the air. On the beach a scratch
boat crew, attracted by the plane’s
circling, was getting together. About a
mile and a half to the south at the bigger
and more popular beach of Collaroy
surfers were getting out of the water also,
to be on the safe side.
In a little over three minutes the boat
crew was pushing through the first line
of breakers. But by then the hammer-
heads had gone skittering back into
deeper water and the alarm was over.
(Like most other questions connected
with sharks, there is debate on whether
hammerheads are dangerous to man.
There is no recorded Australian attack,
but recently-published American records
refer to two hammerhead attacks.)
The three sharks had stood out in the
water with a clarity that came as a
surprise to the inexperienced There is
no doubt that if there are sharks within
striking distance of surfers near an
ocean beach an air patrol can sight them.
Patrols are expensive
Queensland has had aerial shark
patrols on and off since a bad sea-
son in 1950 when one man was killed
and another attacked. A Melbourne
radio station started a regular shark
patrol along Port Phillip Bay down to
Sorrento and Portsea as well as Ocean
Grove-Torquay. So far this season the
patrol has sighted 100 sharks. Adelaide
and Perth also have aerial patrols. The
cost of keeping such a patrol going can
be heavy. 2SM estimates that charter
alone, without wages, costs £5OO a
month, a price probably worth paying
for its promotion value in the bitterly
competitive world of Sydney’s com-
mercial radio. The patrols serve a simple
purpose —to get the surfer out of the
water when there are sharks around.
But the one scare of the day over,
the patrol returned to the dull routine.
In the last hour a message relayed to
the plane when it was over Cronulla on
the southern end of its sweep told of a
shark sighting at Newport, 30 miles
away to the north, and the plane turned,
picking up speed. Surf clubs ring the
station to ask for the plane’s assistance
to help their boat crew when they sight
their own sharks. But by the time the
plane had got there the shark had gone.
But the South Narrabeen sightings had
brought the running total of sightings to
577 since the patrol began. At times the
patrol has been responsible for the
closing of beaches, and earlier this
season gained praise from the chairman
of the SLSA, Judge Curlewis, when it
broke up a surf carnival at South Narra-
been when sharks were sighted only
a few yards from competitors.
However, the Sydney patrol has one
particular difficulty. It flies at 500 feet,
that is below the normal civil aviation
limit for private aircraft. At this height
the Department of Civil Aviation,
reasonably enough, wants to keep the
plane over water. But this limit keeps
the plane east of the coastline, although
with special permission it has been flying
over Camp Cove, a small harborside
beach just inside South Head. But Middle
Harbor, that stretch of water which has
the worst fatality record of any area
around the Australian coast six dead
since 1942 —has no aerial patrol.
World research on sharks has been
unco-ordinated and on a relatively
meagre scale until the last five years,
when the American Institute of Biological
Sciences set up a Shark Research Panel
to collect and collate information.
Backed financially by the resources of
the Office of Naval Research, the
Americans, as usual, have been able to
get basic work under way which has
been neglected because of lack of
money.
The chairman of the Shark Research
Panel is Dr Perry Gilbert, Professor of
Zoology at Cornell University, NY,
almost certainly the greatest living expert
on sharks. Dr Gilbert, who is in Aus-
tralia currently for work during his
sabbatical year and to attend the
ANZAAS conference, is, in a pleasant
amiable way, crazy about sharks.
He even wears around his neck on a
chain a shark’s tooth twenty million
years old, found in prehistoric Cali-
fornian diggings. Dr Gilbert has been
interested in sharks for thirty years and
published his first scientific paper in
1941 when there was little interest among
scientists in sharks. Dr Gilbert will talk
almost enthusiastically about how sharks
have evolved over 300 million years,
holding their own in the undersea world,
which by the way he doesn’t like called
“a jungle”.
Old wives’ tales
Out if there has been little research un-
til the sudden push of the last few
years, there have been, as already noted,
plenty of theories and old wives’ tales.
Dr Gilbert, like any expert who has
thought about it, warns violently against
generalisations.
His work with a team of scientists at
Bimini in the Bahamas has done some-
thing to break down one of the older
generalisations about sharks, i.e., that
they don’t use sight to any significant
extent. Important as scent is, research
has proved that even when nostrils are
plugged and deadened with drugs sharks
are able to hunt their food by sight up
to 50 feet.
Perhaps the only generalisation that is
sound was summed up in the words of
an Australian authority on sharks, Sir
Victor Coppleson, the Sydney surgeon
who has sudied them for years, when
he stated in his book “Shark Attack”
that the “risk of attack is infinitesimal”.
Sir Victor, who has spent a large part of
his life talking and writing about sharks
(by no means a specialist, however, he
has also been director of the Post-
graduate Medical Committee in Medi-
cine), can get rather angry about popular
superstitions. In his book he referred to
“the fear of sharks, based apparently on
a primitive cannibalistic fantasy, be-
coming an almost universal phobia”.
Dr Gilbert further complicates any
search for a rigid formula to explain
shark attacks by stressing the individu-
ality of different sharks within a type.
In the shark research field Australia
should be playing a much larger part
than it does. Sir Victor Coppleson’s
work is known throughout the world
and the tagging experiments of Michael
Olsen on the habits of Tasmanian school
sharks were pioneer work in the study
of shark migrations. Other authorities,
like G. P. Whitely and the late D. G.
Stead, have been concerned more with
the study of Australian fishes in general
rather than intensive research on sharks.
What Australia has lacked is any research
centre on the scale of Bimini or that of
the Hawaiian and Californian Institute


at La Jolla, where American scientists
work.
South Africa has been ahead of Aus-
tralia in the field since 1957, when a
fully-equipped oceanarium was establish-
ed at Durban. The Natal beaches can
rival Australia’s and those of the Carib-
bean for being the worst shark danger
centres in the world. In 22 years to 1962
there were 57 attacks along the Natal
beaches, 24 of them fatal.
In Sydney, a Marineland Oceanarium
opened recently at Manly will provide
some research facilities financed by pay-
ing customers. Dr J. M. Thompson,
formerly of the CSIRO, now Director of
the Marineland, plans investigation of
the links between water temperature and
aggressiveness in sharks.
The lack of research is reflected in
the confusion over just what sharks are
dangerous to man. There are about 100
species of sharks in Australian waters.
Of these the whaler is without doubt a
man-eater and responsible for a large
number of attacks. The white pointer
shark has certainly been responsible for
attacks, but after that we move into the
realm of debate. D. G. Stead vigorously
defends the grey nurse against the tag
of “man-eater” and gets sarcastic about
reports against it. But, then, C. P.
Whitely lists it as dangerous along with
the tiger shark. D. G. Stead also differs
over the tiger shark, saying there “is no
evidence of attacks on humans in Aus-
tralian waters”. The controversy over
the hammerheads has already been re-
ferred to. The blue pointer oi mako is
also sometimes classified as man-killer.
About 360 attacks on human beings
have been recorded in Australia, includ-
ing two this season at Wanda, NSW, and
Alinga, SA. Studies of the conditions
surrounding the attacks, begun by Sir
Victor Coppleson before the last war,
have enabled the evolution of a more or
less standard pattern of warnings. Lone
swimmers are in a more dangerous
position than swimmers in a group. The
Middle Harbor attacks in Sydney have
occurred in murky and turbid water.
Fear secretion
A statement by Dr Gilbert on his arri-
val in Australia that research into
whether or not some humans might
exude sweat or a fear-secretion into the
water to attract sharks has attracted
some comment. Fear secretion would
not account for the many surprise
attacks, but different kinds of sweat
might be a factor. The legend that
natives are free from attack is definitely
untrue, as plenty of Torres Strait divers
could testify.
Sir Victor Coppleson has been
primarily responsible for one theory on
shark attack which has virtually passed
into Australian folklore, that of the
“rogue” sharks. In his book he refers
to “a killer which, having experienced
the deadly sport of killing or mauling a
human, goes in search of similar game”.
This theory has even had a paper-
back thriller written around it, “Killer
Shark”, by Paul Crane, which tells in
rather melodramatic language the life
story of “Raj”, a killer-whaler shark
who attacks four humans, killing two.
But Dr Gilbert, asked about the
rogue-shark theory, said that there was
“only slender evidence” for it. Certainly
one of the problems about the theory
which Sir Victor expounds at length in
his book is the absence of any estimate
of shark population. If at any time
during the summer season there are, say,
only two or three sharks in Middle
Harbor and they are spending most of
their lives there, then the theory is much
more plausible. But the fact is nobody
seems to know whether there are three
sharks or three hundred. One South
African scientist has spoken of there
being thousands of sharks to the square
mile.
Another problem about the theory is
the size of the shark’s brain and its ability
to retain data identifying a human with
a special kind of food. Although sharks
have been taught to come to the sound
of a bell for food, when the bell is
stopped for four weeks they have for-
gotten that stimulus. Cases of attacks
separated by short periods of time, cited
by Sir Victor, seem plausible, but those
involving what he admits to be “intervals
of years” come under criticism from
scientists.
Dr Thompson speaks of “most attacks
being directed not at human beings but
at badly-lit objects. D. G. Stead speaks
of those who “thrust” themselves in
front of the shark.
One category of swimmers who might
be said to thrust themselves in front of
sharks are the spear-fishermen. Experts
agree that wounded fish attract sharks by
their erratic movements, secretions and
bleeding from wounds. Dr Gilbert tends
to be a little tart about spear-fishermen’s
confidence in dealing with sharks, and
says “too many skin divers feel they are
learning something about sharks when
all they do is risk their lives”. Certainly
one of the Middle Harbor deaths was
that of a boy spear-fishing, and the only
major attack this season, in November
at Alinga in South Australia, was on a
spear-fisherman. In South Australia the
attack took place despite a black-rubber
suit, sometimes seen as a deterrent to
attacks. A similar attack took place off
the Illawarra coast last February and
then also the fisherman was wearing a
black-rubber suit.
Dr Gilbert’s advice to spear fishermen
is not to rely on knives but rather on a
big club to hit the shark on the snout,
his most, indeed only, tender spot.
Surfboard dangers
surfboard craze has done some-
A thing to increase the prospects of an
attack. Flying over the main Sydney
board beaches like North Cronulla and
Wanda (the scene of a minor attack last
September), an observer can see plenty
of surfies up to half a mile out sitting
on their boards with their legs swinging
over the side. Asked about this, Dr
Gilbert said that arms or legs trailing
from a board could attract a shark
because the erratic blurred movement
could look like a wounded fish.
One of the puzzles, in the sense that
it is unexplained, is the effectiveness of
meshing. The procedure of hanging big
curtain-like nets in rotation off the surf
beaches cuts down the number of sharks
and hence reduces the mathematical
chances of an attack.
Before meshing was introduced in
October, 1937, there was opposition,
mainly, it seems, on the grounds that
there was no real scientific proof that it
would work. But it has, and it is clear
from declining figures in the number of
sharks taken in the nets that the popula-
tion is falling. Meshing has localised
effects, because at Seal Rocks, some little
distance to the north of Newcastle
beaches, which are meshed, the shark
population is as great as ever. Two
attacks took place off Newcastle beaches
after meshing was introduced, and three
recent attacks off Durban beaches have
caused some criticism of meshing. Mesh-
ing is not infallible, as any aerial shark
patrol proves, but the point remains that
if there are fewer sharks there is less
danger of attack. Boats mesh off the
Gold Coast beaches as well as those of
Sydney and Newcastle. But not all Aus-
tralian beaches can be meshed nor can
every beach have an aerial patrol with
a relay system. The metropolitan
beaches where the surf-club members
watch, regular shark patrols fly over-
head and the number of sharks has been
cut back by meshing, are probably as
safe as they can ever be. But on the
hundreds of isolated beaches around the
coastline where holiday-makers or local
residents swim the danger is probably
as great as it ever was. But. then, you
can take comfort in the fact that the
chances of shark attack are “in-
finitesimal”. If you can't, then, as Sir
Victor Coppleson once said, “the only
way to be sure is to keep out of the
water”.

Leave it to the Girls
" The hand that cuts the sandwich ...”
By E. DAVISON
I here are no women Cabinet
Ministers in Australia. The
women are all too busy cutting
sandwiches to take an active part in the
running of the country. ’ The speaker
was an Englishwoman who, softened by
years of State-provided school lunches in
her native land, had received the shock
of her life when —on embarking on
the much advertised Better Life in Aus-
tralia —she discovered that she had to
start each day with the cutting of sand-
wiches for her five children.
Settling down to the new chore with
as good a grace as she could muster,
she soon grew accustomed to it. “I keep
thinking of the beautiful sunshine while
I do it’’ she explained to her familiars.
However, as she found her place in the
new society, she discovered that there
were many calls on her skill—or lack of
it—in the sandwich-making direction.
First of all, the tuckshops. She had
children at both primary and high
school and it soon dawned upon her
that, if she were to make the grade in
her new country, she would have to
help at the school tuckshops So for
four hours each week at each school, she
joined the “girls” and prepared sand-
wiches and rolls and served them to
the children. She found that, unlike
paid workers, there were no seats
provided for the assistants and that these
volunteers —all women who cared for
families of their own, stood for the
entire four hours of their service.
She liked the company and found
than an excellent profit was made by
the ladies. This was regularly handed
over to the men at P & C meetings,
and the Lords of Creation decided what
amenities it should provide. Many of
these amenities, the newcomer thought,
should rightly be the responsibility of
the State and should not be provided
by the exploitation of maternal affection.
Every now and then, the ladies of
the auxiliary committee would timidly
ask for permission to spend money on
perhaps a new power point or even a
new refrigerator, but never, no never,
for such indulgences as chairs, and the
space necessary for them, on which they
could sit during their brief smoko.
The more our badly-trained migrant
became absorbed into the community,
the more calls there came or. her to
“help out" in catering activities. What-
ever club or movement her husband
joined, there was always a ladies’
auxiliary attached, and these auxiliaries
kept the men’s club “financial'’ by their
outside catering activities. One set of
auxiliaries catered week after week at
a sporting arena, toiling over a hot stove
(so very hot in Australia) and running
backwards and forwards at the behest
of all and sundry. As a result, their men
have a marvellous club-room in which
they can relax in their leisure moments.
The ladies are still on the job, of course,
as the men have a scheme for providing
public amenities which is going to take
an awful lot of cash.
In the nick of time, our migrant
stopped her husband joining a move-
ment, the annual dinner of which was
the social event of the season. She dis-
covered that the women’s auxiliary pre-
pared the meal before donning their
glad rags to sit down and eat it. She
felt that"this was where a line had to
be drawn.
And at all the monthly meetings the
ladies —not very well preserved, but hard
working forsooth, which is perhaps all
that is wanted from a woman past a
certain age, handed over large cheques
to the men who beamed and clapped
and passed votes of thanks to the
auxiliary. “And they talk about Stephen
Ward!” stormed our migrant, but only
to her family of course.
By this time she had given a lot of
thought to the position of women in
Australia. Seeking almost in vain to
find women elected to represent the
community, her first snap decision was
that women had no influence in the
running of the country. By attending
these monthly meetings of the various
associations into which she had been
pressed, she found, indeed, that some
ladies did have power, if only indirectly.
The headmaster —hand itching for his
monthly cheque—took great care not to
offend the auxiliary.
No changes likely tc offend the “girls”
(kept too busy to keep up with modern
trends, or maybe even to read a paper)
would be made.
One proposal to teach teenagers the
consequences of promiscuity was dis-
missed. “Just tell them ‘Good’s good
and bad's bad and you see that you
behave yourself' ” said one sood soul
amid applause from her sisters.
In the area in which she lived, our
migrant found one woman actively en-
gaged in public life. Meeting this woman
was, at first, a puzzling and finally a
saddening experience. She was obviously
no brain, certainly unenlightened and at
times even plain stupid. Her secretary
innocently provided the explanation.
“The women's vote keeps Gladys in”
she said, “Gladys works so hard at
catering. Every woman in town engaged
in voluntary work knows what a good
worker she is. She’s never out in front
with the VlPs—she’s always busy getting
the food ready, and washing up.”
A great tribute to Gladys, but not a
qualification to take part in government.
There are many thoughts that strike
someone who has not grown up under
these conditions. Why should a woman
who already has her full share of house-
hold chores be expected to undertake
so many more in her spare time? Always
the answer is: “Your husband (or child-
ren) won't get on if you don't.” A very
potent argument to persuade a loving
wife and mother, but one that engenders
resentment at the system.
Then there is another thought. Fair
wages to caterers have resulted in this
slave labor of women, and probably
caused enormous loss of revenue to the
trade. No, this is not an attack on proper
pay for workers, but a protest against
the exploitation of volunteer labor to
which it has led.
One last thought from our almost
completely absorbed migrant: “If a
woman wants to have a say in this
country (bless it) she doesn't have to
take a degree. Oh no, nothing so easy.
All that she has to do is to spend all
her leisure in the preparation of endless
masses of food. The hand that cuts the
sandwich (indirectly) rules the State.”

Amsterdam —the bargain hunter’s dream
Smart travellers fly to Europe with reliable KLM
and shop without a care at
Amsterdam Airport’s Tax-Free Shopping Centre
Amsterdam is the ideal gateway to
Europe. And Amsterdam Airport’s
Tax-Free Shopping Centre is the largest
in Europe. French perfumes, German
cameras, Swiss watches, Dutch cigars,
rare liqueurs, wines and spirits, tape
recorders, toys and movie projectors —
these are just some of the bargains you
can find there. You can buy a car tax-
free at Ship Side Showroom at Amster-
dam Airport, too. Buy on the spot, or
order in advance when you make your
KLM reservation. Ship Side Showroom
stocks more than a dozen European
car models, from Alfa Romeo to Volks-
wagen, handles all documents and
customs forms. Now read more reasons
why it pays to fly to Europe with
reliable KLM.
1. Amsterdam’s central location makes it
the natural hub for your European tour.
And Amsterdam itself is fun to visit. It has
fine shopping, cuisine, entertainment and
6,000 hotel rooms. It has low price tags on
everything. Getting there (or leaving, if
you must) is simple. Road, rail, air, and
shipping routes all converge on Amsterdam.
2. Diamonds are not expensive in Amster-
dam. Amsterdam artisans have cut and
polished diamonds for centuries. Their
work is famous. Unset diamonds are
especially worth buying, because they are
less expensive in Holland.
3. KLM can meet you with a car at any
of the airports it serves in Europe. But
drive-yourself rental rates at Amsterdam’s
airport are lower than in any other European
country. Your KLM office has full details.

The Italian Bulldog Breed
Musician on the move
By MARGARET CLARKE
Bulldog behavior is supposed to be
peculiar to the British, but just
now there is an Italian in town
who fits the pattern. He is Carlo Zecchi,
who is making his first concert tour of
Australia conducting ABC orchestras in
several States. In February he directs
the eight concerts of the summer festivals
in Sydney and Melbourne.
Zecchi is a lively man of 60, bald and
paunchy, wearing strong glasses. His
speech is picturesque and he makes his
points with anecdotes. Asked how he
establishes contact with an orchestra
that is new to him he is constantly
on the move, from continent to conti-
nent he told the following story:
It was in Brazil. A distraught concert
manager met him upon arrival: the
orchestra was on strike (tearing his hair)
and he could muster up no more than
five players. “Introduce me to the five,”
Zecchi told him and no doubt his
eyes sparkled with the excitement of the
challenge as they sparkled behind his
thick glasses while he told the story.
The bewildered concert manager did so:
two violins, a couple of woodwinds and
a trombone. “Gentlemen,” said Zecchi,
tapping his desk with his baton, “we
begin.” Next morning when Zecchi ar-
rived for the second rehearsal the whole
orchestra was waiting for him
He gave a triumphant smile. “I never
get angry,” he said, “whatever happens.
And I must win an orchestia over from
the very beginning. When a player
makes a mistake I do not point at him
and bellow: ‘You are wrong!’ I do it
quietly, with my face, with my eyes.”
He showed how he did it. “And when
I am wrong 1 say: ‘I made a mistake.
I am sorry. We will begin again.’ I do
not try to blame the players and it is
much better that way.”
Summer vacation
nPHE importance of doing one’s best at
all times, even when on a summer
holiday, he illustrated by another anec-
dote. It happened on the Italian Riviera
where he was spending a summer vaca-
tion. He was asked would he accept an
engagement with the local orchestra:
“they would be honored, etc.” He ac-
cepted and the audience consisted mainly
of holiday-makers, people from all parts
of Europe. During the interval a tap
came at his door and the famous Dutch
conductor, Willem Van Otterloo, walked
in; he had been in the audience. After
the concert Zecchi said to his players:
“You see, you never know who is
listening!”
Zecchi, who began his public career
as a pianist, took up conducting during
the early days of the war. He made his
debut in Switzerland. Soon he was in
great demand and has been conducting
ever since. He finds it more rewarding
and a far greater challenge than piano
playing because he is dealing with hu-
man beings, “with the soul, the heart
and the mind.” He also finds it takes
up a great deal more of his time and
he is no longer able to read literature in
the four or five languages he knows,
or to study philosophy. “A pianist can
tour the world with eight or 10 pro-
grammes,” he pointed out, “but a con-
ductor must constantly be adding to his
repertoire.”
One of his methods of studying a
new work is to write out individual
phrases on scraps of manuscript paper
and sing them to himself while he “con-
ducts” an invisible orchestra. The table
in front of him was covered with these
little scraps of paper. He took a harp
phrase from the table and sang it to me
there and then. Before the night of the
concert he will have the entire score
from memory, working at it by these
means. He always conducts from mem-
ory because he finds that the printed
score on the desk in front of him comes
between him and his musicians.
He has a great range of works in his
repertoire, from Italian baroque to the
moderns such as Malapiero and Dalla-
piccola and through the standard German
classics and romantics. His personal
preference, if he has one, is for the
romantics which he says suit his tem-
perament. He sat down at the piano
and began playing from an album of
Schumann; he played with great tender-
ness and feeling and for a while he forgot
about the time, even though the next
item on the programme was dinner and
our host kept putting his head round
the door.
Zecchi doesn’t believe that any one
country has a monopoly of good musi-
cians and good orchestras, but he has
found that different peoples produce
orchestras with distinctive characteristics.
“Latin orchestras,” he said, “French,
Italian, Spanish, South American, can be
lazy and inattentive at rehearsals, un-
disciplined and unpredictable. But they
always give their best when the perform-
ance comes.”
Germans, on the ether hand, are never
unpredictable and always well-disciplined;
if they play well at the first rehearsal
they can be depended upon to give a
good concert, if not, not. And the Rus-
sians? Zecchi enjoys his visits to Russia
and loves the people there, for he put
his hand inside his shirt and patted his
heart. “They are always responsive,” he
said at length. “We make good music
together.”
Zecchi’s descriptions of his methods
of handling orchestras suggest that he
is a born teacher, a communicator of
ideas. I was not surprised to learn
that he is, in fact, one of the leading
piano teachers in Italy, professor of ad-
vanced piano studies at the Santa Cecilia
Academy in Rome. One of his former
pupils, Romola Costantino, will be soloist
at one of his Sydney concerts, playing
the Chopin Piano Concerto No. 1 in E
Minor.


“Goodbye, George”
A SHORT STORY BY JOHN RICKARD
After some hesitation he dialled the
last digit. Obediently the distant
telephone in the haart of the North
Shore began to ring, and echoed in his
ear. How long had it been since he had
seen George? Two years. No, it must be
three. Incredible! Incredible that they
really had been friends —all those years
at the Law School together, dozing side
bv side through the stifling lectures, pass-
ing ridiculous notes, exchanging
limericks —
“Hullo?”
“Oh—hullo —is that you, George?”
“Yes,” —cautiously.
“It's David Howe here.”
“Howe?” Pause for click. “David!”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“Well . . .” He could visualise George
Woolmer, with his long, serious face,
sorting through his memory file and lift-
ing out the appropriate card. “I thought
you were in England.”
“I was. But I’m back, at least for a
while. I’m here in a show.”
“How long have you been here?”
“Oh, a few months—but I've been in
Melbourne most of that time.”
“And how are you, David?”
“I’m fine.”
“So you really did go on with all that
theatrical business?” -
“Yes, I suppose I did.”
“And have you made a success of it?”
David tried a telephone laugh. “No,
not really.”
George, however, did not respond.
He was perhaps flicking through a diary
of engagements. “We must meet some-
time. How about lunch?”
“Yes, that'd be great.”
“What day suits you?”
“Any day except Wednesday which is
a matinee. What about you?”
“Well . . . this week’s out, I'm afraid.
How would let’s see Thursday
fortnight.”
“Fortnight?” David chuckled. “You
must be a busy man these days.”
“I'm very caught up at the nioment.’
George sounded a trifle huffy. “End of
the financial year, you know.”
“So you’ve kept at the accountancy,
have you?”
“Oh yes,” said George, audibly ruffled,
“I passed my finals at the beginning of
last year.”
“Have you ever felt like finishing
the Law?”
“I might. But I’m so tied up I don’t
see how I can get the time.” Years ago
they had failed together. “How about
you?”
“Never in a thousand years. It was all
a terrible mistake.”
George did not appear to respond to
this either. There was a pause for mutual
breathing
“You’ve moved, haven’t you?” said
David eventually. “I couldn’t remember
your number so I looked it up in the
book. Thank goodness there aren’t many
Woolmers.”
“Yes, I have moved,” said George in
measured tones. “I’m married.”
“Married! Well congratulations.
When was that?”
“Oh, over a year ago now. We got
married just after my finals.”
“Isn’t this dreadful,” said David, smil-
ing a little nervously at walls and furni-
ture, “I’m trying to remember the name
of the girl you were engaged to. lennifer,
wasn’t it? Somehow I thought it was
all—”
“Yes, it was Jennifer,” said George
courteously. “But I am married to
Helen.”
“Helen?” David was stumped. “I don’t
think I know Helen.”
“No,” said George very quietly.
David changed ears desperately.
“Are you married?” said George, re-
turning service.
“No,” said David.
“Not engaged perhaps?”
“No.”
“Nearly everyone I know is. either
married or engaged,” said George pen-
sively. The exception of David seemed
an irritation. “Amazing, isn’t it?”
“I suppose it does tend to happen,”
said David, risking a laugh. “Do you ever
see Henry, by the way?”
“No,” said George with some satis-
faction, “Henry and I have lost touch.”
A spasm of telephonic crackles and
clicks intervened.
“Hullo, hullo, are you there, George?”
“Is that you, David?”
“I thought for a moment we were cut
off,” said David, with a tinge of disap-
pointment. “Well, I mustn’t keep you on
the phone all day. I’ll look forward to
seeing you on Thursday—that is—”
“Thursday fortnight. The twentieth,
according to my calendar.”
“Yes, I’m sure you’re right. I’ll make
a note of it. Where shall we meet?”
“I suggest the GPO corner, Pitt
Street, if that’s alright with you. One
o’clock.”
“Yes indeed,” said David. “I shall look
forward to it,” he added desolately.
“So shall I,” said George quite pleas-
antly. “We’ll have a lot to catch up on.
Thanks so much for ringing, David.”
“Not at all. The twentieth, then.”
“A voice from the dead, as they say,”
continued George, as though at last
warming up to a subject. But added,
“Goodbye.”
“Not too dead I—” George had hung
up. “Goodbye,” he said.
David, with some slight reluctance,
kept the engagement. He stood on the
steps of the GPO watching the bobbing
heads advance across Pitt Street. The re-
nowned prettiest girls in the world were
looking a little tarnished this lunch hour.
It was drizzling, and plastic raincoats and
coverings for hats, together with a de-
fiant variety of umbrellas, herded along
the pedestrian crossings. David discerned
the hatted head of George, who was six
feet tall, framed between the earthly
strata of plastic shoulders and the heaven-
ly strata of technicolor umbrellas. As a
student George had been mildly eccentric
and had been the owner of several ex-

NU-METAL takes up slack and is a worn cyld,
compensator. SAVES expensive rebore, recon-
ditioner job. RESTORES new power, compres-
sion, pep, ziD, top speed. ELIMINATES slack-
ness, oil and petrol waste fumes, piston slap.
NU-METAL consists of a natural expanding
vermiculate mineral lubricant which is refined
and compounded and under motor heat expands
up to 30% its original size. Soon as motor
starts liquid oily expanding Nu- Metal is car-
ried behind rings and grooves, worn main
bearings, diffs, uneven cyld. walls, worn
valves. REPLATES scored and uneven cylinder
walls. NU-METAL expansion then takes place
on these slacking parts with golden expanding
Nu-Metal replating mineral. Slackness oil
pumping, smoking petrol waste, piston slap.
&c., are checked. LOSS of compression, powei
are restored. NU-METAL guaranteed not to
block oil lines. Nu-Metal does not cake or
harden but remains soft, resilient, pliable
plastic allowing engine parts, main bearings
to function properly. Later NU-METAL be-
comes permanent lubricant and cannot harm
finest engine. As early as 5,000 miles piston
slap, cylinder wear. worn main bearing, difs
and gears start. The power is no longer per-
fectly sealed, slackness develops and petrol
and oil dilution endangers proper lubrication,
eventually the engine starts to smoke.
The usual high price oil and petrol additives
do not remove the trouble. Eventually you
have to pay and pay for the waste In oil and
petrol and expensive parts for overhaul. Super
Nu-Metal expansion compensates for both ring
and cyl., main bearings, diffs, gears, wear.
Petrol mileage jumps. Oil consumption is cut.
New car zin and power restored up to 25,000
miles, with’ similar repeats. Nu-Metal quickly
pays for itself. Nu-Metal is packed in separate
tubes for each cyld. and oil sump. Not in one
big tube. No guess work installing quantities.
For reconditioning any size engine including
motor car. motor bikes, trucks, standing en-
gines. lawn mowers. The effectiveness of Nu-
Metal is sometimes limited by gummed up
piston rings, oil accruing carbon in compres-
sion chamber. This condition is likely to be
found in any engine which has seen long ser-
vice and above ordinary wear and where gum
and carbon deposits are preventing the rings
from expanding freely and the pistons and
valves riding up and down freely. Nu-Metal
is thus unable by such wiping effect to get the
support it needs. In such cases it is recom-
mended before using Nu-Metal to add DIS-
SOLVO super tune purging decoking compres-

cellent umbrellas But it had usually re-
quired a tempest of a major order to
induce him to unfurl the umbrella he
was carrying. David could see that this
was one characteristic at least that had
remained with him.
Observing that remote face approach-
ing him, David wondered: what on earth
is friendship? Had George been a friend?
They had shared some kind of student
bonhomie. They had met at lectures,
chatted over coffee, studied together in
the library, spent Sundays together with
other friends at the beach. They had
shared a sense of humor—or had be-
lieved that they had. He remembered
several of their mythical characters, the
most outlandish being an irascible old
judge who had delighted in indecent
language in court, and who had person-
ally administered the las to those found
guilty of contempt of court . . .
George had seen him.
“How’s the big financier?” said David,
shaking hands.
“Well, thank you. How's the brilliant
actor?” replied George.
This was at least a promising start.
George suggested one of the cellar restau-
rants of recent vogue, and David was
agreeable. They managed a disjointed
conversation on their way down the block
and found themselves in the queue at
the counter.
“We must come and see the show
you’re in,” said George generously.
“What’s it called?”
They were momentarily halted by a
choice of food. George knew exactly
what he wanted; David prattled on a
little about the show. “It’s what they
call clean and colorful. You know, for
the whole family.”
George nodded seriously. “You’ll have
some claret? If you’d like to find a table
I'll follow up.”
The restaurant was crowded, and it
was impossible to find a table for two.
David settled for the end of a long, half-
occupied table. The smart young people
were here in force, plus a sprinkling of
towning matrons.
George arrived. “Yes, I’d like to see
your show. I’m afraid that Helen and I
don’t get to the theatre as much as we
used to.”
“Let me know when you’re planning
to come.”
“1 don’t suppose you could fix us
with some complimentaries?” said
George.
Irritated, David was about to explain
the impossibility of this, when two young
men bore down on them. They were ac-
quaintances of George: young men with
bright North Shore faces, and no doubt
bright cars and prospects to match.
George suggested they join them; by this
time in fact they had. Conversation
ricocheted from recent weddings to ski-
ing holidays, friends going abroad, and
friends returned. On this latter count
David was briefly ushered into the dia-
logue; but when the conversation moved
on to new car models he was, so to
speak, ushered out again.
“A quarter to two!” exclaimed George.
“I’ll have to make a dash, I’m afraid.”
They followed George out into the
regions of light. The other two passed
jovial remarks and departed.
George hovered for a moment. “Well,
David, so sorry we didn’t have more time
to chat. Anyway, next time we mustn’t
let it go as long.” He waved his umbrella
rather jauntily as he strode off down
the street.
It was two months later that George
rang David.
“Hullo? It’s George here. George
Woolmer.”
“Oh yes, George. I’ve been meaning
to ring you. How are things?”
“Not too bad. Look, I’ll tell you why
I rang. I’ve been wanting to fix a night
for you to come up and have dinner
with us. I don’t think you’ve met Helen,
have you?”
“No, as a matter of fact, I haven’t.”
“Well now, how would Friday night
suit you?”
“I’m afraid week nights are out for
me, George. That’s when the show’s on,
you know.”
George seemed taken aback. “Oh, I
hadn’t realised . . .” Enlightenment dawn-
ed. “That means Sunday is your only
free night of the week.” This, it would
seem, was decidedly off-putting.
“You’re right. That’s the penalty for
the show going on all the time.”
“Now let’s see,” muttered George.
There were obviously great difficulties.
“This Sunday is out because we're going
to Helen’s people. And the following
Sunday we’ll be away at Terrigal. How
about —well, Sunday the 25th?”
Zemmima laughed

“George, I’d love to. But I won’t be
here on Sunday the 25th. Our show
closes Saturday week here and we’re off
to Brisbane the following Monday.”
There was a pause.
“My goodness,” George said finally,
“you are a difficult person to get hold
of.”
“Aren’t I?” said David, rather wishing
to terminate the conversation.
“We haven’t seen the show yet,”
George confessed. “We’ve been meaning
to, but with one thing and another . .
“Of course. It’s not a show I’d force
my friends to see anyway.”
“Oh, we’ve wanted to see it. Helen was
most interested. But now with Terrigal
coming up I don’t quite see how we can
make it . . .”
“Yes, I know. It’s incredible how the
time flies.”
“Isn’t it? It doesn’t seem that long
since we were slaving away at Law
School. By the way, do you remember
that poor old lecturer, Forsyte?”
“The one who was always saying, ‘Be
that as it may’?”
“Yes. Well he fell under a train, you
know. Wynyard I think it was. Or it
might have been St James.”
“I’m sorry to hear that,” said David,
with laughter hovering in his throat.
There was a pause.
“Well I must see you before you set
off again,” said George, with some effort.
“How about if we meet for lunch?”
“That’s a good idea.” David was aware
of irony creeping into his voice.
“Now let’s see. I’m very busy at the
moment. But perhaps if I can arrange
things—”
“Look, George, if you’re busy better
let the whole thing slide this time. I’ll be
passing through Sydney again in a couple
of months We car make a date of it
then’’
“Actually,” sighed George with evident
relief, “I think that would be a good idea.
Will 1 leave it to you to ring me when
you’re back in town?”
“Yes, of course,” said David firmly.
They both waited. Was it time to say
goodbye?
“Do you remember the judge?” David
said after what seemed a large silence.
“The judge?”
“Yes.” He turned his voice into a
rasping croak. “I will now don the black
cap and read the death sentence. The
mob up in Macquarie Street may let you
off, boy, but, my God, it still makes
bloody good reading, ha ha.”
George laughed. “Yes, I remember.”
But another pause threatened.
“Must go now,” said David. “I've got
a ferry to catch in a few minutes.”
“Well, goodbye, David. I'll expect to
hear from you.”
“Goodbye, George.”


OVERSEAS
A View of the Canal
Poverty , crime and nationalism in Panama
By GEORGE FARWELL
Coming to Panama City, from the
Pacific side, you feel long before
the ship berths this is no normal
port. There are strange tensions; due
perhaps to the humid air, or the long
tropical voyage without land. Even in the
Dry Season you begin to sweat here.
Stark, rocky islands hover like mirages
above the slack, mud-brown waters of the
Gulf of Panama. A horseshoe of barren
mountains ebbs away north towards the
Costa Rican border, southward to Colum-
bia. Here and there volcanic peaks and
cones break the high skyline. Dark jungle
spills down steep hills to the edges of
Balboa Harbor.
The land has a volcanic air.
On the ship's public address system,
even a year ago, we heard repeatedly:
“Passengers are advised to leave their
valuables on board. Lock your cabins.
Don’t go ashore with wristwatches, rings,
jewellery. Keep to the main streets of
the city.”
Such warnings added no little zest to
going ashore. Balboa might look a little
like Sydney, with its naval dockyard,
busy tugs and wharves; but its values,
clearly, are not suburbia. Sophisticates
aboard hinted of lavish nightclubs, odd
floor shows, all-night bars, furtive enter-
tainments equalling Port Said. Anything
goes in Panama City; we all know that.
My own first impressions were somewhat
different.
Beyond the wharf’s iron gates, where
armed US police scrutinised us casually
as we passed through, a small, low-slung
overcrowded bus offered a ten cent ride
downtown. It seemed less conspicuous
than the expensive, flashy taxicabs. The
sweating Panamanian bus driver, with
his genial bandit’s face, drove furiously
through the speeding traffic. Maybe the
colored picture of the Virgin above
his windshield gave him protection. This,
I felt, was just how a tropical city
ought to look. The broad bitumen
traffic lanes ran between wide lawns
with flowering hibiscus and frangipani
on either side, palm trees, handsome
apartment blocks of white stone, modern
banks, a post office with classical portico
and columns. Someone pointed out the
huge, air-conditioned barn of a store
where Canal workers could buy every-
thing from canned foods to home furnish-
ings and hardware at concession prices.
But this was still Balboa; the Canal
Zone, under American control. There
had to be strong inducements for US
nationals to live in equatorial Panama.
Downtown the city wears a different air.
It is a jumbled, noisy, crowded city,
jarring in its restlessness. Dense traffic
snarls at every intersection; pedestrians
make desperate sorties, brakes squeal and
people of all nations saunter down the
narrow sidewalks. It is a city where
streets fork abruptly, lead into squalor.
Along one block are decaying timber
buildings, tenements and crowded gar-
bage-littered alleys; the next has modern
glass-fronted dress shops, Indian curio
stores, or cafes offering good or indif-
ferent Chinese, American or Spanish
meals, and frequent garish bars with
batwing doors. Bootblacks, sellers of
lottery tickets, hawkers accost you; taxi-
drivers promise you alleged bargain rates
for scenic tours of visits to the Old City
which Morgan the British pirate burned
down more than two centuries ago. A
thrill for antipodean tourists, that five-
dollar trip. Especially when the driver
calls his henchmen over, demanding
treble the fare.
The entire city seems geared to huck-
stering of various kinds.
“I guess it’s tough on the Panaman-
ians,” a US sergeant told us in the cele-
brated Charlie’s Bar at the corner of
Calle K and Central. “There’s not much
work around. Nearly a million battling
here for a living. No industries. By hell,
I wouldn’t stay here one week, if our
pay and conditions weren’t good.”
Talking was not so easy in that large,
brassy bar, with its fluorescent lighting,
juke boxes, tenpin bowls. Every few
minutes another hawker stood beside you;
mostly teenage youths, even small boys,
They offered all manner of things for
sale; plastic toys, most of them made in
Japan, live birds, mongrel puppies,
combs, bootlaces, cigarettes at suspici-
ously cut rates, smuggled watches, any-
thing to wheedle a few cents from the
beer-soaked change on the bar. These
sallow-faced boys, bare of foot, with old
shrewd eyes were nudging you constantly.


They made you feel guilty. Those old
men’s eyes. Worse still, they made you
feel a tourist. There is nothing worse
than feeling a tourist in Latin America;
or in any other country where color is
the decisive factor. Throughout the
Caribbean, in Central America, back in
Tahiti, the issue these days is not mere
money, nor caste nor the freedom to
travel. It is color. This is the ultimate
blackmail.
Useless to say in Panama you are not
rich. Here, by comparison, all travellers
are rich. You are a gringo, too. Once
the gringo was an American. Now he is
all people with a special skin. Especially
those who pass through the Canal; the
visitors from elegant cruise ships, the
women fingering Guatamalan fabrics or
imported Indian silks in downtown stores.
We happened to arrive in Panama just
before Christmas time. A bad period, so
the US sergeant said.
“These Panamanian boys all have
mothers,” he said, ordering another
Scotch and orange cordial. “They want
to grab themselves Christmas gifts. Just
for their starving mothers, I guess. They
don’t care a hoot in hell who pays.”
It was a good Christmas, according to
the local papers.
Between December 14 and 30, the
Panama-American reported, 122 cases
of theft were listed by the National
Department of Investigation, as well as
17 robberies and five cases of fraud.
A few months later, when my wife and
I returned via Mexico and Costa Rica
to await a ship home, we found the Pana-
manian Government much troubled by
the undertow of violence that was scar-
ing visitors away. The beautiful young
head of the Panama Tourist Institute,
Senorita Irma Arango, announced that
the National Guard was to be called in.
Armed troopers were to set up control
points to offset “the menace of hold-ups
and other crimes.”
“The National Guard will patrol well-
known danger spots at the suggestion of
the Tourist Institute,” she said.
Vice, poverty, hate
\ T this stage the prevailing mood was
not political. There were undertones,
of course. The virus spread from poverty,
slums, organised vice. And from it bred
the bacilli of Communism, Castroism
and nationalistic hate.
Several times, walking Panama streets
by night, we were stopped by green
uniformed members of the National
Guard. “Please do not go down that
street,” one would say in excellent Eng-
lish. “We cannot stop you, if you wish.
It is not advised.”
Once, attracted by a row of small,
lamplit stores, we met four of these men,
grouped together on the sidewalk. Revol-
ver butts stuck from their holsters. Each
had a rifle slung over his shoulder.
“It is better you go back that way,”
the sergeant in charge said, pointing to-
wards a well-lit avenue dominated by the
ultramodern Pan-American building.
Now that, too, has been burnt down in
the recent riots.
Panama is really two cities. One is on
top of Balboa Heights, with fine homes
built around the Administration block
and the soaring white Panama Hilton
Hotel, where the doorman wears gold
braid on his tunic, superbly dressed
women drink martinis with Latins in
tropical whites, where the floor shows
are imported from New York and its
casino stays open till breakfast time.
The other sprawls out for miles at sea
level, humid and stifling, with two thirds
of the State’s million-plus population
jammed within its cramped lanes and
alleys.
Few Europeans ever see that seething
sub-world. It is unwise to try. I had one
■brief glimpse only, travelling on a round-
about route by bus from Balboa
docks to town. In many thoroughfares
there is hardly room for two vehicles
to pass; sweating men milled in and out
of shabby bars from which juke boxes
blared; young toughs lounged around
dark alleyways; beyond lighted, street-
level windows you saw families crowded
in bare, boxlike rooms, mostly reduced to
singlets and petticoats. Everywhere the
bus went there was uproar. A cacophony
of voices, blaring radios, car horns that
vibrated on the eardrums.
It was a frightening vision of the pop-
ulation explosion now haunting Latin
America.
What can be done? There is no easy
solution; if any at all.
We met Americans who were even
more concerned about the future than
the government itself; more responsibly
so. Without revenue from the Canal,
Panama could well rank as the world’s
poorest nation. It produces little; mainly
pineapples and bananas, with a few small-
scale industries turning out furniture,
shoes, pottery and beer. The big employer
is the Canal, which has some 10,000 on
its payroll, including American tech-
nicians.
The State of Panama is something of
a bastard nation. It was created out of
nothing when Theodore Roosevelt’s
Government acquired a 100-year lease on
a coast-to-coast strip 50 miles wide back
in 1903. Maybe the politics of the time
were not all they should have been. To
acquire this land a revolution against the
Colombian Government was engineered
and a new State created. Hitherto there
was no such being as a Panamanian.
Nowadays all that unites this unhappy
population—6s per cent mestizos, 13
per cent Negroes, 11 per cent of mixed
Spanish blood—is an inspired antipathy
to the American owners of the Canal.
The Americans have a dilemma here.
To operate the Canal they must have
executives and engineers brought from
the United States; and armed forces to
protect it. Without artificially high living
standards, they could not attract the men
required. But the luxury homes and
apartment blocks hardly appeal to the
locals; nor do the reduced, duty-free
prices for employees within the Canal
Zone. During my stay in the Republic,
a visiting member of the US Senate
Foreign Relations Committee warned
Washington of the dangers this double
standard could create in Panama. Maybe
he had President Kennedy’s Peace Corps
standards in the back of his mind. At all
events, the situation he foresaw has come
about.
Mighty feat of engineering
you have only to live there to
realise the global importance of
keeping open the Canal.
Since life in Panama City was too un-
easily picturesque, we moved to quieter
Colon, finding a hotel room with a bal-
cony overlooking the Atlantic end of the
Canal.
Day and night for three weeks we
watched the ships move through. It was
an unending stream, flying almost every
known national flag. Sometimes a dozen
or more were anchored inside the ten-
mile breakwater that reached out to the
green Caribbean. At twenty minute inter-
vals yet another vessel moved through
the last of the great locks at Cristobal.
There were white luxury liners making
for California, the West Indies, South
American ports; Japanese cargo vessels
with names painted on their hulls for
safe passage through Chinese Communist
waters; rusting and black-hulled freigh-
ters trailing the Liberian or Panamanian
flags; US warships transferring from
Pacific or Atlantic commands; and
tankers, tankers galore. Every fourth or
fifth vessel seemed to be a tanker.
If ever the Canal were closed to the
4,000 or more vessels now using it each
year, the dislocation to world trade would
be critical.
It is a mighty engineering feat, this
Canal; especially in the context of its
time. Built between 1903 and the out-
break of World War I, without the tech-
niques and machinery we know today,
this long “ditch” through equatorial
jungle is something to admire as you
make the eight-hour passage from one
ocean to another. A deep channel
had to be carved through the rocky
ranges. Three locks on the Pacific
side, two on the Atlantic, lift great
ocean - going vessels 85 feet above

sea level. At that height you cruise
through the magnificent Lake Gatun,
where miles of placid, man-made waters
reach back into the flooded valleys where
once some 50,000 men died of malaria
and yellow fever.
Today you sleep without the sound of
one mosquito in what used to be a fever-
haunted hell to rival Devil's Island, where
few Europeans had lived since the Span-
ish Conquest, where Paul Gauguin once
sweated and toiled alongside desperate
nationals to clear jungle for de Lesseps’s
unsuccessful bid to create a second Suez
for France. Only the battle against pov-
erty remains unsolved.
From that hotel balcony I watched
daily one instance of this struggle. Be-
yond the duty-free liquor store for Canal
employees, across the railway line where
diesel locos shunting freight cars shatter-
ed the pre-dawn quiet, was a pathetic
little settlement. Some two hundred West
Indians lived down there. Their homes
were made of packing cases, driftwood,
old iron. A few rough-adzed canoes were
beached on the muddy shore, though I
never saw men bring home more than a
few, undersized fish each morning. Two
tattered breadfruit trees, transplanted
from Trinidad, had their green fruit
plundered long before they grew ripe.
Their water supply consisted of one tap.
Of course, these Negro families had no
right living there. They were squatters.
It was Canal Zone property, inside the
eight-foot steel and wire fence dividing
it from Panamanian territory. They were
allowed to stay simply because Colon’s
back streets and tenements were over-
crowded.
Behind this derelict camp slender
coconut palms leaned gracefully against
the brilliance of the Caribbean, as if
from the romantic cover of a tourist
brochure.
That one tap w'as never shut off.
Attached to a five foot steel pipe in the
ground, it drew people continually from
the first early workers to the last dead-
beat feeling his drunken way through
tall weeds and grass by night. Elderly
Negroes washed their bodies here; young
bucks shaved; satin-skinned girls rinsed
their hair beneath its thin flow, washed
underwear and blouses; heavy-bodied
women carried tin basins, battered jugs,
washbowls to and fro; fish were cleaned
here, vegetables pared and cleaned;
children sluiced themselves down after
swimming in the canal; stray dogs licked
up the slops. It was like the village well,
for idle groups gossiped around it, lean
Negro lads chiacked their girlfriends and
old men with withered limbs scrubbed
their dentures and eased a thirst.
Mostly these people seemed per-
petually unemployed. Nor did most of
the kids go to school.
The one communal interest was to
watch teenage lads, stripped to swimming
trunks, sparring and fighting barefisted
on the beach. It was as if this were the
one hope of escape from a drifting
community. The ambitions of prize-
fighters who knew no other way of reach-
ing some kind of livelihood. They were
tough, these quick-footed boys; and
sometimes took angry punishment.
The shabby, rundown colonial style
hotel had a queer atmosphere that
puzzled us at first. It is the only place
where I have ever seen chambermaids
making and remaking beds all night.
We heard the click of high-heels along
the stone-flagged corridors all night. Next
door, the Bar Manhattan kept its juke
box going till dawn, and the girls who
smiled professionally from the high stools
received cashable tokens in proportion
to how much their transient men friends
drank. They were kindly girls. We came
to know some of them well, though con-
versation in Spanish was difficult. Their
life stories were not unusual. They hid
their weariness and boredom well when
some new roving tourist or seaman
drifted in through the gay swing door.
What other living was there in jobless
Colon?
Canal outmoded?
Tt was the West Indians especially who
brought some sad gaiety to this humid
town. When we arrived, the annual
fiesta was getting under way. Night after
night the drums throbbed in back streets,
tiny parks and wooden tenements. The
hot air pulsed with the primitive, tropic
rhythm of those drums, and sometimes
a procession of rapt Negroes danced
calypso-fashion through the streets.
I shall always remember Colon by
those drums. It was the last link with
home of a people whose fathers had
left the Caribbean in search of work
that, once the Canal was built, became
just one more mirage.
There was less violence here; or so
it seemed last year. This month's rioting
reveals that little is needed to set the
time fuse of discontent alight. But what
is there for these people if the Canal
ceases to offer at least some token
promise of employment?
Already engineers are saying the
present canal is too small, outmoded,
unable to give passage to outsize modern
tankers and US aircraft carriers. They
want to deepen the existing channel at
what would be an astronomical cost.
Another alternative is now offering.
Surveys have already been made for a
new sea-level canal through the Isthmus
farther north.
For the bankrupt Republic of Panama
the results would be catastrophic. No
one is more aware of them than Presi-
dent Chiari, now struggling to face both
ways at once.


A Lot Of
Hot Air
Not much could be done about it, once.
Now it is being moved by the TON.
People have really grown to like fresh
air. They all want better air conditions
free from smoke, odours and stuffi-
ness. Ever since man developed the art
of trapping air in rooms, things seem to
have got out of hand. A good cool
draught is usually a welcome phrase in
either shade of meaning and a controlled,
forced air draught through any building
will usually lower temperatures, remove
all stale air, smoke, cooking odours and
the like and replace continuously with
clean, filtered air. The wonderful thing
is that it can be done for such small
cost.

Portrait of a Patriarch
Papal Caesarism was never popular
From LESLIE FINER in Athens
The meeting in Jerusalem between
Pope Paul and the head of the
Eastern Orthodox Church in Istan-
bul, Patriarch Athinagoras, is a land-
mark in the annals of Christianity.
For Athinagoras, in his 77th year, the
meeting fulfils a dream. The man whom
some have described as “the greatest
Christian figure of our age” has always
insisted in the face of entrenched
prejudice that unity of the churches is
the only way to achieve a united front
in the return to what he calls “the
essence of Christianity”.
Only a man of exceptional personal
magnetism could hope to begin a labor
as formidable as the repair of a schism
between the Catholic and the Orthodox
Churches which is now over a thousand
years old, and which has been deepened
meantime by the eroding influences of
what Athinagoras has called “misunder-
standings, hatreds, proselytisation and
propaganda”.
The Patriarch in Istanbul is a native
of Epirus in Northern Greece, where
he was christened Matthew Spirou, son
of a doctor in the village of Tsaraplana.
His early theological training was con-
ventional enough; the theological school
at the old Byzantine centre of Halkis,
a deaconship in 1910, a period of hunger
and privation in Salonika after the
Balkan wars, a year of monastic seclusion
on Mount Athos and the first positive
step towards the summit when, in 1919,
at the age of 33, he was recommended
to Archbishop Metaxakis in Athens as
a young deacon of ability and no special
affiliations in the intense church politics
of the time.
His success on the Archbishop’s staff
in Athens won him an unusually early
election as Bishop of Corfu three years
later.
It was in that easy-going, green Greek
island that Athinagoras began to display
the qualities of industry in social causes
and lack of conventionality in religious
practice which make him a primate
unlike others. In Corfu the main church
of Saint Spiridon still contains a
memorial to his tolerance of the native
musical tradition —the only harmonium
extant in a Greek Orthodox church. In
Corfu he also introduced an innovation
which he was able to justify by his
greater learning; when shocked con-
servatives protested against the intro-
duction of chairs into the traditionally
empty spaces of a Greek church, Athina-
goras pointed out that the original
Byzantine service refers to the act of
standing up by the the congregants—-
presumably from a sitting position.
He was appointed Archbishop in the
United States in 1930. During his 18
years as head of the Greek Orthodox
community there, Athinagoras became a
national figure. The Greeks of America
still speak of his success in moderating
community squabbles and bringing
material aid to needy co-religionists in
times of depression. He continued to be
unconventional —as when he set a
precedent by taking the service at an
Anglican church. <
But he was conventional enough when
it suited his purpose. Unlike other
Orthodox priests in America, he did noi
abandon his black robes and white
beard. Those who have seen his six-foot
four-inch figure sailing down Fifth
Avenue, stopping occasionally to dis-
tribute sweets to a small boy or biblically
imposing benedictions on passing Greeks,
say that the theatricality of his appear-
ance verged on the unreal.
Since his transfer in 1948 to the
tradition-bound seclusion of the Phanar
as titular head of the Orthodox Church,
the Patriarch, often suspected and harried
by the Orthodox flock as much as by the
Turks, has been criticised for continuing
to exercise the qualities of theatricality
and overt worldliness which his stay in
America encouraged. He smokes and
drinks in moderation. The Spartan sur-
roundings of his quarters in the Phanar
are often the setting for far from Spartan

dinner parties at which the host can
converse with his guests in Greek,
English, French, Turkish, and even in

He uses the telephone and listens to
the radio —both traditionally forbidden
for a Patriarch. Complaints are also
heard about his occasional outbursts of
temper and his errors of judgment in
small matters.
The Greeks of Istanbul suspect his
Turkish sympathies and are not appeased
by his habitual answer to the accusation
of being unduly pro-Turkish: “I am not
pro-Turkish, I am Turkish"— a joking
reference to his formal national status.
Nobody however has ever doubted the
Patriarch’s sense of mission or his
practical gifts in fulfilling it. The World
Council of Churches, in the post-war
formation of which Athinagoras was a
leading spirit, has already established a
powerful point of contact between the
Orthodox and Protestant branches of
Christianity.
Conflict of Temperament
HThe rapprochement with Roman
Catholicism presents much thornier
problems. The dogmatic differences—■
even the crucial obstacle of Papal in-
fallibility—are not thought by church-
men to be insuperable or even of first
importance. The basic conflict between
the two Churches is one of temperament;
in its dogma as well as in its organisation
the Roman Church expresses a spirit of
conformity and discipline which is totally
foreign to the Eastern individualist tinge
of democracy.
Papal Caesarism and the cult of
absolute power were never popular with
the Eastern Christians. And just as they
could never swallow the claim of Papal
infallibility, so Orthodox Christians have
never subscribed to the power system of
the Catholic Church in which the Pope
is the apex of all authority.
Each of the dozen Orthodox Churches
in the world is master of its own affairs
and each bishop within those churches
is the undisputed ruler of his own
domain. Even the Patriarch himself is
a bishop just like the others, recognised
as first among equals for historical
reasons alone.
When Athinagoras organised the con-
gress of all the Orthodox Churches in
Rhodes in 1961, it was the first time
they had met to exchange views for
seven centuries.
If the power system of the Orthodox
Church were similar to that of Rome,
the meeting of Athinagoras and Pope
Paul could be the starting point for an
unobstructed progress towards unity. As
it is, it can only be the tentative over-
ture to a process which will have to over-
come the fears and prejudices of the
many scattered constituent elements of
Orthodox Christianity. (ofns)


FORUM
Editors in Prison
A world round-up
By ROHAN RIVETT
r A great many journalists, perhaps a
majority, enter the profession be-
cause they have strong views. In-
evitably, these men, acquiring informa-
tion and knowledge from many sources,
learn more of the shortcomings of those
in power than other citizens. Equally
surely they are more annoyed, more
anxious to right the wrong. In publicis-
ing or giving avenues for publicising
what is wrong in the administration of
a Minister or a departmental head they
inevitably create bitter enmity among
those both at the top and lower down
■—who fear exposure of their incapacity,
their bias, their corruption or short-
sightedness. So the eternal war between
executive and administrators on one side
and newspapermen on the other flares
up yet again. Today it may be in
Karachi, between a reformist general and
a Press which often formerly backed the
previous Government; equally it may be
in Katoomba, Kansas City or Killarney
between the local editor and the town
council; or it may be, as it was from
December until his illness and resigna-
tion in October, between a British Prime
Minister and a large section of the
world’s strongest national Press that
of Fleet Street.
Before we turn to the dramas, trage-
dies, heroism and supersensitivity that
has shaken relations between Govern-
ment and Press in most of the emergent
countries of Africa and Asia, let us look
for the moment at the war which broke
out undeclared but unmistakable
between half Britain's national Press and
the Macmillan Ministry in the first nine
months of this year. You will remember
the Government’s anger not without
strong justification in retrospect at
the allegations, suggestions and implica-
tions of certain articles published in
Fleet Street during and after the Vas-
sal spy episode. The Government was
severely embarrassed and particularly
furious at the attacks made on two Mini-
sters, including the popular, virile and
shrewd Lord Carrington, until recently
British High Commissioner in Canberra.
In turn the Government prosecuted two
journalists. They were asked in court to
disclose their sources of information for

the ABC.
stor ies they published about Vassal, his
habits, doings and friends. Both men
a "Daily Mail” reporter and an older and
widely respected “Daily Sketch” journa-
list—adhered to the basic code of journa-
lists Thev refused to disclose their
sources even when the judge indicated
he would be forced under the law to
commit them to gaol. One served three
months, the other six months. The Press
knew that one man was protecting an
official who had been a good friend
of the Press, normally a man of the
highest integrity whose career and family
would be desperately damaged if his
name was disclosed. Therefore with great
vigor and unanimity the bulk of Britain’s
popular papers and at least two of the
great prestige newspapers demanded the
release of the journalists. The Govern-
ment refused and the sniping and guerril-
la actions which had been developing heat
for months burst into the bonfire of the
Profumo-Keeler disclosures and all the
subsequent drama and washing of dirty
linen. It may not have precipitated
Harold Macmillan’s illness and resigna-
tion but it certainly cannot have helped
him in a year when he suffered rebuff
after rebuff both abroad and from the
electors at home.
Now if this sort of thing can happen
in the most sophisticated, adult and
generally tolerant of all the democracies,
how much more inevitable is it in the
brand new nations that now number
40 or 50 in the UN roll-call? In a quite
astounding number of cases, no real
freedom of the Press has ever existed in
these countries either under the former
European colonialist regime or under
the nationalist militants who came into
power after independence was granted.
Here, these communities lose daily be-
cause there is no one to expose the short-
comings of government, or to pose com-
munity questions. This is a loss but en-
tirely predictable and, indeed, inevitable
in the light of history and of the slow
development of education in most of
these countries until the past decade.
However, tragedy stalks in several
other lands where, in the first fine flush
of emancipation and self-rule, a healthy,
vigorous, dedicated national Press had
been in the forefront of the liberation
struggle. One could name here at this
moment from personal acquaintance 30,
40 or possibly 50 intelligent, capable,
fiercely patriotic editors, proprietors and
influential journalists in countries like
Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, Pakistan
and Ceylon who rate among the first
leaders in thought and community ser-
vice in their nations. Almost without
exception these men played a major role
in seeking and sometimes pushing
through the best measures and develop-
ments taken by their governments in the
first decade of independence after the
First World War. But over the past seven
or eight years, and particularly since
1960, the tide has ebbed and then almost
reversed itself. Not one of those journa-
lists today still remains with a paper
where he can tell the truth and express
views about his administration’s acts or
failures to act. In Djakarta, Rangoon,
Bangkok, Colombo and in both West
and East Pakistan these men have been
gaoled, or their papers have been closed
down or Government stooges giving ser-
vile propaganda service to their dictators
or elected ministers have taken over the
main organs of the Press. Let us look
for a moment at a few of the most
spectacular samples of this sort of thing
in Asia.

1950, when Dutch dominance ended,
and perhaps 1957 some ot tne liveliest,
most reform-mindea and enthusiastic
national newspapers in any of the
emergent nations. At one stage in the
mid-fifties, Djakarta alone had seventeen
daily papers, expressing every viewpoint
from that of Moscow and Peking on one
fringe to that of extremely reactionary
millionaire tycoons on the other extreme.
Then that extremely self-impressed
potentate, President Soekarno began to
react very sharply to any suggestions
that at any time he or any of his chosen
lieutenants could be less omniscient than
the Deity. A brilliant and intensely
patriotic editor was dispossessed of his
job and confined to his house under
arrest and his paper was taken over
by more amenable men with the
“correct” understanding of President
Soekarno's immaculate goodness.
Quickly, at a developing tempo, in-
dependent or opposition papers were
silenced. The quiet threat, the open
closedown, the subtle takeover by
Government-selected appointees went on
rapidly from 1959. By 1962 the last
pretences had totally disappeared.
Soekarno's Press today has appreciably
less freedom, less right to publish in-
formation and vastly less right to
criticise in the public interest than the
great Communist propaganda organs of
Moscow and Peking.
In Burma the Press again has seen
its freedom steadily contracted. The Ne
Win regime, early this year, dismissed
its Vice-Premier, the only thinking and
courageous liberal in the Cabinet. With
his disappearance, the arrest, bullying
and gagging of the active and indepen-
dent Rangoon Press went ahead at full
steam. Today no newspaper in Burma,
whether published in Burmese, Chinese
or English, dares to publish facts em-
barrassing to the Government All this
has happened since March. All the in-
dications suggest that Genera! Ne Win
is as totalitarian-minded as Soekarno.
By part contrast, in Pakistan there
are very much two sides to the medal.
The Pakistan Press, with a handful of
fine exceptions, was corrupt, intemperate
and irresponsible. Most of the principal
papers were closely linked with one or
other faction of the politicos whom
General Ayoub Khan drove out or pro-
secuted when his military regime took
over. Today some fine editors, pro-
prietors and journalists are fighting for
a restoration of freedom in East and
West Pakistan. The public of East
Pakistan, for political reasons and
because of its resentment of dominance
from West Pakistan, is sympathetic to
these editors but in the West the
notorious shortcomings of papers in the
past have alienated support for the Press.
In Ceylon the Government of Mrs
Bandranaike has seven times brought
forward bills to nationalise the Press
and convert it, in effect, into a great
extension of the Government Printing
Office. Fortunately the Opposition
politicians and divisions within the
Government majority have thus far pre-
vented the axe from falling but in
Colombo today newspapers live pre-
cariously.
The future course of political develop-
ment in Africa may well hinge on
whether any real or partial freedom
is left to the Press as the nationalist
leaders assume full authority in Kenya,
Tanganyika, Nyasaland, Uganda. In
Ghana, which until last year had one of
the finest papers in the continent, the
battle has been temporarily lost. The
infallibility of a N’Krumah must not
be questioned.

Supersonics v Economics
The Qantas option
By PETER NELSON
Qantas last week reserved positions
for four Anglo-French Concordes
and six US supersonic aircraft.
In a few years from now we might be
able to fly from Sydney to London in
eleven hours including stops, but accord-
ing to the sun we will only have taken
one hour; this will surely be an unner-
ving yet exhilarating experience, for
those who can afford it.
The Concorde supersonic airliner, the
product of an Anglo-French consortium,
is already past the early drawing-board
stage and reports indicate that the initial
construction of the first prototype is
under way. This puts the European
manufacturers a jump ahead of their
US rivals for a change; so much so that
at least three American airlines, as well
as BOAC and Air France, have already
stated their intention of equipping with
Concordes. This is a major breakthrough
in the highly competitive aviation in-
dustry which has been dominated since
the war by the US contractors.
One of the main reasons for this has
been the understandable preoccupation
of the American aviation industry, for
the last five years, in the space race
and defence contracts which together
amount to twenty billion dollars annually
in their own particular area of tech-
nology. It is hardly surprising therefore
with money flowing at this phenomenal
rate that they should be tardy in
diverting their attention to the relatively
risky commercial proposition of develop-
ing a supersonic airliner. Nevertheless
design studies are now being conducted
because the orders for the Concorde
spurred the US Government into action
with a grant of three-quarters of a
billion dollars towards the billion or two
it will cost to develop the aircraft; al-
ready orders are rolling in although
neither a manufacturer nor a design
has yet been decided upon.
Figures of this magnitude give one
pause to wonder if we are not losing
our sense of proportion of time and
distance; is it so imperative that we
should be able to get to Europe in
half a day, that someone is prepared
to spend the total value of Australia’s
annual exports to achieve it? Is this a
genuine requirement, a real necessity or
are we paying homage to supersonics,
and becoming dazzled by our tech-
nological achievements? Whichever it is,
the supersonic airliner is already taking
shape because its makers claim it to be
a commercial proposition—by this they
mean it will only cost you £5OO for
your half-day’s experience of racing the
sun, in seven-league boots.
Clearly Qantas, which carries passen-
gers over longer sectors than other air-
lines, stands to benefit the most by
going supersonic; indeed they would be
committing commercial suicide if they
allowed their competitors to steal a
march on them. Understandably this is
a difficult decision, complicated by their
pool agreement with BOAC and Air
India on the one hand and on the other
by the fact that whereas the Concorde
will have a design speed of M:2 (twice
the speed of sound) the American air-
liner is being designed for M:3 but is a
year or so behind. As these aircraft are
likely to cost about £3 million and £5
million respectively the choice will re-
quire the utmost analysis and penetrating
clairvoyance; for if the right selection
is made, it could achieve a gross earning
capacity of over £l5 million per year.
This is an exceedingly onerous decision
for Qantas, and indeed for many other
international airlines, but they will be
forced to make it or else become un-
competitive.
Curely it is time for the world's inter-
national airlines to have an “agoni-
sing reappraisal” of their responsibilities
to the community and to themselves.
So long as they persist in demanding
that each technical advance shall be
applied only to speed, then fares will
remain at their present high level, but
until they are permitted to be com-
petitive on fares they have no incentive
to do otherwise.
The International Air Transport
Association which sets the fares was
formed with the best of intentions, to
prevent a price war between airlines
jeopardising safety standards which was
laudable; unfortunately it has since de-
generated into a cartel which bolsters
fares to support the less efficient air-
lines (we can be proud that Qantas is
among the top of the list in efficiency
factors).
Many airlines have threatened to
leave lATA and many more have never
joined because of its cavalier attitude
but it is important to note there is now
no significant difference between the
safety record of members and non-
members.
Now is the time for lATA to re-
consider its policy as it affects the air
traveller, because as we enter the super-
sonic era, fewer and fewer airlines-will
be able to justify the cost of supersonic
equipment compared with the ad-
vantages it has to offer for anything but
the longest routes. This is only the
beginning. If we have airliners that will
travel at M:2 to M:3 by the 19705, we
might expect M:l2 by the year 2000 and
even orbital speed by 2025, but where
does it get us except somewhere fast?
Imagine Sydney to London in 45 minutes
but with an hour at each end to get into
town. However, one thing is certain—it

will not be any cheaper. As a result in-
ternation air travellers will remain as
they are today, a minute fraction of
one per cent of the community Aviation
has a greater responsibility to fulfil
than to cater merely for businessmen and
government officials on expense accounts
or the minuscule few who can actually
afford a long-distance ticket.
It is a fundamental law of nature
that speed requires an extravagant use
of energy. The faster we go the more
extravagant we become; the compensa-
tion in our materialistic society is that
we offset this extravagance against time-
costs-money and reach an equable
balance. This balance is now and in the
foreseeable future way beyond the means
of the majority who will soon be offered
speeds beyond their needs at fares that
are already beyond their pockets.
In the half century that the aircraft
industry has existed it has made fan-
tastic strides in the fields of metallurgy,
aerodynamics, power systems and the
like, not without many giving their lives
for the cause.
With this vast fund of expertise it
seems inconceivable that we should be
incapable of building an airliner of
moderate performance yet veritably
economic.
So far no one has tried because no one
has asked for it. Why should they, when
their fares are fixed regardless? The
major international airlines’ competitive
drive has had to be speed, whilst the
secondary international airlines have
gratefully accepted their big brother's
cast-off equipment of yesteryear; thus
has the pattern been set. Of course not
all the blame lies with lATA; the manu-
facturers themselves have compounded
it by beating the drum over speed and
yet more speed as their main sales plug.
This is understandable because nearly
all their research and development funds
are provided to cover military aircraft
whose only civil by-product is speed.
So over the years aviation has got itself
caught up in a vicious circle of its own
making with but a single motivation —
the faster the better.
The solution lies with the airlines to
reorientate their thinking along two
separate paths: the supersonic airliner
will naturally operate under the present
economic structure but they must also
establish the right to operate moderate
performance aircraft at a quarter or
less of supersonic fares. Once this has
been established then the industry can
concentrate their enterprise on producing
unspectacular aircraft with the emphasis
on economics instead of speed.
A radical reduction in fares would
then be practicable which would
revolutionise the whole airline structure
and inject new life into this great in-
dustry at present balanced on an
economic knife-edge.


Around Melbourne
VALE, OSIRIS AND THE MIGHTY WURLITZER!
T7or seven years now we have
watched our movie houses being
turned into offices, storage sheds,
bowling alleys, even into artificial ski
runs and, frankly, nobody has cared
very much. But now we have bitter
news. On February 5 the Capitol in
Swanston Street, right opposite the
Town Hall, will be shooting its last
reel.
To be honest, I hadn’t thought
much about the Capitol for years.
All I remembered was that it had
marvellous, deep, leather chairs in the
lounge, better than the chairs in the
Melbourne Club, and it had this
superb ceiling which delicately and
beautifully kept changing color. The
ceiling was always better than the
movie.
Well, right after the announcement
a “Save the Capitol” campaign went
into action. There was a letter of pro-
test from this distinguished archi-
tectural team: Professor Brian Lewis,
Robert Eggleston and Geoffrey Wood-
ward. They pointed out that the
Capitol had been designed by Walter
Burley Griffen. It was a world-
famous building; indeed, one of the
most important theatres ever built . . .
Eric Westbrook, director of the
National Gallery, came in, too.
Apparently the gorgeous ceiling, with
its fantastic pattern of prisms and
cubes lit by 4500 colored lights, was
designed by Marion Mahony (Mrs
Walter Burley Griffin). Mr West-
brook would like to see the ceiling
placed in one of the theatres of his
new Cultural Centre.
But let’s go back. The Capitol
opened on November 8, 1924, and it
cost more than £500,000. Until then
picture theatres were little more than
halls, but here was the start of a new
era. The Capitol was the first dinkum
de-luxe movie palace in the Southern
Hemisphere.
It opened with Cecil B. de Mille’s
“The Ten Commandments”, which
was advertised as “The World’s
Mightiest Spectacle—As Powerful in
Appeal as the League of Nations.”
. . . “SEE—the Belching Forth from
the Heavens of One Commandment
After Another SEE the Bacchana-
lian Orgy in Adoration of the Golden
Calf SEE the Strong Power of
Mother Love”.
Before the start of the film there
was a stage performance known as an
“atmospheric prelude”, which in-
cluded not only the biggest sphinx
ever built in Australia, but the Egyp-
tian God Osiris, the throne room of
the Pharaohs and the death of
Rameses.
For the world's mightiest spectacle
the “Herald” brought out a mighty
12-page broadsheet supplement. The
“Herald” pointed out that the mag-
nificent Wurlitzer organ cost £15,000
and that there were only four of its
kind in the world. There was no
musical instrument in existence whose
sound could not be reproduced on
this organ.
The lifts in the “towering building”
were the most up-to-date yet seen in
Melbourne. They were capable of
the high speed of 300 feet a minute,
and among the first passengers was
Dame Nellie Melba. “The lift was
delayed on its return journey to the
upper floors while the diva shook
hands with the liftman, and thanked
him for his regrets at her recent re-
tirement from opera.”
HThe dress circle foyer was “the
most richly furnished, the most
dignified, and the most costly room
outside of Paris, London or New
York ... a magnificent grouping of
old Italian Renaissance furniture
carved in dull walnut and covered
with a French damask of copper
tones. The ladies’ Louis XVI French
boudoir was “perhaps the gem of the
whole theatre. The furniture was
entrancing, being entirely laid with
22-carat leaf, and most richly carved
as the period denotes”.
As for the men’s smoke rooms:
“They are almost sombre, with that
quiet dignity which the modern man
so much appreciates for the use of
his more intimate friends. The chairs
are in a specially tanned hide of a
color something between a brown and
a verdigris green, finished and studded
with antique steel nails . . . the
difference between the ladies’ boudoir
and the smoke rooms is most marked.”
One could go on. There were
“scenes of bewildering beauty” . . .
One Hoyts man, Colin Mirams,
still remembers it all. The original
idea of the “atmospheric prelude”
continued right through the ’twenties.
For example, for silent “Beau Geste”
they built a superb desert fort on the
stage. They staged, too, the 1812
Overture with the fall of Moscow,
puffs of smoke, the lot.
The noise of the firing of the
cannon was done off-stage in good
style. They used blank cartridges in
a double - barrelled shotgun fired
against a suspended sheet of gal-
vanised iron. Jan Rubini, the con-
ductor, composer, violinist, was im-
ported from Los Angeles at vast
expense to conduct the 20 - piece
orchestra and the Postal Institute
choir.
And so the Capitol was a big
success. In the first days the crowds
were so big they pushed in the ticket-
sellers’ office. Mr Mirams arrived as
accountant after the first fortnight.
In that time nobody had been to the
bank. They showed him a rolled-top
desk that was brimming with cash and
bank notes between £7OOO and
£BOOO. The money had been pouring
in. Outside there was a regular staff
of police to control the crowds.
And that’s the trouble, you see;
with 2100 seats, the old Capitol is too
vast. People don't fight to get to the
movies any more, to relish their Ten
Commandments. The suggestion is
that the Capitol will be converted
into a large, modern, shopping arcade.
The problem is general. The State
Theatre, that noble eastern palace in
Flinders Street, has now spawned and
multiplied like a centipede. No
longer can the State operate profit-
ably as one vast entity. It has split
into two —the Forum and the Rapallo.
But you will be pleased to hear
that the Rapallo has retained some of
the atmosphere of the old State. The
figures of Atlas, Discobolus and
Augustus Caesar are still there for all
to see, resplendent in their fig leaves.

“AIR POWER OVER EUROPE”
Sir,
There were several inaccuracies and
misconceptions in "Ek Dum's” review
(11/1/64) of John Herington’s “Air
Power Over Europe, 1944-45.” “Ek
Dum” mentions that it was the 18th
volume of the Australian war history to
be published. It was the 17th. It was pub-
lished in July, 1963, and 4500 copies
have since been bought. He remarks
that “the seven Army volumes have now
been published.” One volume in this
series came out last month, but the
seventh, “Tobruk and El Alamein,” has
not yet been published; it should appear
this year.
“Ek Dum” then remarked that “the
British” would cover "the whole scope
of their war with 31 or 32 volumes
edited by Professor J. R. M. Butler of
Cambridge University, written by ex-
perts.” In fact, in addition to Sir James
Butler’s Military Series in the United
Kingdom “History of the Second World
War” (32 volumes), there are the Civil
Series, edited by Sir Keith Hancock (27
volumes), the Medical Series (21 vol-
umes), and the lonely “British Foreign
Policy in the Second World War,” by
Sir Llewellyn Woodward. Total, 81 vol-
umes, as against 22 in the Australian
war history.
“The American effort will be even
bigger and better than the British,” “Ek
Dum” then says, “something over 70
volumes at least.” The American Army
history alone looks like running to more
than 60 volumes; their Naval history is
in 14 volumes; their Army Air Force
history is in six, Marine Corps history
in five. Twenty volumes of the US Army
medical history have appeared.
“Ek Dum” next applies his arithmetic
to the number of words in John Hering-
ton’s paragraphs. Herington, he observes,
“plods patiently on for 500 pages in
paragraphs up to 400 words long,” and
“closes the book in a paragraph to end
all paragraphs, nearly 400 words long.”
I opened at random Macaulay’s “His-
tory of England” and the first two para-
graphs I counted contained 450 and
460 words; Gibbon’s “Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire” 570 and 900;
C. E. W. Bean who, “Ek Dum” exclaims,
“did not present his materia! in huge,
dreary slabs of paragraphs,” 362 and
330 (Vol. VI); Woodward, “The Age of
Reform,” 320 and 180; John Herington,
“Air Power Over Europe,” 260 and 190.
I regret to add, sir, that the opening
paragraph of Peter Hastings’ review of
“The Best of Lennie Lower” (11/1/64)
contains 213 words.
To be more serious: I cannot ask you
to give space to the reprinting of tlie
final paragraph of Herington’s book
the paragraph “into which,” “Ek Dum”
writes, “the reader’s mind sinks as into
a glue-pot;” but it would be surprising
if many people could read it without
emotion.

COMMUNISM IN INDONESIA
Sir,
With reference to Mr de Gidro’s letter
(11/1/64), may I answer his query about
my sources on Indonesia? They are:
(1) An excellent article by the English
Left-winger Paul Johnson in the “New
Statesman” of May 25, 1962, entitled
“Asia’s Next Decade.” It is an angry
exposure of Indonesia’s economic dis-
organisation and the corruption of its
ruling class. It reveals malnutrition
throughout the countryside, due to mis-
management, incompetence and xeno-
phobia (e.g., the disastrous pogroms
against the Chinese), reckless spending
of meagre resources on armaments to
underwrite an adventurist foreign policy,
and waste of 'funds on expensive pres-
tige projects.
(2) My factual material on the Indo-
nesian Communist Party is derived from
an article by Donald Hindley of the
ANU, entitled "The PKI and "the Peas-
ants,” in “Problems of Communism,”
Nov.-Dee., 1962. It says that according
to PKI figures the PKI increased its
peasant membership from less than
80.000 in 1954 to over one million in
1961. By 1959 the PKI had branches
in 84.2 per cent of all Javanese villages.
The growth of PKI-controlled mass-
organisations was spectacular. The Indo-
nesian Peasant Organisation leaped from
360,000 members in 1953 to 4.5 million
in 1962. The PKI youth organisation
went up from 70,319 members in 1953
to 1,250,000 in 1961. The Indonesian
women’s movement increased from
40.000 members in 1953 to 1,120,574 in
1961.
(3) Mr de Gidro seems to assume that
only feudal groups can be corrupt. This
is, literally, nonsense. As for his trust in
Moslem schoolteachers, I do not believe
that they are a substitute for good gov-
ernment, structural changes and eco-
nomic reforms.

ORD RIVER
Sir,
In Patricia Rolfe’s article on Mr
Charles Court (11/1/64), she concluded
by saying “ . . . but not even Court’s
worst enemies would want the farmers
to' walk off the Ord ...” I, for one,
would delight in seeing just this happen.
I say this not through being an enemy
of Mr Court but in protest to the con-
tinued attempts by politicians and others
to conceal any scientific findings which
they don’t approve of.
Dr Davidson, a noted scientist in the
field of economics, was employed by the
CSIRO to investigate the economics of
the Ord River Project. Although he ex-
pressed some personal opinions, his re-
sults showed conclusively that whatever
was produced on the Ord could be pro-
duced more economically on the estab-
lished irrigation areas in southern Aus-
tralia. He also showed that at present
it would be cheaper to pay all the people
on the Ord to sit down and do nothing
than to keep it going as at present by
heavy subsidies.
While Dr Davidson’s statement re-
garding defence may only be an opinion,
his findings regarding the economic situ-
ation are most certainly not. They are a
result of a thorough scientific investiga-
tion made while he was employed by the
CSIRO. The fact that the CSIRO chiefs
did not get the answer they had hoped
for caused them to try to hide the truth.
When Dr Davidson left them, in disgust,
he slowly revealed his feelings along with
the truth of the matter. This time he was
attacked by Mr Charles Court, who be-
came very indignant to think that his
hobby-horse was about to be looked in
the mouth. At this stage, however, it
did not matter so much. The public had
been informed, indirectly, that the Ord
was costing them a tidy little sum.
My protest is, then, why should the
public be kept from the truth in import-
ant matters such as this? Apparently it
is just to save the face of a handful
of people, in this case the CSIRO chiefs
and Mr Court. Why, at least, should we
not know just what these decentralisa-
tion and defence type schemes are cost-
ing us.

THE ORR SETTLEMENT
Sir,
Your account of the Orr settlement,
and Mr W. J. Ginnane’s contributed
article in “Forum” (28/12/63), raise a
number of questions, but I restrict my-
self here to the role that teachers of
philosophy have played, or are alleged
to have played, in these dealings.
Mr Ginnane speaks of a meeting in
Melbourne on December 10, which
formulated proposals for a settlement.
From Press accounts it appears that
(with the addition of a “confidential”
provision about Orr not applying for
any position in the University of Tas-
mania) these were the “terms of settle-
ment” later adopted by the University
Council. Orr was not present at this
meeting, and there has been some dis-
pute about whether it was reasonable to
assume that the proposals would be
acceptable to him as a final settlement.
But whether or not the proposals were
acceptable to Orr, or to Orr’s representa-
tive, Mr Ginnane says that the Tas-
manians also took them to be acceptable

to the philosophers, who would accord-
ingly lift their “ban” on the Hobart
chair. Now if this is so, it does seem
to have been an extraordinary —if un-
remarkably prescient impression for
the Tasmanians to have had. For the
philosophers (i.e., the council members
of the Australasian Association of
Philosophy), with the exception, so far as
I know, of only Professor Stout and Mr
Ginnane himself, had never seen or
considered the proposed terms, and have
not yet voted on the later Executive
motion to remove the “black ban”.
True, the philosophers had approved
tentative conditions for the lifting of the
ban, at their annual council meeting in
1962. (You say that this was in October,
and that it was approved by “about 50
full-time teachers of philosophy”, but
the philosophers’ own journal gives the
voting as 27 to 2, and the date as
August, 1962.) The conditions agreed to
by the philosophers, however, were not
the same as those of the December 10
Melbourne meeting; and, by suggesting
the nominal reinstatement of Orr, these
earlier proposals went some way towards
demanding from the university council
that “further token” for which Mr Gin-
nane is still hoping.
The fact that the university council
would undertake even “to join with other
Australian universities in accepting
conditions of tenure and procedures for
the investigation of serious charges of
misconduct” only as the result of
extreme academic pressure, suggests that
Mr Ginnane will be disappointed, and
makes one wonder why those who sought
a more satisfactory settlement spiked
their guns when Orr (who, unlike them,
stood to lose financially) was apparently
prepared to fight on.

PREFERENTIAL VOTING
Sir,
S. L. Seiler (21/12/63) thinks that
“preferential voting” is “a hit and miss”
affair as the result of his difficulty in
stating his preferences on a ballot paper
for the Senate election in Queensland.
Actually he was using a preferential
system known as proportional represen-
tation. It is, however, claimed that all
preferential or transferable vote systems
are fairer than the one vote-one value
system known as “first past the post,”
because the latter system can elect a
government commanding less than fifty
per cent of the total votes cast.
But the figures for the 1961 and 1963
elections for the House of Representa-
tives clearly show the return of a minor-
ity vote government in each case.
The really dangerous factor is the
“donkey vote” of from two to three per
cent, as it can decide the fate of a gov-
ernment. It is not possible with “first
past the post” voting, but is produced by
an unholy alliance between compulsory
voting and a preferential system requir-
ing “a number in each square.”

“MILITARY MIGHT”
Sir,
I read with ironic amusement the
statement by Frank Knopfelmacher
(28/12/63) advocating utmost military
vigilance towards Indonesia, combined
with firm resistance to any further terri-
torial demands: I would be far more
interested to learn from your corres-
pondent just what military might we
have to back a “firm resistance.” In 1916
in France our artillery was used spar-
ingly because every time it opened fire
the Germans retaliated with 10 shells
for every one our guns fired. A quarter
of a century later in Tobruk, whenever
our trench mortars opened fire 10 bombs
came from the enemy for each bomb
we fired.
It is a safe bet that if war broke out
tomorrow, our grandsons would pay the
same bitter price for unpreparedness, as
did their fathers and grandfathers.

CIVIL LIBERTIES
Sir,
There has been much talk recently of
the infringement of civil liberties when
a man is dismissed from a position for
moral misdemeanors. There has also
been talk in the Press, and on TV, of
book censorship being an infringement
of these same civil liberties. In both
cases the moral protection of the public
has been completely overlooked.
It is not a curtailment of our civil
liberties to have dangerous drugs on a
prescription list, or to have a compulsory
“stop” sign at a dangerous level crossing.
Human nature being what it is, we need
the protection of these laws for our
health, and for our safety. We need
protection for the young in schools and
universities from men who will exploit
their youth and inexperience.
Those who think it is “adult” to read
pornography, or see it on the screen,
are those who have not matured enough
to see that it leads to a way of life
that ends in mental and physical break-
down in the individual and decay in
society. As for who decides what is
pornographic, why quarrel with that any
more than who decides what is a
dangerous corner that needs a stop sign?
We elect the men who are put in charge
of dealing with such matters.

“THE NATION”
Sir,
As an American living in Australia,
I wonder how many of your readers
realise that “The Nation”, from which
you reprinted (21/12/63) an article on
the political effects of the Kennedy
assassination, represents, in American
politics, but a more sophisticated version
of that Leftism which, in the case of
the ALP, you criticised elsewhere in that
same issue!
I am sure that millions of patriotic,
law-abiding Americans deeply resent a
tendency in the Press to blame the
assassination somehow on a “climate of
opinion - ’ supposedly engendered by those
who love and respect the Constitution,
rather than on the Communist conspiracy
■ —probably the Castro branch—to which
the assassination is linked by means of
irrefutable evidence.

REVIEWS
THEATRE
The Devil in a Beatle Wig
And Job in a grey flannel suit
By KEVON KEMP
J.B. Archibald MacLeish. Independ-
ent Theatre. Sydney.
TTobin Lovejoy, that excellent man of
the theatre, has made an exciting
return to Sydney’s stage with a piece
“J. 8.” that could easily have
downed a lesser man. I don’t know if
you will long remember the play, which
is pretty much of a philosophical mud-
dle, but you will find yourself admiring
the bravura and blazing excellence of Mr
Lovejoy’s production.
American poet Archibald MacLeish
has taken the long argument on the
nature of God, which is the Book of
Job, and set it in modern surroundings.
The man of power and wealth and up-
rightness, Job, of whom God was vul-
nerably proud, becomes a superman in a
grey flannel suit, a US executive known
as J.B. J.B. does all he should, is a
good man, honors God but is struck
down just the same. He loses his child-
ren (fewer in the play than the Bible’s
seven sons and three daughters); his
wealth, his home, his wife. He is plagued
by burns and infections (and apparently
denied antibiotics); he lies shattered
after a bombing raid has wiped out his
last child. Despite all, and in spite of the
Devil’s confidence that “Job” will curse
God, J.B. stays true.
His only puzzle is that Promethean
one of “Why?” He demands that God
shall show him his guilt; the sinless J.B.
wants his fault to be made known; he is,
in the end, pretty much like Prometheus
he rates himself on a level with God,
wants to see God, does see God.
I’m not sure what God’s final position
is, although I have always suspected
that the end of the Book of Job means
that Job won out, and that the Almighty
bowed Himself out of the picture with
His words . . . “then I confess unto thee
that thine own right hand can save thee.”
I don’t think you will be any surer
than I am about what Mr MacLeish has
achieved in his play. He has changed the
traditional Job’s comforters into three
protagonists of varying views roughly
equated to Church, Communism and
Science who put a series of overly
simple propositions to J.B. But there is
no subtlety in MacLeish, and the best
parts of his play come when his God
figure (Mr Zuss, an out-of-work actor)
and his Satan figure (Mr Nickles, an
active popcorn seller) are acting out the
broad lines of the Biblical legend. Many
of the best lines, too, spring straight from
the King James translation.
What you will get from the production
is great vitality in the acting, a superb
design (by Quentin Hole) that makes the
firmament lovably tatty, and a setting
that allows a clean artistry of significant
movement and grouping to flow in a
master’s style. There is quite some glory,
too, in the acting of Alexander Archdale
as Mr Zuss, John Unicomb as Nickles
(in an inspired Beatle-type coiffure that
gives the Devil an extraordinary im-
mediacy) and of Leonard Teale as J.B.
But, then, the ensemble all through is re-
markably adept, and the final scenes in
which a group of street shelterers help
and warm the injured J.B. achieve a
human integrity that is Mr Lovejoy’s
own.
House Party
Hay Fever. Noel Coward. St Martin’s
Theatre. Melbourne.
“ITay Fever” is a witty comedy about
a weekend house party in the
country. Each of the members of the
Bliss family—mother, father, son and
daughter—has invited a weekend guest.
The visitors do not object to flirtation,
but in the unconventional Bliss house-
hold they get more than they bargained
for. Judith Bliss, ex-actress, former star
of melodramas with titles like “Love’s
Whirlwind”, believes in treating all the
world as a stage. Her husband and
children also have a flair for histrionics.
Before Saturday evening is over, the out-
raged guests find themselves cast in roles
taken straight from “Love’s Whirlwind”.
On Sunday morning, after spending a
hellish night in uncomfortable rooms, all
four guests rebel and, while the family
argue at the breakfast table, all shouting
at once, they silently decamp.
Looking back now one can see that,
although he seemed almost to be writing
social satire in “Hay Fever”, in fact
Coward did no more than make gentle
fun of a society which he accepted
wholeheartedly. With the passing of that
society his work lost its early vitality.
Under the skilful direction of Irene
Mitchell a clever cast gives a lively per-
formance. June Clyne, trailing wisps of
georgette as she floats majestically about
the stage, is delightful as the histrionic
Judith.
MADELEINE ARMATRONG
ART
Aboriginals
Aboriginal Art. Chatterton’s Gallery.
Sydney.
the second exhibition within a
few months organised by the Bennett-
Campbell Aboriginal Trust in Sydney,
has some of the finest work seen here.
It is particularly strong in a group of
largish carved figures from Bathurst and
Melville Islands, whose stylistic character
can be traced to fairly recent Indonesian
influence. The X-ray bark paintings are
varied and splendid in their concept of
animal form, but from all over Arnhem
Land a bewilderingly rich array of
religious, lay and secular art and craft
commands attention. If. as many predict,
the production of native art for sale to
the white man necessitates a lowering
of standards, they should examine this
show to see that this need not happen,
provided a careful encouragement of
serious work is made.
Crucial to the continuance of aborigi-
nal culture are two things: the per-
petuation of initiation rites with the
handing on of a kina of training in all
the artistic skills, and recognition by the
white man, not only trained anthropo-
logists, welfare officers or missionaries,
of the unique value of this culture.
Exhibitions like this one, or the pre-
sentation of aboriginal dance and music,
provide cultural achievements in no way
inferior to our own. In a real sense
these achievements would be acceptable
anywhere in the world. For encourage-
ment to work, it requires active support
(the Millingimbi recently received two
new fishing boats from sales of art in
the South) and it is therefore under-
standable that the Trust will seek over-
seas support, in Singapore, Hong Kong,
Japan, Europe and eventually the USA.

A Man for All Seasons. Channel 2.
Sydney.
VIfiLLiAM Sterling is perhaps the most
- distinctive and stylistic producer in
Australian television. In each of his
shows he rarely misses an opportunity
for adventurous experiment with lighting
or camera-angles. His superb production
of Robert Bolt’s “A Man for All Sea-
sons” succeeded where some of his prev-
ious productions have failed, because all
his gimmicks worked, and worked mag-
nificently, so that the effect was exciting
where it may have been (and has been)
merely tricksy and pretentious. The play,
embodying some of More’s actual
statements, examines the conflict of
loyalties in Sir Thomas More when
Henry VIII broke with Rome and claimed
leadership of the English Church. The
extremely intelligent and pointed writing
is engrossing on several levels. His multi-
dimensional human types are explored
in an authentic historical context, and
the conceptual issues are subtly played
out. The character of More himself,
echoing Eliot’s Becket, is brilliantly
realised, a complex mixture of the intel-
lectual and the innocent, at once confi-
dent and insecure. “A Man for All Sea-
sons” combines the homely with the
emblematic, the tragic with the graceful.
Sterling’s treatment of it varied, but
was always tightly controlled, and his
emphases were firmly placed. His camera
movement was sometimes nervous and
tense, sometimes flowing, while at all
times intensifying the action and sug-
gesting the subtext. The angular sets and
dramatic lighting never attracted atten-
tion outside their part in the total effect,
but nevertheless displayed imagination
and daring. After a succession of bril-
liant, but integrated, effects, the final
tableau of the execution was stunning.
The ascetic-looking Wynn Roberts
gave a beautifully measured performance
as More. The extent to which he re-
created his Becket in Sterling’s excellent
1962 production of “Murder in the
Cathedral” was only that to which Bolt
followed Eliot, or most likely, to which
More was like Becket. Only occasionally
did a sententious note disturb the sensi-
tivity and ultimate humanity of his char-
acterization. Kevin Mcßeath was suave
and authoritative as Cromwell, and Neil
Curnow gave a fine, understated
portrayal of the venal Rich. And John
Gray if anything improved on his very
good stage performance as The Common
Man, who serves to link the incidents
and provide low-life counterpoint to the
intrigue and battle of ideals.

Nightmares in Slumberland
America's merry morticians
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
The American Way of Death. Jessica
Mitford. Hutchinson. 31s.
Tn 1947 a Mr W. W. Chambers, self-
styled “slab-happy mortician” of
Washington DC, gave evidence before
a Congressional committee into Ameri-
can funerary practices. Morticians, said
Mr Chambers with disarming candor,
operated “the most highly-specialised
racket in the world.” Discussing the
national habit of subjecting cadavers to
costly embalming before burial, Mr
Chambers offered the opinion that any
good plumber could learn to embalm in
60 days. “I could embalm a human body
for 40 cents, and an elephant for a
dollar and a half,” he said. These dan-
gerous admissions shocked his fellow
morticians from coast to coast But the
effect on the public was not perceptible.
In 1961 the average cost of an Ameri-
can funeral, w'ith all the customary trim-
mings, was nearly £.500 and the total
national burial bill was about two bil-
lion dollars which was more than the
amount spent on police forces, fire bri-
gades or dental services. “Funerals,” an-
nounced the National Funeral Directors’
Association, “are becoming more and
more a part of the American Way of
Life.” Gracious Dying had become at
least as important as Gracious Living.
How has this staggering industry
grown up, and what do Americans get
in exchange for their multi-miliion dol-
lar outlay on burying or burning each
others’ remains? Jessica Mitford dissects
the whole business with authoritative
aplomb backed by a wealth of carefully-
documented detail. This is a richly en-
tertaining book. It is also a slightly hor-
rifying one. Sceptics who thought that
“The Loved One” (whose author was
once described by the US journal “Mor-
tuary Management” as Evelyn Bites-the-
Hand-that-Feeds-Him Waugh) soared
into the realms of fantasy will find that,
as usual, truth is more incredible and
infinitely more ludicrous that fiction.
Let us then follow the author as she
traces the fortunes of a Loved One (pre-
sumably some are Heartily Disliked
Ones, but the ritual is the same) after
he or she has expired. (Loved Ones, like
Old Soldiers, never die. Nor do they
simply fade away if the embalmer can
help it, as will be seen.) First comes the
Arrangement Conference. The mortician,
advises “Successful Mortuary Opera-
tion,” should take care to “speak slowly
and with real sincerity” if he is to attain
his object of talking the LO’s relatives
into ordering the costliest possible fune-
ral. Everything hinges on the purchase
of the casket (coffin), the cost of which
includes all the ancillary services such
as embalming, public display in the Slum-
ber Room of the mortuary chapel, the
Cadillac casket-coach (hearse), attend-
ants and, if required, a religious service.
The last-named is provided by wheeling
into the chapel the particular “devo-
tional set” appropriate to the religious
denomination of the LO. Caskets come
in all sorts of materials and all grades
of prices up to luxury models of about
1000 dollars. The Valley Forge Casket,
for example, is of finest hardwood and
“symbolises the solid, dependable Ameri-
can ideals so bravely tested at Valley
Forge.” For the less rugged oj the bon
viveur there is the Monaco all-metal
unit, its interior “richly lined ir. Cheney
velvet, magnificently quilted and shirred,
with matching jumbo bolster and cover-
let.” The simple homebody who w'ants
just plain comfort is catered for by the
Major Casket Company’s Beautyrama
Adjustable Soft-Foam Bed. A patented
non-slip elevating device ensures that
the Loved One may be raised for bet-
ter viewing without sliding down the
mattress.
casket having been selected, the
LO is removed to that part of the
mortician’s establishment dedicated to the
'art of the embalmer. No US law requires
embalming; doctors have ridiculed
claims that it ensures “eternal preserva-
tion” of the LO’s remains; clergy have
denounced it as extravagant and irre-
ligious. Yet somehow the idea has been
driven into the national mind that any-
thing less than embalming and public
displaying is indecent, miserly and un-
American. Most morticians embalm a
LO as a matter of routine without
bothering to inquire whether the relatives
w'ant it. By the time the common corpse
has been transformed into a Beautiful
Memory Picture, he, or she, has been
sprayed, sliced, pierced, pickled, trussed,
creamed, waxed and painted. Into the
LO’s arteries has been pumped one of
the numerous varieties of embalming
fluid perhaps Flextone, which “im-
parts a mild, flexible rigidity” to the
limbs. Lyf-Lyk Tint has restored “na-
ture’s own skin texture.” A Repose
Block supports his torso so that he
does not lie too deep in the casket.
(Mourners don’t like a Loved One to
appear to be lying in the bottom of
a box.) He is elegantly but not too
ostentatiously clad; hostess gowns or
“brunch coats” may be favored for fe-
male LOs. The feet, encased in Practi-
cal Burial Footwear, rest on a Throop
Foot Positioner. A favorite pipe may
be placed in a male LO’s hand, or a
book if he was of the intellectual type
and read books.
Did the LO die disfigured, jaundiced
or cadaverous? No matter. “This is the
time,” says a mortuary embalmers’ hand-
book stoutly, “for intestinal fortitude
and determination.” An Armstrong Face
Former is at hand to help restore se-
renity to the LO’s countenance. Cream
can be injected into the sagging flesh.
Even Lip Drift (that perennial problem)
may be controlled by “pushing one or
two pins through the inner margin of
the lower lip and inserting them between
the upper front teeth.” After the apo-
theosis in the Slumber Room the actual
burial in a Memorial Park (cemetery)
is something of an anti-climax. Science
is with us, however, even to the grave’s
edge. The ritual scattering of earth over
the casket may be accomplished “with a
mere flick of the wrist by a Gordon
Leak-Proof Earth Dispenser. No grasp-
ing a handful of dirt, no soiled fingers.
Simple, dignified, beautiful, reverent!
The modern way!”
One remarkable feature of the Ameri-
can necropolitical scene is the fierce
competition between morticians and pri-
vately-owned cemeteries. Most Memorial
Parks, like the mammoth Forest Lawn
of Los Angeles with its encasketed or
inurned population of 200.000 and its
intake of 6000 a year, have their own
mortuary chapels and conduct their own
funerals. They have also built up an
enormously lucrative business in “pre-
need” sales. Grave-space salesmanship
has become a specialised profession.
“Late model automobile, neatness, sin-
cerity and truth a must,” said one ad-
vertisement for salesmen, doubtless list-
ing the qualifications in their proper
order of importance. One might naively
imagine that this competition would tend
to reduce funeral costs. Far from it.
Against the eccentrics who want to be
quietly tucked away for a mere few hun-
dred dollars the mortician and the
Dreamer of Forest Law'n stand shoulder
to shoulder to preserve the Funeral As
Status Symbol.
Understandably there are now many
signs of revolt against this funerary sat-
urnalia. Nearly 100 local co-operative
funeral societies have been formed to
provide their members with simple, low-
cost burials. “The movement,” said the
“National Funeral Service Journal”


sourly, “appeals most strongly to the
visionary, ivory-tower eggheads.” Other
trade spokesmen have been less deli-
cate. “The promulgations of these outfits
hint at Communism and its brother-in-
law, Atheism,” declared one. Others
likened the co-operatives to “burial beat-
niks” and “so many weasels sucking
away at the lifeblood of our basic
economy.”
The churches, too, are up in arms.
“Ministers seem to be getting into the
act more and more,” lamented one writer
in “Mortuary Management.” “Nosy
clergymen” who influence parishioners in
the direction of cheaper funerals are
the burden of the frequent complaint at
morticians’ conventions. But the sky is
not all dark. There are signs that the
American mortality rate, which fell by
50 per cent between 1880 and 1960,
may decline no further. Funeral directors
even point hopefully to a slight trend
in the opposite direction. As Mr W. M.
Krieger, managing director of the Nat-
ional Selected Morticians’ Association,
remarked: “We cannot continue to ex-
pand the span of life indefinitely.” Medi-
cal science is doing its best, but death
must go on.

The Prophet Outcast: Trotsky, 1929-
1940. Isaac Deutscher. Oxford
University Press. 68s.
“Yesterday,” George Bernard Shaw
-*■ wrote to the young American actress
Molly Tompkins, “I had with me a
bundle of reports of the speeches of
our great party leaders, and a half-crown
book by Trotsky . . . For sheer, coarse,
savage bloodymindedness it would be
hard to beat the orations of Birkenhead,
Lloyd George, and Churchill. For good
sense, unaffected frankness, and educated
mental capacity give me Trotsky all the
time. To turn from the presidential
campaign in your country and the
general election here to his surveys of the
position is to move to another planet.”
Nowhere were Trotsky’s “educated
mental capacity” and his outstanding
moral integrity more evident than in his
clear-sighted, principled and unrelenting
struggle against Fascism and Stalinism.
No one was a purer “classical Marxist”
than Trotsky; no one was more anxious
to reduce Nazism to class interests and
positions in capitalist society, or to insist
that the Stalinist bureaucracy could only
be a temporary aberration in a society
in which private property had been
abolished. “But History,” he wrote, “has
to be taken as she is, and when she
allows herself such extraordinary and
filthy outrages, one must fight her back
with one’s fists.” In the 1930 s he was
one of the few who fought, and who
could recognise a filthy outrage when he
saw one.
Trotsky, one of the founding fathers
of the Communist International, watched
with fear, shame and anger the capitula-
tion of the Communist International, its
blindness to the difference between
Chancellor Bruning and a possible
Chancellor Hitler, its refusal to co-
operate with the Social Democrats, its
asinine belief that a short period of Nazi
dictatorship was to be welcomed as the
prelude to the final collapse of Capita-
lism. “If you identify Bruning with Hit-
ler,” Trotsky wrote before Hitler took
office, “you identify the situation before
the battle with conditions after defeat.”
If Hitler came to power, the workers’
organisations would be totally destroyed
and Mussolini and Napoleon 111 would
be made to seem “mild, almost humani-
tarian, small-town apothecaries”. For one
thing Trotsky never failed to understand:
Nazism was not counter-revolution from
above, not just the hidden conspiracy of
big business struggling against Com-
munism; Nazism was savagery, it was
the counter-revolution from below, it
was the petty bourgeois run amok
Vis-a-vis the Great Trials and Purges
organised by Stalin, Trotsky was no
doubt in a privileged position. No one
is surer of the lie than he who is
slandered. But while Gorky and Ehren-
burg and Sholokhov and Romain Rolland
and Barbusse and Aragon and Leon
Feuchtwanger and Theodore Drieser
were calling for death to the Trotskyist
traitors, while Louis Fischer and Walter
Duranty vouched for Stalin’s integrity,
Vyshinsky’s veracity and the humane
methods of the GPU, while Beatrice and
Sidney Webb announced that physical
torture was not used in the “new civil-
isation” of Stalinist Communism, Trot-
sky’s scathing exposures and indictments
fell on extraordinarily deaf ears. If
Judas had succeeded, Trotsky thundered,
he would have portrayed the 11 chief
apostles and the 70 lesser apostles as
traitors: this is precisely what Cain-Stalin
has done.
Even Bernard Shaw, convinced of
Trotsky’s innocence of Stalin’s charges,
was alienated by such retorts. “The
strength of Trotsky’s case was the in-
credibility of the accusations against
him,” Shaw wrote. “But Trotsky spoils
it all by making exactly the same sort of
attacks on Stalin. Now I have spent
nearly three hours in Stalin’s presence
and observed him with keen curiosity,
and I find it just as hard to believe that
he is a vulgar gangster as that Trotsky
is an assassin.”
Just three years later, soon after an
unsuccessful Communist shooting ex-
pedition against his bedroom, Trotsky
was to lie on the floor of his study in
Mexico, with assassin-Stalin’s ice-pick in
his brain.
For those of us to whom Trotsky
represents the last great personality of
classical Marxism as a movement worthy
of human admiration and respect, the
three volumes of Deutscher’s biography,
with all their imperfections, are pre-
scribed reading that we would have
everybody read: a saga of the human
spirit in our times, perhaps nowhere as
great and as moving as in this final
volume that takes Trotsky through his
years of exile, through his continuing
battle with the hypocrisy of “democratic”
statesmen and the cunning of Stalinist
assassins, through the personal tragedies
of his daughter’s suicide, his emigre son’s
death in Paris, his family’s sufferings
under Stalin.
For those of us who want not only to
share but also to understand, who want
to know if the saga had meaning, if
Trotsky was right or wrong in his
struggle, morally and politically, Isaac
Deutscher is a flat and pedestrian guide.
The greatness of his biography lies not
in the man who wrote it but only in
him whose story it is.

Sir John Jeffcott. R. M. Hague. Mel-
bourne University Press. 355.
TI/Ir R. M. Hague’s short work is a
■*■*•*• portrait of Sir John Jeffcott, the first
judge to be appointed to the Supreme
Court of South Australia. He fits very
well into the gallery of early Australian
judges, particularly matching in history
and manners the Bents in New South
Wales. Both he and J. H. Bent had an
Irish background; both set store by their
positions, though Jeffcott was knighted
prior to his appointment and Jeffrey
Hart Bent was wildly indignant that he
wasn’t. Both were in trouble wherever
they went and both caused their sponsors,
at intervals, worry about where next to
send them. Jeffcott adorned such varied
places' as Adelaide and Sierra Leone and
Bent proved that he could be as quarrel-
some in British Guiana as in New South
Wales.
Jeffcott, however, rather had the edge
on Bent’s record. He was one of the few
judges who ever killed a man in a duel
and enjoyed the view from the dock in-
stead of his customary one over it. He
once helped to capture a slave ship
and in the end was drowned out of a
whaleboat among the breakers at the
mouth of the River Murray. Bent, on the
other hand, only threatened toll-keepers
and Governors and nobody succeeded in
drowning him. The book is no more
than a good and sometimes amusing
thumbnail sketch.

Expiation
Cat and Mouse. Gunter Grass. Seeker
and Warburg. 225. 6d.
C erman literature has always been
short on realism, humor, and good
novels. In recent years there has been
an observable renaissance, growing out
of a new attitude to reality and to
language and seen in the work of
writers like Gunter Grass, Use Aichinger,
Heinrich 8011, Uwe Johnson, Siegfried
Lenz and Hans Magnus Enzensberger,
which promises to make up this
deficiency.
Midwife to this renaissance is the
“Gruppe 47”, with which all these
writers are connected. Gruppe 47 was
“formed” sixteen years ago. It has
no president, programme, funds or
members; two or three times a year it
comes into existence at meetings where
some of those present read their latest
work and face long and violent critical
sessions where the critics are in turn
criticised. The common denominator of
the group is not to be found in an
ideology or attitude, but in a view of
literature which sees aesthetic and
ethical criteria as inseparable and con-
centrates its attention on the point where
these two spheres meet and are realised,
i.e. in language. There is thus a new
concern with language as a literary-
social phenomenon with responsibilities
to art and to life.
The critique of language by writers like
Enzensberger is basically a critique
of society, the recognition that language
can be de-personalised and corrupted;
a refusal to let words take over, justify,
exalt, intoxicate; a belief in language as
an indicator and possible regulator of
the health of a society. Literary style
is seen not as controlled by purely
formal principles but as expressing
attitudes and judgments. Hence a new
distrust of words, a testing of every
formulation against a reality, concrete
or spiritual. There is, in a new sense,
a “poetic” approach to language, a
meticulous precision based on the
realisation that a given content formu-
lated in two different ways becomes
two different contents.
While this movement represents a new
direction in German literature it is not
without spiritual forbears. Its forerunner
is the expressionist Karl Kraus, whose
work has only received international
attention since the war, and whose fight
against the corruption of language was
based on the conviction that language is
a repository of human values. In “Die
Sprache” (1932) he shows how certain
attitudes are made acceptable by formu-
lations which, if challenged on the
linguistic level on which they first
emerge, would be revealed as false and
inhuman. “It is as if fate, for the
blessing of the language richest in
thought had punished (the Germans)
with the curse of living outside it; of
thinking after they have spoken, of
acting before they have questioned.”
Apart from the link with Kraus and
certain aspects of Expressionism, the
new literature has many resemblances
to, but few real affinities with, earlier
major writers of the 20th century.
Brecht’s “alienation technique”, Mann s
and Musil’s detached irony and fastidi-
ousness about words, Broch’s recognition
of art's ethical as well as aesthetic con-
science, all these point towards the new
movement, but form parts of very
different sum totals.
llThat distinguishes many of the best
contemporary German works is a
new realism; a balanced unsentimental,
blankly honest presentation of reality.
The fantastic improbability of events in
a work like Gunter Grass’s “The Tin
Drum” perhaps the most famous of
recent German novels has caused its
fundamental realism to be overlooked, a
realism measured in terms of perceptions
and reactions, not of the degree of
credibility of isolated events. (If this
were the criterion, Kafka would be a
realist). Instead of the search for absolute
truth, which has inspired so much of
German literature there is something
closer to home and perhaps more re-
warding, the search for absolute honesty.
This emerges very clearly in Grass’s
latest work, “Cat and Mouse”, excellently
translated by Ralph Mannheim. Set in
Danzig during the war it is the story
of Mahlke, a boy whose abnormally
large adam’s apple makes him the butt
of schoolboy jokes. One boy (the nar-
rator) induces a cat to leap at the adam’s
apple as if it were a mouse. When the
boys discover a half-submerged mine
sweeper Mahlke's prowess in under-
water swimming wins him acceptance.
He establishes a hide-out in the radio-
room which is above water but only to
be reached by hazardous underwater
manoeuvres which make it inaccessible
to the others. When an ex-pupil of the
school, now a hero wearing the Knight’s
Cross, addresses the school, Mahlke sees
the medal as the only adequate counter-
weight to his adam’s apple, steals it,
later confesses, and is expelled. On leave
from the army, himself decorated with
the Knight’s Cross, he returns hoping
to be asked to address the school, and
is smoothly rejected. Nothing can com-
pensate. Mahlke returns to the mine
sweeper with the help of the narrator
who, watching him prepare to dive to
his hide-out before rowing away, knows
obscurely that Mahlke will never surface
again.
As in “The Tin Drum” there are two
dominant symbols; the cat, the im-
placable aspect of reality to an isolated
individual (like the “black cook” in “The
Tin Drum”), and the radio-room, the
refuge to which, like the grandmother’s
skirts in “The Tin Drum,” no one else
has access. All Mahlke’s attempts to
placate the cat and protect the “mouse”
fail and he withdraws to his final refuge.
This work is slighter and slower than
“The Tin Drum,” and where Grass
solved brilliantly the problems inherent
in his earlier work, the problems of “Cat
and Mouse” are not overcome quite so
satisfactorily. For the story of Mahlke
which occupies almost the whole novella
does not contain the organising prin-
ciple of the work, its real theme.
The problem is to present essentially am-
biguous states and motives without reduc-
ing them to one or other of their poles.
In “Cat and Mouse” this is done with
such delicacy that it may easily be over-
looked altogether.
The only indication that this is not
simply the chronicle of Mahike lies in
a curious insistency of tone in certain
passages describing encounters between
Mahike and the narrator, which tends
to make us look for an allegorical key.
In fact there is no allegorical separation
of substance and significance What this
curious disproportion between tone and
action indicates is that we are approach-
ing the nodal points of the story, from
which the whole pattern must be focus-
ed. In spite, or because, of his elaborate
gestures of self suppression it is from the
narrator, not Mahlke, that we orient
ourselves. The story is, for him, an act
of expiation. Without having been acti-
vated by anything as clearly definable
as jealousy he has, at crucial points, pas-
sively failed Mahlke and, while appar-
ently having done more than could be
expected, is nevertheless abandoning him
when he rows away from the mine-
sweeper.
There is no statement of attitude to
Nazi Germany. Events are shown re-
flected in the experience of schoolboys
(of Grass’s own generation: he was born
in 1928) who, while suspicious of and
bored by mass-organisation and rhetoric,


are as innocently callous about war as
they are innocently obscene about sex.
But the central theme is guilt and re-
sponsibility; of a kind for which there
are no witnesses. Seen objectively
and the story is an objective account
the narrator is blameless, even com-
mendable, in his efforts on Mahlke’s
behalf. The original action of exposing
the “mouse” to the cat is not the real
problem. It is that of a far more intimate
betrayal, one which can all too quickly
be reasoned away, whose inhumanity jus-
tifies itself as “I’m-only-human.”

Luggage Labels
Cities. James Morris. Faber. 655.
exist shops in certain tourist
capitals possibly even in Sydney
where travel snobs can buy luggage
labels of most international hotels. For
about one pound outlay you can create
the illusion of having vacationed I
imagine that is the right word —at the
Nile Hilton, the Royal Hawaiian, the
Dorado (Puerto Rico), Round Hill (Mon-
tego Bay), the Ritz (anywhere) or the
Gritti Palace in Venice. It is like being
able to print your own money and may
even be as nice as the real thing. Mr
James Morris’ “Cities,” though it costs
twice as much, achieves the same effect.
Mr Morris has, in fact, been to the
places, but to anyone with no intention
of travelling, merely the desire to give
an impression of having travelled, he
could be indispensable. He gives 74
varieties against Heinz’s 57 all
pre-cooked. With a little gentle warming
a token flavor drifts to the surface. The
hatitue of these places will not be de-
ceived by rediffused Morris, but which
of us knows 74 habitues?
I have myself been to a mere 30 of
the 74 cities Mr Morris has touched
down at during his ten years’ wandering
as a foreign correspondent. Most of
these pieces appeared in “The Guardian,”
a few in “The Times” or “Saturday
Evening Post.” As such, they may have
passed an idle half-hour or so, though
they are useless to the intending traveller.
For their author, these articles exist as
souvenirs. The reader, however, has
reason to expect more tangible, less ob-
viously contrived, a motive for collecting
them together.
Mr Morris’ impulse in doing so is
understandable, but it is one he should
have resisted. For what can one say
remotely worth while about the great
cities of the world in three or four pages?
On the places I have been to I found
Mr Morris more readable than on those
I hadn’t; at least, there is the minor
pleasure of disagreement. He is short on
facts always, and on places one hopes
to see physical facts are better than
generalisations, no matter how chic the
latter. And it is generalisations, bol-
stered up by potted history, that Mr
Morris specialises in. They are the most
ephemeral coinage of all.
For Sydney he reserves his most ran-
corous two and a half pages. “The origins
of Sydney are unsavory, her history is
disagreeable to read, her temper is coarse,
her organisation seems to be slipshod,
her suburbs are hideous and her politics
often crooked, her buildings are mostly
plain, her voices rasp on the ear, her
trumpeted Art Movement is, I suspect,
half spurious” etc. etc.
In contrast, he sets up San Francisco.
It so happens that exactly a year ago
I moved from Sydney to San Francisco,
with high expectations. Now I find my-
self reversing nearly all Mr Morris’ com-
parative assessments. To my mind, any-
one, in 1964, who finds San Francisco to
have something on Sydney needs his head
examined. Before the fire and earth-
quake, maybe, but neither I nor Mr
Morris was alive then. If ever buildings
were plain San Francisco’s are; if ever
an art movement were “half-spurious” it
was that of the Beats, now dead or
departed.
That I disagree with Mr Morris is
hardly the point. He may, for all I
know, have suffered from a liver attack
in Sydney, or lost his wallet, or eaten a
bad oyster. There is, of course, some
truth in some of what he says. It is a
question of emphasis. If you presume
to deal with Sydney in less than three
pages, one would think there were bet-
ter ways of using the space. Mr Morris’
method is not merely shallow and mis-
leading, vulgar and pretentious; it raises
the whole matter of his competence and
reliability in far more important things.
He has mugged up a bit, wandered about
a bit. His conclusions, though, are based
on such flimsy evidence that his sporadic
skill in phrase-making, his occasionally
fine images, go for worse than nothing.
Thinking it over, a box of labels would
be a better present. Educationally, there
is nothing in it.

T ike James Morris’s “Cities” (reviewed
here by Alan Ross) Mr Fleming’s
book provides a conducted tour of world
capitals, but his sophistication, acuity
and use of highly disciplined prose make
him a far more reliable guide. His
response to Tokyo is particularly sharp-

charms of Hong Kong he does so most
agreeably. A recommended read.

son background at Cliveden, emerges
clear and rounded; the problems of his
class (and if none of them is financial,
the remainder constitute a multitude)
are presented fairly and with an under-
standing of his audience, without the
falsity of sentiment which so often mars
the dilettante product of patricians with
deep purses.
This in itself is a remarkable achieve-
ment for a man whose childhood sleep
was disturbed by the noise of the night-
watchmen punching time-clocks as they
went on their rounds through the family
home, whose first attempts with bat and
ball were guided by a cricketer hired
for the purpose from Lord's, whose
canoe on the Thames was electrically
powered.
Thoughout his whole life he has en-
countered the bearers of famous names.
His view of such people Churchill,
Cripps, Balfour, Shaw, Patton, Mont-
gomery and dozens of other luminaries
is personal, contributory to other
knowledge, and acute. Somehow he
emerges as neither a name-dropper nor
an apologist. He takes it for granted
that he, in his world, should rub
such shoulders constantly. He and his
two brothers, his father and his spec-
tacular mother all occupied seats in the
Commons or the Lords or both at one
time or another.
Any single volume must necessarily
be a severe condensation of such a life.
A major criticism could be that this
process is here carried too far, particu-
larly as to the more private aspects of
Astor’s life. One would like to know
more about this man, to appreciate more
of his nicely-shaded humor, and to
share more of his tolerant views. As
an author he is a stylist, with a nice turn
of phrase, and an occasional brilliant
simile.
“The Dinkumization and Depommi-
fication of an Artful English Immigrant”
strains after effect. If it implies that
Hesling became a typical Aussie (or was
born a typical Yorkshireman) it isn’t
even true. He, thank God, remained
individual to the point of non-classifi-
ability, devoted to what may perhaps be
defined as a Conservative - Liberal
anarchism, with an irreverent, amoral,
bawdy, circuitous and demonically
innocent approach to every problem,
large or small.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
New Struggles for Foodstuff Exports
Primary producers are not necessarily going to have an
easy time this year. While none of the experts appears
to predict that any main commodity prices will droop
significantly during 1964, raw material suppliers face a plague
of other problems.
Tariffs, quotas, price controls, access rights—all the devices
of vigorous protection raise their heads in several major
importing countries.
Australia has been drawn into a critical struggle straight-
away, for two of its principal exports, meat and cereals, are
immediately involved. Two of its most valuable customers,
USA and the United Kingdom, have started to crack the
protective whip.
Much of the jockeying is doubtless to be expected as the
Kennedy Round discussions approach. A great industrial
nation USA, fulsomely promises
a fair deal for commodities in
a tariff - reducing programme.
A panic attitude on the pre-
liminary sparring serves an ill
defence, yet plainly the bargain-
ing must be close and hard.
The old Common Market
familiar of temperate food-
stuffs, monotonously prominent
when Britain was applying for
entry, comes to the forefront
once more. The tactical battle
takes place in a world of con-
siderable overall agricultural
surplus.
Sir Alan Westerman and his
doughty team of Trade Depart-
ment negotiators have hurdled
the initial difficulties of their
meat talks in America with
more than moderate success.
They are now meeting the even trickier obstacles of proposed
British restrictions embracing a still wider range of rural
products.
Britain’s plan to place technical limitations upon all food-
stuff imports (outlined in last week’s Bulletin) provides yet
another example of an arrangement which can block free
commodity trading and also have a reasonable chance of
acceptance under the GATT umbrella.
Perhaps the best argument to be pressed by the commodity
exporters (especially the under-developed countries) is the case
for examining the whole international agricultural situation
on an exact par with industrial concerns at the GATT pre-
liminaries to the Kennedy Round. Until then normal rights of
entry, particularly Britain’s, should not be changed.
That position underlies the views adopted by Common-
wealth Trade Ministers last May in early reactions to the
possibilities of general tariff reductions under the US Trade
Expansion Act, from which the Kennedy Round itself stems.
They “were agreed on the importance of finding in these
negotiations solutions to the problems of temperate agricultural
products and of the exports of developing countries (including
processed and manufactured goods) no less than to the
problems of reducing tariffs on industrial products generally.
The ability of different Commonwealth countries to contribute
to these negotiations would vary with their circumstances. In
particular, the less developed countries would not be able to
afford reciprocal tariff concessions.”
It seems a tremendous pity to see Britain, with its traditional
policies of cheap food and free access, sliding back towards
quantitative restrictions and levies. However much self-
defence may be called for, the move towards world trade
expansion should not be prejudiced just now.
Despite extremely vigorous lobbying from its own meat
interests, that would appear to be the main reason behind
America’s decision not to re-
strict imports of Australian beef
and veal. The present situation
(with fair provision for future
growth) prevails until the whole
world meat trade gets resolved.
Sir Alan may have won only
a partial victory in America,
since there are still further
negotiations ahead. The stake
he is struggling for. both in
USA and Britain, is aonarent in
the attached granh
Britain's seise me wf.sch Aus-
tralia must find hard to swallow,
proposes to introduce minimum
prices for some imports (in-
cluding cereals) and quotas (on
meat) in an attempt to establish
a stable food market. Dis-
cussions with all overseas
suppliers are to be held, though
these must inevitably stub themselves against the obvious
hindrances imposed on free trade. Finally, of course, the
bargaining must descend to the size of the quota and the
height of the minimum price.
Of late years UK farm policy has encouraged farmers
heavily to lift output and has given them satisfactory prices
by way of subsidy, whatever the market price. Home and
imported supplies are now to come under control by levy and
quota, and a saving of subsidy.
It can easily be observed that Britain has one eye
firmly directed on the Common Market, which is also engaged
in plotting a united approach to the Kennedy Round. Between
high German agricultural costs and large French surpluses that
unity remains difficult to achieve.
The hoped-for package deal on agriculture went no further
than beef, rice and dairy products. Recent reports from
Brussels suggest that a common grain price may be patched
together, with implementation over two or three years.
The Six can still bog down the GATT talks by delaying


resolution of the special rules needed on tariff “disparities”
with the United States, where one side must be asked for a
more than proportionate percentage reduction.
Between such technicalities and the hard-to-lay protective
ghost, primary producers walk a ticklish path.
Soviet Problems Reassure
American Business
rowing evidence of the Soviet's economic problems is
expected to cushion any opposition in the USA to Presi-
dent Johnson’s sharp cuts in defence expenditure. Experts
now say that the US Administration can afford to cut back
some of its desperate expenditure on nuclear weapons because
the defence forces in America now have tremendous striking
power.
Reports from America indicate that stocks of fissionable
material had grown to surplus proportions a year ago, so it
was a logical development for the Administration to make a
25 p.c. slash in material for nuclear weapons.
Critics of America's crippling expenditure on defence have
been silenced by the promised cut in spending from 52 billion
dollars to 51 billion dollars in 1965 together with reductions
in appropriations for space projects. The more impressive
aspect of these cuts is that the cuts will extend to later years.
Service demands have been curbed on the basis that they
already have more weapons than they need. Some of the cuts
in appropriations for space programmes have been criticised
by scientists, however, on the grounds that too much political
and psychological emphasis is being placed in putting a good,
clean-cut American boy on the moon by 1970 or sooner,
depending on the competition offered by the Ruskies. But the
Administration claims you can't have tax cuts and still keep
spending ad infinitum, so President Johnson is hammering
home his policy of thrift, a very necessary platform to please
the financial conservatives.
To carry out the work started by the late President Kennedy,
he must achieve savings on defence and other government
projects to permit an increase in government expenditure on
education and health, and to cope with the stubborn pool of
5 p.c. unemployment (including retraining of unemployed
persons).
Legislation still is moving slowly and the Budget is not
expected to go through until late February. But promises of
tax cuts have kept the US economy moving and GNP is
expected to rise by 40 billion dollars to 625 billion dollars
this year. Those who have been watching for a crack in the
US boom are peering intently without success so far. because
news that the Russian economy is striking trouble has given
a new psychological push to business attitude in the US.
Step-Up in Building
Materials Production
fpHE latest Australian production statistics from Canberra
reveal that a boom was gathering in the building industry
well before November, when Sir Robert Menzies outlined his
plans for Federal aid to home-buyers which were to be insti-
gated if his party was returned to power. No doubt, Sir Robert’s
proposals are giving new acceleration to the boom cycle but
the makings of the process were there already.
The Commonwealth Statistician’s figures for the three months
to October 31 reveal a substantial overall increase in the pro-
duction of building materials over the results for the same
term in 1962. Clay and silica lime bricks turned out totalled
327.4 million compared with 291.7 million previously. Roofing
tile production moved from 29.7 million to 33.9 million and
over 920,000 tons of Portland cement and plaster of pans
were made against 826,000 tons in 1962.
Super feet of sawn Australian timber was 378 million, shad-
ing the previous 364 million. All types of sheeting and roofing
material gained well with the exception of cement sheets which
eased back from 7.9 million square yards to 7.8 million. Manu-
factured boards enjoyed the biggest jump in this section from
8.9 million square yards to 10.8 million.
It can also be seen that the boom commenced its build-up
quite early from a study of the production of building fittings
- production boosts here are often behind gains in the mat-
erials field but many fittings had already risen considerably
during the three-month period.
Production of gas fires and space heaters leapt from 1721
units to 5245 units and electric hot water storage systems from
21,816 to 27,616. Most other items gained only marginally or
lost ground except for stainless steel sinks which moved from
45,546 units to 51,745.
Wise Words Give Warning
to Timber Industry
fJpHE Australian timber industry as a whole is no doubt ex-
pecting to float to renewed prosperity on the certain swell
of the building boom. However satisfying that may be, the
industry should not forget at the same time to tackle its
manifest organisational problems and keep a close eye on the
likely supply situation during the next 10 or 12 years.
Some of these matters, especially the call for a measure of
rationalisation in the face of rival building materials, have been
repeatedly referred to by The Bulletin. They now receive
additional and extensive reinforcement from the Tariff Board’s
latest report, its fourth survey of sawmilling since 1955.
Despite the granting of higher duties on imports of Douglas
fir (from Canada and USA) and on Malaysian hardwoods,
investors don’t seem particularly willing just yet to discover
much rehabilitation in share prospects, although it is fair to
mention that most listed timber companies have moved above
1963 levels.
There’s still a wish to see the industry putting more of its
own house in order.
Even the Tariff Board suggested such a possibility by re-
marking that timber’s recent depression could not basically
be ascribed to imports competition.
And in rejecting the preservation of the previous temporary
quantitative restrictions the Board pertinently observed that
“regulation of timber imports, according to estimates of de-
mand, could destroy competition and reduce initiative in timber
promotion and merchandising. This is necessary in view of
increasing competition from substitute materials.”
Attention should also be paid to the belief that “forecasts
of demand for timber in 12 years’ time suggest that, despite
increasing production of non-indigenous timbers, Australia will
have to import a much higher proportion of its timber re-
quirements.” Imports now fill about 20 p.c. of total demand.
All the evidence, however, points to greater difficulty in
obtaining Douglas fir. As well, “Malaya’s timber exports could
fall to an insignificant figure by 1975 in view of the increasing
consumption of timber with the growth of population in
Malaya and an increasing per capita consumption in that
country. Malaya could become a net importer of timber.”


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
What Should We Export
and Where To?
(The third of a series of four articles on the Stanford Research Institute 9 s
survey, “The Development of Australia 99 )
On the future direction and makeup of
Australia's exports, the Stanford
Research Institute brings one back with
a jolt to the line of thinking more pre-
valent here when Britain looked like
going into the Common Market than it
is today when exports, particularly of
primary commodities and raw materials,
are hitting the roof.
“In the modern trading world”, its
survey states, “political and economic
factors play a large role. In many of the
staple primary exports the market is no
longer free. International commodity
agreements and national economic poli-
cies set quotas as well as prices, and
there is a clear tendency for such prac-
tices to extend, particularly in the agri-
cultural sphere.
“Wheat and sugar are obvious exam-
ples. Dairy products, which for decades
have been sustained in Australia by vari-
ous forms of subsidy, now encounter
market restrictions necessitated by simi-
lar subsidies abroad. The United States
and the European Economic Community
are closed, and the United Kingdom
faces an increasing milk surplus.
“It is this political pressure, exercised
always at the expense of the low-cost
producers, and reinforced by advancing
technology in the industrial countries,
that makes Australia’s reliance on pri-
mary exports so precarious. New fibres
compete with wool, plastics with leather,
synthetic oils with tallow, margarine with
butter and at the same time mechani-
sation, heavy fertilising, and such dis-
coveries as hybrid corn swell the agri-
cultural surpluses of the industrial
countries that might buy foods and agri-
cultural materials Australia produces.
These foods are too expensive for most
of the people in poor countries.”
T7ven so, the survey is not unoptimistic
about the prospects for primary ex-
ports, particularly wool and minerals. For
instance, it says that it seems unlikely
that the world demand for pastoral
products can be met by expanding pro-
duction in the highly industrialised
countries the United States, western
Europe and Japan.
Even with improved technology, the
relative advantage of those countries is
greater in manufacturing than in pastoral,
or even agricultural, production. For
political reasons dairying is subsidised
and protected. Australia, in fact, was
among the first countries to develop a
two-price system to protect its dairymen.
It seems unlikely that it can gain a much
larger share of the world market for
dairy produce.
Wool is still the stand-by. Its market
is world-wide and growing. Substitutes
have not been able to reproduce its
essential qualities. When its price goes
too high, mass-produced synthetics in-
vade its markets and are difficult to dis-
lodge. Both to keep prices from rising
unduly in a period of scarcity, so that
synthetics are encouraged, and to take
advantage of the growing demand, the
plea of the International Wool Secretariat
for increased production should be
heeded.
HThe growing market in Japan is evi-
dence that as industrial efficiency and
living standards rise, the world demand
for wool will increase. A reduction in
the United States’ tariff which is not
improbable, if not in the Kennedy Round
of tariff negotiations then within a few
years, would increase demand for wool
and woollen products. But for manu-
factured products particularly, it is
necessary to emphasise that quality and
distinction often count for more in the
American market than price. Australia
cannot afford to let up on its research,
design and marketing.
The survey also sees a reassuring
future for minerals and metal exports
and considers it reasonable to expect that
by 1975 Australian metal and mineral
annual exports could be £2OO million,
approximately three times the present
total. The exports could be greater than
this, depending on the scale of exports
of alumina.
This increased export market, plus
increased consumption in Australia,
would require 150,000 tons of zinc more
than Australia is producing at present.
Such expanded production would be
equivalent to an additional 165 p.c. of
the present annual copper production,
an additional 35 p.c. of present lead pro-
duction, and an additional 80 p.c. of
present zinc production
The survey states that of necessity,
however, Australia must look to manu-
factured exports to maintain equilibrium
in its balance of payments. And with
our high labor costs we must aim at pro-
ducing those which can utilise the cheap
coal and iron (and in future aluminium)
to fabricate semi-finished materials, and
also components, parts and finished
manufactures such as specialty steels re-
quiring a high degree of precision, design,
invention and innovation, coupled with
sophisticated market research and sales-
manship.
devices already patented and sold
abroad are primarily the by-products
of scientific research in such fields as ab-
sorption spectroscopy and a new method
of wool washing based on chemical re-
search. There are examples of success in
placing on the American and Japanese
markets fabricated parts to be used in
complicated machines, and at least one
has led to the whole apparatus being sup-
plied from Australia. But these are as
yet isolated examples of Australian
enterprise and invention.
The market most worth aiming at, as
the recently formed association of wool
textile manufacturers is aiming, is the
United States with its great volume and
high purchasing power. New Zealand
with 2i million people has only a limited
absorption capacity. Japan is a promis-
ing market, but what Japan seeks pri-
marily is raw and semi-manufactured
materials to be fabricated in its own
rapidly growing industries.
As industrial development proceeds,
there will emerge other markets in south
Asia comparable with Singapore; but
these markets are largely a function of
the economic aid available, much of
which requires tied exports from the
donor country.
The only market truly worthy of Aus-
tralia’s steel is the United States and
particularly the West Coast, its most
rapidly growing region.
The survey says that the emergence

of Japan as an export market, coupled
with the smaller exports of special items
to other Asian areas, has led to a wide-
spread belief that Australia’s proximity
to south and east Asia makes for a
natural trading partnership. The mas-
sive population increases and the ambi-
tious development programmes of the
Asian countries lend support to this
belief.
It may, indeed, be true that as deve-
lopment proceeds in south Asia, markets
will develop for imports of capital goods,
but these are likely to be closely tied to
the receipt of foreign aid. The Indian
five-year plans, for example, are postula-
ted upon foreign aid being available to
pay for all imports of capital equipment.
In view of the uncertainties of the politi-
cal outlook and of foreign aid pro-
grammes, it would be unwise to bank
too heavily on south Asian markets.
Countries in the early stages of econo-
mic development not only lack pur-
chasing power but inevitably try to
reduce imports of consumption goods so
as to maximise the foreign exchange
available for imports of capital equip-
ment and materials. They give the pro-
tection not only of tariff duties but of
import prohibitions and licensing of their
own infant industries. What these deve-
loping countries seek from the already
industrialised countries is capital, know-
how and technology as far as possible
in the form of foreign aid.
There is an increasing effort by the
industrial countries to gain footholds in
the markets of developing countries
through direct investment, usually in
partnership with nationals, the industrial
countries supplying modern equipment
and technology, including marketing
skills. In Asia, Japan is following the
same procedures.
Tf Australia is to compete in the Asian
markets with the developed tech-
nologies of the United States, western
Europe and Japan it must be prepared
to develop its own technology and tech-
nicians and export them through private
as well as public channels.
The recent formation of an investment
company to operate in south Asia is an
indication that this has begun to be
realised; but to gain an effective lodgment
in the developing countries on the basis
of which future trade may be developed
will call for an immense effort. The
greater part of this effort must be in
the development within Australia of its
own technology. This must be imple-
mented by vigorous exploration of in-
vestment openings in the Asian countries.
The routine operation of Colombo Plan-
type training and technical assistance is
not enough.
It seems probable, therefore, that Aus-
tralia must aim at markets with higher
purchasing power and equip itself with
the technology to compete in the grow-
ing market for highly technical manu-
factures such as electronic equipment,
as well as in basic steel and aluminium
products. In view of present tariff policy
in the United States, that country may
prove to be the market where Australia
could find its best outlet for manufactured
exports.
There are many chinks in the Ameri-
can tariff, the survey says, which are
steadily being enlarged in successive
tariff negotiations. To take advantage
of them requires a degree of technical
development and market research not yet
achieved but it would seem that the best
chance of Australia becoming a manu-
facturing exporter lies in the already
developed countries of high purchasing
power rather than in those at earlier
stages of development which are them-
selves attempting behind tariff walls and
quotas to establish their own manufac-
turing industries.


Hardboard Output Could Reach Record
Tariff Board may give protection against cheap imports
Housing approvals are up and
so, it would seem, are the figures
of the building material suppliers
and manufacturers. Hardboard pro-
duction and sales are increasing
and it seems likely they will con-
tinue their upward trend for a
long time.
A major problem with Austra-
lia’s only two producers of hard-
board is cheap imports, but a Tariff
Board report, they hope, will pro-
vide them with protection.
Unfortunately, because there are
only two producers in the field, and
consequently stiff competition and
closely guarded secrets, the manu-
facturers were reluctant to disclose
revealing figures but here is what
they told the bulletin last week.
Tncreased new building approvals have
affected industries connected with
building, and the hardboard industry is
no exception.
Production and sales are running well
ahead of last year’s figures, say the
manufacturers Colonial Sugar Refin-
ing and Associated Pulp and Paper Mills.
Figures from the Commonwealth Sta-
tistician for the first quarter of this
financial year indicate that Australian
hardboard production could reach the
record level of 39 million square yards
in 1963-64 compared with 1962-63’s
output of 33,712,000 square yards.
As an effect of the credit squeeze
hardboard production fell sharply from
1960-61’s figure of 31,085,275 million
square yards to 28,546,000 square yards
in 1961-62.
General marketing manager of CSR,
Mr Alan C. Higgs, said his company’s
sales of hardboard were up considerably.
“They are up because of improved acti-
vity in the building industry and we
expect the Menzies Government’s pro-
mises on housing will give a
further lift to the industry and
provide us with higher sales,”
he said.
CSR owns and operates three
hardboard factories —at Ray-
mond Terrace (NSW) with an
annual capacity of 9.2 million
square yards; at Pyrmont (Syd-
ney) with an annual capacity of
6.6 million square yards; and at
Bacchus Marsh (Vic.), capable
of turning out 6.1 million square
yards a year.
It also owns and operates four
processing factories for cutting
hardboard to special shapes and
sizes, coating it with painted,
printed and plastic finishes, and
fabrication of finished hard-
board components for various
uses.
The capacity of these factories
is 4 million square yards. The
basic raw material for producing
hardboard is eucalypt pulp-
wood, obtained from timber
which has no other commercial
use. About 50 p.c. of CSR’s an-
nual consumption of 140,000 tons comes
from their 75,000 acres of privately
owned forest. The balance comes from
State forests and timber reserves.
The company’s total capital invest-
ment in hardboard factories is about
£lO million including a factory at Eildon
(Victoria) which has been shut down
because of surplus capacity and technical
problems associated with the manufac-
ture of smooth, two-sided hardboard.
“But it may be possible to overcome
these problems and we may re-open the
factory”, Mr Higgs said.
“The company has available spare
capacity to manufacture an additional
2.7 million square yards of hardboard a
year. The reason for having this capa-
city available is that the trend of increase
in the total hardboard market determined
by a detailed survey in 1957-58 indicated
that the total Australian market in 1962-
63 would be about 35.5 million square
yards. But with credit and other restric-
tions in 1960 and the consequent lag in
the building industry the actual market
for 1962-63 was about 28 million square
yards.
“I believe we would be working at
capacity today but for the credit squeeze
and imports”.
Total consumption per capita of hard-
board in Australia is about 2.5 square
yards a year compared with Scandinavia’s
figure of 4.5 square yards and the United
States’ 1.5 square yards.
Mr Higgs said imports from Scandin-
avia and New Zealand were worrying the
local hardboard industry. “We submitted
evidence to a Tariff Board enquiry last
year that imports from those countries
were being dumped on the Australian
market. I believe we could get 50 p.c.
of this market if imported hardboard was
sold at more competitive prices”.
The Tariff Board report is due soon.
The bulk of hardboard production
goes to the building industry. Of the
balance most is used for furniture, the
backs of TV sets, and motor car panels.
“The home handyman field is very
small”, Mr Higgs said, “and while we
spent a lot of money on pro-
moting this we found it very
uneconomical. The industrial
uses market is growing, though.
Take for instance furniture. If
there are more homes being
built, more furniture will be
needed. So will hardboard for
drawer bottoms, wardrobe
backings and so on.
“For the future we see a
general expansion in the in-
dustry due to the development
of new uses and further develop-
ment of existing uses. And we
believe we can expand our ex-
ports. At present we export to
the East, the Pacific Islands, the
West Indies and America,’’ Mr
Higgs added.
Mr J. A. Hughes, marketing
manager of Burnie Board and
Timber Pty Ltd (a division of
APPM), forecasts a 4 p.c.
growth rate for hardboard in
Australia up to 1970. This
would result in a total demand
by that date of 39.6 million
square yards or 32 p.c. on to-
day’s volume. What might be asked by
those who rely on hardboard for a
portion of turnover and profit is: Will
the capacity for production be adequate
to supply the anticipated demand?
“Of this you can be assured and re-
assured,” said Mr Hughes. “Currently the
potential production is at least 30 p.c. in
excess of demand.”
The hardboard industry also has to
take into account the possible influence

“Plastic houses are talked about which
would be a factor affecting both timber
and hardboard,” he said. “There are
clear signs, too, that for some purposes
plastics need the support of sheet
materials for strength and rigidity”.
Australian consumption of hardboard
is the fifth highest in the world, accord-
ing to the United Nations FAO. We are
surpassed only by Sweden, Norway, Fin-
land and Canada.
Mr Hughes said recessions in Austra-
lia's economy had markedly reduced
hardboard production. To forecast the
future of hardboard in Australia one
needed to know when to expect the next
recession and to w'hat degree it would
affect production.
“Some forecasts say that the next
slump will occur in 1965-66 so we must
ask: Will that which was adequate in
the past suffice for the future, or are the
winds of change blowing?”
Consumption of hardboard in Australia
reached a peak in 1960 and declined to
1962. “It will not regain this lead until
1970 unless there is some success with
developments now in hand which could
materially change house building prac-
tices”, said Mr Hughes.
Population growth and trends, too,
will have an affect on the future of the
hardboard industry. There are indica-
tions that in 1966-67 there will be an
increased number of young people
reaching marriageable age.
Keeping Control
in the Family
fact that the Abel and Lemon
*“• family groups have taken a better
than half interest in the issued capital
of the newly floated Abel, Lemon Hold-
ings Ltd guarantees shareholders a con-
tinuance of expert management.
Julius Abel and Robert Lemon are
the joint-managing directors today. Mr
Lemon also acts as chairman. They are
the sons of the late Henry Abel and the
late George Lemon who, in 1920, merged
their partnership businesses in Mel-
bourne, Sydney and London into an
Australian-based company called Abel,
Lemon and Co. Pty Ltd, now an operat-
ing subsidiary of the public holding com-
pany.
The intricate knowledge w'hich fathers
and sons have held of their trade in the
past 44 years is illustrated by the fact
that a loss has never been incurred
during that time and staff has not once
been retrenched.
The indenting and merchandising of
raw and semi-raw materials for manufac-
turers are now major activities in addi-
tion to importing. The majority of opera-
tions are W'ith iron and steel foundries,
chocolate and confectionery manufac-
turers and merchants, and the bedding,
upholstery, tanning, brush and broom
making trades.
The Melbourne office in William Street
has been sold at a substantial profit and
modern premises are being built at Not-
ting Hill. Directors are also planning to
move from their Sydney office in Water-
loo out to Concord West. The Waterloo
land and buildings have been owned since
the early 'thirties, so a whopping capital
profit can be expected.
Although benefits will probably not
come as quickly as they have from many
other new floats, the genuine investor
will find that a holding will increase its
value slowly but surely in line with the
company’s conservative and extremely
secure policies.
The group's current financial position
makes it one of the most solid floats of
recent years.
Of the 1.4 million ordinary issued ss.
shares about 750,000 have beer retained
by the family groups, 400,000 were is-
sued to clients of Patrick & Co of Syd-
ney and D. M. Bennett & Co. of Mel-
bourne, the underwriting brokers, and
250,000 were allotted to 63 employees
who were shareholders with the families
in the original company. The shares are
obviously relatively tightly held.
The directors are expecting to pay
10 p.c. annual dividends a full dis-
tribution will be made in July for the
year to March 31.
This payout will be easily covered
by earnings. Average profits in the last
10 years equalled 16.9 p.c. on the paid
capital of holding company of £350,000.
Profit in 1962-63 was £69,563 equal
to 19.8 p.c. on that figure. During the
latest half-year to September 30, the
board said that sales and profits were
continuing at high levels.
A bonus issue could easily be made
in the near future as many of the proper-
ties are listed in the books at cost
those which are not were revalued in
1953 or before. On this conservative
asset value basis, the firm’s accountants
have calculated the net tangible assets
backing at 6s. per ss. share.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Bleeding the Country
Enormous profits go to oversea parents
Australians agree that a certain
amount of overseas investment in
Australia is a good thing. But our anger
flares up every now and then when we
read of Australian subsidiaries paying
their foreign parents dividends in the
100 p.c. vicinity out of profits taken
from the Australian public, which equal
a percentage on paid capital of well over
this figure.
A prize example of this exploitation
was reported in a Melbourne morning
paper recently.
“Minnesota Mining and Manufactur-
ing (Australia) Pty Ltd,” it said, “adhesive
and office machine group, lifted profit
by 21.5 p.c. from £662,122 to £804,208
in the year to October 31. Earning rate
on unchanged ordinary capital of
£650,000 increased from 102 p.c. to
124 p.c.”
The company is a subsidiary of the
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
Co. of the United States. Dividend for
the year was £500,000, or nearly 77 p.c.
on the issued capital. Dividend in 1961-62
took £1,008,235 from accumulated
profits—you can work that fantastic per-
centage out for yourself.
Our Government collected £1,090,021
in tax from the company during those
two years, but the American parent got
£1,588,235 in dividends. A laughable
state of affairs when one considers that
the profits were largely made on Aus-
tralian soil, with an Australian staff and
from an Australian buying public.
Explanation, Please!
Shareholders of Simpson Pope Hold-
ings Ltd. Adelaide-based manu-
facturer and distributor of household
appliances, are entitled to an explana-
tion from directors as to the reasons for
closing down the Morley (WA) factory
which manufactures sealed units for
refrigerators and engines for motor
mowers.
Last week’s report from directors
merely stated that one of the companies
in the group, Simpson Pope Ltd, was in
the process of closing down its WA
manufacturing subsidiary, Pope En-
gineering (WA) Pty Ltd. Several months
were expected to lapse before work
finally ceased and about 250 employees
would be affected, they said.
Beyond this shareholders are com-
pletely in the dark.
Perhaps a small clue can be had if
we remember back to November 15
when the chairman of the newly-merged
group, Mr A. M. Simpson, gave a brief
resume of the company’s position at the
annual meeting. He said Simpson Pope
Ltd, the producing unit for the group,
had lost £552,000 in the year to June 30.
But work was in progress to improve
efficiency through various methods, and
one of these was to concentrate all
activities in order to reduce the amount
of handling and transport.
Over the next two years, the cost of
improving efficiency was estimated at
more than £500,000.
It seems reasonable to assume, then,
that the closing of a WA factory will
help “concentrate activities” considerably
and, because of the State’s relative re-
moteness, greatly “reduce transport and
handling costs”. Of course, this theory
has a thousand loopholes in it; but, for
all shareholders know, the subsidiary
may be incurring huge losses. Surely
they are entitled to an informative word
from their board.

One of the smallest companies listed
in Sydney, Metropolitan is purely an
investment company and was known as
Metropolitan Mutual Permanent Build-
ing and Investment Association Ltd.
Dividend was lifted from 15 to 17i
p.c. Profit retained after this distribution
is only £3.
Metropolitan has not yet published its
1963 accounts, but at December 31,
1962, its investment portfolio was worth
£253,230 on the market, compared with
book value of £129,710.
Directors notified shareholders in the
1962-63 preliminary statement that the
net assets backing of the company’s
shares based on December 31 market
prices, was 275. 6d. They had previously
rejected the takeover offer, but O’Connell
is going direct to shareholders.
O'Connell Corporation is an invest-
ment financier that obtained listing
through the vehicle of the old Cleo-

Obviously it is in a hurry to build
up a portfolio.

Why I Like “Souths” for Return and Growth
Stability from early copper production
By ROGER RANDERSON
Whether one adopts the short
view based on possibly record
profits from lead, zinc and silver,
or the long view, based on increased life
and stability arising from its emergence
as a major copper producer by next
year, the outlook for a rejuvenated
Broken Hill South could scarcely be
more pleasing.
Yet it is surprising how little exact
knowledge about the company is
possessed by investors, while the old and
now discredited opinion that Broken
Hill South is “a company reaching the
end of its mining career and concerning
itself chiefly with investment” still crops
up in some quarters.
It takes a lot to entice a cautious in-
vestor like myself into the market for
’mining shares, but, having dug deeply
to find out all I can about the company,
I have bought some “Souths” and intend
to buy more.
Cynics are welcome to accept this as
a warning to discount my conclusions as
motivated by self-interest, but I am
encouraged to believe that readers
generally will be interested to consider
my assessment of the company’s position.
The picture which the chairman, Mr
G. Lindesay Clark, sought to place be-
fore the annual meeting in October,
1961, of “a large and progressive mining
company with diversified interests in all
major non-ferrous metals” is truer today
than ever it was.
11/fucH has been done since the slump
in base metal prices after 1956-57
to increase efficiency, diversify interests,
prospect and develop new mines, and
now B.H. South is ready to take full
advantage of the upswing in the world
trade cycle which promises a better level
of prices for some years ahead, even if
there is some recession from present
peaks.
Points for consideration fall under the
following heads:
• Rising profit trend;
• Steady investment income;
• “Life” of Broken Hill mine;
• Alcoa aluminium investment;
• Copper production at Cobar;
• Better prospects for Port Kembla
refinery;
• Capital requirements;
• Other mineral prospects;
• Investment points.
Net profit, which had been £1,969,430
<n 1956-57, slumped to £578,200 in
1961-62, but it recovered to £976,989 in
1962-63.
Recently published figures showing
greater outputs and higher grades of lead,
zinc and silver in the six months ended
December 31, taken in conjunction with
higher prices, suggest that the value of
mine production could easily rise by
£1,700,000 to about £4,750,000 in the
current year, 1963-64, if not a good
deal more.
Income from investments this year,
the chairman has already assured share-
holders, “will closely approach” the
amount of £634,695 received in 1962-63,
even though the company has sold its
bonds and most of its other listed
securities to switch the proceeds of
£2,898,000 into its aluminium invest-
ment and Cobar copper project.
1%/faintenance of investment income
1 will be made possible by higher
dividends from the following substantial
holdings in closely associated companies:
B.H. Associated Smelters (1,300,000 £1
shares), E.Z. Industries (1,727,192 10s.
shares), and Metal Manufactures
(1,988,555 ordinary and 53,263 prefer-
ence £1 shares).
Perhaps by dividend time in April we
shall be given an estimate of the 1963-
64 net profit, so that I shall not attempt
to guess it.
It suffices to state that 1963-64 should
bring a much higher earning rate on
capital, even when the latter is increased
by the call on contributing shares last
September and by the final call due early
this year.
Continuance of the 15 p.c. dividend
rate (increased last year from Ilf p.c.)
is thus assured. It will require only
£616,875 on the old fully-paid shares.
The new shares soon to be fully paid
do not rank for dividend before next
year. Whether the dividend will be in-
creased or not, however, depends on
1964-65 plans for capital expenditure.
It would be possible to regard B.H.
South as a solid investment offering a
reasonable yield, even if the company
were not on the verge of a vast new
phase of expansion that could bring sub-
stantial benefits to shareholders for 20
years or more.
It is true that lead, zinc, silver ore
reserves on the “Barrier” were estimated
to have declined by 100,000 to 1,270,000
tons in 1962-63. But “Souths” has more
lives than a cat. The company estimates
its ore reserves very conservatively.
Much depends on the co-operation of
the mining unions to make possible the
economical working of large known
tonnages of low-grade mineralisation.
One can assume that the issue of
450,000 shares to North Broken Hill in
1962 for its British-Junction leases and
recent capital expenditure at the mine
will have beneficial effects on the mine’s
life.
Meanwhile, the company is engaged in
unremitting geophysical work in the
Broken Hill district, with the object of
uncovering concealed new ore bodies.
From funds in hand or in sight the
company by June of this year could
complete its purchase of 3,663,889 £1
shares in Alcoa of Australia, although
a balance of £641,000 might be left
outstanding if the 1962 budget is adhered
to.
Together with 486,111 Alcoa shares
received in exchange for Western
Aluminium shares—in a company which
carried out the initial work on the great
bauxite deposit in the Darling Ranges of
Western Australia this constitutes a
16.6 p.c. interest in the integrated
aluminium project, which has works at
Kwinana and near Geelong, together
with large brown coal deposits to be
exploited ultimately for the purpose.
Alcoa, with rapidly-expanding local
and export markets, is expected to be
earning profits next year and paying
dividends the year after.
At least one-third of Alcoa’s net
profits, commencing with 1964-65, must
be distributed as dividends unless every
partner consents to the contrary.
1%/fucH more exciting is the fact that
next year Broken Hill South is due
to become a major producer of copper
from the CSA mine, with its two adjacent
shafts on the 11-mile lode at Cobar.
Early confirmation is due from the
company of its original plans. These
are the production of 325,000 tons a
year by June, 1965, and the doubling
of this rate to 650,000 tons by the
following year, 1966.
Following extensive diamond drilling,
especially between 1957 and 1961, the
company stated that “a fair estimate of
the potential of the CSA ajul Chesney
mines is 18 million tons of ore . .
and the average grade of the ore bodies
is 3.54 p.c. copper with an average width
of 31.5 feet.
Details may b'e found in the com-
pany’s 1961 annual report with sup-
plementary results from drilling of the
Chesney ore body in the chairman’s
address to the 1962 annual meeting.

This 1961 estimate of ore reserves
amounting to 18 million tons allows
nothing for tonnages that can be ex-
pected to continue in depths sub-
stantially greater than 3000 feet, as
indicated in the 1962 annual report.
Nor does it allow for possible further
discoveries justifying future mining
about the other old mines—Great Cobar,
Dapsville, Gladstone, New Cobar and
Occidental.
What is known already suggests that
the Cobar enterprise could have a long
life of 20 to 25 years.
Broken Hill South has planned a
highly mechanised operation, using a
safe and very economical method, which
avoids the dilution from open stoping
methods.
The company will have met a large
proportion of the capital cost of the
Cobar copper project by June of this
year, with the assistance of its partner,
Conzinc Riotinto of Australia, which
holds a minority 23£ p.c. interest.
It appears that almost £6 million will
have been spent on the Cobar copper
project by June, assuming that £641,000
of calls on the Alcoa shares are deferred
as originally intended.
The major part of £3,500,000
estimated to be required in 1963-64
jointly for Alcoa and Cobar will be
available from funds on deposit, sales of
securities of £257,000 since July 1, 1963,
and two calls on contributing shares.
Remaining capital requirements in
1964-65 will be reviewed prior to June
of this year.
A moderate capitalisation of the Cobar
enterprise has been made possible be-
cause the township was already in
existence and because of the ready
availability of rail transport, power
supply and under-employed smelting,
refining and casting equipment at the
Port Kembla refinery.
rPHE Electrolytic Refining & Smelting
A Company of Australia has been short
of feed for some time, and at present is
able to show only a small profit. Not
the least of the indirect advantages that
Broken Hill South will secure from
Cobar when the mine is working is
much larger dividends from its 60 p.c.
interest in E.R. &S.
The potentialities of Broken Hill
South are by no means exhausted by the
foregoing brief survey of its ramifica-
tions.
Regular and extensive exploration
work has been undertaken throughout
Australia in recent years. With the aid
of McPhar Geophysics of Canada,
using advanced methods, many extensive
geophysical anomalies have been found.
Mounting interest is attached to the
discovery only 30 miles south-east of
Adelaide, in the Kanmantoo district, of
a bed containing copper mineralisation.
The existence of a copper lode has
already been indicated by four diamond
drill holes. Drilling has revealed “en-
couraging values” in widths varying up
to as much as 400 feet.
The Kanmantoo discovery, in which
Broken Hill South has a 51 p.c. interest,
clearly justifies the increased drilling that
is now taking place.
No doubt the Kanmantoo prospect,
added to the Cobar enterprise, has given
rise to the suggestion that Broken Hill
South may become another Mount Isa.
Much more information, however, is
necessary to confirm or discredit this
belief, and it is important, therefore,
that the company should promptly
release drilling results.
the company is very
A strong. Shareholders’ funds of
£15,815,717 last June included reserves
of £10,503,277 against paid-up capital
of £5,312,440. Properties are well
written down and the book value of
investments last June was almost £lO
million, without allowing for current
valuations of interests in several great
industrial undertakings.
A generous dividend policy in the past
is likely to continue and be encouraged
by memory of the take-over bid.
Broken Hill South paid 170 p.c. divi-
dend when it earned its record profit of
£1,969,430 in 1956-57. The dividend
was cut from 75 to 15 p.c., following
the four-for-one bonus issue in 1961.
In making comparison with the past,
allowance should be made for the issue
of 450,000 shares to North Broken Hill
and the one-for-two cash issue at 7s. 6d
which, when it is finally called, will
soon bring paid-up capital to £6,112,500.
This compares with £BOO,OOO of paid-
up capital in 1956-57 and up to 1961.
As a rough rule of thumb, therefore,
one would expect present dividends to
be about one-eighth of what they were
on comparable profits before the
increases in capital. That is. until suffi-
cient revenue is coming in from almost
£lO million invested in Cobar and Alcoa,
which could double the company’s pre-
sent earnings by the year after next.
It all adds up to an increasing yield
from one of Australia’s greatest mining
investments, with almost certain capital
appreciation, apart altogether from the
effect that continuance of favorable
reports from the Kanmantoo discovery
may have on the company’s long-term
prospects and the demand for its shares.
Whatever the temporary quirks of
the market, I fail to see how genuine
holders can possibly lose by paying
present prices of around £1 for the ss.
shares. And this I say honestly, obeying
the dictates of my conscience.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Some Queries on ARC Industries
rpHE best time to examine a company
is immediately after the receipt of
the published balance sheet and prior to
the annual meeting in case some matters
arise from the examination that can be
explained at the meeting. Unfortunately
ARC Industries normally publishes its
balance sheet in October during which
month as many balance sheets are pub-
lished as in the ten months, November,
December and January to August inclu-
sive. Consequently the examination is
being made three months later.
The first two paragraphs of the direc-
tor’s report, following the figures for
the year’s profit and the appropriation
thereof, seem to give the major clue to
the year’s results. Profit margins are
lower and apparently were the cause
(we read later) of losses in two out of
the 13 trading subsidiaries. Turnover
was up 12} p.c. on the previous year,
but it is rather disconcerting to note that
stock and work in progress was up
181 p.c. and that trade debtors (before
the provision for doubtful debts) was up
14 p.c.
Another feature that could have
caused some concern was the increase
of £750,000 in unsecured deposits due
before 30/6/64, but the management has
already dealt with this by arranging for
a £l3 million issue of 7} p.c. unsecured
notes with currencies up to ten years.
Apparently part of this issue will be
used to retire a mortgage loan, so that
it seems likely that in the future, say
from 1964-65 until 1969-70, the interest
charge will amount to £124,375 from
the unsecured notes on issue.
IV/hile it is difficult for an external
" observer to assess the likely re-
duction in unsecured deposits, it seems
fairly safe to say that this short-term
borrowing will not be entirely eliminated.
Bank overdrafts were at a fairly high
level at June 30, 1963, and any further
increase might mean that the flexibility of
the group’s bank finance could be limited.
But it is impossible to make any judg-
ment without knowledge of overdraft
limits and the levels of the various over-
drafts throughout the year.
The possibility of any reduction in
the total interest charge over the next
five years seems fairly remote, and there
can be little doubt that the most fruit-
ful source for any addition to the
group's earnings would be the subsidia-
ries which have been making losses during
the last three years at an average of
£75,000 a year. Even so, the elimination
of such losses (so that the companies
concerned were only breaking even)
would increase per share earnings by
only one-tenth of a shilling.
Published balance sheets indicate that
subsidiaries have been making losses
for the last six years, and although
these losses have been substantial only
in the last three years, it is a sobering
thought to realise that nearly £250,000
has been lost.
Strangely enough, this same period has
been one of considerable expansion.
Fixed assets have increased by nearly
£2.3 million and trade debtors and
stock by £2.8 million over the last five
years. Part of this expansion has been
due to the acquisition of EPM Concrete
Pty Ltd and other companies, but in
the main it appears to result from the
direct expansion of the original business.
This substantial investment seems to
have been financed as to £1.7 million by
retained profits and depreciation, £l.l
million of equity capital, £1.7 million
of loan funds and £0.6 million from
current liabilities.
TTnfortunately, this investment does
not seem to have paid off as well as
might have been expected, for while
“total capital” (net working capital plus
fixed assets and investments) increased
by 179 p.c. over the period, gross profit
from trading and sundry revenue in-
creased by 99 p.c. Furthermore, gen-
eral administration and selling expenses
increased by 109 p.c. Turnover has been
given only for the 1962-63 year with
an indication that it was 12} p.c. higher
than in 1961-62.
It is fairly clear from the director’s
report that turnover is not related to
Gross profit but it is possible that it
is related to trade debtors and stock.
These two items increased by 191 p.c.
over the same period, which is in line
with the “total capital” increase,
It could well be that the investment
made over the last five years has
produced a roughly proportionate in-
crease in sales, but, as mentioned in the
director’s report, margins have been re-
duced by intense competition and profits
have not risen anywhere near propor-
tionately.
Despite the increase in gearing, 1962-
63 earnings per share were below the
1957-58 level, and it is difficult to be-
lieve that any substantial improvement
can be achieved in the short-term. For,
if gross profit has been increasing at the
rate of 15 p.c. per annum compound
without producing any increase at all in
earnings, one must wonder what rate
of increase will be necessary before per
share earnings start to increase.
Looking at the percentages given in
the company’s “Ten Year Analysis” it
would seem that, on average, per share
earnings over the last nine years have
been declining at the rate of 10 p.c. per
annum compound, but it must be admit-
ted that the series starts with the year
of the highest per share earnings (1955)
and ends with the year with the lowest
per share earnings (1963). However, it
is unanswerable that the earning rate in
1962 was lower than the earning rate
in 1954.
T'he record for the first seven years
from the time the shares were first
listed was quite a remarkable one, for
during that period per share dividend
increased at the rate of 15 p.c. per
annum compound, but for the last five
years they have shown virtually no
growth. However, the market value of
a constant holding of shares would have
increased by 60 p.c.
It seems fairly clear that the market
was disappointed by the “bonus” issue
made in November, 1962, for, although
the price initially reacted by rising from
the equivalent of 11s. 9d. to 13s. 9d. it
fell steadily from the latter figure to
reach a low of 10s. Id. at the end of
September. The last sale of 1963 was at
12s. and the dividend yield from that
price is 3.1 p.c. It would seem that the
rates of growth of 1951 to 1958 are ex-
pected to re-commence immediately and
continue for the next seven years at
least if this price is to be justified. To
meet the dividend requirement if divi-
dends are to grow again at those rates,
per share earnings will need to increase
at a minimum rate of 83 p.c. per annum
compound.
The revival in home building activity
should help the company to some extent,
although one would think that com-
mercial and industrial building would
have claimed the major share of the
company’s output. The present price/
earnings ratio of 20.5 is hardly justified
unless per share earnings increase to the
1959-60 level in 1963-64.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Better Profits Ahead for Fowler?
TV Fowler Ltd, held in high esteem
-*■* by discerning investors, is still
struggling to reinstate itself after a
troublesome year following the imposi-
tion of credit restrictions three years ago.
The latest disclosed profit of £90,765
was the best since 1958-59. Judging
by the 1962-63 tax provision of £82,650
(still high in relation to profit) trading
was not as easy as in 1959-60, when dis-
closed profit was closely similar at
£89,706.
Fowler is largely involved in sanitary-
ware, which depends on a prosperous
building industry and extension of sewer-
age. Vitreous china now replaces
earthenware, and new styles are being
introduced.
The company’s plants are at Marrick-
ville and Ryde (NSW), Thomastown
(Vic.), Alderley (Qld) and Edwards-
town (SA). The properties were re-
valued by £165,225 in 1960-61, and
one property was revalued by £20,160
in the latest year to September 30, bring-
ing assets revaluation reserve to
£403,548.
Besides sanitaryware, Fowler makes
wall and floor tiles and stoneware pipes,
but these are minor interests.
During the years 1957-1960 the com-
pany provided £85,000 for kiln replace-
ment. In the latest financial year the
pipe plants at Marrickville and Ryde were
improved by the installation of modern
machines and conversion of kilns to
automatic firing.
The latest profit was after providing
£7OOO against stocks compared with
£13,000 in 1961-62. The value of in-
ventories at 1963 balance date was
£421,426 less £77,000 provisions, a net
£344,427, compared with £281,988 the
year before.
Trade debtors of £350,830 were sub-
ject to provisions of £41,873. A charge
was made against 1962-63 profits of
£7OOO for doubtful debts.
A surplus of £15,000 provided for
tax in earlier years was brought back
into profit and loss appropriation accounts
in 1962-63.
Net tangible assets backing is now
14s. 9d. for each ss. share.
The company has a history of regular
profits and dividends since 1933. From
1951 to 1956 10 p.c. dividends were the
rule, then 124 p.c. for two years.
In 1958-59 the company made a one-
for-two bonus, then a one-for-two par
issue on the bonus-enlarged capital.
Dividend that year was 111 p.c., and 10
p.c. the following year.
In 1960-61 the sanitaryware market
in Australia was extremely competitive
and price-cutting developed. With excess
capacity in the Australian industry, the
company claimed there was no need for
the importation of sanitaryware.
No doubt the stringencies of the last
three years have improved the efficiency
of the company, so that with more
favorable economic conditions now
operating, shareholders should see better
profits this year.
The company is financially very sound,
with no long-term liabilities and a com-
fortable working capital position.
At 14s. 9d. the ss. shares yield a
modest enough 3.4 p.c., and although
directors will be cautious, after their
1960-61 experience, about recommending
any dividend rise, the shares could show
some price improvement if Fowlerware
holds its share of the sanitaryware
market.

WARRNAMBOOL WOOLLEN CO. LTD
The Two Keys to Success
HHighter Government protection against
-*■ woollen cloth imports and a reduc-
tion in the level of bad debts are the two
keys to success in 1963-64 for the
Warrnantbool Woollen Co. Ltd.
Unfortunately, directors have very
little control over the first key. They are
already engaged in an application to the
Government to reduce competition from
this direction and there is little else they
can do. The latest import figures avail-
able are for October and they illustrate
the reason for the directors’ concern — :
the company’s main products are
blankets and woollen piecegoods. Blanket
imports rose more than 17 p.c. from
£35,000 to £41,000 during the month
and woollen piecegoods imports gained
about 11 p.c. from £123,000 to
£137,000.
Of greater importance is the 52 p.c.
increase in blanket imports during the
four months to October 31 from
£109,000 to £166,000, although the
apparent seriousness of this increase is
offset by the fact that the company
balances on September 30, not June 30.
This situation is not made any
healthier Dy the increased blanket pro-
duction in Australia during the current
financial year.
The second key is something that
directors have more jurisdiction over.
Their annual report and balance sheet
issued to shareholders last month pointed
out that bad debts totalled £13,828 for
the year. Only £2OOO of this had been
provided for. This discrepancy made a
big hole in earnings which came out at
£33,634, slightly below last year’s
£35,831.
It is up to directors to organise a more
efficient scheme of debt collecting this
year and to avoid placing goods in the
hands of customers who may be unable
to meet their commitments.
The term to September 30 is the com-
pany’s 55th year of operation and will
probably be another unlucrative one for
shareholders, apart from their dividend
cheques. The ordinary and preference
holders have seen no capital moves by
the company since 1922 when 50,000
ordinary 20s. shares were offered at par
to lift paid capital to £150,000.
Nevertheless, a reasonably successful

year may turn the directors’ thoughts to
the unfortunate names on the share
register.
The latest accounts from the company
reveal a fairly healthy financial position.
Shareholders’ funds have risen steadily
over the past five years from £472,000
to £522,000. As capital takes only
£150,000 of this total, reserves are
fairly high at £372,000. There is ample
working capital to preserve liquidity,
and dividends have been easily covered
by the earning rate every year. Stocks
are now at their lowest for some time.
This position should be improved
during 1963-64 by the board’s continued
chasing of export orders.
The company’s overseas marketing
policies are extremely aggressive for such
a small company last year agents in
Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan were
visited twice and export orders were
booked in the USA.
In addition, the company sent a staff
member to the United Kingdom, the
USA and the Continent to study textile
production methods and machinery,
spent £22,000 on modernising equip-
ment and paid employees a bonus based
on profits, so directors cannot be too
unsure of the future.

HOUGHTON AND BYRNE H’GS LTD
Lowest Profit for 8 Years
lowest profit in at least eight years
■*- produced a temporary withdrawal
of support for the shares of the pest
control company, Houghton and Byrne
Holdings Ltd.
During December the shares fell to
their lowest point for the year of 10s.
9d., but quickly recovered to their pres-
ent level of 12s. 6d. to yield 5.0 p.c.
The earning rate on unchanged capi-
tal is still a comfortable 19.7 p.c., but
this is a considerable decline on the
1958-59 rate of 33 7 p.c. Dividend is
12! p.c. for the second successive year.
Actual profit fell from £49,869 to
£39,999 in the last year to June 30. The
tax provision was £25,664 compared
with £30,069 the year before.
Directors attributed the profit fall to
the loss of one of the chief distributing
lines when the manufacturers decided to
market it themselves. Several important
sole manufacturing and distributing
rights have been obtained to replace this
lost business.
The weather conditions, too, were un-
favorable in the second half of the year
under review. Excessive rain hindered
outdoor pest and weed control.
The company claims it offers clients
the most modern pest control service
available for white ants, rodents, fleas,
ants, borers, spiders, flies, ticks, cock-
roaches, bird mites and possums. It
handles the control of pests of grain,
stored products, tobacco and foodstuffs,
and the fumigation of ships, cargoes and
flour mills.
A major project in 1962-63 was the
methyl bromide fumigation of 2643
Queensland State Housing Commission
homes at a price of £257,000.
The company has recently developed
special services, including the proofing
and treatment of buildings against birds,
weed control to eliminate fire hazards
around industrial sites, and odour re-
moval.
Since listing in 1955 shareholders have
received no capital benefits. The high
earning rate has allowed a big build-up
of retained profits, currently £347,973
compared with capital of £203,000.
However, goodwill on consolidation
partly offsets this.
But for the present, the ss. shares
can be regarded primarily as an income
stock, and until tangible evidence is
available of a reversal of the profit
trend of the last two years, a price of
much above 12s. 6d. does not seem war-
ranted.

G. H. HORTON & CO. LID
Quiet but Solid
Stock
VS/hen G H. Horton & Co. Ltd, Sydney
" pencil, carbon and typewriter ribbon
manufacturer, transferred its plant from
Waterloo to Lane Cove in the 1962-63
year, it was only to be expected that
profit would be affected adversely.
Directors reported that production was
interrupted to a greater extent than had
been anticipated, and further new plant
would be installed during 1963-64.
Profit in the year to June 30 last eased
back from £83,684 to £78,226 after pro-
viding £57,100 (1961-62 £56,550) for
tax and £17,148 (£15,654) for deprecia-
tion.
New earning rate is 18.6 p.c. compared
with the previous 19.9 p.c. The com-
pany, therefore, cautiously lowered the
bonus dividend payment from 3 to 2 p.c.
so that the total distribution was 14 p.c.
compared with the 15 p.c. rate for the
two preceding years.
G. H. Horton was incorporated in
1919. It is associated with Columbia
Ribbon and Carbon Manufacturing Co.
Inc. of America and Columbia Ribbon
and Carbon Manufacturing Co. Ltd of
England.
In recent years shareholders have been
treated to two bonus issues a one-for-
two in 1955 and a one-for-five in 1961.
Present capital is £419,992 in 20s. ordi-
nary shares, which, though quoted in
Sydney, Newcastle and Melbourne, are
not frequently traded.
Last sale was at 645. where the yield
is 4.4 p.c.
The company appears content to
quietly keep its share of the market,
without launching into new fields.
As an investment the shares have
proved solid holding and should continue
to be so. Any intending entrants to the
company could wait until the stock falls
back around 60s.

Speculator’s Diary
T’m getting worried about 1964. It’s
losing its new-born exuberance.
The papers are getting so desperate
they’re having to resurrect both Elizabeth
Taylor and the Opera House —and you
must admit they do have something in
common. The market, too, has been
losing some of its initial enthusiasm. The
financial writers can do no better than
headlines such as “£2 Million Wiped
Off Tobacco Stocks.”
What exactly does this mean? Just that
there were a couple of early, panic sales
from which the market quickly recovered.
In the scramble I managed to buy back
at an average of 345. 6d. the 500 Roth-
mans I’d shorted the previous week at
375. 9d. Profit £52. Quite the most
successful shorting operation since my
wife took up cigars. But it wasn’t long
before that old saying about buying on
bad news was proved to be right again.
From tobacco it was back into sugar
and on into coffee. Commodities and
metals still seem to be the rage.
In sugar, I couldn’t help bur notice that
Pioneer was as weak as Gibson and
Howes was strong. In fact, over the last
six weeks Gibson and Howes has risen
10s., Millaquin 7s and Fairymead 6s. Yet
poor old Pioneer has been rock-steady
at 58s. That is, until I bought them when
they promptly shed a shilling.
However, sugar has been so good to
me in the past that I can’t see it failing
me this time. Particularly with the world
price firming up again and Pioneer, Fairy-
mead and G. & H. all due to produce
their results for the year to December
within the next month or two. And if
anything, Pioneer tends to be the most
dynamic of the sugar shares with its
backing from the wrong side of O'Connell
Street.
Next, in a moment of real speculation,
I bought some Palgrave. What initially
attracted me here was the company’s
claim that its Korfena Plantations (inher-
ited from Landmark) are the largest
coffee producers in New Guinea. And,
of course, the world price of coffee has
doubled in the last few months following
a bad year in Brazil. East African Cof-
fee’s shares have moved up strongly re-
cently, so, maybe, Palgrave will follow.
Of course, Palgrave’s past and present
activities represent a pretty mixed bunch.
In its time it has been involved in Main-
guard, Vanguard Insurance and Time
Saving Clocks (whatever they were). Now
its" operations cover everything from real
estate to the cleaning and exporting of
palm seeds and dried ferns. It also has
other Island trading activities which
should be cashing in on the improved
production and prices for copra and

Actually my man Leo tells me in his
latest despatch from Brisbane that I
should be buying Dylup. He’s probably
right, but for the moment I’ll take my
chance on Palgrave—even if the board is
suspiciously like Australian Factors used
to be.
Nevertheless a profit was earned last
year and in the circumstances 2s. 6d.
does seem to be treating the ss. shares a
bit harshly.
International Footwear —like Palgrave
■—is another of those intriguing com-
panies where a massive goodwill figure
is carried. Again like Palgrave, its history
has been somewhat spasmodic. Only one
year between 1956 and 1961 produced a
profit.
Shaking off these depressing blues, it
turned in a very reasonable profit of
£102,500 in 1962 and followed this up
with a profit of £152,600 last year.
This sudden change in fortune would
appear to be entirely attributable to the
reorganisation of the company in 1960.
The big one-for-two cash issue last Octo-
ber indicates the confidence of the direc-
tors in the future prospects of the com-
pany. The shares have meandered around
11s. for some months, but the coming
interim report should stir things up a bit.
On the selling side, 1 let go my remain-

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Unscrambling the Egg Industry
Board gives farmers a £25,000 Christmas box
A few weeks ago, Victoria’s poultry
farmers received from their Egg
Board a Christmas present of £25,000.
It represented a reduction of a farthing
a dozen in the cost of grading eggs, and
was the first time in anyone’s memory
that charges for the handling of eggs
had been reduced in Australia. The
Board intends that it shall not be the
last.
The reduction was one of the fruits
of the Board’s drive to make its opera-
tions more economic, and resulted,
specifically, from a closing of ranks in
the State’s grading floors to achieve a
larger scale of activity.
New South Wales, which produces
twice as many eggs as Victoria, has
already centralised grading, but Victoria
has become the first State in which the
saving from doing so has been handed
on to producers in the form of a cut
in charges. It is also the only State
except for South Australia, where special
conditions exist which, instead of
letting its Egg Board become a mono-
poly, has preserved a working union
between itself and private enterprise.
When the Victorian Egg and Egg
Pulp Marketing Board, to use its full
title, instituted a programme of regional
planning If- months ago, there were 24
grading floors in the State, all, except
for the Board’s own floors in Melbourne
and Ballarat, run by private operators
accredited as Board agents on five-year
contracts. Painstakingly, the Board is
persuading them to conform to a plan
for teducing the number of depots and
situating them at the centre of each egg-
producing region in the State. On com-
pletion of the plan in a year's time, the
number of grading floors will have
shrunk to six—two in the Bendigo area,
one at Ballarat, one in Melbourne and
one in the Shepparton-Euroa area.
TI/hen regional planning began, only
two floors in the State, both at
Bendigo, took in enough eggs to operate
economically. The intake the Board
considers necessary for economic opera-
tion is a minimum of 60,000 cases of
eggs a year, and ideally more than
100,000 cases.
In reflecting the outlook that Victoria
has traditionally expressed in its choice
of Governments, the Victorian Egg
Board’s aim has been to follow a middle-
of-the-road policy that combines the
efficiency of the profit motive with the
advantages of the scale that is possible
under Board control. At the same time,
it has always been quick to proclaim its
independence from the Government and
affirm its allegiance to the poultrymen
who own and finance it.
Before the Board embarked on a
clean-up two years ago, its image was
spottier than that of any board in the
country, but the example it has set in
putting its house in order has sufficiently
impressed the private operators associ-
ated with it to coax them into similar
reforms—although the power to renew
contracts has also played its part. At
the same time, the Board has had to do
plenty of pushing and shoving to over-
come the inertia that has confronted it
and has become embroiled in a series
of legal actions that betray the reluctance
of interstate traders to give up the plums
that dangled from the sloppy operations
on which the industry has hitherto relied.
HThe economy that brightened Christ-
mas for Victoria’s 6000 registered
growers when grading charges dropped
from 4.75 d. to 4.5 d. a dozen was only
a beginning. It Came from extra volume
alone. Further savings are anticipated
from other improvements, such as the
more detailed dissection of expenses, the
introduction of new processes and
plant, and a lifting of the standard of
personnel. Whether the savings find
their way into poultry farmers’ returns
or go to offset rising costs will depend
on factors in the general economy, but
either way the industry will feel their
worth.
The industry is experiencing this pro-
gress in conjunction with other lifts in
its fortunes. It still suffers from the
effects of seasonal fluctuations and an
economic structure in which prices can-
not be held against the pressures of
supply and demand for more than a
fortnight at a time, but there is more
stability than ever before.
Some of this has come from technical
advances, such as the use of lights in
sheds during winter to even out egg
production over the year; some from
more painful developments, like the
collapse of exports to the United King-
dom and the consequent flight of many
of the least efficient producers a
pruning that was largely responsible for
making last year one of the steadiest
the industry has known, with only two
or three alterations in egg prices com-
pared with the usual eight or ten.
The local shortage of eggs last year
and the unattractiveness of prices on the
British market have dried up exports of
egg pulp, and in the place of this trade
the Board has developed a much more
profitable one in eggs-in-shell to the
Persian Gulf, bringing yet another con-
testant into a market where the spectacle
of Australian States fighting among each
other abroad gives the customers some-
thing to chuckle at over their eggs.
Tn view of the industry’s problems,
rivalry within the Commonwealth is
bad enough, but when interstate jealousies
are maintained on export markets
responsible observers feel it is time for
action, and their hope is that the new
Council of Egg Marketing Authorities,
comprising members of all Egg Boards
in Australia and representing every
section of the industry, will use its new
national egg marketing plan to introduce
some commonsense.
Centralising of egg grading in Vic-
toria is setting an example in preparing
a basis for the tidying up of marketing.
Along with it, the Board has introduced
such technical innovations as refrigera-
tion at every point farm, transport,
grading floor, even distributors’ ware-
houses. Shops, too, will no doubt
eventually take the cue. Centralisation
has also speeded up the passage of eggs
from pen to pan.
All this is improving quality and giving
the industry substance for the advertising
and other promotional activities on
which it has lately placed more emphasis.
The Board is confident that by such
means much more can be done in the
field that offers the shortest route to
stability the home market and last
year’s rise of six per cent in domestic
sales has helped its optimism to spread.

A Surplus of Canned Fruit
Over eight million cartons to he marketed this year
Ane of the nicest things the British
could do for Australia this year
would be to develop a craving for
canned fruit.
In 1962-63, Australia s production of
canned deciduous fruits—peaches, pears
and apricots totalled 7,280,000 basic
cartons, each containing two dozen
30-oz. cans or their equivalent. All
told, in 1963 there were 8,033,000
cartons of canned deciduous fruits avail-
able for sale, made up from the
current year s production and stocks
carried over.
This is the largest quantity canners
have ever had to market in a single
year, but the situation is not without
its compensations.
The blessing the industry has most
welcomed in recent years was the
reprieve France’s intransigence over
Britain’s Common Market bid gave it
from losing the 12 p.c. preference that
enables ,t to keep its head above an
American tide that could engulf the
British market if this protection were
lost. The preference is also a shield
against rivalry from the Continent, where
fruit production is expanding, especially
in Italy, which serves as a back door for
American interests to finance their way
into the Common Market.
South Africa, while no longer in the
Commonwealth, still enjoys the 12 p.c.
privilege. Dutch pears don’t amount to
much yet, but could if Australia had to
share the British market with Holland.
Whether the European Economic
Community would insist that Australia
not on ] y [ ose j ts preference but bear the
common external tariff like any other
outsider was something against which
the industry until a year ago was holding
its breath. In such an event, Australian
produce would be overwhelmed by an
avalanche from the US, where growers
and canners are paid to strip fruit from
trees and destroy it when a crop gets too
big. With 90 p.c. of its production being
eaten at home, America can manipulate
prices for the dribble that is exported
any way ,t likes.
This possibility cast a shadow over an
Australian output whose vulnerability
grew as each year brought into bearing
or maturity thousands of peach trees
planted to replace those lost in the floods
of 1955-56 in Victoria and New South
Wales.
Ia the respite that has come from
the collapse of Britain’s Common Mar-
ket talks, Australia has done more than
congratulate itself. Even while the
threat still loomed, it was earning the
envy of rivals on the British market,
which takes 90 p.c. of its canned fruit
exports, by mounting increasingly better
promotional campaigns designed to get
Australian labels on to every British
shelf.
The efforts have increased since then,
and to them have been added campaigns
by fruit growers within Australia, caus-
ing a jump in home sales. These sales
now equal those of exports, which once
far outnumbered them.
Another triumph for the industry was
recent Federal legislation enabling an
excise to be applied on home sales. The
money that comes from this can be used
for any purpose that will help the in-
dustry, but among the uses to which it
will at first be put is the development
of new markets on the Continent.
Amounts will probably be devoted to
expanding the promotional programme
in Britain, and in the event of the worst
happening through loss of preference or
modification of world tariff arrange-
ments after the manner of proposals in

the famous Kennedy Round, the money
might go towards cushioning the impact
by stabilising export sales provided
clarification now being sought showed
that such a move did not conflict with
the rules of GATT.
For the Australian Canned Fruits
Board the aftermath of the Common
Market threat has consisted more of
determination than relief. It has kept in
close touch with the Federal Govern-
ment and Commonwealth Departments
to get the best terms for the industry
in dealings that affect it at inter-
national level, and has represented the
industry industrially with the same
diligence.
In a world that is simply producing
too much canned fruit for the money
that is available to be spent on it,
success for canners and growers can be
measured largely in terms of how much
money is spent on promotion.
The spending is done at several
levels, and outside Australia is confined
mostly to the United Kingdom. This is
our traditional market and the one
which, even if political evolutions mel-
lowed France’s attitude to Common-
wealth agriculture and Britain’s Euro-
pean aspirations were fulfilled, Australia
is so dependent on as to be synonymous
with survival.
VTo move towards the revival of
' European membership is likely to be
made by Britain before the election near
the end of this year, but leaders of Aus-
tralia’s canned fruits industry will not
forget proposals that are made from
time to time as an answer to the question
of how Britain might reconcile responsi-
bility with ambition.
One that interests them is a suggestion
that Australian canned goods be bought
in a lump by the British Government,
thus side-stepping the prohibitions of
the European Economic Community’s
tariff wall, but the likelihood of anything
so radical finding its way into the com-
mercial life of Britain is hardly strong
enough to cause many political twitches
in Australia.
In Britain, canned fruits share the
promotional activities of the Australian
Trade Publicity Directorate with six
other commodities dried fruits, dairy
produce, fresh fruits, wine, meat and
eggs. Each is controlled by a marketing
authority and each contributes an
appropriate sum to the total.
The Commonwealth Government
usually puts in twice the amount put up
by the industries, although the formula
sometimes varies. The result is a figure
of about £500,000 a year for Australian
trade promotion, and no one seeing it
being conducted could doubt that
canned fruits dominate it. And this,, con-
sidering the nature of the produce and
its needs and prospects, is probably just
as it should be.
As well, the bigger Australian canners
advertise their own brands separately to
the tune of a further £250,000 or so.
Indirectly, too, help comes from the
thousands of multiple stores throughout
Britain that collaborate with Australia
House and the commodity boards in
running promotional schemes. In
securing the co-operation of these
groups, Australia-got in early and today
enjoys a foothold which rivals like South
Africa have not yet managed to equal.
The latest addition to these avenues
of spending is the fund that will accrue
from the recently-authorised excise on
local Australian canned fruit sales. It is
anticipated that up to £500,000 will be
raised from this source.
These amounts might seem large by
comparison with those spent on the
produce of other industries that are not
so prone to competition at the point
where discrimination is keenest but the
Australian canned fruits industry, with
a further 25 p.c. expansion of output to
cope with before production flattens out
in two or three years’ time, may need
to spend every penny of it.
A mark of the effectiveness this kind
of spending has so far had is that in
spite of the difficulties, prices to
growers have remained stable for some
years and no decline is contemplated.
Pig Boom Looms
IS earing one of biggest “ups” in memory
T ikE those in the nursery rhymes, the
pigs of commerce have their ups
and downs. Present signs are that Aus-
tralia’s pig industry, at least in numbers,
is approaching one of the biggest ups in
memory.
Australia used to ship abroad a lot
of pigmeat, mainly to Britain, but since
World War II exports have all but dried
up, and today are just a statistical speck.
Likewise, whereas the industry less
than a year ago was pondering the fact
that Australian production had slipped
12 p.c. from the year before, it is now
agog at the prospect of multiplication
on a scale that has never before been
seen in this country.
In the last half of the old year, pig-
breeding increased spectacularly, the
country’s breeding-sow population swell-
ing towards the record level of two years
ago and promising to soar beyond it.
The explosion that is taking place is
the product of several factors, including
high prices, near-perfect seasonal con-
ditions throughout most of Australia’s
pig-raising areas, and an increase in the
popularity of pork.
The price situation is linked with
values for lamb and beef, both of which
have shown a local reaction to successes
on British and American markets.
People are tending to eat more pigmeat,
especially pork, as incomes rise and the
influence of migrants appears in eating
patterns. As well, although there has
been no sudden jump in population, the
postwar crop of babies, formerly only
statistics, has in the past few years added
a generation of mouths to the country’s
appetite.
One of Australia’s leading pig authori-
ties, Mr Les Downey, of the Victorian
Department of Agriculture, has such
respect for this appetite that he thinks
that while record slaughterings are in
prospect, especially if conditions favor
production of milk and grain this year
and next, the expansion will not depress
prices. Within the larger pattern, some
short-term fluctuations in supplies and
values are expected to occur because of
seasonal variations in availability of food
and small discrepancies between the pig
population and market requirements.
Consumption of pork has also been
influenced by the improvement in quality
that has taken place as producers learn
to breed and feed for leaner pigs.
The improvement has encouraged many
butchers to feature pork, preparing it
attractively, pricing it to compete with
other meats and pushing its sale.
The recent lifting by Victoria of the
last of the interstate bans that have
paralysed pig trading for more than

three years will also add impetus to the
industry’s growth.
Despite the pace at which demand for
pigmeat is rising, and despite the re-
assurances implied in the fact that local
supplies last year were augmented by
1900 tons from New Zealand, the ex-
pansion is not without risk. In any
multiplication contest between pigs and
people, there is no doubt who would win.
Overseas markets no longer provide
a safety-valve for over-production.
Australia’s record pigmeat production
was 127,000 tons in 1945, a figure that
represented a climax to wartime output
stimulated by subsidies on wheat for
stock-feeding. Of this quantity, 17,000
tons were exported. By comparison, of
the 1961-62 production of 120,000 tons,
only 1000 tons left the country.
Although it would be hard to get a
farmer to admit it, the pig industry is
better than most at taking knocks. Being
conducted usually as a secondary rather
than a primary enterprise, mostly as a
sideline to dairying, and because farmers
are not always so meticulous as they
should be about bookkeeping and cost-
ing, pig-raising is often allowed to form
a slow financial haemorrhage in an
operation where the loss is obscured
by transfusions of income from other
sources.
Farmers are happy with prices as they
are now, and they could probably fall
further before the smiles leave their
faces.
With no export outlet to supplement
its natural resiliency, the pig industry’s
best defence against over-production is
to keep improving quality. Quite apart
from combating the dangers of its own
vigor, the industry must improve to
meet the challenge of the broiler-chicken
industry, a newcomer that has overtaken
the pig industry in efficiency and shares
with it the distinction of being on the
way out of the luxury class and on to
the common man’s table.
Statistically, the industry’s demo-
cratisation is still token, for pork con-
sumption in Australia for the year ended
last June, accounted for only 121 b a
head out of total meat consumption of
2241 b compared with 971 b for beef
and veal, 52 for mutton and 41 for lamb.
Some observers see the scope in-
dicated by these figures as an assurance
that expansion need not mean depression,
but their confidence is based on the
belief that there is always a demand for
quality, and this puts the onus on
farmers who have already done much
but still have much to do.
