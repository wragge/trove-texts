Dunstable, situated in the
south of Bedfordshire, 36 miles
from London, takes its name from
the wool-market, or “staple,” estab-
lished there in the chalk downs by
the Augustine monks of the Priory,
which was founded by Henry I in
the 12th century.
The monastery maintained great
flocks of sheep on the downs; and
Dunstable wool was once regarded
as the best in England. The great
Norman Priory was dissolved in the
reign of Henry VIII and the domes-
tic buildings were all destroyed, to-
gether with the choir, transepts,
central tower and part of the nave.
The remaining portion of the nave
and the great portal are embodied in
the present Parish Church of St.
Peter and St. Paul, and are outstand-
ing examples of Norman architec-
ture.
Dunstable’s early 12th-century
Priory was the scene of the first
miracle play performed in England.
It was here, also, that Cranmer
annulled Catherine of Aragon’s
second marriage in 1533. Her first
marriage, at the age of 18, was to
16-year-old Arthur, Prince of Wales,
eldest son of Henry VII, who died
five months after the marriage and
was buried at Worcester in 1502.
Before the year 1643 Dunstable
possessed an Eleanor cross.

THE MAN OF DESTINY.
One of the most amazing facts about
Napoleonic literature is that the world
has had to wait till 1948 for general
publication of Napoleon’s own memoirs,
the most valuable surely of all the great
mass of documentation of his tremendous
era. Yet this is fact. His own account
of the Hundred Days and Waterloo, trans-
lated by Dr. Barry O’Meara, was pub-
lished in 1823— Historical Memoirs of
Napoleon, 1815. Perhaps half a dozen
copies are known today.
The rest of his memories were em-
bodied in a narrative dictated to several
members of his staff—Las Cases,
Gorgaud, De Montholon and the faithful
Bertrand—during the years he was on St.
Helena. There has been no modern
edition.
The original version gave the reader the
sensation of wandering alone in a murky
jungle, inhabited by restless kangaroos.
Its text was not consecutive, apart
from the fact that it was pulled
down into the depths of obscurity by a
deadweight of elaboration, comment and
irrelevancy. The part transcribed by
Gorgaud carried one suddenly from the
events of Toulon (1793) to those of the
Eighteenth Brumaire—November 9, 1799.
And one had to wait for De Montholon’s
chapters to fill in the gap.
Now, 125 years later, in Napoleon’s
Memoirs (N.S.W. United Service Institu-
tion : Faber and Faber) Mr. Somerset de
Chair, M.P., son of a. former N. S. Wales
Governor, has dredged up the original
manuscript, corrected in Napoleon's
own hand—if hand it can be called
without flattery—removed the rotting
garments in which it was smothered and
given it to the world at last in a form
worthy of its importance. Of the process
to which he has subjected it he says:
.... I have done no more than present
the self-portrait scientifically cleaned and
hung in a good light.
He has maintained the translation of
1823 —a very good, concise one. The only
liberty he has taken with the basic story
is to change the author’s classic, imperial
third person into the first person. This
may destroy its stately Caesarean
air of detachment and sometimes invest
it with a flavor of egotism and self-
conceit, but it makes for clarity and adds
wonderfully to the personality and general
power of the narrative.
Few men add to their reputations by
writing their autobiographies, especially
when they are fallen from great heights,
ill, without hope and inclined to be
querulous.
Napoleon is one of the few.
The test is that if all the other
books about Napoleon were scrapped,
this one would provide almost as com-
plete a picture of the man as anybody
could wish for, particularly of his mind,
his resilience, powers of perception and
initiative and of recovery, his originality
and simplicity of thought.
The dictator of the memoirs certainly
seems to have infused a sense of his own
dynamic power into them. As Mr. Walter
Elliott, M.P., wrote of the book: “It
contains Napoleon. You see him, you
hear him, you taste him, you smell him.”
There is, of course, a large hiatus in the
narrative. Virtually complete from his
birth to his triumphant return after the
victory of Marengo in 1800, it misses all
the succeeding 10 years, which include
Trafalgar, the Peninsula War, the Retreat
from Moscow and the stupendous cam-
paigns, of 1813-14,
Even so, each of the two sections—
the period from Corsica to 1800 and the
Hundred Days ending with Mont St.
Jean—Waterloo to Britons—forms a
concise story of an epoch.
One thing you sense from this volume
more than from any other which deals
with the little Emperor.. .that he was
beyond doubt a man of destiny, one
seemingly thrown up by Providence de-
liberately to meet the need which
Catherine II of Russia stated even before
he had sealed his fate with the
whiff of grapeshot on the Thirteenth of
Vendemiaire:
What France needs is a man of superior
intellect, skilful, courageous, above all his
contemporaries, and perhaps even his
century. Has that man been born into the
world?
He had indeed. None who consorted with
him seems to have doubted it. Before
the Empress asked her question, Paoli
was saying “You see that youth ; he is
a man for Plutarch’s biography,” and
the bluff General Dugommier, much
plagued by democrats, was growling to
the Committee of Public Safety: “Pro-
mote this young man to Brigadier-
General, for, should he be ungratefully
treated, he would promote himself.” And
who shall wonder, for at that time at 25
he had led a patriot expedition to North
Sardinia, had placated the rebellious
Marsellais, had generally performed
“delicate services” for the Army of Italy
and had been instrumental in the taking
of Toulon with which, he writes, “my
reputation commenced.”
Nobody can read of the manner in
which the jealous and ignorant dema-
gogues, who were directing the siege
much as some of our own politicians
would have conducted a similar event in
case of invasion in 1942, permitted him
to ride roughshod over their opinions
without seeing fate at work.
If any doubts did exist why he should
have so affected men and ruled them
they must fade before the revelation of
his instant grasp of the problems of the
Italian war, of his all-embracing
mastery of the details of geography and
their significance, the very basis of all
efficiency in strategic movement and plan-
ning, and of the prompt readiness with
which his measures were concerted.
There was scarcely a moment in those
first perilous years of his rise when he
might not have come to an end sud-
denly—in the advances on the fort at
Toulon when he received the only wound
of his life; in the period of contention
which followed it when he bearded the
Marseilles rebels and conquered them
with reason; even on the night of 12th
Vendemiaire, when poor Menou failed
to prevail over the Committee of the Sec-
tion in the Rue Vivienne and when he
stood, a tiny, unobtrusive figure in the
crowd and slipped away to consider
what he might do when “those who had
been at Toulon with the Army of Italy,
and the Members of the Committee of
Public Safety, who were in daily com-
munication with me proposed me as the
person most capable of extricating them
from their present danger, on account of
the promptitude of my coup-d’ceil and
the energy and moderation of my charac-
ter.” Combined, it may be added, with
all the dash of an A.I.F. subaltern, as
witness his account of the incident of
the bridge of Lodi;
I determined to make a last effort in
person. I seized a flag, rushed on the
bridge, and there planted it; the column
I commanded had reached the middle of
the bridge, when the flanking fire and the
arrival of a division of the enemy frus-
trated the attack; the grenadiers at the
head of the column, finding themselves
abandoned by the rear, hesitated, but being
hurried away in flight, they persisted in
keeping possession of their general; they
seized me by the arms and by my clothes,
and dragged me along with them amidst
the dead, the dying and the smoke. I was
precipitated into a morass in which I sunk
up to the middle, surrounded by the enemy.
The grenadiers perceived that their general
was in danger; a cry, was heard of “For-
ward, soldiers, to save the general.” Those
brave men immediately turned back, ran
upon the enemy, drove him beyond the
bridge and I was saved.
And he was then 26 years of age, master
of the armies of France and shorter and
a little less than the fighting-weight of
Billy Hughes.
His most stupendous achievement was
probably not the victories which cul-
minated in Marengo, or the campaign
after the retreat from Moscow, but in his
recovery of strength during the Hundred
Days.
In 1814, his manpower worn down by
the titanic two-front war which had gope
on for years and which culminated in the
campaign which Wellington thought his
best, his prestige and support had fallen
so low that his conquerors could not even
escort him to Elba without his being
subjected on the way to threat and in-
sult by his own former subjects.
It is necessary to go to other narra-
tives of 1814 to understand his own about
1815.
We see him, through the eyes of Neil
Campbell, making his way under guard
down through Avignon, huddled in his
cloak, fearful and trembling, sometimes
even disguised, upon the road. We see
Augereau in the flesh at Valence spitting
out “He is a coward! I always knew it.
He ought to have marched full-face into
a battery and blown himself out.” We
hear the shouts at Orange directed at
“the monster,” hear the rattle of blue-
metal on the roof of his carriage, watch
him blench as he beholds at Orgon the
dreadful effigy, all smeared over with
blood and hung with a placard. “Voild
done Vodieux tyran! Tot ou tard le crime
est puni!”
All this we see in the late days of
April, 1814, and 10 months later we hear
Cooke, the British Under-Secretary of
State, brushing aside the warnings of the
Commissioner that something was stirring
in Elba: “Nobody thinks of him at all.
He is quite forgotten—as much as if he
had never existed.”
Yet of the events of the week after
which this careless appraisal of him was
uttered Napoleon himself wrote:
I left the Island of Elba on the 26th
February, 1815, at 9 o’clock in the even-
ing. I boarded the brig Inconstant, which
flew the white flag studded with bees
throughout the journey. On March 1 at
5 o’clock in the afternoon I landed on the
beach of the Gulf of Juan near Cannes.
He had returned to the France which
had stoned him, secure in his faith in a
prophecy Which he had made a few
months before of what would happen
when the Bourbons’ new Government
restored property to the emigres and
ancient families —“Even I did not dare.
When I advanced these people the reins
trembled in my hands.”
Now he was back with an army of
1100 men to reconquer his old domain
and Europe. And what a fist he made
of it and how nearly he succeeded! With
his little column he plunged straight
across the rough mountains through
Grenoble to Lyons, the country rising
behind him in a cheering mass.
During World War II there was much
scoffing laughter among forgetful critics
when Hitler issued an order congratulat-
ing a hardy division which, upon the flat
plains of Poland, had marched 625 miles
in 21 days. Napoleon’s little column
covered 720 miles in 20 days. It arrived
to see the tricolor flying on the Tuileries,
Louis XVIII gone, and its leader, who
hastened in advance, guarded by 40,000
men of the Army of the Line.
Has there ever been such a stupendous
piece of organisation as was achieved in
the three months which was available
to him before the avalanche should de-
scend on him? At the end of March he
knew he needed 800,000 men to fight
Europe on equal terms before July 15.
He had about 100,000 infantry and 25,000
cavalry with 16,000 horses —11,000 fit
for campaigning. He presently had
revolt in the Vendee on his hands.
With enormous energy he turned the
whole of France over to war industry.
His picture is a living anticipation of
the measures of Britain in 1940. Even
the bronzeworkers, the locksmiths’
apprentices and the engravers were con-
scripted into the munition service. And
he had for defence to turn Paris and
Lyons into giant fortresses—an exercise
which produces an illuminating essay on
fortress defence as a means of fighting
defensive wars.
It was May before he had France
pacified. There was no longer any hope
of peace in Europe. The armies of the
different Powers were on the march to
the French frontier. Only then did he
decide between the two plans of action
which he had thought out.
The first was to abandon the north and
let his enemies, with their long lines of
communication and their limited and
polyglot armies, break themselves against
his interior fortresses of Paris and Lyons,
which they would scarcely be able to
attack before August. This would give
him more time to organise, apart from
the chance it presented to force the
enemy to leave 140,000 men behind to
guard the 42. frontier fortresses, and to
spur on the western and southern pro-
vinces of France to increased warlike
effort through the imminence of danger
to their own actual areas.
His second plan was to forestall the
Allies and start the campaign on June
15, going to meet them before they were
ready, their deadline being July 15. He
reckoned that it would be possible to
have 140,000 men in Flanders by June
15 while leaving a cordon of defence on
the frontiers and good garrisons in all
the fortresses. This procedure would, he
thought, avoid the terrible inconvenience
of abandoning Flanders and the rest of
the north-east without firing a single
shot and give him breathing-time to get
his Alsace-Lorraine Corps ready, so that
he would have an adequate force to meet
the Russians and Austrians when they
approached later.
But was it possible for 140,000 men
to beat two armies—the Anglo-Dutch of
104,000 men under arms, the Prussian-
Saxon of 120,000 men? He thought it
was, because quality balanced quantity:
One Englishman, or two Dutchmen, or
two Prussians, or two men of the Con-
federation could be counted as equivalent
to one Frenchman. The enemy armies were
quartered under the command of two dif-
ferent generals and formed from nations
divided in interest and opinion.
In his account of the campaign there
is little that is not logical and which
does not support the dictum of Wel-
lington that Waterloo was “damned
serious... .the nearest run thing you eyer
saw in your life.”
Napoleon clearly admits his own mis-
judgment after the first onslaughts l and 0
the lack of tactical advantages gained
from them—“l had, by skilful manoeuvres,
won a smashing victory, and divided the
two armies. It added considerably to my
glory, but had not yet sufficiently im-
proved my position.”
This was a very conservative view in
the light of Wellington’s summary of the
results of what the Emperor had done:
Blucher lost 14,000 men on Friday night
and got so damnably licked. I could not
find him on Saturday morning; so I was
obliged to fall back to keep up my com-
munications with him.
Napoleon originally intended to attack
on the afternoon of June 17. He believed
he would have won, since he would have
had Wellington to himself, and an
advantage in terrain. But Grouchy’s
incorrect appreciation of Prussian move-
ments and his loss of touch with Blucher
changed ail that. He became sure that,
in prudence, during that night of rain
the Allied armies would ooze rearward
through the forest of Soignes and array
themselves as one force to meet him with
superior numbers and on their own
ground before Brussels.
He did not know of the British certainty
about the Prussian intentions. He did
not know of the scene in the anteroom
of Bliicher’s h.q., where poor Hardinge,
“passing the night (of the 17th) with my
amputated arm lying with some straw,”
found himself embraced by a human bear
smelling strongly of gin and rhubarb who
called him lie her Freund, apologised that
“Ich stinke etwas,” since medicine had
been needed to offset the effects of be-
ing ‘‘twice rdde over by cavalry.”
Blucher told Hardinge that, despite the
feeling of Gneisenau that they should
fall back on Liege, he thought that in
conjunction with the Duke he would be
able to defeat his old enemy. Napoleon
overrated the wood as a factor, and he
did not know that even if Wellington had
moved it would have been towards Ant-
werp rather than Brussels. ■
At eight o’clock on the morning of
June 18, Napoleon says that, with 90,000
men against his 69,000, he felt that he
had “a nine-to-one-on chance of victory,”
for in the enemy army only the English,
who numbered 40,000 men at most, could
be counted as such. This contradicts
Ney’s statement that at that time he
poured scorn on the English as bad
troops.
Whatever the argument about the
rights and wrongs of victory, it is certain
that if Grouchy had joined the main
French force and Blucher had not arrived
in the nick of time —he was two hours
late for his appointment and got into
action only after the sun had gone down
--the history of the war might have been
changed.
From the 15th to the 18th the Duke of
Wellington manoeuvred continuously as I
wanted him to; he did nothing that I feared
he might. The English infantry was firm
and sound. The cavalry could have done
better. The Anglo-Dutch army was saved
twice during the day by the Prussians;
the first time before three o’clock by the
arrival of Marshal Billow with 30,000 men;
and the second time by the arrival of
Marshal Blucher with 31,000 men. Dur-
ing that day 69,000 Frenchmen defeated
120.000 men. Victory was snatched from
them between eight and nine o’clock by
150.000 men.
All of which does not alter the fact
that Wellington won the campaign of
Waterloo —or that Bonaparte’s figures
are exaggerated. Military students will
find it interesting to compare his ac-
count of the battle with that in the French
communique of June 21, 1815, and with
that which Ney gave to Fouche in his
letter of June 26.
Afterwards the Emperor must have
regretted that he did not follow his first
plan to make the enemy come to him
instead of going to them. Wellington
thought he should have done that:
Napoleon (he once said) had never so
fine an army as on that occasion. He was
certainly wrong in attacking at all. There
were four armies going to enter France—
before the harvest —and in a country much
exhausted by the last campaign. We
should have been reduced to many straits
for subsistence —in fact, I don’t hesitate
to say that the Prussians were already in
great difficulties. As for me, I have always
taken especial care of the subsistence of my
troops. Napoleon might, after providing
for other frontiers, have stationed himself
on the Meuse with nearly 300,000 men. He
might have played again the same game
that he played so admirably in 1814 —the
campaign I consider the finest he ever made
—he might have manoeuvred from one in-
vading army to the other and attacked them
separately He might have given us great
trouble and had many chances in his favor.
The Duke pretty accurately summed
up the man who fought his finest cam-
paigns after the retreat from Moscow, who
found new armies to light’ at Dresden and
Leipsic, who had raised' the whole of
France a few months after he had sneaked
out of it in fear of his life: “The fact is,
he never in his life had patience for a
defensive war.” Even in these memoirs,
dictated when he was ill, exiled and with-
out hope, there is little sign of the de-
fensive, or admission of defeat.

Who were the “Currency lads and
lasses” of the early days, and why
so called ?
In the early days, owing to a
chronic shortage of English-minted
coin (known as “sterling”), Mexican
and other coins, tokens issued by
tradespeople, and even merchandise
were in use as currency, and known
by the term —as distinct from “ster-
ling.” In course of time the terms
came to be applied to the population,
“sterling” signifying English-bom and
“currency” the locally-born young-
sters.

(1) When were convicts first sent
to W.A. and when did the practice
cease? (2) Details of the ships that
were prevented from landing convicts
at Port Phillip ?
(1) Western Australia, which was
free from convictism in its early
years, first received convicts in 1851
at the request of the settlers, who
were urgently in need of labor to
develop the country. Transportation
to the colony was discontinued by
the British Government in 1852,
largely as a result of the represen-
tations of settlers in other States
(where the practice had long ceased),
who were anxious about the infil-
tration to their territory of ex-convicts
from W.A. (2) The incident of the
diverted shipload of convicts occurred
in 1849 in Port Phillip, where, ignor-
ing local opposition, the British Gov-
ernment attempted to land convicts
from the ship Randolph, but public
outcry forced Governor Latrobe to
divert the vessel to Sydney, whence
it was sent on to Moreton Bay. A
second ship, the Hashemy, was
similarly diverted, and the attempt
was not renewed.

How to tan opossum skins by
sulphuric-acid and bran process?
After scraping, trimming and wash-
ing in hot soapy water, the skins are
placed in the acid-bath, made thus:
For every 1101 b. of pelt, use 25 gal.
water, 221 b. salt and 2ilb. sulphuric
acid, or reduced quantities in propor-
tion. Leave for 3 or 4 hours. The
bran-bath is made by scalding a quan-
tity of bran and allowing it to fer-
ment in a pit or vat; when fermen-
tation is complete, the skins are
immersed until they have risen three
times. They are then removed and
washed, and usually go on to further
tanning by one of the bark methods.
If the skins are good it is cheaper to
send them to a tanner-furrier, the
acid process being destructive in in-
experienced hands.

How to make cheese from goat s
milk in a hot climate?
Coagulation is difficult without
rennet; natural souring in a hot
climate is likely to produce putre-
faction. Take 20 quarts or propor-
tional quantity of goats’ milk and
coagulate with rennet or tablets
according to quantity directions
Separate curds from whey in a
colander. After a few days the curds
may be shaped into cheeses, salted to
taste, with or without caraway seeds
or other flavoring. They must then
be turned every day, sprinkled with
salt lightly and any mould removed,
then put away on shelves to ripen;
if weather very dry, rub over with
butter. Three or four weeks usually
required for ripening. Twenty quarts
of milk will make about 41b. cheese,
which should be even and firm all
through. Fairly cool conditions
essential.

How to treaj (1) leather chairs and
(2) book-bindings which crack and

(1) Gum raised bits in place firmly.
When dry go over cracks and light
spots with brown shoe polish applied
with a flannel until color is restored,
then polish with white or brown cream
used for kid shoes or gloves and finish
with a silk duster. (2) Treat with
cream as above, but proceed care-
fully and sparingly; polish with silk.

Who was Von Mueller, in whose
honor a commemorative stamp has
been issued?
Sir Ferdinand Jakob Heinrich
Mueller was born in 1825 in Ger-
many, of Danish parents, and, after
he had studied chemistry and botany,
arrived in Australia in 1847. He
worked for a while as a chemist,
also made important botanical in-
vestigations throughout the country,
and published papers on Australian
flora. In 1852 he was appointed Govt.
Botanist in Vic., where he continued
his botanical studies, including in-
vestigations in the unexplored Alpine
country, and in other areas. He
accompanied Gregory as naturalist
on the Victoria River expedition,
conducted exploratory work in Tas-
mania, and assisted in several other
ventures. In 1857 he was appointed
director of Melbourne Botanical
Gardens, which owes much to him.
In 1871 the King of Wurtemburg
bestowed on him the hereditary title
of Baron (Von Mueller), and he also
received honors from practically
every European country. He wrote
many books and papers, and died
in Melbourne in 1896.

I From whom, when and where did
Jim Jeffries win the world’s heavy-
weight championship, and who beat
him for that title? Is Jeffries still
alive ?
Jim Jeffries won the world’s heavy-
weight championship (knockout, 11th
round) from Bob Fitzsimmons at
Coney Island, N.Y., U.S.A., on June
9, 1899. Jeffries retired unbeaten in
1905, but returned to the ring, and was
beaten by Jack Johnson (knockout,
15th round) at Reno, Nevada, U.S.A.,
on July 4, 1910. Jeffries, who recently
was able to walk after recovering
from a paralytic stroke he had about
two years ago, is • living in a Los
Angeles suburb. Born at Carroll,
Ohio, on April 15, 1875, he is now
in his 74th year.

By the swell of the deep.
BRITISH TRADE AND AVIATION.
Money figures can be very
deceiving these times, the buy-
ing-power of the pound sterling
having sunk so much since
1939 ; and when one hears that
July exports from Britain were
a record at £145 million some
doubt may still remain as to
whether this is all it seems. Not,
perhaps, all it seems: but the ex-
ports were a post-war record by
any standard, and (for the Sep-
tember quarter) 38 p.c. higher
in volume than in 1938. The
volume of exports for the April-
June quarter was 134 p.c. of the
1938 level, compared with 126
p.c. for the first quarter of the
year and 118 p.c. in the last
quarter of 1947. At what cost
in living standards to the home
population these increasing ex-
ports are being achieved only
the Briton himself (perhaps
more particularly Zierself)
knows ; but there is evidence in
the statistics that, despite Social-
ism, Marshall aid, etc., Britain
is making a real effort to bridge
the trade gap that has become
something of an economic night-
mare since most of Britain’s
overseas investments were sold
in conducting World War 11.
For a period in 1948 Britain was
the biggest car-exporting country
in the world.
Civil aviation, now socialised,
is still losing huge sums of
money. Passengers carried
during 1947-48 increased by 50
p.c. over the preceding year’s
total, and were three times as
great as the number carried by
pre-war British companies; but
losses, not yet completely calcu-
lated, are officially forecast as
being “slightly larger” than in
the preceding year, when they
were £10,300,000.
At present 8.0.A.C. and
B.S.A.A. are facing “intense and
growing commercial competi-
tion on major trunk routes,” and
are having to use “stopgap types
of converted military aircraft”
in competition with modern
commercial types operated by
foreign airlines. Where the
British corporations are using
Constellations and similar air-
craft they are fully holding their
own. But the Tudor II has been
a bitter failure. Hopes are that
the Handley-Page Hermes will
be available to British com-
panies in 1950, and that “the
real British post-war types” will
be in service early in 1953.
Before that it is hoped to have
Saunders-Roe 10-engined flying-
boats on the South American
run, introducing a 26-hour ser-
vice between Britain and Buenos
Aires. The bigger equipment
programme contemplates the
purchase of De Havilland
Comets, Bristol Brabazons and
Ambassadors, as well as
Handley-Page Marathons. But,
says Lord Pakenham, apart
from the Hermes, until these
new types British
airlines face a black prospect
over the next four or five years.
To help out 22 Canadian 40-
passenger pressurised aircraft
(Canadairs) have been ordered,
no immediate dollar obligation
being involved. “Fly British,”
the Minister asserted, remained
the ultimate objective, but “Fly
' Commonwealth” was a good
substitute meantime. Orders to
the tune of £25 million have
been placed with British fac-
tories for aircraft.
Summing up. Lord Pakenham
said the future of civil aviation
remained very obscure. Eco-
nomically it was still a chancy
business. Much depended on
international political problems
and world economic recovery,
and the extent to which nations
subsidised airlines. Yet it seemed
certain that over the next decade
there would be an enormous in-
crease in the amount of travel
by air, which should lead to a
great reduction in the price.
Within the British Isles there
was the ability to design air-
craft, to manufacture aircraft, to
fly aircraft and “to organise
aviation that will enable us to
benefit to the full from its great
development.”
One thing Britain has up its
sleeve, and that is a long lead
on the United States in the de-
velopment of jet aircraft.


O'Brien's
By BRIAN JAMES
ETERNITY and Infinity are well
enough for the mind of man to
toy with, but maddening when any
real attempt is made to grapple
with them. The years and miles are
meaningless in these the grandest of
abstractions: for our lives and our know-
ing are set in'such definite limits of time
and are so strictly defined in space.
For that reason—if reason has anything
to do with it —I find the ocean, and great
plains, too, oppressive to the spirit: these,
with all their known limits, stand as
symbols of endlessness. But not so with
the starry skies, for they are the great
dome of my temple, set with myriad
lights; immense, but still ip the range of
my imagining; or a great stage whereon
is played the drama of the storm ; or a
great canvas on which are painted the
dawn and eye and the miracle of summer
cumuli.
The sky, too, is friendly, intimate, a
reflecting of our own moods and longings,
ambitions and dreams. It sympathises
with us. And to see the sky we must
look up. Looking up is good for the
heart, and helps us to set a new value in
kinship with the kindly earth where bur
short days must be spent.
MOUNTAINS also must be looked up
to, and the act is at once one of
reverence and love. Not only are the eyes
raised, but the heart as well. No one
looks at *a mountain and feels himself
dwarfed by comparison, or does not
thrill to its friendly greatness or does not
desire to scale its sides, however difficult,
and set foot at last on its top. And then
it is right and fitting that one should look
down, as the gods look down, upon a
good and wider earth- The climbing is
not mere love of adventure and flirting
with danger ; it is much more than that—
a raising and ennobling of the soul. On
the contrary, who wants to descend the
mighty deeps of the Pacific? Foolish
thought maybe, but who would wish to
be buried in them, take his final rest there,
in preference to some high place beneath
the stars?
I was born among mountains, not the
giants of the world, but the little com-
panionable ones that many called hills,
which is poetic ; and others called ridges,
which is prosaic. But to me they were
high. The earliest picture in my memory,
more vivid and clear I think than any
sight of yesterday and to-day, is that of
O’Brien’s Hill, as we called it. And the
earliest ambition I recall was that of
climbing to the top, I don’t think I
could walk then, hardly crawl, for my
memory goes strangely back not merely
to early years, but to early months, with
a vividness of certain sights and sounds
that it seems now a gazing upon some-
one else’s life and not my own.
THE Hill, on our side of it at any rate,
rose straight from the gully floor. It
dominated the whole scene to north of us
—in fact, it was the whole scene itself.
And never since do I see a mountain
but O’Brien’s Hill stands beside it; and
no matter the height but O’Brien’s over-
tops it still . . . O’Brien’s was thickly-
wooded then, as hills should always be,
masses of trees in the main that had no
individuality except that of forest. Later
these trees resolved themselves into the
box, grey and white; gums, brown, red
and slaty; wooflybutts, and cabbage-
trees —with their clean white trunks,
cleaner and whiter than any tree ever
was; the apple-tree, softer in its foliage
jfrftn the eucalypts, massive in form.
grotesque in its upper limbs,
and a glory of creamy blos-
som in December ; she-oaks—
ridge-oaks they called them —
feathery in appearance, and
every small tree singing its song
in every breeze that blew —a
shrill song, at once happy and
sad; and here and there the
cypress, dark green, tall and
straight, with a chaste dignity
in their precision and sym-
metry.
Later, too, the smaller things of the
wooded hills came to my consciousness:
the wild cherry chief of these, a cheerful
bush with its long leaves a deepening
lemon in color. In the spring its small
bright-red fruit were gathered and eaten,
not that they were nice, for they were
very astringent, but because they could
be eaten. There were five-corners, dumpy
little bushes in the open spaces, and strag-
gling outlines under the big trees. The
five-comer was the very king of all the
bush fruits, with a pleasing, almost raisiny
flavor, but small —only a thin layer of
green flesh over a disproportionate, hard
oval stone. Its long trumpet-flowers were
pretty, too —red and yellow, and so were
the shapely leaves, narrow, sharp-pointed
and darkly green. These were the gee-
bungs, the small-leafed variety, a queenly
little tree it was, gracious yet dignified in
its pendulous soft-green leafage. The
fruit was yellow, sharply lined with
streaks of red, as large as a hazel-nut.
It had no better flavor than the wild
cherry, but was esteemed, too, for the
same reason: a gluey layer of flesh be-
tween rind and stone, and about as palat-
able as unripe persimmon.
There were the wattles in great variety
of size and shape and perfume. And
nearer to the ground were the clumps of
the bluebells —at least we called them
bluebells, and I have never learned their
proper name.
In the spring these rather drab clumps
came out in thin clusters of small bells,
bright blue as the spring sky above them ;
and then- surely they were the very earth
smiling. And shy, too—willing enough* to
be admired where they grew, but wither-
ing as soon as they were plucked. And
the everlasting daisies—yellow, hard, with
petals the very shards of golden beetles;
flowers made of finest enamel.
Orchids —dainty orange in color, sway-
ing on thin stems that rose from between
their two long sword-shaped leaves.
Yams we called these, for below the sur-
face were the two roots —much prized
and fit to be eaten —one root was white
and floury, and the other drab and
watery . . .
All these and many more in tree and
shrub and bush were the cloak and
mantle of O’Brien’s Hill. But in the
earlier memories one tree towered above
all —an immense slaty gum with a long
white trunk that rose above the smaller
trees. The tallest of timber dince then has
always that slaty-gum standing beside them
—and always a little taller than they .. .
AN auntie lived with us in our early
years. She was mother’s sister, but
relationship and resemblance ended there.
Auntie Kate was very re-
ligious, and it was she, as
soon as we could lisp at all,
who taught us our prayers,
and how to kneel and hold
our hands when saying them.
Her religion, as I think of it
now, was more than a trifle gloomy, and
its chief end and aim, it would seem, was
to escape Hell, an extremely difficult feat,
even when you started early. That nearly
everyone was going to Hell was small
consolation, for it was an awful place,
and the compensations of friends and
companions counted for nothing at all.
Heaven was certainly the place to go
to, but Auntie Kate didn’t make Heaven
overattractive either —its chief advantage
was that it offered escape from Hell.
Otherwise it was a dreary and nebulous
sort of happiness that unfortunately went
on for ever. God had to be loved as a
duty, but He wasn’t really likeable at all.
He was too much given to snooping,
prying and visiting unheard-of punish-
ments on small people when they least ex-
pected it. And He seemed terribly
touchy, too. You never knew how to
take Him or get along with Him.
On the other hand, the Devil was,
though abominably wicked, much more
attractive as a personality. And he liked
a bit of fun, too. Certainly there was a
price to be paid—but the point was that
you got something for it. He was a
vigorous, ranting, roaring fellow; hail-
fellow-well-met ; slap-on-the-back, full of
amiable pleasantries: come-and-see, have-
a-look, just-try-this, and stuff-and-
nonsense-to-all-that . . , That was the
Devil. He got you in the end,
but he did look after you well in
the meantime .., Later he was promoted
to Satan, a stiff and starchy name —and it
probably never did the Devil much
good . . .
1 MENTION Heaven and Hell because
1 O’Brien’s Hill became very closely
associated with them. Perhaps there is
something natural and instinctive about
this —for didn’t the gods live on high
Olympus peak, and didn’t one enter the
Underworld at Cumae? So the high top
of O’Brien’s was Heaven, or near it; and
from there God surveyed the world of
His making, and kept a pretty good eye
on all His creatures. That lent awe and
majesty to the Hill, but the watching busi-
ness was a pity. It might even have spoilt
the Hill for us, but it didn’t. My first
great wickedness was a lie —told to shield
mysejf for stealing, a great sin, too, but
not nearly so bad as lying. The truth
was extracted by a sharp prod on the
head with a thimbled finger. It hurt. I
was at the advanced age of three at the
time, and so old enough to realise how
cross God was about it all. Auntie Kate
insisted that I make it up with Him there
and then ; and tell Him how sorry I was.
I was sorry, especially as the thought
came that God wore thimbles, too —on all
His fingers.
Hell was right at the bottom of
O’Brien’s. There were many holes in the
gujly, and any one of these could lead to
Hell. And from the gully and the base
of O’Brien’s quite often the Devil could
be heard calling in a pleasantly mono-
tonous voice. “Four o’clock! Four
o’clock!” he said over and over again.
Later on I had good reason to suspect
that the voice was that of the dove.
Sometimes the gully “came down” after
a sudden summer storm, and the broad
swirling yellow water was a great sight.
It did not last long, however, and the
flood seemed to disappear into the
ground, which was something of a
mystery, for Hell was a very dry place,
we were told, and one of its many in-
conveniences was the shortage of water.
OUR home was built on the slope of
another hill which never received
more naming than Our Hill. It was really
just as high as O’Brien’s, but it didn't
it. One only saw the long slope,’ but
gained no impression of the outlines of
a mass of mountain. You couldn’t see it
was a mountain, and so it never compared
with O’Brien’s. But behind Our Hill there
was a real mountain, which I did not get
to know till much later, though the name
of it goes back to earliest of memories.
A fine name it was to conjure with —
Mount Stockley. There’ was a gold reef
on Mount Stockley—so it was said —a
very rich reef, and only waiting to be un-
covered. Stockley was a baker in town,
but a most romantic dreamer for all that.
He neglected his business, and spent his
time and money in looking for the reef.
He put in potholes wherever a bit of
quartz poked its nose through the ground.
He put down shafts through the hard
rock. He dug tunnels into the sides of
the mountain in the hope of catching the
reef that way. But he didn’t find the reef,
and it is still there.
However, after his tickling and tortur-
ing the mountain so much, and going
broke' in the process, it was only fitting
that the mountain should be named after
him. Mount Stockley was wilder and
more rugged than O’Brien’s. Darker and
somehow gloomier—-for its forest was
mostly cypress. But Stockley’s dream
became our own*, and we would all be
rich “one day,”
s —■■
Mother used to tell us that father was a
great friend of Stockley’s, and nearly went
broke, too, in the quest for the reef, I
never knew father, for he was already
dead when I was born, but I have always
greatly admired his castle-building—on
the solid and secure foundations of
Stockley’s Reef.
Mother said that his share of the wealth
—to come—was spent, in advance, in a
great number of most admirable projects.
First of these was the clearing-off of the
church debt. There was an enormous debt
on the church, and it worried father
greatly. I don’t know why, for it is a
poor sort of church that hasn’t-a debt
upon it.
With a magnificent gesture, I imagine
a splendid wafting of the right hand,
father was going to wipe that debt right
away. That nobly done, father planned a
scenic drive that spiralled round and
round Mount Stockley, and rose right to
its summit. And there would be built a
residence —a modest sort of mansion or
castle —and pear by a very up-to-date
observatory, where father could pursue
his passion for astronomy. Possibly this
venture would have been costly, but
almost any fancy can be indulged when
you have a good reef to fall back upon.
Father had other schemes, too ; among
them were world tours and the sending
of the children to Europe to finish off
their education. And there were other
trifles—rthe establishment of an experi-
mental farm ; a yellow coach and four
grey horses; the building-up of a first-
class private library, but which would be
free and open to all who liked. That
coach and four-in-hand was something
for the imagination to conjure with, and
I can still see it careering round that
spiral road to the top of Mount
Stockley . . . Nigh on sixty years has
father lain mouldering in the little
cemetery a mile or two without the town.
I can only hope his dreams go on —a
kindly Providence could give him no
happier Heaven . . .
THE other hills of our youth were dis-
tant, features only of the world we
lived in: there was the solid blue rampart
of the Ranges, beyond the town and the
lazy river. They were good to look at, not
with that affection for O’Brien’s, so
keenly and consciously felt that it became
a happy pain—if such a thing can be.
These Ranges were as remote and in-
accessible as the moon, the very end of
the world, and unimaginable void lay
beyond them. Fascinating, too, were their
changing lights and colors according to
the moods of the day—blue as the
sapphire when the skies were untroubled,
and purple in the sun’s setting; or again
dark and frowning when the big storms
gathered and grew upon their tops. Some-
times, but this was rarely, a light snow
was sifted over the Ranges, and this
looked warm and pink as it took the first
of the morning sun,
I had never set foot on the Ranges, and
I don’t think I ever really wished to.
They were beyond our compassing, and
when I \vas old enough to explore them
our family was already preparing to leave
the district.
Since then —so many now are the
vanished years—l have seen many moun-
tains, and climbed many of them. Not
the real giants—Andean and Himalayan.
These I shall never see now, nor do I
greatly care. But there are some for
which is revived a part of that childish
love and awe and reverence that I had for
O’Brien’s Hill.
FIRST among these is Buffalo in Vic-
toria, solid, humped and dark, with
a threat and a dare—“ Climb me if you
can!” And I climbed it, not in its im-
possible places, but difficult enough
too . . • There is old Feathertop, the
w


grandest and most inspiring mountain I
shall ever see ... A turn in the road
along the noisy Ovens, and there is
Feathertop before you, a-glitter in its
deep winter snow, purple under a summer
sky . . . The Bellenden Ker in North
Queensland with its mass of forest —not
trees but one great living tree itself . . .
The Pyramid at Gordonvale, almost a
perfect cone and a fitting place to view
the kingdoms of the earth . . . Cape
Guardafui on Africa’s farthest east —a
cape and a mountain rising sheer from the
ocean floor. No feeling for it but that
of wonder . . . The Rigi, not so high
among the Swiss peaks, but glorious for
view of valleys and Jakes and rivers . . .
The Jungfrau—a lovely name for its
chaste blushing . . . Ben Lomond, seen
but* once from the steamer on the Loch-
grim in its late-autumn garb, but romantic
in its songs and stories . . . Those Hills
of Dublin and Wicklow of lovely loneli-
ness where to follow the old military
road to Avoca on a day of soft mists is
to ride along the very roof of the
world . . . Galty and Knockmealdown
—among the lesser mountains —but not
in all of boasted Scotland are there finer
and bigger heather-bells , . . Macgilli-
cuddy’s Reeks—sombre foil for set-
ting and clasping the rare gems of
Muckross and Leane . . . But not a one
of them all of as fine a thrill as Feather-
top seen from the valley at Smoko. Not
a one of them all that ever tugged at
heart-strings as O’Brien’s Hill . . .
T HAVE not seen O’Brien’s these thirty
t years or more and I never wish to see
it again. I did hear on excellent authority
that a progressive sheepman bought it
and “improved” it. “Improving” in Aus-
tralian language is a horrible euphemism
for raping and ravaging the delicate earth.
The sheepman “rung” the hill so that a
few more blades of grass might grow. He
left the Hill bare and naked and ashamed.
The gracious garment of pine and box
and gum was ruthlessly stripped from
shoulder and body. And all the hidden
ribs began to show —boulder, rock and
lean outcrops of sharp slate. And no
grass either anv more.
O’Brien’s Hill can remain only a part
of my youth, and the reality of my
Heaven when I die. But it must be
O’Brien’s as 1 knew it long ago.
SUNDAY MORN ING
AT JULES PLACE
BY JAMES HACKSTON
THE old log was lying not far from the
house at a spot which, for some
reason or other, was still called the
woodheap, although there was seldom
any wood there. It appears that it had
received its name and was a woodheap in
the earlier days when Jules first came
and had carted a stack of wood to the
spot, and the log was part of it.
The log had been so long there that it
had become settled and accepted as a
fixture and permanent part of the place
and was on the same footing as the
corrugated-iron tank, the old trap under
the quince-tree, the shed and the sheep’s
skull by the tank.
Sometimes on a Sunday morning ex-
hibitions of axemanship (theoretical) were
given; right and wrong way to swing
Douglas. These exhibitions, during which
their axes were never brought in rough
contact with the hard log for fear of
taking the edge off them', were very popu-
lar with near and axe-conscious neighbors,
who found it much more interesting to
talk Douglas and show fancy cuts or
strokes than to stay at home and cut a
supply of wood for the home.
They used to come over and give
points, expound their views and talk over
the performances of the great master axe-
men of the past and their wins at the
different shows. Many professors of the
blade in this district had attended the
log in the’ past to let Jules and his friends
ffiave the benefits of their wide knowledge
of technique and wizardry.
Sometimes there’d be arguments be-
tween the left-handed and right-handed
axemen, and on one occasion young Tom
Sutherland (left) had taken his coat off
to Jim Rawlinson (right), and Jim Raw-
linson had then taken his coat off, and,
this done, both contestants immediately
put their coats on again and sat down
again.
THEY’D bring their axes over and
rub the handles with as much affec-
tion as if they’d been rubbing the soft
cheek of one of the town brides; take
the sheath off the blade with all the care
and love of a mother putting a napkin
on her first baby. They’d breathe proudly
on its edge, and sit looking admiringly
at it.
This done, they’d put the napkin on
it again and then lean the axe gently
and proudly against their leg and keep
it there: guarding it protectingly, not
letting it out of their sight, and if one
of the dogs did manage, while the axe’s
owner was busily engaged in animated
conversation, to make use of that axe
as a makeshift for a tree, side of the
house, gate-post, Jules’s cabbage-patch,
the water-tank or other such popular
places with the dogs, then there’d be hell
to play from the owner of that axe much
to the joy and loud laughter of the other
owners whose axes had not been so foully
contaminated.
It was fine to see these theorists posing
their axes so artistically, correctly and
gracefully; hear their learned voices
theorising on the best way to swing
Douglas. It was invigorating to see them
so engrossed in their art, so immersed
in theory; see the axe slicing through
a theoretical log like a knife through
cheese; see the big chunky theoretical
chips as big as a man’s head flying
through the air and the smaller chips
(also theoretical) hurtling past like gravel
before a charge of dynamite.
But sometimes Susan would most
thoughtlessly interrupt the learned
session by calling out rudely to Jules for
the axe so that she could cut enough
wood to cook the dinner and the axe
(Jules’s), which at the moment, maybe,
was being used for a realistic and prac-
tical demonstration on the log, would
have to be temporarily surrendered to
her, and waited for, while she knocked
a chunk or two off one of the rotting
stumps near by which Jules was going to
grub some day. However, everybody
(including Jules) good-naturedly put up
with such aggravating interruptions and
waited patiently until the axe was free
again.
Scattered about the “woodheap” were
the chips of the past when the woodheap
had lived up to its name. The more
opulent chips lay farther out, rotting
among the old sardine- and condensed-
milk-tins, burnt-out pot, bucket with holes
in it, battered kerosene-tin, frying-pan
without a handle, broken teapot, child’s
doll with one glass eye missing, the re-
mains of Susan’s “best” dinner set
(wedding present), old vest of Jules’s
and, among the obnoxious weeds that
were slyly, slowly and surely creeping
on the “woodheap,” an old hat of Susan’s,
one of her cast-off shoes of a time when
she could wear a six and not a nine as
she wore later and also, with its nose
turned up and, for some inscrutable
reason or other, wearing what looked
like a grimace or grin, one of Jules’s old
boots which he’d worn the day he was
married.
HOWEVER, the “woodheap” was the
most important place on the farm.
Everything seemed to revolve around and
about it; it was part of the communal
life of the household. Whenever there
was anything lost or missing it was “See
if it’s down by the woodheap!” or “I
think I saw it down by the woodheap”
—hence the accumulated rubbish of the
years. And when a snake was foolish
enough to come poking about the tank
and be killed, it would be hung over the
log for a period coinciding with the time
a dead snake is generally allowed to hang
on most fences.
This provided a fine break in the lives
of the animals about the place. The
fowls could cock their heads at the cor-
rect angle and look obliquely at the
exhibit; the rooster could stand alertly
by with one foot raised, head upright and
with one piercing live eye directed sky-
wards ; after which would come his quick
jerky movements, statuesque poses and
a series of unusual subterranean rum-
blings as if coming from deep down in
his gizzard.
As for the young bull calf: he’d stand
well off with a look of awareness in his
lovely eyes and old Slinks the blind-in-
one-eye-and-going-blind-in-the-other dog:
he’d walk stiffly round the snake, lifting
his legs up stiffly and precisely and putting
them down again as stiffly as if he had
the stringhalt in the whole four of them.
Polly, on her way to the cow-shed, and
past the exhibit, would lower her head
as she passed with the same suggestion
of deep earthy knowledge about her as
she gave the day she pawed the ground
about the dead cow. As for Duke the
horse: he’d tilt his ears back a little and
look down his long white nose, giving
the impression of a Judge on the bench
looking over his glasses at a most un-
savory witness.
Puss, however, would walk by without
taking the slightest notice, and would
look as if she were absolutely unaware
of the presence of the dead snake but
for the extra springiness in her careful
sinister tread and a noticeable brightness,
a greener and still more baleful light
illuminating her aloof, cold, cruel, mur-
derously clear eyes.
And as for those humans who knew
all about everything; they’d squeeze the
dead snake to feel the wriggle which,
according to some, dead snakes only pro-
vide between the hours of sunrise and
sunset; and, not forgetting Jules, he
would also walk round and round the
dead snake, and maybe lift his feet a
little higher, too ; sort of subconscious
like, and declare loudly that it was the
longest tiger or brown snake ever killed
in the district; after which he’d add a
foot or so on to its length and tell them
in the town later on about the great
length of it.
OLD SLINKS used to attract some
attention from visitors on a Sunday
morning. Polly was just a cow and no-
body in Jules’s district was interested in
what breed Polly was; Duke was just
an old horse and it did not matter what
Duke’s pedigree was, either, and the same
applied to the cat, the calf, Lily of the
Valley the sow, and the rooster.
But with a dog it’s different; for it’s
always “What breed is he?” and when
a dog’s a mongrel then it’s —with a
smirk —“Pure-bred, is he?” So they used
to argue about Slinks’s breed, some say-
ing that they thought Slinks had a bit of
the kangaroo-rat in him; others that it
looked to them as if he had more of the
wombat in him, and there were others
who reckoned he had a strain of the
bandicoot in him, and so the bandicootites
and the wombatites and the kangaroo-
ratites would argue it out, and after
they’d settled it, talk dog, skite dog, lie
dog and get dog sentimental.
But there used to be gatherings some-
times of men who were not axemen;
but who were also artists at passing the
idle moment and who were technically
perfect, in their way, at extracting interest
out of sitting perfectly still for long
periods without saying anything. And
they got a lot of interest out of their
silent gossiping. It had its advantages,
too; no aVswering each other back; no
arguing ; no losing temper and no trouble
in the district about what they thought in
their minds about the' people passing
along the road. These silent gossipers
relied on passing road traffic to feed
them with subjects over which to raise
eyebrows, click heels together, look
mysteriously at tree-tops, spit and whistle.
TAKE the case of young Will Lock-
ington riding past and whistling like
a thrush at the mating. Everybody knew
he was on his way to “Big” Holberg’s,
the butcher, Will knowing well that
“Big” Holberg had taken his three wolf-
hounds and gone shooting wallabies.
Also, everybody knew Holberg was the
best rifle-shot for miles round, and when
Jules and the rest of them would see
George Canterbury, as he sat like a shag
on the log, screw up his left eye mean-
ingly as if taking careful sight, and then,
after a while, unscrew it suddenly, the
club knew that “Big” Holberg was shoot-
ing Will Lockington; and after the
echoes of George Canterbury taking sight
had died down then Dave Dunkellen
would click his heels together, which
would be read as saying that it was only
what a man who chases after another
man’s wife could expect.
And after the candid and knowledge-
able click had subsided, there’d be an
interval without movement wherein they’d
all study their feet with set faces which
said that they were all deeply sorry that
young Will Lockington had come to such
a tragic end. But when Jack Harbuster
would go driving past their technique
would change and the club purse the lips
and whistle simultaneously, which, in this
case, meant that the biggest liar unhung
was going past!
When there was no traffic on the road
to sit and be silent about, the club mem-
bers would rise from their seats and then
simultaneously, and abstractedly, walk
very slowly a ud, with perfect rhythm,
begin to sway slowly towards a patch of
faded grey which was fenced off by a
wild barricade of blackberries. After
pushing gingerly through the thorny out-
posts they’d reach the dark space which
was the entrance to the shed and where
there used to be a stout slab door but
which now, with its one remaining rusty
hinge sticking out desperately, leaned
obliquely against the side of the shed,
which also leaned.
THEY’D pause here and, looking like
a statuary group against the darkness,
stare into it. Then their feet would
suddenly come to life, but only their feet,
and the different pairs of boots would,
as if independent of the bodies above
them, take an interest in their surround-
ings. To begin with. Stringer Howell’s
or someone else’s right boot would un-
earth, say, an old nut and turn it over
inquiringly. Now was it off a chaff-
cutter or a harrow?
After this boot had carefully examined
it, it would push the nut over to the
left boot, which would, in turn, also
turn the nut over and then shove it
along to Squid Farrell or someone else’s
boots and they, in turn, would turn the
nut over inquiringly, and uncertainly,
and then shuffle it over to Jules’s boots,
and his right boot would give it a touch
with the toe and, as a dexterous reply to
all the other boots, give a kick and send
ffie nut rolling away into the shadows.
The matter had been settled.
After such discussion the boots would
then begin to break company and stray
over the rich brown of the shed’s floor;
the inside of the shed begin to take
shape; a beam of light repaint the red
hub of the old cartwheel; a bright silver
highlight illuminate a buckle on the old
winkers and George Canterbury, maybe,
go over and look carefully and steadily
at the old winkers, and recognise them
as his. After this, and to add a fresh
note of interest to the tour, they’d
adjourn to the other end of the shed
and insist on bending down and squeez-
ing through a hole in that side of the
shed and then, single file, follow a weedy
path that dodged round the plough,
circled round the discarded tub and then
led them to the trap beneath the old
quince-tree, where the poets would slide
a friendly hand along the rim of a wheel
and then, after getting their legs tangled
in the loose pieces of barbed wire that

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
DR. EVATT AND MR. LIE.
As already noted here, most
American comments on the
Evatt-Lie letter to the Powers
involved in the Berlin dispute
were prepared to give Aus-
tralia’s peripatetic “foreign
policy” the benefit of the doubt,
but tore into Mr. Lie very
severely.
One exception, William Henry
Chamberlin, highly - regarded
writer on world affairs, did
without mealy-mouthed distinc-
tions and lumped the pair of
them together in a charge of
“undermining U. N. from
within.” Their “uncalled-for
and ill-advised” intervention
“undermined the prestige and
moral authority of the United
Nations,” and rejection of their
interference “might have been
phrased in much stronger
language than the American,
British and French Govern-
ments saw fit to employ”;
“A brief review of the estab-
lished facts of the Berlin dis-
pute should indicate the gravity
of the error which Lie and Evatt
committed and the very bad ser-
vice they have rendered to the
organisation in which they hold
important positions. The refer-
ence of the Berlin blockade to
the U.N. was not a hasty or
reckless step. It followed weeks
of patient effort to explore the
possibilities of agreement in
Moscow. Toward the end of
August Stalin gave the Ameri-
can, British and French repre-
sentatives the impression that
such an agreement had been
reached, with only minor details
to be worked out on the spot in
Berlin.
“But the Soviet military com-
mander in Berlin, Marshal Soko-
lovsky, refused to carry out the
terms to which Stalin had con-
sented in Moscow. He de-
clined to consider measures to
ensure four-Power control of the
issue of Soviet-sponsored marks
in the former German capital.
He demanded the curtailment
of the air-lift, the sole means by
which the Western Powers' have
thus far saved the population of
the Western sectors of Berlin
from starvation. More than
that, he obviously instigated and
sanctioned a series of rowdy
attacks by German Communist
—Chicago “Tribune.”
“I WONDER IF IT’S REALLY THIS COLD OR
IF HE’S HAVING ME ON?”
strong-arm squads on the head-
quarters of the democratically-
elected German municipal Gov-
ernment.
“When complaints in Moscow
brought no satisfaction the Wes-
tern Powers referred the matter
to the United Nations. The re-
sult was what might have been
foreseen. Nine members of the
Security Council, all members
except the Soviet Union and its
Ukrainian satellite, voted for a
resolution recommending that a
lifting of the blockade be fol-
lowed by a renewal of four-
Power discussions on the cur-
rency issue. The Soviet Union
vetoed this proposal,”
Describing this as “only one
of a long series of contemptu-
ous defiances hurled by the
Soviet against the authority of
the United Nations,” and giving
examples in support, Chamber-
lin concluded:
“By backing down from the
resolution endorsed by all the
non-Russian members of the
Security Council, Evatt and Lie
resorted to the discredited
methods of appeasement and re-
treat in the face of an aggres-
sor’s defiance. They placed a
premium on the truculent Soviet
tactics. They gave a talking-
point to Soviet propaganda, im-
paired the solidarity of the West
and lowered the moral authority
of the organisation which they
represent.”
Atlantic Pact.
Stages still ahead before an
Atlantic Pact can be an actu-
ality include, says “U.S. News
and World Report,” a formal
conference —“a big show” —at
which the Western Powers will
sign the treaty.
The place given for that is
Washington ; time, probably late
January or early February.
But the main hurdle will come
after that: the treaty will have
to be ratified by the Govern-
ments concerned. In the U.S.
that calls for a two-thirds Senate
approval.
Sponsors of the pact are re-
ported as assuming that all stages
will be completed by June. Since
it is “Russia’s interest to wreck
this timetable if it can,” the
“U.S. News and World Report”
suggests that ending the Berlin
blockade and moving towards a
peace settlement for Germany
might make quite a difference to
the pact-planning, the implica-
tion being, of course, that the
Kremlin might therefore make
those moves at the right time.
London “Times,” while stat-
ing editorially that “so much
preparation has been quietly
done on both sides of the
Atlantic that there is no reason
to fear a setback,” added that
such an arrangement as the pact
“must seem a revolutionary ex-
periment” to the American
people: “Nor must it be for-
gotten that the Constitution of
the United States itself forbids
any automatic commitment to
go to war.”
The “Times” further com-
mented :
“A great deal will obviously
depend on how far President
Truman’s Administration will be
able to commit the United States.
If it is possible to judge by such
previous examples as President
Wilson’s draft treaty of 1919,
which was rejected by the
Senate, or the Treaty of Rio de
Janeiro, which now provides for
the mutual defence of the Ameri-
can republics, it will never be
possible for the United States to
do more than promise assistance
in the event of attack, without
defining in advance the form
which assistance will take. Yet,
at least so long as American
troops remain in Germany, this
will not be of vital importance.
What matters is the assurance of
steady and practical support and
the confidence which such a pact
would bring to the countries of
Western Europe. Only when the
pact has been signed will it be
possible to arrange measures of
defence on a wide and rational
basis. Only then will it be pos-
sible to approach such nations as
Norway, Portugal and Iceland
with a definite proposal,
“More important still will be
its effect on relations between
East and West. At present the
great questions which divide the
Soviet Government from the
Western Powers—-Berlin, Ger-
many, atomic energy, and so on
—remain unanswered This
uneasy waiting period cannot last
for long. It is of the greatest im-
portance that the Western
Powers should use this interval,
not merely to postpone difficult
decisions, but to strengthen
themselves and their cause and
to perfect the co-operation which
already exists between them.
There is no better way to do this
than by signing a North Atlantic
pact. Only when the West has
clearly marshalled its defensive,
economic and moral strength
will a possible way be opened
for practical arrangements with
the East.”
The “Times” added the warn-
ing that on the subject of the
proposed pact “American
opinion can by no means be
taken for granted.”
On the same warning note,
London “Times’s” correspondent
in Washington has stated that
discussion there has centred “on
the kind of obligation which the
United States could undertake,”
since “the power to declare war
rests in Congress and in Congress
alone.” Congress being “jealous
of its rights” in this respect, it’s
as good as certain that “any
agreement would leave with
Congress final authority over the
use of American troops any-
where in the world.”
Further explaining the Ameri-
can viewpoint, the correspondent
added: —
“There is always impatience
here when other countries ask or
expect the United States to do
something which is impossible
for Constitutional reasons, how-
ever reasonable the request might
appear to any other country. But
in this case European anxiety is
understood and every effort will
be made to go as far as possible
to meet it. It is impossible for
the United States to sign any
agreement as binding as the
Brussels Pact, but it will prob-
ably be willing to sign an agree-
ment equivalent to the Western
Hemisphere Defence Pact, which
states that an attack on any of
the contracting Powers shall be
an attack on all, but does not
require any State to use armed
force without its consent.”
Some such compromise seems
the most likely development,
with a pact sufficiently binding to
accord with the stajed aim, which
is not to fight Si war but to
avoid one.
U.S. Aims in Europe.
By Truman appointment,
leading Republican John Foster
Dulles, who would have been
U.S. Secretary of State if Dewey
had become President, leads the
American U.N.O. delegation
whenever < Marshall is absent.
Hence Dulles could' be said to
be speaking for the U.S. in ad-
dressing the American Club in
Paris, where he stated:
“By a gigantic programme
and the renewal of its military
strength, the United States seeks
to maintain the balance of
power in order that Western
Europe, left almost a vacuum of
power by the war, might be
filled by native rather than alien
forces.
“We want Europe to have so
much political strength that
neither the United States nor
any other Power whatsoever
will be able to use it for pur-
poses alien to the free develop-
ment of Europe. We want
Europe to have so much eco-
nomic strength that it will be
prosperous in its own right and
not be dependent on economic
grants from others. We want
Europe to be sufficiently unified
so that, practically, we can work
with it. We want a Europe that
has so much moral and intellec-

FLICKERING FLAME.
tual dynamism that, in the tra-
ditions of the Magna Carta and
the Declaration of the Rights of
Man, it will continue to arouse
men everywhere to strike off
any shackles that curtail their
self-development. We want a
Europe capable of inventing a
new industrial revolution that
will continue to multiply the
productivity of human labor. We
want a Europe which will again
produce literature, music and
art and such religious move-
ments as have in the past in-
spired and enriched the world.”
Significantly, he added that,
while the United States should
develop even closer ties with a
strong, vigorous and contribut-
ing partner in freedom, “we
ought not indefinitely to tie our
fate to the fate of a Western
Europe that insists on retaining
a disunity that invites recurrent
war.” The United Nations, he
said, was not yet a substitute for
regional and collective arrange-
ments. Americans were gener-
ally willing to join one great
effort towards European unity,
and it was for this reason that
they provided Marshall aid and
contemplated joining some At-
lantic pact for collective defence.
It was not to preserve a pre-war
structure that repeatedly had
burst into flames.
Palestine Massacre.
From a statement jointly
issued by leading U.S. Jewish
citizens, among them Albert
Einstein and Professor Sidney
Hook, dealing with the visit to
the U.S. of the Irgun leader
Menachen Begin (the “Freedom
party” referred to has been
formed out of Irgun member-
. ~ . , .
Among the most disturbing
political phenomena of our
tune is the emergence in the
newly-created State of Israel of
e , Freedom party (Tnuat
Haherut), a political party
closely akin in its organisation,
methods, political philosophy
and social appeal to the Nazi
and Fascist parties.. . .From its
past actions we can judge what
it may be expected to do in the
future,
“A shocking example was the
behavior in the Arab village of
Deir Yassin. This village, off
the main roads and surrounded
by Jewish lands, had taken no
part in the war, and had even
fought off Arab bands who
wanted to use the village as their
base.
“On April 9 terrorist bands
attacked this peaceful village,
which was not a military objec-
tive in the fighting, killed most
of its inhabitants—24o men,
women and children—and kept
a few of them alive to para.de as
captives through the streets of
Jerusalem.
“Most of the Jewish com-
munity was horrified at the
deed, and the Jewish Agency
sent a telegram of apology to
King Abdullah of Transjordan.
But the terrorists, far from
being ashamed of their act, were
proud of this massacre, publi-
cised it widely and invited all
the foreign correspondents pre-
sent in the country to view the
heaped corpses and the general
havoc at Deir Yassin.
“The Deir Yassin incident
exemplifies the character and
actions of the Freedom party.”
Youth in Crime.
The Archbishop of York hav-
ing directed attention in the
House of Lords to the stagger-
ing increase in crimes committee!
by juveniles between the ages of
about 16 and 21, the usual
London “Times” correspond-
ence-discussion has followed,
and as usual has brought for-
ward leading authorities in the
particular subject, these among
them advancing some interesting
views.
Blaming the parents has been
one popular easy way out, draw-
ing a joint letter from Alan
Maberly, consultant psychiatrist
to Kent and Essex Child-guid-
ance Services, and John A. F.
Watson, chairman of the South-
East London Juvenile Court.

juvenile crime is to be attributed
wholly to the wilful default of
parents, then it must follow that
parental irresponsibility has in-
creased proportionately, these
writers declared they could see
no evidence to that effect in their
practical experience with this
problem before, during and since •
the war.
“We believe, on the contrary,”
they wrote, “that the evil has
resulted from certain new factors
which during the last 10 years
have so undermined parental
authority as to make an increase
in juvenile delinquency inevi-
table.” After dealing with the
special war-time factors involv-
ing large numbers of children
separated from their parents,
either by bombing or through
parents being on war service, the
writers referred to other factors
that have a very wide application
these days:
“Increasingly in recent years
the State has encroached upon
fields that formerly were the sole
province of the parent: the pro-
vision of food, clothing, shelter
and even bicycles to ride to
school. What is the child to
think of parents whom the State
will not even trust to give him
his milk? If parents cannot be
trusted to care for their
children’s material welfare, why
should they be thought capable
of undertaking their moral edu-
cation?
“Governmental propaganda
lays constant emphasis on
material production and
monetary incentives, without
reference to other values. Scant
respect is paid to private
property, and nationalisation
without fair compensation
carries the inference that owner-
ship is sin. If ownership is sinful,,


it cannot be very wrong to
take.... .Never was there a time
when honesty paid less.
“The remedy is not to be
found merely in the provision of
more clubs and camps. Such
things are a useful adjunct to
home life ; they can never form
a substitute. It is the parents
who need constructive help—
these same parents who have
been advised, lectured, criticised,
censured, ridiculed and prose-
cuted until they have lost their
own .self-confidence and their
children’s respect. And the help
they need, before anything, is
for the status of the family to be
re-established. In short, parent
education is worthless without
full parental responsibility.”
Soviet-zone Forces.
A widely-accepted fegend
about Soviet use of captured
German brasshats to form an
anti-West German army would
seem to have been exploded by
one of the captured, Major-Gen.
Walter Schreiber, .who, in a
press interview, sponsored by the
American occupation authorities,
declared that “Field-Marshal
Von Pa ulus had founded no
army during his captivity.”
The legend of a Von Paulus
army has long been taken for
gospel in American press stories,
with various outsize guesses on
its numbers. General von Seyd-
litz, the other Fritz brasshat
most frequently figuring in the
same legend, also formed no
army, according to General
Schreiber, who declared that the
Free German Committee •to
which both Von Paulus and Von
Seydiitz had belonged had
“purely political aims.”
General Schreiber added,
however, that there was definitely
a Soviet-organised “German
police force” in the Eastern zone
which “represented the first
stage in the development of a
Red Army of Germans,” a
reasonable assumption, since it is
“being given tanks and artil-
lery.”
London “Times,” in editorial
comment, doubts if any Paulus-
Seydlitz army ever existed. It,
however, puts the number of the
so-called “police force” at up to
220.000, compared with a police
force of 40,000 in the British
zone, where the population , is
larger, and “there is good reason
to believe that the Soviet autho-
rities intend to raise the number
to at least 300,000 and possibly
400.000. The “Times” com-
mented: —
“The question inevitably arises
why the Soviet authorities are
intent on creating such a large
and formidable force when at
Yalta and Potsdam the Soviet
—“France-Amerique."
NIGHTMARE OR REALITY?
Government took the lead in
demanding measures to destroy
German militarism for ever. Nor
is it necessary to look far for
an answer. It is plain that such
a force would be extremely use-
ful in maintaining the rule of
the Communist minority in
eastern Germany in the event
of a Russian withdrawal from
her zone; some may see in it
a means of extending the power
of a Communist Government in
the event of a four-Power with-
drawal from Germany.
“It cannot, however, be
assumed from these measures
that the Soviet authorities are
already determined to withdraw.
.... Even if the Soviet Govern-
ment proposes a four-Power
withdrawal from Germany
within 12 months of signing a
peace treaty, as was demanded
in the Warsaw declaration this
summer, it may not prove to be
sincere. The Soviet Government
may think this is one of those
proposals like total disarmament
which are perfectly safe to make
just because they are bound to
be rejected.
“The political significance of
a strong police force is obvious,
but there are other forces at
work in Germany, The Soviet
zone has a population of 20
million, including three million
in Berlin; the Western zones
have a population of 45 million.
The Soviet zone is poverty-
stricken, disorganised and
dispirited; the Western zones,
with the help of Marshall aid,
are making a remarkable re-
covery.”
Also “In the Soviet zone the
Russians have lost much pres-
tige, and a large part of the
German police may even now,
while the Red Army is still there,
be required to prevent demon-
strations against the Communist
minority which rules it. In the
Western zones a large majority
of the people have already
shown they prefer the freedom
of the West. Even if the Rus-
sians could raise a ‘reliable’
police force of 400,000 Germans
in their zone, which is far from
certain, it would not follow that
the Communists would easily
prevail oyer the will pf the Ger-
man people, v
In any case, the “Times” con-
cluded, the only condition on
which the Western Powers
could ever consider a general
withdrawal from Germany
would be the election of a Ger-
man Government, the central
control of all police and the dis-
armament of any para-military
forces. .
Views on Spain.
N. Y. “Times’s” well-informed
chief correspondent in Europe,
C. L. Sulzberger, lately reported
that if U.N.O. takes up the
Spanish question again it ap-
pears certain that “a two-thirds
majority—aided by the Latin-
American countries and the
Arab States—will vote to re-
store full diplomatic relations
and admit Spain to participa-
tion in the United Nations tech-
nical bodies.”
N. Y. “Journal-American’s”
chief correspondent in Europe
sees Soviet Russia seeking to
immobilise Spain both as a Wes-
tern European base of opera-
tions and a§ a possible ally of
America in a Soviet-U.S. war:
“The shortsightedness of
policy on the part of Britain’s
Socialist Labor Government, the
policy of the Left-wing of the
British Socialist party and the
power of Doctrinaire Socialism
raise obstructions to America’s
strategic military defence plans
%ough the aid they indirectly
glve to Soviet Russla and Com '
munism in the efforts to over-

inspired and aided by Com-
munists, Socialists and other
Leftists from without, would im-
mobilise Spain as a powerful or
dependable factor and ally
against Russia and Commun-
ism.”
A ‘!J¥all - street Journal”
foreign - affairs writer reports
that “the wisdom of the effort
to impose a special kind of
ostracism on Spain has become
inofoasingly doubtful.” He
allows that, at a time when the
United States needs close work-
ing co-operation with Britain
and France on the Berlin crisis,
it would probably be unwise to
stir up a bitter controversy by
raising bluntly the issue of re-
scinding the anti-Franco resolu-
tions of U.N.0., “even though
there may be a strong feeling in
American diplomatic circles that
these resolutions failed to
achieve any desirable purpose
and represent a hangover from
an era of futile appeasement of
Moscow.”
It should, however, “be pos-
sible for the United States, with-
out blowing too many trumpets,
to take preliminary strategic
soundings in Spain. It should
also be feasible to favor mea-
sures of economic reconstruc-
tion in Spain which are desir-
able for their own sake and
which may contain an element
of military security.”
The writer expresses a now
fairly widespread American
view in adding, “It would be a
good thing if we could get out
of the habit of regarding
General Franco as either an ex-
ceptional hero or a deep-dyed
villain. We should take him for
what he is, a national dictator
in a long line of Spanish tradi-
tion, and deal with him not on
an emotional or sentimental
basis but on the more solid
foundation of American national
interest.”
Devil's Dictionary.
Samples have already been
printed here of the meanings
given to frequently-used words
in the twisted lexicon of the
Corns. Some additions to their
Devil’s Dictionary are supplied
by a Scripps-Howard staff
writer:
Assassin: A Government
official who instructs the police
to prevent Communist mobs
from occupying public buildings
or seizing Government property.
Blockade: A method of pro-
tecting and defending the people
of a city by depriving them of
food.
Disarmament: Destruction of
the American atom-bomb and
reduction of the Soviet Army to
the point where it is only three
times as large as any other in
the world.
Fascist: Any political leader
who resists Communist control
of the Government.
Independent People’s Repub-
lic : A form of government that
is neither independent, nor of
the people, nor a republic.
Progressive elements; Politi-
cal groups in any country which
follow the dictates of the Krem-
lin.
Imperialist (usually after the
words British-American): Any
person who opposes the further
territorial expansion of Com-
munism.
Militarist: Any American or
British officer who makes plans
for defence of the U.S. or
Britain against attack by a
foreign aggressor.
Warmonger; Any individual,
newspaper or magazine that
discusses or comments favorably
upon those plans.
War-decentralising.
Recommendations to manu-
facturing concerns by the U.S.
National Security Resources
Board, which has the job of co-
ordinating military, industrial
and civilian defence;
Decentralisation should be
seriously considered by industry
in its long-range planning, with
a shift of new plants away from
centres of industry.
Small towns offer the best
opportunity for industries seek-
ing safety in the event of war.
Plants in these areas are least
likely to be the object of bomb-
ing attacks.
Caves, deserts and other
bizarre locations for industry
need not enter calculations of
businessmen. A shift of a few
miles away from strategic areas
is likely to be just as effective.
Even remote locations will not
be wholly immune.
Underground factories are not
recommended. They would be
too expensive, are considered
impractical except for a few
highly strategic plants.

J.B.’s " Spectacular” Recovery. —
The younger Douglas Fairbanks is
evidently a man somewhat above the
average Hollywood pattern: he’s
chairman of Co-operative for Ameri-
can Remittances to Europe and vice-
president of the American U.N.O.
Association. Back from Europe, where
he was presented with a medal ex-
pressing the city of Vienna’s grati-
tude to the Co-operative, he said that
“British resurgence has stumped the
experts,” that “the British are seeing
a new dawn,” and that Britain “is
making the most spectacular recovery
of any European country.”
* * * *
Irish Logic. As interpreted by
Beverley Baxter, M.P., in a London
“Times” letter; “I am surprised at
those of my Parliamentary colleagues
who think that they detect a measure
of inconsistency in the present attitude
of Eire towards the British Common-
wealth. It is really quite clear. In J
stead of Eire saying as in the past,,
‘lnclude me out,’ she now substitutes
‘Exclude me in.’ It is just one more
failure of English romanticism to
grasp the rigid implications of Irish
logic.”
* * * ♦
Medical “Sabotage.” N. Y.
“Herald Tribune” London correspon-
dent, on the workings of Britain’s
Health Service: “There has been
talk of sabotage within the service.
Talk of doctors purposely prescribing
the most expensive and the most rare
medicines. Talk of doctors prescrib-
ing items like fine champagnes and
brandies. It is difficult to obtain
direct evidence of these machinations,
but some doctors friendly to the ser-
vice are certain such sabotage is
going on.”

Losing Indo-China. —Declaring that
“a shooting war, unnoticed by most
of the world, is going on inside the
French empire, pulling it apart,”
“U.S. News and World Report”
states that France is losing and Com-
munist sympathisers winning. It is
costing France $200,000,000 a year,
and as much as $40,000,000 in Mar-
shall Plan supplies will need to be
diverted to that part of the world to
support the French effort. “Almost
all is outgo, with little income 'from
what was once a rich area.”
* * * ♦
Air-lift Invention. —Always able to
produce the exact thing needed, British
inventive genius has come forward
with what is known as “sodium cross-
bar lighting,” being used in operational
conditions for the first time on the
Berlin air-lift. Secretary of State
for Air Henderson has described it
as “a purely British device” by the
aid of which pilots will still be able
to land when visibility “is less than
2000 yards.”

B.C. to Chiang. —Chiang Kai-shek’s
troubles were diagnosed well in ad-
vance with remarkable accuracy; by
his fellow-countryman Sun Tzu, who,
as far back as the sixth century 8.C.,
wrote in his Art of War: “When you
engage in fighting, if victory is long
in coming, weapons will grow dull
and men’s ardor damped. Again, if
the campaign is protracted, the re-
sources of the State will not be equal'
to the strain. Now, when your
weapons are dulled, your ardor
damped, your strength exhausted, and
your treasure spent, other chieftains
will spring up to take advantage of
your extremity. Then no man, how-
ever wise, will be able to avert the
consequences that must ensue.’’

C/o North Pole. —Brief letter to
London “Times”: “Having written
out her requests for Christmas, myi
very small daughter succeeded in post-
ing them. Her letter was addressed:
‘Father Christmas, North Pole, Near
God.’ Instead of the letter being
returned, an encouraging reply was
sent from the North Pole, and she
was delighted. Your readers may like
to know that, in spite of the climate,
the hearts of the postal authorities
remain unfrozen.”
*♦• ♦ *
Britain and Europe. —The charge
that, despite words and appearances
that may seem to the contrary, Britain
is actually an unwilling horse in the
European-Unity team continues to be
made in the U.S. press. Scripps-
Howard foreign editor William Philip
Simms gives this explanation:
“Britain’s principal objection seems
to stem from the Laborites’ unwilling-
ness to participate in any European
federation not composed entirely of
Socialist Governments. The French —
and, oddly enough, the British Tories
—say that attitude is strangely un-
democratic. It smacks of Russian
insistence on Communism as the price
of her collaboration with others.”
* * * *
U.N.O. Boosts. —To other kindly
words for U.N.O. may be added
a few by former U.S. Under-
secretary of State Sumner Welles:
“Can anyone believe that if it
were not for the United Nations
the basic cleavage of which the Berlin
dispute is but a symptom would not
long since have resulted in war rather
than in a debate around the Council
table?”
♦ * * *
Soviet Defences. —Various reports
agree that Soviet war preparations are
going on in the Ukraine and Byelo-
russia but that they could be either
for aggression or in fear of attack.
Both Soviet areas were a month or
! two back placed out of bounds to all
foreign diplomats in Russia, and this,
a “Christian Science Monitor” War-
saw correspondent reports, applies
even to such satellite peoples as the
Poles and Czechs: “It is known in
Warsaw that several members of the
Polish Embassy in Moscow who
wanted to come via the Ukraine by
car to Warsaw for their summer holi-
days were refused permission. This
is taken to show that the Russians
are building fortifications in those
areas, which even the Poles are not
allowed to see.”
♦ * ♦ *
Ruhr Contrbl. —On the French in-
sistence that the Ruhr Authority
should be an effective instrument to
prevent any revival of German mili-
tary power, London “Times” editori-
ally comments: “There is no reason
why it should not be, when backed
by the disarmament and inspection
system envisaged in the other part
of the London agreement. The
French still insist that control of
management as well as of distribution
is essential if the Authority is to be
effective, and their case deserves closer •
study. Even without it, however, no
large-scale rearmament will be pos-
sible without Allied knowledge and,
indeed, Allied approval. What was
lacking in the thirties was not know-
ledge but the will to act.”


THE GIRL AT THE GILDEN GATE
BY RODERICK FINLAYSON.
THE air over the chicken-
house roof is beginning to
dance in the summer morn-
ing sun. Hie black Orping-
tons in the bare, baked yard
move slo.wly and heavily, with
small drowsy duckings, in the
shade of the single blighty haw-
thorn-tree.
Beyond the three unpruned
peach-trees, now bare of fruit, a
woman comes to the door of
the house, dingy with sun-blis-
tered paint, and empties scraps
into a kerosene-tin by the
tumbledown wash-house. The
scrape of the knife on the tin
plate is sharp and shrill. Look-
ing crossly over the yard to a
tin shed the woman takes no
notice of the grizzling of a small
child,
pROM the shed comes the
* clankety-clank of someone
cranking a sulky motor. A few
more clanks and the motor sud-
denly bursts into action with a
frightful roar before it is
throttled down. A clash of
gears, and Bill Judd backs his
old sedan into the yard
and turns her round near the
warped, paintless door of the
packing-shed. It’s the usual
routine every Friday morning
about ten.
He takes out the back seat
and, slouching in and out of the
shed, he carries out crates of
eggs and stows them carefully
in the car.
Bill Judd wouldn’t be more
than thirty-five. His slouch
accentuates his somewhat gang-
ling build and gives a surliness
to his angular face with the pro-
truding blue eyes. He wears a
none-too-clean white shirt frayed
at collar and cuffs, and grey
trousers —his best. He’s without
a coat or hat, and his rough
sandy thatch needs a cut.
\WHEN all the egg-crates are
* * stowed he straightens him-
self a bit and calls, “Flora!
Bring out my things, I’m off
now,”
From the doorstep his wife
grumbles that he needs someone
always waiting on him, but she
brings his grey felt hat and his
blue sports jacket all the same.
She’s probably a year or two
younger than her husband, but
she looks older. She’s worn
thin, with the quick irritable
manner that comes of having to
see to everything.
“Got your wallet and your
driver’s licence? And your
handkerchief? And the money
for the rates? Now don’t for-
get to pay them.”
Bill Judd just grunts yes to
everything. But struggling into
his coat and looking at the laden
car he becomes quite cheery.
“Reckon I save a lot doing
my own carting. Fred Kane
done mb a good turn putting his
charge up a penny a crate. Told
him I’d see him to hell before I
give him any more carting.”
LJ IS wife doesn’t look so hope-
-1 * ful. “You’re qnly getting
through more petrol and
tires,” she says. “And you need
a new shirt. Look at that one.
And what does lunch cost you
in town? I could easily give
you a cut lunch.”
“Not worth your trouble,
dear. I know a sniftyj little
help-your Self joint. Cheap,
cheap as anything. Good
tucker, too.”
“I’ll say! And leave me to
do all the work about the place
while you stay in town drink-
ing till afi hours of the day.”
“Bah! A man’s got to go to
town one day a week on busi-
ness. I got to keep the whole
show paying, haven’t I?”
His wife knows by the pesky
way he rolls and lights his cigar-
ette it will be no use arguing.
She turns on her heel.
Starting the car again without
a word or a wave. Bill Judd
drives through the always-open
gate and settles down to the
fifteen-mile run into town.
Why does she always nag so?
he wonders. She wasn’t like
that once. What a difference a
few years make. Gosh! Eight
years married next month.
COMING into sight of the
haystack in Morgan’s back
paddock he recalls those giddy
days. Flora wasn’t a bad looker
then, eh? She was not more
than eighteen when he met her
at a Labor Day dance. Remem-
ber the way her hair hung sort
of heavy and bright and golden?
The cute way she put on lip-
stick? The way her waist
wobbled when they danced?
She wasn’t a bad kid, eh?
He used to just about live for
week-end dances and visits to
her old man’s place after that.
Those were the days!
Remember the night it hap-
pened, eh? About this time of
the year. Warm summery
nights. Morgan’s haystack was
there right where he always
builds his stacks. There on the
new hay with the moon full and
Flora a regular hot-blooded
youngster tight in his arms —-
gosh!
Well, it was pretty near dawn
when they crept back to her old
man’s place.
“I guess we ought to get mar-
ried now. Bill,” she said ever so
complacently as he kissed her
goodnight again.
And how he agreed! If only
she would marry a poor bloke
like him. If only she would!
They were married a month
later. He still remembers his
vague surprise that their baby
girl wasn’t born until nearly a
year after that. There had
been only one more child, a boy
now five years old.
Well, he reckons he’s been as
happy as you could expect, just
ordinary like, but as happy as
most, he supposes. But gosh!
A chap needs a bit of fun some-
times, eh? Why shouldn’t he?
PjAYDREAMING like this he
t-s nearly collides with a heavy
truck. The driver snarls at him.
0.K., boy, keep your hair on,
he says to himself. After that
the city traffic takes his mind off
fun and fancy until soon he
arrives at the city markets. He
steers in and out between parked
vans and hawkers’ carts and
horses, past doors where the air
is thick and dusty with the smell
of chaff and grain, past pens of
cackling, crowing, quacking
poultry, up to the unloading
platform of the egg department.
He unloads, gets his receipt
from the storeman, picks up his
empties, and then pushes through
knots of Chinese market-garden-
ers and Hindu fruiterers, and
suburban poultry-farmers like
himself, to the office to tell off
the girl about the mistake in last
month’s pay-out. He has to
raise his voice hoarsely and in-
coherently above the gabble of
the auctioneers. The girl coolly
explains that there has been no
mistake. She has a superior air.
She makes him look small.
0.K., baby, 0.K.! he tells
himself as he turns angrily away.
He likes them a bit warm and
human like.
Leaving the markets he parks
the old bus on a section he
knows of, edging her in where it
says on a sign, “Parking »for
Members of the Firm Only,”
HE slouches along a back
street fined with farm-
machinery warehouses. Passing
the second-rate men’s store on
the corner he stops to Took at
the shirts in the window. Those
new in-and-outers look just the
thing. Reckon he should
smarten up a bit. What would
Flora think of him in one of
them? Well, she told him he
needed a new shirt. He goes in.
“Show me some of them in-
and-outers, size four,” he says
to the counter-hopper, giving the
pansy a lookover. Do him good
to have to sweat for his living,
the big suck.
The shop assistant brings out
one with a gaudy floral pattern,
“Now, this is a very smart
design. A quality article, too.
And here is a popular shirt.
Gives that youthful look.”
Bill Judd fumbles them be-
tween his thick blunt fingers.
“And this is the latest for
beach wear. Straight from
Miami.”
It’s a real eye-opener design
of bathing beauties. Bill Judd
thinks it rather daring.
ABIT bright, eh?”
“Oh, dear no, sir. Suits
your coloring perfectly. A bar-
gain, too, at the price.”
Bill Judd says he’ll take it.
And when he adds that he’ll put
it on the assistant shows him
into a cubicle behind a screen.
In a minute or two he walks out
onto the street looking quite a
gay dog. Except for the shaggy
thatch of hair. But he decides
not to have a city haircut as
he’d Ibok too much dolled up.
HALFWAY along the next
block is his favorite cafe-
teria, the Golden Gate. A
narrow grimy passage leads into
a big old room painted a dull
green and jammed full of old
shaky-legged glass-topped tables.
Beside the ancient counter with
its carved scrolls is a new white
refrigerator, and above the
smudgy glass-cases of cakes
and sandwiches a large electric-
fan flicks slowly round. The
only window gives a glimpse of
the tops of tall city buildings
and the cracked brick chimney
of the plumber’s workshop next
door.
Nearly all the . tables are
occupied. The Golden Gate is
a regular haunt of businessmen,
dark-suited and blunt-featured;
with a sprinkling of fair-faced
young clerks; and a few grimy-
handed carriers in shirt-sleeves
and mechanics in overalls hastily
cramming pie into their mouths
and swilling it down with tea.
But you don’t ever see many
women eating there.
Getting a knife and fork and
plate, and picking out beef sand-
wiches and fruit squares. Bill
Judd keeps a look-out for a
place at the far end of the. room
where the waitress called Daisy
serves. He loiters at the shelves
and fidgets about and fumbles
over the food for quite a while in
a very unsettled way.
I OOKJNG around thje kit-
k—chen screen the thin dark
waitress they call Nell says to
big fair Daisy, “Look, there’s
your boy-friend again, Daisy.
Seems to be on the prowl for
you.”
Daisy takes a squizz around
the corner.
“Oh, that hick’s always try-
ing to give me the wink. Bet
you he wants me to go out with
him. He hangs round this place
like a bad smell,”
“Just look at his fancy shirt,
Daisy! ”
“Oh, boy! He’s coming on,
isn’t he?” says Daisy, ducking
back with her tray of dirty
dishes.
At last two men leave one of
Daisy’s tables. Then Bill Judd
hops in before anybody else can
get there.
Her bare feet thrust into old
red slippers Daisy sidles up to
Bill Judd’s table. She pretends
just then to catch sight of him.
“Hullo! You back again?
Want your usual?”
“How did you guess, Daise?
Make it a proper helping like a
good girl. How you doing these
days?”
“All right.” She leans over
to wipe down the table.
Gosh! Daisy certainly is a
ripe young peach, curves and
bloom and all. And most times
she jokes with a feller like a
regular sport. Pity she gets sort
of stuck-up and standoffish
sometimes,
p HAWJNG big mouthfuls of
Vs -" the steak-and-kidney pie that
Daisy brought him, Bill Judd
watches closely, as always, the
middle-aged, thin-haired man in
the trim blue suit who sits at
the comer table. He looks like
something in Big Business —Bill
Judd’s idea of a raffish stock-
exchange gambler. He works up
an intense dislike of the man. He
thinks: There’s the kind of bloke
we sweat and slave to make
fortunes for. Just look at him.
The man beckons airily to
Daisy, who takes little notice of
him on her way past. When she
does come for his order he sings
out quite loudly in his Big Busi-
ness voice, “Daisy, Daisy, how I
do long for you? Well v what’s
nice for your old Uncle Joseph
today, Daisy?”
She looks disdainfully over his
head, not bothering to answer
this sally. She reels off the
usual menu. He’s not the least
disconcerted though. And it’s
this that riles Bill Judd most. In
spite of Daisy’s coolness there
must be something between
them, something secret. Daisy
doesn’t let on to it all, he
guesses.
Look at her now! The saucy
way she brushes past the big
skite when he tries to pat her
on the thigh,
SHE’S off to that old buffer
over there under the dingy
mirror. He’s another that Bill
Judd can’t stand since he has
seen the way the old jink makes
free-and-easy with young Daise.
Old enough to be her father.
Something nasty about that sort.
What can she see in him? Can’t
be money. He looks like no-
thing but a “seagull” off the
waterfront.
And Daisy stands leaning
lightly on the back of his chair
laughing like anything at all he
says. Only, occasionally, they
get serious, lean toward one an-
other, and whisper confidentially.
Gives you a pain in the neck.
And then she preens herself in
the mirror above the old bird’s
head.
Come on over here, Daise,
can’t y’? he says to himself. I
want more tea.
He makes passes in the air to
catch her eye, his neck craned.
She notices his signals at last.
“Won’t be long,” she says to
the old bloke.
As she comes over to him Bill
Judd feels sure she’s eyeing his
bathing beauty in-and-outer.
“Well, what do you want, big
boy?” she says low and husky.
She’s certainly different now.
“What about another cup of
tea, Daise? Make it as sweet
as you, Daise.” He looks her
in the eye as bold as anything.
“My! What a lovely shirt.
Wish I had enough money to
buy a dress like that.”
“Oh, well, you never know,
Daise.”
W HEN Bill Judd has finished
his second cup and is roll-
ing' a cigarette and waiting his
chance to run into Daisy as he
leaves, she comes over to his
table, and as she is wiping up
the crumbs and spilt tea with no
one to overhear she whispers
quickly in an urgent sort of
voice, “I could meet you tonight
after six—if you like.”
He spills some tobacco as he
looks up loose-mouthed. “You
mean it, Daise?”
“After six, tonight,” she says
, meaningly, and hurries away.
With a'spirit of excitement
Bill Judd sets his mind to work
on how best to arrange this.
After six! He’ll have to trump
up some sort of explanation for
not getting home. He’ll say the
car broke down bad. Yes, it’s
Friday—a busy day and a late-
shopping night. He’ll say the
garage people couldn’t do the
job till all hours of the night.
That should give him time.
Feeling like a conspirator and
filled with pleasant expectations
he pays his bill and goes out.
JUST a quarter past two.
How to fill in time till six?
Well, after a snoop round he’ll
go to his favorite pub and relax
and think over his story. He
saunters idly up town, and, see-
ing how things have turned out,
he has a haircut, a real posh
haircut, in a city saloon after all.
What with the long wait for his
turn, it’s well after three before
he lounges into the old Fox
and Fiddle. There are only the
few regulars and one or two
others there, but it’ll liven up
about five o’clock.
A slippery-looking stranger
gets talking to Bill Judd, wanting
him to come along that evening
to a party in a certain joint he
knows about. “Boy, you won’t
regret it,” he keeps repeating.
The stranger’s sly hints excite
Bill Judd, but they annoy him
too, and he’s determined to meet
Daisy. It makes him fair sick to

"LABOR" AND COAL.
Twelve months ago 1948 was hailed by
the Prime Minister as crucial for his
“Golden Age,” and it was all that. In
retrospect its outstanding feature was the
failure of the 40-hour week to produce
either of its promises, contentment in in-
dustry and an increase in man-hour out-
put. Now, according to Mr. Chifley,
1949 will also be crucial —this time for
the “Labor” Government. .
The roots of the 40-hour-week failure
run in many directions —the pandering to
the Communist “class-war” by Socialists
in seats of authority, the shortage of
labor which every militant union official
is exploiting at whim unrebuked by the
Canberra planners, the rising cost of all
goods and services which makes wage-
increases a mockery and blackmarkets a
commonplace, and the deterioration in
morale and in standards of civil responsi-
bility which is the most menacing evil of
all in this aspiring young nation.
All this every intelligent Australian has
seen clearly during the past year. It is
partly a legacy of total war and of its
accompaniment in official propaganda
which went far to kill belief by this
generation in anything at all. But the
war was only partly responsible. The
post-war conditions were propitious for
a degenerated “Labor” party turned
socialist, and its leaders have been hasten-
ing on their revolutionary programme
while those conditions should last. It
is no coincidence that Communist influ-
ence in both industrial and political wings
of the “Labor” party has grown
enormously. Even “Labor” is dismayed,
and “the movement,”
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
Goes to and back, lackeying the varying
tide,
To rot itself with motion.
The Chifley Government has made a
tragic mess of the opportunity offered
Australia after the war ; but in nothing
has its failure been more pronounced
than in Mr. Chifley’s undertaking to put
this country to work. The chant of the
“Labor” party as it went to the 1946
elections was that it was the only party
which could get the unions to put their
weight into the collar. Specifically, it was
the only party which could get coalminers
to produce coal. It was the only party
which had a blueprint for economic
planning. It was the only party which
could avert a depression by controlling
prices. It was the only party, therefore
—so they proclaimed—which the people
could trust.
The Communists sharpened up their
tomahawks and made straight for the
plum-tree as soon as the popular vote
had responded to this blurb as required.
In the first year of his new term Mr.
Chifley yielded to pressure and swallowed
all his expressed convictions by remov-
ing the pegs on wages and maintaining
those on prices of goods produced by
wages. He further inflated working costs
by virtually instructing, through the Gov-
ernment’s counsel, the Federal Arbitra-
tion Court to shorten the working week.
The words in which this was done are
always worth recalling:
The Commonwealth says to the Court,
through me, its spokesman, with con-
sidered words, that after full consideration
of all the material which has been placed
before the Court, the Commonwealth’s view
is that the evidence given warrants the grant-
ing of a 40-hour week.
Since then Mr. Chifley has been alter-
nately appealing to, or exhorting, the
unions, especially the coalminers, to
justify that view by increasing produc-
tion.
The year just past was the first in
which the 40-hour fraud had full sway.
So far from inducing content in industry,
as the less-work fans affected to believe,
it has created nothing but indignant re-
sentment at the unexpected refusal of cost
of living to “stay put,” and to the morti-
fication of the Trades Halls it is begin-
ning to set one union against another.
There are, according to “Labor” theory,
more jobs being laid by in some sort of
cold-storage, but not enough houses to
live in ; more car-owners but less petrol;
more wages but they buy less; more
leisure but less beer.
And the end is not yet, for, above all,
the shortage of coal is prohibiting expan-
sion of industry everywhere in the Com-
monwealth. In each summer of the
Chifley era there has been anxiety about
whether the swollen cities will have
enough coal for the winter, and each
spring the coalfields fall into strikes and
uproar over demands that miners shall
produce sufficient stocks of coal to serve
the country through the miners’ Christmas
break. The Joint Coal Board, which
represents the Socialist Government’s ex-
periment in mine-management, confesses
itself already broken-hearted; and in its
first annual report, after some sob-stuff
about the “bitterness and antagonism be-
tween owners and men derived from [the
industry’s] ruthless history,” it parades its
own disillusionment, “Experience has
forced the board reluctantly to conclude
that the miners’ leaders are unwilling, and
perhaps unable, to control their own
members.” Control over them itself it
has none.
The Coal Board set “a target” this year
of 13,000,000 tons —12 million of it from
underground mining. It got about
11,700,000 tons when the miners went off
on holiday—lo,soo,ooo from underground
mining and 1,200,000 tons from opencut
workings—and it lost over 2,000,000 tons
underground through strikes and
absenteeism. Said Mr. Chifley a few
weeks ago:
Only the expansion of opencut produc-
tion, which at the end of this year will be
at the rate of 2,000,000 tons a year, has
offset the decline in underground produc-
tion and enabled the more urgent needs
of the community to be met.
The multitude of controlling Govern-
ment boards and authorities are not sure
whether a “white” Christmas will not
end in a “black” New Year (through ex-
haustion of „coal stocks) ; but somebody
had to cheer the miners for “Labor”
politics’ sake, and the job fell to “Fixer”
Ashley—the same Minister for Fuel who,
in September, scolded the miners at the
pithead for producing less this year than
under the Menzies Government in 1939,
“although there were 1300 extra men in
the industry and a lot of new machinery.”
He told them then that “a continuance
of coal shortages could mean the end of
‘Labor’ Governments and the end of the
Coal Board.”
But last week he let himself go in
praise of their “magnificent effort” since
the abortive general strike last month, as
though he were watching a tenth-wicket
stand in a losing Test match. “It must
have been a heavy strain on them,” he
said, “to make up the leeway,” and went
on to ask, in effect, why they didn’t get
going before? The answer, firstly, is that
the miners are taking longer holidays
and therefore want more spending-
money just now; and, secondly, that
ordinarily they won’t exteed a set “darg”
for the benefit of either the community’s
coal stocks or Mr. Chifley’s tax-collector.
But the first year of the Government’s
four-year plan has ticked over and
the Coal Board’s “target” for 1949 and
ensuing years rises progressively to 18
million tons by 1952. The pathetic truth
is that industry is already demanding that
18 million tons now if it is to be freed
from restrictions imposed by shortages,
and it could have them with ease if the
miners would work a second shift or if
the N.S.W. Minister for Mines would
permit the mechanical extraction of pil-
lar coal, which he refuses because the
miners won’t stand for it.
If 1949 does not see some changes,
among which Messrs. Chifley and “Fixer”
Ashley fear “the end of ‘Labor’ Govern-
ments,” the “mimicking Molotovs” who
run the coalfields will have put Australian
industry well into the discard.”
Dangerous Meddling.
Only a few days after the Australian,
Philippines, Russian and Indian delegates
had secured the admission of the so-
called Indonesian Republic as an asso-
ciate member of E.C.A.F.E. there seemed
to be little left of the realm of Jogjakarta.
About the time of the E.C.A.F.E.
episode Mr. Chifley made a statement in
Parliament on Indonesian affairs. He said
that everybody would like to see the
Netherlands and the Indonesians compose
their differences. He related that recently
the Netherlands Foreign Minister had
flown to Jogjakarta to confer with the Re-
publican Premier and other officials “in a
further effort to reach a basis for agree-
ment on the future position of the Re-
public.” He added:
As I pointed out to the House a short
time ago, the Indonesian discussions are
at a delicate stage where comment from
outside parties might not be helpful. I
do not therefore wish to go into more
detail on this subject at the present time.
I have only to say this, that when the time
comes to make known all the facts from
the beginning of this episode Australia’s
considered policies and actions will receive
widespread approbation.
Though the discussions were at a “too
delicate stage” for public comment,
the position was not too delicate to
allow the blundering Australian Govern-
ment, whose delegate always seems to be
available whenever there is a chance for
a busybody to interfere with somebody
else’s domestic affairs, to become the
sponsor of an action which was bound
to throw out of gear jvhatever arrange-
ments were in process of being framed
in the discussions between the Nether-
lands Government and the Indonesians.
The very fact that the Indonesians at
that point were prepared to apply for
admission to E.C.A.F.E. showed a
shocking lack of tact on their part, and
the brigading of Australian votes with
those of Communists and unstable
Asiatic States which cannot govern except
by armed force or by reason of some-
body else’s power to keep their peoples
in order was scarcely calculated to do
anything save make the Indonesians feel
that the justice of their demands in
general was acknowledged and that they
would have support if they pushed
matters to extremes.
It was also certain that if the applica-
tion for admission were granted our
formerly friendly allies, the Netherlands,
would leave the conference. But this did
not deter the blunderers of Canberra and
their Asiatic and Communist friends
from going ahead with their plans. And
now they are in the forefront of the rush
to demand that the Security Council of
U.N.0., which has no more power in its
bones than any other twitching corpse,
shall knock the combatants’ heads to-
gether and mend the mischief which they
themselves did so much to produce and
which they are intensifying by the use of
language so violent that it lays them
open to the strong suspicion that they
are partisan, and opposed to the Dutch,
who have now been “ordered” by the
Security Council to cease fire.
Colonel Hodgson, Australia’s repre-
sentative on the Security Council,
characterised the Dutch attack on Jog-
jakarta, with “only \l\ hours’ warning,”
as something “worse than Hitler did to
the Netherlands in 1940.” He added
plaintively: “It affects my country. It
causes strikes, strife and turmoil.” If
the A.A.P. report may be believed, he
“frequently rapped the table and waved
his arms, once or twice barely missing the
Netherlands delegate, who sat next to
him.” And he told the Security Council
that the Netherlands should be expelled
from U.N.O. if it did not cease its attacks
on the Indonesian “Government” —which
is not yet fully recognised even by U.N.O.
as a Government.
It is novel to hear of anybody
connected with the present Aus-
tralian “Government” who can be-
come hysterical over strikes or turmoil.
But that will be forgotten in the realisa-
tion that the outburst was in the interest
of a so-called Republic most of whose
leaders collaborated with the Japanese
during a period in which, according to
one of their emissaries in Australia,
4,000,000 Indonesians were sent to
Japanese slave-camps or killed or tor-
tured,
It was made in the cause, too, of a
“Government” whose late Premier has
been murdered, apparently by his former
friends, while involved in a Communist
rebellion. It was on the behalf, also,
of a “Government” whose same Premier
last year was receiving the full support
of U.N.O. on the ground that his was a
patriotic Indonesian movement represen-
tative of the people, whereas he, as he
later admitted, had been a clandestine
Communist since 1935, therefore owing
allegiance not to Indonesia but to Mos-
cow.
The Netherlanders have been very
patient with U.N.O. in the matter of In-
donesia and equally patient with the In-
donesians, They have sought no more
from the so-called Government of Jog-
jakarta than that it should demonstrate
its ability to govern and join in a federa-
tion of Indonesian Powers on terms
generally acceptable. The Republican
Administration has, however, shown it-
self unstable, ever-changing in its per-
sonnel and fickle in its loyalties. Its real
intentions have obviously not always been
its proclaimed ones. It has played with
Communism and courted the help of
Moscow, as its leaders courted the sup-
port of Japan during the years of the
occupation. It has claimed a public sup-
port which it has obviously never pos-
sessed and a grip on administration
which repeated murder, atrocity and
banditry has shown not to exist. It has
been false to agreements and treacherous
in negotiation. And it has collapsed like
a pack of cards at the first blow by the
Netherlands, which obviously could not
have achieved so complete a conquest of
it if it had had a tenth of the strength
and authority which it professed to have.
It has little claim to the sympathy of
civilised peoples, and certainly none to
that of Australians.
Australian interference does not add
either to the stature of the Government
or to the safety of this country. The
world is in such a chaotic state
that the Western European nations have
felt it necessary to band themselves into
a military alliance for self-protection.
They feel the imminence of events so
forcibly that they have even established a
military headquarters under the com-
mand of Britain’s foremost soldier. Yet
at the moment when this is going on,
when it needs only a spark to make V£ar
burst into flame, the Australian Govern-
ment is acting in concert with our
potential enemy and antagonising one of
our most valued allies in the Western
bloc, a country which was loyal to us
while under enemy occupation and which
has been wholeheartedly loyal since its
rescue by the British and Canadian
forces*
It might well be asked where the
Opposition is at this juncture. Mr. W.
M. Hughes has been prompt with his
opinion:
Indonesia for the Indonesians means
Indonesia for the Communists, who, when
they succeed in encircling the world, will
use Indonesia as a strategic base against
Australia. The Dutch have as much right
to be in Indonesia as we have to be in
Australia.
Our “Government,” Colonel Hodgson,
and the Opposition, in assessing the situa-
tion, should compare the Netherlands
Indies position with what has happened
to Eastern Europe under Russia in spite
of U.N.O. This comparison would not
be in any way odious to the Dutch.
Mr. Ward and Mr. Chifley.
The acquittal of J. S, (“Jock”) Garden
(already in jail on a forgery conviction),
Harcourt Garden and Raymond Parer in
the New Guinea timber-lease conspiracy
case has been followed by Mr. Ward’s
request for a Royal Commission into
certain matters relating to the case, and
his handing-in of his portfolio of External
Territories. He could do nothing less,
though he could have done a lot more,
and that a lot sooner. That Mr. Ward,
as stated last week by Mr. Chifley, had
made “a similar request a year ago at
the very outset of the case and has pressed
it ever since” is difficult to reconcile with
statements made and questions answered
by both Mr. Chifley and Mr. Ward, the
Prime Minister on one celebrated occa-
sion stating, in this regard, that he re-
fused to accept the word of a “convicted
criminal” or a “larrikin lawyer,” and Mr.
Ward having said on May 16 that a
report that he would ask for a Royal
Commission into his administration was
“fantastic.”
The charges against the accused and
one other (Farrell) were made a year ago,
and during most of that time Mr.
E. J. Ward, Minister for External Terri-
tories, has been laboring under an accusa-
tion made by his formerly close friend,
“Jock” Garden, that he had been in-
volved in the commission of one of the
worst offences which can be established
against a Minister of the Crown —the
taking of a bribe.
Mr. Ward has denied the charge in rude
Doric phrases. And the verdict of the
jury in the timber-lease conspiracy case
is no judgment upon him. The Judge
made it clear that “though Mr. Ward is
an important witness, relied on by the
Crown, he is not on trial.”
But even ignoring Garden’s allegation
(and Ward’s denial) that Ward was “in
for his cut” in the timber-lease transac-
tion and that Harcourt Garden was his
dummy in the deal, there are other
matters which require explanation, and
which should become the subject of
inquiry.
One is the relationship of Mr. Ward
with Mr. Urquhart, his personal friend
and political henchman, whose promotion
in the Manpower Department wa's re-
markably swift, and for whom Mr. Ward
obtained a lucrative position in a busi-
ness which received a typewriter-import
licence on an application addressed to Mr.
Ward, not to the Customs Minister.
Mr. Ward and Mr. Urquhart should
also welcome an inquiry into Mr.
Urquhart’s conduct of the Newtown
Manpower office and his betting and
banking transactions in view of the ques-
tions asked in court.
This is all the more necessary because
of the extremely intimate personal con-
nection existing between Mr. Ward and
Mr. Urquhart, as disclosed in the evi-
dence at the trial of Garden in May:
Mr. Isaacs: As for your visits to Mr.
Ward’s house?—l went there on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays on electoral work
—interviewing his constituents.
Did you always get a Government car?
—A private hire-car.
Hired through the Government agency?
—That is right.
Judge Stacy: The Government paid for
the car to take you there? —Yes.
Surely this proceeding needs thorough
review, as do allegations that “certain
barmaids were not called up” for Man-
power purposes, because of instructions
from “head-office”; also, the peculiar
arrangements in respect of which Judge
Stacy questioned Mr. L. E. Balmer,
“assistant private-secretary to Mr. Ward
for six years and a half,” who admitted
signing Mr. Ward’s name to a lettei
addressed to “Dear Jock” without Mr.
Ward’s authority.
And there is the burning question as
to why Mr. Garden was employed at all.
He was a notorious character —a founder
of the Communist party; he had printed


the most nauseating libels on the Royal
family; and he had on occasions urged
lawlessness and insurrection. But his
Communist beliefs had not prevented his
becoming well-to-do.
Yet Mr. Ward had chosen this fellow to
be his Man Friday—his “liaison-officer.”
He had provided him with an office
opposite his own on the Parliamentary
floor of the Commonwealth Bank in
Sydney, where, though not a Minister or
member, he had his name on a door.
This was during the period when Man-
power regulations were in flower, yet it
was never made clear what his duties
were. Even questions in Parliament to
the Prime Minister failed to reveal them.
After Mr. Ward was transferred from
the Labor and Industry Department, Mr.
Garden was retained in his post by his
old associate of the A.C.T.U,, Mr. E. J.
Holloway. Yet he was not removed
to Mr. Holloway’s department. He con-
tinued to be housed opposite to Mr.
Ward, whose political campaign-director
in East Sydney he was, and continued to
collect his mail from Mr. Ward’s office,
of which he appears to have had the run.
Mr. Ward himself when in Opposition
assumed the role of sedulous watchdog of
the Menzies Government’s morals —he
was strident in his insistence that when
Mr. Lawson, Minister for Trade ’and
Customs, leased a racehorse from
Mr, W. J. Smith, who was involved
in negotiations with the Govern-
ment for the manufacture of an Aus-
tralian motor-car, a Royal Commission
was “imperative.” It should therefore
follow that he will insist that whatever
tribunal is appointed in the present
instance it shall have powers to deal with
all the doubts raised by the two trials,
and any other relevant matters as well.
There is a further feature of the whole
amazing story which calls for serious in-
vestigation, and that is the attitude of the
Prime Minister. When the matter of an
inquiry was raised at a press conference
in May, Mr. Chifley was reported to have
said that he had
watched the administration of Government
departments pretty closely. All Ministers
consulted him on administration. “I do
not believe the charges against Mr. Ward
and never have. I have complete faith in
Mr. Ward’s honesty.”
This was uttered after Judge Stacy, in
his summing-up in the Garden forgery
trial, had said that “the history of the
case started in 1944, and this gigantic
fraud was not shown up until December,
1947. One cannot help wondering how
it could last so long. There were rumors
at an earlier stage.”
By his statement Mr. Chifley has, in
effect, taken personal responsibility for
Mr. Ward’s good behavior and efficient
administration. He owes it to his own
standing as Prime Minister to show what
steps he himself took, when the informa-
tion was brought to his notice, in order to
satisfy himself about Mr. Ward’s adminis-
tration. If Mr. Chifley is “satisfied” with
the way Mr. Ward’s department has been
conducted, then it is high time an inde-
pendent judicial opinion was obtained,
regardless of time involved or cost
incurred.
PLAIN ENGLISH
Victorian Unions' Split.
To the accompaniment of the yells of
trade-union civil war in Melbourne, Mr.
Chifley has issued “a Christmas message
to the ‘Labor’ movement,” saying that “it
will be necessary to stand firmly together,
to keep our ranks solid and to work un-
ceasingly for the return [in election yearj
of the ‘Labor’ Government.” For “the
movement,” he adds, “1949 will be
crucial.” So it will.
Simultaneously in Melbourne the con-
test between the Communist-bossed union
executives and the A.L.P. section of the
Trades Hall has come to an open clash
with the issue of High Court writs by
the Communists seeking an injunction
against the Trades Hall Council to re-
strain the Council from suspending their
delegates. The discussion, smouldering
since the Reds were outvoted at the Vic-
torian A.L.P. conference last Easter, burst
into flame last month when the Trades
Hall negotiated with the Hollway Gov-
ernment to call off the general strike,
provided prosecutions under the Essen-
tial Services Act were abandoned. The
Communist plan to blockade Victoria
was thus thwarted, and the Reds who run
the local branches of the railway, sea-
men’s, ironworkers’, painters’, builders’
and meat unions—all spoiling for a strike
on political grounds—promptly charged
the Melbourne Trades Hall and the
A.C.T.U. with selling out to the Hollway
Government.
The T.H.C. demanded that the unions
concerned should repudiate statements of
this sort published in their “Trade Union
News,” and for a series of fortnightly
XH. meetings the Communists have
attended in force, aiming, by blocking
business of the meetings, to prevent reso-
lutions of that sort from being con-
sidered. The T.H.C. defeated these
manoeuvres by calling a special meeting
for the purpose and suspending the Red
delegates and the organisations they re-
present.
The row will now be transferred to the
High Court. According to the spokes-
man for the seamen —the body which was
to conduct the blockade of Victoria —it
will be “boots and all.” Of course,
in Russia these strikemongers would
simply be grabbed and shot in the back
of the neck without having available any
process of law-least of all as plaintiffs.
No Country Houses.
G. V. Lawrence, secretary of the Murray
Valley Development League, having
browsed through a publication called
“Australian Housing Statistics” issued by
the Directorate of Housing of the Com-
monwealth Department of Works and
Housing, and “Building Statistics,
1945-48,” put out by the Bureau of
Statistics and Economics, Sydney, dis-
covered that in housing, as well as in
other matters, centralisation is still the
prevailing disease of Governments, and
that only in private building is the country
getting any sort of a fair go.
Remarking that the 1947 census showed
that Sydney had 49 p.c. of the N.S.W.
population and Melbourne 58 p.c. of that
of Victoria, Mr. Lawrence notes that in
N.S.W. from the beginning of the Com-
monwealth-State Housing Agreement to
OLD STORY, NEW SETTING.
March this year, 80 p.c. of the dwellings,
erected were in the County of Cumber-
land, and that of the remaining 20 p.c.
more than half would be in Newcastle
and Wollongong, both practically outer
suburbs of Sydney. It was slightly better
in Victoria, the respective percentages
being 70 and 30. The percentages are no
improvement, for the country, in figures
issued since March, though again the
rural Victorians in need of houses did
slightly better than those across the
Murray.
It is, of coutse, cold comfort for
country taxpayers, plenty of them house-
less or living in tumbledown shacks, to
realise that these Government housing
schemes are financed from their taxes as
well as from city taxes ; but so long as
Murray Valley or New England people
are content to do nothing more than
growl, so long will the big city draw unto
itself both population and money from
the country. There is no apparent solu-
tion short of the creation of new States,
Meantime it may—or it may not—
-solace Mr. Lawrence to know that if all
the Government publications about hous-
ing were pasted together, cut into shape

prefabs to house half Albury; the other

partment of Works and Housing and
other Government offices scattered
through the bigger country towns.
A River Highway.
“K.”: For the first time probably since
Captain Francis Cadell took the Lady
Augusta from Sydney around to the
Murray mouth and with her opened
navigation of the Murray —and that is
nearly a century ago—coal is being
burned in the furnaces of a lower-
Murray steamer.
It is announced that the steamer Ren-
mark, plying in the down-river traffic, is
burning coal—Leigh Creek coal.
There is more than one portent in this
hews. Firewood, the one and only fuel
they have used all these years, must be
fetched from greater distances, and labor
costs are, no doubt, sending up the price.
Again, Leigh Creek is coming into pro-
duction, and the South Australians are
straining every effort to be rid of de-
pendence upon the Communist-bossed
N.S.W. coal industry. Lastly, the Murray
carrying trade, freight and tourist traffic,
is reviving, and every extra shilling
added to rail freights under the 40-hour
week and basic-wage increases plays into
the hands of those who keep open the
cheaper freight-line of the river-road.
It was said 50 years ago, and is still
true, that no people in the world, blessed
with the gift from Nature of a river high-
way into the heart of their country’s
producing regions, would have so
neglected it as Australians have neglected
the potential value of the Mtirray. The
city interests of Melbourne and Adelaide
are, of course, responsible for that
foolishness, and it is a familiar story. The
old river will beat them yet.
The Japanese Hangings.
“Yellow Sea” looks into the future
Australian press correspondents in Japan
report of the hanging of six generals and one
civilian, ex-Foreign Minister Hirota, that they
went to the gallows calm and unemotional. The
details of the last hours of General Tojo would
make it seem that he was, as we would say,
repentant. Among the people “the reaction
appeared stoical and indifferent,” we are told,
and the Emperor “was apparently the least
moved” of all this unmoved race, our recent
enemies.
Is this a safe impression for Australians to
take away from an event whose influence on
the future is not yet to be foreseen? The most
famous Ifegend in Japan is that of the 47 ronin
(servants) of a feudal lord, whose story has
for centuries infused into the Japanese mind the
propriety of self-sacrifice in the cause of per-
sonal and national loyalty. The seven high
officers of the Japanese war-time State, made
sacrifices to a lost war, may well have gone
calmly to their deaths accepting their fate
eithe as arising from their having failed to carry
their nation through to victory, or as atone-
ment to the victors for sake of that nation’s
recovery.
But in either case they may easily become
national heroes, and the Emperor’s party on
the morrow of their execution may have been
only nominally in honor of the Crown Prince’s
15th birthday.
We shall not understand these people while
we look at them through only Western—let
alone Australian—glasses. This generation, at
this time, is not prepared to hear many things
that will be said later when history affords a
perspective of this past dc ade.
Death on the Roads.
“C.S.”: The continuous road-accident
toll suggests that speed and other safety
laws are being disobeyed, and all the
propaganda put out by Road Safety
Councils and allied bodies doesn’t achieve
its object. That by no means signifies that
safety propaganda is wasted; it isn’t.
But it does suggest that the problem needs
a lot more study and some new ideas.
If Governments are concerned with
saving human life —as Governments of
an underpopulated country should be —
they could make a good beginning by
asking themselves where the speed craze
is heading. Why, for instance, should any
motor-car used by a private individual
for non-business purposes be capable of
hitting 60 to 70 m.p.h. at the touch of a
toe? And, in business, is it necessary

CARRERAS LIMItED ■ OVER 150 YEARS REPUTATION FOR QUALITY]
to increase manufacturing output by a
quarter in the five years from 1947 to a
level about 40 per cent, above 1938.
This expanding output will make pos-
sible an estimated expansion of exports by
nearly two-fifths above the level achieved
in 1947, and this, in turn, will support a
considerable increase in raw-material im-
ports. At the same time the supply in
capital equipment to home industry should
increase to a level about 15 per cent, above
1947.
Britain, left to its natural energy and
genius, has always managed to “deliver
the goods” in the past. The aim of
achieving a credit balance in overseas
trade by 1953 is entirely commendable.
But the Socialists have disrupted British
industry internally, often to satisfy
nothing more than trade-union prejudices.
“Another four years of toil, sweat and
luck.” Ay, lots and lots of luck —and
lots of co-operation from the private
enterprise despised by Socialists.
POLITICAL POINTS
In a Christmas message to his sup-
porters, in which he appealed for
solidarity and support at the next Federal
election, Chifley said, “I know that the
Federal Parliamentary ‘Labor’ party can
look with confidence for that support,
and so I am certain that 1949 will be a
happy New Year for the ‘Labor’ move-
ment.” So far so good, but even the
happiest of Happy New Years have a
persistent habit of finishing up as drab
and disappointing Old Years, and “Labor”
has to face the electors not while 1949
is still in the first flush of bright and
optimistic youth, but when it is tottering
towards crabbed and decrepit Old Age.
With four working days left before the
N. S. Wales coalmines cldsed down for
the Christmas break, which lasts until
January is wellnigh spent, “Fixer” Ashley
announced that “the community was now
guaranteed Christmas holidays without
inconvenience through lack of coal.”
Almost before he had finished saying it
South Australia’s Premier Playford was
pointing out that unless another large
collier could be allotted immediately his
community would be on the rocks for
coal. A day later the chairman of the
Sydney County Council said that although
“Sydney” would have “a white Christ-
mas” the prospects for next winter were
bleak indeed. “The power position,” he
prophesied, “would be the worst in
Sydney’s history.” The miners’ began
their holidays on December 23. A
normal day’s work on Christmas Eve
would have raised, enough coal to keep
Bunnerong going for close on three weeks
or to fill 10 inter-State colliers.
The prize for the most unconsciously
humorous Christmas card must this year
be awarded to the Honorable Arthur
A. Calwell, M.H.R. His entry is illus-
trated with a picture of two Balt girls,
entitled: “We found a home.” The two
immigrant young ladies are shown ap-
parently camped under a gum-tree and
the only furniture in sight is one chair
between them.
Sydney police have warned the public
against an unsigned pamphlet advertising
a “Cosmic Force Box” which, it is
claimed, will among other things
hasten plant growth, prevent soil-erosion,
turn deserts into habitable areas, cheapen
power, light and heat, eliminate poverty,
make unsettled minds healthy and satisfied,
provide better bousing, recreational and
educational facilities and eliminate civil
disturbances and war.
The dimensions are said to be 3ft. by
3ft. by 16in, —rather too big for a safe-
deposit box and a little too small for a
travelling-trunk, but for all that it sounds
very like the Socialist plan for a Golden
Age.
Caucus will have to speak severely to
Bert Evatt. Talking of U.N.O. he said,
“People say the debates are too long.
I can’t understand this. That is the
essence of the democratic system.” For-
ward Mr, Scully, Minister for the Gag.
Thousands of Australian Boy Scouts
went into camp on the Yarra above Mel-
bourne this week, in company with
hundreds of others from neighboring
countries, in a Pan-Pacific jamboree. The
Prime Minister ought to find time to hold
a review of the Australian boys—they To
the only defence force we’ve got. He
might even locate a battalion of them
to go and spank the Dutch —if the
Wharfies’ Union will let them.
Addressing the tribunal at the Board
of Trade inquiry, Sir Hartley Shawcross
remarked that “in no other country
would the Government have insisted on
an inquiry so far-reaching.” It may have
been a rather sweeping statement, but
the Australian Government for one is
hardly in the position to protest against
the all-in impeachment. The Keane
trunks affair, from labels to key-chains,
simply shrieked for the fullest possible
investigation, but the Ghifley Govern-
ment has repeatedly refused a Royal
Commission and has not been moved
from its decision either by a desire to
allay public suspicion nor the more
human motive of clearing the name of
a dead colleague.
“Silent Night” would have been the
fitting Christmas song for the Queensland
Agrarians and the Kewpies. All was
quiet and peaceful between them last
week, with C.P. leader Campbell promis-
ing to stand to the death, in Federal
Moreton —or what’s left or it—behind
Josh Francis, the Liberal, who a lot of
Agrarians thought might be after the
new McPherson seat, which Fadden
wants. Anyhow, a soft spirit prevails and
the boys are expected to “co-operate in
most' electorates at the Federal elections.”
Nejy Yofk Zionists held an “Action
for Israel” rally to celebrate the first
anniversary of the U.N.O, decision on
Palestine, A display advertisement in
New York “Post” listed the attractions —
several speakers, including “Dr. Stephen
Wise, president of the American and
World Jewish Congress, Oscar Ewing,
Federal Security Administrator, and I. F.
Stone, Journalist and Author.” “Pales-
tinian Songs,” by Ingrid Rypinski, were
promised, and as a further inducement to
the faithful to toll up in large numbers
the notice concluded “Admission Free.
No solicitation of Funds.” If that didn’t
bring ’em along then the cause of Israel
is lost.
On the day that N.S.W. Actors’
Equity suffered a sea-change and banned
Communists (persons carrying on sub-
versive activities) from membership, the
Communist section of the N.S.W.
Teachers’ Federation held what is called
“the annual conference of the Federa-
tion” and “condemned” the Teachers’
Anti-Communist League, which has the
Communists squealing from Tenterfield
to the Murray. Comrade Lewis, the
Federation president, hotly denied having
inveigled a teacher to Marx House, loudly
declaring that he’d never been there in his
life. Next day he mumbled about having
his dates mixed or being misreported or
something. The teachers ought to study
the actors’ copy-book.
Some opinions of U.N.0.:
Sir Hartley Shawcross: I will not be a
party to deceiving the public by pretending
that, in its main function of acting as a
centre for harmonising differences, U.N.O.
is a going concern or one in which useful
business is being transacted Debates have
increased, not diminished, the tension be-
tween East and West.
Duff CoOper: If it is too much to de-
mand riddance of this expensive, useless
and dangerous luxury, might we not sug-
gest that it should be put into temporary
cold-storage? It has certainly exercised
a malign influence on foreign relations.
Canadian External Affairs Minister Pear-
son: Exhausting, frustrating and de-
pressing. Most depressing feature was that
every single object, no matter how innocu-
ous or how unimportant, was interpreted
in the light of the struggle between East
and West.
Our Doctor Evatt; At a time when there
is a danger of war U.N.O. is the place to
which the disagreements and conflicts of
the world should be brought The tension
between the Great Powers, so marked in
September, has eased as a result of the
Assembly’s work Far from feeling frus-
trated, I feel better about it.
If U.N.O. has enabled the Doctor to get
rid of some of his frustrations it has
achieved something, but the world ex-
pected more of it than that.
Just as a sort of Christmas reminder
the Sydney Water Board and the Milk
Board informed the city that both liquids
were short. It had to be something.
As the coalminers went off on their
Christmas holidays, their Communist
bosses gave notice to the Chifley and
McGirr Governments that “if they ex-
pect the same contribution [as this year]
from the mineworker in 1949”
10,500,000 tons of coal mined ; 2,000,000
tons lost by stoppages —they (the Govern-
ments) must yield what the miners de-
mahd. What the miners’ bosses de-
manded after their recent convention
would bankrupt the country. As sum-
marised by the executive just before
Christmas these were:
All the promised amenities to brighten
coalfield towns.
Long-service leave.
Increase in miners’ pensions (their own
pension fund is bankrupt).
A shorter working week.
General “improvement” in “standards” in
the industry.
This is described as “a fair deal in re-
turn for the miners’ contributions to the
well-being of the Australian people.”
Chifley’s view last October of the miners’
“contribution to the country’s well-being”
was that they had kept coal output so
low that only the yield from opencut
workings had enabled “the more urgent
needs of the community” to be met.
From The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabit-
ant: —•
Memories were stirred by Jock Garden’s
statement on oath that he had tendered £5OOO
in £lO-notes to E. J. Ward, through another
(deqied on oath try Ward), as Ward’s share
of land-transaction loot. The mists of 43 years
rolled away, and I found myself recalling Peter
Close’s evidence at the Sydney 1905 land-
scandals inquiry concerning his pressing a
parcel containing a selected portion of the
root of all evil on the then N.S.W. Minister
of Lands, W. P. Crick. And, of course, I
had to turn up The Bulletin’s account of
Close’s revelation —written, as I remember, by
James Edmond —the salient features of which
are here reprinted:
“The scene at N.S.W. Lands Commission
when Peter Close confessed his master
was dingily impressive. There was none
of the usual adornment of the legal tragedy-
no coat of arms, no judicial throne, no wig
of horsehair, no uniformed tipstaffs, criers
nor police; just a dusty room with a statuette
of some forgotten celebrity in an advanced
state of grime, a table or two. a Judge look-
ing stern and sorry in his ordinary everyday
habiliments, and a big handsome witness seated
uneasily in a chair making statements, which,
if true, blighted for ever his own character and
that of W. P. Crick, ex-Minister for Lands. A
Court of Justice showed that it could be awful
without the frippery that is defended on the
ground of the necessity to impress the vulgar,
for when the reluctant witness first mumbled
‘Mr. Crick,’ a cold stillness, eloquent of
much, settled on the dusty little room, with
its small group of listeners. Mr. Close was
asked as to the fate of a certain fee he had
received. Half, he said, he had devoted to his
own use. ‘And the other half?’ asked Mr.
Pilcher suavely. ‘‘You put me in a most painful
position,’ objected the witness. ‘And the other
half?’ asked Mr. Pilcher. ‘That went to the
Minister.’ ‘To whom?’ ‘To the Minister,
Mr. Crick.’ Thus the Lands Inquiry entered
on its final stage.”
Army Minister Chambers has expressed
his regret that he was not able to be
with his beloved but depleted soldiery in
Japan for the Christmas season —he has
to take over Mr. Ward’s duties while his
colleague is assuring that “truth and
right win in the end.” Mr. Chambers’s
grief is no doubt sincere, since Christmas
in a democratic land where even privates
have Jap servants to clean their
boots and wash their linen, and million-
aire resorts like Kawana hotel are buck-
shee for Ministers, can be very pleasant.
The grief of the deprived soldiery will
probably be made manifest in a burst of
cheering which will shake down the top
layer of snow off Fujiyama. Mr.
Chambers’s last visit to Japan was scarcely
a success.
Senatpr McKenna may be solacing
‘“Labor’s” injured prestige by declaring
war on the 8.M.A., but he is not for-
warding the interests of the national
health scheme. That, as he admitted in
the past, “cannot be implemented without
the co-operation of the doctors.” Does
he also mean to declare war on the
nurses, whose association has by special
resolution refused to be diagnosed under
McKenna’s legislation?
Premier McGirr, captured on board the
Strathaird at Perth on his way back to
Sydney, burbled joyfully about “British
industrialists having a wonderful oppor-
tunity to transfer their weaving and
spinning plants and staff to Australia”
to be “close to their wool supplies.” The
trouble is that most of them are too
scared of getting close to Premier Mc-
Girr.
Maffra Shire Council (Vic.) is now
wishing it had bought a new steamroller.
It sent the old one off for repairs, got a
bill for £1470, held the repairer wasn’t
authorised to exceed £3OO because a
Council resolution said so, and refused
to pay. A Supreme Court Judge found
for the Council, but on appeal the High
Court ruled otherwise, and now the
Council is up for the £1470, plus costs
running into about £3500. There were
nearly enough counsel to roll the sugar-
beet town flat.
Dr. Evatt, speaking over 8.8. C. on
October 21: “You measure the success
of the Assembly not at the beginning,
but at the end.” Right, it’s over. The
Berlin deadlock is as far off solution as
ever; the Palestine trouble still defies
peacemakers; Indonesia is a battle-
ground. Successes? —A couple of plati-
tudinous resolutions on human rights and
genocide.
Colonel Hodgson, Australian delegate
to U.N.0., in a “violently worded de-
nunciation of the Dutch” over the Indo-
nesian affair, got this off:
It affects my country. It causes strikes,
strife and turmoil. It causes the loss of
material necessary for world rehabilitation,
loss of commerce’, and the growth of ex-
tremist ideas. The repercussions may well
cayse a big breach in international peace.
Therefore we arc bound to take action.
“Bound to take action.” Against whom?
The local instigators of “strikes, strife and
turmoil”? Not on your life. The
speaker represents not Australian senti-
ment but a Government whose foreign
policy is dictated by a Communist-run
wharflumpers’ union and which cowers
every time any “militant” scowls at it.
But this is the first official admission that
policy is determined by, the wharfies.
Who says the Japs aren’t rapidly adopt-
ing Western ways? Sazure Shikuma,
Democratic M.P., challenged Jiro Arita.
Demoliberal M.P., to a duel. It had to
do with the biting of a lady member s
neck in the Diet. Arita replied in what
he termed “a democratic manner.” He
summonsed the challenger for threaten-
ing him with violence.
Victoria is dabbling with the idea of
“on-the-spot” summonses for traffic
breaches on the lines followed in America,
where an alleged offender is given a card
to present to the magistrate next morning.
For minor breaches it would save official
time and administrative costs, to say
nothing of the cost and time of the in-
dividual.
Britain’s three nationalised airways lost
between them nearly £4 million from
April to September, not quite so bad as in
the corresponding six months of 1947,
but bad enough. The Ministry of Civil
Aviation says the final deficit for 1948 is
bound to exceed £8 million, though it is
“prosecuting remedial measures with
drastic vigor.” Drastic vigor, in Govern-
ment departments, means a slightly in-
creased flow of “please explains” and a
more than usual tide of plans.

“Smilo”: January is a month that is
hated by counter-clerks at the N. S. Wales
State Lottery office. Every second cus-
tomer proffers among the purchase-money
for his ticket a small brown object re-
sembling a button. When the surface be-
comes scratched its identity is revealed.
It is “pudding money”—sixpences and
threepences complete with the bouquet of
brandy or the reek of rum from the
doughy mess adhering to and embedded
in the design of the coin. No lottery fan
ever thinks of cleaning the coin ; it would
spoil the luck. Counter-girls in time be-
come connoisseurs of Christmas pudding,
but one of these days they will be putting
in a claim for dirt-money.

“Nakhoda”: Guerrilla warfare isn’t
likely to follow the collapse of the Re-
publican edifice in Java. The Achinese
conducted an intermittent war with the
Dutch for upwards of 30 years in
Sumatra, but that island is five times the
size of Java, had never been effectively
occupied and had huge areas which had
never been explored by white men. The
Dutch have dominated Java for 300 years,
have covered it with roads and railways
and know it as well as their homeland.
Moreover, they have aeroplanes and other
sudden modern forms of transport. A
Robin Hood or a Ned Kelly would stand
about as much chance of holding out in
the overpopulated island as he would
today in England.

“Becks”: Eleanor Roosevelt was on
one of the sub-committees which drafted
the Declaration of Human Rights
accepted by the latest session of U.N.O.
Writing in an American paper of the
amount of time wasted over inessentials,
she told how the Soviet delegate Pavlov
objected to a proposal to change the
wording of one sentence. The only pur-
pose of the change was to make the
sentence read more smoothly, but Pavlov
suspected a trap and said he was prepared
to talk for eight hours against the altera-
tion. He was voted down. On another
occasion English-speaking delegates sug-
gested that in articles where the phrases
“all people,” “every human being,” “every
individual” or “everyone” occurred it
would be better in the interests of clarity
and uniformity to use the one form
everyone.” The Cuban delegate objected
re S ar£ * to one clause on the ground
that “every human being” should be re-
tained as it included unborn babies,
whereas “everyone” did not. The Russian
delegate supported him, saying that “we
must do no harm to expectant mothers.”
i he incident explains a Paris newspaper’s
report that the proceedings of the session
ran into 10,000,000 words.

“Bo”: The scene was an animated
° n f- r - Evatt had his mouth open and
with magnificent confidence was directing
he affairs of the entire universe. The
Ukrainians and other Iron Curtain dele-
gates were huddled as if for protection
around M. Vyshinsky, who appeared to
he deeply interested in something going
on outside the window. Then into the
Babble Foundry burst that comic figure
the World Citizen, who had given up his
American nationality and 'had blithely,
but with poor judgment, cast himself on
U.N.O. Atavism being strong, M.
shinsky moved uneasily and furtively
from place to place around the hall as
if expecting the verbal bomb to be fol-
lowed by one that operates with a pin
and spring. The tension was so great as
the intruder was being bundled out along
with his shattered ideals that Bert Evatt
almost ceased talking. Fired by all the
excitement, a neurotic French delegate
leaped on a chair and with arms flailing
attempted to harangue the assemblage.
While he was being effectively gagged
Spiggotty delegates were waving their
arms with a vigor that would have made
Uncle trying to sell a customer a second-
hand suit seem dumb by comparison.
Amid the ensuing uproar Bert recovered
and kept up a steady flow of around 120
per minute. A second after the final
fadeout the mocking laughter of the two
kookaburras that proclaim the intro-
duction of the Australian newsreel, which
immediately , followed, rocked the theatre.
I like to think that the cove who arranged
the sequence of the reels possessed a sly
sense of humor.

“Jemac”: With Sydney’s fund-starved
University pretty well broke, and the
Senate begging for a 1949 grant increase
“You advertise for da organist ?”
of £150,000 —next year’s deficit is esti-
mated at £153,000 —the sum America is
injecting into its higher education, differ-
ences in population allowed for, is start-
ling by contrast. A commission of 28 out-
standing “educators” was appointed by
President Truman two years ago to report
on conditions affected by the return of
more than a million servicemen and the
post-war upsurge in enrolment, conditions
in kind which are duplicated here. The
commission’s report advocated among
other points that educational facilities
should be doubled, and increased support
should reach an annual outlay of
3,250,000,000 dollars by 1960. A stagger-
ing sum, «but the commission answered
opponents’ criticism of it succinctly:
“Higher education is an investment, not a
cost. It is an investment in social welfare,
better living standards, better health and
and less crime.” All sound educational
philosophy, and unchallengeable in any
country.

“Zake”; The creations of Tin Pan Alley
which the herd of groaners who infest
my radio yawp so lugubriously go
through various stages. The research men
seem to have temporarily exhausted the
classical mine after having dug out the
slow movements of Tschaikowsky’s Fifth
and Sixth symphonies and that of
Chopin’s Fantasie Impromptu. One of
these days someone will put them wise to
the bonanza buried in the andantes of
Haydn’s, Mozart’s and Beethoven’s
chamber works, and the horror of
classical prostitution will start again, with
‘‘tropical moon and glassy lagoon” or
“maybe and baby” having a shotgun
wedding with the brain-children of the
masters. Lately the geniuses have “dis-
covered” the old sentimental ballads our
fathers sang 40 years ago: “In the Shade
of the Old Apple Tree,” “Silver Threads
Among the Gold,” and so on. The great-
est horror is what they have done to the
old First World War song “Roses of
Picardy.” The awful, depressing thought
that must now weigh on T.P.A. is that
when these have run out they may be
compelled to “compose” songs without
benefit of dead men’s brains.

“Taswegian”: At the “open night” of
the technical school at Launceston (Tas.)
this year the art department presented,
instead of the usual showing of pencil-
and pen-sketches, oils, commercial adver-
tising, etc., a group of art students carry-
ing on their work under the public gaze.
A visiting couple stopped behind an artist
who was painting a still-life group
arranged tastefully a couple of yards
away. After breathing heavily down the
back of the artist’s neck for a few
seconds the woman asked her escort:
“What’s she painting?” He studied the
board again, glanced all around, and de-
livered his verdict; “I dunno ; but it ain’t
in this room.”

“F.S.”: The cabled announcement that
Michelangelo’s colossal statue “David”
leaves Italy next month on loan to the
U.S. reminds me of a mysterious cable
which appeared in the Australian dailies
just before Hitler erupted. The message
stated that a well-known Westrftlian
mining magnate had been so impressed
by Epstein’s “Genesis” that he had
.bought it, and the monstrous figure was
on its way to Fremantle per freighter.
Nothing further was heard about the
statue. Australian pressmen may miss
some things, but they are hardly likely
to have overlooked the arrival of a five-
ton immigrant as famous or notorious as
this one. If a U-boat sent it to the
bottom it is unlikely that the loss would
have passed unobserved by the sculptor,
the owner or the art world. Was the
story a furphy; or is Mrs. Genesis re-
posing unrecognised in somebody’s back-
yard or under a heap of rubbish in a
Fremantle goods-shed? The Michelangelo
sculpture has been public property for
500 years. It was carved by the great
Renaissance sculptor out of an enormous
block of marble on which another sculp-
tor, Agostino d’Antonio di Duccio, had
labored unsuccessfully half a century
earlier. It was erected on the terrace of
the Palace of the Signory at Florence in
1504 and removed to the Academy of
Fine Arts in 1882.

“Eureka”; A recent recruit for the
permanent Army expressed a preference
for either the signalling corps or some

“Harold Hardupp”: Add to the com-

of putting the domestic supplies in the
wrong canisters, the story of the people
who could never remember whether die
lottery-ticket was in the tea-holder, the
one that should hold the sugar but was
used for sago, or any of the mixed others.
When the papers announced that a big
prize had come their way a frantic search
was made through all the containers with-
out success. Full of fears of a theft the
family rushed to a lawyer, who prepared
affidavits aimed at preventing the prize
being grabbed by the wrong person. But
at the last moment they proved unneces-
sary. The ticket was found in the rice
caddy under the tea which had been
poured in on top of it when Mrs. Mixem
“cashed” the last of her tea coupons be-
fore they expired.

“One J.”: I have my doubts about
“Clooter” (B. 24/11 /’4B). Kids don’t use
slates these days. The filthy things were
hurled from the schools three or four
school-generations ago. Doubting the
slate, I also doubt the cat. I doubt the
existence of his neighbor’s dog, his wife’s
lilies, the cat’s concert, the brooms, boots,
lawnmower, milkman and even Mrs.
“Clooter” and the kid. The old boy is
probably a schoolkid of about 1890
vintage and a gay bachelor. I could
swallow his amusing account of the night's
rumpus if it were not for that
anachronistic slab of slate. Own up,
“Clooter” ; confess there wasn’t a slate
and perhaps I’ll believe the rest of the
yarn.

“X.S.”: Melbourne City Fathers will
have to have another think regarding their
project for solving the pigeon menace
with stuffed owls whose eyes glare and
blink. This device was tried on the New
York State Education Building. The
birds avoided the place the first day,
ventured within 15 yards the second and
on the third were perching on the owls’
heads. The latest method is an electronic
system which creates a field of static elec-
tricity and gives the pigeons a mild but
decided shock when they fly into it.

“Dee”: A substantial Brisbane building
which has survived many sneers about
/white elephants” to fulfil at long last
its original purpose is the Yungaba
Migrant Hostel at Kangaroo Point. Built
about 1885 as a migrant hostel, it has
served many purposes, including that of
hospital in the two wars, and is ideally
suited to the family units which are now
using it as a staging-house on their way
from ship to point of settlement. It has
dormitories, two kitchen units, large
dining- and recreation-rooms and big
playgrounds. A building of this character
with a history of more than 60 years is
a rare instance of prevision which has
borne fruit. Next year Queensland is
stepping up her intake of migrants ; 6000
is the official figure, but the authorities
hope to double it.

“Spokeshave”; The manager of a Mel-
bourne cinema, knocking-off for dinner,
came out of the theatre just in time to see
a man climb into his car and drive off.
Taking him for the assistant-manager,
who had a car of the same brand and
year, he took his car. He hadn’t gone far
on his homeward journey when he heard
the wail of a p.d. car, and found himself
being forced into the gutter. The assistant-
manager had seen him making off, had
taken him for a thief and rung the
coppers. The manager’s car had been
pinched by a real thief.

“Minto”; The Oriental mind? I was
staging in Leyte in 1945 on my way back
to Australia. At my hotel a shooting
foray in the next room brought up the
police at the double, but no one was
killed, as the cartridges were filled with
wax. The woman in the case confessed:
“I shot him with a blank because I love
him. I knew it wouldn’t hurt him,”

“Ell”: Don’t know about divers smok-
ing under water (B. 22/12/’4B), but there
was a case of a diver who went down
sober and came up drunk. He was work-
ing on a wreck, breaking out cargo and
sending it to the surface, and ignored
repeated tugs on his life-line inviting him
to come up and report the reason for the
sudden absence of visible results. When
the same thing happened next day, the
salvage-officer went over the cargo mani-
fest, and found a number of cases of
whisky listed. This explained where he
got it, but didn’t clear up the mystery of
how the grog got inside the diver’s suit
and thence into the diver. Later investi-
gation disclosed a pocket of air, trapped
in an upper corner of the hold when the
ship heeled over, and supplemented by
the air bubbles escaping from the diver’s
valve, until it made a space about 2ft.
deep. Here the diver was able to “sur-
face,” unscrew his face-glass, and with
60ft. of sea over his head and the water
lapping two inches from his chin, knock
the neck off a bottle and enjoy a drink.
To avoid interruption from the surface,
and to defeat any attempts to haul him
up he took a turn with his lifeline round
a stanchion. Siebe Gorman’s interesting
and informative Deep Diving vouches for
the tale.
FORTY-NINE
Step in, young chap, to the usual chorus
Of hopeful welcome, your age-old due.
What have you got in your wallet for us,
What do you hold for a world that’s new?
Will you leave it better than what you find it,
A stepping-stone and a marking-line
To the years ahead from the years behind it?
What are you bringing us, Forty-Nine?
Will you help the nations, war-worn and weary,
Compose fresh sources of quarrels stirred
By peace-time parleys, and end the dreary
And wasting sickness of hopes deferred?
Maybe that’s rather too much to ask you,
Still, it’s a problem you can’t decline
Whether you like it or not, a task you
Will have to tackle, young Forty-Nine.
The world might find it a bit surprising
To wake and look at, one well believes,
Greece and her neighbors fraternising
Or Jews and Arabs as thick as thieves.
Or Russians showing a less unpleasant
Front where all other Powers combine.
But, could you manage it, what a present
You’d have in your satchel, Forty-Nine!
Will you usher in a happier era,
Secure from menace of crooks and Corns,
Banish for ever the grim chimera
Of blood and slaughter and atom bombs?
Will you leave us nearer that dim Utopia
Framed to Sir Thomas More’s design
With what you’ve packed in your cornucopia
For vexed humanity, Forty-Nine?
Who knows? Well, no one —that much is
certain—•
Not even the astrologic clan
Who read the planets to lift the curtain
That hides the future —or kid they can.
With harder times we may yet be coping
Or not. Your guess is as good as mine.
But the deeper the gloom there’s more room
for hoping,
Step in and good luck to you, Forty-Nine!

T. THE R.


Storky Adams on Pelaco’s “Mine
tinkit”:
As the originator of the abo. in the shirt I
would like to clarify a few points in the J. L. G.
Law contribution (B. 1/12/’4B). When the
young combination of Pearson and Law started
out to make shirts, an advertising firm sold
’em the idea of a poster depicting a corpulent
managing-director type of chappie in a dress-
shirt, I saw it on the hoardings while travelling
along St. and was convinced it
would never sell shirts. By the time I reached
Princes Bridge I had the idea of the abo. in
the shirt. I went in to see my old friend Fred
Miller, of the J. J. Miller theatrical printing
firm, told him my idea and then rang up Law
and asked him if he would be interested in
a sketch with a view to hitting the public from
the hoardings. Law welcomed the idea, so
Fred sent for the “Mad Russian,” Tom
Mockeridge. I explained what I wanted, and
Miller and Mockeridge went to the Royal
Arcade and found a 3d. postcard with a good
abo. head. Mockeridge produced the sketch
from that. It was accepted by Pearson and
Law with Lin Law’s snappy slogan, and Fred
Miller produced the poster which hit the hoard-
ings. It caused something of a sensation. Dear
old ladies wrote to the papers and protested
against the “indecency” of the abo. in the lone
shirt, but that was all to the good. Pelaco was
on its way and never looked back. As for
Mulga Fred, not a soul associated with the idea
ever heard of him until a reporter tied him in
after he had gone west,

“Oxmead”: For a final word on this
“hanging, drawing and quartering” sym-
posium, how about an extract from
Pepys’ diary, dated October 13, 1660 —old
Sam rarely missed the opportunity of
attending anything in the nature of a
public spectacle?
I went out to Charing Cross to see
Major-general Harrison hanged, drawn and
quartered; which was done there, he look-
ing as cheerful as any man could in that
condition.
Restrained comment could hardly go
further than that.
* * * *
“Laetitia”: That the Scots should be
the last British stock to repeal the legisla-
tion which hitherto made lawful the
good old diversion of drawing and
quartering is not surprising. It is
characteristic of the race’s reluctance to
give up anything—even cannibalism,
which was practised as late as the end of
the seventeenth century by a border sept,
headed by a gentleman named Sawney
Bean. Sawney’s practice of twice sur-
rounding his Sassenach enemies—once on
the field of battle and once at mealtimes
—was terminated when Judge Jeffries
made the whole sept dance on empty air
and then had them drawn and quartered.
Though Judge Jeffries’s politics were not
popular this act was acclaimed by
Sawney’s Scottish neighbors; they had
looked forward uneasily to the time when
he would have eventually been faced with
a shortage of edible Englishmen. Come
to think of it —Is there any British law
against cannibalism, provided it is not
preceded by murder?

“Paranoia”: Police did object to
Chidley’s semi-nude attire, and he was
continually harassed and moved on.
The Answer was adjudged indecent by
the N.S.W. Full Court, Mr, Justice
Harvey presiding. Chidley was declared
insane by Dr. Chisholm Ross and other
Government medicos, but the Chidley
defence mustered other doctors who
differed from officialdom. Chidley, was
given a bond, provided he did not lecture
or sell The Answer. I still have a copy
of the book marked “For adult circula-
tion only”; Havelock Ellis described it
as “the most remarkable book Australia
has produced.” The booklet Chidley sold
in public was only the latter portion of
his complete edition of History of
Philosophy.

“Uco”: The Grand Opera season has
brought to the Sydney papers the usual
spate of letters from people who seem to
look upon opera as a thing to be regarded
by both performers and audience as
something in the nature of a revealed
religion into the rites of which only true
devotees may enter. If an enthusiastic
patron seeing his first opera claps at the
wrong moment the letter-writers suggest
he should stay away from shows he
doesn’t understand; if the “resting”
members of the company applaud their
colleagues at the right time they are
accused of acting as cheer-leaders —beg
pardon, a claque. But the writer who
amused me most was the one who com-
plained about a “dead” artist coming to
life again to take a curtain-call. He
claimed that “no really great artist would
so dispel the illusion he had created. He
would ‘stay dead’ until the next perform-
ance.” That is sheer nonsense. The
theatre is make-believe, and at the
final curtain-fall the show is over and
reality returns. Even the greatest artist
enjoys applause and looks for it. And,
after all, the patron pays for one per-
formance only ; he doesn’t take a lifetime
lease of the show.

“Melbn”: Grandiose schemes are being
hatched to meet the possibility of Mel-
bourne being chosen for the 1956
Olympic Games. A huge two-ring circus
or stadium is to be built with State,
finance on the site of the R.A.S. show-
ground, to fit in with plans for modernisa-
tion of the present jumble of unco-
ordinated pens, sheds and arena. It will
seat 70,000, and there will be a swimming-
pool, diving-pool and accommodation for
4000 competitors, as well as h.q. for Vic-
torian amateur sports organisations.
After the games the grounds will revert
to the Shorthorns, Clydesdales and
Merinos, but will be available for general

Pacific and Australian meetings. It is con-
fidently expected that the place will be

Aires are competitors with Melbourne

Ja r y ' ls J? ot , on Y m R °y al c,rc l es
that the name Charles has been in dis-

the general prejudice against it doesn’t
go back to Hanoverian times or anything
like it. When 1 was a youngster 1

numbered several Charleses among my
acquaintances r , I still know some, but
they have all carried the name for 30
years or more. That fact is, I think, a
clue to the reason for the dropping of
Charlie as a baptismal name. Around
about the time of the First World War
a little man with baggy trousers, billycock
hat, swagger cane and boots that turned
up at the toes was making a name for
himself as the world’s greatest comedian.
The Charlie Chaplin of those days was
loved by all the world, but what mother
worthy of the name would dream of
calling her son after a clown? There
may be other reasons for the eclipse of
Charles, but I’ll back that one. The
eclipse is now over; a study of birth
notices since the young prince arrived
show that thet Charleses are fighting back
again.
“Charles”: Grin in disbelief if you like,
but there has been a distinct warming
towards us by certain hitherto disdainful
circles in our somewhat snooty suburb
since the missus is now able to introduce
me as “My husband, Charles; same
name as the Prince, you know.”

“Muskeen”: Tattersall, referred to by
The Bulletin’s Service Department (B.
1/12/’4B), was a very economical and
practical individual. When Highflyer
died, it was suggested that he be skinned
and stuffed, as had been done in the case
of Eclipse. Tattersall’s reply to the sug-
gestion was that he had stuffed the animal
full enough with hay and corn when he
.was alive and producing money, and did
not see the use of stuffing him with hay
after he was dead, and could no longer
cover,

“Cornstalk”: Amateur elocutionists
(B. 27/10/ ’48)? The reciter who let a
tear drop in Stonewall’s beer had a twin
soul in a woman I once heard render
“The Volunteer Organist,” a lugubrious
old piece in which the parson called for
a volunteer to deputise for a sick organ-
ist. A poor old derelict totters up the
aisle, gives a polished display of skill at
the organ, collapses on to the keys and
dies. The elocutionist got him half-way
up the aisle and explained his feebleness
with the statement that “Hunger was
gnawing at his vittles.”

“Clooter”: I suppose my mind was
absorbed with the Christmas problems;
anyhow I’m dashed if I could find my
studs as, .shirted, trousered and shod, 1
picked up collar and tie. I searched the
dressing-table and “the demesnes there-
unto adjacent,” crawled under the bed,
felt under the wardrobe, searched vest
and coat pockets. Then, with that re-
straint which comes only with maturity,
I lit a cigarette, sat down and carefully
recalled my actions of the previous night.
Yes, the memory was distinct —I’d placed
those studs on the dressing-table. That
put the onus on Mrs. Clooter. I found
her in the laundry. She blew a wisp of
hair from her eyes, wiped the suds from
her arms and, with that air of affection-
ate exasperation which every married
man has to endure, went to the bedroom
to get my studs. Ten minutes later, de-
feated, we debated whether a horse or
something had got into the room and
eaten them, whether I could safely wear
a sports shirt to work, whether the neigh-
bor might have some spare studs. He
had, and was quite willing to lend them,
and we spent a humorous few minutes
discussing the vagaries of wives. I re-
turned, picked up the collar anil then
found the borrowed studs wouldn’t go
into the shirt-holes because the lost studs
were there. Without a word I smuggled
them into my pocket, inserted the bor-
rowed ones and swiftly departed for the
safety of the thronged city,
* * * *
“Pronto”: A friend had been made a
K.C., so I sent him a congratulatory tele-
gram. In it I assured him that this was
one occasion when I was not “agin”
the Government. The clerk at the tele-
graph counter pointed to this word and
asked what it was. He said it was not
in the dictionary. I asked whether he re-
fused to accept the telegram. He said
“No,” he was only watching the interests
of “them” upstairs who had to dispatch
the telegrams. It was sent as I wrote it,
but he probably still thinks I’m illiterate.

empty baby-food tins among the litter of
war in New Guinea, Some of these tins
bore instructions in different tongues and
characters, including Chinese. One of
our fellows got an American flag and

A whispering-«ampaign began, and pre-
sently along came the Yanks to dicker

now probably a treasured trophy some-
where in U.S.A.

“F.S.”: Those items picked by editors
as the biggest news of 1948 (B. 22/12/’4B)
may seem important now, but I hazard
the suggestion that in 2048 the biggest
news of 1948 will be none of them, ex-
cept perhaps Gandhi’s assassination. The
rest won’t even be remembered. Nobody
knows what is the biggest news of 1948
yet. For all we know there may be a
Socrates wandering around the streets of
Melbourne, there may be a Rembrandt
painting masterpieces in a Sydney attic
or a great teacher promulgating a new
ethic in Timbuctoo, Tibet or Venezuela,
without hitting the headlines any more
than did his great predecessor in Judea.
Probably in 20 years hence Messrs. Tru-
man and Marshall and Mesdames
Chiang and Kasenkina will only be re-
membered by a few quiz fanatics. How
many people can now name the states-
men and generals of World War One?

“D.8.K.”: Reports of an explosion in
the engine-room of the P. and O. liner
Sudan off Kobe brought me shuddersome
memories. As a junior engineer I saw
steam at its worst in icy waters in the
Kaisar-i-Hind in 1921. Three days out
from St. John’s, Newfoundland, a crack
developed in the main steam-line leaving
No. 1 boiler. The boiler-engineer, with
the junior fourth, climbed up to investi-
gate. Seeing the crack enlarge suddenly,
the b.e. pushed the fourth off the boiler
top and jumped himself. They were busy
with slice and shovel drawing the fire
when the worst happened—the 18in.
steam-line blew open like tissue paper. At
2101 b. to the inch the eight boilers blasted
that forrard stokehold to a shambles in
a few seconds, searing to a ghastly end
those unfortunates who tried to escape up
the fiddley ladders. The third and fourth
engineers crawled, face to the plates,
along the agonising length of the stoke-
holds between the boilers and were
hauled into the engine-room frightfully
scalded, but alive. The boiler-engineer
suffered injuries beyond, recovery and
succumbed later. The ship, with no head
of steam left, wallowed among icebergs -
as we strove desperately to shut off the
intermediate stop-valves and then blank
off the line to the isolated boiler. The
sight that met our eyes in the stokehold
remains through the years. I would
rather face h.e. any day than pent-up
high-pressure steam.

THE SERVICE MAN
British Territorials.
“Ek Dum”: The difference
between the Australian and
British outlooks on military de-
fence is shown clearly by the
varying attitudes of the two
countries on training and the
peace-time Army.
Here there are virtually three
armies—the “permanent” Army,
which wouldn’t make a real ser-
vice brigade group, plus home
administration; the “interim
Army,” that makeshift thing
which is neither flesh nor fowl;
and the Citizen Army, which,
but for the enthusiasm of its
officers and men, would be
merely an impermanent shadow,
a political something created
perfunctorily as a shield against
political outcry rather than as a
protection against attack.
The British position is very
different. Despite the fact that
the Socialist Government has
whittled defence to a minimum,
it still has a public opinion to
contend with which has forced
it to keep a framework in being.
Events are now inducing it to
try to restore the position to one
of safety. Given time, it will
succeed, or if it doesn’t it will
be thrown out and somebody
flse will take over the task and
do it.
The basic organisation of the
post-war British Army was re-
cently described in a Royal
U.S.I. lecture in London by
Major-General G. W. E. Erskine,
C. 8., D. 5.0., one of whose an-
cestors was at one time Lieu-
tenant-Governor of New South
Wales and whom the A.I.F. will
remember as B.G.S. XVIII
Corps at Alamein and Acting
C.G.S., Eighth Army. Later he
to6k over the Seventh (Desert
Rats) Armored Division, led it
through Sicily and Italy and took
it home for the landing on D-
Day. He is now Director of the
British Territorial Army.
He emphasised that in Britain
there is one Army. Of this the
parts fit together closely and
their functions are closely de-
fined.
As the nucleus there is the
Regular Army. .This sends out
oversea garrisons and small
mobile regular reserves to meet
peace-time emergencies. It trains
the National Service man during
his 12 months’ compulsory ser-
vice and gives various other
forms of assistance.
It provides a nucleus of
officers necessary for the Terri-
torial Army, which is a volun-
tary body supplementary to the
National Army. It carries out
the command and staff arrange-
ments of the Territorials above
unit level.
National Service
The National Service men
form the body of the main de-
fensive force, compulsorily
enlisted. They serve under the
1947 Act for 12 months con-
tinuously—the Government is in
process of increasing the period
to 18 months. It has been
generally recognised that 12
months is not sufficient under
existing conditions to make a
finished soldier, but the Gov-
ernment has made a concession
to urgent industrial needs. It is
not possible for Government de-
partments and selfish employers
to interfere with the training of
National Service men in Britain
as they do, to the country’s
shame, here, by refusing to allow
them time off to serve. The
claims of defence in the United
Kingdom are paramount.
The National Service man’s
liability is for continuous ser-
vice during his period in uni-
form. He is, for all practical
purposes, a permanent soldier
during that period, liable to be
sent anywhere in the world
where he is needed. He is also
liable for 60 days’ training in
the reserve spread over six
years, of which not more than 21
days is given in any one year.
During his permanent period
he serves with the Regular
Army. During his reserve
periods of training he is drafted
to some Territorial unit near
his place of residence or work.
Technicians and specialists go
to a special arm of the reserve.
Normally the compulsory re-
servist does eight days’ camp
and four days’ instruction
in each of five years, his last
year being free if he has com-
pleted 60 days.
Volunteers can enlist for a
minimum of four years in the
reserve, which means that they
contract to do 15 days’ training
per annum, plus 15 two-hour
evening “drills.” Of each 15
days eight days must be in camp.
There are special inducements
to all servicemen to become
volunteers, since it is realised
that no man will volunteer unless
enthusiastic.
The Territorial (reserve)
Order of Battle of the British
National Army includes six in-
fantry divisions, two armored
divisions, an air-borne division,
a number of independent in-
fantry and armored brigades,
“ Dammit, I've forgotten what happens now,
Prendergast !”
ack-ack groups, Royal En-
gineers, Royal Corps of Sig-
nallers, Ordnance, etc. Recruit-
ing has been open for these units
for a year, and the Command
will be satisfied to have them in
1950 on a cadre basis of 25 per
cent, to provide future leadership
The Territorial system ob-
viously cannot be working in
bulk of enlistment till 1950, when
the first batches of 12-months’
servicemen finish their terms.
The cadre organisation is part
of a system which could provide
a pattern into which to fit the
3,000,000 trained men now
available in the United King-
dom if an emergency arose.
When the Territorial system
is in full swing Major-General
Erskine pictures its set-up some-
what as follows:
The Territorial unit should
be strong in officers. Most of
them will be Territorial officers
with war experience. There will
be a Regular adjutant and a
Regular quartermaster. The
C.O. might be a Regular if no
suitable T.A. officer is available.
If a T.A. officer commands it
will be the Army aim to provide
him with a suitable Regular
field-officer to help in training.
Among juniors will be some who
have just completed their year’s
training with the Regular Army.
The W.Os. and sergeants will, as
far as possible, be well leavened
with old hands. There will be
some Regular permanent staff
instructors probably posted
each for two years and a part
of the establishment of the T.A.
and not merely on loan as
formerly. For the ranks it will
only rarely be a case of recruit-
ing an untrained civilian. There
will be great competition for the
best of the National Service men
of each year.
From 1950 onwards it is esti-
mated that the numbers of
National Service men in the
Territorial ranks will increase by
about 8000 per month.
“Amenities”
The Territorial Army is
to be regarded as part
of the Army as a whole,
and everything in it will be done
on that assumption. At the
same time a very specific
attempt is to be made to carry
out the principles often advo-
cated in this page —that the ac-
tivities of Territorial (citizen)
units shall be linked with those
of the community in which it
functions.
The name “drill hall” as the
centre of district Territorial ac-
tivity is to be discouraged. In
the parlance of the new De-
fence Force it is the “Territorial
Army Centre,” such £nd such a
branch. It is to be designed on
the principle that it shall pro-
vide not only for military facili-
ties but also for social amenities.
As many unit bases as possible
are to cover a battalion or regi-
mental area. Usually it is hoped
to build them up on a company,
battery or squadron basis.
The ideal set out by the
British Territorial Army scheme
is to provide facilities for train-
ing under cover and for gun-
drill, tank-drill, miniature rifle-
range, technical-training equip-
ment, lecture-room and tactical
model-room.
Close at hand to H.Q. there
should be proper garages for
training vehicles.
As part of the main building
there should be offices for the
C. 0., adjutant and Q.M. and a
clothing and equipment store.
The social amenities are
based on provision of proper
officers’ and sergeants’ messes and
canteens and recreation-rooms
for o.rs., the whole to give the
unit a home in which it can
entertain and live its social life
in general.
It is recognised that this will
take some time to implement.
In some cases it is proposed to
buy Regular Army barracks, in
others to procure the land and
gradually develop the facilities.
.But the policy will be pursued
to fruition, since it has come to
be recognised that unless a unit
has a proper home and can treat
it like a home and have its
friends there and carry on its
communal life comfortably.
Territorial Army training will
never be part of the life of the
community or even of all of
those who take part in it.
No More ‘‘Dingy Buildings”
In dealing with this phase
Major-General Erskine said:
We have never before had a Terri-
torial Army of anything like the size
which we shall have by 1955. It will
be necessary to review the scale and
•standard of accommodation. Our
600,000 men will be the pick of the
manhood of the country, and the
T.A. centre must be a place of which
the unit is proud. Dingy buildings
in back streets are not acceptable.
I doubt if even the best buildings we
have today are good enough—do not
think the club life of these men will
be satisfied with beer, whist-drives and
dancing. I would like to see more
opportunities for the manly sports
and games which the Britisher loves,
but at which he so often has to be
a spectator because of the lack of
opportunities—young men will want
to box, play football, and improve
their skill at the gymnasium and at
track events. They will, we hope,
have had a taste of these things
during their year with the Regular
Army It is my belief that the
T.A. centre of the future will have
to pay much inore attention to

providing natural and healthy pursuits
for the young man.
Under the British scheme
peace-time administration of the
Territorial Army will be carried
out by County Territorial Asso-
ciations for the War Office. This
is calculated to stimulate civic
pride and a spirit of competi-
tion.
The Associations will initiate
and carry out the building pro-
grammes of the force and main-
tain the buildings when com-
plete. They will also furnish the
buildings, provide heat, light and
amenities. They will act as re-
tailers of the uniforms and
equipment provided in bulk by
the Army and they will carry
out recruiting.
They, of course, have nothing
to do with the actual officering
and military control. But under
the system the local unit be-
comes a natural growth as part
of the community life. Terri-
torial Association work is all
voluntary, and it gives an oppor-
tunity for patriotic citizens be-
yond military age to take part
in the defence effort.
The British Territorial com-
mand is faced, in some phases,
with the same difficulties as in
Australia. The nationalised in-
dustries seem to be the worst
bugbear. Their heads are apt to
refuse to encourage their em-
ployees to give extra time to
camps. But there, at any rate,
the rate of pay for volunteers is
sufficient to make most ordinary
workers eager to go. A one-
star private, for instance, gets
for an eight-day camp £2 pay,
plus £2 marriage allowance and
£4 camp duty and some extras.
The Army-centres scheme will
take some years to implement,
but the salient fact is that the
British Army has adopted prin-
ciples which should revolution-
ise the attitude of thousands of
young men toward peace-time
service.
The Newest Air
Giants.
“Ek Dum”: While Australia
is still playing with Mustangs
and obsolescent types of
bombers, the last edition of
Jane’s All the World’s Aircraft
seems unimpressed. Our pot-
tering with Nenes is not im-
pressive in the light of the fact
that a large number of coun-
tries, including Russia, have
licences to build them —let’s
hope they haven’t also the alloys
and the technical skill.
Russia also appears to have
all the latest German jets at the
end of World War 11, together
with the German technicians
to help develop them. They
even have the B.M.W.
018, the heaviest and biggest
aero-turbine yet made, but not
much of a proposition so far as
long life goes, unless the
Russians have made consider-
able improvements.
Engines generally, whether
piston-type or the various forms
of jet, have made enormous
strides, both in actual power-
output and in power-for-weight.
In the middle of World War I
power units were round about 40
h.p.—perhaps not so much. In
1946 there was not a single listed
piston engine over 3000 h.p.
Now there are seven, of which
one of the heaviest and most
powerful is the Lycoming XR
7755, 127 litres, h.p. 5000,
pound/h.p. 1.21. It is interest-
ing to note that the altitude at
which sea-level power can be
kept up has risen to 30,000 feet.
The best British and U.S.
turbines now claim power-
weight ratio four times as good
as that of any piston engine.
The Nene rates 0.231 b. for its
7000 h.p.
• American aircraft are an ex-
ample of what is happening to
change the air-fighting world.
Their figures are somewhat
flamboyant and indefinite, as
when the N.A. 140 is claimed
—without any other data being
given—to have a speed of “more
than 650 m.p.h.”
In production in the U.S.A.
there are at least half a dozen
jet bombers which make the air-
craft of the last war look like
buggies in point of speed.
The 847, which is going into
large production, has a span of
116 ft., weighs, all up, 60 tons.
The main wheels are in tandem
and retract into the body. The
wings, fin and tailplane sweep
back at an angle of 45 degrees.
The total horsepower is 40,000
—the same as the 29,000-ton
British battleships of the Royal
Sovereign class and only 5000
h.p. less than Nelson and Rod-
ney, making some allowance for
U.S. standards. Nobody has
mentioned its speed.
But the X 845, with wing-span
of about 89ft., a few feet more
than that of the sterling old
Wellington, and powered by four
Allisons giving 27,000 h.p., is
rated at a speed of 500 m.p.h.
These are babes beside the
Northrop Y 849, which will have
eight Allisons giving 54,000
h.p.!
And Britain is certainly not
behind in design—indeed, some
people believe considerably
ahead. Some of the civil adap-
tations are just as staggering as
the U.S. types of warcraft.
Reckoning one pound of thrust
at one h.p. at 375 m.p.h., it is
suggested that Bristol Brabazon
11, with four coupled pairs of
Proteus engines, will rate 32,000
h.p, and the new Saunders-Roe
flying boat with six Proteus units
—four coupled pairs and a single
in each wing—will rate 40,000
h.p.
Britain and the Atomic
Bomb.
“Ek Dum”: One of the
scientists of the Canberra Gov-
ernment, Dr. D. F. Martyn,
head of the Radio Research
Division of the C.5.1.R., urges
that “unless Britain reduces her
population, her only hope of
survival lies in peace.”
He has a constructive plan
for helping her to survive, his
thesis being based on his opinion
that, although the U.S. and
Russia could not be crippled by
the atom bomb because of their
wide dispersion of industry,
Britain would be indefensible in
atom warfare. He is certain
that fast jet bombers could get
through to bohib the ports, and
he writes:-
I base my opinion on a scientific
analysis of the consequences of atomic
energy by a distinguished and suc-
cessful operational research scientist,
Professor P. M. Blackett, who last
month was awarded the Nobel Prize
for Physics.
So he suggests sending
20,000,000 people from Britain
to the Dominions. Australia
(he says) could absorb a large
number of these, and the Aus-
tralian Government is aware of
the need for greater population
for defence. He is a little
hot under the collar that all
parties in Britain are opposed
to this sane measure “for poli-
tical reasons.”
All this goes to prove how
little scientists are able to reason
according to the process of mili-
tary and political commonsense
and how trusting he is in deal-
ing with his “authorities.” One
glance at Dr. Blackett’s estima-
tion of the position of Hiroshima
after the bombing would rule
him out as an authority, for he
makes a point in his book of
the fact that “the big plants on
the periphery of the city were
almost completely undamaged
and 94 per cent, of their workers
unhurt. These factories ac-
counted for 74 p.c. of the indus-
trial production of the city.”
These factories were un-
damaged, actually, because they
were right outside the radius of
the area covered by the effects
of the explosion, an area per-
haps two miles by three miles,
at the least optimistic level.
Within 1000 yards of the
centre of the explosion most
buildings were pulverised or
burnt because they were about
as stable as a pack of cards.
The dozen reasonably solid
buildings—even those over a
hundred yards from the centre
of the blast —the Chamber of
Commerce Building, the local
departmental store, the city hall,
the banks, the Red Cross Hos-
pital are all standing today and
intact and in use. In most of
them the bulk of the inmates
were killed, but (despite uncerti-
fied tales) it is doubtful if there
were many in them. Even then
some of those survived. Re-
member that atomic defence at
that stage was not born or
thought of.
What Removal Means
The removal of 20,000,000 of
Britain’s population, as it might
seem to any careful thinker,
would have a doUble-barrelled
effect. While it might reduce
food requirements, the reduction
would only be a matter of
degree. It would, also, reduce
manpower, military personnel
potential and industrial potential
to a hopeless extent, since if the
population were to be scientifi-
cally cut with a view to keeping
sufficient people to feed the
30,000,000 remaining, the emi-
gration would have to come very
largely from the industrial
population. And in any case
these would not be safe be-
cause the country would still
have to concentrate industry and
import defence materials.
Moreover, under present con-
ditions this wholesale emigra-
tion would also reduce the per-
man defence materiel output of
the British Commonwealth.
And if a fair proportion of
the 20,000,000 came here it
would certainly be difficult to
feed them even in peace-time,
much less in war-time. Even a
large section of the present
7.500.000 can’t always get pota-
toes.
Furthermore, they would
cease, upon coming here, to be
freely available for the defence
of the Commonwealth at large
because the present type of
Commonwealth Government
would freeze tens of thousands
of them into the C.C.C. and a
very large number into the
Militia, so that it would not be
possible to send them to the
centre of the conflict (which will
not be in Australia) to defend
Britain.
The Status of Atom-bombing
The effects of atom-bombing
so far suggest that defence can
be best assured in concentra-
tion as well as by dispersion.
Solid earth appears to form a
sure barrier, and so does a few
feet Or inches of concrete and
other materials.
It is unthinkable that an
atom-bomb over a London pre-
pared in advance would have
had the same effects as over
Hiroshima, a ramshackle
Oriental town built largely of
bamboo and highly inflammable
pine. A very great deal of the
damage done in Hiroshima was
the direct result of fire caused
by a high wind.
The same applied in other
Japanese cities which were sub-
jected to bombing with fire and
H.E.
In Japan, according to
General Arnold, over 100,000
tons of bombs were dropped in
15.000 sorties on 66 Japanese
cities, and this quantity
all told —42,000 tons of it in a
month —blasted out only 169
square miles, of which the bulk
was burnt out by raging fires.
In the war against Germany
these bombings, which abso-
lutely wiped out nearly all the
big Japanese cities, would have
had comparatively little effect.
More than nine times the
amount was dropped on Europe
—most of it H.E.
There is a widespread delu-
sion that the atom - bomb
brought about the collapse of
Japanese morale; but this is
not so.
The members of the U.S.
Strategic Bombing Survey
wrote;
Based on a detailed investigation
of all the facts, and supported by
the testimony of the surviving Japanese
leaders involved, it is the Survey’s
opinion that certainly prior to De-
cember 31, 1945, and in all proba-
bility before November 1, 1945,
Japan would have surrendered even
if the atomic bombs had not been
dropped, even if Russia had not
entered the war, and even if no in-
vasion had been planned or con-
templated.
General Arnold, who com-
manded the U.S, Air Force
which bombed Japan, declared
that “even before one of our
829 s dropped the atomic bomb
on Hiroshima, Japan’s military
situation was hopeless,” and this
fact Admiral Nimitz attributes
to Japan’s loss of shipping,
which coranletelv naralvsed her.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Target for tonight. Ralph S. Peer, the
American who invented hillbilly music,
is in Sydney.
Sir James Bisset, war-time driver
of the two Queens, returned to
Melbourne recently, this time on
shore-legs. On his first visit here,
in a windjammer 91 days out from
Liverpool in 1898, young Bisset got his
first taste of salt-water. It came
from the scuppers and it was poured
down his gullet by an unsympathetic
first mate who found him skulking in his
bunk in the throes of seasickness. In
50 years’ seafaring he was never sick
again. Doctor’s orders put Bisset to sea.
Taken to the medico by a mother fearful
for her puny child, he heard: “Let him
go to sea —it’s the only thing that’ll save
him.” Now retired, Sir James is hale,
hearty and packed with anecdotal Vitality.
In the Queen Mary once his radio-
operator phoned his cabin to tell him the
ship had just been sunk with all hands
by the Jap radio. The captain told him
to hang on, climbed on deck, had a check-
ing look round, returned and assured
the radioman the Japs were up a tree.
But the great ship’s whereabouts dur-
ing the war was not always a close secret:
when she made a supposedly surrepti-
tious call on Sydney thousands of wait-
ing welcomers lined the harbor shores.
Stefan Haag, conductor, musician and
singer who, in Melbourne, distinguished
on all three fronts in
the one week by his performance as
Papageno in “The Bartered Bride” at the
Princess, his vocal part in the experiment
of the Rambert season at His Majesty’s,
when song was mixed with dancing, and
his conducting of the choral section of
the “Messiah” at the Town Hall, has a
musical ancestry that dates back to
Haydn, inasmuch as that composer
founded the famous Viennese Boys’ Choir,
which brought Haag to Melbourne, When
Austria threw in with Hitler the choir-
conductor was interned and the boys
were distributed among Melbourne
citizens. Haag sang in St. Patrick’s
Cathedral choir for a space and then
continued his musical education. He is
23 and one of the most promising of
Melbourne’s young musicians.
“Fitz”: Oscar Walters, “Westralian Worker”
editor and a fine Bulletin poet, died in Perth
last month in true newspaper style. At 1 p.m.
he sent his paper to press; half an hour later
he collapsed in the street and died before he
reached hospital in an ambulance. Born 59
years ago in Victoria, he was working under-
ground at Sandstone (W.A.) when World War
1 broke out. Enlisting in the A.1.F., he served
with the 3rd Field Engineers at Gallipoli and
in France and Belgium. At Sandstone, he
wrote for the “Worker” before be enlisted,
and on his return from the war was a regular
contributor until John Curtin, then editor,
persuaded him to join the staff. After some
years in Kalgoorlie, Walters was appointed
editor when Fred Gates, who had succeeded
Curtin, died. As a poet his forte and merit
lay in the easy swing of his verse and the
simple directness of his diction. There was
something of Lawson’s easy bush philosophy in
him and the tinge of pessimism beneath the
tolerance. Published in 1931, his Shrapnel
Green and Other Verses held the pick of the
war verse he wrote for The Bulletin in the
’twenties. In them he vignetted the more
vivid impressions he brought back from
Gallipoli and France, and in them also he
displayed the same quiet observation which
enabled him to give in other Bulletin verses
striking little glimpses into the old life he knew
on the track, in the outback settlements and
around the alluvial patches. His “The Drink
Before You Go,” printed in the 1927 Christmas
Number of The Bulletin, is typical of his
outback verse and the one most asked for by
Bulletin readers. Outwardly shy and self-
effacing, he was a vigorous writer on industrial
and political matters and was one of the first
in the W.A. Labor movement to challenge the
Communists.
Anew McMaster will present a new
Othello when the Stratford-on-Avon
Players come to Melbourne Princess in
the New Year. Hq is one of England’s
leading Shakspearean actors and has
smothered Desdemona in places as far
apart as Dublin and Cairo. Standing
six-foot-two in his socks, blonde and dis-
tinguished-looking, he is regarded as one
of the greatest Svengalis. Playing oppo-
site him will be Daphne Slater, the 20-
year-old niece of Edwin Styles. Australia
is already acquainted with her; she was
in the film “The Courtneys of Curzon
Street.” A Royal Academy of Art gold-
medal winner, she was selected out of
1000 by the judges, one of whom was
Laurence Olivier, to play Juliet in the
Stratford festival of 1947. The veteran
of the company is Eric Maxon, who has
played in Shakspeare’s birthplace for 20
years and never missed a season.
The Australian Squadron is now a
Fleet, and Rear-Admiral Farncomb will
tranship his flag to carrier Sydney when
she arrives. He’s sure to take a broom —
a new one —with him.
“El Verdugo’s” tribute:
Dr. Max Hertz, 72, who died last week in
Sydney, was one of the most efficient ortho-
paedic surgeons in Australia, though denied
membership of the B.M.A. during World War I
because of his “enemy origin.” The shy, gruff
Teuton played a lone hand afterwards through
the years, but this did not deter him from
doing many a free piece of work for Diggers
and for poor people. His hospital at Rush-
cutter Bay was always a hive of industry, and
the cases in which he was not paid were almost
as numerous as those in which he was.
To see him operate—especially if you were
his victim and under a “local” was not
always pleasant, for he ripped up feet which
had gone wrong with the sure, quick touch
of a dressmaker correcting a wrong seam, but
in the end the results were often miraculous.
Gratitude he repelled with a gruffness which
was. m’ore than half shyness, and his methods
of preventing*’patients from paying him were
sometimes original. “Why don’t you brush
your coat?” he once brusquely asked a tired-
looking Digger. “Your wife will cease to love
you if you do not keep yourself neat. Give
it to me!” He retired into some recess with
the garment. When the Digger got home he
found his fee back in his pocket. And the
Doctor refused to admit that he knew any-
thing about it. There are many people walking
about comfortably this festive season who would
be in wheel-chairs if it were not for Hertz.
Harry Cobby, here revealed by
Mcßeath, is described in the official
history of the Kaiser’s war as “One of
the most daring spirits in the Australian
Flying Corps.” His D. 5.0., D.F.C. and
two bars confirm the description. A bank
clerk at the outbreak, he finished with a
tally of 34 Hun aircraft shot down and
victor in five other single combats. In
March, 1918, he was leading a flight of
Camels over Bruay, France, when a group
of Fritz planes broke from cloud 100
yards ahead. They were immediately
identified as Richthofen’s famous Circus,
every member a picked fighter pilot.
Cobby bore in and shot down two before
another brace collided into matchwood.
The D.S.O. was collected for low-level
attacks on enemy ’dromes, and, proving
his consistency, he sent five Huns earth-
ward in an 11-days’ series of operations.
All this fiad a direct bearing on the Allies
winning back air supremacy at the time.
After the whistle blew Cobby became
controller of operations for the civil avia-
tion board, and had to face the biggest
barrage of questions at the Kyeema
plane disaster inquiry in 1938. The
second outbreak found him direc-
tor of air recruiting—the R.A.A.F. could
hardly have picked a better man. In
1942 he was A.O.C. north-eastern com-
A. H. COBBY, flier.
mand, with No. 9 operational group in
his orbit, flying from Moresby and Milne
Bay, The next year he was in a Catalina
which crashed near Townsville. One of
the plane’s depth-charges exploded.
Cobby, though injured, , dived three times
down into the ribboned hull to rescue
members of his staff; for this, the George
Medal. He was an air-commodore when
the whistle blew. .
Most visiting Welshmen sooner or later

timber. One of the most depressing
sights to a timberman is ringbarking, and
Gardner saw more than enough of it on
his inspection of N.S.W. forests. Even
so, there was plenty of what he wants —
redgum, tallowwood and blackbutt —
and he hopes to send an initial shipment
of 100,000 super, feet home shortly.
Apropos a recent report that the new
House of Commons will be floored with
Queensland walnut, Gardner revealed that
all the panelling of Swansea’s Guild Hall
is of the same lovely wood.
Scholarships seem to come as a matter
of course to 19-year-old Anthony Jose,
South Australia’s Rhodes scholar for
1949 —he won nine of ’em at St. Peters
College prior to taking a medical course
at Adelaide Uni. An all-round athlete,
and member of S.A.’s Sheffield Shield
team for 1947-48, he’s a grandson of
Canon Jose, Dean of Adelaide, and is the
younger son of Dr. Gilbert Jose, who
died in Malaya while serving with the
10th A.G.H.
With our new carrier Sydney named
and turned over to the R.A.N., the air
station at Nowra, N.S.W., is buzzing with
preparations to receive her. Driving
force behind the activity is Commander
Rodney (naturally called “Dusty”)
Rhoades, D.S.C., executive officer of the
station. A small-ship man, Rhoades had
destroyer Vendetta in the Scrap-iron
Flotilla, With the hard steaming, constant
attacks and miraculous escapes that that
implies, before transhipping to destroyer
Quickraatch, with much the same job.
After the Japs downed arms fie was given
command of our First Frigate Flotilla, in
frigate Shoalhaven, and sailed her mainly
in New Guinea waters before coming
ashore for a spell. Tall and sartorially
immaculate, Rhoades combined the prac-
tised seamanship of the real article with
the appearance of the celluloid conception
of a Navy captain, and sported one of
the best-looking face-fungi in the Service.
Dropped out at the 75th milestone,
Frank Penfold Hyland, Penfold’s govern-
ing-director in Sydney. Acknowledged
by the top men in the industry, many of
whom learnt their “nosing” under him, as
without equal in his sphere, Hyland was
mainly responsible for extending his
firm’s Adelaide interests to N.S.W. The
discrimination of his palate was uncanny.
A merchant once tried to sell him a
mediocre wine. Hyland rejected it.
Twelve months later the cove again
offered the juice, this time camouflaged,
as he hoped, by rendering with another
wine. The expert sipped it and instructed
his office boy: “Tell him he’s wasting
his time —I tried this wine last year.”
W. A. Boxford, relaxing here from
London on a post-retirement tour, de-
scribed the film “Lloyd’s of London” as an
interesting piece of Hollywood fiction. He
should know —he joined the old organisa-
tion 43 years ago, and was secretary to
Lloyd’s committee when he called it a
day. As is generally known, the famous
old Lutine bell, salvaged from a British
warship wrecked off the Dutch coast in
the Napoleonic wars, is rung to herald a
maritime disaster. But Boxford adds that
it also tolls for good news —one stroke for
good, two for bad. The single toll
gave to shipping men the news of
the Graf Spec and Bismarck sink-
ings. A one-time editor of “Lloyd’s
Shipping Register,” which, founded
in 1734, rates next to the London
“Gazette” as Britain’s oldest paper, Box-
ford offered other first-hand information
on the historic building in Leadenhall-
street. It’s the third-largest in London—
St. Paul’s and the Bank of England beat
it—it was miraculously spared in the
blitz, when all around was levelled, and
its huge underwriting-room, where the
world’s insurance risks are accepted, is
furnished with the same style of coffee-
house stalls as those from which Edward
Lloyd gave out his shipping intelligence
in 1688.
“F.S.”: Paris isn’t likely to be knocked
endways by the forthcoming exhibition
of Melbourne artist Sidney Nolan’s
studies of Ned Kelly; in fact, Mr.
Nolan’s Muse will probably be re-
garded as hopelfessly old-fashioned and
Clive Turnbull’s broadcast announcement
that the show is “the most significant held
in Australia for many year's” will doubt-
less raise a polite laugh. Every young
dauber was doing that sort of thing 30
years ago when 1 was in Paris, and the
only impression given will be that it must
take a long time for art magazines to
reach Australia. John Reed is sponsor-
ing the exhibition. He was one of the
co-editors of “Angry Penguins” who “dis-
covered” that immortal poet Ern Malley.
It is a pity Mr. Reed can’t take Ern
along—that hoax would certainly have
amused Paris.
Adam Boyd, whose name was as
widely known among mining men as his
ability was respected, has passed on in
Brisbane at 82. Born in Scotland,
where he got his early experience, he
came here in 1891 and had a spell at New-
castle before shifting to Broken Hill six
years later. His work thebe, both by
the advanced engineering methods he
used and the force of an intense person-
ality, is generally accepted as
for those mines starting on the upward
trend to their present efficiency. Boyd
was in Mt, Morgan when its goldmine
went into voluntary liquidation in 1927.
He stayed as the warring spirit in a syndi-
cate formed to arrest the drift, both of
the town to a derelict camp and the mine
to complete sterility. Five years later
town and mine were thriving under the
injection of Boyd’s driving competence,
and it’s no exaggeration to claim the
present flourishing city as his monument.
Into the silence;
In Hollywood, at 85, Sir Charles Aubrey
Smith, stage and screen actor and inter-
national cricket captain. His neat turn of
speech was not confined to stage-lines. The
Bulletin cricket man of 1887 recorded the
English captain as saying, after a N. S. Waler
named Moses had made 109 against his team,
“Pity it was that Pharaoh’s daughter did not
leave that infant among the bulrushes.”
At Wellington (MX.), at 61, Lt.-Col. Paumea
Ferris, M.8.E., a member of the Ngatiporou
tribe and formerly chief officer of the Maori
war-effort organisation. His grandfather was
an English officer who fought in the Maori
wars. Ferris was schooled at the native college
of Te Aute and served in both World Wars.
At Montevideo (Uruguay), James Stewart
Summers, oneHime of Ballarat and latterly
head of the Y.M.C.A. physical department in
South America. He was one of Victoria’s
leading athletes 40 years ago.
In Melbourne, at 73, Herbert Penrose, who
for a generation conducted the Education De-
partment’s relief organisation frbm his Crom-
vfell-street (Collingwood) school. An outsize
in boilers, in which his special soup was
prepared, brought comfort to the area’s poorest
nippers, particularly in depression years. He
extended the movement State-wide, with par-
ticular benefits during Victoria’s bushfire seasons.
In Brisbane, at 74, William Tunley, chairman
of directors of Tunleys Pty., Ltd. A one-time
senator of Queensland University and vice-
president of Brisbane’s Chamber of Commerce,'
he anticipated the Food for Britain Appeal by
40 years. Over that period, assisted by friend*
in meat and shipping companies, he sent ton*
of beef and mutton to feed the poor of London,


Women’s Letters
From Sydney
Two most important men in town last
week were Prince Axel of Denmark and
Santa Claus. The prince, with the charm-
ing manners, was guest-of-honor at a re-
ception given by Danish Consul-General,
Henning Hergel and Mrs. Hergel in their
Edgecliff home. Santa Claus was guest-
of-honor everywhere. Shop windows
were attractive and amusing, and children
of all ages stood to gaze on their delights.
On Christmas Eve David Jones’ had in
their store windows reproductions of Old
Masters depicting the life of Christ.
The shops became more and more
crowded, taxis harder to get and drinks
more and more plentiful. Cocktail-parties
ringed the city from North to South
Head, and perhaps because of the lean
years before, bottles of wine were a
popular Christmas gift; children, too,
sustained almost a surfeit of parties.
Everybody put trouble and world-worry
behind him, forgetting what might come
with the New Year. But this week a
man and his children had a right to
happiness.
At the Tivoli they are half-way through
the Opera season. For most of the audi-
ence the nights have been enthralling.
The listeners have been carried along on
a tide of music great in conception, if
occasionally weak in delivery. But each
opera has distinctly had its throbbing
moments. Last Wednesday night’s
double bill, “Cavalleria Rusticana” and
“Pagliacci,” had most of the women re-
duced to a pulp. The night’s torrid tem-
perature, Santuzza’s emotion, the Easter
Hymn and the Intermezzo formed too
heavy a brew. Enviable was the lady in
the stalls who waved throughout the night
a grass-green ostrich-feather fan and the
wearers of backless and strapless frocks.
One of the prettiest young girls at
Wednesday’s performance was tall and
fair Joyce Bianchi. Her long and full
frock was of white broderie Anglaise over
black taffeta. With her mother she has
been a constant attender. Another first-
nighter who catches the eye is Hazel
Jackson. Her favorite wrap is a short
jacket stiff with rich and jewelled em-
broidery. It came a long time ago out
of Japan. Margaret Salenger decorates
the dress-circle. Mrs. Bertie Kelly, Mrs.
Sep Levy and Mrs. Florence Taylor are
among the admired. Mrs. Lennox Bode,
Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere, the Harry Mox-
ham lady and Mrs. Charles Lloyd Jones
have added rich raiment to many a per-
formance, Knight Ben and Lady Fuller
are always in their accustomed places , so
is Mrs. Hugh Ward. Among the singers
are noticed Strella Wilson, Carrie Lance-
ley and Heather Kinnaird, Mrs. Greg
McGirr is to be seen often surrounded
by members of her family. Dr. Tom
Bateman and Mrs. Bateman were “Caval-
leria” enthusiasts. Her frock of lobelia-
blue satin had the front panel of the full
skirt flower-painted.
Mrs. Cedric O’Gorman Hughes’s
frock —its pale-blues running into deep-
a moonlit.night. Sway-
ing black tulles over black-and-white
taffeta were worn by Mrs. A. Zylstra.
Mrs. Walter Burfitt and daughter Dr.
McNamara never miss a new perform-
ance.
There was a stiff, cold breeze on the
night of the R.S.Y.S. Christmas-party.
It chilled the glow of the red, white and
blue lights strung among the trees’ and
over the lawns, so that anyone, after the
eighth, might have thought them a flash
from Aurora Borealis. Anyway, in spite
of luring chairs in twos and threes with-
out, everyone stayed within. Bunches of
balloons glittered multicolored from ceil-
ing and chandelier; there was a modest
and retiring Christmas-tree in the hall.
There was supper in the billiard-room,
and dancing on the verandah overlooking
Port Jackson. And loose about the whole
place were nearly 300 guests, mostly
members and associates. In the absence
of Commodore J. M. Hardie, Vice-
Commodore D’Arcy Shelley and Mrs.
Shelley received the guests.
Mrs. Fred White, new president of the
associates, was with Mrs. Don Taylor, a
former president for several years. Both
have links with the squadron that
go back to their ’teen-ages. Pretty little
Mrs. Fitzhardinge wore a Parma-violet
frock. Major and Mrs. Manley (her
pearls were worn with a difference,
pendant from a gold necklet). Govern-
ment House’s official secretary, L. A.
Robb, and Mrs. Robb, Mr. and Mrs.
Gandon made merry together. Eye-man
Dr. Gregory Roberts, limping (golf the
cause) just as gracefully as Laurence
Olivier, and Mrs. Roberts brought a
family party. Dr. and Mrs. Wade and
the Charles Towles, from Maoriland, and
Dr. and Mrs. Graham Drew were others
celebrating.
Frances Scully’s Christmas Eve lunch-
party at Romano’s was dedicated to the
ballet. Frances, who is principal of
probably the largest school of ballet in
Sydney, had as guest of honor Ruth
French, who came from London to Aus-
tralia as examiner for the Royal Academy
of Dancing. Miss French is enthusiastic
over Australian ballet students, and she
has now examined them in every State
but Western Australia. As a young girl
Miss French danced in the ,Pavlova com-
pany. If people at neighboring tables had
listened-in they would have heard Ruth
and Kathleen Danetree, who is in this
country also on Royal Academy affairs,
murmuring pianissimo opening bars to
Pavlova’s solo dances, reminding each
other of the costumes Pavlova had worn
and how she had looked in them. Mrs.
French, who is touring Australia with her
daughter (and is just as ballet-minded),
was in the company. So was Tessa Scully,
who stage-managed the party cleverly and
amusingly.
All Victoria Barracks habitues and a
circle of friends spread through every
suburb will miss Colonel Mann and his
wife of the great dark eyes when they
leave Sydney in the New Year. He has
a new military appointment in Melbourne,
and the two go off in January, Mrs.
Mann is a very active worker for the
War Widows’ Guild. Athol Shmith

Among the many Christmas Day
parties, Evie Hayes (alias Annie Get-your-
gun) and husband Will Mahoney held
a come-and-stay-or-come-and-go one.
Doings started at three in the afternoon
and went on till midnight. There were
drinks for the come-and-goers, and a
festive supper for those who stayed. The
Ted Hammersteins were there, and the
Claude Flemmings. Webb Tilton and his
wife dropped in with season’s greetings;
so did the Carl Randells and the Harald
Bowdens. Dr. and Mrs. Hugh Poate, of
Bellevue Hill, struck a new note. They
rang the bell at seven-thirty a.m., and
started the day’s fun and games with a
family breakfast party.
Of all the Christmas greetings this
Letter received none was more welcome
than that from poet Arthur Bayldon, now
a far-from-well man. His handwriting is
at once picturesque and clear—as great a
joy to see as well-modulated, clear diction
is to hear.
Fanny Cohen, principal of Fort-street
Girls’ High, says:
Past and present pupils of Fort-street
School look forward to 1949, for this is
the year of the school’s centenary.
The history of Fort-street School is closely
linked with the early days of the colony.
When Sydney was a small garrison town
the main portion of the building was con-
structed as a military hospital; the date
1815 is deeply cut into the stonework over
the main entrance. In 1844 a movement
for national education began, a Board of
Control was established and in 1849 it
acquired the military hospital for educa-
tional purposes. In it the Fort-street
Model School made its home. In 1911
the model school became a high school,
housing both boys and girls; in 1915 a
new boys’ high school was built at Fort-
street, Petersham. Today the historic old
building is the home of Fort-street Girls’
High School.
A pageant, in which present pupils will
take part, will be held at the Conserva-
torium ; a garden-party at which the prin-
cipal will be official hostess will be held
at the old school; a dinner at the Went-
worth Hotel and finally a ball at the
Trocadero are included in the celebra-
tions planned for April-May.
“There is a divinity doth shape our
ends ” Hugh Beresford, the Queen’s
milliner, is due to make his bow to
Sydney after Christmas. He will display
his autumn collection in the showroom
of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and cards
are out for a tea-party on January 24.
The workmanship in these hats will be a
point worth regarding —also the prices.
You can leave it to the Navy! The
other morning as the tram from Circular
Quay curved into George-street, the driver
saw a small and bewildered pigeon on
the lines. It was too young to have
developed the hardy insouciance of the
old-established Quay pigeon, and it was
paralysed with fright. The driver slowed
his tram and a young sailor, passing,
rushed over from the footpath, lifted the
bird gently, carried it to safety and spoke
it fair, till presently it regained its con-
fidence, spread its wings and flew off.
For 25 years the staff of Grace Brothers
has been presenting sizeable cheques to
the city’s charities. This year, all told,
the men and girls of the big Broadway
store had £4480 to distribute. The Royal
Alexandra Hospital for Children scored
highest, getting £l5OO of the swag. Mrs.
I. Grace handed out the cheques to repre-
sentatives of the charities at the Grace
Brothers’ auditorium. Altogether eight
good works are better off.
A friend just back from New York has
among prized possessions against summer
evenings a full-length, slightly-fitting fine
wool coat. It is cut rounded to the neck-
line, and is buttoned down the front to
about waist-level. On each side there is
a smart little patch-pocket, and the whole
thing is in tomato-red. What could be a
brighter offset to the dull-surfaced
woollens, especially those with the finish
of linens which have shooed the novelty
weaves and printed designs out of the
fashion-parade? White in the finest of
wool jersey is in the news for summer
evening frocks. If you believe yourself to
have the figure of a goddess you’ll wear
this draped in the Grecian manner. If
you have any doubts about your contour,
best leave the style to the dressmaker.
Yellow and almond-green will be popular
summer colors. But aren’t they always?
From Melbourne
Over 300,000 people, including Sir
Winston and Lady Dugan and the Lord
Mayor, Cr. J. S. Disney, and Mrs. Disney
attended the Carols by Candlelight festival
on Christmas Eve at the Alexandra
Gardens. The midnight mass at St.
Patrick’s Cathedral and the carol service
at St. Paul’s attracted capacity congrega-
tions, reflecting the resurgence of faith
which the Great Anniversary brings each
year. Among the many Christmas-cards
which this Letter gratefully acknowledges
were those from the Lord Mayor and
Lady Mayoress, which bore the coat-of-
arms of the city on the cover; one from
the R.A.A.F., showing No. 10 Squadron
in action in the Bay of Biscay, June,
1940; from the Gallipoli Legion of
Anzacs, the colorful badge of the legion
adorning the front-page; one from the
L. J. McConnans and daughter Bunty ;
which bore a reproduction of “Golden
Summer” by David Davies and was re-
produced by courtesy of the National
Gallery Trustees of Victoria.
Denise Porritt, chosen “Miss Victoria”
for 1948, is a blonde with shoulder-
length hair, wide grey-blue eyes and
an attractive figure. Denise has done
modelling since she left Korowa C. of E.
Girls’ Grammar School, and for a short
period was a receptionist at Chevron.
A lover of the outdoor life, she is now
busy gathering together the £4OO ward-
robe which was the donation of various
fashion firms to the State winner. Denise
will compete for the “Miss Australia”
finals in Sydney next month. A John
Warlow photo.
Guests of the Legacy Club, about 1500
children of dead servicemen crowded the
lawns of. Government 9 House for the
largest party for children ever given in
Australia. Sir Winston Dugan welcomed
the children, who had come from all parts
of the State. Each child received a party
cap, a bag of toys, sweets and afternoon
tea. There were pony rides, merry-go-
rounds, a Punch-and-Judy show. During
the afternoon boys and girls who attend
the Legacy Club centre gave demonstra-
tions of physical training. So thorough
does Legacy do its work that even at the
party medicoes, dentists, legal advisers
and education officers were on hand
making appointments for mothers to
bring their children for attention. Over
3000 toys distributed had been made by
pupils of schools and technical colleges.
One of the big pre-Christmas parties
was that for the children at Claridge’s.
Tinies in pretty party frocks danced with
dad, while small sons trod a measure with
their mothers. The clowns were ap-
plauded lustily, and after carols were sung
Father Christmas appeared. Mrs. Con-
stance Day was there with her son
Neville and daughter Deanna. Mrs.
Claudia Creswick and Mrs. John Quere
brought small parties of children ; the
Bill Ryans brought their little girls. Betty
O’Connor brought her small son and
daughter; the Phil Actons and Mrs.
Charles Lane came with their children.
Young Robin Walters, who wore a vieux-
rose moire taffeta ballerina frock, leaves
in the Strathaird for England with her
mother on January 15 to study dramatic
art. *
Wearing a jacket suit of Chartreuse
lightweight wool with a large black hat
and accessories, the Lady Mayoress, Mrs.
J. S. Disney, held a “drop-in” party in her
reception-room at the Town Hall on
Christmas Eve. Among guests were Mrs.
A. L. Walters in a black sheer frock and
wide-brimmed upswept hat of primrose
straw ; Mrs. Margaret Saker, whose aqua-
blue jacket-suit was worn with white hat
and accessories ; Mrs. R. H. Solly, who
allied dusty-pink self-embroidered jacket
suit and wide-brimmed black hat; her
daughters Eileen, in upturned white hat
and tropical-flower-printed frock, and
Noelle, in pink-and-mauve-printed silks;
Jean Belson, whose white silk frock was
printed with pale-tinted autumn flowers;
Mrs. A. L. Morton, a small hat matching
her black ensemble ; Mrs. Fred Hardy, in
green and black prints ; daughter Margot,
whose cbtton frock in deep and light
orange tones had alternate bands of white
in the pattern; and Mrs. H. Barry
Thomson, who set off a saxe-blue floral
frock with a large black straw hat.
Mrs. H. Barry Thomson gave her 38th
annual Christmas party in the beautifully-
decorated children’s ward at the Alfred
Hospital. Among the many wonderful
presents handed to the 40 children by
Father Christmas from a big tree were
jackets which had been lovingly hand-
worked by members of the hospital
auxiliaries. Mrs. Barry Thomson had
hoped that her son Jack would arrive
from America with his wife, former film
star Ruth Chatterton, in time for the
party, but stage engagements precluded
this. It is many years since Jack left Aus-
tralia, but the Christmas party given each
year at the Alfred Hospital is the result
of a promise made to Jack by Mrs. Barry
Thomson when he was a little boy, and
it has been faithfully carried out all
these years.
Eighty guests were entertained at a
late-afternoon farewell party by Mr. and
Mrs. Leslie J. Sangster at the Occidental
Hotel prior to their departure for Eng-
land in the Orcades. The hostess wore
an ice-blue suit with London-tan and
white accessories. Mrs. W, McDermott
contrasted her black frock with a large
off-the-face white hat which had a rolled
brim of black-and-white-striped taffeta.
Mrs. W. Plowright’s black sheer frock
had the square neckline and full, short
sleeves ; her wide-brimmed hat was of
fine black straw. Lime-green hat and
black frock made tasteful combination
for Mrs. E. Watts, Mrs. Leigh Crow
mixed black and turquoise in the hat
which topped her black ensemble. Mrs.
Robert Tingey, sister of the hostess, was
with her husband, Major Tingey—they
are both recent arrivals from England,
The engagement has been announced
of Betty, younger daughter of the Bruce
Holdsworths, of Upper Hawthorn, to
Nevin, eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. Hedley
Vawser, of Adelaide. Betty, who got
her B.A. degree from Melbourne Uni.
this year, will, in the coming year, take
up the post of senior history mistress at
Fiona Girls’ School. Nevin is an en-
gineering graduate of Adelaide Uni.
After their marriage the couple hope to
do post-graduate courses in England in
their respective professions.
The famous “blue horse” of Elizabeth
Arden was featured in the floral decora-
tions for the dinner which her deputy,
Dorothea Ganley, gave to the staff and to
women scribes. To each guest was given
a tiny bottle of blue-grass perfume and a
linen hanky. The roast-chicken came to
the table under the spreading wings of an
illuminated model hen, and marzipan
sweets rested in a tall basket of sun-
sugar. A wide-brimmed black hat was
worn by the hostess with her black-and-
white-printed silk frock. Mamie Hall’s
black crepe frock had a swathed hipline,
while the bodice had touches of pale-
pink ; satin ribbon trimmed her black hat.
Mrs. J. Garrard’s pastel-pink flower-
trimmed hat was worn with a black frock.
Mary Coles, Isobel Kennedy, Pat Jarrett
and Mrs. Ivor Mclnnes were*among the
many who were at the festive board.

A disappointing result. Once a high- and
then medium-grade producer, the co. is
now faced with a large tonnage of low-
grade ore that can be treated profitably
only by large-scale throughput, and by
judicious handling of overburden and ore.
The plan for treatment of bigger ton-
nage fell behind schedule, owing to delays
connected with delivery and installation of
a new 84in. x 60in. primary jaw crusher
and ancillary equipment, which didn’t get
into full swing until August last. And
installation of the 10ft. x 7ft. ball-mill
and 21ft. bowl-classifier, on hand a year
ago, didn’t begin until toward the close
of accounts, when skilled labor from the
crusher became available.
There was little change in the overall
labor position. Still, an extra 80,293 tons,
making 1,897,423 tons in all (96.3 p.c, of
all material handled), was taken from the
West Lyell opencut. The trouble was
that only 1,249,179 tons (down 121,189
tons) was ore, the other 648,244 tons (up
201,482 tons) being waste. And the ore
was of slightly lower grade.
One result was a smaller outturn of
copper and other metals, as the following
comparison of treatment and recovery
figures shows:

Mill tailings yielded 52,131 tons pyritic
concentrates, assaying 49.2 p.c. sulphur,
but shipping difficulties restricted de-
liveries to consumers. Also, inadequate
coke supplies hampered smelting, and
shortage of steel balls in the fine-grind-
ing section reduced copper output by
nearly five tons a week.
However, gross income from copper,
etc., stepped up £57,383, thanks to lifts
in the official buying price—the figure for
electrolytic rose from £l3O a ton at the
beginning of the term to £l4O a't March
1 and to £l6O from June 28. There was
no change in the return from invest-
ments: —

Wage-lifts and the rising price of stores,
etc., bumped up mining, smelting and re-
fining charges by £88,702, which was only
partly offset by savings of £19,316 in ad-
ministrative and other exes. In addition
£33,846 was spent on removal of over-
burden and charged to capital, raising the
overburden account to £50,027.
In the introductory table depreciation,
etc., is included with profit and then
shown as written off. Allowing for minor
adjustments, the net profit claimed was
£105,835 (down £11,989), or 6.8 p.c. on
the £1,550,000 of capital as against 7.6,
0.8 and 0.2 p.c. for the three preceding
terms. Disregarding the cost of income
from investments, mining showed a profit
of only £18,833 (down £12,003). The
div. was kept at 5 p.c., and it is doubtful
whether better need be anticipated for a
while.
The new crusher is expected to increase
concentrate production by over 7000 tons
p.a., and better delivery of pyrites to the
mainland is promised. The output of
metallic copper, however, will be gov-
erned partly by deliveries of coke. Costs
are still climbing, and many factors that
contributed to last term’s low output are
likely to continue for a year or more.
Meanwhile the co. has asked for another
lift in the buying-price of copper—red
metal is being imported at cost of £lBO a
ton.
There was a slip of £11,799 in the net

(called to 7s. 6d, each when the books
closed) in Metal Manufacturers, which
paid 10 p.c. in its last term. Other hold-
ings are principally in fertiliser concerns.
The overdraft (£589,196) increased by
£63,465. The mine stood at £520,551 (un-
altered), and freehold, plant, railway, etc.,
totalled £807,527 (up £6288).
The market prices the ords. at 265. 6d.
(365. 6d. a year ago), thus valuing the
undertaking at £2,053,750, or £20,097
less than the more-or-less liquid surplus.
The return at 265. 6d. is 3.7 p.c. on a
5 p.c. div. basis, or 4.5 p.c. should the
distribution rise to 6 p.c.

The figures prior to 1947 aren’t of
much interest now, the co. having sold
its telecommunication assets and business
to the Government in October, 1946.
Private shareholders did well out of the
deal. The price was £1,400,000 (cash),
of which £1,120,828 was for goodwill
and £279,172 for physical assets. That
was for the interests of shareholders
other than the Government, which itself
held, and still holds, p.c. of the co.’s
paid capital. For each original £1 share,
worth 725. in the market in October,
1946, private shareholders received
575. 7d. in cash, plus one f.-p. Bs. 6d.
share, now priced at 375. 6d., with a
new share issue in prospect, of which
more will be said presently.
Production now falls under four
main headings: (1) User goods—
broadcast - receivers, amplifiers, public-
address systems, etc.; (2) engineering
lines broadcast transmitters, radar,
F.M. modulation apparatus, industrial
aids, etc.; (3) specialised lines —road-
traffic signals, telephones, navigation in-
struments, etc.; and (4) components for
other manufacturers. The co. also
operates broadcasting stations at Syd-
ney, Goulburn, Grafton, Townsville,
Cairns, Warwick, Albury and Bendigo,
provides technical services for other
broadcasting cos., holds some 3000
patents covering radio, radar and tele-
vision and is interested in seven sub-
sidiary and associated cos.
There was an all-round growth in
turnover last term. Gross earnings
(£757,601) showed no change worth
mentioning; that was because the 1947
figure included three months’ takings
from 'telecommunication services. In-
cluding unspecified provisions for taxa-
tion and contingencies, exes. (£667,023)
were £7631 lighter. The net result
(£90,578, up £7619) was 21.6 p.c. on
capital as against 19.8 p.c. for the
previous term. The div. was lifted from
8 p.c. to 10 p.c., and the £40,317 That
remained raised reserves, less £85,811 of
intangibles, £347,105 higher than paid
capital. On the two combined the year’s
profit was a moderate 7.4 p.c.
Expansion of the co.’s wireless ser-
vices and manufacturing activities is
further reflected in balance-sheet figures:,

To meet net additions of £35,507 to plant,
£219,138 to stocks, £23,525 to sharehold-
ings and £189,274 to book debts the co.
leant upon sundry creditors, etc., for an
extra £397,590. When the books closed
there was 15s. Bd. of outside money at
risk in the business for every pound be-
longing to shareholders, excluding the
depreciation reserve (£739,743).
To ease the debt and provide for
further expansion, 779,188 new Bs. 6d.
shares are to be offered at a date and
on terms yet to be announced. When
fully paid the issue will lift paid capital
to £750,000, on which 12 p.c. will call
for £90,000, or £758 less profit than
claimed last term.
Demand for most of the co.’s major
products and services looks like being a
continuing and increasing one, for a
while at any rate. The Government is
one of the co.’s biggest customers; and
a 60k.w. broadcasting transmitter is now
being turned out for export. Price and
other considerations seem likely to keep
F.M, broadcasting in the background.
Television offers prospects, but for tech-
nical and financial reasons its develop-
ment is likely to be slow.
At 375. 6d, the scrip gives an immedi-
ate return of 2.7 p.c. on a 12 p.c. div.
basis. Assuming the new issue—it
stands as 79 to 100 in relation to pre-
sent capital—is made at a premium of
100 p.c,, the net price, after exercising
the rights, would be 28s. Bd., or 265. 9d.
if the premium was 50 p.c. The return at
the two last-mentioned prices would be
respectively 3.5 p.c. and 3.8 p.c. on a
12 p.c. div. basis.

The co. does a large trade —-much of it.
on a t.-p. basis —in drapery, clothing,
furniture, furnishings, crockery, sporting-
goods, etc. Headquarters are at Central-
square (Sydney), and there are branches
at Newcastle, Wollongong and Dubbo.
It also owns the £lOO,OOO of ord. capital
in Bon Marche, drapers (Sydney), and
over two-thirds of the £105,000 of ord.
capital in Miller Anderson, drapers
(Adelaide), After going hungry for 16
years, the ords. in Bon Marche received
5 p.c. for each of the last three years ;
Miller Anderson’s scrip has returned a
steady 6 p.c. since purchase (at par) about
five years ago.
Last term the co. shared in the general
experience, all sections contributing to the
increased turnover, which ran ahead of
advancing costs. After providing- for
taxation and allowing £6521 (down
for depreciation, shown as written oft in
the table, the amount available for share-
holders was £83,762 (up £5803), best in
the co.’s history. After paying pref. divs.
(together £37,360), enough remained to
show 11.4 p.c. on the £404,938 of ord.
capital compared with 10, 8.8, 6.1, 4.5,
3 3 and 4.1 p.c. back to 1942. The div.
was kept at 6 p.c., and no harm will be
done if it remains there until reserves
(now £69,463 in excess of goodwill) pro-
vide a stouter prop for the £1,002,786 ot
paid capital. The £5711 of capital profit
shown in the table came from sale of two
small surplus properties.
The expected fillip to trade from the
Royal visit will not materialise. But
retail turnovers are still expanding, and
they are likely to remain at a high level
while export income is inflated. Still,
buyers are becoming more discriminating
and credit is beginning to figure more
prominently in sales; this despite re-
current wage-lifts, which are an element
of costs as well as buying-power—in the
long run costs usually win the race to the
detriment of trade generally and the
standard of living.
With its own funds, and more besides,
represented by freeholds, plant, stocks and
shareholdings, the co. has had to borrow
heavily to carry a half-million-odd of
book debts:

Tutt Bryant, Ltd. ,
First listed on Sydney ’Change last
July, after 10 highly successful years as a
distributor and maker of constructional
engineering equipment, Tutt Bryant is
now in process of doubling its paid capi-
tal. When L. E. Tptt and G. E. Bryant
began the business in December, 1938,
capital was £2OOO. On conversion to a
proprietary company five years later the
figure was £12,000, and it reached
£40,000 in 1946-47. Earnings for the four
years as a proprietary were as follows
(figures in the last line being subject to
private-company tax):

The chairman estimates that net profits
after paying taxes on a public-company

would have been £21,404, £23,278 and
£37,336 —a very satisfactory earning
rate on capital.
Conversion to a public co. last June
was the occasion for a considerable
writing-up of capital. By that time the pro-
prietary’s capital was evidently £42,700,

FELT & TEXTILES
OF AUSTRALIA LTD.
Chairman's Address, 9th December, 1948.
In commenting on the year’s results I am referring, as usual, to the
Consolidated Accounts, and not to those of the Parent Company, unless
otherwise stated.
The Net Profit of the Company and Subsidiaries for the year ended 30th
June, 1948, was £374,310, after providing:
(1) £328,830 for Depreciation, including Special Depreciation,
£147,268 and—
(3) £530,940 for Taxation,
£819,760
The corresponding figures for the year ended 30th June, 1947, were;
Profit £301,953 after providing:
(1) £334,339 for Depreciation and
(3) £394,135 for Taxation
£548,374
I As you will have noted, out of the
profits of the year your Directors
have added £50,000 to the General
Deserve. The sum of £30,000, which
was overprovided for taxation last
year, has been transferred to the
Special Reserve, making it £80,000.
This Reserve was created some years
ago to meet any emergency which
might conceivably arise in a business
such as ours.
The Directors’ report has already
drawn attention to the fact that, be-
fore striking a net profit for the
whole of the Company’s operations
for the year, the sum of £160,000 has
been especially reserved as a pre-
cautionary measure in view of the
present high prices of wool and other
raw materials. Taxation has, of
course, been paid on this sum. To-
gether with the Special Reserve to
which I have already referred, wo
have provided, in all, a sum of
£240,000 as an insurance against the
future.
A circumstance which made a
material contribution to the favour-
able nature of the operations of the
year’s accounts we are reviewing was
the favourable condition of the Ex-
port Trade. Whilst we entertain no
fears as to the soundness of the well-
established firms with whom we do
our export business, I think we can-
not anticipate that the profits arising
from our overseas Trading Opera-
tions will continue to be as substan-
tial in the future as they have been
during the year under review, which
materially assisted the Company in
making the liberal provision for the
future, to which I have referred.
There may be in your minds some
doubt about the large amount of
money it is proposed to set aside for
taxation. I have already explained
one of the main causes in the reten-
tion of £160,000, and the figures also
include our New Zealand subsidiaries,
where the incidence of Company tax-
ation differs from that current in
Australia. The New Zealand Com-
pany Tax, in our case, amounts to
11/6 in the pound, but the share-
holders are not then subject to
further taxation, except insofar as
Dividends received are taken into
account in determining the rate of
tax on other income. These, plus Un-
distributed Profit Tax and some other
taxation provisions of a minor nature,
have, in the aggregate, been the cause
of the very heavy taxation reserves
it was thought desirable to make.
SOUND POSITION OF 3RD
PREFERENCE SHARES.
It will probably be of interest to
shareholders, particularly holders of
Third Preference Issues, to compare
the profits cover and assets backing
with the figures claimed in the Pros-
pectus issued in respect of that issue.
Therein, it was stated that the aver-
age profits for a period of five years
provided dividend cover of 4.81
times. In the accounts I am now
reviewing it will be seen that the
cover is a little over seven (7)
times. The assets backing was
quoted as £3/1/6 per share, whilst in
the Balance Sheet now before you
the cover for the Third Preference
Shares is £4 per share. From this,
it will be seen that, owing to the
small amount of First and
Second Preference Shares (in the
aggregate £240,000) and their con-
sequently small call on the profits,
the Third Preference Shares have
as good a net asset and dividend
cover as First Preference Shares in
many other Companies.
PRODUCTION AND TURNOVER.
FOOTWEAR: There has been a
greater volume of supplies available
during the year compared with the
years immediately preceding, and in
certain of the cheaper types of foot-
wear there is no longer any scar-
city. In the case of branded lines
and those with well-established
reputations, there is usually some
degree of shortage and in some cases
it is still very acute. Considerable
time must elapse before this can
be completely remedied, the main
factors being the shortage in
leather of high enough quality, and
of skilled work-people. The latter
shortage is pronounced in the cities.
We have met the latter condition by
extending into country areas where
possible. As I have recorded in
previous addresses to you, this
policy has been met with conspicu-
ous success.
In Victoria we have increased sub-
stantially our activities in Geelong
and Mildura, having transferred
plant and equipment from Mel-
bourne.
DECENTKAEISED PLANTS
SATISFACTORY.
In New South Wales we have
added to the Wiugham Factory and
have substantially increased equip-
ment and staff at Woy Woy. We
have found our extension into
country areas very satisfactory, and
are of the opinion that, besides the
aspect of production, the economic
and social conditions of our em-
ployees can be dealt with on a more
satisfactory basis and raised to a
higher level.
We have spent considerable sums
in studying the methods employed
overseas by sending footwear ex-
ecutives to other pai’ts of the world,
and this policy is productive of far-
reaching benefits.
FELT: Although we have in-
creased our aggregate production of
floor Felt during the year, we have
not yet been able to reach the point
where our customers are adequately
supplied. The conditions to which
I referred in my last address to you
still exist, but we have made some
progress and during the current
year we hope our plans will be
sufficiently advanced to enable us to
adequately meet this position. In
N.S.W. we have secured a new and
yery extensive factory site. Early
in the new year we expect to be
able to proceed with the erection of
the new mill, together with a small
housing scheme. The district in
which the new mill will be situated
is a very progressive one, in elevated
open country. The plant has been
on order for some time, and suffi-
cient will be available before the
completion of the building to enable
us to set down there and start up a
complete economic unit. This move
will also enable us to increase .Hair
Felt production, which is a neces-
sary corollary of the greater produc-
tion of woollen floor Felt.
We have been engaged in the
preliminary steps to produce new
varieties of floor Felt, which we
think will be an attractive addition
to the floor Felt trade, but at
present these efforts are hampered
by lack of space.
SPINNING, WEAVING AND
CLOTHING MANUFACTURE.
These plants have been consider-
ably added to during the year. A
substantial portion of our spinning
and weaving production goes into
our own clothing factories, whose
output has been much greater hith-
erto, although here again we have
not yet been able to fully satisfy
all our customers. The withdrawal
of the wool subsidy in these indus-
tries will have a very material effect
on prices, as all woollen clothes will
be much dearer as soon as stocks of
subsidised wool are exhausted.
The Adelaide Clothing Factory,
which is an acquisition of recent
years, has developed very well during
the year, and is turning out men’s
suits of a high standard of quality
on the multi-fitting principle. There
seems little doubt, owing to the very
high cost of made-to-measure
tailored suits, that, not only has
the multi-fitting suit come to stay,
but that it also has an assured
future in front of it. We hope to
develop this type of business still
further in the future.
Some time ago the Company
bought a considerable area of land
situated at Tottenham, to the north-
west of Melbourne. The purpose of
this acquisition was to give us room
to erect buildings in which some of
our subsidiaries would find room for
expansion in a grouped area, shar-
ing, where practicable, common facili-
ties. The Companies to be accom-
modated in this way at present com-
prise British Australian Carpet
Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Scapa
Dryers (Aust.) Pty., Ltd., and the
finishing section of Daylesford
Woollen and Worsted Mills Pty.,
Ltd.
As you will recall, your Company
holds a three-quarter interest in
British Australian Carpet Manufac-
turing Co., Ltd., the balance of the
shares being held by the Carpet
Manufacturing Co., Ltd., of England.
The B.A.C.M. has taken over a sec-
tion of the area mentioned and has
erected a modern factory building
with provision for further expansion.
The Capital of Scapa Dryers
(Aust.) Pty., Ltd., is wholly owned
by your Company, but in this ven-
ture we are associated with Scapa
Dryers, Ltd., of England. The Aus-
tralian Company will eventually be
engaged in the production of heavy
woollen Pelts required for the opera-
tion of machinery in paper mills. A
commencement has been made of the
building for Scapa Dryers, .and the
plant is being got together for us
by our associated Company in Eng-
land. .Great obstacles have had to
be overcome in introducing this in-
dustry to Australia, since before the
war many of the machines required
were only obtainable from Germany.
However, the Directors consider that
satisfactory progress has been made.
A building has also been com-
menced for the finishing section of
Daylesford Woollen and W.orsted
Mills. When this has been completed
and additional plant has been in-
stalled in this mill, it will be pos-
sible for our Daylesford Subsidiary
to increase its production, not only
in quantity but in a variety of
cloths.
You will have noted in the Balance
Sheet and Reports now before you
that there has been an Increase in
Ordinary Capital of 105,000 shares
since the date of the Balance Sheet.
This issue was made to acquire the
whole of the Shares in David Galt
Pty., Limited, an old-established
company in Victoria, with an exten-
sive business in the manufacture of
flock, wadding and kindred products.
The Board is very pleased with this
acquisition, which, besides being a
very profitable business in itself, fits
in admirably with our operations
and will strengthen our position in
various directions.
WOOL: Last year the Common-
wealth Wool Clip realised a record
total amount of £155,547,893, com-
pared with the previous highest
figure of £92,335,940 for the 1946-47
clip, an addition to the National In-
come of £63,211,953. At the moment
it would appear that the total real-
ised for Australia’s Wool Clip this
year will exceed the record for 1947-
48. Such figures fully support the
belief that there is still an unsatis-
fied demand for wool throughout the
world.
Our Wool Companies have achieved
most gratifying results. The aggre-
gate production output has further
increased on last year. Your Com-
pany has the advantage of possess-
ing a Sales Organisation throughout
the world, which is available to con-
sumers of our standardised products.
I wish to advise shareholders of a
further very important extension in
our Wool activities —I refer to the
acquisition of the South Australian
Scouring and Carbonising Works of
J. W. McGregor & Sons, Ltd., of
Adelaide.
Although considerable increases in
local costs of aids to manufacture
and labour expenses are taking place,
the position of our Wool Companies
should continue to be entirely sound,
and profitable results a feature of
their continuous development. De-
mands for our products are so great
that consumers overseas are pre-
pared to place their orders for de-
liveries several months ahead of the
capacity of our plants.
Our Wool Scouring and Carbonis-
ing Companies provided all the
necessary raw material required by
our Felt Manufacturing, Spinning
and Weaving Mill. In addition we
were called upon to supply fine
Merino Wool products for use by
Felt & Textiles of New Zealand,
Ltd., where such fine wools are not
produced. Felt & Textiles of South
Africa, Ltd., were also provided with
special Australian Wool Types as
required by them.
INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS AND
PRICKS.
Although industrial conditions
generally continue to be difficult,
with many frivolous and unnecessary
stoppages, I am pleased to be able
to record our own activities have
been carried out with very little dis-
turbance and no major dislocation
of any kind. We have, of course,
been affected, in common with our
competitors and other industrialists,
by shortage in skilled staff and
vital materials, but, even in this, we
have enjoyed distinct advantages in
having our production widely spread
with self-contained units in different
and suitable centres. So constituted,
a much greater responsibility is
thrown on the central management,
but we have been able to meet this
special problem of control by a care-
fully evolved system,, including a
closely-knit form of financial con-
trol, which enables us to supervise
and direct our various and widely-
spread interests.
Though it was not to be supposed
that the system of subsidies on raw
materials could be maintained indefi-
nitely, the sudden removal of wool
subsidies, at the very moment when
world’s prices took an abnormal leap
upwards, was of doubtful wisdom.
In view of the effects on our eco-
nomy, arising out of the system of
price control, it would probably have
been far better to have allowed local
prices to rise somewhat and reduced
the subsidy on wool. The difficulties
and anomalies arising out of the
cancellation of the subsidies will, of
course, be temporary and will be
overcome as time goes on. A steep
rise in the price of all garments and
other produce made from wool is in-
evitable once supplies of all subsi-
dised wool are exhausted. Price con-
trol has now passed to the States,
and it remains to be seen how this
system will -work, and whether it
will make for more rapid decisions,
which in the present case of new
prices for Woollen goods on unsub-
sidised wool are claimant.
PRICK FIXERS MUST ALLOW
FOR RKSKRVKS.
I want to say something else, too,
in this regard. No one anticipates
wool prices will remain at their
present levels indefinitely. With the
large measure of inflation that has
taken place, arising out of war
finance, the value of money has per-
manently fallen, and it is improb-
able that we will see pre-war prices
for wool any more, or for that
matter for anything else, unless very
large surpluses of primary products
arise and a glut occurs. It is essen-
tial that, if we are not to sow
the seeds of great danger to our
economy later on, the price-fixing
authority should see that ample pro-
vision is alloAved for reserves. This
is especially necessary for companies
dealing in commodities which are
liable to rapid downward fluctua-
tions in price. Companies must buy
their raw materials in the market at
the current prices, be they high or
low. They can only provide reserves
out of current sales made at a price
which enables them to provide for
the reserves. That is the job of
business prudence and wisdom.
Mere accountancy cannot be a sub-
stitute. If the price-fixing authori-
ties are unable to recognise that
there is a future, as well as a past
and a present, the day of reckoning
will inevitably come and theirs will
very largely be the responsibility for
what happens thereafter. This is
especially true of a period when
world conditions have created a situ-
ation when prices have reached an
abnormally high level. Your com-
pany is taking care of that situation
so far as it can and will continue to
do so if the price-fixing authorities
so permit.
THEORKTICAL IDEAS CAUSE
CONFUSION.
I can only repeat here what I,have
said elsewhere, that the whole Aus-
tralian economy, under the hybrid
system of control which the Gov-
ernment has allowed to develop, is
getting info inextricable confusion.
Our chief producer of national in-
come, wool, is being, and has been
ever since the ILK. purchase came
to an end, sold, so far as the pro-
ducer is concerned, at world’s parity,
both in Australia and to the world,
whilst in regard to other things you
have prices fixed in Australia dis-
playing every conceivable variation,
from prices apparently pulled out of
a hat and fixed arbitrarily to pre-
war prices. I do not think that the
theoretical economists, whose advice
the Governments have presumably
followed, have the remotest idea of
the Inequalities they are creating or
the confusion which, in my Judg-
ment, must ultimately arise when
all these artificial controls disappear,
as some day they presumably must.
in exchange for which its share-
holders have been allotted
150.000 fully-paid £1 ordinary
shares in the new concern ; and
30.000 of these have been sold
to the public to provide the
spread needed for ’Change list-
ing.
% Turnover beat all previous
records in the year ending June,
1948, though the actual figure
hasn’t been broadcast. Gross
profit (at £235,819) showed a 62
p.c. improvement on 1946-47.
After general expenses of
£150,624 and tax provision of
£32,546, the declared net profit
was £52,649, Dividends totalling
no less than £50,000, and mostly
tax-free, were distributed to-
wards the end of the term.
Now it is proposed to increase
capital by a further £150,000.
Issues have been made of 75,000
5 p.c. prefs. at par to the public
and 75,000 ords. at 6s. premium
to existing shareholders (one-for-
two). Applications for both
issues , closed oversubscribed
early in December.
Tutt Bryant not only holds
Australia - wide distributing
rights from some of the largest
U.S. makers of constructional
machines, but has licences to
manufacture many lines
tractors, power-shovels, bitu-
men-spraying and -loading
gear, dredging-buckets, lifting
equipment, refuse-collectors, etc.
Besides the headquarters at
Rydalmere (outside Sydney),
there are wholly-owned subsidi-
aries operating in Melbourne
and Adelaide, while the company
shares control of Westralian Tutt
Bryant Pty. with the Westralian
Farmers Co-operative, Ltd.
Increasing turnover in the first
months of the current term and
strong demand for various lines
are cited by the board as reasons
for the new capital issues. A
total of £449,775 was owed to
secured and unsecured creditors
in June, accommodating the
co.’s own large debtor balances
and stocks:
Consolidated Figures.
Paid capital £150,000
Reserves 4,590
Overdraft .. 143,102
Creditors 306,673
Tax provision 79,936
Staff funds 10,670
Freeholds 57,989

Stocks 343,052
Debtors 265,606

After the new issues the £1
ords, will ‘have net tangible
cover of 225. each. At the pre-
sent market price of 365., the
yield would be 5.5 p.c., assum-
ing repetition of the 10 p.c. divi-
dend, which was specifically
quoted last year as being paid
from 1946-47 earnings.
Emper’or (Fiji)
The Emperor .Mine, Tavua
field (Fiji), which netted £50,344
(down £43,258) for the year to
June 30 last, appears to be shap-
ing well underground. The
profit was struck after allowing
for depreciation (£18,491), taxa-
tion (£29,620) and spending an
extra £16,849 on development
(£56,118). The drop in profit was
due partly to higher expenditure
on development, partly to a fall
in average grade of ore treated
and partly to a steep rise in
costs, which stepped up in this
way:-
Costs— 1946. 1947. 1948.
s. d. s. d. s. d.
Mining .. 10 10.0 14 0.8 17 5.0
Milling .. 0 11.9 18 6.0 20 3.2
General .. 5 11.1 7 8.9 8 11.5
,33 9.0 40 3.7 46 7.7
The figures exclude development
and depreciation charges, etc.
Chief factors responsible for the
rise were wage-lifts, higher
prices for materials and power,
and the mining and treatment of
more sulphides. Treatment and
recovery figures compare:
, Gold ,
Treated, Head Re- Silver
Ore, Value covered, Recov’d,

1948. .148,370 7.76 55,417 19,200
Extraction was 87,2 p.c. as
against 89.5 p.c. in 1947. Of
the ore treated last term 79,511
tons were underground sul-
phides, the balance coming
from the open c u t, where
76,439 tons overburden was also
removed.
The board says the co, might
have to resort to selective mining
in order to offset the continued
advance of costs, unless the
price of gold is raised or per-
mission given to sell the yellow
metal in the free market. Re-
serves of semi-sulphide and sul-
phide ore at end June were put
at 900,000 tons (up 25,000 tons)
positive and 150,000 tons prob-
able, each averaging 7.Bdwt.
gold. Nearly half the aggregate
tonnage is in the opencut, which
is ' lower grade but cheaper to
handle than the sulphides.
Encoura gi n g developments
have occurred at No. 7 level.
Here 571 ft. of driving north on
the Duchess lode disclosed
102 ft. of 11.9dwt. ore over a
width of 41 in. and a further
154 ft. of 27.4dwt. stuff over a
width of 58in. In addition, a
drive parallel to the Loloma
boundary has brought to light
400 ft. of flat lode with values of
from 40dwt. to 80dwt. over
widths of 24in. to 60in. “Good
values” are also reported from
drives on the Monarch lode at
No. 7 level. These disclosures
and the fact that development is
well ahead of the mill should
make it possible to curtail ex-
penditure in this direction for a
while.
The holding co., Emperor
Mines, Ltd., returned a further
2s. a share (£191,400) on Decem-
ber 7, reducing paid capital to
£382,800 in f.-p. 4s. shares. Al-
together, it has handed share-
holders £571,400 in return of
capital and £570,000 in divi-
dends, a total of £1,141,000, or
£191,400 more than original paid
capital. No divs. have been
paid by either holding or operat-
ing co. since 1941 because of
the high rate of Australian in-
come tax. At end June last the
operating co.’s current assets
totalled £412,595 and current
liabilities £82,455. The market
prices the holding co.’s scrip at
12s. 9d., thus valuing the under-
taking at £1,220,175.
Victoria’s star gold-producer
and dividend-payer, A 1 Consoli-
dated, at Gaffney’s Creek, has a
paid capital of £36,000 in 90,000
shares of 10s. paid to Bs. each.
For the year to end August last
shareholders received eight divi-
dends totalling £175,500, or 395.
a share. During this period the
co. treated 12,323 tons ore for
22,5500 z. standard gold. The
ore came mainly from the rich
Victory reef (discovered in
1943), between Nos. 14 and 15
levels and partly from develop-
ment work on No. 17 level,
where values are erratic. Ore re-
serves are estimated at 10,200
tons, expected to average 12dwt.,
with some more payable stuff on
No. 15 level. The market prices
the scrip at 655. or thereabouts.
From its formation 16 years ago
to November 30 last the co. has
paid dividends aggregating
£702,000.

NOTES ON OPERA.
The criticism of J.C.W. for
sticking to the time-honored
curriculum of Verdi and Puccini
in the opera season leaves out
the real offender, which is the
public. Experience of the sea-
son in Melbourne was that if
“Butterfly” had been put on to
the exclusion of all the others
it would have been packed at
every session.
The attempt to run Massenet’s
“Manon” was a failure, though
a good performance. It lasted
four nights, and audiences were
so poor that a fifth performance
was cut out. One sapient young
critic of the dailies slammed it
down on two counts —firstly,
that the spoken dialogue was
omitted, and secondly, because
the management hadn’t had the
brains to cast Malatrasi in the
leading role instead of the For-
tunati. He must have read the
bit about the spoken dialogue in
some old book, because it is
never used at La Scala, Paris or
New York.
It can’t be denied that the
Firm did a pretty good job in
presenting 14 operas in as many
weeks under a 40-hour-week
regime where, if Signor Ghione
wanted the orchestra back to re-
hearse a few bars of “Boheme,”
bang went £5O.
None of the critics seems to
have noticed that in Signor
Ghione they had probably the
greatest maestro who has come
to Australia. In Europe the
maestro is given credit or dis-
credit for every part of a per-
formance, not only the music,
and Ghione did a remarkable
job in moulding his queer lump
of clay into some resemblance
of a finished work of art.
On Cup Day I was in the
vicinity of His Majesty’s, and
the theatre was completely
empty except for the door-
keeper, but there was a solitary
figure on the pavement. It was
the 70-year-old maestro, no doubt
wondering what had happened
and still worried about the
second entrance in “Aida.”
The sigh of relief that went
up from the staff when the
Spirit of Progress carried the co.
off to Sydney nearly lifted the
roof of the theatre. Not that
there was anything* wrong with
the Italians —their behavior was
excellent —but the stage of the
theatre between operas was the
nearest approach to a mad-
house I have ever seen outside
Mont Park.
As for the programme, the
next opera season will start off
with “Aida” and include
“Butterfly” and “Boheme,” and
even good old “Trovatore,” just
like the last one, for the simple
reason that nine-tenths of
modern opera audiences have
never seen an opera, but they
have heard “Your Tiny Hand
Is Frozen” and “One Fine Day”
ad infinitum on the gramophone
and wireless, and the only rea-
son they go to an opera is to
hear their favorite ditties emerge
from the palpitating bosom of a
beautiful prima donna.
CAUBOY.
Minerva Melodrama.
An open landau, packed with
bewhiskered, high-collared and
crinolined persons, has recently
been seen parading the en-
virons of King’s Cross, Sydney,
with a large placard: “We’re
going to hiss the villain in ‘The
Streets of London.’ ” Besides
being a good advertisement for
the current show at the Minerva,
this spectacle is an excellent
summary of the play.
The play is good entertain-
ment. It is, simply, a Victorian
melodrama mortgages, dis-
tressed maidens and all —played
with the humorous exaggeration
of a Stephen Leacock sketch. It
is, at the best, sparklingly
funny. Quality of the acting is
high. Lou Vernon makes a fine
villain: he frowns and paces
and gloats most convincingly,
and does not yield to the temp-
tation to join in the fun —to take
time off, as it were, to laugh at
the burlesque. Grant Taylor is
the dashing and clear-cut hero.
Since Taylor frequently plays
“She keeps buttin'-in on my act!"
romantic leads seriously, his bur-
lesque of the part is the more
convincing as an indication of
his dramatic ability: humor is
a quality frequently lacking in
young and handsome actors.
Carmel Sexton is the dis-
tressed damsel, and Shirley Pat-
terson the rich and shamelessly-
calculating young lady. Kevin
Brennan is a distinguished
representative of the golden-
hearted poor, and Beb© Scott
takes the part of his wife. These,
and, in fact, the entire cast, are
entirely satisfactory. But the
play, after all, is a sketch: a bur-
lesque of a melodramatic fashion
with, perhaps, an underlying
nostalgic appeal in the fact that,
in the guise of comedy, it pre-
sents the Victorian melodrama
again. As in Leacock’s brilliant
prose sketches, it is difficult for
interest to be sustained: one
wearies of the wit and buf-
foonery. Anything “The Streets
of London” has to say is stated
.effectively in the first act, and
there is a pronounced flagging
of interest from then on; and
some ill-advised devices such as
a dance of bride and brides-
maids and a fireman’s song
merely drag out the perform-
ance, without adding anything of
humor or relevant interest to the
production.
"Cavalleria."
The hour of concentrated hate
and love which Mascagni and
his librettists Targioni-Torzetti
and Menasci packed into
“Cavalleria Rusticana” was given
adequate expression at Sydney
Tivoli. Germana di Giulio used
her drama-weighted soprano to
excellent advantage in the
powerful “Voi lo sapete.” Any
Sydney Rugby League fan would
have been delighted at the
ferocity with which Turiddu sank
his teeth into Alfio’s ear as a
token that the teamster had an
urgent appointment with a
dirk. Two extra-bright spots
in this best of all one-acters were
the spirited singing of the
Brindisi drinking-song and the
look of frustration on Enzo
Titta’s face as he attempted to
register surprise by raising his
make-up eyebrows—they flatly
refused to be elevated.
The short hop from Sicily to
Calabria was taken after the
chocs and ice-cream, and there
the stilettos flashed again in
“Pagliacci.”
Mario Basiola, sound in his
delineation of character, sang
the prologue solidly, if with no
great distinction, though he
achieved quite a ringing reson-
ance in the fin© andante.
Rafael Lagares was a rotund,
perspiring Canio who, after his
recent bout of laryngitis, was
only at about three-quarter
throttle in the “Vesti la giubba,”
that delight and despair of all
robust tenors.
Apart from Mercedes Fortu-
nati’s consistently-sung numbers,
especially the “Balletella,” the
best piece of singing in the opera
was the rhapsodic “Harlequin’s
Serenade,” sung off-stage by Fer-
dinando li Donni.
"Hansel and Gretel."
The National Theatre Move-
ment’s opera company closed its
account at Melbourne Princess
with Humperdinck’s “Hansel
and Gretel” and one of the most
prolonged spates of oratory in
local theatrical history—inspired
by Premier Hollway’s announce-
ment of a Government grant of
£5OOO annually for three years
for Australian opera.
“Hansel and Gretel” was not
quite as good as “The Bartered
Bride” of Smetana. Neverthe-
less, the fairytale atmosphere
was well maintained, esneciallv
by Dorothea Deegan and Nancy
Rasmussen as the babes in the
wood of one night and Justine
Rettick and Hlinka de Tarc-
zynska of another. The witch
of Winifred Gardiner was an
admirable piece of acting. John
Rowell’s decor was uninspired
journeyman work, and the pre-
ceding ballet, “The Pearl,” by
Jean Alexander, lacked lustre.
* * * *
The Ballet Rambert finishes its
Melbourne season with one new
ballet, which was not dis-
tinguished, and sundry revivals,
the best of which was “The
Sailor’s Return,” made accept-
able by the extraordinarily sen-
sitive miming of little Sally Gil-
mour as the black wife brought
home to the English village.
When Miss Gilmour dances on
with a baby she somehow or
other doesn’t make you think
how much more interesting to
look at would be a real nursing
mother. Most ballet - dancers
do. When they come out as
tennis-players in some arty-
crafty ballet to somebody’s
music and give a poke at the
ball with a racquet all you think
is: “Why are they making fools
of themselves like that? Gerald
Patterson is ever so much more
graceful.” It doesn’t seem to
occur to choreographers and
dancers that they ought to go
out and observe things before
they try to depict them.
Melbourne Pantomime.
At Christmas-time these days
the kids have to be thankful for
small mercies, and the issue of
pantomime, compared to the
great days before the talkies,
when there were anything up to
a dozen, is slender. This year
Wirth’s is presenting its usual
half-man, half-horse, plus ele-
phants-and-tigers business under
the title of “Jack and the Bean-
stalk,” and the Tivoli is provid-
ing an ornate repast in. “Cinder-
ella,” with some of its best acts
garnishing the dish and the Tiv.
lovelies reinforced by ballets of
clever youngsters. The kids love
them; no doubt it gives them
inspiration to see their own class
doing things ostensibly as well
as the grown-ups. Joyce Oration
makes a stunning Cinderella, and
drives to the ball in a glittering
coach drawn by ponies from the
Wild Life Sanctuary at Balwyn.
Next in order of attraction is
Ormonde Douglas as the Demon
whose machinations are con-
tinually frustrated by the shrill
yells of the audience, always
ready to betray Evil so that
Good may follow. As Buttons,
Terry Scanlon provides the bulk
of the comedy, and, as Prince
Charming, Margaret Fitzgibbon
supplies some of the singing be-
tween intervals of hunting the
pumps of Cinderella,
Students at Play.
The annual exhibition of work
by students of the National Gal-
lery in Melbourne is once again
divided up into classes. There
is the Dargie class, the Griffin
class and the Sumner class, and
each of the masters thus named
appears to have taught his
pupils, so to speak, a different
language.
The Dargie class show some
signs of having been taught a
method of measuring up tonal
relations, the Griffin class appear
to reflect the conventions of.
Bernard Hall, and the Sumner
class don’t seem to be bothered
by any rules at all, though some
of them may be trying to play
billiards with a football, meta-
phorically speaking.
The general effect, in con-
sequence, is very odd, and it is
most odd where a large number
of students have all painted the
same nude model. It is obvious
from certain facts that they have
all had the same subject before
them, but the results are as dif-
ferent as chalk from cheese, and
some have even reversed their
contrasts. It is as if an orch-
estra set out to play a symphony
and each member used his own
private system of musical nota-
tion.
A large number of these
students are in the school under
the Rehabilitation scheme. On
the evidence of this exhibition
they are being fitted out for it
as engineers would be if they
were taught that two and two is
four, five, fifty, or anything you
care to fancy.
At the Talkies.
Thwarted from, displaying
their films of Soviet might and
grandeur, the Realist Film Asso-
ciation has reverted to the
silents, and is now way back in
1928 with a film screened at the
Nicholas Hall, Melbourne,
called “The Italian Straw Hat,”
by Rene Clair. Described as a
brilliant classic of the French
screen and a side-splitting
comedy featuring madame and
her soldier-lover, a harassed
bridegroom, a suspicious hus-
band, a horde of wedding guests
and an elusive straw hat, it is
claimed to he a biting satire
on the morality of the petite
bourgeoisie. If so, then any
film in the contemporary theatre
can be so described, since the
goings-on depicted are much the
same as in every second Holly-
wood picture. The only dif-
ference is that the photography
is bad, the miming mediocre and
the general quality of the opus
such as to make one breathe a
prayer of gratitude for the
talkies.
* * * *
“My Wild Irish Rose,” at Syd-
ney Regent, a technicolor ver-
sion of the life of song-writer
Chauncey Ollcott, is all that its
title implies. Dennis Morgan
has a face like the map of Ire-
land, a persuasive way with
him and a melodious voice well
fitted for the rendering of Irish
melodies, which he does on the
slightest provocation. Arline
Dahl is the appealing object .of
Morgan’s devotion; Andrea
King takes the part of Lillian
Russell, the sophisticated star
who gives Morgan a hand up the
ladder. And Ben Blue scores
the laughs, “Atmosphere” and
sentiment are both applied with
a trowel of generous propor-
tions.

As one has almost come to expect,
the bookies were duly rescued from
the strife in which they found them-
selves after favorite Filipino had won
the Villiers. Relief turned up in the
guise of the lightly-weighted Regal
Son * (F. Williams) very easily win-
ning Monday’s Summer Cup. Regal
Son is a four-year-old gelding by
Foxbridge-Mittie; he carried 7.5 ana
won by several lengths from Hurry
Up and Cape Neddick.
Other winners at Randwick on
Monday were Pantomime (J. Thomp-
son) making an exhibition of the
December Stakes’ field; Cragside (J.
Thompson) taking the seven-furlongs
Chisholm Handicap; Transaction
(W. Cook) the Trial Stakes and
Triestina the Summer Nursery.

At Caulfield on Monday the 12-
furlongs Hopetoun Handicap pro-
duced a thrilling finish between Colin’s
Pride and Sir Actor. The camera
split them into that order. Gallant
Gentleman added to his fine record
by carrying 12.9 to comfortable suc-
cess in the Shoobra Hurdle and
merited a great hand from thp crowd;
next in the weights was Talon, who
finished second with 9.13. Other
winners were Boghasi in the
Holiday Stakes and Law Case in the
Malvern Handicap.

Measured in terms of newspaper
space and headlines, the best publicity-
agent Australia has had in America
over the past year has been a four-
footed one—Shannon. Generally cap-
turing public fancy, smashing records,
dominating racing on the West Coast,
becoming involved in controversies,
dumbfounding with some of his form-
reversals and being hailed as the only
thing in sight likely to give the Ameri-
can champion Citation a race for it,
Shannon has commanded more reams
of newsprint than Doc. Evatt ever
dreamed of.
Citation is evidently a real cracker-
jack. He certainly looks it in photo-
graphs solid and compact, deep-
chested, with powerful perfectly-
constructed legs, and a finely-chiselled
but thoroughly masculine head; in
color, a bay with black points. Last
season, as a three-year-old, he swept
the classics and made hacks of pretty
well everything stacked against him.
Just turning four-year-old now, he
is already well on the way to becom-
ing the first horse to win a million
dollars in stakes.
In the annual poll conducted by
the Baltimore Turf and Sports Digest
Citation was voted the Horse of the
Year, receiving 161 out of 163 votes.
He was also, naturally, rated the best
three-year-old. In the same poll
Shannon, known over there as Shan-
non 11, was voted the best of the
year in the four-year-old and upwards
division —a very high opinion, * since
one of his opponents in the poll
was the world’s leading stakewinner.
Stymie, who, when he was retired
recently, had over 900,0,00 dollars to
his credit.
When Peter Riddle bought Shannon
at the 1943 yearling sales he obtained
ffie colt for 350 guineas. After
Riddle’s death Shannon was auctioned
in Sydney and fetched 26,000 guineas,
which at the time seemed a ridicu-
lously high price. His subsequent
four runs here before going to
America mediocre performances —
seemed t.o confirm that opinion. How-
ever, the Midstream horse has con-
founded critics with his fine perform-
ances in America, and it is announced
that he has been syndicated for stud
purposes at 300,000,dollars (£A93,750).
Since he has, as well, won 211,600
dollars in stakes in the U.S., Neil
McCarthy made a wonderful profit
,on the 100,000 dollars he paid for
Shannon.
Not that it means anything particu-
larly, Shannon’s recent wins in
America, with the inflated prizes
offered over there, have carried the
Midstream horse to the head of the
list of Australian stakewinners, pass-
ing Phar Lap. A better line of
comparison between Shannon and
Phar Lap is offered by their respective
winnings in Australia. When he left
Australia Phar Lap had won £56,440,
and one win in the States carried his
total to £66,738. Shannon departed
Australia the winner of £18,987; one
American win was alone worth
£19,062, and in all he is credited with
around £85,000.
Shannon and Citation were to have
met in California in the 50,000-dollars
Tanforan Handicap. When weights
were issued for that race, however,
the syndicate which now owns Shan-
non took one look at the handi-
capper’s assessment and announced
that Shannon had finished his racing
career. Shannon was given 1271 b.
against Citation’s 1231 b. There was
an immediate outburst from all and
sundry, deprived of what looked the
best match race that could be staged
in America at present. Much abuse
was showered on both the owners ot
Shannon and the Tanforan handi-
capper, the latter being accused by
some sections of the press of having
simply given Citation a weight that
would ensure his appearing at the
Tanforan meeting. Looking at the
business from this distance, however,
it would seem that the owners of
Shannon had acted very sensibly in
declining the match, fpr, whatever had
been the o.utcome, the stud value of
the winner would have been in no
way enhanced, whereas that of the
loser would have been definitely
damaged.
The Shannon-Citation question will,
at any rate, give American racing
folk something to argue about for
years. Curiously, Shannon left a
similar question unanswered in Aus-
tralia, where his great contemporary
was Bernborough; strangely, the two
will meet for the first time when they
become neighbors at the same stud
in Kentucky. Many Australian race-
goers will argue that Shannon would
have beaten Bernboroqgh, particularly
at a mile —an argument founded on
the very unsound basis of times.
Present writer’s opinion is, simply,
that Shannon was a very good horse;
Bernborough was a mighty horse.

I Round this time o’ year in Eng-
land the flat-gallopers are having their
winter spell and the steeplechasing
season is in full swing. A London
“Times” turf writer weighs in with
a fair description of a ’chase at
Windsor. They’re racing:
“The horses had hardly started
when a buzz of alarm went through
the stands. Chaka-and Bright Boy
were making for the paddock instead
of the open country. Persuaded to
round the turn, Bright Boy at once
gave in and fell at the next fence.
The outsider of the three, Singlestick,
finding the open ditch rather wider
than he had hoped for, jumped down
into it. His rider unwisely remounted
and attacked the obstacle with re-
newed fury. Singlestick again
went downwards when he was
expected to go upwards. He
stood in the bottom of his
trench while his late partner
flew through the air in hot
pursuit of the disappearing
Chaka. In a distant part of the
course Chaka suddenly lost in-
terest. He refused the same
fence three times. Betting
continued briskly along the
rails, most trade now being
done on the odds offered
against ‘no race.! But when backers
had finished with this, Chaka changed
his mind and came home like a Gold
Cup winner. It was his eighth win
at Windsor.”
Apropos of steeplechasing, another
London “Times” man expresses con-
cern at, the difficulty these days of
buying in England horses likely to
make good ’chasers. Seeking the
cause he points put:—
“More and more breeders have
devoted their land to mares whose
produce can be sold as yearlings at
Doncaster, Newmarket and Balls-
bridge. Since the reward is generally
greater for 18 months’ keep for these
prospective winners on the Flat than
for about four years’ keep for the
’chasers, their decision is hardly to
be wondered at. Large cattle-farmers
who keep a few mares have been
the main source from which ’chasers
have sprung in the past. Their train-
ing has usually been first in the hunt-
ing field, then in point-to-pomts, and
finally on the racecourse. So valu-
able have the best bred become now
that the first two stages are begin-
ning to lapse.”

News which will be well received
in American turf circles is the like-
lihood of some modification in the
terms of the British General Stud
Book, so as to admit some prominent
American strains hitherto excluded.
Their exclusion has been a very sore
point with American racing folk.
The book has been closed since
1911 to all except horses then in it
and their direct descendants. A num-
ber of outstanding and quite truly-
bred French, American and other
foreign horses have found themselves
on the outer as regards the Stud
Book, among them America’s cham-
pion, Man o’ War, and this year’s
English Derby and St. Leger win-
ners, My Love (Fr.) and Black Tar-
quin (U.S.A.) respectively. Despite
his exclusion from the Stud Book,
however, My Love was recently syn-
dicated for £140,000.
Early this year tffe Jockey Club
appointed a special committee headed
by the Duke of Norfolk to advise
Weatherby and Son, publishers of
the Stud Book, whether conditions
should be changed. The committee’s
recommendation of some modification
is almost certain to be adopted.
* * * *
Statistics for the American racing
season just concluded show a distinct
tightening of the purse-strings. It is
significant that attendance has
dropped comparatively little, but tote-
turnover figures have taken quite a
plunge, indicating that the same regu-
lars are going to the races but betting
in smaller amounts.
Betting on horse-races is legal in only
21 of the 48 United States. In those
21 States duriijg 1948 there were 2367
race-days, which saw a total
attendance of 24,399,465 putting
1,555,465,534 dollars through the
tote. Corresponding figures for 1947
were 2405 race-days, an attendance
of 25,767,881 and a tote turnover
of 1,681,533,256 dollars. Thus while
attendance declined roughly five per
cent, there was an eight per cent,
drop in betting.
New York State, of course, heads
the list in the cash department, de-
spite the fact that climatic conditions
on the east coast confine racing to
the warmer seasons. In New York
there were 196 days of racing for an
attendance of 4,400,778 and a tote-
handle of 333,028,308 dollars. Cali-
fornia, on the other hand, with its
nearly-all-the-year-round racing, had
313 days’ sport; attendance was
greater than that in New York, ex-
ceeding 5,000,000, but the machines
handled about 5,000,000 dollars less
than in the Eastern State.
The tightest racegoers in America
and the most poorly-attended meet-
“I know you cant swim; but can you dive?”
ings must be those of Ohio. With
218 meetings for the year, racing in
Ohio was attended by 802,400 punters
putting 25,775,681 dollars through the
tote. By contrast was the tote-
handle of 25,967,574 dollars in Dela-
ware, which had only 30 meetings
and a total attendance of 383,000.
One State in which racing has evi-
dently suffered a complete slump is
Oregon, with 13 meetings in 1948
against 46 the previous y#ar. Attend-
ance there dropped from 273,000 to
55.000 and the tote turnover from
6.421.000 dollars to 1,678,000 dollars.

Demonstrations against unpopular
winners are no Australian monopoly.
A New York “Times” correspondent
describes racegoers at La Plata
(Argentina) in process of expressing
their opinion that the favorite was
ridden a poor race:
“One person was wounded by a
bullet and an inspector employed by
the track was held on a charge of
using Bettors jumped on
to the track,* smashed windows in the
stands and burned newspapers in an
effort to set fire to the installations.
Police eventually restored order. The
wounded man was taken to the track
infirmary.”

To hand from California last week,
a note written on the beautifully
letterheaded paper of the St. Francis
Riding Club, and written in a hand
as rugged as the man who wrote it
—“Yours while the hoofs beat, Snowy
Baker.” Resident in the States for
many years now, the old champion
all-rounder has just taken up an
appointment as “Director of Activi-
ties” with the St. Francis Club, and
extends an open invitation for “any
Aussies coming this way to drop by
and ride with me.” Snowy’s de-
scription of the place makes the in-
vitation sound well worth taking up:
“We have an extensive polo-ground
surrounded by a race-track in the
centre of the famed and beautiful
Golden Gate Park. There are some
miles of riding tracks.” We can
assure Snowy that any locals able
to visit America these days are pretty
well certain to have some sort of an
interest in horses.

In almost identical weather con-
ditions to those of last year—one of
those blue-and-gold days which make
Sydney Harbor a gem of scenic
splendor—and with public interest as
keen as ever, the 18 boats in the
fourth annual Sydney-to-Hobart yacht
race broke away from the starter
■early on Boxing Day. The harbor
was alive with small craft, and pic-
nickers along the shores watched the
big fellows turn through the Heads
into the sparkling Pacific—a noble
sight. Most of the boats should be
in Hobart, 680 sea miles away, by
Saturday.
Sheffield Shield:
N.S.W. v. S-A. at Adelaide was a
rattling good match. With the luck
all their way, the ’Walers held a
lead of 47 runs on the first innings
—243 to 196. In their second knock
N.S.W. closed at 353 for four wickets,
Moroney (98), Donaldson (84), James
(63 n. 0.) and Morris (61) getting
among the runs. Set 401 to win,
the South Australians treated a strong
bowling attack with high disdain and
had 358 on the board for five wickets
at stumps —only 43 runs short of a
grand win.
Shifting camp to Melbourne,
N.S.W k tackled Victoria (both un-
beaten this season), and a threatened
debacle was saved by Morris (177),
18-year-old J. Burke (69) and Lind-
wall (30 n. 0.). Four wickets were
down for 41 when Morris and Burke
took command and added 208 for the
fifth wicket. The day closed with
six wickets down for 306, after which
Christmas Day and a long week-end
were devoted to the annual assault on
the digestive organs.
At Perth, Queensland had little
difficulty in annihilating Westralia
outright by 142 runs. With a lead
of 128 on the first innings (276 to
148), the northerners closed their
second knock at 306 for five, Brown
(104) and Archer (86) putting up a
handy third-wicket stand of 151. Fpr
Westralia, Langdon (138) and Wil-
liams (50) did their best to stop the
rot, but the side collapsed for 292,
McCool twisting and twirling ’em to
the tune of 7 wickets for 128.
Stung by their narrow failure against
N.S.W., South Australia fairly hoed
into the Queensland bowling at Adel-
aide, knocking up 321 for eight
wickets on the first day and carrying
their score to 346 on the morrow.
The local skipper, P. Ridings, hit up
109, and all but two of. his team-
mates reached double figures. Un-
abashed by the ferocity of the oppo-
sition, the Queenslanders set out
slowly and methodically after the
runs. Brown (59 in 2| hours) and
Rex Rogers (75 in 199 min.) giving
a start of 128 for the first wicket. At
stumps the visitors had 230 for four
wickets.
* * * *
Amateurism these days has become
a very loose term, with every sport
entertaining its own notions on the
subject. Certainly it’s a far cry from
leading amateurs today to those of the
beginning of this century, when, in
England, to cite one case, a young
sculler who was proving a bit too
hot for the Gentry was declared a
pro. on the grounds that he earned
his living with his hands —he worked
in the markets.
The quaintest present-day interpre-
tation of amateurism, however, is that
recognised in the upper strata of
tennis circles —the delightful pretence
that a leading player, employed by
a sporting - poods manufacturer,
allowed unlimited time-off to travel
the land playing in every important
tournament, and using exclusively, of
course, his employer’s products, is
not earning his crust purely and
simply by his (or her) sporting
prowess.
When it comes to advertising these
sporting goods, the shamateurism
really becomes absurd. Evidently if
a player’s name was used in con-
junction with any particular product
in an advertisement it would instantly
brand him a pro. But publication
of a photograph of the player, plus
all - information necessary to identify
him, apparently leaves him a lily-
white amateur. Thus we see as an
advertisement for Basho racquets a
photograph of the 1950 national
champion, Whizz Jones, wielding a
Basho racquet, with, beneath, the
innocent remark that a Basho racquet
had won the 1950 National title. It’s
incredible.
* * * *
Jack Read takes a glance at the
pugilistic scene:
Forty years and a few days have
passed since Jack Johnson won the
world’s heavyweight championship
from Tommy Burns at Sydney
Stadium, but boxing is probably more
popular now than it was then, how-
ever sadly the standard may have
declined. At Sydney, Leichhardt,
Melbourne, Brisbane and Newcastle
stadiums capacity houses have been
more the rule than the exception dur-
ing 1948.
Sydney boxing, from the box-office
viewpoint, looked like taking a body-
blow when Vic Patrick (one of the
best ring attractions since Darcy) re-
tired after outpointing American negro
Tommy Stenhouse last June. Row-
ever, Dave Sands, Tommy Burns,
Mickey Tollis, Harry Hayes, Ken
Bailey and the newcomer Jack Hassen
give promise of another good season
in 1949.
Lightweights have always been very
popular in Australia, and since Pat-
rick retired the title has been vacant.
Sydney enthusiasts think it lies now
between Hassen and Bailey. Hassen,
improving rapidly as he gains ex-
perience with eveiy fight, is a terri-
fically hard puncher. Most k.o. ex-
perts are of the looping haymaker
persuasion, but Hassen has that in-
valuable rarity, a crisp, short, straight
exploder that would flatten a buffalo.
However, Bailey is a wily merchant,
a master of ringcraft, and Hassen
may find him very difficult to hit.
Among the bigger men middle-
weight Dave Sands stands head
and shoulders above the rest in ability
if not in stature. He is middle, light-
heavy, and heavyweight champion of
Australia. Sands has won 38 of his
67 contests by knockouts, but for
reasons best known to the manage-
ment has had only one bout at Syd-
ney Stadium during 1948, and is seri-
ously, and not unnaturally, thinking
of heading overseas.
Tommy Burns (baptised Geoffrey
Murphy) has been boxing almost nine
years and holds the welter title. He
has dabbled a little in the movie-
actor business and shouldn’t take
long to learn that the two professions
don’t mix. Having his first scrap
at Lismore in 1939, Burns has fought
65 matches and has been beaten only
four times—by Lisle Law, Vic Patrick,-
Ronnie James and Bennie Evans re-
spectively.
Eddie Miller, elderly, as leading
pugs go, at 31, is recognised as the
Australian fedder champ., though
these days he appears to do most of
his fighting in England; he has been
over t’other side nearly six months,
and, according to the book, his title
should lapse when he has been away
more than half a year. Miller re-
cently outpointed South African Tony
Lombard at London’s Royal Albert
Hall, and may soon meet Ronnie
Clayton for the Empire title.
Elley Bennett, like Hassen a
Queensland abo., holds the bantam-
weight title. Bennett has done most
of his boxing in Brisbane and Mel-
bourne but is likely to be seen in
Sydney soon. Likewise the flyweight
titleholder, Mickey Hill, another Bris-
bane man, may be seen against Jimmy
Hogg at Leichhardt early next year.
First-class Australian boxers are not
nearly as many (or as good) as they
were, and the best of them have been
mentioned above. Material for future
fistic fame is still in our midst, how-
ever, and we need only another in-
structor of Larry Foley’s calibre for
Australians to be among the world’s
best again, as they were from 1890
to around 1905.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
Money and Production
The year which is now clos-
ing has been one in which money
in a large volume has changed
hands in Australia, but in which
productivity has been far below
the level required to make the
nation really prosperous. The
housing shortage is the best
illustration of this state of
affairs; but there are other ex-
amples.
Business activity was fairly
well sustained during the year,
but there is evidence that spend-
ing is now closer to the level of
earning than it was in the period
immediately following the end
of the war. The rate of saving
is now only a little higher than
it was in the years that pre-
ceded the outbreak of war:
and at the present time inflating
prices are reducing the buying-
power of those banked-up sav-
ings of the people that were
established during the period of
war-time enforced thrift.
At June 30 last the volume
of money in the hands and bank
accounts of the Australian
people was £1623 million, an in-
crease of £B7 million on the
figure for 1947, and comparing
with £612 million in June, 1939.
A tremendous increase in the
nine years, but it is questionable
whether it will buy any more
than the 1939 savings would.
Buying-power would be better
if production per man-hour were
better.
During 1947-48 the earnings
of wage- and salary-earners rose
sharply over those of the previ-
ous year; the growth in the in-
come of companies was not so
steep. In fact, the growth in
wages and salaries between
1938-39 and 1947-48 was 105
p.c., while the growth in com-
pany earnings was only 88 p.c.
Furthermore, companies pay a
flat rate of 6s. in the £ taxation
before shareholders pay personal
tax in dividends received, so it
is plain that, since 1938-39, a far
greater proportion of the
national income is going to
wage-earners, to Governments
and to funds for the “social
security” of people who are
mainly wage-earners.
It is nowhere apparent, how-
ever,. that this redistribution of
the national income has made
the country more economically
stable or more productive. Quite
the contrary. In a state of “full
employment” there is far less
production per man-hour, and
costs-and-wages inflation is rife
throughout the country.
The calendar year 1948 was
the first full year of the 40-hour
week in all parts of the Com-
monwealth. In spite of the ap-
parent serenity of the Arbitra-
tion Court in granting the
award, it is obvious that the
thing was mistimed and mis-
placed. It did not even have the
“psychological” effect that its
sponsors might have hoped.
Higher production costs have
been the order of the day in
1948, and the basic wage has
been leaping after the cost of
living, with the usual inflationary
results. The State “Labor”
party that nearly broke its neck
in order to win an election by
early introduction of the 40-
hour week —the State is N. S.
Wales—is having great difficulty
now from saving the State trans-
port system from insolvency.
Industry’s Problems
Industry has still many prob-
lems to face. The latest has
been created by the Federal
Government’s private-company-
tax legislation, which makes it
desirable for many concerns, in
order to escape penalty taxation
on profits reserved for business
expansion, to convert into pub-
lic companies. This, in turn, has
brought a rush of new public
share-issues from hitherto pri-
vate enterprises. The new
method of private-company tax
was introduced to deal with
abuses under the old system, but
the whole trouble derives from
the fact that Canberra and its
bureaucracy have no regard for
the difficulties of industry where
they themselves are confronted
with the minor administrative
problem of making their tax
laws watertight. The point
appears to be approaching
when sections of industry may
break down because an all-
powerful central Government
has become so involved in the
problems of its own administra-
tion that it kills enterprise in the
process.
A major difficulty in industry
is still that of deliberately-created
shortages of raw materials and
Communist - engineered defici-
encies in transport and fuel ser-
vices. In the first 40-hour-week
year a special effort was made
by the Communist-run unions to
crack industry open through
their strikes, “blockades” and
other techniques of the “cold
war,” The attitude of the
A.W.U., the Hanlon Govern-
ment in Queensland and the
Hollway Government in Vic-
toria has been intensely in-
teresting to industrialists taking
an intelligent view of the eco-
nomic situation in Australia
during 1948.
The Sharemarket
The sharemarket as a whole
in Australia closed at a weaker
level than the buoyant mark on
which it opened. There was a
flood of new issues during the
year, which tended to swamp up
investment money available, and
some of these new issues, put
out at. a high premium, later- on
disappointed the market when
actual trading results came along.
Such a new issue was Rubtex.
Another float, offered at par and
not yet in production, disap-
pointed its backers: this was
Metropolitan Portland Cement,
subject of Bulletin criticisms
and attacks by the Opposition
in the Federal House. The
lOs.-paid £1 shares are being .un-
officially dealt in at 7s. 6d. The
co.’s talk of production before
the end of 1949 seems strangely
optimistic.
A new concern which reached
the production stage during the
year was Bitumen and Oil Re-
fineries. This has also disap-
pointed the market, and the scrip
has fallen from 38s. 3d. to
around 275. during this year. An
older-established concern which
has nevertheless added to its
capital at a great rate in recent
years, namely Felt and Textiles,
has also suffered severely in the
year’s market recession. The
ords. have dropped from 68s. to
565. A sharp readjustment also
occurred in one of the front-
rank stocks: Australian Con-
solidated Industries ords. sold at
575. last week, compared with
675, 9d. earlier in the year.
Disappointment with the
premium charged on the new
issue has had something to do
with the decline, as well, of
course, as the new issue (one for
10) itself. United Provisions has
also slipped heavily in the mar-
ket. In the food-canning and
ham-and-bacon business, its
earnings have never been a
model of stability.
Among the issues that held
their price well in 1948 we find
B.H.P. —58s. 6d. last week, corn-
“Now, madam, if you'll stand up I'll demonstrate
the shower .”
pared with a highest price of
60s. 9d. durfhg the year. British
Tobacco at 51s. 3d. last week
compared with a highest of
545. 6d. Bradford Cotton’s
525. 6d. compared with 565, 3d.,
Yarra Falls’s 675. with 68s. 6d.,
and C.S.R.’s £6O 15s. with
£63 2s. 6d. North Broken Hill
ended the year at a price some-
where about the level ruling in
January, 1948, but there had
been a big speculative rise
(stimulated by rising metal
prices overseas) in between,
which collapsed when the in-
creased costs involved in the lead
bonus, etc., became apparent to
the market.
Retailer shares, as forecast in
these pages many times, took a
dip during the year. The Syd-
ney Stock Exchange index for
the group opened for 1948 at
192.35 and closed at 179.08.
Ords. in David Jones, Sydney,
held their price better than most,
but Farmer’s ords. last week
were at 465., compared with a
highest of 535., and Mark Foy’s
at 455. 6d. compared with
525. 6d. G. J. Coles ords. last
week sold at 775. 3d., compared
with a highest of 87s, during the
year.
One stock which made a
strong rise during the year was
Masonite: up from a “low” of
465. to a “high” of 585., with
closing sales at 565. Div, was
increased from 8 p.c. to p.c.
The future of sound industrial
ord. shares generally looks as
secure as anything in a world
that is tiring of Socialism.
And inflation is not yet a spent
force.
Neon Signs
Restrictions against use of
lighting signs in New Zealand,
now entering their eighth year,
are the main barrier to expan-
sion of Claude Neon Lights of
N.Z., Ltd., said chairman V. J.
Lamer, in Auckland. War-time
controls were clamped down in
1941, and post-war power
shortages, because of almost
chronic troubles over water
or coal, are the worry of
the North Island today. Dis-
play signs in disuse for years
past will cost the co. a small
fortune to restore when the time
is right. Meanwhile it has
added £20,000 to reserve for
deferred maintenance (now
£50,000).
Fluorescent lighting is a horse
of a different color. Here im-
port-rationing is the bottleneck.
There’s a queue waiting, and
fixtures are being improved in
type and range, but imports
hold the key. Another direction
where the co. is held back is in
extending and rebuilding pre-
mises in the main cities; here
again it can’t move. Net profit
jumped £2149 to £20,679 for the
latest year (ended Sept. 30), and
was well over double 8 p.c. divi-
dend and 2 p.c. bonus needs (7
p.c. div. last year), which took
£8436. General reserve was
swelled £15,000 to £40,000. The
co. (with capital £84,355) looks
strong enough to be able to ride
through rough waters.
Wool worths (N.Z.)
One of N.Z.’s most prolific
moneymakers, Woolwo rths
(N.Z.), Ltd., has capped all past
performances by lifting net
profit £9210 to £149,972 in its
latest year (ended Oct. 2). Gross
earnings are up £24,210 to
£379,972, tax provision is
£230,000 (against £215,000), and
ord. div. is steady at 15 p.c.
(final 10 p.c.), but there’s no
bonus (2 p.c. last year). In 18
years since it got a foothold,
just as Maoriland was beginning
to feel the first squalls of the
big depression, the co. has paid
out over a million in divs. and
£2| million in taxes, has in-
creased capital eleven times over
by bonus scrip and share issues
at par, and today sees its shares
rated at nearly five times par
(55.) by M.L. investors. Off-
shoot of the Sydney concern, it
had a flying start. Latest results
don’t suggest that ceiling has
been touched for either turnover
or profit,
“Graz”: To the end of
November 2,352,163 bales of the
current wool clip had been re-
ceived at selling stores, 284,600
more than at the same date last
year, though only 31,143 more
bales had passed under the
hammer. Greasy averaged
46.26 d., 33 p.c. above cor-
responding figures for 1947;
scoured at 60.98 d. was 23.7
p.c. higher. Demand was so
brisk that in the five months the
J.O. bought-in only 1405 bales.
Europe, Yorkshire and Russia
made the market. Demand from
North America was slacker,
though some Europeans are re-
selling wool for dollars. H. J.
Devereaux, president of the
American Wool Council, esti-
mates U.S. wool production this
year as the lowest since 1867.
With its wool consumption 70
p.c. greater than in pre-war
years, the U.S. will have to im-
port more than half its supplies
of raw wool.
* * * *
There were 2,381,100 persons
employed in Australia (exclusive
of rural and domestic workers)
in August this year, which com-
pares with 2,269,000 in June,
1947. Of the 112,100 increase
in the 15 months, 27,900 went
on to Government payrolls,
making the Government total
592,000 —far and away the
largest army of civil servants this
country has ever had to cope
with. By comparison with the
27,900 people added to the Gov-
ernment payroll only 15,600
extra hands were taken on in the
building and construction trades.
Truly a sign of the times.


T. & G. Mutual Life Society
SPLENDID ACHIEVEMENT
The 72nd Annual Meeting of the Society was held
on Wednesday, 22nd December, at the Society s .
Head Office in Melbourne.
NEW BUSINESS.
The Chairman, Mr. J. T. Thomp-
son, said :
“New. Business completed com-
prised 124,537 Policies in the Life
Departments assuring £28,299,660,
an aggregate exceeding last year’s
total by £1,649,692, and is a record
in the history of the Society. This
result is a striking one, considering
that the business was derived from
Australia and New Zealand only,
whose populations total less than ten
millions. In the Accident Depart-
ment 12,210 Policies assuring
£4,315,975 were issued, and Accident
Benefits assuring £7,460,774 were
added to Life Policies. The large
volume of New Business was ‘in-
fluenced by monetary conditions
which reflected a high level of wages
and a low level of unemployment,
thus increasing capacity of the
public to provide Life Assurance
cover. It was also affected, by the
changing value of money due to con-
tinued inflation. Concern that assur-
ance cover provided may prove in-
sufficient for its purpose is reflected
in the increase in average amount
of each new Policy. However, I
believe 'that the increased business
results mainly from the Society’s
reputation for a high standard of
service to its Policyholders.. This
applies particularly to Group Assur-
ance, in which Department the
Society’s representatives must have
special qualifications.
“Group Assurance results were ex-
ceptional, New Business secured
being a substantial percentage of
Ordinary Department total. Many
more Group schemes, which fre-
quently include the operative em-
ployees, are now subsidised by
employers, most of whom are realiz-
ing that such schemes are indispen-
sable for promotion of goodwill and
retention of employees in the face of
keen competition for labour.
“Notwithstanding the large amount
of business written, Expense Ratios
in all Departments are practically
' unchanged despite higher wage rates
payable under Industrial Awards.
INCOME AND ASSURANCE
FUNDS.
“Income was £10,702,730, £4,028,869
was paid to Policyholders and the
year’s addition to Assurance Funds
was £4,480,408; all record figures in
the Society’s history.
“Assurance Funds, which repre-
sent the savings of Policyholders,
now amount to £58,823,711 and are
held for the benefit of Policyholders
only, there being no shareholders in
a Mutual Life Society. The Society’s
system, which controls the collection
of millions of periodic payments
annually, is of Immense benefit to
the members contributing, on whose
behalf satisfactory investments are
made from the common fund to en-
sure payment of all claims as they
arise. With safety of Policyholders’
Funds as the main objective, 77%
of the Assets are now invested in
Government and Local Body Loans.
The demand for loans on Mortgage
has Intensified recently. The
Society’s Home Purchase Scheme
continues to be very popular and has
assisted a large number of people to
acquire their own homes. Many have
completed payments, but there are
still more than 6,000 Policyholders
purchasing their homes through the
Society by easy monthly payments.
•‘•The rate of interest earned on
Ifife Department Funds showed a
slight decrease compared with the
previous year, due mainly to lower
prevailing market rates.
THE ACTUARIES’ REPORT.
“A surplus of £1,197,148 was re-,
vealed. The Actuaries recommend
that, after reserving £45,000 for
actuarial contingencies, the greater
part of the. balance be distributed
as Reversionary Bonuses maintain-
ing the present satisfactory scales.
Accident Department results were
again very satisfactory and its
premium revenue in Australia and
New Zealand increased by £31,194
to £238,059, a figure higher than that
of any other Office. £50,000 is being
transferred to reserve funds in Life
Departments. The use made by the
Accident Department of organisation
and Staff of Life Departments has
produced results advantageous to
Policyholders in both Life and
Accident Departments.
GREAT PROGRESS.
“Assets amounting to £61,706,697
are more than double those held in
1938. Assurances in force, covering
over 1,505,000 contracts, have also
doubled. That 43,418 or nearly
35 p.c, of Policies issued were taken
out by existing members is grati-
fying evidence of satisfaction with
the Society’s service.
BENEFITS OF MUTUAL
ASSURANCE.
“Life Assurance plays an important
part In the development of the
country's resources and expansion
of industry from which all members
of the community benefit. In addi-
tion to the benefits to the members
and the community wliich are de-
rived from Life Assurance generally,
there are advantages in belonging to
a purely mutual organization. We
and our other members are voluntary
partners in an enterprise wherein
we secure Life Assurance on most
favourable terms. All your Directors
are Policyholders and their decisions
are guided by the principle of
equity for all members while they
are entrusted with looking after
your interests. The Society encour-
ages the public to secure protection
for themselves and their dependants
against major economic hazards of
death and old age Instead of relying
too much on Social Security Benefits.
Valuable as these benefits are, it has
not been contemplated that any
Social Security system should be
capable of meeting the needs of
every person. The success of Mutual
Life Assurance is an outstanding ex-
ample of co-operative enterprise. It
has passed successfully through
wars and periods of depression and
is now more firmly entrenched in
public favour than ever before.
STAFF.
“All members of both Field and
Indoor Staffs have given of their
best in the interests? of Policy-
holders. I, therefore, take this
opportunity of thanking them for
their loyal and valued services.
“It is with deep regret that I
have to record the death during the
year of Col. Sir C. B. Merrett and
Mr. A. W. Relph, both of whom had
retired from the Society’s Board of
Directors through ill-health after a
long period of loyal and valuable
service. Their places were filled by
appointment of Mr. Harry Wilfred
Buckley and Mr. Douglas lan Men-
zies, and Policyholders are very for-
tunate to have secured their ser-
vices.”
Retiring Directors, Messrs. H. G.
Brain. R. A. Rowe, H. W. Buckley
and D. I. Menzies, and retiring
Auditors, Messrs. A. MeK. Hislop
and J. M. F. Relph, were re-elected.

MAORILAND INDUSTRY AND FINANCE.
Investment and Taxes
Stock Exchange chairmen in
Maoriland had a crack at taxes
and controls and threw a few
bricks at Finance Minister
Walter Nash and Co., in year-
end surveys. President Keith
Buttle, of N.Z.’s Stock Exchange
Association, didn’t like the out-
look when he said: “Our ex-
haustive tax-drainage system is
syphoning into the consolidated
fund a flow of economic life-
blood much greater than our
civilian economy can safely
spare if it is to remain healthy.”
And this: “Our system of war-
grown controls and regulations,
which influence much of our in-
dustrial and commercial activity,
and which we seem dreadfully
loath to abandon, is a diversion
of energy from the business of
real production which we will
not be able to stand pentoa-
nently. Those in authority
must realise, before it is too
late, that enterprise and initia-
tive must have adequate relief
from taxation before any worth-
while expansion or increase in
production can ever hope to be
achieved.”
Buttle saw trade and com-
merce being thrust more tightly
into the “straitjacket of bureau-
cracy.” Cos. expanding plants
or building premises have been
up against a crop of troubles in
the developing stage, and the
spirit of enterprise and adven-
ture has been dampened down.
Penal income-taxation heaped
on recipients of so-called “un-
earned income” from invested
funds was attacked by A. Hamil-
ton, Wellington stockbrokers’
chairman, who was up in arms
over the penalty on thrift.
“While it might seem hopeless
in this country to expect any
reasonable relief from taxation,
deeper consideration of the
problem is long overdue,” he
said. Maorilanders could over-
look low interest, but not dis-
crimination against investors as
a body. After the Government
paid interest on its stock, it met
recipients round the corner with
“halt and deliver” heavyweighted
tax demands. “Interference”
and “frustration” were the
Government’s twin evils in
dealing with business and in-
dustry. It seemed to glory in
raising all possible obstacles in
the path of producers.
Like M.L. industrialists,
brokers and investors want in-
centives, but they can’t see these
coming back while the tax load
is £l4O million a year and the
Dominion is the most tax-rid-
den country on the globe. Over-
grown State departments, public
extravagance, red-tape, delays,
prohibitions, controls, official
meddling and muddling, secrecy
and patronage are all part of
the dismal story.
Woollen Mills
Old-established woollen manu-
facturing cos. in Maoriland,
mainly in the South, aren’t
having things so much their own
way as new textile interests, with
strong financial backing, get
going in the North. Southerners,
disposed to treat the latest chal-
lengers, particularly Korma
(N.Z.) Textiles, Ltd., lightly at
first, are now changing their
attitude. They realise that
Korma, with powerful Aus-
tralian interests behind it, means
business, and must be reckoned
with,
Korma’s latest achievement
was oversubscription of its
475,000 issue of ords. on Nov.
4, lifting paid capital to a round
million, which should be enough
to complete and equip its big
new plant at Royal Oak, Auck-
land, due to be in full running
early in 1949. Felt and Textiles
of Australia, the co.’s foster-
parent, maintained its controlling
interest, gained a year ago, by
taking a solid block of 155,000
of latest shares.
“Aucklanders are very proud
of owning a ‘real live’ woollen
mill of their own after years of
mutely contemplating the
southern chain of looms, but
their infant is as modem as the
next moment and eschews
‘woollies,’ as we know and
appreciate them, in favor of
beachwear and boudoir specials,
apparently highly profitable
lines, though disciples of fashion,
as fleeting as a mortician’s
smile,” is a friendly southern
jibe. Canny Scot traditions in
finance down Dunedin way in-
fluence investors there to main-
tain allegiance to near-by mills,
free from what they call
“hazards of heavy capitalisation
and unpredictable initial divs.”
Bruce, Oamaru and Timaru
mills all yield better than 4 p.c.
on current share prices, and none
of them is capitalised as high
as a quarter of a million, even
at market valuation of shares.
Kaiapoi (Christchurch) has the
biggest capital of southern mills,
with £382,487. Mosgiel Woollen
Co. has had the leanest time
lately in the S.I. group, with net
profit down to £10,389 (year to
Oct. 6), against a peak of
£17,638 in 1946; but there’s
still a margin over 10 p.c. div.
demands of £9538, Bruce Wool-
len Co. had het profit of £26,311
(year to Sept. 19) to pay £lO,BOO
in divs., including 8 p.c. ord.
Southerners are counting on
solidity to keep the flag flying in
the struggle ahead.
Fanners and Exchange
N.Z. farmers had been robbed
“in one fell swoop” of £33 mil-
lion by the cut in exchange,
said J. T. Martin, retiring chair-
man of Wright, Stephenson,
Ltd., in championing producers’
interests at the co.’s annual
meeting in Wellington. He
based the figure on an esti-
mated record export- total of
£165 million if the pound had
stayed at the Australiau level for
the 1948-49 season.
M.L. farm costs have jumped
to danger-point, warned Martin,
and exporters are now under
the same handicap as when
M.L.’s pound was out of
line with Australia’s 16 years
ago. They’re paying from £8
12s. to £9 3s. a ton for super-
phosphate, against £6 3s. charged
to Australian farmers and under
£6 in U.K. Martin’s advice —
and other primary - industry
leaders echo it —is to get costs
down to where M.L. farmers can
face rising , overseas competi-
tion without fear of going broke.
If M.L. Laborites seek the easy
way out by raiding meat and
dairy pooled funds of £36 mil-
lion to bolster payments while
export markets are at their peak,
it’s a poor lookout for the day
when world prices start to slip
back. .
Canada ? s wheat crop for 1948
is now estimated at 393 million
bushels, compared with 337 mil-
lion bushels for the 1947 crop.
Australia, which produced
219 million bushels last harvest,
will not do so well this year.
But world production of wheat
and grain in 1948 is likely to be
at a very high level.


ABORGINALTIES
“Bo”: Totem Bend had long got used
to the sight of old Jim Archer every
Saturday afternoon pouring a couple of
pints of beer into his upturned hat on
the verandah of the pub for ths delecta-
tion of his moke Ginger, an elderly addict
who had taken a fancy to his pot of suds
from colthood. On Christmas Eve Jim had
given his horse an open invitation to* join
him in his celebrations, and throughout
the afternoon had steadily plied Ginger
with the right stuff. The horse was fairly
well primed when Jim reached that stage
of fatuous sentimentality in which, if he’d
had a wife, he’d have pulled out her
photo, and howled over it. As it was he
referred to Ginger affectionately in his
hearing as “a useless old blankard, but /
like him.” .Jim came limping into the
pub on Boxing Day, and when Big Bob
wanted to know what he’d done to his leg
Jim scowled, “Dunno exactly,” he re-
plied. “But X got me suspicions.” “What,
did some cove clout y’?” asked Bob.
“No, not someone ,” emphasised Jim, “but
I got a lump as big as an orange on me
leg, an’ I thipk it was Ginger took it out
on me when we got home last week—l
think he heard what I called him. You
know, Ginger’s a bad-tempered cow when
he’s had a few! ”
* * * *
“Bogaduck”: About 20 years ago a
squatter living on the border between
S.A. and Victoria deepened a lagoon near
his homestead and put a bank across the
outlet, thus turning what had. been a
seasonal swamp into a permanent lake.
He also released a few pairs of English
mallards on it, and declared the place a
sanctuary. It soon became covered with
wildfowl, the black duck —which seems
willing to mate with anything having
webbed feet —among them. They crossed
with the mallards, and within a few years
the South Australian Museum began to
receive weird-looking wild ducks for
identification —blue ones with white
heads, black ones with metallic green
heads, and others with all the colors of
an artist’s palette mixed up in splotches
and patches. It had the ornithologist
puzzled for a time, but lie soon hit on the
correct explanation. Since then these
quackejrs have been reported
from places hundreds of miles away from
that area. Some ornithologists seem to be
quite annoyed about it, but I can’t see
why it should worry anyone—they taste
quite as good as either of the originals.
♦ * * ♦
“Mat’s Mate”: We got off the Wam-
boota coach in Moama and made for
the Border Inn, only to be arrested by
an individual holding up a verandah-post
who said, “Got a deener for a drink,
mate?” Mat stopped and said, “Too
right; where’s the drink?” The bot eyed
him and me and said. “I ain’t sellin’
drinks, mate. I want one meself.” “Then
y don’t want a deener,” Mat said.
Drinks ain’t a deener. Y’ can get a drink
for a zac [remember those days?]. What
d y’ mean, askin’ for a deener?” The
bot drew himself up, spat into the road,
glared at us and barked, “Look, gimme
a deener of don’t gimme a deener. Please
y r ruddy self. But don’t try t’ tell me
how t’ run me business, see!” And he
stalked majestically away.

‘ Old-timer”; Little Curl hit the station
about midnight and just when the five-
mile ride from town had thoroughly
mixed up what he had drunk at the post-
master’s send-off. He dropped from his
neddy at the horseyard gate but got
slewed in the gloom and somehow got
into the drafting-yards. He felt his way
around in the darkness, found a rail and
followed it with his hands. After feel-
ipg round and round the main yard for
several miles, he concluded he’d got on
to the Kilfera boundary-fence somehow
and was lost, so he put up a yell for
help. Eleven tethered dogs took up the
cry, two roosters crowed and the boss
surged forth into the night with a stock-
whip to quieten the dogs. The boss’s
language convinced Little Curl he was
somewhere near home, and he made
straight for the sound, falling over several
fences on the way. The boss was stalk-
ing from kennel to kennel among the
yelping hounds when from behind one
emerged Little Curl. The boss grabbed
him, struck a match, examined his find
and then threw Little Curl away. “Strike
me roan!” he roared. “A man spends
half his flamin’ wool-clip providin’ y’
With a hut like a first-class pub to sleep
in an’ y’ have t’ come creepin’ out sleep-
in’ in the ruddy dog-kennels. Get y’
time in the mornin’.” Then we captured
L.C. and dragged him to the hut. In
the morning the boss heard his explana-
tion and restored him to employment.
“But,” he warned, “nex’ time y’ come
home blithered, kick up yT row down
at the men’s hut; these dogs are the
only workers on the place an’ they gotter
“All right, all right—maybe We SHOULDN'T have got of at Darwin !”
get a good • night’s sleep.” There was
some talk of taking it up with the
A.W.U., but nothing ever came of it.

“W.J.D.”: At the sheep-station out
from Blackall (C.Q.) we sat down to one
of the best Christmas dinners we had
ever had: fish, smoking pig, duck and
turkey were on the menu, with all the
trimmings, vegetable and alcoholic. The
bab. asked Tom, the old boundary^-rider,
what bird he favored for the main course.
Tom staggered the cook by demanding
mutton —which he’d had every meal for
the last 364 days!

“Lub”: “Tim Barrow had the top farm
on Pebble Creek an’ did the mail-run bn
Mondees, We’n’sdees an’ Fridees,” related
Harry. “He’d collect the letters an’ stuff
f’r postin’ on the way down, an’ then,
when he’d got mellow at the pub, he’d
start f’r home. All the cockies had mail-
boxes on stands, an’ Tim’d drive his old
rattletrap flat-out up the road an’ let fly
at ’em with fetters an’ papers an’ parcels
as he whizzed past. O’ course, most o’
the mail ended up scattered along the
muddy or dusty road. Tim; wasn’t
apologetic about it, either. He’d chip in
quick about the way the mailboxes were
failin’ down an’ the wind blowin’ the
mail out after he put it in. He was a big
bloke with a fierce temper, so it wasn’t
worth arguin’ with him. But little Doddy
reckoned he’d git square, an’ he fixed, his
box Up proper, with a neat little door on
it an’ all. He didn’t git any more mail in
it than the other cockies, though Tim had
t’ drive up alongside an’ open the door
t’ git the letters an’ things f’r the post-
office on his way down. One mornin’, in
a great hurry, he swung open the door,
an’ nex’ thing there’s a swarm o’ bees
come tearin’ out. By the time Tim’d got
away an’ dug bees an’ stings out of his
dial both his eyes were closin’ fast, but
he could still see enough t’ twig Doddy’s
eye in a sling, though it was a day older
than he thought—Doddy had got it
catchin’ the swarm. ‘Serves y’ damn
well right fT lettin’ bees git in yT mail-
box!’ Tim roared, ‘From now on a
bloke ought t’ sling yT mail out on the
road! ’”

“Taswegian”: I noticed a ydllow-tailed
thornbill fly past with something in its
beak and disappear into a clump of Cape
thorn. I found the nest, but to my sur-
prise it was empty. This didn’t tie up
with the fact that the bird was carrying
food. I took a closer look. Below the
apparently-deserted nest I found a cir-
cular opening, scarcely an inch in
diameter. I tried to see inside it, but the
thorns beat me, so I felt carefully inside
with my forefinger. The nesting chamber
containing three young birds was
spherical, about two inches in diameter,
and beautifully lined with feathers. Dry
and comfortable, it was perfectly pro-
tected by the decoy nest.

H. A. Lindsay: “South Land” (B.
15/12/’4B) quotes from my Bushman’s
Handbook the case of the American
soldiers who cut down wattle-trees near
their camp to obtain witchetty grubs, and
states that my instruction led to “wanton
destruction and despoliation of the bush-
land.” The trees in question were the
S.A. golden wattles, which mature-in from
six to 10 years, and the reason why the
landowners objected to their trees being
hacked about, as set forth in the official
letter in my files, was because they wanted
to cut the trees themselves for their
bark, the growing of wattles as a crop on
wasteland for the production of tanning-
bark being an important sideline in some
parts of S.A, So much for “One hour of
madness laying waste the silent harvest
of centuries”! If “S.L.” takes the trouble
to consult a bushman, an entomologist or
any bright bush kid who uses witchetty
grubs for fish-bait, or cares to take a
walk in the bush himself, he will discover
that you obtain witchetties by looking
for the wattles which have a dead or
dying appearance, or a sickly and stunted
100k —as pointed out on page 37 of my
book. In another year that tree would
be dead in any case, killed by grub-in-
festation. No destruction of trees which
have taken centuries to grow is ever
caused by securing these grubs; you
simply haul them with a hooked twig
or wire from the tunnels they have bored
in the roots or limbs of the big trees or
from the short-lived wattles which they
are already killing,

“Naturala”: If “Nto” (B. 1/12/’4B)
has .watched domestic and wild birds
handling large centipedes very casually
he has seen something I haven’t. The
lime and sandstone areas north and south
from Fremantle are great places for the
multi-legged crustacean ; also for magpies.
So maggie, wild or tame, does not err
from lack of experience when seeking to
dine on a 6in. centipede. Careful hardly
describes the pied bird’s method. A
quick rapier-like stab at the centipede’s
head, followed by an instant leap back.
Then a stab at the tail, followed by
instant retreat. And so until the potential
titbit is, minus both ends. Satisfied
finally that the multi-legged one is bereft
of death-dealing possibilities, maggie
then pulps it by passing the many-jointed
body through its beak crosswise, after
which a quick gobble completes the job.
And there must be something specially
toothsome about centipede meat, since
the magpie, so obviously afraid or the
creature, faces possible peril in order to
obtain the delicious morsel.

The local celebrity in the
small N.S.W. town where I was bank-
teller arrived regularly from his distant
holding each week to get his supplies.
Driving his sulky to the centre of the only
street he would pull up and then shout at
the top of his voice. At the door of every
shop would quickly appear the proprietor
or his assistant. Bill would then indicate
witJi his whip the party or parties wanted;
they would advance to the sulky and get
his orders. Then, after a session at the
pub, he’d round up the goods and depart,
and the township would slumber again
until old Bill’s next visit.

“Kelms”: A sheep may be, as “Sir
Spen” avers (B. 8/12/’4B), “capable of
masticating maize equally well with the
horse or any other ruminant.” That can
bo taken to infer that the horse is a
ruminant. It isn’t. For that reason a
horse comes out a poor second when it’s
sharing a tucker-box with a cow, which
wolfs more than its share, and lies down
to chew at its leisure. A horse takes
three days to digest its food, which
accounts for the severity of its colic
attacks. And whatever it swallows it
must pass—it is constitutionally incapable
of vomiting.

“Sth. E.”; Dad Parslow was drenching
lambs to check further losses when his
roving eye caught the small whirl of
smoke. From the fence-top he judged
the location to be five or six miles towards
the township, and, hastily flinging open
the gates, he dashed for the truck. “Fire,
Mum! ” he bawled as he passed the house.
“If I ain’t back be night, water the cattle
in the back paddick an’ go round the
dams to see nothin’s bogged.” Down
along the river Charlie Henderson was
irrigating lucerne, one eye on his milkers
through the patched and broken fence,
when he spotted the tell-tale haze. With
a colorful prayer towards the cows he
streaked for the road. All day and night
the men worked on the outbreak, and by
daylight had it well under control.
“Three of your milkers got blown on y’r
lucerne, yesterday, Chari,” an old bloke
reported, cantering up. “Bad luck,” Dad
Parslow sympathised. “Likely I’ve lorst
a few lambs meself through this thing.
But we saved all these crops o’ Thomp-
son’s,” he added, “even if we was short
o’ men. An’ that house o’ Brownie’s was
right in line, too.” He stopped thought-
fully. “Hey, where is that timber bloke?”
he inquired. “Ain’t seen him round, an’
he can’t be workin’ away on a Sat’dee.”
“No,” croaked Charlie. “Said he couldn’t
very well come an’ help. He dunno how
things stand yet with his mob, about this
here double-time they’re bringin’ in f’r
fightin’ week-end bushfires.”

“B. A, Ker”: Usually two men who
start a job on the same day automatically
team up as mates, but the round-faced,
nuggety chap seemed to have taken a
dislike t® his tall, lean workmate as
soon as they had selected their picks and
banjoes. By payday both men had be-
come accepted by the gang as good
blokes ; Nugget for his chiacking wit and
stock of yams. Slim because his slow
smile and quiet, agreeable nature made
him a pleasant fellow to work with.
But Nugget continued to dislike the thin
chap. In spite of Slim’s good-natured
tolerance —or, perhaps, because of it —
his wit took on a malicious tone whenever
it cracked at the long ’un; and as the
days passed the jokes became practical
and spitefully persistent. The whole of
the gang had an uncomfortable feeling
over the constant picking, and Bob (good-
hearted Bob) was moved to tell a white
lie: “You don’t want to push him too
far, you know. Nugget. I struck a bloke
who used to know him in the Army—
reckoned he won the championship of the
battalion.” Nugget roared derision.
“Him? That melon!” he scoffed—and
moulded his day’s amusement on those
lines. Not until we were putting the
tools away did Slim answer back; then
he made the mild reply: “You know,
you are putting yourself on a rather poor
rating—a man that couldn’t beat a
melon.” For a moment the stumpy one
looked as though He couldn’t believe it,
but a chuckle from one of the listening
mob moved him to action. More in con-
tempt than temper he swung an open-
hander that rang on the long fellow’s
queer little ear. The fight was short:
three lefts from an arm as long, thin and
rigid as a crowbar, then a faint opening
the way for a right as long, as thin, but
more solid. As Slim himself was busy
with the first-aid kit on his vanquished
opponent somebody chiacked: “Do you
still think he’s a melon, Nugg.?” Slowly
a rueful grin grew on the battered face.
“I’m sure of it,” he said. “I had to
crack him to find put how good he was.”
WHEAT COUNTRY.
A wind well-laden with scent and heat
Drifts through the saplingsVragged crests
And leans on the lovely curving breasts
Of the cool green wheat.
The curtseying harvest, hazed in light,
Ripples and runs from the air’s embrace.
Over their waves the white clouds chase
Grey shadows out of sight.
Yellow weed-bloom where the headland narrows,
Daggered thistles in purple pride;
Cockatoos feeding, watchful-eyed,
Show-flaked along the furrows.
Darting parrakeets down the track
Hurl like a handful of jewels tossed
Into the blue and therein lost,
No one to fling them back.
All the Wimmera is under cover
Heaven and the harvest, verge to verge,
Joined try the heat-wave’s silver surge
Just where the blue bends over.
The world that the harvest grain is clothing
Seems to descend and disappear
In a scintillation of aching air
Over the edge of nothing.
And the rolling wheat and the world appear
To turn so softly through time and space
The air of it passing upon my face
Scarcely ruffles my hair.

“Solitude”; Riding past the store we
spotted dozens of bits of colored papers
hanging in the windows, while in the pub
yards a couple of outsize turkeys strutted
and a young porker looked from a netted
stall. Then a mouth-watering smell hit
our range, and following the beam
Seventyfiver eyed the half-dozen white-
coated objects swinging from the
verandah-roof. “Puddings,” Mrs. Bung
informed him. “For Christmas.” The
old bloke mooched off thoughtfully, and
as we neared the hut that night I caught
an air of mystery. With unusual care he
carried in his pack, laid it down in the
comer, then changed his mind and shifted
it*to the top of the chaff before lending a
hand with the tea-billy. By the time the
tucker was mustered and the ants banged
out of the pannikins his secret had got the
better of him. “Look, Sol,” he chuckled,
lifting a tin-, of bully-beef from his
manure-bag pack and turning it admir-
ingly, “And that ain’t all. Look at this.”
He held up the second tin. “Gripes,
golden syrup,” I grinned. “Been scarce
lately. Chuck it here.” “No!” Deter-,
minedly, he shoved it back. “We’re
gonna be camped out on the back run
again this year,” he explained. “An’
hanged if I see why all them folks down
there should have this here Christmas
business on their own.”

“Sou’-west”: The poetical idea of that
Westralian fisheries inspector that the big
sea-salmon that run the W.A. coast about
Easter-time have community hospitals (B.
24/11/ ’4B) has been known to W.A.
fishermen for a century. These big fish
fall a ready prey to the shark; thus
wounded ones often find it necessary to
take refuge in the shallows. A favorite
sanctuary will be any reef surrounded
by deep water and still covered, even to
as low as a foot, at low tide. Lying off
such a reef and casting a bait on a thin,
strong line one may always be sure of a
catch, since the salmon, being confined
here until they recover, are ravenous.

“Barnyard Bill”: And what would
those farsighted citizens of Wellington
(M.L.) whisper into official ears concern-
ing those 12 laying fowls who must live
bereft of male society (B. 1/12/’48)?
Doesn’t “Uramao” know that the
“spinsterhood” of the laying pullet is the
foundation of the commercial poultry
industry? That hens lay much better
when segregated from the rooster? Non-
fertile eggs keep much longer than fertile
ones, which can’t successfully be “put
down” in preservative of any kind. With
regard to the continuance of the species,
nearly every poultry-farm keeps a few

to the incubators not only to maintain
stocks, but also to permit the market to
supply day-old chicks in quantities that
put any possible disappearance of the
domestic hen tribe out of question.

“W.J.W.”: A newspaper report of a
recent cyclone at Darwin mentioned that
some pearling luggers had no radio and
could not be warned. They’d be warned
all right if they were working. The first
indication of an approaching storm is a
heavy ground swell, very noticeable on
the ocean floor and recognised by any ex-
perienced diver. The storm which sank
the Koombana was reported to a lugger-
skipper by his diver early in the. after-
noon, He made for Cossack, 20 miles
away, and by midnight he was within
three miles of the port. That was the
closest he got to it. He’d have sold out
cheap then, but cyclones are funny things.
This one lifted him over two reefs and
dumped his lugger on a mangrove beach.

practically undamaged. Next morning
the lugger was proceeding serenely under
her own power when a coastal vessel was
sighted. It .was the Bullara: her super-
structure was wrecked, most of her boats
were damaged, and she was trailing her
smokestack. The Koombana probably
didn’t suffer a tenth of that damage be-
fore she turned turtle.

“Guy Mopoke”: I was sitting on a log
having a bit of lunch and watching a
brace of young rabbits hopping in and
out of a large warren some little distance
away. Suddenly a big goanna appeared
from nowhere and grabbed one of the
youngsters. He was moving leisurely to-
wards the nearest tree when an old doe
shot from the warren and charged the go.
In the flurry of dust and fur it was hard to
follow the course of the scrap, but it did
seem the old girl got in her best punches
with her hind-legs. In the final round
the go. stopped one under the ear which
bowled him oyer, releasing the youngster.

“Young Slim”: We were in Pinjarra
on the way through to a job at Bruns-

job was taken, but we could get in a
couple of days gaffiering up strays it

he roared the faster it went. Eventually
both horse and rider arrived back the
homestead in a lather of sweat The
cocky, following on with me, could hardly
sit his mount for laughing, and revealed
to my short-tempered parent that the
horse was trained to gallop when told
to stop. He was still laughing when the
old man tore into him.

“Ipswich”; Darky, maintained at
Sandy Cape Lighthouse, Frazer Island,
by the Department of Navigation and
Shipping, must surely have been the most
regimented of horses. For more than 20
years he fed from the same bin, drank
from the same trough,
paced the same path
round his small en-
closure or sheltered
from the elements in the
stable. The only occa-
sions on which he
passed through the
yard gate coincided
with the quarterly
arrival of the supply-
ship, and then only to
haul provisions from
beach to lighthouse,
300 ft. above, before re-
tiring to his solitude
for a further three
months. Once only did
he deviate from this
routine. To salvage
equipment from a
crashed aircraft on the
ocean side of the island
we enlisted his aid. Per-
haps he reflected that
it was a short three
months, for he was re-
luctant to leave the
yard, and protested
even more vigorously
when urged to pass the
beach. We reached
Indian Head by night-
fall, and when we tried to water Darkie the
routine of two decades proved too strong.
He found it'a physical impossibility to
reach closer to the water than the height
of his familiar trough. Almost driven
frantic by the smell of the water, after
an hour’s frustrated endeavor he solved
the problem by lying down on the bank
on his side and snaking his head for-
ward until he reached the water a
ludicrous but, withal, a pathetic sight.

“Trim”: Shaggy has been round the
back-blocks all day looking for prospects
and picking up any information available.
Gets on the trail of a likely land ex-
change, delays things until after dark,
strikes a heavy rainstorm, gets hopelessly
bogged, leaves the car and walks a mile
or so to Janetzki’s place, which he knows
has the nearest phone, and arrives wet
through. Learns that floods are between
there and town, so he accepts Janetzki’s
offer to stay the night. Janetzki’s got a
family of seven boys aged from 17 down-
wards. Eldest suggests a game of draughts.
Shaggy reckons that to be popular with
your client you’ve got to be popular with
his family, so he plays draughts. Shaggy
tells himself he’s got to be well in with
these typical bush kids —there’s many
future property- and machinery-sales in
a family like this. He figures to let them
win a couple of gajnes and then win an
odd one himself. By midnight they’ve all
had a go at Shaggy, who, try as he might,
hasn’t won a game. At that hour they’re
just about to wake the six-year-old
youngest up to have a crack when
Janetzki calls it a day.

“Gravelsnatcher”: I’ve always accepted
the oft-reiterated belief that Nature
wastes nothing and has created nothing
without a purpose. But I begin to doubt
pondering some pretty obvious examples
of Nature’s prodigality. With giant hand
and inconceivable power she has scat-
tered stars and planets and meteors
through limitless space in futile duplica-
tion of the atom. With infinite care and
patience she has designed innumerable
species and types of plants and animals,
when surely one, the perfect example of
her art, could have entered into its in-
heritance at the outset. With fire and
fury she has hurled land-masses up into
the air and deepened the oceans, then
created wind, rain, frosts and solar heat
to level the earth. With tiny streams and
swollen rivers she carries water to the
oceans, that it may provide the winds
with moisture to be rained on the land
to make the rivers flow. Her laws, fault-
less and irrevocable, she has drafted with
infinite care to govern alike the lives of
men and the course of comets, and to
guide both along the path to oblivion.
By a long, tedious and painful process of
evolution she has produced minds capable
of-reducing her and her entire works to
nothing by a complicated mathematical
process, and others which can view her
labors with rapturous anticipation of
eternity. Can Nature, the omniscient,
create a force greater than herself, and
by her laws design a mind which shall
rise above her dictates? If not, it seems
a shame that in the end there shall be not
even a voice, in all that vast nothingness
that was the world, to mourn the passing
of that ridiculous accident, Life.

Switching to Merinos.
THE MA N ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
“Pat O’Day”: In the Murray
Valley country from Monaro
almost to the Anabranch there’s
a big changeover from cross-
breds to Merinos —Merinos even
outing Corriedales on the river
flats, hitherto regarded as “cross-
bred country.” The reason, of
course, is the rising \vool mar-
ket, and contributing factors
are the scarcity of good cross-
bred lamb mothers and the fact
that Merinos can get through a
dry season better than the softer
sheep. In the area mentioned
many are selling off their cross-
bred lines in order to restock
with Merinos,
To a man with a small area—
500 to 1000 acres—the Merino
changeover will mean a good
opportunity to buy crossbreds,
which are a better - paying
proposition to him than Merinos.
In much of the Riverina the
small man who can produce
lambs and wool is on a good
thing, though he must have the
right kind of crossbred ewes and
fat-lamb rams to suit his area.
A south-west farmer this year
bred a line of Corriedale-South-
down lambs from Corriedale
ewes and not only made an
average of 50d. per lb. for his
August-shorn wool but marked
95 p.c. of lambs, though these
were mainly stores. His young
ewes will cut more wool next
year, and he estimates their
value —in lamb —at £3 per head
now. He has enough fodder
conserved to put his sheep
through two dry winters, if
necessary, and confidently ex-
pects to sell his wethers as fats
in January on a good market.
He isn’t dazzled by big Merino
wool prices, preferring .the
steadier, if less spectacular, in-
come from dual-purpose sheep.
N.S.W. Wheat Contests.
“He-Ne”; Having followed
the judge around the competing
crops in the R.A.S. champion-
ships, I’m satisfied that the
Society is defeating its two main
objects by the speed of the judg-
ing. The two objects are (a)
giving the growers a chance to
talk with the judge about various
aspects of their business, and
( b ) allowing the country people
to make contact with the R.A.S
itself so that its work for the
country can be appreciated.
On some days as many as
four crops were judged, some-
times 100 miles apart.. The
R.A.S. party would arrive at a
farm, the judge would hurry into
the crop, the pressmen get a few
hurried particulars from the
grower and the party then race
away. To some of the dazed
competitors it must have seemed
like a momentary dream. A
most useful purpose would be
served if the judge could have at
least half an hour on each pro-
perty* after the judging was
done,, Then the grower could,
have a talk with the judge arid
obtain information or have ques-
tions answered.
Most of the crops seen this
year were satisfactory and the
five divisional winners were:
Northern, V. B. McGowan,
Lindfield, Winton, 143£ points,
variety Kendee. Western, F.
“ You'll hear from my solicitors about this !”
Cameron and A. Clark, Brigen-
doon, Trangie, 13 \\ points, Ben-
cubbin. Central Slopes, C. D.
Renshaw and C. Meyers, Booga-
dah, Binnaway, 133 i points,
Gabo. Riverina, A. Sutherland
and L. H. Macpherson, Bar-
medman Station, Barmedman,
123 points, Bencubbin. Southern
Slopes, J. A. and H. R. Ross
and Cullen Bros., Garangula,
Harden, 128 points, Gabo.
Main points of interest were
the popularity and success of
Gabo and the decline of Ben-
cubbin, the suitability of Bordan
for early sowing and as a good
smother-crop for skeleton weed.
There was extensive frost dam-
age, and this included varieties
sown in season, which indicates
a need to evolve varieties having
a high resistance to cold or pos-
sibly varieties of winter habit.
The standard of seed purity was
not satisfactory, and it can be
assumed that the general run of
district crops would be below
standard. Crops were relatively
free from disease, and the grain
sample in most cases excellent.
Fertility is a major factor in
determining crop production, and
there has been a marked change
in cultivation methods. Where-
as at one time fallows were
cultivated many times, present-
day trend is to reduce cultivation
to a minimum, stock being used
to control summer weed growth
and add manure to the soil.
There exists an urgent need to
control soil - erosion ; many
farmers are lax in this regard.
Turkeys for Profit.
“Homo”: Instead of turkeys
which weigh over 501 b, when
fully grown we need a smaller
type such as is popular in
America. The lighter birds
would not be so easily injured,
would require less housing space,
be more easily handled and
much more popular with house-
wives. Even a hen of the
bronzewing breed is too large
for the average family.
If allowed to lay in her own
individual nest each hen will
produce a clutch of eggs and
hatch-out her poults without mis-
hap, unless rats or foxes inter-
fere. Young turkeys hatched in
this way are far hardier than in-
cubator poults, and escape
disease if greens are available.
On the other hand, if nests are
discovered and the eggs gathered
for the brooder three or four
clutches may be produced by
each hen. The provision of
curd for young poults, shelter
from' rain and hot sun, plenty
of clean, cool water, chopped
shallots, lucerne and other
greens and a separate run will
ensure success.
Telling Them.
“R.N.”; The speaker was F.
Eugene Ackerman, , executive
director of the American Wool
Council, to the Texas Goat and
Sheep Raisers’ Association, in
the Cactus Hotel, San Angelo,
Texas: —
Rayon are advertised and
promoted energetically as substitutes
for virgin wool tropical-weight suit-
ings on a price basis with the claim
that they look like wool, feel like
wool and even that they will wear
like wool. Rarely have more dulcet
and imaginative tones been played on
verbal piccolos intended to lead cus-
tomers into the land of Hokum. The
fact is that these rayon suitings are
made of the same inert rayon fibres
which go into a host of other apparel
items, including women’s underwear
and hosiery, and they possess the same
qualities and limitations of rayon in
any other garment.
Wool has the most impelling story
to tell of any fibres used by mankind.
Fabric is the very essence of clothing,
and the strength, resiliency, moisture
resistance, durability and low upkeep
are as much a part of the cost of
clothing as is the price paid. Here
wool has no substitute. Neither has
it any substitute from the standpoint
of health and comfort. The cost of
manufacturing substitute synthetic
fabrics into garments is higher than the
cost of making worsteds. For a com-
paratively • small sum now the wool-
textile industry can protect itself
against the inroads of »substitutes.
Once they are allowed to gain hold,
however, it is doubtful whether money,
effort of ingenuity can dislodge them.
It is an axiom that, unless circum-
vented, the cheap and inferior always
drives out ■ the higher cost and better
product. •
The International Wool Secretariat,
representing the woolgrowers of Aus-
tralia, New Zealand and South Atrica,
is the largest individual contributor
to this effort to find ways of improv-
ing the qualities, weights and textures
of wool textiles that can be made in
all grades of wool
The growing dependence of America
upon the British Dominions as its
chief sources for apparel wool makes
it imperative that both woolgrowers
and wool-textile manufacturers work
closely with our foreign sources of
supply to develop the grades of wool
most essential for the American
market.
After which, we may hope,
the assembly climbed aboard its
cayuses and loped off into the
chaparral to think it over.
Cost of Drought-feeding.
“Outback”: On two Queens-
land properties approximately
5000 sheep were fed on each,
and while the cost (excluding
distribution) on one property
for feeding for three months was
£4566, on the other it was only
£2383, On property “A” (cost
£4566) the ration consisted of
about 11b. of lucerne per head
per day, and 2 oz. of maize; on
property “B” some grain sor-
ghum (which was on hand) was
used initially, but, when further
supplies were unobtainable,
maize was used. When the price
of maize rose, a change was
made to rolled wheat, obtainable
at £l4 per ton. About
of grain and 2oz. lucerne per
head per day was the ration on
property “B.” Owing to the
higher nutritive content of the
grain, both rations were of
about the same feeding value,
but there was a tremendous
difference in cost.
Average price of lucerne, pur-
chased at Rockhampton and
railed to Winton, was £l6 per
ton, and of maize, purchased at
Atherton, £2O per ton. Drought-
freight on the railway for fodder
for property “A” for a month
was £l5O 15s. and road trans-
port from Winton to the pro-
perty absorbed another £l4B 15s.
per month; 66 tons of lucerne
cost £1056 f.0.r., and 8i tons
maize £167 f.o.r. The total cost
per month for fodder delivered
to the property was £1522 10s.
Property “B” purchased Ba-
tons lucerne at £l6 ton f.o.r. and
33 tons grain at £l4; total cost
of purchases was £596, drought
rail freights totalled £ll5 15s.
and road transport to property
£B2 155., or a total for the month
of £794 10s.
Water for Stock.
“Mr.”: Pigs on dry mash
need plenty of water or they
won’t consume enough feed to
make profitable growth. A
251 b, pig needs igal, of water
daily, increasing to l£gal, for
fatteners of 2001 b. live weight.
A sow with litter will drink four
to five gallons.
On dry pasture in hot weather
a sheep will drink up to ligal.
of water; a ewe nursing a lamb
3gal
A dry cow or a bullock, 8001 b.
to 10001 b. live weight, will
absorb seven to ten gallons a
day; a milking cow the same
quantity for maintenance, and
another of water for every
gallon of milk produced; which
means that a cow yielding 4gaL
of milk a day would need up to
16gal. of water. As a milker
will visit the trough as often as
10 times a day, the water should
be readily accessible.
Orchard' Erosion.
“Sarina”; Serious erosion of
orchard land may be lessened
by the growing of leguminous
crops. In Queensland coastal
districts erosion occurs during
the wet season, and, if sloping
ground is sown with cowpea, a
lot of good topsoil will be
saved. So hardy are the com-
mon green-manuring plants that
a mere scratching of the surface
soil serves to give them a start.
They do hot interfere with drain-
age, for, after the soil has been
soaked, surplus water descends
to lower levels, but takes little
soil with it. The legumes may
be cut down or will die out of
their own accord within a few
months.
Plenty of Room.
“L. de F.”; *1 have always
thought Australia was a place of
wide-open spaces, especially the
West. But “Groper” (B,
26/7/’4B), claiming that a farm
couldn’t afford space for 18in.-
wide stone fences, makes it
seem skimpy. My experience of
stone walls in windy western
districts of Victoria makes me
vote for even that much wind

shelter. You see the different
color in pasture on the lee side.
Also, there is some softening of
frost and sun. If there is good
soil under the wall plenty of
good pasture plants will reach
under from each side and help
themselves. And that strip of
soil is insulated from direct sun
evaporation. Further, the plants
get extra moisture from the
watershed of the wall. Also,
the stpne, whatever its nature, is
continually weathering down
and so adding to the soil.
Fixtures on Brick Walls.
“Radian”: What is called the
Loxin method is best for the
general run of work, Hie
Loxin comprises a centre-piece
tapered externally and
screwed internally—enclosed in
a split metal sleeve, A hole of
the correct size is drilled deep
enough to allow the Loxin to
tap in flush with face of brick or
concrete work. The fixture to be
secured is placed in position and
anchored with a standard Whit-
worth set-screw. When the screw
is tightened the centre of the
Loxin is drawn outwards, thus
expanding the sleeve until it is
dead tight in the hole.
Loxins are readily available
from hardware dealers, and
range in size from iin. to iin. in
iin. rises. The fin. size has a
rated working load of 25001 b.,
and in every size the screw will
shear before the Lpxin will
budge. While set-screws are
suitable for the smaller sizes,
standard engine-bolts or studs
make a much more substantial
job on heavier work.
Air Seeding.
“Jock”: A report from W.A.
of sowing sub.-clover seed by
air is of interest because it
quotes costs and figures. An air-
craft broadcasts sub.-clover seed
over 1600 acres in less than a
day. Flying at 300 ft., the ’plane
made runs every two chains, and
this gave a good spread. The
seed was run from a 44-gallon
drum through a funnel and tube,
the outlet being adjusted to give
the required weight of seed per
acre. The seed germinated well
and a good start was evident in
a week. The most illuminating
feature was the cost —just under
Bd. an acre.
Red Spider.
“T.F.” : Indiscriminate use of
D.D.T. is beginning to boomer-
ang. Growers in the Redlands
district (Q.) are worried by red-
spider mite, which is rapidly
reaching plague proportions.
D.D.T. has killed off its natural
enemies, leaving it unaffected. It
goes for beans and cucumbers,
sucking the sap until the plant
wilts and dies. One proprietary
spray is dynamite for bean in-
festation, but with cucumbers
the mite stays under the leaves,
making contact difficult. Until
a lure is evolved to bring them
on top of the leaves, the best
method of control is to burn off
affected crops with a flame-
thrower after the final picking.
Prospective growers for next
season would be wise to place
an order for wire-netting now;
stretch it flat on stakes about a
foot from the ground and train
the cucumbers over it. Spraying
from underneath should result
ih a good kill.
Carrying-capacity.
“Atlanta”: Despite the cut-
ting-up of large holdings and
the fact that additional country
has been made available through
improved watering facilities,
ringbarking, subdivision fencing,
better roads and transport facili-
ties, Queensland today carries
no more sheep or cattle than it
did 50 years ago.
Selections which formerly
comprised’ five large western
holdings shore in 1947 only
643.000 sheep, or 674,000 fewer
than in 1898. Sheep shorn on
the five holdings in 1898 com-
pared with 1947 shearings and
cattle held on selections which
collectively make up the resump-
tions were:
Wellshot, 365,000 (1947 figures,
125.000 sheep, 512 cattle); Bowen
Downs, 334,000 (168,000 sheep, 977
cattle); Darr River Downs, 242,000
(131,000 sheep, 311 cattle); Cambridge
Downs, 196,000 (76,000 sheep, 1770
cattle); Marathon, 180,000 (143,000
sheep, 961 cattle).
To some extent this decline
has been offset by the enor-
mous increase in average wool
yield over the past 50 years,
owing to better breeding. Re-
cords show that rainfall is no
lower than it was in 1898, and it
is doubtful if present-day stock
numbers would have been higher
if stations had been allowed to
carry on as large single hold-
ings. Evidence indicates that
the large Peak Downs sheep
freehold (C. Queensland), re-
cently taken over by the Over-
seas Food Corporation for
sorghum production, could now
carry only 30 p.c. of the sheep
numbers it carried years ago.
One suggested reason for de-
clining capacity is that sheep
have trampled the country down
so firmly that rain cannot be
absorbed, causing run-offs, ero-
sion, stoppage of springs and
silting of .watercourses. This
would result in the eating-out of
better grasses and legumes, with
subsequent propagation of use-
less grasses and weeds. In many
western pastures propagation of
valuable grasses has declined by
as much as 75 per cent. Ex-
periments with contour furrow-
ing to help arrest water run-off
already have resulted in con-
siderable improvement in growth
of valuable legumes.
Self-oiler for Hens.
“Nubis”: A “self-oiler” for
hens saves a lot of trouble when
dealing with stickfast fleas.
Construct a wooden trough with
V or semi-circular cross-section.
Depth about 6in., width about
12in., any convenient length. At
each end of the trough fix an
upright to support a longitudinal
crossbar, which runs the full
length of the trough about 9in.
above the centre. Tack some
absorbent material around the
rim of the trough and hang an-
other piece, 9in. wide, from the
crossbar, the material first being
soaked ih oil. Fill the trough a
little more than half-way with
shell-grit. When the fowls help
themselves they smear their
heads with oil.
Hints for the Farm.
“Cloudy”: In summer when
water pressure is low, keep two
44gal. drums in a central posi-
tion in the garden—a trellis will
hide them if necessary. Have
one filled with water and the
other with a weak liquid
manure. Run guttering between
the drums and the garden beds,
and ladle the water into the
gutters; use liquid manure ac-
cording to need. The drums
can be refilled from the hose at
any time.
.“Sundowner”: Seeds come
away more quickly if the boxes
are covered. Use glass or paper,
or both, but if paper see that it
is removed as soon as the seed-
lings appear. When using glass,
ventilate by placing a small piece
of board under the glass or by
turning it regularly. See that ex-
cess moisture does not accumu-
late on or near the soil surface,
as it provides a congenial en-
vironment for the development
of fungi and mosses inimical to
the growth of seeds or seedlings.
“Will C.”: One way of keep-
ing a dog’s mouth open while
dosing it without risking a nasty
bite is to put a clothes-peg or
piece of wood between the jaws.
If no emetic is available, tickling
the dog’s throat with a feather
will usually induce vomiting. By
this means I relieved a dog which
had a lump of bone stuck well
down. Also, if your dog chews
a lot of bones watch out for
bone - fragments becoming
jammed in its palate.
“Sarina”: Some of the
cypresses grow rapidly into fine
shelter- or hedge - trees in
Queensland and N.S.W. One of
the best is the Mexican cypress,
which rises to 30ft. The Ari-
zona cypress is smaller, less
spreading, but makes a good
specimen shrub. Lawsofaia grows
to 30ft., and so does Semper-
virius stricta (the pencil-pine).
Leading nurseries have them at
reasonable prices.
“Thap”: Commercial and
backyard growers of pawpaws
in south Queensland have been
worried over death of well-
grown trees and rotting of nearly-
mature fruit during last winter
and early spring. Losses have
been considerable, and Agricul-
ture Department scientists have
found that the same fungus
causes both troubles. There is
no practicable method of con-
trol, but W, Agnew, Govern-
ment horticulturalist at Nam-
bour, who has been working on
the problem for some years, has
developed a strain of rot-
resistant pawpaw of excellent
quality. However, the fixing of
die variety is a slow process, and
it will be some time yet, before
seeds are generally available.
“M.”: Mulching the vegetable
beds with rotted manure, com-
post or lawn clippings in the hot
months helps retain soil moisture
and prevents burning of the sur-
face roots. It also keeps down
the weeds.
“Radian”: Before cutting a
new belt to exact length it
should be weighted at the ends
and hung over a convenient
rafter for a few days. This pro-
cess stretches the belt and often
saves the annoyance of taking-
up slack after the first few hours
of running.


lay in ambush thereabouts, re-
turn to the log.
DUT there were mornings
'' that were more realistic ;
mornings not so quiet, when
there’d be laughter and fun and
“everybody up Jules’s way must
be off their head” ; when Horsy
Kitty Poulton would be over
seeing Susan; and Joe Kelton,
too. Horsy Kitty, as she was
known in the district, was a
chestnut herself, and generally
knocked about in her riding rig-
out, which showed off to ad-
vantage ( her rather figure-eight
figure, with emphasis on the
lower circle of the eight.
She used to ride her horse at
the different shows and always
carried her riding-whip about
with her, and, force of habit
maybe, used to flick herself
lightly across her own hind-
quarters every now and then
while talking. It was said of
her that she believed in calling
a spade a spade, and she some-
times said things that shocked.
As for Joe Kelton ; he had a
reputation for being funny, and
for his dancing.
Horsy Kitty had nearly be-
come engaged to Will Locking-
ton, but had broken it off when
she discovered that he was also
hanging round Myrtle Tregow-
than at the Red Gum Hotel at
Cauliflower Creek. After that
she was pretty thick with young
Hallett, and the district thought
she’d be marrying him, but
Kitty heard something about
young Hallett and Myrtle Tre-
gowthan of the Red Gum Hotel
at Cauliflower Creek. Then she
actually became engaged to Dick
Pendleton, but when she saw
Dick Pendleton kissing Myrtle
Tregowthan of the Red Gum
Hotel at Cauliflower Creek,
broke it off with him, and, after
taking her whip to Bill Boake
for saying he’d seen her sitting
on old man Pendleton’s knee,
she was now showing her figure-
eight mostly to Tom Sutherland,
left-hander and son of Grasper
Sutherland, owner of Pride of
Avon, champion bull for at
least two miles around.
P'jN this particular morning,
and while Tom -Sutherland,
Joe Kelton, Archie Rankin and
another chap were yarning with
Jules on the log, and Horsy
Kitty < was inside talking to
Susan, Susan’s fowls, evidently
imagining that they were pul-
lets again, began to scamper and
flutter about outrageously and
flirtatiously, cackling and cluck-
ing and taking to the air for
short excited flights, as if the
devil himself had got hold of
them. With all this fuss, the old
rooster, who was down the pad-
dock, came running up to join
his harem, evidently thinking
that his wives were in gay and
giddy mood. So, eyeing-off a
young pullet (the only one) who
was just reaching an attractive
age, he began to scratch up
imaginary titbits for her and call
to her like a crooner, and the
young pullet hearing his roman-
tic invitation to dinner trotted
over to him, whereupon the
rogue pretended to take a bite of
the food that did not exist and,
as she bent down to inspect the
succulent morsel, dropped his
wing to her ; at which the young
hen stuck her beak high in the
air and left him flat, evidently
telling him in her own way that
she was awake-up to him.
“There you are, chaps,” said
Joe Kelton, who was supposed
to know a lot about women.
“What happened just then goes
to prove that a man who thinks
he is going to make love to a
woman after inviting her to
dinner and misses out on the
dinner is a mug.” Joe waved
a wide arm. “They’re all the
same, whether they’re women or
hens.”
Much loud laughter greeted
these wise and erudite remarks,
and over in the house Horsy
Kitty said to Susan, “There
they go; men laughing. Ever
notice, Suse, that when men
laugh like that, with that sort
of low chuckle in it, they’re
mostly saying something low.”
“Oh,” said Susan.
Then Kitty whispered some-
thing to Susan.
“Oh, Kitty!” said Susan.
“You do say such terrible
things.” But Susan, much as
she would have preferred to
look shocked, burst out laugh-
ing, and Kitty joined in most
heartily.
“'"P KINGS are lively this
A morning,” said Joe Kelton.
“Women in the house laughing
fit to burst their stays, the hens
gone mad and”
Before he could finish his
remarks, and —as if also catch-
ing the spirit of the fine morn-
ing ; or if not that, maybe in
reply to Horsy Kitty’s also horsy
laughter and Susan’s loud ac-
companiment—old Duke threw
his head up, propped his ears
as arrogantly as he could, flung
into the air like a champion
what tail he had, snorted, and
endeavored to gallop gallantly
and gaily as if giving an imper-
sonation of a wild and fiery
stallion.
This brave and spirited show
of aged exhibitionism was
accompanied by the usual Sab-
bath rudeness much favored by
well-fed working horses when
having their Sunday off. But
suddenly a violent rumbling or
knocking could be heard occur-
ring somewhere within the depths
of Duke’s inside, and his furious
galloping came down to the
level of a trot, and then the trot
to a rather heavy walk, with
Duke now looking as if he had
the heaves, the gripes or the
strangles. Dropping his old
head again, he plodded over to
the company of a tree and
promptly fell asleep.
And it was probably Joe Kel-
ton cheering Duke on as he
careered round the paddock that
brought the bull calf into the
high hilarity of things and made
it go off like a packet of
crackers: bucking, backbending,
side-jumping, leaping and pig-
rooting ; almost turning somer-
saults and going on like a
March hare. And while this
temperamental burst was, going
on Joe Kelton applauded each
burst and Archie Rankin ac-
companied the prancing, danc-
ing calf on his mouth-organ with
a most invigorating accom-
paniment.
AFTER the calf had finished
its display, Archie Rankin
still kept on playing his mouth-
organ, and in the temporary lull
that settled over things Tom
Sutherland then asked Joe
Kelton to do his dance.
“Yes,” said Archie Rankin.
“Come on, Joe. Dance the
Dying Grasshopper again.”
Joe had danced the Dying
Grasshopper all over the district,
and with Archie Rankin now
providing another suitable ac-
companiment Joe began his
dance, and his appreciative
audience cheered him on ; while
from the house out came Horsy
Kitty, slapping herself on her
bottom with her riding-whip as
she came; and she, too, now
began to prance and dance
about, whereupon Tom Suther-
land jumped up and asked her to
dance the Sick Bandicoot with
him, and, amid much laughter,
there was Joe dancing his Dying
Grasshopper and Tom and Kitty
dancing their Sick Bandicoot.
But they had no sooner
finished their capers when Susan
herself stepped forward and said
that they could all have their
dying grasshopper and their sick
bandicoot, she liked something
live, and, with that, she grabbed
hold of the hem of her skirt and
petticoat, gave a kick and said,
“The creek in flood,” and off
she started, with Archie Rankin
again providing an accompani-
ment with as much suggestion of
flood in it as he could manage.
And now, in the swish and the
rustle of Susan’s old grey petti-
coat, floodwaters tossed and
rose as the old petticoat and
dress rose higher and higher and
swirled about the white banks
of the flesh of Susan’s lilywhite
legs.
WHEN it was all over and
Kitty had galloped gaily
off, with Tom Sutherland sitting
behind her with his hands
pressed firmly on her shoulders
and his cheek leaning danger-
ously near hers, the rest of the
visitors gone, and Susan back
in the house setting the table
for dinner, Jules sat alone on
the log, and every now and
his face spread into a wide grin.
“The dying grasshopper!” he
said, smiling.
Beside him sat Slinks with his
nose held as if he were a con-
noisseur taking a reflective and
quizzical smell of all the smells
that were combined in one suc-
culent whole; the perfume of
the years’ fowls’, ducks’ and
rabbits’ heads, insides, feet and
legs; together with the years’
beef, mutton and poultry bones
and the blood that had been
shed when all these creatures
had lost their heads on the
family chopping-block, which
was the log, now all rotted back
into the sweet earth, the rich
effluvium from which, drawn
out by the sun, came up from
the steaming earth in fragrant
whiffs for Slinks to enjoy.
“The sick bandicoot,” said
Jules, chuckling.
And now. Slinks, having had
his appetiser, put both paws out
before him and, setting his head
down evenly between them,
breathed out a great sigh of
contentment, and after that the
only movement that came from
him was when Jules would again
chuckle; then, with every
chuckle, his tail would tap, tap
the ground as an accompani-
ment.
“The creek in flood!” said
Jules. “He, he, he! The creek
in flood! He, he, he! An*
fancy Susan! Everybody seeing
her white legs an’ her stockings
tied up with string!”
listen to this bloke. Expects him
to buy him drinks, too.
To throw off the tout he slips
out of the pub to get tobacco.
Suddenly he thinks, what about
Daise? He ought to get her
something. In the end he
chooses a box of fancy choco-
lates done up in red cellophane.
Then he buys an evening paper
and takes it back to the pub, go-
ing into the private bar this
time, to study the racing form.
• -
AT five when the counter-
lunch is brought out he has
another beer and scrambles with
the crowd for sausage-rolls and
mussels and cheese. He doesn’t
do badly, eating his fill and
drinking several more beers, so
that it seems no time before the
barman is singing out, “Time,
gentlemen! Time, please!”
Slightly fuddled, he’s soon
shunted out the street-door with
his drinking mates, who, gar-
rulous and sentimental, try to
detain him. But he eludes them
all.
He’s very happy and devil-
may-care now. At first in the
bar he had had a guilty feeling,
but after a few drinks he told
himself not to be a damn’ fool.
Why should he slink home every
Friday early like a lapdog?
Wasn’t he boss? Sure he was!
Well, he’d have his fun whenever
he wanted to. He wouldn’t let
any woman make a fool of him.
Ah! Here’s the kitchen-door
of the Golden Gate. One of
the girls spots him mooching
around.
“Your boy-friend on the prowl
again, Daisy,” she calls.
*AII right. Half a mo.”
Presently she slips out dolled
up in her street-clothes and a
light summer coat. Bill Judd
reckons she looks swell.
“Come on,” she says, taking
his arm. “Let’s get away from
here.”
“Where’ll we go, Daise?” he
asks hesitatingly.
“What about the park?”
“Sure thing! The park’s O.K.
with me.” He tells himself it’s
going to be easier than he
thought.
J T’S getting dusk when they
* climb the warm grassy slope
dotted with shrubs and trees.
They giggle at the funny way
other couples scuttle like rabbits
about the slope, out of the lights,
under the trees.
At last they find a snug possy
of their own, side by side be-
neath the drooping fronds of a
phcenix-palm.
Bill Judd wonders whether she
expects him to be tough or senti-
mental. He feels the hard
comery shape of the chocolate-
box in his pocket between them.
He tugs it out.
“Here’s some chocs, Daise.”
“Oh, ta!” She rips the cello-
phane, opens the box, and eats
two creamies before she thinks
to offer him any.
She sniffs. “You been booz-
ing, Bill? Didn’t you bring any
beer along?”
“Well,” he excuses himself
weakly. “To tell the truth, I
didn’t think of it.”
“Oh, well, I really shouldn’t
touch it —now.” She sighs as if
remembering a sadness.
DOLD with the beer and the
*—* excitement of the time and
the place he puts an arm around
her to draw her to him. Her
slowness annoys him.
“Don’t you ever show more
interest in a feller?” he com-
plains,
“Oh, don’t, Bill,” she says,
sitting up straight and pushing
him away. “I guess I’ve got to
tell you now.” She sighs
theatrically.
“What is it, Daise?” he asks
anxiously.
“Don’t you see how it is with
me, Bill?”
“No,” he says, confused and
startled, “What, Daise?”
“Oh, you can’t ever notice
nothing. Bill, if you can’t notice
me. I’ll have to go away for a
while, in a couple of months or
so. That’s how good it is.”
This news flusters Bill Judd
properly.
“Isn’t it awful. Bill?”
It is awful. Makes Bill Judd
sit up straight too. It has spoilt
the party all right. He curses
himself for being such a fool.
But he never notices women like
that.
“Oh, I didn’t know, Daise,”
he says weakly.
Daisy is speaking falteringly.
“The boss told me I got to
always please the customers or I
get the sack. It’s always the
poor honest working-girl,” she
says sorrowfully.
He twiddles, with a sticky
chocolate-paper. This sort of a
scene makes a feller sick. His
one thought is to get away from
here quick.
“Too right, it’s too bad, Daisy.
Them kind of bosses ought to be
showed up,” he comforts her
coldly and mechanically, think-
ing hard.
But he can’t help hearing
Daisy’s whining voice. “You al-
ways looked so kind. Bill. Dif-
ferent from that sort. You never
wanted to take a girl out like
that. I thought you’d under-
stand.”
HE wishes he were miles away,
wishes he Were home, and at
the same time he has a sinking
feeling when he pictures his late
arrival home.
“If you could help a girl just
a little.”
“Sure, Daisy, I’ll help—if I
can—you know how it is”
“You see, I got to go away for
a while. A little money would
help a lot, Bill.”
“Well, yes, I’d like to,, Daisy,
but you know how it is with a
working-chap—and a wife —and
kids. You see how things
are”
“Oh, Bill! I didn’t know you
was a married man. But just a
fiver would do,”
A fiver! He’s very much
aware of the thick roll of notes,
to pay the rates, in the wallet in
his inside pocket. He purposely
didn’t settle the rates so as to
have enough for his fun.
“Look here, Daisy, I’d give
you a fiver if I could. Honest I
would. You don’t know the
bills I paid today! But I won’t
see a girl made to suffer. Gosh,
1 won’t!”
f"AREFULLY he fishes out
his wallet, clutching it tight.
In a fever of haste and disgust
he feels for a loose note, all the
time trying to hide how much
I is in the wallet.
\ “Here, take this, Daisy.”
He pulls out one note and two
more fall on the ground in a
pool of light from the street-
lamp. Too late to cover them
before Daisy scoops them up.
He scrambles to his feet.
“Look here, I got to go. I’ll miss
the last bus. You’ll get a chill
here, Daisy. You ought to be
home, wrapped up, you ought.”
Coldly he helps her up, her
box of chocolates clutched in
one hand. They hurry down the
grassy slope. At the park gates
he mumbles a goodbye, and
runs.
Discomforted and furious with
himself he makes his way
through the dark back streets to
his car.
ALTHOUGH he rattled hell
ou t of the old car it was
fully nine o’clock when he drove
through his gate and into the
shed.
Flora came to the house
door.
“Well, Bill Judd, whatever you
been up to?”
“Oh, a burnt-out bearing,
dear. Had to wait for repairs.”
She walked up to the car. 1
“You smell of beer strong
enough to bum out more than
bearings.”
He turned away, pulling out
the empty egg crates.
“How much money’s gone
west today, I’d like to know?”
she snapped.
“Well, perhaps I better let
Fred do the carting to town in
future, dear. The old car’s get-
ting a bit unreliable.”
“I’ll say!”
Bill Judd half hoped to escape
with that. But inside in the
lamplight it began.
“Gosh! Where’d you get
that kind of a shirt? You do
look a gawk! And you’ve had
a city haircut too. Poof! You
reek of beer. And what’s this?
Looks like chocolate on your
pants. Who you been out with,
Bill Judd? Did you pay the
rates? Where’s the receipt?
Come on, let me see it... ”
BACK at the Golden Gate
Nell asks Daisy how she got
on with her boy-friend. “Did
things go like you told me?” she
asks.
“Oh, it was a perfect scream,
Nell. You should’ve seen him in
the park. Here, have a choc.”
“Ta, Daise. Gee! I’d have
loved to see youse. Did he
swallow the yarn?”
“He swallowed the whole
caboodle like you’re swallowing
that choc., Nell. Believed every-
thing I tell him. I know his
sort.”
“And did he fork out?”
“Three quid, Nell. We go
shopping tomorrow, you and me,
Nell. He only meant to hand
me one, but he dropped two
more and I got them too. Not
so bad, eh?”
“What if he finds out, Daise?”
“Don’t you worry! He'll never
show his ugly face in here
again.”

Seaside Cottage.
Living in the backwaters of a
seaside lagoon, a friend, taking
his holidays, was kind enough to
lend me The Breakers while he
was away. On arrival we found
that he had pinned a very illu-
minating note on the front-door.
Here it is:
Dear Plop: Knowledge of
the following should make your
stay a happy one:
1. —The dinghy moored to
the bank may at first appear to
ship dangerous quantities of
water. It is, however, quite
safe for fishing provided you
bail steadily with one hand. If
you desire to mend it, I have
placed the necessary caulking,
pitch, planks, etc., in the boat,
2. —As you will observe, the
front lawn has been getting
away from me—work and
worry, I suppose, and the
mower is out of action. But, as
the wife always says, “Plop
should have been an engineer,
he’s so clever with his hands.”
So, old man, if you could get
the mower going and give her a
brief trim, I’d be obliged. Any
time before you leave.
3. —While we’re on mechanics,
the electric-stove could, do with
a spot of tinkering. It just
doesn’t seem to work. Some-
thing with the wiring. The
primus, is out, too, likewise the
chip-heater, kitchen-tap, most
power-points, radio. The ice-
chest leaks—slightly. Plenty of
tools, if you can find them.
Well, old man, the only other
thing is Horace, the billygoat,
tethered at the side of the house.
He keeps the lantana down.
Noxious —the lantana not
Horace. After a couple of days
would you move him around to
the patch outside the bedroom-
window? In time you will find
his natural aroma quite O.K.
Happy times, —George.
Unfortunately, the younger
Plop picked this threshold-
crossing moment to blossom out
in measles spots —we had to get
him home. I left a note for
George saying how 1 sorry we
were and sped home, with no-
where to turn my aptitude but
opening bottled beer from the
refrigerator, which functions
admirably.
Plop.

lish to which there is no rhyme are

“Plastic surgeon Dr. Robert Alan
Franklyn predicted this week that a
woman would soon be able to get
a new face in a few hours.”

All credit to the plastic surgeon
Who on an ageing wrinkled
face
Can now make pristine beauty
burgeon
And youthful bloom resume

So, if you must, seek his
attentions
And with your newly-grafted
gloss
Win love instead of condescen-
sion
From handsome swain or
wealthy boss.
Yet why resort at all to plastic
Discomfort and a money slug
When woman’s wiles and means
less drastic
Can win you any day a mug ?

Old Bore’s Almanack for
1949.
Jan. : The Chinese Nationalist
General Hang Soon will sell all his
American ammunition to the Com-
munist General Bing Sing Long, who
on finding that it doesn’t fit his
Russian guns will be compelled to
sell it back to Hang Soon at cut
rates. Under its amenity scheme,
the Joint Coal Board will make a
gift to each miner pf an electric hair-
clipper ; incensed, the Hairdressers’
Union will immediately declare the
Coal Board black and the miners
will declare a general strike in sym-
pathy with the hairdressers. One
of the Soviet hierarchy who has often
been described as a confidant of
Stalin and his possible successor will
die of heart-failure, and - a strange
feature will be that his body will
weigh slightly more immediately after
death than it did immediately before.
Feb.: The proud disclosure by
“Izveslia” that Stalin has now de-
cided to change his socks twice a
month will be interpreted by “circles
close to the White House” as a strong
hint to America not to interfere in the
Chinese Uncivil War. In answer to
an Opposition question Mr. Chifley
will admit that he has read a news-
paper item. A Sydney magistrate,
warning that the increasing incidence
of hit-run driving will compel him to
adopt stem measures to suppress it,
Will fine an offender 15s. and costs,
and will threaten to double the fine
should he appear before him again.
A Federal “Labor” M.P. will suffer
a kinked neck through sleeping un-
comfortably on the shoulder of a
colleague throughout a vital debate
on defence, and Caucus will imme-
diately consider amending the Parlia-
mentary pension to £l5 a week in
view of this extra risk to members’
health. Mr. Daly will ask a question
in the House without first being
primed by Mr. Haylen.
March: Following the signing of
a special reconciliation Pact of
Friendship between the Soviet and
Yugoslavia,' Marshal Tito’s Belgrade
Radio will launch a scorching attack
on the “Mangy Stalinist dogs of the
Cominform.” In the N.S.W. Assem-
bly the Premier, granted leave to in-
troduce legislation which he will
describe as “urgent and of vital im-
portance to the State,” will go straight
ahead with the first reading of the
Gaming and Betting (Amendment)
Act, wmch will “streamline” machinery
for the quick hearing of appeals in
dog-doping cases. A Jacksonville
(Fla.) soda-jerk will win a local Worst
Voice competition, and he will be
pounced on by a Hollywood talent
“ Off-hand , I'd say split personality .”
scout and be given a 100,000 dollars-
a-year contract to croon in films.
April : A spokesman for the Com-
bined Women’s Organisations will
declare that women, especially middle-
aged ones, will emphatically refuse
to follow the new Parisian skirts-to-
the-knees fashion. A Sydney news-
paper will launch a Most Glamorous
Grandmother competition, and the
photo, of the first entrant will be that
of a 75-year-old platinum blonde
taken at the wheel of her motor-
bike in revealing sweater, coolie pants
and beanie. The N.S.W. Minister for
Transport, opening a new Road
Safety Week, will appeal for greater
caution by motorists and pedestrians.
A famous Soviet scientist will invent
the cigarette-lighter. The British
Labor party will pass a resolution
deploring that there are so few parts
of the Empire left to give away. 'A
Jap spokesman will demand that
Japsti be given the democratic right
to build ten new super-aircraft-
carriers so that it may defend itself
against a possible attack by New
Zealand.
May : A prominent churchman will
make a strong appeal to keep the
spirit of sordid commercialism out
of Mother’s Day. Road deaths in
N.S.W. and Victoria during April
will set a new all - time - high
record. Under its amenity scheme
the Joint Coal Board will make
a free issue to miners pf pansy
seed, polo ponies, records of
complete symphonies, swami pyjamas
and model aeroplanes, and will instal
totes at all mines to provide betting
facilities for midweek racing. The
spokesman for a big city store will
estimate that 98 p.c. of all women
are now wearing the new knee-length
skirts. In Parliament “Labor’s’
Golden - voiced Orator, Senator
Hashley, will trip over a couple of
“g’s” and suffer a compound frac-
ture of his speech. A Hollywood
horse opera will be described by its
studio only as “stupendously colossal,
and this deprecation of its opus will
lead to the studio making a big
shake-up in its publicity staff. Some-
one will quote a Sydney “Daily
Telegraph” leader. Women’s new
spring hats will fit snugly oyer the
left car.
JUNE: The Retail Traders’ Asso-
ciation will announce that the turnover
for Mother’s Day trading exceeded that
of last year by over £500,000. The
pilot of a supersonic-speed plane
will leave London in time to have
the day-before’s breakfast in New
York, Green lipstick will appear on
the market to match the complexions
of women cigar-smokers. Eddie Ward
will abolish by regulation the use
of the term “taubada” previously
used by natives on the ground that
it humiliated the natives by giving
them an inferiority complex; natives
in future will be permitted to greet
their white employers with “Good-
day, mate,” or “Howsit, comrade?”
A Melbourne man will agree to act
again as judge of a baby show. Talk-
ing with a strong American accent,
the distinguished visitor Dr. H. V.
Evatt will tell reporters on his arrival
by specially-chartered airliner that he
considers Australians have the finest
leaders and climate and the best tax-
payers in the world.
July: The Italian-built battleship
October-Revolution will lose a pro-
peller, and the Soviet Navy’s summer
manoeuvres in the North Pacific will
have to be abandoned owing to the
necessity of waiting for a new screw
to be cast in Italy. Pumpkin will
sell in Sydney at Is. 9d. a pound
and representatives of growers, middle-
men and retailers will declare that
with the prevailing ruinous prices they
face imminent bankruptcy. The
Treacle Marketing Board will just
finish spending £50,000 on a nation-
wide publicity campaign to popularise
treacle-pudding when it will discover
that there is a serious shortage of
treacle, and it will immediately launch
another expensive publicity campaign
to depopularise treacle-pudding. A
man will declare his belief that the
taxation cuts just announced by the
Prime Minister were not influenced
by the imminence of tjie Federal
elections, and after examination he
will be released from the Reception
House.
August : A spokesman for the
motor trade will reveal that there is
an unprecedented demand by vege-
table-growers, -agents and -retailers
for new American luxury cars. Reply-
ing to a charge by “Pro Bono
Publico” that his critiques are begin-
ning to show flashes of lucidity, the
“S. M. Herald’s” art critic will con-
tend that “the introspectional ultimate
of pure objectivist criticism is not
incompatible with the three-dimen-
sional positiveness of grotesquerie or
the inhibitions inherent in an orderly
survey of the illuminative panorama
suggested by pedagogic metagenesis
and the .base materialism so inimical
to the broad basis of modernist art.”
A Hollywood star the day after her
divorce will marry the grandfather
of ber ex-husband, who will then
marry his divorced wife’s divorced
mother. Flying saucers passing
through an atomic cloud will be
observed from the Swiss Alps.
Sept.: Despite every effort by the
Potato Board, there will be plenty of
potatoes in all the capital cities for
everyone. N.S.W. Premier McGirr
will exultantly announce that the
State Lotteries have now displaced
heavy industry, wool and wheat as
the most important phase of the
State's activities, and that some of
the now-surplus labor from those in-
dustries will be employed as queue-
stackers in the Lottery Office. Pro-
fessor Crankoff, the celebrated Soviet
agrostonomer, will announce that he
has succeeded in evolving wheat
plants which cannot be flattened by
hail, as they grow along the ground.
To the end of the month 1,750,000
tons of coal will have been lost
through Communist-inspired strikes,
and Mr. Chifley will send a special
message of thanks to the miners “for
the magnificent work you are doing
under trying circumstances.”
Oct, : A Joseph Chamberlain will
be fined for working the employees
of his backyard handbag factoiy a
60-hour-week without overtime, and
it will transpire that he is a Polish
refugee whose real name is Mzinski
Mzsmoklyze. A centenarian inter-
viewed by the Brisbane “Courier-
Mail” will declare that he feels lousy
and will attribute this to the fact that
he’s not allowed by his doctor to
have any beer; he will express the
hope that someone “will knock him
on the head with a cricket-bat." After
a chase at 80 m.p.h. through suburban
streets, thieves will reduce the stolen
car to matchwood in a collision with
a brickwall and won’t suffer a scratch.
Sydney’s tram shortage will be further
aggravated when the paint that has
been holding 1902-built footboard
trams together collapses.
Nov.: When the member for a
country electorate moves the adjourn-
ment of the House so that urgent
consideration may be given to the
vital outback problem of fly-strike
a city “Labor” member will declare
that the time of the House shouldn’t
be wasted on a subject like trout-
fishing. A decision of world-impor-
tance in American foreign policy will
be pushed on to the inside pages of
Sydney afternoon papers because it
coincides with the release of a de-
cision on a horse-ring-in appeal case.
Seamen will threaten to tie up all
ships on the Australian coast unless
the brand of perfume approved by
the union for use in seamen’s state-
rooms is supplied by shipowners. A
man who owns a garage will be fined
for using his bench on a Saturday
afternoon to adjust his own lawn-
mower.
Dec.: Dr. .Evatt will express his
entire satisfaction at the fact that the
28 million words spoken at the U.N.O.
General Assejnbly for the year worked
out as low as two dollars 50 cents
a word. The N.S.W. Minister for
Housing will proudly announce that
of the 2500 houses put up by the
Housing Commission only 1100 were
converted Army huts and sheds. Mr.
McGirr will announce that the differ-
ence between the 2500 and the 30,000
he promised will be overtaken next
year. The Jap Premier will declare that
Japan’s new co-prosperity scheme
will have as its initial aim peace with
everyone. A U.S. State Dept, official
will reveal that he got his first inkling
of what U.S. foreign policy really
was from a Russian diplomat. Fol-
lowing a new Pact of Friendship be-
tween Rumania and Hungary ordered
by the Kremlin, frontier guards be-
tween the two countries will be
doubled.

“Joseph Vitelli explained to doctors
that he had shot himself in the
stomach to take his mind off a tooth-
ache.” — Sydney “Sunday Telegraph
The Bard of Avon, be it noted.
Has down the centuries been
quoted
Concerning the futility
Of thinking that philosophy
Can overcome an aching tooth;
And, recognising this as truth.
Each sufferer has sought a way
Of dealing promptly with decay
By means apart from wishful
thinking.
Some visit dentists, many, shrink-
ing
From thoughts of filling and
extraction.
Take other queer but helpful
action;
But surely he who sought relief
In stomach pain from dental
grief
Found that his cure, instead of
taking
Effect, just left him bellyaching.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid

Australian Standards
“The thing that strikes me about Aus-
tralia,” an intelligent Englishwoman who
arrived here eight months ago said to me,
“is that in nearly everything the second-
best is good enough.” It was not a new
criticism, of course, but it is a point of
view which we might well begin to chal-
lenge, especially as more and more people
from the outside world are coming here,
ready to form quick and perhaps damag-
ing judgments.
The truer approach would be to con-
sider, not where we lag by English, Ameri-
can or European standards, but what we
have achieved despite the great disparity
in the way of life which climatic con-
ditions make possible in the respective
regions. In Sydney and Melbourne I had
often thought how easily the Australian
temperament adjusted itself to and ex-
cused itself by the second-rate, but when
I came to Queensland, closer to the
climatic frontiers between comfortable
and onerous living, I began to resent the
complacent criticism of people who fail to
see the Australian scene in realistic terms.
There is, indeed, too much that is
second-rate in Queensland, too many pro-
jects left half-completed, too much of
the wait-a-while attitude, too much of the
“it’ll-do” improvisation. But I also be-
gan to see something of what the Aus-
tralian spirit and the Australian culture
have established' in northern Australia,
and something of what, in its own way,
it will yet achieve; so I have reached
the conclusions that Australians should
begin to understand' themselves better,
and that migrants should seriously be
taught something of the difference be-
tween Australia and their homeland.
A glance at the map shows what this
means. Every important focal point in
world civilisation, especially our modern
“white” civilisation, lies north of the
Tropic of Cancer in the temperate zones ;
but a large part of Queensland lies north
of the Tropic of Capricorn, well inside
the tropical zone, while the tropical in-
fluence extends well southward to and be-
yond Brisbane. The significant fact is
that nowhere else in the world has a
white culture of any importance sought
to establish itself within the tropical zone.
When this thought strikes, one’s way of
looking at Australia undergoes a com-
plete change.
Then, achievements represented in
building white man’s cities, white man’s
industries, a white man’s way of life, look
rather different. We see a struggle against
climatic odds —the fiercest and most im-
placable enemies civilisation has ever had
to face—and we begin to understand the
paved streets and well-kept shops of
Rockhampton and Townsville, the tree-
fringed roads of many northern towns,
the hospitals, cool homes, bowling greens,
cricket pitches; the men sweating in the
canefields, white men at a black man s
industry ; the wharflaborers of Bowen,
Cairns and Mackay.; the rising factories ;
the musical societies, dramatic groups and
the like—that these all represent not
something “second-rate” or “second-
best,” but a mighty conquest of an alien
world of' drenching, enervating, killing
heat. , , . , ,
By this 1 reasoning it is simply absurd
to bring Old-World conceptions of
quality, of niceness, of rightness, and
to set them square for comparative pur-
poses against what-the Australian spirit
has wrought. Every step forward is a
gain; it should not be measured against
ideal standards, but by the standards of
what went before and what the tropics
have done to white civilisation almost
everywhere else in the world.
It is true, of course, that our external
way of life too readily invites comparison.
We have still to learn how to live in a
tropical br semi-tropical climate. Our
food, clothing, conventional habits, work-
ing practices have all been lifted, more
or less in one lump, from a traditional
English background.
We have, in Queensland at any rate, to
learn to dress with conventional decency
but according to unconventional ideas ;
to recast our food-regimen; to recon-
struct even our working lives. There is
no real reason why the working day in a
Queensland winter, with its soft and pleas-
ing warmth, should not be longer than the
working day in a gruelling Queensland
summer; or why work should not begin
at 7 a.m. in summer and finish by early
afternoon; or even in all possible indus-
tries close down for a month or so,
making the lost time up in the bearable
wjnter weather. — Dee (Q.).
Passing of Country Towns
One essential “amenity” residents can-
not provide to attract population to their
towns (B. 17/11/’4B) is an adequate rail
service. Few people travel to and from
country towns by train if they can help
it. With woefully few exceptions,
country trains are slow, dirty and un-
comfortable, and the farther you go
from the city the worse they become.
In N.S.W. every time. the coal re-
sources have to be conserved, the first
step is to cut the country trains. On most
lines they have now been cut to three
days a week for so long that I am ex-
pecting any day to have “Old-timer”
boast that he remembers when there was
a daily service.
This inefficiency and insufficiency of
rail transport is a major cause of both
the drift from the country towns and
their failure tp attract an increasing popu-
lation. Given swift, comfortable and
reasonably cheap travel facilities, people
would be happy to live in the more
serene atmosphere of the *country add
merely visit the city from time to time.
But with travel so inconvenient they—
often regretfully—seize the first oppor-
tunity to shift to the place where all the
advantages of civilisation are within a
short tram ride.
The attracting of fresh population de-
pends principally on establishment of
industries to give employment,; but in-
dustrialists will not dump new factories in
places to which it takes weeks to get
materials delivered or send back manu-
factured goods (not to mention transport
charges which put them at a dis-
advantage with city competitors), or
where, thanks to the inadequacy of
the rail service, the arrival of mails is so
erratic as to be quite undependable.
The housing shortage is frequently
cited as the main curb on the growth
of country towns, but that is a recent and
temporary condition. Moreover, human-
ity has shown time and again that, when
it responds to a mass urge to move, it is
not discouraged by difficulties; it over-
comes them. When, if ever, the drift
from the cities sets in, the people will go,
and tfye country towns will grow. But
unless fear of atomic disaster to the
crowded city starts it, I cannot imagine
any great migration inland until country
and coast are linked by a swift and re-
liable system of communications. — Hist

The Balts
Bathurst (N.S.W.) sees them coming
and going—hundreds moving out as a
similar number move in. Occasionally
more than 2000 are in residence, stay for
a few weeks and then go out to various
jobs all over Australia. Visitors from
Bathurst frequently go out to the camp
aqd are entertained by the Balts or take
forms of entertainment to them. The
hospitality is always very warmly re-
ceived. Many of them are regu-
larly in Bathurst. They attend pictures
and concerts, and take part in entertain-
ments. A group of their menfolk who
play chess have had frequent tourneys
“I'm tellin' yer, taxation's makin' people so poor a man's got to work
overtime to earn an honest living these days."
with local players. They are intensely
musical, and quite a few have talent of
very high quality.
In practically every instance they have
shown a keen desire to adopt, wholly and
completely, our national ideas and ideals.
What impressed more than anything else
was the singing of the National Anthem
—our King to be theirs also. It is an
inspiring thought. They want to be
taught cricket and football; they want to
sing “Waltzing Matilda,” Crowds visit
the technological museum—to study Aus-
tralian birds and animals, specimens of
Australian wool, coal, various kinds of
timber and minerals. They walk through
our parks and study the names of the
trees. They are most anxious to learn.
Most of them can speak English fairly
well, and some have three or four
languages. They are clean and tidy in
their habits, and many of them display
a desire for beauty.
All appear to be anxious to work. It has
been said that our selection has been
made from the softer class—artists,
students and professionals, rather than
from the manual laborers. This is not
altogether correct, Tor all classes are well
represented. One in camp at present
time is a doctor, formerly a member of
Rotary in Europe. He visited Bathurst
Rotary Club and gave an address, in
which he expressed thankfulness, for the
opportunity of coming to Australia, and
said he would gladly do pick-and-
shovel work for a couple of years in
anticipation of the wider and better out-
look thereafter. That appears to be the
spirit dominating the majority of them.
They have had such a gruelling time in
Europe that they are now bubbling over
with enthusiasm to make good under the
new conditions. They should be given
every possible encouragement.—C. E. T.

Disappointed! Newcomer
I am an immigrant of the white-collar
class, married, with two young children ;
fully employed at £lO per week, After a
desperate search the only habitation I
could find was a flat at £4 per week. My
next-door neighbors are elderly, living in
their own comfortable cottage on their
combined old-age pensions of £4 ss. per
week.
My financial position is worse than
theirs. After deducting rent, tram-fares,
union-fees, etc., the balance is actually
less than the o.a,p. Yet for this pittance
I must work hard, and on it I must sup-
port four people, provide for a rainy day
and keep up appearances.
We paid our own fares, missed two
months of earning-time between giving
up one job and finding another, and spent
a considerable sum on hotel charges be-
fore finding the flat. I want to buy a
house on the instalment plan, but I am
told that at least a year will pass before
one will be available. Meantime my sav-
ings are disappearing, and soon I will be
unable to place a deposit even when (or
if) a house is offered.
The climate is ideal, food is plentiful
at a price, working hours are short, and
Australians are kindly and hospitable.
But is it surprising if my wife and I are
a bit homesick as we think of the home
we sold up, the secure position we left,
and the cash we have expended, as we
face a future of poverty in a land of
plenty?— Had It (S.A.),
Tuppenny-road
In these days of dependence upon
Government grants, the people of Port
Macquarie (N.S.W.) show remarkable
self-reliance in local affairs. Some years
ago the mouth of the Hastings silted up
so badly it made the bar impassable to
coastal steamers, and the town lost its
importance as a port. The climate, how-
ever, made it an ideal tourist resort, and,
with the opening of the Oxley Highway,
residents of the New England district
sought refuge at. Port Macquarie from
the severe winter weather.
As well as river-fishing and boating,
there is a splendid ocean beach—Flynn’s
Beach —about a mile out of town. Here,
in an attractive bush setting, a business-
man from Sydney began the construc-
tion of Beach Park, a group of modern
auto-cabins with an adjoining cafd. But
the road ran along the crest of a ridge of
rich, red soil, and approach to the sand
was only by way of precipitous path-
ways, with no parking space for visiting
cars at beach-level.
The proprietor of one of the local
hotels placed a box in the bar and asked
all who bought cigarettes (lOd. a packet
at the time) to throw in the tuppence
change out of a shilling towards the cost
of the required road. In a surprisingly
short time enough money was collected,
and now a graded, dark-red gravel horse-
shoe leads downwards to the edge of
the sand. It’s called Tuppenny-road, —
Macmar (N.S.W.).
The Snowy Water
So much rubbish has been written
about the conflicting interests of the four
Governments on watyer diversion that I
feel impelled to point out that the most
vociferous agitators are those who live in
districts with an assured water supply, or
in irrigation areas. There is no way of
understanding the problem of irrigation
and power production without a basic
knowledge of the river system. At an
inter-State conference at Albury about
three years ago one of the leading men
in the Victorian Water Commission said
the Murray Valley extended from the
borders of Queensland to Melbourne and
Adelaide, and a glance at the inland
system shows this to be so. But we are
misled by these little local agitators who
want a bucketful for their own backyards.
Most of R S. Walesers are blind to the
fact that the Murray River is wholly in
N.S.W. until it enters South Australia,
and that much of its waters below the
Hume Weir come from Victorian rivers,
the Kiewa, Ovens, Goulburn, Campaspe
and the Loddon. Yet there is now a big
demand that all the waters of the
Snowy, which N.S.W. also claims be-
cause it rises there, must go to the
Murrumbidgee.
T subscribe to the belief that a board
should be set up on the lines of T.V.A.
with unlimited authority, so that all the
waters shall be used to the best national
advantage:—B. P. P. (N.S.W.)*
Dear Vegetables
The points made by “Ek Dum” (B.
l/,12/’4B) in regard to vegetable-growing
in Japanese cities are worth noting. Our
own system of agricultural production,
hampered by the 40-hour week and other
things, is not now capable of supplying us
with vegetables at a reasonable price.
Self-help being largely a forgotten trait
of the Australian, we are, as a pen-
ance, being charged fantastic prices for
ordinary vegetables. As was pointed out
by “Red Earth” (B. 24/11//48) only
potatoes are taken into account in calcu-
lating the basic-wage, so there can be no
extra in the pay-envelope from that
quarter to offset the present exorbitant
prices of vegetables.
Cottages in outer suburbs usually have
a reasonable amount of backyard, but so
great is our preoccupation with other
matters that, in my own Sydney area, it
is doubtful if 15 per cent, of available
ground in backyards is producing vege-
tables. The unfortunate part about
gardening is that it leads to objec-
tionable acquaintance with hard work
and perspiration. The visible cash return
is not great, and many feel that the time
is wasted.
Market-gardeners are being charged up
to Is. per ton-mile for the transport of
their produce, which, when you buy it,
has lost some of its goodness and a lot of
its flavor. Labor is hard tq get, in compe-
tition with easy, well-paid five-day jobs in
the city. You cannot expect cheap vege-
tables while these conditions exist. The
best way to partly rectify the near-famine
conditions we have lately had, and with-
out having to go to the shifts that the Japs
are forced to adopt, is for suburbia to
acquire a few blisters and a bit of sun-
burn and start a few packets of seeds on'
their way to maturity.— Noonamah
(N.S.W.).
Rail and Air
Before “Dutigalla” (B. I/12/’4B) and
“D.P.J,” (B. 10/11/’4B) compare services
given by State railways and airlines, they
should find some concrete basis for such
comparison. There is none.
Train-travellers pay a fare'based on the
full cost of the service rendered, and
receive a standard of service for which
they have shown willingness and ability
to pay. Air-travellers, on the other hand,
pay about 25 per cent, of the total cost,
the balance coming out of the public
purse. How can you compare the two
services?
Similarly, while facts and figures from
the U.S.A. may be of some value to the
expert they are useless to the layman.
U.S. freight-trains do not run at 90 m.p.h.,
although they do attain up to 70 m.p.h.
under favorable conditions. Their
average speed, the important thing, is
around 16 m.p.h., not much more than
we are able to achieve here.
Some passenger trains are the last word
in speed and luxury, but their economic
position is obscure, many authorities
holding that their cost should be debited
against the advertising and publicity de-
partments. In any case, the proportion
of revenue derived from passengers is
so low that most of those roads which
still handle such traffic could abandon
the lot with profit. In Australia, with its
low-traffic density and high proportion
of “deadhead” haulage, the passenger
must be called on to contribute his share.
I hold no particular brief for the local
systems, which reflect too faithfully fixe
characteristics of their owners, but there’s
still no point in trying to compare the
incomparable,— Transporticus (Q-)»


Fellowship of Writers
“Old Freelance” (B. 1/12/ ’4B) and
“Another Freelance” (B. 8 /12 / ’4B) ap-
pear to be both prejudiced and ignorant
regarding the work of the Fellowship of
Australian Writers.
There has been no wholesale desertion
of the Fellowship by members “of the
old Australian school of writers.” The
Fellowship has not only retained the
loyalty and enthusiastic support of such
writers as Miles Franklin, Katharine
Susannah Prichard, Eleanor Dark, Will
Lawson, Dora Birtles and many others,
and of hundreds of people devoted to the
cause of literature in every State of the
Commonwealth, but its books show a
constant and gratifying increase in mem-
bers, There is, too, a steady influx of
young Writers whose names may not yet
be known to “0.F.” and “A.F.”
Possibly many of the faces seen in the
Sydney clubroom in 1938 are no longer
present. Some have died, others are too
old to come to meetings, while many
have gone to other States or live per-
manently in country areas. I doubt i/
Sydney holds “20 authors whose names
are household words to readers of Aus-
tralian books.”
The claims by “0.F.” and “A.F.” that,
for some years, the Fellowship has
ignored the aims and objects for which
it stands are similarly groundless. The
Fellowship played a leading part in two
major censorship campaigns this year—■
one arising out of the jailing and fining
of Robert Close, author of Love Me,
Sailor, and the other over the banning
of the play “Rusty Bugles.” The Fel-
lowship was the first organisation in
Australia to protest by means of press
statements, a public meeting at the Syd-
ney Radiotorium and petitions to the
Victorian Government against the savage
treatment of Mr. Close. In addition, over
£25 was raised to defray Close’s legal
costs. Last November a meeting of
theatrical and cultural interests convened
by us appointed a deputation of leading
writers and theatre personalities to wait
upon the Acting-Premier and request a
change in the.Theatres and Public Halls
Act to bring it into line with the Obscene
and Indecent Publications Act, amended
in 1946 largely as a result of Fellow-
ship agitation, to provide immunity for
“works of literature.”
In 1945 the Fellowship was prominent
in supplying evidence to the Tariff Board
Inquiry on Australian publishing, and
has subsequently led or assisted in many
moves to bring an end to the syndica-
tion evil, the dumping of cheap foreign
books and magazines in this country and
the squandering of paper resources in the
production here, under licence, of trashy
overseas magazines.
Likewise, the Fellowship has many
times brought to the notice of the
Federal Government the unfairness of
the present system of taxing authors. At
present we have in preparation a booklet
setting out the several little-known con-
cessions to which authors are entitled and
the manner in which they should be
sought.
We have taken a consistent interest in
author-publisher negotiations and have
prepared an amended model contract
which will supersede that issued by the
Fellowship in 1944.
We possess, too, written and verbal
testimony of the appreciation of authors ■
of the many functions which we have
organised over recent years. The Fel-
lowship holds regular Sunday-night meet-
ings addressed by prominent Australians'
and distinguished visitors, as well as
members’ and friends’ evenings on the
secqnd Tuesday of every month, when
matters of immediate concern to writers
are discussed. Recent speakers include
Max Murray and Maysie Greig, Robert
Close, Doris Fitton, Colin Roderick, W.
E. Fitz Henry and Frank Clewlow.
Further, by participation in Authors’
Week and in the work of the Children’s
Book Council, by the regular reviewing
and discussion of Australian books and
literary tendencies, we endeavor to ex-
tend the knowledge and appreciation of
Australian writing.
It should be obvious, therefore, that
we have done, and are doing, everything
within our power and resources to ad-
vance the cause of the Australian writer.
Those who are still dissatisfied with our
programme and performance are strongly
urged to come in and assist in shaping our
policy and in carrying this policy into
action. On the other hand, while much
pi our work is political in that it involves
approach to Governments and the en-
deavor to mould public opinion, the Fel-
lowship is not a vehicle for party poli-
tics, witch-hunting or any other practices
which tend to impose arbitrary restrictions
upon the intellectual and social interests
of Australian authors.— Muir Holburn,
president. Fellowship of Australian
Writers.
It would be interesting to know how
many members of the Fellowship make
even pin-money from writing, and why a
body professing to represent Australian
authorship should be governed by an
executive many of whom have little or no
standing as writers. Leaving out writers
who have not been members of the Fel-
lowship, how many of the following

Measles and Abos
“R.H.” (B. 8/9/’4B) appears to infer
that my figure of 160 aboriginal deaths
from measles in Central Australia during
the seven months to June is incorrect.
He states: “Official records in the
country around Alice Springs list only
28 deaths this year.”
My figure, however, was for not only
the Alice Springs country but Centralia.
My authority is the Adelaide “Register”
of 14/6/’4B. It backs up its statement by
quoting the flying-doctor at Alice Springs
(Dr. L. W. Alderman) as estimating the
total deaths at 160, and probably higher.
Also, “Dusty Mile” (B. 15/8/’4B) assumes
that I “presuppose the aboriginal in his
wild state is happy, free and well fed,”
which, he says, is not the case.
Having lived among and having em-
ployed northern abos I do not presuppose
the wild abo. is free of tribal laws and is
at all times well fed. Also, I’ve no doubt
the Binghi loafing round a mission
may be just as happy as his nomadic
brother, but the issue is not where the
black is the happier, or how station-folk,
missions and Government authorities
often mismanage them, it is what is the
best way to preserve the race.
A stone-age people living in a stone-
age era, the abo., speaking generally,
when confronted with white civilisation,
just cannot take it. So what’s the alterna-
tive?
I reiterate the one way to preserve
Binghi is to exile him —before it’s too
late —as a tribe in his own tribal terri-
tory, and, by means of special men, police
the territory so that the abos are left
entirely to themselves. This should be
possible in the Kimberleys.
But this will never come about, not only
because of the expense, but because the
public isn’t abo.-minded enough to force
the issue. Most Australians don’t know
Binghi as the best bushman, naturalist and
athlete in the world. They know him as
a being dressed in whitemen’s clothes on
stations, missions and the outskirts of
townships, an individual who is neither
a wild black nor a truly civilised one,
but an individual whom they judge by
whitemen’s standards.— Horseless H.
(Vic.).
Coal
The Joint Coal Board has admitted once
again that it cannot get the coal. Its
report, tabled in the N. S. Wales Legis-
lative Council, stated “experience had
forced the board reluctantly to conclude
that the miners’ leaders were unwilling,
or perhaps unable, to control their own
members. The board also had con-
cluded that not only were the leaders’
undertakings of no value whatever, but,
considered objectively, they could only
be regarded as tactical manoeuvres de-
signed to meet a particular industrial situ-
ation,”
As a substitute for this enforcement of
discipline, the board, in its report, pro-
posed several technical improvements,
each designed to raise production. But,
unfortunately for the board, its own
figures released earlier this year proved
that this was not the solution to the
problem.
Between January 12 and July 24, the
board reported, 986,700 tons of coal was
lost by strikes. During the same time
only 82,000 tons was lost by mechanical
breakdowns or weather. If, by magnifi-
cent technical advances, the board suc-
ceeds in eliminating the loss of 82,000
tons, the far greater loss of 986,700 tons
will remain.
The coal problem cannot be success-
fully tackled until Governments and their
stooges realise that we will only get coal
when we enforce the law on the coal-
fields.—J. B. R. (N.S.W.).
Amateur Radio Licences
“Waddlin’ Willie” (B. 10/11/’4B) ex-
presses the sentiments of all genuine wire-
less experimenters and of the Wireless
Institute of Australia. The man in the
street knows little of the radio amateur
apart from what he hears through his
dual-wave receiver. Broadcasting was
bom of the efforts and enthusiasm of
early amateur experimenters. In the early
1920’s the Sunday-morning transmissions,
on 440 and 1000 metres, of gramophone
records by a few amateurs in England
aroused such public interest that the
Radio Society of Great Britain applied
to the Post Office for a licence to run a
regular transmission. This was granted,
and 2MT Writtle, the first broadcasting
station in the British Empire, under the
control of Captain P. P. Eckersley, later
chief engineer of the 8.8. C., cairie into
being. Public approval was immediate,
but commercial interests, realising the
potentialities of the new source of enter-
tainment, forced the amateur down to
wavelengths below 200 metres, then
generally regarded as of little value. And
though the amateurs have been kept on
the low wavelengths they have gone on.
Commercial wireless is not by any means
representative of the wireless experi-
menters.
We live in an age of expanding
wonders. The deeper one delves into the
hidden mysteries of nature and science
the more one comes to realise that the
surface is, as yet, but scratched, and to
appreciate the privilege of belonging to
a fraternity which has for its hobby the
most fascinating science yet permitted to
man.
The newer developments of television,
frequency-modulation, v.h.f., etc., offer
enormous scope for experiment, and the
“old-timer” welcomes newcomers, but it
must ever be remembered that the tradi-
tions of service to the Empire in peace
and war, perseverance, and devotion to
the amateur cause, built up painstakingly
-for over three decades, must be preserved.
In the old days the few undesirables
who managed to get on the air did no
great harm, and in time either learned
good operating or faded out entirely.
Nowadays, with the widespread use of
dual-wave sets by the public, the activities
of some “tinkerers” demands the strictest
action by the P.M.G. The very interna-
tional nature of short-wave communica-
tion can be a wonderful force for uni-
versal brotherhood among nations. It
can just as easily hold Australia up to
the wide world as a laughing-stock.—

“Human Rights”
There is no more graphic illustration
of the futility of U.N.O. than the draft
declaration of human rights drawn up by
the social committee for submission to
the Assembly. It proposes to define the
rights and freedoms which should be
accorded everyone regardless of religion,
race and nationality. It condemns slavery,
asks for equal pay for equal work for
women and equal rights in marriage and
divorce, declares that everyone has the
right to freedom of religion, opinion and
expression. Everyone, too, has the right
to an adequate standard of living and
regular holidays'With pay.
Citizens of more than one member of
U.N.O. do not enjoy some or any of
these stipulated “rights,” nor are they
likely to, even though the countries in
question endorse the declaration with
a great show of enthusiasm.
Definition of “adequate standard of
living” would tax the ingenuity of a con-
stitutional lawyer. Regular holidays with
pay cannot be classed as a fundamental
human right. Its justification is as de-
batable as many other proposals listed by
its champions under that vague heading,
social reform. Where legally instituted
this alleged right is confined to em-
ployees'! Self-employed persons—inde-
pendent craftsmen, small farmers, shop-
keepers, etc. —have to take their holidays
at their own expense, Economist

Root of the Matter
It has been said that the Government’s
free-medicine scheme will turn us into
a nation of medicine-takers. It does not
need an Act of Parliament to do this.
From a Sydney paper: “On November
25, 1925, a customer handed in a pre-
scription to a Lewisham chemist.
Every Saturday morning since then,
with the regularity of a metronome,
somebody has arrived from the
customer’s home, seven miles away,
with the prescription to repeat. It is a
very simple tonic, and it’s been dispensed
1187 times for the one person, with un-
failing regularity, every Saturday morn-
ing for 23 years.”—R. W. (N.S.W.).
Chifley was about 50 years too late in
lodging application for patent rights in
the phrase he used during the Parlia-
mentary “pensions” debate: “If you want
to know what God thinks of money, have
a look at the people who’ve got it” (B.
22/12/’4B). Mark Twain said it half a
century ago in the form—“ You can tell
what God thinks of money by the sort
of people he gives it to.” To dear old
Mark Twain, in the celestial regions,
Chifley is not worth powder and shot.
But his friends, at least, would not have
let any self-pensioning politician rob him
like that while Mark was alive. — Ren-
mark (S.A.).
No doubt Randolph E. Bedford is right
in saying that the great mass of Chinese
have no desire to emigrate (B. 10/11/’4B).
That would be natural in a country with
an economy predominantly rural, and
holdings mostly small and worked mainly
by family labor. France presents some-
what of a European equivalent. Still,
there are 400 million or so Chinamen, so,
even if those who find it necessary, or
economically advantageous, to leave their
homeland form but a modest minority,
they are likely to be numerous. As a
matter of fact the Chinaman has proved
himself the most notable emigrator, of
modern times, in all Asia. Not only did
Chinese swarm into Burma, Malaya,
Indonesia and other far-eastern lands,
throughout the second half of the nine-
teenth century, but they also went in con-
siderable numbers into Australia, Canada
and U.S.A. until checked by legislation,
and established themselves in various
parts of the Pacific islands and in Spanish-
American countries. Even far-away
English , cities acquired their Chinese
colonies. — Tom (N.S.W.).
Since the increase in Sydney tram-fares
it is now often cheaper to travel by taxi.
Five of us took a taxi from Central Rail-
way to Woollahra and were charged
2s. 3d. for the trip in a modern, com-
fortable and fast car. We did the return
trip in a Government tram. The fare for
each of us was sixpence, a total of 2s. 6d.,
and the journey was noisy, uncomfort-
able and took three times as long.—

Fitted with a 5 cubic yard Traxcavator
Shovel, a Caterpillar D 4 Diesel Tractor
speeds the loading of salt at stock
piles,
"Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors and Earth-Moving Equipment shifted 1,500,000 cubic yards of
tidal swamp and reared up 25 miles of retaining walls to form Dry Creek’s acres of salt-
concentrating ponds. And the harvesting of hundreds of thousands of tons of salt also calls
for the dependability, economy and tireless power of "Caterpillar ”
Converted into a Salt Harvester, this Caterpillar D 4 Diesel Tractor, carrying a heavy
superstructure, makes harvesting of salt a quick but simple procedure.
Salt for the tables of Australia’s homes, alkali products soda ash,
caustic soda, bicarbpnate of soda and calcium chloride for a host of
Australian industries are being won by the evaporation of sea water at
the Dry Creek Solar Salt Fields of 1.C.1. Alkali (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.
At this vast project, so vital to essential industry, the whole of the con-
structional and maintenance work is carried out by "Caterpillar” Diesel
Tractors and Earth-Moving Equipment. And at harvesting time, when
complete evaporation has left a deposit of salt 4 to 5 inches thick over
acres of "ponds,” "Caterpillar” lifts the year’s yield. Machines mounted
on "Caterpillar” Diesel D 4 Tractors deliver the garnered salt to portable
