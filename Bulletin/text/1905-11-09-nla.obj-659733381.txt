FERSES BY ARTHUR MAQUARIB
Arthur Maquarie is a wandering Australian of
whom there is vague information only. Rumour
declares that he knew (and loathed) Sydney
University until his departure for London seven
or eight years ago, impelled by a fierce desire to
see and feel the w.ider world. London fed him or
starved him, and published his little book of
Aurelia, “ a lyrical scena ” (1900). Now for some
years he has been settled in Florence, teaching
English to the Italians (it is said), and he has
added a wife to himself, Mary Lintner Maquarie,
who illustrates. another book of verse little but
larger ( The Dance of Olives, just published by
J. M. Dent & Co., 4s. net). “ This little book we
dedicate to one .'mother. ” Her little sketches are
soft and sympathetic: his little verses have a
gleam of poetry—no more; yet one likes their
surging vigour of sincerity. The title-piece does
not attract; but v in the supplementary oddments
there are to ponder, and the burlesque
Sonnets hold an original note. On this page three
sre quoted, and the author’s vociferous envoy
“Raglio di Somaro.”
B. E. Minns is one Australian established in
London. He writes on Sept. 22 that “ things have been
rory brisk with me. I’ve been kept busy lor a long time
on commissions, both water-colours and black and white.”
And he sold his Academy picture, 12in. x!2in., at a fair
WHEN I reflect how little faith remains
In this sad world, and how the days
beget
Uncounted new necessities to fret
My lofty soul; and when I view my gains
So vilely nothing after infinite pains—
As one who doffs a disproved amulet
I lay my last hope by of genial debt
And silent gaze on life’s drear hard-cash plains.
Then in a trice the thought of bread and cheese
Comes mantling o’er me like a thunder gloom
That ere the wind can change will crash down
doom,
And in a'vision I behold my knees
Spread with cold herrings in an attic room-r-
“ Ah God!” I dumbly cry, ‘‘Not these, not
these ! ”
Jfi
If all the sorrows in the world were joined
(Which is n’t likely) into one great fire,
Or interwoven as a web from Tyre,
Or like the arches of a fane ongroined,
Then could I smile and see my verse purloined,
Or rest serene among the hurl of mire
To sweep in solemn grandeur on my lyre
Such strains as know not of a value coined.
But coming in continual dribs and drabs
They weary me till I forget my muse, 1
Ay, till the very soul of me refuse
To rise triumphant above broken tabs.
How can I fling my thunderbolts at Zeus
While on the stairs a raucous house-dame gabs !
Tell me what boots to battle, when the end
Is foreseen failure ? What, by heaven, I ask—
By bearded martyrs, and the holy cask
Of papal comfort, what can struggle lend
Of true nobility to those who bend
Constrained after all ? ’T were better bask
With resignation and a quiet flask
Than rush to strokes that heaven will surely send.
Methinks the base desire to pose for pars
Is bam within the blood like lechery,
And as the wavelet curls in every sea
The schQOlboy bares his wounds and thinks him
Mars.
Give me Petrarca and a pot ox tea,
And carry thou thy honourable scars.
L myself, dark hidden at the core
Of strange-formed, troublous clay, with its gross
needs ;
I, clamourous, ill-voiced, lonely, aching I,
Ah exiled soul, a suffocating god,
I free my throat for one great, hard-heaved cry.
I want, I will have Joy ! No curses now
On Christs or worlds or wry infinities.
What care have I, what lightest care have I
For all that is or was or never was,
While in the throb and burning essence of me
Is one great straining, stifling after Joy?
I must have love. I will not live except
I soon find great, deep-eyed, wide-bosomed love.
I must have beauty, beauty in these days
Of rise and work, and eat and work and rest,
And beauty in these nights of dreamless dark.
And I demand of—well, I still demand,
Or cry for—cranky not with words —I need
Live poems in the soul to hum and lilt
Through days and nights and glowing months and
years;
And I will have clear mind to peer them through,
And some small voice to sing them to my ears
And the free thrill and tingle of my soul.
Yes, I will have all this and more, for I
Require a keener vision to my eyes;
I must attain to see that Beauty’s 3elf
That lurks evasive in the bosky world,
For one short glimpse, one even hidden glimpse,
As love in tears, or roses drenched with rain.
I writhe enough beneath the firm cold claw
That grips my earthy throat; I feel within
The lightness of a thing that knows to fly ;
And, being too long withheld, the yearning comes
To leave my clay and circle in the sun.
The warmth of Spring noon calls me, and the
sound
Of just-missed musio wh 3 re the poplar rears.
The sob of want clots up my throat again,
Come love, song, beauty, Life—or meet me free.
N.S.W. PUBLIC LIBRARY
AT the desire of some of my friends,”
wrote John Wesley in his journal
on 22 Dec., 1780, “ I accom-
panied them to the British Museum. What
an immense field is here for curiosity to
range in ! One large room is filled from top
to bottom with things brought from Otahe-
ite ; two or three more with things dug out
of the ruins of Herculaneum ! Seven huge
apartments are filled with curious books;
five with manuscripts ; two with fossils of
all sorts, and the rest with various animals.
But what account will a man give to the
Judge of quick and dead for a life spent in
collecting, all these ? ”
Well, if there were a Judge of the kind
Wesley means (since the Wesleyan dogma
upon that point is unsupported by the least
scrap of evidence), and if the Judge wer e
a Judge, one would say a man might give a
very good account. To enjoy life usefully
is the best ideal of human existence ever
formulated ; and it is patent that many
book- and curiosity-collectors enjoy their
lives, and that their collections may be useful
in helping other people to enjoy life.
J*
This is assumed by contributors to the
Mitchell library discussion. For information
of readers in Invercargill it may be said that a
previous-generation Mitchell acquired large
tracts of N.S.W. territory : which, as they
became populated, became lucrative. To-
day’s Mitchell, a very old bachelor, graduated
at Sydney University, was admitted to
N.S.W. Bar, and devoted a good deal of his
life and lucre to the collection of memorials
of Australasia in the shape of books, MSS.,
pictures, prints, and the like. Of its kind,
his collection is said to be the most valuable
extant, and it is said that he purposes be-
queathing it to New South Wales.
“It is said” : for, so far as known, public
information of the donor’s purpose has been
gathered at second-hand. A part of the col-
lection has been delivered already to N.S.W.
Public Library trustees ; and during several
years communications extolling the gift have
been published in the Sydney press. Direct
statements from the donor have been
singularly wanting. It is to be sup-
posed that N.S. W. Govt, has some definite
notification of the conditions of the gift; and
in that case these should be published.
N.S.W. Public Works Committee recently
sat to discuss the site of the library building
which—“it is said”—must be provided to
make the gift valid ; and the donor did not
present himself, apparently was not directly
represented, and supplied no memorandum
of his intentions. Yet the Committee re-
solved to recommend an expenditure of
125,000?. —probably to be increased—and
the allotment of a site in the Domain !
J*
Clearly, the first thing the Committee
should have done was to ascertain from Mr.
Mitchell himself exactly what he proposes.
If he proposes to give a valuable collection
on condition that a suitable building is pro-
vided, the next thing was obviously to secure
expert opinion regarding the value and ex-
tent of the collection. Then the Committee
could have judged what sacrifice and
what expenditure might be advisable
in order to secure the gift. Lacking
a valuation of the gift, lacking even know-
ledge of the nature of the gift, the Com-
mittee’s recommendations are plainly worth-
less. We attach no importance to the
guesses of the late Professor Morris, and
little to the eulogies of parasites. The
Public Librarian, it appeared from the report
of a Select Committee in 1900, has acted as
Mr. Mitchell’s commissioner in' purchasing
books—a singular position for a public
servant to occupy, if the books had not then
been guaranteed as a public trust. Alto-
gether, a good deal more light is wanted
upon the matter.
Working in darkness, the P.W. Com-
mittee recommended building in the Domain
and spending 125,000?. at least on a building
designed without competition. All the
recommendations are bad. They left out of
account the present library building—which
cost possibly 50,000?., is in good preserva-
tion, and can give excellent service to the
extent of its capacity. For anything but
a library it is practically useless. If
a new building is constructed to hold the
existing general collection, the present build-
ing is amply adequate for Mr. Mitchell’s
collection and the Australasian books already
owned by the library.—And the committee
left out of account a great many other things.
A.a.s.

In A Year In My Garden (Melb.; Melville and
Mullen) Mrs. Arthur Tuekett sets down agreeably, month
by month, what is and should and may be done in an Aus-
tralian ditto. It is a book for good husbands to take
honie to horticultural wives when there is need of peace-
offering or isn’t: those suburban ladies who object to
strenuous bridge may find the book a buckler to their
heresy. The binding is cloth and rather shabby ; several
illustrations are bright ; and ss. is too much to pay : half-
a-erown seems fair. The author says :
“ hardening was the earliest occupation of mankind ;
therefore,’ by reason of its antiquity alone, it should be
the most honoured of all the arts.”
This is deplorably unphilo.-ophical, but no matter.
N.S.W. PUBLIC LIBRARY
John Barlow writes:
The Maequarie-street site seleoted by the
Works Department for the proposed N.S.W.
Library is unsuitable for two reasons : in th@ first
place it is out of the way, and, secondly, it is far
too circumscribed for a fine building, except by
an extensive encroachment on the best part of the
Domain. 1
The first objection applies also to Cook Park,
which, otherwise, is incomparably the best posi-
tion yet suggested. A Deference Library should
be situated as nearly as possible in the heart of
the town—if freedom from noise and dust can be
obtained —so as to be easy of access both to the
busy man and the earnest student. It is not in-
tended for those who wish to drowse away an idle
hour, or find a pleasant shelter on a rainy after-
noon.
' \> jt
The Govt. Architect’s design for the new
Library is far from being satisfactory, and it
would be probably less pleasing when erected
than it appears in the drawing—especially if the
suggestion that it should be built entirely of stone
be adopted. In brick and stone, as originally
intended, the charm of the contrasting colours
would hide, to some extent, the unpleasing forms
of the style selected —a debased Renaissance. One
cannot, at will, translate a design expressly
intended to be constructed of brick and stone into
a building of any other material without certain
artistic less.
But the Public Works Committee could not be
expected to know this. Some of its members may
have taste, but none of them have the slightest
pretension to any technical knowledge, and they
cannot, therefore, suggest how the design before
them may be improved, even if they dislike it.
Consequently they are compelled to accept such
evidence as may be offered, and draw what con-
clusions they can from it. They are called upon
to recommend the approval or rejection of large
engineering or architect oral schemes, all of a
highly technical nature. They have no professional
advisers, and the greater part of the evidence placed
before them is supplied by interested officials. Any
gratuitous outside advice or suggestion that may
be offered, comes from those who desire a cheap
advertisement, or who have self-interest to serve
by befriending or belittling the Department whose
proposals are under notice. Such evidence is, of
course, valueless, as the members of the Public
Works Committee well know, though they still
continue to advertise for it. But they are only
the representatives of a System, and while that
System pays them liberally for their labours they
have a natural disinclination to do anything that
might mend it—or end it.
&
The Government Architect is the slave of another
System equally farcical and equally expensive. He
is called upon to design and supervise the erection
of all the public buildings of a great State, and
likewise to administer the affairs of a great de-
partment. Most of his work must be relegated
to subordinates, for it is manifestly impossible for
any one man, no matter how capable he may be,
to attend to one-fourth of it. So the drawings are
prepared in the Government plan-factory when-
ever a new building is required ; and, to avoid the
charge of monotonous repetition which has some-
times been levelled at it, the officials of the Sys-
tem take care to brand each product of the factory
with divers architectural labels. Thus we have a
Greek National Gallery, a Renaissance Treasury,
an Italian Custom House ; our Florentine General
Post Office is surmounted by a hybrid French
structure, and the medical schools and library
attached to our University are 15th century
English Gothic. There are also hundreds of
minor buildings, all over the country, ranging
through the whole cyclopedia of architectural
styles, and representative of every period but our
own.
In common honesty it must be said that these
designs are generally good of their kind ; consider-
ing the system under which they are produced
they are sometimes wonderfully good—take the
National Gallery, for example. But one and all
lack the individuality that is the life-blood of
every art.
Architectural successes cannot be manufactured
to order on the shortest notice. It is not possible
to name one building of modem times designed
and erected under departmental supervision in
which an artistic success has been achieved—even
under the most favourable conditions ; and, there-
fore, it so might happen that a man with even less
ability than Mr. Vernon undoubtedly possesses,
would, on occasion, produce a more satisfactory
design for a public building. In any case, an.
open competition would give a more extended
range of selection, and many valuable suggestions
might be obtained. It is only in Australia that
Government architects are allowed such a wide
scope ; in England, eminent men in private prac-
tice are commissioned to carry out great national
works, and limited or open competitions are
invariably called for in others of less importance.
So it is in the United States, where they still have
a supervising architect under departmental con-
trol, but any large work is never entrusted to him.
The American Libraries at Boston and New York,
and the Library of Congress, were designed and
carried out by architects in private practice, and
they are all the results of competitions.

That bright little paper, Barrier Truth, com-
mences publication of* mother Australian story by “ Tom
Oollins, writer of Such is Life.
J. G. writes : Coonoogle, not coogle , is a common
word in the South of Ireland, meaning- to wheedle. Like
many such words, its origin is to be found half in Gaelic
and half in English— e. 'g., England coonoogled Ireland
from the Irish. Hear the soft “ coo,” then the negative
of struggling victims and the cooing mixed—and the
knock-out strangle in the last syllable !
PARODIES
GOOD parodies are delightful criticism.
Keen-edged and clean-cutting, they draw
blood almost without wounding; and
bleeding is nowadays healthful inletters,
if no longer in anaemic life. G. F. Forrest, who
publishes a pleasant book of parodies in Misfits
(Oxford, Harvey ; 2s. 6 d. net), adopts the mode of
imitation rather than of caricature: that is, he
parodies form rather than spirit, while the best
parody travesties both. The value of imita-
tation depends upon essential merit: if
it be good it would be good in any shape,
and the borrowed style is merely decorative
plumage. Some of Mr. Forrest’s imitations
appeal especially to an Oxford audience, and
by that lose general force. Yet he is light and
bright and dexterous, and his pen leaves a ripple of
smiles. The recently-invented MSS. of Francis
Bacon are clever, but for the reason given do not
touch us so sharply as the “ essay in profound
hopelessness ” dedicated to the author of PeUAas et
Milisande. The scene is a football-ground,
shrouded in funereal gloom...and here a dramatic
fragment:
Seventh Plater : Oh ! Oh ! Somebody has kicked me
in my circumstance. I am feeling quite unwell. 1 can
scarcely breathe. Oh ! Oh !
First Player : Give him air. Givh him all the air there
is.
Second Player : How sad ! It is, broadly speaking, the
saddest thing I know.
Third Player : Surely the thought of the entire empti-
ness of the void is sadder still.
First Spectator : Perhaps so. Nevertheless, this is
very sad.
Second Spectator : Yes, it is sad.
Eighth Player : I do not like, sir, to be kicked in the
mouth. I cannot regard it as a friendly act. I shall not
enrol you among my personal friends. Ido not think my
friends would like it at all. You are extremely distasteful
to me. You are more distasteful to me than pork chops.
Ninth Player ■ I am very fond of pork chops. I
frequently dandle them in my arms. There is a pink
infinitude about them, which is very charming.
Eighth Player : I cannot agree with you.
Tenth Player : I cannot- persuade myself that the
referee is a good man. Ido not imagine that he will go
to Heaven when he dies. '
Referee (aside): Oh ! oh !
Eleventh Player : Do you not think that it is quite
time for him to die now ? '
Referee : Oh ! Oh !
Twelfth Player : I certainly think it would be a good
thing for him to die.
Thirteenth Player : Then we must help him to die,
must we not ?
(The referee dies, under pressure, and the ground is soon
cleared. Only the two spectators remain, looking
down on the corpse.)
First Spectator : I have often thought that there is
nothing sadder in life than the spectacle of a dead referee.
It reminds me of a ’cello solo. It is terribly sad.
Second Spectator : And yet I have known sadder
things. The shuddering pallor of a weeping willow is in-
comparably more sad. •
First Spectator : That is so. Oh ! that is certainly so.
But still, there is something of sad in this.
Second Spectator ; Yes, it is very sad.
(They drift silently away, and are lost in the gloom.
The curtain descends slowly in a succession Of
choking sobs.)
Of the verses one likes best a nursery rhyme as
told by Stephen Phillips:
Now, by the kindly Sun, and by the Styx,' '
That ninefold girdle of the Underworld,
By all your hopes, and by your mothers’ tears —
Yea, by your homes, and\ the pale smoke that curie
Up from the steaming altars of the Gods
To where the Gods themselves hold revelry,
By all the oaths ye never brake till now,
Not knowing them, speak truly, tell me this :
Who killed Cock Robin ?
Even I, great King,
I, whom men call the Sparrow, even I.
ome ! I slew him, with a murderous bolt,
With a hurricane gust of slaughter, with a flash
Of turbulent hate in a tempest of pattering blood,
With a terrible tearing rush of an arrow loosed
To the twang of the straightened bow, with a scream, with
a hiss 1 ' ■' f ’;: "
That whistled a dim horror down the wirijd
Through all the misty mazes of the world,
And shrilled an echo in the halls of Hell,
Till all the shuddering ghosts wailed pitifully,
And gibbered wanly in the pallid gloom,
Divining nameless outrage — o, my lord,
I, even l, I sleiv him, even I.

In part vii of A Critical Revision of the Genus
Eucalyptus (Syd., Govt. Printer; 2a 6<f.)J. H. Maiden
considers E. regnans, dives, Andrewsi, diversifolia,. and
those dubious species, vitellina and vitrea : and is
happy (?) in the knowledge that, at the present rate of
progress, he -has probably ten years more elucidation
ahead of him—so vast and variable is the distinguished
genus. E. regnans is our champion : the largest tree in
Australia and one of the largest on earth : surpassed, it
seems, only by the Amer. Sequoia. Von Mueller gives it
“ not rarely a height of over 400 feet ” : Maiden reduces
it to “ about 300 feet ”—which is still big enough for
kindling-wood.—ln this number the printer has returned
to his stupid fashion of separating plates and explanations,
so that one has to turn over several pages to get a refer-
ence.

rifle, all that it is necessary to do to shoot it ten times is to
pull the trigger for each shot. Although automatic in action,
it is simple in construction and not apt to get out of order.

HANS PETER RASMUSSEN,
A BALMAIN TRIBUTE
Many Failures, Final Success.
The Case of Mr. <l. BERLIN.
(By a Special Reporter.;
At the bootmaking premises of Mr.
John Berlin, which are situated at
.No. 357 Darling-street, Balmain, a re-
porter had an interview of sufficient
interest to the public to justify its
appearance in these columns. Mr. Ber-
lin s lemarks were :
“Kor a considerable period prior to
two years ago I was unfortunate in
ihavmg a serious turn of ill-health, and
now that I am well again it is my
desire to impart to other sufferers
■such information as will enable them
to get rid of their ailments also, for
nothing is so bard as to be ill and
not know what to take to get better.”
"What was amiss with you, Mr. Ber-
lin 7" queried the writer.
"Everything, 1 think ; for I seemed
to have gone wrong in every conceiv-
able shape and lorm, and what caused
me to feel my position ao keenly wai
the fact that I could gain no benefit
from anything J took. The remedies 1
tried were so numerous that I icallv
.cannot remember them all, and besides
those things 1 drank a lot of physic
which my doctors prescribed for me.
They said my kidneys and liver were
out of order, and that J was thorough-
ly run down as well, and, goodness
Iknows, they were right, for my vi-
tality was so low that 1 hadn't
■enough energy to do a stroke of work.
Many a day' 1 felt so weary, so ut-
terly downcast and fatigued, that .1
-could not remain at my shop any
longer, and 1 would knock off : but
■even then J did not better myself, as
1 could find neither peace nor enjoy-
ment in any direction. What a differ-
ence there was in me then compared
to the time when 1 landed in Sydney
ifrom Sweden—which was on the day
that the -New South Wales troops ar-
'rived from the Soudan. J was then so
ihearty and vigorous that I hardly
•knew my own strength, but what a
sorry wreck 1 was a little over two
K.rs ago. 1 was wretched with a
ing as if something dreadful was
going to happen—as if I had done
something wrong a-nd was going to be
ipaid back in my own coin, and I took
quite a dislike to mixing in company.
J felt that 1 always wanted to be
.alone—that the world was a sham,
and that there was nothing in it to
■live for ; and, true enough, there was
nothing in it for me to live for, un-
less it was to suffer pain and discom-
fort all day long. My nerves were
very bad —as weak as they could be ;
and on the slightest provocation they
would vibrate and twitch dreadfully.
J used to sit and mope about by my-
sell. thinking of all kinds of unhappv
things, and even wandering in my
mind«; and it surprised those who
knew how even-tempered I used to be
to find that I became cross and ill-
grained over nothing. But that all
comes from the lner, I believe, for over
isince mine was put right by Clements
Tonic 1 have been an entirely different
iman.”
"What induced you to resort to the
use of Clements Tonic ? Was it recom-
mended to you ?”
"Yes; somebody was telling me
about it, and l thought it would n<pt
be a bad plan to see if what was said
was true, and 1 soon discovered that
I had not been misled, for by the time
1 had taken about three bottles of
Clements Tonic 1 knew instinctively
that my recovery was assured. And
when you hear that i had gone from
thirteen stone to ten stone you can
guess how delighted I was to know
that 1 had got something at last that
■would surely save me. Yes; there was
little more than the frame of me left,
and i was just asi feeble as I looked.
Bow could I expect to be otherwise with
the appetite 1 had V Why, some days
I could not eat anything at all, and
■would actually sicken at the sight of j
Address,
food ; bat I cannot say I was any-
thing like that after Clements Tonic
had been given a chance of showing
what it was made of. JNo, indeed , the
tables were turned in a very decided
manner in that respect, for I could
soon eat anything that was put before
me, and didn’t L feel easier after meals
compared to what l used to ? JNo feel-
ings in the stomach as if it were full
of wind, no cramping pains there, and
l didn't feel as if my clothes were too
tight for mo, as 1 had done. But
those were really small matters when
placed in line with the severe head-
aches that 1 had to endure every day
until it was my good fortune to be
brought in touch with Clements Tonic;
and when that happened—-well, the re-
lief 1 gained was wonderful. It was
not only relief from headaches that 1
got, though, but, later on, an abso-
lute cure, and another thing which
made me glad 1 stuck to Clements
Tonic for a while was the fact that I
lost all thoso fits of giddiness that
used to attack me. Yes, I used to
feel awfully strange sometimes, as if
the room was spinning round, and for
a brief space 1 would remember noth-
ing. Once Clements Tonic checked
those horrible sensations- they have
uever since occurred again, and 1 I can
truthfully say the same of the smo-
thering sensations in my chesit, which
seemed to get so tight that I could
not draw my breath. It was l quite a
general thing for me to have hurtful
sensations between the shoulders and
nght across my loins, but Clements
Tonic did not fail me there either —
no, indeed, it brought ease to every
part of my body, even to my eyes,
which had had a heavy, lumpy tee-ling
in them for months, and my sight got
clear as well. Upon my life, it was
like being born again-, for whereas pre-
vious to taking Clements Tonic I
could never got a night’s rest, after-
wards 1 could sleep almost as soon as
my head got settled on the pillow, -and
1 had none of the old dreams to dis-
turb me as formerly. And, another
thing, Clements Tonic did a-way with
the objectionable taste that had- per-
vaded my mouth, besides' removing
from the tongue all the- slimy coating
that it had been- covered with. Whilst
all this was going on my nervous sys-
tem was undergoing a beneficial
change. T became evenly balanced in
mind and steady in nerves, which
showed that Clements Tonic streng-
thens the brain as well as the 'body,
and that accounts for my sleeping so
well, and al’so for ceasing to worry
and to get irritable at trifles. Those
of my friends- who had seen me in
agony so Jong, and who used- to give
pitiful glances at me when 1 was- wast-
ing away, were spellbound with amaze-
ment at the work Clement-s Tonic had
done ; and the best of it is thart i
have remained cured ever since.”

this statement ?”
“You may publish it in any way it
pleases you, for I’ve said noithing but
the plain truth.’'

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Chippin’.”
Oh ! we clear away from Glasgow, or from Liver-
pool or Goole—
An’ the tug-boat’s far astern an’ the sails are set
an’ full,
But we’re only feelin’ middlin’ after yesterday’s
debauch,
When the mate, with sulky features, sets about
to pick the watch.
Then it’s rolling in the Biscay, in the doldrums
running east,
An’we’ve learned the “old man” boozes and the
second mate’s a beast,
Till at last we reach Port Phillip—up the Yarra
slowly crawl,
Get her snugged and berthed securely opposite
the Gasworks’ wall.
Then it’s chip, chip—
With the hammer in your grip,
From the anchors at the cathead
To beneath the counter’s dip.
An’ the rust gets in your windpipe fit to aggravate
a saint.
Oh ! it’s bully work for sailors when ye’re set to
ehippin’ paint.
In the mornin’, see the “old man” startin’ off to
go to town.
He’s a cab outside the shed door an’ he rides both
up an’ down.
Goes to lunch with Mister Agent—smokes a very
good cigar,
An’has “something nice” to talk to, in a toffy
city bar.
Oh ! the mates are worse than he is—don’t they
both put on “the dog,”
For a sailor-man to them is little better than a
log.
They can always draw a.sov’rin’ when they like,
without a frown,
But the “ old man ” growls like thunder at our
modest half-a-crown.
Then it’s chip, chip,
Till you fairly get the “pip,”
An’ the streets all seem to beckon —
Sayin’, “Give the thing the slip.”
The propellers of the steamers raise a stench that
makes you faint,
From the ancient Yarra waters while ye’re busy
ehippin’ paint.
But the longest day must finish, and the city’s
myriad lights
Seem to call, “Here’s consolation—here you’ll
find your joy o’ nights.”
Bright eyes dartin’ glances at you full o’ fun an’
coquetry—
Come an’ make your choice, 0 sailors, there is joy
for you and me.
It’s a dream. The lights are beacons, an’ around
them is the shoal.
An’ the bright-eyed maids are further from the
sailor than the pole.
There’s the public, and the barmaid—free of speech,
gold-haired and stout,
An’ her smiles just last as long as we have got the
coin to shout.
Then it’s chip, chip,
Stagger homeward to your ship,
Stumblin’ down the grimy wharfside,
With a lurch an’ then a slip.
In the mornin’ up an’ at it, though you’ve got the
old complaint—
Yer tongue’s like frizzled leather while ye’re hard
at ehippin’ paint.

The Vision.
I dreamed. Methought it was the end,
And winds and waves were still,
And suddenly the light turned grey
And shades fell o'er the hill.
A Hand was stretched across a sky
All stained with lurid bars,
And blotted out the sun and moon,
And darkened all the stars.
And mothers wept, and children clung,
And wantons wailed and prayed;
And unbelievers called to God,
And lover called to maid.
Out of the earth, the fated earth,
White smoke in columns curled,
And path and plain grew pregnant with
The reptiles of the world.
Sudden the skies were split in twain,
As with a mighty rod,
What time all men and women quailed—
Afraid to see their God.
And then, the sundered skies atween,
Flashes effulgent came,
The earth was flushed to crimson, and
The heavens were turned to flame.
Then, lo! within the opening,
Seated a star upon,
With mocking face and leering eyes,
I saw the Evil One /
He wore a garment of the Sun,
And thrice the Earth surveyed ;
And thrice he closed the clefted clouds,
And thrice the clouds obeyed.
And this I know—that strong men fall;
That monarchs are dethroned ;
That those we worshipped yesterday
To-day are martyrs stoned.
And when I look the world upon,
And hear the people moan,
With sinking heart I, fearful, ask:
“ Who sitteth on the Throne ? ”

A POSSIBLE BOOM.
For the first time in many years there are signs
which suggest the faint possibility of another
boom, and with a few more years of good har-
vests, of good wool prices, of a good mineral out-
put and reasonably high market quotations for
silver and lead, the thing may actually arrive.
If it does it will be a national disaster, for the
Australian boom is like no other animal on earth.
It is based on the accumulation of a great deal of
money, combined with a pathetic inability to
decide what to do with it. The accumulated
money may be to a great extent loan money, but
if so that fact doesn’t alter the situation in the
least. It is the case over again of the old-time
shearer knocking down his cheque. He had the
Cheque, he had no rational idea what to do with
and he scattered it wildly in bad rum. And
presently the cheque was gone, and there was
nothing to show for it except a long and painful
process of recovery. Except for the fact that
Australia scattered its money in bad banks, in
oarl railways, and in frantic land-jobbing, its case,
when last it had a boom, was just that of the old-
time sodden shearer over again.
t * * * *
When the last boom started there was a good
deal of genuine Australian money, behind it.
inere was also a vast amount of foreign loan
money State loans, municipal loans, and deposits
that fatuous bank managers had raked together in
England and Scotland—but it wasn’t all loan
money. For the moment Australia didn’t know
exactly What to do with its cash. With this vast
empty land to open up, with great wildernesses
that were capable of agricultural settlement wait-
ing to be settled, With the need for factories to
turn out locally the £30,000,000 or £40,000,00(1
worth of goods which were needlessly im-
ported every year, with railways and other
public works to be constructed, and with all the
much-babbled-about “great natural resources” to
be attended to, the fact remained that Australia
was stuck for an outlet for a little surplus coin.
It might have built factories with it, and added
millions of people to its population in consequence,
and also added a huge list of industrial companies
to the share-lists of its Stock Exchanges, and in-
creased enormously the business of local banks,
insurance companies and traders, but it didn’t,
Ihe miserably inadequate tariffs of all the States
made the starting of great industries almost im-
possible and wholly unattractive. There was very
little hope of competing, at Australian wage rates
and under Australian Conditions, with the
sweated toilers in the ■ East End of London, and
with many other toilers in even worse case ;
and besides, the country had got the importing
disease in its worst form, and it had never really
acquired the manufacturing habit. So in the boom
cays, when the country had a temporarv abund-
ance of wealth to invest in new industries, the
manufacturing population didn’t increase nearly
so fast as it did in subsequent years of poverty.
Again, the superfluous money might have gone in
pro mot mg agricultural settlement, but it didn’t,
it Victoria had compulsorily broken up the great
estates of the Western District, and if N.S W
had suppressed the A. A, Co. and the Peel River
Co., and forced the great and almost empty areas of
f“ e tab’e-land into use ; and if S.A. had wiped out
the S.A Co. octopus, and the other States had
followed suit, it would have been possible to create
a rush of genuine agricultural settlement all over
the habitable portion of Australia. Then the
banks, instead of going mad in city booms, could
have lent out their surplus funds on good security
to new settlers. But in those days the big land-
lord was still a god—even now he is a good deal
of a god—and to disturb him would have been
worse than sacrilege. So that outlet was also
closed.
* * * *
The period was one of railway-building mania,
and in view of the temporary affluence, the
Governments might have decided to so far in-
crease taxation as to allow of new railways being
built out of revenue. But the loan disease had
grown to awful and incredible dimensions, and it
had come to be an article of faith that all public
works must be constructed out of loans, that all
land-sale receipts must be spent as revenue, and
that n times were unusually good the revenue
must still be got rid of somehow with nothing per-
show for it. As for any idea of paying
oft old foreign debts out of revenue, the Govern-
ment which propounded such an idea would have
been regarded as something akin to a dangerous
lunatic, feo Australia, with some surplus cash in
its pocket, and shut out by the folly of its rulers
which was simply its own folly reflected in its
rulers—from investing it in any large scheme of
manufactures, of agricultural settlement, or of
public works, or in the reduction of its old debts
got drunk. And because it had money of its own
to get drunk with, it borrowed other people’s
money that it might get drunker, and then it
handed its unlimited local I O IT over to the pub-
lican that it might get drunkest. There was a
great increase of population. There was nothing
like a corresponding increase of manufactures, or
of land settlement in regions where real settlement
was possible, to support that population. But
there were founded about eight times as many
banks as the public needed. There were thou-
sands of people selling bits of suburban
land to each other, and discounting each other’s
bills, and trading off to each other what they
called desirable estates,"’ and running up streets
and streets of houses to accommodate a new city
population for which there was no real employ-
ment. The beer remained about the same, but
the froth on top of it ipereased enormously till it
over-balanced. Where the actual producers in-
creased 10 per cent., the middlemen and com-
mercial and financial parasites that they had to
support multiplied 50 per cent. There was in
some States enough banking, finance, share-
broking, law, land-agency and miscellaneous office
assistance to serve three times the manufacturing
mining, agricultural and pastoral population. And
in a few years the little superfluous wealth that
the country really possessed, and the money
tnrrowed from abroad, and the local bill, P.N.
debenture and I O U which passed for a while as
money, were absorbed in supporting these para-
sites. The great head of froth fell off the beer,
and showed that there was no more beer than
before and that it was very flat to boot.
J-h® boom left nothing behind it that
could be classed as desirable except some
big city buildings and a number of railways—and
even the railways were mostly unprofitable. And
it cost Australia ten years of bitter struggle
poverty and discredit to even partly make good
the loss.
* * * *
Now, for the first time since the ’Bo’s, the raw
material for a boom—the same kind of boom—
begins to show itself. The case isn’t very definite
yet. If bad seasons or good legislation should
arrive the symptoms may vanish; if there is a
succession of good seasons and the present fool
legislative system lasts, they may become aggra-
vated, and something like a repetition of the old
disastrous madness may follow. There is in the
banks a large accumulation of money for which
there is no safe and profitable outlet. The pile of
unused and unproductive gold is growing to vast
dimensions. No bank likes to refuse deposits and
decline to extend its connection, nevertheless
deposit rates have been reduced all round in the
hope of driving away money. And, despite this,
the banks haye so much money on hand -
money for which they are paying interest, but
which is lying idle and earning no interest—that
their profits are seriously diminishing. So if
the good seasons and the bad legislation continue
many things may happen.
* * *
Yet there are now, just as there were in the
SUs, thousands of things that the country might
do, and ought to do, with that surplus money ; but
the supreme folly of its legislators—which is iust
another name for its own folly—stands in the way.
It the tariff were doubled or trebled, and the
Customs free-list cut down to almost nothing, this
superfluous gold would be busy establishing iron,
copper, steel, brass, and zinc Works, making
woollen, linen, cotton, and silk fabrics, building
ships, making machinery, earning 10 Of 12 or 15
per cent, for its owners, supplying Well-paid work
to hundreds of thousands of operatives, and
keeping bitilders, tradespeople, banks, build-
ing Societies, and the like in a rush
of business—genuine, permanent and profitable
business that is, not mere frothy boom. But with
the fair wages and reasonable hours which prevail
in Australia it is almost hopeless to start indus-
tries under the present ineffective tariff, so
nothing much happens. If the great estates
were remorselessly broken up there might bh 31>,00b
or 40,000 new farmers, all With a litfclb Capital,
settling on land which is sufficiently fertile and
well-watered to be good security, Arid warttirig tO
borrow a tew millions fOr stock-, irfipleifients and
buildings bht the big laridlOrcl has the fertile
land, and there is little or no investment in that
line. If the Governments raised £2,000,000 a
year by extra taxation and devoted it to the re-
purchase of their securities in England they
would, in five years, have over £10,000,000 Of
a sinking fund ; £10,000,000 of money that is
now earning nothing for the community would
then be saving the community about £350,000
a year , and the banks would earn more for their
shareholders instead of less through the with-
drawal of this cash, for they would have less
money on which they had to pay interest to their
depositors, and on which, for want of good invest-
ments, they could earn no interest for their share-
holders. But no Government seriously thinks of
repaying anything. No Government even thinks
seriously of building new works out of revenue ;
they all prefer to borrow the money. A country
which bad some sense—as Japan has—of the ad-
visability of keeping its business and its profits
for its own people might even find a little profit!
able employment for superfluous capital in found-
ing half-a-dozen new fire and marine insurance
companies ; there would be room for them if the
horde of foreign companies were driven out. But
so far is Australia from doing anything of this
sort that the N.S.W. Government even gives its
own marine insurance business to a Chinese com-
pany. Australia is again getting into the position
of the shearer with his cheque standing outside
the door of the pub., the one building in a vast
wilderness, and not knowing what to invest the
money in, save rum.
* * » *
In the absence of any new investments, the
country has begun to paw over the little handful
of old ones with feverish anxiety. Bank and
insurance shares and the like have gone up
amazingly, even while bank profits are going down,
and this all arises out of the frantic desire to put
the money into something. Mining shares have
risen enormously, wherever there was a semblance
of excuse for a rise. The old vicious jobbing in
suburban allotments is again beginning in a tenta-
tive sort of way. If the good seasons last, and the
fool of a tariff supplies no outlet for money in the
establishment of manufactures, and the big
estates are not broken up to create an opening
for investment in genuine agriculture, and if
the Government lacks the sense to use the
surplus in reducing the country’s external debt,
there will soon rise upon the scene the old boomer
with his scheme for establishing a superfluous new
bank of issue, or a new land bank, or a loan and
finance co., or something of the kind, and he will
be followed by others. When the shares in old-
established and sound concerns run so high as to
be unprofitable buying, the public want some new
shares to gamble in, and if, under the existing
tariff, the starting of a great woollen or silk or
cotton or steel manufacturing co. means certain
ruin, they will start superfluous and parasitic
institutions which only mean possible ruin. And
if land-jobbing and share-jobbing run values up to
an absurd figure, banks will again be in the old
dilemma—they will have to do practically no busi-
ness, or else make advances on inflated valuations,
and trust to luck—the luck that always goes
amiss—to get out of the bad business before the
smash arrives.
* * * *
So far, only the beginning of the evil is upon us ;
yet already the position is a remarkable one.
Australia has some £200,000,000 of foreign public
debt to pay off—if it paid this off it would save
itself nearly £8,000,000 a year in interest. It has
factories to build for the production annually of
some £40,000,000 worth of goods which are now
imported that is the amount required to supply
the present population only, but by the time the
country had set all these factories going, its popu-
lation would be so vastly increased that it would
want to turn out £80,000,000 worth of goods
instead of £40,000,000 worth. Then Australia
has nine-tenths of its decent agricultural
land still mere sheep-walk and bull-pasture.
It has its two transcontinental railways
to build and many other things to do.
But it won’t reduce its debt and save
itself interest; it won’t manufacture largely lest
it should diminish the profits of the kind importer ;
it won’t settle the land in real earnest lest it should
disturb the great arrogant land-grabber on his
empty leagues of grass ; and it won’t build neces-
sary public works out of its own money because it
has come to think that these things should only be
done with loans. So in this backward, unde-
veloped, debt-ridden country, with enough genuine
work waiting to be done to employ a thousand
millions of capital at good interest, and to supply
work at good wages to ten times its present popu-
lation, two good seasons leave the capitalist won-
dering what on earth to do with his money. It
doesn’t require very much money to bring him to
that condition in Australia; with its industrial
stagnation and paralysis it is something like
Robinson Crusoe s isle where twopence would
have glutted the money market. And the glut of
money doesn’t help the toiler to any appreciable
extent, for in the absence of industry the money
doesn’t circulate. By reason of the tariff there are
no more factories to afford the worker employment
than there would be if there were no temporary sur-
plus, and his chance of permanently improving his
condition is much as it was. The chief signs that
there have been a few good seasons are a violent
rise in the price of shares in our handful of trading
concerns, an increased dealing in suburban allot-
ments, an increase in wild cat mining specs, and
the fact that shady individuals are beginning to
whisper to each other that if the seasons keep up a
little longer it will be a mighty good time to start
some land-banks.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Federal Capital.
The Federal capital, when it is built, should be
named the City of the Wagging Tongue If it
could be built by fluting—as the walls of Ti *oy were
said by one ancient liar to be—it would be a
splendid city by now, so industrious is the chatter
with which N.S.W. Premier Carruthers pre-
vents things being done, and so perversely
obstinate the patience with which Australian
Prime Minister DeAkin listens id that <?Mtter:
Premier Carruthkrs’ latest is to ask N.S.W.
State Parliament to make a few remarks—which
it did ; it is always willing to make a few remarks
on any subject foreign to its business —and then to
call the attention of Prime Minister Deakin to
those remarks and invite him to set the Federal
Parliament to discussing them. And so far
Prime Minister Deakin has not answered with a
brief slain-word and called for designs for buildiitigj
a Parliament House at Dalget.yi Yet the pdsitidri
has reached a stage at Which AfcFREp Deakin
must assert in SO hie, W&y the dignity arid rights Of
the uni'dri-. N. 3-. Wales was.able iri the CdnStiitif-
tiOri Met ti) secure a prdvisidn that the capital
hiust be within its bdrderS’. At the first Federal
felectioris arid <jt succeeding ones it had the right
td chddsri Representatives and Senators to
further voice its views as to the exact site.
There its rights ended. Any other inter-
ference with the Federal choice is just &S
impudent and arrogant coming from N.S; Wales as
coming from any other State. Notwithstanding,
the Federal Government of the day not only
tolerated but actually welcomed the appointment
by the N.S.W. Government of a Royal Commission
to inquire as to the best sites for the capital. The
Federal Cabinet took the amiable view that
N.S.W. would consider the subject in a broad
Federal spirit, and would know more about its
own territory than a Federal Commission. The
personnel of the N.S.W. Commission was, by
some extraordinary accident, honest and capable ;
and the Australian Parliament was in the position
of being able to endorse his choice—the Monaro—
of a site. So N.S.W. thus had the site of its own
choice picked upon. Then N.S.W., at the
instigation of Mr. Carruthees and others,
screamed horribly. It took up the attitude
of a child that wants its breakfast and
howls for it, but won’t have it, and howls for
not getting it. What is now proposed, with cool
effrontery, is that the Australian Parliament
should drop its business and “discuss” the obiter
dicta of the N.S.W. State Parliament on the
subject. Then, with equal reasonableness, the
other States might claim to put in their little
oars, and that the Federal Parliament should dis-
cuss the holes they made in the water. The idea
is so absurd as to call for sudden firmness on
Deakin’s part. Any further paltering and hum-
bugging and balking and corresponding will sim-
ply give rise to the suspicion that the Federal
Parliament is wilfully playing into the hands of
the anti-Federalists, who do not wish to see a
r ederal city in any place or at any time.
♦
Concerning 31,147 Fellow Workers*
The application made recently by N.S.W. Car-
penters and Joiners to have their wages increased-,
and their week’s work reduced from 48 to 44 hours-,
was refused—and, on the whole, it seems to have
been rightly refused—by the Arbitration Court-.
It was pleaded that there wasn t enough work to
go round, and that it was essential to reduce the
hours to make the scrap of carpentry and joinery
suffice for all the carpenters and joiners, and that
it was necessary to slightly increase the wage per
hour to enable the carpenter and joiner to live at
tne reduced hours. The only possible answer
is that, if Australia manufactured all of its
own goods that it is capable of manufacturing, in-
stead of importing more goods per head for its
own consumption than any other country on earth,
there would be abundance of carpentry and lots of
joinery. The erection of factories, and houses for
factory operatives, and shops and houses for per-
sons dependent on them, would make carpentry as
plentiful as rabbits, while joinery would blossom
like flowers in spring. While the Labor party
not only sinks the fiscal issue, but sends many
absolute Freetraders to Parliament to do the
fiscal dirty work of the M‘Millans and Bruce
Smiths, and of the Argus and Telegraph and
other enemies of democracy, and thus deliberately
prevents itself having work to do, there is no
adequate remedy for its difficulties. But in addi-
tion to this there are other aspects of the case
I lie carpenter and joiner has already got 48 hours
per week and Is. 3d. per hour. The agricultural
laborer has got something much more like 12
hours a day and 4d. per hour. It is distinctly hit
turn to be considered, and he never is considered
to any appreciable extent. His position is peculiar.
He represents the third largest industry in the
btate. through much sinking of the fiscal issue,
and through much importing and little manufac-
tunng, he has a miserably inadequate local
market and has to depend to a considerable
extent on exports. Then, to compete against
other exporters to the same market—many
of them much nearer the market and work-
mg under better natural conditions—he lias
to be one of the most overworked and under-
paid white men on earth. Nobody seriously
attempts to do anything for him. To give the
farmer’s hired assistant a chance to be a white
man, and a brother, and a decent citizen working
under decent conditions, it would be necessary for
the Labor party to rip up its whole policy and
begin afresh. It would have to help the agri-
culturist to sell his wheat to the artisan in Aus-
tralia instead of to the artisan in England, and
that would involve manufacturing for ourselves
instead of importing, and that would dig up the
fiscal issue from its shallow grave. Instead of
struggling to send to England more cheap wheat,
produced by sweated labor, m order that there
might be a sufficient surplus of exports to cover
the eternal interest bill, it would be necessary to
buy less manufactured goods from abroad, and
create the balance of exports that way, and that
would dig up the fiscal issue. The Labor party
dodges the fiscal issue by ignoring the agricultural
laborer, and leaving him out of consideration
when short hours and fair wages and the rights of
man are on the board. He is sunk as well as the
fiscal issue. Of course, it may be alleged that he
lias no union, but what chance has he ever had to
form one ? His job is so scattered and precarious,
he Wso crushed, so cheap and so hopeless, and he
is by necessity such an undefined and itinerant
jack-of-all-trades that unionism never got much
chance with him. If he had any prospect of
getting even a steady Bd. an hour for 60 hours per
week, he probably would form a union and begin
to define himself. Coghlan reports that there
were, at last census, 33,147 male agricultural
employees in N.S.W., and until some attempt is
made at the urgent arid difficult job of giving :
them a lift, the carpenters aqfl joiners, who have
already got a recognised 48 hours a week and Is.
3d. an hour, are not due for any further assistance./
If, through too much Freetrade, much sinking of
the fiscal issue and much neglect of the duty of
breaking up the big estates, the Labor party has
got into a position that it can’t do anything for
these 33.147 male fellow-workers—if it has decided
that we must keep on importing instead of manu-
facturing, and must consequently export produce
to pay for our imports, and must have a class in a
state akin to slavery so that we can turn out the
produce at a price that will enable us to compete
with even the Hindu in the English market—then
the Labor movement is on a rotten basis. That
basis is just as much a cheap labor one as was the
old villainous Kanaka system in the Queensland
sugar fields. -


The South African Horrors.
The storm in England against Chinese slavery in
Sh Africa gathers strength ; but how little
Australia is permitted to know of it The Daily
News the Morning Leader and other London
dailies give pages of insight into the hideous
Xv The News, on Sept. 20th summarised the
successive steps of the gang of Landlords who
Soled the British empire into pouring out
Xte blood and treasure for their sole advantage,
fa 1903 they told Chamberlain in an address-
Mf ur policy is pursued, there should be no open-
ji for discontent Uniortg the working classes, no
opening for that trail of the serpent the formation
oFlabor unions.” They pressed Milner, so that
in Tune 1903, he told the White League of the
Transvaal, “We don’t want a White Broletariat
while F. Hermann, general manager of the Fast
Band Proprietary Mines, exclaimed incautiously
The introduction of Chinese labor will cut up
trades unionism by the roots, Meanwhile an arti-
ficial scarcity of Kaffir labor had been created by
suddenly reducing the black boys’wages by from
33 to 50 per cent. Then the liaiidiords got their
“ ordinance ” arid flooded their mines With 50,000
ChOws ; and even flow they are not Satisfied, for
Chinese labor does riot pay. And there Was
rid necessity fdr this cheap labor. In
1898 before the war, the output of the
mines was £10,000,000 ; in 1903 it was
£12,000,000 ; but in the first tilted months
of ’O4, before the Chinese arrived, it reached
£3,77o,ooo—almost equal to the ’9B output, lhe
profits, moreover, continued enormous. Klands-
fontein Estate, Rand Mines, South African Cold
frilst, Transvaal Cold Fields and Witwatersrand
TdWnship Estate and Finance, on a total capital
of £1;478,9811, distributed a profit of £584,489 for
the first Half-year Of ’O4. But cheap black labor
wasn’t enough ; these ghouls must have still more
servile labor. They scoured Uganda, Barotzelancl,
Rhodesia, and the Portuguese territory. Egypt
was mooted, but Lord Cromer was scornful.
India was tried, but even Curzon lacked. Thus
foiled, the Landlords roped in the unsuspecting
Chow—and fell in. For in every one of six mines
employing yellow labor —Durban Roodepoort
Deep, Geldenhuis Deep, Glen Deep, Nourse Deep,
Rose Deep and Jumpers Deep—the expenses ha ve
gone up from an average of 225. 4d. per ton in 04
to 255, 7d. for the first half of ’O5; while m the
three mines employing Kaffir labor only Terreira
Deep, Grown Deep and Langlaagte Deep—the
expenses have gone down, for the same periods,
from an average of 225. fid. to 21s. But
they got their slaves. The lash flayed daily.
In the Witwatersrand mine the average number
of Chow coolies flogged daily during March, ’O5,
Was 42, Sundays included. (This London Morning
Leader published from the official records.) At
the Nourse Deep every “ boy” who did not drill
his 36 inches per shift was flogged. “ A sjambok
was used, and it was laid on relentlessly by a
Chinese policeman across the muscles and tendons
at the back of the thighs. The drawing of blood
did not matter, the policeman would go on till
the last stroke. Then the coolie was taken to
hospital to recover. On one mine alone 1000
coolies were thus licked into shape.” At an
inquest on a murdered white miner, the com-
pound manager said on oath : “ Where he had
considered the Chinamen wrong he had flogged
them. It was against the law to do so, but he had
flogged them.” Even the conscience of the British
Government began to have qualms, and "advices
were received that flogging was to be stopped
as far as possible,” New fortns of devilry were
invented. One is to strip the Chinkies
riaked, arid leave them tied by the pigtails to a
stake in the compound for two or three hours ;
another is to bind the coolie’s left wrist with a
piece of fine rope, which is put through a ring in a
beam about 9ft. from the ground. This rope is
then hauled taut so that the coolie, with his left
arm pulled up perpendicularly, has to stand on
tip-toe for two hours. “Frequently they are
unable to stand the strain, and the rope cuts into
the flesh.” Now, like the American negro, the
Chow is making desperate efforts to escape, and
but last September the Leg. Council of the Trans-
vaal offered £1 a head for recaptures —just on the
lines of the Fugitive Slave Laws. When they can’t
escape they play up. “ Last week 5000 of them
started rioting, and 100 foot police and 200 S.A.
constabulary had to go and quell the disturbance.
They threw stones and broken bottles and even
rude dynamite bombs which they had made. The
troops had to shoot into the crowd to drive them
back, wounding a good many. ’ On Aug. 31st
there were over 1000 Chinese convicts in the Trans-
vaal gaols. As for those who escape—well, in
September, at a meeting of white miners at
Johannesburg, it was decided to apply lynch law
to Chinamen accused of offences against women.
The parallel between American negro slavery and
S’African Chow slavery is about complete. And
in addition to the comparatively peaceful Chow
who was flogged and tortured into crime, South
Africa has to reckon with the great mass of
Chinese criminals, robbers and brigands, who
escaped and started to loot and murder without
waiting for any argument with their bosses. Of
all these horrors how little is known in Australia !
Even the London papers get barely half the troth,
and of that half not a tenth is allowed to reach
Australia. Is it shame for the part Australia took
in helping to perpetrate these infamies ? Or is it
that Australia shall not know what “the call to
Empire” meant ?

Judges’ Pensions.
The Bill to abolish Judges’ pensions, passed by
the N.S.W. Assembly, might just as well be
called the Bill to Secure Deaf and Incapable
Judges. Judges are appointed during life and
good behavior. At present they enjoy salaries
which reward them well, though not extrava-
gantly, and are entitled on retiring to pensions.
It is sometimes found difficult now to induce
a Judge to retire before the infirmity of old
age becomes obvious to suitors. \Vhen judi-
cial pensions are abolished, nothing short
of a grave scandal will drive a doddering Judge
from the Bench. It is only human nature that it
should be so. Admitting that Judges are, as a
rule, high-minded and conscientious men, it must
also be admitted that the average man is almost
always the last to recognise the failure of power
arising from old age. When Gil Blas, in the
course of his wanderings, was employed as
private secretary by a Bishop of great elo-
quence, it was on the strict understand-
ing that, when he noticed the slightest sign
of falling off in the Bishop’s preaching, he
was to acquaint him with the fact, so that the
Chrysostom might retire without ruining his
early reputation by lagging, decadent and super-
fluous, in the pulpit. Gil Blas noticed some
decadence and said nothing. Decadence rapidly
progressed to decay ; then he spoke. And he was
promptly sacked. We, all of us, share that
bishop’s confidence in the immortal character of
our talents. When, in addition to confession of
failing faculties, a man would also have
to face an absolute stoppage of income, it
would be unreasonable to expect of him a
d'ignttffe'd! retirement from the Bench. He would,
in some hold on as long as he could
still mumble'. In' the' public interest, therefore,
Judges should have pensions' ; a-nd it is one of the
blots of the Federal Judicial Act; that the
Federal Judges have no pension rights. And the
cry that the Judges are overpaid at present irf
NIS.W. has no good foundation. It is true that
they, almost alone of the men in the Public Ser-
vice with high responsibilities, are fairly paid.
But that only shows that the community, which
had sense enough to recognise the danger
of a cheap Judge, cannot also recognise
the danger of a cheap engineer, a cheap
architect, and a cheap administrator. The prac-
tical results are plain enough. There has never
been a serious scandal in connection with the
adequately-paid Supreme Court. But the cheap
departments have produced the useless railway,
the tottering aqueduct, the extravagant building,
and the land scandals. Cheapen the Judges and,
in time, there are bound to be judicial scandals.
True economy in the public administration would
be served, not by the reduction of the salaries of
the men who are adequately paid, but by raising
the salaries in other responsible departments, and
insisting, at the same time, on full efficiency and
honesty. The main cause of waste in this country
is that the administration won’t pay for Brains
and, as a reshlt, doesn’t get them to any extra-
ordinary extent.

The Labor 1 Freetrader Again.
The shareholders of the Ballarat Woollen Mill
held their annual meeting a few days ago, when
some remarks were made that are just now very
much to the point. Owing to the high price of
wool, and the low tariff, the company’s profits had
dropped to a serious extent, being equal to only
2 per cent, on the capital. Dealing with this dis-
heartening fact, Mr. Bell, the chairman of direc-
tors, Said}—*
Last year the' value of woollens imported exceeded
those of 1903 by £210,000; and this year, in all proba-
bility, a further increase would be found. . . . He had no
hesitation in saying that 15 per cent, protection was no
use whatever. . . . What was the use of Federal poli-
ticians advocating a White Australia when they allowed
the products of cheap colored labor to come into the
country in competition with their own manufactures ....
If the same rates of ivages and hours of work obtained as
in Great Britain they would not require any tariff at all.
Mr. Grange)!, managing director, declared that
the reduction of the duty from 25 to 15 per cent,
had made it absolutely impossible to compete
with American and English manufactures, and
said: —
How a Labor member could be a Freetrader puzzled
him.
It has puzzled The Bulletin just as greatly. The
Federal Labor members are, and rightly so, keen
advocates of decent hours, good wages, wholesome
and sanitary conditions, and so on, all of which
tend to make the factory worker a prosperous,
contented, and useful citizen ; but many of these
same Labor members seem utterly oblivious of the
fact that all these things mean a solid increase in
the cost of production. The corollary is as obvi-
ous as one of Euclid’s. Either the local manu-
facturer must be protected against the competi-
tion of manufacturers who are not hampered by
severe legislative provisions—or he must close
down and leave the workers unemployed. The
position was well put by Mr. Bell in his state-
ment that, if Australian manufacturers were as
unhampered by legislation.as the manufacturers of
Britain, “they would require no tariff at all.”
The Bulletin believes that the tide is now run-
ning against this Free trade.-Labor fraud, and it
lives in the hope of seeing the Labor Freetrader as
extinct as the plesiosaurus.
♦
The N.S.W. Usury Bill.
Hughes’ Moneylending Bill, now before the
N.S.W. Leg. Council, has drawn protests from
the kind Christian gentleman—and the unkind
Jew whose terms are generally a shade less exor-
bitant than the kind Christian’s —as to its “injus-
tice ” ; and it is freely prophesied, with lamenta-
tions that put the efforts of the late lamented
Jeremiah in the shade, that the usury business
will be ruined. That is hardly likely, but, if so,
all the better. The Bill gives a Judge or magis-
trate power to rip up a money-lending trans-
action from its very beginning and to make a
decision of an equitable nature, voiding all con-
tracts concerned, if necessary. The Bill does not
say that the rate of interest allowed shall be
5 per cent, or 100 per cent. It leaves it to the
Judge to come to a fair decision, and it is possible
to suppose that a,fair decision will sometimes mean
a very high rate of interest. But more frequently
a fair decision will mean a huge reduction in the
rates extorted from the needy by usurers, who are
generally cruel and often dishonest. The honest
usurer (if that is not a contradiction in terms)—
the gentleman with the affable manner and the
prominent nose, who lends at 20 or so per cent,
on risky securities, and is often just as
honest and honorable a man as any banker—
will not be necessaril y interfered with. A sensible
Judge will always recognise that lending on
“ personal security ” is a very different thing from
lending on a mortgage of real and immovable pro-
perty. It is the trap spider, the man whose rates
of interest before and after loaning are always
different, the man of fines, and “ commissions,
and part payment in goods, who will suffer. And
if he suffers to the point of extinction no one need
shed a tear. Mr. Hughes’ Bill proposes also to
make an effort to do away with the touting of
infant customers by money-lenders. The financial
shark often finds his fattest harvest in the
“infant,” the spendthrift lad, who is a
minor, but has “expectations,” and is anxious to
play up with some of his money in the present.
Writer knows of a case of a minor—who would
be a rich man on coming to his majority—borrow-
ing £l5O at just 150 per cent., absolutely assign-
ing, as a sort of collateral security, a life policy
for £lOOO, and lodging also with the Christian
money-lender a document to the effect that he
wanted the money for a shameful and illegal
purpose. That document was to be, held in
terrorism over the young fool if he didn’t pay up
when the time came but sought to set up the plea
of infancy. It was, of course, valueless legally,
making as it did the moneylender a participant
in any guiltiness that there might have been, but
for blackmailing purposes it was probably of some
power. That is a sample of how the usurer treats
the problem of “ infant ” borrowing ; and it is the
sort of game the law cannot discourage too
severely.
The Need for Work.
The Australian Parliament is in the condition of
a school in which there is a lazy head-master. No-
body cares very much what he does himself, and
nobody cares much what anybody else does. One
Minister or another sits at the table in the House
of Representatives, and eight, ten, fifteen, even up
to twenty members lounge listlessly in their seats,
while some one member drones stuff that nobody
listens to, and nobody records except the unfortu-
nate Hansard reporter. Except when quorum bells
are rung, there is never by any chance in the House
one-third of its membership. There is a dry rot.
And the reason of it is that Deakin has been
weak and timid enough to follow in the path that
Reid mapped out, before he finally blundered
out of office, of moving along in a “ non-con ten-
fioffis” fashion with measures that do not touch
the vital' concerns of Australia. One or two Bills
have been before' Parliament—the Trades Marks
Bill and the Commerce' Bill, for instance—that
vitalised its debates a little, bat these are in abey-
ance for the time. For the present,- everything is
futile and purposeless, but the Ministry is- content
to let things drift on from week to week. What
the Australian Parliament wants, to gal-
vanise it into doing something like the
duty that Australia pays it for, is Work.
Federal politicians are in sore need of some such
centre of energy as Kingston was. A big list of
contentious measures—anti-combine legislation,
tariff legislation, land-tax legislation, a Bill pro-
viding for the definite seizure of a Federal terri-
tory, a Bill to take over the waste area between
S.A. and the sea, a Bill to deal with the State
debts, a Banking Bill—measures that would com-
pel every vote to keep within coo-ee of the
Chamber, and drag every waiter-upon-circum-
stances into action, would save the reputation of
this ineffective Parliament. Probably it would
take little longer over some of this legislation
than it has taken over the comparatively un-
important measures it has dealt with. And in
the breathing spells of the fight, the ‘ non-con-
tentious” Bills that have made the session so
dreary and ineffective would go on the Statute
Book almost as a matter of course.

The Real Debt of N.S. Wales.
David Fell, making the best speech of the
N.S.W. Budget debate, marred it by assuring
N.S. Wales (vide S.M, Herald report) that its
debt really amounted to just under £lO per head,
whereas Canada’s was just over £lO per head :
N.S.W’s. national debt was £83,662,431, but, deducting
the value of works handed over, or to be handed over, to
the Commonwealth Government, £3,420,186, the actual
national debt was £80,242,245, or £54 ss. 7d. per head.
Against this there were national assets amounting to
£65,486,692, equal to £44 6s. Id. per head. Our debt was
therefore slightly under £lO per head, while that of
Canada was slightly over £lO per head.
On the same basis, not a bank that burst after the
boom 13 years ago owed anything at all. lhey
had all professed to have vast quantities of
assets; and out of the enormous surpluses
which those assets showed over the borrowings,
the boom banks had paid majestic dividends, and
the boom bankers had promised large sums to the
society for clothing the nigger. Then suddenly
they found out that the values weren’t real, and
the dividends stopped, and the nigger had to pull
through without the promised clothes. The situ-
ation is exactly the same in connection with
N.S. Wales’ borrowings. The State has spent
£65,486,692 on so-called reproductive works, cer-
tainly ; but if the reproductive works won’t earn
the interest, not to mention anything by way of a
sinking fund to cover wear and tear, what is the
use of fooling itself that it owns assets
worth that much ? The railways have absorbed
£49,047,720 of the £65,486,692 ; and that, except
the comparatively small amount spent on
water supply, represents the most profitah.e
part of the debt. Yet in the past 14
years this most profitable part of the debt
hasn’t earned its own interest by £2,301,413. In
the past four years alone the railway deficit has
been £1,214,483. In 12 years out of 14 there has
been a deficit; and when year after year an asset
can’t pay interest on its capital cost, there is only
one thing to be done —to say it isn’t worth that
much, and write down its value. On the basis of
the last four years, instead of earning interest on
£49,047,720, the N.S.W. railways have only been
able to earn interest on £38,000,000;
this shortage in the value of £11,04/, 1 20
would add just upon another £lO per head to
the public debt. The money spent on water
supply and sewerage is earning interest, but
it isn’t also earning sinking fund ; and,
whatever can be said with regard to a
railway improving with age, and with the develop-
ment of the great natural resources, etc., it can’t
be seriously claimed that a water-pipe is improved
by being fifteen or twenty years underground. A
business undertalcing would therefore steadily
write down the value of its mains, plant, etc. But
the State, having spent £10,416,884 of borrowed
money in this department, goes on cheerfully
assuming that the pipes are as good as new ; and
David Fell loses his grip of things—merely m
order to be affable, it seems—and countenances
this idiocy. The only other alleged reproductive
business in which the State has put Cohen s
money is the Harbor Trust; and exactly
how the Harbor Trust’s accounts stand nobody
knows. But whoever is right in the, wrangle
which is proceeding over this department’s figures,
this anyhow is agreed : it isn’t earning interest
either. For the past year the Trust itself says it
had a deficit of £9234, and the Auditor-General
calculates that it had a deficit of £10,064; and
again there is no provision for a sinking fund, in
spite of the fact that the Sydney Harbor Trust
Act provides for a sinking fund. Bringing to-
gether the whole, of the services on loan
money has been spent, Cogiilan shows (“Aus-
tralasian Statistics,” 1904) that for that year the
works and services earned £1,778,016 above work- .
ing expenses. That was an unusually good result;
in 1903 the net earnings were only £1,509,572.
The actual interest paid was £2,841,368. lhis
left £1,063,352 to be paid in 1904 out of taxa-
tion_or loans. In other words, in even a
good year, as much of the debt as is
represented by an annual interest charge
of £1,063,352 in unproductive, and, from David
Fell’s point of view, is real debt. Capitalised,
on a 3'55 per cent, basis (the average interest pay-
able in 1904), this unproductive debt amounted to
£29,954,000, or £22 per head of the population.
And that is on the figures of the year when the
loan undertakings gave about their best results.
For the previous two years the unproductive debt
was vastly greater. Even, however, supposing
David Fell’s figures as to this matter were right,
what then ? Supposing the State did owe only £lO
that wasn’t represented by reproductive assets,
what then ? Would David Fell feel comfortable
if he had every stick and stone he possessed mort-
gaged, and owed £lointo the bargain? The position
can’t be glossed over ; it is so bad that the attempt
to say something affable amounts almost to a
crime. And so far as N.S.W. is concerned it is
still nearer a crime when it is remembered that,
besides having borrowed this money and having
now nothing reproductive to show for well nigh half
of it, the State has also sold about £52,000,000 worth
of its assets in the shape of land. If the loans had
been put into permanent and reproductive works,
as the cacklers say they have been, and if the
assets that have been sold had been put into other
assets, N.S.W. should now have —and ought to
have—nearly £4O worth of reproductive assets per
head in excess of its loans ; and the lamentable
fact is that it has at least £25 per head of a deficit.
In other words, it has somehow fooled away £65
per head, which is an appalling record, and doesn’t
permit of any excuse.
The Nigger and the Kingdom of God.
Apart from Bruce Smith, who hardly counts as
an ordinary human being, there are now very few
opponents of a White Australia left, and. the
visionary and impracticable parson seems to con-
stitute the bulk of the remnant. The lone and
irreconcilable reverend is generally to be found
calling out on the side of accumulated wealth, a,nd
he has a profoundly irritating habit of professing
to base his demand for sweating, and cheap and
servile labor, and the destruction of the white
worker on the grounds of high moral snuffle,
which high moral snuffle he seldom, by any chance,
applies save in the lopsided fashion which serves
his and the Fat Man’s argument. As an instance,
one Parson Worrall recently filled in an Un-
pleasant Sunday Afternoon in Melbourne with
logic like this ; —-
He contended that any man who had the right to enter
the Kingdom of God had a right to enter Australia.
And Parson Worrall left it at that. He might,
of course, have gone on to s&y tluit &ny man who
had the right to enter the Kingdom of God had a
right to enter on the property of the Chirnsides,
or the Manifolds, or the Clarkes, instead of
being prosecuted for trespass, or warned to
“Beware of the Dog,” or at the least required
to pay an exorbitant rent to the land-grabber.
But he didn’t, for that would have offended the
landlord, and though the humble white workman
doesn’t matter to parsons like Worrall, the rich
landlord matters “ something tremendous. There
are no ground rents in the Kingdom of God, so
Worrall might have pointed out the consequent
iniquity of ground rents here, but he didn’t. He
might, as he was speaking in Melbourne, have
said that every man who had the right to enter
the Kingdom of God had a right to enter
the Victorian Upper House, but that would
have shocked the Legislative Chamber which is
reserved for the Rich, and he took care not to.
He could even have remarked that as all men—
even the nigger from India —were equal m the
Kingdom of God, they should be equal on earth,
and that consequently the British Parliament,
which denied the nigger the same self-governing
rights as a white man, was lost. But that might
have made the “loyal” section of the audience with-
hold its threepence, and Parson Worrall passed
that question by as if it were a bone mill or a
quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen. I Ins habit
that many parsons have of seeing clearly that God
ordained that all men should be free and equal
The Days of Stinking Fish,.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Australia’s finished talking
And Australia’s got to work,
When the Tories cease from baulking.
And their tasks nor longer shirk,
They will say that they’ve forgotten*
That they e’er expressed a wish
To declare the place was rotten
In the days of Stinking Fish.
Then the cables will be whirring
At the way Australia booms,
And the atmosphere be stirring
With the shafting and the looms ;
When her sunny smiles are winning,.
And we treat her as she’s worth,
And we set the spindles spinning,
And Australia clothes the* earth,.
When the final Foreign-trader'
Has his mouth for ever closed,
And the Tory serenader,
Like his fish, is decomposed,
We will daily smile and wonder
How the poor weak creatures felt
When they used to yell like thunder
At the way the fishes smelt.
With a clean and open city,
And a bush that’s not a gaol,
And the children strong and pretty
Where they puny were and pale ;
When there’s healthy, full employment,
And there’s plenty and to spare,
I here’ll be time for the enjoyment
Of the sunshine and the air.
All will have the chance to labor,
All will have a time to play ;
While the timbrels and the tabor
Sound throughout the holiday •;
And the beaches that they swim in
Will be loud with laughter then
From the brown deep-bosomed women
And the tall, broad, brawny men.
They have brought to bear their forces,
Now they’ve done with dreams and doubt,
On t';e Natural Resources
That they used to talk about ;
And the loafer foul and squalid,
And the rich and flabby one,
Are applied to labor solid
By the Children of the Sun.
With the chances they are giving,
And the science that they teach,
All the farmers g t a living
Out of 50 acres each.
Where the landlords used to squat on,
Irrigation bubbles forth ;
And the rubber and the cotton
Clothe the ran ges of the North.
We are blazoned to our bound’ries
As the golden wheat-ear lifts,
And the glowing, grimy foundries
All are working triple shifts,
While the sturdy youths asleep ’ll
Take our work up in the morn,
For we’ve forty million people
And they’re half Australian born.
We’ll have sixty thousand hatters
And can laugh at Tory tricks,
For it mighty little matters
What our fathers thought of Six.
As they shift their wordy venues
And declare that such a dish
Ne’er was placed upon their menus
As a plate of Stinking Fish.

GAIL-AHER UP BELFAST- TO N® TRUST 01? COMBINE
when it is a question of some cheap nigger’s free-
dom and equality to rob a white workman of his
job, and their other habit of never seeing any need
for freedom and equality when it is a question of
depriving the rich white landlord of his class privi-
leges, leads the workers, not unnaturally, to regard
the parson as the rich man’s dog; and unfortunately
religion is too often judged by its abject and dog-
like parsons.

The Nefarious Widow and Infant.
A Bill to provide for the maintenance of widows
and young children of deceased persons will come
up for second reading before the Vic. Assembly
this month. Clause 3 embodies the purpose of the
pih —“ If any person disposes of his property
either wholly or partly by will or codicil in such a
manner that upon his death his widow or children
or any of them are left without sufficient means
for their maintenance and support, the Court may
. . . order such provision as to the said Court
seems proper ... to be made out of the estate of
such deceased person towards the maintenance of
such widow and children.” Mackinnon and
G. H. Bennett are the fathers of this
measure, and presumably Bent will put
no difficulties in its way. It is a de-
sirable measure so far as it goes, but the
curse of half-heartedness is upon it, as it is on most
Australian legislation. The widow and young
children are not to get their means of support as
a simple matter of law, but are first to go to the
Supreme Court, and dissipate the property in
costs, and provide a bite for the undesirable and
unproductive legal shark. This is done appa-
rently for fear the widow or the young children
may be unworthy, but even if they are unworthy
they have as much right to be supported out of
the old man’s estate as out of the public funds.
The old man is dead, and has no further use
for the estate; and he may have been just
as unworthy and undesirable as the widow
and the infant; and even the most unworthy
widow may have helped materially to build up the
estate. Moreover, if the law compels a man to
support his unworthy wife and his wicked infants
while he is alive, he might as well do so after he
is dead. Again, even if the widow is unworthy it
is a very bad widow who is half as unworthy as
the legal shark who will often, under the
Mackinnon and Bennett Bill, get most of the
property. And as a matter of public policy the
widow, however bad she may be, and the infants,
however nefarious they may be, should get their
share every time without any legal procedure. It
is for the good of the State to promote the general
diffusion of wealth, and it is better that a large
estate should be divided up among a bad widow
and six villainous children than that it should
be kept together and handed down intact
to the most sanctimonious nephew on record.
If, as may happen at times, the wife and
infants are so incurably vicious that it
seems really necessary that they should starve
after the old progenitor’s death, he can always get
square with them by spending all the money in
his lifetime, and finishing his own career in the
Benevolent Asylum. If a man wants very badly
to starve his widow he shouldn’t hesitate to starve
himself a little, so that that desirable end may be
brought about.
The High Commissionership.
Why is there a dark silence in the Australian
Ministerial pronouncements as to the appointment
of a High Commissioner? The first Parliament
should have undertaken this task as one of its
initial duties. A High Commissioner was part of
the essential machinery of the Constitution ; the
Commonwealth fell in dignity and prestige when
its first Act went to .London for approval and
found there no official to champion its principles
and to urge its wisdom. What Australia has lost
in independence, in influence and in population
and money, from the lack of a representative
in London can hardly be o/er-calculated.
What was the reason of a delay so preju-
dicial to the interests of the Commonwealth?
The question may be linked with another as to
the delay in creating a High Court. In each case
the motive was poor and dishonorable. The post
of High Commissioner was wanted as “bait.”
More than one unsuitable person was allowed to
believe that he was to be the lucky person, just as
more than three thought that they were cer-
tainties as judges. The Bench was formed only
when the possibilities of the Bench as “bait”
were exhausted. The High Commissionership, it
is alleged, is not going to be filled until its value
as a worm on a hook is ended. To the Barton
Government, which had used the High Court as
“bait,” succeeded the first Deakin Government,
which might plead its short and stormy career
as an excuse for not doing anything, but
which, nevertheless, could have swept away the
scandal of this dangling of the prize if it had
had enough honesty and courage. It certainly
lacked the courage; possibly it also lacked the
honesty. The Watson Cabinet would probably
have been defeated on the High Commissioner Bill
if it had brought it down, on the plea that a mere
‘ ‘ Labor ” Government should not have the making
of so big an appointment. Still J. C. Watson
missed a great chance in not putting that issue to
the test. He, too, lacked courage. G. H. Reid
was sincerely anxious to pass the Bill and fill the
post, but Parliament didn’t want him as High
Commissioner. Now Deakin is back in office and, if
current reports are true (the strange silence of the
Cabinet on this point, in a measure, suggests their
truth), the High Commissionership is again “bait,”
and will remain so until the death of this Parliament
is close at hand. One section of the Cabinet favors
appointing Reid, not because he will serve the
Commonwealth well, but because his absence, it
is thought, would serve the Deakin party pretty
well. Another section including at least one
Cabinet Minister favors that loud public
calamity, John Forrest. There is said to
be one other Minister who is a candidate.
All this is a matter of common talk, and of fairly
definite knowledge. It is a sordid and scandalous
state of affairs if the interests of Australia are
being sacrificed to serve the interests of the party
Whip. And there is only one way to show that
it is not so ; that is by making the appointment
during this session.

Carruthers’ Three Federal Capital Sites.
The demand of N.S.W. Premier Carruthers
that the Australian Parliament—having already
u ? n the Dalgety site for a Federal capital—
should go back on its tracks and “consider”
three sites which he offers, is a remarkable one,
even for that tiresome little political insect.
Years ago, in the time of Prime Minister Barton,
the N.S.W. Government was asked to offer some
possible sites for a Federal city. There was much
negotiation, and at last the N. S.W. Government
“reserved ” certain sites, including Bombala and
Dalgety. This “ reservation ” was the only form
of offer that could be obtained. The Barton
Ministry would have been much better advised if
it had not consulted the State Government at all,
but that is another question. As soon as the Dal-
gety site was selected—not before it was selected—
by the Australian Parliament, Premier Carruthers
withdrew it and induced the State Parliament
to back him up. Then he “offered” a choice
of three other locations. If the Australian Par-
liament could, by any possibility, be so foolish as
to go back on its decision and accept one of these,
the possibility is that Carruthers would with-
draw that also and howl the wild laugh of a vacant
mind over the humor of his action. In all
his dealings over the matter he has shown
his petty love of authority by being always
in opposition, and apparently he doesn’t realise
that lus inability to keep faith has by this time
put him outside the pale of negotiation, and that
no decent politician values his political promises.
After his withdrawal of the Dalgety site as
soon as it was accepted, no reliance can be
placed on any offer or assurance that he can
make, and no Parliament in its senses is going to
negotiate on the basis of any promise of his. But
at least Carruthers has cleared up one point.
His conduct shows the absolute necessity of having
a sufficiently large Federal territory to give the
Australian Government command, not only of its
own city, but also of its own water supply and
water catchment area. If it accepted the sort of
minimum area which some of the Carruthers
crowd have frequently proposed, it would be de-
pendent on the adjacent N.S.W. territory for its
water supply, and when it struck another Premier
like Carruthers its water supply would probably
be cut off, merely as an assertion of “Stateßights.”
State Rights, ’ in the bright lexicon of Carru-
thers, seem to consist mostly of the right to break
faith and to behave like the overgrown bully of a
boys’ school.

Chairman Kater, M.L.C., of the vast Colonial
Sugar Refining Co., has poured out his half-yearly
lamentation to the shareholders, who have only
been able to make £267,665 profit during the past
year as against £178,803 five years ago. The
Federal Parliament, he wailed, won’t come to any
decision about the bonus on “ white ” sugar, “and
the difficulties of the cane-growers in the North
are increased by the impossibility— as the law
stands—of introducing agricultural laborers from
Europe if the removal of Kanakas be enforced.”
And many of the shareholders will probably be-
lieve this nonsense. There isn’t anything in the
law to make the introduction of European agri-
culturists “ impossible.” The agriculturists can
come, and the co. can even pay their passage
money if it wants to ; all that the co. has to do is to
persuade them that there is work to be done in
Australia, and that i t is a concern that will see them
treated decently when they do come. All that it
can t do is to bind them to accept certain wages
and conditions before they know what it will cost
to live in Australia. As soon as they are here,
and have seen what the conditions are, the co. or
the cane-growers can make whatever agreement
they and the laborers please. There is absolutely
nothing more to prevent laborers of good character
coming to Australian than there is to prevent
capitalists buying C.S.R. shares. The capitalist
buys shares, and trusts to the directors to pay a
dividend; but the directors won’t guarantee a
dividend —shareholders have to come in and trust
the directors. A.nd that’s exactly how laborers
can come in. If it’s “impossible” for laborers to
come in on those terms, it is also impossible for
anybody to buy C.S.R. shares.
Does anybody know the principle on which
deductions and allowances are based in the Public
Service? A schedule to the N.S.W. Estimates
has been issued showing how much some officers
get more than their salary, and how much less
some other officers get. One striking thing is that
the person who works around Parliament House
never suffers deductions—he always gets his
salary, and generally something on top of it.
Parliament likes to have round it people who are
fat and don’t grumble. Also, if a man is high up
in the service, he rarely suffers a deduction. The
Inspector-General of Police, at £lOOO a year, gets
another £l5O “in lieu of quarters and light
and rates.” But the nurses at the Rook-
wood infirmary (and scores of others), getting
their £9O a year, have to pay £25 a year for re-
maining on the premises—for sleeping with their
work, so to speak. The Superintendent of
I isheries gets £65 because the Government doesn’t
supply him with a house; the Director of the
Botanic Gardens is mulct in £lOO because he is
supplied with a house. There are hundreds of
similar cases. Presumably there’s some system •
but the only visible net result is that Isaac
M-osenstein, who buys a blue-book, with a list of
salaries, and then reckons he knows the exact
financial weight and substance of every civil ser-
vant, doesn’t know nearly as much as he thinks he
does.

The climaxing effect in ‘ ‘ Merely Mary
Ann ”, still progressing favorably at Her Majesty’s,
Sydney, is troubling some travelled artists.
Launcelot, who expects to be a baronet some day,
won’t marry Mary Ann when she is Merely ; but
when she becomes Marion with half-a-million, he
will. Whereupon Marion says it’s impossible,
rushes off, makes a change into the apparel of
Mary Ann, cast off seven or eight years before,
re-appears, and says if Launcelot has her it must
be as Merely M.A.; and Launcelot winks (any-
how the situation calls for a violent wink)
and takes her that way. The change from
silks to prints, from fashionable head-gear
to the slavey’s cap, would do credit to a
quick-change artist; and the question is, “Do
you strike quick-change artists in real life ? ”
On the other side of the water, when Marion
rushes off and reappears, it isn’t in a com-
plete change of frock—she is content to slip on the
cap and apron of the old Merely days. And that
seems by far the more probable and more artistic
effect of the two. As a matter of fact, it is in
small artistic details, which in the mass bulk
large, that Miss Tittell Brune is weakest—in those
delicate little touches which a brainy artist like
Brough, for instance, packs into his performances.
But, as a laugh-maker, “ Merely Mary Ann” still
reigns triumphant. Even people who didn’t back
the right horse on Tuesday found that there are
still humor and laughter left in the world. When
this piece has had its run, there will probably be
a revival of “Romeo and Juliet”—say, in about
a fortnight’s time.
* Jfc *
With “ The Mockery of Marriage ” staged
at the Sydney Royal on Saturday Mr. Anderson’s
Co. got back to the usual run of melodrama. The
“Mockery” is a sensational yarn which ranges
from the Klondyke goldfields to one of the London
underground railways, where, to satisfy the popu-
lar demand for a strange method of attempted
homicide, the heroine is thrown on the railway
line, and rescued from her peril by a troupe of the
Acrobat Tribe which—in melodrama at any rate —
haunts railway tunnels. Probability has long been
divorced from the bed and table of melodrama ;
there is a new development in England of working
out sensational stories on possible lines (“The
Great Millionaire ” is an example) but it doesn’t
seem to be over-popular. The public which
patronises melodrama wants a strong brew of
fiction, with at least one new method of
murder; that given, it is satisfied. It is
useless to quarrel with such a definite public
wish or with a theatrical management for
satisfying it. But manager Anderson should
insist on his actors paying more attention to
details. In this drama the hero, as a soldier, is
never dressed correctly, and the villain, as a noble
lord in shooting rig, uses his gun as a walking-
stick and as a leaning-post in a way which raises
hopes (doomed to be disappointed) of a fatal acci-
dent. Such details are in themselves trifling, but
accuracy in small things is of importance in help-
ing a story to an air of probability.
* * * *
Acting in “ The Mockery of Marriage ” is
generally good. In the absence of Miss Duggan,
her part as principal has been capably taken by
Miss Ada Guildford. Bert Bailey, as a yokel
with a tired feeling, bears the burden of the
comedy interest; and the Silvenis, a specially-
engaged troupe of acrobats, add to the interest of
the production.

“Providence guided you to this island that
I might be the means of saving your life,” says
Miss Rose Dampier (Sylvia) to convict Rufus
Dawes (Alfred Rolfe) in the ‘ ‘ Term of His Natural
Life ” (revived at Sydney Criterion on Saturday
night). Later, when the false charges and fresh tor-
tures accumulate, and all seems black as the Pit to
the hunted convict, Mr. Dampier, as the Rev. Mr.
North, assures him that “Providence has your
case in His hands, and He will see justice done.”
Then Sydney recognises that Providence works in
a mysterious way His wonders to perform,
for Rufus has such a bad time here below
that no after happiness could make amends. Story
ends happily in the play. In Marcus Clarke’s
book Providence was evidently on the side of
those who flourish like the Scriptural green tree.
The Dampier family, save Lily, are in the cast of
“His Natural,” playing with their usual ease, and
Mr. E. Holloway, as Mat Gabbet, gives his
watchers great thrills. The Dampiers pack up
their belongings and hump their bluey to distant
parts on Saturday next, so those Sydneyites who
have not yet seen this piece will have to hustle
themselves, or else they’re likely to miss the
damper.
* * * *
A special announcement is to the effect
that Miss Lily Dampier, supported by a powerful
company, will make her re-appearance, by special
request, in a new version of Mrs. Henry Wood’s
world-famed work, “East Lynne.” The Bul-
letin sympathises with Miss Lily, and would, if
it could, spare her some of the tears necessary for
the weepful role. As it is, this paper will go and
weep with her. The new season begins at Sydney
Palace Theatre on Saturday next.
** * *
J. C. Williamson’s Gilbert and Sullivan
Co. opens a six nights’ season at the Criterion
on Saturday night next. As it has only
time to play one piece, it has chosen “The
Gondoliers,” which ought to prove specially
acceptable to Sydney at present, when most of
the city is going daft over motor launches and
water picnics.

The plague of small brown moths, which
break the gaslight mantles and then hide in the
soup, has been followed by an outbreak of rabbits
and poultry at Sydney Tivoli. These latter arrived
with Leroy, Talma and Bosco from Melbourne—a
“ team ” of most artistic humbugs, who do nearly
all the best things that all the other wonder-
workers do, and pack the whole lot into a quarter
of an hour or so. Most of the others, when they
want to make their elaborate preparations for
another trick, hire a flickergraph to show how
Little Eva Chased the Goat, or something of the
sort, and Eva and the Goat fill in 20 minutes
while the humbug is arranging for a trick that
lasts three minutes. The beauty of the “team”
arrangement is that when Leroy isn’t on the stage
Bosco is ; and when Bosco goes, Talma comes; so
the unnecessary Eva and the superfluous Goat don’t
make anybody yawn. It’s the brightest, smartest,
whirlingest item of the sort manager Rickards
has ever introduced ; and, joined to the other
extra-good attractions, it deserves the crowded
houses that the Tivoli is getting these times.
VISIBLE EVIDENCE.
“Do you mean to say that you really believe
McGinty dreamt the winner of the Cup?”
“Faith, an' it's th ’ gospel truth; Oi seen him
dream it meself! ”
Everything at the Melbourne theatres this
week is a well-worn revival, with the exception of
Bland Holt’s seasonable Horstralian melodrama.
“ The Betting Book,” or the Penitent Punter, has
leanings in the direction of novelty. No melo-
drama appears strikingly new to the eye which
has followed a hundred leading villains to their
downfall in the fourth act, but the plot in this
case is about as new as a thick coat of local color
can make it. Also. Brunton’s fine scenery depicts
the land we live in and the tote-shop which is
talked about by Bent’s Parliament. Take it alto-
gether, “The Betting Book” is a welcome con-
version of old-fashioned British drama to modern
Australian requirements. And it abounds in
warnings to misdoers. The husband who backs
losers doesn’t have a swift and easy repentance, like
the ordinary young man gone wrong at Melbourne
Royal. His agony is prolonged for 14 years, dur-
ing which time only the good girls of the piece
retain their, youthful charm. Styan, the villain,
comes to grief hereafter as well as in this life, for
a small and virtuous she-boy kneels at Miss
Ireland’s knee to pray that the bad man may he
shut out of the Kingdom, and the prayer of the
stage infant invariably availeth much. “The
Betting Book ” as aforesaid is full of beautiful
morals. Baker in his character of a genial loose-
gaitered squatter, seems to be moderately full of
beer. Anyhow, his request for more beer is grace-
fully declined by Miss Pollock.
*m * *
At Her Majesty’s (Melbourne) a revival of
“Paul Jones” and Miss Florence Young was
announced for Cup Night, so, if nothing has
happened to delay the lady’s return from foreign
parts, she is doubtless snorting defiance at Rufino
whilst The Bulletin issues from the press.
“ Paul Jones ” will retire again on Friday, and on
Saturdaj the new comic opera—“ Veronique ” —is
to show good cause and reason for its first-class
reputation. Something unlike the usual musical
comedy-medley is expected from “ Veronique.”
** * #
All these weeks the Williamson Bio-Tableau
has been flickering gaily at Melbourne Athenaeum
Hall. This week, the principal features of the
picture-show are the ‘ ‘ Motor Mad ” series and
Flemington on Cup Day. Sometime next week
the operator will pack up his films, and the ener-
getic orchestra will be heard no more.
** * *
Another innings of “Sweet Nell” at
Melbourne Princess’s is a further reminder that
the orange girl who secured a reputation by losing
her character is a more demonstrative charmer


than when she first came to light on the same
stage. Miss Nellie Stewart has hroadened the
comedy business to suit that section of the audi-
ence which laughs loudest, and, to the general way
of thinking, her admirable performance of yore
has been disimproved upon. The later accentua-
tions and embellishments have lessened the
charm of the' play. Still it remains a very
gay and sprightly work of fiction,
Melbourne heaves a sigh over the advt. stating
that Friday of this week will be its last night
Perhaps for ever. Many stage heroines and
heroes less unvirtuous than Nell and Charles could
be better spared for an indefinite period. Miss
Stewarf; and the Musgrove co. are to appear m an
American comedy next Saturday (11th)- Humor
credits “In the Bishop’s Carriage with startling
peculiarities and freaks of Yankee fancy.
** * *
For a few weeks only, Melbourne Bijou
has raised the shutters of its pay boxes. George
Stephenson’s co.—mainly the same co. that was
at the Princess’s, but partly otherwise is rush-
ing “The Skirt Dancer” along in an earnest
endeavor to make the management happy’. Man-
agements at the Bijou are not joyful as a rule.
The fact that a tenant has arrived upon the
premises with a bright little show will probably
gather publicity as Cup time goes on, otherwise
“The Skirt Dancer’s” nights will be fewer than
was intended.
*# * *
Wirths’ Circus (the approach whereto is a
path of beauty) started the third week of its
boom with a change of programme, not because
the previous programme wanted changing, but in
order to impress those deserving persons who
come often to the tents. The persistent patrons
have to crowd in early on the busiest nights if
they want a seat. Wirths are doing great busi-
ness, and when the sacred elephant has sized up
the audience, he looks demurely down upon his
trunk, like a parson who lias got a crowded chapel
and wonders what the collection will amount to. It
can’t be the Death Trap item alone that draws
the multitude! The off-chance of being in at
a Death is a strong attraction, of course, but the
man who saves his life on a bicycle, is but a brief
thrill at the end of a long entertainment, and if
the Circus were not -high above the average the
public would-be mostly content to stay away
and let Chefalo, the Demon Looper, shuffle off his
mortal coil in their absence. After all, he never
does die.
** * *
At The other Circus—the Eroni Bros., in
Fitzgerald’s building—a young woman slithers
along a wire,', hanging by her pearly teeth the
while, and at Princes Court the Daring Dastro is
now wreathing himself in flames before he bikes
furiously down a steep place and Leaps the
Chasm. .Just now there would doubtless be a
large demand for a Reckless Richard who climbed
to the top of a lofty pole and fell off promiscu-
ously—provided that a fatal accident were guar-
anteed.
#* * *
The new people at Melbourne Opera
House are the Brunins, late of Sydney, also Hill
and Whittaker from the same Tivoli, and Fred
Graham with Miss Nellie Dent. There are some
other recent arrivals, but the billiard-table
jugglers, and the musical lady who sings the fetch-
ing coon song, and the Graham sketch, have to do
duty for the principal “ turns” of a week earlier.
They do it fairly well, and it isn’t their fault that
the departed turns were record-breakers. Boy
Glen and Ryder Slone are happily among the
people who didn’t go away last week.
** * *
The Stephenson Opera Co. cleared out of
Adelaide Tivoli with a farewell evening of variety
turns —and indeed “The Dandy Doctor,” its last
piece, was-not'..much else. Rickards has come into
his own house for a short season of “ specialities.”
The Royal remains closed, but is polishing up its
front door knob for an early re-opening. The
Adelaide Choral Society has given Handel’s
“ Solomon ” for the first time in this city, also the
better known “ Acis and Galatea.” The roller-
rink ran a brief season in the absence of opposition
from the real-ice rival; but both have now closed
down for the summer.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ S.S.” : A correspondent (B. 26/10/’O5) declares, on his
word of honor and the authority of a distinguished expert
—the greats man’s dresser—that the legs of Julius
Superbus, in “ The Sign of the Cross,” are Marcus Knight’s
own particular, personal, and proper legs. If that be
true, will the gentleman ascertain whose legs they were
that Julius Superbus walked on when he played Beaucaire
and David Garrick? The legs of Marcus'are massive,
with solid lumps of muscle on them ; the legs of Beau-
caire and Garrick are decidedly spindled. I don’t assert
that the doleful Knight pads his shanks to play the
noblest Roman of them all ; but I do say that he spoke-
shaves them to support Garrick and Beaucaire.
“ Millewa ” : I went to see the Knight-Jeffries “Monsieur
Beaucaire,” and found that the rage for a happy ending-
had cut out the most pathetic and artistic episode in the
book—the parting of Lady Mary and the pseudo-barber,
when he returns to the one heart in France which would
never have doubted him. . But in the play’ the curtain
drops on the princely hair-remover and the reigning
beauty in the conventional “happy ever afterwards”
attitude. This gives an entirely false impression of the
character of the title-bearer, too proud to be accepted for
his positipiß and too keen not to perceive the veering-of
the fair Carlyle at the knowledge of the 27 patents of
nobility recounted by the faithful minister to the applaud-
ing crowd of Bath pump-room tuft-hunters.
The Chow is few and far between in Australian theatres,
but he is a valuable and discriminating patron of the
circus. And yet John is dreadfully afraid of the
man-eating animals, and rushes his half-caste family past
the cage of the royal Bengal tiger with the air of a man
who knows it is loaded: The other night at Wirths’,
when the gate of the iron-fenced ring was opened to pass
in some “ props,” while the tigers were loose within, one
excited paternal Sin Fat jumped up amongst his family
in the two-shilling seats, screaming: “ Wha’ for? Wha’
for?” And although the gate was promptly shut, Sin
collected his brood in haste and agitation, and fled the
place. John takes no chances.
“ Edyson ” : On the say-so of “ Yarrab ” (B. 26/10/’O5)
Suderuiann is nothing- better than a carcase butcher who
flings his corpses on the block for the playgoing public to
make the most or least of them, while Ibsen is a skilled
surgeon, who exposes every’ nerve with scientific truth.
So that “ Magda ” is little better than a murder case,
while “Ghosts” is an elaborate and craftsmanlike bit of
dissection. Ido not disagree with “Yarrab ”in his esti-
mate of the hairy’ Norseman, but I think his opinion of
Sudermann shows a plentiful lack of discernment. The
German, to my thinking, is a skilled dramatist, a close
student of human nature, and always develops his idea
courageously, broadly’, logically’, and with excellent art.
To say that Magda and that fine old conventional
moralist, her parent, and that living, vivid, commonplace
old aunt cause merely a remark and leave no impression
is something in the nature of denying the existence
of the equator. Can “ Yarrab” tell us of two human
lives born into stag'eland in Australia within the
last 10 y’ears that are more alive than the stormy Magda
and her God'-and-Grundy-fearing papa? And if Suder-
mann has made these people so real and so intimate
without great art, then great art would appear to be
wasteful and ridiculous excess.
Irving is the first mummer to be buried in Westminster
Abbey because he 'was a mummer. True, Ben Jonson
preceded him, but Jonson gained admittance to the
sanctuary’ as a poet only. Let us think : In the beginning-,
the Stag'e was the handmaid qf the Church, but the devil
seduced the maid—at least, so the Church said, and the
Church pretended to regard her with loathing' for a few
centuries. Now, the Church inurns the ashes of the
leading English-speaking actor of his time in its holy’ of
holies ; and, where are we? Has the Stage repented and
come back to Sunday-school, or has the Church gone to
the devil, or has the devil g'one to Church and put his tail
in the collection plate ?
The betting-play’, staged just now by Blandolt at Mel-
bourne Royal, is advertised to contain “ beautiful pictures
of well-known Australian localities.” Lower down in the
advt. comes the following, list: —
ACT 111.
Scene I—Melbourne’s Seamy Side.
Scene 2—Exterior of a Wood Yard.
Scene 3—The Tobacconist Shop.
Scene 4 —Corridor to “ Tote ” Room.
Scene s—The Tote.
Scene 6—lnterior of the Wood Yard.
Scene 7—Poverty Point.
The mouth of the Yarra, the West Melbourne swamp,
and the exit of the main sewer are beauty-spots that were
inadvertently omitted.
ONLY POLITENESS.
DEAKIN (to British farming class generally): “ Yes, as head of the Australian Government, I
inrite you, on behalf of that Government, to come in your thousands and occupy our
Australian lands."
FARMER (gruffly): “'Ere, ye said that afore. What bloomin' lands are you or your Govern-
ment able to offer? ’Are ye any? ”
DEAKIN : “ Well, I must say just at present, none; but may I not be polite?”
Poor little A. G. Spry, quaintest of Kickardian come-
dians, is having a real hard row to hoe. He suffers from
lung" trouble, and'came to Australia again in the hope
that our bright warm summer would patch him up.
Ever since he arrived, however, he has struck bleak, cold,
shivery weather, and has been in the doctor’s hands nearly
all the time. David Grant, the Melbourne lung specialist,
looks after him, and, after six weeks in bed, during part
of which time his condition was posted as critical, he was
patched up enough to struggle on and do his turn. The
little man is still very tottery, though.
“Melb.”: Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis (Rose Edouin) was
Madame Deschapelles in the “ Lady of Lyons ” for the
last night of the Knight-Jeffries co. Almost the first play
I saw was Byron’s “Lady of Lyons” burlesque, at
Ooppin’s Olympic (the Iron Pot), with Rose Edouin as
Claude Melnotte. Rest of the cast included: Pauline,
Rogers ; Widow Melnotte, Fred Younge ; Beauseant,
Dunn (father of Rosa Dunn and Mrs. Marcus Clarke). I
remember two lines of Younge’s part:—
Well, arter much reflection, 1 consider
It’s wery ’ard indeed to be a widder.
Young returned to London, where his friendship with
Tom Robertson caused him to be the original George
D’Alroy in “Caste.” He perished in a railway accident.
Great effort of the Andersonian muse, from a Sydney
Theatre Royal advt. :—
“ Bail up—bail up ! ” the outlaw cried. “ Your hands
above youf head ! ”
“Unhand me, villain!” wailed the maid. “Oh! save
me, Captain Fred.”
“ You shall be mine ! ” the villain hissed ; “ you yet shall
be my wife ! ”
“ Is it weally true ? ” lisped the jackeroo. “ Is this weal
Australian life ? ”
“ Unhand me, villain ! ” is strikingly original.
“ Joseph and His Brethren ” was lately produced at the
London Coliseum as a mystery play—but where is the
mystery ? When George Rignold staged a reverend gent's
“ Joseph of Canaan ” it didn’t profess to be other than a
romantic, spectacular, Biblical drama, with a streak of
blue in the act where Potiphar’s wife wanted to put her
dark Egyptian head on the Hebrew’s shoulder.
Consider the mummer how he wilts in a strange situa-
tion. Nobody would ever suspect Julius Knight of
nervousness; yet, the other night, when he,got. off his
pathetic little speech of farewell to a Melbourne audience
he destroyed about 2s. lOu. worth of good blue silk sash
by twisting it around in his fingers while he touched a
chord in every heart. Julius Superbus’s few well-chosen
remarks were all as carefully prepared as those with which
he tells Tigellinus that he’s no gentleman, but he had
omitted to fix up the stage directions and gestures, and
accordingly he had to tear his clothes as he went along
to fill in time.
Percy Fitzgerald, who published a monograph on Henry
Irving in 1893, possesses a unique collection of press
cuttings, photos, caricatures, etc., comprising everything
concerning Irving (so he says) published during the last
26 years. The collection fiiis 21 huge folio volumes, and
will probably he used now to help in compiling a
biography. But this patient pursuit by a literary parasite
after his host has something uncanny about it. In all
these years Irving must have been almost afraid to glance
at the window lest Fitzgerald should be looking in, and
every time he heard a noise overhead he must have fancied
it was his faithful and tireless biographer on the roof
taking notes through the skylight.
“Lil”: Melbourne Princess’s advt. became quite
mournful the other day over “ Sweet Nell.” “Farewell
to the dear old play, perhaps f r ever,” it sobbed. But
why not give the play anew lease of life by introducing
fresh features ? For instance, we could have Charles 11.
in his celebrated performance of making love simul-
taneously to Nell Gwynne, Lucy Walters,, Louise de
Keroualle, Peg Hughes, Barbara Palmer, Fanny Stuart,
Hortense Mazarin, Moll Davis, Catherine Crofts, the
Bulkeley, Rochester, and Middleton charmers, and other
members of his harem whose names have not come down
to posterity. What a chance for sentimental acting !
And what a pleasing variety entertainment could be intro-
duced by the impersonators of some of these Court ladies,
who were so fond of dressing themselves in male attire !
One of them boasted of “ the pleasure I find in knowing
that my leg's are perfect, and beat those of any other
woman in existence.”
Louise de Keroualle, Duchess of Portsmouth, off whom
Nell Gwynne scores frequently in “Sweet Nell,” was by
no means a favorite with the other ladies of Charles ll.’s
seraglio, who resented her enormous influence over the
so-called Merry Monarch. (He seems in reality to have
been a melancholy individual, who was glad to have the
sprightly Nell to bring him an occasional dash of sun-
shine with her quips and cranks.) When Louise sustained
a black eye, possibly through Charles throwing one of his
spaniels at her, the others alleged that she was trydng
to gradually turn herself into a brunette, because that
was the complexion-tint of her latest rival, the Duchess
Mazarin. But Louise went steadily on her way, drawing
more money than any of the others (£136,668 in one year),
and providing enormous pensions for her descendants,
the Dukes of Richmond.
“0.F.” : In a stationer’s shop, heard a small girl, who
had been looking at actress post-cards, inquire : “ Please
do you keep man actresses ?” The term seems to fit the
beauty type of he-mummer like a skin.
“ T.D.” : Re the early-door system at Sydney and Mel-
bourne theatres, and the managerial contention that
booking tor all parts of the house would preclude the
disposal of bad seats. In the modern theatres of London
and provinces there are no bad seats. Some are better
than others, but managers have at last awakened to the
fact that there shouldn’t be any seats from which the
performances cannot be properly seen. Why this fact
didn’t dawn on the very forerunner of all theatrical archi-
tects isn’t quite apparent. Anyway, when there are good
seats throug'hout a house, the general booking system is
possible. London Coliseum has proved the innovation a
good one, and had the show itself been an enjoyable one,
instead of a series of exhibitions of the incapacity of
played-out stars, the results would have been better still.
The Waldorf, where the idea has also been tried, did not
secure large audiences during its recent season of
opera, but they were larger than a queue system
would have broug'ht. All its operas were stale ; Covent
Garden had used the best of them in the fortnight before
the Waldorf opened. Talking of bad seats, by the way,
Covent Garden accommodates twice as many people as
any Australian theatre, and every seat in the ordinary
plan affords an excellent view of the great stage. In
what are known as the “gallery slips” there are seats
from which it .is never pretended-that a view can be
obtained. Patrons go to the “slips” to stand, and they'’
use the seats to rest during intervals.
“ T.D.” : How the Australian does bob up ! Have found,
during recent extended travels in England and Ireland,
that it’s impossible to g’o into a town of any size without
dropping on two or three people from Down Under whose
names are billed big on posters to do something or other
of a public nature. When in Belfast, f’rinstance, found
“ Bleeds ” Fitchett telling how he won the Hempire ; local
natators were welcoming swimmer Kieran with a big
tournament ; and at the Hempire that Fitchett doesn’t,
write about, Marion and Clara Llewelyn, two singers
who possessed a high' reputation for thiir artistic
work in Sydney eight or ten years ago, weie doing a
nightly turn of operatic selections in costume, an 1 help-
ing to raise the standard of musical taste among patrons '
of the ’alls. At Bridlington, Yorkshire, I found Mary
Conly, of Melbourne, warbling at concerts, Daisy Davies,
of Sydney, starring- in “ The Cingalee,” and another Aus-
tralian stage-managing the same. Incidentally, T was also
on the posters. And at every town of over 20,000 inhabi-
tants, the first thing to greet the eye is inevitably the
name of some pushful Australian.
As others (say they) see us. In the biography of Mel.
B. Spurr, by his brother, is quoted a letter wiitten by the
late showman from Melbourne. “ They have a funny
way of introducing you here. They say, ‘ Mr. Spurr,
shake hands with Mr. Eustace Smith,’ and you do.” This
is told apropos of a reception at Glen and Co.’s show-
rooms, at which “ the elite of Melbourne ” were present!
Alfred Dampier made his professional debut at Strat-
ford-on-Avon, at some distant period, as the Player King
in “ Hamlet.” After much provincial experience he emu-
lated his exploring namesake (whose portrait used to
figure prominently at Melbourne Alexandra during
Alfred’s tenancy) by sailing for Australia. He opened at
Melbourne Royal in September, 1873, as Mephistopheles,
in his own version of “ Faust,” to Eleanor Carey’s
Marguerite. Among the many works of Shakspeare and
Dampier which Alfred has produced since then, one
remembers with'joy “ Wilful Murder,” put on during the
height of the Deeming excitement, with a real hearth-
stone and quantities of real plaster for the disposal of the
remains of the lady popularly supposed to represent Mrs.
Deeming. But this minor effort of Shakspeare’s was only
put on because the public did not respond quite as well
as it should have done to Alfred’s good work in the hard’s
other plays.
“ Ailath ” : Re “Adelaide” par. (B. 12/10/’OS). In
Bland Holt’s drama, “ For England,” Frances Ross has
words with the villain, Noriiian. The quarrel goes to a
fine accompaniment of bullets ringing outside the fort.
Then she flings wide open the fort door and bids the base
scoundrel depart to the enemy’s lines. Bad Norman
suavely yarns in the entrance for some time, then departs
as told. Not one shot smites the air after Frances opens
the door, and the battle only resumes when she closes it
on Norman. The Boers had the good manners, anyway,
not to interrupt a lady's conversation.
A Dentistry and Stag'e Guild would not be out of place
in Melbourne. The two damsels —Irene Dillon and Addie
Hine—who danced so cleverly in The Players’ show, at
the Princess’s, were both of them fathered by tooth-
smiths, and Mrs. Green had another very promising pu] il
who is also a dentist’s daughter. Ernest Fitts was a re
pairer of the public tooth before he took to comic opera.
Horace Stevens, the principal basso of the Melbourne
concert platform, is a dentist, with a father and uncle in
the same profession. A few years ago a dentist got into
financial difficulties as lessee of the Royal. The deft-
handed practitioner who to-day operates upon more teeth
than any other man in Melbourne, is an expert conju.or
with a strong leaning to showmanship. A taste fer the
stage runs in the dentist blood seemingly.
“ Thorold D.” : Sabbatarian Australians (a wild contra-
diction in terms) would have their eyes opened and their
intellects broadened were they to see a present-day
Sunday in London. On Sunday afternoons the Londoner
has his choice of a dozen or more big public in-
stitutions, like the British Museum, the Ken-
sington Museum, and the People’s Palace, and they
are all thronged. The patrons of the People’s Palace
have a library and two free organ recitals at their dis-
posal. Scores of smaller institutions round the Great Fog
also fling their doors wide open on the Sabbath. The
Sabbatarian, especially the Melbourne variety, would he
inexpressibly shocked to hear that there is a regular sys-
tem of concerts in and around London on the Day of Rust,
where leading artists may be heard, supported by great
choral societies and orchestras. Every Sunday during late
autumn, win terandearly spring, the AlbertandQueen’sand
other central halls are filled withconeert-loving multitudes.
Conductors like Dr. Cowen and Wood, artists like Ada
Crossley, Andrew Black, and John Harrison do pro-
grammes ranging from Wagner and Tschaikowsky to the
harmless necessary British ballad. Each raw winter
Sawbath, probably 25,000 people thus enjoy good music.
The Sunday League has also made fresh air possible on the
Day of Dust. One of Fogtown’s gladdest sights is the
departure about midnight on Saturdays, of special cheap
and fast excursions to places where the jaded worker may
get a fresh breeze and give his smoke-laden lungs a
chance. On Sunday mornings the spectacle repeats
itself.
E. T. Smith, sire of Melbourne’s L.L., lost no chance of
advertising his theatrical ventures. When he was run-
ning an Italian opera co. at London Her Majesty's, in-
cluding such stars as Piecolotnini, Tietjens, and Giuglini,
with Arditi as conductor, he invited the leading members
to drive with him to the Oaks. Things were going merrily,
though bystanders seemed to be staring rather more thaii
usual, when it was discovered that E.T. had had an enor-
mous placard advertising the co. affixed to the drag
before starting'. The Italians objected to advertising in
the manner of the bearded lady and the six-legged calf of
the freak show ; and the removal of the placard and much
abasement of Smith were necessary to persuade them to
return for that night’s performance. But E.T. had got
his little ad.
“ The Prooshan ” : I pulled up in front of a roadside
pub, near Wagga, at 7.30. As I alighted from the trap
a long ghostly-looking individual rose from the verandah
stool, where he had evidently reposed during the previous
night. He had struck the belt of calms, and was the
sorriest-looking recovery I ever gazed on. Striking an
effective attitude, he touched me on the shoulder and said
in a deep voice. “My deah sarr, if you will buy me a
glass of be-ah, I will render you ‘ The Heart Boad Doan.’ ”
He got the be-ah, but I declined the “ Heart ” with thanks.
If any one has recently lost a long spectral actor with a
beer-longing I guess this object is his property.
“ E.M.K.” : I once travelled from Broken Hill to White
Cliffs with a dramatic co. We were three nights out—fed
on tinned meats. One morning, about the time that the
roosters are supposed to rend the atmosphere and cast
reflections on St. Peter, we were startled by an apparition
doing- a song and dance around the remains of the fire—
the mechanist had ptomaine poisoning. Returning, I
was roused one night by the sound of revolver shots. One
of the passengers was chasing the driver round the camp
and firing over his head—for fun. It’s a bright, interest-
ing journey’ from White Cliffs to Broken Hill,
An English paper refers to Laureate Austin
as the poet who sang of the British flag waving
“as inflexible as fate ” ; of a British sceptre that
would never “fade”; and of Queen Victoria
as dying and leaving “ a widowed world.”
The 58-vear-old hulk Menschikoff, used
for coal storage at Lyttelton (M.L.), is to be
broken up. It was built at Baltimore, and sold to
the Russians, who armed it and sent it to Bala-
clava harbor, where it was captured by the British
during the Crimean War. The boat had a varied
career privateer, slaver and trader, and on
arriving at Lyttelton from Sydney 20 jAars ago it
was seized for debt.
On view last week at Sydney Parliament
House was a voting machine, an ingenious piece
of mechanism which ought to make the return of
the audacious elected person an easy matter —if he
gets the votes. It is a long, narrow box, on one
side being a series of buttons, under 'which the
names of the candidates are placed. Each button,
when pressed, will record a vote. On the other side
there are pieces of tape connected with each button,
and numbering from 0 to anything not exceeding
a million. On pressing one of these buttons a
bell rings, and causes the corresponding tape
to register one. The mechanism of the machine
is so arranged that the returning officer
can set it to prevent plumping. If the
dial is set to four and ■ you only vote three
times, or if you vote four times for the same can-
didate, the bell won’t ring, and the returning
officer will know that you have not voted properly.
Again, the machine can be arranged to allow
plumping. There is no toilsome counting or re.
counting of votes. You set your machine, befor e
polling, at zero, and when voting is finished brea] c
the seal covering the figures, and the correct nu m .
ber of votes recorded is shown. The total cost 0 f
the machine is said to be somewhere about £lO.
The fat Tory isn’t the only one whose in-
tellect—dull and weed-choked—prevents him see-
ing where his real advantage lies. T’other day
Melbourne Trades Hall Council refused to join in
a demonstration against the American Harvester
invasion, or to take part in a deputation to ask for
higher*duties. The present higher duties move-
ment in Melbourne is being engineered by the
Protectionist Association and aided fmanfully by
Trenwith and Manger, among others; but, not
being solely a Unionist movement, it is, in the
Trades Hall view, anathema. There seems to be
a lot of the Tom Mann policy about Australian
Trade Unionists—the small trifle of work that
is here must be divided as far as it will go,'
hut there is very little attempt to ensure that
all the work Australia requires to be done shall be
done litre.
THE BAND IN MOORE STREET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I hear the band a warning throw
Down in the sunlit air below ;
And crash into that sombre din—-
A booming dirge of “Lohengrin ”
In very thunderstorm of woe !
Then comes a strain, love-laden so,
My heart’s forgotten roses glow—
Dear “ Annie Laurie ” and her kin
I hear the band !
Tis finished ! and once more I know
What folk are passing to and fro ;
What Time is thinking, hand on chin ;
What flowers are selling ; but within
Where Memory hangs a tremulous bow,
I hear the hand !

Sydney Watchman— which only last week
proudly billed as its chief item the “Scathing
Exposure” by the just-bowled-out Rev. Woolls
Rutledge of Romanism in the Public Service, the
said exposure being altogether of hisown mistakesor
false-hoods —has been flaunting in its office window
two eggs—a huge one and a very little one. What
relation the eggs are to Dill Macky—what con-
nection they have with the cause which is haunted
by Popes and sees priests in its liquor—isn’t
exactly explained. Is that huge egg a mare’s egg
found in one of the Dill Macky mare’s nests? Or
is it the latest Popish conspiracy being hatched?
Or does it illustrate the size of egg all fowls would
lay if all Romanists were cleared out of the Public
Service and went into poultry farming? Or has
it any relation to the rooster which made unkind
remarks to Peter—the man who is said to be
mostly responsible for the R.O. Church ? The
egg has surely something to do with the Scarlet
Woman : else the Watchman, one would think,
would have nothing to do with it. .Possibly it is
a pun—a horrible practical pun—and refers to the
eggsposure of Woolls Rutledge. Or perhaps the
large egg represents Dill Macky’s opinion of
himself, and the small egg represents the com-
munity’s opinion of Dill Macky,

The perpetual ruction about the unpopular
baby took on a new phase at Footscray (Victoria)
lately, where a registered nurse desired to hand
over a left infant to the State. The State, per
the police, declined it, and told her to take out a
warrant for the arrest of the mother, who was
“supposed to be” in N.S.W. ; but the J.’sP. told
her they could not issue such a warrant, and she
would have to keep the incubus. But she was a
determined nurse, and after much argument the
bench offered to issue a warrant and chance its
being any good. Then ensued a great turmoil over
the 5s duty stamp. Mrs. Gamp declined to pav for
}*• , i l l h , e l Chl ® f Commissioner of Police, she said,
had told her the warrant would not cost her any-
thing. But the clerk of court said he wouldn’t
issue the warrant for all the Chief Commissioners
m Australia unless he got ss. in advance, as other-
wise he would have to pay for it out of his own
pocket, so there was again a deadlock. Finally
the nurse departed, saying she would resign her
registration and so force the police to take the
infant from her. Australia is alleged to want
population badly, yet there seems to be a fearful
row whenever the said population comes along
and somebody has to look after it.
The Westralian Government recently im-
ported at a cost of £4OOO a steam lifeboat, and
named the craft after Bigjohn’s good lady. The
other Sunday a boat containing two men capsized
at the entrance to Fremantle harbor, and the men
remained clinging to the mast for a couple of hours
in full view of 300 or 400 people. Several attempts
were made to rescue them by small sailing boats,
but there was a rough confused sea running, and
they nearly shared the same fate. One of the men
at last let go his hold and was drowned ; the sur-
vivor was taken olf by a small Government steamer
which had to get up steam before moving out.
The swagger lifeboat, it turned out, was up the
Swan River on a picnic—one of the recently elected
Ministers having secured it for a party of friends.
It is often away on such-like Ministerial jobs and
jaunts. Which is so like the way they do things
in Old Groperdom. Such an episode would wreck
the Ministry in some countries.

“Geo. H.” : “Yarrum” (B. 26/10/05)
thinks the “Fiji uncle” is often a joke. I met
the nephew once in Sydney. lam sure my other
two “ friends ” meant business, but, as a battered
and sinful man of the world, the nephew struck
me as a joke, being an ordinary Woolloomooloo
pusliite, and an unkempt one at that. Also his
roll of flimsies was altogether too large for a man
with any respect for the set of his pants. Proba-
bly he was a makeshift. My “friend” was
taking rue and his other friend to see a meat-
preserving factory at Forest Gate. He left us to
“run round and see the manager first.” The
manager being away, our visit was off, and we
adjourned to a nice quiet pub. Subsequently the
nephew happened. He was, as I said, a very
poor nephew. Either he was the best available
or they judged me by my looks and put me down
as an idiot. Anyway I felt hurt at being held so
cheaply, and left them drawing straws or matches,
or something.

“F.” : The story that Syd. Gregory told
in the Bankruptcy Court last week touches the
old, old question as to whether medical men are
entitled to squeeze large incomes from a class of
patients whose financial weakness gives them a
reasonable claim to hospital support when they
are sick. “ Gregory said his wife had paid money
to doctors and for living expenses. His wife told
hnn that it cost £3OO for sickness, £l3O going in
two weeks for doctors.” And the man who
pockets the big fee is more often than not a minor
factor in the success of the treatment he gets all
the credit for. Ihe distribution of the reward is
absurdly inequitable as between the qualified
practitioner and the trained nurse. The watchful,
smiling, tireless woman at two or three guineas a
week is really “pulling her patient through,”
whilst Dr. Bounce comes along occasionally,
rewards the sick room with his appalling* presence,
and says, “Yes, we are doing very nicely.” It is
he who is doing so nicely, getting, perhaps, a
heap of guineas for prescribing for a case of
nei ves, in which all the work of mental minis-
tration devolves upon the tactful angel in cap and
aprons. Trained nurses, of course, are angels—in
the sick-room. Very devils of girls when off duty
maybe, considering that human nature has a ten-
dency to average itself, but the sick person sees
nurse always with a halo round her cap.

T for th . e British navy, except as a
Jack Tar, is evidently reserved for the pluto-
cracy. An Australian having
a bright little boy, 11
years old, wrote for in-
formation re entering
him as a cadet. The
regulations forwarded
showed, first, that
the Govern or-
General alone
could nominate
cadets from
which class all
officers are
drawn; a

ly easy ex-
animation
would be
set; but the
trifling sum
of £75 would
have to be
paid yearly
to the Ad-
miralty au-
thorities
during the
four years of
training, with
the addition of
pocket money,
washing and re-
pairing bills, etc.,
to about an equal
amount. It would thus
cost nearly £BOO to reach the
giddy altitude of a “middy,” when £5O and
pocket money, etc., would be the parent’s yearly
expense.

It appears that in some respects there is
little to choose between Rhodesia (S’Africa) and
St. Kilda (Vic.) as places of residence. In both
what might otherwise be a monotonous existence
is occasionally enlivened by the incursions of wild
beasts. In Rhodesia the diversion is provided by
lions. In St. Kilda a councillor’s cows play the
part of lions. So at least a lady ratepayer com-
plains. She alleges that one of these savage
creatures, several times ejected from her flower-
garden, lay in wait a few days later and attacked
herself and her sister in the public street, hurling
both to the ground, “ where it danced in triumph ”
upon two prostrate lady ratepayers. And when a

Something humorous in the way of a Stink-
ing Fish hawker was allowed to wander over the
type in the South China Morning Post office on
August 29. The paper prints the yell under the
headings “Labor party ruins Australia: A
word with an Australian.” The alleged Aus-
tralian, who said his name was Hollingworth, and
is described as “ manager of a company of artistes
who have just arrived in the colony,” remarked
with the usual diffidence of the barn-storming
advance-agent that he loved his country very
dearly and had studied its politics down to the
roots, and it was going to the dogs. “ The Labor
party is in power,” he explained, and “the most
free and ideal form of government has been prosti-
tuted and debased till it has become a tyranny” : —■
The carter may not touch a package he has conveyed
to your door ; a bricklayer cannot handle a pail of water
which he may require for his job.
This magnificent perjurer doesn’t stop to explain
who does “touch the packet the carter has con-
veyed to your door,” or what he should want to
touch it for after he has delivered it, anyway; he
rushes along to dig up other horrors :
The last enactment seems to sound the death-knell
of commercial development, for in the course of a few
years the Kanaka will not be allowed on the cane planta-
tions. I can only anticipate that the plantations will
have to go, and wheat must take the place of sugar-cane.
What we shall do for labor I don’t know, for the
aboriginal—now useless—is rapidly disappearing; and
even skilled British artisans are denied entry into the
colony.
Australia, it seems, has adopted many devilish
devices. Well, it badly needs to think up just
one more—a suitable thing to do to the gnats who
talk this sort of thing to our neighbors, and call
themselves Australians when they talk it.

A Gippsland woman went to a Land Board
the other day, to apply for a holding, but just as
her case was being called she fell dead. This
shows the possible results of shock when a desir-
able block is made available for selection in much-
landlord ed Victoria.

N.S.W.’s Joseph Carruthers has decided
that the indigent person who becomes an inmate
of the State asylums for the infirm shall be practi-
cally imprisoned. , The poor old men used to be
allowed liberty to walk the streets of Rook wood
and Parramatta (in the neighborhood of the insti-
tutions). That was a grievous affliction in the
nostrils of a few tpney folk, and the Director of
Charities has issued a ukase that no inmate shall
afflict with his presence public streets or parks on
public holidays, Sundays, Wednesdays and Satur-
days, and on other days the duration of leave from
the overcrowded warrens of humanity shall not
exceed two hours !
London war correspondent F. A. Mackenzie
points out that the gentle Chinaman combined
pleasure with profit by plundering the wounded
and dead on the Russo-Jap battle-fields, first com-
mitting sickening atrocities on the living in the
way of mutilation. Gouging out eyes and hack-
ing off ears were some of the milder forms of
amusement. Mackenzie investigated various
charges of mutilation made against the Russians,
and “in every instance careful inquiry demon-
strated that such horrors had been committed, not
by Russian soldiers, but by Chinese ghouls, eager
for plunder, and not under the control of either
side.” And this is the dear gentle John, of Bruce
Smith and other Colored Australia cranks !
DISGUSTED.
“Yes, Billy, I'm gettin' full up of this country
after the V.R.C. treating Jack Wren like
that; and I’ve a good mind to clear out and
never come back, iust to show them what I
think of it.”
A Melbourne business man explained how
he came to be an accessory before the event. He
was hastening home in the evening when he ran
against a miserable-looking wretch who was beg-
ging. To his surprise the fat citizen recognised in
this lean, ragged, grimy lurcher a man he had met
in affluent circumstances in Adelaide, with a
handsome home, a handsome income and a hand-
some wife. Finding himself recognised, the mendi-
cant put up his price, and begged for seven-and-
sixpence. “It’s all I need to lift me out of this
degradation,” he said. The merchant was softened
and parted three half-crowns. In the Herald of
the following evening was a half-column account
of an outcast who had blown his brains away with
a revolver. At the inquest a pawnbroker deposed
that he had sold the second-hand weapon to the
deceased for 65., and an ironmonger’s assistant
stated that he had sold the man cartridges to the
value of Is. 6d.

Oh, moping moujik, with your patient face
And fat, unwieldy body, sleeping there
Upon the box ! A sight in any case
To move the gods to pity—if they’d care.
You pass athwart my vision, perched aloft
Upon the seat of your so dirty carriag-e
A bulgy vision, wide and gross and soft ;
Nor could I.picture you as nice in marriage I
Yet 3‘ou yourself are lord of this gay town !
For what would languid Russian ladies do
If'once you struck and crawled from that box down ?
Indeed you crawl when you are up, ’tis true.
But say, 6 moujik, if you should decline
To drive those weary officers round town,
The deed would be a wonder and a sign,
And deep and loud the curses at you thrown.
But be at rest, Oh tired aristocrat!
For dear old Dirty Face is still asleep,
Nodding his stupid head. He is so fat
That his circumference almost makes me weep.

Melbourne Hospital shooed from its doors
as drunk John Jack when he was dying of
apoplexy. John Jack had many friends and the

thing in a lilac frock gently pressing his fevered
brow. The police, fearful of mistakes, take their
drunks to the hospital. The drunks are drunker
than they used to be, and the surgeons ilsofeartul

Those returning Dowieites who supply
such remarkable tales of the horrors of the city of
Zion seem to have come back almost as simple-
minded as they were when they left. They
departed because they were taken in by an angry,
bellowing, abusive, whiskered fraud —such a pal-
pable fraud that the confidence man’s rich uncle in
Fiji is a rock of coherent and feasible circum-
stance by comparison. And they come back so
surprised that their palpable fraud should have
proved a fraud that they feel it necessary to tell
everybody of the astonishing circumstance. They
have discovered that this particular nephew
hadn’t any rich uncle in Fiji, but they seem still
to regard him as a shocking exception. The fact
that no nephews have any rich uncles in Fiji—
that the uncle-tree doesn’t grow there at all
hasn’t dawned on them even yet.
THE RULING- PASSION.
FALLING INDIVIDUAL: “ Say, what ’orse won the
Cup ?”
The evidence given in the three abortive
trials of Reuter’s clerk Farrelly shows up private
enterprise in a most unpleasant light. Farrelly,
at 23, with 10 years’ service in the company, was
paid the noble wage of £B6 a year: a similarly-
situated clerk in the Commonwealth Postal De-
partment would have got not less than £l4O a year,
and might have got a good deal more. Also,
neither the Postal Department nor the Pacific
Cable Board charges the public for more words than
are actually sent by cable or telegraph, though
Reuter’s manager, Collins, admitted on oath that
his company did thus “ get at ” the public.
The smoke hadn’t stopped coming out of
Stanford Merthyr (N.S.W.) colliery tunnel, after
the explosion, when the yarn began to circulate
that some discontented workman had been re
sponsible for the damage and the loss of half-a
dozen lives; and when two or three coal-miners
representatives in the Assembly referred to the
rumor, and demanded a full inquiry, the daily
papers headed the report —“Angry Labor Mem-
bers.” If they hadn’t been Labor members, they
wouldn’t have been called angry ; they would
have been called “indignant,” and the papers
would have asked where there was a shred of jus-
tification for the promiscuous slander. As it was,
the slander ran on for close upon a week, till the
electric current at the switch fused the mechanism
in one of this same colliery’s offices, and “ had no
one been there the building would probably have
been burnt.” As the same current led through
the mine where the explosion occurred, it seems a
fair thing, after that, to hang the malicious-work-
man theory up for a while—until some more evi-
dence can be got, anyway.

Newtown (Sydney) has had another stone-
throwing case. A house was subjected to fierce
bombardments, and when at last the luckless
little nurse-girl was allegedly lamed by a junk of
road-metal, the police were called in. They sus-
pected the girl herself of being, the culprit, and
watched her, but to no purpose. Then the dining-
room sofa, sideboard, and curtains all took fire
simultaneously, and the police declared that it
was either the nurse-girl or spooks. Sure enough
the child confessed under cross-examination, and
was sent to a home for five years. The mania
among small Mary Anns for throwing bricks mys •
teriously at a kind employer’s premises is a phase
of the servant-girl question which has not yet
been dealt with, and it is to be hoped that Sydney
Telegraph will write itself a letter, signed
“ Overworked Domestic,” on the subject.

A piece of unconscious sarcasm was prof-
fered to the beaks at Melbourne City Court lately
by an old woman whose sole crime was poverty.
She had besought the police so persistently for
shelter of any sort that at last they locked her up,
and the' honorariums, being tired, or knowing
the futility of trying to hunt up an asylum for the
old dame, gave her 12 months’ hard labor. Then
she said : “ Thank you, gentlemen, for your
charity.” Is there in the world another city the
size of Melbourne where the sick or aged poor
deem it a charity to be gaoled for a year with
hard labor ?

The celebration of Trafalgar Day, though
perhaps more excusable than that of Empire Day,
mostly consisted of saddening
antics of mayors and other self-
exhibitors, ignorant platitudes
about Trafalgar Bay (there’s no
such place, the battle being fought
off Cape Trafalgar) and perse-
cutions of deluded school kids.
In Ballarat, for instance, the
scholars of all the schools assembled
on Saturday morningto be marched
to the City Oval, where they were
to assist in the show. This meant
in some cases a tramp of three or
four miles. None of the kiddies
took lunch, as they had been told
that refreshments were to be pro-
vided. After much rag-flapping,
hoorooing, and comic history, came
some very inferior bike-racing, etc.,
but no lunch. The hours went
hungrily by, but, though Mr.
Mayor and his cronies came forth
well-filled and jolly after a pro-
longed retirement, not even a
sandwTcl? SppgSfSd £SSF,'
cold, empty kids. they lmng
round till nearly dark, and then,
all hope as dead as Nelson, made
a limp break for home and mother.
Those lucky enough to possess
tram-fares raided the nearest bun-
shops. The rest went wailing
homewards to spread the dismal
tale; and next morning the local
Courier told the victims that they
had been “ regaled with toothsome
delicacies.”
Melbourne policemen as a crowd
are a decent enough lot of men, but they
don't like the farm-burners from Africa
who have been drafted into their ranks.
Neither does the public. Accordingly,
when the farm-burners applied for per-
mission to wear on their tunics the rib-
bons they had received for gore in Africa,
the police authorities jumped at the
idea. By the left breast of his tunic you
may now know the man who burned the
piano in the Transvaal. Thus he flaunts,
with an effrontery that only a Boer baby-
frightener can assume, the badge of his dis-
grace. The public walks round him on tip-
toe for fear of being arrested on a charge of
insulting behavior, and sick men give him a,wide,
berth lest he should run them in as drunk -and
disorderly. “He stared insultingly at the ribbon
on my breast ” will be the next cause of offence
brought against some poor devil whom a B6er-
looter drags before Panton, P.M.

Creswick (Yic.) produced a sensation last
week. Michael Murphy was to have been married
to the girl of his heart at 7 o’clock in the evening.
The wedding did not eventuate, however, for at
11 o'clock in the morning Michael blew his brains
out with a revolver he had bought a week before.
Police inquiries showed that he had not enough
cash to provide a home for the chosen fair one,
and took the long way round out of his difficulties.
At least Michael might have fixed himself a week
earlier and saved a lot of wedding-day bother.
Perhaps he was expecting to win a Tattersall’s
sweep or to be left a fortune in the last week. Any-
how, the inquest showed that he finished up
smiling and did the character of the happy bride-
groom to the last.
Something unusual in the way of a main-
tenance case drifted into a Maoriland inagis-
trate’s court lately. The lady, who was drab
and middle-aged, gave the details of her brief
married life so incoherently that the court
wanted to know if she was sure she was
married at all. She said yes, but couldn’t
tell whether the alleged pastor was Angli-
can, or Scotchbyterian, or Salv’army ; nor
had she any marriage lines. At last it
transpired that the man had put up a
mean jest on her, promising to marry
her for 3s. worth
of beer. Alleged
that she had as-
sumed that the
beer consti-
tuted a mar-
riage, and had
left things at
that. At all
events, the
court had to
tell her that
she was too
indefinite, and
she went away
in search of
evidence, o r
vengeance, or
more beer, or
something.
Saida “colonial
experience ” Johnnie in a
city saloon : “Dem youah Aus-
tralian sense of humah. Ai
don’t understand it. Ai was
having dinnah at the little inn
at Pitchiloola, and they were
talking of jumping hawses. So
Ai began to tell them that
story of mine about the wagah
mai uncle, the Earl of Fitz-
broke, made with mai cousin,
Lord Bucktooth, that he
would jump his huntah ovah
a sft. fence with a ditch on
the othah side. Ai was just
telling how the Duke of Haw-
borough had agreed to hold
the stakes, when a rough,
hairy person interrupted and
said, ‘Pass the mustard.’
And, when Ai passed it quite
civilly, they all roahed with
laughter. Then some fellah said
it was Coleman’s best, and they
roahed again. Dem it all, Ai say, what’s the
joke ? You chaps are a lot of silly asses, you
know.”

The Law in Victoria took up a hole or two
in its belt the other day, and rolled up its sleeves,
and waded in to create a new precedent. The
trouble concerned three lads, aged between 16 and
20, whom that eccentric individual, Police Magis-
trate Read Murphy, found guilty of assaulting a
girl at Kilmore. The P.M. rounded on the three
(and on their fathers) with great violence, but as
he said he didn’t wish to make criminals of them,
he ordered the court to be cleared of all save
police, lawyers and parents, and gave the
latter the option of walloping the boys there and
then. Otherwise it would be £lO or three months.
The fathers accepted the first offer; so “the
P.M. sat on the bench while the culprits were
stripped and treated to 25 strokes each ’ with a
stirrup-strap. Even this flagellation—practically
a public flogging—doesn’t appear to have fully
met Mr. Murphy’s views, for, when it was over,
he fined each delinquent ss. and costs, and added
48 hours imprisonment on bread and water —by
~ .-- : .■ - i . ..f tl> after all.
'■way or making criminals t
Possibly this remarkable Police Magistrate thought
he knew what he was doing when he put himself
almost on a level with the common hangman, and
flagellator, and virtually broke the law in ordering
a public castigation—or perhaps he forgot himself.
He doesn’t seem to have passed any definite sen-
tence of flogging which could be appealed against
as illegal ; as far as the reports show, the three
servile fathers simply flogged their sons till the
person on the Bench told them they might leave
off, and then the formal sentence followed. These
fathers ought to have told Mr. Murphy that, as they
were not called as witnesses, they declined to
stand in the box and be lectured by any violent
P.M.; that they declined to act as his public
floggers ; that he could be his own flogger, and do
it at his own risk; and that his alternative
sentence being quite illegal would be appealed
against. The right kind of father could have con-
sfderably shaken up Kilmore that day.

“ L.” : Re Melbourne suburban J.P. who
was reproved by a prisoner for sentencing him to
twelve months’ imprisonment when legally he
could only award three months (B. 26/10/’O5). In
a north-of-Yarra police court, the other day, I
heard the court orderly ask a prisoner
whether he desired to question the con-
stable who had just given evidence against
him. “He can’t doit,” snapped the shockingly
ignorant J.P. who was presiding; “he can only
make a statement.” That particular prisoner had
no wish to ask questions, but the incident made me
wonder how many accused persons are robbed by
prehistoric relics on the bench of their right to
interrogate the arresting constable. But, anyway,
many of the honorary fossils seem to pay very
little attention to the evidence. The ruling of
the average J.P. depends on the amount of awe
the accused displays in the presence of the
honorary one’s fair round stummick with dyspepsia
lined.
THE AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE OF THE
TURF.
DASHLEY (hurrying to collect his winnings):
“ Get on to the last one, old chap? ”
TOMKINS (sadly): “I did. The brute was beaten
off.”
“ The Crown ” is a mean sort of beast at
times. In N.S.W. there is a law called the Life
Insurance Encouragement Act, which provides
that after a life policy has lasted for a certain
number of years, it isn’t liable to seizure by credi-
tors, but is reserved solely for the benefit of the
husband’s widow and orphans. Now “the
Crown,” in the case of a lunatic who was main*
tained for two years in an asylum before his death,
seeks to grab £6B for board and lodging out of a
miserable £2OO, on the ground that its own law
doesn’t apply to “the Crown.” Perhaps it
doesn’t, but when a chimney sweep can’t recover
liis debt under the same circumstances, “the
Crown” might let the point go. “The Crown”
shouldn’t be meaner than a chimney sweep.

There isn t the same utterly hopeless look about
the fetate Treasuries reports that there was a while back.
they are not what they were, they are still not
what they should be. Barring- Victoria, there isn’t one
state not even Queensland —which is living quite within
its means ; and as tor Victoria its Treasury publishes no
monthly or even quarterly expenditure returns, and only
a guess can be made at what Bent is doing. Bent likes
to spring surprises. Moreover, there can be no honestv
about Australian State Treasurers’ figures until they stop
reckoning in proceeds from the sale of assets as revenue—
and they will have to stop some day when there isn’t any
more land to sell. Meantime, through this political
fraud, N.S.W. revenue ”is puffed up to the extent of a
million a year, Victoria’s by a third of a million, and
Queensland sby about a quarter of a million. Revenue
figures have) therefore, to be discounted to that extent to
get at the truth.

N.S.W. reports a remarkable increase in revenue for the
month ; but it isn’t the sort of increase to do the Treasurer
most good. It is nearly all derived from railways, and
has been accompanied by an increase in expenditure of
almost the same size. For the four months of this year
so-called revenue proper ” has shrunk £15,496, and that
is mostly dead loss ; revenue from business undertakings
has increased £152,409, and that isn’t clear gain, for the
reason just mentioned. (There are small refunds, charged
m -?iAu nera l way ' which Prevent these two totals agreeing
with the net result given above.) But how things stand
in the matter of real revenue can’t be said, because
„' an . c li' even ) l e> which includes land sales, has shrunk
u- u" ’ so 'k nla -7 he that less land is being sold j’ust now,
which may account for the shrinkage. If that is so, there
isn t much to be sorry for. Land sales must of necessity
taper off (unless the Treasury commits another fraud,
and, after buying up estates with borrowed money, collars
the proceeds of the sales as revenue) ; the only 'thino- to
be done is to put something in the place of the “sold
asset. The ic. increase is due mainly to railways and
excise ; that of Queensland nearly all to railways. For
the four months the Queensland lines earned £525 144
as against £460,110 in July-Oct., 1904. Stamp duty is
also helping. Westralia did a trifle better in October,
and pulled down its deplorable deficit an inch or two.
But since the increased revenue is mostly from
services, it isn’t much use considering revenue without
considering also the increased expenditure :

jhi&uvahcr’fieople would reeES.rit a shocking’sur-
re »r- er - they couldn’t express an opinion about
a Minister s conduct except once a year—say, two or
three months after the year was over—yet in this matter
of finance they are prepared to take Irvine’s, or Bent’s
or Jolly Jack Evans’s, or anybody’s word for it for 15
months or so.
This sums up the situation
N.S. Wales.—Deficits (at Oct. 31st): 1902, £707 004 •
1903, £788,934 ; 1904, £783,659 ; 1905, £710,637. Com-
paring 1902 and 1905 (this present year of almost remark-
able prosperity) there is, therefore, mighty little for a
Reform Treasurer to be proud of.
Queensland,—Available for payment of current interest
(Oct. 31st): 1902, £263,122 ; 1903, £270,143; 1904, £548,473-
1905, £568,461. Which is something in the way of a
recovery to feel good about. The interest bill for four
months is £515,000.
Westralia.—Oct. 31, 1902, surplus, £144,312: 1903
deficit, £43,421 ; 1904, deficit, £75,277 ; 1905, deficit’
£34,324. And this State, which won’t pay its way and
has just returned with a thumping majority a Premier
and Treasurer who says he won’t make a serious attempt
to pay his way—this State will this year provide about
£2,000,000 in dividends to foreign people who are rooting
out its gold, and diminishing its resources, and makino- it
harder for the future to pay the bill which is being piled
up. In the whole lamentable history of Australian public
finance, there isn’t a worse case than this.
S. Australia.—Deficit in Sept., ’O4, £49,396; Sept. ’O5
£59,516. Premier Price finds (as the Railway Commis-
sioner has repeatedly reported) that the railways want
more money spent on them—as they get older all railways
will want more spent on them—and these figures are the
consequence.
As to the three-ball department, N.S. Wales
has spent in four months £539,061 of loan money, which
is £187,727 less than last year’s total at Oct. 31st., and is
something to J. H. Carruthers’ credit, though the borrow-
ings are still at the rate of over 1-J millions a year. Queens-
land’s total for the year is £78,170, as against £7B 746.
And the rest don’t tell the size of their offence till the’end
of the year.

When the Commonwealth takes insurance in
hand and regulates it, it ought to call for a stiff license
fee from every foreign office to which any office doin»-
business in Australia passes on any insurance. A foreign
office, coming to Australia, hangs out its shingle ; and
ccJwv lb .takes a £lO,OOO risk, it passes on as niuch as
.taUOU of it to obscure European or American offices with
which the foreign management has fixed up treaties,
iinis Australian risks running into hundreds of thousands
are held by fore.gn concerns that Australia hardly
ever heard of,, and thousands of pounds of good
Australian money goes by way of profits to co.’s
and underwriters who don’t even buy a brass plate
in Australia ; they simply have treaties with other English
and foreign offices having branches and agencies here
The average Australian won’t look at a foreign life assurance
office ; the Australian office is “ good enough for him,” and
it s as good as it is \that is to say, it is as good as any in
the world, and in some respects better), simply because he
has giveh it practically his solid support. If he followed
the same practice.with regard to fire insurance, he would
get the same result's—he would before long get bi«- risks
covered at a price at which the foreign office would be as
utterly unable to compete, as it is now in the matter of
fife assurance. He can get just as good terms already from
the Australian fire and marine offices as he can from any
foreign office ; but he hands over an enormous proportion
of his business to the foreign office, and compels the Aus-
tralian office to hustle hard for business, and keep three
canvassers going where one ought to be enough, and so
he makes low costs impossible. He has been able to get
remarkable bonuses from Australian life offices because of
their low expense rates—he hasn’t given them merely odd
scraps of business and compelled them to hustle for' even
that much—and he has reaped the benefit. And the Aus-
tralian never will reap the same benefit in connection
with his other insurance until he adopts the same practice
with regard to that business.
Though he wouldn’t think of using that argu-
ment in connection with his life assurance, the Australian
° much less a good Australian than the average,
lf a co - gets his fire business it
is just the same as if an Australian office gets it.
, s ! usfc as good for an English office to have
the business as for Australia to have it, it must also
be just as good for England to have people as for
Australia to have them ; so this talk of bringing immi-
grants from England to Australia is absurd and a waste of
breath. But the Australian who thinks that he is sup-
porting simply a British co. doesn’t know ; he reckons
without the foreign treaty offices—the Continental offices
that the British offices pass on their excess risks to.
Australia probably won’t be prepared yet awhile to abso-
lutely bar out the foreign office (though it should be), but,
anyhow, besides collecting a license fee from the offices
which have branches here—and almost every other coun-
try in the world does that—it ought to collect a fee also
from every other office which does treaty business here.
It the obscure French, German, Austrian, Spanish or
Italian office won’t pay, the English office here, which
passes on Australian business to it, should be made to
pay for it as its agent. Meantime, the Australian needn’t
wait for any law on the subj’ect; he can make one for
himself, anyhow, and rule out the foreign co. so far as he
is personally concerned. And he will find it good business
ln -J. , . 1 un > J usfc as it has been found in connection
with his life assurance policies.

Profits shrank still further from the point they reached
two years ago. That point was. however, probably quite
abnormal. Times were wretchedly bad then. Money
was scarce, and high rates were paid for deposits ; and for
every £ per cent, more the bank paid, the bank’s cus-
tomer paid 1 per cent, or over. For some classes of
advances rates were extremely high—yet no higher than
the risk called for. If, instead of a couple of extra-good
seasons, there had been two more bad ones, smashes
would have come wholesale, and the banks, especially
those with a big country connection, direct or indirect
would have been kept busy writing off losses. As it
turned out, extra-good harvests came; and so the risk
the banks took turned out all right. But when we look
at those big profits, we have to remember that they Were
the results of abnormal conditions, and so we needn’t
expect them to continue. Since then, though the reduc-
tion in deposit rate has steadied the fall in profits, the
foreign exchange business isn’t anything like as profitable
as it was, and that partly counterbalances matters. Still

Through the severe reduction of premises account, toge-
ther probably with something hidden behind “ bills in
circulation, &c.,” the bank is building up an informal
reserve, which also to some extent accounts for the size
of its earnings rate. The large increase in liquid assets is
represented by call money in London, where such loans
(£2,693,000 as against £1,333,000 twelve months ago, and
£295,000 two years ago) have lately been earning more
than usual; so profits are temporarily steadied in that
way. All liquid assets constitute 35 p.c. of liabilities to
the public—solid, vet not so large bio- *„ s .

A change has been made in the form of the accounts,
“for the sake,” it is explained, “of clearness.” And they
are now no clearer than mud. If any profits have been
made from the sale of laud they are included in the item
“ interest, rent, &c., £2237.” The only other receipts are
“ commissions and fees, £64.” When interest or rent and
profits were shown separately it was possible to form some
idea of what the assets were realising and what the
unrealised balance ought to be worth. At present it is
possible to do neither. Apart from that, the figures show
up remarkably well. In 1892, when the shutters went up
deposits amounted to £178,369 ; by 1899 they were down
to £56,028 ; and from that point this has happened :
Property
and Cash
Capital Deposits. Advances. Credits.
1899 .. £36,589 £56,028 £94,113 £3828
1900.. 39,759 50,614 93,468 4910

1905 .. 47,291 35,589 94,478 757
The striking thing here is that, while in six years deposits
have been largely reduced, property and advances have
increased. It has been managed in this way :
Capital raised (£4497 now forfeited) .. £10,702
Beduction of cash credits .. .. 3,071
Business and sale profits .. .. 7,027
Total realised .. . . £20,800
Less applied to increase of assets .. 3(ji
Available to pay off deposits .. £20,439
The increased property and advances shown above total
£365 ; but there is a reduction of £4 in a furniture
item. There remain £35,589 of deposits, repayable in 11
years ; and at the past rate of progress, if the co. could
in that time raise £23,500 apart from profits, it would see
the last of the deposits and retain the present amount of
property and (book value). If, however, it has
to realise assets to pay off deposits, things may look very
different. Assuming that “rent, interest, &c.,” is all
rent and interest, it shows only a £2 7s. per cent, return
gross on the average book value of assets ; if these assets
were written down to even a 4 per cent, basis, they would
appear as about £56,000 instead of £94,478. The society
has, however, 11 years in which to pay up (by instal-
ments) ; and it won’t be till two or three years after that
that the accrued interest will have to be paid ; and manv
things will happen in 11 years, and more in 13. Most of
the property is vacant land, chiefly unproductive at
present; and what it will be worth within 13 years
nobody knows. And yet, for this society, everythin'*-
depends upon that. One can quite understand why an
unimproved land tax isn’t popular in some quarters in
Queensland—this isn’t the only concern which is hanging
on, and waiting for somebody else to put up values.
Even if the whole of the assets of the Q.D.
Bank, including the idle lands, were written down to a
4 per cent, basis, there would still remain a surplus of
about £21,000 after paying- depositors their principal and
accrued interest. Since so much of the assets are earning-
nothing, what the concern wants badly is some new busi-
ness to keep the pot boiling, and the foregoing fact
ought to assist it to get what it needs. New deposits are,
moreover, a first charge on all assets ; yet apparently' the
office isn’t rushed with new deposits. It is pretty certain,
nevertheless, that deposits are very often put into leakier
vessels.

The dividend at the rate of 15 p.c. paid in the previous
half-year included a bonus to mark the co.’s 50th birth-
day. The co.’s practice for many years was to pay for
additions to plant, mills, &e., out of profits ; there was no
formal writing off, the replacement and depreciation fund
remaining at £500,000 or thereabouts. No new works
having been undertaken in the half-year ending March
31st last, £16,045 was then formally written off to square
matters. In the past half-year additions have apparently
been made, and the old practice has been reverted to.
Six months ago, in announcing that no new works were
in progress, for the first time in the co.’s history, the
chairman added a little to the Stinking Fish noise which
was just then popular ; things have improved since then,
it seems, and the country isn’t going to the dogs, and it
is still worth while to put out capital in extending Aus
tralian business. It is a pity the chairman didn’t make-
as much mention of this fact as he did of the
other one six months ago. Meantime, since the amount
spent out of profits in new plant, &c., isn’t disclosed, the
true profits on current business can’t be arrived at; but
taking the figures as presented, they show a return of
£8 11s. lOd. per cent, on present capital(£2,2oo,ooo) and
reserves as at March 31. As to the writings-off, in the
past two years, though new works have been almost con-
stantly in progress, refineries, mills, and freeholds,
steamers, &c., have been reduced in book value from
£2,557,572 to £2,474,166, or an apparent writing off of
£83,406 in addition to the cost of the extensions.

And as the share capital has remained stationary .at
£28,588, deducting that amount from the nominal surplus
will give the nominal reserves shown above. In 10 years
therefore, debts amounting to £114,812 have been wiped
out at a cost of £115,156 of assets. As to whether future
realisations can be expected to be as satisfactory, only one
test can be applied. In 1895 the interest, rent &c.
showed £7 2s. 6d. per cent, on assets; for the past year
they showed £7 4s. 9d. per cent. The balance of the
.properties, as written down, are thug -Uirino- a 'rather
better fettfri. tlliui tjie )ot..d’4'iS years ago ; so it seems
that the loss on salfs is just about provided for by profits
on current business. If, therefore, the realisation con-
tinues at the present rate, and the shareholders go with-
out dividends and the depositors accept 3 per cent, to the
end, the capital as written down will at last be returned.
But that is looking a long way ahead, and many things
may happen meantime.

The amount which has disappeared is vaguely referred to
as an “ appropriation it appears to have come off ad-
vances, investments, etc. At the same time, some of the
investments have been written up, and the amount of
this appreciation is lumped with current profits
which isn’t a satisfactory way of dealing with such
dissimilar items. As far as can be made out, certain
works at Young, Dubbo, and North Sydney were written
up £7588 ; then, according to the directors’ statement
current business gave a profit of £7Bl4—total £15,402.’
And as the profit and loss account shows £3983 profit
apparently £11,419 was written off old debts, in addition
to the £2OOO appropriation previously mentioned. These
figures, however, can only be arrived at by piecing the
directors’ report and the accounts together—the accounts
alone don’t give any hint of them. Co.’s capital is
£121,684 ; its liabilities are £111,125; and its assets are
freeholds, plant, etc., £139,000 (the vast pile nearlv
opposite Circular Quay, Sydney, is the chief freehold—
the old idea of turning it into a residential palace seems
“off”), advances and investments £63,728, and stocks
etc., £8905. There is a goodwill item of £24,516- this’
being disregarded in the table, accounts for the deficit
which shows up there.

The capital was formerly £40,000 ; bu t in the struggle to
establish the industry, £30,000 of this was lost, and had
to be written off, and after that another £20,000 had to
be raised. The present div. is really, therefore 5 per
cent, per annum on the total capital put into
the business, and, on that capital and the reserves
which were accumulated during the period of
moderate Protection under the Victorian State tariff the
past half-year’s profit shows a wretched return at the’rate
of £3 11s. 9d. per cent, per annum. And vet this is the
business which the Tariff Commission was told in Victoria
was flourishing, and paid excessive dividends even with
the reduced tariff. Not only are the profits disappearing
but in the struggle to keep the business the co. is driftin'’-
into debt; it keeps going in the hope that Australia will
laise the tariff and save this and other large wag-e-supply-
ing businesses, but, as it can’t g'et in more capital while
profits are slumping', it has to borrow on mortg-affe. At
5, Ild of , lB99ifc owed the public (including overdrafts)
£3147, and against that had £3OOO on fixed deposit ; now
it owes £17,903 and has nothing on deposit. The’point
must be reached, if this movement continues, at which the
bank will say that it is tired, and that the co. must rush
in and realise, even if it only realises enough to pay its
debts to the public ; something very like that has hap-
pened during the last few months in connection with at
least two Australian woollen mills. Nothing could be
clearer than that the present tariff is not sufficient—that
it is not only not sufficient to encourage new mills to
start, but is choking even those that had got a start; and
it most seriously threatens to turn much valuable ma-
chinery into scrap iron, and throw idle the whole of the
work people.

The movement of the profits of this co. is perplexing. If
a trustee co. only took credit for current commission and
a fair percentage of the corpus commission, its returns
should be fairly uniform ; the irregularity here suggests
that the co. credits itself with the whole corpus commission
as the estates come in, leaving the current commission to
pay all expenses, and it is often inadequate for that
purpose. Under this system a half-year’s declared profits
are absolutely no criterion as to future profits. This co.
lumps commission and interest, and the return from
investments is not revealed ; no test as to the real value
of the investments can therefore be applied. In addition
to its capital (£10,000) and reserves, the co. has £12,313 of
borrowed money (lumped as “ amounts owing by the
association ”) to work on ; assets consist of £5OOO with
the Tas. Treasurer, £8537 on mortgage, and £11,056
vaguely described as “ amounts owing to association,”
and the balance cash. The half-year’s profits show a
handsome £l6 11s. 2d. per cent, per annum on share-
holders’ funds ; but, as mentioned just now, little weight
can be attached to that.

The profits are net, after providing for depreciation.
How much has been written off is not clear. Ship
property is in at £39,475, or £7OO less than on March 31st;
but the writing-down was probably more that that,
because the directors state that the Shellharbor Co.’s
steamer Peterborough was acquired during the half-year.
In addition £5OO was added to Repairs, Suspense, and
Contingency account, making it £2500 ; this also looks
partly a reserve, though not included in the reserves
shown above. The financial position is very strong; besides
ship property the co. has £43,949 in Treasury bills and
bank balances; but further additions are being made to the
fleet and business, which will presumably absorb some of
this. Cfn the present capital (£74,695) and reserves as at
March 31st the whole year's net profit gave £6 15s. lOd.
per cent. But pretty well everything depends upon the
extent of the writings-down. If they have been just
enough, the figures given above correctly express the
situation ; if they have been more than reasonably
liberal, something in the way of a hidden reserve is being
created, and the real profits are better than these figures.
It is a case in which one has to trust the directors and
the management for a lot.

This energetic co. (even Tasmania has some energy) has
been providing itself with new premises, and as it builds
it writes down the value. Twelve months ago it was
stated that £2OOO was being transferred from the del
credere , or contingent liability, account; but this isn’t
shown anywhere in the accounts —apparently it
has been written off premises, too. Presuming that
the premises are worth the money spent upon them,
and that they didn’t displace old premises rendered
valueless (which doesn’t seem to be the case,
because in 1902 there wasn’t a premises asset at
all), these emphatic writings-down represent so much
hidden reserve—temporarily, anyhow, till the buildings
decay. Another £lOOO has been transferred now to
premises account, and presumably that also w'ill disappear
next year. One result of wiping out reserves in this wav
is to inflate the return on shareholders’ funds as set out
in the accounts ; for the year the profit shows £l2 13s. 9d.
per cent. But it is better to err on this side, anyhow,
than to load up a balance-sheet with paper items and
over-valued assets. The co.’s debts to the public total
£14,178 ; on the other side, advances, &c., total £18,359.
The other assets consist of premises and freehold, £ll 763 •

The electric light part of the undertaking, according to
the accounts, shows the usual loss—this time £5OO. This
is arrived at by charging* £1165, or 63 per cent, of gross
income, for “ interest, depreciation, and wear and tear,”
and yet no loan is disclosed in the accounts for interest
to be paid upon. There is an item, “interest, £399,”
among the general receipts ; apparently the electric light
business is charged 5 per cent, on capital outlay (at pre-
sent £16,000); and if that is so, then there isn’t a “loss”
of £5OO on the electric light business—there is only
that loss after paying the co. its dividend of 5 per cent, on
the capital put into that part of the business and after
U'riting-down plant at the rate of nearly 10 per cent, per
annum. It looks as thoug-h this co. quite recognises that
its business is to make gas, and incidentally to show'
others that it won’t pay to produce electric light in com-
petition. To the gas undertaking £1584, which is rather
less than usual, is charged for renewals and mainten-
ance ; but nothing is written off otherwise—it seems to
be assumed that a patched-up gas plant is as good as new.
The co. has a capital of £99,000, and nothing in the shape
of debentures, overdraft or similar debt.

The N.S.W. Government had for many years
been running its exchange business under an agreement
with the banks, paying 2s. per cent, on the daily gross
total of its country cheques. The bulk of this exchange
business was in connection with the Land-tax. Country
remitters were allowed to make payments for the tax with
cheques drawn on their local banks, and no exchange was
charged. Premier Carruthers decided to change that.
So he sent a flaming red circular to the man in the coun-
try demanding exchange at full local rates on all future
payments. Then the man in the country took the circu-
lar to his local banker, and he sent it on to head office,
and head office wrote to the Premier that although,
under the old agreement, the bank would collect
Government cheques at 2s. per cent, on the daily total,
nevertheless, it would not collect for the public at the
same rates ; and that the Premier, in demanding pay-
ment of exchange from the public, had taken these
cheques outside the agreement. Now that Premier is

Electric haulage is one of the best paying in-
vestments for every mine in which the wash-dirt has to be
hauled from a greater distance than 2000 feet. The actual
saving effected at the Berry Consols Extended Mine,
Allendale, amounts to £30 per week at a distance of 3000
feet; at the Great Southern Consols Mine, Rutherglen, it
runs into £45 per week, at a distance of 5000 feet ; in both
instances the necessary plant which was installed to
replace the manual labor has cost but £1200. Experience
has proved that at a distance of 4000 feet electric haulage
cost a quarter of that of horse traction and a tenth of hand
trucking. The Charlotte Plains and New Havillah Mines
at Moolort are the latest to adopt electric haulage, and
have again proved it to be highly satisfactory. The favor-
able results obtained with these installations are un-
doubtedly due in a great measure to the reliable and
smooth operation of the electric apparatus, especially the
locomotives adopted, which were all supplied and erected
by the Austral Otis Engineering Company, Limited, corner
of Hanna and Kavanagh-streets, South Melbourne, agents
for Ganz and Company, Budapest, Hungary. This firm has
devoted special attention to mine haulage problems, and
during their 14 years’ experience have brought up their
mine locomotives and other haulage apparatus to the
highest degree of perfection.* [2.]

The British Broken Hill Silver Mining Co.,
after careful consideration of all types of boilers, have
placed an order with Babcock and Wilcox for three large
boilers, each of 500 h.p. Superheaters, chain grate
mechanical stokers and economiser have also been
ordered from the same firm. This now makes 40 boilers
of the Babcock and Wilcox type supplied to the various
mines and industries at Broken Hill. Wherever economy
in fuel and maintenance of boiler has to be seriously con-
sidered by competent engineers, the Babcock boiler is
installed. Hence the recent unanimous decision of the
Expert Admiralty Committee to install Babcock boilers as
the standard for the British Navy.*

Some months ago, at Charters Towers, the drill
in Day Dawn Gold Mine lease located 4ft. of white stone,
supposed to be the Talisman reef that is being worked on
the eastern side by the Block- and Wyndham. The event
must have escaped the directors’ memory, for it was not
reported until there was nothing of the core left, and so
shares came down to Is. After six mpnths of calls shares
are now wanted at between 4s. and 5s., but there is no
known improvement to warrant the rise. No. 10 going
west is out 579ft., all on 4ft. of diorite formation. This is
the deepest level and will do valuable prospecting work,
as the show is west of all other mines. Half-yearly, report
shows that the only stone broken was by tributors, 308
tons, from which the co. received £231 in royalty. After
seven or eight months’ consideration, a shaft from No. 8
level has been started to shed a little light oh this 4ft. of
mysterious white stone.

Melbourne Board of Works, which consists of
E. G. Fitzgibbon and representatives of 24 municipalities,
has a row on with the municipalities it represents, the
board’s powers of taxation were fixed in IS9O when all
property had an inflated value. The bursting of the boom
dropped these values 40 per cent, and narrowed the
board’s resources. Fitzgibbon is an earnest apostle
of the doctrine of borrow, and for years has been
stopping up the annual deficit with loan money. The
Board’s powers of taxation are being exercised to
the full, and yet every year bring’S more deficit.
This year it is to be £51,000; and the Board wants to
raise rates all round on both sewered and unsewered pro-
perty ; also to increase the water rate, and so make the
water system, which is paying, carry some of the burden
of the sewerage system, which isn’t. A conference of 23
of the municipalities reviewed the Board’s finan-
cial position a few weeks ago, and, as the result
of its findings and recommendation, the Board
and the municipalities have come to a deadlock.
The conference, which represents Proputty, does not
want to pay the increased rates ; on the other hand it
doesn’t want to g-o on piling up deficits that will some
day have to be made good. In short, it doesn’t want to
pay and it doesn’t want to owe. It wants the board to
limit its new expenditure to £200,000 a year (the board
says that £1,000,000 altogether is wanted), and to spend
this £200,000 only on work that will return 3} per cent.,
and it asks that no part of the loss on sewerage be loaded
on to the water supply. A scheme for wiping off the
accumulated deficit of over half-a-million was not formu-
lated, mostly because Fitzgibbon exploded at this
stage. The conference, however, has appealed to the
Government, and Bent is going to take a hand, and,
as an expert in deficits, guesses he’ll fix things up in
about an hour and a-half. As far as can be seen, a rate of
4d. in the £ will have to be struck on the outside, un-
sewered portion of the area to make the accounts come out
square, and a rate of sd. would enable the whole scheme
to be finished off. But the municipalities want some
guarantee that this sort of thing will not go on ad
infinitum. Three times now they have been told exactly
how much they would have to pay, and every time it has
been half-a-million or so more than the previous time.

There seems to be a chance at last of the Stock
Exchanges of Sydney and Melbourne letting’ the public
know that they are nimble-ninepenny concerns, and
not great national “ institutions.” Metropolitan Board
of Works is about to convert its 4J per cent, loan, and it
does not propose to pay brokerage for the conversion,
seeing that stiff corns, have already been paid on
original issue. As there are a host of other con-
versions ahead, Sydney brokers are credited with wanting
to make an example of this Fitzgibbon 4.) conversion,
so as to ensure a com. in the case of future similar trans-
actions ; and Melbourne Exchange to all appearances is
following in the wake of the Sydney crowd. There have
been whispers that, if the Board doesn’t back down, the con-
version loan may not be quoted. Rumor of this kind is hard
to nail to the counter, but that there is a rare hullabaloo
:s shown by the interviews between the finance committee
of the Board of Works and the Stock Exchange deputies.
If the Board puts its back up, there isn’t much fear of the
Stock Exchanges provoking public resentment by a direct
refusal to list the stock. If it went to that leng’th another
reason would be provided for the Legislatures of N.S.W.
and Victoria putting brokers under control.
Since the new co. took charge, this is how
things have turned out at the Broken Hill North :

Costs include development, about £750 per four weeks.
There are 130,000 shares in the co. ; profits on the 16
weeks’ basis are at the rate of £29,300 per half-year, oi-
ls. 6d. per share. But it is now possible to increase the
mill tonnage, and by the end of this year the output
should reach 2000 tons a week.
* * * *
The progress which B.H. North is making in
the matter of profit per ton of ore isn’t very cheerful
when it is remembered that in its first four weeks lead
was reckoned by the new co. at £l3 10s., and silver at
2s. 5d., and that the prices have gone up steadily until in
the last four weeks they averaged £l4 2s. 4d. for lead and
2s. 6id. for silver. Nobody knows where the lead market
is going, and how long it will stay there ; it is almost
pure gamble. But here is a fact, or two. The Barrier
silver-field started on a rising market 21 years ago, and
that time lead went up to £l5 10s. (1888), Then the
usual slump started, and the pripe went back to
£9 (1894). After that the see-saw took it steadily
up to £l7 17s. 6d. (1900); and the slump took it
back to £lO 2s. 6d. in 1902, which was much more
sudden than usual. Present price is £l4 17s. 6d. In
the Barrier’s 21 years lead has in two years gone above
£l7, in three above £l6, in four above' £l5, and in ten
above £l4. But there is such an erratic market that,
though in nearly half the years it has at some point of the
12 months passed £l4, only in two years out of the 21 has
it failed during some other part of the twelve-months to
get down below £l3. There are yarns now about a steady
market at £l6 or so. Well, to these yarns foregoing
figures simply say “ Rats ! ” Now the North’s lead out-
put for past 16 weeks has been 3699 tons, or at the rate of
6010 tons per half-year ; and from that it can be seen what
a movement £1 a ton either way means to the North.
**" * *
B.H. Block 14 is already able to pay its pref.
shareholders a dividend. This is the first since the begin-
ning of 1901. A report was printed in London six weeks
ago that the mill was “ doing work equal to the best on
the field.” As a matter of fact, it is doing absolutely- the
worst, getting out only 55 p.c. of the lead and 35 p.c. of
the silver, against the North’s 72 p.c. of the lead and
51 p.c. of the silver. Of course, an effort is being made
to improve this ; but, so far, though mine developments
have been good, mill results have been most disappointing.
Some of the Broken Hiil co.’s have stipulated
with the Zinc Corporation that, after the latter has done
with the zinc “ tailings,” the tailings shall be available for
sending underground to re fill worked-out places. But,
considering the size of the deals, it’s marvellous how little
information shareholders have been content with.
* * *
“ Blende ” : H. C. Hoover, of Bewick-Moreing’s
staff, doesn’t deserve quite so much credit over the Zinc
Corporation deals. The organisation was commenced by
H. J. Daley on Lionel Robinson’s behalf. Hoover came
in later, as the idea grew ; he was put up after the first
deal as a good fighter, and did his work well. As to the
control, Bewick-Moreing’s crowd have 30 per cent. ; the
balance of 70 per cent, is in the hands of Lionel Robin-
son and his associates, viz., Daley, Baillieu and Terrell.
* * * *
The C.S. A. development, Cobar, has commenced
to brush the cobwebs accumulated in years of apathy off
the Sydney mine-speculating crowd, and they now begin to
take notice. Flotation of Hardie’s Central Blocks (which,
by the way, Hardie passed on to the brokers) was the first
pronounced success, and encourages others to try the
same market. All Sydney has been told by now what a
good thing the Central Blocks are. As a matter of fact,
both the Central and C.S. A. South join Andrews’; latter
is now known as “ Perseverance Frank Gardner’s ” ; but
the compass isn’t yet made that will tell whether C.S.A.
lode goes through Hardie’s Central or the South. South
has the advantage of a surface outcrop and nice indica-
tions at 50ft., and that isn’t exactly encouraging for the
Central. Still, there’s nothing lost through having a
neighborly connection with a speculator like Frank
Gardner ; and as the Central has its pegs not too far from
Gardner’s, anything may happen.
» * * *
Since the flotation of C.S.A. Central Blocks,
Cobar, the Gt. Peak S.M. Co. has launched itself quite
comfortably on an apparently legitimate basis. Follow-
ing Peak’s float, Premier gets on to the market in a
48,000 share co., no liability ; 24,000 shares are offered at
6d. application, 6d. allotment, and Id. per month. The
Premier will float, just like a good many other shows will ;
but, for the moment, none besides Gt. Peak and Premier
in that neighborhood seems worthy of much attention.
Both these are good prospecting shows, and well-situated ;
the Peak itself is, at time of writing, getting first-rate
values.
* * * *
South C.S.A., Cobar, which is now held in 68
shares, is likely to get into a decent co. ; while North
C.S.A. (Trewenaclc and Doyle’s block), which undoubtedly
has chances, will shortly solve the mystery with strong
capital.

Boppy Mountain (N.S.W.), of which 360 acres
have now been pegged, has improved the local syndicate’s
prospects with fair assays for gold, silver, and lead. On
Trewenack and Hardie’s block, galena has been found on
the surface, in a huge quartz-reef. G. H. Blakemore, who
is likely to be able to tell an encouraging tale, visits Mt.
Boppy during the week, and more will be said later on as
to his opinion of the property.

Bendigo’s 1905 gold yield is going to be below

shows 174,6620 z., whereas the corresponding 10 months of
1904 saw 206,9370 z., and of 1903 188,3620 z. Share-
market tells the- cause of the decline. South New
Moon and New Moon have got down to the average
dirt predicted months ago, and revived Catherine
Beef United fails to make up the shortage.
Virginia, too, isn’t on a level with the Great Northern—■
indeed, the mine is a disappointment which anywhere,
except in Bendigo, would demand and get vigorous inves-
tigation. Further, Specimen Hill hasn’t picked up, and
New Hopeful somehow doesn’t gee on to the shoot of
gold. All the same, the district is doing well, perhaps
better than any other field in Australia, for the newer
mines look like helping it to a new life, and old mines,
like the Catherine Reef United and the New T Chum Rail-
way, are rejuvenating some of their decrepit neighbors.
Long may it be so, for there is no field in Australia where
the real investor gets a more genuine run for his money.
That is because it’s an Australian field, backed by Aus-
tralian capital, with a closed door to Yankee boom
managers and London sharks.

The Mining Commission, sitting in Melbourne,
to deal with the complaints of the coal miners against
the Victorian coal companies, wants to probe closely and
deeply. The point that needs determining is, if it is true,
as stated by M‘Nair, that men could not get work unless
they bomrht land from certain people. The matter should
be easy of elucidation. Call the miners holding cottages,
find from whom they bought, trace if there had been
any previous trafficking in the properties, discover
above all the course of ownership, and lastly learn how
ownership was affected by strikes. These points investi-
gated, it would soon be proved or disproved whether
properties have been constantly sold and re-sold after
reverting to original owners. If M‘Nair is wrong, he
ought to be pilloried ; if he is rig’ht, then any system of
rack-renting ought to be instantly ended and a full dis-
closure made of the names of those concerned. So far
only the one side has been heard, but enough has been
stated to show the need for the Commission and the need
for the commissioners making their investigation search-
ing. The railway subsidy makes coal mining in Victoria
partially a State concern ; so there can be no defence
against publication.

Great Southern, Bendigo, has exposed a forma-
tion at 2210 ft. Stone so far carries no gold, but the fact
that a west leg has been disclosed may mean a change
for the better in another of the “ has-beens ” of the field.
What has to be done is to rise above the slide met when
driving the crosscut. Speculation now centres in whether
the formation beyond the slide will make larger and carry
the precious metal. Co. is also putting out a 2110 ft.
crosscut which is getting near centre country. So what
with waiting to see what is likely to turn up here, and
what the extension to the 2210 ft. crosscut to the east
back will disclose, shareholders are having plenty of fun
for their money.

Many dead and partially buried Vic. goldfields
are hearing the trump of the dredge-promoter and are
hurrying up to the resurrection. This rush after hitherto
unconsidered trifles has also started some sort of a boom
in other processes of re-treatment. Near Heatbco'te
(Vic.), on the old and once rich MTvor goldfields, several
plants are at work. One dredge is working the bed of the
MTvor Greek ; a 12oz. nugget came up with the fine stuff
recently. Many big nuggets were found in this creek
bed, but the diggers’ claims stopped at a bar of cement,
below which is wash dirt never yet touched. Several
other dredges are to go into these grounds. At Coster-
field the tailings from the antimony mines are being
roasted to get rid of every metal that isn’t gold ; the
remaining clean sand is then cyanided. Redcastle has
two cyanide plants, another plant for concentrating
the minerals in the old tailings, and shaking tables for
recovering by amalgamation any free gold. When the
price of .cyanide drops to 3d. per lb„ many old sand heaps
will be put through. Bendigo has mountainous heaps,
from which the gold, most of it coarse, has been pretty
thoroughly extracted by the batteries, yet they will pay to
put through when the method of handling them is still
further cheapened.

October divs. of W.A. mines totalled £237,562,
against £183,750 for October last year. Co.’s responsible
are Great Fingall £lOO,OOO, Ivanhoe £50,000, Perseverance
£35,000,. Sons of Gwalia £24,375, Kalgurli £15,000,
Hainault £6787, Ida H. £5400, Cumberland £lOOO. Com-
pared with first 10 months of last year, figures read
£1,970,938 against £1,743,682, an increase of £227,256.
The whole of last year only produced £2,073,047, so that
total will be easily topped.
* * * *
Perseverance, Kalgoorlie, is in future to publish
costs, and also report developments simultaneously in
Kalgoorlie and London. During last year costs worked
out at 435. 9d. per short ton, and are now officially stated
to be between 225. and 235. If there is no hole anywhere
in these figures, manager Klug has done marvellously well.
Monthly’ output last year was about 12,700 tons, and this
year the average has been about 14,000 tons ; so increased
tonnage certainly cannot account for such an enormous
reduction in costs. Still further cost-saving alterations
in treatment plant are contemplated. Prospecting is now
being done to locate the 20ft. lode worth 2oz. found by
the west crosscut at the 1200 ft. level from the Associated.
The 1200 ft. level of the Associated corresponds with about
1130 ft. on the Perseverance ; and crosscuts are now going
out both at 1100 ft. and 1300 ft. to see if the lode can be
located. The chance of this rich lode being found soon
makes Perseverance a very good gamble.
*** * *
Westralia Mt. Morgans is picking up. It is
officially’ stated to have reduced costs from 345. per short
ton last year to 21s. now; on this basis the profit for
August works out at £2lOO, and for September at £l3OO,
and this, too, with only 40 head of stamps running 15
day’s as against 60 head running 30 day’s. The duty per
stamp per day has been increased from 4’5 to 10’3 short
tons—the highest in Australia. Good finds have recently
been made in the oxidised zone both in the north and
south ends of property, and ore reserves have been
increased 50 per cent. But even then the ore avail-
able is only about 50,000 tons, and wouldn’t keep the mill
going three months at full pressure. A. E. Morgans still
expresses himself as confident of putting the mine on its
legs again, but he has a hard row to hoe.
* * * *
Golden Pole, Davyhurst (W.A.), has very few
backers. Continued drop in grade of ore treated is
making investors sceptical of official figures of reserves.
When ore becomes 40s. per ton poorer in six months, it is
enough to make the public suspicious. Instead of ore
being worth 20z., as once stated officially’, it pans out as
not worth loz. The shoot at 400 ft. is now being followed
north on the dip by an incline winze, and the surface
workings on the south shoot will shortly be connected
with the south drive from 130 ft. level. The reef is look-
ing all right in the bottom, and that is the best thing
that can be said of the mine.
* * * «
Ivanhoe Junction, Kalgoorlie, after vainly offer-
ing the management to Oiviall Hawkins and a well-
known Kalgoorlie engineer at £325 per an., has appointed
an Adelaide man at £6 per week. Mine is hopeless, but
it the new man is a boomster, scrip may yet be a good
gambling counter. In spite of all the prospecting done
in four levels down to 340 ft., no pay shoot has been dis-
covered, and results of test crushings, alleged to be worth
lOdwt., panned out at less than 3dwt. The adjoining
Kalgurli Consols Co. has given the job best, and sold off
all the plant.
* * * *
North End G.M., Kalgoorlie, which owns the
Euclid and Rising Sun, has now got its 15-head mill
erected, and the trial run proved satisfactory. Crushing
will not, however, start till the cyanide plant is installed, a
month or so hence. One of the original holders is reported
to have passed on his 50,000 shares to Winch, of Adelaide,
at 2s. (id. apiece. Unless the style of management is
altered, Winch will certainly be left with the baby to
nurse. Mine has proved pretty remunerative for the
prospectors, but practically no ore is opened up, and, for
economy’s sake, underground work has been stopped till
treatment starts. How a 15-head mill, capable of treat-
ing 1000 tons a month, is to be kept going without any
reserves remains to be seen. Co. is in 200,000 shares of
ss. fully paid, and the total working capital at the start
was only £7500, of which half must now be gone. Many
shares will be marketed ; and, even though it is possible
mine may prove a success, stock looks like one over which
the public may drop in.
* * * *
Great Ophir, Davyhurst (W.A.), is officially said
to have been successfully reconstructed ; also stated that
the 100,000 cons., on which Is. was payable on application
and Is. on allotment, leaving 3s. have been ab-
sorbed. New equipment plant will have a capacity of
5,000 tons monthly, and there is said to be enough ore
developed to warrant this. Promoters of concern are same
as : North End, and are well backed in Adelaide; but,
except as a pure gamble, scrip cannot be recommended.
It may be all right, but, if so, it is marvellous how mine has
so long hidden its light under a bushel; also it is strange
that its first essay should have ended in a fiasco after one
crushing, so that the co. had to be dry^-docked for repairs.
* * * *
Queensland Menzies (W.A.), after some hesita-
tion, has acquired an option over the Goodenough. This
was under option to boulder No. 1 some time ago, but
was rejected. Prospectors have won a lot of gold, but,
like all Menzies mines, gold shoot is short and hard to
locate, and it hardly seems suitable for a highly capital-
ised co. Nevertheless it may give shareholders a fresh
run for their money. Manager Fergusson knows the
district so well that he should be able to make the most
of what there is there.
* * * *
Pilbarra (W. A.) is keeping its end up ; most of
the shows consistently crush 2oz. Galtee More, Nulla-
gine, has paid its working owners remarkably well. Last
crushing, 260 tons, gave 5380 z. This abd other mines, all
worked by their owners, keep the 10-head State battery
going, scarcity of firewood and water causing the only
stoppages. Considerable tin is being obtained round
Marble Bar; September output is officially given as
50 tons, but many parcels are sent away unrecorded. In
anticipation of the railway being pushed on, prospecting
parties are going through the country, which is about as
big as Victoria, and scarcely explored. Tenders for the
construction of the railway from Port Hedland to Marble
Bar, and on to Nullagine(l7B miles), close on November 30,
but offers are not rolling in, notwithstanding the Govern-
ment guarantee of 3 per cent, on actual outlay and half
of the profits.
* * * *
From one of Australia’s oldest explorers and
prospectors:—“Burtville (VV.A.) is a wonder, and will
pay to watch. Bell and Kerridge, of the Golden Bell,
the other week put through 350 tons, which five men
raised in 10 weeks, for 4oz. 16dwt. per ton, and there is
18dwt. in the tailings. The Karridale has just put
through 150 tons, three men’s work for nine weeks, for
7oz. 3dwt. per ton, and there is 19dwt. in the tailings.
Round about there must be nearly 1000 people, yet they
have no public post or telegraph office. Laverton railway
station is only 17 miles away, and still these people only
get a tri-weekly mail.”
* * * *
Queen Cross, Charters Towers (Q.), has put its
shutters up, as far as production is concerned, until the
battery is set in order, and that may take nearly three
months. Why the co. did not give its stone to a public
mill rather than close down on 150 men is not explained.
Costs of crushing would have been about the same—the
Cross mill was a costly affair from the start. A few men
are still employed doing prospecting work, and advantage
has been taken of the stoppage to sink the straight shaft
with an eye to speed. The diamond drill from the No. 2
level to 2519 ft. vertical from surface, cut eight leaders,
some showing mineral. But nothing important need be
expected until the Band of Hope formation, some 500 ft.
further down, is reached.
* x * «
“We keep no information back,” said the crowd
who run Carrington’s P.C. at Charters Towers. “ There
is enough stone in sight to keep the mill going for 12
months.” Thus the directors at the christening of the
battery, the other day. The swelled heads had hardly
been subdued when news came that the mill was hung up
for want of water, after running for 80 hours, treating
poor stuff. Directors vouch that the mill will commence
again for certain when it rains. Meanwhile scrip has
touched bedrock. But it can’t be trusted even at that
price.
• * * *
Output from Mills United, Charters Towers, for
past half year has increased in tonnage and values. Very
little stoping has been done. Development work runs to
1736 ft., from which 7,331 tons of stone were won and
crushed for an average of £3 15s. per ton. Previous term
saw 5151 tons that averaged £2 55., from 925 ft. of develop-
ment work. No. 6 level is in 643 ft., and another 50ft. is
expected to locate the stone, but it is known to be low
grade. The next thing this level will find after that will
be the School Reserve boundary. No. 7 east for a distance
of 324 ft. will average 3ft. of mineral stone ; in the end
the quality is not so good ; and sft. of stone is showing
in the end of No. 8. No. 10 has 3ft. of payable stone ; no
values are given. Report says that from No. 6 to No. 10
is 500 ft. on the grade, and that No.’s 7 and 8 levels have
followed payable stone to the east for 400 ft. Estimated
that there is an area of about nine acres above No. 10, on
the eastern side of the dyke, to work. Co. commenced
the term with £9,633 in hand, at the close it had £15,078
(of which £6,000 is on deposit), and during the six months
spent £6,880 on machinery and maintenance.
* * * *
Brilliant Extended is likely to be top dog
shortly among the Towers mines. For the month the
battery treated 3000 tons for gold and concentrates worth
£7474, and cyanide saved £9BO worth of bullion from 2200
tons of residues. Total for the month’s run was £8454,
equal to £2 16s. a ton. Mine is opening out well, and is
good property. No. 3 underlie is down 494 ft. and shows in
the sink 9in. on the hanging wall and Ift. of mineral stone
on the footwall. This is encouraging, as it is the first
stone met for some considerable distance. Another 35ft.
of sinking and the No. 13 level will be formed. No. 12
east is in 198ft.' and shows 7ft. of stone ; No. 12 west
shows 3ft. of mineral stone and is in 169 ft. ; and there is
no reason why No. 13 should not get the same bodies of
ore.
* * * *
Smith’s Creek, the mostly Adelaide-owned
N.Q. tin show, has raised the money Captain Warren
reports is necessary to give the doubtful thing a chance,
by pushing off the unissued shares at 45., issuing them
then as paid to 165., and giving the co. about £4OOO to
play with forthwith. But the new shares are preference,
and have first call on assets in the event of liquidation—
which is calculated to give ordinaries a lot of comfort.
* * * *
Latest N.Q. tin rush is around Emuford; claims
and leases are pegged all ways. Two crushings from the
Just in Time went 17 per cent, and 10 per cent. A battery
is coming. Dalziel’s set the tin-scratching going in this
district, and it is having as thorough a prospecting as its
roughness will allow.
• * • *
Two experts “from the United States” have
given Cloncurry (N.Q.) a certificate that it is about the
biggest thing on airth, and only wants a railway—nearly
everything enormous in Queensland “ only wants a rail-
way.” If the field turns out the good thing it possibly
will, railway-contractor G. O. Wilcocks will be the
biggest winner. He pushed off his Cloncurry Exploration
Syndicate of 1200 shares, £25 each, keeping 400 for him-
self, offering the public 400, and holding 400 in reserve.
Then the Government put in £2500, just for the good of
the country (but why didn’t it insist on get-
ting 100 fully-paid shares, “just for the good
of the country,” too ?); and the public has paid up £3200.
These two amounts look as though they were going to
turn Wilcocks’ 400 paid shares into property of very con-
Biddable value. Another of Wilcpcks’ ventures is the
Ulassford Creek ; shares in this sprang lately from £12
10s. to £.>0, and it is talked of already as one of Queens-
land s biggest thing's. But the country doesn’t seem very
promising for ore bodies to live in ; and present methods
of working can hardly show a profit.

A scalp yarn :
“The minin’ might be right enough,” said the store-
keeper, dubiously. “But I ain’t takin’ none. There’s
nothin’ in monkeyin’ with things you don’t understand
I got bit pretty bad when I first come here. Had a
nice little business down below, over Balmain way but
the ’9O strike settled that, so I left an’ started hawkin’.
I’d heard them talkin’ about sellin’ scalps, an’ I thought
by swoppin’ tobacco an’ pipes an’ things for scalps
I d make a bit both ways, but somehow the fellows
didn’t cotton to the idea, not for a week or so. Then
they rushed me. At the end of the month I must have
had thousands of ’em, an’ horses was beginnin’ to shy
at me cart. It smelt like a cross between a Chow’s
garden an’ a glue-factory, so I carted them into town
an’ left them at the Stock Board Office, for the inspec-
tor to pass ’em. I reckoned I’d get a new turn-out
with me cheque, an’ was over at Oakey Creek lookin’
at some horses when I got a letter from the inspector.
He must ’a’ been sober when he wrote, because usually
what you could read of his letters was real ‘jammy.’
‘Dear sir,—You must be a d fool or an '
amateur swindler, or both, but of the bales of
scalps that pollute my premises I have sorted
six on which there is any bonus. I don’t pay
for cat, rabbit, bandicoot, and opossum scalps
not if I know it j and you will oblige me by send-
ln£> by return post, your cheque for 45., which
with the shilling to your credit, will defray ex-
pense of removal and destruction of same.
Your obedient servant, Blank Dash.’
“Y’ see, they only paid for hare scalps, an’ I’d been
buyin anythin’ with ears on. They told me if I had only
seen the auctioneer, who was a pal of the inspector’s he’d
'a’ squared matters, but I didn’t see him. I didn’t’want
to see him. He dealt in scalps. Then I started this
shanty, and, as you’re a stranger, I don’t mind tellin’ you
that, one way an’ another, I’ve got most of that scalp
money back. You don’t run a corner grocery in Sydney
without pickin’ up a feiv points.”

On top of the expressed opinion of
Henry Deane, late N.S.W. Chief Engineer for
Kailway Construction, “ that it is inexpedient to
build up an export hardwood trade which by
using up our assets may in a few years land us in
a poverty-stricken condition,” comes interesting
news from Maoriland. .In a report recently laid
before the House, the forests of Maoriland are
estimated to last, at the outside, 70 years, if the
export trade keeps up and tree-planting is still
neglected. Yet, although a stiff land-tax would
provide sufficient land for five times our present
population without necessitating the wanton des-
truction of any valuable timber, the papers nowa-
days are full of the wails of misguided characters
clamoring for our forest reserves to be handed
over to the axe and the firestick.

“ Octopus ” : Talking about novel methods
of recovering goods that have fallen overboard I
reckon something I saw the other day beats the
band. >Vhile a river boat was at the Hawkesbury
some of the fuel was dropped into the river
between the steamer and the wharf. The ten-
year-old son of a local fisherman witnessed the
accident, and thought he might rescue the coal for
domestic use, so he bagged an octopus from the
morning s catch, and, securing this member of the
cepkalopada family round the middle, he lowered
it to the bottom of the river. There it imme-
diately clung to a piece of coal, whereupon it was
hauled up. This process was continued till the
greater part of the coal had been rescued, when
the diver went on strike.

to the wind, and inside the tin some stones rattled
and banged. The mill turned, carrying the tin
with it, and the noise was fiendish. Another a

Camooweal (Q.), which is out where the dead

drought-country census the other day, and rec-
koned up that it had 2000 gallons of water left in

being made to the public to limit their thirst, and
they were calculating how many drops per day

all ma’s traits are visible in the young one, “ even

“ A. Borig ” : Bill Jim, the country lout,
in Sydney, has been the source of endless amuse-
ment, but unless he is the known father of an ass
he knows enough to come in and have a wet,
as well as keep out of it. It is time Johnny
up the country from Sydney had a turn, and
the Lord knows he is worthy of it. He gets
on my nerves, and incites me to murder and
savagery. Took one for a drive the other day,
up a mountain. Had a very touchy pony, and
could hardly get the harness on her, but no
place would do Johnny but about three feet
from her tail, straight behind, and, do what
I might, he would gravitate back there. Up
the mountain, I put the billy on a bush-
man’s fire, and though his nibs never thought
of helping me take pony out of sulky,
but frightened seven years’ growth out of
her by rushing round in front with rugs, coats,
umbrellas, billy, and Heaven knows what,
still he carried and put enough wood on my
fire to roast a bullock, and I rescued the
billy with difficulty on a sapling. I prayed
for his sudden and painful death at last, and
when he got lost in half an acre of bush, and
stood on a rock whistling for me, I nearly
wept. But my cup was not yet full, for
although we drove down a mountain four
miles long, and the pony breeched for all she
was worth the whole way, he noticed nothing
till we got to the bottom, when, going down
a short pinch, he suddenly spied the breech-
ing, and the pony sitting back in it, and, with
fear in his eye and consternation in his voice,
he grasped my arm, and said : “ I say, I say,
isn’t that —ah —strap too tight round the horse’s
—ah—rum—ah—legs?” When I recovered I
informed him that it was a patent, and would
automatically loosen when we reached the bottom.
And the worst is these chumps never learn, and
are a nuisance, anyhow.

“Periwinkle ” : Up Kyabram (Vic.) way,
where most of the native insectivorous birds have
been poisoned off with grain supplied by the
shires—at cost price, if not free —the farmers are
now 7 breeding turkeys as fast as they can to com-
bat the threatened locust invasion, due about
Christmas. Round the Cobram district the insects
are reported to be in trillions in the hopping
stage, and locust crops are hatching weekly, with
the promise of a humming time for the cocky
shortly. The native birds, that claimed toll of
the farmer’s handful of cherries after toiling in
the larvas haunts all the year round, are not alto-
gether lamented as yet, for cocky, always with an
eye to the main chance, really believes he can
fatten his Christmas fowl on the locusts. Yet my
money is on the locust every time, once he gets
into his stride.
Hassan: “D.B.”(B. 19/10/’O5) inquires
about the diet of the water tortoise, presumably
Cheludino longicollis. I have one which, during
winter, sleeps much and eats nothing. But in
summer his menu consists of flies, small tadpoles,
and the larvae of the mosquito. He lurks on the
bottom of his bowl, and as they flit innocently by
engulfs them with great deliberation. He can
account for a hundred or so a day. I think if
“D. 8.” examines the water of that tank in
summer he will find these larvae in it. But in
winter there is very little insect life either in the
water or on land. Hence, no doubt, the hiber-
nating habit of so many reptiles, the species best
adapted to go without food in winter being those
which now survive.
FOOTPRINTS IN THE DUST OF SIN.
THE TRAVELLIN "SALVO”: “And haven't you
found the Lord, my dear friend?”
MY DEAR FRIEND: “Well, I cravscd someone's
tracks ’bout four miles bad, but I dunno who
the 'ell it was.”
“Timbarra” sends a reckless statement: —
Surprised a tiger snake, the other day, with a piece of
fencing wire, and chopped his head and about 10 inches
of neck clean off. The body jumped 6ft. into the air, then
writhed all over the place, and the head ran round in
little circles, poking its tongue out in utter astonishment.
Whilst I was trying to get a clear grasp of things, the
head came at me with a vicious glitter in its eyes. I made
a swipe and missed. Then the body coiled round my legs
and I dropped the lump of wire and sprinted for home.
Returned with a long-handled shovel to flatten the head
out, but it had vanished, and only the dead body re-
mained. About a week later, when doing some clearing,
I found the head near a log, and it was still alive though
unable to move. Have known a black snake with a
broken back to live for six weeks, and an eel’s head to
bite after it was severed several hours.
SINCE FATHER WON THE SWEEP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Me father always drove a cab
Since I was but a kid ;
And sometimes made a crown a day,
And sometimes half-a-quid.
Me sisters at the fact’ry earned
A bit above their keep ;
And mother took in washin’ till
Me father won the sweep.
He saved a half a thick ’un
In shillin’s and in sprats ;
Then shoved it in a envelope
And sent it in-to “ Tatts.”
I wish he’d never done it, foi
The nightmare ’aunts me sleep,
And life is all a blanky dream
Since father won the sweep.
He got a ticket sent along,
And then a wire comes up
To say he’d drawn The Stiffun in
The bloomin’ Melbun Cup.
Then father wires the jockey quick S
“ A thousand quid you’ll reap
To nothin’ if The Stiffun lands
First money in the sweep.”
The day arrove, the race was run,
The news went flashin’ round—
The 'orse ’ad won, an’ father, too,
Five bloomin’ thousand pound 1
I never shall forget that night—
’Twould make yer marrer creep ;
For 'arf our street was shikkered up
When father won the sweep.
Me father chucked the cabs and now
He is a bloomin’ swell,
The lan’lord of a up-to-date
Suburb-i-an hotel.
He told the broker bloke he thought
The price was “pretty steep,”
The bloke replies : “ A fleabite to
The man what’s won the sweep.”
Me sister Mord’s gone on the stage,
She wants to be a star,
And Gwendorlean is servin’ drinks
In father’s private bar,
Where blokes come round to do a mash
And get their licker cheap.
“ ’Tain’t every lovely girl,” they say,
“ Whose father wins a sweep.”
And even mother puts on dorg ;
Instead of washin’ clothes
She’s took to wearin' ’em, no iess,
’lgh ’eels and drafty ’ose.
On Sunday nights She gives At ’Omes—
jg, ATwhflTd' make the angels weep
see the bloomin’ girls and ’er
' 'Since father won the sweep.
I’m stickin’ to the dealin’ trade,
I think I knows me book.
I’ll still be makin’ money when
Their big flash pub.’s gone crook.
They don’t ask me to no At ’Omes,
Me clobber is too cheap ;
The bloomin’ fam’ly’s gone to ’ell
Since father won the sweep.

“The Prooshan”: Re “F.C.” and his
essay with “Old Man” at his peach trees. Let
“F.C.”remember that Ispoke of youngtrees. I saw
a dozen young trees, two-year olds, looking clean
and healthy, and round each grew a clump of “ Old
Man.” The orchardist informed me that he had
planted the “ Old Man ” as soon as the trees went
into the ground. Now, I suppose “Fruit Chap
is going to lead a forlorn hope against some old
blighted veterans of twenty years insect accumu-
lation, and then come at me with his “blastiferous
peroration ” because the “ Old Man” can’t climb
the tree and capture the insects. If “F.C.”has
old blighted trees, let him lay open the roots for
3ft. in winter (frosty) weather, and in a month or
two re-cover with manure, and he won’t be troubled
with blight. This plan works as well with apples
as with peaches. #
“ Jim Pan ” : In the still-farther-out back
o’ Bourke, I recently sampled emu-egg omelette
for the first time ; and, behold, it was good ! Un-
expected absence of strong flavor.
Emu eggs are a splendid ingre-
dient for cake and brownie, and
are freely used by out-
baclcers (when they get
the chance) for egg-sand-
wiches. The eggs are
boiled up to 50 minutes ;
cut into thin slices, which
with pepper, salt and
damper make truly tooth-
some tucker. Emu steak
cut from the thigh is
coarse and dark; still it
is better than curried carney
and roasted mulga myrtles, which some are
supposed to be fond of.
COMING HOME.
“Drifter’s” tale of hazard by bike and
semaphore:—
Had one foot in the great doubtful Hereafter one night,
some years ago, but floundered out with a fractured rib
and a swelled head. I was employed as a line-repairer on
a section of the N.S.W. northern telegraph at the time.
There had been a thunderstorm during the morning, and
the telegraphist at Quipolly found that the line was
making earth between there and Quirindi. Got my kit
of tools and stepped out along the railway. A good many
miles from Quirindi a long tree-limb, blown down by
the gale, was hanging from the wire and carrying the
current to earth, thus causing the interruption. Got it
clear without breakage, then strolled into the township
for a drink. I only had one ;it was a beer. At the station
I borrowed the tricycle, asked the railway men if the line
was clear, and, being assured that no trains were ex-
pected, sat down and commenced to rattle along the
shining rails homewards. Twenty minutes later a light
engine stopped for a few moments at Quirindi, then
also left for Quipolly. The railway men had forgotten all
about the solitary man on the tricycle. It was a glorious
moonlight night, with a light mist veiling the gaunt gum-
trees that flew past me. I was plugging steadily along
at seven miles an hour, dreaming of some girl or other.
I could hear nothing above the clatter of the
tricycle, when, suddenly, a bright light flashed on the
handle-bar. I didn’t stop to yell—just dived down the
bank and did my yell in the air. Before my feet had
fairly left, I felt the flying engine strike the tricycle, and
caught a glimpse of a glaring pair of lamps. Then the
air was full of crash and splinters. Three hundred yards
further on the engine was pulled up. The driver, with a
white, scared face, came running back to inspect my
mangled remains. Seeing I was apparently uninjured, he
cursed me vigorously in the haggis language for not carry-
ing a light. Then we got aboard the engine, had a nip
from his flask, and ran into Quipolly. For fully six
months afterwards the sight of a railway tricycle made
me shudder.
“ The Prooshan ” : In almost every bush
community is found a noble fellow whose worth
is never adequately set forth or acknowledged.
He is not the champion f ulbback nor short-slip, nor
a returned warrior wet with gore ; he is merely
the man who goes for the doctor when sickness
comes upon his neighbor, or his neighbor’s wife
or child. No obstacle deters him, but, over range
and flood, this ministering angel speeds, losing
not a moment, pausing not to spare himself or
beast, and returning with a warrant of life for
his fellow. Bill’s wife is nervous—she mustn’t be
left alone. “You stop. Bill, I’ll go.” “Take
my coat, it’s like rain,” shouts Bill after
him. “Never mind me, Bill, I’m right—
you look after the missus,” he shouts. People
always fly to him; they seem to realise that
Providence has put him there to go for the
doctor. When he falls ill himself, he shuts the
door of his hut and lies low. He says he hates to
bother people when he’s sick.
“ Eoma ” : I am living in a centre of the
cow-raising business, but the only milk lots of
the people who aren’t in the cow trade ever
see is the condensed stuff that flows out of im-
ported tins. One township down this way (S.
Gippsland) can’t or won’t supply its local grocers,
post-office officials, and school-teacher with the
genuine article. They all have to take con-
densed.” One liberal-minded cocky opened his
heart and milk-can, and spared me half-a-pint per
day at the rate of 6d. a quart. As to honey, the
other celestial commodity—“ What, keep bees!”
Vegetables are not to be had for love or money.
I was supposed to be lucky because I procured
one cow-pumpkin for 6d. during the past five
months ; and pork and bacon are Xmas^ treats.
On the Ninety-Mile Beach, a long dreary
stretch of sand in eastern Victoria, are often to be
found articles which are produced in the northern
States. The writer has found the large Queens-
land beans, pieces of cedar logs, and once the body
of a leathery turtle —a species which is plentiful in
the Pacific Islands. A current sets down the east
coast of Australia, and meeting with another set-
ting east along the south coast, causes a swirl of
waters on a very large scale. The circular move-
ment continually grinds the bed of the Tasman
Sea, and the detritus thus formed is thrown up as
fine sand on the Victorian coast, causing the long
curved Ninety-Mile Beach. Then the flotsam of
the sea is thrown out on the same coast. Back of
the beach are parallel lines of sand hummocks.
As the sand is thrown up on the beach the wind
blows it inland, forming these successive ridges.
Between the ridges fresh water is obtained.
GOING TO THE RACES.
“P.A.”: With all the mention made of
bullock teams bolting, and tying themselves
up with the atmosphere in general, I
haven’t noticed one writer doing justice
to the bullocky’s dog. I once saw a
team of 16 bullocks stuck on a
black soil rise, with three big
mill logs as cargo. The cattle-
dog bit all the near-side bul-
locks, from the poler to the
leader, and then repeated
the dose down the off-side.
He stopped when he got to
the poler, meditating, as it
were, to see the result, but
never an inch could they shift it.
Then, as an afterthought, he bit
the man on the off-side, and, roaming
round to the near-side, bit his owner.
And when he saw that even then the load
failed to shift, he went away and bit himself.
After that he abandoned the job and sat down.

“Paul Cupid”: Most animals have a
natural dread of snakes. When a youth I was
ploughing some ground that had been turned over
and let lie for six months. Some days I ploughed
out as many as nine snakes. It was winter time,
and they never exhibited any activity. I always
exhibited plenty. A kangaroo dog was jumping
around a dead snake one day, and barking mono-
tonously. I tied the snake to the dog’s tail, and
the canine lit out for home like a streak of dis-
tressed lightning. It rushed through the house,
and made the flower garden look as if an earth-
quake had shaken it up, and then jumped a 6ft.
paling. There were three women in the house,
and their conflicting accounts of what they saw
have for ever shaken my faith in human testi-
mony. One said there were at least six snakes
with their fangs fastened on and about the dog’s
tail. Another said the snakes were coiled round
the dog and had its tongue forced out. The third
said that some were coiled round and some were
fastened on to the dog, but all said they did not
wait to notice particularly. That dog never
stopped to bark at a snake again, but threw him-
self headlong into the atmosphere and left like an
animal that was trying to miss an appointment
with the Devil.

“ H. J.L.” on the ox-ray, an alleged marine
monster, which this paper approaches with the
diffidence that is born of inexperience :
If the huge stingaree is called the “ devil-fish,” what
about his cousin, the “ ox-ray ” ? I have seen the latter
swarming in the heart of the Gulf during the N.W.
season, probably with a view to breeding. They would
bask indifferently round my boat, at times sounding,
monsters measuring 15ft. to 20ft. across, weighing, per-
haps, several tons each.
I don’t know if they are dangerous or not, no whip-tail
being apparent, but I did a mad thing once. I took a
large open rowing boat, with two men pulling, stood in
the bow with an iron-shafted spearpoised and a stout line
clear, drifted slowly on to one brute, and jumped full
weight on his carcase, driving the spear well home, turtle
fashion. Struck, of course, an almighty vibration, but
the spear held, and I scrambled back into the boat as the
fish sounded. The line, of course, ran out as if hell was
on the end of it. The ox-ray made a break for open
water. We managed to check the brute on the smoking,
rushing line, and in doing so I burnt my hands slightly
through the stupidity of my mates.
Then we became, for a matter of a quarter-mile or
thereabouts, an express motor-boat, travelling at the rate
of knots on a taut line. Suddenly the ray went perdu,
and we slowly hauled in on a slack rope, until there came
a sudden, unexpected commotion at the surface, an
almighty twist on the turned line, a broken snake-shaped
spear handle, and an awfully surprised ass lying on his
back kicking in the bottom of the boat. I decided to
let ox-rays alone in future.
THE BONDSMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There came last night with the wind the scent
Of bush and blossom and new shed rain,
And memory, schooled to a dull content,
Was up and away to the wilds again.
I saw the grass in its gala dress,
The promise that budded on leaf and bough ,
The infinite woodland restfulness ,
But I am chained to the city now.
I stood again where the lilies swayed
Like censers sweet on the broad lagoon ,
And gums, white-vested and priest-like, prayed
With outstretched arms to the placid moon.
The wind said “ Hush ! ” to the crowding trees
Where reed beds rustle and rushes bow.
O, for the balm of such scenes as these—
My soul is tied to the city now 1
The flute-like notes of the magpies stir
The waking world in the cool dim dawn ;
And gaily the grey philosopher
Laughs mortal effort and toil to scorn.
Tussock and thicket have hymns to raise,
Ten thousand voices their thanks avow.
A wonderful w'oodland fugue of praise
But the toils of the city are round me now !
O, bush beloved ! O, old best days !
When men were brothers and women good.
O, vanished scenes —but the glory stays,
Nor gone is the glamor of stream and wood.
Better the soul should be sad perchance
With only such joys as my dreams allow,
Than lost illusion and wrecked romance.
The chains of the city must save me now.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Old Queensland politician D. B. Morehead
and “Jimmy” Lowther, Speaker of the Com-
mons, were cousins.
Customs Minister Lyne is seriously indis-
posed. The Customs Department finds or makes
sick men. Kingston, M‘Lean, Fisher, Lyne—
three bad and the fourth middling.
The slide down the hill of teetotal repre-
sentation from John B. Gough, Neal Dow and
Abraham Lincoln in America, and Wilfrid Lawson
in England, to G. D. Clark and Tomato Jessep in
N.S.W., is so steep and deep that a man who
looked over it the other day called for a drink to
allay giddiness.
There has been a great mortality among
Australian ex-Premiers within the last year or
two. Dibbs, Throssell, Leake, Morehead, Dickson,
Herbert, Thorn, lieibey, Braddon, Berry, O’Logli-
len, Duffy, Gillies and Shiels have all dropped out.
But then there are so many ex-Premiers in a
country that runs seven Parliaments.
N.S.W. Senator Neild remains on the
very sick list, and is said to have developed
a “heart.” In which case he will probably not
be permitted to again plunge into the excitement
of a general election. Luckily for him, the next
three Senators to retire are Walker, Millen, and
Gould, and Neild’s job has still four years to run.
Decided by the Victorian Government not
to prematurely release “Temple of Truth” Worth-
ington, the gentleman with the beautiful grey
hair, and the romantic but aged deception, and the
charming but moss-grown fairy tale. Worthing-
ton’s health was said to be breaking down, but
the unfeeling doctors reckon that he is only
shamming, and doing it so badly that his symptoms
are like those of no disease on record.
Nurse Miller, one of the six nurses im-
ported by Parkes to teach the local ministering
angel how to marry the doctor or his patient, has
just reached her 82nd birthday in Melbourne,
bedridden, but strong mentally, and with all her
hair on in its original color. She once nursed
Alfred, formerly of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg,
but now elsewhere, and was trained under
Florence Nightingale, who also survives at the
age of 85.
The appointment of Joe Cook to" act as
deputy-leader of the importing and anti-Australian
party in the Representatives was the nastiest
blow Pumpkin Smith had received for a long
time. He fled from the House, went to Sydney,
and there he is reported to have sat in sackcloth
and ashes, rubbing grease on his head where the
hair won’t grow, and pulling out handfuls of long,
straggly whisker. When his rage had subsided,
the beautiful draggle of hair that adorns the ex-
tremity of his face was wrecked ; and he had to
remain in hiding for weeks until his only claim to
distinction had regained its normal appearance.
THE LATE BRYAN O'LOGHLEN,
One-time Premier of Victoria.
Michael O’Loghlen, father of the. de
ceased Bryan, was the first Roman Catholic
appointed to a judicial office in Ireland after the
passing of the Catholic Emancipation Act. Hq
became Master of the Rolls, The house of
O’Loghlen one of the Irish families supposed! to
bq attended by a banshee at the death of any of
its members. When Bryan’s elder brother,
Colrnan, a member of the House of Commons,
died suddenly on board ship, there was a long
newspaper controversy about thq banshee. Miss
Q’Loghlen, Colman’s sister, testified that at the
hour of his death she saw a, spirit on h,er hearth-
fug in Drumcondra, and exclaimed to those about
“ Colrnan is dead ! ” The banshee does not seem
to have followed Bryan to, Australia, though the
legend had always a fascination for him, and at
times he appeared to believe the old-land story.
The baronetcy goes to Bryan’s son, Michael.
Pleasing compliments passed between
Laud Mayor Pleasaunce, of Melbourne, and Board
of Works Engineer Tliwaites, as concerning the
municipal conference on the board’s delinquencies,
which conference gets no further with great per-
sistence. Pleasaunce: “Mr. Fitzgibbon’s atti-
tude is arrogant and dogmatic.” Thwaites:
“ The Lord Mayor displays an air of supercilious
superiority, and appears to object to anyone
breathing the same atmosphere as himself.”
The eloquent Dan. O’Connor, it has now
been finally arranged, goes to America shortly on
a lecturing tour with such rich subjects as “The
Womanhood of Australia ’’ and “The Poetry of
Australia” in his mental wallet. In U.S.A. they
can do some lofty soaring in the oratory line, but
it is doubtful whether they can produce a peer to
Australia’s Daniel. Mr. O’Connor will be asked
by his friends to accept a farewell testimonial be-
fore departure.
Rev. Carr-Smith gives up fashionable St.
James’s, Sydney, and returns to England. In
Beauchamp’s day he was appointed chaplain at
Government House, the first appointment of a
chaplain to that establishment since the very early
times. He conducted family prayers there every
morning, so the bachelor Governor and his house-
hold began the day piously. There was a small
salary attached to the appointment, but that Mr.
Smith paid over to city charities.
The young escapee aged eight, who dodged
the N.S. W.’s Children’s Court officials thefirst day
the new Act started working, has been re-captured,
after defying the law for six weeks. His family de-
ceived the police by dressing him in girl’s clothes,
but his violent and bushranging habits made it
impossible for him to live up to the disguise. He
has been handed over to a Hawkesbury River
farmer, and a long and dreary course of Cow will
probably break his spirit, and quite unfit him for
the Thunderbolt business.
Ages and dates of appointment of N.S.W.
Supreme Court Judges: Darley, Chief Justice,
born 1830, appointed 1886; Win. Owen, born
1834, appointed 1887; G. B. Simpson, born 1838,
appointed 1894; H. E. Cohen, born 1842, ap-
pointed Jan., 1896; A. H. Simpson, date of birth
unknown, called at Lincoln’s Inn in 1868, in
Sydney in the early 80’s, appointed 1897 ; Gregory
Walker, date of birth not known, called Lincoln’s
Inn in 1873, appointed 1898 ; R. D. Pring, born
1853, appointed June, 1902. The Chief and Jus-
tice Owen can retire at any moment on pension.
The late Bryan O’Loghlen, although a
stout lieutenant of Graham Berry’s at one time,
hadn’t the stuff of a sound democi .t, and showed
great tact in tacking when it seemed that
“ Berryism ” had almost run its course. Uphold-
ing the measure to prevent bribery and corruption
at the elections, O’Loghlen was alluded to by an
opponent as “the most disinterested and self-
sacrificing man in the House.” “Thank you,”
said O’Loghlen, warmly. “ Don’t, till I have
finished,” continued the other. “The lion, mem-
ber is self-sacrificing because he is opposed to the
distribution of free beer at election times, and yet
it is certain that no sober Liberal will ever vote
for him again.”
Bryan O’Loghlen, who died in Melbourne
last week, was one of the old fighting regiment
that ran Victorian affairs in the days when politics
were a series of pitched battles and sudden revolu-
tions. He was never a successful politician. He was
too much of a Celt —optimistic, mercurial, always
getting inspirations that he mistook for genius, but
which led to downfall. He first took a hand at
the political game in 1877, when he was defeated
by 16 votes at North Melbourne, and kept at it for
23 years. During that' period he was in and out
like a jack-in-the-box. In his time he tried four
different electorates North Melbourne, West
Melbourne, West Bourke, and Port Fairy. ’ He
was Attorney-General and acting-Premier in the
Berry Ministry in 1878, but lost his seat in 1880.
He wriggled back into the House, however, only to
get the cold shoulder from Berry. O’Loghlen
bided his time, and 12 months later overset
the Government coach with a want of confi-
dence motion. Then he formed a Ministry, which,
by the way, included Thomas Bent, and faced
the music with practically no following for 20
precarious months. Then the Berry-Service coali-
tion brought him down, and once more O’Loghlen
was without a seat. He got back again for Port
Fairy ; and in 1890 helped Jimmy Munro to turn
out the Gillies-Deakin Government. O’Leghlen was
Attorney-General in the Patterson Ministry for
nearly two years; but in 1894 the Ministry was
defeated, and Port Fairy threw him over. Next
elections, in 1897, he came back to the fight, and
once more secured the Port Fairy seat. He kept
it till 1900, when he dropped out of State politics.
The Commonwealth elections in 1903, however,
stirred up the fighting spirit again, and the old
Irishman, then in his 74th year,
stood for the Senate. He had no
chance, of course. O’Loghlen was
twice offered a seat on the Supreme
Court Bench, and twice refused. He
loved the smell of battle too much. As a
lawyer, he was second-rate, and he smudged his
record by using his position as Attorney-General
to protect the land and bank boomers in ’93.
He was almost a Democrat once, but drifted more
and more towards Toryism. He was a time-server
and an affable opportunist, and had no real
political principles. Still, he was a pleasant
gentleman, and filled the billet of an Irish baronet
well enough.
Melb, press notices of the late Bryan
O’Loghlen preserved a solemn silence re the inci-
dent by which he was best known to the younger
generation. He was the Attorney-General who
entered a nolle prosequi in the Davies case, with
the result that a Grand Jury intervened, and
Bryan’s nolle failed to keep the case from being
continued. Isaac Isaacs, the Solicitor-General
at the time, quarrelled with his superior officer on
the prosecution question, and got consider-
able popularity through quitting the Ministry.
O’Loghlen had then lost the confidence of the
Vic. public, for he was known to be suffering
from impecuniosity, an unpardonable weakness
in a man placed at the head of the Crown Law
Department. Rumor had it that the Attorney-
General was indebted to some of the very people
whose banking methods called for legal investi-
gation.
Ames Hellicar was last week appointed
superintendent of the Bank of Australasia—one
of the fattest billets in Australia. The bank has a
rule that every officer must retire at 60; but on
the requisition of the directors he may remain five
years more, at the most. The new chief has only
about five years to go to reach the retiring age.
But even in that time he will, at the present rate
of going, pay £1,250,000 in dividends to the mostly
English shareholders. Still this, anyhow, can be
said for the English shareholders, and it can’t be
said for some Australian States—if they do require
a man to pass out from the service at 60, they see
he passes out with a pension equal in most cases to
about two-thirds of Ins salary.
THE LATE BOYD DUNLOP MOREHEAD,
Sometime Premier of Queensland.
Photo, by Freeman & Co., Sydney,
Tait, boss of the Victorian railways, is
perhaps the most persistent cigar smoker in Mel-
bourne. On his office chair, on tram-cars, on
racecourse lawns, the fat, brown, half-smoked
weed rests constantly between his pursy lips, and
the rich aroma hangs ever in his thick silvery
hair. The railway porter, with six shillings a
day in one pocket and the sack in the other, gazes
on the mellow brown of that cigar, and becomes
filled with fierce socialist desires.
Concerning a good and useful citizeness :
Miss Catherine Helen Spence, Adelaide’s indefatigable
advocate of the Hare system of voting, celebrated her
80th birth anniversary on October 31st. She was born at
Melrose (Scotland), and is the only survivor of a family of
eight. J. B. Spence, a well-known Adelaide identity,
who died about three years ago, was her brother. Her
father, David Spence, was first town clerk in Adelaide—
the first municipality in Australasia. He died
in 1846, and his widow passed over in 1887,
aged 96. The family came to South Australia by
the ship Palmyra, in 1839. Catherine began to
forage for herself as a school-teacher when she was 17,
and remained in the profession until she was 25. Her
first newspaper work appeared in the South Australian,
then edited by her brother-in-law, Andrew Murray. Later
she! was Melb. Argus correspondent in Adelaide. Her
novel, “ Clare Morrison,” was published in London in
1854, followed in 1856 by “ Tender and True”—both yarns
of Adelaide life when the land was hot with the gold
fever. In 1859 an article, by J. S. Mill, concerning the Hare
system fired her with the idea that has animated her ever
since. She began her advocacy of the system with an article
to Melb. Argus, which paper enthusiastically dumped the
screed into the waste-paper receptacle. In 1861, Laving-
ton Glyde moved in S.A. Assembly for the adoption of the
Hare system, and Miss Spence backed him up in the press.
The motion was withdrawn, but Catherine still hammered
away in the papers, and published a pamphlet, “ A Plea
for Pure Democracy'.” In 1865-6 she visited Hare
and J. S. Mill in England, and put the former
in her next book, “Mr. Hogarth’s Will.” It
is said that the perusal of this novel caused
Edward Wilson, of the Argus, to alter his will, and leave
£5OOO a year to Melbourne charities. While in England,
Miss Spence contributed to the Fortnightly and Corn-
hill. She called her next novel “ Hugh Lindsay’s
Guest,” but publisher Bentley changed the title to “ The
Author’s Daughter.” Returning to S.A., she did some
lecturing, and in 1871 joined Miss Clarke in initiating the
boarding-out system for children, which is still going
strong. Later on, she lectured in the United States, and
in 1897 was a candidate for the Federal Convention, but
didn’t secure a seat.
John Logan Campbell, Auckland’s G.0.M.,
is just now solemnly amusing himself super-
intending the erection of his own statue at
the entrance to Cornwell Park, the fine recreation
ground on the slopes of One Tree Hill presented
by him to Auckland citizens. Sixty-five years ago
J.L.O. explored the shores of the Waitemata before
a solitary white man had settled there. He went to
Maoriland in 1839 as a doctor on an emigrant ship.
The London agents advertised as inducement to in-
tending passengers that she carried “a cow and a
surgeon.” The suggestion that the cow was of
more importance than the surgeon has ever since
been one of the old man’s humorous grievances.
“F.” on a person just deceased :
Hawkins, the hanging Judge (afterwards Lord Bramp-
ton), put up an English Criminal Court record, some 30
years ago, by his bloodthirsty direction of the Staunton
case. Harriet Staunton, a woman of weak intellect, had
died while under the care—or the didn’t care—of her
husband, his brother, his brother’s wife, and the girl ser-
vant of the household, whose relations with the husband
were of a tender nature. The four people were brought
to the Criminal Court on a distinctly strained charge of
starving Harriet Staunton to death. Hawkins made it
his business to get them all convicted of wilful murder.
He smacked his lips over the four death sentences, and
gave the prisoners no hope of mercy. Then public
opinion swung round in favor of the heartless quartet.
The Home Secretary was petitioned to move in the
matter, and the end of it all was that the three Stauntons
—husband Louis, brother Patrick and his wife—were
found guilty of manslaughter, or wilful neglect, whilst
the girl was set free, on the ground that she had owed no
duty to the imbecile wife of her paramour. Judge Hawkins
stood convicted of unfitness for the Bench in not having
instructed the jury that a servant, acting under
a master’s instructions as to the feeding of his wife,
couldn’t have been legally responsible for her alleged
death from starvation. Two or three years later Hawkins
repeated his previous mistake on a smaller scale. In this
case a man was charged with the murder of his wife by
encouraging her to drink herself to death. Hawkins was
for hanging him, but after his conviction the medical evi-
dence supported a petition for a reprieve, and the Judge
was again discomfited. The woman had not actually died
of alcoholic poisoning, but of dropsy or what not. There-
fore the husband didn’t murder her in the legal sense of
the word by plying her with liquor. Some people main-
tained that Hawkins was a humane man led into these
judicial errors by honest indignation against despicable
prisoners. But he looked a flinty fellow, nor had he
shown any kindness of heart during his career at the Bar.
Probably he loved to lash himself into a fury in the in-
terests of the gallows.
To which another man adds this postscript:—
Hawkins was at least a source of steady income to the
press and of occasional income to parsons. I was in
Glasgow at the time of the Staunton case, and our most
sensational parson, Rev. Donald Ferguson, advertised a
Sunday evening sermon on it. The congregation was
tremendous ; perspiration ran down the walls and pillars ;
the collection was large, and the place was full of breath
and semi-hysteria. The crowd got value for its money.
For an hour while Parson Ferguson spoke we could hear
the creak of the gallows, the gurgle of the hanged, the
groaning of the unoiled hinges of the gates of hell if the
four didn’t repent, the rolling of their chariot wheels up
the golden streets if they did. We could even hear the
grass growing and the rain raining on four graves wherein
lay four people with broken necks. And then, after his
last great whoop and his last yell and blood-curdle, Rev.
Ferguson held up his hand for dead silence, and let his
coat-sleeve drop back and reveal his cuff. Everybody
stopped breathing and waited, thinking that an extra
horror was still to come. We could hear an insect
buzzing on the sacred volume. We could hear a dog two
miles off. Then Rev. Ferguson told us that the whole
crowd had been reprieved. The telegram had come just
before the sermon commenced, and he had had it in his
tail pocket all the time.
Boyd Dunlop Morehead, ex-Premier of
Bananaland, and for 40 years mixed up with the
politics of that State, is dead, aged 62. He was a
native of Sydney, and a University graduate. In
1866 he went to Queensland to follow pastoral
pursuits. Afterwards he founded the firm now
known as Moreheads, Ltd. In 1871 he became
member for Mitchell, and displayed some
ability. Nine years later he was P.M.G. in
a MTlwraith Government, and held the posi-
tion for 2J years. In 1888 he was Colonial
Secretary under M‘llwraith for six months,
and succeeded him as Premier. His Ministry
lasted but 20 months, and went to the wall on the
question of a property tax. Morehead had to be
a pro-squatter, though he had a sneaking regard
for the interests of the small man, preferring the
leasehold tenures. But he was joined with that
hungry class which demanded more and more, un-
til it provoked the revolt—the windy revolution in
land legislation which saw its completion in 1884,
In 1896 Morehead drifted to the Upper House
among the nominee fossils. He was in the fore,
front of the Queensland boom party and went
down with the burst in 1893. At one time he was
very wealthy, but was hit heavily by the Mount
Morgan collap e. He also floundered in the wreck
of the Q.N. Bank, and stood his trial with his
co-directors. This struck him hard, and after that
he decayed with great rapidity. In his earlier
days he looked like joining the democratic ranks
in politics ; atone time he even coquetted with an
offer to lead the Labor party. He was a good de-
structive critic, but of constructive ability he had
practically none, and he knew it. A good trait
in the man’s character was his consideration to his
employees, and his generosity was so well-known
and boundless that he became the sport of every
impostor, especially during the boom days when
money was plentiful.
In Wallace Nelson, dropped out at the
selection of Labor candidates, W.A. Parliament
loses its most interesting figure. A brilliant
speaker, witty and humorous, no man in the
House was so eagerly listened to or so little re-
garded. Nelson is a champion of lost or out-of-
the-way causes—Socialist, Home Ruler, Secularist,
Malthusian, &c., &c. He was born in Aberdeen,
and describes himself as “a Scotchman, to the
best of his ability.” He was a secularist lecturer
in England and Queensland, and, later on, Labor
editor at Rockhampton and candidate i>r Parlia-
ment. He left Queensland in 1901 to take charge
of the Westralian Worker. From that paper he
shifted to the Kalgoorlie Sun, and later left the
Sun to start Figaro, which soon petered out.
Then he took over Perth Democrat, nursed it,
buried it, resurrected it, and buried it again. He
is now running the Labor page of the Perth Daily
News. Elected to Parliament in the Labor in-
terest last year, he made more speeches and moved
more motions than any other man in the House.
He was selected to oppose Daglish for Subiaco,
but retired owing to dissension in the Labor ranks.
But he will come again; a Scot from Aberdeen
always does.
The two ex-Premiers Morehead, of
Queensland, and O’Loghlen, of Victoria—who
died within a day or two of each other, were both
long past their financial prime. Morehead was
still the figurehead of the business which was once
all his own, but he never recovered from the
shock of ’93. O’Loghlen was practically a financial
wreck. Sometimes, as in the case of Braddon,
Leake, Service, Dickson, Byrnes, Shiels, and
Jennings, an Australian Premier manages to race
the spectre of Impecuniosity to the grave and to
get there first, but quite as often he doesn’t.
Parkes, Gillies, Berry, Thorn, and O’Loghlen were
four pathetic instances in which the spectre won
the race with a lot in hand.
WOMEN IN WINE SHOPS.
A bill has been introduced into the Victorian Assembly
prohibiting any licensed person from employing a woman
or girl in a wine shop, excepting his mother, wife,,
daughter, or sister, and also from allowing any woman
to loiter about the premises.
CONSTABLE: “ Now look here, Zumstein, you know
that kind of thing’s not allowed .”
ZUMSTEIN : “ Von moment, stupid Herr Police-
mans. How do you know dot dot lady villi-
not he mine modder?"
“F.” about a delusive bird :
Wren, the tote man, is quite seriously spoken of by
some of the Melbourne Labor party as a devoted demo-
crat, and friend of the working: man. The suggestion
that the eternal shilling tote, having its agencies all over
the place, proves an awful snare to the working man and!
his wife is met with always the same gag, “It gives them-
Hope.” Wren is the humanitarian who confers the bless-
ing of Hope upon struggling punters by charging them.
10 per cent, on every shilling they speculate—the hope of-
winning eighteen pence on a favorite, or a rare occasional-
fifty shillings to one who chances to pick the needle from-
a bundle of hay. The difference between the every day,,
mind-disturbing tote, and the incidental Tatt.,isthat the
first represents a certain loss to the punters who punt
constantly, whereas the other offers the wild hope of a-
fortune to its followers without distracting their thoughts-
daily from their toil. But Wren is a natural enemy to
Tatt. The rival Hope doesn’t develop a mania for trying
to spot the winner. Indeed, the majority of Tatt.’s-
patrons care nothing for horse-racing.

HOW TO BE BEAUTIFUL.
Valaze preparations are still on top. None better are to
be found in the world. Mdlle. H. Rubinstein travelled far
and wide for a skin food to beat Valaze ; she didn’t find it.
All the champion centres of skin culture in Europe were
searched through and through. Result —Valaze prepara-
tions triumphed. Valaze preparations are on top of the
beauty producers of the world ! Valaze preparations are
the sole creators of cream and roses in the face of woman.
Nothing to eclipse them or come near them on earth.
Better news still ! Study in the most famous laboratories
of the world’s skin specialists has resulted in the establish-
ing of Massage Parlors at 274 Collins-street, where fair
woman finds a new skin, a fresh bloom, a new beauty of
form and face. No need to go disfigured, to be ugly, unat-
tractive, with skin marred or blemished ; the scientific skin
treatment at 274 Collins-street will rectify all that. Miss
Rubinstein and her two Viennese assistants conjointly,
with a replete electrical apparatus, effect miracles. Moles,
warts, superfluous hairs, wrinkles, double chins, disfigure-
ments of all kinds are removed. The face blooms afresh.
Nothing is impossible. Scientific Massage treatment, a
steady use of Valaze, the herbal soap will effect wonders.
The faded, withered skin disappears. The greatest
specialists in Europe have trained, taught, instructed Miss
Rubinstein and her assistants. Certificates bearing the
most eminent signature in the world’s list of skin specialists
testify to the fitness of these ladies. All Australia should
ring with the news of their coming—it is an epoch. Valaze
was a boon—now, in addition, is the Scientific Massage
treatment, and a host of new Polish preparations for re-
fractory disfigurements. The jaded society woman, the
tired theatrical, the weary singer, all have a chance of
fresh beauty and bracing up. No one need despair—there
is hope for the plainest, the most world-fagged. The age
of miracles is not past—be ugly, be discontented, be cross,
be peevish ho longer. The best Scientific Massage treat-
ment and beauty preparations in the world are \ours for
the asking. Mdlle. Rubinstein, on her return from Europe,
brought out some most wonderful beauty-giving prepara-
tions, which have never before been within the reach of
Australians, as well as the Scientific Massage treatment,
and the marvellous amount of good one can receive by
spending a few shillings in the Massage Rooms, or on some
of the special preparations for blackheads or other dis-
figurements, or a set of the Massage Rollers, for using in
one’s own home, will be thoroughly appreciated.
Call in when passing 274 Collins-street (over Glen’s),

rewarded. To suit your convenience, a telephone appoint-
ment can be made if .you ring' up 4361. Note new address.

“ Be Wise in time and Beautiful for ever.”*
It is generally thought that there is no
cure for stoutness, because the usual treatments
only confine themselves to combating single
symptoms instead of attacking the root of the
disease. Pyrolene Pellets remove not only the
superfluous fat, but also the internal deposits of

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
_ , Sydney, November 7, 1905.
My Dear Arini,—
Lady Fanshawe’s good-bye to Sydney was said
at her garden party amid a blare of band and a
crush of painted muslins. The .Lady-o’-war did a
lot of charitable work here, and got along capitally
with the good, groovey women who pride them-
selves on following the traditions of the late
V-TTv, B r id &e-playing and fleet-pursuing Sydney
flidn t like her, and insisted that she didn’t like
Australia, or its girls, or the wearing of lace
petticoats.
Mayoress Allen Taylor must be tactful. She
has got Lady Jersey to forego her mournful inten-
tion of staying away from the Big Reception at
the Town Hall. The cancelling of that frisk
would have meant considerable loss to caterers
and florists. The flower lady who is to direct the
decorations got up from Melbourne a huge lot of
glowing lilies of the valley, so the air around the
dais will nimbly and sweetly recommend ” unto
the Jerseys gentler senses. Reception is fixed
for the 21st.
Vera Isley, a Chatswood girl of 15, has been
chosen out of 200 to sing at the Public Schools
concert to the Jerseys on the 21st.
Mrs. George Harris, one of the Harris clan
which owns the populous part of Sydney known as
Ultimo, has donated £lOOO out of her share of that
unattractive but remunerative suburb to the
ihirlmere Home, which it is proposed to convert
into a Women’s Consumptive Home. Owing to an
idea that the buildings at Thirlmere are impreg-
nated with phthisis germs, the proposed resurrec-
tion of the charity has lain dormant for some
time. Its sudden revival is another story.
The Jerseys’ son-in-law (one of them), Lord
Dunsany. has achieved a book of imaginative
prose, “ The Gods of Regana. ” It is due for debut,
and will be well illustrated. Dunsany’s marriage
to Lady Beatrice Villiers occurred last summer.
An Englishwoman has been taking
notice of and commenting on Austra-
lian women’s dress. Commentator isn’t
one of those golf-eomplexioned women
with large tan feet, sagging coats and
skirts, an expression that suggests
“ We are chocolate creams, you are
plain, boiled bull’s-eyes ” whom we see
about The Australia in tourist season.
She’s a dresser of taste and originality,
and she asserts that Australiennes
“follow the fashion ” blindly and with
little regard for individual appearance.
Napoleon hats are in ? All Australia
wears ’em. Is the torpedo toque ar-
rived ? We are all torpedoed. Are
hats worn over the eyes ? Then let us
all wear ’em so. Yet if you have fine
eyes hats so worn will disguise the fact,
and if you have a wide mouth and a
jaw like Madame Humbert’s, the
lurched headgear will accentuate those
plain truths. Gathered skirts are worn
by the stout and the skinny, and if a
woman be strong-minded enough to
insist on her skirt being made other-
wise, her dressmaker says, “Well,
don’t say I made this dress. It will
look so out of date.” In Europe, says
the commentator, fashionable women
don’t assume a kind of uniform at
the bidding of costumieres and tailors.
They dress their bodies to suit their
figures, and hat their heads to suit
their faces, and fix their hair to suit
themselves. Of course, none of them
goes in for freakishness—such as
chignons or crinolines. For nearly 30
years the Queen of England has dressed
her hair in the one style—the style
most becoming to her. And the fashion
of her skirts, with their long, sweeping
lines, alters scarcely at all. Yet she never looks
rococo.
Miss Eadith Walker’s good-bye ball to the
Euryalus officers was a strong finish. If you but
.heard the gourmet guests enthusiastically retro-
spective over the tiny five-weeks-old hot roast
chicken, one to eaqh guest, served with radium sauce
(sounds like Emily Soldene)! Really it was good to
be there. Each got a present. There were chiffon
scarves, silver frames, silver pincushions, and
musical toys—the man with one brand of musical
toy ran about_ till he found the lady with a toy
the twin of his own, and with her he had to
dance.
Miss Nor ah Dangar—the one with the dimples
—led off the cotillon with Mr. Monty Walker,
one of^ the twin brothers, cousins of the hostess.
Miss Eadith’s entertainments are good for trade.
She says to the florists “Doit,” and they do—to
the extent of many hundreds of pounds’ worth of
blooms. It sounds like a mixture of Jenkins
ordering it to be done properly in Mel-
bourne and the command that things shall be,
and they were, in Genesis. Miss Eadith’s
late father left her over two millions, all solid
money or property—not windy investments or
wild cats. Possibly the lady will one day marry.
If she does it will most likely be an athletic, long-
limbed curate. A picture showing a curate, with
a Robert Elsmere face, playing a violin, would
certainly find a purchaser in Miss Walker. (This
kind of curate always swears once in the course of
the novel, and has one fight, in which he knocks
the wicked coal-heaver into the next parish.)
Apropos (not very though) of pupils fainting
during physiology lesssons : A few years ago at
Liverpool public school a heavy boy playing leap-
frog bumped on to a small boy, one of wnose legs
snapped with an awfully audible report. So blood-
curdling was the shriek he gave that five boys in
succession dropped, fainting. The master, to break
the spell, hurriedly rounded up the youngsters,
and marched them into school. But the faints
went on till another five boys had deposited them-
selves about the place. Then the distracted master
desk a great imperial whack, exclaiming
" -The, next that faints I shall thrash.” There was
no “ next” ; so the spectacle of an insensible hob-
bledehoy being caned didn’t eventuate.
It’s a hard thing to drag the kite from the
carcase. Sydney papers are now forbidden by
the Divorce Judge to print evidence in divorce
cases. In the sensational Dailey v. Dailey case,
now proceeding, they, however, satisfy the morbid
taste for such stuff by printing the whole
of counsel G. H. Reid’s opening address
for the petitioner—hardly a fair thing to
do from any point of view, for it gives the case
against the woman a long start of any possible
contradiction. If the judges wish to protect the
public from the printing of Divorce evidence they
should make a rule prohibiting publication of any-
thing but the issues and the findings.
Up, the line is a family, the heads of which
haven’t spoken to each other for ten years. Yet
they live in the same house. It seems that, long
ago, Popper paid a great deal of attention to a
young wife who lived with her husband on the
opposite side of the street. The young husband
divorced her ; but Popper’s wife, for the children’s
sake, wouldn’t divorce him. So he is now only
the man who supplies the cash, and when he is
present his wife looks right through him at the
scenery beyond.
A lady who was once of some social note in
Sydney is, through stress of circumstances, keep-
ing a boarding-house. She gets up at 5 a.m. and
goes for her fish and vegetables. Other morning,
as the rising sun was turning the harbor to rippled
ruby, she was coming home by an obscure road,
when a bleary-eyed man who was opening the
doors of a little faded public-house, balanced up
MRS. FRANK GARDNER AND CHILD.
to her and eagerly, yet respectfully, entreated her
to come in and have a drink. “I’m the landlord,”
he explained. “ Don’t yous remember me ? I used
to be your butler.”
Concerning dogs. There was a collie at recent
Kennel Club’s show that I would willingly have
changed faces with (O, yes, through the stilly
night I can hear my enemies’ chorus of approval,
‘‘Any exchange would be an improvement”).
This collie—he was numbered 90—had a white
face, an intelligent forehead, and the finest brown
eyes I ever saw. They were not the eyes of a
lower animal. They had antiquity in them,
and poetry, and introspection, and composi-
tion, and a deep love for philanthropy and
art and old church architecture ; in fact, a very
superior human seemed to look through
them. The way I congregated opposite him (her)
and wished for his (her) head ! When" I men-
tioned my desire to a sympathetic man, he
pointed out that, beautiful as the collie’s head
was, it wouldn’t be a success on a human being.
None of my hats, for instance, would fit it, aiid°l
would have to bore holes through the ears and run
a string through them to hold the hat on with. I
fully _ recognise the inscrutability of the ways of
Providence. He gives the finest head to the hat-
less dog.
From S.M. Herald :
T ADY wanted, good figure, as Study for picture
postcards.
Is the lady wanted in her clothes or out of them ?
That’s what a lot of applicants for the “billet”
have asked of the advertisers.
A parson who guides most of the soular system
of a big parish of this State says he’d be so
delighted to baptise a Merely Mary Ann. Says
it’s a sweet name. Out of the four hundred odd
infants he has baptised there was not a single
Jane, Anne, Catherine, Rachel or Alice. Mary
is rare. The fancy of the name-givers ran for
long, in the case of girl babies, to Tennysonian
names such as Elaine and Ida. Several pairs of
twins were named Edith and Evelyn (in memory
of “The Sisters” probably), and when those fas-
cinating books by the writer of “Elizabeth and
Her German Garden” were popular there
was a slight run on the names June and
April. Rubys, Muriels, Marjories, and Ethels
have a steady call. “ Once, ”he says, “I told a
mother who had come unprepared with a name,
that I thought thenames of Sarah and Jane amongst
the sweetest I knew. She looked live coals at me
for a minute, then walked out of the church and
got her infant baptised elsewhere.”
Cables mention contralto Sylvia Blackstone’s
successful appearance at a concert in London.
Little Sylvia was a beaver for work, and as she
has a good voice to work on hope tells a flattering
tale.
Decima Moore’s new husband has a name such
as Dickens might have used. Guggisberg is the
bridegroom elect, and he has been Director of
Surveys on the Gold Coast for years. Decima,
presumably, calls him “Guggy.”
I see by an evening paper report that a Sydney
racing man, Mr. Glenister, had his gold time-
piece, chain and “appendices"’ stolen in Mel-
bourne. To what insolence has the thief come
when even a man’s appendix isn’t safe from light
fingers !
MR. FRANK GARDNER,
of a recent cause celebre.
Violet Mount has
taken her soprano
voice and her little
mother away to other
climes and audiences.
For so popular a
voice her benefit was
not a financial suc-
cess. To have a real
good-bye musical suc-
cess in Sydney the
benefiter must ally
herself with some re-
ligious’ism, and make
loud and frequent
profession of her
leaning in that direc-
tion. And she must
lean at an angle of
at least 45 degrees.
A mere gentle slope
is no good at all.
“The gown for tiger shooting is, of course, green,
and as simple as possible, the skirt being unlined.”
That, from an English paper. Said gown is one of
the Princess of Wales’ outfits for India. I shouldn’t
think the tiger would mind the lack of lining
in the skirt. And he won’t bother about its sim-
plicity either. When the lady and the tiger
meet it will be Princess, not fashion, he’ll take.
Those Australiennes who left for the Durbar last
week (by the way, Miss Irene Marks, who got off
yesterday, has been about in queer green raiment,
which is probably her tiger-hunting frock), ought
to bring back some plain tales from the jungle.
But I simply pant for information now
about the right color and fashion for a
lady’s wliale-fishing costume, and if no one
can tell me what clothes she should wear to
pursue the wild ass in Persia I may have to fall
back upon medical aid. Only H.R.H.’s tiger-
icide and knock-about gowns were made in London.
State frocks are being “created” in Paris.
There are several gowns of grey alpaca
and grey cashmere trimmed with Russian silk
braid or white kid. Predominant colors are greys,
browns, greens, and many whites. “Their chief
characteristics are elegant simplicity and a
moderate amount of trimming.” Another feature
is, that the skirts are nearly all plainly hung, very
few being pleated. The lines of “building” in
all give an effect of the now fashionable “slim-
ness.”
The chairs and ornaments in Lord Kitchener’s
house are said to be arranged like soldiers on
parade, and lack the touch of a woman’s hand.
It would advertise Australia better than aCogh-
lan Times letter if an Australian girl married that
man and disarranged those ornaments.
Signora Fabris wants to go and lay her Italian
bones among the ilex and olive of her native Italy.
She is very large and dark, and no one seeing her
now would think that she had played the bright
“skipping” parts in opera in Sydney 25 years ago
to madly-applauding audiences. As Azucena in
“Trovatore ” and the page in “ Un Ballo” she
was a real bird. With the Signora was associated
the pale tenor Paladini, who later was employed
at, and died in, a pork-pie establishment. Sub-
scriptions to enable the Signora to realise her
desire to return to her native land may be sent to
Mr. Southwell at Paling’s.
There’s a new crime—that of being “ after-
noomsh in the morning.” You ought not to go
a-buying in Paddy’s Market in the forenoon,
dressed in chiffon and diamonds.
Have just seen a picture of a galvanic kitchen,
shown at an Electrical Exhibition in London.
Preparation and cooking of food are done by
ohms and volts. You put your ohm in the stove
and light it with your volt, and there you are.
If the innovation becomes general the domestic
servant problem will be as good as solved. As a
writer remarks, “Woman’s sphere in the future
will be pressing buttons instead of sewing them
on.”
Miss Carrie Lanceley—she is a Madame Chris-
tianize—knocked a luminous hole in the rather
dreary dusk of Liedertafel’s special grand concert
last week. Her (soprano) voice is fresh as a spring
sunrise and is moreover used with brains. Mr.
Mowat Carter and his fiddle conspired in an
Andalusian Romance, tender melancholy shot
with fire.
A golden wedding was celebrated last week in
Bathurst—that of Mr. J. H. Stewart, of Mount
Pleasant, near Esrom, who, in 1855, married a
daughter of Methodist minister W. B. Boyce.
Mr. Stewart is son of Colonel Stewart, of the 3rd
Buffs, who arrived in Sydney in May, 1825, with
the regiment. He brought with him an order for
3000 acres on account of services in the Peninsular
War, and he bought many thousand more acres.
After service in India, where he rose to be a full-
sized general, he returned to N.S.W. and settled
at Mount Pleasant. For 12 days he was acting-
Governor between the departure of Governor
Brisbane and the arrival of Governor Darling.
The General is buried on the highest hill on the
Mount Pleasant estate with an obelisk over his
bones.
Sydney is tenorised by two visiting high C—ers
just now. Percy Denton (who carries a quite
unnecessary accompaniment which would dis-
appear with physical culture) and Kilburn-Heron.
hirst from M.L., second from Melbourne.
The late Peter Nicol Russell’s will is very hard
on the Proctors. You remember Thea Proctor,
the poster artist ? Her mother was a niece of the
deceased millionaire, who seemed well disposed
tow irds the gentle Thea and her brother. They
haven’t got any legacy. Must be hard on a child-
less millionaire’s poor relations to see the wealth
going to charities.
Artist Sid Long is these days working at a set
of panel decorations for a Westralian client’s
Perth house. The overmantel panel will repre-
sent a bush fire, and there’s another showing a
flight of white cockatoos.
Mr. T. M. Slattery’s house—or rather Mrs.
Scanlon’s house recently occupied by the late-
exited Slatterys—has been taken by the. Earaa-
ciottis. Another very desirable and castellated
humpy at Rose Bay, lately occupied by the
Smellies and belonging to the Dangars, is now in-
habited by the Von Buris. He is Consul-General
for the country whose ruler is the bluebottle of
Europe. Frau von Buri is clever, and viewy.
Talking of Rose Bay. Within a small space of
that sweetly-named suburb there are 17 stylish
childless wives. The whole 17 were lately flutter-
ing at a private garden fete, and another guest, a
lady who has achieved nearly 17 inheritances
from the Lord, contrived to say to the majority of
the smart wives, "What a pity there is no one
from your house to come to my children’s party.”
Mrs. Barbara Baynton’s book “Human Toil”
is due for publication. The writer and her daughter
are in Paris, and will return to London in time for
presentation at the first Court of next year. Miss
Essie is, as Pepys might remark, “a mighty
pretty creature,’’ and she will ornament the Court
and at the same time advertise Australia and her
Ma’s book.
Mr. G-. H. Reid, in that recent speech of his in
which he made the startling confession that it
took him ten years to pass his first law exam., also
flung a brick at Australian snobbishness. The
form of snobbery that won’t visit the woman next
door because her husband sells pies retail, whilst
the snob’s husband sells them wholesale, is as
common as dusty days. There’s one lady here
specially remarkable for the way her head grows
out over the sidewalk as the years go on.
She begs her friends never “to put her in
the painful position of meeting persons in trade.”
And if by accident some hostess does introduce a
merchant’s wife to her she gives the latter the
ice-water eye. She is not an old woman, and the
majority of Sydneysiders remember when her
parents kept a very modest pub., and her hus-
band’s parents an equally modest boot shop. If
a woman puts on snob airs to other women she’s
bound to have her cheap twopenny past raked up
and bandied about amongst the snubbed. Other-
wise it would be forgotten.
Miss Constance Dansie, the elocutionist, will
give a recital on Thursday evening. Amongst
the clever assisting talent will be Mr. R. L.
Neild, whose singing of "The Heart Bowed
Down ” in a recent performance of “The Bohemian
Girl ” is not forgotten.
Saw a hat on Saturday that was rather a
novelty. It was a small white chip straw, turned
down all round the brim, but round the edge of
the crown was a trimming of pearl beads, as large
as marbles, and on the brim a couple of bunches
of pearl grapes with foliage. Evidently an “ad-
vance copy, ” for fashion writers are promising a
pearl plague.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, November 6, 1905.
My Dear Yarrie, —
A damp, gusty, blue-nosed Derby upset many
calculations. Half the usual dressy crowd sulked
at home. The other portion went out in dejected
spirits and the new season’s dust-wrap. Some
remained trim and taut in the storm-sheet
all the day. Others shed it when the rain
left off, and flaunted tlitsir frillies on a de-
serted terrace. The winter-garbed stuck like
leeches to the Stand seats, and saw the valiant
sisterhood mop the wet tiles with its muslin tail.
Two Quakerish figures snuggled into a corner of
the State Governor’s pen, Miss Stuart-Wortley
and Mrs. Bertram Hawker of Adelaide.
Under the better sheltering palms the
Federal Ex. (only himself out) and a long
line of black top-hats saw the favorite home
with a good deal of under-done excitement. Two
or three attempts were made on the part of the
whole Flemington populace to be gay, but always
a sharp shower put the flickering gaiety dead
out. The owner of Lady Wallace was
one of the dreariest figures astrut. Squat-
ter Macdonald seemed to feel the alternate
grit and slush as keenly as the saddest backer on
the course. His station, Muckabunda, above the
Murray border, is a prosperous run.
The Maddens have evidently started on seven
years of plenty. The plump clan burst out,
despite the Derby gales, in raiment of purple and
gold. The most opulent example was furnished
by Miss Lesly Madden, whose French frock of
sovereign silk hit the dismal crowd in the eye.
The garb had a gay promenade air, with its little
bird-like tails from the belt and its fussy elbow
sleeves. A French hat strewn with roses sup-
ported the golden intentions of the festive
garb. Mrs. H. Osborne, fresh from a harbor
flit, girded herself to the best of her stay-
ing powers in a marine blue. Two brave garbs,
kept uncovered through shade and shine,
belonged to Mrs. W. Croker and Mrs. Everard
Browne. Both were pastel blue, built superbly.
Miss Shylie Blue did herself up in a midwinter
rig of turkey red. The two Wallace wives were
striking figures, each on a separate beat. Opinions
were divided as to the better turn-out till Mrs.
Charlie started to go home, when her powder-pink
dust-coat brought the vacillating bun to her feet.
Mrs. Harry Payne wore a remarkable blue turn-
out with a dado in a darker tone.
The Derby figure suggested that something like
hydraulic pressure must be needed to get some of
the corpulent into a straight-front. One beefy
dame from the most particular quarter of Toorak
had got herself compressed marvellously into a
fairly moderate space. Nothing short of machine
power could have worked such a miracle, and her
arms had surely been slid in on a shoe-horn.
Another of the “middle-aged spreads,” as a local
cynic describes the fatal fat of the forties, turned
out squeezed into a girth-strap that completely
did away with the owner’s commissariat.
Miss Bose Musgrove and Miss Evelyn Scott
are flourishing brand new engagement-rings. The
stall johnnies are . much exercised in thought as a
result.
Lady Edeline Strickland is looking less Edeliny
than ever. Since her last Cup revel she has added
to her avoirdupois. At the Derby she wore
mauve silk, and looked much crushed by the head
winds. She persisted in tacking a course to the
lawn now and then with an Aide, whose efforts
not to swear at the boisterous weather resulted in
a double-pleated frown over his high-bred nose.
Tacking is an art. A lady buys a piece of blouse
or skirt material in the morning, and is eager to
wear it at a picnic in the afternoon. So the
blouse is . tacked together by stitches about
three inches apart. Recently, in King-street, a
girl of the giantess type, wearing a pink and amber
blouse covered with bee-spots and tiger-stripes,
held herself together till she arrived at the wind
that was tearing up Pitt-street. Then the bee-
spotted and tiger-stripe blouse began to wind and
flap round her pretty neck before it split in halves
and coiled round a verandah post. A passer-by
hauled it down politely; but the young woman
vanished in a cab at the moment when a lot of
other things threatened to untack.
A chubby little ingenue, during the last trip of
the Omrah across the Bight, gravely informed an
astonished dinner-table that her friends in Perth
had warned her, as she was travelling alone, “to
be sure not to go to any of the officers’ cabins to
look at the pictures.” Her information was re-
ceived in frigid silence that almost developed into
an iceberg when the maid asked, “ Isn’t it safe ? ”
The endeavors of the officers then present to look
like St. Anthonys didn’t relieve the strain, which
was near breaking point when some passenger
made an inane remark about the day’s run, and
another ope said in his blind haste that the en-
gineer must be cired with shoving the vessel on so
fast.
Latest thing in theatre wraps, or rather scarves,
is a glittering something that comes from Egypt.
About three yards length of strong silk and wool
net about three-quarters* of a yard wide, with
hundreds of thousands of atoms of pure silver-leaf
beaten into elaborate patterns through the mesh
the material. In Egypt the scarves are sold by
weight. There are a few in Sydney now, and they
appeared at a recent first night.
r £e H°ly City has contributed a big contingent
to the Cup. Things must be looking up over in
lortoise I own. Among others are the comic so-
ciety man, Mr. Julian Ayers, the Anstey couple,
who. are among the golf maniacs (he boasts of
cousinship to the author of the “Dolly Dialogues”),
and Miss Shylie Blue, who passes unrecognised in
this city. Ihe once plump charmer of the neigh-
boring State has lately wilted away to a lilv-like
slenderness.
The Stalls witnessed an impressive inci-
dent the last night “ The Orchid ” bloomed here.
When the farce was well on its giddy course two
superb dames with a squire apiece fussed and
rustled into the theatre. The orchestra was roused
from its automatic blow by the silken commotion.
Then it almost let the blow go to pieces and the
tune collapse when it saw two former chorus trip-
pers arrayed in all the grace and power of squatter
wealth. Never had the full significance of the
wealthy match occurred to the tired orchestra till
this Carnival night, when its two former favorites,
fresh back from a mighty gad, and laden with Paris
chiffons and glittering gems, stormed the seats of
the mighty.
MENTAL RESERVATION.
TEACHER: “ William, Henry, you're eating something
WILLJAM HENRY: “ No, I ain't.”
TRACHRR: "How dare you tell me such an untruth? You bad boy! You are eating something.”
WILLAM HENRY (triumphantly): “I ain’t, see! I'm suckin' it.”
Mrs. Maesmore Morris has picked up Consider-
ably since the wrench of the matrimonial bonds
by the court. At the “Orchid” show on Friday,
the lovely mummer was a fairer picture than for
many a day. With her were Mr. Dunne and the
Harcourt Beattys.
Some hundreds of golfers paddled oyer a wet,
swollen expanse that used to be the Sandringham
links last week. They guessed where the next
green (?) lay, and returned grace after the stroke
to find it wasn’t washed away each time. The
rain fell like a Noah deluge, and the paddlers
struggled on for three soaking hours in un-
precedented golfing weather. They played
in sacking, tarpaulin, tent-remnants, sailcloths
and potato bags. High leather boots were another
adventitious aid. The mixed couples had the
worst luck. Better weather prevailed for the
she-ehampionship, and a sudden burst of golden
sun was turned on the victory of the Adelaide
top-scorer, Miss Backhouse, who beat the much-
lauded Sydney, Maoriland and Victorian cham-
pions by three points, after three rounds of record
play.
The English chappie, Hon. Michael Scott, got
home again with the Australian Championship.
In fair weather or foul this pink-cheeked impor-
tation walks off with the. top record of the
Sandringham links. This tournament he was
merely backed for a place, but he cantered home
easily with an unapproached score.
The she-visitors in the Doubles Handicap car-
ried off the Friday Tournament golf trophy—Miss
Lewis of M.L. and Miss Nea Mort of Harbor-
ville. Both wet, wind-blown lassies played
against bad odds, the weather being loud, raw,
and given to most violent rainfalls. But the pair
kept up to dry form, and established an enviable
fame for good-humor, nerve, and equanimity.
One hard swear (between the two) at the appalling
tempest would have lost them the game.
Mrs. Arthur Sachse’s hospitable intentions
were spoilt by the Arctic storms on Monday.
Croquet had to be declared off, and the party
took its music and tea indoors. The wife of the
Minister of Education is the only identity of
State politics who extends claret cup and wafers
to the fashionable flock at frequent intervals.
The right hand of friendship is always desirable,
but doubly so when there is food in it.
Mrs. Archie Burt, one of the beauties this
State has contributed to the wild and windy
West, is revolving at the Cup revels. As Miss
Roberts, the youngish dame in question is remem-
bered as the most photographed charmer Mel-
bourne ever had.
The dame of the Military Commandant has
been at last tempted into gaiety. At the final
brass-and-braid hop of the season Mrs. Finn
showed forth in gold and white striped brocade,
black applique in lace adding a Spanish tone to
the rig. The General is the best liked chief this
State has struck.
The most astounding extreme to which the
Christian Scientist goes is furnished by an enthu-
siast, who claims to have married a brother of the
cult and yet to have retained her right to be men-
tioned as a Miss for all time. “ We’re married,
but we know wrn ’re single ! ” It seems that the
male in question consented to the matrimonial
blessing and label to oblige the whimsical lady, so
that they might progress together with C. S.
studies when and where they liked without
scandal. He is the enthusiast’s little tin duck,
and any arrangement for Heaven or earth has his
consenting.
The She Writers’ Club seems to have been insti-
tuted for the sole purpose of farewelling departing
chroniclers. Someone has been leaving every time
the club foregathers. On Friday night, Mrs.
Baverstoek (kindly remembered in Sydney as
“Cleo'’ of The Bulletin) was the party
farewelled, the parting tear being spilt
at the Paris Cafe. Mr. and Mrs. Isaacs sailed
in (at least the dame sailed, he merely
late, after dessert at the Northcote
board. Ihe Philip Fysh couple arrived early
and stayed late. The guest of the parting cup
passes from the perch of Australasian theatrical
critic to look after the woman’s matter in
Sydney D. I. Mrs. Baverstoek, as many Syd-
neyites know, is a daughter of that fine old
journalist the late David Blair, and is an
excellent newspaperman” herself. The D T is
lucky to get her.
There ls a later craze than the shelter for

Little Margaret Thomas (how killing Maggie or
Peg would sound !) relates naively that she used
to sing anywhere and everywhere a while back for
an advt. in the Cold Country. When she could
get a fee, in the days of her green youth, she
didn’t refuse it in an unnecessary spirit of self-
denial, but when she had no remuneration, she
satisfied herself with the advt. A starlet mummer
who is brave enough to tell these things of herself
is, of course, new to. a profession that generally
likes to have one Bishop in the family and landed
estates to its credit, and other myths of an en-
nobling character close at hand.
The manager of a large residential establishment
has a rule set forth in black and white, and
suspended over the-pantry-door or the kitchen
range, that servants must not bear tattle to and
from -lodgers, or supply information of a slanderous
kind to the dames they attend. It appears the
manager is experienced. He has known unfair
boarders pump the maids for news of the cat next-
door—to elicit an account of her visitors, her
manner of entertaining, and even the number of
linen under-garments sent each Saturday to the
laundry. For a trifle (the sex being a poor tipper)
the Hebe has told all, and, in order to be sensa-
tional and interesting, invented a few tarradiddles
where the truth fell short of the shock that the
tipper expected for her shilling. This sort of thing
has led to hair-tearing scenes, and now the manager
threatens the Suzettefcin his employ with instant
dismissal for the faintest infringement of the
“ Bear no Tales ” rule.
The wool-buyer is a factor in Melbourne at pre-
sent, when he is back from the sale-rooms and
out of his big linen pinny. The arrival of this
migratory bird of commerce, who comes here
mainly because the Australian man hasn’t sense
enough to spin the wool that the Australian sheep
has sense enough to grow, causes a small sensation
in several quarters. He is generally a bachelor, a
killer and a most heartless humbug, so the local
girl makes a pet of him. Sometimes he is English
and quite jolly. Other times he is an excited,
bristling Frenehie. Most often he is German-
branded. This year the whole drove of them rush
the merino nap after the Cup. Then they hie,
with a lot of cry and a little sample wool, to Har-
borville for awhile, and Melbourne girleens sigh
heavily at their going.
Rooster-feather stoles are the thing this capri-
cious weather. Over a pneumonia yoke the boa
of fowl-tails is a good thing, and feels lots warmer
than it looks.
The lot of the dramatic eo.’s back number is a
sadly chequered one. One of her sits patiently on
the Williamson door-mat as soon as she learns of
a coming Marcus Superbus show. And, princi-
pally because she knows the range of grease-
sticks, she gets in. When the curtain falls on the
season’s last strut, she drifts back to obscurity.
Brisk competition goes on in the private hos-
pitals between convalescents when they reach the
stage of being conveyed to the balcony. The
competition is not only in the style of the negli-
gent (?) garb, but also in the number of callers, of
floral gifts, and of attentions received. One
appendicitis case has a silk embroidered dressing-
gown. T’other only a cheaply effective kimona.
That is cause for the yellow eye. One has her
wrapper threaded with bebe ribbons. T’other
has no giddy etceteras. More jealousy. One
receives a dozen vegetable trophies. T’other only
three lots. And so on. Doctor or nurses smile at
one more than another, so the other goes off her
gruel, and threatens a relapse. Now the Nightin-
gales have learnt to hate the convalescent period.
Miss Olive Godwin, as “The Country Girl,’’
earned special-extra applause on Derby night from
an audience that had mostly won on Lady Wallace,
and which rejoiced exceedingly in its good for-
tune. The fair mummer showed some consider-
able grace, and won the house by several songlets
of good quality. Several lesser girls earned pro-
motion at the rural show. Miss Wilson alone left
some room to spare in the ample swaddling-clothes
of Miss Celia Ghiloni’s dusky princess. Miss
Georgie Musgrove advanced from the silk team,
where she has long whirled a dainty foot, to strut
as the one stray aristocrat of the story. She
showed a sweet conversational voice and an easy
manner of dealing with stage space.
The fatted calf is being killed in sundry swagger

[ N.S.W. Cold Tea party has been so far
successful in its fight against the proposal that
\ two-thirds majority, should be required to
abolish the sale of drink in any district, that the
two-thirds has been reduced to three-fifths—6o
out of 100 votes instead of 66 and a fraction.
ne main contention of the apostles of temper-
ance is that a free people should not be shackled,
and that a simple majority should prevail. Yet
the jmrty includes several of the champions of the
an l- ederation days, who were enthusiastic in
nsisting that the Federal majority on that
occasion should be shackled with an 80,000
minimum. ’
Melbourne barrister Duffy played a smart
rick, the other day, on an alleged handwriting
Xpert. Unnoticed, he wrote two sentences, one
in a disguised hand, on a slip of paper. Then he
asked the expert to turn his head while two
brother sharks wrote a sentence each, on a sheet of
paper, Rut in place of handing this latter pro-
duction to the witness he passed over the docu-
ment he had penned himself. The “expert”
rashly pointed out various differences in the two
samples of Duffy’s writing, and wound up by de-
claring that one specimen proclaimed the writer a
£■? n ‘ 3 1 * mis t jolly, open-handed cuss, while the writer
°* the n ot ! l<;r was the e . xac t reverse. Then Duffy
showed that the specimens were both his own,
and the “expert” retired to ponder on the
treachery of lawyers.
From an Adelaide correspondent
Alex. M. Wilson, just dead in Adelaide, had an experi-
'v uc h is probably unique. The Commercial Bank
of S. A. smashed m 1886. It was a very bad smash, and
the manager a popular athlete and Y.M.O.A. man in the
city was gaoled with severity. Wilson was only
accountant but he, too, was placed on his trial. Appar-
ently bewildered, and perhaps thinking that he ought to
have foiled the manager’s schemes, he pleaded guilty,
and was sentenced. A second look into the matter made
it pretty clear that Wilson had not done anything crimi-
nal, and nearly every lawyer in Adelaide signed a petition
W ij asser ted that if he had defended himself he
couldn t possibly have been convicted. So the man who
had pleaded guilty to a crime that he hadn’t committed
was promptly released.
Specially fitted for the use of dyspeptics, invalids
and eonvatecenta, and valuable also as a light pabulum
for those in health, is “ Allenbury’s Diet”— not identical
with Allenbury’s Pood for Infants.” The new prepara-
tion is easily assimilated by even the most “touchy” of
stomachs, and is specially convenient in that the addition
of a little boiling water renders it ready for immediate
use at any time. *
fi S*' Reid is still in a quandary as to the
issue at the next elections. He recognises
that his old fiscal row is about dead—most of the
big softgoods people who used to prop up the
Foreign-trade cause are now partly in the manu-
facturing line themselves, and no longer care so
very much about Foreign-trade. If it comes they
will take it, and if it doesn’t come they will take
the other thing. The anti-Socialism cry didn’t
threaten to succeed when it was tried a few
months ago. All indications point to Reid falling
back on the old battler in his stable, sectarianism.
Every interview he gives to his faithful papers
nowadays drags in Cardinal Moran. The Cardinal
is a very small issue to fight an election on, but he
seems to be the only issue that Reid has.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It now transpires that N.S.W. Premier
Carruthers only expects to save £30,000 a year
(out of £522,000) by all the elaborate meannesses
and petty indignities which he has embodied in
his Old Age Pensions Amendment Bill.
Dr. T. A. Hynes, recently returned from
Japan, to an Adelaide ’Tiser interviewer :
There is no dubiety about the opinion of the merchants
and traders resident in Japan. They are almost unani-
mously anti-Japanese.
“ Puzzled ” : The Parliament of Australia
never settles down to business until it has cast an
entreaty at the ceiling to “prosper all our consul-
tations.” Somehow I can’t make this harmonise
with the frequent attempts to squelch “Tatter-
saH.”
Japan has resolved to out-do Britain in the
matter of battleships, and is starting to build ves-
sels stronger, batf-a-knot faster, and 4,000 tons
larger than anything Britain has at sea or under
construction. He is a hurried and ambitious
Monkey, and means business all the time.-
The Federal Parliament, at least, seems to
realise that its duty lies higher than inquiring why
Billjim or Algernon was summarily fired from
some job. It emphatically refused to let Crouch
appoint a Select Committee to probe 2id. worth of
alleged personal grievances re the Defence force.
Yic. Premier Bent is already going back
on his splendid financial record with a proposal to
borrow another £500,000. S.A. has just raised
£150,000 in an unobtrusive local way, and N.S.W.
expects to borrow about £1,500,000 this year. Also
Westralia has an anxious eye upon a possible mil-
lion or so.
Drs. Gutherie and Carrell, of Chicago
University, declare that experiments convince
them that presently surgeons will be in a position
to replace a worn-out human heart with a healthy
one from a living monkey. After the patient
recovers he will call loudly for unrestricted
Japanese immigration.
Moxham, M.L.A., wants a return supplied
to N.S.W. Parliament showing “the number of
persons belonging to each denomination in receipt
of old-age pensions.” If some one further de-
manded that the return should show how many
Foreign-traders, Protectionists. Revenue Tariff-
ists, Single-taxers, and Socialists were on the old-
age pension list, and how many pensioners
believed in Chinese labor, the document might
be interesting. Why always this howl about
religion ?
DON’T FORGET THE FLEET.
If the shock of war should come, the prayer going up
from our nation would be, “Give us another Nelson.”-
DEAKIN.
NELSON NO. 2 (as the shock of war appears in
sight): “ Just get these pots and pans out of
the road, and order up your navy, and I’ll
get to business at once.”
AUSTRALIA: “ Brandy! Quick!” (Collapses.)
Mr. McCulloch, the Melbourne politician,
has returned from ’Ome, and the Argus is de-
lighted with him because he is positive that demo-
cratic legislation has served to make Australia
disliked in the Cold Country. Hedeclares, however,
that in every instance the English misunderstand
and misinterpret the laws they object to. In these
circumstances it seems that it isn’t so much Aus-
tralian law as British thick-headedness that is at
fault, and what remedy have we for British thick-
headedness ?
Just now Crick, M.L.A., is battling with
a charge of corruption in Sydney; Willis, ex-
M.L.A., is arguing points over a N.S.W. extra-
dition warrant in Natal; and Millard, M.L.A.,
has been found guilty of larceny. The Labor
party can at least say that none of these gentle-
men was ever in its ranks.
In Tasmania the seven M.’sL.C. who
voted for the Constitution Amendment Bill
represent 10,089 electors and the nine M.’sL.C.
who opposed it and caused it to be thrown out
represent only 7524. As a rule the dullest Con-
servative seems to represent the smallest con-
stituency every time.
N.S. Wales gained 26,147 in population
last year by excess of arrivals over departures.
This is another proof of the way Federation is
driving the people out of the country, &c., &c.
The Federal tariff meant a reduced tariff to most
of the States and they lost. It meant an increased
tariff to N.S.W., and N.S.W. gains.
In N.S.W. Assembly, Meehan, M.L.A.,
has asked Attorney-General Wade to note a ruling
by Martin, C.J.—“That, wherever it is a crime
to take, it is a crime to give ; they are reciprocal.”
And would he get the law moving in the direction
of those landed persons who were so generous to
land agents, etc. ? Mr. Wade replied evasively.
Westralia has bad luck with its Labor
leaders. First leader, Robert Hastie, has just
been badly beaten at the selection ballot, and
retires from politics. Second leader, Daglish, ran
the party on the rocks and then left it. Third
leader, Johnson, promptly lost his seat. The
next probable leader is P. J. Lynch, who may
possibly arrive when his party’s ill-luck is used up
and have a less stormy passage.
Marvellous is the mis-information inflicted
on the British public. A correspondent to London
Outlook, speaking with the cocksureness of omni-
science, tells the readers of that paper :
Home people seldom hear the voices or views of the bush.
The bushman is the really important oolonial, and cer-
tainly three-fifths of the toilers in the Canadian and Aust-
ralian bush are not hostile to Japanese or British-Indiana
(and are keen pro-preferential). The opposition comes
from professional politicians (all townsmen) backed by the
work-shy crowd.
G. H, Reid on the naval subsidy :
There was never a service more faithfully rendered and
less adequately repaid.
The Admiralty promised one first-class armored
and two second-class cruisers and four sloops
this was some three years ago. Up to date one
second-class cruiser has arrived, while the armored
cruiser sent out has been recalled. And there
were other breaches of faith —in fact, the only
faithful thing about the naval subsidy is the
regular payment Dy the Commonwealth.
Manchester Guardian says that “ since
Japan, under the new treaty, may fight for the
defence of Australia, she has additional grounds
for discomfort at Australia’s attitude” re alien
immigration restriction :
Thomas Plummer, English Vice-
Chancellor and Master of the Rolls
early in the nineteenth century, pro-
jected a sound Australian policy in
the matter of spirits. He recom-
mended the formation in Sydney of k a
distilling company to be controlled
by Government, and to have the sole
right of supplying the local market
with liquor. One clause in the pro-
ject ran :
That, as an encouragement to the prefer-
ence, of colonial spirit, the colonial Legisla-
ture might put a very heavy duty on all
spirits imported from Europe, and altoge-
ther prohibit those imported from America,
Plummer maintained that his project
would accomplish—
(l) The encouragement of the farmer by
supplying an additional and permanent
market for his grain.
(2) The prevention of scarcity. The
meaning of this was that the company
would be obliged to store a quantity of
grain at least equal to six months’ con-
sumption by the whole colony, and in the
event of a bad harvest the Government
could suspend distillation and use the
grain for food.
(3) The raising of revenue. He favored
an excise duty of 4s. or ss. a gallon, and
estimated a' consumption of 30,000 gals, a
year, giving a net revenue of £6OOO a year,
at a rating of 2 gals, a head for the then
population.
“ It is significant that, hardly is
the ink dry on the new instrument,
the Anglo-Japanese alliance, before
Japan is asking the Commonwealth to
reconsider its policy.” —Wellington (M.L.) Post.
“ G.” writes :
I note in last issue someone called Henry Lee ques-
tioning the allegations about the Barren Plains land,
mentioned in “Looking for Land” (B. Oct. sth)—the
awful place where Bent proposes to put immigrants. Mr.
Lee is right, in one way, in saying there are two plains,
but one is a continuation of the other, and they are both
of exactly the same nature —barren, water-logged in
parts, and destitute of grass. It is on the western side of
the area that Bent had his eye. Yesterday I met a friend
who was born near the plains, and asked him about the
land. “ Worse than horrible,” he called it.
The city of Brisbane with its suburbs
occupies 305 square miles. Sydney occupies 127 ;
Melbourne 255 ; Adelaide 262. Those sore-headed
parochialists who profess that 100 square miles —
less than half the area .of Adelaide —are sufficient
for a Federal capital, with its suburbs, its water
catchment area, its reservoir and its sewage
outlet, are invited to consider these figures and
admit that thistles are their most fitting diet.
Even the proposed 900 square miles are insuffi-
cient, and 5000 would be much more like a fair
thing.
The Select Committee appointed by
N.S.W. Assembly to report on the subject of Aus-
tralian-made goods sold locally as foreign, has
started on boots. The evidence so far shows the
effects of the working of the Commonwealth
tariff, which protects footwear to a certain extent.
One local manufacturer swore that since the semi-
protective tariff was imposed imports had de-
creased 75 per cent., and that better boots were
sold than formerly. (This man had made three
extensions to his factory under the new tariff.)
Another stated that boots were cheaper to-day in
N.S.W. than ever before, and also better. A
warehouseman deposed that Australian boots and
shoes, aided by a little Protection, had beaten
American boots clean out of the market except for
fancy and special lines, and that in most classes
the local ones were cheaper. And what Protec-
tion has done for the boot trade it could do for
other Australian industries, if it had the chance.
The next inquiry in N.S. Wales should be
with regard to the Mines Department. The finan-
cial advantages to be got by “ pull (if there were
any pulling) in the Mines Department would even
outweigh the profits of an improvement lease.
And it is said that one famous land agent could
get what he liked in the way of suspensions of
labor conditions and so on.
THE ENEMY WITHIN THE GATES.
The Manchester Guardian, speaking of the Australian Immigration Restrction Act, an a: “ Since Japan,
under the new treaty, may fight for Australia, she has additional groun's for discont nt at Austral as
attitude.” — CABLE.
THE JAP : “ Why preserve that unfriendly attitude I Can't you see I've come to fight for Australia?"
AUSTRALIA : “ Sorry my attitude don't suit; but I have a foolish, haunting kind of an im-
pression that when you fight for Australia it will be greatly to my advantage to have
you, at arm's length."
The Tasmanian Assembly has just thrown
out Dr. M ‘Call’s Bill for the abolition of Party
Government, and the Council has thrown out the
Constitution Amendment Bill and the Local
Option Bill. A few other things have also been
thrown out, but the Tasmanian Parliament
throws out almost everything, and it is impossible
to keep count of its doings. It generally finishes
by throwing out its chest, and throwing out
nasty insinuations about the Australian Parlia-
ment.
Prime Minister Deakin has stated in the
House of Reps, that
corporeal .punishment is no longer administered in the
navy, but youths under the age of 18 are caned for grave
breaches of discipline.
What a precious possession is a mind which can
distinguish between “ corporeal punishment ” and
“caning ” ; and can ignore, at the same time, the
fact that this “ caning ” —on the bare, trussed-up
body with a birch bunch—is an utterly brutal
thing, as bad as any gaol flogging !
Brisbane Daily Mail says there js no
need at all for the Morgan Government’s Bill
providing for the compulsory maintenance of
Brisbane Hospitals; though private charity let
them go practically bankrupt, it says that private
charityis quite equal to their support. Toprovethis
it has started a fund, subscriptions to be returned
to the donors if the Bill passes. The Bill is pretty
sure to pass, so many a man who would probably
decline to actually give 6d. is expected to come
down handsomely in the blessed assurance that
his cheque will be returned to him. The Mail
itself gives £5O (to be returned to it if the Bill
passes). Also Digby Denham, Minister for Public
Works, sends a subscription to help advertise the
paper that is toiling to burst up the Government
of which he is a member.
The big, blundering, roaring John Forrest
• did a whoop of joy in the House of Reps, over the
defeat of the Labor party in the Westralian State
elections. It is only a month or two since Bigjohn
eagerly grabbed at office in a Federal Ministry
which lives on its alliance with the Labor party,
and when he openly reveals his hatred of the party
in this fashion he simply brands himself as a politi-
cally unprincipled and bellowing person who has
again sold himself for office. He hasn’t the excuse
of being in need of the salary which goes with
office, for he is rich. Nor has he the excuse that
he has a policy to which he is passionately
attached, and that he is willing to swallow
many things for the sake of getting a chance to
carry it out, for he has no policy. He merely
poses as a large, foolish, incapable, ostentatious
bagman sort of individual, who wants office for
the sake of the excuse it gives him for an extra
sticking of gold lace on his corporation, and who
lacks even the sense to disguise his unfortunate
position.
“ 11. R.” (Charters Towers) writes :
The Bulletin (12/10/’O5) rightly ascribes the defeat of
Labor at Charters Towers bye-election to want of con-
fidence in the “Socialism in our time” section of the
Labor party, headed by Lesina. The advent of that
individual here ensured the downfall of the Labor
nominee. I regret—having worked hard to assist in the
formation of the Labor party inN.S.W., some 15 years ago
—being forced to admit that the party has apparently out-
lived its usefulness. We Australian workmen don’t want
to be continually depending on relief works to absorb the
unemployed. Since the advent of the Labor party I have
worked in Canada and U.S.A., and returned to smell the
wattle blossom, quite convinced, notwithstanding the
opinion of Holman, M.L.A., to the contrary—that Aus-
tralian workmen can, with half a chance, stand in line
with the world’s best. Consequently —with Holman,
M.L.A.— I think that it is up to The Bulletin to state
definitely whether it is for the Labor party or not;
whether it is for a party that protects the cheap labor of
other countries by giving their cheap-made products
almost free admission into the profitable markets of this
Commonwealth, whilst causing local employers to pay
high wages, work short hours, etc.; or will it. instead
start right in now and barrack for the formation of a
High Protection Democratic Party ?
The Bulletin has started in that direction; and
will try to make some dust fly as it goes.
Elicited in reply to a question m Parlia-
ment that the Boomerang and Karrakatta, which
were “protecting” Australia against armed inva-
sion as part of the £200,000 squadron, a year ago,
have just been sold in England for £l9ooand £1875
respectively. It really looks as if Australia
could have bought the whole blessed Australian
Scrap-iron Squadron for about the amount it con-
tributes to its support in six months. Probably if
Deakin were to make a sporting offer of £200,000
for the lot, including those which are now making
their way out here as fast as break-downs will
permit, he would be rushed.
The chance of passing a useful piece of
legislation is promised to Vic. Assembly by Car-
lisle and Bowser, M’s.L.A. The Bill they frame
forbi:ls women to be employed for the sale of
wine in wineshops, or to loiter or remain on the
premises. Penalties from £5 for first offence to
forfeiture of license for a third within three years.
There are exemptions for female dependants and
domestic servants. Melbourne wineshops are for
the most part unsavory places, and many of them
m ake no pretence to be anything else.
Premier Carruthers says that the following
are typical and quite ordinary cases in theN.S.W.
Old Age Pensions branch :
One claimant had a son in a good professional position
in Sydney, a son a solicitor, a son doing well in Tasmania,
and'sons in the civil service of the State earning respec-
tively £450, £2OO and £l5O per annum. Another claimant
had a son who paid in wages alone £32 weekly. A
widower, another claimant, had sons earning £Bl6 yearly,
two having quarters in addition, both being civil servants
with an income of £225 and £260 respectively. Another
claimant, a widow, had a son who was a popular actor
earning £l5 a week. Another widow, a claimant for a
pension, had a son earning £LOO a year, and a daughter
married to a man drawing £620 a year. Another widow
had a son earning £4OO per annum. Other instances
were ; —Widow, son earning £4OO a year, son a solicitor,
sons earning ih all over £l5OO a year ; a widow, two sons
in the Government service, earning £660 a year ; father
and mother, two sons and two daughters in the Education
Department, earning respectively £228, £lBO, £l3O, and
£125 per annum. Mr. Carruthers said he knew of other
cases which, if exposed, would horrify the public.
Yet, with all this, Carruthers doesn’t propose to
make these allegedly affluent sons and daughters
support their parents, now on the Old Age
Pensions list. He only proposes to make a public
exhibition of the old parents by compelling them
to apply for their pensions in open court before a
gaping crowd, on the off-chance that the sons will
feel hurt and pay up.
Launceston (Tas.) Examiner spoke the
other day about its lamentable island—Tory-
governed, ridden by great land-monopolies, with
a diminishing population, decaying agriculture,
and the biggest unproductive debt burden per head
on earth—in this fashion :
No sane individual, if he owned the island, would lay
out more capital until he got a better return from that
which he had already spent. It is not so much the open-
ing of fresh areas as the proper utilisation of those already
opened up which is required. The Closer Settlement
Acts of Maoriland are acknowledged to be one of the
prime factors in its development, and up to the present
the State has not lost anything worth speaking of
through tenants not meeting their engagements. . . .
We have a Closer Settlement Act on our statute book,
but it is a dead letter. It is imperfect, since it does not
provide for compulsory purchase ; but no active effort
has been made to make use of it with regard to voluntary
purchase. There was a half-hearted attempt. buy pro-
perty which was already fairly settled, and when that
collapsed the whole thing fell to the ground. . . .
Farms have been bought up by the larger landowners.
There has been steady accumulation in this direction, we
need not go far from Launceston to find this. There
certain large landowners have been steadily adding acre
to acre and farm to farm, and the land which is going out
of cultivation in these localities balances the new areas
brought under the plough in other directions ; hence we
are making little or no progress.
The same paper, the same week, reckoned that it
was the Sydney Trades Council which scared away
Booth’s immigrants. If it did, Tasmania is the last
place which has any right to complain. It has
scared away immigrants almost continuously for 4u
years, and now it is successfully scaring away its
own population.

Rheumatism.
Confined to Her Bed and Unable to Lift
Hand or Foot Without Excruciating
Pain. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
Give Almost Immediate Relief.
“Six years ago, while residing at Wyong,”
writes Mrs. Elizabeth Levett, of Liverpool,
N.S.W., “I contracted rheumatism through
getting a severe chill from exposure to heavy ram,
and was confined to my bed for some considerable
time. I could not lift a hand to my head or move
a joint. The slightest movement would cause
agonising pain. In the legs and feet especially
the pain was excruciating, and I would scream out
if I moved an inch. A friend of mine, a Mrs.
Chapman, one day recommended Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, as she knew a man who had
suffered for nine years, and was cured by them.
As I had wasted pounds in trying to obtain relief,
but without avail, I determined to follow her
advice, and procured a bottle as a trial. I had
not finished it when I felt easier and the inflamma-
tion seemed to subside. At the same time my
appetite increased, and with continued treatment
at the end of a few months I was able to get about
again, and I began to pick up in condition, recover-
ing rapidly the suppleness of limb. When the
weather threatens a renewal of the old symptoms
I have recourse to the old remedy ; in fact, I would
not be without them in the house. I recommend
them to all my friends, and I firmly believe them
to be a first class remedy for all ailments arising
from derangement of the system. I have much
pleasure in making this statement, hoping my
experience may benefit others.” Those who suffer
from any form of rheumatism, sc.atica,
or neuralgia should use Comstock s Nerve and
Bone Liniment, in conjunction with Dr. Morses
Indian Root Pills. These two remedies have been
highly successful in all kinds of rheumatism, be-
cause one cleanses the blood of all poisonous
substances that cause the disease, increasing the
activity of the blood-making glands, while the
powerful, penetrating influences of the liniment
acting through the pores of the skin on the nerves,
bones and muscles overcome the pain by relieving
the "effect on the delicate nerves, causing the
circulation of the blood to be maintained through
the affected parts. Rheumatism, lumbago, and
sciatica all yield to the powerful, penetrating, and
conquering properties of Comstock’s Nerve and
Bone Liniment if used in conjunction with Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills. Obtainable at all
chemists and stores, or post free on receipt of P^|p e
(Pills Is. lid., 6 bottles 6s. 6d. ; Liniment 2s. 6d.,
6 bottles 13s. 6d.), from W. H. Comstock Go.,

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Just as The Bulletin goes to press, word comes
that Blue Spec has won the Melbourne Cup, with Scot
Free and Tartan second and third. Blue Spec is a six-
year brown horse, owned by P. A. Connelly. He carried
Bst. in the big race, and was trained by W. S. Hicken-
botham. As a 4-year-old he won twice and ran second
once, at Boulder and Kalgoorlie. At five years he won
Kalgoorlie Spring Stakes, the Kalgoorlie Cup, and,
finally, the Perth Cup, a two-mile spin, carrying 9st. 21b.
in 3min. 35sec. The record for that race was 3min.
33 4-ssec., and Blue Spec’s time was the next best.
* * * *
The victory of Lady Wallace in the V.It.C.
Derby should have been received with a great burst of
sporting approbation, instead of a little mild applause
from the filly’s backers. It was not a fine performance,
to be sure, for the race has often been won more easily in
better time. But it was a vindication of form. Lady
Wallace, both at Randwick and Caulfield, had shown her
heels to the best of a bad lot of Australian three-year-olds,
and she re-asserted her superiority in the Derby. More-
over, it was quite in accordance with the fitness of
things for Grama to follow the winner. Grama was
the best of the Australians in the Spring Maiden Stakes
at Randwick when Isolt made hacks of the opposition.
With the Maorilanders—Noctuiform, Sun God and Isolt—
put out of the way, Lady Wallace and Grama would have
been the boss three-year-olds of last A.J.C. meeting, and
this time Mr. Stead’s horses were out of the way. No
need to insist further upon the vast difference between
the class of racehorses from over the sea and the mere
nags that represent Australia this season. Noctuiform
would be backed to give at least 211bs. to Lady Wallace.
* * * *
The going at Flemington must have been fairly
heavy on Derby Day. The times for the various races
ranged from isec. to ssec. slower than last year—a point
to be carefully noted should summer weather set in dur-
ing the week. Last year, for instance, Elvo won the
Hothain Handicap in 2.35.1, whereas this year the clock
showed 2.40|. Tartan took 2.9 J in winning Melbourne
Stakes ; Gladsome did it in 2.7% twelve months ago.
* . * * *
Debenture, a difficult horse to get into nick,
won the Coburg Stakes rather impressively. Punters
have tired of backing the much-beaten Debenture, but
there was a time long ago when this son of Water Lily
(bred by the late W. R. Wilson) had a lot of followers,
who expected him to do big things.
The public fancy for Aurate in the Hotham
Handicap last Saturday was not inspired by the stable.
Mr. David James, the owner, told many people that
Aurate’s preparation had not been accurately timed, and
his appearance after the race suggested that he wouldn’t
be quite ready for the 2-mile journey on Tuesday. Aurate
should win a race presently. He may pull off a handicap
on Saturday, or reward his patient followers in the
Williamstown Cup. A burly powerful 5-year-old, the
Bill of Portland-Auraria horse is perhaps a little more
forward in condition than he looks.
The secret of successful punting on Derby Day
lay in a devoted clannishness. One had to be a loyal
Scotsman, and back Lady Wallace with Charles Stuart
for the classic race. Tartan for the Melbourne Stakes, and
True Scot for the Encourage Stakes. In the Melbourne
Cup, the parritchers had Tartan, Marvel Loch, Scotland
and Scot Free going for them, but there was ne’er a nag
for the Irish to swear by.

A Methodist parson—one Berother Fowler, of
Rutherglen (Vic.)—told a horrified congregation lately
that “they might appreciate the magnitude of the
gambling evil when told that £20,000,000 of Australian
capital is locked up in this vice, which is one of the
running sores of the Commonwealth to-day.” Now, what
does Berother Fowler mean by that statement? Wanted
full particulars of the twenty million pounds which are
locked up in a running sore !
* • * *
The coincidence tip was for a mare to win the
Melbourne Cup, seeing that, for the first time on record,
the treble event—Caulfield Cup, and V.R.O.
Derby—yielded to feminine persuasion.
The Vic. Methodist Synod showed some worldly
knowledge of how to meet the local difficulty re the sup-
pression of tote-shops when it passed a resolution last
week that “the police should be empowered to enter
without special warrant any place reasonably suspected
of being used for illegal betting.” Considering how many
officious acts by the police are unwarranted, nothing
could be more absurd in its way than the Force’s pre-
tended dread of straining the Law against the “reason-
ably suspected ” tote-shops where Constable XX. gets
his “ bit on.” For instance, what is to prevent the police
from making their way, “in the name of the Law,”
through the premises which serve as a barrier around the
Collingwood Tote? If one “bobby” can call upon a
bystander in the street to assist him in capturing a sus-
pected criminal, fifty of them simultaneously could call
upon the dwellers in the Tote vicinity to give them nega-
tive assistance in making a raid. If a criminal chased by
the police were to bolt into Premier Bent’s private house,
they would invade the premises without waiting for a
warrant.

Deceased stallion Trenton, who made his mark
on the turf and at the stud, had four owners in Maoriland
before he was taken to Victoria for the Melbourne Cup.
He won the Auckland Welcome Stakes for Colonel Fraser,
the Midsummer Stakes fd* W. Somerville. He was next
purchased by G. G. Stead, who secured the C.J.C. Cham-
pagne Stakes with the son of Musket, and then sold him
to Dan O’Brien for 850 guineas. Dan always reckoned
Trenton was unlucky in losing Sheet Anchor’s Cup, in
which he finished third, just behind Grace Darling.
* * * *
The most remarkable incident in the racing
career of Trenton (deceased) was his defeat for the Mel-
bourne Cup twenty years ago, when he came only third,
in a tight finish, to Sheet Anchor and Grace Darling, the
three horses carrying 7.11, 7.12, and7.l3 respectively. In
a w.f.a. race among the three of them, with no other
competitors to jostle them, it would have been 10 to 1 on
Trenton every time. Next year, when he was some-
what infirm and very short of condition, Trenton carried
9.9 second to the light-weighted Arsenal. Yet he had
missed it when he was “thrown in” with 7.12. The
showy, commanding Maniopoto is a reminder of the
famous Maoriland horse of yore.

In answer to “Cav. Empt.” : Every man who
offers to sell for £1 or even £lOO an almost infallible sys-
tem of winning money from the betting ring is a glaring-
liar. If he had such a system he would keep it and win
the money himself. The “books” have only a certain
amount of'money, and he might as well have it as give it
to you. When a man offers you for £1 a certainty of
making, say, £lOO he is making you a present of £99. The
best thing in such a case is to tell him that you’ll take
£49 cash, and the £1 you didn’t send him will make £so,'
and he can keep the other £5O for his kindness.
This is the month of the wheel and the motor.
At Sydney Cricket Ground the Leaguers are on the whiz,
and sensational races and hairbreadth escapes are the
order of the day. On the 14tli of the month £16,990
worth of cars and motor bikes will start, from Melbourne
in the big Dunlop Motor Reliability Test. Saturday last
saw £75,000 worth of motor boats and yachts skimming
over the waters of Port Jackson. Verily, the whirr of
the motor is loud and expensive in the land. _____
Night cycling started at Sydney Cricket Ground
Wednesday night week, and continued on Saturday
evening. The Australian riders showed startling form.
MacFarland remarked about a fortnight ago that there
would be considerable haste over the Wheel race, and
that he hoped to be right there. On Saturday night,
Pye, Walker, and others made such haste that the long
Yankee had to retire from a hopeless contest. So far, the
most remarkable feature of the carnival has been the
upheaval of Pye. On the first night he heat Floyd
MacFarland in the Five-miles scratch. On Saturday
night he won his heats in the Wheel race and the Orient
Plate, and then came out in the Five-miles scratch and.
beat MacFarland, R. Arnst, and all the rest, and burst
the world’s record to boot. It was a wondrous race.
Brook, of Goulburn, came with a tremendous burst of
speed, and looked as though he had got clear away.
It cost the field six laps of desperate riding to over-
take him. At the end of a dozen laps the pace was
tremendous, half a dozen were trying for a break,
but the field was not going to allow anyone else to
get away ; and they reeled round the track, a confused
blurr of color. With two laps to go, right in front
of the ladies’ stand, there was a sudden cry and a crash;
and a confused heap of men and bicycles went rolling over
and over. The machines broke up like bottles, and the
riders sprang to their feet and struggled out of the way of
the second batch that came roaring past them. Plunkett
was in front, followed by Dick Arnst, Pye, and MacFar-
land. At the scoring-board the red jersey of Pye dashed
to the front and left the bunch. The bunch jumped and
drew level, but again the red went on and left. At the
members’ stand they were all together, only inches
separating them, and MacFarland was leaping along like
a rubber-tyred kangaroo. Another effort, and again the
red jersey flashed out in front. The Yankee leaped, so
did Clarke ; but the red jersey streaked away, a couple of
yards to the good, and the American, exhausted, slipped
back into third place. The time, a world’s record, was
lOmin. 2 3-ssec.

Twenty-eight motor-cars and 10 auto-bikes have
entered for the big Dunlop Test, which starts from Mel-
bourne on the 14th of this month. The roads are reported
to be, at present, just infernal, but it is hoped that they
may harden before the eventful week happens along. In
Bent’s State, anyhow, the road is always bad, but
just now it is beyond human expression. Altogether,
there will be 70 odd people taking part in the contest,
as each car has to carry at least one passenger. All
repairs and adjustments have to he carried out in running
time, and the cars will be locked up immediately they
arrive at sectional stopping places. Although it is not a
race, class A cars have to average 16 miles an hour ; class
B, 18 miles an hour ; class C, 19 ; while the little motor-
bikes have to snort along at an average of 18f miles an hour.
The single cylinder, or class A cars will struggle for the
Robert Hurst trophy ; the B class, or medium-powered
cars, strive for the Dunlop Trophy; the heavy class C
cars will decide the ownership of the Baillieu Trophy,
while motor bikists will race for the Rand Cup. Then
there are gold medals and special prizes. The most
successful car all-round will receive the Dunlop Cup, the
beautiful phosphor-bronze figure of Fame in her winged
automobile, to hold for the ensuing 11 months. This
must be won twice to ensure absolute possession. The
Garland Cup, a twenty-five guinea trophy, will be won
outright by the successful car. *
Of the 28 cars entered, the great majority (no
less than 20) are owned bv Victorians. All 10 motor
bikes belong to Bent’s State. S. Australia has one repre-
sentative in each class of cars, while N.S.W. has only two
heavy cars and three mediums, or five altogether. Evi-
dently Victoria is ahead of the Cornstalk State in motor-
ing. The most expensive cars are George Hobbs’Mer-
cedes, Foster’s Talbot, and Liddell’s Panbard, all three
valued at £l5OO each. The lowest-priced is Warden’s
Oldsmobile, which is valued at £2OO. The highest-priced
motor bike is Brandv-man Joshua's twin-cylinder Griffon,
which runs up to £75, spot cash. The lowest is B. James’
Minerva, worth £4O, and this writer guesses the little
Minerva will not be far out of it at the end, for the same
James is a daring and skilful rider, and a man who can
make the machine do anything in reason but talk.
* * * *
There were some humorous incidents in the last
test, which started from Sydney and ended in Melbourne.
On one section of the road the devil entered into a num-
ber of the competitors, and they swore to pass Stevens in
his great roaring Darracq or blow up. So they opened
out and went for their lives. Stevens rushed on in front,
and the snorting cars seemed to be unable to gain on
him. One enthusiastic sport stood up and started to
heave cargo overboard. A case of lager went first, half-
a-dozen spare tyres followed, soda syphons, tins of petrol,
and everything that was movable, completed the lighten-
ing, and the car slowly crept up on the big Darracq.
Other competitors also began to jettison, but one frugal-
minded racer slowed down and carefully loaded up his
car with all that the others threw overboard. It put him
out of the race, and he arrived at Wagga several hours
behind time, but he had the better of the dis-
pirited sports who had cast their substance away and
failed to overtake Stevens after all. #
Sydney’s Alfred Yacht Club held its first race
on Saturday under perfect weather conditions. The
westerly breeze was not sufficiently strong to make the
affair at all exciting. The prize was the Jackson trophy,
which had been twice won by J. A. Muston of the Janet.
Eight started with an ebb tide, and with the exception
that Culwulla passed Sunbeam, the yachts ballooned
away to Manly like a procession. After rounding they
lost' the temperate order of their progress. Some were
hung up in a calm, others jibed badly and had trouble
with their canvas, and at Shark Island they were closer
together, Janet slowly working towards the lead. Round-
ing Fort Denison Janet was third. Kukuburra and Cooya
were leading, but the boat that is called after the hilarious
bird was being steadily overhauled. Rounding Clarke
Island the Janet went to the front and won easily, with
Cooya second, and Kukuburra, which had led so long,
third. Mr. Muston will now retain the trophy per-
manently.
* * * *
Sydney Sailing Club had a couple of resurrec-
tions and a pair of new boats (Zena and Tasman) in
Saturday’s race. The perfect weather brought along
a record entry of 14. The new boat Zena came into pro-
minence by displacing the limit boat Alert at the front
of the fleet early in the race. On a dead thresh from
Shark Island Zena, Arawa, Crescent, and Federal tried
every trick and ruse of the game to get away from one
another, and the contest was keen. Federal ran on and
put Arawa about at 400 yards from the finish. Crescent
and Zena were struggling away to the lee when the wind
veered round to the west, and the lee boats tacked, while
the Arawa, which had been forced to \yindward,
came with a rush and crossed the line an easy first.
Crescent took second place, arid Zena managed to
beat Federal for the third position. Federal had sailed
a great race, and experienced hard luck at the finish.
But the spectacle of spectacles on Saturday was
the opening demonstration of the Pioneer Motor-Boat
Club. A blue sky, a gentle breeze, green, flashing water,
and floods of sunshine between. The motor-boats darted
and skimmed as they assembled in Farm Cove, all flags
and streamers. Some of them were like floating gardens,
being decorated with Union Jacks, with yards of bright
ribbons flying in streamers, also with pot flowers, palms
and wreaths. They were the “ cruisers.” The majority of
those present were of that type. Then there was the
beautiful Cyrenia—a long, bright cedar skiff, with dots of
polished brass marking its length, looking like an over-
grown Rob Roy canoe, and seated behind the driver three
beautiful girls with bright parasols. They looked like
a floating rose-bush. Another craft of the same sort con-
tained a young couple sitting side by side, she holding a
pale-pink parasol over them both. They streamed away
towards Chowder, and it was as though the flower-beds
had broken away from Palace Garden and were drifting
towards the open sea. The prize for the best-
decorated yacht was won by Mr. E. A. Laurence
with the Mistral. Off Chowder Head the procession
was in open order, lilting along dead slow, and great,
white-winged yachts, covered with scornful faces, came
swooping and dipping, running through the motor fleet.
Then into Chowder Bay, where it was found that the
water was too crowded to admit of races or tugs of war,
so the afternoon was spent in speeches and ref^® shme "* s -
It was a lovely spectacle. The sport will happen along
shortly. *

E. F. Waddy will be the first clergyman to
represent N.S.W. in inter-State cricket.
“ Country Week ” was a period of unmitigated
disaster to the bush cricketers, their only gleam of hope
being Hunter River district’s stand against Waverley.
The Hunter River men scored a draw through the splen-
did play of the not-out men, Leon Moore and I*. Home,
who smacked up 222 and 103 before they closed their
innings with six wickets down for 451. For a littlewhile
it w-as hoped that the stand made by N. Hives for Dubbo
against Re lfern would stem the tide, but his 101 only
served to i ;e a trifle off the edge of Redfern’s victory,
which was jv 297 runs on the first innings. It was a day
of downfall. 'On the other hand the townsmen smacked up
centuries galore. Alphabetical White of North Sydney
topped the score with 218, L. Pye of Central Cumberland
Icame close on his heels with 213, and J. Barnes of
Redfern third with 192. Altogether 15 metropolitans
reached three figures; and the bowling figures are
absolutely indecent. Altogether, the thing was an
appalling and wearisome walk-over.
Warner is taking a team to South Africa this
Christmas, more than half “ amateur.” Fane and Thomp-
son, of the team he brought to Maoriland, are in it, and
Relf of his last Australian team ; also Denton and Haigh,
the Yorkshiremen. '
* * * *
A few of the Sydney first-grade cricketers are
making an early bid for the season’s batting records.
A. B. S. White’s figures in four matches are 31, 96, 196 not
out, and 218 —541 runs, average ISO'3 ; J. R. Mackay has
piled up 68, 204, 147 not out, and 121 retired—s4o runs,
average 270 ; L. W. Pve, 122 and 213—335 runs, average
167-5. Thus far, the smiting of centuries by cricketers
points to little glory for the bowlers, and much weariness
of the flesh for the fieldsmen.

Sedretary Bowden, of the N.S.W. Cricket
Association, has hit straight out from the shoulder and
planked the overbearing Marylebone Cricket Club and the
bounceful Melbourne ditto into the exact position a
benign Providence intended them to occupy. Marylebone
Cricket Club has been, according to the skipper of the
discredited XI., ski ting about not recognising the
Australian Board of Control. Bowden has told
Marylebone that it can send what teams it likes,
but they will not play in N.S.W. or anywhere
else against the N.S.W. cricketers unless they
come out under agreement with the Board of Control.
Secretary Bowden is evidently the right man in the right
place. The next we shall hear will be that the bumptious
Marylebone crowd has climbed down, or decided to keep
its cricketers in England.

Cricketer Syd. Gregory, in his bankruptcy
examination, was carelessly vague as to the cash return
of the reeent Australian tour. He thought it- might be
about £BOO per man less expenses, and he believed it was
somewhere about the same as previous trips. Someone,
Bill Howell if he remembered rightly, told him there was
something still owing to him —£15 perhaps, or there-
abouts. Any way, someone was to pay him something.
He had sent a few hundreds home to his people—
£2oo or £3OO, or perhaps. it might be more. All
of which gave the impression that the members
of the returned syndicate were very indifferent
to the financial side of the tour, and were
liable to leave their share of the profits on the
hotel verandah and forget all about it when they
went to bed. It is vaguely suggestive of the barrister
with the flap at the back of his gown—a survival of the
pocket in which his client was once supposed to put his
fee, unknown to him, while he was furiously conducting
the case for sheer love of justice. He never knew he had
been paid anything till he sat down exhausted on top of
the money.
* * * *
Although George Giffen has retired from S. Aus-
tralian cricket as far as inter-State fixtures are concerned,
old “ Jack ” Reedman remains there. The veteran’s good
form with both bat and ball in club cricket keeps him in
his position, and as the young players’ cricket is as patchy
as the spots on the pard, the old man cannot be shifted.
* * * *
Lawn tennis is a very sick game in New South
Wales, and the Cornstalk Association has had to abandon
its inter-State tournament with Victoria, which was fixed
for the 18tli of this month, for sheer lack of players who
can make the trip. Truth to tell, lawn tennis only
flourishes where there are insufficient people to support a
cricket team or a crowd of hurlers.
* * * *
The sculling match between Ford and Arthur
Towns, at Raymond Terrace on Saturday, is as sure as
the final deposit and a reasonable anioUnt of wagering can
make it. The difference in the weights amounts to only
21b. or 31b., and Ford has the advantage of about six
months’ longer experience on the planet. It would be
hard to imagine a more even match. Ford will row in a
beautiful boat made bv Chris. Neilson, while Towns will
struggle for fame and boodle in a superb skiff constructed
specially for the purpose by brother George. *
After all, it is doubtful if there is anything to
be wildly excited over in the success of the Maoriland
footballers in England. Rugby seems to be a rather dead
game in the Cold Country just now, the great mass of the
people being interested in Association only. Rugby, this
writer is credibly informed, is now played only by the
“ very naieest,” gentlemen who never stained their hands
with anything but ink, and many of them not even with
that; and that class of player has no show with the sturdy
cow-spankers from Maoriland. The hardy professionals are
now playing Association, and the high-toned Rugby clubs
bar the manual laborer, just as N.S.W. rowers did for
years, and the result, in an international aspect, is deplor-
able. Maorilanders are nearly all young men who have
toiled long hours in the open air.
* * • *
Cricket v. football in England. Final cricket
match, ending September 16th, champion county (York-
shire) v. Rest of England, “between 8000 and 9000 paid
gate in the three days.” Football, same date, an ordinary
League match between two Birmingham clubs. “The
gates opened at 1.45. By 2.30 there were over 25,000
persons present. Some time before the advertised time
for starting there must have been over 30,000, and it was
found necessary to close the entrances.”
N.S.W. Rugby Union is particularly anxious
that an English Rugby team should make an early visit
to Australia, and it is quite possible that a team may
come in 1907. The Metropolitan Union (which controls
competition football in Sydney) doesn’t desire such a visit
because it will “interfere with club football” ; but the
head bodv will most likely have its own way.
* * * •
Maoriland Rugby football team, up to the begin-
ning of this week, had played 15 matches in the Gold
Land, and had scored 492 points (113 tries and 69 goals)
against 15 (2 tries 3 goals). The wildest barracker of the
team (even King Seddon) didn’t anticipate so much. The
attendances have been good, and the M.L. Unions, which
partly financed the tour by taking debentures, are shaking
hands with themselves and each other and their best girl.
* * * *
The Rugby Football Union has, through
its Parliamentary friends, started an agitation to
secure representation on the Sydney cricket ground
committee. Events not yet forgotten make. some
excuse for their contention, but it is difficult
to see how, if the footballers are to have a
say in the ground management, the cyclists and other
bodies are to be refused. The solution lies in giving the
members of the ground a voice in the settling of affairs.
There is hardly another institution which asks for a £5 ss.
entrance fee and a £2 2s. subscription that absolutely de.
nies its members the smallest say in its management _
Had the subscribing members a vote, the Rugby foot-
ballers would be safe in trusting that any future season
would not see the cricket ground barred from them except
on monopolistic terms.
* * * •
Australasian Athletic Championships’ meeting
happens at Sydney this coming Saturday and Monday,
and sprinters and junipers and other Olympic performers
are all wending that way. The last of the Victorians arrived
on Tuesday last, the Tasmanians, Bananalanders, and
the Maoriland contingent were due on Wednesday niorn-
in°\ Before embarking at Wellington, the Maoriland
crowd gave the windy city a taste of their ability, and
Burk showed he was not a safe landing place for beetles
bv gettingover the mile in 4min. 35sec., and doing other
remarkable things. Altogether, this meeting promises to
be a huge success, and some new Australian figures are
likely to be created.
* * * *
Possible that the Australasian Amateur Athletic
Association will be represented at the Olympian Games
at Rome in 1908—at least, the machinery is being oiled
up as regards support for such a proposal.
Australian golfers have evidently a lot to learn
before they can hope to hold their own at the ex-
asperating game on British links. At the recent champion-
ship meeting held in Melbourne, the three championships
went to three casual English golfers who happened to oe
there. Golf is not yet one of the great natural resources
of this country.
* * * *
A proclamation under the N.S.W. Birds Protec-
tion Act which applies to all birds, native or foreign, notifies
that the close season—l st July to 31st January is extended
to “ pigeons (except wonga) and doves of every species.
From which it would appear that a prosecution will lie
against all pigeon slayers who attend at the gun club
shambles, throughout the spring and summer months.
* * * *
British racing and cricket gossip in the Aus-
tralasian continues to be headed “ Sporting News from
Home,” as though the present readers of the paper were
imported “ colonists ” like their forefathers. The tone of
the Australasian will remain forefatherly to the end.
* * * *
An appropriately-named filly now racing in
Maoriland is Petticoat, by Multiform out of Bloomer.
Bloomer’s prospective colt by Multiform is to be cal lea
Trousers. Trousers’ get will probably be named Willie s
Waistcoat, which is the last use ofmost trousers.
Annette Kellermann threatens to boom in Yankee-
land. ’Frisco Call devotes a page to her in a recent
Sunday supplement, giving a full-length portrait, 10
inches high, of the lightly-clad damsel, two columns inter-
view from London, and a scare headline, the width of the
paper, “ Australian Girl the World’s Greatest Swimmer.
In the interview, Annette tells that her mother, usually
regarded as French, is an American, and throws out a
challenge to swim any male Yank over 10 miles or more.
“ Men are better over short distances, which means mere
brute strength,” said Annette, “ but for long distances
women will always beat them. They have more patience.
* • * *
The Richard K. Fox medal, for the lightweight
champion, which the famous, or notorious, owner of the
N.Y. Police Gazette presented recently to the Maoriland
Boxing Association, is just the sort of thing that would
emanate from a man who called his paper the Police
Gazette. It is nearly six inches long, suspended by gold
link chains from three swingle-trees or cross-bars. The
bauble itself is a circular plate of gold, faced with blue
enamel. In the centre is a bust of Richard K. Fox, with
the eagle of his country over his noble top-knot; the
burrd being of gold, with outstretched wings. Fox is
apparently a man who hankers after publicity, and the
paper which travels on the picture of the high-heeled
maiden with skirts that reach barely to the knee,
apparently provides plenty of boodle wherewith to
indulge the craving.

The three following forecasts of weather
are typical illustrations of the absurdity of Mel-
bourne’s “ Observatory” Dept. : —
Victoria (Friday, 6 p.m.).—By Mr. Baracehi : Squally,
showery ; cold winds, veering from N.W. to S.W. ; blow-
ing fresh gales along the western coast, but probably
clearing up at occasional intervals, and improving later
to-morrow.
Victoria (Saturday, noon). —By Mr. Baracehi : Short
spell of cold, squally, showery weather during next 24
hours, with strong south-westerly to southerly winds ;
but soon improving, and becoming finer generally later
to-morrow.
Victoria (Monday, 6 p.m.).—By Mr. Baracehi : Cold,
squally, showery. Strong winds from between W. and S.,
blowing heavy gales in Strait, with rough weather and
high seas.
The prediction of Mr. Baracehi was falsified in
each of these instances. The barometer continued
to fall till the Government tipster gave up saying
it would rise. Then it rose. For the past six
months the uselessness, or worse than uselessness,
in a meteorological sense, of the Melbourne Obser-
vatory establishment has been remarked by every-
body who troubles to read its pronouncements.
Victoria wants value for its money from the
Meteorological Department, and all the trust-
worthy information obtained for £3000 a year is
preposterously dear at the price.
Octavius Burt, of Westralia, holds many
appointments, amongst them that of sheriff of
Perth, for which he gets £550 a year. He is also
head of the Prisons Department, and Chief
Electoral Officer. Likewise he is brother of
Septimus, formerly Attorney-General in the
Forrest Government, and another brother is a
goldfields warden. Just now Octavius is the most
heartily cursed man in Groperdom, it being com-
puted that 40,000 voters were disfranchised
through his department, and that the issue of
more t an a dozen elections was affected in
consi qu Mice. In some cases the rolls were cut
down oy oue-half on the ground that voters had
left the district, which they sometimes had, but
very often hadn’t.
Queensland will soon, according to all ap-
pearances, be “up against ” the railway problem.
Where railways are required, there are five
alternatives: —
(1) To let private companies build them (with or with-
out land grants), which is u' terlv and incurably nefarious.
(2) To build them by State loans, which is utterly
nefarious, but a shade better than No. 1.
(3) To build them with the proceeds of land sales, which
is nefarious, but a shade better than Nos. 1 and 2.
(4) To build them out of the proceeds of taxation, which
is far the best, but requires a lot of courage, especially in
a country where heavy taxation is required merely to pay
interest on the debt piled up through the drunken
extravagance of the past.
(5) To do without them for the present.
Queensland isn’t taking any of No. 5; it hasn’t
yet screwed up enough courage for No. 4; and
there already begins to be danger of the Morgan
Government barking its shins over Nos. 1, 2,
and 3.

The Manchester Guardian, lecturing
Australia on its selfishness and brutality in ex-
cluding colored persons, concludes : —
From the British point of view the disabilities of our
Indian subjects touch our self-respect even more closely
than the disabilities of an allied, but alien, nation.
Truly this is blastiferous impudence ! The Aus-
tralian only inflicts on the Indian the “ disability ”
of beeping him out of Australia. The Britisher
invades India, and inflicts on the Indian in his
own house all the disabilities of political serfdom.
When Britain gives the Indian a vote, and a local
Parliament or a place in a Federal Parliament of
the empire, when he gives him the same chance of
military promotion as a white man, when a white
woman can njarry him without losing caste and
her Eurasian offspring ceases £q be a despised
thing, and when the white man in India begins to
look on the Asiatic as something of an equal in
the Asiatic’s own country —then it will be time
enough to talk about the disabilities which the
Australian imposes on our “ colored fellow-
subject.”
In the Scotch Highland crofting counties
of Argyllshire, Inverness, Ross, Cromarty,
Sutherland and Caithness the land under deer-
forests has increased in this way during the past
18 years : —-
1886 .. 1,709,892 acres
1898 .. 2,510,625 „
1904 .. 2,920,097 „
What sort of a Scotchman, anyway, is it who
won’t help Australia to get a graduated land tax ?
The backbone of the country again, as
reyealed by the anti-Socialist Albury (N.S.W.)
Banner:—
Albury, it seems, is not the only town which has fallen
into arrears over its water-supply payments. Moama is
£1600 behindhand, not having paid anything at all for
several years. . . . Deniliquin has not paid one peppy
for the past five years, although the revenue from the
waterworks is more than sufficient to pay current
expenses, and something to the Government besides.
How would these anti-Socialists get on if they had
to pay for things ?
Victoria’s State pensioners now number
3164, and receive £335,480 annually. Of thes
3103, who draw £322,411, are local residents , the
other 61 live and spend their £13,069 abioad.
A cry from Louis Esson : —
I want to see cafes in Melbourne whither one may
adiourn to sit down peacefully, and talk, sl| ioke, drink,
and hear music-or for what the French call distrac-
tion ” The ordinary pub is deplorable. To stand up
Gainst an hgTy bar, swill beer rapidly, knock over
somebody’s pewter, and then dart to another saloon,
where this painful process is repeated, or to haunt some
private bar to admire the Maiden of the OsnieiflLocks
this may be an intellectual proceeding, but it is> nop
amusing'. And the club is perhaps worse. George
Moore has explained for all time how ideas are impossible
in a club, for a club must have a mahogany table, and
plush waiters, and severe restrictions against expressing
any opinion on anything more threatening than billiards
or horse-racing. In a Parisian cafb one may meet one s
friends and discuss the universe, but who ever heard the
universe mentioned in a public house? the cafe is a
pub without vulgarity and a club without con yen ti oil—-it
unites only the best qualities of both—and though it
may be un-English it could very well be made Australian.
And I want cates where coffee is always on tap and
cheap and good Average Melbourne coffee
than imported ale. Its usual!} • ff properly
brown slush or alleged coffee
made, is a beverage that . a stimulant for
noxious spirituous liquors. It s as o 1 ■ Eeer

Some Melbourne emporiums are inipioung, 11 !

of life would make for righteousness, and mu in t
eventuate if we intend to live in the bright Pagan spintoi
this country. However, a one-night attempt at P
cafd has been made on the St. Hilda pier, so, on the holt,
as the astronomer observes, it moves.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
d
MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining: membrane of the
nose and adjoining- passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
I sight and hearing, destroys
| the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try
our great remedy.

It is now about 18 months since the Chinese in-
vaded the Transvaal under an Imperial Act,
which provides that “no Chinese shall leave the
premises on which lie is employed without a
signed permit.” Immediately the Act had Been
approved, ex-coioiiial Governors out of a job,
Stock Exchange speculators, arid idle Busybodiefe
iridridated the English press With letters argulrig
that la'rgb Bridies of Asiatics Should be introduced
into tropical Australia under similar conditions.
Comparisons were freely drawn between the in-
telligence of the, Transvaal, with its scheme of
“ properly regulated ” indentured labor, and the
stupidity of Australia, with tropical land to
cultivate, held as a trust for the Empire,
and a prohibition policy for colored labor.
All this is history ; to-day it is possible to sum up
the results of the Act. About 47,000 Chinese have
been imported, and show a very natural objection
to being shut up in stockades. Large numbers of
them have broken loose, and are at large. The
police are powerless to arrest them, in spite of
organised “drives.” They raid the country,
murders are frequent, stores are looted, white
miners are afraid to go below without police pro-
tection ; soldiers are kept ready to march from
Pretoria at a moment’s notice ; the Government
has been obliged to authorise the whites to arm
themselves for defence ; and a reign of terror pre-
vails round Johannesburg. So much for the
benefit to the Transvaal. As an offset, London is
supposed to get better mining dividends; but
even that seems doubtful.

A tale of the sea
The vessel gave another lurch, and the man in the top
bunk grasped convulsively at the flask which contained
the last of his sodawater. “Would to Heaven this
wretched journey were overt" he moaned, after hastily
swallowing the contents. “O gimme death," The mail
in the top bunk felt that his cup of woe was very full, and
his measure of misery was only equalled by the elation of
the man in the bunk below, This individual revelled ill
the prospect of a good heavy sea, for had not the miser*
able man in the bunk above refused him the loan of a
mtgazine in which he knew that his first accepted article
was printed, and of which he had been just too late to
Secure a copy before embarking. “Revenge is sweet"
murmured the monster as he proceeded to enlighten his
fellow-traveller on the probable length of the journey-.
But there is a limit to all things, and—well, the man iil
the top bunk, would have soup for dinner, although he
had been advised not to. Then the man in the bottom
butik hastily withdrew from the cabin, with his boots
fcnd s maw other articles which he had been unwise
enough to scatter over the floor of the compartment.
“Times are changed,” said the venerable
bush solicitor, Spreading a red bandana over his
bald crown to keep off the flies: “ Wheii I was
Jrouiig in the prdfeSsidri the cdiirt, never left the
town without it spree: The Judges canie only

The Director & Principal of Institutes,
Mr. HOWARD FREEMAN.
ri IHE Melbourne Cup Season once more has passed, with all its varied attractions and its
seductive influences, fl lie man in the street was again greatly in evidence, and knew the
winner by intuition. The same great question was asked—“WHlCH HORSE WILL WIN?”
It is safe to assume that out of the thousands who attended the racecourse, and were interested
in the result of the great race, there was a fair percentage of lucky ones who scooped the financial
pool. There were thousands, however, who lost—perhaps many who HAD PAWNED THE
PROVERBIAL SHIRI? in order to win. These men were found “with downcast mien and
sullen face ” at the conclusion of the day’s race.
These are the inevitable happenings to this great event. And, after all, be the winnings great
or small, what are they compared to that great and glorious health which is at all times the admired
and the much sought after ? The man who is healthy is at all times the winner in the great race of
life. He is always the capable man ; but the man who is diseased is done.
We draw attention in this racing moment to tell all men, bettors or not, that they cannot do
better than consult us, for we are SPECIALISTS in DISEASES of the MALE SEX, and if any
man requires expert counsel upon any disease HE CAN RECEIVE IT FREE by calling or
writing to the Specialists of
The FREEMAN & WALLACE Medical Institute.
Horse-racing and the excitement accruing from it may be a good thing in its way, it is often of a healthy
character, where the constitution is healthy and strong, and robust enough to stand the strain, but where the
person is weak and sickly, it is dangerous. It is an excitement to be avoided. Par better for persons in this condi-
tion were they to call on us and allow one of our Specialists to examine him in every detail, we may make him A
WINNER IN THE RACE OF LIFE, build him up strong and healthy, and fit to take on any 'duty Life may
demand. All the value of existence is denied to the man who sick and puny recognises himself a failure in com-
parison with STRONG and STURDY men.
The Physician=in=Chief of Institutes,
DR. RICHARD WALLACE.
WOMEN, THINK OF THIS I
THE FREEMAN AND WALLACE INSTITUTE comprises FOUR FULLY QUALIFIED AND DULY REGISTERED
medical practitioners, as well as Experts in the diseases of men.
Each of them may be consulted personally, and their combined opinion obtained, by any who require it, and such will
be given Free, individually or collectively, FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD.
We believe in effective treatment and good results, because a cured man or woman is our best advertisement. This
fact, as well as our natural desire to treat everybodv fairly, causes us to deal honesth T and properly with the public. TEST
OUR CREDENTIALS, and realise our bona-fides. WE INVITE INQUIRY.

ACT TO-DAY.
The FREEMAN and WALLACE INSTITUTE solicits the most obstinate cases, and chal-
lenges the world. Blood disorders have baffled the skill of eminent physicians. For many
years the Institute has made a speciality of treating - such diseases, and it has UNLIMITED
CAPITAL BEHIND ITS UNDERTAKINGS.
You can be treated at home for the same price, and with the same guarantee. With those
who prefer to go to it, the Freeman and Wallace Institute will contract to cure them, or make
no charge, failing to cure. IS NOT THAT FAIR?
The FREEMAN and WALLACE INSTITUTE HAS A SPECIFIC FOR BLOOD POISON, and
cures it even in its worst forms, in MAN, WOMAN, or CHILD. It is a perfect antidote for the
powerful virus that pollutes the blood, and penetrates to all parts of the system. Unless you
get this poison out of your blood, it will ruin you. DISASTER FOLLOWS NEGLECT.
WONDERFUL CURES. We have to-day many patients upon our books who have tried in
vain at various medical sources to obtain relief, but failed. We have one specially, according to
his latest reports, who has consulted NINE REPUTABLE DOCTORS and TWO SPECIALISTS
in less than three years. He suffers from a Stomach Disorder, and has never been able to
assimilate food with any degree of satisfaction. He was a physical wreck, his mind melancholic
He took a course of our ELECTRO-MEDICAL TREATMENT, with strict orders to obey our
Dietary instructions. To quote from his letter, received only a few days ago :
“ I assure you your treatment is doing me good, for I am better, yes, better than I have

Remarks on Men’s Diseases
And Operations by the Freeman & Wallace Physicians & Surgeons.
There is no branch of medicine in which absolute keenness of diagnosis and a thorough
understanding of every detail of a case is so essential as in the treatment of diseases of the
Genito-Urinary Organs.
*"♦■*•****
It is now over 25 years since the Specialists of the Freeman & Wallace
Institute initiated their particular specialty—Diseases of Men— and in that time they have
operated in Australia alone on over 8000 eases of Varicocele and Stricture. Many other
operations they enumerate, difficult and dangerous feats of the Genito-Urinary Surgery.
Their treatment as regards Varicocele by Painless, Non-cutting, Non-contracting
and Bloodless operation is generally approved of.
They have been operating successfully for complicated cases of Varicocele, and have
seldom failed to cure a case, however long a time it had existed.
They have operated on patients from the age of six to the age of 84 years, in some cases
where the disease had existed for over 40 years.
As a Medical Institute they challenge any Firm in the world to show so large a
number of cases or such an unbroken line of successes.
***•*«*#
Some Questions Asked.— For the benefit of some patients who keep asking
questions, there is no Cutting or Blood Poisoning ; absolutely no pain.
The operation for Stricture or Varicocele never injures the vital power ; it is improved,
wasting stopped, no confinement, and patients can return home, if distant one thousand
miles, next day.

never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated, the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds; the disease,

No Doctors’ Bills Now.
After Being Wrecked by Chronic Indiges-
tion, Mrs. Plummer is Cured by Mother
Seigel’s Syrup.
“Five years ago,” says Mrs. Mary Plummer, of
417 Kent-street, Sydney, N.S.W., in a letter
addressed by her to the proprietors of Mother
Seigel’s Syrup, on April 28th, 1905, “nobody
would have insured my life for twopence. I had
suffered for a long while from chronic indigestion
which, besides causing excessive pain, had reduced
me to such a weak, nervous condition, that I was
almost afraid of my own shadow. Food disagreed
and distressed me so much that I actually dreaded
meal times. At night my sleep was fitful and in-
sufficent owing to palpitation of the heart, a
symptom that greatly alarmed me. Altogether, I
was in a very bad way, and my appearance plainly
showed it.
“The doctors I consulted said that my complaint
was chronic indigestion, and they specially
cautioned me against over-exertion and excite-
ment, as my heart was very weak.
“As time went on, my troubles grew upon me.
The medical treatment I received benefited me
nothing. At different stages of my illness I was
attended by four doctors ; but beyond keeping my
purse empty they did nothing for me. I there-
fore decided to seek other means of obtaining
relief.
“Having often seen Mother Seigel's Syrup
referred to in the newspapers as a sure cure for
indigestion, I resolved to try it, and at once bought
a bottle. It proved to be just the medicine I
required ; for after using it a little while I could
eat and sleep better, and was more comfortable in
every way. The improvement continued until
soon my health was quite restored. Thanks to
Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup, my health is now
good, and I have not seen a doctor’s bill for
years.”*

KIDNEY DISEASE CAN BE CURED.
From Mr. F. Andrews, farmer, Aspendale, via Mordialloc, Vic., 12th August, 1904.
“ Previous to about a year ago, I was remarkably healthy and strong, but my health then broke
down and I was seized with severe pain around my kidneys and heart. My appetite became very
capricious, and I began to lose flesh rapidly. When in that condition, not knowing what the outcome
would be, I heard of Warner’s Safe Cure from one who had taken that medicine, and began to take it
myself. I took it as directed, and it has completely and effectually cured me. I have had no return
of the trouble since.” ■■■■ •
From Mr. R. Bavinton, corner of Barkly and New Streets, North Brighton, Vic., 22nd March, 1905.
“For many years past I have been subject, at frequent intervals, to excruciating pain in the
region of the kidneys. Whilst the attacks lasted I used to suffer terribly, and, for some time, could
scarcely straighten my back, being bent almost double. lam inclined to think that the trouble was
first brought on by a severe strain which, in some way, affected the kidneys. I tried to obtain relief
by taking advertised remedies, but derived no permanent benefit until I took Warner’s Safe ; Cure. I
had only taken the contents of two bottles of Warner’s Safe Cure when the pain w,as entirely removed,
and I have since been able to do my work without pain or inconvenience.”
From Mr. P. Burns, Bootmaker, 162 Bourke-street, Sydney, N.S.W., 7th March, 1905.
“ Having caught a severe cold, which I unfortunately neglected, it ultimately developed into
kidney complaint. I suffered excruciating pain in the back, down my right side, and, at times, in the
region of my heart. I also had periodical attacks of piles, which gave me great trouble. I obtained
the advice of a doctor, who prescribed for me, but the medicine did me no good. On the advice of a
friend, who had derived great benefit from taking Warner’s Safe Cure, I decided on giving that
medicine a fair trial. I bought a bottle, and, as I found that it was doing me good, I continued to
take it, and soon became strong and free from pain, and was able to get about my work as well as
ever. I feel that it is my duty to recommend Warner’s Safe Cure to anyone suffering in a similar
manner.’’ '
From Mr. F. H. Davies, 11 Ada-street, South Fremantle, W.A., 27th October, 1904.
“ Two years ago I suffered terribly from pain in the small of the back, which was so severe that I
could not stand upright. A friend of mine, who had suffered in a like manner and was cured by
Warner’s Safe Cure, advised me to take.that medicine. I did so, and began to feel better after taking
the-first bottle. In a very short time all the disagreeable and painful symptoms disappeared, and I
was quite cured. I have had no return of the complaint, and can heartily recommend Warner’s Safe
Cure to all sufferers from kidney troubles.”
From Mrs. Mary Gordon, Second-street, Bowden, S.A., 3rd December, 1904.
“For a long time I suffered unceasing pain, almost torture, from chronic pain in my back, head
and sides. I was under the treatment, for several months, of one of the leading physicians of the city,
who said I was suffering from kidney disease, and treated me accordingly. Month after month went
past and I gradually got worse and weaker each week. Seeing that the course of treatment and
medicine was doing me no good, he, at last, decided that it would be necessary for me to undergo an
operation in order to effect a cure, and, if I did not consent to that, he could do nothing for me. At
that time I was in such a weak and helpless state that I felt sure an operation would only hasten my
. death, so I decided to consult a herbalist, who I had been told was very clever. After a short consul-
tation, he said that I was suffering from an abcess in the stomach, and that he could cure me for a sum
which it was beyond my means to pay. My husband, who had just got some work in the country,
sent me some money and advised me to buy some Warner’s Safe Cure, and take a course of it, as he
bad heard it well spoken of. I got some of the medicine and commenced to take it at once. In a few
days I began to feel better. I continued to take Warner’s Safe Cure, getting stronger each day, until
I was quite cured. The pain and weakness all left me, and I was once again able to do my household
work. lam quite convinced that Warner’s Safe Cure saved my life.”
From Mr. Joseph Mudkins, Burn-street, Invermay, Launceston, Tas., 10th October, 1904.
“Fourteen years ago I was cured of dropsy by taking Warner’s Safe Cure, and had no return of
the complaint until July last, when my feet, legs and eyes were so much swollen with dropsy that I
was laid up in bed. I took Warner’s Safe Cure again, and am thankful to say that lam now on my
feet again. I might also state that I have taken several vials of Warner’s Safe Pills. I heartily
recommend Warner’s Safe Cure and the Pills to any one suffering as I did from dropsy.”

From W. H. M‘Glew, Esq., J.P., Spnngside, Smith’s Hill, W.A., 11th November, 1903,
“Seventeen years ago I was suffering with Bright’s Disease of the kidneys,
treated by two doctors, and by them was given up as incurable. They 1
attending me for some time, and finally decided that it was impossible for me to re-
cover, and told me that I must prepare for the worst. The announcement came as a
great shock to me, and more to my wife and family, who were greatly distressed. At the
time my head and body were in an alarming state, being swollen right up to the eyes. I had a vague
feeling of unrest and tenderness in the kidneys; I suffered from extreme wakefulness, and gradual
failure of strength also, as I was not able to keep anything in my stomach. The fact that lam alive
to-day is, however, proof that doctors are not always correct when they tell you you are going to die.
I did not give up hope myself, and was determined to live as long as possible. Providentially, about
this time, one of Warner’s idafe Cure pamphlets was placed in my hands, and in it I read a
letter from someone who suffered from the same complaint, and had been cured by taking
Warner’s Safe Cure. I at once decided that, as the doctors said they could do no more
for me, I would give Warner’s Safe Cure a trial, and see if that would do me any
good. I sent immediately for a supply of Warner’s Safe Cure and a vial of Warners
Safe Pills, and commenced taking these medicines without delay, keeping strictly to the diet rules
given, which I believe to be most important, in order that the medicine may do its work witnou
hindrance. I did not at first inform the doctors that I was taking Warner’s Safe Cure, for tear tna
they might object to my doing so. After taking a few bottles I began to feel better, and this
faith to continue. The swelling in my head and body went down gradually, and my urinary trouD.es,
which had been very distressing, were completely banished. I continued to improve in heaitn, g S
strength each day. The doctors were delighted at my rapid and almost miraculous recovery,
when I informed them what medicine had produced the result, they would scarcely believe me.
few more weeks I had quite recovered my normal strength, and have since had no return oi t *
plaint, and am in as good health to-day as ever I was in my life. To prove that this is so, agen
insurance co.’s have offered to insure my life for any amount.

The Inky Way.
The appearance, some years ago, of the collected verse
of recently-deceased American statesman, John Hay, al-
most led to the sudden death from shock of an Australian
editor-manager-proprietor, now prominent in politics.
And all because the reviewer of the establishment, in
the innocence of his heart, quoted this :
How did he git thar? Angels.
He could never have walked in that storm ;
They jest swooped down and toted him
To whar it was safe and warm.
And I think that saving a little child,
And fetching him to his own,
Is a derned sight better business
Than loafing around The Throne.
The editor-manager-proprietor, dozing over a proof, came
to with a start on spotting this. Echoes of the tornado
that followed still roll round the premises. “Loafing!”
he cried at last after half-an-hour of badly-chosen obser-
vations ; “ Loafing around The Throne ! You might as
well call the archangels an unemployed deputation 1 ”

In the S.A. Assembly, not long since, Treasurer Peake
stated that, much as he respected Mr. Yardon (late Chief-
Sec.), it was no credit to him to own such a paper as the
Critic, which dealt with the “ seamy side of life,” and
with “ things that were discreditable to people.” This
was a good advt. for Vardon’s paper, but it wasn’t quite
correct. The Critic, from the jump, was more-or-less
namby-pamby in its methods. Now and again, Alf.
M’Kain broke out vigorously (that was in the days before
Vardon became proprietor), but eventually it always
reverted to the buttery personal par. and the “Amongst
those present were—” information. Recent editor was
C. J. Dennis, who was not stodgy enough for a stodgy
gentleman like Mr. Vardon. New editor is Conrad Con-
stantine Eitel, a young man who has received his train-
ing on the local Advertiser, and has written many things
about Langdon Bonython, and is therefore fully qualified
for the position of Butterer-in-chief.

F. Moy Thomas’s life of John Robinson, of London
Daily News, contains one or two Australian references.
Robinson was acquainted with Douglas Jerrold and
“ Orion ” Horne. When Horne came to Victoria with
William Ilowitt in 1852 he left his wife in London. After
waiting long and anxiously for some money from him, she
at last received a bulky letter. Tearing it open, she
found only some specimens of a curious Australian insect.
It was Horne of whom Jerrold said that he treated his
wife with “unremitting” kindness. Present writer
recently came across a copy of Theophile Gautier's “ Wan-
derings in Spain,” formerly owned by Horne and liberally
adorned with his notes, which give occasional glimpses of
his extensive travelling experience. In one he remarks :
“ I was once put in a dungeon where 1 could not see my
hands, yet in 24 hours I could discern the damp on the
walls.” This would probably be during Mexico’s war
with Spain. Horne was then a midshipman in the Mexi-
can navy (Mexico doesn’t run a navy now). ' Some rough
notes for verses at the end of the book show Horne to
have been included among the early writers of poems con-
cerning Australia.

Bendigo, besides producing much gold and many
singers, breeds pressmen enough to fill the Melbourne
newspapers’ staffs. On the Argus the chief of staff, the
cable editor, the sub-editor, the country sub-editor, one
leader-wu’iter, the mining reporter, and four other re-
porters are Bendigonians. Half-a-dozen others have
married Bendigo girls because it is said that no man gets
on in the place who is not either a Bendigdriian or mar-
ried to one. On the Age the editor, the sub-editor, and
three of the leading reporters hail from Bendigo, and all
learnt there th e A B 0 of journalism, reporting shire councils
almost verbatim , and generally doing three men’s work
for half a man’s pay. The chief of staff of the Melbourne
Evening Herald and the three star reporters on the same
papers are Bendigonians. It is small wonder that
Bendigo news always bulks large in the Melbourne dailies
and always secures pride of place over other country
happenings.

An Australian artist who spent some months in the
Cold Country a couple of years ago was surprised, the
other day, to see on a bookstall a penny London journal,
its front page decorated with one of his drawings bearing
the signature “ Hieronymus Smith,” or words to that
effect. Growing interested, he obtained a file of the
paper and found no less than half-a-dozen of his drawings
signed by different names. He sat down to think hard
over the mystery, and remembered how he had taken the
drawings in question to the office of the journal. An
urbane person at a counter bade him wait while they were
submitted to the editor, and after ah absence of half an
hour, or an hour, the urbane person returned with the
intimation that the editor regretted hone of the drawings
were suitable. There was only one explanation. During
that absence the desperately urbane brigand had photo-
graphed each picture-for future use. Remembering-how
he had been compelled to wait similarly in the outer offices
of several other respectable weekly journals, the artist
looked up more files, and discovered that he had been
rooked for nearly £5O worth of art. In some cases two
papers had stolen the same picture and published it the
same week. The artist is now hard at work turning off a
few masterpieces in order to raise the money for another
trip to London that he may institute proceedings against
certain affable spielers of that grey spot.

“G.H.”: Death of journalist Gilbert Smith recalls an
interesting but futile attempt made near Warrnambool
(Vic.) to acclimatise our ill-tempered brother from Asia’s
coral shore. About twenty-five years ago Smith was
imported from India by Thomas McLeod Palmer to act
as interpreter to his herd of colored cow-punchers at
Tooram. Palmer ran a mammoth cheese and bacon
publishing business ; and, in order to cut his wages-bill
to the lowest possible figure, imported 30 or 40 versions
of Chunder Lai to urge the cow to her vesper bail.
The brindle brethren worked well enough for a time, and
Palmer rolled his collective but peaceful cheese through
the land with great profit. When his aggregate cheese
amounted to a gasometer in point of size, Palmer sent to
India for another consignment of turbaned cow-urgers.
The move was fatal, because the second batch was of
different caste from the first lot; and consequently the
Tooram cheese-mill resolved itself into a brindled
Gehenna, filled with clods, pitchforks, johnny-cakes,
turbans, and the assorted curses of Ram Chunder,
Esq. Palmer attempted to tame his colored cheese-ists
in vain. He let up finally ; and the colored multitude of
cheese-trundlers arose and girded on the basket and
bundle of hawkerdom. While the cheese of Tooram still
rolled profitably over the landscape, Palmer contributed
£lOOO for the construction of a cottage at the Old
Colonists’ Home, Clifton Hill.

This time-worn notice appears in one of the press-rooms

THE PRESS ROOM.
Here is the place where wearied pressmen’s brains
Seek passing refuge from the mournful strains
Of egotistical members’ voices, tuned in doleful tones •
As, apeing the busy bee, they emulate the drones.
Poor old Melbourne Paunch still prates at times about
“the superior classes” —meaning' the butter pirates,

A quaint product of a flunkeyised country is the dedi-
cation of “ The New Border Tales,” by “Sir George Bris-
bane Scott-Douglas, Bart., J.P., D.L., country gentleman ;
owns about 5600 acres.” The description of this great
British author’s titles and possessions was supplied by
himself to “ Who’s Who,” and the dedication of “ The
Border Tales ” could have been written only by that sort
of person. In three pages of didactic platitude, “ your
attached friend and master ” inscribes the book to his
gamekeeper, and one hopes the ’umble menial is properly
sensible of the great honor. Douglas has also committed
“ Poems of a Country Gentleman,” and half-a-dozen other
volumes, which are presumably dedicated, with suitable
moral precepts, to the scullery-maid, the footman, and so
on. But fancy John, William, and Matilda having to pre-
tend they enjoy the abounding beauties of “master’s”

A HEALTHY LIFE
Professor F. H. Griffin,
M.D., wrote:
** I on ly w ish every soul in the world used
Kutnow s Powder ; they would experience
great benefit. Four of my family besides
myself use it regularly.” It is a splendid
corrective for liver disorders. It is as mild
as the purest water, but as certain as the
rising of the sun. It is delightfully refresh-
ing as a health-draught, and removes the
severest headache almost instanter.
Professor /. N. Love f
M.D., wrote:
1 The great surgeon, Professor Lawson
Tait, M.D., himself a sufferer from a gouty
diathesis, was not only one of the world’s
greatest surgeons, but an able physician and
a therapeutist. For years he found
Kutnow’s Powder of great value to him per-
sonally and in his practice, and this remedy
is one of the few he conspicuously endorsed
over his own signature. He realised, as all
careful, observing practitioners do, that it is
necessary to cleanse the system frequently,
to remove the debris of undigested food, and
to hasten the elimination of uric acid to
properly guard against serious disease. Kut-
now s Powder stimulates the activities of the
bowels and kidneys. A dessert-spoonful in
a tumblerful of water taken immediately on
rising in the morning cleans Out the bowels,
acts as a diluent, and flushes out the kidneys
in a most satisfactory way. Thorough
elimination is salvation, and there is no
better eliminator than Kutnow’s Powder.”

How to Secure Both.
How many people are there to-day in the British Isles who could
answer the greeting—“ How are you?” by saying, “Very well,
thanks ! ”
The percentage who could truthfully say, “ Very well, thanks,”
is very small, but really (with care) everyone ought to be always well.
Good health is your birthright, but, unfortunately, you have an
organ to keep in order called the liver, an unruly member.
y° u have a strong, active liver, you will lead a strong, active
life, but you must keep the liver up to the mark.
If you find a difficulty with the liver, be careful to avoid drugs,
mercurial pills, and all drastic remedies—they hurt.
Adopt Kutnow’s Powder, the liver encouraging remedy ; it acts
gently, yet, nevertheless, does its work with extraordinary efficiency.
I f y° u w ish to excel in brain-work you will find a dessert-spoon-
ful of Ivutnow’s Powder of immense benefit. The same applies to
every action of our daily life—work, play, sleep—no matter what
you do, if you would do it well you must keep the great organs of the
body in perfect working order. The stomach needs cleansing, the
h\ er stimulating, the kidneys flushing, and the bowels clearing.
Herein lies the whole secret of health, and Kutnow’s Powder does
this for you, and does it perfectly.
IMPORTANT CAUTION!
Kutnow s Powder is sold everywhere, but should you be shown a bottle
similar to the genuine Kutnow's Powder, bear in mind that to be
genuine every bottle must have the fac simile signature, “S. Kutnow
and Co., Ld.,” and the registered trade-mark, “ Hirschensprung, or
Deer Leap,” on the carton and label on the bottle. This signature
and trade-mark alone ensure your obtaining the
Genuine KUTNOW S POWDER
Dr. A. A. O’Neill, M.D.,
wrote:
“ Columbia Hospital, Chicago,
“June 10, 1904.
“It gives me pleasure to state with what
satisfaction I have used Kutnow’s Powder in
my practice. I find that it is one of the best
neutralisers, and at the same time a gentle
laxative and gastric sedative, which over-
comes the most distressing symptoms so
often remembered by patients with so much
dread. Given in small freshly made doses
every few minutes, it soon controls the
gastric distress, keeps up gentle peristalsis
and laxity, the importance of which surgeons
appreciate. “A. A. O’NEILL, M.D.”
Dr. W. R. Jones,

“I am constantly prescribing Kutnow’s
Powder, with invariably good results. I also
use it myself in order to regulate the

Beanie’s Bronchitis Core.
THCB FAMOUS 3REMIBDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN THE WORLD.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief ; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs ” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.
OF COUGHS !
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.
BRONCHITIS ard ASTHMA.
A COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER SUFFERING IN-
TENSELY SJURED BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
HAS SINCE CAMPED OUT AND TRAVELLED
MUCH WITHOUT CONTRACTING A COLD.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir,—ln 1898, I was for four years previously in
Queensland travelling: representative for a mercantile
house. Having contracted a heavy cold, I placed myself
under a medical man, and used all kinds of chemists’
prescriptions without avail. I was then staying at Hayes’
Terminus Hotel, Brisbane. The manager did all possible
for me, for which I shall always feel grateful. Mr. Duncan
Currie, at that time acting manager for the New York
Life Insurance Co., came to see me daily, and he advised
me to try your Bronchitis Cure. I was about done for,
could not eat, or scarcely swallow ; in fact, used to nearly
suffocate a dozen times a day, suffering intensely. Guess
of my thankfulness, when Mr, Curriebrought me a bottle
of your Bronchitis Cure. A few doses actually cured me.
I took another bottle away from the city with me, and
gave part of it to a young girl at Southport, and it also
saved her life. The balance I gave to Mr. T. McMillan,
Tweed River—three persons cured by your valuable
medicine. Although I have camped out and travelled
about 10,000 miles since my illness, I have not contracted
a cold since,—l am, Sir, your best well-wisher,

BRONCHITIS and ASTHMA.
A QUEENSLAND RESIDENT CURED BY HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS CURE.

NO SHORTNESS OF BREATH SINCE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—l had Bronchitis several
times since 1898 in Victoria, Western Australia, and here,
and had paid many pounds away in medicine ; but when I
arrived in Cairns in 1900 from Western Australia, I was
induced to try-your Bronchitis Cure. I took five bottles,
and it made a new man of me. I could afterwards run a
mile or climb up and down a vertical shaft without any
feeling of shortness of breath. No medicine for Bronchitis
that I have ever taken has afforded me such relief as your
Bronchitis Cure.—Yours faithfully,
RICHARD COLLINS, Mine Manager,
Ir-vinebank, via Cairns, North Queensland.

lungs ; the doctor says so, but his treatment has not done
me any good. My breathing is short, and I have a short

am very weak, and I perspire a lot at night, and my body
and lungs feel burning. lam getting worse. I feel

with cough, for five years, and during that time got
treatment from different sources, but derived no benefit

at once, and completely cured me. lam delighted with
it. It is a really wonderful medicine ; does good at once,
and can’t be licked.—Yours sincerely,
“W. TREMELLEN,
“ Modewarre, Victoria.”
ASTHMA—A SEVENTEEN YEARS CASE.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, writes : —“ After suffering from asthma for
seventeen years, and having been under a great many
different treatments without benefit, I was induced to try
Hearne’s Medicine for Asthma. After taking three
bottles of this medicine, I quite got rid of the Asthma,
and since then, which was the beginning of 1888—fifteen
years ago—l have not had the slightest return of: it. The
medicine quite cured me, and I have much pleasure in
recommending it.”
Writing again two years later, he states :—“ I am
keeping very well. Never have the slightest return of
the asthma.”

HUNDREDS CURED IN THEIR OWN CIRCLE.
The Scientific Australian Office,
169 Queen-street, Melbourne.
Dear Mr. Hearne, —The silent workers are frequently
the most effective, and if there is anybody in Victoria
who, during the last few years, has been repeatedly
working for and singing the praises of Hearne’s Bron-
chitis Cure, it is our Mr. Phillips.
This gentleman some three years ago was recommended
to try your Bronchitis Cure by Mr. Barham, accountant,
Collins-street, and the effect that it had was so marked
that he has ever since been continually recommending it
to others.
We are glad to add this our testimony to the value of
Hearne’s most valuable Bronchitis Cure, which has eased
the sufferings of hundreds and hundreds of people even
in our own circle of acquaintances.
Believe us always to be,
Yours most faithfully,

BOTTLE OF HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN SUFFERING FOR
TWELVE MONTHS.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I had a very bad cough, so I
bought one bottle of your Bronchitis Cure, and used about
one-half of it, which cured my cough in two or three days.
My daughter, who had been troubled with a bad cough
for the past twelve months, then used the remaining half
of the medicine, and it cured her also. I think your
Bronchitis Cure is a wonderful remedy.

CURES A
BAD SWELLING.
“ four or five weeks
ago,” says Mr. A. Gil-
bert, of 26 Bridport-
street, Albert Park, Melbourne,
“ I had a dreadful swelling on
the back of my hand. It looked
as if an abscess was forming. I
work on the wharves, but have
no idea of the cause of the
trouble. I poulticed it, but this
treatment did not benefit it at
all, and I was forced to lose
three days’ work, as, with the
pain and inconvenience the
swelling caused me, I could not
hope to follow my occupation.
During those three days I re-
ceived a sample pot of Zam-Buk
at the house, and applied it
in accordance with directions.
Three applications brought the
swelling to a head. It then
broke and exuded matter. I
then purchased a further supply
of Zam-Buk and applied it, and
in two days the wound was com-

pletely healed and my hand quite sound. My mates on the wharf were

were generally known, no workman would be without a pot handy.”

The Labors of Hercules.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HERCULES, whose birth was shady, was
the son of Jupiter
And a somewhat sinful lady ; but we
need not speak of her !
Place her character at zero; we are satisfied to
know
That the offspring was a hero, as his famous
Labors show.
Once (this yarn I am afraid’ll hardly do to state
on oath)
Two big snakes got in his cradle ; infant Herlcy
slew them both !
He eschewed the Path of Pleasure, so the ancient
scribes relate,
Holding Virtue as a treasure till he grew to man’s
estate.
Thespis then became his quarters, lions there he
slew with ease,
And the King’s fair fifty daughters all had sons to
Hercules !
With this item do not quarrel, let denunciation
cease,
Hercules was strictly moral—in the code of ancient
Greece !
But his jealous elder brother whom, they said, he
must obey,
Sought the hero’s fame to smother in a cruel,
vengeful way.
That’s how Hercules was ordered to achieve those
doughty deeds
Which for magnitude oft bordered on the fairy
tales one reads !
Now the hero’s wondrous Labors let me briefly
summarise,
For he blared no fifes and tabors o’er his deeds of
high emprise.
Labor First: This worthy scion beat till he was
out of breath
Nemea’s ferocious lion, and then choked the brute
to death !
Labor Second : ’Twas a wonder, for Olympia’s
mighty son
Killed the Hydra, knocked him under, without
spear or sword or gun !
Labor Third : In famed Helvetia Hercules, to
show his worth,
Caught the stag of Artemisia ! ’Twas the fleetest
stag on earth!
Labor Fourth : With just a net he caught a wild
and savage boar.
(This, to me, seems somewhat petty; Roberts
caught at least a score!)
Labor Fifth : He cleansed a stable where three
thousand oxen slept—
It was vile, so says the fable; thick with grime
and badly kept!
Labor Sixth : Somehow or other—so the aged
legends tell—
Hercules, to please his brother, dragged the
watchdog out of hell!
Labors Seven to Twelve were made of more
amazing matters yet,
For the giant rose and paid off the Australian
Public Debt.

W. T. GOODGE.
A Temporary Engagement.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE last handful of rice had been thrown,
and, with much fluttering of skirts, giggling
and crushing, the wedding party sorted
itself into several cabs and drove off to get its
photograph taken. Mr. Porter, leaning gracefully
against the horse-trough outside the “Hen and
Chickens,” in converse with Miss Sadie Fitz-
gomery, who manipulated the beer-engines in that
establishment, watched the cortege go past with
meditative eye.
“Only fools marry,” he remarked, oracularly.
Miss Fitzgomery sniffed disdainfully.
“ You aren’t married yet,” she said, pointedly.
“That’s the miracle,” he answered, gazing at
his reflection in the horse-trough. “Just becos a
man has a good position an’, though I sav it as
shouldn’t, a good—ahem—appearance, all the
wimmin in the country runs arter ’im.”
“Well, of all the conceited animals !” began
Miss Sadie. Then, as words failed her, she turned
her back and disappeared inside. After gazing
once more at his reflection in the water, Mr.
Porter curled his moustache and strolled carelessly
off.
* * •
“Bill J” said Miss Fitzgomery.
“ ’Ullo ! ” said the gentleman addressed, ad-
vancing to the bar counter.
“ Will you do me a favor ? ”
“Favor!” exclaimed Bill; “y’ know I’d do
most anything for y’— marry y’, square an’ all.”
“That wouldn’t be a favor,” answered the lady.
“And I thought we weren’t going to mention
that again. However, there’s something I want
you to help me in. You know Mr. Porter ? ”
“ Know Mister Porter ! Know Mister Porter ! ”
A gleam of intelligence showed for a moment in
Bill’s bloodshot eye. “D’y* want me ter stoush
im ? ” he inquired softly.
“No ! ” said Miss Sadie decidedly. “I want to
funish him, but in another way. How long have
known you, Bill ? ”
Bill’s knubbly fingers executed what sounded
like a sand-dance over his massive and bristly chin,
while his small red orbs sought inspiration from
the ceiling.
Fer years an’ years,” he said vaguely, after
much mental calculation. “ ’Fore even I beat Tot
Willis in ’9l in ther 15th round. Y’ was a little
Int ov a nipper then, wi’ brown stockin’s an

‘‘Bill!” exclaimed Miss Sadie sharply, and he
desisted from his embarrassing reflections.
“Mr. Porter was very rude to me to-day,” con-
tinued the young lady; “as much as said I was
throwing myself at him.”
Bill breathed hard and clenched his fists.
“ Wait till I t’rows my fist at ’is ’ead,” iie mut-
tered.
So I want you (Miss Fitzgomery giggled
embarrassedly). “ It’s such a strange thing for a
girl to ask (she held, the towel with which she
burnished the glasses in front of her face to hide
her blushes). “I want you just to pretend, you
know—that we—he-he—are engaged. Just make
believe, you know.
Bill blinked at her dully.
“ Say that again,” he said.
“Make believe we’re engaged—just pretend,
you know —and then I shall tell Mr. Porter, and
think how small he’ll feel after his impertinence.
It’ll be such fun—just pretending, of course.”
“ O’ course,” assented Bill dully.
“And then, in a week or so, we can tell him it
was a joke, and have the laugh at him.”
“O’ course,” said Bill.
“You’ll have to borrow some sort of ring for
me—just to keep up the pretence, of course.”
“O’ course,” said Bill again.
“ And afterwards I can give it back to you.”
“O’ course,” said Bill.
He finished his beer and went outside into the
street and looked at the lamp-post in a dazed
way.
“O’ course,” he muttered softly to himself.
* * m *
“Oh, Bill, what a lovely ring!” exclaimed
Miss Fitzgomery, holding her finger under the
light. “ Wherever did you borrow it ? ”
“Friend o' mine,” answered Bill, laconically.
“A jeweller?”
“Not eggsactly—general dealer. Picks up any
little odds an’ ends, y’ know.”
“ Well, I must take care not to lose it,” said
Miss Sadie, breathing on it gently and polishing
it on her dress. “He could get a lot for it.”
“Yes,” muttered Bill, absently, “a couple o’
years 1 ”
“Quick!” exclaimed the lady, “here’s Mr.
Porter. Go away now, and come back when I
drop the tray.”
As Bill bustled out of the side-door, Mr. Porter
and the odor of a strong German cigar entered the
bar together. He wore a startling thing in ties, a
large button-hole, and a proprietary air.
“ Good evenin’, my dear,” he said.
The lady said “Good evening” sweetly, and
leant her soft, rounded chin on her hand and
flashed her borrowed diamonds in the gaslight.
“ ’Alio ! ” exclaimed the elegant Porter. “Did
you get it outer a surprise-packet ? ”
“ Well, it was a bit of a surprise,” she answered
demurely ; “ although, of course, I’ve known him
all these years.”
Mr. Porter gulped noisily*
“ W’at d’you mean ? Who ? ”
“ Bill,” she whispered, and hid her pretty face
in her handkerchief. There was a long pause*
“You don’t mean—not engaged?” he gasped
at last.
“Yes,” said the lady ; “he asked me just after
you were so rude this afternoon.”
The man groaned. “ You surely ain’t serious?”
he asked. For answer, Miss Fitzgomery flashed
the ring in his eyes.
“ Oh, Lord ! ’ere ’ave I bin doin’ me ’Ouse up*
gettin’ ready to ask you—bein’ tired of bein’
single ; new paper in the sittin’ room, and the
kitchen and the fowl ’ouse whitewashed, an’ a
new sink, an’—an’ all. Gi’ us a brandy quick.
Oh, it’s ’orrible—’orrible 1 An’ me, for months
an’ months, tryin’ to decide between you an’ Katie
Smith ; and then when me ’eart tells me it’s you
I loves, I’m—l’m too late.”
The poor man tossed off his brandy and lurched
dejectedly towards the door.
“Good-a-bye—it’ll ’ave to be Katie Smith after
all.”
“George !” said Sadie, softly.
“ Eh ! ” he exclaimed, his hand on the door.
“ Come back, dear ; it was all a joke.”
Then she explained to him how, partly to punish
him for his rudeness and partly out of love for
him, she had hatched the scheme with Bill’s
assistance to give him a shock.
“Dear old Bill !” cooed Sadie.
“Good ole Bill! ” echoed George.
• » *
Bill was waiting patiently in the passage for the
sound of the falling tray. He knew better than
to act without Miss Fitzgomery’s orders. Bitter
and long experience had taught him (who was the
pride and terror of the city) that it was not advis-
able to disobey that imperious lady’s behests. He
did some hard thinking, however. “If I knocks
the squib abart, she’ll fuss over ’im worse’n ever,”
he muttered, “ ’cos she’s got a soft ’eart, an’ when-
ever I comes to ’er cut about, she treats me like a
bloomin’ sick kitten. Now if ”
Then Bill had an idea, and, pushing open the
door, he entered the bar. The fond couple inside
hastily disentangled themselves. “ W’at in ’ell’s
the meanin’ o’ this?” shouted the enraged Bill.
“It—it—it’s all right, Bill, ole man,” replied
Porter. “ Sadie’s explained your little joke, an’
we’ve fixed it all up.”
“I’ll fix y’ all hup, y’ joker,” snarled Bill,
savagely. “I’ll ’ave y’ know that that young
woman is engaged to marry me.”
“Ha! ha!” laughed Mr. Porter, mirthlessly,
“you will ’ave your little joke out. But it’s
all right, Bill; she’s tole me all about it.”
“It’s all right, Bill,” said the lady. “He
knows. I told him.”
“ Well, if y’ tole ’im, an’ ’e knows we’s engaged
ter be spliced, w’at does ’e mean by cuddlin’ y’
like ’e was jist now ? ”
“ There now, Bill, ole pal,” began Porter,
soothingly.
“Don’t y’ talk ter me,” roared Bill, “much
less to ’er. ’Ere, git out! ”
He grabbed the astonished Porter by various
slack parts of his attire and bundled him on to the
pavement, heedless of the hysterical cries of the
agonised Miss Fitzgomery.
* * * *
An hour later the handsome head belonging to
George Porter was cautiously thrust through the
bar door. Seeing Miss Fitzgomery alone, the rest
of that gentleman entered boldly.
“Didn’t wanter make a scene in fronter you,”
he explained, “so I waited till I got ’im outside.
But this ’ere’s a nice thing you’ve started. What
am I goin’ to do about Bill ? ”
Miss Sadie shrugged her shoulders despairingly.
“ Seems as if Bill has misunderstood our little
joke,” she said. “I might have known. He’s
likp a bull-dog. Once he gets a hold, he’ll never
let go. You’ll have to fight him, and beat him
too, before he’ll give me up.”
Mr. Porter was in the act of lighting a cigar.
“Wha—what?’’ he stammered, holding the
match in mid air.
“Fight him,” answered she, determinedly.
“You arn’t afraid, I suppose.”
“A-a-fraid! No! Only the fact is I once near
killed a man in a fight, an’ I vowed I’d never fight
agen. I’m terrible when I’m worked up. I could
’ardly restrain meself jist now.”
“You managed to restrain yourself, ” said Sadie.
“ However, Bill can look after himself.”
That did not seem to console Mr. Porter.
At that moment the door swung open with a
bang, and Bill entered.
“Ho!’’ he said. “Y’ ’ere agen, eh ! ”
Methodically he removed his coat, rolled up his
sleeves, began prancing round the bar, hitting
gently at the atmosphere, and invited the terrified
Porter to “ come hon.”
“Go on, George,” said Miss Fitzgomery en-
couragingly.
Porter looked longingly at the door, then at the
window, then at the girl. There was no help for
it, so very slowly he began to remove his coat and
vest, folding them carefully. This done, he shut
his eyes tightly and rushed wildly at Bill, at the
same time flinging his fist out as if he never wished
to see it again. It landed on Bill’s brawny chest
like a dew-drop from heaven falling on the broad
bosom of the ocean. With a crash Bill measured
his length on the floor, and lay there groaning and
writhing. His assailant opened his eyes and then
rubbed them dazedly.
He stood looking at the prostrate Bill for a
long time, then turned to the shrieking Miss Fitz-
gomery, and said, in tones which strove to be
calm, “I tole you so. You don’t know my
strength.”
But the agonised bar-lady was bending over
Bill, sobbing and striving to call him back to life
with endearing epithets. The landlord and the rest
of the household had rushed in, and were giving
advice and getting in each other’s way. The vic-
torious Porter resumed his garments. “ I tole you
so,” he repeated to Sadie. The lady rose to her
feet, and drew herself to her full height.
“Go ! ” she shouted, dramatically pointing to
the door. “Go, you—you assassin! You hav#
killed the only man I shall ever love.”
Bill opened one eye cautiously, and grinned.
“But—but”—began the bewildered victor.
“Go !” shrieked Sadie, working herself into a
frenzy, and advancing on her late knight-errant.
“Go ! ”
Mr. Porter went.
* * * *
Out in the street he paused. He felt the mus-
cles in his arm for some ten minutes. “ Either,”
he said, thoughtfully and sadly, “either I possess
wonderful hitting power, or—or I've bin fooled.”
He moved off slowly in the direction of Miss
Katie Smith's domicile.
“I wonder,” he muttered.

Doan's Backache Kidney Pills cure Inflammation of
the Kidneys and Bladder, Pain or Dull Ache
in the Back, Joints and Muscles; cure
Gravel, Weak Heart, Nervousness,
and all Urinary Troubles.
If you have any form of Kidney Trouble, would it not
be well to follow the advice of a neighbor—someone you
may know ? Head the case given below—perhaps you
may know Mr. Boyd. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills heal
and tone up the kidneys, and help them to keep the body
healthy, and free from kidney poisons. This medicine is
for men and women, old and young, and is always safe
and reliable.
A LASTING SYDNEY CURE.
TOLD IN 1902. PROVED IN 1905.
Mr. S. Boyd, 17 St. Andrew’s-street, Balmain, this city, says : —“Bor
twenty years I have suffered more or less with my back. I think it was
caused by the kidneys. A little over two years ago I seemed to collapse
altogether. It was the worst bout of backache that I ever had. The strike
was on at the time, so it happened that I was not working. I would not
have been able to work in any case ; I was too bad—in fact I was completely
done up. I began taking everything I was advised to take, but got no
relief. At last a friend advised me to try Doan’s Backache Kidney Tills.
I got this remedy, and ten boxes made a permanent cure in my case. It
was a real good cure in my case. I had been bad for so long. lam quite
satisfied Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills will do as much for others suffering
with backache.”
Mrs. Boyd confirms the above in Feb., ’O5 :—“My husband has had no
return of the backache since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured him. He
is three years cured now. He used the Pills thoroughly at the time. He is
60 years old now, and can do a day’s work as well as anyone. ’’
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at
2s. 9d. per box (six boxes, 15s. 3d.), or will be posted on receipt of price by
Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt-street, Sydney.

Don’t Neglect.
A COMMON CASE OF PILES.
It Mat Lead to Serious Results.
When people generally understand that
all such fatal diseases as fistula, ulcer of the
rectum, fissure, etc., almost invariably begin
in a simple case of Piles, they will learn the
wisdom of taking prompt treatment for the
first appearance of trouble in this quarter.
Doan’s Ointment will certainly cure every
form of piles—itching, bleeding, protruding
and blind piles—and hundreds of lives have
been saved by using this cheap but effective
remedy right at the start, because at such
times a single pot will effect a cure, while in
the old, deep-seated, chronic cases several
pots are sometimes required before a cure is
effected. Here is a case in point
Mr. William Gilliver, of Gilliver and
Curtis, General Contractors, whose private
address is “ Avoca, ” Bankstown, writes us,
December 10, 1900 :
“ I wrote you February 14, 1899, advisiijg
you that Doan’s Ointment had cured me of
itching piles, after twenty-two years’ afflic-
tion. I had let six months go by before I
wrote that letter, as I wished to see whether
the cure was a permanent one. I had used
many remedies in these twenty-two years’
trouble, and could scarcely believe that only
half a pot of ointment could work such a
cure. Since I wrote that last letter I have
had more lasting proof of the durability of
the good this preparation has done me. I
have not had occasion to use the ointment
since. It was a permanent cure. Many
people wrote to me about the value of Doan’s
Ointment, and I advised them to give it a
trial, and then let me know the results. In
consequence I have received many letters
telling me of cures effected by Doan’s Oint-
ment.”
I cannot be repeated too often that Doan’s
Ointment will cure itching piles. It will
cure them absolutely. But do not take our
word for it. Write to Mr. Gilliver and ask
him. He knows. It is for sale by all
chemists and storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per box
(six boxes 15s. 3d), or will be posted on receipt
of the price by Foster-McClellan Co., 76Pitt-
street, Sydney, N.S.W.
But be sure it is DOAN’S.
Funeral March.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HUSH ! let the hearse go by !
Robed in his piteous pretence,
Upon his triumph high
Let the proud dead ride by !
Humble your head ; allow
To that weak mortal brow,
Crowned with Death’s majesty, due reverence :
He is monarch now.
Down the loud-surging street
He passes imperturbable ; for he
Has won beyond defeat,
Is victor of the street;
For he through youth and age
Has passed each ’prentice-stage,
And now with strutting pomp and pageantry
Comes to his heritage.
For he is now Death’s friend,
Can walk abroad and talk familiarly
With him, and have him bend
Above him—Death, his friend !
And, satisfied and calm,
His soul has this for balm :
He is the chosen comrade ; only he
May link in Death’s his arm !
Perhaps he had a soul
Within this worn-out body. Did it wake
And strive toward some far goal ?
Surely he had a soul !
For he was once a child,
With ceaseless hope beguiled,
With all this world for toy, to love—and break
Now he is reconciled.
Yes, dowered he was with soul,
But only dimly. In a misty maze,
How could he see life whole
From that poor clouded soul ?
How could he read aright
The vagueness of his sight ?
The God who clogged his senses, dulled his gaze,
Knows well he must requite !
Yet he one moment clear
Had glimpsed at God, been subtly conscious of
Some new need, warm and near.
On some dim noon-night, clear
Had heard above him beat
One moment, and retreat,
The vast-spread wings of God’s wide-brooding
love
And known one woman sweet!
And she who dries her tears
Once kissed him madly, called him “Dearest!”
Fie !
Life must be lived, my dears,
And widows dry their tears !
Yet in a sorrow dim,
Though eyes no longer swim,
She dully questions, asks God why ? and why ?
Yearns sullenly for him.
She was a common girl;
A million more like her have gone to Death
For swine ; perhaps, a pearl,
This wife, this common girl.
And one day rapt he stood,
Caught her in a new mood,
Saw her divine, like her of Nazareth,
With whispered motherhood!
And when the wonder came,
How he had halted, made rude reverence,
Blinking as to a flame " t ,
When he before her came !
It seemed he had defiled
That mother, frail and mild ;
As from a shrine profaned had hurried thence.
And left her with her child.
Ah ! but he flouted Death
With children growing, grasping life; each birth,
Each querulous cry, each breath
A challenge to chill Death !
And now his work is done,
And he is tired and gone—
This is the epitaph of grateful earth—
“ Life’s torch he handed on.”
He builded something here;
On work’s cairn piled his stone; he did nob shirk
The duty mean and near.
Something he builded here.
He labored, till at last,
Long years of toil amassed,
He died, a splendid plutocrat of work :
Pause, till the hearse has passed !
This is the end of all.
He failed, was wilful, weak; he squandered much
God gave to him. This pall,
This hearse, the end of all ?
Nothing heroic here,
This dumb life, grey and drear —
Yet if he managed some dim truth to touch...
He does not need your tear.
Judge him ? You do not dare !
Each has his separate Universe; how then
By that poor symbol there
Judge him ? You do not dare !
His was the sordid lot,
Soon finished, soon forgot;
He went the common, easy way. Ah, men !
Ah, God!—judge not—judge not!
Ready was he for rest,
And tired of all this turmoil, where his way
He could not see. ’ So best
Beside the path to rest.
Yon question me, can I
Some distant hope descry ?
You ask me?... Is there aught but this to say ?
“Hush ! let the hearse go by.’’

ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
A Strategist.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAPPENED once to be cast up in a
Western township in the great “ wool belt.”
It was the kind of place a man finds himself
when he is in a dream, and he wakes up
shivering to find that it was only a dream.
The pub. I was staying at had been selected
a couple of weeks previously by a big hairy
savage as a fitting place to become reck-
lessly and improvidently drunk. After spend-
ing two glorious weeks in the company of beauti-
ful nymphs and Bacchanalian good fellows, born
of Western rum, he found himself in the. company
of blue and green swamp turtles and lurid crabs.
It was the natural sequence, and he accepted it
with not too good a grace. Clad in a grimace and
armed with a tomahawk, he had fled to the best
bedroom of the pub. and commenced a Trojan war
against the swarming horrors. Through the closed
door came the sound of wild demoniacal yells, the
splintering crash of wood, and the shattering of
crockery. The landlord groaned aloud for his
eight guinea “ plush and tapestry suite,” but none
dared try and extricate him. In vain, Bung
offered a bribe—£l, £2, £3—to the man who
would rid him of this truculent drunk. Bill
the “Bullock Charmer,” spurred on by the
thoughts of the £3, approached the door, and,
during a momentary lull, knocked softly. Imme-
diately there was a crash, and 3m. of tomahawk
came through a panel. Bill retired hurriedly.
We then gathered in the bar, and listened
apprehensively to the sounds of destruction. A
small quiet-looking man entered, and dumped a
shabby matilda. “Say, boss,” he addressed the
landlord, “I’m stony broke; give us a beer.”
“ Ter ’ell with yer ! ” said the landlord, hotly.
He was usually a humane man, but the stress of
the last hour had been too much for his temper.
“Look ’ere,” he resumed suddenly, “there’s a
blasted ’ideous loonatic in my best room with a
tominyhawk, smashing the place up. If yer can
get ’im out I’ll keep yer for a month.” The little
man’s eyes glistened. I noticed that he had the
bulging forehead of a thinker. “ Give us a pint,”
he said, “ ter ’elp me think.”
Bung complied, and for a few minutes the small
man thought in silence, everyone’s eye upon him.
Suddenly he said: “Got it; give us a pickle-
bottle_ and a cork.” When they were procured he
left his swag as a pledge of good faith, and started
off to an old stable at the back of the pub. He
returned in about half an hour with the bottle
wrapped in a piece of old newspaper. He carried
a strong smell of cow-dung smoke with him as he
entered and made his way down the passage.
Halting before the door, behind which the tumult
raged, he took the bottle from its wrapping. To
us it seemed to contain a brown indistinct mass.
“Yer don’t mind,” he said, turning to Bung,
“if I smash the fanlight, do yer?” “It don’t
make no difference,” was the reply ; “ most every-
thing else is broke. ” “Well, then, you blokes,
get into the bar.”
He pitched the bottle through the fanlight, and
raced for the bar, and slammed the door. There
was silence in the “best bedroom” for a few
seconds. Then there burst forth the most awful
shrieks I ever listened to.
There was a sound of a door smashed open,
followed by the wild flight of naked feet. We
gazed at each other for a few moments. Then the
silence was broken by the landlord in an awed
voice: “ What the ’ell was in that bottle?” he
asked.
“’Ornets,” said the man with the bulging fore-
head.
C.B.H.
A Visitation of Providence.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was Xmas Eve. And a cloudy, muggy
day—the sort of day that makes one think
it is raining though it isn’t and when the flies
are the devil. They were worse than the devil this
day.
Bullamon shed, on the Moonie, had just cut
out, and O’Dowd, an adjacent publican, taking
time by the forelock, hurried up to arrange a day’s
races for the enjoyment of the shearers and the
benefit of himself. Western publicans rarely allow
the shearers to leave their district without a send-
off. That’s about all they ever do send them off
with !
O’Dowd owned his own racecourse. His pub.
stood on the inside rim of it; his lamp-post stood
on the outside rim of it. The first horse past the
bar-door won, and the bar got the stakes.
They were betting recklessly—betting in
cheques—and I thought I saw the chance I had
been waiting for with my little mare, Black
Beetle. She was a swift one, and I got her —well,
it doesn’t matter where I got her.
First I said casually I’d a good mind to enter
my old moke for the hurry-skurry. That was
enough. There was no drawing back, and before
you could yell “Police!” two or three of them
were dragging her along by the bridle. No less
than three of them got into the saddle to ride her
for me. But I wasn’t having any circus business
just then. I caught hold of a likely-looking
youngster, and lifted him on, and gave him a few
instructions and a couple of half-crowns to go on
with.
Then I allowed the mugs to make wagers with
me. And how did they bite ! About fifty pounds
was as good as mine. And how was I in need of
it ! I hadn’t a bob.
They lined up to the starter, and you could
hardly see a horse for flies. The mare began to
brighten up a bit—she had been at the starting-
post before. I leaned against the lamp-post and
chuckled. A couple of the field broke away, but
Black Beetle stood quietly, and the boy sat
steadily. I chuckled some more.
A greasy, drunken, dirty, half-caste approached
the mare with a large can of treacle in nis hand,
and started pouring it all over her and the boy.
“Damn you,” I yelled, and rushed down, but
Long Pierce, the starter, said “Off!” and away
they went.
The mare came in absolutely last, carrying
2cwt. extra weight—-of flies.
The mugs regarded it as a huge joke, and held
out their hairy paws for me to pay up. I per-
formed, and lodged a protest for interference.
The committee met right away in the bar, and
called in the half-caste to. give evidence. He
attended with a long beer in his hand, and his
head in the empty can, and rivulets of treacle
trickling down his chest, and denied everything.
“There’s nothing in it, young man,” said
O’Dowd to me. “Not a damn thing. Flies is
only the natural visitation of Providence.”
I had to hand over the mare in payment.

“My wife has all her life long been
subject to rush of blood to the head
and fainting-fits. In later years these
were more frequent, and her skin be-
came very sallow. She had scarcely
any appetite, and it was not safe to
leave her at home by herself for fear
of a fainting-fit. I may state we had
medical advice both in England and
here in New Zealand, but it did no
good; so, some months back, I sug-
gested that she take Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. She protested against it, be-
lieving it to be quackery, but I pur-
chased a bottle just to give it a trial,
and the result was marvelous. Mrs.
Moul has taken five bottles, and now
she is a new creature.
“I forward yon her photo by this mail, and you can make what use
you think proper of this statement. Yours gratefully.” — John F.
Moul, Ty-Coed, Swanson, Auckland.
“P.S. I omitted stating that the photo was taken since using the
Sarsaparilla.”
Be sure you get the right kind of Sarsaparilla—“AYEß’S.” Don’t
lev anybody induce you to try some other kind. You will regret it
If you do.
If you are not in good, vigorous health, if your nerves are not so
Strong as you wish, if you are feeling run down and depressed, buy
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
today and begin the certain cure.

WILFLEY v. CARD CONCENTRATOR.
The judgment in the recent law suit does not apply to the original Card Concentrator, but only to two experimental
Table Tops that were made for the purpose of trial during the absence of Mr. Guthridge from Australia, and before
the work:’ng of the Table was properly understood. We are, therefore, continuing the manufacture and sale of these
machines, and the mining industry will not be deprived of this valuable invention. According to the sworn evidence,
the “ Card” has 50 per cent. “ greater capacity and makes higher concentrates and poorer tailings than the £ Wilfley.’
With the £ Card J there is practically no loss oi: lead (mineral), as there is with the £ Wilfley.’ ”
The £C Card ’’ Table may be seen on application, when evidence of its great superiority will be furnished.
